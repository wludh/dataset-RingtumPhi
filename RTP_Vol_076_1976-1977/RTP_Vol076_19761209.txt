by DOUG DEWING

Livingston Taylor and the At-
lanta Rhythm Section will be the
performers for this vear’s Winter
concert, according to sources on
the Student Activities Board.

The concert is tentatively sche-
diled for Friday, Jan. 21, in the
old gym.

When asked aboul the conceri,
SAB co-chairmen Mike Armstrong
refused to confirm the idenity of
the acts and would only say that a
contract has heen signed.

‘We don’t want .o promise one

up a have them cancel out,”
he e said. “The contract has a state-
ment which says performers have
the right to teiminate up to 3)
days before the concert.”

The last day the bands could
cancel out is Tuesday, Dec. 21

The SAB is trying to arrange

debate need

Monday night’s E. C. meeting
was the scene of a heated discus-
sion between first-year law repre-

»ntative Rick Goddard and Al-
fred Robinson, President of the In-
ter-Fraternity Council.

Goddard asked Robinson why
the IFC had not investigated an
accident that occurred at the SAE
ifalloween party. Robinson replied
that the Student Control Commit-
tee had looked into it, but that the
IFC had not and would not, as the
incident was purely accidental

This explanation did not satisfy
Goddard, who said an investiga-
‘(ion would bring out the facts. He
said he could not accept the Ring-
tum Phi article on the incident as
an efficient explanation of the
event.

Kappa Alpha to gain charter

by REID SLAUGHTER

After two years as a provisional
chapter, the historic Kappa Alpha
Order at W&L wil receive a new
charter in January, perhaps signi-
fying a new era for KA.

Once considered to be the stron-
gest house on campus, the Alpha
Chapter of KA enjoys a rich his-
tory dating back to 1865, when
four Washington College students
founded the order. They named
President Robert E. Lee as its

E. C. rep.
for probe

currence was an accident, asked
Goddard why he had waited so
long to bring the matter up. He
also stated that an investigation
would tediously drag the matte:
on, possibly causing emotional
hardships for the persons involved
in the incident.

Robinson suggested that God-
dard should question the officers
of the fraternity in private, rather
than push for an investigation

Walt Kelley then pointed out
that the discussion was pointless
as the IFC did not have to investi
gate

Goddard explained to Robinson
that he was new to W&L and still
unsure how all the commiitees
worked, and he had thought an in
vestigation might be fruitful

spiritual leader, as he was thought
to be “the embodiment of a true
Southern gentleman” and a mode!
for every KA member.

In more recent years, KA got
literally too big for itself. Factions
and cliques developed and soon,
torn by dissension among its mem-

bers and frustrated by financial
straits, the house collapsed in
1970. The house itself was sold,

and most of the remaining mem-

bers drifted into other fraterni-
ties.
In 1974, Matt Donaldson, the

current president, and cight oth
ers decided to revive KA. Dissatis-
fied with certain aspects of other
fraternities, the group wanted to
form their own approach to fra-
ternity life. With some financial
backing they were able to lease
the old Psi Upsilon house on Nel-
son St. and began operating from
there last year.

There had been many attempts
to restore the KA chapter to W&L,
but this was the first successful
attempt. It was not an easy task
however.

One week before school ended

thot first year, the house found
out it would be allowed to go

through Rush the next year, as a
provisional house. After a long
summer of preparation, the KA’s
went through Rush and gained
six pledges. This year, they went
through Rush as a_ provisional
house again, and gained 18
enough to bring them to
full active status

Dr. Edwin D. Craun, assistan!

W&L, Oxford
to trade profs

Oxford Univer.ity’s oldest com
ponent, University College, and
W&L have announced a faculty-
exchange program, to be inaugui
ated next fall.

Under the program, professors
from the prestigious British uni
versity will spend a term or a
full academic year  teac hing
classes at W&L. In turn, W&L pro
fessors will have the opportunity
to spend sabbaticals at Oxford.
principally to conduct research.

The program announced

onday on the occasion of a visit
to W&L by the retired master of
University College, Lord Red
cliffe-Maud.

The W&L-Oxford exchange was
developed in large measure by
Redcliffe-Maud, who retired last
summer after 16 years as master,
and Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, pro-
fessor of psychology at W&L, who
spent the 1975-76 academic year
at University College.

The College, deseribed the un-
usual new exchange program as

‘a Most extraordinary opportunity

and, we hope, for the faculty and

udents at University College as
well.”

The Committee on the Automa-
tic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m. on
Wednesday, December 22, 1976.
At that time the Committee will
consider the following groups of
students, who have fallen under
the Automatic Rule, for possible
immediate reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to

meet the conditions of Aca

demic Probation required of
them at the end of the cur
rent Fall Term.

2. those students completing a
full academic year who failed
to meet the cumulative aver
ige required of their class

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement all
rudents who fall under the Avto-
matic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of ex
tenuating circumstances present

gathering require—and is there
any money left from this year?
Trump: What we're shooting for
is to try and keep it around the
figure because money is
ht right now in all areas of the
‘conomy. We're going to try to
keep it as minimal as we can and

ime

vel try to do as good a job as we

conference yields plan

They paved paradise but will
not put up a parking lot.

They may, however, decide to
designate at least one lot for use
by Woods Creek residents only.

That was the upshot of a meet
ing Monday afternoon between a
bare quorum of the Executive
Committee and a delegation from
Washington Hall.

The E.C. met with President
R.E.R. Huntley, Assistant to the
President Frank Parsons, Dean of
Students Lewis John and Tom
Borellis, a representative of the
Pittsburg landseaping firm which
designed the layout of the lunar
landscape across the apartments.

Huntley said the area across the
street from the apartments had
not been used for parking because
it was neither scenic to have the
cars sitting there nor safe to have
them backing out of perpendicu-
lar spaces into the access road.
One Woods Creek dweller,
Jim Falk, did not agree that back
ing into the road would create a
safety hazard. “I liked the way
they talked about that little road
like it was an interstate,” he said
later

\nother apartment resident
Peter Keefe, argued that the
placement of rocks (.e., massive
boulders, paving stones for a
transAtlantic footbridge) across
the road might also be unsafe in
that it would inerease the inci

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

Thursday, December 9, 1976

The State
of the Arts

Beginning when we return for the Winter term, the Ring-
tum Phi will present a special series of feature articles,

It is our project to examine the status of the fine arts at
Washington and Lee. Each article will deal with a specific
facet of artistic expression. University and community spon-
sored programs and courses will be highlighted as well as the
various individual and independent projects of members of
the University community.

The point of such a project? There are several questions we
hope to answer, others we intend to raise, In the first category:
What has been the historical role of the arts at W&L? What
has been the traditional attitude of various groups in the Uni-
versity toward the arts? What impact have artistic endeavors
had on the University? To this end, the Ring-tum Phi will ex-
amine the histories of the arts at W&L, through the records of
various artistic groups as well as our own back issues, which
extend back several decades, fot a glimpse at the University’s
past artistic achievements and the reactions to them.

Close attention will be paid to the current status of the arts
at W&L. What opportunities now exist for persons to express
themselves artistically? Is participation in the arts encouraged,
discouraged, or left to the individual? What physical facilities
are there for the arts? What kinds of courses are offered, and
what specifically are people doing now in and for the arts? The
Ring-tum Phi will talk to the people most closely involved in
the arts: the teachers of course, the sponsors of programs, and,
most important, the individuals who work at the arts because
they believe that the arts are important, the sidemen: actors,
musicians, stage hands and page-turners, and all the others who
devote their spare time or their whole careers to the fine arts.
\nd we'll hear from people who choose to remain outside the
artistic community, and see their reasons for doing so.

This examination of the past and present cannot help but
raise questions about the future. Are there possibilities for the
arts at W&L which have not yet been realized? What projects
are now just beginning? What hope do artists have of encour-
agement and fulfillment here in the future?

One question is particularly interesting: What, i/ anything,
is being done to expand the scope of artistic achievement at
W&L? What plans, if any, are being made to insure that the
arts will flourish and find a home here? | refer specifically to
the current lack of adequate facilities on campus for the fin
arts. A garage and a boiler room make interesting lut hara!
ideal theaters. Serious students of music are left almost entire-
ly to their own devices. Most schools of comparable size, assets
and quality have at least one building devoted entirely to the
fine or performing arts. Yale has one of the most respected re-
pertory groups in the nation,

What is and is not being done? What can be done? Is the
power of commerce so great at W&L that it leaves the arts
languishing in oblivion, General questions, perhaps difficult

ones, but certainly important ones,

Chi Psi: “gentleman’s fraternity”

by BILL THOMSON

Inspired by the success Kappa
Alpha has achieved in reestablish-
ing its Alpha chapter and with the
intention of providing more diver-
sity in the fraternity system, four
students are working to charter
a branch of the Chi Psi social fra-
ternity at Washington and Lee.

“W&L is the kind of institution
that Chi Psi would like to associ-
ate itself with,” said Bill Stanzel,
one of the co-founders. Stanzel, as-
serting that Chi Psi chapter would
fulfill a definite need in the W&L
community, said that the frater-
nity’s goal is diversity in acade-
mics and leadership. Actual work
to establish a chapter has just
started in the past two weeks.
“We don’t want to rush,” Stanzel
said, “and we want to leave the
doors open as much as possible.

Chi Psi national and Stanzel
agreed in September to try to get
the ball rolling. Stanzel contacted
fellow seniors John Palda and
Kirk Ruffin and junior Peter
Keefe with the aim of setting up
“an alternative fraternity.” The
four joined forces as co-founders
and became pledges a week be-
fore Thanksgiving at a ceremony
attended by two officials of Chi
Psi national. Hoping that they will
gain nine or ten pledges during
the Winter term, initiation cere-
monies have been tentatively plan-
ned for February or March at the
Chi Psi house at Chapel Hill.

Nickel €? Diamond Theater

By the end of the year (when
Stanzel, Palda and Ruffin will
graduate), they hope to have 12 to
15 students involved with Chi Psi.
None of the co-founders have had
any previous experience with soc-
ial fraternities, but they have
been getting help from both fac-
ulty members and students. The
English department’s George Ray,
a Chi Psi brother, will be ‘“‘a great
help” according to Stanzel. Dean
John is helping to get the frater-
nity off the ground by offering
names of students who might be
interested in joining Chi Psi, and
Carter Greer, former Kappa Alpha
president, has offered to help in
any way he can.

Stanzel said that at the same
time the national is looking for a
suitable chapter house, the co-
founders are seeking appropriate
members from the W&L student
body.

But wait a minute—there. is
something ~radically different
about this proposed fraternity. Al-
though descriptions of Chi Psi in-
clude the predictable terms (“di-
versity” and “well-rounded” and
so on), one term sets it apart from
other fraternities. “Chi Psi has
been a conservative organization
in the past,” said Stanzel. “‘Al-
though we are not looking for a
specific ‘type’ of member, Chi Psi
is a gentleman’s fraternity.”

A gentleman’s fraternity. Per-
haps that goal is one of the con-

tributing factors to Stanzel’s opi-
nion that, in his eyes, there is no
Chi Psi-type fraternity at Wash-
ington and Lee. No one can deny
that a gentleman’s fraternity bas-
ed on leadership and academics
would be a remarkable innova-
tion.

“Social activities are impor-
tant, but I don’t believe they are
the most important function of a
fraternity,” said Stanzel. “I don’t
want to label it yet,” he said. He
said that as many students as pos-
sible would be interviewed as the
fraternity is starting out, but add-
ed that the co-founders are look-
ing for quality over quantity.

It appears that Chi Psi will have
to select its membership from
three basic groups of independent
students: those who did not parti-
cipate in Rush because they were
not interested in joining a frater-
nity, those who went through
Rush and did not end up joining
any fraternity, and those who
have never seriously considered
joining a fraternity. Stanzel thinks
that “a lot of good people” are
available from these groups. He
says that Chi Psi will have a lot to
offer, and hopes to attract stu-
dents through the fraternity’s
“different images.”

In carefully selecting potential
brothers, the co-founders want to
avoid “setting up blockades”;
since three of the four co-founders
will leave W&L after this year,

features Thurber comedy

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

It is a little known fact around
campus that there are two theater
groups, not one, housed in the
ground level of the Old Main
Building. One is the Boiler Room
Theater, a branch of the W&L
Drama Department, and scene of
this November’s production of
Uncle Vanya. But, there is one

_ other group with a somewhat dif-

ferent character: the Nickel &
Diamond Theater. According to
their prospectus, it is “by design
and philosophy determined to
bring innovative dramatic produc-
tions and educational projects at
a low cost to Lexington and the

surrounding areas, by drawing on -

local talent and support to build
a theater that is truly a commun-
ity effort.” The members explain
their presence as an opportunity
for local residents and students to
present ideas for shows, direct, or
act in them.

The Nickel & Diamond Theater
is a non-profit organiation run by
a Board of Directors, composed of
local residents. Owing to the gen-
erosity of the tenants of the Old
Main Building, office and rehear-
sal space were provided for, on
the mall’s second floor. Aside
from regular dramatic presenta-
tions, Brock Johnson (Executive
Director of the Theater) and Suz-
anne McNeese are offering classes
in acting and in dance, respective-
ly. Other workshops will be creat-
ed as time goes on; for informa-
tion regarding the present classes,
call the theater office at 463-4666.

The theater made its formal de-
but during this past summer, with
a production of the musical, | Dol
| Dol, starring Rob Mish and Penni
Chappell, both noted for their per-
formances in last season's pre-
sentation of 1776, The show was a
great popular success, and ran for
several performances, proving
that an “expensive” show can be
staged with a less than mammoth
budget. This play was staged in
the rear show room of College Inn,
but later shows were planned for
various other locations.

This brings us to the second
show, presently in production,
called An Evening of James Thur-
ber, directed by Alex Bourdrez. (It
will be followed by a dinner theat-
er production of The Fantasticks,
with open auditions in January).
Thurber is another example of
how an ingenious show can result
from a shoestring budget. If enter-
tainment value is drama to you,
this show is a must. The set,
though simple, is effective, the
music by June Morgan is bright
and snappy, and certain sketches
("The Macbeth Murder Mystery”
and “A Friend to Alexander” are
the winners hands-down) make for

hardly a dull moment in the en-
tire evening. The only complaints
from this corner are first, that it
ended all too soon; and second,
the fact that some relatively un-
known sketches were chosen, and

one was left to wonder whatever
happened to Walter Mitty and the
neglected majority of fine Thur-
ber comic creations. But, how can
you really take on the work of a
comic genius in under two hours,
and satisfy all the fierceaffi ciona-
dos of his work? All things con-
sidered, Thurber works extremely
well within its confines. This was
especially due to some isolated
bits of wonderful comedy: Suz-
anne Dieckman and Brock John-
son as the addict to murder-mys-
tery novels and her unfortunate
companion; Phyllis Davis and the
quintessential dumb blonde on a
TV show; Craig Strachan as Thur-
ber telling the story of “The Night
the Bed Fell”; and Hunt Brown
and John Ellis as insane men in

two sketches—one with and one
without an ulterior motive.
Perhaps the most characteristic
remark upon leaving a perform-
ance of Thurber is, “How cute.”
Indeed it is. It is also remarkably
fresh and the pacing is consistent.
One other note: The play runs
through Saturday night, in the
basement of the Old Main Build-
ing, every night at 8 P.M. Reser-
vations are usually necessary,
though some seats may be avail-

Journalism films
draw few viewers

by M. GRAY COLEMAN

Tuesday night, November 30,
was an ordinary night in Lexing-
ton. The Lyric Theatre was cur-
rently featuring the movie Car
Wash, which more than one crit-
ti. has aceused of plumbing new
depths in the ocean of movie com-
edy. Its price per seat: $2.00. Its
audience: very large, with a high
proportion of W&L students.
Meanwhile, in another part of
town, Reid Hall was featuring
Citizen Kane, widely considered
not only the greatest movie ever
made, but one of the most amus-
ing and entertaining. Its price per
seat: nothing. Its audience: under
50 students at the two shows com-
bined...

Outrageous, you might say (or
maybe not, if your father owns
ctock in the studio that put out
Car Wash—lI can think of no other
point of defense). Yet, there is a
possible answer to this puzzle,
aside from the easy-out of saying
that W&L has always been a
happy haven for mischievous mon-
coloids. Journalism department
movies in Reid Hall receive practi-
cally no publicity at all—aside
from insertion on the Master Film
List for each term that is prompt-
ly ripped down in the first week,
and in the Weekly Calendar. This
is why you hay have missed Bus-
ter Keaton in The General, John
Wayne and ‘a cast of thousands’
in Stagecoach, or the inimitable
Orson Welles and his Mercury
Players in Citizen Kane, all of
which sneaked quietly in and out
fo Reid Hall 203, even if you had
wanted to see them.

The SAB movies in DuPont Hall
are a different story. praise be!
They do receive adequate public-
ity, and they are shown on more
than one evening. They also cost a
dollar, but this becomes rather
small in the face of the great
movies the SAB Film Subcommit

tee has rounded up for next term.
which include: Showboat (Jan. 12)
Young Frankstein (Jan. 14-16),
Taxi Driver (Feb. 4-6), Brigadoon
(Feb. 18-20), A Man Called Horse
(March 4-6), Psycho (March 18-20),
and Flight of the Phoenix (March
23). True to tradition, the SAB
usually presents big box-office at-
tractions of recent years. But, if
you're more interested in a film
that remains immortal for two or
three generations, Reid Hall is the
answer—that is, if you can find
out what’s playing there. So, the
next time you're keyed up for a
movie, check the campus movies,
too. Is there really anything that
the Marx Brothers can learn from
Richard Pryor?

Stanzel hopes that their influence
will last at Chi Psi. “If I didn’t, I
wouldn’t be doing it,’ he said.
They have achieved a “fair
amount of progress” so far in or-
ganizing the fraternity and will
focus on gaining members from
the freshman and _ sophomore
classes.

Chi Psi is ‘‘elite” in the fact that
it has only 28 chapters nationally,
Stanzel said. (By comparison, TKE
has over 300 chapters), The W&L
chapter would be No. 29—provid-
ed that the co-founders can come
up with a house, some initiates
and some pledges in the remaind-
er of the year. If these goals are
met, Chi Psi intends to participate
in full scale Rush next year. IFC
recognition will also be necessary,
and the co-founders are hopeful
that Chi Psi will be admitted.

Carter Greer, the current secre-
tary of Kappa Alpha, said that Chi
Psi’s success will depend to a
large degree on next year’s Rush
and the reaction of the student
body. A major force in KA’s come-
back, Greer has gone through the
same situation that the Chi Psi co-
founders are now experiencing.
He said that national affiliation
would help Chi Psi, but added that
Kappa Alpha might have had an
advantage with nine founders
compared with Chi Psi’s four).
KA, after its second year of Rush,
has over 30 members according to
IFC president Alfred Robinson. -

If Chi Psi is able to grow as
quickly as KA, it will be doing
well. And there doesn’t seem to be
any reason why it shouldn’t equal
KA’s success. The co-founders
realized that establishing a new
fraternity would be hard work
but, as Stanzel put it, “It’s a pio-
neering thing to do.”

Chi Psi has traditionally been
an Eastern fraternity (Yale, Cor-
nell), but it also has chapters in
the South (North Carolina, Duke)
and the West (Berkeley, Stanford).
One of the older fraternities, it
was founded in 1841 at Ann Ar-
bor, where the national headquar-
ters are located today. It lists 16,-
000 brothers (15,000 graduates
and 1,000 undergraduates) from
28 chapters. In looking at educa-
tional institutions for new chap-
ters, Chi Psi national considers
the student body as well as the
school’s academic standards, en-
dowment, faculty and alumni ac-
tivity.

To the Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Sir: I solicit your help.

Fun is fun but it can be carried
too far. Changing the letters
around on the marquee is not too
bad but removing the letters is
something else. It breaks up the

vertise the picture.

I have no desire to publish the

Strong performance from the bench helped the Generals to victory over the Lynchburg Hornets last
Thursday. Here, Ardith Collins goes up for two of his eleven points.

Basketball team Swimmers defeat UR

still undefeated

by REID SLAUGHTER

The W&L basketball Generals
kept their undefeated record in-
tact by stopping the Lynchburg
College Hornets 91-87 last Thurs-
day in Doremus Gymnasium.

Although the lead exchanged
hands several times, the Generals
were in control for the better part
of the game. The scoring attack
was led by junior Pat Dennis who
hit an amazing 71% from the floor
while getting 22 points. Co-cap-
tain Bob Flint was close behind
with 19 points, and Ardith Col-
lins and Dave Luenig getting 11
and 10 points, respectively.

One of the bright spots for W&L
was the strong play off the bench.
Coach Verne Canfield freely sub-
stituted throughout the game, and
found he was rarely at less than
full strength, with excellent back-
up playing coming from Ardith
Collins, Bruce Williams and Chris
Larson.

Although they found relatively
equal success with both their fast
break and pattern offenses, the
Generals encountered some diffi-
culties with turnovers, fumbling
the ball away 19 times.

With a 3-0 season record and a
1-0 mark in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference play, the team travels
to Emory and Henry Saturday, re-
turning home against Hampden.
Sydney next Wednesday at 8:00
p.m.

Head coach Bill Stearns called
it, “The greatest victory in my ten
seasons at Washington and Lee.”
And that could be the understate-
ment of the young season. The
final score last Saturday in W&L’s
Doremus Pool: W&L 57, Univer-
sity of Richmond 56.

Being one of five Division I op-
ponents who W&L will swim this
season, the U. of R. was expected
to take charge in the meet against
the Generals. But that wasn’t to
be the case, as W&L’s 400 free-
style relay team of Scott Duff,
John Hudson, Robert Newcomb,
and Tad Van Leer edged out the
Spider’s entry by a fraction of a
second to clinch the 57-56 victory.
The meet went down to the final
event, and matched strength
against strength, but this time
anyway, Washington and Lee
proved just a bit stronger.

't appears that again this sea-
son, the W&L swimming Generals
will be a college division national
power. Four of the W&L team
members are returning All-Ameri-
cans, and six swimmers have al-
ready qualified for the nationals.

The 400 free relay team qualifi-
ed with its’ time of 3:18.9 against
Richmond, as did Keith Romich in
the 20 free style, finishing in
1:47.4. Romich set a school record
in the 200 butterfly with a time
of 2:05.1. John Hudson was also a
double winner against the Spiders
winning the 500 and 1000 free-
style, as well as being a member of
the winning relay.

The victory over the U. of R.
was a team effort from start to
finish. Chip Hoke finished second
in the 100 free and 200 1. M., and
anchored the final relay, Pete
Meem won the 200 breaststroke,
Drew Pillsbury was second in the
200 backstroke, Gordon Ross took
second in the 3 meter diving and
third in the 1 meter diving, and
Scott Duff won the 50 free and
took third in the 100 free, as well
as leading off the final relay.

Three wrestlers place

by KEVIN McFADDEN

Three wrestlers from W&L plac-
ed in the first annual Washington
and Lee Invitational Tournament.

For W&L at 158 Ibs., senior cap-
tain, Jim Crytzer, won three
matches on his way to W&L’s only
first place showing.

Crytzer pinned his first man
from Liberty Baptist; decisioned
his second match against a Key-
det, 40; and superior decisioned
the third in the 18-7 finale with a
matman from York.

For his efforts, Crytzer was vot-
ed the tournament’s Most Valu-
able Wrestler.

Sophomore Ed Rogers was the
only wrestler from W&L to make
it to the finals, winning matches
against York and Maryville. He
was defeated in the finals in a
close 42 match against a George
Mason wrestler.

The only other W&L wrestler to
place was freshman Ray Gross,
placing third.

Liberty Baptist won the tourna-
ment capturing 6314 points. Fol-
lowing L.B.C. were: York, 61;
VM!, 60 3/4; Maryville, 41%;
W&L, 31: Howard, 29%; Madison,
28; and George Mason, 20%.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

Football: a winning season

J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals completed the 1976 season
with a 5-5 record, the best record
a Generals’ football team has man-
aged since 1967. The Generals in
finishing 4th in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference (Randolph-
Macon was Ist) placed 4 players
on the Ist team all-conference,
and 7 men on the 2nd team.

The whole of W&L should be
proud of its 1976 football team.
These young men worked hard to
obtain their 5-5 mark, and they
deserve to hold their heads high.
On the road to this fine season, 11
players gained distinction for
themselves in the ODAC,

Tony Perry, who holds all pass
receiving records at W&L, was
named ODAC Player of The Year.
Steve DiBiagio was a unanimous
choice at offensive guard. Jack
Reeves ended his four year career
with a first team selection at de-
fensive tackle. Jack Norberg, who
led the conference in intercep-
tions, was W&L’s fourth pick on
the first team.

The Generals placed on the sec-
ond team: end Rick Fink, line-
backers Jeff Slatcoff and Carl Fol-
cik, and defensive backs Don
Crossly and Mark Healy. From the
offense, Ray Scott and center
Mark Duncan were chosen. This
was quite an honor for Duncan,
who bounced back this season
from a couple of knee operations
he had last year.

Though we finished with a good
year, winning 4 out of the last 5
games, we still have many areas
that need improvement. W&L’s op-
ponents beat us statistically in
every category-total offense, total
defense, etc... . W&L did finish
2nd in passing offense and rush-
ing defense in the ODAC, but 4th
(out of 5 teams) in rushing offense
and passing defense.

Mary’s College.

No away events.

The offensive line, lacking size
and experience, could not grind
out yardage on the ground. The
offense relied mainly on quarter-
back Ted Hissey’s arm to obtain
the necessary yardage. The Gen-
erals best game offensively was
against Bridgewater.

The defensive backfield (main-
ly through inexperience and poor
positioning) allowed opposing
teams’ quarterbacks to throw suc-
cessfully on them game after
game. Though never achieving
preseason expectations, the defen-
sive backfield did show consistent
improvement from game to game.

The defensive line held the de-
fense together as opposing teams
found it hard to gain ground yard-
age on W&L’s small but quick line
and powerful linebackers. The de-
fense’s best game was probably in
the 7-3 upset against conference
champion, Randolph-Macon.

Hissey finished the season as the
ODAC’s leading quarterback. Af-
ter a slow start, he showed mark-
ed improvement throughout the
season. Though performing ade-
quately for the Generals, he com-
pleted les than 50% of his passes
and led the ODAC in interceptions
(14). If he can improve in these
two areas, and build more confi-
dence in his play calling, the Gen-

erals should have a fine quarter-
back for next season.

Hissey had as his two main re-
ceivers, Rich Wiles and Tony
Perry. Wiles led the team in total
receptions and displayed sure
hands throughout the entire year.
Perry, on the other hand, seemed
to drop more passes than he
caught. Opposing teams were cov-
ering him more effectively than
in the past, and consequently,
Perry’s receptions suffered. He
did gain form late in the season
though, and finished one recep-
tion behind Wiles.

Ray Scott showed much dm-
provement over his first two sea-
sons as he led the Generals in
rushing. The appearance of fresh-
man running back, Stew Atkinson
was an added spark to W&L’s run-
ning attack. If the offensive line
becomes stronger and quicker for
next season, and if Buck Leslie
utilizes Atkinson’s straight ahead
toughness, and Scott’s outside
quickness—then W&L could have
two backs averaging over 4 yards
per carry, which is what they need
to have a successful running at-
tack.

The team was plagued with
many injuries, which undoubtedly
hurt them considerably. Offensive

Goddard vs. SAE

(Continued from page 1)

Robinson said he had consulted
Dean Lewis G. John on the matter
and that John advised against
looking into it.

At Robinson’s request, the E. C.
voted 6-5 with Sandy Stradtman
abstaining not to record the dis-
cussion in the official minutes of
the meeting.

Kelly later said ‘“‘We're going to
pretend it (the discussion) never
happened.”

Earlier, the E.C. had voted to
uphold a fine imposed by the Cold
Check Committee. Goddard said
then he thought the University
had no business prying into a stu-
dent’s checkbook, as it was the
student’s own business.

Bob Couch, chairman of the
Cold Check Committee, answered
that the committee was necessary
in order to maintain credibility
with Lexington merchants.

Irwin was a member of the vol-
unteer ambulance unit which
served in France from 1917 to

1919. The letters included in the
newly published volume were
written to his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. W. P. Irwin of Lexington, and
to his brothers and sisters. They

des-ribe his first days of training .

in Pennsvivania, his trip to Eur-
ope on a troop ship, a stopover in
southern England, and his combat
experiences on the battlefields of
France.

Many of the letters were, writ-
ten amidst gun and cannon fire,
aecording to Dr. Turner, and pre-
sent vivid pictures both of life in
the battle zones and of the char-
acter of his fellow ambulance-unit
volunteers, mostly W&L students
like Irwin himself.

Dr. Turner’s previous three
books in the current series are 7h
Medic Forty-Niner,” the letters of
Dr. Reuben Knox; “An Old Field
Schoolteacher,” the diary of Jere-
miah C. Harris; and the diaries
and letters of Capt. Greenlee
Davidson during the Civil War.

WA&L gets new painting

A new painting by the noted
American artist Ray Prohaska has
been added to the permanent col-
lection of W&L where he taught
for six years.

Prohaska painted the work es-
pecially for W&L, and put the fin-
ishing touches on the canvas in
the room in which it now hangs—
the Fairfax Lounge of W&L’s
Early-Fielding Student Center.
The abstract painting was com-
missioned for W&L by a group of
Prohaska’s friends and former
students.

A past president of the Ameri-
can Society of Illustrators, Pro-
haska was artist-in-residence at
W&L from 1963 to 1969. After
leaving W&L, he went to Wake
Forest University, where he held
a similar post in the art depart-
ment headed by Dr. Sterling M.
Boyd, also a former W&L art pro-
fessor.

Prohaska is a naturalized
American citizen who was born in
Yugoslavia. He studied at the Cal-
ifornia Schoo! of Fine Arts in San
Francisco. His paintings have
shown in the National Academy,
the Pennsylvania Academy, the
Whitney, and other leading Ameri-
can galleries. Prohaska illustra-
tions have appeared in most of the
nation’s leading magazines as
well, including Good Housekeep-
ing, the Saturday Evening Post,
Esquire, Holiday and others.

Prohaska now lives in Bridge-
hampton, N. Y.

guards, Sal Abbruzzese and Bob
Williams, were out most of the
season, along with tight end, Bob
S-ezecinski; running back, Keith
Steele; punter, Phil Bailey; and
probably the most costly, place-
ki ker, Dan Thompson. Thompson,
with a painful pulled hamstring
musele, was unable to regain the
powerful kick in his leg until late
in the season. That, along with the
Generals lack of backup kicker,
and the coaches’ unwillingness to
develop one, considerably hurt
W&L’s field goal attack.

Though the Generals were not a
blue chip statistical team, they did
what past teams in recent years
‘ouldn’t do—win games. The main
cifferenee between this team and
past teams was the amount of
umty and team spirit that existed
on this team. Each member was
willing to sacrifice his social life
and devote himse!f entirely to the
p-ogram—and it ‘paid off.

élrat the team did lack, how-
evov, Was tne suport of its stu-
den, body. No other student bedy
in the country will sit sullen in
the stands when their team is in-
side the opponent’s 10 yard line,
except for Washingion and Lee’s.
A “charge” or a couple of rah rahs
can sometimes push a team over
ihe gual line.

Having the Homecoming Dance
after the game instead of before
the game so the football players
could attend, wouldn’t hurt. A Sat-
urday afternoon is not only a
good time to get totally wasted,
but is also an excellent time to
exhibit some of the school spirit
that was supposed to have been
instilled in us way back at the
time of Natural Bridge.

The 1976 team was a young
team, and is graduating only sev-
en seniors. If the enthusiasm that
was evident in this year’s team,
carries over to next year’s team;
added to the experience gained
from this season, the Generals
should have a big year. Next year,
let’s heip them win games.
