Tyranny proposed for students

Ind. exam system in jeapordy

On Monday April 25th the
faculty Executive Committee
met and discussed a proposal by
Dr. Cook, head of the ac-
counting department, to
eliminate independent exams.
On Monday, May 2nd, this
committee will submit its
recommendation to the entire
faculty for a vote. According to

Generals dominate

Wahoos

Prepare for Maryland

In this Saturday’s ‘“‘Game of
the Year,” never will the W&L
Generals be more prepared.
Physically all is _ well,
psychologically all are deter-
mined, and emotionally all
know that the opportunity is
now. At 2:00 p.m..on. W&L’s
Wilson Field, it’s the second

ranked and _ undefeated
University of Maryland
Terrapins (6-0) against the
sixth ranked and_ 8-2

Washington and Lee Generals.

W&L has incentive galore
going for them in Saturday’s
battle. The team, after early
losses to Navy and Hofstra, has
rebounded to win four in a row,
all in convincing fashion, in-
cluding the most recent, a 13-10
win over arch-rival Virginia
last Saturday. In seventeen
meetings between the Terps
and Generals, W&L_ has
managed to win but once, that
being a 9-8 come from behind
win in 1950. Since then, the
closest a W&L team has come to
beating Maryland was last
season when the stickmen
dropped a 16-14 decision.

Not only will W&L be fighting
to end a 14 game dominance,
but the All-American goalie who

engineered that lone 9-8
triumph in 1950, Bill Clements
and his wife Jane will be in
attendance on Saturday. For
good reason, of course — their
son Bob is a 5-11 freshman
goalie and the teams’ leading
faceoff specialist. Bob’s day has
fond memories of _ that
memorable day back in ’50.
W&L’s first first-team All-
American lacrosse player
recalls that game. ‘‘Maryland
coach Jack Faber was fairly
confident that his team would
beat us as evidenced by the fact
that he was correcting his
biology papers during the first
half. He had little reason to
worry as the Terps led 5-4, and
all was according to schedule
after two quarters. We came on
to tie the score at eight with one
quarter to go. With three
minutes left to play, senior Tom
Tongue put us on top 9-8.
Maryland won the ensuing
faceoff, but a check got us the
ball and we froze it for the last
two and a half minutes.”’
Quoting a W&L athletic
release from that season, ‘Bill
Clements was credited with
over 20 saves against Maryland,

(continued on page 4)

Executive Committee would
have to find an alternative
exam schedule.

To the distress of many
students, the third possibility
cannot be ruled out. According
to Dr. Cook, his proposal is not
without justification. He em-
phasizes that he has nothing
personal against independent
exams. Yet at the same time he
also points out that, “the in-
dependent exam _ schedule
places a tremendous strain on
the Honor System in that it
provides the student greater
opportunities to cheat. Fur-
thermore it may lead to a subtle
erosion of the overall Honor
System. For example if a
student is willing to cheat on his
final exams he may be en-
couraged to cheat on his earlier
tests and quizes. And if it comes
to that...if it comes down to a
choice between independent
exams and the Honor System, I
will choose the Honor System.

Law school

Chains loosened in ’69

by Randy Smith

Nineteen sixty-nine was a
turbulent year on college
campuses across the nation.
Rules were revised as ad-
ministrators bent to student
pressure. Washington and Lee,
although a little late to join the
student activism trend, also
experienced important
changes.

In October, W&L students
participated in a nationwide
moratorium against the Viet-
nam War. The faculty Student
Affairs Committee allowed a
major concession in fraternity
regulations : ‘‘Female guests
may be allowed on the upper
floors of the fraternity houses
between the hours of 5 p.m. on
Friday and 12 midnight Sunday,
with the understanding that
overnight visitations are
prohibited.’”’ And the issue of

Lewis Hall, the building
which houses the Law School at
Washington and Lee, will be
formally dedicated on Satur-
day, May 7, at 11:30 a.m.
Construction began on the site
in 1973, and the building went
into use in the fall of 1976. It
replaced Tucker Hall as the

home of the law school.
Dedication activities will
begin on Friday, May 6, with
tours of the new construction

available throughout. the af-
ternoon. At 3 p.m., the finals of
the Burk Moot Court com-
petition will be held in the Moot
Court room.

There will be several exhibits
and displays during dedication
day. The art work of Louise

artist whose paintings, now
owned by Washington and Lee,
had their national premiere last
autumn in Washington, D. C.,

Goldwater here May 12

by Bill Kerr

Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, will
address the W&L community in
Lee Chapel on May 12 at 8 p.m.
This speech will be co-
sponsored by the W&L Young
Republicans and Contact.

Goldwater, R-Ariz., is making
his second appearance at W&L,
the first being in 1969.

In 1964, W&L_ students
predicted Goldwater as their
choice for president during that
year’s Mock Republican
Convention.

Goldwater has been a leading
force in the Republican Party
for nearly 30 years. Goldwater
has been a member of the U. S.
Senate since 1953 and is credited
with making the Arizona GOP

the state’s dominant political
force for over 20 years. This was
best illustrated by his 1952
Senate victory which then
ousted Senate Majority leader
Ernest MacFarland.

In the Senate, Goldwater
serves as the ranking member
of the Aeronautical and Space
Science Committee. He also is
serving on the Armed Services
Committee and the select
Committee on Intelligence
Operations. However, he is
better known for his consistent
conservative - liberatarian
philosophy. He received a 100
rating from the American
Conservation Union and raised
eyebrows when he fought
against both the draft and the

independant exams came
before the students and faculty.

On December 10th, in a
referendum vote, the student
body overwhelmingly approved
the concept of an independant
examination schedule. Almost
800 students voted in favor of
the proposal, with only 35
dissenting votes.

The faculty discussed the
issue, weighing the pros and
cons of various recom-
mendations for a viable plan.
The primary objection to an’
independant exam schedule
was that it might prove taxing
on the Honor’ System.
Nonetheless, a system for in-
dependant exams, taken on a
day of the student’s choosing,
was adopted, to take effect
during the next academic year.

Now, seven years after the
implementation of independant
examinations, the system is
under what appears to be its
toughest challenge yet, because
as the faculty gives, the faculty
can also take away. At last
Monday’s faculty meeting, a
motion was presented to repeal
the independant exam schedule,
the first such motion since its
inception.

One administration source
said that the motion was an
expression of doubts that had
been building in the minds of
some of the faculty for ‘‘quite

New Phi

editor chosen

by Bob Lutz

J. Michael Gallagher has
been elected editor-in-chief of
the Ring-tum Phi for the 1977-78
academic year.

Gallagher’s election came
Monday, April 25 at a special
meeting of the University
Publications Board.

Previously, the Board had
elected Joe Fitzgerald to the
post but was obligated to reopen
applications for the position
after Fitzgerald decided to
withdraw from the University.

Gallagher, a rising junior,
brings limited experience to the
job, having served as Sports
Editor only since midway
through the Fall term, and with
no other journalistic ex-
perience. He is known primarily
as a sports activist and en-
thusiast.

His election is a clear case of
fraud, blackmail and bribery.
2 THE RING-TUM PHI

E.C. tries to laugh problems away

by Lee Howard

“The E. C. in the spring,”
commented Sandy Stradtman
while shaking his head.

Anyone who had never at-
tended an Executive Committee
meeting before would not have
believed that the persons joking
and clowning around at the long
horseshoe desk were members
of the most important student
government organization on
campus.

The only issue at Monday’s
meeting that was discussed
Straight-faced was what the
faculty is going to do about
independent exams. Stradtman,
E. C. vice president, said that
he had recommended at the
weekly faculty meeting earlier
in the day that independent
exams be kept for ‘‘at least one
more year.”’

Stradtman said some of the
faculty’s feelings against in-
dependent exams “‘aren’t un-
founded.’’ Although he _per-
sonally favors independent
exams Stradtman said there is
“a lot of talking going on”
during finals week. He also said
he believes there is a reluctance
to turn someone in for an honor
violation.

Stradtman said that if the
faculty give students another
year before deciding on the
independent exam issue the E.
C. should do all it can to inform
students on the honor system
through the Ring-tum Phi,
posters, freshman orientation

at Natural Bridge and dorm
councilors.

The independent exam issue
will be resolved, at least for
now, at this week’s faculty
meeting, said Stradtman. The
faculty requested that Jim
Underhill, next year’s E. C.
president, and Tom Hunter, the
present E. C. president, be at
that meeting, according to
Stradtman.

The next issue brought up was
the year-end Executive Com-
mittee party. The E. C. had to
decide when it should be held
and how much money should be
appropriated for it.

‘“‘Just appropriate $300-$400
and return what we don’t need,”
suggested a smiling Walt
Kelley, senior E. C.
representative.

“Is this stag?’’ asked George
Griffin, next year’s E. C. vice
president.

‘‘What are we going to eat?”
asked someone else.

‘Lobster neuberg, sirloin...”
said Kelley.

‘“‘Are we going to have favors
at this party,’ asked senior
Paul Larkin, E. C. represen-
tative.

‘‘We have favors that will do
you favors,”’ said Griffin in his
best Groucho Marx imitation.

Finally, someone proposed
that the E. C. appropriate $250
for the party and that it be held
Tuesday.

‘All in favor say ‘aye.’ All
opposed, ‘nay.’ The ayes have

Former ass’t attorney

general to speak

Herbert Wechsler, a leading
Constitutional law scholar and
former assistant United States
attorney general, will deliver
the annual John Randolph
Tucker lecture in law at
Washington and Lee University
May 7.

Wechsler’s topic will be “‘The
Appellate Jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court: Reflections on
the Law and the Logistics of
Direct Reviews.”’ The address
will take place at 10:30 a.m. in
the Moot Court Room of Lewis
Hall.

The Tucker lecturer is
currently Harlan Fiske Stone
professor of law at Columbia
University. His professorship is
named for the late Supreme
Court justice for whom he was
law secretary in 1932-33.

Wechsler was __ special
assistant to the Attorney
General from 1940 to 1944, and
was assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Justice
Department’s war division
from 1944 to 1946. During that
latter period he was also
technical advisor to the
American members of the
International Military Tribune.

His major books include ‘‘The
Nationalization of Civil
Liberties and Civil Rights’ and
“Principles, Politics and
Fundamental Law.’’ He is also
co-author of ‘‘The Federal
Courts and the
System” and “Criminal Law
and its Administration.”

Federal —

His topic, the Supreme
Court’s direct review
procedures, will be of special
interest to at least one member
of his audience — Supreme
Court Justice Lewis F. Powell
Jr., a W&L graduate and
himself a former Tucker lec-
turer (1966). Powell will be on
campus that weekend for the
law school dedication
ceremonies and for the regular
spring meeting of the W&L
board of trustees, of which he is
a member.

Child Abuse-

topic of lecture

Dr. Willard Gaylin will lec-
ture at Washington and Lee
University Friday on the
subject “Who Speaks for the
Helpless Child?”’

Gaylin, co-founder and
president of the Institute of
Society, Ethics and the Life
Sciences, will speak in room 305
of Parmly Hall at 8 p.m. April
29. The public is invited to at-
tend.

The Institute, located in
Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y., was
founded in 1969 and is one of two
major centers in the country for
the study of contemporary
social problems.

Gaylin is also a teacher —

it,” said Larkin. Indeed, no
formal vote was taken on the
matter, although Neil Pentifallo
said after the meeting, ‘I’m on
the record as paying my own
way. I’m adamantly opposed”’
to the E. C. appropriating
money for its own party.

The only other action the E. C.
took during the half-hour
meeting was to announce the
University Council candidates
and to impose a $7.50 spending
limit and a poster limit of 25.
The election will be held
Monday.

The candidates for U. C. will
be: sophomores — Car] Carbzzi,
Marc Birenbaum, Buff Martin,
Deekeesler; seniors — Peter C.
Reefe, Will Clemens, John F.
Sacco, Ryland Owen.

When someone asked what
would happen in the case of a
tie, Radar Davis, E. C.
secretary, said ‘‘We’ll flip a
coin’”’ to find out who wins. It
was that kind of a meeting.

SAB

appointments

announced

Doug Jackson and Charlie
Hulfish have been appointed co-
chairmen of the Student Ac-
tivities Board for the 1977-78
school-year. Tom McCarthy
was named secretary of the

ROTC to invade
Fredericksburg

by Reid Slaughter

Little did you know that even
as you read this, extensive
plans are being made for a
large scale Army manuever in
our area.

It is called FTX (meaning
Field Training Exercise) and is
taking place outside
Fredericksburg, Virginia this
weekend as part of the W&L
ROTC program. Approximately
fifty ROTC students will take
part in the exercise, designed
initially to promote leadership
training and the ability to work

_ Closely with others.

This particular event differs
from previous FTX’s in that it
involves both National Guards-
men and Army Green Beret.
The plan is for the W&L ROTC
to act as the enemy
(presumably Communist, for
some reason) and try to wipe
out a group of sixty ‘‘trapped ”’
National Guardsmen while the
Special Forces Green Beret
attempts to rescue the soldiers.
The manuever lasts about 2%
days, ending Sunday afternoon.

Maj. Wolf D. Kutter and Sgm.
Otis Wright have worked out
detailed plans, but they will be

“ carried out by two student

ROTC leaders Mike Cleary and
Dorman Walker. The plans
include the use of helicopters,
reconnaissance aircraft, and a
large portion of jeeps and
trucks. ‘“‘We were invited to
take part in these manuevers
primarily because we are a
more enthusiastic enemy than
other Reserve units’’ stated
Maj. Kutter, who went on to
point out that the exercises
were of invaluable experience
for those ROTC students who
are preparing to go through a
five week advance training
camp at Ft. Bragg between
their junior and senior years.

There have been two previous
FTX’s this year, the first

  

*Lacrosse Ties

* Madras Belts

coming during the first
weekend in October. This was
primarily for freshmen, and
included an introduction into
basic field manuevers, As one
frosh ROTC student remarked,
“Tt really made you appreciate
what goes into the training and
how hard it is to operate when
there is shooting going on all
around you. Even though the
bullets weren’t real, it was kind
of scary.”

The second FTX was called
“GATOR SWAMP ONE”, and
took place around the Maury
River behind the new law
school. Although primarily for
juniors, all class levels were
allowed to take part. The two-
day exercise included
patrolling, raiding and more
individual activity, while the
second day was devoted to a
small scale war between two
“‘armies’’, with both sides going
on the attack and falling back
on defense.

In general, the purpose of
FTX is to allow the students to
use some of their knowledge
acquired in the classroom
(which is where the bulk of the
learning in the ROTC program
takes place) to use in the field.
‘“‘What it comes down to,” says
Kutter, “‘is the ability to think
on your feet and the ability to
direct others.’

Art under the sky

Student arts fair and ‘‘one o'clock theatre’’

by Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The months of April and May
will see an unprecedented
flurry of activity on the lawns of
W&L. The dogs will just have to
move over; cutlure, in the form
of outdoor art and theater
productions, has moved in.

In the forefront of this activity
is the first Washington and Lee
Student Arts Fair, scheduled for
Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday — May 18-20. A group of
students, aided by the fine arts
faculty, recently appeared
before the E. C. and received
$500 to budget the operation.

“The purpose of this fair,”
said Dan Scott, a main coor-
dinator of the project, ‘‘is to
focus everyone’s attention on
what’s happening in the arts —
to let everyone see it for
themselves.’’ And what better

way, than to stage all the
productions on the front lawn
and exterior grounds of Lee
Chapel. Under the auspices of
the Washington and Lee ad-
ministration, three days of
student shows and exhibits will
be presented. Featured among
them will be a three day exhibit
of student photography,
painting, sculpture and
graphics of the Colonnade. In
addition, student musical
groups (such as the Cosmic
Cowboys) will be performing on
other areas of the front campus.

The first day’s activities will
be centered around activities
for area children, who will be
brought on campus to paint a
huge canvas, model in clay and
be filmed on videotape and then
allowed to view themselves. All
of this will climax at 3 p.m. ina
performance of the Rockbridge

Children’s Theater’s Annual
Show, June Morgan’s Circus
Magic. The musical will be
performed in the new Lee
Chapel courtyard and is the
story of Arnold, the Enchanted
Lion (played by student Hunt
Brown), and the efforts of a
young boy and girl to break the
spell cast on him by an evil
magician (Tab Brown). Other
familiar Theatre faces par-
ticipating include John
Hollinger, Phyllis Davis, Brock
Johnson, and Hugh Robinson.
The cast of 30 is composed of
ages 6 through 23, and will be
performed for an audience from
local orphanages, schools, and
those in the Big Brother
program.

Drama-related events will
take up much of the second day,
full of one-man shows and mime
productions. The final day will

exhibition of what the children
have created, another mime

are invited to attend, stroll

at no cost.

IMPORTANT! There is one
thing that the students of W&L
must do if the fair is to succeed.
And that is to con-
tribute your creations — there
is hereby announced a plea and
call for drawings, paintings,
graphics, cartoons, sculpture,
literary works, dramatic and
musical compositions. They will
be performed, published,
exhibited, etc. without
screening — now this has to be
one of the greatest chances for
exposure for any budding artist,
and a good way to assure the
success of a worthwhile project.

For nights, there are plans
underway for student readings
of their literary works and
performances of their original
music. But contributions are
needed now! Please turn them
in to the art studio, duPont 107,
or call the Fine Arts Secretary
for more details.

some from right in front that
were close to incredible.’’
Clements called that afternoon,
“the greatest game in my life.”
That contest was the first time a
so-called ‘‘nobody” had beaten
a ‘‘somebody” in collegiate
lacrosse. Twnety-seven years
later, & W&L diehards are
hoping that history can repeat
itself.

W&L junior goalie Charlie
Brown has turned in three
outstanding games in a row,
and is playing the best lacrosse
in his three year career.
Because of this, Bob Clements
will probably see most of his
playing time in the faceoff area,
but as far as coach Jack Em-
mer is concerned, that’s just
fine. ‘‘We had a dismal start
against U. Va. in the faceoff
area, but Clements came on and
had a great afternoon. He won
15 of 22 on the day.’’ On the
year, the 1976 graduate of St.
Paul’s has won 58 per cent of his
faceoffs to lead W&L.

The win over U. Va. was
W&L’s fifth straight over the
Cavaliers, but Emmer notes,
‘Regardless of the streak, it
still feels good to do it again.
There is no way we'll ever take
this one for granted.’’ W&L’s all
sophomore attach rose to the
occasion against the Wahoos,
combining for nine goals and six
assists. Cannon Award winner
Chris Kearney led the team
with four scores, while Jeff
Fritz had a 3-3 afternoon. Brown
was credited with 21 saves, and
delighted the fans with his of-
fensive spurts. W&L led 12-4

2:44 into the fourth quarter.

“We have to play our game
against Maryland,’’ says
Emmer, ‘‘We’re an explosive
team, and a team that has our
best play in front of us.”
Maryland is coming off a 16-13
win over the Naval Academy.
This game is W&L’s final
contest against a team ranked
in the USILA’s top five. The
Generals are sixth this week,
the same spot they opened the
year in. As Emmer said, ‘Our
four final games are all big
ones, but things are looking up
for the tournament.”

Before that however, it’s the
Terps on Saturday, and if the
weather holds up, the crowd
could better the Virginia game
attendance of 6,000.

Netmen Run Away With Title

Bussard Named Coach-of-the- Y ear

by Jim Barnes

It’s dynasty time for the
Washington and Lee _ tennis
team in the ODAC. While some
skeptics may suggest that my
observation may be a bit
premature, I simply point to the
results of the ODAC cham-
pionship held at W&L last week.
The team comprised of four
freshmen, one junior, and one
senior, captured with
astonishing ease all six singles
championships and all three
doubles championships.

Ben Johns, player-of-the-year
in the ODAC, lost only ten
games in three matches as he
played to perfection in winning
the number one singles
championship. But at number
two, Stewart Jackson tried
harder and only dropped nine
games in a romp in his number
two singles bracket. Captain
Ken Voelker continued his
winning ways and without
loosing a set won the number
three singles championship
round. Number four singles
player Dee Keesler, who had
previously lost only five games
in two matches, was forced into

The Generals’s golf team is
looking forward to a possible
bid to the Division III National
Tournament at Kenyon College
in Gambier, Ohio on May 24
through the 27th. The in-
vitations will be given by mid-
May. Since the team won the
ODAC Championship and has a
5-1 record in dual matches the
chances of getting an invitation
look promising. Tomorrow the
Generals take on Emory and
Henry at home. This dual match
and the remaining five matches
willl be crucial in the General’s
quest for a shot at the Division
III National Title.

The major reason for thinking
about the Nationals is the torrid
second 18 holes that clinched
victory in ODAC Cham-
pionships held Monday, April
18th. The Generals were leading
co-favorites Hampden-Sydney

Track Team Loses

Swinging back into action last
week, the Generals found
themselves on the short end of a
77-76 score with OCAC rival
Lynchburg College. More
importantly, W&L will have a
chance to redeem themselves

this Saturday at Bridgewater in
the First Annual ODAC Track
and Field Championships. The
Generals finish could be crucial
in determining the final overall
supremacy champion in the

conference. Bridgewater,
Lynchburg and W&L should
fight it out for the title, with
EMC as the darkhorse.

The highlight of the Lyn-
chburg meet was senior Mike
Burns performance in the three
mile. Burns ran a school record
breaking 14:54.2 and he now has
both the two mile and three mile
records to his credit. He is a
1973 graduate of Martinsbille
High in Martinsville, Va.

a three set match for the
championship. He lost the first
set 4-6 to Hampden-Sydney’s
Dave Summerlin _ before
zooming to victory 6-1, 6-3 in the
second and third sets. Hamp-
den-Sydney again tripped W&L
when John Mansfield took the
first four games from Richard
Makepeace in the first set of
their championship match. The
Stalled Makepeace then ripped
off six straight games for the
first set and won the second set
7-5. David Constine found little
trouble in winning the number
six championship round
disposing of the opposition
without dropping a set in the
process.

In doubles the Generals
dominated the play as they did
in singles. The number three
team of Keesler and Makepeace
lost a mere six games in their
three match romp. Ken Voelker
and Pat Norris glided to victory
(with what is a clinch by this
time) without dropping a set in
the number two doubles
championship round. The
number one team of Johns and
Jackson struggled with Quarles

-

and Lynchbury by only 5 and 7
strokes respectively after the
first 18 holes. At that point the
W&L linkmen burned the other
two teams in the second 18 holes
and finished the tournament
leading runner-up Lynchburg
by 20 strokes and third place
Hampden-Sydney by 24 strokes.
Also participating were Ran-
dolph-Macon, Bridgewater,
Roanoke, and Emory and
Henry.

W&L’s big victory assured the
Generals the lion’s share of
post-season honors. Leading the
way was sophomore Dave
Leunig who had the best two
round socres (148) and the only
par round of the tournament
(71). Because of this excellent
performance, Dave was named
ODAC Player of the Year. W&L

also had the second place
finisher in the tournament in
junior team captain Jerry

and Summerlin of Hampden-
Sydney before triumphing 6-1, 6-
7 (4-5), 7-5.

Coach Dennis Bussard also
got into the winner’s circle
being named the ODAC coach-
of-the-year. However, Bussard
is quick to point out that,
“Senior Ken Voelker and junior
Ben Johns have provided a
great deal of leadership and
experience in helping the fresh-
men play to their potential.”’
One telltale of how successful
the tennis season will be is how
the Generals play in the half
dozen upcoming matches
against far stronger opponents
than those of the ODAC. A .500
or better season will be a major
accomplishment for a team that
is carrying four freshmen in the
starting lineup. Once again in
the final standings W&L ran
away with the ODAC cham-
pionship with 27 points,
distantly followed by Hampden-
Sydney, 14, Emory and Henry,
11, Randolph-Macon, 6,
Bridgewater, 4, Eastern
Mennonite, 1, Roanoke, 0. and
Lynchburg, 0.

To Nationals?

Maatman who shot a solid 150 to
be named to the All-Conference
Team. Coach Leslie praised
Jerry for playing well under
pressure from circumstances
unrelated to golf. Also named to
the All-Conference Team were
Gary Barousse and Terry
Shadrick by virtue of their 153
totals. Barousse, a freshman,
has surprised many with his
consistently good play this year.
Shadrick, a junior, helped lead
the Generals second round
charge with a one-over-par 72,
the second best round of the
tournament. Also aiding the
cause was sophomore Andy
Fitzgerald whose _ scores
counted in both rounds. Coach
Leslie praised Andy for
bouncing back strongly this
season after ‘‘a tough start.”
Finally Coach Leslie was
named Coach of the Year for his
part in the W&L triumph.

Baseball Team
Drops Two

by Jerry Harris

You have heard about the
vicious circle in sociology,
polites, economics and various
other academic areas. Now add
a new type of vicious circle —
that of the Washington and Lee
baseball team. After dropping
two games in four outings last
week, head mentor Joe Lyles
was meaning over the effects of
just such a cycle.
such a cycle.

On Saturday the Generals
were defeated by visiting
Emory & Henry 5-0 in the first
game of a doubleheader while
battling to an unusual 6-6 tie at
the end of 13 innings in the
nightcap. Tuesday W&L
travelled to Eastern Mennonite,
winning 17-4 and losing 3-1. This
gave the batmen a 4-15-1 mark
for the season.

relatively tough qualifying time
of sub-3 hours (that’s equivalent
to running 26 miles at better
than 7 minutes per mile).
Despite this fact 3100
marathoners came to Boston
April 19 for the annual affair.

It was a great day for watch-

for running. The temperature
was in the upper 70’s to about 80

The victory was especially
sweet for the team since they
had not been favored to win. A
2% week layoff hurt the team in
the State Tournament (held
April 8th, 9th and 10th) although
they finished strongly to place

crowd watching the race as in
excess of 1 million. They must
have been right. From the time
the gun went off until the finish
line in downtown Boston, the
course was lined with spec-
tators 10 feet deep on each side.
The start was slow; it took me 4
minutes just to get across the
starting line after the gun. You
spend the first few miles
hemmed in by other runners.
With very little running room at
first, you later have a whole two
lane road to run on.

For the last 15 miles however,
the crowds got almost un-
controllable — hemming us into
a corridor 5-10 feet wide. You
are almost completely en-
veloped by a screaming crowd
exhorting you onward with
clenched fists, sliced oranges,

‘cups of water, etc.. It borders
between utter exhilaration and
terror! One of the most exciting
parts of the course is alongside
the Wellesley campus — the
whole student body was out in
force cheering madly for each
woman runner and politely
applauding the men.

The ending was amazing. You
round a bend and enter a square
in which 100,000 people are
screaming for you (sort of like a

well in the victory over Eastern
Mennonite. Buzby and
Bonaventure both connected for
home runs against EM to ac-
count for two of the team’s 15
hits. Danny Westbrook
recorded the victory in a strong
pitching performance. But, as
Lyles pointed out, such efforts
have been sporadic so far this
season.

Contrary to most losing
teams, the Generals have not
been hurt by a lack of talent,
poor pitching or inexperience.
Instead, it is the little things like
double plays and back-t-back
hits that have plagued W&L
thus far.

Lyles said, “Our main cause
of so many losses has been
hitting. We’re getting the hits
but they are spaced out.”
Because of this, he noted, extra
pressure has been put on the
relatively young pitching staff
of the Generals.

Meanwhile, the lack of runs
has pressured the defense to
play tight, which causes a lot of
errors. The errors: make the
pitcher afraid to throw strikes
and after a while you have a
complete breakdown of the
team. Add to this some injuries,
sickness of key players and a
break of 2 days in the middle of
the season with no playing and
you have a picture of misery.

But the team has shown some
signs of improvement of late.
And with several games
remaining on the schedule, the
Generals could still salvage this
season. They merely need to
find a way out of this vicious
circle.

basketball Generals. Coach
Verne Verne Canfield an-
nounced the selections at the
teams’ annual banquet held last
Wednesday at Lexington’s
Keydet-General Motel.

Dennis is a 6-2 hot-shooting
guard from Towson, Md. In

1976-77, Pat led the team in

scoring with a 21.7 ppg average,
and was voted W&L’s MVP. He
was also a third team All-
American, Conference Player
of the Year, and named
Virginia’s outstanding College
Division Player.

Forlenza is a 5-10 guard from
Sea Girt, New Jersey, and has
been nominated for Academic
All-American honors this
season. He split playing time
this season at point guard with

starter Mike Wenke and
graduating co-captain Kim
Sims.

The 1976-77 team finished at
23-5, were ranked fourth
nationally, and won the ODAC
Title. In conjunction with those
accolades, the following awards

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

‘..a climate of learning that stresses the im-

portance of the individual, his personal honor and
integrity...”’

—from the University’s formal statement

of institutional philosophy

What a laugh.

I resisted the idea for a long time, despite the in-
creasingly overwhelming volume of irrefutable
evidence. I didn’t want to believe it, it couldn’t hap-
pen, not here at Washington and Lee. But the con-
clusion is finally unavoidable:

The faculty and administration of this University
are bent on destroying every shred of personal
freedom and individual responsibility ever accorded
its students. What’s worse is that they are succeeding,
and that we are powerless to stop them.

Sound extreme? I hope so, though I may have just
lost what few friends on the F&A I had. Listen:
they’re trying to take away independent exams. Not
that we couldn’t get along without them; students at
most places never heard of such things. They’re a
luxury. It would be far simpler just to sit back and let
them tell us what we have to do. No long lines at
Newcomb, no danger of students taking their exams
over to the library so they can look everything up, no
agonizing over whether to take the easiest exam first
or last, no sweat, no problem, everything’s taken care
of, except...

Except that it turns the University’s “formal
statement of institutional philosophy’ into a
hypocritical lie. The faculty contend that individual
exams encourage cheating. And so they do. All exams
encourage cheating. (A general invective against
exams is tempting but inappropriate here.) In-
dependent exams also encourage not cheating, and
for a reason that is far more important (if we are to
take the University’s statement seriously) than fear
of being caught. That is: pride in one’s own integrity
and the knowledge that one is totally responsible for
one’s actions. Cheating is bound to occur under any
exam system. Independent exams allow one to choose
not to cheat. The ‘honorable’ course — not cheating
— can hardly be called honorable if it is not a matter
of individual choice.

And now for the really bad news: there’s not a
damn thing we can do about it. Exams, like courses
and degrees, athletics, and the calendar (remember
that debacle?) are totally subject to the whim of the
faculty. Student opinion and feeling have no effect
whatsoever on the faculty’s decisions concerning
students. We haven’t a single vote in these matters;
the University Council, where clown and gown meet,
can only suggest to the faculty that students might
have something to say about the way they are taught,
tested, and graded. The Executive Committee’s
suggestion that some faculty members might not
fully understand the Honor System was received with
something like open hostility by professors who seem
convinced of the infallability of their own logic.

I am always amazed when a principle that ought to
be fundamental and universal (in terms of the
University community, you understand) suddenly
rises to the surface and becomes a debatable issue.
Most of this B. S. was sorted out in the rest of the
academic world five to ten years ago. For the hapless
student at W&L, it may be too late to recover those
rights which never should have been called into

question.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

On the
Boxwoods

Editor:

All alumni who might read
this in the Ring-tum Phi are
urged to hurry to Lexington for
a last look at Washington and
Lee. From the look of things
now the entire campus will soon
be buried under masses of
boxwoods. Walking to class is
becoming difficult act to per-
form because I have been
having nightmares about being
lost in an endless tnagle of four
smelling shrubs.

I mean no disrespect to the
late Mr. Poinor; his warm
feelings for Washington and Lee
are greatly appreciated.
However, the campus is only so
big. Is the next step a potted
boxwood for every professors’
office?

Mr. Parsons has indicated the
disadvantages to the university
on several occasions. His latest
comment that the boxwoods
“give maturity to the land-
scape”’ was therefore a surprise
and in my view wrong. Couldn’t
we either decline the offer of the
additional boxwoods' with
thanks or donate them to
somebody else who could make
better use of them? I am sick to
death of boxwoods. Enough is
enough!

I do, of course, have better
things to do than complain
about the superfluity of box-
woods at Washington and Lee.
It’s too bad Washington and Lee

has nothing better to do than
bury us in boxwoods.

Editor:

As recently as this past
weekend, one more. of

Washington and Lee’s favorite
sons took his first step toward
fame and fortune. On Saturday
evening down at the Hollins

will perhaps rank with the
famed sounds of Rudy Vallie

Waller Trolinger Dudley
climbed up on stage and
presented the crowd with a
lightly, drunken but quite

golden musical history. The
crowd soundly expressed its
approval and after repeated
attempts at turning the
microphone back over to Lester

gave in to the crowd’s wishes
and pleased them with one after
another of the old favorites —
each one fresh and rejuvenated

Ind. Exams Threatened

(continued from page 1)

Dr. Cook is not just
speculating on the cheating, or
to be more specific, the
collusion during exams. He
says, ‘I have heard many of my
colleagues here in the ac-
counting department and other
departments as well complain
about the independent exam
schedule. It is not difficult to see
what they are complaining
about either. For example, the
morning exam schedule is from
9-12 a.m. How could a student
walk in at 10:30 knowing that he
can finish his exam in an hour
and a half. Or take another
example. Last year during the
exam period a dorm counselor
yelled across the freshman
quad to another student that he
did not need to read a certain
’ chapter in order to prepare for
an exam. That is certainly an
honor violation.”’

One professor chose to define
the problem of independent
exams as a problem of leakage
and policing. It took him little
time to think of an example.
“One time,” he said, ‘‘I gave an
exam on a very difficult book,
so difficult that I only used it
one year. Anyway most of my
A-students came in and took the

exam on Saturday and really
struggled with it. Then later in
the week my C and D-students
came in and breezed right
through it. Unfortunately, such
results make me tend to distrust
these students. Certainly it is

possible for a student to im-
prove over the year. But after a
few tests you can generally tell
how a particular student will
score. And we are not just
talking about twelve to fifteen
students in collusion. We’re
talking about sixty perhaps
even eighty students in
collusion. Obviously, this
gravely penalizes the honest
student. Yet when or how will
the student Executive Com-
mittee police this problem.’’

On the other hand, it would be
incorrect to say that the faculty
is of one mind, that is, that
independent exams must be
eliminated. Some professors
sharply disagree claiming that
they have not seen any signs of
such cheating. While it is
somewhat more difficult to
administrate independent
exams the professors see them
as worthwhile because of the
advantage with which they
provide students. In fact most
professors like the idea of in-
dependent exams. They simply
disagree on whether or not
independent exams lead to
more cheating.

Of some importance, too, are
the opinions of the students.
Sandy Stadtman, vice president
of the Executive Committee
(who was quoted last week in
the Ring-tum Phi as saying that
the problem of independent
exams resulted from _ the
faculties misunderstanding of
the Honor System) was anxious

to clear up any misun-
derstandings. ‘‘I did not mean
to say that the faculty is
ignorant of the Honor System
and I’m sorry if anyone got that
impression. Nevertheless the
faculty and the student
Executive Committee do not
always seem to be following the
same Honor Code. I’m _ not
putting the blame on one side or
the other. What I am saying is
that the disagreement is
primarily the result of a lack of
communication.”’

Stradtman, then, moved on
and addressed himself to the
question of how the elimination
of the independent exams would
affect the entire Honor
system.”’ Since the question of
independent exams has been
raised, other problems have
arisen. Can we say that a
student who cheats on his
exams does not cheat anywhere
else? Perhaps we’re just kid-
ding ourselves if we really
believe that cheating does not
exist.”’

At any rate this problem will
be brought up in one form or
another when the faculty meets
to vote on independent exams
this Monday.
