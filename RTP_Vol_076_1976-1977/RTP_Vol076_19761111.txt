SAE pledge suffers injury

An SAE pledge suffered serious
burns as a result of an accident
during a Halloween party at the
SAE fraternity house last Satur-
day, October 30.

According to SAE president Ed
Callison, George Stadler, a fresh-

man from Franklin, Tennessee,
was attending the party on the
upper floor of the building wear-
ing a costume composed of cot-
ton wrapped with adhesive tape.
The costume caught fire when

E.C. quiet .. for now

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

In a peaceful meeting Monday
night the Executive Committee
heard subcommittee reports and
discussed holding hearings about
the Publications Board.

Dave McLean, Ring-tum Phi
business manager, reported that
the RtP is investigating the pos-
sibility of switching to offset
printing. The reasons McLean
gave were that offset is a much
easier process and that it would
give the Phi the option of print-
ing more than four pages.

The added expense would be
financed by raising the advertise-
ment rates, McLean said. It was
also reported that the RtP had
overrun its budget, specifically its
photography budget and that this
may necessitate a request for
added funds from the E.C.

Paul Larkin reported that the
Student Activities Board was
planning a pep rally for the foot-
ball team the Friday of Home-
coming and that the SAB would
pick up the cost of the rally.

Jim Underhill recommended
that the Who’s Who selection com-
mittee be restructured. He sug-
gested that some seniors be ap-
pointed to the committee. As it
stands now the committee is made
up of six juniors and six sopho-
mores. The E.C. tabled discussion
on the matter till a later date.

Walt Kelly requested that the
E.C. open hearings on the state
of the various publications here
at W&L. It was decided to hold
a special meeting at 7 p.m.
Wednesday, Nov. 17. All those
interested are encouraged to at-
tend.

nearby, and the cotton rapidly
became engulfed in flame.

Unable to extinguish the blaze
himself, Mr. Stadler was aided by
several persons close at hand who
helped to put out the fire by
rolling him on the floor, Callison
said.

Mr. Stadler was taken by the
Rescue Squad first to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital. Later he was
transfered to the Burns Center
of the University of Virginia
Medical Center, where he has
since remained. His condition is
now reported to be greatly im-
proved, and he is expected to be
released in about a week and a
half, according to Mr. Callison.

Evans liquor license considered

in the wake of a_ liquorless
senior mixer, Senior Representa-
tive Walt Kelley said he plans to
ask the Executive Committee to
recommend to Dean John that
Evans Dining Hall apply for a
liquor license.

The recommendation would
have to go through the University
Council, and eventually pass the
Board of Trustees before it could

be implemented, according to
Kelley.
Gerry Darrell, manager of

Evans Dining Hall, said he asked
about applying for a special

permit to serve mixed drinks for
the senior mixer but was told by
Whitehead that it was a Board
of Trustees matter.

Dean John said he is not sure
he would support a liquor license
and added that he was not sure
how much support there would be
for the idea.

The lack of a liquor license
came to light several weeks ago
when Evans Dining Hall was un-
able to serve liquor at a senior
mixer. Students from W&L and
surrounding women’s _ schools
came expecting mixed drinks. In-

stead, beer and a wine cooler
were served.

The Cockpit and the dining hall
operate under separate licenses
and both are allowed to serve beer
only. Under this system people
being served beer in Evans Dining
Hall are not allowed to carry it
through the Student Union or into
the Cockpit and those buying beer
in the Cockpit are not allowed
to leave with it.

When ABC licenses for the din-
ing hall and the Cockpit were con-
sidered in 1959 by the Board of
Trustees, they found too many
problems with a liquor license,
according to Dean John.

Primary among the concerns
of the board was the problem of
carding people at an event, ac-
cording to John. The board also
thought a liquor license would be
advantageous to only 20 per cent
of the student body, he said.

A past and present concern of
the administration is the competi-
tion to local merchants W&L
would offer if they expanded to
a liquor license or an off-premises
beer license, John said. James
Whitehead, treasurer of W&L,
stressed that the school does not
intend to compete with local
merchants.

Loan committee
set up to help
broke students

New Staff

The Student Emergency Loan
Committee has been formed as a
joint committee of the Student
Control Committee and the Cold
Check Committee.

In the past the fines collected
by SCC and Cold Check were turn-
ed over to the general fund of
the Eecutive Committee. Bill
Craver, President of SCC, felt that
this money could serve a better
purpose.

The purpose of the Student
Emergency Loan Committee is to
provide loans, in the form of a
promissory, for students who are
facing substantial financial hard-
ship. The loans are made for a
maximum of 30 days and would
be interest free.

Craver said there are no specific
guidelines and the committee is
free to set up its own terms.
Craver emphasized that this com-
mittee is administered and run
solely by students.

The committee members are Ed
Callison, Freeman Jones, Mel
Wileox, and Watson Wright.
Craver said the committee got
organized last week and is now
ready to begin operation. Anyone
seeking further information on
the Student Emergency Loan Com.
mittee is advised to contact one
of the four members.

antenna atop Reid Hall now sends 19-and-a-half hours of programming
to the Lexington-Rockbridge area daily.

More than 50 students are involved in all facets of broadcasting
classical, jazz and rock music, news, public affairs and sports. A
Journalism Department faculty member, Jery! Davis, serves as WLUR's
general manager. But direct control of the staff and day-today pro
gramming decisions are always entrusted to a student station manager

This year’s student leader is John Palda, a senior psychology
major from Cleveland. Palda is perhaps best known to fans of WLUR's
late-night progressive rock show, “Third Ear.”

PHI; WLUR has always been an object of argument among students
who don't understand its role. Why don't you start by deseribing the
station's operating philosophy”

PALDA: WLUR is a community-service station, more or less run
by students, Since we are community service, we are also nonprofit
and we tend to operate as a laboratory for the Journalism Department,
But we do have spots open for other students, too

PHI: Is the goal of serving the community more important than
the idea of acting as a lab, a training ground for students’

PALDA: I think they are equally important, One thing that's come
to my attention within the last couple of weeks is that there are radio
stations at other universities that will always run essentially the same
type of programming. And here's no community service in terms of
diversity of programming

We're a lot more diverse than that. We deal as much with the
tastes of the community as with the tastes of the student body

PHI: Do you think it’s a real community service to run classics
while a station such as WVWR in Roanoke also programs an extensive
amount of classics?

PALDA: Well, yeah, | think it is, because the programming in
ltoanoke is not accessible to local residents. They can request musical
selections from us. At the same time, much of our classical program
ming is, | think, of higher quality

PHL Do students on the WLUR staff agree with you and with the
station's philosophy—or do you have dissension in that area’

PALDA: Just through being connected with the radio station for
three vears, | have been exposed to the different types of programming
and I have seen the rationale behind that programming. So, I'm no
longer bent toward a format that would be all rock or something like
that, which would be programming for a special-interest group

dissension and, luckily, it’s not anything that makes it uncomfortable
to work with the other people, I think they more or less accept our
community-service status.

They'd like to see some change toward more programming for the
student body. But, at the same time, | think they can understand that
since our license is along the lines of a community-service station,
we have to fulfill these requirements of the FCC (Federal Communica-
tions Commission).

And we still have to consider enlarging our audience
only way to do that is to atrract the community-at-large

PHI; Then, is the Lexington community audience more important
to you than the student audience?

PALDA: I'd say that both of them are equally important. The
student audience is important because there really is no other fo m
of radio entertainment in this area that would meet the tastes of the
student body

The Lexington community, at the same time, because we have such
a concentration of educated people in the area, Tm sure they're
dissatisfied with some of the cultural broadcasting that’s provided in
this area. So we have a responsibility to them, too

PHI: This term, WLUR has been experimenting with a schedi'e
which has a great number of innovations in it. For example, tie
classical’ music programming runs later in the evening, from eiy):t
to nidnight. What kind of reaction have you gotten to this?

PALDA: It seems that those who prefer classics prefer that i
in the early evening. And at the same time, those who prefer rock
seem to prefer it at night

PHI: Does this mean you might be changing back to a more trodi
tional schedule next term”

PALDA: We might be. That's something Ill have to speak to
Davis about when we talk about programming for the next semes
I think that will definitely be something we're going to look into

PHIL: This seems to indicate that listener preference plays an im
portant role in your scheduling decisions. Are program ratings impo
ant to you’ Does the value of a show to WLUR depend on how many
people listen to it?

PALDA: That's important in that it carries a lot of weight, but
it doesn’t have the final say in whether we maintain programming
of a certain type. Some of our programs undoubtedly have limited
listenership. But at the same time, we try to present a bit of variety
that’s not presented anywhere else

Programs like that serve to advertise the diversity of the radio
station. If you can't get it somewhere else, you can get it on WLUR
And 1 think, if anything, that’s one of our best advertisements, Di
versity is the name of the game at WLUR

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 11, 1976

Apologia

I know of just one person who liked last week's issue of
the Ring-tum Phi, and it wasn't me. Aside from that, the re-
action was universally in accord: lousy.

Naturally, I feel badly about this. God knows we try and
try to keep this thing at least readable even though it is an
incredible bitch to put out week after week. The presidential
straw poll (ambitious by RtP standards) and the real election
created a physical and emotional tension whose catharsis left
many of us drained and disoriented; attempting to piece to
gether a front page immediately before and after (during, for
some) election night s ino way to enjoy oneself or anybody
else. I've been trying unsuccessfully to relax ever since.

Then there was the communications breakdown between
the editorial and business staffs. We were gathering copy for
a regular four-page edition while they were collecting ads
in anticipation of a special six-page issue which never really
got beyond conceptual form. The real problem there, however,
lies in another area—my friends the very fine printers at the
Journalism Laboratory Press are so overwhelmed with work
that they find the very idea of putting out a six-page paper
laughable, and they're hard to argue with. A similar problem
was encountered this week.

Also: although I feel that the caliber of the copy turned
in to the Ring-tum Phi has been generally higher than in past
years, the number of regular contributors is still frustratingly
low. Negotiations are now in progress whose outcome may
allow us to print six pages at will, but we will not pursue that
course unless convinced that we will receive enough quality
material to make it worthwhile.

Anyway—we know we screwed up and we're sorry,
(Note to F.G.—Write a decent story and I'll give you a
byline and a decent headline.)

Privacy

Oft-noted but never corrected department: I walked into
the Cockpit restroom the other night only to be confronted
with the spectacle of every urinal and stall being occupied by
a group of “locals.” Now, trying not to sound like some sort
of aristocratic elitist pig: what the hell are these people doing
monopolizing our facilities? The reported incidents of theft
and vandalism are but natural symptoms and consequences
of the underlying inconsistency. Yes, many of these persons-
the vast majority of which are young—are probably economi-
cally underprivileged and socially restricted, and all the rest.
They need a place to go. Nonetheless, this University and 1ts
attendant facilities are a private institution and not a public
recreation area. Sure, I'm all for improved “town-gown” rela-
tions and the betterment of the “human condition,” but the
University’s primary responsibility is to its students.

Monday. Twelve midnight. Some
on campus are already asleep,
others are watching the Monday
Night football game, many are
studying. But on the third floor of
Reid Hall, Todd Tyson is engineer-
ing, producing, and hosting the
Monday night installment of
WLUR’s Third Ear program:

“Good evening. It’s 12 o’clock.
My name is Todd Tyson and you're
listening to Third Ear on WLUR,
Lexington.” His voice is calm,
quiet, and precise. He is totally at
ease at the microphone.

Todd is more organized than
most of the disc jockeys who do
Third Ear. He has compiled a
list of the albums that he brought
to the studio with the songs he
intends to play and has a rough
timetable as to when they will
be aired.

The program begins with cuts
from Pablo Cruise and the Elec-
tric Light Orchestra. The albums
are his own. WLUR claims to
have a large record library, but
most of the DJs say it is insuffici-
ent. “The bulk of the records are
outdated, even the recent releases
are records that never made it
and never will; just the physical
condition of most of their (the
station’s) records makes them un-
playable.” He plays a cut from
Al Stewart's latest recording, then
airs a song from one of the

studio’s Traffic albums—the qual-
ity is poor and we can hear static
on the studio’s monitors.

Todd has to keep a listing of
everything he plays in the pro-
gram log. An extensive log is not
required by the FCC, but the
station manager likes to look over
the book. The list is also helpful
for the disc jockeys when they
play five or six songs in a row.

Todd “overdubs” on a rather
sedate Jerry Garcia song, giving
the cuts he has played since the
last break and some humorous
news shorts while the music plays
in the background. The overdub-
bing gives a nice effect over the
air, very professional sounding.
It is the trademark of his shows.

True to his program plan, Todd
plays a recently released album of
a new group called Boston in its
entirety. When he swivels away
from the control panel, one of
the wheels of his chair falls off.
As he bends down to fix it his
only comment is: “all the equip-
ment in this place is in such
great shape.” Only one of the
earphones in the control room’s
headset works.

The phone rarely rings, in fact,
by 1:30, only two calls have come
in. I ask Todd if he ever wond-
ered about how small an audience
he might have. The question seems
to stump him. He hadn’t thought
about it before. “I try to have a

Uncle Vanya

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theater opened
its season Monday night with a
superb rendition of Anton
Chekov’s Uncle Vanya. The play,
which could very easily have
lapsed into the mere bantering
about of melodramatic dialogue,
was held together by some fine
acting and even better direction
by Lee Kahn.

Uncle Vanya is a difficult play
to perform in that it is almost
void of a unifying plot structure.
Nothong really happens in the
play; there is no unravelling of
story, per se. Thus the portrayal
of characters is all important in
Uncle Vanya and the University
Theaters successful production is
all the more laudable because of
this.

The setting for the play is the
rural Russian estate of Alexander
Serebryakov, a retired university
professor. He and his young and
beautiful second wife have re-
cently moved here from the city.
Also in attendence at the house
are Serebryakov’s mother-in-law
from his first marriage, her son,
the professor’s daughter from his
previous marriage, a country doc-
tor and assorted Russian peasents.
The interaction and contrasting
of these various characters is the
motivation of the play. They are
all seemingly trapped in the house
together and are all bored and
unhappy for one reason oF
another.

The title character, Uncle
Vanya, is the most miserable of
all. He despises and is jealous
of his borther-inlaw, the pro-
fessor. Vanya feels that he has
wasted his life and that this is
in part the fault of the professor.
Paul Morella played Vana well,
presenting enough of the char-
acter’s pathos without being
bogged down by it.

Set in opposition to Vanya is
Dr. Astrov. He too feels that he
has wasted his life, but instead
of giving in to melancholy as
Vanya does, Astrov puts on a
cynical mask and shields himself
from human emotions. Except for
a passing passion for the profes-
sor’s wife Yelena, Astrov has no
emotional concern for the mem
bers of the household. Paul Cella
turned in the neatest bit of acting
of the evening as the disillusioned
doctor

In the extremely difficult role
of Serebryakov'’s daughter Sonia,
Betty Kahn offered an excellent
portrayal. Sonia, like Vanya, is
wasting away on the estate. Her
love for Dr. Astrov is one-sided
and she can find not satisfaction
in her life. At times she is miser
able like Vanya, but she also
has the strength to endure her
troubles and carry on with life
Mrs. Kahn dominated the last two

acts of the play with her per-
formance.

Other kudos must go out to
Al Gordon and Pree Ray for their
marvelous character roles as the
professor and his mother-in-law.
In fact the only weak spot in the
whole cast was Kim Bailey’s por-
trayal of the professor's wife.
Much more could have been done
with this role had her acting not
been as stiff as her hairdo.

The production of Uncle Vanya
is the premiere play for the Old
Boiler Room Theatre in the base-
ment of the Old Main Street build-
ing. Renovation of the room has
been going on for some time now
and the result is a unique little
theatre for experimental drama
at W&L. The play was presented
in the surround; the audience sat
on swivel chairs in the middle,
and the action took place all
around them. It one dosn’t mind
knocking knees occasionally it is
an interesting concept. It par-
ticularly lent itself to Uncle
Vanya because the encircling
action gave the audience a much
closer view of the actors, and
this was important because of the
intimacy and subtlety of the play.

The set, and lighting, designed
by Sam Steves as a Senior design
thesis, worked very well in the
Old Boiler Room. The set pro-
vided for some interesting block-
ing and the lighting was con-
trolled enough to enhance the
closeness of the action.

If one can find one major com-
plaint about the production, it
must be that the theatre allows
for so few seats. It is a pity that
more people did not have the op-
portunity to see Uncle Vanya.

balanced program—something for
everyone—but, if nobody’s listen-
ing, at least I like what I’m
playing.” My inquires are inter-
rupted by a comparative deluge
of phone calls. One is a request.
Another is from a VMI keydet
who called to give his sanction
of the Boston album. My timing
must have been bad.

Two of the five calls Todd has
received tonight were requests
for the Flesh Pile Blues Band, so
he has to dig up the station’s
tape of the group. His album show
is drawing to a close, another
record is on the second turntable
ready to go after he finishes his
announcements. While the Allman
Brothers perform on the air, Todd
tries to ready the tape machine
with the Flesh Pile Blues Band,
but during the Grateful Dead he
decides that they are not worth
the trouble. Whoever made the
request will just have to be dis-
appointed tonight.

“It’s one fifty-nine, my name is
Todd, and I'll be with you here
tonight until two-thirty. Its an
abominable twenty-two degrees
outside now...”

Twenty minutes after he had
put the tape back on its shelf,
Todd feels confident that he has
discovered the problem with the
tape player. The former W&L stu-
dents now turned musicians who

comprise the Flesh Pile Blues
Band finally go over the air at
2:17. The first request had been
eight minutes into the show. But
the callers probably didn’t mind
the wait; they were the band
members themselves, partying the
night away somewhere in town.

During a cut from Genesis—one
of the station’s albums, complete
with static and scratches—Todd
starts closing up the station: turn-
ing out the lights, taking the final
transmitter reading, making sure
dors are locked. He uses the over-
dub technique again in his sign-
off. Tis timing is exact and he ends
his commentary just as the song
ends. The cartidge of the station’s
sign-off is inserted in the tape
machine and blares out over the
air, the loud assertive voice of
the announcer is a shock after
two and a half hours of Todd’s
quiet delivery: “WLUR, Lexing-
ton, ninty-one and a half on your
FM dial, concludes another broad-
cast day...”

As we leave the studio and walk
down the corridor, I can hear the
Associated Press wire machines
typing out the latest news in the
dark, empty newsrooms and my
thoughts cannot help but turn to
the guys who will be going into
that room in three and a half
hours preparing to do the morn-
ing show. Maybe someone will
write a story on them, someday.

Dear Mr. Lutz:

As President of the Washington
and Lee University Alumni As-
sociation, I was pleased to read
your recent editorial, which sub-
stantially quoted the talk given
by Sandy Stradtman to this year’s
Freshman Class as a means of
introducing it to our honor sys-
tem. I can assure you that no
tradition is more cherished by our
alumni than the honor system, nor
is any aspect of student life more
likely to stir alumni interest than
problems involving the honor sys-
tem. I have felt in recent years
that too much attention has been
given to matters relating to en-
forcement of the system and too
little attention to the system it-
self as a way of life. Sandy Stradt-
man’s talk convinces me that the
emphasis is now returning to the
honor system as a way of life and
I congratulate him and the entire
student body.

Who's Who?
Dear Editor:

Having just read the article on
the students nominated for Who’s
Who in American Universities and
Colleges, let me just say that

SHEESH SS SSeS ES

 

those names represent the great-
est collection of mediocrity |!
have ever seen. There is only one
student in the entire group who
actually deserves to be included in
Who's Who. (John X. Miller, in
case you're interested.)

The sole prerequisite for in
clusion is apparently the number
of activities the student partici-
pated in. Scholastic ability seems
not to have been considered at all.
It might be interesting to examine
the grade-point-average of some
of these people.

Washington and Lee is a great
university, but you’d never know
it from looking at the list of
W&L students in Who's Who.
W&L should do its part to insure
a student is nominated for that
honor mainly on the basis of
scholastic ability and not because
he is student body president.

IM championship playoffs
won by PiKA, newcomers

The intramural football and
golf seasons have been completed,
and tennis playoffs are to be
wrapped up this week. This year’s
football.champions are the Grand-
standers, and the golf champion
is PiKA. Bouth teams fought their
way successful through regular
seasons and eightteam playoff
formats to become champions of
their respective sports.

PiKa beat the Phi Delts in the
playoff finals to become this year’s
IM golf champions. PiKA was
seeded number one in the playoffs
while Phi Delt was seeded number
two. As expected they met in the
finals. PiKa’s team this year was
made up of Charlie Sipple, Jim
Fisher, and last week’s player of
the week Frank Ellerke. In the
championship match they shot
nine hole scores of 38, 37, and 36
respectively for a combined team
score of 111, handily beating the
Phi Delts’ 121. The other teams
to make the championship play-
offs this year were Sigma Chi,
Delta Tau, SAE, Phi Kappa Psi,
Law, and Lambda Chi. The golf
program was conducted by Head
Official Jim Berlin.

This year’s IM football champ-
ionship was won by a true cind-
erella team. Throughout the regu-
lar season, and the playoffs, the
Grandstanders were barely able to
field enough players to keep from
forfeiting. In the playoffs they

Soccer Generals end
season with victory
over Roanoke College

The soccer Generals put it all
together in the season’s final
game, a 1-0 win over conference
rival Roanoke College. The team
finished the 1976 season with a
3-10 mark, the same as in 1975,
and finished with a 1-3 mark in
conference play. Earlier in the
week, the Generals lost a hard
fought battle to Virginia Tech 1-0,
and were defeated at Hampden-
Sydney 3-1.

Goalkeeper Mark Bennett cap-
ped a brilliant season with the
team’s first shutout. Bennett came
up with 18 saves against Roanoke,
giving him a total of 192 for
the season, a school record. Only
a junior, he is also the school
record holder for most saves in
a career, 238, and most saves in
one game, 28, set against Navy
earlier this season. Bennett will
be the nucleus of next year’s
team.

Sophomore Bill Stone, the Gen-
erals’ most consistent forward all
season, scored the lone goal in
the Roanoke win, with an assist
fom Jamie Veghte. Both Stone
and Bennett have credentials for
all-confernece recognition. Stone
finished the season as the teams’
leading scorer with six goals and
one assist for 13 points. Seniors
captains Jeff Barr and Mike Mona-
han, as well as Doug Hunter play-
ed their final game for in the
Roanoke game, and they went out
in style.

Records for the 1976 season:
Goals for 15; goals against 37:
total shots 262; shots per game
average 20.2.

Individual Scoring records are:
(goals, assists, total) B. Stone 6-1-
13: E. Grandes del Mazo 2-1-5; T.
Tyson 2-1-5; J. Veghte 1-2-4; J.
Page 1-1-3; H. Collier 1-1-3; M.
Manahan 1-0-2.

had to beat the numbers one, two,
and three teams of last season in
order to take the title. They did
ust that, in this, their first year
together. In the finals they beat
a very tough PiKA team.

The championship game was
played in truly adverse conditions.
Monday was cold and windy. The
temperature was in the 30’s and
the wind chill factor was much
lower. Four officials: Bill Flesher,
Jeff Slatcoff, Sal Abruzzese and
Rocky Joyner, worked the game,
and it was tough, clean, and well-
played. The final score, 8-7.

The Grandstanders scored on
their first possession of the game.
Quarterback Bruce Howard con-
nected with wide receiver Chris
Kearney on an eight-yard TD pass
in the corner of the end zone.
The extra point was broken up,
leaving the score 6-0. The two
teams traded first quarter turn-
overs before PiKA statred its own
touchdown drive. Following an

interception by Tad Leithead,
PiKA marched to the six yard
line. Faking a sweep, quarterback
Jim Fisher rolled to his right
and passed across the width of
the field to Cliff Sondack in the
opposite corner of the end zone.
Tom Ezzel left the score at 7-6
Fishers extra point completion to

at the end of the first quarter.

The rest of the first half was
scoreless with the exception of
a drastic safety scored against
PiKA. With ten seconds left in
the half PiKA was froced to punt
on fourth down. The snap flew
over the punter’s head and out
of the back of the end zone. A
safety was called putting the score
at 8-7 in favor of the Grand-
standers.

Neither team scored in the
second half. Both teams played
solid defense, and the gusting
winds made it very difficult to
throw accurately. The Grand-
standers’ defensive front line of
Paul Larkin, Phil Dunlay, and Ed
Rogers constantly presured the
quarterback and were able to
control PiKA’s usually devastat-
ing sweep. Defensive back Maz
Rutland and Chuck Tredgold
bottled up PiKA’s top receiver
Sam Wilburn. The final score was
the same as it had been at half-
time, Grandstanders 8, PiKA 7.

The game’s standout player had
to be Chris earney. Offensively he
caught several passes, including
one for the Grandstanders’ only
touchdown. Defensively he made
three interceptions. All day long
he seemed to be always in the
right place at the right time.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

Generals fall to Millersville

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals will entertain Get-
tysburg College of Pennsylvania
this Saturday at 1:30 p.m. on Wil-
son Field. The game is the teams’
final home contest of the 1976
season.

Gettysburg has a record of
three wins and six defeats on the
season, and will be playing their
final game. The Generals, after a
34-12 defeat to Millersville State
last Saturday, are now 3-5, and
need victories in their final two
games to hit the .500 mark for
the year.

Millersville State proved too
powerful last weekend, as the
Marauders rolled up 31 points
and 306 yards in total offense in

Cross-country team

finish fourth in ODAC

W&L finished in fourth place
in the First Annual Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Cross Coun-
try Championships held in Lex-
ington last Saturday. Eastern Men-
nonite took top honors with 27
points, followed by Bridgewater
with 50, Lynchburg with 52, W&L
with 103, and Hampden-Sydney
with 148. Roanoke College also
competed but with only two run-
ners.

Allen Weeks was the top W&L
runner, finishing in 15th place
mile course. EMC’s Ken Layman
with a time of 27:48 for the five
was the top individual runner
and named conference Runner of
the Year with a first place time
of 25:20.9. That time broke the
course record set in 1969 by
Howell Michael of William and
Mary by 42 seconds.

None of the W&L runners fin-
ished in the top seven, which
would have given them all con-
ference recognition. Mike Burns
came in 18th, Jim Frantz 19th.
Richard Bird 23rd, and Ned Me-
Donald 28th. Coach Roland Landes
of EMC was named the conference
Coach of the Year.

The Generals completed their
dual meet season last weekend
with a record of 9-5.

the first half. W&L fought back
and outscored Millersville in the
second half, but it was a case of
too little too late. The statistics
tell the story in this game, the
Marauders finishing with 443 yds.
in total offense to W&L’s 221.
They also had 249 yds. on the
ground to the Generals’ 71, and
19 yards in the air to W&L’s 150.
Millersville turned the bal lover
six times on four fumbles and two
interceptions, but W&L was only
able to hit paydirt on two occas-
ions.

Junior halfback Raynard Scott,
who played well all afternoon,
scored on a one yard plunge with
1:28 remaining in the first quarter
after W&L had recovered a Mill-
ersville fumble at the Marauder
13. An interference penalty
against Millersville on a pass in-
tended for Scott set up the touch-
down.

W&L’s other tally came on a
pretty pass play from QB Ted
Hissey to flanker Richard Wiles
covering 52 yards. The touchdown
