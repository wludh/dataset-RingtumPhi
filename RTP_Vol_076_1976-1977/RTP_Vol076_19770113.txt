Lexington

\n exhibition of important ex-
amples of American sculpture
from public collection in Lexing-
ton is taking place in duPont Gal-
lery this month.

The exhibition opened last
Tuesday and will continue through
Jan, 24.

In all.©19 pieces ranging from
miniature cameos to larger-than
life statues will be represented in
the display. Most of the pieces
depict the pre-eminent historical
figures associated with Lexington
Gens. George Washington, Robert
I. Lee and Thomas J. (Stonewall)
Jackson, and almost all the
sculptures are owned by Wash-
ington and Lee or Virginia Mili-
tary Institute.

The exhibition is the result of
a year-long research project by
Dr. Pamela Simpson, assistant pro
fessor of art at W&L, and nine
of her art students. This is the
second exhibition of its type Dr.
Simpson and her students have
organized, Last winter, her W&L
art-histery class mounted the well-

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA,

George Waihsngton, by John Crookshank King, 1862
This cameo is typical of King’s work in its meticulous neo-classic-
alism, and in design probably derives from the famous sculpture
of Washington by Jean Antoine Houdon (also represented in the
Lexington sculpture exhibition).

half of their equipment costs and
that the club could supplement
the remainder. The cost of a foil,
mask and half-jacket is about $45.
Worth said.

The E.C. indicated a_ willing-

man year at St. Christopher’s
school in Riehmond. The town of
Mineral was replacing its obso-

him have the city limits sign in
order to prove a point to his
classmates.

He said his fellow students
joked with him about being from
a town so small the road signs
said “Entering Mineral’ on one
side and “Leaving Mineral” on the
other. He got the sign to prove
his colleagues thet it was one-
sided,

Dickinson has a letter from th?
town of Mineral saying he got the
‘ign legitimately. But he said he
refrained from teiling the police
that it was legal until he could
find out how they found his sign
and whether they used improper
methods.

He said he has since found out
that the dog warden reported see
ing some other signs, for which
Diekinson gives his room-mates
credit, when he came to take care
of some stray dogs in the area
during the Christmas break.

The police came to check on
the signs and found the door ajar.
Dickinson said, and went inside
to investigate. Dickinson said the

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Parking

Many W&L students have cars, and many live some con-

siderable distance from campus. This much is clear.

What is unclear is where these students are to park their
cars when they manage to roll in for class. On-campus park-

ing is physically restricted to a limited area which must be
shared by faculty, students, and staff. Much of this area is
officially off-limits to most student vehicles, and the close
vigilance of the University Proctor and his staff usually keep
it that way, unless one can afford Murph’s “fees” on a
recular basis.

So the forlorn commuter is foreed to park his car on the
streets of Lexington. This wouldn't be so bad if only it were
possible. Two-hour limits on virtually all available space mean
that students parked on, say, Lee Avenue between Sigma
Chi P.O, must either back and forth
campus every two hours and hope to find another place down

and the dash from
the street, erase the chalk marks on the tires (check both front
and rear, these fellows are cunning), or resign themselves
once more to paying the city of Lexington for use of space
which nobody else uses anyway.

All this amounts to another chapter in the continuing rip-
off of W&L students by the City of Lexington, How long will
we be forced to pay tribute to these people? It has been
suggested that a petition be circulated among students urging
the removal of unnecessary parking restrictions on the streets
surrounding the University. \s a legitimate means of fighting
City Hall, it’s worth a try. We can always get violent later on,

—RDL

Inertia

Reports from the last faculty meeting indicate that this
august body in continuing its policy of ignoring student needs
through inaction, in keeping with the infamous Winter Break

non-deeision,

The debate centered around the grading system currently
in use at W&L, The four-point system is archaic, arbitrary,
and inadequate as regards effective evaluation of student per

formance, An expanded system including plus and minus

notations, long favored by many faculty members, was pro-
posed and voted down. As no alternative could be agreed
upon, the discussion was tabled.

Cpinions on the subject are, of course, widely divergent,
Many professors seem comfortable with the current system.
It is extremely simple, requiring little effort or evaluation on
the part of the teacher, and it is widely recognized by graduaie
schools and businesses as a determining factor in a student’
overall record. But none of this means that the four-potat

system is any good, only that it is easier to leave it alone than

to try to change it.

One professor's ideal is a system of written remarks with
out any specific notational system. This would require care/ul

and extended thought on the teacher's part. Too much to

ask, | think, of people whose apparent main interest is in
doing as little as possible; an ideal it will remain,

By M. GRAY COLEMAN
Entertainment Editor

It takes nothing more than a
cursory glance at a W&L cata-
logue of around ten years ago to
see the recent blossoming that
the field of art has experienced.
Just what was being offered
around the mid-1960’s? That was
only a smattering of courses in

art, drama, and music, loosely
organized under the banner of
Fine Arts, and nothing more. The
Troubadour Theatre lacked not
only a workshop for set design,
but such necessities as dressing
and make-up facilities. People say
it was not uncommon to see actors
sitting on the steps, running down
the outside of the small building,
waiting for their cue to go on-
stage! Though the “trooper spirit”
of these people can be appreci-
ated, it can hardly be imagined
today.

Indeed, the arts have come a

very long way in the past decade.
But, they have hardly reached
the end which will bring them
on an equal footing with many
other academie departments. The
music department is split between
the glamorous basement of the
Student Center and a tottering
McCormick Library; The visual
arts are also divided between a
few axeas in duPont Hall and
Howe Annex (a building that
half the student body isn’t even
aware of); and the thespians carry
on valiantly in a_ reconverted,
barnlike building, and a laundry
boiler room. It must be admitted
that the arts here are not living
“the good life.” Not yet. But,
slowly, surely, they are getting
there. It is the purpose of the
Ring-tum Phi, in the next three
weeks, to take an in-depth look
at each of the fine art depart-
ments, assess their progress,
illustrate their needs, and specu-
late about their futures.

Today, the Department of Fine
Arts is made up of three quasi-
autonomous divisions, each offer-
ing its own major in the catalogue.
Division heads are Leonel Kahn
(drama), Gerard Doyon (art), and
Robert Stewart (music). Serving
as administrative head of the en-
tire department is Dr, Albert C.
Gordon, who came to W&L in
1974 from the University of
Toledo. Dr. Gordon’s entrance
into the faculty is but one ex-
ample of the growth of the arts
as regards staff, which has more
than doubled in the past ten years.

“There is a master plan for
development in this area,” he
commented. “The final goal is to
bring all the music and visual arts
under one roof in duPont Hall,
and move all the unrelated de-
partments into other facilities. As
a matter of fact, the original
grant establishing duPont design-
ated it for the arts. We hope
to exand the studios and gallery

Pat Darr: the man in charge
of Capital Centre

The following interview is the
first of a projected series of
feature articles dealing with
major entertainment events in
the Washington, D.C. area.

By DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

Pat Darr is the director of
events for the Capital Centre in
Landover, Maryland.

Rtp: How yould you describe
your job?

Darr: My job is to book the

building and keep it busy. That
can take two or three different
forms. First, a guy comes in and
says that he wants to -rent the
building for an event. We have
standard terms and sign a con-
tra’t with the individual and
that’s it. My responsibility would
be to negotiate the terms of the
contra‘t. make sure it fits in
with the seheduling we have, and
coordinate with all the other de-
partments to let them know what's
going on so they can make their
services available to the promoter.
Another ease is where we go
out and copromote an event with
somebody. An example is the Ice
Capades. instead of getting stand-
ard rent, it’s like a 50-50 deal.
The third way is where we go out
and ereate our own events. For
example, we have what we call
the Washington Internationa!
World of Plants coming up in
March where we are putting on
a show on our own. This is a
eeneral type of job because every
event is different.

Rip: What do you look for in
an act to determine if it will be
successful here?

Darr: Generally, how well they
have done in other parts of the
country. First, | find out how well
an act has done in other parts of
the country, and why it has done
well. For example, there is a
Canadian skating star's ice show
which sells out everywhere it
goes in Canada, but it wouldn't

sell ten tickets in this market.
So, even if a show does well in
certain areas, it wouldn't neces-
sarily do well here, so that’s why
you have to look into it a little
bit more. Another indicator is
trade publications like Billboard
and Variety. You read those re-
ligiously.

Rtp: What indicators do you go
by to determine if an act will
succeed with the Washington area
audience?

Darr: Washington has certain
traits about it. It is a fairly so-
phistieated market. It doesn’t go
in big for country shows or religi-
oits type things like “Jesus Christ
Superstar.” This is a good place
to bring things like the Soviet
cireus. In basketball and hockey,
big draws are when New York
and Boston play here, because
there are a lot of people from
those areas living here. In gen-
eral, you gure that you’re dealing
with an upper-middle class mix of
people from all over the country,
and they’re pretty sophisticated,
so that’s the target area we aim
for.

Rtp: How do you know what
acts are available?

Darr: Generally, when a tour
is put together, they'll contact the
ten or fifteen largest arenas in
the country. They contact us to
say that they’re available and if
we would consider playing their
chow. They need us as much as
we need them. They need to play
Washington. It’s the sixth largest
metropolitan area in the United
States, with the highest per capita
income in the United States.
Another souree of who's touring
are the trade papers.

Rtp: How do most groups want
to be paid, a set guaranteed fee
or a percentage of the receipts?

Darr: Generally they want both.
There are acts you can buy very
cheaply and there are acts that

know they’re going to sell out
and you know they're going to sell
out, and they tell you what you
are going to pay them. But, in
most of the cases of the acts who
are going to come close to selling
out, they want a minimum guaran-
tee. A typical example would be
something like $25,000 guaranteed
to the act plus about 60% of
everything over $70,000. That’s a
typical rock act type of arrange-
ment today. Somebody like Led
Zeppelin or Elvis Presley, in some
cases come in and tell you how
much rent they’re going to pay,

‘and you can take it or leave it.

Every act is individual and has
to be dealt with differently. Out-
side of the rock world, things are
pretty reasonable. A typical dea!
with a non-rock act is a 50-50 deal.
You take advertising off the top
and split the money 50-50. That
way you're both partners in the
show with art equal stake.

Rtp: Being an agent for the
Centre, do you just deal with
other agents, or are there any
acts which make their own deals
without an agent?

Darr: I can't think of anytime
we've ever dealt directly with the
entertainer himself. They don’t

the “Bad Guy” and making the
money deals.

apart as possible and fill in with
the small stuff as we go along.
We book things up until the day

next day. Musie acts are booked,
maybe at the most, two months
in advance,

on the ground floor, move the
music professors into the second
floor, and use the entire third
flood as a large rehearsal hall.
An art library, on a par with
other departmental collections
like journalism or the sciences,
is aiso being discussed.” Evi-
dently, there would have been
no objection to beginning these
plans this year, but for the be-
ginning of the new library as a
more urgent concern. The dis-
placement of a large number of
faculty members and the begin-
ning of renovation on Tucker Hall
left very little surplus moving
room for such a project. But, it
is definitely on schedule to begin
once these inconveniences are
passed.

Another heaithy sign is the
rapid creation of new courses.
“We realized the need for basic
introductory courses in drama and
art, on a par with the already-
existing Musie 151. The admini-
stration cooperated fully with us
on this idea, and as a result, we
are offering Art 100 and Drama
139.” said Gordon. Another new
course is Drama 140, a styles-
oriented offering that will include
a tutorial session of several weeks
with the Warsaw mime group that
appeared on campus earlier this
year. It will deal with voice,
dition is Musie 100. a one-credit
eourse to be offered fall and
winter terms, beginning next
year. It wil Ideal with coice,
ennunciation, and projection for
actors and singers; and will be
taught by Gordon Spice.

Dr. Gordon and his colleagues
feel that the small size of the
department may lead to some set-
backs, but there are definite good
points to be mentioned. Their
philosophy of fine arts to retain
the small size, making it easier
to increase quality, while opening
the department to all who are
interested. One final idea on the
drawing-board at this time is a
fourth type of major—a major in
Fine Arts as a whole. The student
will take courses in ali three
divisions, in order to see the na-
tural union of the three branches.
Generally, this would be a fine
arts version of a Commerce major
in Newcomb Hall. as opposed to
straight accounting or economics.

Many different people, from the
most hard-core drama major to
the individual who has never seen
duPont Art Gallery, bemoan that
the fine arts are not developed
to the degree they should be. In
all fairness. this is true. The
building and laboratory facilities
of the fine arts (whether it be
stage facilities, musie listening
rooms, or callery space) should be
on an equal level with any other
department on campus. W&L may
not be a professional preparatory
art school, but it is also not a
professional business college—at
least officially. This is truly a
liberal arts university, and each
department within it should be
well developed toe provide the
necessary balance. Looking at the
record of the past ten years. it
seems safe to say that the uni-
versity administration is working
for, and sveceeding so far, in just
that goal.

Generals clean up at tournament

By JERRY HARRIS

“General Hoop-la”, the official
basketball program of the Gen-
erals basketball team, predicted
that the eighth annual Washing-
ton and Lee Invitational tourna-
ment “should make for two eve-
nings of edge-of-your-seat excite-
ment.”

That prediction turned out to be
only half right, however, as only
the final night of basketball action
proved to be exciting. The Gen-
erals overcame a stingy man-to-
man defense and a halftime deficit
to take the championship trophy
from Grove City, 60-57, while
Ifaverford College slipped by the
University of North Carolina at
Greensboro Spartans, 80-76, in the
consolation game. Grove City ad-
vanced to the finals by hammer-
ing Haverford 90-73 and: W&L
easily outlasted UNCG 86-70 in
the second game on Friday night.

The Generals had little dif-
ficulty with the Greensboro Spart-
ans in the second half of their
semi-final tilt but the reverse was
the case in the first half. Led
by the inside shooting of Bob
lint and some hot outside shoot-
ing, W&L overcame a tall UNCG
lineup to chalk up a four-point
lead with less than five minutes to
go in the first half. Less than a
minute later, however, the Spart-
ans had taken a 37-32 lead with
the help of a three-point play and
two technical foul shots.

But W&L came right back to
knot the score up and take a
three-point half-time lead. At that

point it appeared that the Gen-
erals and UNCG were going to
battie it out right up to the buzzer.
The Spartans were penetrating
the W&L zone with some ease
and held a slight edge in re-
bounds. Menwhile, the Generals
were missing their assignments on
defense and only Bob Flint was
having a good offensive game. But
such was not the case.

Showing their best defensive
performance of the year, W&L
came out in the second half to
completely dominate the Spartans.
An aggressive man-to-man de-
fense combined with some timely
rebounding by Don Berlin held
UNCG to only one shot for much
of the second half. Meanwhile,
Berlin, Flint, Pat Dennis and
Chris Larson were shooting holes
in the Spartans’ defense.

The turning point of the contest
came mid-way through the last
half when Generals head coach
Verne Canfield inserted the line-
up of Larson, Flint, Kim Sims,
Bruce Williams and Ardith Col-
lins. That contingent completely
manhandled the Spartans on de-
fense while stretching. a six-point
lead into a 14-point margin.

UNCG pulled to within eight
points near the end of the game
on the strength of a desperate
full-eourt press. But some clutch
foul shooting by Larson, Flint, and
Dennis put the game safely out
of reach. W&L placed five men in
double figures. Berlin and Dennis
both put in 16 points while Dave
Leuning and Larson scored 12

markers. Flint led the Generals
offense with 18 points and 12 re-
bounds. :

In the championship contest,
the Generals faced an opponent
that was ironically very much
similar to their own style of play.
Grove City depended on a tenaci-
ous man-to-man defense while
working patiently for the short
jump shot on offense. In addition
to this bothersome similarity of
style, W&L had the additional
problem a Grove City lineup that
included two six-foot four-inch
guards.

The problems did not phase the
Generals in the opening moments,
however, as a fired up contingent
jumped on the visiting Wolverine
for a quick 6-0 lead. But W&L
went cold on offense just as
quickly as they had turned hot.
Grove City took advantage of that
suden cold streak to pick apart
the General zone defense and tie
the score up at eight apiece. The
two teams traded baskets until
the half with Grove City holding
the edge at 32-30.

The second half started off with
a bang for the Wolevrines, run-
ning off eight straight points to
take a 40-34 edge. Washington and
Lee caught up on some patient
offensive patterns but Grove City
appeared to be holding on. The
Generals caught fire when a
couple of questionable calls went
against them and Larson, Dennis
and Don Berlin led W&L to a 48-
44 lead.

Grove City pulled back in front
with four minutes to play but
that was to be their last gasp.
Berlin began to take control of
the boards, pulling down almost

Swimmers take

first loss

After victories over Madison
and Richmond, Coach Bill Stearn’s
mermen suffered their first set-
back of the season Saturday, 65-
48 loss to strong Virginia Tech.
It was a close meet throughout,
but the Gobbler’s depth proved
too difficult to overcome.

W&L winners included John
Hudson in the 1000 freestyle,
Chip Hoke in the 500 freestyle,
Pete Meem in the 200 breastroke,
and the 400 freestyle relay team
of Hudson, Tad LanLeer, Keith
Romich, and Scott Duff. That relay
team is the top-rated NCAA Di-
vision Ill team in the country.

Hoke also took second place in
the 1000 free and 200 individual
medley, while VanLeer took sec-
ond in the 50 and 100 free. Keith
Romich was second place finisher
in the 200 free and 200 butterfly,
and Drew Pillsbury took second in
the 200 backstroke.

The swimming Generals are in
ation again on Saturday at
George Washington University,
with a home tri-meet the follow-
ing Friday against cross-town
rival V.M.1. and Towson State.

Perry named All-American

The football Generals’ eo-cap-
tain Tony Perry was recently
named to the first team Division
lll Coaches’ All-American team,
and also to the Mutual Black Net-
work’s All-American team.

Perry is W&L’s all-time leading
pass receiver with 154 passes for
2122 vards and 16 touchdowns.
He is also the first player in
W&L history to be named as a
first team All-American selection.
Players have received an honor-
able mention in the past. however.

When asked about the award.
Perry said that he was most
happy to receive it and that dur-
ing his career he considered it
“the highest individual goal I had
hoped to atiain.” He was chosen
as an honorable mention as a
sophomore.

Perry said he was proud of his
Coaches’ selection becatise many
coaches around the nation recog-
nized him for what he is—a
good football player. He possesses
a special type of pride for the

because he was chosen from

tion as an outstanding player.

elaboration, he said the team was
better prepared, both mentally
and physically; the coaches pre-
pared the team sooner; and in

practive, they actually played
football somewhat different
from the past. All in all, a

stronger program was put into
practice.

Though pleased with the honor,
Perry was not too pleased with
the role he played this year. The
previous three years he had been
used as a pass-receiving tight end.
This year, his role was changed
to that of a blocking end. There
fore, though the coaches may have
thought he helped the team more
in this eapacity, his statistical
performance wasn't what it had
previously been.

“My role was that of a block-
ing tight end, used primarily as
a decoy. When | did go out for
a pass, | would be doubled cov-
ered, leaving some of my team-
mates uncovered. This definitely
helped the team; I just wish I
had a chance to catch more
passes,”

ed his selection to his coaches

in receptions with 31, and Farrar
played behind Perry.

Perry, who is a sociology ma-
jor with an Army commitment,
wants very much to play pro
football. “I have to admit, that
is definitely one of my goals.”
Ile says that about every team
has contacted him in one form or
another, but as yet none have
shown a strong interest in him.
Among the teams that have travel-
ed to W&L to talk with him are
San Diego, the Jets, New Eng-
land, and Cineinnati.

Although Perry still has track
season ahead of him. his college
sports career is rapidly coming to
a close. Not only has he proved
himself on the athletic fields of
endeavor, but also in the W&L
community and as a leader in
the KOTC program, His departure
will leave a large gap. not to be

all of his nine grabs in the final
moments of the contest. Berlin
combined his clutch inside shots
with some long range bombs by
Dennis to lead the Generals to a
59-53 margin with 41 seconds to
go. The Wolverines pressed to
eatch up but two foul shots by
Dennis put it away for good. Ber-
lin ended up with 13 markers for
his second solid performance in
two nights. Dennis tallied 15
points to lead the Generals and
Larson chipped in 11 points.

Potentially, this was the strong-
est field ever for the annual
Invitation tournament. But that
potential was hard to see most of
the time. Haverford entered the
weekend play with a perfect 7-0
record, Grove City held a 7-1
mark, W&L was 6-2 and UNCG
was 4-3. The Generals, though,
were clearly the class of the field
showing both a balanced scoring
attack and some tight defense.

Don Berlin and Pat Dennis
made the All-Tournament team
with Berlin capturing the MVP
award. Grove City’s Donahoe, Bil!
Travis of Haverford and Mark
Bullock of UNCG completed the
five man all-star club.

Wrestlers

After about a three week layoff,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team rolls (or by the time you
read this, rolled) into action
against Eastern Mennonite. Asked
if some of his wrestlers might
not be a little out of shape after
such a layoff, Coach Franke re-
sponded that he did not think so.
“Over Christmas vacation most of
them wrestle at their high schools
and stay in good shape. Actually
we are a little ahead of where
we ought to be right now. Con-
ditioning is pretty much over. It
is simply a matter of improving
our technique.”

With this in mind the Generals
look ahead to the last half of
their season, and with some opti-
mism too. At 3-1 they have a big
win against VMI under their belts
and that much more confidence.
So what does the rest of the
season look like? “I feel we have
a very good chance to win the
league this year. Part of the rea-
son, of course, is that the ODAC
is not as strong as the old VCAA
was. Though we still have to
wrestle strong teams such as
George Mason nad Madison, they
are not in the league.” Perhaps
it is also possible that this year’s
team is slightly stronger than
that of last year owing to another
year’s experdience and some fine
freshmen.

But any analysis of the W&L
wrestling team must start with
captain Jim Crytzer. In the fourth
year of a superior career, Jim is
(8-1) and was named the most
valuable wrestler of the W&L
wrestling tournament. But sta-
tisties are only a small! indication
of his value to the team. Coach
Franke comments. “Jimmy is a
very flexible wrestler who can
wrestle at 158, 167, or 177 de-
pending on the opposition. For
example, against VMI we moved
Jimmy to 167 to wrestle Pearson
and instead of losing three points
we gained six when Jimmy was
able to pin him. That was the dif-
ference in the match.” W&L beat
VMI for the first time ever, 25-23

Another reason for the success
of this year’s team is the emerg-
ence of Ed “Stork” Rodgers (6-3)
as a top wrestler. Only a sopho
more, Ed's suecess stems largely
from his decision to concentrate
on wrestling as his only sport in
college. “Last year Eddie played
football too and, as a result, had
to come out for the team halfway

The Atlanta Rhythm Section is
determined to, as they say in the
South, “kick ass.” They're excited
about a fresh start with Polydor,
who believes they've got the
cream of the crop in Southern
rock.

“Third Annual Pipe Dream” is
the name of the Atlanta Rhythm
Section’s first LP for Polydor.
They consider it the best thing
they’ve ever recorded, and their
standards for themselves are
exacting. One critic who had an
advance listen to the album called
it “A milestone in Southern
music... or just plain music.”

The Atlanta Rhythm Section
has been waiting a long time for
recognition. But these proud
Southern men know that they’re
ready now in a way that they
weren't before.

And their fans, who include
Procol Harum, Eric Clapton, Joe
Cocker and many, many others,
would probably agree with them
when they say they feel sure the
“Third Annual Pipe Dream” is
about to become a reality.

their live performances!

Their first album, “See The
