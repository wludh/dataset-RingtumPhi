They said they would, but they
didn't.

Citing the death of a relative as
cause, the Marvelettes cancelled
their scheduled apeparance at
W&L’s Homecoming bash last Fri-
day night.

Mike Armstrong, co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board, said
David Zaan, agent for the Mar-
velettes, called Thursday after-
non to ask if the engagement was
a concert or a dance. Zaan said
the Marvelettes didn’t want to do
a dance because they had a spec-
ial show.

“That was fine with us,” said
Armstrong, becauseth eir show
is a dance kind of thing.’

Zaan said they really didn’t

want to do the show but would

to explain the group was experi-
encing “internal problems” and
would be unable to perform Fri-
day.

“They gave us the excuse that
one of them had a father or
grandfather die and she was very
upset,” Armstrong said.

Mike Capetto, faculty adviser
of the SAB, said the contract had
certain clauses which would allow
one party to cancel the contract.

ricane, acts of war and other acts

Construction
almost on time

By LEE HOWARD
Adverse October weather and
blasting difficulties have caused
construction on the new library
to fall two weeks behind schedule
after only four months of work.
According to Construction
Supervisor Pat Brady, the major
cause of the delay was a cold, wet
October. Eight days were set
aside as rain days but were ap-
parently not enough. The cold
weather made it unfeasible to
pour cement, Brady said.
Suprisingly obdurate rock has
also been a significant cause of
the delay, making blasting less
effective, Brady said. Compound-
ing this problem has been the
necessity of using smaller charges
because of the damage done by
a large dynamite shot a few
weeks ago. his has meant that
more charges have to bet set and
this takes more time he said.
Brady said he sees no reason
why, weather permitting, the
(hirty-month job could not be
completed on time. He said there
is no problem acquiring building
materials as there was during
construction of the new law
school. He added that there should
be no delays of the magnitude of
either the law school or the
Woods Creek apartments.

of God were excuses for backing
out. “It’s the act of God clause
that they will contest’ Capetto
said.

“We didn’t think the Mar-
velettes were the kind of act
that would cancel out or try to
pull any shenanigans,” he said. “I
don’t really think this will end up
in court. We'll just say ‘Listen,
we lost a thousand bucks. What
are you going to do about it?’
And hopefully, we can agree on
some out-of-court settlement.”

Armstrong feels that the Mar-
veiettes do not have solid grounds
for breaking the contract. He
said “We are having a lawyer
look over the contract and we are
asking the Marvelettes for a letter
of explanation. “If it doesn’t suit
our purposes,” Armstrong § said,
‘we could possibly proceed into
litigation. But right now, it is
up in the air. We’re going to see
if they were working somewhere
else.”

John Berley, the other co-chair-
man of the SAB, said the school
may lose about $100. He said the
SAB originally planned to charge
one dollar admission for the
dance, but when the Marvelettes
cancelled, the SAB decided not
to charge admission. Berley said

Republicans

By JIM PARKER

An internal rift over whether
to continue membership in the
College Republican Federation of
Virginia has been settled by
W&L’s CR club, and the decision
is to remain within the federation.

Club officials maintain that the
rift no longer exists and that
the split among members has been
healed.

Some members wanted to pull
out of the federation because of
the dominant role of the Uni-
versity of Virginia College Re-
publican Club, according to W&L
Republican Club President Chuck
Rogers. That split has been mend-
ed now, he said.

Bill Kerr, one of the supporters
of pulling out of the federation,
said that the CRs will vote in
favor of remaining in the organi-
ation and the club members will
support the decision “200 per
cent.”

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, NOVEMBER 18, 1976

SAB investigate back out

he expected 1000 persons to at-
tend.

Capetto feels the SAB has three
alternatives. Their first is to file
a complaint with the National
Entertainment Conference in
Columbia, 8.C. That organization,
composed of nearly all colleges
and booking firms in the nation,
would investigate and try to solve
the matter.

Their second alternative is to
drop the question entirely, “If
the SAB thinks the replacement
band was good and that every-
body had a good time, they could
just forget the whole thing” said
Capetto. “The court fees and
lawyer expenses could nearly use
up a $1009 settlement.”

The SAB’s final alternative
would be to sue the Marvelettes.
Capetto said, “The courts are way
down on the bottom of the list.
There are a whole lot of other
things we can do first. All we
would like to do is to resolve the
issue. They may have a very
logical excuse for not showing up
that we don’t know about. Maybe
the Marvelette had swine flu, I
don’t know. If they had a good
substantiated reason for not at-
tending the dance Friday night,
we'll drop the matter,” he said.

heal rift

A major reason for staying in
the federation is to give the
freshmen members a chance to
work for the organization, accord-
ing to W. J. Lorentz de Haas.
Among the group in favor of
staying in the federation were Ben
Lowe, Lorentz de Haas, who is
running for a spot on the federa-
tion board, and freshman E.C.
Representative Jacob Jones.
Among the opposition were Bill
Kerr and Mike Adams.

The W&L organization has
been named the best college
Republican club in the nation four
of the five times it has been
awarded. The newsletter put out
by the club has been named num-
ber one in the country in 1971
and 1975. The club has also helped
start Republican organizations at
most of the area girls’ schools,
including Sweet Briar, Randolph-
Macon and Southern Seminary.

The University Democrats

picked up dovens of new members. Students reasoned, What better
way to protest the corrupt Republican Administration?”

One of the multitude of impeachment petitions came from the
Washington and Lee University Democrats. Like their brothers and

Warner & Taylor
speak at W@L

On the morning of November
11, a press conference was held by
former Secretary of the Navy
John Warner and his fiance Eliza-
beth Taylor.

Q: Mr. Warner, since Senator
Scott has just announced that he
is not going to run for a Senate
seat again in 1978, are you pre-
pared to announce that you might
run for that seat?

Warner: I am not a candidate
for public oflice. | have a very
strong feeling for Washington and
Lee, and VMI, and I think it
would be wrong for any individual
to accept an invitation from either
institution and then use that in-
vitation and the presence on these
really hallowed, venerable
grounds to foster any political in-
terests the individual might have.

Q: Mr. Warner, you're out of
a job now, so what will you be
doing?

Warner: This is really the first
period of time when I've been
unemployed, I just hope I can
support you (to Miss Taylor); if
I can't, will you support me?

I think the people who worked in the Carter campaign are still
interested in doing other political activities the rest of the year. That

wasn't their sole interest.

RtP: Well, for a lot of people—that was their sole interest, How
do you get them to stick with the club?

WINN: We plan to try to keep their interest up. We have several
projects planned. We're going to have a joint party with the Randolph

Macon Woman's College YDs

And then we have something in the

works that I can’t tell you about at this moment.
We plan to participate in the state convention at the end of the
year. And in the statewide Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner, too, That's

for all state Democrats
RiP

young and old.
Still, interest among some members could wane, as it did

in 1974. Do you think you could be entering a critical phase in the

club's development now’

WINN: Yes, I think this is a transition period right now. But with
the projects we have planned, we still should be able to reach the
people who have other interests besides the presidential election

RiP: Money was always a problem for the old W&L Young Demo
crats. How about with the new ones”

I really don't know if | should say exactly how much we

to keep the Young Democrats alive

But this year, there has been an attempted resurrection. Sopho
more Benn Winn, a politics major from Martinsville, Va., is the presi
dent of the brandnew W&L Young Democrats. And somehow, his
group has managed to find 33 campus Democrats willing to pay dues

Some observers even say that the club might have a bright future

utr: Democrats are definitely in the minority at W&L. Do you
have any idea how many there are in the student body?

WINN: I really couldn't say. Students can call themselves Demo
erats, but there’s a difference between activists and people who just
say. “I'm a Democrat.” We think we've reached most of the activists
here are a few we're still after

hiP: De vou think the widespread interest in the presidential
election could be the reason for your surprising success in getting
members?

WINN: Our large turnout could be attributed to that. But I think
we've managed to keep the interest high enough that it'll carry on
Our activists are interested in all polilical campaigns and all political

functions

have. But we did pick up some money the other club left. So we're
sitting fairly well right now. | ean say we do have enough money to
carry on our minor projects

RiP: An earlier Ringtum Phi story said your membership comes
mostly from the underclassmen. Is that still true?

WINN: No, we have several seniors. It's pretty well evenly dis
tributed, | would say. The article you printed earlier said we had only
one senior, At the time, we did. But we have several seniors now

RtP: You sound optimistic about the elub’s future. What's the
difference between you and the previous unsuccessful attempts’

WINN: Well, I don't know that much about the previous attempts
But I think it may have been a failing of the other clubs that they
didn’t try to do anything. But we have our projects—and there's a
gubernatorial election coming up next year that should be of interest
to everyone

We're definitely not here just to counteract the Republicans on
campus. This is to give people who consider themselves Democrats
something to identify with. We're a close-knit group.

i think we're going to be a growing club

Ilowever, I have a marvelous
farm, which is the joy of my
life, on which I've been living now
for eight years in northern Vir-
ginia. It is a big operating catile
farm, and Miss Taylor and | are
going to live there, it’s our resi-
dence.

You might be interested to
know that this summer, once Miss
Taylor consented to marry me,
she went out and branded her
first calf one morning at 6:30. So,
we're going to take a consider-
able interest in our farm for the
forseeable future.

Q: Do you think you'll be able
to support Miss Taylor on a farm
in the style with which she is
accustomed?

Warner: Surely: from out of
nowhere, several things keep pil-
ing up, so I think for the im-
mediate future we'll have suflici-
ent funds. I would like to say that
we re going to cure our own hams
for Thanksgiving and Christmas—

Taylor: I prefer a turkey.

Warner: | think one other thing
is of interest. I gave. with the
greatest of joy, an engagement
ring which I designed myself, and
she gave me in return, two dairy
cows and a bull. So, we're off
to a good start.

Q: Has a wedding date been
set, Mr. Warner.

Warner: We decided that the
best way to arrange the wedding
was to give our mothers, both in
their 80's, full discretion and con-
trol, At this moment, they are
trying to gather up a handful! of
children. some of whom are
scattered abroad, and mine here
in school. As soon as we <an
get the children together, and the
two 80-year-old mothers select the
date, we'll have it.

Q: Miss Taylor, what attracted
you to Mr. Warner?

Taylor: His integrity. and honor:
I like everything about him

Q: What are your impressions
of Lexington’

Taylor: Well, to give a cor vet
impression, I would have
here longer. My immediate in
pression is one of such unity;
everybody works together. It is
a beautiful place. I wish 1 could
stay here longer

Later that afternoon Mr
Warner and Miss Taylor attended
4a reception sponsored by the
W&L Republicans. As the couple
walked toward their ear follow
ing the reception, Mr. Warner
made his final comment to Wash

of you who are the very sources and causes of my anger and

Last night at 7 o'clock the E.C, was scheduled to begin a
long-awaited investigation into the workings of the Publica-
tions Board with the intention, according to George Griffin,
junior representative, of doing “whatever we have to do to
make the constitutions coincide.”

He was referring to the student body constitution, which
the E.C. swears to uphold, and the Publications Board consti-
tution, which is none of the E.C.’s dman business.

The investigation is the latest addition to the E.C.’s long
and reckless record of unnecessary intrusion into the function-
ing of the various campus media, ~

The interference began last year when the 75-76 E.C.
told the staff of the ill-fated W&L Thymes what they could
print if they wanted any more student body funds for their
publication.

Later in the year the E.C. agreed to give WLUR enough
cash to supplement their sports budget and allow the radio
station to broadcast away lacrosse games, The allocation
came along with a strong recommendation that the station
use the sporteaster the E.C. wanted,

The present controversy began when the I.C. carried on
a two-week debate last Spring on whether or not to pay salaries
to the editors and business managers of the RtP and Calyx.

The hassle continued when someone on the E.C. men-
tioned earlier this year that the investigation would also deal
with the quality of the publications and the way the editors
are chosen,

The E.C.’s job is to allocate funds to the publications at
the beginning of each year. as required by the student body
constitution,

They should take the business managers at their word when
they present their hbudgets—we do have an honor system
here that allows us to trust one another, right?

If the publications run into a deficit, the Publications Board
has its own reserve fund—made up of publications profits,
not student body funds—to take up the slack. 4

The Publications Board also has the responsibility to
monitor the quality of the RtP and Calyx and to pick the
editors. If the F.C. thinks it can do a better job, they have
appeal power over all Publications Board decisions.

| would make the same suggestion to them that I would
make to everyone who complains about the quality of the
RtP, to everyone who has never spent 1-5 hours a day, four

days a week, thirty weeks a year putting out a regular
publication.
The suggestion is, take the damn job, Eliminate the

salaries and appoint your own editors, if you ean find them.
Put out a better paper, if you can get one of us to teach you
how. Stick your noses into an area you know little about,
if you can get used to the idea of putting in more extra-
curricular hours than most of you have ever dreamed of.

And do all this with no renumeration whatsoever,

If the idea seems a little radical and the E.C, is not ready
to take the job, to turn an independent newspaper into a house
organ, then why the investigation?

Possibly because except in the areas of public honor trials
and campus publications the E.C, has absolute power. Maybe
they want to find out what they will be getting into if they
decide to consolidate the power somew hat.

If they are not planning a takeover, which is probably

An afternoon

with Elizabeth

The following article by En-
tertainment Editor Gray Cole-
man is a compilation of com-
ments made at a seminar held
at the Trobadour Theatre, The
questions, and Miss Taylor’s
answers, should be interpreted
as paraphrases and not as direct
quotes.

Co He Bs

Last Thursday — November 11,
1976 — must go down in W&L
history as the day the movie-buffs’
prayers were answered. Elizabeth
Taylor, perhaps the last great
superstar produced by the Holly-
wood movie moguls in their gravy
days, appeared on the horizon.
In a seminar at the Troubadour
Theatre, she met the sons of the
Colonnade head-on. She came,
saw, and, by the end of the after-
noon, conquered all with her
humor and candor. Unversed as I
am in shorthand, this article in-
cludes but some of the subjects
considered in the informal ques-
tion-and-answer period.

Q: How is your acting approach
different on stage, as opposed to
sereen?

A: Well, actually, I have only
done one stage performance —
dramatic readings from Dr.
Faustus, where I primarily walked
around in a cloud of smoke. ...I
would like to do some more stage
material; perhaps I’m a bit too
lazy. But the continuity of re-
peated performances would be
fascinating.

Q: When you do the film ver-
sion of a play, how close are you
to the playwright?

A: In the case of Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof or Who's Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf, I didn’t meet Albee
or Williams until after the film’s
release. And, then, I was naturally
nervous. One always hopes for
approval from one’s mentors. But
in my new movie, A Little Night
Music, the writer was on the set
every day. Hugh Wheeler was de-
termined to make the rhetoric
perfect in every way, and this
often unnerved me. He disliked
every small mistake.

Q. You seem to avoid the “‘act-
ing rut” that other actresses en-
counter. Is this intentional, your
constant variety of characters?

A: I've never been in a rut...
(with a glance at her finance W&L
Trustee John Warner). After all,
variety is the spice... Next?

Q: What was your most chal-
lenging role and why?

A: Martha in Virginia Woolf, |
was in my early 30’s and had to
play a woman around 50. The chal
lenge came because of this dif-
ference in age, along with voice,
accent, walk, stance, etc. Makeup
just couldn't do it all. I was sv
afraid I'd be hung up in techni-
calities. For example, they wanted

me to take voice lessons to lower
the voice level. I didn’t want to
do this — I got 3 weeks to think
my voice down. They thought I
was crazy, but it worked.

Virginia Woolf is one of the
most fascinating plays of the past
20 years. You know, there have
even been rumors that Albee saw
his two lead characters as homo-
sexuals! This is so untrue, If a
forthright man such as Albee
meant to write about homosex-
ulas, he would never have used
a tricky device or disguise.

George and Martha are two
desperate lonely people who in-
vented a child and turn it into
the ultimate weapon. Theirs is
a love-hate relationship, deeply
touching and funny in several
parts, yet unbearably vicious, too.
The show was marvelous for me.
it was like diving into completely
different swimming pool.

Q: Where did he get those
characters?

A: I guess he must have met
hundreds of miserable people — |
haven’t you?

Comment by Al Gordon: There’s:
a famous rumor on this campus
that the male characters were
based on men he met at W&L |
during his stay here.

A: He didn’t mention it to me.

Q: Would you comment on the |
fairness of the Academy Award
system?

A: I'm all for them... I’ve got
two! If. you don’t have one, I
suppose, you tend to say it’s just
sentiment, or the other person
got it because they’re getting old,
or because the other movie made
more money. There are literally
hundreds of excuses used. All I
know is that I was pleased when
I won, and disappointed when I
lost. After all, it is the highest
accolade we can offer our peers.
And it is nice to receive.

Q: In your work, who did you
find the easiest to communicate
with?

A: Just one person? I couldn’t
say. There are too many people.
league and friend. But he was di-
Spencer Tracy was a great col-
abolical as well. On my close-ups,
he’d cross his eyes and smile!

Q: Are there any potential parts
you'd like to do?

A: I really don’t know. There's
no really burning ambition. But
if something were offered tomor-
row that was good and sparked
my interest, I'd certainly not say
no.

Q: What were your childhood
days like at MGM?

A: | loved it — total fantasy-
world, My first starving role was
with a horse, and | loved horses.
It was just being myself. In addi-
tion, my parents insisted that my

and state that the two articles
that appeared last week gave a
good perspective of the general
as well as personal aspects of
the station, Before any more con-
fusion results from the article
about Third Ear, | would like to
elarify that Jim Schakenback, not
Todd Tyson, is the program di
rector of Third Ear. There are a
few comments that were attribut

ed to Todd that were not totally
accurate, Most of the equipment
at WLUR is no more than two
years old and the remaining equip-
ment is no older than four years
old. In terms of equipment,
WLUR is much better off than
radio stations I have seen at uni-
versities that were ten times the
size of W&L. Our record library
is comprised of promotional
copies we receive at no cost from
the record companies, We do not
have a large enough budget to
make outright purchases on a
regular basis. For this reason, a

DJ at WLUR should be able to
incorporate established as well
as lesser known artists in his pro
gramming. A truly good progres
sive rock station does not stig
matize itself by playing Top
Forty progressive rock inces
santly. If that were not the case,
a computer would be the logical
choice for operations control on
all progressive rock stations. On
Third Bar, the personality of the
host is emphasized along with a
broad application of established
and less successful artists

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

An afternoon continued Generals’ surprise: Homecoming victory

(Continued from Page 2)
friends come from outside the
studio community, to keep me
from being too insulated.

But scripts and homework made
it like no childhood at all...a
long, hard day and night’s work.
And it was six days a week, then!
I did have one hour of fantasy
a day, though, and that was lunch
at the MGM commissary. You
never knew whether you'd be
sitting with Marjorie Main or
Clark Gable! The rest was hard
work, but we all did it, because
that is what we were being paid
for, as professionals.

Q: You have often expressed
your disappointment with Butter-
field 8, yet you won the Oscar for
it in 1960. Why?

A: Mike Todd, my late husband,
had made a “gentleman’s agree-
ment” with MGM that I could
stop acting after Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof. This supposedly ended
my contract there. Around a year
later, though, I accepted Cleo-
patra at another studio. MGM
promptly called, and threatened
to stop my career entirely if I
didn’t do this new script, Butter-
field 8. By this time, MGM was
really “morally corrupt.” So I had
to wait to do Cleopatra. I guess
this is why I resented that movie
so much.

Q: Do you fight often with the
movie establishment?

A: Not any more, since the
independents like Paul Newman
and myself have taken over. The
big studios don’t have the threat-
ening power they once did. But,
twenty years ago, I remember a
good case in point. It was Louis
B. Mayer’s birthday, and we were
all supposed to stand around the
table and sing “Happy Birthday”
to that horrid old man. Perry
Como said something other than
“Happy Birthday, though. He
was black-balled from the in-
dustry for 8 years...it’s good
that this can no longer happen.

Q: Do you like American tele-
vision?

A: It’s not like the old ones...
This movie has a message, though
like the others, it’s beautiful to
look at and the music is wonder-
ful. A Little Night Music is a play
with music, not a musical, and
it was brought to the screen with
that thought in mind.

Q: How did you, as a child
actor, manage to bridge the gap
to older roles?

A: I don’t know. Just lucky, |
guess. I moved to adult parts
quickly because I matured quick-
ly. I had no extended transitional
period.

Q: How seriously do actors and
actresses take critics?

A: I don’t read critics. I used
to, but it is so demoralizing. Some-
times, I don’t even go to see one
of my films, because somewhere
along the line, while shooting, I
realized there would be problems.

Q: Would you care to speak
about The Blue Birds?

A: I'd rather not. This Soviet-
American effort was to take a few
weeks on my part. It took seven
months.

Q: Do you often go to the
theatre or movies?

A: Unfortunately, I don’t have
the time. I would like to go to
them, because I do love drama
and motion pictures. But not these
“trend films” of today! Will Ajir-
port 60 be next? It has to end —
1 even think doing King Kong
twice is awful, because it was so
good the first time! Not to men-
tion Gone With the Wind! It’s all

Jaws, airports, godfathers, god-
mothers!
Q: Do you approach Shake-

spearian roles in a different way
from others?

A: I’ve only done one Shake-
spearian film — The Taming of
the Shrew. And I was terrified.
I was surrounded by a group of
marvelous Old Vie actors who
had been doing Shakespeare for
years. While I was the only
American, the only film “star,”
and I had the lead role! I simply
stuck to this theory — don't allow
yourself to be overawed by Shake-
speare and don’t lose your bold-
ness in attacking the character.

Q: One final question. Do you
like to jump into a new film im-
mediately after completing the
previous role?

A: No... I'd much rather jump
into a nice, hot swimming pool...

~The University Supply

By NED McDONNELL

NO ONE really knows what
caused it. Some football experts
have theorized that the Homecom-
ing crowd of five thousand scream-
ing fans combined with the fif-
teen beautiful ‘Queen’ contest-
ants at halftime may have been
the reason. But whatever the
truth may be, the Generals un-
doubtedly played three brilliant
quarters of football last Satur-
day. The team, however, did let
up a bit in the final quarter to
add an element of suspense to
the whole affair.

Seeminly unaffected by a norm-
ally demoralizing loss suffered
the previous week, Coach Me-
Henry’s boys entered the game in
top form to give Gettysburg Col-
lege a rude welcome on its first
visit to the South in thirty-seven
years by downing the yankee grid-
iron team, 28-20.

The contest opened with a
scoreless first quarter marked by
tough defensive play on the part
of the Generals. Although W&L
quarterback Ted Hissey only
handled the football for six
minutes in the second quarter,
he still managed to engineer a
devastating twenty-one-point
aerial barrage in collaboration
with Richard Wiles and Tony
Perry. Five and a half minutes
into the second quarter, after
Hissey had connected with Wiles
for a thirty-yard gain, running
back Raynard Scott plunged over
the center of the Gettysburg de-
fensive line for a one-yard touch-
down run. Two and a half minutes
later, after an exchange of
fumbles, Ted Hissey heaved a
fifty-five yard picture perfect
touchdown bomb to Richard Wiles
to open W&L’s lead to 14-0. With
just under three minutes remain-
ing in the first half Scott again
plunged one yard into the end
zone, capping a drive where His-
sey and the acrobatic wide-re-
ceiver, Tony Perry, teamed up
(with the aid of a defensice inter-
ference penalty levied against
Gettysburg) to pick apart the visit-
ing defense. Down 21-0, Gettys-
burg’s quarterback Robert Le-
Comte put together a last minute
touchdown drive. But G-burg
kicker David Stein failed to con-
vert the touchdown typifying the
agonizing frustration that Gettys-
burg faced in the first half.

W&L drew blood five minutes
into the third quarter when run-

ning back Greg Cash almost single-
handedly ran through Gettys-
burg’s defensive unit (Cash scored
on a five-yard run). The third
quarter closed with W&L ahead
28-6.

But, like Jimmy Carter, the
Generals nearly blew a big lead
in the home stretch. First of all,
with nine and a half minutes left
in the contest, G-burg halfback
Kirby Seott raced forty-one yards
to a touchdown. The two-point con-
version attempt failed so W&L
still had a commanding 28-12 lead.
That commanding lead became
more and more tenuous as the
seconds ticked away. At one point,
Gettysburg had a first and goal
situation on the Generals’ four
yard line. But the tenacious de-

fenive squad stifled the visitors’
offensive attack and held the on-
slaught at the one yard line. But
the yankee team would not give
as QB Robert LeComte chucked a

five yard TD pass to Jay Howell ©

with Kirby Scott running the two
point conversion to close the gap
to 28-20 with twenty-four seconds
left in the game. The Generals fell
on the onside kick and did a fine
job of running out the last six-
teen seconds.

Quarterback Ted Hissey led the
offense for W&L by completing
fifteen of twenty-seven passes for
two hundred seventy-three yards.
Receivers Richard Wiles and Tony
Perry gained one hundred fifty-
nine and seventy-four yards re-
spectively through the air. The

Water polo a success

By ROBERT LYFORD

Imagine a Washington and Lee
fall sports team finishing second
in the state, and you'll probably
be accused of having one too
many glasses of grain, at least
if you express your fantasy. But
the W&L Water Polo team did
just that (no, they didn’t fanta-
size, finishing second in the state
behind the University of Rich-
mond. And water polo isn’t even
a varsity sport here yet?

Under the helm of Coach
Stearns, athletes have been re
cruited from P.E. classes, as well
as from our fine Swim Team. In
lacking varsity status, however,
W&L water polo players are not
only deprived of recognition but
presently do not receive gym
eredit for their efforts. Further-
more, non-varsity status restricts
their schedule and discourages
potential participants.

Nevertheless, Coach Stearns
has generated incredible enthusi-
asm in this fast action, finesse-
oriented game. Lead by captains
Tad Van Leer, and high scorer
Bill Greg, the team posted an im-
pressive 6 and 1 record losing
only in the finals of the State
Tournament. Though All-Stater
Van Leer is a senior, along with
Clay Preston, the remainder of
the team include freshmen Scott
Duff, Biff Martin, Bob Newcomb,

Drew Pilsbury, and John Woods.
Upper class returnees include
sophomore All-Stater Keith
Romich as well as “Bullet” Bob
Marin, a junior. Goalie Bill
Meyers, who is the initiator of
the team’s drive for varsity status,
will also be returning. Apparently
there were also other contribu-
tors who did not cherish Coach
Stearns’s 3,000-yard-a-day swim
“warm-up” but participated reg-
ularly in team scrimmages. As a
result there’s a firm base of
competitors interested in making
next year’s team-—and who knows,
maybe there’s an O. J. Simpson-
like water polo player roaming
Big Lex, who, like the rest of the
campus, doesn’t even know W&L
has a water polo team.

So water polo isn’t officially a
varsity W&L sport? Considering
its current succes and future po-
tential, water polo should be a
welcome addition to the W&L
varsity sports program.

for the win ought to be given to
