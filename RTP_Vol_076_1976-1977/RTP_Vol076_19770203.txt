Honor case ended;

grievances remain

By HALE DELAVAN

This is the first half of a
two-part article on the contro-
versy surrounding the recent
honor trial of a black student
and the complaints from the
Student Association for Black
Unity.

Much of this report is based
on interviews with members of
SABU. Details of honor trials
are hard to get from the E.C.,
even in such a well-publicized
incident, because of the White
Book stipulation that a trial is
private until a public honor
trial is held.

Junior Raynard Scott learned
of his impending honor trial be-
fore the E.C. on Jan. 17. The trial
was held the following evening
from 7 pm. to midnight. Scott
was represented by two law stu-
dents, Johnny Morrison and Eu-
gene Perry, and Assistant Dean
of Students Curtis Hubbard sat
in as an observer.

One source close to the E.C.
said later that Hubbard’s presence
was unprecedented for an honor
trial, but that the E.C. wanted
to avoid any claims of racism on
their part at a later date.

A SABU spokesman said the
atmosphere of the trial was un-
professional and the E.C. mem-
bers were uncourteous to the
accused. A member of the E.C.
said later that apologies were ex-

SNu fire spurs
IFC inspection

By REX NYQUIST

A fire last month at the Sigma
Nu house has led to safety in-
spections of all fraternity houses
by the Inter-Fraternity Council.
An IFC inspection committee be-
gan the checks last week and will
inspect three houses a week.

The Sigma Nu house suffered
minor damage in mid-January
when a support beam beneath
the living room fireplace caught
fire because the asbestos pad
under the fireplace had deteriorat-
ed, Fortunately, smoke alarms
detected the fire and the fire
department was quickly called to
put it out. Sigma Nu President
Joe] Mohrmon estimated damage
at about $1000-$1500.

The IFC established the inspec-
tion committee after the fire was
brought to its attention. By bring-
ing existing defects to the at-
tention of each fraternity house,
the IFC hopes to prevent similar
fires in the future.

The committee will examine the
struetare and exterior premises of
each house, and check the condi-
tion of walls, floors and windows.
The heating, water and electrical
systems will also be studied for
defects.

The IFC is also considering the
purchase of smoke detectors for
those houses which may want
them. Aceording to IFC President
Alfred Robinson, detectors will
probably be mandatory for fra-
ternity houses in the future.

tended from both sides following
the trial, which ended when Scott
told the E.C. he would withdraw
from the university rather than
face any more of what he con-
sidered unfair treatment from the
E.C.

The next morning some twenty
members of SABU came to Dean
of Students Lewis John’s office
to complain about the trial. Dur-
ing the previous night they also
deided to bring up other griev-
ances that, according to SABU
president Mike Brooks, have been
pending since 1971.

The students were referred to
President R. E. R. Huntley and
remained in his office until 8 p.m.
They were prepared to stay all
night. They left when the E.C.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 3, 1977

 

Ambassador Talcott W. Seelye

Ambassador speaks on Africa,

Lebanon in Contact speeches

“U.S. interests in southern Africa
are no different than they are
anywhere else in the world” said
Ambassador Talcott W. Seelye last
Monday night in Lee Chapel.
“Those goals are to point out the
interdependence of nations and
seek peace and stability,” said
the former Ambassador to Tu-
nisia.

This year’s second Contact
speaker has served in a number
of State Department posts in-
volving Africa and the Mid-East.
Last June he served as a special
emissary to Lebanon for Presi-
dent Ford. He currently holds
the post of Deputy Assistant See-
retary of State for African Affairs.

According to Seelye, U.S. in-
terests in Africa were brought
to world attention after the fall
of the Portuguese empire in Mo-
zambique and Angola. Until that
time, Seelye said, it was felt that
Africa was the responsibility of
European nations.

Secretary of State Kissinger’s
last minute attempt to bring
black majority rule to Rhodesia
was seen es having little chance
of suecess by the black ruled na-
tions surrounding Rhodesia,
Seelve said. He said Kissinger con-
vineed Prime Minister lan Smith
to announce a plan to gradually
bring about black majority rule,
explaining the decision as an ex-

pression of Rhodesian self in-
terest.
Despite the holdup in the

negotiations at the Geneva con
ference which resulted from Kis-
singer's actions, Seelye sees sev-
eral positive factors.

Among these are the evolution
of the official Rhodesian position.
the fact that a negotiating effort
has been launched with both sides
agreeing that it is useful, a reali-
zaiion by moderate black nation-
alists leaders that negotiation and

This week’s Ring-tum Phi in-
view is with Chuck Rogers,
president of the College Re-
publicans, the largest extra-
curricular club on the WAL
campus.

By DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

ReP: What is the College Re
publican Club's objectice?

Rogers: The objective of the
Club is to expose students to Re
publican philosophy and give
them the epportunity to partici
pate directly in the political
process.

RtP: What plans does the Club
have?

Rogers: We are trying to ar-
range mixers with Mary Wash
ington, Randolph-Macon, Long
wood, Sweet Briar, and Southern
Seminary, both here and at their
schools. We are contacting sev-
eral influencial Republican lead
ers to come to W&L to present
the Republican philosophy. We
are also hoping that members of
the Club will aitend the CRF\
eonvention this weekend becaus:
it will better aequaint them with
state polities, dive them the op
portunity to meet several candi

not revolution is the course which
will bring them te power, the
British involvement in the negoti-
ations and the fact that the
United States is planning to con-
tinue its push in the area for
black majority rule.

Seelye said that black majority
rule will come soon in Rhodesia,
to be folowed by black majority
rule in Namibia, formerly South
West Africa, and eventually in
South Afriea.

Seelye differentiated between
the regimes in Rhodesia and South
Africa, saying the black leaders
consider the Rhodesian govern-
ment to be coloniai, with four
million whites making up only
four per cent of the population,
and the South African government
legitimate, with the apartheid
policy as the only issue. The four
million whites in South Africa
make up almost 25% of the
population.

Earlier in the day, Seelye spoke
to a small group in duPont Audi-
torium about Lebanon.

He said the Arab world needs
a free-wheeling zone like Lebanon,
with its free trade, open banking
policies and free-wheeling society,
to operate as a safety valve for
the Mid-East.

Seeive said the civil war in
Lebanon was due to political ten
sion incorporated into the Leb-
anese government by the French
when they left the area in 1946
“Maronite Christians. then a ma-
jority of the populalion, were te
hold the president's office, while
Moslems would hold the Premier-
ship. The Christians are no longer
the majority, but the traditional
method of government has held

Tensions were exacerbated by
the presence of Palestinian lib
eration forces in south Lebanon
and fighting broke out between
Palestinians and Moslems on one

daies for Republican nomination
to state offices, and also have a
good time.

RIP: Speaking of the College
Republican Federation of Vir-
ginia: there has been talk of some
disagreement between the W&L
Republican Club and the CRFV
What about this?

Rogers: The CRFV believes the
hasic emphasis of a college Re-
publican movement is to get
people working in the campaigns
We believe the first requisite of
getting people in the campaign is
to get more people in the clubs
ind establish new clubs, and then
to involve those people in cam

paidns. The bie difference is one
of priorities
In the past three years, the

CRVF has not fulfilled its obliga
tions in either membership or
campaign due to ineffective lead
ership. This vear things have im
proved slightiv for the college
iepublicean movement, partially

because of the increased role
WAL has taken in establishing
new clube and helping other
clubs in the state

side and the Christians on the
other. The Army, split almost in
half along religious lines, was not
able to stablize the situation.

In January 1976, the Syrian
Army moved into Lebanon in an
effort to bring peace to the area.

Since then, Seelye said he has
seen some improvement in the
situation. He said the Palestinians
realized they could not win against
the Syrian Army and began to
negotiate, the Lebanese Moslems
began cooperating with the Maro-
nite Christians again to remove
the Syrian invaders and that the
Svriens have the power to pre.
vent either the Christians or the
Moslems from becoming too
strong in the immediate future.

Cross gets blood

Despite a high rejection rate,
the W&L Blood Drive exceeded
its 125-pint goal by nine pints
last Thursday.

According to Bill Kerr, organiz-
er-at-large for the College Re-
publicans, at least 165 people
showed up to give blood. With
an average rejection rate of 10
per cent for donors, the 31 turned
away represents almost double
the normal rate.

Several Red Cross nurses at the
drive atiributed the large nur-
ber of rejections to colds.

Zeta Beta Tau won the keg of
heer offered to the fraternity with
the highest turn-out. Sixty-four
per cent of its members showed
up.

Corky Devilbiss of the Colleg>
Republicans and John Martin of
Sigma Chi were co-coordinators of
the drive.

 

RtP: The W&L Republicans are
not accustomed to losing. How did
the result of the presidential
election affeet the Club?

Rogers: It was a big disappoint
ment, but both Byrd and Buller
won. The facet that the Demo
erats are running the national
government is giving people more
incentive to elect Republicans to
state office. Now, the Democrats
will earn the eredit for what

the ones to blame for what goes

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Division
of power

Proposition: The creation of a separate and autonomous
Honor Court for the sole purpose of hearing honor cases.

One of the really marvelous features of the Constritution
of the United States is the division of government into separate
branches. The idea, of course, is that no branch will be more
powerful than the others; this is achieved through the mutual
checks and balances exercised by each branch upon the others ;
Thus the government is designed to regulate itself, prevent-
ing, in theory, the overstepping or misuse of power,

At Washington and Lee, no such division of power exists.
The Executive Committee exercises not only executive but
also legislative and judicial authority, ineaning in effect that
it writes, interprets and enforces its own regulations. While
it is true that the members of the E.C. are freely elected, it is
also true that once elected, they are free to use their extensive
powers however they see fit.

This might not seem so bad. We are not, after all, an im-
mensely powerful nation—only a small college community
without real problems or issues, The single-branch system
has worked pretty well for a long time. In fact, compared to
tnany other college governments in the region, the E.C. is
the very model of efficiency.

Yet there is room, even the need, for improvement, Recent
events have raised an important question: To whom is the
iC. answerable when accused of violating its own rules? The
answer, under the present system: Only to itself,

To counter the dangers inherent in such an unregulated
system, I propose the creation of an Honor Court, a separate
‘undicial branch of govrnment with the responsibility of hear-
ing all honor cases. The potential value of moving to such
4 system is great. If one shares the assumption that the
principles of honor are the most important principles under-
living the entire University community, then one should
consider this proposition seriously and carefully.

The hearing of honor cases would be the sole responsibility
of the Honor Court, Free from outside influences and other
(read: political) considerations, the Court could guarantee
impartiality in all deliberations. Furthermore, should questions
ol procedure arise, they could be submitted to the ELC. for
review, circumventing the lack of regulation which comes with
self-regulation.

| do not propose to spell out in detail the man) aspects
and problems of the Court's creation and composivion, Cer-
tainly, it would require extensive consitutional changes, One
feature | would-advoeate is a rotating membership w hereby
students are called upon to serve limited terms on the Court
in such a manner that greatest possible number of students
would have the opportunity to serve at least once during Useir
college careers. This would yenerate greater
familiarity with the Honor System among students and henee
possibly reduce the number of honor violations.

There is much to be said about this idea, .\ student
referendum is in order, If you have thoughts on the subject,
vet them down on paper and send them to us. If sufficient
interest is generated, 1 will respond and formulate more de-

By M. GRAY COLEMAN
Entertainment Editor

Leonel L. Kahn arrived at W&L
in 1965 to assume the job of pro-
fessor of drama; his reflections
on that period are perhaps the
best insight into what this aera
of fine arts was like, little more
than ten years ago. When he
came, it was known as the Trouba-
dour Theatre, and was more of
a “club” than anything else.

“There were a few people who
did shows as a group — campus
night musical things, and then
some really good dramatic works,”
commented Mr. Kahn. “But the
the entire program was certainly
not geared to the education of
anyone in theatre in depth.”

Obviously, in such a set-up, a
major in drama was unheard of —
as a matter of fact, the catalogue
from the year of Mr. Kahn's
arrival shows a grand total of
4 drama courses (one term each
of acting, design, directing, and
theatre history), as opposed to the
14 or so courses offered today.
There were only two shows each
year, one for each semester.

But, the worst facet of all—the
thing that gave the drama de-
partment the “clubbish” reputa-
tion that it is still trying to
beat down—was the audition sys-
tem. Until the mid-sixties, it’s
pretty hard to say just what the
exact system was; they were
either by invitation or ‘“semi-
closed,” tending to make the
Troub even more isolated.

“One of the first things I did
upon. arriving at Washington and
Lee was to throw the audition
system wide open to all comers,”
said Kahn. “I remember when
word got around the Troubadour
what the new teacher was going
to do. A deputation of the present
actors, etc., arrived at my house

- late one night—and told me that

this move would totally destroy
the theatre! But I felt that a
chance had to be taken for the
benefit of the liberal-arts phil-
sophy of this university.” And,
to be truthful, the opening of
auditions did indeed destroy the
Troubadour Theatre Club—it was
on its way to becoming an honest-
to-God drama department.

Another event which may be
considered a benchmark in the
department's history would be the
production of Marat-Sade in 1968.
In the 1960's, it goes without
saying that fraternities were, to
put ii mildly, the absolute dicta-
tors of student affairs. For a long
time, those people interested in
drama had allowed themselves to
turn inward, until they were a
sort of fraternity, too. The fact
that there was little or no cross-
over between these ‘two worlds’
limited the manpower of the
theatre greatly. But, then came
Marat-Sade, a very experimenta!
show that needed a large cast.
It was at this point that they
succeeded in getting some fra-
ternity members to participate.

The show was a tremendous
suecess, one of the first educa
tional theatrical productions of
the show in the entire country—
and the theatre never lacked for
manpower from that time. So,
progress continued to be the
watchery of the theatre; this is
best shown by a very quiet transi-
tion that occured in 1972. The
Troubadour Theatre was officially
renamed the University Theatre,
and Mr. Kahn and his colleagues
had given W&L an open depart-
ment in name as well as in spirit.

The purpose of the new depart-
ment was to expand in quantity,
while retaining the quality which
had marked most of the Trouba-
dour Club shows. This meant
several new courses: an added
term for the areas ofacting, di-
recting, and theatre art; courses
in makeup, stage, and costume
design; and most recently, styles
courses which give the student
an indepth look at a certain facet
of theatre craft.

\ major step forward was taken
with the creation of “total
theatre.” Mr. Kahn comments:
“When the University announced
plans for the creation of a shori
term for the areas of acting. di-
the chance to create a course like
this. Total theatre allows us to
establish a company attitude: in
the six weeks we have one group
ef people who do everything. as
opposed to the usual show-by
show arrangement.” The total
theatre students have presented
such shows in the past as

Othello, The Tempest, and Peer
Gynt.

Drama 202, supervised study
abroad, allows the student to see
what’s going on outside the local
area. London is the focus of
these operations; there is more
there in terms of quantity and
quality (such as the National and
Royal Shakespeare companies)
than anywhere else.

So, the theatre, like the other
areas in fine arts, is in a period
of transition—progress has come,
but there is certainly a long way
to go. One thing that the faculty
would like to see is an increase
in the visit of professionals in
the field. Some steps in this area
have been taken already; the
Polish mime company which per-
formed here earlier in the year
is réturning to teach for several
weeks this term as part of the
Drama 140 styles course.

Another new concept being in-
troduced is a new type of senior
thesis—in play writing, along
with the original specialties in

acting, directing, or scenic design. .

Already, some beginning is being
made in this area; two one act
plays by sophomores John Jacob-
sen and Taylor Harbison will be
produced this March.

But often, educational theatre
is only so good as the facilities
it provides—and it is here that
the drama department faces its
biggest needs and challenges.
Things were once worse, if that
ean be imagined; in the mid-six-
ties, there was no lobby, no heat,
no makeup rooms or faculty
offices, and no workshop. Mr.
Kahn's first office was a small
glass cubicle. located somewhere
off stage right. and probably
bought at a Centel telephone-
booth sale. Actors sat on the
steps offstage, in costume, and

waited there for their cues. The
“auditorium” was composed of
wooden chairs on a flat wooden
floor--and so forth. Since then,
a shop has been added on, as
with the lobby, and the upstairs
was converted into new office
space and dressing roms. And
now, the Boiler Room appeared
this year, to supplement the
Troubadour as a second facility.
Yet, it certainly isn’t the light at
the end of the tunnel. “It gives
us, primarily another performing
area and more space for re-
hearsal—in addition to an area
for arena style theatre produc-
tions,’ said Mr. Kahn.

Yet the real necessity remains
-~an all new theatre facility;
something that was built to be
a theatre, not a laundry room or
a horse stble. A new theatre, Mr.
Kahn pointed out, must be multi-
purpose above all, allowing pro-
scenium or thrust set productions;
an adequate workshop — no more
building your set on the stage or
in the audience area for lack
of space; and a classroom and
rehearsal room space. One thing
that the entire staff agree on
emphatically, is that this is ab-
solutely essential now, in these
years—not as some hazy, long-
term, pigeonholed plan. “We've
done about al lhere in the pres-
ent facility that is feasible.”

So many things such as musi-
cals (with the exception of a
1776, where we had a ready-built
area in Evans Hall), cannot be
staged where the department is
located now. Anyone who attends
the theatre regularly at W&L
should come out with two feel-
ings especially: admiration for
the ingenuity of the people who
have to work in this structure
(and even the word “structure”

is gilding the lily), and a great
hope that one day, they will be
able to enjoy a facility that is
worthy of them.

Lee Kahn is optimistic, though
-—-very optimistic. He says:
“People should remember what
drama is like now, and compare
it to twenty years ago. It’s a
wide-open place today; this is
the greatest step forward.
Whether you crave theatre work
as a vocation or as an extra-
curricular activity, is here for
you now. !’m not sure really how
much we should expand, for we
don’t want to betray the liberal
arts idea here. But, our quality
certainly has to be enhanced, and
the key to that now is a new
theatre building. After all, we’ve
Ss program all ready to put
in if.”

It’s true—all the department
really needs is a place to show-
case all the talent it already has:
from other members of the staff,
Ai Gordon and Tom Ziegler (the
former is the C, B. DeMille of
W&L, who directed last year’s
inbulous 1776; the latter arrived
this year—and has already made
a name for himself with his
imaginative sets and publicity
“posters), to the steadily growing
number of majors themselves —
seven alone this year. It would
seem that the drama division re-
flects the state of the fine arts
as a whole, in its steady and sure
progress, adided by an administra-
tion anxious to put it at the
same quality level as Newcomb
or Howe Halls...

This concludes the Ring-tum
Phi’s investigation series on the
fine arts at W&L. Special thanks
for this series go to the Fne Arts
faculty, whose cooperation made
it all possible from the beginning.

Troubadours score with
Virginia Woolf production

By RICHARD S. WOLF

The University Theatre is offer-
ing its third major production of
the year this week with a pre-
sentation of Edward Albee’s
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.
This contemporary American
drama is undoubtedly the master-
piece of Albee’s canon and as
such, is a very difficult play to
pull off. I must admit that T was
a bit sceptical -when I entered
the Troub, but these apprehen-
sions were soon dispelled. This
production is nothing lass than
superb and was a delight to ex
perience. | would even go so far
as to say that this is the finest
production that I have seen on
the W&L stage.

Senior drama major Brian
Garr had the ambition to under-
take the direction of this play
for his thesis work. His under-
standing of Albee’s intentions and
his handling of them is con-
sistently good throughout the
production with few excepiions.
There is so much going on in this
play and so many themes that are
developed that Ht is a herculean
task to even keep them all
straight. Garr comes very close
to perfection with his develop-
ment of the major points of the
play, but there is one theme that
deserves more attention. For all
of the hate and injury that Georce
and Martha heap upon each other,
there is a basis of deep love
that underlies their entire relat
ionship. This point was certainly
not ignored by Garr, but it should
have been developed to a greater
degree in the first act instead o!
emerging unheralded in the third
act. For it is George's love and
concern fer Martha that catses
him to undertake his most hostile
acts to exorcise her of the illusion
that is keeping them apart. The
love hate relationship of the two
leads is central to the entire
play and should have been dea!
with more fully.

One of the major obstacles in
doing Virginia Woolf at a college
level is finding actors that can
eonvineingly portray the middic
agedness of George and Martha
This is really central to their
viability as characters who exude
billerness and = world-wearine
\fki they cannal be convincing!

portrayed by twenty year-olds
with frosted haid and lots of
lines drawn on their faces.
Happily, Brian Garr did not at-
tempt this, but rather cast his
play appropriately. W&L fine arts
director Al Gordon played George
to Suzanne Dieckerman’s Martha.
Ms. Dieckman is the director of
theatre at Southern Sem and even
though she is certainly not near
Martha’s ‘iftyish’, she was suf-
fieiantiy stuffed into her jump-
suit to convince us that she was
not a co-ed. Both of these actors
performed admirably and were
able to develop and sustain the
level of emotion and tension that
a successful performance of their
roles demands. I was particularly
impressed by Professor Gordon
who proved that he could go
beyond the mere character work
of his role in an earlier production
this year. Uncle Vanya.

Paut Morella and Caroline
Cromelin both did very well as
Nick and Honey, though I felt
that the latter came on a bit

strong in her early scenes. These
are very difficult roles to play as

they can easily be drowned out
by the intensity of George and
Martha. But both Morella and
Cromelin were able to sustain
enough presence to succeed in
their characterizations

LETTERS TQ THE EDITOR

Dear Sir:

I detect a strong attitude on
campus, particularly among the
members of the Student Activi-
ties Board, that goes something
like this: “O.K., we've satisfied
that half of the student body
which prefers rock music with
our winter concert, so now we
will have to satisfy that half
which prefers soul by having a
soul band for our spring concert.”
I find this attitude wrong in two
important respects.

First of all, | don't believe that
the student body is divided fifty-
fifty on the issue. I think that a
marked majority of W-L’s stu-
denis would prefer rock to soul

Generals’ twin victories
earn them top ODAC seed

By ROBERT S. BATES and
J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The W&L basketball team con-
tinued its winning ways last week
by taking two ODAC conference
games. On Tuesday night the Gen-
erals traveled to Farmville to take
on the always tough Hampden-
Sydney Tigers. The Generals lost
an earlier meeting to the Tigers
and were determined this time to
come back vietorious.

‘The game started off fast with
both teams hitting their first
four shots. From that point on,
the game emerged into a seesaw
battle with the lead changing
hands a total of 23 times. Late in
the second half the Generals
were up by as many as nine
points, but were not able to hold
off a late Sydney surge as the
Tigers cut the General lead to
two. The fourth quarter chant of
“Go to hell, Generals” did little

to unnerve the Generals. With
five seconds remaining in the
game and the score tied, Chris

Larson calmly canned a fifteen
footer icing the game for the

Local resorts

beckon skiers

By REID SLAUGHTER

If there is one good thing
zbout the chilling weather of late
it is that along with the low
temperature comes snow, and
that means some of the best ski-
ing in Virginia in the last five
years.

With the conditions good, ski
fever has hit the campus of W&L
and hundreds of students are
taking off for the slopes each
week. There are three good re-
sorts, all fairly close to here, that
deserve mentioning:

Massanutten—-Five miles north
of Harrisonburg on 81, Massa-
nutten Ski Village has the most
to offer. It has nine different
runs, night skiing (til 10:30,
Tues.Sat.), and excellent restaur-
ant/warming house faeility, and
competent ski school instruction.
The best deal here is to join P.E.
167 and ski for credit, as you get
six two-hour lessons and six half-
day lift tickets for only $39.00
($21.00 if you have your own
skis).

Homestead — About 50 miles
west of Lexington, The Home-
stead is located in Het Springs.
Although it has one of the nicest
hotels you'll find anywhere, the
skiing leaves a bit to be desired.
Without the excellent snow-mak-
ing equipment of Massanutten,
there is a surplus of ice.

The Uomestead does have a
lot more than skiing. It has very
good ice skating facilities, and
other mountain activities such as
tobogzaning and bobsledding are
available

Snowshoe—-Farther off in Slaty
Fork, West Virginia, Snowshoe is
about a three-hour drive from
Lexington. This is the place to go
for a weekend, as there is a
dormitory on top of the mountain,
along with live bands on the
weekend, and plenty to do.

With plenty of rvom to ex:
pand, Snowshoe already has more
runs than either Massanutten or
Homestead, and is geared more
for the intermediate to advanced
skiers. The facilities are superb,
and the ski instructors very able.

This is a big year for the ski
industry afier near disaster last
year when high temperatures
melted what little snow there was.
Consequently, there are more and
more new or beginner level skiers
out to whom the following “hints”
are e#iven

(1) Take lessons. No matter how
good you may think you are, you
can always polish up with a les
son, There are lessons at ood
prices for every level skier. Take
advantage of them

(2) Warm up on an easy slope

t iret. Your legs need a chance
to get loose in skiing just as in
any other sport

(3) When you begin to get
tired, stop. 80°. of all injuries

occur in the last hours and a half
of the skiing day

exuberant Generals (76-75).

One of the keys to this game
seemed to be the Generals’ ability
to maintain their poise and stick
to their game plan. Another big
factor was the Generals’ inability
to convert from the charity line.
Coming into the game, the Gen-
erals were the leading free throw
shooting team in Division I. As
a team, they shot only 59% com-
pared to their seasonal 79%.

The Generals as a team out-re-
bounded Sydney 46-20. High scor-
ers for the game were Pat Dennis
and Bob Flint with 23 points
each. By virtue of their victory
over HS, The Generals have: just
about insured themselves of the
top seed in the first ODAC tourna-
ment, coming up later this month.

On Saturday afternoon W&L

played host to the Bridgewater
Eagles. This was not what you
call one of your classical match-
ups. By halftime the Generals
had a comfortable 54-29 lead and
were in total command of the
game. At this point it seemed
as if the only thing in doubt
was whether the Generals were
going to hit the century mark for
the second time this season. But
this was not be! The team play in
the second half was ragged and
resembled a comedy of errors.
Poor passing, numerous turn-
overs, and erratic shooting led to
a disappointing 94-76 final. Pat
Dennis again led all scorers with
25 points, nineteen of which came
in the first half. Dennis is now
averaging 20.3 points per game,
and shoting a phenomenal 58%

from the field. Don Berlin played
one of his finest all around games
of the year scoring 19 points,
and Jeading the team in rebounds
with 10. In all, five Generals
seored in double figures, which is
enough to make any coach happy.

With eight regular season
games remaining, the Generals

need six victories in order to top
the 29 victory level for the second
time in their 51 year history, and
also for coach Vern Canfield to
obtain his 200th career coaching
vi tory. With a winning percent-
age of 875 (third best in Di-
vision Til), W&L is ranked 15th
nationally.

W&L’s next game is tonight at
home against Shenandoah Col-
lege, and Saturday with Virginia
Wesleyan.

Indoor track season begins;
coach and team optimistic

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

W&L’s track team begins its
indoor season Saturday, Feb. 12
with a tri-meet at Lynchburg. The
indoor season is considered by
coach and team as a warmup for
the outdoor season, which begins
in March.

Commenting on this year’s
team, Coach Norris Aldridge said,
“Overall, this year’s team is
stronger than past teams in previ-
ous years. Our strong areas have
John Tucker in the quarter mile;
Paul Thomson—half mile; Tony
Perry—high jump; and Phil Dun-
lay—shot put and 35 Ib. weight.”

Continuing, Aldridge said Larry
Banks, a four-year letterman who
shares the school record in the
440 relay, is the team’s top
sprinter. Sophomore Norvell
Scott has a good chance to break
the school record in the high
jump, long jump, and hurdles.

Aldridge doesn’t think the team
has many weaknesses, except for
lack of depth in some areas,
particularly the distances. He

concedes that W&L may have
some trouble in the one mile,
three mile, and hurdles, but ex-
presses confidence in Allen Weeks
and Richard Bird for the one mile,
Mike Burns (who holds the school
record in the two mile) for the
three mile, and Scott in the
hurdles.

In talking about his competi-
tion in the ODAC, Aldridge said,
“The ODAC is a pretty balanced
league, especially indoors. Once
we move outdoors Bridgewater
should emerge as the dominant
team, especially in the track
events. W&L should finish at least
2nd in the ODAC and should set
some marks in the field events.
It is coneeivable that we could
finish first, despite a strong
Bridgewater team, but a lot de-
pends on our avoiding injuries
and our freshmen producing for
us.”

As Aldridge indicated, one of
W&L’s strong areas is the field
events, especially the weight
events (shot, discus, ete.). Much

of the success in this area can
be attributed to assistant coach
Bill Hansen, a third-year law stu-
dent.. Hansen has put his boys
through an extensive training pro-
gram including weightlifting, run-
ning, and throwing in the spec-
ialties.

Their efforts paid off last year
as team members consistently
placed in the shot, 35 Ib. weight,
and the javelin. This year, the
venerals will have to do with-
out javelin thrower Jack Berry's
talents, but should make up for
the loss in the other categories.

Sophomore Phil Dunlay is ex-
pected to take up much of the
slack. Though not a javelin
thrower, Dunlay could perhaps be
the best weight man in the
ODAC. He already holds the state
small college record in the 35
lb. weight, and is close to break-
ing the school record in the shot
(48°9"). In practice this year
Dunlay has thrown 45’. Last year.
he set a record every time he

Wrestlers defeat H-S, 43-2,
then disappointed at state meet

By KENNETH SMITH

The Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team must feel like a
mountain climber who, upon
reaching the top of mountain,
suddenly loses his balance and
falls back down. The wrestlers
reached the peak last Wednesday
night defeating fellow ODAC
member Hampden-Sydney 43-2.

The facts speak for themselves.
For the Generals Mike Deighan
pinned at 134 Ibs. Ed Johnson

pinned at 142 Ibs. Ray Gross
pinned at 150 Ibs. and Tom
Oxendine at 177 lbs. scored a

major decision winning 17-1. Of
course W&L did have its share
of tough matches. Ed Rodgers did
well to gain a 1-1 draw against

llampden-Sydney's best wrestler
and Jim Crytzer wrestled well to
record a 7-3 decision.

Perhaps the most exciting
mateh of the evening was the
last one between the heavy-
weights. Dan Kniffen battled his
opponent evenly throughout the
entire match and with time run-
ning out it leoked like he was
going to have to settle for a
draw. But with only five seconds
left he scored two points on a
— down and won the match
9-7.

Of course, Hampden-Sydney is
by no means a wrestling power-
house but it was good to see that
the Generals wrestled well in roll-
ing to their third dual meet vie-
tory of the year. Furthermore it
seemed a good match, a confi-
dence builder, on which to pre-
pare for the upcoming Virginia
State Meet.

Three days later the Generals
were at the University of Vir-
ginia for that meet which lasted
from eleven in the morning until
about ten at night. Upon enter-
ing the U. Hall (as the students
there call it) one was impressed
with its size. Inside were four
big numbered mats with coaches
and wrestlers streaming around
the floor or filling the stands.
The meet officials were every
where with pads containing lots
of notes on weight classes and
times. Referees and wrestlers
found themselves in strange con
torted positions in this four ring
circus with whistles blowing.

one match the referee was almost
under two wrestlers, his arms
flailing about to see if the man
was pinned. All of sudden a
female official threw a rolled up

Hesse trial ended: SABU grievances remain

decided to meet on the question
of whether to take the unusual
step of retrying the honor case.

Following the E.C. decision to
rehold: the hearing Brooks went
to Richmond on Jan. 22 to confer
with the executive secretary of
the Virginia branch of the
NAACP, Jack Gravely, to explain
Scott’s story and ask for the
organizations’ assistance.

Gravely visited W&L the fol-
lowing day and also wrote to E.C.
President Tom Hunter expressing
his support of Scott’s position,
according to Brooks. SABU is still
seeking NAACP aid in research-
ing the legality of the E.C. actions
in this case, according to Brooks,

but the matter is not getting the
organization’s full attention be-
cause of a situation at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

The NAACP is currently in-
volved in a case at U.Va. where
the black head of the honor com-
mittee has been asked to resign
by his colleagues because of
charges of inattention to his job
and threats to fellow committee

members.
The gentleman in question
charges that the complaints

against him are racially oriented.

On Jan. 25, Scott was retried
and found guilty by the E.C. He
did not attend the trial and de-
cided following it to ask for a
publie trial before a student jury.

Let’s have another Spinners War!

(Continued from page 2)
If a poll were taken which com-
pared the number of people who
preferred soul to heavy metal
rock, country rock, laid back rock,
or jazz rock, soul would come
out ahead with respect to each of
the other specific categories. But
if a poll were taken to compare
the number who preferred soul -
to rock in general, I’m convinced

that the vast majority would
prefer rock.
Secondly, I don’t think that

W-L’s rock fans were “satisfied”
with the winter concert. I attend-
ed the show and I enjoyed it. But
the three bands that played were
virtual no-names. The S.A.B. did
an excellent job of promoting
and putting on the show, and
drew a large crowd. But I doubt
very seriously that any of the
W-L students who attended would
have travelled to Roanoke or
U.V.A. to see the same concert.

from rock of a comparable
stature to the Spinners in soul
would be someone along the line
of the Who, the Eagles, or Bob
Dylan. Obviously ARS isn’t to be
compared with these acts. Just
as obviously the S.A.B. could
never afford them. But the point
is that the rock fan at W-L isn’t
completely satisfied, and would
very much like to see other bands
from other fields of rock.

The trial was set for Feb. 1.
According to Brooks, SABU hoped
to buy time to enlist NAACP
aid in bringing an injunction to
prevent further proceedings
against Scott; however, court
action was made difficult by the
fact that the tape of the original
hearing had been destroyed, in
keeping with White Book regula-
tions in private cases.

The public trial was cancelled
when Scott decided to withdraw
from the university.

Next week the RtP will look
at the SABU complaints against
the university and what pro-
gress has been made following
the actions of the last few

“Virginia Woolf” review
(Continued from Page 2)

The realistic set design by Jim
Jones was well done and very
suitable for the production. The
great depth of the stage allowed
the freedom of blocking that is
vital to Virginia Woolf.

With this great succes under
its belt, the University Theatre
will move on to a production of
Bertolt Brecht’s Three Pneny
Opera. This play is in many re-
spects even more difficult to stage
than Virginia Woolf. But if di-
rector John Ellis can capture even
a bit of the professionalism of
the present production, he will do
quite well.

All this confusion may seem
very amusing or even bewilering
to the observer who does not
frequent such affairs, but for the
W&L wrestlers the meet brought
nothing but frustration. Coach
Franke went to Charlottesville
with hopes of placing some of his
wrestlers among the best in the
state, and of course, to give them
some good experience. No doubt
the team did gain experience, but
except for Jim Crytzer who placed
fourth in the 158 lbs. class, no
one else even won a match. If
they were not pinned, the Gen-
erals at least spent a great deal
of time on their backs counting
the lights on the ceiling.

“Of course I thought Jim
Crytzer and Ed Rogers should
have done a little better,’ com-

mented coach Franke. “But the
best wrestlers in the state were
here and at the very least we
gained some good experience.”
Still, how is it that the Generals
did not meet his expectations?
“Well, I think it was a combina-
tion of things,” Franke responded.
“Besides having to wrestle against
the best in the state, we were
a little flat, and we did not
wrestle as well as we could have.
We are a better team than that.”
On the whole, coach Franke
did not sound too upset about
the meet, perhaps because it had
no effect on the ODAC which he
still expects to win. Nevertheless
the Generals will have to re-
cover their balance and begin the
climbb ack up to the peak which
they had so recently achieved.

he is coming back from a back
injury and could have a record-
setting year in both events if he
stays healthy.

Dunlay also throws the discus
but that category is led by senior
Hank Phillips. Hansen on Phillips:
“Hank did a lot of work in the
off-season and is starting this year
10 lbs. heavier. He should set a
few marks in the discus.” Phil-
lips also holds 3rd place in the
state in the 35 lb. weight.

Other weight men_ include
senior John X. Miller, who com-
petes in the shot and discus;
and freshman Jamie Ryan, who
now throws the shot 40’ and could
possibly throw it 45’ by the end
of the season, according to Han-
sen.

Track is a tough sport in that
it demands much of a participant
both mentally and physically. It
is an individual sport in whieh
the man cannot depend on his
teammates tor help, but only on

his own dedication and determina-
tion.

ment he receives, the more de-

the only people to encourage the

mates. This year, coaches Ald-
ridge and Hansen and the team
hope more students will show
some interest in them, and come
out to cheer them on in their
quest for their first winning sea-
son in three years.
