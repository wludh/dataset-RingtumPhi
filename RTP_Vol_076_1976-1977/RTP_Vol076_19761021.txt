Constitution-vs.-rule duel
invalidates frosh election

A conflict between the Student Body Constitution
and the rules of the Voting Regulations Board (VRB)
has led the Executive Committee to rerun Monday’s
election for freshman E.C. representative.

The election for E.C. representative will be held
today in conjunction with the run-off between Casey
O’Malley and Dave Meyer for freshman president.

The E.C. decided to hold the election again after
hearing a complaint Monday night from Jay Blum-
berg, a candidate whose name was omitted from the
ballot in the general election.

Blumberg’s name was removed because he had
allegedly failed to obey the VRB rule requiring that
each candidate give the E.C. a pledged financial state-
nent the night before tahe election.

VRB chairman Bill Kerr said he did not find
Blumberg’s statement in the E.C. room Sunday night;
however, E.C. President Tom Hunter noted that a
couple of statements were found in the trash ean
and that Blumberg’s could have been lost.

The E.C. voted to held a second election today
based on Blumberg’s pledge that he had turned in
a Statement on Sunday night. Senior representative
Paul Larkin voted against the decision. Senior repre-
sentative Walt Kelley abstained and pointed out the
Constitutional reference to elections.

Kelley mentioned that the Constitution states
that any candidate who turns in a petition to the
E.C. will be placed on the ballot. The Constitution
makes no mention of financial statements. Kelley
argued that the E.C. was overstepping its bounds by
requiring the statments.

Larkin agreed, and arranged a special meeting
of the E.C. Tuesday night to discuss the issue.

At Tuesday night’s meeting the E.C. decided to
include on today’s ballot the names of all persons
who turned in petitions regardless of whether they
had presented financial statements. The motion pass-
ed unanimously.

Today’s ballot will include the names of the two
candidates listed Monday, plus Blumberg and three
other candidates who were stricken from the ballot
in the general election.

Candidates for freshman E.C. representative in-
clude Jay Blumber, Kevin Dickey, Andy Holds, Jacob
Jones (Monday’s apparent winner), Ray Nugent and

Kelley said the E.C. will#probably look into the
question of requiring financial statments from candi-
dates. The investigation will take place sometime in
the near future and will deal with the issue of
scrap the statements, write a constitu-
tional amendment or innovate.

Iron-jerkers get cash

By J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

The W&L Weightlifting Club,
will receive a $100 gift.

At the conclusion of the Spring
term last May, J. Michael Luttig
was awarded the Gilliam Award,
created in 1963 to honor Dean
Frank J. Gilliam, now deceased.
The award consists of a silver
bowl presented to the recipient,
plus $100 to a campus organiza-
tion or department named by the
recipient. The award is given on
the basis of service to the school
and the community, rather than
in consideration of need.

In a letter to the Exective Com-
mittee, dated September 1, 1976,
Luttig thanked the EC for the
award. He said that he thought
of the award “not in terms of
an honor or distinction, but rather
as a memorial to a man whose
contributions far transcend his
years.”

Luttig took the attributes of the
Dean into consideration before
selecting the Weightlifting Club.
Dean Gilliam excelled in athletics,
student government, and com-
munity affairs. Luttig felt the field
of athletics had been largely ig-
nored in the past by other
recipients, and the enthusiasm
with which the Weightlifting Club
members approached their activi-
ties impressed him. He cited fund
raising activities, expenditures
for new equipment, and the paint-
ing of the weightroom as _ ex-
amples.

The president of the club, Ed
Wick, said the club was honored
by the unexpected award. “It
came as a complete surprise. We
weren't planning on an extra $100.
I guess we will use it to further
enhance the weightroom with any
equipment the club wants to buy.”

For students unfamiliar with
the Weightlifting Club, it is
pledged “to act as a developer in
the physical well-being of mem-
bers of the W&L community.”

Membership is open to all pro-

vided that the individual displays
an interest in improving his or
her physique through the use of
weights and related exercises. The
club provides equipment, coach-
ing, and extracurricular benefits.

Wick said the club does nothing
for students not interested in
keeping in shape, but it is in-
valuable to students who are. Club
equipment can be used by stu-
dents if a club member is present.
By painting the weightroom and
at times providing stereo music,
club members have a more con-
genial atmosphere for workouts.
Carpeting the weightroom is the
next project, but the funds for

Trustees meet
in Philadelphia

W&L’s Board of Trustees will
meet this week in the same loca-
tion their predecessors did a
hundred years ago during the na-
tion’s Centennial — historic Inde-
pendence Hall in Philadelphia.

A ceremony tomorrow morn-
ing in the Long Gailery in Inde-
pendence Hail will mark the open-
ing of the regular autumn meet-
ing of the W&L board. The room
will be closed to the public for
the special Washington and Lee
event.

The university board met in the
Same place in October 1876 “to
organize a movement for the
better endowment” of the uni-
versity. it is because of that his-
toric connection that independ-
ence hail is being made available
to W&L to follow that precedent
on the lvvth anniversary of that
meeting.

After the commemorative cere-
mony in the Long Wailery, just
above the Assembly Room in
which the Declaration of inde-
pendence and later the Constitu-
lion were actuaily dratted and
adopted, the W&L board will con-
duct a business meeung in the
west wing of Independence huii.

The W&L Board's 18/6 meeting

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 21, 1976

“A Larger Issue”

Someone suggested that I attempt to engage the “larger
issues” at stake here at Washington and Lee without letting
ine in on just what those issues are. Oh well, it'll be more
sporting this way.

I do not propose to define the term “university”; many
weighty tomes have already been devoted to that task, Yet
it may not be invalid to draw some general conclusions about
the nature of the structure, the techniques, and the goals of
this university in particular. ;

The division of the university into colleges is in itself :
logical procedure, provided that the categories drawn are
themselves valid, Certainly it makes sense to group together
those disciplines or fields of study which are integrally inter-
related, In the undergraduate division, the college of arts and
sciences would seem upon first examination to cover about
everything; indeed, a more logical system might be to split
1) the
college of arts and humanities, including all fine arts (the

the undergraduates into the following two schools:

visual arts, music, theatre), classics, languages, history, Eeng-
lish, journalism and probably polities and sociology as well;
and 2) the college of the sciences, including all natural and
theorectical sciences, psychology, mathematics, economics, and
all other commerce-related fields.

What? you say. How can polities be separated from
economics arid commerce? Psychology from sociology? And is
not commerce an entirely distinct area, as contrasted with both

art and science?

Given the general mutual interrelatedness between all areas
of human study, as well as the many overlappings btween and
among those areas, it may be impossible to develop a perfectly
clear division of categories. Yet the one drawn above seems to
me not without a logic of its own. Politics, as a preparation
for law or public service, is clearly humanistic in nature, while
commerce and economics serve to prepare one mainly for
participation in business and private enterprise. Psychology,
while undeniably concerned with human feeling and_ self-
knowledge, purports itself to be a scientific discipline and
should hence not resist categorization with the sciences;
sociology again seems more actively concerned with the better-
ment or at least the understanding of human social behavior,
although it is often statistical or quantitiative in procedure,
if not if nature.

After these and perhaps a few other small quibbles have
heen thoroughly resolved, the matter would seem to me to be
at an end, and we might proceed to the matter of graduate
divisions. that is, the law school, Gladly would I do this, for
that seems to me a problem worth engaging, but there are
those who will, and feel they must, detain me.

What of commerce? ery my detractors, What of business,
of industry, of matters fiseal and financial? Is not the purpose
of the university to prepare its students (clients, they might
say) for life in the “real world,” where great corporations rule
the life of America?

The distinction lies between: 1) learning about a field in
whieh one has genuine interest and ability, the mastery of
which will enable one (hopefully, admittedly not necessarily )
to pursue an occupation which is both pleasurable and profit-
able: and 2) learning how to make money,

Even if the ethics program were to include business as an
vceupation, it would not justify the existence of an entire
college devoted to fulfillment of the profit motive,

Next week, unless diverted by the seandal of student apathy
over football or some other momentous tragedy, | will discuss
the relationship of the law school to the univ ersity,

Noted journalist attracted

By BILL THOMSON

Three weeks ago he went to
Chicago to investigate the Cen-
tral State Teamsters Fund. Two
weeks a go he was in lowa speak-
ing to a group of high school
political science and social stud-
ies instructors. Last Tuesday,
from his office in Reid Hall, he
gave a live interview with WRNG,
at Atlanta radio station. The
next day he flew to Atlanta for
radio and TV appearances and a
speech. In addition to his teach-
ing position at W&L, he is a
national correspondent for the
Des Moines Register and Tribune.
His weekly column deals with gov-
ernment and its operations from
(as he describes it) a “common
sense” view.

Clark R. Mollenhoff is the lat-
est addition to the teaching staff
in W&L’s journalism department.
A lawyer-journalist, he was a
Harvard University Nieman Fel-
low from 1949 to 1950, an Eisen-
hower Exchange Fellow from 1960
to 1961, and Deputy Counsel and
(later) Special Counsel to Presi-
dent Nixon from 1969 to 1970. An
“investigative reporter” long be-
fore the term became fashionable,
Mollenhoff has reported on local,
state and national government in
depth for about 35 years (25 of
those years have been in Wash-
ington, D.C.).

Mollenhoff has written eight
books in the past 15 years (seven
of which have sold around 10,000
to 20,000 copies. Game Plan for
Disaster, his report on the Nixon
years, and The Man Who Par-
doned Nixon, an account of Presi-
dent Ford’s destruction of his own
credibility, both came out in
1976.

“The F ord administration
doesn’t want to discuss the book,”
said Mollenhoff after his inter-
view with the Atlanta radio sta-
tion. “It’s to well-documented and
invulnerable to argument,” he

said. The weak criticism of the
book by the Ford administration
Mollenhoff said, is that there is
nothing new in the book. The
however,

Ford people do _ not,

Mollenhoff (r) confers with Prof. MacDonald

question the facts. The Man Who
Pardoned Nixon is selling well
in this election year; it is in-its
second printing now. Mollenhoff
said he is satisfied with all of his
books, and there is nothing in any
of them that he would change.
Why did Mollenhoff choose
W&L as the university where he
would like to teach?
“Washington and Lee is a fine

 

old educational institution,” he
said. The first time he saw the
Colonnade it impressed him as be-
ing comparable with the White
House, Phe Capitol and other
great American buildings. “Com-
pared to Washington and Lee,
Harvard looks like a factory.”
“It's a good, school, and it’s
small enough that I think I'll have
some impact on the students,’
said Mollenhoff. He stresses gov-
ernment operations in class and
emphasizes the importance of
examing fact situations in order
to arrive at basic, honest judge-
ments. He said that this is a
good ability for students to culti-
vate. “It helps you get to the core
issue, and then to dismiss ir-
relevent material,” he said. “This
analysis puts you in an informed
position from which you can moke
subsequent judgements.”

Mollenhoff, in addition to writ-
ing his column and teaching, is
currently working on a “couple of
investigative projects’ (one of
which is corruption in the Teamst-
ers Union).

He will be teaching at W&L for
a two year period to see how
it turns out. He said that he en-
joys teaching and, in the next
three or four years, would like to
phase himself out of “day-to-day”
journalism: and go into full-time
teaching.

And what does the author of
The Man Who Pardoned Nixon
think of the upcoming presi-
dential election? “Ford has been
wrong in a lot of cases. He doesn’t
want to face the facts,” Mollen-
hoff said. “But I'm not sure if
Jimmy Carter is a reasonable
alternative to Ford.”

etters to the Editor

An open letter
to the IFC

Dear Sirs:

The recent decision by the IFC
(more specifically the IFC social
chairman) to engage both the
Tams and the Drifters for the up-
coming IFC weekend is outrageous
The continued callous indifference
of this school’s student leaders to
the opinions of a large portion,
if not a majority, of the student
population (in this case the fra-
ternity population) concerning
matters of social entertainment is
astonishing, especially in light of
last year’s near riot in the E.C.
room concerning the same prob-
lem.

In case the reader is not aware
of the matter in question, I will
update: in last week's Ring-tum
Phi the IFC announced that they
had contracted for two bands to
play for IFC weekend—the Tams
and Sister Rose and her Brothers
(or whatever). Subsequently, the
1FC announced that Sister Rose
was unavailable, and as a replace-
ment, the Drifters were signed to
play the SAME NIGHT as the
Tams. (Thus it seems that the true
soul music addict requires re-
peated hits of soul music in order
to achieve complete aural satis-
faction.)

Again, I must express my total
amazement—and disgust—at the
continued lack of responsiveness
of the IFC and SAB to student
cisions; Le., one soul band and
one rock band. For the sake of
desires. Thankfully the SAB has
made progress in this area
through such means as student
opinion polls and compromise de-
fariness, the IFC should follow the
lead of the SAB and poll indi
vidual fraternity members before
making decisions concerning IFC
functions. Hopefully, such pro
cedures would prevent the recur
sions, Until such a time, those of
us who have grown tired of old
men in pink tuxedos will have to
suffer through one more perform
ance of the tired Tams and the
down-and-out Drifters

Stephen Good
Bill Craver
Bill Broders

This all leads one to wonder
whether last year’s IFC and
SAB potentates were indeed
granted a full pardon by their
successors for any and all
crimes committed while in
office. History is proving itself
to be cyclical, or at least re
cyleled.

Parking problems

Editor,Ring-tum Phi:

A peaceful Saturday night's
quiet and solitude gvas broken by
the loud tearing sound created
by the ripping of a car’s conver
tible top. In the pouring rain, the
vandal slashed a gaping hole in
the roof and proceeded in his at-
tempt to steal the car. If not for
the appearance of the security
guard, the attempt could have be-
come a reality.

A typical case of crime on the
streets which occurs most every
day in cities such as Richmond,
New York, Newark, and others.
What makes this event so shock-
ing, however, is the fact that this
act of vandalism (including the
ravishing of the auto) did nto
occur in any of those crime-ridden
cities, but on the freshman park-
ing lot on the W&L campus in the
small town of Lexington, Va. This
is not to place the blame on
Murph, for if it were not for his
timely appearance, the aborted
hot-wire attempt might have been
succesful. This is not, however,
the point of this letter.

The reason that an occurance
such as this is possible to happen,
should be apparant. It is due to
the irresponsibility of the ad-
ministration, and their refusal to
furnish further parking facilities.
It should also be noted that the
Sophomore parking lot, located to
the right-rear of Gilliam Hall, is
often close to empty. Therefore,
additional parking is available. It
is irresponsible to place a pak-
ing lot as far away from the
campus and in such an obscure
location, which lends itself to
mischief, as the freshmen park-
ing lot. It is probably true that
creating a new parking lot would
involve a large expenditure (and
take until the year 2001 to com
plete) however, the personal ex
penditure which will be incurred
by such acts make such a pro
posal manditory

In a school such as W&L, where
we pride ourselves in an honor
system where such acts of vand
alism are extinct, why should we
permit such acts by outsiders to
tarnish our good name and reputa
tion”

Michael M. Adams ‘80

And let's not ferget old
Woods Creek, scene of unmiti-
gated holocaust, where the last
report it was impossible to
drive, park, and even walk. The
open space which could have
served well as a parking lot
has been given over to a colony
of boviders, and the walkways

are rivers of mud. Chalk it up
to administrative foresight.

Richard revisited
Dear Sir:

Your editorial on the salaries
for publication editors and busi-
ness managers is to the point, in
that they should be paid. Few
people realize the hassles of try-
ing to meet deadlines, and the
hell that is caught when they are
missed. The issue is freedom, free-
dom from the meddling of the
Executive Committee into an area
about which they probably know
little if anything at all. The E.C.
should return to whatever it is
supposed to be doing and leave
the publications to the Publica-
tions Board. They should also re-
read their copies of the student
handbook. Congratulations to
Mark Richard for having the
strength of his convictions.

Respectfully Yours,

Harry Wright, IV, 80A
P.S. Perhaps you should table the
Ring-tum Phi until November.

lt was actually proposed (un-
officiatiy) by one E.C. member
that the E.C. take it upon them-
selves to select the editors and
business managers of the stu-
dent publications. Seriously.
Aside from the fact that they
could never be qualified to
make such decisions, such a pro-
posal represents a further step
towards what would be called

totalitarianism anywhere else.
The danger of having an E.C.
appointee as head of the stu-

Hampden-Sydney defeats Wé?L;
Generals prepare for Sewanee

The football Generals kick off
the second half of their 1976 sea-
son with a home contest against
the University of the South from
Sewanee, Tennessee this Saturday.
Game time is 1:30 p.m. on W&L’s
Wilson Field.

Th South, more commonly re-
ferred to as the Sewanee Tigers,
is coming off a 22-18 College
Athletic Conference (C.A.C.) win
over Southwestern, a victor over
W&L by a 28-3 score a week ago.
The Generals will be trying to re-
bound from a hard fought 15-7
setback at the hands of eighth
ranked Hampden-Sydney. The an-
nual contest against Sewanee is
one which the W&L players and
coaches look to with great an-
ticipation. The series, which
reached its high point when both
teams were members of the

Keydet Kickers
keep it close

By HEARTSILL RAGON

Virginia Military Institute beat
Washington and Lee University in
soccer action Friday afternoon by
a score of 2-1.

Fred Allner fired in a goal with
1:11 left to play in the game to
give VMI the win.

‘This goal was the second of the
day for Allner who, according to
VMI’s head soccer coach Capt. Jim
Clark, now leads the team in
total number of goals scored.

Allner scored his fifst goal with
22:30 left to play in the first half.
He caught W&L’s goalie, Mark
Bennett, offguard and kicked in
a 20-yard shot to give the Keydet’s
a 1-0 lead at the half.

W&L’s ability to control the ball
increased in the second half. With
33:44 left in the game the Gen-
erals’ Mike Monohan was able to
break away from his defender and
receive a pass from Jeff Barr to
make an easy one-on-one goal.

W&L and VMI played evenly
for the next 30 minutes and the
crowd began to talk about the
possibility of overtime. This talk
was short-lived when VMI’s Allner
came up with a surprise unas-
sisted goal that caught the upper-
lefthand corner of the goal.

With only 1:11 left to play in
the game, the Generals were un-
able to put together any scoring
attack.

W&L’s season record falls to 2-
5 while VMI's record stands a 3-5.

Coach Clark of VMI said, “It
could have worked out either
way, I’m just very happy it went
our way.”

VMI's next game is Monday
against Furman College at VMI.
W&L plays Lynchburg in Lexing-
ton Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.

C.A.C., stands at 12 victories each.

Sewanee, currently 2-3 this sea-
son, won the 1975 meeting at
home, 13-3, while the General
were victorious by a 7-0 score in
1974 on Wilson Field.

Last Saturday in Hampden-
Sydney, Va, W&L put forth a
valiant effort before succumbing
to the conference leading Tigers
of H-S, 15-7. With only eight
on a 32 yard run from scrimmage
by freshman runningback Stewart
minutes gone, the Generals scored
Atkinson, The stingy General de-
fense made the lead stand until
ten minutes remained in the third
quarter when Gary Garner booted
a 24 yard field goal for H-S. Half-
back Jimmy Ferguson gave the
Tigers a 9-6 lead just before the
end of the third quarter with a
five yard touchdown run. H-S

quarterback Bill Newell capped
the scoring with a one yard
plunge with 1:41 remaining to
play.

Hampden-Sydney, the eighth
ranked division III team in the
nation upped its season record to
5-1 and to 2-1 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. The Generals
dipped to 1-4 overall and to 1-2 in
the conference. W&L’s lone re-
maining league game is on
October 30th at Bridgewater.

Atkinson, W&L’s leading ground
gainer, finished the game with 118
yards on 27 carries. That was the
first time a W&L back has rushed
for over 100 yards since fullback
Mercer West ran for 19 yards
against Sewanee on October 26,
1974 in a game at Wilson Field.
Atkinson’s 32 yard TD was the
first W&L touchdown scored by

rushing all season. Freshman
punter Sid Farrar had an excel-
lent day, averaging 39.5 yards on
six kicks, ineluding a 53 yarder.
The Generals came up with three
interceptions, one each by sopho-
mores Bryan Sibson and Jack
Norberg, and freshman John Mar-
tin, which set up the game’s first
touchdown.

For his play against H-S, George
Berry, a 6-3 sophomore tackle
from Charlotte, N.C. was named
W&L’s Offensive Player of the
Weekk. Bryan Sibson, the sopho-
more strong safety from Haver-
town, Pa. was voted the team’s
top defensive performer. Sibson
had eight solo tackles, three as-
sists and an interception in the
IIl-S game,

Siegenthaler discusses free press, lst Amendment

(Continued from page 1)

stands are never comfortable” and
that he realized the implications
of his opinion on the dismissa! of
cases. He said that in this “crime-
infested and media-saturated”
society where “change is the one
constant ... there may be people
who can’t get a fair trial.”

He said his stand on dismissal
“does create problems” but said
that it should be used only when
change of venue or postponement
of trial cannot solve the problems
of pre-trial publicity. He called
dismissal the “obvious solution”
to such problems and cited cases,
notably Daniel Ellsberg’s trial for
allegedly stealing the Pentagon
Papers, where judges dismissed
charges because of government
wiretaps.

No one suggested using the con-
tempt power against the govern-
ment officials in those cases, he
said, and he could see no reason
why the press should be “singled
out” by judges.

He suggested that when investi-
gators insist that reporters reveal
where they got a story, it is an
indication that the police and
prosecutors are not doing their
jobs.

“Reporters from time to time
abuse other rights,” he said, but
added that the number of report-
ers who have gone to jail rather
than reveal sources proves that
they will act responsibly in this
area.

Seigenthaler backed up his ab-
solute view of the First Amend
ment historically by mentioning

that the press was “semi-literate,
ungrammatical and ill-informed”
when the amendment was written.
The Founding Fathers gave the
press absolute freedom anyway,
he said.

He said the press has a re-
sponsibility to “examine and ex-
pose” without worrying about
harming the system of justice.
They have a duty to scrutinize
the police, judges, prosecutor and
defense and to “punish what, in
the reporter’s judgement, the pub-
lic needs to know.”

Seigenthaler’s speech was fol-
lowed by a question-and-answer
session that developed into a de-
bate between the- speaker and
Prof. Clark Mollenhoff.

Mollenhoff pointed out that in
the Shephard decision, a case in-
volving pre-trial publicity in a
Cleveland murder trial that
spawned the television series “The
Fugitive.” the Court found that

dent Activities Board was in the
process of selecting a freshman
to sit on the board, contrary to
an E.C. motion passed at the last
meeting. No decision was reached
and members of the Curriculum
Committee then noted that they
had no desire to have a freshman
sit on their committee.

Walt Kelley requested that the
Board of Trustees be asked about
the parking situation in front of
the Woods Creek Apartments. One
concerned student and apartment
dweller added that they might
also inquire about the purpose of
the large boulders in front of the
apartments. Tom Hunter said the
matter would be brought before
the Trustees.

Dave “Radar” Davis suggested
that signs be posted in the Stu-
dent Center stating that the facili-
ties are off limits to townspeople
due to abuse of the facilities by
some young townspeople. Davis
cited an incident where a student
studying in Fairfax Lounge had
his coat stolen, presumably by a
group of young children.

the judge, not the press, was at
fault.

Seigenthaler countered that the
case had nonetheless been the sti-
mulus for the Reardon and Kauf-
man studies into “coverage of
crime ... by the media” which
suggested the “cautious” use of
the contempt power,

Mollenhoff also suggested that
a reporter waving a placard de-
claring the defendant guilty
would, under Seigenthaler’s plan,
lead to a dismissal.

Seigenthaler qualified his earlier
remarks by saying that judges
should dismiss prejudiced cases
only when the journalist involved

is doing his job as a reporter.

Mollenhoff’s closing statement
that they were in agreement
brought scattered cheers and ap-
plause from the audience. Mollen-
hoff said after the speech that he
and Seigenthaler had been argu-
ing for twenty years.
