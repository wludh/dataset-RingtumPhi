Herman & Herd:
a sound of today

by JAY TAYLOR

His band plays tunes by John
Fogerty, Carole King, Frank Zap-
pa and Stanley Clarke. He cut an
album featuring blockbuster gui-
tarist Mike Bloomfield, who has
been associated with many major
rock artists including Dylan and
Stephen Stills. His band is young
and he is playing at Fancy Dress.

Who is this guy?

John Mayall? Erie Clapton? El-
vis? Al Black?

It's Woody Herman. And you
probably thought he still plays
“Laura,” with it’s dripping senti-
mentality and sauve saxaphones.
Not Woody. Not the Thundering
Herd.

If Herman sounds anything like
his records, and anything like
what the critics say about him, the
music is going to make disco
sound mighty thin. Herman and
the Thundering Herd have jn-
coroprated rock rhythms with the
musical idiom he grew up with,
the same music that most of rock
and roll emulates, the black blues.

Now this is beginning to sound
like a press release for the SAB.
But I was highly skeptical at the
first announcement of the Herman

show. “Another one of those,” I
thought. “Everybody trying to

act like Mom and Dad with this
dated crap.”

But after listening to a few
Herman cuts, I realized what the
man is trying to do. He has as-
sembled fine young musicians and
has given them “coaching” as he
puts it. In turn, they have con-
tributed rock culture and its live-
liness. Herman is too creative to
stagnate in any one sound.

This is the forty-first year that
Herman has been involved with
big bands. He started in 1936 with
the disbanded members of the Is-
ham Jones orchestra. While the

jazz scene was overfloiwng with
Benny Goodman-ish swing, Her-
man’s band played the blues, and
called itself ‘The Band That Plays
the Blues.” The band dissolved
during the war, and the Herman
Herds lineage began.

The First Herd had it’s biggest
hit with “Caledonia.” Igor Stra-
vinsky wrote “Ebony Concerto”
for the Herd. “The First Herd was
perhaps the most vital white jazz
band ever,” according to the Jazz
Book by Joachin Berendt.

Dave Tough drummed in that
First Herd, and is considered to
be on par with Gene Krupa. “He
helped pave the way for modern
drumming” according to the Jazz
Book.

When many people are trumpet-
ing the return of the big band
sound, Woody Herman has always
been here. He disdains the nostal-
gia craze though, in the music of
the forties. “I can hardly bear the
whole scene. It’s a great sadness

‘to see some of these people

who've been in retirement for
years, and they pump them up for
a minute and bring them back to
life for a minute.”

A press release describes Her-
man’s exerience with the blues.
“Ironically, young people today
seem to think they discovered the
Black man’s blues when actually
over thirty years ago Woody and
Jack Teagarden were the only two
whites accepted as true blues
singers along with such black ar-
tists as Big Bill Bronzy, Jimmy
Fushing, T-Bone Walker-and Lead-
belly.”

A SPE from Marquette Univer-

sity, Woody has said “I’ve always .

had a ‘sound’ but never a style.
My approach to the music I am
involved in always has been let it
be tasteful, let it be exciting, and
always let it swing.”

SAB: Six turndowns for Springs

The Student Activities Board is
“having difficulty getting any-

Jimmy Buffet have all declined in-

Armstrong also said he was not

Armstrong promised the finan-

in.

The net loss of about $6,000 was

THE RING-TUM PH1

 

Good-bye old friend

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The University has taken a step. Whether forward or back-
ward, we're not quite sure,

Acting in the name of efficiency, economy, and progress,
the University has decided to reduce sharply the amount of
space and equipment alloted to the Journalism Laboratory
Press, otherwise known as the Print Shop. The immediate and
short-term effect of this action will be a significant reduction
in the capacity of the Print Shop for service to the University.
The long-term effects are difficult to predict.

“The University” in this case is represented by President
R.E.R. Huntley, his assistant Frank Parsons, Treasurer James
Whitehead, Publications Director Romulus Weatherman,
Dean of the College William Watt, News Information Direc-
tor Bob Keefe, and Journalism Department Head Ron Mac-
Donald, with an assist from Scheid Associates, a Pittsburgh-
based consulting firm which specializes in academic print
operations management.

Based partially on the Scheid study and partially on their
own observations and ideas, this University committee’s de-
cisions include: consolidation of Copy Center and Print Shop
operations into a “Printing Center” occupying two-thirds or
less of the space now occupied by the Print Shop alone ; elimi-
nation of the Shop's most advanced press; elimination of all
hot-type equipment (currently used for almost everything, in-
cluding the Ring-tum Phi, Shenandoah, \lumni Magazine,
and many others); “vendoring” of major printing jobs (in-
cluding the Ring-tum Phi, Shenandoah, Alumni Magazine,
and many others) to commercial printers outside the com-

have only a minor impact on the University community, while
admitting that people will be forced to adjust themselves to
some new ways of doing things. This may prove to be quite an
understatement. Without going into technical detail: the out-
moded hot-type equipment is being slowly replaced with
modern offset equipment. Unfortunately, there is not yet
enough offset equipment to handle all the work now done with
hot-type; a gap in the Shop's services is the inevitable result,
at least until the new set-up is more complete.

The victims of this reduction in services will be numerous ;
administrators; faculty, and students will all have to reckon
with the changes effected by the University decision, The
volume of work done by the Print Shop and Copy Center is
enormous ; few people realize the extent to which this Univer-
sity is dependent upon the countless reams of high-quality
printed material produced by these services. We never know
how much we have until we lose it.

The effects of this move will be felt most directly by the
Print Shop and Copy Center staffs, who were not consulted
about these decisions until after they were made. The printers
at the Shop are professional craftsmen who take great pride
in the quality of their award-winning work, While the Uni-
versity has promised that no jobs will be eliminated, they won-
der about the future of a Shop with but little work requiring
professional attention.

Not many universities operate full high-quality print shops
on campus. But then, not many are as special as Washington
and Lee. We can only note in sorrow the passing of one of

 

munity.

W&L’'s unique traditions.

The University takes the position that these changes will

WGL

Scenario: It's Friday night of Faney Dress
weekend in Doremus Gymnasium. The event
is the ODAC tournament which determines
what teams will go on to compete in the
NCAA regional playoffs. The host of the
tournament, conference leading Washington
and Lee, is on the floor against Bridgewater
in the opening game. The stands on the op-
ponents’ side are packed, There are 43 people
on W&L’'s side.

The picture painted above could become a
reality unless our students do something
about it. How many of you have plans to at-
tend the game Friday night? Too busy, huh?
That's right, | forgot. Got to start drinking
at 5.05 p.m. right after classes, No time to
take a breather and cheer on our team on
their way to the conference championship.
Haney Dress is tonight. The game can he
played without me there, right?

Sure it can. The other 16 home games have
heen. | guess around 9-pam, most of W&L
will be asking, “I wonder who won the game
ionight?” More than likely, the response will
he “Oh, | forgot there was a game.”

What is wrong with us, people? Our basket-
hall team is ranked 4th in the nation, and no
hody gives a damn, That means, of all the
hundreds of schools in. Division II only three
are better than we are! Attendance at home
vames wouldn't show it though, You'd think
we were in the bottom 10 instead of the top 10

it's not a fluke either, This team is the best
ever in. W&L history. It holds the longest
winning streak in the school’s history, \s of
Saturday, the 1976-77 team has won more
vames in one season than any other team,
hey have the best record in Division IIL and
are close to leading the Division in scoring
margin, free throw percentage, and scoring
average.

Phe Generals’ brand of basketball is exert
ing. Good ball control, excellent field goal
percentage, good defense and offense. The
team has its ball wizard (Mike Wenke), and
fiery shooter (Pat Dennis). Any other stu
dent hody would be busting their buttons w ith
pride at having a team like this. Too bad they
play at W&L. ;

Yes. here at W&L, we don’t have time tor
‘thleties too many conflicts, We can't go to
the games during the week because we are
too busy studying so we can party on the
weekend. We can't go to the games on the
weekend because we are too busy partying
\nother important excuse for not going te
WA&L always loses, “If ever W&I
tarted winning,” tell “the
crowds would pick up.” Who are we trymg

rillics
we ourselves,
to lool?

Look at swimming. Year after year, W&!
has All-American swimmers who go to com
pete in the Nationals Time after time we
heat first class Division I teams, It seems as
though we have a first class swimming pro
blow heen to a

withing meet?

you have

eran many of

Spirit?

How about football? After a lousy half sea-
son, the team started beating people they
shouldn't have. It loked as though we might
have our first non-losing season in a decade,
“Ho-hum,” was the reaction. The only game
that drew was the Homecoming game, and
that was because it was something to do be-
fore the grain party.

Where else, but at W&L, could the home
team be first-and-goal in their opponent's ter-
ritory and the fans act as though they were
about to punt?

Where else, but at W&L, could the Tlome-
coming dance be held on a Friday night so
the foothall players couldn't atend? Home-
coming is a celebration for the special oca-
sion when a group of people return to the
place they regard as home, So, | ask you, isn't
i. a bit odd to have a party when the guest of
honor can't be there? SAB co-chairman, John
ierley, remarked,” No one cares about foot-
hall. We'd still have a ‘homecoming’ even if
we didn't have a football team. It would just
he called something else.” We seem to have
misplaced our motives somewhere over the
years, don't you think?

Mayhe legitimate excuses exist for poor at-
iendance in the mentioned sports.
Swimming and similar sports are not what
vou would call “big” sports. The football team
hasn't been what it used to be, that’s for sure,
Hut, what is the excuse for basketball? None
exists. The b-ball Generals had 11
straight winning teams and still can’t draw
the crowds. Don't tell me the students here
aren't basketball fans. They must like basket-
hall enough to pay to see VMI play some of
the same teams W&L does.

The problem is, W&L doesn't mean the
same thing to us that it meant to the men be-
fore us. It seems as though we are enduring
this college experience, rather than enjoying
it. This is evidenced by the calibre of partying
carried on here, There is no unity here at
Wa&l. There are to many opposing factions ;
independent vs. frats; frats vs. frats; rock vs,
woul: athleties vs. scholasties. The sad thing
is, no one cares about anyone else, Everyone
for himself. In the system that now exists,
there are too many takers, and not enough
vivers. Whatever hapened to the close-knit

above

have

small college atmosphere?

\fter you graduate, what would you rather
remember about your colege experience how
many times you got drank, or the excitement
of coming together as a student body and
cheering your 4th-ranked basketball team on
to the national championship? You can get
drunk anytime, but how many chances will
vou get to be caught up in the crowd enthus

iasm and maybe see W&L go all the way? The

Generals have never done it before, and they
may never get the chance to do it again, This
is the first time in their 71-year history they
have been nationally ranked, and 4th at that!
It's too bad they haven't had our support

along the way,--up to now

Darrell plans changes
for Cockpit-game room

by BILL THOMSON

Gerald Darrell, manager of
Evans Dining Hall, was named
head manager of the Cockpit fol-
lowing the Feb. 11 death of Mar-
shall Sumner, who managed the
Cockpit for the last year and a
half. Darrell’s additional duties
are part of a Washington Hall-di-
rected move to consolidate the
food services in the Early-Field-
ing University Center. :

“I’m working closely with the
University Center Committee in
order to find out what the stu-
dents want to do with the Cock-
pit,” Darrell said. The University
Center Committee, with the help
of student suggestions, will con-
centrate on improving the effici-
ency and flexibility of the Cock-
pit and game room facilities. The
committee will hold an open meet-
ing in the Cockpit on Feb. 28 at
4:30 p.m. Darrell and Mike Cap-
peto, W&L placement director,
are the committee’s administra-
tion members; the student mem-
bers are Doug Jackson, Charles
Hulfish, Bob Chiaviello and Bill
Thomson.

“We have to find out things,”
said Darrell. “The Cockpit has
been more like a ‘nice Co-op’ than
a student rathskeller.” He said
that the Cockpit should have eith-
er a ‘club atmosphere’ or a ‘snack
bar atmosphere’—depending on
what the students prefer.

Ambassador opens exhibit

A bequest of reproductions of
selected works from the National
Museum of History of the Repub:
lie of China, Taipei, Taiwan, and
of paintings from the Art Society
of China, to W&L’s permanent art
collection will be on exhibit for
the first time in duPont Gallery
from March 1 through 25.

On display will be reproduc-
tions of Chinese bronzes, porce-
lains, ceramics, and prints of tra-
ditional brush paintings by an-
cient masters. Contemporary oil
paintings, watercolors, graphics,
and brush paintings, donated to
W&L by members of the Art Soc-
iety of China will also be exhibit-
ed at this time. The Gallery is
open Monday through Friday from
8 am to 5 p.m.; there is no ad-
mission charge.

His Excellency Dr. James C. H.
Shen, Ambassador of the Republic
of China, and Mrs. Shen will be
here March 1 at 8 p.m. to open
the exhibit to the general public,
and to officially present the set of
reproductions from the National
Museum to W&L. After the pre-
sentation, Dr. Shen will give a
brief talk in duPont auditorium.
A reception will immediately fol-
low.

The bequest of the reproduc-
tions is the result of a campaign
initiated last Spring to secure
them for W&L’s permanent col-
lection by I-Hsiung Ju, Artist-in-
Residence, and coordinator of the
East Asian Study Abroad Pro-
gram; Art in Taiwan. While in Tai-
wan last Spring, Professor Ju and
his W&L students participated in
several activities sponsored by the
National Museum, a center for the
learning of Chinese culture and
art. A close relationship develop-

this colection could prove univer-
sally beneficial to W&L: “As a
teacher of Oriental art and art his-
tory, of course, I need them for
my classes. And I believe that
other professors in language, his-
tory, religion, and philosophy of
our East Asian Program will also
find this collection very useful.”

Professor Ju and Mr. Ho appeal-
ed for financial aid to the Minister
of Education of Taipei, who grant-

-ed 170,000 New Taiwanese Dollars
(4,250 U.S. dollars) for materials,
plus labor, shipping expenses, and
insurance, so that the Museum
staff could produce a set of repli-
cas as a gift to W&L.

Taking the National Museum's
action as an example, members of
the Art Society of China voluntar-
ily contributed many of their own
works to form another part of
W&L’s permanent collection.

Professor Ju commented for
members of the Art Society, for
members of the Museum staff, and
for himself as well that “This oc-
casion is the prelude of a greater
understanding of Chinese culture;
in the future, there wil be more
valuable cultural activities to
come to our area, promoting East
Asian Studies, which are the step-
ping stones toward closer friend-
ship between the Chinese and
American peoples.”

The University Center Commit-
tee wil consider measures to deal
with several problems associated
with the Cockpit and the adjoin-

_ing game room: difficulty filling
large numbers of diverse orders
and the coresponding slow serv-
ice during busy periods; controll-
ing people who carry their own
alcholic beverages into the stu-
dent center; making sure that cus-
tomers pay for their meals; keep-
ing local teenagers out of the stu-
dent center; and allowing student
talent to perform in the Cockpit
more frequently.

Possible measures under con-
sideration by the committee are:

1. Thinning down the menu
“to five or six popular sand-
wiches” by eliminating items that
are slow sellers (baked potato,
etc.) so that orders will be less
complicated and service will be
more efficient. Customer tickets
will be collected for a week or two
in order to determine the most
popular items on the Cockpit
menu.

2. Hiring students in the work-
study program to “patrol” the stu-
dent center and game rom in or-
der to cut down on the amount of
illegal alcohol carried into the
building and the number of trou-
blesome teenagers in the building
(recent incidents: pool table flipp-
ed upside down, skateboarding in
the halls, Cockpit employee hit
with pool cue). Darrell said the al-
cohol problem was “serious” and
that the law has been “flagrantly
violated.” When the game room
first opened, students were hired
to keep trouble from starting
around the pinball machines.

3. Giving students who would
like to perform in the Cockpit the
opportunity to arrange perfor-
mance times and receive SAB
sound equipment. Darrell is “de-
finitely in favor of student enter-
tainment—there’s a lot of talent
that hasn’t been touched.”

4. Requiring payment when a
meal order is taken so that cus-
tomers do not walk away without
paying for their food .This pro-
cedure has already been adopted
at night (Cockpit employees often
find crumpled order tickets when
they are cleaning tables.

It is the nicest facility in Lex-
ington,” Darrell said. “We want to
make better use of the facilities.”

For those who are concerned
about possible changs in Ye Olde
Cockpit, Darrell has encouraging
words. “We are not going to turn
the Cockpit into a McDonald's,”
he said. “We want to do a profes-
sional job, an dto do this we have
to use the available systems to
best suit. the needs of the stu-
dents.”

Applications for editor and busi-
ness manager of all student publi-
cations are due soon. Contact Bill
Thomson for details. Open to all
students.

The Triumphs

After wins over Bridgewater
and UNC-Greensboro, the W&L
basketball Generals have some-
thing every collegiate athlete
dreams of—being able to say his
team is the best in school history.
The Generals outscored UNC-G
Wednesday night 101-94 and ham-
mered Bridgewater 103-96 Satur-
day.

W&L has now played 15 conse-
cutive games without a loss—a
school record, They are only the
third team in the 71-year history
of W&L basketball to win 20
games in a season and they are
the only club to earn 21 victories.
In addition to that impressive 21-
2 record, the Generals are the
number four team in the nation
in Division III while commanding
the best winning percentage in
the nation (.913).

The list of personal and team
superlatives could continue al-
most indefinitely but the point has
been made—this is the best bas-
ketball team in W&L’s history.
And they played the part well in
defeating UNC-G and Bridgewat-
er.

W&L had played the Greensboro
Spartans earlier this season in
Lexington, having no problems in
winning. The Generals had no
problems in the rematch, either,
even though it was played at
UNC-G. W&L utilized their of-
fense to near perfection in rack-
ing up 101 points but in the end
it was their checking defense that
held off a Spartans rally.

Pat Dennis led the W&L scoring
with a whopping 32 points, anoth-
er big night for the hot-shooting
junior from Baltimore, Maryland.
He received ample support from
senior Chris Larson who came off
the bench to pop in 25 markers.
As usual, seniors Bob Flint and
Don Berlin controlled the boards
while sophomore guard Mike
Wenke continued to dish out as-
sists at his record breaking pace.

The win over UNC-G marked
several milestones. It was W&L's
14th straight victory which tied a
school record. It also gave W&L a
20-victory season (only the third
team in the school’s history to
earn that honor) and Coach Verne
Canfield his 200th career coach-
ing victory.

Saturday night carked the cul-
mination of a successful season in

the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence as the Generals blasted con-
ference foe Bridgewater. The
homestanding Eagles were never
in it, falling behind by 11 points in
the first half and never catching
up.

Once again, the big gun for the
Generals was Pat Dennis who gar-
nered a season-high 33 points.
Dennis connected on 15 of 23
shots for a blistering field goal
percentage of 65 per cent. In fact,
the entire team shot well, con-
verting 48 per cent of their field
goal attempts.

While Dennis was providing the
bulk of the scoring, Bob Flint,
Don Berlin and Dave Leunig were
turning in a strong game on the
boards as well as scoring. Berlin
pumped in 17 points and pulled
off 10 rebounds. Both Flint and
Leunig grabbed 13 errent shots
while they scored 16 and 13 points
respectively.

The two victories increased the
Generals winning percentage, al-
ready the best in the nation. And

they stand a good chance of mov-
ing up a couple more notches in
the national poll. The last regular
season contest will be March 2
against Madison College. The
ODAC tournament will be held at
W&L this week to determine who
receives a regional berth.

The Challenge

Much has been said about the
Generals brilliant 21-2 record, na-
tional ranking and ODAC regular
season championship. But you
can throw all those records out
the window when the First An-
nual Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Tournament is played this
week.

Washington and Lee won the
ODAC regular season title handi-
ly, compiling a near perfect 9-1
record. Ironically, the only loss
was at home to third place Ham-
pden-Sydney. Close behind the
Generals was Lynchburg College
at 82. H-S was third with a 7-3
mark while Bridgewater placed a
distant fourth with an unimpres-

sive record of 3-7.

Even though the Generals would
appear to be the superior team
in the conference, everybody
knows that tournament time has a
long history of upsets. However,
a couple of underlying factors
might give W&L an edge that
could lead them to the tourna-
ment championship.

Probably the most important in-
fluence is the location of the tour-
nament games—Doremus Gym-
nasium. In effect, the Generals
will hold a strong home court ad-
vantage, especially if the W&L
students show up in mass.

A second influence is the tour-
nament schedule. By virtue of its
regular season record, W&L has
been top-seeded which means they
will play Bridgewater at 7 p.m.
Friday. Bridgewater is the weak-
est of the tournament teams while
the 7 p.m. starting time avoids a
conflict with the Fancy Dress Ball
that night. Lynchburg _ plays
Hampden-Sydney Friday at 9 p.m.
with the two winners advancing

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

The Triumphs and the Challenge

to the championship game Satur-
day night.

The third influencing factor is
the Division III national regional
bid. If W&L lost in the tourna-
ment it might still receive an at-
large bid for the regionals but it
can not be counted on. However,
if W&L should win the tourna-
ment title it would automatically
become one of the four teams in
the regionals. Furthermore, two
tournament victories would give
W&L an added advantage—a very
strong possibility of hosting the
regionals within the friendly con-
fines of Doremus Gymnasium. In
summary, the combination of a
big crowd and two tournament
victories might give W&L a home
court advantage through the re-
gionals.

The fourth and final factor is
the superiority of W&L on paper
when compared to the other tour-
nament contestants. The Generals
have beaten Bridgewater twice
this year; both by large margins.
The Eagles are very young and in-

Winning ts the only thing he knows

by J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

What does the coach of the na-
tion’s 4th ranked Division II] team
have to say after W&L obtained
their 20th victory this season and
his 200th career victory? Not
much! At least not much about
himself.

Vern Canfield, for the 11 of 13
winning seasons he has been here,
has had very little to say about
himself. But ask him about his
team and he’ll talk your ear off.

“’'m extremely proud of this
team. They have played well this
year and their success is due to
their own efforts. All I do is teach
them to believe in themselves, and
believe in their fellow teammates.
My program emphasizes team-
work, and unless a young man is
willing to give 110% of himself
towards accomplishing that goal,
he can’t play for me.”

Canfield’s coaching colleagues
have given him much of the cred-
it for W&L’s successes, but he has
no personal accolades about him-
self. In fact, he rarely uses the
pronouns I, my, mine, or me, but
rather we, our, ours, and us. He
will take credit for one thing
though.

“We have a program here at
W&L that promotes winning,
which I only coordinate. The team
takes the credit for all our wins.
I am responsible for our losses.”

Maybe that is why the Generals
rarely lose. Canfield is the win-
ningest coach in W&L history and
also in this year’s Diviison II.
For his career, a 201-117 record
for a .632 percentage, and this
year a 21-2 record for a .913 per-
centage. No other basketball
coach at W&L has won over 100
games, and Canfield is also re-
sponsible for 2 out of the 3 sea-
sons a W&L team has finished
with 20 or more wins (the last was
1966-67). His teams have had 11
straight winning seasons.

About this year’s team: “I’ve
never had a team that I believed
in more, and not because they are
great basketball players, because
they're not. The kids on this team
are the kind of people who will be
successful in life. Each and every
one of them has good character,
personality, and intelligence. But
most important, the kids this year
are totally unselfish. They try to
make their teammates look good,
rather than themselves.

“It is true that I have pushed
them hard in parctice, more so
than past teams. That is because
they are good basketball players,
and 100% for them is 110% for
anyone else. However, the real
reason this team wins is because
it is made up of beautiful people
who care about one another.

Why doesn’t a man who obvious-
ly knows his basketball, and
knows it well, move on to “higher
ground”?

“The job here has many plusses.
I get total support from the Ath-

P.S.: Keep in mind, our Alteration & Pressing

letic Department and the school

Hence, I run them my way and get
what I want for my team. What
coach could complain about a
system like that? Next, are the
faculty benefits, and W&L has
plenty to offer. Most important to
me though, is that coaching at
W&L is a challenge. We don’t give
scholarships here, so we don’t
have any ‘blue chippers’ and con-
sequently I have to teach bas-
ketball rather than coach it.”

“All this means is that a special
type of man plays basketball at
W&L. I want a guy who comes out
to play because he enjoys it, not
because he is ‘bound for glory.’
My men play because they want
to. They could be doing other
things like partying, but they
chose to play basketball.”

Puting aside all the victories in
his career, all the school records
about to be broken, the high na-
tional recognition finally achiev-
ed, Vern Canfield stil lacks one
important element characteristic
of a winning sports program.

“Ever since I have been here,
the school has never had the kind
of support this type of program
needs. The support we have re-
ceived hasn’t been consistent. This
is true for all the sports here at
W&L.”

“If you are winning, everything
is ‘rah, rah’. If your team is having
a mediocre season, you can give
up all hopes for a good crowd
turnout for a home game.”

“A crowd can make a differ-
ence. Take this past Randolph-
Macon game. The fans helped us
win that ball game. The players
need the home fans support. Re-
member, they are supposed to be

playing for ‘the school’.”

“Students say they can’t make
the games because they have to
study. Well, the basketball players
have to study also, besides giving
up much of their social life dur-
ing the season. Why couldn’t some
of those students give up a por-
tion of their social life to watch
their team?”

“In the past, we have treid
cheerleaders, pep rallies, and free
beer as gimmicks to draw crowds
(not to mention always free ad-
mission). Now we have a team that
is on the verge of greatness, and
an average home game draws a
crowd of only 200 students. Yet,
when VMI plays Hampden-Sydney
in our gym and packs it, 200 W&L
students pay to see them beat H-S
by fewer points than when we
beat them here.”

“If I sound embittered, it’s just
because I’m fighting for my guys.
It is just not fair to the boys who
get out on that court and make a
name for this school to be ignored
by the school. The student body.
and the faculty, should be proud
of this group of guys. They should

give them some recognition every “

once in a while by slapping them
on the back and saying ‘Good job’.
But they don’t—and its a shame.”

experienced while depending on
two players, Reiley and Hayes, for
their scoring W&L shot well
against the Eagles in both meet-
ings while totally controlling the
boards. The same should take
place in the tournament unless
Bridgewater ‘utilizes a stall. But
the Generals pressure defense and
patient offense should be able to
handle the stall just as easily.
Winning the championship game
won't be so easy. W&L has beaten
Lynchburg twice this year but
both games were closely contest-
ed, The Hornets possess two out-
standing players in high-scoring
forward Jim Crawford and center
E. D. Schecterly. Both players
have performed well against W&L

‘but the Generals have won on

team depth. Hampden-Sydney is
another club that has given the
Generals trouble. The Tigers beat
W&L by two points and lost on a
shot at the buzzer by Chris Larson.
The Tigers are tall while forward
Ed Tieran is a profilic scorer. As
Tieran goes, so goes H-S.
REPORTER’S PREDICTIONS:
The Generals wil easily defeat
Bridgewater with Bob Flint lead-
ing the way. The Eagles will not
stall but look for them to blow the
tempo down. In the other semi-
final game, I pick Lynchburg as
Crawford and Schecterly are bet-
ter than just Tieran. However,
Lynchburg has beaten H-S twice
and everybody knows it is hard to
beat a team three times. Look for
a close game. In the championship
tilt I tap W&L to slip by the Hor-
nets on team depth and, hopefully,
a large W&L crowd with the usual
vocal support that comes with it.
Look for Flint, Dennis and Leunig
to star. With those two victories,
the Generals should receive a re-
gional bid and the host court.

Trackers finish 2nd

W&L’'s indoor track and field
team ended their abbreviated dual
meet season at 2-1, and finished in
2nd place in last Saturday’s Lyn-
chburg Relays. The team will par-
ticipate in this weekend’s ODAC
Championship Meet in Lynchburg,
along with the host Hornets,
Bridgewater, EMC, Emory and
Henry, and Roanoke.

Field leader Phil Dunley finish-
ed in first in the 35 lb. weight
event and the shot put last Satur-
day, while the Generals entries in
the 440 and 880 relays also took
top honors. W&L has the potential
to capture the title in this Satur-
day’s ODAC Championship Meet.

Hence, I run them my way and get
what I want for my team. What
coach could complain about a
system like that? Next, are the
faculty benefits, and W&L has
plenty to offer. Most important to
me though, is that coaching at
W&L is a challenge. We don’t give
scholarships here, so we don’t
have any ‘blue chippers’ and con-
sequently I have to teach bas-
ketball rather than coach it.”

“All this means is that a special
type of man plays basketball at
W&L. I want a guy who comes out
to play because he enjoys it, not
because he is ‘bound for glory.’
My men play because they want
to. They could be doing other
things like partying, but they
chose to play basketball.”

Puting aside all the victories in
his career, all the school records
about to be broken, the high na-
tional recognition finally achiev-
ed, Vern Canfield stil lacks one
important element characteristic
of a winning sports program.

“Ever since I have been here,
the school has never had the kind
of support this type of program
needs. The support we have re-
ceived hasn’t been consistent. This
is true for all the sports here at
W&L.”

“If you are winning, everything
is ‘rah, rah’. If your team is having
a mediocre season, you can give
up all hopes for a good crowd
turnout for a home game.”

“A crowd can make a differ-
ence. Take this past Randolph-
Macon game. The fans helped us
win that ball game. The players
need the home fans support. Re-

playing for ‘the school’.”

“Students say they can’t make
the games because they have to
study. Well, the basketball players
have to study also, besides giving
up much of their social life dur-
ing the season. Why couldn’t some
of those students give up a por-
tion of their social life to watch
their team?”

“In the past, we have treid
cheerleaders, pep rallies, and free
beer as gimmicks to draw crowds
(not to mention always free ad-
mission). Now we have a team that
is on the verge of greatness, and
an average home game draws a
crowd of only 200 students. Yet,
when VMI plays Hampden-Sydney
in our gym and packs it, 200 W&L
students pay to see them beat H-S
by fewer points than when we
beat them here.”

“If I sound embittered, it’s just
because I’m fighting for my guys.
It is just not fair to the boys who
get out on that court and make a
name for this school to be ignored
by the school. The student body.
and the faculty, should be proud
of this group of guys. They should

give them some recognition every “

once in a while by slapping them
on the back and saying ‘Good job’.
But they don’t—and its a shame.”

experienced while depending on
two players, Reiley and Hayes, for
their scoring W&L shot well
against the Eagles in both meet-
ings while totally controlling the
boards. The same should take
place in the tournament unless
Bridgewater ‘utilizes a stall. But
the Generals pressure defense and
patient offense should be able to
handle the stall just as easily.
Winning the championship game
won't be so easy. W&L has beaten
Lynchburg twice this year but
both games were closely contest-
ed, The Hornets possess two out-
standing players in high-scoring
forward Jim Crawford and center
E. D. Schecterly. Both players
have performed well against W&L

‘but the Generals have won on

team depth. Hampden-Sydney is
another club that has given the
Generals trouble. The Tigers beat
W&L by two points and lost on a
shot at the buzzer by Chris Larson.
The Tigers are tall while forward
Ed Tieran is a profilic scorer. As
Tieran goes, so goes H-S.
REPORTER’S PREDICTIONS:
The Generals wil easily defeat
Bridgewater with Bob Flint lead-
ing the way. The Eagles will not
stall but look for them to blow the
tempo down. In the other semi-
final game, I pick Lynchburg as
Crawford and Schecterly are bet-
ter than just Tieran. However,
Lynchburg has beaten H-S twice
and everybody knows it is hard to
beat a team three times. Look for
a close game. In the championship
tilt I tap W&L to slip by the Hor-
nets on team depth and, hopefully,
a large W&L crowd with the usual
vocal support that comes with it.
Look for Flint, Dennis and Leunig
to star. With those two victories,
the Generals should receive a re-
gional bid and the host court.

Trackers finish 2nd

W&L’'s indoor track and field
team ended their abbreviated dual
meet season at 2-1, and finished in
2nd place in last Saturday’s Lyn-
chburg Relays. The team will par-
ticipate in this weekend’s ODAC
Championship Meet in Lynchburg,
along with the host Hornets,
Bridgewater, EMC, Emory and
Henry, and Roanoke.

Field leader Phil Dunley finish-
ed in first in the 35 lb. weight
event and the shot put last Satur-
day, while the Generals entries in
the 440 and 880 relays also took
top honors. W&L has the potential
to capture the title in this Satur-
day’s ODAC Championship Meet.
