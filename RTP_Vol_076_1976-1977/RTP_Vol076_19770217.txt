the Year!

 

Two years ago the E.C. decided
to revise the White Book, the
Bible of the Honor Code, the
rules for trials both private and
public. The picture above was
taken during those revision hear-
ings. Soon this year’s E.C. will get
the chance to show the same un-
bridled enthusiasm and interest
that Leland McCullough, Uniden-
tified Arm, Woody Ray and Scott
Franklin show above.—Ed.

Amendments to the White
s00k will be proposed by Rick
Goddard and possibly others
when the Executive Committee
meets Monday at 7 p.m. in the EC
room.

resentative, will propose amend-
ments to three sections of the
White Book. One of Goddard’s
proposals is changing the wording
to give an accused student at least
24 hours warning in writing be-
fore an honor trial can be held.

Students must be given three
hours notice the way the White
Book stands now.

Goddard wanted the EC to take
up his amendment proposals at
Monday night’s EC meeting, but
it was pointed out that the stu-
dent body constitution requires
the EC to put up a notice in Payne
Hall and the law school before
discussing proposals to amend the
White Book.

Paul Larkin said he also has a

number of White Book changes he
would like to make, such as clear-
ing up whether or not advisors
can be present at their advisee’s
honor trial.

But he said that changes in the
White Book “can’t be made piece-
meal.” He suggested @ special
meeting somtime in the future to
discuss nothing but a restructur-
ing of the White Book.

Walt Kelly said he has things he
would like to change in the White
Book. However, he did not see
why the EC should call a special
meeting to discuss the changes.

A motion that the EC post a
notice that “substantive and pro
cedural” changes in the White
Book will be discussed at the next
regular meeting of the EC passed
unanimously. That meeting will be
on Feb, 21.

Law women
present demands

by BOB CHIAVIELLO

An “Affirmative Action Pro-
posal” relating to treatment of
women students at the W&L Law
School was submitted Monday to
the faculty and administration.

The propasal by the Women
Law Students’ Organization (WL
SO) calls for the admission of all
women applicants with a 3.0 GPA
and 600 LSAT score, the release of
all admissions information on
WLSO applicants, the hiring of an
assistant dean for the recruit-
ment of women, and the hiring of
more women faculty members. So
far the administration has taken
no action.

Patricia Thursland, president of
the WLSO, said that the recent
mixer sponsored by the Student
sar Association was “the straw
that broke the camel’s back.”

Kate Schlech, who resigned
from the SBA social committee in
protest, said that she had been
fighting the use of SBA funds for
mixers back in the fal!. She said
ine “social committee gave us a
lot of back jazz so we took it to
the SBA, who wouldn’t take a
stand.”

The WLSO objects to the use of
SBA funds for activities that cat-
er to only a limited number of stu
dents. They said that 50% of the
law students are either married or

Changes

News of the plans of the [:xecutive Committee to initiate
discussion of possible White Book revisions comes as a pleas-

ant surprise. This heartwarming display of responsibility and
accountablity flies in the face of the widely-held attitude on
campus (at least | take it to be such) which maintains that
any revision in the Honor Code constitutes a compromising of

honor at Washington and Lee.

This could hardly be the E.C.’s intention. More probably,
their primary aim is to make the “trappings” of honor as sim-
ple, as sensible, and as fair as possible. This appears to be the
thrust of the proposal that an accused student be given written
notice 24 hours in advance of his trial. A reasonable sugges-
tion. Other proposals offered by E.C. members also seem to
have as their goal the improvement of a somewhat flawed

document.

The most critical revision now under study, and the one
most likely to stir controversy, has to do with the absolute
penalty. Many students consider this to be the heart of the
code, and any attempt to reduce the penalty for certain types of
violations will meet with stiff opposition, I for one cannot re-
ject the idea out of hand, It may be shown to make sense, This

is the duty of the ELC.

\ one-year suspension with the option of re-enrolling has
been suggested as an alternative. | see little merit in this par-
ticular proposal. If it is true that virtually no one would come
hack after a year (imagine the suspended student, head shaved,
dressed in a hair robe, absorbed in pentitent meditation for the
duration of his exile), then why make the change? And of
course it will be argued that a convicted student has no right

to come back at all.

One other problem remains in the aftermath of the “Ray

nard Seott case”.

that of information leakage in private honor

trials. The E..C. may consider some form of penalty for persons
found guilty of releasing such confidential material, Shades
of Daniel Ellsburg. The issue is further compounded by the
possibility that such a leak could originate with a member of
the E.C. itself; the accused, his friends, and witnesses at the

trial are also suspect in such cases. This problem must be ex-
amined with particular care. What happens to the student who
reveals “classified” information as an act of conscience?

REVIEW and OUTLOOK The Rin

For the next several weeks, it
will be the purpose of this article
to inform and entertain the W&L
public with the detailed results of
a recent personal and confidential
poll (taken of a representative
sample of students at area wo-
man’s schools.

Unlike earlier polls of this na-
ture, these results were obtained
and handled as by other profes-
sional surveys, giving a greater de-
gree of legitimacy to the final
tabulations. These results will be
separated categorically and pre-
sented for average and extreme
results, including some sample re-
sponses. So, stay tuned weekly to
the Ring-tum Phi poll for some in-
teresting and often helpful infor-
mation with some humorous side-

lights.

For this first installment of the

to call the “weekend wives.”
These are the lovelies from Mary

Notice

Memo from the Dean of Stu-
dents:

A number of students order mer-
chandise which is shipped via the
United Parcel Service.

Parcels have been delivered at
various times to the University
Cente rand to the University Sup-
ply Store. UPS is apparently un-
willing (or unable) to make de-
liveries to individual dormitory
rooms, principally because the de-
livery man is required to get a re-
ceipt and his ability to do so is de-
pendent on students’ schedules.

As a service to those who may
have already submitted orders
which UPS is to deliver, em-
ployees of the University Supply
Store have agreed to accept and
to sign for packages delivered be-
tween now and the first of March.
Thereafter, such deliveries will be
refused.

In the future, please request
that your orders be sent to your
post office box, or if you have
none, to general delivery.

“Three-Penny Opera”:
what is ths thing?

The Threepenny Opera, when it
opened in Berlin in 1928, was im-
mediately hailed as one of the
great plays of the new century. A
reworking by Bertolt Brecht of
John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera, it ran
for five years in Berlin—and then
for over six years in New York
(1954-61), setting an unprecedent-
ed record for an off-Broadway pro-
duction.

Basically, it is the story of the
events which led to the downfall
of Maecbeath, the infamous theif of
1837 London. This character, bet-
ter known in translation as Mack
the Knife, was originally portray-
ed in the Berlin production by
Harald Paulsen of operatic fame.
Vain as any stereotyped opera
star, he held out for a “big stage
entrance”: a song, to establish his
character of Macbeath. Out of all
this came the famous “Ballad of
Mack the Knife”, one of this cen-
tury’s true musical standards.
Created in collaboration with Kurt
Weill, the song is a moritat, or
chant which is sung at public
places, detailing the exploits of
famous murderers; a classic prolo-
gue to a great show,

Senior drama major John Ellis
has concocted a rather unusual
thesis project concerning this
show. He is simply coordinating
the efforts of a company of poor
« tors, who are going to present
Threepenny because they under
stand its appeal to “poverty's
plight.” And, as one of them said,
“It gives us a warm place to stay,
and money for ciragettes and liq
vor.” Ellis has been accused, per
haps justly, of laziness in bringing
a readymade troupe of actors to
W&L, but the inspiration he felt
upon seeing their performance
was to intense to pass up.

Traveling to Peru, Indiana, to
see the company's production, El-
lis, though pleased with their per
formance, was shocked to see the
company’s only horse die on stage
during the finale, Despite this tra

gic ending, our man in Peru re-
mained convinced, and signed the
contract.

Mr. F'lis comments: “It’s really
marvelous. They push this huge
wagon onstage and transform it
into a set.’ When asked for the
names of the prin ipal actors
Ellis claimed that they were to be
withheld as privileged informa-
tion—but guaranteed that the
horse will appear.

Production dates for the show
are Monday. Feb. 28-—Saturday,
March 5 at 8 p.m. in the Trouba-
dour Theatre. “That is, if the
thetare manages to raise enough
eash each night,” said Ellis. “I
have been warned that this bunch
won't go on stage unless paid be-
fore each curtain.” Nevertheless,
a nearly hysterical drama depart:
ment is offering tickets at a new
low price: FREE (this includes
eoat check and bathroom privi
leges), a8 long as you are a mem-
ber of our little college commun
ity and call 463-9111, ext. 371,
starting Monday.

One final word about these
overations: stepping outside of my
objectivity for one moment, I
must say that I have fundamental
doubts about Mr. Ellis’ show. The
question is: Is he flogging a dead
horse? And what about the com
pany? Will they find cash and
happiness (even if Vepeo refuses
to supply warmth)? Will Prof.
Kahn turn the Troub back into a
livery stable or barn after this hits
the boards? And what about Tri
pod” For the answer to these and
other questions, I can only tell you
to go and see Brecht and Weill’s
Threepenny Opera, coming up
soon—-you may even recognize a
few “familiar faces” in the crowd

onstage...

Letiers-to-the Editor are always.
welcome, They should be in geod |
tuste, refer lo campus issues, avoid
excessive length and present a co
heremt point of view.

firmatively to the question: “Are
you presently dating any one in-
dividual?” Therefore, it would
seem that only a narrow 37% of
the MBC student body remain for
those exciting blind dates.

Following up on these subjects
that were dating one individual, a
few questions about this lucky guy
were asked. In response to the
question: “where does he attend
school or work,” a variety of an-
swers were found with no specific
tendencies. As expected, the W&L
gentlemen were well represented
being the most often mentioned,
followed by VMI, Hampden-Syd-
ney, and a scattered assortment of
other colleges and jobs, from
Madison College students to jani-
tors at U. Va.

When asked, “how long have
you dated,” the range came down
to from one month to 5% years
with ro special tendencies. The
average length of steady dating
came down to about eleven
months. ;

As for the question of who is

dominant in the relationship a
full 42% felt that the male was,
36% felt that there was and equal
relationship, and the remainder
felt that they were the dominant
ones. How do you feel?

Finally, I got into the area that
I know you all are wondering
about—SEX! When asked, “have
you had sex together,” referring
specifically to their steady, over
47% answered “yes.” (about 3%
were not sure), For these that ad
mitted having had sex with their
boy friends I asked, “At what
point in your relationship did you
first have sex together?” You ab-
solutely would not believe what
has been going on right here un-
der our noses. You know all those
stories about your buddy meeting
a girl, dating her a few times, and
then making the big score—forget
them. Somebody has committed a
grave honor violation. The range
for elapsed time before actually
hopping into bed was, catch this,
from one month to three years.

3.5 for 32 in 48...
Two-star Final

by J. G. FITZGERALD

Does anyone out there remem-
ber this column? We introduced it
last Winter and spent half the
term convincing people it was not
the title of a Chicago song. The
title referred to Mock Convention,
a process whereby a majority of
the student body spent 3.5 years
planning to spend 32 thousand
dollars in 48 hours.

The title was grossly inaccurate.
The MC actually spent $38 thous-
and inst of 32. The convention
itself took up about 30 hours—
including rack time—instead of
48. We were right about the three
and a half years of planning
though. Even now a registered
elite is sitting on the top floor of
the Student Center figuring out
how to go about second-guessing
the Republican party in 1980.

I got quite a bit of hassle about
the phrase “second-guessing”’
when I used it in reference to the
Mock Convention last year. The
chairman of the Massachusetts
delegation in particular, a mem-
ber of the PIKA house, took ex-
ception to my referring to the pro-
cess as second-guessing the party
out of power. He said they were
actully “predicting” what the De-
mocrats would do last summer.

Mr .Webster, the writer of lexi-
‘cons, not the frosh E.C. rep. last
year, said that (def. 2a.) second-
guess means to predict. In which
case the MC did a good job of

seecond-guessing the Demo party.
It may not seem relevant now that
we have a new president, but it is
still enlightening to look at how
well the last MC at W&L foretold
what the July “real-world” con-
vention would do.

Just after the Ohio primary, the
one that many observers said put
Jimmy Carter over the top in his
party, George Wallace endorsed
the present president. The second
ballot at the W&L convention
started off with the Alabama/
Wallace delegation going to Car-
ter. The late Mayor Richard Daly
came out for Carter about the
same time as Wallace. Illinois was
one of those states that put Carter
in the winner’s circle in Lexington
last spring. In fact, the entire se-
cond ballot at the last Mock Con-
vention was, as the W&L Alumni
Magazine noted in one issue, a
mirror-image of what would hap-
pen later in the real world, be-
tween the time of the last three
piimaries and the convention.

Some people may wonder why
we are finally getting around to
reporting how well the 1976 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Democratic
Convention did its job. It comes to
mind at this point in time because
Monday night is when the MC,
with the help of the E.C., finally
closed its 1976 books and made
the 1980 effort the affair of the
hour.

Letter To The Editor

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:
Sir:

In response to the letter from
Tony Carli in last week’s edition
of the Phi, I would like to make
the following observations. Mr.
Carli seems to believe it to be a
recognized fact that the E.C. erred
in some way with respect to the
case of Raynard Seott. However,
I am not aware that any of the
charges made by SABU or others
concerning procedural irregular
ties have been proved. I would re-
mind Mr. Carli that the E.C. has
not answered the charges and
Suggest that perhaps he has heard
only one side of the story. But for
this state of affairs, I must blame
the E.C. By refusing to answer the
allegations of procedural viola.
tions, the E.C. gives the impres
sion to Mr, Carli and others that
it indeed is guilty as charged. I
would hope that this it not the
case. If it is, the student body has
a right to know. If these charges
are not answered, rumors will per-
sist and horror stories of the E.C.'s
wrath will be passed on. This is
not the ideal environment for an
honor system.

Concerning Mr. Carli’s second
charge against the E.C., 1 would
only point out that the E.C. has
been very closed-mouth about the
entire case and as I have suggest.

was the membership of SABU
which chose such dramatic mea
sures to bring the case of Mr.
Seott into the public lime-light
If the black students had not made
their charges concerning the case

known most effectively in the
President's office, I doubt that the
facts of the case would have been

tions. While I do not deny the
right of Mr. Seott or any other
student to air any problems he
might have with the E.C.. he must
take the responsibility of any re-
sulting publicity of the case. The
E. C. is correct in its stand not to
release any facts concerning the

would have to wait for that magic
moment until the spring.

For the subjects who answered
negatively to the sex question I
asked, “why not?” Most of the

tion came before the E.C. from the
MC asking for about $700 from the
student body reserve fund to pay
debts left over from the 1976 con-
vention. $693.23, to be exact. Rep-
resenting the '76 MC we had Walt
Keiley, secretariat, now member
of the E.C., strangely silent about
left-over bills; Radar Davis, mem-
ber of the E.C. this year and last,
E.C, rep. to the MC last year, and
strangely silent about why the
E.C, did not keep an eye on the
MC last year and prevent these
overexpenditures; Rick Wolf,
Ring-tum Phi drama critic and MC
co-chairman in charge of facili-
ties, looking dignified (he seemed
to think so anyway) and not really
saying anything about last year’s
convention.

Somewhere between the two
conventions sat Jim Lawson. He

was an administrative assistant

for the '76 show, and is co-chair-
man with John Trump of the in-
terim planning for the 1980 ef-
fort.

Then on the other side we had
Trump. Trump sat in the hot-seat,
being questioned by the E.C.
about Ahe debts his predecessors
hed teft him, and looking like
nothing quite so much as John
Trump. Beside him, doing most of
the talking and taking most of the
flack from the E.C., sat Jim Me-
Nider, treasurer for the 1980 fes-
tivities, a very nervous individual
from all appearances, more an ac-
countant than an apologist for the
man who held the job before him.

We have never been afforded a
sight of the E.C., the SAB or any
other student committee in this
stale of flux, the old, the new and
ithe transition sitting in one room.
Given the sight, I for one was dis-
appointed. Nothing substantive
eame of the meeting. There was
no passing of the torch, only a
sharing of the blame. The new MC
people explained how the old ran
up massive debts in the last min-
utes of last Spring's deal.

Generals gain 19th win;
beat RMC in photo-finis

By BARBARA MINNIG

Last Wednesday, W&L basket-
ball fans discovered that they
don’t have to travel half a mile to
see the best basketball team in
Lexington. In what was billed as
the game of the year, W&L turn-
ed back a powerful Randolph-
Macon squad, 75-73, in a thriller
which matched two of the finest
small college teams in the state.
Coming into the game the Gen-
erals were 17-2 on the year and
ranked 7th in the nation in Divi-
sion III, while the Yellowjackets
were 14-4 and honorable mention

in Division . Instrumental in the
team’s victory was*the enthusias-
tic support of the largest, and
most boisterous crowd of the year.

From the beginning of the game
it was apparent that Randolph-
Macon would not blow W&L out
by 25 points as they had last year
in Ashland. Ardith Collins made
this explicit when he brought the
crowd to its feet with a break
away slam dunk early in the first
half. Dave Leunig and Bob Flint
played their usual consistently
fine games, taking the game to
Randolph-Macon’s two standout

Two-star final

(Continued from Page 2) :
the second session. Miss Virginia
cost over a hundred bucks. Teel
was free. The bill was left for the
1980 MC. President Huntley held a
reception the evening before the
convention. The bill was forward-
ed to the 1976 MC, from whence
it was forwarded to the 1980 com-
mittee.

There was more. There were
2000 copies of the "76 MC Journal
left over. Lumber from a local
building supply store and flowers
and flags from a national supplier
of decorations made the parade a
crowd-pleaser. And made the 1980
effort debt-ridden. After a half-
hour of debate Monday night the
E.C. voted to make good the debt
from their reserve fund, a fund
designed to pay for deficits in stu-
dent body budgets in any activity.
No torch was passed, they just
closed the books.

Meaning the books are now
open on the 1980 Washington and
Lee Mock Republican Convention.
So far they have $200 from the
student tax to work with. They
also have $10,000 from the Sum-
ners Foundation, the political sci-
ence study group in Texas that
gave 12 grand to the ’76 MC, an
amount roughly equivalent to the
entire budget for 1972. They were,
according to the treasurer for last
year’s event, speaking to the Phi
last year, supposed to have a few
thousand surplus from the previ-
ous convention.

A few thousand which may as
well be forgotten as we look for-
ward to the next convention. They

have their disadvantages. In 1976
the contacts and sources cultivat-
ed in the 1972 planning could be
used again. Next time we change
parties, and the information ma-
chine will have to start at ground
zero. But there is one of the ad-
vantages. Since the next one will
be a Republican convention and
this is, beyond a doubt, a Republi-
can student body, people in the
real world may talk a bit more
freely. It will be easier to pass a
platform, a task that was left un-
done in the middle of the night at
the ’'72 and "76 events. Of course
the effect of a Republican student
body works both ways: they may
have trouble being objective about
the whole deal.

John Trump, who will graduate
a year before the next convention,
outlined those pros and cons to a
reporter who will graduate two
years before the’deal comes down
in 1980. He outlined them after a
meeting with an Executive Com-
mittee, all of whose members, save
one, will graduate before the next
convention.

Somewhere out there is a fresh-
man who will take the reins for
the next MC and try to pick some-
one to run against Carter in 1980.
We hope he and his colleagues will
be as accurate as the 1976 crew—
they picked the right veep for the
first time in MC history—and will
leave a little more behind. I wish
him luck as we finally close the
books on the 1976 Washington and
Lee Mock Democratic Convention.
Like the man said, “The future is
in front of us.”

The W&L wrestlers ran their

season record to 10-3 with decisive
30-12 and 30-15 wins over David-
son and Catawba respectively this
past weekend.
. Several team members did ex-
ceptionally well, most notably cap-
tain Jim Crytzer, who set a school
record of 62 career victories with
two wins on the trip, surpassing
Doug Ford’s (75) mark of 61.

Also standing out were fresh-
man Boyd Breeding, who recorded
two victories by pins in the 118
weight class, and junior Howdy
Knipp who came back from a
hand injury to take dual wins in
in the 126 class. Freshman Todd
Wohler had successive triumphs
in the 167 division.

All did not go well for the Gen-
erals, however. As the team was
leaving for Catawba on Saturday
morning, it was discovered that
sophomore Tom Oxendine was
missing. A thorough search failed
to locate the absent wrestler, and
it was decided that the “lost
sheep” was to be left behind in
order to make the match in David-
son.

Filling the gap in the 177 weight
division for Oxendine was another
sophomore, Ed Rodgers. Ed did
not fare too well himself, as mid-
way through his match he severely
hurt his knee. (It was later dis-
covered ‘that, true to the W&L
spirit, Oxendine had been “study-
ing” a book, and failed to notice
the time).

“Overall it was a great showing
for the entire team,” said junior
Howdy Knipp, “it should give us
good momentum going into the
last part of the season.” The next
match for the matmen will be
away against Madison College on
Wednesday, Feb. 16. This match
will serve as a preparation for the
ODAC Tournament coming up
“eb. 23 at Doremus Gymnasium.

seconds left Larson started his
move to the basket, but was forced
to the corner where he fired a fif-
teen foot jumper which clinched
the victory. The crowd went wild,
pouring on to the floor in celebra-
tion. However, Randolph-Macon
had called time out with 4% second
left in the game though the clock
showed :00. Their full court in-
bounds pass was intercepted by
Pat Dennis which guaranteed the
75-73 victory.

Saturday night W&L extended
its winning streak to 12 with a 88-
74 victory over Maryville. Pat
Dennis led all scorers with 32
points, hitting 16 from the field.

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

Mermen defeated
but Choppers win

by BOB LYFORD

The W&L aquamen took time
out from their rigorous training
for the Nationals to host defend-
ing state champion Virginia Com-
monwealth University in a specta-
cular home meet this past Friday.
W&L lost the meet, 58-55, but “it
was a great team effort against a
tough team,” according to one
team member.

In fact, three team members re-
corded their best times ever. Bob
Newcomb swam his best time in
the 50 yd. freestyle event in his
third place finish. Chip Hoke fin-
ished second in the .900 yd. free-
style event, and just missed quali-
fying for the Nationals as he main-
tained his finest pace in his sec-
ond place finish in the 500 free.
Also, Keith Romich set a school
record in his third-place finish in
the 200 yd. fly, while winning the
200 yd. freestyle event.

The lone double-winner was
John Hudson in both the 500 yd.
and 1000 yd. freestyle events.
Coach Stearns commented that
“the sprinters are beginning to
swim well.” Tad Van Leer finish-
ed second in the 50 yd. and 100

yd. freestyle events, also record-
ing excellent times. Drew Pills-
bury finished third in both the
200 I-M and the 200 backstroke
events, and Peter Meem came in
third in the 200 yd. backstroke.
Also, Gordon Ross took second in
both diving events.

Despite these superb individual
performances, it was perhaps the
famous “Chopper” relay which
generated the most excitement.
This relay, entirely composed of
members of the Lambda Chi Al-
pha fraternity—Chip Hoke, Bob
Newcomb, Scott Duff, and Keith
Romich—edged VCU in a close
contest and in the process quali-
fied for the Nationals. Chip Hoke
called the Chopper relay the “best
fraternity relay team in. the na-
tion.”

Thus, although Bill Greg satiri-
cally stated “we’re psyched for
missing Fancy Dress” in reference
to the state meet to be held that
weekend — his real sentiments
could be detected when he further
commented that “we're a small
team with big ideas.” So, W&L
will be carrying a good season
record into the State Meet.

Generals run close second
in first indoor track meet

by JERRY HARRIS

Let the word go out. The Wash-
ington and Lee track team will be
a force to reckon with in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference if
their performance Saturday is any
indicator. The Generals finished a
close second to Lynchburg while
easily outdistancing Davidson and
Roanoke in the first indoor track
meet of the season for W&L.

Traditionally, W&L has treated
the indoor season as a practice
ground for the outdoor season.
And as this approach might indi-
cate, the Generals usually don’t do
well in the indoor season. How-
ever, this year’s squad appears to
be one of W&L’s best as was illu-
strated in the Davidson meet.

Despite the absence of several
key performers, the Generals
scored 69 points, just behind Lyn-
chburg’s 74 point total. Davidson
and Roanoke were far behind with
35 and three points respectively.
Even though the score shows

‘otherwise, the squad members and

coaches looked upon it as a vie-
tory. Certainly, it was the best in-
itial indoor performance that
W&L has ever had and could
have been better if not for in-
juries.

Co-eaptain John Tucker spoke
for the team, saying, “We won it.

referring to the absence of Paul

Thompson's times in the 880 are
the best in the conference while
both Scott and Burns are top fin-
ishers in the league in the long
jump and three mile run respec-
tively.

W&L was swept in the long
jump and triple jump events while
managing only third place in two
other events but their balanced
strength in the sprints, weight
events and relays made up the dif-
ference. The Generals are now

tie for having the most ROTC
members. Of the student body,
60% are fraternity members.

An analysis of academic majors
of the cadet juniors and seniors
shows the Arts have 45% of these
cadets, the School of Commerce
40%, the Sciences 10% and the
Law School 5%. Business-account-
ing and history are tied for most
popular major among these ca-
dets. This compares with school-
wide statistics for the same two
years when academic majors in
commerce and history far surpass
the other disciplines.

And the ‘geographical back-
ground of the cadets also com-
pares with that of the University-
students at large. In descending
order, the following four states
provide the bulk of the W&L ca-
dets: Virginia, Maryland, New
York and Pennsylvania. The four
states providing the greatest num-
ber of students to Washington and
Lee, in descending order, are Vir-
ginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and
New York.

These statistics show that the
make-up of the cadet corps virtu-
ally mirrors that of the student
body. The cadets come from neith-
er the upper nor the lower end of
the SAT or GPA spectrum. The
Cadet Corps represents a healthy

Their academic majors, fraternity
membership and geographical

background also parallel that of
the University student body. It fol-

isties, the cadet corps provides a

dent community.

cords were kept on how the ’76
convention was run.

Paul Larkin, senior EC repre-
sentative, pointed out that the
budget for the ’76 convention was
more than double the ’72 conven-
tion’s budget, yet the ’76 conven-
tion ended up with a deficit and
the ’72 convention had a $1,600
surplus.

The budget for ’72 was $18,000,
compared to the ’76 budget of
about $38,000, he said. He asked
why, given these statistics, the 76
convention could not stay within
its budget.

Rick Wolf, ’76 convention co-
chairman responded, ‘“The ’76 con-
vention was twice as good, twice
as accurate,” and in order to get
the quality they had to pay the
costs. McNider added that the ’72
convention had been given a sub-
stantial amount of money by the
Sumner Foundation after the con-
vention was over, turning a pro-
spective deficit into a surplus.

Radar Davis suggested that the
EC loan the °76 convention the
money until it could be payed
back from contributions. MeNider
said that wouldn't close the books

on ’76 which was what he was
there to do.

Stradtman said the most dis-
turbing part of the financial re-
port was the cost of the Mock Con-
vention Journal. Lawson acknowl-
edged that 2,000 extra copies of
the magazine were still around, as
well as a lot of ’76 Mock Conven-
tion stationary.

He said however, that the items
represented only about $1,000 out
of the total budget of $37,000, and
that other Mock Convention de-
cisions, such as the decision to
make Mock Convention T-shirts,
were profitable ones.

Finally, Neil Pontifallo moved
that the EC give the Mock Conven-
tion the $693.23 requested. The
motion passed, with only Larkin
and Davis dissenting.

In other action, Jacob Jones
presented two petitions to the
EC. One asks for a student refer-
endum to decide the question of
whether or not seniors should be
allowed to vote in the upcoming
“big three” elections for EC presi-
dent, vice president and secretary.

The other petition asks for a
referendum to decide whether or
not freshmen should have two rep-
resentatives on the EC.

He has attended almost every
election and initiation since 1915,
and estimates that there are about
152 ODK chapters at colleges and
universities today. Although the
chapters tend to be concentrated
in the south and mid-west, the or-

average of two additional chapters

An expert on the question of
free press and fair trial, Paul C.
Reardon, retired justice of the Su-
preme Court of Massachusetts,
will speak at 8:15 p.m. on the
{opie “Fair Trial: The Conflict Be-
tween the First and Sixth Amend-
ments to the United States Con-
stitution.”

He will speak in the Moot Court
Room in Lewis Hall.

Reardon, who retired from the
Massachusetts high court at the
beginning of this year, is the au-

when he retired at the mandatory
age of 70. Latture now serves as
assistant in the president’s office,
where he deals with matters con-
cerning alumni and trustees.

What does he have to say about
his function in the administrative
machinery of Washington and
Lee? He smiled slightly and, un-
able to conceal his amused tone,
assessed the situation: “I’m just
hanging around, looking after
these boys who are running Wash-
ington and Lee now.”

ers was not the important one.
She said that the mixer issue
pointed out the problem of the
dwindling number of women in
the law school.

Bar Association forced W&L Law
School into sex blindness. Since
then the women have had to do
their own recruiting, with SBA
funds. They claim that this should
not be their responsibility.

Two years ago out of a class of
80 there were only 11 women.
This year out of an enlarged class
of 120 there were still 11 women
who entered. This is over a 30%
drop from the previous year.

The WLSO said that it will take

further action if their proposals
are not considered.

Last week 2001: A Space Oddy-
sey showed on the tube. Stanley
Kubrick’s other masterpiece, Dr.
Strangelove, will play in Reid Hall
at 7 and 9 p.m. The movie is for
free and stars George C. Scott and
Peter Sellers, among others, in a
spoof of Fail-Safe. The flick ex-
plores what would happen if a
pilot who looked like Slim Pickens
dropped a big bomb on top of a
Russian doomsday machine. En-
joyable stuff for incurable pessi-
mists, Kubrick fans, and interna-
