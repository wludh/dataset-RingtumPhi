Fertilizer hits ventilator
on pot penalties question
EC member smokes in protest

by LEE HOWARD

Lighting up and smoking what
appeared to be a marijuana cigar-
ette, Rick Goddard told the Execu-
tive Committee Monday night that
the stricter marijuana sanctions
imposed recently by the Student
Control Committee were “fool-
ish.”

The freshman law representa-
tive’s action was followed by more
than half an hour of heated de-
bate that ended when the E. C.
voted to hold a student body meet-
ing about pot rules in the Spring.

Goddard said the most foolish
thing about the rules is that they
apply only to the dorms. “T’ll give
my key to anyone who wants to
smoke here in the E.C. room,” he
said.

He said there’s never been an
agreement between police and
W&L that there will be no drug
raids on campus. That argument
for the legitimacy of the commit-
tee’s action “is a fallacy,” he said.
He said he got his information
from Lexington Police Chief J. A.
Kirby.

Dean and police chief
discuss enforcement

The reaction has been swift and
definite to last week's article on
the Student Control Committee’s
unanimous decision to stiffen the
penalties for smoking pot in the
dorms. The E.C, debated the mat-
ter Monday night and set up a
student body meeting for April
(see accompanying story). Stu-
dent Control President Bill Craver
wrote a letter giving the commit-
tee’s side of the story (see p. 2).
And the R-tP reporter who wrote
last week's story talked to Dean
of Freshmen William A. Noell and
Lexington Police Chief J. A. Kirby
about drug laws and their enforce-
ment on and off campus.—

by RANDY SMITH

Dean William A. Noell said in
in interview Monday, that he
viewed the Student Control Com-
mittee’s stated reasons for more
stringent penalties as a “possible
overreaction.”

When asked if the drug problem
in the freshman dormitories con-
stituted “widespread, illegal acti
vities,’” Dean Noell replied that,
in his perception, there had been
a few more cases brought to Stu
dent Control's attention than in
past years. “That's the only gauge
I have as to how widespread or

”

nonwidespread the problem is,
he said.

“If you make the assumption
that counselors, over the course of
two or three years, have been uni-
formly diligent in enforcing the
rule, and you are confronted with
the situation that there are more
reported cases this year than in
the past, then you will inevitably
reach the conclusion that there is
a little more marijuana smoking
in the dorms than there has been
in the past. But the assumption
that counselors are uniformly dili-
gent about that, year in-year out,
is a bad assumption,” he warned.

Asked if one could infer from
his comments that he thought the
Student Control Committee hod
overreacted, he said that he was
not quite sure he could accept the
word overreacted. “But their char-
acterization of the drug situation
as ‘widespread,’ strikes me as a
possible overreaction. Our posi
tion is that they are beter equipp
ed to judge, and I would not be
inclined to second-guess them as
long as that is the policy.”

In a conversation with Lexing-
ton Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the Ring-tum Phi was seemingly
assured that the police would not

Another foolish thing about the
committee’s action is that it at-
tacks marijuana smokers, not has-
hish or cocaine users, he said.
Also it ignores other Virginia laws
such as the one against use or pos-
session of liquor by anyone under
21 and fornication and seduction
laws, he said.

It’s the lack of consistency
which bothers him, he said.

Goddard urged any student who
was found with marijuana to sue
his dorm counsellors for trespass-
ing.

Mike Cleary, president of the
junior class and a member of Stu-
dent Control, said none of the
counsellors who have found stu-
dents smoking marijuana have
trespassed. He said one case was
discovered when a counselor went
to a freshman’s room at 3 a.m. to
ask him to turn down his stereo.

Even straight counsellors don’t

CBS correspondent Charles Kuralt

Kuralt discusses consciousness

Speaking with the humor and
charm which has popularized his
CBS series “On the Road,” Charles
Kuralt Tuesday said he has notic-
ed in his 10 years “On the Road”
a “strengthening of American
public consciousness.”

Kuralt, speaking to about 200
persons packed into Lee Chapel,
said this new public consciousness
is “a change you notice every-
where.” Ile said there are no more
“silent majorities’ or “silent
generations” (a term he said is a
propo to his own generation “even
if Time did coin it”),

He cited the example of Joel
Kean who formed a group called
“Pop's Snow Squad” which shovel
ed the driveway and walkway for
an old man without letting the
man know who was doing it.

rhis public consciousness “has
become the rule rather than the
exception,” Kuralt said, because
people have come to realize that
“one man or one woman can make
all the difference.” He cited the
example of Ralph Nader starting
ihe consumer movement virtually
on his own with his book Unsafe
at Any Speed. He said the book
Silent Spring began the ecology
movement in a like manner

Kuralt said the past 10 years

However, he said, journalists

have “no time for a calm back-
ward glance, they are always look-
ing to the future.” Therefore the
news is always “crisis-ridden,” he
said

Life is not crisis-ridden, he said.
It is Kuralt’s job to cover life. As
he said “It is my duty to make
sure no swimming pig goes unre
marked.”

Kuralt said he was under in-
struction that if he ever stumbled
upon a “real story I should find a
real reporter.” The big stories? “I
have missed them all,” he said. He
was in a gas station in Alaska
when Nixon resigned and in a la
trine in Vietnam when he learned
(three days late) that
landed on the moon.

But he has caught all the little
stories, like “worm-grunting” in
Sopchopee, Fla. Not that the citi
zens of Sopchopee thought worm
grunting was a small story. In fact
one citizen said when the CBS
film crew came to Sopchopee, ac
cording to Kuralt, “I knew you
guys would show up sooner or
later.”

Pratt money
being spent
for raises’ aid

by WILLIAM H, EDMISTEN

W&L stil does not have access
to the principal of John Pratt’s
nearly $12 million bequest made
last year, according to Treasurer
James W. Whitehead.

But he said the university does
have “authority for direction of
the principal.” The 60-part invest-
ment portfolio “is getting active
investment attention at all times”
he said and the contents of the
portfolio change from day to day.

Assistant Treasurer Louis V.
Snyder said W&L has received
$686,000 in earnings from the

principal since the bequest was
made. In accordance with Pratt’s
will, the W&L Board of Trustees
appropriated $450,000 to increase
faculty salaries and $100,000 for
scholarships and financial aid for
this academic year, Whitehead
said.

Dean of the College William J.
Watt said he didn’t know the
average salary increase of a pro-
fessor and information about in-
dividual salaries is confidential.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said the Pratt money gave W&L’s
financial aide program “a shot in
the arm.” He said W&L was “able
to meet all the needs of those
who applied and were accepted

. which otherwise we wouldn’t
have been able to do.”

Pratt requested, but did not
exact in his will, that W&L use
the funds within 25 years after his
death. Whitehead said the Board
of Trustees is now studying “the
unlimited considerations that wi!l
have to be weighed” with regard
to spending the principal.

The dispersion of the near $12
million principal was delayed b
an niece of Pratt’s who conteste ]
the will but who eventually settled
out of court. Now the dispersio:
of the money could go forward
any day, according to Whitehead

THE RING-TUM PHi

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, March 24, 1977

What?

early in the Fall term | proposed a reorganizational scheme
for the University based on the interrelatedness of the various
academic disciplines. No one took it too seriously.

In retrospect | see that my plan, while perhaps making
sense as far as it went, was an attack on the symptoms of the
underlying problem and not on the problem itself.

The problem? The failure of this University to encourage
and develop independent and creative thinking.

No mere reshuffling of departments is going to strike at the
root of this problem.

What are the roots of this problem? Where do they lie?
They extend deep into man’s consciousness and back into his
past. The problem stems from the very ways we think about
things, modes of thought that are so old and comfortable and
familiar that we can no longer see them for what they are—
intellectual tools with limited application—but instead let
them define our world for us.

These modes of thought are so deeply imbedded that it’s
very difficult to recognize them, identify them, see them in
anything but their own context. The very composition of this
essay is being shaped by the kind of thinking I’ve been taught
to do since day one, and any sort of departure from these
traditional modes is viewed at best as eccentricity; if the
departure is radical enough, as insanity.

We are locked into narrow channels of rationality which
prevent us from seeing any other ways of thinking and even
irom seeing that there could even be other ways of thinking.
\ll of this must sound abstract and highflown, but it is really
vital and basic if we are genuinely concerned with with
becoming “educated.”

What are some of these self-limiting ways of thinking I
seem so worried about? Good question...one of them is
called subject-object dualism. This mode of thought presumes
that there exists an unbridgable gap between oneself and the
rest of the world. Most of our thinking about reality is based
on this distinction, a distinction which itself has no “objective”
validity. How can a subject be objective? Objectified? Why
should he be? The great body of scientific knowledge, and the
scientific. method itself—empiricism—grows out of this mania
for “objectivity.” This attitude pervades more than just
science, however, In all disciplines we are taught to examine
things according to how they have been done by others in the
past. We study the methods for doing things but not the rea-
son; we are handed a set of conclusions without questioning
the steps leading to those conclusions.

There is much, much more to all this. All I ask is that we
begin to think about the way we think. To broaden the base
of our thinking would be a giant step towards gaining the
education we all came here for.

Pot

Not since the Great Lexington Spinners War of 1976 have
“o many become so aroused over so little. The personal feei-
ing of this writer is that if there is any place in the world
where he would least like to smoke dope, the freshman dormi
tory is it. But that is not the issue in this case. Some cofisider
the issue to be one of principle, others think it one of harass-
ment, still others worry about matters of law and some just
like to argue. From here, it looks like the central issue is that

RDI.

there is an issue,

The E.C. has scheduled a student body meeting for the
first week after the break to discuss the new Student Control
Committee rules on smoking marihuana in the dorms, The
meeting is to be held in Lee Chapel so there will be enough
room for the large number of people who seem to have strong
views on the subject, Now, just as in the Spinners War, we
at least have a chance to temporarily squelch rampant rumors
of widespread student apathy. The main problems with the
C's arrangements are that the meeting should he located
in the Cockpit and that they neglected to announce who's

buying the papers. Ea

The Ring-tum Phi Survey

By GARY HALEY

This week, as promised, the
Ring-tum Phi Survey moved down
the road to Sweet Briar College.
Here, as at Mary Baldwn College,
a representative sample of the
student body was surveyed con-
fidentially to discern attitudes,
opinions, and experiences of the
ladies from the other side of
Route 60.

Sweet Briar, probably more
than any other area school, has
long suffered from stereo-typing
by outside observers. Everyone
knows that all the girls at SBC
ride horses, have nice cars, have
plenty of money, and don’t always
have sweet dispositions. I found
this not to be fully true: they
don’t all ride horses, they don’t
all have cars, and they don’t all
have plenty of money. Three out
of four is not bad!

The text of this week’s survey
centers around the theme of how
these SBC students judge others
and how they actually view them-
selves. One of the first questions
dealing with how they view them-
selves was ‘“Whait do you consider
your best personal talent?” Be-
lieve it or not, all the answers
were printable. The actual replies
were as varied as individual per-
sonalities, but by far the most
popular reply dealt with their
gift of gab, conversational abili-
ties, and ease in getting along
with others (40 percent). The next
most common answer dealt with

atheletic ability, specifically out-
door sports such as riding horses
(20 per cent). This was followed
by 10 per cent who felt they had
no one particular best talent and
10 per cent who felt their best
personal talent was their ability
to draw, paint, sculpt, ete. The
remaining percentiles were oc-
cupied by ideas such as work
motivation, voice quality, leader-
ship abilities, and generosity.

Following up on this personal
talents idea, I asked the ladies,
“What can you brag about to
your friends?” A full 43 per cent
answered that they choose not to
brag to anyone at anytime. Fol-
lowing this, 16 per cent brag
about their “weekend husbands.”
Another 15 per cent brag about
their musical talents, especially
their voices. Beyond this 10 per
cent brag about their G.P.A.s and
10 per cent brag about their
artistic abilities. Filling out the
remaining percentages are brags
about atheletic abilities, riding,
dancing, clothes, cooking, and
even quitting smoking.

Next I asked the girls what
impressed them, particularly per-
taining to guys. The overwhelm-
ing answer pertained to the per-
sonality of the guy in question
(46 per cent). The distant and
trailing replies: 13 per cent felt
that honesty was the most im-
pressive characteristic in a guy;
this was followed by good looks
(nine per cent). Another nine per

per cent were impressed most
when a guy did not “try to get
me in bed.”

Finally, I asked these lovelies
of SBC to what degree several
basic characteristic of guys affect-
ed their dating preferences. There
was a list of ten basic criteria.
Only one of these characteristics
affected their preferences “a lot.”
This was personality. All of those
surveyed replied that the person-
ality of a guy affects their pre-
ferences a lot. This was followed
by “overall appearance” and “in-
tellect” which affected their pre-

ferences a lot-to-some. This was
rather closely followed by ‘sex
appeal” and believe it or not, beer
drinkers, “weight.” Items that
turned out to effect preferences
only “a little’ were “hometown,”
“fraternity,” and “wealth.” It
would seem that the old rumors
about fraternal differentiation of
dating preferences and the ideas
of “preferred houses” is not all
that prevalent any more. Some
other items that had no affect on
dating preferences were clothes,
height, “swilling capacity” and
“gatoring techniques.”

Bugliosi discusses
Manson, Kennedy

by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

Last Wednesday, Vincent Bug-
liosi, the third speaker in the Con-
tact series, spoke about his book,
Helter Skelter, and the assassina-
tion of Robert Kennedy. Address-
ing a full house in Lee Chapel,
which was very receptive, Bug-
liosi did a fine job of summarizing

Helter Skelter, the story of the’

Charles Manson murders. Manson
and four members of his “family”
were tried for killing seven peo-
ple, collectively termed the Tate-
LaBianca murders. Deputy D. A.

Charles Fletcher Murray:
the shadow man knows all

By M. GRAY COLEMAN

On every college campus, there
is an individual who serves as the
general “trouble-shooter.”. W&L
is extremely lucky to have such
a person, a man who handles un-
ruly freshmen, distempered dogs,
outraged deans, and Old George
equally well. You know, there are
many students who are not fa-
miliar with the name Charles
Fletcher Murray, University Proc-
tor and Director of University
Security. But just say the name
Murph .. . freshmen subside,
deans put away their aspirin bot-
tles for an hour, and life goes on
here on the hill.

In response to the question,
“What does the Proctor do?’’, one
faculty member replied, “Every-
thing.” Yet, Murph was orginally
hired in the late 1950's with a
particular duty in mind. At that
time, the faculty decided to crack
down on the rising unruly con-
duct (particularly among fraterni-
ties). City police had begun to
threaten that, unless the school
took steps, they would have to
intervene in our affairs (reluct-
antly, of course). Mr. Murray,
then a city policeman himself, de-
cided to take on the job at W&L
and try his hand at friendly dis-
cipline.

The prospects for this were
bleak, though. When word got out
that one of “Lexington’s finest”
was actually coming on campus to
police student behavior, misgiv-
ings ran high. But, slowly, Murph
established a rapport with the en-
tire Washington and Lee com-
munity that others will only hope
to attain. From his office in
Doremus Gymnasium, he went out
every day at a long job—in fact,
even today at the writing of this
story, it was impossible for three
administrators to tell the Phi
exactly how many hours Murph
does put in. There are the usual
daytime hours, but a lot of his
work involves weekend evenings,
holidays, ad infinitum,

For those of you with an auto,
the name of Murph takes on a
special significance. Yes, the
“shadow man” is the one who
leaves those little pink slips all
over campus—an  unenviable
honor at best. But it may be of
some consolation to learn that
some of the worst offenders have
not been students at all. The
Proctor can, and does, ticket fac
ulty, and will even suggest to
Dean John which ones need a good
“talking to” concerning car eti-
quette,

Also, he has always had an un-
canny sense of knowing what's in
all our minds before we can put
our ideas into action. The recent
painting of “Old George” will
serve as an example of this. The
individuals in question had waited
until late, and were industriously
painting away when a hazy pres

ence was spotted, chuckling up
at them from the ground. “Is that
you, Murph?” “Yep.” But only
waiting to make sure the boys
didn’t hurt themselves—he knew
all along that they were going to
take care of “Old George’s” re-
painting... He knows us all too,
too well.

As one dean commented, “What
amazes me is how well he is able
to track down culprits, whether
townie thieves during vacations or
rowdies in fraternity parties.” In-
deed, Murph’s batting average
shadows that he recovers the
goods or discovers the guilty party
well over half the time. And he,
all by himself, is the reason fra-
ternities are tolerated as much as
they are by the city cops. It is
noise down at parties—acting as
a liaison to head things off be-

LETTERS TO

Dear Editor:

Most educators consider diver-
sity within the student body to be
a distinct advantage for all who
participate in the academic com-
munity. As a member of the ad-
missions committee, I recently
completed a review of financial
need and merit scholarship ap-
plicants. Based on the efforts of
administrators, alumni, and stu-
dents, the numbers and quality of
applicants represent a dramatic
improvement over previous years.
Many schools comparable to W&L
are actively pursuing these stu-
dents.

Over the past weekend many of
the black student applicants visit-
ing the campus attended the Black
Awareness Ball. The ball was a
success in all dimensions except
one—the absence of faculty and
white students. For those out-
spoken critics of black student
isolation, the invitation was ex-
tended to all, the isolation was
never more obvious than on Satur-
day night, the administration was
well represented. Where were
you? In particular, the absence of
student leaders and faculty was

The University’s progress over
the past ten years is remarkable,
representing the best efforts of
many dedicated individuals. In
seeking to attract and to main-
tain a diverse student body of
qualified young men, we need the
best efforts of student and faculty

Dear Sir:

One of the duties of the Student
Control Committee is to enforce
the University policy concerning
marijuana in the dorms. The Uni-
versity, for whatever reasons,
actively prohibits marijuana in
the dormitories. The strict state-
ment of policy issued March 8 by
the Committee has a dual purpose.
First, to stop persons from smok-
ing marijuana in the dorms, and
second, to be fair in our means
of accomplishing this task.

As Chairman of the Committee,
! spoke to the freshman class dur-
ing their orientation at Natural
Bridge. One of the few points that
| stressed was the University
policy concerning pot in the
dorms. I did not state a specific
penalty at the time. At the be
ginning of January, the Commit
lee heard its first two cases jn.
volving persons smoking pot in
the dorms, and assessed to them
the same penalty that last year’s
committee had awarded in their
first cases. In an effort to be sure
that the freshmen were aware of
the University policy concerning
marijuana in the dorms, 1, repre.
senting the Committee, wrote a
letter to the Ring-tum Phi stating
that we had penalized two fresh
men for smoking pot in the dorms

(Continued on page 4,

convictions and the death penalty
for all five defendants. The Su-
preme Court later declared the
death penalty unconstitutional, so
the sentences were commuted to
life imprisonment.

Although it was apparent from
the questions that much of the
audience had not read Helter
Skelter, some of the inquiries
proved interesting. Because of the
sentence reduction to life impri-
sonment, the Tate-LaBianca kill-
ers are eligible to apply for parole
next year. With this in mind, the
question was raised of whether
Bugliosi’s life style would signifi-
cantly change when Manson and
his followers were paroled. “Not
‘eally,” he replied. “I don’t have
any great fear of the Manson fam-
ily. I did have a bodyguard for
about a year and a half, but
they're not going to get out for a
great many more years.” In re-
sponse to a question on the cur-
rent status of the “family,” Bug-
liosi reported that nearly every
hard core member was behind
bars and “for all intensive pur-
poses, the Manson family has been
decimated.”

One other interesting area
prompted by an inquiry dealt with
Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, who
was the acting head of the “fam-
ily” after Manson’s arrest, and the
would-be assassin of President
Ford. “I had said several times
that Squeaky was the head of the
Manson family in Manson’s ab-
sense, that she was very danger-
ous, and that she should be watch-
ed and was not being watched.
Then the President comes to town
(Sacremento), and no one is watch-
ing Squeaky or the family. And, in
addition to that, Squeaky is wear-
ing a red robe and a red cape,
walks right up and no one says
‘Boo.”’ Now, here’s the Secret
Service, who are supposed to be
guarding the President, and she
walks right up wearing a red robe
and red cape. They should have
said, ‘Now who is this person?’ It’s
unbelievable that they would per-
mit someone like Squeaky From-
me to get within two feet of the
President. And there were some
members of the press who were
there and who recognized her be-
cause they had covered the Man-
son case in L.A., and they said:
: “Wonder what Squeaky’s doing

ere,’ ”

Later, a reception was held in
Fairfax Lounge, where Bugliosi
discussed the RFK assassination.
The big problem deals with the
possibility of a second gun (other
than Sirhan’s). Ballistics experts
do not agree on whether the bul-
lets recovered are from Sirhan’s
gun, could be from Sirhan’s gun,
or are not from Sirhan’s gun.
There is another problem with the
number of shots fired. Sirhan had
an eight-shot pistol, and did not
have time to reload and fire again
once those eight shots were fired.
There is a possibility of 12-14 bul-
let holes, but there is now no way
to check that out since much of
the evidence, including a partition
containing several possible bullet
holes, was destroyed, as were var-
lous other records concerning the
ease, There may be one possible
means for clearing up the ques
tion of how many shots were fir-
ed. Although no film of the shoot
ing was made, an audio tape was
running at the time. This tape,
which was turned over to the FBI,
could answer the question simply
by listening and counting the
shots. For some reason, the tape
has been kept under wraps.

One thing which Bugliosi em-
phasized several times was the
beauty of W&L and Virginia, and
the good reputation that W&L has.
He said that if his son considers
a college outside of California, he
will recommend Washington and
Lee

Generals beat Kutztown,
prepare for Navy invasion

by BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s 24-5 la-
crosse romp over Kutztown State
Saturday really doesn’t make
much sense,

Here’s a team which is notori-
ous for starting every season as if
the first month of the schedule
didn’t matter, a team which seems
not to believe in scoring early and
often in any game, a team which
rarely exhibits an ability to put
an opponent away when such an
opportunity presents itself.

All the Generals did to discred-
it the legend of the “W&L slow
start” was to explode for five
goals within 2:58 of the game’s
outset, then reel off 12 tallies in
succession later in the contest to
send the Golden Bears back to
Pennsylvania wondering just what
had hit them.

“Just what the doctor ordered,”
said a smiling Jack Emmer to his
players after the game. “We went
out there loose, got things going
early, and made it a very enjoy-
able afternoon for ourselves.”

Emmer had voiced some con-
cern prior to the game that the
Generals had “taken a step back-
wards” in their outings with Vir-
ginia Tech and Mount Washing-
ton, and that the team needed to
get some momentum going in its
final week of action before exams,

The momentum began building
during tahe Generals’ game-open-
ing burst. Sophomore attackman
Chris Kearney turned the Wilson
Field crowd on with a pair of
goals just 12 seconds apart in the
opening minute, the first coming
on a spectacular one-hand bounce
shot from the right side of the
cage.

After midfielder Jay Sindler
worked free on an isolation play
for the third W&L tally, Johnny
Black took a Kearney feed and
scored from five yards out, then
teamed with Jack Dudley on a
give-and-go play to complete the
Generals’ stunning blitz.

After Kutztown cut the W&L
lead to four, 6-2, late in the quar-
ter, the Generals conducted a les-
son on the finer points of offen-
sive lacrosse. Winning nearly
every face off and keeping play in
their attack zone most of the time,
W&L reeled off 12 goals over the
next 28 minutes, including seven
in a near-perfect second quarter
in showing that they’re capable of
playing good lacrosse before April
1

One of the more pleasant as-
pects of the rout was W&L’s new-
found ability to capitalize on op-
position penalties. After experi-
encing some problems with the
man-up offense in the first three
games, W&L struck for five extra
man goals, including four during
the 12-goal run, against Kutztown.

“You might say we got our act
together on the EMO (extra man
offense), said co-captain Dudley,
who got a pair of goals off the
man-up situations. “We're starting
to work better as a unit, and I
know we'll keep improving thro-
ughout the year.”

Dudley and sophomore attack-
man Jeff Fritz led a 14-man par-
ade to the scorebook with three
goals apiece, while six W&L play-
ers ~~ Kearney, Sindler, Black and
freshmen Mike Schuler, Bill Ma-
hon, and Scott MecLam — each

scored twice. Kearney added four
assists, while Fritz and Charlie
Stieff contributed two assists
each.

John Greiner paced Kutztown,
0-1, with two goals.

W&L again received strong play
from its goalies. Charlie Brown
recorded nine saves in the first 30
minutes, while freshman Bob Cle-
ments, who saw some duty as a
faceoff specialist in the first half,
stopped ten shots after intermis-
sion.

Kutztown’s Mike Moralles kept
things from being worse for the
Golden Bears, if that’s possible,
with 17 saves.

* oh a

It might not match up to the
Maryland-Johns Hopkins rivalry,
or even that between Washington
and Lee and Virginia, but the la-
crosse feud that has developed be-
tween the Generals and the Naval
Academy is now recognized as one
of the more~spirited matchups in
all of college lacrosse.

Even though the two teams met
for the first time just four years
ago, players on both squads re-
gard the W&L-Navy game as one
of the biggest on their schedules.

The Generals hold the edge in
the series, 3-2, but the Midship-
men have won the last two meet-
ings, including last year’s 8-7
squeaker at Annapolis, which
went Navy’s way on a man-up goal
in the final 30 seconds.

Among the three W&L wins are
a pair of victories in NCAA tour-
nament quarterfinal games. The
Generals won what many call “the
most thrilling game ever played
on Wilson Field’ ’in the 1973 tour-
nament, 14-13, when midfielder
Chip Tompkins scored in the se-
cond sudden death overtime per-

iod. The following year, after
having beaten Navy 13-10 during
the regular season behind five
goals and four assists by attack-
man Dave Warfield, W&L again
ended the Middies’ championship
hopes, 11-9, as Warfield collected
four goals and two assists.

The only lopsided game in the
series came in 1975, when mid-
fielder Bob DeSimone ran through
the W&L defense for seven goals
in leading Navy to a 14-8 win. De-
Simone, a first-team All-American
as a sophomore that year, has
since taken his talents to Johns
Hopkins.

Naturally, part of the spark that
has fueled the rivalry is the pre-
sence of former W&L coach Dick
Szlasa as the Middies’ mentor.
Szlasa, the man responsible for
the start of the Generals’ rise to
lacrosse promience in the late
1960's, left Lexington after the
1972 season to take the head job
at Navy.

Since moving to Annapolis, Sz-
lasa has taken his team to the
NCAA tournament each season,
though Navy has not won the na-
tional title under him. The Mid-
dies got to the 1975 finals, but
were thrashed by Maryland, 20-13.

This will be the first time that
Szlasa has looked at a W&L team
that does not have any of his re-
cruits playing. Last year’s gradu-
ates were the last bunch Szlasa
brought to Lexington, the final
group able to get any satisfaction
out of beating the man who had
recruited them.

In a mild upset, Navy dropped
its opener to Rutgers Saturday,
9-7. The Middies played college di-
vision power Washington College
yesterday before making the trip
to Lexington.

Baseball Generals
win two, lose two

The 1977 W&L baseball Gen-
erals opened the new season with
a .500 week, defeating Virginia
Wesleyan 5-3, losing to Lock
Haven State 41, and splitting a
doubleheader with West Virginia
Tech, winning 4-1, and losing 2-0.
It's a three game week for the
diamond nine as they travel to
Bridgewater College for an ODAC
doubleheader on Tuesday, and
host Oneonta State of New York
at 3:00 p.m. on Friday.

Senior co-captain Dan West-
brook pitched the Generals to
their first win of the year allow-
ing six Va. Wesleyan hits, while
giving up only one earned run.
The W&L batsmen were led by
senior designated hitter Mickey
Clary with two hits and three
RBI's. Shortstop Ted Hissey and
centerfielder Rich Wiles each had
a pair of hits.

Base running errors hurt the
Generals in the Lock Haven set-
back, and freshman Chip Childs
suffered his first loss of the year
in a game which just as easily
could have gone the other way
Wiles scored the only W&L run
in the eighth.

After losing the first game to

W.Va. Tech on Saturday, the Gen-
erals came back to take the night-
cap 41 behind the pitching of
freshman Vie Shepherd who al-

THE RING-TUM PHI 3

 

Golfers’ week ends
with split record

by JOHN BERLEY

On Friday, March 11, the W&L
golf team went into its first match
against the team of Averrett Col-
lege, from Martinsville, Va. The
conditions for this match were
excellent for W&L, the home
course at Lexington Country Club
was in fair shape after the devas-
tating winter and the team’s gen-
eral attitude was tremendous, for
they are anticipating a great year.
Needless to say, things were go-
ing well for the team all the way
around and the first match proved
it. The W&L men, had the advan-
tage that the home course can
bring, but showed that they were
superior to even this advantage
and handily took the match by
close to 41 strokes.

After another week of practice
the team went off to Bedford, Va.,
for a match against the team of
Lynchburg College. The name of
the course was Ivy Hill, a name
which seems to connote ease, but
the actual conditions were far
from easy. Talking to Coach Les-
lie, head of the team, he indicated
that the course was very difficult
and that the match could come
down to within a few strokes. He
also indicated that the Lynchburg
team had a definite home advant-
age for the course was difficult
and the opposition has practiced
on it every day. Team captain
Jerry Maatman also felt that the
match would be trying, pointing
out that the course was, in his
estimation, one of the hardest in
Virginia. So it was on Saint Pat-
rick’s day that the team headed
for Bedford and one of the har-
dest matches of the season. Oh
yes, one minor oversight, the Lyn-
chburg team is excellent, which
added to the overall difficulty in
playing this match.

The course itself is very differ-

ent from most, for the front nine
is like playing in a cow pasture
with little or no flat area on any
of the rather broad fairways mak-
ing the second shots difficult, and
hills so high that they very effec-
tively hid most of the greens. The
back nine was another story all
together. It still had its share of
rolling Virginia hills but this time
the fairways were so tight that to
get an effective drive off the tee
you had to hook the ball to get it
around the dog legs. Also, any-
thing short of a perfect shot would
have you in a beautiful stand of
Virginia Pines or a_ babbling
brook. The greens were in good
shape, however, and as team mem-
ber Dave Leunig said, they were a

and voted for the amendment, but
Pltii Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Nu all switched to the
negative column, killing the eligi-
bility amendment and removing
the Red Square split that existed
the night before.

The amendment being offered
would have allowed any student
to run for the office of IFC presi-
dent. As the constitution reads
now, only rising seniors may seek
the post.

Only nine houses signed the
petition circulated by Jones’s
backers before the Wednesday
night meeting. The petition asked
Robinson to call a meeting of the
IFC, take a vote on the eligibility
amendment, then adjourn and call
another meeting immediately. The
IFC constitution says that any
amendment must be ratified by a
two-thirds vote of the 15 houses at
two successive meetings.

Fight houses voted for the
change on Tuesday night, and af-
ter the meeting Peter Quinn of
the SPE house and Howdy Knipp
of Delta Tau Delta said that they
would probably vote for the
amendment it it were offered
again. SPE did change on the sec-
ond, but the Delt house retained
its negative vote. Even though KA
switched as well the three Red
Square votes that changed were
enough to prevent the change.

Knipp said before the Wednes-
day meeting that he had started
his race for IFC vice-president
hoping he could do some good for
the frats. But he added that he
did not like having to take sides
and was having second thoughts
about the election and the amend-
ment.

Knipp still allowed his name to
be placed in nomination again, as
did KA Carter Greer. Greer had
said earlier he hoped he would be
the compromise candidate chosen
by the non-Red Square houses, but
added that he did not enjoy the
prospect of splitting the frater-
nities by running one faction
against another.

Greer Was nominated by his
frat brother, George Griffin, but

Griffin indicated afterward that
the move was a favor to Greer and
that he planned to support Mattes-
ky. He said he talked to several
people Tuesday night about nomi-
nating a candidate all the non-Red
Square houses could get behind
and Mattesky was the one they
chose.

Mattesky said after his nomina-
tion, “I hadn’t planned on running
to begin with. I didn’t know, being
a journalist, whether I.wanted to
get involved in administrative
matters.” He added, “I guess it
wasn’t too hard to talk me into it.”

and that we would increase the
penalty, if necessary, to enforce
the University policy. Another
case was brought before the Com-
mittee, and we handled it in the
same manner as the previous two.
About a month later, three more
cases were turned into the Com-
mittee, and in questioning the
freshmen involved, we found that
they had been aware of the Uni-
versity’s policy, and that they had
all either read or heard about
the letter I wrote to the Phi. It
was clear to the Committee that
our previous efforts to stop mari-
juana smoking in the dorms had
been ineffective.

Thus, in an effort to be fair
by making sure all dormitory resi-
dents knew of the new policy, we
issued the statement to all the
counselors so that they could
post it in their dorm sections.
Further, to accomplish our pur-
pose of stopping marijuana smok-
ing in the dorms, we issued a
policy incorporating penalties that
we felt would serve as a deterrent.

woman at one of the local col-
leges.

Cleary said he thought that case
was a turning point of the com-
mittee. Thereafter the committee
was much more strict in dealing
out penalties, he said.

The case involved two members
of SAE charged with spraying a
chemical fire extinguisher in the
face of a 65-year-old housemother
at Hollins, aceording to members
of Student Control. The penalty
handed down in that case was
lighter than the new minimum
penalties for smoking pot in the
dorms.

The new Student Control pen-
alties are a $50 fine, two weeks
social probation and a letter to
the offender's parents.

E.C. President-elect Jim Under-
hill said he did not think the issue
fell under the jurisdiction of the
E.C. but Vice-President-eleet
George Griffin moved that the
committee invite members of Stu-
dent Control to a student body
meeting in Lee Chapel after the
Spring break to discuss the prob-
lem. Griffin’s motion passed 8-2.

CAR TAGS

All students who have motor
vehicles at Washington and Lee
and who purchased local tags in
March or April of 1976 are re-
minded of the requirement to
purchase new tags prior to the
expiration of the ones currently
displayed.

A student whose local address
is within the city limits of Lex
ington is required to purchase a
decal from the City Treasurer's
Office at the Lexington City Hall
on East Washington Street. These
decals, which cost $10.00 each, are
good for a twelve-month period
from the date of purchase.

A student whose local residence
is in Rockbridge County is to pur-
chase his decal at the County
Treasurer's Office, located in the
County Court House Building on
Main St. All county tags, which
also cost $10.00, expire on Apri!
15 each year. State registration
papers for the automobile are re
quired at the time of purchase.

The only students exempt from
these licensing requirements are
Virginia residents who already dis-
play current local tags from a city
or county in the Commonwealth
of Virginia.

tivities, Kirby said: “They notify
us. It’s not exactly an agreement,
it is just something that we have
done for years. We do not go up
on the campus unless we are
called upon the campus by an of-
ficial of the school or the pro-
perty.”

However the police chief would
not comment when asked about
the possibilities of a ‘drug bust’
in the dormitories this year. He
also. withheld comment when
queried about the likelihood of a
drug investigation being conduct-
ed at this time.

Noell was reassuring in his an-
swer to the question of whether
the police would be summoned if
the Administration felt the drug
situation in the dorms was bad:
“T really don’t know. I’m not try-
ing to evade or avoid that ques-
tion, but I just haven’t confronted
that as a matter that I was going
to have to make a decision on be-
cause I really have not concluded
that we’ve got that kind of situa-
tion now nor in the forseeable fu-
ture. I don’t believe I would be in-
clined, as a matter of first in
stance, to handle it that way; |
think | would see if the school
could do something about it.”

teed up for the match and the
men from W&L went out with
high hopes. All the W&L tee shots
were good to excellent and it
seemed that the six members of
the team were off to great starts.
Th Lynchburg team on the other
hand-had some fine tee shots by
the team leaders but the rest of
the team was short or in the
rough. As the teams came in from
the front nine W&L was up by one
stroke. Then teeing up on the back
nine, the W&L team again had
as on the front, excellent tee shots
and the Lynchburg team had some
more initial trouble. However,
Uvnehburg’s familiarity with the
course was going to pay off for
them this day, and when the final
seores were in, Lynchburg had de-
feated the Generals by 11 strokes,
on the back nine.

The team is dormant for the
next couple of weeks until the
bulk of their season comes up in
the Spring. As for the prospects
of the season, Maatman says that
the team has a good chance to win
it all and that they are shooting
for that goal.

lowed only six hits. W&L could
muster only three hits in the open-
ing game loss, as Westbrook took
the pitching defeat. A four run
first inning was all W&L needed
in the second game. A bases load-
ed walk scored Wiles, two wild
pitches scored third baseman Bob
Szcaecinski and catcher Maynard
McCorkle, and first baseman Mike
Busbey doubled in rightfielder
Chuck D’Auria for the fourth
W&L tally.
