By LEE HOWARD

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night not to exclude
seniors from participating in the
“big three” elections until student
views on the subject are gauged
in a referendum before the stu-
dent body on its own initiative.

On a vote of 8-2, the E.C. de-
cided not to act on a proposal
made by Paul Larkin that seniors
he disenfranchised in the upeom-
ing elections for student body
president, vice-president and sec-
retary.

Larkin said he made the pro-
posal because it is fairest that
the people who are going to be
affected by an election are the
ones who vote. “The idea of
student government is self-gov-
ernment. Seniors neutralize the
voles of the people remaining,”
he said.

Jim Koch, a member of the
audience, argued that “seniors
know the system” and “seniors
set the people out to vote.”

Larkin replied that just be-
cause one has been here for 4

Employment news

Job hunting

By BOB CHIAVIELLO

As of late October there was
a 6.89 per cent unemployment
rate among 1976 graduates of
W&L, according to a report com-
piled by Mike Cappeto, director of
the placement office.

According to Cappeto, the un-
employment figure does not take
into account those people who are
not looking for jobs.

A more important problem fae-
ing the W&L graduate was under-
employment. Underemployment is
described as a job where the
grad’s degree was unnecessary for
the type of work he was doing.

Almost 40 per cent of the job-
holding graduates were laboring
among the ranks of the under-
employed. Cappeto could not offer
an explanation for the situation
other than that it was sympto-
matic of the nationwide employ-
ment problem.

When asked how W&L stood in
relation to liberal arts colleges
with similar academic standards
Cappeto said that the situation
was about the same.

He pointed out that one prob-
lem in comparing schools is that
no two schools report their data
in the same way. He added that
employers are not really interest-
ed in what college a man gradu-
ates from.

Cappeto urged that because of
today’s tight job market it is im-
portant for students to start look-
ing early, preferably in their
junior year. He said that the three
things an employer is looking for
are proven administrative, com-
municative and interpersonnel
ability, and the GPA is one of
the last things a perspective em-
ployer looks at.

Cappeto also added that em-
ployers are not all thyt interested
in what a students major was, but
would be impressed with work
experience.

Cappeto urged all interested
students to make an appointment
with him to talk — — -_—

lans and possibly lay groun
ail for the future. The Office of
Career Counseling and Placement
is on the first floor of the Stu-
dent Center,

VEC services

To help young Virginians
searching for a job, the Virginia
Employment Commission will
again publish “College Profiles, ’
a list of recent college graduates
which is distributed to many Vir-
ginia employers.

To be issued in March, April
and May, the list will carry the
student’s name, home address, col-
lege attended and major and
minor courses of study. Employ-
ers who are interested in a par-
ticular student may contact him
directly or arrange an interview
through a local VEC office.

Seniors or recent graduates who
want to be included on the list
should see their college place-
ment officer or visit their local
VEC office to pick up “College
Profiles” registration forms.

These forms, which have been
revised since last year, must be
completed, signed and returned
to the VEC. No charge is made to
applicants or employers for this
or any other VEC service.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 10, 1977

Seniors keep right to vote
in “Big Three” elections

years “doesn’t necessarily mean
you know more about the system
or the people in the system.”

Trip Wornom, another member
of the audience, wondered
whether senior class _ interests
were really any different than the
rest of the student body’s. Rick
Goddard, a law school E.C. mem-
ber, picked up on the theme.
He asked whether there had been
a history at Washington and Lee
of senior class interests being so
radically different from the other
classes’ that they would conspire
to back a senior class candidate.
When no one answered he said,
“if the system works, why change
ne”

After further discussion, God-
dard moved that the E.C. take no
action on Larkin’s proposal “un-
til such time as the results of a
referendum showing student
views on the subject are pre-
sented to this committee.”

Larkin noted that a vote for
Goddard’s motion would be a
vote against the E.C. itself sub-
mitting a referendum before the
student body. Any referendum
would have to come from a stu-
dent-initiated petition which re-
quires at least 150 signatures.

Goddard said, “The issue does
not seem important. It hasn’t gen-
erated any cries of disenfranchise
seniors.” He was referring to the
lack of vocal support for Larkin’s
proposal and to the presence of
only about 20 people in the audi-
ence.

In other action the E.C. voted
unanimously to send flowers to
Mrs. Betty Jean Mohler, a sec-
retary who helped type up the
transcripts of the private honor
trial held recently. The tran-
scripts were never used as ihe
student decided to withdraw
rather than have a public honor
trial.

W&L debaters

By NED McDONNELL

The English accents rang out.
The two debaters from Edinburgh
University used a skillful combi-
nation of humor and hard facts
to disintegrate the argument put
forth by their two Washington and
Lee opponents, Walt Kelly and
John Rosen. Jeremy Hayes, a
philosophy major from London,
and Allan Drummond, a lawyer on
a grant at Edinburgh, successfully
persuaded the audience that
America should have a democracy
and not the W&L proposal of a
changing corporate oligarchy.

The debate centered around the
question: Should America have
a government as good as its
people? The W&L duo unsuccess-
fully tried proposing that the U.S.
should have an oligarchy con-
sisting of three or four corporate
presidents to be elected annually
by the presidents of the top five
hundred corporations in Fortune
Magazine, with civil liberties en-
sured by the Supreme Court.

The surprise strategy didn’t
work. The two Englishmen, evi
dently unphased by the rationale
of Kelly and Rosen, used facts,
quotations, and ethnic and _ po-
litical jokes to solidly rebut the
arguments of the W&L pair.

Kelly and Rosen reasoned that
if a government is to be as good
as its people, it ought to be
equivalent to them. Therefore,
they argued that Americans
should have an efficient and
profitable government which
scrupulously guards their civil
liberties. They rationalized that
Americans do not deserve a de-
mocracy given their low electoral
turnout.

Hayes closed the debate by
driving home the realization that
the oligarchy proposed by his
W&L counterparts would be ir
revocable, that democracy, while
not perfect, is the best form of
government, and that an oligarchy
would breed unstable and violen!
politics.

Details for the next debate, such
as place, time, subject, ete. have
not yet been arranged.

Mime troupe teaching

By DOUG DEWING

Three members of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera Mime Company
are teaching drama at Washing
ton and Lee this term

The Mime Company, which
toured the United States last year,
performed at W&L in October
Its form of mime is different from
that popularized by Marcel
Marceau. The Warsaw group's is
» combination of ballet, dance,
music and pantomine

Lee Kahn, assistant fine arts
professor and director of the Uni
versity Theatre, said this form of
mime is a type of body language
in which the actor uses his body

athletically to tell the story and
to build his character.”

“It's a first cousin to ballet,”
he said

The three will teach students
the use of various theatrical styles
and will direct them in applying
those styles.

The course, dramatic styles in
practice, is an advanced acting
class.

Complaints explored

By HALE DELAVAN

On Jan. 19, 1977 some twenty
members of the Student Associa
tion for Black Unity came to Dean
of Students Lewis John’s office
to complain about the recent
Honor Trial of Junior Raynard
Scott. The previous night they also
decided to bring up other griev
ances that, according to SABU
president Mike Brooks, had been
pending since 1971. They were
referred to President R. E. R
Huntley and remained in his office
until 8 pm. While there, they
presented two major complaints
which they had concerning the
University’s attitude towards
them. The complaints were: 1) the
lack of black faculty 2) the lack
of reerultment co-ordination

The Ringtum Phi researched
these complaints and went to the
\dministration to find out what
it had to say. In answer to the
first issue coneerning the lack of

black faculty, Huntley said that
the University has made “sincere
efforts to make jt clear to po
tential applicant) for faculty posi
tons that black candidates would
be welcome. The University ha
talked with applicants and has

ade offers of facully positions to
blac! md it continues to do so

lluntley added that thus for there

were three major reasons for the
failure to attract black professors
The first is that there is a large
demand for such persons around
the country. The second is that
the number of blacks that are
qualified is small and that the de
mand is high. He elaborated on
this point saying that the services
and the abilities of such people
are being sought by non-educy
tional institutions to a greater dk
gree than are the services o!
whites, Therefore, many blacks
leave their teaching positions, A)!
in all, “The supply is low, and the
demand is high.” He also felt that
Washington and Lee would be jn
a better position to attract black
faculty once it has some. “The
fact that there are none make;
it dificult to get any.”, Huntle:
said

The second that SABI
p-esented was the question con
cerning the lack of recruitmen
co-ordination. Assistant Dean o
\dmissions Kenneth Ruscio stated
tat the University has made a
tremendous effort to encourage
jacks to apply, Curtis Hubbard

high hools in search of po
tential applicants, The Admissions

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, February 10, 1977

Answers

This may go down in Ring-tum Phi history as the “all-
letters” issue, even though there are only two of them. Both
are long, and both represent extended and thoughtful con-
sideration of the issues dealt with in this column, This is the
kind of response I've been looking for all year. I'm sorry that
it took an ugly and unfortunate incident to get this sort ol
reaction, Read the letters before this column.

In reply to Mr. Cantler: Honor is not the only issue, It
never is, Of tantamount importance are the principles of
liberty. It is entrely possible that a student be both guilty
of an honor violation and, at the same time, the victim of
improper or unfair treatment. Neither guilt nor innocence
has any effect on his right to a fair trial. The cries of “Pro-
cedure!” and “Discrimination!” came from individuals who
care about preserving the rights of a free man, rights which
are at least as deserving of our “jealous protection” as your
precious honor,

To Mr. Rose (with apologies for not being able to print
your entire letter): While the quality of the television pro-
duction of Roots is questionable, the importance of the book
at least is probably great, and it indeed could have been used
as a springboard for a discussion of racial issues.

Washington and Lee has always seemed exceptional to
me in the extremism of its attitudes and characteristics. In
terms of race relations, the University appears as extremely
white, extremely traditional, extremly conservative, and e€x-
tremely Southern (in terms of shared beliefs, not geography ).
Integration came to W&L extremely late. Blacks form an
extreme minority. The barriers which separate blacks and
whites seem somehow more formidable here than elsewhere,
at least among students.

If these barriers are indeed more formidable, then they
require greater effort to be overcome, Dialogues between black
and white students, whether formal or informal, must be
the result of mutual effort. The need for interaction and
intercommunication between white and black students is
desperate ; the will to achieve these goals must be strong.

And speaking of extremes...

Violence

_., the psychological pressure upon students at WAL, must
he immense. Why else would a group of mostly conservative,
upper middle class young gentlemen turn into a pack of de-
structive lunatics every weekend?

Violence at W&L is nothing new. Why, we beat up 4
bunch of Wahoos with sticks every Spring. | myself have
seen, during the course of a supposedly festive oceasion, a)
unsuspecting student suddenly hurled to the floor, where two
or three others proceed to jump on top of him, Perhaps none
of this seeems very serious.

Yet I have heard several recent reports of incidents which
appear to point up another kind of violence. These involve
malicious dstruction of private property and even assault,

Why these incidents of violence in a peaceful acadeniic
1 where such great value is attached to personal
> Is the academic routine so de-

community
integrity and responsibility
manding that all emotions must be bottled up during the work
week, only to be released in a wild rush on Friday and Satit!
day? Are we able to behave like “civilized” men most of the
time only by reverting to animal form over the weekend?
There is a fundamental imbalance,

At the very least one must be prepared to assume full legal
responsibility for any destruction of property or injury to
have caused, More helpful still

would be a thorough examination of the motives
such acts.

Letters To The Editor...

Right for the

Dear Sir:

There are, in this world, few
things I find more annoying than
to hear someone take a position
with which I wholeheartedly con-
cur, and then defend it for the
very worst reasons. I am afraid
that such has been the case in
last week’s editorial.

That the dispensation of honor
trials be delegated to an autonom-
ous body for which such matters
should be the sole concern, I
would be the last to take issue.
The present structure of student
government here provides more
than enough for E.C. members to
do. In fact, I think it most likely
that many might find consider-
able relief in not having their al-
ready cluttered days and nights
encumbered by the Burdens of
honor trials.

But, both you, Mr. Editor, and

the Student Association for Black

Unity, have missed the point, and
you have missed the point in a
manner signal of the decline and
fall of the honor system at this
university. To read page thirteen
of the present catalogue, one must
surely conclude that Camelot
lives, and the university regularly
enrolls almost seventeen hundred
Knights of the Round Table. We
are none of us so foolish (I hope)
as to imagine that such a thing
is true. Possessions simply are not
always right where he forgo!
them, and the word of a W&L
student is not always respected,
even within the institution. The
honor system is not what it was,
even Camelot fades, but undeni-
ably, we at Washington and Lee
enjoy a measure of trust and free-
dom not available in the vast ma-
jority of this nation’s places of
higher education. The fact that
anyone may wander through the
stacks of the library, that the
Co-op is not equipped with para-
bolic anti-shoplifting mirrors, and
that we actually may schedule our
exams at our convenience, are
rights well worth some thought,
and some jealous protection.

I say jealous protection, because
unless the students, not admini-
stration, faculty, or staff. or even
the risen spirit of General Lee,
are having a constant and ongoing
love affair with honor, this sys-
tem must surely fail. You, Mr.
Editor, and you, members of
S.A.B.U, but not you alone, are
in love, not with honor, but the
trappings of a penal system that
has nothing to do with honor.

Any society makes a choice as
regards honor; will it, or will it
not tolerate the presence of the

wrong reason

dishonorable in its midst. At
Washington and Lee, the choice
not to was made some time ago,
and it is known as the absolute
penalty. Anything less, any gradu-
ated penalty, any second chance,
is tantamount to an admission that
we will tolerate a lack of honor.
The rules of the E.C. as regards
an honor trial exists then with
one, and quite properly only one,
purpose, to determine whether or
not the individual on trial had
made a decision to conduct him-
self with out honor. Any other
concern with procedure, rules,
and regulations, is not only ir-
relevent, but patently dangerous
to the survial of honor here. The
answer is an honor trial is not
always clear or easy, but the ques-
tion is eternal and simple, and
it must be the only question for
the system to work.

It would be a mistake to think
that 1 am an apologist for the
E.c. 1 have as little use for
mosi of its members as | have for
our thirty-seventh U.S. President,
and convincing me of their tend-
ency to bend their own rules to
suiih their purposes would be
ease itself. Again, however, the
only question here is whether or
not a student has committed an
honor violation. If a student is of
the opinion that irregular means
were used to convict him of some-
thing he knows he did not do,
he has the option of public appeal,
where irregularitiesm ay be sub-
jected to the scrutiny of all his
peers. But if a student is guilty,
that is, all there is to it, and he
should and must leave.

I have heard no one protest
Raynard Scott's innocence. I can-
not pass judgement, I do not have
the evidence. If he has done
nothing, let this come to light, and
I will do everything in my power
to support him, for the dismissal
of an innocent man is less toler-
able to me than no honor system
at all. If the E.C. has conducted
itself without honor, perhaps the
parties aware of this should initi-
ate honor proceedings against
these offenders. But, if Mr. Scott
has done what was less than hon-
orable, let us not ery “Procedure!”
or “Diserimination!” Let us live
here, Mr. Editor, members of
$.A.B.U., and all others pleased
to call themselves Washington and
Lee students, for the truth, not
for the channels created to find
it. and sometimes perverted to
hide it.

Respectfully,
Win. D. Cantler "77

 

Ariel in need
Sir:

As Editor of the 1976-77 Ariel,
I think it is time to bring at
tention to a small problem that
is presently hindering the speedy
and efficient production of this
year’s literaray mgazine: lack of
interest. But | am not yet ready
to accuse the student body of
apathy—perhaps the problem is
timidity, in which case | have
some words for the potential, yet
hesitant, contributor.

First of all, try not to be awed
by what you may consider a
haughty and elitist publication.
The Ariel is an equal opportunity
magazine, which means that all
submitted works will be judged
with impartiality (English majors
get no special treatment), And
rest assured, | am speaking not
only for myself, but for the rest
of the staff as well.

in addition, | ask all of you
io consider the exciting prospect
of being a contributor to the
Ariel, and having your name ap-
pear for all the University to see.
Few things in life can equal the
thrill of seeing one’s name in
print, and thereby being vaulted
into the spotlight of distinction
among one’s peers. Did you miss
seeing your name on the Honor
Roll/Dean’s List posted outside
Payne Hall? If so, then here's your
chance to join an even more
eminent group. Before I continue,
let me emphasize one point: the
Ariel, despite this grass roots
appeal for contributions, will not
compromise its principles in order
to fill pages. As | mentioned
earlier, this magazine recognizes
no hierarchy among contributors;
however, the submitted materia!
itself will certainly be judged
with a justly eritical eye.

Finally, let me remind all fresh
men that they have a reputation
to live up to. The Ringtum Phi

reported, a couple of weeks ago,
that the members of the class of
1980 consider themselves better
than average artists and writers.
i am overjoyed to hear it. With
over 400 freshmen at W&L I
should be swamped with artwork,
photographs, short stories, and
poetry. Lam not. But there is still
time, and I am currenily braced
for a flood of contributions which
will enable me to compile a
representative collection of this
school’s creativity.

Respectfully yours,

Ryland Owen, ‘78

Editor, Ariel

Executive incompetence
Sir:

Would the mistakes made on
the part of the Executive Com-
mittee during the recent honor
hearing have occurred if a white
student had been involved?

This is a hard question to an-
swer and probably will never be.
However, several points should be
made. The “White Book” states,
“The accused student must be in-
formed of his status with a brief
description of the offense involved
at least three hours before the
hearing is to begin.

If, as had been suggested by the
defendant, this right of the ae
eused was not met, what would
have been the proper remedy’
Certainly, double jeopardy was
not!

The errors were those of the
Executive Committee and should
have been dealt with in a just
manner. Since recent events prove
that the E.C. is fallible. there
should be explicit avenues for re
dress of such errors and they
should not include double jeop
ardy.

Another matter that must be
confronted (whether or aot the
rights of the accused had heen

Interoffice memo to the editor-
in-chief from the managing editor:

You spoke too soon in your
weekly epistle from Sinai, or
wherever it is you sit to pen
your editorial madness. Wednes-
day morning I manged to find two
more letters in the usual places
that we find these things. Since
one of them fit into the theme
of the week, 1 went ahead and
passed it to the linotype, which is
even now sputtering and com-
plaining as it immortalizes the
golden words in lead. The alchemy
of print is wonderful, is it not?
Maybe you should write an edi-
torial about it as soon as you finish
the one on apathy at the football
games.

The second letter does not, re-
evettably, deal with race or honor
trials. It gets harder every week
to sustain an issue around here.

But I’m sure we have some sort of
obligation to our brothers in the
other fields of printed endeavor.
Maybe the letter could lead to
yet a second apathy editorial.

One last note. I figured out why
people throw couches through
windows and commit like atroci-
ties. I found out when I ran out
of copy paper late one Tuesday
night while working on_ this.
esteemed publication. On that oe-
casion I attempted to throw a
typewriter out a third-story win-
dow in Reid Hall. Unfortunately
it was bolted to a steel desk.
Those people don’t act like that
beause they are drunk and ir-
responsible. Look closely enough
and you may find that a majority

‘Roots’ and rotation

Dear sir:

_..1 do not know exactly what
“the SABU complaints against the
university” are, but that a certain
degree of racism exists on campus
seems unquestionable. As a fresh-
man last fall, I watched SABU
protest from my dorm window
and my fellow freshmen make
such comments as “get the white
sheets.” Comments of the same
nature—but not quite the same
tone—have been heard more re-
cently. All of this seems a bit
ironical in view of the public
reaction to the publication of and
television presentation of Alex
Haley's book, Roots. Both serve to
give the nation’s white population
a better understanding of the
black experience in America,
though the book succeeds in this
better than the television pro-
duction.

Each night “Roots” was pre-
sented on television, the TV room
in the student center was a bit
more crowded. The book and the
television production may leave
an impact on members of the
W&L community, as it will on
people across the nation, but it
seems that the impact at W&L
eould have been greater. More
then once I have wondered how
members of the black community
felt as they watched or read
Roots, and I was a bit surprised
that no one—either black or
white—tried to organize some in-
formal discussions about Roots.
In view of the recent problems
here, such discussion could have
proved beneficial. Organized by a
aualified person (a faculty mem-
ber, for example, or a group such
as SABU), the discussion could
have brought the experience of
Roots from a cultural or social
level to a personal one, and could
have eventually come around to
a discussion of the standing of
blacks at W&L. Such discussions
could provide a better understand.
ing between the black and white
communities, and could be quite
beneficial for SABU in particular.
Working through the student body
in such a way could lead to a
stronger voice and perhaps quick-
er changes, and certainly more
lasting changes.

... The proposal to create a
separate body to deal with honor
violations is an interesting one

and has great merit, but there
are two things about it that are
disturbing. One is the matter of
secrecy and the other concerns
the way in which the proposed
system is set up.

A few people I have talked to
seem to feel that the honor sys-
tem at W&L is at the hands of
fraternities. How widespread this
feeling is | am not certain, but
at times this seems to have merit.
I have heard of one ease in the
past where a student was found
guilty in a trial before the E.C.
and requested a public trial. At-
tempts were made to dissuade
him from asking for a public trial
and certain E.C. tactics hampered
his attempts to formulate his de-
fense. Yet he was acquitted in
the public trial but found the
atmosphere such that he could not
complete his education at W&L.
Thus it seems essential that one
address the problem of keeping
power out of the hands of a few
powerful groups in order to pro-
tect minority rights as one pro-
poses a new system. Also it brings
into question the merits of the
secrecy surrounding honor trials.

I do not think the “rotating
membership” proposal in the last
Ring-tum Phi is a good one. It does
not address the questions raised
above, and it seems to open the
system to more problems of the
type present in the Raynard Scott
case. Where students serve just
once, personal prejudices are
likely to come to the forefront
more often. Such a system would
have less responsibility than the
present one.

A better suggestion may be—
using the analogy to the U.S.—
treating each fraternity and the
indepentents as separate states
and allowing each fraternity and
the independents representation
on the court proportional to their
sive in the student body, with
a two-thirds vote needed to con-
viet. The representative would be
elected by their constituents, with
the understanding that any honor
trial of a court member be a
public trial. This, too, has its
problems. But the idea of separat-
ing the E.C. from honor trials is
a good one, and | hope that it is
pursued further.

Sincerely,
Ken Rose

Rugby team
gets ready

Although their cute little shorts
may not be much in evidence
in the following weeks, members
of W&L’s Rugby Club are pre-
paring to take to the practice
fie'd to tune up for their spring
season. The Ring-tum Phi recently
talked to the club’s coach, Jeff
Muck, about the club’s prospects
~-he was optimistic.

The major cause for optimism
is the appearance, from various
sources, of new talent. The fresh-
man ¢lass has supplied Chip Sisk
and Duncan Lowe, both of whom
have played aggressively and well
in forward positions, as well as
Al Fernandez, who showed po-
tential in the high-pressure full-
hack spot during the short fall
season. The law school contributes
its share of newcomers with Bill
Seidel, who brings impressive
credentials with four years of ex-
perience from West Virginia
Weslevan, and Bob Basco, who,
while his field ability is as yet
untried, has distinguished him-
self in traditional post-game
pursuits.

But the best of the club’s new
members come from Lexington.
Holding down fly-half will be Phil
Clayton, who brings nine years
of experience to that position.
Clayton will tour New Zealand
this summer with his home club,
San Francisco RFC. A second Lex-
ingtonian, Rick Norris, has six
years of playing to his credit.

Fluck anticipates few personnel
changes in the scrum, that group
of players who mob the ball and
its unlucky carrier in order to
regain possession of the ball. Re-
turning serum veterans include
Chris Johnson, Warren Wolfe,
ieorge Triplett, Tony Cuicci, Paul
Harris, Chuck Alt, and Dave
Hemenway, as well as Sisk and
Lowe. The unit has the potential
to be a powerful serum, but its
line-out expertise is suspect due
to a lack of tall jumpers.

The pivotal positions of crum-
half and fly-half will probably go
to Sal Abbruzzese and Phil Clay-
ton. Abbruzzese, while not the
flashiest kicker or quickest scrum-
half in Virginia union, is a strong,
steady player who specializes in
wearing down his opposite num-
ber.

A large number of players are
qualified to fill the remaining
back positions. Norris, David
Hamra, Bob Basco, and Jim Bar-
nett are likely choices for the
heavy contact positions of inside
and outside centres. A number of
good players are also available
for the wing three-quarter and
fullback slots: Bev Mauck, Bill
Frear, Ed Johnson, Angelo San-
telli, Al Fernandez, Bill Seidel,
Tommy Turner, and Rock Joyner.

LETTERS TO THE EOLTOR

(Continued on page 2)
violated) is the resultant leakage
in this case. The “White Book”
declares, “if the suspected stu-
dent faces the charges, is found
guilty, and withdraws from the
University without requesting a
Student Body Hearing, his record
shall only state that he with drew
from the University.... All such
information is considered highly
confidential.”

Here again, the Executive Com-
mittee seems to be in direct viola-
tion of the “White Book.”

The only conclusion that may
be drawn is that if these “mis
haps” would have occurred with
a white student, then the E.C. was
not bigoted, just incompetent.

I-M competition:
bowling, ping pong

By MICKEY KNAPP

As the varsity wrestling and
basketball teams continue their
successful seasons, the Intramural
program rolls on behind the
scenes. Bowling is in its regular
season phase, and ping pong is
now entering playoff competition.
This year’s wrestling program,
under a new tournament format,
will be held next week.

I-M bowling, which is played
each Tuesday afternoon at the
Lexington bowling alley, is being
dominated once again by Zeta
Beta Tau. Lead by Rick Lovegrove,
ZBT is undefeated to date and
should complete its regular sea-
son with a perfect record. Defend-
ing champions Phi Kappa Psi,
featuring last year’s MVP Chuck
Clow, have also been tough so far
with the exception of a rather
resounding loss to powerful ZBT.
Regular season competition will
continue through the month of
February with the playoffs to
begin in March.

Lambda Chi Alpha appears to
be the team to beat in I-M ping
pong. They have been champions
for two years running, and would
very much like to make it three.
Jim Lawson and Dave Davis are
the stars of this year’s squad. One
team does appear to have a chance
of knocking off Lambda Chi. Pi
Kappa Alpha, which retains its
overall lead in the total point
standings, is lead by Jim Fisher.
PIKA also completed its regular
season undefeated, and could very
well defeat Lambda Chi in the
playoffs.

under an entirely new format this
year. In previous years, the sea-
son had consisted of dual meet
competition concluded by a play-
off system similar to that of the
other sports. This year, however,
the program is to be conducted
under a tournament format on
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday of
next week. The competition is
sure to be intense, particularly in
view of the new I-M rule that al-
lows former lettermen to com-
pete.

With five sports completed,
PiKA maintains a strong lead in
the overall point race for the
1-M championship trophy. Sigma
Chi is second, Phi Psi third, and
the Phi Delts fourth.

Generals back in swim

The W&L swimming Generals,
now 52 and idle since a 67-46
setback at the hands of William
and Mary on January 29th, will
take the pool again this Friday
when they host Virginia Com-
monwealth beginning at 7:00 p.m.

W&L had a scheduled meet
with Morris Harvey College of
Chraleston, W.Va. last Saturday,
but the meet was postponed due
to the energy crisis. With the
concellation of that meet, all of
W&L’s 1976-77 dual meets are
now against NCAA Division I or
I! opponents.

The meet with VCU is the Gen-
erals next to the last2 home
meet of the season. They host
Old Dominion University on
Saturday the 19th.

three more games

According to the latest NCAA
release, the Generals are now the
nation’s 11th ranked Division JU
hasketball team, and that was
prior to this last week’s action,
where W&L claimed three vic-
tories.

In addition to national recogni-
tion in the poll, W&L’s winning
margin of 15.4 ppg is in the top
five, as is the team’s free throw
percentage of .764, and their won-
loss percentage of .895. That won-
loss percentage could be the best
Division Ul mark in the nation
when the next release comes out.

The teams’ three latest vic-
tories upped the Generals record
to 17-2, the best start ever for a
W&L hoop team, and-brought the
count-down to the “Magie 20” to
three games. If W&L can win
three of their next seven games,
ine “7677 Gens would become
only the third team in the history
of W&L basketball to win 20.
Should the team win four or more
of those seven games, the team
would find themselves alone in
the W&L record book as the
winningest team in the school’s
71-year basketball history.

Head Coach Verne Canfield,
now in his 13th season in Lex-
ington needs only three more wins
to give him 200 coilegiate career
coaching victories. Canfield is by
far and away the winningest coach
in the University’s history.

The three wins last week were
over Eastern Mennonite in Har-
risonburg 96-83, and at home over

Shenandoah 112-77, and Virginia
Wesleyan 109-77. The Generals
have now scored over 199 points
three times this season, and are
averaging 88 ppg.

Sophomore guard Mike Wenke,
already the school record holder
for most assists in one game (11),
surpassed Doug Clelan’s (71-72)
seasonal mark of 122 with 29
assists in the three wins. Wenke,
with seven games remaining this
season, now has 133 assists, an
average of seven a game.

Junior guard Pat Dennis upped
his team leading scoring average
to 20.6 with games of 23, 18, and
26. Senior center Don Berlin
added a career high 21 points
against EMC, and pushed his re-
bounding average to 8.2 a game.

It’s a two game week for the
Generals, as they host in-state
rival Randolph-Macon College on
Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. The Di-
vision IT Yellowjackets received
honorable mention in the latest
Diy. II poll and should provide
W&L with their most formidable
opposition thus far. Macon is 13-4
overall, and currently leads the
series 14-11.

Saturday the Generals travel to
Maryville, Tennessee to play the
Seo.s, the first of three con-
secutive road games for W&L. The
team is not home again until the
ODAC Tournament on February
226th. Incidentally, the win
over EMC assured W&L of no
worse than a first place tie in the
conference. They can wrap it up
by defeating Bridgewater on the
read on February 19th.

second place;

“finest performance” of year

Coach Gary Franke called it,
“The team’s finest performance all
season.” In what would have to be
termed their most successful out-
ing of 1976-77, the General grap-
plers finished in second place in
the nine team Pembroke State
Brave Invitational last Saturday.
Host Pembroke (N.C.) took top
honors with 154% points followed
by W&L with 112 3/4 and Camp-
bell College with 88 3/4.

W&L’s only individual champ-
ion was 142 lb. Ray Cross, a fresh-
man from Nazareth, Pa. In going
3-0 on the day, Gross won three
decisions by a total of 22-6. Nine
of the ten W&L representatives
placed in the tournament. Second
place finishers included Ed Rogers
at 150, Captains Jim Crytzer at
158, Todd Wohler at 167, and
Tom Oxendine at 177.

Boyd Breeding took third at 118,
Dan Kniffen finished fourth in the
heavyweight calss, and Howdy
Knipp (126) and Bill Cole (190)
finished fifth. Crytzer, a senior
from Mt. Vernon, Va., needs only
one more individual victory to
become W&L’s all time leading
match winner.

Earlier in the week, the grap-
plers bested V.C.U. 36-12 to run
their dual match record to 7-3.
The Cenerals remain in first place
at 3-0 in the ODAC.

W&L has two dual matches
scheduled this weekend, Friday
against Catawba in Salisbury,
N.C. and Saturday at Davidson
College. If the grapplers can win
both macthes, they would assure
themselves of their best overall
record since 1972-73.

Little sisters thriving at ZBT

The ABC store in Lexington,
according to the common wisdom,
has more volume sales than any
other store in the state. But an
equal record is undoubtedly set
by the University Supply Store’s
sales of Playboy, Penthouse, and
the like. The monosexual en-
vironment of Washington and Lee
is distrubing to many and annoy-
ing to most, but yes, Virginia,
there is an island of sanity in this
sea of frustration. At the Zeta
Beta Tau house, the Sisters Pro-
vram with Southern Seminary
College has been nothing less
than a stunning success.

The Sisters Program began in
‘areh 1976, with a proposal to

exand the female population at
the ZBT house. (The national
organization has approved of and
encouraged Sisters Programs for
years.) The first rush party was
held at the end of March, and
by Spring Term, the Sisters Pro-
gram was thriving.

The Sisters have their own
separate organization, with an

elected president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer, and social
chairperson. The present officers
are President Delene Holloway,
Vice-President Lee Ann Vazquez,
Seertary-Trasurer Debbie Wirtes,
nd Social Chairperson Kitten
Bond.

rhe Sisters are initiated into the
fraternity along with the brothers.
They pay social dues of $35 per
year, and plan their own social
ealendar. Their activities for this
school year have included fund-
raising, a slave auction, a sca-
venger hunt, a pledge raid on
VMI, a Christmas party, and a
planned camping trip for the en-
tire house.

An important difference be-
tween ZBT and the other houses
is that the Sisters are co-equals
with the brothers. Above all, they
are net the traditional submissive
species so common to W&L. They
have their own room at the house,

and can—and often do—bring
their own dates to al! social
affairs.

Many Sisters report that the
program has aroused a great deal
of interest at Southern Sem, and
also a good deal of resentment.
As one Sister said, “Now that all
the excitement’s worn off for the
freshmen, they sit around most of
the time with nothing to do.
The Sisters are the only ones with
a place to go, with something
to do al Ithe time.” The President
of Southern Sem, Dr. Kanipe, has
even given official written sane-
tion to the program, in response
to a pledge scavenger hunt re-
quest.

For many of the Sisters, the
program eliminates the artificial
and superficial relations that are
caused by a monosexual environ-
ment similar to W&L’s. “We're
no longer treated like cattle;
there’s no massive round-ups for
dates like at other houses. We're
treated as genuine persons in our

own right — something that’s
rarely found anywhere else,” re-
ported a new member. Most

and SABU never sees or hears of

William McHenry was asked by

that. He replied that the Athletic

co-ordinate recruiting efforts of
black students with black athletes
on campus. He said he had a list
of black students that have been
contacted. Copies of that list were
