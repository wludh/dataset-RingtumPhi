An Election...

Somewhere around 4 a.m.
Wednesday, the nation got its
latest President. There may have
been some joy over the fact in
some parts of town, but at W&L
the majority were probably not
extremely happy. Some people are
celebrating Carter’s win and
others are showing signs of deep
despair. Most of the people are
somewhere in between: a quick
informal pall of selected per-

E.C. reviews elections;

subcommittees report

By ROBERT CHIAVIELLO

In a quiet session the Executive
Committee heard reports from the
various E.C. sub-committees and
discussed voting regulations for
future elections.

Paul Larkin, senior E.C. rep,
brought up for discussion the
question of disenfranchising sen-
ior undergraduates and third year
law students from the big three
elections. Last week the E.C.
voted to prohibit third year law
students from voting for the E.C,
law representative. No action was
taken.

Dave Cranshaw made a motion
to reorganize the Student Control
Committee. He proposed that the
president and vice president of
the Student Association, who now
serve on the SCC, be replaced
with the three law class presi-
dents. The motion passed unanim-
ously.

In further business the E.C,
heard a report from the Student
Activities Board. Co-chairmen
Mike Armstrong and John Berley
reported that Homecoming was all
set to go and that Fancy Dress was
taking form. They also reported
that the Film committee had been
doing better than expected and
that there were no definite plans
for the Winter concert yet.

The Curriculum committee re-
ported that it was in the process
of gathering information on a pre-
calculus course, and also trying
to gain faculty support since they
fecl such a course is needed. They
also said that a survey of courses
by the students will be taken the
week of February 13.

Finally the E.C. voted not to
submit the petition to change the
exam schedule because of a lack
of support. Only 550 people signed
the petition.

sons—any that would come near
the reporter—showed that most
of the people on the hill this
morning (Wed.) are either happy
with the fact, or resigned to it.
The heavy emotion came last
night.

The heavy opinion came down
on the absentee ballots that have
been floating through the Post
Office in the past couple of weeks.
The strong feelings also showed
on last week’s RtP straw poll.

eS

“Great!!! We got a choice be-
tween corporate fascism and a
welfare state.”

Now I'll admit that the guy who
said that is a serious alcoholic
with homicidal tendencies. Ill al-
so acknowledge that this is the
time of the decade when we
should be burying hostilities and
pretending to love whoever won
for at least two weeks. But when
1 heard that comment from a
student looking over his absentee
ballot, I knew I would wind up
using it somewhere. So there it
is: a comment on choice in an
article about W&L’s choice.

And considering that every-
one has printed or broadcast these
poll results by now except us, I
can't think of a better way to
begin this article. Now that I
do have it off to such a roaring
start, the best fact worth start-
ing with seems to be that the
faculty cast 24 votes for Jimmy
Carter and 1 for Lester Maddox.
Not bad. The faculty vote saves
a lot of time for the writer—there
is absolutely nothing to say about
it. The vote says it all.

Notes &¥@ Events

Exhibit
ibi

Scale models of 22 of Leonardo
da Vinci's most important draw-
ings will be on display in duPont
Gallery for two weeks beginning
Monday, Nov. 8.

The models include both practi
cal and theoretical devices.
Among them are a paddle-wheel
ship, an idea not successfully de
veloped until the advent of steam
power in the 19th century; a
theoretical gear system that pro-
duced three speeds, as in the mod-
ern automobile transmission; and
a device for determining the
tensile strength of wrie, informa
tion essential to the engineer of
five centuries ago and today.

Other models include da Vinci's
flying ship, a helicopter, a Ma
chine gun, a printing press and a
two-level bridge.

The models are on a tour under
the sponsorship of IBM, which ac
quired them in 1951. They are dis
played with panels of explanatory
material and sketches reproduced
from da Vinci's notebooks.

The gallery will be open daily
from 9 a.m. through 4 p.m.

Calyx

Phe final make-up day for Calyx
underelass formal portraits is to-

Chapel at 6 p.m

Prof. Tsai-ping Liang is re
carded as the foremost performer
med composer for the cheng, an
instrument similar to the zither

consisting of 16 strings stretched
over 16 frets on an oblong wooden
box. Silk strings were orginally
used on the cheng, but brass
strings have been common since
about 1500,

Born in northern China in 1911,
Liang is a graduate of Peiping
University. He moved to Taiwan
in 1959. He has given concerts in
countries all over the world, from
southeast Asia to Europe.

His program will consist of
traditional Chinese music and
music of Liang’s own composi-
tion. He has written more than
40 songs for the cheng and his
book “Music of Cheng’ is in its
fifth edition.

tertainment

Scholarships

Two W&L students have been
selected to receive the Lewis Kerr
Johnson Commerce Scholarship,
awarded annually by the School
of Commerce, Economics and
Politics.

The two are Jerry M. Baird of
Fort Warth, Tex., and Steven C.
Yevich of Richmond. Baird, a
junior, was selected for the first
time. Yevich, last year’s recipient,
had his scholarship renewed.

The Lewis Kerr Johnson Com-
merece Scholarship was created in
1974 in honor of Dr. Lewis K.
Johnson, professor of administra-
tion at W&L from 1933 and
former head of the department.

Lecture

“Access to the Media: Free-
Speech Rights in Conflict” will be
the topic of a lecture next week.

Dr. Franklyn S. Haiman, pro-
fessor of communication studies
and urban affairs at Northwestern
University, will speak in duPont
\uditorium Tuesday, Nov. 9, at
7:30 p.m

Articles by Halman on speech
and constitutional rights have
twice won awards from the
Speech Communication Associa-
tion. His article, “Speech vs. Pri
vary: Is There a Right not to be
Spoken to?” was cited by the
United States Supreme Court in
one of its decisions. He is also
the author of a number of books,
including “The Dynamics of Dis-

eussion” and “Freedom of
Speech.” He was editor of “To
I'yotect These Rights.” a six

volume series published this year

Haiman is the founder and
former chairman of the Speech
Communication Association's com
mission on freedom of speech and
was a member of the national
board of directors of the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union

His visit is sponsored by the
i'niversity Center In Virginia and
the W&L Enelish department

The student body went over-
whelmingly for Ford—65.4% of
the ballots. Carter took 25.2% of
the vote.

The interesting part of the poll
comes in the breakdown of votes
by class and school. Ford took
78.9% of the C-school, and 62%
among students in the College.

Among seniors the loser won
57.6%; juniors, 641%; sopho-
mores, 69.8%; and freshmen,
73.3%.

The class difference is a sub-
ject worthy of discussion that we
have neither the time nor the
space to print here. It could have
been parental influence, it could
have been the fact that the CRs
have more members in the frosh
and sophomore classes, or it may
have been, as one professor
theorized, that people really are
learning something here.

WLUR election coverage again
fastest, most accurate in area

The following article is ex-
cerpted from a full-length fea-
ture by Ring-tum Phi staff
writer Randy Smith. The editor
regrets that due to limitations
of space, the article could not
be printed in its entirety.

WLUR’s election night coverage
started at 5 o'clock Tuesday eve-
ning with a two-hour tape of
predictions state by state. Live
coverage of the election started
at 7:00 from Studio A anchored
by Seott Thomas, WLUR’s co-
ordinator of the entire project.

But the most important aspect
of the coverage, the reports on
the sixth district, was taking place
in Studio B, where Brad Elliott
was assembling information from
25 reporters “in the field” through-
out the district. WLUR prides it-
self on their coverage of the 6th
district election results, claiming
to be “eonsistently first in re-
porting sixth district returns.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, November 4, 1976

Politics

| find myself in the equivocal position of writing before the
national election an editorial which will appear after the whole
affair has been decided. Predictions, then, are of little value
(they probably are anyway); I don’t know yet to whom con-
gratulations and condolences are to be offered, Nor do I know
whether to maintain a positive hope for change or simply re-
sign myself to the status quo, that is, a continuation of the slow
deterioration of a nation.

The results of the presidential straw poll conducted by the
Ring-tum Phi contained few surprises. The largely conserva-
tive student body, led by the Commerce School, opted for Mr.
Ford by a substantial margin. The faculty, on the other hand,
voted overwhelmingly in support of Mr. Carter. As one pro-
fessor put it: “That's what happens when you get educated.”

The poll, it may be argued, was not truly representative of
University opinion, Yet the methodology was reasonably ob-
jective and the sampling taken, while limited, represents pro
portionately more of the University community than that of
most such polls, I believe that some valid conclusions may be
drawn.

On the basis of age alone, the results might seem at first
to be the reverse of normal expectations. Ford's appeal is large-
ly to financially established middle- and upper middle-class
professionals—the “Establishment” set, our parents, for ex-
ample. Carter (and Mondale) have appealed to groups gen-
erally associated with liberal or, leftist ideals, as per Mondale’s
voting record in the Senate and Carter's own iconoclastic phil-
osophies. The lowered voting age should, in theory, help Car-
ter’s cause. Yet here and elsewhere in Virginia (Longwood,
Randolph-Macon and other schools), Ford won decisively
among students, while academicians, unlike most other profes-
sionals. have been traditionally liberal on public issues, and at
least here have indicated strong pro-Carter support,

Without making qualitative judgments, | think it fair to
say that the student body at W&L is far from average when it
comes to political philosophy. Instead of being a typically re-
bellious, liberal, socially concerned group of young seekers, it
is a body of mannered, conservative, fiscally oriented future
leaders. There’s probably nothing inherently wrong with
that. I just wonder what is it I'm being left out of.

| did not vote. Until too late | remained apathetic, uncon-
cinved that my vote could make a difference and unconvinced
of the worth of either candidate. That I regret. But—win or
lose--I am not sorry to have given my “dying voice” to Mr.
Carter, and not sorry to be disassociated from the mainstream

of Washington and Lee political opinion,

Seigenthaler speaks out

by DAVID W. TALLEY, JR.

John Seigenthaler, publisher of
the Nashville Tennessean, was in-
terviewed on October 19, 1976.

RtP: Are you advocating unlim-
ited freedom of the press?

S: Yes, that’s what I think the
first amendment of the Constuit-
tion is about. When the founding
fathers said Congress should pass
no law abridging freedom of the
press, they meant that.

RtP: The problem is that the
press has a tendency to sensation-
alize and saturate the public. Is
the purpose for this to sell pap-
ers?

S: Not really, but that is a com-
mon public misunderstanding
about the press. For example, I
would say that there is no crime
that’s been committed in my com-
munity since I’ve been a reporter
that ever sold enough newspapers
to make it worth overplaying or
sensationalizing. There are still a
few cities, like New York and
Chicago, where headlines may sell
tabloid newspapers. In most cities
in America, habit, not headlines,
sells newspapers.

I reject the concept that head-
lines sell news. The truth is that
the press just sometimes makes
mistakes; this is nothing new. The
founding fathers envisioned that
the press would make mistakes,
but even while there would be
harm from the mistakes, the
greater harm was to give some
agency of government control
over the press.

RtP: I would think that there
needs to be some type of control,
perhaps self-imposed, to keep
things from getting out of hand;
such as the saturation by the me-
dia of things like hijacking and
assassination attempts.

$: There is a lusty, activist, poli-
tical press in this country. I think
the press is fairer, more objective,
more reasoanble today. Reporters
are more informed, aware, and
balanced. Even so, the potential
for harm is there. The potential
for greater harm is in giving any
government agency the right to
cut off that lusty press. When you
suggest self-imposed restraint, |
support that. I believe that it is
really demonstrating simple fair-
ness and equity to those about
whom things are said. There is an
obligation te do that, not accord-
ing to law, but morally and ethic-
ally.

RtP: Do you, as publisher, de-
cide the self-restraints on your
paper?

S: We have standards which
have evolved over a long period
of time that I continually review
with the staff, and I take respon-
sibility for those standards.

RIP: How does your paper de
cide which side of an issue or
which candidate it is going to sup-
port?

S$: We have an editorial board
which meets with me every morn-
ing, and we discuss the news of
the day and try to develop a con
sensus. We also have certain
guidelines which are set out in
the will of the man who bought
the paper in 1937, and whose fam-
ily stil owns it, having to do with
the newspaper's identity and edi
torial policy. He wanted it to be
progressive, by his standards, so
we have that tradition to follow

RtP: In the area of confidentia-
lity of sources, how is the reader
supposed to simply accept that a
“high-placed” or “unimpeachable”
source is really reliable”

S: it is a difficult problem, and
I think that responsible people
lean away from the practice of it
when they can, when a story re
lies on unnamed sources, I recom-
mend that people read the story
with skepticism.

RIP: From your

speech last

night, I gathered that your stand
is that the sixth amendment
ment should remain, but not in
such a way that it infringes on the
first amendment.

S: That’s exactly what I think.
In a few cases, the Supreme Court
has said that pre-trial publicity
may be inherently prejudicial. I
don’t accept that thesis; I believe
there are ways to get fair trials
even when there is publicity about
the case. But, because of those
few cases, judges around the coun-
try are imposing “gag rules” and
sending reporters to jail. My posi-
tion is that the only option is to
stop sending reporters to jail. It
cures nothing. It doesn’t stop him
from publishing his story, and his
paper more often than not goes on
to back him up. My theory is that
if the constitutional right of a free
trial is inhibited by pre-trial pub-
licity being inherently prejudicial,
and I believe it is not, then the
answer is to free the accused. I
think the effect of that is going to
make the press much more re-
sponsible.

Tm not calling for wholesale
dismissal of cases because report-
ers write about trials. I'm saying
that I don’t think that reporters
writing about trials necessarily
prejudices a jury in a community,
or if it does, that can be cured
without the contempt power being
exercised. In those cases, it would
be better for the courts to not vio-
late the first amendment, but to
protect the defendant's right to a
fair trial and dismiss the case
against him as they did in the

Generals make W&XL history

by J. MICHAEL GALLAGHER

From the opening kickoff, W&L
looked on the verge of running
away with the game. Though this
never happened, the Generals did
play well enough to capture their
third win of the season.

Bridgewater won the toss and
elected to receive. They fumbled
the kickoff and W&L gained pos-
session of the ball within 30 yards
of the goal. The offense could
only move the ball to the 8 though,
and Dan Thompson booted a field
goal with 12:21 remaining in the
first quarter.

Though the offense received a
break early in the game, the de-
fense didn’t. They didn’t seem
mentally prepared for Bridgewat-
er (who were 0-6 going into the
game) in the first quarter as the
Eagles drove 70 yards down Jop-
son Field for a touchdown, and
leaving 6:50 on the clock.

The rest of the first half was

marked by good defense from
both teams. W&L’s defense gave
up little yardage while the offense
gained little. Our running attack
was slowed considerably as the
Eagles’ defense keyed on fresh-
man running back Stew Atkinson.
Quarterback Ted Hissey was able
to move the ball somewhat
though, through his passes, but it
only culminated in a missed field
goal from the 13 before time ran
out in the first half.

The second half saw a rejuv-
enated offense and defense come
out of the W&L locker room. W&L
returned the kickoff to their own
28 yard line and through the use
of a strong passing attack, short
yardage, runs, and_ well-timed
draw plays, the offense marched
72 yards down the field. Atkinson
plunged in for the score from the
one yard line, with 9:27 left in the
third quarter. It was evident that
the momentum of the defense had
also shifted as they held Bridge-
water to negative passing yardage
in the second half. Bridgewater
could not generate any offense
whatsoever, thanks to our defense.

W&L’s offense controlled the
ball for 20 minutes of the second
half, but even though our offense
had the ball most of the half, they
couldn’t find the handle to score.
We were inside their 10 yard line
twice in the second half and
couldn’t score a TD, and because
of Thompson’s hurt leg, we
couldn’t kick a field goal.

W&L did manage to score one
more time as Hissey again went to
work, completing a 40 yard pass
to Tony Perry and then an 8-yard
pass to Curis Walsh for the TD.
Fans then had a rare opportunity
to see Perry attempt the extra
point—and miss. The game ended
16-7.

Hissey ran the offense with his
superb passing as he completed 17
of 25 passes with 2 interceptions,
for 200 yards. Atkinson (though

still leading the backs) was held
to 2.3 yards per carry, but was in-
strumental in gaining tough yard-
age on key downs. Tony Perry had
his best game of the year as he
caught 6 passes for 75 yards, and
Rich Wiles also did a fine job re-
ceiving 4 passes for 40 yards.

But our hats should go off to
the defense who held the Eagles
to 142 yards total offense, 98 on
the ground and 44 in the air. The
defensive line was very strong
stopping in the running plays, and
putting constant pressure on the

passer. The defensive backs limit-
ed the effectiveness of Bridgewat-
er’s quarterback, when he manag-
ed to get the ball off. Carl Folcik
was named Defensive Player of
the Week, as he led the defense in
their fine showing.

For those interested in sport’s
trivia, this is the first time since
1972 that the football team has
won 3 games in one season and
the first time since Bill McHenry
took over the coaching job. It is
also the first time we have had
back-to-back wins since 1973.

Midshipmen defeat
Generals, 6-0

The upset of the year was not to
be, as the soccer Generals went
down to defeat at the hands of the
Naval Academy, 6-0, last Satur-
day. It was a close game at the
half in Annapolis, with the Mid-
dies holding a 2-0 lead. But W&L
once again fell prey to their lack
of offensive punch, being outshot
48 to five.

In addition to goalkeeper Mark
Bennett, who set two school rec-
ords in the game against division I
Navy, Coach Rolf Piranian singled
out striker Bill Stone, halfback Ed
Grandes del Mazo, and fullback
Jeff Barr for playing a strong
game. All three performers are
possible all-conference selections.
Stone continues to lead the Gen-
erals in scoring with five goals
and an assist for eleven points.
Grandes del Mazo is next with two
goals for four points.

junior from Neptune City, New
Jersey, is now W&lL’s all-time

leader in career saves. He was
credited with 28 against Navy,
giving him a total of 283 saves in
less than three full seasons. Paul
Devine had previously held the
record of 274 saves in four years.
Bennett has three games this year,
and all of next year to add to his
mark. The 28 saves is also a school
record for most saves in one
game, formerly held by Tom Mit-
chell, who made 25 saves in a 1967
game. Bennett is a sure bet to
break Mitchell’s seasonal mark of
150. With three contests remain-
ing, Bennett has 137 saves.

The Generals wrap-up their
1976 season this week. The boot-
ers play conference games at
Hampden-Sydney on Tuesday and
at Roanoke on Sunday. The final
home game of the year is Friday
at 3:00 p.m. against Virginia Tech.

The J.V. soccer Generals are
now 2-2-1 on the year after losing
to Eastern Mennonite 2-1, and de-
feating Dabney Lancaster C. C.
4-0.

And it was not until Wednesday
morning that I watched the ballot
box in full swing and realized
what the winning of a new Presi-
dent could mean. Now I know
what it feels like to see the pro-

a feeling of shock with the ma-
jority of W&L students.

they embrace being carried out.
The Republicans must get used
to disagreeing with a lot of what
happens in Washington. All of us
must accustom ourselves to a
massive change. All of us are see-
ing, for the first time in our lives,
a changing of the guard in D.C.,
a new regime to control and di-
rect our nation and our lives.

I, for one, was not ready for
it, even after reading several
papers and magazines for the last

year. I think I share that unreadi-
ness with most of the students
here. Even the Democrats on
campus are not sure exactly what
will happen after the inaugura-
tion. But after the strain of an
election night that went into the
hours even accounting majors
don’t keep as a regular thing, the
wait for January 29, 1977, the last
days of Jerry Ford and maybe the
Republican party should be easy
by comparison.
