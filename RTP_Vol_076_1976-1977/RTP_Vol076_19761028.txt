Have you ever wondered what
it would cost you if you got
caught kidnapping a freshman
from his dormitory room at W&L?

For the first two fraternities
caught kidnapping this year,

Delta Tau Delta and Phi Kappa
Sigma, the answer was $25 and
a warning. But Inter-Fraternity
Council President Alfred Robin-
son warned that any further viola-
tions by any fraternity will result
in a muen stiffer fine and some
kind of probation.

The two $25 fines for kidnapping
were among the almost $600 in
fines levied by the JFC during and
after rush this year. Only one
fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, emerg-
ed from rush without a_ fine,
according to Louis Hackerman,
the IFC Rush Chairman.

The two heaviest fines were
incurred by Sigma Chi for illegal
dorm rushing. They received a
$75 fine and a warning for the
first offense and a $100 fine and

conduct probation for the second
violation.

Members of Sigma Chi
house who are also dorm counsel-
ors were caught distributing notes
to freshmen in the dorms. The
notes thanked the freshmen for
attending an open house at Sigma
‘hi and asked them to return for
another visit. The result was a
$75 fine and a warning.

the

Later, another member of
Sigma Chi was caught in Lee

House during a period in which
fraternity members were not al-
lowed in the dorms. A $100 fine
and conduct probation ensued.

Hackerman described the first
Sigma Chi offense as “pretty
serious” and said the $75 fine and
warning was too lenient.

The IFC constitution says, “Sug-
gested penalties are: first offense,
$159 fine; second offense, $300
fine; third offense, suspension of
rushing.”

Alt Sigma Chi dorm counselors
were supposed to be distributing
the notes, according to Terry
Atwood, one of the dorm counsel-

S.A.B. request

By JIM PARKER

In a clash Monday night be-
tween the Executive Committee
and the Student Activities Board
the E.C. acceded to an SAB re-
quest.

In an 8 to 3 vote, all standing
committees were allowed to ap-
point their own freshman mem-
bers for this year. Prior to this
vote, the E.C. was in charge of
interviewing applicants for ap-
pointment to each committee.

The dilemma arose when the
SAB independently selected two
freshmen to sit on their commit-
tee and requested that no more
be added. Four other freshmen
applied, although only one ap-
peared before the EC Monday
night.

After some discussion by SAB
co-chairmen Mike Armstrong and
John Berley, a motion was offered
by EC President Tom Hunter to
allow all chairmen and cc-ohair-
men to interview applicants and

select new members.
Among the three dissenting
voters was newly elected fresh

man representative Jacobo Jnes

In other business, Vice-Presi
dent Sandy Stradtman reported
on the Faeully-EC meeting he
attended. At the meeting, a pro
a one-week winter break
poposal was passed to recommend

Saturday, Dec. 11 and end them
Friday, Dec. 17 was turned down
Exams will begin Dec. 13 and
end Dec, 18 as planned

Concerning the question ol Lee

this is not popular, then the patio
will be torn up and removed.

The Board of Trustees, which
controls the decision on renova-
tion, was persuaded somewhat by
the survey which determined that
a majority of students would
oppose work on the chapel.

It was noted by Tom Hunter
that parking next to the Woods
Creek Apartments was ruled eco-
nomically unfeasible by Univer
sity President Robert Huntley

Jim Underhill proposed a mo
tion by which third year law stu-
dents would vote for upperclass
law representatives, as is the case
now. This was rejected 6 to 5.

Another motion was put forth
by Paul Larkin to disenfranchise
the third vear law students. The
motion passed 6 to 5. Senior Law
Representative Dave Crenshaw
brought up the issue to clarify
the voting situation.

In other business, the EC voted
by acclamation to arrange for the
execution of former RtP news
editor, Joe Fitgerald. The issue
came up when Cold Check Com
mittee chairman Bob Couch asked
how one would go about closing
EC committee appointment hear
ings, an act forbidden by the Stu
dent Body Constitution,

An EC member said one would
have to either pass a constitu
tional amendment or hang Fitz

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 28, 1976

Rush violations exposed

ors who is a Sigma Chi. He added
that all seven of the Sigma Chi
dorm counselors probably were
not involved though.

The letters were hand-written
and hand-delivered, according to
Atwood. He said no one in Sigma
Chi really saw it as a violation
of the IFC rules.

Atwood said he thinks Sigma
Chi will appeal the ruling, but
added that the rush chairman
will have to make that decision.
“T still don’t see it as a rush
violation,” he said.

According to the IFC consti
tution, “No dormitory counselor
may engage in rushing activities
in the dormitories.”

Dean Lewis G. John said he
feels the fine was fair. He said
the Student Activities Committee
approved the fine, but added that
he thought the committee was
unaware of the suggested fines in
the IFC constitution.

The incident was investigated
and, according to Dean John, it is
felt that such violations were not
widespread among dorm counse
lors.

Robinson said that stiffer fines
than the one the Sigma Chi’s re
ceived are provided for, but
stressed that both the Judicial
Board and the SAC decided the
penalty was fair.

Fines for rush violations are set
by the Judicial Board. It consists
of the IFC president, vice-presi-
dent, secretary, treasurer and
rush chairman and a senior justice
and two junior justices. Their de-
cision is then reviewed by the
SAC.

In reference to the second
Sigma Chi violation, Terry At-

wood said he thought the indi-
vidual caught had just forgotten
that he was not supposed to be
in the dorms.

$300 of the remaining fines
were levied for returning fresh-
men late from rush events and
were spread fairly evenly among
the houses. Too many fraternity
members at rush tables in the
quad resulted in $30 in fines.

New gym ruled out
for Winter concert

By NEWS STAFF

The Student Activities Board
has dramatically reduced _ its
Winier concert plans after being
denied in its request to use the
new gym for the event.

The request went through the
dean of students office but was
turned down by the athletic de
partment.

The SAB requested the use of
the new gym because of its 3500
plus seating capeaity

The concert is planned for a
weekend with no conflicts at sur
rounding schools, so a large draw
and successful event would be ex
pected

The department's reason for the

denial was that the date the SAB

requested is the day before a
basketball game and the team
needs to practice under game

conditions. The old gym was ruled
out because the floor is not as
good and shooting from the corn-
ers is more difficult.

Head Basketball coach Verne
Canfield did say that he would
shorten practice so the SAB could
have the new gym by 5:30 in the
ifternoon. The SAB turned down
this consession, saying they would
need the gym by noon to set
up sound end lighting equipment

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Thursday, October 28, 1976

Good, Bad & Ugly

The Good: Last year we had guaranteed copy for the
editorial page whenever we found ourselves with a last minute

 

shortage. Someone would sit down and write an editorial
saying that the E.C. was all to hell. The writer was usually
right.

This week, however, we are forced to admit that the mem-
hers of our governing body have done something almost
commendable. They have trashed the rule that candidates for
office must turn in financial statements before the elections
or be stricken from the ballot.

(In the past the only debate that rule has caused was a

short war in the E.C. room over whether the correct word was

“struck” or “stricken. )

It was a fine rule. It kept the candidates honest by making

them pledge before the balloting that they had complied with
the regulations concerning campaign expenditures, There's
only one catch. Neither the spending limits nor the financial
stateménts are allowed by the constitution, a fact Paul Larkin
brought up in calling a special meeting for last Tuesday to
correct the inconsistency.

We applaud Mr. Larkin and his colleagues who voted to
repeat the election contested because of these problems. We
hope they stick to their adherence to the constitution. We will
be waiting if they don't.

The Bad: The old gym? But, seriously now, fellas, where
is the Winter concert going to be held?

We attribute rumor status to any outrageous stories that
a gym almost big enough for a respectable keg-party—well,
maybe a pony keg—is going to be used for a decent-sized
concert. The stories are merely some coach’s practical joke
they have to be.

There is a question of priorities here. Are athletics, specifi-
cally basketball, more important than student entertainment ?
Or, put another way, is the typical W&L man more interested
in being entertained or being athletic? Maybe that’s not the
exact issue at hand, but we are sure that the true one will be
chosen soon by the student body,

Considering that the only question last year explosive
enough to slice through the strata of student apathy was the
Great Lexington Spinners War of 1976, we have little doubt
that we will hear more of this alleged concert in the old gym.

The Uguly: Fraternity membership has its advantages
and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is that frat men
have to put up with the Khaki Khonspiracy to an even greater
extent than independents. These people have supposedly taken
over the LFC social positions and are working on reducing
the stigma of a rush violation. No longer will certain infrae-
tions be viewed as harassment and entrapment, They will be
considered henceforth simply as collegiate pranks.

Something smells when dorm counselors quit being sur-
rovate daddys and start playing recruiter, The odor is over-
whelming when they keep their jobs after being caught. \nd
when the penalty for the offending frat is less than the ma
mum after the second violation, a good fumigation is in order
We are beginning to wonder what is beng protected when
IC Judicial Board hearings are held behind closed doors,
\re they trying to salvage the offender's reputation or the
IC's?

Or are they trying to save everyone's friendships? —J.G.F.

The Law School

lhe removal of W&L's only full graduate division, the
hool of law, from Tucker to Lewis Hall has sharpened the
lines of definition between the graduate and undergraduate
schools. Logistics now dictate a -spatial and temporal division

between “them” and “us.” The law students not only have
their own separate facilities, but facilities which are in many
ways superior to the undergraduates’, at least from a tech
nological viewpoint, No more can we expect to see W&L’s only
full-time female students lounging about on the front lawn
(and just what did happen to those nice white chairs’); we
are no longer faced with semi-pro competition when litigat
inw over a place to sit in the Co-op, So just how are the two
divisions related ?

Recently, it was suggested that the law school should form

own Executive Committee for the purpose of hearing honor

Pinball wizardry rampant

By BILL THOMSON

They stand, sometimes for hours
on end, with backs curved for-
ward, fingers twitching, feet plant-
ed firmly on the carpeted floor,
hips swaying forward and from
side to side in desponse to the
movements of the machines they
caress, and eyes focused intently,
through intervening sheets of
plate glass, on erratic silver balls
that seem to move with wills of
their own. Occasionally — they
stomp their feet, shout and throw
harmless insults at each other.
Rows of spinging digits roll up
ever-changing scores, colored
lights flash over plastic and metal
landscapes, and the sounds of
bells and buzzers intermingle in
sporadic bursts.

“They” are students, and “they”
form a group that, although it can
not be termed a counterculture,
ean at least be classified as a
special interest group. Assembl-

ing several times a day en masse, _

usually in the fternoon and at
night, the amorphous group in-
tently plugs quarters into pin-

ball machines with the objectives
of beating the odds, scoring free
games and having fun.

Evidence indicates that mem-
bership in the group can become
expensive (this, of course, de-
pends on the individual). The ma-
chines, according to Marshall
Sumner, head manager of the
Cockpit and the adjoining game
room, take in an average total of
over $400 a week. A lot of
quarters.

The game room contains 11 pin-
ball machines, two foosball ma-
chines, five pool tables, one air
hockey table and one comput-
erized baseball game. These games
have spawned a somewhat pe-
culiar language which is unique to
W&L pinball aficionados,

“Nice gape!” (an unfortunate
mistake).

“You drained it!” (ball went
down middle or side exit),

“Double  bone-aiii!” (double
bonus).

“Triple bone-aiii!” (triple
bonus). :

bridge Concert-Theatre Series’
1976-77 season.

Morath will bring to Lexing

ton his purview of America dur-
ing the turn of the century in
his new one-man show, “The Rag
time Years,’ which blends music,
humor, history, and satire into a

bright and affectionate look at
another era,
Tickets for the entire RCTS

series may be purchased at the
door at this presentation. The
series price is $12 for adults, $8
for college students, and $3 for

sity on Jan. 17 in Lee Chpel; a
return engagement by the Hart

ton High Schoo! Auditorium; and
the Waverly Consort on March 15
in Jackson Memorial Hall

Morath’s show not only ex
plores ragtime piano music, but
offers songs by Bert Williams,
Irving Berlin, and other ragtime
ivricists, some famed and some

forgotten. Morath further sue

ceeds in bringing the period to
life with his humorous insights
into the history of the time

As an interpreter of the Ameri
can past, Max Morath first gained
national attention in the 1960's,
with twe award-winning series for
television dealing with the rag-
time era. In 1969, he launched in
New York the theatrical review,
‘Max Morath at the Turn of the
Century.” A national tour fol-
lowed, and critical acclaim was
unanimous. Walter Kerr of the
New York Times said: “Sheer de
luht! You'll find Max Morath a
deleetable companion.”

the-ball-hosed-again!” (this one is
self-explanatory, and must be
gasped in an exasperated, emo-
tion-choked voice).

Sumner said that the game
room, which opened with the stu-
dent center in 1969, began featur-
ing pinball machines in 1972 after
a number of student requests. The
popularity of the machines has re-
mained constant over the years,
in contrast with the fluctuating
popularity of the pool tables from
year to year, he said.

The machines, Sumner said, are
in the game room under contracts
with two Roanoke vending com-
panies, which divide control of
the machines about equally. The
approximate gross average of $400
a week is divided on a 50-50
basis between the vending com-
panies and the Cockpit. Some of
the pinball money from last year
returned to the game room in the
form of new carpeting, which was
installed this past summer.

Problems such as beer-drinking
in the game room, non-students
using the machines and break-ins

are “no! so much of a problem
now.” Sumner said. (‘Te said the
last break-in was two years ago).

In any ease, pinbdall is alive and
thriving at W&L.

In addition of several new ma-
chines in the game room this year,
a computerized hockey-type game
has been added to the Cockpit.
With a couple of old songs by
the Tams and the Showmen now
on the juke box, students can
play computerized hockey (which
bleeps every time someone scores)
and listen to oldies while eating
their sandwiches. Imagine the
scene as two students crouch over
the television-like sereen, mani-
pulating little levers and anxi-
ously following the trajectory of
the “ball” with their eyes. The
Showmen’s ‘'39-21-46” is playing
softly in the background.

Bleep. Bleep.

“You... With-your 39-21-46

A taste of the action: Varsity stickmen find out what it’s like to face the best in lacrosse as their former
teammates outmanuver them en route to a 15-10 victory. The score was neither surprising nor disappoint-
ing, however—the W&L alumni lacrosse team is about the best anyone will ever have to face.

Alum Stickmen defeat varsity

Dave Warfield, W&L class of
1975, brought back memories of
his playing days when he was a
second team All-American by scor-
ing four goals and assisting on
two others in leading the alumni
team over the varsity lacrosse
squad, 15-19. The rain-soaked ex-
hibition provided an opportunity
for the followers of W&L lacrosse
to see the individuals who will
represent the Generals this spring
in action, as well as seeing some
of the graduated All-Americans

who they had heard so much

about.

Ted Bauer, a former first team

Jack Dudley had a goal, while co-
captain Tom Keigler had an assist

Independents, football, tennis
highlight imtramural season

By MICKEY KNAPP

Intramural football, golf and
tennis have been in full swing at
WAL this fall. With fraternity,
independent and facully teams
competing, the action has been
exeiting and the competition has
been intense. The regular season
schedule has been completed in
colf and football and playoff
games are to begin this week,

A wrinkle has been added to
this yeu'’s race for the overall
Intramural points championship
and trophy with the addition of
the independent “Grandstanders. '
For the first time in many years
an independent team has formed
which will carry over from one
sport to the next. In previous
years independent teams have
been formed to compete in one
IM sport or another, but have

invariably split up at the end of
a particular season. But this year’s
Grandstanders, organized and led
by varsity wrestling captain Jim
Crytzer, will stay together as a
group throughout the year. They
believe that they have a solid shot
at the overall IM championship,
and their playoff berths in both
football and golf indicate that
they may very well give the tradi-
tionally powerful fraternity teams
a run for their money.

This year’s IM football field has
been dominated by three teams:
Pi Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma
and Phi Delta Theta. All three
were undefeated during the
regular season and all look to be
strong in the playoffs. Pika’s big
red machine rolled through its
schedule led by quarterback Jim
Fisher and linemen Jamie Vardell

and Bob Sundberg. The Phi Kapps,
going for their third stright IM
championship, once again have a
strong offense which revolves
around the passes of quarterback
Joe MeMahon to wide receiver
Ben Johns. Middle guard John
Gordon leads their defense. The
Vhi Delts have been surprisingly
strong this year. Wide receiver
Tom Pritchard may be the best
in the league at his position but
it is the team’s overall strength
which has been itsm ost im-
pressive feature.

This year’s tennis program has
been conducted under the capable
instruction of head official Jim
Houston. The top teams in this
year’s competition include Phi
Psi, Pika, SAE, Law, and the
faculty team. The faculty did not
participate in last year’s IM
tennis, but have come back with
a strong team this year. Last
week's player of the week Dr,
John Winfrey and undefeated Dr.
Thomas Vinson have been the
standouts of the league along with
Bill Keasler of Law. Due to the
large number of teams signed up
this year, and the many rainy fall
days which have forced cancella-
tions, the regular season has not
been completed and the playoffs
will not begin until the end of
next week,

Generals down Sewanee

On the strength of a rewarding
16-14 victory over the University
of the South last Saturday on
W&L’s Wilson Field, the football
Generals are now 1-0 in the sec-
ond half of the ’76 season. If the
team can win three of their re-
maining four games, the Generals
will finish the year with a 5-5
record. The 1967 W&L team finish-
ed at 5-4, and was the last foot-
ball squad to finish at .500 or
above. The Generals 2-4 overall,
have won two of their three home
games to date, but are still wait-
ing for their first road victory.

The team has their ione remain-
ing conference game on Saturday
as they travel to Bridgewater to
take on the winless Eagles.

ence, the rivalry will. be renewed
this weekend.

Head coach Bill McHenry called
the game against Sewanee “a
super defensive effort.” Continu-
ing, McHenry noted, “Our six
interceptions were the key to the
game. Sewanee threw the ball
forty-three times, but their six
turnovers proved fatal. Our de-
fensive unit performed admirably,
and the offense showed spark at
times. This win will not only serve
to booster our confidence, but it
also gives us momentum as we
prepare for our final four games.”

Sophomore cornerback Jack
Norberg intercepted three Tiger
passes, with Bryan Sibson, George
Ballantyne, and Bob Clements

field goal, followed by Stewart
Atkinson’s four yard TD run in
the second period. The 9-0 score
held until the South scored on a
pass from QB Ron Swymer to Joe
Shults with just over a minute
left to play in the half.

With a scoreless third quarter,
Atkinson again put the Generals
on the board with a one yard
plunge early in the final period,
Thompson kicking the PAT. After
recovering a W&L fumble, Se-

down with 1:32 remaining on a

enterprise and competition as
institutions which enable Ameri-
cans to prosper. Inflation and un-
employment won’t go away over-
night, but the suecess Gerald Ford
has had with bringing inflation
under control is astonishing—
even more so considering the

given him a realistic of view of
what is possible within govern-
ment and what is not. Camelot
and the Great Society serve as
empirical evidence that spending
and public programs per se are
not panaceas for economic ills.
The record shows just the op-
posite. The anti-Washington candi-
date proposes new programs, arti-

Congress. Ford’s experience has ‘*": ; _
= P ficially flavored with “reoragniza-

tions” while Ford takes a difficult
political stance, but one with
sound economic underprinnings.
He makes no promise, he just asks
that we look at the record.

Ford neither wants to, nor will
he, neglect unemployment. In the
last 17 months, four million new
jobs have been created, yet the
labor force has increased, so these
gains do not show up in the rate
of unemployment. Carter’s sup-
port of the Humphrey-Hawkins
bill invites disaster and repudi-
ates recent history.

America will always need a
strong defense, whether in times
of war or peace. Most presidents
have realized this and Ford is no
exception. Since coming to office
and throughout his legislative
career, he has always viewed this
as our number one priority. It

is so easy to decry defense spend-
ing: the fat general and the cor-
rupt Lockheed official have been
all too visible. A state governor
who does not perceie the stakes
of the international situation can
exploit these images. But no one
can argue that the country 1s at
peace, with no Americans fighting
or dying on foreign soil. The re-
spect other nations have for the
United States is in part due to
the honest leadership of Gerald
Ford.

spiralling inflation, an ever de-
creasing Gross National Product,
increasing costs of medical care,
housing, food, energy and educa-
tion as well as the deteriora-
tion of our cities, it is little
wonder that Americans are look-
ing for new leadership. The Ford
Administration has shown itself
to be little more than a classic
example of negative government,
exhibiting a lack of initiative in
solving the nation’s problems.
Rather than take steps to solve
problems such as unemployment
and inflation, the Ford Admini-
stration has vetoed nearly every
piece of Congressional legislation
designed to remedy the troubled
economy.

It should not surprise anyone
that the present “media blitz” be-
ing conducted on behalf of the
President has not made any ref-
erence to significant accomplish-
ments by Ford. Rather, it has
mainly consisted of disparaging
remarks directed at Jimmy
Carter’s record as governor of
Georgia. The reason: Gerald Ford
simply has not accomplished any-
thing notable since he has been
president.

On November 2, the American
masses will be given the opportun-
ity to choose their next quadren-
nial leader. If the electorate wants
a government which is in effective,
and insensitive to the economic
needs of this country as well as
a government which is ineective,
incompetent, and bureaucratically
wasteful, then Gerald Ford will
be given an electroral mandate on
Tuesday. On the other hand, if
the American people wish to have
a government characterized by

fiscal responsibility, efficiency,
openness and honesty as well as
a government committed to solv-
ing the problems with our eco-
nomy, cutting bureaucratic waste,
ridding the government of secrecy
and allowing for a more open
foreign policy, then Jimmy Carter
will be elected President.

The choice seems to be very
clear—-government based on in-
action and non-initiative, or a
government determined to restore
faith through action and _pro-
ductivity. Therefore, as the fami-
liar campaign slogan muses, “For
America’s Third Century, Why
Not Our Best?”
