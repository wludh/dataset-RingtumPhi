Panhel
plans for
housing

By Courtney Payne
Staff Reporter

The women in Washington and
Lee's sororities want houses compa-
rable to renovated fraternity houses,
according to the results of a Parihel-
lenic housing needs survey.

Wendy Wilson, Panhellenic
Housing and Extension Committee
Chairwoman, said she met last
Wednesday to share the survey re-
sultsiwith Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins,
Assistant to the President Frank Par-
sons and Dean of Housing Ken
Ruscio.

Of the 112 women surveyed,
95 percent said they_ would like so-
rority houses that would provide
living and meal facilities as well as
meeting space.

The second most popular idea,
listed on the survey as an immediate
need, was for permanent meeting
facilities. The third choice was for
lodges, which would be used for
storage and meetings but not living.

Wilson said the list was divided
into three sets of needs: immediate,
interim and long term. It included
all suggestions put forth to the com-
mittee from the three sorority chap-
ters on campus, she said.

“We're not sending a proposal
to the university right now, we’re
sending the things we need,” said
Wilson. “It's a first step so that
Panhellenic and the university can

1 cooperatively deﬁne the housing
possibilities for women’s frater-
. nities."

“We’re waiting on the university
right now. We’re in a holding pat-
tern until they come back to us,”
said Wilson.

Beard: weekend
was ‘pretty good’

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

Although the Lexington police
issued two noise violations and nu-
merous noise warnings to many of
Washington and Lee’s 16 fraterni-
ties, Police Chief Bruce Beard was
pleased with students’ conduct dur-
ing Halloween parties this weekend.

“I feel pretty good about the
weekend," ,Beard said. “I was glad
to see it, since it was also W&L’s
Parents’ Weekend." '

Beard said the two houses which
received noise violations were Sig-
ma Chi and Pi Kappa Phi. Because
they received noise violations, both
houses will not be issued noise per-
mits for one week.

Both fraternities were also given
one week of social probation by the
Iriterfratemity Council.

Main library
to close
on Sunday

From Staff Reports

The University Library will
be closed from 7 a.m. Sunday to
7 a.m. Monday for electrical
maintenance.

According to Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent Jim Ar-
thur, power to the library must
be turned off Sunday so that
_crews can work on the build-
ing’s transformer.

“We have tried to schedule
this to cause as few problems as
possible,” Arthur said.

University Librarian Barbara
Brown encouraged students to
use the library on Saturday
instead.

According to Beard, only two
people were arrested for underage
possession of alcohol this weekend.

“I think the new law [under
which a person convicted of under-
age possession can, under extreme
circumstances, temporarily lose his
driver's license] is making people
think twice about being out on the
street with beer,” Beard said.

At Tuesday night's IFC meeting,
IFC President Kevin Nash warned
the fraternities about controlling
noise at parties, as well as the regu-
lation requiring fraternities to regis-
ter all parties with the Dean of Stu-
dents office, even those held in the
country.

“You can’t forget to register
your Wednesday night parties,” said
Nash. “You can’t just blow it off.”

Nash also again reminded the
fraternities that all mandatory pledge
activities are prohibited until the

Job fair draws 600

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Over 600 students from nine
area colleges participated in
“Challenge," a career fair held last
Friday in the Student Activities Pa-
vilion and sponsored by the W&L
Career Development and Placement
office.

There were 126 recruiters repre-
senting 63 companies on hand to
meet with the seniors, give out in-
formation about their companies and
conduct pre-selection interviews.

This was the seventh annual ca-
reer fair organized by a consortium
of schools including Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Longwood, Lynchburg,
Mary Baldwin, Raldolph-Macon
Woman’s College, Sweet Briar, Vir-
ginia Military Institute, as well as
W&L.

In past years, the fair had been
held at the Raddison hotel in
Lynchburg, but W&L agreed to host
the event this year.

According to W&L Recruitment
Coordinator Penny Henneman, the
purpose of Challenge was to provide
a forum for seniors to get informa-
tion about companies in which they
are interested.

The fair was very successful,
according to Henneman, and will
most likely be held again, next year.

Following the morning session,
which included several workshops,
each company conducted interviews
with students whose resumes had
been reviewed.

“There was a very good range
of companies represented, from the
highly technical ones to the more
general types of companies, and
they were all interested in liberal
arts students,” said Henneman.

More tickets
on the way

Lex hires additional officer;
enforcement begins Dec. 1

By Joel Smith
Staff Reporter

When Washington and Lee stu-
dents return to school in January
following Christmas break, they will
find stricter enforcement of parking
laws in downtown Lexington, Mayor
H.E. “Buddy" Derrick said Tues-
day.

Derrick said the city has hired
an additional policeman who will
devote half of his time enforcing
parking laws and the other half
serving as Lexington’s animal con-
trol officer.

The stricter enforcement of the
two—hour parking limit downtown
will actually begin Dec. 1, but the
city will issue courtesy Christmas
citations instead of actual tickets in
order to ease into the new approach.

Beginning Jan. 1, however, vio-
lators will have to pay the usual
$10 fine, Derrick said.

Construction of the Wal-Mart sh-
opping center beside Rt. 11 North
and the upcoming construction of a
larger K-Mart store at the other end

of town created a need to open up
downtown parking spaces, the may-
or said.

According to Derrick, stricter,
more regular parking enforcement
will increase the availability of
two-hour parking spaces downtown
and help downtown merchants com-
pete against the two retail stores.

“The city is concerned that the
downtown area continue to be a vi-
brant area for business and the ser-
vice industries, and a major compo-
nent of that is viable parking,” Der-

rick said. “We want to have conve-
nient parking for our downtown
shoppers.

“Due to a shortage of man-
power, we had been enforcing it on
a hit-or-miss basis, but with the iri-
creased competition of the two sh-
opping centers we feel the urgency
for having convenient parking'down—
town,” he said.

The increased parking enforce-
ment will affect not only W&L stu-
dents but also shoppers, store own-
ers and others who work downtown,

Peppers’ condition
‘much improved’

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

The condition of Washington and
Lee Commerce School Dean Larry
Peppers is “much improved"
following a heart attack Thursday,
according to Pepper's secretary.

“The word we’ve gotten is that
he’s_ been steadily improving over
the last wee ,” saids Anne Zeigler,
who added that Peppers is expected
home “probably this weekend.”

Following his heart attack, Pep-
pers was admitted to Lexington’s
Stonewall Jackson Hospital. He was
transferred to Roanoke’s Memorial

Hospital Friday.

According to‘ university Vice
President John Elrod, Peppers
should be able to return to teaching
“fairly soon.”

“We have every reason to be-
lieve that he will make a complete
recovery, and that he will be able to
return to all the activities he was
engaged in before the heart attack,”
Elrod said.

Peppers came to W&L in 1986
from Creighton University in Oma-
ha, Nebraska. He recieved his doc-
torate degree from Vanderbilt Urii—
versity.

Peppers’ son, Todd, is a W&L
senior.

Phi to list check bouncers

 

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

Students who have failed to ap-
pear before the Student Financial
Relations Committee to answer
questions about bounced checks will
now see their names advertised in
The Ring-tum Phi.

The Executive Committee decid-
ed to take that step after hearing
from James Rambeau, Chairman of
the SFRC, at Monday's EC meeting.
Rambeau said that there are present-

ly seven students with outstanding
debts and that it has been difficult

getting students to appear at SFRC
meetings.

In the past, the SFRC secretary
has called students with debts and
then mailed letters telling them
when to appear before the SFRC,
Rambeau said.

Rambeau suggested that if the
students do not appear after getting

seniors

Scott Jackson, a W&L senior
who attended Challenge said, “It
was better than other career fairs
I've been to because there was an
opportunity for interviews in the
afternoon. There were a lot of com-

panies that do not do regular
recruiting at W&L represented
there. ’ ’

Jackson's only complaint was that
the bulk of the companies that at-
tended seemed to be commercial
banks.

“There needs to be a wider range
of firms to interview other majors.
It seemed to be mostly for C-School
majors,” he said.

Also, according to Henneman,

the students looked very impressive.

“They were all dressed as they
should have been for job interviews
and, on the whole, looked very pro-
fessional,” she said.

a letter then the following week
their names should appear in the
Phi. The EC voted unanimously to
institute this procedure.

“We’re not trying to penalize
students,” said EC President Willard
Dumas. “We just want them to re-
pay their debts to the student
body.” The SFRC pays the amount
of any student check returned to a
local merchant for insufficient funds.

‘In other business, Dumas pres-
ented two proposals which would
give W&L students a fall break.

The first would give students a
week off halfway through Fall Term
but only Thanksgiving Day off in
November.

The second proposal would give
students Monday and Friday off at
the six-week mark. At Thanks-
giving, students would have
Wednesday through Friday off but
would have classes on Saturday,

The EC voted to hold a referen-
dum to gauge student interest

Also, the EC sub-comrnittee re-
sponsible for proposing penalties for
unauthorized charges’ by student or-
ganizations made its report. The EC
decided any student who makes un-
authorized charges will be person-
ally liable for what he spends and
will also be fired.

“Once we make people person-
ally liable, they will think twice
about charging,” Dumas said.

The EC eliminated the charging
privileges of the Student Activities
Board earlier this year, after the
SAB spent $23,000 over its budget
last year. Virtually all of those over-
runs went toward the 1989 Fancy
Dress Ball.

At present, a no-charging rule
applies only to the SAB, but a sub-

committee of the EC is exploring
the possibility of applying that ban
to all EC-funded organizations.

The EC also heard budget

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phl, November 2, 1989

Wilson studies
the Self—Study

It’s getting so a newspaper can’t ﬁnd anything to rant
about nowadays. Just when we were getting a mild furor
started, the Washington and Lee Board of Trustees and
President John Wilson have to go and do something
right.

Last week in this column, we complained about
something called the Washington and Lee University
Long Range Plan, also known as the Self-Study. We
called this 440-page document a “monstrosity.” We said
it was “devoid of fiscal realism and student input.” We
blasted its calls for tying tuition to the costs of other
schools and questioned the study’s motives.

Now, we ﬁnd out that Wilson and W&L’s trustees
have gone and eliminated the reasons for much of our
concern. Although the board has yet to take ofﬁcial
action, Wilson tells us that he and the board’s Executive
Committee have already pegged some of the study’s
recommendations as too expensive, unnecessary or just
plain wrong.

Speciﬁcally, according to Wilson, the study’s idea of
basing W&L’s tuition on the rates charged by “compara-
ble” institutions is all but doomed. The president on
Monday predicted that the present means of setting
tuition, which is based on the cost of running W&L and
has nothing to do with other schools, will be preserved.
We applaud the president for taking that position.

The study also suggested W&L should work to admit
equal numbers of men and women. Here again, the
trustees and the president said no. While nothing is set
in stone, a letter from Wilson to the board’s EC and
another letter from the board’s EC to the rest of the
trustees indicate that, over the next ten years, W&L will
strive for a student body of 1,600, with 1,000 men and
600 women. The board’s EC seems here to have found
an appropriate balance between what it called an
“erosion of alumni support” that would result from “a
perception that we have departed substantially from our
heritage” and the need for W&L to avoid being simply
a men’s college that admits women.

The EC’s letter also urged caution on another point -
plans for a new student center. 'l‘he trustees acknowl-
edged the need for a new Co-op and Bookstore, and they
joined the president and the authors of the Self-Study in
calling for a new building in which fraternity and
sorority members, independent students and faculty
members may gather. But the trustees seem well aware
that building another Fairfax Lounge or Arlington
Women’s Center would be a ridiculous waste of money.
Even though the Self-Study’s authors, the president and

the trustees agree that a new student center is i’m"por‘tan"t, ’ '

the EC’s letter makes a point of urging “careful further
study of the particular functions and spaces intended for
the new building to insure that our intentions will be
fully realized.” Translation: one Fairfax is more than
enough; let’s not build another.

We were pleased that the trustees raised an important
issue the study did not: the need of W&L’s sororities for
meeting and social space. The sororities have indicated
an interest in building lodges or houses, and the
university should be supportive of that effort. And the
reduced need for on-campus facilities that would result
from their construction should be considered in planning
a new student center. Furthermore, in all areas of student
life, the fact that sororities may make some proposed or
existing university services redundant should heavily
inﬂuence plans for the rest of this century.

'Clearly the board and the president are on the right
track. We still question some aspects of the study that
the board’s EC did not — for example, we doubt W&L
really needs a full-time chaplain, we question whether
“class unity” is as lacking and as crucial as the study’s
authors and the president indicate, and we have serious
problems with spending tuition dollars for residence life
programs that most W&L students neither want nor need.
But, in general, we believe Wilson and the board’s EC
have properly balanced faculty idealism and leadership
with a sense of ﬁscal responsibility and a recognition of
student competence and independence. We like the
sifting we have seen so far; we are optimistic that it will
continue.

‘Super 301’ will be a super mistake}

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

The United States may soon .«

suffer from Congress‘ newest venmre
into protectionism known as “Super
301," a measure provided for under
the Omnibus Trade and
Competitiveness Act. Earlier this
year, under the "Super 301"
premise, the United States targeted
Japan, Brazil and India as “unfair
traders" that could be subject to
tough retaliation if trade negotiations
do not prove satisfactory in reducing
these countries’ barriers.

If the United States does resort to
protectionist measures, the other
countries will surely respond with
their own retaliation against US.
exports, thereby destroying American
jobs and risking a U.S. recession.

Retaliation has proved costly in
the past. For example, when the
United States set tariffs on Canadian
cedar in 1986, Canada responded
with restrictions on American
computers and grains. When the
United States placed resnictions on
$50 million worth of Chinese textiles

in 1983, China cancelled American
wheat contracts worth $699 million.
In these two cases, the
shortsightedness of U.S. cedar and
textile exporters destroyed American
jobs in other innocent industries.

In addition to destroying jobs,
protectionism forces consumers to
pay higher prices. According to
Georgetown University economist
Gary Hufbauer, in 1986 trade barriers
cost Americans $65 billion, or an
average of $1,080 for every family
of four. More speciﬁcally, Brookings
Institute economist Robert Crandall

lock American workers into positions
that will only exist as long as
politicians in Washington want to
protect them. '

Why then, does protectionism
remain a popular choice in
Washington? Many U.S. industries
have found foreign companies to be
stiff competition. So, these industries
have decided to compete politically
rather than economically. They have
spent huge amounts of money on
lobbying in Washington in the hope
of shielding themselves from foreign

. competition.
estimates that Japanese “voluntary" Many of these industries have
“P011 Yestmims 0'1 m°t0T Vehicles undergone difficult adjustments

added an average of about $2,500 to
the price of 1987 Japanese vehicles
and about $750 to American models.

Some critics of free trade argue
that protectionism saves jobs in the
industries it protects by sheltering the
industries from foreign competition.
But, jobs saved by protection don't
always equal other jobs lost.
Recently, proposed textile legislation
was promoted as saving 46,700
textile industry jobs, but it was later
revealed that the legislation cost
52,400 jobs in the retail industry.
That's a net loss of 7,700. In such
cases, the jobs that are saved simply

during the past years, and many of
them still have more adjustments to
make. But during the 1980s
recession, America as a whole chose
not to travel the route of economic
isolationism paved with protectionist
legislation. In the true American
spirit, we met this challenge through
the often difficult task of
restructuring, retooling and rebuilding
American industry.

One example close to home is the
automobile industry. Although the
rebuilding is not over, the industry
has already made encouraging gains.
Ford's sales went up 16 percent from

1987 to 1988, and General Motor’s,
and Chrysler's went up 8.3 percent
and 21.2 percent, respectively. Herel
increased international competitio
has stimulated improvements and
innovation in production processesr
and industry structure. If the
government had interfered, it may‘
have condemned the Big Three to lag;
behind foreign
indeﬁnitly.

If Washington wants to build a,
stronger America, it should move to
eliminate protection already in place)’
For example, the U.S.-Canada Free
Trade Agreement promises to be a
boon to both countries. They
agreement is expected to increase
U.S. GNP by $45 billion and’
Canada's GNP by as much as $15,
billion.

The U.S.—Canada Free Trade‘
Agreement is a good example of the;
kind of “get tough" trade policy the
United States should pursue. Instead!
of leveling the playing ﬁeld by ‘
copying other countries’ unwise
protection, we should negotiate with?
other countries to reduce their),
harmful barriers. This is the kind of
policy that won't cost American jobs;
or hurt consumers and will build a ,
strong America.

PHA explains
housing status

In response to last week’s editorial, I
believe- it is necessary to clarify the
Washington and Lee Panhelleriic Association's
current status in regards to housing. An excerpt
from Chairman Wendy Wilson's Panhellenic
Housing Committee Report of Oct. 17 follows:

The Panhellenic Housing Committee met on
several occasions this year to assess the current
housing/meeting room situation. The committee
evaluated the present circumstances and
established a two-part goal. The first part of
the goal dealt with deﬁning future housing
plans for the association based on what ideas
and desires the Greek women expressed. In
addition, a cooperative list of all the known
present meeting space options was planned so
that the resources could be compiled and
shared throughout the association.

The chairman has also met informally with
Dean Leroy Atkins, Mr. Frank Parsons, and
Dean Ken Ruscio to discuss suggestionsittfri
the university. A survey was also sent to each
Greek woman, asking her to rank a list of
needs, not options, according to their
importance to her. The results of this survey
were compiled and presented to Parihellenic
Council on Oct. 17, and to university ofﬁcials
on Oct, 18. Currently the committee is waiting
for questions and ideas from the university.

To date these are the only steps that have
been taken. I say this not to discount their
importance, but to note the misleading nature
of the editorial which states: “sororities, the
prime users of Fairfax Lounge, seem well on
their way to building lodges of their
own...[and] that the use of these places
[Arlington Women's Center, Fairfax Lounge,
and any additional spaces to be built] will end
as soon as lodges go up.” The editorial then
concludes that “we would be hard—pressed to
ﬁnd two more under-used facilities on campus;
now the study says we need a third." The
reasoning is faulty primarily because of the
assumption that lodges will go up. The
Association is examining all housing options,
and lodges are only one option. Also there are
other university organizations that rely heavily
on the existing facilities for meeting space and
perhaps could beneﬁt from additional space.
That, however, is not the issue I am
addressing.

Until more information has been gathered
from the Greek women and the university, no

 

LETTERS

deﬁnitive statement or assumption can or
should be made in -temis of housing.
Unfortunately when a statement is printed that
implies that lodges are likely to be built, a
conclusion has been drawn prematurely, and
the idea is planted in the reader's mind as
being fact or work under progress. I must also
add that a reporter from the Phi meets with
either the Publicity Chairman or myself on a
weekly basis. Correct information and the
status of any committee work is available at
this time. Thank you for your attention to this
matter, and I would appreciate you making this
clariﬁcation available to the readers of the Phi.

Sincerely,

Buy bleachers
for away fans

Whatever happened to the time when a
football team and its fans would take up one
side of the ﬁeld, while its opponents and fans
would occupy the other? It was always that
way in high school, and it is always that way
when our football team travels to away games.
Unfortunately, that's not the way it is here at
W&L.

We desperately need to install bleachers for
fans on the visitor's side of the ﬁeld. I've
watched our opponents’ supporters for four
years come in and take over the ﬁfty yard line
at every home game. It is incredibly
disheartening as a player to hear, what sounds
like, the entire stadium erupt into cheering
when our opponents score. At home games, I
want to hear people cheering for W&L! That's
the whole point of the “home ﬁeld
advantage.” Last year, we even had to deal
with the Randolph-Macon College cheerleaders
right behind our bench doing cheers throughout
the game.

It is ridiculous that a school as well off as
Washington and Lee carmot supply a small set
of bleachers for the visiting team’s supporters.
Every other school that I've ever seen has such
stands, and I can't ﬁnd any logical reason why
we don't. I hope that our new athletic director,
Mr. Michael Walsh, noticed this problem at
Saturday's game. I also hope he will consider
doing something about it.

Sincerely,
Chris Smytlie, '90

I was photographing the game and was in -i

Coach Fallon approach Craig and say to him
“Now when we get the ball back I want you ‘r
to...” I was inﬁnitely impressed to see that
Coach Fallon was not going to accept defeat,
until he had given the team's best effort to t
achieve victory, and that included the on—sides
kick he was sure the Generals would recover. "
He was so conﬁdent, in fact, that he was t,
preparing his wide receiver and the rest of the
offense for another shot at pulling out a win. N
Seconds later, when Bridgewater recovered the

Coach Fallon still exempliﬁed the image of a 1

telling them they had nothing to be ashamed of '

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron
Humphries

A few weeks ago I had the plea-
sure of traveling to the West Coast
to visit some friends. It became nec-
essary for them to leave me for a
few hours, and they suggested I see
the convention of the American
Atheists Society only a few blocks
from my hotel.

People packed the hotel lobby of
the convention, while outside ven-
dors were selling souvenirs. I
managed to work my way into the
main floor of the convention just
minutes before the lights went dark,
and the speaker stepped to the podi-
urn. The person standing next to me
said that no one had heard much
about the speaker, except that he

,' An estimated 300 children at-
tended the fifth annual Halloween
-Haunted House hosted by the Wash-
ington and Lee University chapter
of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

‘i There was no charge to walk
through the haunted house, but do-
irations were collected for The
Mnited Way.

Despite the large turnout of local
Ehildren however, only $25 in dona-
tions were collected, said Todd
Pearce, vice president of Lambda
Chi. Pearce said he thinks so few
donations were made because the

3 people did not see the collection

basket.

, He said, however, “We are
pleased with every little bit we can
contribute to The United Way.”

The haunted house tour, which
izovered the basement and the sec-
end and third ﬂoors of the Lambda
Chi house, was planned and run by

the brothers of Lambda Chi and a
few other W&L student volunteers.

Several students were dressed as
witches, one as Dracula and one as
Jason, the serial killer from the
movie Friday the 13th.

“Jason” waved a chainless chain
saw while roaring chainsaw noises
played in the background, said
Pearce.

“This is the first year we have
had “Jason,” and he was definitely
the scariest to the children,” he
said.

The haunted house also featured
the “Grim Reaper” and a coffin.

Nancy Hickarn, a senior at W&L
and a tour guide for the haunted
house said, “It was fun to walk the
children through the house and see
their reactions. Many of the chil-
dren were very scared.”

Pearce said that overall,
haunted house was a success.

“The kids really enjoyed going
through the house, and the brothers
enjoyed putting it on,” he said.

“My fellow Atheists, it is my
great pleasure to address you as the
third century of Atheism draws to a
close. As we approach this anniver-
sary of intellectual freedom, I be-
lieve that it is important we under-
stand our tradition before we enter
the next era of our belief.

Never let us forget, we are still
pioneers; our movement is still
young. Man has believed in God for
thousands of years. Only the last
few generations have been able to
question, erode, and destroy his be-
lief in Him. In the annuls of histo-
ry, we are still young and a minor-
ity. Our continued success requires
that we remember this.

However, this should not
discourage us. From the writings of
only a handful of skeptics, we have
grown into one of the largest move-
ments in the world today. World
leaders, governments, cultures, soci-
eties, and individuals have come to
accept our belief. Our children can
proudly say that their ancestors nev-
er used inquisitors, torture chambers,
or armies to spread their belief. No,
ours is an intellectual revolution.

As we all know, the route to
change people's minds is to change
the way they speak. No other move-
ment has enjoyed such success with

The Ring-tum Phi, November 2, 1989

Atheism: our new religion?

the way we have redefined key
temts within the language. Perhaps
most important of these words is
the word religion. Pardon me, but
this has become our society’s black
word. It has been removed from our
children’s textbooks, it is now taboo
in intellectual conversation, and to
be considered religious is not only
an insult, it carries with it the im-
plication that one is fanatical. My
friends, allow me to repeat. When
you penetrate a culture’s language,
you alter the manner in which they
think. Here lies the beginning of our
success.

Definitions of words like God,
faith, heaven, hell, Christian, evil,
good, true, right have been all
re-written through our hard work. I
hate to dwell on a point, but I be-
lieve that our re-definition of two of
these words had been so crucial to
our success, that I must expound on
them.

The first of these two words is
heaven. We have integrated the
word heaven into our own worldly
vocabulary so well that we today
use it interchangeably with earthly
words like perfect or fantastic.
Sometime in the last three hundred
years, our culture has confused ulti-
mate divinity with something pleas-
ing here on earth. Today, we have
expressions like ‘Oh, the beach was
heavenly,’ or ‘God, her body is
heaven.’ Unlike our forefathers who
painted, sculpted, and conceived
spiritual perfection
which was removed from this earth,
today we perceive heaven as a
physical or secular perfection. In
other words, through language, we
have taken heaven away from God,
and placed it among mortal here on
earth. Why would anyone need God
if they can have heaven here on
earth?

Perhaps even more important
than our success with the word
heaven has been with the word
faith. Two thousand years ago, the
word faith was one of the big three,
right along with hope and love. To-
day, it is a dirty word. It suggests
that one’s brain is weak; that a per-
son is so incapable of finding his

‘own answers, he must trust someone

else’s. A young child has faith; you
and I have knowledge. And where

can man lind knowledge: In God?
In the Bible? In faith? No, the only
sources of knowledge our society
accepts 1S science.

Through language, then, we have
made it easier for man to not to
believe, than for man to believe.
This was the first half of our victo-
ry. The second was to destroy reli-
gion from the inside out.

Man today will go to church, but
he still feels that he should be able
to pick and choose his morality.
This moral grab bag mentality, fills
the "religious freak" with pride
when he successfully lives by one
or two of his chosen morals. How-
ever, you and I know better. When
society begins to destroy certain val-
ues of their moral code, they really
destroy the entire moral code. One
does not destroy the code which
states that two plus is two without

undermining the validity of one plus
one and three plus three. We have
nearly reached the point, my friends,
where a man can scarcely say that
any morality is anything better than
‘true for himself.’

Furthermore, as man has become
more and more religiously hollow
over the past three hundred years,
he has become less and less secure
that his watered down faith and mo-
rality was even at all correct. His
self confidence declined and he be-
came more inclined to accept the
other moral values which
contradicted the previous
generation’s values. Three hundred
years ago freedom of religious
thought was a laughable subject
among kings, parliaments, and even
religious leaders. They were all so
confident that their faith was the
true faith, they could impose it on
others with little feelings of insecu-
rity. Today, we enjoy not only a
freedom of religious thought, but a

freedom from religious thought. The »

religious backbone of our world has
been broken so extensively that
even religious leaders are loathe to
say that theirs is anything more than
possibly a correct answer.

My fellow Atheists, we have not
yet far to go until the religious
leaders will question if there even is
a correct answer, some say we have
reached that point today.”

according to Derrick.

“I don't want students to think
this is anything designed against
them. It’s necessary if we’re going
to keep the downtown a viable sec-
tor of the economy,” Derrick said.

“The attitude of this administra-
tion is that we recognize what the
school does for the community. But
we also recognize our duty to our
downtown merchants and other citi-
zens,” Derrick said.

“It’s important to the city that it
not be construed as directed at the
studenm,” he said.

Derrick said students who live in
downtown apartments will have to
find places to park other than the
street.

Derrick suggested they park in
one of the 12-hour parking lots
downtown, such as the Roy G.
Smith Parking Lot behind Leggett's.

“The last thing in the world we
want to do is create another prob-
lem for students, but they’re going
to have to begin to help seek a so-
lution to the problem,” Derrick
said.

Previously, the SAB had contrib-
uted money to the Superdance, but
the SAB’s current ﬁnancial prob-
lems precluded it from contributing
this year, said Turpin.

“We’re in a real bind this
year,” Turpin said. “We need mon-
ey from the IFC if we’re going to
get a real good band.”

Turpin said the committee is
currently trying to get the band
Drivin’ and Cryin’ for the Saturday
night portion of the Superdance, a
two—night dance marathon the pro-
ceeds of which go into research of
muscular dystrophy.

“We think the two-night format
is a great idea.” Tnrnin said. “The

whoawhoa, the metric system’s gotta go

lTHE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

(

In the good old days, sometime around the birth of
Christ, the American colonists had a big meeting and
decided that the country needed to agree on a national
system of measurement. Ben Franklin’s girlfriend, who
taught elementary school, suggested that the country
adopt the metric system, which was popular in Europe
and other primitive parts of the world, and everyone
laughed and told her to shut up. “Never,” shouted the
colonists in unison, “the metric system is too hard to
use, it’s got decimal points and makes no sense.”
Finally, George Washington's rousin Elrod, who
worked in a bakery, got everyone to agree on the foot-
pound cake system which made a heck of a lot more
sense. In the foot-pound cake system there are 12
inches in a foot,’ three feet in a yard and 100 yards in
A football field.

4
.I

Ever since those early colonial days, the foot-pound
cake cake units have grown on our culture the way
green-blue algae grows on milk that’s been in your
refrigerator since the late l960s (author's note — nice
metaphor). Here's a little taste of what life would be
like without our good friend, foot-pound cake:

“Golly geesh you should a seen the big ol’ cat
ﬁsh Bubba just caught in the crlck down yonder by
the railroad tracks. I’ll bet it’s 2.5 meters long and
weighs about 13.2 kilograms.”

After hearing this metric version of a mral fishing
story you ‘can't help but agree with the patriot, Patrick
“O” Henry, when he said, “Give me foot-pound cake
units or give me death or the bubonic plague or at
least a bad cold.”

Another great thing about the foot-pound cake
system is that every other country in the world uses
the metric system. This fact has one obvious
ramification:

It makes us look cool

And another that's not so obvious unless you take
military science courses:

It helps us during armed combat with foreign
countries

For the sake of this graphic demonstration, imagine
that the U.S. is at war with Canada and a Canadian
spy learns that we are planning an ambush 20 miles
north of a small bridge. Will the Canadians be waiting
there to ambush our ambush? Never. As far as they’re
concerned, 20 miles could be a secret way of saying
the w ole plan is a big joke (not to mention the fact
that t ey don't lmow what small bridge we’re talking
about.)

If, on the other hand, an American spy learns that
Canada is planning an ambush 20 kilometers from a
small bridge, he will quickly recognize that anything
ending in “eters” is a metric unit. He will make a
quick toll—free call to one of our foreign allies and ask
them about how long it_ _would take to run 20
kilometers, giving him a rough idea of where the
ambush will take place. And eventually (assuming we
know where the bridge is) the Canadian soldiers will
cut down like trees in a tropical rain forest.

After writing that last sentence I took a little nap
and had a dream that an irate reader named Laverne
broke into my house just to ask me one question,
which she kept repeating: “Why can’t the Canadlan’s
just convert the foot-pound units to metric units like
I learned how to do in elementary school?” Next,
Laverne turned into a gigantic ﬁre ant and began
eating my fumiture. But that’s not important because I
was dreaming.

Contrary to the popular belief of Laverne and every
elementary school teacher, a metric-foot conversion is
an extremely difficult process requiring paper, pencils,
a slide ruler, and years of training in vector calculus.
Therefore, getting back to our war with Canada, if the
Canadians wanted to convert our foot-pound cake units
into metric units, they would have to waste resources
on a Math Core — a team of highly trained, hom-
rimmed army geeks.

Now that we have proved, beyond a doubt, that

America needs the foot-pound cake system, it is time
to move on to the dreadful subject of those United
States politicians who have taken time out from their
busy schedules of mailing their constituents chain
letters and other political paraphernalia to advocate
America’s conversion to the metric system. (Golly
geesh, that last sentence was about 1.6 kilometers
long).

Of course, these politicians say that the metric
system is better than foot-pound cakes because it is
based on decimals and other mathematical jargon which
is easy to use. And of course, anyone with lawn-
mower intelligence knows that these politicians are just
giving into pressure from the Metric Lobby. For those
of you with kitchen appliance level intelligence, who
have never heard of the Metric Lobby, here's a quick
summary: the Metric Lobby is a coalition of metric
road sign painters, elementary school teachers, and
illegal European aliens who, for obvious reasons, want
to convert the country to the metric system. To
counteract the powerful Metric Lobby, I urge readers to
send their politicians chain letters predicting centuries
of disaster, hardship, and metric-foot-pound cake
conversion problems for politicians who do not
immediately denounce the metric system. (Author's
note — Long live the foot-pound cake).

Kathekon, the third year law

From News Releases

"C-130 rolling down the strip,
Airborne daddy gonna take a little
trip," was the jody call as the

‘Washington and Lee Ranger Chal-

lenge team approached the finish
line of the 10 kilometer forced road
march, ending a weekend of tough
competition.

The Ranger Challenge Brigade
competition, held Oct. 20-22 at Fort

pA.P. Hill, north of Richmond, was

the culminating point of six weeks
of 6:30 am daily training.

The Ranger Challenge competi-
tion is ROTC’s version of a varsity
sport. The objective of the competi-
tion is to test the ROTC cadet Ran-
gers‘ physical endurance and knowl-
edge of certain military skills, as
well as to test the true meaning of
the words teamwork and motivation.

The team, although largely
drawn from the ROTC Cadet Rang-
er Company, included several new
to the event this year. Freshmen
Daniel Spinosa, Brandon Neblett,
Jennifer Miller and Jennifer Carr,
and sophmores Trevor Hildebrand,
Bill Benson, Chris Prior and Kevin
Carl comprised the bulk of the
team. The W&L team was led by
junior Andrew Manson and advised
by senior Brian Snedeker. Man-
son’s leadership was especially cru-
cial during events such as the rope
bridge and the 10k road march.

The first day events consisted of
the Army Physical Fitness test (2
minute timed push-up and timed sit-
up, 2 mile run), a timed construc-
tion of a one-rope bridge across a
water obstacle (all of the team me-
mbers, rucksacks, and weapons must
cross on the rope), a one kilometer
run leading to a rifle range ﬁre
where team members fire 20 M-16
5.56 rounds at a grouping of ten
targets in five minutes or less, and
an orienteering course located in
difficult terrain of several square
miles.

The events held on the following
day included a grenade assault
course in which each competitor
throws a total of six exploding gre-
nade simulators at a variety of tar-
gets while negotiating an obstacle
course, a timed assembly and func-
tions check of the M-60 machine
gun and the M-16 rifle from a
mixed pile of parts, and finally, the
10k forced road march carrying
weapons and 30 lbs. each of equip-
ment.

This year was a building year
for the team. Despite having several
new members and the disadvantage
of W&L’s late start of the academic
year compared to other competing
schools, the team did very pleased
with its performance. The Ranger
Challenge team is looking forward
to next year and to some new faces
trying to make the team.

MotherNature aids new construction

Staff Reports

Thanks to mild October weather
and an otherwise warm construction
season, the Lenfest Center for the
Performing Arts at Washington and
Lee University should open its
doors in less than a year.

“The completion date is Septem-
ber 1, l990," said Frank A. Par-
sons, coordinator of capital plan-
ning, “and we are confident we will
meet that deadline.”

There are two critical periods in
the construction of a building, Par-
sons said. The first is actually get-
ting the building “up and out of the
ground.”

That phase of the center was ac-
complished this summer. The steel
skeleton of the main strucmre, rising

from the banks of Woods Creek, is
visible to passersby. _
“We had our usual problem
with Rockbridge County rock, and
the necessity to bring a good deal
of fill,” Parsons said. “But those
factors created only a slight delay.”
Soon a gate house and a walk-
way, utilizing the old railroad bridge
over Nelson Street, will connect the
center with the rest of the campus.
The train station by the center
will be used as storage area. As the
center expands, the station will be
put to other uses as well.
The nex_t critical phase of con-
struction will occur in the spring

when the acoustical and lighting
systems are installed.
When completed, the Lenfest

Center will feature a 425-seat main
theater, with a proscenium stage and

1. “I just believe that it’s un-
is American to_practice all week and
l then go for the tie,” said Washing-
fton and Lee head football coach
gGary Fallon after last Saturday’s
l heart-breaking 17-16 loss to Bridge-
; water.
3, Fallon was referring to his deci-
l sion to go for the two-point conver-
‘sion and the win rather than electing
 to kick a garne-tying extra point
iafter the Generals scored with 34
gseconds left to come within one
!point after BC had led by 14 with

L» Bridgewater led 17-3 late in e
§ﬁnal period, and things looked grim

[the defense was getting tired.

gerals little if any chance to come

-'( But what do the experts know
‘anyway? In a strikingly similar
,game to last year's BC—W&L clash,

‘back Phillip Sampson. .

for a gain of 15. A personal foul on
the Eagles moved the ball to mid-

hooked up for a gain of 16.
Sampson then found junior Chris
Acebal for nine yards.

After :1 sack, Sampson again
looked to Irons, who was interfered
with as he went to make the catch.
The penalty placed the ball at the
BC 21. On ﬁrst down, Sampson hit
Irons in the ﬂat for a gain of 10,
but Irons was jerked around by the
facemask by BC defensive back
John Coleman. The penalty put the
ball at the six, where Sampson
found senior fullback Russell Cros-
by in the end zone for a touchdown.
Junior Carter Quayle's PAT made it

The defense held and forced a
Bridgewater punt. Disaster struck for

‘the offense though. On their ﬁrst

No problem, said the defense.

' The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team completed its 1989 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference dou-

‘ble by clairriing the tournament title

, on Saturday with a 1-0 victory over
Virginia Wesleyan at Liberty Hall

‘ Field.

., Last weekend’s tournament was
the ODAC’s first post—season soccer

ttournament. W&L, 4-1-1 in the

‘ODAC, earned the top seed and the
honor of hosting the tournament by

eﬁnishing with the best regular-sea-
son ODAC record.

After ,winning. the, ODAC cnown .

,« on Saturday, head‘ coach --Rolf
Piranian said that the team had set
'' three goals for the 1989 campaign:
4 a winning season, the ODAC title,

and 10 victories.
On Tuesday, the Generals ac-

ig cornplished the last goal with a 4-1
victory over visiting VMI on the
last day of the season. The Hallow-

geen-day win gave the Generals a
final record of 10-5-2.

4 On Friday, senior goalkeeper
Jack Pringle preserved a 1-0 victory
over Harnpden-Sydney in the serniﬁ-

Qnal round of the tournament by

‘stopping a penalty kick late in the
game.

5 W&L scored its goal at 30:08 of
the second half when senior Patrick

‘Brown's shot went into the net off

‘the head of Harnpden-Sydriey full-
back David Sommerdahl.

'3 With 2:51 remaining in the

‘match, Hampden—Sydney was award-
ed a penalty kick after W&L was

Vwhistled for tripping inside the pen-

talty box. The Tigers attempt to tie
the score was denied when Pringle

fdove to his left to deflect Som-
merdah1’s free kick. Pringle

‘ﬁnished with seven saves. The Ti-

it Against Virginia Wesleyan in
Saturday's championship game,
more than 83 minutes of scoreless
(soccer went by before the Generals
scored the game's only goal at 6:13
bf the second half.

4 Brown, who had the ball midway

between the center circle and the
penalty box, arched a pass to senior
Scott Levitt, who glanced a shot
from eight yards out off a Blue
Marlin defender into the lower left
comer of the net.

The game was not over, though,
until Pringle dove and knocked
away a shot by a Blue Marlin play-
er as the siren sounded to end the
contest.

Pringle, who collected four saves,
registered his third straight shutout
of the season. Pringle's career total
for shutouts inched up to 12, leav-
ing him one shutout shy of tying
the school record.

“Three straight shutouts is quite

an’ "accomplishment considering.‘ the ,f

number of goals we’ve given up
this year,” Piranian said.

While freshman sweeper Greg
Williams continued his outstanding
play during the weekend, ‘it was
classmate Chase Davis who drew
the tough assignment of marking the
opposition’ top scorers. Both
Hampden-Sydney's Richard Ruth (7
goals, 3 assists) and Virginia Wes-
leyan’s Mike McFarland (7 goals, 6
assists) were held scoreless in their

games against W&L in the touma-
merit.

Playing in their fourth game in
less than a week, the Generals ap-
peared a bit ﬁat in Tuesday’s game
against VMI (5-7-1). Nevertheless,
W&L jumped out to 2-0 lead in the
first half.

Williams headed in his first goal
of the season at 16:16 off of a di-
rect kick from freshman Mike
Mitchem. The Generals scored their
second goal just over three minutes
later when Brown knocked in a run-
ning head shot off of Mitchem’s
comer kick. Mitchem’s two assists
gave him nine for the year, which
tied Brown's 1986 record for assists
in a season.

In the second half, W&L in-
creased its lead to 3-0 at 41:24
when Levitt received a pass Wil-
liams and sent a left-footed shot
into the right side of the net. At
6:34 VMI's Kevin Weiss cut the
lead to 3-1 after kicking a shot past
Pringle.

The Generals scored again at
2:26 when senior Hayward Lee,
playing in only his third game of
the season, netted the first goal of
his career of off an assist from
freshman Winthrop Allen.

From Staff Reports

Last week was a rough week for
the Washington and Lee volleyball
team.

The Generals lost four out of
five games, including three in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference play.
The last of which, to Emory and
Henry on Wednesday night, dropped
the team into a tie for fourth place
with two other teams.

The Generals started out strong
against the Wasps, winning the first
game 15-12. The Wasps, though,
were able to rebound and take the
next three to hand the Generals a
four-game setback.

Said head coach Susan Dittman
after Wednesday night’s game, “Ev-
eryone played better than they had
been against Emory and Henry. [Ju-
nior] Connie Papazickos did a good
job setting the ball for everyone,
and [senior] Debbie Grove did a
good job blocking. They beat us in
straight games every time we played
them last year, so we were pleased
to win a game off them this year.”

The Generals defeated Hollins
earlier in the week 15-12, 14-16,

15-6, 15-2, but in doing so lost one
of their team leaders in sophomore
Marcy Brown for a few games. Said
Dittman, “Marcy was a key loss for
us. She was very versatile and one
of our most spirited players."

Freshman Frances Ascher ﬁlled
in for Brown against Emory and
Henry, and according to Dittman,
she ﬁlled in admirably.

On the year, Dittman has been
pleased with the play of sophomore
Meria lVlcGowin and junior Lisa
Jay. “Mena has just been outstand-
ing for us all year long. She is our
best hitter and blocker for us. Lisa
has done a terrific job setting the
ball. Debbie has also come into her
own this year. She is one of our
most spirited players and leads the
team in desire.”

The Generals will begin play in
the first round of the round-robin
ODAC tournament tomorrow.
Through a tie-breaking procedure,
W&L was seeded sixth in the tour-
nament. W&L is paired with East-
ern Mennonite, E&H, and
Randolph-Macon Woman's College.
The Generals are 7-15 overall and
5-4 in ODAC play.

On the next play, Sampson was
sacked for a loss of 10. On second
down, Sampson's pass intended for
Irons was incomplete. On third and
20, Sampson found senior Scott
Jackson, one of last year's Bridge-
water heroes, for a gain of 18 to
the 21.

The play wasn't enough for a
first down, and it brought up a do-
or-die fourth down for all the mar-
bles play. As Sampson rolled to the
right, Sohonage was the intended
receiver and was wide open, but
Sampson found all kinds of rurming
room. As he turned the comer, he
got a terrific block from Sohonage
and waltzed into the end zone with
34 seconds to play for a touchdown.

On the two point conversion at-
tempt, Fallon called the same play
that Sampson scored on. Crosby
was the intended receiver, but fell
down coming out of the backﬁeld
and Sampson was forced to scram-
ble. He ﬂoated out to the right,
making time for receivers to work
free. With defenders closing in, he
lofted a pass in the direction of
Irons, but Brarrihall out-jumped the
W&L receiver to preserve the
Bridgewater win, 17-16.

The Washington and Lee water
polo team won the W&L Invitation-
al last weekend by coming from
behind to defeat Dayton University
in the championship game, 13-11.

V The Generals, who trailed by a
goal at halftime against Dayton,
upped their record to 19-3. They
have a chance at ﬁnishing with their
best record since 1981, when the
water polo team went 31-5.

However, the nineteenth win
didn't come easy. “It would have
been very easy to lose this game,"
said head coach Page..Remillard.
“We didn't adjust to Dayton’s de-
fense in the second quarter, [and]
we didn't adjust to the officiating. It
was difﬁcult to adjust to the incon-
sistency — its hard to play a differ-
ent sport every weekend.”

Remillard elaborated on the
team's problem with modifying their
offense to attack the Dayton de-
fense. “We weren't running what
we were supposed to run, and that’s
not like us. We made mistakes we
can’t afford to make in any game."

But W&L didn't run up such a
gaudy record without being re-
sourceful, and behind three goals
from sophomores Will Davis and
Jay Smith, and freshman Scott
Strader. W&L outscored Dayton 8-5
in the second half. Strader also had
ﬁve assists. Senior David Olson
more than canceled out Dayton’s 11
goals with the 15 blocks he regis-
tered for the game.

Remillard acknowledged that ear-
lier in the year, when his team was
more inexperienced, they probably
would have lost the game. The win,
said Remillard, was a yardstick of
how far the team has progressed
since the beginning of the year.

The Generals dominated their
other opponent, Johns Hopkins,
beating them twice by a combined
score of 31-11. The offense was
superb, as W&L brutally counterat-
tacked Hopkins again and again,
resulting in the avalanche of goals
from a multitude of scorers. Fresh-
man P.J. Waicus, backing up Olson
in the goal, made several inspired
saves in the ﬁnal quarters of the
two games.

Washington and Lee got an early
preview of how difﬁcult the cham-

oint try fails

Adrian Mobley scored from six
yards out. W&L answered with a
30-yard Quayle ﬁeld goal. Bndge-
water took a 10-3 lead into the ﬁnal
period as Jake Darrell kicked a 27-
yard field goal, settingthe stage for
W&L’s late game heroics.

The loss dropped the Generals to
4-4, 1-3 in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference play, with two 8331.35
remaining. This week, W&L W111

Polo subdues Dayton;

for tourney

pionsliip game could be on Saturday
afternoon, as Dayton was even with
them at halftime 5-5. In that game,
W&L woke up from a ﬁrst-half

funk to score nine second-half goals
and win 13-8. Sophomore Alan Her-
rick led the way with ﬁve goals,
and Davis and Smith each had
three.

Looking back from the ﬁrst
game to the second game, Rerriillard
praised Dayton for making better
adjustments for the championship,
saying that perhaps W&L was “out-
coached" in that respect.

However, he was also disappoint-
ed in the way his team responded to
his suggestions during a timeout he
called in the second quarter of the
final game. “We didn’t take the
information from the timeout back
with us into the pool,” he said. “I
was trying to take [Dayton] out of
their defense, but instead I had to
change our offensive set.”

This weekend is far and away
the biggest of the season for Wash-
ington and Lee. They host the
Southern Conference Championship,
a tournament that will determine
whether they are invited to the East-
em Championships, where the best
polo teams on the east coast will be
playing. Only the top two teams
from the Southern Conference will
be invited, and three teams stand
head and shoulders above the rest:
Arkansas-Little Rock, Richmond,
and W&L.

The Generals will play Rich-
mond Saturday at 5:00, and the
winner will get one of those two
invitations. A likely opponent for
W&L on Sunday (if they beat Rich-
mond) is Arkansas, who Remillard
calls “the best water polo team out-
side of California.”

In a game that bodes well for
the future of water polo at W&L,
the “B” team, which is made up of
freshman and inexperienced sopho-
mores, beat JHU 13-8 Saturday
morning. The Generals trailed 6-2 in
the second quarter, but hung togeth-
er and rallied to score eleven of the
last thirteen goals of the game and
win 13-8. Waicus came back from a
shaky beginning to get 10 blocks
and shut out Hopkins in the ﬁnal
quarter. James Dunleavy had four
goals to lead the offense, and John
Kannapell and Brad Martin added
two apiece.

You can live here... but not vote

 

By RJ. Thomas
Staff Reporter

You live here for most of the
year. You eat, sleep, and spend
money here, a lot of money, but
most likely you can't vote here.

Last year a group of students
tried to run a voter registration
drive but found it difficult. The lo-
cal registrar, Lucille Joyce, wouldn't
let students register. If you went to
her office she’d tell you that unless
you lived in Lexington year round
you couldn’t vote here and she’d
show you two almost entirely unre-
lated newspaper articles to prove it.
One of the articles was about stu-
dents doing jury duty and the other
was about qualifying for in-state
tuition rates for state schools. But,
though she may not have lmown it,
that registrar had much more power-
ful documents.

Virginia law allows anyone to
vote who has both domicile and
place of abode. Domicile is the im-
portant part. According to Lexington
and Rockbridge Circuit Court Judge
George Honts, an easy definition of
domicile is the place where your
home and your heart is. This is op-
posed to just living somewhere. A
soldier, for instance, may be living
in West Germany, but his home
may be in Virginia.

But who determines where your
home is? The law allows local reg-
istrars to do this. According to As-
sistant State Attorney General Greg
Haley, the local registrar is allowed
to make a case by case factual de-
termination of who is eligible to
vote in Lexington.

The qualifications spelled out in
Virginia law say that the deterrniria-
tion for who is eligible to vote is
based on certain criteria. Where you
live for the whole year, where your

Trick or treat!

Jeff Baucum offers a treat to one of the many Lexington children who
went trick-or-treating in W&L's Gaines Residence Hall Halloweeen night.
According to Catherine Baillio, head Gaines resident advisor and one. of
the event's organizers, W&L students participated by dressing up, playing
Halloween music or decorating their doors. Staff photo by Cary Baber.

car is registered and, a sore spot for
W&L students, where you pay
taxes. This raises the question of
“taxation without representation.”
But according to Haley being taxed
on personal property (the tax on
student cars would be a personal
property tax) doesn’t necessarily
give you the right to vote. If you
owned land here, for instance, but
dio‘n’t, live here, you could still be
taxed on the land and not be able to
bote.

Susan Fitz-Hugh, Secretary of
the State Board of Elections agrees
with these laws but says that there
are individual exceptions which can
be made. Exceptions can be made
on an individual basis for students
who have no where else to go, and
basically live in Lexington, even
though their base of support may
somewhere else. An example would
be a student whose parents live
overseas and has no residence any-

where else in this country.

In a case involving University of
Virginia students (Kegley v.
Johnson) a judge ruled that s stu-
dent by his mere presence in the
state does not give him the rights of
a citizen. This is especially impor-
tant in determining who qualifies for
in-state tuition at state school. Ac-
cording to the judgement, there must
be an intention to stay in the state
long after graduation. According to
the law, that intention manifests it-
self in things like registering you
car, paying taxes, how much time
you spend in the state, if you are
married and where your spouse
lives.

So as Virginia law reads, there is
no case to let ouH)f-state students
vote in Lexington. For them, the
current race is just a media show,
and displeasure with local govem-
ment will have to show itself in
other ways.

Huntley to speak

 

From the W&L News Office

Robert E.R. Huntley, former
president of Washington and Lee
University and now counsel and
Hunton & Williams in Richmond,
Va., will give the keynote address
for the W&L Legal Ethics Institute
to be held here next weekend.

The title of Huntley's lecture
will be “A Nation of Laws” and
will be given at 8 p.m. Friday, Nov.
10, in the Moot Courtroom of Lew-
is Hall. The lecture is open to the
public.

Huntley graduated with honors
from W&L in 1950 with a B.A. in
English. After serving as an officer
in the U.S. Navy, he returned to
W&L to earn his LL.B in 1957.
While in law school he served as
editor of the Washington and Lee
Law Review, vice-president of the
student body, and received the
Washington Literary Society Award
for “most distinguished service to
