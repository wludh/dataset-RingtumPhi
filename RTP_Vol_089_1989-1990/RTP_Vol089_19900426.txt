City approves Master Plan, Renaissance

By Brian Root
Editor

After several unanticipated delays,
the Lexington City Council last
Thursday approved Washington and
Lee's Master Plan, clearing the way
for the $12 million fraternity renova-
tion set to begin next month.

The city's Planning Commission,
which had been studying the plan for
weeks, unanimously recommended
that the plan be approved, said Coun-
cilman Sidney Brown.

Down to earth

“Obviously, we’re very pleased
that the city has approved the Master
Plan," said W&L Coordinator of
Capital Planning Frank Parsons.

Parsons said that, now that the
plan has been approved, renovation of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house on
Washington Street will begin in about
two weeks.

“The place is already empty,”
said Parsons. “We were just waiting
for final approval.”

Also, Parsons said, the renovation
of the fraternity houses in Red
Square will begin this summer, pend-

Charlotte

A former Washington and Lee
student has been arrested by the
Lexington Police Department and
charged with writing a $17,000 bad
check, according to Sergeant Torben
Pederson, the ofﬁcer in charge of the
arrest.

Pederson said police apprehended
William Gossman, a junior at Wash-
ington and Lee until his withdrawl
earlier this month, in Charlotte, NC
on April 18.

“He was apprehended in North
Carolina after being entered into the
NCIN, or National Crime Information
Network. He waived his extradition
rights and was brought back to Lexi-
ngton,” Pederson szid.

Pederson said Gossman had pur-
chased a car at Lexington Motor
Sales April 3, the same day he with-
drew from school, according to Reg-
istrar Scott Dittman. The police be-
came involved in the case April 11.

“Between those times there had
been negotiations between the dealer-
ship and he and his parents in North
Carolina. He said he would make the
checks good and never did, so a
warrant was issued for his arrest.
Since it was for a check for over
$200, it is a felony offense, and we
get involved in all felonies,”
Pederson said.

Pederson said he hoped Goss-
man’s preliminary hearing would be
held in early May. If convicted,
Gossman will be charged with a
larcenous offense, which carries a
maximum sentence of ten years in
prison. However, Pederson said he
thinks Gossman will receive only
probationary time, because his crime
was non-violent and because he will
have reimbursed the dealership by the
time of the trial.

Pederson said he had also been
investigating a female who had been
traveling with Gossman.

ing approval of site plans by the city.

Parsons said that each fraternity
located in Lexington’s historic district
can only be renovated after the build-
ing plans are approved by the Lex-
ington Architectural Review Board.

The renovations of the Pi Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, Phi Delta Theta,
Beta Theta Pi, Phi Kappa Sigma and
SAE houses are scheduled to be com-
pleted by next January, according to
Parsons.

The entire fraternity renovation,
Parsons said, should take 18 months
to two years.

“The actual plan is supposed to
take a year and a half,” said Parsons.
“But we're assuming we'll run into
some small delays either with the city
or the builders.”

Parsons said he originally ex-
pected the plan to gain approval by
the first week in April, but that the
city raised unanticipated objections to
some of the plan’s proposals.

“We originally wanted to close
off the one block of Henry Street that
runs through Red Square into a one-
way street," said Parsons. “Unfortu-
nately, some members of council

campus, and a bronze replica will replace it high atop the Colonnade.
The process of restring the statue and making the replica Is expected
to take about a year. For more photos and a story about the statue, see

raised some objections to that, so we
backed down.”

In addition to the renovation of
the fraternity houses, the proposal
calls for a sidewalk to be built in
front of the Phi Delta Theta house
and the two-hour parking spaces on
Henry Street be switched to in front
of the Sigma Nu house, he said.

At the Thursday meeting, Council-

woman Louise Moore asked if, under

the present deﬁnition of “university-
adrninistered ‘ fraternity or sorority

Approval by Lexington City
Council Thursday of a zoning amen-
dment as part of Washington and
Lee’s revised Master Plan will per-
mit construction, beginning in the
winter of 1992, of four sorority hou-
ses.

According to Laurel Ann Heis-
kell, the Panhellenic Housing Chair-
man, the University’s blueprints show
houses for Chi Omega, Kappa Kappa
Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta in
the Davidson Park area, and a Delta
Gamma house where Kappa Sigma
now stands.

Following the move by Kappa
Sigma into the renovated Zeta Beta
Tau house, the Kappa Sigma house
will be razed to make way for a new
building to house the yet-to-be-colo-
nized Delta Gamma Sorority. q j

V The exact date for ‘beginning
construction is dependent on the
completion of the fraternity house
renovations, all a part of the Frater-
nity Renaissance Plan included in the
new Master Plan.

The proposed sorority houses will
be similar in structure to the existing
fraternity houses but will differ on

havior for fraternities.

“I hope this wouldn’t allow the
school to decide it no longer wants to
regulate the fraterni“-es at some later
date,” said Moore.

“If W&L tells us that they're no
longer in the behavioral modiﬁcation
business," said City Manager Joe
King, ‘‘we’ll tell them we’re no
longer in the business of allowing
fraternities.’ ’

approve the Master Plan, with Coun-
cilman Brian Shaw, W&L’s Director
of Communications, abstaining.

Council, according to PHC president
Nancy Mitchell.

Heiskell said each house will
probably be two-stories high with a
full basement, living room, dining
room, and perhaps a number of bed-
rooms depending on the opinions of
the individual sororities. Industrial
kitchens would be necessary to serve
an entire chapter, as well. The cost
of living in these houses would be
comparable to present campus hous-
ing, said Heiskell.

Results of a survey conducted by
the Housing Comittee and distributed
to all sorority members are currently
being processed. The survey asked
sorority members to respond accord-
ing to what they believe women who
have not been exposed to W&L as an
“unhoused campus” would want. The
questions targeted areas such as types
of rooms necessary, the number of
bedrooms, types of meal plans, and
the necessity of a house mother.

An amendment to the Panhellenic
Constitution was passed allowing
active sorority members and pledges
to attend “collegiate social functions,

pplahuds SAB, FD budget figures

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee applauded Student
Activities Board officers Monday night after the
SAB presented its winter term budget report
and an outline of planned spring concerts.

The SAB entertainment budget ended winter
term over $8,500 in the black. That money will
be added to the $7,0()0 spring term allotment.

As of this spring, the SAB will have spon-
sored more activities than it did last year, but
it will be in better ﬁnancial shape, according to
SAB Chairman Charles Conklin and SAB
Entertainment Director Michael Applebaurn.
Last year’s SAB ended the year more than
$20,000 in debt.

SAB ofﬁcers announced the following
concerts for spring term: New Potato Caboose
was at General Headquarters last night; a free
concert by Tunji at the Law School on April
27; a free Mother’s Day concert by The Truly

Masseuse must go
back to school

Dangerous Swamp Band on the Colonnade Sat-
urday afternoon of Alumni Weekend, May 13;
Dash Rip Rock performing at GHQ on May 16
at 8:30 p.m.; and Valence at GHQ on May 18,
also "at 8:30 p.rn.

The SAB plans to co-sponsor a concert on
May 25 with the lnterfratemity Council for
Springfest, said Conklin, and if money remains
after all these concerts, they may plan more ac-
tivities.

The SAB’s winter term success comes in
the wake of a similarly successful Fancy Dress
budget hearing last month.

FD Chairman Alexander Hitz reported to the
EC on March 26 a surplus of $12,663 with
about $11,000 in outstanding bills yet to be
paid, indicating that FD roughly paid for itself
this year. Duwel told The Ring—tum Phi last
September that “FD is in theory supposed to
pay for itself  [but] it never has [before].”

Hitz estimated that almost 1,100 couples
attended the ball this year, exclusive of SAB
members and faculty. Thatrﬁgure fell somewhat

short of expectations, possibly because the Law
School was on break, but EC President Willard
Dumas called the attendance “very close to the
number projected.”
Dumas commended Hitz and the FD com-
mittee members on their dedication and success.
Conklin and Hitz warned that the financial
ﬁgures released at that EC meeting are not
ﬁnal, and will not be deﬁnite until the accoﬁt
is closed. However, Hitz said he was “really
pleased with how everything came out.”

The EC appointed Claude Worrell Chairman
of the White Book Revisions Committee and
named eight other students to the committee.
They are: Keith Duet, Hill Goodspeed, Mat-
thew Malloy, Duncan Miller, Jennifer Spreng,
Bradley Turner, Joshua van Hulst and Robert
Wilson.

According to Spreng, the committee met
once to break into smaller, working groups, and
planned to meet again today as a whole.

The EC also heard a budget request from
Trident on March 26. They requested $6,400 to

cover part of the projected $9,500 expense for
Confetti’s weekend on May 25-26. Rather than
allotting a budget, the EC told Trident represen-
tatives that the EC would cover expenses up to
$4,470. Trident hopes to raise an additional
$2,700 on their own.

The Minority Student Association presented
a budget report showing a balance of just under
$1,300. They projected a final balance of zero
at year’s end. Highest among MSA’s expenses
were a Martin Luther King recognition recep-
tion for $600, and $479 for T-shirts to be sold
at Springfest.

MSA President James Rambeau said the
MSA had not decided on a design for the
T-shirts. Sophomore EC Rep. Caroline Wight
recommended that Rambeau investigate cospon-
sorship of the T-shirts with other Spring-
fest-sponsoring organizations and that the design
be commemorative of the event.

The Volleyball Club reported a total spend-
ing Of $762.60, $12.60 over their allotment. The
money primarily paid tournament fees and dues.

Masseuse Lindy Felix is going to
have to wait until she graduates from
a certiﬁed massage program before
she can get her hands on Lexington.

Lexington City Council amended
an ordinance last week allowing
certified masseurs to escape the $1-
500 “nuisance fee” required of thera-
pists who want to do business in
town.

According to an article in The
Ring-tum Phi Jan. 25, Felix was
enrolled in a state—certiﬁed program.
She is working at the Staunton Ath-
letic Club and in private homes
around Lexington, the Phi reported.

As passed, the ordinance with
amendment exempts therapists who
work under the supervision of doctors
and other health practitioners, athletic
trainers and, now, certiﬁed masseurs.

According to councilwoman Lou-
ise Moore, Felix does not have a
shop in Lexington because she is not

certified by the American Massage
Therapist Association or the state
board of education.

In January, Felix appealed to the
Social and Economic Services Com-
mittee of the city council to have the
$1500 fee changed to a revenue-based
tax. Tliursday’s passage is the end-
result of her appearance.

The Ring-tum Phi was unable to
contact Felix by press time.

Lexington’s only massage thera-
pist, Elizabeth Gammon, says the
amended ordinance won’t affect her.
Right now, she is working under the
supervision of Chiropractor Linda
Larsen, and thus exempted from the
tax. Gammon, who graduated from a
certiﬁed massage school, has been
working for Larsen for about a year
and a half, said Larsen.

According to popular wisdom,
massage therapists are merely a eu-
phemism for an older, less reputable
profession. The purpose of the “nui-
sance tax” is to prevent prostitution
from coming to Lexington under the
guise of massage therapy.

 OPINION

it’s that time of
year again

Welcome back. Welcome to spring term. Welcome to
a six-week period unlike anything at any other college
or university (that we know of). If you managed to
manipulate your schedule properly, you will be through
with classes for the week by the time you read this.
Needless‘ to say, that presents some unique social
opportunities.

As you already know, spring term is, in essence, a
good time. Some of the best parties of the year will be
thrown in the next month or so. That, combined with
the fact that most of us are taking only two classes,
means we can all have a blast at a relatively small
amount of risk to our GPA’s.

However, it also means something else. With more
spare time and more parties come increased risk to
everyone. To recommend that drinking be curtailed
would be pointless as well as impractical. Besides, only
those without sin should cast the first stone.

What we do recommend, however, is that when you
do go to parties, or to Goshen, or wherever, please
drink responsibly. Make sure there's someone sober to
drive you home, be it a friend or Live Drive, or even
someone you met in Lloyd’s 20 minutes ago.

If the holier-than-thou approach isn’t working, let’s
try a new argument.

The Lexington police, the state police, and the
Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board also know
that it’s spring term, and you better believe they’ll be
out to get you when you screw up. Nothing would
make us happier than to have a nice, peaceful term
without having to print any stories about students
getting busted, especially since the EC doesn’t like it
when we do that.

It’s not just for
liberals anymore

I c 0 ‘
On occasion, issues appear that command the attention

and passion of everyone, whether conservative or liberal.
The conservation of the environment should be one of
them, like it or not.

In the last 19 years that Earth Day has existed, it was
just one of those innocuous little holidays that no one
noticed. Arbor Day, anyone? Suddenly, almost out of

nowhere, it 2 was: "EARTH :f.DAY',' A and P" an‘yo'ne”who ‘(was I“

environmentally conscious was all over the news decrying
the plight of our planet. Now, almost as suddenly, it’s
over, at least nationally.

That seems to be the trend these days with big issues.
An issue will come along to inﬂame the passion in us all
and then disappear.

If you really want to accomplish something for the
betterment of our world, every day should be Earth Day,
not just when CBS tells you it is.

Saving the environment is the most bipartisan of issues,
and one which must command our everyday attention.

Our congratulations go to the Outing Club for the
schedule of events for this week, and we hope you attend
some, if not all, of them.

Their message is an important one, perhaps the most
important of our generation. We would all do well to
listen more than just once a year.

To our readers

This week, the new editors of The Ring—tum Phi,
Patricia Lopes and Brian Root, have nobly attempted to
take over (with lots of help from their friends). Please
bear with us as we try to make the transition. Our
thanks go Genienne Mongno, James B. Lake, Greg
Euston, Stacy Morrison and Pamela Kelley.

‘Democratic’

MY VIEW
-.By;rAla-n;:Heinrich—::.‘rr.it ~

The recent democratic revolutions in Eastern
Europe provide western audiences not only with a
reprieve from the same old wom-out headlines, but
also with an opportunity to reﬂect upon the status
of some of the words invoked so often in our own
culture, in so far as they are understood by the
leaders of our government and of the mass media.
Needless to say, at the forefront of these words
would be “democracy.”

As a general rule, democracy is understood by
the aforementioned men and women in temrs of
the old show-biz formula, “Ya either got it or ya
don’t.” Throughout the ﬂurry of revolutionary
change in Europe, I do not recall a single reﬂec-
tion in the mainstream media or in the govem-
mental agencies upon which they rely for so much
of their information, among neither the pundits nor
the politicians, apropos the challenges and ambi-
guities of “democracy.” However, as is obvious
from the etymology of the word — from two Greek
roots, “demos" and “kratos,” meaning “people"
and “power,” as we all recall from junior high -
— as well as from the spirit of the Declaration of
Independence and from other essential documents
upon which our nation was founded, “democracy”
in reality in no way signifies a static entity. There
are an infinite number of degrees in which democ-
racy — in contrast to oligarchy — may be realized.
That is to say, the degree to which a government
truly represents the interests of the population at
large, rather than a small, privileged elite, is the
measure of the integrity of a nation's democracy.

There is an exception to this general rule, to
this widespread belief in such a mystical and static
entity, Democracy: it is the equally widespread
term “ﬂedgling democracy." A favorite expression
of the Somoza clan (I believe the elder Anastasio
coined it; at any rate, it had a special place in his

We would like to make a few remarks con-
cerning the open hearing held last Tuesday that
resulted in the expulsion of one of our brothers,
Jeffery Trussell. Although we are in a state of
disbelief about the outcome of the trial, we
realize that the Honor System is not to be
blamed for the events that led up to the hearing.
Furthermore, we do not feel that he was denied
a fair trial in any way, or that the actions of the
jurors or advocates were prompted by any mo-
tives save for their duties to the Honor System.

In an imperfect world, we realize that not
even the most time-honored traditions can live up
to our expectations. Our first reaction is to reject
the Honor System for the suffering it has caused
Jeff and his family. Yet, we realize Jeff knew the
Honor System carried certain responsibilities, and
the severe punishment for any violation of that
system.

Although many aspects of the case were hazy
and inconsistent, one thing remained true
throughout the proceeding: that Jeff never for an

Reagan, Dan Quayle and myriad political commen-
tators to refer to Central American governments
that practice terrorism on an administrative level.
While the ordinary campesino is often a target of
these U.S.-founded, trained and funded armies, the
most regular customers are the priests and labor
activists who are trying to organize the peasants
into a politically cohesive force. In other words,
the death squads essentially target the political
opposition while making their frequent murderous
rounds.

A country that routinely be-
holds the murder of its op-
position Ieaders  is a far
cry from being democratic.

Now, it should be obvious that a prerequisite to
a healthy representative democracy is an open
forum for debate and the existence of an opposition
party to provide the people with , electoral choice.
Clearly, a country that routinely beholds the
murder of its opposition leaders (regardless of
whether the civilian leadership —- for example,
Christiani or Cerezo — is corrupt (as the evidence,
such as the absence of any successful prosecution
of the perpetrators of these anti-democratic acts
suggests), or simply irripotent and serving as the
figureheads of military states for the betterment of
their nation's international image) is a far cry from
being democratic, ﬂedgling or otherwise. Add to
this the fact that voting is mandatory in El Salva-
dor and Guatemala, as well as the fact that voting
boxes are transparent and curious army personnel
are omnipresent — i.e., in these countries, plagued
by state terror, there are no secret ballots — and
you have very peculiar democracies indeed.

We believe he was the victim of a vicious set

It is because of this great respect for Jeff that
we look with dismay on the outcome of the trial.

Upon reﬂection, this usage is not an exception,"
to the “general rule” discussed above; both the
general usage of the -word democracy as well as
the term ﬂedgling democracy together indicate any
obliviousness to the very spirit of democracy itself
on the part of politicians and mediagogues. That is,’
the challenges implied by a form of government
that ideally is a government “of the people, fort
the people, and by the people” are ignored.

This ignorance has far-reaching consequences.‘
The institution that defines, and thereby in essence‘
creates, public opinion, along with the individuals
and bureaucratic structures that pander to this)
public opinion, together profess the heresy that we ,
needn't be vigilant in defence of true democratic ‘
representation; again, because you either got it on
you don’t. On the contrary, it seems all the more
necessary on this account to raise the empirical"
question regarding the degree of democracy in our ,
nation. For example, what is the status of the
political opposition here? Do citizens really have ai
meaningful choice given our two-party system? As t-_
the miserable voter tumouts indicate, many citizens I
seem to think that they do not. But the basic point It
here is that this empirical question is an important
one, yet is one that is obscured by powerful *
institutions of American society. ,

I am afraid, however, that it is not simply
ignorance that obscures the importance of thisi
question. I believe that there are many here who
are downright disdainful of democracy. In a con-5
versation I had with an employee of the Heritage
Foundation, one of the most powerful and most
heavily funded of all the so—called “think—tanks,” .
I commented on the irrirnorality of U.S. Central
American policy, to which he responded, “All that ~
matters is what is in the interests of the U.S.” I
then asked him how such interests could be ca1cu— 
lated, and whether they would represent some 6
qualitative mean of the interests of the citizenry as
a whole. To this he replied, “I’m not that much of L
a democrat." He wasn't referring to the political

Medals will be awarded to the top
three relays, the top three men and
the top three women. In addition,
every participant is given a T-shirt.

Race sponsors include Theta and
ﬁve local businesses — Fantasies,
Travel Unlimited, Pappagallo, Marie's

Flush contact
may be curtailed

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

Fratemity and sorority winter term
grades were released, and possible
curtailing of open contact during next
fall’s rush was discussed at Tuesday
riight’s lnterfraternity Council meet-
ing.

All three sororities came out
ahead of the fraternities, with Chi
Omega leading the pack. Kappa Sig-
ma led the fraternities, followed by Pi
Kappa Alpha and Lamda Chi Alpha.

Chi-O had a 3.105 GPA for the
winter term, followed by Kappa Kap-
pa Gamma with a 3.051 and Kappa
Alpha Theta with a 2.954

Kappa Sigma’s winter term GPA
was 2.916, moving them up to first
place from their second place fall
berth. Sigma Chi, which had the
highest fall term grades, fell to fifth
place in the winter rankings.

In his first meeting as IFC Presi-
dent, Goodloe Lewis said that the
Student Affairs Committee, which
makes final approval of the IFC’s
rush calendar, is considering scratch-
ing at least one day of open contact
between freshman and fraternity
members next fall.

According to Lewis, the commit-
tee will meet to discuss the proposed
rush changes on May 3 and will

up will be on Monday.

The Outing Club has said that if

project. Our sorority chooses a na-
tional philanthropy project each year
and every Theta chapter works for
that project,” Logan said.

According to Logan, CASA was
started by a judge to help abused
children in the court system.

“CASA is a mediator between the
child’s parents and the social worker.
The child is torn between these two
people. The advocate spends time
with the child to represent him and
give the judge a more objective view
of the child’s life than the parents or

social worker can," Logan said.

Logan said about 40 people par-
ticipated in the triathlon last year.
She said she expects about the same
turnout this year.

“We were pretty well supported
last year. From the entries so far this
year, we have people from VMI, the
law school and W&L," Logan said.

“The past two years the race has
been in late May, but we moved it
this year so people from the law
school and VMI could be involv .”

Logan said the triathlon was

started several years ago by the
ROTC department. Three years ago
two students from the Executive
Committee sponsored it with Student
Activities Board funds. When there
were no sponsors for the event last
year, Logan suggested that her chap-
ter organize the event.

“It was our pledge project, and
we decided to make it an annual
race. The athletic department was
excited about the idea and wanted it
to be annual too,”Logan said.

“My sorority wanted to do some-

thing to be involved in a positive
way on campus. We can do a lot of
philanthropy off campus, but we
wanted to be involved here, too. We
want to give back to the school some
of what it does for us. We can be
active at W&L and help other people
at the same time.”

Logan said it is not too late to
join the Kappa Alpha Theta Triathlon.
Participants can register in front of
the gym from 7:45 - 8:45 a.m. Sun-
day before the race. The registration
fee is $15.

During W&L’s first sorority rush,
in January, actives and pledges were
unable to participate in any collegiate

D-Hall gets

liquor license

Chemistry Professor Dr. J. Keith Shillington was

Evans Dining Hall has been granted a new liquor

scheduled to undergo minor surgery today at the Uni-
versity of Virginia Hospital, according to Chemistry
Professor Dr. William Watt.

Although Watt said he was uncertain about the exact
nature of the surgery, he said it is related to Shillington’s
“general physical condition," not to the rrrild stroke he
suffered earlier this year. Watt said Shillington had been
recuperating from the stroke at the Rehabilitation Center
in Waynesboro when he developed a condition which
necessitated his move to the Charlottesville hospital.

According to an article in the Feb. 15 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi, Shillington suffered a mild stroke Jan. 10
and spent ten days in Stonewall Jackson Hospital. He
then underwent therapy at Stonewall Jackson Extended
Care Facility to regain use of the left side of his body
before being moved to Waynesboro.

Watt said it is too soon to predict whether Shillington
will be back in the classroom next year.

“He was hoping to teach next year, but we'll have to
see what his health is like,” Watt said.

license which will allow for a more extensive catering
service, according to Gerald Darrell, Director of the
University Food Service.

According to Darrell, the Dining Hall’s new Annual
Catering License allows them to serve beer, wine and
hard liquor at Dining Hall-catered events at the Dining
Hall and in the Lexington Community.

Darrell said that in the past, the Dining Hall received
24-hour Mixed Beverage Permits in order to serve
alcohol.

However, the extensive use of their catering service
has made the armual license more feasible. Darrell
explained that one 24-hour Mixed Beverage Permit costs
$35, while the annual license costs $1,300.

Evans Dining Hall does not serve alcohol at functions
they cater for student organizations. Darrell said that this
policy will not change because of the new license.

If any person younger than 21 is caught by an ABC
agent drinking alcohol at a Dining Hall event, the Dining
Hall would lose its liquor license, said Darrell.

to jump
for heart

 

By Kelly McCabe
Staff Reporter

The many activities plarmed for
National Health Education Week will
help make everyone “aware of the
effects of diet and exercise on the
heart," said Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Anne Schroer-Lamont, who co-
ordinated the activity committee.

Friday’s Jump Rope for Heart is
one of the week's highlights, said
Schroer-Lamont. Fraternities and
sororities, as well as other groups
including the biology department,
have entered teams in the event,
which is a fund raiser for the Ameri-
can Heart Association.

In the past two years, Washing-
ton and Lee has raised more money
than any other university in Virginia,
and Schroer-Lamont said she hopes
this year’s event will raise $2,000,
which would top last year’s total by

200

%

Jump Rope for Heart, co-spon-
sored by the Intramural Club, will be
held at the Doremus Gymnasium
parking lot, and begins at 12:30 p.m.

Blood cholesterol and blood pres-
sure tests will be administered in the
side dining room of Evans Dining
Hall on Friday morning from 8:30
until 10:00, followed by a healthy
breakfast, Schroer-Lamont said.

The cholesterol test is free to the
first 50 participants, and there will be
a minimal charge for others. There is
no charge for the blood pressure test.

Schroer-Lamont said anyone par-
ticipating in the cholesterol test
should not eat breakfast before the
test, because this will make the re-
sults less accurate.

Participants will be notified of
their test results by the health center
in the following weeks, she said.

Evans Dining Hall is also offering
special “healthy heart" menu items
this week. Literature on cholesterol
awareness, vitamin facts, and eating
disorders is also available in the

lobby.

Peter M. Gresshoff, Racheff Chair of Excellence
in Plant Molecular Genetic at the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville, will speak at W&L May 3,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The topic of Gresshoffs lecture is “Research
Advances and Applications of DNA Diagnosis in
Plants.” He will also lecture May 4 on “Molecular
Genetic Analysis of Nodulation in Soybean.”

The University of Termessee in Knoxville received
a major donation from Ivan Racheff to establish an
international research focus in an area of plant science.
This was coupled with the Termessee-wide Chairs of
Excellence program.

In January 1988, Gresshoff was appointed to the
program as professor of plant molecular genetics. Prior
to that, he taught at the Australian National University,
where he also received his doctorate degrees and
served as a research fellow.

Gresshoff’ s area of research is in the developmental
genetics of nodulation in legumes and he has published
widely on the subject.

The Racheff Chair is staffed with seven post-
doctoral/seriior faculty staff, several visiting professors,
and highly qualified technical, secretarial and
maintenance staff. The Chair teaches masters and
doctorate students and is involved in the teaching of
molecular genetics and developmental plant
biocherriistry/biology.

The lecture is sponsored by the Telford Lecture
Series at W&L.

Eleanor Holmes Norton, chairwoman of the
United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) from 1977 to 1981 and
professor of law at Georgetown University Law
Center, will deliver the annual Elizabeth Lewis Otey
Lecture at W&L Wednesday, May 2.

Norton will speak at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel. The
topic of her lecture will be civil rights and her
current work on affirmative action.

Hailed by rights activists and employers alike for
her unique ability to effect change, Norton is a
recognized authority on an impressive range of
domestic issues, including affirmative action,
comparable worth, family issues and race and sex
matters.

As the first woman to chair the EEOC and, prior
to that, the New York City Commission on Human
Rights, Norton has been highly regarded for her work
in developing equal employment law and policy, and
in using efficient systems that reformed EEOC
operations and reduced its large backlog of cases for
the first time in the Agency’s history.

As the EEOC chairwoman, Norton administered
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay
Act, the Age Discrirriination in Employment Act and
Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act covering
handicapped iridividuais.

Norton was educated at Yale Law School, Yale
Graduate School (M.A., American Studies) and Antioch
College. She has co-authored a book, Sex

WHO’S ON THE HILL

  

Discrimination and the Law: Causes and Remedies,
and is currently writing a book about the development
and impact of anti-discrirriination law and affirmative
action remedies in an effort to help clarify public
understanding.

She has received many honors, including 28
honorary degrees, and serves on a variety of boards,
among them the Rockefeller Foundation, the Yale
Corporation, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for
Social Change and the Pitriey Bowes corporation.

The Otey Lecture Series at W&L is named for
Elizabeth Lewis Otey, a pioneer in the women's rights
movement from Lynchburg, Va. Otey, who died in
1974 at the age of 93, was among the first Suffragettes
who marched on the White House in the early part of
this century in support of the women's rights
movement.

The Otey Lecture Series was established at
Washington and Lee in 1987 by E. Otey Watson of
Lynchburg, Otey’s daughter. The series is dedicated to
bringing recognized women of achievement to the
W&L campus. The first three Otey lecttirers were
Colorado Congresswoman Patricia Schroeder, NPR

Sculpture and drawings by Larry M. Stene,
associate professor of art at W&L will be on exhibit
in duPont Gallery April 23 to May 18.

An opening reception and slide/lecture by Stene
will be held in duPont Hall tonight at 7 p.m.

The exhibit will consist of several wall-oriented
relief sculptures of sculptural reliefs that have texture
and pattern as the emphasis. The textures and patterns
are created with mixed media and found objects. The
exhibit also includes a selection of drawings in ink,
graphite, and pastel with landscapes as a theme.

This is Stene's second one-person exhibit at W&L
and features works produced over the last two years.
His last one-person show at W&L was in 1983.

Stene joined the W&L faculty in 1982. He holds a
B.S. degree in art from Moorhead State University and
an M.F.A. in art from the University of Illinois.

duPont Gallery hours are Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The University-Rockbridge Symphony Orchestra
will appear in Lee Chapel on Saturday, April 28
1990.

Their program is destined to include those golden
olden hits of the nineteenth century.

The program is called “The Symphony plays the
Hits*” (*the hits of the nineteenth century, that is.)

Sponsored by Washington and Lee and the Fine
Arts in Rockbridge program, this is the first time this
program will appear in Lexington before it plays again.
The orchestra may or may not go on tour in the near
future. The orchestra has appeared in the past.

Jan Hathom looks absolutely
nothing like Herb Brooks. But they
do have some similarities.

Back in 1980, Brooks coached the
United States Olympic hockey team
to art improbable gold metal. Im-
probable because no one expected
them to do as well as they did.

This season, Hathom has taken
the Washington and Lee women's
lacrosse program to a level few
people expected them to reach in just
two years.

Said Hathom, “We are a hard
working team. Everyone has worked
together to get us where we are.
We've had some great performances
by different players, but it’s not fair
for me to single people out. We are
a team without a star. We're success-
ful because we put things together as
a unit.”

The unit complied a 9-6 regular
season record, going 5-2 in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference games,
good for second place in the stand-
ings and the second seed in the con-
ference tournament.

“We're peaking at the right
time,” said Hathom before the game.
“We played some tough games early
on in the season, and we got in
shape to play at the end of the year.
We scored 60 goals in our last ﬁve
[regular season] games. I think that
shows we’re peaking now.”

Wednesday,, Hathom and the
peaking Generals played host to
Sweet Briar in the opening round.
Said Hathom before the game, “Last
season we went into the tournament

vSPORTS
Generals streak into tourn

and surprised some people. This year
people will be after us, and I am
expecting a very tough game from
Sweet Briar."

The Generals, a quick starting
team of late, wasted no time in tak-
ing the lead. Junior Shawn Wert
supplied the early scoring as the
Generals jumped out to a 4-0 lead.
The defense was doing the job also,
as sophomore goalie Erica Ingersoll
saw only two shots in the first half.
W&L led at the midway point 7-1.

Said Hathom, “The girls met last
night and decided they wanted to
score as many in the second half as
they did in the first. Lately, we have
been playing strong ﬁrst halves and
weak second halves. Today we played
a full game.”

W&L put up six goals in the
second half and sophomore Jennifer
Donaldson took over in goal and
made five saves. Senior Jennie Brent
scored a goal in what could be her
last home game. Wert and sophomore
Kimberly Bishop scored four goals
each. Freshman Lisa Dowling had
two while junior Melinda Conkling
and freshman Jennifer Singleton also
scored. _

The Generals closed the regular
season in impressive fashion, winning
four straight games to extend their
winning streak to ﬁve, four in the
ODAC.”Two of the conference wins
came on the road over Hollins (7-5)
and Randolph-Macon (10-5). W&L
defeated Sweet Briar (12-4) and Gou-
cher (13-5) at home.

To start the four-game stretch,
Wert scored four goals in the con-
quest of Sweet Briar, avenging last
year's 10-9 loss. Wert contributed
four other goals against Hollins, R-

  

From W&L Sports Information

The 1990 season for Washing-
ton & Lee's baseball team came
to an end yesterday afternoon
with a 3-2 loss to top-seeded
Hampden-Sydney in the first
round of the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference tournament. The
Generals ﬁnished with a record of
5-15, 3-12 in the ODAC.

Senior Jolm Morris continued
to hold the top spot in the na-
tion's Division III tennis rankings
as he helped W&L to a 2-3 week
in Florida. The Generals lost to
Division I Central Florida (7-2),
top ten Division H Rollins (7-2)
and top ten NAIA North Florida
(9-0). W&L beat Division I
Stetson (5-2) and NAIA Florida
Tech (5-4). W&L is ranked 15th

Thursday brings a meet at Bridge-
water for the Generals, and Leslie
said the team will use the meet for
two purposes. “The meet gives us
another chance to play everyone else
in the ODAC, plus Bridgewater is the
host school for the ODAC Champion-
ships next week. Also, we’ll get a
free round of practice on the cham-
pionship course. That should help.”

The Generals, 344, have defeated
every team in the ODAC at least
once this season, and Leslie is taking
the realist's approach to the tourna-
ment. “We've been a fortunate team
this year in that when one player has
an off round, there has been someone
else there to pick him up. That has
been a big key for us.

“In the ODAC, Lynchburg, Roa-
noke and Bridgewater all have better
than average shots at the title, but so
do we. We can win it or we can lose
it. Whoever has the hot hand on
those two days will come away with
the title,” said Leslie.

Ingersoll also had a big week for
the Generals. In the win against R-
MC to close the regular season, In-
gersoll made 19 saves. Conkling also
came up big against the Yellow Jack-
ets, scoring two goals and handing
out an assist as W&L jumped out to
a 9-1 halftime lead en route to the
10-5 win.

Bishop now has 41 for the season.
Wert has 26 and Dowling has 21.
Said Hathom, “Early in the season,
Kimberly set the pace for us the way
she scored, but now everyone is
starting to catch up with her. We had
games where six or more people have
scored.

“I'm pleased with the way every-
one has been playing lately," said
Hathom. “Over the past week, Me-
linda [Conkling], [freshman] Ginny
Dallum and [freshman] Lisa Jennings
have played well. Their speed is a
big asset, being able to run with
people. Kimberly [Bishop] and Shawn
Wert have really helped with their
scoring, and Erica [Ingersoll] has
been terriﬁc in goal.”

The Generals, 10-6 on the season,
will meet Lynchburg Friday in the
semiﬁnals. W&L defeated LC 6-3
earlier in the season.

“We all thought we deserved to
be in the ﬁnal four, and now we’re
there,” said Hathom. “We feel all
the pressure is on Lynchburg because
they weren’t supposed to lose to us
the first time. They have to redeem
themselves. It should be a tough
game, but we'll be ready.”

Optimism high despite loss

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

The last time the Washington and
Lee men’s lacrosse team finished the
season with a winning record was
1987, when the»Generals ﬁnished 11-
4. That team reached the NCAA
Division III Final Four.

The 1990 version of the Generals
will no doubt finish the season with
a winning record, but that may not be
good enough to qualify for the
NCAA Tournament.

But fust year head coach Jim
Stagnitta thinks otherwise despite a

 

Jlm Stagnitta

...7-4 in first year

12-4 loss to second-ranked Washing-
ton College. “If we can win our last
two games and ﬁnish 9-4, we should
be in the Top 10, and that will merit
serious consideration for a bid. We
have two big wins over highly ranked
teams, and there are teams in the Top
10 now who have no big wins. That
will deﬁnitely work in our favor.”

Going into Saturday's game, the
Generals were ranked No. 11 in the
nation and riding a four-game winn-
ing streak, including two wins in
overtime over teams ranked at the
time.

Washington College wasted little
time in showing that it deserved its
No. 2 ranking. Said Stagnitta, “We
didn't play a real strong ﬁrst quarter,
and that coupled with the fact that
they are bigger, stronger and faster

really did us in. On the whole, our
defense played well, but when you
have three of your top players not
play their best game, you won't beat
the No. 2 team in the nation.”

Junior Tom Costello came up big
time and time again in goal for
W&L, but the Generals could not
muster a rally against WC. Costello
made a career high 24 saves but may
not have been the best goalie on the
ﬁeld. Said Stagnitta, “When we were
able to get shots, their goalie [Dave
Slomkowski} just plain stuffed us. He
may be the best goalie in the
nation."

Senior attackrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni was held to one goal. The
loss was W&L’s ﬁrst at home this
season. The Generals are now 4-1 on
Wilson Field.

During the streak, Mastrogiovanni
put up some impressive numbers.
Said Stagnitta, “As Mastro goes, so
goes the team. When he is scoring it
means two things — our transition is
working and he is finishing the play
and that our midﬁeld is playing well
and getting him the ball.”

Against Gettysburg on March 24
in the rain and snow on Wilson
Field, he scored ﬁve goals, including
his team's last three. The ﬁfth was
the garne-wirmer in the second over-
time off a feed from junior midﬁelder

Todd Garliss.

Garliss also had two goals and
two assists as the Generals topped
then sixth-rariked Gettysburg 8-7.

“The Gettysburg game really
turned our season around,” said
Stagnitta. “We were coming off two
tough losses, and to beat a team as
good as Gettysburg after falling be-
hind is a credit to us. They tied the
game with three seconds left, and that
gave them momentum, but we hung
tough and Mastro pulled it out.”

On March 28, also at home, the
Generals held off Middlebury College
as Mastrogiovanni led the way with
ﬁve goals and one assist. Said Stag-
nitta, “We were pretty banged up,
but we were able to hold them off
late and win the game."

On March 31 the Generals played
their ﬁnal road game on the year at
Guilford in another Top 20 clash.
Guilford was ranked twelfth coming
into the game.

“We fell behind late in the
game,” said Stagnitta. “We chipped
away, and for the ﬁrst time, they
guys got the feeling that they would
come back and win. It was the first
time in a while that the guys played
conﬁdent from behind.”

Trailing 12-11, Mastrogiovanni fed
sophomore Jeff Roberts from behind
the goal for Roberts’ third goal of the
day with 58 seconds left to tie the
game at 12 and force an extra period.

Sophomore Wiemi Douoguih beat
his man out front and then beat the
goalie from ﬁfteen yards out just 22
seconds in giving W&L a 13-12 win.

The fourth came when the Gen-
erals entertained Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference foe Virginia Wes-
leyan. The Generals raced out to a
19-0 goal before Virginia Wesleyan
got on the board.

Mastrogiovanni scored the ﬁrst
four goals of the game in a span of
4:07 in the opening quarter. He ﬁn-
ished with six goals on the day.
Freshman Rhett Hancock scored ﬁve
second half goals, and ﬁve other
Generals scored two or more goals in
the 25-1 win.

The Generals, 7-4, 2-2 in ODAC
play, will ﬁnish out the season with
two home games, Sunday against
Hampden-Sydney and on May 5 with
the Lee-Jackson Classic against VMI.

Track looking
to regain title

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee men’s
track team finished tuning up for this
weekend's Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships by compet-
ing at the Catholic Invitational last
weekend in the Washington D.C.
rain.

Head coach Norris Aldridge was
pleased with his team's performance
considering the inclement weather.
“We ran pretty well considering the
weather,“ said Aldridge.

Winning performances included
the 4x100 meter relay team of seniors
Wes Boyd, Tie Sosnowski, Scott
Williams, and junior Carl Gilbert.
The only other winner was senior
Phillip Sampson who pole vaulted to
thirteen feet and six inches to claim
the crown.

Besides his strong contribution in
the 4x100 meter relay, Boyd grabbed
a third place in the 100 meters and a
fourth in the 200 meters. Williams
also contributed fourth place ﬁnishes

in the discus and the 400 meter run.

Aldridge feels the ODAC crown
is attainable but that everyone will
need to turn in fine performances and
is not looking for any one person or
group to lift the Generals.

Heading into this weekend, the
injuries are nearly all healed. Only
the Generals’ two top hurdlers remain
hurt. Freshman David Phillips may
try to overcome his hamstring prob-
lem and run the intermediate hurdles
this weekend. Sophomore David
Harper will deﬁnitely not run again
this season.

The Generals will try to add the
ODAC outdoor crown to the indoor
one they attained last winter. It would
be Aldridge's third crown in four
years. The meet begins at 10:00 am.
on Wilson Field.

Individually, despite of how he
ﬁnishes in the outdoor championships,
Gilbert has already earned a return
trip to the NCAA meet. The 1990
ODAC Indoor Track Athlete-of-the-
Year qualiﬁed for the triple jump in
outdoor competition as well.

The Fling-tum Phl, April 26, 1990

Medinica, a Birmingham, Alabama
sculptor, who will try to restore the
wooden statue, which has apparently
suffered from the elements, wood-
peckers, bugs, and a surplus of atten-
tion since it was placed on the cupola
of Washington Hall in 1844. Over the
years Old George, highly visible on

"The Hill," has been spiritedly deco- .

rated, painted, and unfortunately
abused on various occasions.

In the early 1900s a popular year-
ly event was the college boat races
on the old North River, for which all
of Lexington was decorated, including
Old George, who received daily coats
of paint for weeks. Virginia Military
Institute cadets have also gotten in on
the act, at times succeeding in paint-
ing him their school colors, red and
yellow. It is claimed that these hun-
dreds of coats of paint are responsi-
ble for Old George's preservation and
his 156 year—old reign over the cam-
pus.
On a sadder note, Old George has
also been tarred and feathered several
times.

Old George has also been used by
some to demonstrate particular opin-
ions. Soon- after co-education was
announced, George sported a banner
that said "No Marthas."

Recently the Cadaver Society, a
secret group of university benefactors,
gave George a society banner to
display. Someone also climbed atop
Washington Hall a few weeks ago
and left a VMI cap, a cape, and a
cardboard sign that read "Must Ev-
erything Change?"

The 8—foot statue weighing 700-
pounds, was originally carved as a
hobby by local carpenter Matthew
Kahle in 1840,‘ from a pine log he

found drifting down the James River.
It depicts George Washington stand-
ing in a toga, holding a sword and a
scroll, which symbolize his twin
callings as a scholar and a statesman.

Because it is painted a gleaming
white, the statue is frequently thought
to be made of marble. According to
legend the University paid Kahle
$100 for Old George and actually
planned to replace Old George with a
marble likeness in later years.

Shaw said that the estimated
$100,000 needed to restore Old
George would be contributed by
W&L’s Class of 1940, which
includes Sidney Lewis, for whom
Lewis Hall is named, and John Wam-
er, which the Warner Center is
named after.

The old Old George who has
looked serenely on the glories and
sorrows of Lexington and the Shenan-
doah Valley will be restored by
Medenica in his Alabama studio and
then sent to Florida, where he will be
used as a mold for a bronze replica,
which will be painted white and
placed atop Washington Hall. The
new and improved Old George will
receive a place of honor inside a
school building. Shaw cited the Len-
fest Center as a possible location.

The task to restore Old George
may take more than a year, according
to Shaw, because "He had deterio-
rated more than anyone had realized."

Shaw said that Medenica was
also surprised at the condition of Old
George. Several weeks ago when
Medenica went up on the Washington
Hall roof to look at the statue, he
noticed it swayed dangerously on its
perch when touched. He also thought
it had hollow spots inside.

damage to Old George, the wooden statue of George Washington that
was removed from the main building on campus. W&L photo by W.

Patrick Hinely.

The statue went to pieces when it
was removed, losing its base, its,
feet, and half of its right leg.

Despite his present condition, Old
George has been a trooper throughout
his years of watch over the communi-
ty. He has only been restored two
other times, once in 1936, when he
was removed, and in the 1960s when
he was repaired on the rooftop.

In 1864, during the Civil War, he
is said to have saved the university,
then named Washington College,
from destruction by Union forces.
Union Colonel David Hunter had just
finished shelling VMI, which was
almost completely destroyed, and was
turning his guns toward Washington

College when Captain Henry A.
DuPont told him about Old George.
Hunter refrained from attacking the
likeness of George Washington and
moved on down the valley.

One question remains un-
answered. Until our sacred Old
George is replaced, who will keep
vigil over Lexington? Shaw said
"We'll just have to depend on the
statues of Cyrus McCormick and
Stonewall Jackson."

Executive Committee President
Willard Dumas expressed his hope
that "At least George will be up for
my graduation in 1991." As an after-
thought Dumas added "Knock on
wood." Pardon the pun George.

Lee Hi Truck Stop: a solid ‘A’

Where else can college students and truckers mingle?

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

Warning: this review is not a
spin—off from the April Fool’s Day
edition of the Phi. Please do not
immediately dismiss it as utter gar-
bage, although by the end of the
article you can draw your own con-
clusions about my sanity. In this
review I will offer my opinions and
criticisms of a Lexington eating es-
tablishment: Lee Hi Truck Stop and
Restaurant.

A review of Lee Hi Truck Stop??
Eyebrows are immediately raised, and
alumni once again write nasty letters
concerning my writing. Why did I
select Lee Hi instead of the elegant
Wilson Walker House? Or the
charmingly rustic Maple Hall? Sim-
pie: during spring term students are
too busy sunbathirig, hiking, and
sleeping (oh yeah, they attend a few
classes) to eat regular meals. Wash-
ington and Lee students require a
place where good food, and an
unique atmosphere, are available
twenty-four hours a day. And Lee
Hi’s restaurant fits that order perfect-
ly.

If you love breakfast food at any
time of the day or night, and your
checking account is dying a fast
death, then Lee Hi is the perfect stop.
I ate at Lee Hi about six times dur-
ing winter semester, but never before
eleven o’clock at night. The circum-
stances are always the same: it’s late,
you’re tired of studying for a test,
(this term substitute sunbathing)
you’re hungry, and the idea of anoth-
er Domino’s pizza is unbearable. So
you call two of your friends, per-
suade them that a study break is in
order, and jump in the car. After a
two-mile drive up Highway 11 North,
you’ll begin to hear the rumble of
semis and smell the diesel fuel.
You’re at Lee Hi.

The breakfast menu is available
any time day or night, and it offers
good food at shockingly low prices.
But if you go to Lee Hi with a crav-
ing for breakfast food, then you must
order their hotcakes. (Don't ask for
pancakes, its a breach of etiquette
and four burly truckers will escort
you out of the restaurant) For only
a $1.75 one receives two gigantic
hotcakes and enough maple syrup to
drown any spring term blues. The
hotcakes are hot, ﬂuffy, and tasty.
Are you saying that hotcakes are not

enough? Then you can order two
hotcakes with sausage for only $2.60,
or two hotcakes with two eggs (any
style) for a mere $2.55. We’re talk-
ing pre—Carter Administration prices!

If you haven’t eaten in days, then
Lee Hi has a breakfast special that
will feed a family of six: “The He-
Man Special.” For $4.70 the follow-
ing mind-boggling combination ar-
rives at the table: two eggs, two
slices of bacon, a hamburger steak,
home fries, biscuits or toast, and
jelly. You can wash all that choles-
terol down with Lee Hi’s “bottomless
cup” of coffee for an extra 50 cents.

I am the hotcake fanatic, but one
of my suitemates also swears by Lee
Hi’s homemade sausage biscuits.
For $1.25 he gets one plain biscuit
with honey, butter and jelly, and one
sausage biscuit. I’ll have to admit
that the biscuits almost rival the
hotcakes. They are also served hot
and fresh. But these are only a few
of the low-priced breakfast entries
one can get. The list also includes
omelettes, hashbrowns, oatmeal,
corned beef hash, and, of course,
grits.. Reminds me of the spreads
Grandma use to put out on Sunday
morning.

I’ll admit that my attention has
not wavered past the breakfast menu,
but Lee Hi does offer a large selec-
tion of dishes with such names as
“Lean and Low” (for the trucker
who is watching his waistline) and
“The Fishennen's Net.” And for
those of you who not only miss
Grandma's breakfasts, but also her
dimers, Lee Hi serves up liver and
onions for a mere $4.05. I haven’t
been brave enough to order this par-
ticular dish.

The service is fast considering the
food was not prepared earlier in the
day, and I promise that your coffee
cup will not be empty for long. The
waitresses themselves are very effi-
cient and a bit grumpy, although in
all fairness who wants to wait tables
at midnight?

Also, if you're sick of the “Our
Gang” motif at a certain local restau-
rant, Lee Hi offers the other extreme:
fans hang from the ceilings, pictures
of fox hunting and Civil War gener-
als adorn the walls. In the back-
ground Hank Williams blares from
the mandatory jukebox. It made me
homesick for my homestate of Ne-
braska.

The tables are bright red formica
with hard woodchairs. and the ketch-
