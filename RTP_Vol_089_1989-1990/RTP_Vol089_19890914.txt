Live Drive, an organization on
‘campus dedicated to eradicating
1 drunk driving, will be available for

Washington and Lee ~students again‘

./ ‘this year.

Live Drive was established in the
Fall of 1988 by a group of students
‘who were concerned with providing
' safe rides to and from parties in
. order to avoid any accidents caused

‘ by intoxicated drivers.

' The 1989-90 Live Drive
leadership includes junior John
9. Fialcowitz; junior Amy Sapp,
director of publicity; juniors

4 Christopher Bray and Tim Clarke,
1 scheduling overseers; junior Amy
Aussiker, treasurer; and sophomore,
‘' Stephen Mathis, secretary.
This year the group is expecting
an even more effective operation of
Q Live Drive. The Live Drive vans
will not only ride upon the request
of different fraternities, but also will
1~ be in service every weekend with at
least one van on call. John
Fialcowitz urges anyone who needs
ca ride to a party who has been
drinking or who is riding with an
intoxicated person to call Room 204
1 of the University Center at 463-
8947 from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays
and Saturdays.

presentation tonight in Northen
Auditorium. All members of the
W&L student body, faculty and

staff are urged to attend and fill out
sorority evaluations to assist the
Panhellenic Council.

The Council,
members from the
W&L sororities —— Chi Omega,
Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa
Kappa Gamma — decided this past
spring that the addition of a fourth
sorority was necessary to
accommodate the demand by W&L
women for sororities.

“Ideally we’d like members of
each sorority to number no more
than seventy-five. We want the

composed of
three existing

system to remain inclusive so every
woman who wants to be a part of
sororities at W&L has that chance.
It is necessary to add another group
in order to respond to demand,”
said Wendy Wilson, panhellenic

publicity, housing and extension
chairwoman.

The Sorority Advisory
Committee decided last year to

allow three sororities to colonize at
W&L after questionnaires showed
only 120 women indicating interest

in sororities. Over 250 women
pledged in January.

sororities, the extension committee

Money error haunts SAB

By Richard Peltz
Staff Reporter

The financial activities of Washington and Lee's

‘Student Activities Board will be carefully recorded and

monitored this year as the organization tries to recover
from a debt of more than $19,000.

According to David Grove, 1988-1989 SAB
chairman, "miscomrnunication" between former SAB
Treasurer Mike Carroll and last year's Fancy Dress
Chairwoman, Liz Smith, contributed to a debt of
$14,000 by early May, The Ring-tum Phi reported last
spring. This week, the SAB’s 1989-90 treasurer,
Kathleen Duwel, said the total debt was actually close
to $20,000.

And, while she said careful budgeting and an eye
on spending will allow the impact of last year's debt to
go virtually unnoticed by students, Duwel admitted that
the SAB’s new officers have inherited a series of
headaches along with the money troubles.

“We’re having a hard time coping with last year's
bills," she said. “They're still coming in.”

The Executive Committee, which supervises the
SAB and the use of student activities fees, paid last
year's debts and a number of bills received during the
summer with money from its reserve fund, Duwel said.
At the end of the 1988-89 school year, when the EC
closed the accounts of other organizations it sponsors,
all positive balances were put toward that fund. But EC
President Willard Dumas said that, despite that
concentration of resources, the SAB debt “has depleted
most of our student reserves." 1

Duwel said that a laissez-faire approach to SAB
spending last year caused the financial trouble. Charges
to the SAB’s business office account were
unnecessarily frequent and often were not recorded by
the treasurer, according to Duwel. .

“The attitude before this year was, ‘It’s‘not our
money,’ ” said Duwel. “My biggest goal is to stay on
top of where every single penny is."

Dumas said he has confidence in the new SAB
management. “The SAB is still going to have
autonomy in their activities," he said. “We've
appointed more people to act as watchdogs in the
SAB.” v

Christopher deMovellan, 1988-89 EC President, last
May told current SAB Chairman Charles Conklin to
dismiss SAB members who failed to perform their
duties, and Conklin said he intends to do just that.

“We're here to have a good time, but we’ve got a
duty and responsibility to the students,” \he said.
“Anyone who can't perform [his job] needs to step
aside for someone who can.” \

SAB officers have been fulﬁlling their duties for
some time already. In addition tomthe usual roster of

   Reserve funds depleted by debt

rock groups, SAB leaders said they hope to sponsor a
diversity of performers this year. Upcoming
entertainment in the General Headquarters will include
a piano player on Sept. 20 and a reggae band on Oct.
18, according to _ Michael Applebaum, SAB
entertainment director. He said an illusionist will
perform in the pavilion on Oct. 13, and the SAB will
repeat last year's bingo night at least once this fall, he
said. .

The SAB will present its 1989-90 budget to the EC
in October. Monday night the EC unanimously
approved to freeze SAB funds until further notice.

SAB reaches
to law school:

new job made

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

Because the Student Activities Board has failed to
adequately advertise events to law students in the past,
the Executive Committee created new a position, that
of Publicity Director for the law school, at its meeting
Monday night.

Previously, said EC President Willard Dumas, there
has been only one SAB Publicity Chairman whose
responsibilities included advertising of student events
for both the undergraduate and law school campuses.

“It‘s been the history of the P SAB, never
intentionally, to tend to be centered on the
undergraduate campus,” Dumas said. “The law school
has ban often ignored by the SAB."

This year, Dumas said, the SAB failed to advertise
at the law school for last Friday‘: concert by the Truly
Dangerous Swamp Band at the Student Pavilion.

The EC will be accepting applications for ‘the
position in two weeks. This year, only law students
will be considered for the job, Dumas said.

“We felt the situation was so urgent that a law
school student was necessary for the job this year,"
Dumas said.

In subsequent years, undergraduates may be
considered for the position, Dumas said.

"With a publicity director for only the law school,
hopefully SAB functions will be better advertised."
said Dumas.

Beard says no noise isgood noise

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

No fraternities received noise
violations this past weekend,
although several houses failed to
obtain noise permits, said Associate
Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy” Atkins at the
Interfratemity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

Atkins attributed the lapses to
house officers’ not understanding
the new, more complicated rules for
obtaining noise permits.

This year, fraternities must
register their parties with the Dean
of Students office before they can
receive a noise permit from the
police department.

Atkins said from now on, houses
must be sure to register their parties
at the risk of receiving a rush
violation. This year, a house will
not be able to obtain a noise permit
for one week if it receives a noise

violation.
Atkins said each house should
expect to have band parties

scheduled for this Saturday night to
be shut down by 12:30 a.m. ‘

In addition, the Lexington Police
were called to Natural Bridge to
respond to an emergency call for
the shooting that occurred there
Saturday night (see other story).

However, Lexington Police Chief
Bruce Board said the incident did
not affect the department’s
enlbrcrsmerit of the noise regulations.

“All of our patrolmen were back
from Natural Bridge and back on
patrol by 11:30,” said Beard. “We
don't usually have to shut any
parties down before midnight.”

Beard credited W&L students
with being cooperative with the
police’s efforts Saturday night.

“I was very pleased with the
reception my officers got at each
house,” Beard said. “The students
were very. cooperative the whole
night.”

In other business, IFC President
Kevin Nash armounced each house
must turn in its preference list by 3
p.m. Thursday. The lists of rushees
for rush dates, which begin Sunday
evening, will be released Sunday

OPINION

The hammer falls
on the Phi Delts

The brothers of Phi Delta Theta have had a rough
summer. As we reported last week, Phi Delt’s W&L
chapter has been put on probation by the university for
leaving its fraternity house in what the chapter’s
adviser, Prof. Joseph Goldsten, and W&L’s dean of
fraternity affairs, Buddy Atkins, agreed was “unaccept-
able” condition.

Perhaps because so much has been made of W&L’s
Fraternity Renaissance, the noise of Dean Atkins’ ham-
mer falling on 5 Henry St. could be heard across the
campus. Among other things, according to a letter from
Atkins to Phi Delt President -Warren Holland, the
probation Atkins imposed limits the number of Phi Delt
pledges to 15, bans weeknight parties, limits the Phi
Delts to only four parties per month and only two per
month in the Phi Delt house, and demands that the Phi
Delt grade-point average rise at least one place per
term in the rankings of fraternities.

We understand Atkins’ frustration. The university has
put money and its reputation on the line by saying that
the fraternity system is worth saving. The W&L Board
of Trustees has stood up to those members of the
faculty who would be thrilled to see the fraternity
system go under, and the condition of the Phi Delt
house last May gave fraternity critics a spectacular
opportunity to scream, “We told you so!” Atkins had
no choice but to act swiftly and harshly.

neccessary, we agree with Holland that some aspects of
the probation are unfair. , ,

Specifically, we object to the insistence that Phi Delt
raise its house GPA in relation to those of other
houses. If Dean Atkins had said the Phi Delt GPA must
rise one-tenth, or even two-tenths, of a grade point, we
could see the reasoning and perhaps applaud him. But
instead, he wants the Phi Delts to jump over at least
one other house per term. No matter how much work
the Phi Delts do, even if they live in the library, they
cannot control the grades of other houses. And, under
these rules, it will be to the advantage of the Phi Delts
if other houses’ grades drop. The Hill should not be in
the business of promoting cut-throat grade wars.

And there is another problem with this probation: the
limit on pledges. Atkins told our reporter he doesn’t
know how the Phi Delts will handle that one, and we
don’t either. Should the Phi Delts give out only 15
bids? Should they give out 25 and hope only 15 are
accepted? Should they give out as many as they want
and then, a few days later, tell a collection of
freshmen, W&L men who were high school seniors
when the damage occured, “Sorry, just kidding?” If
the Phi Delts do rescind bids, who gets to stay and
who doesn’t? Atkins said the answers are up to the Phi
Delts, but it seems he has left them in a nearly
impossible situation.

Finally there is the question of guilt. We have no
reason to doubt reports from Atkins that the house was
“just generally trashed,” but we wonder if the right
people are being punished. Holland said most — if not
all — of the damage to the house was caused by some
of last year’s Phi Delt seniors. “I don’t think anybody
in this house now had anything to do with that,” he
said.

Even if Holland is mistaken, even if some of the Phi
Delts who have returned were involved in damaging
their chapter home, we believe Holland when he says
last year’s seniors were primarily responsible for the
rampage. We are left wondering if Atkins, perhaps
because the guilty are beyond his reach, has decided to,
go after those he can get his hands on instead.

We agree with Atkins that the Hill “must” make it
clear that this is not the thing to do, that this is
forbidden.” But we are not so sure that “there is an
attitude that exists in the house that this is the thing to
do.” Even though acts of vandalism in the past may
indicate the potential for acts of vandalism in‘ the
future, we think Atkins has, by so severly punishing the

Phi Delts of today and tomorrow, gone too far.

But the public-relations problems the Renaissance 
faces should not take a front seat to due process and .
fairness. While a punishment of some sort was certainly ‘

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

It used to be that everyone spoke
the same language and things were
simple and organized such that a Vi-
king crusader invading another coun-
try would have no problem ﬁnding
bathrooms and reading menus. And
then for some stupid reason (no one
knows why) the human species de-
cided to invent foreign languages.
Notice that I say the human species.
Animals of the same species always
speak the same language. If my dog
Brutus and I, for example. were trav-
elling in Switzerland and I met a
Swiss-Gerrnan named Frotag also ac-
companied by a dog, Frotag and I
could only stare blankly at each other
while Brutus and Frotag's dog would
be able to hold a colorful conversa-
tion using the barks and growls com-
mon to all dogs.

What I’m trying to say is that
countless difficulties could be

avoided if people who don't speak
the same language would only com-

  

municate using a universal system of
barks and growls. Of course, I'm on-
ly joking. This would never work;
we'd never be able to agree on a
universal bark-growl scheme. There-
fore. the only option remaining be-
sides actually learning a foreign lan-
guage is to avoid foreigners unless
they happen to be Fmglish-speaking

' foreigners.

Avoiding foreign language speak-
ing foreigners was easy until my sis-
ter decided to marry a French Mor-
occan. I soon found myself in North
Africa for a wedding ceremony
spending long weeks with _people
who could speak only French and/or
Arabic. Out of the thirty Americans,
French and Moroccan people normal-
ly eating dinner at Karim's (my
brother-in-law), house only two peo-
ple were fully bilingual. Karim and
his brother I-Iishem (no, I'm not
making these names up). Having
Karim or Hishem there to translate
made it possible for everyone to
communicate. Unfortunately, Karim
and Hishem also grew so weary of
continuous translating that they began
to play the kind of translator tricks

that start World Wars when they're
pulled off at the United Nations:

My family (in English): "Karim,
tell your Mother that dinner was
wonderful."

Karim (translating in French):
"Mom, the Americans say dinner
tasted like generic dog food and that
they would give up vital organs right
now for a Wendy's chicken
sandwich.”

Since I obviously couldn't rely on
Karim and his brother to do a good
job of translating I was forced to
devise an alternate technique. Since
my technique is quick, easy and does
not involve any type of thinking I
recommend it to anyone who might
be considering taking French classes
which are difficult and boring. The
ftrst‘step in my “Get by but know
nothmg" plan is based on the old
adage "say unto others as you would
have them sayunto you." Let's face
it, when people talk they spend a lot
of time repeating each other; there-
f0Y6. when you're talking to a
foreigner it's a good idea to simply
repeat anything they tell you. A con-

versation between me and one of my

French relatives will serve to exhibit
this point.

French relative (in French):
"Your head is shaped like a banana
bike seat."

Me (not understanding a word but
repeating in French): ”Your head is
shaped like a banana bike seat.”

The second and final step of my
“Get by but know nothing" plan is
the simple repetition of the word
“Bon" with any word which comes
to mind after it. Step two should be
used when someone tells you some- \
thing in French that is too long to
repeat. For example:

"Bon Jour" (good morning)

"Bon Voyage" (good trip)

"Bon Scott" (A musician from the
hard rock band AC-DC who
overdosed on some industrial strength
drug like Lemon Scented Tide.)

Remember, my two—step commu-
nicating-in-foreign languages
technique should only be used as a
last resort. If it is not already too
late, I would recommend that readers
with sisters force them to become
nuns or introduce them to Midwest-
emers named “Bob."

The PhiDelts

object to story
on probation

We are writing this letter in response to the
story headlined “Phi Delt hit with probation,”
which appeared on the first page of last week's
edition of The Ring-tum Phi. While we do not
deny that extensive damage was done to our
chapter house at the end of the 1988-89 school
year, we feel that we were unjustly treated
when the conditions of our probation were
made public last week by Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins.

We accept full responsibility for the wanton
destruction perpetrated by a few of our now-
graduated members last spring, and obviously
we also accept conditions of our probationary
status, but we feel that Dean Atkins had
neither the duty nor the right to disclose the
conditions of our probation to the public. It
seems that he was only kicking us while we
were down when he passed on a copy of his
letter outlining our probation and addressed
only to Warren Holland, president of Phi Delta
Theta, to a news-hungry Ring-turn Phi reporter.

Furthermore, Dean Atkins’ comment that
“Clearly there is an attitude that exists on the
house that this (breaking windows, etc.) is the
thing" to do," was both inaccurate and
urmecessary. Before the year-end damage to
the house, which was perpetrated by a few
rowdy members who graduated in '89, we had
cut our damage expenses in half over the
previous year, and we fell they were
comparable to any other house our size at
W&L. The story depicted Phi Delt as a pack
of wild party boys hell-bent on breaking mics
and destroying property, which just isn't the
case. It is a shame that the actions of a few
can lead to the painting of such a grim,
inaccurate picture. It _

It seems that Dean Atkins and/or The Ring-
tum Phi have failed to mention the numerous
accomplishments and positive aspects of our
fraternity, especially over the past three years.
Phi Delt has won the overall intramural trophy
two of the past three years, and we have
boasted leaders on various varsity athlete teams
as well. During this period, Phi Delts have
served as captains of the football and cross
country teams, and our members have stood
out on the baseball, basketball and tennis teams
as well. Two Phi Delts earned All-American
honors in tennis for the 1988 season when
W&L won the NCAA Division III national
championship. Several members have received
numerous awards and recognition in football as
well.

Phi Delt is well-represented outside of
W&L;s athletic programs, too. We have
consistently had a member serve on the
Executive Committee, and for the fourth time
in four years a Phi-Delt will co-chair the
school-wide Muscular Dystrophy Association

  

Superdance. "Phi Delts have also been very
active in Kathekon and t SAB, and are
consistently one of the largest group donors at
the carnpus-wide blood drive. A number of
our members serve as volunteer coaches for
the Rockbridge Area Recreation Organization,
and others are active in the big brother/little
brother program. One needn’t look hard to see
the strong, positive side of Phi Delt.

The events that occurred at the close of last
year were indeed unfortunate for Phi Delt, but
we are confident that we will emerge from our
probationary period stronger and more uniﬁed
than ever. In 1987, our chapter celebrated its
100th year of existence on the W&L campus,
and we intend to preserve our place here for at
least another 100 years, as we are equal to the
challenges set forth in Atkins’ edict.

Sincerely,
The Brothers of Phi Delta Theta,
Virginia Zeta Chapter

patently racist

Flipping through the senior pictures in my
Calyx, I came across a very disturbing picture
on page 131. It was a picture of Professor
Futch, surrounded by seniors. In front of them
was a racist icon: the so-called “porch
monkey.” (I am told that it is also known by
even worse names.) I did not know any of
the people in the picture. However, after
looking at the fraternity pictures, I discovered
that the majority of the seniors in the picture
were KAs and SAEs, with a few Phi Delts
thrown in.

I am not surprised that most of the seniors
in the picture were from those fraternities — I
wonder why. One would expect something
like this from a KA or an SAE; it seems that
baing racist is part of their tradition (which is
by no means to say that all of their
membership is racist.)

However, one would expect more from a
professor. But then again, considering the
extreme respect Prof. Futch has for women, it
isn't surprising that he has equally little
sensitivity for the feelings of other
“undesirables" responsible for all of society's
ills.

This past (academic) year there was a
conference held to discuss the alleged racial
insensitivity (to say the least) of various

members of KA, among others. Their
representatives tried to discount those
accusations. I wonder how the “good ole

boys” of the aforementioned fraternities intend
to explain away their latest episode of
stupidity.

So, then. let me ask: do you. (the members
of KA, SAE and Phi Delta Theta) condemn

 

such a patently racist act; or do you condone
it? Come on, this is your big chance to prove ‘
that all of you are not a bunch of rednecks.

This Yankee liberal hopes to be hearin’
from y'all in the next Phi.

Sincerely,
Gary Hugh Green, H, '91

P.S. I was going to write a nasty letter, but I
thought it below me.

Editor's Note: According to Prof. Futch, the
photograph was taken at a student's home, and
he was not responsible for its staging.

Dan McDowell
remembered:
‘I miss you’

I read the article on Dan McDowell’s death
in last week's Ring-tum Phi while swallowing
back tears. I must say that despite doubts, I
agree that the decision to run a front-page
article was for the best. Unfortunately, when
such a tragedy strikes our campus, it merits, if
not demands, such coverage. I do empathize
with the editors and their decision.

However, though the news was not new to
me, I nonetheless found myself searching for
something more. I wanted, as was written in
the editorial section, to read about “the name
behind the face." I wanted to read about the
Daniel that I knew. I wanted others to hear
what a wonderful person he was, to shed light
on his life at W&L, if nothing else.

Daniel lived to ski, and Europe was his
ultimate fantasy. He danced with the case of
Fred Astaire and thought that plaid and paisley
maid an interesting match. He loved good
wine, hated bad wine, and knew the difference.
He thought everyone should know history, see
foreign films, and leam a foreign language —
French and German were his favorites. Six was
the perfect number of children, Fisher Price
toys being a must. Halloween was great, but
black jelly beans should stay in the store. The
Ski Club, Outing Club, Film Society, Voting
Regulations Board and Glee Club all knew of
Dan's talents; the peer counselors were going
to learn. The Foreign Service was his long-‘
term goal. Dan loved life, loved his friends
and, most importantly, loved his family. He
believed in living in the present, not casting a
shadow back to the past or an extended hand
toward the future. Each moment he lived was
his own.

Though words can't relieve shock and can't_
ease pain, they can tell you about the fun-lov-
ing, sensitive, talented Daniel whose last years
were spent at W&L. I miss you Dan; we all
miss you. Thanks for what you gave us.

Nancy L. Hickam, ‘90

and Lee graduates, W. Patrick
Hinely, '73, and Charles W. Mason,
'84, will be on exhibit in duPont
Gallery on the Washington and Lee
campus Sept. 18 — Oct. 8. Approxi-
mately 25 works by each photogra-
pher will be exhibited. ,

A reception honoring the two
photographers will ‘be held“‘Monday,
Sept. 25, at 8 p.m. in duPont Gal-
lery. The public is invited to attend.

Hinely, W&L's university photo-
grapher, is also a freelancer. He will
be exhibiting photographs from his
“Work/Play" series of jazz musi-
cians, a project begun in 1974. Ac-
cording to Hinely, the “Work/Play"
series depicts musicians “in situa-
tions ranging from the heat of the
moment in performance to the com-
fort of their own homes.”

Prior to becoming the university’s
chief photographer, Hinely was in-
structor at Flagler College. He
served as a staff photographer for the
Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston,
S.C. from 1977-86, and worked as a
jazz and new music program produc-
er for WJCT-FM, the NPR affiliate
in Jacksonville, Fla., from 1978-80.
His works have been exhibited in
galleries in a number of cities in the

His works have appeared on re-
cord album jackets and liner notes
for various companies in the US,
Germany and Japan, and in numerous
jazz magazines.

Mason, a Lexington native, is
photo editor for the Fairbanks (Alas-
ka) Daily News-Miner and a photog-
rapher for Black Star publications in
New York. He has worked for Fair-
banks paper since’ 1984, as staff and
chief photographer, prior to becoming
photo editor. He also worked as as-
sociate university photographer for
Washington and Lee and as a string-
er for the Roanoke Times and World-
News and the Lexington News-
Gazette.

Mason has also done a variety of
freelance photojournalism for newspa-
pers and magazines, product photog-
raphy for catalogs, and public rela-
tions photography. His personal
work includes documentary portrai-
ture, street photography and large
format landscape work.

Mason holds a master's degree in
documentary photography from Illi-
nois State University. His awards
include the Oskar Bamack Award, a
Nature Series at World Press Photo
award and NPPA National awards.

A large variety of these works
will be on display in duPont Gallery,

many of which were taken in Alaska,
Hawaii, Holland, as well as Lexing

Soviets join student body

By Scott Sanders

_ Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee is again
host to three exchange students from
the Soviet Union.

Maxim Gan and Inna
Vodovozova, both from Moscow,
and Dmitry Dobograev, from the
Byelorussian capital of Minsk,
arrived in the U.S. about a month
ago after months and stacks of
paperwork and examinations, and
after, quite literally, only a few days
notice of their acceptance by the
exchange program.

Maxim, Inna, and Dmitry are
among 58 Russian students studying
in American colleges and
universities through the American
Collegiate Consortium for East-West
Cultural and Academic Exchange.
This consortium is based at
Middlemury College, where the
students went through a 10 day
orientation period before travelling

to the campus that had been
selected for them.
In Lexington, the three new

students were greeted. assisted and

housed by Ancce McCloud, dean for
minority students and international
affairs. In the short time that they
have been here, Maxim, Inna and
Dmitry have slowly been adjusting
to their new environment and
getting into the swing of W&L life,
doing such things as playing
raquetball for the first time, hanging
out at the International House, and
going to fraternity parties. All three
said they appreciate the chance to
choose their own classes. In most of

the Russian universities, each
student decides upon his
specialization upon entering the

university and then follows a set
curriculum for the specific
specialization, they said. Changing
specializations normally involves
starting a new curriculum with little
chance of class transferring.

This year, half of their courses
must be in their specialization, but
this leaves the opportunity to study
many subjects that might otherwise
be unavailable.

Maxim said he is following in
his father’s footsteps by specializing

in journalism at Moscow State
University. When Maxim was a
child, his father was stationed in
Washington, D.C., working for the
Tass News Agency, so he has
already had a great deal of exposure
to the U.S. and is happy to be back
on his own for a year. Courses in
U.S. politics will be among those
accompanying his journalism
classes, and he said he hopes to use
his reporting skills in socializing
here at W&L before looking into
other student activities.

Inna, abroad for the first time, is
studying to be a doctor at the
Second Moscow State Medical
University and will also study
English and music.

Dmitry is specializing in
international law at Byelorussian
State University with the hopes of
being a politician, a position he
realizes is becoming increasingly
important in today's Soviet Union.
Here at W&L, he ‘is studying
American government and social
psychology.

Copies can be ‘freed’ home

By Wendy Wolford
Staff Reporter

Searching for change for photo
copying machines became a thing of
the past at Washington and Lee
University this week with the intro-
duction of the new copier card sys-
tem.

“It's a convenience to students
as well as a convenience to us, ”
said University Librarian Barbara
Brown. Instead of inserting change
into the machine or signing out a
key, card holders can make copies
with no loss of time or hassle, she
said.

Although copier cards have been
used in the W&L law library for
the past two years, Brown said the
university opted for the system the
summer when the library was
searching for new copiers.

Sororities
set to rush

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Upperclassi women who did
not take part in or did not re-
ceive -bids during Washington
and Lee's sorority rush this past
January will have the opportuni-
ty to participate in informal rush
next week, said Panhellenic
President Jane Lee Joyce.

“It’s basically giving a sen-
ior woman who didn’t rush last
January, for one reason or anoth-
er, a chance for pledgeship to be
completed during the first semes-
ter of her senior year. This will
give her theopportunity to be an
active member and experience
what Greek life has to offer
women at Washington and Lee,”
said Joyce.

Eligible students, including
sophomores and juniors, are en-
couraged to sign up. Forms may
be picked up in the Dean of
Students‘ office on Friday and
are due by noon Monday.

“I do hope that all unaffiliat-
ed women will go through
rush,” said Joyce.

Women who received bids
last January but did not accept
them may not go through rush
until January, Joyce said.

  

  

C———————1

In addition to. the convenience of
the “credit card ” system, Brown
said the new machines are also bet-
ter suited to library use. They hold
more paper than the former ones
and are designed to protect book
spines, she said.

According to John Cuny, assis-
tant treasurer and controller at
W&L, the copier card is one step
further to a “cashless society” at
the university. Along with other uni-
versity employees and students,
Cuny has been studying the possi-
bility of a campus-wide credit sys-
tem. .

He said that with such a system,
students could use the same card to
purchase meals, buy books, open
doors and even operate laundry ma-

chines. After examining the copier,

card system and programs at other
schools, Cuny's committee will

make a recommendation to the uni-

versity in March.

For the moment, Cuny said the
copier card is “just one piece of the
puzzle." A convenience to the stu-

9
I

V

dents and a time saver for book- ,

keepers, he added that the copier
card will make the university rim
more efficiently.

Although most of the copy ma-
chines on campus still use change,
copiers in the Commerce School,
the University Printing Center and
the law library accept the copier
card also.

The card, which can be pur-
chased in the Business Office f r
$5, already carries $4.50 in credit,
‘said Brown. There is a $.50 charge
for use of the card. When the ma-
chines have deducted the intial
amount of credit, added values can
be purchased as needed.

W&L to reduce 6

use of styrofoam

 

From News Releases

The Washington and Lee Food
Service Department is launching a

Slow start costs
Generals at E&H

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

When the Washington and Lee
football team opens its season on
the road, it usually means bad news.
The Generals have not won a road
opener since 1969. In recent years,
the Generals had been blown out on
opening day, most recently a 41-12
loss last year to Emory and Henry.

This year, it was a different
story as the Generals took the ﬁeld
last Saturday against the Wasps of
E&H in Emory, Va. Though the

Generals came up on the short end :

ofia 36-25 win, head coach Gary
Fallon was pleased with his team's
performance.

“We saw that we were able to
move the ball and put points on the
board against a very good defensive
team. Now we've got to keep away
from any turnovers. We fumbled the
ball a couple of times in crucial
ﬁeld position."

The Generals got off to a slow
start, and three turnovers in the first
half contributed to 16 Emory and
Henry points to put the Generals in
a hole. On the Generals first
possession, senior quarterback
Phillip Sampson's option pitch to
senior fullback Russell Crosby was
mishandled, and the Wasps
recovered 6n the W&L 42.

The Wasps then took to the
ground behind an offensive line that
outweighed the Generals’ defensive
line by an average of close to 30
pounds. Running behind the right
side, anchored by John Willson (215
pounds) and B.I. Salyers (250),
tailback Scotty Verran ran six times
for 42 yards, getting the touchdown
on a one—yard run with 9:35 left in
the quarter.

After not being able to get a
ﬁrst down on the next series, the

enerals were forced to punt. Junior
Mason Pope's third career punt was
blocked by Da.nny Asher and
recovered on the W&L eight. The
Generals defense buckled, and the
Wasps were forced to settle for a
21 yard ﬁeld goal by Monty Guy.

After sophomore Jeff Kreis
returned the kickoff out to the W&L
27 yard line, the offense went to
work. Sampson and Co. abandoned
the running game for a ball—control

     

passing attack, and the Generals
went on a 12-play, 73-yard drive.
On the drive, Sampson completed
ﬁve passes, including a 33-yard
broken-play pass to senior tight—end
Bob Martin, with gave the Generals
first and goal on the Wasps’ two
yard line. Three plays later, Pope
went in from the one, and junior
Carter Quayle’s point-after made it
10-7.

Emory & Henry took the kick-
off and marched 53 yards for a
touchdown. Verran again was king
bee, scoring on a ﬁve-yard run with
11:55 left in the first half to put the
Wasps up 17-7.

After another W&L fumble,
E&H quarterback Pat (Walker found
freshman wide-out Cary Perkins
open for a 22-yard touchdown pass.
Guy’s kick was blocked, so the
Wasps led 23-7. Perkins, who had
six catches for 132 years and one
touchdown, is partially deaf.
“Perkins is a ﬁne young player and
we are going to see a lot from him

in the next three years,’ ’ said
Fallon.
The Generals were not

discouraged by the turnovers though,
and Sampson drove the Generals 48
yards, again with short passes, for a
33-yard ﬁeld goal by Quayle. Junior
flanker Craig Irons ‘caught ﬁve
passes on the drive for 39 yards.
Quayle’s kick made the score 23-10
at the half.

After Walker scored a touchdown
on the opening drive of the second
half to make it 29-10 for the
Wasps, the Generals started to cut
into the lead.

After E&H’s Guy missed a ﬁeld
goal, the Generals climbed aboard
Air-Sampson. The senior completed
all eight of his passes on an 80
yard drive, including a six-yard pass
to Irons in the comer of the end
zone for W&L’s second touchdown
of the day.

After the teams traded punts,
Buchanan capped an 83-yard drive
for the Wasps with a four-yard
touchdown run. Along the way,
Walker completed two long passes
to Perkins to keep the drive alive.
Guy’s PAT made the score 36-17,
E&H.

New names fill big shoes
in romp through Invitational

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

If you listened closely enough,
you could almost hear Jon Bon Jovi
rasping “It's all the same, only the
names will change” in the
background at Cy Twombly pool
last weekend as the young and
supposedly rebuilding Washington
and Lee water polo team opened the
1989 season.

W&L spent the weekend
crushing Lynchburg and Harnpden-
Sydney twice apiece Saturday in the
W&L Invitational.

The Generals, who lost about 75
percent of their goal scoring from
last year due to graduation, didn’t
seem to miss the old players. The
Generals were as dominant as ever,
trotting out a whole new stable of
talented players.

How dominant were they? Well,

,W&L outscored the opposition by

an average of more than 7-2 in the
first quarter, giving head coach Page
Remillard the luxury of benching
his starters in the last game.

Last ‘year's team was built on
muscle and brute strength, but these
Generals play a different type of

game, using their great team speed,
ﬁne goaltending by co-captain David
Olson, and resourcefulness to swim
their way to victory. Junior Tomas
Perez and freshman Scott Strader
combined for over 30 goals, keying
‘the offense in the four game set.

Remillard felt the Generals
beneﬁted from the chance to
perform against other schools, even
though his team was demonstratively
superior. “The tournament put the
season off to a good start. It
allowed us to experiment and
change lineups so I could get some
time for the younger players. Our
schedule complements our need to
take things one step at a time.”

However, both the coach and the
players realize that the season
begins in earnest this weekend as
the team travels to Boston for the
Northeast Varsity Invitational held at
MIT.

Don’t make the mistake of
assuming that W&L will be
swimming against a bunch of guys
with calculators and pens and
pocket protectors tucked into their
swimsuits, for they have a pre-

Brown kicks W&L
past Denison, 5-3

By John Laney
Staff Reporter

The men's soccer team, led by
senior Patrick Brown's three goals,
defeated Denison 5-3 Saturday at
Liberty Hall Field in their 1989
season opener.

It is the second straight year
that the Generals have beaten the
Big Red to open the season. Last
season, W&L won the opening-day
meeting in Granville, Ohio, 2-1 in
overtime.

Gone from last year's squad are
ﬁve senior starters, including co-
captains Mike Veliuona and All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
fullback Steve “Sid" Udicious and
leading scorer Johnny Sarber. Also
missing from the Generals’
backﬁeld is veteran Jeff Caggiano,
who is taking the season off to
concentrate on applying to medical
school.

As a result, W&L started the
game with a defensive backﬁeld
loaded with inexperience, and it
showed early on. Sophomore Jeff
Zieger got his first start at fullback,
while freshman Greg Williams
started at sweeper, and classmates
Chase Davis and Matt Hepler split
duty at stopper, and Reid Murphy,
another freshman, saw considerable
time at the other back.

The Generals got on the
scoreboard first when Patrick Brown
(the W&L career assist leader with
17) sent the ball into the upper right
comer of the net from the top of
the penalty box with just under nine
minutes gone in the first half.

The early lead was short lived,
though, as the new-look W&L
defense failed to communicate and

senior goalkeeper Jack Pringle's
defensive commands were not
executed. Two minutes after
Brown's ﬁrst goal, Denison’s

leading scorer, Jaan Douma, tied the
score after W&L’s backfield failed
to clear the ball.

The backﬁeld, anchored by
Pringle (who allowed just .667 goals
per game last year) and Williams,
regrouped and played thirteen
minutes of solid defense until they
momentarily lost their intensity and
allowed Denison’s Chris Epley to

rebound an indirect kick and arch a’
shot over Pringle's head for the Big
Red's second goal and a 2-1 lead.

With 4:09 left in the first half,
W&L knotted the score at 2-2.
After Williams cleared the ball to
Rick Silva, the senior forward
dribbled down the middle of the
ﬁeld between two Denison defenders
and dished the ball off to his left to
a wide open Brown, who one-timed
the ball into the lower right comer
of the goal.

The Generals erupted for two
quick goals to start the second half.
At the 38:24 mark, Silva dribbled
around the charging Denison goalie
and rolled the ball into the empty
net. Just over one minute later,
senior Scott Levitt passed the ball
to the right side to sophomore
David Hooker, who sent it high into
the opposite side of the net for what
proved to be the garne-winner.

With 25:45 remaining in the
contest, W&L’s lead was cut to one
after Denison’s Scott Demo caught
the Generals’ defense napping and
broke away with the ball on the
right side. Pringle came off the
goal line too far and he helplessly
watched Demo's shot roll into an
empty net.

W&L added an insurance goal
seven minutes later when Hooker
blindly headed the ball backwards
from the right comer to a somewhat
surprised Brown, who put it high
into the net from a low angle to
earn his first career hat trick.

With just over seven minutes left
to play, sophomore Lee Corbin
replaced Pringle (10 saves) in goal
and collected four saves of his own.

Head coach Rolf Piranian spoke
of the game in terms of survival.
“Big chunks of our game plan fell
apart and we played just well
enough to win,” he said, referring
to shaky defense, which at times did
not “click real well."

This weekend the Generals head
to Baltimore where they will take
on Johns Hopkins and Camegie—
Mellon. The two games will answer
some questions about the Generals’
defense. “We must make massive
improvements on defense to be in
the games this weekend,” Piranian
said.

Winning it all a ball
for W&L’s Morris

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

I’ll admit, one of the ﬁrst problems that newspaper people, espe-
cially those of us who handle the sports department, run into is
deadlines. Sometimes, deadlines don’t allow us to publish everything
that deserves publication. As assistant sports editor last year, I ran into
that problem.

At the time of the press run for the last issue of The Ring-tum Phi
last year, the men’s tennis team had just ﬁnished the team portion of
the NCAA Division III tournament, ﬁnishing ﬁfth in the nation. That,
however, was not the end of the season for the top four players:
senior John Morris, Bobby Matthews, Robert Haley and junior Bill
Meadows. Matthews and Haley have since graduated, but their accom-
plishinents in the individual portion of the tournament deserve recogni-
l.l()I‘l.

Haley and Meadows, the No. 2 doubles team for the Generals last
year, made it to the round of 16 in the doubles tournament to qualify
for Honorable Mention All-America status.

Morris and Matthews went into the tournament seeded third. The
duo lived up to their billing, and then some. The pair lost once on the
week in the team portion of the tournament, and avenged that loss on
their way to the NCAA Division IH doubles title, winning all their
matches in straight sets, including a 6-2, 6-3 win in the ﬁnals.

Morris, though, wasn’t ﬁnished on the week. The second seed in
the singles draw went into the toumament on an impressive winning
streak. The streak reached 19 matches in a row when Morris blasted
his way into the finals against Larry Gewer. Morris won the ﬁrst set,
but then proceeded to drop his ﬁrst set in the tournament to even the
match. Not discouraged, Morris got an early break in the deciding set
and held on for a 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 win and a rare NCAA double.

It was the first time that one player had swept the Division III
titles since 1982.

After claiming the singles and doubles titles, Morris and Matthews
went on the Athens, Ga. to compete in the NCAA Division I tourna-
ment. In the doubles, the pair fell in the first round to a team from
West Virginia who made it to the quarterﬁnals in two tight sets, 7-5,
6-4. The pair finished the season with a 28-5 overall record.

Morris drew a tough opponent in the singles draw, Southern
Califomia’s Eric Amend. Amend was a member of the 1988 U.S.
Olympic tennis team and won the NCAA D-I doubles title. Morris
gave Amend more than he wanted to handle, but the USC star pre-
vailed in three tough sets, to end Morris’ dream season at 26-9. It was
the first time a Division III player had won a set in the Division I
tournament.

“Last year, right after I did it, I thought it would be great if I was
graduating then,” said Morris. “But the more I think about it now,
the iriore I realize how much I’d like to do it again this year. I know
it puts more pressure on me, but I’d really like to do it again this
year.

This fall, Rolex, which sponsors the NCAA tennis circuits, named
Morris to a 23-person All-America team for the 1988 season. The
team consists of the top men and women players in the nation. The
only Division III player on the team, Morris was ﬂown up last week
to New York for a banquet honoring the team members.

Congratulations to W&L’s All-American tennis contingency, John

‘” Morris, NCAA Division III singles and doubles champion, Bobby

Matthews, NCAA Division III doubles champion, and Robert Haley
and Bill Meadows, NCAA Divsion HI Honorable Mention All-America
doubles.

As the new sports editor, it is my duty to give coverage to each
team that is as fair and as equal as possible. It is not always possible
for each team to get a full story each week. There will be times when
certain sports’ weekly results will be placed in the Sports Notebook. I
will try to be fair in the placement of teams in the Notebook. I will
try to make sure that if a team is in the Notebook one week, it will
not be the next. ‘

The Washington and Lee
women’s soccer opened their season

last year’s success.

Head coach Jan Hathom was
excited and optimistic going into the
fall women's soccer season, and
although the Generals struggled last
week, they showed signs of playing
like they did late last season.

The Generals opened their
season Thursday against Old
Dominion Athletic Conference foe
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
in Lynchburg.

W&L trailed throughout most of
the game, but came on strong in the
final ten rriinutes to clinch a season-
opening win.

Randolph-Macon scored first, 28
minutes into the game off a fast
break. W&L co-captain Sarah Allen
then tied the game with a penalty
kick just before halftime.

R-MWC pulled ahead 2-1 30
minutes into the second half, but
their second lead, like their first,
was short lived. The
offense came alive with a ﬂurry,
scoring three times in the final ten
minutes, including twice in the last
50 seconds of play to win the game.

Senior co—captain Catherine
Baillio tallied twice to put the
Generals in front, and freshman
Wendy Miles scored the ﬁnal goal
of the game with just twenty
seconds left.

On Saturday, the Generals
played their first home game of the
season against the Lady Blue
Marlins of Virginia Wesleyan. The
Marlins, a new edition to the
ODAC, scored just 30 seconds into
the game. W&L remained
undaunted, playing an aggressive
defensive game.

Va. Wesleyan led 1-0 at the
half. For W&L, junior goalie Sherri
Brown had eight saves.

The Marlins repeated their ﬁrst
half performance by scoring early in
the second half, after about forty
seconds of play had elapsed. The
Generals continued to play well, and

Generals proceeded to drive 76
yards for one of the scores, a 15-
yard pass from Sampson to Kreis.
Sampson then found Crosby open
for the two-point conversion, but
that would be the last score of the
day, as the Wasps turned back the

Generals 36-25.
“Our team came out with a lot
of conﬁdence about the rest of the

, season," said Sampson. “What we

did on offense felt good. But the
fact that we lost puts a damper on
that feeling. We can't win games
just because we played well against
Emory and Henry."

scoreboard when sophomore Ann
Shaughnessy put the ball in the goal
for the Generals off an assist_from
Allen, who restarted play with a
direct kick. The Generals were
unable to put the ball in the net
again, and were saddled with a 2-1
loss.

Sophomore Katie Seeman
replaced Brown in the goal for the
Generals in the second half, and
recorded ﬁve saves.

Despite the loss, Hathom was
pleased wih the way her
played. “We played a good game,
and although we didn't win, there

team '

were some positive things that came
out of the game. Our players are
learning how to read what is going
on in the game, which is something
that takes time.”

“This game was indicative of
the kind of games we’ll have the
rest of the season. We'll have to
play aggressively and at the level
we are playing now. I feel that right
now, we are playing at a level
above what we did last year.”

Hathom was excited about the
play of goalies Brown and Seeman.
“We got a great game from both of
our goalies, and I was also pleased
with our midﬁeld line [sophomore

at
Morgan Warner and junior’ Page
Kilian], which was my big conceml
coming into the season.” ,
W&L traveled to Liberty
University on Tuesday, where theyl
were defeated 4-0. Despite the loss, j
the Generals remained optimistic.

By R.J. Thomas

Q Auditions for “The Body
Shop,” a new musical comedy by
W&L professor Tom Ziegler, will
be held this Friday at 7 p.m. and
Saturday and Sunday at 3 p.m. in
the University Theater.

The play is about a group of
people forced into a weight loss
,.program by the company they work
for. The company is called Work-
slng Girl Cosmetics and because it is

cosmetics company they believe it
‘would look better for their employ-
ees to ’look good. It's about various
attitudes about image instead of
"what is inside the characters, Ziegler
paid. It is a musical comedy devoted
to anyone who has ever tried to
’lose weight.
 It is a musical in an aerobics
setting. “Musicals are harder to
‘write, but they’re more fun,” said

'egler, “Aerobics involve music so
it seemed natural for a musical.”
Music for the play was composed
by Marvin Salzberg, a former teach-

Er at the City College of New York. .

Choreography will be done by Gin-
er McNeese, a local dance instruc-
or.

4‘ Ziegler also has a play, titled
“Home 'Games," opening off-
Broadway in New York in October.

, There are ﬁve roles open in the
play and four can probably be ﬁlled

by students, Ziegler said. Three of
the roles, two women and one man,
are sightly overweight characters.

“It's a great chance for people who
an sing and dance but are a little
verweight,” said Zeigler. Being
verweight though isn’t necessary to
getting a part hr the play. One of

ihe roles is a sexy aerobics instruc-
tor and one is a tough, well-built,
male union leader. The toughest

part to cast, according to 1D. Marti-

The Ring-tum Phi, September 14, 1989

 

By Robert Wilson

Packages, room key, schedule,
matriculation, orientation...these
words all seem so familiar to
freshmen at the beginning of every
fall term. The experience is unique
in itself and involves emotions that
must be felt to be frilly understood.
At this point all of us at W&L have
endured ~the task of moving in.
Some look back on it with
comforting interest, remembering
that distant age of innocence. Some

recall its being a tense, difficult’

period when the world seemed so
foreign. Some remain indifferent
and don’t really remember what it
was like. However, to 424 young
men and women, this initiation into
the college world is a substantial
experience.

It seems that moving in occurs
in a series of phases that touch
different areas of life. The first
thing encountered is the physical
environment. Freshmen arrive on
campus seeing a warm, inviting
place steeped in white columns, red-
brick buildings, green commons and
smiling faces. You register, find
your room and begin setting up.
You organize your dorm room to
suit YOUR personality. You put up
posters you like, set your books on
the dresser, fill drawers with your
clothes, and play your music in the
room. You attempt, as much as
possible, to make your room your
home. Your physical environment
also includes the people around you
on your hall. It can be frustrating
when Billy “Slash and Burn”
Johnson is next door banging his
head on the wall to the beat of the
latest Anthrax album when you are
more accustomed to relaxing to Cat
Stevens. For those who have
singles, the first thought when
arriving is’ that the housing office
surely made a mistake and assigned
you to live in the janitor‘s broom
closet.

Another aspect of life the
freshman must deal with is the
social factor. There are many
different kinds of people here at
W&L. The freshman _must

,This

is particularly difficult for
freshman guys going through Rush.
There are hundreds of fraternity
brothers out there welcoming you
with a smile and a handshake.
Knowing which frat is the right one
for you is next to impossible at
first. The whole process can be so
superficial and
Unfortunately, this is the only way
it can be done with any level of
efficiency. Rush is a good thing
for freshman guys to experience as
it will create those bonds of
friendship that will last at least
through college and possibly through
an entire lifetime.

To seem smooth and “into it” is
a social status goal most freshmen
seek. To be familiar with the’ latest
lingo helps. Statements like, “That
calculus class is a real chafe!” are

commonly heard. Or to express an ‘

opinion like this, “That was a really
cheesy thing to say,” is not
unusual.

I asked an upperclassman how
he could tell I was a freshman. His
reply was, “It’s like a huge neon
sign ﬂashing ‘FRESHMAN’ above
your head. It is like an aura about
you~.”“> I felt embarassed, but I
figured it was just part of the
experience of being a freshman.

By Jennifer Barrows

Having survived my first week
as a freshman at Washington and
Lee, I am now quite prepared to
really settle into honest-to-goodness
college life and start enjoying
myself as much as possible. Gone
are the identifying narnetags that
branded us a freshmen. Instead I
find myself equipped only with my
weatherbeaten L.L. Bean backpack,
a dog—eared (and much—revised)
copy of my schedule, and $200
worth of books that Ihave not quite
figured out what to do with yet.

I finally for fed up with the
state of my dorm room and,
employing a nonchalant method of
cleaning, stashed everything either
under the bed or in one of the
spacious walk-in closets. Where

'once the room appeared to be a

national disaster site, it now looks
more like the humble home of two
freshman girls who happen to own
an overabundance of stuff.

Since Rush officially kicked off
on Saturday, freshman bonding does
not play as active a role as it did

during the days of orientation.
However, hobnobbing with the
upperclassmen seems to be a

pastime in which everyone engages
with energy. No longer do I feel
like a happy kid at summer camp as
I did at orientation meeting after
orientation meeting, alumni
barbecues, and friendly get-to-know-
your-fellow-freshmen soirees. I can
now proudly call myself an
undergraduate student of Washington
and Lee University.

As a freshman, Ihave become

clueless freshmen who inundate me
with questions about how to do
their laundry. I do not complain,
though. Knowing helpful laundry
hints reaps rewards: namely money
and dinner invitations (and not at
Evans Dining Hall, I assure you).
The second phenomena that I
have noticed among freshmen
students is their growing dependence
on Dominos pizza. Not a day (or
night) goes by without a smiling
Dominos representative's stopping

Stones hit the road
with Steel Wheels

 

By Allen Herrick
Stall’ Reporter

For the first time since 1981,
Rolling Stones fans have legitimate
reason to be excited. Obviously,
the huge North American tour that
the Stones recently embarked upon
is enough to thrill any Stones fol-
lower, but more importantly (at least
for those people who couldn't get

. tickets for the show), Steel Wheels

the new release from the band, sig-
nals the retum of the classic Stones

5 sound - a sound that has been sore-
; ly missed since 1981's Tatoo You
; album.

Steel Wheels recalls the mid—sev-

. enties style of rhythm and bluesy
 rock that the Stones are known for,
” The new album returns the group to

its old form, not the mid-eighties
drivel that disappointed fans and
band members, and eventually led to

A the group's brief break-up.

The ﬁrst single released from the
new album, “Mixed Emotion” al-
most suspiciously resembles
“Shouldn't Take It So Hard," the
lead single off of Richard's “Talk
Is Cheap” solo effort. However,
one intangible factor shapes the new

song into a vintage Stones hit: Mick
Jagger’s lyrics, voice, and inﬂuence.
The Jagger/Richards songwriting
history adds a new chapter, clearly
exempliﬁed by “Mixed Emotions.”

' The album contains vintage
Rolling Stones rock with songs like
“Sad Sad Sad" and “Hold On to
Your Hat," but the best tracks are
the mellower, richer songs like the
funky “Terrifying” and the ballad
“Slipping Away.”

Jagger and Richards still write
songs the same way, the difference
in Steel Wheels is that the instru-
mental sound is closer to the recent
Undercover album than to anything
else. Jagger's voice, though,
threatens as well as ever, retaining
its unique, classic sound.

Keith Richards sings lead vocals
on two songs, which is one song
too many. “Slipping Away,” the
last track on the disc, is a beautiful
song that perfectly completes the
album. Richard's scratchy,
wavering voice does not strain or
break the song. He is low key and
decently pitched on this ballad.

“Can’t Be Seen,” on the other
hand, chops its way through four
minutes of Richards’ hacking and

album is dragged down by this tune
and by “Hearts for Sale,” a filler
song whose only redeeming quality

The otherwise terriﬁc

is a scorching Ron Wood riff.
Even Wood cannot save this song,
however, and its blandness is further
aggravated by the occasional
glimmering effort by Wood.

Visit to Uncle Buck worth

 

By Todd Peppers
_Entertalnment Columnist

What family does not have that
one stereotypical black sheep? Don't
you have a relative embedded in your
family tree that you manage to avoid
telling your friends about? Maybe it
is your aunt who drinks too much,
buys her jewelry at Wal-Mart, and
picks up guys at the track. Or the
grandfather who thinks that red pants
look great with a pink shirt and is
currently married to his seventh wife.
Or my favorite - your second cousin
who spends more time in jail than you
spend in the library. It is a universal
law that each family have at least one
eccentric relation.

This common, albeit often hidden,
family theme is embraced by producer,
writer and director John Hughes in his
latest ﬁlm Uncle Buck. The result of '
his latest efforts is an amusing ﬁlm

   
 

that manages to both entertain the
viewer and make the moviegoer plan
on making alternate plans during their
next family reunion.

John Candy is Uncle Buck, a
character who is a 40-year-old tire
salesman who managed to never
completely grow up. He smokes cigars
because he gave up cigarettes, vacu-
ums potato chips from his chest while
watching television and lives in a
house that makes any freshman dorm
room seem immaculate. Sound like a
relative of yours? Candy plays to role
to perfection. This shouldn’t come as
any surprise since Candy has played
variations of Buck Russell in many of
his past film roles, speciﬁcally in ﬁlms
like Splash and Planes, Trains and
Automobiles. The character never starts
to grate on the audience’s nerves
because Candy makes him so believ-
able. He never overacts.

The ﬁlm is at its funniest when

Buck interacts with his two youngest

charges, Miles and Maisy Russell.‘

Many stars hate working with child
actors: who wants to be overshad-
owed by a ﬁve-year—old'.7 Thankfully,
Candy had no problem working with
children, and the comedy in the ﬁlm
is raised several notches in the scenes
where he works with the younger
actors. The kitchen interrogation scene
between Miles and Buck, a wonderful
parody of the old Dragnet television
show, is alone worth the price of
admission.
The ﬁlm is not perfect, however.
It does bog down when Hughes fo-
cuses on the tension between Buck
and his oldest niece, Tia Russell. As
noted before, many of Hughes’ ﬁlms,
like The Breakfast Club and Ferris
Bueller's Day Off, portray teenagers as
misunderstood victims that are alien-
ated from their parents, or the teenag-
ers arc budding comedians who at-

The album would not be needed
to support a Rolling Stones tour.
Even Keith Richards said, in a Play-
boy magazine interview, that money
was a major reason for the tour.
But luckily, the album exhibits ten
terriﬁc new Stones songs which will
gladly be devoured by legions of
’ravenous Rolling Stones die—hards.

alaugh

tempt to make adults look like fools
with their rapid-ﬁre wit. The concept
works in previous ﬁlms, but rings
hollow in Uncle Buck. I tired quickly
of Tia’s cheap impersonation of Molly
Ringwald as she poured and snarled
her way through the movie.

Yet Hughes ultimately avoids
becoming his own stereotype, and the
movie doesn't leave the viewer disap-
pointed. The end of the movie will
not surprise anyone as Buck makes
the first decision of his life: should
he return to his carefree life of a
bachelor, or has his week-long baby-
sitting experience started his own
biological clock ticking?

We aren't talking Shakespeare,
folks, but you will come out of the
movie smiling. Peppers will grade it
a “B.” Not a bad mark for the begin-
ning of the school year.

Uncle Buck is currently playing at
the State Theater. It is rated PG for
mild profanity.

And coming in October  Watch for our new bar and lounge
  with an extended menu, billiards and darts!

Thank you W&L for making
The FAST LANE such a success!   ?
