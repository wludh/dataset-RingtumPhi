VMI holds
birthday
bonanza

By Spain Brumby
Staff Reporter

Last weekend the nation’s first
military college, Virginia Military
Institute, celebrated its 150th birthday
with activities for alumni, faculty, and
cadets.

Marking its sesquicentennial year,
several VMI cadets buried a time
capsule Friday that will be uncovered
during VMI’s bicentennial year, 2039.

The time capsule, which was
buried in front of the Stonewall Jack-
son statue at VMI, contained shoulder
boards, hop tickets, a private’s belt,
an athletic schedule, a Rat Bible, a
copy of the VMI Cadet newspaper, a
Corps roster with room numbers, a
class ring, a special calculator and a
list of all the current administration
and staff.

Following the burial of the time
capsule, there was a concert in VMI’s
Cameron Hall featuring the U.S.
Army Field Band and Soldiers’ Cho-
rus under the direction of Colonel
William E. Clark.

On Saturday, VMI’s actual birth-
day, Dr. Harvey S. Sadow, an alum-
nus and member VMI Board of Visi-
tors, dedicated VMI's new science
building, which was completed in
August.

The new four-story science facility
located adjacent to Mallory Hall
contains chemistry and biology labo-
ratories, a science information center,
a specialized library, faculty offices
and supply rooms.

The grand finale of the weekend
was VMI’s 20-10 victory over its
arch rival The Citadel.

More than 8,000 people attended
the 49th playing of “The Military
Classic of the South,” making it the
second largest home game crowd in
VMI’s football history.

FD auditor

jumps

ship

Fowler cites time demands

By Stacy Morrison
Editor

Fancy Dress Auditor Terance
Fowler resigned Monday night at the
Executive Committee meeting, con-
tinuing the personnel problems that
have troubled the Student Activities
Board since September.

“The reason I left is because I
didn‘t want to be a martyr for Fancy

Dress. I left for myself,” he said.
In his letter of resignation he cited
both “academic and personal
reasons.”

Fowler explained that the enor-
mous time demand the post has re-
quired was a major consideration in
his resignation. As auditor, Fowler
settled out last year’s outstanding ac-
counts, as well as wrote early budgets
for this year’s ball.

“I felt I was getting nowhere with
it all. There was nothing else I
could give up except studying, and I
wasn’t willing to do that,” said Fow-
ler.

Fancy Dress Chairman Alex Hitz
said, “I’m sorry Terance is going.
He can run that computer like nobody
else, which is something I can't do.”

Hitz said that the accounting work
for Fancy Dress has been heavier
than before. “The budget we are
presenting this year has been difficult
because it has been so much more
extensive.”

Although he doesn't know yet
who will replace Fowler, Hitz thinks
the auditor’s job is one a student can
‘ ' “I think if a student can
organize all the different areas of a
ball with the help of other students

than certainly a student can handle its
ﬁnances,” said Hitz.

Fowler disagreed, saying the posi-
tion requires a “really big commit-
merit.”

_ “I don't think any student has the
time,” he said. “I really respect
Charles [Conklin, SAB Chairman]
and Alex and Will [Jones, SAB Vice
Chairman], and anyone else who is
willing to put so much time into one
activity. And I agree with Liz
Smith: It‘s a thankless job."

Fowler said the duties of auditor
were not made easier by internal
problems within the board. “I can
do the actual accounting, but it takes
cooperative people who can work
together,” he said.

Fowler was unwilling to detail
any specific conflicts within the
board. “I don't want to become a
martyr in The Ring-tum Phi, either.
I did not leave because of personal
conﬂicts, because if it had been only
that, I would have stayed.”

Hitz said he thinks the FD Steer-
ing Committee has been running
smoothly since the new position was
created. However, he did say he
thinks “people should let everyone
do his own job and have the decen-
cy to trust others to do their own
jobs without there always being a
feeling of mistrust." He said the
board has had the tendency toward
“ automatic accusations.”

EC President Willard Dumas said,
“It really bothers me that an envir-
onment was created that made a good
student leave the committee because
of the petty bullshit that goes on.

Vivian said blacks and whites use

Vivian said one cannot be fair to
blacks until he deals honestly with

Vivian encouraged students to take

W&L students attend rally

By Alisann McGloin

/Staff Reporters

Several Washington and Lee stu-
dents and Rockbridge County resi-
dents joined hundreds of thousands of
pro-choice demonstrators at the rally
sponsored by the National Organiza-
tion for Women in Washington D.C.
Sunday, Nov. 12th.

The rally, held at the Lincoln
Memorial, was among 1,000 events
held in over 150 cities from Maine to
Alaska on a day designated by NOW
as “Mobilize for Women’s Lives.”

Pamela Simpson, an art professor
at W&L, is an officer in the local
NOW chapter consisting of about 75
members.

In preparation for the rally, the
chapter placed an advertisement in
the local newspaper and posted signs.
Simpson helped coordinate rides
among interested students and resi-
dents.

“I think the most positive expe-
rience was being surrounded by peo-
ple who share your point of view,”
Simpson said. “It‘s reassuring to
know that there are that many people
out there.”

Junior Katy Roggenburk said she
was especially interested in the
speech given by Iowa’s Lt.Gov. Jo
Anne Zimmerman, warning the pro-
testers to question the true intentions
of candidates claiming to support
their cause.

Roggenburk said she was con-
cerned with politicians claiming to be
pro—choice but failing to back their
promises once elected.

they want, they need control of their

Guest speakers at the rally re-

Reproductive Health Services.

Many speakers referred to the
gubernatorial elections in New Jersey

pro-choice candidates were victorious.

Learning for life

This afternoon in Northen Auditorium, there was a
teleconference about Acquired Immune Deﬁciency
Syndrome. We hope you went.

What images come to the mind of an average W&L
student about AIDS? Some poor, homeless man, wasting
his welfare money to shoot up heroin with a dirty needle?
Either that or some lowlife homosexual who deserves what
he gets because God willed it that way.

Dean Buddy Atkins, at the Nov. 6 Interfratemity Council
meeting, quoted statistics from the Centers for Disease
Control which say that college-age heterosexuals are the
fastest-growing age group in terms of the number of AIDS
cases. That means us. I

According to Atkins, some surveys say as many as three

in 1,000 college women have been infected with the AIDS
Vll'llS.

If those statistics hold true for W&L, then there are one
or two women here who have been infected with a disease
that allows even minor illnesses to eat away at their bodies
and minds for years, at they might not even know it yet. It
might even be someone you know.

AIDS can happen anywhere anytime, despite our best
efforts to ignore it, and the sooner we all understand that,
the better off everyone will be.

Comedian Sam Kinison once observed that the average
person, in his somewhat irreverent view, cannot name one
heterosexual who has died of AIDS. We submit that we
would like to keep it that way, particularly at W&L.

To say that AIDS presents the same threat to W&L
students as it does to those groups designated as “high
risk” is, of course, ludicrous. Equally ludicrous, however,
is the notion that W&L students are, by some miracle,
exempt from the disease.

Admittedly, the condom machine near the door to the
inﬁrmary is, at best, unusual or, at worst, offensive. To say
nothing of the condom machine in, of all places, the Gaines
laundry room, complete with a small library of AIDS
information pamphlets. Call it an “everything you wanted to
know about AIDS, but were afraid to ask” literature section.

Despite their slightly maudlin, almost comically so,
content, such sights have become, by default, a glimpse of
a rather grim reality.

It is no longer possible for us to blithely ignore the
possibility that one of us could die, right here at W&L.

It is not solely the university’s responsibility to educate
the student body about AIDS. Any such school-sponsored
program concerning AIDS would, without doubt, be the
subject of scorn and widespread disregard. We, as students,
shouldn't have to rely on the university to tell us what we
should already know.

We applaud the Health Education Committee for its
efforts in bringing the teleconference to W&L. It would be
a shame for those efforts to have been wasted because n
one cared enough to go. - -

Legal abortion: its safe and...

MY VIEW
By Pamela H. Simpson

This is in response to Richard Hill's “My
View" article in the Nov. 9 issue (“States Should
Say No To Abortion”). This gentleman was in his
turn responding to an article by Pam Patton and
Betsy 'Parkins who were in their turn responding
to an article by J. Cameron Hurnphries. So the
debate goes on. Since Richard has stated so
clearly the anti-abortion argument, I feel the
necessity to more fully state the pro—choice
position.

He is right in contending that the Supreme
Court has recently reversed the trend of 16 years
of legal decisions and seems bent on giving states
greater authority to restrict access to abortion.

. While I disagree with his analysis of Roe v. Wade

(it was not a “mishap of legal history,” it was

an assertion of the constitutional right to privacy), 0

it is nevertheless clear that in the future the debate
over abortion will be taken‘ up at the state level.

The basic difference between the anti-abortion
and the pro-choice positions is summarized in
Richard's logical syllogism: (1) A fetus is a
human being. (2) Killing a human being is
murder. (3) The states outlaw murder; therefore,
the states should outlaw all abortions. There it is,
simple as one, two, three. The problem is, of
course, that there are inherent fallacies in this
reasoning.

Let's take the first premise that a fetus is a
human being. Richard may believe that, but there

Let’s consider who is being
murdered if abortion
becomes unattainable.
Before 1973  there were at
least 100 deaths for every
1,000 performed. By con-
trast, the rate now with
safe, legal abortion is only
three per 1,000. Legal abor-
tion saves lives.

is no other clear consensus on this issue among
medical authorities, religious leaders, or scholars
of moral and ethical studies. No one can clearly
say at what “moment" life begins. Fertilization
and initial cell division of the zygote takes at least
three days. Implantation of the blastocyst begins
no sooner than six days and is not complete for
another 14 to 21 days. Two out of every three
fertilized eggs rniscarry naturally during the first
six weeks after fertilization. Is that “murder” by
some unseen forces? The problem is that if you
make no differentiation between the born and the
unborn, if you insist on anthropomorphizing a
dividing cell into a human being, then you fall
into the kind of simplistic thinking that the anti-
abortionists continue to demonstrate. It is not that
simple. I heard one local politician assert recently
that if a woman was raped and the next day took
a morning—after pill that resulted in the abortion of

a fertilized egg, then she was guilty of murder.

v

6

That is the sort of muddle-headed reasoning that '

the equation of eggs and human life leads to.

His second premise is that killing a human
being is murder, leading him to equate abortion
with murder. Let’s consider who is being
murdered if abortion becomes unattainable. Before
1973, illegal abortion was the leading killer.of
pregnant women in the United States. There were
at least 100 deaths for every 1,000 performed. By
contrast, the rate now with safe, legal abortion is
only three per 100,000. Legal abortion saves lives.
The anti—abortion position would value the
potential life of ' a developing zygote over the
already established life of a fully developed human
being.

One argument pro-choice advocates make is
that barming abortion legally would not stop
abortions at all. It would simply take us back to
the pre—l973 position where poor women and
vulnerable teenagers risked their lives to obtain
abortions, and affluent women ﬂew to foreign
countries to get them. Today, safe legal abortions
are still relatively available to everyone. The risk
of dying in pregnancy is 13 times greater than that
of dying in an abortion. Further, matemal
mortality has dropped dramatically since the
legalization of abortion —- in other words,
abortions do save lives, women's lives.

Finally, there is the conclusion Richard makes
that since the state outlaws murder, it should
outlaw all abortions. I can see where his lockstep
logic has led him to this extreme position. Most
anti-abortionists do at least allow medical

THE STUDENT VOICE OF WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

MY VIEW
By Brian Root

For the last several weeks, the
issue of legalized abortion has been
discussed to the point of exhaustion
in The Ring-tum Phi. Despite this
treatment, the newest aspect of the
debate on abortion has been over-
looked. Virginia Lt. Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder, in a political masterstroke,
raised it in the recent, somewhat
bitter race for governor — and the
result appears to have been a narrow
victory for the moderate Democrat.

Perhaps you saw some of his
commercials — the ones that weren’t
questioning Marshall Coleman’s man-
hood or descent. In particular, I refer
to the ad that pictured Wilder at
Monticello, with a statue of Thomas
Jefferson in the background, complete
with the obligatory patriotic music.

While that may sound perfectly ordi-
nary, the content of that ad has
revolutionized how abortion is dis-
cussed.

Instead of repeating the same old
pro-choice argument, Wilder brilliant-
ly turned the tables on the
Republicans. He said Coleman, who
was on record for opposing abortion
in virtually all cases, would allow the
government to interfere with the
people's right to choose. That is a
vitally important distinction.

By changing the scope of the
abortion debate, Wilder shed the
traditional view that all Democrats
are pro-big government and against
individual and state autonomy. By
doing so, "he painted Coleman as
someone who would take our rights
away. And on that ground alone,
Wilder won the govemor’s mansion.

Almost overnight, the abortion
issue went from politically untouch-
able to an absolutely essential item

that could only be avoided at the
candidate's peril.

For years, the Democrats have
based their pro—choice argument on a
tenuous ‘when does life begin’ assor-
tion. Now they are in a position to
steal the so-called high ground.

Ronald Reagan began an entire
political revolution with the simple
statement: “Let’s get the government
off the backs of the people.” But, as
Wilder has pointed out, it is in fact
the current policy of many Republi-
cans to allow the government to
intervene — a stigma usually reserved
for Democrats.

If the GOP is to win the battle of
public opinion on abortion, the party
must moderate its heretofore extreme
position, much as the Democrats must
moderate many of their positions if
they are to reclaim the White House.

Recently, two Republican gover-
nors, Thomas Kean of New Jersey
and James Thompson of Illinois, said

the GOP must either moderate its
stance on abortion or simply leave
the decision about the issue to the
individual candidates.

With the Supreme Court's recent
Webster decision giving some control
over abortion back to the states, the
issue will soon become one of, if not
the, biggest issues in state and local
politics for the next decade.

The key for either party to cap-
ture public opinion on this rather
emotionally—charged issue is modera-
tion. Both sides must control the
extreme ends of their membership.
Most opinion polls agree that the
public’s ideas on abortion lie sorne—
where between the Pat Robertsons

and the Jesse Jacksons of the world. "

For now however, the ball is in
the Republicans’ court. If their strict
overall view of abortion is not some-
how modiﬁed and moderated, they
risk losing touch with much of their
constituency, particularly women.

LETTERS

Writers give thanks for seven days

I am writing in response to the proposal in
last week's Phi to do a way with the week-long
Thanksgiving break in favor of two shorter
breaks. This proposal is ludicrous. At a school
like Washington and Lee where more than half
of the students come from outside Virginia, the
trek home can often be both arduous and
expensive. Driving long distances to go home for
a week is trying enough, much less making the
same trip twice within a month to stay for only
a few days. And for those who fly, correct me
if I’m wrong, two plane tickets cost more than
one.

It is also necessary to consider those who
aren’t on their parents’ monthly payroll. Those
students who work during their breaks in order
to make ends meet at school will tell you it is
easier to find a job over the week-long
Thanksgiving break than it would be to work
over two long weekends. Work is easier to find

and the pay is generally better over Thanksgiving
break because more employees are left to fill
voids created by vacationing employees.

I really don’t think the argument that this
first long stretch of classes makes students so
homesick and stressed out that they have to go
home before Thanksgiving is a valid one. If
some students can't spend a little over two
months without seeing their parents, then perhaps
W&L should set up a babysitting service for
them. For those who do get homesick, I’ve heard
the phone can work wonders, and for those who
get too stressed over work, try blowing off
Friday classes and having a few beers.

Sincerely,
Chris Owen, ’92

I am strongly opposed to changing the present
system of vacations. One of the great aspects of

our Thanksgiving break is its length. Having
nine days off allows time to actually do
something for the holiday. While students with
three or four-day holidays barely have time to
visit the nearest big city, W&L students have
time to go on short trips or, more importantly,
go home.

Even those from the West Coast have
enough time to warrant a trip home, a privilege
I find important on such a farnily—oriented
holiday. Yes, the first ten weeks is a long haul,
but it is worth the wait. Besides, we have
Parents’ Weekend to help us through the term.
If we split the vacation, we would have two
short breaks barely giving us the time to leave
campus: I would rather have time to go home.
In short, leave our vacations alone!

Sincerely,
Harley Walsh, ’91

MY VIEW

i By J. Cameron

Humphries

A couple of weeks ago at dimer,
a friend was reading one of my
articles in The Ring—tum Phi when he
turned to me and said, “This is all

;- fine and good, but you have to

realize that morality is passé.”
Although my friend probably did

7, not realize how profound his state-
: ment was, or the implications it
? carried, I was nevertheless impressed

:_ with his conclusion. Not because I

. agreed with him, but because, unlike

most people these days, his statement
at least indicated that he recognized

‘ that morality either exists absolutely
or it does not exist at all. Unlike me,

however, he chose to believe that it
does not exist.

But that leaves him light years
ahead of most of the other people
sitting at our table. They claimed that
my friend was a fool. According to
these other people, of course morality
exists. Each person must determine

The War on Drugs

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

In yet one more unreasonable
attempt to try to justify itself, the
government has picked a highly-
publicized societal “problem" and
has declared “war” on it. Today’s
“war" is on drugs, and with
“Drug Czar” William Bennett in
the general’s seat, the government

_ has pledged to conquer the
“problem.”

So, like everything else involv-
ing govemment action, someone is
going to have to pay for it. In this
case, however, we’ll pay with more
than money — we'll pay with our
freedom.

I ' A recent Washington Post-ABC

,News poll showed a" few things
people would give up to support
the war on drugs. Seventy-one
percent would make it against the
law to show the use of illegal drugs
in entertainment movies. Fifty-two
percent would allow police to
search without a court order the
houses of people suspected of sell-
ing drugs, even if friends’ houses
were sometimes searched by mis-
take. Eight—seven percent would
allow ‘officials to search student
lockers for drugs, even those not
strongly suspected of drug use.

All this, to win the war on
drugs. However, the war on drugs,
like the war on poverty, is destined
to be unwinnable because there is
no official enemy. Perhaps this will
turn into the “drug conflict" in
much the same way that Vietnam
War became the “Vietnam con-
flict." Without soldiers clearly
identifiable as North Vietnamese, it
was difficult to shoot and hit the
right person. The war was hope-
less, and so we gave it up. Hope-
fully Bush will give this up, too.

what is true for himself.

Just about then another person
returned to our table from the salad
bar. As he sat down he noticed that
his drink was missing. “Hey,” he
said, “Who took my drink?"

At about this moment, he looked
across the table to see yet another
person finishing off the last of his
Dr. Pepper. “You,” he yelled across
the table, “go get me another." It
seemed his deep voice was not con-
vincing, so he threw a roll at him.

“Why should I," returned the
voice from within the glass. I found
myself in absolute agreement with
voice in the glass. Perhaps it was his
morality to take others’ drinks. So
what if he violated a social norm or
his parents’ upbringing. Isn't being
true to one’s morality more important
than upbringing or social norm?

Yet the rest of the table did not
agree with the voice in the glass, or
with me for that matter, and they all
insisted that the voice in the glass
should go get his friend another Dr.
Pepper. I did not remember the table
establishing any rules for eating there,
and I sure did not remember seeing
any rules posted outside the dining

 

battle

Or, take the “war on poverty.”
Two things remain from that war:
poverty, and a huge government bu-
reaucracy with numerous people
whose jobs depend on there existing
impoverished people. So, if the
government could eliminate all of
America's poor people tomorrow,
they'd be out of a job. Uh oh.

The catch is — the thing that
makes it all “work” — is that
“victory" is never defined. If it
were, so too would be the budgets
to accomplish it. So, by declaring
people’s own freedom to act a
public scandal, the government can
pretend to justify it's attempt to do
the impossible — and then ask that
very society to give up money and
freedom to accomplish it.

Note, too, who the enemies are:
drug users, dealers, etc. This gives
way to the logistics problem of
trying to catch them ‘all. It worked’
World War II to drop the bomb,
but it did not work in Vietnam to
send too few soldiers.-It either will
work, or it won’t.

Then, if the government could
catch all the dealers, the regular
users, the casual users, the first
time users — in other words, any-
one who has ever used any con-
trolled substance — then, what
would be the penalties? Surely the
government would not advocate the
same more-than-useless penalty that
our “Drug Czar” recently sug-
gested for dealers, that is: public
decapitation. The government could
not afford to jail all of the people
who would be arrested. Stiff ﬁnes?
Fines would not deter users greatly,
and the fines’ collection would still
not cover the cost of catching the
people and imposing the fine.

Unless we recognize soon that
the problem is not drugs but the
laws that make them illegal, soon
we’ll have more to deal with than
paying for those useless signs that
say “Drug Free School Zone.”

hall. Hmmm, I thought to myself. It
must be some common instinct within
these people telling the voice in the
glass to replace the Dr. Pepper. The
common consensus had something to
do with the right thing to do.

Now as I finished my own drink
(mine was a Sprite), I found two
instincts within myself. The first was
to get up and get myself another one.
Yet, I must admit, I also felt the
impulse to take ‘my friend’s right
there next to me. How on the merit
of these two independent impulses
could I make up my decision?

It seemed to me that there was
also a third impulse. It didn't tell me
what to do; it told me what I ought
to do. This seemed to be the gist of
the entire evening’s discussion. My
friend who said that “morality is
passé” believed that this third instinct
was an understood set of rules which
one must follow if society is to sur-
vive. He, if he really believed what
he said he believed, did not see one
option as any better than any other.
There was no such thing as right or
wrong, just rules that man invented
as he developed to keep him from

destroying himself.

Fighting friends over morality

I, on the other hand, believed that
this third instinct was not due to a
set of survival rules, but a universal
moral code under which right and
wrong really did exist. There was
deﬁnitely an action which one should
take in a given circumstance, and an
action which one should not take.
These were not determined by utility,
but by what was right. Meanwhile,
the others at the table fought it out.
The voice in the glass claimed that
there was nothing wrong with taking
someone else's drink. Each tried to
justify why his position was correct,
but it was all in vain. If one could
really determine his own morality,
why weren't both sides correct?

Quickly the table got into such a
big fight that everyone left except me
and my friend who claimed morality
was passé. And as I sat there review-
ing all that happened, in a way I
could not help but agree with him.

I would much rather live with
people who agree that man must live
by certain rules, and disagree about
the nature of their source, than in a
society that claims there is a source,
but disagrees as to whether one
should follow the rules.

Sbar: Catching the culpable canine

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Recently, it occurred to me that
I frequently begin articles with the
word “recently.” Recently, while
cleaning up vomit my dogs left in
my room over Parents’ Weekend, it
occurred to me that it has been a
long time since I wrote about
canines. ‘

Ever since the prehistoric days
when dogs showed man how to
make fire and urinate on mailboxes,

‘ the two species have been the best

of friends. Even in today's diversi-
fied society, with the exception of a
few bad apples, everyone loves
dogs. Scientists from the “you can
always count on your dog” school
of thought theorize that this affinity
stems form the famous canine fideli-
ty exhibited by Ulysses and his dog,

I Homer. Ulysses, the amazing Greek

hero who left home for about 20 or
30 years to kill Trojans and create
myths, finally returned to the patient
Homer, who recognized his master’s
aftershave, wagged his tail and died.

In my opinion, the “you can al-
ways count on your dog" scientists
are full of dog--—. Homer was only

intervention to save the life of mother,

would concede that a woman who is a victim of
rape should not be forced to carry to temr an
unwanted pregnancy. But Richard is right: if a
fetus is a human being and abortion is murder,
then there should be no exceptions, right? That’s
where simplistic thinking always leads you — past
the subtleties of reality. What of the parents who
face the danger of genetically impaired children?

Why should anyone be forced to bring

child with a disease like Tay-Sachs? What of the
cancer patient whose radiation therapy promises a
grossly deformed fetus? What of the diabetic who
faces blindness or even death if she carries to

home to greet Ulysses because it
was dinner time and Mrs. Ulysses
was, at that very moment, opening
the Kal Kan. Had there been a cat
or a female dog in the area at the
time, the “faithful” Homer would
have been nowhere in sight.

The real reason people like dogs
is that canines are the funniest ani-
mals on earth next to the Three
Stooges. People, who are constantly
thinking about death, cancer and
income tax, need dogs to make
them laugh. While you're sitting
there worrying about the Cuban
Missile Crisis your dog, Bullwinkle,
tiptoed over to the coffee table and
stuck his salivating red tongue into
your bowl of chocolate chip ice
cream. While you're sweating over
an upcoming Ancient Alaska history
exam, your dog, Theodore, is bark-
ing at the vacuum cleaner. And, fi-
nally, while you’re wondering what
strange environmental factors makes
someone write an article on the sub-
ject of dog humor, my dog, Chipper
is probably sleeping.

This, of course, brings me to the
inevitable subject of Chipper. Unlike
the canine movie star Lassie who is
constantly saving Timmy and his
semiretarded parents from tomados,
barn fires and acid rain, my dog,

term? Should these women be labeled murderers?

There is no area of American law that requires
one human being to sacriﬁce life, limb, blood, or
bodily organs for another person, but that is what
a total ban on abortion would do. I find most
disturbing, however, the callous disregard for
wornen’s lives that is inherent in the position that
Richard and the anti-abortionists maintain. They
view women as disposable vessels for producing
children. They wish to take away from women the
authority to safeguard their lives and health.
Giving precedence to zygotes and embryos over
living human beings relegates women to the 19th
century status of chattel.

by an unfriendly
highway patrolman,
switch seats with
your dog and swear
that he was driving.

As home and family are des-

Since it is now obvious that the
human race, especially Timmy’s
family, could not survive without
dogs, the rest of this pointless arti-
cle will advise readers who want to
take their dogs on long car trips.

saying that
irresponsible, too evil to make their own decisions
concerning their own lives.

That finally is the bottom line for the pro-
choice position. Few of us are “for" abortion. We
understand that there is great disagreement over
this essentially moral and religious issue. But just
as we would abhor a law that mandated a
particular religion, we also abhor all efforts to
legally take away the power of a woman to make
her own choices. There has been a lot of talk
lately about getting government off the backs of
people. It is time to make sure it stays out of
wombs of women as well.

Superdance male sale

By Joel Smith
Staff Reporter

Fund-raising for Washington and
Lee’s annual Muscular Dystrophy
Association Superdance begins tonight
at Southern Seminary Junior College,
when six Virginia Military Institute
cadets and four male W&L students
will be “sold” at auction, said Allen
Richardson, co-chairman of the
Superdance committee.

The dance will take place Feb. 2-
3 at the student activities pavilion.

Richardson said the Superdance
Committee hopes to surpass last
year’s total donation of $30,000,
which was the nation’s second-liigh-
est MDA contribution among col-
leges.

The committee lost a major sup-
porter when the W&L Student Activi-
ties Board decided to not provide
funds as it has in the past, forcing
the committee to explore other op-
tions for funding, Richardson said.

“Superdance appealed to the
[Interfratemity Council] for funds, but
they declined to make a donation on
the basis that fraternities would be
paying twice,” Richardson said.
“Other options are being pursued at
this time which will be forthcoming
in the next few weeks.”

One of those options, Richardson
said, is a proposal which would
“make Superdance the IFC’s ‘pet
charity’. Essentially, it would create a
charity for the Greek system at
W&L,” he said.

Richardson added the committee

also hopes to incorporate sororities in
the same role as fraternities “if
they’re able and willing to help.”

The committee also has other fund
raising events scheduled prior to the
dance. Tiny Purple Fishes, a classic
rock band made up of W&L stu-
dents, will play at Hollins College on
Nov. 28.

Richardson said the concert will
begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Hollins
Ratskellar, and admission is $3.

On Nov. 30, Richardson.said, the
committee will sponsor a Casino
Night in the General Headquarters
restaurant, which will be open to all
W&L students who are of legal
drinking age.

According to Richardson, admis-
sion will be $5, which includes $100
of play money and two beers. After
the “gambling” is over, winning par-
ticipants can spend their earnings at
an auction, at which a number of
prizes will be sold, including a dinner
cruise on Smith Mountain Lake, a
dinner at the Willson-Walker House,
several ski packages and gift certif-
icates from local stores and restau-
rants.

Richardson said the committee has
not hired a band for Saturday night
of the event. The committee is con-
sidering The Radiators, NRBQ, The
Fabulous Waller Family as well as
other bands.

According to Richardson, the com-
mittee is considering either one “big-
name” band or two medium-priced
bands.

ardson said.

Students who have suggestions or
ideas about Superdance can air them
tonight at the comrriittee’s meeting,
which will begin at 7 p.m. in room
109 of the University Center.

For any interested students who
miss this meeting, the committee will
also meet on Thursday, Nov. 30 at 7
p.m. in the same place.

On Friday night of the event,
there will be a Battle of the Bands.
There are currently six bands entered
in the competition, and there is room
for one more, Richardson said.

This year, the winner will be
determined by both a panel of judges
and audience support. The winning
bands will receive cash prizes.

In order to be a dancer in the
marathon fund raiser, participants
must make a $100 donation for a
single entry or a $125 donation for a
couple.

Dancers can raise the money by
collecting pledges for specific
amounts of money for every hour
they dance.

Participants will dance for 15
hours, and will receive free food and
refreshments throughout the wee-
kend, Richardson said.

As in the past, prizes will be
awarded to the dancers who raise the
most money. Anyone wishing to
dance should get an information
packet from the Superdance Comniit—
tee, or in Carol Calkins’ office in the
University Center.

Richardson said there are 50 com-
mittee members and members-at-
large, and anyone is welcome to join.

Registrar
to rake in
late fees

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

The Registrar’s Office is ex-
pecting to collect about $1,575 in
late fees from the 63 students
who failed to sign up last Friday
for Winter term courses.

Those who missed the 4:30
deadline, 28 of whom are seniors,
will be charged $25 for late regis-
tration during the drop/add period
next term.

“Never does everybody get
registered,” said University Regis-
trar Scott Dittrnan.

In addition to the late fee, stu-
dents who failed to register will
probably face long waiting lists
for many classes.

Art Department Secretary
Betty Hickox, said there was a
high number of students wanting
to get into art and music courses.
But, she said, there was a deer-
ease in sign—ups for drama.

“We did not have anybody
camp out this semester for the
first time in a very long time, ”
Hickox said. Currently there are
waiting lists for all but four of
the courses the Art Department

offers. _ _
“I did not start any waiting

lists before Monday morning, I
just don’t do that, ” said Hickox.
“I'm just so glad it’s over. I
don’t really want to talk about
it."

abortion-rights the premiere issue in

any campaign in which the candi-

dates’ opinions differ.

Demonstrators carried banners and
signs with slogans, such as "Our laws
come from the constitution, not from
the bible."

Many of the demonstrators wore
purple and white, the colors of the
suffragette movement of the early
20th‘century.

Several entertainers, including
singers Pete Seger and Ronnie Gilbert
who sang a revised version of “This
Land is Your Land” and Helen

Reddy who performed her hit “I Am
Woman,” performed for the crowd.

The demonstration, which began

with a sunrise service
Kennebunkport,
Bush's home outside of Washington,

ended that night with sunset rallies ,

in Alaska.

In addition to the pro-choice dem-
onstrators, many anti—abortion advo-
cates attendei the rally. However, no

“How am I going to get all of this
stuff into this tiny rucksack?” This
thought must have struck more than
a few of the thirty plus people from
Washington and Lee who went on the
ROTC FTX Autumn Thunder at Fort
Lee, Virginia Nov.3—5.

FTX stands for Field Training
Exercise and consists of practical
military exercises and training. This

‘FIX was held in conjunction with

Washington and Lee ROTC’s exten-
sion centers Liberty University and
Lynchburg College which provided
more than thirty additional) students.
The FIX gave students an insight
into Amiy life and helped to prepare
the third, year ROTC cadets (MS-
III’s) for advanced camp at Ft.
Bragg, North Carolina. For six
weeks after their junior year MS IHs
are tested on their leadership abilities
at Bragg’s Camp All-American.
During the FTX MS Ills assumed
various leadership positions, and the

(senior cadets (MS IVs) evaluated

their performance.

After arriving on Friday night, the
MSIVs taught a class on aspects of
barracks living, like making beds the

‘came early, except for those in com-

mand, who had to prepare for instruc-
tion the next day. Throughout the
weekend, the MS IVs taught the
underclassmen based on their
advanced camp experiences.

Saturday training began at 5 a.m.
with conditioning exercises and a two
mile run followed by breakfast in an
Army dining facility.

After chow, the first platoon
sighted their M-16A1 rifles on the 25
meter range by firing three round
shot groups at a small paper target.

In a separate training area not far
away, the second.platoon practiced
IMT (Individual Movement
Techniques). MS IVs taught the
younger cadets combat maneuvers
such as the “low crawl"(moving in
the prone position), the “high
crawl” (crawling on elbows and
knees) and the “3 to 5 second rush”
(maneuvering from one covered posi-
tion to the next). These techniques
minimize exposure to enemy ﬁre
while moving in a combat environ-
ment. _

,The second platoon also learned
to camouflage themselves and their
equipment to blend into a combat
environment. Meanwhile, the first

According to W&L freshman Tim

Wolfe, “getting to fire the M-16 at

When both platoons finished train-
ing they ate an MRE lunch (Meal

The platoons rotated activities,
finished training, and paid a visit to
the Quartermaster museum at Fort
Lee. They then moved to the mess

cadets packed their rucks, cleaned the

A good B.A.D. album

By Carll Flippen
Staff Reporter

Big Audio Dynamite has released its latest album, “Megatop Phoenix.”
and it proves to be one of their strongest efforts to date.

Due to band leader Mick Jone’s battle with pneumonia following the
release of their last album “Tighten Up, vol. 88" B.A.D. was relatively
dormant last year. However, Jone’s hospital stay and B.A.D.’s hiatus has
taken none of the bite out of the band’s rhythmic, dance-oriented sound.

Big Audio Dyna_rnite burst on to the music scene in the mid-80‘s following
the demise of Mick Jone’s first group, the intemationally successful punk
band The Clash.

B.A.D. was formed as a result of the collaboration between Jones and Don
Letts, Jone’s friend and co-songwriter. The groups first release was “This
is Big Audio Dynamite" contained classic B.A.D. tunes such as “Medicine
Show”, “Stone Thames”, and “BAD.”

On the strength of songs like those, B.A.D. established the basis of their
unique sound. They combined smooth tuneful melodies sung over driving
dance-floor drum machine rliythms with heavily produced sound effects and
tape clips from various sources, such as movies and songs by other artists.

The group's second album, “No. 10, Upping St.,” released in 1986, helped
develop the bands sound, continuing to rely on dance—club style programmed
beats and the integration of sound effects and tape clips. The most notable
songs from that album include “C’mon Every Beatbox,” “Sambadror.e,” and
“Limbo the Law.” ‘

Two years later, in 1988, we see the release of “Tighten up, vol. 88.”
On this album, Big Audio Dynamite experimented with a slightly paired
down sound. They shortened their songs and used almost no programmed
rhythms, relying upon drummer Greg Roberts for the backbeat of the songs.
However, they continued their trademark use of special effects and tape clips.

With the release of their new album “Megatop Phoenix,” Big Audio
Dynamite has continued the stripped down sound of their last album "by
releasing the most heavily produced album they have yet released.

They have returned to the programmed club-like beats of the first two
albums. The dance—beat rhythms are simply infectious on tracks like
“Rewind,” “Dragon Town,” and “James Brown.” The beat on “Union
Jack” sounds as if it had been snatched off the latest Tone Loc Album. Of
course, the similarity to rap music ends, as Mick Jones begins to sing catchy,
hook-laden melodies over these heavy dance-beats. B.A.D. has never made
such extensive‘use of special effects before. Five if the seventeen tracks are
made of what could be described as random music.

For instance the track "Is Yours Working Yet?” opens with some
swirling keylxoards over which one hears Alfred Hitchcock speaking. This
is suddenly interrupted by a heavy drum machine beat with keyboards
playing what sounds like an old-fashioned movie score on top.

'llais goes on for a minute or so, then as this fades out, the tape of some
nariielcss reggae band fades in brieﬂy. Although these clips may seem as if
they are chaotic and pointless, B.A.D uses these rzaidom music tracks
together, allowing the hour long record to flow along without as many of the
typical breaks between songs.

In this context, these random music tracks work very well. There is also
plenty of MTV/radio airplay material on the record.

SPORTS

. By Jay Plotkln

It was the way it should have
' been.

In the last game of the 1989

football season, the senior class went
. out with a bang Washington and
, Lee defeated Geor etown 20-10 last
, S:-ilurday in Washington, D.C.

Said head coach Gary Fallon, “I
was real happy for the seniors. We
had come up short in the two previ-

vous games, and I lcriew that they
were quite frustrated and disap-
pointed. I’m just tickled for them that
they were able to get that bad taste
out of their mouth and come away
with a victory in their last game.”

Offensively, senior quarterback
Phillip Sampson rebounded from his
rough outing at Ursinus two weeks
ago and threw two touchdown passes,
including the game-winner with just
over 12 minutes left in the game.
Slot back Scott Jackson caught a 33-
yard touchdown pass to give W&L a
10-0 lead early. Chris Smythe, whose
it-cord-setting performance against
Ursinus almost pulled out a win, also
played and moved the team briefly.

Deferisively, senior tackles Scott
Silvcrman and Dave Radulovic res-
ponded to Fallon’s claim that they
were a “swiss cheese defense with
lots of holes" and registered 10
tackles and a sack apiece. Comerbaek
Bland Warren broke up four Hoya

— passes on the afternoon in his best
effort of the season.

But it was not just the seniors
who stood out. Junior split end Craig
lions had another outstanding day,
setting the school records for catches
and receiving yards in a season with
his eight receptions for 135 yards and
:lie game-winning touchdown. Tail-

. we

Phllllp Sampson

back Kirk Sohonage, another junior,
making his second straight start in
place of Mason Pope, ran for over
100 yards, including a 69-yard
scamper that iced the game for the
Generals.

On the defensive side of the ball,
sophomore John McCallum made 10
tackles, two for a loss, had a quarter-
back sack and blocked a field goal,
after breaking a bone in his arm in
the first half. Classmate Scott Wil-
liamson was in on 10 other tackles
and had a sack. Four of Williamson’s
tatzkles were for losses. freshman Phil
Spears got his first start, replacing the
injured Greg Kiehl kept the Hoyas in
check on the right side of the line.

W&L opened the scoring after
McCallum blocked Tom Timperrnan’s
42-yard field goal attempt on Geor-
getown’s first drive. The Generals
drove down to the Hoya 15-yard line
before calling on the placement ser-
vices of junior Carter Quayle.

Cralg Irons

Quayle’s 32-yard kick was good off
the astroturf surface, and the Generals
had a 3-0 lead.

Sampson added to that total two
drives later. On fourth and two from
the Georgetown 33, Sampson found

Jackson as the Hoyas came with a,

blitz. Jackson caught a five yard pass,
turned the comer and found no one
between him and the end zone. His
touchdown made it 10-0 with 9:11 to
play in the first half.

Timpeiman got the Hoyas on the
board late in the half with a 41-yard
field goal, and the Hoyas drew even
to start the third quarter. J.J. Williams
was the Hoya who did the most
damage, carrying eight times on the
11-play, 60-yard drive, including the
last three yards into the end zone to
make the score 10-10.

To try to spark the offense, Fallon
gave Smythe a look at quarterback,
and after driving the team to mid-
field, Smythe made his only mistake

of the game. His pass intended for
Irons was intercepted by Sean Green,
who returned it 24 yards to the W&L
35.

The defense held, and after
another uneventful series for the
offense, Sampson was back at the
controls. “We weren't moving the
ball offensively," said Fallon, “so I
tried Chris to see if he could catch a
spark like he did at Ursinus. He
wasn't able to this week, so I
decided to go back to Phillip to
throw into the wind.”

Sampson wasted little time in
breaking the 10-10 deadlock. Two
completions to Irons netted 21-yards
each, and the Generals were at the
Georgetown 23. A completion to
Sohonage got the ball to the 16,
where Sampson and Irons hooked up
for the game-winning score. It was
Sampson's 14th touchdown pass of
the year, tying the school record
which he set in 1987. Irons’ catch
tied the record for receptions in a
season with 74. Irons’ was able to
break the record help by Steve
Mahaffey on the Generals’ next pos-
session.

“It is a great pleasure to coach
talent like Craig has. He is the tough-

  
    
  
    
 
 
  

est receiver that we have ever had
here. Craig has caught the majority
of his passes going over the middle.
Most people don’t like to go over the
middle, but Craig thrives on it."

The touchdown drive came im-
mediately after Timperrnan was just
short on a 51-yard field goal try with
the wind at his back. Just as Timper-
man approached the ball, a healthy
wind died, and the kick was just
short. After the play, the wind kicked
up again.

The game was not out of reach
until the defense came up with a

Grapplers look to fresh to rebound

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team under head coach Gary Franke
looks to rebound from last year’s
disappointing 2-9 record while em-
phasizing youth as nine freshmen join
only three retumers from last year’s
team.

Co—captains Lee Garlove, a senior,
and Larry Pilkey, a junior, should
provide the backbone for the young
team. Sophomore Peer Soderberg will
be counted on heavily as well. Franke
hopes the freshmen will benefit from
their experience and leadership.
Pilkey will handle the chores at 126
pounds while Garlove is the 142-
pounder. Soderberg will most likely
move up a weight class this year and
grapple at 167 pounds.

Garlove, a 1988 Academic All-
American, compiled a winning record,
4-2, in limited action last year, sitting
out much of the season with a head
injury. Garlove looked favorably upon
this year’s schedule which is loaded
with tournaments and multiple team
meets. Said Garlove, “It will be good
for both upperelassmen and freshmen.
The freshmen will gain experience by

1

wrestling multiple teams instead of
the one wrestled in dual meets.”

Pilkey also amassed a winning
record last year as well as 42 team
points, third on the team. Pilkey
hopes to be even stronger this year.
Qualifying for the national tournament
at the conclusion of the season and
wrestling effectively once there is
Pilkey’s number one goal. He feels
the team will be successful and com-
petitive “if the freshmen advance
properly and adapt to college style
wrestling.”

Pilkey applauded the schedule
which has only one week-night dual
meet noting the valuable energy
saved as the wrestlers will not be
forced to cut weight twice a week for
multiple months.

Soderberg returns to the squad for
his second season. Last year voted
the outstanding freshmen wrestler, he
compiled an 11-6 record.

Other than those three returners,
the Generals have undergone a face-
lift from last year’s team. Graduation
losses include Richard Redfoot and
Manoli Loupassi, two key perfonners
on the 1988-89 squad. Redfoot com-
piled a 23-4-1 record while becoming
an NCAA Division III semi-finalist
and the first wrestling All-American

 

 

Larry Pilkey

in Washington and Lee history. Al-
though it will be difficult, Franke
hopes some of his new freshmen can
step forward and fill these voids.,
Although the squad has had previ-
ous trouble ﬁlling all the weight
classes, the large freshmen turnout

this year should allow Franke to ﬁeld

a complete line-up. The gem of the
freshmen class could be Ryland Scott,
last year’s 160-pound Georgia state
champ. The other freshmen are
Andy Bleyer, John Conkling, Stewart
Green, Doug Lamb, Rich Paini, Cary
Potts, Jamie Selway and Andrew
Tucker.

Franke got the first competitive
look at many of his young wrestlers
Sunday when the Generals visited the
VMI Keydet Invitational. Pilkey,
Soderberg, and Conkling all placed
against strong competition. This pre-
season tournament, designed with
shortened periods, allows individuals
to gain much needed experience in
the early season and also allows
individuals to overcome pre-season
jitters. “The key was to get those
youngsters some experience and get
them over their nervousness,” said
Franke. The W&L mentor was
pleased to see_ half of the squad
place, realizing the technical aspect
will improve in the others soon.

Franke is entering his seventeenth
season as the,W"ashingtor‘i and Lee
wrestling’ coach. He has compiled 122
wins in those years, more wins than
any other W&L wrestling coach in

~ history. Rolf Pirariian will once again

handle the chores of assistant coach.

Generals ‘ready’
for tough slate

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

“There is absolutely no question
in my mind that we overachieved last
year, and I’ve told the team that
constantly,” said Washington and Lee
head basketball coach Verne Canfield.
“I also believe that there is no better
complement than to be told that you
overachiev .”

Last year, the Generals were
picked to finish fifth in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference pre-
season coaches poll. They proceeded
to win the regular season title and
come within one game of earning an
automatic bid to the NCAA Division
III post-season tournament before
falling in the conference tournament
championship game to Hampden-
Sydney.

That perforrnance earned W&L a
pre-season ranking of tenth in the
nation in Basketball Weekly.

With 10 of last year’s top 11
players returning, Canfield decided to
work the team harder this year than
in the past. “Practices have heen
geared to extend the players and push
them to be better, and they have
responded for the most part, especial-
ly the conditioning.”

Last year’s team finished 20-7,
and Canfield wants the team com-
prised of the same players to extend
themselves and their games this
season. “It is imperative that we
have are a better team this year. If
we play just as well as we did last
year, we could have a .500 season
this year. If we can extend it, we can
have a very fine year. We will have
a better team than we had last year,
but we may not win as many
games.”

Leading the returnees are four of
the five starters, including Honorable
Mention All-American junior center
Chris Jacobs. Jacobs was also the
first sophomore to win ODAC Player-
of-the-Year honors, which he did last
season. Also back is junior guard
Mike Holton, a second team All-
South Atlantic region player and
academic All-American last season.

Joining them will be classmates
Ed Hart and Craig Hatfield, both of
whom were starters last season,

. juniors Jim Casey, Andrew Manson,

Scott Alrutz and Pat Gallavan, and
sophomores Mark Melton, Courtney
Penn, Rick Hughes, John Wither-
ington and Franklin Pridgen.

This year’s team will be com-
prised of eight juniors, five soph-
omores and four freshmen. The only
loss was Lee Brading (11.2 ppg) at
shooting guard. The roles, however,
will be different. The Generals lost
more than Brading’s point-per-game
average. They also lost his valuable
senior leadership.

Holton will serve as team captain
this year, but he can’t lead the team
alone. “The nucleus of this team is a_
.year older, a year smarted, a year
wiser» and a year more experienced.’
Right now I’m a little disappointed

that I haven’t seen that manifested in »

terms of experience and leadership.”

Holton, last year’s point guard,‘
will move over to shooting guard,
where he will better be able to utilize
his three-point shooting percentage.
He led the team in three-point per-
centage last year, making 44 percent.
Casey will take over the point, where
he started five games last year. Said
Canfield, “We will be counting on
Jim to provide excellent floor leader-
ship with his balance of penetration
and outside shooting."

In the front court, Hart (11.4 ppg,
6.0 reb) and Hatﬁeld (7.4, 4.5) will
be counted on to take some of the
offensive burden off Jacobs, who
averaged 19.3 points and 7.7 re-
bounds a contest last season. Said
Canfield, “Teams will be stupid to
not to try to keep Chris from scoring,
and he knows that. He will need to
pass the ball more than he did last
year, and _if I've had one problem
with him so far this year, it's that he
is overpassing."

Gallavan scored nine points in the
first half four times last year. Penn
will be looked to as a defensive
specialist. Alrutz, Witherington and
Melton will rotate in the frontcourt,
and Hughes, Manson and freshman
Bryan Watkins will spell Holton and
Casey in the backcourt.

“We have a nine-man rotation
with one or two specialist roles. One
of the specialists will be Courtney
Penn, the defensive specialist, and the
other is Pat Gallavan and he’s the
three-point shooter,” said Canfield.
“When their particular forte is on,
their playing time will increase.

“It will be alright for Chris to be
one of the reasons for our success,
and I like it that way. But I also
want everyone else in that nine-man

rotation to be able to have nights
where they can say they were the
reason for the success.”

This year’s schedule provides l'lO|
breaks for the Generals. From the
outset of the season this weekend, the
Generals will take on their toughest
slate in Canfield’s 26-year career
here. After the Tip-Off Tournament
the Generals dive head first into
ODAC play, taking on the top two
teams in the pre-season poll, Ran-
dolph-Macon and Hampden-Sydney.
R-MC is ranked third in the pre-
season Division III poll.

The ODAC could be the strongest
it has ever been. Emory and Henry
returns two all-ODAC performers
from last year’s team, and Hampden-
Sydney returns four of five starters
from the team that won the'con-
ference tournament. Virginia Wes-
leyan and Randolph-Macon are new-

comers to the conference this year‘,_

and both a perennially strong. R-MC
drops down from Division II, where
they return three starters from a team
that finished ranked in the top 20.

The key to this season, says Can-
field, is gathering some momentum
from. the start. “We’ve got to be
ready to play and play as a unit. We
will know where we stand in the
ODAC right off the bat, and if we
can do well early and get some
momentum, we'll be alright. I think
we'll be ready.” ~ ’

Swimmers open year with routs

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

Both the Washington and Lee
men’s and women's swimming teams
are experiencing transitional periods
this season due to changes in their
rosters.

Several players have dropped off
the team, yet the remaining members
and promising freshmen are more
than talented enough to continue the
aquatics prograrn’s record of Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
NCAA national champions, according
to assistant coach Sandy Hatfield.

“I expect the men to be swim-
ming well since they just completed
a great water polo season and are in
excellent physical condition. The
women also have had an impressive
pre-season,” she said.

The women have lost five team-
mates through graduation and time-
commitment difficulties. Among those
who graduated were Elizabeth Miles
and Nancy Whalen. Miles was a two-
time ODAC and American States
Championships Swimmer-of- the-
Year and a four-time Division III
All-American. Whalen achieved the
All-ODAC status three times.

“We’ve certainly been hurt by the
loss [of these women], not only be-
cause of their physical talent, but also
because of their spirit and
leadership,” Remillard said.“That
will be especially hard to replace.
The whole team is going to have to
grow to replace that spirit.”

The W&L women have ample
talent to rely on this winter, though.

' Senior co-captain Kris Amoroso
placed first in the ODAC 200-meter
and second in the 100-meter back-
stroke and 50-meter freestyle last
year. Juniors Sharon Coleman, Carol
Darmelly, Rachelle Nock, and Kristen
Wagner all boast outstanding records.

Coleman holds a Division III All-
American title in the 200-meter but-
terﬂy, and is the defending champion
in both the 100- and 200-meter but-

Polo falters at Easterns

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

21-7 is a good record.

If you were a pitcher, it would
probably earn you a million dollar
contract. If you were a college bas-
ketball coach, it would have you
wondering where you were going to
play in the NCAA tournament.

For the members of the Wash-
ington and Lee water polo team, the
21-7 record they-earned this year is a
bittersweet accomplishment.

They returned from the Eastern
Water Polo Championships distressed
over having fallen to Brown, Slippery
Rock, and Iona, despite having been
no worse than tied at halftime of
each game.

However, that the team even got
invited to Eastems, which is reserved
for the East’s top eight teams, ful-
ﬁlled head coach Page Remillard’s
stated pre-season goal. And while the
team came away without a victory,
Remillard was convinced that it
wasn't for lack of effort. “We played
at our top all season, but when we
got to the championships we just
couldn’t keep wirming,” he explained.

W&L was placed higher in the
tournament bracket than their coach
anticipated, seeded 6th, but they
seemed intent on validating that posi-
tion with a strong first game effort
against eastern power Brown. The
Generals had lost to Brown earlier in
the year, 15-3, but they were tied at
halftime of Saturday's game, 4-4.

This was despite the ejection of
standout sophomore Will Davis early
in the second quarter for unnecessary
rough play. Davis had scored two
goals in the game at the time he was
ejected.

Brown slowly pulled away,
though, outscoring W&L by two
goals in the third quarter and one
goal in the fourth quarter to triumph
11-8. Sophomore Alan Herrick and
senior Adam Morgan each had two
goals to tie Davis for the scoring
lead.

The next game, against Slippery
Rock, was one that Remillard said he
“agonized" over. The Generals led
by three goals with just 3:45 to go in
the game, but couldn't put Slippery
Rock away, losing 11-9 in overtime.

“We just didn’t have the killer
instinct,” said Remillard. “We started
well, but if a team stayed with us we
had trouble.”

Said Herrick, “We were playing
to finish the game out. Our intensity
didn't fall off much, but it was
enough to let a team that wanted to
come back do it."

Remillard echoed this statement,
saying that his young team let their
minds wander because they thought

they had the game won.
The loss dampened ﬁne efforts by
senior goalie David Olson (11 blocks)

town's last drive. On fourth and one
from the W&L 25, Williarris carried
to the left of W&L‘s defensive line.
Freshman Lyle Smith and junior
Clark Wight combined to knock
Williarris down for no gain, and
W&L took over on downs. On the
first play, Sohonage spun through the
line and took off down the sideline.
He was caught at the Georgetown six
after a 69-yard gallop. Quayle then
capped the scoring with a 19-yard
field goal to make the score 20-10.
On the season, the Generals finish
5-5 and with a good taste in their
mouths. “This is something that will
make the winter go by a heck of a
lot better,” said Fallon. “We feel
good about what we accomplished in

terfly. Dannelly and Wagner, the
team’s distance specialists, finished in
the ODAC top four in the 500- and
1650-meter events last year. Nock
captured first place in last year's
ODAC 1()0- and 200-meter breast-
stroke competitions.

Sophomore Jody Herring won the
ODAC 100-meter freestyle and will
aid the team as its strongest sprinter.
Three freshmen, Claire Dudley, Chris-
tine Gorrnan, and Stephanie Sauers,
join the squad this year as well and
will add depth and diversity to the
team’s performance.

As for the men, Remillard and the
team are not about to rest on their
laurels. That would be tempting,
considering that the team possesses
the defending NCAA champion and

twelve—time Division III All-
American in senior David Olson, as
well as junior Jim Dunlevy, last
year's Most Improved swimmer and
defending Atlantic States champion in
the 1650-meter freestyle event.

Add to this two more All-
Americans, sophomores Chip Nord-

hoff and Jay Smith. Smith is also the-

defending ASC champion in the 100-

on defense, and Herrick, Morgan,
junior Tomas Perez, and freshman
Scott Strader on offense, each of
whom had two goals’. According to
Davis, W&L possibly hurt its chances
against Slippery Rock with such a
good effort against Brown, because
two hours after losing to Brown the
Generals had to play again.

After such a dispiriting loss, play-
ing Sunday for seventh place in the
tournament might have had little
allure for Washington and Lee, as
they lost to Iona 8-5.

Once again, the Generals played a
strong first half, only to lose their
intensity, and the game after halftime.

meter freestyle and 100-meter back-
stroke. Smith was named by the D-

III coaches as an academic All- J

American.

Despite all these achievements,
Remillard still sees room for im-
provement.

“I think  we would like to
improve our win-loss record, and I
think we’d also like to take eight
guys back to the nationals and pos-
sibly improve our finish there,” he
said.

As for right now, both Hatfield
and Rerriillard are busy assessing the
teams‘ performances and getting a
chance to evaluate the freshmen.

“It's time to assess the teams’
positions on a group and individual
basis and then work from there,”
said Hatfield.“So far, the indicators
are very positive.”

And those indicators proved true
Wednesday night as the teams opened ,
their 1989-90 season in the Cy
Twombly Pool. The women defeated
ODAC rival Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College by a score 143-31.
The men defeated cross-town rival

time to Iona’s seven.

“After a game like Slippery Rock,
its tough to get up for another
game,” said Davis. “We went flat in
the second half — I don’t know »
why.” ,

However, the team deserves a lot
of credit for playing better than they
were expected to this season, after
they lost over 75 percent of their
scoring to graduation.

While Remillard cautions that the
team is losing a “great goaltender in
David Olson” and a lot of leadership

‘Look Who’s Talking’

Movie fails to meet hopes

T By Todd Peppers
I Staff Reporter

_ “Look Whose Talking,” the new
_John Travolta-Kirstie Alley movie, is
‘a classic example of a film that did

‘not, or more precisely could not, live

;up to its hype.
The hype did not spring from

f gaudy press releases or tantalizing
f sneak previews, but was instead in-
fflated by word of mouth. For the last
Iweek I have heard the same question
fover, and over, and over again:
I “Have you seen the new movie

‘Look Whose Talking’? It is-----.”
(You can fill in .the blank, the
popular word choices are “awesome,
wonderful, hysterical, or amazing”)
I went into the movie expecting to
see something that would reduce me
to tears of laughter. The movie
didn‘t.

To be honest I don't know how,
after the build-up my friends gave the
movie, my reaction could have been
anything but a sense of disappoint-
ment--there was no way for the ﬁlm
to overcome my false expectations.
The word “awesome” didn’t come to
mind as the ﬁnal credits rolled.

I left the theater grumbling and
depressed. I wanted to see a movie
that would forever change society's
deﬁnition of ‘ ‘entertainment. ’ ’

After further reflection, I came to
the conclusion that my initial assess-
ment of “Look Whose Talking” was
"biased. The ﬁlm is amusing. It
won’t change your life by providing
a deep philosophical message, but
.most people--myself included--don’t
usually go to the State Theater in
search of life’s answers.

The ﬁlm is cute. Not clever.
Not droll. Not revolutionary. Not
uproarious. The perfect word is
“cute.” “Look Whose Talking” is
not only a “feel good movie,” but it
might even make some party-hard
undergrads start pining for their own
little babies. I said might.

Various movie critics have written
that “Look Whose Talking” signals
John Travolta’s triumphant return to
the big screen. I agree. Travolta,
who ﬁrst burst onto the Hollywood
scene with “Saturday Night Fever,”
“Grease,” and “Urban Cowboy,”

has recently earned the title of box
ofﬁce poison.

His last film, “Perfect,” was lam-
basted by both film reviewers and
moviegoers. “Look Whose Talking”
will silence those Hollywood doubters
who claim that John Travolta’s career
is dead.

Teamed with John Travolta is
“Cheers" actress Kirstie Alley. I
must want you that my feelings to-
ward Miss Alley are not unlike my
approach to this ﬁlm: I unfortunately
have some preconceived notions about
her. I don't think that Alley is untal-
ented. But she doesn't really stretch
her dramatic skills in “Look Whose
Talking.”

Once again she plays a ﬁercely
independent, career—oriented women
that initially butts heads with an
opinionated and/or strong leading
man. Eventually, Alley’s character
will mellow and discover that she
was too cruel to her boss, or her
boyfriend, or her lover.

I am not supporting this stereo-
type, but rather growing irritated by
it. If you think I’m exaggerating, then
rent “Star Trek II” and watch Al-
ley’s performance as a ﬁercely inde-
pendent Romulan. Or see the movie
“Shoot to Kill" in which Alley
places a rough and capable mountain
guide. Or watch “Cheers” and
notice how each week Ted Danson
and Alley exchange endless verbal
abuse. They might all be believable
characters, however the word “origi-
nal” is not the most appropriate word
to describe Alley’s career.

Kirstie Alley is cast in the role of
Mollie, a C.P.A. who is having an
affair with her married client. Veter-
an actor George Segal plays the role
of the weak-willed Albert. He keeps
promising Mollie that divorce is
around the comer as soon as his wife
makes it through therapy. The only
problem: Albert’s wife is in her sev-
enteenth year of therapy.

When Alley becomes pregnant,
Albert cannot offer her support be-
cause he is going through a “selﬁsh
phase.”

The plot thickens when Mollie
suddenly goes into labor while shop-
ping. She is alone and is forced to
hail a taxi. Enter John Travolta. He

plays James, a New York cabby and
part-time flying instructor. When
Travolta walked onto the screen I
was prepared to accuse him, along
with Alley, of simply playing another
variation of the same tired character.
My pen was poised to scribble “ty-
pe-casting” across my notepad. I
never had the chance. Absent are the
“sweat-hogs,” the greased hair, 01-
ivia Newton-John, and the white suit.

Travolta’s portrayal of James is
believable and, at times, touching.
Granted director Amy Heckering
manages to sneak in the mandatory
Travolta dance scene, yet even cynics
will enjoy both Travolta’s new dance
steps AND his young dance partner.

Alley and Travolta make it to the
hospital, and we are introduced to the
character that carries the ﬁlm--
Mollie’s baby Mikey. The baby is
played by a variety of child actors
that all enchant the audience with
their cuteness. But the credit goes to
actor Bruce Willis who is baby
Mikey's “voice.” Whether you
loved “Moon1ighting” or hated “Die
Har ,” you will be a Bruce Willis
fan before the ﬁlm is over.

Every line that Willis utters is
pure magic. But even more telling,
Mikey’s reaction to the confusing
adult world does strike some chords.
Mikey is absolutely right when he
remarks that being born is the
“weirdest thing” that can happen to
a person.

When Mikey’s Grandmother leans
over and begins to jabber in that
horribly annoying baby talk, (a sin
we are allguilty of doing) Mikey
stares in disbelief and remarks “On
yeah, she’s gone.” I wish that we
heard more from Mikey and less
from the frantic Mollie.

The movie's plot centers around
Mollie’s determination to ﬁnd a prop-
er daddy for Mikey. You can guess
who that daddy will ultimately be.
Mollie’s search culminates in what I
think is the ﬁlm's most poignant
scene. James is forced to say good-
bye (permanently?) to Mikey. As he
stands over the crib, James offers
Mikey advice for the future and talks
about his father. “I could have been
a good father” he tells Mikey, but
instead the shallow and thoughtless

Albert appears destined to assume
that role.

Travolta’s restrained, yet emotion-
ally-charged, acting in this scene
convinced me that he has certainly
matured as an actor.

The ﬁlm is supported by an im-
pressive array of character actors.
Oscar—winner Olympia Dukakis is
cast as Kirstie Alley’s mother, Rosie.
Dukakis is a busy lady, she also
appears in the new movie “Dad" and
the upcoming movie “Steel Magno-
lias.”

Rosie thinks that love is some-
thing one can walk out in the street
and ﬁnd. Rosie married her husband
because he looked good in his army
uniform. There are several funny
scenes between Dukakis and Alley--
due mainly to Dukakis’ remarkable
ability to become her characters. And
Abe Vigoda, who was the stoic “Fis-
h" on “Barney Miller," proves that
he is alive and well as he plays
James’ senile Grandfather. Where
has Vigoda been for the last ten
years?

And, as mentioned before, George
Segal is the philandering Albert.
Segal is well-cast as the immoral
executive who thinks a perpetual mid-
life crisis, and a good therapist, can
explain away any indiscretions.

As I mentioned in the outset of
he article, I was disappointed in the
film. But that was more the fault of
ny listening to hype than any flaw in
he movie. John Travolta puts in a
"me performance, Kirstie Alley does
rer usual steady but unoriginal job,
and Bruce Willis was, in a word,
priceless.

When you are home over Thanks-
giving and start tiring of Mom's
turkey sandwiches, then grab your
coat, pull your little brother away
from the television, and go see
“Look Whose Talking.”

Peppers grades it a B+. You can
earn the title of “honorary movie
reviewer" if you ﬁgure out which
actress plays the voice of Mikey’s
little sister. She only has one line,
so listen carefully.

“Look Whose Talking” is rated
“P.G.-13” for rough language and
mild sexual content. It is currently
