VOLUME 89, NO. 20

David Howison, dean of student
affairs at St. Lawrence University,
has been named Washington and
Lee’s next dean of students.

“Dean Howison brings to Wash-
ington and Lee a wealth of experi-
ence in working with students,” said
President John Wilson. “We are all
gratified to learn that he has accepted
our invitation."

Howison will replace Lewis John,
who will begin teaching full-time.

Howison, who has been at St.
Lawrence since 1968, said he decided
to leave the New York university

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

because of the nature of Washington
and Lee.

“There are very few schools in
the U.S. that could convince me to
leave St. Lawrence," Howison said.
“But this is an opportunity I am
excited to accept.”

Howison, who is a member of the
Sigma Chi Fraternity and an alumnus
of Ohio Wesleyan, said he is a strong
supporter of the fraternity system.

“At every institution I’ve been
involved with, I've seen the positive
aspects of fraternities,” Howison said.
“I’m committed to the system, as is
W&L.”

Wilson said Howison played an
important role in St. Lawrence’s
program to improve fraternity life.

“He has a full appreciation of the
fraternity system and will be an ac-
tive ally for students and alumni,”
said Wilson. “He is enthusiastic
about our decision to renovate the
fraternities."

St. Lawrence Student Body Vice
President Ramsey Goodrich said
Howison is pro-fratemity. “He sup-
ports the fraternity system in every
way.”

Goodrich said Howison is also a
fantastic administrator.

“He is in touch with the
students,” added Goodrich. “He is
not just in the administration build-
ing, but out on the campus.”

Wilson said after he met How-
ison, he was not surprised to learn

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

St. Lawrence’s Howison to succee

the search committee unanimously
recommended Howison for the vacan-
cy. He described Howison as calm,
measured and intelligent. “He thinks
before he speaks._”

“He has a great deal of experi-
ence,” continued Wilson. “His values
have been shaped in institutions with
similar commitments as ours.”

Howison said he is honored and
proud to join the’Washington and Lee
administration.

“Everyone I met at W&L was
first rate,” Howison said. “I was
tremendously impressed. The quality
of academics and the tradition make
it very special.”

Howison earned a bachelor’s de-
gree at Ohio Wesleyan, a master’s at

Miami University and a doctorate in
education at Indiana University. He
served as residence hall director and
freshman advisor at Miami University
for three years before he joined St.
Lawrence.

Howison, who has taught several
courses in Sports Culture, said he has
noticed parallels between the athletic
programs at St. Lawrence and W&L.

“Sports are critical to a liberal
education,” said Howison. “At both
schools, athletics and student support
are essential.”

Howison, who has two teenage
children, said he is not sure when he
and his family will move to Lexing-
ton, but he is “looking forward to
coming South."

The Washington and Lee faculty
Monday voted down a proposal to
give the Panhellenic Association full
voting privileges on the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

SAC, according to the Student
Handbook, has “authority for all non-
curricular matters affecting student
life” at W&L.

PHC had proposed that a fourth
faculty member be added to the com-
mittee, andthat two of the faculty
members be elected every other year
to two—year terms.

Under the present format, one
SAC faculty member is elected each
year for a three-year term.

The committee is currently chaired
by Dean of Students Lewis John. The
other members are Associate Dean of
Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins,
Prof. Robert de Maria, Prof. Kathy
Koberstein, Prof. Lisa Alty, EC Presi-
dent Willard Dumas, Interfratemity
Council President Kevin Nash, Stu-
dent Conduct Committee President

Counselor Mary Alice McM0rrow,
and Student Bar Association President
John Falk.

of W&L‘s undergraduate women, is

New zoning law may take effect July 1

By Chuck Broll
Staff Reporter

Any Lexington landlord whose tennants
include more than four unrelated persons will
have to meet more stringent rules and will need
a conditional use by July 1, the Lexington
Plarming Commission voted last week.

The new restrictions,, which must be ap-
proved by City Council, limit residents to three
convictions for noise and litter violations an-
nually. The new rules would also require land-
logds to provide “deﬁned and surfaced” park-
ing and to give neighbors their tennants’ names
and information about their vehicles.

The new rules, if approved by council, will
apply only to houses with five to eight stu-

dents, since the commission decided on a limit
of no more than eight students living in the
same residence. The permits would be reviewed
every five years, at which time the commission
could deny renewal.

The commission said police convictions, not
complaints, would apply for a 12-month period,
beginning June 1 every year. In houses receiv-
ing more than three police convictions in one
year, the “extra” students allowed under the
conditional use permit might be evicted and the
permit would be “subject to revocation” by
the commission.

Comments favoring the new rules were
voiced by Susan LaRue, co—chairman of Thresh-
old, and City Council member A.C. “Sonny”
Jordan at a Feb. 15 commission meeting.

“Our concern is these are houses that were

Wilson considers request
for list of student cars

By James Lake
Asociate Editor

Washington and Lee President John Wilson
said he is still considering how the school will
respond to Lexington’s latest effort to students
for owning automobiles.

Wilson last month received a letter from
City Manager Joseph King, asking for a list of
students who own cars. King wants the list so
Commissioner of Revenue Courtney Baker can
more easily collect Lexington’s personal proper-
ty tax.

“There are a number of things I want to
take fully into account,” Wilson said. On the
one hand, W&L does not want to be accused of
obstructing the city’s efforts to collect a lawful
tax. But, Wilson said, “There are many nega-
tive factors associated with [collecting the
tax].”

Among those factors, Wilson said, are
worries that collecting the tax would encourage

Law Students examine tax issue
 see page 4

students to live in the county or to refuse to
register their cars with the university.

Also, Wilson said the school doesn't “want
to violate the understanding we have with
students about how their records are kept."

According to W&L‘s Student Handbook,
federal law allows schools to release only
“directory information” from a student's files
without his permission. That includes a stu-
dent’s address, telephone number, place of birth,
major, activities, degrees awarded and, in the
case of athletes, height and weight.

Under normal circumstances, only the stu-
dent and a school employee “who has a legiti-
mate interest in reviewing such materials” can
have access to additional information, the
handbook says.

families. They have now been bought and
renovated to house W&L students," LaRue
said. She said her hope was that the new
restrictions would help to make the tennants
become “good neighbors.” H

Jordan, asking the commission if they had
driven through the “Diamond Hill” area recent-
ly, then asked the commission if they would
like to have any of the large student residen-
ces as their neighbors. Jordan was given a
“no” reply by many commission members.

Jordan said the buying up of the residences
on Diamond, Randolph and Massie Streets has
forced many low—income families to move to
Willow Springs, where they are now on wel-
fare because of excess travel expenses between
Lexington and Willow Springs.

Hearing set
for Master Plan

Approval of Washington and Lee’s
Master Plan is “in the ﬁnal stages”
City Manager Joe King said at the Plan-
ning Commission meeting last week.

The commission and City Council
have set a joint public hearing on the
zoning issues for 8 pm. on March 29.

But King said legal work has not
begun for consideration of whether the
city should extend W&L‘s institutional
zone to include the fraternity houses.

OPINION

FD: less spending,
more headaches

Once again, ’tis the Fancy Dress season. (It’s always easy
to tell when ’tis the season, because students look a lot more
well-groomed at parties than ususal). With the season comes
the budgeting and accounting headache for the Student
Activities Board treasurer and FD auditor.

Last year, as we all know, was a financial disaster. First,
the decorations chairmen were assigned, rather than chosen.
People who showed more than a casual interest in a certain
arena of the big or little gym were made chairmen. They
were given no budget. They were not made to order
anything ahead of time, although they were advised to do so.

As a result, many things were bought as they were
needed — on the SAB’s charge accounts. It was amazing
how almost every establishment in Rockbridge County was
signed up for an SAB charge. If you needed something, you
didn’t ask anyone if you could go purchase it; you didn’t
tell anyone you were going to purchase it; you just went.

Last year no one was in charge of the accounting, so
eventually people who were sent on errands just threw
receipts away. It was thus not at all surprising that when fall
came bills for untold amounts were still pouring in.

This year the situation was reversed. The decorations
chairmen were made to apply for the positions. Each
chairman was given a strict budget. Each chairman had to
order everything he could before Christmas vacation.
Decorations had to be ordered by section so budgets could
be kept within each section.

And, there are no charges. Despite the good relsults the
Executive Committee expected from this policy, it is
somewhat of a mixed blessing for those involved in the
practical aspects of decorating for a $69,000 party.

Here’s the problem: checks are written twice a week, on
Tuesdays and Fridays. This leaves little leeway when having
to run to Wal-Mart for last-minute items that couldn’t be
ordered. Or, try explaining to a supplier that you need it to
be sent today but could they please wait a couple of days
for the check to be written.

This also presents the logistical problem of knowing how
much you need the check to be written for before leaving
for the store. This entails going to the stores, pricing each
item, and then going back to the store when the check is
written.

Neither system is perfect. The former encourages liberal
spending; the latter results in frustrated decorations chairmen.

One alternative that could be considered is a purchase
order system, which would require students to submit
purchase requests in advance, including rough estimates of
the items’ costs. This would allow for proper accounting on
the part of the SAB, as well as ﬂexibility in buying on the
part of the decorations chairmen. Also, place one person in
charge of the ﬁnances, someone who knows each chairman’s
budget well enough to issue purchase orders within each
budget. That’s the way to stay within the budget.

Next year’s FD auditing is apt to be better still than this
year’s. Each year we learn from our mistakes; hopefully this
year will be no different.

‘My View’ policy

As the editors of a student newspaper, we feel an
obligation to publish every student-opinion piece we receive,
and we encourage students and others in the W&L
community to submit letters or “My Views.” Submissions
should be made on an IBM-compatible disk, if possible, and
must be in our office, Room 208 of the University Center,
by noon on Tuesday to appear in that week’s edition.

In addition to the work of W&L students, when space
permits, we occasionally publish as “My Views” columns
from syndicates or other newspapers in an effort to present a
variety of viewpoints on the issues of the day. However, the
appearance of a “My View,” regardless of its source, does
not indicate an endorsement of its views by the editors.

The Phi is indeed our newspaper, but it is no more ours
than it is yours. The quality and diversity of its opinion page
are dependent on your submissions.

MY VIEW
By Alan Heinrich

The recent election of Violeta Chamorro’s UNO
coalition in Nicaragua — ﬁnanced to the tune of
$20 million by the U.S. government — is the latest
chapter in the U.S. govemment’s immoral inter-
ference in that country. From the early days of
“gunboat diplomacy” and marine invasions to its
institutionalization of the treacherous Nicaraguan
national guard and the empowerment of Anastasio
Somoza Sr. to its active support and morally-
oblivious ﬁnancing of the dictator’s murderous
regime, the United States has proven itself to have
nothing remotely resembling a morally sound basis
for its latest endeavors in Nicaragua.

Despite the enormous suffering of the Nic-
araguan people, despite the unabashed corruption of
Anastasio Sr.’s heir, Anastasio Jr., who once
boasted “Nicaragua is my farm,” despite the
brutality of the Nicaraguan national guard, which
routinely tortured men, women, children and the
elderly, and treated the American TV audience to

ii 'n\\‘\,‘ I
~" it < \\l.l<»\ ’ 
"-‘"29 I'll; \‘ \  i /"

the murder of ABC newsman Bill Stewart on live
television, the U.S. government clung insistently to
the Somoza regime.

Even in the final moments of the murderer’s
rule, the Carter administration pressured the Inter-
national Monetary Fund for a $66 million loan for
the tyrant. Faced with a population largely illiterate
and greatly malnourished, suffering from a devas-
tating earthquake and cut off from the swift and
effective channels of U.S. aid that characterized
Somoza‘s U.S. relations, the Sandinistas defaulted
on the $1.5 billion debt Somoza left behind. This
precipitated Washington’s anti-Sandinista obsession,
fueled with the rhetoric of anti-communism —
despite the fact that according to U.S. government
sources‘ themselves, the FSLN received more
support from Mexico, Venezuela and Costa Rica
than from Cuba.

Reagan wasted no time in initiating his eco-
nomic war as well as his Contra war, enlisting
many ex-Somoza officers under the leadership of
the Somocista Enrique Bermudez. Not surprisingly,
economic collapse resulted. This collapse — the
result of U.S. policy, not Sandinista mismanage-
ment — was responsible for the election of Charn—

orro’s coalition.

It is painfully ironic that the leaders of the
United States, a nation with its very origin in
revolution, should be ignorant of the nature of
revolutions today. Cuba did not “export” revolu-
tion to Nicaragua, nor have the Sandinistas ex-
ported revolution to El Salvador — revolutions have
indigenous causes, such as poverty, injustice and
political oppression. To speak of Central American
revolutions as needing an exporter, given the social
realities of the region, is nothing short of an insult
to the human spirit and a betrayal of the United
States’ own philosophical foundation.

In Central America, with its vast social inequal-
ity, revolution is logically synonymous with democ-
racy: democracy is only truly possible in a country
with a relatively equal distribution of power and
wealth.

Let's hope that the Charnorro government
proves to be different than the other U.S.- backed
governments of Central America, past and present,
which have been fundamentally counter-revolution-
ary, and recognizes that a democratic government
must be for, of, and by the people, and not the
protectorate for the privileges of the elite.

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

On an important day in Washing-
ton and Lee history, sometime in the
distant past, General Lee was so
bored that he called his faithful horse,
Traveller, and other campus authori-
ties together to discuss great works of
American literature. The meeting
went smoothly until Traveller became
so disgusted with Stonewall Jackson’s
analysis of The Scarlet Letter that he
spit his oats onto the carpet and
threatened to leave the university and
get a job pulling buggies around
Lexington with the tourist bureau. To
prevent this argument from becoming
physically violent, Lee tactfully
changed the subject.

Lee: Whoa, Traveller, why don’t
you relax. It’s only a book. And you,
Stonewall, shut up already about the
Scarlet “A.” Listen, we need to
invent some grandiose campus that
even the students can enjoy. Do
either of you Civil War has-beens
have any suggestions?

Traveller: I’ve got an idea. Why
don’t we pay tribute to the sun on
the first day of spring. We can all
drink the nectar of Bacchus, god of
California wine, and dance around

Sociology student defends fraternity survey

I wish to take this opportunity to apologize
for any misunderstanding that might have come
out of my Sociology 280 study on the Greek
system. Unfortunately, many people have
approached me in defense of the fraternity system
as if the purpose of my survey was to discredit
the fraternities of Washington and Lee.

For one, this survey was not specifically
aimed at fraternities at W&L. Also, I find it
interesting that only men who are involved in the
Greek system have found it necessary to
complain. Even though the survey is aimed to
extract information about sororities as well, the
women do not find it a personal attack.

‘ I in no way wish to attack the fraternities or

naked in the woods.

Lee: Good idea but it’s a bit too
pagan. Don't forget I’m a Christian.
Tliey’ll never name a chapel after me
if I sanction paganism!

Stonewall: I’ve got a better idea.
Why don’t we have a big formal
dance in the gym with two live
bands. The students can dress up in
fashionable uncomfortable clothing,
eat dinner at expensive restaurants
and get stinking drunk. We’ll even
encourage the female participants to
spend long hours in between songs
and conversations in the bathrooms
doing God knows what.

Lee: I like the idea, but it sounds
too much like a high school Prorri.

Stonewall: Yeah, but what if we
have some dance thene like the
Trojan War, for example, and spend
thousands of dollars making the gym
look like a Trojan battlefield.
Traveller can even pull a chariot and
you can pretned that you're Achilles.
Also, we could invite the faculty and
administration and encourage them to
get as drunk as the students. We
could even have a special student
dance comrriittee.

Lee: That sounds great, but
what's the dance committee for?
Stonewall: To make sure that the
dance theme remains secret until the
week before the dance.

Lee: Okay, but what are we
gonna call this thing? Fancy Slacks?

Stonewall: How about Fancy
Dress?

Traveller: Yeah, that's perfect.

And so Fancy Dress was born.
Although Traveller trampled
Stonewall Jackson, who was dressed
up like Hector, the Trojan warrior, at
the first Fancy Dress Ball, the FD
tradition continues sucessfully into the
present. This year’s theme is
Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, and
my sources inform me that at this
very moment, as I write, the FD
studnet staff is busy decorating the
gym with objects relevant to the
novel like Gatsby’s dead body and
the green light.

For those of you who have never
read Great Gatsby cliffnotes or seen
the movie, here’s a higlily-technical
summary. Jay Gatsby, who calls
everyone “Old Sport” and grew up
dirt poor, is a wealthy bootlegger
living in New York (i.e. the
wasteland). Gatsby has purchased a
gigantic mansion and an excessive
amount of shirts in order to attract
Daisy (or is it Rhododendron), the
love of his life, who turns out to be
about as interesting as petrified wood.
Daisy’s liberal sexual attitude is
appropriately symbolized by a green
light at the end of Gatsby’s dock

sororities. The behavior patterns described in the
survey come from scholarly studies on fraternities
and sororities in the past. These were not
accusations aimed at W&L. It is also not to
suggest that this is evident in every fraternity and
sorority in the nation. The study merely attempts
to study gender roles that emerge from the
possible inﬂuence of these institutions.

Perhaps the study will indicate that the ideas,
and even biases, toward these institutions are
unfounded. I welcome any indication that this is
true. In order to prove this one way or the other,
however, the survey is necessary.

This study is in no way a liberal crusade to
wipe out sororities and fraternities on this

campus. It is also in no way sponsored by the
administration. I am simply writing a paper for
a sociology class. I realize that fraternities have
been under great scrutiny lately, which explains
in part the defensive attitude. This attitude is
understandable. I only hope that a system that is
working so hard to maintain a respectable image
on campus will have enough confidence in itself
to answer this survey honestly so that the
attitudes on this campus can be conveyed.

(had she been virtuous the light
would have been red). At the end of
the novel, Gatsby is murdered in his
swimming pool by a minor character.
The point of the novel is obvious: if
you live in the wasteland and have a
swimming pool, watch out for minor
characters who might try to murder
you.
My confidential sources have
informed me that next year’s FD
theme will be The Industrial
Revolution and that the gym will be
appropriately decorated with sulfur-
dioxide emissions and noisy factory
machines (at least we have something
to look forward to). Self-proclaimed
FD-theme specialist, Alan Herrick,
predicts that the 1992 theme will be
The Cold War (one can only guess
how the gym will be decorated for
this one).

Before I end this column, I’d just
like -to rerriind underage readers that
the consumption of alcoholic
beverages by anyone under 21 years
of age is illegal in the state of
Virginia (my probation officer said
he’d lcnock a month off of my
sentence for mentioning this fact). Of
course, Gatsby lived during
prohibition and served grain punch,
champagne and Old Milwaukee Beer
at his parties, so I wouldn’t be overly
concerned with this rule.

to classic rock _
New format coming in April to |'p'SynC

By Bob Tompkins
Staff Reporter

1

WVLI (96.7 FM) in Lexington
will be changing its music format to
:I4assic rock and expanding its listen-
ing area, according to station manager
Klan Putbrese.

i According to Putbrese, the station
has obtained permission from the
Ftderal Communications Commission
W, increase its signal from three kilo-
watts to 25 kilowatts. With that
cliange WVLI will be able to reach
listeners as far away as Staunton and
Waynesboro to the north, and Bu-
clianan to the south.

4 The station currently serves the
Rockbridge County area with an adult
contemporary format, said Putbrese.

, Putbrese said there were two
rdasons for the change in format.
First, there is no classic rock station
in the Staunton area. “We wanted to
fill the void,” said Putbrese, “there
is. no classic (rock) station now.”
Second, Putbrese said he wants to
atiract a greater listening audience
from the local colleges. Mary Bald-
win College in Staunton, Sweet Briar
Cbllege in Amherst, and Randolph
Macon Woman’s College in Lynch-
burg, will be able to receive the more
powerful signal. Washington and
Lge, VMI and Southern Sem are
within the current coverage area.

S Putbrese expects the change in
format to take place around April 15.

’ WVLI will not begin transmitting
with a more powerful signal until a

site for a new tower is approved, said
Putbrese. Putbrese said the approval
process takes about six months, but
they wanted to change to classic rock
before then so they can work out the
new format.

Putbrese said that responses to the
change have been “very positive in
Staunton and Waynesboro and among
regional advertisers, especially beer
companies." Putbrese said that clas-
sic rock generally carries a listening
audience between the ages of 18 and
49, and those listeners are primarily
male.

WVLI is considering a site on the
Blue Ridge for its new transmitting
tower, said Putbrese. The tower will
be about 250 feet tall.‘ .,Right now
the station’s transmitter is near a
garbage dump north of Buena Vista,
said Putbrese. '

There are several criteria that must
be met before the new tower will be
approved, said Putbrese. The Federal
Aviation Administration must approve
the tower to make sure it will not
interfere with air traffic in the area,
and the FCC must be sure that the
transmissions will not interfere with
the quiet zone that surrounds the
Green Bank observatory in West
Virginia, Putbrese said.

The tower also must receive zon-
ing approval, said Putbrese, and have
certification that radiation levels from
the tower will be safe for animals

Time, Inc. CEO stresses role of ads

 

By Blair Simmons
Staff Reporter

Calling advertising one of the
most sought after assets America can
offer the Eastern Bloc, Time, Inc.
Chief Executive Officer Reginald
Brack, '59, said advertising is the key
to a free economy and a free press.

Advertising increases sales vol-
ume, making mass production practi-
cal and bringing down prices, Brack
said. Falling prices stimulate compe-
tition for better, cheaper products,
he said.

As advertisements increase their
promises of quality improvement,
they also implement a program of
quality control far beyond what the
government could possibly achieve,
Brack said.

“Advertising is not a science, not
a fine art, not show business,” he
said. “It is a specialized, commer-
cial form of discourse."

By pouring money into the media,
advertising liberates the press from
dependence on federal funds, freeing
it from government regulation, Brack
said.

If advertising spending were re-

duced by oriiy five percent, about 140
television stations, 175 newspapers
and 1,500 magazines would fold, he
said.

“Advertising is the most efficient
way yet found for a seller to tell a
buyer about a product," Brack said.
“One. ad in Time magazine reaches
30 million people in 200 countries
around the world.”

Brack said that he wanted to
dispel some of the myths about ad-
vertising.

He said there is an important
distinction between “bad” advertise-
merits and “deceitful” ones, calling

the latter almost extinct in the nation-
al media.

Saying that bad advertisements are
part of the system, Brack said the
fear of litigation and the need to be
competitive usually prevent adver-
tisers from being intentionally decep-
tive. .

Brack said he is leaving the
United States next week to do market
research in the Eastern Block.
Spreading information and knowledge
is the first priority over there, said
Brack, and the American media is
trying to help them privatize their
press.

Why applaud Capt. Linda Bray?

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

Since the Panamanian invasion and Noriega’s
capture, discussion of Operation Just Cause has not
centered on Noriega; in fact, he has not been
mentioned much at all. Instead, the press chose to
create a feminist heroine, Capt. Linda Bray, and in
doing so, re-opened debate on whether women
should be allowed to defend our nation in military
conflict. Ironically, we in Lexington find ourselves
at the center of this conﬂict, not because of our
proximity to Panama, but because the feminists
have chosen Virginia Military Institute as an
appropriate follow-up to their successful conquest
of a dog kennel.

Last week, The Ring-tum Phi chose to reprint
an editorial that appeared in another collegiate
newspaper. This is an unusual occurrence for our
school newspaper. Either The Ring—lum Phi staff
was too busy publishing the Fancy Dress supple-
ment to write their own editorial, or someone
believed that the editorial offered a unique and
compelling argument for allowing women to fight
in combat. Due to the quality of the last week's
issue and the article’s weakness, the decision to
reprint it must have been primarily due to time
restraints on the editorial board; it could not have
been for any other reason, because the article

offered nothing but an exercise in fallacious rea-

soning and feminist rhetoric.

In her column, Mary Jo Dumiington stated that
women should be admitted to the front lines in the
interest of “gender equality." The article admitted
that Capt. Bray’s contributions to the conflict were,
at best, clouded. More recent reports describe an
Army cover-up of women refusing to obey orders,
of their emotional breakdowns, and even of Capt.

 

In wars past, men were not
sent to the front lines for
any other reason than than
they were men. We do not
honor their physical
strength.

Bray’s most glorious victory — arriving at a
deserted dog kennel. The article in last week's Phi
concluded that Capt. Bray’s accomplishments were
not due to any military achievement, but because
the press referred to her as a soldier, and not a
woman. In past wars, have soldiers who captured
positions vacated by the enemy, failed to obey
orders, or undergone emotional breakdowns during
conﬂict received such attention? Of course not. The
only reason that Capt. Bray received any attention
whatsoever was because she is a woman.

Those who cite the events in Panama as a step
toward “gender equality" within the military are
only fooling themselves. There is no question that
male soldiers have failed to obey orders, suffered
emotional breakdowns in the heat of conﬂict, and
even captured abandoned enemy territory. It proba-
bly even occurred in Panama. But the American
public does not hear about it, and those soldiers do
not have their picture on the cover of People or,
any other magazine. The issue of women in the
military has not opened up any question of “gen-i
der equality,” but that of gender inequality.

But, since when has gender equality had any-
thing to do with war? Men have never been sent
to the front lines merely on the basis of physical
ability. They were sent because they were men.
There are a great many strong and able—bodied men
in our Army. Were the United States to reinstitute

the draft, it is a fair assumption that there would
be a great many weak and ill-suited men within
the military ranks as well. In wars past, those men
sent to the front lines were not sent because they
could do a certain number of push—ups, run a given
number of miles, or for any other reason except
that they were men. We do not honor their physi-
cal strength. They fought for their country; they
fought for the right to raise their families in a free
nation; they fought for the rights of their mothers,
sisters, daughters, and wives to enjoy equality.
They did not fight for women to become men.

At no other point in Western civilization has a
nation considered military service either a right of
its people, or a privilege. It is, and will remain, a
duty. Those calling for women’s placement on the
front lines in no way promote gender equality.
Aside from the obvious distinctions that are already
present in our military for women, they also
establish a potentially moral precedent: If we are
to place only those women on the front lines who
are physically capable of doing so, why shouldn't
we do the same for men? Furthermore, if we allow
only those women to fight who so desire, why
should we not obligate only those men who also
desire to fight?

If our nation is to defend itself in time of peril,
then Mary Jo Dunnington’s argument would not
establish anything but a far greater gender inequali-
ty than now presently exists.

If we as a nation are to follow Mary Jo Dun-
nington’s suggestion that military service be dele-
gated only to those who wish to fight and those
who are capable of doing so, not only is our
military in grave danger, but the nation it is
intended to protect and the freedoms it upholds.

SBA releases car-tax analysis EC

By James Lake
Associate Editor

Student Bar Association President
John Falk has released an “issue
brief” that discusses the thinking
behind Lexington’s move to collect a
personal property tax on student cars.

The key issue concerning the tax,
the brief says, is whether student cars
are normally “garaged” or “parket ”
in Lexington.

“All students should first evalu-
ate whether or not they maintain an
automobile in the City of Lexington
for more than six months in any
calendar year,” the brief advises.

Those who don’t probably do not
have to worry about the tax, accord-
ing to the brief. Those who do need
to find out whether the owner of the
car is currently paying a personal

property tax on it.

The brief next divides students
according to whether they are “in-
statc” or “out—of-state."

“The law is clear,” Falk said. If
the city can establish that a vehicle is
primarily kept in Lexington, the
owner will probably be subject to the
tax, although he may be able to
obtain a refund later, he said.

Students from Virginia may pay
the tax, provide proof of having paid
elsewhere and request a complete
refund. Virginians who do not volun-
tarily pay the tax but receive a bill
from the city should check to see if
their cars were assessed properly, the
brief advises.

Lexington City Manager Joseph
King has said the city may try to re-
fund only the difference between the
two taxcs, but the SBA brief says
case law does not appear to support

that idea. In fact, a 1976 case, Ar-
lington County v. Stull, “supports the
opposite conclusion, that personal
property such as an automobile will
be taxed in only one Virginia locali-
ty,” the brief says.

For students not from Virginia,
the law provides a “non-resident
exemption” that means students who
can show they pay property tax else-
where do not have to pay it in Lex-
ington. Those students may want to
simply tell the city that they are not
required to pay, the brief advises.

But out-of-state students whose
cars are not taxed as personal proper-
ty “will in all likelihood be required
to submit to the tax,” according to
the brief.

Falk added that students who
register to vote in Lexington and own
a car are very likely to have to pay
the tax.

, From W&L Sports Information

Jeff Stickley, the man who’s seen
, Washington and Lee baseball fortunes

improve with every season he’s been
‘at the helm, is reduced to stand—up
comedy to deal with his 1990 team.

‘With his team decimated by gradua-

4tion and filled with inexperience,
what else can you do but laugh?
“We have such a young team,”
,the fourth-year head coach says,
“that when we go on road trips, l’ll
“have to stop and get them baby food
,and apple juice.”
Indeed, the 1990 edition of the
lWashington and Lee baseball team
will be very young and inexperi-
enced. Only eight of the twenty-five
‘players on the pre-season roster are
4 juniors or seniors, and only a few of
those are provenperforrners. But the
pyouth of the team hasn’t discouraged
Stickley.

.for third in the Old Dominion Athlet-
ic Conference last season, are picked

,doubt because of graduation.

veritable death-trap for opponents,
winning seven and dropping only two
at home. W&L reached the semi-
finals of the ODAC tournament be-
fore falling to eventual champion
Hampden—Sydney.

Stickley makes it clear that his
1990 edition has a lot of work to do.

“We are not a very good team
right now," he said. “But we have
the potential to be as good as we
were last year.”

Last season's team, which hit .310
as a team and scored 10 runs in a
game four times, graduated nine
players, none of whom will be easy
to replace.

Outfielder Tom Skeen and catcher
Eddie Klank, the leading power hit-
ters will be sorely missed, as will
shortstop Harry Halpert, first base-
man Max Petzold and third baseman
Tony Waskiewicz. The five players
started all 20 games a year ago.
Skeen and Klank, who combined for
six home runs and 37 runs batted in,
were second-tearn All-ODAC selec-
lions.

Also gone are pitchers Mike Tem-
ple, David Holland and Chris Cun-
ningham. Designated hitter/pitcher

 

The Ring-tum Phi, March 8, 1990

Richard Grace is also gone. Grace
and Temple each registered two wins
and Grace hit .372 as the designated
hitter.

Leading the offensive returnees
will be senior second baseman and
co—captain Bobby Rimmer. Rimmer,
a second team All-ODAC player,
started every game last season while
hitting .351. Joining him will be
junior outfielder Tim Wheeler, who
hit .323, including a three-run homer
in W&L’s 18-8 win at home over
Eastern Mennonite in the ODAC
tournament.

Also returning are sophomore T.J.
Daly and senior David Smith. Both
will see time at first base and on the
mound. Daly hit .467 last season and
had a record of 1-3 as a pitcher.
Smith was second on the team with
three home runs last season.

Anchoring the pitching staff for
the Generals will be last year’s
Freshman Athlete-of-the-Year Steve
Momorella. The sophomore had a
record of 6-0 in seven starts with
three complete games and one shut-
out. Momorella got the win over
Eastern Mennonite in the ODAC
toumey.

Sophomore outfielders Brian Harp-

Youth to be served on Smith Field

er and Pete Klingelhofer will also add
valuable experience to this year’s
team. The pair combined to start 25
games last season while driving in 15
runs. Junior Chris Kavanagh will look
to take over the catching chores from
Klank.

Stickley will look to sophomores
Jason Hendricks and Toby McCoy
along with freshman Justin Denny to
contribute on the mound this season.

The ODAC, which gets tougher
every year, may be even more trouble
this year. Perennial power Lynchburg
is as strong as ever and the league's
coaches like the Hornets to win it all.
Other strong squads include Hamp-
den-Sydney, Bridgewater and new
league acquisition Virginia Wesleyan.

Youth, inexperience, uncertainty
are the watchwords for W&L baseball
this spring. But Stickley plans to
throw a few curves at those who
picked his team to finish last.

“Things might be slow at the
beginning because of our inexperi-
ence, but we could be a fine team at
the end of the season. Our goal is to
do as well as we did last season, and
I think potentially we can be that
good. But we've got to get much
better than we are now.”

By Jay Plotkln

It lasted just a bit longer than
Mike Tyson's title defense against
Michael Spinks, which lasted all of
91 seconds.

Wednesday, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team ran off the first
eight goals to defeat Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rival Randolph-
Macon 9-3 in Ashland, Va.

Senior attaekman Chris Mastro-
giovanni opened the scoring just 91
seconds into the game off a feed
from junior midﬁelder Clark Wight,
and the Generals never looked back.

Just over 30 seconds later, sopho-
more Wiemi Douoguih found junior
Mike Moseman on the man advan-
tage. Mastrogiovarmi a second goal,
from sophomore Jeff Roberts with
6:31 to play in the first quarter, and
junior Todd Garliss scored off a
Moseman feed with 1:23 to go, still
in the opening quarter.

In the second quarter, Mastro-

On a chilly Wednesday afternoon
the Washington and Lee men's
tennis team began Old Dominion
Athletic Conference play where it left
off last year, defeating arch-rival
Harnpden-Sydney 7-2.

The Generals, the pre-season
ODAC favorite, wasted no time in
dispatching the Tigers, picked to
finish second.

Defending Division III Singles
champion John Morris got the ball
rolling with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat of J. P.
Simanis. Juniors Billy Tunner and
Bill Meadows, at Nos. 2 and 3
respectively, followed Morris’s act
with straight set victories of their
own to give the Generals a 3-0 lead.
