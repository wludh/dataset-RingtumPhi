The Lexington Voting Regulations
Board is bringing voter registration to
Washington and Lee.

City Registrar Lucille Joyce will
be here Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. She’ll be at the ODK Circle
outside the Co-op if the warm weath-
er keeps up, but if temperatures drop
she'll move into the Co-op or the
University Center.

The voting board asked Joyce to
come to W&L after receiving com-

plaints from students that they were
harassed when they tried to register
to vote. According to the board's
president, Bill Stearns, the registrar
was not intentionally harassing stu-
dents. Instead, he said, she was ask-
ing the students questions to deter-
mine whether they were actually
residents of Virginia, which is re-
quired to register.

Despite what he called Joyce’s
good intentions, Steams said singling
out any group of registrants for ques-
tioning was clearly illegal.

He said Joyce no longer ques-
tions the residency status of students,

and she’s coming to W&L to make
up for any problems students may
have had in the past.

Students may be especially inter-
ested in getting a voice in city gov-
ernment because of the number of
issues before the city council which
are directly related to student life.

Speciﬁcally, city council will be
considering the approval of the W&L
Master Plan and conditional use per-
mits.

However, Stearns encourages
students to think carefully before
registering to vote here. Gaining a

FD tradition in the black

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

The Fancy Dress Ball, traditional-
ly a black-tie affair, started a new
tradition this year — the event was
run in the black.

“Conservatively speaking, we
were about $6,000 to $8,000 under
budget,” said John Hamilton, Fancy
Dress auditor. “We could end up as
much as $10,000 under budget.”

Hamilton said that not all book-
keeping is finished yet, but he will
know how far under budget the event
was by Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting, when the Fancy Dress
Committee presents its ﬁnancial re-
port.

A new system of budgeting
helped keep the Fancy Dress budget
more organized this year, said Kath-
leen Duwel, Student Activities Board
Treasurer. The Fancy Dress budget
was kept separate from the rest of the
SAB budget, making it considerably
easier to determine the bills and
revenue, she said. Last year, the

Fancy Dress budget was lumped in
with the budget for other SAB ac-
tivities.

Another vital change in the finan-
cial organization of Fancy Dress was
that there were no charge accounts
this year, Duwel said. All incidental
expenses were paid for out of a petty
cash fund, she said. Last year the
SAB could not keep track of "11 the
charges that were amassed, and it
was getting Fancy Dress bills into the
summer. The late bills greatly con-
tributed to the $22,000 deﬁcit the
SAB had last year, she said.

Also, the ball was very wisely
budgeted this year, according to Du-
wel. “We budgeted according to the
minimum income we thought we
would get from the ball,” she said.
“In the past, the committee made the
budget according to income they
thought they might get from the
ball — it was more of a stab in the
dark.”

Associate Dean of Students Leroy
“Buddy” Atkins was invaluable in
advising the committee on how to set
the budget because of his past ex-

perience with Fancy Dress, Duwell
said.

The sale of Fancy Dress memor-
abilia was» an example of the smart
budgeting, according to Duwel. “In
the budget, we counted on selling
half of the memorabilia, but we did
much better than that,” she said.

Hamilton said the ball “probably”
lost money last year. The new restric-
tions on spending helped make the
Fancy Dress Committee members
more cognizant of the need to spend
wisely, he added.

The Fancy Dress Committee spent
about $57,000, according to commit-
tee chairman Alexander Hitz. The
money paid for expenses such as
decorations, bands and printing.Hitz
said about 1,300 tickets were sold
but over 3,000 people attended the
ball. More people attended the ball
than tickets were sold because some
people get in free, he said, such as
professors and Fancy Dress workers.

The ball ran smoothly, according
to Hitz. “We had no problems," he
said/‘There were no complaints from
anybody about anything."

does have some losses, he said.

Students deﬁnitely lose a voice in
their hometown govemments, almost
definitely lose coverage under their
parents’ homeowners insurance and
possibly lose residency status in their
home state, according to Stearns.

In addition, claiming Lexington to
be your legal residency comes at a
price, local taxes.

Still, Steams said, students do
have the option of voting here for
four years and re-registering at home
after gradution. Furthermore, he said,
students can buy their own homeown-
ers’ insurance, which will vary in

Dumas elected senior rep.

By Rick Peltz

Willard Dumas, Thomas Spurgeon,
Leslie Lewis and Stephen White
brought in majorities in Monday’s
election to claim the positions of
senior Executive Committee repre-
sentative, senior class president and
senior class vice president, respective-
ly.

Dumas captured 169 of the 582
votes cast for senior EC representa-
tive; 291 seniors voted. John Fial—
cowitz faced Andrew Gaffney in
today’s run-off for the other EC seat.
Matthew Malloy was eliminated from
the race Monday. Dumas did not
wish to comment on his win.

Spurgeon captured the senior class
presidency with a comfortable mar-
gin of victory over opponent Bryan
Patterson.

Two of the senior class vice pres-
idencies will be occupied by Lewis
and White next year. John Neslage
and Cristina Robinson contended for
the third in run-off, while David
Blank and Jonathan Myer stood de-
feated.

White attributed his victory to
“the job I’ve done for the last three
years” as a class officer. He added
that he looks forward to “a couple
really good senior parties and get-
[ting] together with the junior class,”

The race for junior class presi-

The junior class vice-presidential
election yielded the only write-in

66 of the 271 votes cast for the post.

The freshman class yielded the
highest voter turnout with 354 voters.
The 708 votes cast in the 12-candi-

Washington and Lee President
John Wilson has written the City of
Lexington to say he is still consid-

city’s request for a list of student
cars.

Wilson last month received a
letter from City Manager Joseph
King, asking for a list of students’
names, addresses and automobiles.

King wants the list so the city
can more easily collect Lexington’s
personal property tax, which he says
students who live in the city and
own cars should be required to pay.

OPINION

;PHC gets balled
égfrom SAC vote

Almost since its creation, the Panhellenic Council has
Zbeen trying to achieve full representation on the Student
fAffairs Committee so that it may have representation
{equal to that of other student groups. Last week, that
:effort failed.

__ SAC is now composed of five faculty members and
administrators and five students. The students -- the
}presidents of the Interfratemity Council, the Executive
Committee, the Student Bar Association and the Student
Conduct Committee and the head dorm counselor —
{together serve as representatives of the student body.

To us, it seems only logical that PHC also should have
voting representation on SAC, since that committee is
currently voting on issues that directly affect the women’s
fraternities. Right now, the PHC has voice on all issues
and a vote — waived to PHC from IFC - only on those
issues affecting the sororities. Needless to say, this is a
cumbersome compromise.

To give the sororities equal representation, SAC moved
to give PHC representation equal to that of all other SAC
members, and to add a sixth faculty member in order to
maintain an even ratio of faculty to students.

Nevertheless, the faculty, in one afternoon, voted down
the SAC’s proposal for this minimal restructuring, even
though SAC, a committee with an administration-
appointed or faculty-elected majority, debated relevant
issues for almost six weeks before making its proposal.
The faculty apparently feared too much Greek inﬂuence
on SAC and were in general unwilling to enlarge the
committee.

But an increase from 10 to 12 is not excessive. Yes,
another faculty member would have to join the committee,
but is that really too much to ask? SAC exists so the
university and students can meet to monitor and take part
in the “co-curricular” activities of the school. W&L has
always accented the importance of developing well-
rounded individuals, and it seems odd that the faculty
would balk at continuing to support that idea.

It is true that committees such as SAC can be draining
diversions from academia for professors. But we hope that

it is not any reluctance to work with students that is
keeping the faculty from wanting to enlarge SAC. We
would like to believe that there isn’t a “not me!” attitude
among those to whom we turn for support and advice on
so many matters.

The negative votes for the proposal seem also to be
stemming from a general anti-Greek sentiment. However,
the faculty approved the colonization of the three
sororities, and it seems out of place for the faculty to
attempt to damn them now by not allowing them full
representation. Further, the social system at W&L is,
rightly or wrongly, based largely on the Greek system. It
is backwards for the faculty to attempt to attack this
reality by not allowing PHC to vote.

In actuality, however, the “Greek vote” would increase
to only about 16 percent of the entire committee’s vote.
This percentage could in no way prove to be a major
factor in swaying SAC voting — especially since the
faculty will still control selection of a SAC majority.

Also, it seems that the faculty are wrongly assuming
that the PHC and IFC are of similar stock and would vote
together on all issues, simply because they are both
“Greek.” But the two groups are vitally different in their
structures, orientations and duties, and the issues affecting
each group are incomparable. Fraternities have weekend
parties and house rules and noise violations to contend
with, while sororities need to approve occasional hotel
rentals for parties and are working to find housing.

In any case, the PHC accounts for 60 percent of the
undergraduate female population — not a negligible
amount of women with essentially the same interests.
Similar-sized interest groups are represented on SAC
without question by the head dorm counselor and
president of the Student Bar Association, so it would seem
that mere size is not the problem.

To be fair, this question of representation is extremely
complex. But that is the problem. The faculty voted it
down quickly. This issue requires a closer look and
reconsideration by the faculty. All involved should
reconsider their initial reactions and listen to the facts.

MY VIEW
By Jennifer Spreng

Sometimes when we stop and think about how
the majority of people in‘ this world live, in deca-
dent and cruel poverty, reason escapes, and out-
raged passion takes its place. When we realize to
our horror that our country has supported a dis-
gusting tyrant like Anastasio Somoza, reason eludes
us. Passion sets in, causing good people to jump
without thinking on the bandwagon of any leader
who claims to have answers.

There is much in the history of U.S. relations
with Nicaragua to indict. In his “My View”
column last week, Alan Heinrich rightly points that
out. But the Sandinista regime wasn't the answer
to Nicaragua’s problems just because the man it
overthrew, Anastasio Somoza, was a bad guy. Nic-
aragua’s revolution didn’t end in 1979 when
Somoza was overthrown; it was subverted by a
group just as heinous as those it replaced. U.S.
involvement helped the revolution in the 1970s,
and it helped complete it in the 1990s.

Painting Jimmy Carter as pro-Somoza is a gross
misrepresentation of the facts. Upon arrival in
office, Carter almost immediately stopped military
aid to Somoza. Even Henry Kissenger stated that
“the Jimmy Carter administration actively partici-
pated in the overthrow of the Somoza govem—
ment.”

Moreover, in the first two years of the San-
dinista regime, the administration gave $118
million in direct aid. This was much more than the
United States gave to Somoza. Carter also arranged
for $262 million in World Bank and Inter-Ameri-

can Development Bank loans for the regime.

The group that overthrew Somoza was a genu-
ine coalition of many ideologies. The ruling junta
included several moderates like Anturo Cruz and
Violete Chamorro. One by one democratic ideals
were betrayed. Many who became Contra leaders,
like Adolfo Calero, fought with Daniel Ortega’s
group against Somoza, but became disillusioned
with the totalitarian regime that resulted.

The Sandinistas originally promised open
elections as soon as possible after the overthrow of
Somoza. After taking power, they reneged on that
commitment until 1984. It is impossible to know
‘what the result of the elections might have been if
the main opposition candidates, Arturo Cruz and
Virgilio Godoy, had not declined to run due to
government threats, lack of media access, and
limited organizational time,

The aid from Nicaragua to insurgents in El
Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras and Ecuador is
also staggering in volume.

In 1985, Ecuador broke off diplomatic relations
with Nicaragua for “gross, inadrnissable attacks on
the dignity, sovereignty and independence" of that
country - involving terrorist attacks.

During the 1983 trial of terrorists in Costa
Rica, the defendants admitted receiving logistical
support and training from the Sandinista regime.

Since 1981, Nicaraguans have been recruiting

Nicaragua: a U.S. suces.

and training Hondurans as armed insurgents. The
Honduran government has even arrested Nicaraguan
advisors to these insurgents in Honduras.

In December 1980, El Salvadoran rebels receiv-
ing military material from the Nicaraguan govem-
ment complained that the volume of arms ship-
ments was so large that they could not assimilate
it all. A rebel leader said that in 1981 and 1982
virtually all of this unit's arms came from Nicara-
gua. Nicaraguan syrnpathizers often say that many
captured rebel weapons are of American manufac-
ture, but serial numbers show that these were
originally sent to Vietnam.

The list could go on and on.

The Sandinistas failed in many of their prom-
ises to their citizens. The government was proud of
its campaign against illiteracy, but free-lance writer
Dee Rivers Stirnpson reports that though tuition is
free, many poor children do not attend because
urtiforrns and books are not free.

In Masaya, a small city south of Managua,
Stirnpson saw a mother throwing rocks at the
Sandinista Youth office shouting “You carmot have
my boy!" A man wept in the middle of a frus-
trated uprising that “Everyone had betrayed us.
They carmot have any more of my sons! They
promised us democracy, everybody always prom-
ises democracy.”

Real wages fell 71 percent between 1979 and
1981, before all U.S. support ended, Even given
our economic boycott of the country, the United
States consumes 25 percent of all of Nicaragua’s
exports. Real income in 1985 was about the same
as it was in 1960. Maybe Nicaraguan wealth was
subverted for arms to El Salvadoran rebels.

By Thomas Brubaker

I write this arti:le in response to
Alan Heinrich’s article, “Election
Blues in Nicaragua” that appeared in
last week's Phi. Mr. Heirrrich’s article
had two main points: to lament the
recent Sandinista election loss in
Nicaragua, and to criticize U.S.
involvement in Nicaraguan affairs.

I feel compelled to provide some
facts about Nicaraguan life during
Sandinista rule, since Mr. Heinrich
failed to do so. In 1979, the
Sandinistas promised democracy, but
they delivered a decade of dogmatic
Marxism-Leninism. By 1989,
Nicaragua had become the poorest
nation in the Western Hemisphere.

ammunition shipments to communist
terrorists in El Salvador. The Soviet
Union and Cuba supplied Ortega’s
regime with over $2.5 billion per
year in military aid during the mid
1980s, and Nicaragua built up the
largest army in Central America.

The Sandinistas engineered this
economic collapse while Ortega
censored the press, and Party
members enjoyed lives of luxury. Mr.
Heinrich somehow attributes the
Nicaraguan economic failure to “the
result of U.S. policy."

I remind Mr. Heinrich that Daniel
Ortega, not Ronald Reagan, decided
to nationalize private land, destroy
coffee plantations, and wreck a once-
thriving Nicaraguan economy.

for eight years to regain freedom. Mr.
Heinrich accuses the United States
of exporting revolution when he
terms this nationalist struggle “his
[President Reagan's] Contra war.”
However, I ﬁnd it ironic that Mr.
Heinrich later rejects the idea of
“exporting revolution" by
passionately defending the principle
of indigenous revolutions arising from
oppression and poverty. He accuses
the United States of something he
asserts does not exist, and he fails to
recognize the legitimate Contra
indigenous revolution.

Mr. Heinrich attempts to take the
moral high ground and accuse the
United States of knowing what is
right for Nicaragua. He asserts that

Nicaraguan people have rejected, isn't
Mr. Heinrich guilty of the same
paternalistic attitude he accuses U.S.
policymakers of?

Mr. Heinrich questions the
judgements of the Nicaraguans in the
recent free election. I can understand
his reservations because they have
had little experience in free elections;
the Sandinistas ruled for a decade
before submitting to one. However, I
have confidence in the Nicaraguan
people. Again I ﬁnd it ironic that
such a passionate defender of
Nicaraguan nationalism, which Mr.
Heinrich claims to be, laments the
will of the people. Why is Mr.
Heinrich “Blue” when Nicaraguans
are shouting with joy?

Where do the election posters go?

MY VIEW
By Rick J. Peltz

Somewhere there must be a place where all the
campaign posters that disappear from campus get
together and have a drink and a laugh at their
candidates’ expense.

The number of posters that disappeared in this
week's election and the previous week’s campaign-
ing unfortunately exceeds a number attributable to
rain and wind. I say unfortunately because that
leaves human interference as the only remaining
option.

Senior Executive Committee Rep. David Radul-
ovic said at Monday night’s EC meeting that
Buildings and Grounds was probably responsible
for the removal of most of the posters.

He has a point. In some instances, posters
disappear in indiscriminate fashion, whole sets re-
moved from a wall and such. This seems to
indicate that someone concerned with the beautifi-
cation of our campus is choosing to remove posters

from certain places wherever they may detract from.

the homey, non—comrnercial atmosphere.

However, B&G Superintendent James Arthur
said Monday that no posters were removed by
B&G personnel unless they were, essentially, on
something white, such as columns, or doors to
most buildings.

What I find more disturbing is that many
posters are removed in seeming discriminate
fashion. Case—in-point:

I myself placed five posters on brick walkways

for a friend and candidate late at night before .

Monday's elections. Some time between 3 a.m. and
12:30 p.m. Monday, one of those posters was
removed. Some time between 12:30 p.m. and 3
p.m., three more were removed.

All four of the missing posters were in clear
view of passersby; three were in plain view of
polling places where Voting Regulations Board
representatives should have been stationed; three
were definitely removed during prime pedestrian
traffic hours; and one was removed from the
company of other posters surrounding it.

Mr. Radulovic said that B&G is probably
responsible.

However, Mr. Arthur said that B&G removed

no posters from brick walkways. Moreover, it does
not follow that B&G would discriminate one poster
from a bunch.

Some person, therefore, outside of B&G, must
have deliberately and wrongfully removed at least
one of those posters I placed, likely more, and
likely witnessed.

This is not an isolated case. In speaking with
the EC Monday night, I learned that candidates’
posters are commonly discovered missing without
explanation, and often when others around them
have not been disturbed.

I call upon the student body, the EC, and the
Voting Regulations Board to recognize that the
removal of candidates’ posters, in such an illegiti-
mate fashion as I have described, is at the very
least poor conduct in violation of the spirit of trust
that supposedly pervades W&L life, and at the
very most may be argued as an honor violation.

We cannot compromise our community of trust
in any way. Every act that violates that trust and
every witness to such an act who doesn't report it
is one more stain on W&L's armor of honor. No
one should want such a stain to be their most
lasting contribution to W&L.

The Master Plan and the condi-

issues. The Master Plan calls for the

Approval of the plan will allow

The permits are now being considered
for renewal, but their renewal is in
jeopardy.

In a recent public hearing, local
residents pointed out that the houses
could be rented to Lexington’s low

_income residents. Also, local residents

have complained about student distur-
bances of otherwise peaceful neigh-
borhoods.

If these permits aren’t renewed,
students expecting to live in these
homes will need to look for new
living arrangements next year.

The ultimate fate of the Master
Plan, the conditional use permits and
related issues that may come up in
the future lies in the hands of city
council.

Although both the plan and the
permits are now being considered by
the Planning Commission, all action
recommended by the commission
must first be approved by council.

 

TAX

from page 1

request raises several legal ques-
tions. Under federal law, according
to Wilson and the W&L Student
Handbook, schools usually are not
allowed to release information about
a student without his permission.
' Maj. Gen. John Knapp, superin-
tendent of Virginia Military
Institute, recieved a similar letter
from King, and Wilson said Knapp
has asked for, but has not yet re-
ceived, a legal opinion from Vir-
ginia Attorney General Mary Sue
Terry as to whether the schools le-
gally can turn over such a list.

Wilson also said he told King he
has other questions about the tax-
collecting effort.

The president said he is concem-
ed that turning over the information
the city wants would encourage stu-

dents to refuse to register their cars
with the university.

Also, Wilson said, he is afraid
that to comply with the city's re-
quest would encourage students to
live outside of the city and thus dis-
courage involvement in on-carnpus
activities.

Finally, Wilson said he told
King he does not think Lexington
“has taken fully into account the
fact that over 80 percent of our un-
dergraduate students come from oth-
er states” and that many of those
students pay a similar tax back
home. '

“It seems on the surface a most
unwise course to invest in a tax-col-
lecting effort with such a small
number of potentially elligible tax
payers at stake,” Wilson said.

e reported

in Rockbridge Co.

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

Rockbridge County has its first
confirmed rabies case in several
years, according to John R. Tucker, a
santarian at the Rockbridge County
Health Department.

A pony, pastured on the west side
of U.S. Route 11 between Tirnberlake
and Fairfield, was infected with ra-
bies, Tucker said.

“I don't know how it happened,”
he said. ‘‘It doesn't make sense. The
pony was confined in a ham for
several months.”

Tucker said the pony was most
likely infected by a bat, because bats
are the only animals that carry rabies
without being infected by the disease.

Also, since the only other reported
cases of rabies near Lexington have
been in Augusta County, it is unlike-
ly anotiaér kind of animal could have

4
ftriiva/ed far enough to infect the

pony, Tucker said

Rabies, which is fatal for ani-
mals, can be treat.-:‘. in humans with
a series of intermuscular shots, ac-
cording to Tucker. Rabies shots,
which have a reputation for being
extremely painful, are painful now for
a different reason, said Tucker.
“They aren’t so physically painful
anymore,” he said, “as they are

U: financially painful."

The cost of the ‘rabies vaccine,

J shots and physcians’ time totals about

$1,500 per person, according to Tuck-
er.

The disease is transmitted when
the saliva of a rabid animal passes
through the skin of a person or an-
other animal. ' '

It is improbable that someone
could get the disease from eating or
drinking something that came in
contact with an infected animal, Tu-
cker said.

Some symptoms rabid animals
have that students should watch out
for are aggressiveness and an inability
to swallow, Tucker said.

“Any change in the behavior of
your animal indicates something is
wrong, and you should get your
animal confined and take it to a
vetemarian,” Tucker said.

The Commonwealth of Virginia
requires all dogs more than six
months old to be vaccinated for ra-
bies, Tucker said. Dogs must get
their first shot at six months, an adult
shot at one year and a shot every
three years thereafter.

Every dog in Virginia must also
be licensed with the state, he added,
and it is impossible to get a license
without proof of vacination.

Cats must be vaccinated once a
year, he said.

Tucker said he hopes this is an
isolated cases of rabies. “I have no
reason to suspect that it is anything
other than isolated,” Tucker said.

SPRENG

from page 2

Mr. Heinrich describes our anti-
Sandinista policy as “counterrevolu-
tion," and therefore, wrong. If that is
accurate, _ we must agree that the
students in Tienarnrnen Square were
counterrevolutionary as well. Thus, if
we carry the logic further, we would
have to agree from his characteriza-
tion of counterrevolution that the stu-
dents in China were somehow wrong.
I'm not prepared to accept that argu-
ment. I question the entire premise.

To equate the American Revolu-
tion with the Sandinista government
is also intellectually irresponsible. I

dignify it with a response because I
do not want any naive readers to be
confused by the glamour of the argu-
ment. The American__ revolutionary,
leaders never lied about their goals,
were as democratic as possible, and
encouraged so much initial public
criticism that they had to completely
scrap their initial plan of government
and draft a new one, which they
subsequently sent to the people for
approval. The Constitution has been
copied all over the world and is
widely respected as a work of genius.

Our experience is the exception.

Revolution has a depressing habit of
going awry — as it did in France in
the 1700s, Russia in 1917, Spain in
the__1930s, and; as _r_no_s,t people now
realize it did in Nicaragua in 1979.
The Nicaraguan people ‘supported

the overthrow of Somoza, but they‘

never picked the government they got
as a result. Mrs. Chamorro may now
have the chance to bring the real
government of the people, by the
people and for the people to Nicara-
gua. If the United States participated
in the process in a positive way,
well, good for us!

A student expressed concern to the
EC at the comrnittee’s Monday night
meeting that many campaign posters
were wrongfully taken down prior to
and during elections.

Senior EC Rep. David Radulovic
proposed that Buildings and Grounds
may be removing the posters.

Buildings and Grounds Superin-
doors and columns would be re-
moved.

EC President Dumas said he
would address the concern to Goings.

Also at Monday night's meeting,

Dumas, on behalf ‘of the student
body, thanked all candidates for their
efforts.

EC Secretary Christopher Giblin
later added that “[VRB Chairman]
Wesley Goings deserves a lot of
credit for the fine job he's done.”
Giblin cited “three years of devoted
service to the VRB [and] W&L" on
Goings’ part.

In other EC business, Dumas re-
ported that two applications to the
White Book Revisions Committee
have been received from the under-
graduate campus and 10 from the

Law School. The EC extended the
deadline for applications to Monday,
March 19.

“We need people on that com-
mittee," said EC Vice President
Jonathan Sheinberg, urging more
students to apply.

Ariel Editor John Foster submitted
the publication’s budget repon. Of
$2,979.90 in original allocation and
interest, $1,193.74 was spent on the

circulation from 600 to 700. About
$536 will remain unspent.

W&L rips Ithaca for third straight win

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

Winning, or losing for that matter,
is something that can grow on a
team. For the past two seasons, the
Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse
team had losing grow on them like a
bad rash.

But recently, however, it seems
that the Generals have found the
calamine lotion and have cured the
losing rash. In defeating Ithaca Tues-
day in their home opener 13-4, W&L
extended it’s winning streak to three
games, the longest in three years.

After handling Old Dominion
Athletic Conference rival Randolph-
Macon a week ago Wednesday, the
Generals travelled up to Lancaster,
Pa. to take on Franklin and Marshall
on Fancy Dress Saturday.

Said first-year head coach Jim
Stagnitta before the trip, “The guys
are focused. They know they played
probably their worst game of the
season last year against F&M, and
they want to prove to themselves that
they could play a better game. We
are going up there to do one thing,
and that is to beat Franklin and Mar-
shall.”

Goals by senior midfielder Jim
Jones tied the game at 1-1 and fresh-
man David Schiminger, the Generals
led 2-1 with 7:30 to go in the open-
ing quarter. From there, however,
F&M scored the next three goals of
the quarter to take a 4-2 lead after
the period.

Junior gbalie Tom Costello had a
rough first quarter, giving up four

goals. Said Stagnitta, “Tornmy strug-
gled in the first quarter. He had his
worst game in college last year
against F&M, and they were letting
him know about it — jawing at him
before and during the game. But he
hung tough."

Junior middie Todd Garliss
brought the Generals to within 4-3 to
start the second quarter off an assist
from sophomore Wiemi Douoguih,
and Jones tied the game at 4-4 with
8:08 to play in the half.

After another F&M goal, junior
attaclanan Mike Moseman tied the
game for W&L at the half with his
goal 2:12 before intermission.

In the third quarter, the Generals
took control of the game. Sophomore
attackrnan Jeff Roberts scored with
12:52 left in the quarter to start the
ball rolling, and Douoguih and Mose-
man continued the roll with goals of
their own to give the Generals an 8-
5 lead heading into the final quarter.

After F&M scored to make it 8-
6, Roberts and Jones tallied the fm-
ishing blows to extend the lead to

10,-‘6. F&M got two late goals, the
last ‘with 1:16 to play, to make it a
10-8 game, but the Generals held on
for a 10-8 win over 13th ranked
F&M.

Said Stagnitta after the win, “We
beat a team that had more individual
talent than we did. We won because
we played a better team game than
they did and executed everything we
wanted to.”

Costello rebounded from his slow
start to record 20 saves, including 14
in the second half. Jones had a car-

 

eer—high three goals to lead W&L,

The Fllng-tum Phl, March 15, 1990

while Moseman had two goals and an
assist and Roberts added two goals.

Tuesday, on a sun-drenched Wil-
son Field, the Generals were red-hot
and could do no wrong in the first
half.

Senior attackrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni set the stage when he batted
a pass from junior Clark Wight into
the net just 1:50 into the game to
open the scoring.Wight scored with
11:22 left, and Jones closed the first
quarter scoring with a goal 38 sec-
onds from the end to give the Gen-
erals'a 3-0 lead.

In the second quarter, Douoguih
scored 14 seconds in and followed
that with another goal with 10:55 left
to make it 5-0. Roberts scored 32
seconds later to make it 6-0. Jones
scored his second goal with 8:17 left
and Garliss (7:25), Mastrogiovanni
(7:01) and Schirninger (1:38) finished
the first half scoring.

Mastrogiovaririi opened the third
quarter by registering his third hat
trick of the season, off Moseman’s
third assist of the day. After that,
however, the W&L offense took a
break, and Ithaca ran off thrw
straight goals, all by Bill Aldrich.

In the fourth quarter, Roberts
scored his second goal of the day,
and Douoguih followed with his third
as the Generals cruised to the 13-4
win. ,

Mastrogiovanni and Douogiiih
each scored three goals. Jones and
Roberts added two apiece. Moseman
handed out four assists and Wight
dished out two. For the season,
Moseman (4 goals-10 assists-14
points) and Mastrogiovarmi (l0-0-10)

Track lcc

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

The 1990 Washington and Lee
track and field season commences
Friday as the men try to continue
their 36 straight victories while the
women's team, only in their second
season, look to make a name for
themselves.

The Generals will host Roanoke
College, Eastern Mermonite College,
John Carroll University, and Bridge-
water College, and men's head coach
Norris Aldridge believes this will be
his tearn’s toughest challenge all year.
The action begins on the track at
3:00 p.m.

Besides the six-year unbeaten
streak, the men have accumulated
nine Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference indoor and outdoor titles in
that time. However, the same suc-
cess will not come easily as

evidenced by a second place finish to
Lynchburg at the ODAC Indoor
Championships in February. It was
the first time since 1984 the Generals
failed to win the indoor crown.

In the past, Aldridge’s teams has

Said Stagnitta, “Ithaca put a lot of senior Carlos Millan held Ithaca to

pressure on us, and we moved the
ball much better than we had been.
They were a very athletic team.”
The W&L defense, led by seniors
Reid Campbell and Mike Nunan and

ingredients to success. This year,
Aldridge acknowledged that the depth
is unproven, but claims that is still
there.

Said Aldridge, “We don’t have a
lot of proven depth. The good thing
is we have a lot of potential. That’s
going to be key, and I think it will
be even more of a key than in the
past.”

However, to ease the transition, a
group of top performers are returning
to this season’s squad. Leading that
group are the 1990 tri-captains ‘of
senior Wes Boyd, junior David Mar-
tin, and senior Phillip Sampson.
Boyd, after struggling with injury last
season, has returned strongly to top
sprinting form, winning the ODAC
60-yard dash during the indoor sea-
son.

Martin also had a fine winter
season, winning the ODAC indoor
mile with a 4:27.6 clocking. Samp-
son, who has twice won the ODAC
pole vault championship, will look to
add a third in his finalseason.

Aldridge also will look to senior
Scott Williams and junior Carl Gil-
beit for support. These two versatile
performers combined to compete in

4 ‘ The Washington and Lee base-
ball team opened the 1990 season
with five games in ﬁve days, wirming

, two and losing three.

“We are so young that I didn't
ow what to expect. So many of
'ur guys hadn’t played much be-
ore,” head coach Jeff Stickley said,
eferririg to the fact that W&L lost
‘ e players to graduation.

Z W&L opened the season with a 4-
_ loss against Holy Cross on Thurs-
yday, and was then smothered by West
‘ Virginia Tech on Friday, 11-4, before
‘coming back to sweep WVa. Tech in
‘ii doubleheader on Saturday, 15-4 and
.15-4.

, L After four straight home games,

the Generals traveled to Bridgewater

‘on Tuesday and dropped a 3-1 deci-
,sion to open the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference season.

On Thursday, with the score tied
at 2-2 in the ninth inning, Holy Cross
loaded the bases with nobody out and

#proceeded to score two runs to take

(a, 4-2 lead.

The Generals scored one run in

4 their last at bat when sophomore T.J.

‘Daly’s ground out to second brought
home freshman Mike Steinbrook. For

gthe game, sophomore outfielder Brian

‘Harper was 3-for-4 at the plate and
scored a run.

, Sophomore pitcher Steve Momor-
ella, last year's W&L Freshman Ath-
‘lete-of-the-Year, gave up four runs,
‘two in the first inning and two in the
ninth, but allowed only one hit from
Vthe second through the eighth inning
while registering eight strikeouts.

“Steve pitched a heck of a

~ game,” Stickley said. “We gave
ourselves a chance to win and that’s

(what we're looking for. The biggest .

thing for us to work on is to make
sure we score enough runs. We left
la lot of people on base.”
4 On Friday, WVa. Tech scored
four runs in both the third and sixth
‘innings on their way to an 11-4 vic-
tory. The Generals picked up three
runs in the fifth inning on back-to-
‘back doubles from junior first base-
man J.T. Swartz and junior outfielder
Tim Wheeler. Swartz was 2-for-3
with two rims scored.

“They just hit the ball better than

ASPORTS

us,” Stickley said “They smashed
it around pretty good. They deserved
to win that one.”

The first game of Satiirday’s
doubleheader against the Golden
Bears saw the Generals erupt for 15
runs as 11 different players crossed
the plate.

The second game was a bit
tighter. W&L picked up five runs in
the first two innings and held on to
win, 5-4.

“I was pretty pleased with the
way we came back to win the dou-
bleheader, especially on the day after
Fancy Dress,” Stickley said. “We
had some great pitching.”

That pitching came from senior
David Smith and sophomore Toby
McCoy. Smith won the first game
and earned a save in the second, after
McCoy had been pitching a perfect
game going into the fourth inning.
Smith also went tliree-for-six at the
plate on Saturday.

“He (Smith) was just in a groove,
he was ahead (in the count) of a lot
of hitters," Stickley said. “He’s

If you told someone in passing on
the Colonnade that the Washington
and Lee women’s lacrosse team was
going to fare well against national
powerhouse Washington College on
Tuesday, tliey' would have first called
you crazy and then reminded you that
a year ago, Washington College de-
feated the Generals 15-3.

But that was last year.

To open the 1990 campaign, the
Generals gave head coach Jan Hath-
om every reason to smile about what
this season could bring to Lexington
despite losing 12-8.

“I was really pleased with the ef-
fort. We played hard for all 50 min-
utes. I think we learned a lot from
playing a team of Washington’s cal-
iber in the first game. It was a great
learning experience that will definitely
help us during the season,” said
Hathom.

always been a good hitter. We ex-
pect him to do that, so his perform-
ance wasn't a real surprise. He’s
going to have a good year.”

At Bridgewater, three unearned
rims spelled defeat for W&L. The
loss sent the Generals’ record to 2-3
(0-1 in the ODAC). Daly went 3-for-
4 on the day. Momorella struck out
four and allowed only six hits as he
pitched his second complete game of
the season, but lost for only the
second time in his collegiate career.

“He’s pitching great. He’s our
number one pitcher and he’s going to
get the tough assignments. We just
couldn't score enough runs to help
him out,” said Stickley, noting that
W&L stranded 10 runners on base.

W&L has a full list of ODAC
games lined up. The Generals played
Eastern Mennonite today and will
play Randolph-Macon in a double-
header at Smith Field on Saturday.
Next week, W&L will host Hampden-
Sydney on Tuesday and journey to
Lynchburg on Thursday.

before junior co-captain Shawn Wert

scored with 19:15 left in the opening

period. Sophomore Kimberly Bishop

followed Wert’s goal with one of her ,
own to make it a 3-2 game, but WE

answered with two goals from Sarah

Coste, who scored the first five goals

for WC.

Bishop, last year’s leading scorer
with 25 goals, added two more first
half goals, the second with just one
second to play in the half, to keep
the Generals in the game, trailing just
7-4 at the half.

Washington College scored the
first two goals of the second half to
take a 9-4 lead before Bishop got
back into the scoring column for
W&L. Her goal with 15:25 to play
made it 9-5.

From that point, WC scored two
more unanswered goals to open up
what would prove to be an in-
surmountable 11-5 lead. The Gen-
erals made a late run to cut it to 11-
8 on goals by Bishop (7:24), Wert
(2:21) and freshman Lisa Dowling

Bishop led W&L with five goals.
Sophomores Whitney Hopkins and
Melissa Manko had assists. Sopho-
more Erica lrigersoll made 11 saves
in goal for the Generals.

Said Hathom, “We played as if
we felt we could win. The team
should be proud of how they played
after being romped last year. I think
if you take away some first game
nervousness, then this game could
have very easily been 8-8."

. Despite the fine effort, Hathom
still thinks the team has a long way
to go. “We still have a long way to

go, but if this first effort is any in-
dication, we stand a very good
chance of doing well this season.”

The Generals travel to take on Old
Dominion Athletic Conference rival
Bridgewater today and will play host
to Western Maryland Saturday on
Liberty Hall Field.

Freshman Claire Dudley, the
1990 Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Swimmer of the Year,

Anyone attending the Minority
Student Association/Ornnicron Delta
Kappa panel discussion last night
expecting a consensus of opinion was
probably disappointed. Although no
speciﬁc conclusions were reached, the
evening did shed light on the topic of
cultural diversity.

The question addressed was,
“Does the university promote or
inhibit cultural diversity?” Specific
areas such as W&L’s curriculum,
social life and admission policies
were under scrutiny.

Panelists discussing their percep-
tions of multiculturalism at W&L
were Assistant Dean of Students
Kenneth Ruscio, Minority Student
Association President James Ram-
beau, Interfratemity Council President
Kevin Nash, Executive Committee
President Willard Dumas, former
International Club President Jennifer
Spreng, Spectator Editor Paul
Legarde, and Assistant Professor of
Sociology Anne Wortham.

At first, the speakers summarized
their ideas about cultural diversity.

Dean Ruscio stressed his feelings
that diversity already exists on carn-
pus. “Greater diversity is an oppor-
tunity; not a problem,” he said. He

W&L|FE

Grappling with cultural diversit

also remarked that multiculturalism
enriches Western society, therefore,
knowing about other cultures helps us
understand our own. “We must dedi-
cate ourselves to making every person
in the W&L community feel at
home.”

James Rambeau disagreed with
this view. He feels that Washington
and Lee has not been doing nearly
enough to promote multiculturalism
because everything “tends to be seen
in black and white.” He beleives
that, while many traditions are good,
traditions that impede the success of
the University must be changed.
Rambeu said that, while the
curriculum is generally euro—centric in
content, it is slowly changing.

Willard Dumas took the same
general viewpoint. The University’s
effort in attracting culturally diverse
faculty members has disappointed
him. Dumas’ main point was that
bringing diverse students here is not
enough. Dumas feels that, once
students are here, they seem to be
isolated by the social structure of our
campus.

Kevin Nash addressed the entire
idea behind multiculturalism. “We
should not change our current cur-
riculum, but rather augment it by
offering the study of other cultures
for those who are interested.” On the
socialissue. Nash said that while

‘dent has the desire

The Rlng-tum Phl, March 15, 1990_

fraternities rriight have inhibited cul-
tural diversity in the past, that the
problem is in the process of being
corrected. He did not mention what
steps were being taken.

Tak.ing Nash's idea further, Paul
Legarde vocalized his thought that we
live in a society based upon European
ideas. “It is not surprising that Amer-
ican universities are euro-centric, and
American culture demands that they
be that way. W&L is working very
hard to bring diverse students and
professors on campus.”

Dr. Wortham, who is a new profe-
ssor at W&L, hoped that the panel
discussion would help her discern the
extent of cultural diversity on cam-
pus. She said, “Generally, I have
problems with the concept of multi-
culturalism because it tends to be
used to undermine the legitimacy of
cultural pluralism. The term should
not be used to put the intellectual
heritage of the West on the defen-
sive.” _

Wortharn believes that, because
America has a pluralistic culture all
of its own, we should strive toward
intellectual independence, instead of
multiculturalism.

Jennifer Spreng bases her view-
point on the thought that every stu-
to fit in at
Washington and Lee. “Everyone has
the right to feel good about thenisel—

ve .

Similarly to Dean Ruscio, Spreng
believes that the community as a
whole must work to promote different
cultures. “Relations between groups
at W&L are not perfect, but they
tend to be resolved with much less
acrimony than at so many other
schools,” she said.

Once each panelist had a chance
to'speak, ODK Vice-President Shawn
Copeland, who served as moderator,
opened questions to the audience.

While many issues were address-
ed, the University’s admissions and
recruitment policies were discussed in
depth. Currently, the University’s
admission process does not adhere to
any percentages (sex not included),
rather it strives for the widest diver-
sity possible. This often results in
special recruitment of minority stu-
dents. One glaring question
concerning the acceptability of this
policy seemed to remain: Should
there be a blind admissions policy?

According to Rambeau, one of the
event’s organizers, the goal of the
evening was to “promote discussion
and get a general assessment of stu-
dent opinion on the topic.”

This is the second year the panel
discussion has been conducted. Last
year's discussion followed similar
lines. Will the third?

ROTC conducts exercises with VMI

From News Releases

Operation —- Winter Warrior pitted
Washington and Lee‘s ROTC Mink
Battalion and Virginia Military
Institute’s New Market Army ROTC
Battalion seniors against the under-
classmen for three days of training
exercises in George Washington Na-
tional Forest earlier this month.

The first ever joint exercise, held
Feb. 3-5, helped prepare the third-
year cadets for Advance Camp at Ft.
Bragg, N.C., this summer, said New
Market Army cadet Chris Larlee. The
cadets were also able to put into
practice the tactics they learned on

 

 
  

the fall training exercises at Fort Lee,
N.J.

Upon reaching George Washington
National Forest Friday evening, the
Winter Warrior Platoon moved
through the’woods to the first patrol
base. From there, the platoon divided
into three different squads and con-
ducted security patrols of the area in
order to secure the perimeter, recon-
noitcr terrain, and gain information
about the enemy, the seniors from the
two units.

The long night, complicated by
little sleep and frequent frreﬁghts
with the opposing forces, came to an
abrupt end when the cadets were
awakened at 5 a.m. Both sides we-.re

ammunition. In the morning, a re cieuv
of the night’s activities was held and
the units prepared to move to the
new patrol camp.

Upon arrival at the second camp,
the squads conducted reconnaissance
patrols of an enemy base, to be
raided in the morning. The informa-
tion returned by the scouts was used
by cadet leaders to determine the
direction of attack and locations for
assault, support and security elements
for the raid. '

Completing the recon of the raid
site, the three squads joined together
for a platoon ambush of enemy for-
ces using a nearby trail. After the

ambush, the soaking-wet cadets re-
turned to the patrol base and rapidly
moved to a large tent for the evening.
There they were able to eat a hot
meal and change into dry clothes.

Movement to the raid site began
on Sunday morning at 3 a.m. Again,
the platoon had to move through the
dark, wet forest, led by cadet leaders.
The raid was short, ﬁerce and suc-
cessful.

The department of Military Art
and Leadership will hold another
exercise during Spring Term at Ft.
Bragg to further prepare for this
summer's Advance Camp.
