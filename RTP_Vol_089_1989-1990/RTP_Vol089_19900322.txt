Love Natives
grock Daytona

,f,Fiji wins national competion

By Mike Badger
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee can once again
be proud to call itself the home of a
national champion.

Two years ago the university
claimed a national championship
compliments of the men’s tennis team,
but the latest championship has come
in a slightly different arena.

Last Sunday the Fiji Love Natives,
winners of W&L’s fourth annual Lip-
Sync contest, and finalists in the na-
tionwide SAMS (Students Against
Multiple Sclerosis) “Rock—a-Like"
contest, were chosen as the top act in
the nation.

The Love Natives, one of six acts
chosen by SAMS to perform live on
MTV from Daytona Beach, were the
favorite act of viewers across the na-
tion. ~
The voting was done entirely on a
call-in basis, and when it was over the
Fijis had accumulated 31 percent of
the votes, beating the runner-up group
from the University of Missouri,
which got 28 percent of the votes, ac-
cording to Love Native Tyler Suiters.

“All the credit goes to the people
here at W&L,” said Suiters. “From
wh  heard, people were voting four
anﬁive times.”
z7""‘We couldn’t have done it without

W& ,” said Love Native Larry Par-
ker, “especially the Fij.”

Voting from the Fiji house was ex-
ceptionally strong in support of the

one.

In January they warded-off stiff
competition to win the W&L Lip Sync
contest, which raised over $2,000 for
SAMS. A tape of their act, in which
they lip-sync Morris Day and the
Tirne’s “Jungle Love”, was then sent
to New York, according to Gerald
Darrell, organizer of the contest at
W&L. There it was viewed by a panel
of SAMS judges,said Darrell, and was
selected as one of the top six acts in
the nation.

The group left W&L for Daytona on

March 15, according to Suiters, where
they trained for two days before the
final competition.

Aside from some extensive tanning
and lifting, the group had a chance to
perform their act at Daytona’s 701
club the night before Sunday’s final,
according to Suiters.

With that performance under their
belts the Love Natives felt comforta-
ble, said Suiters, and when it came
time to perform in front of the camera
they weren’t nervous at all.

“Once we saw everyone else’s acts

Native Kirk Sohonage.

“We were just anxious to get out
there and do our thing,’ ’ said Suiters.

Once their performance was over
the group knew they had done well.

. “We, felt , great, about it,”. said
Suiters. “We knew we did a great
job.”

“The girls there loved our gyrat-
ing,” said “lead singer” Jim Ambro-
sini. “The women were just throwing
themselves at us.’ ’ '

When the announcement was made
that they had won, none of the Love

Natives were particularly surprised.

“No one was going to beat us, we
knew that ” said Parker, “although we
were a little afraid of the Go-Gos [the
group from the University of Alaba-
ma], they were big and intimidating.”
“The group from Akron which didn’t
perform might have given us a run for
the money,” said Sohonage.

According to Suiters, the Akron
group was there for the competition,
but could not perform because MTV
couldn’t get the rights to their song
“Summer Lovin” from the Grease
soundtrack.

Meanwhile, the reactions back in
Lexington to the Love Native victory
were very emotional.

“The exuberance we all felt was
somewhat akin to winning the World
Series, the Superbowl and the NCAA

basketball championship all wrapped.

in one,” said Nash.

“Just the realization that we were
national champs-it was incredible,”
said Fiji pledge Matt Cook.

“Everybody was really pumped,”
added Johnson. “We were all so
proud to be Fijis.”

For the Love Natives, one of their

biggest thrills came in representing
W&L, according to Ambrosini.

“I think our victory was good for
the school,” said Ambrosini. “How
many times does a small school like
W&L get represented on national
television? ’ ’. . .

“It’s not just a victory for us,” add-
ed Suiters. “It’s a victory for the
whole school.”

The Love Natives said they also en-
joyed meeting a number of television
personalities who were in Daytona,
especially MTV V-J Julie Brown.

Washington and Lee’s Law School was
ranked 25th in a recent survey of the best law
schools in the United States, according to the
March 19 issue of U.S. News and World Report.

The 175 American Bar Association-
,, accredited schools that award J.D. degrees were

included in the survey, which picked Yale as
O the number one law school in the nation.

The survey, which was conducted by the

l Washington ofﬁce of Market Fact, Iric., and

, which included surveys of business, medical

and engineering schools in addition to schools

5 of law, were compiled for U.S. News during

  

the winter of "1989-90. Schools were ranked
based on their degree of student selectivity,
placement rates after graduation, instructional
resources available to students, and their
academic reputation among other schools and
law firms around the country.

Overall rankings were determined by
converting the scores for each attribute into
percentiles and weighting the scores
accordingly. The highest total score was labeled
a “I00,” and the other schools were ranked by

converting their scores to a percentage of the

top school's score.

Randall Bezanson, dean of the W&L Law
School,‘ said he was contacted by U.S. News
several months ago and asked to send some
objective data about the school. Bezanson said

he did not hear from U.S. News again until he
received a press release of the survey results
Friday.

Bezanson said when he was first contacted
by U.S. News he was not all that impressed by
the undertaking. Nationally, law schools are so
diverse with respect to size and structure that it
is really difficult to make comparisons, he said.

However, considering that this is the first
survey of this nature that U.S. News has
conducted, the magazine did, in his estimation,
“A pretty good job basing their evaluations on
a number of factors.”

W&L’s Law School is by far the smallest
of the institutions included in the top 25. Most
of the larger, public institutions are affiliated
with public research institutes, which enhance

their reputations, Bezanson said. Washington
and Lee warranted its rank strictly on the basis
of its own merit, he said.

The U.S. News rankings will have little
effect on admissions at W&L, Bezanson said.

“Washington and Lee’s Law School is
already widely regarded as a uniquely fine,
small law school. The survey results only
confirm this fact,” he said.

John Falk, president of the W&L Student
Bar Association, said the rankings could have
some impact on students at the law school,
particularly as they search for jobs. The study
confirms the quality of W&L and enhances
graduates’ potential for finding a job with a top
firm, he explained.

Delta Gamma National Rep-
resentatives have responded to the
Panhellenic Council of Washington
and Lee University ,by' approving a
proposal for Delta Garrirna’s coloniza-
tion and acknowledging W&L’s Delta
Gamma Interest Group, according to
Panhellenic President Nancy Mitchell.

“We’re looking forward to working

with Delta Gamma in their estab-
lishment at Washington and Lee,”
Mitchell said.

Delta Ganirna’s acceptance of the
Parihelleriic proposal enables the PHC
to acknowledge the legitimacy of the
Delta Gamma Interest Group, which
had petitioned the PHC for a voice on
the council. Vicki Nixon, Delta Ga-
mma National Director of Expansion,
agreed with the PHC that the interest
group should be allowed to have a
voice, but not a vote, on the PHC until

colonization. In response to the
group’s official acceptance by Parihel-
lenic, a DGIG representative was pre-
sent at the PHC meeting Tuesday
night. -

VMI faculty
say yes to
coeducaﬁon

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

Sixty—three percent of Virginia
Military Institute faculty members re-
sponding to a poll favored admitting
women to the all—malc school, but a
majority of them also support State
Attorney General Mary Sue Terry's
efforts to defend the single sex
policy.

According to a news release from
Blair Tumor, president of VMI’s
chapter of the American Association
of University Professors, most of the
respondents who favored admitting
women were in favor of Tcrry’s legal
battle with U.S. Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, who had set a Feb.
20 deadline for VMI to agree to
admit women or face a sex dis-
crimination lawsuit.

Several of those instructors who
favored Tcrry’s lawsuit but also fa-
vored admitting women felt that
deciding the matter in court would
“at least clarify the legal issue,”
Turner said.

Terry's suit, filed in the U.S.
district court in Richmond on Feb. 5,
claims that VMI’s exclusion of
women is constitutional under the
Education Amendments of 1972 and
the Civil Rights Act of 1964

“Admission of women to the
VMI undergraduate program is not
necessary to provide equal op-
portunities for women within the
Virginia system of higher education,”
the lawsuit said.

A similar survey was done at
Washington and Lee in 1984, before
it began admitting women. At that
time, over 65 percent of the faculty
members who responded to a poll by
a sociology class said that they “stro—
ngly believed that W&L should be-
come a coeducational institution.”

A majority of instructors at the
time believed that coeducation
“would be in the best interests of
W&L with regard to attracting aca-

Cultural diversity,
at what sacrifice?

Last Wednesday, a panel convened to discuss multi-
culturalism at Washington and Lee. Most of the panelists
« seemed to agree that the university is taking steps in the
V right direction, but there is room for improvement. James
Rambeau, president of the Minority Student Association,
said he believed the school could do more.

Dean Kenneth Ruscio, representing the university, said,
“greater diversity is an opportunity,” and “we must
dedicate ourselves to making every person in the W&L
community feel at home.”

Equally important as attracting minorities to the faculty,
"A is attracting women to the faculty. Some candidates might
be wary of the student attitudes. Others may not like
' faculty attitudes. In this case, W&L itself was the barrier
_ to attracting a woman.

‘ The journalism department has just added a new
' faculty member for next year. Toward the end of their
search, the ﬁeld of candidates had been narrowed to
four —— two men and two women. Brian Richardson
accepted the position last week. The ﬁeld of women
narrowed itself.

One of the woman candidates decided W&L and
Lexington were not for her. She preferred a larger school
3 in a larger setting. If the size of Lexington and
._ Washington and Lee frighten candidates away, what other
characteristics of the town and school might prohibit
attracting qualified people?

Should Washington and Lee hire less-qualified minority
and women candidates just to have them on the staff?
No. Should Washington and Lee diversify the perspective
of the faculty by hiring minorities and women? Yes, if
the candidate’s different perspective makes up for the lost
experience.

Much can be said for a diverse faculty, and the same
, is true of making the whole community comfortable, but
the first objective of recruiting both faculty and students
should be their potential to excel in their fields.

The Fij

On the subject of cultural diversity, the Exotic, Erotic,
Narcotic Fiji Love Natives deserve a Laurel, and Hardy
handshake for their stellar performance in Daytona Beach.
Those who say their win speaks well of the school are
right.

The Fijis say thanks

Now that we've returned from our national tour, we would like to
take this opportunity to thank everyone at Washington and Lee who
watched and voted for the Fij on Sunday. We were really quite amazed
at the number of people who said they called in for us. Some of them
are going to have some pretty big phone bills next month.

Nevertheless, it was a close contest and all your votes helped make '
the difference for us. We would have won by a bigger margin if
Sohonage thrusted in synch (just kidding, Kirk).

All in all, the trip was a total blast and intellectually stimulating, not
to mention a few other stimulations.

We were psyched to win and could not have done so without the
support from our school and feel its a victory for all of us, although
we're keeping the car.

Thanks again everyone.

Raising kids — Sbar style, 

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Lately I have been thinking about
the good old days when America’s
youth was carefree, happy, and did
not eat satanic breakfast cereal in-
volving Teen-age Mutant Ninja Tur-
tles that were spontaneously generated
from a nuclear waste plant. Yes read-
er, today’s youth are in such serious
trouble that they leave us only two
possible alternatives: either we kill
them and throw them, along with
their electronic big wheels, into the
Grand Canyon or I write a long
serious article chastising them but
offering no solutions. Since we have
neither the time nor the inclination to
haul all of America's youngsters off
to Arizona, it looks like we’d better
settle for the article.

To begin with, our elementary
school kids are really stupid. Now
back when I was in elementary
school (10 years ago), educators were
talking about how we were playing

kickball while kids in Japan were de-
signing computer chips, so everyone
agreed that we were pretty stupid.
But nowadays kids are so stupid that
educators, having forgotten the Japa-
nese, now compare American youth
with domestic reptiles.

According to these professional
educators, many of whom are them-
selves reptiles, Johnny, who is the
average American 10-year-old, doesn’t
know what state he lives in or the
difference between water and dirt or
that his name is Johnny. In compari-
son, Guadalupe, who is the average
10-year-old Iguana house pet, knows
his name well enough to come when
you call him in from the backyard
for his piano lessons.

The mentioning of Guadalupe’s
piano lessons has presented a perfect
transition to our next big subject:
music. Ten to 15 years ago, disco
music was the big craze and everyone
who was even remotely cool owned
a strobe light and a collection of
disco singles. This is a pretty embar-
rassing fact but at least everyone got
over it. But kids these days are get-

ting into something that they’ll proba-
bly never get over: New Kids On The
Block, which is a group of pre-pubes-
cent males who dance like John
Travolta on speed and dress like
transvestites.

The ideal evening for the typical
12-year-old girl is to go to a New
Kids concert, scream at the top of her
lungs, and rip off her clothing. Sure,
women did the same thing for Elvis,
but that was different because Elvis
was cool. At least he was full grown.
The New Kids have at least five years
before they even have to shave. Our
only hope is that they lose their
popularity when their voices change
during puberty or that they get heavi-
ly into drugs during high school and
quit singing.

Perhaps the worst problem with
the youth of today concerns the tele-
vision. When I was younger and
spending the majority of the day rot-
ting my brain with television, at least
I watched good programs. With clas-
sic heroes like Woody Woodpecker,
the Three Stooges and Tarzan, I was
inculcated with the positive values of

throwing food, drinking beer anti”. 0

having a good time with scantily clad
women like Jane.

Kids today have television heroes
like the Smurfs and Pee Wee Her-
man, whose sexual orientation is
questionable. While the Smurfs seem
heterosexual (though its debatable
because there’s only one female
member in the group) they live in an
unrealistic egalitarian communal com-
munity. If Woodie the Woodpecker
spent a day with the Smurfs, he’d
probably steal everything, have his
way with Smurfette and drive the
other smurfs, even Happy Smurf, to
suicide.

Because of the fact that my pet
iguana, Guadalupe, has just reminded
me that Woody the Woodpecker is
now on television, I am compelled to
end this article immediately. If any
readers have young siblings, I suggest
that they lock them up in a room
with Cheerios, Led Zeppelin albums
and Three Stooges videotapes and
leave them there until they grow up.
Or, if you have time, take them on a
little trip to the Grand Canyon.

Ortega is still better than Samoza

MY VIEW
By Alan Heinrich

In her “My View” last week, Ms. Spreng was
certainly correct to point out that moral outrage
sometimes blurs one’s reason. However, a greater
threat to one’s rational judgement is the eagerness
to interpret important events based on ideological
agendas — agendas developed not for the purpose
of understanding the truth, but for perpetuating
fundamentally unjust and undemocratic power
structures. Both she and Mr. Brubaker demonstrate
this unseemly eagerness in their columns.

Both Ms. Spreng and Mr. Brubaker seem to
have misplaced over 100 years of history by
suggesting that Nicaraguan poverty was a Sandi-
nista invention. Though enjoying low inﬂation,
high agricultural rates and a healthy trade surplus,
in the twilight of Somoza’s Nicaragua there_ were
over 200,000 landless peasants throughout the
country. The fact that the Somoza family owned
15 percent of all the land in Nicaragua gives
poignant insight into the realities of the time,
illustrating the ephemerality of so many economic
indicators when the distribution of resources is as
askew as it is in Central America. Although Ms.
Spreng agrees with me that “there has been much
to indict" in U.S. relations with Nicaragua, she
fails to see two very important facts: 1. Relations
with Sorrioza were not an isolated and unfortunate
incident — rather, they were part of a systematic
policy of interventionism, militarism and dependen-
cy; and 2. There has not been official recognition
of — much less, repentance for - this policy; in
fact, it continues to this day. Therefore, there is
ample reason to harbor deep suspicions regarding
this latest chapter in the United States’ affront to
Nicaraguan sovereignty. Let's take a closer look at
the history of this system.

Since the 19th century, Latin America has
figured in the North American scheme of things
in one simple way: as the cheapest possible suppli-
er of natural resources. The latter part of that
century saw the United States and Britain hood-
wink Central Americans with various railroad
swindles, culminating in the staggering accumula-
tion of property by Minor Keith’s infamous United
Fruit Company. Ever since those times, the United
States has viewed Central America with that
peculiar possessiveness the only word for which is

imperialism.

Let me illustrate this. In March of 1950,
George Kennan —- a high-level State Department
official, formulator of “containment theory,” which
provided the major theoretical justification for Viet-
nam, yet was a theory which he first developed
under the name of “Mr. X” (presumably ashamed
to sign his name to it) — had a meeting with U.S.
Latin American ambassadors in Rio de Janeiro.
During this meeting, Kennan outlined U.S. policy
objectives in Latin America. The first of such
objectives was “the protection of our raw materi-
als." I needn't comment on the force of the pos-
sessive adjective here. Kennan concluded, “The
final answer might be an unpleasant one, but... we
should not hesitate before police repression by the
local government... It is better to have a strong
regime in power than a liberal government if it is
indulgent and relaxed and penetrated by the Com-
munists.”

The Latin American people
themselves could have dem-
ocracy only if they chose
their leaders from within the
pool of candidates accept-
able to the United States.

The force of Kennan’s statement, of course, is
that the parameters of the Latin American political
spectrum are to be set by the United States. The
Latin American people themselves could have
democracy only insofar as they chose their leaders
from within the pool of candidates acceptable to
the United States. That is, Latin American sover-
eignty was to be undermined as a matter of policy.

In fact, the United States has not strayed from
the course that Kennan outlined. In 1954, the
Eisenhower Administration planned and funded the
overthrow of the Arbenz government of Guatemala
— which came to power through one of the fairest
and most open and democratic elections in that
nation’s history. Thanks to the agrarian reform
legislation of Arbenz — which was to redistribute
only the unused portions of the United Fruit
Company’s ill-gotten land holdings, for which they
were to be compensated by the government —
Washington began to cry in unison: “Communist!"
The incoherence of this reasoning can be seen

in the remark which John Peurifoy, the U.S.
ambassador to the country, made to a Guatemalan
official shortly before the invasion: “Agrarian
reform had been instituted in China... China is
today a Communist country.” Since then, Guate-
mala has witnessed a bloodbath. Less dramatically,
the United States has had El Salvador militarized
to the point where there is no possibility of an
Arbenz ever coming to power: as the October
bombing of the headquarters of the labor union
FENESTRAS demonstrates, political opposition is
swiftly eradicated by the army — the same army
that has received over $4 billion of U.S. aid over
the past 10 years.

For Ms. Spreng, Carter apparently represented
a change in such policy. Rebutting my assertion
that Carter actually continued the great U.S. tradi-
tion of “philotyranticism” with regard to Somoza,
Ms. Spreng responds, “Even Henry Kissinger
stated that ‘the Jimmy Carter Administration active-
ly participated in the overthrow of the Somoza
government.’ ” (Even Henry Kissinger?? What
does that mean? Ms. Spreng is well aware that
Kissinger is a Republican crony). However, when
Kissinger accused Carter of helping to topple
Somoza, what he really meant was that Carter did
not embrace the murderer with the same enthusi-
asm as did past presidents. It is true that Cages‘
temporarily cut Somoza off from U.S. economic
aid after the most horrifying human rights abuses
were reported. But it was soon restored. Just two
months before Somoza was driven from Nicaragua
forever, Carter helped Somoza receive a $66
million loan from the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Spreng must think that Carter intended to
drive Somoza out of Managua by beating him with
dollar bills. Thus, Carter no less than other presi-
dents bears responsibility in the $1.5 billion debt
Somoza left behind: a figure that dwarfs Carter’s
aid packages to the Sandinistas.

None of this is to suggest that Ortega is a great
guy. But it is doublethirik at its worst to equate
him with Somoza: Ortega may be a bully, but
Somoza was a murderer. More importantly, Mr.
Ortega’s actions are not done in my name. Why
are Ms. Spreng and Mr. Brubaker so outraged by
the sorry state of things in Nicaragua, when our
government has been funding armies whose abuses
of human rights make Ortega and his men look
like Jeffersonians? This funding is conducted by
leaders who claim to be representing us: that
makes us all accomplices to murder.

Program aids term paper blues

By Jason Kelley
Staff Reporter

A Washington and Lee student
who ﬂunked Computer Science 111
twice, has created a program that will

vmake writing term papers much easier

for students all over the country.

Sophomore Mike Adams is in the
ﬁnal stages of completing a com-
puter program that creates bibliogra-
phies and outlines, writes in foreign
languages, unnoticeably lengthens
papers, scrambles confidential doc-
uments and allows the user to “talk”
to the computer in plain English. He
expects the program to be released
next month,

Adams has written his program,
called Thesys, to work in conjunc-
tion with the WordPerfect word pro-
cessing program. He said he plans to
begin selling the program in about
three weeks here on the W&L cam-
pus and across the nation.

Adams, who is currently on leave
from the university to complete the
project, said that Thesys will sell for
$50 retail, but W&L students will
probably be getting a discount.

“Advance sales from other uni-
versities and businesses will already
allow me to return to W&L without
parental ﬁnancial support,” he said.

The program can create bibliogra-

phies in any of the four recognized
standard forms. It takes entries from
different types of sources and orders,
punctuates, spaces and alphabetizes
them in a few seconds.

In a demonstration, the program
ordered and alphabetized a bibliogra-
phy with 171 entries in just three
seconds.

Thesys also creates outlines by
setting up the format and automati-
cally placing entries.

For students, though, the most
exciting feature is that Thesys will
almost unnoticeably expand the size
of a paper by up to 25 percent. By
altering the spacing between certain
letters and characters within words (a
process called keming) the program
can make a 10 page paper fill 12
pages without any noticeable sign of
alteration.

In some applications of the pro-
gram, the user is able to “command”
the computer without using the tech-
nical prograrnrning language. The
user could type in “Please set the
right margyn [yes, misspelled] to
about three inches,” and the comput-
er would be able to understand and
execute the request.

Adams said, “This feature makes
it a convenient program for the non-
technical user. It’s pretty much idiot
proof.”

Adams said he has spent approxi-

mately 2,500-3,000 hours writing the
program.

His parents provided the more
than $11,000 it has cost to get in-
struction manuals, a cover design, and
the computer diskettes printed, he
said.

Adams decided to develop and
market his program idea on his own.
The president of WordPerfect corpo-
ration encouraged him to do so even
though WordPerfect does not itself
develop programs from sources other
than their own research and develop-
ment department.

Adams said he has representatives
at W&L who are helping him sell the
program, and he hopes to get one
student from each state to help him
sell Thesys to universities all over the
country.

The program still has some bugs
and is being proofread by W&L
German Professor Robert Young-
blood, who is an expert on biblio-
graphical resources and who has been
a major contributor to well known
bibliography style manuals.

Adams hopes to have the copy-
righted program ready for release
within three weeks, but he said he
would rather make sure that all the
problems are ironed out and release it
late rather than have users encounter
problems.-

Thesys also allows the user to

type with characters from four differ-
ent foreign languages and to use
scientiﬁc symbols not present on the
regular WordPerfect keyboard.

Adams said he discovered using
WordPerfect macros (groups of com-
mands defined by the user in the
program) to create his own programs
last summer while working as a
programmer at the Army Institute of
Chemical Defense.

Even though he failed Computer
Science 111, he says the approachto
programming logic and management
that he learned in Computer Science
110 was an invaluable tool in allow-
ing him to create Thesys.

Adams has plans for follow-up
programs. but does not want the
nature of these disclosed because he
fears that competitors, especially large
software companies, will be able do
develop these ideas faster than he
can.
Adams said he lost his enitire
program in mid-January because his
diskette went bad. Because he did not
have a back-up disk, he said he had
to reprint the whole program from his
memory and the minimal notes he
had been keeping.

Adams said his real interest is not
programming, but foreign language
literature. He said he would like to
get a doctorate in one of the romance
languages and be a college professor.

MSA to hold weekend conference

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Staff Reporter

Minority students, prospective
students and alurrmi will gather this
weekend for Washington and Lee's
second Minority Student/Alumni
Co erence.

vxccording to James Rambeau,

Association, the purpose of the con-
ference is to bring the alumni closer
to current students and the campus in
general.

“In the past several years we've
found that minority alumni have not
returned to campus or have been less
active than other alunmi. A confer-
ence of this sort is to bring the alum-
ni closer and to generate interest in
what’s going on,” Rambeau said.

In addition to current students and
alumni, 22 prospective minority stu-
dents have been invited to participate
in the weekend activities, according
to Rambeau.

The prospective students arrived
today and attended a reception this

afternoon where they had the oppor-
tunity to meet current W&L students,
especially members of the Student
Recruitment Committee, Rambeau
said. Tomorrow the students will
attend classes and have interviews
with the Admissions Office and pro-
fessors who teach subjects in which
they are interested.

Two panel discussions are sched-
uled for tomorrow afternoon after the
12-18 expected alumni arrive.

“The alumni will participate in a
panel discussion on the significance
of a Washington and Lee education
and what it can do for the students.
They can give their perspective on
student life during their own time,”
Rambeau said. '

The deans of students will con-
duct a second discussion on campus
life in general, and a reception for
alumni and students is planned for
that evening.

While the prospectives are being
interviewed Saturday morning, Anece
McCloud, Associate Dean of Students
for Minority and International Affairs,
will chair a discussion with current

demically qualified students.”
However a majority of both stu-
dents and alumni responding to that
poll felt that W&L should not be-
come coeducational, citing costs and
a loss of distinctiveness as the two

major disadvantages of admitting
women to the school.
According to Tumer’s report,

some of the faculty responding to the
VMI poll who opposed coeducation
were openly hostile to those who
supported it. One professor suggested
that any faculty member who did not
agree with VMl’s admissions policy
should leave the college; another
stated that simply taking the poll on
the issue was a disservice to VMI.
Other respondents believed “the

constitutional issued were clear, that
women had to be allowed admission
to the state school,” according to
Turner.

Many faculty members commented
that admitting women would mitigate
some of what the respondents per-
ceived as abusive practices in the
barracks.

A spokesman for VMI said the
school probably would have no offi-
cial comment on the poll, and Tur-
ner’s statement said the AAUP is not
a part of the school administration.

“Its actions and opinions can not
be interpreted as constituting any part
of VMI’s official position,’ ’ according
to the release.

 
     

students and alumni on recent campus
events. That night the MSA is spon-
soring a dinner-dance and band in the
General Headquarters for the minority
students and alumni.

The weekend activities will end
Sunday morning with an informal
brunch in the University Center be-

fore the prospective students leave
campus.

While prospective minority stu-
dents will continue to visit the cam-
pus annually, Rambeau said after this
year, the Minority Students/Alumni
Conference will be held only every
four years.

EC

from page 1

The deadline, originally set at
March 12, was last week extended to
March 19, because the EC had re-
ceived only 12 applications including
only two from the undergraduate
campus.

First-year law Rep. Julie Alagna
said that not enough notices were
posted at the Law School, and some
law students did not know that the
applications were due.

EC Vice President Jonathan
Sheinberg feared that extending the
application process further might not
give the committee time to accom-
plish something this year. He also
noted that most of the applications
received were from law students.

Applicants must sign up for an
interview outside University Center
Coordinator Carol Calkins’ office.

Cold Check Committee Chairman
James Rambeau presented a budget
report to the EC.

The Cold Check Committee cur-
rently stands in deﬁcit by $349.82,
according to the report, but expects to
recover $668.99 from liabilities,
yielding a positive net balance of
$319.17.

Rambeau reported that $73.50 of
$113.50 in fines has been collected,
with one fine outstanding.

The Cold Check Committee was
unable to cover some checks written
by an international student from Ke-
nya who has withdrawn from school,
according to Rambeau. Assistant
Dean of Students Kenneth Ruscio

plans to contact the former student’s
family with a list of debts.

Sophomore EC Rep. Caroline
Wight reminded Rambeau that the EC
voted that the Cold Check Committee
levy no fine less than $5 so that
students would take ﬁnes more seri-
ously. Fines as low as_$2 were previ-
ously levied.

Rambeau added that he would
soon resign from his post as chair-
man so that he may participate in the
Washington Term Program. He rec-
ommended that the EC consider Cold

Check Committee Secretary Robert-

Shelton to fill the chairman post.

The Fancy Dress Committee post-
poned their budget hearing until next
Monday. Sheinberg said the FD Com-
mittee’s financial totals will be more
definite by then.

Liberty Hall Volunteers did not
appear for their budget hearing. The
EC unanimously voted to freeze their
account.

The Minority Student Association
and the Volleyball Club will present
budget reports to the EC next Mon-
day.

Dumas extended congratulations to
Women’s Field Hockey and Rugby
for their successful weekends.

“I'd definitely like to congratu-
late the Fiji Love Natives,” added
Dumas, regarding Fiji’s win at the
MTV Lip Synch on Sunday. “I'm
eagerly waiting to hear from Mr.
Hartog to see what ...[Fiji’s appear-
ance] will do for admissions.”

Austria and Frankfurt University
and has directed N.E.H. Summer
Seminars and Institutes at the Uni-
versity of California at Berkelely
and Santa Cruz.

The author of three books and
numerous articles, Dreyfus has
been frequently interviewed by
print media and radio and tele-
vision stations around the world on
programs such as NOVA, CBS
EVening News with Dan Rather,
and the British Broadcasting Cor-
poration, among others.

heim Fellowship, and, most recent-
ly, an NEH Basic Research Grant.
During his visit to W&L, Drey-
fus will also meet with undergrad-
uate students in the cognitive
science and philosophy classes.

“Mystical Experience Among
Contemporary Egyptian Sufis”
will be the topic of a lecture at
W&L tonight at 8 p.m. in Room
221 of the Commerce School.
The lecture will be given by Val-
erie Hoffman-Ladd of the Uni-
versity of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign.

Hoffman-Ladd has recently
returned from a two-year research
leave spent in Egypt, where she
lived among Muslim mystics
(“Sufis”) and their living saints.
She has studied at the American
University in Cairo and at L’Uni-
versite de Tunis. SHe received
her doctorate in 1986 from the
University of Chicago in Arabic
and Islamic Studies.

With her dissertation, “The

Religious Life of Muslim Women
in Contemporary Egypt,” to soon
be published, Hoffman-Ladd is at
work on another book, Mystics and
Saints in Modern Egypt.

Delta Gamma’s PHC rep-

resentative, freshman Kimberly Mar-
cott told the PHC that DG is already
planning another Open House for
unaffiliated women. Aside from the 16
members of the interest group, there
will also be initiated members of Delta
Gamma present from other uni-
versities such as James Madison Uni-
versity.

According to the agreement be-
tween DG and the PHC, Delta Gamma
will have the opportunity to begin co-
lonization as early as next fall. This
colonization is plarmed to be as close
as possible to the men's fall rush
dates. Following colonization, DG
will also have the option to “contin-
uous open bid,” accepting pledges at
any time following the formal coloni-
zation period through Dec. 5, 1990.
Mitchell said DG will then participate
in Formal Winter Rush with the three
established sororities.

know our school was out there.”

According to Mitchell, by enabling
DG to colonize in the fall and rush in
the winter, the PHC is giving DG the
opportunity to establish themselves on
the campus of Washington and Lee
before having them compete with the
three sororities in formal rush activi-
ties.

Quota, the number of bids each
group are each able to give out during
the formal rush period, will be split
four ways, Mitchell said. Delta Ga-
mma will not be required to include
the girls who are interested in coloniz-
ing before winter rush in its quota, al-
lowing DG to give out the same num-
bcr of bids as the other three sororities
during formal rush.

PHC also agreed that following
Winter Rush, only Delta Gamma
should have the opportunity to “con-
tinuous open bid.” Each of the three
sororities willingly consented to this
limitation since all three chapters were
well over “total,” Mitchell said.

Lee men’s track team gained two
‘victories but had their winning streak
.end at 38 straight meets while the
women’s team won three times before
‘being edged by John Carroll Univer-
_,sity.
' The Generals ﬁnished second to
g1Old Dominion Athletic Conference
rival Bridgewater College, perhaps
‘their toughest opponent this year. The
men were able to outpoint other
ODAC foes Eastern Mennonite and
4Roanoke College. The ﬁnal tally for
the men on the day was BC 80,
rW&L 50, EMC 33, RC 6.

There were a number of first
’place ﬁnishers for head coach Norris
,Aldridge. Senior tri-captain Wes Boyd

was a double winner, ﬁnishing ﬁrst
4 in both the 100 meter and 200 meter
rdashes. Senior Scott Williams won
the 400 meter run, junior tri-captain
lDavid Martin won the 1500 meter
\ run, and sophomore Charles Edwards
"ﬁnished ahead of the pack in the
t 5000 meter run. The lone field event
winner was senior tri-captain Phillip
Sampson in the pole vault.

competes in six events. Said A]-
dridge, “Carl’s absence hurt us be-
cause he gets a lot of points for the
team.” The extent of Gilbert’s injury
is not yet certain, and Aldridge is
taking no chances. Gilbert will not
run this weekend at the Liberty Invi-
tational.

The women had a very impressive
day as well losing by only eleven
points to John Carroll University, but
handily defeated Easterh Mennonite,
Bridgewater, and Roanoke. The
women’s ﬁnal results were JCU 87,
W&L 76, EMC 34, BC 6, RC 0.

Senior co-captain Beth Stutzmann
won four individual events to lead the
Generals, including helping the 4x100
relay team break a school record.

Juniors Sandi Dudley and Lisa Jay
also contributed to the strong team
performance. Dudley won the javelin
and Jay was the discus throw winner.

Head coach John Tucker noted
junior co-captain Sarah Bolte’s ﬁne
performance in her 400 meter school
record breaking performance and her
leg in the 4x100 meter relay.

This weekend the men travel to
the Liberty Invitational facing mostly
Division II and low Division I
schools. The women will travel to
Davidson for the Davidson Invitation-

With the scored tied at 0-0 in the
ﬁfth inning of yesterday's baseball
game against Hampden-Sydney, soph-
omore ﬁrst baseman T.J. Daly had
some advice for his Washington and
Lee teammates.

“You play to win, you don’t play
to play,” he said, his voice loud
enough for all at Smith Field to hear.

Thus inspired, the Generals moun-
ted two offensive threats in the sixth
and seventh innings after their de-
fense came up with three quick outs
to halt a bases-loaded threat by the
Tigers in the top of the sixth inning.

Yet, W&L did not win on this
day, the first full day of spring, as
Hampden-Sydney (5-5) picked up
runs in the seventh and eighth in-
nings to escape with a 2-0 victory
despite another ﬁne pitching per-
formance by sophomore Steve Momo-
rella. It was W&L’s fourth loss by
two runs or less this season.

The loss dropped the Generals’
record to 2-5, 0-3 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference. In a week’s
schedule shortened by poor weather,

. W&L’s only other game was a 7-5

defeat against Eastern Mennonite this
past Thursday. Saturday's double-
header against Randolph-Macon was
rained out.

Yesterday, Harnpden—Sydney, the
defending ODAC champions, loaded
the bases in the sixth on a hit bats-
man and two singles. H-SC then tried
a suicide squeeze, but Momorella
threw the lead runner out at the plate.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

From Staff Reports

For the second year in a row,
the entire Washington and Lee
swimming contingent returned to
Lexington with Division III All-
America honors.

Sophomore. Jay Smith could
not continue his unbeaten string,
but he could continue his string
of All-America years. Smith ﬁn-
ished seventh in the nation in the
100-yard backstroke at nationals.
Smith earned All-America honors
for his top-eight ﬁnish, but he
was not alone.

Joining Smith was sophomore
Chip Nordhoff, who earned Hon-
orable Mention All-America hon-
ors in both the 200 freestyle and
the 200 backstroke, and the W&L
freestyle relay team of Smith,
Nordhoff, junior Jim Dunlevy and
sophomore Doug Brown, which
earned Honorable Mention All-
America honors in the 200, 400
and 800 freestyle relays.

The Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team saw their
three-garne winning streak snap-
ped with a loss at Roanoke on
Saturday and then stubbed their
toes Wednesday against Lynch-
burg.

After falling behind 8-0 to
Roanoke in the first half, the
Generals could not come all the
way back for the win. A second

half rally fell short. The Generals
had closed to 9-6 on a goal by
senior Chris Mastrogiovanni, but
could get no closer as the Gener-
als fell ll-7. Sophomore Wiemi
Douoguih led W&L with three
goals and junior goalie Tom Cos-
tello made 14 saves.

On Wednesday, the Generals
again fell behind late at Lynch-
burg and had to make a come-
back. Trailing 6-4 with two min-
utcs left, the Generals rallied to
tie the game at 6-6 and force a
sudden death overtime, but Bill
Becker scored with 1:32 to play
-irr-_the~—eit4sa~wpei=ie_d-.=,-to--=ha:ad-v~the~ 4

The Washington and Lee
women's lacrosse team salvaged a
tough week with a win Wednes-
day against Longwood College,
their ﬁrst win of the season.

W&L dropped two games by
three goals against Bridgewater
and Guilford and fell to national
power Western Maryland 7-2. On
Wednesday the Generals dropped
Longwood 8-7 to improve their
record to 1-4, 0-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The Washington and Lee golf
team ran its record to 10-1 last
week.

then flied out to rightﬁelder John
Durant. After receiving the relay
throw from Durant, Daly made a
perfect throw to catcher Chris
Kavanagh to nail the runner at the
plate for the double play.

As the Generals returned to their
dugout, head coach Jeff Stickley
repeated I‘ tly’s words, “Play to win,
don’t play 9 play.”

W&L 1 an proceeded to get two
of its four ‘ts when Durant lined a
single to le‘ ﬁeld and sophomore

' Brain Harper xlooped a single to left.

They were b(; *1 stranded on base.

The Genera s other scoring chance
came in the SC, /enth after Kavanagh
started the inning with a ground
single to left field. Sophomore Pete
Castiglione, running for Kavanagh,
reached second on a failed pick-off
attempt, but the inning ended when
he was tagged out in a rundown after ,
rounding third base too far on senior
Kirk Thompson’s single.

The Tigers scored in their half of
the seventh on a‘single, a stolen base
coupled with a throwing error and
another single.

The lead increased to 2-0 in the
next inning by way of an unearned
run.

With the loss, Momorella’s record
fell to 0-3, although he now has 15
strikeouts in three complete games.
Momorella was 6-0 last season.

This past Thursday, W&L held a
3-2 lead over after three innings, but
ended up losing 7-5.

“I thought we played fairly well,”
Stickley said. “But we couldn’t hold
the lead and then we couldn’t score
at the end. We’re getting people on
base, but we‘re just not scoring

effort falls short again, 2-0

them.”

Eastem Mennonite scored two
rtms in the ﬁfth inning and three runs
in the sixth on three doubles.

W&L countered with two runs in
their sixth inning and started a come-
back in the eighth with the score 7-
5, but an interference call on junior
Tim Wheeler, who was hit with a
thrown ball while coming into second
base, produced two outs.

The Generals then loaded the
bases when junior J.T. Swartz and
Thompson got singles and senior
Bobby Rimmer reached ﬁrst on a
throwing error. But that was as far
as the threat would go and the game '
called after eight innings because of
inadequate light.

“I didn't think it was a very good
call,” Stickley said, referring to the
interference ruling. “But that's the
way it goes. It didn't lose the game
for us, we should have been ahead at
that time.”

Sophomore Pete Klingelhoffer
went 2-for-4 and Kavanagh was 1-
for-3 with a triple and two runs
scored.

“We just need to score runs when
the opportunity arise and play better
defensively, but that will come with
playing,” Stickley said.

“The next couple of weeks will
tell a lot. We’re excited about play-
ing,” he added.

In the next couple of weeks the
Generals will play a lot as yester-
day's game kicked off a series of
nine games in 11 days. W&L played '
at Lynchburg today and will host
doubleheaders against Emory and ,
Henry on Saturday and Randolph- ‘
Macon on Monday.

Women start season with _
six consecutive ODAC wins;

By Matt Jennings
Staff Reporter

If the ﬁrst few matches of the
spring season are a gauge for how
successful the Washington and Lee
women’s tennis team will be this
year, then the remaining Division III
teams should look out.

Coming off a 9-1 fall record, the
Generals opened the week by soundly
defeating Old Dominion Athletic
Conference foes Hollins 9-0 and

On Friday, the Generals faced
Randolph-Macon in Ashland. The top
six, consisting of junior Kelly Mar-
tone, senior Teresa Southard, junior
Kathy Leake, freshman Mason Smith,
sophomore Brannon Aden and fresh-
man Elizabeth Hancock all won,
clinching the match. The doubles
were cancelled due to darkness, giv-
ing the Generals a 6-0 win.

The Generals continued
eastward trek on Saturday with a stop
at Virginia Wesleyan, with the results
much the same as in Ashland. W&L
tumed back VWC 6-3, sparked by a
three set win by Martone at No. 1.
Martone pulled out the win in a tie
breaker, 6-2, 3-6 7-6 (7-5).

Southard, Leake and sophomore
Muriel Foster, recovering from ill-
ness, all followed with straight set
wins, and after Smith lost a tough
three set decision, Aden clinched the
win with a convincing 6-0, 6-1 win.

Smith and Foster got the lone
doubles win for the Generals at No.
2 with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) win.

On Tuesday the women returned
home and stayed in town long
enough to defeat Lynchburg 7-2,
winning ﬁve out of six singles to
clinch the win. Yesterday, the Gener-
als ran their record to 6-0 with a 5-
3 win over Roanoke, getting the
deciding win from the No. 3 doubles
team of Southard and Hancock.

The Generals are playing without

 .juni.or—..Jea.n.— Stromari, -the two-time~

ODAC player of the year, in confer-
ence matches. Since Stroman will be
away in the spring and will not be
able to compete at the ODAC cham-
pionships, Martone is playing No. 1
in ODAC play.

The men's tennis team started
slow, but rebounded with wins over
Wheaton and ODAC rival Lynchburg.

The Generals kept their Division
III record unblemished with a 6-3
win over Wheaton and a 7-2 win
over Lynchburg. The lone loss was to
Division I William and Mary 7-2.
The men’s record stands at 3-2, 2-0
in the conference.

The men entertain four tough
opponents next week, with all the
matches being at home. The women
continue to travel, having only three
home matches this year, and will take
on Catholic, George Mason and Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman's College.

Entertainment Columnist

Twenty-ﬁve confirmed dead. A
ninety—f1ve minute movie. It works
out to a killing every 3.8 minutes.
But the twenty-ﬁve dead doesn’t
include the twenty-odd attacks, runn-
ing the spectrum from broken bones
to fractured skulls. Factor in all acts
of violence, and our ﬁgures rise to a
violent act every 2.1 minutes. Talk
about redeﬁning ‘ ‘action-packed. ’ ’

I want to thank two people who
played a role in gathering these stat-
istics: (1) Jon Sheinberg, who saw
the film earlier in the week and sug-
gested I keep a body count; (2) Julie
Salerno, who bravely stayed in her
theater seat and kept a running count
as I furiously wrote my notes. We
ain’t talking a Walt Disney produc-
tion here folks, but rather the new
thriller Hard to Kill.

The only kind remark I can make
is that the movie is a cliche-ridden
orgy to violence. Steven Seagal plays
veteran cop Mason Storm. When the
movie starts we find super-cop Storm
on a lone stakeout. Our intrepid hero
discovers that the mob wants to blow
up a Senator’s plane and then put

Southern

E

their own man — Vernon Trent —
into power. Yikesll Storm is acciden-
tally discovered. He swiftly escapes,
breaks up a liquor store robbery, and
then saunters home. Ooops!!I The
bad men discover that Storm was
spying on them and decide to snuff
him out.

Fortunately, the villains don't
move in on the Storm residence until
we meet Storrn’s cuddly son. And his
loving wife. And his beautifully-
decorated home. ,

After we have our heartstrings
tugged, the bad guys wreck the
house, murder Storrn’s wife, shoot
Storm’s sweet little kid, and blow
away Storm. Switch to hospital emer-
gency room where his teary-eyed
police commander informs the underl-
ings that Storm “had more honor and
guts than the entire department put
together.” I was reaching for my
milk-duds, not my hankie, at this
point.

But holy heroics, Batman — Storm
isn't dead!!! He is merely in a seven-
year coma and in the capable hands
of nurse Andy Stewart (Kelli Le
Brock). Stewart is a beautiful young
women who upholds the dignity of
the medical profession. For example:

Comfort

The second armual “Southem Comfort Invitational” will take place on

Wednesday, March 28th, at 8:00 p.m. in General Headquarters.

The

Invitational, which is hosted by the Washington and Lee musical group
Southern Comfort, will feature the V.M.I. Sentinels from Virginia Military
Institute, Baldwin Charm from Mary Baldwin Women’s College, Virginia
Belles from the University of Virginia, and Washington and Lee’s own Jubi-

Lee.

Publicist and Southern Comfort member Franklin Daniels said that

“Southem Comfort wants to showcase

the fact that there are a lot a good,

small, musical groups around. It was a big hit last year, and this year we are

hoping it will be more popular.”

Each group will have around twenty-five minutes to perform, with
Southern Comfort opening and closing the Invitational. There is no charge

for admission.

The Ring-tum Phl, March 22, 1990

Hard to Kill deserves an early death

while removing the comatose Storrn’s
sheets, Stewart stares at his crotch
and tells him to wake up “because
you have soooo much to live for.”
What poignant words! What a haunt-
ing script! The twenty thousand dollar
question — can you predict what
transpires next?

If you guessed that Storm remains
a vegetable, then you deserve sitting
through this movie. Of course Storm
instantly wakes up. The rest is as
believable as my Grandfather's golf-
ing stories: Storm makes a speedy
recovery from seven years of sleep-
ing. How, you ask? The answer is
simple! Storrn’s former Chinese in-
structor taught him in the ways of
healing herbs and soothing acupunc-
ture (I guess his old master didn't
have time to enlighten him in the
ways of “The Force").

But all work and no play makes
for a boring movie, so Storm allows
time in his hectic training schedule to
bed the hot-blooded Nurse Stewart.
Then back to his herbs. Finally, after
burning tons of incense and jogging
up mountain peaks, Storm decides to
go after the bad guys. Let's give the
man a hand.

The rest of the film is too painful
for me to completely recall. However

I do remember one bit of splendid
dialogue that changed my life for-
ever — when Storm tells the
gangsters that the “anticipation of
death is worse than death itse .”
Utter dismay overcame me.

There are three points I want to
make concerning this philosophical
gem: (1) Storm plagiarized this pas-
sage from Aristotle; (2) Mason Storm
has been reincarnated and knows
what it is like to die; (3) the sentence
should be changed to “the only thing
worse that the anticipation of death is
watching this film." :

Even for the genre of “the shoot-
them-up cop thriller,” this film is an
utter embarrassment. Steven Seagal is
the product of the Clint Eastwood
school of acting. This is not to be
taken as an anti-Eastwood remark,
but there is only ONE master of the
stoic one-liner. Real—life wife Le
Brock should stick with making
shampoo commercials.

Peppers will grade this atrocity a
“D-” and recommend that the film
be sentenced to an early box office
death. I am filled with shame to have
seen this movie, and I can only count
the days until The Hunt for Red Oc-
tober arrives in Lexington.
