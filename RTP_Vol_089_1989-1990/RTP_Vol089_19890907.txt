Washington and Lee's chapter of
Phi Delta Theta has hired a house
mother and has been put on
probation after the chapter's house
was left “just generally trashed" at
the end of May, according to

- Associate Dean of Students Leroy

r

“Buddy” Atkins.

In an Aug. 22 letter to chapter
President Warren Holland, Atkins
said the probation, which will
continue at least until Jan. 29, 1990,
limits the number of Phi Delt pledges
to 15. The probation also bans week-

- night parties and limits the Phi Delts

to only four parties per month and
only two per month in the Phi Delt
house. 1
Also, the house grade—point
average must rise at least one place
per term in the rankings of
fraternities, and the chapter me.-‘t
' “develop -and implement an ongoing
service project to benefit the
community, the college or the Greek
system," Atkins wrote.

Finally, “the chapter must
improve its relationship and
cooperation with other Greek
organizations on campus and

substantially improve its reputation,”
the letter said.

In an interview Tuesday, Atkins
said the 1988-89 academic year was
«the second straight that ended with
Phi Delt house in
condition and in
.,\jolation of W&L's Standards for

Proctor Charles "Murph" Murray
said he entered the house on June 1
and discovered that nearly all the
windows on the second and third
floors had been broken.

‘exists in the house that this is the

U i In the letter to Holland. Atkins
said, “after viewing the condition in

' which the chapter house was left
following ﬁnal exams, there is no
question that a substantial number of
brothers lacks the minimal respect for
property and particularly for the
chapter house which is required by
the Standards."
‘ Atkins said the probation is
“intended to be a stern reminder" of
the importance of compliance with
the Standards and “to serve as a
guideline for the rapid solution of

chapter problems.” He said that, if
the conditions are not met, W&L
“will withdraw its recognition of the
chapter."

While Holland said he
understands Atkins’ position, he said
some aspects of the probation —
particularly the limit on the number
of pledges — were “a little unfair."
He said representatives of his
fraternity met with Atkins Wednesday
and asked him to rescind some
aspects of the probation, but he said
those appeals failed.

"A few bad people have done the
damage," Holland said. “I don't
think anybody in this house now had
anything to do with that.”

Holland said he thinks most of
the damage to the house was caused

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

Over the summer, several major

changes were made in the
Washington and Lee athletic
department. In unrelated moves,

athletic director William McHenry
resigned from his post and head
lacrosse coach Dennis Daly was
reassigned to a new position within
the department.

McHenry, who also serves as the
head of the physical education
department, held the position of
athletic director at W&L from 1971
to 1989. His resignation went into
effect on July 1 of this year.

Said W&L president John Wilson,
"Bill's wonderful, outgoing
personality and admirable values have
given great strength to the work of
our university. I am confident that
Bill's experience and character will
lead to a stronger department of
physical education and a revitalized
intramural program."

McHenry, a Swarthmore, Pa.
native, received his bachelor of
science degree from W&L in 1954

ware County, in downstate New York.

mental hospitals and was at one time diag-

At about 1:30, Eben appeared from

University of Pennsylvania in 1961.

McHenry started his coaching
career at Pennsylvania Military
College, where he coached football,
swimming and track and also served
as director of the intramural program.
In 1958, McHenry moved on to
Williams College, where he served as
lacrosse and football coach.

His next stop was in Lebanon
Valley, Pa., in 1961. He was named
director of athletics and chairman of
the department of physical education
at Lebanon Valley College. In 1971,
McHenry‘, came to Washington and
Lee, where he held the same jobs.

From 1973-77,- McHenry served
as, head football coach, during which
tiriie he guided the Generals to a 12-

resigned as football coach in order to
concentrate fully on his
administrative duties.

the affairs of the NCAA. He has
served on many NCAA committees,

William Grafton Young, an assis-
tant director of admissions and the
coordinator of minority recruitment at
W&L, resigned his position Wednes-
day to be an assistant basketball
coach at Eastern Tennessee State
University.

"I've grown very attached to
Washington and Lee since I came
here," said Young. “However, this is
a unique opportunity for me to get
back into coaching, and I'm anxious
to get started."

Associate Director of Admissions
Julia Kozak said,“We're obviously
very sorry to lose Grafton. He's done
an absolutely tremendous job for us
in the admissions office, and we'll
certainly miss him, no question
about that."

Young came to W&L in 1985 as
an assisstant to Generals Head Bas-
ketball Coach Verne Canfield, and
joined the admissions office two
years later.

Since Young was placed in
charge of’ minority recruitment in
1987, the number of applications
from minority students has risen
greatly, said-Kozak.

“This last year alone, there was a
23 percent increase in the number of
applications from minority students,"
Young said. “I think that indicates a
lot of the old attitudes about minority
students are slowly going away."

However, Young said, there is
still a lot of animosity toward minor-
ity students on campus.

"The fact is, when I'm talking
with a minority prospective student, I
have to be honest and tell him that
there are still some places where he
won't be accepted," said Young.
"Old habits die hard, but I think at-
titudes here will eventually change."
“When people see a black, or asian
face on campus, they automatically
think this kid must have gotten a
break (from the admissions office),
but our goal has never been to sacri-
fice the quality of the student body
just to have more minority represen-

Over the summer, McHemy asked
to take a leave of absence from the
university. The Board of Trustees
granted McHenry a one-year leave,
and he will return in the fall of 1990
to resume his duties as head of the
physical education department.

An eight-member committee of
university officials has been
appointed to name a replacement for
McHenry as athletic director. The
committee is headed by William
Watt, head of the chemistry
department. The other members are
Larry Boetsch, Associate Dean of the
College; Barry Machado, chairman of
the athletic committee; Cinda Rankin,
assistant athletic director; Gary
Fallon, head football coach; Tom
Jones, head athletic trainer; Richard
Miller, associate director of athletics
and physical education; and William
Hartog, director of admissions. Miller
and Hartog have input into the
interviews but do not vote on a
candidate. Miller will serve as
interim athletic director until a

replacement is named.

According to Kozak, the school
plans to hire an interim replacement
to serve out the rest of the year, and
then begin a "nationwide talent

The school has already offered
the interim job to an as yet unnamed
individual, said Kozak.

says an official police summary of Eben's
actions the day after the murders took place.

Then Eben fired a single shot in the
direction of an attending deputy. The shot
fell short, and police returned ﬁre.

Eben was hit by two bullets and “imme-

He was later pronounced dead on the scene.

Police believe Eben's final confrontation
with the police was probably a planned sui-
cide. Eben neither opened fire on the police

to take cover during the three hours of ne-
gotiations that followed.

The police’ killing of Eben was pro-

Lexington
to collect

student tax

Many may be able
to avoid paying

By Pat Lopes
Associate Editor

According to

This fall, the city of Lexington will, for the first
time, begin collecting personal property tax on cars
owned by Washington and Lee Virginia Military
students, but students whose cars are taxed elsewhere
may avoid the tax altogether.

Lexington Mayor H.E. “Buddy"

Derrick, the taxing of student cars is not the result of
any action by Lexington City Council. Instead, Baker
will be enforcing state tax laws.

"We're not out to say, ‘ah ha, we're out to jump on
these students and tax these students,"’ said Derrick.
“The law states that they should pay."

According to section 58.1 of the Virginia code, a
municipality can tax motor vehicles “normally garaged
or parked" within city limits.

However, the same statute also insures that car

owners cannot be taxed twice. The statute states that the

Said Miller, “We have started
interviewing prospective candidates,
and we expect that the interviews
will last into early October."

A replacement will be named as
soon as possible, added Miller.

On Aug. 30, the university
announced that Daly was being
reassigned.He had been the coach of
the Generals since 1984, when he
arrived from successful tenures at
Amherst and Middlebury. In his six
seasons with the Generals, Daly's
teams posted a record of 30-49. His
best season was in 1987, when the
Generals made it to the NCAA
Division III final four, posting an 11-
4 mark.

When asked about the
reassignment, Daly said,“l have no
comment at this time."

Daly will remain at W&L as an
assistant professor of physical
education and an assistant football
coach.

According to Miller, the fall
lacrosse season has been cancelled,
“because we don't want to waste
any of the practice days allowed by

gned

the NCAA. I feel that it would be a
waste of practices to go through the
fall with one coach and then have to
make the players adjust to a new
coach and new philosophies in the
spring."

To make up for not playing a fall
schedule, the starting date for spring
practice, which normally is February
1, will be moved up.

Until a new coach is named,
assistant coach Jim McKeon will
serve as interim head coach, handling
all of the lacrosse tearn’s off-season
business, including a meeting with all
returning and incoming lacrosse
players to explain the situation.

A new head coach will not be
named until after an athletic director
1S chosen.

Wilson firmly stated, however,
that, because the university currently
needs to ﬁll two positions in the
department, one person will not fill
both slots. The athletic director will
be named, and then he will go
through the process of naming a new
lacrosse coach, Wilson said.

Reward offered
by Scarboroughs

 

By Greg Euston
Editor

The parents of Mary Ashley Scar-
borough have offered a $5,000 re-
ward for any information leading to
the conviction of the driver responsi-
ble for the hit-and-rim accident that
left their daughter dead March 16.

Since the reward offer was made
public in late July, Lexington Police
have received about a dozen phone
calls, mostly from western Virginia,
but as far away as California. So far,
none of the leads have panned out,
Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
said Tuesday.

According to Beard, most callers
have seen cars that fit the general
description of the vehicle assumed to
be involved in the accident. Police
are looking for a 1987 metallic blue
Honda Accord, possibly with front-
end or windshield damage. The car is
also missing its horn cover — the
only piece of debris, aside from
ﬂecks of blue paint, found at the
scene.

Scarborough, then a W&L fresh-
man, was killed while walking along
East Washington Street, near the po-
lice station. She was 19 years old.

After the accident, Lexington Po-
lice began looking for the blue Hon-
da. Beard said he notified Honda of-
ficials and asked that any part orders
for this area be flagged for further
investigation.

“The university is working close-
ly with the Lexington Police Depart-
ment. in this matter," said Brian
Snaw Director of University Com-
niunications. Reward posters are be-
ing distributed to newspapers and
colleges in western Virginia through
Shaw's office.

Copies of the reward poster were
sent to police chiefs throughout the
state, Shaw added.

Officials have asked that anyone
with information about Scarborough's
death contact Beard at the Lexington
Police Department, 300 East Wash-
ington Street, Lexington, Virginia,
24450.

“ has the most impact on the readers?”
reporting classes, death is always in the first paragraph

 

A story hits home

Death is certain. That fact most of us have accepted.
But deaths among college—age students are always a
little more unexpected and little more surprising. And
in a student population of 1,500, a death affects
everyone because our college atmosphere allows a
certain intimacy between students, even between
students who are not friends. After a few years here
most of the names and faces are familiar to everyone.

However, death is also news. Hard news. Cold
news. And death is big news. Especially in a student
body of 1,500.

I was shocked when I first heard of the death of Dan
McDowell, for Dan was more than a familiar face to
me. When I learned of the tragedy this summer, I did
not at first consider it a news item for THE RING-
TUM PHI. I think that I immediately closed over the
news and tried to absorb it.

I even asked the person who notified me about Dan’s
death not to tell me any of the details surrounding the
murders. My own way of dealing with death is to blot
out images, soften hard facts. I knew who, but I didn’t
care about with what, when, where or why.

It is with this attitude intact that a fellow Ring-tum
Phi staffer, in talking about our plans for the first issue
of the Phi, mentioned that, of course, the story about
Dan’s death would be the lead story on page one.

I recoiled. That had never occurred to me, for Dan’s

go on an inside news page, or maybe we could run it
“below the fold” on the front page, or maybe we
didn’t have to run it at all, since the murder had not
taken place when school was in session.

Of course, after thinking about it, I realized that
Dan’s and his farnily’s deaths are a big news event and

V they would have to run on the front page. Everyone is

talking about it.

In our journalism classes we learn to look at news by
asking, “What is the most important item? What has
the most impact on the readers?” In our simulated
reporting classes, death is always in the first paragraph
by asking, “What is the most important item? What
In our simulated

of the story if it is a part of the story...or you get an F
for bad news judgement.

But I didn’t learn in my journalism classes how to
successfully remove my emotion from the manner in
which I handle the news around me. I didn’t learn
where to run a story’ about the horrible event murder of
a friend. I didn’t learn how to report the facts without
feeling like I was sensationalizing the matter. I can
only hope that I have learned now, and that our
decision to run the story of Dan’s death on page one
will be accepted by his close friends.

I have been pulled from my shell and I have been
forced to stare all details of his murder in the face. I
have also seen the media handle this story in
excrucitaing detail, down to gruesome facts that left
searing images in my mind.

I searched for the middle ground, and hope that I
will be considered neither less of a journalist nor less
of a humanitarian for the way I chose to handle this
story. I knew the name behind the face. I knew the guy
who loved to ski and spoke French with a beautiful
accent. I wish’ only that the news could somehow
portray who he was, and not Dan only as the victim of

a horrible crime.

Honor and what

it means

 

MY VIEW
By Todd Peppers

I am now entering my fourth year
at Washington and Lee. During the
last thirty-six months I have grappled
with some troubling inconsistencies
in our Honor System. I want to start
by saying that the Honor System is
one of the unique aspects of our in-
stitution. When I tell campus visi-
tors about our community of trust,
they express amazement over unlock-
ed dorm rooms and unsupervised ex-
ams. The Honor System is one of
the things I cherish most about
iwashington and Lee. Yet paradoxi-
cally, it is also the one subject which
Icauses the most confusion and sad-
.ness for me.

I am not the only person at

Washington and Lee who has
watched fellow students be banned
, permanently for honor offenses. Al-
though saddened by the loss of ac-
quaintances and friends, I understand
their actions led to the painful out-
come. My confusion arises when
other students, whom I perceive as
committing greater acts of dishonor-
able behavior, are allowed to return
to Washington, and Lee to graduate.
I am not using the Honor System to
call their behavior dishonorable. It is
my own set of moral values that la-
bel their actions as dishonorable.
Allow me to expand my thoughts.

The “White Book," the “bible"
of the W&L Honor System, says
“the freedom given to students stems
from the understanding that persons
attending this university will act
honorably." Washington and Lee stu-
dents have defined honorable actions
as those that do not involve lying,
cheating or stealing. The White
Book adds “the Honor System is
based on the ftmdamental principle
that a spirit of trust pervades all as-
pects of student life." The two key
words are HONOR and TRUST. We
trust our fellow students in the sense
that they will not commit these three
acts. But are we defining “honor"
too tightly? It seems at Washington
and Lee we have become hypnotized
by the words “lie, cheat or steal."
We are blinded by the fact that hon-
or can stretch beyond these three
words. I propose that our narrow
definition of honor is critically weak-
ening the Honor System.

I accept the‘premise that lying,
cheating V and stealing; are dishonorable
acts and should be punished by per-
manent expulsion. However, we
need to go one step further. Let's
put aside the Honor System for one
moment and consider the following
question: Using your own set of
personal values, not what the Honor
System tells us, which would you

a candy bar from Kroger, or, 2) sell-
ing drugs in our community? Both
actions break existing laws. And the
two actions can lead to punishment.
My set of values indicates that sell-
ing drugs is a greater evil than steal-
ing candy. I also believe society
agrees with my viewpoint by assign-
ing drug dealers harsher penalties
than those assigned to shoplifters.
Do you agree?

Now we need to place the two
crimes within the parameters of our
Honor System. Cannot one make the
legitimate claim that the students of
Washington and Lee consider shop-
lifting a greater crime than dealing
drugs? If a Washington and Lee
student is found guilty in an Honor
Trial of stealing a candy bar, then
the only punishment is permanent
expulsion from the school-
Washington and Lee student is con-
victed in a court of selling drugs,
and serves the entire sentence, then
he or she can retum to our school.
Stop and ask yourself: do you
believe it is fair to expel the shoplift-
er and allow the drug dealer to
return?

If a

A dangerous and incorrect conclu-
sion can be made from my line of
reasoning. I am not trying to prove
that any actions which break laws of
the state are dishonorable. Speeding
tickets and jaywalking are not suffi-
cient reasons for removing a student
from school.

My conclusion is we have an
Honor System at Washington and
Lee that, as a piece of machinery,
functions quite well. Every student
is well versed on the procedures gov-
erning honor trials, the rights of the
accused and the punishment for the
guilty. Those are the cogs of our
mechanism. Yet, for the machinery
to work, a definition of honor must
be provided. The definition that the
student body is using— by focusing
on lying, cheating and stealing - has
critically weakened the Honor
System's original intentions.

Read the White Book carefully.
It states, “Although honorable con-
duct cannot be codified, lying, cheat-
ing and stealing are clear examples
of breaches of the Honor System.
The system applies to any conduct
considered dishonorable by the stu-

dent generation involved."

The key phrase is "ANY CON-

DUCT CONSIDERED DISHONOR-
ABLE BY THE STUDENT GENER-
ATION INVOLVED." [caps mine]
I used the selling of drugs for an
example of conduct we might label
as dishonorable. We shouldn't stop
there. I suggest our “student genera-
tion" start asking themselves some
key questions: is date rape a dishon-
orable act? Are deliberate actions
that cause bodily harm dishonorable?
And what of selling illegal sub-
stances? qr drunk driving that re-
sults in the death of another?

The goal of my paper is not to
whip the student body into a frenzy.
My point is not to suggest that un-
derage drinking is an honor offense -
— there are much greater issues to
consider. I call upon this "student
generation" to take a close look at
the deﬁnition of honor on our cam-
pus. Can we be proud of the evolu-
tion of the honorable “Washington
and Lee gentlemen?" We often
evoke the ghost of Robert E. Lee
when we speak of our school — is

Family travels

THE SBAR SIDE
By Jon Sbar

Back somewhere in history, after the earth was
formed from planetary jello-fragments and before
geologists began eating their laboratory samples
for lunch, a newspaper man named Frank devel-
oped the Golden Rule of Journalism: “If you
want to avoid getting poisoned or stabbed in your
sleep never write critical stories about your rela-
tives unless they're dead or too far away to harm
you physically.”

Since all of my relatives are currently in other
states and countries, I feel safe enough to begin
discussing a recent family trip to Africa. But be-
fore we get to Africa (literally,_ if you're having
hallucinations like mine) let me share some start-
ling family history. Descended from Jewish
Russians, I am the only son in a family of six; I
have three sisters - Tami, Karyn and Shannon.
Tami, the oldest one, is married to a Southern
Baptist from Florida. Karyn, the second oldest,
was married this past summer, to_ a moslem from
Morocco who has a French Catholic mother.
Shannon, my twin, is currently single although I
expect she will soon armounce her engagement to
a Native American Indian with Buddhist grandpar-
ents.

my strange family situation, I can get to my Afri-
can trip.

After surviving a grueling American wedding
in May, my family traveled to Morocco in North
Africa for a Moroccan ceremony in late July. My
brother-in-law, Kareem “Abdul—Jabaar” Tahiri is
from Casablanca, so naturally our Moroccan expe-
rience began there. Although the word “Casa-
blanca" tends to evoke romantic images involving
the horrnone-laden actor Humphrey Bogart, a
more accurate representation would involve me,
weak firm jet lag and chronic diarrhea, sitting in
a restaurant that is hotter than a sauna, trying to
find something on a menu that does not involve
eating sheep brains.

Like most stupid tourists in foreign countries,
my family spent a great deal of time traveling
great distances to look at camels, palaces and
other arbitrary objects which look impressive in
post cards but inevitably turn out to be excruciat-
ingly boring. Also, no matter where we went
(even if it was in the middle of the Sahara), a
horde of fully mobile merchants, speaking broken
English, were always at our side. These walking
thrift shops would follow us around for hours

insisting we buy useless trinkets\. And because I

wanted nothing more then to be left alone by '

these parasitic entrepreneurs, I bought every trin-
ket in sight. Trinkets I brought all the way
across the Atlantic in carry on luggage to store in
the back of the garage until my Mom forces me
at gun point to take them to the Salvation Army.

Compounding the problem of the t:rinket-wield-
ing mobile merchants was my immediate family
which carmot go more than five minutes without
experiencing some type of intra-farnily distur-
bance. Though these disturbances norrnally come *
in the form of verbal arguments or temper tan-_
trums, at one point, the family broke up into
teams and had a bench clearing brawl. A major
cause of family tension is that between my three
sisters and Mother, at any given moment. one of
them is afflicted with PMS. PMS, which literally
means "Periodic Mental Sickness," is a psycho-
logical state of mind occurring monthly in fe-
males. It is generally characterized by anti-social
behavior, violent mood swings, and sudden trips
to the drug store.

Due to space limitations and the fact that I'm

sick of writing, I must end this article now. In ',

TAX

from page 1

the city cannot tax a car if the owner
can show “sufficient evidence” that
property tax has been paid on that
vehicle in another locality. That

‘locality may be in Virginia or in
another state.

Local residents pay the city $5.50
for every $100 of the assessed value
of their car, a rate that City Manager
Joe King said may also be applied to
cars driven by local students.

In the past Lexington‘s city
council has overlooked strict
application of this code to W&L and
VMI students, but budget constraints
are forcing the council to increase its
tax base, said Derrick.

The mayor pointed out that 60
percent of the property in Lexington
is non-taxable, and that most of that
property is owned by W&L and
VMI. “It seems unfair to continue to
raise taxes on 40 percent of the
property," said Derrick.

“Students that are here for nine
months are citizens for nine
months," he continued. He said
that, since students utilize roads, the
police and other city services offered
to citizens. students virtually are
citizens. Accordingly, Derrick said
students should help support the
services they utilize.

But King emphasized that the
provision barring double taxation
does have some stipulations. First,
only payment of a personal property
tax at home, not any other sort of
tax related to ownership of a car,
will exempt students from taxation in
Lexington, he said.

Second, he said students must pay
the city the difference if the car tax
paid in their hometown is less that
the car tax levied in Lexington.

Third, all students, whether or not
they will be taxed, must register their
cars with the city of Lexington. At

Shaw visited the campus last

either be exempted from taxation or
required to make a payment.

Lexington Commissioner of
Revenue Courtney Baker will work
with the W&L administration this fall
to inform students that all cars must
be registered with the city and to
track down students who fail to
comply. “State law requires that
people register," said King. “But if
the commissioner is aware of
unregistered property, he can still
assess and tax that property.

“We’re hoping that everyone will
come forward," he continued. “If
they don't, I'm sure the council will
say we want this code to be followed
to the law." Derrick and King both
said students who fail to register
their cars will be breaking existing
Virginia law.

Dean John to take year off,

By Lee Fleming
Staff Reporter

Lewis John, who has served as dean of students at
Washington and Lee since 1969, will resign from that
position at the end of this academic year.

John. who also serves as a professor of politics, will
take a one year sabbatical during the 1990-91 year
before rejoining the faculty in the university’s School of

Commerce, Economics and Politics.

A 1958 graduate of W&L, John said there was no

single reason behind his decision.

“A number of long-range plans have come to an end,
” he said. “It just seemed like a good time."

University President John D. Wilson said John had
“been talking about it for a number of years.”

Wilson said a university search committee, chaired by
Director of Admissions William M. Hartog III, will
conduct “a national search" for a new dean of students.
The committee will also include three students, he said.

John earned a master's degree from Princeton
University and a doctorate from Syracuse University.

In an effort to ease the burden of
nish on freshmen. the Interfraternity
Council has reduced the number of
open houses from 12 to nine, council
president Kevin Nash said Monday.

Freshmen will sign up Sunday for
the nine houses of their choice, but a
computer program will randomly se-
lect the order in which rushees attend
the open houses. The first four rush
dates will be handled in a similar
fashion, with the computer matching
rushees’ preference cards to each fra-
ternities’ preference lists.

“The IFC decided to have no
more than nine open houses because
people were skipping the last three,"

Nash said. Rushees must attend at
least six open houses and a minimum
of five rush dates. Bids may be ex-
tended at the fifth rush date.

Associate Dean of Students for
Greek Affairs, Leroy C. “Buddy"
Atkins said he hopes the random or-
dering will alleviate some of the
pressure on freshmen to make defini-
tive first and second choices.

“It hurt the freshmen when they
signed up for a later nish date and
not the first or second." he said.
Not knowing the fraternities try to
gauge a freshman's interest and pre-
ference by how high he places a
house's msh date, often times rushees
get left out in the cold, he said.

“It's embarassing for a freshman
to be left standing ‘in a house expect-
ing a bid, and not getting one while

IFC restructures rush

they are being given out all around
him," Nash said.

“There have not been any prob-
lerns since everyone‘: been back,"
he said. “We've made it crystal
clear that we expect everyone to
abide by the rides. No house is go-
ing to get away with repeated viola-
tions this year."

To build a better working
relationship between the fraternities.
the IFC held a casual meeting Mon-
day to allow all of the house presi-
dents to becorrie acquainted and to
reinforce adherence to rush guide-
lines, Nash said.

“It would be the death penalty
for a fraternity to lose rush pn've-
leges. No one wants to see their life-
blood disappear, but it could be an
altemative," Nash said. '

Bio major interns with DOE

From News Releases

Washington and Lee senior Delia Faytli Truett was\
one of 80 students to take part in the U.S. Department
of Energy's Student Research Participation program this
surrirner. The program is operated by Oak Ridge Associ-
ated Universities‘ SciencelEngineering Education Divi-
sion.

Truett, a biology major from Friendsville, Tenn..
conducted her research at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory. During her 10-week appointment in the Chemical
Technology Division, Truett studied enzymological pro-
cessing of lignocellulosic substrates.

“Part of DOE's mission is to encourage student
interest in technical and scientific research and develop-
ment," Dr. Richard Wiesehuegel, program director said.
“The SRP program is an important vehicle for doing
that. The program lets us attract capable students in
science, math, computer science and engineering to meet
current and future labor market demands," Wiesehuegel
said, “and this becomes crucial when projections iridi-
cated fewer students are choosing academic programs in
science and engineering."

On a day-to-day basis students such as Truett con-
duct research on state-of-the—art equipment using ad-
vanced energy technologies under the guidance of DOE
and DOE laboratory staff. but it's the real-world work
environment that makes the impact. Comments from
students include statements such as “gained a better

view of the inner workings of groups and group dynam-
ics; ' "more aware of the importance of innovation.
d°di°ﬁli0n. and Pl’id¢;" “gained an extensive knowledge
of project -management policies and procedures;" and
"the most interesting aspect of the SRP research experi-
ence‘has been simply observing the steps involved in
carrying out the research in general."

The effects of the program are best summed up by
former students, Wiesehuegel said. “We have had more
than 2,000 participants since 1958. and statistics indicate
that 54 percent of former SRP participants work today in
research--mne percent of them in a federal government
facility," Wiesehuegel said. “Students still tell us the
program gives me some ideas as to what areas to ex-
plore in graduate school. and of course, this is part of
DOE's mission." 1

_ _T_he SRP program is open to graduate and upper
division undergraduate students majoring in engineering,
physical and life sciences. mathematics, computer science
or the social sciences. Applications outnumber appoint-
ments by about four to one, making competition strong
among candidates who possess the potential for success-
ful scientiﬁc careers.

The return

of the

wooden nickel

By Cary Baber
Staff Reporter

Three years ago the W&L Food
Service created point cards as an
alternative to the 20—meal plan. The
following year the Co-op began ac-
cepting points and business skyrock-
eted. Originally, one could pay for
an “odd" purchase, such as $1.45,
only by having one and a half points
taken off or by having one and a
quarter points taken off and paying
20 cents out of pocket.

Last year “as a service to the
students," said the University Food
Service Director Gerald Darrell, the
Co-op added “five cents a.ltema-
tives,“ ranging from bubble gum to
lollipops to peppermint patties, as
another option to maximize the effi-
ciency of the point card system. And
now, the W&L Food Service has
added a fourth option--tlre wooden
nickel.

The idea of a token to be used in
the Co-op and the GHQ belongs to
Rick Armstrong, manager of the Co-
op. The W&L Food Service had the

reusable tokens made at a cost of '

“one or two cents, a negligible a-
mount,” said Darrell, “to keep up
with students‘ requests.”

Another new addition to the Food
Service will be Washington and Lee
insulated travel mugs.

During the month of August, the
Food Service used approximately 800
styrofoam cups each day. Because
styrofoain is not biodegradable, many
other universities have converted to
paper cups. The W&L Food Service
has decided to respond to this envi-
ronmental issue, while at the same
time reducing drink prices, by selling
a reusable cup. The cups will be on
sale in front of the Co-op tomorrow
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. for $2.50, bev-
erage included.

Beginning Monday, the mugs will
be sold for $2.50 without beverage.
Reﬁlls. excluding milk, orange juice.
and alcoholic beverages, will cost 50
cents for as long as one owns the
mug. The mugs are self-service and
strictly non-transferrable.

Wooden nickels and insulated
travel mugs are signs that the W&L
Food Service has it's eye on the fu-
ture. And, the nickels are the next

step towards a “cashless society," a‘

concept centering around a debit card
that can be used for purchases in the
co-op. bookstore, GHQ, Dining Hall
and serve as an ID card for the li-
brary and certain other university

The number of burglaries of cars
and residences of W&L students is
expected to be unusually high this
weekend as fraternity rush gets
underway this weekend, said
Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
at the Interfratemity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

“We're going to see a big
increase in the number of larcenies
this weekend," said Beard. “They
(the burglaries) usually happen during
parties, especially when so many
houses are throwing parties at once."

“Please encourage all members of
the student body to remove all of
their valuables from their cars and to
lock their apartments," Beard said.
"Also, please make sure that students

A new law enacted by the Vir-
ginia State Legislature this summer
enables the courts to suspend the dri-
vers license of anyone convicted of
tmderage possession of alcohol, As-
sociate Dean of Students Leroy
“Buddy" Atkins said at the Inter-
fraternity Council meeting Tuesday
night.

If a person under the age of 16 is
convicted of underage possession of
alcohol, the court can prevent him
from obtaining his license for six
months, said Atkins. If the person is

visiting from other schools do the
same."

Beard said the police offer to

conduct, upon request, a “safety
inspection" of any house or
apartment to determine its

vulnerability to a potential burglar.

“These inspections will help you
keep your things safe and they'll
help us prevent these kinds of
crimes," Beard said.

Beard also outlined the new.
tougher amplified sound regulations.
Now if a fraternity receives a noise
violation,a citation from the police
for illegally loud noise, the house
will not be given a permit for such
loud noise for one week. in addition
to whatever penalties are levied by
either the courts or the IFC.

“We're going to be very fair and
consistent about how we enforce this

between 16 and 21, he can have his
license suspended for six months.

“I don't know to what extent this
law will be enforced," said Atkins.
“But you probably shouldn’t prance
down the middle of the road with
your 12-pack under your arm."

Atkins stressed that such new
laws compel fraternities to reevaluate‘
their policies for distributing alcohol
at parties.“If we get only one thing
accomplished this year, let's make
sure you (fraternities) understand that
you just can't give out alcohol to
people at parties," Atkins said. “You
just can't afford to be in the beer
business anymore."

day of spring term exams ended, but
he also said “We're really not
exactly sure who did it."

Nevertheless, under the terms of
the probation, Atkins said that, by
Oct. 1, the chapter “must identify
the members responsible for the
vandalism of the house. take
appropriate internal disciplinary
measures against them and assist the
house corporation in completing
necessary repairs."

On Wednesday, the living room
and entrance hall at the Phi Delt
house had already been repainted,
and Holland said painting and re-
carpeting upstairs would also soon be
completed. He said he was confident
his fraternity would make the Oct. 1
deadline for repairs.

Atkins said the deadline for
compliance with the university’s
Standards is the beginning of spring
term, when “there will be a hearing
to determine the chapter’s future at
Washington and Lee." But Atkins
said that, “under conditions of
unusual progress” and with the
approval of the Phi Delt house
corporation. the hearing may be held
as soon as Jan. 29. Holland said he's
confident his fraternity will be ready
to for a hearing at that time.

Chapter advisor Joseph Goldsten,
who is also on the board of Phi
Delt's house corporation, agreed with
Atkins that conditions at the house at
the end of the 1989-90 were
“unacceptable.“ But he said the
decision to hire a house mother is
not punitive action and called that
move “a positive approach."

“We want to make survival and
growth under the Renaissance work,"

he said, referring to W&L's
Fraternity Renaissance, the program
to restore the school's fraternity
houses that led to the adoption of the
Standards.

Under the Renaissance program.
all houses which are renovated by
the university will have to hire a
resident manager, Goldsten pointed
out. And he predicted that most
houses will hire house mothers to fill
that role. “The sooner we get in line
the better,” he said.

Mata McGuire, a former restaurant
owner who was the house mother at
W&L's chapter of Zeta Beta Tau for
six years, was hired by the Phi Delt
house corporation over the summer.
Goldsten said she, in addition to
living in the house, will attend all
house activities. But, he said, she
will not be a chaperon; for example,
she may choose to attend only part
of a party at the house, he said.

Although she has only just begun
her duties, McGuire said she doesn't
see any problems.

“I expected resentment,"
McGuire said, because of the
circumstances under which she was
hired. “But the boys seem very
responsible. I haven't seen a bad
apple in the bunch."

Atkins emphasized that the
probation Phi Delt is under is not the
result of any action by the
Interfratemity Council. He said
Tuesday that it is possible that the
IFC will also take action against Phi
Delt, but Holland, who is a member
of the IFC’s Judicial Board,
Wednesday told the Phi that the IFC
will not take any action against his
fraternity.

new policy," said Beard. “However,
the decision about whether to close
down a party is up to the discretion
of the officer on the scene."

Although noise permits extend
until midnight, Beard said, an officer
has the option to close the party
down before then if he considers the
party to be “out of control."

“The only problem I leave with
that is the possibility that a house
could be cleared of a noise violation
in court, would the house still not be
able to receive a noise permit?"
asked IFC Vice—I-‘resident Hunt

_ Washington and Lee University
students, faculty and Lexington
residents experienced firsthand Soviet
perestroika last year when three
Soviet exchange students attended
. W&L. This year, the Russian studies
program will be further developed by
new faculty member Zhanna
Dologopolova.

W&L contacted Dologopolova at
a teacher's conference in Washington,
» D.C. last December. After visiting

It’s as if I entered a fairy tale,"
Dologopolova said. She has explored
much of Lexington on foot, as she
enjoys walking.

She will teach first- and third-
year Russian and the Russian
literature in translation course. In
addition to teaching, Dologopolova
will help prepare W&L students for
exchange trips to the Soviet Union.
Last year, a group of W&L students
travelled to the Soviet Union for the
ﬁrst time, as a part of the exchange
program that brought Soviet students
here.

Dologopolova says she would
love to return to the Soviet Union to
visit, but would not retum there to
live.

Last season, Old Dominion Athletic Conference prog-
nosticators picked the Washington and Lee Generals to
finish fifth in the conference. The Generals responded ‘by
finishing the season 5-3-1, tied for third in the confer-
ence. The Generals ended the season with a foungzime
winning streak.

The 1939 Generals will be hard pressed to prove that
last year's performance was no fluke. The will need
healthy contributions from the 35 returning lctterwinners
from last year's squad to improve on last year's record.
Head coach Gary Fallon is excited about what this year's
team is capable of doing.

And for good reason.

Offensively, both starting quarterback Philip Sampson
and backup Chris Srnythe, senior roommates, are back to
guide the Generals again. Sampson started in the Ge-
nerals’ two-quarterback system and completed 55 percent
of his passes for over 1,000 yards. Smythe, primarily a
scrambler, completed an outrageous 77 percent of his
passes (27-35).

Back are junior tailback Mason Pope and senior full-
back Russell Crosby, a two-year starter. They were last
year's top two rushers. Pope took the ball into the end
zone five times. Although both are experienced, they will
shoulder almost all of the Generals _ground work. "We
don't have a lot of depth in the backfield as far as
experience is concerned,"said Fallon. “We’ll work Kirk
Sohonage at both fullback and tailback this year.”

When Sampson and Smythe throw the ball this season,
they will be throwing to an experienced, deep group of
[fleet-footed receivers. On one side, juniors Craig Irons
and Chris Acebal will share the split end spot. Irons led
the team in receptions and receiving yards last year. On
the other side will be junior speedster Carl Gilbert, an

Polo ready despite losses

From W&L Sports Information

There are two ways to look at
dire straits. It can either be the
end of your world, or, especially
if you're Washington and Lee
water polo coach, it can be the
start of a new one.

With what Remillard is facing
for the upcoming season, he
easily could be preparing his
samurai sword. Gone are the
team's top three offensive threats
from the last two years. Departed
seniors Dave Dietz, Dave Reavy
and Moose Herring — all three of
whom were all-conference first-
team selections in '88 -
accounted for 134 of the
Generals’ 178 goals last year.
Reavy and Dietz also were named
All—Americans for the second
year in a row.

That, however, is the past.
And while the loss of 75 percent
of your offense in one fell swoop
might seem like a good reason
for an exit stage left, Remillard is
happy right where his team is.

“Whenever you have large
losses from graduation, you have
mixed feelings," he said. “Sure,
you're losing some talent, but it's
also exciting opportunity for some
underclassmen to move into
bigger roles.

“I'm very excited about our
recruits and the people we have
coming back. I think this group
is going to surprise people with
how quickly they blend into that
higher level. There will be no
superstars. We will have to rely
on each player to reach all of his
potential."

While the losses might lead
people to believe the Generals
will field a team of relative no-
names for 1989, nothing could be
further from the truth. The
strength, most certainly, will be
defense. Senior David Olson,
arguably one of the top three or
four goalies in the East last year,
is back again as W&L‘s final line
of defense. Playing primarily in
the deep end, Olson made 77
saves last year.

The Generals also will benefit
from some developing young
talent that now will have to come
to the fore. Sophomore Alan
Herrick showed signs of
becoming one of W&L‘s best-
ever defensive players last year,
and Remillard is expecting him to

Now, head coach Susan Dittman
and her team want more.

Dittman, who led the Generals to
a fifth-place finish in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference last
year, said she was pleasantly
surprised by last year's results and is
ready for new challenges this year.

True, W&L will sorely miss the
services of departed seniors Vanessa
Hartman (All-ODAC), co-captain
Melissa Thrasher and triple threat
Amy Smith. But the returnees could
more than make up for the
departures. Leading the way is two-
year team MVP Lisa Jay, a junior

“This year we can legitimize Beth Anne Lamb and junior Kliainla

contributions.

Dittrnari, is experience. Even with the

The Generals will need to
find some goal—scorers, though.
Only five players who actually
scored a goal last year return to
this year's team. Of the returnees,
Smith and Davis could be the
most promising future scorers.
Smith was a high school All-
American in water polo, while
Davis was a three-year lettennan
in water polo at California's
Sunny Hills High School.

Some needed punch should
come from the incoming recruits,
as well, Remillard said.

Hodges and senior J.Wayne Burris.

Gilbert will also handle the kick—off returns. In his
freshman year, Gilbert.retumed a kick-off 95 yards for a
touchdown against Randolph-Macon.

The offensive line is where the Generals were hardest
hit by graduation. Said Fallon, “We graduated four
people on the offensive line who played a lot of foot-
ball. Mike Magoline and Mike Holiefield alternated at
left guard. At right guard, Julian Philips (All-ODAC) is
gone, and at right tackle, David Surface (All-ODAC) is
gone as well. We have to find replacements for them.

"We'll probably be bigger on the offensive line this
year, but I'm not sure we've got the seasoning that we
had last year."

Juniors Rob Christensen and Frank Sudell will anchor
the line this season. They should receive help from
sophomores Jim Henry and Rob Thomas, juniors Rob
Robertson and Mike DeMelfi and senior Rich Poli.

Defensively, despite the loss of two All-Americans, the
Generals look strong. Last season W&L gave up just
over two touchdowns a game. All-Americans Jim John-
son (DT) and Tom Skeen (LB, P), bolstered the defense.
Skeen is second in interceptions on W&L‘s career list.
He led the team in tackles for three years. Also gone is
LB-DT Hughes Melton. Melton had seven tackles for
losses last season, third on the team.

But don't fret for the Generals yet. Back is the entire
starting secondary, including all—ODAC selections Bland
Warren and Bobby Rimmer, both senior comerbacks.
Joining them will be junior safeties Clark “Boomer"
Wight and Brad Miller. The entire secondary from last
year was in the top ten in tackles. Wight was second on
the team in interceptions last season. Two freshmen
should also see time in the secondary this year, Juarez
Newsome at strong safety and Don Dempsey at free
safety.

The defensive line will be anchored by tackles Dave
Radulovic and Scott Silverman, who led all returning
linemen in tackles last year. Also back to shore up the
defense is stand-out linebacker Mike Pack, who was
second on the team in tackles.

Said Fallon, “We won't be very big on the defensive

,.. 

said her 1989 club already should
have more volleyball experience than
any other team she's had.

“Our offensive system has been
put in," Dittman said. “We won't
have to spend so much time trying to
figure out who goes where. We
certainly have the potential to be
better than we've been. The players
we have coming in to the team are
even better players than we've had in
the past, and they're all definitely
more experienced."

The healthy stock on hand has
Dittman ready for some tangible
improvement. The Generals finished
fifth in the ODAC regular season,
but injuries during the ODAC
Tournament made getting to the
semifinals a near impossibility. This
year, Dittman would like to see her
team work its way into the top four
in the conference.

"It will be very challenging to try
to finish third," she said. “The
conference is getting more and more
strong coaches that will make for
more and more strong teams. But we
deﬁnitely want to move up one or
two places in the standings. I think
the character of the W&L student,

pcong year :

line, but we'll have the quickest ends I've seen in my
twelve years here."

Occupying one end will be John McCal1um, a sopho— '7

more. At the other end will be junior Caner Quayle.
Backing them up will be converted defensive back Scott
Williamson.

“We're’not overly big on our line,_but we are real _
heavy on hustle and effort and attitude," said Fallon.

Aiding Pack at linebacker will be sophomore Trey
Cox, who, according to Fallon, has shown signs -of _
becoming a strong linebacker.

Another returning weapon the Generals will be looking
forward to utilizing is junior placekicker Carter Quayle.
Quayle, a junior, earned All-America status last season
by connecting on 10 of 12 field goals and scoring a
team-high 44 points.

However, Quayle will have to deal with a new rule.
This season, kickers are not allowed to use tees on ﬁeld
goals and extra points. .

Another new rule that will come into play this year
deals with penalties on the defense _on plays where the
offense scores a touchdown. In the past. the touchdown
would count and the penalty be assessed on the kickoff.
Now the offense has the option to enforce the penalty on ,
the extra point, moving the ball half to distance to th
goal or enforce it on the kickoff. The new rule coupl
with the no-tee rule could induce an increase in th
number of two—point conversions attempted by team
around the country.

Fallon says his team is ready for this season's opener
at Emory and Henry. Said Fallon, "We try to take it I,
one game at a time. We want to block out all the other

The brutal slate, which includes 11

the Generals overall record, but it
shouldn't disrupt their level of
improvement.

And that foundation could be the

From W&L Sports Information

With the 1988 season having
produced four All-Old Dominion
Athletic Conference players. including
the school's first—ever first-team
selection in the sport, as well as
ODAC Coach-of-the-Year honors for
head coach Janine Hathom, the
outlook for the Washington and Lee
women's soccer 1989 season could
be termed bright. ‘

Even Hathom, whose program is
in just its third year of play in the
ODAC, is willing to admit the
immediate future looks very bright.

“I really can't wait for this
season to get started,” said the
Generals‘ third-year coach. “We have
a lot of work to do, but I think it
should be a lot of fun, too. We've
had so much growth so far. I'm
really excited about our potential. I
think our ‘skill level could be another
level above last year."

The reason for such excitement is
the return of 13 lettermen, along with
a promising group of freshmen. Back
are defensive standouts Sarah Allen,
Beth Stutzmarm and Nancy Mitchell.
Both Allen, a senior. and Mitchell, a
sophomore, were All—ODAC
selections, and Mitchell, W&L‘s
Female Freshman Athlete-of-the-Year
last year, was a first-team All-ODAC
selection, a first-time honor for a
W&L women's soccer player.

“Once again we should be strong
defensively," Hathom said. “My
coaching philosophy is to emphasize
defense, and we have some very
strong players there again."

just as much a source of confidence.
Junior Sherri Brown, who played
every minute of last season in goal
for the Generals, is back. She made
169 saves last year and allowed just
2.75 goals per game.

The forward line also should be
strong for the coming season. The
Generals return six of their top seven
scorers from the 1988 season,
including senior Catherine Baillio.
W&L‘s leading‘ scorer each of the
last two seasons. Sophomore Ashley
Gray, the second—leading scorer for
the Generals last fall, and senior
Joelle Jackson, a co-captain along
with Allen, should bolster W&L‘s
offensive attack.

Hathom said the area of concern
will be midfield. Only two proven
performers, sophomore letterwinner
Morgan Warner and junior reserve
Paige Kilian, are back for 1989.
Warner, who started 15 of 16 games
last season, was third on the team in
scoring last season, while Kilian saw
action in 14 games in 1988.

With the defensive and offensive
strengths already on reserve, Hathom
knows the 1989 season could be

another turning point for the young
W&L women's soccer program. In
1987. W&L‘s first year of play in
the ODAC, the Generals went 2-8-3.
Last year, the Generals were a game
shy of .500, recording a 7-9 record
and finishing fourth in the ODAC
regular season. The Generals were
edged by Sweet Briar in the first
round of the ODAC Tournament, but
the remarkable turnaround earned
Hathom ODAC Coach of the Year
honors.

Improving will be made even
more difficult by a challenging 1989
schedule. There will be nary a rest
stop throughout the 17-game regular-
season slate.

“Our schedule is going to be
really tough,“ Hathom said. “There
will be no game that's going to be
easy. There should be some games
we should be able to win, and there
will be some games where we will
have to work hard just to get into a
position to win. But I think this
group is up for that challenge.
They're very excited and gung-ho.

They’re ready for that level of
competition. ' '
Making the future look even

brighter is a promising group of
freshman. Twelve first-year players
are looking to make contributions
right away, and Hathom says some
will have a chance to do just that.

The Generals also will need some
leadership, and Hathom is confident
in her returning veterans, especially
captains Jackson and Allen, to supply
the guidance her team of 21
underclassmen will need.

And where the Generals could be
is the upper echelon of the ODAC.
Hathom is willing to be patient, but
she can't dampen her enthusiasm for
the 1989 campaign.

“We're going to have more of a
shot this year," she said. “We could
end up surprising some of the upper
echelon teams. I'd like to shoot for
the top three in the conference. That
would be nice. But we have a lot of
the finer details to work on. It's a lot
of pressure in a way, but pressure
makes diamonds, doesn't it?"

From W&L Sports Information

Heavy casualties due to
graduation, a murderous schedule,
and the prospect of an expanded and
soccer-strengthened Old Dominion
Athletic Conference await head coach
Rolf Piranian and his Washington
and Lee men's soccer team in 1989.

Piranian, who enters his 14th
season as the W&L soccer boss, is
not crying the blues, however. He
likes his players, and with a few
breaks along the way, he also likes
their chances at making a run for the
conference title.

The potential for Piranian is to
shed tears of dismay. Gone arefive
senior starters, including co-captain
and All-ODAC back Sid Udicious,
co-captain Mike Veliuona and leading
scorer Johnny Sarber. The five
departures took with them 20 years
of collegiate soccer experience and
18 varsity letters.

But it's all water under the bridge
for Piranian. With a schedule that
includes some of the top-ranked
teams in the nation and a brutal
conference slate, there's no time to
worry about the past. The 16-date
schedule is dotted with traditional
regional strongmen like Guilford,
Mary Washington and North Carolina
Wesleyan, in addition to an early-
season weekend two-fer in Baltimore
against Johns Hopkins and Camegie-
Mellon.

Six seniors should ﬁgure
prominently in the W&L fortunes in
1989, and leading that group is two-
year starter Patrick Brown, who holds
the W&L all—time record for assists
and was the Generals‘ leading scorer
in 1987. Joining Brown on the list of

championship on the final weekend

at working their way up to the top
of the heap in the ODAC will be
those veterans, along with a host of
talented younger players and
newcomers. As a freshman last
season, midfielder David Hooker had
three goals and one assist in 13
games, and he is expected to
strengthen the midfield along with
sophomore letterrnan David De Falco.

Up front, the Generals should get
support from junior David Gilmore,
who had two goals and two assists in
eight games last season before being
sidelined with injuries, and
sophomore lettermen Bobby
Weisgerber and Chris Miyamoto. In
addition to Caggiano and Eckman,
the W&L defense should be bolstered
by two lettermen, junior Duke Dillard
and sophomore John Miller.

There also is a strong group of
freshmen slated to arrive in

Lexington for the coming season.

Easing the uncertainty has ‘to be
the retum of Pringle and Bull in

Piranian said.

If all pans out and the breaks are
with the Generals, the early warning
signals for the ’89 season may not
yield any discouraging results.
Piranian likes the opportunities the
upcoming campaign holds.

“We're the only ODAC team to
lose players to graduation this year,
so we might not get much respect,"
he said. “But we had a good three
weeks of spring practice. So if we
can answer some questions early, we
can be a real decent club."

Paradise opens its gates to Lexington

Local merchant combines shopping with metaphysical concepts

 

By Genienne Mongno
Associate Editor

If you‘re in the mood to shop,
browse or just relax in a stress-free
enviomment — go to Paradise.

Paradise, located at 16 N. Main
St., opened its gates to Lexington on
Aug.29 as a gift shop specializing in
metaphysical merchandise.

All the items in the store,
including a variety of crystals,
incense, New Age music and books
on personal growth and development,
are intended to be spiritually
uplifting. However, Paula Weiss, who
owns the store with her husband
Steve Martin, said the store isn't
purely a metaphysical shop. Paradise
also features a selection of cards,
stuffed toys, jewelry. candles, and
clothing.

“Basically it’s just a fun gift
shop, but undemeath that is a lot of
love and a lot of spiritual presence,"
said Weiss.

Weiss, who with Martin
directed a center for well—beir1g in
Pennsylvania before coming to
Lexington, said she was told a store

like Paradise would not be successful
with the largely conservative student
population at Washington and Lee.

“I think today‘s students,
including the Washington and Lee
students I've observed. are unique
and individual and want to be
accepted as individuals and to do
their own thing," she said.

“They're exploring and they're
very alive. That's my perception and
that’s one of the reasons I decided to
go ahead with the store."

' Weiss said she also believes
there , is a strong undercurrent of
interest in spiritual matters in the
Rockbridge area.

“Everywhere you go there are
normal people — and I'm not talking
spaced out California people — but
normal housewives (who are
interested)" she said.

Weiss said so far her gamble
has paid off. Business has been “far
beyond" her expectations and she
said people from “every level of
community here" are showing

interest in the store.
“There's something for everyone,
that’s how we wanted to make it."

Above, Weiss shows J.Scott Fowler how to get the most bell for his
buck. At right, one feature at Paradise includes a peaceful seating
area centered around a heavily toliaged water fountain. The area is
open to anyone who ventures in. Staff photos by Cary Baber.

she said.

"the merchandise in Paradise
comes from all over the world so
certain items are truly one of a kind,
said Weiss. She said she buys for the
store by trying to “look through the
eyes of the students and tourists"
and is also open to suggestions from
customers about what they would
like to see.

Weiss said she also tries to keep
most of the items in an affordable
price range.

“You don’t want a store that
people are only able to come in and
look at like a museum. You want
them to come in, have fun and know
they can have anything in the store,”

she said.

Paradise is also a place where
people can go “just to be in the
space," said Weiss.

‘Customers are invited to relax in
a seating area centered around a
fountain and exotic plants.

“I'm interested in something
different, something that’s exotic,"
she said. “People have told me it’s,
not Lexington, and I said, ‘No, it’s
Paradise, and it’s meant to be
something different."’

Paradise is open Monday through
Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m..
Thursday through Saturday the hours
are 10, a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday hours
are 12 to 5 p.m.
