Report: EC breaks constitution

By Rick Peltz
Staff Reporter

This year's Executive Committee
has gone into executive session in
several instances when it was not
allowed by the student body constitu-
tion, according to a report submitted
to the EC Monday night.

The Constitutional Revisions Com-
mittee submitted to the Executive
Committee Monday its proposals to
amend the student body constitution,
which included a clariﬁcation of
executive session.

The proposal allows the EC to
hold closed—door, executive sessions
for honor investigations and trials,
committee appointment interviews,
disciplinary hearings, and discipline in

honor-related matters as outlined in
White Book Section 0.

The measure forbids closed—door
or executive sessions for budget hear-
ings and deliberations, and committee
appointrnet deliberations.

“Past and present Executive Com-
mittees have chosen to disregard the
constitution on this issue,” reads the
revisions corr1rnittee’s rationale. The
EC “has seen fit to change the rules,
and the present guidelines have be-
come irrelevant.”

The committee said executive
session was invoked for an FD
budget hearing earlier this year.

Second-year law Rep. Mark Cobb,
who phoned in the deciding vote last
week to close EC—elect committee
appointment deliberations, objected
that the proposal allowed no “flex-

ibility.” If personality conflicts arose
in an interview, he reasoned, or the
interviewee provided information he
deemed confidential, the EC would be
unable to consider it in open delibera-
tions.

Revisions committee member
Walter Scott told Cobb, “I wish
you’d voted to have those delibera-
tions open. You voted against the
constitution.’ '

He explained that if open delib-
erations had been unsuccessful, the
revisions committee might have
reconsidered that part of the proposal.
However, since deliberations were
voted closed, the revisions committee
made a decision based on the seem-
ing intent of the constitution.

The confidentiality in disciplinary
matters, Falk explained, is to allow

the EC to conduct an investigation,
but if action is taken the EC must
“fully describe all facts and cir-
cumstances surrounding the disposi-
tion of the matter" in its regular
meeting.

Other proposals concerned suc-

elections to fill vacant offices_, adjust-
ments to allow earlier elections, and

the ﬁscal role of the Publications
Board as an “umbrella” organization.

The revisions committee also
proposed a revitalized University
Lectures Committee to coordinate
guest lecturers and administer the
anticipated Telford Grant for lec-
turers. That proposal is not a con-
stitutional amendment.

EC Vice President—elect Raymond
Welder said that he hopes the EC
will leave the Constitutional Re-
visions Cornmittee’s proposals for
consideration next year.

Constitutional procedure requires
a two-thirds vote of the EC to send
an amendment to referendum, where
two—thirds of the student body, with
at least half voting, may adopt it.

The EC—elect posted their com-
mittee appointments Monday night.

Members’ voting records were also
made public.

The EC gave Kathleen Duwel the
Student Activities Board chair, 6-5,
with William Jones unanimously
chosen as vice chair. Charles
Krariich made Contact chairman. 9-2.
Other chairs went unanimously to
Andrew Gaffney, Voting Regulations
Board; Robert Shelton, Financial
Relations Committee; Thomas Spur-
geon, Student Conduct Committee
(Spurgeon abstaining): and John
Donaldson, Mock Convention. The
Emergency Loan Committee chair
went to Jeffrey Rogers.

The EC—elect decided to wait in
ﬁlling these positions: SAB opera-
tions director; Fancy Dress chairman,
vice chairman and auditor; and Mock
Convention secretary.

IFC votes to
change rules

Social probation guidelines
and rush sites discussed

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

The Interfratemity Council took
the first step to change the definition
of social probation at its Tuesday
night meeting, and the six houses that
will be under renovation during fall
rush reached an agreement to use a
lottery system to distribute meetirng
places for rush functions.

The IFC voted unanimously to
send a proposed amrnendment to the
IFC by-laws to the Student Affairs
Committee for approval.

If approved, the arnmendment
would change the restrictions imposed
on houses while they are on social
probation. The amrnendrnent would
prohibit more than 25% of the mem-
bership of the fraternity house to
gather outside the house for any non-
university sponsored function of a
social nature.

This would supercede the current
by-law which states that no more
than 5 members of the fraternity may
gather for a non—university sanctioned

function.

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
that this change comes in the wake
of Phi Kapppa Sigma having their
social probation extended by the
SAC.

Admitting that Phi Kapp broke the
actual letter of the law by having
more than 5 brothers together while
they were on social probation, Lweis
said that the IFC had let Phi Kapp
off because it did not feel that they
had broken with the spirit of the rule.

Lewis said that fraternities must
start following the rules in the consti-
tution and that the IFC must start
enforcing them.

“But,” he added, “If we believe
that the rule sucks, we've got to
change it.”

Associate Dean of Students for
Fraternity Affairs Leroy “Buddy”
Atkins, argued in the meeting for a
tougher rule. ,

He said that he felt both the cur-
rent rule and the proposed amend-
ment were not strong enough.

W&L Gives Delta Gamma will colonize in Fall

$100,000
to city

By Fraser Bowen
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee has given a
$100,000 gift to the city of Lex-
ington, announced Mayor H.E.
“Buddy" Derrick at the May 3 Lexi-
ngton City Council meeting.

“I think that this heralds a new
relationship between the city and
Washington and Lee,” said Derrick.

The gift was approved by W&L’s
Board of Trustees at the board’s
meeting in February, according to
university Treasurer Larry W. Broom-
all.

The board’s action provides for a
onetime unrestricted capital grant to
the city. It is intended to recompense
the city for lost tax revenue.

Broomall said that the grant is
essentially in response to a proposal
by the city that the university pur-
chase bonds for the new consolidated
city-county high school, the plans for
which were approved in a Rockbridge
County referendum last spring.

Broomall said, at the time the
high school was originally proposed,
the university thought it would be
unwise to invest in such a low-yield
venture.

The grant to the city is un-
restricted, so the city may use it in
any way that it chooses, however,
Derrick said he would like to “ear-
mark” the inoncy to go towards
construction of the consolidated high-
school.

The consolidated high school is
expected to cut the combined costs
for local high school education by 50
percent.

After five months of deliberation and a
January decision to delay colonization, Delta
Gamma has agreed to return to Washington and
Lee to colonize in the fall in hopes of becom-
ing W&L’s fourth sorority, according to Associ-
ate Dean of Students Leroy “Buddy” Atkins.

Atkins said he received a letter of confir-
mation late last week from DG formally accept-
ing the university's invitations to colonize here,
although a 15-member DG interest group has
been meeting since January in order to increase
interest among the unaffiliated women on
campus in a new sorority.

In the letter, DG President Maureen Syring
said that although “the numbers have quite
frankly been disappointing, the determination
this group has exhibited has been impressive.”

Syring went on to say that DG held a
national Council meeting in late April, with the
colonization at W&L a major part of the agen-
da.

There the Council voted unanimously to
support a DG colonization in the fall, using the
local interest group as the core of women who
will help with this effort.

As part of their colonization, DG will hold
a rush in the fall for all independent upperclass-
men. It will then rush again in the winter with
the other three sororities currently on campus,
Kappa Alpha Theta, Chi Omega, and Kappa
Kappa Gamma.

According to DG Colonization Coordinator
Kitty Beatty, DG has not yet set a date for its
fall rush. Beatty said that the dates will be set
in accordance with the W&L and DG calendars.

Interest group President Elizabeth Besen-
felder expressed a concern that, because DG’s
installation period is 12 weeks long, the girls

who pledged in the fall might not be active
members by winter, or they would be initiating
around exam time.

Beatty said that the DG pledge period had
an amount of flexibility, although its too early
to say if DG will attempt to initiate before
Christmas break.

Beatty also said that the colony should be
able to meet certain standard requirements
before it is installed. The requirements basi-
cally deal with the colony's readiness to be a
chapter, which includes its financial situation,
mles and by-laws, OffIC6l'S and its philanthropic
activities.

DG will be the only sorority allowed to
rush upperclassrnen in the fall. In the mean
time DG has requested the names and addresses
of all unaffiliated women and permission to
contact them over the summer with information
and specific dates that DG will be on campus.

Newspaper adds to Smith fund

The Tampa (Fla) Tribune and its parent
company, the Media General chain, have
contributed $16,000 to the Todd C. Smith

v Memorial Fellow-
ship Fund at
Washington and Lee.

As of April, 392
donors have con-
tributed $53,553 to
the fund. The goal is
to collect $100,000.

“We are delight-
ed by the gift from
Media General and
The Tampa Trib-
une,” said W&L
Director of Develop-
ment Lex McMillan. “It is a very beautiful
and generous gesture. We are grateful.”

 

Smith

The fund was established earlier this
year by the family and friends of Smith, a
1983 graduate of W&L, after he was tor-
tured and murdered by terrorists in the drug-
producing Huallaga region of Peru.

The fellowship is designed to help aspir-
ing journalists at W&L to become foreign
correspondents by providing a stipend to
travel and study in the country of their
choice for a specified amount of time.

The fellowship is open to any rising
junior or senior enrolled at W&L. The
recipient’s research and study will focus on
a topic of current interest and importance
and is expected to produce a journalistic
work that the Tribune will consider for
publication.

Smith, a former editor of The Ring-tum
Phi and a reporter for the Tribune, was
killed while investigating the Peruvian drug
trade.

As was reported in November in the Phi,
Smith decided to devote his vacation from

the paper to travel to Peru, because the
paper had refused to assign the story to him,

W&L,” Syring said in her letter. Atkins said
that university's response will be “great.”

According to Besenfelder, 12 members of
the interest group have formally comrriitted
themselves to nish DG in the fall and that at
least three more girls probably will. The group
currently holds meetings every week and tries
to recruit interested females and “get ourselves
known on campus,” said Besenfelder. The
interest group also has a DG advisor, Lexington
resident Patricia Gamer.

Besenfelder, who is one of the founders of
the interest group, said facetiously “We're the
scraggler group," explaining that all 15 mem-
bers were either not extended bids or did not
sign preference cards.

However, Besenfelder said that the girls who
did not get bids had indicated to the other three

OPINION

EC needs to read
the constitution

Last week the Executive Committee-elect voted 6-5 not
to open to the public deliberations on committee
appointments and went into executive session. The Student
Body Constitution states that executive sessions — defined
as a “private meeting of the EC”in which the “door is to
be closed at all times” - are to be called only in cases of
honor violations. Something is wrong with this picture.

This action by the EC could not have come at a better
time for the Constitutional Revisions Committee to prove its
point.

According to the proposals for change to the constitution
submitted by the committee Monday night the EC has
“chosen to disregard the constitution” on the issue of
executive session.

The proposals refer to last fall when the EC granted to
Alex Hitz, then Fancy Dress chairman, an executive session
to present the FD budget. Budget hearings are not to be
held in private. All members of the W&L community have
the right to know how its committees are spending their
money.

When the EC voted to close deliberations last week it
acted against the constitution. A vote to open the
deliberations should not have been taken. Such a meeting
should be assumed open. The proposal clearly defines which
meetings are to be private and which are to be public.The
only meetings that could be held behind closed doors are:
honor violations and investigations, disciplinary hearings and
interviews for committee appointments, and these only on a
two-thirds vote.

Deliberations on appointments, budget hearings and
budget deliberations could never be held in Executive
Session, as it should be.

The members of the EC who last week voted to keep the
deliberations closed ought to read the constitution. The
committee needs to be congratulated for its effort to remind
the EC that they are not separate, but are a part of, the
student body. And they, too, have rules to follow.

Welcome back
home, y’a||

This weekend, a whole ton of alumni are coming back to
W&L to visit. Ladies and gentlemen, glad to have you here.

Without doubt, W&L is a different place than the one
you attended. For better or worse, however, we think you’ll
notice a lot has remained the same.

On the front page, we ran a story about how some people
think the EC is behaving incorrectly. If you ask around,
you’ll probably ﬁnd out that fraternities feel harassed by the
administration, and the faculty think fraternities destroy
academic integrity.

Students think the Lexington police are facists, and the
cops think we’re overbearing, spoiled brats.

During the class registration period, the line outside Prof.
Futch’s office is longer than the football field and, the
philosophy department is almost empty.

C-School majors think everyone else is slack. Everyone
else thinks C-School majors are overrated.

The current editorial board of The Ring-tum Phi has been
in place for only three weeks, and we’ve already had to
issue two corrections.

Sound familiar? We hope so. Welcome back to W&L.

Quote of the Week

We go to a private institution, so we don't have all of our
constitutional rights.

— EC President Willard Dumas, valiantly trying to
explain on a recent call-in show why some campus
organizations can be closely regulated by the EC, in seeming
contradiction to the U.S. Constitution.

MY VIEW

By J. Cameron Humphries

The times, indeed, they are a changin’. Who,
for instance, would ever have guessed that The
Ring Tum Phi would ask me to write for them, or
that a republican, God-fearing President could be
soft on a communist. And yet, while the Phi may
have its reservations in asking me to write this
article, it seems that George Bush has no
reservations whatsoever in embracing that
un—conirnie communist, Mikhail Gorbachev.

Mikhail Gorbachev, or Mickey (Mickey
Mouse?) for short, has become the most ironic of
world leaders - almost every claim or promise
he has made serves as little more than an ironic
reminder of communism’s breakdown. Not long
ago Gorbachev stated that the communists would
never relinquish their monopoly of power in the
U.S.S.R., today Article Six of their constitution
has been abolished. He firmly asserted that
German reunification was “not part of the
historical agenda”; it is now historical reality.
And Gorbachev once rejected the idea of the
united Germany joining NATO; the Soviets now
say that Europe will be much safer with Germany
inside NATO instead of outside it. Oh, the times
they are changing, and very quickly.

But more than the old Bob Dylan song, the
current events in Europe and the Soviet Union
invite comparison with the events occurring in
France two hundred years earlier. At this time a
young leader, whose distinguishing characteristic

~was not a spot on his head, but his shortness in
height, was all the rave among the liberals in
Europe. That liberal among liberals, Ludwig van

Beethoven, even composed a symphony in his
honor. All of Europe hoped that the revolution
would establish the freedoms France’s and
England's philosophers had espoused. And all of
Europe looked to Napoleon to extend them across
the continent. Were Time magazine in print in
1799, Napoleon Bonaparte (not George
Washington or Benjamin Franklin) most likely
would have been their Man of the Century.

Gorbachev’s centralization
of power remains largely
ignored...WhiIe in the United
States, our Congress is
planning to dismantle the
world’s most powerful
armed forces (our own).

Yet he did not remain in the liberals‘ favor for
long. He centralized power under his authority,
then marched his formidable army east to
Moscow. Though he did codify laws and remove
hundreds of tiny monarchies, he did very little to
spread liberalism throughout Europe. Instead, he

sat in Moscow for one long, hot summer and _

waited for the Russian people to surrender to his
will.

They did not.

Now, two hundred years later, the people of
Europe believe that Mikhail Gorbachev will extend
the rights and freedoms of the French and English
philosophers into a nation whose people have
never known them. Gorbachev’s centralization of

power remains largely ignored - crowning
himself emperor cost Napoleon his symphony

While in the United States, the our Congress i’
planning to dismantle the world’s most powerfu

armed forces (our own). NATO’s members now
question the purpose of NATO’s existence. An

the world is dancing in the street, rejoicing 
Soviet Uriion’s goodwill. All this while the littl

communist, Gorbachev, continues to sit in
Moscow, not acting, but waiting.

Sure, Gorby has pulled a few troops out of
Hungary, but now they sit closer to home (where,
they are needed) in such pro-Soviet regions as
Armenia and Lithuania. Once he did promise td‘
dismantle his governments’ control of the Sovieg
economy, but today he preaches not glasnost, bu
“gradualism.” No shots were fired when Sovieb
tanks rolled through the streets of Vilinus, but
then neither were they rolled through the streets
Prague. Mickey knows that one does not have tr)
ﬁre a gun to effectively threaten another ‘With:-it.
Furthermore, though a surrirnit with President*'Buslt
is scheduled for later next month, Gorbachev ‘ha
already rescinded his offer of certain arms contro
concessions with the United States. We in the;
United States look to Mikhail for action and
progress. And all the while, Gorby sits irﬁ
Moscow, merely waiting as his promises of
liberalism stand idly by.

If he continues to wait, and we continue to ac‘
in this present capacity of unilateral disarmament,
Gorbachev may find that he need not retreat from
Moscow, nor that he need succeed in Liringing the
West, east. He may instead ﬁnd the great plains‘
of Europe lie open, sans any deterrent from his, or!
more likely some other Soviet’s, extending that
great protectorate freedom, communism, westward.‘
While we in the U.S.are left watching idly by.

MY VIEW
By John P. Roche

To say there are more Marxists at
an armual meeting of the American
Sociological Association than there
are now is Eastern Europe is merely
to utter a truism. But the closer you
look at the views of these self-styled
American radicals, the more you have
to wonder about two crucial ques-
tions. First, what precisely do they
mean when they call themselves
“Marxists?” Second, what has led
them to worship at the shrine of a
minor 19th century social and eco-
nomic thinker?

When I was young in the late
1930's and first entered rhetorical
combat with the Marxists, one thing
could surely be said: these characters
had read Marx and read him closely.
Nevertheless, they disagreed about
most things. There was a basic con-
sensus about one item however: Marx
(as Engels put it in 1833 while

Curbing speech to fight racism

speaking at Marx’s grave) was the
Charles Darwin of social science, the
man who had discovered the funda-
mental laws of historical change.

These laws doomed the capitalist
to destruction as inexorably as
Darwin’s “survival of the fittest”
prescription doomed the dinosaurs.
This vision was not based on person-
al animosity — after all, Marx and
Engels had nothing but praise for the
capitalist mission in the Manifesto -
— but rather on a belief that history
was a script in five acts which hu-
man decisions could in no way alter
or rewrite.

The contemporary Marxists who
are ensconced in the faculties of all
the major universities in the country
are anything but clinicians. Indeed my
experience suggests that their knowl-
edge of Marx’s career and writings is
virtually nonexistent. For example,
they seem to think that Marx was a
great force in his time for social
justice, when in fact he was practical-
ly unknown except among German
radicals. John Stuart Mill, the great

political economist who was a con-
temporary, _does not once refer to
Marx in his enormous body of writ-
ings, including all his letters.

What then do today’s radicals
mean when they call themselves
Marxists. Most of all, they mean to
express their dissatisfaction with the
status quo, finding any status quo
heartless. The fact that this has little
or nothing to do with what Marx
actually believed does not seem to
pose a problem. That Marx admired
what has come to be lmown as “cul-
tural genocide” and looked forward
to Westemizing the natives has been
all but forgotten. Marxism has be-
come the repository of all ill-feeling
about contemporary society.

This leads to my second question:
if Marxists today do not study or
even understand the life or teachings
of the god, why is it that they call
themselves Marxists? Here I think the
answer is quite simple. American
radicals in the academy are for vari-
ous reasons anti-American and they
think, quite naively, that the specter

of Marxism haunts the “American
Establishment.” Over the years, theréi
has been a lot of fiery “anti-Marx-
ist” rhetoric that could provide evi-
dence for this view. But today, thq
average American business is more_
terrified by the Internal Revenue‘
Service than he is by the threat of‘
workers’ revolution.

The “good news” is that mosh
American academicians are non—politi}
cal. Only a small minority are activ-
ists. The vast majority are inert, not;
because they are scared, but because
they find academic politics a waste of;
time. Thus, while administrators be-
gins their ritualistic preemptive capit—’
ulation to some noisy activist just as
soon as the first blank round is fired,‘
the bulk of American professors‘
unfortunately say: “To hell with it -

— let the dean deal with thosel ..

clowns. ’ ’

By John Zipperer

Students returning to school this past fall at the
University of Wisconsin received a disturbing les-
son from their teachers. In response to numerous
incidents of racial misconduct in recent years, the
university administration instituted a ban on speech
that “created a hostile environment” for other stu-
dents. The administration claimed that racism had
grown to such proportions that it demanded
immediate and drastic action — even if this in-
volved the extraordinary step of restricting speech.
Interestingly, in the first semester in which the
university was armed with such a strong weapon
against racism, UW officials failed to use it.
Unfortunately for the school, however, the mere
presence of a rule banning racially offensive

speech creates “a hostile environment” for the
teachers and students within it, and ultimately
makes the problem of racism worse.

Attempting to deal with the problem of racism
on our college campuses by restricting free sp-
eech is destined to fail: most of what we value
will be destroyed in the process, while racism will
inevitably survive. And yet at the Universities of
Pennsylvania, Berkeley, and Michigan, adminis-
trators have adopted bans on racial speech simi-
lar to the one in place at Wisconsin —— and many
other colleges and universities are considering
adopting such rules soon.

Almost uniformly these rules prohibit students
from making derogatory comments about another
student's race. While rules also ban insults based
on a person’s age, sex, religion, sexual orien-
tation, handicap, and veteran status, the rules’
main focus is racism. Penalties for violation in-
clude a reprimand, “sensitivity reeducation," and

‘From the W&L News Ofﬁce

‘ Scientists from the United States
,,and the Soviet Union will gather on
the campus of Washington and Lee
Yin June to discuss environmental
‘conservation for the 1990s.

The conference, sponsored by the
OU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will
,be held June 17-22.

' “Since the signing of the U.S. -
4USSR Agreement on Cooperation in
Environmental Protection in 1972, the
Department of the Interior has es-
ttablished and maintained active pro-
fessional relationships with its count-
lerpart ministries in the Soviet
-.,Union,” said Steven G. Kohl, USSR
program coordinator for the U.S. Fish
“and Wildlife service.
. “As the 1990s begin, the two

sides have decided to take stock of
ongoing activities and deﬁne their
joint conservation priorities for the
coming decade.

“The goal of this conference is
to bring together young scientists
from each country who are likely to
play a leading role in the forrnula-
tion and implementation of conser-
vation policy in the 21st century.”

Approximately 40 scientists from
each country are expected to par-
ticipate in the week-long conference.
It is expected that William Riley,
head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and other U.S. and Soviet
ofﬁcials will participate.

The participants will arrive in
Lexington on Saturday, June 16. A
banquet and keynote speaker will
highlight Sunday everiing’s activities.

The working sessions of the con-

ference will begin on Monday and
continue through Friday. Each day
will include plenary sessions and
general discussions, followed by
evening activities, such as lectures,
slide shows, and panel discussions.

The conference will conclude on
Friday with a final plenary session
on recommendations by the confer-
ence participants and a news confer-
ence.

“The agreement in 1972 between
the two countries led to the creation
of joint conservation projects in the
areas of rare and endangered species
of fauna and ﬂora, migratory birds,
marine mammals and fish husbandry
that have contributed signiﬁcantly to
the protection and management of
shared wildlife resources,” Kohl said.

“It is our hope that the evolving
process of perestroika in the Soviet

Union, combined with this con-
ference, will bring unprecedented
opportunities for American and So-
viet scientists to travel and work
together in some of the most remote
regions of both countries,” he said.

Among the topics scheduled to be
discussed at the conference are con-
servation research and management in
the U.S. and the USSR in 1990;
balancing resource development with
conservation needs; and conservation
planning for the twenty—ﬁrst century.

The ﬁnal plenary session will be
devoted to recommendation for fu-
ture cooperation in conservation re-
search and management.

Conference participants will be
housed in Gaines Hall. The plenary
sessions and other events will take
place at various locations across the
campus.

environment that limits the material
a professor may use in teaching, we
thus face the danger of producing a
generation of students who are so
poorly educated about history that
they threaten to repeat its worst

in its most fertile soil, the racial
speech rules spreading across Amer-
ican campuses will prove worse
than ineffectual; they will prove
counterproductive.

Using universities to restrict free
speech is a sad reflection of our
times. Universities act as the care-
takers of our society, transmitting
and, we hope, improving our values
from generation to generation. IN
attempting to deal with racism by
expelling students who say things
construed to be racist, the current
generation of academic leaders are
forsaking one of the most important
roles of the university. By their
punishment, they force those who

may be racists to clam up, and thu-
take them out of the discussions in
which their racist beliefs might be
challenged and changed by other
students.

Curbing racist speech on our

college campuses does not solve the
problem of racism, it only hides it.
History, while it is still allowed to
be taught, should teach us that
burying our heads in the sand
proves ineffective in making prob-
lems disappear.

Waiter uses Heimlich,
saves choking student

By Brian Root
Editor

Washington and Lee junior
Courtney Payne was saved from
choking to death by a student em-
ployee in the General Headquarters
Monday night.

“I was just sitting there," Payne
said. “Suddenly, a piece of food got
stuck in my throat. I couldn't breathe
or talk.

“It was weird. It was like I saw
everything in slow motion," Payne
said. “Then, I saw Jeff come sprint-
ing around the bar to help me.”

Jeff Rogers, a junior and a waiter
at GHQ, applied the Heimlich
Maneuver to Payne, and dislodged the
food from her throat.

“I think Jeff deserves a lot of
recognition,” said Payne.

Payne said she was surprised that
Rogers was the only GHQ employee
who knew the Heimlich Maneuver.

“In New Jersey and some other

states I know it’s a state law that
restaurant staff have to know it," she
said. “At least, anyone who manages
a place show know what to do.”

According to W&L Food Service
Manager Gerald Darrell, Virginia
does not require that all restaurant
personnel have such training.

“Even though it’s not mandatory,
we have training sessions on the
Heimlich Maneuver for all Evans
Dining Hall staff,” he said. “It's our
mistake that we’ve never done it for
our employees in the Pit. We're
going to make it mandatory there
from now on.”

Although the staff in the GHQ
and the snack bar have not been
trained, Darrell said, each place has
signs that show how to perform the
maneuver.

Darrell said Rogers had not been
trained in the Heimlich Maneuver by-
W&L and that “he just happened to
know what to do.”

“He’s my hero, if he's not any-
one else’s,” Payne said.

Comer trial set for July

By Genlenne Mongno
Staff Reporter

The trial of former Washington
and Lee student Charles “Blake"
Comer, who has been charged with
the March 1989 hit-and-run death of
W&L student Mary Ashley Scar-
borough, is set to begin on July 25.

Comer, 22, faces charges of hit-
and-run and involuntary manslaughter.
If convicted on both counts he could
face up to 15 years in prison.

Police arrested Comer in Novem-
ber after receiving a tip from an
unidentified W&L graduate. The tip
led police to Comer's home in
Greenville, S.C. where they located
the car involved in the accident.

In his statement, Comer told po-
lice he was driving the car, his moth-
er’s 1986 Honda Accord, when it hit
Scarborough on March 16.

He said he was driving east on
Washington Street toward McDon-
ald’s when Scarborough “stumbled in

Atkins proposed that the amend-
ment say that while a fraternity is on
social probation, the members simply
lose their social privileges. This
would ban members from attending
other fraternity parties, sorority func-
tions or private parties.

“I think you need to decide
whether or not you’re willing to
punish yourselves,” said Atkins.

Some fraternity representatives at
the meeting spoke out saying that a
social probation that restricts parties
at the house is tough as it is.

Brooks Pettus, president of Phi
Kapp, said “Sure, you can party at
other peoples house, but that's not as
much fun. You still like to party at
your own house."

Atkins said that by requesting the
SAC to approve the amendment, the
IFC was asking them to decide
“whether it’s possible to flog some-
one to death with a powder puff in
four years.”

The arnezidment as passed by the
IFC must be approved by the SAC
and then reaffirmed by a second vote
of the IFC.

Lewis Tuesday night reiterated his
call last week for fraternities to con-
trol any rowdy alurnni this weekend.

“We [Kapppa Sigma] are even
thinking of hiring security to monitor
our house," he said.

Atkins agreed with Lewis, saying,
“You shouldn’t have to stand there
as an 18 or 20 year old, and tell

someone 27 or even 50 years-old to
grow up. It's absurd for you to have
to tell people who should know bet-
ter.”

Lewis praised the fraternities for
their conduct this past weekend.

“You all did great with shutting
down your parties and not getting any
noise violations,” he said.

After the regular meeting, rep-
resentatives from the five red square
houses and Sigma Alpha Epsilon met
with Lewis and Atkins to discuss
plans for where to hold their rush
activities.

For Open Houses and Rush Dates,
the six houses agreed to a lottery
system for assigning places. Only
four places have been reserved by the
IFC so far - Fairfax Lounge, the
Alumni House, the GHQ garneroom,
and room 109 of the university cen-
ter. The representative from Phi
Kapp said that his house would be
willing to use the “Munster house”
on Nelson street if they needed to.

The representatives agreed that
each house should be assigned one of
these areas for all of it’s open houses
and rush dates. They felt that while
rotating room assignments would be
more fair since some areas were nicer
than others, it would be better to be
consistent so that freshmen could
more easily distinguish between the
fratemities.‘

reserved the Dell for all of rush.

Phi Delt will be allowed to keep
the reservation at Zollman’s in ex-
change for its willingness to bow out
of the lottery and use its country
house, “Bear Farm”, for one of the
other party nights.

Phi Kapp will be allowed to keep
its reservation for the Dell for only
one of the nights; the other reserva-
tions will be thrown onto the lottery.

would be willing to have some of

Grads to join

staff in

From Staff Reports

Three graduates from the class of
1990 will be turning the tables and
joining Washington and Lee's ad-
ministration next year.

Shawn Copeland and Nancy Hick-
am will work as admissions coun-
selors and Joel Smith will be an
alumni staff associate starting July 2.

“I see this job as an attractive
and rare opportunity for me to play a
role in a very important aspect of the
life of the university," Copeland said.

“I’m really looking forward to
being able to work with different
kinds of people every day,” Hickam
said. “I think I’ll like the job."

Each job is only a one-year com-
mitment, but Copeland and Hickam
will have the option of applying for
another year or two.

“I'm not sure exactly what I want
to do, and I thought this would be a
good experience,” Smith said. “I
have some interest in public relations
and this seemed like a good stepping
stone. It’s a good job without the
long-terrn commitment.”

Both Copeland and Smith said
they have no aspirations to move up
in the administration but are open to
possibilities. Hickam said she hopes
to return to W&L after having earned
a doctorate degree.

“At this point, I plan to attend

July

law school after this job,” Copeland
said. “But who knows? A lot can
happen in one or two years.”

While all three said they are
enthused about staying in Lexington
for a fifth year, they also said they
are a little concerned about the social
situation.

“My position as a recent graduate
and employee of the university puts
me in a peculiar social situation,”
Copeland said. “While I’m still
friends with a lot of students, I won’t
be living the typical student life. At
the same time, I won’t be a typical
member of the faculty and staff so-
cial circles.”

“I think it’s going to be really
different next year, because I’m going
to be working here, and as an ad-
ministrator I won’t be able to do the
kinds of things I want to do,” Hick-
am said.

“I guess the only foreseeable
drawback with this job would be
getting bored with Lexington, but I
don't see that happening,” Smith
said. “I enjoy the outdoors and this
is a great place for fishing and
hiking.”

Copeland said, “I’m excited about
spending another year or two in
Lexington. There are a lot of oppor-
tunities that as students we either
pass up or ignore that I'm looking
forward to taking advantage of as a
Lexingtonian. ’ ’

sororities during rush that they did
not wish to be extended them.

Besenfelder said “When DG left,
it almost devastated us.” She also
said the interest group “had to spend
a lot of time getting them to come
back.”

Besenfelder said that right now
the interest group is making plans for
the future. In particular the interest
group looks forward to participation
in DG’s philanthropy, the Delta Gam-
ma Foundation for the Sight Conser-
vation and Aid to the Blind.

She encourages any females who
are interested to meet the interest
group, which meets in The Arlington
Women’s Center on Tuesdays at
7:30.

Beatty said that DG representa-
tives will form a colonization team to
conduct the fall rush and that the
representatives may include alumnae,
national officers, and active members
at one of the seven DG chapters in
Virginia.

Beatty said that although no plans
or goals for the colonization had been
established thus far, she knows there
is support at W&L for DG. Two of
DG’s main concerns are attracting a
competitive number of women and
making its presence at W&L a posi-
tive experience for its new members,
she said.

Beatty cited that concern as a
reason for delaying its colonization
until fall. “The numbers just were

not there,” she said of their winter
attempt. She cited one of their big-
gest problems at the time as an over-
estimation of the females who would
be willing to hold out for a new
group by Panhellenic. She was quick
to add that the circumstances were
out of their control.

Beatty said DG waited until now
to accept W&L’s invitation to colo-
nize because it had to be sure that
there were enough women interested
and that it would be in the best inter-
est of those women.

“Once they pledge, if the chap-
ter doesn’t make it, they’re out in the
cold. There’s nothing worse than to
make a big splash and it doesn't
work,” she said.

Triathlon challenges athletes 1

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

Thirty-nine entries ran, swam and
biked for charity in the second annual
Kappa Alpha Theta Triathlon, held
Sunday, April 29.

Beginning at 9 a.m., the event
included a run of 3.1 miles, 13 miles
of bicycling, and finally 36 laps in
the gymnasium pool.

The competition included both
individual and team entries.

Randall K. Ellis, '92, won the
men's individual competition with a
time of 1:20:06, and Laura Dodge
’91 led the women with 1:30:56.

“I'm very happy to have won,”
said Ellis.

This year’s triathlon attracted a
more diverse group of athletes, said
the event’s coordinator, senior Heath-
er Logan.

Besides male and female entries
from W&L, there were also several
competitors from VMI and the W&L
Law School.

The winners of the team relay
competition was composed of law
students Josh Van Hulst, Ken
Woodrow, and Chris McCool, ﬁnish-
ing with a combined time of 1:06:-

The triathlon was originated seven
years ago as an exercise for the
ROTC department. Two years ago,
the event was run by Executive Com-
mittee members Tim Phalen and Bill
Gottwalls.

Finally, , Kappa Alpha Theta
adopted the" triathlon as its pledge
project last year.

According to Logan, the triathlon
is a key step in forging the sorority
as a positive and important force on
campus.

project, Court Appointed Special

According to Logan, CASA’s goal
is to aid abused children in the court
system.

Besides Logan, 22 other members
of Kappa Alpha Theta participated in
the event. They worked throughout
the day setting the course up and
seeing that everything went smoothly.
Thetas served in various posts as
safety guards and trail workers.

“I was really honored that Theta
put enough conﬁdence in me to let
me coordinate it,” Logan said. “The
comment that I got from everyone
was that they had a lot of fun, and
that is what it is all about. It is a
very admirable accomplishment.”

Logan said the triathlon will be
held again next spring under the
coordination of junior Susan Reil.

Two weekends ago there was an
event that made its first appearance in
Lexington. As the morning of this
event approached, the sky clouded
and let forth a pounding rain. Yet
this would not stop the participants.
The event could have used more
publicity. Yet this, too, would no.
prevent the sizeable tumout. The
event was a walk-a-tlion called
“Making Strides."
walked for the Rockbridge Cancer

 V Unit of the American Cancer Society
and showed their support for all of

those who have been touched in some
way by cancer.

Cancer. It’s just a word. But
when cancer is mentioned, it arouses
feelings of hope, despair, pain, and

.death. Many have felt the impacts
of this disease. But it's just a word.
A word to be fought, and conquered.

When I spoke to senior Del Clark
about his struggle with cancer, I was
overcome by the sense of tranquility
that he seems to generate. Del is not
a victim of cancer, he is a survivor.

One of his close friends, who has
a similar impression of Del remarked:
“Del is not struggling with cancer,
he has conquered it!"Too often we
associate cancer with death. We are
scared of the word, and the thoughts

it evokes. But there is another side
to cancer stories. There are those
who survive.

Del learned he had cancer in 1988
during his sophomore year. While
playing basketball, a ball hit him in
the head and immediately paralyzed
part of his body. After tests and

‘ examinations, Del’s doctor told him
he had a brain tumor, he had cancer.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

“When I heard my doctor say

I’ cancer, I became really scared," said

Del. “I was struck by the power of
that word. It is not easy to have to

face up to the possibility of your own

death."

Del remembered his first day with
cancer. He cried. He cried all day.
He cried all night. Then, Del over-

looked the word and began his battle.

Del underwent a five hour opera-
tion to remove the tumor on his
brain. This was followed by weeks
of radiation treatment. Through it
all, Del did not give up. He couldn't

can too. You can't give up. You
give up.

“So much sympathy," Del said,
recalling the reactions of others to-
ward his illness. “I hated it. It was
overwhelming. I wanted people to
lcnow that I was all right and needed
their company not their sympathy. I
was going to be O.K."

One source of power for Del
came from his faith in God. Del
said it would have been easy for him
to doubt God in light of his cancer,
but he did not. He realized that if he
wanted to be a survivor, he needed
help.

“I was never alone. That was the
greatest thing. I was never alone,"
he said. “Even when my friends and
family had left, I still had the doctor
upstairs.”

Del graduates this year. His can-
cer can only be found now in memo-
ries.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

George Cunningham is another
amazing man who fought the battle
against cancer and won. He has lived
in Lexington for a very long time.
He is a retired Lexington postal
worker, who loves to run. Maybe
you've seen him running in the mor-
nings.

When I called his house, George's
wife answered the phone.

“I’m sorry,” she said. “He’s out
running and I don't expect him back
for another hour."

I laughed in disbelief and called
back an hour later.

Even though George lost his lar-
ynx to cancer, he jogs almost every
day. He is a man who runs mara-
thons.

“I had an operation in ‘78,” he
recalled. “It was tough because I
had to learn how to speak again.”

When George learned he had
cancer, he quit smoking and took up
jogging. He said his passion for
jogging kept him going.

“I was determined to jog again,"
he said. “I wanted to run in the
Boston Marathon. I had to do it."

George not only ran in the Boston
Marathon, he ran it the same year of
his operation. He runs about 45 to
50 miles a week.

“I'm not special,” said George.
“I just want people with cancer to
know that if I can go through it, they

have to fight.”

Cancer is just a.word.. A. word I0

Coach “Buck" Leslie

be conquered.

Coach “Buck" Leslie looked
great. He has been coaching the
W&L golf team for some time now
and was diagnosed as having cancer
last January.

“I was playing racquet ball when
I just ran out of steam,” he said. “I
went in for a physical and ended up
staying longer than I expected. After
some tests, the doc came over to talk
with my wife and me. He said I had
the big C. I got so scared that I
broke out into a cold sweat.”

Since being diagnosed, Leslie has
spent almost two months in and out
of the hospital. He said he never got
down on himself and that many peo-
ple have offered him their support.

“You’ve got to keep on keeping
on,” he said. “You make your
peace with the good Lord and do
what you have to do."

Coach Leslie goes for cnacer
treatment once a month, but he is
still running around. If you ever
need someone to talk to, go find
Buck. He’s one of the gentlest peo-
ple I’ve ever met.

Cancer is just a word. A word to
be conquered.

On October 7, 1990, the Making
Strides walk-a-thon will return to
Lexington. I urge you to participate
because cancer patients need your
help. They need your help not to
die, but to survive. Cancer victims
are survivors. The examples live
among us.

Conquer the word, and we all can
win.

Alumni Weekend kicks off

By Joshua Manning
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee commu-
nity will welcome back over 700

' graduates this evening to kick off the

armual Alumni Weekend celebrations,
according to Alurrmi House staffer

~ Betsy Parkins.

Although 700 alumni are regis-
tered to attend the formal reunions
scheduled for the classes of ’40, '45,

I ’50, ’55, ’60, '65, '70, ’75, '80, and
f ’85, Parkins said that usually some
1 reunionists attend without
1 registered with the Alumni office. In
- addition, about 100 alumni from other
 years, especially '89, will probably
3 retum for the affair. Including the
j alumrii’s spouses, Parkins estimated
; that the number of guests is expected
; to surpass 1,000.

having

This number is up from 630 reg-

 istered reunionists last year and 477
I alumni who returned in 1985.

Special attention will be paid to

 the class of 1940, who will celebrate
2_their 50tli anniversary. Many mem-

bers of the class of '40 will be re-
turning, including distinguished W&L
benefactors John Warner and Sidney
Lewis. Warner donated the money

that the University used to build the
Warner Center, which was named
after him. Lewis donated the money
used for the construction of the Law
School, which bears his name.

According to Parkins, a plaque
honoring Lewis and his wife Frances
will be unveiled at a gathering at Lee
Chapel on Saturday morning. The
plaque will probably be placed in
Washington Hall.

Jim Farrar, Associate Alurrini
Director, said, “This reunion week-
end provides the University with a
marvelous opportunity to formally
welcome back its most ardent and
loyal supporters -- the greater alumni
family.”

Farrar believes that alums general-
ly return for two reasons. The first
is to see their old friends either in
their class or on the school's faculty.
The second is to see the campus and
get a feel of W&L today. He said
that besides looking for what has
changed, alumni are just as interested
in what has stayed the same.

The reunion program has been
developing over the past several
years. The program includes four
different panel discussions on various
subjects of current interest in addition
to a host of conferences, presenta-

  Aspects of Love:

1

I

'0

The Rlng-tum Phl, May 10, 1990

 

By Carli Flippen
Entertainment Columnist

Andrew Lloyd Webber, composer
of Phantom of the Opera, debuted his
new musical, Aspects of Love, in
London last April. Although the
musical does not open in New York
until later this spring, the recording
of the London cast is already avail-
able in the United States. Judging
from the recording, Aspects of Love
may be Webber’s best musical yet.

Webber’s career has seen almost
constant success since he began pro-
ducing Broadway musicals in the
early seventies, starting with Jesus
Christ Superstar. Other Webber suc-
cesses include Cats, Evita, and most
recently Phantom of the Opera. How-
ever, Aspects of Love could prove to

p be Webber’s most successful and

well-rounded musical. The plot is his
most complex and thought-provoking
since Evita. While the score is full of
lush harmonies and long, ﬂowing
melodies which mark many of
Webber’s best-known songs, it makes
better use of recitative and incorpo-
rates recurring theme better than
earlier musicals.

Aspects of Love differs frorri his
recent musicals in that, with the
exception of three minor production
mirnbers, it is an intimate, scaled-
down musical. Contrasting with Phan-
tom of the Opera and Cats, which
relied on grand production and dazzl-
ing special effects, Aspects of Love
is more modest in size, utilizing a
small chamber orchestra of sixteen
instruments and a chorus of twelve,
with most of the action surrounding
a small cast of six.

The differences between Webber's
last two hits, Cats and Phantom of
the Opera, and his newest musical
include the complexity of the various
plots. While Cats had virtually no
plot, and Phantom was a basic love
triangle, Aspects explores the complex
relationships which develop between
ﬁve of the six main characters.

The show opens with Alex, a 17-
year old boy, and Rose, an actress in
her 20s, falling in love and running
off to the villa of Alex's uncle,
George. However, when George
shows up unexpectedly, Rose falls in
love with him and runs away with
him.

Two years later, Alex is visiting
his uncle and finds Rose there. The
two argue and Alex accidentally
shoots Rose. At this point George
arrives in the apartment. Then, while

Rose is lying near death on the ﬂoor,
Alex, Rose throw Alex out and goes

off to ﬁnd George, who is in venice
with a former girlfriend. Then, while
Alex is abroad with the army, Rose
and George get married and a unique
relationship develops between Rose
and Gulietta, George's former lover.

Act Two begins with Alex retum-
ing from the army after 15 years and
finding Rose a famous actress. The
two meet, and Rose invites him to
visit her and George at their country
villa. Upon arriving, Alex greets
george and meets the couple’s 15-
year old daughter, Jenny. Alex ends
up spending the next two years living
with his uncle’s family. In those two
years, Alex and Jenny fall in love.
While nothing romantic happens
between them, their relationship
causes George great stress and leads
to a fatal heart attack.

At George’s funeral, Alex and
Gulietta meet and immediately be-
come romantically involved. Rose
begs him not to leave her in her
moment of need, refusing to be left
alone in the world. At the end of the
musical, Alex must make the monu-
mental decision of with which woman
to spend the rest of his life, three
women he has declared love to.

The complexity of the plot raises
many questions. Such as, can there
really be a romantic relationship
between Alex and Jenny? Although
she is a child and his cousin, she will
be an adult in only three years and
does love him. Does Rose truly love
Alex at the end of the musical or is

she simply afraid to be alone? There

is even a question concerning who is
the main character in the show. Even
though the ﬁnal choice is Alex's and
the ﬁnal section of the musical cen-
ters on him, why is Rose given the
final aria and why does Ann Crumb,
the actress playing her, receive top
billing?

The music in the show is classic
Webber. The songs make no attempt
to explore new harmonies, metric
conﬁgurations, or tonal relationships,
but that’s not the point. The music is
supposed to be beautiful and immedi-
ately accessible, not for academicians.
In this capacity, the music is a suc-
cess. The long, ﬂowing melodies of
such songs as “Love Changes Every-
thing,” “Anything But Lonely," and

“The First Man you Remember" are
memorable and sure hits. The harmo-
nies are lustful and romantic.

In the past Webber has been ac-

cused of robbing melodies from such
romantics as Puccini. However, I do
not recognize any steals in Aspects of
Love which would be too blatant to
themes recur to draw parallels be-
tween different situations and charac-
ters’ emotions are too numerous to
list. These recitative passages keep
the action ﬂowing.

Aspects of Love is Andrew Lloyd
Webber’s most thoroughly well-
crafted musical yet. Combining an
intelligent, compelling story with a
beautiful score, he has created another
success, most like his greatest yet.

Troubadour Theatre to take final bow

From News Releases

After resounding for ﬁfty-ﬁve
years with the applause of thousands

promises eclectic new sounds

short for sonority, the Italian word
for sound KLECT is an abbreviated
form for eclectic, she said.

“In contemporary music, there are
so many styles to choose from that
the composer can ﬁnd one to suit
him," said Brouwer. “It provides
for little creative constraint, anything
goes.”

The festival will feature talks by
eight accomplished composersof new
music — including Earle Brown,
Frederick Fox and Chinary Ung —
and some of their work.

Eight student composers from

across the country have also been

CRAFTS PLUS, INC.

chosen to have their music played at
SONOKLECT. Among them are two
W&L students — Andrew Wick-
liffe, '90, and Richard Hoover, '93.

The student composers, along with
three other W&L composition stu-
dents — James Elliot, ’93, Shana
Horrigan, '92 and Michael Skarda,
’93 — will meet with the composers
in residence for a series of master
classes.

“In these classes, the composers
in residence will listen to and com-
ment on the student compositions,"
Brouwer said. “This will be a valu-
able experience for the students. It's

important for composers to be lis-
tened to.”

Compositions during the festival
will be performed by some ac-
complished musicians, including violi-
nist Eliot Chapo, former concertrnas-
ter of the New York Philharmonic
and Dallas Symphony Orchestra.

The W&L New Music Ensemble,
who Brouwer said is a group of
outstanding perfomiers, will also
perform at the festival.

SONOKLECT performances will
take place Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights, beginning at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

The Ring-tum Phl, May 10, 1990

Senior attackman Chris Mastrogiovanni beats his defender toward the goal in Saturday's 18-7 win over VMI
on Wilson Field. Mastro scored two goals to run his season total to 38. Staff photo by Chris Leiphart.

’ By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

For one half of play Saturday on

’ Wilson Field, the Third Annual Lee-
* Jackson Lacrosse Classic resembled
I the Second Annual Classic.

But the first half between Virginia
Military Institute and Washington and
Lee was the only part of this year’s_

‘ contest that resembled last year's

game.

After jumping out to a 6-2 lead,
like they did last year, W&L then
allowed a late first half run by VMI
to cut the lead to 6-5 at intermission.
Last season VMI tied the game at 6-
6 at halftime.

Said senior defenseman Mike
Nunan, “We knew going into the

 

game that we were the better team if
we played four quarters. We didn’t
play a good second quarter, and that
scared us a little.”

Unlike last season's thriller that
W&L won 10-9 in overtime on a
goal from then-freshman Wiemi
Douoguih, the Generals took control
early in the third quarter and never
let up.

“We came out in the second half
and got some quick goals, and that
made us feel more comfortable,” said
Nunan.

After an unnecessary roughness
call on VMI’s Pat Poon with 13:01
left in the third quarter, W&L went
on a 9-1 run over the next 22 min-
utes to break the game open. Junior
attackman Mike Moseman lit the fuse
with a quick shot just nine seconds
into the penalty that found its mark.

464-2695

Sophomore Jeff Roberts beat his
man and goalie Matt On with 6:18
left for his third goal of the day, and
senior attaclcrnan Chris Mastro-
giovanni got his first goal with 4:58
left in the third quarter.

When junior midfielder and defen-
sive specialist Andy Guida scored his
first goal of the season with 2:34 left
in the period off a feed from fresh-
man Derek Hutton, VMI took time
out to stop the rally.

Said W&L head coach Jim Stag-
nitta, “Andy has been solid on de-
fense all season long, and we've
always said he can play with the ball
after he gets it into his stick. He and
[junior midfielder] Mike Pardo have
gotten better all year. They are the
unsung heroes. They aren't very
ﬂashy, but they're effective.”

After VMI scored first in the

fourth quarter, senior midfielder Jim
Jones turned up the heat in the Gen-
erals’ oven. Two straight goals in
under a minute rriade it 12-6, and
when Mastrogiovanrii and junior
midfielder Todd Garliss each scored
within a minute the score was 14-6.

When Jones scored his third goal
of the quarter with 4:56 left, the
contest was all but officially over.
W&L got three more goals from its
freshman class of Rhett Hancock,
John Hunter and Jay West to close
out the 18-7 win.

It was the first win by a home
team in the Lee-Jackson Classic and
also the first time that City Manager
Joe King was wrong in picking the
outcome. He picked VMI.

In the first half, W&L was spark-
ed by two goals from Roberts and
one each from Garliss, junior Clark
Wight, Douoguih and Nunan.

Said Nunan, a long-stick defen-
seman, “I wanted to shoot low, but
it went high. But it still counts as my
one and only career goal.”

“With all the hype around town
with the game, we just tried to take
it like any other game,” said Stag-
nitta. “We cut back on practice and
tried to keep our legs fresh. We just
did the things we had to do. Most of
our shots were lay-ups. We had some
penalties, but the defense did a good
job of keeping them in check all day
long."

On the afternoon, twelve different
players scored goals for the Generals,
led by Jones and Roberts with three
each. Garliss and Mastrogiovanni
scored twice. Moseman had a goal
and two assists. Junior Tom Costello
was strong in goal again, making 12
saves while stopping all six of VMI’s
extra-man chances.

“Balance has been the key for us
all year,” said Stagnitta. “We’ve
been getting five people in the scor-
ing column each game. Mastro isn't
scoring like he was earlier because
people are keying more on him,
which helps everyone else. They
don't slide off him, and other players
like Wighty, Jones, Wiemi and Rob-
erts are able to pick up the slack.”

After the win, their sixth in their
last seven games, the Generals, 9-4,
were ranked 11th in the ﬁnal Divi-
sion HI poll after two straight losing
seasons.

Generals embarass VMI in L-J Classic 2

tournament, the players and first year
coach alike are not disappointed.

“We knew we always had lots of
talent, especially on defense," said
Mastrogiovanrii. “At first it was
disappointing, not getting invited, but
now we are realizing that we had a
great season. We felt we had a shot
at the tournament and did everything
we could to get in, and when the
committee took over, we couldn't
control anything."

“We are just now starting to put
it all together,” said Stagnitta. “It
only makes me think, what if we had
had a fall season? Where would we
be now?

“This team has done everything

I've asked from day one. They’ve
worked hard and come to practice
every day, and they were not easy
practices. They put themselves in a
position to get into the playoffs.
People told me before the season that
we wouldn’t win two games -— but
we did. I’d be an idiot to be disap-
point "

“Getting into the tournament

 

 

would have been a great way to
finish the season,” said Nunan. “It 0
was no great disappointment. We still
had a great finish, beating Harnpden-
Sydney for the first time in two years f.
and whipping VMI." ‘,
Although the loss of the seniors
will leave some holes to fill, Stagnitta
is confident that those holes will be
filled. “Roberts, Wiemi, Garliss and 9
Clark Wight all played well at the
end of this year, and they are all
getting better each day.” \
Along with Moseman, the offense
that will return scored 73 goals and

handed out 59 assists. Costello will 1 1

return after making 153 saves in 12
games. The defense will be led by
junior David Farace and freshman lg
Kirk Olsen, who saw valuable playing
time in his first season.

Said Stagnitta, “We had a great ,
year. If we finish 9-4 any other year,
we make the playoffs. It just so I
happens that this year there were
other teams who had great seasons.

I'd be an idiot to be disappointed * j:

Senior Mike Nunan makes the final approach on the way to a goal in 4
Saturday's Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic. Nunan, a four-year starter on
defense, scored the lone goal of his career on the play. Staff photo by \

The Fling-tum Phl, May 10, 1990

W&L golf exemplified in coach

By John Laney
Associate Sports Editor

After winning the Old Dominion

‘M Athletic Conference title last week,

the Washington and Lee golf team
has continued to practice every day,

‘ assuming it will compete in the Div-
p ision III national championships.

Although the team must wait until
May 14 to learn if it received a bid
to the championships, which will be
held at Jekyll Island, Ga., May 22-
25, the Generals have good reason to
expect an invitation.

Four teams will be invited from
the South Region. Host Emory and
Methodist appear to have two spots.
Christopher Newport, Lynchburg,
Roanoke and W&L are candidates for
the other two. Winning the ODAC
should go a long way in helping the
Generals.

“I can’t see us not going,” said
sophomore Clay Thomas, the ODAC
Golfer—of-the-Year.

“I feel very strongly We’ll get a
chance to go,” said co-head coach
Mike Piatt. “Only 20 teams are in-
vited nationwide, so just to go is an
honor. We’ll go down there and see

 what happens.

“Our strength this season was our

1 depth. That was the key. In college
._~‘ golf, you count the four top finishers
 in each match. We counted a dif-
j‘; ferent four each match,” Piatt con-
’* tiriued. “We’re fortunate to have so
. many good golfers here. Most teams
_ cnlv have one or two.”

This season’s success is not a
new experience for W&L golf. In 15
years as head coach, E.G. “Buck”
Leslie has lead his teams to an as-

_—} toriishing 139-24-2 record. He has
' coached three teams into the national

championships, two All-Americans,

 six individual ODAC medalists, in-
 cluding this year’s champion, soph-

omore Jay McKnight, and 28 all-
ODAC golfers (Thomas and Mc-
Knight were all-ODAC this season).
Leslie has also been the conference
Coach-of-the-Year in 1977, 1978,
1983 and 1988.

Thomas is the fourth conference
Player-of-the-Year in Leslie"s tenure.

“I'm very pleased with my sea-
son,” Thomas said. “I played real
solid golf all year. I had a lot of
good days.”

Yet, this season has been a new
experience for the Generals. Al-
though the W&L coach was ODAC

,Coach-of-the-Year, his name was not

Leslie.
In late December, Leslie was

 diagnosed as having leukerriia and

was in and out the hospital in Jan-
uary, February and March.
“The type I have is not the

"' worst — it isn't the best, but it’s not

Hinely.

the worst,” Leslie said.

Leslie's six—montli cycle of treat-
ment ends in June and then he goes
for routine checkups.

“Hopefully my condition will be
stabilized in a couple of months,”
Leslie said. “With the doctors and
the Good Lord willing, I'll be back
to my normal workload in the fall.”

When Athletic Director Mike
Walsh approached Leslie for someone
to work with the team, Leslie recom-
mended Piatt, who just finished his
first year as an assistant coach for

W&L’s basketball team. Piatt has
played golf since the age of 12 and
golfed with Leslie last summer, but
he had never coached the game.

“I didn't know what to expect. I
didn’t knowiif‘ it would be for a
week, a month or the whole season,"
Piatt said. “I had to do the budget-
ing and everything, but it’s been a
great experience."

Leslie would talk with Piatt every
day about how the team was playing
and planning the schedule. Leslie also
called the players to congratulate

them when they did well, and when
he could, he would go to matches
and watch the players warm up.

“I was basically an extension of
Buck,” Piatt said. “It’s Buck’s team.
He built the ship and I just tried to
keep it going in the right direction.
I’m just glad I was able to have
helped him out.”

Piatt gave his Coach-of-the-Year
plaque to Leslie, but Leslie returned
it to him. Now there are plans to
have another plaque made for Leslie.

“He [Piatt] did an excellent job. I
wish I had Mike back with me for
next year,” Leslie said, referring to
Piatt's plans to seek other oppor-
tunities in coaching.

“We all got along real well with
Coach Piatt,” Thomas said. “He’s
only a couple of years older than
us.”

“The transition from Leslie to him
wasn't a problem,” said senior co--
captain Ted Fox. “We all felt com-
fortable around Piatt. Everything
worked out for the best.” 1

Fox, who has known Leslie for
four years, described his coach as as
“a1l—around good guy,” while Thom-
as said Leslie was a great inﬂuence
and a great person.

Perhaps Piatt said it best.

“Buck is W&L golf. They don't
come any better than him. He's the
epitome of first class,” he said.

“He's kind of a legend around Rock-
bridge County.”

A native of Rockbridge County,
Leslie was an all-star quarterback at
Lexington High School in the early
1940s, before joining the navy in
World War II. Leslie received six
battle stars during his service as a
gun captain in the Paciﬁc Ocean.

Leslie was graduated from W&L
in 1949 with a degree in politics. As
as undergraduate he was an outstand-
ing pitcher and outfielder for the
baseball team. The team’s annual
most valuable pitcher award is now
named for Leslie.

Leslie became the golf coach in
1975 after the death of Cy Twombly,
who had directed the team since its
start at W&L in 1927. Leslie had
been an assistant to Twombly for 12
seasons.

Leslie, who plays a lot of golf in
the summer and still shoots in the
70s, said the highlights of coaching
golf at W&L have been the team’s
NCAA appearances and the ODAC
charnpionships. —

“But the nicest thing is the young
men that we have to work with,” he
said.

“Actually, I’m an old baseball
player at heart,” Leslie added. “I
once had the chance to be the W&L
baseball coach, but I stuck with golf.
I don't know. You ﬁgure it out.”

begin on the campus of Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania.

Washington and Lee, which fin-
ished 7-7 on the season, was selected
as an alternate but will miss the post
season for the first time in five years.
Despite not going as a team, W&L
will be well represented nonetheless.

When the twelve bids went out
lasg.,Sunday, W&L was selected as an
alternate to go if one team could not
participate. On Monday, an eligibility
question was raised by Washington
College, one of the invited teams,
which would have affected W&L.

Head coach Gary Franke _ex-

plained that one "player from Wash-
ington College unknowingly played in
more matches than the NCAA allows
for one season.

Once this infraction was found,
WC officials immediately declared the
player ineligible and notified the
NCAA. The school appealed success-
fully to have the player's eligibility
reinstated.

Despite not going as a team,
W&L will be represented in both
singles and doubles by the defending
champion. In singles, senior John
Morris will look to become the first
player to win back to back NCAA
Division IH singles titles.

Morris has been ranked No. 1 all
season after winning the title last
season with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 win in
‘ ‘H’

the finals. This season, Morris is 18-
5 in singles play and was named Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Player-
of—the-Year for the second straight
year.

“John has adjusted to the pressure
of being No. 1 very well. He has
accepted the fact that every time he
goes out on the court, people are
shooting at him,” said Franke. “If
John plays the way he is capable of
playing, then he can defend his title.
If he plays one bad match, it could
all be over.”

“I know I’m capable of winning
it again. If I'm playing really well
and get some lucky breaks, then I
think I will do it again,” said Morris.
“I’m feeling ll lot of pressure, more
than I thought I would after I won it
last year, but I’m hoping the pressure
will helprne play better. But it’s still
a lot of pressure.”

In doubles, Morris, along with
junior Bill Meadows are ranked 10th
in the nation and will also be par-
ticipating in the individual touma-
ment. Morris teamed with Bobby
Matthews to win the doubles title last
year as well. Morris and Meadows
are currently 16-6 on the season.

“Bill and I have gotten more
comfortable with each other as the
year has gone on," said Morris.
“We’ve improved every match, and
I think we’ve got a definite shot at
winning it all."

Said Franke, “John is a dominant
doubles player, and Bill is a fighter.
If they both are playing as well as
they are able, they could go a long i
way."
