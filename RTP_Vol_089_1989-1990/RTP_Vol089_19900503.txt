The Executive Comrnitte-elect
voted informally Wednesday night
against opening deliberations on com-
mittee appointments to the public.

EC Vice President-elect Raymond
Welder, presiding while EC President-
elect Thompson Hatcher is abroad,
voted in favor of the motion to open
deliberations.

Hatcher and Welder ran for ofﬁce
last term on platforms of more open-
ness in EC affairs.

Welder explained Wednesday
night that EC members should be
held accountable for their decisions,
since they are elected representatives.

The other EC members-elect voted
as follows on the motion to open
deliberations: Dumas, Fialcowitz,
Perkins, and Spurgeon all voted in
favor. Cobb, Kelsey, Kennington,
MacFarland, Wight, and Sophomore
Class President-elect Richard Burke,
sitting in for Ogden, all voted against
the motion.

Welder decided Tuesday night to
close the interviews for appointments,
despite a statement Monday night that
he would open them.

“I think [a Ring-tum Phi report-
er] should be here,” he said Monday,
noting that it might be helpful for
future applicants to refer to the Phi
in preparation foyr their interviews.

However, after Tuesday's inter-
views, Welder said that some can-
didates would not have been able to
be as open as they were with the EC
in their interviews had a reporter or
observers been present.

“Nobody elected the people who
wanted to be part of these commit-
tees to be in the hot seat,” said
Welder Tuesday. However, he said he
believes EC members are account-
able to students, and so deliberations
should be open.

Walter Scott, secretary of the
Constitutional Revisions Committee.
said the committee is now consider-
ing whether or not the EC should be
allowed to enter executive session for
proceedings other than honor-related

Atkins condemns
alcohol spending

By Jason Kelley
Senior Copy Editor

Saying, “It's time to grow up,
guys,” Associate Dean of Students
Leroy “Buddy” Atkins Tuesday
night decried the reported use of
fraternity house funds to purchase
alcohol.

“If you don't suck it up and tell
people that it’s BYOB, you’re going
to end up with paid security at the
door, and no one who is not of
drinking age will be admitted into the
house,” Atkins said at an Interfrater-
nity Council meeting.

Atkins said fraternities that buy
alcohol with house funds are putting

ordinance in any way.

suits.

“The minute you do that, you're
going naked — without any ir1sur-
ance whatsoever. If I see kegs at
your houses, I’ll call your national.
And if the national fraternity yanks
your charter, the university will end
it’s recognition of your house, and
then it’s bye-bye.”

IFC President Goodloe Lewis said
fraternities are in a bad position right
now because they want to continue
holding fall rush and need to behave
well to do so.

“The administration is watching
your every move, and if you screw
up, it may even affect your Renais-
sance standing,” said Lewis, referring

EC Vice-President—elect

The EC-elect received more than

positions.

No one applied for Financial

’ “The EC has the prerogative,”
said Welder, to keep a position open

Welder also said that Hatcher
instructed that the EC-elect not ap-
point someone to a position for
which they did not apply.

In Monday night's regular EC
meeting, White Book Revisions Com-
mittee Chairman Claude Worrell told
the EC that the committee has split
into three groups to study the philo-
sophy, closed hearing, and open hear-
ing sections of the White Book.

Worrell said that the committee

to ﬁnish it’s work by December.

CRC revisions tabled

By James Lake
Staff Reporter

Proposed revisions to the policies
of the Conﬁdential Review Commit-
tee won’t be adopted until next fall
at the earliest, Washington and Lee
President John Wilson said Tuesday.

The suggested changes, which
would alter W&L's definitions of
harassment and modify the process of
appealing convictions, were approved
by the CRC in December and have
been in Wilson's hands since January.

But the president, who must ap-
prove the changes for them to take
effect, has yet to act on them and
says further study is needed, includ-
ing discussion of how the CRC’s
guidelines affect free speech rights.

“I don't want to go by a CRC
review without touching on [that]
larger question,” he said.

Wilson called the proposed

,k changes “technical" and said the
broader issues he wants considered
have not been a part of the recent
study of CRC policies.

Wilson said he wants under-
graduate and law faculty to discuss
how the CRC’s guidelines can be
written so that they forbid harass-
ment without discouraging other kinds
of speech. But he said he doesn't
think any formal discussion of that
question will take place until the fall.

The CRC, a committee of three
students and four faculty members
that investigates claims of sexual,
racial, ethnic or religious harassment
of students, met on Nov. 28 with

Dean of Students Lewis John. That
meeting led to the proposals that are
now before the president.

As The Ring-tum Phi reported on
Nov. 30, the proposed changes would
turn the focus of the CRC’s guide-
lines away from claims of faculty and
staff harassment of students and more
toward keeping students from harass-
ing each other.

For example, existing rules say
racial and ethnic harassment “include,
but are not restricted to, actions that
use ethnic, racial and religious char-
acteristics as a basis for discrimina-
tion against an individual in any
course, program or activity.”

But the proposed guidelines say
“ethnic, religious, racial and sexual

D Please see CRC page 3

The Phi deeply regrets the confusion.

Correction

An ticle in last week’s Ring-tum Phi incorrectly
stated the status of plans for sorority houses at Wash-
ington and Lee.

According to Panhellenic Housing Chairman Laurel
Ann Heiskell, site plans have been drawn up describ-
ing possible locations for sorority houses, but blue
prints do not yet exist. W&L will not begin serious
consideration of building the houses before 1992, and
construction will not begin for at least five years.

“There are no definite plans, and there will not be
any defninite plans for many years,” Heiskell said.

The Phi regrets the errors.

“The Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Clas-
sic is the brainchild of Lexington
City Manager Joe King,” said Rock-
bridge Area Recreation Association
spokesman Doug Chase. “It involves
a cooperative effort from the Lexing-
ton Community, Washington and Lee
University and Virginia Military
Institute and the Lexington Downtown
Development Association. ’ ’

The idea behind the classic is to
strengthen ties between the Lexington
community and the two colleges. For
the past two weeks, both W&L and
VMI and the city of Lexington have
strived to make an effort to become
closer together.

One beneﬁt of the classic, says
Chase, is teaching area youth about
lacrosse. Coaches and players from
both W&L and VMI along with Chad

had dinner together. At the dinner,
the players from both teams were
seated together in a effort to strength-
en the relationships between the
teams. On Wednesday, both institu-
tions and the city had a cocktail party
held in the Morris House.

“The evening functions give the
players an opportunity to know each
other in a non-lacrosse setting,” said
Chase.

The game is about more than just
lacrosse. “It is an honest effort by
the City of Lexington to reach out,”
said Chase.

Said Bartlett, “I'm thankful to
everyone involved in the game -— the
schools, RARO, the city, everyone
who has put forth the effort they've
all put forth to make this thing possi-
ble. It's agreat way to end a sea-
son, for everyone.”

 OPINION

Lacrosse is back
in the limelight

Saturday, the W&L men’s lacrosse team will end
one if its most surprising and enjoyable regular seasons
in recent memory when it plays VMI in the annual
Lee-Jackson Classic at Wilson Field. Everyone should
go.
In the past, W&L lacrosse has been measured by its
success in the postseason tournament. Although the
team has only an outside chance to make the eight-
team field this year, that should in no way dampen
what has been a remarkable turnaround.

As most of us are depressingly aware, W&L lacrosse
had fallen on hard times. The team's record for the
previous two seasons was 6-20. Ouch.

Since the arrival of new head coach Jim Stagnitta,
however, that has changed. This year, the team is 8-4
with one game remaining, and has a chance to return to
the NCAA tournament. In one season, W&L can return
W&L to its rightful status, as one of the premier
Division III lacrosse programs in the country.

There are lots of reasons to go to the game this
weekend. First, W&L has to win this game to have any
shot at the tournament. Second, watching VMI get
humiliated is always a good way to start a weekend.
Third, Coach Stagnitta and his players have earned our
respect and support this season, regardless of what
happens this weekend or in the tournament. The best
way we can show that is to be there Saturday.

Some ‘new ideas’
on college life

“Alcohol, drug abuse, crime and bigotry are
breaking down the social and intellectual fabric at many
college campuses.” So says The Associated Press in
summarizing a recent study by the Carnegie Foundation
and. the American Council on Education. The report
claims incidences of crime, sexual harrasnient and
alcohol abuse have increased steadily in the past five
years, and that college life has suffered accordingly.

According to the AP, two-thirds of the 382 college
presidents surveyed for the report said alcohol abuse is
at least a “moderate” problem on their campuses.
Some 43, percent, said crime had increased on their
caInpIi‘§e$ in .re9entI  And .slisbtly. :n10m:;than half
said, the’ [quality of campus life is ‘ of greater concern
than it was a few years ago.

What is the answer to all of this? Apparently, not
more rules and more deans. The college presidents said
they don't want to reinstate strict rules of behavior in
response to these apparent problems. “The goal is not
to have a list of unenforceable commandments. Rather
it is to asstue that all parts of college life are governed
by high standards,” the study says. “An educated
person, while always searching, is always guided by
civility and integrity.”

To us, that sounds an awful like what Gen. Robert
E. Lee said a long time ago. Wasn't it something about
expecting students to behave like gentlemen?

Maybe these guys are onto something.

North speech-t--recalls Gordon Liddyf

MY VIEW
By Michael Leapman

EDITOR'S NOTE: Last week, we
received a copy of the following col-
umn from Prof. Robert Johnson. In a
note accompanying the column, John-
son wrote, "The recent visit to the
campus by Oliver North brought to
mind an earlier appearance — nearly
ten years ago — by another convicted
felon, namely G. Gordon Liddy. of
Watergate infamy. I thought you might
be interested in how The Times of
London described his stay on our
campus.

The most sought-after lecturer on
American campuses talks ﬂuently of
death and violence, yet dresses with
studied sobriety. His grey pin-striped
suit tones in with his grey tie'with
white polka dots, over a white shirt
with button-down collar.

It all blends nicely with his irn—
maculate, bushy, grey-flocked hair
and moustache. In manner and ap-
pearance he is disconcertingly like
Mr. Enoch Powell, though better

in great, white and black. 0. Gordon
Liddy explains tlnt this is an honor-
ary decoration front the New York
police department, normally given to
policemen who have performed acts
of exceptional courage but awarded to
him because the police like him.

This is the first of many ironies
about Liddy; for his fame rests on
his criminal record. He was convicted
of complicity in the 1972 Watergate
break-ins and served four and a half
years in prison

Four nights a week, on average,
he visits a university and talks for
two hours about the Watergate affair
and his broad philosophy. He charges
$3,600 for each appearance and draws
capacity audiences.

With no trace of remorse, he tells
students that Watergate was a sirriple
act of political intelligeriee—gathering
of which there had been plenty be-
fore; that there were irregularities in
histrialandthejudgealteredthe
record; andthathisvictimizationis a
symbol of America's present deca-
dence. The students cheer him to the
echo.
Last week Liddy took hirriself and
his message to Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Virginia. To
be fair to American students in geri-
eral. I must point out that this is far
fromatypicalcampusltisoneof
the most conservative in America,
and proud of it.

At a reception for Liddy before
his speech, I asked some students
how that conservatism manifested

itself. “There's an underlying racism
here." said Doug Shipman, who is
studying politics. Of a student body
of 1,400, perhaps 40 are black.

It is also one of the only three
all-male universities remaining in the
United States — the exclusion of
women being a symptom of con-
servatism rather than a cause of it.

At the reception, Liddy sipped
sweet sherry from a brandy glass and
told of the treats he had in store for
us at the lecture. No holds, he as-
sured us, would be barred.

The students, most in blue blazers
and grey flannels, eagerly fed him
ammunition. Would he like to sum

“It’s a shame that people who
have done such despicable things
should be lauded. It's a case in point
that evil does pay off."

Meanwhile, the talk in Liddy's
group was turning to one of his fa-
vorite subjects, assassination. Asked
about the murder in London of a
Bulgarian emigre with the poisoned
tip of an umbrella, he said sagely:
“We have our ways and they have
theirs” before launching into a de-
tailed explanation of how the poison
worked.

“You don't assassinate people as
an act of revenge," he mused. ‘‘It’s
a preventive thing... if Jane Fonda

up the Carter administration in one
word? “Hopeless.”

Had the Watergate experience
changed him spiritually? “No. it con-
firmed my world view. The big fish
always eat up the little fish."

Most students loved it, but there
were dissenters. Though no women
are formally enrolled, six are on an
exchange program from a nearby
women's college. One of them, Laura

, O'Hear, said:

had done in the Second World War
what she did in the Vietnam War,
she would have been shot or electro-
cuted.

It has been documented how
Liddy, at one stage in his career,
recorrunended the assassination of
Jack Anderson, an investigative jour-
nalist, but was over-ruled by higher
authority. Another candidate for elirn-
ination whom he mentioned was
Philip Agee, who wrote an embar-

rassing book about the Central Intellii
gence Agency. ;
“Would you do it yourself?" he“
was asked “Like swatting a fly," he
answered. ‘
The hall was overﬂowing by thé
time Liddy came to speak. In this»
term’s two previous iectures, by
respectable but dull senators from the!
two major parties, there was an em-‘‘
barrassing expanse of empty space.
Not tonight. Students in T-shirtsi
and sweaters spread into the aisles.
and packed the gallery. Their ap-"
plause was as loud and insistent as,v.
machine-gun fire as Liddy strode on
to the stage. t
“Everything seems to be going
wrong for us at home and abroad,"
he began. “Americans tend to live at
life of illusion. Either they are unable
to comprehend reality or they tend to‘
turn away from it, hoping it will go’

I . away."

Liddy shrugged: “I played by met

The questioning reverted to kill-it

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion is scheduled to review the archi-
tectural plans for the renovation of
fraternity houses on Red Square at
their meeting next Thursday, accord-
ing to City Manager Joe King.

Before Washington and Lee can
apply for a building permit and start
the renovation of the fraternities, the
Planning Commission and the Archi-
tectural Board must approve the site
plans which were submitted by W&L
this Monday.

King said the plans must meet
two sets of standards before con-
struction will be allowed.

“First, the Planning Commission
primarily looks at aspects of the site
to see if they meet requirements for
things like adequate drainage, street
access and the relationship of the
building to utility lines,” King said.

King said the Planning Commis-

sion should approve the site plans
easily, since the houses are not being
built, only renovated

The plans will also be presented
to the Architectural Review Board,
which must review all building plans
involving the Lexington Historic
Dist.rict.

“In any historic area, you must
get permission to do anything to an
existing structure. That includes the
color of the paint, fixtures that are
added on the outside of a building,
like shutters, or repairs to the roo ,”
King said.

Once the Planning Commission
and the Architectural Review Board
consider the plans, they must be sub-
mitted to council for approval.

King said he thought the plans
would go before Council at their
meeting May 17. The university can
then apply for a building permit and
start commotion on Red Square.

According to King, Washington
and Lee has already recieved a build-
ing permit for the SAE house on

Threatening possible social proba-
tion, Lewis said, “I don't want to,
but I’m gonna dick you over if the
alumni mess up your house.”

Atkins agreed. “The alumni are
only in your house as your guests. If
they get out of hand, ask them to
leave. If they won't, you should call
the police."

Also, Atkins complained that he
felt an editorial in last week’s edition
of The Ring—tum Phi presented the
wrong image of W&L. Saying he is
opposed to having a spring term, he
said telling the world that students do
little studying during spring term
reﬂects badly on W&L.

Lewis and Atkins said that turnout
at last Saturday's IFC leadership con-
ference was disappointing. Represen-
tatives from six houses were on hand
to hear presentations on risk manage-
,ment, financial responsibility and
leadership.

“The turnout made the fraternity

system look bad. It made y’all look
bad, and it made Buddy and I look
ba ,” said Lewis.

Atkins said that the Alumni Frat-
ernity Council, which sponsored the
event, was trying to create a forum
in which fraternity leaders could talk
back and give input to the alumni.

“When no one shows up to an
event like this because it conﬂicts
with their social schedule, that looks
ba ,” said Atkins.

Atkins relayed a message from
university President John Wilson
about vandalism on Lee Avenue. A
resident had written the school last
year complaining that party-goers
were vandalizing cars parked on the
street.

In a letter received by Wilson last
week, the resident said that there had
been no incidents of vandalism in the
past seven months, and he thanked
the houses for keeping things under
control, according to Atkins.

him, according to Murray.

“All of the sudden, two or three
of them jumped him and dragged him
all the way across the street and
under the front end of a parked car,
where they were beating him,” said

‘ Murray, who had gone outside to

assist the officers in dispersing the
crowd.

According to witnesses, Officer
A.M. Miller began chasing one of the
attackers down Lee Avenue and a
group of about 20 people began to
chase him.

After the police began to gain
control of the situation, the crowd
moved down Washington Street to
the front of Lloyd’s.

Police requested Lloyd's to close
for the evening, and it reopened at 6
a.m.

A Lexington resident who wit-
nessed the event said that things grew
totally out of proportion.

“The law couldn’t seem to get
nothing accomplished. It should have
been only one fight. Some of the
people I lmew couldn't afford to be
in any more trouble with the law, so
I tried to tell them it was stupid," he
said.

Lang said he heard the man de-
nouncing the black-on—black violence
to the crowd.

“It just wasn't worth going to jail
for,” the man said.

Council to consider housing plans

Washington Street and is authorized
to begin commotion at any time.

King said the Planning Commis-
sion has voted to table its proposal
for new zoning regulations, which
were supposed to be submitted for
approval by Council this week and
would go into effect July 1.

The proposed rules would allow
only three noise or litter violations
annually for single family dwellings
housing more than four unrelated
people.

If the occupants were convicted of
more than three violations, they could
lose their conditional use permit. In
such a case, any additional tenants
would have to move out.

The Plarming Commission decided
to delay the implementation of the
regulation when it discovered that
buildings requiring a permit to house
more than four unrelated people had
not been adequately inspected.

“The inspection of the houses
was inadequate and the requirements
were not fully met," said King. “The

Planning Commission tabled all appli-
cations for the conditional use permits
and will bring a recommendation to
Council when the inspections are
properly conducted.”

King said the conditional use
permit is granted if a structure meets
certain criteria, including health and
safety requirements.

City council has set a July 1
deadline for landlords to apply for a
conditional use permit.

King said structures like frater-
nity houses and dormitories are zoned
like apartment buildings, and the new
zoning regulations would not apply.

Two new members of Council
were elected Tuesday and will take
office in July. According to The News
Gazette, they are Patrick Mayerchak,
political science professor at Virginia
Military Institute, and Timothy Gold-
en, VMI’s director of financial aid.
Leaving Cotmcil will be J.E. "Jim"
Mays and Laurence A. Mann, who
both did not seek re—e1ection.

out for the event. Staff photo by

harassment includes, but is not limit-
ed to, threats or actions that are
intended to use ethnic, racial, reli-
gious or sexual characteristics” in
one of three ways: to “insult, harm,
embarass or demean”; to “create a
hostile or intimidating environment”;
or to “discriminate against an in-
dividual in any course, program or
social activity."

The CRC proposed other changes
in its definition of sexual harassment,
which now refers to “verbal or phys-
ical conduct of a sexual nature when

submission to such conduct is made
either explicitly or implicitly a term
or condition of an individual’s em-
ployment or status in a course, pro-
gram or activity.”

The new description of sexual
harassment instead refers to “verbal
or physical acts of a sexual nature"
that are committed “by force, threat
or intimidation” or “through the use
of a victim’s mental or physical
condition or incapacity of which the
perpetrator was, or should have been,
aware.”

At the 5:00 mark, senior mid-
ﬁelder Jim Jones, who had been out
with a knee injury, scored from 15-
yards out as Mastrogiovarmi screening
Redd on the crease to give the Gen-
erals a 6-1 lead.

Garliss then was the ber1eiir;iary
of an outstanding team play in behind
the H-SC net. As Mastrogiovanru had

air: defeat the Tigers 14-10 on

trouble picking up a loose ball, senior
dcfensernan Mike lwlunan leveled the
H-SC defensernan and Mastrogiovanni
was able to gain control. Mastic-
giov:mn,i headed to the goal and hit
Garliss, who scored on a textbook
two on one break.

“Mike [Ntuian] has been probably
our most consistent defensive player

ders

this year,” said Stagnitta. “Mike is
also very aggressive, and that’s just
the way he is. He makes some big
hits‘. but he also gets out of position
because of his aggressiveness. With
Mike, you just have to accept that.”

W&L led 7-3 after the first quar-
ter, but H-SC cut the lead to 7-4 to
start the second period. With 8:00 left
in the half, junior attackman Mike
Moseman and Mastrogiovanni worked
another perfect two-on-one break. As
he was slashed on the head, Mose-
man was able to thread the needle
with a pass to Mastrogiovanni on the
run, and Mastrogiovanni was able to
beat Redd under the crossbar to give
W&L an 8-4 lead.

After another H-SC goal, W&L
went on the extra-man offense. The
Generals worked the ball behind to
Moseman. As two cutters went to the
net, Moseman fed Garliss 15-yards
out, and, with 1:02 left in the half,
his shot beat Redd for his third goal
of the day to give W&L a 9-5 half-
time lead.

In the third quarter, with Tripp
Heilig in goal, the Tigers cut the
W&L lead to 11-9 with 1:06 to play.
But just 12 seconds later, Roberts had
the answer, off a feed from Garliss,
for his third goal of the day and
pushed the lead back to 12-9 to start
the fourth quarter.

Jones then put the game out of
reach with two fourth-quarter goals,
both unassisted, to give the Generals
a 14-9 lead. H-SC scored on a two-
man advantage with just 15 seconds

Track teams
fare well in
ODAC meets

By John Neumann
Staff Reporter

   

In Saturday’s Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference championships, the
Washington and Lee women’s track
team captured the unofficial crown
behind Beth Stutzrnann while Wes
Boyd led the men's charge that fell
just ﬁve points short of the title.

The men ran well and had strong
contributions from everyone down the
line but could not catch Lynchburg
College, the eventual winner.

Head coach Norris Aldridge said,
“Obviously, you’re disappointed
every time you don't win, but we had
a great effort from our team. Every-
one did what they could and we had
an outstanding performance.’ ’

Boyd, a senior, was voted ODAC
Runner—of-the—Year with a tremendous
effort last Saturday. He won the 100-
meter run, 200-meter run, and ran a
leg on both relay teams, the 4x100-
meter winning relay and the second-
place 4x400-meter relay.

Senior Scott Williams also con-
tributed. He won the 400-meter rim
with a time of 48.9 seconds. Wil-
liams also participated on both relay
teams and took third in the 200-meter
run.
Junior Carl Gilbert kept busy all
day participating in ten events. He
ﬁnished second in the long jump de-
spite setting the school record. He
also took fourth in the 200-rneter run
and sixth in the 100—meter run. Gil-
bert also ran a leg on both relay
teams.

Junior David Martin accomplished
a rare feat. He won both the 1500-
and the 5000-meter runs. Junior Jeff
Baucum ran his best 800-meter run
breaking 2:00 for the first time in his
career.

Freshman David Phillips, harn-
pered by a hamstring injury through-
out most of the season, ran the 400-
meter intermediate hurdles and tin-
ished a second with a time of 56.2
seconds.

“It was a great day,” is how
women’s head coach John Tucker
described his team’s performance.
The women’s 172 points outdistanced
Eastern Mennonite by 31 points.

At the head of the women’s class
was Beth‘ Stutzmarui. The senior set
three school records while winning
five individual events, accumulating
60.5 team points. Besides winning the
100-meters, 200—metcrs, hurdles, long
jump and high jump. Stutzmann was
second in the triple jump and ran a

Morris, men
defend crown

By Jay Plotkln
Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee men's
tennis team ﬁnished the regular sea-
son in familiar fashion, wimiing the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament held April 27-28 in
Lynchburg.

The Generals, led by defending
NCAA Division III singles and dou-
bles champion John Morris, finished
10 points ahead of Lynchburg, who
ﬁnished second.

Morris, a senior, defended his
championship at No. 1 singles with
three straight set wins, defeating J.P.
Simanis of Hampden-Sydney 6-1, 6-
2 in the quarterfmals, winning his
semiﬁnal match 7-5, 6-0 and handing
Laurent Oomec of Bridgewater his
first loss of the year 7-5, 6-1 in the
final.

Morris earned ODAC Player-of-
the-Year honors for the second
straight year. He teamed with junior
Bill Meadows to win the No. 1 dou-
bles ﬂight, defeating Tom Sullivan
and Todd Klyver of Lynchburg 6-3,
6-2 in the ﬁnals. Morris and Mead-
ows are currently ranked tenth in the
nation in doubles play.

With his two championships,
Morris now becomes an eight-time
ODAC champion, winning both of
his ﬂights in all four years he has
played

The Generals won ﬁve of the six
singles ﬂights and the No. 1 doubles
ﬂight. It was the first time since
1986 that the team did not win all
nine ﬂights. In 1986, W&L was
defeated at the No. 1 singles ﬂight.

“The challenge this year was to
win all nine ﬂights," said head coach
Gary Franke. “We weren't able to do
that, but we still were able to come

To his teammates and friends
Chris Mast.rogiovanni is simply
known as Mastro. Perhaps they
should insert an ‘e’ to his nick-
name, preferring instead to call
him Maestro.

For that is what Mastro-
giovanni has become this season
for W&L’s lacrosse team, a mas-
ter in the art of scoring, exhibit-
ing eminence as the conductor of
the offensive attack.

Although the Generals played
only three games in April, Mas-
trogiovanni, a key to W&L’s
1990 lacrosse resurgence, scored
nine goals. He had a career-high
six goals, the first two coming in
a 13-second span, in a 25-1 vic-
tory over Virginia Wesleyan, one
goal in a 12-4 loss to No. 2
Washington College and two
goals in a 14-10 win over No. 16
Harnpden-Sydney.

For his acheivements, Mastro—
giovanni has been named The
Ring-tum Phi’s Athlete-of-the-
Month for April.

Mastrogiovanni’s accomplish-
ments are even more impressive
when viewed against the backdrop
of the entire season. After 12
games the seniAoratt_a_c_lgnan from

The Ring-tum Phl, May 3, 1990

[ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH‘

Geneva, N.Y., has 41 points with
36 goals and ﬁve assists.

What is more striking is his
accuracy. His goal scoring has
come from only 79 shots, giving
him a shooting percentage of 45.6
per cent, which is oddly high for
a lacrosse player. As a compari-
son, W&L’s leading scoring in
basketball this year, Chris Jacobs,
shot 44.0 percent.

Mastrogiovanrii has also regis-
tered eight hat tricks this season
and he scored 19 goals during a
four-game stretch. He scored ﬁve
goals against No. 6 Gettysburg,
including the garne—winner with
:44 remaining in overtime. He
collected ﬁve goals and an assist
in a 13-11 win over Middlebury,
scoring twice in 28 seconds, and
picked up three more goals in a
13-12 overtime win at No. 15
Guilford.

Playing on the crease of a low
double stack offense, Mastro-
giovanrii is W&L’s go~to guy,
beneﬁtting from passes from
attackrnen Mike Moseman and
Jeff Roberts and midﬁelders Todd
Garliss and Clark Wight. The
offense is designed for Mastro-
giovanni and it is his job to ﬁnish
the break and get the goals.

“I expected to do this well
(this season),” Mastrogiovarmi

said. “I feel at home on the
crease as an attackman. We have
a new coach [Jim Stagnitta] and
before the season he said that I
move well off the ball. He
thought that attack was where I
would help the team the most.”

Mastrogiovanni played his first
three seasons at midﬁeld, where
he was the most-improved player
in 1988. As a freshman he had
two goals and two assists for the
team that advanced to the Div-
ision III Final Four. As a soph-
omore and junior, when W&L
was 2-11 and 4-9, he had a total
of 24 goals.

Heading into Sunday's game
against VMI the Generals, 8-4,
have an outside chance of making
the eight-team NCAA tournament.

“Everyone’s pretty excited and
happy that we're winning again,
especially the seniors. We have
people playing in positions where
they’ll give the best output,"
Mastrogiovarmi said.

Set to graduate next month
with a degree in psychology,
Mastrogiovanni said he plans to
continue his involvement in the
game he has played since the ﬁfth
grade.

“I’ll probably play in a sum-
mer league and maybe a club
team. Hopefully I’m going to do

some coaching.”

The Generals are currently ranked
13th in the nation, and only 12 teams
will receive bids to the NCAA tour-
narnent. Said Frarike, “Right now,
it's between Rochester, St. John’s and
W&L, and I honestly don’t know
who will make the tournament. There
are no real difference between the
teams.”

Bids will be given out on May
14. The Generals have been to the
tournament each of the last four
years, winning the National Champi-
onship in 1988.

tie for ﬁfth place in the individual
standings.

Thomas was selected ODAC Golf-
er of the Year and Piatt was named
Coach of the Year. But when Piatt
and the team returned to Lexington,

he presented Leslie with the placque.
Said Piat, “This is Buck's team. I
was just lucky enough to keep the
boat in the right direction. The award
is a credit to the strength of the golf
program that Buck has put together
here at'W&L.”

Next the Generals will have to
wait until May 14 to see if the sea-
son will continue. “May I4 is when
the conference call will take place to
give out NCAA tournament bids,”
said Piatt. “It looks very good that
we will get a team bid.”

“If you win your conference,”
said Leslie, “then they [the NCAA]
have to take a long look at you. We
haven't played as many rounds as
some other teams, but we have the
advantage that we won the confer-
ence, and that will get us a long
loo .”

Should the team get a bid or not,
Thomas will also be submitted for an
individual bid. The NCAA touma-
ment will be held the weekend of
May 19.

On the day, Roberts, Garliss and
Jones had three goals apiece, while
Mastrogiovanni and Wight added two
each. Junior goalie Tom Costello
came up big when he had to, making
12 saves.

Although he didn’t score, Chris
Kennedy had to be the star of the
game for W&L. The senior faceoff
specialist won an amazing 27 of 28
and the last 19 he took. Senior de-
fensman Reid Campbell won the only
faceoff he attempted as the Generals
won 28 of 29 and the last 20 on the
afternoon.

“Aside from the games against
Virginia and Washington College,
Chris has been pretty much dominat-
ing the faceoffs," said Stagnitta.
“He's been doing a great job of
getting us the ball when we need it
in the pressure situations."

The Tigers elected to play man-
to-man defense throughout, and that
proved to be their downfall. Continu-
ally W&L offensive players would
beat their deferisernen and no one
would slide to help out for the Ti-
gers, leaving wide open shots.

“We knew they would play man-
to—man at the beginning because they
knew we were adept at playing

against the zone," said Stagnitta.
“l’ve seen them play games where
they have slip well and games when
they haven't. Sunday they didri’t slide

well at all." _

“We were able to open up a big
lead. Once we got the big lead. they
had to play man. If they switch to
zone, then we just be patient and
work the ball around."

The Generals, 8-4, 3-2 in Old
Dominion Athletic Conference play,
defeated Harnpden—Sydney and tin-
ished over .500 in ODAC play for
the first time since 1987, when they
went to the NCAA Division III Final
Four. This season the Generals have
defeated four teams ranked in the
Division III Top 20 (H-SC was rank-
ed 16th).

W&L will close out the season
Saturday at 3:00 on Wilson Field in
the Third Annual Lee-Jackson La-
crosse Classic against cross-town rival
VMI. W&L won last year 10-9 on
Douoguih’s goal in sudden-deatli
overtime.

“It's a big game for us," said
Stagnitta. “We have to win to keep
our goal of being in the playoffs
alive. And for the seniors, it's their
last opportunity to shine.”

The other dominating woman was
sophomore LaShawn King, who won
the 400-meter run while setting a
school record of 63.08 seconds. She
also took second place in the high
jump, third in the long jump, fourth
in the 200-meters and sixth in the
100-meters. She also participated in
both relays.

Said Tucker, “We won the meet
with fewer girls than EMC so most
girls were in multiple events." Tuc-
ker called the day an “endurance
test” and was pleased with his team
and the steady progress they made
throughout the year was very gratify-
ing for a coach.

Both the men and women lose
valuable performers off their teams.
The women lose Stutzmann. Howev-
er, even though Tucker is sorry to
see her leave, he has three freshmen
coming in who he feels will make up
that difference along with his retum-
ing team members.

The men lose Boyd, pole-vaulter
Phillip Sampson, sprinter Tie Sos-
nowski, and Williams. Aldridge also
wishes that they could remain, but he
knows he has a strong nucleus retum-
ing, including Gilbert, Martin, and
Baucurn.

East Lex

Jim Bowen discusses his ownership of a W&L tradition

By Todd Peppers
Entertainment Columnist

At the end of last week's review,
I remarked that my next column
would explore the wondrous delights
of East Lex. I meant it to be a joke.
tlnfortunately, my editors didn’t catch
the subtle (asinine) humor and
promptly allotted space for my arti-
cle. When I learned of their confu-
sion my first reaction was, well,
unprintable. Then I began to think
about it. A story on East Lex...why
not? To many Washington and Lee
students East Lex rivals House Moun-
tain and Goshen as a permanent, and
beloved, landmark of the area.

"There has been an East Lex
since l936," said owner James ‘Jim’
Bowen. "Back in the old days this
used to be a coun store. There
were no Krogers at that time, and
East Lex carried grain, feed, coal,
and even salt blocks. The store also
had a lunch counter and delivered
groceries to its customers."

A store similar to East Lex can
be found in every small town in the
United States. Although the building
has not completely escaped the rav-
ages of time, it has an air of serenity
and permanence. The store sits on
the side of Rt. 11, bearing a faded
sign that says "East Lexington Store
Quick Stop." Metal signs proclaim-
ing "Rainbo is Good Bread" and
"Marlboro Man" dot the building's
sides. Two gasoline pumps stand
guard in front of the store. Trucks
and cars are placed haphazardly
across the parking lot. This Norman
Rockwell painting only lacks an
ancient hound dog sleeping in the
shade.

Inside the air is motionless and
cool. The shelves are stuffed with
every conceivable item: ﬁshing tackle,
shotgun shells, bread, comcob pipes,
beef jerky, shirts, newspapers, ﬁre-
works, Elvis bubble gums cards,
lunch meats, cups, pickles, Red Man
chewing tobacco, baseball hats, and
tooth-ache drops. The store even
sells the kind of magazines that
mother wouldn’t let into the house.
And the silence is broken by the

muted hum of two beer coolers.

"I used to say that East Lex car-
ried everything from lite beer to light
bulbs," said Jim. ‘'1 stock just about
everything. The only things I don’t
have that people ask for are wine and
fishing licenses."

Granted the store is crammed with
endless supplies. Yet Washington
and Lee students think of two things
when the name East Lex pops up in
conversation: Beer specials and Jim
Bowen. If you are having that Satur-
day night poker party, or your Frater-

nity is throwing an intimate party for,

ﬁve hundred close friends, then most
likely you arrive at East Lex to check
out Jim's legendary specials.

"We carry all the domestic beers
and four or five of the best selling
imported beers," according to Jim,
-who added that he tries to have a
special posted all the time. The
weekly specials are tacked to the
‘cooler door. On Saturday night stu-
dents can be found huddled around
the sign as they scrutinize prices.

And now, a little about Jim Bow-

en. It is in.’ mceivable to imagine
East Lex without Jim, or vice versa.
"I have owned East Lex for fourteen
years," said Jim. "I lived down the
road from the store when I was a
child, and started working here when
I was thirteen ’of"‘fourteen. With the
money I earned from my job, I was
able to send myself to the University
of Richmond."

Jim graduated from the University
of Richmond in 1970 and returned to
Lexington. He taught at the local
high school and coached both the
baseball team and the junior varsity
basketball team. But in the late
1970s he returned to his boyhood
haunt and assumed his place in the
Washington and Lee psyche. And
for many of his customers, whether
they be Washington and Lee students,
Virgiiﬁa Military Institute cadets, or
local folks, Jim is a good friend.

"During the fourteen years I have
worked here, the problems I have had
with the fraternities you could count
on one hand. It has been a good
relationship."

bubble gum cards and has become

Jim added that "the students who
come into the store I consider friends,
and I hope they consider me a friend.
They are another part of my job that
makes it a pleasure."

Jim spends a lot of time behind
the counter. "I probably spend be-
tween seventy-five to eighty hours a
week at work." He also has two or
three ladies who help him out. East
Lex is opened from 9:00 a.m. to
12:00 a.m. every day of the year
except, of course, for Christmas. But
don't panic--Christmas day Jim opens
up the store around noon.

Peppers is not going to give East
Lex a grade-—I am neither old nor
wise enough to pass judgement on a
Washington and Lee tradition. If you
are that lucky junior who has just
turned 21, then don’t make the mis-
take of buying your beer, cigars, and
fishing tackle (okay--I'm stretching it
a bit) from a cold and uncaring con-
venience store. Go somewhere where
the owner knows your name, and
who would just as soon chat as sell
