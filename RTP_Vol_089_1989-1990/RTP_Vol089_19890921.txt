Marchers
.stop over
on way
to .C.

By Lee Fleming
- Staff Reporter

More than 150 marchers stopped
over in Lexington Tuesday on their
way to a rally for the homeless to
be held in Washington, D.C. on
Oct.7.

X’ The group is part of Housing

'Now, an organization described by
group leader Rev. David Hayden as
“an ad-hoc coalition dedicated to
staging a massive rally, also called
Housing Now, for the homeless.”

Hayden has been an advocate for
the poor and homeless in Roanoke
( for a number of years.

While in Lexington, marchers
stayed in tents on the property of
the New Hope Church of God in
Christ located on Vamer Lane, and
Gladys House, a privately-funded
shelter located next door.

The marchers represent every
southern state except Louisiana,
Hayden said. They assembled in
Roanoke on Sept.l4 and left the
next day in trucks, cars and on foot.

“This is the southern part‘ of the
New Exodus March, a pilgrimage of
the poor out of the South to
Washington. Our people are
equivalent to the poor slaves who
left Egypt in the original Exodus, ”
Hayden said.

The northern section of the New
Exodus left New York at 5 a.m.
Wednesday, he said.

The most signiﬁcant fact about
the marchers, Hayden said, is that
they are largely composed Of
homeless people, or people (Who
- have at one time been homeless.

“We are being led by people
who have slept in the streets, eaten
out of garbage cans, and had
children taken away by social
workers. This is the voice of the
poor being raised up. No longer will
middle—class folks speak for us,” he
said.

Dewayne Saunders, a _marchcr
from Atlanta, said he had just lost
his job when he heard about the
march and Housing Now.

Like most of the other marchers,

many of them illiterate, he said he

learned of the march by “word-of-
‘ mouth."

On 0ct.7, the New Exodus
marchers will join with thousands of
other Americans in Washington for
a rally marching down Constitution
Avenue to the Capitol.

Tax dispute continues

By Jim Pike
and Brian Root
of The Ring-tum Phi staff

Lexington officials remain con-
fused about whether students whose
vehicles are registered outside of
Virginia will have to pay Lex-
ington’s personal property tax.

‘ According to the city’s chief tax
collector, out-of-state students will
not be subject to the tax. But the
city manager, earlier this month,
said students will have to pay the
difference between any taxes at
home and the tax here.

Earlier this week, Lexington
Commissioner of Revenue Courtney
Baker said that, to avoid the tax, a
student car-owner simplyimust show
the city a tax receipt from his home
state.

But Lexington City Manager Jo-
seph King, in a letter to The Ring-
tum Phi dated Sept. 15, stood by his
claim that students may be forced to
pay the difference.

King said that, according to Vir-
ginia law, if an individual can prove
he has paid taxes in a jurisdiction
other than his home - in this case,
Lexington — then he “may obtain a
refund from that jurisdiction.”

The net effect of that law on
students, King said, would be pay-
ing Lexington the difference be-
tween their home-state taxes and
Lexington’s. ‘

But King said that section and
another create “an apparent contra-

I diction.”

Section 58.1-3511 of the code
says, “Any person domiciled in an-
other state, whose motor vehicle is
principally garaged or parked in this
commonwealth during the tax year,
shall not be subject to a personal
tax on such vehicle upon a showing

‘watch out’

in last days of rush

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

With the formal rush period
coming to an end, Washington and
Lee’s fraternities were warned to be
more careful about controlling
underage drinking at parties and to
restrict illegal rush activities.

“Don’t blow it," said IFC
President Kevin Nash at the
lntcrfrateinity Council meeting
Tuesday night. “There's only a
couple more days of Rush left, so
please don’t do anything that could
get you into trouble.”

Nash told the houses two fresh-
men were admitted to Stonewall
Jackson Hospital for alcohol
poisoning, and asked the houses to
carefully watch freshmen for signs
of intoxication.

“This weekend (when freshmen
can accept bids from a house) wil_
.bc worse than normal,” Nash said.\’
“So if you see a freshman drinking

too much,‘ try to slow him down
and get him home safely.”
Nash reminded the houses Live

Drive will be operating this
weekend.
Associate Dean of Students

Leroy C.“Buddy” Atkins asked the
houses to bring what he called a
“traditional sense of decorum”
while freshmen accept their bids on
Friday and Saturday night.

“You have to look at this from
the police’s perspective,” said
Atkins. “If there's a lot of guys
wrestling half-naked around on the
floor after someone tears (accepts
his bid), it looks weird, and it is
weir ."

Atkins said there have been
some complaints to the police
concerning glass bottles
thrown from fraternities.

“The sound of breaking glass is
the first thing the police listen for
to determine if a party has gotten
out of control,” Atkins said.

Fourth sorority named

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Delta Gamma, the national sister
fraternity to Phi Delta Theta, was
chosen Thursday evening to be the
fourth women’s fraternity to
colonize at Washington and Lee.

After hearing presentations from
both Delta Gamma and Pi Beta Phi

'last week, the Panhellenic Extension
Committee approved Delta Garrirna’s
application. Then, the committee's

decision was approved by the entire
Panhellenic Council, which
coordinates all sorority matters at
W&L.

“On paper, Delta Garrirna and Pi
Beta Phi were equally strong," said
Wendy Wilson, panhellenic
publicity, housing, and extension
chairwoman. “It basically came
down to the fact that Delta
Gamma‘s presentation was better.”

Delta Gamma was invited to
conduct presentations on 83 college
campuses this year. Of those, only

four were accepted. by the women’s
fraternity.

The Extension Committee is
currently deciding how to
incorporate Delta Gamma into the
formal sorority rush, which is
scheduled for January.

In addition, other details, such as

adding the new sorority to the
Panhellenic letterhead, must be
handled.

“From now on, Delta is

officially part of our Panhellenic
system,” Wilson said.

of sufficient evidence that such per-
son has paid a personal property tax
on the vehicle in the state in which
he is domiciled.”

And King said that section of
the code “indicates that, whatever
personal property tax they may have
paid on out—of-state vehicles, wheth-
er higher or lower, would exempt
them from any local tax.”

Baker, the official responsible
for assessing property taxes, said
she was surprised by the theory that

out-of-state students could have to
pay the difference. She said that, as
far as she knows, there has been no
talk of taxing out—of-state students at
all. But she did not want to speak
further until she could consult King.

Baker later said out-of-state stu-
dents meeting the guidelines set
forth by the Virginia code would be
exempt.

She did say, however, that in-
state students could still be required
to pay a tax.

Wilson won’t tax cars

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

Despite Lexington’s six-month
old plans to levy a personal
property tax on cars belonging to
Washington and Lee students, the
city has not yet formally contacted
the school to ask for its cooperation,
said W&L President John D.
Wilson.

“We have not, at least not to
my knowledge, received any official
word from the city that they’ intend
to tax student cars,” Wilson said.

According to Wilson, the only
contact with any city official about
the car tax came when Wilson
wrote a letter early this summer to
Lexington Mayor H.E “Buddy”
Derrick concerning a possibile car
tax. Derrick wrote back, saying the
city did, in his view, have legal
grounds to assess the property tax.

“They (city officials) are under
no obligation to inform us,
however," Wilson said. “I don’t
hold the city in default of any
responsibility to me.”

However, Wilson said, if the city
requests W&L’s list of student car
registration, there may .be legal
questions. The 1974 Buckley
Amendment restricts the release of
student records to any source not
explicitly premitted by the student.

“That law was meant to cover

student transcripts and grade
reports,” Wilson said. “But, it could
be construed to cover car
registrations as well. If we were
asked to provide records of

students’ car registration to the tax-
collecting authorities, we would
certainly have to get a legal opinion
about it.”

“In many instances, we have to
work with the police,” said Wilson.
“Continued good relations with the‘
city are very important.

“Frankly, however, I don’t want
to make Washington and Lee a tax-
collecting agency for the city or
county,”said Wilson.

Wilson said the city could skirt
any possible legal questions by
contacting all of W&L students
instead of attempting to contact only
those who have cars in Lexington.

33 years, WIII be inducted inl0 W&L’s Athletic Hall of Fame tomorrow.

OPINION

Ignorance breeds‘
racial tensions

Once again a situation has arisen on the Washington
and Lee campus where minority students feel they have
been insulted or alienated by an action or statement.
Unfortunately, these circumstances arise on a relatively
frequent scale due to the ingrained “Old South”
traditionalism and heritage that play such a large role in
W&L’s past and present. Often it is this traditionalism
that leads to complaints from minority students.

An example of the above is the 1988 ‘Minority
Student Association boycott of Fancy Dress, whose
theme that year was “Reconciliation Ball of 1865.”
The president of the MSA maintained that the choice of
theme was made with no consideration for black
students who couldn’t enjoy a theme “set in a period
where blacks were oppressed.”

But the surprise that the non—black students felt is
indicative of what is perhaps the root of the racial tension
at W&L — oversight, insensitivity, unawareness. Perhaps
if we non-minority students were more conscious of the
way certain icons and images appear to minority students
and thought twice before publicly invoking these
controversial icons and images, the racial “tension” (for
lack of a better word) that exists on this campus would be
greatly reduced. All it would require is a bit of
forethought and some consideration. We would like to
believe, as most W&L students probably do, that most
perceived racial affronts are not intentional. We think we
- are beyond being attracted to that ignominious aspect,
although several other admirable and romantic traditions of
the South do still ﬂourish.

But on the other hand (and there always is another
hand), we would also like to point out that despite the
university’s efforts to ease minority students’ transition to
W&L life, that in some ways the university’s attempts
may only be augmenting any problems. Granted, all
segments of the student body have a right and an interest
in maintaining a student organization that furthers their
interests, but it often seems that the university continues
to segregate the minority students, in spirit, at least, far
beyond any social or cultural necessity. There is minority
recruitment, minority counseling, minority orientation,
minority job opportunities, a minority newsletter, a dean
for minority affairs and so on. _low can the university
expect the students to integrate if they are constantly
being reminded that they are in the minority? How can
the majority help but to treat them in a different manner,
since the university has indoctrinated in both the minority

students and the non-rriinority students that they are
' ‘different.’ ’ '

immediately sets the incoming freshman minority students
away from their classmates. The ﬁrst people these
minority students meet are other minority students,’ so
naturally, the first friends these students will have on
campus are other minority students. It seems to be a
somewhat self-defeating cycle.

We can’t help but feel if everyone would stop labelling
these students minority students, that they would perhaps
feel less separated from the rest of the student body. If
one is constantly being reminded of his nationality or
race, it seems to us that it would be a little more difficult
to assimilate.

Also, the extensive attention that the minority students
receive engenders among the non-minority students ' a
feeling that the these students are receiving “special
treatment.” Whether this is the case is not the question,
but once again the separation is widened by the
university’s attempts to welcome the minority students.

So yes, the racial situation is often confusing and
difficult, but it seems that there are logical and simple
solutions that are based in one simple action — being
aware. The university needs to be aware of outside
perceptions of all the minority programming, and how that
affects non-minority students’ viewpoints. As for us
students, we all need to be particularly aware of how
what we say and do impacts those around us, minority
and non-minority students alike, for it requires only an
adult consideration of others, and at this point in our lives
we should all be capable of at least that.

MY VIEW
By James Lake

With the clouds of world war
circling, Winston Churchill observed,
“We seem to be very near the bleak
choice between War and Shame. My
feeling is that we shall choose
Shame, and then have War thrown in
a little later, on even more adverse
terms than at present."

Would that someone had repeated
those words on March 16, 1985. That
was the day Associated Press reporter
Terry Anderson was taken hostage in
Lebanon. Now, more than four years
later and with eight Americans held
hostage instead of one, the shame
keeps mounting. And, this summer,
many Americans added to our shame
tby condemning the one nation ’will-.
lingto try to stop .it: Israel. '

We all know what prompted the
criticism of Israel: the apparent mur-
der of a ninth hostage, U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins. and the
videotape thereof. Israel, its critics
say, brought on Higgins’ murder by
kidnapping Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid. And perhaps the critics are
right — by the same reasoning that
says police who arrest thieves lead
thieves’ children to hate the police.

Read a recent headline from U.S.
News & World Report: “Inaction is
another form of hanging.” From that
noose we saw on television, along
with the body of Higgins, hanged
America herself. For even now, when
the hostages are gone from the front
pages and the nightly newscasts, the
U.S. is plagued with what Roger
Rosenblatt of U.S. News calls “this
dreadful impotency, this wasting and
deadening of the rational, decent spir-
it." We are painfully afflicted with a

frustration born not out of failed at-
tempts at retaliation but out of not
even trying to retaliate.

And so, like Great Britain and
France giving Hitler one morsel of
Europe after another, America's
shame mounts. Israel has shown us
an example of moral courage, the
kind President Ronald Reagan exer-
cised occasionally but abandoned in
favor of a disastrous attempt to ap-
pease the hostage—takers’ cohorts. He
disgraced one of his greatest virtues:
moral courage. He shufﬂed the deck
of national priorities and put the
lives of current hostages ahead of the
lives of potential hostages and ahead
of our nation's honor. Such a re-
stacking is politically easy, because
most American voters are too short-
sighted to realize that the deaths of
soldiers and today's hostages may be
the price for an end to the nightmare
and for the security of future travel-

ers. George Bush, if he ever owned!-
tliis courage — and one supposes the'
World War H pilot once did — has‘
either abandoned it or subordinated itr
to other goals. f
Courage does not mean rage. '

tage problem, an answer that will

THE SBAR SIDE
By John Sbar

Recently I woke up with a headache, a stuffy
nose and thousands of chirping crickets ewho are
under the impression that my bedroom is a Certi-
fied Cricket Migration Zone. Therefore, I left for
the school infirmary, abandoning my domicile to
the crickets who would spend the day breeding,
jumping up and down, and ﬁguring out why I
sometimes refer to my bedroom as a domicile. At

‘the infirmary I read pamphlets on the subject of

sexually-transmitted diseases, drug abuse, and why
you shouldn't scratch your genital area when you
have poison ivy. Once admitted to the doctor I sat
down, scratched my genital area, and vowed to
stop writing rythmic sentences with three—pronged
descriptive phrases.

While the doctor killed time checking me out
with her orifice-probing devices, I wondered how
long it would take her to declare my illness a

normal process of orifice-probing, Viral Infection
Declaration and horse-pill dispensation, the doctor
declared my illness a cut lip, and proceeded to
give me painful Novacain shots and four stiches.

The obvious lesson to be learned from my
infirrnary experience is this: Mere mortals who
tempt Fate and forget to knock on some wood-
en surface afterwards will become the butt of
one of Fate’s many jokes. Of course, this wasn't
the first time an article got me in trouble with
Fate. Last year, ten minutes after writing in sup-
port of the famous “Milk Bone Arziendment"
which would have outlawed leashes and other
dog—restn'cting devices, I rode my bike by a big
bloodthirsty German Shepherd who just so hap-
pened to be off-leash. This dog who made Rin-
tin-tin look like Morris the Cat, chased me for
about a mile until I narrowly escaped by riding
straight into the Maury River.

Oh... by the way, in case you're wondering, I
cut my lip fighting off six-armed Ninjas who
ambushed me in the library elevator. Contrary to
a popular rumor. I was not elbowed in the mouth
during water nolo practice.

Trees spotted,
forest missed,
says student

On May 4 last spring, I wrote a “My
View” discussing Michigan State University’s
affirmative action policy. At Michigan State,
students complete general education require-
ments, and then apply for admission to the
various schools (business, education, etc). In
the formula used, points are added to the
scores of minority students, as an affirmative
action policy. I stated that this policy was ef-
fectively discriminatory, providing some stu-
dents with an advantageous position because of
their race. A policy such as this hurts every-
one. Descrving non-minority students are de-
nied a place in the school of their choice, and
deserving minority students are cheapened to
the extent that this allows their detractors to
attribute their success to race and not ability.
The only persons who benefit are undeserving
minority students who would not have been

' able to gain admission without special treat-
ment.

In the May 18 issue of The Ring—tum Phi,
Joyce G. MacDonald took me to task regarding
the use of the passive voice in my column,

‘saying, “Choosing the passive instead of the
"active voice enables the writer, consciously or
unconsciously, to fudge an apparently definite
position, to distance himself from conclusions
whose implications he may not be ready to
embrace fully or even recognize.”

Viral infections at the infirmary?

‘Ms. MacDonald appears to have missed the
proverbial forest due to her close scrutiny of
the trees. Apparently, in the course of her en-
thusiastic quest to criticize my writing style,
she chose to ignore the thrust of my argu-
ments. She accuses me of “fudging an appar-
ently definite position,” but retreats from chal-
lenging my position. My view is quite simple,
to the extent that affirmative action singles out
a minority, it is discriminatory. Referring to it
as anything else involves a semantic game
contrived to camouﬂage its true nature.

Finally, I must take issue with Ms. Mac-
Donald’s assertion that “racist reactions both
follow affirmative action policies and necessi-
tated their introduction.” First, outraged reac-
tions from non-minority students who have
been deprived opportunities as a result of affir-
mative action are not racist. The reaction is not
to the race of the person who took their place
as a result of affirmative action, but rather a
reaction to a policy which allows someone an
unfair advantage over them. Their reaction is
not that of a Ku Klux Klan member to a mi-
nority member moving into the neighborhood,
but rather that of an athlete who discovers that
the officials have been bought by the other
team.

Although I strongly support equal opportu-
nity, and am opposed to discrimination on the
basis of race, sex, creed, or color, I can see no
need for affirmative action. As I said in my
earlier opinion, affirmative action is just anoth-
er name for officially sanctioned discrimination.
A rose by any other name...

Apologies are
in order, says
Prof. Futch

With respect to Mr. Green’s letter published
last week, apologies are in order regarding the
publication of the photograph he described that
appears in the new edition of the Calyx. In
today's America the public display of certain
symbols and emblems is completely out of the
question. Everyone must understand this.

Thanks for the opportunity to put this on
the record.

Calyx editors

explain policy .

As editors of the 1989 Calyx, we feel a
statement regarding our policy is in order.

While the Calyx in no way intends to of.
fend any facet of the student body, it has bccn
our policy to allow each senior the privilege of
submitting a picture, for which he or she has
paid, to put in the Calyx. We hope this tram-
tion of individual expression will continue and
that future seniors will be mindful of this when
submitting photographs.

;Theater
;set for
;August
i;completion

,, By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

Construction of Washington and
‘ Lee's new center for the performing
,, arts, the Lenfest Center, is progress-

‘ , ing as scheduled and, should be

fcompleted by August of 1990, ac-
the university's fine arts department.
__ project began in the summer of 1988

‘ donation earmarked for the fine arts

’ center from Mr. and Mrs. Gerry Len-

§fest of Huntingdon Valley, Penn.

‘Lenfest is a 1954 graduate of Wash-

’- ington and Lee.

I In addition to the $9.8 million
éconstruction costs, the university’s
board of trustees has created a $2

4' million endowment, which it says will
 ensure the highest quality arts program
“ for the school and surrounding area.
‘University officials are nearing the
completion of their fund-raising cam-
Qpaign, thanks in part to the “sale”
gof theater seats.
University officials have asked
(Washington and Lee alumni and

*_ friends and local patrons of the arts
to “buy" seats in the 425-seat theater
9 in order to complete fund-raising for
the center. For $2,500, a donor can

I bestow his name and financial support,

‘or honor someone else, while at the
same time support the construction and

' endowment of the theater. Every seat
, that is sold will be marked with a

plaque bearing the name of the donor

I or someone the donor wishes to honor.

The seat-selling campaign was

started last October, and thus far 79

V seats have been sold, according to
‘ Charlene Whiteside of the university’s

development office. Whiteside said
1 donations have been steady since

enactment of the program.

According to Gordon, a number
sof parents of current Washington and
4‘ Lee students have "named a seat” in

honor of their children. In addition, a

‘number of local residents have contrib-

uted to the cause. “Naming a seat in
‘ the theater provides the opportunity for
4. local people to contribute to the build-
ing and be recognized for their sup-

port," Gordon said.

4 The center will be located diago-
nally across from Gaines Hall. En-

ltrance to the center’s upper and lower
«levels will be through a gatehouse
tower, the design of which has been
borrowed from the Gaines Hall gate-
ghouse.

According to a W&L news release,
‘the Lenfest Center's main theater will
‘seat 425, and the rise is designed to

insure that every member of the audi-

V fence has an unobstructed view of the
stage. The stage’s design will allow
for a variety of stage sizes, ranging
l~from very small to multi-level sets, the
release said. The stage will also fea-
‘Lure a hydraulic—powered orchestra lift

oand a shock-absorbing floor designed

for dance.
' The main theater will also be ideal

for concerts and choral presentations,
as the orchestra pit will be large
9enough to hold a 92—piece orchestra or

“a large choral group, said the release.

Joint courthouse
still a possiblity

 

By Brooke Jarbek
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors last week announced
that it would ‘reconsider its original
rejection of joint courthouse facili-
ties for Lexington and Rockbridge
County.

The County Board members or-
iginally rejected the proposal by
Guy 0. Farley for the jointufacitities
because of the $1 million price tag.
However, Farley told both Lexing-
ton City Council and the county's
supervisors that the cost could be
reduced, by issuing industrial reve-
nue bonds and financing the project
through the Industrial Development
Association.

Both city and county officials
agreed that action to start building
the facilities should begin immedi-
ately.

Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Judge Robert S. Culpcpper said
there is “an emergency need to
have a new building.”

Currently, both the county and
city courts are overcrowded, have
no disability access, no meeting
rooms for attorneys and clients, no
holding rooms, no conference rooms
for judges and limited parking.

The problem surfaced more than
two years ago when judges for the
General District Court and Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Courts,

which altemated between the city
and County courthouses, complained
about i!1C space conditions, said
Mayor HE. “Buddy” Derrick, Jr.

Culpcpper said a joint court
would be more convenient for
Rockbridge and Lexington residents
because a citizen would only have
to go to one location.

Judge Joseph E. Hess, who
serves in the Lexington and Rock-
bridge, .County General. District
Courts, said he often sends people
to the other courthouse when they
mistakenly come to him for a juve-
nile-related offense.

“We do not have the
opportunity to grow,
we are not going to
have more retail es-
tablishments. ”
— Buddy Derrick

§)en‘ick said that no matter how
the new court facilities are ﬁnanced,
it is important for them to be within
the corporate city limits.

Unlike Rockbridge County, we
do not have the opportunity to
grt;'.v,” the mayor said. “We are
not going to have more retail estab-
lishmcnts. We have always served
as county seat and service center for
the community, and we feel that
that is where our future lies."

The Spectator no

By Cathy Loplccolo
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee's newest
publication, the ’Spectator, will be
produced this year despite the
refusal by the Publications Board to
recognize and fund the news and
opinion journal, the magazine's
editor-in-chief predicted. _

“The Spectator is alive,
certainly. The Spectator is going to
come out,” junior Paul Lagarde
said.

Plans for the Spectator are still
being discussed, said Lagarde, and
the staff does not know when the
first issue will be published.
Because the Spectator was denied
recognition as an official school
publication, the magazine's only
issue was funded by the staff, he
said.

This year, according to junior
Ray Welder, the magazine's
publisher, the magazine is relying
on donations. "We‘ve gone to
grandmothers, mothers, fathers and
everyone else for help,” he said.

“So far we've collected about
$400, which is not enough to put
out a magazine. We hope to get
donations from sympathetic alunmi
and from advertising,” said Welder.
“Hopefully the first issue will be as

good a product as possible, to
attract financial support.”
Lagarde and Welder, who

founded the Spectator last winter,
presented the magazine to the
Publications Board in an attempt to
become a recognized school
pttblication and to receive school
funding. That board supervises all

VMI waiting
for decision

By Courtney Payne
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute of-
ficials are still waiting to find
out if their school will become
coeducational, Public Irtforrnation
Director Tom Joynes said Tues-
day.

A letter from a northern Vir-
ginia high school student
prompted the U.S Department of
Justice to inquire into the admis-'
sions policies of the college.
The letter was from a female
who was interested in applying
to VMI but told she could not
because they only accept men.

The last official correspon-
dence regarding the matter was
an April 28 reply to the Justice
Department inquiry from Maj.
Gen. John Knapp, Acting Super-
intendent and Dean. The college
and the Justice Department,
however, are not the only parties
involved.In a letter to VMI
Board of Visitors President Jo-
seph M. Spivey III, Virginia
Governor Gerald Baliles wrote,
“I have searched for  ration-
ales to discover moral, legal or
educational judgement why
women, for no reason other than
their gender, should be denied
admission to VMI. My search

university‘ publications, chooses their
editors and approves publication
budgets.

According to Lagarde, the board
granted his magazine “provisional"
approval so that his staff could use
equipment in The Ring-tum Phi
office for their issue, but the board
refused to provide university funds.

Senior Kristi Goodman, chairman
of the Publications Board and editor

of the Political Review, said the
board refused to recognize the
Spectator primarily because its

members felt the magazine would
duplicate the purpose of other
school publications.

I-—-—H—————--HI—---—--

“The Spectator is
alive, certainly. The
Spectator is going to
come out.”

— Paul Lagarde

Also, Goodman said, a secondary
concern of the board was that the
students who run the Spectator
would advocate conservative
ideology through the magazine. The

Publications Board's constitution

bans recognition of any publication »

it determines “states and/or
demonstrates a political or cultural
ideology.”

Lagarde said the monthly
“Spectrum” would allow for more
in-depth analysis of issues than is
possible in weekly publications, like
The Ring-tum Phi, but would be
more frequent than the Political
Review. He also said the magazine
would accept articles from people

spectre

with all political views, although he

admitted the majority of the students
on the Spectator staff are
conservative.

“One thing we'd always want is
a pro-con or conservative-liberal
debate. That argument is always a
highlight of a publication and is one
of the most important things in the
Spectator. But issues may rtot
always be conservative or liberal,"
Lagarde said.

Last spring the board imple-
mented a procedure for recognizing
school publications, in response to
several requests for approval during
the last two years. Welder said
these new guidelines are “strin-
gent,” and he does not know if the
Spectator would be eligible for
approval this year.

The new Publications Board
would be willing to reconsider the
Spectator, Goodman said.

“With the exception of myself,
we have an all-new Publications
Board. We have a new group with
new opinions. I'm willing to
listen,” Goodman said. “I have not
talked to the new members about it,
so I don't know their opinions.”

Welder and Lagarde said they
see some advantages to being
independent from the board, such as
the freedom to choose their own
editors. However, they said not
receiving university funding is a
major disadvantage.

“We're going to do our best to
be as independent as possible,"
Welder said,“but we may not be
able to afford it.”

FDA funds limited

The Washington and Lee Student
Activities Board said it will be
cutting back expenses on this year's
Fancy Dress Ball because of the
reduction in its overall budget for
the 1989-90 school year, the
Executive Committee said at its
meeting Monday night.

According to the EC, the Fancy
Dress expense reduction was one of
several issues concerning the SAB
budget that were discussed in a
meeting last week between members
of the SAB, EC and Associate Dean

of Students Leroy C.“Buddy"
Atkins.

The SAB representatives said
they would be emphasizing

organization and communication this
year. In addition, the SAB said its
weekly meetings will be more
structured and procedures will be
written for members outlining their
duties.

Atkins requested that the EC
outline its general objective
concerning the SAB. He also said
he thinks the SAB should be given
more lead time on budget estimates.

This year, the SAB has come
under increased scrutiny because it
amassed a debt of about $20,000
over the past several years.

EC President Willard Dumas
said he would like to see the SAB
meet with the EC before major
decisions are made.

The EC said it will have its next
meeting with the SAB before
Homecoming weekend.

 Sheriff department
 to augment forces

 

By Karsten Amlle
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors is trying to get more
manpower and better equipment for
the sheriff’s department.

The supervisors unanimously
voted to send a resolution to state
representatives that would request
more manpower be allocated to the
county sheriff’s department.

The vote, which took place at
Monday's Board of Supervisors
meeting, came in the wake of a
shooting incident that occurred last
Saturday in Natural Bridge in which
a sheriff’s deputy and a County Su-

pervisor were both shot. Neither
men were seriously injured.
The shooting incident also

prompted serious and extensive dis-
cussions that led to the Board tak-
ing action to permit certain correc-
tional officers at the Rockbridge Re-
gional Jail to take weapons home.
This would allow off-duty officers
to come to the assistance of sher-
iff’s deputies in emergencies.

The supervisors also said that
they would look into the feasibility
of providing officers with shotguns
and portable radios.

However, the problem that the
-Supervisors and the law enforcement
officers who attended the meeting
spent the most time discussing was
the serious lack of manpower in the
sheriff’s department.

The ratio that the state uses in
allocating funds to sheriff’s depart-
ments is one deputy per 2,000 peo-
ple and one dispatcher 35,000 peo-
ple.

Rockbridge County's sheriff’s
department has 13 deputies to cover
the 600 iriiles of square land. This
only leaves the County with three or
four deputies per shift. It also places
the deputies on a demanding work
schedule; one that Captain Ronald
Hall of the sheriff’s department says
has many deputies putting in a great
deal of overtime.

Sheriff F.M. Spence says that his
office is overworked and could use

twice as many men as they have
now. Unfortunately as long as the
state demands the 2,000 people to
one officer ratio, the sheriff’s de-
partment will very undoubtedly be
permitted to employ more dispatch-
ers or officers.

"If we were fortunate enough to
pick up five men then we would
really feel lucky," said Spence. The
Supervisors voted to ask the

.county’s representatives in the Gen-

eral Assembly to work to get the
state Compensation Board to alter
its funding formula to take into ac-
count not only population but the
size and the" terrain of a county
such as Rockbridge, as well.

H.E “Chunk” Neale, Rockbridge

because, he says, taxpayers would
have to pay less for such services
as heating, electricity, and water.

The Methodist College Monarchs are in their first
year of NCAA football, and last Saturday against the

ESPORTS

Washington and Lee Generals, mistakes, along with a

torrential rain, spelled doom for the first year team.

In front of just over 1,000 fans at Wilson field for
the Generals’ 1989 home opener, Methodist received
the ball to start the game. On their first play from
scrimmage, W&L senior Scott Silverrnan hit Monarch
ball carrier Brett Baxley as he went into the line and
jarred the ball loose. The Generals recovered on the
Methodist 20-yard line. It would be the first of six

turnovers on the day. Methodist fumbled nine times, In the third quancr, it was more of the Same_

losing five.

From there, the Generals‘ offense took over. Junior,
tailback Mason Pope went 12-yards on the first play,
and two plays later, he was on the receiving end of
senior quarterback Phillip Sampson’s first touchdown
pass on the day. The game was 1:10.

Soccer stops Sweet Briar,

By Holly Gooding
Staff Reporter

Three years of hard work are

beginning to pay off for the
Washington and Lee women's
soccer team.

The Generals defeated Old

Dominion Athletic Conference foe
Sweet Briar College 1-0 in a muddy
battle at home last Saturday, and
tied battled ODAC rival Hollins to a
0-0 deadlock in two overtimes at

 ‘I-Iollins on Monday.

The lone goal on Saturday came
midway through the first half.
Freshman midfielder Andrea

-Cardamone broke free and drove the

ball into the goal. Excellent team
defense limited the scoring. The
Generals managed 21 shots on goal
while holding the Vixens to none.
On Monday, the Generals
uavelcd to Hollins ready to continue
their high level of play. Said W&L
head coach Jan Hathorn of the play

Corrections

In last week’s women‘s soc-

cer article, Catherine Baillio was
incorrectly identified as a team
captain. The co-captains are Sa-
rah Allen and Joelle Jackson.
Sweet Briar is not the defending
ODAC champions, but ended the
Generals’ season last year in the
tournament semifinals. Also, the
midfield line head coach Jan
Hathom referred to consisted of
Ginny Dallarn, Wendy Miles,
Ann Shaughncssy, Jackson and
Britney Bates. Morgan Warner
was injured and did not play and
Paige Kilian is now a team man-
ager.

Generals for the second straight
game, keeping Hollins off the board.
Hathom especially cited the play
of the forward ling (Catherine
Baillie, Susan Moseley, and Ashley
Gray), and that of sophomores
Nancy Mitchell and Ashley Hurt,
but added that “absolutely everyone
that I put in [the game] played a
great game."

Despite the fine play, Hathom
still admits that the Generals still
have work to do. “We were all
over them and couldn't put the ball
in the goal."

Hathom feels that the next few
games should put the team's ability
to the test. “We still have a long
road ahead of us. Marymount and
Randolph-Macon (Ashland) will be
two very tough games.”

Next up for the Generals, 2-2-1,
2-1-1 in conference play, will be
road games at Marymount and
ODAC foe Randloph-Macon. The
Generals will next take to the
Liberty Hall ﬁelds on September 30
against North Carolina Wesleyan.

Last year, the Washington and
Lee volleyball team opened the
season by capturing the Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College
tournament.

The Generals defeated all comers
on their way to their second straight
title, coming up with wins over host
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College,
Sweet Briar, Mary

W&L fought through some tough
situations to win 9 of 10 games
played. The Generals’ only loss was
to Sweet Briar who took the first of
two games by a score of 15-11, but
the Generals team rallied for
revenge in the second, routing the
Vixens 15-2.

In the round robin tournament,
each team played two games against
each school. If the teams split the
two games, the tie-breaker would be
decided by the combined point
spread in the two games.

Mena McGowin, a stand-out
sophomore from Mobile, Ala., led
the team with an average of 2.5
kills per game. Leslie Hess was also
an effective hitter, killing balls at an
average of 1.9 per game. Lisa Jay,
the Generals’ captain, also had an

outstanding tournament, compiling
56 assists.
Said McGowin, “The team

showed a great effort hitting the ball
hard, and diving for a lot of balls
that I didn't think could possibly be
saved. We were down in some of
our games, but were able to come
together when we needed to.”

The Generals will be on the road
this weekend for the Bridgewater

' College Tournament, and will return

home on Thursday, September 28,
for games against Bridgewater and
Shenandoah in the Warner Center.

The Washington and Lee water
polo team returned triumphant from
their weekend trip to Boston,
winning the Northeastern Varsity

The Generals were lifted by fine

team had to overcome an inspired
MIT club playing at home.

All the classic elements for an
upset were there, but W&L
overcame the unfamiliar pool and
the partisan MIT crowd to escape
with a 10-8 win behind three goals
apiece from Strader, freshman Chris
Hagge, and junior Tomas Perez.

“The MIT game was the key,"
said Remillard. “Everyone wanted
to see them win, [but] we needed to
play with the cards we were dealt
with and we did it. We got
composure out of that game.”

After the semifinal win over
MIT, the finals seemed a bit anti-
climatic. The Generals nudged past
Villanova, upset winners over
Richmond, by a margin of 10-6.

“I'm very pleased with the
progress we’re making,” Remillard
said. “We’re playing so much as a
team. We don't have a standout

  

The l-?ing- tum Phi 

player. It would have been easy for
them to listen to their critics — [but]

we’re building something pretty
good.”

Nonetheless, there is still work
to be done in the eyes of the coach
and players. The team trailed at one
point in each of the weekend games
with the exception of Fordham, and
Remillard acknowledges that he
wants his team to improve its set

offense and become more proficient
in its supplementary defense.

Said co-captain Olson, “We're
pleased with the weekend results,
but at the same time we know we
need to play better in the future to
accomplish our goals — and we can
play better.”

Olson’s work in the goal has
been a major reason that the
Generals are undefeated after eight
games. Olson's work in goal, said
Remillard, “was definitely the best
in the toumament.”

This weekend, the team travels
to Fredericksburg for the Virginia
State Championships. The chief
competition for the Generals should
be the arch-rival Richmond Spiders.
The teams would meet in the finals,‘
a game that Remillard professes to
be “pessimistic” about. It should be
a match between W&L’s team
speed and balance; and Richmond’s
experience and individual talent.

Iler was voted All-Southcm

in 1936, he was the only unanimous
selection on the team. For his
efforts, Iler was later named an
All-American by the Helms Athletic
Foundation. He was also a
tliree-year standout for the W&L
baseball team and served as captain
of the team his senior year. He
helped the 1935 team to a record of

the most wins in one season for a
W&L baseball squad.

Gilbert (Gil) Bocettl, Jr. stands as
one of the most electrifying football
quarterbacks Washington and Lee

After starting the season at home
with a 5-3 victory against Denison,
the Washington and Lee men's
soccer team played three road
games this week, and lost each by a
2-1 score.

On Friday, the Generals headed
to Baltimore and played Johns
Hopkins (3-1) and Camegie—Mellon
(3-0) on astroturf in a weekend
tournament. On Tuesday the team
travelled to North Carolina and
took on Guilford (3-2).

In the first game, Hopkins led 2-

to keep the Generals close.

Neither team managed to score
during the second half, as Hopkins’
halftime lead proved to be the final
score.

Head coach Rolf Piranian
focused on the execution of the
game plan and the team’s intensity.
“We didn't play our game. We
played right into their strength by
trying to play in the air, and they
were much bigger than us.”

W&L maintain a 0-0 tie at the half.
Camegie—Mellon had a 2-0 lead in
the second half before freshman
midﬁelder Reid Murphy scored his
ﬁrst collegiate goal with about five
minutes remaining in the contest.

Piranian admitted that adjusting
to astroturf makes a slight
difference, but “that shouldn't have
affected us in terms of intensity.”
He also said that “this tournament
gave us a good reading of who our

and national prominence in both
sports.

Lichtfuss, a native of Towson,
Md. who now resides in Baltimore,
was W&L’s leading scorer in
basketball as a sophomore, a junior
and a senior, and he helped W&L
to the College Athletic Conference
basketball championship in 1971 and
1972. In addition, he led the
Generals in steals, assists and
rebounds in both his junior and
senior seasons. Lichtfuss, who
served as captain of the team during
the 1973-74 season, finished his
W&L career with 1,592 career
points to make him the fifth all-time
leading scorer in W&L history. He
was named an Honorable Mention
All-American after his senior year.

As a lacrosse player, Lichtfuss
helped W&L to an .877 winning
percentage over four years. Lichtfuss
was named a Second Team
All-America midﬁelder in 1972 and
was elevated to First Team

in Baltimore

Silva scored an unassisted goal to
put the Generals up 1-0. Midway
through the second half, Guilford
knotted the score at 1-1.

The match headed into overtime,
and Guilford scored the garne-

winning goal on diving header off
of a crossing pass ﬁve minutes into
the first overtime. W&L hammered
away at the Guilford goal for fifteen
minutes of the second overtime and
got off three solid shots.

Guilford’s defense held firm, and
the Generals headed back to
Lexington with a 2-1 overtime
defeat.

A disappointed Piranian said
after the loss, “We played far
below the intensity and skill level
expected for this team. It wasn’t a
proud day for our kids."

All-America status in both 1973 and
1974. ‘In those three years, W&L
compiled a 40-5 record, the best
three-year period in the school's
history. W&L participated in the
NCAA Division I National
Tournament the final three years
Lichtfuss played, and the Generals
reached the NCAA semiﬁnals in
both 1973 and 1974 and were
ranked as high as No. 2 in the
country in 1974. Lichtfuss was
chosen to represent W&L in the
annual North- South lacrosse game
in 1974.

Richard J. (Cap’n Dick) Smith,
long-time coach and athletic director
was the embodiment of the spirit of
athletics at W&L. A native of
Culpepper, Va.,’Cap’n Dick was a
member of the class of 1913 and
was an outstanding second baseman
and captain on the baseball team. It
was as a coach and administrator,
however, that Cap’n Dick made his
mark on W&L athletics. Cap’n Dick
became athletic director in 1921 and
remained in that post until his
retirement in 1954. He coached
baseball for 30 years from 1922-52,
during which his teams won one
Southern Conference championship
and several Virginia Big Six titles.
Cap’n Dick also coached the
basketball team from 1926-30, and
his teams posted a combined mark
of 32-6 from 1928-30.

Under Srnith’s leadership, W&L
developed one of the most
comprehensive intercollegiate and

intramural athletic programs in the

  

 

Southern Conference. He was also
one of the most inﬂuential figures
in the early history of the league,
and at the time of his retirement, he

was recognized as the dean of
Southern Conference athletic
directors.

A native of Jersey City, N.J.,

‘Domlnlck A. (Dom) Flora was a

dazzling four-year starter on W&L
basketball teams from 1954 through
1958. Known for his deadly
jump-shooting ability and his ﬂashy,
but crisp ball-handling skills, Flora
averaged 21 points per game over
his career at W&L. He finished his
career in Lexington with 2,310
points, the fifLh—highest point total
in college basketball at the time and
still the all-time mark at W&L.
Flora was a master at scoring, even
against defenses that were designed
specifically to stop him.

Flora, who graduated in 1958,
was named a first team All-America
by the Helms Athletic Foundation in
1958, a squad that included such
players as Elgin Baylor, Oscar
Robertson and Wilt Chamberlain.
He was named Player of the Year
in the Southern Conference and the
Virginia Big Six, and was named to
the Associated Press All-Southem
Conference team for two
consecutive years.

Flora, who makes his home in
Maplewood, N.J., was also a star on
the baseball diamond, where he
played shortstop as a freshman,
second base as a sophomore and
centerfield and pitcher as a junior
and senior.

must pull those strings tight.
The plan is simple. Bush appears
on television and tells the world we

reinstate that order if the hostages’
ﬂight to freedom is in any way hin-
dered or imperiled. If any hostages
are killed, targets on the Iranian
mainland will also be bombed.

If Iran does not budge, the bomb-
ers would strike as promised. Pilots
and planes would perhaps be lost.
After the bombing, the Iranians
would perhaps do nothing, or perhaps
allow a hostage to be killed or in
some other way fail to obey. In such
a case, the same scenario must be
repeated. The president armounces
another target, with the same 48-hour
deadline.

Eventually. Iran will have no
choice but to capitulate. Just like
Americans, some Iranians are willing
to die when C()ll'\‘IIlC€d their cause is
jUSl,"bll{‘ the Iranian leadership’ will
not continue to hand its- economic
life blood over to slaughter and to

48-hour deadline is designed to allow‘

become increasingly likely.

Such a policy would succeed. But "
implementation would require a de—:
gree of courage, commitment and'»’
leadership we have not seen from"
Bush. And the power of today’s
Neville Cliamberlains, those who in-’’
sist on efforts to appease so--called ’
moderates in Iran and seek to strike
only those who personally hold the ’
hostages, is insurance that the night-
mare will continue.

And so, even after the image nt 5
the noose has faded from the screen,"
scoundrcls still have their way, and’,
the body still hangs liinply. And the
shame will keep on mounting, until
America comes to understand that
loss of life is at times the price of
security, liberty and honor. T':e status
quo guarantees the seizure of more -'
innocents and the continuing ens1ave- .
ment of us all. ‘
