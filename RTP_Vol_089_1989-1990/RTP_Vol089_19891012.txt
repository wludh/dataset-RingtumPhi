 WiIson calls W&L’s fraternities ‘vitally important’

By Brian Root
Senior Copy Editor

The Fraternity Renaissance
program, in which Washington and
Lee will spend about $10 million to
renovate many of the 16 fraternity
houses, is intended to preserve
W&L’s fraternities, not to eliminate
them, said W&L President John D.

Wilson in a speech at Tuesday
night ’ s lnterfratemity Council
meeting.

“The fraternities at W&L are,

use to be
examined

By Cathy Lopiccolo
Staff Reporter

The Health Education Committee
will be sponsoring a series of events
next week to mark National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week,
according to W&L senior Nancy
Hickam, co-chairman of the
Committee.

“(We want) to get people to be
aware of the effects of alcohol and
how much they drink,” Hickarn
said. “A lot of people don't realize
they have a problem with alcohol or
how much they depend on it.”

The first event planned by the
committee is a banner contest on

the weeks theme of “Absolut
Awareness," taken from the brand
of liquor,‘ said senior Carter
Montague, the committee’s other
cliaiiman. The residence halls will
be making the banners for

“The banners are supposed to be
done on this Friday and judged. The
winning hall gets an ice cream party
or a pizza party, and their banner
will be hung somewhere on campus
during next week,” Hickam said.

who served as Deputy Chief of
Staff under former President Ronald
Reagan, will speak in Lee Chapel.

institutions,” said Wilson. “This
school has a lot of conﬁdence and a
lot at stake in the leadership the
fraternities provide.”

The only setback for the
program thus far, Wilson said, are
cost overruns.

“We had been hoping to keep
the renovation within our original
cost estimates,” Wilson said.
“Unfortunately, the first four houses
are running about 30 percent over
cost.”

The current poor quality of the
houses is related to what Wilson
called “the general decline of the
fraternity movement." Since the late

so the general quality of fraternity

“In the last few years, however,

SAB rules revised;

BGCOUHIS

By Brooke Jzirabek
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee has
revised the ﬁnancial procedures of
the Student Activities Board after
the SAB amassed a $26,000 deficit
for fiscal year 1988-1989.

To do this, the EC broke the
SAB budget into two parts instead
of giving the SAB one lump sum as
it had in the past. The Fancy Dress
Ball fund has been separated from
the SAB general fund. The general

’ fund of S40,0()0 was further sepa-

rated iiito funds for Fall ($15,000),
Winter (Sl5,()l)()), and Spring
(Sl(),()(l0).

The EC also eliminated all SAB
charge accounts. All SAB pur-
chases must now go through the
Business Office. The SAB will
have to get a check from the Busi-
ness Olifiec for a predetermined
amount of money and then cash it
in order to purchase ice, cups and
any other supplies.

“This will prevent charges from

closed

coming in late and prevent not giv- ,

ing an accurate account of where
money has been spent," according
to EC President Willard Dumas.
He said the new procedure will give
the EC a more accurate account of
expenditures as well as “requiring
SAB to plan and organize better."
“The SAB considered it a personal
attack when [the EC] cut their bud-
get, but the budgets of all the other
campus organizations were also
cut,” Dumas said.

The number of organizations to
which the EC goves funds has in-
creased from about 5 or 6 two years
ago to about 25 this year, said Du-
mas. The student activities fee that
each student pays yearly to provide
funds for these student groups has
increased by only $5 in that time.

Dumas said the EC will seek the
approval of the Board of Trustees to
increase the yearly student activity
fee by at least $10. “If we don't
raise the fee,” he said, “we'll be in
the same position next year."

Hitz will chair Fancy Dress

Accepts higher position after last week's resignation

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed Alex Hitz as the new Fancy
Dress chairman less than a week
after Hit’/. resigned as Fancy Dress
vice chairman. Will Jones, who had
not applied for a position on the
Fancy Dress committee in the first
interviews, was named the new vice
chairinini.

Hitz resigned from his position
as vice chair after Richard Spence
was appointed chairman. Spence
also resigned from his position say-
ing the SAB was willing to cooper-
ate with him only if he played by
their rules. He could not accept
their rules and quit because, he said,

. .:.«

his hands “were tied from the
start.”

Hitz, who had applied for the
position of chairman while Spence
had applied for the position of audi-
tor, resigned because he believed he
was more qualiﬁed to be Fancy
Dress Chairman then Spence, al-
though Spence had similar organiza-
tional experiences in high school.
Hitz also said he would accept a
position other than chairman only if
he could work with the chairman.

EC President Willard Dumas
said Hitz was the only applicant for
the position because "the job has
gotten so big it scares students
away." '

After Spence resigned, declaring
the SAB would not cooperate with

him, Dumas said "the picture was
painted throughout the student body
that a lot of people on the SAB and
a lot of people in school have set
notions as to how the job of chair-
man is to be run and what is ex-
pected."

He added students may think
"those people aren't willing to bend
those expectations, so a lot of stu-
dents don’t want to come into a po-
sition" where the supporting people
refuse to change their ideas.

Dumas said the EC is attempting
to change the chairrnan’s job de-
scription and encourage the three
officers to share the burden because
the responsibility is too big for one
person to handle alone.

students has risen back to about 90
percent, and the old attitude about
fraternities has begun to change.

“You students have inherited a
system that’s been in decline for
almost 20 years,” Wilson said.
“Frankly, the shape of your houses
reflects that, but you are the people
who can change it.”

Wilson assured the fraternities
the school is committed to insuring
the fraternities’ survival, through the
renovation program.

“Fraternities have been
since before the Civil War,”

Wilson. “I think we can agree that

let them slip away.”
Wilson said many other colleges,

such as Williams College and
Amherst College, reacted to
mounting liability problems with
fraternities by simply eliminating
them. ‘

Other colleges, such as
Dartmouth, imposed tight new
restrictions on fraternities without

offering to help the houses attain
them, thus effectively sentencing the
houses to extinction, Wilson said.
“It was almost as if they were
hoping the fraternities would fail,”
Wilson said. “But here, the
students, alumni, trustees, and even

Walsh

most of the faculty have said
fraternities are too important to let
them go by the wayside.”

The goals of the program go far

beyond simply rebuilding the
houses, Wilson said.
“Fraternities were once

considered homes where one could
select the people he could work
with, party with, and grow to
maturity with,” said Wilson. “Now,
they’re seen as just a party pavilion.
We're hoping to see that change."

The renovation program is set to
begin this summer, when work will
begin on four houses.

tapped

for A.D. post

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

Wednesday afternoon, Washing-
ton and Lee announced that Michael
Walsh will become the school’s

next athletic director effective Dec.‘

1.

“l was impressed with every-
thing I saw when I came down to
visit,” said Walsh. “I got the im-
pression that the athletic program
was healthy. I was impressed with
the professionalism and enthusiasm
that the coaches showed toward
both their teams and their teaching
jobs.”

Walsh becomes the fifth athletic
director in W&L’s history. He re-
places William McHenry, who re-
signed over the summer.

Walsh comes to W&L from
Dartmouth College, where he served
as head baseball coach and assistant
athletic director since 1981.

Said Walsh, “I’m very excited,
and my family is very excited about
coming to Lexington."

Said W&L president John Wil-
son, “We are delighted that Mr.
Walsh and his family have accepted
our offer to join the Washington
and Lee community. We look for-
w.ii'd to his leadership, gained
through his years of experience as a
coach and an administrator.

“He comes from an Ivy League

school with the balance of academ-
ics and athletics in the proper pro-
spective. He understands otir situa-
tion and will be able to provide us
with fresh views that someone from
outside the community can bring."

His specific duties at Dartmouth
centered around event management,
budgeting, marketing and NCAA
compliance. Walsh, 41, was also
part of a management team that iri-
stituted a five-year plan for improv-
ing the quality of Dartmouth‘s com-
petitive sports program. Within four
years, the plan produced Dart-
month's best won-lost record in 27
years.

Smith: debt paid for image

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Although bills are still being
paid for last year’s Fancy Dress, the
improved ‘image’ of the Student
Activities Board is worth it, accord-
ing to 1989 Fancy Dress Chairman
Liz Smith.

“We knew image of it — how
the students perceived SAB -— was
the most important thing to get back
on track and then you can correct
the money problems when people
are willing to pay the money," said
Smith.

Last year was an interim period
for the student organization, accord-
ing to Smith, and was “definitcly"
worth the resulting budgetary prob-
lerns.

“We knew it was going to take
a year, maybe two, to get the stu-
dents psyched to go to an SAB
function," said Smith.

The financial headaches of last
year’s Fancy Dress stemmed from
the Thursday night B.B. King con-
cert, which
loss.

“We had a huge name for

incurred a substantial

ock

The Connells played the Pavilion Friday night of

Thursday night and you just can’t
support that," said Smith.

No records exist, however, of
exactly how much money was lost
since the receipts for Thursday
night’s ticket sales and tickets for
Friday’s ball were never separated.

Smith said the Friday night
Fancy Dress Ball initially made
money for the SAB. This was true
originally, according to a budget
report sent to the Executive Com-
mittee immediately after Fancy
Dress. That report showed receipts
approximately $2,000 over costs.
That figure, however, failed to con-
sider bills yet to come in, said
Smith.

Incoming Fancy Dress bills con-
tinue to create pressures for this
year’s SAB. The latest bill — more
than $800 from Rose's — arrived
just this past Tuesday, according to
this year’s SAB. Treasurer Katie
Duwel.

“Even to this day, we don't
know what was actually spent be-
cause we don’t know what bills are
yet to come in,” said Duwel.

The unorganized handling of
money was the biggest problem

with last year’s SAB, according to
Smith.

“We had so much money going
through our hands last year, more
than we had ever, because we
brought in more money. We had
bigger entertainment and bigger bud-
gets,” said Smith.

Smith blames last year’s SAB
treasurer Mike Carroll for not keep-
ing accurate records of the charges
and future bills. “There should
have been a ledger kept, but we've
been looking and we can't find it,”
said Smith.

Smith says she handed the bills
to Carroll and expected him to keep
the records.

“The treasurer is supposed to be
on top of things...I had a million
other things to do,” said Smith.
Smith said her requests for a sepa-
rate FD account were tumed down
both last year and the year before.

“What the FD chairman needs is
a secretary. Perhaps the
establishment of a Fancy Dress au-
ditor this year will help," said
Smith.

  OPINION

Lexington tries .

a new tax dance

The personal property tax in the city of Lexington is 5.5
percent. To put it in more graphic terms, if a Washington
and Lee student were made to pay this tax on a brand-new
BMW 325i convertible, the bill would come to $1,950.

Lexington is, as its leaders like to say, “financially
stressed.” Because the city is restricted from expanding,
Lexington has few ways to expand its tax income. Thus was
born the notion to tax student cars. After all, don't students
park their cars here nine months out of each year? Don't
they use city streets and take advantage of city services? 30
they should pay the same tax as year—round residents, right.‘

Wrong.

The reason is simple. It's not legal. The issue hinges on
the distinction between in-state and out—of-state students. For

out—of-state students who pay property taxes back home,s

there seems to be no question. Section 58.1-3511 of the state
code says, “Any person domiciled in another state whose
motor vehicle is principally parked in this Commonwealth
during the tax year shall not be subject to a personal
property tax on such vehicle upon showing of sufficient
evidence that such person has paid a personal property tax
on the vehicle in the state in which he is domiciled.” The
statute goes on to say that a “similar tax” in the car
owner’s home state will make him exempt.

In the next paragraph, the law says someone who has paid
a personal property tax in Virginia and a “similar tax” in
his home state “may apply to such city or county for a
refund of such tax payment.” I ,

Lexington City Manager Joseph King, in a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi, said, in his opinion, that meant students could
be made to pay the difference between Lexington’s tax rate
and that of the student's home state. l

That assessment, we believe, is faulty. Every state, as well
as the federal government, provides for refunds of excess tax
payments. Accidents happen. Every year, many people pay
taxes for which they are not obligated. If such cases, they
can apply for a refund of the unnecessary payment. i‘

That appears to be the case here. If a student were to pay
an urmecessary tax to the city of Lexington, the law provides
him with a means to get a refund, not the city with a means
to tax students twice for the same property. I

Although the law does not seem to address in-state
students, we believe the doctrine of fairness obligates the
city to exempt in-state students from the personal property
tax as well. Is it fair to subject in-state students to what
amounts to two personal property taxes? Lexington’s rate is
the highest in the state, so every in-state student would pay
at least a fraction of that 5.5 percent. Also, is it fair to tax
in-state students while those students who have, by accident
of birth, escaped Virginia residency are exempted?

King said Lexington is waiting for the city attorney to
deliver an opinion on the matter. There is no need to wait.
The law is clear. Lexington will have to look elsewhere.

Lee remembered

One century and nineteen years ago this morning, Gen.
Robert E. Lee, then the president of this college, died. He
was remembered earlier today in a memorial service in the
chapel that bears his name.

During President George Bush's visit to Charlottesville last
month, the then—president of the University of Virginia,
Robert O'Neill, pointed out that Thomas Jefferson is
mentioned at least every two hours on the UVa campus.
“There are worse habits,” he observed.

The same is perhaps often said of Lee here: Why must we
praise him constantly? Weren’t their two founders? And
didn’t anyone else do anything for W&L?

The answer, of course, is yes. But there is a reason why
we remember Lee so fondly and so often. Perhaps Maj. John
W. Daniel explained it best, when he spoke at the unveiling
ceremony for the statue that rests in Lee Chapel:

Here for ﬁve years the General devoted himself to the
cause of education, and here under him that cause nobly
ﬂourished. Here he demonstrated that comprehensive grasp of
every subject connected with his sphere; and the keen
apprehension of the demands of this progressive age, and of
a land entering as it were upon a new birth. His associates in
the faculty loved him as a father, and all who saw or knew
his work with common voice proclaimed the conviction
expressed by one of the most distinguished of his associates,
that he was ”the best College President that this country has
ever produced."

Lee. General, educator, gentleman. Remember him. There
are worse habits. I

Students accuse EC of budget bias}.

MY VIEW

By Gary McCullough
and Aelica Ingenthron

What is the purpose of a stu-
dent—run Executive Committee? If
there is any point in having such a
committee at a liberal arts school,
then it seems logical that such a
committee would promote the same
kind of atmosphere that is condu-
cive to a liberal arts education - an
education which, under ideal circ-
urnstances, promotes an open ex-
change of ideas for the benefit of
none other than those who have the
courage to exchange them. So, con-
sidering the importance of such a
committee, if there is any doubt as
to whether the committee is per-
forming to the best of its capabili-
ties, then such a doubt must be ad-
dressed immediately. For, if the
committee fails to do this then it
betrays not only itself, but the stu-

organization"? The impression
which I gathered from their com-
ments was that a political organiza-
tion is anything which “personally
offen " any one of the EC’s mem-
bers. Rest assured that if I were a
member of the EC and had the right
to make my decision in the same
manner, then the Liberty Hall Vol-
unteers sure as hell wouldn't have
received $900 which they were allo-
cated for the year. After all, I
would have made my decision pure-
ly on that which I found offensive.
And what could be more‘ offensive
than a group of southern college
students marching around in Con-
federate uniforms? Didn't the Mi-
nority Student Association boycott

Fancy Dress two years ago on the
basis that the same theme had’ racist
cormotations?

The point of this is not to attack
the Liberty Hall Volunteers, but to
attack the principle by which The
EC denied Amnesty International, a
committee which is designed to pro-
mote human rights, their fair share
of the EC’s central funding. I, per-
sonally, would have rather seen that
$900 go toward saving prisoners of
conscience. However, my opinion
does not count - not because my
opinion is not important, but appar-
ently because I am not a member of
the EC. Even the W&L student
handbook classiﬁes Amnesty Inter-
national separately from the political

organizations.

One might assume that bias is,
entering into my interpretation of
the EC’s decision-making process. '

However, I am basing my argu— I
ment solely on what I was told at
the meeting, which can be summekii
up well by EC Rep. David Antho- ‘
ny, who said, “I personally find
your organization offensive." 'Well, 0
all I have to say to that person is
that I find YOUR organization quite '
offensive. But who cares what ei- I
ther of us think? - the point is that
the student body has to live with ’
what he thinks, not with what It
think. Even the United States
government has a system of checks ‘
and balances. Think about that! ' ,.

women being offended by the theme. It was
just that — a theme!

Secondly, responding to last week's car-
toon depicting a W&L guy dressed up as a
W&L girl for Homecoming Queen: I don't
understand why W&L women winning Home-
coming Queen should create a fuss. It should
be that way. A Hollins/Sweetbriar, etc. girl
winning W&L Homecoming Queen is like an
Australian girl winning Miss America because
"she speaks English and visits America a lot."

complaint to the Executive Committee for what

behavior on. the part of both individuals on the

would imagine, following so disastrous an
interview, that there were many that probably
did not even read my application with any
particular care. This is a practice which defeats
the entire purpose of the written application.

As well, this procedure shows great
disrespect to the applicant and, quite frankly,
an incredible amount of gall on the part of the
members of the EC to assume any position of
authority in the decision-making process, given
the unpreparedness of the committee members
and the inequity with which the applicant was
treated. For this procedure does not take into
account the confidence and eloquence so well
expressed on paper but lost in the transition to
speech in front of a panel of thirteen members
by a nervous applicant to a position that does
not require such eloquence in speech.

My second complaint is to an individual on
the EC, second-year law Rep. Mark Cobb. It is
directed at a question asked of me by Mr.
Cobb after my formal dismissal from the
interview by Mr. Dumas. It was a question
that, so phrased and so timed," could do
nothing but to further the detriment of my
interview.

is SAB lying?’

Last week I paused over two words that
appeared in Richard Spence's editorial on his
SAB experience. The words were “creative
bookkeeping" quoted from Alexander Hitz.
What does this mean? According to Spence,
they represent “fraud, mismanagement, and 
lies.”

If what Spence asserts is true, have
members of the SAB breached the Honor
System? To my knowledge, the White Book
does not address the question of how one
maintains his finances.

Is it any wonder that the Hill has been
curtailing student responsibility with examples
like the SAB?

Let's hope that the SAB has answers for
the accusations made by Richard Spence.

which brings them together. ,

One of the problems which can
occur within such a committee is '
the presence of bias. For if bias is ,
present, the committee is not objec-

objective, then it is not a committee ,
which represents the student body —
but one which represents only the 9

mind, that just because a committee ’

Students affected
by Hurricane Hugo

By Kelley McCabe
Staff Reporter

Shortly after hurricane Hugo
crashed through South Carolina,
W&L senior Mary Hipp left school
to survey the damage done to her
home on Pawley’s Island, just south
of Myrtle Beach.

Hipp found that although Hugo
broke only a window of the main
house where her family resides part
time, the separate house where Hipp
resides was levelled.

To help Hipp and others who
suffered injuries and property
damages during the storm that
passed through South Carolina three
weeks ago, food, cleaning supplies
and other necessities were shipped
to the area from all over the nation
by groups like the Salvation Army.
“Stuff was coming in from

Volunteers

By Tracey Thornblade
Staff Reporter

Have you ever wondered why a
bunch of Washington and Lee
students would be marching around
in uniform on a chilly Sunday
afternoon? The answer is that these
men are the Liberty Hall Volunteers,
who held a memorial service for
Gen. Robert E. Lee today at noon

in Lee Chapel.
The group was originally
founded in 1861 at Washington

College by Prof. James White to
ﬁght in the Civil War. The band of
73 men, 57 of them students at the
college, participated in every battle,
"march and encampment which Gen.
Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson
commanded from May 1861 to
Lee’s surrender at Appomattox in
April 1865.

Two Washington and Lee
students re—forrned the group in
1987 to preserve the historical

Alpha Phi Omega, W&L’s
service fraternity, was one of the
many groups who sponsored a drive
for the survivor's of Hugo. The
drive was organized by Lexington
resident Mirabai McLeod.

McLeod initially tried to donate
goods through the Red Cross, but
when she discovered the Red Cross
was not participating in a relief
program, she decided to organize
one on her own.

McLeod said she publicized the
drive through newspaper notices and
radio blurbs in the Lexington area.
Alpha Phi Omega also posted signs
around campus.

Although only two boxes of
goods were collected from W&L,
McLeod said concerned individuals
from the area donated many
cleaning supplies, non-perishable
food items, and baby food. VMI

Kent Gregory, the current

“For other groups it's only a

Gregory also stressed that the
group is not sectional. although the
volunteers represent members of the
Confederate militia. In fact, many of
the volunteers are from the North.

Throughout the year, the Liberty

According to Montague, Deaver’s
talk is titled “Alcoholism: One
Man’s Battle.”

The movie Clean and Sober,
starring Michael Keaton, will be
shown Tuesday night in Gaines
Residence Hall, Hickam said.

Also on Wednesday afternoon,

there will be another speaker,
Marilyn Clayton, from the
Lexington Treatment Center, said
.Hickam.

.The SAB is helping the

committee sponsor a reggae band in
the General Headquarters restaurant
Wednesday night. According to
Hickam the Pit will not serve
alcohol that night.

Although there are no planned

Hickam said the Health Education
Committee has asked..all .professors

The final activity is a Battle of
the Bands at the Pavilion. Campus
bands will compete for a $5(X) first
place prize and a $250 second place
pnze.

“We're going to judge the bands
on the yelling and applause of the
crowd. So hopefully the bands will
bring all their friends to clap for
them," Hickam said.

The committee is also conducting
a survey,

' “We’re trying to become aware
of what alcohol problems there are
on campus,” Hickam said. “The
display areas will have information
about alcohol and drinking laws that
people can pick up."

“It’s very hard to educate people
on campus about alcohol and its
effects," said Hickam. “We're
trying to do it in a fun way."

This morning at 9:30 the bells of
Lee Chapel tolled nineteen times to

noon, the volunteers marched from
Washington Hall to Lee Chapel for
the memorial service. Capt. Robert
Peniston, the chapel curator, made
opening remarks. Afterwards, Prof.
Taylor Sanders gave a speech on
Lee's life, followed by a reading of
the death scene from a Lee

was played. The service ended with I

BUDGET

from page 1

tions that are allocated funds by the
EC for the 1988-89 ﬁscal year is
$32,000. The previous year showed
a surplus of $20,000, according to
Assistant Controller Don Holt.

All surplus money at the end of
the ﬁscal year is placed into a stu-
dent reserve fund. Because the
money to pay for last year's deﬁcit
came from the reserve fund, the
fund was depleted to $l,(X)0.

University President John Wilson
granted the EC a one-time gift of
$15,0()0 this year to help the student
organizations with their finances.

Other changes the SAB has
made to help meet the budget in-
clude a concert checklist, which was
used in planning and organizing
Homecoming, and job descriptions.
The job descriptions provide a writ-
ten rather than verbal breakdown of
individual member's duties.

TALKBACK

"The people [there] were very
happy," said McLeod.

Chisolm Coleman, a sophomore
from Charleston, said that he saw
the relief arrive in a rather unusual
form. Because area water and
sewer systems were damaged by
Hugo, the Miller Beer Company
delivered four truck loads of twelve-

Homecoming win puts Generals on track for best season in

—

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

People say that everything runs
in cycles.

If that is true, Washington and
Lee football faithful hope that the
cycle is true every ﬁve years.

It was ﬁve years ago when
W&L won it’s last Homecoming
football game, ironically against
Maryville. In that game, W&L
played a rather slow ﬁrst half
before exploding for 35 second half
points on the way to a 42-17 win.
The next week, W&L played at
Hampden-Sydney for the Tiger's
Homecoming game, in which the
Generals prevailed 32-20. Next
week, the Generals will travel to
Harnpden-Sydney. Is this the second
coming of 1985?

“I hope that 1985 turns into
1989,” said W&L head coach Gary
Fallon. “It’s nice to talk about, but
it’s got to be done in the present.
Our main concern is to stop them
from doing what they do and for us
to do what we do, and to come
home with a victory. That’s what
we’re going over there for.”

On Saturday, the Generals
played a relatively uneventful first
half, cautiously cruising out to a 10-
3 halftime lead.

The Generals received the
opening kickoff before the
Homecoming crowd of 5,005, and
junior kick returrier/slot back Carl
Gilbert almost gave the crowd a lot
to cheer about early. After ﬁelding
the kick off the ground, Gilbert
disappeared into a crowd, and then
appeared up the far sideline, and
was knocked out of bounds at the
W&L 49-yard line after a 29-yard
retum. -

From there, junior tailback
Mason Pope went to work. Three
straight carries got the Generals a
ﬁrst down, most of the yards

coming on second effort. Pope then
caught a pass from senior
quarterback Phillip Sampson for a
gain of 14 more.

After two more rims netted the
junior 14 yards, the Generals were
on the Maryville 15-yard line.
Senior Scott Jackson took an inside
handoff from Sampson and got
down to the six, where Pope
proceeded to barrel through the left
side into the end zone for a 7-0
W&L lead.

After Maryville was forced to
punt on its next drive, Sampson
made his only mistake of the game.
On second down from the W&L 34,
he tried to throw a middle screen,
but Maryville nose guard Jess
Massengill intercepted the W&L
signal caller. It was only Sampson’s
second interception of the year.

The Scots kept the ball on the
ground, and their drive stalled when
fullback Zack Blanton was stopped
on third down at the W&L six.
Maryville settled for a 23-yard ﬁeld
goal from Scott Porter to make the
score 7-3 at the end of the first
quarter. '

When the Generals initial drive
of the second stanza stalled and
Pope had to punt, Maryville
returned Sampson’s early gift. On,
their first play, in almost the exact
place on the field as Sampson<’s
interception, tailback Keith
Washington fumbled going into the
line when he was hit by senior
linebacker Mike Pack, and
sophomore nose guard Greg Kiehl
recovered for W&L.

Sampson worked the Generals
down to the Maryville eight,_ and
Pope got five yards to the three.
Then head coach Gary -Fallon
reached into his bag of tricks for
the halfback pass, Gilbert corralled
Pope's pass just out of the back of
the end zone. Pope lost a yard on
third down, and Quayle was called

WALSH

from page 1

Said W&L interim athletic direc-
tor Richard Miller, “I think
[Walsh’s] basic experience in a situ-
ation similar. to ours at Dartmouth,
even though Dartmouth is Division
I-A, is not so far removed from
what we are dealing with here.
That, I think, is the greatest thing
he brings to us.”

As baseball coach, Wals is
credited with turning the program at
Dartmouth around. In 1981 Walsh
took over a losing team, and in
1987 led the Big Green to a 24-14
record, the Ivy League title and the
No. 1 ranking in New England and
a spot in the NCAA Division I
baseball championships.

Walsh, a member of the NCAA
Division I Baseball steering comrnit—
tee, was a finalist for national Divi-
sion I Coach-of-the-Year honors in
1987. He was named the 1987
Northeast and New England Coach-
of-the-Year. Walsh currently serves
on the Executive board of the New
England Intercollegiate Baseball
Coaches Association.

Walsh graduated from the Uni-
versity of Massachusetts at Amherst
in 1971. He attended Albany Law
School from 1971 to 1972 and has
done graduate work in sports

administration at his alma mater in
1975.

Before coming to Dartmouth,
Walsh served as head baseball and
basketball coach and admissions and
financial aid officer for the North-
field Mount Hermon School, the
nation's largest co-educational inde-
pendent school.

Said Wilson, “Michael is gentle-
man from a ﬁne family with high
values. He has good character and
will be a positive inﬂuence on all
of our lives.”

Walsh's first duty at W&L will
be to name the new head men‘s la-
crosse coach.

On the lacrosse program, Walsh

said, “Things tend to go in cycles,
and lacrosse is not quite up where
we would like them to be. Our goal
is to get the program back up to
par.”
Said Walsh, “W&L is a highly
competitive, well-rounded university
with a proper balance between ath-
letics and academics. This is Divi-
sion III, and I'm comfortable with
the situation. It is similar to Dart-
mouth, and each school has it’s
unique problems. We’Il delve into
any problems we find here and do
our best to solve them.”

Junior Craig Irons runs down the sideline after catching Phillip Sampson's
pass. The play was good for 80 yards and the Generals defeated
Maryville 26-10. W&L file photo by W. Patrick Hinely.

Sampson dropped back and looked
down the left sideline for junior
split end Craig Irons. Irons made a
leaping catch as two Maryvill:
defenders collided and fell down at
the W&L 40.

Irons had clear sailing down the

sideline for what would have been a
91-yard touchdown, but he stumbled
at the Maryville 20 and was pushed
out of bounds at the 10. The 80-
yard completion brought the crowd
to its feet, and put life into
relatively complacent W&L team.
The drive stalled as Sampson
was sacked, and the Generals settled
for Quaylc’s second ﬁeld goal of
the day, from 32 yards out to take a

13-3 lead. The rest of the third‘

quarter was uneventful, and W&L
had to punt as their ﬁrst drive of
the ﬁnal period stalled at their own
34. .

The Scots took over on their
own 42 with backup quarterback
Mike Wimpee, a passing specialist
in the game. On his ﬁrst'pass, he
was incomplete. On his second pass,
he was complete, but to the wrong
team. Junior safety Brad Miller read
the pass and picked it off at the 42
in front of the Scots’ bench. Miller
ran unrnolested down the sideline to
the ﬁve, ran over three Scots
would-be-tacklers into the end zone
for the touchdown and a 20-3 lead.
It was Miller’s second interception
of the year.

Miller’s retum broke the game
open, for on W&L’s next
possession, against what looked like
a beaten Maryville team, Sampson
set yet another record. On second
down from the Maryville 28,
Sampson faked a handoff to Crosby
and found a wide open Irons for a
touchdown. It was the senior’s 28th
career touchdown pass, breaking the
old record held by Jack Berry.
Quaylc’s kick was no good, and the
Generals led 26-3.

The Generals defense, which had
played very well, gave up a token
touchdown late in the game making
the ﬁnal score 26-10. Pack led the
defense with 15 tackles. Miller
made 14 tackles, three for losses.
Kiehl had eight tackles and a sack,

It proved to be the winner, but
the Generals got some insurance
from freshman Andrea Cardamone,
who scored unassisted with eighteen
minutes left to play.

W&L’s dominance was reﬂected
in the shot totals, where W&L
outshot R-MWC 27-2. Junior goalie
Sherri Brown recorded her fourth
shutout of the year.

Head coach Jan Hathom was

a

pleased with what she called a,
“great game.” She was especially
pleased with the play of senior‘
Catherine Baillio. ,-
The Generals found the going-a

Monday. After two halves ﬁnd an

The Ring-tum Phi, October 12, 1989

 

By Jay Plotkin
Sports Editor

They say records were made

‘to be broken, and so far this

football season, many a record
' has fallen by the wayside.

In every game he has played
this season, Washington and Lee
senior quarterback Phillip

I Sampson has either tied or
broken a W&L school record or
passed a career milestone. For
his accomplishments, Sampson
has been named The Ring-tum

Phi Athlete-of-the-Month for
September.
In W&L’s first game,

Sampson shattered the record for
passes’ completed in one game,
previously held by Jon Thornton
at 24. Sampson finished the day
with 34 completions. In game
two Sampson threw four
touchdown passes to tie the

.record held by Thornton, Steve
Fluharty, and Jack Berry.

4 Against Centre in the season’s

- third week, no records fell, but
on his first completion, Sampson

, went over the 3,0()0-yard passing

;. marker for his career.

‘ In week four, Sampson’s 311

. yards passing broke the record

‘ for passing yardage in a single

,1. game fell, previously held by
Fluharty, and last week, against
Maryville, Sampson took over ,
the lead in touchdown passes for
a career with 28. Berry held the
old mark of 27.

i For the season, Sampson has
a remarkable 89 completions in
131 attempts with just two
interceptions for 1,057 yards and
10 touchdowns. His passing
efficiency rating is an astounding

;._ 157.8, good enough to place him

third in the nation. An average

 

i

 
 

ATHLETE-OF-THE-MONTH

  

efficiency rating is 100.

On his current pace,
Sampson could break every
W&L record a quarterback could
hold except passing attempts.

Upon returning to school this
fall, Sampson had an idea of
how close he was to some of
the records, but “during the
games, though, none of us think
about what kinds of records we
may be breaking or what kind of

f e a t s w e m a y b e
accomplishing.”

What makes Sampson's
season even more remarkable

was that he spent the summer in
London. “I was able to throw
the ball some, but there weren’t
really any good weight rooms
where I could work out.”
Sampson is also quick to
point out that he could not put
up the numbers he has this year

llllp Sampson i tion. W fil p by .

ea .
Patrick Hinely.

without help from some rather
large friends. “People always
say that the offensive line
doesn't get any credit, but our
offensive line has really played
out of its head this year. We
lost a couple of really good
offensive linemen last year, and
this year we didn't know where
we would stand, but these guys
are just playing great.

“It's the same with Russ.
He’s hardly carried the ball this
year, but he's just a part of any
record the team might set as
anyone is.“

The offensive line consists of
senior Rich Poli, juniors Rob
Christensen, MIke DeMelfi, Rob
Robertson, and Frank Sudell and
sophomores Jim Henry and Rob
Thomas.

Aside from being the
Generals starting quznterback in

    

Sampson rewriting recor book

the fall, Sampson is also an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Pole Vault champion on the
track team.

On the field, the 6-2, 195-
pound senior out of St. John’s
High School in Houston, Texas
is having an All-American
season. Off the field, Sampson
would just as soon spend a quiet
day out in the country with
some friends as anything else.
“I like to spend time out in the
country at some of my friends
country houses. I have a bike
that I enjoy riding. I like
hanging out at the fraternity
house. I’m just a regular old
guy,” said Sampson.

After graduation, Sampson is
unsure of what he plans on
doing. “I’m thinking about
getting a job back in Houston,”
said Sampson. “But if I can’.t
find the kind of job I want this
Christmas, then I’ll probably end
up going to law school.”

Sampson said his career here
at W&L both on and off the
ﬁeld has had many memorable
moments, and he has had his
share of the good and the bad.
“I can think of some pretty
memorable bad things that have
happened to me, but I’ve had
tons of great things happen as
well, things that have meant a
lot to me. One thing that will
always stand out for me was our
game at Bridgewater last year. It
was a huge win, and I think
everyone who was on that
football team will remember that
forever.”

Congratulations to Phillip
Sampson, The Ring-tum Phi’s
Athlete-of-the-Month for
September.

, It has been the long and winding
road that has hurt the Washington
' and Lee men‘s soccer team.
,, The Generals proved how tough
.they are at home when they
{entertained the best team in the
v South Region last Saturday.
, On Saturday, the Mary
‘.Washington soccer machine rolled
“into Lexington with a 9-1 record.
The Eagles were ranked seventh in
4 the Division HI national polls, No.
'1 in the South Region, and had won
-eight straight games. In their past
9,13 home games, the Eagles had not
been scored upon.

On the road in Lexington was a
“different story, though. The Generals
‘fare unbeaten on the Liberty Hall
“Field, and freshman Mike Mitchem
jggnade it evident early on that W&L
{would not be intimidated.

 Mitchem scored early in the first
"_half to give W&L a 1-0 lead which
_';held until late in the game. Junior
pylon Bull again had a tremendous

game, keeping the Eagles off the
"board until late in the game.

 

Mary Washington evened the

score near the end of the match
with a ‘penalty kick.

With ten minutes gone in the

game, the Generals were scrambling
for the ball in front of the Eagles’
net. A lot of bodies hit the ground,
and while the Mary Washington
players screamed for a dangerous
play, Mitchem poked the ball into
the goal.

W&L nearly increased its slim

lead at 17:56 of the first half when
sophomore Jeff Zieger clanked the
ball off the right post with a shot
from the right wing.

Although Mary Washington had

just one shot on goal in the first
half, they kept Bull busy in the
second half. With constant offensive
pressure, the Eagles got off a point-
blank shot, and sent several headers
just over the crossbar.

8

W&L’s defense refused to fold,
nd it appeared that the Generals

were about to pick up their fourth
straight victory.

However, with 15:10 remaining

Zieger drew a whistle for tripping at
the top left edge of the penalty box.

an indirect kick for the opposing
team. Yet, Mary Washington was
awarded a penalty kick. The Eagles
then tied the score as their penalty
shot to the right side beat a diving

Bullf

For the next

15 minutes the

game seemed destined to head into
overtime as neither team mounted a
serious offensive threat. Then, with

just under 10 seconds remaining

in

the match, it looked as though Mary
Washington would emerge with the

win.
An Eagle forward
behind the Generals’

snuck

in

defense and

broke away with ball down the left
side. With the game clock running
out, he launched a shot. Bull dove
to his right, deflected the ball, and
turned to watch it roll wide past the
right post to send the game into

overtime.

In the first

overtime, Bull

prevented a loss for the Generals
again by snuffing another one-on-

one breakaway at 11:20.
,W&L’s best scoring chance

in

overtime came in the second period
when the Generals let loose a flurry
of shots after the Eagles could not

giThere’s no place like Liberty Hall

clear the ball from their backfield.

Head coach Rolf Piranian was
not quite satisfied with holding
Mary Washington to a tie. “I felt
like we could have and should have
won,” he said. “In the second half
we got tired, didn't play very smart
and lost our composure.”

The Generals, who have yet to
win a game away from Liberty Hall
Field, took to the ﬁeld Wednesday
for an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game with Lynchburg.

Said Piranian, “This is our
biggest week of the season,"
Piranian said. “We haven’t proven
ourselves on the road this season.”

The Generals continued to be
jinxed on the road, as Lynchburg
ended the Generals’ unbeaten streak
at four with a 3-0 win.

On the season, the Generals are
4-5-1, 2-1 in the ODAC. The
Generals are 4-0-1 at home and
winless in five tries on the road.

W&L will get another chance to
right its road woes with a
conference game at Virginia
Wesleyan Saturday.

The win was W&L’s first ever
on Homecoming weekend. Hathom
encouraged her players to learn
from the experience with what is
the team’s favorite motto: “You
either win or you learn.” She
added, “We just didn’t have a good
day, and we didn’t play our best
game. We couldn’t get anything

our game started to fall apart. The

Like father, like son, like son

Three generations of Jennings reunite for Homecoming

By Joel Dyes
Staff Reporter

Like father, like son.

In journalism Prof. John K.
Jennings‘ family, that expression is
more than just a phrase —- it truly
applies. For three generations,
Jennings men have walked down the
colonnade as students of Washington
and Lee.

During a Homecoming luncheon
Saturday, Jennings, his father and
his son talked about life at W&L.

Prof. Jennings’ 83—year-old
father, Matt Jennings, of
Fayetteville, Tenn., is more robust
than his wiry son. His gruff voice
and expressive eyes say he's a no
nonsense man. He is a little hard of
hearing; Prof. Jennings repeated
many of the questions the reporter
asked.

“I went to Washington and Lee
some years ago,” Matt Jennings
said. “I graduated in 1927. My
brother James and I both did. Of
course he was older. He's 86 now.

"I wanted to breed Jersey
cattle," the senior Jennings recalled,
“but my father wanted me to go to
school and study something else. I
went, to please him. And when I
got out, I bred Jersey cattle.”

The elder Jennings said he
majored in history, ‘math and
geology — "and girls.”

“I'm glad it went co—ed,” he
said. “It’s really much more
convenient. We use to have to go
all the way to Randolph-Macon.”

Jennings’ said he didn't meet his
wife at college.

“Nope, I got her at home in
Tennessee,” he sniffed.

“When I was here," Matt
Jennings said, “I didn't have time
to do much besides study. I
wrestled some, but I needed my
extra time to study. It was difficult
getting through.”

The oldest Jennings said he did
not put pressure on his son to come
to W&L but strongly suggested it.
Prof. Jennings, however, had
interests different from his father’s.

"I wanted to be a journalist, so
that was my major,” said Jemiings,
who graduated from Washington and
Lee in 1956.

'27, John Jennings, '56, and Matthew Jennings,

As a student, said Jennings, his
extra—curricular activities included
The Ring-tum Phi and WREL, the
local radio station.

"We dir.Ln.’t have a radio station
on campus at that time,” he said.
He met his wife Julie during
graduate school at Stanford.

Unlike his father, Prof. Jennings
stuck pretty close to his major when
he graduated. He went to WDBJ-TV
in Roanoke after graduation and in
1959 came back to W&L to teach.

As for co-education, Prof.
Jennings said, “I'm glad the women
came, too. I was all for it from the
beginning. It improved the facilities,
and everything looks better.” ‘

“You lcnow, there wasn't a
footbridge when I was here either,”
the eldest Jennings said. “I don’t
know if that was before the women
or not. But, we use to have to wade
across the bottom.”

The senior Jennings said he did
not spend all of his working years
raising Jersey cattle. He spent 32
years of his life with the Tennessee
Department of Agriculture.

“I was president of the National

Association of Marketing Officials,
President of the National Weights

President of the Weights and
Measures Division of the National
Association of the Commission of
Agriculture,” he said proudly.
“.There’s even a government
building in Fayetteville named for
me. Now, that was a big day. The
mayor and governor even turned out
for that one.”

Jennings retired in 1973. “What
do I do now?” asked. “N0thin’l I
believe the phrase is retired. And,
I am fully that.”

Prof. Jennings, 55, is his parents’
only child.

"He was a good boy, a fine

sort,” his father said. “Not a
moment’s trouble.” Prof. Jennings
smiled, embarrassed, and looked
away.

Prof. Jennings son, Matthew, a
freshman at W&L, has, a sister
Sarah, who is a freshman at

Lexington High School.

“I like Washington and Lee and
decided to come here," Matthew
Jennings said. “My dad didn't try

to make me come or anything; i
just wanted to. I don’t think his
being a professor at the same school
I attend is really a big deal. I just
don’t think about it.

“I'm majoring in journalism,
also, and I have a morning radio
show,” he said. “I plan to try out
for basketball, too.”

“Professor de Maria is his
adviser,” Matthew’s father said. “I
don’t think there's really a chance
I'll get him in one of my classes.
By the time he has to take my
journalism law course, I hope to be
on a sabbatical.”

Matthew’s grandfather said he
keeps in touch with his son and
grandson through phone calls and
visits. “We talk to them about once
a month," he said. I

“And they'll visit about twice a
year or we'll go down," Prof.
Jennings added.

“I have to know everythin
that's going on with W&L,’ sai
the eldest Jennings. “I have to keep
up, and John’s a pretty good
source."
