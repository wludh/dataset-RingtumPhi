of the proletariat.

Czar Willie III

...siezes power in bloodless coup

and gagged, while staff ﬂoozie Genienne Mongno was
taken to Willie's harem.

“I like to think of Washington and Lee as my back
forty,” said Czar Willie, tipping his panama hat as he
called for the dissolution of the Executive Committee and
the administration.

According to conﬁdential sources within the regime,
his mad majesty has indentured former-president John
Wilson and ﬁred the remaining administrators. Sadly,
however, Dean Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins drowned in a
consuming puddle before he heard news of his dismissal
(see story elsewhere on this page).

Immediately following the coup, Willie tossed Wilson
out of the Lee House and into shackles.

“I need a palace ﬁt for a king, if I am to be general-
isimo,” Willie was heard to exclaim as he put his foot on
Wilson, who was bringing him a mint julep.

When asked about the recent Law School secession,
Willie answered, “Eh, let’em go. Who needs that ilk.”

One Willie supporter, Robert J. deMaria, a professor
of journalism, said “I su.re am glad old Willard did this
before the Student Telephone Union did.”

STU representatives failed to comment on the Dumas
coup because they believed the moves fail to affect their
independent organization.

But Field Marshall John Fialcowitz is reported to have
mobilized troops against the STU stronghold, though
defenders have taken the war cry “Death Before Dumas.”

Czar Willie, formerly Willard L. Dumas III, had
recently been voted out of office by the slim margin of
oh, say, 50 percent. The sheer disappointment, sources
say, caused Dumas toigo nose-first into a mental abyss.
Sources say Dumas woke yesterday morning believing he
was Czar Willie III, the sole male descendant of that
autocrat of autocrats, Maurice “Baby Doc” Duvalier, last
ruler of the peaceful tropical isle of Haiti.

Trustees double tuition and say, ‘suck it up’

By a W&L News Office Flack

Washington and Lee's Board of Trustees
voted Monday night to double the school’s
tuition for the 1990-91 school year, according
to unnamed sources.

“Everyone knows students at W&L can
afford to pay at least $20,0()0 a year in
tuition,” said Trustee Beverly DuBose. “If
they want ﬁnancial aid, they can sell their
damn BMW's. They’re just gonna have to
suck it up.”

In October, W&L was named a “best
buy" in liberal arts colleges by U.S. News
and World Report. The magazine quoted
W&L's yearly tuition as $10,100. Under the

plan expected to be passed by the trustees at
their next meeting, that ﬁgure would be
doubled to $20,200. ' ’

“Who the hell wants to be a best buy?”
demanded DuBose. “If you want a best buy,
then go to Wal-Mart and get a nylon leisure
suit for $2.50. If you want a W&L education,
you better expect to pay through the nose just
like everyone else.”

According to a source close to the trus-
tees, who asked that his name not be printed
in this story because of possible violent
attempts at retribution, the trustees have not
yet decided what to do with the windfall of
money the increase will bring.

Among the many plans currently being
allegedly considered is the construction of a

new performing arts center where Liberty
Hall now stands.Upon completion, the theater,
which would cost $4.75 million, would hold
all 75 of W&L’s notoriously rabid drama
fans. It is not known how this new theater
would affect the Lenfest Center, which is
expected to be completed next fall.

“You can never have too many perform-
ing arts centers,” said Coordinator of Capital
Plarming Frank Parsons.

The trustees, according to the source, will
also set aside $45.50 from the general fund to
solve the housing needs of fraternity members
dislodged by the upcoming renovation of
W&L’s fraternity houses.That money will be
used to pay for one night's accommodation in
the Quality Inn in Raphine, Va, located about

20 miles away from campus, sources say.

According to the source, the approximately
70 students‘ displaced in the renovation will
be given the one-bedroom “Bob and Delores
Hope” suite for their own use one night
during fall tenn of next year.

After the money is used up, students will
be left to fend for themselves.

Ironically, the Quality Inn was the scene
of a disastrous fraternity party last spring
which resulted in the wanton destruction of
tables, ceiling tiles and a hot tub, according
to the recently deceased Associate Dean of
Students Leroy C. “I Desperately Need A
New Nickname” Atkins.

To insure that the fraternity members do
not cause any trouble in the Quality Irm,

Lexington Police Ofﬁcer Fred Smith will be
in constant attendance.

“I’m gonna arrest all those little bastards
for drunk in public, resisting arrest, and
public urination," Smith said.

According to DuBose, the tuition increase
will “kill two birds with one stone.”

“If they can’t afford the new tuition, then
students will have to sell their cars,” said
DuBose. “When that happens, there will no
longer be a need for more parking on carn-
pus.”

DuBose said the school has r:-o plans to
add any parking facilities in the future.

“Students wishing to park their cars near
campus are encouraged to go to Harris-
Teeter,” he said.

‘Buddy’ drowns in puddle

By I-I.E. “The real Buddy” Derrick
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University
Dean of Greek Affairs Leroy “Bud-
dy” Atkins drowned Tuesday in a
puddle between the ODK circle and
the Commerce school.

One student dived into the water
to try to save Atkins, but his efforts
were unsuccessful.

Journalism student Linda McCor-
mack, a bystander who saw Atkins
ﬂoundering in the water, called for
help. An unidentiﬁed student dived in
to try to rescue Atkins, but was un-
able to pull the dean out in time to
save his life.

“I had him, and I could have
saved him, but then he just slipped
out of my hands and was gone,” the
student, thought to be a member of
the Sigma Aqua fraternity, said.

McCorrnack, who is famous in
her home state for ﬁve daring water
rescues of her own, said, “I would
have gone in to save him myself, but
I just didn’t feel like getting wet this
time. The water was too cold."

An ambulance was called and
police divers dragged the bottom of
the puddle for Atkins’ body, which
was recovered about 45 minutes after
he disappeared into the cold, brown
water.

Farnie “points or cash” Lewis, a
cashier in the Co-op, said that she
saw the whole thing happen.

“I was just getting off work and
walking to my car when I saw that
little man trying to wade through the
puddle in his galoshes. He must have
hit a drop off or something, because
all of the sudden he just disap-
peared”

The puddle accumulated after last
weekends heavy rains. Police report

that the water level was four inches
above ﬂood stage at the time of the
incident.

Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment head James Arthur said that
he’s been trying to get funding for a
new drainage system for the site, but
that University money has been tied
up in other projects.

“Frank Parsons [W&L coordinator
of capital development] promised that
we could have the money to’ ﬁx the
problem as soon as the Lenfest Cen-
ter and the Fraternity Renaissance and
the addition to the science buildings
and the new student center and the
new skyboxes in the Wilson ﬁeld
bleachers and the new sub-Colonnade
parking garage and the twenty story
addition to the C-school were all
completed.’ ‘

FD over budget;
SAB resigns

By Baghwan Ghita
Staff Reporter

The Student Activities Executive ,

Board abruptly resigned Tuesday
when the ﬁgures for the 1990 Fancy
Dress Ball were released.

An anonymous spokeswoman from
the board informed newly ordained,
self-proclaimed czar Willard III that
the graft and corruption within the
organization had “resulted in the
complete erosion of confidence of
anyone, anywhere, in its competen-
cy.”

SAB chairman Charles Conklin,
last seen boarding the SAB Lear jet
housed in Roanoke, had assured The
Ring-tum Phi last week in an inter-
view that the Fancy Dress proﬁt

W&L Law School

By Phillip Morris
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Law
School‘ seceded from the university
Tuesday night, after a meeting of the
Law School Federalist Society.

In a meeting that lasted three and
a half hours in which 305 law stu-
dents participated, ﬁrst year law
student Mitch Neurock passed around
a petition calling for secession.

Student Bar Association President
John Falk railed against secession,
arguing on behalf of a uniﬁed Honor
System. On Neurock’s petition, Falk
said later, “Neurock’s an idiot, and
we ought to tar, feather, and kick
him out of school.”

Later, after the meeting, Neurock
gathered a group of about 60 law

students who ran around the universi-
ty partially and completely unclothed,
chanting, “No way...we won’t stay!”
After the meeting ended, Law
School Dean “Feelin” Randy Bezan-
son held a three-martini late-night
pow-wow with university President
John Wilson, and members of the
Board of Trustees, who happened to
be in town for a meeting of the
Loyal Order of Water Buffalos.

Wednesday morning the Board of
Trustees issued a simple statement,
“The W&L Law School has been
sold to the law school students on a
cooperative basis for the amount of
$67.12.”

When pressed to answer what the
$67.12 was spent on, a board mem-
ber reluctantly revealed that the board
had bought a keg and lamented their
loss.

expectations...probably a proﬁt two
times in excess of the $70,000 bud-
get.”

But our unnamed source claimed
otherwise. She said, “Unexpected
board expenditures this year will
erode any proﬁts, and probably cost
between $450,000-500,000.”

Among the larger expenses not
itemized in the FD budget were the
long-term lease on the board's Lear
jet, the hand-tailored leisure suits
bought for formal board events, and
the purchase of a suite at the Key-
det-General Hotel for board "recre-
ation". FD Chairman Alex Hitz,
reached at the Keydet-General, re-
sponded to this latest crisis in SAB
management by reﬂecting on his
qualifications for the job. “I do not

Newly self-proclaimed Student
Body Czar Willie Dumas was not as
easy to give in. Shortly after the
statement was issued, Willie gathered
his EC army and formed a protest
line around Bezanson’s house, refus-
ing to let him return to campus Wed-
nesday.

Bezanson managed to make one
phone call before the Executive Com-
mittee’s operations expert, Chris Gib-
lin, cut the phone lines. Within min-
utes the board members showed up
and outnumbered the EC members,
forcing them to give up.

Following the incident, Willie
decided that perhaps Neurock had a
point. “After all,” Willie rational-
ized, “now the SAB won’t have to
allocate any of its budget to the law
goobs.”

 

  

OPINION

The Ring-tum Phi, April 1, 1990

Armchair Ethics

The problem with journalists today is they have no ethics
at all. For instance, in today’s The Ring-tum Phi several un-
named sources are used. Journalists are expected to consider
the question whether or not to use a conﬁdential source’s
name while writing his story. If the reporter did name his
source, the source could suffer serious retribution from the
people he blew the whistle on, like a fellow named Luigi
who might break his knees.

Washington and Lee’s “young reporter,” Clark Mollen-
hoff, has written extensively on the subject of anonymous
attribution. He believes anonymous attribution allows the
whistle-blower to hide his motives and at the same time give
the accused an upset stomach.

Other journalists pray to the god of the anonymous
source. They use the words “conﬁdential sources say” like
an artist uses paint.

We at the Phi try to walk the line and ﬁnd a place for
the anonymous source, but to use him sparingly because he
steals from our credibility.

The reporter must ask himself if the credibility added to
the story and the value of the information he has only by
this source is worth the risk to this one, single person, who
he’ll probably never ever see again. Well of course it is.
Use his name, run his photograph, walk all over him.

No, no, no. Just joking. As journalists of the highest
order, we would feel obligated to our sources if a sig-
niﬁcant danger for them is involved.

For instance, every unnamed source in today’s paper is
actually the same person. It would be unethical to give his
name, which happens to be E. Amie Fitzgerald. People
could look in the phone book and ﬁnd his address, which is
404 Gaines Dormitory, and his phone number is 464-3683.
We would never wish that on anybody.

Further, we would never
ever run a photograph of
the anonymous source, like
the one to the right. This
picture of Amie was taken
just last year, when he was
a freshman. Nope, purely
un-ethical. Anybody could
recognize him on streets.
Never do that to an anony-
mous source.

Intimate details about the
source’s life are way off
limits. We would never tell
you that Arnie smokes
dope, or that he keeps his
stash hidden in a carved out
thesaurus. He’s not really
worried that the police
might find it, because that’s where he got it. He is worried
about his roommate though, who smokes the stuff like a
chimney.

Well, that’s today’s ethical lesson. We did learn that you
shouldn’t print an anonymous source’s name, unless it’s just

a good friend anyway who won’t mind when Luigi comes
knocking on his door.

Just kidding

Needless to say, we’ve had a helluva lot of fun putting
together this week’s so-called Ring-tum Phi, and we hope
everyone gets a kick out of it. All the facts and quotations
in this issue are ﬁctitious or semi-ﬁctitious ones cooked up
by the Phi staff. The photographs have also been subject to
a little game-playing.

We hope our readers and the victims enjoy our April
Fool’s fun. Remember.... It’s only a joke!

Looking back as a liberal

MY VOO DOO
By Robert J. de Maria

Modern economic historians have recorded a
crazy-quilt pattern of mergers, take—overs and other
ﬁscal shenanigans that would have made the late-
eighties bad-boy Ivan Boesky puff up with pride.
Since the days of Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, Wall Street powerhouses ran rough shod
over the ﬁnancial prairie.

I recall a conversation 10 years ago. I had just
taken an entire class period bemoaning the fact
that merger mania had tainted the hallowed halls of
Ivy. Two universities — one from Japan and one
from West Virginia — had merged. After the class,
I was confronted by an Associate Editor of the
The Ring-tum Phi, Jim Lake. Lake, a senior back
in 1990, was then the neo-conservative voice of

 

My alarmism was nothing
more than another irrational
revisionist tirade fueled by
my sixties permissiveness.

reason. Yes, the same Jim Lake who is now the
Press Secretary for President Jesse Jackson. But, I
digress.

I was decrying the fact that Takei University
had rescued the economically weak Salem Univer-
sity of West Virginia. I expressed disgust that
higher education had become a business, like any
other ﬁrm hawking its wares in the market place.

I recalled that Lake chastised me in front of a
group of fellow faculty members, telling me that
my alarmism was nothing more than another irra-
tional revisionist tirade fueled by my sixties per-

missiveness.

Last week, in The Village Voice, Lake rightly
attacked Georgetown University for accepting “30
pieces of silver" from Donald Trump, becoming
Georgetown/I‘rump-;t1e-University. Serious business
this.

I never thought I could agree with Lake, but
time has wizened us all. The time has come to
unfurl our barmers. Let us call a halt to the post
Reagan-Bush VooDoo economics. We must raise
our voices in righteous indignation. Let us circulate
petitions supporting Lake. In so doing, we must
impress upon President Jackson that the time to

strike is now! He must see the truth: the private _

sector with its philosophy of proﬁts no matter what
the cost is wrong.

Pick up your petitions in The Ring-tum Phi
ofﬁces. The address is c/o the Eddie Murphy Tele-
communications center, Arsenio Hall, Room 200,
Washington and Lee University.

The W&L-VMI coeducation cover-up

2

l  ) Freshmen, P/e..§J]°

 

I’M SKEWED
By Fred Schwab

I've had it with the rumor and
innuendo splashed across the pages
of The Ring-tum Phi. We've been fol-
lowing the story for weeks, but now,
thanks only to the efforts of Keydet
reporter Liz Smith and the VMI
campus news (beige journalism at its
best), the facts have at last been
straightened out.

I saw the article during a break in
the action last Saturday night at Har-
ris Teeter, where I work part-time as
a bag boy. (Do students realize that
most W&L faculty, thanks to lousy

hold second jobs? I earned the job by
virtue of my victory in this year’s
Lip Synch Competition, rendering a
smash version of the larnbada tune,
“Paper or Plastic.") At any rate, as
I waited for a group of Phi Delts
fresh from community choir practice
to panhandle enough spare change to
pay for their six packs of club soda,
my eyes quickly skimmed the account
accurately rendered by the VMI
newspaper.

According to its article, the ern-
barrassing incident did occur, al-
though not, as originally rumored, on
the ski slopes of Aspen. It happened
instead just this side of Virginia
Beach, on the slopes of Mount Trash-
more, the brand new ski resort Bill

to be a Virginia landﬁll project.

It seems that President John Wil-
son of W&L (affectionately known as
“The John”), and Superintendent
John Knapp of VMI (referred to on
the post as “The Head”), were en-
joying the midwinter holiday recently
awarded jointly to their institutions
for “exceptional achievement in
higher education",by. the Board of
Editors of National Review.

Evidently, as the two schussed
down the slope, skillfully avoiding
egg cartons and orange rinds, “The
Head" nearly careened into a dis-
grtmtled group of VMI grads who
identiﬁed themselves as “Men
Against Realistic Legal Association”
(MARLA). A couple of knowing

“The John” had been involved in
some sort of clandestine relationship
with MARLA for some time.

Now, reports the VMI rag (and
WHERE was the Phil), it seems that
a “Pre-Coeducational Agreement”
exists that was jointly signed by
“The Head” and “The John" three
years ago (and updated as recently as
three months ago). The exact details
are sketchy, but the VMI paper sug-
gests it hinges on the following. If
“The John" and his cohorts on the
Hill support the efforts of the federal
government to bring VMI out of the
18th century (where it belongs) and
into the 19th century (where W&L

This grievance is not directed to the stupid
$5 fee of the registrar's ofﬁce, nor the worthless
P.E. procedures that everyone must endure every
registration period. It is not even about the
insidious parking situation in this god-forsaken
town, which we all know is horriﬁc enough. I
want to know why Lexington/Rockbridge County
is one of only 108 counties in the entire nation
to not have a Taco—Bell.

I don’t even want to hear that garbage about
“we have enough junk food in this town al-
ready.” Taco-Bell serves quality, wholesome,
Tex-Mex style food for a reasonable charge. It
seems as though there is an aversion to this type
of food in this valley, a place where Chi-Chi’s
provides the ONLY authentic (HA!) Mexican
food within 350 miles.

It seems to me that, if $13 million can be
sunk into a theatre for eight drama majors, then
$200,000 could be sucked out of some fat cat
alum for a Taco-Bell franchise. If they really
want to help the students survive, I mean live in
this town, then this is the only way to do it.

Cops on top

I am an underclassman, so forgive my naive-
ness, but I think that maybe the Lexington police
are a little over-protective. Last weekend, some
of my girlfriends went with me out on Washing-
ton Street to several fraternity parties. Well, to
make a long story short, I scammed on three
brothers upstairs and was left by my friends.
When they threw me out of the house, a police-
man befriended me and offered to escort me
back to the dorm. When we got back to my
room, he said he needed to come in and secure
the place. Well, embarrassing as it is, he is now
escorting me every weekend wherever I go. I
didn't realize the police force was so “friendly"
here in Lexington, yet I ﬁnd no one will let me
and my escort into their parties. If I end our
little “relationship," I’ll probably wind up in the
slamrner next weekend for solicitation! What
should I do??

Copped out,

will be, I wouldn't mind it so much.

If you didn't run the “Sbar Side” each week,
you'd have more room for real issues, like the

Otherwise, I’d love to see some more reprints

Oh! de toilette

I would like to comment on the dangerous
size of the toilet seats in the University Library.
I mean, you could actually fall into the commode
if you're not careful! Was the builder planning
for beached whales to relieve themselves in there,
or what? I realize that the gross tonnage of the
average W&L student seems to have increased
since coeducation ﬁve years ago, but those cans
were installed when the building was completed
in 1979! I have brought this to the attention of
the librarian, but she said she doesn't have a
problem with their size. Please negotiate a new
contract for smaller toilet seats, or install 2 X 4s
in every stall.

Relieved,

Tiny Tush, '92

P.S. — Is it true that the toilet pipes are directly
connected to the dining hall water supply?

1 Word has come back to a stunned Washington and
Lee campus today from Sunnyview Mental Institution
iii Bismark, North Dakota, where James W. Worth,
University Counseling Psychologist, has been pro-
nounced “clinically insane,” according to head
tiosychologist of the institution, Homer Q. Klinefelter.

,, Worth was sent to the top mental institution in the
nation for treatment following his crazed rampage in
duPont Hall two weeks ago.

, According to university security, Worth was found
running through the halls of the duPont Gallery

‘ Apparently Worth was carrying a large picture of
IDean Anne Shroer-Lamont and was screaming at the
top of his lungs “that the true Mona Lisa must be

y Worth proceeded to tear down various works of art,
denouncing them as “so many pieces of trash,”
pparently in search of proper placement of Shroer-
Lamont’s portrait.

In an interview with university security, Agent
Baner of Parking Control was called in to handle this
sensitive situation.

Baner stated that when he arrived at the scene
Worth was acting “like those crazy horses at the ro-
deo.”

Fearing for his life and that of his fellow officers
is Worth began to hurl pottery, Agent Baner acted
,swiftly to subdue the crazed psychologist with his stun
gun, now carried by all university security personnel.

Agent Baner writes Worth off.

Agent Baner stated “I didr1’t want to have to zap
the poor dude, but the pottery launching was the final
straw.”

Sources told the Phi that the ROTC department was
told to place their crack anti~terrorist squad on full
alert, in case the situation warranted full
military intervention.

Worth was quoted as saying before passing out as he
tightly clutched Shroer-Larnont’s picture “my passion
for true artwork will not be quenched.”

President Wilson refused the Phi’s request for

Renaissance plans to house

r‘ The W&L Fraternity Renaissance,
sfheduled to begin in the spring, has
unearthed some serious logistical and
housing concerns, which were quelled
in a forum Tuesday night by Wash-

The forum was held in the grand
lobby of the as-yet unfinished Lenfest

The attendees, among them the
entire Performing Arts faculty and
Kevin Nash, braved sub-zero tempera-

steps the university will take to house

ction of the 16 houses.

to announce that we have cut a deal
with the Virginia Horse Center to
turn the new indoor arena into week-

said.

Horse Center spokesperson Bea
Stiality remarked, "This unique
agreement allows for the arena to be
used for housing and showing studs
Monday through Friday, and bitches
on the weekend, with virtually no
alterations."

While Wilson admits some road
women may be galled at the thought

of sleeping in a barn, "most of them, .
don’t know , where they will sleep,

when they arrive in Lexington anyw-
ay, so we are providing a service
long overdue."

Renaissance Color Coordinator
Big Al Schlitz, reached at his Key-
det-General office, said ''I am really
pleased about this agreement. Those
road girls were interfering with my
creative abilities, telling me how to
mix and match my color schemes...it
was just dreadful."

Wilson has transferred the duties
of Fraternity Dean "Bud Man" At-
kins, who died in a freak drowning
incident in front of the Co-op Tues-
day afternoon, to current Minority
Student Dean Aneece McCloud, who
was last seen attending an emergency
meeting with Czar Willie III at his
Winter palace on Washington Street.

When members of the Performing
Arts faculty were asked to comment
on Wilson’s plan, they collectively
remarked, "Gee, won't this room be
great’? We can have receptions and
show art and waste lots of our en-
dowment. This building really is
essential, you know that, don’t you?"

This agreement will commence
with the first annual Alurnni-Road

held on the upper fields April 26-28.

Hill Ski-lift on the way

By Christopher Robin
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees met last
week in a special emergency session
by request of President John Wilson
to discuss the feasibility and the
urgency of constructing a student
transportation system from the Jeffer-
son Street parking lot to the middle
of the Colonnade.

In an interview Pres. Wilson
stated that this plan basically con-
sisted of “sort of a chair lift, like at
ski resorts” to transport students

from the “Corral” to the hill.
Wilson stated that the University
is trying to solve the problem of
drastically reduced student attendance
of classes.
In a random sampling of repeat

Associate Dean of Fraternity Af-
fairs Leroy “Your Buddy and Mine”
Atkins was shocked when he received
news of the mounting debt from His
Imperial Highness Willie III.

Shortly before his untimely

is really gonna hose me. I’m going to
swim in this mess for a long time.”

attendance offenders, most stated that
the reason they blew off many of
their classes was because they were
“too damn tired to walk up the
Hill.”

President Wilson added that this
proposal has him “elated and opti-
mistic” and that he is “willing to
ram it down the trustees’ throats to
get it.”

The most serious problem seems
to originate in the area of the five

Wilson, “but the chair lift proposal 3:»-P‘.

Rush moved to junior year

By I.P. Frehley
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee President
John W. Wilson announced yesterday
to the Inter-Fraternity Council his
plans to move rush once again.

This time, however, Wilson- wants
rush to take place in spring term of
a‘ student’s junior year. “I want to
give students plenty of time to adjust
to college before they have to go
through the difficult and confusing
rush procedure,” he told the slightly
bewildered council. “I figure three
years should about do it."

In accordance with these new rush
rules, fraternities are not allowed to

BACKTALK

make contact with prospective rushees
until the third week of April in their
junior year, meaning seniors will not
be able to engage in social activities
with roughly 3/4 of the male popula-
tion at Washington and Lee.

Not wanting to discriminate, sen-
iors will also not be allowed to make
contact with 3/4 of the female pop-
ulation of W&L, as well as most
domestic animals. Confronted with
this fact, Leroy ’Buddy’ Atkins
warned last week, “They’ll have to
learn to deal with it.”

In place of fraternity parties, Wil-
son plans to encourage future stu-
dents to partake in the plethora of
social and cultural opportunities that
the town of Lexington offers.

In addition to this cornucopia of
options, weekend bingo and badrrtitten
tournaments will be added to the ’
social calendar. 

Fraternities did not take the news

well. Atkins was swarmed by per-  j

turbed protestors who petitioned and
argued with the Dean for hours ex-
plaining that witliout fraternities lives
of students would be as dull as his.

Atkins remained unswayed and re-
pledged his support for the president 1

Lex police kill naked student

By Jon Sbar
Staff Reporter

A Washington and Lee student led
Lexington Police Department officers
and Central Intelligence Agency age-
nts on a dramatic cross-carnpus chase
before he was cornered and shot in
Lee Chapel.

Alaskan exchange student Eskimo
Henderson died at Stop-Iri Conve-
nience Store en route to the hospital
at shortly after 11:30 that night.

According to paramedic Sam
Stitches, the ambulance was not driv-
en directly to the hospital because the
vehicle needed gas. “The ambulance
needed gas, plus I was hungry," he
said.

“We never expected the guy to
die like that. What a bummer,”he
said.

Henderson's drama began in the
campus library after he was spotted
foniicating with a Lexington High
School student by Officer Joe Buck-
shot.

“I was patrolling the library when
I happened to look in one of those
private study rooms and saw those
two fornicatin’ right there on the
carpet,” said Buckshot. “The were
grindin’ and ﬂailin’ and carryin’ on
and all in such a debacherous manner
that I thought I was going to be
sick.”

A recently enacted taxation agree-

ment between the Washington and
Lee administration and the Lexington
City Council empowers the police to
patrol the campus in search of stu-
dents who have not paid their car tax.

According to police records, after
Henderson noticed that he was being
watched by a police officer, he disen-
tangle himself from his partner and
ran naked out of the study room.

The female consort, whose name
has been withheld because she is a
minor, said Henderson's departure
was abrupt.

“One minute we're on the carpet
having — well, a good time - and
the next thing I know, Eskimo is
gone,” she said. “He left everything.
His khaki pants, his button down
oxford, his W&L belt, his boots, his
baseball cap, and even his check-
book."

Apparently, Henderson was not
wearing underwear last night in the
library. V

Police said Buckshot pursued the
ﬂeeing Henderson out of the library
and into the commerce school. In the
C—school, Buckshot was joined by
several CIA agents, who were on
campus to recruit students for the
agency.

According to witnesses, Buckshot
and the agents followed the naked
fugitive into the University Center.

With the authorities hot on his

trail, Henderson crashed into a Stu-
dent Activities Board meeting where

board members were busy eating
caviar and drinking champagne.

SAB representative Buford “I take
bribes" Beefcake said that Hender-
son's intrusion ruined the meeting.
“After that unclothed heathen ran
through the room everyone their
appetite and even had to throw out a
perfectly good chocolate mousse."

Henderson left the meeting
through a back door and ran into the
dining hall where the Panhellenic
Eating Club was having lunch. At the
sight of Hendeisori’s naked body, the
women became rowdy and began
pelting Buckshot and the CIA agents
with cottage cheese and low calorie
salad dressing.

“Golly geez,” said a dining hall
employee after the incident, “from
the way those women carried on
you'd think it was the first time they
ever saw a naked man."

Henderson exited the dining hall
and ran across the colonnade into Lee
Chapel where Dean Betty Beluwba
was conducting a date rape clinic.
Dean Beluwba was so enraged by the

intrusion that she grabbed Henderson

by the head.

As Henderson struggled to break
free of Beluwba, Officer Buckshot
and the CIA agents moved close to
the fugitive and fired bullets into the
back of his head.

“Its too bad that kid had to die
that way," said Buckshot, “but I
sure have to admit, I had fun killing
him.."

4?’

‘By John Laney
‘Staff Reporter

T First came the new track. Coming
.,soon to Wilson Field will be
Astroturf. What could the Washington
‘ and Lee Athletic Department possibly
‘think of next? .
, That question was answered
‘yesterday when W&L athletic director
Mike Walsh said that planning is
underway to construct six luxury-
asuite boxes on top of the stands at
Wilson Field.
The “sky-boxes," as they are
qcommonly known, will resemble the
luxury suites found at major stadiums
‘throughout the country. Each will be
.able to hold four people and will
have a wet bar, television set and a
‘ terrace for outside viewing.
5 “I’ve been toying with this idea
since I began my duties in
“ December,” Walsh said during a
press conference held on Wilson

’Field. “This area desperately needs

sponrs
‘Sky-boxes for Wilson Field

a first-class stadium. You have to go
to Washington, D.C. or Philadelphia
just to sit in a sky-box. Soon, though,
Wilson Field will provide area sports
fans with just such a luxury.”

Walsh said the University would
purchase at least one of the luxury
suites for its own use and the rest
would be sold to local businesses and
industries on a first-come, first-serve
basis. University Cleaners, Lloyd’s of
Lexington, Wal-Mart and Blue-Bird
Bus Lines of Buena Vista have
already expressed an interest in
buying a luxury suite.

“The luxury suites will virtually
pay for themselves. Companies will
buy them and then bring their clients
to watch W&L athletic events,”
Walsh said.

The suite owned by the University
will be used by the faculty and
administration on a rotating basis.

Walsh, who said the cost of
building the sky-boxes had not been
determined, indicated that the
expected demand for the boxes may

persuade the University to build
another set of stands with six more
sky-boxes on the other side of
Wilson Field.

“At .the very least, that would
make the Smythe kid happy," Walsh
said, referring to senior quarterback
Chris Smythe’s complaint that he was
tired of hearing the opposing teams’
fans cheer right behind the W&L
bench.

Walsh explained the the boxes
would not be built until after the
Astroturf had been installed.

“That way we’ll be able to have
nearly every outdoor sport play their
games on Wilson Field. We’ll create
a schedule in which tliere’l1 be a
game of one sort or another on
Wilson Field nearly every day during
the fall and spring. This will give the
owners of the boxes an opportunity
to watch more than just football and
men’s lacrosse,” Walsh said.

Walsh predicted that the only
difficulty he would encounter in
requiring teams to play their home

§Football’s Fallon takes off

‘Staff Reporter

‘ ' Hello Big Apple, here comes Gary
‘Fallon.

1 Last night, the W&L football
tcoach was offered, and accepted the
head coaching job with the National

ootball League’s New York Jets.
4 In the brief phone conversation
with Jets’ General Manager Joe Kay,
Fallon was praised for his accom-
,plishments at the college level and
invited to coach the team beginning
'June 1.

4 “We were impressed with his
credentials, his coaching record and
his haircut,” Kay said in a presss
‘conference this morning.

This is not the first time in the

Fallon called his own press con-
ference this moming, at which time
he announced his intentions to bring
along two of the Generals’ standouts
and the unknown talent to New York
with him.

Fallon said senior standout Phillip
Sampson will be platooning at quar-
terback with former New England
Patriots quarterback Tony Eason.

“He could be the next Joe Na-
math,” Fallon said of Sampson.

Running back Mason Pope will
forgo his last year of college eligibili-
ty for the NFL, Fallon announced
after he said Jets running back Free-
man MacNeil will probably be traded
for draft picks.

“I feel Mason will rush, catch
and block as good or better than
MacNeil ever did, and at a cheap[er

games on Wilson Field would come
from the rugby tearri.

“Who has ever heard of a rugby
player not being covered in mud at
the end of a match?” Walsh asked.

However, not everyone in the
athletic department supports Walsh's
plan.

“This guy (Walsh) has only been
here for a few months and already
he's trying to stir things up,” said
Associate Athletic Director Richard
Miller. “In the old days we didn’t
even have bleachers to sit on. Heck,
we didn’t even have football helmets
or pads. Everything in sports is
getting too fancy. I’d like to see a
return to the old days when every
football play was ‘four yards and a
cloud of dust’.”

The proposal for the luxury suites
will be submitted to the Board of
Trustees in the fall, Walsh said.

“If everything goes according to
schedule we should have the luxury
suites in place for the start of the
1994 football season.”

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

From W&L Sports Information

A late edition to ‘the spring
term offerings has just been an-
nounced. Proving that it can
keep up with the times, the ath-
letic department yesterday un-
veiled their plans for a “Lam-
bada" class.

Lambada, the dance craze
sweeping the nation, is a Brazil-
ian form of “dirty dancing.”

When the idea was first prese-
nted at a recent staff meeting,
coach Dick Miller agreed to per-
sonally teach the course. VMI’s
coach Dennis Daly will write the
curriculum.

Miller is very excited about
the idea. “Athletics is not only
good for the body and soul,” he
stated, “but it should also be fun.
Ever since I became a Lambada
freak, I have been waiting to
teach the ‘moves’ to the coeds.”

Register in the athletic office
by Friday, April 6th.

The athletic office is proud to
announce that the Boccie Interest
Group will be legitimized next
fall as a full varsity sport.

Boccie, a sport of Italian orig-
in, is similar to lawn bowling. It
is played on a narrow clay court
with a wooden ball.

To accommodate the new
sport, the old Twombly pool will
be converted to the necessary
facilities. Construction will take
place this summer once the Len-
fest Performing Arts Center is
completed.

Athletics Director Michael
Walsh stated, “I am very proud
that W&L is again on the fore-
front of a new phenomenon.”
He hopes that general education
courses in boccie will soon be
added to the department.

A boccie coach has yet to be
hired. Kayaking lessons, held in
the Twombly pool, will now be
held in the Leroy “Buddy” At-
kins Memorial Puddle in front of
the Co-op.

Toon will be filled by unknown talent
Trey Tune, a W&L junior who has
yet to play out any of his four years

of eligibility.

When asked to comment on
Tune’s credentials, Fallon said “his
blazing speed and steady hands will
make Darrell Green and Deon Sand-
ers quiver in their Reebok’s.”

Fallon said he discovered the
5’9”, 155 lbs. Tune while watching
an intramural football game on the
Although Tune has
never played organized football at
any level, he “should have no prob-
lem adjusting to the game after he
gets used to wearing a helmet and

Trustees and company create maior

Plans for a Catch a Bachelor of Arts Degree put into works by committee

By Bambi Stark
Staff Reporter

In an effort to continue its ongo-
ing pursuit of opportunities for Wash-
ington and Lee females, the Board of
Trustees voted unanimously last week
to create a new type of degree just
for them. Graduation requirements for
The Catch a Bachelor of Arts Degree,
or the MRS Degree, will soon be
available to enterprising females who
have no need for boring C-School
classes, but do want lucrative post-
graduate marriage prospects.

Although the armouncernent to
create a new major within the C-
School was just made, a five-faculty
member MRS Committee has already
been appointed to oversee its progress
and implementation into the regular
W&L curriculum by next fall. The
committee, which consists of Dean of
Freshmen Kermeth P. Ruscio, Chem-
istry Professor J. Keith Shillington,
History Professor Jefferson D. Futch,
Mathematics Professor Wayne Dyrna-
cek, and Religion Instructor
Alexandra Brown.

“I think it will be fun,” said

‘ Ruscio, the committee spokesman.

The MRS committee decided that
the major would be based in the
Commerce School for a variety of
reasons. According to Economics
Professor Edward C. Atwood Jr.,
whom the committee chose to assume
the role of MRS Department Head
officially in September, the main
reason for the MRS Department being
based in the C-School was simply
because “the men who will probably
make the most money attend classes
here.” “I am very supportive of this
major, it allows women to be sharks,
not by playing the market, but by
playing the ﬁeld,” Atwood stated.

Of course the availability of the
new degree will also call for several
departmental changes and the commit-
tee has worked at lightning speed
secure them. Because each department
will be asked to implement at least
one or two courses that may be used
by MRS majors for general education
requirements, several Sweet Briar and
Hollins College graduates will be
recruited as Associate or Assistant
Professors in order to accommodate
the new curriculum that will be nec-

essary, according to Ruscio.

The following class offerings or
adjustments are being considered by
the committee and will be voted on
for recommendation to the Board of
Trustees at its April Fool's Meeting
Sunday evening:

Religion: Religion 241, “Women in
Religions,” will be restructured to
cover “How Delilah and Bathsheba
Got Their Men,” an in-depth course
dealing with the devious behavior and
roles created by the world’s foremost
con-women.

Sociology and Anthropology: Profes-
sor David Novack has offered to
teach “Mythical Male Dominance and
the Use of Scarves."

Romance Languages: A series of
graduated workshops dealing with
elementary, interrriediate, and ad-
vanced dirty talk.

Chemistry: A ﬁve-day a week lab
“Makeup Matching and Blending" A
color-analysis Workshop was also
suggested, depending on the degree
of interest.

Journalism: “Library Resources,”
will teach females how to investigate
the backgrounds of their targets and
research their areas of interest.
History: "What Women Looked Like
in the Past,”to be followed by a
“Fashion Current Events” course.
Drama: “How to Fake Anything."

The most dramatic change will
probably be seen in the Commerce
School itself, which will see more
feminine decorations, like pink toilet
seats and an abundance of loudspeak-
ers playing Wham! and Michael
Damian hits.

Depending on the number of inter-
ested women, the MRS Department
could be moved to another location.
Ruscio said that the committee would
deal with that hurdle later, although
the Law School had been recom-
mended as a great MRS hunting
ground.

Right now, the most blatant void
in the program seems to be in creat-
ing domestic or nurturing classes.
Ruscio pointed out that, while the C-
School will handle the most crucial
courses to the MRS major, such as
the Economics Department’s ward-
robe-budget planning course and the
“View Love As a Business” course,
others are desperately needed “Who
do you think is going to do the cook-

ing, sewing, and repeated child birth-
ing and raising after the yoimg ladies
have reeled their senior theses to the
alters?" Ruscio asked.

Although President John D. Wil-
son could not be reached for com-
ment, his wife Anne told The Phi
that she is just itching to teach a
baking course. “I guess I took my
lead from Anne Schroer-Lamont,”
she said. Wilson is referring to a
Schroer-Lamont’s brief, but glorious,
stint as the national winner of the
Betty Crocker cook—off two years ago
that landed her a contract to appear
publically as the new and improved
Betty. Schroer-Lamont grew tired of
the circuit andretumed to her job at
W&L as Associate Dean of Students
after one summer.

Wilson also said that many other
faculty wives were eager to teach
W&L females the “tricks of the
trade” so that they can land husbands
with better paying jobs.

Future Homemakers of America, a
high school domestic club has also
offered to lend its services in the
event that qualiﬁed instructors cannot
be found.

The final requirement before grad-
uation for the MRS major will be the
procurement of at least one bona-fide
marriage proposal with a ring to
prove it. Those with three proposals
will graduate Cum laude, those with
four proposals will graduate Magna
cum laude, those with five proposals
or more will graduate Summa cum
laude and offered an Assistant Profes-
sorship. Candidates must also undergo
a battery of skill examinations, which
will evaluate one's performance and
technique at ten of the university's
fraternities.

An exchange program with the
area women's colleges is being dis-
cussed, however Ruscio said he did-
n’t think it would be acted upon.
“Why should our instructors aid the
MRS majors’ competition?”he asked.

Other problems with the new
majors include protests by stubborn
liberal females. who wish to earn a
MS Degree instead of an MRS De-

The Phi

gree and the faction of homosexual
males on campus, who complain that
they are being discriminated against
by the entire structure of the new
major, which is designed for ;v_o_mgn
who want to attract men.

The idea for the MRS Degree was
presented to the Board by Assistant
Professor of Physical Education Cinda
Rankin and Associate Dean of Stu-
dents Anne Schroer—Lamont, who feel
very strongly about the advancement
of women in society, no matter how,
although both agree that a good mar-
riage is the best strategy.

Rankin, admitted that she joined
the W&L Physical Education Depart-
ment in 1985 with hopes of finding
the right mate. “I’m a sucker for
well-developed chest and abdominal
muscles, what better place to look?”
she said. “I thought the way to make
a man drool was by lifting as much
as he did in the weight room,” said
Rankin, “then I realized, why bother?
I mean it’s so much easier to capture
that special someone with your femi-
ninity, you can easily do that by
participating in activities like cheer-
leading and wearing those cute peek-
a-boo skirts.”

True to her attitude, Rankin has
decided to give up coaching tennis
and instead sponsor a W&L cheer
squad, which would also function as
a five credit P.E. course. Men are
encouraged to try out in the fall for
the squad, however Rankin said they
will be given no special treatment.
“They’ll have to shake their booties

just like everyone else,” she said.

As for the rest of the university,
a panel discussion on the MRS De-
gree will be held tonight from 8:00-
10:00 p.m. (out of consideration for
those who watch L.A. Law) in the
Arlington Women's Center for those
with questions, suggestions, or input.

Editors note: Hats off to Bambi, a
former W&L head cheerleader, who
just completed her last shock treat-
ment due to a scandalous affair
with Jim Bakker two years ago. We
love ya’ babe!
