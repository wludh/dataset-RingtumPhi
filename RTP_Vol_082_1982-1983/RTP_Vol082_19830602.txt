Fear and loathing in the Galapago

By HENRY LANGHORNE
Special-to-the-Phi

We hit the language barrier in
Miami.

The Miami airport resembles
a carpeted shopping mall.
There are many. stores,
counters, telephones, and
vacuum cleaners, and at 11:40
p.m., not many people pushing
vacuum cleaners knew how to
speak English.

We were trying to find the In-
osphere Lounge on the Eastern
wing of the airport. Diane
Bowen and Wendy Carter were
waiting there for us. Diane was
an editor for one of Professor
Hickman’s books, The Biology
of Animals. Wendy was a friend
Diane met hot-air ballooning.
They were from St. Louis, and
they said that a lot of people get
in baskets attached to balloons
and float around St. Louis.

I guess it was natural for each
of us to imagine we were
Charles Darwin beginning his
famous voyage as a naturalist
on the H.M.S. Beagle in
December 1831. For me there
were several parallels with
Charles: we were both 22 years
old when we left on our trips, we
both were planning on going to

medical school, and we both
had fathers and grandfathers

who were doctors. But that’s

about where the similarities
end.

Charles’ trip lasted four
years, nine months, and two
days; mine lasted 20 days.
Charles left England on a three-
masted, 64-foot, naval survey
vessel built in Devonport,
England. We boarded a Boeing
727 jet built in Seattle powered
by three 7,000 horsepower
engines, and cruised at 750
miles per hour, 35,000 feet
above the water Charles floated
across. There were 74 people
packed into the Beagle. More
than 200 of us sat comfortably in
reclining chairs in an_ air-
conditioned cabin while we
were served drinks by beautiful
stewardesses.

The stewardesses really
weren’t that beautiful. It is hard
to describe them because they
changed so much. Itseemed the
further south we travelled, the
more militaristic they got. By
the time we landed in Quito,
Ecuador, the guys wheeling the
carts down the aisles had
machine guns and rocket
launchers strapped to their
belts.

There were other differences
too. Charles had to convince his
father that the Beagle was a
safe ship, that the captain and
crew were fit, and that he would
not be speared by some savage

Phi interview

Wilson shapes agenda through feedback

By WILLIAM ROBERTS
Editor-in-Chief

Washington and Lee’s new
president, Dr. John D. Wilson,
said in an interview Friday that
the question of coeducation for
W&L is an important one and
one we should consider very
carefully. Wilson also gave his
views on the fraternity system,
drugs on campus, the faculty

‘and curriculum, university
housing, and Black enrollment
at W&L.

“I came to Washington and
Lee in January without any
special preoccupation with the
question of coeducation,”’
Wilson said. “I had discussed
the question with the Board of
Trustees and I said that I ad-
mire the Board’s decision not to
joina fad.”

In 1976, the Board of Trustees
voted not to allow W&L to go
coeducational after an in-depth
study of the matter.

“‘T think it is a terribly impor-
tant question and I think it is
something that is on a lot of peo-
ple’s minds,” Wilson said.
“This is the kind of thing that
you have to take your time
about.”

Wilson said that he has re-

ceived numerous letters from
alumni expressing opinions and
asking questions about coedu-
cation. He gave the Rintum Phi
copies of some of the cor-
respondence, (Please see page
three. )

Wilson emphasized that it is
not he who is raising the ques-
tion of coeducation again; say-
ing that he merely reflects the
feelings of alumni, faculty, ad-
ministrators and students by
responding to their comments.

“The ‘Baby Boom’ carried us
for a while, but the demo-
graphics have changed,”’
Wilson said. According to a
report prepared for the Board
of Trustees meeting on May 21,
the ‘‘population of 18 year-old
students will decline from 3.1 to
2.4 million (26 percent) between
1979 and 1994.”

‘Assuming, one, we are able
to hold our present position be-
tween now and 1992, two, the
economy and the federal finan-
cial aid picture remain clear,
and three, we will expect to
enroll a class in 1992 compara-
ble to 199@,_ then the Class of 1996
should ber no more than
265,” the report concluded.

The University Register of
Faculty, Staff and Students lists

363 freshman enrolled in 1982
for the Class of 1986. Wilson in-
dicated that these expectations
raise questions about the Uni-
versity’s policy regarding ad-
mission of women.

eBlack students at W&L

Wilson said he has been talk-
ing to people on campus about
the problems faced by Black
students at Washington and
Lee. ‘‘I have talked with Johnny
White, Dean of Minority Af-
fairs, about some of the pro-
blems of Black students, but I
have got to get with the students
themselves,”’ Wilson said. ‘I’ve
been invited to go and talk to
SABU just to get to know
them.”’

“I think the Black students
have a much tougher time than
white students because the
women’s schools do not have
many Blacks either,’ Wilson
said.

“TI really do hope we can
bridge the communication gap
so all students at Washington
and Lee can participate fully,”
Wilson said. ‘‘I think it is a task
we have to face here in America
and I think we can do it well ina
small, residential community.”’

Wilson also cited the excellent
academic record of Black stu-

dents at W&L. ‘‘We have to do
all we can to insure that con-
tinues and remove all the ar-
tificial impediments,” he said.
eThe Faculty and Curriculum

Wilson said that in
academics, there should be a
balance between scholarly
work and teaching. ‘I think the
University has achieved an ex-
tensively healthy balance be-
tween scholarly work and
teaching.”

‘“‘As a model, we have a per-
son who has a scholarly interest
in a subject, contributes to the
development of that subject,
and yet is able to communicate
it to young minds in the class-
room, and is accessible to
them,”’ Wilson said.

“I do think that, in the short-
run, we need to develop our cur-
riculum in computer science,”
Wilson said. ‘‘The math depart-
ment is obliged to rethink its in-
troductory courses and how stu-
dent enrollment patterns turn
out under the new curriculum
program.”’ The new curriculum
requirements passed by the
faculty this year will require
students to earn 10 credits in
mathematics and _ labaratory
sciences instead of the present-

W&L endures ,..

By ALLEN S. ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

Often we most fully understand our institutions
when we step outside them and consider their aspect
objectively.

On the eve of graduation, this applies to Washington
and Lee, which is sometimes sharply criticized for its
closely-held traditions and the comfort many of its
students enjoy. The nickname of ‘‘Mink’’ is not inap-
propriate for much of the student body, who are for-
tunate enough to wear fine threads and drive finely-
crafted cars. But these luxuries are more the hard-
earned fruits of successful parents’ labors than the
mark of haughty affluence.

In our capitalist society, the material manifesta-
tions of wealth are accorded more significance than
the educational advantages of a well-endowed univer-
sity. During his 14-year tenure as University Presi-
dent, Robert E. R. Huntley managed a 10-year cam-
paign that garnered $67 million in support of this
university’s purpose. The official articulation of that
goal is two-fold:

1) “The dedication of all its

resources to the development
of man’s capacity and desire to
learn, to understand, and to
pass on to others the varied
benefits of this intellectual
growth.”
2) “The pursuit of its educa-
tional purpose in a climate of
learning that stresses the im-
portance of the individual, his
personal honor and integrity,
his harmonious relationship
with his fellow man, and his
responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his
training and his talent.”

It is not until we have left the classroom and
entered the job market that these amorphous aspira-
tions take shape and full impact on our sensibilities.
We need not be alumni returning for our twentieth
class reunion, however, to feel a sense of missed op-
portunities and underdeveloped friendships. These
regrets surface as soon as we have taken the last ex-
am of our college career. Having cleared the books
from our library carrel, their weight is offset by ex-
hiliration as we make our last necessary trek down
“‘the hill.”’

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for the Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the Editor-in-Chief and Business Manager, but the Ring-tum
Phi is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in the Ring-tum Phi office, room 206 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Monday of the week they are to be run. This newspaper
observes current court definitions of libel and obscenity.

But even as we feel the vertigo of accomplishment
and the promise of a career, few of us escape Sartre’s
anguish of free will and its responsibilities.

A sheepskin mask is lifted, and we see the resources
we have left untapped in preparation for our frighten-
ing leap from dependent student to self-reliant in-
dividual.

The breadth and accessibility of these resources
here is strikingly high for such a small university.
This is a fortunate disproportion that spurs our minds
when the last grades are in. We may remember that
history course we never worked into our tight
schedule. We might wish we had attended more CON-
TACT lectures or spent more time rapping with that
especially wizened professor. Suddenly the library
looms vast and magnificent, and the colonnade takes
on new splendor. We pause to take in the silence of the
campus. We finally read the plaque our hurried steps
wore thin, and we feel the solidity of the benches and

the trees.

Solid and enduring. This is the quality of W&L
which money alone will not ensure. The same oppor-
tunities existed a century ago, and will again call to
be embraced as many years from now. And students
will still rush through the academic and social
gauntlet of Washington and Lee, intent on achieving
their manhood one warm June afternoon. When they
do feel that weight of responsibility in a scroll of
distinction, the anonymous faces and unread books
will still flash before their eyes.

Only the individual student can decide how deeply
he will plunge his head and hands into W&L’s
resources. We can only hope that tradition will sus-
tain the opportunity, and that vision will keep its
shape in tune with changing times.

Streiff and Hall win Fulbrights

Two Washington and Lee
University seniors — Scott W.
Hall of Danville, Va., and
Michael Streiff of Gainesville,
Fla. — have been awarded
Fulbright Scholarships for
graduate study in Europe.

Both Hall and Streiff will use
their scholarships to study in
Germany.

Hall, a chemistry major at
Washington and Lee, will be
studying at the Institute for
Neurobiology in Julich where
he will work under a biochemist
who is conducting research on
vision. Hall has already been
accepted to the Univeristy of
Virginia’s medical school and
will begin his studies there in
1984.

At W&L, Hall has been an
honor roll (3.5 or above grade-
point average on a 4.0 scale)
student. He won the Phi Beta
Kappa Sophomore Award and

the James Lewis Howe Award
in chemistry. He is a member of
Alpha Epsilon Delta, the
premedical fraternity.

A graduate of George
Washington High School, Hall is
the son of Dr. and Mrs. Jack W.
Hall of Danville.

Streiff, a biology major, plans
to use his Fulbright Scholarship
to study microbiology at
the Pettenkopfer Institute in

Munich. He has been accepted
to medical school at the Univer-
sity of Florida and will enter
there in 1984.

At W&L, Streiff has been an
honor roll student and was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He is
a member of the Alpha Epsilon
Delta premedical fraternity.

Streiff is a graduate of
Buckholz High School. He is the
son of Dr. and Mrs. Richard R.
Streiff of Gainesville.

Alumnus
questions

Wilson on

 

coeducation

 
   

 

Editor’s Note: This letter was
sent to President Wilson by a
W&L Alumnus in November
while Wilson was still Provost at
VPI.

Dear Dr. Wilson:
As a graduate of the Class of
1953 (College) and of the Class
of 1955 (Law), I send you my
hardiest congratulations on
your election as President of
Washington and Lee.

Since we have never met (I
certainly hope to meet you
soon) it is perhaps presump-
tuous of me to ask a favor of
you, but my request is not just
for me but for your daughter,
Sara, and my _ daughter,

 
   
 

 
  

 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

Morgan, and all the other bright
young women in this world. My
request is that when you next
meet with the Board of Trus-
tees, ask them why Washington
and Lee discriminates against
the admission of women to
Washington and Lee. Ask them
why your daughter, Sara, is not
eligible for admission to
Washington and Lee. Ask them
why their daughters, grand-
daughters and nieces are not
eligible for admission to
Washington and Lee.

Fortunately, our daughters, if
qualified, can attend Yale, Har-
vard, Stanford, . Princeton,
Michigan State, West Point, An-
napolis and every other college
and university in the United
States except for Washington
and Lee, VMI and, I am told, on-
ly three other colleges.

By now, you have probably
heard a great deal about the
character of Robert E. Lee. By
all accounts, he was intelligent,
compassionate and endowed
with a mind that was willing to
adjust to changing situations.
Ask the Washington and Lee
Board whether they think that
General Lee, if alive today,
would discriminate against the
admission of women to Wash-
ington and and Lee.

Wilson’s agenda

ly required six credits. Wilson
also said the University will
take a close look at the engi-
neering and applied physics
programs.

Regarding a replacement for
Dean of the College William J.
Watt, who is resigning as Dean
to resume full time teaching of
chemistry at the end of next
year, Wilson said, ‘‘a search
committee has been named and
is seeking nominations across
the country.”’

The members of the search
committee are; Dr. H.L.
Boetsch, Dr. S.M.B. Coulling,
Dr. D.G. Elmes, Dr. A.C. Gor-
don, Dr. J.K. Jennings, Dr.
W.L. Sessions, Dean P.H. Simp-
son, Ph.D., Dr. E.W. Spencer,

and Dr. H.T. Williams, with Dr. |

Wilson as the chairman.

“We hope to make a decision
by next fall and get it to the
Board of Trustees for their
meeting in Febuary,” Wilson
said.

eThe Fraternity System

“‘T am not happy with the long
standing practice of the frater-
nities housing sophomores on-
ly,” Wilson said. ‘‘How is it
possible to have a strong in-
dependent fraternity system
with only sophomores living in
the houses?’’

“‘T share the faculty’s concern
about the weakening of the in-
tegrity of the academic week,”’
Wilson said.’ ‘‘Not just Wednes-
day night parties, but we also
have Cockpit parties on Tues-
days, and there is quite a bit of
travel back and forth.”

“I’m not blaming the frater-
nity guys for this,’’ he said. “I
think it is part of the cycle
developing in the Valley.”

“There is nothing wrong with
young people getting together in
the middle of the week,” he
said. ‘But Wednesday night
parties go on too late, people
drink too much and then drive.”

Wilson said he objects to the
“intensity of the thing, when
you have a house jammed with
people and a band with all the
trappings of a weekend party.”

“IT am interested in talking
with the fraternities informally
on this,” Wilson said.

“I think to have Rush at the
first of the year is terrible,
though I haven’t experienced it
here. I have seen it in other
places,”’ he said. “‘I think it is
just not right to plunge fresh-
men into intense social life
before they get their academic
feet on the ground.”

*University Housing

“‘T really want to look careful-
ly at our residential character,”
Wilson said. ‘‘Right now I think
we need more University hous-
ing.”

“In a University of 1700
students, we are housing 600.
That is only 35 percent,’ he
said. “The idea of W&L sug-
gests that we ought to be hous-
ing more.”’

“All I’m interested in is hav-
ing more people live in town
who can take part in the co-
curricular life,” Wilson said.
“There are lots of things going
on in the University and it is
hard for guys living in the coun-
try to contribute.”

¢Student Drug Use

In a recent crackdown by
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘“‘John’’ Read, two
Washington and Lee students
have been arrested and charged
with possesion of cocaine with
intent to distribute.

“I’ve talked to both of these
fellows who are now facing
charges of possession with in-
tent to distribute and I told
them that I want to get to know
them as people and find out
what had gotten them into the
position in their lives where
they face prison sentences for
the alleged activity,” Wilson
said.

“T look upon the distribution
of drugs for profit with horror
and I find it appalling, and cer-
tainly I find it inimical to the
health of the University,’’ he
said. ‘‘The policy of the Univer-
sity distinguishes between the
use of and the distribution of
drugs in terms of the severity of
the penalty,’ but it is all il-
legal.”

“There is a certain myopia
we have when we talk about
these things,’ Wilson said. “I
hear from’ knowledgeable
sources that alcohol abuse is a
bigger problem in American
colleges than marijuana.”

“T had a feeling at VPI, when
a dean said, ‘Alcohol is our
number one problem,’ of relief.
This was something familiar,
not beannies or reddies. But
there is no reason to be reliev-
ed,” Wilson said.

“The University is not a sanc-
tuary if there is a warrant and
sufficient cause for investiga-
tion,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘But this is a
community built on trust and
mutual respect and there are
certain circles of privacy in-
volved.”

But, ‘“‘the University is part of
a large society. It subscribes to
the society’s laws,”’ he said.

e Wilson is confident

“I’ve been here five months
and I’ve raised certain ques-
tions about problems I see,” he
said. ‘‘But that does not mean I
don’t have great confidence in
this place.”

“T feel a genuine sense of
privilege in being part of it and I
hope I can contribute some-
thing,’’ Wilson said.

President Wilson’s reply of
‘December, 1982.
(Editor’s note: This is President
Wilson’s reply to the letter from
the alumnus.)

Dear Sir,

You fully anticipate, I’m
sure, my unwillingness to speak
clearly on the issue of coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee
before I’ve had a chance to live
and work in the community for
awhile. There are things about
the experience of the university
‘that cannot merely be read
| about or talked about. One must
try to get a feel for these things,
the valuable ones and the less
useful ones, too. And this is not
likely to come fully to me until I
am in office and meet more peo-
ple and sense something of the
rhythm of the place. But I will
say these preliminary things at
this stage, as much to clarify
my own perceptions as for any
other reason.

1) I admire the earlier deci-
sions of the Board of Trustees
mainly on the ground that co-
education conversions were be-
ing shabbily rationalized all
over the land in the early seven-
ties (on the specious grounds of
‘naturalism’ or because of ill-
thought-through notions about
the psychology of learning). To
have declared that the universi-
ty had not done badly by its
students over the past two cen-
turies was very much worth do-
ing. I also admire a Board will-
ing to risk running against the
tide...and it was most certainly
a tide!

2) That having been said, I
must also say that the assump-
tion that co-education was a fad
and would be one day be written
off as a temporary aberration,
no longer looks very good. The
demise of the single-sex college
for men is now a given. VMI and
the Citadel are special cases.
Wabash, Hampden-Sydney, and
Washington and Lee may be,
but I do not now know that, i.e. I
don’t know how each is special
and whether they are alike or
different in being special.

 

  

  

Wilson’s thoughts on coeducation

3) The college for men did not
arise from any special theory of
pedagogy. It assumed its
character from the dominant
shape and mores of the society.
It was, as we know, a society
that did not universally believe
in the importance of educating
women. Why should it have
been otherwise? Women did not
vote (ie. were not truly
citizens) and did not enter the
learned professions. When the
women’s colleges came along in
the nineteenth century, most of
them rationalized their founda-
tions on the ground that
educated men needed equally
well educated wives as
helpmates. Citizenship and the
professions came later still. To-
day our society, and all western
societies, see the matter very
differently. This does not
negate the value of the very
good and very interesting in-
stitutions that arose under the
old dispensation. But it does im-
pose upon them the burden of
rationalizing their single-sex
character when the social props
have been kicked out from
under them.

4) It is probably true to say
that Washington and Lee is only
half-hearted in its devotion to
its single-sex character. I
discover no militancy on the
question. The most thoughtful
simply say that the advocates of
change of this sort should carry
the burden of predicting how
the change will make the
university better. This is a good
and hard position, for it un-
covers the truth about change:
in fact, we cannot accurately
predict the future, though we
can make good guesses.

5) Washington and Lee’s lack
of militancy on the question can
be discovered in the number of
women currently enrolled, full-
time, in the University. I refer
not only to the Law School
where there are many female
candidates for the university’s
degree, but also to the
undergraduate programs
where many special students
are enrolled for periods as long

 

    

as a full academic year. They
are denied candidacy for the
baccalaureate degree, the only
explicit discouragement to their
presence I can point to. Their
presence in the university’s
classrooms and on the playing
fields, however, makes more
difficult the defense of the prac-
tice of denying them candidacy
for the baccalaureate degree.
Or so it seems to me at the mo-
ment.

6) The practical questions
associated with co-education
are not trivial ones and warrant
careful thought. I do not believe
a decision to admit women
would necessarily involve
enlarging the size of the univer-
sity. But it most certainly would
entail residence hall space,
athletic accomodations and ad-
ditions or changes in staff (in
the Dean of Students’ Office, in
the Infirmary, in the coaching
staff, etc., etc.) These are not
impediments, mind you, but
necessities that would require
planning and explicit funding.

There are, I am sure, dozens
of things I’ve not thought of or
have chosen not to mention. I do
believe the Washington and Lee
community is currently willing
and able to take up a significant
question of this sort without
chasing false rabbits (e.g. will
women graduates support the
annual fund?) and without all
the posturing that occurred
elsewhere back in the seventies.
It can do so because it has the
confidence that comes from
centuries of successful service
and because the place is healthy
and under no current pressure
from admissions or OCR to ‘do
something.’ I’m also pretty con-
fident that the alumni loyalty is
so deeply grounded that one
would not have to worry about
widespread alienation. These
are the qualities that attracted
me in the first place and I look
forward, more than I can say, to
my move, in January, to Lee
House.

Biology professor retires

after 40 years

By STEVE GEARY
and
JIM McCABE
Specials-to-the-Phi

Dr. James Holt Starling will
be retiring as Professor of
Biology from Washington and
Lee University in June 1983.
Professor Starling received his
B.S. and M.S. degrees from the
University of Alabama and his
Ph.D. from Duke University,
where his dissertation involved
ecological and  taxonomical
studies of pauropods of the
Duke forest. Dr. Starling joined
Washington and Lee’s faculty in
1942 and became chairman of
the Premedical Committee in
1963. While at Washington and
Lee, he taught Vertebrate Com-
parative Anatomy and General

We landed on an old United
States World War II airstrip in
our Boeing 727. The United
States defended Panama from
Japan with help from troops
stationed on the Galapagos, and
after the war, the United States
tried to lease the islands from
Ecuador, but they turned us
down.

Last Thursday, Dr. ‘‘Jim”’
Starling was the honoree of a
cocktail party at the Lee House
followed by a dinner in Evans
dining Hall. The evening’s
events were planned in conjunc-
tion with the Biomedical Ethics
Institute held on the following
Friday and Saturday. Of the
over 680 health professions
alumni invited, approximately
35 medical alumni returned to
participate in the joint ac-
tivities along with current
students and faculty. W&L’s
President John D. Wilson spoke
on the developing need for the
formal study of ethics and
morality. He traced the
development of this need from
the scientific revolution, which
began a diversion of man’s em-
phasis on the humanities,
through recent events, Vietnam
and Watergate, that have
undermined our trust in
American government. Presi-
dent Wilson stated his belief
that W&L possesses an at-

There is a saying in the
Galapagos that you’ve got to be
crazy to live there. The longer
you are there the more you
believe it.

This year the people aren’t
the only wierd things in the
Galapagos. El Nino, the mass of
warm water and air off the
coast of Central America sits
over the islands. El Nino really
isn’t weird; it usually shows up
every year or so about Christ-
mas time, hence its name which
means, ‘‘the boy child.” It

development of ethical conduct.
He noted that the Honor System
allows for such an atmosphere
by dealing with transgressions
in an uncompromising and
severe manner. President
Wilson concluded his address
by pointing out that Dr. Starling
has been a leader and teacher of
ethical conduct by his own liv-
ing example.

The Galapagos are desert
islands. During the breeding
season of the galapagos mock-
ingbird two years ago, two inch-
es of rain fell. From January to
April this year there has been
more than 43 inches.

Birds aren’t breeding, and
small fish at the beginning of

nutrients remain at the bottom
when the warm E] Nino is on

Plants survive on the ar-

preached that, ‘‘The sooner one
can face death, the sooner one
can begin to live life and enjoy
it.”’ Dr. Starling, or ‘“‘Jimbo”’ as
he calls himself in class, will
always be remembered by his
former students. He has the
natural abilities to cut through
the faculty-student gap and,
over the years, to bridge the
generation gap in an effort to
get to know his students.

A couple years ago Galapagos
researchers finished one of the
most important studies in
evolution since Darwin’s Origin
of Species. They concluded that

evolution usually takes steps |

much more rapidly than
previously thought; populations
can change dramatically in
several generations under cer-
tain conditions. They studied
Darwin's finches during several
dry: years when finches suited
for dry weather flourished.
Researchers returned to study
the effect of the dry weather on
the finches, and E] Nino hit.

The islands are perfect for
studying evolution: they are
isolated-virtually no animals
migrate or are imported there,
and if they do show up, they are
easily recognized; human in-
terference is carefully control-
led; and, it is very cheap for
researchers to live there. You
can buy a lobster dinner for
$1.25, and you can mail letters
with nostamps.

Whalers set up a post office on
Floreana Island in the 18th cen-
tury. They put a barrel on a post
and called it The Barrel Post
Office. Sailors would leave mail
in the barrel and passing ships
would stop to check the barrel
and pick up mail on their route.
The island became a major
stopping point for ships in the

South Pacific.

Whalers also hunted tor-
toises. The Galapagos Islands
were named after the giant tor-
toises that roam the islands.
Tortoises were valuable cargo
for a ship because they could be
stacked below deck for more
than a year with no food or
water and still remain alive.
The whalers swiped tens of
thousands of tortoises.

The Cachalote, a 60-foot steel-
hulled sailer powered by a
powerful Caterpillar diese!
waited for us at the bottom of
Alcedo, and it motored us from
island to island as we watched
birds, iguanas, and tortoises.

We hiked up Alcedo Volcano
and camped on its rim for two
days. A group of students from
Galapagos III were seriously
lost for a couple of days as they
descended to the shore.

The islands are volcanic.

‘ They rose from the depths of the

Pacific as lava oozed between
plates shifting on the ocean
floor. Moray eels, usually
hiding in crevices in rocks and
coral, cruise around like fish in
the Galapagos. We dove with
the eels and the sea lions mock-
ing us and our clumsy scuba
gear as they’d glide effortlessly
down hundreds of feet as we
watched.

We returned to the States on a
727. The stewardesses returned
to normal, and we could drink
the water again.
