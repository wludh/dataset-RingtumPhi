Since the era of the Vietnam
War, American college cam-
puses have not seen the intellec-
tual student activism of the ’60s
that is now reappearing with
the development of the nuclear
freeze issue.

The student Caucus on Peace
and War in Richmond has been
compared to the student ac-
tivist groups of the radical ’60s
decade. The Caucus is an
organization of Virginia Com-

’ monwealth University students
and they are angry and resolv-
ed.

“We support non-military
solutions to political conflict
and we sponsor educational and
political programs to further
this goal. The group supports
the Nuclear Weapons Freeze
Campaign as a sensible first
step in a disarmament move-
ment,” proclaims a Caucus
flyer distributed on the VCU
campus.

On Monday, Nov. 22, Presi-
dent Reagan appeared on na-
tional television to announce his
decision to support a ‘‘dense
pack” basing mode for the pro-
posed MX missiles. The peace
group’s reaction was one of im-
mediate condemnation.

Caucus leaders convened
Tuesday night after Reagan’s
announcement, for a routine

VCU students rally

organizational meeting. It was
a calm group that met. There
was no hype, no fanaticism.
Their comments on Reagan
were made with cool deter-
mination.

“His numbers were all
wrong,’ Bob Holsworth, a
young professor of political
science at VCU and a member
of the Caucus, said. ‘‘Reagan
shouldn’t be giving out that sort
of misinformation under the
guise of being a sort of
educator.”’

Reagan used a series of video
bar graphs indicating the
number of American missiles in
comparison with the number of
Russian missiles to support his
contention that the Soviets have
a dangerous advantage. Actual-
ly the signifigant measure of
advantage or balance between
the two powers is in the number
of warheads deployed by each
country. The United States and
the Soviet Union maintain equal
destructive power in about 7,500
warheads each.

The idea behind the dense
pack basing of the MX is that
the missiles cannot all be im-

mediately destroyed by a Rus-

sian first strike. America would
be able to respond with the MX,
assuring a mutual destruction
of both countries. The Russians
would therefore be deterred
from attacking us

‘That is insane stuff, you

know, ‘If they shoot enough
rockets at us to blow up half the
U.S., we could still respond with
a dense pack,’’’ Kevin Zetena, a
VCU English student, said at
the meeting.

“It is insane,” George Young,
a veteran of the American war
in South-East Asia, said.
“Everybody is talking freeze
and Reagan is talking more
bombs, I saw enough bombs in
Vietnam.”’

Caucus members were in-
censed by Reagan’s mis-
representation of the strategic
weapons balance and by what
they see as an absurdity in the

logic of nuclear deterrent. As
students, they want to do
something about the arms race
and that is why they have
organized the Peace Caucus.

The group is trying to
generate political support of a
freeze on further development,
testing or deployment of
strategic nuclear weapons.
They are selling T-shirts, which
are white with a green tree on
the front and boast the slogan,
“All living things, Richmond
Nuclear Freeze Campaign.”

In early November, a 560 ft.
rope, almost the length of two
football fields, was stretched

EC freezes Contact

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously to freeze the
funds of the Contact public
speaker subcommittee at its
meeting Monday night.

This move was prompted by
the absence of a Contact repre-
sentative at the meeting, to pre-
sent Contact’s monthly report
as scheduled. Both President
Bennett Ross and Vice presi-
dent Morgan Griffith said that
they had intended to discuss
Contact’s performance.

The freezing of funds is not an
unusual punishment. Every

club which received funds from
the EC is required to make
reports periodically. If they fail
to do this, their funds may be
frozen until a report is made.

The Student Bar Association
was present for its report.
Treasurer Fred Earley report-
ed that its film series may be
scrapped due to low demand
Also, The Res Ipsa, the six:
month overdue law yearbook,
had been sent to the publishers.
Earley commented that this
year’s boek will probably be
produced as a soft-back editio1
of The Law News.

’60s-style to ban the bomb

across the VCU campus in
downtown Richmond. The rope
was symbolic of the Navy’s new
Trident submarine, which is 560
feet long and carries 408 in-
dependently targetable nuclear
warheads each capable of .
destroying a city of 100,000 per-
sons. Tied to the rope were 408
ribbons representative of the
warheads. The Peace Caucus
asked, ‘‘How much is enough?”’

“If you believe it’s time to
stop this futile and dangerous
arms race, then: sign the freeze
petition; become a member of
our group and work for peace,”’
they then said.

Steve Perry, business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi

explained that problems with
papers reaching students’ par-
ents were out of his control.

‘“‘We send the paper bulk rate,
which means if they’ve got

Letters

Dear Editor:

This will be short and to the
point. I totally agree with John
Vlahoplus’ motion to ‘“‘castigate
the chairman of Contact’’ for
not publicizing the recent Con-
tact speaker, William
Schaufele.

I don’t even know who the
Chairman of Contact is, but that
doesn’t matter. When a speaker
is brought to campus whether
he be famous or not, Contact
has the responsibility to make
the student body aware of his
presence. I didn’t even know
that Mr. Schaufele was speak-
ing, and yes, I would like to
have heard him. —

I hope this letter speaks for
most of the student body. We
are paying for those speakers,
and I for one would like to know
when they are on campus.

Thank you,
Claf Hall
(Class of 1985)

 

Dear Editor:

Over the past eleven weeks, I
have been witness to a sight
that I hope isn’t a sign of a trend
that will continue through the
winter term. I am referring toa
record low attendance on Tues-
day nights in the Cockpit!! I
have worked every Tuesday
night since the beginning of last
year. I can honestly say that the
crowds were more enthusiastic
and larger than they are this
year. If it was such a great pro-
gram last year — what happen-
ed? We packed a full house
every week! There have been
only four instances in which we
have filled the Cockpit this
year. That’s not bad, a 30 per-
cent success rate.

I hope that everyone realizes
that unless the patronage of the
W&L community, which in-
cludes Sweet Briar, Hollins,
Southern Seminary, Mary
Baldwin and Randolph-Macon,
increases in both quantity and
enthusiasm, the consequences

could be devastating. What
would happen if there were no
more Tuesdays in the Pit?

In my opinion the quality of
the music has been equal to,
and in some cases, superior to
that of last year. It shouldn’t be
the case that if you have never
heard of a band, you don’t
come. The SAB has done a great
job in the quality of the bands
they have booked, and the
bands for the winter term
(maybe) are of the same
calibre.

A small note should be added
here that the majority of the
Cockpit crowd has been the
Seniors. I think that this may
say something. What? Please
take what I have said seriously.
However disjointed my
thoughts may appear(written
while at work), they express the
genuine concern of a pessi-
mistic Senior. We have no

pavillion. We need our
Tuesdays.

Sincerely,

Rich Weissman

On Elmer Fudd and opening day

By SCOTT BROOM
Special to the Phi

I questioned my sanity as I
reached to turn on the light and
rolled out of bed.

The alarm clock I had just
slammed into silence read 4:40
a.m. But as I excitedly drove
myself south through the pre-
dawn darkness on county Route
611 I noticed kitchen lights
burning in almost every farm-
house and men _ standing
around idling pick-up trucks
scraping frost from the win-
dows.

“Well, I can’t be insane if all
these guys are doing it too.’”’ I
thought. Of course, such ra-
tionalization might be diagnos-
ed by a psychologist as a mere
neurotic device to cover up my
deviant behavior.

My peers were still in bed.
Ah, but they, like the psycholo-
gist, are not deer hunters.

November 15 marked the
opening of Virginia’s deer
season and (according to
United Press International) of-
ficials estimated 200,000 would-
be Nimrods took to the woods.
State game officials also ex-
pected a record harvest of up to
80,000 deer.

Despite such predictions, I,
like multitudes of other hopeful
Elmer Fudd impersonators got
skunked on Monday. I didn’t
even see a doe.

“Record harvest,” I thought
in disgust, as I thrashed my
way through heavy mountain
laurel somewhere on a ridge top
near the Botetourt County line
miles from the car. The view up
there was fantastic, but I
couldn’t see a thing. You see,
God designed mountain laurel
to be around seven feet tall so
the twigs poke you in the eyes,
and to grow so thick that pro-
gress through it is nearly im-
possible. Deer love to hide in
moutain laurel.

Statewide, as on the Botetourt
County line, vicious wind com-
bined with the cold to make sit-
ting motionless on a deer stand
unbearable. I had to retreat
from my perch overlooking a
prime piece of deer habitat. The
wind also delivered my nause-
ating body odor to every wary
nose for at least a quarter mile.
So I joined the many hunters for
the long hike back to the car and
warmth.

I was disillusioned. I had
dreamt of at least 50 different

dramatic finales to my hunt.
Deer hunting is all macho
psyche-up. Now I was dribbling
from the nose like a child, tired
and sure I would die of hypo-
thermia if I didn’t keep moving.

Still, for those who came bet-
ter prepared with warm
clothes, experience and _ for-
titude, opening day was a re-
sounding success. Proprietors
who run game checking stations
noted high tallies for the day.

“Yeah, I was just cruising
through this ravine... and
there he was up on this ridge,”
said George Foresman, one of
my buddies from. work,
“and...and... Blam! Down
he went.” He bragged like a
perennial pro. I knew it was just
luck, but why ruin the excite-
ment. It was a good story and
worst of all, I wished I was tell-
ing it.

“Well, that’s one out of
80,000,”’ I thought. It was four in
the afternoon by then and I had
already formulated plans to
weasel out of class and be back
in the forest the next morning. I
was assuming the frostbite
would heal and pneumonia
would not set in for another day
or so.

Guest editorial

Racial prejudice lingers

as U.S. fools itself

By JOSEPH WHELAN III

These days, many individuals
and minority groups are blam-
ing Ronald Reagan for the
presently bad situation of Black
Americans and other minority
races. To blame the unemploy-
ment of blacks and minorities
solely on Reagan is unfair. In
fact, it is unfair to blame just
about any president running for
reelection for the racial pro-
blem that exists in America. No
single man can be responsible
for an attitude which has been
prevalent in our country for at
least the past 100 years. Over-
coming the color barrier as a
whole, must be the result of a
total but gradual commitment
on the part of every single
American citizen.

It is because this problem
silently slips into every aspect
of our lives that it must be con-
sidered the greatest problem
which has afflicted our nation
over the past one hundred
years. Of course there are other
social, economical, and
religious dilemmas which
abound in our modern society,
but none quite so bellicose as

- the difficulty we have had in

bridging the gap between black
and white. The gap still exists
today just as it was lucidly
flaunted more than one hundred
years ago.

For decades Americans have
been fooling themselves into
maintaining that discrimina-
tion based on race went out with
slavery. This common-held
opinion just adds to the crisis,
and if followed will ensure that
we will be fooling ourselves
forever. We have made the
mistake of thinking that we are
erasing the problem when in
fact the practices we have been
carrying on have been making
the situation more catas-
trophic. How can we say that
every man is equal under the
law when we find ourselves bus-
ing poor black children to better
‘public’? schools because the
children can’t receive as good
an education at their own

neighborhood schools? Is the
black man really free when he
can’t move into a certain sub-
division because he knows his
house will be vandalized? Is the
white man free when he is turn-
ed down for a job by an “‘equal
opportunity’”” employer who
hires a black man to fulfill a
quota? Is Affirmative Action
really considering the black
man as an equal? What is more
basic in this country than our
professed honoring of the con-
cept — equality of rights? Sure-
ly we could say that if this one
main theory has been violated
in our society then we definitely
have a big problem. Well, we do
have this problem, and its size
is gargantuan in dimension.
Racial prejudice is a daily
threat to the ‘‘fool-proofness”’ of
the equality of rights concept.
Perhaps the problem of color
barriers can be brought clearer
to view by examining the
philosophy of the noted
historian Charles Sumner.
Although our society has come
a long way in terms of the pro-
gress of black people since
Sumner’s time, his arguments
still ironically hold true today.
Sumner believed firmly that
even though blacks had been
given freedom on paper, the
white man still refused to ac-
tually grant blacks total equal
rights. If Sumner could see the
bigotry and prejudice that goes
on today, he would maintain
that, theoretically, we haven’t
progressed much in terms of
considering the black man an
equal since the days of slavery.
Charles Sumner once describ-
ed his view of justice by saying
“In the eye of the law there is
but one class, where all in-
terests, opinions, conditions,
and colors commingle in har-
mony — excluding none,
therefore comprehending. all.”
Let us all strive to attain this
“fone class.’’ For it will take the
sincere efforts of us all to
achieve this ultimate ideal. Let
us all contribute to the cause of
bringing a permanent halt to
the biggest problem in America
for the last one hundred years.

By ALLEN ROBERTS ings about which little was House stenographer Henry
Phi Staff Writer known, Butow began his Kannee. The installation of the

“This country is... ready to
pull the trigger if the Japs do
anything. I mean we won't stand
any nonsense, public opinion
won't. ..if they do some fool
thing.”

This is the private voice of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt in
the fall of 1940, heard in the
Library’s Northen Auditorium
in the fall of 1982. Two weeks
ago historian R. J. C. Butow
presented the story behind his
discovery of the FDR tapes and
the secret recording of 14 press
conferences and private con-
versations during Roosevelt’s
reelection campaign.

Though the tapes have been
available to researchers since
December of 1947 they were
made with primitive equipment
and no one had made an effort

to decipher the garbled and vir-.

tually unintelligible recordings
until 1978, when Professor
Butow visited the FDR Library
at Hyde Park in New York City.

Butow initially went to the
library to research the origins
of Roosevelt’s interest in the
Far East, and he soon tired of
“plodding through endless
documents.” Butow did not
know the tapes existed when he
facetiously asked the library’s
director and an _ archivist,
‘“‘When can I listen to the FDR
tapes?’’ When the director said
the audio-visual collection did
contain some obscure record-

diligent efforts to decipher the
tapes and help solve the enigma
of FDR.

The sleuthing historian, said
the original 1940 recordings
began to deteriorate in 1947 and
were dubbed onto 16 discs. To
protect the discs from ‘‘wear

and tear’’ the discs were later-

recorded on a master tape.
Butow had to decipher the
master tape, which was a se-
cond copy of poor original
recordings. A microphone plac-
ed in the lampshade of FDR’s
desk lamp captured the rustling
sounds of FDR’s morning paper
and the scratching of his pen,
but the voices of visitors to the
Oval Office were usually muf-
fled or unintelligible. The
master tape’s quality also suf-
fers from flaws in the original
soundtrack, deterioration and
poor re-recording procedures.

The transcripts of FDR’s
press conferences were readily
available, so Butow concen-
trated on the private conversa-
tions. After hearing the frank
and unrestrained comments
Roosevelt enjoyed in his private
discussions, Butow pursued an
explanation of how and why the
device was installed.

Though the tapes were made
38 years earlier, Butow followed
a torturous trail of hearsay to
an answer, relying on an 18-
year-old address to find Jack
Romagna, successor to White

     
     

taping device was Kannee’s
suggestion, Butow learned.

Butow assured the audience
in Northen Auditorium that the
President used the recorder on-
ly reluctantly and ‘‘never used
it to entrap anyone.’’ The tapes
reveal that FDR was acutely

- aware of a Japanese threat in

the Pacific, but Butow is con-
vinced that he was not “a
devious manipulator who saw
Pearl Harbor coming.’’ Butow
also said that Roosevelt was not
““‘pursuing.malevolent or Mach-
iavellian designs’ and that he
stopped using the recorder soon
after his reelection to an un-
precendented third term.

Butow explained that ‘‘Roose-
velt had played his cards so
close to his chest that no one
had ever seen his hand.” The
tapes made by an experimental
recorder on a trial run provide a
key to understanding the presi-
dent’s actions during a crucial
period in American history. The
newly-formed Axis Alliance
jeopardized our national securi-
ty just as Roosevelt was or-
chestrating his 1940 bid for a
third term in the Oval Office.
Now historians can hear the
resonant voice of the most
mysterious of presidents ‘‘jaun-
ty one moment, serious the
next, shrewd, confident, imper-
turbable under pressure,
always incommand.”

By RICHARD GREFE
W&L Film Society

The Washington and Lee Film
Society’s next presentation will
be a work from Poland, Man of

by Andrzej Wajda. The film will
be shown at 8 p.m. on Friday,
Dec. 3 and Saturday, Dec. 4 in
classroom A of Lewis Hall.
There is no charge for admis-
sion and the public is invited.

Man of Iron is a sequel to Wa-
jda’s 1977 film Man of Marble
(shown last year by the Film
Society), which traced the story
of a Polish laborer who was
made into an_ idealized
Stakhanovite hero by the Polish
government and then crushed
by that government when he
showed signs of rebelliousness.
In Man of Iron it is the son of this
laborer who becomes involved
in the 1980 Gdansk shipyard
workers’ strike and the rise of
the independent Solidarity
union.

In Man of Iron, the govern-
ment dispatches a journalist to
do a ‘‘smear” story of the
Solidarity leaders in order to

Wrestlers open with
H-S, Invitational

petitions. The Generals visit
rival Hampden-Sydney College
on Wednesday for a 7:30 p.m.
dual match and entertain seven
teams for the ninth annual W&L
Invitational on Saturday start-
ing at 10 a.m.

The Generals and Tigers

sity, York (Pa.) College, Get-
tysburg College, Hiram (Ohio)
College, W&L, and a W&L-VMI
mixed group will compete in the
Invitational, which features
double-elimination competition

 

in each of the ten standard
wrestling weight classes.

The Keydets are defending
Invitational: champions. Get-
tysburg placed second, Georgia
Tech third, York fourth, Camp-
bell fifth, and Hiram sixth last
December.

W&L’s line-up will be led by
junior captian Tim Valliere in
the 167-pound division, sopho-
more Jeff Dixon at 190, and
senior Carlton Peebles at
heavyweight.

Completing the Generals’ ten-
tative roster will be sophomore
Terry McWhorter in the 118
division, freshman Brian
Lifsted at 126, classmate Larry
Anker at 134, sophomore Wes

ODAC honors W&L stars

Members of the Washington
and Lee football and soccer
teams received recognition
from the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference when the small-
college league selected its All-
Conference awards on Tuesday,
Nov. 16.

The ODAC placed four Gener-
als on its All-Conference first-
team in football: senior running
back Chris Cavalline, senior
linebacker Ken Manganiello,
senior offensive tackle Andy
Foley and junior center Glenn
Kirschner.

Two Generals were named to
the 11-man All-Conference first-
team in soccer; senior forward
Brad Poorman and_ senior
defenseman Tad Renner.

Seven W&L players appeared
on the All-Conference second-
team in football: senior

receiver Jerry Thompson,
junior tight end Dave Judge,
senior placekicker Bill Devine,
junior guards Dan Seal and
Craig Reilly, junior linebacker
John Cole and senior safety
Marty Thomas.

Senior midfielder Mark Car-
duner received mention on the
All-Conference second-team in
soccer.

Cavalline, Foley, and
Kirschner made their second
straight appearance on the
first-team. The ODAC Player-
of-the-Year in 1981, Cavalline
completed his W&L career with
2086 yards rushing, a school
record 152 points, 764 yards
receiving on 62 catches, and a
34.8 average on 132 punts. Foley
was a four-year letterman and
three-year starter. Kirschner is
a three-year letterman and two-

year starter.

Manganiello, also a_ three-
year starter, anchored a W&L
defense which was tops in the
conference the past two sea-
sons. This fall he collected a
team-high 55 solo tackles in-
cluding 14 for losses totalling 89
yards.

The four standouts led W&L
to a 5-4 record, the third
straight winning mark under
fifth-year head coach Gary
Fallon.

Poorman fired in a team-high
10 goals as W&L completed an
8-3-2 campaign under seventh-
year head coach Rolf Piranian
and set a new team record for
most goals in a season (35).
Renner, a four-year starter,
earned his second straight first-
team citation. He and Carduner
served as captains this fall.

 

 

State swimming playoffs here

James Madison, Richmond,
Virginia Commonwealth and
VMI will visit Washington and
Lee this weekend as the Gener-
als’ swimming team hosts the
15th annual Virginia State
Championships beginning
Wednesday evening with pre-
liminary competition in one-
meter diving.

The 18-event meet continues
Thursday and Friday with pre-
liminary swims at noon and
finals at 7:30 p.m., and con-
cludes Saturday with prelim-
inaries at 10 a.m. and finals at
5:30 p.m.

eight-team championship meet
also held at W&L sees James
Madison as the favorite. “‘The
Dukes have improved greatly in
each of the past three seasons.
Their early-season times this
year indicate a continuation of
that trend. They have the
numbers and the quality in
those numbers necessary to
win.”

“Behind JMU it’s wide-open.
VCU has 12 quality freshmen;
Richmond is coming off dual
meet losses to VCU and W&L
and will be set on revenge, and
VMI has one of the best divers
in the state (Mark Roltsch) who
will be tested by JMU’s en-
tries.’’

And the Generals?

“The only finals W&L will
strive for will be academic
ones,” offers Remillard, refer-
ring to the university's exam
period which begins the follow-
ing weekend. ‘A demanding
championship schedule and
pending exams don’t mix well.
We'll have sparse participation
Thursday and Friday. As a
result we’ll probably not finish
as high as we’d like to nor as
high as our team’s quality
would dictate.”’

Chief W&L swimmers will be

junior Rand McClain in the

freestyle sprints, classmate
Tim Rock in distance freestyle,
freshman Tim Stanford in the
butterfly and individual medley
competitions, classmate Jay
Kendall in the backstroke, and
the 400-meter free relay entry
probably composed of McClain,
junior Gary Meyer, sophomore
Bobby Pearson and Stanford.
The State Championship
event is the final competition of
1982 for W&L, which will
resume action Jan. 14 with a
dual meet at James Madison.

WE&L sports highlights

By LEE NICHOLS
Phi Sports Editor

Although this article might
have been more appropriate
before the Thanksgiving holi-
day, there’s still time to take
stock of the fall sports season,
and in turn take a brief look at
the winter sports which are just
getting underway.

Overall, Washington and Lee
Varsity fall sports, which in-
clude football, water polo, cross
country and soccer, enjoyed
their finest seasons in recent
memory. Every team finished
the year above the .500 mark;
the combined winning percen-
tage for the four sports was .750
(48-16-2), an impressive record
by anyone’s standards.

Last year’s football Generals
went 82 and won the play-
offs, the team’s first such ti-
tle since entering ODAC.
At the start of the 1982 season
Coach Fallon and his players
held high hopes for defending
their conference title and gain-
ing a berth in the NCAA Divi-
sion III playoffs, an honor
denied them last year. Unfor-
tunately, the team was unable
to achieve these goals as they

settled for a 5-4 overall record, —
and 3-2 in the conference. |

However, this record must be
qualified; the Generals lost 2 of
their contests by a total of 4
points. Also, they were able to
maintain the transformation of
the W&L football program
under fifth year head coach
Gary Fallon by posting. their
third winning season in a row.
Following regular season play,
four players received All-
Conference first team honors,
while seven others were chosen
for the second team.

The W&L polo team continued
its winning ways under the
direction of fourth year head
coach Page Remillard. The
Generals posted a 25-7 record in
regular season play, including a
flawless 13-0 record in Southern
League Competition. Although
the team was edged out by the
Richmond Spiders in the Virgin-
ia State Championships, they
avenged this defeat by
thrashing their rival 13-7 in the
finale of the Southern League
Championship en route to cap-
turing the title for the second
straight year. The Generals
ended the season on a frustrat-
ing note, finishing seventh of
eight teams in the Eastern

Championships, with a mere 11
seconds preventing at least a
third place showing in the
event.

The W&L cross country team
had a particularly fine season,
as the harriers won the ODAC
Championship for the first time
in its seven year history; the
squad’s excellent season earned
Head Coach Dick. Miller honors
as the Conference Coach-of-the-
year, his first such accolade in
31 years at the Generals’ helm.
Two W&L runners earned All-
Conference honors for their per-
formance in the conference
meet. The team finished with a
dual meet record of 10-2, which
tied a cross country record for
most victories in one season.
Against strong competition, the
Generals took fourth place of 11
teams in the NCAA Division III
South Regional meet.

Head Coach Rolf Piranian
and his players achieved the
goals they set at the beginning
of the season as they compiled
an 8-3-2 mark for the regular
season. The Generals were
competitive in conference play,
posting a 3-1-2 mark which in-
cluded a tie with favored Lynch-
burg College, and finished in a
tie for second in the conference.
Although the team _ will
graduate five starters, Piranian
points out that the team has a
strong group of underclassmen
who will take up the slack next
year.

Looking ahead, the winter
holds promise for a continua-
tion of the winning tradition at
W&L. The basketball team is
coming off a 21-7 record last
year, good for a second place
finish in ODAC regular season

play; likewise, the team finish-

ed second in the ODAC tourna-
ment. The Generals are return-
ing four of five starters from
last year’s team, and have six
returning lettermen on the
bench to provide the necessary
depth. Head Coach Verne Can-
field indicates that fans can
look for ‘‘three guard offenses,
line-up combinations, and
multiple defenses’’ this coming
season, as he looks to career
victory number 300 (his record

now stands at 293-168). The
team’s major goals, according
to Canfield, are 20 victories, na-
tional ranking, conference title,
and a bid to the NCAA playoffs.
The team was overlooked by the
selection committee last winter
despite its impressive record.
In action this far the Generals
are 1-2. Seniors Brian Hanson,
Frank Eppes, and Jay Fechtal
will serve as captains for the
squad.

Wrestling Head Coach Gary
Franke will be relying on
freshmen to fill the lower
weight classes as the grapplers
take to the mats this coming
season. Franke has starters
returning at 142, 167, 177, 190
and heavyweight from last
year’s 8-6 squad; the team is
rather ‘‘top-heavy.’’ The
wrestlers open the season with
a dual match at rival Hampden-
Sydney -on Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. The Generals defeated H-S
twice last season. Junior Tim
Valliere is captain of this year’s
squad.

The W&L swim team will try
to maintain its perfect record of
nine appearances in nine con-
secutive NCAA Division III
Championships. Head Coach
Page Remillard has six let-
termen who competed in the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ships returning from last year’s
squad, as only two swimmers
were lost to graduation. In 1981
the Generals finished fifth in an
eight team field at the state
meet, and ninth out of 49 teams
at the NCAA Division III meet.
Highlights of this year’s season
include the UNC-Wilmington
“Seahawk” Invitational in mid-
February as well as the Virgin-
ia State Championships and the
NCAA Championships. Juniors
Tim Rock and Rand McClain
will captain the W&L team for
the 1982-83 season.

So far this year W&L teams
have compiled winning records
that we can be proud of. Let’s
give basketball, wresting, and
swimming the support they
need and deserve in the coming
months.

  
 
 
 
  
  

 

 

 

Cagers finish
1982 at home

Three home games during the
next week will conclude the 1982
portion of the schedule for the
Washington and Lee basketball
team.

. The Generals, 1-2 after
Tuesday’s loss at Hampden-
Sydney College, will entertain
Shenandoah College tonight
Dec. 2, Averett College on Mon-

_day the 6th, and Catholic

University on Wednesday the
8th. All games will begin at 7:30

p.m.

Head coach Verne Canfield
labels the three opponents as
‘“‘challenging.’”’.Shenandoah, 1-2
prior to a Tuesday home game,
possesses one of the state’s bet-
ter small-college players in
senior forward Soni Brown.
Averett is ‘reportedly better
than last year when they beat us
by a point at their place,” and
Catholic is an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference newcomer
which posted a surprising one-
point win over Hampden-
Sydney two weeks ago.

W&L’s 1-2 record includes a
50-44 win over Lehman (N.Y.)
College last Friday night in the
opening round of the W&L Tip-
Off Tournament and a 77-72
overtime loss to Greensboro
(N.C.) College in the Tip-Off’s
title match Saturday evening.

“We certainly didn’t invite
any patsies to our event,” com-
ments Canfield on the tourna-
ment which also featured Ra-
mapo (N.J.) College. ““We were
beat by a good team which
played its style of ball on both

ends of the court. But we con-
tributed to Greensboro’s suc-
cess by committing untimely
defensive mistakes, like giving
up baseline drives and offensive
turnovers by inexperienced
players. Fortunately these are
repairable mistakes for us.
We'll be patient and concen-
trate on eliminating them.”’

Bright spots in the W&L play
included good shot selection,
good free throw percentage
(85.7 percent on 36 hits in 42 at-
tempts), and an effective come-
back against Greensboro.

Down 62-52 with 5:30 left to
play, the Generals rallied to
knot the game at 64-64 on two
free throws by junior forward
John Lee Graves with 18 sec-
onds left. Greensboro added a
basket two seconds later; W&L
countered with a score from
senior center Frank Eppes with
three seconds remaining to
force the overtime period.

Graves finished the night with
18 points, Eppes 15, senior for-
ward Brian Hanson 17, and
junior guard Bill Yates 12.
Graves, who scored 23 against
Lehman, including eight in a
row early in the second half to
put W&L on top for good, earned
a spot on the five-man All-
Tournament team. Other All-
Tournament selections were
Greensboro guard Haywood
Evans and forward Jeff King,
Lehman forward Steve Sim-
mons, and Ramapo forward An-
drew Allen.
