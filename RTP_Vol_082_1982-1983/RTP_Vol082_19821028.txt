Phony bomb

threat

empties Graham-Lees

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Graham-Lees Freshman Dormitory was
evacuated by Lexington police early
Wednesday morning in response to a
telephoned bomb threat. Emergency of-
ficials conducted a room-by-room search
of the building, but no explosive device
was found.

Police ordered the building cleared
about 2:20a.m. In light of recent fraternity
activities, many students responded with
disbelief to the order to assemble in the
quad. Nevertheless, the dormitory was
emptied in about ten minutes. Students
were allowed to return to their rooms when
the search was completed at 3:10 a.m.

As he watched the students rushing back
into the dormitory, police Lieutenant
Wayne Straub, the commanding officer on
the scene, said, ‘‘Ninety-nine percent of
the time you can figure it’s a hoax, but
because there’s that one percent chance,
you have to take the precautions we did.”’

Two police units, a life saving crew, a
hook and ladder unit, and two pumper
units responded to the call and surrounded
the building. A physical search of each
room in Graham-Lees was then carried
out.

‘We got the fire department out to give
us the manpower to do this,” field com-
mander Straub said. ‘‘We’ve looked in all
the obvious places—trash cans, storage
closets, and all the rooms.”

Acting Police Chief Bruce M. Beard said
that if explosives had been found, a state
police bomb squad would have been called
from Salem or Augusta County. Canine
units are also available from those
sources. ‘‘Thank God it turned out to be a
false alarm,” he said.

Beard said the police are extremely
cautious about ruling that a threat was a
hoax. ‘‘We just about turn the building up-
side down before we call off the search. We
make ourselves confident there’s no bomb

there.”’

Freshman Townes Pressler answered
the phone call in which the threat was
made. The call was placed at about 1:10
a.m. to one of the hall phones on the second
floor of Graham-Lees.

Pressler quoted the adult male caller as
having said, ‘‘Listen! There’s a bomb on
the second floor of Graham-Lees. A
bomb.” The caller then hung up.

‘‘He didn’t sound drunk,”’ Pressler said.
“He sounded perfectly straight — there
wasn’t even any music in_ the
background.”

Pressler, a pre-med major who was
elected freshman class president last
week, went back to his room to think for a
for a few minutes.

“I knew what would happen if I called
the police — they’d get everybody out of
the building, and I didn’t want that.”
However, he said, “I thought I’d feel
mighty guilty if everyone in here got blown
up.”’

“IT went down the hall to see if they’d
called on the other phone, but the line was
tied up,”’ he said. He then went to his dorm
counselor, Frank Eppes, who in turn con-
tacted Assistant Head Dormitory Coun-
selor Newton Kendrick. The heating plant
was called, and the night watchman came
and inspected the floor. When he found
nothing, he reached Asssistant Proctor
Burr Datz at home, who ordered that the
police be called.

Police records show that the call came in
at 2:13, and units were on the scene six
minutes later.

During the search, students assembled
in the Davis Dormitory quad and near the
bookstore. Others escaped the frigid
weather by congregating in the Commerce
School and the library.

Robert Huntley, Dean of Freshmen, said
approximately 235 students and sixteen
dorm counselors are housed in Graham-
Lees.

Faculty moves toward major curriculum change

Faculty members have been
debating, sometimes with great
passion, over a proposal to in-
crease the number of _ the
distribution credits a student
must earn to graduate from 36
to up to 53.

It comes to a vote at Mon-
day’s monthly faculty meeting.

Sources say the proposed plan
‘will probably be approved, with
minor alterations, at the
meeting.

The plan will allow students
less of a chance to determine
their schedule. According to the

plan, a student would have to

reach the second level of
foreign language study before
graduation. He would also have
to have six credits in English
literature and four credits in a
laboratory science, among
other requirements.

The plan was drawn up by a
faculty committee under the
chairmanship of English pro-
fessor Sidney Coulling. The
Committee on General Educa-
tion, as it was called, was an
outgrowth of a faculty/student
committee set up in 1980 to
study a perceived lack of direc-
tion in the  university’s
academic life.

This committee issued a
report last spring in which it
outlined its curriculum pro-
posals. The report, some of
which is reproduced here, pro-
posed to revamp the idea of
general education in the face of
increasing amounts of students
who come to college looking for
courses which will assist them
get into graduate school.

Reproduced here is part of
the Committee on General

Education’s report, which will
be voted on this Monday.

The Committee unanimously
makes the following recommen-
dations to the faculty:

I. In the areas of the human-
tities we support an increase in
the minimum requirements
from 12 to 18 credits for the best
prepared student and 33 credits
for those least proficient in
languages.

A. Requiring the student to
learn and practice effective
composition is, and should re-
main, the responsibility of the
entire W&L faculty. Never-
theless, we are sensitive to the
challenge from parents and
alumni who incredulously ask
us, “Can a student graduate
from Washington and Lee
without ever completing an

English course?’ Moreover, we
recognize that a formal, stated
requirement will help to im-
press the student with the im-
portance we place on writing
ability. We recommend that the
English department continue to
assess the proficiency of enter-
ing students and that the faculty
require the least proficient to
complete English 101, and the
moderately proficient to com-
plete English 111, or 113, 115.
The most proficient would be
exempt from a composition re-
quirement.

B. In 1981, over one-third of
our degree applicants offered
no foreign language for degree
credit. The Committee believes
that one of the most liberating
studies which the liberal arts
curriculum offers is acquain-
tance with a culture other than

the student’s own and that the
study of a foreign language is
the best way to gain such ac-
quaintance. The breadth of our
current language offerings
leads us to the conclusion that
the time has come to re-
emphasize to the student the
value of foreign languages as a
tool for gaining access to other
cultures. Since all agree that a
single year of foreign language
provides the student with little
benefit in itself, we recommend
that the faculty require comple-
tion of the intermediate or se-
cond year. Such a requirement
would assure that a student has
a real option of studying
another culture through
reading its literature in the
original language or _par-

* THIS, HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT, IN ANY

Elections: It’s still a dead heat

By MIKE ALLEN

As area voters go to the polls
on Election Day next Tuesday,
they will be helping to deter-
mine the outcome of two sharp-
ly contested, closely-watched
political campaigns. In both the
Senatorial and the Congres-
sional race, the two candidates
are running in a virtual dead
heat.

In addition, Rockbridge Coun-
ty voters will elect a represen-
tative to the State House of
Delegates, and Virginians will
give their opinion of three pro-
posed amendments to the state
Constitution.

Political Primer

Virginia tends to vote
Republican in national elec-
tions, while Democrats are
firmly in control at the state
level.

The Democrats have carried
the state in a Presidential elec-
tion only once since 1952, and
nine of the state’s ten Congres-
sional seats are Republican.
Congressional Quarterly says
that it expects at least seven of
these GOP seats will be retain-
ed, and in two races — sixth
district, including Lexington,
and the eighth district, compos-
ed of Washington, D.C. suburbs
— there is “‘no clear favoite.”’

The Democrats haven't
elected a Senator since 1966.
One of the state’s seats in the
Senate is held by Republican
John W. Warner, who was
elected in 1978 and faces the
voters again in 1984.

The other seat — the one
that’s up for election next week
— has been held by the Harry F.
Byrds, junior and senior, for fif-
ty years. In 1970, Harry Byrd
Jr., abandoned the Democratic
party because of his opposition
to its loyalty oath and became
the Senate’s only Independent.
Although he remains a member
of the Senate Democratic Cau-
cus for organizational matters,
he generally votes conser-
vatively and with the Republi-
cans.

The 67-year-old Senator

et Bap eee

 

shocked the state by announc-
ing last November 30 that he
wouldn’t seek re-election this
year. ‘‘Eighteen years is long
enough,”’ he said at the time.

Last November, Charles S.
Robb, son-in-law of former
President Lyndon B. Johnson,
was elected the state’s first
Democratic governor since
1969. His success in that contest
has raised speculation about a
possible role for him in national
Democratic affairs, including
talk that he is potential Vice-
Presidential choice in 1984.
Robb has called such conjec-
ture premature.

In the State Senate, Demo-
crats have a 31-9 advantage,
and in the State House of
Delegates, Republicans are out-
numbered 74-25, and there is
one Independent.

The Old Dominion is con-
sidered by many to be political-
ly conservative, although that
assumption was disputed by a
poll last month by the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch. That
state-wide survey showed the
majority of respondents to be in
favor of Federal legislation re-
quiring that owners of hand-
guns be licensed, for a new
Equal Rights Amendment, and
in favor of a freeze on deploy-
ment of additional nuclear
arms by the United States and
the Soviet Union.

Respondents opposed a con-
stitutional amendment to
outlaw abortions except when
the mother’s life is endangered
by pregnancy, and were against
tax credits for tuition payments
to private elementary and high
schools. However, the survey
showed that those polled were
in favor of at least two items on
the conservative agenda — the
death penalty and voluntary
prayer in public schools.

Senatorial Scramble

The Virginia Senate cam-
paign, one of thirty-three in the
nation this fall, has been called
by The New York Times ‘“‘what
may be the closest Senate race
in the country.”

WAY, BE CONSTRUED AS A CHANGE OF 200 POLICY,

Republican Paul S. Trible,
first district U. S. Con-
gressman, is facing Democrat
Richard J. Davis, the state’s
Lieutenant Governor, in a
vicious battle which has been
fought largely in the media. The
$5 million campaign has been
characterized by backbiting
and accusations by both can-
didates.

The most recent verbal joust
was initiated by Davis last
Thursday in Portsmouth when
he said that Trible would be
“the senator who represents
Jerry Falwell,’ the television
evangelist and founder of Moral
Majority. Davis charged that
his opponent would be a ‘“‘sur-
rogate” for Falwell, who, he
continued, would not allow a
“democracy which permits all
people to have their own beliefs
without being told what to do,
when to do it, and where to do
it.” Davis added that his
backers should be prepared
“for a last-minute media blitz”’
by Falwell, who is ‘mobilizing
his flock and his substantial
financial resources to elect can-
didates backed by the Moral
Majority.”’

The statement prompted a
counterattack by Trible, who
said in Lynchburg the next day,
“This is a prime example of the
desperate tactics of my oppo-
nent.-Rev. Falwell and I have
not talked about the cam-
paign.’’ Falwell said Davis was
“attempting to create a straw
man to get the people’s minds
off the real issues.’’ Ronald
Godwin, executive vice presi-
dent of Moral Majority, said
that if Davis were saying the
political organization was pre-
paring a media blitz for Trible,
“He’s flatly lying.”’

Other issues, or pseudo-
issues, in the campaign have
been: Trible’s attendance
record in Congress, which
Davis charges has been poor
and has resulted in missed
votes on Pentagon appropria-

The rules of life

By ALLEN ROBERTS
Special to The Phi

“An event has happened, upon which it is difficult to speak, and im-
possible to be silent.”

Edmund Burke, 1788

The arrest of six students for violation of Alcoholic Beverage
Control codes was closely followed by a directive from the Com-
monwealth’s attorney for local police to start arresting anyone
seen drinking in public. This action was described as ‘‘a surprise
attack’’ in last week’s Phi editorial, and as the first blow in a
“‘grudge-match” between students and local officials.

Most students cannot consider themselves members of both the
W&L community and the local citizenry. Dave Stevens, who is one
exception to this rule, wrote a letter that appeared in The Phi last
Thursday. Stevens concluded that ‘‘Arrest or death can change
one’s life, but action by the ABC officials may have prevented
recurrences that are unnecessary.”

If you are concerned enough to read this column, you must have
heard about the recent deaths of two University of Virginia
students in the U-Haul truck wreck and three VMI cadets and a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College student on Route 11. You may
not be concerned enough, however, to recognize that neither of
these wrecks was an accident.

Webster defines an accident as “‘an event which proceeds from
an unknown cause, or is an unusual effect of a known cause.” Both
fatal wrecks were caused by a known problem — many students do
not understand how powerful and unpredictable the force is on the
other end of a steering wheel.

Most of us who do understand often forget in the haze of drunken-
ness. We can identify the cause, but the untimely deaths of students
like you and me is not an unusual consequence of that cause.

I have gotten wasted on Saturday nights and forgotten the
dangers, taking my short life into my driving hands. On Sunday
morning I have quaked with the fear that I will do it again.

It’s not as if I have not seen the hazards first-hand. In high school,
the four people closest to me narrowly escaped death in a car
wreck. Two of them were athletes who will never compete again.
But they are alive, and may yet live to know a parent’s anxiety.

Margaret N. Abbitt, Danny Lawless, Jim Bogosian, Stan Ross,
Christopher Meigs and Brian McKittrick were not so fortunate.
They will not swim at Goshen this spring or see next fall’s foliage on
the Blue Ridge Parkway. Their parents must bear the ultimate
loss, their friends the pain of a missing laugh. These are the wounds
of the survivors, the wounds that will never heal.

Enforcement of ABC regulations helps to prevent these deaths.
We are sorely deceived if we think local police get a thrill breaking
up parties and arresting incalcitrant students for drinking in
public. Nevertheless, they would rather perform these unpopular
duties than be the first to arrive at the scene of a fatal crash.

Though the law is not the only point of conflict between students
and the Lexington community, it is the one we should first address.
For ourselves and the people who care for us, we must accept
responsibility for our drinking habits. We must stifle our drunken
vanity and surrender the car keys to a sober friend. We must ease
up on the ‘“‘Kamikazes,’’ lest we inherit their history on the drive
home.

Phi Editor-in-Chief Todd Smith wrote last week that “‘we must
regulate ourselves and defend the privilege to do so.” This is a
privilege that I fear we must earn anew, for our record is weak and
our resolve unproven.

A century has passed since John Ruskin made this crucial obser-
vation:

“Government and cooperation are in all things the

laws of life; anarchy and competition the laws of

death.”

In 1982, let’s party . . .under the rules of life.

W&L hosts food services

A lot of students will be eating
high on the hog next week when
W&L hosts a three-day regional
conference of the National
Association of College and
University Food Services.

Jerry Darrell, food services
director, is coordinating the
event, which will be held Nov. 2
through Nov. 4.

Instead of simply feasting the
food service directors who will

attend, Darrell said he will use
his NACUFS budget and the
donations from local food
sellers to feed the students who
eat in the dining hall.

That means a “special event
dinner,’ and Tuesday the
theme will be “Election ’82,”
since statewide elections are
held that day.

IFC hits SAE

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council met Tues-
day evening with cadet leaders
from Virginia Military Institute
to discuss the rules surrounding
cadet attendance at W&L fra-
ternity parties.

Pat Mooney, secretary to the
IFC, called the talks ‘‘mean-
ingful”’ and said the cadets had
promised to remind the corps of
the VMI rule that no cadet may
enter a fraternity without ver-
bal or written permission from
a fraternity member.

The IFC judicial board also
punished Sigma Alpha Epsilon
with two weeks of social proba-

tion for receiving a police noise
violation.

Representatives of SAE have
said that the noise violation
came after several brothers in-
formally gathered and acciden-
tally played the stereo too loud.
Since there was no party, SAE
claimed that two weeks was too
much.

Mooney said SAE has appeal-
ed the decision to the Student
Affairs Committee on the
grounds that the IFC should be
able to sentence offenders with
less than two weeks, which is
now the SAC-mandated mini-
mum.

EC opposes
faculty plan

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

At its weekly Monday night
meeting, the Executive Com-
mittee spent nearly an hour and
a half discussing something
over which it has little if any
control. The subject was the
faculty’s proposed curriculum
requirements.

Basically, the changes in-
volve more specific distribution
requirements. As it stands, a
student must take 36 credits of
distribution work. The proposal
from the Faculty Executive
Committee would raise that
number to 53 for certain
students. Most of these students
would be those concentrating on
business, which prompted EC
President Bennett Ross to say
“I think this is a vendetta
against business majors.”’

After various discussions on
whether a foreign language is
necessary for a liberal arts
education and how much math
and science should be required,
Morgan Griffith suggested that
the EC ‘‘vote on the theory of
the proposal and not wallow in
the credits.”

The committee voted to urge
the faculty to maintain the cur-
rent distribution philosophy.

Senior Rep. John Vlahoplus
suggested that splitting English
and foreign languages into two
divisions might solve the pro-

ship in extracurricular ac-
tivities, and potential for the
future.

Outstanding students have
been honored in the annual
“‘Who’s Who’’ directory since it
was first published in 1934.

The Washington and Lee
seniors elected this year are
James Averett, James Bald-
win, Peter Baumgaertner, Scott
Bond, DeWitt Caruthers, Steven
Corbeille, Michael Drinkwater,
Mason Ellerbe, Frank Eppes,

blem of students not having ex-
posure to foreign languages
without “‘legislating’’ them into
specific courses.

Griffith, vice-president of the
EC, stated that the EC should
“leave the educating to the
educators.’’ The EC will discuss
specific recommendations to
the faculty at a meeting tonight
at 6:30. The faculty as a whole
will vote on these requirements
Monday.

Many undergraduate mem-
bers of the EC were upset be-
cause they were not invited to
hear Supreme Court Justice
Lewis Powell speak at the law
school last Monday. Conse-
quently, the committee voted to
send letters to President
Huntley and Law School Dean
Steinheimer.

“We need to register our
displeasure that Justice
Powell’s appearance was not
publicized on the undergrad-
uate campus,” Vlahoplus said.
The motion passed unanimous-
ly.

Pete Baumgaertner also re-
ported that the equipment in the
weight room had been repaired
and that the purchase of new
equipment was being con-
sidered.

“Coach Miller said that there
were ‘budgetary restrictions’ so
I’m not sure if they will get
more equipment,” Baumgaert-
ner commented.

tions bills, important to the
defense establishments of
Virginia to whom these are
economically vital; the unem-
ployment situation in Ports-
mouth when Davis was mayor
there, which Trible says
worsened considerably; and a
memo Trible circulated charg-
ing Davis representatives with
soliciting funds and showing TV
spots at a New York meeting of
labor’s Committee on Political
Education which Davis con-
tends was a ‘malicious
falsehood.”’

The substantive part of the
campaign has regarded the
economy, taxes, employment
and Social Security, with the
candidates hewing to the party
line fairly consistently.

Polls show the candidates
running virtually even, and
many analysts believe it is the
‘“‘undecided” voters who will
determine the election’s out-
come.

Congressional Clash

Republican Kevin Miller and
Democrat James Olin have con-
ducted an issues-oriented cam-
paign for the sixth Congres-
sional district, which includes
Rockbridge County. Until
recently, the race appeared to
be a toss-up, but some of
Miller’s support has eroded in
the last few days of the cam-
paign according to one poll.

The two are battling for the
seat of Republican M. Caldwell
Butler, who is retiring after
having served in the House for a
decade. Miller has served in the
Virginia House of Delegates for
two terms, and Olin is a retired
General Electric Company ex-
ecutive.

Last week, the marketing
research firm of Martin
Research Associates last week
released a poll of the Roanoke
Valley which showed Olin with
44 percent of the vote compared
to Miller’s 32 percent. Twenty-
four percent was undecided,
and the poll had a margin of er-
ror of plus or minus five per-
cent. Martin Research said it
conducted the poll as a public
service and that it wasn’t com-
missioned by any political
group.

Steve Yeaker, Miller’s cam-
paign manager admits the
results “roughly resemble
ours.’”’ He said, ‘‘Our polls show
(Miller) trailing a bit in the
Roanoke Area.’’ He added that

he is confident Miller will win
because undecided voters ‘‘are
heading our way.” In an inter-
view with The Associated
Press, he concluded, ‘‘We look
forward to the end of the cam-
paign being a rather exciting
period.”

Skip Holcombe, Olin’s cam-
paign manager, told AP, “I
think we can win....I think the
‘stay the course’ theme has just
about worn extremely thin.”
Republicans have dominated
the sixth district for thirty
years.

The candidates have been
reflecting the views of their
respective parties in campaign
appearances, with Social
Security being one of the big-
gest issues.

Olin has had campaign help
from both Governor Robb and’
Lieutenant Governor Davis.
Miller has been seeking to iden-
tify himself closely with the
President, and Vice President
George Bush was expected to
make a campaign appearance
for him this week in Roanoke.
Incumbent Representative
Butler has also thown his full
support behind Miller.

Delegate Duel

Republican Vance Wilkins,
Jr., and Democrat Nanalou
Sauder are campaigning for the
24th District seat in the House of
Delegates. Because of.
redistricting, the term will be
an interim one of only one year.

Wilkins’ a businessman who
was elected to the House of
Delegates before, has been en-
dorsed by the Rockbridge Re-
publican Committee. Sauder, a
member of the Rockbridge

County. Board of Supervisors, is
a teacher in the Lexington
public schools.

The two met recently at the
Rockbridge County Courthouse
in an exchange sponsored by
the League of Women Voters.
At that meeting, Wilkins said

Constitutional Questions

On November 2, Virginia
voters will decide whether or
not three amendments will be
added to the state Constitution.
The ballot questions are:

1) Shall the Constitution of
Virginia be amended to change
the information required to
register to vote by deleting
marital status and occupation
and by including any prior legal
name? ;

2) Shall Section 1 of Article II
of the Constitution of Virginia
be amended to authorize restor-
ation of civil rights to felons as
may be provided by general
law? ;

3) Shall the Constitution of
Virginia be amended to author-
ize the General Assembly to
limit the introduction of legisla-
tion in the odd-year short ses-
sion?

The first two appear likely to
be ratified while ratification of
the third by voters remains in
doubt. The complete text of
each of the amendments will be
at the polling places, and is
posted at the Courthouse at the

corner of Washington and Main

streets in Lexington.

Should CONTACT
and FOCUS team up?

By BETTY MUNGER

I feel as if Iam being recycled.

When CONTACT was launched some fifteen years ago, it concen-
trated on one important theme for each year. Once it was political
power. Another time the focus was on energy. The speakers ap-
peared in quick succession over a period of two or three weeks.
There was a fine air of excitement in the middle of each winter and
we packed Lee Chapel for the variety of lively talks and discus-
sions. Only a real blizzard could keep us or the speaker away.

Then it began to change. The change in the calendar reduced
winter term to twelve weeks. Students found the compressed CON-
TACT weeks ate up too much study time. So CONTACT was thinned
out over the whole year. Too, speakers began to be available only
through agencies, at higher and higher prices with speeches that
were seldom keyed to any chosen theme.

. Result: CONTACT is now a famous-name series with no specific
purpose.

Now a new group has been formed, FOCUS, which proposes to
concentrate on a particular crucial issue. This is where I came in
fifteen years ago and it has set me to wondering! Wondering,
“What if the two groups pooled their resources for a really big
famous-name symposium or debate on a critical issue?” It would
cost money, for sure, and it could not be done by just flipping
through speakers bureaus’ face books. It would take hard careful
planning., pulling out all the stops with publicity on an area-wide
basis. Possible subjects: nuclear waste; genetic engineering; the
growing gap between the haves and the have nots on this planet;
nuclear armament build-up. Over to you!

ticipating in our foreign study
programs. Entering students
who demonstrate, on the place-
ment tests administered by the
language departments, that
they are qualified to enter third-
year language courses would be
exempt from a_ foreign
languagerequirement.

D. Our present distribution
system places courses in
English alongside the foreign
languages and permits the stu-
dent to select more or less at
random. Such an arrangement
encourages him to believe that
elementary courses in a foreign
language are somehow inter-
changeable with courses in
literature. We believe it is im-
portant to make clear that
literature is a distinct field of
creative and critical endeavor,
that both language and litera-
ture are worthy of study in their
own right and not as substitutes
for each other. We recommend
that the faculty require two
courses (6 credits) in literature
from any of the following; Eng-
lish courses numbered 200 or
above, comparative literature,
and foreign literature at the
third-year level or above.

E. The fine arts are among
the most exalted products of
man’s creative impulse, history
remains one of the most fre-
quent ways in which Western
man explains himself; philoso-
phy is the oldest and, in a sense,
most central academic
discipline, and religion is the
expression of some of
mankind’s earliest and deepest
concerns. Although each of
these areas deserves equal pro-
minence with the other disci-
plines as worthy of the student’s
attention, some of the most em-
phatic calls for preserving the
broadest range of student
choice emanate from faculty

he se it sd

cordingly we recommend that
the faculty require 12 credits
chosen from at least two of the
following three areas: fine arts,
history, and philosophy and/or
religion.

II. In the sciences (natural
and social) and mathematics,

ithe Committee recommends an

increase in the minimum re-
quirements from 12 to 19
credits.

A. From the natural sciences
and mathematics we recom-
mend a total of 10 credits: one
course in a laboratory science
(4 credits), one course in

mathematics (3 credits), and ©

the other 3 credits in either
science or mathematics.

(1) In 1981, about one-third of
our degree applicants offered
no laboratory science for
degree credit. Since our last
curriculum revision, biology,
chemistry, and physics have
added introductory courses
designed for students not plan-
ning to continue in a scientific
field. Taking as a given the fun-
damental role of science in
modern culture, and believing
that even the student who does
not intend to pursue science can
nonetheless benefit from con-
ducting scientific experiments,
we recommend that the faculty
require at least one 4-credit
course in a laboratory science.

(2) In 1981, 23 percent of our
degree applicants offered no
mathematics for degree credit.
Yet many faculty stress the im-
portance of calculus as a major
achievement of the human in-
tellect and the gateway to ad-
vanced mathematical study,
and others hold that statistics
and computer science are
useful alternatives for many
students. In either case mathe-
matics is a unique disci-
pline worthy of study for its
own sake as well as for the
powerful descriptive and

OS is is fi ff fh ee a

  

understanding the modern
world. We recommend that, of
the 10 required credits in
science and mathematics, a
minimum of 3 credits be in
mathematics provided that the
mathematics department of-
fers, at the entry level, alter-
natives to calculus.

B. Amidst the swirl of public
debate, the social sciences play
a key role in defining policy
issues as well as in suggesting
solutions to problems. We
recommend a requirement in
the social sciences of 9 credits
from at least two of the follow-

ing: economics, politics,
psychology, and sociology/an-
thropology.

III. We recommend retention
of the 1-credit requirement in
physical education.

IV. Since our proposals would
assure breadth in the student’s
general education, we recom-
mend that courses in his major
be counted as fulfilling part of
his general education re-
quirements. Thus, for example,
a physics major could count 4
credits in physics and 6 credits
in mathematics toward both his
major and his general educa-
tion requirements, and if he
were very well prepared in
English and foreign languages
he would have a total general
education requirement of only
28 credits (a maximum of 43 if
he were less well prepared). A
history major could count 9
credits in history for both his
major and his general educa-
tion requirement, and if he were
very well prepared in English
and foreign languages he would
have a total general education
requirement of only 29 credits
(a maximum of 44 if he were
less well prepared). A student
with two majors could count
courses in both his majors for
general education; thus a well-
prepared physics and history

education requirement of only
19 credits — 6 in literature; 3 in
fine arts, philosophy, or
religion; 9 in the social
sciences; and 1 in physical
education. Overall, these pro-
posals would permit the best
student more free electives
than he has under our present
system. Advanced placement
credit, of course, would fulfill
general education require-
ments just as it now meets
distribution requirements.

V. The Committee has also
heard suggestions from some
faculty that certain courses in
one department might be con-
sidered as falling in a general
education category different
from that under which the
department’s courses would
normally fall. For example,
there may be courses outside
the English department that so
heavily stress expository
writing as to meet the composi-
tion requirement. Therefore we
recommend the following pro-
cedure: Departments would
designate the general education
category, if any, under which
each of their courses belongs (a
department could declare, if it
wished, that none of its courses
belong under general educa-
tion); such designations would
be subject to approval of the
faculty upon recommendation
by the Committee on Courses
and Degrees.

VI. The report from the ‘‘Lilly
Group” of last summer was the
beginning point for much of the
Committee’s discussion.
Because we simply ran out of
time, we were unable to deal
with two of the Group’s most
important suggestions: the
creation of a general honors
program, and the institution of
interdisciplinary ‘‘capstone’’
courses. We strongly recom-
mend the appointment of
another committee to examine

the faculty by May, 1983.

In conclusion, the Committee
wishes to stress that our conver-
sations with the faculty over the
last few months have recon-
firmed our view that one of the
strengths of Washington and
Lee is the dedication of its facul-
ty to the task of educating the
young. When faculty most
strongly disagree with one
another it is most often over
how and what to teach, not
whether and why. The Commit-
tee recognizes that our conclu-
sions finally rest upon personal
judgment and that some faculty
members, for good reasons and
in good faith, will dissent from
them. We also recognize that
there may be ways to meet the
various interests of the faculty
other than those we have
recommended, and we invite
the faculty to suggest alter-
natives. We hope that our
recommendations will stimu-
late discussion among faculty
and students, for we believe
that such discussion is healthy
and constructive when con-
ducted in an atmosphere of
mutual respect for the right to
differ and of recognition that we
are all talking about different
means of achieving the same
end.

The Committee realizes that
no set of requirements can
assure that any student will
emerge as a_ well-educated
adult, but we do believe that re-
quirements can expand that
rare opportunity which a liberal
arts education affords, namely,
the opportunity, for a_ brief
time, to pursue knowledge pure-
ly for its own sake and to exer-
cise the intellect solely for the
pleasure of doing so. In the last
analysis, our various dis-
ciplines are different means to
that same end — an end which,
in unpredictable ways, benefits
the student throughout his life.

Water polo dominates play,
to host State Championships

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Sports Writer

The Washington and Lee
water polo team showed what it
was made of last weekend as
it continued its dominance over
the Southern League. The Gen-
erals tallied four more vic-
tories over the weekend,
stretching their unbeaten
league record to eight, and their
overall record to 19-6.

It was another weekend of
consistency, as the Generals
literally outclassed their com-
petition. In fact, the only sur-
prise to Coach Page Remillard
came when he looked up into the
gallery. ‘I was most ap-
preciative and pleased with the
overflowing crowds,’’ said
Remillard.

The crowds were treated to
wins over Virginia Common-
wealth (13-4), Hampden-Sydney
(17-6), . UNC-at-Wilmington
(14-6) and an 8-5 triumph over
league-rival Richmond. In the

Two overtime goals by Rad-
ford University downed Wash-
ington and Lee’s soccer team
Saturday morning on Wilson
Field by a score of 3-1.

The Generals’ one regulation
goal was scored by freshman
Keith Scott, who was named
player-of-the-game.

The loss dropped Washington
and Lee’s record to 5-3-2 and
knocked them out of the running
for a berth in the NCAA play-
offs, according to head coach
Rolf Piranian.

Piranian blamed the Gener-

fans was literally standing

trailed 2-1 at the half.

‘“‘We were tense and we tried
too hard in the first half,”’ noted
Remillard. This overintensity
resulted in some poor shot

selection and an inability to con-

waiting for the gears to mesh,”
asserted the Generals’ mentor,

Injuries hurt fall tennis

By DAVID STUART
Phi Staff Writer

It is more than a challenge to
beat a Division I team when the
Generals’ tennis squad is
healthy. When injuries and ill
fate befall half of the starting
six players, one can call it
doom.

So was the case Saturday, as
George Washington and Ohio
Universities beat W&L 9-0 and
7-2 respectively, in the fall
season finale.

Craig Cannon, No. 1, was
forced to retire because of

cramps in the second set of his
match against Ohio.

Charlie Kalocsay, No. 3 last
year, sprained his ankle over
the summer and could not play
during the fall season. Anthony
Frens, a bright freshman pro-
spect, pulled two back muscles
earlier this season, and saw no
action Saturday.

The fall tennis season is a
testing ground for the spring
season. In spite of Saturday’s
not unexpected double drubbing
and the troublesome injuries,
varsity tennis coach Gary
Franke is encouraged.

The “‘new kids (freshmen An-
thony Frens, Scott Adams, Jim
Culnane and first-year-playing
sophomore Chip Archer) are
making contributions,” says
Franke. As a result, Franke
believes: this year’s team is
“stronger,” and ‘thas more dep-
th’’ than last years’.

Presently, there are nine can-
didates jostling for eight posi-
tions on the spring roster. The
ladder is by’ no means fixed,
with Kolocsay and Frens in-
jured. But Saturday’s top seven
were: Cannon, Steve Denny,
Andy Haring, Jim Irwin, Ar-
cher, Adams and Culnane, in
that order.

W&L commits six turnovers

 

Sewanee comes from behind for 21-20 victory

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

The University of the South
put 14 fourth-quarter points on
the board to erase a 20-7
Washington and Lee halftime
lead, and beat the Generals
21-20 in a non-conference foot-
ball game at Wilson Field
Saturday.

The loss dropped W&L to 3-3
overall. The University of the
South, located in Sewanee,
Tenn., raised their mark to 5-2.

The first half was probably
the best half the team has
played this season. W&L coach
Gary Fallon stated, ‘‘point
wise,”’ it was their best offen-
sive performance for a half.

In the second half though, six
turnovers plagued the Gener-
als. Sewanee converted two of
the turnovers into touchdowns.

“Errors stand out more in
close games,” observed Fallon.
“I don’t want these guys to
think they personally lost the
game. We try to guard against
pointing fingers: We’ve got to
learn from what’s happened,”
he said.

W&L used a wide-open of-
fense the first time they touched
the ball to march quickly down
the field. Sophomore quarter-
back John Thompson com-
pleted six of seven passes dur-
ing the drive and senior Chris
Cavalline completed a 25-yard
halfback option pass to Jerry
Thompson. Sewanee’s defense
stiffened inside the 20, though,
and W&L had to settle for Bill
Devine’s 27-yard field goal at
9:31 of the first quarter.

“We tried to keep them off
balance. We’re not known for
our throwing. But we had some
success with it, so we kept on
throwing,” Fallon said.

Sewanee used their own im-
pressive passing attack to drive
to a first-down-and-goal situa-
tion on their first possession.
However, W&L’s’ defense
mounted a classic goal line
stand and kept Sewanee off the
scoreboard.

“{ think our defense is the
kind that once they get a little
success they get confident,”
commented Fallon on the first
of two superb goal line stands.
‘You can’t be afraid of
challenges. You’ve got to say I
hope they come at me,” Fallon
noted.

Sewanee did get on the
scoreboard late in the first
quarter. Tim Tenhet tossed a 7-
yard touchdown pass to David
Duke with 42 seconds left in the
quarter to give Sewanee a 7-3
lead.

W&L quickly regained the
lead thanks to some alert
special teams play. Sophomore
David Sizemore recovered a
fumbled punt for W&L at the
Sewanee 22 yard line. Three
plays later freshman fullback
Frank Surface rumbled 14
yards up the middle for a W&L
touchdown. The extra point was
blocked, but W&L still led 9-7,

W&L scored on their next
possession as well. Using a mix-
ture of passes and runs, the
Generals covered 70 yards with
Chris Cavalline finishing the
drive with a one-yard touch-
down drive at 1:39 in the second
quarter. John Thompson passed
to Jerry Thompson for a two
point conversion and a 17-7 lead.

Only 52 seconds later W&L
got the ball back when senior
defensive back Gene Fellin
recovered a fumble at the
Sewanee 28 yard line. A 17-yard
pass from Thompson to senior
Phil Hrabar got the Generals in-
to field-goal range, and Devine
nailed a 22-yarder as time ex-
pired.

After a _ scoreless third
quarter, Sewanee began its
comeback. The Tigers in-
tercepted a pass at the W&L 34
and scored a few plays later on
a 6-yard lob to David Duke with
10:25 left in the game. The extra

point put Sewanee within six
points of W&L at 20-14.

A few minutes later Sewanee
had driven inside the W&L 10-
yard line again. Once more the
W&L defense came through
with a goal line stand to
preserve the lead temporarily.

Moments later Sewanee in-
tercepted a W&L pass at the
Generals’ 23-yard line. This
time the defense could not hold,
and Bob Rodderberry scored on
a 9-yard sweep. Phil Campbell’s
extra point gave Sewanee its
21-20 margin of victory.

W&L had a couple of shots at
pulling it out, but time ran out
with the Generals in possession
at midfield. With less than a
minute to go, a long pass to
Chris Cavalline was broken up
at the last second by several
Sewanee defensive backs.

Next week the Generals finish
their Old Dominion Athletic
Conference season at Bridge-

Paced by McBryde,

W&L improves to 8-1

Junior Angus McBryde ran
Washington and Lee’s 8000-
meter course in a time of 27:19
to pace the Generals’ cross-
country team to victories over
Old Dominion Conference foe
Bridgewater and also West
Virginia Tech.

McBryde’s time was 11
seconds better than that of the
second place finisher, and
sophomore Frank Pittman
placed third for the Generals in
a clocking of 27:31.

Senior John Kelafant finished
sixth, junior Paul Chapman
seventh, and freshman Bob
Glenn ninth to round out the
Generals’ top five.

Washington and Lee ac-
cumulated 26 points to Bridge-

water’s 39 and West Virginia
Tech’s 67. The Generals overall
dual meet record is now 8-1.

The win by McBryde marked
the fourth time in five races this
season that the junior has led
the team.

On Saturday, the Generals
will travel to Lynchburg to face
Eastern Mennonite College,
Hampden-Sydney College and
Lynchburg. Washington and
Lee finished four points behind
Lynchburg at the Virginia State
Division II and III Champion-
ships two weeks ago. ’ |

Next weekend, the Generals |
will host seven teams in the |
ODAC Championships over |
W&L’s course.

Bridgewater stands 1-5
overall and 1-2 in the league go-
ing into the contest. Last year
W&L beat the Eagles 30-0 in
Lexington.

Despite Bridgewater’s
record, Coach Fallon thinks it is

a dangerous team. “They’re a
much better football team they
were last year. They’re a
better defensive team,” he
stated.

Fallon pointed out that
Bridgewater is dangerous of-
fensively also. They scored 21

they also have a fine freshman
quarterback.
