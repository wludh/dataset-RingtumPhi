EC: Who suffers

by FD change?

by Rick Swagler

In its second meeting of the
school year, the W&L Executive
Committee discussed a pro-
posal to move Fancy Dress
Weekend from the current date
of March 4-5 to the weekend of
March 18-19.

The move was proposed by
Law School representative Ken
Terwilleger, after having dis-
cussed the matter with other
law students. According to Ter-
willeger, the problem with the
current date is that it coincides
with the beginning of the law
school’s spring holiday.

Terwilleger argued that in
order for law students to attend
this event, they must sacrifice
the first weekend of their break.
“It’s not fair to ask them to
stick around for something
their funds have paid for,”’ Ter-
willeger said.

Townsend Oast of the Student
Activities Board was present at
the meeting to answer questions
and defend the current date.
Oast made four points:

vSome fraternities have
already booked bands and
many groups from out-of-state
plan their tours around Fancy
Dress,

~The March 18 date may pre-
sent a difficult work load
because of the close proximity
to exams (two weeks) and the

number of papers usually due at
that particular time,

vFancy Dress has _tradi-
tionally been a winter event us-
ed to break up the time between
Washington Break and Spring
Term. Holding the event that
late in March would make it
more of a spring event, and

vy Law students usually have
classes on the Friday before
their spring break, and they
could leave on Saturday.

Terwilleger ended by saying
that the plans for Fancy Dress
should not be made around the
fraternities because ‘“‘though
they are an important part of
the University community, they
aren’t part of the school.” Ter-
willeger also said that he didn’t
think the winter tradition was
‘‘all that hard-core.”’

Junior representative Scott
Mason asked that the SAB find
out whether the girls’ schools
would be in session, and Presi-
dent Bennett Ross suggested
that the motion to vote be tabled
until further information was
brought before the Committee
by interested students.

“The ramifications will be ex-
treme and I don’t want us to
make this decision tonight,’
Ross said.

Vice President Morgan Grif-
fith argued that by tabling the

Bridgewater Student
-Young man challenges the U.S. draft

by B. Scott Tilley

BRIDGEWATER — This
sleepy little town, home of
Virginia’s first coeducation col-
lege, is about to be cast into na-
tional attention. On November
15, the first day of final exams
at Bridgewater College, senior
Enten Eller may begin a sen-
tence of up to six years in prison
for violation of the Selective
Service Act.

Federal District Judge James
Turk, at the end of Eller’s
August trial in Roanoke, asked
the 20-year-old if he had any
comments. “I told him that I
could not, in good conscience,
register,”’ said Eller in a recent
interview on the Bridgewater
campus. ‘“Ten seconds later, he
told me I had 90 days to
register.’’

As the end of the 90-day

period approaches, Enten is

standing firm. On the morning
of November 15, his probation
officer will report that there has
been a violation of probation.
The resulting hearing could pro-
duce a jail sentence of up to 6
years under the Youth Correc-
tions Act.

A six-footer with black hair
and glasses who likes to play
Star Trek on the college com-
puter, Eller said the final deci-
sion to be a non-registrant took
place the night he heard Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter make the
announcement to reinstate reg-
istration. ‘That night I took
some time and dealt with the
issue. At that point I felt I was
being led to not register, so I
didn’t,” he said.

“I anticipate not registering,
which should be a surprise to no
one, When I took the position in

the first place, I took it knowing
I could go to prison. Simply

because I’ve been given another
90 days to think about it doesn’t
change where I’m at — doesn’t
mean I’m running scared.

‘Now, there’s tension there,
It’s like someone dropped a
sword and it missed you so they
raised it back up and put it
above your head for a second
shot. It’s back to where I was in
the first place — back to square
one.”

A California native, Eller car-
ried a Bible with him during the
interview, and calls on religion
and God as the foundation of his
position, as well as his support
throughout. His father, Ver-
nard, is a minister in the
Church of the Brethren,
historically associated with the
Quakers and Mennonites for its
extreme pacifism. Eller said
that he believed that all war 1s
“sin,” but that is not the reason
for his non-registration.

“The basic belief in my posi-

before anyone else. Obedience
to God is first. It doesn’t matter
if I’m opposed to war...I don’t
make those kind of statements
with the position because that’s
not where I’m coming from,”
said the math-physics double
major.

“I’m not using the position as
a soapbox to address militar-
ism, or nuclear war, or
anything. This is what I have to
do for me to obey God, at least
as I understand Him and as I
see Him.

could be mistaken, because I

Eller has been active in other
types of ‘peace movements.’’
He is involved with the Ground
Zero anti-nuclear weapons
group, the Virginia State Peace-
making Committee, the Peace
Awareness Group on Campus,
and the Christians for Peace
group in Harrisonburg. The pro-
blem with most peace
movements though, Eller said,
is that they have forgotten the
true source of peace. And that is
God.

He also considers himself
patriotic. ‘‘Americans like to
think of themselves as very
patriotic, but you take the
American Revolution. That was
disobedience to the core, but yet
that was patriotic...If I’m point-
ing a better way or showing
God’s love, I don’t see how that
can be wrong for a nation,”’ he
said.

to allocate student money

by Todd Smith

Last year, two of the SAB’s
representatives were slightly
drunk when they made their
budget request to the EC.

The EC wasn’t in peak condi-
tion either: it was now 2 a.m.
Wednesday and they had been
sitting since 6:30 p.m. the day
before.

This is the EC budget hear-
ing, and it happens again Thurs-
day, Sept. 30. Last year’s ordeal
took eight hours. In that time
the Executive Committee
allocated over $92,000. As the
Phi noted last year, the question
isn’t why the EC wants to get it
over in one night. The question
is, How can they?

How can they evaluate Con-
tact, the Student Activities
Board, The Student Bar Asso-
ciation, the publications, the In-
tellectual Symposium, the
Political Review, the Outing
Club, the Computer Club, fenc-
ing and rugby all at once?

This year’s EC looks more
capable than ever before, and
certainly can be trusted to
allocate fairly. But you'll just
have to trust them because you
certainly won't understand
them.

As we noted in our Oct. 8,
1981, editorial, ‘‘The Criteria
excludes sleeping bags, picnics
and Infoton computer _ ter-
minals. The criteria includes
oranges, scrun sleds and porno
weekends.”’ You figure it out.

Last year’s presdient Eric
Myers said at the beginning of
his term, and his successor,
Bennett Ross, reaffirmed, that!
the biggest factor in the deci-
sion making process is the sub-
committee’s track record. If
they have used their money
frugally and efficiently, they
are rewarded.

Correction

In the Sept. 16 Interfraternity
Council story we misreported
when the Kappa Alpha social
probation would start. It will
start the Monday following
Homecoming. The Phi regrets
the error.

If that’s true then the SAB
will be getting nothing at all this
year. They even overspent what
the EC gave them for seconds to
bail them out for Fancy Dress.

The decision of how much to
allocate a sub-committee is
more complex. As John Vla-
hoplus, senior representative
has noted, the number of
students that benefit from the
service must also be counted in.

And then the EC must make
judgement calls between
oranges and parties and sleep-
ing bags. Last year’s judge-
ment not to finance the Inter-
varsity Christian Fellowship
produced a debate in which the
EC was asked, point blank,
“What exactly is your cri-
teria?’’ The answer was fuzzy.

There was no real answer.

And there are no real answers

to be had. But if the EC must re-
ly on judgement calls and intui-
tion to get out the budget, then
the students ought to be able to
watch their decision-making
process. And yet, what student
would want to sit in on an eight-
hour marathon?

It seems to me that only by
breaking up the hearing into

a]
aL

Letter:

two or three sessions can the
process become clear.

Of course, the general student
body is not going to get excited
about budgets and flock to
meetings spread over several
days. But as it is now, even club
members with a real interest
are discouraged from attend-
ing. As the evening wears on
and the schedule becomes a
joke, each group must wait for
its turn to come up at some
unknown time. Supporters of
various groups stick their heads
in, are told it will be another 30
minutes, and give up.

The only benefit that would
come from one eight hour ses-
sion is the time saved. Seniors
on the EC may be worried about
the Oct. 2 Law School Admis-
sions Test, and others may just
as soon get the budget over
with.

But aren’t the budgets the
most important thing the EC
handles, except for the honor
code?

The EC can best serve all our
interests by making the
budgeting process more ac-
cessible, and that probably
means getting rid of the budget
marathon.

Review needs you

Editor:

Last spring, an article in the
Ring-tum Phi likened the W&L
Political Review to The New
Republic. The author complain-
ed that such a conservative stu-
dent body should have a more
representative publication.
Because Review co-Editors C.
Jay Robbins and I are members
of Young Americans for Free-
dom, our delighted liberal col-
leagues subjected us to a great
deal of grief.

The Review is non-partisan
and will remain so; we welcome
all sides of the issues. No
“right-wing” articles will ap-
pear, however, if none is sub-

mitted. Since the Reaganites at
the law school could convene in
a phone booth, undergraduates
must help represent the Right
— and the Left and Middle, of
course. Faculty submissions
are welcome also.

If you are interested in
writing for the W&L Political
Review, please attend the in-
troductory meeting on Thurs-
day, September 23 at 7 p.m. in
Room 114 of the Student Center.
or contact co-Editor James
Falk at 463-9852.

THRUSH Oe steaks rts

 

Were our police
rotten to the top?

by John Cleghorn

When prosecuting attorney Beverly C. “John”
Read dropped the final cases in the Lexington police
trials three weeks ago, the Lexington-Rockbridge
community was allowed a deep breath of relief. Thir-
teen men who had been indicted came under in-
dividual scrutiny over the summer, seven of whom
were convicted. John Read’s reasoning for ending the
trials satisfied most people, as he appealed that the
community had experienced enough.

Read continued by saying that it remained for Chief
Kirby and the City of Lexington to initiate internal in-
vestigations to find whether or not the police force is
capable of recovering and beginning anew.

A week ago the Lexington City Council took the first
step in continuing the pursuit of the issue. Mayor
Charles Phillips asked Councilman T.C. Imeson to
read a resolution which announced that a special in-
vestigation would be executed by the city into the Of-
fice of the Chief of Police. This investigation attacks
the heart of the matter as it will focus on the leader-
ship, or the lack thereof, of a police force in which a
theft ring operated unnoticed for almost a decade.

The relationships within such an operation are in-
tricate and the questions concerning those relation-
ships are myriad. A valuable part of this investigation
would be an examination of the statments of each of
the officers who have been previously investigated. In
these statements, which are part of the public record,
there is evidence of a mutual understanding between
the officers concerning the common practice of steal-
ing from Lexington businesses such as Adair-Hutton,
Lexington Motors: and Spanky’s. It is up to the city
investigations to determine the depth of knowledge, if
any, that Chief Kirby had about these thefts and also
to discover why the theft ring, made up of law en-
forcement officers; was not terminated.

Also in the public record there are vague references
to impropriety on behalf of the leadership of the force.
With such questionable and suspicious allusions con-
cer ning the authority of the present police force left
unanswered, the issue remains open.

The Mayor, the City Council, and the Police Chief
himself must be satisfied with the leadership of the
Lexington Police Force. The investigations asked for
Thursday by the City Council should disclose the re-
maining questions of just how widespread the theft
‘ring was in its operation, and why it was able to
operate so smoothly for so long.

Lexington brightens with new bar and live music

by Bill Roberts

Live music and entertain-
ment will be the main attrac-
tions at the new bar on the cor-
ner of Nelson and Jefferson
streets with the video games in
front and the signs displaying
‘Palms Operahouse.”’

It is the latest business
endeavor by Doug Higgins and
Jay Korn, who are the co-
owners of the Campus Corner
record store and The Palms
restaraunt.

The Operahouse opened its
doors to the partying public last
Friday with an offering of live
music, beer and Mexican food:
a combination the entrepre-
neurs hope will bring in the
crowds.

“Friday, opening night, the
place was packed,” said Mack
Mason who is both a participant
in the venture with Higgins and
Korn and the group’s spokes-
man. Mason is also a part
owner of the Lexington Dry

A grease fire broke out in the
kitchen of the W&L Co-op
building at about 6:45 a.m.
Tuesday destroying a stove and
an adjacent wall, totalling ap-
proximately $2,500 in damages,
according to Food Services
Director Gerry Darrell.

house.

‘“‘Live music and entertain-
ment are the main thrust of the
place,’’ Mason said. The plan is
to bring in bands at least every
Wednesday, Friday and Satur-
day nights, if not more often.
That emphasis on performing
musicians is the rationale
behind the title “‘Operahouse,”’
which they prefixed with
“‘Palms’’ for name recognition
by the public, Mason said.

In keeping with the musical
theme, Mike Seeger, a folk
singer, will be playing Thurs-
day night and ‘‘108,’’ a middle-
of-the-road band from Char-

‘ lottesville, will be playing both

nights this weekend, Mason
said.

The building, which once
housed a Virginia Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board Store,
was renovated during the sum-
mer by Larry Dreshler, a Lex-

french fries and some other
foods will still be available,
Darrell said.

The Lexington Fire Depart-
ment arrived soon after the fire
became uncontrollable and ex-
tinguished the blaze before the
wall behind the stove collapsed,
Darrell said.

“Nobody with any sense
fights a grease fire,” said Co-op
cook Joan Mays. “‘We just got

ington builder. Mason said the
total cost of the renovation was
approximately $60,000.

An acoustically designed
band stand and a tile covered
beer bar are features of the in-
terior. A separate video-game
room is available for the
pleasure of Operahouse clien-
tele.

“These are the types of places
you see up and down the streets
of New York City, not in
southwest Virginia,’ Mason
said.

Higgins and Korn bought the
building June 25 for $102,500 ac-
cording to courthouse docu-
ments. To finance the project
they took a 15-year, variable
rate loan for $82,500 at a 17.5
percent interest rate from the
United Virginia Bank of Lex-
ington.

“We started talking, about a
year ago, about having a place
in Lexington that would be a cut
above everything else,’ Mason
said. ‘‘Now it is a reality.”

out and called the fire depart-
ment.”

“The Fire Department pre-
vented some real problems,”’
added Darrell, ‘‘They really
saved the building.’’

The wall behind the stove will
be rebuilt and the fire ex-
tinguishing system upgraded,
according to Darrell.

There were no injuries in the
mishap.

Review

Offenders: Good
but better when loud

by Edwin Bell

The Offenders (i.e. Bruce Olsen and the Offenders) have played
for W&L several times and seem to be a crowd favorite. The band is
composed of Bruce Olsen (guitar and vocals), Terry Garland
(guitar and vocals), Chris Link (drums), and Richard Cowles (bass
and vocals). Generic Records, a local label in Richmond, has just
released the Offenders’ debut album titled ‘“The Record.”

Although the album contains a generous amount of songs, 12,
most only range from 2 to 4 minutes in length. ‘“‘The Record” opens

with “Genuine Kamakaze Weekend”’ a song fairly reminiscent of |

the W&L phrase of work hard, party hard. It seems to be written
with W&L in mind with lines like ‘I Love the Girls’ Schools.’’ The
following song ‘‘Wait and See”’ contains a nice guitar solo but the
lyrics become redundant. In the third song ‘‘Hard On Baby”
Richard Cowles sings with a much more sharp and biting voice
than Olsen’s, which is like Jagger’s in that he makes the lyrics in-
distinguishable. While the next song, also by R. Cowles, tells the
story of a pessimistic future (‘‘no good times remain’), it contains
a pleasant catchy guitar riff. ‘‘(Immediate Relief” starts to reveal
what most of the Offenders’ songs are about — sex (‘‘temporary
love affairs’).

The last and longest cut on the first side called ‘Hearts Break
Down’”’ is probably the best. It has a nice Tom Petty sound and a
great guitar solo at the end. The second side of the album starts out
strong but then slowly falls apart. ‘“‘Just For Fun’’ is another sex
song (“‘I won’t use any whips and I broke all my chains’’) and ‘“‘Up-
town Boy” continues this theme while containing some nice-sax
work. The rest of the second side ‘‘Maximum Assumption,”’ ‘“Runn-
ing From A Life of Crime,” ‘‘Who’s Gonna Pay the Bill,” and
‘‘Money Machine’’ continue the theme of faulty lyrics.

The pluses of the album are Richard Cowles’ vocals on his three
songs and Chris Link’s rhythmic drive from the drums. The minus
is the songwriting on most of the cuts.

In closing, one hint should be revealed. As with the early Stones’
._Tecords, the album sounds much better when played at a high
volume. yet, overall, 1ur vneir first ettort the album remains a gooa

start.

Phi waxes poetical in new supplement

by Todd Smith

Poetry in the Phi?

This week we are kicking off the Phi Literary Supplement with
two artists’ insights into the man who set our school on the cur-
ricular and philosophical path we still follow today: Robert E. Lee.
"The Killer Angels,” reviewed by Steve Jones on the next page,
shows The Battle of Gettysburg through the eyes of its main par-
ticipants, including Lee.

The other glimpse into the personality of the emotional ‘‘marble
man’”’ comes from the poem ‘‘Lee in the Mountains,” written by
Donald Davidson.

Davidson was the most “unreconstructed” of the Southern
Agrarian writers when he wrote the poem in 1938. Agrarians believ-

ed, in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, that the farmer and the
planter were God’s chosen people. Davidson manned the bulwark
against the 20th century and its mechanized undoing of the
Southern way of life.

But Davidson passes up the opportunity to have Lee exort us to
“save our Confederate money.” In this poem, we see Lee playing
with the idea of carrying on the Civil War, now over, by taking it up
into the Blue Ridge mountains. The idea quickly passes, however,
as he remembers the ‘‘beardless boys (who) go up to death’’ and
“‘the weeping of young women.”’

We are left we the aging Lee, president of Washington College,
working on his father’s memoirs for publication and encouraging
his students to, as it were, lift up their eyes unto the hills.

“Lee in the Mountains,”’ by Donald Davidson

Waiking into the shadows, walking alone
Where the sun falls through the ruined boughs of locusts
Up to the president’s office....
Hearing the voices
Whisper, Hush, it is General Lee! And strangely
Hearing my own voice say, Good morning, boys.
(Don’t get up. You are early. It is long
Before the bell. You will have long to wait
On these cold steps...)

The young have time to wait.

But soldiers’ faces under their tossing flags
Lift no more by any road or field,
And I am spent with old wars and new sorrow.
Walking the rocky path, where steps decay
And the paint cracks and grass eats on the stone.
It is not General Lee, young men...
It is Robert Lee in a dark civilian suit who walks,
An outlaw fumbling for the latch, a voice
_ Jommanding ina dream where no flag flies.
My father’s house is taken and his hearth
. eft to the candle-drippings where the ashes
Vhirl at a chimney-breath on the cold stone.
can hardly remember my father’s look, I cannot
\nswer his voice as he calls farewell in the misty
“lounting where riders gather at gates.
ie was old then — I was a child — his hand
leld out for mine, some daybreak snatched away.
And he rode out, a broken man. Now let
His lone grave keep, surer than cypress roots,
The vow I made beside him. God too late
Unseals to certain eyes the drift
Of time and the hopes of men and a sacred cause.
The fortune of the Lees goes with the land
Whose sons will keep it still. My mother
Told me much. She sat among the candles,
Fingering the Memoirs, now so long unread.
And as my pen moves on across the page
Her voice comes back, a murmuring distillation
Of old Virginia times now faint and gone,
The hurt of all that was and cannot be.

Why did my father write? I know he saw

History clutched as a wraith out of blowing mist
Where tongues are loud, and a glut of little souls
Laps at the too much blood and the burning house.
He would have his say, but I shall not have mine.
What I do is only a son’s devoir

To a lost father. Let him only speak.

The rest must pass to men who never knew

(But on a written page) the strike of armies,

And never heard the long Confederate cry
Charges through the muzzling smoke or saw the bright
Eyes of the beardless boys go up to death.

It is Robert Lee who writes with his father’s hand —
The rest must go unsaid and the lips be locked.

If all were told, as it cannot be told —

If all the dread opinion of the heart

Now could speak, now in the shame and torment
Lashing the bound and trampled States —

If a word were said, as it cannot be said —

I see clear waters run in Virginia's Valley

And in the house the weeping of young women

Rises no more. The waves of grain begin.
The Shenandoah is golden with new grain.
The Blue Ridge, crowned with a haze of light,
Thunders no more. The horse is at plough. The rifle
Returns to the chimney crotch and the hunter’s hand.
And nothing else than this? Was it for this
That on an April day we stacked our arms
Obedient of a soldier’s trust? To lie
Ground by heels of little men,
Forever maimed, defeated, lost, impugned?
And was I then betrayed? Did I betray?
If it were said, as still it might be said —
If it were said, and a word should run like fire,
Like living fire into the roots of grass,
The sunken flag would kindle on wild hills,
The brooding hearts would waken, and the dream
itir like a crippled phantom under the pines,
\nd this torn earth would quicken into shouting
3eneath the feet of ragged bands — .
The pen
Turns to the waiting page, the sword
3ows to the rust that cankers and the silence.
Among these boys whose eyes lift up to mine
Within gray walls where droning wasps repeat
A hollow reveille, I still must face
Day after day, the courier with his summons
Once more to surrender, now to surrender all.
Without arms or men I stand, but with knowledge only
I face what long I saw, before others knew,
When Pickett’s men streamed back, and I heard the tangled
Cry of the Wilderness wounded, bloody with doom.
The mountains, once I said, in the little room
At Richmond, by the juddled fire, but still
The President shook his head. The mountains wait,
I said, in the long beat and rattle of siege
At cratered Petersburg. Too late
We sought the mountains and those people came.
And Lee is in the mountains now, beyond Appomatox,
Listening long for voices that never will speak
Again; hearing the hoofbeats come and go and fade
Without a stope, without a brown hand lifting
The tent-flap, or a bugle call at dawn,
Or ever on the long white road the flag
Of Jackson’s quick brigads. I am alone,
Trapped, consenting, taken at last in mountains.
It is not the bugle now, or the long roll beating.
The simple stroke of a chapel bell forbids
The hurtling dream, recalls the lonely mind.
Young men, the God of your fathers is a just
And merciful God Who in this blood once shed
On your green altars measures out all days,
And measures out the grace
Whereby alone we live;
And in His might He waits,
Brooding within the certitude of time,
To bring this lost forsaken valor
And the fierce faith undying
And the love quenchless
To flower among the hills to which we cleave,
To fruit upon the mountains whither we flee,
Never forsaking, never denying
His children and His children’s children forever
Unto all generations of the faithful heart.

Excerpt ;

(The following excerpt is from “The Killer Ange s,” copyright 1974
by Michael Shaara, and published by Random House Inc., New
York, N.Y. Here Robert E. Lee is seen on the night following the se-
cond day of the battle of Gettysburg. )

Lee moved off into the dark pasture. Now in motion he was aware
of stiffness, of weakness, of a suspended fear. He moved as if his
body was filled with cold cement that was slowly hardening, and
yet there was something inside bright and hot and fearful, as if
something somewhere could break at any moment, as \f a rock in
his chest was teetering and could come crashing down\ He found
the dark horse in the night and stood caressing the warm $ in, thick
bristly mane, feeding sugar, talking.

Two alternatives. We move away to better ground, as Longstreet
suggests. Or we stay. To the end.

cea Lee knelt and began to pray. His engineer’s mind went on
thinking while he prayed. He could find no flaw: we will go up the
center and split them in two, on the defense no longer, attacking at
last, Pickett and Hood and McLaws. By the end of the prayer he
was certain: he felt a releasing thrill. This was the way, as God
would have it. Face to face with the enemy, on grounds of his own
choosing. End with honor.

Freshmen muscle through orienting bustle

by Mike Allen

The class of ’86, the 360
newest members of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, has
gotten off to a strong, quick
start.

Their year began with a
rigorous orientation schedule
which included more than eight
hours of meetings in Lee
Chapel. The end of these seem-
ingly interminable proceedings
was celebrated Wednesday
night with a chip-in bash in the
Graham-Lees quad.

Dean of Freshmen Robert
Huntley said he was pleased
with how the first week went,
although it was somewhat dif-
ferent this time from previous
years. “It was a more ragged
orientation than in the past,’’ he
said recently ‘‘We compressed
five days of orientation into
three. Before, we had a more
leisurely pace, but this year, we
moved so quickly that once a
mistake was made, there was
no turning back. My nerves
were in a_ ragged state,”
Huntley said.

Still, he prefers the shorter
orientation period. ‘‘If I could
find a way to do it in one day, I’d
do it,’’ he said. The more com-
pact schedule was introduced
this year in order, says Dr.
Huntley, ‘‘to alleviate the
boredom I sometimes saw on
students’ faces.”’

Because the Graham-Lees
dormitory had just been reno-

vated, there were the usual in-
conveniences that go with open-
ing a new facility. Doors that
didn’t open, keys that didn’t
work, and furniture that was
stuck all came up, but Dean

the freshman class would tell
me what they found redundant,
unnecessary, and unhelpful,”
he said. Presumably, positive
remarks would be welcomed,
also.

 

“We compressed five days of
orientation into three.........my nerves

were in a ragged state.”

--Dean Huntley

Huntley says ‘‘we just hustled a
little harder and a little faster,
and we got it worked out.’’

Huntley, who is also director
of the Outing Club on campus,
described this year’s freshman
class as ‘‘an especially good
group.”’ He says that professors
who are advisors have reported
back to him that the students
this year have been much more
familiar with the registration
procedures than some have
been in the past. Also, he says,
they’ve been ‘“‘asking more
penetrating, substantive ques-
tions regarding classes, ma-
jors, and career choices, - and
have really been thinking
seriously about their futures
here.”’

Next year’s first week of
school is already being planned,
and Dean Huntley says he
would appreciate some student
feedback to guide him. ‘‘I wish

One area in which he might
like to see some changes is the
selection of faculty advisers.
The system used, he thinks,
‘goes against the grain and the
logic of a liberal arts college.
The idea of a liberal arts educa-
tion is to explore broadly and
widely with no preconceived no-
tions.”’ When a student is given
a faculty adviser from a field in
which he has expressed _ in-
terest, that may put limits on
him. Dean Huntley pointed out
that an English professor in
unlikely to steer an advisee
toward changing his major to
chemistry, even if that might be
the best course for the student.
“I’m not sure we’re doing the
students a favor,’’ he says.

Huntley says this year’s
freshmen have a real advan-
tage in the quality of their dorm
counselors. ‘‘I wouldn’t stay in
this job for five minutes if it

weren’t for those 26 men,’’ he
says. “The service they per-
form for the university is
greater than any other single
organization on campus.”’ He
says they’re outstanding men
who often take the job because
‘{t’s a small way they can
repay the system for what their
dorm counselor did for them.’’

A major part of the first week
for freshman is registering for
classes, and Registrar Harold
Head believes it went ‘‘very
well — it’s the best we’ve ever
had. Everything went
smoothly. The students seemed
to respond to instructions, and
did what they were supposed to
do.”’

A question which frequently
comes up is why students aren’t
given their choice of time
period for each course. Mr.
Head says that the computer
just can’t do that — it’s hard
enough to balance the class sec-
tions and come up with a sche-
dule for each student that’s free
of conflicts. Mr. Head says we
have an excellent registration
system which makes it much
easier on the students than that
at almost any other school.

He’s also often asked why
they can’t give every student a
schedule which includes a lunch
hour. Every term, about 20-25
students are faced with a block
of classes that precludes eating
at the regular lunch hour. Mr.
Head says that until 1970, there
were no classes from 1-2,

eliminating the scheduling pro-
blem. Since then, though, it has
come up, but there’s really
nothing that can be done. ‘‘They
do have a choice, though,” he
says. They can add/drop free of
charge, or change their eating
habits.

Registration for the winter
term will be October 28 for
freshmen and on the three
previous days for upperclass-
men, and Mr. Head _ says
students should ‘‘already be
thinking about courses they
want to take in the winter.”’
Prior to registration, there will
be sheets posted showing when
sections of classes will be
meeting, and he says students
should consult these to work out
any conflicts in their schedules.
‘95 percent of it,’’ he says, ‘‘is
what’s in the catalog, but the 5
percent that’s been changed is
what can cause the problems.”

Associate Director of Admis-
sions Van Pate discussed the
new class from an admissions
point of view. ‘‘The only distinc-
tive characteristic of this class
is that there are no distinctive
characteristics,’’ he said. “‘It’s
one of the most diverse groups
we’ve enrolled in a long time.
It’s a strong class, academical-
ly, and there’s great geographic
diversity.’’ He says W&L men
tend to have been leaders in
high school, so we have a lot of
editors, class presidents, and
community leaders in the new
class.

Water polo places third with 3-2 mark

Slippery Rock claims title again

By Mike Stachura

The Washington and Lee water polo team began
play last weekend by placing third in the annual
W&L “Fall Classic’? tournament. Taking top
laurels again this year was Slippery Rock State
College, finishing with a 5-0 slate.

The Midshipmen of the Naval Academy pulled
into second place, losing only to the Rockets, while
the Generals came in at third place with a 3-2
record for the tournament. Rounding out the field
were Monmouth College (2-3), Johns Hopkins
University (1-4), and Kenyon College (0-5) who
finished fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively.

Commenting on his team’s showing in the tour-
nament, intense fourth-year head coach Page
Remillard said after Monday’s practice session,
“No, we weren’t satisfied with our performance.
We’re not where we expected to be at this point.
But,”’ he added, ‘“‘that’s not to say we aren’t
benefiting from this experience.”

Remillard cited mental errors due to fatigue
and an inability to concentrate on reading
defenses as key factors in the Generals’ two
losses. He also noted, ‘‘If we were going to lose
some games, this is the time to do it.”’

Generally Speaking

 

Something striking about NFL season

by G. Bruce Potter

The Generals began on an up note, winning their
first three contests of the tourney. W&L easily
disposed of their first opponent, Johns Hopkins,
19-9, then returned to take morning and afternoon
triumphs on Saturday over Monmouth and Ken-
yon, the former being a hard-fought one point vic-
tory.

Things reversed themselves Saturday night,
however, as the Generals came up against a
strong Navy team. The opportunistic Middies,
utilizing a fine passing attack coupled with a
tough-when-they-had-to-be defense, overcame the
obstinate Generals 18-16. In the tournament's final
match-up W&L went up against East Coast power
Slippery Rock. Fighting gamely, the Generals
made the Rock earn their 14-9 win.

W&L will play the role of host again this
weekend for the ‘‘Generals Invitational’? which
begins on Saturday morning. Visiting teams in-
clude George Washington, Florida, UNC-
Wilmington, and the Northern Virginia Club.
‘‘We’re hoping to win it,” said Coach Remillard,
who will be looking for improvement in the
squad’s play.

Notice anything missing from
the Cockpit ad on the facing
page?

That’s right, there’s nothing
in the ad about the Cockpit’s
wide-screen television on which
students can enjoy Monday
Night Football with Howard
and the gang.

And by now you've probably
figured out why. Right again,
the National Football League
players have gone on strike.
And although an avid pro foot-
ball fan, this reporter goes on

record as supporting the play-
ers for several reasons.

First, the average pro foot-
ball player only makes $84,000 a
year. Only, yousay?

Yes, only, because that is half
what the average baseball or
basketball player earns, and
the career of a football player is
considerably shorter, four
years on the average. Also, the
risk involved in playing pro
football is enormous. Just ask
Darryl Stingly, New England
Patriots wide receiver who was
paralyzed due to a football in-

jury several years ago.
Although the players’ original
request of 55% of the gross
revenues, about $19 million per
team per year, was un-
precedented, that demand had
been on the table for over 18
months with no response from
the owners. The owners finally
countered with an offer about
two weeks ago that did nothing
that the players wanted.
However, the players were
willing to bargain in an attempt
to prevent a strike, and they

Generals use early lead
to down E&H, 21-15

by Andy Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s foot-
ball team opened its 1982 season
with a 21-15 win over Emory
and Henry College Saturday.

The Generals seemed ready
to bury the Wasps when they
opened a 21-6 halftime lead. But
Emory and Henry shut out the
Generals the rest of the way,
and almost rallied to win.

‘“‘We’ve got to get a little more
stamina. We can’t allow them to
get back in the ball game,”
W&L coach Gary Fallon said.

Junior quarterback Al
Paradise handled all three first
half touchdowns. Paradise
scored on runs of two and six
yards and hit junior Dave Judge
with a 24 yard touchdown
strike.

W&L scored on its opening
drive when Paradise plunged
into the endzone from two yards
out. A 33-yard halfback option
pass from senior Chris Caval-
line to classmate Jerry Thomp-
son and a 17 yard completion to
Cavalline highlighted the drive.

W&L’s second touchdown was
set up by a fine special-teams
play. Sophomore Bill ‘Morrow
blocked an E&H punt and junior
linebacker John Cole recovered
for W&L at the six yard line. On
the next play Paradise score on
an option run and senior kicker
Bill Devine nailed the extra
point for a 14-0 General lead.

Emory & Henry recovered a
fumble at the W&L 38 to set up
their first score. A 25 yard pass
from Chip Thayer to Steve
Larus put Emory & Henry back
into the game at 14-6.

Senior Ken Manganiello in-
tercepted an E&H pass at the
Wasps’ 28 to set up what proved
to be the winning touchdown for

While the W&L offense stalled
in the second half, Emory &
Henry rallied. The Wasps
scored on a 2 yard run by Henry
Ferguson at 11:29 of the third
quarter and on a 22 yard field
goal by Mike McElroy with 3:08
left in the fourth quarter to nar-
row the lead to 21-15.

On the next possession, W&L
consumed all by 45 seconds of
the clock, getting a crucial first
down on a 93-yard pass from
Paradise to Jerry Thompson.

When E&H finally got the ball
back they could pick up only one
first down before W&L line-
backer Don Kellermen picked
off an E&H pass to seal the vic-
tory for the Generals.

Defensively, the Generals
yielded 279 yards in the game,
but managed to turn in plenty of
drive-stopping plays. The
defense intercepted three Wasp
passes and recovered one fum-
ble.

Coach Gary Fallon had mixed
feelings about his team’s initial
performance. Fallon liked the
way his defense played in clutch
situations, but he stated, “I
don’t think we played a totally
good game offensively. We
were a little sporadic.”’

Paradise finished the day 12
of 17 passing for 123 yards.
Chris Cavalline was the Gener-
als’ leading rusher with 55

yards on 19 carries. Cavalline
was also the leading receiver
with five receptions for 45
yards.

This Saturday W&L travels to
Danville, Kentucky, to take on
Centre College in a non-league
game. ;

W&L will go into the game
with three major injuries.
Senior tailback Pat McGuire,
sophomore fullback Danny
Jayne, and sophomore defen-
sive end Bill Morrow will pro-

bably all be lost for the season.

Generally Speaking

(continued from page 10)

responded by demanding only
50% of the television revenues,
which will be $2.1 billion over
the next five years. Although
television revenues are the
teams’ main source of income,
it was a true effort by the
players to really begin a
bargaining process.

The owners, however, re-
jected categorically the pro-
posal, and the strike was on.

However, one can merely
hope that both sides will sit
down at the bargaining table
and make an effort to reach an
agreement and inject excite-
ment back into Sunday after-
noons, especially since the Red-
skins are in first place.
