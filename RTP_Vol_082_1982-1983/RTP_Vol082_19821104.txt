Jobs

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer
“Need a job, kid? Tough
luck.”’

That is what a recent cam- -

paign poster said, urging the
electorate to vote for a change
in federal policies. The slogan
plays on what is becoming the
dominant concern for many
Americans and many W&L
students —- unemployment.

The Gallup Poll reported in
March that while inflation re-
mains the number one problem
in the eyes of the American
public, unemployment worries
are rising fast. The proportion
of people surveyed who cited
unemployment as the most im-
portant national problem, in-
creased from eight percent one
year ago to 28 percent in March.

Such perceptions of unem-
ployment are not unwarranted.
Last month, President Reagan
announced that the national
level of unemployment had
risen to 10.1 percent. In July
1981 the unemployment rate
was seven percent. But that is
for the total work force.

What are the prospects for the
typical Washington and Lee stu-
dent graduating in 1983? ‘‘It ap-
pears that we are headed for a
tight year, that there may not
be as many jobs as we had
hoped,’’ Michael A. Cappeto,
Director of the Office of Career
Development and Placement,
said last week.

Cappeto is the man to see on
campus about finding a job. The
Placement Office organizes and
conducts workshops on job
hunting techniques, and invites

Analysis
Kirby probe examines curious record

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

After a delay for the licensing of the investigator, the investiga-
tion into alleged misconduct by police chief James Kirby is under-
way.

The investigator named by the city, Leonard M. “Bucky”
Walters, was forced by the State of Virginia to obtain a license to
perform the investigation. The acquisition of this license delayed
the investigation two weeks, Mayor Charles Phillips said.

The investigation of Police Chief Kirby, who has put himself on
administrative leave, follows 11 previous criminal trials of Lex-
ington police officers in connection with a theft ring that operated
in Lexington throughout the seventies. With the resignation of
former Lexington officer James Colbert last week, all 13 of the of-
ficers originally indicted last spring are now no longer with the
force.

The investigation of that theft ring, made by Virginia State Police
Investigators Tex Chapman and Louis Layne, raised questions
relating to the police chief, who was not one of the 13 originally in-
dicted. The investigatien will consider the extent of Kirby’s
knowledge of crimes committed by officers. It will also consider
the possibility that the chief himself committed crimes.

Several references made in the statements of other officers when
questioned by the State police investigators imply that Kirby was
aware of the thefts. Kirby has denied any knowledge of the theft
ring during his six years as chief.

Although these references cannot be used as evidence in a court
of law, they demand an exploration into the possibility of such
knowledge of involvement on Kirby’s part in order that the city of
Lexington can be assured of the chief’s innocence.

One of the fundamental issues of the investigation should be the
determination of how Chief Kirby could have supervised and
managed the police department without discovering the theft ring.

Although the Lexington police force never exceeded 20 members,
statements in the public record suggest that Chief Kirby ran the
department loosely, rarely keeping in touch with the force as a col-
lective group. Former State Trooper and convicted conspirator
Marvin Hamilton, who served on the Lexington police force be-
tween 1972 and 1981, described Kirby’s management methods to
State Police investigators: “He didn’t like departmental
meetings....He never liked to talk to more than one person at a
time.”’

Other officers said in the record that the chief ignored allegations
they made of crimes within the department. Former Trooper
Hamilton stated, ‘‘I remember bringing a lot of stuff to his atten-
tion, but specifics I don’t remember. Everytime you get the same
answer: ‘You gotta have proof,’ or something to that effect.”

Former Officer Jack Purvis, convicted of conspiracy, also
answered police investigators’ questions about management:
“Kirby, if you went to him to make an allegation like that, he would
get mad at you. He didn’t like to do that. Lots of times you could tell
Kirby and later he would say you didn’t tell him.”’

Officer Donald Stubblefield explained to the State Investigators
that when he joined the force in 1979, he was placed on the late shift
because he was a new man. He said he was warned by another of-
ficer that he should not become too reliant on other units for backup
to stop a fight requiring many officers. Stubblefield’s fear was that
an officer might be busy committing a crime and not be available
for backup.

Stubblefield stated, ‘“When I got landed on this shift, seemed like
no one wanted on it. And you know, I was new man, so that’s where
I got placed....And like I say, they told me not to be in a hurry to go
to a fight, because they were slow to back you up, if you get in
there and get hurt. And like, I say, that it had been rumored that
they, you know, do take stuff.”

The investigation into the police chief must determine how a
young rookie patrolman could have learned so quickly of the theft
ring without the chief himself stumbling upon evidence over a six
year period.

Hamilton, in his testimony, describes a graft system that stretch-
es throughout the force, as far as the office of chief. Other
references made in Hamilton’s testimony suggest that Kirby might
have had a deeper criminal involvment than simply ignoring the
facts.

Hamilton recalls, in his statement, a conversation with Purvis
concerning the theft of a lawn mower. Hamilton, who had stolen the
mower, recalled considering whether he should have gone to the
chief with a confession. Hamilton then quoted Purvis as saying
‘Well the chief even, you know, gets stuff you know, if he needs it.”’

After asking for an explanation from Purvis, Hamilton said in his
testimony: ‘‘I don’t think he implied that the chief actually picked
it up but he (Purvis) said, like, the chief needed some fertilizer or
something, the co-op kept these one hundred pound bags and stuff

Phi looks up
thanks to staff

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor-in-Chief

Moving into the second half of the Fall term, the
Ring-tum Phi draws back and makes some observa-
tions. So far, several glorious ideas have failed. It has
been difficult getting columnists for the Phi, and the
Phi Literary Supplement seems comatose in the
absence of writer interest. The Phi has been unsuc-
cessful in establishing beats because of the lack of
reporters. Problems with the U.S. Postal Service and
people who horde Phi’s have tangled our circulation.

But this bad news is far outweighed by the good.
September ad sales were twice as much as the year
before. This year’s Phi has mostly been 12 pages
long, compared to 8 pages last year. This is due to the
good work of our business staff under Steve Perry.

Senior reporters like Rick Swagler and Tom Baker
have made invaluable contributions. Features have
made the Phi readable again, due in large measure to
Features Editor B. Scott Tilley. Freshman Mike Allen
has proved himself to be fast, accurate and ir-
replaceable for the Phi’s news coverage. And
freshman Nelson Patterson has already built up a
loyal readership with his personality profiles.

One of our hardest workers is David Sprunt, a
sophomore. As head photographer, he makes sure the
photographs are taken and then sacrifices his
Wednesdays to get them printed. What a guy.

A good newspaper tries new things, and this year
we are trying to rotate the news editorship. The job is
difficult and thankless; it requires making sure
everyone turns in what they’re supposed to, and then
writing something yourself. By rotating, I hope to
keep senior reporters from getting burned out.
Therefore, senior Bill Roberts steps in as John
Cleghorn steps over to newswriting. Cleghorn han-
dled the job during the most difficult part of the year,
all the while covering the biggest stories of the year:
ABC crackdown, the VMI wreck and police depart-
ment corruption trials. Cleghorn was asked to be the
backbone of the newspaper, and performed well. He
continues at the Phi writing news. Bill Roberts has a
talent for localizing issues of national importance to
our campus. He brings to the news editorship profes-
sionalism and thoroughness.

There are other changes in the works. Sports Editor
G. Bruce Potter is moving to news reporting. Lee
Nichols, a senior, will replace him. Mike Stachura
will serve as Assistant Sports Editor. We could not be
more pleased with this arrangement.

There is still room for your participation in The Phi.
Those with skills in reporting, photography, layout or
business, and those with the enthusiasm to pick up
those skills, should come to Thursday staff meetings,
which meet at 6:30 in room 129 of Davis Dorm. Or con-
tact me at 463-9306.

Thanks for bearing with me through this article, but
the people I have named, and many more, deserve
immense credit for turning this newspaper around.
There is no more difficult thing in the world than try-
ing to be creative and accurate at once, and doing it
under deadline pressure. But these few, these happy
few, this band of brothers, are doing exactly that.

Dean outlines ABC laws

By LEWIS G. JOHN
W&L Dean of Students

As part of Alcohol Awareness
Week, every Washington and
Lee student should make a con-
certed effort to become familiar
with applicable state law and
ABC regulations concerning the
possession, sale, and consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages in
Virginia.

It is important to keep in
mind that students are subject
to enforcement of the law, as
are all other citizens, and that
Washington and Lee cannot and
will not protect them from its
application.

Minimum Age Requirements

If you are under 18, it is
against the law for you to buy,
drink or possess any beer, wine,
or other alcoholic beverage. If
you are 18, you may purchase
beer on premises for on-
premises consumption in a
licensed establishment such as
The Cockpit. You must be 19,
however, to purchase beer (in a
grocery store such as Kroger,
for example) for off-premises
consumption. And finally, you
must be 21 to purchase, drink,
or possess wine or hard liquor
(‘‘distilled spirits,’ in ABC ter-
minology).

Two other general provisions
of the law are of particular im-
portance. No matter how old
you are, it is against the law for
you to buy alcoholic beverages
for persons under the legal
drinking age as outlined above.
In addition, it is against the law
— a Class 4 misdemeanor — to
drink or to offer a drink to
anyone else (whether accepted
or not) “at or in any public
place.’ This means that you
may not drink in public or in
sight of any public conveyance.

Party Licenses

Because of the recent ‘‘bust’’
of a fraternity-sponsored party
at Zollman’s Pavilion and the
charges placed against six
Washington and Lee students
for the illegal sale of alcoholic
beverages without a license, it
is of special importance that all
individuals and groups holding
such parties be familiar with
the pertinent laws and ABC
regulations. A conviction on

such a charge can result in a
fine ranging from $50 to $500,
and a possible jail term ranging
from 30 days to twelve months.
In addition to the criminal sanc-
tions that can be imposed, a
conviction can obviously have a
devastating effect on a stu-
dent’s career aspirations.

ABC agents have been par-
ticularly concerned about par-
ties at Zollman’s because of
complaints from area citizens.
Supposedly private parties
have been advertised widely,
and members of the public
(including, allegedly, some
under-age members of the
public) have been allowed ac-
cess. Private parties at
unlicensed places must be truly
private, e.g. if a university
function, limited to Washington
and Lee students, dates, and
guests invited specifically by
written invitation. No alcoholic
beverages can be sold by cash,
ticket, or any other means.

ABC interpretation of state
law, incidentally, is that if there
is a “cover charge’ at the door
and the cost of the beer is in-
cluded in that cover charge,
then beer is being sold. In addi-
tion, beer cannot be given to
anyone under 19 years of age,
and no one can drink outside, in
public.

If, on the other hand,
alcoholic beverages are to be
sold at the party or if you wish
to serve beer to anyone 18 years
of age, a private banquet
license is required by state law.

Restrictions will be very tight
for such licenses. The ABC
Board will consider the is-

suance of a 24-hour license to
student groups only upon writ-
ten approval from both the Of-
fice of the Dean of Students and
local law enforcement agency.
ABC agents are to be allowed
free access to all licensed af-
fairs, which must be restricted
to beer purchased under the
banquet license only. There can
be no brown bagging of wine,
beer, or liquor at such func-
tions.

Because the regulations are
fairly complex, Mr. Jerry Dar-
rell, director of university food
services, has prepared a helpful
two-page handout which gives a
‘“layman’s analysis’? of ABC
regulations as they may affect
college students and frater-
nities. In addition, the universi-
ty has arranged for represen-
tatives of the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control to
meet with fraternity presidents
and other student organization
leaders at 6:45 p.m. next Tues-
day, Nov. 9, in Room 114 of the
Student Center.

_ I would urge anyone with

questions about the ABC regula-
tions to attend the Nov. 9
meeting or to talk with me. I
shall have copies of the relevant
sections of the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act available
in my office. Further, if any stu-
dent organization or fraternity
is planning a party and has a
specific question concerning
compliance with ABC regula-
tions, do not hesitate to get in
touch with the local ABC agent.
You can get his telephone
number either from Mr. Darrell
or from me.

Cradition

By BETTY MUNGER

Alcohol and students - have
iad a riotous, painful associa-
ion for as long as there have
een universities. Heidelburg,
he Sorbonne, Oxford have
ong histories of drunk and
lighly disorderly conduct,
vhich leads inevitably, to tur-
sulent relations with their local
stablishments.

So what’s new about today’s
tudent behavior? It’s what
tudents are traditionally sup-
osed to do, isn’t it? ‘‘Not for
‘nowledge that we come to col-
ege, but to raise hell while
ve’re here.” Right?

But there are some obvious
lifferences between students
‘arousing in a tavern and a
raternity bash. It was wine,
wer and mead (Falstaff’s
avorite) that set those earlier
tudents reeling. Today, spirits
vith nearly ten-fold the alcohol
‘ontent are downed with equal
ileasure and speed. Instant or-
it, staggers and slurs.

Too, those earlier pub
‘rawlers did not have 100 horse-
xower weapons at their
lisposal.

One thing I find bothersome is
he pride taken in getting
ilastered. ‘I’m really going to
ie one on this weekend!”’ ‘‘Boy,
was bombed out of my mind!’’

flamorous. It even receives a

and several W&L ad-
ministrators. At that time,
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read
reacted to the raid of a Chi Psi
Pavilion party Oct. 9 by declar-
ing that anyone caught drinking
alcoholic beverages in public
would be arrested.

Read’s statement appeared to
some people to be new inter-
pretation of the law; however,

Commonwealth’s Attorney,
says that it merely reflects a
stronger effort to start reinforc-
ing the laws that already exist.
‘This is not a new law,’’ said
Saunders. “‘It’s just that the law
has not been carried out in this
area, including W&L VMI and
(among) private citizens.’’
Saunders said that in the past
few years, ABC agents have
been late in getting to the
scenes of possible violations,

time they got there, everything
was over. The agents at our
meeting also said that up to
1978, they used to go over the
laws every year with Dean
John. But it hasn’t been done
since,’’ Saunders said.
According to Saunders, the
agents said they did not arrest
anybody in the Pavilion inci-
dent for drinking in public.

Saunders said the agents will
point out at Tuesday’s meeting
that, although the party was a
private function, the Pavilion
can be seen by the public. Thus,
anyone who consumes beer or
alcohol there is considered to be
drinking in public, he said.

“These violations will be
brought up,’’ Saunders said.

Minking Out About Town

 

In the line of duty

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor-in-Chief

Hmmmm, where did that little old lead go? Assigned to cover
Monday’s session of Alcohol Awareness Week, Roanoke Times and
World News reporter Brian Shaw waded into the thick of things for
a first-person account. The session provided participants with
booze and then let them test themselves on the newly purchased
Breathalyzer. Professor Margand, University Center secretary
Carole Chappell, and various EC representatives were among
those getting crocked in the name of Alcohol Awareness. Shaw
found his lead by the second paragraph of his story: ‘‘Anything for
a story; anything for a drink.”’

Sweet Briar hospitality

You and your pals are cruising the dorms at Sweet Briar. You
knock on the door and ask, ‘‘Wanna Party?” The girl has a mud
pack on her face and slams the door on you. Is that fair? Editor
Vicky McCullough of the Sweet Briar News says no. In an editorial
Oct. 28 she reprimanded fellow students for their inhospitality and
said it sometimes leads to vandalism.

‘How many boys, after being treated in a friendly way, would
want to kick ina door or steal a fire extinguisher?

‘So next time you’re studying for a midterm and you hear a
group of boys in the hall, instead of sticking your head out the door,
yelling ‘Shut up!,’ and slamming the door, take a few minutes to
say hello, make them feel welcome, and point them in the direction
of a place where they can party.”’

Hi, ’m obnoxious

Also in the Sweet Briar News is E] Warner’s column, “My Life As
A Man,” written from the perspective of ‘Ed, a Phi Delt from
W&L.”

Ed, having slept and eaten and played lacrosse gets ready for the
big party. ‘‘Some girls from Hollins get there. I go up to one. ‘Hi,
I’m Ed, can I get you a beer? I decide the girls 2re ugly and leave to
get them beers, never to return. I stand in the corner and talk to
men, because I’m so secure. If I don’t want to date I won’t have one,
so there. I let girls get their beers before I get mine, and if I’m feel-
ing really polite I even pour it for them. I usually don’t feel too
polite.’’

Ed gets drunk, goes to Hardee’s, gets obnoxious, goes home, and
goes to sleep.

You never know, minks, be inhospitable and these women may
turn to vandalism.

While we’re scouting the newspapers of area colleges, take a look

The EC reported progress on bringing lights to the

EC mini-meeting lights up front parking lot

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi News Writer

In a 13-minute meeting Mon-
day night, the Washington and
Lee Executive Committee en-
couraged students to par-
ticipate in this week’s Alcohol
Awareness activities and dis-
cussed several other matters
briefly.

President Bennett Ross an-
nounced that the faculty had
voted earlier in the day to table
the proposed curriculum
changes for the time being.

According to Ross, the faculty

will await the report of two
committees, the Committee on
Honors and on Interdepartmen-
tal Courses. Thus, a decision on
the changes in distribution re-
quirements will not be made un-
til at least the spring, Ross said.

Ross also said that he had
received some ‘good com-
ments” about the letter sent by
the EC to the faculty about the
proposed changes. The letter
came after a special EC
meeting last Thursday and was
drafted by senior represen-
tative John Viahoplus.

Ross noted that the meeting
had been preceded by a
demonstration of a ‘‘breath-
alyzer,’’ which police measure
blood-alcohol content. Ross urg-
ed the members to ‘‘talk up”
this week’s activitis in conjunc-
tion with Alcohol Awareness
Week.

Sophomore representative
Dave Jonson reported that he
had spoken to Frank Parsons,
assistant to the president of the
university, about installing
lights in the parking lot by the
war memorial/front gates.

According to Brower, Par-
sons was “glad that the
students had mentioned this
and reminded him because he
had let it slip.”’ He will notify
(buildings and grounds super-
visor) James Arthur and asked
Brower to get back to him if
things don’t start moving soon.

Pete Baumgaertner thanked
the physical education depart-
ment for repairing the old
weight equipment and install-
ing a new bench. He also in-
formed the EC that the Student

Athletic Committee will meet
on Nov. 4 to discuss the
possibility of an area of tne gym
for weight-using students who
do not participate on athletic
teams.

However, Baumgaertner,
said ‘‘we’re probably lucky,”
because some other universities
do not even allow non-athletes
to use athletic equipment at all.

Ross closed the meeting by
announcing that only the larger

‘committees will have to file a

budget report every month.

Faculty, students debate distribution

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor-in-Chief

They aren’t listening to us,
said John Vlahoplus as he
watched the faculty’s side of the
University Council debate on
proposed changes in the W&L
distribution system.

One of the biggest questions
at Thursday’s meeting of the
Council, which is made up of
students and faculty, was how
the students fit into this pro-
posal’s approval process, and
why ‘‘the opportunity for
students to voice their views
and opinions on this,” in Dean
John’s words, came only a few
days before the scheduled facul-
ty vote on the matter.

As it turned out, the faculty
did not vote on the proposal to
alter the general education re-
quirements for students. At its
monthly meeting on Monday,
the faculty voted to postpone
the vote in order to wait for a
report from a committee on
honors courses.

But some students coming in-
to the Council meeting were
under the impression that it was
too late for them to actually do
anything about the proposal.

‘“‘There was certainly no in-
tention to limit student debate,
nor to limit faculty debate,”’
Dean of the College William
Watt said. He said the student
Executive Committee had been
invited by Professor Sidney
Coulling to submit ideas, and
had not.

“If there was nothing done
among the Student Body, then I
think you’re going to have to put
some of the blame on the Ex-
ecutive Committee,’’ Com-
merce School Dean Edward At-
wood said.

After two hours of discussion,
the Council voted 9 to 8 to ex-
press disapproval of the section
of the proposal which requires a
foreign language, while voting
not to disapprove of the whole
proposal, 11 to6.

 

proposal.”’

it end’ argument.”

 

 

With a few exceptions, the
votes divided the Council facul-
ty from students.

Students, most notably
seniors Vlahoplus and Chris
Stokes, voiced opinions against
the proposal:

Stokes argued that faculty
trust in students is shown in the
amount of freedom students are
given to select their own
schedules ;

~ Vlahoplus said that most of
the students he had talked to
felt the new general education
requirements would scare off
applicants ;

~He argued that the courses
that the faculty would require
under the proposal would be
restrictive and yet not make
students take many valuable
courses, such as philosophy;
and

»Danny Parsley, a soph-
omore, suggested that forcing

students into courses would
weaken the quality of the
courses, whether they be
foreign language or science.

Faculty members argued the
Opposite: .

Watt said that the present,
looser distribution system was
introduced in the ’60s when high
schools were sending students
with better preparation, and
that the proposal would send a
message to high schools to start
tightening up;

~He argued that students
had misinterpreted the pro-
posal, which he said would
mean less general education
courses for the well-prepared
students ;

~ He and Atwood said that ap-
plications would not drop off
because other schools were
moving in the same direction,
some already having stiffer
distribution systems; and

The faculty postponed its scheduled Monday vote on a proposal
that would drastically alter the way a student at Washington and
Lee “rounds out’ his education. Professor George Ray com-
mented at the monthly faculty meeting Monday that the faculty
ought to wait for a report from Professor Thomas Williams’ com-
- mittee on honors courses. The committee is scheduled to com-
plete its work before the end of the academic year. ;

The proposal would require a student to complete the
equivalent of the second year of a foreign language, to study
English or foreign literature, and to complete four hours of a
laboratory science. Under the present distribution, a student
needs 36 credits from four categories to graduate. The proposal
would decrease that number for well prepared students, and in-
crease the number for others.

Professor Lad Sessions: “‘It’s restriction without complete con-
striction. .. .There are certain elements of freedom in the new

Senior John Vlahoplus: ‘‘Sure, it’s great to have a lab science,
it’s great to havea foreign language — but it’s the old ‘where does

 
 

» Professor Lad Sessions told
students that the proposal con-
tained many positive aspects,
such as allowing courses in a
students’ major to be counted
for general education as well,
and allowing students to make

substitution, journalism for
English composition being a
tentative example.

“IT am personally embarrass-
ed when someone asks me,”’ At-
wood said,”’ if a student at W&L
has to have competency in a
language, and I have to say no,
or competency in math, and I
have to say no, or competency
in a natural science, and I have
to say no, or if he has to take an
English course, and I have to
say no.

“It’s a reflection on the
Washington and Lee degree and
not a good one,’’ Atwood said.

The discussion was not sim-
ply faculty against student. In

fact, some of the cleare
arguments against the propos:
came from Spanish professc

Larry Boetsch.
“Personally, I’m nc
dissatisfied at all with what tk

W&L degree represents,” sai
Boetsch, an alumnus.

He said the Romanc
Languages faculty  stoo
unanimously against the pri

- posed curriculum, which wi
require that a student reac
second-year level with a foreig
language. ‘‘Nobody comes her
without two years of a foreig
language, and we’re willing t
respect their decision not t
continue with language,
Boetsch said. To have student
in class who did not want to k
there would lower the quality «
the courses, he said.

Parsley extended this arg
ment to the proposed require
ment of at least four credits of
laboratory science.

“Don’t you feel that in la
science if the chemistry depar
ment is creating these lowe
level science courses, aren
they going to become as ineffec
tive as lower level language?
he asked.

The students on the Counc
were no more unanimous tha
the faculty. Third-year law sti
dent Mike Bommarito said, ‘
graduated without having take
a lab science and I find that t
be to my detriment nov
There’s something to be said fc
these requirements.”’

“TI think what’s being propo
ed is very good,” said senic
David Cole. “ I think it’s ver
bad that you can go to W&L an
not take a language.”’

As faculty and students tric
kled out at 6 p.m., most of th
Council stayed to put the matte
to a vote. After great confusio
on whether the students shoul
vote separately and whethe
what the motion would be, th
two votes were taken, and th
meeting adjourned.

opposition message

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

At a special Thursday night
meeting last week, the Ex-
ecutive Committee drafted an
official policy statement oppos-
ing the proposed curriculum
changes. The letter, addressed
to ‘‘all faculty and administra-
tion” was subsequently put in
each professor’s mailbox before
the faculty meeting Monday.

“The liberal arts education
cannot be defined so precisely
as to include a given number of
lab science credits or a profi-
ciency in a foreign language.
Singling out certain depart-
ments as necessary for a liberal
arts education slights other
departments,” the letter said.
Senior Rep. John Vlahoplus
elaborated on this, saying, ‘‘It
seems like they’re defining cer-
tain courses as necessary for a
liberal arts education.”

Viahoplus also clarified a
point of conflict, explaining that
courses, in some cases, could be
applied to a student’s major as
well as distribution, and that
some substitution would be
allowed.

“A journalism course could

ALOHA WOK

463-9342

ctetewudlt

be used as an English composi-
tion course to satisfy distribu-
tion. The number of ‘overlap
credits’ would put some
students in a very good position.
Dean Atwood assured us that
there was no intent to hose the
C-Schoolers,’’ Vlahoplus told
the committee. Atwood was
responding to a comment Presi-
dent Bennett Ross made at last
Monday’s meeting that the pro-
posed changes were a ‘‘vendet-
ta against business majors.”

Vice President Morgan Grif-
fith pointed out that the argu-
ment that students wouldn’t be
attracted to a school that re-
quired a large number of
courses was unfounded because
“W&L’s competition is doing
the same thing.”’

The letter went on to say that
“The purpose of a liberal arts
education is the mastery of
disciplines, not depart-
ments....We believe that the
proposed curriculum changes
are an attempt to define a
liberal arts education by ‘what,’
not ‘how.’ ”’

The EC encourages students
to speak with their professors
regarding this important issue.

ROTC honors seniors

At ceremonies conducted in
the Military Science Building at
W&L last week, 27 seniors in the
university's Army ROTC pro-

gram were honored for their’

performance at the ROTC Ad-
vanced Camp last summer.

Activities at the encampment
included intensive tactical
training, physical fitness,
soldier skills, weapons training,
and orientations to the various
specialties which cadets might
pursue upon commissioning.
The emphasis throughout the
camp was on leadership and its
application.

Almost 3,500 cadets from
throughout the eastern United
States participated in the six-
week program at Fort Bragg,

Awards included citations
presented to Newton Kendrick
and Bowen Woodruff for ex-
cellence on the Advanced
Physical Readiness Test. Ken-
drick was in the top ten percent
of all cadets in physical fitness.

tion of mountaineering, sur-

outside, that he (Purvis) would pick them up in the patrol car and
pitch them out next to the Chief’s back porch. . . .”
In the investigator’s interview, Purvis directly denied this inci-
dent and states that Chief Kirby would not have knowingly taken

stolen goods.

This allegation of received stolen goods is the most serious ques-
tion that is raised by an examination of the public record. That, and
the implication made by other officers that Kirby ignored the reali-
ty of the theft ring, are the two central issues from the public record

to be investigated.

The public document, consisting of statements made by six
former and acting law enforcement officials, is close to 200 pages
long. The statements include widespread accusations, implications
and recollections of many of the robberies commited by Lexington
police officers of Lexington businesses. Often one officer’s
testimony will contradict another’s. In other cases, two officers’
statements will support the same conclusion. The public record
must be read and studied with great discretion. But its contents
provide a detailed and realistic view of the depth of the Lexington

police theft ring and most importantly, provide an outline for the in-

vestigation into the Office of the Chief of Police.

‘From what I saw, this should be a super
year. The Little Brothers were excited, as

were the W&L guys.”’

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

A change in leadership and in-

~ creased enthusiasm among

students involved have
transformed this year’s Univer-
sity Federation.

Involved in such community
programs as Big Brothers,
Total Action Against Poverty,
tutoring in public schools and
outreach to patients at Western
State Mental Hospital and local
geriatric facilities, this year’s
federation of student volunteers
promises to be ‘‘the best in a
number of years,’’ according to
Mike Cappeto, its adviser.

‘All around, (the federation)
is better. Programs are being
re-started, and community re-
sponse has been great,’’ Cap-
peto said.

Cappeto ascribes this revitali-
zation primarily to the new
leaders in the club. This year’s
Federation president Jim
Averett ’83, served last year as
vice president of the student
Executive Committee. Cappeto
sees this as a plus.

“The people we have as
leaders have been leaders in
other organizations in the past.
By having them working for us
now, we have improved the ad-
ministrative quality of the
Federation and have got the
W&L program running again,”
Cappeto said.

Averett sees a solid body of
the student support as the key to
the Federation’s success.

‘‘We have students involved
who want the program to be
successful and who will work
hard to see that come about.
The students are excited, as are
the people in the community,”
Averett noted.

One of the term’s major
events for the Federation was
Big Brother’s Kickoff Hallo-
ween Party held Friday in
Buena Vista.

‘From what I saw, this
should be a super year. The lit-
tle brothers were excited, as
were the W&L guys,” Averett
said.

Student volunteers and Uni-
versity support are two keys to
the Federation’s success that
both Cappeto and Averett
stressed. Averett hopes to get
greater student participation in
the program, especially in
tutoring and visiting the elder-
ly.
Averett believes the key to
filling that need is showing
students the rewards of the pro-
gram.

‘‘A lot of students are involv-
ed in the Federation and there
is a lot of enthusiasm among

— Jim Averett

them. Those students that
aren’t involved, however, we
need to motivate and show them
the rewards, the personal
satisfaction gained from such
an experience. Being a catalyst
in speeding up student involve-
ment is important,” Averett
remarked.

Without financial help from
the university and donation of
physical facilities for activities,
however, student involvement
would be next to null. This is
where the university enters,
Cappeto notes. .

In his years as adviser, Cap-
peto has seen constant universi-
ty financial support for the
Federation, whether in picking
up tabs for gas or paying for
amusement park tickets and
parties for Little Brothers. Ad-
ditionally; university donations
of physical facilities —buildings
for activities, clerical help,
printing services, and even
Cappeto’s advisorship —added
to the Federation’s success.

While the program gives
students a chance to meet peo-
ple and expand contacts in the
community, Cappeto said he
sees added benefits to student
involvement also.

‘“‘The danger at small univer-
sities like W&L is students only
meet people like themselves.
That makes Jack a very dull

professionals to meet with
seniors to discuss career oppor-
tunites. ‘‘My goal here is to get
good jobs, jobs that are in-
teresting and satisfying,”’ Cap-
peto said.

“IT don’t want to sound
negative but I think students
ought to prepare for the worst,”
he said.

Start early, start now, recom-
mended Cappeto. To help sen-
iors get started in their job sear-
ch, the Placement Office is of-
fering three workshops next
week, which will be held in
Room 114 of the University
Center. Seniors received
notices of the workshop sched-
ule in the mail Monday.

“‘The person who knows what
they want to do, why they want
to do it, should fare much better
on the job market than someone
who is vague, tentative about
it,’’ Cappeto said. In addition to
introducing students to the
techniques of job hunting the
workshops are designed to help
the students refine their ideas of

. what they want todo.

boy,’’ Cappeto said. “The
Federation shows student in-
volvement and concern for the
community, however. Students
are interested in the communi-

“It’s easy for the community
to see the fraternity parties and
hear the loud music and just
assume the students don’t give
a damn about the town. The
Federation disproves that
theory,’’ Cappeto said.

Drinking
discussed
tonight

An informal discussion on
‘Driving Under the Influence of
Alcohol” will be held on Thurs-
day, Nov. 4 at 8:45 p.m. in Mc-
Cormick Hall, (Room 121) led
by M.A.D.D_ representatives
Laurie Williams and Jack
Hamilton. The purpose of the
discussion is not discourage the
drinking of alcohol, but drink-
ing and driving.

The M.A.D.D. group will offer
national/state statistics involv-
ing drinking-related accidents
and deaths, and personal in-
volvement. The Executive
Committee encourages ll
students to attend.

 

“Our students are looking at
one of the most favorable
markets in the country,’’ Cap-
peto said. ‘‘Most students
typically look for jobs in the Sun
Belt, which is not suffering as
much from the recession as
other areas of the country.”

Statistical surveys of W&L
graduates conducted by the
Placement Office indicate that
about 50 percent of the class of
1983 will find employment after
graduation. About 35 to 40 per-
cent will go to graduate school,
and the remaining ten percent
will travel or opt to do nothing.
Some will go unemployed.

If the future resembles the
past, these predictions will hold
true. “In general, it looks about
the same, but it is too early to
tell,”’ Cappeto said. ‘But if the
economy turns itself around
and starts expanding, there
could be jobs everywhere.”

Given the characteristics of
the typical W&L graduate who
is white, aged 21 and a single
male with a college degree, the
class of 1983 should have an ad-
vantage. “People who want

jobs are going to find
something,” Cappeto said.

Running for the Lord

By NELSON PATTERSON
_ Phi Staff Writer

Among the confused jumble
of memories a freshman car-
ries from orientation, one must
stand out clearly:

Coach Norman F. Lord.

The broad-chested coach
meets with each group of
freshmen that comes through
the gym, urging them to sign up
for PE 154 — Aerobics.

It gives girls more W&L man
to hug, he tells them as they
laugh nervously.

“I think aerobics is the most
fun course I teach,’’ Lord said
in a recent interview. ‘‘The
students have a deep apprecia-
tion by the end of the course for
the discipline involved in
fitness, and they’re fit.”’

“Fun. Fitness. Friendship.”
The three infamous F'’s of phys-
ed with Lord.

‘They’ ve got to be in order, or
else the course is not worth it

for the student or the teacher,”
he noted. ‘“‘Have fun in class
first. Become fit, and while you
are becoming fit, make
friends.”

Teaching fitness, however, is
only a temporary goal for Lord.

“In the short term, I want the
students to be healthy. In the
long term, I want them to help
make a strong race. I don’t
want us to go down the tubes
like the Romans because of ex-
cessive pleasure seeking,’’
detailed Lord, pausing to think
before he added more.

“At W&L, we have students
who will be future leaders. I
want them to experience this
fitness so they will be apt to sup-
port programs for fitness in the
future, whether at the com-
munity or national level.’’

“I took Aerobics as a
freshman, out of ignorance,”
one anonymous senior noted. ‘I
got in great shape; really en-
joyed the class. I’d like to take

Calendar

the class over just to get in the
physical discipline again.”

One freshman taking the
class said Lord ‘‘demands a lot
from you, but the exercise gives
you a better feeling. I’ve never
run so much in my life, but I en-
joy it. I ‘feel good,’ as Coach
Lord says.”

_America’s fitness is one con-
cern Lord holds, and he fears
this weakness may prove to be
America’s downfall someday, if
it is not already. This past sum-
mer, the father of three con-
tributed to America’s fitness by
beginning one of his grand-
children on a calisthenics pro-
gram.

‘“‘He came here and couldn’t
do five situps and five push-
ups,”’ Lord said, describing his
favorite exercise, the flip-
series, ‘‘but he left here being
able to do 35 of each at one time.
It’s just another illustration of
where we as a country are go-
ing. In this age of television and

no chores, unless kids par-
ticipate physically, they are
weak. Plain weak.”

Some schools cut physical
education when the school
budget needs trimming, and

Lord deplores that attitude.
‘‘Many_ schools _ neglect
physical education. The

academically gifted few are
benefited, but no emphasis is
given the physically talented.
That’s odd when you think
about it. When you are exercis-
ed well, you can think more
clearly and feel better,’ Lord
remarked.

Having been captain of his
college track team and a foot-
ball player for four years in col-
lege, Lord holds a deep admira-
tion for all sports. He teaches an
officiating course in the
spring term which goes over
many sports’ rules, a review
Lord enjoys every year.

a college rule in soccer about
offsides,”” he said, explaining
the finer points of the ruling.
“As far as the officiating class
is concerned, though, it’s like
the alphabet: you’ve got to
know it before you can spell;
you’ve got to know the rules
before you can play.”

Learning the rules scares
some students away from the
course, but Lord says those who
stay in the course often make
good money later in life of-
ficiating for local games.

Every fall and spring, Lord
has all his students regardless
of the course, run (and run and
run). Some students get nothing
from the running except
callous, tender feet. Others win
shoestrings, in colors that
represent levels of fitness, from
Lord.

“If you can run long dis-
tances, you are performing an
aerobic exercise — a constant
moving exercise — and thus you
can recover oxygen more easily
when you are involved in an
anaerobic sport like squash
where sudden bursts of speed
are needed,”’ he explained.

Lord’s theory on running has
won converts. A few years ago,
Lord had a squash class where
he ran the students for the first
five classes. A competition be-
tween Lord’s class and another
coach’s class saw Lord’s class
win, despite their running in
previous classes and not play-
ing squash. The losing class
“ran for the next couple of
classes,” said the coach, to be
in shape like Lord’s class was.

“I have a thesis. W&L men
should marry big and better
women, physically in-shape
women and raise big and better
sons and send them to W&L,”’
he said chuckling at the se-
quence of words as he said
them. ‘‘We’ll take those boys
and keep the process going.’’

‘Hawks rumble on Saturday

By Edwin Bell

The Nighthawks, a favorite
rhythm and blues band with
W&L students, will play Satur-
day in Evans Dining Hall.

Although in the past the
lacrosse team has financed
their spring training in Florida
by throwing a Pavilion party
with The Nighthawks, Satur-
day’s event is sponsored by the
Student Activities Board.

As demonstrated last year
with a concert by the Mighty In-
vaders, the Dining Hall pro-
vides more room and better
facilities than dZollman’s
Pavilion, which authorities
have closed to W&L parties.

The band was formed in 1972
by Jimmy Thackery (guitar
and vocals) and Mark Wenner
(harmonica, vocals); and
shortly after that Jan Zukowski
(bass) and Pete Ragussa
(drums) joined the band with
their R&B backgrounds to fill
out the blues and driving rock
sound of the band. Each
member of The Nighthawks
meshes their particular sound
with one another well. After all,
they have worked together ten
years. They now perform 300
shows a year in cities ranging
form New Orleans to D.C. The
Nighthawks originate from
Washington D.C. and have
many memorable experiences
derived from their nights in
Washington D.C. clubs.

Only a few years ago The
Nighthawks were playing at
Desparado’s while George
Thorogood and the Destroyers
were performing in the Cellar
Door across the street. Every
night at a prearranged time the
two bands would break into an
extended jam of ‘Madison
Blues,” and Thorogood and

 

The Nighthawks _

Thackery would meet in the
middle of M street to trade licks
and stop traffic. Other laurels
collected in these ten years are
touring with Greg Allman for a
short time and Jimmy
Thackery’s receiving second
honors for best R&B guitarist in
Guitar Magazine.

The doors for the Saturday
night show will open at 8 p.m.

and students are asked to use
the front door on the side of
Caroll Chappel’s office. Tickets
can be purchased at the door for
$4, beverages are included. Col-
lege ID and proof of age are re-
quired due to the recent ABC
crackdowns. Lanier Edge, SAB
chairman asks students to

“Days of Heaven’’ is truly a film that

another place.

‘Days of Heaven’ starts Friday

(The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present the American
film Days of Heaven (1978; 94
min.) at 8 p.m. on Friday and
Saturday in Classroom “A” of
Lewis Hall in the W&L Law
School. There is no charge for ad-
mission and the public is invited.)

By RICHARD GREFE

“Days of Heaven.” directed by
Terence Malick (of “Badlands”
fame) is widely considered to
be one of the stunning visual
achievements of modern film-
making. Much of the film’s ac-
tion takes place on the wheat
field of the Great Plains and
these outdoor sequences, often
shot in the natural light of
sunset (the ‘‘magic hour’’), are
justifiably famous.

Nor are “Days of Heaven’s”
sensual elements limited to the

visual. Malick’s use, of ,sound del

greatly contributes to the
dream-like quality of the film
and, combined with its visual
images, even creates for the
viewer a consciousness of the
senses of smell and touch.

The film’s plot concerns a
steel worker, Richard Gere, his
lover, Brooke Adams, and his
kid sister, who is the film’s nar-
rator, Linda Manz, a threesome
who take to the rails in 1916 and
find themselves employed as
migrant farm workers. Posing
as brother and sister, the two
lovers find that their situation is
threatened — and finally doom-
ed — when a wealthy farmer
falls in love with Adams.

One critic has written that
“Days of Heaven” is ‘“‘over-
photographed and_ under-
characterized” and, indeed, the
film’s physical beauty nearly
overwhelms the drama of the

characters’ relationships. But,

4 * od Sons ‘ '
asasy rg 5s {ORR

it should be remembered that
these are days of heaven as ex-
perienced and recalled by a
child; memories of many sen-
sory experiences will remain
vivid, while the more subtle
aspects of the adult world will
be little-understood and only
vaguely remembered. (Surely,
only a child would remember
migrant farm labor as heaven-
ly.)

“Days of Heaven” is truly a
film that transports the
viewer to another time and
another place. The film’s im-
ages of sight and sound are so
powerful that the memories of a
9-year-old girl may well become
those of the viewer.

‘Man for All Seasons’

couldn’t be better

By TORI RICHARDSON
Special to The Phi

The Washington and Lee
University Theatre production
of Robert Bolt’s ‘‘A Man for All
Seasons’”” was a_ well-appre-
ciated treat for all those who at-
tended the opening night’s per-
formance. Cast members did an
excellent job in portraying the
historical scope of sixteenth
century England throughout the
conflicts that eventually split
the British hierarchy from the
Catholic Church.

The production of ‘“‘A Man for
All Seasons’”’ was dedicated to
President Huntley in apprecia-
tion for his support and interest
in the Washington and Lee
Theatre. President and Mrs.
Huntley were present to see the
theater season kick off to a
splendid start.

Every character, from Sir
Thomas More to the Chapuy’s
assistant, was played with a
mark of perfection. Mark
Daughtrey, who played the role
of Sir Thomas More, must be
commended for his exceptional
performance. The audience
didn’t doubt for a second that
Sir Thomas More, the English
statesman executed for his
strong religious beliefs, was a
person of practical intelligence
and integrity. His utter sinceri-
ty must have won the hearts of
all who attended the perfor-
mance.

The Common Man, played by
Chris Lillja, was one of the
highlights of the evening. His
satirical remarks and actions
provided the comic relief need-
ed for this serious historical
story.

Review: Van Halen

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON

Van Halen roared into the
Roanoke Civic Center Hallo-
ween weekend accompanied by
a devastating barrage of sound
and a light show to rival the
best.

These teenie bopper kings of
heavy metal, fronted by pretty-
boy, former model David Lee
Roth, put on a typically solid,
though flawed, show. The con-
cert started slow, and pretty
rough, with guitarist Edward
Van Halen having trouble with
his equipment. But once things
got ironed out the band went
screeching through their high
velocity, hard rocking pop
tunes.

It was obvious that the show

marrowless. One laughs at his
hilarious behavior, all the while
cursing him for his lack of
character.

Thomas Cromwell, portrayed
by Todd Jones, was the power-
hungry person whose only am-
bition appeared to get Sir More
to submit to the King’s wishes.
His acting was quite believable.

Keith Shillington, Washington
and Lee’s chemistry professor
as Cardinal Wolsey, was
without a doubt excellent for the
part. His delivery of some of his
lines brought, by far, some of
the greatest roars from the au-
dience.

King Henry VIII could not
have been played better. Chris
Cartmill’s presentation of the
British king who sought to
break away from the Roman
Catholic Church because he
wasn’t granted a divorce by the
Pope should be given a Tony
award for his performance.

Much applause goes to Pat
Woehrlen, Andrea LaRue and
David Marsh for their role as
the supportive family of Sir
Thomas More. The beauty and
innocence of LaRue, the
warmth and self determination
of Woehrlen, and the stubborn-
ness of Marsh were well
brought out in their characters.
We W&L theater-goers hope to
see more of them in the future.

Chris Carmouche, Larry
Butler, Brian O’Riordan and
Landon Jones rounded out the
production with a fine support-
ing cast.

And Washington and Lee
Theater-goers’ favorite person,
Laura de Maria, as usual, ap-
plied her special talents to
balance out the night’s
festivities.

was carefully choreographed so
the band’s movements would be
together and could be followed
by the lights. This was often
vital, as in Edward Van Halen’s
solo ‘‘Cathedral.’’ With Van
Halen perched at the front of
the stage, the lights dropped
from the rafters, falling in place
behind him, creating an out-
standing visual effect. The
lights, which could be raised
and lowered in small groups,
were manipulated constantly
throughout the show, creating a
myriad of effects and greatly
enhancing the show. The
general admission crowd,
which seemed to fill the arena,
was brought to a sereaming
crescendo at the end. The group

About Love,” and an excellent
rendition of ‘Invader,’ featur-

right into ‘Pretty Woman,” off

the set with a hot version of the
old Kinks tune “You Really Got

Michael Anthony on bass, and
Alex Van Halen on drums pro-
vided a strong, though unspec-
tacular, rhythm section. Their
solos, though nothing to rave
about, were far better than in
the past.

The visual, and musical,
focus of the show was David Lee
Roth and Eddie Van Halen,
Guitar Player Magazine’s
Guitarist of the Year. Roth
played upon his sex-symbol
aura by coming out all but bare-
assed, and Van Halen simply
devastated the audience with
his incredible skills on the
guitar.

Roth’s vocals throughout the

showed once again how good he

is at working an audience up.

Edward Van Halen, un-
doubtedly among _rock’s
greatest guitarists, was at his
best. His leads and solos were
clean and fast, and his wide
range of ability left you wonder-
ing what would come next. It’s
really a shame Edward Van
Halen hasn’t left this outfit and
joined some of his musical
equals. He truly puts the rest of
the bandtoshame. |

Although the two hour show
dragged in spots, and did have
its flaws, it was a very good con-

put on a good show, and still

seldom find together nowadays.

Junior Don White is tangled up by a Spider defender in W&L’s
match-up with Richmond. The Generals were upset by a single goal

in last Sunday’s action.

Richmond dunks W&L, nabs title

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor
The Washington and Lee
water polo team received a
rude awakening last Sunday
afternoon as the favored
Generals were upset 12-11 by
archrival Richmond in the
championship game of the
Virginia State Championships.
It was a combination of fac-
tors that led to the defeat. The
Generals’ mental attitude, as
the players reflected, wasn’t up
to par. This lapse, in turn, led to
key mental errors that W&L

could not rectify. Along with

Eagles upend Generals

Phi Staff Writer

Bridgewater College upset
the Washington and Lee football
team 28-13 Saturday at Bridge-
water to drop W&L’s Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference mark
to 3-2.

The loss, the third in a row for
the Generals, dropped their
overall record below .500 for the
first time this year at 3-4. The
defeat also virtually eliminates
the Generals from the ODAC ti-
tle race.

“It gets tougher as you lose.
Everybody starts pressing and
maybe pointing the finger.
What we need right now is a
nice win. We’re not quitters,”’
W&L Coach Gary Fallon stated.

In Saturday’s game, Bridge-
water opened up a 14-0 lead

RESPONSIBILITY IN THE NAVY

midway through the second
quarter. Al Price scored from
one yard out at 6:12 of the first
quarter and Dudley Delbridge
scored at 8:18 of the second
quarter on a 2-yard run. Both
Bridgewater touchdown drives
covered less than 50 yards.
W&L got on the scoreboard
with 1:45 left in the half to pull
to 14-3. Senior Bill Devine split
the uprights with a 36-yard
field goal to cap a drive that
began at the W&L 31-yard line.
“TI don’t think we played a
very intense game offensively
and defensively in the first
half,” observed Fallon. ‘You
can’t expect to go into a
dogfight for any number of
rounds and not expect to play
well all the time,”’ he noted.
Things got even tougher for

 
   
   

W&L in the second half. W&L
failed to cover Bridgewater’s
opening kickoff, and the Eagles
pounced on the ball at the W&L
36 yard line, Moments later,
Don Tapley scored on a 1-yard
sneak to give Bridgewater a
21-3 lead.

W&L bounced back witha 72-
yard scoring drive. Freshman
Frank Surface bullied nine
yards for the touchdown at 4:56
of the third quarter to pull the
Generals to 21-10.

For Surface, who usually
enters the game in short yard-
age situations, it was his second
touchdown in as many weeks.
“We’re really pleased with
what we’ve seen of him so far,”
said Fallon.

Bill Devine’s 26-yard field
goal at 9:10 of the fourth
quarter further narrowed the
Bridgewater lead and brought
the score to 21-13. The score was
set up by a good defensive effort
and a short Bridgewater punt.

W&L could get no closer
though, and with the Generals
defense gambling to try to
create a turnover, Dudley
Delbridge sprinted 23 yards for
the final Bridgewater touch-
down with 23 seconds left in the
game.

(continued on page 11)

this were some bad breaks at
the wrong times and overall
consistent play from the
Spiders of Richmond.

There was an overiding cause
that Coach Page Remillard saw
as instrumental. The Generals
didn’t have the hunger that
Richmond did. ‘“‘We’ve been
listening to too many people tell
us how good we are,’’ stated the
Generals’ mentor. It seemed
that this was the first time the
Generals had beaten them-
selves all season. ‘“‘We’ve got to
use this as a learning ex-
perience,’ explained Remil-
lard, “‘and I think we will.”’

Both teams breezed to their
eventual match-ups as pre-
dicted, and the contest began
with Richmond jumping out in
front 2-0, taking early advan-
tage of some obvious General
tenseness. The Generals came
back to knot it at 5-5 by
halftime, led by senior Erik
Peterson, who, as Remillard
put it, ‘‘had his best game ever
as a W&L polo player.”’

Peterson scored five goals in
the game.

Things fell apart in the third
stanza, as a missed penalty
shot and an open net goal left
the Generals stunned as they
began the fourth period down
8-5. Defensive pressure by W&L
got them back in the contest

again, and at the 3:50 mark they
cut the Spiders’ lead to one goal
at 10-9. It was not enough,
though, and Richmond held on
to win.

Coach Remillard promises a
different scenario for this
weekend at Richmond for the
Southern League Champion-
ships. ‘“We will bring the
Southern League championship
home to W&L.’’ asserted
Remillard, though he did note
that the Generals would earn
the victory during this week in
practice as much as they would
on Sunday afternoon. W&L will
take an unblemished 8-0 league
record into the tournament,
which includes an 8-5 victory
over Richmond two weekends
ago.

SIDELIGHT: Prior to the
Richmond contest, the Generals
and Coach Remillard presented
W&L professor Samuel J.
Kozak with a plaque dedicating
their victory over Slippery
Rock at the Bucknell Invita-
tional on Oct. 16 to him. Dr.
Kozak, who is always a special
fan at the Generals’ games,
underwent bypass surgery
earlier this year. The plaque
was signed by all the players
and Coach Remillard and was
inscribed, “From a special vic-
tory of ours to a special victory
of yours.’

Harriers host ODACs

Washington and Lee will play
host to six teams this Saturday
for the seventh annual Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Championships, and the har-
riers will definitely have their
work cut out for them.

W&L will face Bridgewater,
Lynchburg, Catholic,
Hampden-Sydney, Eastern
Mennonite and defending cham-
pion Roanoke in the 8000-meter
race. The meet is scheduled to
begin at 11 0’clock.

Each team in the ODAC meet
can enter up to twelve runners,
although only the top seven
finishers will count towards the

team’s score. The top seven in-
dividual finishers are awarded
All-Conference honors; Coach
Miller picks Lynchburg’s Tim
Doran and Grattan Garbee,
Catholic’s Dan Murphy,
Roanoke’s Any Chocklett and
Tony Wirt, Bridgewater’s Terry
Lenny, and W&L’s Angus
McBryde and Frank Pittman as
contenders for this honor. Last
year’s Championship meet at
Bridgewater found Chocklett
placing second, Wirt third, Len-
ny sixth, and McBryde seventh.

Last year W&L placed fourth
as McBryde became the first
General to receive All-
Conference honors. Miller is

Sophomore quarterback John
Thompson had a good day pass-
ing, completing 13 of 21 passes
for 145 yards. His only intercep-
tion came with 17 seconds left
and the game out of reach.

Several Generals had a good
day receiving. Seniors Ken
Robinson, Jerry Thompson and
Chris Cavalline all had three
receptions and senior Steve
Corbeille had a 43-yard catch.

This Saturday the Generals
play their last home game of the
season against Catholic Univer-
sity. Catholic is a non-league op-
ponent this year, but next year
they will be a member of the
ODAC.

The Cardinals bring a 5-2
record into the game, including
a 19-18 win over Georgetown,
W&L’s opponent next week.
They have also beaten ODAC
member Emory & Henry 21-14.

“Catholic is bigger than
Bridgewater. They’re quicker
than Bridgewater, and they
really swarm to the ball,”
warned Fallon.

“Offensively they throw the
ball well. They’ve got a
freshman quarterback who has
thrown for over 1,000 yards
already,”’ Fallon pointed out.

The question of who will start
at quarterback for W&L Satur-
day remains unresolved. Fallon
reports that John Thompson
has a minor injury and Al
Paradise is now completely
healthy. ‘‘We’ll see who had the
better practice time during the
week,’’ Fallon said.

only goal came with 26 seconds

Seniors Mark Carduner and

Players-of-the-game for

Carduner scored two goals

Senior Brad Poorman, junior

Bill Holmes each added a goal

Poorman’s tally upped his

‘We followed our game plan
to a ‘T’ against Catholic. When
Catholic pushed their de-
fensemen up, our forwards slip-
ped in behind and were in good
position all day. We had ex-
cellent passing, excellent
shooting and _ excellent
defense,” said Piranian.

“The guys enjoyed them-
selves in those games (VMI and
Catholic). It showed on the
scoreboard, it showed in prac-
tice, it showed just about
everywhere. They’ve been put-
ting it all together recently.”’
