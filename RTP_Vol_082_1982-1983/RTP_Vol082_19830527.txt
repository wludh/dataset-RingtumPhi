Law school

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity awarded juris doctor
degrees to 123 law students dur-
ing commencement exercises
for the W&L School of Law Sun-
day (May 22).

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson was the
principal speaker for the
ceremony, which was held in
the Warner Center.

In his remarks Wilson refer-
red to several common criti-
cisms aimed at the legal profes-
sion as well as concerns within
the profession.

‘| think as a people we are
starting to wonder whether we
have created too many statutes,
whether we haven’t contrived
too many regulations to govern
our corporate and our social
lives, whether the jurisdiction
of the court hasn’t reached out
too far to take in matters that
could perhaps more properly
settled by other bodies,” said
Wilson.

Within the profession, added
Wilson, there are concerns
‘“‘about whether equity under
the law is available to all our
citizens...(concerns) that the
criminal justice system con-
tinues to be clogged and creak-
ing and groaning with its pro-
cesses. There is the double and
paradoxical criticism that there
is not enough emphasis being
given to reconciliation...and at
the same time that there is too
much emphasis on plea-

bargaining.”

Wilson asked the law
graduates ‘‘not to leave these
criticisms to the amateurs.
Your generation must take
them up afresh, deal seriously
with those warranting serious
study, make it the real attention
of the profession.”

There is, Wilson added,
‘‘more at stake than the proper
ordering of the larger society.
Also at stake is the self-
governing character of the pro-
fession itself, and that must be
safeguarded.”’

Wilson also paid tribute to law
school Dean Roy L. Steinheimer
Jr., who retires June 30 from
the position he has held since

Read seeks

By WIN SISSON
Phi Staff Writer

Rockbridge County Com-
monwealth Attorney Beverly C.
‘John’ Read told the Phi
Wednesday that the current
drug problem exposed by a rash
of recent arrests is indicative of
a disease which has infected not
only our community here at
W&L, but our entire society as
well.

Steinheimer’s si

“Roy Steinheimer will have
forever the pleasure and the
deep satisfaction of knowing
that he virtually remade one of
America’s...significant institu-
tions,’”’ Wilson said, then refer-
red to a number of the many
changes accomplished during
Steinheimer’s deanship: the
size of the school increased by
2-1/2 times, women were admit-
ted as candidates for degrees,
90 percent of the current faculty
was recruited by Steinheimer, a
new law school building (Lewis
Hall) was constructed, and the
Frances Lewis Law Center was
established.

“For you and the 14 other
classes whose diplomas carry
his (Steinheimer’s) signature,
he will always be the dean,”
Wilson added.

Steinheimer told the law
students to remember that ‘‘a
lawyer must not be only
courageous but must be com-
passionate.”

Steinheimer further told the
members of the law class to
“conduct your affairs with a
sense of decency and civility
which respects the dignity of all
persons, friend or foe, who may
be touched by your actions.
Always faithfully discharge
your professional obligations to

the very best of your abilities...
Most importantly, always
remember that the only real
asset that a lawyer has is his
reputation for honesty and in-
tegrity. Guard and nurture this
precious asset throughout your
professional life.”

The John W. Davis Prize for
Law, given to the graduate who
maintained the best record for
general excellence throughout
his law school career, was
presented to Michael Louis
Krancer of Villanova, Pa.

Other awards announced at
commencement included the
United States Law Week Award
for the most satisfactory
scholastic progress to David
Stan Barnhill of Roanoke; the
Virginia Trial Lawyers
Association Award to Joseph
David Padgett of Virginia
Beach; the Leonard J. Schmelz
Award to Deborah Hutchins
Combs of princeton, W.Va.; the
Roy L. Steinheimer Jr. Com-
mercial Law Award to Coyne
Drew Demaray of Birming-
ham, Ala.; the University Ser-
vice Award to David Keith
Freidfeld of Merrick, Long
Island, N.Y.: and the Ring-tum
Phi Award to Howard Morgan
Griffith of Salem.

‘raw punishment’

When asked if the students
currently charged with drug-
related offenses might avoid in-
carceration and receive a lesser
form of discipline, probation
perhaps, Read said ‘‘I hope not.
Anyone who possesses drugs
with the intent to distribute
should go behind bars
regardless of whether he be a
W&L mink, a VMI cadet, a
Rockbridge County redneck, or
a white-collar city worker.”’ He

said he does not wish to ‘‘make
an example’ of anyone, but
reasoned that convictions would
serve as “‘raw punishment’’ to
the offenders, and would ‘‘serve
as a deterrent to others.”

The Commonwealth Attorney
lamented the lack of knowledge
among W&L students concern-
ing the severity of legal
penalties for possession of illicit
drugs.

Swansong Thursday

Undergraduate commence-
ment activities at Washington
and Lee University will begin
Wednesday (June 1) with the
baccalaureate service in Evans
Hall at 11 a.m.

The speaker for the bac-
calaureate will be the Rev.
George M. Docherty, currently
Howerton Scholar-in-Residence
at Washington and Lee. Docher-
ty was for 26 years the minister
of the New York Avenue
Presbyterian Church in Wash-
ington, D.C.

Following the baccalaureate
service, the W&L Alumni
Association will sponsor its an-
nual luncheon in honor of the
graduating seniors.

President and Mrs. John D.
Wilson will be the hosts for a
reception for the seniors and
their families and guests on
Wednesday evening. That will
be followed by a faculty recep-
tion and dance in Evans Hall.

On Thursday (June 2), the
commencement day activities

will begin at 9 a.m. when the
university’s Army ROTC unit
holds its commissioning
ceremony in Lee Chapel.
Retired Maj. Gen. George S.
Patton, son of the famous World
War II commander, will be the
commissioning speaker. Nine-
teen W&L cadets will be com-
missioned in the ceremony.

Diplomas will be awarded
Thursday to approximately 280
students in W&L’s College (the
university’s arts and sciences
division) and the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics
during exercises on the Front
Lawn beginning at 11 a.m. The
principal speaker will be W&L
President Wilson, who will be
making his first commence-
ment address as president of
the university. By tradition,
Bennett L. Ross of Huntington,
W.Va., Washington and Lee’s
student body president, will
deliver remarks on behalf of the
graduating seniors.

Burglars busted

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Phi Staff Writer

Two Lexington youths, aged
13 and 14, have been arrested by
Lexington Police and charged
with grand larceny and
burglary stemming from a
number of burglaries in
Washington and Lee University
dorms and libraries.

The youths were arrested
Saturday night outside Lloyd’s,
shortly after being seen leaving
a floor of the Graham-Lees dor-
mitory where thefts had oc-
cured. Acting on a hunch, Dorm
Counselors David Judge and

James Clark and three other
students went to Lloyd’s, where
they confronted the youths and
forced them to turn over about
$100 in cash.

The youths, who Judge said
seemed scared, asked to be let
go, but the students decided it
would be better to call the
police. After police arrived the
youths were forced to empty
their pockets, which Judge says
contained calculators, cassette
tapes, knives and rings, pre-
sumably taken from dorm
rooms.

O’Connor cleared

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Phi Staff Writer

Legal proceedings against Kevin O’Connor, a Washington and
Lee sophomore who had been charged with possession of cocaine,
have been dropped for the time being. At a preliminary hearing
Tuesday, Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John’” Read

entered a motion of Nolle Prosequi.

This usually means the charges have been dropped, although
Read would not rule out the possibility of reintroducing the case.
Read refused to comment because the case is technically still pen-

ding.

O’Connor’s attorney, Eric Lee Sisler, a former Commonwealth’s
Attorney who has prosecuted drug-related cases, said he did not ex-

pect the case to come up again.

O’Connor had been charged after police investigating a burglary
at the Delta Tau Delta fraternity discovered items bearing cocaine
residue in his room. O’Connor said the items were not his, and that

a polygraph test supported him.

In other court related developments, hearings for Charles
Phillips and Marc Ham, both charged with possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute, were postponed.

Phillips, who waived his right to a preliminary hearing, had a
trial set for May 19. A new trial date will be set July 6.

Ham was scheduled to have a preliminary hearing on May 24, but
it was postponed by the prosecutor, pending the arrival of labratory

reports.

Pyling it on

By M. SHAW PYLE

Despite the fact that the
weather back home (and over
in Louisiana and Mississippi)
has been godawful, it may safe-
ly be said that the hounds of
Spring have treed their
‘possum. We are all of us
preparing to bolt more or less
homewards any minute now.
Only the Powers That Be will
remain. The majority of us, I
imagine, would like the place to
be standing when September
falls heavily upon us. So, to
those Powers, the following
reminders.

Imprimus, Tories and Whigs
(as opposed to the so-called
‘liberals’ of today) are alike
agreed that there is a profound
difference between tradition
and legislation. A law may be
pushed, pulled, stretched out of
shape, and stood on its head;
and then restored by the same
House that fooled around with it
to begin with. A tradition, once
broken, is forever lost. Now, we -
‘Whigs differ from the Tories in
assuming that there may exist a
moral obligation to change

radically at the last resort; but
that certainly doesn’t happen
often, and is not even con-
ceivable in the case of the pro-
posed changes ’round here, be it
coeducation or putting in a new
Bauhaus auditorium.

Secundus, the Powers would
do well to recall that there is a
difference between growth and
change. Growth is an organic
development which adds on to
existing precedent. Mere
change breaks with tradition
and imposes something upon
the corpus in its place, often in
very stupid fashions.

Tertius, any attempt to mere-
ly excise the past cuts the

‘ground from beneath the

reformer. Renouncing the past
renounces — indeed, denies
—the present problem, and
makes the proffered nostrums
valueless.

Ergo, let caution be the
watchword, good sirs, this sum-
mer and henceforward. Let us
not go incautious into the
future.

So much for this year, folks.

_ Until the next, all the best.

Letters

To the Editor:

On behalf of the needy in

Rockbridge county and across
the world, we, the W&L Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship,
would like to thank everyone
who supported the world hunger
project. Particular thanks goes
to Mr. Darrell and the employ-
ees of Evans Dining Hall who
worked with us in arranging a
world hunger night on Tuesday,
May 17. Through the kindness of
many students in donating their
meals, we received $315.15 from
Evans Dining Hall. Our
gratitude also goes out to the
fraternities, which, as a whole
were very cooperative and
generous. The money, which
may total as much as $400, will
be divided between RARA
(Rockbridge Area _ Relief
Association) and World Vision.
Again, thanks for your support,
and we look forward to another
successful world hunger project
next year.

Brickbats from Bouquet

To the Editor;

Last week’s~- Excelsior
contained a reply by Markham
Pyle to my article ‘Compassion
and the Republican Party,”
which appeared in the Winter
Excelsior. Mr. Pyle. disputes
my contention that the poor
were hurt by the 1981 Reagan
tax cut. It is quite true that
every taxpayer received some
sort of tax relief. I am not stupid
enough to claim that only the
rich received a tax cut in 1981.
What I am claiming is that
those tax cuts, while putting an
extra can of Campbell’s soup on
the table for the average 4-
member, poverty-level family,
ended up hurting poor people on
the overall.

The Reagan tax cut was part
of an overall ‘‘Economic
Recovery Act,’’ which couples
the tax cuts with domestic
spending cuts and defense in-
creases. The domestic spending
cuts were an integral part of the
tax cut package — one could not

go without the other. Reagan
had to try to balance the budget
somewhere — and it ended up
being on the backs of those who
could least afford it. That’s
right — the working poor and
the middle class of this country.
Let’s talk about how the spend-
ing cuts, which could not be
separated from the tax cuts,
hurt the poor. The Legal Ser-
vices Corporation, providing
legal aid for the poor, was gut-
ted and staffed with lawyers
who drained the remaining
funds with fees two and three
times as high as those charged
in the past. Student aid has been
decreased, with the resultant
decrease in opportunity. The
list goes on and on.

Pyle seems to have missed
my point: I decried the un-
fairness of those tax cuts — both
in the repercussions and in the
way they were skewed.

The top 5 percent in income
received 33 percent of the tax

break. Mr. Pyle claims this
break must, by the necessity of
his own inexorable logic, accrue
to the poor by “‘trickling down
from on high.” If the trickle
down farce is ‘“‘reasonable’’ as
Mr. Pyle suggests it is, then
why hasn’t it worked up to this
point, in the Reagan version?
To this Reaganauts will answer,
‘Well, now we're in a
recovery.’”’ We are in a
recovery; a recovery from the
worst recession. in post-war
history. It is a Paul Volcker
recovery made necessary by
$200 billion Reagan deficits and
the failure of the Reagan pro-
gram. (Yes, Reagan, the same
man who hysterically calls the
Democrats big spenders.)
Volcker’s recovery came from
loosening the reins of the money
supply when he looked a U.S.
depression in the face in July
1982. (Remember Reagan’s
magic formula of Fall 1981: $1
trillion in  tax-cut-revenue
drains over 5 years plus huge in-
creases in defense spending
plus a few cuts in child nutrition
programs equals economic
bliss and Pax Americana
abroad.) The same economics
that Vice President Bush once
called ‘‘voodoo economics” had
laid the prospect of a depression
on Volcker’s desk.

What leadership has Reagan
shown since 1981? The answer
is: none. He has done nothing
but blame Congress and the
past administration for the pro-
blems his 1981 package created.

Many of those who voted for
the 1981 package, including
such Republican moderates as
Baker, Dole, and Domenici,
have tried to redress an error
by showing the leadership that
Regan will not show. They have
said that revenues must be rais-
ed. Two-hundred billion dollar
budget deficits cannot simply
be wished or blamed away. This
country is without leadership.
Our president has done nothing
since 1981 — where is the
leadership in action? Where is
the leadership in a President
who stands up at a Brazilian
state dinner and toasts his
“Bolivian” hosts; who a couple
of weeks ago at a conference
with news editors was so rambl-
ing and incoherent that the
white house press corps was
given to guffawing? Where is
the leadership in a man, who
two and one half years after
taking office as President, still
spouts the same conservative
slogans he used for decades on
the ‘‘rubber-chicken’”’ circuit.

Reagan, as all modern
presidents, must protect the
constitutional rights of blacks
— it’s his constitutional duty.
However, overall civil rights
policy has been as unfair as the
economic policy that accom-
panied his tax cuts. The Reagan
administration has tightened its
interpretations of discrimina-
tion in higher education, pro-

posed tax credits for segregated
universities, advocated a return
to the false ‘“‘separate but
equal” doctrine in coming out
against busing, called affir-
mative action a “racial spoils
system.”’ To Reagan, 20 years
of progress in eliminating
racism has redressed 200 years
of brutal oppression of fellow
human beings. All citizens now
share equal opportunity, says
Reagan. If this is so, why is
black teenage unemployment at
45 percent? If Reagan has
helped the cause of blacks, why
will over 80 percent of blacks
vote against him if he runs in
1984? And what about economic
rights? Aren’t these commen-
surate with opportunity? I defy
Mr. Pyle to call Reagan a fair
man.

Reagan is, contrary to what
Mr. Pyle says, as hysterical in
foreign affairs as he is unfair in
domestic affairs. If Mr. Pyle
even talked to one European he
might find out how hysterical
Reagan’s bellicosity has been.
Pyle is dead wrong when he
claims that Reagan is not
responsible for the European
peace demonstrations. These
demonstrations were caused by
loose talk about ‘“‘limited
nuclear war” and ‘“‘evil Soviet
empires,’”’ and an overriding
concentration on military mat-
ters in East/West relations. Mr.
George Kennan, one of the fore-
most scholars on the Soviets,
recently called it ‘irresponsi-
ble” for the President to think
of nothing but “balance of
power” in relations with our
adversary.

Those who call for a more
balanced approach, such as
Democrats and the Catholic
bishops, are what Mr. Pyle and
Lenin would call “‘useful fools.’’
The bishops are not naive fools,
unaware of the real world. They
are just as acute in their obser-
vations of the world as Mr. Pyle
claims he is. Or would Mr. Pyle
suggest his point of view was
less foolish than men who have
risen through the church hierar-
chy, after years of dealing with
human problems? The bishops,
and the Democrats, are not cry-
ing out for surrender to godless
communism. They are crying
for a moral consideration of

nuclear arms. The words of the _

bishops carry moral impact.
The words of the democrats,
and all of those who have
discovered they were sold a bill
of goods by the Reagan ad-
ministration and the Republi-
can National Committee, the
words of the working and mid-
die class of this country, who
are much worse off under
Reagan than ever before, will
carry political impact in 1984.
Democrats will carry the ban-
ner of equality in domestic
policy and stability in foreign
policy.

residential work and study at
the Stonewall Jackson House in
Lexington.. The two Moody
Fellows will begin work at the
Jackson House in mid-June.

Comstock is a graduate of
Ohio State University. She is a
native of Logan, Ohio, and has
lived for two years in Char-
lottesville while: working at
Monticello. She is studying
American history in the gradu-
ate program at Montana State
and plans a career in museum
administration and historic site
interpretation.

Brundage is a graduate of the
University of Chicago and has
just completed his first year of

‘“They’ve been seen around
the frats and libraries,’’ in addi-
tion to the dorms, said Judge,
adding, “I think these guys
could be tied to a lot of thefts.’’

Since the two teens were ap-
prehended, Judge said many
students have come forward to
say things had been taken from
their room. Lately, however,
“these things are coming out
every day,’’ Judge says.

University proctor Charles
‘‘Murph”’ Murray, who credits
the students with apprehending

the alleged thieves, says a Class
Pass seized with the two teens
might tie them to a break in at
Ko Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater-
nity.

The two preyed on the unlock-
ed doors in university dorms,
entering rooms and taking
small things that could be easily
concealed, concentrating on
cash. ‘“‘They’d empty your
wallet out and throw it on the
floor,” said Judge.

“I’ve never locked my door in
my three years here,” said
Judge, who had money taken
from his room, “I was shock-
ed.”

Time out ...

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

..When one thinks of men’s
professional tennis, an image
that — most recently — is
unavoidable in such a con-
sideration is that of a John
McEnroe bitching or a Jimmy
Connors showing us that he
—professional that he is — can
make obscene gestures that
most 15-year-olds understand.
What one takes away from this
is that these gentlemen surely
can’t be enjoying their work, so
why make us pay to watch peo-
ple complain about their jobs?
There is hope for us, the shafted
spectators, in the person of Jim-
my Arias. The 18-year-old born
and bred in the oft criticized
and little understood American
hotbed, junior tennis. No, Jim-
my’s not a saint, but stacked
against the other bad boys he’s
certainly ready for canoniza-
tion. An illustration of the hope
on the horizon was Arias’ per-
formance at the Italian Open

 

last weekend. The young man

from New York not only won the
tournament, but also his style of
play was one that seems to be
missing too often in today’s
players, especially the
Americans. His intensity and
tenacity are complemented by
an on-court demeanor that em-
barrasses no one. He questions
calls but does not berate of-
ficials. What’s more, he makes
the match enjoyable, not simply
because his skills are so finely
tuned, but because it is readily
apparent that he enjoys his
work. Tennis and sports in
general need more stars like
Jimmy Arias. Who knows?
Maybe good sportsmanship will
become cool again....

...It’s a shame that the sports
awards ceremonies seem to go
unnoticed by those outside the
W&L athletic community. Too
often it seems our vision is
clouded by the games and the
scores and we aren’t able to see
what athletics are supposed to
be. We lose sight of the first part
of the hyphenation ‘‘student-
athlete.” The athletes, indeed,

the entire athletic program at
W&L deserves more than praise
for consistently representing
the best in themselves and, in
turn, the best in W&L....

...Thank you Jimmy Connors
for once again proving how vile
you actually are. Connors, who
refused to play on the Davis Cup
team against Argentina be-
cause he had vowed to never
again play on clay, is seeded
first at the French Open. The
surfaces at the French Open:
Clay...

..The Jersey Prince’s final
words for W&L 1982-83 are as
follows:

“Over the summer, don’t
forget my baseball picks:
Milwaukee, Chicago; (AL), and
L.A., Montreal; (NL). If he
runs, Marfa may be tough in the
Belmont. Ivan Lendl, Martina
Navratilova will win Womble-
don. One last prediction: The

Prince will have a Deep, Dark.

Tan in about three days. Good

summer...
seit I hope this space has made

you think at least enough to
make you question my sanity.
Enjoy your vacation. I look for-
ward to chatting again.....

 

 

$150,000 on-campus pavilion

By WIN SISSON
Phi Staff Writer

During the Executive Com-
mittee meeting Monday night, a
study advocating the construc-
tion of an on-campus pavilion
was presented by the members
of the Recreation Center Com-
mittee. The RCC concluded in
their report that there is a
definite need for such a struc-
ture and made tentative
estimates of the cost and size of
the project. The RCC was form-
ed during the winter and in-
cludes EC members Darby

Brower, Dave Johnston and
Mike Singer.

The RCC cited three reasons
why they believe there is a need
for an on-campus recreation
center. First, it would supple-
ment activities usually held in
other university buildings. Se-
cond, with the new ABC laws it
would provide a reliable source
for university sponsored social
events. Third, it would reduce
the. incidence of drunk driving.

Among those whom the RCC
consulted was head of Buildings
and Grounds, Mr. Scott Beebe.

In an interview with the Phi,
Beebe said ‘‘such a place would

serve to reduce the wear and °

tear on other university
buildings.” Beebe also noted
that student involvement would
reduce B&G crew time as less
time would need be spent
preparing university buildings
for school functions.

Another member of the W&L
community who is supportive of
the recreation center proposal
is Director of University Dining
and Food Service Jerry Darrell.
“People are always asking me

English plays well at
NCAA Championships

Competing in a field of 120,
Washington and Lee senior
Frank English tied for 82nd

place in the NCAA Division III
golf Championships held May
17-20 in Wooster, Ohio.

English, a _ resident of
Philadelphia, carded rounds of
85, 79, 79 and 81 for a 324 total at
the par-72 Wooster Country

Club, which W&L coach Buck
Leslie described as ‘‘a tough
course with small, sloping
greens that made putting, very
difficult.”

“Frank played much better
than he scored,’’ added the
eight-year mentor. ‘‘He ran into

bad luck on two holes the first
day, then put together two con-
sistent rounds including one the

(to use the dining hall)...I try to
be as liberal as possible.”
However, maintenance costs as
well as the growing size of func-
tions such as the Superdance
have forced Darrell to for-
mulate a new policy concerning
use of the hall. “Evans is no
longer available for non-dining
functions with the exception of
on-going, recurring things held
in the past.” said Darrell. He
noted one obvious advantage of
an on-campus pavilion — it
would reduce drunk driving.
Coming to and from Zollman’s
“at least three people have been
killed since I’ve been here”
Darrell added.

Tentative estimates of the
proposal project a structure
nearly five times the size in
square footage of Evans and at
an estimated cost of $150,000.
Beebe stressed that estimates
made at this time are mere

“ballpark figures.”

The RCC suggested that fun-
ding come from student taxes.
The report states: A very rough
estimate of $150,000 would allow
for a student tax increase of $12
per student for the next 25
years. Obviously, a loan of
$150,000 from the school or a
commercial bank would be
necessary, and an interest rate
of 8.8 percent has been the cur-
rent rate for fraternities. Costs
that would be incurred through
the operation of the facility
would be picked up through the
student tax and through rental
charges to those deciding to use
the facility. The university
treasurer has suggested that a
university loan could be given
to the student body, to be paid
through a 25-year period by an
increase in the student tax.

Similar considerations have
been made at nearby Sweet

third day when rain sent most
scores into the 80’s.”’

English, one of 25 golfers to
receive ‘‘at-large’’ berths in the
Championships, also played in a
48-man East-West All-Star
event held May 16 at the Club.
He and his partner won their

match to help the East post a 7-5
win in the best-ball competition.

English was the third W&L

golfer to play as an individual in
the Championships. Jerry
Maatman of Wilmett, Ill. finish-
ed third in the 1979 event, also
held at Wooster, and Gerry
Barousse of New Orleans plac-

ed 48th in 1980. The Generals
have twice sent an entire team:
first in 1977, when they placed
seventh; and again in 1979 when
they finished 11th.

Briar the Board of Overseers.
determined April 29 that though
the need for such a building ex-
ists, money which would fund
such a project is more needed in
other areas. Hollins scratched
their pavilion plan, opting in-
stead to revamp the Moody
Center. However, it has not
been determined whether the
million-dollar endowment made
recently to the school will affect
these plans.

As recently as 1980, a pro-
posal advocating an on-campus
pavilion was made at W&L. Ac-
cording to Associate Dean of
Students Mike Cappeto, the 1980
proposal died as a result of bad
publicity in the Ring-tum Phi.
Initially, said Cappeto, the
faculty and administration
favored the proposal, but
numerous errors and mis-
representations in the Phi ‘‘kill-
edit.”

The RCC prefers to see a
multi-purpose structure built. It
would be more functional, bet-
ter serve departmental needs
and have a greater use to
students and faculty.

However a_ multi-purpose
facility would be much more
costly and take much longer to
build.

When all the pros and cons
are weighed it seems the
pavilion could answer many
needs. Perhaps most important
of these was one one brought out
by -President Wilson in his
‘First Impressions’ speech.

“I worry about the non-
affiliated students...35 percent
of us are not members of frater-
nities and I’m not sure what
kind of social or extra-
curricular life the university

_helps to provide for students

who have decided not to go that
way.”
