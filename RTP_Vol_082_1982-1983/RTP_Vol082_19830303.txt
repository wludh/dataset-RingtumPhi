elected to
Phi Beta
Kappa

Twenty-eight undergraduate
students at Washington and Lee
University and one 1982 W&L
graduate have been elected to
membership in the university’s
Gamma of Virginia Chapter of
Phi Beta Kappa.

In addition, Leonard E. Jar-
rard, professor of psychology at
W&L, has been elected to
membership in Phi Beta Kappa
as an honorary election.

The Gamma of Virginia
Chapter was installed at
Washington and Lee in 1911 and
annually elects a_ limited
number of students whose
academic record and character
are superior.

The new members were in-
ducted at the Phi Beta Kap-
pa/Cincinnati Society Convoca-
tion on Tuesday (March 1) in
Lee Chapel. The annual Phi
Beta Kappa address was
delivered by Van Doorn Ooms,
chief economist for the U‘S.
House of Representatives
Budget Committee.

Jarrard received the A.B.
degree in psychology from
Baylor University and earned
both the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
in psychology from Carnegie-
Mellon University.

He has taught at Washington
and Lee sifice 1959 with the ex-
ception of five years from 1966
to 1970 when he was a professor
and later chairman of the
graduate program in
psychology at Carnegie-Mellon.

For the past 17 years Jarrard
has been conducting research
supported. by the National
Science Foundation into a seg-
ment of the brain known as the
hippocampus. He is the author
of numerous articles and has
won several awards for his
work, including a 1981 award
for ‘‘outstanding contribution to
psychology as a science’ from
the Virginia Psychological
Association.

The students elected to
membership in Phi Beta Kappa
this year were:

Seniors: William E. Alison Jr.
of Huntsville, Ala.; Peter A.
Baumgaertner of Syosset,
N.Y.; James E. Burt IV of
Shreveport, Va.; Steven D. Cor-
beille of Haymarket, Va.; Joel

EC meeting

 

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

~

Dave Judge was elected vice-
president of the Executive Com-
mittee and Len Howard was
chosen as secretary in Mon-
day’s elections.

Current EC secretary Mike
Singer and junior class presi-
dent Bob Jenevein won posi-
tions in today’s runoff for EC
president.

Jenevein garnered 282 votes
and Singer 267 of the 742 cast for
the EC’s top spot, Markham
Pyle received 147 votes and Gov
Slahor won 44.

The vice-presidential race
centered around the EC’s
refusal to accept the late peti-
tions of Scott Tilley and Emory
Edwards. Therefore, the two
were forced to run as write-in
candidates. Tilly received 80
votes and Edwards 51, but
Judge easily ousted them with
484 votes.

Tilley submitted his petition

one day late, and EC President
Bennett Ross attempted a
phone vote of committee
members, to accept the petition
and put Tilley’s name on the
ballot. He explained, however,
“Since we did not have a
quorum present to do business,
several members of the com-
mittee wanted to discuss it and
challenge it. I had no choice but
to call a meeting.”

That special meeting was
held Thursday evening. In the
meantime, Edwards had also
submitted his petition. Only

eight of the 12 EC members
were present, and sophomore
Representative Darby
Browers’ motion to accept the
petitions was defeated 4-3.

Ted McQuiston, Morgan Grif-
fith and Pete Baumgaertner
supported the motion while
John Vlahoplus, Ross, Steve
Connett and Brower voted
againstit.

Singer abstained from voting.

Junior Representative Scott
Mason said at the regular Mon-
day meeting that he had not
been notified of the special
meeting. Mason said later that
he would have voted to accept
the petitions.

Ross’ reasoning generally
reflected that of those who join-
ed him in voting against accep-
ting the petitions. ‘‘The idea of
the deadline is to demonstrate
some kind of responsibility and
committment to seeking the of-

fice,’ he said. “Why have
deadlines if they ‘won’t be
upheld?”

Len Howard faced no

declared opposition for the
secretary’s post and won handi-
ly with 565 votes of the 599 cast.
The Monday meeting was not
much more than an assortment
of announcements and a report
from the Student Financial
Relations Committee, which
has picked up 113 checks so far
this year. The committee show-
ed a balance of $800, not in-
cluding an extra $200 that Ran-
dall Jacoby gave to an obvious-
ly pleased Griffith. EC funds
have been particulary tight this

year. ;

Funds for the Political
Review were frozen when that
group failed to present a budget
report. Only first-year law
Representative John Sancilian
voted against the motion.

Brower reported on the Honor
Conference at William and
Mary attended by several EC
members last weekend. Brower
said, ‘‘Our system really seem-
ed to rank above everybody
else’s.”’

Ross suggested that next
year’s committee look into the
feasibility of hosting the Honor
Conference.

Brower recommended that
the EC investigate the possibili-
ty of joining forces with VMI to
build a recreation area to take
the place of Zollman’s
Pavillion. ‘It’s a good way to
get the two schools together,”
he said. VMI, however, as an
historical landmark, is not
allowed to build on its property.

Senior representative
Baumgaertner suggested that
the EC worry about uniting the
undergraduate and the law
campuses before trying to hook
up with VMI.

The EC commended the Moot
Court team on its recent victory
at William and Mary over such
larger schools as Virginia and
Wake Forest. The fencing team
also received recognition for its
first victory over U.Va. since
1941,

McCarthy
to debate

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

John Ehrlichman and Eugene
McCarthy, once major figures
on the American political scene,
will appear on campus Thurs-
day, March 17. in a debate spon-

| sored by Contact.

Ehrlichman, a key aide to
former President Nixon, and
McCarthy, a Democratic
senator from Minnesota for 12
years ending in 1971, will speak
on the First Amendment in
Warner Center at 8 p.m. Con-
tact, the student organization
designed to make a wide range
of public speakers available to
the W&L community, will fund
the event, to which admission
will be free.

Mike Skardon, co-chairman
of Contact, said that the title for
the presentation will be, ‘‘Peo-
ple’s Right to Know: What Are
The Limits of First Amendment

Rights?”
Several topics were sug-
gested to Contact by the

speakers, and the students then
made a decision on the specific
subject for the _ debate.
Ehrlichman and McCarthy
spoke on a similar topic when
they recently debated in
Chicago.

Skardon said that¢the two will
cover ‘‘censorship and stuff like
that’’ and local journalists have
been invited to discuss the
“practical problems’’ involved
with the application of the free
press provision of the Constitu-
tion.

Contact’s other co-chairman,
Mike Drinkwater, said that
following the debate, the
speakers will accept questions
from the audience. He said that
the two will also be questioned
by ‘‘a board of several people”’
which will be composed of ‘‘a
few area news people, some
students, and some _ pro-
fessors.”’

The debate, Drinkwater said,
will cost Contact $8,000 plus
travel and lodging expenses for
Ehrlichman and McCarthy. He
said that the group obtained the
rights to the debate for Virginia
and Washington, D.C.

The Contact spokesman said
the debate is expected to draw
national media attention, with
Time and Playboy planning to
send correspondents.

Editorial

Press Freedom —.

By TED LeCLERCQ
Phi Staff Writer

A battle concerning freedom of the press moved in-
to a Washington, D.C. circuit courtroom. One main
principle entwined in the court controversy is
whether a student newspaper has the right of
‘freedom of speech” as guaranteed in the consitu-
tion. In effect, can a student newspaper publish
damaging, yet accurate facts about the university
with which is is affiliated without being censored or
closed.

Howard University President James Check decided
that the campus newspaper, Hilltop, could not print
material that damaged the university because it was
supported with university funds. Essentially, this
means the Howard University administration has
ultimate control (i.e. censorship) over the Hilltop.

According to the Washington Post, the hearing will
proceed on Thursday, February 24. Judge George
Goodrich will rule whether Janice McKnight should
be reinstated in school and as editor of the Hilltop.

McKnight was relieved of her editing post, and ex-
pelled from school on February 1, 1983. These ac-
tions came after McKnight published a series of ar-
ticles that president Cheek asked her to suppress.
Pressure was even placed on McKnight’s mother.
Carl Anderson, vice-president for student affairs, told
Mrs. McKnight that if her daughter didn’t stop the
Harris stories, her ‘‘career at Howard University, her
opportunities to attend graduate school and her future
career in journalism’”’ would be jeopardized.

The controversial articles involved a_ sex
discrimination suit brought by Michael Harris, a
Howard lawyer. The articles so disturbed the univer-
sity trustees that they set up a group of lawyers to
review and censor harmful articles that students
planned to run in the Hilltop.

The reason the university gave for expelling
McKnight, a senior, was that she failed to report a
year she spent at Syracuse University before attend-
ing Howard. When McKnight filled out the Howard
application, she failed to list her academically unsuc-
cessful year at Syracuse. This type of omission gives
Howard legitimate grounds to expel McKnight.

However, it did not give them grounds to censor
what the Hilltop printed. McKnight countered by fil-
ing suit. She asked in her suit to be reinstated as
editor and as a student.

On February 8, Judge Goodrich issued a temporary
order reinstating McKnight until a hearing could be
held. In issuing the temporary ruling, Judge Goodrich
said it was ‘a mighty strange coincidence’’ that
McKnight’s expulsion so closely followed the Harris
articles.

Judge Goodrich further ruled that the university
“cease and desist from interfering with (her) exer-
cise of free press rights guaranteed by the. . .United
States Constitution.”

At W&L, President John Wilson thinks that
“academic freedom, that is to say, the freedom of
faculty to teach, unimpeded by considerations of tact
or politics...is the essential feature of our corporate
life. To encroach upon the freedom of student editors
to pursue, in a responsible way, stories of interest to
the community is to erode that central dispensation —
i.e. academic freedom.”’

Jonson’s EC role praised

To the Editor:
As indicated by the author,
the mid-term reviews of the
members of the Executive
Committee were, for the most
part, “fair and complimen-
tary.” The assessment, how-
ever, of Dave Jonson,
sophomore representative, was
neither fair nor accurate. As a
matter of fact, by understating
his accomplishments and con-
tributions to the Executive
Committee, Rick Swagler’s
review has done a grave disser-
vice to Dave Jonson and the
Sophomore class. Besides par-
ticipating in a successful drive
to have the drop-add fee
lowered, Mr. Jonson has in-

vestigated potential uses of the
University Breathalyzer, and
has led an evaluation of the
long-term effectiveness of. an
Alcohol Awareness program on
canipus. Moreover, Mr. Jonson
is currently serving as a
member of a subcommittee in-
vestigating the feasibility of an
on-campus recreation area and
is ad-hoc member of the Student
Control Committee.

It is an incorrect assumption,
on the part of Mr. Swagler, to
equate effectiveness with ver-
bosity. What the sophomore
class needs, and what it cur-
rently has in Dave Jonson, is a
representative who is willing to
make personal sacrifices and
who is committed to the perfor-

mance of his responsibilities.
Mr. Swagler has failed to
specify any adequate criterion,
other than personal opinions, by
which to evaluate Dave Jon-
son’s performance on_ this
year’s committee. Moreover,
Mr. Swagler neglects to men-
tion that his review was written
irrespective of any considera-
tion of Dave Jonson’s contribu-

_ tions in honor hearings or in the

investigation of honor offenses;

both of which have more bear-

ing on his performance as

sophomore representative than

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for the Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the Editor-in-Chief and Business Manager, but the Ring-tum
Phi is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in the Ring-tum Phi office, room 206 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m, Monday of the week they are to be run. This newspaper
observes current court definitions of libel and obscenity.
By MARK MITSCHOW
Special to the Phi

The Executive Committee is
beginning to run out of money
according to Morgan Griffith,
vice president of the commit-
tee.

The EC has three sources of
funds remaining. In the com-
mittee’s own operating budget
there is approximately $1,062.
In addition to this there is $915
in a fund for student groups in
financial trouble and $3,500 in
emergency funds. This leaves
the EC with about $5,500 out of a
total budget of $102,000 and an
EC budget of $2,800. ‘‘We’re low
on funds, but we should make it
without dipping into the

emergency fund,” Griffith said.
“I’ve never heard of the entire
student government running
out of money,”’ he added.

The primary drain on the
committee’s resources this
year has been been two expen-
sive public honor trials. While
the university pays for large ex-
penses such as_ providing
transcripts and paying expert
witnesses (such as handwriting
experts), the committee is
responsible for printing, sup-
plies and other minor bills.
While the cost for these
materials was substantial, Grif-

‘fith was unable to provide an

exact figure. ‘“‘That all gets
charged to supplies, printing

EC scrapes the bottom of the bucket

and the like, so I can’t tell you
exactly how much each trial
cost,’’ he said.

Another big drain was last
year’s Fancy Dress Ball, which
ran heavily in the red. ‘‘That
FD fiasco cost us some valuable
fat, but even then we didn’t go
in the red,”’ Griffith explained.

The state of the emergency
fund reflects that drain. In 1977,
when the committee feared a
possible breach of contract suit
from a local band, the fund was

_at $17,000. Since then, however,

the EC has shaved the fund
down to its present $3,500. To
repair this situation Griffith is
proposing that the committee
increase the EC’s allotment by
adding $4,500 to the emergency

fund.
The EC has already taken

some action to meet the pro-
blem. Since the entire budget
for student activities comes
from the mandatory fees paid
by all students, the committee
has decided to increase next
year’s fee by $10. Five dollars of
this will go to the mock conven-
tion while the remainder will go
toward funding activities.

What would happen if there
were another honor trial or
other expense that put the com-
mittee into the red? Griffith
replied, “‘If we run out of money
I do believe that the university
would bail us out. I have no way
of knowing this for sure,
however.”’

Draft report for University Scholars program

(Editor’s note: The following
is a preliminary draft of a
report from the faculty Com-
mittee on Honors and Capstone
Courses. “We are circulating
this draft of our report in order
to solicit opinions which we
might incorporate into a final
report to be submitted to the
faculty for action,” the Com-
mittee wrote in a letter to the
Phi. “We would encourage
discussion of the suggestions of
the report within the University
community, and the com-
munication of ideas and com-
ments to any member of the
committee, either orally or in
writing.”

It is proposed that
Washington and Lee institute a
program of University Scholars
in order to serve better the
ablest students in each aca-
demic class. Such a program
would bring these students
together for intellectual
stimulation, both in credit-
bearing courses and extra-
mural activities, and it would
allow them in their first two
years to undertake tutorials
and, if instructors agree,
courses ordinarily not open to
beginning students. A highly
visible, university-wide  pro-
gram would also draw attention
to the work of these students,
setting it forth as an example to
other students. It should help
Washington and Lee to retain
excellent students who might
otherwise transfer to another
school, and it might assist in
recruiting intellectually am-
bitious students, as well.

Out of each academic class,
10 or 15 students — enough for
one seminar — would be
selected to participate in the
program. Roughly half this
number would be chosen on the
basis of information submitted
in support of their applications
for admission to Washington
and Lee. Personal interviews
with candidates for the pro-
gram during scholarship week-
ends would help to identify the
best qualified among them, and
those appointed would be

notified before the deadline for
accepting admission to the
school. The other participants
would be named after the fail
term of their freshman year,
permitting first-term grades,
faculty recommendations, and
personal interviews to be used
in evaluating applicants.

Those chosen as University
Scholars would begin par-
ticipating in the program’s for-
mal activities during the winter
term of their freshman year.
They would be expected to read
then a small but challenging list
of works, which would be dis-
cussed during informal
meetings (perhaps 6) with the
program’s advisers and other
faculty members. (Sometimes
the meetings, like sessions of
the Alumni College, could be
prefaced by lectures.) During
the spring term, one three-
credit seminar would be
presented on a topic enough in
line with these common
readings so that participants
could draw upon them.

University Scholars would
continue in the program for
their sophomore and junior
years, taking each year one of

the two three-credit seminars
offered within the program dur-
ing the long terms. For those
who chose, the senior year of
the program would be spent in
honors programs in their ma-
jors, culminating in major pro-
jects or theses. Each remaining
student would design and carry
out a project or thesis roughly
equivalent in substance to those
required to earn honors in a ma-
jor.

Each of the three seminars of-
fered yearly by the program
would be organized and presid-
ed over by one professor, who
would use “primary’”’ texts
(Machiavelli's ‘‘The Prince,”’
as opposed to a textbook on
Renaissance politics) from
beyond the confines of his or her
own discipline, as well as from
within it; the professor would
also determine the most effec-
tive method of instruction
(team teaching, ‘‘guest ap-
pearances,’’ solo flight).
Seminars could be constructed
around topics, like theories of
social justice, or historical
periods, like medieval Europe.
Each year one seminar would

be led by humanist, one by a
social scientist, and one by a
natural scientist. From time to
time the University Scholars
Committee would invite all
faculty members to propose
seminar topics, would select
some for the _ following
academic year after consulting
students in the program, and
would award small summer
stipends to assist professors in
developing those seminars.
During the freshman and
sophomore years participants
in the program would also have

the Oxbridge mode. These
tutorials would allow the stu-
dent to read more extensively
than he would in a regular ver-
sion of the course, to work out
his own ideas in weekly essays,
and to sharpen and extend his
thinking in weekly conversa-
tions springing from the essays
he would present to his instruc-
tor. Tutorials would be chosen

themselves to this method of

very impressed with the pro-
gram and thought it would be
good publicity for the universi-
ty, and we agreed,” Drinkwater
said. ‘‘They asked about having
some national reporters.”’

Ehrlichman isn’t the first
Watergate luminary to visit the
campus. Previous Contact
speakers have included G. Gor-
don Liddy and Sam Ervin.

At its Jan. 17 meeting, the Ex-
ecutive Committee commended
Contact ‘profusely’ for its
work in arranging the debate.

John Ehrlichman served Nix-
on first as Counsel to the Presi-
dent and later as Assistant to
the President for Domestic Af-
fairs. In April 1973, with the
Watergate scandal developing
all around him, he resigned,
saying that it had ‘‘become in-
creasingly evident _ that,
regardless of the actual facts, I
have been a target of public at-
oe.”

In March 1974, he was in-
dicted for conspiracy and
obstruction of justice in connec-
tion with the Watergate break-
in and cover-up. He was also
charged with lying to both the
grand jury and the FBI. In addi-
tion, he was indicted on similar
charges — conspiracy and per-
jury to a grand jury and the FBI
— in the so-called ‘“‘Plumbers”’
case.

He was found guilty of three
counts of perjury and one count
of conspiracy, and was sentenc-
ed to serve at least 20 months in
jail. At the Watergate trial after
the resignation of President
Nixon, Ehrlichman was con-
victed of obstruction of justice,
conspiracy, and making false
declarations to a grand jury. He
was also removed from the bar.

Eugene McCarthy’s Senate
career was distinguished by his
vocal and vigorous support of
liberal issues. During the Ken-
nedy administration, he cham-
pioned medical care for the
aged and other social reforms
presented by the administra-
tion.

During the Johnson years,
McCarthy was what one
reference source calls “the
Senate’s foremost opponent to
the Johnson Administration’s
Vietnam war policy.’’ He said
the war was ‘‘morally indefen-
sible” and called the Presi-
dent’s actions ‘‘dangerous.”’

After an unsuccessful 1968
Presidential campaign, McCar-
thy continued his opposition to
the war, decrying Nixon’s
“Vietnamization’”’ policy. He
resigned from the Senate in 1971
and made unsuccessful bids for
the Presidency in 1972 and 1976.

  

 

 

  
   
   
  
  
  
   
   

Wenske : Use the market

Stock market analyst Paul
Wenske told a Washington and
Lee University audience Thurs-
day (Feb. 25) that “if you can
afford to have some of your
money on Wall Street, you pro-
bably can’t afford-not to.”

Speaking as part of W&L’s
Contact ’83, a speaker sym-
posium sponsored jointly by the
interfraternity council and the
student body, Wenske provided
advice for prospective investors
based on his personal ex-
periences and gave his predic-
tions for the future of the
market.

Wenske characterized the
stock market as ‘‘an instant
photograph of a significant
chunk of America.”’

In the long run, he said, “‘the
market will respond to forces
more powerful than itself, such

as a truly expanding economy.
But in the short run, it is dif-
ficult to predict
because its behavior is so uns-
cientific and illogical.”’

He warned potential investors
that ‘‘you will lose money’’ but
added: ‘‘Don’t let that bother
you. You don’t always have to
be a winner. You’re just trying
to win more often than you lose.
That’s not as hard as it sounds.”’

Before entering the market,
Wenske suggested that rather
than analyzing stocks ‘‘the in-
itial analysis you do...should be
of yourself. Are you capable of
resisting the jostle of the
crowd? Can you train yourself
to develop an intelligent in-
vesting program, then stick to it
when all the people at the
cocktail party tell you you’re

University Scholars

(continued from page 3)

Instructors would also be en-
couraged to relax prerequisites
for University Scholars, if they
judged that they could manage
the work without taking the
prerequisite course or courses.

Thus, a program of Universi-
ty Scholars would offer intellec-
tually ambitious and able
students opportunities to under-
take independent and advanced
work early in college. These
would be the chief inducements
for applying to the program,
just as they would be the chief
reasons for creating it in the
first place. A few other special
benefits might also attract ex-
cellent students. Those in pro-
gram would be recognized by
the designation ‘University

Schlars’’; that title would ap-

pear on their transcripts, and a
description of the program
would accompany any copy of
the transcript sent out. They
would be recognized publicly
during the Phi Beta Kappa
assembly. They would be in-
vited periodically to lunch with
distinguished guests and to at-
tend a yearly retreat at
Skylark.

Courses within the program
and tutorials would be graded
according to the standard letter
system of Washington and Lee,
coupled with written evalua-
tions by seminar directors and
tutors. Each University Scholar
would be expected to fulfill the
same distribution and major re-

quirements as any other Wash-

ington and Lee _ student,
although the seminars might be

precisely

    

crazy? You need objectivity, a
desire to learn, and the ability
to learn from your mistakes.”’

He advised first-time in-
vestors to “‘walk before you run,
buy with cash, do not buy on
margin, and buy only what you
can afford.”

Asked his impressions of the
market’s future, Wenske quoted
two newsletters which sug-
gested the market is headed for
a spill ‘‘perhaps as much as 100
to 150 points.”

But he tempered that state-
ment by observing that ‘‘it
seems the market has so much
‘head steam’ right now and just
keeps barrelling ahead....”’

Added Wenske: “In Wall
Street, the sensational may
tend to make better headlines,
but the undramatic makes
more money.”

used to meet some aspects of
the former.

This 12 or 15 credit program
(three seminars plus a three to
six credit thesis) would require
a program director who would
be compensated by released
time from some academic
duties, academic advisers for
the students who would be
relieved of other advises, and
teaching faculty (enough to of-
fer three seminars a year) who
would be given released time
from other teaching duties.
(These three categories are not
anticipated to be mutually ex-

clusive.) The director would be

appointed by the university’s
President, as would an advisory
committee of faculty members
(on three-year terms) and
students.

IFC sets committees, budget

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

The Interfraternity Council
created two subcommittees, set
the date for office nominations
and extended a billing date in
its Tuesday night meeting.

Nominations for the positions
of IFC president and vice prési-
dent are due Tuesday, March 8.
The election for these two posi-
tions will include both fraterni-
ty members and independent
voters.

The IFC established a sub-
committee to rewrite the coun-
cil’s constitution which, accor-
ding to IFC treasurer Emery
Ellinger, is a much needed task.

“It’s been a long time since it

has been rewritten,”’ noted Ell-
inger who added that the move
was instigated by Assistant
Dean of Students Dan Murphy.
Ellinger said he expected the
revision to be finished before
the year’s end.

A second subcommittee was
created Tuesday night to ex-
amine the fall rush schedule.
This action follows a request by
the Student Affairs Committee
last spring to re-examine the
fall rush which was adopted for
1982. The SAC met continually
last spring to study several op-
tions for Rush and asked that
Rush be periodically reviewed.

The study will consider the
problems of the past year and
how to avoid them for the com-
ing Rush, Ellinger said.

Ellinger also said that bills
due to the IFC from fraternities
were extended one week to the

following Tuesday due to the |

confusion of Fancy Dress week.
He warned that bills not paid on
time will result in social proba-
tion.

In other action, the IFC has
finalized its projected 1983-84
budget. The total budget is
divided into two billed parts
which include a one item bill for
$7,500, which the IFC donates to
the Contact Fund, and a four
item sum of $11,913 which is
made up of various expenses.

The Contact funding is charg-
ed through each fraternity ac-
cording to its number of
members, Ellinger said, and
each house will be charged $8.98

Summers at Oxford

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

Going to school in the sum-
mer is not on everybody’s list of
priorities, but attending St.
Anne’s College in Oxford,
England, for the summer holds
much greater allure. Wash-
ington and Lee, along with five
other schools in the area, offers
a five-week, six credit study
program at the Oxford college
taught by British ‘‘dons”’ in the
British teaching method, unlike
other study curriculums taught
by American professors.

“The St. Anne’s program is
taught in the British method. In
the literature course, the
tutorial method is used. The stu-
dent presents his paper to an
Oxford tutor and two other
students, and they critique it. In
the history course, lecture and
discussion constitute the
classwork. The student de-
velo, careful arguments. Ex-
ams 2 non-existent,’’ noted
English Professor Edwin
Craun, adding that the program
is the only W&L sanctioned pro-
gram in the summer.

While few W&L students par-
ticipate in the program (only
four W&L students went last
summer), Craun_ believes
greater publicity would attract
more interest. One benefit of
the program few realize, he jok-
ed, is that 20 out of the 30
students who participate are
girls.

“Originally, the St. Anne’s
program was run by Mary
Baldwin and Davidson (N.C.)
Colleges, but Davidson broke
off and formed its own pro-
gram. Now, Sweet Briar, VMI,
Hampden-Sydney, Mary Bald-
win, and W&L run the pro-
gram,” he said.

Richard Jones ’83C_par-
ticipated last summer and
would go back again if he had
the opportunity.

“I wish I could do justice to
my experience over there. Ox-

ford is a great community. The
lectures are very interesting.
The foreign students you meet
are nice. It’s really enjoyable,
not like going to school,”’ Jones
said.

Jones spoke highly of the lec-
turers especially. One lecturer
he heard this past summer is
the author of one of his text-
books this year. The experience
of being in another country add-
ed to Jones’ impression also.

“It took me a while to get us-
ed to the tutorial system. The
tutors are geared to the Ameri-
can students, and meeting with

other students to discuss your -

paper helps you improve a lot.
At first, we held our tutorials in
the tutor’s office, and then we
held many in a_ pub,” he
remarked. ‘‘Believe me, Oxford
has many pubs!”

On the weekends, Jones and
other students took advantage
of low rental rates for cars and
toured the British countryside

and London. He found the

 

British museums impressive
and enjoyed exploring London.

“T found the English people
very accommodating,” Jones
said.

According to Assistant Dean
Pamela Simpson, faculty ad-
viser to the program, credit for
the two courses cannot be used
toward major requirements,
but it does count toward
distribution credit.

“That doesn’t mean we don’t
want English and History
students — we do. But we also
want other students,’’ Simpson
noted.

“I encourage my English ar-
chitecture classes to go. They
have had adequate insight into
British culture and _ history
through it.”

Cost for the trip this year is
$1,700, excluding airfare. While
applications were due March 1,
Simpson said she would accept
applications up until March 11.

 

per member.

The four item remainder of
the budget is also charged to
each fraternity per member.
The projected charge for the
$11,913 non-Contact sum is ap-
proximately $4.98 per member.

The largest item aside from
the Contact donation is a $5,300
fund to pay the room and board
of two exchange students which
takes up 44 percent of the non-
Contact budget.

Ellinger said he feels that
because not many people know
about this fund, the IFC is often
attacked for being totally
fraternity oriented.

Twenty-eight percent of the
budget ($3,413) has been allot-
ted for the Rush guidebook.
Twenty percent ($2,500) is pro-
jected for the cost of the spring
IFC party weekend, and five
percent is set aside for
miscellaneous expenses.

Aside from fraternity taxes
which account for 41 percent of
the IFC’s income, costs are paid
with freshman Rush registra-
tion (41 percent), Rush book
advertisements (11 percent),
and fines on fraternities (5 per-
cent).

Ellinger noted that these pro-
jected figures were estimates
taken from the 1982-83 IFC

| budget.

 

Youth science

You have heard, no doubt, of
Little League Baseball and
youth soccer and the Pop
Warner Football League.

But have you ever heard of
Little League Chemistry? How
about youth psychology? The

Albert Einstein’ Physics
League? You haven’t?
Although it goes by a

somewhat more sophisticated

Formed last fall through the
joint efforts of Dr. Frank A. Set-
tle, professor of chemistry at
VMI, and Dr. H. Thomas
Williams, professor of physics
at W&L, the Lexington

SAE Bomb scare | LHS students

By RLCK SWAGLER
Phi News Editor

About 15 members of the
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE)
fraternity interrupted their
television viewing Sunday night
to take a chilly half-hour stroll
on Washington Street. Their
walk was not prompted by a
desire for fresh air, but by a
false bomb threat.

Gray Sanders, a resident of
the house, answered the phone
at about 10:30 that night.

‘“Who’s this?’’ a voice
demanded.

‘Who's this?’’ Sanders
replied.

“There’s a bomb in your
basement, mother---,”’ the voice
said.

Sophomore Tom Pearce was
in the house when the call came

in. ‘‘We all kind of laughed it
off,” he said.

Acting Police Chief Bruce
Beard of the Lexington Police
Department said that his
department received a call
from Sanders reporting the
threat at 10:34 p.m. Officers
Zollman, Spain and Pedersen
responded.

While the members of the
house stood out in the cold,
house president Bert Ponder
and house manager Ed Griffin
searched the basement with
Zollman, failing to find the pur-
ported bomb.

When asked about the
possibility of future bomb
threats, Beard said, ‘‘I hope this
is it. We don’t need them.’’ The
department is continuing its in-
vestigation.

has traditionally been aimed at
athletics,” said Williams. ‘‘It
seems only appropriate that we
do the same sort of thing in
other areas. Personally, I had
spent a lot of time with various
athletic leagues. And I began to
worry that I had been neglec-
ting the possibility of similar
volunteer work in an area
where I have some expertise.”

Settle and Williams began the
program by enlisting the
volunteer assistance of a half
dozen of their colleagues and
then contacting Lexington High
School officials to offer their
services.

The result has been that 18
Lexington High School juniors
and seniors have been par-
ticipating in the program this
year, spending an hour or two
each week working on an
almost one-to-one basis with
one of the university professors
who volunteered.

For instance, Col. Richard B.
Minnix, professor of physics at
VMI, has two students working
on a project involving laser
photography; W&L psychology
professor Leonard Jarrard has
two students participating in his
continuing research into the
brain; and, Lt. Col. Henry D.
Schreiber, associate professor
of chemistry at VMI, had two
students studying the chemical
properties of glass.

The other professors working
as volunteers in the program
are Dean Foster and Richard
RiCharde,_ professors of
psychology at VMI; Lt. Col.
Kenneth A. Abernethy,
associate professor of
mathematics at VMI; and,
Robert Wilson Sr., retired
chairman of the mathematics
department at Ohio Wesleyan
and formerly a mathematics
professor at W&L.

‘“‘We have a unique situation
in Lexington with two colleges
possessing excellent science

ject,”

 

and mathematics depart-
ments,’’ said Settle. ‘‘Over the
years, we have been able to
develop close relationships with
the science and mathematics
teachers in the high school. We
have, I think, tried to help out
without attempting to domi-
nate, which could be a danger.
The relationship was already
there. This was a way to further

 Oncé Settle and Williams had
recruited their volunteers and
the high school had helped iden-
tify students who had interests
and potential in science and
mathematics, the program
began by offering the students
choices of the projects in which
they wanted to participate.
“After the students selected
the project, they began working
on their own with the professor
involved in that particular pro-
explained Williams.
“Mostly, it has involved be-
tween one and two hours each
week, although some of the pro-
jects may involve work at

home ”
As Settle observed, the

students will not be discovering
any new theories of relativity.

“In the time frame we have,
there are not going to be any
scientific breakthroughs,’’ Set-
tle said. ‘‘That is not the point,
however. What we can do in this
time frame is expose the
students to the more sophis-
ticated equipment the colleges
possess and also expose them to
a close working relationship
with scientists and mathemati-
cians to see how they think and
how they work.

“The student participants do
not receive grades. Nor do they
get any credits for the work.

“On one level, they are in-
volved simply because it is in-
teresting and fun for them,”
said Williams. ‘‘The very basic
goal is simply to get the kids in-
terested.”

Indications are the program
has achieved the goal.

“It has been fantastic from
our point of view,” said Paul
Leonhard, a chemistry teachcr
at Lexington High School who
assisted the Lexington
Academy of Science in organiz-
ing the program. ‘‘Kids are con-
stantly coming to me and show-
ing me the results of the
research they’ve been doing
and are excited about what they
can do.

“The most valuable part of
the program, from what I have
seen, is the way it has taken
some of the intimidation out of
science for some of these
students who might have had
the interest but were a bit in-
timidated.”

Both Settle and Williams em-
phasize the positive role that
Lexington High School has
played throughout the develop-
ment of the program.

Settle and Williams are
hopeful that their young par-
ticipants will eventually turn
their projects into papers that
will be presented each year at
the Virginia Junior Academy of
Sciences (VJAS).

“Henry Schreiber has used
high school students in several
of his funded research projects
in the past and has had a great
deal of success in having those
students present papers to the
Junior Academy,”’ Settle noted.
“In several instances, the
Students have brought back
awards. Our ultimate goal is to
have such papers presented
routinely. We might have
papers generated this year. But
there is not doubt the potential
is there for substantial research
to be reported at such a
statewide meeting in the future.

“That,’”’ Williams adds, ‘“‘is
the students’ Super Bowl.”

In addition to the work being
done on various projects, the
academy’s participants — pro-
fessors and students — meet
formally at various times dur-
ing the year to hear reports on
research, to share experiences,
to eat pizzas, and to play some
volleyball.

“We're experimenting with
the program right now,” noted
Williams. ‘‘We’re looking
around on the national level and
finding what is happening at
various levels of science educa-
tion. There is no question such

The Booth Ferris Foundation
of New York has awarded
Washington and Lee University
a grant of $100,000 to assist in
creating a permanent endow-
ment for the university’s in-
novative program in applied
ethics, ‘“‘Society and the Profes-
sions.”’

.“Society and the Profes-
sions’’ was begun at
Washington and Lee in 1972 as
an experimental program and
was developed under a three-
year grant from the Lilly En-
dowment. The program _in-
cludes seminars in the ethics of
business, journalism, law, and
medicine and is designed to
make pre-professional under-
graduate students in those
areas more aware of the
humanistic dimensions of the
professions they plan to enter.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 3, 1983, Page 7

Booth Ferris grants $100,000

In addition to the semester-
long seminars for under-
graduate students, ‘Society
and the Professions” annually
stages-four workshops in which
practicing professionals join
the W&L students and faculty
members for three days of lec-
tures and discussion sessions.

The Booth Ferris Foundation
began its operations in 1957 with
a trust established by Mrs.
Chancie Ferris Booth and
another trust from the estate of
Willis H. Booth. The combined
trusts created the Booth Ferris
Foundation in 1964.

The foundation makes grants
in the areas of religion, educa-
tion, health, welfare, public af-
fairs, and the arts.

“The trustees of the Booth
Ferris Foundation have long
been concerned with the pro-

blems of higher education, and
of late with the problems of the
small colleges of this country,”’
said Robert F. Longley, a senior
vice president of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company and a
trustee of the Booth Ferris
Foundation.

“Cooperation between educa-
tion and foundations must grow
if we are to find the solutions to
many of the problems that beset
society today.”’

According to Farris P. Hotch-
kiss, W&L’s director of develop-
ment and university relations,
the Booth Ferris Foundation
gift is doubly significant since
in addition to being applied
toward endowing the ‘Society
and the Professions” program,
it qualifies toward a National
Endowment for the Humanities
Challenge Grant.

W&L International Day ‘83

By NELSON PATTERSON

day. Sponsored by the Interna-
tional Club, the day’s activities
sought to commemorate the
diversity among cultures and
bring greater understanding of
those cultures to students.

“I thought it went very well.

While I wish more students had
participated, I think we had a
good number of people turn out
today,” said Henry Baey, presi-
dent of the club, after the even-
ing slide presentation.
Approximately 140 people at-
tended the afternoon feature of

Vlahoplus wins Pinney Prize ;
Prysi awarded English grant

John Vlahoplus, a Wash-
ington and Lee University
senior from Columbia, S.C., is
the 1983 winner of the annual
Edward L. Pinney Prize at the
university.

The prize was awarded to
Vlahoplus by a vote of the

University Council, an
organization composed of
students, faculty, and ad-

ministration at Washington and
Lee.

Awarded for the first time in
1982, the Pinney Prize was
established by the Washington
and Lee faculty in memory of
the late Edward Lee Pinney,
professor of politics at W&L
who died in 1980. The Pinney
Prize recognizes extraordinary
commitment both to personal
scholarship and to the nurturing
of intellectual life at
Washington and Lee.

Vlahoplus is an economics

major and has been elected to
Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta
Kappa, and Who’s Who. He is a
senior class representative to
the Executive Committee,
W&L’s student government
body.
A graduate of Heathwood
Hall Episcopal School in Colum-
bia, he is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Christopher Vlahoplus Sr.
of Columbia.

Scott Prysi, a Washington and
Lee University junior from
Alexandria, Va., is one of three
students from Virginia colleges
to be awarded a grant from the
English-Speaking Union for
summer study in Great Britain.

The award, administered by
the Richmond branch of the
English-Speaking Union, pro-
vides an opportunity for
students from Virginia to take
courses in an English or Scot-
tish University and to travel in
Great Britain in order that they
may have a more intimate
knowledge and understanding
of the British people.

The program serves to carry
out the purpose of the English-
Speaking Union — the promo-
tion of understanding, goodwill,
and peaceful cooperation
among all the people of the
world who speak the English
language.

Prysi will use the grant to
study Shakespearean drama
and Elizabethan history at
Stratford on Avon for six weeks
this summer.

The grant is awarded on the
basis of literary and scholastic
ability and evidence of potential
leadership along with other
qualities as determined in ap-
plication ‘procedures and
through a series of interviews.

Pressler named

VMI lax coach

By JOHN PERKINSON
Special to the Phi

“There’s another lacrosse
team in Lexington,’’ said Mike
Pressler, recently appointed
coach of the new Virginia
Military Institute lacrosse pro-
gram and former W&L lacrosse
andfootballstar.  —_

Pressler was referring to the
VMI lacrosse team’s recently
achieved status as Division I.
Mike Strickler, sports informa-
tion director at VMI said prior
to this year, the lacrosse pro-
gram had existed under club
status since about 1970.

According to Pressler, work
for the change in status occured
“when Gen. Walker, the new
superintendent, arrived.

“He is an All-American from
West Point and is the one behind
this lacrosse program. He gave
it varsity status and pushed to
become a Division I team,”
Strickler said.

   

MIKE PRESSLER

Pressler, who graduated
from Washington and Lee last
year, said his appointment as
head coach came as a surprise.
“TI was hired two weeks before
the first practice,’ he noted.
“That didn’t give me much time
to get ready.”

However, Sean McNulty, the
assistant VMI lacrosse coach
and current W&L junior, work-
ed with the team this fall. He
organized practices and cut the
team down to 32 players.

Players on the VMI lacrosse
team practiced for a month on
their own before Pressler arriv-
ed in early February. The new
coach said the team will have
about three weeks of practice
with him before its opening

game against Babson College
on March 17.

Pressler described this year’s
1l-game schedule as “pretty
competitive for the first year.”
The Keydets will play such
teams as Virginia Tech,
Guilford, Western Maryland,
Randolph Macon, New York
Pottsdam and Bucknell.

When asked if his strategy
resembles W&L lacrosse coach
Jack Emmer’s, Pressler
replied there are ‘‘a couple of
different wrinkles, but it’s
basically a W&L clone.”

The Keydets will use one of-
fense. “It’s the same offense
that W&L runs, a one-three-
two,’’ said Pressler. He added
that the W&L lacrosse squad
uses more variations which the
Keydets are not ready for
because of their inexperience as
ateam.

“Some of these guys haven’t
played a year, so we can’t over-
whelm them with all kinds of
strategies. They’ve got to work
on the basics — catching,
throwing and scooping ground
balls,” said Pressler.

When asked about his expec-
tations for this season, the new
coach replied, “I told the team
the first day, ‘Let’s just be com-
petitive. We shouldn’t set any
goals as far as wins and losses
go. We have a competitive
schedule; let’s take one game at
a time and play it that way.’ ”’

Pressler said his transition
from player to coach has been a
smooth one, even though he had
anticipated some problems. ‘‘At
first, I was really worried. I’m
the same age as a lot of these
guys. But they have a good
group over there. They have a
really good attitude and are
very receptive tocoaching.” _

Before his position at VMI,
Pressler was a graduate assis-
tant football coach at Hampden
Sydney. He left after the season
and returned to his home state
of Connecticut. There, he did
odd jobs and worked as a
Nautilus instructor until he was
contacted by VMI.

At Washington and Lee,
Pressler was a history major.
He was captain of the lacrosse
team and earned four letters.
Pressler also was captain of the
football team and made the
Kodak All-American and All-
ODAC (Old Dominion Athletic
Conference) teams.

Generals down
Blue Devils in
season opener

By JOHN HARRISON

Geoff Wood and Jeff Mason
combined for seven goals to
lead Washington and Lee to a
12-8 victory over Duke yester-
day on Wilson Field in the
season opener for the Generals.
The Blue Devils, who beat
Boston College 9-5 in their
opener, dropped to 1-1.

Although W&L trailed only
once, 1-0, the Generals never
led by more than three goals un-
til Wood scored the first goals of
the fourth quarter to make it 9-5
with 12:33 remaining. Duke
drew as close as 9-7 on two goals
witin 16 seconds of each other,
but tallies by Rod San-
tomassimo at 8:13 and Mason at

6:16 restored the four-goal
margin and a 11-7 lead.

Freshman goalie Lewis
Brewster, playing behind an
unsteady defense, kept Duke in
the game. Several of his 18
saves came off uncontested
shots from close range. The
Blue Devils’ attack was paced
by junior Hunt Brawley’s two
goals and four assists.

Freshman Chris John, a
defensive midfielder, and
veterans Steve Conboy and Tim
Schurr were major factors in
the Generals’ ability to keep the
ball away from Duke most of
the game. John intercepted
several attempted clearing
passes and Schurr and Conboy
helped W&L limit Duke to 18

 

 

 

shots on goal. Sophomore Rich
Schoenberg, who won eight of
his nine faceoffs, also con-
tributed to W&L’s ball control.
Santomassimo and John Doub
collected two goals each to com-
plete the Generals’ attack.

The Generals, who won’t
return to regular season action
until Saturday, March 12, at

Cagers bow to Roanoke

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

After defeating Maryville in
the quarterfinals, Washington
and Lee’s basketball team end-
ed its season Saturday with a
tough loss to Roanoke in the
semifinals of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tourna-
ment.

W&L finished the season with
an overall record of 17-10 and an
ODAC mark of 9-7.

‘There were times when we
played well, and there were
times when we just didn’t play
together as a team,’ senior
Frank Eppes said about W&L’s
performance this year.

The Generals played very
well against Maryville College
in the Warner Center last
Thursday, beating the Scots
77-59.
of the game, the Generals led
all the way. W&L led by as
much as 20 points during the
first half, and held a comfor-
table 41-23 lead at the interrnis-
sion.

W&L continued to increase its
lead in the second half, holding
leads of 29 points on two occa-
sions. Only a late surge by the

Swimming

Seots narrowed the final deficit
to 18 points.

Eppes led the Generals with
21 points. Juniors John Lee
Graves and Billy Yates added
14 and 12 points respectively.

Saturday the nationally
second-ranked Roanoke College
Maroons defeated W&L 65-60
despite a strong effort by the
Generals.

“‘T think we felt like we played
well on the whole,”’ Eppes said.
“We played together as a team
and that’s what counts,” he
said.

The lead switched hands on
several occasions in the first
half. W&L grabbed its last lead
of the game at 31-30 with 2:49
left to play in the half on a
basket by Eppes. A three point
play by Roanoke’s All-Amer-
ican forward Gerald Holmes
with five seconds left in the half
gave the Maroons a 37-33 lead at
halftime.

W&L played much of the first
half without Yates because the
junior guard had picked up
three personal fouls early in the
game. Sophomores David
Wilkinson and Jackson Mac-
Farlane contributed-four and
two points respectively in the

half coming off the bench to
pick up some of the scoring
slack.

In the second half, Roanoke
gradually began to pull away
from the Generals. A basket by
Holmes gave the Maroons a
63-54 lead with a little more than
two minutes to play.

The Generals fought back
furiously though, and pulled to
within 63-58 with 1:10 left in the
game on a basket by Yates. A
basket off a steal by Eppes clos-
ed the gap to 63-60 with nine
seconds remaining. However,
Roanoke’s Donnie Morris hit
two foul shots with eight
seconds left to seal the victory
for the Maroons.

Yates led the Generals’ scor-
ing attack with 16 points despite
missing much of the first half.
Eppes tossed in 14 points, and
senior Brian Hanson added 12
points.

‘“‘We haven’t played anybody
who was better than them this
year,” said Eppes concerning
the second-ranked Maroons.
‘In the past some of the teams
that we saw in New Jersey were
a little better,’’ Eppes said.

Five go to nationals

MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

Coach Page Remillard and
his W&L swimmers went to
Blacksburg last weekend for
the Virginia Senior Champion-
ships with one purpose: to go
faster, fast enough to qualify for
nationals. Faster they went, as
three Generals posted lifetime
bests and two made national
qualifying times, sophomore
Taber Smith and junior Gary
Meyer.

Smith was also added to the
W&L group of qualifiers as a
member of the 400-yard free-
style relay team. Smith will
replace freshman Tim Stanford
on the relay entry by virtue of
his better individual split
achieved last weekend. The
relay team also includes
freshman John Moody, sopho-
more Bobby Pearson and
Meyer.

Meyer added another event,
the 100-free, to his string of na-
tional qualifiers. Due to a tin-

ing malfunction in the 100-free
event, (which Meyer won), the
junior had to qualify with his leg
of the 400-free relay. His time
beat the national standard by
.07 seconds.

Fourth year head coach
Remillard commented on the
individual performances, say-
ing, “They swam real good,
mental races, sticking to their
strategies. We got a lot of

positive feedback.”’
During the weekend, the
Generals achieved three

lifetime bests. Smith outdid his
previous best with a 22.46 clock-
ing in the 50-free. Stanford
achieved his personal best time
in the 200-fly with a 2:01.29.
Rounding out the trio was fresh-

Cavs [Impaled
by Generals

By LEE NICHOLS
Phi Sports Editor

Avenging a poor showing at
the Virginia Cup meet in
Charlottesville the previous
weekend, the W&L fencing
team defeated a highly touted
UVa squad 16-11 this past Satur-
day at VMI.

Revenge for the _ past
weekend’s performance was
especially sweet. At the
Virginia Cup meet hosted by
UVa, the Generals finished fifth
in a_ five-team field. The
Cavaliers captured the title
with 30 bouts; VMI was second
with 28 bouts, William & Mary
third with 27 bouts, VPI fourth
with 18 bouts, and W&L fifth

     
     

with 17 bouts. The outcome was
particularly frustrating for the
team, as the Generals tied
Virginia 6-6 in individual com-
petition. Also, a line-up change
which placed a freshman saber
fencer in foil competition
prevented eight sure forfeits
but did not improve the
Generals’ standing. However,
there were bright spots for two
fencers. Pat Berg placed se-
cond in the state in saber com-
petition, and junior captain
Rick Swagler was named to the
All-State second team in epee.
Knowing full well that they
were capable of defeating the
best fencing team in the state,
the Generals proved equal to
the task by posting an im-
pressive upset victory in Cocke
Hall last Saturday. In saber
competition, Pat Berg was 3-0,
Chuck DePoy 2-1, and Mike
Berg 1-2. In foil competition,
Leigh Kaplan was 2-1, Allen Coe

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

...1 hate to say I told you so
but the USFL reared its ugly
head a week ago with the $5.0
million hardship story of the
late semi-great and soon to be
boring Herschel Walker. We all
know that money talks but rare-
ly does it think before it speaks.
How true of this situation. In
one fell swoop the brilliant
minds at the USFL and New
Jersey Generals ruined the life
of one young man and perhaps
did irreperable damage to the
game of college football.
Herschel was famous before the
deal; he’s now infamous for the
mistake. What mistake, you
say, he’s richer than you or I
will ever be, why not take the
money and run? My answer is
simple: He doesn’t need it. He’ll
get it all and possibly more next
year, he’d have a degree, and
most importantly he’d have a
lot more self-respect. Those
who cry, ‘What if he’s hurt in
his senior year?’ can be
answered with, ‘‘What if he’s
hurt in his rookie year with the
USFL? At least in the former
he’d have an alternative when
he’s told he can’t play anymore.
College football didn’t need this.
College coaches can only hope
that Herschel hasn’t set off a
chain reaction. The American
sports public should have the
same wish.

...On to happier things. Had
the gods been smiling on W&L’s
basketball team last Saturday
Roanoke College would have

Time Out.....

been annihilated in their semi-
final contest with the Generals.
Canfield’s crusaders did not
play as spotlessly as they did in
their first game with the
Maroons. Rather, that day the
entire team epitomized the
word “‘desire.’’ However, the
ball bounced the wrong way
enough times to leave W&L
always a half step behind Roa-
noke. My hat is tipped to these
gentlemen, their coach and

staff for showing the people in
the Salem Civic Center what a
competitor really is...Seniors
Jay Fechtel, Brian Hanson, and
Frank Eppes leave behind them
qualities that define leadership.
Needless to say the trio will be
sorely missed.

..speaking of college hoops,
there appears to be a debate as
to what individual is the game’s
player of the year. The four can-
didates appear to be Dale Ellis,
and Ralph Sampson, Sam
Perkins, and Michael Jordan.
Does it realy need to be such an
issue. Let’s remember it’s a
team game and the only award
that matters is the one
somebody will take home from
Alberquerque at the end of Mar-
ch. Are you listening Terry
Holland?...By the way, whether
or not he wins it, Mr. Ellis is the
best...

..1. leave you with this
thought: W&L is the only col-
lege that can turn a $5 million
athletic complex into a party
ground. I hope that isn’t the
SAB’s opinion of the sports pro-
gram...

Brian Hanson closed out his

career at W&L by scoring 432
points for the Generals this year
and by leading the team with 16
points per game average. Han-
son is the 8th leading scorer in
W&L’s history with a total of
1,338 points. Hanson also was
named to the all-ODAC team for
the second straight year.

The other two seniors on the
team were Frank Eppes and
Jay Fechtel. Eppes, Fechtel
and Hanson were tri-captains
for W&L this year.

John Lee Graves was the
Generals’ second leading scorer
with an average of 15.2 points
per game. Yates averaged 14.4
points per game, and Eppes hit
for 11.6 points per game.

This year’s total of 17 wins
boosted W&L Coach Verne Can-
field’s career total to 310 wins.

In all, the Generals will send
five swimmers to the NCAA
championships scheduled for
March 17-19. Meyer, Smith,
Stanford, sophomore Bobby
Pearson, and freshman John
Moody will represent W&L, as
the Generals make their ninth
straight appearance at the na-
tional championships.

The swimmers will compete
in five events. Meyer will swim
the 50-free as well as the 100-
free, while Moody will swim in
the 100-fly.

Remillard noted that Meyer
has been having some good
times and added “how fast he
goes will depend on good luck.”’

Of Moody, Remillard said,
‘He has a lot of hidden talent. I
see no reason for his super per-
formances not to continue.”

The other two events of na-
tionals for W&L will be the 400-
and 800-freestyle relays. The
$00 team will include Meyer and
Moody along with Stanford and
Pearson.

Heading ° into nationals,
Remillard is optimistic.

“‘We’re in as good shape as
any team could be,” he said.
“No one is in any better mental
shape.”’

POOLSIDE: Meyer swam a
47.92 in last Sunday’s 100-free to
beat out a field of 88, which in-
cluded several former teamates
from his aquatic group in
Roanoke. Remillard is confi-
dent he’ll do well in Canton if he

finished fifth among six teams
last Saturday at the seventh an-
nual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Indoor Champion-
ships at Lynchburg College.

The Generals accumulated 54
points, putting them ahead of
Emory and Henry (42) and
behind Lynchburg (111),
Roanoke (77), Catholic (76) and
Bridgewater (66).

The best individual finish for
the Generals was junior Charlie
Alcorn’s second place in the
shot put — a 42-foot 9-inch toss,
5 inches behind the Lynchburg
competitor.

Third-place honors went to
junior Angus McBride in the
two-mile run, and freshman
Townes Pressler in the high
jump, and the two-mile and 440-
yard relay teams.

The championships wrapped
up indoor competition for W&L.
Outdoor competition begins
Saturday, March 12, at home
against Davidson.

‘“‘We’ll be ready when outdoor
rolls around,” offered Aldridge.
