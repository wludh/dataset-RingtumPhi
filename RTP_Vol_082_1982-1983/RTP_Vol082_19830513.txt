Being black:

isolation and

self-doubt

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

Editor’s Note: This is the se-
‘cond of a series on black students
at W&L.

At a predominantly white,
public high school in Columbus,
Ga., Robert Stephen was class
president and active in the stu-
dent council.

A licensed minister since he
‘was 18, he preaches at churches
in Lexington, Staunton and
Pennsylvania. When he
graduates from Washington
and Lee University in a few
weeks he will enter the U.S. Ar-
my as an officer.

He is intelligent, articulate
and unassuming; his leadership
qualities are unquestionable.

He had fully expected to pur-
sue his interests in student
government but soon
discovered that blacks at W&L
were treated like ants at a pic-
nic.

“I didn’t think I would be
wanted,” Stephen said, ‘If I
ran, I felt like it would be a
black student running, not just
a student. You feel set apart;
you wonder if you will be ac-
cepted.”

Consequently, Stephen has

New chief seeks
policy with frats

Phi Staff Writer

Lexington’s new chief of
police said Tuesday that he
wants to talk to student govern-
ment and fraternity leaders at
Washington and Lee University
to establish a clear understand-
ing between the police and
students.

Speaking at a press con-
ference in his second day on the
job, Lawrence O. Sutton, a 53-
year-old former lieutenant with
the Virginia Beach Police
Department, pledged better
communication between the
residents of Lexington and their

police.

“I would like to have a sit-
down session with students,
citizens and the police depart-
ment to reach a mutual ground
we can all live with,”’ he said.

To help improve public trust,

_Sutton promised greater ac-
cessibility, saying he would be
available ‘‘to any citizen at any
time.’’ “‘I will give 125, if not
150, percent to responding to the
‘needs of the department and the
citizens,”’ he said.

He also said he planned to
review the inner workings of the
police force, identify needs and
establish goals and objectives.
At this time, however, he does
not expect to make any signifi-
cant changes.

Describing himself as
naturally curious and a tough
disciplinarian, Sutton said he
would keep ‘‘an attitude of
observation” to prevent a pro-
blem in the future with thefts by
police officers.

“I do not anticipate any pro-
blem of that type,” he said. ‘‘I
doubt very seriously that
anything like that could happen
in my department.”

Last year 13 former and then-
current Lexington police of-
ficers were indicted in connec-
tion with a theft ring that had
been operating within the
department for at least 10
years.

Former chief James A. Kirby
resigned from his post in
January following an inquiry
conducted by L.M. ‘‘Bucky”
Walters, an outside investigator
hired by City Council to study
allegations linking Kirby to the
theft ring.

Although the findings of the
report were never made public,
Kirby was reassigned to a
newly-created post as police in-
spector. He is expected to
assume his new dutiessoon.

Sutton said he would have no
problem working with Kirby,
“tas long as he does his job in his
new capacity as inspector.’’ He
said he had no idea what the
Walters report contained but
that he planned to read it soon.

Curriculum change passed over student apathy

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

The recent uproar over the
changes in curriculum re-
quirements has revived a
longstanding argument over the
decision-making process at the
university. Do students have a
voice in decisions which affect
their academic fate? Does the
faculty listen to student opinion
when it decides important
issues, like the curriculum revi-
sion? Would opening faculty
meetings to students aid in their
communication with professors
or hinder it?

The answers are not easy.
Study the recent curriculum
change proposal. In the fall of
1981, then-President Huntley
petitioned the faculty to study
the W&L curriculum re-
quirements and propose possi-
ble changes. A committee-of-
the-whole formed (faculty only)
and sent letters requesting sug-

gestions for possible changes to
all faculty and the student body
president for relay to the stu-
dent body.

Responses there were. Some
faculty decried the deficiencies
in foreign language, science
and math requirements; others
felt the requirements were too
stringent; some members of the
faculty did not respond.

The latter was also the case
with the student body. In the six
months of its existence, the
committee of faculty members
received no suggestions from
students on the matter which
would directly affect them, if
not future W&L students.

When the committee submit-
ted its proposal last spring for
faculty consideration, there
was a mild student response;
perhaps they did not know or
realize its implications. Return-
ing students in the fall cried un-
fair treatment. The EC — same
group which failed to suggest
any changes — boldy criticized

ine plan in a tersely-worded let-
ter to the faculty and University
Council. Then,.in its March

- meeting, the faculty voted —not

unanimously — to accept the
more stringent and demanding
curriculum changes.

Enter student opposition and
outcry. ‘‘Students have a right
to know what is being debated,”’
wrote Bruce Potter (Phi, April
26, 1983). ‘“‘Students have a right
to participate in the decision-
making process when the out-
come will affect their
academic...situation at the uni-
versity.” :

To what degree does this stu-
dent right extend? The Univer-
sity Council, some professors
argue, is designed for student
grievances against faculty
plans. Did the UC serve its call-
ing when it narrowly approved
(9-8) the curriculum change?
Did students outside of UC
members use the UC. to voice
complaints and opinions? No.

“If students are not in-
terested in attending University
Council meetings, why would
they want to come to faculty
meetings,’’ Dean Watt question-
ed recently, noting that the lat-
ter are lethargic and boring.

Some students say their right
to know mandates the opening
of faculty meetings to students
and press coverage. Many
faculty members shudder at
that thought.

“Opening faculty meetings
would only politicize the situa-
tion. What a teacher feels about
curriculum changes should not
affect a student’s view of his
teaching abilities,’’ Watt
remarked, adding he is sure a
communication barrier would
result.

But, as Potter wrote, couldn’t
the faculty adapt ‘‘secret’’ (or
surprise) measures without stu-
dent opinion ever being sought
or considered? Refer once more

to the curriculum changes.

“Calling the curriculum
changes ‘secret’? That is using
‘secret’ in a way never used
before in the English language.
There was no secret doing. We
(the Committee on Curriculum
changes) made the overture, in-
vited comments. I never receiv-
ed (student) response nor did I
hear of any student response. It
was no secret we _ were
meeting,’ said Dr. Coulling,
member of the now-dissolved
Committee.

“I believe there was suffi-
cient student involvement (on
the change proposal). We (the
faculty) should be informed and
have a broader perspective in
such matters. We ought not to
abdicate faculty responsibili-
ty,’’ Coulling noted, seemingly
contradicting himself. ‘Our
responsibility is to keep inform-

Doctor’s ethics
and the Law

By TED Le CLERQ
Phi Staff Writer

Murder charges have been
brought against two Los
Angeles doctors because they
removed a patients’ life support
systems. As reported in the
New York Times, doctors
Robert Nejdl and Neil Barber
disconnected first the
respirator and then the. in-
travenous food and water of
their patient Clarence Herbert.

Following a _ routine, ap-
parently successful abdominal
surgery performed by both Dr.
Nejdl and Dr. Barber, Herbert
stopped breathing in the
recovery room. He suffered
brain-damage, and entered a
coma. With family approval
five days later, doctors ordered
Herbert removed from all sup-
port. It took six days for him to
die.

When the murder charges
were brought by the L.A.
District Attorney’s office, it
caused an upheaval in the
medical community. Doctors
dared not remove patients from
life support. The District At-
torney’s decision focused atten-
tion on the right (perhaps
obligation) of physicians to
discontinue life support to a pa-
tient with apparent irreparable
and severe brain damage.

As Washington and Lee pro-
fessor and ethical specialist
Louis Hodges points out, ‘‘It is
important to distinguish be-
tween prolongation of life and
prolongation of dying.”’ Herbert
was a comatose, severely-brain
damaged patient that a
neurologist said had virtually
no chance of recovery. Current
laws recognize a doctor’s power
to withhold ‘‘heroic’’ measures
in a hopeless case. However,
the government still has a pro-
tecting role. Hodges agrees that
“the government should be in-
volved to limit causing death,
but not to preventing death
from happening.”’

What does this mean in the
Herbert case? Both Drs. Nejdl

and Barber concluded, with the
outside advice of a neurologist,
that Herbert’s condition was
virtually hopeless.

“Severe brain damage is not
much better than brain death,’’
Dr. Michael Cunningham, at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital,
said.

The decision to prosecute was
inappropriate. When the deci-
sion was made that Herbert’s
death was only being prolonged
by the doctors’ care, the issues
were then when would he die,
and how would he die.

After removal from the
respirator, Herbert still surviv-
ed. Yet, was his condition any
better? He was still virtually a
vegetable. The doctors then
reasoned that since their ac-
tions were only prolonging
death, they would remove the
intravenous food and water. To
the doctors, it was a question of
how Herbert would die rather
than if he would die.

This removal of food and
water is the district attorney’s
reason for prosecuting. Certain-
ly, without careful considera-
tion of the case’s cir-
cumstances, removal of food
and water would seem inap-
propriate. Yet, it is the proper
course here. Within the medical
community, it is the accepted
and correct next step if one is
only prolonging the patients
death. However, the D.A. is pro-
secuting this case without con-
sideration of moral and
philosophical questions about
terminal illness. In a difficult
ethical situation, it is narrow-
minded for the D.A. solely to
concentrate on the facts in
deciding whether to prosecute.

The controversy over the Ne-
jdl and Barber case arose
because of the implications in-
volved in altering the precedent
of when a patient may be allow-
ed to die. Doctors have the
responsibility of not prolonging
death. Nejdle and Barber acted
properly and in accordance
with their best medical judg-
ment.

ORB UNATSAL FRETS SIMU ATE

 

In favor of the ‘squeal rule’

To the Editor:

In response to Mr. LeClerq’s
commentary of April 28, 1983:
The only reason Mr. LeClerg in-
dicates as to why he believes
the ‘‘Squeal Rule’’ to be unjust
is that it ‘‘attacks the privacy of
minors.’’ The question is not
whether the government is in-
vading the privacy of minors by
notifying their parents of their
receipt of contraceptives, but
why the government is in the
contraceptive business in the
first place. It is not the govern-
ment’s responsibility to prevent
births. Supplying contracep-
tives is a misuse of the tax-
payers’ money. Why should the

_American public pay because

some young people cannot con-
trol their sexual urges? The
point that Mr. LeClerq argues,
however, is whether or not
parents should be informed if
their children receive con-
traceptives. The key word here
is ‘‘children.’’ The government
is promoting the sexual activity
of people who are not mature
enough to handle the respon-
sibility. By not notifying the
parents, the government is
breaking up the backbone of
American society — the family.
The government should en-
courage the family to address
these matters in the home. If
this means “attacking the
privacy of minors,” then so be
it.

Concerning the ‘‘Baby Doe
Rule,”’ I must agree with Mr.
LeClerq that machines should
not be used to prolong life
regardless of prognosis. It
would seem as though Mr.
LeClerq is concerned with let-
ting natural course, as am I.
Mr. LeClerg, however, strays
from this principle when he
criticizes the proposed regula-
tion of posting a sign in
hospitals prohibiting the
withholding of food or ordinary
medical care. Withholding food
or ordinary medical care does

not allow a life to follow a
natural course, just as a
machine does not. Mr. LeClerq
seems more concerened with
the possibility of some
bureaucrats investigating an in-
cident in a_ hospital. If
bureaucrats in a hospital are
necessary in order for a han-
dicapped child to receive nor-
mal, proper and natural care,
then so be it.

I also agree with Mr. LeClerg
in that the government should
not have total control of these
medical matters. Guidelines,
however, are not total control.
The government has a respon-
sibility to protect the rights of
its citizens. These rights include
normal, proper and natural
medical care. These guidelines
may include ambiguous terms
such as ‘‘handicap’’ and
“customary care,’ but these
ambiguities are necessary
because every case is different.
Strict, clear cut definitions can-

not be applied to terms which
will affect human life. There
must be some leeway for re-
sponsible people to make deci-
sions.

Mr. LeClerq seems to believe
the medical profession to be
responsible and wise enough to
make decisions regarding the
“quality of life.” For this
reason, he criticizes the
possibility of the government
affecting such decisions. Can a
doctor make this judgment
simply because he understands
the workings of the human
body? I don’t believe his
superior knowledge makes him
more capable of judging the
‘‘quality of life.’”’ Because no
one is in the position to judge
the ‘‘quality of life,”’ the govern-
ment must be involved in order
to protect the rights of its
citizens. The ‘‘Baby Doe Rule”’
is such protection.

A letter to Wilson

Dear President Wilson,
Yesterday I read with great
interest the review in the Ring-
tum Phi of your recent talk
about your first impressions of
Washington and Lee. I was par-
ticularly interested in your
comments about the pro’s and
con’s of co-education. It seems
to me that two very important
considerations are seldom
directly addressed whenever
this issue is raised. The most
important consideration that
must be addressed is the effect
upon the academic environ-
ment that women would make.
This could be both advan-
tageous and deleterious. The
absence of women creates an

Review

U2’s third album is fine

By BRIAN J. OLIGER
Phi Staff Writer

“This is not a rebel song, but
it is a song of disgust.”

When U2 recently opened
their U.S. tour in support of
their third album, War, lead
vocalist Bono Vox introduced
the opening tune on the album,
“Sunday, Bloody Sunday” in
just this way. The song is
characteristic of most of the
album because its lyrics mix a
strong political statement with
a sensitive commentary on
human relationships: ‘“‘And the
battle’s just begun/There’s
many lost, but tell me who has
won?/The trenches dug within
our hearts,/And mother’s
children, brothers, sisters torn
apart/Sunday, bloody Sunday.”

This lyrical style is apparent
in many of the songs and is one
of the primary sources of power
and emotional impact of the
album. The impact is also
heightened by the conviction
with which the material is per-
formed (Vox’s vocals make
many of his contemporaries
sound like chalk on a black-
board) and the raw intensity of
the sound. The band hails from

environment free from the con-
stant distractions of inter-
sexual personal relationships.
(Personally, I have often found
it very convenient that dates
are not always around.) The
academic demands of Washing-
ton and Lee are rigorous and
women can provide a most dif-
ficult distraction. On the other
hand, the potential contribution
that women have to offer cannot
be ignored. By enrolling bright
young women Washington and
Lee would gain not only from
each woman’s _ individual
capability, but also from the
greater appeal of a co-ed
school. Presumably, more men
would compete for fewer open-

Ireland, which lends credibility
and purpose to the political and

emotional insights which per-

vade the album. Consequently,
the lyrics have a moving
forcefulness absent in the
mindless boy/girl scenario por-
trayed by many commercially
successful artists.

The band’s sound hinges both
on Vox’s vocals and on solid
guitar work by The Edge. It is a
hard rock approach with a hint
of new wave and relatively
strong heavy metal influences,
providing a solid but refreshing
sound.

The album continues with.
‘‘Seconds,’’ a song which
perhaps best reveals the theme
and sentiments which U2 is
seeking to convey: “It’s the
puppets, it’s the puppets who
pull the strings/It takes a se-
cond to say goodbye,/Push the
button, pull the plug, say good-
bye/Yes they’re doing the
atomic bomb,/They want you to
sing along,/Say goodbye, say
goodbye.”’

The single ‘‘New Year’s Day”’
exemplifies the thematic com-
plexities of War. Vox sings,
‘And so we are told this is the
golden age,/And gold is the

result that Washington Lee
could enroll only the finest
students.

The second, more rarely men-
tioned consideration is the ef-
fect on the degree of freedom
that is granted to W&L
students. The parents of female
undergraduates have different
expectations of an institution
from those of parents of male
students. For example, all of
the surrounding girl’s schools
have an established set of
parietals and regulations for
male guests. At Washington and
Lee, regulations are determin-
ed democratically by each hall.

reason for the wars we
wage./Though I want to be with
you/To be with you night and
day,/Nothing changes on New
Year’s Day.”

Side two of War is not as
forceful as the first, with the ex-
ception of the last piece, ‘‘40.”’
This is essentially Vox singing
the fortieth Psalm with simple
but effective instrumental ac-
companiment. This cut extends
the Christian theme predomi-
nant on the band’s last album,
October. In ‘Sunday, Bloody
Sunday” this is also evident;
“The real battle just begun/To
claim the victory Jesus
won,/On a Sunday, bloody Sun-
day.”

Other outstanding cuts on the
album are ‘Like a Song...,”
“‘The Refugee,” and ‘‘Drowning
Man,” which is a deeply moving
song but lacks any strong
political statement, perhaps
because there simply isn’t room
for it beyond the emotional con-
tent of the piece. Judging by the
critical acclaim this project has
received elsewhere, it’s a pretty
safe predication that War will
be considered among the finest
LP’s of 1983.

Pro’s & Con’s of coeducation

If women were to be enrolled
would they have parietals? Cer-
tainly in the interest of fairness
and non-discrimination men
would then be forced to live
under a set of university
established parietals. I believe
that the current system of
regulations in which the only
expectation of the university is
that of gentlemanly conduct is
the best. The freedom that the
university grants its students is
a compliment to and a vote of
confidence in the student body
and is, in my opinion, one of the
most distinctive features of this
institution.

I submit that dedication to the
two principles of the pursuit of
an optimum academic environ-
ment and insurance of student
should be the

 

guidelines by which these deci-
sions must be made. Wash-
ington and Lee is not just its
traditions nor its fraternities.
These are secondary to the in-
stitutional philosophy which in-
dicates a dedication to ‘the
development of man’s capacity
and desire to learn” and ‘a
climate of learning that
stresses the importance of the
individual (and) his personal
honor and integrity...’ Our
freedoms are testimony to. the
existence of such a climate. Let
us not then let our concern over
the efforts of our decisions on
particular issues prevent us
from making those decisions
most consistent to our declared
philosophy.
Respectfully submitted,
Jeffrey P. Blount ’85

Wilson to be inaugurated next Thursday

The last time a man named
Wilson was inaugurated as
president of Washington and
Lee University, the inaugural
ceremony lasted three hours
and featured six different
speeches.

Rest assured that was at least
two hours longer and four
speakers more than will be the
case on May 19 when John D.
Wilson is formally installed as
the 2ist president of Wash-
ington and Lee.

In the 234-year history of
Washington and Lee, the

run the gamut — from quite
brief to rather lengthy and from
simple informality to great
pomp and circumstance.

The inauguration of Gen.
Robert E. Lee as Washington
and Lee University’s eighth
president in 1865 was short and
simple, little more than an oath-
taking with witnesses.

By contrast the inauguration
in 1897 of W&L’s first President
Wilson — William Lyne Wilson
— was both the longest and the
most verbose in the university’s
history.

This month’s inauguration of
John D. Wilson will land
somewhere between those two
extremes, leaning far more
toward the simplicity of the Lee
ceremony but still incor-
porating a few elements that
were missing when the General
took office.

Wilson’s inauguration will be
held at 3 p.m. on the lawn in
front of Lee Chapel. James M.
Ballengee of Philadelphia, Pa.,
rector of the board of trustees,
will preside and will administer
the oath of office to Wilson.

Thomas A. Bartlett, chancellor
of the University of Alabama
System, will deliver the in-
augural address and Wilson will
give a response.

The public is invited to attend
the ceremony.

When Gen. Lee’s inaugura-
tion was being planned, several
of the trustees of what was then
Washington College planned an
elaborate proceeding to which
guests from all over the country
would be invited. Lee, however,
refused to go along with those
plans.

That episode in the universi-
ty’s history is chronicled in the
book ‘‘General Lee’s College”’
by the late Ollinger Crenshaw,
who wrote:

“It had been proposed to
stage President Lee’s inaugura-
tion at the College chapel, to ex-
tend invitations throughout the
nation, to provide a brass band,
and to have ‘young girls robed
in white, and bearing chaplets

press wish of Gen. Lee the exer-
crses were planned as the acme
of simplicity, ‘An exact and bar-
ren compliance with the re-
quired formula of taking the
oath by the new President, and
nothing more...’ ”’

The General had his way. On
Oct. 2, 1965, the college trustees,
faculty, students, clergymen of
Lexington, a magistrate, and
the county clerk gathered in a
recitation room. General Lee
signed the oath and was
presented the keys to the Col-
lege and that was that.

The inaugurations of Fred C.

Cole in 1960 and Robert E.R.
Huntley in 1968 were both in the
middle ground between the
simplicity of the Lees’ and the
pomp of William Wilson’s.

This month’s inauguration of
John D. Wilson will no doubt.
follow the recent pattern of a
happy medium between the ex-
tremes. There will not be six
speakers as was the case at
William Wilson’s inauguration.
But the ceremony will consist of
more than simply handing the
keys to the college to John
Wilson. Besides, he’s had a set
of keys since January.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 13, 1983, Page 5

Blacks feel separated from mainstream

(continued from page 1)
never become involved in stu-
dent activities.

‘‘W&L makes you really con-
scious that you are black; you
feel others saying, ‘He is black
first.’ But I’m a W&L man, no

different from any other.”

All W&L_ students feel
pressures; academic, social
and otherwise.

But add to those pressures
feelings of being rejected,
isolated and unwanted; it can
sap your confidence until you
begin to doubt yourself.

‘“*You’re looking at people
who were accepted at Cornell,
Princeton. We are not inferior
people, but we are treated as
such,’’ said Ron Magee, a junior
from Dallas, Texas. ‘‘Minority
students come here and start
doubting their own abilities for
the first 12-18 weeks. You have
to be extremely confident. You
can’t excel in a hostile environ-
ment.’’

Most black students agree
that they feel separated from
the majority on campus, a
separation caused at times by
racist tendencies on the part of
the white community, both
direct and indirect, and at times
by a misunderstanding and an
inability to deal effectively with
blacks.

RACIAL TENSIONS

Although many of W&L’s
blacks attended mostly white
high schools, they were surpris-
ed by the attitudes they en-
countered here.

It is a very subtle form of pre-
judice, one that is hard to put
your finger on, but very easy to
sense. ‘Racism exists at all
levels, but it’s low-key,” said
Terry McWhorter, a sophomore
from Cleveland, Ohio. ‘‘But it
can still be as powerful and
vivid. It’s definitely there.”’

“Just read any bathroom
wall,” added Wesley Payne a
sophomore from Baltimore,
Md.

Stephen said he felt racial
tensions immediately when no
one would speak to him during
freshman orientation at
Natural Bridge.

And the problem is pervasive.

“In a classroom when you
speak, the guys look at you like,
‘He can speak?’”’ said Ira
Puryear, a junior from Newark,
N.J.

Even professors, perhaps un-
wittingly, add to the pressures.
‘Blacks tend to be compared to
each other in class. You hear
the professor asking, ‘Why
can’t you do as well as other
blacks?’ ’’ Puryear said.

‘‘We don’t feel we are receiv-
ed well enough (by the faculty).
We don’t have the student-
professor relationship that
W&L prides itself on,’’ Magee
said.

In social life, no black is a
fraternity member and general-
ly does not feel welcome at par-
ties. “You get the feeling that

you’re not wanted even as a
visitor,” said Bryan Johnson, a
sophomore from Jersey City,
N.J.

Furthermore there are no
blacks on any of the major cam-
pus organizations: the Ex-
ecutive Committee, the Student
Activities Board, Contact or the
Ring-tum Phi.

Once again, blacks students
perceive that they are not
wanted and so do not even try to
join.

Being a part of such a small
and conspicuous minority, the
black student needs a big slice
of confidence to break the color

barrier. But he wants some en-

couragement.
“*You feel like an outcast. You

hollered, ‘‘Niggers go home,”
as a black student and his
mother were loading their car
to go home.

Then there are what the
blacks call ‘“‘Good Ole Dixie’
parties where fraternities hold
mock lynchings and wear black
face.

But always it is a behind-the-
back sort of racism. “‘It’s very
subtle,’’ said Magee. “But at
times the subtleness is easily
seen.”’

‘‘How does the joke go?’’ ask-
ed Puryear. ‘“‘ ‘When is a nigger
a nigger? When he leaves the
room.’ ”’

MISUNDERSTANDING

Another part of the problem is

a lack of understanding bet-

The black community at W&L
is not large enough, strong
enough or unified enough to
force recognition. The tenden-
cy, therefore has been to
tolerate rather than accept
their presence on campus.

“Whites don’t have to unders-
tand us,” Johnson said. ‘‘But we
have to adjust to them.”’

As a result black students
have to prove continually that
they belong at W&L.

“In order to be respected, you
have to be an overachiever; you
have to accomplish so much
more than the average stu-
dent,’’ Magee said. ‘‘It makes
guys here more tense toward
their relationships with the ma-
jority, and it drives some guys

‘W&L makes you really conscious that

you are black... But ’m a W&L man,
no different from any other’

 

feel like you’re not wanted. The
depressing part is trying to suc-
ceed. The hardships, the
troubles...You don’t need that
problem. At the same time,
white students are not urging us
to get involved at all,” said
McWhorter. ‘‘Nobody’s  stop-
ping the blacks from getting in-
volved; but it’s going to have to
be an individual effort.’
McWhorter said he gave
thought to the SAB and the EC
but lacked the confidence to try.

Feelings of isolation and
alienation are reinforced when
the racism takes a more direct
form.

Most of the blacks at W&L
have been yelled at from pass-
ing cars and dorm windows.
Magee recalled one incident in
which someone in the dorm

ipeceeaeececereeee eee RRR
: ATTENTION

PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS:

ween the white and black com-
munities.

For one reason or another,
many whites carry a false im-
age of blacks to W&L. “A lot of
white students who are not used
to blacks bring stereotypes with
them,” Stephen said. “They
don’t realize that blacks have
the same interests and aspira-
tions. Once they realize it, they
will understand better.”’

Stephen recalled being shock-
ed in a sociology class one day
when a white student remarked
that the problem with blacks is
that they don’t have fathers

around the house.

Beczuse white students do not
understand their black counter-
parts, it is often easier to ignore
them than to deal with them in
any meaningful way.

In Magee’s freshman class in
1980, a record 15 blacks entered
W&L, a group of black students
ranging from National Merit
Scholars to class valedic-
torians. Now eight of them are
left.

“The attrition rate is due to
not being able to handle the in-
tricate pressures of W&L,”’ he
said. ;

between the races is com- —

munication and interaction. At
the very least, blacks and
whites can begin to understand
one another.

“It’s the most you can ask
for,’’ Puryear said. ‘“You can’t
make people change their at-
titudes, but communication can
help.”’

To accomplish that, blacks
and whites need to work
together in campus organiza-
tions they say. ‘‘We need to
have a common ground, a place
to meet, events, etc.,’’ Stephen
said.

“I haven’t seen any function
where blacks and whites have
come together,” McWhorter
said. ‘It would be an advantage
to the entire student body to do
something like that.”’

The white students have their
Fancy Dress Ball while the
blacks hold their own black tie
affair in the annual Student
Association for Black Unity
(SABU) Ball.

This year, SABU sent letters
to every fraternity, every law
student’s carrel and every
freshman in an attempt to make
it a school-wide function. About
600 people came; seven of them
were white.

“There is not enough inter-
change between blacks and
whites,”’ said John White, direc-
tor of minority affairs at W&L.
“The potential exists for a
meaningful coalition; but I
think it’s a lot easier not to do
that. We are comforable in the
small groups we get into and
that works both ways...It’s go-
ing to take some pretty brave
students to bridge that gap.”’

Cramming causes negative feelings, inefficiency

College students who attempt

to cram a semester’s worth of
study into a frantic all-nighter
in order to prepare for an exam
are liable to wind up disliking
the subject they are studying.
‘ That, at least, represents part
of the findings of a series of ex-
periments conducted recently
by a Washington and Lee
University psychology _ pro-
fessor and two former W&L
students.

David G. Elmes, professor of
psychology at W&L, directed
the experiments with Craig J.

Haddonfield, N.J. Their fin-
dings are reported in an article
entitled “What is the role of af-
fect in the spacing effect?”
which appears in a recent issue
of ‘Memory & Cognition.”

The article reports on a series
of experiments that explored
the negative affective feelings
that accompany certain types

of memorization tasks.
In their experiments, the
W&L team used laboratory pro-

cedures to mimic ‘‘cramming”’
and found that the student
memorizers in the tests had

both poorer retention and more

costs of one evening meal at
their fraternity houses. Addi-
tionally, students and faculty
can give money toward World
Hunger in containers around
campus and in fraternity
houses. The Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship, sponsors
of the week-long observance,
plan to give all proceeds to a
world-hunger organization.

negative feelings toward the
material than in more efficient
memorization strategies.

‘‘Most of the people in our ex-
periments found the cramming
situation, in which they were
bombarded with words to
remember at short intervals,
was very distasteful. Moreover,

they also found the material
they were cramming was
distasteful,’’ explains Elmes.
“It is generally accepted that
retention is not nearly as good
in a cramming situation as it is
when the material is spaced
more widely over time. What
may also happen is that in addi-

tion to lack of long-term reten-
tion from such cramming ses-
sions, students may wind up
disliking the material they are
attempting to learn.”’

On the other hand, Elmes and
his colleagues have found that
there are some situations under
which effective memorization
can result from cramming.

‘When the subjects are put
under stress, relating to time or
some other pressure, our data
show that the cramming
method can be somewhat effec-
tive,” said Elmes. ‘‘But it is still
never as effective as dis-
tributing the learning over
time.”

Faculty meetings

(continued from page 1)

ed by colleagues, journals, and
other institutions (on matters
pertaining to current trends in
education). How can a student
know which is better, the bi-
semester or the tri-semester?
The faculty has experience in
these matters.”

While he reserves few
positive words for students and
their self-proclaimed right to
participate in certain decisions,
Coulling is quick to point out
that students who believe the
faculty moves with any great
speed (and thus lack of con-
sideration of student opinions)
are mistaken. He noted the
year’s space between his com-
mittee’s proposal and its subse-
quent adoption.

“The faculty moves with a
good deal of slowness and
deliberateness. There are facul-
ty who express the same objec-
tions as do students. Some

faculty members closely mirror
student views,’’ continued
Coulling. ‘‘The faculty does not
want to alienate students and
seeks no confrontation with
students. But there is a lack of
continuity in the student body
versus the faculty (to warrant
change in the present decision-
making structure).”’

Dean Lewis John agrees with
Coulling on this point.

‘“‘Anyone who thinks the facul-
ty has any degree of unanimity
underestimates the faculty,”
John stated.

What is the value of a student
opinion? At a school the size of
W&L, students have far greater
opportunities to talk with pro-
fessors and _ give opinions.
Presumably, this close relation-
ship allows for greater faculty
awareness of student concerns,
or at least should allow for
greater awareness.

The researchers’ advice to
students confronted with too
much to learn in too short a
time span?

“If you’ve got to cram, then
go ahead and cram,’ said
Elmes. “It may work in the
short run, but over the long
term the retention will not be as
good and your feelings for the
subject matter may be quite
negative.”

The participation of Dye and
Herdelin in Elmes’ ongoing
research on human memory
was supported at Washington
and Lee by Robert E. Lee
Research Grants.

The curriculum situation
stands as an example of student
failure to contribute to a faculty
decision despite an invitation to
do so. Using this case as war-
ranting opening faculty
meetings for airing student
opinions is fighting the wrong
foe. Student apathy cannot heal
itself by opening faculty
meetings. Opening the final
forum of debate will attract no
new interest, no new revela-
tions, no greater control of deci-
sions.

Just as the Board of Trustees
has entrusted to the Executive
Committee (to the students)
certain responsibilities (name-
ly, the honor system), so the
Board, and the administration,
expects certain standards from
the faculty, standards which
are best upheld by open and
uninhibited debate among peers
in a faculty meeting. Without
students or the press present.

Baseball

Murdock pleased

despite record

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and _ Lee’s
baseball team ended its season
with a tie against Newport
News Apprentice and a
doubleheader split against
Christopher Newport College to
finish with a 9-14-2 record.

“Overall we’ve made some
positive strides,’ W&L Coach
Jim Murdock said regarding
this year’s team. Murdock cited
an increased batting average,
better pitching performances,
improved defense and a much
improved team attitude as
positive aspects of the team’s
performance. :

Last Wednesday at Newport
News the Generals fought to a
10-10 tie before the game was
called by the umpires in the
eighth inning.

Freshman Hugh Finkelstein
led the Generals attack with

three hits. Senior Chris
Cavalline had two hits and
junior Kevin Golden had two
hits and three runs-batted-in.

In the first game of the
doubleheader against Chris-
topher Newport Saturday the
Generals exploded for 12 hits to
defeat the Captains 14-0.

Freshman pitcher Kirk Breen
yielded only three hits and one
walk while pitching a complete
game. The win upped Breen’s
record to 3-2 on the season.

In the second game
Christopher Newport scored
seven unearned runs in the fifth
inning to defeat the Generals
10-6.

Sophomore pitcher Billy
White took the loss for the
Generals to drop his record to
5-2 for the season.

Cavalline ended his W&L
career by ripping seven hits in

ports

English gets NCAA bid

Frank English, a Washington
and Lee University senior from
Philadelphia, Pa., has received
an at-large berth in the NCAA
Division III Golf Champion-
ships. The four-day, 72-hole
tournament will take place
Tuesday through Friday, May
17-20 at the College of Wooster
near Akron, Ohio.

English will join 119 players
at the event, to be held on the
6400-yard, par-72 Wooster Coun-
try Club course, site of the 1978
Division III tournament.

He is the third W&L player to
receive the at-large berth in the
Championships’ nine-year
history. Jerry Maatman of
Wilmette, Ill. competed in 1978,
placing third and firing the
event’s low round, a 69. Gerry
Barousse of New Orleans, La.,
participated in 1979, finishing
48th ina field of 120 golfers.

W&L has twice sent a entire
team: 1977, when the Generals
placed seventh, and 1979 when
they finished 11th.

English, a Spanish major who
earned his first varsity golf let-
ter this spring, posted the
team’s low average, a 78 on 624
strokes in eight rounds of play.
At the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championships on
April 25-26 he carded a 155 score
(on rounds of 80 and then 75)
good for fifth place and an All-
Conference citation. His
season’s low round was a 73 on
March 23 at the par-71 Lex-
ington Country Club.

W&L compiled a 60 dual
match record this spring — the
team’s third straight perfect
mark — and won the conference
title, its third in the league’s
seven-year history.

Frank is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Frank English III. He is a
1979 graduate of Springfield
High School in Philadelphia.

 

Senior Frank English chips to within inches of the cup to salvage
par in the ODAC tournament; his consistent play throughout the
year has earned him a spot in the NCAA Division III Champion-
ships to be held next week in Akron, Ohio. (Phi photo by Ken Ries)

doubleheader and Golden added

another three hits to the=

Generals’ offense.

“In the last five games we
batted .342,” Murdock said.
‘‘We left alot of runners on base.
We had the opportunity to win
every game,” he said.

“It would have been nice to
finish at .500 but I’m not totally
disappointed,’ Murdock said.

Outfielder Chris Cavalline
was named first team All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
Cavalline batted .407 this year
and led the Generals in hits,
runs scored and RBIs.

Senior shortstop Jody Harris,
senior outfielder Jim Daly and
pitcher Billy White were named
second team All-ODAC.

Daly batted .297 and Harris
hit .256 and led the Generals
with 15 stolen bases.

Hugh Finkelstein and Kevin
Golden also had good years of-
fensively for W&L. Finkelstein
batted .426 despite injury pro-
blems, and Golden batted .337
and drove in 22 runs.

White led W&L with 3.86 earn-
ed run average and a 5-2 record.

White also had the Generals’
lowest earned run average in
his freshman year.

Senior Jim Stanley compiled
a 5.93 earned run average and a
1-2 record, and Kirk Breen was
3-2 with a 6.75 ERA.

Harris, Cavalline, Daly,
Stanley, pitcher Marty Thomas
and pitcher Pat Jordan will be
lost to graduation.

‘They really helped us a lot,”
Murdock said of the seniors.
“They helped to develop team
spirit and team morale,” Mur-
dock stated.

Murdock said that six
starters from this year’s team
and the team’s two best pit-
chers would be returning next
year though.

“We should be in good
shape,” Murdock said regar-
ding next year’s team. “The in-
coming recruits look good. We
should have five or six pitchers
coming in,’’ stated Murdock.

Murdock also said that he ex-
pected this year’s freshman
class to make some important
contributions next year.

‘ A victory by the Generals, 5-6,

would give the program its thir-

“That (being the last game) ~

A 13-7 defeat. of Hampden-

day gave W&L a chance to
salvage a .500 record. The
Generals were able to dominate
the Tigers mainly by containing

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity tennis standouts Craig Can-
non and Steve Denny have
received bids to compete at the
ninth annual NCAA Division III
Championships. Play began
yesterday and will continue
through Sunday at the State
University of New York in
Albany.

Cannon, a junior from Ocala,
Fla., and Denny, a senior from
Bethesda, Md., will play in the
64-entry singles’ bracket and in
the 32-team doubles’ competi-
tion. It will be their first NCAA
appearance.

The pair posted a 13-10
doubles’ mark this spring and
won the flight-one title in the

- Qld Dominion Athletic Con-

ference Championships on April
30. Denny compiled a 14-10
singles record which featured
the flight-two crown at the con-
ference event while Cannon
finished 8-16 and third in flight-
one singles at the ODAC tourna-
ment.

W&L posted a 7-14 dual match
mark this spring and won the

Said Emmer, ‘‘We lost our in-
tensity and they kept playing
pretty hard.”” Hampden-Sydney
outscored the Generals 6-4 in
the last two quarters.

Will McNeely gave H-S its on-
ly lead, 1-0, but sophomore Rod

Time Out....

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

.... You know it’s getting pret-
ty bad when you pick up the
sports page and see that half the
stories deal with this athlete
suspected of alcohol and/or
drug abuse, this other guy who

can’t pitch because he claims -

he’s got an alcohol problem,
and this league’s investigation
into its alleged drug and alcohol

problems. There have been co- °

caine problems in the NBA and
the NFL. There have been high-
lighted individual cases of drug
and alcohol abuse (see Allen,
Neil; Thompson, David; and
Porter; Darrell). And we’ve
had federal investigations of
various athletes involved in
dealings (see Gerulaitis, Vitas).
It all causes me to wonder why
we have a sports page at all. We
can put the scores in a little box
underneath the weather and put
the really important drug bust
stories on the front page.
Whatever happened to the
athlete who had a little concern
for his public image, other than

how many digits there are in his

salary? But wait, Mike, how
about all the stress they’re
under? Almost as much stress
as the unemployed husband and
father of three, right? Sure.
What’s next? Team drug
counselors? It’s getting so that
rehabilitation .doesn’t have
anything to do with knee in-
juries anymore. The athlete has
such an important role and it
seems that some of today’s
athletes don’t recognize their
responsibility to present a
reputable character. Unfor-
tunately, it’s the bad examples
who get noticed. It’s a shame
we never here of those good ex-

’ amples. But then again, maybe

there aren’t any....

....The World Cup controver-
sy is starting to sound a little
curious. Both the U.S. and
Canada, who have never been
host to the world soccer cham-
pionships, will apparently be
denied in their applications for
host site in favor of 1970 host
site Mexico. It’s sad because
the popularity of soccer was
beginning to grow here and it
would seem the people in
charge of choosing the 1986 site
(the executive committee of
FIFA) would do something to
promote the sport. But then I
guess politics is as much a part
of the game as the athletes
are....

....1 had to get some doctor
from Stonewall Jackson to
revive our friend, the Jersey
prophet, when Sunny’s Halo
came in on Saturday afternoon.
Plaudits are deserved for our
own member of the Royal
Family, but I guess the dart
board’s got to be right some
time. Oh, by the way two weeks
ago he said, ‘‘Watch Chicago.”’
Last week it was, ‘‘Watch Ed-
monton.’’ Now says the Prince,
“This week I’ll be watching
‘Hogan’s Heroes.’ I’ve had
enough.’’ Words to live by, if
there ever were....

.... Think about this during the
weekend: From Sunday May 1
to Sunday May 8, John
McEnroe made $250,000. During
that time he only ‘‘worked”’
about ten hours....
