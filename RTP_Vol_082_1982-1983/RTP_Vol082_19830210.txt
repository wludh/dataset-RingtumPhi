EC urges defeat of
drinking age bill -

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

When Washington and Lee
talks, the Virginia Senate
listens.

At least that is what the Ex-
ecutive Committee was hoping
when they voted Monday night
to send a telegram to Lieute-
nant Governor Dick Davis urg-
ing defeat of the bill to raise the
drinking age for beer to 21.

The EC also recognized an
Ultimate Frisbee team allotting
it $185 and heard budget reports
from the Emergency Loan
Committee and the Ring-tum
Phi.

Morgan Griffith, vice-
president, suggested the
telegram after president Ben-
nett Ross informed the commit-
tee of the proposed bill. The
measure would raise the legal
age for consumption of beer,
both on- and off-premises, to 21.
It passed the House of
Delegates 71-27 last week.

Most of the discussion

centered around the possibility
of having the W&L campus
designated a closed environ-
ment, similar to a military
base. If that were the case,

students under 21 could drink
beer at the Cockpit or at SAB-
sponsored events.

However, that loophole may
not be included in the final ver-
sion of the bill, which the Senate
was expected to vote on this
week,

First-year law representative
John Sicilian was the only
member to vote against the
telegram on the grounds that it
is ‘‘a waste of money that is not
going to do any good.”

The Ultimate Frisbee team is
being organized by senior Chris
Stokes and freshman David
Thompson. The two presented a
petition and a proposed $320
budget.

Following the precedent set
by the Rugby Club and the
Fencing Club, the EC
eliminated $135 designated for
jerseys and said members
should provide their own.

The money allocated by the
EC will provide for 15 frisbees,
a membership in the Ultimate
Players Frisbee Association,
phone calls and a trip by
Thompson to a_ regional
organizational meeting in
Philadelphia. A schedule of
local tournaments will be deter-

se

mined at that meeting.

Senior Frank Eppes, chair-
man of the Emergency Loan
Committee, said that six loans
were still outstanding from last
year and seven from this year.

In addition, he recommended
the committee be restructured
to better meet the needs of
students. The EC decided to
look into a possible reorganiza-
tion.

Steve Perry, business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi
said the newspaper had over
$7,000 on hand. Also, he is going
to begin mailing the papers in
envelopes to subscribers.

In other action:

Sophomore Chris Williams
was appointed Voting Regula-
tions Board Chairman.

A forum for candidates for
president, vice president and
secretary of the EC will be held
on Tues., Feb. 22, in the Com-
merce School.

~The Mock Convention and
Student Association for Black
Unity were reprimanded for not
presenting budget reports. A
motion to freeze Mock Conven-
tion’s funds failed. SABU’s
funds have been frozen for four
weeks.

Jenks reviews 36-year career

By MIKE SHELTON
Special to the Phi

Retiring Professor William A.
Jenks, chairman of Washington
and Lee’s history department,
cheered the Washington Red-
skins in Super Bow] XVII.

Dr. Jenks’ favorite team,
however, is the New York Jets.
“Walt Michaels was one of my
best students,’’ he said.

His 36-year teaching career
will conclude at the end of the
’82-’83 academic year. During
his tenure, Jenks has taught
such notables as Tom Wolfe,
Roger Mudd and former U.S.
Senator and Republican Party
National Chairman Bill Brook.

The professor himself gradu-
ated magna cum laude, Phi
Beta Kappa from W&L in 1939,
and was a member of the Sigma
Nu social fraternity. ‘Mc-
Crums’ drugstore was a
favorite hangout,’’ he

remembers. ‘‘It had a marvel-
ous soda fountain and a dining
room upstairs.”’

Jenks was one of the first
students at Washington and Lee
encouraged to follow a career in
European history, and enrolled
as a graduate student at Colum-
bia University, where he earned
his Masters’ degree in 1940, and
his Ph.D. in 1949,

In 1946 Jenks returned to
Washington and Lee as an in-
structor, after three and a half
years in the Army’s office of
Strategic Services, the precur-
sor to the C.I.A.

Elevated to department head
in 1970, in 1971 he he became the
university’s first William R.
Kenan, Jr. Professor of History.

Jenks is certainly the
“‘scholar-teacher of distinction’
that the Kenan Trust looked for.
An expert in Austrian history,
he has authored four books on
the subject, including The

Austrian Electoral Reform of
1907, Vienna and the Young
Hitler, Austria under the Iron
Ring, 1879-1893, and, most
recently, Francis Joseph and the
Italiana, 1978.

His student proteges in the
realm of history include Henry
Ashby Turner of Yale, Robert
Owen Paxton of Columbia, and
David Bien of the University of
Michigan, all former depart-
ment heads.

He has taught courses rang-
ing from the Renaissance to
Islamic history to imperial and
Soviet Russia. When asked his

favorite, Jenks replied,
“probably the imperial Russion
history course.”

Regarding the Andropov era,
Jenks predicted ‘“‘the period will
be much like the 70s under
Brezhnev — conservative. I
suspect they’re looking for a
way out of Afghanistan. That is

Student body
elections

To the Editor:

Due to a change in the Law
School calendar, elections for
President, Vice President, and
Secretary of the Student Body
will occur one week earlier than
as dictated by the Constitution
of the Student Body. The actual
election day will be Monday,
Feb. 28, 1983 with the run-off, if
necessary, scheduled for Thurs-
day, March 3. Petitions with 150
signatures will be due by 4 p.m.
on Tuesday, Feb. 22, and are re-
quired for a student’s name to
be placed on the ballot.

To facilitate the voting pro-
cess, an election forum, attend-
ed by all the candidates for Stu-
dent Body officers, will take
place on Tuesday, Feb. 22, at 4

p.m. in Room 221, the Com-
merce School. All candidates
who wish to have their name on
the ballot must bring their peti-
tion to this forum. Candidates
should be prepared to present
their views on the issues that
confront students at Washing-
ton and Lee and be able to
answer questions concerning
these views.

I would encourage all stu-
dents who are concerned and in-
terested in the quality of stu-
dent government to attend this
forum. It will be an excellent
opportunity to ask questions
and to gain a better understand-
ing of the candidates and their
positions.

author of an article published in
the January 1983 issue of ‘‘Com-
parative Political Studies.”’

The title of McCaughrin’s ar-
ticle is ‘Statics and Dynamics

grant from the National Science:
Foundation.

McCaughrin presented a
paper, “‘The Noetics of Political
Change,” at the International
Political Science Association
Congress in Rio de Janiero last
August.

McCaughrin joined the Wash-

Jenk’s students and classes
have given him great enjoy-
ment over the years, and he will
miss both very much. Several
years ago he turned down offers
to move onto the graduate level.
“TI prefer teaching undergradu-
ates,’”’ he says. Grading papers,
however, has become increas-
ingly tedious.

He remembers one particular
faux pas on his part years ago,
when at the beginning of a Rus-
sian history class he called his
students’ attention to the up-

coming ‘‘peasants’ weekend.”
When asked if any ‘‘peasants’’
showed up, Jenks replied ‘yes
—in furs and perfume.”

Retirement in Lexington will
allow him more time to visit his
son and daughter, read, listen to
music (Mozart, Ravel, Debus-
sy, and Stravinsky are his
favorites) and tend to the lawn.
He and his wife are currently
contemplating a trip to Cairo
and Luxor.

One figure from history Jenks
would particularly like to meet
is Greta Garbo. “‘My wife has
run into her twice in New York.
I’ve not had the chance.”’

Perhaps now he will.

For the past several months,
the Computer Committee has
been engaged in a study of word
processing; a study which
ultimately includes considera-
tion of micro-computers. In the
course of this undertaking, a
survey of the faculty and ad-
ministration was taken as well
as a survey of a number of other
educational institutions. The
surveys revealed considerable

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present a series of five
concerts in Texas.

Directed since 1973 by Gordon
P. Spice, associate professor of
music, the 37-member glee club

at the First Presbyterian
Church of Dallas on Feb. 13.
The other concerts will be given
at St. Mark’s School in Dallas
(Feb. 14), St. Luke’s Episcopal
Church in San Antonio (Feb.
15), St. Luke’s Methodist
Church in Houston (Feb. 16),
and St. John’s School in Houston

several resort locations in
Florida and the Bahamas, in-

this service. Micro-computers
remain an important possibility
for this purpose (and for other
educational purposes).

This letter represents an in-

viding recommendations so
that future requests for equip-

Asecond purpose of this letter
is to publicize the fact that word

able for general use, including
students, on the Harris com-

ter quality printer available in
the Computer Center. Next year
the printers at the remote ter-
minal clusters will be updated
to permit upper/lower case
printing — the printer in Parm-
ly Hall already has this
capability. Finally, the Com-
puter Center plans to present an
introductory seminar (to be
repeated periodically) on the
use of the Harris system for
word processing.

EC president Ross comments on W&L

By JOHN HARRISON
‘Phi Staff Writer

As president of the Executive
Committee of the student body
at Washington and Lee, Bennett
Ross controls a 12-man group
that is responsible for the ad-
ministration of the school’s
honor system as well as the
supervision of every aspect of
campus life.

Yet when he took office in
September, Ross said that he
felt his responsibility was to see
that the EC itself operated effi-
ciently as well as effectively.

“At the beginning of the
year,” he said, ‘the biggest
challenge we had was to create
tight internal control of the sub-
committees. There was no re-
serve (funds) for us to dip into,
so we couldn’t tolerate any
wasteful spending.”’

Evaluating the work of the
EC for the first half of the year,
Ross pointed out that through
its subcommittees the EC has
successfully followed through
on suggestions from other
students.

“There have been little, but
important, things that people
have brought to our attention,
like the equipment in the weight
room needing to be fixed,” he
said. “‘We had a subcommittee
look into that and it was even-
tually taken care of. We ap-
pointed another subcommittee
that was successful in getting
the drop/add fee reduced back
to $5.’’ he noted.

Ross has also been pleased
with the Student Activities
Board, the extracurricular ac-
tivities division of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

“They’ve worked hard to
bring us some fine programs,”’

Ross said, adding that the
ultimate factor in determining
the SAB’s performance will be
whether it can prevent the Fan-
cy Dress Ball from being a
financial loss.

Last year the SAB lost about

$25,000 on Fancy Dress, accord-
ing to FD Director John
Haywood.

In the remainder of the year,
Ross said there are at least two
matters the EC will be address-
ing, the foremost being the
university’s official explanation
of the Honor Code and its ad-
ministration, the White Book.

“We've got to complete the
revisions on that and make sure

‘that the people on the EC for

next year will be able to run
things smoothly,’’ he said

Responding to a recent letter
in the Ring-tum Phi which call-
ed for the abolishment of the
Honor Code on the grounds that
college students are not capable
of dispensing justice in honor
trials, Ross said the letter’s
author showed a ‘‘fallacy in
thought. His thoughts were not
coherent. Students must be held
responsible for their actions. If
we (the EC) can handle a large
budget, then we should also be
allowed to handle honor cases.”

Ross added the letter’s com-
ments about the personality of
the president of the Student Bar
Association were unnecessary
and used ‘‘only to get attention”
from the W&L community.

Asked to reflect on ‘the
changes he has seen at W&L in
his four years on campus, Ross
pointed to the SAB.

“One of the best things is that
it has moved outside its regular
realm, the fraternities. It’s

made a real effort to appeal to
independents and law students
and not just the fraternities.
They haven’t gone far enough
(in considering the entire stu-
dent body) but they’ve come a

Bennett Ross

long way, and with the money
they have, it should continue to
improve,

On the retirement of Presi-
dent Huntley and the changes

 

that could follow, Ross conclud-

_ed, ‘‘The school has made a

commitment to serious  stu-
dents. I do not think that will
change under President
Wilson.”’

PAD sponsors seminar

The Phi Alpha Delta law
fraternity at the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law will sponsor a one-day
seminar on family and juvenile
law on Saturday, Feb. 12, in
Lewis Hall.

The seminar will include ses-
sions led by members of the
W&L law school faculty, prac-

ticing lawyers, and other
specialists in the areas of fami-
ly and juvenile law.

For the past two years, Phi
Alpha Delta has conducted a
Juvenile Justice Program in the
Rockbridge County area in
which W&L law students have
taught classes on _ various
aspects of the law to students in

area public schools.

According to Dave Friedfeld,
a third-year W&L law student,
the Family and Juvenile Law
Seminar is an extension of the
Juvenile Justice Program,
which has been extremely suc-
cessful in Rockbridge area
schools.

Cockpit could close if drinking age raised

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

“Devastating.”

“There would be some
serious consequences.”’

Those were the reactions
from Jerry Darrell, Food ser-
vices manager and Dean of
Students Lewis John to a bill
under consideration by the
Virginia General Assembly to
raise the legal drinking age for
beer to 21.

The bill sailed through the
House of Delegates by a 71-27
vote 10 days ago and is expected
to pass the Senate before the
end of the session in mid-
February. Governor Charles
Robb supports the measure.

If adopted, the bill would
become effective July 1, 1983. A
“grandfather clause” would en-
sure that any person who could
legally buy beer on that date

would not be stripped of the
privilege. Currently in Virginia,
one must be 19 to buy beer to
take out and 18 to purchase it
for on-premises consumption.

Darrell indicated that the bill
could spell the end for the
Cockpit. The on-campus tavern
receives 95 percent of its
business from students at night,
but the new law would essential-
ly limit alcohol consumption to
seniors.

In addition, a majority of the
Cockpit’s business comes from
the bands on Tuesday nights.
However, Darrell doubts the
Student Activities Board would
continue to hire bands if beer
were not being sold.

Before deciding to close the
tavern or discontinue its beer
license, Darrell said, “I would
like to get a lot of input from a

lot of different people.”

There are two possible loop-
holes that could save the
Cockpit. The first, an amend-
ment that barely failed in the
House, would raise the on-
premises consumption from 18
to 19. Another would allow on-
premises consumption in closed
environments by people under
21. This would include army
bases and college campuses.

Not only would the Cockpit
lose a majority of its business if
the law were enacted, but, ac-
cording to Dean of Students
Lewis John, ‘‘The provision of
beer at Fancy Dress would be
open to question, and SAB
events would certainly be af-
fected in the way they are car-
ried out.”’

John, who was hoping the bill
that

would not pass, feels

fraternity parties, as private af-
fairs with individual drinking
might not be greatly affected.
However, he said, ‘‘I would hate
to see the Cockpit close or stop
serving beer.”

His opposition to the bill does
not only stem from its implica-
tions at Washington and Lee. “I
don’t think it will accomplish
the purposes that its sponsors
have indicated, if in fact they
are attempting to get at drunk-
en driving,” he said. ‘Stricter
drunken driving laws and
stricter enforcement are better
ways to approach it.”’

Darrell, though, feels other-
wise, “I think it’s good
something is being done,’’ he
said.

Delegate Vance Wilkins, a
Republican who represents
Lexington, affirmed that the in-

crease of automobile accidents
involving intoxicated youths
had an impact on the legisla-
ture’s decision to tackle the
issue. A youth, Wilkins said, ‘‘is
not that good a driver, and that
coupled with beer may have a
pretty measurable effect.’’

However, the measure will
not be a ‘‘cure-all. It’s not going
to keep alcohol out of the hands
of people 18, 19 or 20, but it will
get it out of the hands of 16- and
17-year-olds,”’ Wilkins said.

Wilkins, who voted for the bill
and gives it a ‘‘very good
chance”’ of passing the Senate,
does not feel that it will
eliminate alcohol at colleges
and universities.

After all, he said, “Do you
have to have liquor to have a
good time?”’

Murphy makes‘48 hours’

By TODD JONES
Phi Staff Writer

In his screen debut, 48 Hours,
Saturday Night Live alumnus
Eddie Murphy shows the poten-
tial for a very successful screen
career, although it is unfor-
tunate that he picked this movie
in which to debut. Not to say the
movie doesn’t have its mo-
ments, it does, but they are
almost entirely because of Ed-
die Murphy.

In the film, which stars Mur-
phy and Nick Nolte, a cop
(Nolte) is trying to recover an
escaped convict, and requires
the help of another convict

(Murphy). Nolte once again
plays the tough-guy role which
he used so effectivly in North
Dallas Forty, acting as a straight
man for Murphy. Although his
scenes with Murphy are good,
his scenes with his lover, played
by Annette O’Toole, leave
something to be desired. This is
another in a series of standard
roles for Nolte.

Murphy, however, shows how
a movie can be worthwhile, for
just one performer. Murphy is
hilarious as a sarcastic, wise-
cracking, street-wise burglar.
One spends the entire evening
laughing when he is on and
waiting for him to return when

Harvard law _ professor
Harold J. Berman has been
named scholar-in-residence in
the Frances Lewis Law Center
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law.

Berman will spend the spring
semester at Washington and
Lee’s law school where he will
conduct research on the impact
of the great revolutions in the
West on the ideas of law. In ad-
dition, he will teach a seminar
on law reform.

Berman is the James Barr
Ames Professor of Law at Har-
vard, where he has been teach-
ing since 1948. His courses there
include The Law of Interna-
tional Trade, The Western
Legal Tradition, and Com-
parison of Soviet and American
Law.

He is the author of 19 books
and more than 200 articles and
has written extensively on com-

W&L law

parative law, legal history, and
legal philosophy as well as on
legal problems in international
trade. His books include ‘‘Jus-
tice in the U.S.S.R.”’ (2nd edi-
tion, 1963), ‘‘Soviet Criminal
Law and Procedure’’ (2nd edi-
tion, 1972), and ‘‘The Interac-
tion of Law and Religion’
(1974).

A native of Hartford, Conn.,
Berman received the B.A.
degree from Dartmouth College
in 1938. He studied at the Lon-
don School of Economics and
Political Science in 1938-39 and

at the Yale Graduate School
and Yale Law School. He re-
ceived both the M.A. (1942) and
the LL.B. (1947) from Yale
University. He taught law in
Stanford in 1947-48. He served in
the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945
and is the recipient of the
Bronze Star Medal.

he isn’t. Murphy simply makes
the movie what it is.

The film’s most effective mo-
ment is a foot-chase in China-
town in San Francisco. How-
ever, the film contained an inor-
dinate amount of violence,
which did not add to the movie’s
humor or effectiveness. It pro-
bably would have been better
with fewer bullet-in-the-head
scenes and more Murphy.

The film, which was written
by Walter Hill, Roger Spots-
woode and Larry Gross and
directed by Hill, ought to be
seen, if only for Murphy’s
wonderful performance. How-
ever, don’t expect much more.

The Dark Crystal is an enchant-

straight-forward, hard-rocking
album with enough hooks and
production tricks to make it suf-
ficiently accessable for
American radio. By simply
changing prduction sytles, Def
Leppard has a chance at crack-
ing the American market
without compromising musical
style.

Despite a fanatical British
and European following and a
respectable international
appeal, the Jam has never at-
tracted more than a small
group of fans stateside. This
can be attributed, in part, to the
Jam’s refusal to compromise
their musical integrity, and a
certain lyrical inaccessibility.
The average Journey/Styx
record buyer is neither likely
nor expected to be interested in
lyrics about the current state of

Def Leppard and The Jam rock

England’s society. Despite an
almost criminal state of affairs,
the Jam stuck to their musical
guns until the very end, having
disbanded late last year. Their
last album, Dig The New Breed,
is a live anthology recorded be-
tween 1977-82, which gives a
good representation of the dif-
ferent stages through which the
band evolved. Early recordings
with small audiences show the
band at their frenetic best with
the influences of the past (early
Who) displayed proudly while
still acknowledging London’s
punk present. Later perfor-
mances show the polish and
maturity that made the Jam
one of Britain’s most popular
bands. While still not accessible
enough for stateside radio, the
Jam’s last album more than
lives up to their standards.

The story is about a Gelfling
(a creature which looks like a
human) who is given a shard
from a giant crystal, many
miles away. His job is to merge

this shard with the huge crystal. .

The crystal is guarded by
Skeksis — the masters of evil.
Skeksis are huge, vulture-like
creatures, who are crude, nas-
ty, and humourous.

There are a few drawbacks to
the film; the story, by Henson
and David O’Dell, was not near-
ly as imaginative as the pup-
pets. The plot was too conven-
tional — with all these strange

why play the game according to
human rules? However, the
film is such that it’s very enter-
taining just to sit back and
watch the puppetry and forget
about the plot.

The Dark Crystal is a film to
see. While by no means perfect,
it is enjoyable beginning to end.

O’Kane display in duPont aa »

WEL News Office

An exhibit of paintings by
Virginia artist Tim O’Kane
went on display in duPont
Gallery on the Washington and
Lee University campus on Mon-
day, Jan. 31.

The exhibition will remain on
view through Feb. 25.

Hours for the duPont Gallery
are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays,
11 a.m. to3 p.m. Saturdays, and
2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sundays. Ad-
mission is free.

O’Kane is a native of Rich-
mond and is currently living in
Scottsville. He received the

bachelor of fine arts degree in
painting/printmaking from Vir-
ginia Commonwealth Univer-
sity in 1972.

He has exhibited widely in
Virginia and elsewhere. In 1979,
his work was included in the
Realist Annual: Landscape Ex-
hibition of the Southeastern
Center for Contemporary Art in
Winston-Salem, N.C.

In 1980, he began exhibiting at
Quadrum Gallery in Boston and
received a _ professional fel-
lowship from The Virginia Mu-
seum in Richmond.

He has also received a
Virginia Commission for the
Arts Professional Fellowship
from the Virginia Museum and
has begun exhibiting his work
at the Francis Kyle Gallery in

London. His paintings were in-
cluded in a group invitational
exhibition, ‘“‘Realism,’”’ at the
Southeastern Center for Con-
temporary Art in Winston-
Salem in 1982.

O’Kane’s _ paintings were
featured in “A Tim O’Kane
Portfolio” in the May/June
issue of The Albermarle

Magazine.
Of his painting, O’Kane has
written: “... to me painting is

like making music. It makes me
wander into my feelings about
what I’ve been through in my
relationships, about what I feel
with the overhanging kind of
pressure of impermanence all
the time. It takes me through
—as a dream does — levels of
the subconscious.’

Carter portrait added to

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity received a valuable addi-
tion to its collection of 18th and
19th century American art
when Mrs. Theodore A. Seder of
Lexington presented the univer-
sity with a portrait of Bernard
Moore Carter painted around
1810 by noted artist John
Vanderlyn.

Mrs. Seder made the gift in
memory of her mother, Mary
McCorkle Wilson Morgan, who
was born and raised in Lex-
ington and Collierstown, and in
honor of her brother, William

 

Wilson Morgan, a member of
the Washington and Lee Class
of 1927 and a distinguished
astronomer and professor of
physics with the Yerkes Obser-
vatory of the University of
Chicago.

Mr. and Mrs. Seder moved to
Lexington in December from
San Antonio, Tex.

The Carter portrait is an im-
portant addition to the Washing-
ton and Lee collection not only
because it is the university’s
first work by Vanderlyn but
also because it provides an in-

teresting link with the Custis-
Washington-Lee Collection,
which represents six genera-
tions of the Washington, Custis,
and Lee families.

Bernard Moore Carter’s
sister was the wife of ‘Light
Horse Harry Lee” and the
mother of Robert E. Lee. Carter
was himself the husband of
“Light Horse Harry’ Lee’s
daughter, Lucy.

“This painting has been a
treasure and joy to me for near-
ly 25 years,’’ Mrs. Seder said.
“And now I wish to share it with

fine example of early American

portraiture.”
Vanderlyn was considered
the best portraitist of his day.

“This portrait makes an im-
portant educational addition to
our art history program here at
Washington and Lee,” said
Pamela H. Simpson, associate
professor of art history and
assistant dean of the college at
W&L. ‘‘Aside from the obvious
importance of the connection
between the subject of the
painting and the Lee family, a
painting by John Vanderlyn, an
extremely important American
artist, makes a splendid addi-
tion to our collection.”

According to Mrs. Seder, who
was formerly a research and
art reference librarian, very
few portraits by Vanderlyn
have come on the art market
since most of the artist’s best
work was commissioned by
various government bodies, in-
cluding the U.S. Congress and
the state and city of New York.

in 1780, was the son of Charles

Strong team to work out in Florida

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

With the start of the season
less than three weeks away, it
appears that the Washington
and Lee lacrosse team will be
skilled and deep at the at-
tackman position and in goal. It
is at midfield and defense, ac-
cording to head coach Jack Em-
mer, that the Generals will be
trying to make up for a lack of
overall experience.

“Our attack will have a group
of six solid players that gives us
a good nucleus to work with,”
said Emmer. “Some of them
like to play right around the
goal to get the ball fed to them,”
he noted.

Lee Heimert and Geoff Wood
should be W&L’s biggest scor-
ing threats. Heimert is the
leading scorer among returning

players, while senior Wood
tallied 22 times as a sophomore.

Emmer also is counting on
seniors Mike Lewers and Joe
Seifert, who missed part of last
year with injuries, as well as
Jeff Mason and freshman Caul-
ley Deringer to lead an offense
that lost the top three point
scorers from last season.

One of those players is Rob
Staugaitis, who set up the at-
tack the past two years and
finished his career as_ the
second-leading assist scorer in
school history. The primary
candidate to take over the
directing responsibilities, said
Emmer, is sophomore Rod San-
tomassimo.

A lack of depth and ex-
perience at midfield is the
Generals’ area of greatest con-
cern. ‘Normally you’d like. to
have nine to 12 middies, but we

have only five or six coming
back from last year,” he said.
He added that it isn’t likely any
of last year’s junior varsity,
midfielders will move up.
Co-captains John Tunney, a
solid two-way player, and John
Doub will be the leading mid-
dies. Doub and Barry Water-
man should be the biggest offen-
sive threats at the position, ac-
cording to Emmer. John But-
tarazzi, Kevin Walakovits, Stu
Kiehne, Mark Knobloch and
Sandy Brown also are assured
of spots. Emmer said that
Kiehne, who ran on the same
line last season as second and
third-leading scorers Mike
Schuler and John Sancilio, will
have to pick up some of the
slack created by the loss of

those two players.

On defense, where only five
seniors and juniors return, ex-
perience might be a problem.
However, Emmer said, there
are teams that will vie for the
remaining four spots. ‘‘We want
to wait to see who develops
before we make a decision,”
said the coach.

Seniors Newton Kendrick,
Steve Conboy and Bill Sharp
will be joined by juniors Tim
Schurr and Don Richardson.
Schurr was moved to defense
after he played defensive mid-
die a year ago.

In goal the Generals, led by
junior Phil Aiken, should be
stronger at the start of a season
than they have been for several
years. Said Emmer, ‘‘Aiken has

deal to televise the league’s
opening season and the out-
rageous contracts that USFL
rookies are being offered.
(Kelvin Bryant is expected to
sign for a mere $350,000 a year. )
It isn’t enough to say profes-
sional sports are a business and
big business means big money.
Besides, the USFL isn’t offering
anything new. It’s just the old
spinoff game based on the idea
that more (money, gimmicks,
etc.) is better. And we’ve also
seen what’s happened to those
spinoffs. Remember, if you can,
the ABA, WHA, and WFL.
They’ll be more people follow-
ing the financial conditions than
the football scores. The
scenario’s getting distasteful
and sadly enough the only thing
new about the USFL is that it
has four letters in its abbrevia-
tion instead of three...

...Well, back down to earth
and the Warner Center. Hats off
to General cagers John Lee
Graves and Billy Yates who
lead the ODAC in free throw
percentage. Infact, the team as
a whole sits atop the ODAC in
both free throw percentage and
field goal percentage. Why are
they in fourth place in the con-
ference then, you ask? It comes

  

a lot of confidence from his per-
formance when he started the
last couple of games last year.”
Junior Mark Lukes will pro-
bably be the first backup, with
John DiDuro and Tom Truffer
also challenging Aiken.

Emmer believes that national
champion North Carolina,
runner-up Johns Hopkins and
Virginia should continue their
dominance of _ collegiate
lacrosse, with Cornell and
Maryland moving up strongly
this year.

Over Washington break, the
team will be in southern Florida
to take advantage of the warm
weather for two-a-day work-
outs. Duke University will be at
Wilson Field for the season
opener Wednesday, March 2.

down to the Generals’ ability to
control the game which was
present in December and early
January but seems to be sketch-
y right now. Let’s face it, the
team that controls the game
wins it and recently W&L has
been the controllee rather than
the controller. The beginnings
of a turnaround, though, can be
seen in the victory over Lynch-
burg. They’ve played them-
selves into a hole, but I’d like to
see them find their way out...

...Other news from the center
sees the swimmers and wres-
tlers continuing to improve and
it appears both these squads
have individuals who are poin-
ting toward their respective na-
tional tournaments.... It’s a
shame, however, that these in-
dividuals, along with the
basketball team, aren’t receiv-
ing the fan support their efforts
deserve...

..Finally, I’m sure you’ve
heard of the NCAA’s new ‘‘700”
rule. That’s the one requiring
recipients of athletic scholar-
ships to score a minimum of 700
on the SATs. Wait, don’t laugh
yet. They expect it to work, |
too.... Have a nice break..

Wrestlers finish
home season 7-2

By CHRIS FULTON
Phi Staff Writer

Wrestling at home for the last
time this season the Generals
improved their record to 7-2 and
locked up a winning season in
quadrangular competition
against Furman University, La
Salle College and Campbell Col-
lege.

The Generals routed Furman
56-2 and La Salle 53-3 but came
‘up short- against Campbell
24-18.

Outconditioning and ‘‘mental
toughness,’’ the dividends of a
difficult early schedule, were
the story behind the Generals’
impressive performance Satur-
day, as W&L pinned nine op-
ponents from Furman and
LaSalle. The Generals lost in a
hard-fought struggle with
Campbell; although both teams
posted five victories each, the
Campbell Camels had more
total points and claimed the vic-
tory.

Phi Staff Writer

After losing on the road at
Emory & Henry, the Washing-
ton and Lee basketball team
won its final two Old Dominion
Athletic Conference home
games to raise its ODAC record
to 8-5 and its overall mark to
15-6.

As of Tuesday night, the
Generals 8-5 league mark put
them in fourth place in the
ODAC. Hampden-Sydney and
Maryville were both ahead of
the Generals with 7-4 marks,
and Catholic and Eastern Men-
nonite trailed W&L with 7-6

~ marks.

“They are hanging in there
tough, and I’m very proud of
them,’’ W&L Coach Verne Can-
field said concerning his team’s
performance.

Thursday at Emory & Henry
the Generals led briefly in the
second half, but lost to the
Wasps 61-53.

W&L trailed by six points at
the half, but came back to take
a 40-36 lead with about 13

Campbell, freshman Larry
Anker and junior Tim Valliere
had a day of revenge. Anker
had lost twice to his Camel op-
ponent early in the season by
sizeable margins, but ag-
gressive, quick wrestling and
added experience led him to a
4-2 victory. Valliere posted an
identical score in his win over
his Campbell adversary. Val-
liere wrestled intelligently, shif-
ting his opponent to’the edge of
the mat before trying to shoot
in, and moving to the center
when in control. Again, condi-
tioning appeared to be a factor
in the final period.

W&L crushed Furman 56-2,
with a combination of six pins,
three forfeits, and one tie.
Anker (134), Win Sisson(142),
Tim White (150), Win Phillips
(158), Dave Johnston (177), and
Jeff Dixon (190) all forced their
opponent’s shoulders to. the

Henry regained the lead for
good with three minutes to play,
and held off the Generals by hit-
ting 10 free throws in the final
minutes.

Sophomore Lex Fitzenhagen
led the Generals’ attack with 13
points. Senior Brian Hanson
and junior John Lee Graves
added 12 points each.

W&L continued to play well in
the Warner Center though, as
the Generals trounced Lynch-
burg College 82-66 Saturday
night.

Throughout much of the
game, the Generals employed a
three-guard offense and a delay
game very effectively.

‘“‘We need a change,’’ explain-
ed Canfield concerning the in-
creased use of the three-guard
offense in recent games. ‘‘Some
of the big guys weren’t doing
some of the things we wanted
them todo.”

W&L also used a two platoon
system in the Lynchburg game.

each had pins against La Salle.
It was Nichols’ first collegiate
appearance, and as coach Gary
Franke pointed out, “Now
everyone on the team has had
experience whether they are in
the starting line-up or not.”’
Campbell College was the
real test of the day and W&L

McClatchey, David Wilkinson,
and Scott Shannon. Ten minutes
into the game, Canfield substi-
tuted five new players for the
starters.

‘“‘We just needed something to
relieve the pressure on some of
the kids who weren’t playing
well,” Canfield reported. Can-
field added that the team’s
heavy schedule in addition to
academics have forced him to
make frequent adjustments in
the line-up.

Lynchburg led the Generals
during the opening minutes of
the first half, but W&L took the
lead permanently on a basket
by Hanson that gave W&L a
17-16 lead with 11:33 remaining
in the half. W&L increased its
lead to 37-26 at halftime.

performed admirably, winning
five matches and losing five but
falling short in the overall point
totals. In addition to victories
by Anker and Valliere other
winners were Win Phillips 5-0,
Jeff Dixon 15-1, and Carlton
Peebles 13-2. Coach Franke
summed up the weekend,

opening four minutes of the se-
cond half to take a 48-26 lead.
The Hornets never closed the
deficit to less than 15 points with
the rest of the game.

Hanson and Fitzenhagen
were the only Generals to score
in double figures as the frequent
substitutions kept the scoring
balanced. Hanson tossed in 23
points, and Fitzenhagen hit for
13 points.

Center the Generals never trail-
ed Bridgewater College during
W&L’s 84-75 victory over the
Eagles.

W&L expanded a 44-32 half-
time lead to a 59-42 lead with
about 14 minutes to play in the
game. Bridgewater rallied to
close the gap to seven points on
several occasions, but could
never get any closer than that.

stating ‘It wasn’t a bad after-
noon’s work for us.”’

W&L resumes action this
week with two matches on the
road. Wednesday the team
travels for a match with Lyn-
chburg College, and Saturday
the Generals will wrestle at
Catawba.

Five Generals scored in dou-
ble figures with Hanson leading
the way with 22 points. Frank
Eppes fired in 18 points, Graves
14 points, Wilkinson 14 points,
and Billy Yates 10 points.

W&L concludes its regular
season with a four-game road
trip that begins tonight with a
non-league game at Shenan-
doah College. Over the break,
the Generals will have ODAC
contests at Roanoke, Eastern
Mennonite, and Maryville.

“Certainly the Maryville and
the Eastern Mennonite games
will be critical because we are
competing with them for play-
off position,’’ noted Canfield.

W&L traditionally has a long
road trip scheduled during
February break. “That is some-
thing we have to deal with,”
Canfield noted.
