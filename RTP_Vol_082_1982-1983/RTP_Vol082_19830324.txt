Ehrlichman

Former Senator Eugene Mc-
Carthy contended that presi-
dential administrations have
progressively become more
secretive.

Former Nixon aide John
Ehrlichman countered by sug-
gesting that there might be
more sharing of information by
the executive branch if presi-
dents could depend on confiden-
tiality.

A crowd estimated at 1,300
heard the two men discuss, if
not truly debate, the issues of
First. Amendment rights in
Warner Center on the Washing-
ton and Lee University campus

and McCarthy debate

Thursday (March 17).

The program was the fourth
presentation by Contact ’83, a
speakers’ symposium spon-
sored jointly at W&L by the in-
terfraternity council and_ the
student body.

McCarthy began the program
by suggesting that there ‘‘are
really three questions: one is
the right of the Congress to
know what an administration is
doing, the second is the right of
the public to know, and the third
is the right of the people within
the administration to know
what other people in the ad-
ministration are up to.

‘“Progressively, beginning
even before the Kennedy ad-
ministration, the progressive
thrust has been for the ad-
ministration to take for itself
more and more authority, more
rights to be secretive, more
rights to act without any real
assurance that the Senate or the
Congress knew what they were
up to or that they had actual
public support for the action,’’
added McCarthy, 66, who serv-
ed two terms as a Democratic
Senator from Minnesota and
was a presidential candidate in
1968.

Runoffs today

 

New EC lacks

experience

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

At least nine of next year’s 12
Executive Committee members
will have had no prior EC ex-
perience, depending on the re-
sults of today’s runoff elections.

Current EC members were
not defeated, rather, they chose
not to run for re-election, and as
a result, next year’s committee
will feature a flood of new faces.

The Big 3, elected last month,
will consist of Bob Jenevein,

president; Dave Judge, vice .

president; and Len Howard,
secretary. None has served on
the EC.

Among this year’s members,
only freshman Steve Connett
and sophomore Darby Brower
are running for re-election.

Connett had 13 challengers
for the two sophomore posi-
tions, but he managed to qualify
for today’s run-off with Ken
Lindeman, Gerald Shepherd
and James White.

Brower was joined by Sam
Dalton and former freshman
representative Cole Dawson in
the run-off for the two seats.
Dawson lost his seat to Brower
and Dave Jonson last year.

Todd Barstow, Jim Messer,
Jack O’Brien and George You-
mans qualified for the run-off
for senior representative.

Randy Coffey, David Flet-
cher and Jim Green were run-
ning for the seat of upperclass
law representative, but the law
school ballot boxes had disap-
peared Monday and the votes

could not be counted.

The Calyx and the Rugby
Club both presented budget
reports at Monday’s EC meet-
ing. Phil Murray, editor of the
Calyx, reported a surplus of
$1,184. The yearbooks will be
ready by the last week of
school.

Herb Funsten of the Rugby
Club reported expenditures to
date of $451. He said the team
has 27 members, including four
law students, but lost its first
match to Roanoke March 12 by
a 24-6 count.

Two freshman class officers,
Townes Pressler and Steve
Best, responded to questions
from the EC regarding the ad-
mission of students to the grain
party on Saturday of Fancy
Dress weekend.

Students were given a ticket

their Fancy Dress Ticket,
regardless of whether they had
bought a Class Pass.

“The ABC would not let us
collect money at the door,”’ ex-
plained Pressler.

However, several committee
members suggested checking
for Class Passes at the time of
the purchase of FD tickets. If a
student does not have one, he
could be charged separately for
the grain party.

The EC also announced that it
will appoint a new chairman for
the Student Telephone Union on
April 19, and that nominations
for the Dean Gilliam Award
(student) and the Pusey Award
(faculty member) are due that
evening.

Letter called ‘pompous’

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to
Katherine Settle’s letter to the
Editor which ran in the March
17 issue of the ‘‘Ring-tum Phi.”’
Settle asked if it was necessary
to print the article “Sophomore
charged with the possession of
cocaine” in the March 10 issue
of the ‘‘Phi.’’ She wrote, ‘‘The
responsibility to report school
news lies with this publication.”’
The individual mentioned in the
article is a student of this
university and therefore a part
of it. As I see it, it is the purpose
of the ‘‘Ring-tum Phi” to report
events concerning all parts of
Washington and Lee; hence, the
' article was quite essential. That
the individual was done an in-
justice, I really doubt. The inci-
dent is a matter of public
record.

I do not believe for one minute
that the ‘“Ring-tum Phi’’
overstepped its journalistic
boundaries, as Settle suggested.
The issue of drug abuse is a
relevant and important one.
Settle said that there are
students ‘‘who do not need or
wish to know’ about the
reported drug incident. That is
a pompous statement which
denies reality. Of course drug
abuse is not rampant on this
campus, but it does exist and
needs to be faced by informed
students and faculty. Settle urg-
ed this newspaper to consider

how the March 10 article would
affect students, faculty, and
alumni. The truth is that these
people do not live under rocks
and are not unaware of the facts
about drugs. If they are una-
ware, it is the obligation of the
“Ring-tum Phi” to make the
facts known to them.

President Wilson did indeed
say that our student body is a
cumulative ‘‘genius.’’ There is
inherent in that statement a
challenge — the challenge of
maintaining that genius. Self-
improvement never comes
about without introspection.
Settle writes that the article
“not only informed us, but
harmed us.”’ This is nonsense.
We will not achieve that self-im-
provement at all if our school
paper chooses to ignore the
facts and print only pleasant
material.

Finally Dean John, in ap-
proval of this paper’s reporting,
urged the ‘‘Ring-tum Phi’’ to
print the university policy state-
ment on drugs, and it appeared
— appropriately enough
—above Settle’s letter. I agree
with Settle on one point: we all,
in fact, do want a school paper
of which we can be proud. The
“‘Ring-tum Phi’s’’ treatment of
this drug issue warrants that
pride.

Sincerely,
Warren T. Taylor

Settle letter misinterpreted role of the media

To the Editor,

It is obvious from Miss Set-
tle’s letter to the Phi (March 17)
that she does not understand the
function of the media in our
society.

The First Amendment guar-
antees freedom of the press. In
exchange, the media have a
responsibility to keep the people
informed of what goes on in the
world around them.

This is a heavy responsibility,
for editors must decide what is

news and what is not. Editors
have to make this judgement
while keeping in mind that in-
formation reported by the
media is required by the people
to make the responsible deci-
sions needed to maintain a
democratic society.

The media have another
responsibilities — to set to the
agenda topics for local and na-
tional consideration. If the
media were lax in this function,
citizens would remain ignorant

 

Notes
Library books due April 2

Mrs. Linton at the University
Library would like to remind
students that April 2 is the
Winter Term due date. All
books stamped with a due date
of April 2. or earlier are due
then.

Please renew any books that
you want to keep beyond that
date. Books can be renewed by
bringing a list of the call
numbers to the Circulation

Desk or by simply calling the
library.

Students are also reminded
that all study carrels are
cleared at the end of each term.
Please remove all materials
from your carrel by 6 p.m., Fri-
day, April 8. You may use the
book cases in the Smoking
Lounges to put your materials
on until Spring Term classes
begin.

Calyx to Cadavers

Dear Cadaver Society,

Your organization owes the ‘‘Calyx’’ $200 for its page in last
year’s yearbook. If you wish to be included this year, please send
the ‘‘Calyx”’ a check for $400 before Spring break.

 

Sincerely,

of issues which require action.
This is not to say that the media
decide where the people must
focus their attention; rather
their role is to report a story,
leaving it to the people to react
to or ignore it.

Miss Settle, in saying that
there are those “‘who do not
need or wish to know” about the
story which appeared in the Phi
concerning the W&L student
charged with possession of co-
caine, shows contempt for the
principles upon which First
Amendment guarantees are
based. To ignore events or to
wish they would just go away
would effect a society both mute
and deaf to signs of change or
unrest.

By printing the story, the Phi
showed that W&L has a news-
paper which does the student
body a service far beyond that
of being a mere outlet for of-
ficial News Office bulletins, as
it has been in recent years. If
nothing else, the story is a
reminder that W&L students
are held to the same laws as the
rest of society. Whether to abide
by the law is the individual’s
choice.

Miss Settle also said that “‘in-
justice (has been) done to the
subject of the article.” Is it an
injustice to print the facts of a
case which are available to
anyone on demand at the local

police station? Why should this
story be withheld while other

stories involving students and
the local police are printed? It
obviously should not be. To do
so would be an injustice to the
W&L community. To maintain
our self-governed community,
we must be sure to insist that
our only visible mouthpiece
—the Ring-tum Phi — keeps us
in touch with all facets of life at

W&L.

An apathetic press is but a
mirror of the society it reflects.
Let us hope that our press as
well as our society avoids

apathy.

Sincerely,
Eric R. Fife
Class of ’83

Ehrlichman
A mellowed felon?

By HENRY LANGHORNE
Special to the Phi

He isn’t the same witness we saw ceaselessly bobbing and nod-
ding defiantly before Senator Sam Ervin’s Watergate Committee.
Ask some of the ethical questions he dodged during the investiga-
tion, and he may be defensive, but at least he’ll answer them.

Who knows what changed him? The same sentiment that flared
on Duke’s campus opposing the construction of Nixon’s library
may make us edgy about having a criminal like John D.
Ehrlichman speak here. Is he taking unfair advantage of being a
well known criminal? I heard him tell one interviewer that he
would never go back to law because he is making so much money
writing books and being a celebrity; but still, it is hard to say what
motivates him now.

He calls himself a writer. He no longer is an advance man for
Nixon, Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs, a lawyer, or
a prisoner, but it is easy to see that he has qualities from all his
jobs.

As a writer, Ehrlichman tries to notice and retain the things
writers try to remember. He sat in a table against a window in the
Palms resturant and watched people come and go as he told us
what was wrong with Nixon and Kissinger. Later, he carefully
described to us a group of locals he observed in the Country Kitchen
Bakery on Main St. early his first morning in Lexington. He went
back there for breakfast the next morning.

Ehrlichman says that it was not until after the Watergate trials
and during his divorce that he began to record observations by
writing and sketching. Sure, he had taken notes of all his official
conversations, but he was only recording the words and not the
character of the people he met.

Sketching became one of his favorite pastimes while serving his
20 month prison term in Stafford, Ariz. ‘Sketching teaches you a
whole new way of looking at things,’’ he said. ‘It forces you to see
them differently, more clearly, I think, or more fully than you did
before.”

Ehrlichman has authored two novels: The Company and The
Whole Truth. His latest book, Witness to Power: The Nixon Years has
enjoyed moderate success. ‘‘It was a main selection of the Book-of-
the-month Club for several months, and we’re having a good run
with the paperback edition,” he said. ‘‘It’s hard to expect much
more than that.”’

He writes his works by hand. He tried typing and word processors
but did not feel comfortable and ‘besides, I don’t get the comments
on my writing my typist gives.

“‘I like going over to her house and discussing my book over a cup
of coffee with her and her husband.”’

He is also doing freelance work for magazines. He’s been in-
vestigating the DeLorean trial for some time now, and has written
an article to be published soon. ‘‘DeLorean is messing up,” he said.
“He has teams of lawyers spread all over the country, and none of
them know who will try the case.

“I certainly wouldn’t be happy defending him now,”’ he said.

It was surprising to see how calm and interested Ehrlichman
could be in answering painfully repetitive questions. He would
watch the quizzer intensely, nodding and bobbing, occasionally
raising his right eyebrow in that typical Ehrlichman manner,
pause, and deliver an answer almost straight out of Witness to
Power.

His tranquility was only disturbed when he was asked about cer-
tain aspects of Watergate or times when he felt abused by the
press. He spoke to one of Professor Clark R. Mollenhoff’s classes
the morning of the debate. Mollenhoff had briefly served at the
White House during the Nixon administration as a resident om-
budsman charged with keeping things honest.

At one point Ehrlichman blew up when Mollenhoff said that
politics should not enter in appropriation decisions. ‘‘That’s just ar-
rogant nonsense, Clark,”’ he retorted. ‘‘That’s just not the way
Washington works.”

Ehrlichman is skilled in using advance men. When he became
mired in endless discussion, he would turn to Contact Co-chairman
Mike Skardon and say, ‘‘Mike is this going to make us late?’”’

Taking the cue, Skardon would pry Ehrlichman out of the conver-
sation. It was not long before raising his right eyebrow was capable
of getting Skardon to end a television interview.

People continually asked Ehrlichman about the Environmental
Protection Agency’s problems. The EPA was his agency. It was
established by the Nixon administration and Ehrlichman handled
the domestic affairs for Nixon.

“‘Nixon told me that the environment would never win us any
votes, but it could cost us some. He wanted me to strike some
medium,” Ehrlichman recalled.

“I’ve always been somewhat of an environmentalist, and I really
hate to see what the Reagan administration is doing. I can’t stand
Watt,” he said.

McCarthy cracks jokes

Now, to seem to affect the
malice and displeaure of the peo-
ple is as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their
love. — Shakespeare’s
“Coriolanus, ” 2,ii.

By TODD SMITH
Special to the Phi

For some of us, it was em-
barassing to have a fellow con-
victed of crimes against the
U.S. Constitution getting paid.a
few thousand of our dollars to
crack jokes at W&L. The most
painful moments were when the
audience heaped John
Ehrlichman with applause.

So some of us yearned for
“Clean Gene” McCarthy, the
‘prophet without honor in his

own country,” to put this rogue
in his place.

McCarthy was a very serious
Democratic contender in the
1968 presidential race, where he
showed a stunning appeal to in-
tellectuals, students and anyone
seeking decency in govern-
ment. McCarthy was one of the
first to attack Joe McCarthy,
when it was dangerous to do so.
“And he was, of course, first.to
challenge the presidential
power over Vietman. He was
also among the early critics of
the CIA.” writes William

O’Neill. And he was among the .

first, of the Democrats, at least,
to foresee the economic conse-
quences of the wars on poverty

Ehrlichman on the EPA

By BILL ROBERTS
Editor-in-Chief

During the debate last Thurs-
day, John D. Ehrlichman said
the Reagan administration
made a mistake by trying to
withhold Environmental Pro-
tection Agency documents con-
cerning use of the $1.6 billion
Superfund for toxic waste
clean-up.

“The fellow who decided
Ronald Reagan should invoke
executive privilege instead of
sending all of the EPA docu-
ments up to the Hill or letting
the Hill come down and inspect
them, made a judgement which
turned out to be dead wrong,”’
Ehrlichman said.

“He miscalculated the deter-
mination of Congress, the
volatility of the subject, the
tendency of the press in that
context and obviously made a
mistake which was embarrass-
ing to the President and called
on the President to disgorge
those documents anyway,” he
said.

That is a very disarming
statement coming from a man
who was convicted of obstruc-
tion of justice and two counts of
perjury in the Watergate cover-
up trials of the Nixon ad-
ministration. It would appear
that Ehrlichman has had a
change of heart — that he truly
believes the people have a right
to know and therefore the
Reagan administration should
have been more forthcoming in
answering Congressional re-
quests for information. Not so.

Later in the debate, the EPA
controversy surfaced again and
Ehrlichman tipped his hand
with an interesting analogy.

“It’s the old monkey paw pro-
blem,” he said. “‘If the monkey
puts his paw in the coconut and
he won’t let go, they are going to
catch him,” Ehrlichman said.

“On the other hand, if you let
go of it, as Reagan should have
done the first minute they asked
for the EPA documents, it’s not
going to be the biggest story of
the week.

“If they’re smart, they’ll

and in Asia.

But McCarthy has always
been a proud man. He has con-
stantly refused to play the
demagogue or to prostitute
himself for the press or the
crowd. He seemed to scorn
American political rituals,
wrote David Halberstam, and
“if he had to give good lines, if
he couldn’t help being witty,
then at least he ,could throw
them away.”

At last Thursday’s ‘“‘debate,”’
McCarthy joked about the relief
you get watching a Prepara-
tion-H commercial after seeing
Dan Rather on the news. The
crowd loved it and applauded

make disclosure quickly and
put it behind them. If they are
dumb, they’ll try and cover it
up,”’ he said.

Ehrlichman’s reasoning is
that administrative officials
should give up requested
documents, not because the
public should know all about
them, but because graceful
compliance will result in the
least possible publicity. And
thus the least public knowledge.

The implications are not
small. ‘‘I think Watergate could
very well have been no more
than what Zeigler described it
as (a third-rate burglary) if the
administration had been com-
pletely forthcoming, if the com-
mittee to reelect had been com-
pletely forthcoming, and if they
had done some early surgery,”’
Ehrlichman said.

By extension, we, the
American public, might never
have found out what a scoundrel
Nixon was.

Concerning the EPA’s pro-
blems, if Reagan had done what

Winning is simple for Kaestner

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

It all seems very simple to
Joe Kaestner.

“What you do is win,”’ said
Kaestner, assistant com-
monwealth’s attorney for the
City of Richmond, in a speech
Wednesday at Washington and
Lee University.

“Within the courtroom, it’s
you and it’s him, and it’s win-
ning,’’ Kaestner said.

In his position at Richmond,
Kaestner heads the economic
offenses unit which specializes
in the prosecution of white col-
lar and organized crime; a job,
which it seems, could not give
him any more satisfaction.

“It’s a lot of fun,’’ Kaestner
said, tall and lanky, somewhat
reminiscent of a country
lawyer.

“When you get an elected
public official taking a bribe,
now that’s corruption, that’s
fun.”’

Although his enthusiasm
about his role seems almost un-

Skylark program jumps single-sex gap

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

Last Saturday I had an ex-
perience that every student at
W&L, if not every person in the
world, should have someday. It
is known as the Skylark pro-
gram, and it was a day whose
benefit was only equalled by its
enjoyment.

What is Skylark? Formally, it
is seen as a meeting of a sinall
group of men from W&L and an
equal number of women from
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Co!-
lege with the purpose of coming
to some understandings abcut
men and women and how they
relate, particujarly with
respect to the single-sex situa-
tion of the two schools. Infor-
mally, Skylark came to offer
much more.

bounded today, Kaestner ad-
mitted that he was a while com-
ing around.

Speaking to an audience of
about 120, a large part of which
was Washington and Lee law
students, Kaestner explained
that during his first years at law
school he hated criminal law.

“How can anybody be inno-
cent beyond a_ reasonable
doubt?’’ he recalled his reason-
ing. ‘The arrogance of a jury
case was something absurd to
me.”

But, he explained, his interest
was rekindled when he began to
specialize in organized and
white collar crime while work-
ing with the state attorney
general’s office. His own peak-
ed interest was matched by a
statewide attention on white
collar offenses, he said.

“In 1977, there became a
perception of organized crime,”’
Kaestner said. ‘‘In 1977 there
became a perception of political
corruption.”

Working with the state an-
titrust department, Kaestner

The Skylark program is held
at the Skylark Estate, a serene
setting along the Blue Ridge
Parkway. The property was be-
queathed to W&L some years
ago, and today, serves many
purposes for the university, in-
cluding a sort of presidential
retreat. It is set on a hill which
looks out to the mountains and
down to lake and meadow. The
natural environment provided a
fine backdrop for the day’s ac-
tivities.

The program is conducted
jointly by Dr. Sam Namenek,
psychologist-counselor at
RMWC, and Dr. James Worth,
university counseling psycholo-
gist here at W&L. What the two
provide, essentially, is a base
for the students to take off from.
The doctors lead the discussions
and set up the day’s schedule.

was part of a vehement battle
against corruption which
resulted in more antitrust cases
being filed in 1977 in Virginia
than in any other state.

Although Kaestner exudes a
personal scorn for white collar
crime, he said that juries are
not any more forgiving.

“Juries don’t like white collar
crime and they don’t like cor-
ruption,’’ Kaestner said, citing
figures as proof.

He explained that recent
statisites show that juries give
white collar offenders 300 per-
cent more prison time than they
do common street criminals.

“People just don’t like it,’’ he
said, maintaining that if the
prosecutor makes the case
clear enough, the jury will
follow through with a verdict of
guilty.

“They’re not stupid folks,”’ he
said.

Just as Kaestner stressed
flawless prosecution in the
courtroom, he also explained
that many cases hinge on the in-
vestigation. And just as
Kaestner thrives on an effective

The day was composed of
both general group discussions
and various partnership ac-
tivities, which paired a male
with a female. The partnership
remained for the entire day. In
the group talks we were asked

to freely express our opinions

on the male-female situation
and how we fit into it. What the
members of the group learned
was how the opposite sex view-
ed those problems relevant to
W&L and RMWC. What’s more,
we learned that in most cases

prosecution, he- also enjoys a
good investigation.

“The difference beyween
economic crimes and street
crimes is that the prosecutor is
more involved in the investiga-

tion,’’ he said of white collar in- -

quiries.

“Investigators are marvel-
ous, but they’ll never do the job
as good as you can,” Kaestner
said, explaining that the pro-
secutor must be involved to
make sure his evidence is com-
plete.

Kaestner speaks from ex-
perience, having served as
chief prosecutor in a probe of
the Chesterfield County Board
of Supervisors. That case,
which Kaestner likened to
ABSCAM, resulted in the resig-
nation of the chairman of the
board and one supervisor.

This investigation proved to
him that with enough interest
and motivation, anyone can
conduct an effective investiga-
tion. He added that the Chester-
field police were just as capable
as the FBI or the CIA might
have been.

Each of us came to know what

the difficulties presented by the

Hearing on cocaine charge

By JOHN PERKINSON
Special to the Phi

Charles M. Phillips, a
Washington and Lee sopho-
more, is scheduled to appear for
a preliminary hearing in
Rockbridge General District
Court, Friday, March 25, on a

charge of possession of one
ounce of cocaine with intent to

distribute.

Phillips, of Montclair, N.J.,
was arrested Feb. 4 about 5:15
p.m. near Natural Bridge on an
Interstate 81 exit. The arrest
was made by several special

agents of the Virginia State
Police and Lexington Police Of-
ficer Steven Crowder.

A Lexington Police report
said Phillips had been under
surveillence for three weeks
before his arrest.

State police followed him to
the Roanoke airport where he
picked up a package, according
to the report.

Phillips was arrested soon
after he reentered Rockbridge
County. Police used a dog train-
ed to detect illegal substances
to search Phillips’ car.

“The limits are your own,” he
said.

“The passion in the work
must come from the person who
is willing to do the work.”

Kaestner advocated a
straightforward and_ unhesi-
tating approach when the case
reaches the courtroom.

“If you have to be cruel to
win, it’s fine,” he said.

“It doesn’t matter how you
get the bastards, you just get
the bastards.”’

Kaestner advised the law
students in the audience to tap
all of their resources in fighting
their case, particularly
simplicity, art, and drama.

“It’s supposed -to be dra-
matic, because you are
deciding fate,” he said. “If you
don’t bring a sense of drama,
why should they?” asked
Kaestner in reference to the
jury. ‘‘That’s what separates a
suberb trial lawyer from trial
lawyers. That truly is what it
is.’”’

To Joe Kaestner it all seems
very simple.

were viewed by women. The
same was true for the women.
All of us came to the conclusion
that the ‘‘party scene’’ just did
not lend itself to the kind of
friendship we were looking for.
We wanted to de-emphasize the
sexual aspect that seems to
play so large a role in many in-
stances. The consenses was that
the opposite sex was needed as
more of a friend — that we
needed to hear opinions from
the other side more often. Over-
coming these difficulties, on the
other hand, was a problem we
had no answer for.

The other aspect of the day
was an emphasis on partner-
ship activities with a mate from
the other school. It was here
that the making of a good
friendship was a natural result.
Here, we were able to talk and
laugh with girls in a way that
went beyond the typical ques-
tions of school, year, and major.

In conclusion, Skylark offers
the coed situation which.I think
we all need. It is the kind of at-
mosphere you can’t get at a
university like ours. It’s true, as
well, that Skylark is as valuable
as it is because of the cir-
cumstances of its participants.
No, W&L does not necessarily
need to go coed. However, it
does need more programs like
Skylark to bridge the gap
created by the ‘false environ-
ment’’ of our school. It’s a pro-
gram I once again urge you to
try. It was one of the best ex-
periences of my life. I am sure
you'll find the same.

W&L Graduate

Mann announces attorney candidacy

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Saying that it was too early to
discuss any issues, Laurence A.
Mann, a Lexington attorney,
announced his candidacy for
the Democratic nomination for
Commonwealth’s Attorney.

Mann has a number of ties to
W&L. He received a B.A. in
philosophy from here in 1970,
and has audited courses at the
W&L School of Law. His wife,
Sally, former W&L
photographer, is the daughter
of W&L bookstore manager Bet-
ty Munger.

“T think the voters need a
viable alternative,’’ he said. ‘I
‘feel I have something to offer
the community.’”’ Among rea-
sons for seeking the office,
Mann cited his ‘‘interest in ser-
ving the community.”

The Democratic nominees for
a number of offices, including
Commonwealth’s Attorney, will
be selected at a ‘‘Mass Meet-
ing”’ to be held in May. It is ex-
pected that the Democrats’
choice will face incumbent
Beverly C. ‘‘John’”’ Read in the
election in November.

The Mass Meeting is ap-
parently conducted similarly to
a primary, with all area
Democrats coming to vote for
their preferred candidate.

Mann says he knows of no
other Democratic candidates,

and he ‘‘assume(s)”’ Read will
run for re-election.

Read, who will complete his
eighth year in office in
December, has not announced
his plans, but said Tuesday,
“T’ve enjoyed serving the peo-
ple of Lexington and Rock-
bridge County for seven years,
so I’ve given strong considera-
tion to running for a third
term.’”’ He declined to comment
on Mann’s candidacy.

At a press conference Tues-
day, Mann told reporters, “‘I
don’t want to get into any par-
ticular substantive issues.’’ He
said that it would be premature
until after the Mass Meeting.

Mann said, “‘If Mr. Read has
to be looking over his shoulder
for the next nine months, I don’t
think the Commonwealth is
served.”’

In an interview, Read said
that another candidate’s cam-
paigning would not interfere
with his discharging his duties.
“I’ve attempted to do my best
job as Commonwealth’s At-
torney,” he said. ‘‘I’ve done my
level best. I’ll continue to do
that while I’m in office.”

Mann said he is offering
something ‘‘new”’ and “dif-
ferent” to voters. When asked
what was “new” and ‘“dif-
ferent”’ that he was offering, he
said, “‘That’s difficult to say at
this point.”’

 

 

 

  

 

LAURENCE A. MANN

Asked what the issues might
be once he was willing to
discuss them, Mann said,
“‘We’ll talk about that then.”

In an exchange with report-
ers, defending his repeated
refusal to answer questions on
anything ‘‘substantive,’’ Mann
said, ‘‘No, I don’t intend to be a
Brand X candidate.”

Tn response to a suggestion
that his reticence to discuss
issues might have effect on
voters, Mann said, “I think my
standing in the community and
the service I’ve rendered in the
past make that a moot point.”’

Mann said that at this time,
he has no funds, treasurer, or
campaign committee, but he

 

 

Pearl SABU Ball

a grand success

By GREG COY
Special to the Phi

For the first time in over 12
years, the annual S.A.B.U. Ball
was a financial success. The
ball was held in Warner Center
last Saturday, March 19. The
student event drew three,times
as many people as previous
years, according to Director of
Minority Affairs John L. White.
White is one of the original
founders of the ball which
celebrated its pearl anniver-
sary this year.

“I anticipated a large crowd,
but I never expected the eve-

ning to run so smoothly,’’ White -

said.

The organization sold 300 ad-
vance tickets and another 400 to
the community and neighboring
communities.

“I was a little disappointed
that more of the Washington
and Lee faculty and students
did not show up to see the ef-
fort,’’ White said. ‘“‘We put in
first rate entertainment to
make it a real draw. It was
something all students should
have come to.”

White said that he was pleas-
ed with the support from most
of the people who work for the
University. ‘“‘They work so hard

for us, it was good for them to
have a good time,” he said. “‘We
also believe the event made a
tremendous step in improving
the W&L image in the Lex-
ington black community.”

The S.A.B.U. Ball was not
another Fancy Dress, and it is
not meant to be. Because of its
size the ball was much easier to
clean up.

“We are talking about two dif-
ferent kinds of animals here,’
said Scott Beebe, assistant
director of buildings and
grounds. ‘‘Fewer people usually
means very little mess, and it
was. They did a good job of con-
taining their mess by just hav-
ing beer on the fifth floor of the
Warner Center,’’ Beebe said.

Supervisor of Athletic Main-
tenance Richard Yeakel added

that there was not the same
elaborate decorations, or use of
the classrooms. Fancy Dress
used more space and had more
decorations which made clean-
up more difficult.

The strongest praise went to
S.A.B.U.’s ability to organize
set-up and clean-up of the
building when the ball ended.

White said, ‘‘to me it was one
of the most awesome things I
ever had a chance to watch, and
I mean watch, administer.”’

“The students moved 1,500
pounds of sound equipment
without delay.

“After celebrating for the
rest of the afternoon and night,
they took off their jackets, roll-
ed up their sleeves and cleaned
the place up,” White said.

“I was impressed. I just
couldn’t believe it,’’ said
Warner Center Securityman
Paul Coff. ‘“‘They did not say
they were going to help clean up
but the did.

says he has the ‘‘nucleus of a
committee.”’

“I don’t anticipate any pro-
blems in getting a committee,”
he said

He said that between now and
May, he'll be ‘“‘working primari-
ly with the Democrats in the
county and city to get the tur-
nout to assure we get represen-
tation and a nominee who
reflects the community.”’

Mann, 34, has been practicing
law since last May. He rents
from and shares office expenses
with attorney Thomas C.
Spencer a block from the W&L
campus.

Although he isn’t in partner-
ship with Spencer, he
acknowledged that ‘‘there’s
some overflow I get the advan-
tage of.”’ He says that in his ten
months in practice, he’s been
handling ‘‘a pretty fair mix of
civil and criminal cases.”’

Mann had previously served
as a legal assistant to Spencer.
Rather than going to law school,
Mann successfully completed a
“Study Under An Attorney Pro-
gram,” in which one prepares
for the bar under the supervi-
sion of an attorney. Virginia is
one of the few states that still of-
fers this program.

He told reporters that the pro-
gram requires a great deal of
“self-discipline,” and said that
while he wouldn’t recommend it

for everybody, he had benefited
from it.

“Since the advent of law
schools, this program has died
and we don’t see it much any
more,”’ he said. ‘‘The theory
was that you worked in a law of-
fice...and thereby gained a
working knowledge of the law.”’

Of his decision to take this
route to the state bar associa-
tion, Mann said, ‘‘I sort of fell
into it...It seemed a_ logical
step.”

Mann has been a member of
the Lexington Volunteer Fire
Department, and was the Fire-
man of the Year in 1975. He was
elected to the Lexington City
Council in 1978, and was chair-
man of the Recreation Commit-
tee, Legislative Liaison, and
Shenandoah Planning District
Commissioner.

After graduation from W&L,
Mann went to work for a black-
smith. His press release says he
“earned a reputation which per-
sists through the western part
of the state for fine hand-
wrought iron work.”’

The Constitution of Virginia
says in Article VII that every
county and city will elect ‘‘an
attorney for the Common-
wealth’ who will serve for a
four year term.

The Commonwealth’s At-
torney for this area has ‘‘joint
jurisdiction” over Lexington
and Rockbridge County.

Police chief selection process
advances ; interviews scheduled

Lexington City Manager John
Doane and Lexington City
Council will begin interviewing
applicants for the office of Lex-
ington police chief next week,
according to Mayor Charles
Phillips.

Phillips said Monday that
council has begun narrowing
the field of 75 applicants. The
deadline for submission of ap-
plications was Feb. 21.

“It’s just a matter of deciding
who to interview when,”’ Phil-
lips said.

The applicants will be inter-
viewed by council and Doane.
Doane’s choice must then be ap-

‘proved by council with a simple
majority vote.

The group has met twice in
executive session since the
deadline.

A job description in the city’s
personnel manual describes the
police chief as one who “per-
forms difficult administrative
and complex protective police
work.”

The educational and _ ex-
perience requirements include
graduation from an accredited
college or university with major
work in law enforcement,
public administration and
“related areas.”’

Docherty named resident scholar

The Reverend George Mac-
Pherson Docherty, minister
emeritus of The New York
Avenue Presbyterian Church in
Washington, D.C., will be a
visiting scholar-in-residence at
Washington and Lee University
this spring under the Philip
Fullerton Howerton Endow-
ment Fund.

As the Howerton Scholar,
Rev. Docherty will teach a
seminar on Christian ethics
during W&L’s six-week spring
term.

Born in Glasgow, Scotland,
and educated at Glasgow
University, Rev. Docherty was
minister at Sandyhills Church
of Scotland from 1939 to 1944. He
was minister co-adjutor at the
Barony, the Parish Church of
Glasgow, doing special inner-
city work under the Iona Youth
Trust from 1944 to 1947 and later
served for three years as
minister at the downtown North
Church in Aberdeen, Scotland.

Rev. Docherty was called to
The New York Avenue Presby-
terian Church in 1950 and serv-
ed there until his retirement in
1976. During his 26 years in
Washington, Rev. Docherty ap-
peared regularly on WTTG-TV
(Channel 5) under the auspices
of the Council of Churches. He
also broadcast sermons every
Sunday evening for 10 years

over WMAL radio in
Washington.
In 1954, Rev. Docherty

preached a sermon entitled
“One Nation Under God”’ in the
presence of President and Mrs.
Dwight D. Eisenhower. That
sermon led to an amendment of
the Pledge of Allegiance to the
Flag to include the words
‘under God.”

He is the author of ‘‘One Way
of Living,” a 1958 volume
published by Harper and Row,
and was a contributor to ‘‘That
Day With God,”’’ a compilation
of national religious expres-

Rev. Docherty was modera-
tor of the Washington City
Presbytery in 1962 and has con-
ducted preaching seminars for
the Defense Department for
chaplains in the European
theatre since 1975.

He was visiting lecturer in
homiletics at the Episcopal
Seminary in Alexandria, Va., in
1976-77 and was the J. Omar
Good Professor at Juniata
(Pa.) College in 4979-80.

Rev. Docherty became a
United States citizen in 1960. He
has received honorary degrees

_from Temple University and

Monmouth College. He is cur-
rently residing in St. Andrews,
Scotland.

The Philip F. Howerton Fund
was established at Washington
and Lee by Mr. Howerton’s
widow, Mrs. Emmie Howerton
of Charlotte, N.C., to stimulate
an increased examination and
understanding of the worth of
religious faith on contemporary
society and to reinforce Wash-
ington and Lee’s commitment
to what Robert E. Lee once
termed “‘the very marrow of the
Gospel.”

 

McCarthy

(continued from page 3)
heartily. But McCarthy, as if
deaf, continued his speech
under the din. He refused the
applause.

I have always found that by
refusing responsibility for suc-
cess, I could refuse responsibili-
ty for failure and still live with
myself. This may be wrong, but
I’d bet McCarthy has learned
the same thing. McCarthy stood
up there and didn’t even try to
be entertaining. He didn’t even
try to beat Ehrlichman.

And, many think he didn’t
really try to win the presiden-
cy: The ‘‘New Republic’’ said
he failed the ‘‘passion-test.”’ His
supporters claim he was trying
to project an image of integrity
and honesty and poetic wisdom
perhaps.

But as he chatted about Rus-
sian poetry after the debate in
Fairfax Lounge, I couldn’t help
thinking this ‘honesty’ of his
may be the saddest hypocrisy of
all. He may care so much that
he must pretend not to care at
all. To be ‘misunderstood’ is
much easier to live with, than to
be wrong.

And for you and me it will
always be easier to feel wrong-
ed than to deal with being
wrong. When a professor pours
his heart and mind into a course
and students sit inattentive, it is
easy for him to joke as if he
didn’t care. When I can’t get a
paper in on time, it is easy for
me to despise professors and
fellow students as fools who
worship meaningless grades.

But this easy answer is the
wrong answer. McCarthy cares
about politics and we here all
care about learning. To do
something with this care is
risky. Democracy is a high-risk
venture, said McCarthy Thurs-
day. To strive opens us up to ex-
ternal enemies, enemies who
would judge or ridicule or hate
us; but to care and to strive
saves us from the enemy that
knows best how to thwart us
—that enemy: ourselves.

While it is hard to live with
failure, it is impossible to really
live with resignation. So if I
could go back to that debate, I
just might applaud the crimi-
nal, and not the man who could
have stopped the criminal had
he known how to try.

Debate

(continued from page 1)

McCarthy referred to the in-
creasing secrecy as creating
“an imperial presidency in
which you are saying that the
policy of the presidency is the
policy of the people.”’

Ehrlichman, meantime,
agreed with McCarthy that
“there are certainly some
things that the Congress has the
right to know. But let’s be
realistic. When you tell a con-
gressman anything, expect it to
appear in the Washington Post
the next morning because it
usually does.”

“The rule of thumb in any ad-
ministration is don’t tell them
unless you want to read it,’’
added Ehrlichman, who was a
special assistant in the Nixon
White House from 1969 until his
forced resignation in April 1973
at the height of the Watergate
investigation.

“If there were confidentiality
in the relationship between the
president and the Congress,
there would be a great deal
more sharing of information.
But president after president
has had his heart broken by a
congressman rushing out to im-
press a newspaperman with his
knowledge of the administra-
tion.-It is a continuing problem
and one reason there is less
communication between the
president and the Congress.”’

Ehrlichman added that while
he believes ‘“‘many, many of the
things that go on in the ex-
ecutive branch ought to be told
to the public,” it becomes
primarily a matter of timing
—when the public should know,
rather than what it should
know.

 

McCarthy suggested wryly
that ‘“‘the best justification for
secrecy on the part of ad-
ministrations I’ve known is that
it is not so much that they tell
you about what they’re up to,
but it conceals their ignorance.
There’s a lot to be said for not
knowing -how little they know.
We might be disillusioned, if not
despairing, to know that they
don’t really know what they’re
up to.”

The best exchange of the
evening came not between the
two principals but as the result
of a question from Roanoke
Times and World-News Ex-
ecutive Editor Forrest M. Lan-
don, who was part of a four-

 

 

 

 

McCarthy and Ehrlichman.

Landon zeroed in on the sub-
ject of prior restraint; that is,
prohibited from printing mater-
ial prior to its publication or
punished on a post-hoc basis if
what they print proves to be in
error.

“‘T don’t think a free society is
threatened by prior restraint,”
Ehrlichman said in response to
Landon’s question. ‘‘I do not
understand the First Amend-
ment guarantees to be in any
way absolute. One of the geni-
uses of the constitution is that it
has created a dynamic between
segments of society so that our
relative rights are constantly
being weighed against each
other.”

Sculpture studio is buzzing

Judging from the sounds (and
even most of the sights), Wash-
ington and Lee’s Howe Annex
might appear to be part of the
university’s buildings and
grounds operation.

Where else, after all, would
you expect to find such major
pieces of equipment as a wood
lathe, an arc welder, and a band
saw?

A sculpture studio,
where.

Tucked out of the way on the
back of the W&L campus, Howe
Annex is a small one-story
building that is literally abuzz
(as in buzzing saws) with activi-
ty on a typical weekday after-
noon.

‘For many people this may
not appear to be what they think
of when they think of a sculp-
ture studio,’ admits Larry
Stene, assistant professor of art
at W&L, as he supervises a stu-
dent who is trying to get the
rough spots out of a large wood
sculpture. “The fact is that to-
day the power saws and welding
equipment are almost the tradi-
tional machines, the traditional
tools a sculptor uses.”’

And the equipment, much of it
added to the W&L art depart-
ment this year, is getting plenty
of use.

The products of that use will
be on display later this month

native,” he says. “Our goal
here is a different goal than you
might find in’ oiter situations
where the students are, for in-
stance, not permitted to take an
art course unless they are ma-
joring in art. Here the goal is to
widen and broaden the stu-
dent’s perspective of things. We
have philosophy majors and
chemistry majors and politics
majors spending a few hours a
week welding or working witha
wood sculpture.

“My goal is to put the
students in a setting that allows
them to be creative, to give
them the necessary tools and
materials. But I can’t make
them be creative. That’s up to
them. And I want them to feel
good about the fact that the
ideas they are pursuing when
they start welding a large metal
sculpture together, for  in-
stance, are their own ideas, not
mine.”’

The student show will include
works by 32 W&L students from
the studio classes of both Stene
and art professor I-Hsiung Ju.

DuPont Gallery is open to the
public with no admission

Tonight

Lovin addresses
Christianity and

public policy

An ethics professor from the
University of Chicago will
discuss the ways in which
American Christianity has ad-
dressed public policy during a
lecture at Washington and Lee
University tonight.

Robin Lovin, associate pro-
fessor of ethics and society at
The Divinity School of the
University of Chicago, will pre-
sent the lecture entitled ‘“When
Religion Goes Public: Order,
Freedom, and Justice in Ameri-
can Christianity” at 7:30 p.m. in
Northen Auditorium of the
University Library.

The lecture is open to the
public and admission is free. It
is being sponsored jointly by the
Philip Fullerton Howerton En-
dowment Fund in W&L’s de-
partment of religion and the
university lectures committee.

He received his B.A. degree
in philosophy from  North-
western University in 1968 and
his bachelor of divinity degree
from Harvard Divinity School

in 1971. He earned his Ph.D. in
religious ethics from Harvard,

here he was a teaching fellow
in theology and contemporary
change.

Ehrlichman didn’t seem to be the same confident and combative
man we saw in the televised hearings, but maybe he never was. In
his book, Years of Turmoil, Henry Kissinger had negative things to
say about Ehrlichman and the way he ran his office, but he added,
“rough talk and confrontational tactics were not natural to
Ehrlichman.”

“T really didn’t like myself in the videotapes I saw of the hear-
ings, but I prepared for them like I prepared for any trial, and I was
convinced I was right,” he said. Ehrlichman said that in the past
few years, people he has met often say, “you’re not the person I
thought you were.”

The self-assurance he displayed in the hearings crumbled and
dissolved during his trial as he recounted the day Nixon cast him
overboard. Judge John Sirica had to interrupt his testimony so
Ehrlichman could regain composure.

A year and a half in prison for obstruction of justice and two
counts of perjury confirmed Ehrlichman’s suspicion that our
criminal justice system needs revision. He occasionally gives
criminal reform lectures at law schools.

“Prisons are schools for prisoners,” he said. ‘‘They come out
knowing more methods and contacts,’’ he said.

After prison, Ehrlichman divorced his wife, “ending a marriage
that had been on the rocks for a long time,” he said.

He moved to Santa Fe and rented a small house. Santa Fe has
been a popular place for creative people to retreat. D.H. Lawrence
retreated right up the road in Taos, and Santa Fe is a mecca for tur-
quoise jewelers and tapestry weavers.

By the time he moved to Santa Fe, he had grown a beard and
decided he wanted to be a writer. He bought a Linda Ronstadt
album to play when got tired of his scratched Motzarts.

He is remarried now and has a two-and-a-half year old son. He
drives a white Volkswagen Thing and he cannot stand to be away
from home more than eight days at a time. “If it’s more than eight
days, I get cranky,” he said.

Terrapins prevail as comeback falls short

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

For the second week in a row
the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team almost com-
pleted a comeback, but this
week fell short against the
Maryland Terrapins 13-9 Sun-
day on Wilson Field. The
Generals, now 1-2, can even
their record with a win under
the lights Saturday evening at
Towson State University.

After W&L attackman Joe
Seifert tied it 3-3 with 2:21 left in
the second quarter with an
assist from John Tunney,
Maryland All-American Jeff
Wilkerson connected twice
within the next 34 seconds to
give the Terps the lead for good.
But when freshman Chris John
made it a one-goal game by
scoring with one second left on a
shot taken almost parallel to the
goal, the Generals appeared to
be capable of keeping up with
Maryland in the second half.

The Terrapins, however,
came out and steamrolled W&L
in the third quarter, scoring the
next five goals for a 10-4 lead
with 12:54 to go. Wilkerson par-
ticipated in each goal, scoring
three times and assisting twice.

For the day he had six goals and
five assists.

“We flattened out when
Maryland scored the first goal
of the third quarter,” explained
W&L coach Jack Emmer. ‘‘We
had only four possessions in the
quarter. Our inability to clear
the ball was a big part of that.”
The Terrapins outshot the
Generals 15-2.

After Emmer called a time-
out with the Generals trailing
by six, sophomore Mark
Knobloch converted a rebound
on the extra-man situation at
11:44 to start the charge.

‘“‘We had to go to the goal and
abandon our control-type
game,’’ said Emmer. ‘We
couldn’t just play out the rest of
the game and possibly let it
snowball against us.”

Geoff Wood and Barry Water-
man then scored 20 seconds
apart to cut it to 10-7. Wood’s
goal was made possible when
Maryland lost the ball at its
restraining line on a hard check
by Kevin Walakovits.

Three minutes later, Wood
closed it to 10-9 with two goals in .
11 seconds. With the crowd of
2,500 anticipating the equalizer,
Wood’s behind-the-back shot hit
the right post and rolled out of

a trio of 78’s rounded out the
Generals’ scoring: senior
Frank English, junior co-
captain Whit Kelly, and
freshman Turner Friedman.
W&L’s team total of 306 fell one
stroke shy of Penn State and
two strokes ahead of JMU’s
“A” and “B” squads in the 16-
team field. The Generals finish-
ed ahead of all other Division
III schools. Heavy rains
cancelled the second day of play
in the 36-hole event.

“Bruce overcame the wind
and cold and had a fine round,
but then again we are no
strangers to these weather con-
ditions,” offered coach Buck
Leslie. ‘I was pleased with him
and the others who broke 80. We
need scores like that to continue
our success.’’ Commenting on
the Generals’ second-place
finish, Leslie stated that he was

play.

Maryland’s Tony Olmert
scored on a sharp pass from
Wilkerson with 3:15 to make it
11-9 and two more goals at the
end of long clearing passes
completed the scoring.

“John Tunney was fantastic
on faceoffs, 15-7,” said Emmer

at JMU

pleased that the team finished
as high as it did. “We would
have been paired with Penn
State and JMU on Friday,
which would have been a good
match-up. But we’ll take what
we can get.”

The Generals continued to
play consistent golf this week,
defeating Bluefield College
306-324 in Lexington. Frank
English was medalist on the
day, carding a two-over par 73,
four strokes ahead of the
nearest Bluefield competitor.
Completing the Generals’ scor-
ing were Blythe (75), Friedman
(78), and junior Steve Jones
(80).

W&L continues its sechedule
Friday afternoon at the Lex-
ington course to face

Emmer added that John Doub,
who had a goal and two assists,
had a strong game.

Towson State, which lost its
first game 18-7 at North
Carolina, is an aggressive
team, according to Emmer.
“They like to force the action.

They’re a little undisciplined

they’ve beaten us is when we

Meyer nabs honors

 

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

The General swim team
returned to Lexington from
Canton, Ohio and the NCAA
Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionsihps once again with
laurels as they have done in
every previous national cham-
pionship. W&L’s junior sprint
man Gary Meyer took All-
America honors by virtue of his
performance in the 100-yard
freestyle event.

 

JUNIOR GARY MEYER
..-All-American

Meyer finished 11th out of 36
swimmers in the event, turning
in a 47.32 second time, knocking
.6 off his national qualifying
time. All-America honors are
extended to the top 12 places in

 

each event.

Swimmers post improved
times at NCAA meet

.

In the other events that the
Generals participated in, the
swimmers did not place as high
but their times often dramat-
ically improved.

In the 50-free Meyer clocked
in at 21.88 to finish 23rd in the 25-
man field. The other individual
event for W&L saw freshman
John Moody place 32nd of 40 in
the 100 butterfly. His time was
53.20.

In the relays, the 800 and 400
freestyle, the Generals shat-
tered their previous bests.
Meyer and Moody teamed first
with sophomore Bobby Pearson
and freshman Tim Stanford in
the 800 free to finish 17th of 25
entries. The foursome did,
however, cut 4.25 seconds of
their qualifying time, finishing
at 7:06.90.

The same scenario was true
of the 400 free relay where
Meyer, Moody and Pearson
again teamed up, this time with
sophomore Taber Smith. This
group finished 15th out of the 28-
team field, but they, too, bet-
tered their qualifying time.
They sliced nearly 1.5 seconds
off their previous best time,
clocking in at 3:11.67.

As a team overall the
Generals finished 40th of the 44
scoring teams. The champion-
ships were won by host school
Kenyon College.

W&L suffers three losses

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Three losses and a rain out
dampened the Washington and
Lee baseball team’s week as the
Generals’ record fell to 1-3.

W&L lost a doubleheader at
Virginia Wesleyan 5-4 and 1)-5
and lost to Virginia Military In-
stitute 16-0. A double-header
with Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Emory &
Henry was postponed because
of rain.

‘‘We haven’t been able to get
on the field as much as we
would like,’”’ said W&L Coach
Jim Murdock. ‘‘That does have
an effect on us,’’ he said.

Murdock said he has bee:
pleased so far with the Generals
hitting. Chip Hutchins, Jim Da-
ly, Kevin Golden, Chris
Cavalline and Billy White were
all hitting over .300 after three
games.

“‘T think that everyone has the
potential to be a better hitter
than they are now,’’ Murdock
added.

In the first game of last Tues-
day’s doubleheader at Virginia
Wesleyan the Generals yielded
a run on a wild pitch in the bot-
tom of the seventh inning ‘0
give Virginia Wesleyan a 5-4
win. Sophomore Billy White
was the losing pitcher for the
Generals.

“‘We played well up until the
fifth inning,’’ Murdock said.
“We left 10 kids on base that
game. They can’t dwell on it
though,” Murdock stated.

Wesleyan chalked up its
seventh win against three losses
in the second game of the
doubleheader as the Eagles

Overcoming chilling head-
winds down the homestretch,
the Washington and Lee track
team defeated both
Bridgewater and Eastern Men-
nonite in action Tuesday
Wilson Field, and improved
their record to 2-0. The win over
Bridgewater was especially im-
pressive; not only had
Bridgewater beaten W&L dur-
ing the indoor season, but they
had also downed the Generals in
their previous five meetings.
Head coach Norris Aldridge
commented on the victory,
stating that ‘“‘we took the wind
and the wind-chill in stride.”

Sprinters, hurdlers, and fiek
competitors all had a good day.

ty Thomas took the pitching loss
for the Generals.

Hutchins was the hitting star
for the Generals in the first
game with two hits and two runs
batted in. Golden led W&L of-
fensively in the nightcap with a
pair of hits and three runs bat-
ted in.

VMI never let W&L get into
the game last Thursday as the
Keydets ripped 14 hits and three
home runs in their 16-0 win.

W&L was held to three hits in
the game. Freshman Kirk

The Washington and Lee ten-

welcome with a 9-0 defeat at

team’s record at three wins,

Monday’s victory followed
last week’s roadtrip wins

and Christopher-Newport (5-4)
Saturday’s loss to the Universi-
ty of Richmond (5-1) was

W&L captured first place in
each of the throwing events,
sweeping the javelin one-two-
three.

According to Aldridge, it’s
probably a good thing that the
meet scheduled for last Friday
at Roanoke College was cancel-
led due to inclement weather.
“The extra time gave our in-

play a doubleheader at
Randolph-Macon today and
travel to Lynchburg Saturday
to face traditional ODAC power
Lynchburg College.

“Lynchburg lost a lot of their
kids from last year. They’re
very beatable,”’ said Murdock.

Murdock said that he thinks
there are more good teams and
players in the ODAC now, and
that it is difficult to pick a
favorite for the title. He said
that the addition of Catholic
University to the conference
this year could lead toa few sur-

prises.

“Any team in the conference
can be beaten,’’ Murdock
stated.

shortened by a rain out of the
double’s competition.

The contrast between the
level of play of Division I
University of Richmond and the
Division III ODAC teams like
Roanoke and Emory and Henry
cannot only be seen in the
scores but also in the quality of
play from match to match.

Though W&L handily defeat-
ed Roanoke, the quality of play
in the matches showed sub-par
performances for many team

 

jured members a chance to
recover more fully for this
week’s meet.’

On Friday, the Generals will
host the Newport News Appren-
tice School and Emory and
Henry College at Wilson Field.
The meet will begin at 3 p.m.
