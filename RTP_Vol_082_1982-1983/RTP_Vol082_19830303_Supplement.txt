Opinion

 

Letter

(Editor’s note: The following
is excerpted from a letter Lew
Prichard wrote two years ago
when he transferred to Tufts
University after his sophomore
year at Washington and Lee.
Lew is very critical of the social
life here and recently asked
that this letter be printed. The
reader should remember that
this is a piece of history written
by a lonely sophomore. He is on-
ly offering Some ideas.)

My reasons for transfer are
very simple. I think of myself as
a creative and independent per-
son who is stifled by the social
and intellectual limitations of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. I am sure that I have
cheated myself by coming to
this very traditional, conser-
vative, southern all-male col-
lege, and I am excited about the
possibility of going to Tufts
because I know Tufts has an ex-
cellent learning environment; I
am optimistic that I will at last
have the opportunity to excel as
I pursue by best interests
unrestricted.

I have two types of college-
oriented goals: social and in-
tellectual. There is no distinct
line which can be drawn be-
tween these two catagories
because my social and intellec-
tual goals mesh _ together,
dependent on each  other’s
fulfillment. My main reason for
going to college is to meet peo-
ple, make new friends, and
learn from these relationships.
I feel that it is essential for one
to develop his social and in-
tellectual interests simul-
taneously, that any lack in the
process will adversely affect
that person’s general attitude.

My intellectual goal is to learn
as much as I can about the
world, to enlighten myself so
that I will be able to deal
reasonably with the changing
times which the near future
holds.

Washington and Lee is social-
ly and intellectually stagnant.
The social atmosphere is in-
fected with superficial values,
labels, and prejudice and the
curriculum caters to the
unimaginative, objective stu-
dent who comes here and con-
forms out of his own social in-
security. With superficial short-
sightedness the typical W&L
guy pursues his objective goals.
In the process he accepts labels
and is totally pre-judged and
categorized according to super-
ficial attributes (i.e., fraternity
membership, style of dress,
hair length, overall external ap-
pearance.) The typical W&L
student becomes unable to con-
sider a person in terms of
human assets, to communicate
beneath the facade which he
himself assumes and somehow
accepts as a means of judging
others. With a fraternity he
finds instant social life which he
would otherwise be unable to
have, owing to his incapacity to
associate with others who may
possess deeper means of char-
acter judgment. In obtuse
shallowness this person does
not realize that he has isolated
himself, cultivating superficial
values which not only prevent
his meeting new and interesting
people during his college years,
but throughout his entire life.
Another bad aspect of W&L’s
social atmosphere is that one
generally loses his youth as he

is conditioned to frequent ex-
treme party conditions (heavy
drinking, extremely loud
music, billowing clouds of
smoke). Meanwhile, the
absence of women as students
at W&L has obvious impact on
the entire situation. Not only
are women considered to be in-
tellectually subordinate, but in
this all-male environment they
become objects on male ter-
ritory, to be exploited. I am not
in a fraternity and have no part
of this confusion.

The intellectual atmosphere
is very lacking here because the
student body generally lacks
creativity. W&L’s music de-
partment is very poor, as is its
art department. But these defi-
ciencies are not noticed because
pre-business, pre-law and pre-
med majors have little interest
in the arts. Courses are design-
ed for the objective thinker; he
fills his distribution require-
ment and goes on. Drawing
courses are designed for future

W&L social life called stagnant

engineers and architects, which
is why I have avoided these
courses. What do I call this
situation where _ students
unknowingly limit themselves
in this socially and intellectual-
ly empty atmosphere? I call it
the essence of high class
mediocrity. Years later, the
“successful’’ W&L alumnus will
make his financial contribu-
tions, supporting this tradition
which he may still be unable to
understand.

A walk through the R

By LANIER EDGE
SAB Chairman

One of the country’s premier
college party weekends, Wash-
ngton and Lee’s annual Fancy
ress Weekend, will take place
Aarch 3,4, and 5.

This year’s ball will again be
eld in the more spacious
Varner Center, allowing for the
itroduction of bigger acts. The
10ve to Warner was under-
aken last year to enable alumni
nd invited guests of the W&L
ommunity to attend the ex-
ravaganza. Fancy Dress no
mger is held in the Student
enter where decorating was
ifficult. New techniques in
arms of lighting, staging, and
cowd control had to be adopted
1 the center. The theme this
ear, “Waiting for the Robert

. Lee, An Evening Along the
lississippi’’ centers around a
‘eamboat trip to areas noted
ot only for their geographical

gnificance, but also their

‘emendous night life. Special
reas of the boat itself also will
2 included in the decorations,
-oviding an unforgettable at-
iosphere in which to enjoy the
vening’s entertainment.

Drawn to Warner Center by

vo searchlights and an en-

ance accented in true steam-
yat fashion, one quickly finds
mself on the lower deck of the
iip. Several surprises are in-
uded in- this area while it

‘rves as your avenue to other

teresting areas. The Warner

2nter again will include a sw-

g band, Guy Lombardo’s

oyal Canadians. Decorations

the area will portray one of

e many scenes along the

Center. This area will be
transformed into the upper
deck of the ship and will be a
place for reflection and conver-
sation.

After arriving back on the
main level, the old gym will be
the next stop. An open air
boulevard will form the basis
for the decorations in this area
and the entertainment can be
conservatively described as
awesome. NRBQ and _ the
Voltage Brothers, two very
popular acts in this area, will
alternate sets beginning at 9
p.m. Additional exits are pro-
vided this year to ensure a more
comfortable setting. Anyone
wishing to really cut loose pro-
bably will not leave this area.

The description of the Ball
itself is still incomplete.
Numerous hallways, corners,

and other areas of the larger

rooms are not fully outlined yet.
We will leave these unknowns to
this year’s guests. Certain
small surprises have been in-
cluded, which -will make this a
memorable evening.

Freshman class

The traditional Freshman
class party will again be held at
the Pavilion on the Saturday of
Fancy Dress weekend. Even
with the new ABC regulations
this party promises to be fan-
tastic, featuring two well known
bands. ‘‘Mighty Three plus

Last time the Mighty In-
vaders came to Lexington, they
drew a large audience and left a
growing appetite for more reg-
gae bands. Well, Thursday
night in the Evans Dining Hall
the Rastafarian group will
return to satisfy the hunger.
Reggae, originating from
Jamaica, has spread through-
out the U.S. due to the movie
“The Harder They Come”
featuring Jimmy Cliff and the
mass appeal of Bob Marley and
the Wailers.

Rastafarianism is the
Jamaican-born religion of the
people. The Mighty Invaders’

songs attest to a living God, the
need for unity of all mankind,
the heritage of African culture,

the need for equal rights and
justice, as well as the need for
love and understanding. Rastas
also smoke a lot of herb which
people usually associate with
reggae music. Ms. Cole, a lead
singer in the band, states, ‘“‘It’s
a sacred herb. It’s part of our
religion. It gives us deep in-
spiration.”’

And inspiration is how the In-
vaders convey their music to
new audiences. Reggae music
has influenced such notable ar-
tists as the Rolling Stones and
Eric Clapton, and’ many critics
predict it will have a wider ef-
fect.

The Mighty Invaders’ ‘‘fami-
ly” consists of seven members.
Lead singer Tony Taylor has
been said to have a _ voice
characterized by the rawness of
Bob Marley. and the sensual
crooning of Marvin Gaye. He is
accompanied by Yvonne Dean,
one of few female reggae
singers. Stedford Clark - (bass)
and Colly ‘Sticks’? Hendricks
(drum) give the music its
rhythmic and syncopated tex-
ture. The rest of the band is
Trevor Hibbert (lead and
rhythm guitar), Michelle Cole
(keyboards), and Stanley Cole
(percussion vocalists).

The members are all native
born Jamaicans who moved to
Baltimore to discover the land
of opportunity. Stedford Clark
states, ‘‘My mother came about
15 years ago, and I wanted to
come to see what it is like.
Everybody was talking about
America, that it was a lot freer,
that it had more opportunities
to make money, and I wanted to

“come see,”

After moving to Baltimore,
the members of the band felt
that there was a cold gap be-
tween blacks and whites, sc
they decided to form a band
called the Mighty Invaders to
unify the people. Their songs
are mostly remakes of Bob
Marley, the Mighty Diamonds,
Johnny Clarke, and Peter Tosh,
but they also play originals.

The Invaders have built uj
impressive credentials that in
clude opening concerts for Den
nis Brown (who has sold mor
albums in Jamaica than Bo!
Marley) and the Clash. Thei
music is lively and spirited an
reaches its peak when the au
dience responds to the music.

Also, opening the show Thur:
day night for the Mighty Ir
vaders will be The Stev
Bassett Band. Steve Bassett ha
been around Virginia for
number of years. His band he
changed from its earlier form
new members have given th
band more of a rock and ro
sound as compared to its earlic
beach sound.

NRBQ headlines the old gym Friday

By EDWIN BELL
Phi Staff Writer

Friday night in the old gym
the Voltage Brothers will be
sharing the spotlight with an ex-
perienced and innovative band,
NRBQ. The band has_ been
around since 1969 and has

released several albums. They
are a favorite at W&L and have
appeared at the Cockpit
numerous times. The style of
this band is hard to describe. An

attempt at this would bring to
mind, soul, jazz, R&B, blues,
honky-tonk, C&W, pure pop,
reggae, Motown, touches of
avant garde, Sun Ra, and New
Orleans ‘‘tonk.”’

NRBQ (New Rhythm and
Blues Quintet) originated in
Miami around 1969. The
members of the band include Al
Anderson (guitar), Joey Spam-
pinato (bass), Terry Adams
(keyboards), and Tom Ardolino
(drums).

Recently NRBQ has also add-
ed two horns for a jazzier sound.
Called the ‘‘whole wheat
horns,’’ Don Adams (trombone)
and Keith Spring (tenor sax)
provide this added dimension to
the group.

NRBQ’s debut appearance
came under the Columbia
record label. This record has
been cited for its surprising
predictions of the present
trends. The music was ‘‘jazz-
rock,” R&B, and the current
wave called ‘‘rockabilly’’ (e.g.
Stray Cats). Following their
debut album was a collabora-
tion with Carl Perkins (‘‘Blue

Suede Shoes”’), who has recent-
ly recorded songs with Paul Mc-
Cartney. The effort was titled
“‘Boppin’ The Blues.”’

Next NRBQ recorded ‘“‘All
Hopped Up” and ‘“‘At Yankee

Recently, the band has

label, Red Rooster Records.

Swing with B. Willie Smith in the 500’s

By EDWIN BELL
Phi Staff Writer

When I first heard the name
of this band in conjuction with
Friday night of Fancy Dress, I
was unsure about them. But
after reading their press clips, I
was greatly impressed by their
the credits, each member of the
band is versatile in his skill with
instruments, and each adds to a
feeling that this band will steal
the show Friday night.

Although the band may be un-
familiar in Virginia, they have
gathered a large following in
Maryland and and along the
Eastern Seaboard. The name of
the band is B. Willie Smith. The
members include Bruce W.
Smith, (from which the name of
the band is taken) a versatile
musician who plays lead and
background vocals, drums, and
rhythm guitar. Sharing the

MV

vocals with Smith is Bob Elliott
(bass guitar, synthesizer), and
Jerry Connolly (drums) who
provide the back beat for the
rhythm and blues sound. The
rest of the band is composed of
Steve Baldino (lead guitar,
acoustic guitar, backing
vocals), Mike Cavadini (piano,
alto sax, bass vocals and back-
ing vocals, clarinet), and Bill
Holloman (tenor and baritone
sax, trumpet, organ, piano,
backing vocals, synthesizer,
clarinet). As can be seen from
the credits each member of the
band is versatile in his skill with
instruments and each adds to a
entertaining choreography.

The B. Willie Smith sound is
best described by Bruce W.
Smith.

“Our main influence is from
the Chicago blues scene, artists
like Muddy Waters and Little
Walter. Originally we played
this material. When two of the

The band
from New Haven, Conn.
It has recorded two
albums that received rave
reviews, ‘‘World’s Favorite
Songs” and ‘“‘B. Willie Smith.”
Their song list includes such
rhythm and blues favorites as
“Mac the Knife,’ ‘‘Route 66,”
and ‘‘Secret Agent Man.” They
are noted for their ability to get
a crowd on its feet and dancing.

originates

Probably their best creden-
tials come from their ap-
pearances as the opening band
for Southside Johnny, John Lee
Hooker, and George Thorogood.
So, Friday night, make a trip
upstairs to the 500 level
classroom to see a band that
may steal the show at Fancy
Dress. The B. Willie Smith

Band will soon be another W&L
favorite after its debut at Fancy
Dress.

Voltage Brothers charge FD

The Voltage Brothers are not
at all new to the W&L communi-
ty. This dynamic group of 10
played no less than three times
in four days at Fancy Dress
1982, performing with equal
energy and excitement at each
appearance. The group also ap-
peared at several of the girls
schools last spring and this fall
and have heralded consistently
high reviews.

The band plays a variety of
funk, soul and some rock and
roll. The nearly overwhelming
number of vocalists and in-
strumentalists, the Voltage
Brothers have the ability to
make any room or hall come
alive. Almost each member of
the group plays at least two in-

tradidtion

History books are full of
words about yesterday. Be-
tween the covers of our musical
history is the unforgettable
sound and style of Guy Lombar-
do, a musical force that produc-
ed for America a special kind of
musical magic that was ac-
claimed world-wide.

The responsibility for the
recreation of the famous Royal
Canadians sound has been put
in the hands of Art Mooney, a
personable, energetic and most
talented musician.

The recreation of the Guy
Lombardo’s Royal Canadians is
more than just music. It is a col-
lection of memories and a
reflection of one of the great
contributors to the Big Band
Era. It has become important
therefore that the director of
the reformed orchestra be a
man who was not only musical-
ly capable, but whose musical
Style was in the tradition of Guy
Lombardo.

In assuming the direction of
the Royal Canadians, Art
Mooney is ideal. He has worked
with the greats of that era. He
toiled with them through dance
band remotes and one-night
stands. He shared their joy in
juke box successes. He shared
with them their dreams. And
from that shared experience he
represents the spirit of one of
our brightest musical stars,

Aside from the wide range of

front of the stage the lead
vocalists face the audience
directly and draw it onto the
stage.

The group originates out of a
Rochester ghetto group named
Funky Heavy which was then
taken under the directive wing
of Jerry Griffin in the late 60s.
The nucleus developed from
that band has now been perfor-

ming together as the Voltage
Brothers for more than 10
years.

In 1976, the Voltage Brothers
signed a major recording con-
tract with Lifesong records and
became a part of SAS Inc., who
also produces such groups as
Gladys Knight and the Pips, BB
King, and Gene McDaniels.

Although the Voltage
Brothers present a well known
and unique show, they are con-
stantly changing their reper-
toire to keep up with weekly
developments in popular funk
and soul. No doubt, Friday
night will present another
chapter in the success of the
Voltage Brothers at Washington
