SAB wants $30 for FD

BY RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

The Student Activities Board
is considering a $5 price in-
crease for Fancy Dress

Weekend Tickets, according to
FD Director John Haywood.

Haywood explained that
under the proposal the overall
expense would only go up $2 or
$3 a couple. Part of the price in-

crease would be used to sub-
sidize the Thursday night party.
Traditionally, the Thursday
night function has been a con-

cert, but last year’s concert
featuring the Atlanta Rhythm
Section lost approximately

$13,000. Haywood emphasized
that this year’s Thursday night
festivities would involve more
than one band and would pro-

bably include beer. ‘‘We’re just
re-structuring the ticket price,”
Haywood said.

Student body President Ben-
nett Ross was doubtful. ‘‘What I
want to prevent is raising the
ticket price just to raise the
ticket price. I’m not convinced

Opening the New Year with
three straight wins, the
Washington and Lee basketball
team captured the champion-
ship of the W&L Invitational
and notched Coach Verne Can-
field’s 300th career win.

W&L defeated SUNY-New
Paltz 80-66, Thiel 93-65, and
Lebanon Valley 115-73. The
Generals’ overall record now
stands at 7-2, and the Generals
have reeled off six straight
wins.

Canfield noted that the past
basketball players, the present
basketball family which in-

cludes the parents, and the

loyal fans and faculty that sup-
port the team all deserve part of
the credit for the achievement.
Canfield is especially grateful
to the small group of students
who consistently attend the
games.

Senior forward Brian Hanson
also reached a- milestone this
week, scoring his 1,000 career
point mark.

The team as a whole also
seems to be hitting its stride. In
none of the three W&L victories
last week did the opposition
seriously challenge the
Generals after half time.

“We're playing the way we
should be playing,” stated Can-
field. ‘‘There are some awfully
good signs. What we’re looking
for now is consistency. We want
to continue to do everything
we’re doing,’’ he concluded.

Canfield was also pleased
with the play of some of his
younger players coming off the
bench. He noted that sopho-
mores Jackson MacFarlane,
Lex Fitzenhagen, and Dave
Wilkinson in particular have
made large contributions com-
ing off the bench.

In the victory over New Paltz
the Generals took control of the
game at the outset. A little more
than three minutes into the
game the Generals had opened
up a 12-3 lead over New Paltz;
W&L expanded that lead to
49-25 at the half. Junior forward
John Lee Graves tossed in 19
first half points and Lex
Fitzenhagen added. nine points
off the bench.

New Paltz came out strong in
the second half, scoring the first
eight points of the half. The
Hawks never managed to close
within striking distance of the
Generals though, and W&L
earned a comfortable 80-66 vic-
tory.

Graves led the Generals in
scoring with 24 points. Junior
Billy Yates and Fitzenhagen
also hit double figures for the
Generals with 12 and 13 points
respectively.

In the opening round of the
W&L Invitational, Thiel trailed
the Generals by only seven
points with 4:40 left in the half.
For the remainder of the half
the Generals shutout the Tom-
cats while scoring 19 points of
their own.

“This is due to our defense,”’
noted Canfield of the stretch of
dominating play by the
Generals. ‘‘When we play good
defense, it starts to wear on the
other team,’’ Canfield said.

W&L continued to control
play in the second half, and had
no trouble in posting a 93-65 win.
Billy Rates fired in 19 points for
the Generals and Hanson and
Graves both hit double figures
also.

In the championship game of
the W&L Invitational, Lebanon
Valley managed to stay within
ten points of the Generals at the
half despite a superb perfor-
mance by W&L senior Frank
Eppes. Eppes poured in 17 first-

Hanson’s 1,000th point

half points to spark the
Generals to a 46-36 half time
lead.

The second half turned out to
be even better for the Generals,
as W&L scored a school record
69 points in one half. A three-
point play by Graves put the
Generals over the 100 mark
with 6:09 still to play, and the
Generals tacked on 15 more
points to rout Lebanon Valley
115-73.

Eppes was the principle con-
tributor to the carnage with a
career high 28 points. Graves
hit for 21 points in the game,
and Yates and Hanson tossed in
19 and 18 respectively.

The 115 points was the most
ever scored by a Canfield team,
the previous mark being 114
also against Lebanon Valley in
1974. The school record of 119
points in a single game remains
intact.

W&L placed two men on the
All-Tournament team, with
Yates and Hanson receiving the
honor. Hanson was named the
tournament’s Most Valuable
Player.

Lebanon Valley received the
second place trophy and
Franklin and Marshall defeated
Thiel 96-84 to finish in third
place.

W&L’s next contest is an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
game tonight in the Warner
Center versus Emory and
Henry. As of Monday, Emory
and Henry was 0-3 in the con-
ference and 1-8 overall.

The Wasps have at least two
fine players on the front line.
Boo Chafin, a 6-6 forward, is
averaging 16.9 points per game
and 6-9 center Dave Lawrence
is averaging 12.5 points per
game.

that they know what their pro-
jected expenses are going to
be,” he said.

Haywood replied, saying
‘“‘we’re trying to be very
careful. We’re using very con-
servative sales estimates and
realistic cost estimates. Alumni
participation could swing either
way so we’re not depending on
them to balance our spending.”’
Originally, the SAB had plan-
ned to present their proposal to
the Executive Committee on

Monday, but this was delayed
until next week so that the SAB
could double-check some of
their less certain expenses —
particularly in the areas of
decorations and T-shirts.
Referring to the amount the
EC gives the SAB at the begin-
ning of the year, Ross said,
“Students are going to have to
pay for it one way or another,
however you cut it.”” This year
the SAB was allotted $8,000 for
Fancy Dress Weekend. Hay-

wood estimated that the entire
budget for the weekend would
approach $50,000. This is con-
siderably less than the more
than $70,000 the event cost last
year. Last year’s event, which
was plagued with waste and
poor management, was more
than $20,000 over budget, but
Haywood says that this year
will be different. “‘We’re faced
with a mandate from the EC
that we can’t lose money,” he
said.

Editor Resigns

Citing academic reasons, Todd Smith resigned last
week as editor-in-chief of the Ring-tum Phi. News
Editor Bill Roberts has taken over until a permanent
replacement is elected by the publications board.

Applications for the position of the editor-in-chief
should be submitted to the board immediately.

Roberts, a journalism major, has served as news
editor since mid-November.

Todd Smith’s contribution to the Phi has been
outstanding this year. The layout, writing and depth
of coverage of the paper have improved im-
measurably because of his guidance. Smith has
brought dedication and sensitivity to this paper. He
deserves our gratitude and recognition.

Huntley: a Man
‘of grace and style’

Editor’s Note: The following resolution was adopted by the facul-
ty at its Jan. 3 meeting and is published here at the faculty’s re-
quest.

The faculty of Washington and Lee University praises Robert
E.R. Huntley for his firm leadership during the past fifteen hears
and congratulates him on the outstanding success of his presiden-
cy. His accomplishments are too numerous to note here in detail,
but at this final meeting at which he presides the faculty wishes to
acknowledge with gratitude certain of his achievements.

As president he has been an eloquent spokesman for the small, in-
dependent college and for the liberals education it is uniquely
equipped to provide. His vision of the goals which Washington and
Lee should pursue has been broad and clear, and he has worked
tirelessly to realize them. He has been as mindful of the universi-
ty’s past as of its future, achieving progress that is consistent with
tradition. Both a pragmatist and an idealist, he has ignored neither
the possible nor the utopian and leaves office only after bringing
the university to its strongest position in history.

To that office he brought exceptional qualities of intellect and
character. In dealing with a multitude of questions that only he as
president could resolve, he has shown the finest attributes of a
disciplined mind — incisiveness in identifying issues, judiciousness
in weighing alternatives, fairness and wisdon in reaching deci-
sions. His confidence in the future of Washington and Lee has in-
spired countless others, and his resulteness of purpose has given
the university stability and direction during an era of un-
precedented change. i

He has made the university a central part of his life, and those
who live and work here his daily concern. Toward all of them he has
been cordial and open, utterly without vanity or pretense, and gen-
uinely and deeply interested in their welfare. He has enjoyed an
especially cordial relationship with the faculty, whose meetings he
has often brightened with his sense of humor. He has repeatedly
described the faculty as the greatest strength of the university and
has supported and encouraged it with deeds that matched his
words. He has invariably respected its rights and privileges, and in

turn has grown increasingly to rely on his advice and sound judg-

ment. As president he has remained simply himself, a warm,

humane man who has deservedly won the affection and admiration

of the entire university and of its alumni and friends.

For a decade and a half he and Mrs. Huntley have performed
their roles as president and first lady with grace and style. As they

now complete these roles the faculty expresses its sincere thanks,

and it wishes them, as he has wished thousands of graduates, good

luck and Godspeed.

 

CORRECTION: In the Dec. 9
issue of the Ring-tum Phi, we
ran a story about the Wednes-
day night ‘‘beat’’ of a Lexington
police officer.

While traveling with the
police officer, our reporter saw
a person whom he identified in
the story as Lexington Mayor
Charles F. Phillips. This iden-
tification was incorrect, as Dr.
and Mrs. Phillips were in
Roanoke that night.

 

..» Notes ---

The Ring-tum Phi regrets this
error and any inconvenience it
caused the Phillips family. Also
the Phi regrets that quotes at-
tributed to the officer may have
been either inaccurate or con-
fusing.

Phillips’ statement

Kirby ‘out’ but still in

By BILL ROBERTS
- Editor-in-Chief

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby resigned last week
after Lexington City Council
received the final report of
special investigator L.M.
Walters. But Kirby has been
reassigned within the depart-
ment of police as an inspector to
begin active duty when a new
police chief is hired to take his
place. In the meantime Kirby
will remain on administrative
leave.

Council commissioned
Walters in September to con-
duct an investigation into the of-
fice of the chief of police after
allegations made during the
theft ring trials last summer
raised questions about the ex-
tent of Kirby’s knowledge and
involvement.

Mayor Charles F. Phillips Jr.
said the Walters’ report will not
be made public. The full text of
Phillips’ Jan. 6 statement and
Kirby’s letter of resignation
follow.

“In March of 1982, all of us in
Lexington were shocked to
learn of the alleged thefts, over
a period of years, by then-
current and former members of

Nominations for

Pinney Award

At the end of January, the
University Council will award
the Edward Lee Pinney Prize to
‘“‘an undergraduate student who
demonstrates extraordinary
committment both to personal
scholarship and to the nurturing
of intellectual life at
Washington and Lee.” The
prize, which commemorates a
gifted teacher of politics, was
given last year to senior James
Franklin Williams. Any stu-
dent, faculty member, or ad-
ministrator who wishes to
nominate a student for the prize
should send the nomination to
E.D. Craun in Payne Hall by
Tuesday, Jan. 18.

our Police Department. For
both the City government and
Lexington residents, the entire
episode has been an embarrass-
ment.

“Upon the conclusion of the
cases brought by the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, City
Council felt an obligation to
Chief James A. Kirby and to the
citizens to undertake a com-
prehensive study of the Office of
the Chief of Police. In late
September, Council hired a
man of impeccable credentials
and years of experience — Mr.
L.M. Walters — to make that
study and to report his findings
to City Council. We felt it ab-
solutely essential to separate
fact from rumor, before any

decision could be made
concerning a reorganization of
the department.

“The need to make such a
separation of fact from rumor is
well illustrated by citing but one
example. It has been widely
reported that Chief Kirby

 

received a 14-page memoran-
dum from a member of the
Police Department, detailing or
expressing suspicions about
thefts by members of the
department. As late as this past
Wednesday morning, this state-
ment was repeated in a
newspaper story about Coun-
cil’s Special Meeting on. the
previous evening. And yet, this
statement, so widely circulated,
was a rumor and not a fact. As
is made clear in Mr. Walters’
Report, and in testimony beforé
the Circuit Court by the State
Police Investigator, the so-
called 14 page memorandum
was given by an officer to Chief
Rhodenizer — not to Chief Kir-
by — and had nothing to do
about alleged thefts by
members of the Police Depart-
ment.

“It was just such rumors that
lead to Mr. Walters’ study for
Council — his report was given
to Council on Dec. 8, 1982.

Exhibit :

An exhibition of works by con-
temporary American artist
Lowell Nesbitt have beeen on
display in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery
since January 3, 1983.

The exhibition, including oil
paintings, etchings, serigraph,
and stained glass, will remain
on view through January 28.

Lowell Nesbitt Display in duPont

The Nesbitt exhibition was ar-
ranged with the support of Dr.
and Mrs. Jacob Joseph Wein-
stein of Washington, D.C., who
have been loyal patrons of
Nesbitt for almost 20 years.
Many of the paintings that com-
prise the exhibition have come
from the Weinsteins’ personal
collection. Dr. and Mrs. Wein-
stein have been active in their
support of Washington and
Lee’s art program and have
established the Dr. Jacob
Joseph and Mrs. Bernice Fox
Weinstein Collection, which
features a number of important
art works, at the university.

Nesbitt is a native of
Baltimore, Md. He earned the
bachelor of fine arts degree
from the Tyler School of Fine
Art in Philadelphia in 1955 and
studied stained glass and etch-
ing at the Royal College of Art
ii London for two years.

He taught printmaking at the
Baltimore Museum of Art for
three years and also worked for
four years at the Phillips Collec-
tion in Washington, D.C., before

moving to New York in 1963

where he has lived and worked
ever since.

According to Debora Rindge,
instructor in fine arts and direc-
tor of the duPont Gallery at
W&L, Nesbitt’s style is influenc-
ed dramatically by the fact that
he uses photographs rather
than real objects in the creation
of his work.

“He uses photography as both
a matter of convenience and a
method of distancing himself
from the object,” notes Ms.
Rindge. ‘Some photographs
are taken by him, some by other
photographers under his direc-
tion, while others are found im-
ages discovered in catalogues
specializing in, for example,
seeds or machine parts.”’

An extremely prolific artist,
Ms. Rindge observes that
Nesbitt ‘‘tends to concentrate
intensely on one theme at a
time....”’

He is perhaps best known for
his paintings of flowers. Many
have compared his paintings of
flowers with those of Georgia
O’Keeffe. One critic has even
referred to Nesbitt as ‘“‘the
foremost living painter of
flowers.”’

Nesbitt has had numerous
solo exhibitions in some of the
world’s major galleries and has
been commissioned to do
several works, including paint-
ings for the National

Superdance Plans

To Raise

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

Plans for the fifth annual
Washington and Lee Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance are pro-
gresssing well according to
Townsend Oast, Superdance
Committee Co-chairman.

The committee has set a goal
to raise $24,000 in this W&L
tradition which is designed to
involve the entire Lexington

| community. The event will take

place in Evans dining hall Jan.
28-30.
Dancers are expected from

all the local women’s colleges,

VMI and Lexington High

| School, but the committee is
| trying to stress the importance
| of participation of W&L

$24,000 |

students.

“Dancers will have the best | |
seats in the house to hear the | |
bands,” said committee |
member Steve Geary. He added
that they will be provided with
food, beer and T-shirts.

Both Oast and Geary stressed |
the importance of participation |
of upperclassmen and fraterni-
ty members.

“There has been lots of in-
terest but now people have to
decide to dance,”’ Oast said.

Prizes for those dancers who |
raise the most money include |
trips to New Orleans, the
Greenbriar, and the Home- |
stead. In addition, a trip to |
Hilton Head, S.C. will be raffled

off for those who bring in at

Kirby

(continued from page 2)

Subsequently, Chief Kirby re-
quested a meeting with City
Council and, because of the
Holiday season and the need to
give everyone time to prepare
for that meeting, it was held
last Tuesday night, Jan., 1983.
Last night, Jan. 5, 1983, the
Special Meeting was continued
so that Council could meet with
its consultant.

“A few minutes ago, in Ex-
ecutive Session, Chief Kirby
presented the following letter to
Council:

‘* ‘Effective this date I hereby
tender my resignation as Chief
of Police for the City of Lex-
ington, Virginia, and do
respectfully request that I be
assigned to another position
within the police department.

“Tt has been my privilege
and pleasure to serve as your
Chief of Police these past years.
I appreciate your consideration
of these matters.’ — Respectful-
ly submitted, James A. Kirby,

 

Hi6 N. Main St.

Chief of Police.

“City Council accepts, with
appreciation, Chief Kirby’s
resignation as Chief of the Lex-
ington Police Department. In so
doing, however, Council wishes
to emphasize that it has never
questioned James A. Kirby’s
loyalty to the Department and
the City, or his personal honesty
and integrity. Our consultant’s
report supported our position,
when it was concluded: ‘In the
course of inquiries conducted,
no one has suggested that Chief
Kirby was other than personal-
ly honest.’

“However, the consultant’s
report did confirm our concern
about the lack of vigorous ad-
ministration of the Police
Department. As a result, and to
provide improved administra-
tion, the City will immediately
begin the process of advertising
for, and hiring, a Chief of
Police; a process that will take
several months.

“In the meantime, Sergeant
Beard has consented to remain
as Acting Chief. We would be
remiss if we failed to express
our deep appreciation, on
behalf of all the citizens of Lex-
ington, to Sergeant Beard and
the other members of the Police
Department for their extra
work and strain during these
difficult months. Their dedica-
tion has made is possible to pro-
vide adequate protection during
a period of severe shortages.
They deserve our sincere
thanks.

“In his letter of resignation as
Chief, Mr. Kirby requested
reassignment within the Police
Department. This request, we
are pleased to announce, also
will be granted, thus making it
possible to retain the services of
an individual who has served
the city continuously for over 30
years. In keeping with discus-
sions between City Council and
the City Manager over the past
few years, concerning the need
to reorganize and strengthen
the Police Department, and
upon the recommendation of
our consultant, Council will
establish a position of Inspector
within the department, which
will report directly to the Chief
of Police. The City Manager has
approved Mr. Kirby’s appoint-
ment to that position. This addi-
tion will strengthen the Police
Department and fill a serious
need in providing protection
within the City. It is con-
templated that Mr. Kirby will
assume that position upon the
hiring of a new Chief of Police.

“To the citizens of Lexington,
let me add a final word. As
noted earlier, the events of the
past ten months have been an
embarrassment to us. all.
However, speaking for the
Mayor, and Council, the City
Manager, and the City At-
torney, we express our ap-
preciation for your patience and
understanding as we debated
the proper, long-run solution to
the problems presented. We
hope that you will continue to
show the same patience and
understanding in the coming
months as we select and greet a
new Chief of Police to our com-
munity.

Sinfonia Performs Annual Concert

By BRUIN RICHARDSON
Special to the Phi

Annually there is a
remarkable event that takes
place on the campus of
Washington and Lee. A small
symphony, the Richmond Sin-
fonia, performs in an equally
small building, Lee Chapel, and
the result is magnificent. Such
was the case this past Monday
evening. Playing to a large and
responsive audience, the Rich-
mond Sinfonia not only con-
tinued the high standard of ex-
cellence that has been exhibited
in the past two Concert Guild
presentations, they added the
element of graceful power
which can only be achieved by
performers so well suited to
their stage.

The Sinfonia, conducted by
Jacques Houtmann, began the
evening with Mozart’s Diver-
timento No. 11 in D. Major. The
piece was crisply played, as
were all the selections, and was
well received by the audience.
Following the Mozart was the
Symphony No. 103 in E-Flat by
Franz Joseph Haydn. This sym-
phony, known as the “Drum

There will also be activities
for the dancers during the

exercises with Coach Norman

People interested in dancing

Following intermission the
Sinfonia presented Albert
Roussel’s ‘‘Sinfonietta for
Strings.’’ A work from the early
20th century (1934). This selec-
tion was reminiscent of early
movie scores. However, regard-
less of one’s bias toward 20th
century music, the piece was
well played and it effectively

presented still another style of
music.

The final piece scheduled on
the program was Mendels-
sohn’s Symphony No. 4 in A Ma-
jor, the “Italian.” The last
movement of this work involved
a race between the symphony’s
wind instruments and strings.

‘Discreet’ Film Friday

The Washington and Lee Film
Society’s next presentation of
the 1982-83 season will be Luis
Bunuel’s ‘‘The Discreet Charm
of the Bourgeoisie’ (France,
1972; 100 minutes). The film will
be shown at 8 p.m. in Classroom
A of Lewis Hall in the W&L Law
School. There is no charge for
admission and the public is in-
vited.

“Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie”’ is one of the most
accomplished works of a
master film-maker and _ its
humor and insight will
delightfully astonish the
viewer.

The plot, such as it is, of
‘Discreet Charm’ involves the
attempts of a group of well-to-

do people to have dinner
together. Their efforts are
repeatedly frustrated by a
series of interruptions, and it
becomes apparent that these in-
cidents are various dreams ex-
perienced by the  film’s
characters, each dream drama-
tizing fears ranging from mere
social embarrassment to
violent death.

Bunuel and other surrealists
consider “plot” and ‘“nar-
rative” to be inhibiting artistic
conventions. Uninitiated
viewers will certainly find it
disconcerting when the film’s
“plot” continually deteriorates
into a discordant series of ap-
parently unrelated bizarre oc-
currences,

were victorious, but the winds
were certainly not losers in that
this piece allowed them to
display a great deal of talent
and technique. In response to
thunderous applause the Sin-
fonia played Beethoven’s
“Overture to Prometheus’ as
an encore, a fitting end to a fine
concert.

The next Concert Guild
presentation will be on March

10 as they sponsor a concert by
the Stradivardi String Quartet
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.
Students of W&L and surround-
ing colleges are admitted free
of charge. Concert Guild Board
members include Professor
Robert Stewart, James
Baldwin, Roger Day, Todd
Jones, Christopher Schram,
Bruin Richardson and Jeffery
Wells.

President Wilson Takes Office Monday

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Dr. John D. Wilson, who is to
succeed Robert E.R. Huntley as
president of Washington and
Lee University, will make his
first official appearance before
students and faculty next
Wednesday at a combination
ceremony for Founders’ Day
and the annual Omicron Delta
Kappa convocation.

Wilson takes office Monday
and will be the keynote speaker
of the assembly, which is to be
held at 12:30 p.m. in Evans din-
ing hall. Class schedules will be
shortened for the day, which is
Robert E. Lee’s birthday.
Outgoing president Huntley is
expected to introduce Wilson.

Omicron Delta Kappa is a na-
tional honor society founded at
W&L in 1914. ODK states its
purpose as the recognition of
“leadership in various fields
—scholastic, athletic, social,
religious, and literary.”

Inductees to the society will
be ‘‘tapped’’ in at the
ceremony, and special recogni-
tion will be given to Professor of
Politics, Emeritus, Rupert Lat-
ture, who is the only living foun-
ding member of ODK.

Farris Hotchkiss, Director of
W&L’s Development Office,
says that the ODK and
Founders’ Day events have
been held on the same day for a
number of years. “For a long
time,’’ he said, ‘‘there were two
separate assemblies...but as
time marched on, the practice
of university assemblies grew
more awkward.

“As we moved into the 1960s
and 1970s, it seemed more sensi-
ble to combine the Founders’
Day and ODK ‘tap’ ceremony.”

Hotchkiss said, ‘“‘it seemed a
particularly appropriate time
for Wilson to talk to the faculty
and students.’’ He said, ‘We
will be there to welcome him to
the campus and tell him we’re
glad he’s the president.”’

The identity of ODK inductees
will remain secret until the
ceremony. Hotchkiss said that
“in more recent years, three or
four adults are tapped into ODK
as honorary members.” He
says they are “almost always
alumni’’ who ‘‘for one reason or
another were not inducted while
they were here but have achiev-
ed notably well in their careers
and so are recognized after they
graduate.”

Founders’ Day, Hotchkiss

said, ‘“‘observes, as the name
implies, the founding of this
university. It harks back to our
origins and recognizes that
there would be no university if it
hadn’t been for the men who
literally hundreds of years ago
founded it.”

The ceremony, ordered an-

‘ nually by the Board of Trustees

is, according to Hotchkiss, ‘‘a
time to stop and make that
observance. It commemorates
the origins of the school and the
tradition from which it
springs.”

The ceremonies will be held
in Evans Dining Hall, and
Gerald Darrell, Director of
University Dining and Food
Service, says box lunches will
be provided for students. Con-
tract students may pick up the
lunches from the No. 1 serving
line immediately following the
ceremony.

“To make up for the box
lunches,” he said, ‘‘that night
we'll be having our annual
Founders’ Day Dinner.’’ The
“special General Lee’s Celebra-
tion Dinner’’ will consist of all
southern foods — fish chowder,
peanut soup, steamship round
of beef, fried chicken, spoon
bread, and corn on the cob. It’s

maxell.

available to non-contract
students for $5 or six points.

Dr. Wilson was elected to the
presidency just prior to the
start of classes this year, and
will be inaugurated on May 19
at the Board of Trustees
meeting. In 1968, Huntley took
office in February and was in-
augurated eight months later.

Huntley, the only alumnus to
serve as president of the univer-
sity since before the Civil War,
will be returning to his former

The Executive Committee is
clarifying its position concern-

the face of an honor hearing.

The clarification provides
that if a student withdraws
before his hearing, he is no
longer in good standing with the
Alumni Association. Previous-
ly, only the Registrar’s office
was notified of this change in
standing. The policy clarifica-
tion was made at the request of

this to the Executive Commit-

hopes that we will have a
response by our Spring

wrote in a letter to the Board of
Trustees of the univeristy dated
Oct. 12, 1982.

‘“‘We’re just balancing the dif-
ference between what the
Alumni Office has and the
Registrar has,’”’ Bennett Ross,
student body president, explain-

Under the new policy, a stu-

Swimmers open ’83 season

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

The W&L swim team reopens
its 1982-83 schedule this
weekend with meets against
James Madison in Harrison-
burg on Friday and a three
squad contest on Saturday here
in Lexington where the
Generals will face VMI and
Towson State.

Fourth-year head coach Page
Remillard sees his 2-1 Generals
traveling a road of constant im-
provement. Remillard is quite
pleased with the individual per-
formances and attitudes that
have been developing. ‘‘They’re
looking forward to every

Water Polo

workout and so am I,” said
Remillard.

In a word, Remillard sum-
med up the swimmers’ practice
performance: ‘‘Super.”’ He con-
tinued, saying, “I’m totally con-
fident that each swimmer will
be justly rewarded for their ef-
forts this year.”

This month will be comprised
of five dual meets, and although
the W&L team role will not be
dominant one, Remillard hopes
his individual swimmers will
start to come into their own dur-
ing this time. ‘‘The big
challenge will be their ability to
perform despite the team’s
results,’’ noted the Generals’
mentor, who also explained that

Washington and Lee University
aquatics director Page
Remillard will serve as team
leader/envoy for the United
States water polo entry in the
1983 World University Games at

The International University
Sports Federation, sponsor of
the games, anticipates 4,500
athletes and officials represen-
ting 85 nations to compete in the
bi-annual event, set for July
1-11. An estimated 700,000 spec-

Wrestling

Generals

By SCOTT SLADE
Phi Staff Writer

The Blue Devils of Division I
Duke University ceded only one
match to the Washington and
Lee wrestling team in action
last Saturday en route to

posting a 46-3 win. Jeff Dixon
salvaged a 9-5 decision after
falling behind early in his 190 Ib.

match. The loss drops the
Generals’ overall record to 2-1
on the season.

‘According to Head Coach
Gary Franke, the young

General squad ‘“‘seems to be
progressing.”” Last month’s
W&L Invitational and last
week’s match-up with Duke has

provided Franke’s team with
some formidable and hopefully

nation’s best water polo players
in competition on July 8, 9, 10
and 11 in the 4,700-seat Kinsmen
Aquatic Centre. Cutino is water
polo mentor at the University of
California at Berkeley, Horn is
head coach at UCLA.

“This is a remarkable oppor-
tunity for a man who has
already proven himself a suc-
cesful water polo leader at W&L
and across the nation,’’ states
Bill McHenry, W&L director of
athletics. ‘“‘The university is
honored and proud to have Page
selected for such a fine assign-
ment.”

In four seasons Remillard has
guided the Generals to a 94-35
record, the 1981 and 1983
Southern League titles, and four
appearances in the Eastern
Championships. Outside the
university, he coached the gold-
medal East water polo team at
the 1981 National Sports
Festival in Syracuse, N.Y. and

during the dual meets we’ll try
to ‘‘accentuate the highlights of
the individuals.”’

Leaders for the Generals
heading into the dual meet
schedule include junior Gary
Meyer in the sprints, classmate
Tim Rock in the 500, 1000, and
1650 yard freestyle events, and
freshman Tim Stanford in the
butterfly. Remillard looks for
all three to qualify for the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ships.

After the Towson State-VMI
meet, the W&L swimmers
travel to Shepherd College on
Jan. 21 and then return home
next Saturday with a meet
against Georgetown University.

directed the silver-medal South
squad at the 1982 Festival in In-
dianapolis. He has also served
as an assistant coach for the
U.S. National Junior Develop-
ment team during the past
three summers.

“The Sports Festivals and the
National Junior team provided
tremendous first-hand coaching
experiences. In Edmonton I
hope to expand my experiences
in sport administration and
public relations,’’ reports
Remillard, who describes his
Games’ position as one of a
manager and troubleshooter.

‘In simple terms, I’ll make
sure that all the coaches do is
coach and the players play.
Specifically I'll handle
itineraries and training ar-
rangements, solve problems
with officials and equipment,
and secure any materials and
information we may need.

valuable experience. The
Generals will be needing this
experience when they travel to
Atlanta this weekend to com-
pete in tournament action
hosted by Georgia Tech, as only
one of the other seven op-
ponents is a Division III school.

The team will be starting four
freshmen and no seniors this

weekend as the Generals’ cap-
tain Tim Valliere will be sitting
out this weekend with a sprain-
ed ankle suffered against Duke.

However, Valliere should be
back strong and in the starting
line-up for the W&L Invita-

tional, to be hosted in the
Warner Center on March 22.

Remillard expects the U.S.

dozen players, all of whom will

Olympic team and many of
whom will play on that team.”’
