EC divies up
$102,000 pie

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

As has become both a tradi-
tion and a_ necessity, the
representatives from W&L’s
large variety of clubs and
organizations met with the
members of the E.C. last
Wednesday and Thursday
nights, begging for scraps from
the Committee’s $102,000
budget.

Requests ranged from the
Mock Convention’s request for
$300 to cover office expenses to
the SAB’s gargantuan request
of $58,370.

The first evening’s business
was uneventful until the Inter-
national Club came up to re-
quest $1,837.

When Senior Rep. John Vla-
hoplus moved to appropriate
$1,400, club president Henry
Baey’s reaction was “It could
be worse.’’ EC President Ben-
nett Ross reminded Baey, “It
might still be.’’ It was; the club
got $1,100.

Phil Murray of the Calyx
made what he called a “‘more
than reasonable request ot
$10,900.’ The next evening,
while searching for money to
give the SAB, the EC made it an
even more reasonable $10,000.

The biggest discussion of the
Wednesday night meeting was
about Focus and its publication,
Excelsior. Focus was set up by
last year’s committee to estab-
lish a symposium every four
years to consider philosophic

scientific, economic aspects of
specific issues, for example,
“nuclear energy.”

‘“‘What we’re looking at here
is another damned expensive
Mock Convention,’’ Vlahoplus
said. ‘I think it’s only fair that
the Administration foot the bill
because it is an academic pur-
suit,”

The question became not how
much money the EC should give
it.

‘“‘We expect to have lectures,
seminars, pamphlets, and dis-
plays at the Symposium and if
the money and the commit-
ment aren’t there on the part of
the university, we might as well
forget it,’ said Chris Bouquet,
chairman of Focus. The general
feeling on the Committee seem-
ed to be one of ‘‘let’s keep it
afloat but not support it com-
pletely.” As a result the Com-
mittee voted to give them $600
of their requested $995.70, hop-
ing that the university would
get the message that the EC
would rather not support the
group completely.

The Student Bar Association,
represented by John McGarry
and Fred Earley, had a novel
approach to the proceedings.
Before they got very far into
their presentation, the SBA
made voluntary cuts of $2,000.
This was not quite enough, for
the EC however, which even-
tually gave them $16,800 of their
originally requested $19,455.

Police raid Chi Psi party

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

Sheriff's Deputies, State
Troopers and alcohol control of-
ficials raided a party at
Zollman’s Pavilion Friday,
charging six Washington and
Lee University students with
criminal offenses.

The party, sponsored by the
students, was a private function
featuring the Robbin Thompson
Band.

Three members of Chi Psi
fraterntiy and three other
students received the charges
which were class one misde-
meanors punishable with a 30-60
day jail sentence and a $50-$100
fine.

Spokesmen for the State In-
formation Office and the Staun-
ton Office of the Alcoholic
Beverage Commission refused
to comment on the incident.

Danny Einstein, president of
Chi Psi, appeared before the
Student Executive Committee
Monday to explain his side of
the incident. Einstein stressed
that every precaution was
taken by those involved with the
party and that technically they
were selling tickets for the band
and not for the beer which was
free.

In response to Einstein’s re-
quest for support, the EC
released a statement backing
those who were charged saying
“this committee believes that
the persons involved are essen-
tially victims of selective en-
forcement and possible faulty
application of state liquor
regulations.”’

A party of similar nature was
held by the sophomore class on
Homecoming Saturday. A band
performed at the party and

vodka punch was served to
those students permitted inside
the party who had previously
shown a class pass or payed $4

at the gate, according to
sophomore Class President
Kevin Kelly.

Because admittance to the
party specified a class pass or
Status as a guest of a W&L stu-
dent, it was similar to the party
raided Friday which required a
college id.

The ABC was aware of the
sophomore party because the
vodka was purchased at a local
state store, Kelly said, but did
not chose to raid it.

It was inconsistent cases such
as this and others that prompt-
ed the Executive Committee’s
vote of confidence for those in-
volved with the party raided
Friday, according to Senior
Rep. John Vlahoplus.

 

Diplomat predicts pipeline will make news again

Special to The Phi

The East-West natural gas
pipeline could jump back into
the news soon, a West German
diplomat said at Washington
and Lee Friday, Oct. 8.

Jurgen Weiss, the assistant to
the Ambassador of the Federal
Republic of Germany to the
United States, spoke under the
auspices of the International
Club about the pipeline deal and
its relation to the general
development of detente in the
West.

Fighting in Lebanon has
crowded the pipeline off the
front page of newspapers, but
the West German government’s
recent shift from moderate-

leftist Social Democrats to
right-wing Christian Democrats
could change that, Weiss said.

In a brief review of West Ger-
many’s politico-economic_his-
tory from the post-war years to
the present, Weiss explained
the Federal Republic’s initia-
tion of Ostpolitik in the late
1960s. According to Weiss, Ger-
many and the East Block States
agreed to ‘‘...renounce the use
of violence to change borders,
but leave open the chance to
change borders by peaceful
means.” This is important to
West Germany because it
secured the potential of reunify-
ing the two Germanies, the
Federal Republic’s supreme
“national goal.’”’

By the early 1970s, the rest of
the Western world followed
Germany’s. example with the
policy of detente.

“Americans and all Euro-
peans agreed that we should try
to seek cooperation with
Eastern countries, and
especially with the Soviet
Union, and base this coopera-
tion on military strength. We
cannot bargain with a basis of
military weakness because the
Soviets respect strength,”
which Weiss referred to as an
“unfortunate fact of life.’’

Mr. Weiss then commented
on today’s political climate
regarding the East and Russia
as a “period of change.” “In

EC supports Chi Psi

Editor:

The Executive Committee of
the Student Body has adopted
the following statement in
regard to the Virginia Alcoholic
Beverage Commission’s recent
actions during the Pavilion par-
ty of 8 October featuring the
Robbin Thompson Band.

“The Executive Committee
hereby expresses its confi-
dence in those six individuals
and the Chi Psi Fraternity as a
whole who have been accused of
legal wrongdoing involving the
sale of alcohol.

“Because the function in
question was administered con-
sistently and, in some cases,
even more stringently than past
University sponsored events,
this Committee believes that
the persons involved are essen-
tially victims of selective en-
forcement and possible faulty
application of state liquor
regulations. Moreover, because
the practices of the Alcoholic
Beverage Commission have a

direct bearing on the structure
of all future social events at this
university, the Executive Com-
mittee is commited to seeking a

All ‘a part of my community’

“Wasn't it terrible about
Jack. You know, one of those
boys lives just below the
house.” It was last Saturday
evening and I was over at the
home of my former landlady.
We must have talked for over
an hour about “goings-on” in
our respective lives and were at
that moment discussing the re-
cent assault on Jack Roberson
by the youths in Lexington.
Once I left Mrs. Shaners, I
began to think about Mr. Rober-
son, the boy below the house,
the Shaners, and myself.

What came to mind was the
real closeness that all of us
shared. Mr. Roberson was not
simply another casualty read
about in the paper. He was my
neighbor whose house I had
passed innumerable times on
my way to and from school.
Mrs. Shaner, my former land-
lady, was oh so much more to
me. She was my neighbor, too.

And even that boy who ‘“‘lives
just below the house’’ was my
neighbor in Lexington. The
point was that I was myself not
merely a college student on an
extended visit to a Virginia
town. No, I realized that Lex-
ington was my town and her
people were mine. “Bone of my
bone, flesh of my flesh.”’
Chaplain Caudill of the Vir-
ginia Military Institute was
quoted in last week’s Phi as say-
ing that ‘“‘We need to develop a
feeling of caring.... Let’s suffer
together and rejoice together.”
Of course, Chaplain Caudill is
so right. We all should suffer
when one of our own dies in an
accident or is assaulted in his
home. And when Mrs. Shaner
offers me a piece of pie I rejoice
with her in the bounty of her
cupboard and smile as I enjoy
her marvelous Southern hospi-
tality. And I pause to think of
that boy below the house who is

also a part of my community. A
neighbor.

To my way of thinking, one of
the grandest traditions at Wash-
ington and Lee is that of
greeting one another along the
walk. It is our way of recogniz-
ing each other as neighbors in
the academic community. Re-
gardless of how grouchy or in-
sincere the “good morning”’
may sound, it is to my mind a
huge step in the right direction.
A step towards acknowledging
each person on the walk as a
fellow human being, someone
worth saying “‘hello’’ to.

It was terrible about Mr.
Roberson and I’m sure many of
us swore an oath or shed a tear
at reading about the attack.
Good, I say. Good that we
should care enough to react in
some visible manner. Because
Jack Roberson is our neighbor.

Analysis

Fraternities
must answer up

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

EC President Bennett Ross went to Tuesday’s In-
terfraternity Council meeting with a few questions.
What he got were surprisingly good answers, and a
promise of action.

Who will pay for the Contact speakers program,
Ross wanted to know. Feeling budget restrictions, the
EC granted only $8,500 of the $12,000 Contact asked
for. That’s not odd, considering that only one club got
what it asked for.

What was odd was the abuse heaped on the IFC in
its absense. The EC was ‘“‘ticked’’ to have to decide
how to fund Contact without any idea of how much the
IFC would chip in. The IFC originally financed all of
the Contact budget, as a way of improving the frater-
nities’ image on the hill. The EC was invited to share
the cost in the 70s, and recently has paid more for
speakers than the IFC.

“T think the IFC is being irresponsible,”’ said Vice
President Morgan Griffith at the hearings, and the
committee agreed to push the IFC for some commit-
ment, one way or the other.

What Ross got from the IFC were some reasonable
objections. IFC President Mason Ellerbe had a good
question: Does the IFC benefit especially from Con-
tact? How much prestige accrues to fraternities in the
form of positive publicity?

Once the IFC decides whether to support Contact,
the options are many and varied. The IFC could raise
the dues it charges its members and match the EC’s
$8,500 appropriation. The IFC could simply pay $7,500
as it did last year.

Ross also got a promise from Ellerbe — that the
IFC would make a decision by Tuesday, Oct. 19.

It’s no easy situation. But Contact is the IFC’s baby,
at least in theory. To back out drastically now, or to
hint publically at dropping Contact in the future
would tarnish what is already a not untarnished im-
age.

Video games seem to draw as many patrons as do the chicken burgers at Lloyd’s of Lexington. This
fast food restaurant has come a long way from its rocky start two years ago. (Phi photo by Eric Camp-
bell)

‘Lloyd’s’ climbs to success

By TED LECLERCQ
Special To The Phi

Lloyd’s of Lexington, that
chicken sandwich emporium,
might well be compared to Mec-
ca, the Saudi Arabian spritual
center. What other local site
draws as many students? At
two in the morning, after an in-
tense night of carousing, just
where are you likely to be?
Unless you’re down the road,
you’re probably at Lloyd’s.

Although many students
patronize this most convenient
establishment, few know the
brief but rocky beginnings of
Lloyd’s of Lexington.

Operating since November of
1980, Lloyd’s has become a focal
point for W&L late night munch-
ing. Yet for a year, Lloyd’s
teetered on the brink of finan-
cial disaster. During the first
two months, owner Lloyd Smith
spent 10,000 borrowed dollars to
get things going, and of that,
lost $6,000.

Things looked bleak, but, said
Lloyd, “I had something to pro-
ve to Hardee’s (former
employer) and to myself.’’

With a credit extension from
his food supplier and borrowing
against his car, Lloyd’s stayed
open.

“The banks wanted me to
shut my doors — I wouldn’t,”
Lloyd said. “The restaurant
was the Lord’s purpose (for
me).’’

Hanging in there with little
other than faith and resolve,
Lloyd has increased his gross
earnings some 650% in almost
two years. Yet, with his increas-
ed earnings, Lloyd’s overall
profit has remained relatively
modest.

As gross earnings have in-
creased, Lloyd has sought to
maintain the high quality of his
food. Unlike Hardee’s,
which uses frozen patties, the
hamburger meat at Lloyd’s is
bought fresh daily from the
White Front grocery, Lloyd
said.

Additionally, Lloyd’s roast
beef is sliced from a large rump
roast and is not “processed beef
with fillers” like that of his
competition, he said.

“One question that frequently
came up,” said Lloyd, ‘was
why I didn’t serve beer with
our food.’’ His two-part
response was that his lease
specifically prohibited it and
that most students are obnox-
ious enough as it is after a big

party without more beer.’
Although original sentiment felt
Lloyd’s would not make it
because he did not sell beer,
things have worked out because
most people are tired of drink-
ing when they finally make it
there.

In large part, these late night
munchers have made Lloyd’s a
success.

“The turning point, was when
we opened 24 hours a day,”
Lloyd said. Lloyd’s became the
only all-night restaurant in the
city.

The restaurant’s support has
come primarily from the W&L
student body.

“‘A local may sneak in, but
they know it’s W&L’s place
after five o’clock,”’ Lloyd said.

By far, his busiest hours are

from 12 to 3 a.m., on Thursday,
Saturday and Sunday morn-
ings.
. Lloyd’s will be celebrating its
second anniversary in Novem-
ber. With quality food and
unbeatable hours, Lloyd’s has
become the way to end the even-
ing. It’s almost chic to be seen
there at 3 a.m. What an asset to
trashed, starving, yet always
fashion-conscious W&L _ stu-
dents.

Cartoon sale starts today in Pit

“Eh, What’s up, Doc?”’

What’s up is the value of
animation cel paintings,
according to collectors of these
unusual fragments of American
popular culture.

More than 250 of these paint-
ings are the subject of a special
exhibit and sale. Washington &
Lee will host this event Thurs.
-Fri., Oct. 14-15, 1982 from 10
a.m. until 7 p.m. in the Univer-
sity Center (by the Cockpit).
The public is invited.

Animation cel paintings, call-
ed ‘‘cels,” are the paintings ac-
tually filmed in making ani-
mated cartoons. Each char-
acter is painted by hand on a
clear sheet of acetate, usually
11” x 14” or larger, then placed

against a background and pho-
tographed one-by-one to pro-
duce a reel of motion picture
film. Cels are the culmination of
the artistic process — the final
image that is photographed by
the camera.

A representative of Gallery
Lainzberg, the nation’s best-
known specialist in this unique
art form, will be on hand to
answer questions.

The Exhibit/Sale highlights
the work of two veteran Warner
Bros. _producer/directors:
Chuck Jones, creator of Wile E.
Coyote and the Roadrunner,
and Pepe le Pew; and Friz
Freleng, who created Tweety
and Sylvester, and brought
Yosemite Sam to life. Both
Jones and Freleng have been

cartooning for more than 50
years and both have been
honored with several Academy
Awards.

There will also be animation
cel paintings of their other crea-
tions — Bugs Bunny, Daffy
Duck and the Tasmanian Devil.
Some of these paintings have
been signed.

Of equal importance in the ex-
hibit is a collection of animation
cel paintings from some Walt
Disney films including ‘‘The
Jungle Book,’’ ‘‘Robin Hood,”
“Rescuers,” and ‘The Fox and
the Hound.” A selection of vin-
tage Disney animation draw-
ings from the 1930’s and 1940’s,
including a few choice drawings
of Mickey Mouse, will also be
offered.

Republicans roll

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Features Editor

A visit to campus Tuesday by
U.S. Congress hopeful Kevin
Miller kicked off a week of flur-
ried activities as Washington
and Lee’s fall campaign moved
into full swing.

The week culminated today
with a visit from Republican
Senate candidate Paul Trible
and a mock election.

Miller, a Republican hoping
to fill the seat being vacated by
the retirement of M. Caldwell
Butler, was officially in town
for the opening of Lexington’s
Republican headquarters, but
he spent several hours here on
campus.

A reception, press con-
ference, meeting with Presi-
dent Huntley, and a visit to the
blood drive were among the ac-
tivities that took place during
his time here.

Among the many comments
Miller made, the sharpest were
directed at Richard Davis, the
Democratic candidate for U.S.
Senate and a comment Davis
made last week in Alexandria.
Concerning social security,
Davis told a group of retired
citizens:

‘‘When the time comes for the
government to pay us back,
they ought to pay us back. I
don’t care where it comes from.
If that means tough luck for the
younger generation coming
along, that’s just tough luck.”

Miller said in response, ‘‘I
can’t believe he said that. He’s
made some silly statements,
but I think that one is totally ir-
responsible. If there’s anything
we need to do, it’s to restore
confidence in the social security
system.”

Miller also indicated that he
is pleased with the “clean”
election taking place here in the
6th district, and took time to
stress the different views on the
issues taken by him and his op-
ponent, Democrat James Olin.
Miller supports the third stage
of the federal tax decrease,
repeal of the Davis-Bacon act,
and adoption of a national right
to work law, all measures Olin
is opposed to.

Mock Election Today

The mock election today will
be the culmination of a week’s
work by both the College Re-
publicans and the Young Demo-
crats. Sponsored by the Wash-
ington and Lee Political
Review, the election is open this
afternoon until 5 p.m. The Dem-
ocrats have Olin and Davis on
the ballot for Congress and
Senate, respectively; the
Republicans have Miller and
Senate candidate Paul S. Tri-
ble.

Billy Price and the Keystone Rhythm Band’s first album is the
product of many performances and hard work.

Green Dolphin Records released the album ‘“‘Is it Over?”’ in 1980,
but somehow it has resurfaced just recently. Billy Price has been -
around for a long time and has certainly paid his dues. He grew up
in New Jersey, where he was influenced by the sounds of rhythm
and blues. People such as Bobby Bland, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, -
James Brown, and Jackie Wilson have made their mark on Billy
Price. In the late 1960s Price formed the Rhythm Kings who
became well-known throughout the New Jersey area.

He is probably best known for his work with guitarist Roy
Buchanan. Price was Buchanan’s lead vocalist on two albums and
toured the U.S. with him. Also a cover of Tyrone Davis’ ‘‘Can I
change My Mind” received considerable national airplay.

Review: Billy Price

In 1978 Billy Price formed the Keystone Rhythm Band, which has
become popular in Central and Western Pennsylvania, Washington
D.C., Virginia, Maryland, and the Southeast. The band has opened
for many well-known acts such as Muddy Waters, Southside
Johnny and Asbury Dukes, Greg Allman and The Nighthawks. The
Keystone Rhythm Band features Billy Price (vocals), Eric Leeds
(baritone saxophone), Jack Emminger (tenor saxophone), T.
Valentine (bass), Steve Binsberger (keyboards), Dave Dodd
(drums), and Keith Grimes (guitar). Also studio musicians Kenny
Blake (alto saxophone), Charles Roethal (guitar) and Don Garvin
(guitar and producer) contribute their talents to the album. The
components for a pure rhythm and blues band are surely within
this group.

The album opens with a classic R&B song, ‘‘Eldorado Cafe’ that
is carried by Price’s soulful voice and smooth combinations of the
alto and tenor sax. The second song ‘‘She’s Tough’”’ is about a
woman who “walked past the clock and the clock won’t tell time.”
Probably the highlight of the song is the laugh of Billy Price and the
smooth and perfect timing of the vocals and saxophones. The next
song is the title cut ‘‘Is It Over?’’ The last song of the first side is
“Slip Away’’; it is about the plea for his baby to slip away with him
for awhile. This song best exhibits Price’s ability to time and
phrase the words of a song.

The second side also contains good songs. (‘‘MaMa, Come Quick,
and Bring Your) Lickin’ Stick’’ is paced at a faster tempo and ac-
cented by a drum solo using brushes. ‘‘Please Send Me Someone To
Love’’ is a love ballad that is built around the remorseful sound of
the baritone saxophone. The last two songs “‘Steppin’ Up in Class”
and ‘‘Ace of Spades” are fast stepping soul classics.

If you like smooth-sounding rhythm and blues music this album
is one for your collection. Billy Price has been called ‘‘one of the
best rhythm and blues singers around’’ and the band was named
“Artist of the Year” in 1979 by a Pittsburgh Music Magazine. The

Budgets

(continued from page 1)
‘Realistically, we know we
can’t ask the EC for $19,000,”
Ron Magee of the Student
Association for Black Unity told
the EC Thursday night.
Originally, it was thought that
SABU was going to ask the EC
for $19,000 at the hearings. As it
turned out, this was the entire
budget and the organization
was only asking for $10,000.

The EC decided to try to meet
the need for minority-oriented
speakers and entertainment by
funding groups other than
SABU.

“It’s an interest we can meet
through a more careful direc-
tion of our other committees.
We can tell Contact, ‘‘you will
bring in one speaker agreed
upon with SABU,” Vlahoplus
said. In the end, the EC ap-
propriated $1,200 and stipulated
that SABU and Contact agree
on a speaker together. The vote
was unamimous.

With $59,872 left to ap-
propriate, the EC heard from
Kevin Brown and Luke Cor-
nelius of the Outing Club who
presented their ‘‘bare-bones
budget of $1,342.86.

Vice President Morgan Grif-
fith moved to appropriate $400
and Rep. Ken Terwilleger said
that he hoped the money would
be spent on ‘‘safety items.” The
$400 figure passed.

Contact
“We're ticked ... we’re ticked

o

at the Interfraternity Council
for one thing. We can’t be ex-
pected to foot the bill for every
committee,’ Ross exclaimed
about the Contact speakers
series. Contact was funded by
both the IFC and the EC.

But Thursday night the EC:

had no idea whether Contact
would get any money from the
IFC.

“The IFC is mismanaged to
begin with. We’ve got to get
some kind of permanent fun-
ding for Contact. I don’t know
what the solution is,’’ Ross said.

“It would be very nice for a
permanent fund system; I’m
just trying to cover the bases
for this year,’’ Mike Drinkwater
of the committee replied. The
general feeling among the EC
members seemed to be one of
wanting to cut the EC portion of
the Contact budget to force the
IFC to pull its fair share.

The IFC was not present.

‘Inherent in any motion is the
idea that we’re going after the
IFC,” Ross said after it was
moved that Contact be given
$8,500 of its requested $12,000.

‘‘What else do they do besides
pick up their trash? They
should want to do this — it’s
good PR for them,” Griffith
commented. The $8,500 figure
passed.

quested $12,309 but was told by

the EC that since the Publica-
tions Board had so much money
(over $7000) that The Phi’s
budget would be cut.

“IT don’t see why we should
give them that much when
they’ve got money in that
fund,’’ Terwilleger commented.

Griffith replied to his fellow
EC member, ‘The purse
strings control an awful lot. I
don’t think we have a right to
tell them to dip into their fund.”

Smith explained to the EC
that the purpose of the Publica-

quently, the Publications Board
also insulates The Phi from the

EC ponders parties, honor

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

Danny Einstein, president of
the Chi Psi Fraternity appeared
before the Executive Commit-
tee to explain his fraternity’s
role in the incident at the
Pavilion last Friday night and
to ask for the Committee’s sup-
port and help.

The fraternity sponsored a
party at Zollman’s Pavilion
which was raided by State
Police and sheriff’s deputies.
(See related story.)

“You do everything you can
to ensure that everyone knows
the ABC regulations and the
IFC can see that the fraternities
know them. We just want your
support,” Einstein told the EC
Monday night. The EC seemed
to agree that such support was
in order, and decided to draft a
vote of confidence.

“The police could come to
almost any party and nuke us,”
Senior Rep. John Vlahoplus
said, ‘‘If this is a precedent,
then we’ll have to start carding
people at Fancy Dress. It’s a
far-reaching thing.”’

The Committee also reviewed
a proposal from the faculty to
raise the distribution re-
quirements to 53 credits (ex-
cluding exemptions). This is not
so much an increase in number
as it is a more definite specifi-
cation of required courses.
Vlahoplus referred to this as
“legislating students into

courses.’’ The Committee plans
to talk to their constituents and
discuss the matter at the Oc-
tober 25 meeting. The faculty
will not vote on the proposed
changes until the November
meeting.

Markham Pyle, a_ junior,
presented the committee with a
set of proposed White Book revi-
sions. The committee reviewed
the revisions and discussed
them at length with Pyle and
other members of the student
body present at the meeting.
The consensus of the committee
was that the changes were too
drastic and would entail a com-
pletely different system from

 

the one currently employed.

Pyle said that he and others
were motivated to formulate
the revision because he
“gathered that there is a great
loss of confidence in the
system.”

Rep. Ken Terwilleger said
that he didn’t ‘‘see lack of con-
fidence as grounds for chang-
ing a system. ’’

President Bennett Ross
stated that the EC is ‘‘com-
mitted to making changes’”’ and
welcomed any other sugges-
tions for revision.

Ross also announced that
final budget approval will be
October 18.

$11,750, and Ross commented
that ‘$11,750 will say that we
realize the paper can be great. I
think the Pub Board would be
amenable to paying $600 or $700
for operating expenses.”

The SAB was the final
organization to come before the
EC. Lanier Edge, this year’s
chairman, ended up taking the
remainder of the funds and
some extra. In order for the EC

to give the SAB the predeter-
mined $40,000, it was necessary
to cut $200 from the SBA budget,
$50 from the Political Review,
$50 from the Calyx. The SAB
ended up with $40,022. Ross
closed the meeting, saying,
“There is no money anywhere
else.”

These appropriations are only
tentative, pending final EC ap-
proval October 18.

Washburn shifts

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer

In September the University
announced the formation of a
new group to develop and pro-
mote long-range giving and
estate plans of Washington and
Lee alumni and friends.

As part of that plan William
C. Washburn, executive secre-
tary of Washington and Lee
Alumni, Inc. will step aside to
become an associate director of
development in the new group.

‘“‘My responsibility will be to
assist the development office in
promoting and advertising (to
Washington and Lee alumni)
the whole field of estate plan-
ning and deferred giving,”
Washburn said Tuesday. He
described his new post as a ‘‘dif-
ferent phase of the same kind of
work.”’

Washburn, 64, joined the ad-
ministration in 1958 as Alumni
Secretary. “It was a public
relations position to develop
and maintain alumni chapters
throughout the country,’ he
said. In addition to the alumni
chapters, Washburn was re-
sponsible for directing and rais-
ing the Alumni Fund until that
job was taken over by the
development office in 1968.

According to a recent article
in the W&L Alumni Magazine,
the number of alumni chapters
has doubled under Washburn’s
guidance. Reunion programs
have been expanded, and alum-
ni travel opportunities  in-
stituted during his tenure. The
creation of the Special Alumni
Conference, the Distinguished
Alumni Award, the Summer
Alumni College and the con-
struction of the Alumni House
came under Washburn’s leader-
ship.

Washburn has seen changes
at Washington and Lee since he
first came here as a freshman
in 1936. In the late 1930s most
students did not have cars,
everyone wore coats and ties,
and Saturday classes were no
big deal. Now, almost 50 years

Tennyson

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

Approximately 200 people at-
tended the inauguration of the
Shannon-Clark lecture series in
English in Lee Chapel Monday
night. Dr. Edgar Finley Shan-
non, Commonwealth Professor
of English at the University of
Virginia, honorary vice presi-
dent of the Tennyson Society,
and a 1939 graduate of W&L,
spoke on the superhuman
aspirations expressed in Alfred,
Lord Tennyson’s poetry.

After greetings by Dr. Sidney
Coulling, chairman of _ the
department of English, and an
introduction by President
Robert Huntley, Shannon, past
UVapresident, noted that ‘‘my
father and especially my
mother’. would be honored .by

later Washington and Lee has
changed for the better, Wash-
burn said. And it is a change in
which he has been instrumental
as executive secretary of
Washington and Lee Alumni,
Inc.

“Physical changes on the
campus, certainly in the last ten
years, have been magnificent”
Washburn said. ‘‘For a student
today the facilities available
are much better than they were
for a student in my day.”’

Washburn, takes no credit for
himself for the success of the 10-
year capital development pro-
gram guided by President
Robert E.R. Huntley. ‘‘The suc-
cess of that program has been
due to the magnetic personality
of Bob Huntley,’’ Washburn
said, “‘and to the whole idea of
this 10-year development pro-
gram we have been in.”’

But the contribution of Bill
Washburn to the development
of Washington and Lee has been
substantial. In his own words,
“The alumni office has been out
in the grass roots, cultivating
the seeds of support for the
university.”

With regard to student life,
Washburn has seen a metamor-
phosis from the straight-laced
style of the late 1930s through
the radical sixties to the pro-
gressive age of the 1980s. Upon
returning to Washington and
Lee in 1958 to become Alumni
Secretary Washburn said.
“What struck me was the
number of students that had
automobiles.

“There was no. other
outstanding change, except the
students seemed more mobile
than in the late thirties.’ he
said

Gradually though, the con-
cept of “going down the road”
changed to “giris coming over
here.”’ Washburn said.

“There are more occasions
now for the young ladies to
come to Lexington than there
were in my day,” he said.

“There have been many

gears

changes in the fraternity and
non-fraternity system.’ he
said. “On the bad side, the
deterioration of the houses was
bound to come.

‘The students went through a
period where their attitudes
towards their property and
others’ property was not as sen-
sitive as it was in my day,”’ said
Washburn, who was a W&L Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
member. “‘But that attitude is
changing now; the students are
much more sensitive to proper-
ty rights.”

Washburn also noted a trend
of students moving from frater-
nities to apartments in town.

‘‘When I was in school a stu-
dent looked forward to being a
senior so he could live in the
house.”” Washburn said. Now
most fraternity members do
their time in the house as
sophomores and move on.

“The national trend of subur-
bia hit all college campuses and
it became the accepted thing to

have apartments,” he said.

“That had something. to do
with the ‘modus operandi’ of the
ladies,’”’ Washburn said.

‘Ladies were once required
to stay in approved rooming
houses,’’ he said. ‘Now they
can stay wherever they want.”

As for academics at Washing-
ton and Lee, several things
have changed during Wash-
burn’s time. Notably, the Satur-
day classes which were dropped
in the late 1960s and the addi-
tion, in the mid 1970s of the
short spring semester.

When Saturday classes were
dropped, Washburn said,
“There was some feeling at the
time that it would be detrimen-
tal to intramural sports.”

“T don’t think that was
generally true,” he said.

The addition of the short term
in the spring has been ac-
cepted as good both by the
students and the faculty.”
Washburn said.

Next year a new grading
system will allow teachers to

 

“Yes, what can I do for you?” says retiring Alumni secretary
Bill Washburn, who has three notepads on his desk to handle the in-
coming calls. Washburn will move into the directorship of a new
group which promotes long-range giving and estate planning. (Phi

give students plus or minus
grades allowing a greater flex-
ibility in assigning term marks.
“I would think it will be good to
allow greater flexibility,” he
said.

The prospects for the future
of W&L are bright, Washburn
said. ‘Assuming no catastro-
phic economic problems, I envi-
sion Washington and Lee’s
future as very healthy.”

‘“‘We can expect our people to
support us the way they always
have,’’ he said.

Washburn graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1940 with
a B.A. in Economics. After
graduation, he went straight to
work for the ship building divi-

sion of Bethlehem Steel in New
York City.

“Because I was in a war
manufacturing company, I was
deferred from service in the
military until Oct. 1943,”’ he
said. He was then drafted into
the Navy as a supply officer.

After being discharged by the
Navy in 1946, he returned to his
home state of Alabama to work
for the Gulf States Paper Cor-
poration in Tuscaloosa.

After another brief stint with
the Navy as a procurement of-
ficer during the Korean War,
Washburn went back to the
paper company for a few years
before coming to Washington
and Lee.

scholar kicks off new lecture series

the lecture series bearing his
father’s name.

In his lecture, the renowned
scholar remarked that men
“wish to transcend the limita-
tion of their humanity.” This
“continuing crisis of the spirit’’
is shown constantly throughout
Tennyson’s poetry. Tracing the
development of _ this
superhuman theme from one of
Tennyson’s first poems, ‘‘Ar-
mageddon,’’ to his last, “In
Memorium,”’ Shannon told the
audience that Tennyson, while
realizing that the human could
not become divine, believed
man could elevate his spirit and
transcend time and death by
practicing unselfish and selfless
love.

Taking the title of his work
from. Tennyson’s final poem,

Shannon explained that ‘the
Thews of Anakim,”’ the title of
his lecture, alluded to the
Biblical inhabitants of Canaan
whose extraordinary size and
might (‘“‘Thews” refers to mus-
cle or sinewy tissue) made
them appear as superhuman to
the Israelis.

Earlier in the day, Shannon
had lectured the English staff
and students interested in
British or American literature
on Tennyson at the University’s
Blue Ridge estate, Skylark.
Shannon, after reviewing Ten-
nyson’s life, works, and theme,
surprised those present by play-
ing copies of original recordings
of Tennyson reading his own
poetry.

“The lecture series is design-
ed to give interested students

and faculty the chance to talk
with an eminent scholar in an
informal atmosphere,” said
Coulling, adding that the series
is designed for a two-day visit
and lecture period. ‘‘The lec-
ture was beautifully worked
out. We in the department are
pleased to see (the series)
begun.”

The lecture series, privately
endowed by an anonymous
donor, takes its name from
Edgar Finley Shannon, chair-
man of W&L’s department of
English from 1914 to 1938 and
father of the series’ first lec-
turer, and Harriet M.F. Clark, a
grandmother to the anonymous
donor and advocate of liberal
arts education. Only one lec-
turer will speak per academic
year under the series name.

 

Dr. Edgar F. Shannon

Coulling noted that the donor re-
mains anonymous in hope that
others will endow departments
in the university for similar
liberal arts lecture series.

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

On the shelf above a cluttered
desk in the Chemistry depart-
ment, there sits a worn binder
with yellowed pages of poetry
between its covers. The first
work is entitled “‘Cups,’’ and it’s
signed by James K. Shillington.

“Cups” was written by a
young man aspiring to the fine
arts, and creative writing and

‘ teaching especially. But a col-

lege professor warned him
about the tedium of reading
other people’s work.

Instead, Shillington became a
chemist and a teacher. Now, he
is a legend among W&L’s pre-
med students and alumni, and a
figure highly respected by
fellow science professors.

“He makes you work hard
from day one, but you learn
Organic chemistry,’”’ a fellow
faculty member said. ‘And
your grades equal the work put
in, That means, in his case, that
(the grades) must be above
average.”

Shillington is not the average
professor. Usually seen bedeck-
ed in stripes or loud colors, and
he always wears a fishing hat
adorned by sunglasses, iden-
tification card and a poppy.

“The cartoon in The Phi
(Sept. 28) didn’t show the poppy
in my hat. They de-poppified
my hat,’’ Shillington said. ‘I
guess that’s the same as
deflowering it,’’ he said.

Shillington can be inscrutable
at times, and his conversation
intermingles dry wit, joviality
and seriousness. He refers to
his teaching as ‘interfering
with people.”’

By ‘‘interfering,” Shillington
said he meant ‘making lives
hectic.”’

Shillington interupted a re-
cent interview to shout lab in-
structions to students through-
out the lab. That may be unor-
thodox, but it is pure Shill-
ington.

“When he comes to some-
thing he really wants you to
know, he makes sure you catch
it,” said one pre-med student.
“‘He’d say, ‘This binds to this,
THIS BINDS TO THIS! THIS
BINDS TO THIS!!!”

And yet, “interfering” also
means enjoying seeing students
learn.

“] don’t know why one
teaches, but I like it,’’ Shill-
ington said.

He is dedicated to his science,
and hates to see it get the ‘‘short
shift.” ‘I believe science (train-
ing) should be started earlier in
life. . . .Most students, however,
don’t take science until high
school, probably in their last
year or two,” he said.

As he flipped through a lab
manual, Shillington lamented
the University’s “liberal arts”
label. ‘‘Liberal arts is not a pro-
per name for the degree or cur-
riclum. It cheats science.
‘Arts,’ by definition, points to
the humanities,’’ he said.

-These are hardly the words
one might expect from Shill-
ington, who as an Iowa farmboy
dreamed of being a poet. (He
also considered being a florist,
and his lab is brightened by the
healthy plants nestled in every
window of his lab.)

Shillington pursued his
writing in college, joining a club
where he wrote something
“every other week. We sat
around and critiqued each
other’s works.’’ He composed
sonnets, poems and tributes un-
til ‘‘I burned out at 40.

“Everyone burns out at 40,”
he said.

But it is hard to think of Shill-
ington as ‘‘burnt out.”’ Active in
theater all his life, Shillington
will portray Cardinal Wolsey in
next week’s W&L production of
‘‘A Man for All Seasons.”

In addition, he collects fine
art, reads, gardens and cooks.

In his home garden, Shill-
ington grows ‘‘a few flowers
and some vegetables, like ‘to-
mahhhtoes.’ In Virginia, we say
‘trahhhsh basket’ and ‘to-
mahhhtoes’ and ‘plahhhster
cast’. Not ‘Plahhhster
cahhhst,’” he quipped.

Shillington turns enigmatic
when one questions why an
academically accomplished
chemist like him would stay at a
small school. ‘I’ve stayed here.
Why? I don’t know. They’ve
decided I could stay here,” he
said, pointing in the direction of
the Colonnade and its ad-
ministration offices.

Since he began teaching at
Washington and Lee in 1953,
Shillington has seen the rules
relaxed. The informality of the
last ten to fifteen years is
perhaps the most obvious dif-
ference.

“Oh God, has it changed. The
school was much more rigorous
and formal then,”’ he said. ‘‘Do
you still observe a speaking
tradition? Must you still wear a
coat and tie? We have had a
violent change,”’ he said.

 

Under the dress code, stu-
dents had to wear coat and tie to
lab. “In the Chemistry depart-
ment, we had to petition the ad-
ministration or order to allow
students to change before lab,”
said Shillington (who was wear-
ing no tie). ‘“‘They brought their
change of clothing, and we
changed out in the hall.”’

Student dress may have
changed, but for Shillington the
students have remained the
same academically.

“T’ve not noticed much dif-
ference, though I have had pre-
meds mainly. They are terribly
hard workers and always have
been,” he said. “I like the
students, though they don’t
think so.”

A student survey in the 70s
ranked Shillington as the third
most popular professor.
Students still look forward to
the halftime of Homecoming,
when Shillington bestows a kiss
on the Queen.

Popularity notwithstanding,
Shillington is tough with his
students’ conduct in and out of
class. He distributes warnings
that if he finds a pre-med in-
volved in fraternity hazing, he
will note it in the pre-med’s
recommendation to medical
school. And pre-meds attach a
lot of importance to the Shill-
ington Recommendation.

“‘T hate hazing. No ‘doctor-to-
be’ can be that inhuman, I tell
my students,”’ he said.

“As I tell my students, I have
a heart of gold.

“But it melts at 170¢
degrees,’’ he quipped.

Asked to describe himself,
Shillington offers another
enigma.

“I don’t know how to describe
myself. That’s not easy. I think
of myself as rolling around in-
side a large envelope,” he mut-
tered, his hands folded together
and his eyes staring straight
ahead.

‘Will that do?”’

were only one-third of what we
exported to Switzerland or
Austria ... We would not be able
to be blackmailed by the Soviet
Union.”’

In this connection Weiss men-

 

 

 

 

 

tioned the construction of the
pipeline between the Soviet
Union and Western Europe. For
West Germany, a_ country
which must import all of its
natural gas and oil, Russia is
the cheapest source of one of
those resources, natural gas.
The Soviet Union, included
Weiss, is a very reliable trading
partner. However, based on
fears that profits Russia will
make from its sale of natural
gas would be used to further in-
crease its military strength,
President Reagan imposed
sanctions on those Italian,
Japanese, French, English, and
West German companies which
continued to supply products for
the pipeline construction.

Weiss called this a “‘breach of
law because Reagan made
these sanctions applicable to

contracts made two years ago.
We certainly do not want the
United States to determine our
trade policy, (especially) in a
retroactive way.”

Weiss expressed his faith that
this problem can be solved, but
emphasized the danger of weak-
ening America’s ties with
Western Europe. ‘‘If we can be
cut off, without being warned
beforehand, from using Ameri-
can technology, which we pay
for, in our relations with other
nations, then we will do without
it.

‘‘We (the NATO members)
are a family,” concluded Weiss.
“Tf you had a sister, would you
force her to do something she
did not want to do?’’ Unfor-
tunately, Weiss said, President
Reagan told West Germany
what to do.

W&L caps off
‘building’ years

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

For the first time in 14 years,
the freshman class at W&L will
not become accustomed to a
campus with major reconstruc-
tion underway.

The only work scheduled for
this year, according to Mr.
Frank Parsons, Assistant to
President Huntley and, since
June, University Editor, is the
minor electrical work yet to be
done on new lights being install-
ed throughout the campus.

“We’re pretty much caught
up as far as renovations are
concerned,” Parsons said in a
recent interview, noting that on-
ly the Steinheimer house near
the Co-op and the no. 32 house
next to the alumni house await
work.

Since President Huntley took
office in 1968, the university has
undergone $36 million worth of
renovation. The aggressive re-
construction program saw the
law school, library, and Warner
Center built, with extensive
remodeling occuring in the
School of Commerce, Tucker,
Reid, and Newcomb Halls and
other buildings.

The majority of the funds us-
ed in the projects came from
alumni gifts and other dona-
tions.

The most recent renovation,
and perhaps the most visible to
the freshman, is the Graham-
Lees Dormitory. Begun in June
1981, the project costing $3.5
million including new fur-
nishings. Finished ahead of
schedule this past June, Gra-
ham-Lees was used for summer
lacrosse and basketball camps.

With the removal of construc-
tion equipment used in the dor-
mitory project came the resur-
facing and landscaping of the

parking lot in front of the
Doremus Gymnasium. In addi-
tion to the $135,000 paving and
resurfacing costs is the cost of
new lighting fixtures for the
area.

“The lighting was bought in a
package deal,’”’ Parsons noted.
“The lights for the parking lot,
the walkway between the main
halls and the library, and in
front of the houses on the front
campus were paid for at one
price.”’

Parsons said the lights near
the library are being installed
because of the lack of light shed
by the other halls in the vicinity
at night. When the architect
recommended that no addi-
tional lighting be installed on
the path during the construction
of the library, it was believed
the light given from classrooms
in the halls where students
would be studying, coupled with
the reflecting lights set in the
ground at the center.of the
walkway islands, would be suf-
ficient.

Few students, however, have
made use of the classrooms,
and the lights are being install-
ed to brighten the area. Studies
are also being made for addi-
tional lighting near Parmley,
Howe, and duPont Halls.

Future plans for renovations
on campus include the possible
conversion of a University-
owned train station south of
campus into a new theater
freshman dormitory near there.
Parsons also said the tennis
courts under the footbridge
may be resurfaced for all-
weather use like the ones above
the stadium, though adding that
any plans are only tentative un-
til new President John D.
Wilson takes office in January.

the Lee Chapel crowd with his
authoritative mastery of the
keys at the end of the
Rachmaninoff selection. He
captivated the audience as he
stood to play the final few notes.

Mr. Silverman selected an ex-
cellent combination of pieces to
perform. They were selections
which were both familiar
enough to many of the students
to keep their interest and
challenging enough for those in
the audience who were more
knowledgeable in music. As a
result, many of the students and
others in the audience heard
music which they could enjoy
while also appreciating the
tremendous talent behind it.

Mr. Stewart and the Concert
Guild board is to be commended
for arranging such an excellent
opening performance for the
1982 Concert Guild season. The
next concert will be Dec. 2 at
Lee Chapel with the Boehm
Woodwind Quintette.

Scores three touchdowns

 

By ANDREW P. HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Senior halfback Chris
Cavalline rushed for 120 yards
and three touchdowns to lead
the Washington and Lee football
team to a 28-14 victory Saturday
at Maryville College in
Maryville, Tennessee.

W&L’s victory, which boosted
the Generals’ record to 3-1
overall and 3-0 in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference,
was particularly impressive be-
cause W&L played without the
services of junior quarterback
Al Paradise.

Paradise missed the game
with a sprained ankle.

Sophomore John Thompson
filled in admirably though,
completing 8 of 11 passes for 137
yards. ‘‘He missed on his first
two attempts. Then he settled
in. He came through with about
six consecutive completions,’
noted W&L head coach Gary
Fallon.

Senior Phil Hrabar also had
an excellent day. Hrabar had
five receptions for 79 yards, in-
cluding a 35-yarder that set up a
W&L touchdown.

Maryville opened the scoring,
though, on a 27-yard pass from
Pat O’Brien to Gene Wheatley.
O’Brien passed for 191 yards on
the afternoon, but was in-
tercepted twice by the W&L
defense.

W&L regained the lead with

two long touchdown drives,.one
of 80 yards and the other of 58
yards, to take a 14-7 lead into
the locker room. Cavalline
notched the first score on a 1-
yard plunge and freshman
Frank Surface scored from
three yards out with 1:15 left in
the half to complete the second
drive.

“Offensively we’ve been pret-
ty good as a group. We’ve allow-
ed our backs and quarterbacks
to perform,”’ said Fallon.

W&L and Maryville exchang-
ed lightning quick scores in the
third quarter. Pat O’Brien hit
Glenn Katz with a 47-yard bomb
to tie the score at 14-14 at 10:36
of the third quarter. Chris
Cavalline moved W&L back in
front 24 seconds later, when he
broke loose for a 63-yard touch-
down run. It was the longest
touchdown run of Cavalline’s
career.

W&L added an _ insurance
touchdown at 12:10 of the final
period on another one yard run

 

by Cavalline. Cavalline’s score
capped an 86 yard drive.

The insurance score proved
unnecessary as, for the second
week in a row, the W&L defense
blanked the opposition in the
fourth quarter. Senior Marty
Thomas had a strong game with
two interceptions and junior
John Cole, the teams’ leading
tackler, also intercepted a pass.

Fallon.

happen. We've been letting

Fallon said.

Starting quarterback Al

“Last week we thought he
might have been able to play.
It’s still a day to day thing,”
said Fallon.

Mid-terms looking good

by G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Sports Editor

As mid-terms close in rapidly
upon us, let’s take a look at the
mid-term grades for the various
Washington and Lee fall sports
teams.

Prior to yesterday’s soccer
match with Gettysburg, the
four teams had compiled an

Harriers win two,

The Washington and Lee
cross-country team improved
their record to 6-1 with two vic-
tories Saturday in Washington,
D.C.

Junior Angus McBryde, the
Generals’ top runner so far
throughout the season, suffered
a mid-race tumble and had to
settle for a fourth-place finish.
However, sophomore Frank
Pittman picked up the slack by
placing third in a time of 26:18.

The Generals downed Catho-
lic 26-29 and American Univer-
sity 26-43. Senior Jon Kelafant
placed sixth, junior Paul Chap-
man seventh and freshman Bob
Glenn eleventh to round out the
Washington and Lee top five.

Fourteen seven-man cross-
country teams from around the
state will invade Lexington this
weekend for the third annual
Virginia Division II and III
Championships. The race,
which will be run on W&L’s 8000
meter course, will get under-
way at 11 a.m. Saturday.

Division II teams competing
will be Hampton Institute,
Liberty Baptist, Norfolk State,
Radford, Virginia Union and

Division III teams in town
will be Bridgewater, Christo-

overall record of 27-7-1, a 79%
winning percentage.
One of the chief contributors

to that record was the water -

polo team, coached by Page
Remillard. With a 14-4 mark,
this year’s squad should do at
least as well as that of last year,
which finished 31-5 and fifth in
the NCAA Eastern Champion-
ships.

Although all-Americans Erik
Peterson and Rand McClain are
leading the way for the mermen
(sorry, coach!), as expected,
there have been several plea-
sant surprises for the few who

happen to wander by Twombly °

Pool.

Junior Matt Ravencraft, who
had really only seen limited ac-
tion in previous years, worked
hard over the summer at the
National Junior Development
Camp and the National Sports
Festival, and has scored 47
goals already this season.

And a freshman from Miami
by the name of Tim Stanford,
whom Remillard describes as
“‘coachable,” has scored 24

goals coming off the bench.
These new developments, cou-
pled with the performances of
Peterson and McClain, ought to
give the Generals a reasonable
shot at upsetting Slippery Rock
this weekend at the Bucknell
Tournament.

The Washington and Lee
cross-country team has compil-
ed a 6-1 record to this point in
the season and will be hosting
their biggest race of the year
this Saturday in the Virginia
State Division II and III cham-
pionships.

Led by Angus McBryde,
Frank Pittman and Jon Kela-
fant, the squad has shown that it
can compete with other top
teams, including a crucial vic-
tory over Roanoke College two
weekends ago.

And even when McBryde
doesn’t perform up to par, as in
Saturday’s race in Washington,
D.C., when McBryde suffered a
tumble mid-way through the
race, other runners can pick up
the slack. In that particular
race, it was Pittman who finish-

(continued on page 11)

Seniors lead soccer win

It was a day for seniors last
Saturday as three Washington
and Lee seniors led the soccer
team to a 3-1 victory over home-
standing Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege.

Brad Poorman, Tom Elder,
and Gary Clements scored one
goal apiece as Washington and
Lee upped their record to 4-1-1.
Poorman’s goal marked the
fifth consecutive game in which
he has scored.

Elder’s goal was assisted by

senior Tad Renner, and Cle-
ment’s score was aided by an

 

assist from Poorman.

Clements and defensive
standout John Templeton, a
freshman, were named players
of the game. Poorman now
leads the squad in scoring with
eight goals and an assist for 17
points.

Washington and Lee, which
now has a 2-1-1 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record, out-
shot Hampden-Sydney 30-11.
Following a home match with
Gettysburg yesterday, the

Generals will travel to Messiah
College on Saturday.

Water polo destroys league competition

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
water polo Generals finished
another productive weekend as
they swept the field to take the
championship in the Southern
League’s Zone I competition,
upping their record to 14-4.

Finishing behind the Gener-
als were James Madison (3-1),
Lynchburg (2-2), George Wash-
ington (1-3), and VMI (0-4).

Coach Page Remillard was
relatively content with the
Generals’ weekend. ‘We’re
happy about our defense,”
stated Remillard, referring to
an area of concern from the
previous weekend.

ed third to pace the Generals.
This year’s Washington and
Lee football team seems to be
almost an exact carbon-copy of
last year’s squad. Like last
season, the team got off to a
slow start, squeaking by Emory
and Henry and Randolph-
Macon and losing to Centre.
However, despite injuries to

just 50% of their opponents’
shots.

Offensively, the Generals are,
according to Coach Remillard,
“an excited team.” The fourth-
year mentor continued, citing
an increased ‘‘diversity in
generating our attack.” Statis-
tics bear this team offense con-
cept out, with W&L having
seven or eight scorers in each of
the weekend’s contests.

The Generals also had the
luxury to do a little freelancing,
but given this freedom, Remil-
lard saw his team work their set
offense even better.

The use of two movie
cameras during the weekend
was also beneficial. Remillard

 

Before yesterday’s game, the
Generals boasted a 4-1-1 record,
and senior Brad Poorman was
the leading scorer with eight
goals and one assist. With a lit-
tle bit of luck, this could be a
spectacular season for W&L
soccer.

THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR

They opened Friday afternoon
with a 15-3 romp over neighbor
VMI. Things continued in much
the same manner on Saturday
as W&L closed out the competi-
tion with wins over Lynchburg
(15-1), JMU (16-6), and George
Washington (18-4).

Remillard cited a trio of the
team’s younger members as
key to the Generals’ perfor-
mance. Freshmen Tim Stan-
ford and Scott Johnstone along
with sophomore Bobby Pearson
turned in noteworthy perfor-
mances with solid mental
games and important offensive
output.

Junior Matt Ravencraft led
the squad with 17 goals for the

Tourney. The Generals will be
searching for revenge again as
they meet Navy and Bucknell
—both two-goal victors over
W&L earlier in the season —
and, of course, Slippery Rock,
the nemesis of the past two

seasons.

last meeting with the Generals

“It’s the kind of contest I look
