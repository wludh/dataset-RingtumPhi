EC doubles
budget hearings

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

Rather than have one budget hearing reach into the wee hours of
the morning, the EC decided Monday to split that hearing into two
separate sessions.

One session was held Wednesday night. The second begins
tonight at 6:30 p.m.

Junior representative Scott Mason explained his reasoning for
voting in favor of the motion, saying “‘it looks better to do it in two
nights.”

Vice President Morgan Griffith also emphasized this point, but
defended last year’s method with the comment that ‘‘we didn’t
make any wrong decisions last year.”’

Most of the requests were heard Wednesday night, with the re-
mainder to be heard tonight.

President Bennett Ross cited larger budget requests from some
clubs as one reason for the move. For example, Ross said, the Stu-
dent Association for Black Unity is requesting $19,000 this year.

Steve Metrazzo appeared on behalf of the Mock Convention com-
mittee to explain that the committee did not want to request money
now, but wished the E.C. to bear in mind their sizeable budget. The
committee had wanted an increase in the amount of student taxes
set aside for it. Last week, the E.C. set aside $5 per student.

“I question the rationale of setting aside $7.50 when we really
don’t have any idea of what things cost,” Ross said.

The Mock Convention committee budget ‘“‘liberalized’’ expenses
and listed incomes conservatively, Mock Convention officers said.

Newly-elected freshman law representative John Sicilian
brought up the subject of the Fancy Dress Weekend date again,
particulary the method of choosing the date. He called it ‘‘ass-
backwards to check other schools’ schedules,” before checking the
schedule at the law school.

Ross reminded him that the College is all-male and that Fancy
Dress depends on W&L men getting dates from area women’s col-
leges for the most part.

The EC also announced that it is welcoming students to submit
proposals for revising the White Book and/or the Constitution.
Copies of both are available in Carole Chapell’s office in the Student

Two held for beating, stabbing of local man

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Jack Roberson, a_ life-long
resident of Lexington who was
beaten and stabbed in his home
Sunday night, is in stable condi-
tion at Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital. Two juvenile suspects are
in custody awaiting trial.

L.E. Richardson, Executive
Vice President of the hospital,
said Mr. Roberson was brought
to the emergency room with a
stab wound and was put in in-
tensive care for treatment.
Citing hospital policy, he refus-
ed to provide any additional
details.

A member of the hospital
staff who asked not to be iden-
tified said of Mr. Roberson, ‘‘He
has suffered multiple injuries
and at present his condition is
satisfactory.”” The man con-
firmed that Mr. Roberson had
been removed from the inten-
sive care unit Tuesday morn-
ing. He said there is no indica-
tion as to how long Mr. Rober-
son will need to remain hospi-
talized.

Acting Chief of Police for Lex-

ington Lieutenant Bruce M.
Beard said that two young white
males came to Mr. Roberson’s
door at about 5:30 p.m. Sunday
and asked for a glass of water.
As he went to get the water, the
two followed him into the house,
where the assault took place.

Hospital records show that
Mr. Roberson was admitted at
5:55 p.m. Lieutenant Beard said
Roberson was treated for stab
wounds to the left side of his
chest, lacerations to his throat
and the palm of his left hand,
and lacerations to his left ear.

According to Beard, a fifteen-
and a sixteen-year-old youth,
both residents of Lexington, are
being held as suspects in the
case at the Shenandoah Valley
Detention Home. Because they
are minors, their names have
not been released.

One of the suspects cut
himself in the alleged attack on
Roberson and was taken to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital for
treatment by a passerby in an
automobile. There he was taken
into custody. Beard says that
led them to the second suspect,

who was arrested at his home.

The state police mobile crime
lab was immediately called to
the scene of the crime. Lex-
ington police officers Charles
Carpenter and David Rhoden-
izer are investigating the at-
tack, and Beard says he expects
the investigation will continue
for about another week. He said
the resources of the police
department have been fully
utilized in the wake of the stabb-
ing because ‘‘this is a major
event for a community this
size.”

Beard added that charges
have not yet been filed against
the youths, but will be very
shortly.

A hearing regarding the case
was held Tuesday morning at
the Juvenile and Domestic Re-
lalations Court. Because the
suspects are juveniles, the
hearing was closed.

Officer Carpenter, who repre-
sented the police department at
the hearing, said that ‘‘we prov-
ed there is probable cause for
detention based on what they
were alleged to have done and

on their criminal
records.”

Carpenter said a hearing will
be held Monday to determine
whether the suspects will be
tried as adults or stand trial
with juvenile status. The trial
will take place at the Rock-
bridge County Courthouse in
Lexington.

Mr. Roberson, 66, is well-
known in town for his interest in
antiques. He lives alone in Mid-
dleton House, one of the oldest
homes in the city, across the
street from the fire department
at 111 South Jefferson.

His sister, Elizabeth P.
Keevan of Alexandria, was call-
ed into town Monday. She called

prior

the attackers ‘‘two young
hoodlums’’ and_ ‘‘vicious
monsters.”

“I certainly hope that these
people are taken proper care of
in regard to being taken off the
street.... I hope they’re pro-
secuted and put away,” she
said.

After visiting Roberson Tues-
day she said that he is in ‘‘ex-
cellent spirits.... He is lucid and

clear as a bell.”” Mrs. Keevan
said ‘‘his improvement from
yesterday is amazing.” She
continued, ‘‘I can’t believe he’s
been hit over the head and
beaten and everything else.”’

She said that his ear is par-
tially cut off, and that apparent-
ly the attackers tried to sever it
completely. Mrs. Keevan says
Roberson had seen one of the
assailants before, but did not
know the other. One of them had
come to the door earlier
because he was ‘‘willing to do
work.”’ Mr. Roberson apparent-
ly declined the offer.

Mrs. Keevan said her brother
“was a gentle, kind person who
never would harm a soul.”’ She
said Roberson was a small
man, and that the attackers
‘just took advantage of an
elderly person.”

“He was not in the best of
health,’”’ she said. ‘‘He had a
stroke several years ago and
lost the full use of his left side.”’

She said she’s gotten ‘‘dozens
and dozens”’ of calls from well-

It could happen to anyone

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Features Editor

A shock wave ripped across a complex web of
friends and family when a car carrying three VMI
cadets and two Randolph-Macon women crashed
Saturday morning, Sept. 25.

Part of the web was the younger brother of Danny
Lawless. He looked up to his Cadet brother with
pride. Danny was an Electrical Engineering major
on a Navy Scholarship. A second classman, he had
become a member of the VMI wrestling team as a
rat. He enjoyed shagging. On Saturday morning,
Sept. 22, the younger brother learned that his big
brother was dead.

Jim Bogosian was affectionately called Bogo by
his Brother Rats. Like Lawless, he was on the
Dean’s Honor List at VMI. A Navy ROTC scholar
and a German major, Jim was a Cadet Sergeant
and member of the tennis team. He loved horses,
spending his free time training them. His sister,
was traveling in Europe when the shock came from
her parents in Michigan. Her brother was dead.

On Tuesday night, Sept. 28, Stan Ross became the
third cadet and fourth person to die from the
catastrophic accident. He lived in room 265 at VMI
with Jim and Danny; indeed, they were not only
roomates but Brother Rats in the true sense of the
words. Enrolled in Air Force ROTC, Stan was presi-
dent of the International Relations Club and a
member of the Hop Committee (like W&L’s SAB).
Stan’s parents received the tragic news only months
after adopting a two and one-half year old child.

The fourth victim was Margaret N. Abbitt of Ran-
dolph-Macon Woman’s College. She was from New-
port News, Va. Also in the car was Diane Ellain
Doggett, whose injuries were not fatal.

Analysis

By now, all W&L students have heard about the
accident on Route 11 just north of Lexington. But for
many of us the shock wave never really hit. The
cadets remain faceless strangers in uniforms. They
died, some might casually think, because it was
“their time.”

But these were students like us — our peers and
our brothers. It might have well been us and not
them in that car. J

Virginia Military Institute’s chaplain, Col.
Charles Caudill, hopes both VMI and W&L students
will realize that. The human web of caring should
entwine both campuses.

No Washington & Lee student was present at
either of the two memorial services held at VMI,
Caudill said.

‘“‘W&L and VMI are so close, we need to get to
know each other more,” said Chaplain Caudill.
“Everybody who travels on that highway needed to
have come, just because they care. We’re not talk-
ing about ‘‘others,”’ we’re talking about ourselves.
It would have been meaningful to us if some W&L
students would have been there.

‘“‘We need to develop a feeling of caring. If W&L
had been the one holding a memorial service for
students, I hope VMI would care. If two students,
one from VMI and one from W&L, had been in the
car, I don’t know if there would have been a joint
service. It would be interesting to see what would
happen. I don’t know,” Chaplain Caudill continued.

He compared W&L and VMI to two families living
next door to each other. If two brothers in one fami-
ly died, he said, the other family would be concern-
ed.

“‘Let’s suffer together and rejoice together,’’ he
continued, quoting scripture. He explained that in
his four years at VMI, there have been “‘no social
events or cultural events to recognize we even exist
side by side.”’

Chaplain Caudill explained that he has seen
growth between the Christian communites on the
two campuses — even though he would like to see

more. He was instrumental in founding the Lampost
at W&L, and in sponsoring a joint Easter service
which was held in Lee Chapel last spring.

After spending most of Saturday telephoning
parents to inform them of the deaths, he still
mustered enough strength to speak at W&L’s Inter-
Varsity meeting that night.

“One reason I was able to speak that Saturday
night despite my own pain and mourning, is that I
knew I could find someone that cared, and I did.
Afterwards, I was able to come back ... knowing
that whichever way we walked, someone would be
there caring. If we all had that feeling, that VMI’s
pain is W&L’s pain, and W&L’s pain is VMI’s pain.

*“‘Many of you guys were high school buddies and
neighbors. Let’s recognize it,”’ he said.

Steve Hupp, a second classman and a classmate
of the three victims, said that the concern expressed
by W&L has been an inspiration.

“‘Many guys here didn’t feel any W&L guys cared,
but I know some guys over there and it has amazed
me how they cared. I was sorry to see they weren’t
at the service, but I think it was more a feeling of
friction than not caring ... It’s great to walk into our
chapel on Sunday morning and see W&L guys. They
know they’re welcome and that school friction won’t
get in the way,’’ Steve said.

W&L Dean of Students Lewis John, said that
Washington & Lee ‘‘has been fortunate that it hasn’t
had more serious accidents.’’

There have been several accidents during Dean
John’s time here, but he indicated that several steps
have been taken to educate students about the
dangers of speeding and/or drunk driving. They in-
clude remarks he makes during freshmen orienta-
tion, a dorm counselor alcohol awareness program,
and the possible purchase in the near future of a
Breathalizer to help educate students about alcohol
intake levels.

Dean John also expressed the desire for W&L and
VMI to become closer, despite the nature of the stu-
dent life, which tends to prevent it.

Chaplain Caudill, reflecting back on the accident,
said that the corps of cadets and the families of the
victims were inspirations to him.

“One thing is vivid, and that is that (the three
cadets) were deeply loved by their families ... they
were diverse families, but similar in their love.

 

“T couldn’t be prouder than being the chaplain to -

this corps right now, the way they handled
themselves. There were Cadets who wanted to go to
the funerals, and we sent them to New York, New
Jersey, and Michigan, as well as the memorial ser-
vice at Randolph-Macon. I think we missed some-
thing by not having a service with Randolph-Macon,
VMI, and W&L.”’

Through it all, Chaplain Caudill has also remain-
ed strong, a hard task since he was friends with the
three cadets. He remembers them as freshmen
when they came to him with problems in the rat
line.

‘‘We impersonalize it fast, saying it can’t happen
to us. We knew they were human beings, but too fast
we put it behind us as if it didn’t happen. We avoid
pain at any cost, and end up blocking out the
reasons behind the tragedy,’’ he said.

W&L reacts to draft sign-up

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer

There was mixed student
reaction at Washington and Lee
University to the sentencing
Monday in San Diego, Calif., of
Benjamin H. Sasway to two-
and-one-half years in prison for
not registering with the Selec-
tive Service System. :

Sasway was released on
$10,000 bail pending appeal of
his case to the 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals. According to recent
news reports, Sasway’s legal
grounds for appeal include
arguments that the Selective
Service Act is unconstitutional,
that prosecutors illegally sin-
gled out him and other
outspoken resisters for prosecu-
tion, and that because he had no
criminal intent, his felony con-
viction is improper.

Enton Eller, a student at
Bridgewater College near Har-
risonburg, Va., has been given
until mid-Novemeber to regis-
ter or face a prison sentence.
Eller told the Associated Press
in August that to register under
threat ‘‘would make a farce out
of his efforts to obey the
authority of God,’ ‘‘a higher
judge,’’ whom he says led him
to resist registration.

Meanwhile there are more
than 10 other men who have
been indicted for allegedly
resisting the registration law
and government officials
estimate that about 500,000
Americans have failed to
register.

The maximum penalty is five
years in prison and a $10,000
fine for refusing to register.

An informal survey by the
Ring-tum Phi soliciting student
comments on this general trend
of events yielded a variety of
opinions.

“‘T registered more out of con-
venience than belief. Now I

have come to regret that, hav-
ing seen what happened to En-
ton Eller,” the News Director

For Friday, October Sth

for the college’s WLUR-FM,
Steve Warren, said.

“It is really a shame that we
can’t allow some portion of our
society to be active pacifists
and that everybody has to con-
form to some belief,’’ Warren
said.

“T really respect Eller, the
guy from Bridgewater,’’ Mike
Sokolowski said. ‘‘It is hollow to
be against the draft and Car-
ter’s whole gaffe, and then to go
register because you are afraid
of the repercussions.”’

‘*You have to be able to place
your ideals above those of the
state without questioning the
state’s authority, and I think
that can be done legitimately,”
Sokolowski said.

Top students in jail?

Keith Goretzka who is both an
ROTC scholarship student and
a senior religion major came
out clearly against the registra-
tion law.

“The law, in general, I have
negative feelings towards,”
Goretzka said. ‘‘What we are
doing as a nation is imprisoning
our moral leaders, and that is a
very serious problem.”’

“If it were not for the regis-
tration, these guys would be
tops in their communities, but
we are putting them in jail,”
Goretzka said.

‘‘What does that say about the
law?”’ he asked.

‘T could not stand behind the
law as it now is.”’ Goretzka said.

But while some students ex-
pressed opposition to the law_or
the idea of a draft, others had
favorable opinions.

“If there were not a tough law
like that, then people would
have ignored registration al-
together,” John Delehanty, a
senior economics major said.

“T think everybody should
register, there is no harm init,”’
Delehanty said. ‘‘It just makes
the government aware of who
they have available if they
decide they want to institute the
draft,”’ he said.

Registration doesn’t
equal draft
“Registration does not mean
that there is going to be a
draft,” said Morris Lewis, a
senior business administration
major who had been involved in

ROTC but dropped out because

he said he does not want to go
into the army.

“TY think that he (Sasway)
should have registered,’’ said
Robert Kurek, who is a
sophomore journalism major
and a ROTC scholarship stu-
dent. “If there were a draft, I
could see it, but there is no draft
and (registration) is the law.”

“I do sympathize with them,
but I do not condone their
means to an end,” Kurek said.
“There are other, more legal
ways to go about showing dis-
agreement,’ he said.

‘Registration does _ not
necessarily mean they are go-
ing to go to war, the govern-
ment only wants to know who is
around just in case,” said Lee
Hollis, a Sigma Alpha Epsilon
pledge.

“Tt is a law and they should
obey it,” he said.

“It seems like a stiff jail
sentence, but I think they de-
serve to pay for their national
insubordination,’’ said Phi
Delta Theta pledge Rob Mc-
Cullogh.

‘‘T think the jail sentence is
pretty fitting because I think it
will serve as an example to
others,’ said freshman Leslie
Hall.

“If it were me...”’

In expressing his opinion,
Senior Executive Committee
Representative John Viahoplus
acknowledged the difficult posi-
tion of both the government in
having to enforce registration
and the resister in having to
disobey the law.

“Eller is between a rock and
a hard place,’’ Viahoplus
said. “I would probably do the
same thing if I were in his posi-
tion.”’

Police chief investigated

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor
The Lexington City Council has named a former FBI agent to

conduct the investigation into the Office of the Chief of Police,

Mayor Charles Phillips announced in last week’s council meeting.

Kirby holds that post presently but has requested and received
administrative leave while the investigation is underway.

Several vague references at this summer’s police trials to Kirby
have raised questions about Kirby’s knowledge of the thefts. Kirby
has maintained that he had no knowledge of the theft ring’s opera-
tion during his six years as chief.

Statements of other officers made in the initial probe into the
theft ring suggest that Chief Kirby ran the department in a loosely
organized fashion and did not concern himself sufficiently with the
day to day activities of the patrolmen, some of whom were con-
victed for larcenies they committed while on duty.

The investigation will be concerned with the extent of Chief Kir-
by’s knowledge of these thefts and any evidence brought up in the
initial trials that might suggest Kirby’s involvement to any degree.

Leonard M. “Bucky’’ Walters, who worked for the FBI as a
special investigator from 1942-73 and later for the House of
Representatives also as an investigator, was the city’s choice to
perform the probe.

Walters has already conducted an investigation of this nature,
and was determined to be the most qualified of several men looked
at by the city, according to Mayor Phillips.

But the Shenandoah Intelligence Agency, a firm which conducts
similar investigations, claims Walters is not qualified for the posi-
tion. Although Walters has worked as a federal agent, the Shenan-
doah Intelligence Agency maintains he may not be familiar with
Virginia law and therefore is complaining on those grounds, the
Ring-tum Phi has learned.

Walters’ appointment is a result of a motion made by the city
council in September to investigate the office of Police Chief James
A. Kirby. This investigation follows a previous exposure of a police
theft ring that operated in Lexington throughout the 1970s. The pro-
be of that theft ring left many unanswered questions in relation to
Chief Kirby’s knowledge of the thefts.

“The Tin Drum” is one of a
number of recent German ar-
tistic efforts dealing with the
notorious traumas of the twen-
tieth centry. In this case, we
view the world through the eyes
of insane asylum inmate Oskar
Matzerath, born in Danzig in
1924 and so revolted — at the
age of three — by the world
around him that he decides to
stop growing. Thereafter,
Oskar becomes an observer of
life, battling its absurdities with

Bringing to the screen a pic-
turesque novel of metaphor and
allegory is no easy task and
Schlondorff’s film version of
“The Tin Drum’ has _ been
criticized by some for failing to
do justice to the book. It has
been noted that the novel as-
saults the intellect, while the
film attacks the senses. Schlon-
dorff fills the screen with star-
tling images, a number of which
may be overpowering for the
sensitive viewer. (Ironically,
this film is not for children of
any age. )

Pianist
tonight

A performance by Canadian
pianist Robert Silverman will
open the 1982-83 season of the
Washington and Lee University
Concert Guild on Thursday,
Oct. 7, at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Tickets for the concert will be
available at the door and are $4
for adults and $2 for non-Wash-
ington and Lee students.

Silverman’s concert will con-
sist of ‘‘Six Pieces, Op. 118” by
Brahms, ‘Sonata in C-sharp
minor, Op. 27 No. 2’’ by Beetho-
ven, and “Sonata No. 1 in D
minor, Op. 28” by Rachman-
inoff.

A native of Montreal, Silver-
man has been a soloist with
several important North
American orchestras and has
earned critical acclaim for his
performances.

pearance with the Milwaukee
Symphony, the Milwaukee
Sentinel called Silverman “a

Beard ‘‘was very nice’’ when
she went to talk with him on
Monday.

Roberson and Mrs. Keevan
grew up in the house, which she
said was built around 1792 and
has been in the family since the
1920’s. She said he used to have
an antique shop in town where
he repaired and decorated fur-
niture. It was closed after his
stroke, but he remained active
in his collecting.

Henry Simpson, owner of
Lexingington Antiques on
Washingington Street, called
the incident ‘‘shocking.” He
said he and Mr. Roberson were
“friends” and that he saw him
every day.

“Me’s had a routine since his
stroke,”’ ~Siuapson said, ‘‘He
needed exercising, soo’d am
by every day.”

‘Simpson said Roberson wai

“knowledgeable” and ‘knew
the finer points’ about anti-
ques. He said Roberson was “‘an
original character ... he had
strong beliefs and he’d say what
he thought.”

He said he was confident of
Mr. Roberson’s strength. “I
knew he’d be all right.”

Water polo ‘improving,
ups record to 10-4

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

It was another weekend of im-
provement for water polo,
Generals’ style. Despite a 2-2
record that put W&L at 10-4 for
the season and a third place
finish at the Slippery Rock State
Invitational, it was a relatively
pleased Coach Page Remillard
that returned to Lexington.

Taking top honors in Penn-
sylvania was host Slippery
Rock, followed by Bucknell,
with Ohio State, Indiana
University of Pennsylvania,
and Cleveland State rounding
out the bottom three slots.

W&L began the tournament
Friday evening with a 20-9
thumping of Cleveland State.
But later that night they fell to
the Bisons from Bucknell, 12-10,
although the scoring was even
in the second half.

Saturday the Generals met
nemesis Slippery Rock but fell
short of the mark again despite
outscoring Slippery Rock 11-8 in
the second half. W&L lost by
one goal, 19-18. They closed out
the invitational by taking out
their frustrations on Ohio State
with a 21-10 victory.

‘‘We played very well and we
are improving more than other
teams are,’’ commented Coach
Remillard. He was quite pleas-
ed with the offensive perfor-

mance as the Generals amass-
ed 69 goals in four contests.
‘“‘We’re pleased with our offen-
sive pressure and intensity,”
continued Remillard.

On the negative side,
however, the fourth-year men-
tor finds his squad vexed by its
own defense, specifically the
goaltending. As a matter of
fact, the Generals stopped only
a third of the attempted shots in
the deep end of the pool.

‘Something has to happen
there if we’re to beat these good
teams,’’ Remillard admitted.
The team will be working on
team defense this week, but one
can expect some one-on-one
meetings with Remillard and
his goalies.

This weekend W&L begins
conference play by hosting Zone
I play in the Southern League
Tournament, featuring teams
from Lynchburg, James Madi-
son, VMI, and George Washing-
ton. Remillard feels with
deserved confidence that the
Generals should be the favored
team both for the conference
and state titles and sees the up-
coming competition as a
“weekend of execution.’’ Play
begins Friday afternoon and
will continue at Cy Twombly
Pool through Saturday after-
noon.

 

  
   
   
   
  
   
 
    
   
  
   
 
   
    
 
  
   
  
  
   
  
   
   
   
  
   
   
  
  
 
  
   
  
    
  
   
   
  
 

Prayers
unanswered

Even prayer couldn’t help
this Maryville goalie last Satur-
day on Wilson Field as Wash-
ington and Lee demolished the
Scots by a 7-1 count for their
third consecutive victory.

However, the Generals drop-
ped their first game of the
season to Roanoke College on
Tuesday by a 3-2 count. Their
record is now 3-1-1.

Senior Brad Poorman scored
two of his three goals in the first
half as Washington and Lee rac-
ed toa 4-0 lead at halftime.

Tom Elder, Bill Holmes, Bob
Coleman and Eric Obeck each
tallied one goal for W&L. Senior
co-captain Mark Carduner
passed out two assists.

In the loss to Roanoke, the
Generals never led, despite
managing to tie the Maroons at
1-1 and 2-2 on goals by Poor-
man. The winner for Roanoke
came with just nine minutes to
go in the game.

Last Wednesday, Roland
Simon’s header with eleven
seconds on the clock gave the
Generals a 2-1 road victory over
Mary Washington.

Mary Washington had taken a
1-0 lead just five minutes into
the game, but Poorman tied the
score early in the second half
with a shot from the left wing.

W&L comes from behind for 20-19 win

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Sophomore Gene Girard’s
one-yard touchdown plunge and
a two-point conversion early in
the fourth quarter capped a
20-19 come-back victory for the
Washington & Lee Generals
over Randolph-Macon Satur-
day.
Randolph-Macon had the op-
portunity to blow the game open
in the second quarter, but tough
defense by W&L inside their
own twenty and a multitude of
Yellow Jacket miscues left the
Generals only six points down
at the half.

It was W&L which opened the
scoring, though, on a 25-yard
field goal by Bill Devine with 54
seconds left in the opening
quarter.

Randolph-Macon quickly re-

taliated. On the next play
fullback Alan Spinney romped
52 yards to the Generals’ 14-
yard line. One play later Gary
Richins scored from eight years
out. After a missed extra point
the Yellow Jackets led 6-3.

The next time RMC touched
the ball, they again demon-
strated their explosive offense
and their incompetent kicking
game. Gary Richins sprinted 55
yards for a touchdown and a
12-3 lead. It stayed that way
when the Yellow Jackets miss-
ed the extra point again.

On their next possession,
W&L utilized a pair of long runs
by Paradise to mount a threat.
When the drive stalled, Bill
Devine booted a 27-yard field
goal with 5:49 left in the half to
narrow the RMC lead to 12-6.

In the final five minutes the
Yellow Jackets wasted two ex-
cellent scoring opportunities.
After driving from their own 33-
yard line, an RMC receiver
dropped a sure touchdown pass
and kicker Cody Dearing miss-
ed a 27-yard field goal.

It looked like the Yellow
Jackets might still widen their
12-6 lead when Richins returned
a punt 60 yards to the W&L 22
with 26 seconds remaining.
W&L’s defense stiffened and
forced a field goal attempt,
which was blocked by sopho-
more Jim Lyall.

“Anytime you take away a
scoring threat it’s got to really
pick you up going into the locker
room,” noted W&L Coach Gary
Fallon.

W&L capitalized on an RMC
fumble to tie the game at 12-12
on Chris Cavalline’s one-yard
dive at 6:10 of the third quarter.

Less than six minutes later,
RMC went out in front 19-12 ona
2-yard touchdown run by Rich-
ins. Richins’ third touchdown of
the day was set up by a 76-yard
run by Alan Wright.

W&L bounced back quickly to
score the winning touchdown on

Girard’s run with 12:32 left in
the game. John Thompson hit
Cavalline with a pass for the
two-point conversion, which
gave the Generals their margin
of victory at 20-19.

“I was really pleased with
John’s performance. He had
some confidence coming in
there,’’ stated Coach Fallon.

The rest of the game belonged
to the Generals’ defense, as

they buried the Yellow Jackets
in their own territory.

“I knew this was a good team
we were going against. My kids
really rose to the occasion,”
said Fallon proudly.

The win boosted W&L to 2-0 in
the ODAC and 2-1 overall.

This Saturday the Generals
travel to Maryville College to
take on the Scots in an Old

Dominion Athletic Conference
game.

‘“‘Maryville is going to be a
physical game. If we’re not
careful, it could be another Cen-
tre,’’ warned Coach Fallon.

Quarterback Al Paradise’s
sprained ankle makes him a
questionable starter for the
game. Fallon thinks he pro-
bably will be able to play,
though.

McBryde leads harriers to 4-1 mark

Junior Angus McBryde
claimed the overall title Satur-
day as the Washington and Lee
cross-country team defeated
three other squads to up its
record to 4-1. The Generals
finished with 32 points to place
ahead of Roanoke (41), Norfolk
State University (86), and
Virginia State University (no
team score).

McBryde’s time of 27:57 was

The alumni scored two goals
late in the third period to break
an 8-8 tie and go on toa 14-11 vic-

The win gives the alumni a 5-3

lights fall lacrosse practice.
