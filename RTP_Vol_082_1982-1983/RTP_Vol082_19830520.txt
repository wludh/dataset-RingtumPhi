“J do solemnly swear that I
will faithfully discharge the
duties of the office to which I
have been appointed by the
Board of Trustees of Washing-
ton and Lee University to the
best of my skill and judgement
without fear or favor. So help
me God.”

The twenty seconds it took
John Delane Wilson to repeat
those words yesterday after-
noon marked an_ historical
event which was occurring for
the twenty-first time in over two
centuries-Washington and Lee
had a new president.

The eighth successor to
General Robert E. Lee, Wilson
was inaugurated at a ceremony
witnessed by 1200. Wilson, 51,
came to W&L from Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, where he.
served as provost.

He succeeds Robert E.R.
Huntley, who served as the
University. president beginning
in 1968. Huntley is now a
member of the W&L Law
School.

Wilson officially assumed his
duties on January 17, but was
not ceremonially installed until
yesterday. The inauguration
date was chosen to coincide
with the spring meeting of the
Board of Trustees.

In January, Wilson signed his
name to the oath in a journal
that dates back to 1897. It was
first signed by President
William Lynne Wilson. That
President Wilson’s inaugural
ceremony lasted three hours
and featured six speeches. The
ceremony yesterday was con-
siderably more brief — it in-
cluded two speeches and lasted,
as planned, for almost exactly
one hour.

The inauguration of President
Huntley fifteen years ago was
forced inside because of rain.
The same was destined to be the
case for his successor.

University Marshall C. West-
brook Barritt, who was in
charge of all the planning for
the event, had foreseen that
possibility. Two weeks ago, he
told a reporter:

“The weather is going to be

our final problem... If we have

City Council covers questionable

By WILLIAM ROBERTS
Editor-in Chief

Lexington’s Mayor and City
Council are refusing to allow
public scrutiny of a consultant’s
report which explores indica-
tions that former Police Chief
James A. Kirby condoned the
operation of a Lexington police
theft ring.

On April 20, a Freedom of In-
‘formation Act request by the
Ring-tum Phi was delivered to
City Manager John V. Doane.
The FOI letter requested one
copy of the report submitted to
Council on Dec. 8, 1982 by

special investigator L.M.
Walters.
Walters was hired by Council

in September to conduct an in-
vestigation into the office of the
Chief of Police after charges
surfaced last spring during the
Virginia State Police investiga-
tion of the local police theft
ring. Thirteen former and then
current police officers were in-
dicted in May 1982. Seven were
convicted of involvement in the
theft ring.

“As you may know the Va.
FOI Act provides that if por-
tions of a document are exempt
from release, the remainder
must be segregated and disclos-
ed,’’ the Phi’s FOI request said.
“There should be no excisions
of Mr. Walters’ statements of

fact relevant to the question of
whether Mr. Kirby should be re-
tained as a Lexington law en-
forcement officer.’’

Mayor Charles F. Phillips Jr.
responded to the Phi’s FOI re-
quest by letter dated April 22.

Phillips cited six exemptions of ©

the Act in declining the request.
“The Walters report deals
with the personnel of the Police
Department, including evalua-

tion of the office of the Chief of

‘Lots of times you could

spector. Phillips made a public
statement at the time, in which
he briefly characterized the
Walters report.

“Upon the conclusion of the
cases brought by the Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, City
Council felt an obligation to
Chief James A. Kirby and to the
citizens to undertake a com-
prehensive study of the Chief of
Police,” Phillips said.

‘‘Council wishes to emphasize

would say you didn’t

tell him.’

Police, and comments and re-
ports on interviews with private
citizens in personal matters not
related to public business. It is
the opinion of the Mayor and Ci-
ty Council that the report is not
subject to public disclosure,”
Phillips said in the reply letter.
On Jan. 6, Council accepted
Kirby’s resignation as Chief of
Police and named him to his
current position of special in-

that it has never questioned
James A. Kirby’s loyalty to the
Department and the City, or his
personal honesty and integrity.
Our consultant’s’ report sup-
ported our position when it was
concluded: “In the course of in-
quiries conducted, no one has
suggested that Chief Kirby was
other than personally honest,”’
Phillips said.

“However, the consultant’s

Report did contirm our concern
about the lack of vigorous ad-
ministration of the Police
Department.”’

Council immediately began
proceedings to hire a new police
chief. The department was lead
by Sgt. Bruce M. Beard as act-
ing chief and Kirby remained
on administrative leave with
pay until the new Police Chief,
Lawrence O. Sutton, took office
on May 9. Kirby now works full
time as the department’s
special inspector, second in
authority only to Chief Sutton.

Chief Sutton told the Phi last
week that he has not read the
Walters report but that he plan-
ned to read it soon. This week,
Sutton told the Phi that he has
not yet read the Walters report.

“The powers that be were
satisfied with the Walters
report and as far as I’m con-
cerned it is a dead issue...the
past is the past. I can only deal
with the here and now. I have no
responsibility for the past and I
don’t believe in witch hunts,”
Sutton said.

Walters’ investigation of Kir-
by resulted from public allega-
tions made during the summer
trials of indicted police officers
and from testimony given to
State Police investigators in
March and April 1982. State
Police Special Agents Tex
Chapman and Louis Layne rais-
ed questions of whether Kirby

into Warner Center, and that’ll
be difficult, but that’s what
we’ll have to do for the whole
works....

“T hate to think of it, so I’m
sort of putting it out of my mind
psychologically.’’ All of the in-
augural proceedings were sche-
duled to take place in front of
Lee Chapel, a National Historic
Landmark constructed under
President Lee’s supervision.

In spite of recent favorable
weather, Thursday promised to
be wet in Lexington. The glitzy
weather maps on the network
news shows ordained thunder-
storms for the region, and the
morning paper, as if to curse
the festivities, had jeered,
‘‘thundershowers likely today.”’
For once, the weather wizards
were right.

It began to rain at about ten
o’clock, but with the inaugura-
tion five hours away, the plan-
ners did not give up easily.
Sheltering himself under an
umbrella, a university official
said, ““We’re going to have it

department.

Former State Trooper and
convicted conspirator Marvin
Hamilton served on the Lex-
ington police force from 1977 to
1981. During interrogation by
State Police on March 19, 1982,
Hamilton was asked, “Did you,
yourself ever bring anything to
the Chief’s attention?”’

“I remember bringing a lot, a
lot of stuff to his attention, but
specifics I don’t remember.
Every time you’d get the same
answer, You gotta have proof,
or something to that effect,”
Hamilton said.

Later in the questioning,
Hamilton was asked if ‘the
Chief was told by Colbert and
Coleman about the activities of
Purvis and Flint?”’

“Yes sir,’’ Hamilton said.

‘‘Now Marvin, you state that
you were going to work one eve-
ning on the four o’clock shift
and as you went in Colbert and
Coleman were coming out of the
Chief’s office,’ Layne said.

“They were either coming out
or were sitting in there, he had,
had a glass door and you could
see who was in there more or
less,’ Hamilton said.

“Do you know what their pur-
pose was for being in the Chief’s
office?’’ Layne asked.

To the Editor,
{ I would like to respond to your
article on black student life at

house, ball and campus
speakers. I am not aware of it
having any white members.

 

by NORMAN BALL
Special to the Phi

The nuclear freeze movement
in Amercia has been receiving
support from many, up until
now, divergent corners of socie-
ty, among them, scientists,
musicians, and, most recently,
the American Catholic Church.
One common tact of all these
organizations has been to ad-
dress the government on behalf
of the people. In light of this
common approach, it might be
advantageous to examine some
assumptions implicit in this ‘‘in-
formal referendum” strategy.

First of all, it may be asking
too much of our govern nent to
police itself in nuclear weapon
matters because governmental
responsibility cannot be ex-
pected to extend beyond the
bounds of its recognized
sovereignty. All governments
represent a_ strictly non-
universal constituency. Be-
tween governments, there con-
tinues to exist a ‘state of
nature’ (with perhaps the
nominal exceptions of the World
Court, United Nations etc...)
Thus, in asking our government
to practice restraint in its deal-
ings with other governments,
we, in effect, ignore the nature
of the beast, whose predilection
it is to protect itself with
whatever resources — nuclear
or otherwise — it can assemble.
We have entrusted an unstable
social structure — government
— with the capability to
eradicate humanity.

Moreover, it has never been
clear just how nuclear weapons
were ever intended for the pro-
tection of the “people.” A
nuclear stockpile seems to in-
sure only the perpetuation of a
regime, where each competing
regime holds the other’s
citizenry hostage. This argu-
ment is premised on the idea
that while a people can con-
ceivably exist without a regime,
no regime can survive without a
people. Thus, though our

Nuclear freeze examined |

e
governments would have us
believe otherwise, the real
enemy is neither Russia nor
America; these are only
convenient foci for our collec-
tive attentions. Rather, the real
conflict is a more fundamental
—and ancient — one, between
the governed and the gover-
nors. The Russian people mean
me no harm; it is the Soviet
regime that I must fear. On the
other hand, I mean no harm to
the Russian people, though I
hesitate in making the same
assurances on behalf of my
government.

In the wake of an impressive
grass-roots campaign perhaps
spurred by this realization, Con-
gress has moved recently to im-
pose a nuclear freeze on the
government. Advocates for a
strong executive have derided
the bill on constitutional
grounds, citing it as an infringe-

Armed Forces. They argue that
the President’s efforts as a
negotiator would be seriously
hampered if he was prevented
from posing nuclear retaliation
as a viable, if unspoken, alter-
native in his dealings with un-
cooperative nations. In short,
the President would lose a
powerful bargaining chip if he
was denied a nuclear capabili-
ty.

What these critics fail to
realize, however, is that the
very presence of a nuclear

' alternative serves to minimize

the gravity of its anticipated ef-
fect. Sustained dialogue has a
way of purging a subject of its
mystique, and it is perhaps the
‘‘mystique” of utter annihila-
tion that has spurned govern-
ments from adopting a nuclear
solution up until now.
Furthermore, there is the
danger that people will become
too comfortable (or, better, less
uncomfortable) with the con-
cept of nuclear weaponry. As
the images conjured by

 

Nagasaki and Hiroshima fade
with the passing of a genera-
tion \uclear exchange will once

again become a dangerous
abstraction. Already, there is
talk of “limited nuclear ex-
changes” in surprisingly high
places of government. Granted,
these scenarios are always
couched in a _ barrage of
rhetorical qualifications
(‘under extenuating  cir-
cumstances,”’ ‘‘in dire national
emergencies,’’ etc...). But
again, that they are even
discussed indicates that a
nuclear response exists within
the realm of possible policy
decisions.

Furthermore, the very notion
of a “limited nuclear ex-
change’”’ is, in itself, a ques-
tionable occurrence. Without
even considering the very
human factors of revenge and
willful retaliation, there re-
mains serious question as to
whether a nuclear exchange
can ever properly be called
“‘limited.’’ The damage to the

environment alone might be so

extensive as to render the perif-
pheral effects “‘limitless.”’

The implications of the
nuclear debate, then, are such
that we might have to reach
beyond our government to find
a suitable solution. Because of
the ultimate nature of nuclear
weapons, a more direct popular
mechanism must be employed
to reduce our reliance upon
government. Government,
after all, is a means towards
enriching people’s lives. But in
releasing nuclear weapons into
the hands of government, we ef-
fectively provide the ‘‘means’’
with the capability to destroy its
ends. — us.

Ideally, no
bodyshould be permitted such
an inordinate amount of power
in determing the existence (or
nonexistence) of posterity. But
with nuclear weapons an in-
escapable reality, we all have a
responsibility to address this
issue directly.

 

; W&L. I am fully aware of the

fact that this is not the ideal
university for minority life.
However, I believe that your ar-
ticle reflected a number of
misconceptions and that lack of
communication which has led to
the current problem.

First of all, in my two years
here, I have never heard of the
so called ‘“Dixie’’ parties that
include simulated lynchings,
nor has anyone that I have ask-
ed. While there can be no de-
nials that there are bigots in our
student body, the disgusting
outbursts of a few students can-
not condemn all W&L students
asracists.

Black students are separated
from the W&L social life, but I
believe that this is partly their
own choice. I have never under-
stood why we need a Student
Association for Black Unity,
which is exclusionary by its
very nature. This group re-
ceives a large amoung of stu-
dent funds, and it has its own

In my opinion, those black
students who are involved at
W&L are primarily on sports
teams, where they get to know
other students. Being in the
same academic classes is not
enough. If black students want
to know white students, they
must be involved in more than
one aspect of student life.

The Ring-tum Phi has done
all W&L students a service by
informing the community of the
problems of black students.
Most students, myself included,
probably had no idea of the
scope of the problem. Black

- students must realize that they

have the same oportunities to
get involved in campus-wide
organizations and activities.
The only way that black stu-
dents can become fully ac-
climated to W&L is if they know
the people who they go to school
with.

Sincerely,
Marc F. Monyek ’85

Coed -- Freedoms

To the Editor,

Your May 13th contention
that the introduction of women
into the Washington and Lee en-
vironment would bring about a
restrictive parietal system
seems to me to be fallacious.
You stated that part of Wash-
ington and Lee’s institutional
philosophy was to provide ‘‘a
climate of learning that
stresses the importance of the
individual and his personal
honor and integrity.’’ You fur-
ther stated that ‘‘our freedoms
are testimony to the existence
of such a climate.’ I ask
—Won’t women be allowed the
freedom of this climate?
Women have individual rights
also. Within the framework of
those rights is their personal
choice to see men whenever and
wherever they please. Further-
more, we do not have a parietal
system for female law stu-

dents; why should we have one
for undergraduates?
Washington and Lee’s respon-
sibility to women students will
be one of security. A beefed-up
security force and electronic
equipment such as a rape but-
tons will be adequate protection
for Washington and Lee fe-
males. Just because the sur-
rounding women’s. colleges
have parietal systems does not
mean W&L will adopt such a
policy. Coed schools such as
Davidson and Amherst do not
have parietal systems. I think
W&L has much more in com-
mon with these coed schools
than with the nearby women’s
colleges. If W&L goes coed, I
think it will be taking a step for-
ward. Hopefully for every step
forward we take we will not
take two steps backward.
Respectfully
Gordon Witherspoon ’83

Rats eating lunch. They are allowed to look only at their plates, must lift their food only

*

at right angles, and are required to thoroughly chew and swallow each bite before cutting

The life of a VMI rat is *

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Staff Writer

(Editor’s Note: This story first ap-
peared in the Richmond News
Leader.)

About 400 Virginia Military
Institute cadets were cele-
brating. They were muddy and
exhausted, but still hugging
each other and hollering class

yells.
The reason?
They had just been

transformed, from a “‘mass’’ of
Rats to a class of fourth-class
cadets. No longer were they
subjected to the trials and
tribulations of the VMI ratline.
The rats had “‘broken out” and
the class of ’86 had been born.

The rat line, an approximate-
ly seven-month period filled
with rigorous mental and
physical trials, had ended.
Each first-year VMI cadet must
have survived the ratline before
the rank of fourth classman is
bestowed upon him.

In the words of one cadet, the
ratline is ‘‘pure hell.”

As tradition has it, the cadets
escape the treacherous grasps
of the ratline in a rite known as
Breakout. It is a Wednesday
ritual that proceeds Resurrec-
tion, a week of extremely tough
mental and physical adversity.

According to third classman
and cadre corporal Kar] Marks,

Oy Og ae Os oes ee TO OS A OOS

Breakout is a week of physical
training and duress, including
reat parties and rifle runs,

s many as several a day.”’

Of course, this could prove to
be a False Resurrection, a
deception that often breaks the
spirit of the cadets. But, if it is
indeed the real thing, the rats
know that Breakout is but a few
days away.

‘‘(Breakout) brought feelings
of anxiety, we didn’t know what
to expect,’’ said Charles Simp-
son, a first year cadet from
Blackstone. “After you get
through it, though, it’s a good
feeling.”

“The theory behind breakout
is that the rats have to get past
the third class and the second
class to be recognized as fourth
classmen,”’ explained Marks.

On that day, the rats advance
in waves against their up-
perclass adversaries. They
scale a muddy hill hosed down
by firetrucks and manned by se-
cond classmen trying to stop
them. After a low crawl through
mud, they then fight their way
past the third classmen in a pit
filled with sundry rubbish and
debris.

The rats, though, were not the
only ones relieved by the ar-
rival of Breakout. So was Brent
Dunahoe. A first classman from
Tyler, Texas, he is president of

the Rat Disciplinary Committee

(RDC), the body that enforces
rat restrictions and the rat line.

“It felt good for me, too,” he
said with a laugh. ‘‘It was pret-
ty moving as well.

“‘We had everybody assembl-
ed in the old courtyard. I saw
the first class president and my
regimental commander up
there. That was a pretty special
moment for me. I had a pretty
good head rush.”’

The moment was special for
the rats for a different reason,
though. They had survived the
phenomenon known as the VMI
ratline.

“The purpose of the ratline;’’
said Dunahoe, ‘‘is to take all
these 400 individuals, get them
looking alike, get them in an en-
vironment that’s tough, stress-
filled, and try to mold them as
one, get them to act in unity.

“‘You don’t want to take away
their individuality, per se, but
you want them to depend on
each other, and to act and con-
form to the system so that they
need each other to overcome
what we’re throwing out at

them.”’
The ratline has often been

described as a tougher counter-
part to the plebe systems found
at the military academies.

Hell”

are but part of the physical tests
to which the rats are subject.

The rats also have to over-
come mental and emotional
duress. They are constantly
degraded by the upper-
classmen. They memorize the
“Rat Bible,” a book which lists,
among other things, honor
council and class officer names,
traditional fight songs, and
founding dates of VMI build-
ings. They must know menus
three meals in advance. They
are also inundated with a flood
of rat rules and restrictions.
And sometime in between, they
must study.

“There is a degree of in-
terference to study time,” said
Dunahoe, “But that makes you
have to budget your time. You
have other things to do, you
can’t be wasting it, you can’t
just be sleeping, or doodadding
here or there, watching TV.

“You have to know exactly
what you’re doing at all times.
People say this is bad, but it
helps you. It helps you develop
that self-discipline you need
later on to survive, whether you
are going into the military or
civilian life.

“Besides, what is their life?
(The Ratline) is the whole
thing.

“As far as negative things
about the rat system,” he con-
tinued, ‘‘some of the things we

of

 

  

do may be pretty trivial, like
working a guy out for not know-
ing a certain piece of informa-
tion, but again this is part of
paying attention to detail, pay-
ing attention to the little things.
If you don’t know the little
things, how are you going to
know the big things?”’ he asked
rhetorically.

Most of the rats can take the
pressure; a lot cannot. Assis-
tant Director of Admissions
Mark Sandy noted that VMI’s
attrition rate is 15-18 percent.
He attributes only a part of this
to the ratline, though. Some
leave for academic reasons,
and some just decide that VMI
is ‘‘not for them,” he explained.

But there are those who leave
because they are not capable of
handling it. Often they depart
confused or in anguish. Yet they
leave without the condolences
of their classmates.

“If you can’t hack it, you can
just quit. I have no sympathy
for them at ali,”’ said Dunahoe,
with a stoic glare. ‘‘If they can’t
handle what we’re giving out,
they have no business being
here.

“If they are going to call
home to their parents every
time they get yelled at, I’ll wave
to them. I’ll help them pack.
They can leave.

“We don’t treat anybody dif-

Commentary

 

Fed has proper role in contraceptives

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Liberal-run-amok

In his letter to the editor (‘‘In
favor of the ‘squeal rule’ ”’ May
13), Mr. Hayden wonders ‘‘why
the government is in the con-
traceptive business.’’ One
might as well wonder why the
government is in the welfare
business. The two are closely
linked, indeed the distribution
of contraceptives could be
regarded as_ preventative
welfare.

Mr. Hayden takes exception
the government’s distribution
of contraceptives for both
economic and humanistic
reasons, and I disagree with his
reasoning on both.

Mr. Hayden decries the use of
the taxpayer’s money to pay for
contraceptives for teenagers,
yet he fails to see that the tax-
payers will come out financially
ahead by sponsoring the distri-
bution of contraceptives and
sex education. It is far less ex-
pensive to supply a young cou-
ple with contraceptives and
counseling than to pay for an
abortion or — even worse — to
support a child whose parents

are unable to.

Mr. Hayden also alleges the
government, by distributin or
financing the distribution of
contraceptives, is ‘‘promoting”’
sexual activity among our
youth. Mr. Hayden must be liv-
ing in a vacuum if he does not
realize that sexual activity
among our youth needs no pro-
motion. Furthermore, the quiet
distribution of contraceptives
“‘promotes”’ sexual activity far
less than Hollywood or televi-
sion, both potent forces in form-
ing the attitudes teens hold.

Mr. Hayden’s most serious
error is when he says the people
receiving contraceptives from
the government are ‘not
mature enough to handle the re-
sponsibility (of their sexual ac-
tivity).” By seeking contracep-
tives, the youths are struggling
to accept the responsibility for
what they are doing. The people
who. are not accepting their
responsibility are the ones who
are not seeking help at the
clinics.

Mr. Hayden says the govern-
ment is undermining the ‘‘back-
bone of American society — the
family,’’ however he fails to see

this is erroneous on two points:
First, the average youth’s
parents are not trained profes-
sionals who know about con-
traceptives and sexuality, so
they are not properly qualified
to act as such; Second, and
more importantly, if a teenager
felt secure talking about such
matters with his parents, and
his parents were able to help,
there would not be any need to
seek out federally-funded
counseling or contraceptives.
Unfortunately, the average 16-
year-old is not going to want to
admit to his parents that he is
sexually active, so the clinics
are acting as unbiased and un-
punishing stablizing forces
helping confused teens deal
with very complicated and emo-
tional (not to mention private
and embarrassing) issues.

Rather than undermining the
position of the parents, the
clinics are acting where the
parents have already failed. It
is quite possible more strife
would be caused within families
if parents knew about their
children’s activities than if it
occurred behind their backs,
which is a sad fact.

Being male, Mr. Hayden is
able to take a very flippant at-
titude towards pregnancy and
its consequences because he
does not have to worry about it,
yet every woman who is sexual-
ly active must. If a teenage girl
becomes pregnant she will be
marred for life.

If a young girl who is preg-
nant decides to have an abor-
tion, she will be forced to deal
with the moral aspects of that
decision, and the thought of
having lost her child, a part of
her. If she should give birth and
try to raise the child herself, her
education and social life may be
ruined, and she may never re-
cover her lost education or
youth. If she enlists the aid of
her family this will place an in-
credible burden on this fragile
structure. Or, if a girl gives her
child up for adoption (and very
few do), she will once again
have to deal with the torment of
a lost child, the social
stigmatization and interrupted
education, in addition to the
medical risks encountered by a
young woman giving birth.

All of this torment could, and
should, be prevented. It is up to

the couple to accept this respon-
sibility, but our society should
give them all the support possi-
ble.

Regarding the “Baby Doe
Rule,”’ Mr. Hayden stresses the
term “natural course,’’ failing
to see that the intervention
covered by this rule is hardly
the natural course of life.
Feeding through i.v. tubes is far
from natural or normal. Mr.
Hayden defends the newly-born
infant’s right to ‘“‘normal, pro-
per and natural care,”’ but does
this include radical reconstruc-
tive surgery for a severely mal-
formed children with little hope
of survival? If a child’s body is
unable to support its own life,
the care that sustains life is
hardly “normal.” ‘Normal’
care for a new-born infant
should include diaper chang-
ings, bathing and feeding; NOT
dialysis machines, respirators,
i.v. tubes and electronic equip-
ment. True, this care should be
given toa child that will recover
and later develop normally, but
should it be given to a being that
will never mature emotionally
or physically?

New chief talks about students and the ABC law

By WIN SISSON
Phi Staff Writer

A law change effective in July
of this year could have a major
impact on the nature of the rela-
tionship Lexington’s new Chief
of Police Lawrence 0. Sutton
will form with the students of
Washington and Lee. Because
of recent legislation it will be il-
legal for any person under the
age of 19 to drink alcoholic
beverages in the state of
Virginia. What this means is,
during Rush next year approx-
imately 80 percent of the
freshmen will not be of legal
drinking age. According to next
year’s SAB Treasurer John
Haywood, all Rush dates will be
dry.

Sitting with his back.straight,
elbows resting securely on his
new desk, and hands clasped
firmly together the Chief ex-
pressed his view on the new law
in simple black and white
terms: “It will be up to the
students in positions of respon-
sibility to prevent problems

from arising ... I believe it is the
constitutional right of any per-
son to do as he pleases as long
as he does not infringe upon the
rights of others, however for
every act there is a conse-
quence, for every cause an ef-
fect.’’ He noted that he did not
want to take any ‘‘drastic
measures,’’ but was quick to
add “‘there will be control.”
Chief Sutton’s, 31 years of
police work have involved him
in many things including
special work in_ narcotics,
homocide, and .intra-
departmental security. His past
record does nothing to disprove
his self-description as ‘‘a
curious and tough discipli-
narian.” As he settled into his
office he expressed his desire to
talk with students of the univer-
sity in order to build effective
lines of communication bet-
ween the department and W&L.
Sutton vowed to be available at
all times in hopes of for-
mulating a policy based on
mutual cooperation with the
college students of Lexington.

Former Police Chief James
A. Kirby will aid Sutton in his
transition from Virginia Beach
to Lexington. Kirby is acting in
the newly created capacity of
police inspector. A sheet hand-
ed out during the January 11
Council meeting tentatively
described Kirby’s new job in
this fashion: ‘‘The inspector
performs difficult protective
work in the police department
involving an element of per-
sonal danger. (He) personally
participates in more complex
police problems; does related
work as required.”’

Chief Sutton was more spe-
cific in describing the duties
Kirby will perform. They in-
clude: reporting shitt sche-
dules, scheduling in service
training, recruiting and train-
ing new officers, keeping inven-
tory of department supplies and
following the dictates of the
police chief.

Kirby resigned his post as
chief in mid-January, following
a report submitted to City Coun-
cil in December by L.M. Wal-

ters, an independent in-
vestigator hired by Council to
study the office of chief of
police. At the time of Kirby’s
resignation, Mayor Phillips em-
phasized that the Council had
never questioned Kirby’s ‘‘per-
sonal honesty or integrity,” and
City Manager John Doane
stated that the position of in-
spector had been under con-
sideration for four or five years.
The police inspector receives a
salary of $20,000 while the
salary of chief of police ranges
from $19,250 to $24,578 reported
Doane. Kirby, who turns 53 this
month, will be eligible for
retirement when he is 55. At the
time of Kirby’s resignation
Doane declined to make the
Walters report public explain-
ing that since the report con-
tained a study of the office of
chief of police, personnel issues
were inseparable from a study
of the office itself.

Stating that he still Had not
read the Walters report, Chief
Sutton explained: ‘The powers
that be were satisfied with the

am concerned it is a dead issue
... the past is the past, I can only
deal with the here and now ... I
have no responsibility for the
past and I don’t believe in witch
hunts.”

With an obvious desire to
start afresh Sutton concluded:
“I want to have a dedicated,
cooperative proficient, profes-
sional department which the
community can take pride in.”

The same body of profes-
sionals which presents ‘‘the
Oscars’ each year — the
Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences — has award-
ed Washington and Lee Univer-
sity junior Richard Rosser the
1983 Student Achievement
Award for his animated film,
‘“‘No One For Chess.”’

Rosser’s “‘clay-motion”’ of a
surreal chess game was deem-
ed the most artistically and
technically creative animation
ina field of entries that included
submissions from students at
the nation’s prominent film
schools. For excellence in
animation, one of four award
categories, Rosser will enjoy
round-trip airfare to Los
Angeles, where he will be
awarded a trophy and a $1,000 |
grant. The June 5 ceremony at
the Academy’s Goldwyn Thea-
tre in Beverly Hills will cap off
four days of contact with
motion-picture innovators and
personalities. Rosser’s work
will be included in the compila-
tion of winning films, which
tours American’s colleges, art
centers, and museums.

Rosser received a telegram
the night of April 17, and was
“bouncing off the walls’ as
soon as he saw the Beverly Hills
return address. “I’m still like,
trying to take it all in,”’ he said
in an interview with the Phi
Wednesday. ‘‘It’s unreal. It also
shows the nation’s film industry
that we have a diverse school.”
Addressing accusations of a
sterile environment at W&L,
Rosser said,’’There is some
creativity going around. You
just have to search it out. You
have to be active.”

The producer of ‘‘No One For
Chess’’ found his own creative
impulse in a Journalism film
seminar last spring. His award-
winning film was first submit-

ted as a term project for Pro-
fessor John K. Jennings. Rosser
said he was “intrigued” by
animation and chose the clay
medium because he feels he is
‘not very artistic.’”’ Rosser
decided on a chess motif to
“animate an amazing thing that
can’t move in real life.” Using a
game table from the student
coop, he blacked out the borders
to isolate a central chess board.
The craftsman then spent three
days molding the clay
chessmen.

“I have no concept of
strategic chess,’ Rosser con-
fessed, ‘‘so I had two friends
play a long-winded game while
I recorded their moves.” This
phase of the project posed the
greatest obstacle to Rosser,
because one of the players
repeatedly worked toward a

Film Society to screen

Herzog’s “Stroszek”’

The Washington and Lee Film
Society’s final presentation of
the 1982-83 season will be the
1977 German film ‘‘Stroszek,”’
directed by Wener Herzog. The
film, which is in German with
English sub-titles, will be shown
at 8 p.m. in classroom A of
Lewis Hall in the W&L Law
School. There is no charge for
admission and the public is in-
vited.

Director Herzog has been one
of the leading figures of the New
German Cinema. Among his
best-known works are ‘‘Aguirre
— The Wrath of God,”
‘‘Nosferatu,’’ “‘Heart of Glass,”’
‘*Kasper Houser,’’

‘“‘Woyckeck,”’
roldo.”’
‘Stroszek’’ is a bittersweet
“ballad” of three misfits — a
simple-minded jail-bird, a pro-
stitute, and a dotty old man
—who make a pilgrimage from
Berlin to the promised land of
northern Wisconsin, where they
find that the American Dream
is available on the installment
plan. Their efforts to cope with
the illusions and realities of
modern society are both
humorous and poignant.

quick checkmate. ‘‘He kept win-
ning,’’ Rosser lamented, ‘‘and I
needed a long sequence. I had to
keep reminding them to make
as many captures as possible.”

Rosser used the game’s se-
quence as the basis for his film.
Ensconced in a cubicle on the
fourth floor of Reid Hall, the
producer spent more than 20
hours filming the 3-minute
animation.

To produce the illusion of the
chessmen’s independent mo-
tion, Rosser would sculpt or
shift a piece and then expose

two or three frames of 16 mm

film. Through this meticulous
progression, the pieces seem to
move fluidly. This is the effect
alluded in the title, ‘‘No One For
Chess.” The chess figurines
themselves wage the battle,

rea awe Ze wwe www AWA WWW Ow LL

  
 

   

which is punctuated by bizarre
and often humorous metamor-
phoses.

At one point, a _ bishop
becomes a rocket and fires
diagonally across the board,
toppling several pieces before
capturing an enemy rook. Later
a tree sprouts up in an unoc-

cupied square, transforms to —

the shape of a centipede and
then scurries around the board.
The insect finally becomes a
shepherd’s hook which pulls a
meek pawn off the board. When
another pawn is knocked out by
one of his counterparts, a
ponderous monk wanders onto
the board to bear away the dead
knave.

Many of the captures take
strange turns — a bishop’s head

becomes a decapitating scythe;
a triumphant knight rears its
head and neighs a silent, vic-
tory whinny. Many of these
were spontaneous innovations,
designed to draw the viewer’s
attention away from the techni-
cal progress of the chess con-
test. By placing two or three
figures in motion simultaneous-
ly, Rosser created a film which
still holds surprises after
several screenings. ‘‘I got into it
and got on a roll,’’ Rosser said.
“It was so much fun, I worked
four to six hours at a time.”

Most of the production time
was devoted to reshaping the
clay figures. Rosser said the
filming flowed so smoothly that
he only had to edit two sections
— once where he had left a
sculpting knife in the field of
view, and once to splice the
credits to the front of the
filmstrip.

 

Ascene from the film.

Rosser, a Business Ad-
ministration major from
Oklahoma City, said that
“Since the recognition of my
film by the Academy, I have
become more interested in film
and video as media of expres-
sion. With the $1,000 grant, I
hope to continue experimenting
with these media, especially
with video.’’ Rosser said video,
which is now being creatively
linked to computers, is at the
cutting edge of film innovation.
“You are limited only by your
imagination.”

minute. We’re setting up in both
places. As of now, it’s still out-
side.”’

With only a few hours remain-
ing before the ceremony, Presi-
dent Wilson told a visitor to his
office, ‘‘It’d be so much better
to be out and have Lee Chapel in
the foreground and the Colon-
nade in the background.

“T told them, ‘We’ll do it with
umbrellas if we have to. Let’s
hold off until the last feasible
moment.’”’ The buildings and
grounds crews continued to
ready both locations.

A local merchant summed up
the dilemna when she told a stu-
dent, ‘‘The aesthetics are for
Lee Chapel, but common sense
says Warner Center.”’

The latter prevailed. Two
hours before the 3:00 ceremony
the inaugural committee an-
nounced that the event would be
held in the Warner Center gym-
nasium. The weather situation

 

was on everyone's mind, and
President Wilson mentioned it
at the beginning of his ‘‘Re-
sponse”’ after taking the oath of
office:

“T mustn’t begin this glorious
day for me and for my family
with an apology,’’ he said. “I
won’t do that, I’ll do it in fact
with a note of gratitude to
trustee Jack Warner, who pro-
vided the shelter that we now
seek from the elements.

“I ask you to imagine behind
me the marvelous face and
form of Lee Chapel, and I, in
turn, will look out and suppose
that we’re looking out from the
stage upon the Colonnade that

so graces this marvelous
place.”’
In fact, behind President

Wilson’s head was an enormous
bronze plaque designating ‘‘The
A.E. Mathis Wrestling Room.”

son’s first disappointing ex-
perience with inclement

weather. In an interview a few
hours before the ceremony, he
described a high school football
game that ‘‘was very important
at the time that I vividly
remember losing.”’

The winning touchdown came
off a 50-yard pass for which
Wilson, as safety, was responsi-
ble. “We shouldn’t have been
able to play, and he shouldn’t
have been able to throw the ball

and they shouldn’t have been -

able to catch it, but they did.”
Preceeding the oath of office,

the ‘“‘Convocation Address”’ was

given by Dr. Thomas A. Bart-

lett, chancellor of the Univer- —

sity of Alabama system. Wilson
said he met Bartlett when he
was president of Wells College,
a school for women in Aurora,
New York, and Bartlett was
president of Colgate University,
which at that time was an all-
male institution. ‘“‘We had a
W&L-Hollins type of relation-
ship,” Wilson said.

The two men had crossed
paths earlier in their careers
without knowing it — Bartlett
was leaving Oxford University
the same summer Wilson was
arriving.

Wilson said in the interview
that Bartlett ‘is a wonderful
man. I’ve always admired Tom.
He’s full of energy—bright as he
can be. We’ve been friends for
14 or 15 years.”

Bartlett returned the com-
pliments in his speech. He call-
ed Wilson ‘‘one of the most ad-
mired and respected people in
American higher education,”’
and told the audience, ‘Your
University has chosen its new
president with great wisdom
and with great good fortune.”

He continued, ‘‘In John Wil-
son, you have selected for your
leader an ideal combination of
intelligence, refinement,
energy and experience. Seldom
have I been at an inauguration
where I felt so confident that the
elements for optimism were
present.”’

Bartlett admonished his
listeners: “‘You have the right
president; now you of W&L
must support him, nourish him,
and communicate with him.”’

In his address, ‘‘Change and
Tradition,” Bartlett discussed
three themes which ‘surround
higher education today. During
the Wilson era,” he said, “‘they
will provide much of the chal-
lenge for W&L and for all of
higher education.”

They were: “the crisis of
quality and purpose in primary
and secondary education, with
the strong reverberation that
comes into higher education’;
“the challenge of international
economic competitiveness fac-
ing our country’; and ‘the
threat of personal obselescence
in a time of rapid technological
change that faces all who
graduate.”

Wilson, wearing his black
academic robe with a royal blue
stole, spoke for twenty-five
minutes after taking the oath of

office. He promised his listen-
ers:

“T pledge to you all that I will
do everything in my power to
serve this university well and
faithfully and in the small ways
open to me will try, though I
know I can’t possibility do it,
but will try to repay you for
your confidence and your boun-
tiful kindnesses.”’

He praised the University on
a number of counts. Of its
heritage, he said, ‘‘We are here
to celebrate an institution ... not
the twenty-first president of the
institution, but the institution
itself — the sixth oldest in
America, graced by a remarka-
ble company of outstanding
leaders over time, quintessen-
tially, of course, General Lee
—the epitome of dignity and
courage and vision.”’

Wilson also admires the in-
stitution’s character. “It is a
place,”’ he said, ‘‘in which it is
still possible to talk of ideals
and of courtesy and of civility
and even to practice those
things.”’

He also spoke of one of W&L’s
most famous traditions. ‘‘The
Honor System here,’’ he told the
crowd, ‘‘is not an empty institu-
tion — it’s a lively and impor-
tant institution and students
carry the great burden of Disci-
plining each other to the stan-
dards and the conduct that we
expect of scholars § and

gentlemen.” .

The new president also is im-
pressed with the school’s
priorities. As an example, he
cited a comment James Ballen-
gee, the rector of the Board of
Trustees, had made to him at
the first board meeting. He
quoted Ballengee as - having
said:

‘Look, your main obligation
is to make as clear as possible
what it takes to maintain the
first-rate quality of this institu-
tion, and we, the trustees, will
see to the financial side, after
that, and make certain that you
will have the means to achieve
those ends. We look to you for
clear of expression of what is
required.”’

Wilson remarked, ‘‘I think
that is a most dramatic way of
saying that our priorities are in
order.”’

Other events during the in-
auguration included special
performances by the nine mem-
ber Brass Ensemble, directed
by Robert Stewart, and the 29-
member Glee Club, directed by
Gordon Spice.

The academic procession at
the program’s beginning includ-
ed the faculty, representatives
of about seventy other colleges
and universities, and 29 student
delegates. The academic robes,
observers @pted, bore the un-
mistakable dor of mothballs.

‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’
presented by theatre class

Although it is highly unlikely
that William Shakespeare had
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s ‘“lotal ‘Iineatre’ class in
mind when he penned “‘A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,’’ it is
nonetheless true that the bard’s
work suits the W&L class per-
fectly.

With a number of innovations
and plenty of surprises, the
W&L University Theatre pro-

duction of ‘“A Midsummer
Night’s Dream’’ will be
presented tonight, May 20

through May 25 in the
Troubadour Theatre on the cor-
ner of Main and Henry streets
in Lexington.

Curtain time for each perfor-
mance is 8 p.m. Tickets are $3.
Reservations are required and
can be made by calling the
theatre box office at 463-9111,
Ext. 371, or 463-9395 from 10:90
a.m, to4p.m.

The course known as ‘“‘Total
Theatre” at Washington and
Lee is offered during the univer-
sity’s six-week spring term and
is a study of the technical
aspects of directing and acting
problems involved in a specific
style of dramatic literature.
The course culminates in the
production of a play.

According to Albert C. Gor-
don, professor of fine arts at
W&L and director of ‘‘A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream,’’ the
Shakespeare play was selected
for the ‘“‘Total Theatre’ class
this spring because ‘‘it offers all
the challenges that we want the
students to experience in order
to get a truly “‘total’’ feel of the
production of a play. In addition
to providing a lot of parts, it
presents a variety of technical
problems that the students
must solve.”’

In its search to solve the pro-

blems Shakespeare has posed
for it, the 21-member ‘‘Total
Theatre” class has borrowed

heavily from constructivistic
art and French surrealist
painter Marc Chagall.

The set is designed along the
lines of constructivism with
numerous ramps and moving
parts.

“This is the kind of play in
which you want people to have a
lot of movement,” explained
Gordon. “There are many
magic entrances and exits, and
the set has to be designed with
those in mind. I think the
students have done an excellent
job along with Tom Zeigler,
assistant professor of drama, of
creating a set that lends itself to
this play.”

As for Chagall’s influence
Gordon noted that the lighting
and backdrops were inspired by
the French artist’s work.

“Chagall was taken as an in-
spiration because of the colors
and the dream-like quality of
his paintings. He even did a
painting called ‘A Midsummer
Night’s Dream’ and was very
fond of the play,”’ Gordon said.
‘The study of this artist by the
class is meant to give a sur-

realistic quality to the produc-
tion.”

One other area in which the
students had great input in-
volves costuming. Much of the
play takes place within a magic
forest. And, as Gordon explain-
ed, the characters entering that
forest are attired in rather
bland costumes. During their
Stay in the forest their costumes
begin to become more colorful
through the addition of
materials to the costumes.

“‘By the final scene outside
the forest there is a great deal
of color with the costumes,”’
Gordon said.

There are 26 persons on the
cast and, in addition to the W&L
students, the play features
several students from Lex-
ington High School.

Included among the lead
characters are W&L junior
Chris Cartmill of Lincoln, Neb.,
as Oberon; drama instructor
Paula Langdon as Titania;
W&L freshman Joel James as
Lysander; and, Lexington High
School student Sarah Phemister
as Hermia; W&L junior Ted
Petrides as Bottom; and, Kate
Settle, an exchange student at
W&L, as Helena.

The Men’s Cargo

By BRIAN J. OLIGER
Phi Staff Writer

Ah, yes, Men At Work...The
refreshingly zany Australian
band that introduced the
vegemite sandwich to the free
world and asked the immortal
question, “‘Who Can It Be
Now?” While the band’s debut
album is still riding Billboard’s
Top Ten more than a year after
its release in the U.S., their
follow-up project, Cargo, seems
destined to ride a similar wave
of success. The formula in-
troduced on Business As Usual is
utilized again on this album.
That formula calls for almost
nonsensical lyrics which tease
the imagination, through sim-
ple but tuneful melodies and
loose rhythms.

Lead guitarist and vocalist
Colin Hay has clearly emerged
as the leader of the Men,
although Greg Ham_ on
keyboards, sax, flute, and 101
other instruments is certainly
the most talented and versatile
musician of the bunch. Hay
writes the bulk of.the band’s
material, but once again
rhythm guitarist Ron Strykert
has lent a couple of his own
compositions to the album.

The single ‘‘Overkill,’’ which
may already be a candidate for
the ruined-by-too-much-airplay
hall of fame, is nevertheless a
fine example of the tuneful

melodies which Cargo appears
to have inherited from _ its
predecessor. It has a catchy
melody with predictable curves
and loops and ups and downs,
but at the same time there is
about it an unpredictable hook
just when the lyrics need it.
Hay’s nasal vocals have a child-
like appeal which makes the
‘‘implication/complica-
tion/imagination/situation’’
rhyme most agreeable when
placed on top of the music. ‘‘Dr.
Heckle and Mr. Jive’ and
“Highwire” are further ex-
amples of the effectiveness of
this technique.

For MTVaholics, ‘Overkill’’
is a textbook for rock video, as
are the earlier ‘‘Who Can It Be
Now?” and ‘“‘Down Under.”’ It is
more serious in nature (no Men
hopping around the Mojave
desert in underwear), but it is
very well directed.

Finally, when Business As
Usual came out, its sound was
unique, to say the least. It was
one of those rare LP’s that
critics and audiences agreed
was good. Here a band had
come up with a sound that was
new, danceable, refreshing, and
downright fun; and they did it
without resorting to bizarre
amplification techniques or an
army of computers and syn-
thesizers. Cargo has established
this sound as more than a novel-

ty.

Barry Flint pleaded guilty in
March 1982 to charge of stealing
$280 from the Hop-In store on
North Main St. Flint was placed
on probation. Jack Purvis

pleaded guilty on May 20, 1982
to charges of grand larceny and
Statutory burglary. He was

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner to
12 years in prison.

Purvis testified to the State

attention of then Captain Kirby.

‘“‘At the time Kirby was Cap-

Haig: bargaining
through strength

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

Foreign policy is a test of
character and Americans must
“avoid the delusions of the ear-
ly 70s” when detente replaced
strength, said former Secretary
of State Gen. Alexander M.
Haig.

In a short speech before
several thousand people at
Virginia Military Institute’s
graduation on Tuesday, Haig
stressed the need for a balance
between ‘“‘the dialectic of pieties
and manipulation” in pursuit of
American foreign policy goals.

In the past, he said, too much
emphasis has been placed on
ideals.

“We cannot expect signifi-
cant reductions in nuclear
arms,” he said, ‘‘unless the
Soviet leadership is convinced
that we have the courage of our
convictions.”

Haig’s speech coincides with
the resumption of U.S.-Soviet
talks in Geneva on limiting
medium-range missiles in
Western Europe. The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
plans to deploy 572 Pershing II
and cruise missiles in five coun-
tries at the end of this year.

‘Meanwhile, in Moscow, a
senior Soviet official, Anatoly

Alexandrov, threatened Tues-
day that the Soviet Union would
adopt a. policy of ‘‘automatic
retaliation...at all targets on the
territories of all potential
enemies” if new American
medium-range nuclear
weapons are placed in Europe. ]

Haig said that proponents of
the nuclear freeze might bring
about the outcome they are try-
ing to prevent by leaving
America in a poor bargaining
position.

America must be willing and
able ‘“‘to punish infractions”
anywhere in the world, he said.

Haig also cited ‘‘the
emergence of nuclear schizo-
phrenia”’ in Western Europe as
a major obstacle for American
foreign policy.

Europeans are suffering from
two paranoias, he said: a con-
cern in the early 1970s that
America would never be willing
to trade Washington for
Moscow and a concern since
1979 that America might indeed
go to nuclear war, but confine it
to Western Europe.

Haig is a senior fellow with
the Hudson Institute, which
specializes in national security
research. He was supreme
allied commander in Europe
from 1974-1979 and Secretary of
State from 1980-82.

by, if you went to him to make
an allegation like that he would
sort of get mad at you. He didn’t
like for you to do that. So I guess
that’s why he was never told
anymore than he was. Lots of
times you could tell Kirby and
later he would say you didn’t
tell him,” Purvis said.

“To your knowledge Jack, did
he ever follow up on any of this
stuff that you told him?’’ Chap-
man asked.

“‘Not that I know of,” Purvis
said.

The statements by Purvis and
Hamilton indicate that Kirby
might have known about the
unusual activities of police of-
ficers on the late-night shifts.
Kirby has denied any knowl-
edge of the theft ring during his
six years as police chief.

Former officer Donald Stub-
blefield testified to the State
Police that he was warned by a
veteran officer not to rely on
other officers for support in
dangerous situations.

“And, like I say, they told me
not to be in a hurry to go toa
fight, because they were slow to
back you up, if you get in there
and get hurt. And like I say, that
it had been rumored that they,
you know, do take stuff,”’ Stub-
blefield said.

“You think these rumors
were prevalent enough that the
supervisor in the Department
would have been aware of it?”
Special Agent L.F. Craft asked.

“I don’t know, just between
the men and myself. I really
don’t know,”’ Stubblefield said.

As a new officer on the force
in 1981, Stubblefield quickly
learned of the theft ring. The in-
vestigation by Walters resulted
in part from the questions rais-
ed by the testimony of Hamil-
ton, Purvis and Stubblefield.

The Walters report should
have determined how a rookie
patrolman could have learned
so quickly of the theft ring while
Chief Kirby never learned of it
in more than ten years of rising
through the ranks to become
chief, and, according to Hamil-
ton and Purvis, being told on at
least two occasions by his of-
ficers that others were acting

suspiciously on the late-night ©

shift.

The FOI Act preamble em-
bodies a fundamental! principle
of American government.

“It is the purpose of the
General Assembly by providing
this chapter to ensure to the
people of this Commonwealth
ready access to records in the
custody of public officials and
free entry to meetings wherein
the business of the people is be-
ing conducted. This chapter
recognizes that the affairs of

government are not intended to”

be conducted in an atomsphere
of secrecy since at all times the
public is to be the beneficiary of
any action taken at any level of
government. To the end that the

of this chapter may be
realized, it shall be liberally
construed to promote an in-
creased awareness by all per-
sons of governmental activities
and afford every opportunity to
citizens to witness the opera-

tions of government. Any ex-
ception or exemption shall be
narrowly construed in order
that no thing which should be
public may be hidden from any
person,”’ the Act says.

The people of Lexington have
a right to see for themselves
how the Walters report deals
with the publicly raised ques-
tion of Kirby’s possible know}-
edge of the theft ring. Kirby’s
salary has been and will be paid
in the future with their tax
dollars. It is the responsibility
of the Police Department to pro-
tect and serve the Lexington
community. Whether or not Kir-
by knew of the theft ring and
took no action to stop it is a mat-
ter of public business if he is to
remain as a law enforcement
officer.

Yet, the Walters report has
been handled in an atomsphere
of secrecy. Council has met only
in executive session to discuss
the report. City Manager Doane
has repeatedly denied requests
by the news media for inter-
views to ask questions about the
report. And finally, the Mayor
and City Council have cited six
exemptions of the FOI Act as
allowing them to withhold the
document from the public view.

The FOI Act should not be us-
ed in this case as an instrument
to withhold information from
the people of Lexington. Mayor
Phillips and City Council should
at least disclose the factual
determinations of the Walters
report which deal directly with
the question of Kirby’s possible
knowledge of the theft ring.

South African stresses strategic issues,

downplays racial problems in

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

Deloray van Tonder, senior
information officer and Third
Secretary of the South African
Embassy, began his speech
Monday night by proposing to
share a ‘glimpse of the realities
of my country.”

Speaking before 50 people in
duPont auditorium, van Tonder
first explained the vital U.S.
economic interests in South
Africa. Because of its mineral
wealth, South Africa finds itself
increasingly involved in global
politics. Furthermore, its
strategic position between the
Atlantic and Indian oceans and
its decidedly pro-Western
government accentuate its
practical importance.

‘“‘Three thousand vessels —80
percent of OPEC’s oil to the
West, passes by the tip of South
Africa. Seventy percent of the

West’s strategic mineral sup-
plies either originate in or pass
by South Africa on their way to
their destination. Twenty-five
percent of Europe’s food sup-
plies pass by South Africa,” van

'Tonder said, adding that a re-

cent Defense Department study
showed that 2.4 million barrels
of U.S. oil imports enter South

African waters each day.
Stressing South Africa’s
strategic importance, van

Tonder called his country the
“Persian Gulf of minerals.”
Twenty-five out of thirty metals
deemed vital to U.S. military
and technological needs are ex-
ported principally by South
Africa. The U.S. alone depends
on South Africa for 50 percent of
its raw mineral and metal im-
ports.

“In 1979, 93 percent of the
U.S. imported platinum, 76 per-
cent of its cobalt, 44 percent of
its manganese and 47 percent of
its chromium came from South
Africa,’ van Tonder said.

These metals are vital to jet-
engine and high-technology pro-
duction.

South Africa’s economic
stability also stands out,
especially in comparison to the
rest of the African continent.
South Africa accounts for 25
percent of the combined
African GNP, yet it houses only
6 percent of the continent’s
population. Van Tonder pointed
out that South Africa has engag-
ed its neighbors in varied
economic projects to revitalize
the region. An_ extensive,
cooperative transportation net-
work has linked South Africa’s
landlocked neighbors to major
ports. South Africa has‘ also
helped establish a joint com-
munication network and has
helped fund the construction of
hydroelectric dams.
Agriculturally, South Africa ex-
ports large amounts of wheat
and maize to its neighbors.

Van Tonder could not avoid
discussing South Africa’s racial
problems. Seeking to defuse
criticisms of ‘‘apartheid’’
(South Africa’s official policy of
racial discrimination), he
outlined a 3-point plan designed
to lessen racial tensions and to
give limited self-rule to South
Africa’s black majority.

“The first step involves the
creation of a new constitution
creating a tricameral govern-
ment — ‘three-house govern-
ment’ you Americans say — for
whites, coloreds and Asians,”’
van Tonder said.

A second step would involve
the confederation of South
African states (excluding the
black, tribal ‘‘nation-states’’) in
an economic, political and
cultural forum. This forum
would advise the new President
of the country.

Thirdly, blacks in urban
areas would be given ad-
ministrative autonomy and self-
government.

“The goal of this policy is to
give self-determination to each
national group,’’ van Tonder
said. ‘“‘No racial group should
be dominant over the others.”’

While stoping short of ad-
vocating a ‘‘one man-one vote”’
policy for blacks, van Tonder

did emphasize that the incum-
bent Prime Minister, P.W.
“Peter the Weapon’”’ Botha (a

speech

moderate), ‘‘believes blacks
should participate in constitu-
tional reform.”

“South Africa has embarked
on political reform, a departure
from exclusive, white, political
reform. This policy gives
political control to the coloreds
and Asians,”’ he said.

“No other country has the
diversity in languages, culture,
and social customs as does
South Africa. These differences
cannot be solved by political
reform alone,” van Tonder
noted.

Continuing his discussion of
the racial issue, van Tonder
noted that since 1975, nearly $2
billion has been spent on hous-
ing for blacks, resulting in the
construction of an average 100
houses per day. In 1979, black
workers began receiving unem-
ployment compensation in
South Africa.

The whole reform movement,
however, has been placed in
jeopardy by the recent election
victories of the far-right whites,
van Tonder warned.

“The elections concern me
and should concern you. There
is a strong conservative at-
titude in South Africa, and the
election results show how hard
it would be to start on the road
of dynamic change — of evolu-
tion, not revolution. The support
the right attracted during the
elections shows there is a feel-
ing that Botha is selling out to
the blacks, just as Zimbabwe
was sold out.’ That scares the
whites.

“There are 20 million blacks
governed by 4.5 million whites.
the blacks have different cul-
tures and histories. They have
clearly distinct tribes and na-
tions with virtually no inter-
communications,”’ van Tonder
explained. ‘‘I cannot see ‘one
man-one vote’ coming to South
Africa because it will not work
in South Africa. I doubt it would
ever work in South Africa.
There is a high value placed on
ethnicity by the black tribes,
and political (much less social)
cooperation is unlikely.’

“You cannot compare South
Africa to the United States. It
must be seen in the context of
the African continent with the
problems of ethnicity in
Africa,” van Tonder said.

director of

alumni

Richard B. Sessoms,

 

j services, assistant director of

associate director of develop-
ment at Washington and Lee
University, has been named
director of alumni programs at
W&L, effective July 1.

Sessoms will also serve as ex-
ecutive secretary of the
Washington and Lee Alumni
Association, Inc.

He succeeds William C.
Washburn, who is retiring as
alumni secretary after 25 years
in that post. Washburn will be
moving to the university’s of-
fice of development where he
will serve as an associate direc-
tor and will be involved
primarily in the area of estate
planning.

Announcement of the
Sessoms appointment was
made jointly by Washington
and Lee President John D.
Wilson and G. Russell Ladd III
of Mobile, Ala., president of the
alumni board.

The announcement was made

Saturday, May 14, during the
_annual meeting of the W&L
alumni, which was held as part
of the reunion weekend ac-
tivities.

“We are quite pleased that
Dick Sessoms has agreed to ac-
cept this new appointment
within the university and are
confident that he will be as suc-
cessful as the director of alumni
programs as he was with his
development duties during the
final stages of our development
program,”’ Wilson said.

Sessoms joined the develop-
ment office staff at W&L in 1980.

A graduate of Hamden-
Sydney College, he was pre-
viously associate director of the
Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges from 1978
until 1980 and was for 15 years
prior to that an officer of the
Colonial Williamsburg Founda-
tion.

Formerly a writer for the
Roanoke Times, Sessoms was
sports information director and
athletic business manager at
Virginia Military Institute in
Lexington from 1960 until 1963
when he joined. the Colonial
Williamsburg staff as a press
bureau staff writer. He also
served as manager of broadcast

 

public relations, and director of
special events at Williamsburg.

Sessoms is currently presi-
dent of the Historic Lexington
Foundation and serves as facul-
ty adviser to the W&L chapter
of Phi Gamma Delta social
fraternity. He is former presi-

sity conferred Distinguished
Alumnus executive Adrian L.
McCardell of Baltimore, and at-
torney Sherwood Willing Wise
of Jackson, Miss., during the
annual spring alumni reunion
activities on the campus Satur-
day, May 14.

Selected by the board of
directors of the W&L Alumni
Association, the awards were
announced at the annual
meeting of the association in
Lee Chapel.

Foltz received his law degree
from Washington and Lee in
1940 and began a legal practice
which saw him edmitted to
practice before the bar in five
states and the U.S. Supreme
Court. During World War II, he
served with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, risng from
special agent to admiuistrative
assistant to the director.

Following the FBI years, he
entered the business world and
held executive positions in the
Borg-Warner Cory oration
before moving to the Campbell
Soup Company in 1953.

After retiring from the Camp-
bell Soup Company, Foltz
returned to the legal profession
when he joined the Philadelphia

law firm of Hepburn, Willcox,
Hamilton and Putnam.

McCardell graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1929 and
went on to earn his M.B.A.
degree from Harvard. His
career as a bank examiner was
interrupted by World War II in
which he served as a com-
mander in the U.S. Navy.

Following the war he joined
Seaboard National Bank of Nor-
folk as vice-president and, in
1956, he moved to the Charles-
ton, W.Va. Nationa] Bank in a
similar capacity. In 1959 he
became vice president of the
First National Bank of
Maryland, serving there suc-
cessively as vice president, ex-
ecutive vice president, presi-
dent, chairman of the board of
directors, and chairman of the

Ratline builds mental and and physical toughness

ferently. We treat everybody
the same. If they can’t handle
it, if they don’t like it, if they’re
not willing to accept what we’re
doing, then they can go. I won’t
feel bad.”’

An inspiration for the rats is
the knowledge that for the next
three years, they will have the
opportunity to confer similar
hardships on the incoming rats.

Marks is in that position. One
year ago he was a rat. Now, he
is a cadre corporal; thus, it is
his duty to ‘‘deal with’’ the rats.

“IT guess by being on the
receiving end, the giving end
was not difficult, simply
because I’ve been through it
before’ he explained. ‘‘You feel
less sympathetic when giving
discipline. You feel what
they’re going through, but not to
the extent that you alter how
you go about it.

“It’s a lot easier to see things
you thought were pointless and
worthwhile now aren’t. You can
understand the rationale and
reasoning behind things you
couldn’t when you were the
recipient. There is a job, with
people who are charged with
disciplining and_ training
(them).

“I know what it did for me
and what it will do for them,
even though it doesn’t feel
good,’’ he said.

Even the current rats seem to
understand the importance of
the abuse they are subjecting
themselves to.

“You can talk about (the
ratline) all day,” said Simpson,
‘‘but you have to go through it to
realize what it really is. (Its)
goal is trying to build
character, trying to make you a

better person. I think it was suc-
cessful.

“I can’t think of any parts of
it that were unnecessary. It af-
fects you academically, but
that’s a part of it. It was hard at
first, adjusting, but you have to
get used to it. I’m _ proud
because I went through it.”’

Luke Sossi, a fourth classman
from New Windsor, concurred.
“IT have an older brother who
goes here, and he filled me in,
but you have to live it to under-
stand it.

‘*You never really had time to
think about it. You were con-
stantly on the move. It has
brought a stronger pride in
myself, and an appreciation of
what I can do. Looking back at
it, it was all necessary.” Sossi
said.

Even Dunahoe had problems
his rat year.

‘I didn’t know what was go-
ing on. I had never seen the
place; I was from Texas. I was
led around and bustled around
so much I didn’t know where I
was.

‘‘When I finally got a chance
to think about it that night, I
was ready to go. By the time I
had just fallen asleep, it seemed
they kicked in the doors to get
me up again. I didn’t have too
much chance to think about
anything. I didn’t like it,’’ he
remembered.

“I was happy to get through
the next day, I couldn’t fathom
four years.”’

One accusation that has often
been leveled at VMI concerns
hazing, the deliberate physical
abuse of a rat. Existence of this
practice in private has been ex-
pressed by some cadets, but,

according to policy, it is illegal.
A cadet was dismissed earlier
this year for shoving a rat
against a wall.

‘‘When I was a rat, they
couldn’t touch us, as far as hit-
ting us or anything,” explained
Dunahoe.

‘There has been a policy this
year that you don’t lay hands on
anybody in an aggressive sort
of sense. None of this, to my
knowledge, went on in an ‘I’m
going to beat you to death’
sense.”’

The major and most in-
timidating punishment for a rat
is to be called before the Rat
Disciplinary Committee.

“The RDC, as I saw it,” said
Dunahue, ‘‘was an obstacle the
rats could only overcome if they
banded together and worked
together. Our purpose wasn’t to
weed people out, or kick people
out, or get rid of people we don’t
like. It was to build them.”’

When a rat is charged with an
offense, like failure to know per-
tinent information or taking
another class’s privileges, he
receives a card to appear
before the RDC.

‘‘He comes up to the fifth
stoop,’ explained Dunahoe,
“and is told how to answer his
card. He then comes into the
room. I’m sitting there with the
vice-president and the sec-
retary and any other members
who are there. He can explain
his offense if he feels it is
justified.

“Invariably they are handed
penalties because they are
always guilty. The penalties
range from workouts to con-

finements. to penalty tours. He
then goes to a workout room
and given a workout from 15 to
30 minutes, depending on the
nature of the offense.”’

Given the intimidating role of
the RDC, the intimidating per-
sonality of Dunahoe is not sur-
prising.

“It’s a role you play,” he em-
phasized. ‘You don’t go home
and beat on your little sister. It
becomes part of your day walk-
ing around with a scowl on your
face looking mean. I don’t think
it was permanently changed
things as far as making me
mean.

“They are supposed to be
scared of you. My primary
function was to enforce the
rules and restrictions set down
by my class and approved by
the superintendent. The best
way to do that is by fear.

‘*T think we had a pretty good
RDC this year. I think many of
(the rats) were afraid of us.
That’s what we wanted. If they
messed up, we wanted them to
be petrified, and they were. We
had guys cry before they got in
the door.”’

Dunahoe remembered that
the corps ran into ‘‘some bugs
early in the year.” The bugs in-
cluded some changes in the
ratline by General Sam Walker,
VMI superintendent. Walker
prohibited ‘‘stereoing,’”’ where
rats have both ears shouted into
at the same time, and rigorous
exercise known as rat training
on the same days they have
physical education classes,
among other things.

“I think it’s all worked out
and we’ve got good communica-
tions going on now between us

and the administration.

‘What we gave out to these
guys this year is basically what
we went through. I can’t even
think of the changes. In fact, it
may be a little tougher what
we’re doing to the rats this year
from what they did to us. I know
this year we implemented a few
things to help them on their
study time, which was a big
pain for them. It was designed
to be a pain, but in the end it
helped them out,” said Dunahoe

But despite the  self-pro-
claimed successes of the
ratline, the esprit de corps it in-
spires, its uniqueness and ap-
parent harshness will constant-
ly keep it under public scrutiny.

“There’s a lot more people
watching us,” said Dunahoe,
“waiting for us to mess up. It
seems that all some people do is
just wait, wanting us to mess
up.

“One of the good things about
the rat system is that it is run by
cadets. The administration,
while providing guidance and
assistance and restrictions, in
certain cases, pretty much
stays out of it. The RDC is run
by us, the class system and
general committee, which en-
forces class privileges, is run by
us.
“I think this is one of the key
aspects, one of the best parts of
our system, Nobody who is en-
forcing it hasn’t gone through it
before, so we know exactly how
they feel, how it is to want to
quit. The first day I got here, I
was going to pack it in,’ he
said.

“It teaches you to keep on go-
ing, to hang in there despite the
odds.”’

Lampost shows Christian signifigance at W&L

By KEITH E. GORETZKA
Special to the Phi

As this school year comes
quickly to an end, I would like to
write a few lines concerning my
experiences in the Christian
community at Washington and
Lee. Having been involved in
the life of that community for
the last four years, I approach
my task with both respect and
apprehension — respect for the
individual believers who have
enriched my life and uncertain-
ty as to whether I will be able to
communicate fully the depth
and power and reality of that
Holy Spirit which dwells in
those individual men and
women.

However, since my head is
spinning with good tales to tell,
let me press on.

The two Christian organiza-
tions at school with which I
have been related are the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship
and Lexington’s Organization
for Religious Development
which owns and operates the
Lampost, a house for the
Washington and Lee under-
graduates with the goal of pro-
viding ‘‘a way for students to
come together, sharing, and
growing in their commitment to
Jesus Christ.” I have par-
ticipated in the fellowship of
worship and study in the com-
munity of Lexington through
Manly Memorial Baptist

Brock warns

U.S. Trade Representative
William E. Brock told a
Washington and Lee University
audience Thursday night that it
is ‘‘an act of national insanity to
let our educational system go
down as it has for 20 con-
secutive years.”

A 1953 graduate of
Washington and Lee, Brock was
the keynote speaker for the
university’s spring reunions.

Brock, who is President
Reagan’s personal represen-
tative in all matters concerning
foreign trade, prefaced his
remarks on what he sees as a
deterioration in the educational
system by praising the United
States ‘‘as the most productive
country in the histoty of
mankind by any measure what-
soever.”’

“Overall the American peo-
ple ... are approximately 65 per-
cent more productive than the
Japanese, who are viewed as
our toughest competitor,”’
Brock said. “We don’t talk
about that. We don’t think about
that ... We spend all our time
talking about how bad we are,
how inadequate we are.”’

But Brock added that if there
is one thing that will determine
where the United States is 20
years from now, it will be our
ability to turn the educational
system around.

“Better than 25 percent of our
young people are graduating
from high school as functional

Church and outside of our city
at Christian fellowships at the
surrounding girls’ schools. With
an active Fellowship of Chris-
tian Athletes at Washington and
Lee and the support of believers
on faculty at both our university
and Virginia Military Institute
there has been no lack of Chris-
tian community for me these
last four years. Rather than
talk of organizational structure
or provide a chronology of my
growth as a believer in this fer-
tile community, let me instead
relate some of those ‘‘good
tales’’ mentioned above. The
New Testament is, among other
things, a compilation of the sus-
taining experiences of the early
church. Here are a few sustain-
ing experiences from my four
years in the Washington and
Lee Christian community.

One morning, not so very long
ago, I arose a little earlier than
usual to finish up some busy
work left undone the night
before. At exactly 7:30 the
sound of a guitar being soulfully
strummed reached my ears and
I knew that it was time to head
for the kitchen of the Lampost.
What I found in that room were
several sleepy-eyed students
who had gathered in their morn-
ing ritual of Psalm singing and
prayer. The numbers vary from
day to day (‘I thought Robert
was going to set the alarm,”
“But, Mo, I did set it. You just
overslept’’) and the singing has

of rising illiterac

cannot even cope with life. They
cannot read, write, or count.
Fifty-three percent of the
students surveyed in a recent
study could not write a letter. I
don’t understand what has hap-
pened to the righeous indigna-
tion of the people in this coun-
try.”

Brock said that the average
student coming out of school 10
years from now will have to be
“more flexible’ and ‘more
mentally competent in order to
cope with the changes in cir-
cumstance.”’

With the advent and increas-
ed use of robotics and com-
puters, said Brock, workers in
the future will ‘“‘be using their
where are we going to be if we
can’t get anybody to hold the
jobs?”’

“We can’t teach our children
science and math because we
don’t have science and math
teachers,’’ Brock added.
“That’s just a little example of
what we have let happen to
ourselves.”’

Brock suggested that those in
the audience, many of whom
were his former classmates,
consider a recent proposal that
businesses ‘‘adopt” schools as a
method of helping improve the
educational system.

Businesses could make
schools, from grammar schools
to colleges, ‘‘a project’? and
could “find a way to supple-
ment teachers’ salaries so we
get better quality teachers,”
Brock said.

a peculiar froggy quality to it.
Yet for all their foibles the
faithful do gather pretty
regularly to remember God and
request His Divine Assistance.
On this particular morning
there were thanks offered for
the beauty of the Valley and
petitioning for an uneventful
birth of a child. This ritual in
which I was participating was
eminently uneventful. And yet
for all of its insignificance the
memory of that morning time
holds an honored position in my
mind.

There is a Washington and
Lee graduate, now living in
Roanoke, whom I consider one
of those men of faith that so
very rarely graces a communi-
ty. Full of strength and wisdom
and abundant sensitivity. I was
deeply impressed by this last
quality, again, in what would
seem a most uneventful oc-
curence.

In a typical school day we
probably offend half a dozen
people in completely unknown
ways by a facial expression or
harried comment. At the end of
such a day my friend came to
me and asked my forgiveness
for what he percieved as an
unkindness on his part toward
me earlier in the day. I cannot
recall now what that unkind-
“ness may have been and most
probably had difficulty in
remembering it even at our
meeting. What I do carry in my

   
 

y in the USA

memory is the thought that this
man was so very sensitive to
my frightfully frail ego that he
came with apologies to me
when none were expected or re-
quired. Another set of in-
significance, yet one which I
will never forget.

Some weeks ago, I was
washing up my morning
breakfast dishes when surpris-
ed by a female voice behind me.
I turned to see a young Hollins
student, dressed for church less
two misplaced shoes, and most
desirous of helping me with the
dishes. Well, I didn’t need her
assistance but I was rather in-
trigued by her presence as it
turned out that she had slept in
my home, the Lampost, the
night before without my know-
ledge.

It seems that she had a rather
bad time of it with her date the
previous evening and had
shown up on our doorstep at 2
a.m., suitcase in hand, in need
of a place to stay. One of the
brothers just happened to be up
typing a paper and he found her
an unoccupied bedroom for the
night.

After listening to her story,
finding her lost shoes, and see-
ing her on her way, I paused to
consider this third, uneventful
experience. Girls have ‘‘a bad
time of it” here in Lexington
more often than I care to admit
and putting up a friend for the
night is not all that uncommon

in a college town. What did
strike was that I had to jog my
memory for a minute before
remembering the name of that
particular girl when I turned to
see her in the kitchen. It struck
me that a girl to whom I had to
provide the most rudimentary
instructions in navigating the
complex road system of Lex-
ington the next morning should
try to find the Lampost at two in
the morning the previous night.

These facts shouldn’t have
seemed uncommon to me.
Christians have been offering
sanctuary to the world-weary
for centuries. As the girl turned
the corner and left my sight I
decided that, indeed, an event
had occurred, The compassion
of the Risen Lord had been ex-
perienced by yet another so-
journer.

We can read the Holy Scrip-
tures and be inspired by the
stories related therein. In look-
ing back upon my memories of
the Christian community at
Washington and Lee, I realize
that the Spirit which dwelt in
the hearts of those early
believers is alive and well this
very day at our university.

An old Southern adage says
that once ‘“‘Fear knocked at the
door. Faith answered. There
was no one there.” I have no
fear that the Christian com-
munity at Washington and Lee
will continue so long as men and
women dare to be insignificant.

McBryde breaks records
en route to NCAAs

With a record-setting perfor-
mance in Charlottesville last
weekend, Washington and Lee
track standout Angus McBryde
qualified to compete in the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ships set for May 23-28 at North
Central College near Chicago,
Illinois.

McBryde, a junior from
Charlotte, N.C., will participate
in the 1500-meter competition
which includes trials on Thurs-
day the 26th and finals on Satur-
day. The top 14 runners in the
trials will advance to the finals.

McBryde qualified for the
NCAA meet by turning in a 3-
minute, 53.6-second time last
Sunday afternoon in the third
annual ‘Cavalier Classic’’ held
at the University of Virginia
and sponsored by Blue
Cross/Blue Shield. In addition
to earning him the trip to the
NCAA meet, the performance
shattered the W&L_ school
record of 3:59.5 set in 1978 by
Richard Bird.

McBryde broke one other
school record at the Classic. On
Saturday he clocked in at 14
minutes, 54.1 seconds in the
5000-meter race to eclipse the
15:11.7 standard he had set
April 9 in Norfolk. McBryde
now holds three W&L marks,
the third one a 9:01 in the 3000-
meter run (set in January,
1983).

He becomes the third General
to compete in the NCAA Divi-
sion III Championships during
the meet’s 10-year history.
Sprinter Phifer Harris and high
jumper Tony Perry par-

ticipated in the 1974 event.
Perry appeared again in 1975.

McBryde holds three W&L
letters in track and two in cross
country. He won the 1500 and
5000 races at the 1983 ODAC
Outdoor Championships on
April 30 and the 1500 at the 1982
ODAC meet. He placed second
in the ODAC cross country
championships last fall.

He will serve as cross country
captain this coming season with
Charlie Alcorn, and next year

as track captain with Chris

Ives.

Bees sting Generals 14-12

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Sports Writer

A bit of lacrosse history was
made at the University of
Baltimore Saturday, as _ the
Bees scored four goals in the
opening three and a_ half
minutes in route to a 14-12 vic-
tory over Washington and Lee.

The Generals’ loss ended
their first losing season (5-7)
since 1969, when W&L was 1-8.
Between then and this season,
W&L compiled a winning per-
centage of better than 70 per-
cent with a total of 133 victories.

The game also was the last
for Baltimore’s intercollegiate
program. The university decid-
ed to give up athletics after this
season.

W&L coach Jack Emmer ex-
pected Baltimore to start its
last game ever with great inten-
sity, but he was still disap-
pointed that his team was over-
whelmed in the early going.

‘“‘We knew that it would be

tough to match their emotional
level,’”’ Emmer said. ‘They
played flawlessly for three
quarters, like they were putting
on a clinic. They made us look
like we weren’t ready to play.”

Chuck Muir scored his game-
high five goals and Greg Man-
ley fired in three more during
the first three quarters to give
the Bees leads of 10-3 at the half
and 13-6 at the end of the third
quarter. John Doub put in
W&L’s first two goals.

Baltimore built its big lead in
spite of being outshot, 26-21, in
the first half, with goalie Vinnie
Pfeiffer collecting 14 saves.

Remarked Emmer, “Their
goalie turned out to be the dif-
ference for them. He played ex-
ceptionally well. But we helped
him by shooting a lot to his stick
side.”’

W&L rebounded in the fourth
quarter with a 6-1 charge that
included four extra-man goals.
Jeff Mason had two goals and
Geoff Wood notched his team-

 

 

leading 28th goal and 12th assist
in the rally. Doub and Joe
Seifert tallied in the last
minute. Doub’s gave him 17 for
the year, second on the team to
Wood.

“We didn’t accomplish our
goal of finishing .500, which is
kind of blemish for us,’’ said
Enimer, “but Baltimore was

tough.”

Emmer described the re-
cruits who have accepted ad-
mission to the school as being
“good, but not great. It’s a
larger quantity this year. We
have about four to five at-
tackmen, three to four middies,
three to four defensemen and a
goalie.”

He added that next year’s
schedule will include Navy,
Maryland-Baltimore County,
Duke, Virginia, Towson State,
Loyola of Baltimore, Delaware,
Maryland, and William and
Mary.

 

 

 

Time Out....

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

Friday night American
capitalism and stupidity (often
identical twins, it seems) make
an appearance in (where else? )
Las Vegas with boxing’s bash,
courtesy Champion Don “Just
out to make a buck”’ King and a
cast of thousands. To begin
with, the sport — and I use the
term only as a last resort — is
ludicrous. If they want a real
challenge, they might as well
use clubs; and why not fight to
the death? Oh, I guess they do
that already. But back to capi-
talism. It’s only in America
where you can grow up to earn
millions while at the same time
getting your head pounded in.

But the amount of money is
another story. The question in
my mindis: If they’re really not
concerned over the money
aspect of the championship
itself; why not have Larry
Holmes (current WBC cham-
pion) fight Michael Dokes (cur-
rent WBA champion) matched
up to decide the undisputed
champion rather than the two
continually fighting lesser con-
tenders? Oh, but then there’d be
no gimmick. Heaven forbid, for
then what would Mr. King do?
The extravaganza in Vegas
with all its trappings just leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.
Somehow the amateur sport
that takes place every four
years at the Olympics has
become the professional show

 

Four named All-Conference

Senior outfielder Chris
Cavalline heads a list of four
Washington and Lee baseball
standouts who received All-
Conference honors Tuesday,
May 10 from the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Cavalline
earned a spot on the 12-man All-
Conference first team, while
senior shortstop Jody Harris,
senior outfielder Jim Daly, and
sophomore pitcher Billy White
were named to the 11-man se-
cond team.

“Chris, Jody, and Jim played
some of the best baseball Smith
Field has seen in quite a while,”
states second-year head coach
Jim Murdock. “Chris is pro-
bably the best four-year per-
former W&L’s ever had; Jody
was unmatched as a leader and
spark plug, and Jim was one of
our more confident performers.
Billy, meanwhile, is building a

reputation as one of W&L’s best
pitchers ever.”

W&L’s leader at the plate this
season, Cavalline compiled a
team-high .407 batting average,
35 hits, 25r atted-in, and 25
runs-scored. His hit total includ-
ed nine doubles, two triples, and
a homerun.

A four-year starter and letter-
man, Cavalline’s career
statistics feature a .364 batting
average, 123 hits, 64 RBIs, and
82 runs-scored in 94 total
games. He is only the second
General to receive first-team
baseball honors in the con-
ference’s seven-year history

(Thad Ellis earned the award in
1980).
Harris, who served with

Cavalline as team captain this
season, was W&L’s chief thief
with 15 stolen bases in 16 at-
tempts. He also batted .256, lac-

ed 23 hits, and scored 23 runs.
During his four-year career he
pilfered 38 bases, batted .260,
collected 78 hits, and scored 65
runs in 87 games.

Daly posted a .297 batting
average this spring on 27 hits.
He also scored 20 runs and
drove in 14. His three-year
career statistics include a .292
batting average, 61 hits, and 41
runs-scored in 64 games.

Righthander White was
leader on the mound for a se-
cond straight season. He com-
piled a 5-2 record and. 3.86
earned-run average on 53.7 in-
nings pitched in nine ap-
pearancés. He struck out 34 bat-
ters. White’s two-year ledger
features a 6-5 record and 3.77
ERA on 98 innings pitched in 19
appearances. He has 62 career
strikeouts.
