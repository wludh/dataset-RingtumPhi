Noise violation dispute settled

by Rob Schlegel
and John Cleghorn

Thanks to a meeting involving Interfraternity Council President
Mason Ellerbe, Chi Psi Danny Einstein, and Lexington police
Lieutenant Bruce Beard, there is now an agreement concerning
noise violations for fraternity houses.

At the September 14 meeting of the IFC, both Einstein and
Ellerbe presented the results of the previous day’s meeting with
Beard.

Lexington police officers have a three step format to follow for
noise violations. First, the officers will not visit a fraternity house
unless there is a citizen’s complaint or unless they can hear the
music at least 50 feet from the house. Secondly, if there is a com-
plaint, the particular officer will give the fraternity a written warn-
ing. It will be signed by four members of the fraternity whose
names will be turned into the IFC. Finally, if there is no response to
the warning, a violation will be the next course of action.

“We'll give a little and they’ll give a little,” said IFC Treasurer
Emery Ellinger. ‘‘The IFC has come to an agreement with the
townspeople and with the police. It’s a friendly situation.”

The new rule differs greatly from previous rules concerning
noise violations, which were left vague and resulted in numerous
misunderstandings between fraternities and the local police.

Lt. Beard stressed the point to Einstein and Ellerbe that if the
W&L fraternities abuse this priviledge, they will lose it. According
to Ellerbe, Beard seemed quite sincere in agreeing with this plan.

The Lexington police officer also asked that the fraternities try to

keep townspeople out of their parties. In addition he suggested that
the fraternities talk to any neighbors who might complain about
noise from a party and try to settle things before a party takes
place.
- Another problem brought up at this Monday meeting was park-
ing. A number of cars have been towed for parking violations ac-
cording to Beard. Much of the problem is caused by girls from the
surrounding schools, Ellerbe noted. Letters will be sent to these
schools informing girls of the parking regulations in Lexington.

The meeting between the two fraternity representatives and
Beard was arranged in order to smooth over difficulties between
W&L fraternities and the Lexington community. Chi Psi President

 

Sunday night and the hourly repeat of a small cannon signaled
fraternity members to shout out freshmen names, and lead them
off to a soda-pop social with the brothers, By the fourth and fifth

was present in large part because his fraternity had a party
mistakenly shut down by the Lexington police last spring.

In disciplinary business, the IFC penalized Kappa Alpha for
disobeying a band rule during Rush last week. According to Steve
Jones, IFC Vice-President, KA contracted bands for Thursday,
Sept.9, and the following Saturday, Sept. 11, which violates the IFC
specification that fraternities are allowed only one band a week
during Rush.

Kappa Alpha received a fine of $150 and two weeks social proba-
tion to begin the Monday following Parents’ weekend, Oct.23.

“The rule was made clear,” explained Jones, ‘‘It seemed to be
clear to all the other fraternities but not to KA. It was an honest
mistake but it was a mistake and we treated it as such.”

KA is the first house to be penalized by the IFC thus far in Rush.

In other matters, the IFC decided to hire someone to pick up
trash in front of fraternities after parties for the remainder of rush
as townspeople had complained of the litter.

Todd Smith, Editor in Chief of the Ring-tum Phi, spoke in front of
the IFC to gather support for his idea of publishing fraternity ex-
penses for freshmen in the newspaper. Smith expressed intention to
write a paragraph or two for each particular fraternity explaining
the costs and what they pay for.

The IFC opposed this idea because it would create a stigma to be
attached to prices, and it would be difficult to describe what a
freshman got for his money. It was suggested that Smith write an
editorial advising freshmen during Rush to ask the fraternity
members about the exact expenses. In addition it was noted that in
many houses, freshmen may join even if they cannot pay the full
expense.

Dean Dan Murphy, in charge of fraternity affairs, mentioned
that he received a call from Southern Seminary concerning signs
advertising for fraternitiy parties. Murphy suggested that the signs
be placed in proper places such as bulletin boards. Murp also
stressed that liquor should not be advertised on these signs because
it might attract ABC officials to the parties.

As for rush, 352 students registered this fall. The IFC members
strongly supported this year’s format involving open contact before

Rush began. It was noted that students signed up for fewer open
houses than last year.

prices
soar

by Alan Armitage

With a jump in book prices
and an over-all increase in the
number of books assigned by
the professors, the Washington
and Lee Bookstore has become
an expensive place to visit.

The price of books published
by the major publishing com-
panies increased by 14.8% in the
calendar year ending Dec. 31,
1981, according to Mrs. Betty
Munger, manager of the book-
store.

Technical books for the
science courses have increased
in price more rapidly than other
books, Mrs. Munger said, but
students taking other courses
are not getting away any
cheaper.

“The Calculus book which I
bought for $23.95 two years ago
now costs $32.90,’’ said junior
Paul Levy, who works in the
bookstore. ‘‘But someone tak-
ing an English course with 5 or 6
paperbacks at $6.00 apiece is
going to end up paying the same
amount for his books.”’

In the past many students
have been able to find used
books which they could borrow
or buy from other students. This
year, though, that will not be as
viable an alternative. ‘Many of
the Chemistry, Economics, and
Religion texts, as well as
others, are new editions,”’ said
Nick Leitch, another junior who
works in the _ bookstore.

Mrs. Munger and Levy said
the bookstore had done between
$60,000 and $70,000 in business
on Monday alone, although
most students had not purchas-
ed all their books. ‘‘Many of the
students I saw today paid from
$110 to $130 for all their books,”’
said Levy.

Many students are upset by
the high prices they have to pay
for their books, but do not
understand that the bookstore
does not generally make a pro-
fit on a year-to-year basis, Mrs.
Munger said. The bookstore did
make a profit last year, but ran
a deficit in 1980-81. ‘The record
store (now defunct) hurt us two
years ago,”’ she said. “But we
made a profit last year from the
sale of Charles Flood’s book

(Lee, The Last Years,) and
that had nothing to do with
texts.”’

Another problem many stu-
dents face in the bookstore is
finding that a book they need is
sold out. Mrs. Munger said that
she tries to avoid that problem
every year and she still runs out
of some books. ‘‘Many pro-
fessors only guess at the
number of students they will
have in a specific course,’’ she
said, ‘‘and I have to take it from
there.”

So far though this year is go-
ing well. ‘‘We’ll just have to
wait and see,’”’ said Mrs
Munger.

# Rush 1982

  
    

by Todd Smith

Rush is in the thick of confusion and excitement this week,
despite last year’s efforts by some to postpone the whole affair a
month or even a term. And it’s doing even better now that freshmen
are given a chance to see the fraternities before they must sign up
for open houses.

But the chance is still there for Rushees to get caught up in the
machinery.

It’s hard for me to imagine myself so naive as to sign up for open
houses in random order, unaware that only the first three were
really serious. That is, however, exactly what I did in the fall of
1979; and last year it was said that one freshman signed up in
alphabetical order.

Freshmen that don’t tune in get tuned out, more often than not. So
the onus is on them to take an aggressive and informed approach.

~Don’t let yourself be strung along. Out of common decency,
some fraternities will be nice to you even when they have no inten-
tion of giving you a bid. You will probably be able to tell how you
stand if you watch for hints and ask questions. —

~Don’t give up. There’s a house for most students who want to be
in a house. And sometimes that house doesn’t know it. I remember
one freshman who started lobbying my fraternity in an intense way
after Rush was over. Intensity is a rarety as most Rushees try to
act cool and uncommitted, but this mink got in.

~ Know the facts. Don’t be afraid to ask, “How much is this real-
ly going to cost me?”’ At some point during Rush, whether even
before getting a bid, go to the treasurer and get an accurate picture
of the price of brotherhood. Some houses will surprise you with
their reasonable rates, others will surprise you with the high cost of
partying. Just don’t be surprised after you have pledged.

Fraternities can help by having an itemized list of expenses to
show those Rushees who ask.

~And, finally, don’t let it all intimidate you. There are abuses,
and some freshmen are ‘“‘caught in the machinery,” but I have yet
to see serious maliciousness in Rush. Every house seriously wants
Rush to be successful and painless, and if freshmen take precau-
tions, ask questions and don’t take it all too seriously, it will be very
successful.

Burned by Playboy?

 

Reproduced from Playboy

Sweet Briar smoulders

by Bill Roberts
Sweet Briar College is described as ‘‘smolder-
ing’’ and ranked at 7th place among 20 colleges in
the October issue of Playboy magazine.
But a spokeswoman for the Amherst, Va., school
dismissed the article as inaccurate in its treat-
ment of Sweet Briar.

Playboy’s Associate Editor Kevin Cook
surveyed students at ten American colleges and
found that sexual attitudes have become more
permissive since the last survey in the 1960s.

But that survey did not include Sweet Briar, said
Janet Lowrey, the college’s public information
director.

The article, “Sex on Campus ’82,” features a

fold-out comic page in which The University of ©

Texas is ranked number one at ‘212 degrees: a
libidinous boil,” while Harvard University is 15th
at ‘‘72 degrees: just too stuffy to be fun.”

The page characterizes Sweet Briar girls as
‘‘preppie milk maids,” but rated them 7th at ‘130
degrees : a lot of smoldering at an all-girl school.”

“Sex Central” for Sweet Briar girls is the
University of Virginia and the hottest hang out on
campus is the UVa gates where all sorts of boys
“roll up’? (a reference to marijuana), the
magazine said.

Those who want to blow off steam at Sweet Briar
go ‘“‘cow tipping;’’ the art of toppling somnolent
bovines, according to the Playboy article.

This isn’t true, Lowrey said. .

“Cow tipping is sort of a legendary thing that
has been talked about but I don’t know of anyone
that has been cow tipping,’ Lowrey said. The
closest cows are at a dairy at Sweet Briar that pro-
vides the college with its milk and butter.

No Sweet Briar students were ever questioned
by Playboy and the campus has never been visited
by Playboy personnel, Lowrey said.

“‘We have talked to Mr. Kevin Cook, the author
of the article, and it appears that they sent out on-
ly 10 questionnaires,’ she said Sweet Briar was
not included in the survey.

“He did a lot of imagining and it wasn’t based on
any factual information;’’ Lowrey said.

According to Lowrey, Cook said he got the infor-
mation about cow tipping and “rolling up’”’ at the
gates from the ‘Yale Insider’s Guide to Colleges,”
a handbook of articles about American colleges
and written by students at Yale University.

As for the sexual temperature; that appears to
have come from rumors, Lowrey said.

“The administration is not really bothered with
it,”’ she said. “It’s not embarrassing in that we
feel it is just the way Playboy operates.”

Lamar Cecil Jr. teaned back in his chair, munched on a Lays
potato chip, and pondered the reasons he left the academically
prestigious University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to accept a
full professorship in the Washington and Lee History department.

“One reason is its size. At the University of North Carolina, I
would walk across campus and see hundreds and hundreds of
students and not a face that I recognized,’’ said Cecil, 50. ‘“‘With a
faculty equal to the size of the student body here, you did well to
know half of your colleagues.

“I also prefer undergraduate teaching to graduate. At Chapel
Hill, you find more and more of your time being spent with
graduate students. W&L is almost exclusively devoted to
undergraduates.

“So I wanted a small, undergraduate school, but what led me to
W&L particularly was the excellence of its reputation. There have
been some very distinguished professors of history — Professor
Jenks himself, Robert Paxton at Columbia, and Henry A. Turner at
Yale — and that was particularly interesting to me,”’ he said.

Cecil was born in Beaumont, Texas, but attended Episcopal High
School in Alexandria, Virginia. He returned west to receive his B.A.
from Rice University in Texas. He received his Ph.D. from Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore where he also had his first
teaching job. He taught at Princeton University as well, before
joining the UNC staff in 1968.

He has written two books, ‘‘Albert Ballin: Business and Polics in
Imperial Germany,”” and “The German Diplomatic Service,
1871-1914."’ Another book, a biography of Wilhelm II, is in the
works.

Eight teachers have joined
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity undergraduate faculty, and
three more have been appointed
to the W&L School of Law facul-

New teachers on the under-
graduate faculty are Peter W.
Bergstrom, assistant professor

of biology; Douglas A. Burns,
instructor in geology; John D.
i Parker, assistant professor of
history; Robert Lee Pour, in-
structor in mathematics; E.
Wyatt Prunty, visiting assistant
professor of English; Debora
Anne Rindge, instructor in fine
arts; Robert Richard Ripple,
assistant professor of military
science; and Larry M. Stene,
assistant professor of fine arts.

The new appointments in the
School of Law are John W. Lar-
son, visiting associate professor
of law; Toni M. Massaro, assis-
tant professor of law; Brian C.
Murchison, assistant professor
of law.

The university earlier an-
nounced the appointment of
Lamar Cecil Jr. as professor of
history. (See story this page. )

‘I see him as one of the most fascinating characters in history,”’
said Cecil. ‘“‘While he was a most unattractive person, he had a
fascination, a sense of...evil. He was almost solely responsible for
World War I in an age where the affairs of the world were control-
led by a tiny handful of aristocratic kings and rulers. It seems
awesome how the personality of one man could affect so many
millions of people.”’ ,

Cecil will only be teaching two classes this term, a section of 101
and a class called the Renaissance. Winter term he will teach a new
class, the Reformation, and he will take over the classes on Russian
history at Jenks’ retirement next year. ‘‘Assuming you all like me
and let me stay,’’ he said with a laugh.

“‘T wanted the advantage of sharing (Jenks’) last year with him. I
will value the experience,”’ he said, explaining why he came a year
before the opening occurred . He said he doesn’t believe he is being
“‘primed”’ to replace Jenks as head of the department and added,
“That is not my intention.”’

Cecil has a wife and two daughters, 3 and 4. “I anticipate they are
going to love growing up here,”’ he said.

A daily swimmer, he has been impressed with the athletic
facilities here, as well as the library (‘‘a splendid undergraduate
collection’’), and the Alumni House coffee every morning.

Cecil said he also believes in the ideas of honor and chivalry that
are supposed to be exemplified by the Washington and Lee student.
He couldn’t comment on their validity though, since he has met few
students. ‘‘You’ll have to come back for a ‘before and after’ inter-

 

view,’’ he said.

applies

by Tom Baker

Washington and Lee received
more applications for this fall’s
freshman class than for any
class ever before, the admis-
sions office has announced.

Of the grand total of applica-
tions —1,605 — the university of-
fered admission to 794 young
men. About 360 accepted and
matriculated.

Robert Huntley, dean of

freshmen, said that the faculty
has found this year’s entering
Students exceptionally well-
acquainted with the catalogue
and the course offerings.
Huntley said that freshmen had
been sent sample schedule plan-
ning material during the sum-
mer.
The class of 1986 includes 23
National Merit Scholars, and 19
who finished first or second in
their high school graduating
class.

Public schools sent more to
fill up the freshmen class than
did private schools: 57 percent
public, 43 private.

The average score of this
year’s freshmen on the verbal
section of the Scholastic Ap-
titude Test was 565; the average
on the math section was 610.

Of the 804 students outside
these special categories who ap-
plied from public schools, 53
percent were accepted, i.e., 426.
Of the 676 who applied from
private schools, only 43 percent
were accepted.

Annual
Fund tops
record

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity received a record $1,279,983
in unrestricted gifts toward the
university’s day-to-day oper-
ating expenses for 1981-82. The
final total reflects an increase
of 9.3 percent over last year’s
total of $1,170,941. This is the
third time in the past three
years that the annual fund at
W&L has exceeded $1 million.

The gifts provided almost 10
percent of the university’s
operating budget.

A center for the study of Washington and Lee’s Reeves porcelain
and Herreshoff paintings was officially opened Saturday.

Dean of the College William Watt praised W&L’s secretary,
James Whitehead, as the ‘‘guiding spirit” behind the restoration of
what was formerly Tucker Annex.

“One of the most important things is that (the collection) is
available for undergraduate study and particularly with that

Foundation, said in a speech Saturday afternoon.

Both the porcelain and the paintings were given to the university
in 1967 by Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin D. Reeves of Providence, R.I. Mr.
Reeves, a 1927 graduate of the W&L law school, and his wife had
collected more than 2,000 items of ceramic art dating from the late
17th century through the first half of the 20th century.

The collection is particularly rich in mid-18th and early 19th cen-
tury Chinese export porcelain, some of which was decorated with
eagles and the stars and stripes to please 19th century Americans.

The Reeves gift also included paintings by Mrs. Reeves, who
signed with her maiden name, Louise Herreshoff.

Defending champ W&L hosts Wasps

by Andy Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s foot-
ball team kicks off its 1982
season Saturday afternoon at
Wilson Field against Emory &
Henry College.

Coach Gary Fallon’s Gener-
als will be defending the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
crown they captured last year
en route to an 8-2 season. W&L
will also be trying to extend a
six game winning streak they
started last year.

Thirty-two lettermen return
from last year’s championship
club including several key per-
formers at the skill positions.
Lost to graduation are Kodak
Division III All-American Mike
Pressler and all-ODAC tight
end Mike Fogarty and safety
Barry Thompson.

Chief among the many superb
players returning is senior
tailback Chris Cavalline.
Cavalline gained 765 yards
rushing last season while earn-
ing ODAC Player of the Year
honors. He was also a valuable
receiver coming out of the
backfield.

Returning to quarterback the
Generals is Al Paradise.
Paradise had an excellent 1981

"season, completing over 50% of
his passes for 1,014 yards and
six touchdowns.

W&L’s second leading ground
gainer last season, Pat
McGuire, also returns to the
backfield. McGuire rushed for
230 yards in 1981.

While Cavalline will probably
be in the main offensive threat,

no defense can hope to stop the
Generals by stopping Cavalline
alone. “‘They’ve got to be
respectful of everyone in our
backfield. We have a four-back
threat,’’ Coach Fallon observ-
ed.

W&L’s fine offensive line
should give the backs plenty of
running room. Anchoring the of-
fensive line are Senior Andy
Foley and junior Glenn
Kirschner.

If the offense stalls, Fallon
can call on his barefooted place-
kicker Bill Devine to put three
points on the board. Devine
kicked seven field goals last
year and has extremely good
range for a Division III kicker.

On defense, tri-captain Ken
Manganiello will be a stalwart
at defensive end, but the
Generals must find replace-
ments for five starters lost to
graduation.

‘“‘That’s an area where we’re
going to have to find answers as
we go along,’ noted Coach
Fallon. ‘‘We got to hope that our
youngsters that are trying to fill
those positions will come
through.”’

-Overall, W&L looks like a
favorite in the ODAC race, but
Coach Fallon remains noncom-
mittal. ‘“‘We can beat all nine
opponents on our schedule if we
stay healthy and get in the right
frame of mind. If we’re not
healthy or not in the right frame
of mind any of our nine op-
ponents could beat us,”’ Fallon
asserted.

Fallon also expects W&L’s op-

ponents to be particularly fired
up when they take on the
Generals. ‘‘We’re not very
popular. People just like to get
after W&L in all sports. It
makes a lot of other teams’
seasons if they can beat us,”’
Fallon pointed out.

This week’s opponent, Emory
& Henry, brings an 0-2 record to
Wilson Field, but if the game
follows the historical pattern, it
should be close. Last year the
Generals needed a goal line
stand to hold off the Wasps for a
24-17 win.

There have been several
other close games in recent
years, and Emory & Henry ac-
tually leads the all-time series
6-5. “We have to warn our kids
that they’re not going to lay
down and die,”’ Fallon stated.

There are three reasons the
1982 Washington and Lee Uni-
versity cross country team
should be successful: Jon,
Angus, and Frank.

Senior captain Jon Kelafant
(Staunton, Va.), junior Angus
McBryde (Charlotte, N.C.), and
sophomore Frank Pittman
(Atlanta, Ga.) led the 1981
Generals to a successful (8-3-0
record) season. Head coach
Dick Miller has every reason to
believe the trio will enable W&L
to improve in 1982.

McBryde led the Generals in
seven of their eight competi-

Trio to lead harriers

tions last fall, including the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Championship meet where he
placed seventh overall to
become the first W&L harrier to
receive All-Conference hohors
(awarded to the top seven
finishers), His time in the 8000-
meter, 5l-runner event was
26:33, 18 seconds behind the
winner.

McBryde also led W&L at the
NCAA Division III East
Regional Qualifying meet by
placing eighth overall in a 72-
man field. His time in that 8000-
meter race was 25:47.1, 27
seconds behind the winner.

Pittman and Kelafant com-
bined with McBryde to form
W&L’s 1-2-3 finishers in nearly
every race last fall. Pittman led
the team in one competition,

placed second in six (including
the ODAC and NCAA events),
and third in one meet. Kelafant
finished second for the team in
one race, third in five runs. Pitt-
man placed 11th overall in the
Conference Championships
(26:57) and 10th in the NCAA
East Regional race (25:58.5).
Kelafant was 19th in the ODAC
meet (27:53) and 33rd in the
NCAA event (27:04.3).

Two other 1981 lettermen will
return this fall: Paul Chapman
(Short Hills, N.J.) and
sophomore Ben Lipscomb
(Greenville, S.C.), who each
provided team points during the
1981 campaign.

The Generals open their cam-
paign against Mary Washington
and Washington College on
Sept. 25.

Water polo opens with goalie problems

If goalkeeping is the most im-
portant aspect of water polo,
then the Washington and Lee
squad may well have some pro-
blems when they open their
season with the W&L Fall
Classic this weekend.

Andy Gates, last year’s start-
ing goalie, did not return to
school this fall. And junior
Kevin Kadesky, Gates’ backup,
has a swollen spleen and is
questionable for this weekend’s
action in Cy Twombly pool.

Who does that leave? Well,
according to head coach Page
Remillard, if Kadesky is unable
to play, freshman Charles Poer
will handle the duties in the
shallow end, and swimmer Jeff
Gee will tend goal in the deep
end. Should anything happen to
either of them, W&L has three
additional freshmen who can

play the position.

Lefthanded senior Ken John-
stone, who scored the crucial
goals last year in the Generals’
Southern League tournament
victory over the University of
Richmond, is president of his
fraternity and will not play
water polo.

However, junior Matt Raven-
craft, also a lefty, attended the
National Junior Development
Camp in Colorado Springs with
sophomore Bobby Pearson over
the summer and qualified for
the Junior Development team,
which faced teams from other
countries.

He figures to challenge
seniors Bob Marshall and Keith
Kadesky and Pearson for the
two open starting berths.

year’s 31-5 squad are senior

W&L Soccer to begin
‘excellent’ schedule

by Will Kidwell

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team will open an ‘“‘ex-
cellent” schedule on September
21 at Eastern Mennonite. The
team will have a strong return-
ing group of upperclassmen as
well as some very promising
freshman talent.

The upperclassmen who have
returned this year appear to
have worked harder this sum-
mer than in the past. A grueling
summer fitness program has
them in fine physical condition
as they approach the season.
Furthermore, there seems to be
more intelligent off the ball
movement this year than in the
past, according to Piranian.

So far there have been no ma-
jor injuries in preseason prac-
tices and all the players on the
team are expected to be fit for
the season opener against
Eastern Mennonite. However,
there is a possibility that in-
juries later in the year could
cause a problem, particularly
in the defense.

It is possible that there will be
a lot of substituting in the mid-
field and forward positions,
however.

Piranian says that there has
been more emphasis placed on
offense this year than in the

 

first six games, five will be
played on the road. However,
all of the teams played can, in
the opinion of Piranian, be
beaten by the Generals if they
make a concerted team effort.

Overall, Piranian has termed
the schedule to be ‘‘excellent,
challenging, andrealistic.” __

For now, Piranian is looking
only at the Eastern Mennonite
game. He says that all of the
teams the Generals will face
are worthy and a challenge.
However, as in the past, the
team will worry only about the
next game on the schedule and
not make any plans or predic-
tions beyond that.

However, with a strong core
of returning players, the pro-
mising freshmen, the overall
cohesiveness of the team, and
the improved schedule, Pira-
nian is optimistic about the up-
coming season.

Erik Peterson, who scored a
school-record 152 goals, and
juniors Rand McClain (49
assists, 40 goals), Tim Rock (42
goals) and Don Smith (20 goals,
30 assists).

Peterson and McClain were
named to the Division III all-
American team by the US.
Water Polo Coaches Associa-
tion, and they joined Raven-
craft on the silver-medal South
squad at the National Sports

Festival in Indianapolis over
the summer. That squad,
coached by Remillard, had
never before even won a game
at the Sports Festival.

Also, Smith participated in
the Outdoor National Cham-
pionships at Stanford Universi-

ty.

Remillard believes that these
players will ‘‘benefit from their

Generally Speaking
°82 Generals feature offense

by G. Bruce Potter

Washington and Lee football
coach Gary Fallon’s nickname
is “Falcon,” but his club this
season will more likely resem-
ble the San Diego Chargers of
the NF'L with a prolific offense
and a relatively weak defense.

The Generals lost six all-
ODAC performers from last
year’s 8-2 squad, but they
should more than make up for it
with an offense featuring the
passing of junior Al Paradise,
the running of senior Chris
Cavalline (as well as Paradise),
and the receiving of seniors Phil
Hrabar and Steve Corbeille.

All of that experience and
talent (not to mention an offen-
sive line featuring all-ODAC
performers Andy Foley and
Glenn Kirschner ) should lead to
some exciting and explosive
football this season on Wilson
Field.

This was evident in last Satur-
day’s controlled scrimmage on
Wilson Field. At one point,
starting on the three-yard line
on each play, the offense was
able to score five consecutive
times against a defense that
last year had thrown up several
crucial goal-line stands.

First, Cavalline scored twice,
once on a pitchout and once ona
handoff — both to the left. Then,

Paradise rolled out to his left,
and, not finding anyone open,
scooted into the end zone.
Senior tailback Pat McGuire
made an incredible catch for a
score, and finally, sophomore
fullback Danny Jayne burst up
the middle for a touchdown.

Corbeille, a three-year letter-
man, looked particularly im-
pressive as he used his small
size — 5-4, 142 pounds — to get
open and make some impres-
sive catches.

Freshman tailback Chris
Bleggi showed a considerable
amount of potential as he ripped
off a 49-yard touchdown dash.

But the major problems seem
to be on defense and especially
in the secondary. There was a
lot of defensive confusion in the
scrimmage as players were

The W&L Fall Classic will
open with a game between the
Generals and Johns Hopkins at
7:00 p.m. Friday. Other teams
participating in the round-robin
tournament will be Kenyon Col-
lege, Monmouth College, United
States Naval Academy, and
defending champion Slippery
Rock State College.

shuttled back and forth on near-
ly every play as the coaches
tried to find a successful com-
bination.

The defensive line appears to
be fairly solid with seniors Ken
Manganiello and Mark Yerke at
the ends and Bill Dederick,
Marty Manasco, and Doug
Teague on the inside. .

The kicking game is strong
with senior Bill Devine as the
barefooted place kicker and
Cavalline and McGuire sharing
the punting duties, although
McGuire did have a punt block-
ed in Saturday’s scrimmage.

Overall, the Generals will be
looking to improve on last
year’s ODAC championship,
and they have the personnel to
do it, especially since the of-
fense has the potential to score
every time it touches the ball.
