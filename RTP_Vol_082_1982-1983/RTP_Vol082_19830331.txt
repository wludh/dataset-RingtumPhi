Reagan as Propagandist

By ALLEN ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

The growth and sophistica-
tion of communications
technology has made the use
and misuse of propaganda a
crucial element of statecraft.

O.W. “‘Tom’’ Riegel, former
head of the Washington and Lee
Journalism Department for 34
years and an_ international
authority on propaganda, told
the Ring-tum Phi in an inter-
view Tuesday that ‘‘the Reagan
administration’s confronta-
tional Soviet policy could easily
involve us in the consequences
of an overt aggressive act.”

President Reagan, reassured
by charts and declassified in-
telligence photos, presented to
the nation last week an ominous
picture of a growing Soviet
threat to our national security.
This perceived communist
menace always looms larger
before the American public just
as the latest defense budget
figures come under congres-
sional scrutiny; but the Presi-
dent went on to describe an ex-
otic space-based laser and par-
ticle beam weapon that he says
would knock out incoming
Soviet ballistic missiles.

Even as administration of-
ficials defended claims that the

research program would
violate the 1972 antiballistic
missile treaty and the 1967
Outer Space Treaty, many
scientists publicly doubted the
feasibility of Reagan’s pro-
posal. Dr. Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, a Stanford Universi-
ty physicist, told the New York
Times “the practitioners in the
field are not anywhere near as
gung-ho as the President’s
speech implies.’’

Even if the beam weapon
satellites could become opera-
tional, their use would upset the
delicate premise of the 1972
ABM treaty ——=« without the

Philadelphia

Bartini leaves W&L

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Michael Bartini, who until
Tuesday was Washington and
Lee’s Director of Student
Financial Aid, tomorrow begins
a new career in the financial aid
division of the College Board’s
Philadelphia regional office.

Bartini said that while it will
be an “‘exciting new change,”
he’ll miss W&L’s students
“tremendously.”

“The years at W&L have been
a pleasant experience,” he said
in an interview on his last day at
the office. “It’s been fun work-
ing with a well-established in-
stitution that has a deep com-
mitment to education and see-
ing students benefit directly
from it.”

Van Pate, the Associate
Director of Admissions, will be
the interim financial aid direc-
tor until Bartini’s replacement
is named.

“‘We’re hopeful we’ll have
someone in place by the end of
June,” Pate said.

The new director is being
chosen by a committee, with
final approval coming from
President Wilson’s office. Bar-
tini said his successor will
report to Admissions Director
William Hartog.

“‘T think (Bartini) has done an
excellent job,’’ Pate said. “I
think he’s been an excellent
financial aid director and we’re
going to miss him a lot.”’

Pate will continue many of his
admissions office duties at the
same time he moves over to
financial aid. ‘‘Basically I’ll be
working full-time here and full-
time there,” he said.

Before changing to admis-
sions, Pate was W&L’s financial

aid director for six years. He
said he made the switch
‘because the opportunity
presented itself.”

He continued, ‘“‘They both
have their gratifications and
their areas that are not so plea-
sant. It’s hard to say ‘no’ to
anyone.”

Spring is the slowest season of
the year for the admissions of-
fice, according to Pate, but
that’s not the case with finan-
cial aid.

“Spring’s going to be fairly
busy up there,”’ he said. ‘“‘Most
of the decisions have been made
about next year’s freshmen, but
decisions regarding returning
students are still very much in
the mill.”

Michael Bartini

Bartini has been with W&L
for four years. ‘‘My pattern for
an occupation is three to five
years.

“It makes a better ad-
ministrator out of me to know
that I’m always growing in-
stead of getting too settled in
what I’m doing.

‘Although I haven’t outgrown
W&L, the opportunity for me to
leave is too attractive not to
take,”’ Bartini said.

FD profit was *6,400 but...

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi News Editor

In sharp contrast to last
year’s Fancy Dress Weekend
which lost an estimated $20,000,
this year’s event cost $14,424
less than had been budgeted,
according to SAB Fancy Dress
director John Haywood.

Included in this figure, is the
$8,000 that the Executive Com-
mittee earmarked for FD dur-
ing the SAB’s budget hearing in
October. According to Hay-
wood, the $6,400 profit was a
result of lower decorating costs
and increased sales of FD-
related items.

When we made up the early
budgets, we thought we could do
it cheaper but we weren't
sure,’ Haywood said. Last
year’s debacle depleted the stu-
dent body’s emergency funds,
which placed more pressure on
this year’s SAB to be fiscally
responsible.

“If we had lost money, we
would have had to go to Main
Street to borrow it,” Haywood
said.

Monday night, the SAB
returned $5,000 to the EC as par-
tial payment for the additional
funds the EC gave them last
year.

Co-chairman in charge of
films and Fancy Dress Len
Howard attributed the windfall
to luck and extreme caution.

‘Last year’s debacle was too
much of a good example. Now
we've hit both extremes,”
Howard said.

Howard said that he felt that
more money should have been
returned. He was glad to see,
however, that the event was
“entirely participant-funded.”’

Both Howard and Haywood
anticipate the price of an FD
ticket being lowered next year.

“In three years, we’ll be back

Commentary

Terror in the
Top Drawer

Dear General Lee:

Holy Week is upon us. The
promise of the Resurrection is
near. For all that, a mood of dis-
quiet grips the land. It is not
violent, acute, and curable. It is
low-level, chronic, and so far
has resisted the ministrations of
sensible men. A never-ending
din of voices is now the
background muzak of our
public lives, all crying peace.
Egregious references to our
new weapons are all over the
place. God knows these engines
of mass destruction are grim,
but this peace-at-any-price
mood is grimmer far.

An individual here at your old
college had occasion to refer to
another gentleman as an
“‘unregenerate fascist.’’ He
claims to have meant it literal-
ly. As best I can tell, the
gentleman’s only crime is to
have served his country in the
profession of arms.

The latest bulletin from the
church which now bears your
name refers, apparently as a
matter of habit, to the nuclear
horror. Yet we’re one of the sen-
sible crowds. The drivel that, as
a pastoral letter, seeped out of
General Convention last year
was incredible. The United
States is anathema in every
self-respecting pulpit.
Sometimes I feel we’re at our
best decrying injustice when we
are most actively facilitating it.

Our most notable modern
tyrants have had things their
own way for about a generation
now. Predictably, this has im-
proved neither their manners
nor their morals. Yet people,
ostensibly sane, persist in ac-
ting as apologists, recruiters,
lackeys, evangelists for them.
We remain not wholly
defenseless. But their labor is in
vain who keep the city if the will
to fight is absent. As matters
now stand, I imagine we would
fall to a determined assault of

Girl Scouts. (By the way: would
anyone up there be interested in
taking about a gross of cookies
off my hands? My GPA needed
a boost, and the faculty crowd
seems to run heavily to
daughters. )

Another professor is doing his
part to save the country. Dr.
Colvin has presented for his
class and Pi Sigma Alpha has
hosted receptions for a clutch of
guest lecturers. Of late these
have mainly been general of-
ficers of the services. Their
message, labeled casually as
fascist, has been clear,
reasonable and ignored by all
but the few. “Prepare,” they
say. “It’s better to have
defenses and not need them
than to need them and not have
them.’’ Usually, no one even
wakes up. When they do, it is to
damn, vilify, excoriate and
loathe the speaker and the
message. Everyone and his dog
is in on the act. Towns declare
themselves ‘‘nuclear free
zones,” an _ influential car-
toonist, by no means unique,
elides the distinction between
deterrent (defense) and the
“threat of aggression:’’ movie
stars and rockers parade for
“‘peace”’ (on whose terms is not
clear) — it’s a case of chatter,
chatter everywhere and not a
drop of ‘‘think.’’

I write to you because, well,
you fought for our land, whose
motto was ‘‘Deo vindice,’’ God
will vindicate. Could you and
President Davis and anyone
else with influence in the
celestial realm beg God to
hurry? We’re sinking fast. But I
guess what worries me most is
the thought that this lunacy is
most firmly entrenched in the
“‘educated’’ classes. If this is
the result of education, you
wasted a good five years
here...and I’ve wasted three.

Yr. obt. and humble,
Markham Shaw Pyle

EC officers elected

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

Next year’s junior class will
have the greatest amount of ex-
perience on the Executive Com-
mittee as it elected the only two
members with prior EC ex-
perience.

Sophomore representative
Darby Brower was re-elected
and former freshman represen-
tative Cole Dawson edged out
Sam Dalton for the other junior
class position.

The Class of 1986 elected Ken
Lindeman and James White in
Thursday’s run-off. The two

defeated Gerald Shephard, and
Steve Connett who was running
for re-election.

Jim Messer and George
Youmans were elected senior
class representatives. They
defeated Jack O’Brien and
Todd Barstow in the run-off and
will replace Scott Mason and
Ted McQuiston, neither of
whom ran for re-election.

None of next year’s Big Three
has EC experience, either. Bob
Jenevein was elected president,
Dave Judge vice president and
Len Howard secretary in last
month’s elections.

again,’’ Howard predicted.

The extra money will not go to
waste, though. The SAB plans to
buy new projection equipment
for its film series and new lights
for the Cockpit. Most of the
money will probably be spent on
two big weekends this spring.
Although the details are still be-
ing worked out, one might in-
clude a joint venture with VMI.

Haywood commented on the
profit, ‘‘The hardest thing we

Propaganda

(continued from page 1)

technology to defend against a
full-scale nuclear attack, both
_ the Soviet Union and the United
States are deterred by the pro-
spect of mutual assured
destruction.

Kremlin leader Yuri V. An-
dropov characterized Reagan’s
proposal as ‘‘a bid to disarm the
Soviet Union” that ‘‘would ac-
tually open the floodgates to a
runaway race of all types of
strategic arms, both offensive
and defensive.” The chilling
fact is that Andropov’s ap-
prehension is echoed by many
of America’s experts.

One of these is Tom Riegel,
who worked for the U.S. Office
of War Information and the
State Department after a long
career as a journalist.

Riegel, 80 years old and
speaking from his retirement
home in Glasgow; feels the
President, rather than working
toward productive detente, ‘is
trying to increase tension bet-
ween us and our supposed
enemies.”’ Reagan’s anti-Soviet
fervor ‘‘almost boggles the
mind,” said Riegel, citing the
President’s recent speech in
Orlando, Fla., where he called
for Americans to counter ‘“‘the
aggressive impulses of an evil
empire.” Reagan painted a
“‘red’’ picture of Central
America, prophesizing that El
Salvador ‘will join Cuba and
Nicaragua as a _ base for
spreading fresh violence to
Guatemala, Honduras, Costa
Rica,’ and elsewhere in the
American hemisphere of in-
fluence. As a _ conscious,
systematic effort to change or
reinforce people’s attitudes,
these and other statements by
the Reagan administration fit
Riegel’s definition of propagan-
da. Robert Scheer, national
reporter for the Los Angeles
Times, asked Ronald Reagan
during his campaign for the
Presidency;’ ‘‘Are you going to
get us into a nuclear war?”
Reagan answered: “I’ve known
four wars in my lifetime... but
no, I don’t want it, but what I

have seen in all of those wars is
that we have gone into those
wars, backed our way into
them, through weakness. I have
never seen us get into one
through strength.”

These examples join a $239

’ billion defense budget to reflect

the administration’s philosophy
that being prepared to wage a
nuclear war with the intent of
‘“‘winning’’ will prevent a
holocaust. ‘‘History absolutely
contradicts this belief,’’ Riegel
said. Just as America has
bolstered its military might,
Riegel notes ‘“‘we’ve become
less secure than we've ever
been.” The author of a classic
book, Mobilizing for Chaos: The
Story of the New Propaganda,
Riegel has seen successive ad-
ministrations ‘‘base policy on
hostile and disturbing assump-
tions.’’ He describes Reagan as
“more brazen than any past
president,” referring to the
president’s statements that the
House reduction of his proposed
1984 defense budget is ‘‘a dag-
ger straight at the heart”’ of na-
tional security; that an arms
freeze is ‘“‘a very dangerous
fraud’’; and rhetorical implica-
tions that citizens’ activism
toward disarmament is
motivated by communist sen-
timents. :
“Reagan is the most
energetic propagandist we have
today,” Riegel said; and he
engages the media, often unsuc-
cessfully, to promulgate a na-
tional terror of an imminent
Soviet threat. But as the ad-
ministration generates a
mirage of America’s
vulnerability, Riegel said “‘the
Soviet Union has every reason
to be very frightened, possibly
more frightened than we are.”’
Riegel referred to the negative
response of one of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff when asked if he
would exchange our military
for that of the Soviets. This ad-
mission contrasts sharply, and
predictably, with the official
pronouncements.
Military strength figures are
selected and presented out of
context, Riegel said, to obscure

 

 

In Memoriam: Lewis Kerr Johnson

Lewis Kerr Johnson, 78,
emeritus professor of ad-
ministration at Washington and
Lee University where he taught
for 40 years before his retire-
ment in 1973, died Saturday in a
Roanoke hospital following a
brief illness.

A graveside service will take
place at 11 a.m. Tuesday in the
Stonewall Jackson Cemetery’ in
Lexington. Dr. Louis W.
Hodges, professor of religion at
W&L, will officiate.

Johnson is survived by his
wife, Margaret Lupton Johnson
of Lexington; a daughter, Mrs.
Martha Kerr Harris of Athens,
Ga.; a sister, Miss Copeland
Johnson of Waynesboro; and,
two grandchildren. —

He was born August 4, 1904, in
Staunton and received his
bachelor’s and _ master’s
degrees from the University of
Virginia. He earned his Ph.D. in
business organization from
Ohio State University.

Johnson taught economics for
five years at Mercer University
before joining the W&L faculty
in 1933.

At Washington and Lee he
served as head of the commerce
department from 1950 until
1968.

 

He was nationally known in
the fields of marketing and per-
sonnel. His publications includ-
ed a major textbook, ‘‘Sales and

Marketing Management,”’
published in 1957. He research-
ed and wrote ‘Marketing in
Virginia,” published in 1950 by
the Advisory Council on the
Virginia Economy.

One of the most respected
members of the Washington

and Lee faculty, Johnson had
been honored since his retire-
ment by the establishment of
two scholarship funds and an

endowed professorship. The
L.K. Johnson Scholarship was
created in 1974 by more than 200
of Johnson’s friends and former

students. In 1979 Robert G.
Brown, a W&L alumnus from

the advantages we have and
highlight the margins the
Soviets have gained. While con-
ceding that many nations prac-
tice these techniques, Riegel
warned that the Reagan ad-
ministration’s unprecedented
secrecy measures “reinforce

the need for skepticism. It is the
height of folly to accept un-
proven assertions as fact.”
There is a “patriotic reflex of
agreement and response to this
fraudulent mask of crisis,”
Riegel said. ‘This is the deeply-
ingrained habit of tribe loyal-
ty,” Riegel explained, ‘“‘that
with huge populations and hor-
rendous weapons comes a
tremendous danger, a
monster.” Riegel believes the
only defense against this blind
consent is public scepticism. A
readiness to accept American

Bartini bolts to Phill

(continued from page 1) ;

Spring is the slowest season of
the year for the admissions of-
fice, according to Pate, but
that’s not the case with finan-
cial aid.

“Spring’s going to be fairly
busy up there,’’ he said. ‘‘Most
of the decisions have been made
about next year’s freshmen, but
decisions regarding returning
students are still very much in
the mill.”’

Bartini has been with W&L
for four years. ‘‘My pattern for
an occupation is three to five
years.

“It makes a better ad-
ministrator out of me to know
that I’m always growing in-
stead of getting too settled in

what I’m doing.

‘Although I haven’t outgrown
W&L, tbe opportunity for me to
leave is too attractive not to
take,’’ Bartini said.

Bartini worked all day Tues-
day, and begins in Philadelphia
Friday, April 1. There’s such a
short time between the two, he
says, ‘because my choice was
to stay at W&L as long as I
could.”’

He laughed when asked what
it would be like to begin a
career on April Fool’s Day. “‘I
made sure I had my contract
signed before I asked them if
they were kidding,” he said.

“It’s sort of become an infor-
mal office joke up tbere.”’

Bartini said he’s enjoyed his

tenure here. ‘I’ve grown
tremendously as an admin-
istrator, at least I think I have.

“T wouldn’t have been able to
do that if it weren’t for the in-
stitution’s support,”’ he said.

“It’s been a’ pleasure to work
with the students here. Students
around here are pretty much
gentlemen. The academic en-
vironment is such that you don’t
have rabble-rousers.

“Students are concerned with
the institution and its environ-
ment, so property and people
are treated with respect and
they’re supportive of each
other.”

As to whether the recent cut
in federal aid to students has
hurt W&L, Bartini said, “I

perceptions of a Soviet threat
are mirrored in the eyes of the
Russians. After all, Riegel
recalled, we were the first to
use nuclear weapons and prac-
tice the encirclement strategy
for which the Soviets are
maligned. :
Riegel was serving as
cultural attache in the
American Legation at
Budapest, Hungary when we
dropped the first atomic bomb.
He saw a Russian officer fall to
tears after reading a newspaper
account of Hiroshima’s destruc-
tion. When Riegel asked why
one of our allies would be so af-
fected, the Russian said, ‘““My
country is finished. This is go-
ing to be the end of us.”
Althoughthe officer was then
ready to submit to an enduring
American domination, Riegel

suspect not.

“The Reagan Administration
cuts lost a lot of wind compared
to his original proposals,’ he
said. ‘That was done through a
lot of lobbying by ad-
ministrators, students, and
other financial aid and college
personnel.”’

“One of the things that I think
has helped is the reduction in
the interest rate.

“The future of financial aid
on the federal scene,’’ Bartini
said, ‘‘is to maintain the present
level. We’re going to have a
drop in students and we’ll
always have an inflation rate.

‘But the goal must be to stay
constant with dollars and use
them in the most efficient way
possible.”’

explains, his government chose
to resists— ‘‘So you see, there
wasn’t a Pax Americana.”’

Riegel sees this feeling of |
helplessness overwhelming
Americans in the 1980s. His
solution is a renunciation of the
automatic patriotic reflex that
is instilled in our citizens from
infancy. Riegel said we must be
able to recognize that perhaps a
leader ‘‘doesn’t know as much
as we do.” We must ask
ourselves, Riegel advised, the
following questions when con-
sidering an administrator’s
statements:

eWhat is his motive? (Surely
someone stands to profit from
an arms race)

e Is he lying?

e What has he not said that he
knows and I should know?

¢ Who is being screwed?

Bartini says his new job will
require similar skills as the one
here. ‘‘It’s not terribly different
from what I’m doing right now
except that I’ll be working for a
new type of nonprofit organiza-
tion.

“I won’t have contact with
students anymore, but I’ll be in
a college environment.”’

After graduating from
Westfield State College, Bartini
got into financial aid work ‘‘by
coincidence.

“IT was working at a bank I
didn’t like,’’ he said when he
was offered a financial aid posi-
tion with Simon’s Rock College
in Massachusetts, where he
stayed three years before com-
ing to Lexington.

Survey team finds

two prehistoric sites

An archaeological survey
team from Washington and Lee
University uncovered two
prehistoric sites on Tinker
Creek in Botetourt County while
conducting a contract survey in
that area earlier this month.

According to James T.
Adams Jr., survey ar-
chaeologist at W&L, the two
sites are in close proximity in
the vicinity of Tinker Mill. Both
are small, transient campsites
from the archaic and possibly
the woodland periods, Adams
said.

“‘These sites are fairly com-
mon throughout the uplands,”
noted Adams. ‘During the
course of our field recon-
naissance and _ sub-surface
testing, we uncovered several
projectile points and waste
flakes. The sites associated
with this type of material are in-
dicative of short-term occupa-
tion by small groups of
hunters.”

The W&L team directed by
John McDaniel, associate pro-
fessor of anthropology at W&L,
was contracted by an engineer-
ing firm to conduct a Phase I
surveyof a 109,000-foot drainage
basin in preparation for a pro-

posed gravity sewer line to be

built in the area.

“We are still in the process of
quantifying and evaluating the
artifacts before we submit a

This is the third such survey
that Washington and Lee has
been selected to conduct during
this academic year. The selec-
tion is based on competitive bid-
ding with survey teams from
other academic and research
institutions. Earlier, W&L
teams surveyed sites in
Pearisburg and Hot Springs.

In addition to McDaniel and
Adams, the W&L survey team

was composed of four
Washington and _ Lee
undergraduates -- senior

Michael Gregory of Richmond,
sophomore John Delany of Lex-
ington, sophomore Randall Ray
of Wake Forest, N.C., and
freshman Ted Goebel of
Coolville, Ohio.

Another member of the
survey team was Dr. Alan
Sullivan, an archaeologist from
Arizona. McDaniel explained
that Sullivan was asked to par-
ticipate in the project ‘‘because
we knew his experience in the
Southwest would be very
helpful tq us. His involvement
was wonderful for our students
who had the opportunity to
discuss variations in techniques
and strategies with him.”

Adams noted that the
students who participated in the
project all had previous ex-
perience in such surveys.

“The real value of conducting
a survey such as this one is that -
it presents the students with an
opportunity for practical ap-
plication of the techniques they
have learned in the classroom,”’
said Adams.

Since 1977, Washington and
Lee has been awarded 15 con-
tracts to conduct surveys, vary-
ing from the preliminary Phase
I variety to the more com-
prehensive Phase II and Phase
III surveys.

A Journal of Interdisciplinary Thought

 

Opening a Dialogue on Honor

By CHRIS BOUQUET

The Executive Committee and
the Honor Code: Can We Talk
About It?

“Do not merely confound in
yourselves the legislative and
executive powers, take also the
judicial power, and then call
yourselves by your correct
name; the Terror.”

—Lamartine in the consti-
tuent assembly of the second
Republic of France.'

Notwithstanding the fact that
our executive committee “‘con-
founds” the legislative, ex-
ecutive, and judicial powers of
student government at W&L, I
do not wish to imply by the
above quote that I feel the Ex-
ecutive Committee constitutes

a “Terror” akin to the one
shown in the French Revolu-
tion. Rather, I offer the quote as
a tongue-in-cheek introduction
to this editorial, which is about
the Executive Committee and
the Honor Code. I want to bring
up questions of the fairness of
the system, without appearing
like a campus pariah. So often,
when someone brings up
criticisms of the system, as Mr.
Berghel did some time ago in
the Phi, he is immediately
labeled as suspect, dishonor-
able, or some kind of jerk with
no right to his own opinion.
Albeit,-Mr. Berghel’s criticism
was highly impolitic and he
deserved some abuse for the
abuse he offered. However, it is
legitimate for a student who

pays tuition to ask questions
about the system he lives under.

Mr. Vlahoplus pointed out in
the first edition of the Excelsior
that the honor code must brook
no question of degree. Lying is
lying, cheating is cheating and
stealing is stealing, no matter
how trivial. He would apply the
honor code to the Bic pens that
we see lying on various tables
and desks around campus.
Now, if I pick up someone else’s
pen and use it, I am guilty of an
honor offense under this defini-
tion. Therefore, the only
available penalty, that of expul-
sion, will be meted out on me. If
I am a senior, I lose the money
invested in my education (over
$20,000) plus the opportunity
lost of not having a degree. A

fine of $20,000 or more for steal-
ing a pen is unfair by anyone’s
standards. Isn’t due process of
law denied in the imposition of
such a penalty. Under ques-
tionable procedures? A group of
18-21 year olds has meted out
this earth-shaking penalty.
They bar me from classes until
I am proven innocent. They
serve as judge, jury and pro-
secutor. They impose ‘cruel
and unusual!” punishment.

Will the EC still find me guilty

’ if I pick up someone else’s pen,

thinking it is my own? Will the
EC believe me when I say I
thought it was my pen? If I
make an unknowing inadver-
tent mis-statement am I guilty
of a lie? Will the Executive

W&L Honor System Needs Critical Review

By TOM CONNORS

The Honor System, it is
unarguable, provides the W&L
community with immense bene-
fits. These benefits, from
unlocked buildings and self-
scheduled exams to our ‘‘com-
munity of trust,” are well
known to all who go here. To
abolish the Honor System would
be an unfortunate break with
the past with even more unfor-
tunate results. Yet to place the
Honor System on the level of the
Bible and above the Constitu-
tion as unalterable and infalli-
ble would show more emotional

bias than reason. As we are an
intellectual institution, ques-
tioning and rational argument
exist as a fundamental part of
our nature. It is with these ideas
in mind, with careful respect
and a historian’s awe for age,
that I approach the Honor
System.

The Honor System has its
origins in the presidency of
Robert E. Lee. While it is not
quite from Mount Sinai then, it
is ‘‘a damn close thing.”’ This is
precisely as it should be;
among XIXth Century Ameri-
cans, a more _ stainless
character is difficult to find.
Lee’s administration defined
the Honor System loosely:

The discipline has been placed
upon that basis on which it is
believed experience has shown it
can be most safely trusted — upon
the honor and self-respect of the
students themselves.

We have hardened the quote
into three ‘don'ts’: Lying,
Cheating and Stealing. The
definition is succinct, simple,
and effective. Following these
guidelines, a man should find it
difficult to cross the bounds of
honor. Yet it is hardly impossi-
ble and certainly quite im-
aginable for a man to become
dishonorable while remaining
in the bounds of the Honor
System. Likewise, Truth is bet-

ter withheld by a gentleman on
rare occasions. For instance, I
don’t find a doctor dishonorable
because he fails to inform a
mother in critical condition of
her baby’s demise. This is an
extreme example, but less
dramatic occasions are not un-
common. Thus truth must be
used by a gentleman with
discretion; the key factor is the
unselfishly, sincerely, and
thoughtfully derived considera-
tion of the other’s well-being.
Thus, in terms of the strictly
defined system, Honor escapes
and is relative. For this reason,
we have need for a court set-up
to unbiasedly determine the
often fine line between the
selfless gentleman and the self-
justified, self-concerned liar.

Committee believe me when I
say that I did not intend those
remarks, or believed them to be
true? I wish I could answer
these questions with some
assurance that the EC would be
fair. Yet, when I think of the
possibility of an honor trial
about a 29* Bic pen, and no EC
member can deny this possibili-
ty, given the views expressed
by Mr. Vlahoplus, I wonder
about the fairness of our
system. Can we talk about it?

'T.Vile, MJC, ‘‘Constitu-
tionalism and the Separation of
Poters” (Oxford, Clarendon
Press, 1969,) p.208.

The main physical problem
with the present set-up is the
lack of a prosecution at the EC
trial. The EC acts as jury as
well as being expected to in-
vestigate the violation and call
and question witnesses. The dif-
ficulty is not, then, ina lack of a
prosecution, but in the semantic
neverneverland which claims
there is. I have no wish to ques-
tion or defame the motives of
the EC, of which I have neither
insight nor information. How-
ever, a_ rational conclusion
drawn from this system is that
they who have investigated and
played Devil’s Advocate pro-
bably have formed unconscious
biases on the situation. Again,
this is not malice on their part,

Honor

(continued from page 5)
but simply the inevitable devel-
opment of spending time study-
ing a situation. Indeed, to argue
otherwise would be insulting,
that is, that the EC do not use
their minds. The problem lies
not in the EC’s thinking, but
rather in their judging. Since
they are so well informed and
versed in the system, they are
invaluable for the purpose of in-
vestigation and _prosectuion.
Likewise, the president or some
other officer should make an ex-
cellent judge, acting as unbias-
ed mediator and self-restrained
advisor to the jury on the
technicalities of the Honor
Code. By having a randomly
selected jury, we would avoid
both the natural bias of a. pro-
secution as well as the com-
plicated political structure of a
group as closely-knit as the EC.

Deeper, more theoretical
questions arise also. The uni-
versity is a place to grow, to
learn, and to change —physical-
lly, intellectually, and spiritual-
ly, This is our ideal. Certainly
many graduates, I hope, look
back on their freshman year
and discover that the person
who started here was radically
different from the one who
graduated. Maturation is a pro-
cess of change and develop-
ment. Our intellectual and
social community, we hope,
promotes this. One enters a boy
and leaves a man.

Change is frightening though.
Man’s fear of the unknown is
deep-rooted. To change is to
venture onto untrodden paths.
We hold back, hanging onto our
flawed defenses as well as our
strengths. I think we can argue
that an honor violation is the
result of a character flaw. At
W&L, such a flaw is deemed an
extremely important one, as in-
deed it is. Yet when we find
such a flaw, our reaction is to
wash our hands of the in-

dividual entirely. It is a Botany.

Bay system; instead of
attempting to exorcise the stu-
dent’s demon, we tell him to
take his demon and go. What
happens to him is not our con-
cern. He had his chance, and he
blew it. Our concern then is with
the system and its principles.
This is, in the words of the great
English historian A.J.P.
Taylor:

‘‘.the most horrible, and
perhaps the most universal, of
human maladies: the belief that
principles and doctrines are
more important than lives.’’

The problem is_ precisely
this. We claim to be a
small, individual-orientated

school, yet we place our prin-
ciples and rules over the in-
dividual. In my mind, our size is
a more important part of our
school than the Honor System.
Instead of using our small size

to concern ourselves with en-
couraging and promoting
positive growth in the flawed in-
dividual, we purge him and
throw him out. The community
is all-important; it provides
identity and security. Man can-
not exist without it. The great
and theoretical institution goes
on; the individual, well, we
claim no responsibility for him.

An older tradition and tie our
school has, is with Christianity.
Albeit, we are now a secular
school, but no need exists to
purge the school of all its tradi-
tions. We still have a chapel and
a chaplain; certainly the
gentler, basic ideals of Christ
may survive after the loss of
militant codes (such as those
used by the Spanish Inquisi-
tion. )

I have so far made a plea for
mercy, yet I do realize blanket
mercy must destroy the Honor
System and its benefits. Thus
we must temper mercy with
justice. When it is argued that a
weighing of dishonorable acts
will destroy the “‘community of
honor” that exists, we fail to
take into proper perspective the
effects of expulsion on the in-
dividual’s life. Theoretically, a
student may be thrown out for
taking a Kleenex without ask-
ing. Yet we realize that this is a
ridicuous conclusion. We
recognize that honor lies
somewhere deeper than the
simplicity of the Honor Code.

The three defined offenses are
simple and useful, but they
must be tempered with careful
judgment. The punishment may
need to outweight the offense in
order to enact a Pavlovian
change, but it should not have
the effect of seeming too great
for the offense, such as Kafka’s
childhood memory of being put
out in the rain. This produces
anger, resentment, and self-
pity rather than change (as in
Burgess’ or Kubrick’s ‘“‘A
Clockwork Orange’’). Thus
wouldn’t failing every class ina
trimester for cheating produce
the same result, or even a more
positive one than expulsion
does?

The reasons we need to
temper our judgments run even
shallower. The Honor System is
no place for personal vendettas.
I think probably anyone here
could find an example of an
H.V. in the history of a friend’s
actions. But we do not turn
them in, nor do we (necessari-
ly) think them dishonorable.
This is the sense of tempered
justice I think is called for. Iam
not suggesting an investigation
of the accuser. That is un-
necessary, for vindictiveness is
difficult to contain and impossi-
ble to hide; it will show itself.
There exists also a sense of
distaste for the accuser in the
community, which I think is
relatively healthy. The Honor
System is no place for anything

except careful, reasoned, and
well-considered judgment.

We know honor cannot be
measured by rules or codes:
this is why we have a trial
system. We know what honor is
(in Potter Stewart’s phrase: “‘I
know it when I see it...’’), but
we are unable to pinpoint it. To
define honor is to limit the
limitless. For this reason we
need to reflect seriously over
judgments of honor; the conse-
quences are immense: our
abilities are quite lacking in
comparison. Indeed, at our age,
it is rather presumptous to feel
our limited experience enables
us to judge anyone’s honor at
all. We need to approach these
decisions as if we were ap-
proaching God: fearful, inex-
perienced, humble, and unsure
of our abilities. Not to do so is
the greatest insult to the system
of all.

To change the system is not
necessarily to weaken it. As any
insightful historian realizes, to
cling to the past because it is the
past is to stagnate ‘‘ ’Tisn’t ho-
ly...merely old’’). To rush blind-
ly forward is to invite disaster.
To reasonably determine what
is foundation and what is rub-
bish may not preclude
mistakes, but it’s the best we
mortals can do.

Responsible Journalism

BY FRANK JACKMAN

For a vocation more or less
priding itself on independence
the thought of accountability to
anyone or anything is a touchy
subject. On a gut level, account-
ability brings to mind censor-
ship, prior restraint, and a host
of other evils. Further analysis
reveals that, to some extent, the
collective fears of journalists
are justified. But on the other
hand, there is much to be said
for a responsible press and the
advantages it would bring for
everyone involved.

It seems to me that efforts to
‘“‘guarantee’’ responsible press
performances are doomed to
failure from the outset. The
word guarantee has a
regulatory ring to it.
‘“‘Guaranteeing’’ responsible
press performance would seem
to require rules and regulations
to use as methods of fullfilling
the guarantee. Placing restric-
tions on performance to ensure
the guarantee could never be
accepted by journalists, con-
stantly wary of such limita-
tions. Responsible performance
would have to be defined to such
a degree as to possibly inhibit

the freedom of the press to
unacceptable levels.

The value to be placed on
news councils, ombudsmen,
and the like is variable. I would
maintain that such organiza-
tions and institutions are
susceptible to regional pre-
judices and values thus making
them more valuable on a local
level than on the national level.
There is something to be said
for these organizations on a
local or regional level. It seems
that guidelines enacted, if any,
would be easier to enforce or
oversee on a local level basis
simply because smaller units
are easier to handle. Also, local
organizations and institutions
would be more sensitive to local
peculiarities and needs thus
providing a more relevant ser-
vice.

Conversely, local organiza-
tions providing specialized
guidelines may further frag-
ment the trade and ultimately
the public. A spectrum full of
varying versions on _ press
responsibility and performance
could harm the credibility of
journalism more than help it. It
would be analogous to the early

years of this country’s history
when each state or colony had
its own currency leading to
chaos when it came time for in-
terstate commerce.

Then who should have a voice
in determing press responsibili-
ty and performance? Most peo-
ple would discount the gover-
ment for various reasons.
Others would argue that the
public should have a major
voice. While this is true to some
extent one must consider the
nature of our laws. They reflect
the values and prejudices of our
society or the general public.
Too much public voice in the
matter would be tantamount to
inviting the goverment in to
regulate the industry. There is
much to be said for involving
journalism schools in the pro-
cess. But they would have only
limited effect as can be
demonstrated by the ratio of
practicing journalists to those
journalists who attended some
sort of journalism school.

What is needed is a combina-
tion of all these things working
on a national and regional] level.
Support must come from the
academic world as well as the
world of the journalist.

Liberation in the Land

By CHRIS FULTON

The debate over an en-
vironmental ethic has recently
achieved prominence on the
political agenda of the United
States. In the past, use of the en-
vironment was chiefly a ques-
tion of economic feasability. Of
course, more is at stake than
economic value. The welfare of
the environmental area itself,
that is the lives of all plants and
animals on it is affected
adversely by exploitation. The
complex ecological interde-
pendence of the world is
tampered with, a consequence
our children will have to
somehow live with. Also the
aesthetic value of the land itself
and the enjoyment of it by us
and future generations is
forever taken away.

These are the factors which
enter in to decisions about en-
vironmental protection. Econo-
mic and environmental _in-
terests battle for lesser and
greater degrees of protection
and. regulation. But the for-
mulation of a definitive, com-
prehensive national enironmen-

oom New

By NORM BALL

If there is a quote which best
paraphrases the major the-
oretical rift within the French
New Wave film movement of

the late fifties, it might be the.

cry of existentialist despair in
Sartre’s “La Nausee: “We are in

the way.” In his obsession with.

discarding the montage
theories of the Russian film
school, Andre Bazin (the foun-
ding editor of ‘Cahiers du
Cinema”’ and spiritual father of
the “cinema of truth’), en-
couraged the use of ‘‘non-
manipulative’’ film techniques

such as the stationary camera >

and the long scene. This theory,
however, betrays an inadequate
understanding of the nature of
the camera. For far from being
a merely voyeurastic element
of the reality it presents. As
Eisenstein points out, the mere
imposition of the quadrilateral

“lens upon the diffuseness of
nature constitutes a fundamen-
tal conflict — a dialectic — in
which the original subject mat-
ter is inalterably transformed.
Obtrusiveness, in short,
becomes an inevitable legacy of
film.

Perhaps the most articulate
critic/director to emerge from
the New Wave in opposition to
Bazin is the the French director
Jean Luc Godard. A student of
Cartesian philosophy, Godard

tal policy will never occur
under the present regulative
framework. Government policy
will sway toward more or less
regulation, and exhibit regional
idiosyncracies as long as it is
debated in the political arena.
Environmental policy must be
formulated, then put into a legal
framework rather than a
political one.

  

Environmental protection in
the U.S. today is regulatory.
The agent of regulation is the
Enviornmental Protection A-
gency. The EPA is a political
agency. Its policies change with

presidential administrations
and under the pressure of lob-
byists. Thus for better or for
worse, the strictness of regula-
tion enforcement has been less

 

    

under Watt and the Reagan ad-
ministration.

Land — and the life on it — is
viewed as property. Property is
something one exploits for
economic profit whether it be
land, slaves, or widgets.
Regardless of any degree or
strictness of regulation the en-
vironment will be exploited.
Black slaves in the United

States were economically ex-
ploited until they were given
legal rights and were able to
uphold them. How well or
harshly they were treated by
their masters did not matter —
they were being exploited to one
or another degree.

Likewise the environment
should be given legal status.
The environment could take you
or your business to court if you
violated its rights, suing in a
court of law for reparation of
damages. Such a legal frame-
work would be an enormous im-
provement over regulatory
measures decided by the
political battle between econo-
mic utility and environmental
utility. The national parks are
an excellent example of such a
legal framework albeit a strict
“off limits’ one. With land and
space becoming more scarce,
all land should be given some
type of legal status. Constitu-
tional amendments might be a
good idea although it is doubtful
that the rights of the environ- —
ment would be _ inalienable
—they could not override
human rights But at least the
welfare of the environment
would be respected and upheld.

Wave and Godard gee

displays in his films an almost
innate sense of the problems in-
herent in the Cartesian sub-
ject/object model. In his first
film, Breathless A Bout de Souf-
fle ’59), Godard, through the
guise of a gangster movie, ex-
plores some fascinating theo-
retical questions about film. His
major contribution to film
theory, and, in fact his major
preoccupation within
Breathless, is in a recognition of
subjective “mind’s eye,’’ and
the objects as portrayed on the
screen. This he does by turning
the camera upon itself, that is,
the film becomes an object to
itself, or in other words the sub-
ject matter is enlarged to in-
clude the camera itself. In one
scene for instance, the main
character actually ‘“‘converses”’
with the camera as it sits in the
passenger seat of his car. Thus
the camera becomes a charac-
ter in the film. Its role becomes
explicitly participatory.

This phenomenon of self-
referentiality in films is refer-
red to by Christian Metz as dou-
ble mirror construction, or in-
escutcheon construction. In
becoming the object of its own
scrutiny, this kind of film
creates the illusion of limitless
space (en abyme), in which, as
in two mirrors facing each
other, the reflections of both the
exterior film and its interior
counterpart reflect one another
ad infinitum. These films are
among the ‘‘black holes’’ of art,

rich in an apparently limitless
display of metaphor and
allegory.

In self-referential films such
as Breathless, the form (film)
becomes’ largely _in-
distinguishable from the con-
tent (film). This notion cor-
responds to the Jamesian belief
that, artistically form and con-
tent are inseparable. Attempts
to suggest prescribed forms
(e.g. the moral didacticism of
James’ contemporary, William
Dean Howells) destroy or
detotalize the artistic effort. In
such a conceptual scheme, the
critic (i.e. the objective eye)
preceeds the artist (the subjec-
tive eye). With the introduction
of this subject/object schism,
elements of both time and space
invade the work. Immediacy,
immanence, and timelessness
yield to a sense of duration.

Of course, for any work of art
to be successful, it must con-
front, within itself, the problem
of time. In The Republic, for ex-
ample, Plato builds the ideal
state only to systematicly
dismantle it in the latter half of
the dialogue. For Plato, then,
art capitulates to time, but on
its own terms. And yet, such a
work of art acheives at least a
thematic timelessness. This is
because, containing the seeds of
its own demise, its destruction
becomes self-contained, en-
folding within the work itself.
As Wallace Stevens notes in

“The Statue at the World’s
End” “All things destroy
themselves or are destroyed.”’
With destruction the legacy of
existence, self-destruction
becomes an artistic imperative.

In Breathless, the two-bit
gangster Michel, is represen-
tative of a myriad of roles sur-
rounding the film. He is
Belmondo the serious actor
struggling against a B-movie
Bogartesque mold as well as
Belmondo the man struggling to
escape the limitations imposed
upon his identity by Belmondo
the actor. In terms of the plot
there is Michel, the gangster,
running from the police. The
cohesive characteristic of all
these postures is that they are
anarchic, of course, and if there
is an overarching theme to this
multi-layered conflict, it is
man’s struggle against the
limits of his existence.

Yet despite Belmondo’s ef-
forts to escape the film, the
camera relentlessly tracks him
up the street in the final scene,
determined to seal its conclu-
sion with his death. It is clear
though that the B-movie genre
has been seriously damaged as
Michel staggers up the street
with a bullet in his back. Absent
is the time-worn shoot-out scene
or the fiery ambush. Thus, in
transcending the image of ‘‘the
dying gangster,”’ the formulaic
genre is broken, and a heighten-
ed sense of reality enters the
film. Belmondo’s struggle has

been a success in a partial
sense, at least; and in breaking
from its prior expectations im-
plicit in its genre, the film ar-
ranges its own thematic de-
struction.

In a further attempt to dilute
the Cartesian split, Godard in-
tersperses the object with the
subject. The appendages of film
— director, audience, actors,
that is, the subjective reality of
the film — are wed to the objec-
tive reality — the plot, the
characters — to form a greater
sense of unity. In the last few
scenes of the film, Michel’s
girlfriend (played by the late
Jean Seberg) assumes the role
of director, orchestrating the
conclusion of the film by reveal-
ing to the police’ the
whereabouts of the fugitive
Michel.

Similarly, Godard himself ap-
pears in one scene, ‘‘directing”’
a police car to the hotel in which
he saw Michel. In both the
Seberg and the Godard se-
quences, the forces of order
(i.e. the police) are invoked in
the interest of steering the film
to its proper end. In light of this,
there emerges another fun-
damental And equally import-
ant — conflict within the film,
and that is man’s struggle
against the strictures of art. In
the final scene, Michel is more
than a renegade from the Pari-
sian authorities. He is also a

fugitive of the directoral

The Nuclear Issue

By STEVE KEROS

Talk of nuclear war is
something constantly heard
about these days. Many
Americans conjure up visions
of a “Nuclear Button’ in
Washington and the Kremlin
that, if pressed, would quickly
reduce the earth to radioactive
rubble. People hear of the com-
bined capability of the United
States and the Soviet Union to
flatten the globe eight times
over and wonder why we
“must’’ spend hundreds of
billions of dollars to acquire
weapon systems like the MX,
Trident, and B-1 that serve no
apparently productive purpose.
Americans rightfully should
question the titanic expense and
real need for such weapons. But
they must make an objective at-
tempt at trying to understand
the rationale behind the acquisi-
tion of these armaments. A
basic understanding of the pre-
sent balance of forces between
the two superpowers is essen-
tial if the ordinary concerned
citizen is to talk about current
defense expenditures with any
degree of logic and coherence

whatsoever.

Many people wonder whether
there is any intelligence behind
the present buildup of a new
generation of U.S. nuclear
delivery systems. Laymen
often ask ‘‘Why must we con-

Just War

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE

Author’s Note: As an
Anglican, I approach my sub-
ject from within the tradition of
the Church. I do not know of any
other religion having the body
of theory on the issue as does
the Church, but I imagine one
could easily be constructed for
each. For a comparison of the
ethics of the major religions I
direct the reader to C.S. Lewis’
“The Abolition of Man.” I find
him convincing in his proof that
there exists a basic Natural
Law to which all peoples at all
times have at least paid lip-
service; and this natural law I
imagine will yield the same
results in the regard of just war
theory as the dogma of Mother
Church.

The ethical difficulties sur-
rounding the prosecution of war
in a nuclear age I approach with
some trepidation. But the
remarkable amount of non-
sense being talked on the sub-
ject by many who know better
prompts me to make a few
points which appear, in the
parlous state of the discourse,
to have been overlooked. The
confusion is basic. Just war
theory is concerned with pro-
giniting the egregious use of
force. Pacifism renounces the
option of force. Many of the folk
claiming to find nuclear war un-

stantly try to ‘stay ahead’ of the
Russians in something as
ridiculous as an apparently
never-ending arms race, when
we already have so many
nuclear bombs already?’’ This
is a very reasonable question,
but it tends to ignore the many
myriad facets of the raison
d’etre for our nuclear forces.
The idea behind the existence of
American nuclear weapons,
both strategic and theatre/tac-
tical, is one of deterrence. The
object is to deter the other side
from any thought of aggression
by a preponderance or equality
of force on our side. If ‘‘they”’
know that we will not tolerate
threats to what is deemed as
our absolute vital interests, it is

reasoned, then (it is hoped)

peace will be preserved. But
this sort of strategy presumes,
at a minimum, a rough balance
or parity of forces (both
strategic and conventional).
Political ramifications also
play a large part in the deter-
mination of the role and (thus)
requirements of our strategic
posture. Western Europe de-
pends heavily on the USS.

Force de Frappe notwithstand-
ing. Much of the Middle East
and ironically, China and even
Iran (!) depend to a significant

just are in fact opposed to the
use of coercive or defensive
force under any circumstances.

Von Clausewitz calls war ‘‘the
continuation of policy by other
means.’ This has been de-
nounced as a nasty, cynical, im-
moral statement. In fact, it has
a good deal in common with Au-
gustine’s claim in Ep. 189 (ad
Bonifacium) that war, to secure
peace or create a just secular
order, is proper as a last resort
of policy. Montesquieu, I
believe, said the same, and be-
tween Augustine’s time and his,
the statement had been made
regularly. In the world the con-
tinental Congresses of the 1770s
grounded their war against the
English usurper George III
upon such contentions. The
renunciation by Chamberlain
and the Western democracies of
arms as a means of securing the
peace of Europe directly entail-
ed the Holocaust, the agony of
war, and the need felt to aban-
don Eastern Europe to totali-
tarianism after the war as pay-
ment to the Soviets for defen-
ding soil they would have
defended in any case. Churchill
said truly of Neville Chamber-
lain that he had chosen shame
over war; “he has the shame,
and he will have war
nonetheless.’’ The point is that
Mother Church has always

extent on an American nuclear
guarantee of their sovereignty
from Soviet encroachment. The
success of American Foreign
Policy in the Third World de-
pends heavily on the perceived
image of American strength,
militarily as well as morally.
The cohesion of our various
alliances, especially NATO,
depends greatly upon the
resolve of the U.S. to protect her
friends through thick and thin.
The will to use any measure
necessary to preseve our com-
mitments and responsibilities
inevitably requires a strong and
comprehensive military pos-
ture. And finally, in dealing
with the soviets, a reasonable
agreement can only be reached
with them if we negotiate from
a position of strength or equali-

ty. i
To understand the much
discussed theory of ‘‘parity’’ or

refused the pacifist cup because
to fail to resist evil is to abet it.
Pacifism in the face of injustice
is facilitation. Kant, you will
recall, points out that he who
wills the end wills the means.
That is, if the end, however
laudable, necessitates the
unavoidable use of immoral
means, it is wrong to will that
end. Equally, if we damn an
end, we are obligated to in-

terfere with the means of its in--

stitution. To allow injustice
scope for action is as wrong as
to promote injustice deliberate-
ly. (The consequences of this to
“liberation theology” I leave
the reader to consider. )

So pacifism, the renunciation
of force across the board is out
of court. Just war theory, we
have said, is concerned with the
improper use of force. We have
just seen that the end of war
may be so desirable as to make
war a moral obligation. But
does the capacity inherent in to-
day’s engines of mass destruc-
tion constitute a necessarily
wrong substance? Are nuclear
weapons, simply in virtue of
their being nuclear, immoral

strategic balance, one must
begin to understand the present
set-up of our nuclear forces.
The U.S. strategic deterrent is
based on the concept of the
“Triad.” A combination of air,
sea, and land forces are com-
bined into a massive force
hopefully capable of deterring
any attack. Up to now, the
United States has relied on the
idea of Mutual Assured De-
struction (MAD) between the
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to keep
the peace. If either side launch-
ed an attack on the other (first
strike), the side originally at-
tacked would still have enough
power left to deliver a crushing
retaliatory blow. This is why we
have a seemingly excess num-
ber of submarines and bombers
in addition to missiles; if the
Soviets struck at our missiles,
we could still fire back with our
presently invulnerable sub-

under all circumstances?

They are not. Like any other
weapon, they are used im-
morally when they are used by
an aggressor. Just war theory is
clear in prohibiting the use of an
ounce, much less a megaton, of
unnecessary power. But it

allows to the defender sufficient «

means whereby he may defend
himself. Given the official and
semi-official Soviet pro-
nouncements on the subject of
nuclear winnability, the
democracies have no choice but
to adopt a deterrent posture of
sufficient force that, if the worst
comes, they may defend them-
selves. Obviously, if every na-
tion or international actor
behaved themselves, nuclear
weaponry would never be used
offensively, and therefore could
be dispensed with defensively
also. But we have no encourage-
ment to believe that this will
soon befall.

In the early 1960s, the United
States on the grounds that our
weapons were sufficiently po-
tent and precise to be used spar-
ingly, renounced the option of
hitting non-military targets.

marines and (to a lesser extent)
bombers. ;

This “MAD” concept is only
one of many theories that con-
template the various possibili-
ties for the use of nuclear
weapons in case of hostilities. It
is important to keep in mind,
however, that the various ‘‘op-
tions” that these plans provide
are only options. In the event of
a nuclear exchange, nobody
really knows if any sort of
nuclear battle plan would work.
But it is far, far better to have
some kind of plan to fight a
nuclear war, if the,unthinkable
happened, than to have no idea
at all on what to do. To have a
policy of “massive retaliation’
is no real policy at all. Ex-
cluding any possibility of con-
trolled escalation would force
the superpowers into the most
bloodthirsty strategy of a

(continued on page 9)

 

This is in complete accord with
the urgings of the Fathers. Mr.
Kruschev replied by announc-
ing the Soviet strategy of
targeting Detroit, Dallas, Des
Moines Mutual Assured
Destruction is immoral. It holds
the citizens, the civilian popula-
tion, of both nations hostage.
Unfortunately, the only moral
alternative for the U.S. is a
defensive posture of such over-
whelming force that the Soviets
would have no hope of launch-
ing an attack. Jackson Browne,
Fritz Mondale, and that insuf-
ferable Wm. Sloan Coffin would
have apoplexy. Which may be a
second advantage.

On the subject of deterrence:
“Doonesbury” a famous car-
toon, just in passing, defined
deterrence as the threat of ag-
gression. This has done sub-
stantial harm. Aggression and
deterrence are precisely not
identifiable. Deterrence means
to pre-empt the aggressor by
threatening a _ defensive
response. That is in no wise
identifiable with the unjust
posture of the attack.

Aresponse from one who has ‘disappeared’

A couple of weeks ago in the
Ring-tum Phi there was an
editorial about ‘‘los desa-
pericidos’’ — those students
who in the prime of their
academic career suddenly drop
out. They rarely leave school
per se but simply disappear
from the academic scene. Why?
I cannot speak for others only
because I have found few others
who have ‘dropped out’ for
quite the same reasons as I
have. However I do not doubt
that many of us share the same
underlying sense of confusion,
contradiction and betrayal.

Simply, college has not lived
up to my expectations. I came
here to grow-up. That is, I was
sure that here in college that I
would assimilate those values
requisite for a mature and
responsible adulthood. High
school had been fruitful but
primarily as a last hurrah for
adolescent freedoms. College
has from the start been a con-
tinuation of that experience. In
high school that experience was
rich, expansive and healthy. It
no longer is.

I thought I would inherit
America’s democratic legacy. I
anticipated the discovery of
true freedom and that its mean-
ing was identical to respon-
sibility. No. What we mostly in-

Reflections on a

The plethora of dogmas and
philosophies which exist to give
men a structure for his life-

environment emphasize in their .

variety and incompatibility the
absurdity of man’s existence. In
man’s search for meaning, he is
able to find whatever he looks
for wherever he looks. The
tricks and subtleties of man’s
subconscious logic free him
from objectivity in order to
allow his erection of a com-
prehensible outlook, giving his
life meaning. This is a denial of
the absurdity of man’s ex-
istence, a hard fact to absorb
without painful blows to the
self’s ego as well as to the race’s
collective ego. The hopeless-
ness of man’s situation, the bit-
ter paradoxes, and irrecon-
cilable ironies await the spirit
just ahead of periods of content-
ment and satisfaction.

The spirit begins with a few
basic needs which quickly ex-
pand into a multitude of needs,
never answered, ever growing.
Needs spring from the original
needs in such a way as to
disguise the ‘“‘bottom line’
needs. Needs are met and peel-
ed away while the basic needs
are protected by new-sprung
needs. The basic needs are held
within the spirit’s deepest
fears: far too tender and painful
to touch oneself, much too terri-
ble to show to others. These
may never be accepted or fill-
ed; they gnaw at self-confi-

herit is our fathers’ mind-set.
Here at W&L I discovered class
differentiation is based solely
on economics with disregard to
moral and ethical systems. The
lesson I learned long ago from
my grandparents was that the
rich are temporary custodians
of society’s wealth and are
bound by that understanding to
wisely invest so that society and
family can share the dividends.
The individual motivated by
materialism does not figure
here. Indeed such a person is
antithetical. This has not been
reinforced by my experience
among the elite who
characterize W&L. Also for the
first time I have come to
understand America as a racist
nation. Not emphatically but
pervasively and silently as in
the attitudes of my colleagues.
Previously shielded by liberal
rhetoric and the multi-racial
mixture of my family I had
never accepted this. In college I
have witnessed the integration
of prejudice and moreover, its
propagation. The myth of a con-
temporary and_ relevant
noblesse oblige and the stagger-
ing realization of racism in
society were the earliest of
many disappointments here at
W&L.

I have also come here to

dence and may be felt as the ut-
ter hollowness and emptiness
within one’s torso. Self-
confidence must be delusion: a
glossing over. Letting down the
delusion’s defense system in-
volves a massive destruction of
personal mythology. This
causes great pain.

If there is a single Truth
—and the absurdest of absurd-
ities, the most biting of ironies
and the deepest of paradoxes is
that one may very well exist
—can we find it? Whether it
does exist is debatable and
whether it is possible to know it
when one arrives at it — if one
can arrive at it or whether one
is simply deluded once again —
these are the barriers to cer-
titude.

The path through the un-
known to the Truth — if such a
path or destination exists at all
— must be one of pain and suf-
fering. For example, the first of
Buddha’s ‘‘Four Noble Truths’”’
is ‘Life is suffering.”’ Pain is
the purist sign of growth, ex-
perience and change. If the
Truth exists, it exists within, or
perhaps behind, the oldest,
deepest needs, fears, and pains
which exist deep within the
black hole of the spirit. To des-
cend from the comfort of the
reason and its part of the spirit
through the hellish rings of the
torso’s spiritual hole is more
terrible than the darkest of
Poe’s fiction. Whether it is
possible to bear the pain

learn. W&L advertises itself as
a liberal-arts teaching college.
This is wonderful and in fact
W&L works hard to live up to it.
Unfortunately it is rife with
pedantry. In the philosophy
department I discovered pro-
fessors so caught up in the
drama of their own particular
revelations that they have no

student must struggle alone for
academic verity and equilib-
rium.

Isn’t college also a forum for
the free exchange of ideas? In
my years here I have never
witnessed a truly spontaneous
and intellectually rigorous
discussion. As our professors

any student’s insight. In the
politics department they are
concerned largely with the
maintenance of myths. In
economics it is myth-making.
This is not to derogate the great
professors W&L does pos-
sess, even in the depart-
ments mentioned, but only to il-
lustrate the extent to which a

problems. I only want to point

“single cosmic roll of the dice.”’

Thus it may be seen that there
are many different factors
which affect the formulation of
American nuclear policy and
thus of the present arms build-
up. It is not simply a matter of
how many times we can destroy
each other. Political factors
play a large part in the develop-
ment and deployment of nu-
clear arms, as in the current
controversy involving the
deployment of cruise missiles
and Pershing II’s as another
rung on the “escalatory ladder’
in Western Europe. Theories
concerning the conduct of
nuclear war often seem to be

thus able to overcome this. Can
God be treated as above doubt
though? Is there undeniable
empirical or rational evidence
for certitude? Can the question
of whether God is a crutch ever
be conclusively answered? In
any case, the closer mystics
come to God, the weaker they
become. One reaches the
nearest union with God, decays,
and dies (for example, the
cases of Francis, Aquinas and
Merton).

Another paradox is_ the
possibility, highly probable,
that a man who has reached the
Truth and overcome, if it is

doesn’t mean that the average
person should dismiss the issue
with a wave of the hand. Issues
such as the current nuclear
buildup affect the citizenry
directly, via the huge costs
borne by taxpayers, as well as
the chance that one day all
these weapons may be used.
The American people should
take the time to consider the
various consequences of the re-
cent military strengthening,
both good and bad, because the
American people are the ones
who are paying for it. A person
has very little right to discuss
these issues if he knows
relatively little or nothing about
them.

ments. Because of these I have
‘disappeared.”’ College is not
enlightenment. It is for me a
source of despair and resigna-
tion. It has mocked my duties as
a citizen and stripped away any
pretension of social respon-
sibility. After all isn’t W&L
where we last pay homage to
honor and first discover that it
is bogus? I think that most will

honor does not exist at W&L.
That vision of a W&L gentleman
bequeathed by the unsurpassed
Robert E. Lee is the most pain-
ful myth of all.

For this and more life, at
W&L has lost attraction. My
days are filled with cynicism,
restlessness and even bit-
terness. I feel betrayed by my
heritage and by reality. I
understand now that knowledge
holds no moral imperative. This
I had long thought to be a
distinguishing trait of man. It
seems more to be the founda-
tion of instinct rather than the
random impulse by which we
are motivated. Aspiration and

lives we treasure and live for?
Is the victory of Truth a defeat
of self? The search to under-
stand oneself and transcend it
may easily lock one either
within the self or out of the com-
munity. Does the utter absurdi-
ty of existence reach into the

It is possible to fight a just

possible to wage a war, no mat-
ter with what weaponry, in a
morally justifiable manner and
for an end which is bonum in se.
But it is better not to need to;
and that is the real and laudable
purpose of the armories in the
West. Fallen man has never liv-
ed in peace through will. But a
major war has been avoided for
an anomalously long time by
the Balance of Terror. And we
are free...so far.

word. But I hope it clears up

Compassion and the Republican Party

By CHRIS BOUQUET

How many of the
beneficiaries of Reagan’s 1981
tax cut would be willing to
sacrifice some of that tax break
to the unemployed who suffer
because of that tax cut? All
Americans should ask them-
selves the question that JFK
suggested we ask, namely,
‘What can I do for my coun-
try?’ Ronald Reagan, while
trumpetting the above idea, is
actually making a cruel end-run
around the American problem.
He is using the ‘‘trickle-down”’
theory as a screen, while main-
taining the interest of the
business community and the
very rich above the interests of
all the people of the U.S. The
richest have done little for their
country in the tragic recession
the U.S. is suffering. Yet, they
have taken much. Have they
taken their tax breaks with an
enthusiasm spurred by the cer-
tain knowledge that this money
will ‘trickle down’”’ to the least
fortunate among us? The
answer is no. They have taken
with greed, as Reagan’s own
budget director pointed out in
the Atlantic Monthly interview.
Government intrusion in the
economy has not decreased.
Reagan, who decries the
Democrats as deficit spenders,
is amassing the largest budget
deficits of all time. The
“crowding out effect’? means
massive governmental intru-
sion in the pool of available
funds. Recovery may be a
mirage if businesses cannot
borrow at reasonable rates due
to a shortage of money. In any
case, those least able to afford
privation, the working class,
will be beset by unacceptably
high unemployment for the
foreseeable future. If unem-
ployment falls to 9 percent — is
this level of human suffering ac-
ceptable? The administration

has allowed big companies to
pollute the land with impunity.
It has completely alienated, as
George Will said recently in the
Post, blacks who make up 11
percent of the population. In
1980, as Will points out,
Democrats got 86 percent of the
black vote. There is no reason to
expect it will be lower in 1984.
At the height of the recession, 11
percent of the work force faced
the grim reality of unemploy-
ment. The Reagan administra-
tion, laughed out of Washington
by congressmen with consti-
tuents out of work. Reagan has
attempted to gut federal aid to
low and middle income college
students, denying equality of
opportunity, a concept he
hypocritically touts. He has
frightened the American peo-
ple, most of whom support a
reasonable defense increase,
through dangerous saber-
rattling talk about the Soviets.
Where steady leadership in the
face of a universally recognized
threat is necessary, he offers
hysteria and fear. His leader-
ship is the cause of the nuclear
freeze movement, not Soviet in-
filtration. The nuclear sword of
Damocles hangs over the heads
of the American people. Young
couples can well wonder about
the kindness of bringing new
life into the world. As Jesus
said, woe on us all the day when
women bless their infertility.
Ronald Reagan has gone after
such ‘‘wasteful programs” as
the Center for Disease Control,
school lunches for hungry
children, child nutrition pro-
grams, legal aid for the poor,
grants for education, funds for
the elderly and the sick. All of
this adds up to an over-riding
concern for all the people of the
U.S. Only the poorest are called
to ask JFK’s question.

Apart from a certain mean-
ness, the Reagan administra-
tion is not serving the interests
of the U.S. by gutting education.
What better way to protect the

Dear Readers,

Thank you for your interest in
“Excelsior.’’ This spring, if all
goes well, we will devote ‘Ex-
celsior’’ to the issue of tech-
nology and the future: what are
the ethical dimensions of new
advances in- medical
technology? What are the
political, social and psycholog-
ical effects of the high-tech ex-
plosion? What effect will ad-
vances in military technology
have on the balance of power
between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union? What coming human
struggles will be mirrored in
the literature? The list of possi-
ble essay topics could go on and
on. The issue of Technology and

and current. Time, after all,

most of the Democratic

with the impact of the high-tech

aristocratic Republican ad-

tradiction of terms. Freedom

challenge any Republican to

cern for all the people of the
United States. Political
theorists have long warned of
the fatal mistake made when
government starts to serve a
“selfish purpose.”’ Can any
Republican show how his party

alienated 11 percent of the

I must oppose the Democratic

President Reagan is right on

“right to life’ for the unborn.
The 15 million abortions in the
U.S. since 1973 are the sign of a
sick society. But for those abor-
tions, 15 million children would
be alive today. Of course, the
quality of life argument will be

authority of the film. But his
death cannot fall outside of the
film. Its success as a work of art
depends upon the death of its
main character. Also, its suc-
cess is dependent upon an aban-
donment of the gangster genre
— an apriori form imposed upon
the content from without (by
popular appeal, producer’s
demands or some other exter-
nal instruction). Breathless
succeeds on both counts.

Though Godard’s Breathless is
generally credited with being a
masterpiece, he has alienated
many with a preponderance
towards theoretics and a
disregard for sequence and plot
especially evident in his later
films. That his films are self-
conscious constructions seems
a fair assessment. But from this
self-consciousness, there
emerges an _ ever-increasing
awareness of the dynamics of
observation, and a growing
understanding of the complex
relationship between the
observer and the observed.
Film seems to be the ideal
medium for this study, and
Godard, a critic at heart, has
proven himself the ideal direc-
tor.

about the quality of life! Isn’t
that God’s decision? Does in-
convenience to a woman give
her the right to kill a helpless
living being? As President
Reagan has pointed out, fetal
pain is a scientific fact. Can
anyone maintain that some-
thing that feels pain is not
alive? The loss of this genera-
tion of 15 million Americans is
akin to the loss of a generation
in Europe after the two World
Wars. Unbelievably, we have
done it to ourselves. Birth con-
trol is an alternative. It
prevents pregnancy. It does not
kill an already living being.

I cannot agree- with any
Democrat who espouses legaliz-
ed abortion. This, however,
does not weaken my resolve to
participate through the
Democratic party, for the
reasons I stated above. The
argument for Reagan that says,
‘Well, compare him to the bum
we used to have,”’ no longer car-
ries weight. It is a shallow at-
tempt to avoid defending the
record of Ronald Reagan. The
issue is no longer ‘‘how bad
Jimmy Carter was.’’ The issue
is ‘‘how bad is_ Ronald
Reagan?”’ I will work within my
party to change opinions
through free debate, when I
disagree with my party.
Students should get behind the
political party they feel will
best represent the nation in the
government and do likewise. If
I disagree with you, lets debate.

Schenker’ s heavy metal album
misses mark

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Entertainment Editor

Guitarist Michael Schenker
left UFO about three years ago
to start a solo career and form-
ed the Michael Schenker Group.
They soon released an excellent
album, The Michael Schenker
Group, that was noteworthy for
its hard cutting guitar riffs and
excellent use of keyboards to fill
and add depth to the back-
ground. The music was hard

rock at its best.

The group’s next album, MSG,
was a fine effort that achieved
limited commercial success on
the strength of its single “On
and On’ and a number of rock-
ing heavy metal songs, in-
cluding ‘‘Attack of the Mad
Axemen”’ and ‘“‘Are You Ready
to Rock.”’

Although cast in the same
mold, the group’s fourth album,
Assault Attack, just does not live
up to its predecessors. German-
born Schenker, who has also
played guest spots with the
Scorpions (his brother’s band),
is once again outstanding on the
guitar, and the many guitar
tracks are expertly mixed by
Martin Birch, who has also
worked with Deep Purple and
Rainbow. Unfortunately, hand-
some production and explosive
guitar riffs do not save this
album.

The album opens with the title
track, an aggressive and angry
song that is noteworthy for its
strong vocals and guitar. The
best part of the song is when
Schenker seems to pile four
guitar tracks on top of each
other, producing an outstanding
effect. Former Rainbow vocal-
ist Graham Bonnet’s choruses
are rich, but the lead vocals
lack something. The slow and
plodding ‘‘Rock You to the
Ground” follows, and does not
go anywhere. The tune im-
proves at the very end when
Schenker goes into a ferocious
lead, and the entire pace of the
song picks up. Too late.

One of the album’s best selec-
tions is ‘Desert Song,’ a
slower, mellower piece that
gives Bonnet the room to apply
himself and show what he can
do, especially on the choruses.
This song comes closest to cap-
turing the spacy, yet heavy
Style that marked the first
album. Schenker’s_ guitar
tracks on the song mesh to-
gether beautifully and contain
the undertones of subtle tech-
nical mastery that are his
trademark. Unlike Eddie Van
Halen, who simply devastates
the audience by playing as fast,
loud and hard as he can;
Schenker is more discreet,
though not inferior.

“Broken Promises’ opens
with a pounding back beat that
is soon joined by a staccato
guitar and rolling bass. Unfor-
tunately, that is all you can say
about the song. It contains a
good guitar lead, as do all MSG
songs, but that does not make
up for an annoyingly abrupt
rhythm. The song does not flow,
but often seems to lurch along,
although when Bonnet is not
singing the song does settle
down drastically and work
much better.

Schenker and Bonnet are
outstanding throughout the
album, turning in first class
performances, and the backing
of Chris Glen on bass and Ted
McKenna on drums is solid, but
the album is still flawed. At
times the group seems to be
struggling to hold the album
together, and the vocals seem to
be forced in. Generally, the
music is excellent mainstream
rock, but the lyrical content
drags the rest of the album
down.

The album’s best song is
“Ulcer,” a jumpy instrumental
that lives up to Schenker’s
reputation. Double bass drums
and a surging bass line give the
song much of its appeal, and
Schenker lays guitar upon

guitar, creating perhaps his

best instrumental yet. Although
definitely not dance music, the
song moves so much it is dif-

ficult to sit still while listening
to it.

Overall, the album does not
add up to the sum of its parts.
All the band members give solid
performances, and the produc-
tion is excellent, but something
is missing. The vocals are
sometimes muffled, but more
importantly, the lyrics are
uninteresting and do not cap-
ture the listener’s attention.
The early album’s lyrics were
ethereal, clear and interesting,
yet Assault Attack’s lyrics lack
that appeal. The early albums
were more fluid musically, not
as rough as this album.
Schenker seems constrained by
the vocals, and does not let the
guitar take the forefront nearly
as effectively as on the other
albums. He only gets to cut
loose during “‘Ulcer’’ and when
Bonnet is not singing. If the
guitars were more aggressive
and dominant over the vocals
like the other albums, Assault
Attack would be a better album.
Nonetheless, it is a pretty good
album, even if it does not equal
its predecessors, and is certain-
ly worth a look. It grows on you,
and, if you get past the vocals, it
can be quite appealing. A good,
though flawed, album.

W&L Alumni College

Looking for an unusual vaca-
tion this summer?

How about taking a trip to
Japan? Or a journey back into
the antebellum South? Or an ex-
cursion through the American
legal system? All three vaca-
tion journeys can be made
without ever’ leaving
southwestern Virginia.

The Washington and Lee
University Alumni College is of-
fering three vacation seminars
this summer on the W&L cam-
pus in Lexington.

The three one-week seminars
are ‘‘Law and Society,’’ offered
June 26 through July 2; ‘‘The
Antebellum South: American
Arcadia?”’ July 10 through July
16; and ‘Japan: Beyond the
Headlines,” July 31 through
August 6.

Each seminar will blend

relaxation and recreation with
provocative readings, lectures,
and discussions on the seminar
topics.

Washington and Lee faculty
members who are specialists in
the various areas will lead daily
lecture and discussion sessions.
Those sessions will be com-
plemented by a variety of even-
ing programs featuring such
special guests as Hollywood
film producer Paul Maslansky
and NBC News correspondent
Lloyd Dobyns, along with

several visiting performers and
faculty.

According to Robert Fure,
director of summer programs
at W&L, each program has been
carefully designed to appeal to
a general audience.

‘Although experts in various
fields will be involved, the pro-
grams are not intended for
those with special interests on-
ly,” Fure noted.

Washington and Lee held its
first alumni coliege during the
summer of 1982. It proved so
successfu) that three one-week
sessions were designed for 1983.

‘Although we had limited the
attendance to Washington and
Lee alumni and their family in
the first year, we want to make
this new and exciting program
available to anyone who is in-
terested in a vacation ex-
perience that is truly
enriching,”’ said Fure,

In addition to the sessions on
the seminar topics, the vacation
seminars will offer abundant
recreational opportunities,
ranging from tennis to golf to
hiking, as well as optional lear-
ning programs such as historic
tours, musical events, and art
classes.

Each vacation seminar will
include a separate junior pro-
gram staffed by experienced
youth counselors. Thus, the
W&L Alumni College makes a
family vacation possible.

Fure noted that the program
participants can either live on
the campus in furnished apart-
ments or commute.

Student protest in the Me generation

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Staff Writer

Student protest.

Those two words quickly in-
voke strong visual images. Im-
ages of violence, drugs, long
hair, Vietnam and Kent State.

Student protests, 1983.

Suddenly, bringing the
stereotyped concept into the
present invokes different im-
ages. This time, they are im-
ages of William and Mary
students singing Christmas
carols at their president’s
house, University of Richmond
students wearing black arm
bands, and University of
Virginia students staging an im-
promptu sit-in at a busy in-
tersection.

These images are not the only
aspect of student protests that
have changed in the past fifteen
years. No longer are students
protesting the draft, Vietnam,
and civil rights. Today, they are
protesting exam dates, diploma
sizes, fraternity closings, and
the extermination of large par-
ties.

“That trend is very true,”
said Sam Sadler, - dean of
students at the College of
William and Mary. ‘‘The issues
and the tactics (of student pro-
tests) are different. But I don’t
think the level of concern is any
different.”

He should know. In
December, Sadler encountered
a protest on the campus that in-
volved a very high level of con-
cern for thestudents involved.
The school’s calendar schedul-
ed student exams up until
Thursday, December 23. As an
ad in the student newspaper,
the Flat Hat, said.

 

‘534 students will be taking
their last final exams on Thurs-
day, December 23. 134 Resident
Assistants are required to re-
main until noon of Friday,
December 24. Because of travel
complications some _ students
will not arrive home until
Christmas Day — some may not
even make it home until after-
Christmas.”

The ad then called for the
students to ‘‘join us in wishing
President (Thomas A.) Graves
a Merry Christmas as we sing
Christmas carols outside the
president’s house.’’ Three hun-
dred students showed up for the
‘protest.’ Shortly thereafter, a
special session of weekend class
enabled the exam dates to be
moved up two days.

“T don’t know if the
Christmas caroling had any
real effect,” said Sadler. ‘‘The
students at William and Mary
are in a position with real in-
fluence on campus. Their let-
ters and speaking out were pro-
bably more effective.

“The Christmas caroling was
more symbolic. It was impor-
tant for them to express their
solidarity, the strength of their
feelings.”’

David White, president of the
W&M student association, told a
reporter at the time, ‘We
basically just hope to reinforce
our point. We want at least to
bring attention to the problems
of the calendar in general and to
make changes in it for next
year.”’

The University of Virginia
has been embroiled in two con-
troversies during this academic
year. One involved the termina-
tion of Easters, ‘the East
Coast’s Largest Party,’ and the

other a reduction in the size of
U.Va.diplomas.

The U.Va. students literally
took to the streets when it was
announced that the annual
weekend-long party had been
abolished. Four hundred
students marched into a busy
highway, U.S. 29 where they re-
mained for two hours. More
protests were promised, but ac-
cording to Steve Klein, assis-
tant dean of students, none
materialized.

‘“‘Easters was a big deal. A
student forum was arranged
with the deans there to answer
questions. It was a vehicle for
students to vent their frustra-
tions, but surprisingly, only
about 75 people came,’’ said
Klein.

The Inter-fraternity Council,
he noted, did sell T-shirts and
posters protesting the ban, in-
cluding one that cited ‘‘The
Grinch That Stole Easters.”’

“The bigger protest,” said
Klein , ‘was over that decision
to reduce the size of Virginia
diplomas. A much _ greater
number of students expressed
their feelings. They made an
impact and the decision was
made not to reduce the size.”

At the University of Rich-
mond, two fraternities, Theta
Chi and Sigma Chi, alledgedly
involved in a food fight in the
school dining hall, were closed
down for several months as a
result.

The two fraternities, as well
as The Collegian, the student
newspaper, raised protests.
Waverly Green, president of
Sigma Chi, told the newspaper,
“We don’t feel the fraternity
should be held responsible for
the alleged actions of eight in-

 

Sixth District Rep. Jim Olin, left, was interviewed live on Washington and Lee University’s cable
television station last Friday by W&L students Jim Geason, center, of Lexington and Henry Langhorne

dividuals at a non-fraternity
function. We were charged
charged and punished, but we
had no forum to present our
views.”’

Members of the two frater-
nities wore black arm bands to
express their dismay at the
disciplinary measures.

During the fall semester one
year ago, according to Dr. Dick
Mateer, dean of Richmond Col-
lege, students found another
unique way to vent their
frustrations. When a popular
professor was not granted
tenure, the students refused to
fill out a faculty evaluation
form, thus invalidating the
survey.

Even at the liberal Virginia
Commonwealth University,
known for its vocal students, the
largest protest of the past
several years has not been over
El] Salvador or nuclear pro-
liferation, but over the rights of
flyers to be stapled to telephone
poles.

Administrators talked to at
the mentioned schools have also
noticed this trend toward
students being more concerned
with issues affecting their own
well-being.

“A lot of p eople in the age
group of 18 to 22 think they have
limited power,” said Mateer.
“Since they can’t effect the big
issues, they say let’s affect
something we can do something
about.

‘“‘They know that the world’s
not going to end if the fraternity
closes or they don’t have
Easters. But they feel that they
might have some chance of
making an impact. Often, it’s
more trivial, really.”

“It’s an attitudinal change on
the part of the student,” said

Stephanie Bennett, dean of
Westhampton College at the
University of Richmond, adding
that she believes it is a return to
the ‘‘work ethic.”’

“Ten years ago, it was dif-
ferent,’’ she said. ‘“The students
were interested in the suffering
people of Biafra. They wanted
to join the Peace Corps and
VISTA. Now they are joining
IBM.”’

‘Students are more concern-
ed about themselves,’’ said
Klein. ‘It’s a ‘Me’ generation.
They are more interested in
preparation for life after col-
lege than supporting a cause.
When they do, the intensity and
longevity is minimal compared
to the sustained protests of that
other era.”’

But Sadler sees it not as a
change in the students, but as a
change in the times.

“The mood is different. The
tactics are more sophisticated.
The times aren’t as emotional
and intense as the ’60s and ’70s
with their disruption. There is
more sophistication in making
the system work for them.

“The Vietnam protests were
personal in a real way. The
males expecially were facing
the possiblity of the draft and
going to Vietnam.

“IT don’t think there is
anything comparable today.
There are no _ international
issues with the same potential
for impact,”’ Sadler said.

Yet Sadler was right when he
said the students are concen-
trating on making the system
work for them. The William and
Mary students were able to
change their exam dates. Fif-
teen years ago, they were un-
successful in ending the war.

Generals fall to Towson State, but...
rebound vs. Delaware

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

Although both teams were
unable to capitalize on
numerous extra-man_situa-
tions, Towson State prevailed
against the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team, 12-8, Saturday at
Towson, Maryland. The loss,
the Generals third in a row, put
their record at 1-3.

After W&L took a 2-0 lead in
the first four minutes on goals
by Geoff Wood and John Doub,
the Tigers ran off the next four
goals and never trailed again.

The Generals had an oppor-
tunity to tie it at three when
Towson was called for two one-
minute penalties with 2:46 left
in the first quarter. However,
W&L could not get the ball past
goalie Gavin Moag.

‘“‘They packed their defense in
right in front of the goal, giving
us the outside shot,” explained
W&L coach Jack Emmer.
“Their goalie had a couple of
nice saves when we were able to
get the ball through the crowd.”’

After falling behind 6-3 in the
second quarter the Generals
closed the gap to one goal by

halftime. Mark Knobloch and .

Geoff Wood worked the give-
and-go to perfection in the
unsettled situation with
Knobloch converting Wood’s
pass. Wood, who ended up with
two goals and five assists, then
made it 6-5 when W&L was up
one man.

‘‘He (Wood) really took ad-
vantage of the unsettled situa-
tions,”’ said Emmer. ‘He hustl-
ed real well.”

 

Water Polo

 

Erik Peterson

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity water polo standouts Erik
Peterson and Rand McClain,
who last fall led the Generals to
a 26-9 record, have received
college-division All-America
honors from the U.S. Water
Polo Coaches Association.

Peterson, a senior from
Miami, Fla, was named to the
seven-man first team for the se-

 

Two named All-American

cond straight season. McClain,
a junior from Miami, earned a
spot on the seven-man second
team, also for the second con-
secutive time.

Peterson is a two-year letter-
man who paced the Generals in
goals last fall with 134 for an
average of 3.8 per game. Mc-
Clain, a three-year letterman,
was second in assists with 63

  
  

Rand McClain

and tied-for-second in goals
with 81. The pair joined with
junior Tim Rock to serve as

team captains.
W&L’s 26-9 record included a
second straight Southern

League title and a fifth con-
secutive appearance in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Cham-
pionships where W&L placed
seventh among eight teams.

Towson could have put the
game out of reach in the third
quarter when the Generals
were down a man for almost
two minutes. The Tigers had the
same luck, however, as the
Generals did in the first
quarter. For the game, Towson
was 2-10 and W&L 3-12 on the
extra-man situation.

“There was some pretty good
goaltending on both sides
especially against the outside
shots,’’ Emmer remarked.

After John Tunney, who won
11 of 16 faceoffs for W&L,
scored at 6:40 of the third to
make it a one-goal difference
for the last time, Generals’
goalie Phil Aiken handled three
consecutive shots from point-
blank range. Towson’s Tom
Bruno scored shortly thereafter
to make it 8-6, though.

After building a six-goal lead
in the third quarter, the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team had to survive five
unanswered goals by the
University of Delaware — the
last one coming with 55 seconds
left in the game — to hold off the
Blue Hens for a 12-11 victory
Wednesday on Wilson Field.

Geoff Wood scored the third
of his five goals at 11:33 of the
third quarter to break a 6-6 tie.
Two minutes later, freshman
Caulley Derringer put in his se-
cond goal by sneaking in from
behind unchallenged. Mark
Knobloch made it 9-6 with a
hard bouncer, followed by
Wood’s second of the quarter at
the 6:09 mark. Wood then got
his last goal on an empty net
when a pass by Delaware from
midfield rolled back to its goal
and goalie David Darrell came
out of the crease but failed to
control the bouncing ball.

Freshman Todd Breithaupt
completed the 6-0 rally by put-
ting in a shot just outside the
crease after he spun off his
man.

Delaware made it close with a
5-0 run in the fourth quarter.
Two early goals by Tom Nuttle
and Randy Powers’ tally with
6:09 left, drew the Blue Hens
within three. Nuttle then notch-
ed his fifth of the game with 1:08
left after an attempt to clear by
W&L failed. Thirteen seconds
later, Powers scored while he
was on his kness to make it a
one-goal game. The Generals
controlled the ensuing faceoff
and were able to kill the clock.

W&L has games with William
and Mary and Virginia during
the Easter break.

Coach Jack Emmer said that
the Indians, who are 3-3 with an
18-14 victory over Duke cannot
be counted on to be a pushover
as they have been in past years.

“They’re much stronger,”
Emmer said. “‘They can pose a
problem with us not having a
chance to practice much before
the game.’’ The Generals won
last year in Williamsburg, 15-10.

The UVa. game will be played
Sunday before spring term
begins at 2:00 p.m. on Wilson
Field.

Netters even record

By DAVID STUART
Phi Staff Writer —

Charlie Kalocsay dragged out
a three set tennis match to a
tiebreaker before winning 6:3,
4-6, 7-6, and giving W&L a 4-2
match lead in a 7-2 win at VMI
Tuesday.

The win over VMI evened the
tennis team’s season win-loss
record to 6-6 and equalled the
victory total of the rebuilding
1982 season record of 6-17.

Playing six matches in as
many cool, windy days, the
Generals held their own turf
against a mixed schedule of
Division I, II and III teams.
Division I teams with scholar-

ships such as Harvard B team,
James Madison and George
Washington trounced W&L 9-0,
8-1 and 6-3 respectively.

Against Division II teams
from schools with limited
scholarships, the Generals did
well, drubbing Slippery Rock
State 8-1 last Thursday and
VMI. Seeing the lopsided mat-
ches that W&L_ handed
Randolph-Macon College in a
8-1 rout Saturday morning, one
can understand why the
schedule favors tougher divi-
sions.

In fact, varsity tennis coach
Gary Franke said “I was disap-
pointed we didn’t shut them
(Randolph-Macon) out,’ The

5 Baseball
Generals split away games

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
baseball team won two games
on a four-game road trip last
week to boost its Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record to
2-2 and its overall mark to 3-5.

The Generals defeated
Bridgewater College 8-7 and
beat Randolph-Macon 6-5 in the
second game of a doubleheader.
W&L lost the first game of the
doubleheader to the Yellow-
jackets 4-2 and dropped a 5-2
decision to Lynchburg College.

“I’m pleased with certain
aspects of it;’’ said W&L Coach
Jim Murdock regarding his
team’s road trip. ‘‘Overall, we
are pleased wtih our 2-2 con-
ference standing,’ he said.

Murdock said that he was
particularly pleased with his
team’s play defensively. The
only aspects of the Generals
play that Murdock was
displeased with were the
number of wild pitches by the
Generals and the lack of hitting
in the Lynchburg game.

at 6-6

No. 1 doubles pair of Craig Can-

non and Steve Denny, hopeful

candidates for Division III Na--
tional Tournament, lost a pain-

ful match 6-7, 6-2, 4-6.

Steve Denny had the best in-
dividual match record in
singles winning four and losing
a well played 5-7, 5-7 No. 2
match against Harvard.

‘Charlie Kalocsay No. 5, and
Scott Adams No. 6, both follow-
ed with 3 victories; Cannon No.
1 and Jim Irwin, No. 4 with 2.
Slumping Andy Haring went 1-4
for the week.

Haring said little but Cannon,
frustrated after his third con-
secutive loss in singles, stared
downwards and said, ‘I just
wasn’t in there, in the game
mentally.”” Cannon lost those
matches with scores of 6-4, 6-4
against Harvard and JMU and
6-3, 46, and 74 against VMI’s
Alex Thompson.

After exams the tennis team
will go on their Florida road trip
during spring break visiting
Stetson, Rollins, West Georgia,
Emory and Davidson Colleges.

Last Tuesday at Bridgewater
the Generals collected 14 hits
and picked up some good relief
pitching from sophomore Billy
White to win their first ODAC
game 8-7.

W&L scored four times in the
seventh inning to erase a 4-3
Eagles lead. The Generals
scored what turned out to be the
winning run in the eighth inn-

ing.

Freshman Hugh Finkelstein
and senior Chris Cavalline both
ripped three hits for the
Generals, while junior Kevin
Golden knocked in four RBIs.

Last Thursday in the first
game of the doubleheader at
Randolph-Macon, the Yellow-
jackets scored four times in the
first four innings en route to a
4-2 win over the Generals.

W&L collected eight hits in
the seven inning game. Finkels-
tein led the Generals’ attack
with three hits.

Senior Marty Thomas pitched
the entire game for the
Generals and took the loss.

In the nightcap of the
doubleheader the Generals

rallied from an early 3-0 deficit
to defeat Randolph-Macon 6-5.

White pitched three innings of
relief to pick up the win for the
Generals. White is now 2-1 on
the year.

Finkelstein again led the
Generals 10-hit-attack with four
hase hits.

Saturday at Lynchburg the
Generals jumped out to a 1-0
lead in the top of the first inn-
ing, but Lynchburg retalliated
with two solo home runs in the
bottom of the first and went on

 todefeat W&L 5-2.

W&L was held to three hits by
Lynchburg. Cavalline had two
doubles for the Generals and
knocked in one of the Generals’
runs,

Senior Jim Stanley was the
losing pitcher for the Generals.
Thomas pitched four and one-
third innings of solid relief for
the Generals and yielded only

Time Out....

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

...Well, now that the
showdown in New Mexico is set,
perhaps we should try to figure
out what happened — in other
words, why I was wrong — on
the road to Albuquerque
(sickening phrase courtesy of
Brent Musburger). I
guessnobody told State and
Georgia they weren’t supposed
to win their regionals, They
were supposed to showcase the
big boys. You know, ‘Thanks
guys, we'll take it from here.”
The boys from Charlotte and
Athens decided they weren't
through, though. The Dawgs
just outplayed UNC, leaving the
Heels with their mouths
agape.(Say “‘S-E-C,’’ Sam.) In
the West, U.Va. proved it
couldn’t win the big one again,
or was it that Terry Holland
proved that he couldn’t coach
the big one? In the Mideast,
although Louisville did not
deserve to get by Arkansas, the
Cards were eventually too
much for Joe B’s boys. Houston
— I was right here, obviously a
mistake — waltzed, or rather
skied, through the Midwest. As
for what happens this weekend,
uh...I’ll take the team in red... .

...1S Martina Navratilova in-
vincible, at least on the
women’s tennis circuit? The
U.S. converted Czech has

 

amassed a devastating 114-3

record since last January. Jn
three straight matches last
week she crushed three women
who had beaten her. To top it
off, she dismantled Chris Evert
Lloyd to win the final.
Navratilova is currently train-
ing via computer and is on a
diet that is chemically de-aging
her blood. (It now chemically
resembles the blood of an eight-
year old, reports ‘“‘World Ten-
nis” magazine.) It’s become so
that opponents playing the best
match of their lives only have a
chance of winning. Then again,
I heard the same things being
said about Bjorn Borg a couple
years ago. Hmmm....

...I’ve been told how horren-
dous my last predictions were.
So, to do the prognostications

for the baseball season, I’ve |

picked up a free-agent, who has
chosen to remain nameless.
(Good Start.) I’ll call him the
Prince of Jersey, and the royal
word is thus:

AL East — If Kuenn’s pitching
holds out, the Brewers should
have little trouble repeating.
Only the Yankees plus Kemp
and Baylor can hope to match
the Yankees but George may
have to sign Bruno the Law Dog
to bolster his pitching staff.

AL West — Chicago, KC, and
California all look good on
paper. The Angels will miss
Baylor though, and also, the
Royals will be in trouble if ag-
ing regulars Blue, McRae, and

Otis slow down. The Chisox
have awesome pitching, and if
any one of a horde of farm
hands proves to be a major
leaguer, they’ll be even
tougher.

NL East — This one may be too
close to call. Montreal has a lot
of power offensively, but the
Cards have few low-average
hitters. The Phillies are tough
as always at the plate, but how
long can Carlton go on? and if
Tanner’s pitchers come through
and Parker has the kind of year
he’s being paid to have, who
knows?

NL West — L.A. has, potential-
ly, the best team, although
LaSorda will be relying on
rookies in some key gaps in the
infield. Atlanta can only hope to
have the same kind of pitching
they did last year, and that
could prove crucial late in the
season. Garvey will aid the
Padres both offensively and
defensively, along with adding
some championship experience
to a team that has none. This
may be the most interesting
race of all.

...Remember, you heard it
here first. Witty fellow, isn’t
he? Address all gripes to ‘“‘The
Parkway Prophet”’...

..-Here’s something for you to
think about during finals. Those
students at NC State who also
happen to be on the basketball
team attended class on Monday
for the first time since the
beginning of March...

 

‘Cinder-fellas’ undefeated

Washington and Lee’s track
and field team claimed vic-
tories over four squads last
week to improve its record to
5-0.

W&L’s next meet will be Fri-
day, April 15 at Lynchburg.

The Generals opened the
week at Bridgewater College on
Tuesday, March 22, compiling
85 points to outdistance the host
Eagles at 49 and Eastern Men-
nonite College at 35. W&L
triumphed in ten of the meet’s
17 events.

On Friday W&L piled up 96
points to beat Newport News
Apprentice’s 56 and Emory &
Henry’s 27 on Wilson Field. The
Generals again won ten of the 17
events.

Sophomores Scott Henderson
and Chris Ives were leaders in
the victories. Henderson won
the 400-meter intermediate hur-
die events and ran on the winn-
ing 400-meter and mile-relay
entries in both meets. Ives won
the 100-meter run and the 200-
meter run on Friday, and ran on
the 400-meter relay team Tues-
day and Friday.

Tuesday’s 400-meter relay
squad also included junior Scott
Doyle and sophomore Gener

Girard. Tuesday’s mile-relay
entry also featured sophomore
Mark Pembroke, classmate
Ken Moles and freshman Chris
McGowan. On Friday Pem-

broke replaced Doyle in the 400
relay and junior Eroll Skyers
relieved Moles in the mile
relay.

(continued from page 10)

The Generals do not play
again until after exams. W&L
was scheduled to play Lock
Haven State on Wednesday in a
game postponed because of rain
from Monday.

W&L plays four
doubleheaders over spring
break. The Generals take on
Eastern Mennonite and William
and Mary at home on April 8
and 11 respectively. W&L
travels to Catholic University

on April 14 and faces Maryville

‘“‘We play Mennonite the day
after exams end,’’ Murdock
noted. “That’s kind of tough,”
he said.

The doubleheaders’ the
Generals will play at Maryville
and Catholic are the last road
ODAC contests the Generals

those games out of the way
we're in good shape,’’ Murdock
stated.
