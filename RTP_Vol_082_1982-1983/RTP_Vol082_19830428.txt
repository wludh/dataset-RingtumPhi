Shevchenko speaks on Soviet espionage

By ALLEN S. ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

The audience at Washington
and Lee University did not
gather only to hear former
Soviet ambassador Arkady
Shevchenko warn that ‘‘the
Soviet leadership’ is
dangerous.”

What pricked the ears of the
capacity crowd at Lee Chapel
Tuesday night was Shev-
chenko’s description of Soviet
intelligence and espionage ac-
tivities. The defector, who once
advised Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko and United
Nations Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim, found it ‘“‘incredible
how easily the Soviet  in-
telligence people operate in this
country.”

Shevchenko said that among
the Russian diplomatic corps in
.the United States, ‘“‘half of the
professional personnel claim to
be diplomats, but they’re pro-
fessional intelligence people.
They are spies — KGB guys, as
you call them in this country.”
This statement echoes the
French government’s estimates
that one-third of the Soviet func-
tionaries in France work full-
time for the KGB of the GRU
(their military intelligence
agency). Shevchenko also noted
the startling expulsion earlier
this month of 47 Soviet
diplomats from France. French
President Francois Mitterand
ordered the mass deportation
after his Interior Ministry
reported a disturbing increase
in Soviet intelligence efforts on
French territory.

Although Shevchenko said the
KGB is not as powerful as they
are popularly perceived in the
West, he added that “‘no nation
in the history of humanity ever
established such a kind of enor-
mous, huge intelligence and es-
pionage machinery.” This vast
network, Shevchenko warned,
may include Russian exchange
students, visiting professors
and other apparently harmless
characters. He said many of
these may be ‘co-opted’ to
complete a secret assignment
for the KGB. Shevchenko
described a captain of the
Soviet navy who, enjoyed while
working in the U.S. with an in-
ternational conference on the
Law of the Sea, complete access
to research centers. Shev-
chenko said the man only had to
give his name to obtain
documents involving American
naval programs. The Soviet
naval officer, Shevchenko said,
used the opportunity to explore
the vulnerability of Russian
submarines, which are more
‘noisy’ than their USN

counterparts. ‘‘Americans have
to understand,’’ he said, ‘‘that
most of the people who come
from the Soviet Union come
here with a specific purposes —
to steal or to get something

from this country which is in the
interest of the Soviet Union.”
This kind of free informa-
tional flow is, in Shevchenko’s
words, “the weakness and at

Number of cold checks

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

The Executive Committee
confronted Monday the peren-
nial problem of student ‘‘cold”’
checks. In its monthly report’
the Cold Check Committee
reported it may need additional
funding from the Executive
Committee unless students
begin paying the $600 outstand-
ing on bad checks, and only if
merchants turn in more checks
before the end of spring term.

“T think students are abusing
the privilege this year,’’ said
Randall Jacoby, treasurer of
the Cold Check Committee. The
chairman of the Cold Check
Committee, Jim Baldwin, did
not agree with Jacoby.

“I don’t think you could say
they are abusing it. Merchants
are turning in more checks now
because of the end of school,”
Baldwin noted, referring to let-
ters received by the EC and
CCC from merchants who com-
plained that no action had been
taken on bad checks they had
submitted.

Vice-President Morgan Grif-
fith proposed stiffer penalties
for bad checks. If no action is
taken, Griffith feared ‘‘the
whole university could end up
losing the Cold Check priv-
ilege.”’

EC President Bennett Ross
suggested that the CCC, which
has no power to make students
appear at their meetings and
pay the checks, refer problem
cases to the Student Control
Committee. Ross also proposed
that EC funds be made avail-
able to the Cold Check Commit-
tee if the need arises.

In other action Monday night,
the EC heard year-end reports
from the students on the Facul-
ty Executive and Student
Health Committees. In the lat-
ter committee, which has only
met twice this year, student

former Under _ Secretary

representative Nelson Patter-
son questioned the need for ad-

dition athletic trainers, citing .

one away J.V. lacrosse game
where no medically trained
representative was present for
either team.

“If, as the student health
handbook states, ‘the goal of
W&L is to provide health ser-
vices of the highest quality,’ I
question the present lack of suf-
ficient trainers to accompany a
lacrosse team where injuries
are common,”’ Patterson said.
He noted that the two trainers

parts in Moscow. ‘‘Soviets now
like to talk about parity,’’ said
Shevchenko, ‘‘but there is no
parity in espionage activity.”

While he was Soviet Am-
bassador to the U.N., Shev-
chenko said he discovered eight
of the 13 Soviet nationals in the
Secretariat were operatives of
the KGB or GRU, and the re-
maining five cooperated with
the spies.

Their efforts often focus on
stealing or illegally buying ‘‘in-
formation about sophisticated
technology” which the US.
government defines as state
secrets. Shevchenko offered ex-
amples of this kind of theft,
most notably the Soviet Sputnik
launching, which suddenly pre-
empted a long-term American
program. While he acknowledg-
ed the ‘‘brilliant men’ who
developed the Russian satellite,
Shevchenko said_ stolen
technology and a more fluid
bureaucratic process ensured
the Soviet success.

research and development pro-
grams, he explained, is not

own confession, understaffed.
The EC agreed to investigate
the matter.

The selection of a new student
chairman for the Student
Telephone Union (STU) was
also debated. STU chairman
Lee Feldman argued in favor of
having next year’s EC choose a
chairman for the remainder of
the spring term and next year.
Len Howard, secretary-elect
for next year’s EC, agreed,
noting that the three applica-
tions received could be review-
ed by the new EC this week.

Baby Doe rule?

By TED LeCLERCQ
Phi Staff Writer

The Department of Health
and Human Services has once
again tried to administer a law
that is both unjust and ine-
quitable. In the last two months,
HHS has unsuccessfully at-
tempted to enforce the ‘squeal
rule’ and the ‘baby doe rule.’

On Febuary 25, HHS, under
Richard Schweicker, attacked
the privacy of minors with the
‘Squeal Rule.’ As reported in
the Washington Post, the rule
forced doctors to notify parents
if their minor child received
contraceptives from a federally
funded clinic. However, this un-
just notification rule was struck
down permanently Mar. 2 ina
Washington D.C. courtroom.

Most recently, Margaret
Heckler, the new head of HHS,
attacked the judgement of
pediatricians and parents with
the ‘Baby Doe Rule.’ This policy
shift would require doctors to
prolong severly handidcapped
infants’ lives regardless of pro-

’ gnosis. The new rule forced
hospitals to post signs in every
delivery room and nursery say-
ing that withholding food or or-
dinary medical care from in-
fants is a federal offense. The
sign also included a toll-free
hotline number that anyone
suspecting a violation could use
to notify Washington. This call
would bring a barrage of
bureaucrats swarming through
the hospital. If there was a
violation, the hospital would
then lose all federal funding.

The concept of a general
policy to protect the interests of
handicapped infants is a sound
idea. The anguish and conflict
caused by a horribly deformed
infant and the question of what
to do is an extremely com-
plicated issues. Of course,
doctors are interested in giving
all proper care in supporting
the health of infants. However,
to force the indefinite use of ex-
pensive equipment and valu-
able physicians’ time without
regard for the prognosis would
be irresponsible. The physician
is interested in the quality of life
now and in the future. This so
called ‘‘quality of life’ is the

most important issue. The

Inaugural
address

May 19th

Alabama Chancellor to pre-
sent Inaugural Address at W&L

Thomas A. Bartlett, chancel-
lor of the University of
Alabama System, will address
the inaugural convocation at
Washington and Lee University
when President John D. Wilson
is formally installed on May 19.

Bartlett’s address _ will
precede the ceremony in which
Washington and Lee Rector
James M. Ballengee will ad-
minister the formal oath of of-

 

Washington’s way of saying
that the bureaucrats are better
qualified to judge the ‘“‘quality
of life’ than doctors. The HHS
action shows their insensitivity
and ineptness in dealing with a
sensitive ethical isssue.

Yet Heckler’s department
went right ahead with a rule
that conflicted directly with the
opinions of the baby’s doctors
and parents. What made this
rule such an abysmal failure at
regulating handicapped infant
care? Further, why did the
government feel it is more
qualified to decide this difficult
question?

The most glaring problem of
the ‘Baby Doe Rule’ is that it
strips doctors of any judgment
in their field of expertise.
Granted, there may be a pro-
blem with doctors erring on the
side of the parents instead of the
infants. Yet, with a hotly con-
tested ethical question, is there
ever really a totally correct
way to go? In this difficult situa-
tion, it is preposterous for an
‘outsider’ like the government
to be in control. To place the
power under total government
control is to make a mockery of
those most informed.

Not only did the rule replace
all doctor’s judgment, but
words like ‘handicap’, and
‘customary medical care, are
vague and unspecific. For such
a powerful, pre-emptive rule to
be ambiguous is unthinakble.
Extreme handicapped condi-
tions, such as brain death,
would now require life support
indefinitely. The prolongation
of a hopeless life with addi-
tional agony spread all around
would be unavoidable. It is the
doctor along with the parents
who should decide these ques-
tions.

Although the delicate ethical
questions raised by severly han-
dicapped infants were recently
brought under governmental
control with the “Baby Doe
Rule,’ on Apr. 14, a U.S. District
court Judge enjoined HHS from
enforcing the rule. In his ruling,
Judge Gerhard Gesell called
the HHS actions ‘‘arbitrary and
capricious,” and further stated
it was an_ ill-considered
response to ‘‘one of the most dif-
ficult and sensitive medical and

tees, faculty, and student
representatives, delegates from

foundations, and learned so-
cieties, representatives of
alumni groups, and the presi-
dential party.

The public is invited to attend
the inaugural ceremonies.

Political scrabble

Old-Time Democrats are, too.

The people who are CALLED
‘Liberal’ nowdays are in fact

By M. SHAW PYLE
Phi Staff Writer

You've probably noticed that
this is a fairly politicized cam-
pus. Really. We don’t riot that
often, but we do TALK politics a
lot. I have noticed that some
people are a little confused
about terms, though. I’d like to
clear that up.

Now, the job of a political col-
umnist is a lot like throwing
rocks at a hornets’ nest. Ex-
hilirating, maybe necessary,
but kind of foolhardy. I accept
that. But why am I met with
blank stares or horselaughs
when I call myself a liberal?
I’m a liberal. Barry Goldwater,
Bill Buckley and President
Reagan are liberals. (James
Watt is a nut case.) Most
Republicans and a few of us

be
ethical problems facing our
society.” When the HHS appeal-
ed the ruling, its request was
denied.

Under two secretaries, the
Health and Human Services
Department has bungled deci-
sions on two recent sensitive
ethical issues. Fortunately,
both the ‘Squeal Rule’ and the
‘Baby Doe Rule’ were enjoined
permanently from their ine-
quitable duties.

MDC 84 State
Chair meeting

Tonight

State Chairman appoint-
ments for the 1984 Mock Demo-
cratic convention have been
finalized and are posted on the
M.C. office in Room 200 of the

Left-statists. Or Social
Democrats. Or whatever. The
Liberals in fact (not in name)
are such in virtue of our firm
adherence to the principles of
John Locke. Liberals are for
free trade, free speech, and the
free market. Wherever a
government encroaches on the
liberty of people to dispose of
their goods as they damned well
please, we’re fighting it. If the
expansion of the state at the ex-
pense of these popular liberties
is justified as ‘Liberal’ you are
in the presence of a liar or a
fool.

Conservatives are the heirs of
Bismarck, Burke, and Calhoun.

 

They are Platonists, statists,
and the like. They, like the
‘Liberals’ of our day, support
the primacy of the state over its
citizens. They are collectivists,
communalists; they differ from
the Left only in terms of the end
to which they appeal to justify
their assaults on human digni-
ty. The means are in any case
the same, and equally abhor-
rent. Call one of us a Conser-
vative and you’re likely headed
for dispute. It’s not a nice word.

Now that that’s cleared up,
we can get back to the delightful
business of petty argument. For
next week, I’d like to know: Can
anyone out there think of a good
recipe for a Vodka Hollins?
First prize is a back issue of the
’Phi. Whoopee.

‘Sigma Nu officially reinstated this weekend

By WIN SISSON
Phi Staff Writer

This weekend new life will be
breathed into an old W&L tradi-
tion as the Lambda Chapter of
Sigma Nu Fraternity is official-
ly reinstated at the University.
The event will recognize the old
as well as the new when alumni,
friends, faculty, and neophytes
gather to celebrate SNU’s one
hundredth year of affiliation
with W&L. At the Centennial
celebration the new members
will be officially inducted and
the new colony will receive its
charter.

Last fall, amid dissention,
discord, and debt Sigma Nu
folded. Its resounding collapse
seemed to suggest the finality of
its demise, however, in a
relatively short period of time,
the fraternity has recolonized.
Ostensibly, this version of SNU
seems a stark contrast to its
predecessor.

During Winter term the “new
SNUs’’ led the fraternity
academic ranking with a 3.037
house average. (Chi Psi was se-
cond with 2.936.) House Presi-
dent, Chris John characterized
the new group as ‘‘diverse”’ and
said he hopes to build the image
of SNU as an_ alternative:

“more than just a place to par-

According to Dan Rodriguez,
Assistant Executive Director of
the fraternity, members of the
old order were offered admis-

sion into the new group, but
none expressed interest.
Rodriguez credits the rapid
revitalization primarily to the
enthusiasm and support of
alumni. The proximity of the
National Headquarters has also
had a positive influence on the
recolonization. Noting the
strength of campus, alumni,
and National support,
Rodriguez seemed confident of
a bright future for the new col-
ony.

However, it does not seem
that things will be simple for the
new SNU. The house holds
twenty six; the maximum
number initiating next weekend
is thirteen. The original
estimate of renovation was
100,000 dollars, but, W&L
Treasurer Stewart Eply reports
that a recent appraisal has pro-
jected a figure near 200,000
dollars.

Requiring immediate atten-
tion in the house itself is smoke
damage which extends from the
basement to the second floor.
Chris Johns characterized the
damage as basically ‘‘cos-
metic” in nature. This includes
a beam which was driven
through two walls on the third
floor.

The renovation cost has yet to
be estimated exactly. In Oc-
tober the Board of Trustees ap-

proved a financial plan propos-
ed by the national organization.
This plan would have involved

little University aid in the
recolonization effort. In light of
the recent estimate, which pro-
jects a much higher cost, a new
plan has been formulated.
Epley was emphatic in express-

ing the University’s desire to
help Sigma Nu get back on its
feet. Still, many things remain
uncertain for the new SNUs.
For a successful recolonization;
continued support from every

available facet will be
necessary. Epley’s comment
was most appropriate:
“Everything’s up in the ”
The new proposal will be
presented to President Wilson
Thursday for review.

Shevchenko

(continued from page 1)
liamentary consideration seen
in Congressional budget hear-
ings.

“The Soviet Union is ruled by
a small group of peoples — the
top members of the Politburo.”
Shevchenko identified these
men — Yuri Andropov, Andrei
Gromyko, Defense Minister
Dmitri Ustinov, Premier
Tikhonov and _ Constantin
Chernenko. The American
media, Shevchenko said, are
mistaken in reporting that An-
dropov has become the
“established, unchallenged”’
head of the USSR. He described
a continuing struggle “among

key mambers of the Politburo.”’

Despite this turmoil, Shev-
chenko stressed that there re-
mains a power elite ‘‘who did
not abandon the idea of even-
tually establishing a Soviet-
style socialism in the whole
world.” The former principal
advisor on Security Council Af-
fairs to the U.N. Secretary
General said the extension of
Soviet influence in the Third
World is a major challenge to
the U.S.

 

Shevchenko said the USSR’s

economy cannot support
massive monetary aid to
underdeveloped nations, so
“the Soviets can only give
arms.”

The CIA and the British
Foreign Office have collected
figures which support Shev-
chenko’s statement. From 1975
to 1979, the Soviets provided on-
ly $7.2 billion in economic aid to
the Third World, but gave $28.4
billion in military aid during the
same 4-year period. Shev-
chenko cited similar ratios;

predicting that “the U.S. can —

win a competition with the
Soviet Union by having some
programs for the
underdeveloped parts of the
world.”

Shevchenko attributes this
advantage in part to the
discrepancy in the defense ex-
penditures of the two super-
powers. While the U.S. devotes
about six percent of its G.N.P.

‘to defense, Shevchenko said the

Soviets ‘‘spend 25 percent, at
least.”’
When asked to assess these

figures in light of the current
sharp tone of Soviet-American
dialogue, Shevchenko cautioned
that ‘‘there is no return to the
Cold War.’’ He acknowledged
the strain of planned deploy-
ment of American missiles in
Western Europe, but said the
U.S. and the USSR still share an
overwhelming interest in
prevention of an accidental
holocaust and pursuit of nuclear
non-proliferation.

The nuclear freeze move-
ment, Shevchenko opined, is ‘‘a
reflection of the concern of the
people for the future, but it
should be a more clearly defin-
ed thing. What would you like to
freeze? Tactical weapons?

They’re not verifiable. Some
things are big enough that you
can see them from the sky and
verify them. But tactical
weapons are not...the Soviet
Union has to open all the ter-
ritories (to verification) with a
freeze.”

“In the U.S. you cannot hide
anything. Every warhead is
counted and everything is
published everywhere. In the

Soviet Union
counted.”’
Nothing is counted there, ex-
cept pounds of butter and loaves
of bread. Shevchenko said food
rationing is in force throughout
Russia, except in the largest

metropolitan areas. The
American exchange student, he
said, will certainly not be allow-

ed to see food lines. ‘They will
show you the best things, what
the Russian people did, which is

nothing is

a great people. which con-
tributed a great deal to human;
civilization. They will show all
tnat to you, but you will not see

what the Soviet regime did to
the Soviet people.”

The Soviet Regime, Shev-
chenko said, ‘‘achieved a
number of things, but they

denied one thing which is essen-
tial for any human being. The
essential is your right to think,

to do what you want to do, to
find how you would like to live.”’

“The Soviet Party would, like
a doctor, prescribe to you how
you live all the time, what you
have to do, what you have to
think.”’

David B. Dickens, associate
professor of German at
Washington and Lee Universi-

Kurt Kusenberg.

Kusenberg is a contemporary

German writer who specializes

in the very, very short story.
Though popular throughout the
world, Kusenberg’s works have

heretofore been the subject of

very little critical attention in
the United States.

Dickens is trying to change
that situation. In March
Dickens delivered a paper on
Kusenberg to the Fourth Inter-
national Conference on the Fan-

tastic in the Arts sponsored by
Florida Atlantic University in
Boca Raton, Fla. The paper was

Lax to meet Syracuse machine

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team will take on the
University of Syracuse Satur-
day on Wilson Field. Game time
has been moved back an hour to
1 p.m. to accommodate other
Spring Weekend activities.

Syracuse, 17-1, was un-
defeated at the top of the Divi-
sion I poll before it lost Satur-
day to Army. The defeat drop-
ped the Orangemen to fourth
behind Johns Hopkins, Virginia,
and Cornell.

The Orangemen, who beat the
Generals last year 15-14 while
struggling to a record of 6-4,
have returned to national pro-
minence with a strong group of
freshmen and veterans such as
attackmen Bob Seebold and
Randy Lundblad and midfielder
Art Lux.

The Generals 21-4 loss at
North Carolina Saturday gives
them a record of 3-5. The fifth-
ranked Tar Heels scored the

game’s first four goals, then ran
off 11 more in a row after Lee
Heimert got W&L’s only goal of
the first half.

North Carolina outshot W&L
68-25 in handing the Generals
their worst setback since 1969.
The Tar Heels got goals from 1
different players. é

The attack was led by Paul
Danko’s three goals. Scoring
twice were David Wingate, Mac
Ford, War Steidle, Keith Brad-
dish and defenseman Randy
Cox.

The most active player on the
field may have been Carolina’s
All America goalie, Tom Sears.
Several times in the first half he
left his crease to tell the
referees how to make calls. He
also went out to greet a W&L
player who slipped on the wet
field. He capped his antics by
rushing the length of field to pile
on top of a fight.

Heimert, with two goals, and
Joe Seifert and Todd Breithaupt
were W&L’s scorers.

Baseball

W&L scrambling for playoff berth

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s
baseball team kept its playoff
hopes alive by winning four of
its final six league games to im-
prove its Old Dominion Athletic
Conference record to 7-7-1 and
its overall mark to 8-11-1.

W&L defeated Bridgewater
College 14-13 and swept a
doubleheader with Eastern
Mennonite College 9-0 and 3-2.
W&L lost the first garhe of a
doubleheader Tuesday at
Emory and Henry 7-1, but won
the second game 9-5. Hampden-
Sydney defeated W&L 7-4.

Defending ODAC champion
Lynchburg College has clinched
a berth in the ODAC playoffs
Saturday, but W&L and four
other teams are still scrambl-
ing for the three remaining
playoff spots. Catholic Univer-
sity, Randolph-Macon, Hamp-
den-Sydney, Eastern Mennonite
and W&L are all still in the run-
ning for the playoff.

Last Thursday at Smith Field
the Generals outlasted Bridge-
water College in a 14-13
slugfest.

W&L scored five runs in the
seventh inning to open up a 14-5
lead, but the Eagles rallied.
Senior Jody Harris, normally
W&L’s shortstop, stopped the
Eagles’ rally by getting the last
two outs in the ninth to pick up a
pitching save.

Sophomore Billy White earn-
ed the win for the Generals to
raise his record to 4-1. White
was forced to leave the game in
the seventh inning when he was
hit in the head by a line drive.

Saturday at Smith Field
Hampden-Sydney scored six
runs in the sixth inning to rally
for a 7-4 victory over W&L.

W&L scored all four of its
runs in the fourth inning. Senior
Jim Daly, who had three of
W&L’s four hits in the game,
ripped a two-run double in the
inning.

Daly smashed a three-run
homer for the Generals and
junior Kevin Golden added a
two-run homer. Daly and senior
Chris Cavalline both collected
three hits for the Generals.

White pitched a complete
game while improving his
record to 5-1 on the season.
White yielded five hits, walked
none and struck out three bat-
ters.

A sparkling relief perfor-
mance by freshman Kirk Breen
and a two-run homer by Dave
Warrenfeltz earned the Gene-
rals a 3-2 win in the second

Track & Field

game of the doubleheader.

White started the second
game for W&L also, but was
removed after two of the first
three batters he faced collected
hits. While Eastern Mennonite
did score two runs in the first in-
ning, Breen, who came in for
White, did not allow a hit the
rest of the game.

Warrenfeltz’s game-winning
homer in the fifth inning was

one of only four hits for the
Generals.

The ODAC playoffs will be
held Saturday at Lynchburg Ci-
ty Stadium. At noon, Lynchburg
College, the first seed with an
11-0 record, will play the fourth-
seeded team. At 3 p.m. the se-
cond and third seeds will play.
The winners of those two games
will play in the championship
game at8 p.m.

ODAC Championships pose
Generals’ final hurdle

By CHIS FULTON
Phi Staff Writer

Competing against 25 other
Division II and III colleges in
the Mount Saint Mary’s relays
at Emmitsburg, Penn., this
past Saturday, the Generals
placed in three track events.

Gene Gerrard, Chris Ives,
Scott Henderson and Mark
Pembroke placed fifth in the
sprint medly (200m-200m-400m-
800m). Pembroke set a school
record for the 800m in his leg of
the relay; unfortunately legs of
the relays don’t count as official
records. Paul Chapman, John
Lewis, Frank Pittman, and
Angus McBryde placed sixth in
the distance relay ('mile-
Ymile-%mile-1 mile); Eric
Nelson turned in a personal best

of 130 ft. to place eighth in the
discus.

Washington and Lee will join
seven other colleges Friday and
Saturday, April 29-30, at Lynch-
burg for the seventh annual
ODAC Track and Field Cham-
pionships. In the last three
years W&L has placed third —
it’s highest finish — year miss-
ing second by a single point.

Lynchburg is the defending
champion and the favorite
again this year although accor-
ding to head coach Norris
Aldridge Lynchburg is not as
strong this year — the top con-
tenders will be Roanoke Col-
lege, Lynchburg and Wash-
ington and Lee.

Based on the top perfor-
mances going into the meet, the

favorites in all events except
Pole Vault are Lynchburg or
Washington and Lee, however
Roanoke was not figured in,
“and they’ve got some win-
ners,”’ said Aldrige; ‘‘but we’ve
got some winners and some
depth.

“In a large meet like the
ODAC winning isn’t everything.
Points are given for the top six
finishers. According to Aldrige
if both W&L’s favorites and
place men do well the Generals
could take the meet. ‘‘A lot of it
has to do with which teams
balance each other out,” he
said. There are many places
Aldrige expects the Generals to
do well and he also hopes the
relay teams, which have juggl-
ed around will perform well.

WEL fakes ODAC title

By LEE NICHOLS
Phi Sports Editor

Overcoming the formidable
handicap of having the team’s
No. 1 player studying abroad
this term, the Generals
regrouped their forces to turn
back favored Lynchburg Col-
lege and capture the seventh
annual 0.D.A.C. Championship
hled this past Monday and Tues-
day at the Lexington Country
Club. Three W&L golfers earn-
ed All-Conference honors, while
Head Coach E.G. “Buck”
Leslie was named ODAC Coach-
of-the-Year.

Seven teams teed it up at 8:30
Monday morning, only to be
greeted by brisk winds and
unseasonably cool tempera-
tures. Coach Leslie expected
the tournament to be a four-
team race between Lynchburg,
Roanoke, Randolph-Macon and
W&L. At last year’s tournament
Lynchburg took the title, edging
out Roanoke by one shot and
W&L by two.

However, after the first round
was completed, it was obvious
that the race had been narrow-
ed down to Lynchburg and
W&L. The General’s total of 309
placed them four strokes ahead
of Lynchburg; the next lowest
score was Randolph-Macon
with 325. Pacing the Generals’
first round were junior co-
captain Whit Kelly and senior
Tim Webb, both of whom card-
ed 75’s. Freshman Turner
Friedman posted a 79 and
senior Frank English an 80 to
round out W&L’s scoring. The
low score of the day was turned
in by Tom Pellatt of Lynchburg,
who hada 74. :

The weather improved slight-
ly for Tuesday’s round with the
temperature somewhat warm-
er than the previous day. Leslie
knew that it would take a total
of 615 or 616 to ward off a strong
Lynchburg guard. |

Therefore, he was understan-
dably concerned when Kelly,
the first golfer to finish, turned
in an 86. But as has been
characteristic of the squad all
season, a teammante just a few
holes behind him was picking
up the slack. Junior Steve
Jones, who had an 81 on Mon-
day, countered with a 77 in the
final round. Webb duplicated

his first day score of 75, while
English also carded a 75 and
Friedman an 80.

After the last putt was drop-
ped and the last scorecard
tallied and signed, W&L had
avenged last year’s third pace
finish by posting. a two stroke
victory over Lynchburg,
616-618. Roanoke College finish-
ed a distant third at 647,
Randolph-Macon fourth at 650,
Bridgewater fifth at 666,
Hampden-Sydney sixth at 680,
and Catholic seventh at 715.

Three W&L starters earned
All-Conference honors, which
are awarded to the top seven
finishers and ties. Webb was
medalist in the tournament at
150; English finished fourth at
155, and Jones finished in a
three-way tie for sixth at 158.
Other W&L totals were Freid-
man at 159, Kelly at 161, and
freshman Jeff Kimball at 178.

W&L’s victory earned Leslie
Coach-of-the-Year honors in his
ninth year at the General’s
helm. During the past three
seasons he has coached the
team to a 25-0 match play
record.

Commenting on the win,
Leslie cited a tremendous team
effort to be the key factor. ‘‘The
most amazing aspect of the win
was that our No. 1 man, Bruce
Blythe, was lost for the rest of
the season to studies abroad. It

was a real tribute to all our
players that they could fill the
void created by Bruce’s
absence. Leslie added, ‘“‘When
Whit had a bad round Tuesday,
Steve came in with a five round
that saved us; this was typical
of the whole season.”’

By virture of the teams
undefeated record and their im-
proved stroke average, the
Generals stand a chance of
receiving a bid to the NCAA
Division III playoff. ‘The
results go to the selection com-
mittee tomorrow; the pairings
will be announced next week.”
In the past few years W&L has
been denied a berth in the tour-
nament, but hopefully the
team’s conference title and
lowered stroke average will
convince the committee that the
Generals have earned a spot.

Looking to next year’s squad,
Leslie anticipates another fine
season as only two starters,
English and Webb, will be lost
to graduation. ‘“We’ll miss Tim
and Frank, but we’ll have a
good nucleus to build on,
especially with Bruce return-
ing.”

....Wouldn’t we all like to be
John Elway, confident that we
would be paid any salary we
asked for? If we don’t get what
we want (working conditions,
location, etec.), we can always
chose one of the many other
equally lucrative alternatives.
We also are among the best in
two big money sports, so good
that we have been asked to
wear Yankee pinstripes as well
as having every professional
football team in existence fight
for our signature on a contract.
We are the subject of feature
stories in magazines along with
countless other interviews.
Sounds like we’ve got it made,
right? Do we really? Let’s look
at the other side of Mr. Elway’s
future. I remember a similar
situation for one Danny Ainge,
who gets into fights on basket-
ball floors now. No, Danny is do-
ing fine...now. But remember
the law suits he had to go
through just to be allowed to
quit his contract with his Toron-
to baseball team and become a
member of the Boston Celtics,
only then to ride the bench for
quite a while. So, John, you bet-
ter not make the wrong deci-
sion. But that’s only the begin-
ning. Even if he makes the right
choice, though, there’s still the
little matter of living up to the
superstardom that’s been
forecast for him. They’re talk-
ing Joe Willie; John, are you
listening? Things don’t sound so
rosy, now, do they? Let’s face
it, the pressure is all on John
Elway. Everybody may want
you now, sir, but if you can’t

 

      

dance when they ask you to, life
is going to be very tough. The
sharks are out there waiting for
you. Good luck, Mr. Elway.
You’re going to need it...

.... Turning to the Colonnade,
all I can say is that it’s a shame
they don’t call lacrosse games
due to rain, because last Satur-

day’s contest with UNC would
have been a good one to call. By
the way, it’s too bad the
Generals didn’t play up to
potential last week because if
there ever was a group that
needed their heads handed to
them, it was North Carolina,
who played as clean as the day
was dry...

..Our friend from Jersey is
on hiatus, mentally, so I’ll take
over with some thoughts on the
NBA conference semi-final
situation. The Iceman and the
Spurs should have little to
worry about with Denver. In the
Portland-L.A. series the thing
to watch for are any Trailblazer
casualties. Magic, Kareem, and
Jamaal could win the series all
by themselves. Philadelphia
and Moses look tough but the
Knicks cannot be overlooked.
