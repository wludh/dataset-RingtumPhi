EC receives 49 petitions

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi News Editor

The Executive Committee
room was packed with students
Monday night, nearly all of
them running for a class office.

In all, 49 students turned in
petitions, and in the case of the
senior law representative, the
petition deadline was shifted to
Wednesday the 16. This exten-
sion was granted because the
law school has been on vaca-
tion.

Junior representative Scott
Mason and senior represen-
tative Pete Baumgaertner
reported on their research into
the open exam policy and the
question of how late students

should be able to change their
exam times.

Mason reported that of the
seven professors he spoke with,
six were in favor of an open ex-
am policy.

Pete Baumgaertner reported,
though, that the Commerce
School faculty was opposed to
the idea because of logistical
problems stemming from the
high number of students enroll-
ed in business courses. Mason
called the Commerce school
arguments’ ‘‘superficial.’’
Baumgaertner and Mason will
check alternatives for exam
distribution which may work in
the commerce school.

Mike Skardon and Mike
Drinkwater from the Contact

committee reported that they

had received a bill for $2,000 for

the Carole Simpson. speech
which was to have been paid on
Tuesday, the 15.

The student Association for
Black Unity is sponsoring Simp-
son, and wants Contact to pay
for her visit. The Contact/SABU
relationship was set up by the
EC during budget hearings to
keep organizations from asking
for funds to have speakers. The
original agreement was that
SABU and Contact were to
decide on a speaker who appeal-
ed to both organizations. The

University policy
statement on drugs

(Editor’s Note: In the wake of
the recent drug-related charges
against Washington and Lee
students, Dean Lewis John sug-
gested the Phi publish the
Universtiy’s policy on drugs.)

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity wants to help the individual
achieve a realistic understand-
ing of the consequences of drug
use and the ability to make in-
formed, responsible decisions.
The university’s prime respon-
sibilities concerning drugs are
education and counseling. Con-
sistent with these respon-
sibilities, the university wishes
to create an environment in
which students may discuss
drug problems openly and
without fear of reprisal. The
university, to foster this en-
vironment, will sponsor regular
seminars on drugs and drug use
as well as offer counseling
assistance at all times. In addi-
tion the University Library and
the University Center will
maintain special collections of
literature on drugs.

Students sincerely interested
in resolving personal drug pro-
blems may seek guidance from
uniyersity physicians, the Dean

Letter

 

of Students, and his staff; in
seeking such aid, students may
rest assured they do not risk
disciplinary action. Although
conversations with these per-
sons do not enjoy immunity
from court inquiry, they are
under no obligation to initiate
reporting of drug offenses and
would do so only in clearly
dangerous and extraordinary
situations.

Although the enforcement of

~ Jaw is not within the educational

function of the university, no
one should delude himself that
the campus is a sanctuary from
law-enforcement agents. Socie-
ty regulates by law the use of

‘drugs; it forbids even the

possession of certain drugs.
Law-enforcement agents have
jurisdiction on campus and,
when _— possessing proper
documents, may legally make
arrests or search any room or
building without prior notice to
university officials. Moreover,
the university cannot intervene
to protect an accused person
from the consequences of his ar-
rest or conviction. Whether he
is on or off campus, a student is
subject to the law.

sity does not wish to set student

Dear Editor,

The implications of the article
entitled ‘Sophomore charged
with the possession of cocaine’
published in the March 10 issue
of the Ring-tum Phi lend
themselves to comment. The
responsibility to report school
news lies with this publication.
A similar article had already
been included in the Rockbridge

area newspaper, where it
belonged. Many are of the opi-
nion that you have overstepped
your boundaries by including a
front-page article that involves
only a small number of students
at W&L, or should I say one?
Because it does not pertain to
our entire educational com-
munity, it is questionable as to

whether or not it should have
been published. In doing so, you
have not only informed us, but
harmed us. There are some of
us who do not need or wish to
know about your topic of discus-
sion and there are many who do
not appreciate the implied
label.

President Wilson, in his Con-
vocation speech, called our stu-
dent body a _ cumulative
“genius.” The stated informa-
tion detracts from our ‘‘genius”’
by self-imposing the idea of
rampant drug abuse among
students. Rampant drug abuse
is not the case.

Consider the effect of your ar-
ticle on the Rockbridge area,
prospective and _ present
students, alumni, faculty, and
parents. Also, consider the in-
justice done to the subject of the
article.

I would like to note that there
have been and will continue to
be occurences involving W&L
students that have not, will not,
and need not be mentioned in
the Ring-tum Phi. It appears
time to examine what is and is
not essential. We all want a
school publication we can be
proud of.

As in other matters of student

In arriving at its decisions, the

dividual and the university. One
principle, however, does seem
clear; an individual who uses
drugs is responsible for his ac-
tions; an individual who makes
illegal drugs available to others
is responsible not only for his
own actions, but for the actions
and welfare of others as well.
Accordingly, the severity of the
penalty may depend upon the
degree to which an individual’s
action affects the interests of
others.

SABU Ball Saturday night features SOS Band

By GREG COY
Special to the Phi

As memories of Fancy Dress
’83 become distant, Washington
and Lee University prepares
itself for another very special
and entertaining weekend. The
Student Association for Black
Unity will celebrate its 12th an-
niversary ball this Saturday,
March 19. The semi-formal ball
will be held in the Warner
Center. It will start at 8:30 p.m.
and last until 2:00 a.m.

The S.A.B.U. is very op-
timistic about the social event.
“We are anticipating a very
successful ball,’’ replied Robert
Stephen, president of S.A.B.U.
Co-chairman Ira Puryear said,
‘I think this will be the best ball
in the history of the organiza-
tion.”’ ;

Puryear has good reason to

be so positive. Performing at
the Pearl Anniversary Ball will
be recording artists The SOS
Band. This will be the bands
first appearance since their
new album SOS III was releas-
ed. Dean of Minority Affairs,
John White, said the band is
currently on tour and perform-
ing some of the material to be
used in their next album, SOS
IV. The band has just recently
had a single from their current
album go gold. White said the
band was very excited by their
accomplishments, and wants to
give an excellent performance
in Lexington to continue the
success of their album.

White was also not short on-
praise for the Mighty Majors
who will be the special guest of
the event. ‘‘We want to provide
the best quality entertainment.

Mollenhoff appears

When the ABC News program
‘20/20’ aired a report on U.S.
defense spending Thursday
night (March 10), a Washington
and Lee University journalism
professor and a W&L senior
journalism student were more
than casual viewers.

Clark Mollenhoff, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporter who is
currently a journalism pro-
fessor at W&L, and senior
Pryse Elam of Oklahoma City
both played major roles in the
production of the “20/20” seg-
ment entitled ‘You Paid For
=

At one point in the 20-minute
report, Mollenhoff appeared on
camera, interviewed by ABC’s
Geraldo Rivera about a ques-
tion of conflict of interest.

Elam’s role was strictly .

behind the scenes. He spent six
weeks helping conduct the in-
vestigation and worked for two
of those weeks as part of the
ABC production team that was
filming the segment. For his
work, Elam received credit as
an assistant producer.

“What it amounted to was
that I got a break that a 100,000
journalism students dream
about getting,’’ said Elam, who
first became involved in the in-
vestigation as part of an in-
dependent study course under
Mollenhoff.

respondent for the Des Moines
Register, Mollenhoff began

writing a series of articles for
the Washington Times in
August 1982, detailing the
stories about defense spending
abuses told by an auditor nam-
ed George Spanton in the
Defense Contract Audit Agen-
cy.

As part of the independent
study project, Mollenhoff asked
Elam to examine various
government documents on the
Spanton case.

“One thing led to another and
the case just took off,” noted
Elam. ‘Originally, ABC had
planned to do a segment on the
topic to be shown some time in
May. But they decided to push it
up and run it four days before
the start of the defense budget
hearings.”’

In addition to digging into
records and reports to provide
background and documentation
on the investigation, Elam
spent a week during W&L’s
Washington Holiday working
with the ABC News team film-
ing portions of the ‘20/20’ seg-
ment in Oklahoma City.

“The experience has been in-
valuable,” Elam noted. ‘‘Here
it is the next-to-last term of my
senior year and I have been
pulling together all the things
that I’ve been learning during
my four years.

The Mighty Majors
originated on the campus of
North Carolina A & T Universi-
ty in Greensboro in 1965 as the
result of a talent show. In less
than two years, the group went
on the road with Gene Chandler
and others. In addition they
have fronted numerous col-
iseum and auditorium concerts.
From 1968-1978, few regional
groups played a more rigorous
circuit, through Virginia, the
Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee,
and Florida than the Mighty
Majors. The eight member
group has blended full in-
strumentation and vocals to of-
fer masterful renditions of all
types of material including top

rock. Their versatility, especial-

Because of the training I had in
one of my journalism classes I

tape library and pull out the ap-
propriate pieces of the tapes.”

His experience with the ‘‘20/-

Elam to land an internship with
ABC News during the universi-
ty’s six-week spring term start-
ing in April.

misunderstood this agreement,
and thought they were to choose
a speaker and Contact would
foot the bill.

EC president Bennett Ross,
Mike Drinkwater of Contact,
and Bob Stephen of SABU met
Tuesday afternoon to discuss
the problem. According to Skar-
don, nothing was resolved and
he declined to comment further.
Drinkwater, Stephen, and Ross
could not be reached.

At the EC meeting, Ross said,
“It’s my opinion, unless it can
be shown otherwise, that Con-
tact has no responsibility to pay
this bill.”’

Fralin delivers paper

Dr. Alfred G. Fralin Jr.,
associate professor of romance
languages at Washington and
Lee, delivercd a paper to a sec-
tion on American literature at
the Twentieth Century
Literature Conference at the
University of Louisville in
February.

Fralin’s paper was a com-
parative study entitled
“Naturalistic Violence and
Purgation in Dickey’s
‘Deliverance’: Echoes of Zola’s
‘Germinal.’”’

The theme of the conference
was “Rage and Disorder.’’ The
conference attracted more than

400 participants from
throughout the United States
with novelist Michel Butor and
poet Marge Piercy serving as
keynote speakers.

Fralin has been a member of
the faculty at Washington and
Lee since 1975.

Law applications up

Applications for admission to
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Law are up by
more than 10 percent this year
over the same time a year ago
and represent the highest total
since 1979.

According to figures compil- .

ed by Edward 0. Henneman,
assistant dean of the W&L law
school, the law school has
received 1,148 applications for
the 120 places that are available
in the first-year class next fall.

That compares with the 1,040
that had been received on the
same date a year ago.

Henneman said that he ex-
pects that the total number of
applications this year will reach
1,160.

The final number of applica-
tions a year ago was 1,057. In

iJAs

1,033 applications, 1,117 in 1980,
and 1,186 in 1979. The record
was 1,295 in 1978.

Henneman noted that the
number of applications coming
from college seniors has in-
creased slightly over a year
ago.

“We are still receiving a fair-
ly large number of applications
from those individuals who
have waited a year or two after
their graduation before begin-
ning their graduate studies,”.
Henneman said. ‘‘Too, we con-
tinue to get applications from a
number of individuals who are
changing their careers. This
year, for instance, we have got-
ten a number of applications
from college professors. Last
year I was seeing more applica-

Henneman suggested the
state of the economy as a possi-
ble reason for the increase in
applicants coming directly
from college.

“The current job market
could well be involved in caus-
ing students to move directly
from undergraduate to grad-
uate school rather than trying
to compete for a job at this
point,”’ Henneman said.

In terms of objective stand-
ards as indicated by the scores
on standardized tests and col-
lege transcripts, Henneman in-
dicated that this year’s pool of
applications is ‘‘at least as good
as, if not better than, the ap-
plicants from a year ago.”

Student arrested

Christmas burglary

leads to second

cocaine arrest

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

A break-in at a fraternity
house over Christmas vacation
led to an arrest Feb. 28 of a
sophomore at Washington and
University on a drug charge.

Kevin B. O’Connor, of
Baltimore, Md., was charged
with possession of cocaine after

lab results on a substance found
in his room returned positive,
Officer David Rhodenizer of the
Lexington Police Department
said last week.

Rhodenizer said he found a
very small amount of cocaine in
O’Connor’s room at the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity house on

Lee Avenue while he was in-
vestigating a possible burglary
there.

On Dec. 17, 1982, Rhodenizer
said he discovered that the Delt

house had been broken into and
he called W&L Proctor Charles
“Murph” Murray to check it

out. All of the students living in
the house had gone home.

He and Murray entered the
house to see if anything was
missing. Rhodenizer said he

noticed a ‘‘small brown suede
pouch” with a “cutting mirror”
attached and two small glass
vials containing a _ white
powdery residue laying on a
table in O’Connor’s room.

Rhodenizer confiscated the
vials and sent them to a police
lab for analysis. The substance
was identified as cocaine on
Feb. 22.

O’Connor was released on
bond from Rockbridge County
jail. He was scheduled to take a

polygraph test Monday, March
14, but the appointment was
cancelled.

ly their beach melodies, are
superb because the Majors
have worked personally with
dozens of original recording ar-
tists including the Drifters,
Tams, Temptations, Showmen
and many others.

“By getting the Majors and
the SOS Band,’’ White said, ‘‘we
want to present a showcase
ball, a dance with a concert.’

“Obviously, this is a major
step forward for us with such a
caliber band as the SOS. We
consider it as a precedent for
us.”” White said the S.A.B.U.
Organization and Ball ‘was
founded 12 years ago by a group
of students who wanted to in-
troduce white students at that
time to a different cultural ex-
perience. We try to bring black
entertainment and groups that

have their origins in jazz,
gospel and blues. It has usually
been an event for minority
students to celebrate the end of
their Black Cultural Heritage
Week. The students did most of
the work for this weekend. They
are very excited to have an op-
portunity to produce such an
event and to see all the
previews as favorable.”

A spokesman for the
organization, Ron Magee said,
“We hope that students will
come in order to enjoy the func-
tion that we are providing for
the university.”’

Tickets for the S.A.B.U. Ball
can be purchased at the office of
minority affairs, The Minority
Cultural Center and at the
Warner Center the night of the
show.

Police crack on drunk driving

Virginia law enforcement of-
ficers arrested 4,788 more
drinking drivers in 1982 than
they did in 1981 and drinking
drivers were involved in 1,980
fewer crashes, including 50
fewer fatal crashes.

However, according to the
Department of State Police,
there were still 782 fatal
highway crashes in Virginia
during 1982. And in the 600 of

these crashes where the drink-

ing status of the drivers is
known, 278 or 46.3 percent in-
volved drinking drivers. In 10
crashes, both drivers had been

drinking.

‘‘While we have not yet made
an in-depth analysis of this in-
formation,”’ said Colonel D.M.
Slane, State Police Superinten-
dent, ‘‘these figures appear to
make quite clear the size of the
drinking driver problem. It is
often difficult to determine why
crashes and fatalities do not oc-
cur, but it would certainly ap-
pear that the increase in drink-
ing driver arrests in 1982 had a
definite impact on the reduced
number of fatalities.”

Virginia, in 1982, recorded 881
fatalities, 131 fewer than in 1981

Summer jobs in

‘My summer work in London
was the most satisfying ex-
perience of my life. The ability
to work in a foreign country
allows one to become part of the
culture, as opposed to merely
observing it as a tourist.”

This was the asseSsment of
one student who participated in
the Work Abroad program
sponsored by the Council on In-
ternational Educational Ex-
change (CIEE), the largest stu-
dent travel organization in the
United States.

Now in its 13th year, the Work
Abroad program is the only one
of its kind available in the U.S.
It cuts through the red tape to

tain temporary work in Great

and the fewest recorded since
1961 when 856 persons were kill-
ed. The 136 pedestrian deaths in
1982 were the fewest since the
Department began keeping this

‘statistic in 1934.

Statistics in 1982, 54 were 19
years of age and under 85 were

Apart from a modest pro-
gram fee of $60, the only signifi-
cant cost to the student is the

pense may be reduced by
special student and youth fares

‘*...work abroad is a tremen-
dous learning experience; one
is enriched with relationships
with fellow workers and the
adventure of supporting
oneself,”’ reported another stu-
dent who worked in a Paris
boutique.

Grad wins Luce scholarship

Kevin B. Dwyer, .a_ 1981
graduate of Washington and
Lee University, is one of 15 na-
tional winners of a_ Luce
Scholarship for a year’s study
in East Asia.

Dwyer, who is currently a
second-year law student at the
University of Virginia, becomes
the third Washington and Lee
nominee to be named a Luce
Scholar as part of the program
that began in 1974.

The Luce Scholars Program
is unique in that it excludes
Asian specialists and interna-
tional affairs experts in favor of
young men and women whose
leadership potential is in fields
totally unrelated to Asian
specialities.

‘“‘Who’s Who in American Col-

Luce Scholars are selected on
the basis of high academic
achievement, a clearly defined
career interest, leadership
potential, and adaptability to
other cultures.

Prior to Dwyer, the last W&L
graduate to be named a Luce
Scholar was Michael F. Wenke,
a 1979 graduate who spent his
year in South Korea.

The Department of State
Police is determined to make a
continuing and positive effort to
curb the problem of the drink-
ing driver and has developed a
five-year plan which includes:

—Additional training for
troopers in detecting and ap-
prehending drunk drivers.

—Recommending and work-
ing toward changes in the effi-
ciency of the arresting process
and overall effectiveness of law
enforcement’s role in reducing
the overall drunk driving pro-
blem.

—Increasing emphasis on a
public information campaign to
keep the public aware of the
hazards and consequences of
drinking and driving and to
solicit their assistance in reduc-
ing the number of drunk drivers
on Virginia’s highways.

In regard to the information
campaign, the Department has
recently published and begun
distributing a brochure detail-
ing the problem and requesting
citizens to report drinking
drivers to local and State
Police. The Department also
lists toll free numbers which
can be used for this purpose.

The jobs are primarily un-
skilled — in restaurants, stores,
and hotels — but salaries should
more than cover the cost of
room and board. Some par-
ticipants save enough money
out of their earnings to treat
themselves to a vacation once
they stop working.

Employment found by par-
ticipants in the past includes
work as chambermaids or
porters in London’s West End,

bobs

as a wool presser in New
Zealand, and as lifeguards on
the Cote d’Azur.

The program is limited to
students 18 years of age or
older. For more information

Review:

Styx’ ‘Kilroy’ hits new peaks

By BRIAN OLIGER
Special to the Phi

The five man Chicago-based
band Styx is threatening to
become one of America’s
foremost rock bands. With four
consecutive triple-platinum-
plus albums to its credit,
anything the band puts out is go-
ing to sell, regardless of its
quality or content. So, at this
point, Styx could do one of two
things: first, they could throw
together some kind of trash that
fits the mold, package it, and
promote it as something for
which every teenager should
shell out his/her lunch money,
or they could hold off, take the
time to write and perform
something that will be worth
putting on vinyl, and risk rejec-
tion because ‘‘it’s different.”’

Styx eleventh album, Kilroy
Was Here, is a commendable ex-
ercise of the second option. Like
Paradise Theatre, it is a concept
album, but Kilroy corrects the
faults which left Paradise so
open to criticism. (This new
release is actually the band’s
fourth complete concept
album.) The objective of Kilroy
Was Here seems to be threefold:
- first, to entertain, through

music, visual imagery, and an °

interesting storyline; second, to
make a point (more about that
in a minute); and third, to at-
tempt to establish Styx as
substantially more than a Top
40 rock’n’roll band with Top 40
lyrics and a Top 40 following.
On all three points, they seem to
have scored.

The storyline, briefly, tells of
Dr. Righteous, leader of Majori-
ty for Musical Morality, who,
through manipulation of the
media, is successful in his at-
tempt to have rock’n’roll ban-
ned, citing it as the sole reason
for America’s moral and
economic decline. Robert Orin
Charles Kilroy is the leader of a

suceessful rock band who is im-
prisoned because of his profes-
sion. He is aided in his escape
by Jonathon Chance, a rebel
“rock’n’roller,”’ and ‘together
the two attempt to overthrow
the Righteous regime.

The point the album seeks to
make is that while the story is
obviously pure fiction, rock and
roll will outlast- the unwar-
rented criticism it draws from
numerous fundamentalist/mor-
ality groups with questionable
motives. As most of us know,
criticism of rock ranges from
accusations of Satanic over-
tones and ‘“‘backmasking”’ to
stories of a generation of deaf,
drug-addicted derelicts. While
some of this criticism may be
rooted in truth, the vast majori-
ty appears to be ill-founded. It
should be noted that no
reference to any specific group
is made on the album in any
way, either directly, indirectly,
or implied, and that to make
such an inference, would be
presumptuous. One should also
note that Styx has been a
favorite target of such criticism
for a decade or more. A line in
the song ‘‘High Time’’ best
describes the feeling of the
group: ‘It’s not the music
that’s in question, It’s more the
freedom of expression.”’

Outstanding tunes on the
album include the single ‘‘Mr.
Roboto”’ (please don’t write this
one off until you hear it in the
context of the album), ‘‘Heavy
Metal Poisoning,” which ar-
ticulates Righteous’ perspec-
tive, and the final two tracks,
“Haven’t We Been Here
Before’ and “Don’t Let It End
(reprise).’’ Several cuts here
and there ring with (shudder) c-
c-c-commercialism, and _ if
anything detracts from the ef-
fort, that’s it in a nutshell. One
of these is the original ‘‘Don’t
Let It End,” which, although
perfectly relevant to the story,

almost seems a re-creation of
‘‘Babe.”’ Two tracks are rather
disappointing musically, al-
though for the most part they
avoid the “commercial’’ label.
These two (‘‘High Time” and
‘Double Life’) are crucial to
the concept lyrically, however,
Outstanding vocal work can be
found by Tommy Shaw on ‘“‘Just
Get Through This Night.”
‘‘Haven’t...Before’ is a
beautiful duet featuring Shaw
and Dennis DeYoung. Its com-
bination of sensitive melody
and lyrics along with flawless
vocals render it the best tune on
the album.

Each selection here has been
written and performed with the
skill, sensitivity, and, most of
all, conviction which is
characteristic of Styx. The
playing is tight but not confined,
and John Panozzo’s custom set
of Tama drums gets a workout
like it hasn’t had for a few
albums, and this provides a lot
of muscle to most of the tracks.

Starring on the album and in
the tilm of the same name, Styx
is: Dennis DeYoung (key-
boards, synthesizers, and
vocals) as Kilroy (aka ‘Mr.
Roboto’’); Chuck Panozzo
(bass guitar and bass pedals)
as Lt. Vanish; John Panozzo
(drums and percussion) as Col.
Hyde; Tommy Shaw (guitars,
synthesizers, Shami-sen, and
vocals) as Jonathon Chance;
and James Young (guitars and
vocals) as the infamous Dr.
Righteous. Finally, this pro-
mises to be one helluva con-
cert...

 

 

‘The Devil and Russia”

Harold J. Berman, scholar-in-
residence at Washington and
Lee’s Frances Lewis Law
Center, will lecture on ‘‘The
Devil and Soviet Russia’’ on
Tuesday, March 22, in Lewis
Hall, the W&L law _ school
building.

The lecture begins at 8 p.m. in
Classroom B of Lewis Hall. It is
open to the public, and admis-
sion is free.

Berman is the James Barr
Ames Professor of Law at Har-
vard University, where he has
taught since 1948. He is spend-
ing the current semester at
W&L’s Lewis Law Center, con-
ducting research on the impact
of revolutions on the law.

Berman is widely acknow-
ledged as an expert on law and
religion, on Soviet law, on
religion in the Soviet Union, and
on international trade relations.

He was a lecturer on
American law at Moscow State
University in the spring of 1982.

Arts Workshop spring concerts

Music of Johannes Brahms
and Antonin Dvorak will be
heard at spring concerts spon-
sored by the Rockbridge Fine
Arts Workshop, when the
Washington and Lee University
Glee Club will join with the
Rockbridge Chorus and Or-
chestra for performances on
March 26 and 27.

In observance of the 150th an-
niversary of Brahms’ birth in
May 1833, the Rockbridge
Chorus will sing his unaccom-
panied motet, ‘‘Make Thou In

Mary Moody Northen Inc., a
private foundation established
by Mrs. Mary Moody Northen of
Galveston, Tex., has made a
$10,000 grant jointly to the
Historic Lexington Foundation
and Washington and Lee
University to establish two
graduate fellowships this sum-
mer at the Stonewall Jackson
House in Lexington.

The Mary Moody Northen
Graduate Fellowships will offer
the opportunity for three
months of residential work and
study during the summer by
qualified students who are
enrolled in either a master’s or
doctoral program in the fields

Me, God,” with a test drawn
from Psalm 51.

The Orchestra will play three
dances from the first of two sets
of ‘Slavonic Dances’’ by
Dvorak. The orohestral version
is based on an earlier piano duet
for four hands, and Brahms,
who had taken an interest in the
career of his younger contem-
porary, was instrumental in
getting the orchestral work
published. The popularity of the
“Dances’’ brought fame and
recognition to Dvorak and

helped to establish his reputa-
tion throughout Europe and in
America. The popularity of
these highly national ‘‘Dances”’
continues.

To complete a short program
of three numbers, soprano and
bass soloists, Chorus, Glee
Club, and Orchestra will all
combine forces to perform
Dvorak’s ‘‘Te Deum,”’ a song of
praise and rejoicing to God
from the Roman Catholic
liturgy. This work was written
in June and July of 1892, just
before Dvorak’s departure for

studies, material culture, or ar-
chitectural history.

The fellowships will be
awarded on the basis of national
competition.

The program is being ad-
ministered jointly by W&L and
the Historic Lexington Founda-
tion. Pamela Hemenway Simp-
son, associate professor of art
history and assistant dean of
the college at W&L, is coor-
dinating the program on Wash-
ington and Lee’s behalf.

Ethics panel hosts four 4 pros

Luban keynote speaker

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

Fifteen Washington and Lee
juniors and seniors will meet
this weekend for the annual
Legal Ethics seminar as part of
W&L’s Society and the Profes-
sions program.

Four visiting legal experts
will discuss with the students
enrolled in a legal ethics class
subjects ranging from current
changes in legal medical ethics
to ethical codes for corporate
lawyers.

The applied ethics program
Society and the Professions,
gives W&L students an oppor-
tunity to discuss ethical issues
with professionals working in
the students chosen field.

According to Professor Louis
Hodges, who founded the pro-
gram, the eighth legal ethics
seminar will not have one over-
riding theme, but will offer a
new twist — discussion of
ethical issues common to the
United States and West Ger-
many.

speaker of the seminar who will

oppurtunities

Over 8,000 men and women,
both adults and students, will
take part in a unique program
called ‘“‘Outward Bound”’ this
year. Designed so that par-
ticipants will meet challenging
experiences in wilderness set-
tings at all times of the year,
Outward Bound courses take
place in more than a dozen
states. While many come to
Outward Bound seeking a taste
of high adventure — and they’ll
probably get it — most will
leave with a new understanding
of themselves after discovering
they are capable of doing things
they might previously have
thought ‘“‘impossible.’’ Outward
Bound believes many limits are
self-imposed.

Backpacking, mountaineer-
ing, rock climbing, canoeing,
skiing, snowshoeing, sailing,
cycling, rafting, and even cav-
ing form the core of the Out-
ward Bound experience, de-
pending on the environment in
which the course takes place.
Previous outdoor skills are un-
necessary, as is special equip-
ment other than personal
clothing and boots. Each small
group of students has one or
more expert instructors and
specialists who help them
develop outdoor and interper-
sonal skills, culminating in a
“final expedition,’’ with
minimal instructor supervision,
relying on what they have
learned during the course.

Luban, a research associate

Germany working with lawyers
there on ethical issues.

“This will be a type of cross-
cultural seminar,’ said
Hodges. “This is the first time
we have tried something like
this.”’

The eight seminars scheduled
for Thursday and Saturday will
be lead by Hodges, Luban and
three other legal experts.

presently serves on the Virginia

Hodges said he expects one of
the highlights of the seminar
will be two group discussions
taken from what the guest
speakers consider to be some of
the most difficult ethical situa-

Other areas in which ethics
classes are offered include
medicine, and journalism.

“It’s a very exciting course
and it has tended to attract
some of the best students in the
school,’’ Hodges noted.
“Because there is a variety of
issues, there is a variety of in-

Generals shorthanded by Middies

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee and
Navy lacrosse teams demon-
strated Saturday that the
numbers on the scoreboard and
those on the statistics sheet are
not always parailel. In every
category but one, the Generals
and Midshipmen were even:
shots (33-33); saves (14-13 for
Navy); ground balls collected
(58-57, Navy); and _ faceoffs
(each team won 12). However,
the Midshipmen converted on
four of their five extra-man op-
portunities to open their season
with a 13-7 victory. The
Generals, who took advantage
of only two of six man-up situa-
tions, saw their record fall to
1-1,

“It was very uncharacteristic
of our team,’’ said coach Jack
Emmer in reference to the
Generals’ defense against the
extra-man situations for Navy.
“We have to show that we can
settle down into playing in the
man-down situation.”

Emmer also noted that the of-
fense has to improve on con-
trolling the ball. ‘‘We should be
more fluid when we are a man

Generals

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Coach Jim Murdock’s
Washington and Lee baseball
team defeated West Virginia
Tech 12-6 on Smith Field Mon-
day to open its 1983 season.

W&L exploded for an 11-0 lead
after four innings and then held
off a late rally by the Bears.
Senior pitcher Jim Stanley
yielded six runs over eight in-
nings in picking up the win for
the Generals.

Leading 2-0 after an inning,
W&L scored six times in the se-
cond inning to take control of
the game. Sophomore Chip Hut-
chins’ solo home run to left field
and senior Jim Daly’s double
highlighted the six run outburst.

W&L added two more runs in
the bottom half of the third in-

up,”” he remarked. ‘‘I wasn’t
pleased with the team offense,
either. Since we don’t have a lot
of quickness, we’ve got to do
better on the six-one-six of-
fense. Right now we're not a
transition team.”’

Navy scored twice in the last
minute of the first quarter to
break a 2-2 tie. The Midshipmen
then took a commanding 8-3
lead into halftime by outscoring
W&L 4-1 in the second quarter.

The Generals closed the gap
to 9-7 by the end of the third, as
Joe Seifert notched two of his
three goals. But after John
Doub made it a_ two-goal
margin, the Generals were shut
out the rest of the way.

When the University of
Maryland comes to Wilson
Field for Sunday’s contest, Em-
mer said he expects a wide-
open attack from the Terrapins.

“They like to run and gun and
push the ball up the field in a
hurry. Very good on the transi-
tion.” he said. “Jim Wilker-
son,” an All-American at-
tackman, ‘“‘is a strong dodger.

Tim Worstell is a good man in
the crease.’’ Maryland also has
a midfielder that coach Dino
Mattessich feels is one of the

ning. Daly’s third double of the
game, a walk and a dropped fly
ball by the West Virginia Tech
right fielder were the key plays
in the inning.

Meanwhile, Stanley was
blanking the Bears during the
first four innings. However,
West Virginia Tech rallied to
score two runs in the fifth in-
ning, three runs in the seventh
and a final run in the top of the
eighth inning.

Freshman Kirk Breen came
on in relief of Stanley to retire
the Bears in the ninth inning
without yielding a run. Breen
walked the first two batters, but
retired the final three batters he
faced.

W&L ripped seven extra-base
hits in the game. In addition to
the Hutchins’ homer, juniors
Mike Walsh and Kevin Golden
both tripled. Junior Dave War-

Murdock predicts turn-around

Washington and Lee baseball
coach Jim Murdock hopes the
days of one- and two- run losses
are long gone.

“Last season it seemed that
the only thing we did consistent-
ly at times was drop close
games,”’ states the second-year
mentor whose Generals lost six
one-run contests and three two-
run encounters.

‘Winning half of those games
would have given us a winning
record (W&L finished 9-20) so
this spring we’re going to be
more aggressive at the plate, on

the base paths, and on the
mound. We’ll see if we can turn

those close games in our
favor.”
Murdock and _ first-year

assistants Jeff Stickley and
Mark McLaughlin will work
with a veteran starting line-up
to produce that aggressiveness.
The W&L diamond boasts three
lettermen on the mound and six
returning starters in the field
including senior captains Jody
Harris and Chris Cavalline.

.250 average last year and led
the squad in stolen bases with 12

Swimming

Quintet goes to Canton

Five members of _ the
Washington and Lee swim team
will journey to Canton, Ohio this
week and compete in the ninth
annual NCAA Division III
Men’s Swimming and Diving
Championships.

Junior Gary Meyer,
sophomores Taber Smith and
Bobby Pearson and freshmen
Tim Stanford and John Moody
will represent the university in
competition starting Thursday,
March 17 and running through
Saturday at Canton’s C.T.
Branin Natatorium. Three area
Division III colleges — Denison
University, Kenyon College,
and Case Western Reserve
University — will serve as host
for the Championships, which
will involve more than 300 com-
petitors representing 70 col-
leges.

W&L’s quintet will par-

ticipate in five of the Champion-
ships’ 18 events: Meyer will
swim in the 50-yard freestyle on
Thursday and in the 100-yard
freestyle on Saturday; Moody
will compete in the 100-yard
butterfly on Friday; Meyer,
Moody, Pearson and Stanford
will combine for the 800-yard
freestyle relay on Friday;

Meyer, Moody, Pearson and.

Smith will swim in the 400-yard
freestyle relay on Saturday.

“These swimmers have an
awful lot of confidence in their
potential,’ reports head coach
Page Remillard, who will ac-
company the group. ‘“‘They’re
healthier now than they’ve been
all season and they’ve spent the
last week and a half polishing
their techniques. They’ve spent
a lot of time on relay starts,
where I think they’ve shaved a
full second off their times.”

The Generals had hoped to
begin their schedule last Fri-
day, March 11 with competition
against the University of

tion as a member of the 400-

University of Rochester on Fri-
day and 7-2 against Millersville
StateonSaturday. -

“It’s early in the season,”

Denny on the sluggish, start of
the season. Denny lost a close
three set match 6-4, 5-7, 6-4
Saturday and doubles partner
Craig Cannon No. 1, lost a 6-4,
5-7, 6-3 match Friday.

“We had problems with fun-
damental errors such as not
bending the knees and being too
anxious,”’ said junior varsity
tennis coach Howard Ainsley.
Ainsley, acting coach for Gary
Franke over the weekend, add-
ed ‘“‘we have to really concen-

trate and win 3-all (3-3) points,”
referring to the no add scoring
used.

In comparison to last year’s
team, Franke believes the team
is “improved” and has ‘‘more
depth.”’ The loss of last year’s
No, 2 seed Wes Yonge is made
easier with the return of Denny
and four of the starting six
players from last year.

The starting six in singles are
Cannon, Denny, Andy Haring,
Jim Irwin, Charlie Kalocsay
and Scott Adams. Pairing in No.

Athletic Conference battles.
Nine ODAC squads will battle
for four berths in the seventh
annual Championship Tourna-
ment set for Saturday, April 30
in Salem, Virginia. W&L has
made only one tournament ap-
pearance — 1981 — but Mur-
dock thinks 1983 could mark a
second showing.

“‘We’re hungry for a return
visit. Our defense is strong, our
pitching should be improved,
and our batting potential looks
solid. If we show the ag-
gressiveness, we'll be there.”’

under battle conditions on the
playing fields of the world... and
on anyone who takes sportswear
seriously. Our extra heavyweight
International Rugby Shirt began
as THE rugby shirt, became THE
fashion shirt...and has now
become THE staple knit shirt for
sportswear in cooler weather.
Whatever the season, whatever
the reason...rugby, skiing, jog-

The International Rugby Shirt
from Canterbury is THE Winter Knit
