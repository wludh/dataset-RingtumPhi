Alumnus monitors

international trade

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

“Smokestack America is on
the verge of extinction if it can’t
face the competition or gain
protectionism,’ Dr. Alfred E.
Eckes Jr., chairman of the
United States International
Trade Commission, told a group
of W&L students Thursdav.

Eckes, a 1964 graduate of
W&L, spoke to John M. Gunn’s
International Trade class and
later to the International Law
Society at W&L law school dur-
ing his recent Lexington visit.

The I.T.C. is a government
agency which _ investigates
violations of US trade law, and
has the power to impose tariffs
and quotas on unfairly traded
imports. President Reagan
named Eckes an I.T.C. commis-
sioner in May 1981, and elevated
him to chairman on June 17 of
this year.

Eckes said in an interview

that a number of factors have
led to a sharp upturn in imports
by the United States, hurting
our domestic manufacturers.
“This surge in imports is
especially affecting our older,
established industries Steel,

automobiles, and textiles,’’ he

said. ‘‘Soon, we'll see the effects
in fields like pharmaceuticals,
computers, and semiconduc-
tors.

‘Most of our industries are
under attack from improved
competition, and it’s going to
get worse before it gets better."

The world is facing what
Eckes calls a “global reces-
sion.’ He points to unemploy-
ment of 32 million among the
developed countries alone.
“This recession has led to in-
creasing government subsidies
of firms so that they can see

their goods into the United
States clear and easy.”

Another factor in the increase
of exports to this country is the
strength of the American
dollar. ‘Since 1980,” Eckes
said, ‘‘the dollar has gained 25
to 30 percent against European
currencies, making it easier for
Europeans to ship into the
United States.”’

Eckes also cites ‘‘lagging pro-
duction’ and high wage rates as
disadvantages for American
firms. ‘Steel workers in this
country earn about $21 an
hour,” he said. ‘‘In Japan, they
earn half of that, and in Korea,
they make half of that.’’

The combined effect of these
conditions, the commissioner
said, has been ‘‘a number of un-
fair trade practices.’’ These in-
clude subsidies and ‘dumping
— selling goods at less than
their fair market value.”

A recent phenomenon is the
counterfeiting of American
goods, a problem Eckes calls
“quite widespread.”’

He said that this practice is
bringing “increasing volumes
of complaints to the I.T.C. and
to Federal courts.’’ He added,
“This suggests the need for
some sort of international con-
trol. We need to provide some
common standards.”

It is the function of the Inter-
national Trade Commission,
which Dr. Eckes heads, to com-
bat some of these problems
through the imposition of
quotas, tariffs, and negotiated
marketing agreements.

“We administer trade laws

designed to protect damaged in-

dustries,’’ Eckes told a report-
er. ‘‘We apply the law as writ-
ten, not make it,’’ he emphasiz-
ed.

William Schaufele Jr., former U.S. ambassador to Poland, tells an audience in Lee Chapel Monday

night that the Reagan administration has mishandled the Soviet pipeline sanctions from the beginning.

Schaufele speaks on Soviets

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

William E. Schaufele, Jr.,
former United States Am-
bassador to Poland, told a
university audience Monday
night that he sees no prospects
for an easing of tensions in
Poland or better relations be-
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union.

“The Soviets will make any
sacrifice that’s necessary to
keep up with the United States
in an arms race,”’ he said. “‘If
their people have to starve,
that’s all right.”’

Schaufele made his remarks
at the first presentation in this
year’s Contact series, which is
sponsored jointly by the Inter-
fraternity Council and the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the stu-
dent body.

He told the audience that the
new Soviet regime of Yuri An-
dropov will be ‘tempted to
show its manhood. If one ex-

pects the new leadership to
make concessions on important
issues like Poland and Afghan-
istan, that’s a mistake.”

According to Schaufele, An-
dropov could have a number of
his own problems with which to
cope. “I think a military coup in
the Soviet Union is possible,’’ he
said. “‘What was once un-
thinkable is now being thought
about by experts.

Turning to Poland, Schaufele
said the “sudden release’’ of
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
is ‘‘good politics for the regime,
but I’m not sure how much good
it'll do.”’

He added that ‘‘it’s too early

to say what Walesa will do as a

free man. Some say he’ll be
able to do whatever he wants.
That’s nonsense,”’

Asked about possible Soviet
interference in Poland, Schau-
fele told his listeners, ‘‘As long
as they’re convinced (Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech)

Jaruzelski can do the job,
they’ll be satisfied. ..The
Communist Party for all prac-
tical purposes is dead.’’ He said
it was “killed” and “‘lost its
credibility’ during the Solidari-
ty demonstrations. He pointed
out that it is Polish internal
security that has enforced mar-
tial law rather than the mili-

tary.

Schaufele says that there
would be ‘“‘concerted reaction
from the West”’ to a Soviet inva-
sion. In fact, he said there was
an agreement, ‘‘never made
public,’ among the NATO
powers regarding action to be
taken in such an event.

Likely results, Schaufele
says, would be that our
“economic and commercial
relationship would be cut to
zero,’’ the number of restricted
strategic materials would in-
crease, and the availability of
pipeline materials would be cut
sharply.

Schaufele said, ‘‘I think the
sanction question has been very
badly handled from the impos-
ing of the sanctions to the lifting
of the sanctions.”’

He said that although he
doesn’t oppose sanctions, ‘‘that
doesn't mean that  they’ll
work.”’

“The Polish people support
American sanctions against the
regime despite their own pro-
blems,”’ he said.

He said American aid has
been important ‘‘psychological-
ly,’’ and was partly responsible
for ‘‘the rapidity with which
Solidarity succeeded.”’

EC counts dollars

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

The Executive Committee
heard reports from the Student
Telephone Union, the Student
Financial Relations Commit-
tee, and the Student Emergency
Loan Committee at its Monday
night meeting.

Lee Feldman of the Student
Telephone Union (STU) report-
ed that both STU and Centel are
in favor of STU’s incorporating.
It had been suggested in an
earlier meeting that STU havea
law professor draw up the ar-
ticles of incorporation in order
that the organization might
save the $350 attorney’s fees.

‘‘We’d rather have somebody
more permanent in the com-
munity do it so that they can
relay our intent to the EC and
STU in the future,’ Lee
Feldman of STU reported.

Representative Ken Ter-
willeger suggested that there
were several law professors
who were well-established in
the community and capable of
handling the job.

Randall Jacoby of the Student
Financial Relations Commit-
tee, formerly Cold Check,
reported to the EC that they had
picked up a large number of
checks bounced by students
who graduated last year or left
W&L for other reasons. The

committee currently has 53
checks which have not been
paid.» Jacoby estimated that
these checks are distributed
among not more than 35 people,

saying “some people have
seven or eight bounced
checks.”’

Frank Eppes, chairman of
the Student Emergency Loan
Committee said that the com-
mittee has given out $715 in
loans thus far this year. The
committee has collected $900 of
the $2600 in outstanding loans
from last year.

Morgan Griffith, who was act-
ing president in Bennett Ross’s
absence, said he was ‘‘sorely
dissappointed in the advertis-
ing’ of Monday night’s speaker
by Contact. Griffith complained
that there were no posters put
up in the law school. John
Viahoplus moved that the EC
“castigate the chairmen of Con-
tact for failing to publicize the
speaker and to recommend that
they look into the possibility of
adding a law school member.”’
The motion passed unanimous-
ly.
Lee Feldman, speaking as a
student, stated that he thought
that this year’s committee

“was attracting second-rate
speakers”’ and that the poor at-
tendance reflected poorly on the
university,

Re

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

DuPont auditorium was buzz-

_ ing with the chatter of an expec-

tant crowd Tuesday night when
Ann Beattie entered the room
unnoticed. Famous for her pro-
vocative works published
periodically in The New Yorker
since 1973, she would soon read
two of her short stories to the
comfortable crowd of students,
professors and local notables.
They got more than they ex-
pected.

Professor Boatwright of the
English Department made the
introductions with calm and
relaxing wit as the group settled
down for the reading. Beattie
has written two novels ‘‘Chilly
Scenes of Winter” and ‘Falling
into Place” and published three
collections of short stories. °

Beattie took the podium and
put her papers down, pausing
before the crowd with her long
brown hair hanging down
almost awkwardly. Not a word
for a moment and then she slow-
ly swept her hair back and
began to speak ina soft voice.

The first story she read, call-
ed ‘‘Gravity,’’ was published in
The New Yorker, June 2, 1980.
Beattie cast a spell as she
related the story of a woman in
love with a man named Nick
who was now staying with his
old lover of ten years past, Bar-
bara.

‘As a child, I got lost in the
woods once,’’ Beattie read. “‘I
had a dandelion with me, and
I used it, hopelessly, like a
flashlight, the yellow center,
my imaginary beam. My
parents who- might have saved
me, were drunk at a back-yard
party as I kept walking the
wrong way, away from the
houses I might have seen. I
walked slower and slower, be-
ing afraid.

“Nick makes a lot of that. He
thinks I am lost in my life. ‘All
right,’ I say as he nudges me to
walk faster. ‘Everything’s sym-
bolic.’ ”

Beattie paused before going
on to her second story.

Then she told us about a man
who had been divorced and
remarried. The story is called
‘Desire’ and it was published
in The New Yorker on June 14,
1982. The man, whose name is
B.B. lives with Rona. Bryce, his
son by his first wife Robin, is
visiting them. Bryce is only a
young boy. There are no spec-

tacular events in the story. B.B.
and Rona are living their lives
in quiet futility, bickering con-
stantly over nothing.

‘“*B.B. reached out to dry his
son’s tears, or at least to touch
them, but Bryce sprang up. She
was wrong: Robin was so
wrong. Bryce was the image of
her not him — the image of
Robin saying, ‘Leave me
alone,’ ”’ Beattie read.

‘“‘People think I know the
writing business, but I really
don’t,’’ she said. But she must,
because she is_ teaching
creative writing to graduate
and undergraduate students at
the University of Virginia this
fall. She is only doing it for this
fall term and then she says she
is going to go lock herself away
and write for a while.

“T got started writing as a
hobby,” she said. ‘“‘When I was
in graduate school, I hated it so
much I started writing short
stories at night.

| Writer captures audience

‘A friend started taking them
and putting them in envelopes
and mailing them off,’’ Beattie
said. ‘‘And one of the places he
was mailing them to was The
New Yorker.’’ Publication in
1976 of her novel ‘‘Chilly Scenes
of Winter’ and a collection of
short stories from The New
Yorker, ‘‘Distortions,” launch-
ed her as a major literary
figure in America.

Beattie’s critics have brand-
ed her the spokeswoman of a
generation. ‘‘Critics are think-
ing that if they read a story by
me they are reading about all
the people who grew up in the
60s.’’ She disclaims that role.
“It is not as though I write to
prove a point, that I have a
thesis,’’ she said.

Her charcaters ‘‘have too
much money and too much
time,”’ Beattie said. ‘“‘Notice I
did not say what job, B.B. had in
‘Desire.’ I skirt the issue.”’

‘*We don’t purport to be a ma-
jor player in the trade scene ex-
cept what’s assigned to us,’’ he
said. That belies the impor-
tance of an agency that The
New York Times said in an
editorial has ‘‘wide authority.”

The Commission consists of
six members, no more than
three of whom may be from any
one political party. Eckes said
the I.T.C., which he character-
ized as having ‘extraordinary
independence,” is “bipartisan
in composition, but nonpartisan
in operation.”

Like the courts, the I.T.C. has
become increasingly overload-
ed. In 1969, for example, it
handled ten cases. This year, it
will handle between 260 and 270,
triple the number it dealt with
in the last fiscal year. ‘‘These
cases are all different,”’ Eckes
said. ‘‘Every one has a different
twist.”

He’s proud of the fact that
since 1917, when it came into be-
ing as the United States Tariff
Commission, the I.T.C. has
spent less than $20 million.

In addition to its investigative
and regulatory functions, Eckes
also cited the I.T.C.’s role’ in
providing information to in-
dustry and government. ‘We
call attention to trends without
providing prescriptions.”

In deciding a case, he said,
they look for “significant under-
selling” and “‘a connection bet-
ween the subsidized import pro-
duct and injury to the domestic
producer or industry.’’

Washington and Lee alumnus Alfred Eckes :

Eckes says our trade laws
have ‘something of a protec-
tionist caste” to them. ‘They
were designed to protect dam-
aged industries impacted by
imports. They were not de-
signed to aid foreigners.” He .
continued, ‘‘Their function is to
cushion and provide temporary
relief.”’

Nevertheless, Eckes says our
laws have free trade underpin-
nings. As proof, he cited the fact
that in 1930, the average tariff
on dutiable goods was 59 per-
cent, while today it is only 5 per-
cent.

“The Administration,” he
said, ‘‘favors enforcing the laws
on the books. We’re for trade,
free and fair. It can’t be free if
it’s not fair.”

Eckes said that with these
problems continuing and _ in-
creasing, ‘‘pressure is building
for a political solution. Protec-
tionism will increasingly be-
come a dominant political
issue.”’

He added, ‘‘It’s likely that if
these import difficulties con-
tinue, there will be growing
pressure on Congress by the in-
dustries being savaged.”’

An important indication of the
trend in international trade
practice, Eckes said, will be the
actions of the General Agree-
ment of Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) ministerial meeting in
Geneva at the end of this month
— its first top-level meeting in
nine years. Eckes says we're
“at a crossroads,’’ and the ac-
tions of the assembled minis-
ters could provide the way to a
“‘more open world.”

That’s not guaranteed, how-
ever, “There’s a lot of bit-
terness on trade issues,’’ Eckes
said. “‘They cut to the quick on
national sovereignty. The pro-
spect of lowering trade barriers
becomes a major political
issue.”’

Eckes was an honors history
student at W&L, and was a
member of the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity. He was a Phi
Beta Kappan, and graduated
magna cum laude. The Noell-
Eckes Debate Trophy, awarded
annually to an outstanding W&L
debater, was named in honor of
the commissioner and _his
debating partner, Bill Noell.

W&L tops Hoyas

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Sports Writer

W&L’s football team defeated
Georgetown 6-0 in Washington
D.C. Saturday to sew up the
Generals third consecutive win-
ning season. W&L finished 5-4
overall and 3-2 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

Neither team could mount
much of an offensive attack,
due in part to extremely gusty
wind, W&L netted only 131
yards in total offense;
Georgetown was held to 142
yards of total offense.

W&L’s only score was set up
by senior Marty Thomas’ in-
terception of a Georgetown pass
at the Hoyas’ 17 yard line.
Three plays later sophomore
quarterback John Thompson hit
senior Jerry Thompson with a
15-yard touchdown pass for the
only points the Generals would
need. The conversion attempt
failed.

W&L’s defense, which record-
ed its second shutout in a row,
stymied the Georgetown of-
fense all day. The Generals
recovered three fumbles and in-
tercepted six Georgetown
passes. Sophomore defensive
back Scott Henderson picked off
two Georgetown passes.

‘I’m pleased with the way we
bounced back to finish with a
winning record,”’ stated W&L
Coach Gary Fallon. ‘““When we
lost three in a row our players
could have just washed out the

remaining games. But they put
together one of their best
overall efforts against Catholic
and then came through to beat
Georgetown.”

Once again, senior Chris
Cavalline led the: Generals in
most offensive categories this
year. Cavalline led the team in
rushing with 483 yards and
touchdowns scored with seven
for the season. He shared the

‘team lead in pass receiving

along with senior Jerry Thomp-
son with 19 receptions.
Cavalline also had the longest
run from scrimmage and the
longest pass reception of the
year.

At quarterback, John Thomp-
son and junior Al Paradise both
saw considerable playing time,
and both completed over 50 per-
cent of their passes. Coach
Fallon has previously indicated
that he might play Paradise at
tailback next year in order to
get both Thompson and Para-
dise into the same backfield.

Defensively, three seniors led
the Generals in tackles. Ken
Manganiello notched 55 solo
tackles and John Cole and Dan
Kellermen both recorded 49 solo
tackles.

In the defensive backfield,
senior Marty Thomas led the
Generals with five intercep-
tions. Sophomore Scott Hender-
son picked off four passes and
senior Bob Jenevein in-
tercepted three aerials.

The Washington and Lee
cross country team put the
finishing touch on a successful
season by placing fourth in the
eleven-team NCAA Division III
South Regional meet last Satur-
day in Lynchburg.

ed them behind champion

Clock thwarts polo bid

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

The results of the W&L water
polo Generals’ performance
last weekend don’t tell the
whole story to the close of
another exceptional season.

The final tally from the
Eastern Championships at In-
dianapolis indicates that the
Generals finished with a win
and two defeats and a seventh
place ranking in the eight-team
field. However, a closer look
reveals just how the Generals
were playing. W&L outscored
its opponents on the weekend
40-26, had two players named to
the all-tournament team, and
may have been only 11 seconds
from at least a third place finish
in the tournament.

Remillard spoke of continual
bad breaks and the Generals’
inability to shut the door on the
Midshipmen. An 8-6 third
quarter lead was wiped out by a
3-0 Navy surge. The bad luck for
the Generals continued as Navy
took a 12-11 lead with 11 seconds
remaining. W&L set up for a
final shot, but senior Erik
Peterson, who had 13 goals on
the weekend, had his attempt
hit the post at the buzzer.

Later, Harvard took advan-
tage of an emotionally and

physically drained W&L squad
to gain an 11-9 victory in a very
physical contest that caught the
Generals by surprise. W&L
closed play against state rival
Richmond and thrashed the
Spiders 20-3. “The Richmond
game was an indication of just
how well we were playing,”’
said Remillard. —

Peterson and junior goal-
tender Kevin Kadesky received
second team All-East honors for
their efforts during the
weekend. W&L was the only
team other than the first and se-
cond place finishers (Chicago-
Loyola and Brown) to have two
players on the all-tournament
team.

W&L will lost two keys to
their success as seniors Peter-
son and Bob Marshall will

graduate this year. Remillard
had nothing but praise for the
departing standouts, saying,
“There’s no question that Erik
provided much to our program
as a strong, intimidating, defen-
sive player, and Bob was in-
strumental in our victories. The
team always came first for
-him.’”’ However, the Generals
will return five of six starters
along with goalie Kadesky.
Juniors Rand McClain, Tim
Rock, and Matt Ravencraft will
be back along with sophomore
Bobby Pearson and freshman
Tim Stanford to form a strong
core that Coach Remillard
predicts will bring home more
victories as the Generals look to
make up that 11 seconds from
last weekend.
