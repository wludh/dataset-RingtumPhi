A Journal of Interdisciplinary Thought

Focus: Technology and issues of the future

Focus, the Interdisciplinary
Symposium, is proud to present
its spring program. Our topic is
technology and issues of the
future. This subject could hard-
ly be more current and impor-
tant. Literature on the subject
is mushrooming. Congress has
formed a committee on science
and technology. Scientific and
medical journals bulge with the
latest innovations. The courts
struggle to deal with the in-
creasing technical complexity

of litigation. Philosophers and
clergy ponder the moral and
ethical dimensions of tech-
nological change. All of the 1984
presidential candidates have
addressed the issue of the im-
pact of new technology on the
American economy and way of
life. One, Senator Hart, made
technology and its promise a
centerpiece of his announce-
ment speech, having his words
broadcast by satellite over the
Cable News Network. Most im-

portantly, man’s greatest
technological innovation,
nuclear power, threatens to
take from us our joy and our
children and our very lives.
This, the spring issue of
Excelsior, is devoted to the
topic of technology and issues of
the future. Of course, we have
printed replies to the winter
issue. In addition, Focus will
present, on May 23, 1983, at 7:30.
p.m. in room 327 of the Com-
merce School, a lecture/discus-

sion on our topic. Mr. Cabell
Brand, of Salem, is our speaker.
Mr. Brand, president and CEO
of Stuart McGuire Inc., has had
a keen interest in issues of the
future for several years. He was
a key participant in ‘The
Woodland’s Conference on the
Future and the Private Sector.”’
He has aiso had extensive com-
munication with congressman
Albert Gore of the above-
mentioned House committee on
science and technology. Listed

The new evolution of man

by Rob Kurek

Man has always. been
somewhat nomadic in nature;
to deny that fact is to deny that
man has a variety of inherent
instincts that have always im-
plored him to ‘cross the next
ocean”’ or to “‘look over the next
hill.” Man is now at an historic
landmark; there are no more
‘“‘wild wests’” to be tamed or
African jungles to penetrate.
Even the frigid poles are now
marked by man’s presence;
without a doubt, man’s ultimate
manifast destiny has been
fulfilled. Our planet Earth, in
short, has become a small place
indeed. The history of civiliza-
tion is one of various periods of
expansion; a deadend on Earth
has now been reached.

There remains of course one
last frontier beyond our own
planet — that of space. What
was seen as impossible only 20
years ago is now in the realm of
the thinkable. The reality of the
space shuttle is already the first
building-block toward giving
man an even more permanent
‘beach head”’ in space. Perma-
nent space stations and space
colonization are now no longer
confined to the world of science
fiction.

A recent article in Omni
magazine entitled ‘‘Life after
Liftoff,” explains how Soviet
and American space scientists
are now engineering the next
giant step in evolution. A new
infant science all its own, cailed
bioastronautics, has evolved,
trom this new interest. Speci-
fically, Bioastronautics, is the
study of life in space. It seeks to

answer questions about such
things as how to handle medical
emergencies in zero g, and, on
an even larger scale, the
feasibility of establishing an
‘Earth-like microcosm in
space, an artifical oasis that

will support microbes, plants,
animals and man.’”!

This futuristic study is even
more remarkable in light of

' problems we still face here on

Earth. This research goes on
despite a nuclear arms race
between the superpowers
—arms race that now includes
the possibility of using laser
beams as weapons in space.
One cannot avoid the potential
yuestion of how much progress
could be made into the peaceful
expansion into space if the
superpowers could somehow
move into a true state of
peaceful co-existence with each
other. Imagine the progress

that could result from the com-
bining of Soviet and American
minds. One must add that com-
petition—healthy competition—
is not such a bad thing. In look-.
ing at history, the exploration of
the New World was spurred on
by the competitiveness of
England, Spain, Portugal,
France, and Holland. Yet if we
use space merely as another-
means of gaining military
superiority over our rivals, then
we have effectively cut off our
last hope of a frontier that
should remain weapons free for
the sake of mankind. One is
tempted, then, to say that the
Soviet Union and the United
States share too many dif-
ferences politically and
culturally to ever reach a state
of true peaceful coexistence.
Yet if one were to have told an
Englishman 500 years ago that
his nation would one day live
peacefully with and even
become an ally of France, he
would have claimed your pro-

in ‘‘Who’s Who in America”’ and
“Who’s Who in American
Politics,” Mr. Brand’s exper-
tise should lend much to our
spring program.

This spring’s program, and
our activities to date this year,
show what Focus should be in
the off-years between our major
symposiums. The first major
interdisciplinary symposium is
to take place in the spring of
1986.

position to be preposterous. in
more modern terms, following
the Korean War, who would
have guessed that China and the
United States would be on the
terms that they are now?

This. then, is the perspective
from which we must approach
our next step in evolution; to do
otherwise is to demonstrate
that, at least mentally, we have
not evolved far from our ag-
gressive and warlike ancestors
of a few thousand years ago. We
should in no way allow the in-
credible amount of progress
that has already been made in
space exploration to tarnish, for
to do so would only be to the
detriment of mankind as a
whole.

Two cheers for Tory democracy

by Markham Shaw Pyle

I am not a member of any
organized political party: I’m a
Democrat. Yet I am here reply-
ing to Mr. Bouquet’s article in
the last issue excoriating the
GOP as lacking.in compassion.
I am replying to it because it is
not a partisan, but a_philo-
sophical, squabble. He is not at-
tacking Republicans as such,
but what are called conser-
vatives (i.e., what are XIXth
century Lockean Liberals). And
I are such an animal, like many
Democrats (just as there are
‘liberal’ Republicans with
whom Mr. Bouquet would
doubtless be in substantial
agreement). And this attack on
the classic Liberal position
seems to me literally ill-
founded. Not necessarily
wrong, just grounded on a
variety of assumptions that
need an examination which
they have so far escaped. Let us
then examine them, kick their
tires as it were, before we buy.

Mr. Bouquet begins by asking
how many of the beneficiaries
of the Reagan tax cuts would be
willing to give some back to the
poor who are harmed by these
tax cuts. Several assumptions
here need examination. The
first which impresses itself
upon me is the assumption that
the poor are being hurt by these
tax cuts; that somehow the

children’s meat is being thrown
to the dogs — or fat cats. What

would it take for this to be true?
Well, it could happen if there
were a finite supply of money,
so that government expen-
ditures were a sort of zero sum
game and one man’s gain were
of necessity another’s loss. You
will see that this does not
describe the economy in this or
any land. He goes on to decry
the spirit in which the rich have
taken their tax breaks. Aside
from the vexing question of
where rich begins (because
there’re a lot of people enjoying

this tax relief that would con-
sider themselves middle class, )

we should-ask what possible
point there is to political
economy in the intention of the
investor? Moral considerations
keep any Kantian awake ’til all
hours; they are the Church’s
main concern; but the
statesman asks only what effect
is produced by various impulses
in the populace, that he may
choose the impulse likeliest to
produce the consequences
demanded by the national need.
Smith pointed out some time
back that it is self-interest that
serves to obtain from fallen
man the social cooperation that
is freely given out of love in the
Heavens. And Mr. Bouquet
dismisses the economic pro-
grams of the administration
—bipartisan support and all
—with the pejorative label
‘trickle-down.’ But the question
is, is it reasonable? And it

seems to me that it is. To leave
monies in private hands, where
those private hands have been
shown likely so to invest or
dispose of these monies that
economic growth is stimulated,
and to then reap a tax harvest
from that growth, does not
strike me as stark unreason.
Rather the reverse. And the
same applies to the sensitive.
subject of crowding out in the
money markets. To plunge the
public finance into debt is folly
where the monies raised are
directed to programs in the
state which there is no cause to
hope will repay the debt in
economic growth ripe for taxa-
tion. That is
description of ‘entitlement’ pro-
grams. But where the debt is of-
fered to purchase capital goods,

a reasonable

‘the manufacture and operation

of which redound to promotion
of real economic expansion, the
investment may be regarded as
wholly sound. Mr. Bouquet may
be startled to hear such a
Keynesian model of defense
purchasing, but the astonish-
ment will wear off; and when it
does, a consideration of the
argument on its merits will, it is
to be hoped, show the firmness
of this foundation as contrasted
with teh fundamental assump-
tions of the conventional
wisdom.

On the subject of defense pro-
per, I should like to know why
the President’s pronounce-
ments are considered
dangerous. Is it in a Socratic
sense, to the extent that truth is
dangerous? Is a statement of

military realities hysteric
demagoguery? What evidences
are there that the nuclear
freeze movement, composed
mainly it seems of those to
whom Lenin habitually referred
to as ‘useful fools,’ is the fault or
offspring of President Reagan’s
statements of fact? And, yes, I
am assuming the truth of those
statements. Journalism in this
country having finally resolved
itself into theft followed by
publication, you and I and the
KGB can verify the alleged
military strength of the nation
over breakfast with the morn-
ing paper. I confess myself at a
loss to follow Mr. Bouquet in his
analysis.

ference between us Liberals

A quick,honest word on honor

by Christopher Fulton

Unlocked buildings and self-
scheduled exams were cited as
the benefits of the honor system
by Mr. Tom Connors in the last
issue of Excelsior. Mr. Chris
Bouquet worried about stealing
pens or inadvertantly purjuring
himself. As for the merits of the
Honor system, I think we are
missing the boat with such
discussion. Nobody would say
that the purpose of the honor
system is an always-open Com-
merce School or library. The
purpose of the honor system is,
quite simply, to promote honor.
I believe that it succeeds. Yes, I
am _ too-well aware that the
spirit of the honor system is

Dear Readers,

I have several, somewhat un-
connected, things to say about
this issue of Excelsior, and
Focus in general. First, thank
you for your interest in
Excelsior and Focus. Secondly,
I would like to thank the
Publications Board for their
generous financial support for
this, the fourth issue of
Excelsior. Their vote to assist
this important co-curricular
publication is exactly the type
of intra-university support that
Focus needs. This university
has made a committment to
Focus. The 1981 University
Council White Paper on Focus
was the first step. Subsequent
Executive Committee votes for
funding Focus amplified and
deepened this committment. As
chairman this year I have work-
ed long hours, often alone, to
fulfill this university’s committ-
ment to what I feel is a good
idea: Focus, the Interdiscipli-

nary Symposium. I recently
sent a letter to the faculty ask-

often acutely bent and frequent-
ly broken without punishment.
There is no need to cite ex-
amples. The fact is that it hap-
pens.

The honor system at W&L is
successful because it allows an
honest student to remain
honest. People who want (or
need) to cheat will do so. But
without an honor system an
honest, hardworking student
would be hounded by his peers
for help. Furthermore he might
feel forced to cheat in order to
keep up. Why be left behind so
easily? And what better com-
fort it would be than to know
that ‘‘everyone else’ was doing
it too? At W&L the pressures to
give or receive unacknowledg-
ed aid are not overwhelming.

ing for ideas and support for
this university committment.
Out of over 175 faculty
members, two replied, one of
which was our outstanding and
extremely kind President, Dr.
John Wilson. Let me say I am
deeply grateful for the support I
have received. However, it is
time for the university as a
whole to make a decision about
Focus. One person can keep an
idea alive but it will take the
whole university to make it
work well. Is Washington and
Lee going to renege on its com-
mittment to Focus or is it going
to support Focus? Do we quit or
go ahead? I say we go ahead not
only because I care about this
idea but also because I care
about the university. I believe
Focus is a plus for W&L. Can
anyone argue that co-curricular
activity and lively debate is a
detriment to the university? I
do not understand why, with all
the talk about an intellectual
vacuum at W&L, there has not
been more support for an idea

An honest student is not driven

to dishonesty by the environ-

ment here. Furthermore, the
honor system, along with fear of
punishment, is an effective
deterrent to the temptation of
writing Chebyshev’s inequality
on one’s foot before a stats test.
The honor system forces harder
work, in order to honestly
remember, for example, the
correct titles of Hopkin’s son-
nets.

In short, the honor system is a
blessing for the honest student
and a risk for the dishonest one.
Most of us prefer to be honest
and are willing to accept honest
failure. The honor system helps
us steer an honest course. And
yes, I do like the luxury of self-
scheduled exams as well.

Letter from the chairman

that encourages co-curricular
activities, that is a forum for
the free exchange of ideas.
Enough said on that point —
allow me to go ahead with
another word of thanks. I would
like to thank all the people who
have made contributions to the
Excelsior this year. I especially
want to thank Markham Pyle
for his reply to my article
“Compassion and the Re-
publican Party.’’ In the interest
of allowing him his fair say, I
will not respond here to his
criticisms of the positions I
took. Suffice it to say that we
both start with differing
assumptions and that he has
somewhat distorted my posi-
tion. I intend:to respond in next
week’s Phi, the last of the
school year. Once again, thank
you for your interest. I wish all
of our readers the best of sum-
mers possible.

Sincerely,
Chris Bouquet

Soviet technological

subterfuge

Dave Johnston

As President Reagan pointed
our when he proposed the ‘‘Star
Wars’’ defense system,
technology is the weapon of the
future. Therefore, if the United
Sates is to stay militarily (and
at the same time economically )
ahead of the Soviet Union a
number of things must be done.
On the short term we have to
restrict the export of our
technology, and we also have to
start a long term revitalization
of the education system that
helped produce our technology.

The United States, because of
“yankee ingenuity,’ has been
at the forefront of the world’s
technological development ever
since the industrial revolution
crossed the Atlantic. Our strong
economy and innovation pro-
duced the world’s best railways
and such revolutionary new
ideas as the factory assembly
line.

More recently we have
developed the atom bomb, air
plane and silicon chip, all of
which are (or will be) potent
weapons. The United States is
currently at the forefront of the
race to develop new computer
technology, with a number of
our allies, most notably the
Japanese, close behind. How-
ever, the Soviets and other com-
munist powers have been able
to stay in the race because we
have let them. High-tech com-
puters are routinely sent to
Russia, and although these
computers can be used for
peaceful purposes, they can
also be used to create new
weapons and technical ad-
vances. A high-tech computer
sold to a Soviet ‘‘trade com-
pany” is now being used to
design the missiles that may

someday lay waste to the
United States.

In order to prevent further
mistakes like this from happen-
ing a number of steps must be
taken to stop American
technology from building Rus-
sian missiles. First, and most
importantly, commerce in
sophisticated computers and
software should be stopped en-
tirely. We are quite literally
selling our enemies the means
to design our destruction.

This should not include just
computers and other sophis-
ticated electronics, it should in-
clude all _ state-of-the-art
machinery. The Russians quite
simply cannot keep up with us
in many areas. When building
their natural gas _pipline,
American technology was
essential to their success. By
preventing the use of American
technology in that and similar
projects we could deal them a
staggering blow.

What we do not sell the Rus-
sians they steal. As former
Soviet Ambassador to the
United Nations Arkady Shev-
chenko stressed in his speech
here last month, the Soviets
have an incredible spy and es-
pionage ring operating in the
United States, one that is con-
centrating on stealing our high-
tech secrets and investigating
our current research and
development. In order to pre-
vent the Russians from stealing
high-tech developments we
have to demand that our
businesses and research labs be
more careful with de-
velopments and secrets. Shev-
chenko laughed at how easy it
was for Soviet spies to steal
secrets, so this must be stopped.

Another way to cut down on
the number of secrets stolen

would be to restrict the number
of Russian ‘‘diplomats”’ allowed
in the United States. Shev-
chenko said that of the people
on his UN mission staff only a
small minority were real

diplomats, that the rest were.

KGB spies. He also said that
many of the diplomats also
worked for the KGB. By cutting
the Soviet diplomacy staffs
back we may be able to cut
down on the number of spies
operating in the United States.

All of that can, and should, be
done immediately. Another
change that must be made, one
that will take much longer, is
the revitalization of our educa-
tion system. The calibre of
students graduating from our
high schools and universities is
plummetting. This is partly
because the schools do not de-
mand the students to do what
was once mandatory, and the
quality of the teaching staff is
declining. A ‘“‘wave of mediocri-
ty”’ grips the education system,
and this is reflected by the peo-
ple leaving it.

To ABM or not to ABM

By Steve Keros

Several weeks ago President
Reagan announced his intention
to mobilize American tech-
nological know-how in an effort
to produce a feasible anti-
ballistic missile defense
system. Reagan’s speech set off
a flurry of protests in the scien-
tific and political arena. Scien-
tists as a whole were mainly
very skeptical; politicians and
the media wondered aloud
about the advisability of a
system that if effective, would
probably shake the foundations
of the principle of deterrence,
which we now depend on to keep
the superpowers from  an-
nihilating and irradiating the
globe. Yet it may not be that
bad of an idea, but for a big
reason that President Reagan
may not have thought of.

Thoughts of pitched battles in
space have filled the minds of

many. But basically, up until
now, these ideas have only
come to life in Hollywood.
President Reagan, however,
proposes that the United States
engage in a concerted effort to
develop a workable Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM)
system. Yet the idea of an effec-
tive ballistic missile defense
faces serious technological
hurdles that will be very dif-
ficult to overcome.

A laser (light amplification
by the stimulated emission of
radiation) or a particle beam
weapon system would have a
great advantage over a conven-
tional ABM system in that they
would be very quick, have no
bad side effects, could switch
rapidly from target to target,
and because these beams travel
at the speed of light, could be
aimed directly at the target,
thus obviating the need to
calculate trajectory. But this is

basically where the advantages
end. Lasers, to be really effec-
tive, must operate in the
vacuum of space. Particle
beam weapons on the other
hand, would be most effective in
the atmosphere. Both lasers
and particle beams begin to lose
their strength over long
distances, through the effects of
‘thermal blooming’’ (defocus-
ing), absorbtion by other
molecules in the beam’s path,
and the gradual scattering of
the beam. Lasers, for example,
lose up to four fifths of their
energy after traveling only two
miles in the atmosphere. And
for both particle beam guns and
lasers, enough energy to inflict
fatal damage on an ap-
proaching missile cannot be
achieved until the warhead is
only a short distance away
(several kilometers). In other
words, a laser satellite could
not shoot down an enemy

Although there is not any
quick-fix for our education
system, there are a number of
steps that could be taken. First,
it is criminal that a good mind
should be wasted because of
money. For the first time a
qualified student may be unable
to attend a good college because
of financial difficulties. If
outstanding students from
weaker economic backgrounds
are to afford a college education
the current trend of less finan-
cial aid by the government has
to be stopped, otherwise our
future scientists and leaders
will be pushing brooms and
cooking hamburgers at
McDonalds.

The quality of our teachers,
expecially in public schools, has
to be improved. A major factor
in the shortage of good teachers
is the low wages teachers make.
Many people who might enter
teaching are lured to the
private sector by higher wages,
leaving less qualified people to
teach the scientists. and

missile until it is very close.
Thus the difficulty of laser
satellites handling a huge salvo
of inter-continental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs) is readily ap-
parent.

An ABM system would also
suffer in an encounter with an
ICBM attack in that it could be
easily overwhelmed. A laser or
a particle beam ABM system
would have to detect an enemy
attack, distinguish individual
targets from decoys, lock on to
a specific missile, fire, deter-
mine whether a hit was scored,
(if the target was hit), deter-
mine whether it knocked the
ICBM out, and then locate new
targets. In a full scale attack,
Kosta Tspsis estimates that in-
dividual laser satellites would
have somewhere in the ballpark
of 1.5 seconds for each missile
to calculate all that informa-
tion. And besides decoys,
ICBMs could be fitted with ef-

teachers of the future. If our
schools are to be staffed by
competent teachers they must
be paid as the highly trained
professionals they are. In some
districts janitors make more
than starting teachers, a fact
which is ludicrous.

For nearly a century now the
United States has been the
world’s supreme economic and
‘military power, but this once
secure position is being
threatened by countries follow-
ing our example and copying
our developments. If we are to
remain secure and comfortable
we have to change our ways.
Developments and innovations
costing millions cannot be sold
to a country devoted to our
destruction, and our education
system, once the best in the
world, cannot be allowed to sink
into the doldrums of apathy and
mediocrity it threatens to.
Unless we keep our secrets
secret and elevate a good
education to the position of
esteem it once held we might as
well study Russian instead of
English.

fective countermeasures like
covering the ICBM with mir-
rors to deflect laser beams. In
addition, there is no guarantee
that this kind of defense would
be 100 percent effective. If even
a few MIRVed missiles slipped
through, the damage inflicted
would be tremendous.

Lasers and particle beams
would operate against incoming
rockets by burning a hole into
the missile’s vitals, knocking it
off course. Thus these weapons
must have pinpoint accuracy to
be effective. Particle beam
weapons are extremely heavy,
and can be only deployed on the
ground or in ships. These ABM
weapons would be most effec-
tive during an ICBMs boost
phase, which occurs right after
launching, when the ICBM can-
not take evasive action. The
total time that enemy missiles
can be effectively fired upon

The smoking gun

By Les Clark

“Look at all the awful things
technology has done to us! It’s
polluted our air, land and
water, and it’s killing off all
sorts of animal and insect life!”’

“Technology is making peo-
ple lazy — look at how much
time people are spending glued
to their TVs! And just think how
much less effort it takes for us
to carry out the tasks of every-
day life!”’

scourge! These days not only
are our kids subject to powerful

| Technology and the economy:
A view from Economics 120

 

By Christopher Fulton

These days it is fashionable to
criticize modern technology for
our modern economic and en-
vironmental ills. Continued
economic and _ technological
growth, many believe, will ex-
ceed the limits of the environ-
ment precipitating a drastic,
not-good change in civilization.
We are on the verge, the argu-
ment goes, of using up our
resources, over populating the
globe with respect to food supp-
ly, and over-polluting our en-
vironment. Well, that is more or
less what I, along with the ad-
| vocates of zero Economic

Growth (ZEG), believed until
recently: that continued growth
would lead to
trophe.

The fact of the matter is that
we may never reach these
limits thanks to technology and
the good ol’ free enterprise
system. ZEG is not a realistic
policy. Resources are not
limited. As a resource becomes
scarce, its price will rise caus-
ing a number of things to hap-
pen. First, current consumption
will decrease (the principle of
supply and demand here). Se-
cond, scarcity stimulates ex-
ploration. William Baumol and
Wallace Oates point out that as
a resource is used up new ex-
vloration keeps the total supply
of a natural resource somewhat
constant.' It is no accident for
j example that the discovery u
oil in Mexico and in the British
North Sea coincided with the
OPEC embargo of 1973. Third,
as the price of a resource rises,
it becomes profitable to extract
less easily accessible resources
— again I cite North Sea Oil as
well as Alaskan oil. Further-
more lower grades of ores and
other resources become ex-
ploitable. Fourth, substitutes
are discovered as the price of a
scarce resource rises. The rise
of oil prices for example has led
to many alternate energy
sources from wood stoves to
solar energy. Fifth, recycling
becomes economically feasible.
After all, iron ores are not used
up, they are converted to a dif-

 

 

| ferent form. Why throw away

new drugs and the effects of
taking them, but mankind now
has the means to destroy every
man, woman, and child on the
earth ina matter of minutes!”’
Unfortunately such _ state-
ments are not always made by
sheer idiots as some people
might think they would be. I
can’t count the number of times
I’ve heard intelligent, and
educated people make these in-
comprehensibly narrow minded
statements. Certainly I myself
am harrowingly narrow minded

on some issues I shouldn’t be.
But the issue of technology’s

aluminum cans that are worth
money? In short, our resource
base is not a fixed pool. Con-

tinued economic growth will not
use up our resources. Rather, it
forces alternatives.
Technology is another
mitigating influence on the
scarcity of resources. Quite
simply, with improved
technology we get more and
more units of output with a
single unit of input. More iron
per ton of coal, more food per
acre of land, more information
per computer chip, and more
miles per gallon of gasoline.

A policy of Zero Economic
Growth would be very unwise, if
not itself catastrophic. Not to
even mention the monolithic
regulation and virtual socialism
it would require, it would ex-
acerbate existing problems
which only economic growth
can cure. Technological
research would suffer. Natural
governors of the market system
would be short circuited. Fur-
thermore, as Baumol and Oates
mention, economic growth is
the only chance third world na-
tions have of rising above
poverty level, especially when
one notes that birth rates in af-
fluent nations become smaller.

From an economic and
utilitarian viewpoint then,
technology is a cause of op-
timism for the future.
Technology to the rescue.

Aesthetically however, look-
ing ahead to a fast moving,
pushbutton, computerized
society is not as exciting. Time
is another scarce resource and
technology is a means to get
more out of that resource, a
scarce minute or day.
Technology is saving us time
too but I wonder if I want to be
rescued with the complications
and depersonalization of my
apple-dapple-self-stimulating-
electronically automated and
simple to operate computer.

wickedness is particularly
frustrating because it simply
reflects a much greater social |
problem: mankind’s nearly in-
vincible skill at pointing a well
intended finger in the direction
opposite of the true cause of a
problem(s).

The characteristics of the
technology issue and its par-
ticular ramifications remind us
of the adage that guns don’t kill
people, people kill people. The
problem here is that people who
hold the belief that technology
is evil appear to have the adage
backwards, saying that people

don’t kill people, guns kill peo-
ple — this is obviously
ludicrous. My point then is that
technology doesn’t use people to

cause problems, rather, people
use technology in many ways,
some of which make for great
difficulties. It is a complete
waste of effort and intellect to
get angry with technology. (It’s
not only a waste of energy — it’s
stupid — can you imagine a per-
son getting mad at a gun that
some criminal dropped after
shooting it at a person?

The waste of good intentions
is easily what is most bother-
some. As long as people think
that technology is bad, unfair,
or evil these people will con-
tribute precious little to solving
the problems that technology

“‘causes.”’

The true culprit is not
technology, it is, of course,
mankind and its individuals
(funny how that finger seems to
have missed coming to rest on
that self same culprit so many
times throughout history, isn’t
it?)

Technology is very similar to
the gun only it has the gun’s
positive and negative char-
acteristics a thousand fold. Its
potential for harm is stupen-
dous; its potential to benefit is
breathtaking and beautiful. But
as long as we stand and yell at
the gun lying on the ground the
criminal will always get away
to strike another place at
another time.

Pyle responds mernne

and those who purloined the
name a few decades back is
over the proper duties of the
State. The base assumption of
classical Liberalism is that the
State is a compact between
sovereign individuals for the
protection of life, liberty, and
(oh joy!) property. In this
model, John Kennedy’s famous
question, (What can I do for my
country?) is simply not ap-
plicable. The State exists to
serve the individual and not
contrariwise; to preserve its
contractual parties in their
liberty, to protect them from
violent death, and to keep an
eye on their worldly goods when
they go to St. Kitts-Nevis for
break. And it is ceded no more
power than is necessary for
these duties, as agreed by the
contractual parties. There is no
room for entitlements. No one
ever asks, I suppose, why, and
in virtue of what, various
classes are entitled to skim
cash off the top of the monies
given the State for the provision
of protection of life, liberty and

property. It is an interesting
question. The attempt to ex-
clude the middle by saying, ‘if it
is wrong to let folk suffer, the
State must throw money at
them,’ is invidious. To say that
the State ought not arrogate to
itself the proper duties of
private charity and Mother
Church is not to condemn peo-
ple to die in the street. If they do
begin to be found abandoned by
the more fortunate, it is time for
a Revolution, I agree, and I’ll
lead the jacqueries. But I can-
not support the fond notion that
we can safely turn to Papa
Staat to rectify these misfor-
tunes. To do so would of necessi-
ty cause the State to assume
such powers in the attempt to
redraw the national economy as
would put liberty, capital, and
finally life in danger. It is a
logical impossibility to will that
‘that which is to protect life,
liberty, and property’ (the
State, for short) should be given
the power to attack same. That
men should be clad and warm
and fed is good; and that men

should be free is, strictly, im-
perative. To attempt to make
the Staat the guarantor of both
these rights is an exercise in
futility. It is also super-
erogatory insofar as there exist
ways of dividing these respon-
sibilities so that neither right is
likely to be abrogated. And that
is the proper business of
statecraft.

In the end, I would find it dif-
ficult to justify the ‘liberal’ posi-
tions on the grounds on which
they now rest, grounds which
only confusion can excuse; nor
are there other grounds on
which to base them. But Lock
continues to speak to our condi-
tion, and a little thought will I
trust convince you of this.
Therefore, let us praise life,
liberty, and the glorious institu-
tion of property, for they have
given us the Constitution; and
that is the Father of the spirit
and letter of the Reagan agen-
da. All hail republican (small
‘r’) principles! Two cheers for
Tory democracy!

On ABM technology

(continued from page 3)

with the greatest likelihood of

incapacitating them is thus not
very long. ABM systems such
as ground based particle beam
weapons or satellite based
lasers are also a bad idea from
the standpoint that the enemy
may try to compensate for the
obvious disadvantage by
developing anti-ABM systems
such as advanced satellite
killers thus prompting another
kind of weapons race, or even
worse, by building even more
ICBMs to try and overwhelm
our ABM system in case of
nuclear war.

In addition, the question has
been raised, in the case of an
anti-ballistic missile system, as
to what the effect would be on
deterrence. One side having the
advantage of an ABM system
may be tempted to strike in the

event of a serious crisis, since it
would not seriously have to fear
any sort of retaliation. The side
with a good satellite based laser
or particle beam system could
also shoot at the opposing side’s
ICBMs while in their silos,
destroying them without any
collateral damage.

Most people would feel that
the twin factors of technological
unfeasibility anu potential
political instability should
definitely preclude any further
development of particle beam
or laser weapons. Simple
prudence would dictate
however, that the U.S. continue
to keep abreast of ABM tech-
nology. After all, one must
remember that two of the three
inventors of the laser were Rus-
sian. The Soviets are basically
on the same level as the U.S.

with particle beam technology,
and not far behind in the laser
field. One advantage to the
military development and im-
provement of lasers and parti-
cle beams that President
Reagan may not have con-
sidered is the possible civilian
scientific benefits that would
accrue. Advances in photo-
chemistry are already one
result of the military’s explora-
tion of laser technology. So in
one sense, it may be a good idea
to try and work towards an ef-
fective laser/particle beam
ABM system, since the
resulting intermediate
technological gains may have
civilian application: Yet, the
likelihood of it being deployed
anytime in the forseeable future
is very dim indeed.
