Tuesday night in Northen
Auditorium a former advisor to
Communist China called a re-
cent decision by the US.
government a ‘‘slap in the face”
to the government in Peking.
Sidney Rittenburg forsees
possible difficulties in U-.S.-
Chinese relations as a result of
negligence of U.S, decision
makers. He criticized the
government for failing to heed
the recommendations of its ad-
visors and ignoring the wishes
of the Chinese government.
Specifically Rittenburg refer-
red to the decision to grant
Chinese tennis star Hu Na
political asylum. ‘He said that
though America and China are
alike in many ways, in many
other ways they are very dif-
ferent, and in order to enhance
relations the two must strive to
appreciate their dissimilitudes.

Rittenburg described China
as a “land of glaring paradox”
and her two biggest internal
problems, starvation and birth
control in this context. Though
China has a bigger land mass
than the United States, only 7.5
percent of her land is arable.
China’s population is one of the
world’s largest (one _ billion
plus) and yet its population
growth is not yet under control.
Thus there are an increasing
number of mouths to feed with”
little land to provide the food.
Despite their ‘‘primary needs’,
Rittenburg explained, ‘The
Chinese are not a people who
live by the ledger’. He
elaborated: ‘“‘You can take a

Dr. John D. Wilson, Universi-
ty president, told a group of
students last week that he has
concerns about a number of
aspects of the social life at
W&L.

Speaking to about fifty
students in a meeting arranged
by -the College Republicans,
Wilson emphasized that he was
giving only his ‘‘first impres-
sions’”’ which were ‘‘subject to
revision and change’”’ but which
nevertheless ‘‘worried”’ him.

“It’s a curious artificial
social environment that the
fraternity social system
creates,”’ Wilson said. ‘‘There’s
a certain curious false streak
that’s at work there that I’d
don’t fully understand, but I
can’t think it’s healthy.’’

Wilson said he was drawn to
wonder about the social setup
here because. the students
wonder about it themselves.
“You worry that the only kind
of social relationship that you
seem to be able to have with
young women is when you are
gathered together rather en
masse over a beer — not one,
but several — in a kind but in-
tensive environment than a
casual being,’’ Wilson said.

He continued, “I sense that
there’s a certain artificiality to
the social life that is defined by
the Wednesday night-Friday
night-Saturday night staccato
life here....1 think some of you
even wonder whether you aren’t
misled in your social relation-

‘“‘When I meet the students at
Washington and Lee,” he said,
“I meet gentlemen, for the most
part....When I talk to students

badly treated in recent years
and it’s a terrible burden to
place on this generation of

because they’re still dragging
the reputation of the early
seventies along with them and it

ships.”

Wilson said _ that

said. -

“That’s the last thing you
would have thought of at a
single sex institution, that you’d
be inundated with young women
who purportedly want to meet
you. What else are they doing
here if they don’t want to do

that?”’

After talking to a number of
students at the women’s col-
leges, Wilson sees a contradic-
tion between their impression of

W&L and the image that he sees
it as projecting.

W&L
students suffer a sort of embar-
rassment of riches when it
comes to women. ‘‘You’re spoil-
ed, in a curious sort of way,” he

from Hollins and other schools,
they say it can be really very
rude, very gross, very crude....

“Part of it can be explained
by mob psychology, but I have a
hard time putting that together
with the men that I know there
on Wednesday night-Friday
night-Saturday night.”

Wilson said that the frater-
nities have a real problem with
image. “Our fraternities carry
a very substantial part of the
reputation of this institution,
and for the most part, although
I think the reputation the frater-
nities carry is out of date, it’s
negative...

“They don’t have a very good
reputation, mainly, I think,

will take a while to change that.
believe that the fraternities are
trying to improve and become
better.”

“T think the fraternities can
be a great force for good here,
or they can be a source of grave
impediment to us. We need
responsible social organiza-
tions,’’ he added.

Part of the fraternities’ pro-
blem is a physical one, accor-
ding to Wilson. ‘The frater-
nities are for the most part lodg-
ed in aging residences — aging
is the most charitable thing one
can say about some of them.”
He said many of them have
“deep structural problems.”’

“This generation of students
has inherited houses that were

responsible people — the terri-
ble cost of maintenance.”

Again, Wilson said, image is a
critical factor. “‘Having Sigma
Nu boarded up is a horrible
thing. I said to the national! peo-
ple at Sigma Nu, “We’re either
going to tear it down, or we’re
going to get it going again, and
have it become a good, respon-
sible fraternity.’ Right now it’s
just a horrible liability. It looks
like the lower Bronx down
there.”

Although overall he express-
ed hope for the Greek frater-
nities don’t deserve to survive.”

It’s not just the fraternities
that are a concern to Wilson. “‘I
worry a little about the non-
affiliated students as well,’ he

wagonload of gold (to them),
but insult or humiliate the peo-
ple and they will tell you to take
your gold and get out without
giving you a second thought.”
“They pay a great deal of atten-
tion,’ he concluded, ‘‘to
respect.”’ Rittenburg considers
the Hu Na incident of primary
importance because it reflects
misperceptions each country
shares about the other. He said
it would be tragic for American
officials to incorrectly believe
they could bully China political-
ly simply because China needs
America’s unrequited aid.
Thus, an issue such as Hu Na’s
became part of what Rittenburg
feels is nothing more than “‘par-

Coed cénsidered 5—~

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

The inevitable surfaced. The
question was asked. What does
John D. Wilson, the new presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University, think about W&L
going co-educational?

“T don’t intend to go to the
May Board (of Trustees)
meeting with a coed proposal.”

What does citizen John D.
Wilson think about the prospect
of W&L with women as four-
year students?

That answer is not as clear.
Wilson readily admits to seeing
many “pro’s” in favor of going
coed, but he also concedes there
are many “‘cons.”’

ePro: “The role of women (in
society) has changed. When my
college at Oxford (Wilson was a
Rhodes Scholar) admitted
women in 1975, I knew the world
had changed.”

ePro: “Schools which were
once all-male have seen moral
reasons to change. Society has
changed; there is no
discrimination on the basis of
gender.”

ePro: ‘‘W&L strives to
educate the nation’s leaders,
whether they be men or women,
Bob Doles or Elizabeth Doles.”’

ePro: “Women, a Princeton
study (at a time when it was
considering coeducation)
found, were viewed as nice
entertainment for the group
from Friday noon to Sunday
evening. I don’t know if that
same situation exists here or
not.” (Pres. Wilson, it does ex-
ist here with the exception that
we also like them on Wed.even-
ings.)

ePro: “Excluding the two
military schools — VMI and the
Citadel, which have a stake in
the severity of life — the other
three schools (Hampden-
Sydney, Wabash, and W&L)
want to offer choice. But how

realistic is that argument? How
many students choose the
school on the basis of being all-
male? Admissions says it loses
many prospective students
because it is all-male. I heard
two freshmen in this class did
not know W&L was all-male un-
til they got here for orienta-
tion.”’

eCon: ‘It may be tradition,
standards, understanding (that
make this university special).
How coeducation would change
it and what it will change in this
university, I donot know.”

eCon: The fraternities would
be hurt by coeducation. “‘Some
fraternities don’t deserve to
survive.”

eCon: ‘Alumni giving might

go down.” ‘Where woiild
women be housed?”’
eCon: ‘‘There are the

peripheral issues, like athletics
and entitlements under Title IX
and having to hire medical
authorities suited to women’s
needs.”’

eIn short, “I think we need to
talk about this one over the next
few years.”

He took a stand, albeit un-
popular. He made his opinion as
clearly understood as could be
expected.

There can be no doubt in any
student’s mind where Pres.
Wilson stands on coeducation.
As a scholar sincerely in-
terested in the welfare of a fine
academic university, a
businessman wary of the declin-
ing numbers of college-bound
students, and an egalitarian
with a keen sensitivity to the
potential contribution of women
in the intellectual realm, Wilson
favors coeducation. As presi-
dent of a university proud of its
all-male heritage, he is no
iconoclast and seeks no im-
mediate fame as one.

May the rumors cease and
serious discussion begin anew
on this issue.

Student input explained

To the Editor,

In regard to Bruce Potter’s
editorial in the Ring-tum Phi of
April 21 (Faculty Moves
Without Input), I wholehearted-
ly agree with the basic premise
— that there should be student
input on major policy changes
but I must take exception to the
conclusion that student par-
ticipation in the decision-
making process is not currently
provided for in the governing
structures of the university. I
am therefore writing in an ef-
fort to set the record straight
and to clear up some obvious
misunderstandings apparent in
that editorial.

First as to the avenues now
available for student input on
major policy decisions within
the university. As emphasized
by Bennett Ross in last week’s
Executive Committee meeting,
the President of the Student
Body does meet with the Board
of Trustees and for all practical
purposes fulfills the role urged
by the Phi’s editorial writer,
that of a non-voting student
member.

Thirteen students are elected
to membership on the Universi-
ty Council which, among its
other functions, serves as a
forum to ‘‘discuss and debate
university business, providing
an advisory group represen-
tative of the university com-
munity.” All major issues and
proposals for policy changes
are discussed in the University
council prior to final determina-
tion and action. The Council’s
monthly meetings are open to
the Phi and to the student body,
with notice of the dates and
times of meetings prominently
publicized on campus.

In addition to the Council
members, there are also two
student representatives on the
Committee on Courses and
Degrees, two on the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee, and five on
the Student Affairs Committee.

These students serve as student
body representatives on these
committees and _ provide
another means for the expres-
sion of student ideas and opi-
nions on important issues.

The two specific examples
cited by Mr. Potter to
demonstrate faculty actions
“without input’ are the addi-
tion of pluses and minuses to
our grading system and the new
general education re-
quirements. Here are the facts.
Changes in the grading system
were considered several years
ago without resolution. The
matter was discussed again on
April 20, 1982 by the Committee
on Coursee and Degrees and by
the University Council on April
29: both students and faculty
present at the Council meeting
expressed general approval of
the proposal. On May 3, 1982,
the faculty voted to add pluses
and minuses to the letter
grades, effective Sept. 1983 and
applicable to all students.

In regard to the general
education requirements,
University Council members
received copies of the Report of
the Committee on General
Education on April 29, 1982.
Last fall the University Council,
as well as the Student Body Ex-
ecutive Committee, again
received copies. The Council
held a lengthy discussion of the
report at its meeting on Oct. 29
and voted (9-8) to recommend
to the faculty the deletion of the
proposed foreign language re-
quirement. Neither students
nor faculty were unanimous in
this recommendation, which
was conveyed to the faculty at
its Movember meeting. The
faculty took no action on the
matter until March 29, 1983
(allowing additional time for
expression of student opinion),
when it voted to accept the new
requirements. Perhaps the ob-
jection is not so much the lack
of opportunity for student opi-
nion to be heard, but that the

faculty did not vote the way
some students urged.

The lesson that emerges from
these examples, it seems to me,
is that opportunities for the ex-
pression of student opinions and
ideas do in fact exist at
Washington and Lee now. If
that is the case, the crucial
question then becomes whether
or not students are taking full
advantage of these opportuni-
ties. The challenge is to do just
that.

Dean Lewis John

Pompous Pyle

To the Editor,

Weare sorry to report that we
have stumbled across (stepped
in, rather) Markham Pyle’s re-
cent column on Central
America (‘Banana Manana,”
April 21, 1983) which starts off
with ruminations about rural
life in his Texas home and ends
by suggesting that the sanction-
ing of political genocide by El
Salvador’s ‘legal system’’ is,
as a quaint foreign custom,
beyond criticism.

We are tempted to say that
Mr. Pyle’s offering is a
despicable exercise in pompous
doubletalk serving a morally
reprehensible position, but who
are we to say? After all, Mr.
Pyle’s rationale may be to ra-
tional discourse as Salvadoran
justice is to our limited vision of
it — just a different way of do-
ing things.

We are glad, though, that Mr.
Pyle likes the fact that there is
room in the “ideology” and
‘consciences’ of rightist
regimes in Central America for
“‘repentence.’’ We hope the
same thing holds true for his
own.

Sincerely,

Dean Watt takes leave, goes to Oxford

William J. Watt, dean of the
College at Washington and Lee
University since 1971, has an-
nounced his intention to resign
from that position at the end of
the 1983-84 academic year.

Dr. Watt will return to full-
time teaching as professor of
chemistry in the fall of 1985. He
will spend the 1984-85 academic
year studying at Oxford Univer-
sity in England while on leave
of absence from W&L.

The announcement of Watt’s
decision was made by Wash-
ington and Lee President John
D. Wilson. In notifying the
faculty of Watt’s intention,
Wilson praised Watt’s contribu-
tions to the university.

“T can testify to the universal
respect (Dean Watt) has earned

for himself, the College (W&L’s
arts and sciences division), and
the university in his work away
from Lexington — in the Com-
monwealth to be sure, but in na-
tional and foreign settings as
well.... We owe him more than
we can ever repay,” Wilson
said.

Wilson announced the forma-
tion of a nine-member dean’s
search committee to seck
Watt’s successor and noted that
the committee will conduct a
national search in order “to
seek the best possible. appoint-
ment for this vital position.”

A member of the Washington
and Lee faculty since 1955, Watt
was named assistant dean of
the College in 1966. Two years
later he was named associate

dean.

During his deanship, Watt has
been a member of several im-
portant national and regional
organizations. In July he will
preside as chairman over the
annual meeting of the National
Dean’s Conference in Still-
water, Okla. He is former presi-
dent of the Conference of Aca-
demic Deans of the Southern
States and has been an active
participant in the American
Association of Higher Educa-
tion conferences.

Watt is a native of Carbon-
dale, Ill. He received his bache-
lor’s degree in chemistry from
the University of Illinois and his
master’s and doctorate from
Cornell.

He taught at Cornell and at

Barritt prepares for President
Wilson’s inauguration

When he was appointed Wash-
ington and Lee’s university
marshal eight years ago, C.
Westbrook Barritt had no idea
what would be in store for him
this spring.

As the university marshal
and chairman of the public
functions committee, Barritt
has been charged with the task
of making certain the inaugura-
tion of W&L President John D.
Wilson goes off without a hitch
on May 19.

For the past four months Bar-
ritt, who is head of the romance
languages department and has
taught Spanish at W&L since
1952, has spent hours upon
hours poring over invitation
lists and coordinating hotel ar-
rangments and arranging for
extra parking spaces at neigh-
boring VMI and searching for
an outdoor orchestra shell and
worrying about whether the
weather will cooperate and ...
well, you get the picture.

“Once I finish with this in-
auguration I may hire myself
out to other colleges as an in-
auguration consultant — and
throw in a graduation or two for
good measure,” said Barritt,
smiling from behind a desk pil-
ed high with correspondence
and memos about the inaugura-
tion.

Wilson is the 21st president of
Washington and Lee. His in-
auguration will be held at 3 p.m.
on May 19 in front of Lee Chapel
with Thomas A. Bartlett,
chancellor of the University of
Alabama System presenting the
inaugural address. The public is
invited to attend the ceremony.

The last inauguration at W&L
was in 1968 when Robert E.R.
Huntley became president. Bar-
ritt has relied heavily on notes
that were left from the planning
of that inauguration.

“Leon Sensabaugh (retired
professor of history) was the
chairman at that point and
made excellent notes,”’ Barritt

said. “We are following the pro-
cedures done then to some ex-
tent, but there are differences
simply because of the scope of
the inauguration. President
Wilson wants to keep it as un-
complicated as possible.”

That, of course, is easier said
than done.

“One of the traditions of a col-
lege inauguration is that presi-
dents of other colleges are in-
vited to attend,’’ noted Barritt.
“In this instance we have
limited our invitations to other
colleges to include all the four-
year institutions in Virginia,
those colleges that are older
than Washington and Lee, and
then a group of colleges with
which we or Dr. Wilson have
some special association.”

All told, the presidents (or
their appointed represen-
tatives) of about 50 colleges and
universities will be in attend-
ance as will representatives of
10 learned societies and educa-
tional organizations.

When one of the invited guests
accepts the university’s invita-
tion to attend, Barritt must
make certain that hotel ac-
comodations are available for
those who require such ar-
rangements.

Then there is the task of get-
ting all the principals in the in-
augural procession — in the
proper order and on time.

“That part of the job is: not
that much different from what I

- am required to do each year for

our commencement exercises,
which had been my primary re-
sponsibility as university mar-
shal — until now, that is,” Bar-
ritt said.

The details are endless. Extra
parking for all the guests must
be found. Academic robes must
be ordered for those partici-
pants who require them. The
programs must be composed
and printed: The seating ar-
rangements must be coor-
dinated with buildings and
grounds superintendent Jim Ar-
thur. Music by the W&L Brass
and Percussion Ensemble and
the university’s Glee Club must
be arranged. The out-of-town
visitors must be given a place to
register and instructions on
where to be and when to be
there. Then there are the
flowers, and security and alter-
nate sites in the event of incle-
ment weather — ah, yes, the
weather.

“The weather is perhaps my
biggest worry,” said Barritt.
“There is the chance that it will
rain and force us to move in-
doors. And there is the chance
that the heat will be unbearable
at 3 o’clock on a mid-May after-
noon.”

That is one detail over which
Barritt has no control. Not even
a university marshal armed
with the university’s rather im-
posing mace has power over the
highs and lows and jet streams.

Forest Service offers summer jobs

If you can sacrifice salary for
a chance to gain valuable work
experience this summer, the
U.S. Department of Agri
culture’s Forest Service has a
program just for you.

It’s called the Volunteers in
the National Forests and the
program is gaining popularity
among college students who are
looking for meaningful ways to
spend their summers.

“Sure I was skeptical about
not getting a paycheck, but I
took a gamble and it paid off,”’
said Paul Leadabrand who
served as a_ volunteer
wilderness ranger in Colorado’s
magnificent Eagles Nest
Wilderness. ‘‘I was majoring in
forestry production at Hum-
boldt State College in Arcata,
Calif., and I saw the volunteer
program as a good opportunity
to get some real experience.
Even though I didn’t earn much
money, it turned out to be a
very worthwhile summer.”’

While serving as a volunteer,
Leadabrand completed a study
on the impact of four-wheel-
drive vehicles on the
wilderness. His work was so
well received that after he
graduated, the Forest Service
hired him on a permanent basis
to supervise the use of off-road
vehicles in the wilderness.

The snow-capped peaks of the
Eagles Nest also provided
valuable experience for Diane
Nelson of Galva, Ill.

“I saw the Volunteer Pro-
gram as an opportunity to gain
experience and to do something
different,” she said. ‘‘Instead of
working in the heat of Illinois, I
spent my summer maintaining
trails and patrolling campsites
in mountainous areas that were
often more than 12,000 feet high
and snow covered.”’

Nelson also said the ex-
perience she gained as a
volunteer was helpful in com-
pleting her studies in recreation

and parks administration at II-
linois State University.

“Last year alone, more than
42,000 volunteers contributed
work to the Forest Service
valued at $15 million,” said Stan
Gaylord, the Forest Service’s
national volunteer coordinator.
“In return, we gave them a
chance to gain valuable ex-
perience and to expand their
horizons. We also provided in-
surance coverage and often
reimbursed them for incidental
expenses.”’

Gaylord explained that the
Forest Service makes every ef-
fort to place volunteers in iohs
that are both interesting and
related to the volunteers’ in-
terests or career goals.

For instance, most people
don’t associate the Forest Ser-
vice with computers. But many
volunteers are finding the agen-
cy to be an excellent place to
gain experience with the latest
data processing equipment.

‘As far as I’m concerned, be-
ing a Forest Service volunteer
is definitely a good ex-
perience,” said Debbie Irvine, a
19-year old computer sciences
major at Lassen College in
Susanville, Calif. As a volunteer
working in the supervisor’s of-
fice of the nearby Lassen Na-
tional Forest, she spends
several hours each day entering
Forest Service data into the
agency’s computers. ‘‘Because
I live only a few minutes away
from the office, volunteering is
almost like having all this
sophisticated equipment in my
own home. Without the
volunteer program, I would
never have had the opportunity
to gain as much experience as I
am getting now.”’

Journalism students also find
the Volunteer Program to a

‘good source of valuable ex-

perience.

variety of information jobs, but
the many different kinds of peo-
ple who came to the office to ask
questions about the Forest Ser-
vice increased my understand-
ing of the wide variety of au-
diences the agency serves. I
find that experience to be par-
ticularly useful in my current
job as a newspaper reporter.”’

Barbera Merlin, a student at
San Francisco State, is current-
ly working as a volunteer in the
Forest Service’s regional infor-
mation office in San Francisco.
The program has been so well-
received that San Francisco
State students who volunteer
receive credit toward gradua-
tion. Among her other volunteer
duties, Merlin is putting
together a discussion panel to
recruit more volunteers.

Some of the more traditional
natural resource professions

associated with the Forest Ser-
vice, such as timber, wildlife,
and recreation management,
are notorious for the difficulties
they pose for students who want
| to gain experience in them. The
volunteer program helps
eliminate these difficulties,

“Volunteering provided me
with my first real field ex-
perience,” said Bob Willging, a
wildlife management and
biology major at the University
of Wisconsin. ‘‘Last summer, I
spent five valuable weeks as a
volunteer wildlife management
assistant on the Chequamegon
National Forest in Wisconsin.
I’m sure that experience will
make my resume look more at-
tractive to prospective
employers after I graduate.”’

The Volunteers in the Na-
tional Forest program has even
become international in scope.
Last year, Thomas Wurth, in
forestry at the University of
Freiburg in West Germany,
volunteered to help out on the
Klamath National Forest in
California.

The Volunteers in the Na-
tional Forest program is not
limited to college students.
High school students may also
participate, although permis-
sion must be obtained from
parents if the students are
under the age of 18.

Three times each week, high
school students Mark Swenson
and Denise Bishop spend two
hours after school working as
volunteers in the supervisor’s
office for the Sequoia National
Forest in Placerville, Calif. As
volunteers, Mark enters data
into a computer and Denise
works in the information office.

There are Forest Service of-
fices in 44 states, the Virgin
Islands, and Puerto Rico. To
sign up as a volunteer, contact
one of these offices listed in teh
phone book under ‘“U:S.
Government, Department of
Agriculture,’’ or write:
Volunteers, Forest Ser-
vice,USDA, Box 37483,
Washington, D.C. 20013. The on-
ly qualifications needed by
volunteers are good health and
a willingness to work.

 

Wilson

(continued from page 1)

said. “35% of us are not
members of fraternities and
I’m not sure what kind of social
or co-curricular or extra-
curricular life the university
helps to provide for students
who haven’t decided to go that
way.”

Also, Wilson said, he’s ‘‘a lit-
tle worried about our
quintessentially residential uni-
versity, and yet we scatter ina
rather quick fashion...

‘“‘While I don’t blame you for
not driving in from Glasgow,”
Wilson said, ‘‘I’ve been embar-
rassed to go to a basketball
game and find 25 or 30 students
there, for example, most of
them freshmen, because they
were able to come across from
the residence hall without in-
vesting a lot of time in it.’’

He said ‘‘you tend to get in for
the things you most want to do,
but I don’t think it’s as easy as it
ordinarily is to be part of a
stimulating university environ-
ment.”

The same problem affects the
fraternities, he said. ‘‘We have
this curious social pattern
where the houses are mainly oc-
cupied by sophomores....
Juniors and seniors abandon
the houses.”’

“Some of the places the
juniors and seniors live sound
really idyllic, and I’m sure that
a certain kind of decent lifestyle
can be created out there, but it
doesn’t create a university com-
munity. It’s hard to come back
at night.”

In the area of the curriculum,
Wilson said that the University
is going to ‘‘rethink’’ the direc-
tion of the Engineering depart-
ment. They also will be seeing
“whether we want to do more
with” computer science.

In addition, Wilson said that
although the University has a
number of very strong foreign
study programs, Russian
studies and the Soviet Union
have been ‘‘neglected,’’ even
though that field is ‘‘important
to America’s future’ and has
‘‘an intellectual richness.”’

Wilson’ invited student

response to the concerns he ex-
pressed. “I don’t need some
help on all of these things...I
really would welcome your
communication on them, either
by stopping in or by writing to
me.”’

Wilson has also been pleased
to meet his faculty colleagues,
and says he’s been impressed
by their ‘‘competence,’’
“decency,” and “stature as
human beings.’’

He drew laughs with the
remark that “‘there’s no point in
a9 to1 ratioif the company isn’t
very good.”

The president also com-
plimented the student body,
although cautiously. He said he
was “risking the terrible error
of flattering the young. I think
it’s the worst make young peo-
ple think better of themselves.”

He spoke again later of ‘‘the
danger of spoiling the young,”
saying facetiously, ‘I don’t
think you’re all that damn good,
but you’re not bad.”

At the outset of his speech,
Wilson said, “I’m really truly

talking about first impressions
of a University that after all is
235 years old or more and has
many, many deep currents run-
ning through it.

“I don’t for a moment sup-
pose that I have a feel for all of
those or that I truly understand
Washington and Lee and its peo-
ple and its past and its strengths
and its weaknesses. I have only
the most tentative impres-
sions....All of these impressions
are subject to revision and
change as I learn more about
you.”

Wilson said “there are many,

many things I’ve come to ad-
mire about Washington and Lee
in these first few months.”’ One
of those is that “‘it isn’t embar-
rassed to have ideals.”’

“I think the idea of the
gentleman scholar went
through an awful period of buf-
fetting in the late sixties and
early seventies and was scoffed
at by the deep cynicism that
entered our society at that time,
but I think it’s still alive — it
may flicker from time to time,
but it’s still alive here,”’ he said.

He also likes that “‘it’s an old
and venerable place.’ He said,
“T’ll be frank to tell you I haye
yet to walk down that Collonade
without feeling a certain sense
of genuine privilege that I’m
walking along a walkway that
has been traversed by so many
men of the first rank.’’

Another plus for W&L is its
physical environment, Wilson
told the students. ‘‘Lexington is
an interesting physical campus,
I think. It is not New York.
Some of us say, ‘Thank
God....’ I quite like life here.”’
“Blood Feud’s’’

Though his closest friends
would never recognize him,
Washington and Lee University
journalism professor Clark
Mollenhoff will be spending a
lot of time on national television
during the next two weeks.

Twenty-five years ago Mol-
lenhoff won a Pulitzer Prize for
his investigative reports on
labor racketeering in general
and Teamster boss Jimmy Hof-
fain particular.

Earlier this month a televi-
sion docu-drama chronicling
the investigation and trials of
Hoffa was released in major
markets throughout the United
States. Entitled ‘‘Blood Feud,”’
the program features a charac-
ter by the name of Clark Mol-
lenhoff, an aggressive reporter
for the Des Moines Register and
Tribune and the Minneapolis
Star and Tribune.

The Mollenhoff character is
played by actor Douglas Dirk-
sen who is less than 6 feet tall,
balding, mustachioed, and soft-
spoken (compared to Mollen-
hoff’s resounding bass, at
least).

“I recognize the words that
are spoken, but the Mollenhoff
in “Blood Feud”’ doesn’t look or
sound a bit like I do — or did
back then,” Says Mollenhoff.

Lexington-area cable TV
viewers will get an opportunity
to see for themselves on May 11
when WDCA-TV in Washington
(Channel 12 on the Lexington
Cable System) airs the four-
hour program which was pro-
duced by Operation Prime
Time and is being shown on
more than 8:0 stations
throughout the country.

Aside from the obvious
physical differences between
himself and the character who
portrays him, Mollenhoff feels
“Blood Feud”’ represents a fair-
ly accurate version of the
episode.

“‘T read the original script and
have seen some clips from the
movie,” noted Mollenhoff, ‘‘and
from what I have seen and read
it is fairly accurate. There are
obvious instances of taking
poetic license in the film. For
example, I am shown talking
with Hoffa at the prison after

his conviction. That conversa-
tion actually took place in the
courtroom.

“‘But many of the exchanges
are literally taken from my ac-
counts and other accounts of the
investigation and trials. There
may have been a few instances
in which the producers of the
film were overreaching in order
to heighten the drama.”’

Mollenhoff said he was not
surprised that members of
Robert Kennedy’s family are
unhappy with the way Kennedy
is portrayed in the film, which
centers on the decade-long con-
frontation between Hoffa and
Kennedy, who was chief counsel
to the McClellan Committee
and later U.S. attorney general
and senator from New York.

“I would expect the Kennedys
would not like what they saw on
the screen,’”’ Mollenhoff said.
“The words and the mood of
Bobby Kennedy in the film were
both aggressive — at times
overly aggressive. But he could
not have done his job well had
he always held back.”

Mollenhoff has been a mem-
ber of the Washington and Lee
faculty since 1976 but still keeps
in touch with his old capital beat
by writing for the Washington
Times.

inority recruiting at W&L:

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

[Editors Note: This is the first
of a series on black students at
Washington and Lee.]

“lf we are ever going to
understand each other, we are
going to have to study together
and be educated together.
There isn’t this opportunity
really now at W&L for either the
black or white man; so diversi-
ty, racially, is extremely impor-
tant.”

From an interview by the Ring-
tum Phi

with James D. Farrar, director
of

admissions at W&L, Dec. 5,
1969.

"We need to come to some
fuller understanding of the
black experience in the United

States.’’
John D. Wilson, President
W&L, April 27, 1983

In 16 years since the first
black applicant to Washington
and Lee University was admit-
ted, school officials have pledg-
ed a commitment to meaningful
integration.

But the black community at
W&L remains only a nominal
group. Since 1966, only 93 black
students have matriculated and
39 have graduated from the
undergraduate school. Today
there are 24 blacks on a campus
of about 1300, taught by an all-
white faculty.

And the numbers show no
sign of increasing. Although the
number of blacks applying has
increased in the past three
years, the number enrolling has
_ remained at a consistently low
level.

“Looking at the stastistics,
we’re not doing that well,’’ said
John White, director of minori-
ty affairs. ‘‘But we're doing all
that a small college can do.”’

Now minority recruitment at
W&L and other private institu-
tions in the state faces an uncer-
tain future.

Virginia public colleges and
universities have received a
mandate from a federal judge
to increase enrollment of black

freshmen and transfers in 1985
by about 20 percent, or face a
cut in federal funds. (See
related story. )

Competition for qualified
black students will become
unusually keen.

Among private schools,
W&L’s dilemma is not unique.
Only a very few four-year
private institutions in Virginia
can claim a minority enroll-
ment above five percent.

The problem is not a lack of
enthusiasm on the part of the
administration or admissions
staff at W&L.

“We are making a good-faith
effort toward affirmative ac-
tion,” said Van Pate, associate
director of admissions.

Between 2,000 and 2,500 black
high school seniors receive in-
formation from W&L each
year; and a combination of
financial aid, grants and
scholarships give W&L ‘‘one of
the most attractive recruitment
policies of any small college,’
White said.

Yet the percentage of minori-
ty students enrolling from the
numbers applying is only 34
percent. Black students are
simply not attracted toW&L.

“They’re just not biting,”
White said.

Problems

Admissions officals at W&L
and VMI have identified several
problems that they believe
hinder efforts to recruit black
students:

ePerception

W&L was one of the last
schools in the country to in-
tegrate; and its links to the
traditions of the Old South have
created a considerable image
problem among blacks.

While W&L enjoys con-
siderable respect by middle-
and upper class white circles, it
does not have a good reputation
among blacks.

“Historically we’ve got to
fight a misapprehension on the
part of the black community.
We have to convince them that
we are sincere,”’ White said.

The school’s location adds to
that apprehension. Most black
students are recruited from ur-

ban areas and are not generally

- attracted toa rural campus.

Moreover, many are concern-
ed about coming to a college
where blacks are few in number
on campus and in the communi-

ty.

“T think they are put off when
they come into a community
where they don’t join black pro-
fessionals,’’ Wilson said. ‘“This
side of the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains, there is not a black com-
munity to join.”

White also believes location is
a problem. ‘‘A lot of parents are
skeptical about sending their
sons to a_ predominatingly
white, all-male college in
Southwest Virginia ;” he said.

Competition

W&L is in head-to-head com-
petition for top black high
school seniors with some of the
best schools in the country,
many of which can offer full tui-
tion or scholarships for minori-
ty students.

As a private university, the
cost of coming to W&L prevents
serious consideration by poor
families, black and_ white,
despite liberal financial aid pro-
grams.

Many promising black can-
didates have been lured away
by the service academies as
well. White remembers more
than one student committed to
W&L who has backed out after
being accepted at the US.
Naval Academy.

*A small pool
Col. William J. Buchanan,
of admissions at
Virginia Military Institute, sees
another problem existing at the
secondary school level.

He said not enough blacks are

taking college preparatory
courses in high school to qualify

them for admission at schools
such as VMI and W&L. Only 33
percent of all males, white and
black, take any college prep
courses, he said.

To counteract that, VMI has
undertaken ‘‘project _transi-
tion,” in which minority high
school students are brought to
summer school at VMI without
charge “to pump up their
backgrounds,”’ In addition, VMI
can offer full athletic scholar-
ships to qualified blacks.

Approximately 4.6 percent of
VMI’s student body is black.

°No Women

W&L is crippled by its all-
male status, primarily because
the school cannot recruit black
women.

“Fifty-one percent of the
population goes right there,”
White said.

It also limits the social oppor-
tunities W&L can offer to black
students. The black com-
munities at the surrounding
women’s colleges are as small
as W&L’s.

“The social life at W&L for
minority students sux,’ said

Terry McWhorter, a_ black
sophomore from Cleveland,
Ohio.

No blacks are members of
fraternities and they have to
make a special effort on the
weekends, he said.

White said most blacks are
used to coeducation and may be
frightened away by the pro-
spects of an all-male college.

“Several students, otherwise
convinced to attend W&L for
academic and financial aid con-
siderations, are deterred by

   
 

eam

personal anxiety about social ~
survival in an all-male environ-
ment,” White said.

The Recruiting Pro-
gram

To combat those and other
obstacles, W&L has developed a
program to attract qualified
black students.

The process begins with a
mail campaign to high school
seniors identified through the
SAT student search.

White, who was hired in 1979
specifically to recruit and
counsel minority students,
travels about two weeks a year
to black high schools all over
the country, trying to convince

Black alumni assist in the

black alumni group in Atlanta;
and Matthew Towns, ’74, vice
president of Wachovia Bank in
Winston-Salem, N.C., has per-
sonally contacted every black
applicant for the past three
years.

Despite that kind of effort,
W&L continues to have trouble
enticing minority students.

“T go into places like Harlem,
D.C. and Dallas,’’ White said
‘‘And I’ve had students tell me,
‘I like what I see, but I don’t
think I can make it.’ ...We’re do-
ing the best we can.”

OCR Review

W&L’s performance in

recruiting minority students is

under routine review by the Of-
fice of Civil Rights in the U.S.
Department of Education.
According to Ron Gilliam,
deputy director of the OCR
regional office in Philadelphia,
the office is required to do
periodic reviews of schools
receiving federal money.

Nevertheless, it will be the
first time W&L’s_ minority
policy has come under the
scrutiny of an outside agency.

W&L receives substantial
federal funds especially for
financial aid; under Title VI,
federal money must be used
without discrimination to race,
religion or sex. W&L is exempt
from the sex clause.

‘Frankly, I’m surprised the
OCR review has not come up.
sooner,”’ Pate said.

Pate said the OCR review is
equivalent to audits of the finan-
cial aid books conducted each
year by the federal government
to ensure that federal funds are
being dispensed properly.

The OCR wants to be sure
that W&L is doing everything it

 
   

can to recruit minority
students, he said.

An unfavorable review could
result in an ultimatum to im-
prove the recruiting process or
lose federal money.

One possible area for im-
provement is in the faculty.
There are no black faculty
members on the undergraduate
campus.

‘‘We’re going to keep our eyes
open for black faculty, ad-
ministration and staff,’’ Wilson
said. ‘That will help attract
black students.”

Black faculty also would help
with the students already here.

“It would be helpful if minori-
ty students had a few more role
models here,’’ White said’

University officials, however,
are confident that they are do-

ing as much as they can.

Gilliam said representatives
from OCR will be on campus
this month for interviews with
administration, faculty and
students.

State colleges face new quotas

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

Efforts at Washington and
Lee University to recruit
minority students may be com-
plicated in the next few years as
State-supported colleges and
universities scramble to meet
quotas established under a new
Virginia desegregation plan.

Virginia is under fire from
U.S. District Judge John H.
Pratt, who has threatened to cut
$100 million in federal funds
unless state schools can
demonstrate some improve-
ment in enrolling black and
other minortiy students.-

In January, Gov. Charles S.
Robb signed the new plan which
includes:

eAdjusted numerical goals
for enrollment of minority
students.

°A faculty exchange program
between black and white col-
leges.

°$1,000 scholarships for
qualified community college
students who transfer to
predominatly ‘‘other race’’ in-
stitutions.

The 3-year plan will cost
about $16 million, according to
The Washington Post.

The historically white institu-
tions must increase their enroll-
ment of black freshmen and
transfers by an average of 20
percent by next fall.

Many schools are taking ex-
traordinary steps to prove their
sincerity in recruiting blacks.
The University of Virginia, The
College of William and Mary
and George Mason University
have announced they will take
applications from blacks until
school opens in the fall.

And several institutions are
taking part in a state-funded
airplane tour of Virginia com-
munity college campuses
scheduled for today.

At Virginia Military Institute,
however, the problem is not as
severe, according to Col.
William J. Buchanan, director
of admissions. VMI’s goal has
been set at 16 black Virginians
for next year’s freshmen class
of about 400. Last year 14
entered the all-male public in-
stitute in Lexington.

“At least we have a fighting
chance,” Buchanan said.

Nevertheless, VMI is_ in-
stituting new measures to draw
more black students.

This summer, VMI will hold
its first “project transition.’
High school students will be
able to attend VMI summer
school at no cost and take col-
lege preparatory courses need-
ed to gain admission to VMI and
other institutions.

In addition, Buchanan will be
traveling for eight days later
this month with admissions per-
sonnel from other Virginia
public colleges in a_ state-
coordinated car and van tour of
community college campuses to
talk to potential transfer
students. VMI is not par-
ticipating in the plane tour.

Buchanan is critical of the
new desegregation plan, which,
he said, does not address the
problem at its roots in the
secondary school system.

“We need time to get seventh-
and eight-graders into college
prep courses,”’ he said. Judge
Pratt is giving the schools 18
months to comply.

Buchanan said it is
unrealistic to expect a college to

increase its black enrollment
unless the pool is enlarged.
Currently, only 33 percent of all
males, black and white are tak-
ing college prep courses in high
school, he said.

The NAACP Legal Defense
Fund also has blasted the new
plan,

The fund is angry because the
goals set for freshmen enroll-
ment in 1985 are lower than the

' goals set for 1981.

The Washington Post reports
that the state should have

 

enrolled 5,754 black freshmen
under the old plan while the
Robb plan calls for 5,477 by
1985.

The NAACP Legal Defense
Fund originally brought suit in
1972 to integrate colleges and
universities in Virginia and
other states.

Virginia’s first desegregation
plan was instituted in 1978.

That plan fell far short of its
numerical goals and was
declared a failure by the federal
government last summer.

cancer after the age of 45 to 50
increases rapidly.

Over the next several years the
American Cancer Society will be
conducting more research into certain
lifestyles and exposures which could
increase cancer mortality.

So know the risks.

Don’t smoke.

Watch what you eat and drink.

Look for the warning signs of
cancer.

And retire not only with a gold
ticker.

But a healthy one, also.

Lexington video rule studied

by MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

The Lexington Planning Com-
mission is considering
regulating video game
machines within Lexington’s
historic district, which is essen-
tially the central business area.

Henry Ravenhorst, chairman
of the commission and a W&L
professor of engineering, says
that the panel is working on
“coming up with an ordinance
or an amendment to zoning or-
dinances that will provide for
game rooms.”

He says the city’s laws ‘‘at the
present time don’t permit game
rooms. At the time the or-
dinances were written, there
were no game rooms. We need
some sort of amendment to the
ordinances defining game
rooms and indicating where
they’re permitted.”

Ravenhorst says the city is
‘concerned with control.”’
Video games, he said,
‘‘sometimes attract large
groups of people, particularly
young people, some of whom
generate a lot of noise and other
activity that might not be com-
patible with our historic
district.”

One proposal the commission
is considering would permit a

tisan politics”. Rittenburg sup-
ported his idea by noting that of
the more than 1000 Chinese who
have applied for political
asylum in the recent years ‘‘on-
ly something like 13’ were
granted asylum, 50 turned
down, and the rest are still on
file. Rittenburg called the Hu
Na decision ‘‘a very special and
deliberate handling...”
Rittenburg’s warnings are
ominous. The continued failure
of foreign policy of the decision
makers to understand and ap-
preciate the Chinese people ‘“‘is
getting us into trouble and may
get us into further trouble’.

 

 

 

business to have up to three
video games. If it had any more
than that, it would be con-
sidered a “game room’ and
would have to be licensed as
such.

In that case, Ravenhorst said,
if an establishment sold food
and also had four or more coin-
operated games, ‘‘the operator
may have to decide if it’s going
to be a restaurant or a game
room.”

One of the establishments
that would be affected by the
regulations is Lloyd’s of Lex-
ington, a fast-food store several
blocks from campus which has
37 video games.

Lloyd Smith, the proprietor,
said that he was unaware that
video games were under study
by the city.

Ravenhorst said there was
“no particular reason’’ Smith
had not been consulted.
“Everything we do is public.”
He added that before any
regulation is proposed,
“everyone affected will be
notified. When we have
something positive to present,
we'll involve everybody.”’

He said, ‘‘we’re trying to pro-
mote business. We don’t want to
exclude any kind of business but
we don’t want some sort of ac-

tivity there that will be a detri-
ment to the downtown area.”

According to Ravenhorst, the
three machine limit is just one
of the options the commission is
discussing, although he said,
“We're sort of feeling that
would be the logical thing to
do.”

The regulation would affect
only the downtown, or
“historic” district, which is
bounded by Randolph and Jef-
ferson streets and McDowell
and Henry streets.

Ravenhorst says the commis-
sion is currently studying how
other cities have handled the
problem. ‘Some cities have
quite voluminous regulations
that cover these things in great
detail,’ he said, citing Norfolk
and metropolitan Washington
as examples.

Ravenhorst, who has been on
the Planning Commission for
about 15 years says the group
has had video games under
study for six months.

“‘We’re supposed to be alert to
some of the things that are
changing and happening,’ he
said. ‘‘We’ve had this game
room thing come up from time
to time and we thought it
behooved us to get these things
on the ordinances.”

The moral right vs. rights of the majority

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Phi Liberal-at-Large

The rights and liberties all
Americans hold dear are more
gravely threatened now than
ever before. This threat,
however, does not come from a
foreign source, but from within
the United States. The
members of the so-called moral
right or moral majority,
through restrictive legislation
or legislated morality, threaten
the liberties of all Americans.

In their zest to make America
moral again, these self-
righteous crusaders are at-
tempting to repress free
thought at its most important
and formative phase by censor-
ing and restricting books in
school libraries. In their at-
tempt to fight sexual depravity
they restrict access to abortion
and legislate ‘‘squeal laws.”
Television shows are protested
unseen, based solely on hear-
say, and rock albums are burn-
ed because they are the work of
the devil and encourage drug
abuse.

Theatre

The list could go on, but the
point is clear: the new moral

right, or ‘‘conservatism,”’’
sweeping the country is
threatening the  individual’s

right to make his own moral
decisions, think his own ideas,
or exchange his thoughts with
another person. The moral
right’s efforts here are the most
pronounced in their school
library book bannings. Books as
Diverse as The Communist
Manifesto and Slaughterhouse
Five have been banned as
“‘obscene’’ and  ‘“‘anti-
American.” And they say Mc-
Carthy is gone.

The people who banned books
from the Island Trees, N.Y.,
school library were not profes-
sional educators. In most towns
these crucial decisions about
what should be in libraries are
not made by professional
educators, but by common
citizens or political flunkies.
These amateurs, without con-
sulting the public, are able to
ban books for any arbitrary
whim, and the public is without
a means to appeal. This means

the students get only one view of
the world, the one the board of
education members approve of
and support. Dissenting or
unpleasant views are neglected.

Our forefathers knew that the
only way to arrive at the truth
was through a free exchange of
ideas, but the moral myrmidons
do not believe the common man
is capable of telling good from
evil. The preachers would
prefer to make that decision for
him.

The school child’s fragile,
growing mind is also threatened
by President Ron and the other
supporters of school prayer. No
matter how this issue is ap-
proached, no matter how
prayer is introduced to our
schoolhouses, it will violate
someone’s rights. The public
school is not the proper environ-
ment for religious indoctrina-
tion. It is up to a child’s family
and community to teach that
child right and wrong, as well
as who and what god is. No mat-
ter what efforts are made to
please the public, there will
always be one individual who

Department prepares

‘Midsummer Night’s Dream’

By NED RICHARDSON
Special to the Phi

‘“‘A Midsummer. Night’s
Dream” is being produced by
the Washington & Lee Theatre
Department May 20-25. The
play is the Spring project of the
Drama 139 class and could
prove to be the University
Theatre’s most enchanting and
ambitious dramatic event to
date. “It’s W&L high-tech
theatre,”’ according to junior
drama major Bob Ferguson.

Drama 139, better known as
Total Theatre, earns its name
because students must get in-
volved in all aspects of produc-
tion. The intention is that
students achieve a realistic in-

sight of the theatrical ex-
perience, beginning with audi-
tions and casting for roles, pro-
gressing into the stages of set
construction, lighting, special
effects, sound coordination, and
ultimately the performance
nights. A problem with the con-
cept for ‘‘A Midsummer Night’s
Dream”’ is that the technical
work planned requires much
time and patience.

The concept presented by
Tom Ziegler is constructivistic,
meaning that the set becomes
physical and can move pieces to
attain a completely different
visual effect. Ferguson, in
regard to the concept, says that
it is difficult, ‘‘but definitely
there.’”’ Although space is
limited in the Troubadour,
Ziegler’s plans are precise and

for the most part economical.
The set should prove to be as in-
teresting as director Al Gor-
don’s contemporary interpreta-
tion of Shakespeare’s classic.

Most of the play’s actors are
from the Total Theatre class;

many are newcomers to the
University Theatre. The cast
was chosen early last week
after much deliberation and
thorough auditioning. A prob-
lem here was that the expertise
needed in ‘cold readings’ left
any sure casting possibilities
impossible. Although some of
the larger roles have been filled
with experienced students,
Chris Cartmill as Oberon, Kate
Settle as Helena, Ted Petrides
as Bottom, Tom Murphy as
Starveling, the majority of
those cast are at it for the first

time. The play allows for this
because of the number of
smaller parts which are essen-
tial, and not over-burdened with
long, windy speeches. David
Marsh and Chris Carmouche
have both appeared in the
University. Theatre’s earlier
productions this year, and are
playing Flute and Egeus
respectively. Blake O’Neill is

playing Snyg, and like Bob
Bryant (Quince), Jim Farthing
(Philostrate), Kreg Kurtz
(Cobweb), and Joel James
(Lysander), O’Neill is a
newcomer to the W&L Theatre.

Steve Palmer is playing
Mustardseed, and though per-
forming for the first time, he
has. been involved with the

offered in the fall and winter.
Drew Perkins and Richard
Kopelman are splitting the role
of Puck to enhance the
character’s fantastical quality.
Perkins is a veteran last seen in
‘The Outcast’’, while
Kopelman commands W&L au-
dience s attention for the first
time.

Those cast outside of class in-
clude previously seen Chris Lil-
ja as Theseus, assistant pro-

fessor Paula Langdon who, in
her last term at W&L, plays
Titania as her swan-song, and a
host of girls from Lexington
High School. Among them is Sid
Ray, as Moth, who was involved
with props for the recent W&L
production of ‘‘Tea and Sym-
pathy.” Jennifer Wise, stage
manager for that same produc-
tion, joins the ensemble as Hip-
polyta, and the regional veteran
Andrea LaRue will play

Peaseblossom. Sarah Phimster -

will appear for the first time as
Hermia.

The technical work and ac-
ting responsibilities being
undertaken will be worth look-
ing into. W&L Theatre will out-
do itself within the confines of
the Troubadour Theatre. Well,
that’s what the enthusiastic
members of Total Theatre
know.

will be offended, and in a public
school that person’s rights can-
not be violated. By having
prayers in school there is an im-
plication that this god is cor-
rect, and this is the proper way
to pray and worship, and this in-
fringes on the individual’s right
to arrive at his own religious
beliefs. Anti-abortion legisla-
tion threatens to plunge us into
the dark ages of mob-run clinics
and coathangers. And, for those
who attempt to prevent the need
for an abortion: better be 18,
because if they have their way
they will tell your folks. Sup-
porters of ‘‘squeal laws’’ say
they will cause better com-
munication within families. It
will make families larger, if
nothing else. Attempts to in-
troduce legitimate, worthwhile
sex education are blocked,
because knowledge of such
things will result in the kids do-
ing it, as if they wouldn’t other-
wise. The moral radicals seem
to want to keep sex in the closet
or the middle ages because it is
wrong or dirty. Not only are
they living in the past, but they
are making a moral decision for
you: Sex is Wrong. They seem
to be saying: ‘Trust us, it is.
And if you do it anyway, we will
make ti as tough and dangerous
for you as we can.”’

The blindness’ and
recklessness with which they
attack this issue is shown by the
handling of a 12-year old rape
victim. Rather than permit a
desired abortion, the anti-
abortion people forced the girl
to give birth through lengthy
court battles. The girl was later
charged with child neglect.

_ Despite these obvious threats
to the individual’s right to think
and arrive at his own conclu-
sions and moral views, the
American public views the
moral extremists as little more
than an interesting diversion.
Yet they are a serious threat.
They do not say ‘‘We think you
are wrong,”’ they say, ‘‘You are
wrong,” and then try to buy a
law to make it wrong.

It is not a large or devoted
following that gives the
preachers their power, but the
tax-free dollars they get from
their TV-studio churches.
Through nation-wide mail and
media appeals the video
preachers like Oral Roberts and
Jerry Falwell are able to raise
millions, which they are able to
use as a potent political tool or
weapon. Also, because they are
sometimes able to mobilize
their followers successfully, the
moral rightists have been able
to influence elections because of
the general voter’s apathy.

Unless they are stopped soon,
the moral extremists threaten
to turn the United States into a

theocracy, with
religious/political leaders
deciding what is right or wrong

and dictating those decisions to
the public. Books considered by
the high priests to be indecent
or anti-American will be bann-
ed, discussions or ideas that are
unpleasant will be stifled, and
free thinking eliminated. By
utilizing their right to free
speech, and other rights, the
moral radicals would deprive
everybody else of those very
same rights.

 

 

East German to speak

in Lee chapel

Dr. Heidrun Schorcht, pro-
fessor of English at Jena
University in the German
Democratic Republic (East
Germany), will present two ijec-
tures at Washington and Lee
University on Monday and
Tuesday.

Schorcht’s Monday lecture is
entitled ‘‘Thirty Years of
Scoialist Development in the
German Democratic Republic:
Progress and Problems.”

Her lecture on Tuesday is en-
titled ‘German Democratic
Republic Women Writers Speak
Out on Emancipation.”’

Both lectures will be at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel and are open to
the public at no charge. The lec-
tures are being sponsored joint-
ly by the German department
and the University Lectures
Committee.

A native of Langenhain in the
Erfurt District of East Ger-
many, Schorcht studied at
Friedrich Schiller University

where she received both her un-

dergraduate and graduate
degrees. She received her doc-
torate from Jena University in
1982.

She has been spending the
current semester at Colby Col-
lege in Waterville, Maine, as
visiting professor of East Ger-
man literature and as a langu-
age teaching assistant. Her
visit to Lexington is in connec-
tion with the W&L German de-
partment’s new course devoted
to the German Democratic
Republic and its literature.

In her opening lecture Mon-
day, Schorcht will provide a
general introduction to the Ger-
man Democratic Republic,
“the other Germany.” In her
lecture on Tuesday, Schorcht
will comment on the remark-
able surge of talented women
writers in the German Demo-
cratic Republic and the position
of women in the GDR society.

Norm Lord, a Darwinist philosopher?

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

Coach Norm Lord jumped on
the DuPont Auditorium stage
Monday night, emptied a long
narrow box, and immediately
began marching in military
fashion around the stage with
the box’s sole content: a broken
two by four.

“I’m going to go with NFL’s
(Norman F. Lord’s) philosophy
tonight,” he began, his ‘‘big
stick’”’ leaning against the wall
behind him. “‘I’ll tell you what I
am and what makes me tick.”’

The fifty people in the mixed
crowd of professors, university
employees, and students sat
back in their seats, and the Lor-
dian philosophy burst forth.

“1’m a_ social Darwinist,”
Lord said, jumping to a new
topic. “I also made a statement
that I’m for women. I believe
that a man should be the boss of
the household — I'll decide
when we go to war — but she is
the one who decides which
cocktail party we go to.”

His wife, seated in the front
row, smiled and looked at her
husband.

“My beautiful wife. She’s
here. Let’s give her five,” Lord
shouted, beginning the clapping

so hard that a button popped off
his left sleeve and circled the
stage.

‘‘As youcan tell from the grey
hair and bald head, I’m from a
different time. I was raised in
the Depression, and we lived on
a farm. I had to get the milk out
to the lane early in the morning
so a truck could bring it to the
trains—regardless of the time,
the weather. It makes me tick-
ed today when a student comes
up to me and asks if we’re going
outside because it is raining. He
doesn’t want to get wet. I say,
“Well heck it’s raining. So?”

“I saw bulls and cows do it,
drakes and ducks, cocks and
hens, boars and sows, studs and
mares, boars — no, I already
mentioned them. Hey, I didn’t
have to be taught it. I already
knew it. Life was simpler,’’ he
lamented. ‘‘Now you know all
the problems. You have a
greater awareness, so
idealistic. You have all the opi-
nions presented to you.”’

Lord was quick to mention his
early involvement in politics
before the College Republican
group.

“I became involved with a
girl named Octavia. She had the
hots for me. Octavia was

stacked. She kept right after

 

 

me. In high school, we were
Chemistry lab partners — that
was when there were two people
to one lab. Nowadays, Dr. Shill-
ington probably has two labs to
ene student — and she was in
the Republican Party. They
were holding a mock election,

‘between Alf Landon and FDR.

Well, she kept me involved in
politics,” remarked Lord.

“Octavia was the first
(women’s) libber also. I took
her to the senior prom and she
went braless,’’ Lord said,
aghast. ‘‘A 36-32-24? Is that
right? I know what I meant!”’

Lord related another comical
story about women and politics.

“The election of 1964. I was
coming back from Houston by
train — there had been a storm.
There were some women
behind me, saying they were
voting for Johnson because
Goldwater was going to drop
nooo-clear bombs and then the
water would have radiation and
mothers would feed their babies
and the teeth of little children
would fall out. I ALMOST
VOMITED. WHAT A DAMNED
LIE. I felt like using the two-by-
four on those women,” said
Lord, evoking applause and
laughter from throughout the
audience.

maxell.

 

The Great Society and
“cradle-to-grave’”’ politics of
Lyndon Johnson encountered
Lord’s wrath. So did politics in
the pulpit. So did government
over-regulation. And govern-
ment waste. And the biased
“media.” William Buckley
would have died and gone to
heaven were he there.

And the Lord kept on talking.

“There are two kinds of
s.0.b.’s in the world. I’ll use
“s.o.b.”” instead of ‘son-of-a-
bitch,’ but you know what I
mean. Anyway, there are inten-
tional and unintentional s.o.b.’s.

’ An unintentional s.o.b. is the

guy who doesn’t lift the lid when
he urinates and dribbles on the
rim, unintentionally, and
doesn’t wipe it up. Think about
the poor guy who has to sit down
then. An intentional s.o.b. is the
guy who goes all over the rim on
purpose.”

Laughter.

“Back in the 1960’s, an inten-
tional s.o.b. named Madelyn
O’Hair came around and had
prayer taken out of the
classroom — If I had that two-
by-four — POW!” said Lord,
swinging the broken board with
the ease of a baseball bat.
“Religion has its place, but it
should never have left the

classroom. Every morning I get
up, and say, ‘This is the day
which the Lord hath made. Let
us rejoice and be glad in it,’ and
look in the mirror and say ‘let’s
go get those sons of bitches.’ ’’

One s.o.b. Lord would like to
attack is government waste.

“If I could just be dictator for
one year,” he began, only to be
stopped by laughter.”’ Hey, I’d
say where there are two of you,
one has to go. I’d turn them
around.’’ More laughter
sprang from the crowd.

“It’s like urinating in your
orange juice,’’ he continued, not
missing a beat, only to be slow-
ed by more laughter. ‘It’s
human sabotage. Government
is inefficient.”’

Lord also took his two-by-four
to labor, the economy, and pro-
ductivity.

“‘We cut our own throats. We
keep the same productivity and
raise wages and become un-
competitive. We make steel in-
gots, sell them to Japan, and
ship them back here. I’m guilty.
I bought a Volkswagen, but it’s
the better car. A Toyota. It’s a
better car. The morale of labor
is bad. It’s pride, baby,
pride that’s important.”

In typical fashion, Lord left
the audience — especially the
students — with a challenge.

“It’s your challenge to turn
this industrial economy around.
It’s your challenge to find jobs.
Maybe some progress is not
good if it causes social
catastrophe,”’ he noted.

“Get involved, like I did with
Octavia. I knew what it was all
about. Reduce government size.
Increase productivity. If you
can stuff envelopes, stuff ’em
right. Don’t be a s.o.b. Be
proud. Look in that mirror and
smile. Don’t just get by. Do
your best. Improve your educa-
tion. It’s the hope of the future.
Stand up and be counted. And,
above all, marry bigger and
better and smarter women and
send your boys to W&L.”’

After being overwhelmed
recently by two of the nation’s
top Division I teams, the Wash-
ington and Lee lacrosse team
was able to push third-ranked
Syracuse into overtime before
the Orangemen could avoid an
upset, 11-10. Then, the Generals
reversed form by coming from
behind against Roanoke to win
in overtime, 10-9, on Sandy
Brown’s bouncer from 15 yards.

Syracuse’s Brad Kotz ended
the Generals’ upset hopes with
his third goal of the game, com-
ing less than a minute into the
extra period.

Syracuse had to come back

twice in the fourtn quarter 10
send the game into the extra
session. Goals by Tim Nelson
and Art Lux tied it with 9:34
left, but the Generals went up
10-9 on a rebound goal by John
Buttarazzi a minute later. W&L
goalie John DiDuro came up
with several big saves with
around five minutes left, but
Tom Korrie used a bouncer to
tie it for the final time with 2:05
left.

Kotz controlled the faceoff in
overtime and went behind the
Generals’ goal before he moved
in front to release a backhander
that trickled past DiDuro, who
made the save but could not find
the ball.

Washington and Lee’s
baseball team lost an Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference
playoff semi-final game to
Eastern Mennonite and lost to
Virginia Military Institute to
drop its record to 8-13-1 overall.

Easter Mennonite scored nine
runs in the first three innings
and then held off a Generals’
rally to beat W&L 11-6 Saturday
at Lynchburg.

“In the third inning we had
three throwing errors that real-
ly hurt us,” W&L Coach Jim
Murdock said. ‘“‘We were just a
little overly agressive in the
field,” he said.

W&L collected 14 hits in the
game. Senior Jody Harris led
the Generals’ attack with three
hits. Senior Chris Cavalline,
junior Mike Walsh, sophomore
Chip Hutchins and freshman
Hugh Finkelstein all had two
hits.

Trailing 9-0, the Generals
fought back with three runs in
the fourth inning. A two-run
single by sophomore Mike
Jacoby highlighted the inning.

Walsh’s two-run home run in
the sixth inning closed the
Generals to with in 9-5, but the
Royals never allowed the
Generals to get any closer than
that.

championship game to Lyn-
chburg College 20-0. Lynchburg
reached the finals by defeating
Hampden-Sydney 8-2.

This was the second time in
three years that W&L has
reached the ODAC playoffs.
The Generals won four of their
final six games to earn the third
seed in the playoffs.

‘We played well,’”’ Murdock
said of his team’s performance
in the last week of the season.
“We only had one really disap-
pointing loss and that was Lyn-
chburg,”’ he said.

Murdock said that the team’s
defense has improved over last
year’s performance. The entire
infield has improved defensive-
ly, Murdock said.

VMI scored four runs in the
ninth inning to edge the
Generals 7-4 Tuesday at VMI.

Trailing 3-2 in the seventh, the
Generals tied the game on a
double by Jacoby and an RBI
single by Harris.

W&L took the lead with a
single run in the eighth inning.
Chris Cavalline, who knocked
two W&L runs in the first inning
with a double, drove in Finkels-
tein with a triple to right center
field.

W&L concludes its season
with a doubleheader Saturday

pleased with our effort,’ said
W&L coach Jack Emmer. “‘It
was a tremendous improve-
ment’’ after the Virginia and
North Carolina games, in which
the Generals were outscored by
a total of 40-11.

W&L kept up with Syracuse
by using a “stack offense,
which involves putting two at-
tackmen at either side of the
goal while another man handles
the ball behind the goal. The
strategy is used to attract two
defenders to the ball, leaving at
least one attacker uncovered.

Said Emmer of the slow-
paced offense, ‘‘It gave us an
opportunity to win and gave us
confidence in the extra-man of-
fense and extra-man defense. It
also gave us confidence to go
after the ground balls
agressively.”

W&L got its first two goals off
the stack offense. Freshman
Bill Holmes made it 1-1 with his
first goal of the season, while
Syracuse had two men out with
penalties. Caulley Deringer fed
Holmes from behind the goal
for the open shot. Geoff Wood,
who had three goals and an
assist, then found Stu Kiehne in
front to make it 2-2. After the
Orangemen ran off three
straight goals in the second
quarter, Holmes and Lee
Heimert scored 13 seconds
apart to close the deficit to one,
(5-4), at halftime.

Down 5-2 at the half, W&L us-
ed an aggressive riding defense

against the Roanoke clear while

scoring four straight goals to
take a 6-5 lead. Paul Goldsmith
scored the last goal of the
quarter to tie it at six.

In the fourth, W&L’s John
Doub and the Maroons’ Rocco
Guglielmo exchanged scores
for a 7-7 deadlock. Roanoke took
its last lead when Sean Smith,
who came into the game with 38
goals put in his only goal of the
day. Doub responded 40 seconds
later with his 12th goal of the
year. Brown and Guglielno
traded goals with around two
minutes left to send it into the
sudden-death period.

Roanoke had the ball for the
last 50 seconds after a timeout
but could not get a shot on goal
against a tight W&L defense.

The Maroons won the face-off
to start overtime and got off two
shots before the Generals
timeout. After a shot by Doub
just went wide, Brown brought
in the ball from the restraining
line and put in the winner 1:44
into the extra period.

W&L also got three goals and
an assist from Bill Holmes.
Geoff Wood had two goals in the
first half to push his team-
leading total to 25.

The Generals will play their
last home game of the season
tomorrow against Hampden-
Sydney. Opening face-off is at 2
p.m. It will be the first time the
varsity teams have faced each
other.

Tracksters settle

for 4th in ODACs

By CHRIS FULTON
Phi Staff Writer

“We had some good in-
dividual performances, but
team-wise, we should have easi-
ly had third,”’ head coach Nor-
ris Aldridge commented about
W&L’s season finale, the
seventh ODAC Track and Field
Championships at Lynchburg
College.

Bridgewater nipped the
Generals by a single point, plac-
ing W&L in fourth in a field of
eight teams. Lynchburg stole
the meet with 166 team points
followed by Roanoke (97),
Bridgewater (86), W&L (85),
Emory & Henry (54), Eastern

Mennonite (22), Maryville (7)
and Catholic (5).

The bright spots of the meet
for W&L were once again the
performances of Angus
McBryde and Mark Pembroke.
McBryde, who always seems to
do all of his record breaking and
winning in two’s, successfully
defended his 1500-meter title
and added a win in the 5000-
meter race. His times were
4:00.32 and 15:28.27 respective-
ly. Pembroke, although nipped
at the tape by .07 seconds, broke
the school record in the 800-
meter run with a time of 1:55.52.

Both Pembroke and McBryde
will travel to the University of

Netters sweep doubles,

capture 5th ODAC title

Washington and Lee swept all
three doubles flights in a thrill-
ing 64-63 upset Saturday over
host Lynchburg College to win
the seventh Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Tennis
Championships. It was the
Generals’ fifth title since the
tournament’s inception.

The seven member team
trailed 59-57 after the six singles
finals. However, the Generals
then went on to tie Lynchburg
with wins at flight two and three
doubles to set the stage for the
title-clinching third-set victory
at flight one doubles. W&L only
captured two of. the six singles
titles, thus putting all the
pressure on the doubles flights.

In flight three doubles the
Generals faced the Emory &
Henry team of Joe Vaughan and
Ben Hall. W&L’s team of
sophomore Anthonie Frens and
junior Jim Irwin faced two
match points, down 5-3 in the

third set, only to come back to
win 6-2, 2-6, 7-5.

Things looked only mildly bet-
ter in the flight two doubles
final, as W&L’s Andy Haring
and Charlie Kalocsay were
down 4-5 in the first set against
Lynchburg. However, the
Generals survived again, tak-
ing the final over the Hornets,
team of Jeff Armbruster and
Max Henderson 7-6, 3-6’ 6-2.

With the ODAC championship
on the line, the Generals flight
one doubles team of Craig Can-
non and Steve Denny fought off
Lynchburg’s Buzz Frey (ODAC
Player-of-the-Year) and Jim
Sargent. W&L took another
three-set vistory to cop the
team title.

W&L shared their two singles
championships with host Lyn-
chburg and Emory and Henry.
At flight two Denny drubbed
Lynchburg’s Henderson, 6-1,

 

Time out....

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

...Can’t ignore what happened
on Wilson Field on Saturday
afternoon. Maybe the Generals
finally came into their own.
Maybe Syracuse was  over-
rated. Perhaps, but this I
believe is irrelevant. What is
relevant is the high degree of in-
tensity that not one or two W&L
players, but that the entire
team showed throughout the
contest. The intensity
manifested itself most
noticeably in the Generals’
defense. It’s here where the
Generals would stand up and
continually deny Syracuse,
keeping the game within reach
for the offense. It was
something that seemed to be
missing in prior efforts. It
would be sad and unfair to call
Saturday’s game a_ loss,
because, for the most part,
Syracuse should have felt lucky
to be on the same field as W&L.
What can be said of the game is
this: The score may have been
10-11 and our record may be 36
but the group of winners isn’t
always the team that scores
more goals...

..Hat tipping ceremonies:
Plaudits extended to the tennis

6-2, while at flight four Haring
defeated another Lynchburg
foe, Jeff Armbruster, 6-0, 7-5.

Overall, W&L took five flight
titles, one runner-up (Charlie
Kalocsay at flight six), two
third-places (Cannon at flight
one and freshman Scott Adams
at flight five), and one fourth
place (Irwin at flight three), for
a total of 64 points.

Since the ODAC title, Cannon
and Denny, ranked 50 and 54 na-
tionally in Division III, have
won bids to play both singles

team for capturing last
weekend’s ODAC champion-
ships. Belated congrats to the
golfers on their ODAC title,

to see Rod Carew batting .470

Showing third were sopho-
more Frank Pittman in the
1500-meter run, senior Alan Ar-
mitage in the 110-meter high
hurdles, and the mile relay
team of Pembroke, junior Paul
Chapman, sophomore Gene
Girard and freshman Ron
Moody. :

Reflecting on the 5-1 season,
Aldridge noted three new school
record holders. Angus McBryde
set two records, the 5000-meter
and 3000-meter runs with times
of 15:11.7 and 9:04.0. Mark
Pembroke set a record in the
800-meter run at 1:55.51. Alan
Armitage set a record in the
110-meter high hurdles at 15.6
seconds.

W&L loses only four gradu-
ating seniors: Alan Armitage,
Gene Fellin, Sparky Anderson,
and Eric Nelson; however Ar-
mitage and Nelson are school
record holders. Aldridge is look-
ing forward to next year —
with, he added, hopefully more
crowd support. Asked about in-
coming freshmen next year,
Aldridge said, “I have to see
them running around our track
before I’ll say anything about
them.’’
