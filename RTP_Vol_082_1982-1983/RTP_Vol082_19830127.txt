International student
speaks out on W&L

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

At the Founder’s Day-ODK
Convocation last Wednesday,
Seng-Kah ‘‘Henry” Baey was
“tapped” into the honorary
leadership fraternity. Consider-
ing he is an international stu-
dent, his induction stands as a
great accomplishment, but for
Henry Baey it only seemed nat-
ural in view of his past ac-
complishments.

For most people, Singapore is
but a.speck on the map, a city
which holds the same name as
the nation in which it is found.

But to Henry Baey, ’83C,
Singapore is home.

A center for trade and finance
in Southeast Asia, Singapore
boasts the second highest stand-
ard of living in the region, se-
cond only to Japan, and its port
is the third busiest in terms of
tonnage passing through its
waters. Leaving the Singapore
culture dominated by Chinese
to attend W&L was a big step
for Baey, one which he will not
soon forget. Several differences
stand between the two cultures,
and Baey’s experiences at W&L
have given him greater insight
into both styles of living.

“There is a great difference
in culture between the two coun-
tries. To an American, the Far
Eastern culture is very strange.
Not everybody understands the
culture nor can appreciate
things being done in a different
way,” Baey said.

‘‘America is so big in size that
it will always have an influence
on the rest of the world,”’ he ex-
plained.

“If Americans do not try to
understand or appreciate how
others are, they will always be
isolated from the rest of the
world,” :

FD tickets

In an attempt to establish a
better understanding of foreign
cultures, Baey has devoted a
great deal of his time to the In-
ternational Club on campus,
seeing under his direction the
purchase and opening of the In-
ternational House this past
September. Baey feels there is
a need for a larger international
student body at W&L to allow
for greater personal exposure
and understanding of other
countries and peoples.

“The school provides excep-
tionally good resources for the
American student, but there is a
lack of individuals in the ad-
ministration to whom foreign
students can relate,” said Baey.

“The club cannot survive as
foreign students alone. Ameri-
cans are also needed. Hope-
fully, there will be a strong
organization in the future for
those who need it,’’ Baey said.

One difference between the
two cultures is the lack of man-
datory military service here. In
Singapore, all males are re-
quired by law to serve at least
one to two years for basic train-
ing and a maximum of 30 days
per year thereafter for reser-
vist training. After finishing the
equivalent of high school, Baey
entered the Singapore army
where he was selected as a can-
didate for Officer-Cadet School.
After nine months of rigorous
training, Baey was commis-
sioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and
chose to specialize in armor

warfare. After serving with the

Army for an additional year
and a half as a tank platoon
commander, Baey was com-
missioned full lieutenant as he
left the army.

“Those years in the army are
the best times. The fun, the
comraderie, is not soon forgot-

ten,” said Baey. “If I have a
son, I’ll want him to go into the
army, too. It gives you time to
grow up, to decide what you
want to do.”

Baey’s leadership success in
the army found its roots in his
earlier experiences with Boy
Scouting. At 16, Baey was the
Senior Patrol leader of a troop
of 160 scouts, and when he went
in to a new school to finish his
pre-university studies, he
founded the Venture Scout unit
in is new school. By his 18th bir-
thday, Baey had been presented
with the highest scout award in
Singapore, the President’s
Scout Award personally
presented by the President of
Singapore.

“I enjoyed Scouting,” Baey
said. “It really shaped and
changed me.”’

With his awards for leader-
ship giving merit to his tran-
script, Baey began applying to
colleges in the United States in
his final year in the army. Con-
centrating his search around
Hollins College where both his
sisters were attending, Baey
finally settled upon W&L.

“I chose W&L largely
because some American friends
in Singapore recommended it,”
Baey said, adding that being
near members of his family
always helped.

Applying to an American
school and then attending the
school is more difficult for a
foreigner than for an American.
Having never visited this coun-
try before his freshman year,
Baey at first had a difficult time
with the differences in societies
and educational systems.

“When it comes to studies,
there is more pressure to do
well at home. It is more com-

EC approves price boost

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

Tickets for this year’s Fancy
Dress weekend will cost $30
which is a five dollar increase
over last year.

Student Activities Board
Chairman Lanier Edge, flanked
by FD Director John Haywood
and Treasurer Andy Cooney,
presented the SAB’s argument
for the increase. Edge said that
a $5 increase is necessary as a
“margin of safety.”

Haywood noted that this
year’s budget will be about
$48,000 as opposed to $72,000 last
year. Edge and Haywood as-
sured the EC that most of the
art and design is being done by

students. Last year, much of the
money spent went to outside ar-
tists and contractors even
though the work could have
been done by students.

The ticket price for the Thurs-
day night party will be deter-
mined when the decoration ex-
penses for the Ball are more
definite, Edge said.

Steve Connett, freshman
representative, asked if it
might be possible to extend the
time of the Ball from its current
8:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. time slot. “It
sounds like an eighth grade
prom,”’ Connett said.

Haywood replied that the ad-
ministration will not let them
extend the time, saying that the

SAB had tried last year.
“They’ve pretty much said we
become lawless animals at
one,’ Haywood said.

EC President Bennett Ross
and Vice President Morgan
Griffith reviewed the SAB
budget and agreed that the in-
crease was necessary.

In contrast to the SAB’s $5 in-
crease, the Registrar’s office
sent the EC a letter stating that
the drop/add fee would be
reduced by $5. This was the
result of a campaign by Mason
and sophomore representative
Dave Jonson, to make the fee
$5. The two were commended
by their colleagues on the com-
mittee.

This weekend

Superdance

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s most
important and second most im-
pressive party of the year is
scheduled for this coming week-
end. Thirty hours of continuous
entertainment will be provided
at this year’s Superdance for
the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

Calling the Superdance,
“‘W&L’s longest party,’’ Dance
Committee Chairman Town-
send Oast is encouraging
everyone to ‘‘support those who
are dancing for those who can’t,
by attending W&L’s 30 round
fight against M.D.”

The party will start at 8:00
p.m. Friday in Evans Dining
Hall. Tickets are good for the
entire’ weekend and will be
available at the door for $5 per
person or $8 couple.

Certainly the most attractive
aspect of the dance will be the
20 hours of live bands that will
appear. Skip Castro will play
from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. and
Steps will perform from 11:00
p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday
night. The Red Ball Jets will ap-
pear from 6:00 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.
and Casper will play from 10:00
p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Saturday
night.

The other ten hours of the
Superdance will include pie
throws and similar events for
the spectators. The pie throw
schedule has Major John J.
Mears appearing at 10:30 p.m.
and Dean of the Commerce
School Edward Atwood showing
his face at 11:45 on Friday
night. On Saturday, Professor
Julius Overbeck will appear at
9:45 p.m., Professor Hampden
H. Smith at 11:00 p.m. and
Coach Gary Fallon at midnight.

Oast noted that all students on
contract with the the Dining
Hall are donating Saturday’s
dinner to the MDA and should
get the weekend meal schedule
from Jerry Darrell.

For anyone who has not had a
chance to make a donation, but
would still like to, a direct
phone line (tel. 463-7772) has
been established for those who

would like to phone in contribu-
tions.
Finally, Oast noted that

Washington Street in front of
the Student Center will be clos-
ed to traffic during the
weekend. A valid ID must be
shown at the door to get into the
dance and the public is invited
to “a good time for a good
cause,’’ Oast said.

No justice in
honor trials

To the Editor

As I am writing this, I am
thinking that as you are reading
this, an honor trial will be tak-
ing place in Lewis Hall. This let-
ter is about the justice (or lack
thereof) at Washington and
Lee.

Those who know me are
aware that I am strongly in
favor of abolishing the Honor
Code. My reason is that I feel
that justice is never served in a
trial as it is presented at W&L.
Just as one example, in the last
trial, one may remember a test.
Anyone who knows federal
evidence rules knows that that
test may not be admitted as
evidence (and therefore no ref-
erences may be made to it). As
I guessed, neither the
“lawyers” nor the ‘‘judge’’
knew about evidence laws.
“And besides, they don’t apply
here.”” If they don’t, they
should. These rules are to pro-
tect the innocent until proven
guilty, then these rules should
2 in effect. Besides, in the case
of appeals of honor trial convic-
tions, those laws DO go into ef-
fect.

Let us assume that one is
wrongly convicted (as does oc-
casionally happen). What
becomes of the convictee? If he
is a senior, his life is ruined. Try
getting a job and answering, ‘‘If
you have enough credits, why
didn’t you graduate?’ The
same applies for transfers. Pro-
ponents state that. some
students have transferred and
have become successful doctors
and lawyers, Phi Beta Kappa,
and all that jazz. If they did,
then they should never have
been convicted. Obviously,
something is wrong.

I also believe that if the defen-
dant wins his case, the original
plaintiff should be brought up
on honor charges — after all,
one of them is lying. Perhaps
even both. As for the Executive
Committee’s representation of

Mussorgsky’s stirring drama,
“Boris Godunov,’ will be
broadcast live from the
Metropolitan Opera House on
Saturday January 29, at 1:30
p.m. over WLUR-FM (91.5),
Washington and Lee’s campus
radio station. A music critic
wrote recently: ‘‘The
Metropolitan Opera’s landmark
production of Mussorgsky’s
‘Boris Godunov’ returned in
splendor ... and is even more
compelling and successful now
than when it was first presented
in 1974 ... This ‘Boris’ is a
fabulous production and one of

 

the plaintiff’s case, the officers
of the EC may be brought up on
various charges in a real court,
were a previous ruling over-
turned. However, little more
may be done.

There is also the question of
an unbiased trial. In one trial,
one-fifth of the student body
was on vacation! In another,
half the jury was law students!
That’s not exactly a jury of
one’s peers. The ‘‘judge”’ in our
trial today is a sub-normal law
student. He knows little of the
real-world law, and I certainly
hope that he can’t get a job after
he graduates. He certainly has
no reason for being SBA presi-
dent. As for the “lawyers,” a
strong case may be made for
outside attorneys. The students
who represent both sides usual-
ly consider the trial a game, a
challenge, a toy. They do not
realize that they are dealing
with someone’s life.

Abolishing a _ student-run
honor system is a viable solu-
tion. I have seen half of the EC
commit honor violations during
some time during my stay here.
In high school and here in col-
lege, I know that honor systems
do not work. They cannot. Stu-
dents are, for the most part, too
young to handle the respon-
sibilities of - self-government.
Those who are in office are only
there for the resume, for some
career in business, or for some
career in politics. However, the
Executive Committee should
not be a testing ground for some
underachievers. The professors
are better judges of cheaters
than students are. I say, let
them handle a problem in their
own way, either by deduction of
points on an assignment or by
automatic failure. Better that
way than in a kangaroo court,
where there is absolutely no
chance of justice one way or the
other.

WEL tradition

 

Where is Betty Mohler?

(Editor’s Note: This letter ad-
dressed to President Wilson was
also sent to the Phi for publica-
tion.)

Dear President Wilson:

From my first day at Wash-
ington and Lee University, one
word, one concept, above all
others became the primary
symbol, for me at least, of
every ideal our university
upheld. This word, concept or
belief, whichever you choose to
name it, is TRADITION—one of
the strongest foundations of
W&L; a ‘“‘column”’ of strength
far more substantial than the
Colonnade or the visible sup-
ports which uphold our univer-
sity. Whether the topic of
discussion is our Honor System,
the historic beauty of our cam-
pus, or the warmth and concern
of our Administration and
Faculty, traditions are definite-
ly a part of W&L which we
students should always be able
to call ‘‘ours.”’

As a student who admires,
believes, and lives by the “W&L
Tradition” I’m worried. If re-
cent small, but significant,
changes in Washington Hall
prove prophetic, then ‘“Tradi-
tions”’ may not always be an in-
tegral part of Washington and
Lee.

Have you been in Washington
Hall lately? Where is “‘B.J.?”
Where is Mrs. Mohler? This
question has been popping-up a
great deal lately, I have no idea
why the administration has
deprived students, professors,
and visitors alike of her smile
and welcome which she extends
to all who enter Washington
Hall. Indeed, the switching of
secretaries’ offices is no
business of mine. But I do know
that the space which once serv-
ed as the university’s most val-
uable public relations center is
now devoid of any warmth or
welcome. The entrance to
Washington Hall serves merely
as a showcase for ancient bowls

J and plates or vaguely ap-

preciable representations of
modern art — cold like a
museum. Yet, this is a small in-
cident of little significance?

I’ve always appreciated the
concern which our Admimistra-
tion has shown and our campus
has always seemed beautiful—a
climate conducive to the Honor
System and Traditions we
uphold. I suppose Betty Mohler
simply represented, for me
anyway, all those values rolled
into one charming, beautiful,
and honest lady. From her van-
tage point in Washington Hall
she confirmed for many, on a
daily basis, all the Traditions
we believe in —an action above
and beyond her ‘‘call to duty.”’

You know, professors and of-
ficials still speak as they pass
during the day and I hold on to
the Honor System even more
than I did yesterday. I wonder if
I’m over reacting. Yet I can see

and feel, every time I go into
Washington Hall, that some-
thing important, vitally impor-
tant, is missing. It seems as if
some of the warmth and con-
cern, once an_ all-important
Tradition at W&L, has now been
removed for the sake of ...
We’ve lost one small piece of
“W&L’s Tradition’ and _ it’s
possible, in time, that other
Traditions may be taken from
us also.

When I walk down the cor-
ridor of Washington Hall it’s dif-
ferent now. I look at the coldly
quiet exhibits and remember
when traditions and smiles
were an accepted part of the
W&L Tradition. Then I listen to
my footsteps echo in the silence
as I walk on through,

Sincerely,
Ruben Ray Hudson, Jr.

Military Future

War with hi-tech

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi Staff Writer

High-technology will be the
key to war in the future, accord-
ing to Lt. Gen. Paul Gorman
who spoke at Virginia Military
Institute last Thursday night.

Gen. Gorman, a 1950 grad-
uate of the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, and a
former special officer in the
Central Intelligence Agency is
currently the special assistant
to the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.

Gorman said that the spe-
cialization of industry in the
United States would require
that the U.S. have allies in
Europe and North East Asia.
Because U.S. industry is begin-
ning to concentrate on building
high-technology equipment, it is
cheaper for the U.S. to buy
ships from Poland or South
Korea than to build them.

“We need leaders who can
cope with the problems of spe-
cialized weapon systems,” Gor-
man told the crowd of more
than 150.

In the past, the Defense
Department has had trouble
with waste and overspending.
This was evident with both the
TRX-111 and C-5A Air Force
contracts of the past. In these
cases, there was a total of near-
ly 2.5 billion dollars in waste
and cost-overruns.

When asked how the Defense
Department would cope with
the waste that might accom-
pany the expensive new spe-
cialized systems, Gorman
replied, ‘With great difficulty.”

“If you think you’ve seen
waste in the old systems, wait
until the new ones come out,”

 

Gorman said.

Gorman referred to the press
several times as neoLuddites,
‘trying to wreck new ships and
tanks programmatically.’’ Lud-
dites were workers in the early
1800s who destroyed textiles
machinery because’ they
thought mechanization would
result in diminished employ-
ment.

Gorman was very vocal in his
support of the MX/Peacekeeper
missile system. ‘During the
past year we have debated the
use of the MX. During that time
the Soviets have deployed 1400
warheads comparable to the
MX,” Gorman said.

Gorman was asked how he
felt about mutual investigation
as a means of controlling how
many warheads the Soviets
have. ‘I would be delighted to
put more trust in the Soviets,
but they are an utterly un-
trustworthy lot,’’ Gorman said.

With regard to manpower,
Gorman said that technology
has allowed fewer men to cover
a larger area. ‘“Your army is to-
day, manpower-lean,” Gorman
said.

This increased use of more
sophisticated technology will
create new problems, Gorman
said, but he asked for them to be
thought of as ‘‘growth pains.”’

‘Most of our problems with
high-technology will be with
dumb generals, not dumb pri-
vates. The privates won’t be us-
ing the equipment,” Gorman
said. ,

Gorman’s speech was spon-
sored by the International
Studies Program of the Depart-
ment of History and Politics at
VMI.

Phi Staff Writer

Dr. Roger C. Molander, ex-
ecutive director of the Ground
Zero nuclear awareness group
and author of Nuclear War:
What’s in it For You?, will
speak at Lee Chapel next Tues-
day night as part of the Contact
speaker series.

Molander served on the Na-
tional Security staff in the
White House from 1974 to 1981,
under the administrations of
Nixon, Ford, and Carter. His
principal duties included strate-
gic nuclear policy issues. He
chaired the committee which
prepared all of the analytical
material for the SALT negotia-
tions.

Before that, he was employed
in the Defense Department.

Ground Zero is an organiza-
tion that calls for international
publicity and national debate on
nuclear issues. Known as an
anti-nuclear weapons group,
Ground Zero’s basic strategy is
to educate both candidates and
citizens about the threat of
nuclear war and how to ap-
proach the problems of preven-
ting it.

Molander will be the first
speaker in Contact’s attempt to
reestablish itself after a much-
maligned fall term. The group
recently received compliments
though from the Executive
Committee for the effort being
put into this term.

Band, the New Orleans musi-
cians who have traveled the
world playing the famous music
they created decades ago, will
hold a concert on Thursday,
Feb. 3, at 8 p.m. in the Roanoke

““Jass”’ — as it was originally
called — is a creative amalgam
of marches, quadrilles, blues,
spirituals and ragtime. It’s
music these very men drew
from the saloons, the streets
and the river boats when this
century was still young.

Although most of the musi-
cians are over sixty, their
music is bright, young, filled
with spirit and played with tech-
nical excellence.

Members of the band who will
play here are Alfred (Father

Reviews:

Fagen’s latest is a welcome change

By JOHN RILEY
Phi Staff Writer

With the release of ‘The
Nightfly,’’ Donald Fagen has
emerged as one of the very best
composers and arrangers in
contemporary music, and the
album’s success on the charts in
recent weeks is a reassuring
sign that, even with the current
glut of electronic novelties and
screaming distortion, there is
still a market for carefully
crafted, understated music.

“The Nightfly” is Fagen’s
first solo album without his
longtime songwriting and per-
forming partner, Walter
Becker. Fagen and Becker
were the nucleus of the very
popular recording group, Steely
Dan, and “The Nightfly” car-
ries on the Steely Dan sound,

mostly through Fagen’s distinc-
tive and engaging vocals.
Fagen is one of a select few who
can boast a unique, recogniza-
ble vocal style, and his singing
on this new album is every bit
as good as on any of the Steely
Dan albums. What ‘‘The Nightf-
ly” lacks that Steely Dan had
are the ambiguous lyrics and
obscure word jokes. that
sometimes made Steely Dan
seem pretentious.

Fagen says in his liner notes,
“The songs on this album repre-

‘sent certain fantasies that

might have been entertained by
a young man growing up in the
remote suburbs of a northeast-
ern city during the late fifites
and early sixties, ie., one of my
general height, weight, and

build.”” Most of the album
adheres to this theme, produc-
ing some creative and amusing
flashbacks to another era.
“1.G.Y. (International Geophy-
sical Year),’”’ the single from
the album, opens side one with a
tongue-in-cheek essay on the
benefits of future technology.
‘Here at home we'll play in the
city. Powered by the sun,
perfect weather for a streamlin-
ed world, There’ll be Spandex
jackets, One for everyone.” A
synthesizer blues harp solo by
Fagen and a horn section led by

“They Call Me Bruce’ is
perhaps supposed to be to Kung

Fu movies what Airplane was to
disaster films. Perhaps not.
Whatever it is supposed to be,
“They Call Me Bruce’’ fails,
unless it aims to be an unenter-
taining, poorly made film, in
which case it succeeds. The
movie attempts to find its
humorous element by poking
fun at every ethnic group it can.

You know the film is in trou-
ble when, at the very beginning,
the star (Bruce), played by
Johnny Yune, is told that the
most important thing in life is
“‘broads.”’ He is then told there

is a woman in America who will
take care of him. Off he goes to
America, where, for some
strange reason, we find him as
a cook for a mafioso chief.
Every actor in the mafia bunch
speaks with the fresh-off-the-
boat accent. (Whattsa matta? I
puncha you ina the nose!) It’s
ironic that Bruce, fresh from
China speaks better than any-
one else in the film. Well, Dumb
Bruce is employed by the mafia
to deliver cocaine all across the
United States. Bruce, however,
thinks it’s flour, which opens
the veiwer up to at least 15
“hilarious” episodes where
Bruce tries to give the “flour’’
to other mafioso chiefs, local

The screenplay, written by
Johnny Yune not only makes all
Italians look idiotic, but also
shows all Jews to be schmucks,
and all Blacks to be bouncing
fools carrying ghetto blasters or
bug-eyed evangelists. All small
town cops are hicks, and so on.
The movie’s not only not funny
but it is also insulting.

To cap it all off, the conclu-

which opens with ‘‘The New
Frontier,” a dancy tale of a
summer bomb shelter party,
with appropriate 1960’s im-
agery. ‘“‘We’ve got provisions
and lots of beer, The key word is
survival on the new frontier,”
sings Fagen, and ‘Introduce
me to that big blond, She’s got a
touch of Tuesday Wells.’’ Next
is the title track, the lament of a

late night jazz DJ featuring
strong mming by Jeff Por-

caro of Toto and a solo by
veteran studio guitarist Larry
Carlton. ‘‘The Goodbye Look’”’
describes the plight of an
American stuck in Cuba during
the Castro revolt in Latin
rhythm and percussion. The un-
fortunate tourist notices that,
“The rules are changed, it’s not
the same, It’s all new players in

a whole new ball game’’ and
finally, ‘‘I know what happens, I
read the book, I believe I just
got the goodbye look.” ‘The
Nightfly” closes with ‘Walk
Between the Raindrops,”’ a sur-
prisingly lightweight, eight-to-
the-bar song of two lovers ina
Miami rainstorm, with lively
organ soloing by Donald Fagen.

Sometimes the craftsmanship
which makes “‘The Nighfly’’ so
enjoyable results in overconser-
vatism, until you wish one of the
famous and talented studio
musicians on the album would
let loose and rip out a hot solo,
but it is an excellent record
throughout and will bear re-
peated listening. “‘The Nightfly
is a beacon of professionalism
in the murky fog of today’s
music industry.

also not to forget about the
broads. What laughs

This horrible film was
directed by Elliot Hong and

One note needs to be given to
Tommy Vig, who wrote the

Blood drive Tuesday

The Washington and Lee
University chapter of Chi Psi
social fraternity and the
American Red Cross will spon-
sor a blood drive on Tuesday,
February 1, from 11 a.m. to 5
p.m. in Doremus Gymnasium
on the W&L campus.

Reservations are not
necessary but may be made by
calling 463-9111, Ext. 299.

According to officials of the
Chi Psi Fraterniry, two recent
campus visits by the Red Cross
Bloodmobile were extremely
successful with more than 200

donors taking part in the drive
last February and a similar
event last October resulting in
130 percent of the Red Cross
quota for the day. '

Chi Psi is offering a prize of
two kegs of beer to the fraterni-
ty(s) or athletic team(s) that
has/have the greatest percen-
tage of participation in the
blood drive. Additionally,
Coach Miller has agreed to
allow any Physical Education
student who donates blood to
receive one extra cut from the
Physical Education class in
which he is currently enrolled.

Poet reads Tuesday

The Glasgow Endowment
Committee at Washington and
Lee University will present the
first in a series of readings by
prominent American poets
when Robert Pack reads from
his works. on Tuesday, Febru-
ary 1, at 4 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library.

The reading is free and open
to the public.

The Glasgow Committee’s
poetry series will include
readings by Anthony Hecht,
poetry consultant to the Library
of Congress, in March and
Howard Moss, poetry editor of
the New Yorker, in April.

Pack is a 1951 graduate of
Dartmouth College with a
master’s degree from Columbia
University. He is currently
Abernethy Professor of
American Literature at Mid-
dlebury College, where he has
taught for 16 years.

He has been the director of
the Bread Loaf Writers’ Con-
ference since 1973 and is a
former Fulbright Fellow.

 

Pack: is the author of seven
volumes of poetry with an
eighth volume, “Faces In A
Single Tree,” to be published
this year.

His poems have received
critical acclaim. Of one of
Pack’s more recent volumes,
“Waking to My Name,” for in-
stance, Hecht has _ written:
“These poems, quietly but firm-
ly spoken, find a center in
hearth and heart. Often enough
they are sponsored by moods of
gratitude and elation, such as
might be addressed in other
forms and times to gods of the
home and the natural land-
scape.”

Pack, who has won several
important awards for his
poetry, is the author of an early
study of Wallace Stevens and
has edited several important
anthologies.

The Glasgow Endowment
Committee was established by
the 1960 bequest of Arthur
Graham Glasgow ‘‘to promote
the art of expression by pen and
tongue.’

petitive there, and that tends to
take any enjoyment out of col-
lege and make it a routine,”
Baey said. “In the U.S. you
must take certain courses
before the major work unlike in
Singapore where you specialize
in one subject from your
freshman year on.

At first at W&L, I thought
‘Why take sociology, psy-
chology, and religion?’ I want to
take economics and business
courses.’ But now I see the
value of a liberal arts educa-
tion.”

Baey also sees a difference
between the students’ attitudes
here and in Singapore.

“The difference is mostly in ©

how we interact here, what is
talked about at parties,’ Baey
said. ‘‘In Singapore, the univer-
sity is purely academic.
Students live at home, not on a
campus. There are no frats or
anything of that sort.”

The informality of many pro-
fessors in and out of the
classroom is also a big dif-
ference for Baey.

“There, you call the instruc-
tor ‘Sir’ or Professor’’ before
addressing any question. Here,
itis very different. I found it dif-

Foreign student Seng-Kah “

ficult to relate to a professor the
first year. I was very formal
with them. I really couldn’t be
comfortable around them after
being in the army.” Henry said.

Henry’s understanding of
American culture has been
helped by his joining the Chi Psi
fraternity.

“The most important thing is
to understand the different
mentalities of life here. Joining
a frat helps. You get into a tight-
knit group and you get to know a
variety of personalities,’ he ex-
plained.

Roanoke ends streak;
Generals win two, 12-3

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Roanoke College halted the
Washington and Lee basketball
team’s winning streak at nine
last Thursday, but the Generals
rebounded to defeat Lynchburg
College Saturday and Eastern
Mennonite College Tuesday to
raise their Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference record to 5-2
and their overall mark to 12-3.

While the Generals exploded
to an early lead against Roa-
noke, the Maroons fought back
to claim a _ 92-89 victory.
However, it took three overtime
periods for Roanoke, ranked se-
cond nationally in Division III,
to finally put the Generals
away.

‘We played a hell of a game,”’
W&L Coach Verne Canfield
asserted. ‘“‘We could not have
played a whole lot better than
that. It was a credit to the
starters who played with their
hearts.”

W&L got off to a super start
as junior Billy Yates canned a
three point play ten seconds into
the game. With 14:04 to play,

Brian Hanson’s basket expand-
ed the Generals lead to 20-6, and
the Generals held an impres-
sive 41-29 lead as the first half
ended.

Momentum shifted to Roa-
noke in the second half as the
Maroons’ Reggie Thomas fuel-'
ed their steady comeback with
his deadly outside shooting.
Shane Abernaty’s basket at
11:57 of the half gave Roanoke
its first lead of the night at 53-52.

After the lead had changed
hands several times down the’
stretch, the Generals found
themselves trailing 69-67 with 18
seconds to play. Senior Frank
Eppes tossed in a clutch basket
for the Generals with eight
seconds left to send the contest
into overtime.

W&L never led in any of the
three overtime periods. The
Generals were always in the
unenviable position of having to
tie the game up in the closing
seconds to extend the game
another five minutes.

“They showed a tremendous
amount of character,’ stated
Canfield of his team’s effort in
the overtime periods.

Some key points in critical
situations kept the Generals
alive through the first two over-
time periods. In the first over-
time period Hanson hit two foul
shots with 1:42 to play to tie the
game at 75-75, and the Generals
kept Roanoke off the score-
board for the remaining time.
In the second overtime Yates
hit an incredible three point
bucket with only seven seconds
left to tie the game at 83-83.

The third overtime period
proved to be fatal for the
Generals though. Trailing 90-89
with 13 seconds left, the
Generals made a crucial turn-
over that allowed Roanoke
seconds later to increase its
lead to 92-89 on a pair of free
throws. This time Yates’ three
point attempt in the closing
seconds missed the mark and
time ran out on W&L.

W&L got balanced scoring
from its starters with junior
John Lee Graves leading the at-
tack with 26 points. Yates hit for
25 points, Hanson for 25 points,
and Eppes for 12 points.

Although Coach Canfield

had been concerned that the
Generals might be a little slug-
gish following the disappoint-
ment against Roanoke, they
turned in a solid performance in
a 69-58 win Saturday at Lynch-
burg.
Forcing Lynchburg into 31
turnovers, W&L held a com-
manding lead throughout most
of the game. The Generals led
53-36 midway through the se-
cond half, and never allowed
Lynchburg to get any closer
than six points the rest of the
way.

“‘We played some of the best
team defense we've played this
year,”’ noted Canfield. ‘The
defense caused the turnovers.”’

Brian Hanson led the Gener-

als with 21 points and John Lee

W&L’s Frank K. Eppes hits a

Roanoke last Thursday night. Eppes’ basket sent the game into the
first of its three extra periods. The Maroons prevailed, 92-89,
however, to get their first victory in the Warner Center in three

years. (Phi photo by David Sprunt)

Graves and Frank Eppes con-
tributed 17 and 13 respectively.
Canfield reported that Graves
also played an _ outstanding
defensive game.

Tuesday night in the Warner
Center the Generals outlasted
Eastern Mennonite 79-71 in an
ODAC game.

W&L watched a 42-31 half
time lead evaporate into a 57-54
Eastern Mennonite lead with 7
minutes to play. However, the
Generals rallied to outscore the
Royals 25-14 the remainder of
the way to chalk up their fifth
league win.

Five Generals scored in dou-
ble figures with Billy Yates
leading the way with 19 points.
Brian Hanson added 17 points,
Frank Eppes 15, John Lee
Graves 11, and Lex Fitzenhagen
10.

Upsets highlight weekend

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

The hard work and personal
sacrifices of the W&L swim
team finally paid off in a pair of
upset victories that Coach Page
Remillard had been looking for.
The Generals traveled to West
Virginia on Friday night where
they picked up a 60-40 triumph
over Shepherd College and
returned home Saturday to
defeat the Hoyas of George-
town, 60-47.

“T’m satisfied with the wins,’’
remarked the fourth-year head
coach. All was not perfect,
though, for Remillard noted
that he was ‘‘dissapointed with
some swimmers.” Remillard
saw Jay Kendall and David
Lewis as not performing up to
their potential.

On the other side of the coin,
however, Remillard cited a host
of swimmers as turning in fine
efforts. Juniors Tim Rock and
Gary Meyer (whose consisten-
cy continues), sophomore
Taber Smith, and freshmen
Tim Standford and John Moody
were named by the W&L men-
tor.

“These wins reward the
swimmers for their preparation
and personal sacrifices in team
dual meets,’’ Remillard said.
He also noted that the Generals’
win-loss record is better than he
could have expected at this
point. ,

“It’s been a very successful
season,’’ commented the W&L
swim coach. Remillard explain-
ed, however, that ‘‘the em-
phasis will shift from the team
to the individual’ as the team
enters what the coach termed
“the most exciting part of the
season.”

“From now on, it’s a whole
new season,’”’ said Remillard,
referring to the fact that the
Generals will now be concen-
trating on their individual
strengths as they point to the
UNC-Wilmington Invitational
(February 17-19) and the Divi-
sion III Championships in Can-
ton, Ohio (March 17-19).

‘‘We’re a championship
team,”’ stated the coach, point-
ing to the Generals’ fine record
in Nationals, scoring in each of
the last seven years.

Saturday the Generals con-
tinue their dual meét season as
they travel to Williamsburg for
a meet against William and
Mary.

The weekend may have been
dismal for expectant road trip-
pers, but it was quite bright for
Coach Gary Franke and the
W&L wrestling squad. Led by
freshman Larry Anker and
sophomore Jeff Dixon, W&L
captured second place in the
fifth annual Washington and
Lee Invitational Saturday, edg-
ing out Lynchburg College by a
half-point.

“A lot of place-winners, that’s
what you need to do well as a
team in this kind of tourna-
ment,” said Franke, and that is
exactly what the Generals
achieved. W&L placed eight
wrestlers; one first-place
finish, one second, three thirds
and three fourths.

Larry Anker, ‘‘wrestling up to
his potential” according to
Franke, ploughed through se-
cond, third and first place seeds
respectively to win the 134. lb.
division. Anker, who was wor-
ried about his slow starts, was
quick enough to compile double-
digit victories over each of his
opponents; 18-5 over Catawba’s
