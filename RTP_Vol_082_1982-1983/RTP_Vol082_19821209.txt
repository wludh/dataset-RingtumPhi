University of Virginia bans Easter

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer
The University of Virginia an-
nounced last week that it will no
longer sanction Easters, a Spr-
ing party that has attracted

large crowds and caused
numerous problems in recent
years.

Ernest Ern, vice president for
student affairs, announced his
decision in a letter that said
Easters, ‘“‘has evolved into an
event which no longer serves
this university and its students

  

VOLUME 82

Ring

NUMBER 13

in an overall positive way.”’

The decision means that no
university property, personnel
or funds can be used to plan
Easters, usually held in mid-
April. The event in past years
has drawn from 12,000 to 20,000
people to Rugby Road, where
over 30 fraternities hold parties.

A commission was first form-
ed to study the problems of
Easters in the mid-1970’s, ac-
cording to Steven Kline, assis-
tant Dean of Students in charge
of fraternities and sororities.

Many of the problems that ex-
isted then were solved, how-
ever, through a planning com-
mittee that organized the event
each year.

However, the problems with
the large crowds remained,
and, said Kline, ‘It had gotten
much worse the last couple of
years.”

In February, Kline and Dean
of Students Robert Canevari
met with Charlottesville city of-
ficials and were informed that if
they could not get Easters

under control, it would have to
be abolished. ‘‘We weren’t able
to correct the crowd problem
last year,” Kline said.

That led to the formation
of a committee headed by
Canevari which recommended
to Ern in early November that
the university withdraw its
recognition of three of the four
major social weekends at the
university, Easters, Openings
and Mid-winters. Only
Homecoming was left unal-
tered by the recommenda-

tion. Before Ern made his deci-
sion to abolish Easters alone,
“There was a significant ex-
change and consideration of the
problems,’ Kline said.

Ern held an open forum for
students and closed meetings
with city officials, police, and
student representatives to
receive counter-proposals.

One such suggestion came fromD EC 10 198%

Analysis:

Both sides meet
to talk arms freeze

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

More than 100 persons of all
ages packed Classroom B of
Lewis Hall Tuesday night for a
debate on the nuclear freeze
proposal. They came to hear a
panel of four speakers discuss
the issues in a forum sponsored
by Pax Christi of Lexington. All
seats were filled and there were
many people sitting in the aisles
as emotions boiled just beneath
the surface of a_ structured
dialogue.

A handout detailing the
nuclear freeze proposal and
eight questions to be considered
by the panel was circulated
among the audience. The hand-
out proposed:

‘“‘To improve national and in-
ternational security, the United
States and the Soviet Union
should stop the nuclear arms
race. Specifically, they should
adopt a mutual freeze on
testing, production and deploy-
ment of nuclear weapons and of
missiles and new aircraft
designed primarily to deliver
nuclear weapons, This is an
essential, verifiable first step
toward lessening the risk of
nuclear war and reducing the
nuclear arsenals.”’

Speaking against the proposal
were Pat Mayerchak, professor
of strategic studies at the
Virginia Military Institute and
Fred Hadsel, director of the
George C. Marshall Founda
tion. Arguing in favor of the pro
posal were Bill Geimer, pro
fessor of law at Washington and
Lee University and John DiPip
pa, director of the Rockbridge
Legal Aid Society

“T would not
nuciear freeze p

support the
roposal as pro

vided because I think it is
somewhat unrealistic to expect
that we could guarantee a halt
to technological development in
nuclear weapons,’’ Mayerchak
said. ‘‘On the other hand, I do
believe that it is essential that
the United States pursue
negotiations with the Soviet
Union on the question of arms
limitations,”

“I support the freeze because
I think it is the first step
towards arms reductions,” said
DiPippa. “The reason I think it
is a first step is because it
leaves no room for manuever-
ing.

“A freeze is a bright line; it
says here and now we are going
to stop,” he said.

Fred Hadsel, who opposed the
freeze, was critical of the
Reagan administration’s ap-
proach to the problem. “‘Dim
the rhetoric and get down to the
problem, stop being bombastic
and deal with the question; that
is what our government should
do,”’ he said.

The panelists dealt with a
series of eight questions listed
on the handout. They ranged
from: ‘‘Is there ‘rough parity’
in nuclear capability between
the United States and the Soviet
Union?” to, “Is the freeze
verifiable?”’ and, ‘‘Are the cur-
rent levels of nuclear defense
spending economically sustain-
able for the U.S. and the Soviet
Union?”

‘The countries will do what
they feel is in their national in-
terest and by the logic of deter-
rence, sustaining it (nuclear
defense spending) is in the na-
tional interest,’ DiPippa said.

Anyone for frozen films?

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

For the second consecutive
week, the Executive Committee
has frozen the funds of one of its
subcommittees for not giving a
scheduled report.

Last week, Contact’s funds
were frozen until EC President
Bennett Ross spoke with one of
the two co-chairmen. This
week, the W&L Film Society’s
funds were frozen pending a
discussion with Ross.

Contact gave its belated
report and co-chairman Mike
Skardon reported that the atten-
dance at former Ambassador to
Poland William Schaufele’s
speech was mediocre but ‘‘sort
of what we expected.’’

Co-chairman Mike _Drink-

water explained that the pro

blems with publicity were due
to time constraints. The com
mittee was given only ten days
in which to prepare posters and
news releases.

‘“‘Contact is worthless to the
IFC if the publicity is limited to
the W&L community,”’ Ross
commented. Contact was

originally intended to be a ser-
vice project of the IFC which
would, theoretically, improve
the community’s view of frater-
nities.

Skardon and Drinkwater also
announced that the next
speaker would be Roger
Molander, author of ‘Ground
Zero.”’ Molander will speak in
Lee Chapel on Jan. 18.

When asked if the committee
had been working with the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty to bring speakers of interest
to the black community, Drink-
water replied that the commit-
tee had sent them a letter on
Nov. 1 and had not received a
reply.

Law Rep. Ken Terwilleger
suggested that the committee
call the president of the
organization but tempered his
suggestion with the comment,
“I don’t like the idea of babying
them.”

The Student Activities Board
ma its scheduled report and
Brett Kass comme nted that he
expected the ‘Tuesdays in the

Cockpit” program to improve
in the winter.

‘* ‘Tuesdays’ last fall wasn’t
as successful as the winter,”
Kass explained. Townsend Oast
added that the women’s col-
leges would not have as much
money to spend on their own
bands in the winter because of
the large number of parties held
during the fall.

John Haywood reported that
preparations for Fancy Dress
were ahead of schedule and that
six student artists were being
used.

In other business, the EC
adopted a letter to the faculty
EC that ‘‘strongly recommends
lowering the drop/add fee from
$10 to $5.”

“It’s a pretty hard line,”
Morgan Griffith, EC vice presi
dent, commented

‘‘T think it’s the proper line,”
Terwilleger responded.

Rick Swagler presented the
Ariel’s scheduled report and
told the committee that the
Ariel had spent $7.05 of its $1800
appropriation

Robert E. R. Huntley: A steady

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor-in-Chief

It was May 5, 1970, and ‘‘the hill” was
covered with students. The Ring-tum Phi
reported that 300 to 400 gathered for a 7:30
meeting in front of Lee Chapel to be
reminded of the U.S. bombing of Cam-
bodia and of the four students killed by the
national guard days earlier.

“Our purpose here tonight is not to burn,
but to build this university,’’ said an
organizer of the Strike Committee. ‘‘We
want to shut down the school so that all
students will be able to go up to Charlottes-
ville and learn a little something.”

The idea was for students to force the
faculty into ending the term without final
exams in order for students to participate
in Anti-war demonstrations, like the Jerry
Rubin rally planned at the University of
Virginia for May 6.

The president who stood up to address
his students at the meeting had only been
in office for two years. Robert Edward
Royall Huntley pleaded with the students
for calm.

“We must all attempt to walk the
tightrope between chaos, on one hand, and
streamlined efficiency on the other,” he
told them.

Huntley explained to them an open letter
he had written that day, attacking the
growth of “barriers’’ on campus, “‘bar-
riers behind which men retreat in intellec-
tual and moral isolation when they have
somehow convinced themselves of the in-
fallible correctness of their own views and
the base hypocrisy of all others... .”’

“Now is a time when Washington and
Lee should exhibit strength,’’ the open let-
ter concluded.

That was just the beginning of a long
week for the W&L community. A group of
30 students picketed the colonnade the next
morning at 8 a.m., leaving after a few
hours for the U.Va. rally. A student

referendum was held in which over 96 per-
cent of the undergraduates voted. Of them,
80.7 wanted to suspend classes for war
demonstrators.

The faculty was drifting toward the
“‘soft-shutdown.”’ But President Huntley
never let the issue come to a vote. He in-
formed a special faculty meeting that he
was under obligation to the Trustees and
the University’s charter to prevent the
University from closing down under such
conditions.

Instead, the faculty made up a proposal
allowing students to take a leave of
absense with an ‘Incomplete’ on their
report card. Work left undone in May
would have to be done by September.

A student strike was averted.

* * * * *

Back then the student body wore long
sideburns and an occasional protest arm-
band. Not so now. If the students of 1970
were possessed of ‘‘a deep conviction,
lightly held,’’ Huntley now jokes, ‘‘now it
may be the other way around.”’

But Huntley remains Huntley.

His first interview in The Ring-tum Phi
reads just like his last. As chief spokesman
for the Washington and Lee liberal educa-
tion, Huntley, 53, has always worked to
keep the school small. He turns skeptical
questions on those who would coeducate
the school or banish fraternities.

Huntley had so adroitly filled the office
of the president that the inevitable an-
nouncement of retirement caused disbelief
and dismay. “It is my personal view that
President Huntley has been the most
outstanding president of Washington and
Lee since Robert E. Lee,”’ the rector of the
trustees, James Ballengee, said in the
Alumni Magazine.

The announcement came less than two
weeks after Huntley told the Founder’s
Day convocation, Jan. 19, 1982, that W&L
had raised $67 million during the 10-year

development program that he spearhead-
ed

In his remarks to the faculty, Huntley
said, ‘‘When I became president, 14 years
ago this week, it seemed to me that a col-
lege president ought to set general objec-
tives he would like to see achieved over a
decade or so, and thereafter should step
aside. I believe that usually it is better for

a new person to lead the institution into the
next cycle of its life. . . .

“Quite simply, I feel I have been in the
job long enough.”’

Huntley now plans a vacation, after
which he will return to teach in the W&L
School of Law. He should be teaching on a

The
Cockpit

Editor:

I am writing in response to
Mr. Weissman’s letter of last
week concerning low atten-
dance at the Tuesday night con-
certs in the Cockpit. FACT:
Since the introduction last year
of these Tuesday night Cockpit
concerts, three out of seven
evenings each week can be con-
sidered quiet: Sunday, Monday,
and Thursday. Other evenings
are usually spiced with fraterni-
ty parties and other distrac-
tions. FACT: We all subsidize
the bands brought in on Tues-
day nights by the SAB, yet only
the students without pressing
academic requirements on
Wednesdays are able to go to
the concerts.

Mr. Darrell and the others
who originally selected Tues-
day night were looking for an
evening without conflicts. Is a
Wednesday Psychology exam a
good enough conflict? I hereby
suggest a solution, to be con-
sidered by the SAB and the EC:
when the already scheduled
bands have appeared, move the

Tuesday night concerts to
Fridays. Fraternities can still
schedule their parties for
Wednesdays and Saturdays,
and we will have a regular
weekend activity that even in-
dependents may enjoy.

Many students may have
missed bands they would have
liked to have seen because the
band performed on a Tuesday
night. I hope soon to see publish-
ed in the Phi a reply from the
SAB.

Experts meet in Maryland to discuss arms

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi Staff Writer

Experts representing both
pro and con_ viewpoints
presented their arguments on
nuclear armaments and the
present status of nuclear arms
negotiations at a conference of
editorial writers at the Univer-

sity of Maryland last week.
Officals from the Nixon,
Carter and Reagan administra-
tions as well as representatives
of the freeze movement inform-
ed the journalists on the inside
policies behind the SALT II
talks, the START talks and the
details of both the United States
and the Soviet Union’s present

arms arsenal.
Joseph D. Lehman, Public Af-
fairs Advisor of the United
States Arms Control and Disar-
mament Agency, spoke to the
group expaining the Reagan ad-
ministration’s policies. Lehman
was the principal U.S. spokes-
man at the opening of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Force Talks (INF) and also at
the Strategic Arms Limitations

Talks (SALT).

The Reagan administration
maintains a “no first strike
policy,” Lehman said, explain-
ing that the military will not
respond with nuclear defenses
to a warning of any kind
because of the _ possible
fratricidal cost of a mistake. He
said the policy states that the
U.S. will answer with nuclear
arms only when it is attacked
with nuclear arms.

He defended this policy ex-
plaining the current standing of
the “triad of deterrence’ in
which the U.S. maintains se-
cond strike capabilities on land,
with submarines and with air
launched nuclear arms. The
“dense pack,” (which the
House voted out of the Pentagon
budget on Tuesday) is designed
to fortify the ground leg of the
“triad.”’

This concept of a ‘‘triad’’ is
designed to limit the Soviet’s
ability to concentrate their
research on one of our defenses,
Lehman said.

Lehman attacked the nuclear

 

 

Freeze

(continued from page 1)
“‘But the question is not whether
it is sustainable but whether it
is defensible.”

The four panelists argued
back and forth over the eight
questions for two hours and
when they had finished the floor
was opened to the audience for
their own questions and com-
mentary. The emotion in the
crowd that had been suppressed
during the long debate surged
forward. More people in the au-
dience had statements to make
than had questions to ask.

“Anyone who says nuclear
war makes sense is a certifiable
idiot,’ proclaimed one man. A
self-styled expert on nuclear
issues, he went on to argue for-
cibly for the freeze.

Many of those who stood up to
make statements were older
men who recalled Pearl Harbor
and World War II. They remem-
bered the beginnings of the Cold
War in the early 50s and traced
its development through the
Vietnam War era into the 80s.
They do not like nuclear
weapons but they do not want a
weak America and fears of
Soviet aggression are strong in
their hearts.

‘“‘We are Americans, let us be
Americans,” said one man in a
speech of unbridled patriotism.

Another expressed anger at
Reagan’s charge last month
that freeze proponents are
“dupes” for communist pro-
paganda. Freeze proponents
are concerned Americans, not

communist dupes, he said.
Although strained with emo-
tion, their comments. were

_ logical and focused on estab-

lishing the facts. But the most
incisive question came from a
young, teen-age girl who, after
listening to all the legalistic
debate about rockets, technolo-
gy and negotiation, asked the
panel, ‘‘Aren’t you concerned
with the deaths of nuclear war
and human extinction?”’

It was a stunning question
from a young mind and the
clamoring crowd was silenced.
Her perspective on the issue
of nuclear weapons was neces-
sarily different from that of the
old men who remembered
World War II. She was not
preoccupied with history but
with the fate of future genera-
tions.

Annihilation of civilization,
the destruction of all human
achievement and the denial of
life to our yet to be born
children is a real risk of nuclear
weapons which few in the room
had recognized explicitly.

Referring directly to that
risk, the girl’s ingenuous ques-
tion exposed for a moment the
emotion that had subtly moti-
vated the anger and fear, uncer-
tainty and resolution of the au-
dience.

The panel replied quickly,
“Yes we are concerned and that
is why we are here,” as if it
were too obvious to take the
question seriously and they
moved on to other topics.

 

 

freeze movement, maintaining
that a freeze of the present
arms build-up in the U.S. would
leave an arsenal much older
and ineffective than the present
Soviet stockpile. He said that
three quarters of the U.S. arms
are 15 or more years old, com-
pared to the present Soviet
stock, three quarters of which is
five years old or less. -

This statement was later
criticized by the SALT II Chief
Negotiator, Paul Warnke, who
said that the Soviet SS18s and
SS19s, which make up a large
portion of their stock, are liquid
fueled and constantly deteri-
orating in reliability. In con-
trast, only the U.S. Trident
missiles, which are being phas-
ed out, are liquid fueled, War-
nke said.

Lehman also said that the
SALT II talks were largely inef-
fective in halting arms build-up
because they concentrated on
the improper common compo-
nent of both superpowers. The
SALT II talks, Lehman said,
were mainly concerned with the

number of missile launchers
that each country maintained.

Lehman explained that the
thinking behind this approach
was that when a missile was
launched it destroyed the laun-
cher and thus one missile would
be limited to one launcher.

But Lehman continued,
because reusable launchers
were later developed, the
Soviets added 2000 warheads to
their existing number, a move
not disallowed by the SALT II
agreements.

Warnke defended the SALT
talks, stating that if it was
ratified by Congress, it would
call for an immediate unilateral
decrease in nuclear arms of ten
percent.

Randall Forsberg, a chief
proponent of the nuclear freeze
movement and Director of the
Institute for Defense and Disar-
mament Studies, appeared
before the conference to argue
the case for an arms freeze.

Forsberg presented figures
contrary to President Reagan’s
recent statement that the U.S.

is behind the Soviets in the arms
race.

In contrast to Reagan,
Forsberg said that the U‘S.
nuclear submarine force is 20
years ahead of the Soviet force
and that the gap is widening in
favor of the U.S. Thus, she said
a nuclear arms freeze would be
the Soviet’s advantage.

Forsberg criticized the
START talks saying they are
focused on freezing the number
of nuclear arms at present but
do not address the question of
further technological research,
which she sees as potentially
more dangerous.

‘‘Arms control talks up until
now have not been about stopp-
ing arms build-up,’’ Forsberg
said.

She also said that with further
arms build-up by the super-
powers, the incentive for their
use also grows.

‘“‘Keeping the edge of the
sword sharper and sharper is a
plausible, but dangerous,
theory,” she said.

 

Easters

(continued from page 1)

from Roanoke. Trinkle’s com-
promise was three-fold: 1)
Fraternities be allowed to hold
Friday night parties which
would be ‘‘regulated,’’ 2) No
fraternity parties be held on
either Saturday or Sunday, and
3) a university-wide party take
place on Norris grounds on
Saturday night.

Kline said Trinkle’s offer was
not accepted because ‘‘a lot of
people felt it would not be suffi-
cient to eliminate the pro-
blems.”’ Trinkle commented;
“The major concern was that
anything we could do might not
alleviate the crowds. However,
I think that abolishing Easters
all in one year could potentially
cause some problems and dan-
gers. It would be better to slow-
ly phase it out until we hit a hap-
py medium.”

Trinkle sees two possible pro-
blems. First, he feels that the
crowds may still come
—Easters or no Easters — and
nobody will be prepared for
them. “‘It’s springtime, and
people are driving around and
visiting friends,”’ he said. Also,
he indicated there may be an in-
flux of fraternities into the
country to hold parties. Since U-
Hauls were outlawed following
the October accident that killed
two UVA students, the IFC has
been trying to ensure that
fraternities use buses for off-
grounds parties. But that will be
difficult, said Trinkle, ‘‘because
we can’t even say that it will be
a party weekend. I’m worried
about the safety factor.”’

Kline disagreed however,
saying that the three major
items of Easters — the tradi-
tion, the date in the spring, and

the fact that everything is held
out in the open — will all be
gone. ‘This does not preclude
fraternities from having parties
in the springtime,’ he said.
“But it’s not an Easters week-
end unless they say it is.

“The fraternity leaders have
been concerned about security.
The fraternities were victims of
Easters more than they were
benefactors. Many fraternity
presidents were relieved by the
decision. It has created big-
time problems. It’s a_ big
headache. The students enjoyed
the reputation more than the

partying.”

Members of the administra-
tion and student leaders will
now discuss how to regulate the
decision, according to Kline,
who said, “The fraternities are
not interested in protesting the
decision or having their own
Easters.”’

However, the following day, a
rally to save Easters attracted
400 to 500 students on the univer-
sity grounds according to
Trinkle. He said the event was
not sponsored by the IFC. “I
don’t agree with restrictions on
the social life of fraternities,”
said Trinkle. “If they are
outrageous, (the IFC will) start
having rallies and vehemently
opposing it.”’

Kline does not think the deci-
sion will have significant im-
pact at other universities.
“Every school has to look at its
own situation,” he said. ‘‘Some
have big parties with themes
and structures. It’s just party-
ing for partying sake. Not all
big weekends are the same.”’

One of the factors apparently
affecting the decision was a law
enacted by the Virginia General

Assembly that makes public
universities such as UVa liable
for personal injury or property
damage suffered at an event
like Easters.

The law, which went into ef-
fect July 1, does not directly af-
fect Washington and Lee,
according to Dean of Students
Lewis John; however, ‘‘we
would have potential liability
for accidents, hazards, or
dangers,” John said. ‘‘But Fan-
cy Dress is a different type of
event than Easters. We don’t
get big crowds and it is held in-
side.”’

In fact, ‘‘safety’’ was one
reason for moving the ball to
the gym from the cafeteria last
year, according to Dean John,
who called the abolition of
Easters a ‘‘necessary move.”’

Mason Ellerbe, W&L IFC
president, said he does not think
UVa’s decision will affect
Washington and Lee. When ask-
ed if the automobile accidents
this semester and the incident
at Zollman’s Pavilion, in which
the ABC broke up a party in Oc-
tober, would cause any changes
in the university’s current
system, Ellerbe said, ‘‘I don’t
see how we can prevent those
kinds of things which happen to
individuals who make errors or
bad judgments.”

However, John said, ‘“‘Some
of the things that student
organizations do in regard to
parties are going to have to be
different.”” He cited the fact
that there can be no more grain
parties at the Pavilion.

The U-Haul accident, coupled
with the new law, “opened up
the eyes of the administrators,
and they became aware of the
university’s liabilities,” said
Trinkle.

Lexington can be boring
even for a policeman

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

The car was weaving a bit
while traveling west on Jeffer-
son Street. Officer Jerry Knick
of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment decided to follow.

“‘He’s driving kind of funny,”
Knick said.

The car turned into a residen-
tial street and stopped in front
of a house. Lexington Mayor
and W&L economics professor
Charles Phillips got out of the
passenger side of the car and
waved at Officer Knick.

That was perhaps the most
exciting aspect of riding with
Officer Knick for two-and-a-half
hours on a recent Wednesday
night, as it turned out to be a
quiet evening.

Officer Knick, who has been
With the Lexington force for
about a year would work 16
hours that day (12-8 a.m. and
4-12 p.m.). He was one of four
men patrolling the Lexington
streets that evening, and though
he could offer no excitement, he
had some insight into the opera-
tion of the police department as
well as the new drunk driving
laws.

The new regulations, passed
by the Virginia General
Assembly last winter, call for
stricter administration of
justice against persons con-
victed of drunken driving. Ac-
cording to Knick, drunken driv-
ing is a Class One (the most
serious) misdemeanor and
could be punishable with up toa
$1000 fine, 12 months in jail and
six-month suspension of driv-
er’s license.

However, Knick indicated,
and court records back him up,
that the Lexington municipal
judge hae been giving first of-
fenders a $200 fine and suspend-
ing their license for six months.
This suspension will be revok-
ed, though, upon entry into the
Virginia Alcohol Safety Action
Program (VASAP). “But if the
judge knows your name, then
you’re in trouble,’’ Knick add-
ed.

However, the sentences
become increasingly stricter
for multiple offenses as a se-
cond offender (within five years
of the first offense) is required
to spend 48 hours in jail.

Knick feels that the new laws
are an ‘‘improvement,” and,
predictably, he doesn’t think
that people should mix drinking
and driving. “It’s just too
dangerous,”’ he said.

Suddenly the radar unit on the
floor of his car began beeping
unmercifully — an oncoming
car was going 46 miles per hour
in a 35 mph zone. But Officer
Knick paid no attention. ‘I nor-
maily give them 13 miles (over
the speed limit),’’ he said. ‘‘I’m
fairly generous. But some of the
others aren’t.”’

In fact, Officer Knick did not
write even a single ticket the en-
tire evening. Is that the norm?
“I haven’t written a ticket in
over a week,’’ Knick said. ‘‘The
ink in my pen is running dry.”’

Following a ‘“‘hair-raising”
chase; Knick did pull a van in
front of the Woods Creek Apart-
ments. Finally, an arrest for
drunken driving or at least
speeding. But no, it was not to
be. As the van pulled over to the
side of the road, Knick pointed
out that it had neither rear
lights nor brake lights.

Later, as Knick maneuvered
the squad car through a bad

suddenly came to life. “Unit

four, I need a 10-21 for a 10-25,”

said the dispatcher.
“Ten-four,”’ another officer
responded.

At last, a burglary or an acci-
dent or some such excitement.
No, explained Officer Knick,
that meant one of the other of-
ficers had received a phone
call, and he had to go to the sta-
tion to return the call.

“I wish something would hap-
pen,” Knick commented. “‘It
would break the monotony, at
least.’’

The evening was not entirely
dull, however. Moving north on

 

“It’s basically a boring job. But then

there are some times you wish it were

like that,’’ Officer Knick said.

 

section of town, he commented,
‘“‘They usually yell at us when
we drive through here.” Talk,
however, turned once again to
the subject of drunk driving.

Normally, Knick gets most of
his drunk drivers by arresting
them for a minor traffic of-
fense, such as running a red
light. Then, he can get an idea if
they are drunk by smelling
their breath or listening to
whether or not they are talking
clearly. |

If he suspects they are intox-
icated, he will administer the
usual tests such as walking a
straight line and touching a
finger to their nose. Knick also
has a field kit to give a general
idea of blood-alcohol content. It
consists of a test-tube ap-
paratus with a chemical inside.
If this chemical turns green
when the suspect blows into one
end of the tube, then Knick will
take him in to the police station.

“This test has never failed me
yet,” Knick said, indicating
that everyone he’s arrested
after using it has registered a
blood-alcohol content of .10 on
the breathalyzer at the station.
“Although I’ve never arrested
anyone who has had more than
three drinks.”” he added sar-
castically.

Once at the station, the officer
has to call a magistrate in to
bond the suspect and issue a for-
mal warrant for his arrest. Pro-
vided that the suspect is
reasonably cooperative, he will
be released when someone that
he knows comes to pick him up.
This is known as release upon
recognizance.

If the suspect can’t find
anybody to bail him out, he will
be kept in jail overnight. Of
course, all of this is dependent
on his showing up for a future
court date.

The radio, which had been
silent throughout the evening

Main Street, Knick spotted a
youth exiting the parking lot
beside White Column Inn. Ex-
plaining that there had been
some items stolen from cars
there and that this person ap-
peared to fit the description of
the suspect, who had been chas-
ed twice but not caught, Knick
turned around at the intersec-
tion of Main and Jefferson and
began slowly following the
youth on Henry Street with his
lights turned off. Finally, after
determining that the youth
didn’t have any contraband in
his possession, Knick sped past
him. ‘‘He was_ probably
scouting it out for later
tonight,”’ he said.

As the moon climbed higher
in the sky and Lexington be-
came deserted (‘‘It’s like a
ghost town,”’ Knick said at one
point) talk turned to the duties
of a police officer.

Knick said that although he
only schedules about one court
date every six to eight weeks,
there is still a tremendous
amount of paperwork involved.
Also, he indicated that begin-
ning the following day, the
department would be going onto
12-hour shifts, working four
days, and then having four days
off.

He also said that he
understood the police depart-
ment was planning to hire an in-
vestigator to take some of the
weight off the shoulders of the
policemen. After all, Knick
said, “It’s difficult to conduct
an investigation and ask people
questions when you are working
the graveyard shift.”

So how would Knick, a
military policeman before com-
ing to Lexington, sum up his
job?

“It’s basically boring,” he
eaid. ‘But then there are some
times you wish it were like
that.”’

(continued from page 2)

Power will officially change hands at
this year’s Founder’s Day convocation,
Jan. 19. Huntley’s successor is John D.
Wilson, vice president in charge of
academic affairs at Virginia Tech.

* * * *& *

The first time I really met President
Huntley was in the course of a story on the
suicide death of Gary H. Dobbs, a well-
loved biology professor.

Any death of that sort would be con-
troversial. This was even more so because
of Dobbs’ importance on campus. Dobbs
had been given a Ring-tum Phi award for
“epitomizing the Washington and Lee
gentleman,”’ and he had more advisees
than any of the pre-med professors.

The story was made doubly touchy
because Dobbs had stipulated in his will
that equipment he had donated to the
University would be withheld if W&L made
any ‘‘public announcement” about his
death.

In spite of all this, Huntley concealed
nothing. ‘‘I don’t think anything in the will
prohibits our answering questions,” he
said.

Huntley told of coming into his office to
find a ‘‘good-bye”’ letter from Dobbs in his
Christmas holiday mail, and of finding
Dobbs finally in his cabin-home.

“In every instance of death or serious il-
Iness, (Huntley) is a reassuring and real
presence,’’ said one administrator. ‘‘He is
senstitive to the kind of decisions familites
must make under such circumstances, and
he discreetly proffers his assistance and
that of others here as it might be welcom-
ed.”’

ee ee

It is not easy to get an interview with
Huntley, despite his attitude of coopera-
tion with the student press. As the school’s
master fundraiser, he is out of town a good
deal.

But the logistics worked out and I spoke
tohim recently for an hour.

How do you feel at the end of the $70
million campaign?

‘Well, I think it’s a damn good thing we
raised it,’’ he said, and burst out with a
gravelly laugh. ‘‘ ‘Cause we would have
sure been in trouble if we hadn’t.

“It’s very satisfying to know that the
school has that kind of vitality and
strength. It established a fair reason to be
optimistic about the school’s ability to
raise money in the future. . . .

“It took a great act of courage by the
board (of trustees) to acknowledge that
the need was that large and to put them-
selves on the line to make sure it got done.

“The $56 million originally announced
was perceived and stated to be the
minimum amount. Nobody believed it was
the minimum amount but it was. We ac-
tually had to raise 67, to get the same thing
done we thought 56 would do. Inflation was
higher than we expected.’

The moneyraising was needed to finance
development on campus that included a
new undergraduate library, an overhauled
School of Commerce, and a renovated
Graham-Lees dormitory, to name the
most obvious projects.

Huntley’s fundraising efforts keep him
in close contact with alumni and trustees
(though that’s certainly not the only
reason for contact). The board of trustees
meets three times year, mostly on cam-
pus. Huntley, as a trustee, attends these
meetings as well as meetings of trustee
committees, where a lot of the work is
done.

“(The trustees) are an amazing bunch.
They’re very hard-working, successful
people, with a lot of other things to do, but
they give the school a very high priority in
their lives,’’ Huntley said.

Although Huntley said he doesn’t have
“any powers to dictate to the trustees,”
sources say he has been instrumental in
energizing the board with younger,
talented new members.

In addition to the trustees, college
presidents add to the heady intellectual
circles that Huntley moves in. ‘The
presidents I see most of, besides those in
the state, are the presidents of Williams
and Swarthmore and Davidson, Grinnell
and Carlton, . . . Occidental, Colorado Col-
lege. .

“Those are the ones I see most of and
talk about comparable situations and pro-
blems with.”

He rounds out the list of friends with
alumni, like Roger Mudd, the NBC News
anchorman who was a brother Delt with
Huntley in the early ’50s.

I get calls from Roger every once in a
while, but not about the nightly news. No,
we’re good friends and we have the kind of
communications that good friends would
have.”

Are college friendships the ones that
last?

“Well, they certainly have been with me.
That’s true. But then you have to bear in
mind that I never really left here for very
long. I was in the Navy four years, went off

to Harvard for a year, and then practiced
law for a year.

“With those exceptions, I’ve been here
since I was 16!!! All of my friendships are
college friendships !”’

A graduate of Washington and Lee, and
W&L Law, Huntley returned in the ’60s to
teach in the law school.

Huntley became secretary of the board
of trustees, and said he had no idea that the
position would lead him into the role of
president. But the position allowed him to
meet and befriend many trustees.

When it was time to pick a new president
in 1968, no one was in a better position than
Huntley. The selection process was much
more limited for Huntley than for the new
president, Wilson, said Frank Parsons,
assistant to the president.

* * * Ok

In the interview, Huntley said the ques-
tion of coeducation was still open for study
by the trustees, and would continue to be.
But he himself seemed skeptical.

‘Almost all of the schools that were all
male and became coeducational (in the
70s), and that I know anything about,
became larger by a factor of 30 to 100 per-
cent, within a matter of three or four or
five years. If that had happened to us in
those days it would have been difficult,
educationally and financially.

And size is the key consideration for
Huntley.

“It’s like the old Mutt and Jeff cartoon:
If you sell silver dollars for 50*, you don’t
make more money by selling more of
them.”’ :

What about the controversial (at least
with the faculty) question of fraternities?

“You have to imagine the alternative
before you know whether or not you’re go-
ing to like it better, and also you're going
to have to ask the question whether you
can create the alternative,” he said.

“I doubt if the need that people feel to
get together in groups smaller than 1500 or
1350 is going to go away.”’ The small
student body allows “for some sense of
community, but it doesn’t mean that you

fellowship with each person relating to
each other person in the same way. Just to
state that reveals that it’s nonsense.”’

Huntley denied that the housing and
feeding done by fraternities is a major con-
sideration. So why does the university sub-
sidize fraternities with low-interest loans?

“To a degree, the university will need to
concern itself, under any system, with the
facilitation of these social subgroups. You
can’t just deny their existence.

“You'll notice there are loans to non
fraternity subgroups, too,’’ Huntley said,
refering to the Lampost Christian House
and the International House.

* * * * *

One administrator has said that Huntley
has a way of making a prospective donor
appreciate the importance of his or her gift
to himself or herself. Even faculty
members who hope that money will not be
the prime concern of the incoming presi-
dent acknowledge that Huntley’s skill with
donors provided the university with a
sense of financial security in times of na-
tional financial insecurity.

There is a story, which Huntley confirm-
ed, which shows the Huntley charm in ac-
tion. He had been given a check for $10,000
at some alumni gathering, which he put in
his sock drawer for safe keeping. And then
forgot about.

When he couldn’t find the check, the
donor sent another check for the same
amount. But meanwhile, Mrs. Evelyn
Huntley found the first check.

So Huntley called the donor, with the old
check, and the newly arrived second
check, in front of him.

‘““Great, you found it,’ said the donor.
“‘Now you can tear up the second check.”

‘‘Well, that’s not what I had in mind, ex-
actly,’’ Huntley responded, and proceeded
to sweettalk the donor into a $20,000 dona-
tion.

* * * *

In the first interview with president
Huntley in 1969, someone said, ‘‘When you
retire, some reporter is going to ask you
what your proudest achievement as presi-
dent was. What do you think you will say?”

The answer was quick and eloquent, and
would stand as a changeless definition of
Washington and Lee. The same message
reverberates through commencement
speeches and interviews throughout
Huntley’s 14-year tenure:

“T would hope to be able to say that
Washington and Lee has fulfilled its
history as a unique higher educational in-
stitution, with continuing emphasis on the
liberal arts, with student body and faculty
drawn from all walks of life; and from
across the country, strongly motivated
young men who represent a cross-section
of society; and highly qualified faculty
members who are primarily motivated to
teach young men, with interest in research
and independent scholastic improvement
in their thinking, but secondary in their

 

 

can expect that all 1350 will be one grand motivation.”

A Journal of Interdisciplinary Thought

 

 

 

Focus: Where is it going? Where has it been?

Focus, the Interdisciplinary
Symposium, is a creature of the
1981 University Council. It was
originally given the name of the
Washington and Lee Intellec-
tual Symposium, but that name
was changed due to the objec-
tions of several people. In this
issue of the Excelsior, Focus’
Journal of Interdisciplinary
Thought, we present the
original White Paper of the 1981
University Council on the sub-
ject of what was then called the
Intellectual Symposium. In so
doing, we hope to educate the
W&L Community about the
great potential Focus has. This
white paper envisions great
things. Although the organiza-
tion’s name has changed, the
dreams and goals presented in
this white paper remain.

The current Focus committee
has no intention of living up to
all these goals in one year. In
fact, we have some very limited
objectives for this year. These
objectives, however, envision
working towards the goals of
the white paper, while realizing
they cannot all be achieved at
once. What are the objectives of
Focus in 1982-1983?

1. To publish three issues of
the Excelsior, one for each term.

2. To hold a mini-symposium
on Saturday April 23, 1983. Our
chosen topic is technology. We
hope to share a speaker with
Contact on that day. Hopefully,
that speaker will be Con-
gressman Newt Ginrich, an
acknowledged expert on the
topic. The price for this speaker
would be approximately half
that of most other speakers, so

that it would not cost Contact
very much. In addition, we
want to publish an issue of
Excelsior on Thursday April 21
that would be devoted solely to
the topic of technology. Some

possible articles would be: the
moral aspects of genetic
engineering, political aspects of
advances in military technolo-
gy, business aspects of the new
technological revolution, pro-

jected advances in medicine
and cancer research, etc. The
list could go on and on. It is ob-
vious from this brief list of
possible topics that the ap-
proach would truly be inter-

The report that got Focus started

Report of the Committee
Brainstorming the Feasibility
of a Quadrennial Intellectual
Symposium at Washington and
Lee University.
April 28, 1981
Background

At its meeting on February
25, the Univeraity Council by a
unanimous vote asked the Coun-
cil chairmen to appoint a com-
mittee to investigate the
possibility of an intellectual
symposium or convocation (a
university-wide consideration
of a critical public issue
culminating in a town meeting,
a white paper, and a competi-
tion) as proposed by the ad hoc
Committee on Liberal Educa-
tion.

Before taking further action
(such as asking the Student
Body Executive Committee to
appoint chairmen and a steer-
ing committee), the Council
wished to have a representative
committee brainstorm the pro-
posal to evaluate its feasibility
and; if it were thought to be
feasible, to make suggestions or
recommendations as to format,
structure, and possible topics.
The Council’s intent, however,
was not to limit the committee
in any way in the range of its
considerations.

The committee was compos-
ed of nine members, three
faculty members, one adminis-
trator, and five students. One
faculty member asked to be
dropped from the committee
because of schedule conflicts
and illness. The members were
present or former members of
the University Council or the
Executive Committee, or mem-
bers of the ad hoc Committee on
Liberal Education (including
the person who made the
original proposal), or persons
with experience in activities
similar to the one proposed.

Methodology

The committee met on four
occasions (March 19, March 25,
April 21, and April 23) with ex-
cellent attendance at each
meeting. Brainstorming and
discussion was the primary
focus. No formal votes were
taken, but the committee was
very positive and found the pro-
posal interesting and appealing.

The report, which was ap-
proved without dissent, is divid-
ed into areas which the Univer-
sity Council might wish to con-
sider before taking further ac-
tion on the proposal: goals and
objectives, problems and disad-
vantages, operation, structure,
format, and possible topics

(with an outline of one par-
ticular topic).
Goals, Objectives, Advantages

An intellectual symposium of
the type suggested would serve
several functions and have
many merits.

1. It could help unify the cam-
pus. Academic, housing, and
social units fracture the cam-
pus. An intellectual symposium
could bring together the various
departments, disciplines, in-
terests, and groups in a com-
mon pursuit.

2. Interdisciplinary learning
needs to take place, and an in-
tellectual symposium could pro-
vide an opportunity. It is impor-
tant to look at problems from
several different areas, but
there are relatively few inter-
disciplinary courses.

3. Critical thinking would be
encouraged. Students and facul-
ty members would have a
chance to look at issues from
several different perspectives.
There would be additional op-
portunities to review and judge
ideas.

4. It could demonstrate that
liberal education takes place
outside of the classroom as well
as inside.

(continued on page 10)

disciplinary. This issue of
Excelsior would, we hope, draw
a lot of interest to the upcoming
speaker and thus would benefit
Contact as well. At the mini-
symposium, we hope to have
displays and literature from top
corporations and/or the govern-
ment on new advances in tech-
nology. If feasible, we may
have some debates, seminars
and lectures concurrent with
these displays and the speaker.

3. To recuit members for the
Focus Committee. As most of
the work for the committee is
now being done by one or two
people and, as these people are
currently seniors, the need for
new members is crucial.

4. To begin thinking and plan-
ning for a full-scale Inter-
disciplinary Symposium in the
spring of 1986. Such a sym-
posium would be on the scale
envisioned by the white paper
mentioned above.

What is Focus trying to do? It
is trying to invigorate the in-
tellectual climate on campus. It
is, through its journal Excelsior,
trying to prevent myopia resul-
tant from too much absorption
in one discipline. Focus wants
to make the W&L community
proud of its talents for thinking.
It is more than another group
sponsoring speakers — it is an
integrated concept. Excelsior is
more than an offshoot of the
Political Review — it is a multi-
and inter-disciplinary journal.
Please give Focus and Excelsior
your support.

Imagination in Art

By CHRISTOPHER C.
BOUQUET

Imagination “rouses’”' man
beyond himself to cosmology.
Man steps out of the cramped
room of reality onto a vast,
universal plane. Imagination
leads man to see the flux of
alternate realities. There are
many worlds twirling on the
plane. Ghosts from past and
future meet. The souls of tantric
lovers entwine in gaseous em-
brace. The spaceship in Gurd-
jieff’s Beelzebub’s Tales to His
Grandson really flies.

Why does it fly? Of what use
is the imagination? Moody’s
Bond Survey, while useful, can-
not be the Bible of an investor
who has stepped out onto a
universal plane. Imagination
broadens. The investor grasps
that there are worlds beyond
Wall Street, beyond, even, this
world. He becomes part of
something greater than him-
self. By using his imagination,
the investor grows.

Art helps man to see the im-
agination that is within. Art, an
impulse against mortality,
pushes man towards where
mortality is unimportant:

Here the impossible union

Of spheres of existence is ac-
tual,

Here the past and future

Are conquered, and reconcil-

ed.?
Art pushes man towards the
songs of angels. Music by Bach,
however, is not the song of
angels. His music, like all art, is
an arrow shot towards the sun.
G. says, ‘‘The secret of crossing
from one river of life to the
other is...to draw gross matter
back inside, transform it into its
independent arising as fine
matter, and then to direct it
back towards its place of origin,
the Sun - Absolute.’’* An artist’s
imagination, through his medi-
um, ‘transforms’ this “gross
matter’”’ into a. “‘revelation.’”*
The “revelation’”® is a bow
towards objective truth, an
acknowledgement of the es-
sence of things, the ‘‘fine mat-
ter.’"° Thus, a thing “has
aesthetic and veristic signifi-
cance beyond its generic identi-
ty or function.”"' The imagina-
tion, the, the mind, leads the ar-
tist to work with his raw
materials, through his medium,
towards objective reality. Eliot
bids the artist, ‘‘Not fare well,
but fare forward, voyagers.’’”
Of what value is this voyage to
the non-artist, the appreciator
of art? Art, and its accompany-
ing aesthetics, ‘‘certain
evidences of exertions to find
the truth,’’"* shatter illusionistic
notions of reality. The man in
the street, through an under-
standing of art, sees the ‘fine
matter’’'* that the artist
presents through his medium.
Moody’s Bond Survey and the
world of traffic jams no longer
have a vice-like grip on the
populace.

Out of the vice-like world of
World War One came these
monumental words, ‘‘zimzim
urallala zimzim zanzibar
zimlalla zam.’’ It was Hugo

Ball. He and the Dadaists were
shattering the illusions of the
reality of the nineteen teens.'*
They were anarchic Turks on a
particularly wild voyage. Their
end, however, justified their
means. They, like all artists,
were seeing ‘‘the human end in
the spirit’s greatest reach.’
The Dadaists sought ‘some
common denominator belong-
ing to both the lowest and the
highest forms of animals and
plants.’’"* It was not easy to
achieve such ethereal goals in
the world of trench warfare and
mustard gas. Thus, they needed
some outrageous tactics.

Hugo Ball’s words without
meaning were an_ outrage.
Perhaps they reflected the
meaninglessness of European
society and the value of the
poet’s medium to sound words
into music that reaches toward
Eliot’s ‘impossible union.’’”
Duchamp’s Fountain, also an
outrage, made a crucial point
about art. It was the artist’s in-
ward focus, his imagination,
that mattered. If the artist
chose a urinal as a piece of art,
that was his prerogative. Wil-
liams, afterall, in ‘‘Between the
Walls,” makes broken glass in-
to art. Anything could be art if
chosen by the artist and,
through his _ imagination,

“transformed into fine mat-

ter.’’2

Surrealism, building on
Dadaism, underlined the im-
agination. The surrealists
seemed to by saying ‘‘Please do
not forget there are other
worlds besides this one.”” What
was their ultimate goal? It was,
as Arnason says, ‘‘...a moment
of revelation in which are
resolved the contradictions of
dreams and realities,”’*! Once
again, the imagination pushes
the artist, through his medium,
towards an objective reality
where all things are one and
contradictions do not exist.

Max Ernst’s The Horde, like
many surrealist paintings,
evokes dreams. The artist’s im-
agination, through his materi-
als, reveals ‘‘ghostlier demar-
cations.”’** Ernst uses frottage,
making random sketches of tex-
ture*® and arranging these so
that the result is “fine mat-
ter.’’** This emphasis on
chance, also seen in Dadaism,
shows the elusiveness of the ar-
tist’s object of desire. He cannot
reach the sun. His art is ‘“‘objec-
tive prayer.’’** He snatches at
the disparate elements of reali-
ty, trying to fuse them into a
single artistic arrow. In the pro-
cess, he evokes dream-like
figures, horrible, haunting,

moving across the canvas. Is -

this Stevens’ ‘‘migratory pass-
ing’’ between reality and other
worlds? This man knows the
truth lies somewhere between
this world and the next:
somewhere on the universal
plane, where contradictions are
resolved. ‘‘The way up is the
way down,”’?’ says Eliot.

The way up is toward the
songs of angels. The way down
is towards the individual and
his imagination... There is no

way to express the ‘impossible
union’’* of these two paths. Yet,
the artist must try. “That risk/
is all there is.’’** His art is all he

has:

... The actor is

A metaphysician in the dark,
twanging

An instrument, twanging a
wiry string that gives

Sounds passing through sud-
den rightnesses**

These sounds, however, are not
the truth. They come from the
artist. Stevens says, ‘‘...it was
she and not the sea we heard.’’*!
Where surrealism underlines
other worlds, abstract expres-
sionism underlines the artist’s
role. Imagination is crucial in
both. The painter looks deep
within himself. This inward
turn is reflected in new ap-
proaches to the canvas. Paint is
allowed to seep deep into the
canvas. The canvas is not prim-
ed. Artists, like Jackson
Pollock, become more a part of
their composition. Pollock laid
his canvas on the floor ‘“‘since
this way I can walk around it,
work from four sides and
literally be in the painting.’’**

William deKooning’s ... Whose
Name Was Writ in Water is an in-
tensely personal piece of art. It
has no basis in physical reality.
It is an expression of the artist’s
feelings. The artist’s imagina-
tion launches these feelings
toward a complex of universal
feeling. He does this with red
and blue lines on a background
of white. Arnason suggests that
there is violence in these lines.**
It seems almost like the
violence of a man’s will to live.
Perhaps deKooning was listen-
ing to Dylan Thomas’ words:
“Rage, rage against the dying
of the light.’’** The white sug-
gests water, the inexorable flow
of time. The blues and reds and
black suggest the rage of the ar-
tist.

All artists “rage against the
dying of the light.’’** Charles
Olson, the poet, grasps that his
breathing will stop. Yet, he uses
his breath; in his poetry, to
‘“‘push’”” towards a universal
which is present for all time and
is outside of time. Man is an
animal. Part of the attention
focused inward should be on the
breath. Breath is an internal
characteristic that man shares
with other animals and plants.
Man turns inward, not to spew
forth his person, but as a ‘‘par-
ticipant in the larger force.’’™

He learns “secrets objects
share.’’*
Does he learn just by listening

to his breath? The answer is no.
He must employ his imagina-
tion, his mind. The poem is a
work of the mind, not a gusher
of feeling. Stevens says that the
modern poem is ‘“‘The poem of
the mind in the act of finding
what will suffice.’ It relates to
the reader by going towards
that ‘‘thing’”’ that is universal in
each person. It is the imagina-
tion which sparks the search.
The poet’s medium allows the
search. To Olson, the syllable
and the line are primary ele-

ments of the medium. ‘‘The two
halves are: the head, by way of

the ear, to the syllable/ the

heart, by way of the breath, to
the line.’’*' The ‘dance of the in-
tellect’’*? is in the syllable.” And
the threshing floor for the
dance? Is it anything but the
line?” Is it not on the
“threshing floor’’* of reality
that imagination and art play
themselves out?

The syllables are the ‘‘play’’**
of the imagination. Yet, the
sound of the poem is the sound
of the guitar in Stevens’ ‘‘Man
With the Blue Guitar:’’

And they said then, ‘But play
you must

A tune beyond us, yet
ourselves,

A tune upon the bive guitar

Of things exactly as they
are’’’*6
This tune however, can never
express “‘things exactly as they
are.”*7 “The man_ replied,
‘Things as they are/ Are chang-
ed upon the blue guitar?’ ’’

Truth is an _ inexpressible
silence, except to the angels.
Nemerov says, ‘‘Both poets and
painters want to reach the
silence behind the language, the
silence within the language.’’”
Creeley substantiates this.

He pushes behind the Words

Which, awkward, catch

and turn him toa disturbed

and fumbling man.*°
St. John of the Cross’ ‘dark
night’’** resembles Creeley’s
dilemma. St. John says, ‘“‘...this
darkness and these trials, both
spiritual and temporal...are so
numerous and so profound that
neither does human knowledge
suffice for the understanding of
them, nor experience for the
description of them, for only he
that passes this way can
understand it, and even he can-
not describe it.’’** Stevens’
pigeons “sink/ Downward to
darkness.’’** At least they make
the flight.

All artists follow the pigeons
‘downward to darkness’’** (or
up towards the sun.) Just as
Polleck was ‘‘in’ his painting; **
so too is the poet in his poem.
The poet’s energy charges the
poem: he is a part of it as he is a
part of a universal. He realizes
his position in a grander
cosmology of the poem; in the
same way as the tools of the
painter are part of the grander
cosmology of the picture. '

Confusion reigns
on Wall Street

by TOM ROHRIG

Back in the lazy, hazy days of
summer — August 17 to be ex-
act —- Mr. Kaufmann, Salomon
Brothers’ Chief Economist,
predicted lower short-term and
long-term interest rates. This
was enough to send Wall Street
buzzing to a new era of trading
volume and eventually, to an all
time high for the Dow Jones In-
dustrial Average. At the time of
Mr. Kaufmann’s switch to a
‘‘bull,”’ the descent in interest
had already begun, yet the
Prime rate was between
14.0-14.5% and the Discount rate
was hovering at 11.0%. The
Fed, by lowering the discount
rate, was purposively trying to
help out the sagging economy.
Indirectly, it mostly benefitted
the brokerage houses, the small
investors, and the portfolio
managers who continue to reap
the benefits to this day. Volume
on the Big Board soared to
astronomical levels, with the
record daily trading volume
now standing at 149,700,000
shares — a big leap from the
once heavy 70,000,000 shares.
With this increased volume and
the new bullish outlook, the In-
dustrial Average surged from
780 in mid-August to 1065 on
November 3 — a new all time
high. In fact, the advisers at
Dow Theory Forecasts, (along
with many others), expect the
Dow to reach the 2000 level and
to even stretch beyond that.

Yet when I focus on this re-
cent advance in the Dow, I can’t
help but notice that when the
Fed acts the investors follow, or
more recently, when the Fed
doesn’t act the investors run
scared. So I question, ‘‘Why are
the investors so stuck on the ac-
tions of the Fed?” Don’t the in-
vestors watch, or for that mat-
ter, care about, how the

economy is doing? I just hope

that the investors’ castle is not
built on quick sand.

The journalist and his sources

By FRANK JACKMAN

To a reporter, maintaining
the confidence of his various
sources may be imperative if he
is to remain effective.
Sometimes this means conceal-
ing the identity of a news or in-
formation source in the face of
subpoenas, grand jury question-
ing and possible jail sentences.
But are shield laws protecting
the journalist from punishment
for refusing to name his sources
really necessary? And who are
they designed to protect, the
source or the reporter?

It seems to me that far too
many journalists promise an-
nonymity to far too many
sources when it is really un-
necessary. Blanket promises of

Looking at the economy, all

' that I can sense is pure uncer-

tainity. Unemployment is at its
highest level since 1937, with the
current level being 10.4 percent.
And if you’re a Keynesian you
believe that consumer spending
will get us out of the mess we’re
in—but there are at least 10.4
percent of us who have nothing
to spend and this disregards
those who have given up the job
search and those that are bare-
ly making ends meet. On the
other side, inflation is now be-
ing held stable at around 5 per-
cent and this is good news to all,
especially to Ronnie. With
lower prices on such necessities
as food stuffs and gasoline,
those with money are now able
to hold onto it for a little longer.
Also, because of the lower in-
terest rates farmers hard press-
ed for cash can now borrow
money from a lending institu-
tion to order that they may buy
their spring seed. And, in-
novative entrepreneurs, com-
panies willing to expand, and
consumers in the market for a
new car are able to borrow
funds that carry lower interest
expenses. It is up to these
groups to move now in order for
industrial production to pick up,
thus resulting in many workers
being recalled.

Large companies who are
currently financially strapped
are redeeming old debt securi-
ties that carried the much
higher rates and replacing
them with new issues that are
now paying the lower rates.
This not only cuts down ex-
penses, but also makes finan-
cial statements look healthier.

So right now we are in a
waiting period — looking for
some sign of the direction the
economy is going. The laid-off
auto worker is waiting for new
car Sales to increase, investors
and brokers alike are waiting
for the next move by the Fed,
and the Democrats are waiting
for 1984!

annonymity or even partial pro-
mises should be the exception,
not the rule. Such promises
should be made in only extreme
circumstances when the life,
family or livlihood of the source
may be endangered for giving
information to a_ reporter.
Otherwise, the reporter should
carefully weigh the value of the
information against the de-
mands of the source before
making any promises. The
fewer times such promises are
made the more credible they
will appear to the public and the
courts when they are made. It
would be like the boy crying
wolf all the time, when the time
is really right to cry wolf
nobody will believe him
anymore.

 

By FRANK JACKMAN

I don’t think that too many
people would argue with the
contention that the respon-
sibilities of the press have
grown greater in the past
several decades. With the rapid
growth of technology and the
ever increasing glut of informa-
tion people of the world ‘‘socie-
ty’? have become more depen-
dent on the press than ever
before, as was pointed out in the
Hudgens’ report. And as the
report states, it is time for the
press to assume this respon-
sibility. If it is true that the
press has ‘“‘become a vital ne-
cessity...in the transaction of
public business’’ then the
responsibility of the press, I
think, as do others, can be said
to be at least two-fold.

First, the press through the
various media outlets must
disseminate news and informa-
tion in a clear and unbiased way
and in such a manner that the
public can relate it to the con-
text of the news day and the sur-
rounding environment. News
and information would seem to
me to be easier to assimilate
when put into perspective for

Also, shield laws could help to
promote abuses of the system
within the field of journalism
itself. Reporters who know they
can get away with fabricating a
story because they know that
they will never have to produce
their mythical source of infor-
mation are more likely to try to
get away with it. The trust plac-
ed in journalists by the public to
tell the truth would be severely
damaged by a series of ques-
tionable stories. Without this
trust, the ability of the jour-
nalist to perform his duties to
the public would be severely in-
hibited for the simple reason
that people would be wary of
what the journalist had to say
after a while. The integrity of
the field of journalism cannot

The press in a changing world

the public. While this may be
easier said than done, I don’t
think that it is impossible.
Great care should be taken
though in attempting to do this.
If, as the Hudgens’ report main-
tains, it is no longer enough to
“report the facts truthfully”’
then the objectivity of the press
may be compromised in order
to “report the truth about the
facts.”

Secondly, the press and its
outlets must provide an open
forum for public discussion of
ideas and issues pertaining to
our society. It is essential that
all the points of view are heard
and that the public is given the
opportunity to freely discuss
these views and judge their
relative merits and faults. The
public must be exposed to more
than just the viewpoints of those
who control the press or the
danger of stagnation sets in. A
free society cannot afford to ig-
nore any side of an issue. As the
Hudgens’ report points out, the
press has the responsibility of
presenting all sides of an issue
or topic for public debate.

The type of media outlet
should not determine what is

afford to be compromised. The
public perception of the
reporter directly affects the
faith that they are willing to put
in what he has to say.

One may argue then that if
the lawyer-client relationship
and the doctor-patient relation-
ship are similarly protected
then why isn’t the reporter-
source relationship, As we
discussed in class, the primary
reason for this is that the ap-
propriate laws protect the client
and the patient in such cases. In
the case of the journalist it is
the journalist that is protected
in such instances and only in-
directly is the source protected.
In other words, shield laws are
designed to prevent the report-
er from going to jail not the

presented and what isn’t. All
media outlets have the respon-
sibility, as far as is technically
feasible, to present all view-
points possible that exist in our
society. Due to the technical
problems or aspects indigenous
to each outlet the responsibility
may have to be altered to fit the
format but not to change the
content.

We should consider one final
question. Who has the right to
determine the responsibilities
outlined above as well as those
that have been left out because
of space restrictions? I contend
that it is the duty of the press
itself and the right of the public
to decide on the responsibilities
of the press and the function it
should perform in society. If the
government is allowed to dic-

_ tate the responsibilities of the

press, even baeed on the above
criteria, then the possibility will
always exist for the com-
promise of First Amendment
rights. While this may not seem
relevant to this discussion, I
think it is because it is another
responsibility of the press to see
that its ability to keep the public
informed is not impeded by
anyone or anything.

source, except in special cases.
Without the protection of shield
laws it seems to me that a jour-
nalist may be less likely to pro-
mise annonymity except in
special cases. In a way the
possibility of a jail sentence
serves to keep the reporter
honest.

Finally, why invite govern-
mental interference when it is
not really necessary? This
seems to me to be asking for
trouble when there is already
enough to go around. To a
public that constantly hears the
journalist screaming about in-
dependence from the govern-
ment asking the government to
come in and regulate even a
single aspect of the trade may
appear inconsistent and fickle.

Who is the journalist accountable to?

By STEVE WARREN
On most

readers and viewers, I find
myself befuddled.
Do we, as students of a

‘profession,

merely ‘“‘submitting’’ to the one
sure-fire object of accountabili-
ty, The Boss? As students, we
can foster ideals, make true our
aim, but for the most part, we
also must realize the impor-
tance of temporary silence as a
means of survival. The bottom
line, it seems, is the reality that
every media outlet will want
newcomers to conform to their
particular ‘‘flavor’’ of news. In
a tough job market, it’s not so
easy for an unemployed jour-
nalist to maintain integrity

5. An intellectual symposium
would provide additional oppor-
tunities for and encourage par-
ticipation in seminars and in-
dividualized research projects
and courses.

6. It could rejuvenate the
spring term. The spring term
was designed to allow students
to participate in research and
special projects that would not
normally be offered during the
regular fall and winter terms: It
has been observed that during
the spring term intellectual life
at W&L tends to slow down;
there are few speakers or
special events. An intellectual
symposium would provide addi-
tional academic and intellec-
tual opportunities.

7. It could guide academic or
career objectives for students.
Such a program would expose
participants to many different
subjects and could encourage
further study and interest. It
would also illustrate how a
liberal arts education relates to
practical problems.

8. It would allow students to
have a leadership role that they
might otherwise miss. One ex-
cellent feature of the Mock Con-
vention is that it involves a very
large percentage of the student
body with many students taking
on various responsibilities. An
intellectual symposium would
bring additional opportunities
for students and allow them to
become involved in an organi-
zation that would not demand a
long-term commitment.

9. An intellectual symposium
would add a distinctive feature
to academic and student life at
Washington and Lee, much as
the Mock Convention does.

The committee agreed that
the above list is by no means ex-
haustive.

Problems and Disadvantages

analytical
assignments, I can put myself
in a position to make a state-
ment of some type, but in trying
to say anything about the ac-
countability of the press to their

“vocation,’’ or
“craft” have any other way out
of this tangle, from that of

when faced with the options. So,
it is the boss to whom the jour-
nalist is immediately accounta-
ble; but it is to himself that he is
accountable in the long run.
Thus, the burden of such an
abstract moral principle rests
mainly with the individual, over
the long run, if he is to live with
himself; and itis also that of the
employer, in the long run, to ef-
fectively deal with a grander
sense of accountability — a
“‘responsibility’’ to The Public.
I’m not sure where I stand on
the various methods of account-
ability...there seems little to
say about the tried mechan-
isms, such as ‘‘Reporter
Power’’ (where journalists’ cor-
porations are formed at an
outlet to pool capital, thus own-
ing a majority interest in the
paper they serve) or unions
(where no dramatic work has
taken place other than to take of
immediate, individual in-
terests...salaries, talent fees,

and job security), or om-
budsmen/women (where only
the daily-circulation-of-over-
100,000 newspapers hire real
“‘thinkers’’ who will remind the
editors of ethical considera-
tions),... or some sort of profes-
sional organization that would
serve as a common forum for
standards. But many consider
these a threat to Free Speech.

Press Councils in the United
States have been slow to take
hold, when compared to other
countries. Sweden, for exam-
ple, had formed a national press
council as early as 1916. Britain
created one in 1952 to in-
depentently monitor the perfor-
mance of the news media, as
well as to investigate com-
plaints brought by the public or
government. It wasn’t until the
1960’s that the idea caught on in
the U.S., and even then it was on
a local level. In 1973, a National
News Council was established
in New York.'

The idea of a council is to mix
members of the trade with
members of the public, to ham-
mer out common ideals that
each can expect of the other. To
me, it would make little sense to
appropriate councils any more
power than that, little as it may
seem. The idea is to foster re-
sponsibility among individuals,
rather than to serve as ex-
aminers of worthinesss, as one
could view the Bar Associa-
tions. How do you provide in-
centive for an individual to ‘‘act
responsibly’’? Western tenden-
cy is to hold some object of
desire over the individual, so I
suppose a council could deny
membership to those deemed
“‘irresponsible,”’ but again, that
would be to assign worthiness,
and that would impinge upon
free speech.

I submit that this is a case
where virtue must be its own
reward. Members should not be
able to apply for member-

ship...instead, they could be
elected by their peers who are
not yet members, so that even
the organization itself could not
exercise self-indoctrination.
And the criteria to base mem-
bership upon could come from
the Council, in fact it should
come from that pool of resourc-
es...but membership would
have to be based on outsiders’
estimation of how well an in-
dividual lives up to the profes-
sional standards. Again, this is
to set up a group where mem-
bership is strived for, and at-
tained on the basis of merit,
rather than a group set up to
remonstrate ousiders, with
membership based on politics
and credential padding.

It may not be the type of thing
to change our problems over-
night, but I would think it could
be a step in the right direction.

‘‘Media,’’ Prentice-Hall

(1976) p.82.

 

While recognizing the many
advantages such a program
would have, the committee also
found several problems and
disadvantages.

1. Sustaining interest in one
idea for an extended period of
time could be difficult. The
Mock Convention has the ad-
vantage that its topic is political
and always in the news. The
topic of an intellectual sym-
posium, though timely when
chosen, risks diminishing in im-
portance in the public view.

2. Such a program would pro-
bably require a_ substantial
amount of money, and fundrais-
ing could easily be a problem.

3. Student and faculty apathy
could make success impossible.
Forcing people to get together
to do something they are not in-
terested in would not be a
satisfactory or appealing
educational experience.

4. Members of the faculty (or
at least those who are not in-
volved in the event) might find
such a symposium too great a
distraction for students. On the
other hand, heavy student in-
volvement and interest would
be necessary for success.

5. It would probably be
desirable to include represen-
tatives of the neighboring col-
leges in the symposium, but
timing could be a problem since
all of the neighboring colleges
begin their summer vacations
before W&L.

6. The committee aggreed
that if an intellectual sym-
posium were a drain on the
Mock Convention, in terms of
participation, enthusiasm, or
funding, it would be undesir-
able.

Organization, Structure,
Format

The committee concluded
that the only effective way of
organizing an intellectual sym-
posium would bs for it to fall

under the jursidiction of the stu-
dent body Executive Commit-
tee in an arrangement similar
to that of the Mock Convention.
The Executive Committee
would appoint chairmen or a
steering committee to plan and
execute the event with the E.C.
acting in an advisory role.

Faculty participation on the
steering committee from the
first stages would be crucial.
Since the program involves
many academic aspects, sever-
al faculty members would need
to be heavily involved in more
than an advisory capacity.
They would help nurture in-
terest within the faculty and
through their classes. But the
role of the faculty should not
become too great. For example,
if the president or deans were to
appoint a steering committee
from the faculty only, student
interest would likely be very
low.

Extending the event over too
long a period of time would
make it difficult to sustain in-
terest and likely interfere with
the work of the Mock Conven-
tion. Therefore, the committee
recommended that the sym-
posium operate on a four-year
cycle, with the climax to come
on the even numbered years
where there is no Mock Conven-
tion. Planning would begin in
the fall after a Mock Convention
and continue throughout the
year with research beginning
that spring. Research would
continue throughout the next
academic year with a finale
taking place during the spring
term. (Example. Since a Mock
Convention was held last
spring, planning would have
begun this past fall, with the
Executive Committee appoin-
ting the steering committee.
Planning would be done
throughout the 1980-81
academic year with some

research projects taking place
this spring. Research and work
would increase during the
1981-82 academic year, and
would culminate during the 1982
spring term.) Such an arrange-
ment would not interfere with
the Mock Convention very
much, since the work that is
done the year after a convention
is not very great and the major
work does not begin until the
year before the event — which
would be the year after the in-
tellectua| symposium.

Throughout the planning
stages of the event the steering
committee would bring speak-
ers to the campus from the
various disciplines involved in
the issue or topic. Seminar
topics and independent study
projects would be designed in
conjuction with the topic.

Some type of finale weekend
event would be required to
make the program a success.
The committee thought such an
event should be held over a
weekend in the spring term and
include several different ac-
tivities. There would be groups
discussing the findings of their
research and work, public de-
bates, nationally reknown
speakers, and a social event.
There would be some type of
competition between groups or
individuals who have worked on
different aspects of the theme.
The journalism department
may wish to make some type of
film of the proceedings of the
event as a creative project.

One highlight of the final
weekend would be the compila-
tion of a ‘“‘platform’’ or ‘‘white
paper.’’ The document would,
the committee hoped, be of in-
terest to the media and various
institutions. At least part of the
document would include a posi-
tion paper of the student body
and faculty, much like the plat-
form of the Mock Convention.

It is unlikely that the E.C.
could fund such an organization
the way they fund other campus
activities, so the committee felt
that the intellectual symposium
should look to funding sources
similar to those of the Mock
Convention, particulary ap-
peals to corporations and foun-
dations. The symposium would
have a particular topic that
would surely coincide with the
interests of many corporations,
foundations, and individuals. In
addition, university groups or
departments could provide sup-
port. The ‘‘Contact’’ speaker
series, for example, might con-
sider using its resources to
bring speakers to speak on the
topic during the final year.

Possible Topics

When considering possible
topics the committee examined
whether or not a topic would be
worthwhile for every academic
interest at Washington and Lee
and whether or not interest in
the topic could be sustained for
a long period of time. The
following are suggested topics:

1. energy (a possible outline
for this topic has been provided
by the committee)

2. crime

3. athletics and education

4. government and the in-
dividual

5. world hunger

6. intelligent

Dana donates

The Charles A. Dana Founda-
tion has awarded Washington
and Lee University
under the foundation’s Alumni
Annual Giving Challenge Grant
program.

Washington and Lee was one
of five institutions throughout
the country which were award-
ed such challenge grants from
the Dana Foundation for the
1981-82 academic year.

W&L qualified for the $83,500
grant by increasing its annual
giving in four different cate-
gories — total gifts, the size of
the average gift, gifts from new
givers, and the percentage of
alumni participation.

The 1981-82 annual fund at
Washington and Lee exceeded
its $1,250,000 goal in achieving a
total of $1,279,983, establishing a
new high in total giving. The
fund posted a 9.3% increase
over the 1980-81 effort.

“We are quite proud of the
success of our annual fund cam-
paign and deeply appreciate the
Dana Foundation’s challenge
grant, which made an extreme-
ly successful annual fund even
more successful,’’ said
Washington and Lee President
Robert E. R. Huntley.

The Dana Foundation is a
private foundation chartered in
1950. The foundation has long
been concerned with the broad
fields of health and higher

 

$83,500 :

education, thereby reflecting
the interests and concerns of
the founders, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles A. Dana.

Through a program of grants
in higher education, the founda-
tion seeks to assist private in-
stitutions of recognized quality
in strengthening their in-
dependence and their educa-
tional capacity.

This is the second major
grant that Washington and Lee
has received from the Dana
Foundation. The first, in 1969,
was for $250,000 and was desig-
nated for use in the renovation
project that resulted in a new
home for the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics
— the Commerce School
Building — in what was former-
ly the undergraduate library
building.

Because the 1969 gift was
such an important element in
the accomplishment of that pro-
ject, the largest teaching area
in the Commerce School
Building has been named the
Charles A. Dana Lecture Room.

‘Everyone connected with
Washington and Lee University
should be grateful .for the sup-
port the university has received
from the Dana Foundation,”
said William Ford of Atlanta,
the chairman of W&L’s 1981-82
annual fund.

David Ridlon, a W&L senior,
has been elected Corps Com-
mander of the university’s Ar-
my ROTC for 1982-83.

Other W&L seniors who were
named officers in the Army
ROTC corps are Anthony Zac-
cagnini, Corps Executive Of-

ficer; Robert G. Ortiz, Adju-
tant; Newton Kendrick, In-
telligence/Security Officer;
Bowen Woodruff, Sup-
ply/Logistics Officer; and,
Robert A. Stephen, Assistant
Operations Officer.

Meantime, three W&L ROTC

cadets competed for and .won
the opportunity to attend the Ar-
my’s Flight Orientation Pro-
gram at Fort Rucker, Ala., this
past summer.

The three, all seniors, are
Zaccagnini, Don J. Dudley, and
H. Brady Millican III.

 

 

Announcement of Chapman’s
appointment was made by
James W. Whitehead, director
of the Reeves Center, which
opened in September and
serves as the permanent home
for the university’s two impor-
tant collections: the Reeves
Collection of porcelain and the
paintings by Louise Herreshoff.

In his capacity as program
coordinator, Chapman will be
primarily responsible for coor-
dinating student research pro-

i

jects and programs at the
center. He will also be involved
with planning for special
events.

A native of Greenwich, Conn.,
Chapman received the B.A.
degree from Washington and
Lee in 1964 and the J.D. degree
from the University of North
Carolina School of Law in 1967.

The appointment is effective
immediately.

Automatic rule
committee meets

The Committee on _ the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec.
22, 1982 to consider the
academic records of those
students who have fallen under
the Automatic Rule:

1. Students who failed to meet
the conditions of Academic Pro-
bation required of them at the
end of the current Fall term;

2. Students completing a full
academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances,
he may write a letter to the
Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Dean of the College
before the Committee meets.

In general, the Committee
grants few immediate rein-

statements. A student who falls
under the Automatic Rule has
severed his connection with the
university. If the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible
for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the
Automatic Rule will receive a
letter explaining his status.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student not subject to the
Automatic Rule in December
who fails to achieve the
cumulative average required of
him at the end of Fall term, 1982
(see page 61 in Catalogue),
places himself on Academic
Probation for Winter Term,
1983.

Students respond

in droves to STU

About 600 Washington and
Lee University students have
found a better way to reach out
and touch someone this year.
They have joined the universi-
ty’s newly-formed Student
Telephone Union.

Proposed a year ago by the
student government at W&L,
the Student Telephone Union is
a co-operative that has entered
into an agreement with the Cen-
tral Telephone Company of
Virginia (CENTEL), the
telephone company serving
Lexington.

Under terms of the agree-
ment, members of the Student
Telephone Union are no longer
required to pay the _ initial
deposit of $75 to begin their
telephone service each year.

And if a union member does
not pay his monthly phone bill,
the union will cover a portion of
the bill to avoid having service
disconnected.

The cost? Membership in the
Student Telephone Union is $7
for the first year, $4 for the se-
cond year, and free for the final
two years of a student’s tenure
at Washington and Lee.

“Our target audience this
first year was the freshman
class, whose members would
come to Lexington without any
established credit ratings and
who would benefit most by be-
ing able to take advantage of
the union during their entire
four years at W&L,”’ said W&L
junior Lee Feldman, who is
chairman of the co-operative
that is being operated entirely

by students.

The union began by mailing
letters to the entering freshmen
explaining the new venture.
During the first two weeks of
classes, Feldman and his fellow
officers in STU manned a booth
at the CENTEL office to accept
memberships.

“We had expected that we
could have a membership of
about 150 students this first
year,”’ Feldman said. ‘‘That
was the number we felt we
would need in order to cover our
estimated liability.”

But by late October, the Stu-

dent Telephone Union had
slightly more than 560
members.

The plan, which is modeled
after a similar co-operative at
the University of Virginia, has
proved popular not only with
W&L students. Officials of
CENTEL are happy with the ar-
rangements as well.

‘“‘We have been very pleased
with the cooperation of the Stu-
dent Telephone Union,” said
Joyce Humphries, business of-
fice manager for CENTEL in
Lexington. ‘‘Lee Feldman has
been very helpful in establish-
ing the agreement between
CENTEL and STU. The
primary purpose of the agree-
ment is to permit the student
member to have telephone ser-
vice without having to pay a
deposit.

“This saves time for the
business office and for the stu-
dent when he applies for ser-
vice. It also provides a certain

amount of security for the
telephone company with the
cooperative effort of the Stu-
dent Telephone Union to effect
prompt payment of telephone
bills.

‘‘We appreciate our telephone
customers, and prompt pay-
ments certainly make our job
easier. It also protects the
credit reputation of the
customer. We are very op-
timistic about the results of
STU.”

Feldman is equally optimistic
— so optimistic that he is ex-

ploring the possiblity of incor-
porating the union.

‘“‘We have also discussed in-
formally the possibilities of ex-
panding the union to cover other
utilities with which students are
involved in Lexington — from
electricity to cable television
service,” said Feldman. ‘‘In the
long run, a successful union
helps everyone, the students
and the Lexington businesses.
That is our aim. And so far I’ve
been extremely pleased with
the cooperation we’ve gotten on
all sides in this new venture.”

Local ski resorts add lifts, extra slopes

By ALLEN ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer
Despite recent high

temperatures in Virginia, the
1982 skiing season has begun.
Meteorologists are predicting
an especially cold winter in the
mid-Atlantic states, and new
lifts and trails at nearby resorts
promise a good ski season for
Washington and Lee students.
Day-trippers will find three
new expert slopes serviced by a
triple-chair lift at Wintergreen,
offering a 1,003-foot vertical
drop. As part of a $2 million ex-
pansion program, the new “High-
lands area’ will be serviced by
a revamped snowmaking
system. A new water-cooling
device will allow more snow to
be made faster and earlier in
the season. Because the new ex-
pert slopes are removed from
the beginner and intermediate
trails, the Highlands area
boasts a special attraction to
the more advanced skier.
Wintergreen’s 10 slopes now

include three beginner runs,
two intermediate trails and five
expert plunges. One of the new
trails, ‘‘Cliffhanger,”’ is a nar-
row fall-line dive between the
trees. The longest of the new
slopes is ‘“‘Wild Turkey,”’ which
runs 4,450 feet under the new
triple-chair lift.

The addition of the Highlands
area makes Wintergreen the
largest night skiing spot in the
mid-Atlantic region. Lift tickets
and equipment rentals are of-
fered daily at a discount for
students with valid college I.D.
Except for the last five days of
December and Valentine’s Day,
midweek rates offer significant
savings. For students, a full day
lift ticket during the week costs
$12. Midweek half-day passes
for four hours of skiing sell for
$8, and night skiing tickets cost
students $9.

The unequipped mink can
rent skis, boots and poles for $9
midweek, and half-day and
half-night rentals cost $7. The

ski school uses the American
Teaching Method, and group
lessons of an hour and a half
will cost you $10. If your wallet
is thick, private lessons can be
had for $25. Weekend rates are
much higher than the weekday
fees, and the slopes are in-
variably crowded.

Wintergreen’s slopes are
open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
every day, and on night-skiing
days from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Wintergreen is located just off
the Reed’s Gap exit of the Blue
Ridge Parkway near Char-
lottesville. It takes just a little
longer to get to the slopes than
to reach Mary Baldwin, so prox-
imity is the main attraction of
Wintergreen.

If you are unsure of ski condi-
tions at Wintergreen, you can
call the resort at (804) 325-2100,
24 hours a day.

Bryce Mountain in the
Shenandoah Valley is a family-
oriented ski area, but Massa-
nutten, off Interstate 81 near

Staunton, offers a nearby alter-
native to Wintergreen.

For the dedicated snowhound
willing to travel four hours by
car, Snowshoe in West Virginia
most nearly approximates the
challenge of New England’s
big-time restorts. The region’s
largest resort, Snowshoe has
just cut two new intermediate
trails and an expert run. The
new slopes will be serviced by
two newly-unveiled triple-chair
lifts, and feature 6000 feet of
uninterrupted cruising on
“Hawthorne.”

Despite these improvements
and the opening of three new
restaurants and a lounge, the
ski area has not raised its
package prices. The area’s ren-
tal and lesson fees are com-
parable to those at Winter-
green, while lift tickets are
justifiably more expensive.

Snowshoe offers 25 percent
discounts during ‘Wild, Won-
derful Season” until Dec. 17. If
you are fortunate enough to

The first test of the Student
Telephone Union came when
CENTEL’s bills went out
recently. The result, said
Feldman, was positive.

‘‘We had only two minor pro-
blems in payment,” he said.
“And both of those were resolv-
ed without any real difficulty.
I’m more confident than ever
that the union will be an ex-
tremely effective and suc-
cessful venture.”’

direction of Jeff Hanna.

finish final exams before Wed-
nesday, you can buy one night’s
lodging and a two-day lift pass
for $30.75. This special deal for

students can be reserved by
calling (304) 799-6762. Since

1977, Snowshoe has hosted the
season’s first skiers no later
than Nov. 27, and last winter the
resort caught 7% feet of
snowfall before Dec. 31.

Snowshoe is noted not only for
its mile-long ‘Cupp Run” but
also for its night life. Shavers
Center offers live entertain-
ment seven nights a week, and
pubs and bars like the Rocky
Racoon Saloon provide lively
apres-ski activity. For the stu-
dent hedonist there are hot tubs,
saunas and a swimming pool.

Information on these and
other ski areas can be obtained
from Herring Travel on Main
Street and Travel Unlimited
next to Liloyd’s. The W&L
Outing Club also sponsors group
trips to Wintergreen during the
Winter.

God is dead, a late philosopher has said,
There are no values save those we create.
And yet who listens to the mad or dead?

We know the man that all ought emulate—
No classroom titan he, he’s not pre-med,
But socially he carries his own weight.

Go to the Pit next Tuesday for a drink.
You’ll surely see our hero — he’s The Mink.

His dress and manners show that he’s well-bred;
He’s quite well-versed in use of starch and wine.
Although in poetry he’s not well read,

He knows the value of a timely line.

His words do not reveal what’s in his head—
They’re masked in innocence—that’s by design.
His car’s a bit obnoxious, that is true—

He drives a tricked out BMW.

So raise a mug—The Mink! Long may he rule!

I sing his song because he’s not a bad

Guy, really, least of all the stupid fool

Some make him out to be. He’s just a lad

Who wants to have some fun and get through school,
And reap the benefits of majoring in pre-dad.

And when he uses his capacities

He’s much maligned for immoralities.

Before you call him stupid wait until

You’ve seeen him work a crowd of women late

At night—he’s a brilliant judge of men and still

A better judge of women. He can weight

In moments with a glance the female will,

And lust, and other facts, and separate

Awarm and sultry smile that’s sure to please
From the condescending grin of a Southern tease.

And our discerning hero sees through lots

More grand pretensions. Just last month he saw
Through selfish machinations, greedy plots

By curs whose victories have rubbed him raw—
The Moping, whining dolts that play like have-nots:
Of course I mean those in our school of law

Who view Woods Creek as if it were a wall

That separates the Hill from Lewis Hall.

The Mink

The Mink can’t understand why they’re so mad
Since they receive the benefits of all

Our other groups, and hence his taxes add

To their increase while they in turn recall

The greatest sum that can by guile be had

For their exclusive use. He sees the wall

For what it is — a mind forged, cheap excuse
To justify an SBA turned loose

VI

Vil

To plunder from the student treasury.
They do this on the weak pretense that none
Of us can understand minority,

As if tosay that we are all but one,

The Delt and SPE and Intervarsity.
Their plea for independence must be done
Through ignorance of different campus styles

Or else — oh can it be? To law school wiles.

VII

Their arrogance then rankles him again,

Their smug, anonymous attacks that never cease.
So humble leadership is what they’re fair in?

In fiscal matters kind at least?

They take their cue from the late Tom Gearen

On how to steal a two fold tax increase.

So the heads of SAB mismanagement too?

Perhaps their yearbook editor will do.

They whine that Fancy Dress is on their break,

Woodwinds show
varied repetoire

By ROGER DAY
Special to The Phi

The critically acclaimed
Boehm Woodwind Quintette
performed last Thursday eve-
ning as the second of four Con-
cert Guild concerts. They
brought to Lee Chapel a perfor-
mance marked by fine musi-
cianship, excellent ensemble,
and a varied repertoire.

From this repertoire, the
quintette performed Quintetto
No. 3 in B flat, by Giovanni
Giuseppe Cambini, Characteris-
tic Suite by Manuel de Falla,
Quintet, Op. 9 by Josef B.
Foerster, and Wind Quintet by
Charles Wuorinen.

The Quintette opened with a
selection by the relatively
unknown Italian composer
Cambini, one of the originators
of music for woodwind quintette
music. This piece reflected the
group’s close knit sound and
harmony as well as demon-
strated the respective in-
dividual talents in the group.

By contrast the Wind Quintet
by modern composer Charles
Wuorinen showed the ability of
the Quintette to play in the dis-
jointed style characteristic of
contemporary music. Though it
was difficult to listen to the
Wuorinen piece, the musicality
of its performance was still on
par with the other selections.

The Quintette’s flowing rendi-
tion of Characteristic Suite by
Manuel de Falla, the 20th cen-
tury Spanish composer proved
to be the most pleasant selec-
tion of the evening and the au-
dience response reflected this.

The Boehm Quintette proved
in the end to be very worthy of
their critical acclaim. It was a
rare joy to listen to and enjoy
such an assembly of fine
musical talent, very dedicated
to their profession. The Concert
Guild Board and Professor
Stewart should count them-
selves lucky to have had them
on their 1982-83 calender.

And so for them entails unfair expense—
At least it makes a great excuse to rake
In bucks! The overweenies want some recompense—
We needn’t ask whose money they would take.
Here’s what we’d do if we had any sense;
Take half of all the taxes that they pay

And buy’em tickets to Detroit — one way!

X

The Mink likes better to have unity

In fact — parties, yearbooks, papers, not

The mutual benign neglect that we

With yellow, spineless bribery have bought.
They must be forced to join this university

As one, and if they don’t perhaps the cure ought
Be to make the law school unisex

And so remove that problem from Big Lex.

Tonight

The University Federation of
Washington and Lee University
is sponsoring a Christmas
Candlelight Service for the Lex-
ington community on Thursday

Rush concert works

tough crowd

By BRIAN J. OLIGER
Special to The Phi

The Canadian rock group
Rush illustrated just why they
have been labeled ‘‘the thinking
man’s heavy metal band’’ at the
Hampton Coliseum on Tuesday,
Nov. 31. Greeted by a surpris-
ingly unruly crowd, Rush pro-
ceeded to calm the group by
performing their latest album,
Italics, almost in its entirety
combined with a variety of
earlier tunes from 2112,
Hemispheres, Permanent Waves,
and Moving Pictures.

Fronted by keyboard player
and bassist Geddy Lee on lead
vocals, Rush roared through
some of its most popular com-
positions penned by Lee and
guitarist Alex Lifeson. Most of
the band’s powerful lyrics are
written by percussionist Neil
Peart, a former professor of
philosophy at the University of
Toronto, in the band’s home-
town.

The concert opened With the
ever-popular ‘“‘Spirit of Radio,”
leading into “Tom Sawyer.”
The performance also featured
the tunes “Red Barchetta,”
“The Trees,” ‘Vital Signs,”
“Limelight,” and a rousing ren-
dition of ‘‘Closer to the Heart.”
Thundering applause and
cheers indicated the crowd’s
approval for each song; in-
cluding a finely crafted medley
of “Xanadu” and “La Villa
Strangiato.’’ Called for an en-
core, the band struck up the in-
strumental ‘“YYZ,’’ inspired by
the code name and signal notes
of the Torono International Air-
port, much to the joy of the
ecstatic crowd.

The opening band was a
disappointment, lacking depth,
conviction, and acceptable
material to perform. The crowd
was not pleased. Eager for
Rush, they pressed against the
barricade in front of the stage

October.

hard enough that the stage
buckled. After repeated pleas
from the stage crew and a
threat of no performance, the
mob backed off. Following the
third tune of the show (‘‘Free
Will’), Geddy Lee asked the
crowd to stop throwing the
glow-in-the-dark objects that
filled the air between bands.
This request was honored until
the encore, when one sailed onto
the stage and hit Lee in the arm
as he played. This ellicited a
scowl from Lee, who was other-
wise unaffected by the incident.

Extensive use of film and
lighting created a dramatic ef-
fect. The most appealing use of
film in the show occurred dur-
ing the song ‘Countdown,’
written about the Space Shuttle
Columbia. Breathtaking shots
of the preparation and liftoff of
Columbia were projected on a
large screen behind the band as
it performed the song amidst a
cloud of fog rising from beneath
the stage. Peart says of the
song, ‘‘I only hope (it) comes
even close to capturing the ex-
citement and awe that we felt
(upon witnessing the initial lift-
off from Cape Kennedy).” It
did, as the crowd roared with
delight when Columbia lifted off
to the music of the band.

Peart, considered to be
among rock’s finest drummers,
played his traditional candy-
apple red mammoth set of
Tama drums during the show.
Lee played primarily a Ricken-
backer bass and synthesizers
by Moog and Oberheim. Lifeson
worked with Fender Stratocas-
ters of various color and vin-
tage, a Gibson Les Paul and an
Ovation Classical guitar.

Throughout the show, the
group combined musicianship
seldom found in heavy metal
bands, a superior light show
and a good ability to work the
audience.

Cagers sport 3-2 record

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

After losing to Hampden-
Sydney on the road last Tues-
day, the Washington and Lee
basketball team rebounded to
win two non-league games at
home in the last week while
raising their record to 3-2.

W&L Coach Verne Canfield
had mixed feelings about his
team’s performance to date.
“I’m disappointed — but not
discouraged — because I know
they’ll keep working and be all
right,’’ Canfield stated.

At Hampden Sydney the
Generals almost pulled off a
tremendous comeback, but
came up just short. The Tigers
won 69-67. The Generals trailed
59-36 with about ten minutes to
play, but W&L closed within
three points with a minute to
play. The Tigers were able to
thwart the Generals rally, and
hand the Generals their first
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference loss of the season.

Junior guard Billy Yates, who
hit a three-point halfcourt bomb
at the buzzer, led W&L with 25
points, 23 of which came in the
second half. Senior forward
Brian Hanson tossed in 16 points
for the Generals.

Although the new three-point
play rule in the ODAC aided the
Generals comeback in the Syd-
ney game, Coach Canfield does
not particularly like the rule.

“I think the three-point play
stinks. I was the only coach who
voted against it. A three-point
play in Division III at 21 feet is

ridiculous. I think it takes away
from team play,’’ Canfield con-
cluded.

Last Thursday in the Warner
Center the Generals burst out to
an early 17-4 lead and never
looked back as they defeated
Shenandoah College 56-48.
Shenandoah never closed within
more than seven points after
the Generals early streak.

Brian Hanson lead the way
for the Generals with 16 points
and 11 rebounds. Sophomore
guard Lex Fitzenhagen tossed
in 11 points.

Tuesday night, the Generals
came from behind to defeat
Averett College in the Warner
Center 55-50.

It was a seesaw battle all the
way as the Cougars jumped out
to an early 6-2 lead. W&L fought
back to as much as 16-8 after
Lex Fitzenhagen hit a layup to
complete a superb fastbreak.

The lead would change hands
twice again before the half
though. Averett converted two
successive steals into fastbreak
baskets to take a 29-26 lead with
2:09 left in the half. But the
Generals bounced right back,
with senior Jay Fechtel hitting
a baseline jumper at the buzzer
to give W&L a 30-29 half time
lead.

Averett took control of the
game early in the second half,
as the Generals appeared a lit-
tle sluggish. With seven min-
utes remaining, the Cougars led
at 47-42. |

whittle away the Averett lead.
Senior Frank Eppes grabbed an
offensive rebound and scored to
make it 47-44. With 5:16 remain-
ing Brian Hanson hit a driving
layup to narrow the Averett
lead to one point.

With a little more than three
minutes left the Generals final-
ly caught Averett, when Billy
Yates hit a driving layup to tie
the score at 48-48. Brian Hanson
stole the ensuing inbounds pass
and hit a short jumper to put the
Generals ahead for good at
50-48.

W&L held off Averett the rest
of the way in spite of the fact
that the Generals missed
several foul shots. Sophomore
David Wilkinson finally sealed
the victory when he hit both
ends of a one-and-one with 19
seconds left.

No General hit double figures
in the game, but Frank Eppes,
Brian Hanson and Billy Yates
all netted nine points. Lex
Fitzenhagen came off the bench
to contribute eight points.

Coach Canfield indicated that
he will continue to substitute
frequently as he did in the
Averett game. “We want to
keep fresh guards in the game.
When ‘I’m not satisfied with
the guards in the game, I will
substitue for them” he stated.

Canfield was fairly pleased
with the performance of his
front line against Averett, but
he noted that they failed to box
out on twelve occasions. “It’s
just a matter of better concen-
tration on their part,” Canfield
stated.

One thing Canfield is par-
ticularly pleased with is his
team’s academic performance.

“Half our team’s on the
Dean’s List. Our team’s
academic average is higher
than the school’s academic
average,’ Canfield reported.

After Wednesday night’s
ODAC game at home against
Catholic, W&L will not play
again until after Christmas
break. The week after break,

Freshmen pitch in at Invitational

By SCOTT SLADE
Phi Staff Writer

Three Washington and Lee
wrestlers took places out of the
ten standard weight classes in
last weekend’s ninth annual
W&L Invitational.

Brian Lifstead and Larry
Anker both placed fourth at 126
and 134 pounds respectively.
Jeff Dixon was defeated in the
second round of the double
elimination play by the winner
of 190 pound class but won con-
solation matches to take the
number three spot in the
heaviest class.

Washington and Lee was
seventh out of the eight teams
which included Georgia Tech,
Campbell, Hiram, Gettysburg,
York, crosstown rival VMI and
a ‘“B’’ squad composed of
wrestlers from both W&L and
VMI.

VMI defended their title with

a team score of 11214 which out-
distanced the second place
team Gettysburg by 62%, points.
VMI had six first place
finishers.

The remaining teams were
ranked as follows: Hiram, third
with 4714, Campbell fourth with
40%4, Georgia Tech fifth with 34,
York sixth with 32%, W&L
seventh with 16%4, and the ‘“‘B”’
squad with 15%.

The Washington and Lee
wrestlers entered this tourna-
ment with a 1-0 record after
grappling to a close 22-21 vic-
tory over the Tigers of Hamp-
den-Sydney in Farmville last
Wednesday night.

The Generals next match will
be against the wrestling team of
Lynchburg College Dec. 8 in
Doremus Gym. Lynchburg’s
record stands at 0-1 after a
decisive 43-7 loss to Longwood
College last week.

W&L hosts state swim meet, places fifth

By MIKE STACHURA
Assitant Sports Editor
The W&L swim team turned
in what Coach Page Remillard
termed a ‘‘pleasant surprise’’ in
last week’s Virginia State
Men’s Swimming and Diving
Championships hosted by the
Generals.

Despite their fifth place finish —

behind James Madison (first),
Virginia Commonwealth (se-
cond), Richmond (third), and
VMI (fourth), Coach Remillard
said he was “pleased with the
performance.”’

‘“‘We’re swimming well with
consistency,’”’ remarked the
Generals’ mentor. Remillard
went into the meet realizing
that his swimmers’ first priori-
ty was going to be studying,
rather than swimming, but still
he noted, ‘‘We have some very
good times for this early in the
season,”

Leading the Generals’ times
over the weekend were junior
Tim Rock and freshman Tim
Stanford. Both Rook and Stan-

ford were just shy of the NCAA
Division III Championships
qualifying standards. Rock took
a third in the 1650-yard free-

style with with 16:52.92, just a.

half a second off the qualifying
mark, while Stanford placed
third in the 100-yard butterfly,
broke his own school record set
on Nov. 18, and was also just .17
of a second off that qualifying
time.

Rock also captured another
third-place finish, this time in
the 500 free, to round out his
performance. Stanford, mean-
while, finished his work by tak-:
ing fifth place in the 200 fly.

Other leaders at the Cham-
pionships for W&L included
junior Gary Meyer in the 100
and 50 free, sophomore Bob
Pearson in the 100 free and 200
fly, and freshman John Moody
in the 500 free and 100 fly.

There was another story over
the weekend that dealt W&L
swimming a major setback. In
what Remillard called a “‘tragic
loss’’ the Generals’ junior cap-

tain and freestyle sprint leader
Rand McClain left the team to
concentrate on his academics.
“I respect Rand’s decision.
He’s a talented athlete and his
contributions will be missed,’
commented a noticeably dis-
traught head coach.

“But,” he was quick to add,
“I see the team meeting the
challenge already. We have our
best young nucleus in a long
time.’’ Remillard noted that he
sees continued improvement
down the road. He also expects
to have four or five swimmers
qualify for nationals.
