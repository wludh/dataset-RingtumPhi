press ethics

Dancy decries
‘star complex’

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

NBC News correspondent
John Dancy told a university
audience Friday night that ‘‘as
a result of the election Tuesday,
we may see a crippled Presi-
dent for two years.”

He went on to deplore some of
the practices of his own profes-
sion, saying he is ‘‘appalled’’ by
the attention that’s given to
ratings of news programs and
that broadcasting’s so-called
‘‘star complex’ is “‘one of the
greatest evils we face in jour-
nalism.”’

Dancy made the comments at
a session of W&L’s ninth annual
Institute on the Ethics of Jour-
nalism, one facet of the Society
and the Professions program,
which reviews ethical questions
involved with the practice of
journalism, law, medicine, and
this year for the first time,
business. (See related story,
page 4.) *

Dancy, who’s been an NBC
correspondent since 1965, cur-
rently covers the Senate for the
network. On Election Night, he
conducted live interviews from
Capitol Hill.

He says he much prefers the
Congressional beat to his
previous post at the White
House. ‘“The place leaks like a
sieve,’’ he told the audience.
“The average life of a secret on
Capitol Hill is about 3.7
minutes.”’

Senate coverage is ‘very
satisfying,” while working the
other end of Pennsylvania
Avenue can be ‘‘frustrating and
dissatisfying.”’ At the White
House, ‘‘much of the informa-
tion is spoon-fed, and there’s
very little time for enterprise;
.. sometimes I think (covering
the White House) requires no
experience whatsoever.”’

Dancy told the crowd, ‘‘The
power of the press is awesome,
and I oppose any attempts to
limit us.”’ For example, he said,
‘I oppose the attempts to limit
the Freedom of Information
Act. It’s been a good act and it’s
been helpful to us.’”’

“The press corps, particular-
ly the Washington press corps,
wield tremendous power. It’s
the power to set the agenda,
decide what people are going to

Munger
to retire

Students lose
a friend and
an institution

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

July 1, 1967, was a red letter
day in W&L history. On that
day, Betty Munger entered the
scene in full force as_ the
bookstore manager. August 31,
1983, will also be a landmark
day. Betty Munger will be retir-
ing.

“Oh I don’t know what I’ll be
doing in my retirement exactly.
I’m afraid I'll be lonely,’ she
said recently.

“T think I may work as a
volunteer in the public library.
Did you know there is a public
library in Lexington? It used to
be above McCrum’s drugstore,
but now it has its own building.

‘‘T hope to audit a few courses
here.

‘‘Maybe I’ll travel, but I only
want to see New Zealand yet. Of
course I’]] read.

“And cook; I love cooking.

‘Who knows what else may be

thrown in there.”’

As her mind jumps quickly
from subject to subject, it
seems unlikely that Betty
Munger will suffer from
boredom. Loneliness? Unlikely.

“T’ll miss the guys the most, I
think. Over the years, I’ve en-
joyed them very much. They
keep me young, on my toes. I’m
devoted to them. It’s funny how
shy and quiet and meek they
are when they come as fresh-
men,”’ she said.

“Then they change, and |
hear all about the summer jobs
and love affairs. That I’ll miss
terribly.”

Few students will forget. Dur-
ing freshmen orientation, her
“beer, bed and breakfast’
speech has become a command
performance.

“That speech can’t be more
than three or four years old,”
Munger noted. “Students love
it, but few appreciate what I am
really saying in it. Girls are
concerned about more than bed,
beer, and breakfast. They’re
not just necessities for a party
as some guys think around
here. That mentality is exactly
why I think W&L should go
coed.”’

And off she started at a gallop
on women and W&L.

“Why should the university
go coed?’’ she queried
rhetorically. “‘Look at the cen-

Trustees step in as
Reagan steps out

By NORMA ANNE CHATTIN
Phi Staff Writer

Even though the academic
session began without the full
knowledge of how much money
Washington and Lee would
receive from the federal
government in financial aid,
Michael Bartini was not exactly
sitting on the edge of his chair
waiting for the figures.

Bartini was more confident
than some other directors of
‘financial aid across the nation
because his office has a
guarantee from the university’s
board of trustees to make up the
difference in the federal finan-
cial aid cuts with university
money. Bartini was able to
meet the needs of all returning
students on financial aid and a
large majority of freshmen
qualifying for need based aid.

Some 25 percent of students
receive what is known as need
based aid granted on the basis
of a_student’s income, his
parent’s income and assets
computed by the federal
government.

Students

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

Expectations of higher
operating costs led to the 7.4
percent increase in tuition by
the Washington and Lee Board
of Trustees last month, Univer-
sity Treasurer Stewart Epley
said Tuesday.

Operating costs of the univer-
sity will also rise by 7.4 percent
in the next year and tuition
revenues are expected to cover
63 percent of those costs, Epley
said.

That means the proportion of
the total cost of running

Bartini didn’t know how much
would be cut, but he didn’t want
students to have to wait to know
how much they would get.
‘“‘We’re concerned, but we can’t
hold up the ship,”’ said Bartini.
The financial aid office was not
left completely in the dark since
he was provided with estimates
of the proposed cuts.

“We feel very fortunate to
have the trustees behind us,”
said Bartini, “but there may
come a time when they are not
always able to make up the dif-
ference between the federal
funding and the students’
needs.”’

Maintaining the financial aid
program is important to Bartini
and the rest of the college com-
munity. ‘The aid provides an
important diversity to campus
and gives us access to students
who otherwise might not be able .
to attend.” Notes Bartini,
“some institutions do not have
the resources we do, which
makes it even more important
for us to maintain our pro-
gram.”

Washington and Lee University
borne by the student body will
increase only slightly. But
students are already paying for
a high proportion of the cost of
their education.

Students at the University of
Virginia are paying for about 30
percent of their school’s opera-
tional costs while W&L students
are paying 62 percent this year.

UVa is funded by the State of
Virginia unlike private schools
like W&L where endowment
and gifts pay for the balance of
operating costs that are not
covered by student fees.

Washington and Lee Univer-

ing to statistics compiled by

pressures of increasing tuition
and a sudden slashing of federal
funds for student loans are forc-
ing him to dig deeper into the
pocket.

In response to this, the
university is attempting to in-
crease the financial aid re-
sources available to students.
The Board of Trustees authoriz-
ed an increase of 25 percent in
financial aid at the same time
they increase tuition.

Next year the university will
give to students one dollar in
financial awards of every ten
dollars spent on operations.

from state, federal, or other
sources.

The $1.5 million has been
awarded through 14 different
financial aid programs, rang-
ing from need-based university
grants to an expanding pro-
gram of honor scholarships and
included $267,250 in loans the
university has made to law
students.

Not included in the $1.5
million financial aid total is
slightly more than $100,000 of
aid that was awarded this year
to students from Rockbridge
County in the form of tuition
waivers.

Financial aid funds at Wash-
ington and Lee come from gifts
or endowments _ specifically
designated for student aid, in-
cluding $600,000 this year from
the Pratt Fund, a $12 million be-
quest to the university from the
estate of John Lee Pratt of
Fredericksburg, Va. In his 1976
bequest, Pratt specified that the
fund should be used to permit
W&L to “offer more scholar-
ships for outstanding students”’
and to increase faculty salaries.

“With the much-publicized
decrease in federal funds for
student aid, we found it
necessary to make significant
increases in our need-based
aid,” said Bartini, noting that
university grants that are based
on a student’s need have in-
creased from a total of $460,000
for the 1981-82 academic year to
$740,000 this year.

Another area that has in-
creased dramatically involves
the university’s program of
honor scholarships — grants
ranging up to the full amount of
tuition offered to students with
records of exceptional achieve-
ment and unusual promise.

In 1981-82 the total amount
awarded in honor scholarships
was $96,000. This year that total
was $127,000.

Washington and Lee has add-
ed three honor scholarships in
the past two years: the Dora L.
Lewis Scholarship, the Best
Products Foundation Scholar-
ship and the Baltimore Scholar-
ship.

The increase in financial aid
awards at Washington and Lee
is reflected in the last two
freshman classes admitted to
the university.

For instance, 121 of the 365
freshmen who matriculated in
September were awarded aid in
the total amount of $475,000. In-
cluded in that total are 32
students who received no-need,
honor scholarships of between
$400 and $5,400 each.

That compares with two
years ago, when 84 members of
the freshmen class which
enrolled in the fall of 1980
received aid in the total amount
of $296,100. Only 12 students
received no-need, honor
scholarships of between $500
and $1,000 each that year.

One of the new approaches
Washington and Lee is utilizing
in its financial aid program is
represented by the Baltimore
Scholarship, which was award-
ed for the first time this year.
The scholarship is the first of
what the university hopes will
be a series of regional scholar-
ship programs established in
those cities and geographic
regions from which the univer-
sity has traditionally drawn
students and in which there is a
substantial number of alumni to
create and support the scholar-
ships.

The university’s financial aid
program received strong sup-
port from its board of trustees,
which recently approved plans
to increase the amount of finan-
cial aid W&L can award for the
1983-4 academic year by ap-
proximately 25 percent.

In his recent report to parents
of Washington and Lee students
during Parents’ Weekend
festivities on the campus, W&L
President Robert E. R. Huntley
referred to the financial aid pro-
gram at the university when he
said that ‘‘our largest needs for
the future lie in the area of en-
dowment for financial aid pro-
grams. Over the years ahead
we will need to increase signifi-
cantly the amount of money the
university devotes to assisting
students here who cannot afford
to pay their own way.”

New center unifies minority students

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Features Editor
In order to bring the black
students on campus together,
Washington and Lee has con-
verted Lee House, a former up-

perclass dormitory into the new |

Minority Cultural Center.

Five students live in’ the
center that also houses the of-
fices of the Student Association
for Black Unity (SABU) and the
Black American Law Students
Association.

Ron Magee, a junior and the

house’s manager, said the func-
tion of the center is ‘to nave

somewhat of a place where
minority students can come
together and find out about
themselves in a non-formal at-
mosphere. We can laugh and
talk and tell jokes.

“Before, with SABU, we
could not get everybody
together at a particular time.

Also, this removes’ the
restraints,’’ he said.
John White, director of

minority affairs at the universi-
ty, said, ‘One element that
tends to set our center apart
from other similar facilities at
other campuses is the residen-
tial aspect. I think this will help
to create the kind of community
atmosphere that we hope to
generate with the center.”
Magee explained that paren-
tal support was essential in ac-

“Students can retreat here once in a while, but they
must still undergo the mainstream at W&L.”’

quiring the house. Parents of
many of the black students
formed a committee to speak
with President Robert Huntley,
and that “‘set the wheels in mo-
tion,”’ Magee said.

After obtaining the house,
parents also helped by making
curtains, choosing furniture,
and other essentials. White em-
phasized that they weren’t the
only ones responsible, though.

“The university did a simply
superb job in providing this
facility,’ Magee said. He
specifically complimented the
faculty, administration and the
Executive Committee.

The minority center plans to
provide a full social life, but
shuns all comparisons to a
fraternity.

“We look at the fraternity
system as a successful one,”
said Magee, ‘‘but we’re not per-
forming the function of a frater-
nity house. Brotherhood and
camaraderie will be found here
too...but, our main purpose is
performing functions for
minority students.”

Besides parties, the Center
has planned speakers, art
shows and concerts, and con-
ferences with students from
other schools. A reception with
the faculty and hosting a
sociology class have been
among the activities sponsored
thus far this year.

One fear has been that the
center may tend to separate the
students from the rest of W&L
life, but Magee does not forsee a
problem.

“T don’t think this university
will ever get a_ significant
number of black students that
we could become separatists.
We have to integrate...Students
can retreat here once in a while,
but they must still undergo the
mainstream at W&L,”’ he said.

“The center is a place to
allow black students to find
themselves, mature, and adjust
to life at W&L,’’ he said.

Hollins defends

beer policy

To The Editor:

I am writing to you concern-
ing a matter which I believe
needs to be brought to the atten-
tion of all Washington and Lee
students who attend Hollins’
parties. It concerns the beer
procedures at our parties.

There are many reasons why
we serve beer the way we do,
and I feel if our guests unders-
tand these reasons, it may
alleviate many complaints and
misunderstanding.

So often after a Hollins’ party,
numerous W&L students have
been heard to say “‘Why do we
have to pay for beer at Hollins,
when Hollins students attend
W&L fraternity parties and get
free beer?” Fraternities are

part of the members’ dues are
put forth for the sake of parties.
Hollins has no social organiza-
tions or Sororities to fund par-
ties. Therefore financing a
Hollins party entails admission
and beer charges.

When Hollins’ students attend
SAB sponsored events, such as
the Cockpit, we pay for beer and
admission. When parties are
held at the Pavilion or Evans
Dining Hall, we pay one price
which includes both admission
and beer. So now you may ask,
why can’t Hollins do this? But
why should people who don’t
drink pay for people who do
drink? A recent student student
survey at Hollins has concluded
that 12 percent of the class of ’85
and 15 percent of the class of '86
disapprove of the use of alcohol.
Free beer also encourages
waste and excess. When you
have to pay for beer, maybe
you'll think twice about putting
it down, doing something, and
then leaving it there. It may
also make you aware of the
amount you are drinking.

Hollins is neither condemning
drinking nor trying to keep peo-
ple who attend Hollins’ parties
from drinking? What then are
the reasons for a party? They
are here so that Hollins’
students and their guests can
mix, meet, and be with friends.
Parties should be where a group
of people can get together,
listen to music, and have a good

time. Should drinking be the
focus of the evening?

I think it is important that
people who attend Hollins’ par-
ties understand our policies. I
also hope that those who attend
our parties in the future will be
patient with our beer pro-
cedures and have a great time!

Sincerely,

Focus wants
your ideas

Editor:

Focus, the interdisciplinary
symposium, is pleased to an-
nounce a deadline for submis-
sions to its journal The Ex-
celsior. All essays are due on
Nov. 19. We are asking for
essays on any topic and invite
the W&L community to an ex-
change of ideas. So often, the
theories of individuals, ex-
pounded over a glass of beer or
at a cocktail party, are left to
evaporate in thin air. Excelsior
exists to give substance to those
theories, to share those theories
and, hopefully, to spark the kind
of controversy and debate that
is the hallmark of a free society.
Focus and Excelsior have great

promise. We want to share this
journal, eventually, with other
universities. We want to put on
a symposium that shows the
whole region that W&L is a
school of active and thinking
students. Help this organization
live up to its promise. Spend 15
or 20 minutes jotting an idea
down and share it. Submissions
to The Excelsior will be ac-
cepted in Carole Cappell’s of-
fice through Nov. 19 or, call
Chris Bouquet at 463-9524. We
need a chairman for next year

talk about. It’s not a power we
sought — it just grew as televi-
sion grew.” -

Dancy said ‘‘there’s a great
deal of curiosity about the
White House press corps. I
think if we came from the
moon, there wouldn’t be more
interest in us.”

In describing the White House
gress, he said it was very objec-
ive about the issues they
-overed. He cited as examples
‘he fact that he had been unable
10 make up his mind on a posi-
tion on the Panama Canal, the
MX missile or the Social Securi-
ty dilemma Congress faces.

On the whole, he said, ‘‘we’re
male, white, and apolitical.”

Dancy says one White House
reporter in five is in his twen-
ies. “The heavyhitters are in
their forties,”’ he said. Dancy is
46. He continued that four out of
five of the reporters are male,
while four percent is black.

 
  

YOU CAN WAIT YEARS FOR
A JOB WITH RESPONSIBILITY,

In response to a question,
Dancy said he thinks we’re on
our way to a lot of one-term
Presidents. “Given the pro-
blems of the country and the im-
mediacy of the coverage, the
President uses up his mandate
by the first election comes
around....If Ronald Reagan
runs again and wins, he would
be a crippled President going
into that and the country would
suffer for that.’’

The correspondent said the
President is “‘literally a man
who can make peace or start a
war. He can launch the Great

Society or launch a rocket.”

He said the President ‘‘is the
most public man in _ the
world....There’s an enormous
amount of vicarious interest in
what the President of the
United States does....We
Americans would like to have a
king.”’ However, he also reaps
the benefits of the exposure.

 

 

 

 

Dancy called the President’s

“ability to command televi-

sion” a “formidable advan-
tage.”

Dancy said how  well-
informed the press corps is
about the inner workings of the
Executive Mansion is largely
dependent on the _ press
secretary. ‘Jody Powell was
one of three of four decision-
makers in the Carter Ad-
ministration. When he told you
something, you knew he’d been
in on it.’” Reagan’s spokesman,
however, has been ‘‘much less
of an insider — Jim Brady was
not; Larry Speakes certainly is
not. They are not insiders and
you know they probably don’t
know much more than they’re
saying.”

Television news can be proud
of its record, Dancy said. ‘‘Our
successes are quiet ones, but
our failures are pretty spec-
tacular...our failures are
right there for everyone to see.”’

As an example, he cited the
three networks’ announcement
that Jim Brady had died of a
bullet wound the day Reagan
was shot in March 1981. Dancy
said NBC had two sources for

 

Journalists examine
controversial topics

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi Staff Writer

Journalists from four states
and the District of Columbia
gathered at Washington and
Lee last weekend for the ninth
annual Ethics in Journalism In-
stitute.

The ethics seminar is part of
the Society and the Professions
program headed by Prof. Louis
Hodges. The program, which in-
cludes seminars on law,
business and medicine, gives
students an opportunity to
discuss their intended profes-
sions with professionals.

NBC News correspondent
John Dancy began the seminar
with a speech on ethics in jour-
nalism Friday night in the Nor-
then Auditorium, discussing the
differences in the Washington
press corps from news
coverage elsewhere. Dancy,
who replaced Douglas Kiker at
the last moment, covers the
senate for NBC. (See separate
story, this page. )

For the following two days,
professionals from both print

and broadcast media invited to
the campus for the seminar and
students in a journalism ethics
class participated in closed
discussions of touchy issues
that journalists encounter.
Eight different seminars were
held for the students and the
professionals to consider. Pro-
fessor Hodges, Professor Mac-
Donald (Chairman of the Jour-
nalism and Communications
Department), and John Dancy
led the discussions which at
times became very heated, ac-
cording to Prof. MacDonald.

“The discussions got very in-
tense,” said MacDonald, “I
can’t honestly say that we came
to total agreement on any one
issue.”’

Issues discussed included
moral questions such as suicide
threats over the running of a
story or law enforcement of-
ficials’ request that media han-
dle stories in a certain manner.
_Another issue that was discuss-
ed was how to handle stories
such as the recent Tylenol
scare.

the story before they used it.
“Within the guidelines of jour-
nalism, we acted prudently. We
were wrong. You’re only as
good as your sources.”’

It’s important, according to
Dancy, that reporters keep
some distance between them-
selves and their sources. Speak-
ing of the Kennedy administra-
tion, he said, ‘“‘Reporters really
did get caught up in Camelot.”’

He says, “‘...there has to be an
adversary relationship. There’s
not enough of an adversary
relationship between the press
and their news sources. I don’t
think we ought to live cheek-by-
jowl with the people we cover
every day.”

Dancy said that media people
as stars is a “‘phenomenon that

is a relatively new one in our
society.’”’ Contracts loaded with
perks and high salaries are be-
ing signed ‘‘as a result of the
star system....That’s ridicu-
lous, that’s ridiculous. It keeps
you from covering real stories.
All it prepares you for is cover-
ing cocktail parties in
Georgetown....”’

This star factor becomes
especially noticeable on the
White House beat, which car-
ries with it a great deal of ex-
posure. Dancy asked who in the
room knew the name of ABC’s
White House correspondent.
Sam Donaldson came quickly to
most people’s minds, and near-
ly every hand in the room went
up. He then asked the name of
ABC’s Senate correspondent.

A freshman perspective

 

J-schoolers bustle
on election night

By TURNER FRIEDMAN
Phi Staff Writer

The room is full and abuzz.
There are television sets and
Associated Press wires and
typewriters. And there are peo-
ple. Pryse Elam, Bruce Potter,
Mike Allen, and Norma Anne
Chittim await the information
they will report. Tori Richard-
son and Allen Roberts are on
the road with the newsmakers,
and Steve Warren, among
others, is frantically wondering
how it’s going to work.

The scene is familiar in
newsrooms throughout the
country on the first Tuesday in
November. And for Washington
and Lee’s Cable Nine, the night
promised challenge and pro-
blems, such astcameras break-
ing down and human error, but
it also promised excitement,
learning. And fun. For a
freshman with an interest in
journalism, there could be no
better initial experience.

“Who won in Alabama,”
“switch that to CBS,”’ and so on
went the hectic voices in Reid
Hall.

The sound of the typewriter
keys saw little respite for some
four hours as stories were writ-
ten to be broadcast almost im-
mediately.

The Associated Press wires
never stopped humming and
Dan Rather’s face became a
more than familiar sight as the

More Dancy

(continued from page 4)
Ignoring the hands of several
who knew it to be Brit Hume,
Dancy said, ‘‘Let the record
show that not a hand in the
room went up.”

Dancy called reporters like
Donaldson ‘‘abusive’’ and
‘“impertinent.’’ He said,

televisions relayed results
around the country.

The excitement was there,
the problems were there, the
TV’s and cameras and type-
writers were there, but, why is
it all so important in Lexington,
Virginia? This may be Lex-
ington, but for those in Reid
Hall last Tuesday night, it
might as well have been New
York City. The experience is
what it was all about. Once that
camera light came on, political
commentators Mike Allen and
Bruce Potter couldn’t have
cared if there were 100 viewers
or 100 million—they were on the
air. And somehow they could
have been forgiven if they fan-
cied themselves, if only briefly,
as sitting in New York and
perhaps discussing with Mr.
Rather just why George
Wallace did win in Alabama.

This hope, dream, or more
probably, just feeling of impor-
tance, is in essence what the
night was all about for those in
Reid Hall.

Sure, Cable Nine was being
broadcast to Lexington, and the
coverage gave the students in-
sights they may not have had
otherwise, but it was the excite-
ment and importance, even in
just relaying information from
the newsroom to the air, that
provoked that sense of impor-
tance, urgency, and satisfaction
that tends to motivate us in our
daily rigors.

 

“There’s a difference between
being rude and doing your
work.”

When he first came to the
podium, Dancy thanked the au-
dience for coming. ‘“‘The way
things are going at NBC,” he
said, “it’s nice to be invited
anyplace.”

Food conference goes well

By TURNER FRIEDMAN
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee was the
sight of the National Associa-
tion of College and University
Food Services (NACUFS) 1982
Region II Conference last week.

The conference, hosted by
W&L’s Director of Food Ser-
vices Gerald Darrell and his
staff, was attended by 104
representatives from schools
from the northeast and as far
south as Davidson.

Compared with the six
previous meetings Darrell has
attended, 104 is a large number,
he said.

The three-day annual
meeting serves as a medium for
the exchange of ideas, opinions
and techniques. This was done
through seminar-type, interest
sessions, workshops, and the
general interaction of the
delegates.

The main theme of the

meeting lay in stress manage-
ment workshops held Wednes-
day. There were also interest
sessions on a variety of subjects
and a resource room with
displays from various schools.
The representatives voiced
strong support for NACUFS and
its benefits. They also spoke
highly of Washington and Lee
and this year’s program. Much
of the praise stemmed from
Darrell’s decision to include the
student body, particularly those
students who eat in Evans Din-
ing Hall, fully in the program.
This was a break from past
meetings, such as 1981 at
Princeton University where the
students were not even on cam-

The food service ad-
ministrators stood in line and
ate all their meals with the
students in Evans Dining Hall,
with the exception of their an-
nual banquet.

The delegates, in gauging
what appeals to students, said
that the main course is more
important than nutrition or
deserts. Darrell confirmed this
regarding Washington and Lee
students, even specifying that
meat and potatoes were the
favorites. He also has found a
large student interest in the
nightly salad bar.

The most heralded part of the
conference came on the first
night with the “Election ’82”
dinner. The theme dinner was
well received by the students
and appealed to the NACUFS

. members enough to win Darrell

a special project award.

The dinner and the con-
ference were made possible by
donations of capital and sup-
plies from about thirty con-
tributors including large dona-
tions by Sandler Foods of
Virginia Beach and Institution
Foods of Lexington.

Frats are told
the ABC’s of ABC

By ROB SCHLEGAL
Phi Staff Writer

‘‘Change your habits.”’

That’s what ABC Supervisor
Bill Burnett had to say to Tues-
day night’s assembly at the
regular Interfraternity Council
meeting.

Drinking in public is now be-
ing strictly enforced, the ABC
offical said. The Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board is
mainly concerned with pro-
blems at Zollman’s Pavilion
and with drinking outside of
fraternity houses. ‘‘We, as
agents of the commission, do
not take drinking in public light-
ly,’ said Rob Reed, Roanoke’s
ABC representative.

In response to questions from
Chi Psi President Danny Ein-
stein and IFC Secretary Pat
Moony, Reed explained, ‘If
you're in sight of public view,
then it’s considered public,”
When containers such as cups
or mugs are used, as opposed to
labeled beer bottles for exam-
ple, then each individual case
must be dealt with differently,
according to Reed.

Why this sudden change in en-
forcement of the ABC laws?
“Times have’ changed,’’
Burnett explained at the
meeting. The public has _ be-
come concerned with parties at
Zollman’s Pavilion. In addition,
the ABC recently initiated an of-
fical hot-line number for com-
plaints about ABC violations.
Burnett pointed out that since
the phone call is free, there are
more complaints than in the
past. He also mentioned that the
ABC is not concerned with
drinking inside fraternity
houses unless there is a com-
plaint. ‘‘If there are complaints,
we have to investigate because
we have to write a report as to
whether or not the law is being
violated,’’ he said.

The topic of Zollman’s Pa-
vilion was a major source of
discussion. ABC officer Driscoll
explained, ‘‘It would be difficult
to have a legal party there.”’ He
pointed out what needs to be
done in order to have a legal
party at Zollman’s, but added
that the easiest thing to do
would be to call the regional of-
fice in Roanoke at least a week
before any proposed party.
Then matters concerning ABC
laws could be clarified in ad-

vance.

EAST L

In reference to Chi Psi’s Rob-
bin Thompson party at Zoll-
man’s last month, Burnett said,
‘There is no way I know of that
what (you) did a month and a
half ago could be made legal
under the laws of the Com-
monwealth of Virginia.”’

Burnett stressed the fact that
unless the only people attending
the party are members of the
fraternity or were invited per-
sonally by a fraternity member,
then the party is open to the
public. According to Burnett
you can’t legally have a party at
Zollman’s when people were in-
vited from all over the county.

University Food Service
director Gerald Darrell has a
public license that allows Evans
Dining Hall to be open to the
public. But in order to obtain
this license the establishment
involved must be a bona fide
restaurant. As for banquet li-
censes, ‘‘That’s a horse of a dif-
ferent color,” said Burnett.

Bob Reed, the regional ABC
officer for this area, emphasiz-
ed that the ABC is willing to
work with fraternities to make
sure they follow the laws. ‘‘We
want to work with you any way
we can,”’ he stated. Reed men-
tioned that the ABC does not
establish the law. ‘‘We don’t try
to influence the law. If the law is
enacted, we enforce it,’’ said
Reed.

Chi Psi President Einstein
asked Burnett if there could be
any mutual understanding
worked out between the ABC
and the fraternities such as
there is between the IFC and
the Lexington Police concern-
ing noise violations. Burnett
responded that he thinks
everyone knows what the laws
are,

He stated, ‘You guys have to
police your fraternity parties.”
He also noted that the ABC is
not going to allow what has been
going on in the past to continue.
This seemed to be the most im-
portant message of the
meeting.

The strict enforcement of
ABC laws does not apply only to
Washington and Lee students.
VMI students, townspeople and
local high school students are
also being affected. ‘‘Nobody is
singling out you guys,” em-
phasized Burnett. ‘‘All we ask is
that you meet us halfway,” he
said.

The EC and dirty laundry

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

The Executive Committee,
which needed only 13 minutes at
last week’s meeting to discuss
its non-honor related work, met
for about 15 minutes Monday
and formed several subcom-
mittees.

Subcommittees were formed
to study the long-term use of the
EC’s new breathalyzer, the con-
ditions of the washers and
dryers in Graham-Lees dorms
and the possible extension of the
drop-add period.

President Bennett Ross open-
ed the meeting by saying that
he had received some “good
comments’? on the Alcohol
Awareness Week. In conjuction
with that, a breathalyzer was
given to the EC by the Dean of
Students’ Office. A subcom-
mittee consisting of sophomore
representative Dave Jonson
and secretary Mike Singer was
formed to study the long-term
uses of the breathalyzer.

Freshman representative
Steve Connett remarked that he
had received several com-
plaints from freshmen regar-

ding the washer-dryer situation
in the basement of Graham-
Lees dormitory. According to

Junior representative Scott Mason argues for more time to
drop/add. (Phi photo by David Sprunt)

Connett, there are too few
washers and dryers, and there
is actually one more washer
than dryer.

He commented that freshmen
have enough to do without hav-
ing to worry about where to
wash their clothes. Senior
representative Pete Baum-
gaertner said that there was
probably not enough room in
the washroom for additional
units. Connett replied that he
felt the soda machines were un-
necessary and was appointed to
talk to Jerry Darrell to get
some information on the pro-
blem.

  

Scott Mason, junior represen-
tative, brought up one student’s
suggestion of extending the
drop-add period to two weeks.
That period is currently the
first week of every term. Mason
said that other schools have a
two-week period, and he called
the $10 drop-add fee a “‘ripoff.”’

Jonson and Mason were ap-
pointed by the EC to study the
situation further.

Ross announced that the
budget hearing will begin next
week with reports from the Cold
Check Committee and the
Emergency Loan Committee.

 

 

Tests heighten awareness

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

“Trying to find the highest
pitch of pleasure from drinking
before the needle goes over the
line,” is how Associate Dean of
Students Robert Huntley
described the point of Alcohol
Awareness Week. The needle
that Huntley is referring to is
the one on the breathalyzer that
the university has bought and
the one in the student’s mind
that indicates to him when he
has had too much to drink.

The Virginia Legislature pro-
claimed Nov. 1 - 7 Alcohol
Awareness Week and W&L
marked the event with a 3-day
symposium that included a
testing of eight subjects to show
the effects of drinking on the
body chemistry. There was also
a home beer-brewing demon-
stration, a non-alcoholic drinks
demonstration and an alcohol
trivia quiz program between

the Young Democrats and Col-
lege Republicans.

The coordinator of the pro-
gram, Dean Huntley, considers
Alcohol Awareness ‘‘one more
area that we would like the
students to become conversant
with; ...using alcohol is a matter
of self-regulation.”’ He noted,
that while many other colleges
are trying to introduce alcohol
regulations to student bodies,
“there is no intention of doing
that here.”’

The impetus for W&L’s
specific program was a drink-
ing survey conducted by the Ex-
ecutive Committee last year
which several members of the
EC found disconcerting. The
survey found that there were
unusually large numbers of
students who reported having
five drinks every day. Eric
Myers, last year’s student body
president, worked especially
hard to make ‘‘alcohol orienta-

tion as much a fact of academic
orientation,” said Huntley.

However, Huntley said,
‘drinking patterns are not any
more pronounced here than at
any other college...(although)
there is a macho psychology
that each student body is the
hardest drinking one.”

The various aspects of the
program received generally
small but attentive audiences.
As for concrete results from the
week-long program, Huntley
said he would like to see renew-
ed interest in the possibility of
the university building a
pavilion of its own. Citing the
hazardous road to Zollman’s
Pavilion and the possibility of
an accident similar to the one
that happened to several VMI
cadets as two motives for a
pavilion, Huntley said ‘“‘it’s
something I'd like to see the two
schools explore jointly.”’

W&L loses institution as Munger retires

(continued from page 1)

trifugal force their absence
creates. Where are the
students’ minds? Monday they
talk of the previous weekend,
and by Tuesday they’re already
planning the next weekend.
Yes, girls like parties, but they
are not party objects only. In
the same speech at Orientation,
I warn the freshmen about
women. ‘Someday,’ I say, ‘you
may have a woman boss.’ But
W&L guys will be at a disadvan-
tage. They have had no day-to-
day work situtations with girls
during college. I’ve talked with
countless professors who have
said women would add to the
class discussion. They would.”’

She lit a cigarette, but she
continued talking before she
took a draw.

“T have a theory. When
Robert E. Lee came here, he
looked at Washington College
and he looked at the world. He
then redesigned Washington
College in terms of the society
of that day. If he were here now,
I think he would probably look
at the world again and see
women’s roles as different, as a
greater part of men’s lives than
in 1866,”’ she said, stopping just
short of saying he’d advocate
going coed to get at her burning
cigarette.

She needed no deep breath to
start over gain.

“Millions are spent here on
improving minds and bodies,
the intellectual and_ the
physical; the third part to rela-
tionships — the emotional — is
not here. It doesn’t exist here.
And that makes W&L unreal.”’

Such opinions distinguish
Munger from many on campus.
Besides being an ardent
feminist, she is also a dyed-in-
the-wool Democrat.

What does she think of the
President?

“T’m a Democrat, and that
should tell you what I think,”’
she replied frankly.

Is Nancy Reagan on her black
list also?

“T think she’s awfully tacky,”
she muttered behind her hand
so no one would hear her,
although no one was around.
‘Jackie Kennedy had elegance,
and the Kennedy White House
knew how to throw a party. She
was the best first lady.”

Then she must despise Milli-
cent Fenwick.

“Oh I love Millicent Fenwick.
What a gutsy gal. She believes

 

‘‘Millions are spent here on improving minds and
bodies, the intellectual and the physical; the third
part to relationships — the emotional — is not here. It
doesn’t exist here. And that makes W&L unreal.”’

— Betty Munger

in what she’s doing,” she
stated. ‘‘I’d do what she’s doing,
but for different reasons.”

“There has been one
Republican I have considered
voting for, and_ that’s
Goldwater. He came to the
bookstore once and bought $40
worth of books. I talked with
him, and found him to be sur-
prisingly intellectual. Sharp,
really sharp.”

Now it is the nuclear arms
question that raises Munger’s
ire.

“I’m very anti-nuclear. The
obsession with nuclear might
has become a sort of dictator-
ship in this country. But unlike
Ghengis Khan, who killed
thousands, the nuclear dictator-
ship will also destroy the earth.

“The earth cannot survive a
nuclear war,” she emphatically
stated. “It is man’s brain
destroying himself. I guess as a

A second cigarette was lit.

“Forty-three years ago I left
my home in Massachusetts and
went to New Orleans. I worked
and taught at the Tulane Med
school for two years, specializ-
ing in surgery techniques and
procedure. Orleans then had air
conditioning in only one store in
the entire city — the Jung Hotel
coffee shop. We drank four or
five cokes a day instead. I work-
ed in a lab with a young doctor
there, and we'd pitch pennies
for buying the drinks. I’d win 80
percent of the time. He always
got mad, I remember,” re-
counted Munger. ‘His name
was Michael DeBakey.”’

DeBakey went on to become
one of the nation’s premier
surgeons.

While aspiring to be a practi-
tioner, the young lady never

progressed beyond being a lab
technician at Harvard. After
marrying a young doctor nam-
ed Peter Munger, she took to
the road with him and settled in
Lexington in the fall of 1941.

As a northern white woman in
a deeply racial South, Munger
admits ‘‘it took me a long time
to understand the white feeling
about blacks.”

“The whites would entrust
their children to black care —
their children, their dearest
possessions, and yet they
wouldn’t let the blacks vote
without paying a poll tax.”

“T’ll always remember the
first maid we had. I always call-
ed her Mrs. Whatever-her-
name-was. Well, my mother-in-
law took me aside one day and
told me that black women
should always be called by their
first names. What a shock for a
northerner!’ she exclaimed.

While she holds strong views

on drinking among youth,
Munger relishes memories of
her earlier days and her first
experiences with alcohol.

“T’ll always remember the
first time I had a drink, a
highball, to be exact. When I
came home, Father said he
hoped I never had more than
one or they would never be able
to shut me up!”’ she said. ‘‘We
drank beer, but not much.
Didn’t have the money.”

Without any prompting, she
jumped into a new topic.

‘‘We had no television. I think
it’s sterile. You put nothing in.
Today’s students are the first
generation of _ television-
babysat kids. Vocabularies are
deficient and attitudes are
limited.”’

Over the years. Munger has
created a faithful cadre of ad-
mirers. Among them is Pro-
fessor Sidney Coulling, with
whose wife Munger co-founded
the local league of women
voters.

“‘She’s unique. She’s wonder-
ful, superb, personal. She has
great energy,” Coulling said of
Munger. “I have only super-
latives when I speak of Betty
Munger.”’

Co-workers in the bookstore
agree with the English pro-
fessor’s assessment.

“Betty? She’s understanding
and easy to work for,’’ said
Ruby Earhart, a_behind-the-
scenes worker in the textbook
room downstairs.

Even among the students who
work for her there are no bad
words.

“She knows so many things
about so many different topics.
Intellectual beyond a doubt,”’
Nick Leitch (84A) says. ‘‘She’s
a character, a step above a per-
son.”

But somewhere beyond that
lies the real Betty Munger,
Bookstore manager, Betty
Munger, lover of life and living.

“I think most everybody is
extraordinary. Everybody has
a story. Everyone contributes
to the past, present, and future,
and yes, we all are scared of
every day together,’ she said.

‘I’m just a people’s person. I
like people. They’re my source
of interest and concern, a con-
cern which must come from in-
side. I guess everybody needs a
gift of laughter that the world is
mad, a sense of wonder of the
infinite variety around us.
Life’s never dull. It’s never
dull.’’

William Schaufele

Tuesday

Ex-ambassador speaks

The EC-IFC funded speakers
program kicks off the year’s
program with Ambassador Wil-
liam E. Schaufele Jr.

The one-time U.S. Am-
bassador to Poland will lecture
on ‘Poland and Foreign
Policy,” Monday, Nov. 15, at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. The event is
open to the public .

Schaufele was born in Lake-
wood, Ohio, on Dec. 7, 1923.
After three years of military du-
ty during World War II in which

mored Division in Europe, he
received his A.B. Degree from
Yale University in 1948 and a
master’s degree in interna-
tional affairs from Columbia
University’s School of Interna-
tional Affairs in 1950. He
entered the United States
Foreign Service the same year.

During a 30-year Foreign Ser-
vice career Schaufele served in
a wide variety of posts in Ger-
many, Morocco, the Congo
(now Zaire) and the State
‘Department. In 1969 he became
Ambassador to the West
African Republic of Upper
Volta, where he served for two
years.

From 1971 to 1975 Am-
bassador Schaufele was assign-

and to the United Nations in
New York, where he serverd
succeessively as Senior Adviser
to the Permanent Represen-

sibility for coordinating the
work of the permanent U.S.
Mission and of U.S. delegations
to the annual sessions of the
General Assembly. In
November 1975, after a_ brief
tour of duty as Inspector
General of the U.S. Foreign Ser-

by President Ford as Assistant
Secretary of State for African
Affairs, heading the State

Harriers win ODAC

The Washington and Lee
cross country team and Coach
Dick Miller each achieved a
first this past Saturday as the
harriers won the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Champion-
ship race.

Led by junior Angus McBryde |

(Charlotte, N.C.) and sopho-
more Frank Pittman (Atlanta,
Ga.), the Generals tallied 45
points to squeak by defending
champion Roanoke College’s 51
points and Lynchburg College’s
53 to capture the crown for the
first time in the ODAC’s seven-
year history. Catholic Universi-
ty (87), Bridgewater (134),
Eastern Mennonite (159) and
Hampden-Sydney (197) round-
ed out the field.

“TI couldn’t have asked for a
better performance,’’ com-
mented Miller, who was select-
ed at the meet as conference
Coach-of-the-Year by the other
coaches. “‘It was simply a case
of how much everybody wanted
the title. Our runners wanted it
more than the other runners.”

McBryde placed second and
Pittman fifth in the 56-runner
field to earn All-Conference
honors, which are given to the
top seven finishers. McBryde
turned in a time of 26:57 for the
8000-meter course, just 17
seconds behind Runner-of-the-
Year Grattan Garbee from

Lynchburg; Pittman clocked in
at 27:35. Senior Captain Jon
Kelafant (Staunton, Va.) placed
ninth, freshman Bob Glenn (Ro-
anoke, Va.) 12th, and freshman
Ron Moody (Brewton, Ala.;
17th to complete W&L’s scoring.

McBryde, Pittman, Kelafant,
Glenn, Moody, along with junior
Paul Chapman (Short Hills,
N.J.) and sophomore Mark
Pembroke (Shorewood, Wis.)
will travel this Saturday to
Lynchburg College to compete
in the NCAA Division III South
Regional Qualifying meet.
Fourteen teams may compete
in the race; the top two teams
and top three individuals not
associated with those teams
will earn spots in the NCAA
Division III Championships to
be held November 20 at Fre-
donia (N.Y.) State College.
W&L placed fourth in last
year’s qualifying meet held in
Nashville, Tenn.

The conference crown is
W&L’s first cross country title
of any kind since 1972 when the
team won the College Athletic
Conference meet. Miller’s
award is the first such honor he
has captured in his 31 years as
the General’s coach. Previous-
ly, the harriers’ best ODAC per-
formance has been fourth
place.

The W&L water polo Generals
showed the stuff champions are
made of last weekend as they
swept through the Southern
League Championsips to the
finals where they outclassed a
bewildered Richmond team to
take the title.

Along the way to the cham-
pionship game, the Generals
posted victories over Duke
(16-5), UNC-Wilmington (14-4),
George Washington (12-1), and
Virginia (22-6). The five wins
closed out an unblemished 13-0
slate for Southern League play
and upped their overall season
record to 25-7.

“There was a matter of pride
involved in the Richmond
game,” said fourth-year head
coach Page Remillard. “We
believed we were the better
team, and we wanted to make
sure nobody else misunderstood
who was the better team,” he
added, emphasizing the intensi-

ty that was present during the
weekend. “You could see the
pressure evolving during the
week,’’ noted Remillard, speak-
ing of the players demanding
the very best of themselves for
the championships.

The very best is what Coach
Remillard got from every
member of his squad through-
out the tournament. Even subs
like Keith Kadesky, Scott
Johnstone and Scott Van Meter
turned in stellar performances
in tight situations. Remillard
cited the Generals’ team unity
as another key to W&L’s suc-
cess.

The championship pairing
between Richmond and W&L
was what the Generals were
waiting for. W&L was seeking
revenge for their loss to the
Spiders in the Virginia State
Championships the week prior.
The Generals persevered and
forced Richmond into
numerous second half
mistakes. Rebounding from a

Booters end season
with 3-0 victory

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team closed out the season
last Tuesday with a 3-0 home
victory over Virginia Wesleyan
College to end the year at 8-3-2.
Seniors Tad Renner (Raleigh,
N.C.) and Tom Elder (Norfolk,
Va.) and sophomore Rob Cole-
man (St. Louis, Mo.) each
scored once to lead the
Generals’ effort.

‘“‘We took the steps, achieved
the goals we set out to achieve
this fall,’ offered seventh-year
coach Rolf Piranian. ‘‘We were
in the thick of the conference
race (finishing 3-1-2 to tie for se-
cond place), stayed in the
NCAA Division III play-off pic-
ture most of the season, and
came up just short of making
VISA (Virginia Intercollegiate
Soccer Association) tourna-
ment.”

Piranian cites the team’s six
seniors as the major con-
tributors to the squad’s success.
“We said before the season
began that to be successful we’d
have to get good play and
leadership from the seniors.
They lived up to that challenge.
They’re the best seniors I’ve
worked with.”

Five seniors — Elder at for-
ward, Renner on defense, Kirk
Mancer (Philadelphia, Pa.) in

the goal, Brad Poorman

(Miami, Fla.) at forward, and
Mark Carduner (Hightstown,
Pa.) at midfield — started
throughout the season. Backing
up at forward was classmate
(Hilton Head

Jerry Moyer
Island, S.C.).

Poorman led the team in
goals scored with 10 while he,
Carduner, and Moyer each had
four assists on the season. Elder
chipped in four goals, Carduner
two, and Renner one en route to
setting a W&L season record for
most goals (38). Mancer col-
lected 71 saves while allowing
just 11 goals for a save average
of 87 percent. He finished his
career with 11 shutouts to tie
with Kevin Carney. (1980) for
the team record in that
category.

Piranian is quick to compli-
ment the efforts of the under-
classmen. ‘‘Graduating five
starters might lead people to
say we'll be weak next fall. But
our junior, sophomore, and
freshman classes all have a
good nucleus. We’ll continue to
be competitive and successful.”
Junior Roland Simon (Edge-
wood, Md.), who collected three
goals this fall, and Coleman,
who had four, have been named
as captains for the 1983 squad.

 

- 5-3 halftime deficit,

W&L
outscored UR 10-2 in the second
half to take a 13-7 victory and
the championship.

Pacing the Generals on the
weekend were sophomore Bob-
by Pearson with 12 goals, junior
Matt Ravencraft with 14 goals,
and senior scoring force Erik
Peterson, who led the team with
16.

This weekend the Generals -
travel to Indianapolis, Indiana
for the Eastern Championships,
where they are seeded sixth.
Remillard promises that the
team hasn’t reached its peak
yet and has the ability to get to
the finals. The Generals’ first
round opponent will be Navy,
who has beaten W&L by a total
of five goals in two contests.
‘“‘We are confident that we can
beat Navy,” said Coach Re-
millard, adding, ‘‘It will
show just how tough our nucleus

Generals whitewash Cardinals

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Sports Writer

W&L’s senior football players
made their final performance
on Wilson Field a memorable
one as the Generals obliterated
Catholic University 41-0 Satur-
day.
‘We had a good week of prac-
tice,’ observed W&L Coach
Gary Fallon. “We seemed to
have a lot of enthusiasm. It was
an enjoyable game for the
players. It was one of those
days you hope never ends,” he
concluded.

W&L raised its record to 4-4
with one game remaining.
Catholic sustained its third
defeat against five wins.

W&L dominated the game
from the outset. W&L’s
sophomore quarterback John
Thompson connected with
senior tailback Chris Cavalline
on a spectacular 62-yard
touchdown pass at 12:57 of the
first quarter to give the
Generals a 7-0 lead.

Cavalline ran a delay pattern
against the grain, and caught
the ball about five yards
downfield in the right flat. He
left the linebacker who was
covering him in the dirt, and
then blew past a Catholic
defender another 40 yards
downfield to go into the endzone
untouched.

“That long pass from Thomp-
son to Cavalline was what ig-
nited us. I think that was the
key to what was to follow,”’ said
Fallon.

The next time W&L touched
the ball the Generals increased
their lead to 10-0. A 16-yard gain
on a pass from junior Al
Paradise to sophomore Gene
Girard, and a _ subsequent
Catholic penalty for a late hit,
were the key features of the
drive. Senior Bill Devine cap-
ped the drive with a 22-yard
field goal with 2:33 left in the
quarter.

On the next play from scrim-
mage, W&L senior defensive
back Gene Fellin made a leap-
ing interception of a Catholic
pass at the Cardinal 47-yard
line. The Generals could not
move the ball though, and it ap-
peared they would lose posses-
sion. However, Catholic was
charged with roughing the
kicker, and the Generals picked
up 15 yards and a first down.

After the penalty, senior
Steve Corbeille hauled in a pass
from Thompson at the 7-yard
line, hanging onto the ball
despite taking a vicious hit. One
play later, Thompson connected
with Sophomore Ian Banwell on
a 4-yard touchdown pass to give
W&L a 17-0 lead six seconds into
the second quarter.

An interception return by
senior defensive back Marty
Thomas set up the next W&L
touchdown. A two play drive
was topped off by Al Paradise’s
3-yard touchdown sneak with
9:33 left in the half. The extra
point gave the Generals a com-
manding 24-0 lead at the half.

W&L slowed down a little in

the third quarter, only scoring
three more points. Bill Devine
nailed his eighth field goal of
the season, a school record,
from 41 yards out at 12:51 of the
third quarter to increase the
lead to 27-0.

W&L continued the carnage
when Al Paradise scored on a
10-yard run with 12:02 in the
game to give W&L a gaudy 34-0
lead. Freshman Frank Surface
picked up a key first down in a
fourth down situation to keep
the drive going.

Midway through the fourth
quarter W&L put the finishing
touches on their biggest shutout

Swimming with Olympians

By LEE NICHOLS
Phi Sports Editor

Another successful water polo
season is drawing to a close, the
product of long hours and hard
work which began the very first
week of school. But for Head
Coach Page Remillard and
three W&L players, water polo
action began in the middle of
July in Indianapolis, Indiana,
the site of the 1982 National
Sports Festival.

Sponsored by the National
Olympic Committee, the Na-
tional Sports Festival gives
hopefuls for the 1984 Olympics a
chance to demonstrate their
abilities in a nation-wide com-
petition. Thousands of athletes
from across the nation par-
ticipate in 33 different sporting
events ranging from archery to
yachting, with the Olympic
Committee picking up the tab
for all travel expenses and ac-
commodations.

Among those participating in
the Festival were Remillard
and three of his star per-
formers: senior Erik Peterson
and juniors Rand McClain and
Matt Ravencraft. Remillard,
who served last year as assis-

tant coach of the East team,
was chosen to skipper the South
squad this year. Among the
players he had to work with
were Peterson, McClain and
Ravencraft, who were chosen to
participate in the Festival bas-
ed upon their performance in
water polo at the collegiate
level.

Remillard knew that he and
his team had their work cut out
for them, for in the previous
four years the South Team had
been unable to win even a single
match in the round-robin event.
The team faced an imposing
task, but rose to the occasion.

When the water had finally
calmed, the South had ac-
complished what no one had
thought possible. Not only did
they win their first match ever;
they continued to win until final-
ly bowing to a powerful West
team in the Championship
game.

The fact that the South team
turned in such an admirable
performance was_ naturally
rewarding to the coaches and
players. But according to
Remillard, just participating in
the Festival was reward

enough. ‘‘Being the coach of the
South team was the ultimate
coaching experience short of
the Olympics. For the players,
the Festival was the ultimate in
participation due to the national
recognition it generated.”’

“This was a very emotional
experience for Erik, Rand and
Matt, as well as all the other
athletes. Several of the boys
were fighting back tears of joy
after the championship game
was over.” Remillard also
states that the Festival was a
great deal of fun. ‘‘I was asked
to sign autographs, as were
several of my players. The fans
in Indianapolis were great...
they were especially ap-
preciative of the high level of
competition.”’

One thing that Remillard is
quick to point out is something
that he has known all along
—that W&L has athletes
capable of competing on the na-
tional level. ‘Our boys found
out that they can compete on a
level with many athletes that
are on scholarship at big
universities. They’re as good as
anyone else.”’

 

win since 1961 with a touchdown
set up by another Marty
Thomas interception. Frank
Surface rolled 10 yards for a
touchdown and the 41-0 final
margin of victory.

Defensively, the Generals
completely shut down the
highly touted Catholic offense
all day. W&L held Catholic to
-18 yards rushing and _in-
tercepted five Cardinal passes.

Coach Fallon was extremely
proud of his team’s perfor-
mance, and especially of his
seniors. ‘“‘That’s what they are
made of. I was really proud and
glad for the team,”’ he stated.

W&L plays their final game of
the season Saturday versus
Georgetown University in
Washington D.C. The Generals
must win the game to finish
with a 5-4 record and their third
consecutive winning season.
“We can’t go up there thinking
Georgetown is just going to lay

down. We want to go up there
with a confident attitude, not a
cocky attitude,” Fallon stated.

For some of W&L’s players,
Saturday’s game will be their
first experience playing on ar-
tificial turf. Not only is
Georgetown’s Kehoe Field
covered with artificial grass,
but the field is located on top of
a building. ‘‘We call it playing
on an aircraft carrier,’’
remarked Fallon.

Fallon indicated that he will
probably continue to rotate his
quarterbacks and running
backs as he did in the Catholic
game. ‘“‘We’ve got some dif-
ferent talent that the defense
has got to gear up against,”’ ex-
plained Fallon.

Georgetown is also 4-4 on the
season. They lost two weeks ago
to Catholic 19-18. The series be-
tween W&L and Georgetown is
tied at 9-9.

 

Freshman running back Frank Surface looks to the sidelines as
the officials unanimously indicate that he has in fact crossed the
goal line.
