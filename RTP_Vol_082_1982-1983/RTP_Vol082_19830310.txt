Sophomore charged with

possession of cocaine

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

A sophomore at Washington
and Lee University was ar-
rested and charged with posses-
sion of cocaine with intent to
distribute following an_ in-
vestigation by city and state
police that began in mid-
December.

Charles M. Phillips, of Mont-
clair, N.J., was arrested by
state police on Feb. 4 after they
had. stopped his car on In-
terstate 81 near Natural Bridge,
according to Officer Steven E.
Crowder of the Lexington
Police Department.

Approximately one ounce of
cocaine with a street value of
$2,400 was found in Phillips’
car, Crowder said.

Crowder said the department
became suspicious of Phillips
when it received information
alleging that he was sending
large sums of money to various
places in the country. Phillips
also reportedly picked up
packages at the Greyhound Bus

Station on Waddell Street that
had come by Federal Express,
he said.

Crowder said the tip came
from an informant but would
not elaborate.

Both Crowder and state police
kept Phillips under surveillance
after Christmas break.

Crowder said police were
aware that Phillips sent $1,000
to Florida. On Feb. 4 state
police followed him to the
Roanoke airport where he
allegedly picked up a package
that had arrived by Federal Ex-
press, he said.

Phillips then was followed un-
til he entered Rockbridge Coun-
ty, where his car was pulled
over by state police and search-
ed with a narcotics dog.

Phillips was released from
the Rockbridge County jail ona
$1,500 bond. A_ preliminary
hearing has been scheduled for
March 25 in the county General
District Court.

EC Elections

Jenevein

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

Junior class: president Bob
Jenevein edged Executive Com-
mittee secretary Mike Singer in
last Thursday’s balloting to win
the position of EC president for
next year.

Jenevein garnered 386 votes
to Singer’s 327. The two had
earned spots in the runoff by
beating out Markham Pyle and
Gov Slahor the preceding Mon-
day.
Dave Judge had already won
the vice presidential spot easily
over two write-in candidates,
and Len Howard was elected
secretary over no opposition.
Neither of those races required

and the use of an extra band. An
additional entrance into the old
gym worked to ease the crowd-
ed conditions experienced last
year, but Haywood said the
most important change came in
the decorating process.

‘“‘We learned as many skills
as we could. We did everything,
we didn’t hire anyone. We even
cut.the lattice strips ourselves
for the new gym. Obviously, it
paid off.”’

After last year’s deficit of
over $20,000, the 1983 F.D.
budget was the most-watched
aspect of the operation. Though
figures will not be tallied for at
least a week, Haywood did
volunteer: ‘We have no fear of

losing money. We will be in the
black.”

Ticket sales among students
increased ‘‘a little over last
year,’’ and though the Student
Activities Board has not com-
pleted the count, the sales were
within the range budgeted by
the SAB. A big boost, said
Haywood, was alumni sales;
which increased 50 percent over
Diamond Jubilee sales to grad-
uates. The memorabilia for this
Ball also sold ‘“‘very well.’’ The
complete allotment of 1100 T-
shirts was sold early last week.
This year, the SAB was the only
organization selling shirts. The
posters and grain cups also sold
well, and for those who did not
obtain them, the surplus will go
on sale shortly.

takes presidency

a Thursday runoff.

Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting was highlighted by
budget reports, some infighting
over Fancy Dress, and a Mock
Convention monopoly request.

Jim Falk, co-editor of the
Political Review, reported that
several writers had been given
extensions and that the publica-
tion would be printed and
distributed in mid-April. Falk
expects to obtain 14 to 18 ar-
ticles, although he was not able
to get articles from Virginia
Senators John Warner and Paul
Trible as previously hoped.

The chairman of Focus, Chris
Bouquet, reported that the fall
issue of the Excelsior, publish-
ed as an insert to the ‘‘Ring-tum

Phi,’’ cost $200. The winter
issue will be printed shortly
after the March 25 deadline for
articles.

The subject of this spring’s
symposium is scheduled to be
future and technology, and Bou-
quet is currently looking into
the possibility of getting
speakers in that area.

Although the final results will
not be known until next week,
Fancy Dress was ‘‘much closer
to our budget than we were last
year,’’ according to Len
Howard.

Approximately 1400 tickets
were sold before the ball, in-
cluding 160 to alumni. Money
was also saved because the ser-
vices of buildings and grounds
were only required for four
hours on Saturday morning to
clean up. The Student Activities
Board had hired seven students
to work from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m.
after the ball to clean up the
gym.

Howard reported that Coach
Dick Miller was pleased be-
cause there was very little
damage to the gym.

EC President Bennett Ross
then mentioned that he and vice
president Morgan Griffith were
the only two members who
helped the SAB when asked.
Ross said he had told the SAB
he could get all the members to
help out for at least an hour and
criticized those who did not
help. ;

Coimmentary

The lost students

By TODD SMITH
Special to the Phi
‘*.. Tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.”’
—from Hamlet, I:i

They call these the suicide
months in the dorms at big
universities, but, fortunately,
not at Washington and Lee.

Winter does bring depression
to W&L, though less
dramatically. A student doesn’t
come back after Christmas.
Another doesn’t come back
after winter break. Another is
skipping class today.

And no one notices.

The dining hall table I sat at
freshman year, ’79-’80, was
strange. You might say the
guys honked. But they were
charged up about being here
and ready to fight their way into
the system. I remember their
campaign to coeducate the
school. Give up, go with the
flow, I wanted to tell them.

Except for me and one more
fellow, the 6 or 7 at that table
are all gone now. I wonder who
noticed their departure.

In this search for the disap-
pearing student, we might turn
to the faculty for leadership. We
might also be disappointed.

“T have found that a student
has the ability to make himself
or break himself,” a professor
told me the other day. Another
professor told me last term, of a
freshman advisee who was
skipping most of his classes, ‘‘I
kind of gave him a kick in the
pants, told him how many peo-
ple were busting their asses for
him, and how he was just throw-
ing it away. But it didn’t seem
to sink in.”’

For some reason, W&L iden-
tifies with the big university,
which promises no such thing as
personal attention, instead of
with the small school, which
promises no such thing as
privacy. Those of us who ever
evaded the parietal police at a
womans’ college might agree

Letter

 

Stable for Stachura?

To the Editor:

Say, who’s responsible for let-
ting Mike Stachura out of the
barnyard? His arrogantly ig-
norant and aggressively obnox-
ious “Time Out...” which ap-
peared in last week’s Phi makes
one wonder how he pecks his
typewriter keys for the goose
feathers.

Herschel’s ‘‘infamous mis-
take’’ wasn’t in foregoing a
diploma for the USFL, it was in
not doing it sooner and for more
money. Herschel is a football
player, and three varsity letters
from the University of Georgia
are more impressive than an
Athens diploma, and of relative-
ly equal significance academ-

with such an alignment, and
sacrifice unity for privacy, but
the fact is that there are
students wasting away around
us. No one is reaching out to
them.

Sure, they can’t be rescued.
But reaching out is something
we do for ourselves, to become
intelligent, interested people.

This exercise in compassion
is no liberal idea, but rather a
way of rehabilitating the school,
restoring the sense of communi-
ty that I know was here when
my father was here. It is time to
snap back from the ‘‘individual-
ism,’ more appropriately the
‘isolationism,”’ of the 1960s.

How?

Reinvigorating the campus
with a sense of intellectual pur-
pose and unity could not be
achieved by Focus, a thinking
man’s mock convention (Dr.
Barry Machado suggested nam-
ing it the Mock Intellectual
Symposium). Perhaps, but not
probably, unity can be restored
by the proposed curriculum
revisions, which the faculty is
now scratching over.

At a University Council
meeting, Dr. Lad Sessions said
the proposal’s extra course re-
quirements could be perceived
as indication of the faculty’s
concern for the students.

But senior Chris Stokes asked
why the faculty couldn’t show
its concern by just telling the
advisees to take a lab science or

a language.
One reason, I think, is that the
advisor-advisee _ relationships

are more shallow than they
could be. And we could use
fewer professors who post
something like ‘‘10:30 — 11:00”
under the inaccurate title ‘‘Of-
fice Hours.”’

The responsibility for the first
step lies with the ones who know
what’s what in college educa-
tion, that is, the faculty.

Their excellence is not at
stake. The question is: Where
are they leading us?

ically. College football is big
business these days, and
Herschel was in it to win. Now
he is rich and playing in a
league good enough to hold him
to 60 yards his first day.

And if the SAB’s opinion of
our athletic complex is that of a
“party ground,”’ then perhaps
Mr. Stachura should transfer to
UGA, where the athletic
grounds cost alot more than 5
million dollars and the class-
rooms make quite adequate
grounds for parties.

Sincerely,
Robert J. Kelly

features W&L student’s work

By BILL ROBERTS
Editor-in-Chief

Washington and Lee senior
Pryse Elam played an impor-
tant role in an ABC News in-
vestigation of Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft contracts with
the United States Air Force.

The six-week investigation
resulted in a special ABC pro-
duction, which was partly film-
ed in Elam’s hometown of
Oklahoma City, Okla. The first
report from their inquiry will be
broadcast tonight on ABC’s
20/20 at 10:00 p.m.

“The basic thrust of this in-
vestigation is that we have got
some very strong evidence in-
dicating that Pratt and Whitney
executives have been charging
questionable expenses to De-
partment of Defense con-
tracts,’ Elam said Monday
night.

One of the expenses in ques-
tion is a $67,500 contribution by
the Government Products Divi-
sion of Pratt and Whitney Air-
craft to the Oklahoma Art
Center, where the wife of
recently retired Air Force Ma-
jor General J.T. Edwards is a
trustee.

In the spring of 1982, General
Edwards solicited the $67,500
gift from Frank W. McAbee Jr.,
president of the Government
Products Division in West Palm
Beach, Fla. At the time, Ed-
wards was the commanding of-
ficer of Tinker Air Force Base
near Oklahoma City, which is
one of Pratt and Whitney’s
primary contractors.

Pratt and Whitney company
records show the $67,500 was
originally contributed from a
business overhead account of
the Government Products Divi-
sion rather than from the cor-
poration’s gift fund.

Less than one month after the
Art Center was sent a check for
$67,500, an internal watchdog
revort at Tinker AFB showed

that Pratt and Whitney has
retroactively applied  un-
justified price increases on air-
craft engine parts sold to the
Air Force,

The report, filed,on July 12,
1982 by Robert S. Hancock,
deputy chief of the commodity
division of the Air Logistics
Center at Tinker AFB, states
the Pratt and Whitney repricing
will result in a 300 percent cost
increase exceeding $140 million
for fiscal 1982.

As. commanding officer of the
base, Edwards was responsible
for supervising the monitors on
Pratt and Whitney’s contract
performance.

Tonight’s 20/20 broadcast will
explore the circumstances of

Pratt and Whitney’s charitable
contribution within the broad
context of the company’s pric-
ing policies on defense con-
tracts.

Elam got into the 20/20 in-
vestigation through Pulitzer
Prize winner and investigative
reporter for the Washington
Times , Clark R. Mollenhoff,
who is currently a professor of
law and journalism at
Washington and Lee.

“I started off on an indepen-
dent research project with
Mollenhoff in January,’’ Elam
said. “I was writing analyses
for Mollenhoff to use as back-
ground for his stories in the
Washington Times.”’

Tri-chairmen prepare Mock Convention 84

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

“Tt should be the biggest
weekend of the year.”’

So Tri-Chairman Steven
Lewis describes the 1984
Democratic Mock Convention
at Washington and Lee, for
which planning has begun.

The event, which is scheduled
for May 11 and 12, 1984, is
described by United Press In-
ternational as ‘‘the nation’s
most accurate mock conven-
tion.”’

Held in the spring before
every presidential election, the
convention momentarily cap-
tures the eyes of the nation to
predict the out-of-power party’s
presidential nomination.

Since 1908, W&L_ students
have correctly predicted the na-
tion’s choice 12 out of 17 times,
missing only once in the last
nine elections.

 

 

Sweet Briar
gets 7th

president

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer

Dr. Nenan Eleanor Fry has
been appointed the seventh
president of Sweet Briar Col-
lege, effective August 1. Fry,
dean of the college and pro-
fessor of history at Wells Col-
lege, will replace retiring Sweet
Briar president, Harold B.
Whiteman.

Victor W: Henningsen, Chair-
man of the Board of Directors,
announced Fry’s appointment
February 15, noting that ‘‘she
brings to Sweet Briar great
academic and administrative
skills ‘gained through many
years of experience in women’s
higher education.”’

Fry, who received her doc-
torate in history from Yale
University, has previously serv-
ed at Wilson College, a women’s
school in Pennsylvania,

Washington and Lee presi-
dent John D. Wilson, himself a
former president of Wells Col-
lege, said he had no speculation
of what Fry might do at Sweet
Briar. He called her an “ar-
ticulate, dignified, tall and at-
tractive’’ woman, noting
especially her strong speaking
abilities.

“T’m very happy Miss Fry
has been appointed president at
Sweet Briar, and I hope she is
successful there,’ he said.
Wilson had taken part in the hir-
ing of Fry at Wells in the spring
of 1975 but left for his position as
provost at Virginia Tech before
Fry joined the Wells faculty
that fall.

 

 

The student body will be
divided into 50 state caucuses
which will be made up of stu-
dents native to each state. A
prediction based on research
will be made by each state
caucus and a nomination may
be earned with a simple majori-
ty of the 1300 delegates’ votes.

A steering committee made
up of 20 law and undergraduate
students was selected in
February, the members of
which will chair several sub-
committees.

Lewis, Stephen Matrazzo and
Peter Muller were chosen as the
Tri-chairmen last year.

Subcommittees include pub-
lic relations, media, facilities,
speakers, finance, parade, plat-
form and the Journal, which is
the magazine program for the

convention.
State caucus chairmen will

also be named before the
spring, Lewis said. As well as

organizing state meetings and
parties, the state chairmen will
be largely responsible for the
research on which the nomina-
tion will be made.

Convention administrative
assistant Lee Feldman said that
the prediction will be made
from state newspapers, re-
search and political scientists’
opinions.

A budget based on the 1980
convention expenses which
totalled $64,000 has been set,

‘Lewis said. Funding will come

from several sources.

In addition to an Executive
Committee allocation, a Dallas
firm has donated twenty-five
$1,000 bonds as well as the in-
terest made on another donated
sum.

The school activity fee will
also be raised from $65 to $75.
Five dollars per student of this
tax increase will go to the mock
convention. Feldman explained

that the fee is raised every
mock convention year.

The convention schedule con-
sists of three convention ses-
sions and a traditional parade
down Lexington’s Main Street.

The parade will take place
Friday morning, Lewis said,
and will be followed by two ses-
sions Friday afternoon and Fri-
day night. The announcement of
the prediction will be made at
the Saturday session.

Lewis said contacts have
already begun in an effort to
find popular speakers for the
convention. He also said the
committee hoped to arrange.a
speaker for this spring.

Because of the convention’s
tradition of accuracy, the
media and public relations sub-
committees have begun prepar-
ations for a barrage of the
press.

‘We are trying to attract very
prominent national Democratic

figures who will attract the
media also,” Lewis explained.
He said the committee is ex-
pecting at least one major na-
tional television network (the
1980 convention was covered by
ABC), several major news-
papers and both wire services.

Lewis added that he is an-
ticipating a great deal of stu-
dent body support.

‘Ninety-nine percent of the
student body will be involved,”
he conjectured.

But, Lewis stressed that as
much support as can be had will
be needed.

“It’s a pretty serious under-
taking,” he said. “If anyone
feels that they can offer exper-
tise for the convention, we en-
courage them to come by.”’

“Right now,” added Feld-
man, “we are still in the
developmental stage.”

20/20

(continued from page 2)

Since August 1982, Mollenhoff
has written a series of articles
for the Washington Times, ad-
vocating the case of George
Spanton, 62, a whistle blower in
the Defense Contract Audit
Agency. ‘

Spanton is the DCAA branch
chief in West Palm Springs,
Fla., and a key witness in a
Justice Department investiga-
tion of allegations of fraudulent
expenditures by Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft executives.

But Spanton’s superiors in the

- DCAA regional office in Atlan-
ta, Ga., have been trying to
force him into early retirement
in a bureaucratic effort to sup-
press his charges of fraud in
Pratt and Whitney finances.

‘*At first, Mollenhoff had me
pouring over General Account-
ing Office reports and other
documents in the library to see
if we could find anything that
could shed some light on the
Spanton thing,”’ Elam said.

As their investigation carved
wider and wider circles of im-
plication, Elam focused on the
$67,500 Pratt and Whitney Con-
tribution to the Oklahoma Art
Center. By early February, he
was headed for Oklahoma City
to work with 20/20 producer
Charlie Thompson on the film-
ing of tonight’s show.

“The way an investigative
piece for television works is, the
producers go out and document
more than they need to prove

- the answers to their questions,”’

Elam said.

Generally, ‘‘what you start
with is information from a
source that you cannot possibly
use in any way,’’ Mollenhoff
said Tuesday. ‘“‘With regard to
the Art Center, Elam did most
of the advance documentation.”’

“Of course it was under my
direction,’”’ Mollenhoff said,

‘but he didn’t need much direc-
tion.”’ :

“Twenty/twenty and Mollen-
hoff are coordinating the in-
vestigation, sharing informa-
tion, keeping each other up to
date,” said Elam, whose impor-
tant contribution to the 20/20
segment was in corroborating
Mollenhoff’s information before.
the ABC News team went to
Oklahoma.

‘“‘While we were down there,
we spent a lot of time looking at
file tape for pictures to use on
the air,’ Elam said. “It’s a
back-up technique in case the
people you are trying to inter-
view won’t go on camera.

‘We did all the~ pre-
interviews, just to talk to them
to ask if they would go on
camera, then you bring in the
reporter, which in this case is
Geraldo Rivera.

“He is really an impressive

man, he has got a lot of.

presence, poise and tact.

“‘We briefed him at dinner the
night before and then at break-
fast before we went out.

‘‘He has a very keen mind, he
is able to pick up things , make
connections in things which are
presented to him very quickly,
which is a skill that allows him
to handle four investigations at
once.

‘Geraldo was able to ask the
right questions,’ Elam said.

During the pre-interview with
Edwards, the general said he
did not know the Pratt and
Whitney art donation was
charged to a government
financed account. ‘‘And that le
did not think that that was a
problem,’’ Eiam recounted.

‘“‘He said that he would be
willing to say.so on camera, but
that he didn’t see how that
would help us with our in-
vestigation.

‘We agreed to meet Edwards
again in a week, enough time
for him to conduct his own in-

would do.

‘‘We came back a week later,
when he said he would be free,
but he was unavailable.

‘‘His secretary told us he was

for an energy center at the

Elam telephoned the sym-
posium, which was being held
at the University stadium, and
requested a schedule of speak-
ers. The 20/20 team planned to
interview Edwards. during a
break between speakers.

‘“‘T went in ahead of Geraldo

ty director,” Elam said. “‘I in-

Lennon awarded Rikkyo

exchange scholarship

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity junior Sean Lennon of
Newark, Ohio, has become the
first W&L student to win a full
scholarship for study at Japan’s
Rikkyo University.

A physics and mathematics
major at W&L, Lennon will
enroll at Rikkyo in April and
will spend 10 months at the
Tokyoschool.

Washington and Lee has had
an exchange program with Rik-
kyo, one of Japan’s top-ranking
private institutions, since 1977.
This year W&L senior Robert
Crawford is in residence at Rik-
kyo while one Rikkyo student,
Akiko Nishi, is enrolled at
Washington and Lee under the
exchange program.

W&L is one of four American
institutions with which Rikkyo
has an exchange agreement.
The others are the University of
Chicago, the University of the
South, and Kenyon College.

“Although we have had
several students take advan-
tage of the program and study
at Rikkyo, Sean is the first of
our students to be awarded a
scholarship. for an_ entire
academic year. This represents
quite an impressive ac-
complishment for Sean,” said
Minor L. Rogers, associate pro-

fessor of religion at W&L and °

director of the university’s East
Asian Studies Program.

During his year at Rikkyo,
Lennon will continue to take
courses in his major fields of
study. He will also pursue
Studies in Japanese language,

Japanology, and Japanese
history.

“In addition to studying the
Japanese culture in the best
possible way —that is, by living
in Japan — I am anxious to
learn the different methods of
teaching and of viewing scien-
tific and practical problems,”
said Lennon, who is completing
his third year of Japanese
language study at W&L.

Lennon will live with a
Japanese family while at Rik-
kyo. :

At W&L, Lennon has worked
as student manager of Evans
Dining Hall. He has also served
as business manager of the
W&L Fencing Club.

A graduate of Newark Senior
High School, he is the son of
Mrs. James J. Lennon and the
late Mr. Lennon.

Rikkyo University was found-
ed in 1874 by a missionary of the
Anglican Episcopal Church.
The university has five col-
leges, each with a graduate
division, and seven research in-
stitutions. The teaching faculty
numbers approximately 700
while the university has more
than 12,000 undergraduate and
graduate students enrolled.

Tea & Sympathy opens March 21

Though set in the 1950s, the
themes of Robert Anderson’s
play “Tea and Sympathy”’ are
as relevant today as they were
when the play opened on Broad-
way in September, 1953.

That, at least, is the opinion of
Washington and Lee University
drama instructor Paula Lang-
don, who is directing the
University Theatre’s upcoming
production of ‘Tea and Sym-
pathy.”

“The play has a lot to do with
being different or, at least, be-
ing branded by one’s peers as
different and the isolation that
this difference causes,” says
Langdon. ‘‘I think the theme is
still relevant because of the way
each person within his or her
own environment struggles for
acceptance.

“T’ would hope that when the
play is over the audience would
have to make some decisions
about prejudice, about the
tendency of labeling people as
different and then rejecting,
maybe even persecuting, those
people.”’

“Tea and Sympathy,’ the
third production by the Univer-
sity Theatre this academic
year, will open March 21 1n the
Troubadour Theatre on the cor-
ner of Henry and Main Streets
in Lexington. It runs through
March 26 with curtain at 8 p.m.
each evening.

Tickets are $3. Reservations
are required and can be made
by telephoning the box office at
463-9111, Ext. 371, or 463-9395
from 10a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays
beginning March 9. (Members
of the W&L community are ad-
mitted without charge).

The play is set in an all-male
prep school in New England and
centers on the relationship one
of the students, Tom. (played by
W&L junior Larry Butler), has
with his fellow students and
with the housemaster (played

. by> W&L junior Christopher

Cartmill) and his wife (played
by W&L library assistant
Priscilla Lewis).

“T chose to do ‘Tea and Sym-
pathy’ for several reasons,”
noted Langdon, who teaches

acting at Washington and Lee.
“For one thing, it is a realistic
drama. Many of the plays that
we have done in the past two
years have been ‘presenta-
tional.’ In contrast, this play is
performed in a boxed set with
an imaginary wall between the
actors and the audience.

‘The students are continually
interested in doing plays from
this genre.”’

Too, the characters in the
play are more nearly the ages
of the W&L students who will
portray them.

“In recent productions many
of the students were playing
roles that were a lot older than
they will ever be cast in once
they leave here, For some of the
actors, the style of this play
—that is, the realism — has
been more difficult than some
of the character acting that
they have done in the past.”

The University Theatre pro-
duction of ‘‘Tea and Sympathy”
will be set in the year 1954.

Domino’s Pizza is located on the corner of Jefferson and elson Streets.

New Pizza in town

Domino’s delivers

Domino’s Pizza, the newest
food game in town, caters to the
lethargic .feet and ravenous
mouths of college students.

Promising ‘‘fast, free
delivery,’ the Lexington
Domino’s franchise opened on
February 5, under the direction
of manager John Forster. The
“out-pizza” operation is one of
about 800 branches serving 49
states.

“Business is going very
well,” said assistant Manager
Dan Hix, ‘‘maybe a little better
than we had expected.’’ Domi-
no’s serves well over 100 pizzas
on an average weeknight, said
Hix,

‘“‘Some people say this place

_ looks like a refrigerator,” Hix
noted; referring to the gleam-
ing, stark white interior of
Domino’s Pizza; but the cor-

porate hygiene policy is no less
stringent than the ‘‘hot in 30

minutes” guarantee.

Domino’s prepares 12-inch
and 16-inch pizzas, and offers 11
different toppings. The basic
medium-size cheese pizza costs
$4.40, and the 16-inch pie sells
for $6.45. Each topping for a
large pizza costs $1.30, and ex-
tra ingredients for the 12-inch
discs cost 90 cents.

The “Domino Deluxe’’ in-
cludes pepperoni, mushrooms,
onions, green peppers and
sausage. The ‘‘Deluxe’’ is pric-
ed at $8.05 for a medium, and
$11.70 for the larger pizza. The
“Price Destroyer’’ is laden with
nine toppings, and is yours to
eat for $9.40 (medium) or $13.60
(large). Sixteen-ounce cups of
Pepsi are available for 25 cents
apiece.

None of the Domino’s ingre-
dients are frozen. Their fresh

 

dough, sauce and toppings are
delivered twice weekly from the
district commissary in Raleigh,
N.C. Pizzas are cooked in elec-
tric ovens by infa-red, radiant
heat.

The product is then delivered
by car to addresses within a
two-mile radius of the ovens at
25 S. Jefferson St. Delivery cars
are equipped with sterno heat-
ing units, and the pizzas are
quaranteed to be hot in the
customer’s hand within 30
minutes of the telephone order
(463-7375. Drivers work for a
commission and tips, and may
accept cash or checks.

Domino’s opens at 11 a.m.
daily, and closes at 1 a.m., ex-
cept on Fridays and Saturdays,
when the lines are kept open un-
til2a.m.

 

EC

(continued from page 1)

Senior representative John
Viahoplus argued that helping
decorate the gym was not in his
‘job description,” and Ted Mc-
Quiston, Darby Brower and
Dave Jonson all said they were
not informed that help was
needed.

Nevertheless, Howard prais-
ed several SAB members, par-
ticularly Burford Smith, for
their work in preparing for the
ball. However, he said he felt
the committee was too large,
and some members either were
not able to help or just chose not
to help. As a result, six SAB
members did not receive free
tickets.

 

Marty Bechtold, public rela-
tions director for the 1984 Mock
Democratic Convention, asked
the EC to ensure that no one
other than the Mock Convention
sold Convention memorabilia in
the dining hall, Supply store,
student center and the Warner
Center.

The motion to do so passed
82, with both senior reps,
Valhoplus and Pete Baumgaert-
ner, voting against.

Reporting also for the Univer-
sity Athletic Committee, Bech-
told said that in a meeting,
University president John
Wilson had emphasized ‘‘how
much he liked the W&L philoso-

phy and that he wanted to stick
with it.”’ Bechtold also said the
committee was looking into the
possibility of having some out-
door basketball courts con-
structed although ‘the way the
school puts athletics on the
back-burner, I don’t think that’s
going to occur,’’ he said.

Lee Feldman complained of a
shortage of meeting rooms and
storage space in the student
center for clubs and _ other
organizations. Because of the
Mock Convention, both the
Calyx and Superdance have
been quartered in inadequate
offices. Griffith was named to a
one-man committee to look into
the problem.

  

Review:

Justice in ‘Verdict’

By ALLEN ROBERTS
Phi News Editor

He reached for the double-
shot glass, and it wobbled slow-
ly from the table’s surface. His
hands were only steady enough
to circle the Boston Globe
obituaries; not firmed to the
task of bringing a filled glass to
his lips. He set it down and cran-
ed his neck to slurp the top
ounce of scotch. Then he quick-
ly threw back the remaining
booze. :

This is Frank Galvin, a
liquor-sodden lawyer driven
from a comfortable law prac-
tice and marriage by devious
partners. This is one of many
taut scenes in the Verdict, one
of many stark moments when
Paul Newman infects the au-
dience with Galvin’s classic en-
trapment anxieties.

Newman plays an ‘“ambu-
lance-chaser”’ who is handed a
malpractice case against two
prominent doctors. At a
hospital run by the potent Ar-
chdiocese of Boston, the doctors
gave a pregnant woman the
wrong anesthetic before her
child was to be delivered. She
regurgitated in her air mask,
and while drowning in her own
vomit, fell into a vegetative
coma.

The Archdiocese, the doctors
and the couple who have cared
for the comatose young woman
for four years ... all want to
reach a settlement out of court.
Galvin needs his ‘standard 33
percent cut of the settlement.
But more than this, he finds, he
needs purpose, or perhaps faith.

The Verdict portrays one
man’s decision whether to
recover his trust in the common
man or to take the easy money
and drink his way back into
numbness. Galvin is a man who
has met ‘the enemy — the
judiciary system and the men it
regulates. He has met them and
joined the lowest of their ranks.
Should he try the case? He will
surely lose. Should he sur-
render?

The odds are stacked against
Galvin in almost comic dispro-
portion. At one point, an elusive
witness tells Galvin, ‘‘You’re all
the same... you’re all whores.”’
She then slams the door in the
lawyer’s face.

This and other incidents are
more than obstacles to Galvin’s
development of the case. These

are shufflings of the curtains
that he slowly opens, painfully,
to find at the movie’s climax... a

-mirror. The case provides a

reflection of Galvin’s
deteriorated motives, which
develops as a Polaroid photo-
graph before his eyes.

For all of Newman’s screen
sensibility, for all the delicate
emotions he evokes with his
eyes, his hands; Sidney
Lumet’s direction saturates the
poignant scenes with despairing
shadows. Lumet’s intentions
sometimes do come off in ex-
quisite editing cuts or under
masterful lighting. But finally
his efforts drown the viewer in
shades of grey. There is too
much darkness, too many si-
lent, skewed shots of Galvin’s
inner struggle.

This well-meaning overkill
does not, however, doom the
film.

Galvin’s development is com-
plimented by his terse,
enigmatic lover, played by
Charlotte Rampling. She is at
once devious and vulnerable,
cool and unsure.

Jack Warden gives an earnest
and palpable performance as
Galvin’s mentor, who has lost
his patience with an able but ir-
responsible peer.

Galvin’s friend describes the
lawyer for the defense as ‘‘the
f---ing Prince of Darkness.’’ In-
deed, this character, played by
James Mason, is stolid and
merciless in his lavish office.
Surrounded by innumerable
conniving cronies, Mason’s
visage is only broken once, and
then he shows it shatteringly.

Lindsay Crouse and Milo
O’Shea are convincing as a
working-class Irish couple vic-
timized by professional _ir-
responsibility. Their helpless-
ness is real for the audience.

The Verdict, like so many
great movie ideas, did not
materialize in a slick produc-
tion. It is distinguished,
however, by the problems it ad-
dresses, and Lumet’s influence
is enhanced by magnetic per-
formances.

The film is special because it
is not mute. It says something
to the listener. The message
comes from a new angle — the
view of man as a cell in the vast,
complex organism our society
calls Justice.

 

Sympathy

have had is finding a realistic
foundation,’’ notes Langdon.
“For that, the actors have done
a good deal of research into the
1950s. They must know, for in-
stance, the character of the
country then. They must know
about the government, about
the social climate. They need to
feel completely acclimated to
that earlier time. It is all part of
the educational process, and
they have enjoyed it.”’

The action in ‘“‘Tea and Sym-
pathy”’ takes place in the house
where eight of the prep school
students live with the house-
master and his wife.

The set for the show was
designed by W&L senior Skip
Epperson and is done in several
tiers to indicate the various
rooms in the boarding house.

Along with the set, Langdon
hopes that the cast will create
the desired effect of constant
activity within the house.

W&L escapes 12-10; face Midshipmen Saturday

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team survived a four-
goal surge late in the fourth
quarter by the Chesapeake Club
to win Sunday’s exhibition on
Wilson Field, 12-10.

Jeff Mason’s second goal of
the game gave W&L its biggest
lead, 11-6, with 12:47 left.
Chesapeake then reeled off four
unanswered scores to draw
within 11-10 at 2:59. W&L
graduates Geoff Brent and
George Santos contributed
goals in the Chesapeake rally.

Chesapeake, which had lost
10-7 to highly regarded Virgin-
ia the previous afternoon,
had a chance to tie when they
called a time-out in the
Generals’ end with 51 seconds to
go. W&L middie Chris John
snuffed out the club’s hopes,
however, by picking up a loose
ball along the far sideline and
sprinting almost the length of
the field for the clincher at :17.
For John, who has been a leader
of the defensive midfielder
group, it was his first goal of the
year.

Sandy Brown paced a W&L
attack that operated without
senior Geoff Wood, who had
notched four goals against
Duke. Two of Brown’s three
tallies came in the opening
minutes of both halves. Joe
Seifert (2 goals, 3 assists) and
Lee Heimert (2 goals, 2 assists)
also helped send Chesapeake to
its second loss in three outings.

fort against Chesapeake to the

“We looked a little better offen-
sively, but we’re still not clear-

end) as well as we can. We’ve
got to improve on holding on to
the ball. We’re getting there,
though.”

bers from all four classes.
Senior tri-captain Alan Ar-

Last year W&L beat Roches-

points out that this year Roches-
ter should prove to be a for-
midable opponent. ‘‘Last year,
we played exceptionally well,
but they are returning nearly
all of their starters.” Roanoke
and Lynchburg, who edged out
the Generals in last year’s
ODAC tournament, should once
again field strong teams this
year. The Generals will get
their first look at these squads
at the ODAC Championships,
which will be hosted by W&L on
April 25-26.

Summing up the coming
season, Leslie states, ‘‘I’m look-
ing forward to working with the
newcomers to the team, but I
don’t know what to expect. A
lack of experience is our biggest
problem, but I think we’ll come
along if we work hard.”’

In addition, he has been able to

that does not offer athletic
scholarships.

Emmer, a_ 37-year-old
graduate of Rutgers, does not
like to dwell on the difficulty in
recruiting created by not being
able to give even the very best
high school players a purely
athletic scholarship. ‘We’ve
always been able to operate
without scholarships,’’ he

and have competed on a near-
equal basis with the bigger
schools. In fact, W&L’s record
has been 103-40 over the last ten
years and has qualified for the
NCAA tournament seven times.

With the program’s less than
prosperous beginnings, there
should be an explanation for the
successful turnaround. One
need not look further than the
man who has overseen the pro-
gram since 1973, coach Jack
Emmer.

While Emmer feels that the
lifestyle of Lexington and the
strength of the academic pro-
gram at W&L make his job an
ideal situation, it is the school
that should consider itself for-
tunate to have someone ack-

Emmer points to the support

the students’ favorite, a rite of

come to a school where he
might get some financial
assistance, if he’s really smart
or his family is ‘really poor,
while the competition can give
him a full scholarship. In recent
years more and more rivals
have gone to the maximum
number of athletic grants allow-
ed for NCAA Division I lacrosse
(14).

At the same time, W&L has
had to eliminate some of its
financial aid due to the federal
cutback in funds.

But, said Emmer, as long as
the program can perpetuate
itself at its accustomed rate, it
will stay in Division I.

“We were 9-4 last year,’” he
said. ‘“‘Two of those losses were
to UNC and UVa and nobody’s
been able to keep up with them
except Johns Hopkins. Our
other two losses were by one
goal. That’s being very com-
petitive.’’

There is one thing Emmer
said he would like to see altered
at W&L, a change he said would
help the program without
changing the school’s admis-
sion policy.

Said Emmer, ‘‘The school has
drawn a very distinct line, by
which those (members of an in-
coming freshman class) in the
lowest academic quarter of the
incoming class rarely get con-
sidered for financial aid. If we
considered the potential of the
lowest quarter to make more of
a contribution to the university
than some of the brighter
students, I think we could be
able to get some of the players
we haven’t in the past. We could
do that and it-wouldn’t lower
our admission standards.”’

THIS IS A HELL OF A WAY

.. slowly but surely, we’ve
finally approached NCAA tour-
nament time and the question of
who will get and who deserves
bids from the committee makes
its annual appearance. With the
tournament expanded — once
again — to now include 52
teams, the question is: who’s
not going to get a bid? Let’s face

it: either they make the tourna-
ment smaller and more selec-
tive (say, back to the original
32), or they send a bid to every
Division I team (which has been

‘proposed by the coaches’ asso-

ciation). When it comes right
down to it, are there really 52 or
32 teams that deserve a chance
for the national championship?

Given the nature of athletic con-

tests where on any given day -

any team can beat another
team, the idea of a 32-or 52-team
tournament is as fair as a 274-
team tournament. I don’t think
you can get a true national
champion that way. There are
maybe eight teams that are of
national championship calibre.

It may be difficult to narrow
yourself to eight selections but
if you can do this the resulting
winner will be the true national
champion.... But I guess there’d
be no hype, then, no mega-
bucks for the NCAA. Poor guys.
Send your dollars to CARE,

tee, Shawnee Mission, Kansas.
Thank you...

...Well, back to the collonade
and Wilson Field. There’s some-
thing about the lacrosse team

SR CTT
WE xINTOR VA 463-3424

Did you miss because of Fancy Dress?

this year that has to make
Coach Jack Emmer feel good,
at least if the first two contests
can be taken as an indication of
the team’s character. In both
instances, the Generals ex-
hibited the ability to know how
to win. W&L was able to bend,
but instead of breaking, they
had the composure to regain
command. It’s a_ promising
start...

...Looks like Herschel Walker
made the right decision after
all. Impressive stats for Mr.
Walker in Game One of his pro-
fessional career: 16 carries for
a staggering 60 yards. Take the
money and run, right Herschel?
Oh well, the dollar is rather in-
flated anyway...

... The United States’ failure
in its Davis Cup tie last week-
end against Argentina can be
attributed to one man — who
didn’t even set foot on the red
clay of Buenos Aires. The man
is Jimmy Connors. Connors,
No. 1 in the world for 1982 and
an established clay court
player, continued his strange
refusal to play Davis Cup ten-
nis, a decision which has hurt
U.S. chances in the past and this
time killed them. It’s a shame
the new Jimmy Connors is still
the same old immature brat
when it comes to situations like
these...

One closing note. If Oklaho-
ma’s freshman phenom
Wayman Tisdale stays in col-
lege all four years, he will end
up making Pete Maravich and
Ralph Sampson look like high
school flashes. Watch him...
