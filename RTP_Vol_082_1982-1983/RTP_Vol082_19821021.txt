Powell speaks
at Law School

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Supreme Court Justice Lewis
F. Powell Jr., speaking Monday
at the Washington and Lee Law
School, denied recent reports of
dissension among the justices
and acknowledged that the
Court is facing a considerable
overload of cases.

Associate Justice Powell, a
graduate of both W&L and the
W&L Law School, addressed a
standing-room-only crowd of
law students in the Moot Court-

~ room of Lewis Hall. In the mor-

ning, he met with a law class
and in the afternoon gave a
short address and then took a
broad range of questions from
the students. Before he began
the question-and-answer ses-
sion, he told the students he’d
feel free to ‘‘take the fifth”’ if he
felt it necessary.

Responding to press accounts
of discord among the members
of the Court, Powell said that
although there is friction, no
deep rift exists. Some ot the
reports, he said, gave the im-

pression that they were
“feuding and fighting with each
other all the time.”’

Some difference of opinion, he
says, is inevitable. “Some of

these cases,’ he told the
students, “‘generate very strong
feelings.” In an_ interview

following his speech, he added,
“There is disagreement, of
course, and that’s proper. The

system ought to work that
way.”

He put it into perspective for
the students by saying, ‘‘We are
nine lawyers, and it’s hard to
get two layers to agree on
anything, let alone nine.”’
They’re all friends, though,
“despite what the media says.”

Powell joined the Court in
1971 as the only Nixon-
appointed Democrat on the high
bench. At the time, he said, he
was afraid that ‘“‘the brothers
were not always friendly.’’
Those fears have been allayed,
though. There is ‘‘no lack of
civility,” he said.

This civility extends to the
most recent appointee, Sandra
Day O’Connor. Although he
“had never heard of her before
she was nominated,” Powell
said she was an “‘ideal’’ and
“outstandingly able choice.”’
Powell pointed out to the
amusement of the audience
that, as the junior justice, the
duties of doorkeeper and cof-
feemaker for private sessions
fall to her.

‘“‘She’s another very
stimulating colleague,”’ he add-
ed.

A recurring problem for the
Court is its overcrowded docket
and backlog of cases. Indeed,
last year the Court filled its
docket only three months into
the term, prompting Chief

IFC promises $7,500 for Contact

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

By a margin of 14 to 2, the In-
terfraternity Council voted
Tuesday night to offer Contact
$7,500, as it had last year.

Although Contact Co-
chairman Mike Skardon had re-
quested $8,500 before the vote
was taken, after the meeting co-
chairman Mike Drinkwater
said he was appreciative.

Contact is a program started
by the IFC, which brings
speakers to W&L.

Treasurer Emery Ellanger
pointed out that several houses
were already behind in their
monthly dues,” and that it
would not be possible to raise
the pledge to over $7,500.

President Mason Ellerbe said
that the IFC reserve fund was
empty.

Mooney and Mason Ellerbe. (Phi photo by David Sprunt)

$7,500 is $1000 more than they
were expecting to get,
anyway,’’ remarked Delta Tau
Delta President Tony Zaccagni-
ni.

The meeting also focused on
how the program would be
financed in the future.

Skardon told the IFC that he
believes the university will be

 

willing to contribute in the
future. But an administrator
told Skardon that ‘‘because the
school operates like a corpora-
tion,’ Contact could not be
figured into the budget for fund-
ing before the end of this year.

Ellerbe requested that in the
spring, Contact representatives

should come to the IFC instead
of the Executive Committee
when they want to discuss
future financial support from
the IFC.
Correction

In the Oct. 7 Ring-tum Phi, it
was reported that Sigma Chi
was placed on Social Probation
by the IFC. Omitted from the
story were the facts that:

---Kappa Alpha was also fined
$150 and given two weeks proba-
tion for having a band on a
weeknight, and

--Phi Gamma Delta was
given a total of five weeks social
probation for having a band on
a weeknight, and for a distur-
bance at the Sigma Phi Epsilon
house last spring which resulted
in two car windows being bro-
ken with a beer keg and a third
car being damaged.

Tuition
up 1.4%

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer

Tuition at Washington and
Lee will go up by 7.4 percent .
next year.

The Board of Trustees voted
to raise the tuition fee from
$5,400 to 5,800 during its fall
meeting held in Philadelphia
last week.

Although no official an-
nouncement by the Board has
been made concerning the tui-
tion increase, the increase was
confirmed by university ad-
ministrators.

In addition to the tuition in-
crease, several other university
fees were raised.

The cost of a meal plan for
one year in Evans Dining Hall
was increased by 6.7 percent
from $1,500 to $1,600. The
average room rental fee was in-
creased by seven percent from
$1,046 to $1,119. The Board also
authorized an increase in the
student activities fee of about
11.5 percent, raising the ‘‘stu-
dent tax”’ to $70 from $60.

Altogether this is an increase
of more than seven percent in
university charges for tuition,
rooms, food and student ac-
tivities, with the total rising to
$8,589 from $8,006 this year.

This year’s increase follows
last year’s jump of 12.5 percent.
Tuition in 1981-82 was $4,800,
and rose to $5,400 for 1982-83.

The Board discussed increas-
ing financial aid for students to
offset the increase in tuition. An
increase in aid would balance
against the increase in tuition to
determine students’ share in
paying the cost of education at
W&L.

Alumni gifts, endowments
and other sources pay for the
majority of educational costs
which are not covered by tuition
and student fees.

A recently announced tuition
increase at the University of
Virginia for next year will not
be offset by a comparable in-
crease in student financial aid,
according to Monday’s Roanoke
Times. The result will be an in-
crease in the student’s share of
the total educational cost
burden from 30 percent in
1981-82 to 39 percent next year.

The question of how the stu-
dents’ share in paying the cost
of an education at W&L will
change as a result of the tuition
increase remains open pending
official word from the universi-
ty concerning the Board’s ac-
tions on financial aid.

Opinion

 

 

We can turn around

alcohol grudge-match

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor in Chief

“Pavilion parties as we know them are dead.”

So says someone privy to a meeting of university administrators
and Lexington officials in the wake of the raid on Chi Psi’s pavilion
party, at which 30 kegs were confiscated and six students were
charged with criminal offenses. The Alcoholic Beverage Commis-
sion ordered the raid because, it is charged, Chi Psi did not get the
necessary licenses for an open party, and did not take necessary
precautions to keep the party closed.

Commonwealth’s attorney John Read said at this meeting that he
was directing the local police to arrest anyone drinking in public,
starting immediately.

What???

Imagine the jail filling up this weekend with parents and women
from neighboring colleges as Read’s crusade unilaterally erases
minks’ bad habits and cleans up this collegiate hub of scum and
villainy.

Should we close ranks against this surprise attack?

If Read thinks he can make a dent in W&L’s drinking habits he is
mistaken. His efforts are puny. And worse, his efforts are counter-
productive.

He is calling a grudge-match. Now it is us against them. But why
must it be so? Why can’t we cooperate? His intentions are very
good, it seems. He wants to circumvent the party mentality that
people now connect with the recent deaths of students from VMI,
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College and the University of Virginia.
Don’t we all want that?

It’s not too late to call a halt to escalating grudges and to work out
differences with mutual respect. The burden is on the students of
W&L, and no one else. As one could see at a recent intercollegiate
conference in Lynchburg, there is no school around that trusts the
student body as much as W&L does. Roanoke College, for example,
has complete control of all fraternity social functions.

And so, the burden is on Bennett Ross, Morgan Griffith, and all
the Executive Committee. The burden is on Mason Ellerbe, Steve
Jones and every IFC member. The burden is on this newspaper and
every single student. We must regulate ourselves, and defend the
privilege to do so.

Letter: Don’t blame ABC

Editor:

This letter is in reply to a comment by Executive Committee
representative John Vlahoplus, made at the Oct. 11 meeting. As
reported by the Phi, Vlahoplus stated, in regards to the Chi Psi par-
ty, ‘“The police could come to almost any party and nuke us.”’ In ad-
dition, this letter addresses Viahoplus’s summation of the E.C.’s
stand on the issue: ‘‘It was inconsistent cases such as this and
others that prompted the E.C.’s vote of confidence for those involv-
ed with the (Chi Psi) party raided Friday.”

Regardless of whether Chi Psi is innocent or guilty of the
charges, it is narrow-minded to state that they should not have been
arrested because the party the week before was allowed to go on.
Comparing Chi Psi’s party to the sophomore party is similar to
comparing a murder suspect to an unsolved crime. Just because
there are no suspects in the latter case, does this justify releasing
the murder suspect without a trial? It does not. Possibly, the
sophomore party was in violation of the law, but the ABC officials
were busy elsewhere. The best form of law enforcement would be to
have a police officer on every corner, and in every house. This is
not feasible, by any stretch of the imagination. If Chi Psi is guilty of
the infraction(s), what is going to be Vlahoplus’s defense? I can see
it now: ‘‘Well, they (Chi Psi) should not be charged, because
previous parties have escaped the arm of the law.’’ I seriously
doubt this is the proper approach. The case should be analyzed
acoording to its own merits, not by another’s.

It is sad to realize that one of our senior class representatives,
and the whole EC body, is ignorant of the fact that the ABC officials
are trying to accomplish their task. Instead of condemning their ef-
forts, the EC should vote to support the law. This could possibly
help to avert tragic endings, such as the VMI accident several
weeks ago. I was there with the Rescue Squad, and it is easy enough
to change the scenario to Route 251, or any road back from a W&L
party, and friendly faces from the Colonnade. The arrests of the six
individuals is a step in the right direction toward enforcement of
the alcoholic laws. Arrest or death can change one’s life, but action
by the ABC officials may have prevented recurrences that are un-
necessary.

Sincerely yours,
David W. Stevens Jr. ’83

FOCUS offers endless benefits

Editor:

For those students who don’t
know, the goal of FOCUS, The
Interdisciplinary Symposium,
is to encourage independent
thinking as a supplement to the
educational process.

| Se

Need a
loan? Bad?

Editor:

The Student Emergency Loan
Committee is administered by
students. Its loans are small
and interest-free, and for a
maximum of thirty days. Loans
are granted only in cases of

substantial personal financial .

hardship.

A student who wishes to apply
for a loan should contact a
member, and an_ informal
meeting will be arranged with
the applicant and the entire
committee, and the terms will
be set by the committee through
a promissory note.

Study |
in Japan

Editor :

Please print the following in
the next issue of the Ring-tum
Phi:

“Your attention is drawn to
Washington and Lee’s 1983
spring program in Japan. This
program was _ inadvertently
omitted from the flyers announ-
cing the university’s other
study abroad programs. In-
terested students should con-
tact Professor Minor Rogers in
Newcomb 32A by November 1.”’
S.J. Williams, Jr., Chairman
Foreign Study Committee

In other words, FOCUS wants
to be a clearing house for the
theories of standouts. In so do-
ing, we, the FOCUS Committee,
hope to spark controversy,
debate and enliven the intellec-
tual climate on campus.

In pursuance of this goal,

FOCUS publishes a journal of
interdisciplinary thought entitl-
ed Excelsior. In this journal, we
ask, even beg, for the theories
and ideas of students on any
topic. It is this interdisciplinary
approach which distinguishes
us from other university
publications such as Ariel or the
W&L Polical Review.
_ In addition, FOCUS hopes to
present a quadrennial sym-
posium on a topic of an inter-
disciplinary nature. The lec-
tures, debates, seminars and
papers presented therein would
be a kind of living clearing
house for the theories of
students, as opposed to the
printed clearing house we offer
in the Excelsior.

This is, of course, a capsuliz-

ed version of what FOCUS is.
There is much more to be said
about the endless benefits this
group can offer to students and
the university as a whole. Any
freshman, sophomore or junior
who would like to know more
about how joining this commit-
tee can benefit them are en-
couraged to call Chris Bouquet
at 463-9524 or Bill Archer at
463-9708. We also ask students to
be attentive to our posters on
campus — about times of
meetings and deadlines for Ex-
celsior. As we have only seniors
on the committee this year, our
primary goal is recruitment.
We will publish the Excelsior
this year and hope to put on a
mini-symposium, as a taste of
what could be in 1986. This com-
mittee was officially labeled a
“good idea’ by the University
Council in 1981. We are asking
for the interest and support of
the W&L community so that this
good idea will bear fruition.

Aleohol Awareness
to educate students

Governor Robb will soon an-
nounce Nov. 1-7 as ‘‘Alcohol
Awareness Week”’ for the state
of Virginia. College campuses
across the state, including
W&L, the University of
Virginia, Sweet Briar College
and Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College, among others, will
observe the week with various
programs designed to make
students more knowledgeable
about drinking.

Some Virginia campuses,
other than those noted above,
have recently experienced in-
creasing restrictions on the use
and advertisement of alcohol in
attempts to regulate student
social life.

“That’s not the route at
W&L,”” Dean of Freshman
Robert Huntley said. ‘‘Nobody’s

sending Elliott Ness around to -

shoot holes in the fraternities
beer barrels on Wednesday
night or anything like that.”
The student Executive Com-
mittee leads off the week’s ac-
tivities with a demonstration of
the university’s new ‘‘Breath-
alyzer,’’ the gift of alumnus An-
drew Bauer. The controlled

test, beginning at approximate-
ly 4 p.m. Monday, with reflex
testing beginning in early even-
ing, will include W&L students,
VMI Cadets and, according to
plans, a W&L faculty member
and a W&L administrator.

Other activities during the
week will include demonstra-
tions of home-brewing, with
tasting privileges and recipes
available, a non-alcoholic
drinks demonstration and a
contest in which students at-
tempt to identify various
brands of beer.

One evening will feature an
alcohol quiz program - (the
‘Punch Bowl’’) pitting the Col-
lege Republicans against the
Young Democrats, with the
winner representing W&L at the
state playoffs at the University
of Virginia next spring.

The emphasis of the entire
week will be on education or, as
Huntley noted, ‘‘How to be hap-
py tonight — and tomorrow
too!”’

Next week’s Phi will carry
the complete schedule of the en-
tire week’s program.

 

 

chapel tomorrow

percussion quartet performing
Philip Faini’s ‘‘Bravura’’;
“Fanfare” by Paul Dukas;
‘“Spectrums”’ by Paul Shahan;
“Tower Music’ by Karol
Rathaus; and, ‘‘Stop! The Red
Light’s On,”’ a big band swing
number from the library of
Gene Krupa.

The 51-member W&L Glee
Club, directed by Gordon P.
Spice, will perform Baroque
double chorus music by Jacob
Handl; portions of a mass by
Schubert accompanied by brass
quartet and timpani; and, a

Slovak folk chorus by Dvorak,
featuring four-hand piano ac-

companiment. In addition, the
Glee Club’s' small chorus,
Southern Comfort, will present

special selections, including
spirituals and sea chanteys.

By tradition, the concert will
conclude with the W&L Glee
Club’s version of the ‘“W&L
Swing.”

The Parents’ Weekend Con-

cert will be the first of the
season for both the Brass and

Percussion Ensemble and the
W&L Glee Club.

The Ensemble’s future
engagements include a perfor-
mance by the Quintet on Oc-
tober 31 at the Lutheran Church
of the Good Shepherd in Lex-
ington, a January concert tour
in the Washington, D.C., area,
and the annual winter tour to
Florida in February.

designed as a residence for both
foreign and American students
at W&L and is also closely
aligned with the activities of the
university’s International Club.

“Our long-range goal is to
create ‘a truly international
community,” explained Seng
Kah (Henry) Baey, a W&L
senior from the Republic of
Singapore.

Baey has been a guiding force
behind the International House
concept, first approaching the
university administration with
the idea two years ago.

“Professor (Minor) Rogers
(associate professor of religion)
had mentioned the idea of an In-
ternational House,” said Baey.
“The idea struck me as one that
could be extremely good for us
totry.”

Baey is one of five W&L
students — two of whom are
from foreign countries — who
are residing at the International
House this year.

“T think it is particularly im-
portant to emphasize that the
idea is not to segregate foreign
students from the rest of the
university community. It is

quite the opposite,”’ said Baey.
“The foreign students who have
come to Washington and Lee,
many of them as part of ex-
change programs, are most in-
terested in becoming active in
all phases of the university’s
life.”’

But Baey hopes that the Inter-
national House will eventually
become a place where students,
faculty and members of the
Lexington community will
gather to learn about and dis-
cuss different cultures.

‘“‘We had been hopeful that we
could arrange a building that
would accomodate about a
dozen or so residents instead of
the five we have this year,”
Baey said. “But that may be
possible in the future.

“Even so, the International
House will provide a location
for the members of the Interna-

* tional Club to meet informally

and to hold our gatherings.

“The presence of Interna-
tional House ought to be a
positive force for the club. Our
goal in the International Club is
to provide educational pro-
grams that help promote better
understanding of foreign cul-
tures. These will take a variety
of forms, from social gather-
ings to speaker forums.”

Among the programs that the
International Club at W&L is
planning is a series of special
international nights that will be
devoted to a particular part of

 

the Placement Office.

the world.

“‘We have talked of having a
European night and an Asian
night at the International
House,”’ said Baey. ‘“‘We would
have food from that area of the
world and discussions or
demonstrations representing
some aspect of the culture.

“We also plan to create a
speakers’ bureau through
which the exchange and foreign
students at W&L would make
themselves available to area
schools and civic groups to
discuss their respective coun-
tries and cultures. We have
already had a talk featuring a
foreign diplomat. We will also
bring some cultural groups to
the campus and will have our
second International Day.”’

H. Robert Huntley, associate
dean of students at Washington
and Lee and adviser to the In-
ternational Club, said the
establishment of International
House represents an important
element in the university’s con-
tinuing efforts to create a
heterogeneity in the student

ly.

“I think one could argue that
the active recruitment and pre-
sence of foreign students at
Washington and Lee is a natural
extension of General Lee’s con-
cern that this be a place where
young men of different geogra-
phical backgrounds and
ideologies could study together
in harmony and unity,” said
Huntley. “If this made good
sense for the last half of the 19th
century, it makes at least as
much sense for the world of the
20th century.”’

Executive Committee approves budget

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

At its regular Monday night
meeting, the Executive Com-
mittee approved the 1982-83
budget. Unlike last year, there
was no discussion and the
amounts allocated last week re-
mained unchanged. President
Bennett Ross said that clubs
should get their money this
week.

Lee Feldman of the Student
Telephone Union came before
the Committee to discuss the
possibility of STU being incor-
porated. Feldman stated that
the disadvantages would in-
clude the chartering fees and
the fee which would be paid to
Thomas C. Spencer for drawing
up their incorporation papers.

The total cost would be approx-
imately $350. Written into the
charter would be a_ section
detailing the amount of money
to be returned to the EC.

Feldman referred to this as
the ‘‘Magic Formula.”’

Senior Rep. John Vlahoplus
was against letting STU deter-
mine the ‘magic formula.”
“It’s kind of like letting the wolf
decide how many sheep to give
back.”

‘‘Well, the EC would have
ultimate power to say ‘bye-bye
to STU. It would appoint the
directors and the president of
the EC would serve as STU
president but wouldn’t have a
vote,’’ Feldman responded.

Law Rep. Ken. Terwilleger
asked about the corporate in-

come tax and Feldman replied,
“Spencer said we could work it
out to where our income is zero
by paying the EC supervisory
fees.” Terwilleger commented
that it could probably be work-
ed out so that law students and
faculty could draw up the incor-
poration papers, saving the ex-
pense of Spencer.

Once again the problem of
White Book revisions was dis-
cussed. The discussion this
week revolved around when
revisions should be made, as op-
_ to what should be chang-

procedure of a public honor

Over 200 vote in Mock Election

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

“Stay the course,’’ seemed to
be the sentiment on campus last
Thursday as students voted in a
Mock Election sponsored by the
Washington and Lee Political
Review.
~ “T think the result reflects the
conservative climate at W&L,”
said Jim Falk, editor of the
Review and chairman of the
Mock Election. The Republi-
cans were big winners in both
the Senate and the sixth Con-
gressional district races. Paul
Trible score a 79 to 21 percen-
tage victory over Richard
Davis in the Senate contest, and
Kevin Miller beat Jim Olin by 74
percent to 26 percent in the
House vote. ‘

Falk says the turnout was
very good. ‘‘In the past, we’ve
had, at most, 100. This time, it
was 200-250, which was ex-
cellent.”

‘There is a real climate of
political support for all of the
candidates,’ he said. ‘‘That’s
why The Political Review spon-
sored it. It was unbiased — we
gave equal attention to all the
candidates. Both clubs — the
College Republicans and Young
Democrats — had their para-
phernalia out.’”’

Senate candidate Trible had
planned to appear the afternoon
of the Mock Election at a rally
sponsored by the College Re-
publicans. It was scheduled to
held in front of McCormick
Hall, and Mock Election results
were to be announced at that
time. However, Trible had a
last minute change in plans,
and flew back to his campaign
headquarters in Richmond.

There he hastily called a
press conference in which he at-
tacked Davis for ‘‘utter distor-
tions, half-truths and lies’
about Trible’s voting record in
the House, where he is the first
district representative.
Reporters present said Trible
was ‘‘visibly angry.”

Trible’s tirade was in re-

 
 

sponse to a statement of the
previous day, when Davis call-
ed Trible ‘‘a press release con-
gressman” and ridiculed his
foreign trips to ‘‘Switzerland,
Fiji, Italy and the Britsh West
Indies.”’

Although different polls yield
slightly varying results, both
races are considered at this
point to be tossups, and none of
the four candidates can claim
favorite or underdog status.

A statewide poll relased two
weeks ago by the Richmond
Times-Dispatch called the
Senate race ‘‘too close to call.”’
Of those surveyed, 34 percent
favored Trible, 30 percent sup-
ported Davis, and 35 percent
were undecided. When voters
who were undecided but leaning
toward a particular candidate
were added to the totals, Trible

had 38 percent and Davis gar-
nered 34 percent.

The poll had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percent
which means that Trible could
have been ahead by as much as
12 points, or that Davis could
have been ahead by up to 4
points.

A poll last week by the
Associated Press and WRC-TV
also showed Trible and Davis in
a dead heat. Davis had 41 per-
cent and Trible received 39 per-
cent, ‘‘a statistically insignifi-
cant margin in a pre-election
poll.”’ One in five of those polled
was still undecided, and neither
candidate had overwhelming
strength of support. Forty-nine
percent of Trible’s backers said
they were strong supporters,
compared to 54 percent of Davis
supporters.

remiss not to fix the problems,”
Viahoplus said.

Because there has been little
interest from the students, and
according to Junior Rep. Ted
McQuiston, ‘“‘that if the revi-
sions were done now people
might think we’re covering our
tracks,” the EC decided to
begin to make the necessary
revisions in January.

Barry Russell appeared be-
fore the EC to request that
something be done about the

conditions and use of the weight
room. Senior Rep. Pete Baum-
gaertner concurred, saying that
the equipment was becoming
unsafe. The Committee decided
to refer the matter to the
University Athletic Committee.

Baumgaertner announced
that the faculty EC has propos-
ed Saturday classes for the first

would allow students to take
Monday, Jan. 3, as part of the
Christmas Holiday.

Lexington. (Phi photo by David Sprunt)

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

In what is being described as
a “rebirth” by their regional
adviser, the Sigma Nu social
fraternity is trying to rise from
the ashes of last year’s demise.

Eight freshmen have been
recruited by the national
organization, which is based in
Lexington and was founded at
VMI, to reform the Lambda
chapter that disbanded last fall.

Freshman Chris John is
president of the group trying to
reform the fraternity. The new
Sigma Nus will attain a ‘‘post-
colony’ status some time
around Parents’ Weekend, he
said. ‘‘Post-colony” implies
that they are trying to form a
colony at a university where a
chapter has already existed.

John, son of Dean of Students
Lewis John, sees the reforma-
tion of the house as an oppor-
tunity ‘‘to be in on decisions...to
make it what we want to make
it. ” His goal for the house is to

“start from scratch” and put
the house “‘into the form that it
once was...one of the best.”’

Dan Rodriguez, who is
regional director for the na-
tional organization, sees the
reformation as “a challenge of
putting together something
now..(with) no traditions.”’ He
also called it an “opportunity
(for the members of the colony)
to do something on their own
from the first.’’

Both John and Rodriguez
noted that the new organization
has considerable support from
alumni of the chapter. The
alumni are currently conduc-

ting a fundraising drive for
money to refurbish the old
chapter house on Henry Street.

Work is expected to begin on
the house in January. The base-
ment and first floor are suppos-
ed to be completed in the
spring. Then, if all goes accor-
ding to plan, the chapter will
celebrate its 100th anniversary,
and the present ‘‘post-colony’’
will receive its charter. John
expects the fraternity to be able
to occupy the house next fall.

As for the people who had
been members of Sigma Nu
before it disbanded last fall,
Rodriguez said that Capt.
Charles Hill, their faculty ad-
viser, sent them all letters ask-
ing if they wanted to participate
in the reorganization of the
fraternity, but received no
responses. The letter stated
that the original members
should be willing to observe cer-
tain guidelines necessary to
make it a good chapter of Sigma
Nu.

Rodriguez pointed out that
the old members felt that these
guidelines were not necessary.
Although no agreement could
be reached Rodriguez said
there were no_ resultant
hostilities between the national
organization and the original
members.

Former Sigma Nu active Bill
France added, ‘‘Dan Rodriguez
and Mo Littlefield made the ef-
fort to get letters to everyone,”’
but that the former members of
the fraternity were not in-
terested in becoming involved
in the reestablishment of the

 

 

 

house.

OPEN 7 DAYS 6-12

 

Sigma Nu rises from ashes

Rodriguez added that all of
the local debt accumulated by
the original members had been
paid off by the chapter’s alum-
ni. According to John these
debts totaled close to $10,000.

With all of this behind them,
the members of the new Sigma
Nu are not holding their own
rush. They are being very selec-
tive in choosing freshmen who,
for whatever reason, did not
pledge any other house during
the original rush, John said.

John and the others in the
group are also busy writing a
constitution and by-laws for
their new fraternity.

Carole Chappell manages ‘wildlife

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi staff writer

The sign outside the office
said “Wildlife Manager,’’ but
the voice coming from inside
was not so dramatic.

Instead, a smooth southern
accent sighs into the phone
receiver: ‘‘University Center.
May I help you?” The call had
started a daily routine for
Carole Chappell.

As the minutes become hours,
a steady stream of students
enter, lingering to talk or just
loitering. Chappell seems to at-
tract students, and her office
has been a gathering place for
them in the five years she has
worked at Washington and Lee.

Many of the students are here
to see Michael A. Cappeto, asso-
ciate dean of students and
director of placement. Others
belong to organizations that
receive telephone messages
and mail here.

‘T’'m officially the career
secretary for Mike Cappeto, but
over the years, I’ve become a
secretary for the organiza-
tions,’’ Chappell said.

But more than that, she’s a
friend.

“‘T really love my job. I like to
think that’s because I am a dif-
ferent type of secretary. I enjoy
partying with the students. I
just love to talk with people,”
she said. “I guess I just enjoy
the all-male environment.”’

Being a woman in a man’s
school makes her a center of at-
tention, and a target for tom-
foolery.

dead fish in the Executive Com-

a?

vironment,”’ University Center’s ‘‘wildlife manager” said.

mittee room, nearby in the stu-
dent center. President Bennett
Ross passed along the corpse to
Chappell.

“The fish was dead, and I
mean by months! Someone put
it on my desk, and you could
smell it (in the hallway). As I
came around the corner and
saw the thing, I screamed! And
then Bennett got it,” she said,
her blue eyes rolling as she
laughed.

Then there was the time
someone left a dead turtle. And
don’t forget that Monday morn-
ing when her office was stuffed
with newspapers from floor to
ceiling.

“T can give it and I can take

it. I just love practical jokes, as
long as they’re not on me,”’ she
said.

With the fun, though, comes
work. And work she does. Be-
sides her secretarial duties, she
coordinates all job interviews
on campus and keeps the
bulletin board outside her office
loaded with notices.

This year she is president of
the University Women’s Feder-
ation, a group for employees on
campus as well as the wives of
all faculty and administrators.
ministrators.

On top of that, Chappell
triples as a student and wife.

Cryptogram kills cats

Curiosity may kill cats but
people seem to thrive on their
inquisitive bent. What is around
the next turn of the road? What

As a part-time student at
Mary Baldwin College, Chap-
pell is taking a course in W&L’s
psychology department.

“TI thought Psychology would
be common sense. My job is
basically common sense. So I
went in with a good attitude,”
she noted. But she gripes, too,
like any other student.

“This stuff is getting to me.
Last night I dreamed I was be-
ing chased by a medulla,”
Chappell joked.

9

Chappell lives in Lexington,
her home town, with her hus-
band Skip.

“My husband and I live in
Lexington, but he doesn’t work
in Lexington,’’ she said. ‘“There
aren’t too many accounting jobs
in Lexington.”

“You know, when the stu-
dents are gone, Lexington’s
really a bore.”

Chappell’s lively lifestyle en-
croaches on her home life,
Chappell admits. At least two
weekends a month are spent out
of town, and her being tied up
with work til after 5 p.m. makes
her “‘big on Stouffer’s (TV din-

ners).””

Above her desk is a small sign
printed on yellow paper: ‘‘Don’t
be afraid to hurt my feelings.
All you risk is my unbounded
rage.”

Yet, Chappell also can turn on
unbounded charm.

Within 30 minutes one after-
noon, some 14 students had
come through the office, and the
phone had rung a couple of
times. Chappell only took time
to brush her hair.

One student complained
about the weight room.

“You want me to volunteer
lifting weights?” she asked
him. “Carole,” he replied,
“people wouldn’t keep their
minds on lifting if you were
there.”’

‘What a friend,” she said,
hugging him.

Powell speaks

(continued from page 1)
Justice Warren E. Burger to tell
a magazine _ interviewer,
“There is a serious question
how long we can cope with this
flood of litigation.”

Although additional judges
have been appointed (there was
a 30 percent increase in federal
judgeships during the Carter
administration), Powell says
that still ‘‘the entire federal
system is overloaded.”

Powell told the students that
the percentage of the gross na-
tional product spent on lawyer’s
fees now exceeds the GNP seg-
ment produced by the steel in-
dustry. ‘‘The truth is that the
U.S. has become a litigious

society. People litigate now
about anything. The result is
now...an overload problem,”’ he
said.

In an August speech to the
American Judicature Society in
San Francisco, Associate
Justice John Paul Stevens pro-
posed the creation of a new
court that would not actually
decide Supreme Court cases on
their merits but would take over
the job of selecting cases for the
Supreme Court to hear. By giv-
ing up the case selection func-

tion, Justice Stevens said, the
Supreme Court would gain
more time for ‘‘their most im-
portant work’? — deciding
cases.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi, Powell said that
“there are better ways to
alleviate the overload problems
of our court.’ Regarding the
Stevens solution, he told the
students, ‘‘I do not think that is
the best solution by any means.
I think we should determine our
own docket.”’

There are a variety of solu-
tions available, according to
Powell. “‘Congress is going to
have to take a look at our
jurisdiction,’’ he said. ‘‘Most of
the proposals would involve
Congressional action.

“‘T would like to see our diver-
sity jurisdiction (power over
cases with the defendant from
one state and the plaintiff in
another) eliminated or
drastically reduced. This is a
very major factor in the dockets
of the courts at all levels,” he
said.

He would also like to see some

overdue for some limitation of

Constitutional issues which in-
volve guilt or innocence.”’
(That,) he told a reporter, ‘‘is
critical.”

federal judiciary is the
multitude of death penalty ap-
peals.

“There’s no end to these
cases — literally none, Powell
said. ‘‘There is a de facto
recognition that almost no one
who wishes not to be executed
will be executed.”

Many of these appeals, he
said, are based on ‘‘ineffective
counsel,’’ He drew laughs from
the audience by declaring, ‘‘If
you lose, you’re ineffective!”’

Powell believes fundamental
reform is needed. ‘‘I ...think we
should either abolish capital
punishment or it should be en-
forced. The present system and
the way it’s exploited brings the
law into disrespect. It also
leaves a thousand on death
row...

“The system ought to be
made to work or capital punish-
ment should be abolished,”’ he
stated.

When a student asked about
the proposed Equal Rights

 

maxell.

Amendment, Powell told her, ‘‘I
think 95 percent of the ERA has
already been adopted by the
United States Supreme Court,
though I realize reasonable peo-
ple can disagree with that. . .

“Past Court action assures as
far as the law can assure it. . .
that there will be equal rights
for women.’ However, he
said, “I don’t oppose the amend-
ment.” He pointed out that his
daughter is a lawyer who
strongly supports the ERA.

Regarding recent legislation
which would restrict Court
authority over prayer in the
public schools, Powell said, ‘‘I
suspect there are very few
lawyers or judges who would
Support as a proposition Con-
gress altering the Constitu-
tional jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court.

“If one believes in our system
— the separation of powers doc-
trine — the Supreme Court
must be respected as the final
arbiter of Constitutional
issues.”

Powell said he agreed with a
press account that called the
term that began a few weeks
ago not only the Court’s ‘‘most
crowded docket ever, but also
the most politically charged.”’
‘Sooner or later, Powell said,
“‘all the great issues of the day
reach. us.”’

He told the Phi, ‘‘We are

criticized for making political
and policy judgments when we
are a court of law. But many
such decisions are decisions
that Congress, in effect, has
forced the Court to make.”’ As
examples, he cited Brown vs.
the Board of Education and
other integration and busing
cases.

Among the most important
cases coming up in this term, he
said, are those regarding abor-
tion, creationism and the
copyright regulation of home
video recording. One case that
will generate an extraordinary
amount of attention regards the
validity of the one house veto
in U.S. Congress. ‘‘That will
be a major constitutional
decision, whichever way it
comes out,’ he said.

Powell is proud of the Court’s
procedure and tradition. As an
example, he said in an inter-
view, ‘‘the dissent function is an
effective, recognized, and Con-
stitutional part of the system’”’
He said, ‘You about never get
an opinion by everybody
without someone suggesting
something constructive regard-
ing it.

“It’s not easy to change the
Constitution except by our
Court and we should be very
careful about making those
changes unless they’re fun-
damental,’ he said.

A question Powell said he fre-
quently gets is about the health
of the Justices. ‘‘This Court has
one of the oldest average ages
in its history — six of us are
over 70.”’ Powell dismissed re-
cent speculation about the
possible illness of Justice
Thurgood Marshall. ‘‘Nothing
in the world is wrong with his
health,’ he said.

The most famous inside view
of the Burger Court available is
the bestseller of a few years ago
sarcastically titled ‘‘The
Brethren,” written by Bob
Woodward of Watergate fame
and Scott Armstrong, who is
rumored to have been ‘‘Deep
Throat.’ It was highly critical
of the Court and did not portray
some of the Justices in the most
favorable of lights.

‘I have never read the book,
but from what I’ve heard, the
book is not a serious book about
the Supreme Court,” Powell
said. He told the The Phi, ‘“‘It
presents the Supreme Court ina
light I do not think is accurate.
The Supreme Court is a far
more serious, careful institu-
tion than ‘The Brethren’ seem-

ed to suggest.”
He said, however, that he is
willing to have the Court

scrutinized, ‘“‘We’re one of the
most open bodies in Wash-
ington,’’ he said.

In his opening remarks,
Powell called the law school
“one of the best, if not the best,
law school facilities in the na-
tion.’’ Powell, a member of Phi
Beta Kappa, received his B.S.
from W&L in 1929, and earned
an LL.B. from the law school in
1931. The Justice, who was a
member of the Phi Delta Phi
fraternity here, is considered to
be one of the court’s moderates.
 

 

New leader keeps Sem small

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Phi Staff Writer

Southern Seminary’s Junior
College’s new president, Joyce
Davis, is committed to keeping
the school what it is today, a
very small school for women.
She thinks both the size and the
single sex population are essen-
tial to the academic at-
mosphere the school tries. to
create.

“The single sex population is
an inherent part of the school’s
character.”’ said Davis. ‘“There
is a certain tension that exists
between the sexes, and the
absence of the opposite sex
helps ease these tensions, mak-
ing a better environment for
study.”

It is also important to keep
the size of the school at about
300 students, said Davis, 47,
because it allows a high degree
of individulaized attention for
the students. In larger schools
some teachers are more like-
ly to be interested in do-
ing research or writing a
book than helping a student
with her work, stated Davis.
However, the small size of
Southern Seminary makes it
possible for a student to get help
from her teacher.

Davis, who had planned to
teach high school English was
encouraged to teach in college,
joined the Southern Seminary
faculty almost reluctantly in
1965. She was offered a tem-
porary position teaching
English, but was hesitant to ac-
cept because she wanted to
spend time with her two
children. But, fearing she would
not get another opportunity to
join the staff, she accepted the
offer.

In 1971 she became the
Academic Dean. ‘‘One goal I
had while I was dean was to im-
prove the academic program,”’
Davis stated, ‘‘I think that has
occurred.

“T have tried to find the peo-
ple with the highest academic
credentials possible,’ explain-
ed Davis.

She has also tried to get facul-
ty members that share the
“kind of attitude that was con-
sistent with the purposes of
Southern Seminary.’ Davis
especially tried to get a faculty
that was willing to deal with the
students as individuals, with
their special problems and
fears.

She is optimistic about being
able to continue improving the
school in the future, but has ‘‘a
lot of anxiety about the next ten
years.”’ Declining enrollment
because of fewer college-aged
students will pose a major pro-

blem for small private univer-
sities because their operating
costs will stay the same while a
small number of students will
have to foot the bill.

By ‘‘merchandising’’
Seminary more actively, and by
broadening their recruitment
activities, Davis hopes to keep

 

the enrollment up, and tuitions
down. She also hopes to attract
more contributions and en-
dowments from the public to
help students afford college.

She thinks the ~ colleges
themselves, as well as_ the
private sector, will be able to
make up for much of the finan-
cial aid lost from state and
federal sources, but concedes
the cuts will hurt some
students.

She also foresees other .

changes on college campuses in
the near future.

Students today, Davis said,
‘go to college almost with tun-
nel vision.’’ Students decide
what their major is going to be,
and limit themselves to working
towards that their freshman
year, maintains Davis.
Students tend to go into ‘‘mean-
ingful”’ courses that will help
their majors, like English, the
sciences and math. They avoid
courses like art and music
because they are ‘‘useless.”’

This will change, said Davis,
as college reverse the trend of
the ’60s and ’70s by becoming
more rigid in the distribution
requirements, making students
take a wider range of subjects

 

AST LEX |

in their first two years of col-
lege. Thus students will start
concentrating on their majors
in their junior year, as was done
in the past.

Southern Seminary in the
past few years has started re-
quiring more distribution. ‘‘I’m
a firm believer in all those
‘useless’ things,”’ said Davis.

Washington and Lee students
are viewed by the rest of the
community as “‘liking to par-
ty,” she said laughing. Many
people see the stereotypical
W&L student as ‘‘rich kids from
prep school who come here to
party and study as little as
possible before going on to
medical school, law school or
daddy’s business,” she said, ad-
ding that people usually take
students as really they are after
meeting them.

Although holding reserva-
tions about the next dacade,
Davis is optimistic that
Southern Seminary will be able
to adapt and stay ‘‘up with the
times.”’

“‘What we teach today is very
different from the past.’’ added
Davis. Change in the future,
Davis said will be “‘sensitive to
changing needs for women.”’

Finally,

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

Coach Page Remillard has
finally gotten the monkey off his
back: The Slippery Rock water
polo jinx is no more.

Despite a 1-2 record in the
Bucknell Invitational (15-6
overall) last weekend, the W&L
water polo Generals got the one
victory they’ve been looking for
over the past two years. The
Generals outplayed and out-
classed the Slippery Rock
Rockets, winning 16-11.

Earlier in the tourney, W&L
fell to Navy 10-7 and Brown, the

eventual tournament runner-up
to the New York AC, 14-8.

Sports

water polo downs Slippery Rock

‘‘We’re
satisfied,”

Satisfied, very
said a beaming
Remillard who noted that
despite the two losses, the
Generals are probably the third
best team on the East Coast,
and are as close to top-rated
Brown as anyone.

In the first game of the
weekend Brown simply outex-
perienced W&L, but all was not
lost. The Generals scouted
Brown heavily and gained
much food for thought as they
work towards a possible future
match-up at the Eastern cham-
pionships next month.

In the Navy contest, Remil-
lard filed a just protest that was

strangely denied. With less than
five minutes to play and Navy
leading by two goals, junior

- Tim Rock was sent off for a 45-

second penalty. As a result of
poor scorekeeping, Rock re-
mained off for over two minutes
allowing Navy to score and
establish a solid three goal lead.

The obvious mistake was not
rescinded by the committee as
they felt it was in the better in-
terest of the tournament to let
the result stand.

The highlight of the Generals’
weekend, however, was saved
for last. Junior Kevin Kadesky
and senior Bob Marshall team-
ed in goal to deny Slippery Rock

Harriers finish a ‘respectable’ fifth

‘Our performance was more
than respectable’ was how
Washington and Lee cross-
country coach Dick Miller
described his team’s showing at
the Virginia State Division II .
and III Championships Satur-
day at W&L.

Paced by junior Angus
McBryde’s 12th place finish, the
Generals placed fifth overall
with 135 points. Liberty Baptist
scored 28 points to win the
event, followed by Radford
(56), Christopher Newport
(120), and Lynchburg (131).

McBryde's time for the 8000-
meter course was 27:25. Behind
McBryde for the Generals were
sophomore Frank Pittman in
16th place with a time of 27:33,

CA

senior John Kelafant in 22nd
place, freshman Bob Glenn in
39th place and sophomore Paul
Chapman in 46th place. 73 run-
ners competed in the event.
‘Breaking down the scores
into head-to-head results, I’d
say the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship race
will be a two- or three-team

race between us, Lynchburg
and Roanoke,”’ said Miller.

Seven teams will compete in
that meet, to be held November
6 at Washington and Lee.

W&L will play host to Bridge-
water College and West
Virginia Tech at 11:30 a.m.
Saturday. The Generals dual
meet record is 6-1.

H-SC defenses W&L,
takes ODAC lead

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Washington & Lee’s football
team lost for the first time in
this year’s Old Dominion Athle-
tic Conference play Saturday,
as Hampden-Sydney upset the
Generals 3-0 on Wilson Field.

The loss dropped W&L to 3-1
in the league and diminishes the
Generals’ chances of capturing
a second consecutive ODAC
crown. Hampden-Sydney, now
3-0 in the ODAC, must lose one
of its two remaining league
games with Emory & Henry
and Randolph Macon in order
for the Generals to have a
chance to tie for the title.

“I’m telling my team just to
worry about the next game.
Don’t worry about the league,”
W&L Coach Gary Fallon said.

It was a particularly disap-
pointing loss for the Generals
though, as they had several op-
portunities to pull out the win.

cards. We win together as a
team, we lose together as a
team,”’ Fallon declared.

After a scoreless first half,
Hampden-Sydney took advan-
tage of a short punt to set up the
only score of the game. The
Hampsters took possession at
the W&L 34 yard line and drove
into field goal range. With 3:29
left in the third quarter, Hiter
Harris nailed a 32-yard field
goal to give the Hampsters a 3-0
lead.

W&L’s best opportunity to
pull the game out came midway
through the fourth quarter. The
Generals took control of the ball
at the Hampden-Sydney 45, and
quickly drove to the 10 yard
line. An 18-yard pass from John
Thompson to Ken Robinson and
a 12-yard pass to Jerry Thomp-
son provided key first downs
along the way.

At the 10 yard line, the drive
stalled. John Thompson’s se-
cond down pass seemed headed _
for tight end Dave Judge in the

' end zone, but a Hampden-

Sydney defensive back deflect-
ed the ball away at the last mo-
ment. ‘That kid did make a
spectacular play to knock down
the pass to Judge,” Fallon con-
ceded.

On fourth down, the Generals
lined up for a 30-yard field goal
attempt. The snap bobbled
slightly, and Bill Devine’s kick
sailed wide left.

Offensive collapse in three easy steps

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Sports Editor
First, the Washington and

Lee offense sputtered on Wilson '

Field last Saturday.

Then it fizzled.

And then it died.

And when the cold, windy
afternoon had come to an end,
Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers had
handed the Generals their first
shutout since a 28-0 loss to Get-
tysburg early in the 1980 cam-
paign.

The Hampden-Sydney of-
fense, which had only scored 35
points in five games this season
would only score three points on
this day. But that was enough as
their defense held the Generals
at every turn.

And the net result was that
Washington and Lee will need
nothing short of a miracle to
win their second Old Dominion
Athletic Conference title. With
the loss, W&L. dropped to 3-1 in
the ODAC, while H-S upped its
record to 3-0.

The Generals will have to
defeat Bridgewater on Oct. 30
and hope that the Tigers lose
their remaining two ODAC con-
tests. However, both of those
games will be at home for H-S.
They will host Emory and
Henry and Randolph-Macon.

Football

(continued from page 10)
on the ball one more time, at
their own 27 yard line with
about two minutes left. Junior
quarterback Al Paradise came
off the bench to complete a 20-
yard pass to Chris Cavalline for
a crucial first down, but the
Generals could not pick up
another first down. With 1:06
left in the game, Paradise’s
fourth down pass was _in-
tercepted at the Hampden-
Sydney 11 yard line.

On the positive side, W&L’s
defense played one of their bet-
ter games of the year. They
held Hampden-Sydney to 187
yards of total offense and only 6
first downs.

“They played good football,
but that was the poorest offen-
sive team we’ve seen,’’ said
Fallon of his defense’s effort.
“I’m not taking anything away
from our defense though,’ he
concluded.

This Saturday at Wilson Field
the Generals will try to raise
their overall record to 4-2
against the University of the
South. Sewanee brings a 4-2
record into the game.

Open 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.

The Generals’ offense had
been rated as perhaps the tops
in the league coming into the
season, yet it failed to

* materialize on Saturday.

There are, of course, several
reasons for this that would im-
mediately strike the untrained
eye. First, starting quarterback
Al Paradise and starting slot-
back Jerry Thompson were in-
jured, although both saw a little
bit of action. However, W&L
ran. up 28 points against Mary-
ville two weeks ago without
these two performers.

Secondly, was the wind and

the cold that made the passing
game difficult. Yet, the Gener-
als seemed to deviate from
their normal trickery and re-
verse-direction plays that will
get any running game untrack-
ed and, in turn, help the passing
game. Normally, several times
a game, on a sweep, tailback
Chris Cavalline will either hand
the ball to the slotback going the
other way or will fake that
handoff just to keep the defense
honest. Coach Gary Fallon’s
Generals ran that play only
once Saturday, and it is pro-
bably not coincidental that

|

Cavalline only gained 35 yards
on 21 carries.

Also, Cavalline, who led the
Generals with 11 receptions, on-
ly caught one pass coming out
of the backfield. In fact, the
Generals passing game as a
whole was rather lackadaisical
as Paradise and starter John
Thompson combined to throw
three interceptions and many of
their completions were just
safety valve passes for short
yardage.

Another factor contributing to
the team’s demise was penal-
ties. Although W&L was only
flagged six times for 42 yards in
the fast-paced game, two of the
penalties wiped out first downs
and two eliminated long
Cavalline punts. Giving credit
where credit is due, however,
the W&L defense did an excep-
tional job of shutting down the
H-S attack, especially since
they were on the field a large
portion of the game.

Soccer ties Lynchburg
improves to 5-2-2

Freshman Bill Holmes’ goal midway through the second half
enabled the Washington and Lee soccer team to tie Division III
powerhouse Lynchburg 1-1 on Wilson Field Tuesday.

Holmes’ header above the Hornets’ goalie’s head gave the
Generals a 1-0 lead. However, Lynchburg retaliated with a goal
four minutes later. A diving save by W&L goalie Kirk Mancer kept
the Generals’ chances alive, but neither team was able to score in
the two ten-minute overtime periods.

At the 4:06 mark of the first overtime, the Hornets had an ex-
cellent chance to score as Mancer was beaten by a Hornet forward.

However, his shot into an open goal was from too much of an angle ~

and rolled right across the front of the net.

The tie marked the first time since 1974 that W&L has not lost to
Lynchburg.

Earlier in the week, two goals by sophomore Jeff Reichert had
powered W&L to a 6-1 crushing of Gettysburg College. Senior Brad
Poorman and junior Roland Simon each added a goal and an assist.

Last Saturday, however, Messiah College scored two goals in the
final six minutes of the game to down W&L by a 2-0 count. Senior
Tad Renner and sophomore Rob Coleman were named players-of-
the-game.

The Generals will host Division II rival Radford Saturday on
Wilson Field at 10:00 a.m. Next Wednesday, they will face VMI in
the annual United Way game to be held at VMI.
