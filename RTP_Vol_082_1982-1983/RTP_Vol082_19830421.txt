Byrd blasts spending, judges

Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr., the
Virginia Independent who end-
ed 18 years in the U.S. Senate
when he retired this year, cited
his continuing concern with un-
controlled spending in Washing-
ton during a _ speech at
Washington and Lee University
Wednesday night.

Byrd also told the Lee Chapel
audience that he _ believes
federal judges should not have
lifetime tenure.

“We are mortgaging the
future of the young men and
women of our country,’’ said
Byrd, whose appearance at
W&L was sponsored by the
Tucker Law Forum in the W&L
School of Law. “Unless you
assume the government can
spend all the money it wants

and no one will have to pay for
it, then what we are doing is
saying that we of this genera-
tion are not going to pay for the
spending, but will let you folks
who come along later pay for
eo

Byrd argued that “spending
in Washington has gotten totally
out of control’ because there is
no discipline in the Congress
when it comes to spending
federal funds.

“Some way there must be
discipline brought, else we are
going to face catastrophe in the
money markets,’’ he said. “I’m
not contending that money is of
primary importance. I’m say-

ing that it is of primary impor-
tance only in the sense that in-
dividual citizens have to suffer
the consequences of overspend-
ing. There is only one place that
government can get money, and
that’s out of the pockets of peo-
ple who work.”

Byrd added that he knows of
only one way to bring such
discipline to the Congress — a
Constitutional amendment

mandating a balanced budget.

“I do not like the Constitution
cluttered with too many amend-
ments, but I have reached the
conclusion now that there is no
other way to bring discipline to
the men and women who serve
in the Congress of the United
States,’ Byrd added.

“For almost 20 years the
federal government has been

Russian defector
speaks Monday

Arkady Shevchenko, the
highest ranking Soviet official
ever to defect to the West, will
present ‘A View From The
Kremlin” at Washington and
Lee University on Monday,
April 25.

Shevchenko will speak in
W&L’s Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. as
part of Contact ’83, a speaker
symposium sponsored jointly
by the student body and the in-
terfraternity council at Wash-
ington and Lee.

The program is open to the
public at no charge.

When he defected in April
1978, Shevchenko was Moscow’s
top-ranking official on the staff
of the United Nations where he
was Under Secretary General.

The Ukrainian-born Shev-
chenko received a Ph.D. in in-
ternational law from Moscow’s
Diplomatic Institute. He was
first posted to the United Na-
tions in 1963 as a counselor in
the Soviet Mission and served in
New York for seven years. He
then returned to Moscow as an
adviser to Foreign Minister An-
drei Gromyko and reached am-
bassadorial rank at the unusu-
ally early age of 40.

In 1973 he was sent back to the
United Nations as Under
Secretary General and served
as Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim’s principal assistant
in the Department of Political
and Security Council Affairs
and was familiar with Soviet
positions on strategic arms.

 

Cocaine

te

RE8&

Student arrested, charged

with intent to distribute

By BILL ROBERTS
Editor-in-Chief

A Washington and Lee
University junior has been ar-
rested and-charged with posses-
sion of cocaine with intent to
distribute after Virginia State
Police entered his house on Mc-
Corkle Dr. with a search war-
rant.

Marc A. Ham, 21, of Seaford,
Del., was arrested by state
police Saturday night, April 16,
after they confiscated three
ounces of cocaine from his
room, according to _ police
records. ;

The arrest is the second in a
coordinated investigation by
Rockbridge County Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
‘“John’”’ Read, the Lexington
Police Department and the
Virginia State Police.

“It is the largest seizure of co-
caine we've ever had in ‘this
community,” Read said in an
interview Tuesday. ‘‘It is also
very unfortunate.”

Eric Lee Sisler, Ham’s
defense attorney, said that a
preliminary hearing date has
been set for May 27.

On the evening of the arrest,
Ham was held briefly in the
Rockbridge jail and released on
a $20,000 bond.

Polygraph test

State Police Special Agent
Wayne M. Oyler, assisted by
Lexington Police Officer Steven
V. Crowder, conducted the
search at 8:04 p.m. The warrant
was requested on Monday,
April 11, and State Police
Magistrate Charles F. Engle-
man issued the warrant for ‘‘co-
caine and other parapher-
nalia.”’

Items confiscated in the.

search include; a piece of paper
with figures, six plastic baggies
with corners missing, a coke
kit, a glass water pipe, a glass
bottle with white residue, a
hacksaw blade with white
residue, a picture with a line of
cocaine, a metal and wood
Snorting stem, and a prepara-
tion kit.

The first arrest in the drug in-
vestigation occurred on Febru-
ary 4.

W&L sophomore Charles M.

Phillips, of Montclair, N.J., was
arrested and charged with pos-
session of cocaine with intent to
distribute after state police
searched his car with a
narcotics-alert dog. Approx-
imately one ounce of cocaine
with an estimated street value
of $2,400 was found in Phillips’
car, Crowder said.

O’Conner wants

charges dropped

By PHIL MURRAY
Phi Staff Writer

A Washington and Lee soph-.

omore charged with possession
of cocaine says he passed a
polygraph test this week and
now hopes that the charge will
be dropped.

Kevin B. O’Connor, of
Baltimore, Md., was arrested
on Feb. 28 after lab reports
identified a substance found in
his room during Christmas
vacation as cocaine.

A Lexington police officer
discovered a very small amount
of cocaine in the room at the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity

house on Lee Avenue on Dec. 17
while he was investigating a
possible break-in there. All of
the students living in the house
had left for vacation.

O’Connor requested the
polygraph test after he was ar-
rested. State Police in Salem
administered the test on Tues-
day, which O’Connor | says
verified his contention that the
cocaine was not his.

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. “John” Read had no
comment Wednesday about
whether his office would drop
the charges.

No date has been set for a
preliminary hearing.

Editorial
Faculty moves

without input

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

Item: Rumors are circulating around campus to the
effect that one or more university administrators are
in favor of Washington and Lee going coeducational,
an action that would have to pass the Board of
Trustees.

Item: The faculty quietly approved the new distribu-
tion requirements a few weeks ago. These are the
same guidelines that met with widespread student op-
position when first proposed last fall.

Item: The plus-minus grading system will go into ef-
fect in the fall, according to next year’s catalog. Will
it affect upperclassmen or only freshmen? Has that
even been decided yet?

Each of these proposed changes affects each and
every student in one way or another, but the purpose
of this column is not do discuss their pros and cons.

Rather, let us examine how these changes have oc-
curred or might occur.

Very few students had any idea that the faculty was
even considering a plus-minus grading system until it
was finally approved and reported in the Ring-tum
Phi. And the only way the Phi learned of it was
through a news office press release that merely listed
the vote for and against.

’ By the time the Ring-tum Phi had reported the ac-
tion it was over and done with and students were
stuck with the new system, whether they liked it or
not.

In addition, the question of who this new grading
system will affect has seen little student input.

When the faculty took up the new distribution re-
quirements last fall, the student Executive Commit-
tee quickly responded with a strongly worded letter to
the faculty urging defeat of the new requirements.

“REAL AMERICANS MUST BE PROTECTED F

However, there was little other student input into the
problem as most students simply took the attitude of
“it doesn’t affect me anyway.”

Postponing a decision until another committee
made a recommendation, the faculty decided at their
last meeting to accept the new requirements. Again,
there was no student input, and the Phi did not even
report this action.

There are only a couple of ways to resolve this pro-
blem of lack of student input into decisions other than
er much money the International Club will get from

e EC.

First, all faculty meetings should be open to
students and Phi reporters. Lexington City Council
does not operate in private — why should our faculty?

Students have a right to know what is being debated
and what policy changes are about to occur so they
can influence the final decision.

Although they need not necessarily be allowed to
participate in the meetings, by knowing what the
faculty is discussing, students can help influence the
decision through later discussions with faculty
members and letters to the Phi.

Secondly, while Board of Trustees’ meetings
possibly ought to be kept private due to the personnel
matters often debated, there should be a non-voting
student member on the board.

Many colleges around the state have instituted this
so that, once again, students can have some idea what
is going on inside the Board of Trustees and can in-
fluence a decision that will undoubtedly affect them.

Every couple of years, it seems that the debate over
coeducation comes to the fore, and whether or not
there is any truth to the latest rumors is irrelevant.
What is important is that Washington and Lee could
conceivably go coeducational without any student in-
put.

Theoretically, the Board of Trustees could vote for
W&L to go coed and, just like that, could tear down 250
years of tradition.

That, then, is the key to the whole situation.

Students have a right to participate in the decision-
making process when the outcome will affect their
academic, social and financial or athletic situation at
the university.

And the only way to accomplish this goal is to open
faculty meetings to students and to have a non-voting
student member on the Board of Trustees. In this
way, there will be less rumor and suspicion about
what goes on at these meetings and more facts and
productive decision-making for the benefit of all.

Alumni Colleges

Summer academics expanded for 2nd year

Washington and Lee
University’s campus will be
busier than ever this summer
when the university’s expan-
ding summer programs expand
even further.

Although W&L does not con-
duct any credit-granting
academic programs in the sum-
mer, the university has in-
stituted a number of new sum-
mer programs during the last
several years.

According to Robert Fure,
director of summer programs
at W&L, the university’s cam-
pus will be the site of 15 dif-
ferent conferences, clinics, and
athletic camps from June 12
through August 5.

Those programs will include
three different sessions of the
W&L Alumni College which was
first offered a year ago. The
sessions will each have a dif-
ferent theme and will include

_ Elderhostel,

daily lectures and discussion
groups led by Washington and
Lee faculty members along
with recreational opportunities.

The first Alumni College,
“Law and Society,” is schedul-
ed for June 26 through July 2.
The second, focusing on the

- antebellum South, will be July

10 through July 16. The third,
which will have Japan as its
topic, will be July 31 through
August 6.

Another program that was in-
augurated a year ago and is ex-
panding this summer is the
which offers
lowcost, short-term residential
academic programs to older
adults. There’ will be two
Elderhostels at Washington and
Lee this summer. The first will
be July 3 through July 9 while
the second will be July 24
through July 30.

Faculty Autobiography |

Turner not a‘Straw in

By ALLEN S. ROBERTS
News Editor

The title of Dr. Charles W.
Turner’s newly-published
autobiography is misleading.
“Chuck” Turner’s character,
though humble before his faith,
contradicts the image of “A
Straw in the Wind.”

Dr. Turner overcame
childhood paralysis and the
economic adversity of the Great
Depression, earning a scholar-
ship which enabled him to enter
the University of Richmond at
the age of 15.

As a 19-year-old graduate,
Turner taught math, civics and
biology at Apple Grove High
School. For three years he
educated (and was teased by)
students nearly his age, ‘‘walk-
ing back and forth daily from
Oak Shade with the Harris boys,
laughing and joking all the
way.” “‘I soon decided,”’ Turner
recalls, “I would rather do
graduate work and apply for a
college teaching job.”

This he found here at
Washington and Lee, after ear-
ning his Ph.D. at the University
of Minnesota. Turner began
teaching history ‘‘on the hill”’ in
1946, when his classes were fill-

ed by GI’s returning from the
war, some of whom were older
than their professor.

For 45 years, Dr. Turner en-
joyed “‘the teaching of history”
which “allowed me to tell a
great story and never tire...To
help a student, especially one

not doing so well, has been my |

life and work...The greatest
thing in my life was when I was
put in duPont Hall, Room 1 in
the basement, I have been able

Washington and Lee is one of
more than 500 colleges and uni-
versities participating in the
elderhostel program. Each of
the two sessions will involve ap-
proximately 50 participants.

The first program of the sum-
mer will be the Institute for Ex-
ecutives, a two-week confer-
ence in which middle-level ex-
ecutives engage in an intense
study of the humanities. This is
the third summer that W&L has
sponsored the institute, which
will begin June 12 and continue
through June 24.

Summer Scholars ’83, . sche-
duled for July 3 through July 30,
is a month-long program of
rigorous, college-level
academic work for students
who will be entering their senior
years in high school in the fall.

fered for the third time this
summer, is deSigned to give

had attended summer schools

life before his students. As a

Kimbrough, Novack

present prison paper

Emory Kimbrough Jr. and
David R. Novack, sociology
professors at Washington and
Lee University, presented a
paper on prison organization to
the 46th annual meeting of the
Southern Sociological Society in
Atlanta earlier this month.

Entitled ‘‘Organization
Theory as Applied to Prison
Organization and Analysis,”
Kimbrough’s portion of the
paper was written while he was
a participant in a seminar at
Worcester College, Oxford
University, during the summer

of 1982.

Novack’s contribution grew
out of his long-standing interest
in penology and criminology
and, more particularly, from
his participation in a National
Endowment for the Humanities
seminar on ‘Crime and Punish-
ment in America’”’ held at the
University of Virginia during
the summer of 1979.

Kimbrough, professor of
sociology, has been a member
of the W&L faculty since 1962
while Novack, associate pro-
fessor of sociology, joined the
faculty in 1976.

Glasgow Endowment

Polish poet lectures in spring

Piotr Sommer, a Polish poet,
critic, and translator, is the
Glasgow Visiting Poet and Lec-
turer at Washington and Lee
University for the spring term.

Sommer, who arrived in Lex-
ing on Sunday, will be in
residence during Washington
and Lee’s six-week spring term
which began Monday (April 18)
and will present readings from
his works as well as a series of
lectures.

The first of Sommer’s presen-
tations will be on Wednesday,
April 27, at 4:30 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library. Sommer will read in
English but will also give a
sample of how the poems sound
in Polish. The reading is open to
the public.

Sommer will give lectures on
May 11, May 18, and May 25 at 4
p.m., also in Northen Auditor-
ium. Those lectures will be open
to the public.

Born in Walbrzych, Poland, in
1948, Sommer was graduatcd

from the University of Warsaw
in 1973.

He is associate editor of a
monthly journal of letters
published in Warsaw.

Three volumes of Sommer’s
poetry have been published:
“In the Chair’’ (1977), ‘‘Keep-
sakes Left Behind’ (1980), and
“Subsequent World’’ (1983). He
is also the author of a volume of
children’s verse entitled ‘‘Be-
fore Bedtime”’ (1981).

English translations of Som-
mer’s work have appeared in
“Prairie Schooner’’; ‘“‘Shenan-
doah,”’ the Washington and Lee
literary magazine; ‘‘The
Honest Ulsterman,” published

in Northern Ireland; and,
“Eureka 12,’’ published in
Sweden.

In Poland, he has published
poetry in ‘‘Wiez,” “‘Tworzosc,”
“Nowy Wyraz,” ‘“Odra,’”’ and
other national periodicals.

His criticism and translations
of contemporary British, Irish,

and American poets appear
regularly in ‘Literatura na
Swiecie,”’ the journal of which
he is associate editor. He was
chief editor in December, 1979,
of an issue of that journal which
was largely devoted to the work
of Robert Lowell and John Ber-
ryman.

Sommer is currently trans-
lating the work of Frank
O’Hara.

The Glasgow Visiting Lec-
tureship is part of the Glasgow
Endowment Program estab-
lished at Washington and Lee

Internships near deadline

College students interested in
working in summer jobs in their
chosen professional fields
should apply now for the
thousands of corporate and
governmental internships and
work-study opportunities
available.

According to the Scholarship
Bank, most internships are
sponsored by major corpora-
tions and pay in the range of two
to three thousand for the sum-
mer. Many will pay students’
relocation expenses. These in-
ternships are good sources of
training and may lead to per-

manent employment as well as
invaluable contacts in the stu-
dent’s chosen field. In addition,
internees can qualify for
scholarships and other financial
aid from many of _ these
employers.

Many deadlines are near for
these programs. Students in-
terested in receiving more in-
formation about these intern-
ships and scholarships should
send a business sized stamped
self-addressed envelope to The

Hickman text lauded

A biology textbook written
by Washington and Lee Univer-
sity professor Cleveland P.
Hickman Jr. was recently hon-
ored by the Chicago Book Clinic
Annual Exhibit.

The third edition of the
volume entitled ‘Biology of
Animals,” published in 1982 by
the C.V. Mosby Company was
cited by the judges in the
Text/Reference category for its
exceptional handling of com-
plex subject matter as well as
its design and illustrations.

Hickman was the author of
the volume with Larry S.
Roberts of Texas Tech Univer-

sity and Frances M. Hickman,
emeritus professor at DePauw
University. The book’s chief
aim is to ‘‘present the concepts
and principles of zoology that
provide a basis for understand-
ing the nature, diversity, and
functioning of animals.”’

The 646-page book has 861 il-
lustrations, including 391 in col-
or. The first volume was pub-
lished in 1972 while the second
volume was published in 1978.

Hickman joined the W&L
faculty in 1967 after previously
serving as associate professor
of zoology at the University of
Alberta.

     
 

of the designated area’s history
whether or not to investigate
the area.”

Should the state center decide
a survey of an area is needed,

an archeological firm — often a
school in the area with an ar-

cheological curriculum — is
asked to submit a bid for the
contract to survey the area.

‘When an archeological team
surveys the area, there are
basically three phases of in-
vestigation. The first phase in-
volves a search for artifacts
and a survey of the area, a
general search. The second
phase begins with the discovery

of an artifact and investigation
of that artifact, its age, use, and
material. The third phase,
which is probably the only
phase which can uphold con-
struction of any project, in-
volves a thorough excavation of
the area should investigation of

the artifacts warrant this,”

noted McDaniels.

Only once has a crew
McDaniels instructed upheld
construction. An excavation in
Lebanon, Va., unearthed an In-
dian campsite of considerable
historical and archeological
value.

‘In the Botetourt survey we
decided there were enough sites
of that kind. There was no need
to investigate there more
thoroughly,’’ McDaniels said.
“Just because we find one ar-
rowhead they don’t need to
move a building.”

Commentary

Banana Manana

By MARKHAM PYLE
Special to the Phi

Well, I’d hoped to be able to
write a short bucolic bit about
my hometown of Crosby, Texas
(pop. unnoticeable). I wanted to
tell y’all about what the boys
are up to down at the Gum Gully
icehouse; how the rice farmers
and the cattlemen are still
feuding down on Wahl Street;
and how old John Bob Lamkin
made the acquaintance of Mr.
Drastata’s prized Brahma bull.
It’ll just have to wait, though. I
simply must. enter the fray, and
consider with y’all the situation
in Central America.

The only point I want to
make, one that seems to have
been overlooked in the heat of
argument on the subject, is
this: Justice is not relative; but
it does not follow from this that
Tom Hayden and Alan Cranston
are necessarily right in saying
what it is. In Central America
or in Iowa. Justice (and, until
the next Excelsior, you'll just
have to take my word for it) is
an Ideal, which various court
systems may approximate to a
greater or lesser degree. If we
accept this proposition, it
follows that the two questions
we ought to ask about any court
system or any law case are: is
the process fair? And, is the end
morally right? We up here are
unfamiliar with Central
American legal process, and we
tend to confuse unfamiliarity
with injustice. Most of the
Western world operates, not on
the common law basis we know,
but on the basis of the old
Roman civil law. In, say, El
Salvador, this is mediated
through the Spanish ex-
perience; in Mexico or Loui-
siana, it is French in origin. But
these are basically the same;
and they are indeed unlike the
Anglo-American notions of law.
So, what is done in Central
America may seem very unlike

what we call just process of the
legal system. But it may on its
own terms quite as adequately
approximate the just ideal. We
can see if it does by asking what
criterion of the just end it ap-
peals to (preservation of pro-
perty, say, is even when abus-
ed, more just than the Sandinist
ideals will be), and whether its
process was fair and equitable
or whether it was skewed by
respect to persons or
ideological purity. It may be in
fact that civil-law constructs
are inherently less capable of
approximating justice. If this
were to be so, we should, in
practice, credit the attempts to
make the most of a bad job by
various regimes in attempting
to administer justice; and
where they err, we should try to
correct the unfortunate exigen-
cies of the situation. But we
must do so organically, by ex-
panding fundamental concepts
in the prevailing ideology which
conduce to just practice, rather
than by imposing alien struc-
tures on a a people. After all,
that’s the cultural imperialism
the Left is always whining
about when it’s directed at a
Mitterand or a Castro. Perhaps,
before we start frothing at the
mouth about the Salvadoran
government, legally elected
and properly constituted though
it is (nobody’s perfect, and we
can’t all be Castroite ter-
rorists), we might first look at
what they’ve got to work with,
what they’re trying to do, how
well they’re doing it with what
they’ve got...and what the alter-
native would be like. The nice
thing about rightist, Catholic
regimes in Central America is:
there is that in their ideology
and in their consciences which
allows repentance. The pro-
blem with movements that have
all the answers is that they
shoot you if you have questions.

Blackboards redefine gallery

When is a classroom not a
classroom?

The answer? When it is a
work of art, naturally.

And beginning April 20, the
art exhibition in Washington
and Lee University’s duPont
Gallery will be a classroom.
And vice versa.

DuPont Gallery’s latest offer-
ing is an art installation which,
explains duPont Gallery direc-
tor Debora Rindge, seeks to
transform and redefine the
traditional gallery or museum
space.

“Rather than treating the
gallery as a utilitarian environ-
ment which serves solely as a
showplace for art objects, the
installation incorporates the
gallery into the work of art,
making it an inherent element
of the piece,”’ explains Rindge,
an instructor in art history at
Washington and Lee.

A major feature of the duPont
Gallery installation will be a
series of blackboards on which
six Washington and Lee pro-
fessors made notations that
they would routinely make duir-
ng one of their lectures.

9:30 til ?

The professor-artists who
created the blackboards repre-
sent a variety of subjects, rang-
ing from music to chemistry to
lacrosse. Gallery visitors will
be treated to visual lectures on
organic chemistry, plans for a
Generals’ lacrosse victory, and
a medieval method of musical
notation.

“‘Blackboard markings share
characteristics which are com-
mon to paintings, prints, and
drawings,” observes Rindge.
“The blackboard is flat and is
often filled with lines, shapes,
symbols, and colors — the basic
vocabulary of two-dimensional
art forms.

“Seen in the traditional
classroom, the marked black-
board is appreciated only for its
function as a support to the lec-
ture. When the blackboard is
removed from its practical con-
tex and viewed in the context of
an art gallery, it is seen
primarily for its visual forms
rather than its informational
content.”’

Rindge and W&L assistant art
professor Larry Stene recruited
the professors to become black-
board artists.

“We chose professors for
their potential in creating
visually interesting markings
based on their particular sub-
ject,’ Stene explained. ‘Each
of the professors we approach-
ed was more than happy to par-
ticipate. They took their work
quite seriously.”’

The six  professor-artists
whose blackboards appear in
the installation are James
Cook, assistant professor of
music;. Chuck O’Connell, assis-
tant professor of physical
education and _ assistant
lacrosse coach; Harrison
Pemberton Jr., professor of
philosophy; Robert Pour, in-
structor in mathematics; ©
James Keith Shillington, pro-
fessor of chemistry; and,
Pamela H. Simpson, associate
professor of art history.

Though central to the installa-
tion, the blackboards are com-
plemented by student desks, a
podium, a clock, and assorted
other furnishings that would
typically be found in a
classroom.

“With the installation we are
seeking to expand the visual
awareness of the viewer by sug-
gesting that the creation of art
occurs in many environments
outside of art studios,
museums, and galleries,’’ Rin-
dge added.

In addition to Rindge and
Stene, the committee that
organized the installation in-
cluded Washington and Lee
senior Amory LeCuyer and
W&L junior Peter Cronin.

DuPont Gallery is open to the
public without charge. The
gallery hours are 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3
p.m. Saturdays, and 2 p.m. to 4
p.m. Sundays.

Spring Term

Professors take groups

abroad during Spring

For the next six weeks
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s campus will reach well
beyond the city limits of Lex-
ington as W&L students literal-
ly will be spread across the
globe for the university’s six-
week spring term.

Washington and Lee is one of
about a dozen colleges and
universities to operate under an
academic calendar that in-
cludes a six-week term at the
end of the academic year.

The term is used for a wide
variety of special projects,
ranging from numerous off-
campus internships to several
study abroad opportunities.

This year, for instance, W&L
students will be studying in
England, France, Germany,
Spain, Japan, the Galapagos
Islands, and the Rocky Moun-
tains, tonamea few.

John M. Evans, professor of
English, will have 18 students
participating in the seminar in
England. In addition to spend-
ing four of the six weeks in Lon-
don, the students will travel to
places such as Bath, Oxford,
Stratford, and Cambridge dur-
ing two of the weeks.

G. Francis Drake, professor
of romance languages, and 12
students will be in Paris for the
six-week term. The course is
designed to give the students
direct exposure to the language,
culture, and people of France.
Students live with French
families while in Paris.

M. Kirkland Follo, instructor
in German, and nine students

Turner

will spend the term in
Bayreuth, Germany, while five
W&L students will be in Madrid
accompanied by a_ professor
from Southwestern of Memphis.

Minor L. Rogers, associate
professor of religion, has ac-
companied five students to
Japan where they will be study-
ing at Kansi Gaidai, a school in
Osaka.

Not all the off-campus pro-
grams involve foreign language
study of course.

A group of nine biology
students and W&L biology pro-
fessor Cleveland Hickman will
spend a major portion of the six-
week term in the Galapagos
Islands, Darwin’s ‘‘evolu-
tionary showcase”’ off the coast
of Ecuador. Meantime, 14 geol-
ogy students and W&L pro-
fessors Edgar Spencer and
Doug Burns will be in the Rocky
Mountains for three weeks of
the term.

In addition, the spring term
affords W&L students the op-
portunity for many off-campus
internships as part of indepen-
dent study. Students in politics
courses are interning in a varie-
ty of offices in Washington, for
instance, while a number of
journalism majors have intern-
ships with major television net-
works in New York as well as
with several newspapers. Four
W&L students are spending
part of the term working with
the artist Christo on a series of
islands in Biscayne Bay near
Miami.

 

(continued from page 3)
the W&L Fulbright Scholarship
committee, he helped W&L
students to win more than 60
Fulbright grants since 1948.

In recognition of the pro-
fessor’s dedicated service to
W&L, alumnus William M.
France created in 1981 a history
scholarship in Turner’s name.
Turner was also awarded
membership in the 0O.D.K.
Honorary Fraternity and
received the Pusey and Ring-
tum Phi prizes.

Turner’s autobiography
documents not only the years of
teaching that garnered these
honors, but also his heritage
and experience. A_ colorful
storyteller by profession,
Turner gives an anecdotal ac-
count of his mothers German
immigrant family, and how her
teaching at Walnut Grove,
Minn., brought her son to Lex-
ington.

One of Turner’s most popular
course offerings here was the

history of the Old West, affec-
tionately known as ‘‘Cowboys
and Indians.’ The professor re-
quired a 30 page research
paper, but gave an annual steak
fry at Goshen Pass.

While explaining history to
W&L students and the Bible to
his Sunday School classes at the
Manly Memorial Baptist Chur-
ch, Turner published 50 articles
and twelve histories.

His thirteenth volume, “A
Straw in the Wind,’’ is
dedicated to the ladies of the
Ruth Hamric bible class whom
he instructs. This exemplifies a
concern for individuals, which
dominates the story of his life.
By choice, his autobiography
tells the reader of the friend-
ships that have shaped Chuck
Turner’s years. Perhaps in-
advertantly the rich detail of
Turner’s accounts shows him to
be more humanist than _his-
torian, more observer than
Baptist. This is the strength of
“A Straw in the Wind.”’

Patrick Ottaway ,

British archaeologist speaks

By MIKE ALLEN
Phi Staff Writer

Patrick Ottaway, British ar-
chaeologist and Field Officer
for the York Archaeological
Trust, will give three illustrated
lectures in Lexington during the
coming week.

“What’s New About Ancient
Britain”’ will be his topic at the
English Speaking Union’s
meeting on Sunday at 4 p.m. at
VMI’s Marshall Library. At this
meeting, which will be open to
the public, Ottaway will survey

dramatic archaeological
discoveries recently made in
England.

Ottaway’s two other lectures
will deal with important ar-
chaeological excavations in the
city of York. ‘“York — from the
Romans to the Tudors,”’ will be
his subject on Wednesday, April
27, at 7:30 p.m., at the Northen
Auditorium of the W&L library.
His second lecture will be on

“York — the Archaeology of a
Viking City’’ and will be given
on Thursday, April 28, at 7:30
p.m. in the Northen
Auditorium. In York, Ottaway
has examined an area of the
Roman town that existed there,
as well as a site within the
precinct of the city’s Norman
castle.

Both Lectures are sponsored
by W&L, and the Rockbridge
Chapter of the Archaeological
Society of Virginia is joint spon-
sor of the lecture on the Viking
Age in York. The lectures are
open to the public.

A graduate of Oxford, Ot-
taway has supervised the ex-
cavation of six major sites in
Winchester and York, and he
has also worked on numerous
sites in Lincoln, Southampton,
Colchester and Repton that are
related to his special interest in
the origins and development of

Koman and medieval towns in
England.

In York, Ottaway has ex-
amined an area of the Roman
town that existed there, as well
as a site within the precinct of
the city’s Norman castle.

At present Ottaway is doing
research on iron objects found
during the recent excavation in
York of Viking Age buildings.
From the Viking Age dig at
York it has been learned that
the city was the capital of an

important independent Viking
kingdom between 866 A.D. and
the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Thanks to the richness of the
finds, the York Archaeological
Trust has been able to mount a
major display illustrating the
social history of this Viking
kingdom. During the past year
this display has drawn
thousands of visitors from all
over the world.

The appointment is effective
September 1, 1983.

The Radford Professorship
was created at Washington and
Lee in 1982 as the result of a gift
from the Rupert Radford Trust,
created by the late Rupert Rad-
ford of Houston, Tex.

Sharp has been a member of
the faculty at Emory for 25
years.

“We are indeed fortunate that
Dr. Sharp will become the first
Radford Professor of Mathe-
matics,” said William J. Watt,
dean of the college at Washing-
ton and Lee. “He is highly
regarded as a teacher with a
broad range of interests. He has
been a leader in the academic
and administrative affairs at
Emory. I am confident that he
will be a splendid addition not
only to the department of
mathematics at Washington
and Lee but to the entire W&L
community.”

A native of Nashville, Tenn.,
Sharp received his bachelor’s
degree in civil engineering from
Vanderbilt in 1947. He earned
both the A.M. and Ph.D. in
mathematics from Duke Uni-
versity.

He began his teaching career
as an assistant professor at
Georgia Tech in 1953. He joined
the faculty at Emory as an
assistant professor in 1956. He
was named associate professor
in 1958 and full professor in 1967.

Sharp has served on two
separate occasions — 1960-61
and 1972-75 — as chairman of
the department of mathematics
at Emory. He has held every
elective office for which he was
eligible as a member of the col-
lege at Emory.

He is a charter member of the
Vanderbilt chapter of Tau Beta
Pi, the engineering honor socie-
ty. He held a National Science
Foundation Faculty Fellowship
for 1964-65 at the University of
Virginia and received a Na-
tional Science Foundation
Grant for Scientific Research in
1968-69. He was a participant in
an NSF Industrial Research
Participation Program at the

Lockheed-Georgia Company in
the summer of 1980.

He has served as a consultant
with the State of Georgia Gover-
nor’s Honors Program in 1980
and 1981.

He is the author of four pre-
calculus textbooks published by
Prentice-Hall, Inc., and has
written numerous articles in
scholarly journals.

Sharp and his wife, Victoria
Alexander, are the parents of
two children: Henry, currently
a student at the University of
Virginia, and Margaret, cur-
rently a student at the Universi-
ty of Colorado.

Generals outmanned by Cavaliers

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

Last Tuesday’s 22-4 shellack-
ing of William and Mary seem-
ed to be an indication that the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team would be capable of being
competitive against the Univer-
sity of Virginia.

But when the fourth-ranked
Cavaliers outscored’ the
Generals 11-3 in the second half
to roll to a 19-7 victory Sunday
on Wilson Field, new life was
given to the topic of whether it
would be logical for the pro-
gram to abandon Division I for
Division III.

Coach Jack Emmer indicated
that it is likely that the team
will not play as many strong
teams such as Maryland, North
Carolina and Syracuse, as it
now does. Over the past 10
years, W&L’s schedule has in-
cluded at least five teams that
qualified for that year’s eight-
team post season tournament.

“We will look at the strength
of our recruits and decide if we
want to continue playing the top
teams as often as we do,’”’ Em-
mer said. ‘“‘Even if we decide
not to, I think we can remain
Division I,’’ he added.

Emmer indicated that the
Generals will continue to play
Virginia every year, given the
in-state rivalry.

Remarked co-captain in John
Doub, ‘“‘I’d like to see us con-
tinue to play teams like U.Va.
High school players look at our
schedule and want to play the

tough teams we face. Eventual-
ly, though, we may have to look
at Division III if (more
academic) scholarships aren’t
given to lacrosse players.”’

In a team meeting Monday,
the discussion centered around
the outlook for the remainder of
the season, particularly Satur-
day’s game at North Carolina.

‘We've got to bounce off the
deck rather than feel sorry for
ourselves,” said Emmer. “We

have to meet the challenge. We
knew Virginia had more ability
than we did, but I assumed we
would be mentally prepared. I
didn’t think I had to fire them
up because that’s the only way
to overcome their great talent.
We didn’t rise to the occasion.
We didn’t have the right mental
attitude.”

A three-goal flurry in the last
4:44 of the second quarter
enabled the Generals (3-4) to

Baseball mired in slump

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Washington and Lee’s
baseball team lost four of its
first six games after exams to
drop to 3-5-1 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference and
4-9-1 overall.

W&L defeated Catholic
University once and tied
Maryville College. The
Generals lost to William and
Mary, Catholic, Maryville and
Lynchburg.

“I’m not too happy, but we’re
still in the thick of things,”’ said
W&L Coach Jim Murdock re-
garding his team’s position in

the ODAC race. ‘“‘We didn’t an-

ticipate being this low at this

time. The one-run-games are
hurting us,’’ he said.

“Defensively we're still very
strong. We are making very few
errors,’’ Murdock stated. ‘Our
base running has been improv-
ed too,’’ Murdock said.

' “Our shortcomings have been
our hitting and pitching,” Mur-
dock said.

W&L lost its first game after
examinations 12-2 to William
and Mary at Smith Field on
April 12.

Junior Kevin Holden and
sophomore Mike Jacoby col-
lected the only hits for the

Generals.

Senior Pat Jordan took the
pitching loss for the Generals.

Last Thursday at Catholic
University the Generals won
the first game of the double-
header 9-2, but lost the second
game 6-5 in eight innings.

Sophomore Billy White pitch-
ed a complete game three-hitter
in collecting the win in the first
game.

The Generals scored twice in
both the second and third inn-
ings and added four runs in the
fourth inning to put the game
out of reach.

close with 8-4 at halftime.

Until then, Virginia had its
way, despite some ragged ball
handling and passing. Four
unanswered goals within the
first 5:38 of the second quarter
made it 6-0, and with 6:54 left
before intermission, the lead
was 7-1.

Then, within less than a
minute, Doub rifled two long
bouncers past a screened J.B.
Meyers. Virginia’s Brian

Rogers, who finished with five
goals, and W&L’s Stu Kiehne
exchanged scores to end the
half.

The teams swapped goals
early in the second half, then
the Cavaliers took complete
control, they led by seven at the
end of the third. U.Va. emptied
their bench in the final period
but the Cavs continued to pour it
on, registering seven goals to
W&L’s two. Jeff Mason manag-
ed to beat the final buzzer for
the Generals seventh goal.

Had it not been for W&L
goalie Phil Aiken, U.Va. might
have reached 30 goals.

Aiken was sharp early on,
making five tough saves in the
game’s opening four minutes.
He denied Virginia’s crease at-
tackman, Paul French, from
point-blank range on five occa-
sions.

Rogers, however, had no such
problems. The 5-9, 175-pounder
hit off a fastbreak, took a Mike
Caravana feed in the slot, then
fired in a rebound for three
first-half. goals. Before he sat
down, Rogers connected on
another fast break and cranked
up for a bullet from deep out-
side.

Shots attempted indicate, as .
much as anything, Virginia’s
domination. Virginia had 59 to
W&L’s 31. Meyer and two other
goalies stopped only half of
W&L’s 14 shots that were on
goal.

Lynchburg College capitaliz-
ed on four three-set victories,
including all three doubles mat-
ches, to defeat W&L 6-3 in Tues-
day’s tennis action at Lynch-
burg.

In singles’ action, however,
No. 1 General, Craig Cannon,
stunningly upset Lynchburg’s
two time ODAC player-of-the
year Buzz Fry 6-3, 6-2. A ‘‘pretty
psyched’’ Cannon said ‘“‘it was
just the best match I’ve played
all year.”

“He likes to hit at the
baseline” said Cannon of Fry, a
junior t and 1961 Al Americat.

“tand I just gave him short balls
and passed him at the net,”
Cannon’s win should give him a
strong bid for the Division III
NCAA Championships Tourna-
ment held May 12-14.

In other action, No. 2 Steve
Denny defeated Max Hender-
son of Lynchburg 6-4, 6-3
to keep his bid for the National
Championships alive. Andy
Haring won the No. 4 singles 6-4,
6-4 to tie Lynchburg at 3-3
before W&L lost the doubles
matches.

The loss to Lynchburg was
the Generals sixth consecutive
match loss bringing the
season’s won/loss record to
6-12. Commenting on a winless
four match road trip to Florida
over spring break, tennis coach
Gary Franke added op-
timistically, ‘We are playing
our best tennis (of the season
now) and have lost to some good
teams.”

Four of the five defeats came
on the spring break road-trip to
Florida. W&L lost to Stetson,

Golfers host 7th
ODAC tourney

The Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Championship
Tournament returns to the Lex-
ington Country Club this Mon-
day and Tuesday, April 25-26
when Washington and Lee
entertains six teams for the
seventh annual installment of
the 36-hole event.

The Generals, who staged the
ODAC’s first golf tournament
on April 18, 1977, will welcome
Bridgewater College, Catholic
University, _Hampden-Sydney
College, Lynchburg College,
Randolph-Macon College, and
Roanoke College. Lynchburg’s
Hornets are defending cham-
pions: Roanoke’s Maroons won
in 1980 and 1981; Lynchburg in
1979, W&L in 1977 and 1978.

“It’s always been a com-
petitive tournament. No one
runs away with it each year and
I don’t see anyone doing it this
time,” offers W&L head coach
Buck Leslie. Lynchburg’s title
last spring came by one stroke
(611 to 612) over Roanoke,
which placed second by one
stroke over Washington and Lee
in the tournament’s closest
finish.

Play will begin each morning
at 8:30 on the par 71, 6,444-yard
Lexington course. Each college
will enter six golfers, from
whom the top four scores com-
prise the team’s total. The top
seven individuals will receive

Track & Field
Generals

By CHRIS FULTON
Phi Staff Writer

Spring break for the universi-
ty doesn’t mean break for the
track team — it means bearing
down again after the hiatus of
exam week. After exams the
track team resumed practice
with two-a-days.

Saturday, April 9, W&L sent
11 men with assistant coach
David Friedfield to the
Christopher Newport College
Invitational. W&L picked up
three wins and three meet
records with junior Angus
McBryde running to the win-
ner’s circle twice in the 1,500
meter and the 5,000 meter runs
and sophomore Mark Pem-
broke in the 800 meter.

McBryde ran the 1,500 in four
minutes flat, missing the school
record by a half second and set-
ting a meet record. Running the
5,000 for the first time,
McBryde slashed the school
record by 23.6 seconds and set a
meet record with a time of
15:11.7. Pembroke ran a 1:58.0
meet record time in the 800
meters.

A meet scheduled for Friday,
April 15 against Lynchburg,
Eastern Mennonite, and Rad-

weekend in the fourth annual
Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic” plus a sixth to be
decided during this week’s
practices. The five are seniors
Tim Webb and Frank English,
juniors Whit Kelly and Steve
Jones and freshman Turner
Friedman.

Webb carded a 157 to lead
W&L at the 36-hole Gobbler
Classic, which had Friday play
at the Blacksburg Country Club
and Saturday competition on
the Virginia Tech course. His
score included the team’s
lowest round, a par-72 on Fri-
day.

Friedman added a 159, Kelly
a 162, English a 164, and Jones a
165 as the Generals placed 14th
in a 16-team field. Unhindered
by rain on Friday and cold
winds on Saturday, Virginia
Tech won the event.

“Coming off W&L’s spring
break we were a bit rusty in
Blacksburg,” offered Leslie.
“‘We shot a lot of 81s and 82s
which were just a few strokes
from being good rounds. With
good practice time this week we
should be able to get lower
scores at the ODAC Champion-
ships.

W&L’s schedule this week in-
cluded dual match competition
with Bridgewater, Lynchburg,
Hampden-Sydney, and Newport
News on Tuesday at the In-
gleside Country Club in Staun-

Time Out....

By MIKE STACHURA
Assistant Sports Editor

...Much has transpired since
we chatted last. Here are some
thoughts that may make you
want to take a second look at
those events. I must first speak
of those boys from Raleigh (got
it right this time). Other than
the fact that the Pack was bless-
ed (Jim Valvano should be
canonnized for sainthood), the
reason N.C. State came back
from Albuquerque smiling was
that Houston and most impor-
tantly, Guy Lewis, were their
own worst enemies. When
Houston slowed things down
midway through the second
half, the sixth man on the floor,
‘‘Mo Mentum,”’ put on a State
jersey. It left me wondering
what the Cougars would have
done this year if they had been
able to combine their great
talent with some solid coaching
instead of subsisting the entire
year solely on the former...

..[t seems that Hershel
Walker has started to play foot-
ball again since our last
meeting. I can’t deny the man’s
phenomenal talent. What I can

point out though, is that while
he is ripping up the league, he
would be performing at least as
well in college where he would
be raising his market value:
This would prevent his hurting
the game by his hardship deci-
sion, a result whose damage is
not measureable in dollar
signs...

...Of course, there was also
the Masters. Not discounting
Senor Ballesteros’ stellar final
day performance, the close of
this year’s tourney in Augusta
was a most pitiful performance.
Going into Monday’s final round
three of the best, Watson,
Stadler, and Floyd, along with
Ballesteros all were contenders
for the green jacket. Yet when
the Spaniard started eagle-
birdie the trio of former cham-
pions died instantly. This is a
sad commentary on the game
and its participants when no one
rises to meet the challenge. The
only thing that saved The
Masters was the winner’s per-
formance. Ballesteros was a
champion while the others step-
ped out of his way...

...The Jersey Prophet
reminds me that I forgot to in-

clude his projected order of
finish in the big leagues. For
those interested, the Garden
State Guesser has it Milwaukee,
New York, Baltimore, Boston,
Detroit, and Cleveland in the
AL East; Chicago, Kansas City,
California, Oakland, Seattle,
Texas, and Minnesota in the AL
West; Montreal, Philadelphia,
St. Louis, Pittsburgh, New
York, and Chicago in the NL
East and Los Angeles, Atlanta,
San Diego, San Francisco,
Houston and Cincinnati in the
NL West. He said it, not me. The
Prince did leave me with this,
though. ‘‘The Islanders will not
repeat. Watch Chicago.”’ He
muttered something else about
the Rangers being in first place
but he’s been under some strain
lately so I sent him back to his
room and told him to take a
rest. (How’d you like your
Kingdom to be New Jersey? )

One thought before I go:
There are 57 horses still train-
ing for this year’s Kentucky
Derby. The only situation that is
equally amusing is the race for
the Democratic Presidential
nomination.

 

Baseball

(continued from page 10)
Walsh paced the Generals’ of-
fensive attack with two hits
each.

In the second game the
Generals tied the game at 5-5 in

e

laurels went to Charlie Alcorn
in the shot-put, Eric Nelson in
‘the discus and Alan Armitage in
the 110 meter high hurdles. Ar-
mitage set a new school record
on March 25 against Newport
News, posting a time of 15.6
seconds; this broke his own
record. Pembroke won the 800
meter and McBryde won the
1500 meter run.

(continued from page 10)

ing home. Including the last
home match before exams that
W&L lost 5-4 to Albany State
(SUNY), the tennis team’s win-
loss record stood at 6-11.

Before the Stetson match,
junior Jim Irwin beat
sophomore Andy Haring for the
No. 3 singles position and
freshman Scott Adams won the
No. 5 singles spot from junior
Charlie Kalocsay during intra-
squad challenge matches. Irwin
had won six matches and lost
five at No. 5 (singles) while
Haring posted a 49 match
record at No. 3. Freshman stan-
dout Adams had the most wins
(8) playing No. 6, which hap-
pened to.be twice the victories

Kalocsay had at the close of
March.

Oddly, in spite of four of six
singles positions being juggled,
Jim Irwin’s singles victory 6-1,
6-4 at Emory was the only win in
the four positions that changed.
Franke said the positions are
settled for the rest of the year
and “‘that’s where they (single’s
players) belong.”’

The double’s play won half
the matches on the road with
the No. 2 pair of Jim Irwin and
Anthony Frens capturing two
victories 7-5, 6-4 over Stetson

and 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 at Rollins. The

No. 1 doubles team of Craig and
Steve Denny, each of whom
posted a singles victory on the
trip, defeated Stetson 3-6, 6-3,

the seventh inning, but yielded
a run in the bottom of the eighth
inning.

Walsh led the Generals with
two hits and knocked in the ty-
ing run in the seventh inning to
send the game into extra inn-

ings.

Senior Marty Thomas pitched
the entire game taking the loss
for the Generals.

Last Saturday at Maryville
the Generals lost the first game
of the doubleheader 9-8 and tied
the second game 8-8.

Seniors Jody Harris and Chris
Cavalline both had two hits for
the Generals in the first game.
Walsh also had two hits and five
runs batted in.

In the second game the
Generals scored eight runs in
the second inning, but the
Generals’ pitching could not
shut down the Scots and the
game ended in a deadlock.

Murdock said that the game
will not be continued and will be
counted in the standings as a
tie.

Lynchburg College, the defen-
ding ODAC champions, jumped
on W&L for six runs in the first

 

 

 

inning and defeated the Gene-
rals 19-5 Tuesday.

Harris led the Generals offen-
sively with three hits. Golden
and Senior Jim Daly each had
two hits.

Starter Marty Thomas took
the loss for the Generals.

The Generals play a double-
header against Hampden-Syd-
ney at home on Saturday at 1
p.m. and face Emory & Henry
in a doubleheader at Smith
Field on Tuesday.

W&L travels to Eastern Men-
nonite for another doubleheader
on Monday.

“‘We’re going to have to get
supreme efforts by our players
over this stretch,’ Murdock
stated. ‘‘They have to maintain
good concentration,” he said.

Murdock noted that the seven
games in five days will put a
strain on his pitching staff.
“Our season depends on our
pitchers and there is just a little
more pressure on them now.”
said Murdock.

Murdock said that freshman
ourfielder Hugh Finkelstein will
probably be out for the rest of
the season. Finkelstein was in-
jured in the Maryville game.
