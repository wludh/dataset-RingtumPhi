Dr. John D. Wilson,
Washington and Lee’s new
president, made his first ap-
pearance before the faculty and
students Wednesday afternoon
at a combination celebration of
Founders’ Day and induction
ceremony for Omicron Delta
Kappa, a national honorary
leadership society.

Calling Washington and Lee
‘‘a unique institution, honored
in the world for its fidelity to
high standards,’ Wilson told
the standing room only au-
dience of students and sup-
porters, ‘‘I believe deeply in the
possibility of progress, and
moreover, I think it is an essen-
tial...underpinning of the work
of a serious educational institu-
tion.”

Wilson, who officially became
president at 8:28 a.m. Monday,

a Wilson takes office

succeeds Robert E.R. Huntley,
president since 1968. Huntley
will now return to the faculty of
Washington and Lee’s Law
School.

At Wednesday’s assembly,
Huntley said it was ‘‘a special
delight” to introduce Wilson,
‘“‘not just because it spells
relief, not even mainly for that
reason.”

In Wilson’s previous positions
as provost at Virginia Tech and
earlier as president of Wells
College, Huntley said Wilson
had been ‘‘justly praised by
faculty and students as ex-
emplary in every way.”

Huntley said that having
Wilson as his successor is ‘“‘the
latest proof that our guardian
angel is still on duty.” He said,
‘Washington and Lee and John
Wilson are right for each
other.”’

In turn, Wilson, 51, said, ‘“‘Bob

Transition running smoothly

By ART BELL
Special to the Phi

Former Washington and Lee
University President Robert
E.R. Huntley and President
John D. Wilson both experienc-
ed inauspicious, yet humorous
endings to the four-and-a-half
month long transition period
that ended last weekend.

Huntley spent his last hours
as president Friday afternoon

worrying about a sudden break-
down of the payroll program in
the university’s computer
system. Then, over the weekend
the univeristy’s telephone
system also broke down, coupl-
ed with a loss of power to the
lights in the main collonade
building.

Wilson, before starting out on
his usual pre-breakfast jog
Monday morning, accidently
locked himself out of the Lee

House after moving in over the
weekend. Wilson still managed,
however, to reach his office on
time that morning to be sworn

in as W&L’s 21st president.

Frank A. Parsons, who has
served as Assistant to the Presi-
dent since 1959 coordinated the
transition phase after the board
of trustees announced its selec-
tion of Wilson to succeed
Huntley as president back in
September.

The initial problem con-
fronted in the transition, Par-
sons said, was in trying to time
the release to the news media of
Wilson’s selection with the ac-
tual election by the board of
trustees. Major newspapers
around the state had learned
that Wilson was the top choice
of the executive committee of
the board of trustees as much as
a week before the board’s ac-

stitution his entire professional
career to date, virtually his en-
tire adult life, and he promises
still much more.”’

“‘He has added to its strength
and promise and its prosperi-
ty,”’ Wilson said.

Saying that Washington and
Lee is ‘‘prosperous in every-
thing that truly matters,”
Wilson said it has “‘a first-rate
faculty of scholars and
teachers, a highly selected com-
munity of first-rate students
drawn from a large national
pool, a stunningly attractive
campus that is both graceful
and functional, and a devoted
and generous family of alumni
and freinds.”’

Wilson said Washington and
Lee has a reputation ‘‘for its un-
wavering confidence in the ef-
ficacy of the educated mind, for
its faith in the power of the ra-
tional life.”’

Progress was the theme of his
address, and the new president
asserted that ‘‘progress sur-
vives here, must survive here, I
submit.”

Although Wednesday was the
day for “‘formal celebration’”’ of
the school’s founding fathers,
Wilson told students: ‘‘Let us
try, for a moment or two, every
day, to give thanks to those
whose gift of this place we en-
joy.

“We can do this in large and
small ways to be sure. But the
most signifigant and lasting
way is for all of us to commit
ourselves to leave our part of

Soviet diplomat calls for peace , cooperation

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Staff Writer

Framed by portraits of
Generals Washington and Lee,
Soviet diplomat Yevgeniy V.
Afanasyev called for ‘‘increas-
ed cooperation’ between his
country and the United States
Monday night.

Afanasyev, second secretary
of the Soviet Embassy in Wash-
ington, told a Lee Chapel au-
dience that we are undergoing
“a very important period in
Soviet-American _ relations
because from the start of the
detente process we have moved
to a more dangerous state
where we are seeing more and
more arms on both sides.

“The state of our relations is
not good,” Afanasyev added.
“We are probably at a low
point.”

Echoing the traditional Soviet
party line, the diplomat called
for a ‘peaceful coexistance”’

between the two superpowers.
Also, Afanasyev, who has been

in the United States since 1976,
said, ‘We don’t believe that
there can be a limited nuclear
war.”

“There is no more important
task at this time than to
preserve peace,’’ he said.

The Soviet Union has “an

abundance” of natural gas,
which Western Europe needed,
noted Afanasyev. Therefore, a
pipeline to channel this natural
gas was constructed, and the
Soviets received some benefits
in the form of technology. ‘‘It
was a mutually beneficial
thing,” said the envoy. ‘‘It had
nothing to do with pure politics.
It was business.”

Afanasyev feels that both the
United States and the Soviet
Union would benefit from har-
monious trade relations rather
than economic sanctions. He
claimed that the USSR is ahead

of the United States in some

areas of space exploration and
nuclear fusion. However, he
said, “The most ~ important
theory of our relations is in the
areas of disarmament and
preventing world war.

Although the United States
has more missiles based on sub-
marines and more bombers
than the Soviet Union, the lat-
ter’s edge in land-based
missiles creates a parity that
Afanasyev said was confirmed
by leaders of both nations in
1979.

Therefore, both nations
should ‘‘accept the parity and
accept the principle of equal
security for both sides. We must
limit or freeze the current
levels of strategic arms and
then go down.”’

Because new arms are expen-
sive and difficult to control, the
ambassador said, ‘‘It is more
important to reach some agree-

ments now to limit the nuclear
arms race.”

‘‘We can answer to any major
weapons produced by the
United States. If the United
States deploys the MX Missiles,
we will deploy our own missiles.
Or if the United States will
deploy the cruise missiles, we
can do the same. But we don’t
think this is the right way to go.
We think we should stop this
and go down,” Afanasyev said.

“The United States and the
Soviet Union have their own

problems,” he added. ‘‘We fee)
that it would be only beneficial
to concentrate on these pro-
blems instead of the arms
race.”

On other topics, Afanasyev
said there was ‘‘no big change”
between the policies of Yuri An-
dropov and those of his

predecessor, Leonid Brezhnev.

“There is more continuity in the
foreign policy of the Soviet

Union than the United States,”’
according to the diplomat. He
indicated that Soviet negotia-
tors often have difficulties
because they are forced to deal

with: a. new American ad-

ministration every four years.
Expressing the Soviet posi-

tion on Afghanistan, Afanasyev

claimed that the Soviet pre-
sence in the war-torn country
was to eliminate the foreign
threat to the revolutionary
government. ‘‘There should be
no foreign interference in the in-
ternal affairs of Afghanistan,”’
he said.

On the recent events in
Poland, the Soviet diplomat
said, ‘“‘The people in Poland
want to enjoy a better economic
life — they are tired of Solidari-
ty. They want to lead a more
normal life.”’

Editorial

Martin Luther King once banned at W&L

By BILL ROBERTS
Editor-in-Chief

The birthday of the Rev. Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. passed
quietly on the Washington and
Lee campus Saturday.

King was murdered in Mem-
phis 15 years ago. Blacks in this
country remember him as the

Tuesday in the Pit?

Dear Editor:

The question has arisen con-
cerning the scheduling of bands
by the SAB and UCC on week-
nights instead of weekends. Mr.
Whitehead in a previous letter
to the Phi suggests that
Tuesdays in the Cockpit be
moved to a time of the weeh
where a smaller number of con-
flicts exist, preferably on Fri-
day. Several reasons exist for
not already undertaking such a
move.

When booking entertainment
one quickly learns that bands
demand and usually receive
higher prices for weekend
engagements (Friday and
Saturday nights). By featuring
entertainment on a weeknight a
savings of $300 to $500 is realiz-
ed per engagement on band
prices. This allows the UCC to
bring in more entertainment
with the student body funds
given to the committee by the
student government. If
‘“‘Tuesdays’’ is moved to the
weekend, the number of bands
booked would have to be curtail-
ed somewhat, bringing less
entertainment to the campus
for the same amount of money.

Another reason for placing
bands in the Cockpit on week-
nights concerns their availabili-
ty. If we ran our program on the
weekend, the UCC would be
competing against many other
groups for entertainment. Local
bars, fraternities, surrounding
girls’ schools and other colleges
in the area are also looking for
bands on Friday nights. Not on-
ly would we be paying a higher

greatest civil rights activist
that ever lived, a legendary
man whose dreams of racial
equality still inspire the minds
of free men.

There was a time 21 years
ago, when King’s revolutionary
ideas were the source of ex-
treme controversy on this cam-
pus. In Oct. 1961, the Washing-

price, but the choices of enter-
tainment would be curtailed
due to greater demand brought
on by these groups on week-
ends. Weeknights bring more
flexibility in band choice, allow-
ing the selection of higher quali-
ty bands.

The present arrangement in
the Cockpit was launched last
year with the consideration of
avoiding conflicts. Mr. White-
head claims that Friday would
be a more ideal day in order to
accomplish this goal. However,
an equally strong case can be
made for continuing the pro-
gram in its present form. Many
independents view ‘‘Tuesdays”’
as a way to break up the week,
for they do not participate in
Wednesday night parties. Girls’
schools schedule the majority of
their activities on weekends
causing further conflict with
moving the program. Also, by
having bands appear on
weeknights, students at W&L
are given an additional night to
interact with girls from the sur-
rounding schools, an aspect
crucial to an all male environ-
ment.

“Tuesdays” is not trying to
compete with the academics at
W&L but attempts to offer an
additional alternative for the
students to enjoy. The UCC
under Brett Kass has put
together a good schedule for the
winter and the present arrange-
ment will continue. We hope to
see you in the Cockpit during
the upcoming winter months.

ton and Lee Board of Trustees
denied a request by a student
organization for permission to
invite King to speak here.

On Oct. 20, the Ring-tum Phi
reported the Board’s action on
the front page. ‘Washington
and Lee’s Board of Trustees has
refused to grant the University
Christian Association permis-
sion to invite the Reverand Doc-
tor Martin Luther King Jr. to
this campus,” wrote Tom
Lybass, a Phi staff reporter.

‘‘No reason was given by the
Board for declining the UCA re-
quest. :

‘Earlier this month, the stu-
dent Executive Committee of
the UCA voted, subject to the
approval of the Faculty Com-
mittee on Christian Work, to in-
vite the controversial Negro
minister to lead a UCA seminar
on ‘Christian Ethics and Non-
Violent Protest in Race Rela-
tions.’

“The faculty committee
discussed the issue last week

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi EC Correspondent

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to prohibit
the sale of Fancy Dress related
items in the Student Center, the
Dining Hall, and around the
Supply Store, except by Student
Activities Board represen-
tatives.

Vice president Morgan Grif-
fith commented that ‘‘the mo-
tion doesn’t prevent someone
from getting out and hustling.”
The SAB wants money made on
FD to go back to the students
rather than into someone’s
pocket, according to SAB chair-
man Lanier Edge.

Critic
‘The Mink’

Dear Editor:

“The Mink’? was a master-
piece of retrograde name-
calling. Even its author lacked
the conviction to have his name
printed! I cannot fathom that
his peers view the intracampus
conflict as one resulting from
the presence of women in the
law school. Your publication of
this anonymous manifesto only
escalates any conflict and
serves no purpose in lessening
the gulf between the hill and
Lewis Hall.

You should discuss profes-
sionalism and responsibility in
editorial policy with your facul-
ty advisor. Then print an
apology.

and voted to recommend to
President Cole and the Board of
Trustees that the student group
be allowed to invite Dr. King to

lead the seminar,’’ Lybass
reported.
The Trustees of this universi-

ty not only prohibited the
students and faculty from in-
viting King to speak, but they
also declared the issue closed.
They would not discuss it and
were unresponsive to powerful
arguments by the students and
faculty for a reversal of the
denial.

In an Oct. 24 editorial, the Phi
editors demonstrated the incon-
sistency of the Trustees’
behavior.

“In refusing the University
Christian Association’s request
to have Dr. Martin Luther King
speak, the Board of Trustees
has violated two fundamental
principles of this school.

“The Washington and Lee

aspirations of the University,

Senior representative John
Vlahoplus was opposed to the
motion. ‘‘I’d like to make a
stand for free enterprise...If a
guy can make a good T-shirt
and sell it himself...he ought to
be allowed to do it,” Vlahoplus

argued.

Junior representative Scott
Mason said that he would like to
see a moratorium placed on the
sale of non-SAB FD items for
the whole campus. No action
was taken on this suggestion,
and the motion was put to a
vote. The motion passed 9-3,
with Vlahoplus, freshman rep-

states: ‘This University, sub-
ject to no type of political con-
trol whatever, is none the less
dedicated to the democratic
form of social organization; to
the ancient freedoms and par-
ticularly to the liberty of the
mind with its attendant right of
inquiry.’ The catalogue con-
tinues, ‘The other enduring
adherence of this University is
declared in the first by-law of
its official regulations, first in
importance, as well as in time,
which affirms that while sec-
tarian domination of this school
is prohibited, the obligation to
inculcate the Christian ideal is
hereby acknowledged.’

“If the Board had adhered to
the ‘principles’ of the Universi-
ty, Dr. Martin Luther King
would be allowed to appear and
speak on this campus. instead,
the request to have him lead a
seminar sponsored by the UCA
has been denied without
reason.”

than it was when first we came
toit.”

Wilson, who will be officially
inaugurated in May, moved into
Lexington this weekend. In his
address, he praised the ‘‘Magic
of this lovely community with
its visually stunning university
on the ridge line.”’

Following his speech, Wilson
said that he has ‘“‘set out to meet
this community in the most
systematic way I can.” He said
he will begin by meeting with
seniors in small groups, and
will “have individual meetings
with the faculty in their offices
over the next few months.”

Wilson also hopes to meet
students at tonight’s basketball
game with Roanoke. He went to
an earlier game and said he was
“very pleased by what I saw.
They’re a hustling group.”’

Wilson said he has ‘‘no im-
mediate plans for augmenting
or changing’ the administra-
tive staff. He praised the cur-
rent staff, and he was “gratified
that we have that strength in
place.”

Expressing ‘“‘absolute con-
fidence” in Frank Parsons, the
assistant to the president,

 

Wilson said that he had asked
Parsons to stay on.

tion marked the birthday of

Oct. 1870.

Washington and Lee University President John D. Wilson made it official Monday morning when he
signed the oath of office as James W. Whitehead, secretary of the board of trustees at W&L, watched.
Wilson signed his name to the journal which dates back to 1897 and includes the signatures of all the
university’s presidents and trustees who have taken office since that time. Ironically, the first W&L
president to sign the journal that is currently being used was also a Wilson — William L. Wilson, who
succeeded Gen. Robert E. Lee’s son, George Washington Custis Lee, and was president from 1897 to

1900. (Hinely photo)

tual election was held, making
the election a mere technicali-

Afterward, the transition in-
volved frequent trips by Wilson
to W&L from Blacksburg,
where he served as provost at
the Virginia Polytechnic In-
stitute since 1975, to meet with
university faculty members
and administrators on the many
facets of his new job.

“The size and character of
the schools are very different,”
said Parsons in comparing Vir-
ginia Tech with W&L. ‘‘He has
to learn how W&L works. A
private institution is vastly dif-
ferent from a public institu-
tion.”’

Parsons said that - Wilson,

widely regarded both as a
scholar and an administrator,
brings a fresh and healthy view-
point to his job that ‘will iden-
tify areas that need attention’
in the university, and help in
seeing new problems.

‘‘His experience is his biggest
asset,’”’ said Parsons, citing as
one of the goals of the transi-
tion Wilson’s finding ways as an
administrator to bring the
faculty and students together
‘tin the most beneficial way
possible.”’

Wilson also put renovation of
the second floor of Washington
Hall into the works during the
last few months, specifically
focusing on the addition of a
conference room and the reno-
vation of the president’s office.
Despite the flourish of construc-
tion and renovation of the W&L

campus during the Huntley ad-
ministration, Washington Hall
was left untouched.

‘‘Huntley took care of
everybody except himself,”
Parsons added, referring to
Huntley’s office and the rest of
the second floor.

Parsons said the renovation is
tentatively slated to begin this
summer,

The transition proved especi-
ally nostalgic, according to Par-
sons, because leaving with
Huntley is his secretary, Alber-
tina Ravenhorst, who first
came to W&L in 1943 and has
served as secretary for fou
W&L presidents. Though of-
ficially retired, she reportedly
will still work with Huntley in
his position at the W&L Law
School.

‘CHARLENE, THE FEDERAL TEENAGE CONTRACEPTIVE POLICE
CONTROL — NOT THAT AWFUL

(continued from page 1)

The logic of the editorial was
undeniable. The Trustees had
acted arbitrarily with absolute-
ly no regard for the basic tenets
of this University. They had
been entrusted with fostering
the liberal education at
Washington and Lee and they
flagrantly violated that trust.

On Oct. 27, the Phi reported,
“Student opinion at Washington
and Lee solidified against the
action of the University Board
of Trustees during the past
week as an atmosphere of in-
dignation spread and
strengthened.

“A Ring-tum Phi poll in-
dicated that the student body
resented the Board’s decision to
withhold approval from Martin
Luther King as a campus
speaker with nearly complete
unanimity.

“‘Of students questioned, only
one was able to agree with the
Board’s decree; but the student
was not reconciled to the
Board’s failure to explain its
decision to the University.

“General feeling seemed to
run most strongly over the fact
that the decision was apparent-
ly an arbitrary one and was
handed down to the school
without justification.’’

One student was quoted in the
article as saying, ‘‘They have
no reason as far as I can see in
banning Martin Luther King.
There is no reason why the man
shouldn’t speak here, absolute-
ly none.”’

“I myself am a_ segrega-
tionist, but I see no reason why
the University shouldn’t hear
his argument,’ the student
said.

DERO-PROVERA

Washington and Lee was an
all-white school in 1961 when
this controversy arose. In those
days the administration had
some control over the activities
of students. The Assistant Dean
of Students was able to prohibit
all fraternities and_ social
organizations from having the
“Hot Nuts’ combo perform
anywhere, on or off campus.

But the conflict over King was
not between the faculty and the
students, or the administration
and the students.

The conflict was between the
entire school and a small group
of Trustees.

On Nov. 6, the faculty met for
more than two hours and ap-
proved a resolution concerning
King and the Trustees.

“The faculty action on Martin
Luther King was their first to be
taken since the proposal to in-
vite King to the campus for a
seminar in religion was re-
jected by the Board of Trus-
tees,’’ the Phi reported on Nov.
7.

“This decision, in the opinion
of the faculty, seriously limits
the freedom of inquiry, that
should prevail in an institution
of higher learning, and denies to
the students the opportunity to
learn for themselves, even upon
issues of controversy,” the
faculty statement said.

The faculty resolution was
mailed to each of the Trustees.
By that time however, the stu-
dent Executive Committee had
already sent letters to the
Trustees requesting a reversal
of the ban on King’s ap-
pearance. The EC letter said,
“Although concerned with im-
mediate problem of refusing to
allow the Rev. King to be in-

vited to speak, we feel that the
issues presented here have a
broader implication.

“Such restrictions upon
academic freedom are both
damaging to the general repu-
tation of the University and
more defintely to the morale of
the students in attendence.”’

The EC letter applied the
same argument as the Phi
editorial based on principles of
the University stated in the
catalogue.

The Trustees remained in-
transigent in the face of the
school’s reaction. Meanwhile
the scandal made _ news
throughout the state of Virginia.
Editorials in three Virginia
newspapers lauded the facul-
ty’s stance.

The Roanoke Times wrote on
Nov. 23, ‘‘The teachers deserve
applause for their boldness and
loyalty to one of the deepest
obligations of their professions;
defense of the right to know. In
going on the record in this
fashion they have redeemed the
university from an unfortunate
impression created by the
board.” .

Washington and Lee
celebrated Founders’ Day
Wednesday with great pomp
and ceremony. General Robert
E. Lee’s birthday always brings
forth profound statements of
the great traditions of this
university.

There can be no doubt that the
educational opportunity offered
at Washington and Lee is of the
highest calibre, but when we
proclaim this to ourselves, we
should remember that tradition
has been discarded in the past.

General Lee was the an-
tithesis of Dr. King. Freedom of
intellectual inquiry and the in-
dependence of the mind are
fragile rights which will always
need protection. To that end, we
should remember Martin
Luther King and honor the
ideals for which he fought.

Void Biscuits and the

By Allen Roberts
Phi Staff Writer

The air was electrified with
expectation in Droid’s of Lex-
ington that night. Yes, he was
already in town. The champ’s
limo had been sighted speeding
past Hop-In, coated with dust
accumulated on his whirlwind
tour of the East Coast. His
‘agents had managed to sched-
ule a stop in Big Lex, his
hometown, between major ap-
pearances in Times Square,
Georgetown, Virginia Beach,
Myrtle Beach.

All the local whiz-kids were
clustered about the screens,
their excited whispers hushed
by the mocking voices of the
machines. He’s here, he’s here!

shrieked the girl bearing Big
Quarters to a drunken trio at
the end-table. The-champ seem-
ed to glide through the front
door, his silk robe glistening in
the lamplight. The fawning
crowd nervously stumbled back

as he approached the game °

room. His trainer hurriedly
massaged his arms; gently
loosened the joints of his legen-
dary fingers and carefully
sprayed silicone on his elbows
and fingertips. ‘Ya ready,
Ace?” asked the trainer. ‘‘Jake,
I’m always ready,” the champ
replied, doffing his infra-red
goggles.

The ace approached Ms. Pac-
Man first, chanting slowly,
“Ener, Ener, energize me...no,
no, no, never eat me Blinky,
Pinky, Inky and Sue...I’m gon-

=

 

na bite you, swallow you and
spit you out...ener, ener,
energize me.’’ He slowly lifted a
gold quarter from the velvet-
lined traveling case, inserted it
and...and then the slaughter
began. It was horrible and it
was beautiful. His hand was
ungodly quick on the stick,
and one by one they fell —
—cherry, strawberry, orange,
pretzel, apple, pear, banana
and the hapless, helpless baby.
The anxious fans peered over
his limber shoulders in awe, as
the score multiplied in a flurry
of digits.

An hour passed, and then
another, as Jake gently wiped
the champ’s furrowed, sweaty
brow. “C’mon Ace, let up.
You’ve already turned it over
six times,”’ the trainer pleaded.

 

 

The champ conceded, and of-
fered his last twelve turns to an
eager fan.

He turned to Defender. Dis-
daining the smart bomb, Ace
warped through innumerable
quadrants as mutant after mu-
tant evaporated under his stac-
cato fire. All night the champ’s
hands graced the buttons at
Droid’s and the games suffered
ignominious defeat. Zaxxon,
Qixand Phoenix; Robotron,
Donkey Kong and Dig Dug
—none could withstand his
relentless assault. The Gravitar
unit exploded as his 20th ship
entered deep space. Centipede
was reduced to caterpillar
status, and saucers shied away
from the Asteroids screen.
Even Tempest was lulled to a

 

Ace

breeze by his fearsome mastery
of the super zapper.

Yes, Ace was-king that night
in his old haunt. As he made his
way out of the game room; un-
daunted by the smoke and
debris, a child protege tugged
at his glowing sleeve. The boy
looked up with adoring eyes,
and offered a pair of sausage
biscuits. ‘‘Hey, thanks kid,” the
champ replied, accepting his
tithe.

As Ace stepped into the cold
mountain dawn, he turned back
to face the boy, who was staring
into the flashing ‘‘Insert Coin’’
message on the Pac-Man
screen. ‘‘Hey, Kid!’’ he called.
The champion smiled faintly
and flipped a golden quarter
toward his disciple.

Oldtime radio on WLUR

‘“‘Who knows what evil lurks
in the hearts of men?”’

Chuck Diffenderffer knows.
Well, maybe Diffenderffer
doesn’t know about the evil in
men’s hearts. But he does know
all about ‘‘The Shadow,”’
(a.k.a., Lamont Cranston, who
made that question famous),
not to mention “The Green
Hornet,’’ ‘‘The Great
Gildersleeve,”’ ‘“‘Fibber McGee
and Molly,” and ‘“‘The Bicker-
sons,’’ toname just a few.

In case you haven’t guessed,
Diffenderffer is an aficionado of
oldtime radio. Collecting re-
cordings of old radio: programs
may not seem such an unusual
hobby until you consider that
Diffenderffer, a Washington
and Lee University freshman
from Baldwin, Md., was not
even born when ‘‘The Shadow”’
solved his last mystery.

But Diffenderffer has been
making up for lost time. During

the past. two years, he has col- -

lected 100 hours of oldtime radio
programs and done a good bit of
research into his new hobby.

And each Sunday night from 9
p.m. to 9:30 p.m., he shares his
interest and his expertise over
WLUR-FM_ 91.5, Washington
and Lee’s campus radio station.

‘“‘We had obtained a good col-
lection of old radio shows for the
station. But until Chuck came,
no one had the interest or the
knowledge to play them on the
air,’’ explained Robert J.
deMaria, assistant professor of
journalism and_ general
manager of WLUR.

Diffenderffer was happy to
oblige and has made good use of
the station’s collection.

“TI had always heard my
grandfather talk about old radio
programs and how the radio
forced you to use your imagina-
tion,’’ Diffenderffer said. ‘‘One
night I happened to pick up
‘CBS Mystery Theatre’ on the
car radio. I became engrossed
in the story and discovered that
my grandfather was right.”

Diffenderffer’s personal col-
lection includes many old stand-
bys—episodes of ‘‘The Shadow”

and “The Green Hornet’’ and
“Gunsmoke” along with such
single programs as the classic
“‘War of the Worlds.’’ One of his
most prized possessions is a
tape of the final rehearsal of a
“Mercury Theatre’ episode.

For his weekly WLUR pro-
gram, Diffenderffer does con-
siderable background research
which he uses to introduce the
episode.

“TI have done quite a lot of
reading into the history of radio
drama. And I’ve also learned a
great deal simply by talking
with my grandparents about
it,’ says Diffenderffer, who
plans to major in_ political
science at W&L.

“Ever since I began to be in-
terested in oldtime radio, I have
found television very, very
boring—even though I still
watch TV. The difference is that
listening to radio is more like

studying: you can’t let your at-
tention wander at all. You real-
ly have to listen. I consider
listening to a radio program as
taking my imagination for a
walk.”

Diffenderffer confesses that
his fellow students have a dif-
ficult time understanding his in-
terest in the old radio shows.

“I would say that the collec-

tion of records I have in my
dorm room is rather different

from the collection you would
find in most college dorm
rooms,” he added.

The oldtime radio program is
part of a Sunday schedule on
WLUR that includes a two-hour
show of Christian rock from
7:30 to 9:30 a.m., ‘“‘Two on the
Aisle,’’ a broadway and
showtune program from noon to
2p.m., and an oldies but goodies
program from 9:30 p.m. to mid-

night.

Opinion

ERA revived

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Phi Staff Writer
House Resolution - Judicial-1
(HRJ-1.)

There’s something _ intrin-
sically ominous about the sound
of that, and that’s odd, consider-
ing it’s only the. Equal Rights
Amendment resurrected from
last year’s disappointing
defeat.

What strikes me the most
about HRJ-1, however, is more
than its placement as_ the
number-one piece of legislation
for House consideration. In an
age when unemployment rivals
the heights of joblessness dur-
ing the Great Depression,
where food, clothing and hous-
ing no longer are common com-
modities, where nuclear arms
and nuclear catastrophe preoc-
cupy the minds of even the
jobless, we place as our highest
priority for Congress as 23 word
phrase ‘guaranteeing equali-
ty” on account of sex.

The emphasis on rights in an
age of despair seems out of
place. When the amendment
was first introduced in 1972 and
passed Congress overwhelm-
ingly, American society then
had less pressing demands than
it does today. Equality and
women’s rights and Watergate
were the events of the day, not
Social Security bankruptcy,
small business failure, and
social program budget cuts.
The time was right, the votes
were there, and Congress acted.
But America was not yet ready
for the change.

Today, the time is not right
once more. The votes may be
there, but so is Phyllis Schlafly.
Congress will act and _ un-
doubtedly pass HRJ-1, but it
will not be its number one
priority. And there is hwere the
ERA will fail once more. The
ERA is too serious a step to be
taken so lightly. Granted,
Eleanor Smeal may reappear,
Betty Ford will hit the circuit,

and legislatures will be lobbied.
But the preoccupation of legis-
latures will be the economy,
and not the ERA.

In the rush to get the economy
started again, people eating
again, and a new lead story for
the evening news, I fear an
economically-weakened society
may be duped into taking a
placebo that it will discover to
be upsetting. In a time of agony
and distress, men act out of
desperation, out of a will to sur-
vive. We have not reached the
stage where we need embrace
the ERA out of desperation.

I’m not denying htexE the
ERA could help our society
(and like any constitutional
amendment taken too. far
—Remember Prohibition? Most
people don’t. It could hurt). But
do we dare allow ourselves to be
tempted in such trying times
with such an emotional issue? I
fear that we may falsely label
the ERA an economic egali-
tarian gain and deceive
ourselves.

Let’s not fool ourselves. The
ERA is for equality, not the
economy. Labeling it any other
way is a gross misinterpreta-
tion. Ardent feminists, to show
an act of patriotism, might
benefit most in the long run by
bowing gracefully (no offense! )
out of the ERA race now, focus-
ing their efforts on the role of
women in economic recovery.
Society, with its ‘‘recent-
history’’ oriented memory,
might easily forget the Schlatiy
era and its half-truths when
feminists, pointing to their con-
tributions toward reestab-
lishing the economy, later seek
votes, when men and women
can act reasonably and ra-
tionally without the fear of next
month’s Social Security or next
week’s unemployment checks
bouncing, ERA can pass.

Then, and perhaps only then,
would the ERA really win and
work.

 

Cente

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

By the time Washington and
Lee students return to campus
next fall, Central Telephone will
have completed a $3.5 million
project that will improve and
expand service for its Rock-
bridge County customers.
William Camden, Centel’s Lex-
ington customer services
manager, said the entire under-
taking is expected to be com-
pleted by July 17.

The project includes the in-
stallation of a computerized
call-switching system in Lex-
ington, the addition of new

to improve service

transmission facilities between
Lexington and Buena Vista, and
the linking of Lexington with
Roanoke by a long distance
cable system which uses laser
light to transmit calls.

Camden said installation of
the switching mechanism
began Jan. 4 at the Lexington
office, where the company is
spending $80,000 to upgrade

electrical and grounding
systems.

According to Camden, this
part of the project is

“proceeding satisfactorily.”’
Camden pointed out that the
switching system will handle
calls quietly.

‘“‘When the caller is through
dialing, there won’t be any

switching noises in the
background like we’re used to,”’
he said.

New transmission systems

‘will also be added between

Centel’s Lexington and Buena
Vista offices, at a cost of about
$82,000. Camden said they will
improve transmission quality
on calls between the two areas.
The final improvement will
be provided by a new 16-mile
lightwave cable system that
will carry calls between
Roanoke and Lexington. The
system is being built in conjuc-
tion with the Chesapeake and

Potomac Telephone Company,
which is installing about 34
miles of cable between Roanoke
and Centel’s Rockbridge Coun-
ty exchange boundary.

Concerning the cost of the en-
tire project to Centel custom-
ers, Camden said, ‘‘Bills even-
tually will be going up, but not
directly because of these im-
provements.

The new switching system
will also make it possible for all
Centel customers, including
W&L students, to buy several
features:

¢ Call waiting, which lets a

person already on the phone
know when somebody is trying
to call.

¢ Call forwarding, which
allows you to automatically
transfer your incoming calls to
other telephones when you're
away from your residence.

e Three-way calling, which
allows an extra person to be
part of a conversation.

¢ Speed calling, which allows

.you to reach up to 30 local or

long distance numbers by dial-
ing only one or two numbers.

Camden said he does not
know at the present time what
the monthly charges for these
four features will be,

Report From Rikkyo

 

Exchange Student Adjusts to New Surroundings

ticle is reprinted from the Rikkyo
University newspaper in Japan. It
is an interview with Washington
and Lee exchange student Robert
Crawford.)

Rikkyo University now has 17
exchange students from
abroad. What do they think of
Rikkyo University and Rikkyo
students, and of Japan? We in-
terviewed one student from
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, Mr. Robert Crawford.

He is a senior majoring in
Japanese and Chinese History.
He is now living in Urawa City.

He is very interested in Japan
and Japanese history because
he thinks Japan is the only
country in the world that has
been changed from a poor coun-
try into a rich one by the force
of government twice, in the
Meiji era and after World War
II. He had some good feelings
toward Japan before coming

For the fourth consecutive
year, the Foundation for
American-Chinese Cultural Ex-
changes (FACCE) is proud to
announce that the Shanghai
Chinese Language Programs
(SCLP) will be offered again at
East China Normal University
in Shanghai, China during the
summer of 1983. SCLP offers
two intensive study programs,
both of which are open to under-
graduates, graduate students
and professionals:

Language and Culture; An in-
tensive eight-week program for
students with or without prior
training in Chinese (courses are

here. Now it seems to him that
there is a great gap between
what he regarded as Japan and
what she really is. He had ex-
pected to see old buildings, peo-
ple in ‘kimonos,’ and streetcars
that appeared in typical pic-
tures of Japan in the Meiji era.
But, when he came here to
Japan, he found that almost
everything was new and
modern just like in New York or
Chicago. He was somewhat
disappointed, especially with
people dressed in western
clothes, not in ‘kimonos.’

He now has six classes at the

‘University: Japanology, poli-

tics, Japanese literature and 3
Japanese language classes, the
seminars of which are good
because they are of the right
size for lively discussions. On
the other hand, some lectures
are not so good because so
many students are packed into
a big lecture hall, never asking

at the ECNU). Past par-
ticipants have received
language credit for this pro-
gram at more than forty col-
leges and universities through-
out the U.S.

Law/Trade and Language;
An eight-week program design-
ed particularly for pre-law and
law students and professionals
in the legal field. Participants
study Chinese law, trade and
business with legal scholars, at-
torneys, and trade officials.

Both programs include room
and board on the East China
Normal University campus,

questions of the professor, who
is standing in front of the class.
And students in everyday life in
Japanese Universities are
group-oriented, taking part in
clubs and seminars. Whether a
student belongs to a club or not
is a very important matter. But
in America it isn’t. Although
Rikkyo University is very
liberal and students are per-
sonally open and friendly, once
students belong to a group, per-
sonal friendships seem to disap-
pear. So he sometimes feels it is
hard to make friends with
students in a group.

By the way, it seems to him
that language is a barrier for
him to communicate with peo-
ple, because he can’t speak
Japanese fluently and there are
very few students who can con-
verse comfortably in English.
So he can only have superficial
conversations with them, not a
profound discussion. And why

do Rikkyo students always
speak to him in English? Partly
because we, Japanese, have too
much of an inferiority complex
about our own language. We
should make much of our own
language and speak it with con-
fidence. At any rate, he comes
here to study Japan and
Japanese and naturally wants
to master Japanese.

The purpose of his stay in
Japanis not only to study, but to
learn many things from his dai-
ly experiences. For instance, he
belongs to the Kendo club at
Rikkyo University. He doesn’t
understand Kendo well but it is
very fascinating and, what’s
more, it’s much less westerniz-
ed than the other clubs. Mem-
bers of the club bow in the tradi-
tional style to their Senpai
(their seniors) and the Kohai
(their juniors) are true to the
Japanese character, he thinks.

By the way, he likes Japanese
girls very much because they
are cute and open to him. His
favorite Japanese singer is Iyo
Matsumoto. She came to Rik-
kyo University on Oct. 23. He
surely enjoyed her concert a lot.

After he goes back to Ameri-
ca, he is planning to go to
graduate school and wants to
teach Japanese history in the
future He thinks that people will
pay much more attention to
Asia in the future than to the
United States or Russia. At that
time his one year’s experience
in Japan will do him a world of
good.

Finally, we need to have a
better understanding of ex-
change students from abroad,
so the Rikkyo student exchange
system serves for greater
mutual understandings _ be-
tween countries as well as
among the people that live
there.

Reviews:

Billy Joel’s best yet
Ozzy still the same

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Phi Entertainment Writer

Billy Joel’s new album, ‘‘The
Nylon Curtain,” is perhaps his
finest moment, both musically
and lyrically. Nothing at all like
its single, ‘Pressure,’ this
album is a sensitive and in-
sightful look at the common
man’s plight.

“Allentown” is a scathing
assessment of the current
economic situation and beauti-
fully voices the unemployed’s
rage against their situation.
Joel also attacks the education
system, saying ‘‘So the gradua-
tions hang on the wall/ but they
never really helped us at all/
no, they never taught us what
was real.’’ Musically soothing
but lyrically stinging, ‘‘Allen-
town’”’ makes a forceful state-

ment.

“Laura” is a sensitive song
where he agonizes about how to
deal with an old friend, ‘‘how do
you hang up on someone who
needs you that bad?”’

The most powerful song on
the album is ‘‘Goodbye
Saigon,’’ where Joel verbalizes
the rage and frustration of the
Vietnam veterans. Opening
with the sound of synthesized
helicopters, the song starts off
slowly and with a touch of sur-
realism. It inspires a mental
image hauntingly like ‘‘Apoca-
lypse Now.” Thoroughout the
song he keeps building up the
tension, finally venting his
anger at the end. He cries out at
the lack of support at home,
praises the comraderie of the
fighting men and screams at
the terror of the night, which

Superdance to be held

next weekend

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

Having seen Jerry Lewis
screaming for cash every Labor
Day for years now, everyone
has been conditioned to think of
any event connected with the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion as a simple fund raising af-
fair. W&L’s fifth annual 30-hour
long Superdance, however, is
designed to offer much more
than a loud master of
ceremonies.

Scheduled for January 28, 29,
and 30, in Evans Dining Hall,
the dance will include activities
and attractions for those who
don’t dance as well as those who
do. Four popular regional
bands, pie throws, volleyball
and frisbee contests are plan-
ned to attract students not par-
ticipating in the marathon.

The four bands include
Casper, which is a Top-40 band
that plays songs by musicians
such as Bruce Springsteen,
Stevie Wonder and the Police.

The Red Ball Jets is another
of the bands scheduled to ap-
pear. The band has a strong
following at W&L and plays
tunes from bands that include

Tom Petty and the Heart-
breakers, the Rollings Stones
and The Who.

Those looking for funk and
beach music will look forward
.to Casper appearing at the
dance marathon. Certainly the
most popular act that will ap-
pear is the Skip Castro Band,
which is an excellent bar band
that plays a wide variety of
music including rockabilly.

The pie throws will involve
student’s bidding on a chance to
toss pies into the faces of
various faculty members. Pro-

._ fessor Ham Smith, Dean At-

wood, Professor Julius
Overbeck and Maj. John Meers
are expected to be among those
who will be victims of student
frustration. Students are en-
couraged by Townsend Oast,
Chairman of the Superdance
Committee, to pool their money
in order to ensure the highest
bid for a certain professor.
Admission to the Superdance
is $5 per person and $8 per cou-
ple and is good for the entire 30
hours. Beer will be served at the
event at additional cost. Stu-
dents who are interested in dan-
cing are encouraged to contact
Carole Chappell at her office.

the enemy owned: In a drastic
contrast, he deals with war and
death in a quiet acoustic piece
that ends with the sounds of a
still night.

At once Joel is successful in
making an album that is smooth
and soothing musically, while
the lyrics demand close atten-
tion and can sometimes vent the
rage of the common citizen. It is
a good album.

What Billy Joel accomplished
through musicianship and liter-
ate lyrics Ozzy Osbourne tries
to do through screaming guitar
riffs, thunderous backing and
feedback. Both artists express
rage against their plight in life
and things that are out of their
control, but Osbourne does it in
: far more primal way, violent-

y.
Osbourne’s new album,
“Speak of the Devil,” is a dou-

‘ble live set recorded at the Ritz

in New York City. All the songs
go back to Osbourne’s days with
Black Sabbath and represent an
outstanding selection of Sab-
bath staples.

Although very weak vocally,
as Osbourne always has been,
the album is often excellent in-
strumentally, with guitarist
Brad Gillis often shows up Sab-
bath guitarist Tony Iommi.
Gillis, another guitarist that
Osbourne found in club circuits,
replaces Randy Rhoades, who
was killed last spring in a plane
crash.

The album has a number of
Sabbath’s greatest songs, in-
cluding ‘Iron Man/Children of
the Grave,” ‘Fairies Wear
Boots,” and a rousing version of
“Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.”’
“‘War Pigs,” from Sabbath’s se-
cond album, is probably the
high point of this album.

The album is a must for any
Black Sabbath or Ozzy Os-
bourne fan, but anyone who is
not into heavy metal should
stay far away. The album is
hard, grating, agressive and
angry. It is an audio assault
that never stops and never
mellows. Perhaps the best
selection of live Sabbath
material available now, I would
recommend any headbanger to
look into this album, but human
beings should steer clear.

As a final note, Clash fans
should keep on the lookout for a
“best of’’ album. Radio stations
have gotten an album called
“The World According to
Clash,’’ that covers all their
albums and has a number of
great songs including ‘‘London
Calling,” ‘Train in Vain’’ and
“*Rock the Casbah.’’ No news on
whether a regular release is ex-
pected, but if it is released it
will be a must for any collec-
tion.

Cagers Run Streak to Nine

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Running its winning streak to
nine games, the Washington
and Lee basketball team
defeated Emory and Henry,
Bridgewater and Mary Wash-
ington last week to improve the
Generals’ Old Dominion
Athletic Conference record to
3-1 and their overall mark to
10-2.

Last Thursday night in the
Warner Center the Generals
struggled against a surprisingly
tough Emory and Henry squad.
W&L managed to pull out a
75-68 win despite inconsistent
play.

“We took steps to correct
that,”’ noted W&L Coach Verne
Canfield concerning the Gener-
als’ sub-par performance
against Emory and Henry.
“And to the credit of the
players, they did correct that
for the most part,’ Canfield
concluded.

For the first time in a long
time the Generals fell behind
early in the game, as the Wasps
built a quick 10-2 lead. E&H’s
Bruce Bailey hit four con-
secutive outside jump shots to
fuel the Wasps’ early surge.

W&L, led by the scoring of
Billy Yates and John Lee
Graves, gradually narrowed
the gap, and actually held one-
point leads several times in the
half. Emory and Henry how-
ever, took a tenuous 33-32 lead
into the locker room at half
time.

W&L finally started to take
control of the game in the open-

ing minutes of the second half.
The Generals grabbed their
first lead of more than a point
when a Brian Hanson basket
put W&L in front 38-35 with 17
minutes left in the game. Three
minutes later a Graves goal ex-
tended the Generals’ lead to
46-39.

Emory and Henry, led by its
superb power forward Boo
Chafin, refused to allow the
Generals to pull away though.
The Wasps tied the score at
55-55 with 5:55 left to play to set
the stage for a tight finish.

Consecutive baskets by
Frank Eppes, Hanson, and
Yates re-established a six point
cushion for W&L, and the foul-
plagued Wasps could not éatch
the Generals. Several Generals
hit key foul shots down the
stretch to seal the 75-68 win.

John Lee Graves led the
Generals with 24 points and
Yates and Hanson added 16 and
14 points respectively.

W&L had considerably less
trouble in defeating Bridge-
water College Saturday at
Bridgewater, as the Generals
led almost the entire game on
the way to an 89-80 victory.

‘‘We had the concentration at
both ends of the court that we
needed,” stated Canfield. ‘‘For
the most part we got the job
done.”’

The Generals had a par-
ticularly outstanding night
shooting, hitting 66 percent of
their field goal attempts. Con-
centration, shot selection, mak-
ing the offense work, and good
individual efforts were cited by

Canfield as the reasons for the
excellent shooting percentage.
Billy Yates led the Generals
with 22 points, including four
three-point baskets. Hanson ad-
ded 21 for the Generals and
Graves tossed in 14 points.

Tuesday night against Mary
Washington, the Generals held
a comfortable double-digit lead
throughout most of the game,
and had little trouble in down-
ing the Blue Tide 82-65.

The Generals led 40-26 at the
half, and never allowed the Blue
Tide to get any closer than 11
points in the second half.

All five W&L starters scored
in double figures. Hanson led
the Generals with 20 points.
Graves, Eppes, and Yates all
tossed in 15 and Chris Baldwin
added 10 points.

Tonight in the Warner Center
the Generals tangle with
nationally-ranked Roanoke Col-
lege in an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference game start-
ing at 7:30 p.m.

The Maroons own a 9-0 record
after Monday evening’s win
against Catholic.

“The Roanoke game will take
care of itself,” explained Can-
field when asked if he put any
special emphasis on the upcom-
ing clash with the Maroons.
“The players themselves put a
special emphasis on the
Roanoke game,” stated Can-
field.

Coach Ed Green’s Maroons
are lead by senior forward
Gerald Holmes. This season
Holmes is one of the leading
scorers in the ODAC, averaging
17.6 points per game.

‘“‘We would like to control the
tempo in any game we play,”
noted Canfield. ‘‘But specifical-
ly against Roanoke, we don’t
want to get into a running
game.”

Last year against Roanoke,
the Generals defeated the
Maroons 62-61, but lost two con-
tests at Roanoke. The 62-61
W&L win was a superb game,
won in the closing seconds on a
basket by senior George
Spears.

Coach Optimistic
AboutComing Week

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

The W&L swim team is
continuing its travel down the
road of individual improvement
and Coach Page Remillard will
be looking for that development
to manifest itself with a pair of
upsets as the Generals travel to
Shepherd College on Friday
evening and return home Satur-
day afternoon to face
Georgetown.

‘‘We’ll be going for a couple of
victories this weekend,’ re-
marked the Generals’ fourth
year mentor, who looks at the
upcoming contests as a ‘‘con-
fidence building weekend.”

W&L takes a 2-3 slate into Fri-
day night’s action. The Gen-
erals are coming off two defeats
from last weekend’s dual meets
against the Dukes of James
Madison and the Tigers of
Towson State. W&L was down-
ed by JMU Friday night 78-29
and lost to Towson on Saturday
afternoon 71-42.

Despite the two setbacks,
Remillard sees his swimmers
handling the team defeats and
still concentrating on earning
personal best times. ‘‘The en-
thusiasm is still there,”
Remillard said. He hopes his
swimmers will start to evaluate
less than best performances as
commendable given such cir-
cumstances as last week’s ex-

tensive workout schedule.

 

 

eee Me Me ee

The Generals got fine perfor-
mances from four of their key
competitors. Junior Gary
Meyer, sophomores Bobby
Pearson and Taber Smith, and
freshman John Moody turned in
performances that illustrated
the personal progression that
Remillard looks for.

“I’m looking forward to the
meets, and the team will be
working this week, believing
that they can win,” said
Remillard, who will take a
rested and confident squad to
Shepherdstown, West Virginia
for what will undoubtedly be the
beginning of a_ profitable
weekend.

POOLSIDE: Meyer turned in
four sub-50-second 100-yard free
swims last weekend, while
Smith had two 23-second efforts
in the 50-free and Moody cut
five seconds off his 500-free
time between Friday and Satur-
day. Pearson, who already
swims in the freestyle and
backstroke events, showed his
versatility when he tried the
200-yard breaststroke with
respectable results...Sweet
Briar College will team with the
W&L men for a co-ed format in
Saturday’s meet at Cy Twom-
bly pool against Georgetown.
It’s a combination that’s work-
ed before, and, as Remillard
noted, ‘‘W&L has always swum
well with Sweet Briar on the
deck.’’ The contest starts at 2

Fencers Remain. Dedicated Despite Obstacles

By LEE NICHOLS
Phi Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee
Fencing Club was organized in
January, 1977, by Dr. James
Worth, University psychologist.
Worth, a varsity fencer at Ohio
State, has participated in the
sport since he was 15; in 1976 he
was ranked first in Virginia in
sabre competition. After spend-
ing time as an assistant coach
to the VMI fencing club, Worth
decided to found a club here at
W&L. His efforts started with
posters on campus beckoning
interested students, no ex-
perience necessary. Some 35
people showed up for that first
meeting; 12 men stayed with
the program and the Fencing
Club was on its way.

Fencing is a non-body contact
sport played on both the club
and intercollegiate levels.
Fencing bouts, as they are call-
ed, are conducted on a 40 meter
strip; each fencer is equipped
with a protective mask, jacket,
and gloves, and one of three
types of weapons. The winner of
a bout is that competitor who
can score five ‘‘touches’’ on his
opponent first. Touches are
generally recorded by sophis-
ticated electrical scoring
devices, but in the case of sabre
competition a panel of five
judges determines the scoring.

There are three different

BEAT ROANOKE

TONITE

fencing categories involving
different weapons and target
areas. The foil weapon is the
basic weapon of fencing; it is

the lightest of the three and is

also used for training purposes
for all beginners. In foil com-
petition only touches on the op-
ponent’s torso with the tip of the
weapon are counted. The
weapon used in epee competi-
tion is heavier than that of foil;
this sword is a close approxima-
tion of the dueling swords of old.
In epee bouts the whole body is
the target area, but once again
the touch must be made with
the point of the weapon. The
third fencing category is the
sabre class. This sword is an
adaptation of the old cavalry
sabres, although they are
substantially lighter. In sabre
competition the target area is
above the waist, and scores can
be made with the edges of the
sword as well as the tip.

Nine men participate in a
fencing meet, three in each
class of competition. Each man
duels the three opponents in his
class, so that a meet consists of
27 bouts. Each bout is a
“winner-take-all’’ situation; it
doesn’t matter whether the
score is 5-0 or 5-4. For this
reason, the final outcome of a
meet may not be indicative of
the closeness of the competi-
tion. In W&L’s first meet of the
year against VMI, W&L lost

   

    

18-9. However five of the
Generals’ bouts were determin-
ed by a single touch; if these
had gone the other way W&L
would have come out a winner.

Under the capable direction
of Coach Worth, the W&L fenc-
ing club has enjoyed a fair
amount of success. ‘“‘Over the
years we have compiled a win-
loss record of about 50 percent.
We are not an outstanding
team, but we have had some in-
dividuals stand out. Senior Pat
Berg was ranked third in Vir-
ginia in sabre competition fol-
lowing last year’s state tourna-
ment.”

Worth discussed the merits of
the sport of fencing and why he
introduced the sport at W&L.
“Fencing is a sport you can en-
joy all of your life; I personally
have fenced against men in
their 70s and 80s who were still
respectable fencers. Secondly,
you can start from scratch as a
freshman, and with some hard
work develop into an ac-
complished fencer in a year or
two. Most importantly, fencing
is a sport anyone can par-
ticipate in; a lack in physical
size or strength may be com-
pensated for by timing,
quickness and savvy.”

Coach Worth is concerned
with the future of fencing at
W&L for several reasons. First
of all, he states that the fencing
teams at both James Madison

 

and George Mason Universities
have been forced to disband due
to a lack of support and the loss
of necessary funds. According
to Worth, the fencing club
received $700 last year from the
Executive Committee, which
falls well short of the team’s
necessary expenses, which in-
clude maintenance of electrical
equipment, replacement blades
and travel expenses. The team,
whose schedule includes meets
with Duke, U.Va., and Virginia
Tech, is no longer able to com-
pete with schools such as Navy,
William & Mary, and the Uni-
versity of Baltimore due to lack
of sufficient funds for an over-
night stay.

Despite his concern over the
financial problems the team
has to face, Worth feels that
fencing will survive owing to
the dedication of the par-
ticipants. ‘‘These guys are ex-
tremely dedicated to fencing.
They begin practice at the end
of September for a season that
doesn’t start til after
Christmas. They pay for their
own equipment as well as some
of their travel expenses, and
they get virtually no recogni-
tion.”

This year’s squad has ten
dedicated members. In the foil
division are seniors John
Viahoplus and Leigh Kaplan,
junior Allen Coe, and freshman
Mike Grow. Competing in epee

Chinese, Polynesian, and
American Cuisine
Exotic Cocktails

 

  
  

are junior team captain Rick
Swagler, classmate Sean Len-
non and freshman Cotton
Puryear. Dueling in the sabre
division are brothers Pat and
Mike Berg, a senior and a
freshman respectively, and
junior Chuck Depoy.

Out of curiosity I went to one
of the team’s practices to get a
feel for what fencing is all
about. One thing that impressed
me was that the participants

_ were not built like basketball

centers or defensive linemen.
Fencing is a_ fast-paced
calculated action which re-
quires agility as well as en-
durance; fencing practice did
not appear to be a stroll through
the park.

The fencing club’s next match
is Sat., Jan. 29, against Duke at
VMI. The fencing will begin at
1:30 p.m.

After seeing all of the hard
work that these people are put-
ting into fencing. I feel that the
student body should give the
team the support they deserve.
Stop by the match at VMI for a
while, or go watch a practice in
the gym some afternoon. Fenc-
ing may not be for everyone,
but it deserves our attention
and support.
