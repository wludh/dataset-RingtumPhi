Third Keydet dies after crash ~

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Stanley Ross, a second classman at Virginia
f Military Institute, died Tuesday night from injuries
suffered in an automobile accident in which two
other cadets and one Randolph-Macon Woman’s
College student were immediately killed Saturday,
a spokesman for VMI said.

Ross died in a Roanoke hospital where he had
_ been taken immediately after the accident Satur-

_ day morning.

Diane Elaine Doggett, a Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College student also injured in the acci-
dent, will undergo surgery to reset her broken jaw
this week. Despite injuries sustained in the acci-

dent, she is in stable condition, according to sources
in the Office of the Dean at Randolph-Macon.

At about 2:45 Saturday morning, a Plymouth
Horizon containing the 3 VMI students and 2
Randolph-Macon girls was travelling south on U.S.
11 in excess of 100 mph, according to police tests,
when the driver lost control of the vehicle. The
Plymouth turned on its side and skidded almost 500
feet before it plunged into the median and rolled
over several times.

The vehicle came to rest in the northbound lane
where it was then clipped by a vehicle driven by
Forrest Jenkins, a junior at W&L, and then hit

Sloppiness cost FD $15,000,director says

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi Staff Writer

Of the more than $65,000 spent for last
year’s Fancy Dress Weekend, at least
$15,000 was lost through poor manage-
ment or bad planning, according to two
students associated with the event.

The ‘‘waste’’ was detailed by this
year’s Fancy Dress director, John
Haywood, and confirmed by former
SAB treasurer Randall Jacoby. It in-
cludes:

yvpaying $6,500 for decorative
lighting and the expenses of a Florida
lighting consultant and_ three
assistants,

vy paying more than $1,400 to two
women for designing the balcony
backdrop (materials not included),

vusing materials for the backdrop
that were unsuited and unnecessarily
expensive, and

paying Washington and Lee $6,000
for the morning-after clean-up.

Haywood cited John Martin and Bob-
by Schmidt as the main contributors to
the overspending. Martin was a co-
chairman of the Student Activities
Board, and Schmidt chaired the
University Center Committee, which
answers directly to the SAB. Both Mar-
tin and Schmidt graduated last year.

Contacted at home in Richmond,
Martin challenged some of the figures
cited by Haywood and Jacoby. His
main objection to the allegations is that
the budget for Fancy Dress was set to
match expected ticket sales of 2,000.
When only 1,450 tickets were sold, the
finger-pointing began, Martin said.

“If we had sold all those tickets, you
wouldn’t be hearing any of this,’’ Mar-
tin said.

Martin also blamed the new location
for some of the over-runs. Last year
was the first time Fancy Dress was
held in the new gym.

Haywood said that a large part of the
$15,000 lost could have been saved if the
weekend’s Atlanta Rhythm Section con-
cert had been more successful.

The concert cost $21,000 to produce
and only collected $8,000 in ticket sales.
Haywood attributed that loss to poor
planning and said that a venture of this
type will probably not be tried in the
future.

Martin dismissed the allegation that

the ARS concert was poorly planned as
irrelevant.

Because the 1982 Fancy Dress budget
was vague and did not detail ‘‘miscella-
neous expenditures,” it is hard to tell
who’s closer to the truth —Martin or
Haywood.

But even a carefully prepared budget
could not settle the question, ‘‘Was the
$65,000-plus event worth it?”’

Haywood called many of the decora-
tion expenses ‘‘unnecessary.”’

The decorative illumination of the
two gyms was done by Frost II-
luminating Co. of West Palm Beach,
Fla. Four employees of the company
were flown up and paid $6,500 for work-
ing a day and a half hanging lights.

Haywood said that the lighting was
“‘good, but not worth $6,500.”’

The company was recommended by
Schmidt’s mother and Martin’s aunt.

Martin said he appeals to the students
to decide whether the lighting was
worth it, as he believed it was. He said
another lighting company was asked to
submit an estimate but that Frost was
more economical.

“This year, we don’t want to continue
that kind of outside help. Outside con-
tracting will only be used when it is ab-
solutely necessary,’’ Haywood stated.

Another bone of contention is the —

backdrop for the gym balcony, which
was made up to portray a Paris street.
For services that are not detailed in the
budget, Ellen Gervey and Karen Lee
were paid $650 and $770 respectively.

Martin said that Gervey had ex-
perience designing backdrops for the
W&L drama department and that Lee
was a local art teacher. He said that the
designing, painting and sewing they did
justified the $1,400-plus expense.

“It’s ridiculous to pay for work that
we could do ourselves,’’ Haywood said.

Furthermore, these two women were
contracted by Scmidt and Martin
without the permission of the SAB and
without open discussion, Jacoby and
Haywood said.

When asked about this, Martin said
he could not recall whether the board
had been informed.

This backdrop, Haywood claims, was
more expensive than necessary. Foam
board was used when corrugated card-
board would have been cheaper, he
said.

  

 

The materials were also unsuited for

the job. When the foam board was ©

painted, it warped and had to be hot-
glued to the wall of the balcony,
Haywood said. That added to the cost of
cleaning up.

The use of lighter-weight materials in
the backdrop and the use of an SAB
member to design it would have saved
approximately $2,000, Haywood said.
All expenditures for the backdrop were
approved by Martin.

Martin said that the budget for the
balcony was $2,000 and that he stayed
under that figure.

Because the list of miscellaneous sup-
plies for Fancy Dress was not itemized,
Martin’s claim cannot be immediately
backed up. Neither can Haywood’s
claim, for that matter.

Another unnecessary expense was
artwork, Haywood said. A Hollins Col-
lege student was paid about $200 for
various designs, including the invita-
tion. Haywood thinks this too should
have been done by SAB members.

Although Haywood, a sophomore,
does not think the SAB should do all the
cleanup, he said that this aspect was
much too expensive last year.

‘People were getting time and a half
for tearing paper off the wall,”
Haywood said. ‘‘Buildings and Grounds

 

did an excellent job, but it wasn’t worth
the money.”

Clean-up costs alone were $6,000, a
tenth of the budget.

Buildings and Grounds and the SAB
did not get their signals straight on the
clean-up, either. Haywood said the SAB
intended to take down the silver-colored
ceiling covering with its own members.
Instead, Buildings and Grounds took it
down and damaged it in the process.

Also, several ice-chests owned by the
Dining Hall were thrown out instead of
returned, according to former SAB
member Chris Peacock, who has
graduated.

The only thing that everyone agrees
on is this: the SAB can tighten its ac-
counting and spending procedures. SAB
chairman Lanier Edge stated recently
that access to SAB funds will be limited
more this year than last.

As it was, the system of sending out
checks did not allow accountants to tell
what the checks had been used for.

Haywood forsees little of the confu-
sion that marked last year’s Fancy
Dress in this year’s ball. He added that
under the leadership of Edge, the whole
SAB would run more smoothly.

‘“‘The number-one problem was hav-
ing two co-chairmen trying to handle
everything instead of delegating
authority,’’ Haywood said.

last year’s Fancy Dress ARS concert.

Fancy Dress will not be mov-

Committee decided at its Mon-
day night meeting.

Law school representative
Ken Terwilleger was expected

allowance” to law students
because of their exclusion. This
allowance might take the form
of cheaper tickets or a larger
allotment of funds to the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

To justify tha: motion, Ter-
willeger commented that the
weekend was ‘‘adversely
scheduled’ regarding law
students, that it cut into their
break, and that there was a
“good sense of unfairness.”’

Vice President Morgan Grif-
fith came out against the mo-
tion saying it was ‘“‘too com-
plicated and sets a bad prece-
dent. We should defeat this now,
and remember it when the SBA
budget comes up.”’

Terwilleger countered, say-
ing “If we vote this motion
down, we’re going to dig a
deeper chasm,” referring to the
separation of the law and under-
graduate schools. In response,
Terwilleger withdrew his
original motion and introduced
a compromise motion.

The new motion asked that
the committee remember that
the law students were being
“denied” Fancy Dress when
considering the SBA budget.

The motion passed.

The Committee also discuss-
ed the student tax of $60 and
whether or not it should be rais-
ed for the 1983-84 academic year
to help defray the costs of Mock
Convention.

EC settles FD question

Pete Baumgaertner introduc-
ed a motion that the student tax
remain at $60. Gunnar Jordan
of the Mock Convention Com-
mittee said that extra money
was needed ‘“‘to cover ex-
penses.”’

President Bennett Ross com-
mented that he thought it was
‘really mnecessary.’’ In
response, Baumgaertner
replaced his motion with a new
motion to increase the tax to $70
with the stipulation that $5 from
each student go to the Mock
convention. The other $5 is a
traditional raise to help support
new organizations.

Junior Representative Ted .

McQuiston asked if $5 was
enough, and Jordan replied that
the committee had really
wanted to propose a $10-per-
student appropriation. Ross,
however, replied that ‘‘they can
propose all they want,” and the
$70 student tax was approved.

In other business, Ross an-
nounced that (John Sancilio)
had been elected Freshman
Law Representative, and that
petitions for freshman elections
were due with 50 signatures on
Monday, October 8 in the EC
room. The elections will be held
on Monday Oct. 18.

Budget hearings have been
moved to Wednesday, Oct. 6, at
5p.m.

The complex legal battle for
‘e possession of Col Alto, the
storic Lexington house now
wned by Washington and Lee,
ill continue for some time as
2 result of a court ruling Mon-

ay.

U.S. District Court Judge J.
arry Michael upheld his ruling
‘ last June that a federal court
es not have jurisdiction in the
ise. The complete implica-
.ons of the judgment for either
de are unclear.

Col Alto, a large property
aar the Lambda Chi Alpha
aternity house, was given to
ie University by Rosa Tucker
4ason in 1957 with the stipula-
on that the University would
.ke possession upon her death.
he died in January 1961.

Laura Tucker Fletcher, 89,
.e sister of Mrs. Mason, is su-
ig for title to the house and $1
sillion in damages on the
-ounds that the property is not
ing used as Mrs. Mason in-
_nded when she bequeathed it
» the school.

The 17-room house, which sits
1a hill atop eight acres of pro-
erty on Lexington’s east side,
as built in 1827 by James
IcDowell, former governor of
‘irginia. Mrs. Fletcher’s suit,
‘led in April 1981, charged the
miversity with “neglect” of
ye property.

‘The building is now used
cimarily for storage. In the
ast, it has housed students and
‘een the site of informal social
unctions.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
V&L president Robert E.R.
iuntley, said Wednesday that
he property “has been used all
slong.” He added that Pro-
essors Hamer and Stevenson
urrently live in outbuildings,
r “‘dependencies,”’ of Col Alto.

Reached Wednesday at Judge
dichael’s chambers in Char-

et tt <b> @<aE 0-0

lottesville, clerk of the court
John MclIntosh detailed the
judge’s ruling for the Ring-tum
Phi. (Local newspapers have
misinterpreted the edict.)

Monday’s action was a sus-
tainment of a June 7 ruling.
This original ruling stated that
Mrs. Fletcher’s case, as filed,
cannot be heard in federal
court. Judge Michael’s ruling
“was just that he didn’t have
jurisdiction. . .he has not ruled
on the merits of the case,”
McIntosh said.

The June 7 decision would
have stood had not the the plain-
tiff (Mrs. Fletcher) appealed
the ruling. Judge Michael heard
additional arguments this sum-
mer and handed down the same
ruling as before.

Mrs. Fletcher’s attorney, E.
Griffith Dodson Jr., has said
that he will appeal the decision
to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Richmond.
According to Mcintosh, that
court could overturn Monday’s
decision regarding jurisdiction.
and send the case back to Judge
Michael for a ruling on its
merits.

The question of jurisdiction is
a complex one. The case was
entered in federal court
because of ‘‘diversity” — Mrs.
Fletcher lives in Maryland, and
W&L is incorporated in Virgina.

So far, simple enough.

However, Judge Michael
dismissed the case because he

believes that Mrs. Mason’s
nieces and nephews, in addition
to Mrs. Fletcher, have an in-
terest in the case.

Therefore, they had to par-
ticipate, or ‘‘be joined,’’ in the
suit. Some of the nieces and
nephews live in Virginia, which
“destroys diversity,’’ McIntosh
said.

If any of the plaintiffs reside
in the same state as the defen-
dant, the case is then a matter
for the state court instead of the
federal court.

Dodson said Wednesday from

his office in Roanoke that he

and his client disagree with
Judge Michael’s statement that
the court had found ‘“‘beyond
doubt that Mrs. Mason’s nieces
and nephews have an interest
relating to the subject.”’

Will he appeal Monday’s deci-

sion? “That’s our plan,” Dod-

son said.
The length of the appeals pro-
cess, Dodson said, ‘‘depends on

the congestion of the docket of }

the the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals.’’ Dodson said he had

 

not talked to Mrs. Fletcher as

since Monday’s ruling, but that
he had mailed her the news.

He refused further comment
on the case.

Eric Lee Sisler, W&L’s at-
torney, declined to discuss the
litigation. “That’s not some-
thing I do. . .I don’t generally
talk with the press.”’

The Ross solution

By TODD SMITH
Phi Editor-in-Chief.

Bennett Ross thinks he has a
solution to a big problem:
Budgets.

The Executive Committee
returned from summer vaca-
tion afraid that they were
dangerously low on money.
Representatives were unsure as
to whether the Interfraternity
Council was going to be able to
make the second payment on a
pledge of $7,500 for the Contact
speakers program. It was
rumored that the IFC had spent
the money on its Spring
Weekend because it had never
received a bill from the EC.

The IFC did pay off the rest of
the pledge by the start of school.
(It should be noted that the IFC
is not an EC subcommittee. )

But the problem remains —
Who is keeping track of student
funds? Your student activities
fee is increasing to $70 from $60
this year and $55 last year.
That’s a hefty jump, but it’s not
Ross’ solution.

Ross is president of the EC,

~ but his remedy depends mostly

on his vice president, law school
student Morgan Griffith. The
plan is for Griffith to sit down
with every subcommittee a cou-
ple of times each semester and
go over the University com-
puter‘s print-out of the subcom-
mittee’s expenditures.

Had the Student Activities
Board been answerable for its
expenditures, we students
might now be able to figure out
what happened to the $65,000 to
$70,000 spent on the Fancy
Dress Ball. According to last
year’s treasurer Randall
Jacoby and this year’s Fancy
Dress director John Haywood, a
great deal of that money fell
through the cracks.

As our page-one story in-
dicates, there is no reliable way
to figure out how much was
done by special consultants to
the SAB. Another problem is the
SAB practise of writing
vouchers out in the name of

members (‘‘pay Joe Schmoe
$100”) so ‘that kegs can be
bought at the last minute.

But the IFC and the SAB are
not alone. All subcommittees
would benefit from a.better net-
work of communications on
financial matters. Even the
Ring-tum Phi found its books
slightly inaccurate when the
computer print-out was brought

in.

So the Ross solution depends
on Morgan Griffith. Our vice
president was an outstanding
member on the EC last year,
and is up to the job. Last year
Griffith first learned of the Ross
solution through a Phi staff
writer and scoffed. But Ross
has not backed down, and he
said Wednesday that Griffith
was now agreeable.

With the W&L Mock Conven-
tion shifting into high gear for
the spring of 1984, the EC must
take on the burden of clarifying
the budget system before more
money is lost. This means that
the overworked EC cannot kick
back and relax after ths
Wednesday’s budget hearings.
It’s a year-long job.

Reagan line on loans

The author, Edward Elmendorf, is Deputy Assistant Secretary for Stu-
dent Financial Assistnace in the Department of Education.

Newspaper, radio, and television reports of substantial cuts in
Federal financial aid to college students have triggered a barrage
of phone calls to the U.S. Department of Education in Washington,
D.C.

Callers, both students and parents, are often confused by
misleading or incomplete information. Many have expressed fear
that the government has let them down; that college is no longer af-
fordable.

It is true that student financial assistance programs have
undergone considerable change in the past two years, There have
been some reductions. Most of the changes, however, reflect an ef-
fort to return the aid programs to their original purpose, which was
to help students cover the cost of a college education — not carry
the whole burden. A successful return to original intent will help en-
sure the survival of these aid programs for future students.

Federal financial assistance is divided into three categories.
“Grants” are awards of money that do not have to be paid back.
“‘Loans’’ are borrowed money which a student must repay with in-
terest. “‘Work-Study” provides the chance to work and earn money
to off-set college costs while attending classes.

The Pell Grant Program is one of the best known of the Federal
student aid programs. Formerly called the Basic Educational Op-
portunity Grant, Pell is often the first source of aid in a package
which may be composed of other Federal and non-Federal sources. .
In the 1982-83 school year, 2.55 million students share $2,279,040,000
in Pell Grants.

The U.S. Department of Education uses a standard formula to
determine who qualifies for Pell Grants. Students should contact
the college financial aid administrator to apply on the free “‘Ap-
plication for Federal Student Aid.’’ This is the form used for all
Federal student aid programs. The Department guarantees that
each participating school will receive the money it needs to pay
Pell Grants to eligible students.

The Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant provides
another mechanism for making awards to students. SEOG is dif-
ferent from the Pell Grant in that it is managed by the financial aid
administrator of each participating college. Each school receives a
set amount of money from the Department and when that money is
gone, there are no more SEOG funds for the year.

In 1982-83 the Department of Education will provide 440,000
students with $278,400,000 in Supplemental Educational Opportuni-
ty Grants. Students will get up to $2,000 a year under this program.

Grant programs are designed to help the most needy students get
a college education. The Pell Grant, in particular, is targeted to
help those students whose families earn less than $12,000 per year.
Grant aid is not meant to cover all college costs but is expected to
be combined with a reasonable contribution from the student’s
family and individual self-help, generally in the form of loans,
private scholarships, and work.

Another type of student financial assistance is the College Work-
Study Program. Designed to provide on- or off-campus jobs for
undergraduate and graduate students who need financial
assistance, Work-Study is usually managed by the college financial
aid administrator. Some 950,000 students will receive $528 million
under this program in 1982-83.

A great deal of publicity has been generated lately on Federal
student loans, particularly the National Direct Student Loan Pro-
gram. Although all colleges do not participate in the NDSL pro-
gram, 3,340 of them do. This program makes available low interest
(5 percent) loans that students must begin repaying six months
after completing school (either by graduating, leaving, or dropping
below half-time status). Up to 10 years is allowed to repay the loan.
Application is made to a school’s financial aid adminstrator who
manages the loan fund. The fund is a revolving account, designed to
allow a school to continually make new loans as existing loans are
repaid. About 800,000 students will receive NDSLs in 1982-83; 10,000
more than in 1981-82.

Recently, Secretary of Education R.H. Bell signed a regulation
which provides incentives for an institution to reduce the default
rate of its NDSL program fund. A college which has a default rate
over 25 percent is asked to turn responsibility for collecting the debt
over to the Federal government. If an institution is not prepared to
do this, and the default rate remains 25 percent or more, the
Federal government will cut off NDSL funding.

The Guaranteed Student Loan Program, much in the news lately,
makes available low interest loans to students; with the Federal
government paying the interest while a student is in school. These
loans are made by a lender (such as a bank, credit union, or sav-
ings and loan association) and insured by either the Federal
government or a State Guarantee Agency. This, the largest student
aid program, will make available over $9.5 billion in loans during
the 1982-83 school year.

Undergraduate students can borrow up to $2,500 a year and
graduate students can borrow up to $5,000 under GSL. The total
debt an undergraduate can carry is $12,500. For graduate or profes-
sional study this figure is $25,000. A student borrower whose family
income is less than $30,000 automatically qualifies for an interest-
subsidized loan. Students whose family income exceeds $30,000
may still be eligible for GSL interest benefits if the college’s finan-
cial aid administrator determines that the student has
demonstrated financial need.

A new program started in 1981, called the Auxiliary Loan (or
PLUS) Program, allows parents, independent students, and
graduate students to borrow up to $3,000 a year. There is no income
cut off for eligibility. The interest on PLUS loans will be lowered
from 14 to 12 percent sometime in October as a result of lower
average U.S. Treasury bill interest rates.

As the economy continues to recover, we can expect a continued
lowering of interest rates, thus easing student repayment costs and
reducing Federal expenditures. In addition, the Reagan Ad-
ministration has embarked on a major initiative to collect delin-
quent and defaulted loans under the National Direct and
Guaranteed Student Loan Programs. It is anticipated that $80
million will be collected in 1983. Congress has been asked to allow
funds collected on delinquent loans to be recycled in the loan pro-
grams; under present law, such funds are returned to the
Treasury. Returning money to the loan funds would make more
money available to future college students.

Student aid reforms proposed by the Reagan Administration re-
establish the fundamental principle that a student and his or her
family share the primary responsibility for meeting college costs.
The Federal and State government have a role in bridging the gap
between what a family can reasonably contribute and the cost of at-
tending college. Only by maintaining its fiscal integrity can the
Federa! government continue to play its part in bridging this gap
through student aid programs.

 

Opinion

 

 

 

With freshman Executive
Committee elections Oct. 18,
it’s time to talk politics. Now,
in former times, the
greybeards tell me, campaigns
at W&L were wondrous things,
wrapped in bunting and
rhetoric. There was speechify-
ing and the kissing of babies,
the broaching of keys and the
slinging of mud. There was, in
short, fun.

No longer. I do not wish to
be disingenuous. I may very
well run for office again
myself. But regardless of

By Markham
S. Pyle

whether I do or not, I hope Our
Noble Leaders will see fit to
restore some color to the pre-
sent drab, pedestrian system
which elected them. One
longterm observer suggests
that this is in fact why they
don’t change the status quo,
that they feel lost without it. I
cannot say if this is true or
not. It is notable that, while
politics in general is the art of
the controversial, Our Noble
Leaders avoid same like Marx-
ists avoid Wall Street.
Whatever their motives for
promoting the present even-
handed dullness, I do know
that there is ample room for
improvement in the method
whereby we choose our
leaders.

One would assume, for in-
stance, that any public body
charged with the disbursment
of funds would by its alloca-
tions occasion controversy ;
and so it does. But no can-
didate for that august chamber
can, as matters now obtain,
address these issues while
campaigning. The most he can
do, really, is tape up some
hastily-crayoned posters and
hope it doesn’t rain. I have
racked the old grey matter
(which ain’t, I admit, what it
used to be), and I remain at a
loss for any rational explana-
tion for the status quo. I mean,
c’mon, guys, why aren’t there
speeches? I have often heard
electors lament that the most
they can do is vote for a
vaguely familiar face and keep
their fingers crossed.

It is only a combination of
dumb luck and the Grace of
God that has so far given us,
by and large, such decent and
diligent, if hardly notable, men
to serve us.

The remedy for this malaise
is, I am assured, a real cam-
paigning season, with
speeches, rallies, beer busts,
scandals and parades. I trust
Our Noble Leaders will lay
aside any purely personal con-
siderations and move to
restore what is at once a proud
tradition, a bold innovation
and just plain common sense.

Buddy Atkins addresses IFC Tuesday night. (Phi photo by David Sprunt)

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Phi Features Editor
Michael Raus, a sophomore

at American University in

Washington, says he noticed
two characteristics prevalent

among Washington and Lee

men: they are preppy, and they
are responsible and industrious
enough to handle a business of
their own.

Thus W&L became one of 12
schools at which Michael is now

attempting to sell a franchise of
his business, Rent-A-Prep.

Raus said the motto of the
company is “‘You name it, we

do it.”” From lawn mowing to

hedge work, housesitting to
bartending and painting, the
company rents out preps to take
care of customers’ needs.

The painters wear Rent-A-
Prep T-shirts and Duckhead
painters pants. Yard workers
sport madras shorts and

alligator shirts. Bartenders or
party-car-parkers don oxford
button downs, blazers, madras
slacks, and penny loafers.

   

Administrator night for the IFC

by JOHN HARRISON
Phi IFC Correspondent

Comments by Univeristy
Treasurer Stewert Epley and
Assistant Alumni Secretary
Buddy Atkins highlighted Tues-
day’s bi-monthly meeting of the
Interfraternity Council.

Epley emphasized the impor-
tance of each house keeping up
its payments to the school for
the mandatory maintenance
and operations program. Under
the program, which the Univer-
sity established in the summer
of 1980, inspectors go to each
house monthly to determine if
items such as stoves and elec-
trical wiring should be re-
paired. Each house pays a
minimum fee for the program.

Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Murphy told the Council
that questions about what
should and should not be
repaired should be directed to
James Arthur, Superintendant
of Buildings and Grounds.

After reminding the Council
that each chapter must submit
monthly financial statements,
Epley reemphasized that if a
house defaults on its monthly
payment, the school then has
the right to advertise the sale of
the house for four to six weeks.

Atkins stated that a major
concern of the Alumni Office is
alumni relations with their
fraternities.

In the interest of getting
alumni to support their houses
financially, he said, fraternities
need a project that alumni will
be willing to contribute to.

“Projects may vary from
house to house,” said Atkins;
“but they should lead to the
steady improvement of the
quality of the house. You want
to prove that present members
are interested in improving and
keeping up the house in order to
warrant their support,’’ Atkins
said.

Atkins added that his office
has received many com-
pliments from alumni who have
noticed the improvements in
the appearance of most houses
in the recent years.

IFC President Mason Ellerbe
reminded the Council that the
Lexington Police will not give
houses any more permits for
amplified music on weeknights.

After Ellerbe remarked that
the police’s new warning
system for loud music seems to
be working, Vice-President
Steve Jones and Murphy advis-

ed that the warning system
should not be taken advantage
of

Said Murphy, ‘The police
have been incredibly cooper-
ative about this, so don’t abuse
a

Murphy also advised the
houses against using the land
along the Maury River and the
area behind the Stonewall
Jackson House as sources of
bamboo for beach parties.

Chi Psi President Danny
Einstein told the council that he

would appreciate any coopera-’

tion in recovering $1,000 worth
of paintings and drawings that
were removed from the house
between 2 and 8 a.m. Sept. 19.

Phi Gamma Delta received
three weeks of probation from
the judicial Board of the IFC for
having a band on a weeknight.
Fiji President Chris Kibler said
the judgement would be appeal-
ed

Said Kibler, ‘‘We want to get
a thorough understanding of the
rules involved and what our op-
tions are. From what I’ve
heard, another house got only
two weeks for the same viola-
tion.”’

Raus said that he and his best
friend, Byron Burge, formed
the business the summer after
they graduated from Country
Day School in Louisville, Ken-
tucky.

“We couldn’t get summer
jobs, and the only way to make
some money for school was to
form our own business,” he said
ina recent telephone interview.

“The previous winter we had
parked cars at parties and
bartended, but that would have
limited us a great deal, so we
went into yard work. This sum-
mer we diversified even more
and went into house painting.

“We decided anyone could
ask to do odd jobs, but nine
times out of 10, a person with a
well-dressed appearance will
get the job over someone in rag-
ged out jeans and a T-shirt.

“Since we went to prep
school, we thought we’d use our
natural abilities — use what we
were raised as.

“The common idea is that
preps are lazy and lay around

and drink all the time. But
we're getting out and working
hard,” he said.

The business has now expand-
ed to 25 franchises From Dallas
to Nantucket. Franchises can
be bought for $350. Raus said
the licensing agreement in-
cludes the rights to use the
“Rent a Prep’’ logo and a
market management program
that teaches everything needed
by the franchise owner, ‘‘from
A to Z.” By the time he
graduates, Raus hopes to have
at least one franchise in every

- State in the union. At that time,

he plans on selling the business
to a new enterprising high
school entrepreneur.

Of the 12 schools, UVa and
Hampden-Sydney were also
chosen from Virginia. Harvard,
Princeton, and Yale topped the
list of remaining schools.

“It’s very popular in Virgin-
ia,” he concluded. “For one,
people are willing to work here,
and two, it’s a preppy area.”

Atwood’s FEC
shuffles schedules

By MIKE ALLEN

Phi staff writer
The Executive Committee
Monday night elected seniors
Pete Baumgaertner and Danny
Einstein as the two student
representatives to the Faculty
Executive Committee for this

academic year.
Dr. Edward Atwood, Jr.,
Dean of the School of

Economics, Commerce, and
Politics, is chairman of the
F.E.C. He recently discussed
the Committee’s functions.
“The majority of matters we
deal with are students desiring
exceptions to faculty regula-
tions,’’ Atwood said. He said the
F.E.C. also acts ‘‘ad interim”’
for the faculty — it takes ac-
tions on any matter which must
be dealt with before the mon-
thly faculty meeting.

“Anything that doesn’t clear-
ly belong to another committee
will usually come to the
F.E.C.,” said Dr. Atwood,
who’s been chairman of the
committee since he became
Dean in 1969.

An examination of the Com-
mittee’s minutes shows that it
deals primarily with matters
such as especially heavy or
light course loads, changes in
majors, and requests for excep-
tions to exam schedules and
other regulations. Dean Atwood
said such requests are granted
“when there are extenuating
circumstances beyond the con-
trol of the student.’’ Committee
decisions, he says, are general-
ly unanimous.

The F.E.C. also approves any

temporary change in the sche-
dule of classes, such as the
suspension of afternoon classes
for the Mock Convention. The
calendar for each academic
year is submitted toit each year
by a calendar committee. The
F.E.C. then discusses, and
sometimes amends it, before
approval. Therefore, the Com-
mittee was instrumental in set-
ting up the six-week Spring
term several years ago.

The Committee also im-
plemented the relatively recent
individual examinations sche-
dule W&L uses. This system
could be altered at any time by
Committee action.

“Tf it (individual exam sche-
dules) is ever changed, it’ll be
because students took advan-
tage of it,” Dean Atwood said.
“That doesn’t necessarily mean
cheating, but students who keep
changing exam times and mak-
ing trouble for everyone.”’

Dean Atwood says that
students who wish to appeal a
matter to the Committee should
do so in writing through his of-
fice. “Students do not appear
before the Committee,” he em-
phasized.

The Committee, which meets
weekly in McCormick Hall, sub-
mits its minutes for approval by
the University Council and then
the faculty. The F.E.C. is com-
posed of the Deans of the three
Colleges, the Dean of Students,
five faculty members who serve
three year terms and the two
students appointed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee who serve
one year terms.

to all people with a college I.D.
and there is no charge of admis-

First aid

Do you know what to do when
junior chugs the Drano under
the sink? Do you know what to
do when you encounter Lex-
ington’s inevitable, tragic auto
accidents? Do you know what
your camping partner has and
how to help him when he
becomes uncontrollably chilled,
nauseous, and delirious (as-
suming away drugs)?

It is important to be familiar
with basic emergency medical
procedures for injured persons.
Red Cross Advanced First Aid
provides practical knowledge
that allows effective help in
emergency situations. Such
knowledge is often required for
those who work with young peo-

ple in any variety of jobs. Such
knowledge is indispensable for
those who spend time in the out-
doors.

An Advanced First Aid course
will be offered this fall for the
Lexington-Buena Vista area if
enough individuals express in-
terest (6 or more). The course
will cover, among other topics:
burns, fractures, poisoning,
water safety, and artificial
respiration. The course will
meet twice a week and will in-
volve approximately 45 hours of
classroom time. Members of
the Buena Vista Rescue Squad
will conduct the course. The
evenings the class will meet will
depend on those involved.

The Lampost

Into the house of the Lord

By TOM BAKER
Phi Staff Writer

At first glance, the whole af-
fair could be described as your
basic Beatles theme party.

The bottom floor of the house
is filled with people dressed as
members of the Fab Four, lis-
tening to tunes from ‘‘Rubber
Soul.”

But there are subtle dif-
ferences to this gathering. No
one is going to dive off the man-
tle, climb on the roof, or roll
around on the floor. And no mat-
ter how much punch you drink,
your mental outlook is not going
to change.

These subtleties exist
because this is not a fraternity
party, but rather a ‘‘non-
alcoholic theme party” being
sponsored by the Lampost.
Despite being a fairly new and
obviously unorthodox group in
the Washington and Lee com-
munity, the people who live at
the Lampost are firm about the
purpose of their house.

According to Mo Gill, a senior
living at the Lampost, there is a
real ‘‘purpose’’ for the
organization. ‘‘It’s a house
where Christians can get
together to become a family in
Jesus Christ. Our first concern
is for each other,”’ Gill said.

“The Lampost is also an

outreach for those who don’t fit
into other (social) organiza-
tions,” Gill said. Moreover, Gill
sees the house as a ministry
that provides an outreach for
members of the community.

Keith Goretzka, Lampost
president, agrees with Gill that
Christian fellowship is the main
idea for the house.

Goretzka thinks of the Lam-
post as ‘‘nine fellows living
together (and) sharing their
lives in Christ.” This shared ex-
perience in Christ is enhanced,
according to Goretzka, by a
“spiritual fulfillment program”’
that includes morning prayers
and involvement with Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship.
The Lampost and I-VCF are two
separate organizations.

The house was started last
year by two W&L students,
Gary Carneal and Frank
Williams, who wanted a house
where students could live
together and strive for a Chris-
tian lifestyle. The two students
received strong support from
the university, in the form of a
low interest loan and from
private individuals, in the form
of gifts and donations, Goretzka
said.

The result of the two seniors’
efforts was a house on Randolph
Street and the commitment of

tive
pqeesoso) bel

thompson

surrounding women’s colleges

nine students to create a Chris-
tian environment.

While the students living in
the house have various back-
grounds and denominations,
they all admit some sort of
loyalty to living a Christian life,
Goretzka said.

As the program has progress-
ed, Goretzka has seen the role
of the house to expand in the
community. For example, last
spring when two women were
evicted from their apartment,
the Lampost provided a shelter
for them for several days.

While the social programs for
the Lampost might appear low-
key, Gill and Goretzka both feel
that the house provides a social
alternative that is more con-
structive and ‘‘wholesome”’
than many other social oppor-
tunities for W&L students.

The program includes these
non-alcoholic theme parties and
trips to the women’s colleges
for parties with fellowship
groups at those schools.

Goretzka also feels that the
university ‘‘seems more than
willing...to provide an alter-
native atmosphere that is more
constructive than other (social
opportunities ).’”’ Goretzka cited
the newly formed International
House as an example of the uni-
versity’s willingness.

Keith Goretzka (Photo by David Sprunt)

As for any long-term plans for
the Lampost, Goretzka has
ideas about expanding the
house to fit more members, and
wants to establish a solid finan-
cial basis for the house.

“We’re in good financial
shape and we’ve got lots of
generous friends,’’ Goretzka
said.

“I see only good things for our
future.”’

Computer helps paper writers

By BILL ROBERTS
Phi Staff Writer

Modern researchers no
longer wade through stacks of
indexes to find references to 4-
year-old articles, long outdated
by an inexorable flood of infor-
mation in today’s media.

Instead they take advantage
of the magical technology of our
microchip era by letting com-
puters do the wading.

The new way to do library
research for term papers and
theses is to use the ‘‘Dialog’’ In-
formation Services Inc., com-
puter to which the Washington
and Lee library has had access
since September of 1981.

Only those students in classes
specially designated by the pro-
fessor are given free access to
the computer. Others must pay
cash for the service. ;

The dialog system can search
through hundreds of thousands
of bibliographic references to
find articles on any specific
topic in less than ten minutes.
This task would take the tradi-
tional researcher weeks and
months.

To gain access to that infor-
mation, a university librarian
will call a telecommunications
“‘node,’’ or broadcast station, in
North Carolina, which then
bounces a signal off a satellite
to the computer in Palo Alto,
Calif.

Having secured a line of com-
munication to the Dialog com-
puter, the librarian simply con-
nects a Texas Instruments data
terminal to the telephone and
starts typing orders into the ter-
minal.

By giving the computer a few
key words, the user can search
for articles, essays, disserta-
tions and books on any desired
topic.

“Normally what someone
must do when he or she resear-
ches something is to have a
loose idea about their topic,”’
said Richard F. Grefe,
References and Public Services
Librarian. But with the Dialog
system, the topic must be
carefully defined, Grefe said.

The search method relies on a
variation of Boolean logic, the
process of combining a few key
words to focus on a subject.
Thus, given the key words
“Reagan administration” and
“Information leaks,’’ the com-
puter would compile two
bibliographic lists. A cross
reference between the two lists
would then produce a focused
set of references to articles con-
cerning information leaks in the
Reagan administration.

Topics need not be political.
References for the fields of
science technology, medicine,
business and law are all includ-
ed in the computer. In short, it
can provide references on any
topic that has ever been the sub-
ject of a publication.

That broad range of material
is the reason why the topic must
be carefully defined.

“We have to have the ques-
tion laid out in specific and
detailed form,’ Grefe said.
‘“‘We have to do this because,
One, it is a very expensive ser-
vice, we are charged by the
minute, and Two, the computer
is very stupid, it cannot guess
what you want,” he said.

Once the precise subject has
been given to the computer, and
a database chosen, the actual
search takes only a few
seconds.

A database is an organized
body of information stored in a
computer. The Dialog computer
has over 125 databases in its
memory. Typically, the data-
bases are compiled and updated
by independent firms and then
sold or leased to Dialog. One
such database is ‘‘Newsearch’’
which is leased to Dialog by the
Information Access Corpora-
tion of Los Altos, Calif. It costs
the user $95 per hour for access
to that information.

Newsearch includes all the
articles in three national news-
papers, 370 magazines, 660 law
journals and six law news-
papers. The Newsearch keeps
articles on file for 35 days and
then drops them into one of
three other databases, the Na-
tional Newspaper Index, the
Legal Resources Index, and the
Magazine index, also by RAC.

The advantage of computer
over traditional printed indexes
is one of immediacy. With the

computer, one can have the
references quickly and be sure
they are the most recent
available, where a printed in-
dex may be several months
behind. The Dialog system

eliminates that time lag.
The university allows each

professor to designate one
course above the 200 level for
free use of the Dialog system.
Every student in the designated
class is allowed one search on
the system. Some profesosors
have assigned term papers to
classes and given the students
the opportunity to use the
Dialog search as‘a tool for
developing a thorough and up-
to-date bibliography. But this is
only temporary.

‘Basically what we are say-
ing is these are the rules we are
going to play under, but we
reserve the right to change if we
get flooded,”’ Grefe said. ‘I do
not know of another undergrad-
uate college or university which
allows students to have search-
es done like this,”’ he said.

“Virtually every university
now has a system,” Grefe said.
There are three commercial
database systems offering
bibliographic searches for a
price. Dialog is the largest and
most powerful of these informa-
tion retrieval systems.

“After a while it may be the
only way to do research,” Grefe
said. “It is the wave of the
future.”’

An Angle of Vision

 

You and your new plant

By BETTY MUNGER

Buying a house plant is rather like coming home with a new baby.

There it is; bright, sparkling and all ours. Where to put it? Sun or
shade? What about drafts? How often should we feed it? Does it look ..
alittle pale? Ye gods, we're responsible for this living thing! _ i.

We make it through the first few days by hovering over it, by feel-.
ing the soil, dry or wet, and looking under the leaves for signs of ver:
min. We ask everyone we meet how their plants are getting along. ; .
We compare notes, suggestions and alternate methods of plant rais:

ing.

We finally turn to the printed word, to the Dr. Spocks of the plant, “y
world. There are all sorts of care — and feeding books — good ones —
—for us to learn from and to lean on. Books such as ‘‘House Plants for.
the Purple Thumb”’ and ‘‘Making Things Grow Indoors,” Two of the.
best books are “Greenworks’’ and ‘The Woman's Day Book of House.
Plants.” Gradually, we reach a more casual way of life with these
members of our household. We even forget about them for
hours/days at a time. They survive and so do we.

One day there appears — incredibly — a new leaf, a smile or a bud.
It’s all been well worth it and we puff with pride. Nobody tells us,
however, that before too long these wards of ours will grow leggy,
bushy and darn near take over the whole place.

Centre upsets W&L, snaps win streak

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Centre College upset the W&L
football team 34-21 last Satur-
day, handing the Generals their
first loss of the season and
breaking a seven game W&L
winning streak.

The loss evened W&L’s
season record at 1-1. W&L re-
mains 1-0 in the ODAC going in-
to this Saturday’s 1:30 matchup
with Randolph-Macon at Wilson
Field.

Against Centre, W&L jumped
out to a quick 7-0 lead at 6:49 of
the first quarter on senior Chris
Cavalline’s 2-yard run. Caval-
line lead the Generals with 65
yards rushing for the game.

Centre bounced back to take a
14-7 lead with a pair of second
quarter touchdowns. Mike Hall
hit Geoff Pope with a 44-yard
touchdown pass at 13:34 of the
period and Mike McGurn
scored on a 5-yard run with 58
seconds left in the half.

W&L narrowed the intermis-
sion deficit to 14-13 with some
last-second heroics. Junior Al
Paradise passed 35 yards to
sophomore Tom Wiser for a
touchdown as time expired. The
conversion failed.

Paradise had another strong
performance at quarterback for
the Generals, completing 16 of
32 passes for 193 yards.

“It doesn’t surprise me,”
stated W&L Coach Gary Fallon.

“Al really works toward
perfection. We hope that he’s

going to show improvement
every week,”’ Fallon said.

In the second half it was Cen-
tre quarterback Mike Hall who
dominated the game though.
Hall, who finished the game 16-
for-24, passing for 320 yards,
threw for two of Centre’s three
second half touchdowns.

The Generals lone second half
touchdown came on a 1-yard
run by sophomore Gene Girard
at 8:15 of the final period. A two-
point conversion on a pass from

Paradise to Girard got W&L to
within seven points at 28-21, but
that was as close as they would
get.

Centre snuffed out any hope
of a W&L comeback with a
touchdown of their own only 15
seconds after Girard’s score.
Hall hit Dave Block with a 76-
yard scoring pass.

W&L will face stiff competi-
tion from Randolph-Macon
when they try to run their
ODAC record to 2-0 Saturday.

Randolph-Macon comes into the
game with a perfect 3-0 record.
They own non-league wins over
Guilford, Iona, and West
Virginia Tech.

“This may be the most
talented backfield and offensive
team we face all year,” Fallon
pointed out. The Yellowjackets
are lead by quarterback An-
drew Tate and running backs
Gary Richins and Alan Spinney.

Fallon indicated that W&L
must try to control the ball by

mixing in both the run and the
pass. “We've got to keep away
from situations which dictate to
you one or the other,”’ he noted.

In addition to the facts that
the Generals will be coming off
a loss and it will be Homecom-
ing Weekend, W&L has another
reason to be fired up.

“We've never beaten them in
the five years I’ve been here. If
that isn’t enough frosting on the
cake, I don’t know how we can
sweeten it,’ Fallon stated.

Water polo recovers
with tournament title

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

Oh, what a difference a week
makes.

Two weeks ago, after W&L’s
“Fall Classic,’ head coach
Page Remillard found his water
polo team at a middling 3-2 with
problems in the team’s mental
game.

By last Sunday afternoon,
however, his Generals had
taken command of their game
— as well as everyone else’s

—to capture the ‘‘Generals’ In-
‘vitational’’ championship.

Finishing behind the
Generals were the Northern
Virginia Club at 4-1 for the
weekend, and Florida (3-2),
while George Washington,

UNC-Wilmington and Virginia
Commonwealth, all with 1-4
slates finished fourth, fifth and
sixth respectively in terms of
average goal difference.

W&L dominated the entire
tournament and brought their
overall season mark to 8-2.
“‘We’re real happy with the
mental aspect of our game,’’
asserted a contented Coach
Remillard. His satisfaction was
apparent as a_ noticeably
calmer mentor roamed pool-
side.

Remillard also noted that the
Generals had markedly de-
creased mistakes and, in turn,
were able to dictate play in

Generally Speaking

 

Sun doesn’t always shine

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi Sports Editor

It rained Sunday for the first
time in several weeks, and it
was perhaps appropriate. For
the first time in their last eight
contests, the Washington and
Lee football team lost a game.

The Generals had _ been
defeated by Centre College 34-21
at Centre on Saturday and the
campus mood Sunday was
gloomy. After all, everyone had
expected this to be the Gen-
erals’ season, and now they had
lost only their second game, and
a tough Randolph-Macon team
was to be in town for Homecom-
ing the following week.

However, the mood was far
from gloomy at Cy Twombly
pool in the depths of the Warner
gymnasium as one Washington
and Lee team was living up to
expectations, although not
many students knew about it.

The Washington and Lee
water polo team was busy
defeating the University of
North Carolina at Wilmington
21-9 and the University of

Florida 17-6 to capture the W&L
Invitational title for the second
year in a row.

The squad had only been able
to amass a 3-2 record the
previous week in the W&L “Fall
Classic.” Following wins over
Johns Hopkins, Monmouth and
Kenyon, the promising team
dropped contests to the Naval
Academy and (who else?) Slip-
pery Rock, the same team that
provided four of the Generals’
five losses last season.

Head coach Page Remillard,
understandably upset about his
team’s performance, never-
theless had to be pleased by the
fact that the other coaches at
the ‘Classic’? said that this
year’s version of the water polo
squad was better than last
year’s.

And the team showed some
improvement last weekend as
they had no problem in winning
all five games and capturing
their own invitational title.
However, they may still be just
a step away from putting it all
together for a great season,

every game. Another important
aspect of last week’s tourna-
ment was the building of team
depth as everyone on the squad
contributed to the Generals’
victory.

W&L got out to a fast start
Saturday morning as_ they
destroyed George Washington,
16-1. The Generals then pro-
ceeded to leave the rest of the
field floundering the frustrated
in Cy Twombly Pool. More
overwhelming victories were
the rest of the story as W&L
posted scores of 21-6, 15-7, 21-9,
and 17-6 over VCU, the North-
ern Virginia Club, UNC-
Wilmington and Florida respec-
tively.

Standouts for W&L included
Erik Peterson and fellow senior
Bob Marshall, along with
juniors Matt Ravencraft and
Rand McClain. The foursome
and the rest of the Generals con-
trolled play in their offensive
zone through effective passing,
while their defensive intensity
was awe-inspiring. Coupled
with fine goaltending from
Kevin Kadesky, this defense
allowed just 5.8 goals per game
for the tournament.

This weekend the Generals
head north to Pennsylvania
looking for revenge at the Slip-
pery Rock State Invitational.
Last weekend’s springboard
has the players emotionally
ready and some offensive hon-
ing this week could put the
Generals in position to return
the favor to the Rock.

Golfers place eleventh in

The fourth W&L-VMI Fall In-

awarded James Madison and
Old Dominion first place after
18 holes of play Saturday at the
Lexington Golf and Country
Club.

Sunday’s downpour ‘‘washed
out” the remaining 18 holes of
the 36-hole tournament, accord-

volved 20 teams, making this
year’s field of participants the
largest ever at the Invitational.

and, finally, a victory over Slip-
pery Rock, a school recently in
the limelight because the
Detroit Lions’ (of the NFL,
remember that?) starting full-
back, had star Billy Sims not
reported to camp, would have
been a rookie from that il-

lustrious school in Penn-
sylvania.
Washington and Lee lost only

one senior from last year’s 31-5
squad, Mike Bernot. However,
starting goalie Andy Gates did
not return to school this fall,
and senior Ken Johnstone left
the team to become president of
his fraternity.

After a few minor problems,
though, the Generals seemed to
have filled the gaps. Junior
Kevin Kadesky has stepped into
Gates’ shoes at the goalie spot,
and Remillard has a couple of
fine young field players to take
the place of Bernot and
Johnstone.

Matt Ravencraft, a junior
who worked hard over the sum-
mer at the National Junior
Development camp, has shown
an incredible amount of im-
provement and is among the:
squad’s scoring leaders. Also,
W&L appears to have recruited
a top-notch player in freshman
Tim Stanford, who has already
seen quite a bit of action.

With these additions, and the
return of all-Americans Erik
Peterson, Rand McClain, Tim
Rock and Don Smith, the
Generals have a shot at improv-
ing on last season’s record and
fifth-place finish in the NCAA
Eastern Championships.

“For this time of year it was a

could have played better,”’
Leslie said. Adding the fact that
W&L is one of the later starting
schools in the area, Leslie com-
mented that ‘‘a few of us (W&L

Crucial second-half goals by
freshman Bill Holmes and
senior Brad Poorman gave the
Washington and Lee soccer
team a 42 come-from-behind
victory over Haverford College
Sunday.

Despite an early first-half
goal by Holmes, the Generals,
now 1-0-1, fell behind 2-1 at the
beginning of the second half.
However, Holmes scored on an
assist from junior Ted Petrides,
and seniors Brad Poorman and
Tom Elder each tallied with
assists from freshman Steve
McGrath to provide the final
margin.

On Tuesday, Sept. 21, Wash-

teams were scoreless at the end
