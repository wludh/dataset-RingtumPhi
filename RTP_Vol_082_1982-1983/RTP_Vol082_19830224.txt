Judge calls for

new blood

Tilley sees lack
of credibility

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Phi News Editor

Dave Judge, the only student
to declare candidacy for stu-
dent body vice president at
Tuesday’s candidate debate,
called for new blood in student
government, saying that the EC
had become too much a self-
perpetuating body.

Citing this year as an exam-
ple, Judge said that traditional-

_ly those occupying the Big
Three positions have come from
within the EC.

Any student with the ‘desire

_ and perseverance” to do the job
can be effective, Judge said.

Judge, a junior, added that
what was designed to be a
student-run government has
begun to get away from the
students. He said students must
remember that revisions in the
governmental processes can be
initiated by those outside
government.

He said that his experience as
a dorm counselor this year has
shown him confusion within the
freshmen class about the honor
system and that an effort to
clear up that confusion is one of
the major challenges of the EC
next year.

The duties of the student body
vice-president are chiefly to
serve as informal treasurer of
the student body and also to
serve as technical adviser to
defendants in closed honor
hearings.

In reference to the budget,
Judge said that any student

A return of credibility to the
Executive Committee is the
major task for the 1983-84 EC in
the eyes of student body vice
presidential candidate Scott
Tilley.

Tilley, whose post-deadline
petition was excepted by the EC
last night, regards the recent
struggles on the part of the EC
in public honor trials as a detri-
ment to the credibility of the
student government.

Although he cites no specific
problems with the current EC
leadership, he said he feels that
student support for the honor
system has waned as a result of
the challenge to the EC in public
honor trials.

His objective as student body
vice-president, he said, would
be to find ways to return
authority to the EC in an effort
to reestablish the student sup-
port for the honor system.

One of the responsibilities of
the EC vice-president is to be
technical advisor in closed
honor hearings with a deep
familiarity with the White
Book, the EC’s constitution.

Tilley said that he would
stress a close look at the codes
in the White Book to find ways
of raising the EC’s credibilty.

Tilley, a sophomore, has serv-
ed otherwise as acting presi-
dent of the College Republicans,
Features Editor of the Ring-
tum Phi, and is a member of the
InverVarsity Christian
Fellowship.

t Howard

lone
secretary

candidate

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

Better student orientation to
the honor system and percen-
tage allotments for organiza-
tions are goals of Len Howard,
junior, candidate for Executive
Committee secretary.

Howard, the only declared
candidate for the office,
presented his ideas at the “Big
Three” forum Tuesday after-
noon.

“T’ve heard some disturbing
comments this year from fresh-
men that make me wonder if
they understand what the honor
system is all about,”’ Howard
said.

He proposed to investigate
the possibility of staging a mock
honor hearing at freshman
orientation and wants a more
comprehensive honor orienta-
tion for first year law students.
According to Howard, students
coming to Washington and Lee
don’t completely understand
the honor system.

“TI came to W&L because of
the honor system. It could be a
big drawing card for students,”’
commented Howard, who is ser-
ving on the White Book revi-
sions committee as well as the
Student Recruitment Commit-
tee and the Student Activities
Board.

In order to alleviate
budgetary problems, Howard
proposed that there be a preset
formula based on the number of
students benefitted by each
organization. This percentage

The honor code and the
budget are the two main issues
facing the four candidates for
Executive Committee president
this year.

The four candidates, Bob
Jenevein, Markham Pyle, Mike

we Singer, and Gov Slahor, met
jwith members of the student

body and answered questions
concerning the issues.

Markham Pyle has been in
charge of finances for the
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance and is currently on the
White Book Revisions Commit-
tee. Pyle said that there has
been an increase in legalism
concerning the honor system
and that honor trials had
become courts of law rather
than courts of fact.

When asked about the grow-
ing number of clubs asking the
EC for funds, Pyle replied,
‘“You’re going to have to look at
(the club’s) purpose. There
comes a point when you're go-
ing to have to sharpen the hat-
chet.”

Regarding the separation of
the law and undergraduate
campuses, Pyle said that he
understood that General Lee
had intended that the two
schools coexist. ‘‘We have a lot
to gain from this interming]l-
ing,’’ Pyle said.

Gov Slahor referred to
several business ventures as
showing his qualifications but
refused to elaborate on them
when pressed as to their

Four candidates vie

specific nature.

Slahor said that he thought
the EC should be more open-
minded in its honor-related ac-
tivities and listed things he
hoped to accomplish should he
be elected.

—More low-interest loans to
fraternities,

—attempt to gain direct ac-
cess to alumni funds,

—solve campus parking pro-
blems,

—and, create a commission
comprised of townspeople, the
police department, and frater-
nities to work out any problems.

Slahor emphasized that he
hoped the use of alumni funds
would increase the number of
clubs receiving money from the
EC. Slahor hopes to run the ad-
ministrative side of the EC as a
business.

Mike Singer is the only can-
didate with hands-on EC ex-
perience, having served as
secretary this year.

Singer said that he believed
the EC has been and will con-
tinue to be effective. Just as he
did last year, Singer is em-
phasizing communications as
an answer to many campus pro-
blems. Improved communica-
tion will lessen the gap between
the law and undergraduate
campuses according to Singer.

When the discussion centered
on student apathy and the lack
of participation in elections and
other EC events, Singer said,

‘Apathy is going to be
wherever student government

Editorial :

EC at midterm:
a critical assessment

By RICK SWAGLER
Phi News Editor

The first half of the year is the
busiest for the Executive com-
mittee. The EC allocates stu-
dent funds, works out beginning
of the year problems, and this
year reviewed proposed cur-
riculum requirements.

After covering the EC for the
last four months, I have review-
ed my notes and written this
fair — if not complementary —
evaluation of their performance
as individuals and as a whole.

The Big Three:
Mike Singer, Morgan Griffith
and Bennett Ross

Junior Mike Singer was
elected secretary of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. His most
visible duties are keeping the
minutes of the meetings and
publicizing EC events. A less
explicit aspect of his job as a
member of the Big Three is to
help President Bennett Ross
and Vice President Morgan
Griffith in presenting an aura of
leadership. Griffith does this ef-
fectively and has an air of
authority about him. Singer,
however, has failed. Part of the
problem may be that this is
Singer’s first year on the com-
mittee. Nevertheless,
sometimes it seems like Singer
is speaking just to speak and not
really thinking about what he is
saying. During a discussion on
curriculum requirements
Singer said, “I think they’re
favoring the arts over the social
sciences, and I think that is
favoritism.” Tautological com-

Letters:

No alcohol at
Glen Maury

A Letter to the Student Body:

The W&L lacrosse program
has been very fortunate to have
the use of Glen Maury Park in
Buena Vista for practices and
games.

Our field facilities are often
under water, snow, ice, or mud
in February and early March
and Glen Maury is dry at the
same time. Without the use of
this field our program would be
hard pressed to accomplish
anything practicing in the gym.

We appeal to you, our
students, to abide by the no
alcohol ordinance endorsed by
Buena Vista when you attend
games at Glen Maury. I am
sure that any problems with
alcohol will terminate our
association with Buena Vista
and their park.

We need their facility to be
successful, and Buena Vista
does not need us. They are

ments like this are un-
necessary.

Only in the intangible aspects
of the job has Singer failed. He
has done a good job of keeping
minutes and publicizing EC ac-
tivities and subcommittee ap-
pointments.

Vice president Morgan Grif-
fith, a third-year law student is
one of the several thoughtful
members of the committee.
This pensive attitude produces
exacting and incisive com-
ments concerning the matters
before the committee.

When the committee was
arguing over the specific cur-
riculum requirements as pro-
posed by the faculty executive
committee, Griffith suggested
that the committee vote on the
theory of the proposal rather
than wallow in the numbers of
credits. This put the committee
on a more direct and fruitful
track.

Commenting on the frater-
nities’ need for Contact, Griffith
said, ‘“‘What else do they (the
fraternities) do besides pick up
their trash? This is good PR for
them.”

As vice president, Griffith is
in charge of keeping up with the
funds of the various campus
organizations. He has been
eager to work with organiza-
tions whose books do not jibe
with the university computer
account records.

Griffith has done an excellent
job so far and has aided Ross in

simply doing us a favor without
really getting anything in
return, Any problems, and I’m
sure they will decide to close the
park to our use.

Please help us show our ap-
preciation by leaving the
alcohol and beer at home.
Thank you.

Sincerely,
Jack Emmer, Staff
and Team

To The Editor:

I hope that the students of

President Bennett Ross has
been a confident leader through
his first four-and-a-half months
in office. This attitude was pro-
bably best conveyed in a com-
ment he made during the
debate over the Fancy Dress
Weekend date. Before the com-
mittee voted to have the event
on the scheduled weekend, Ross
said, ‘‘I know we’ll make the
right decision.”

His confidence has some-
times bordered on stubborness,
however. At one point after the
voting on a specific curriculum
requirement, Ross told the com-
mittee that they had made a
“terrible mistake.”

For the most part, Ross has
been open-minded and cautious.
He has not hesitated to table a
motion until student opinion has
been ascertained. He has also
kept a watchful eye on the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty and was instrumental in set-

ting up the liaison between Con-
tact and SABU. SABU has so far
not taken advantage of this op-
portunity. Ross recognized that
W&L’s black population is being
neglected and that there was a
need for a committment to this
group of students.

Ross has done a good job so

' far this year and it is apparent

that he is working to find a
balance between confidence
and stubborness.

eThe Law Reps:
Ken Terwilleger and John
Sicilian

Terwilleger and Sicilian com-
prise the law delegation to the
committee. Both are ‘staunch
advocates of ‘Law School
rights.”” Sicilian, though, has
been less vocal perhaps
because this is his first year.
But he has not hesitated to
speak his mind when sure of his
ground.

Terwilleger has advocated a
closer relationship between the
law and undergraduate cam-

puses. Terwilleger transferred
to W&L for undergraduate work
before going on to W&L law.

During the budget hearings,
Terwilleger said, “If there’s a
chasm, let’s not say to hell with
it. Let’s not pull the rug out
from under one side of the cam-
pus.”

The Senior Reps:
John Vlahoplus and Pete
Baumgaertner

Arguing honor trials for the
EC has taught John Vlahoplus
that he doesn’t want to practice —
trial law. Vlahoplus is perhaps
one of the most argumentative
members of the committee and
is aided by a sharp mind and
logical, thorough reasoning.

Though he sometimes ap-
pears inattentive, he rarely
fails‘ to make a helpful com-
ment.

Baumgaertner, on the other
hand, is quieter — especially for
a senior. So far this year he-has
appeared to represent the

EC hears SAB report

By G. BRUCE POTTER
Phi EC Correspondent

“A few surprises’’ will be in
store for students and alumni
attending next weekend’s Fan-
cy Dress Ball, according to Stu-
dent Activities Board Chairman
Lanier Edge.

Edge was presenting the
SAB’s financial report to the
Executive Committee at their
regular meeting Monday night.
He was joined by represen-
tatives of SABU, the Mock Con-
vention and even the EC itself.

Nearly 200 of the 1,085 T-
shirts ordered had been sold on
the first day of their availabili-
ty, according to Edge. Tickets
for the ball, grain cups and
posters will go on sale next
week. However, about 100 alum-
ni have already purchased
tickets at an expected profit of
$2,500,

Two bands will be on the
agenda Thursday night in
Evans Dining Hall to kick off
the weekend. Edge said that
Dean John would not give his
approval to holding that party
at Zollman’s Pavilion because
of the problems involved with

budget report. The committee
only has $915 left in its funding
account and $862 left in its ex-
penses allocation. They do have
areserve of $3,500.

The two public honor hear-

. ings have “‘inflated’’ the prin-

ting and supplies costs, accord-
ing to Griffith, who said, ‘‘If we
have another public honor hear-
ing, we’re in the red.”’

' It was exactly that worry that
caused the EC to chop down the
International Club’s request for
$300 to help with International
day Sunday.

Henry Baey, president of the
club, indicated that Interna-
tional Day would cost $735, in-
cluding $455 for a group of folk
dancers from James Madison
University. Baey indicated that
he could get some financial help
from the Dean of Students of-
fice, but he said, ‘‘What a club
can do should not be limited by
the amount of money it is giveh
by the EC.”’

Baey’s request was reduced

because, as Griffith put it
“They knew about. Interna-
because, as Griffith put it,
“they knew about Interna-
tional Day at the beginning of
the year” when original budget
requests were made.

Law school Representative
Ken Terwilleger encouraged
Baey ‘‘to look elsewhere’’ for
funds, and President Bennett
Ross said, ‘I don’t. think they
should rely on the EC to fund In-
ternational Day so they can

have money left over after-
wards.”

The committee voted 7-4 to
allot $150 for International Day.
Griffith, Terwilleger,
sophomore’ Representative
Dave Jonson and freshman
Representative Steve Connett
voted against the motion.

Junior representative Scott
Mason suggested that the EC
look into getting a ‘blanket
school policy”’ on the reschedul-
ing of exams. Mason’s proposal

   

would not allow students to

- change the time of an exam
_ after the Friday preceding the

exam period, except in emer-
gencies.

Mason and senior represen-
tative Pete Baumgaertner will
serve on a subcommittee to
study the idea. The motion to
form that subcommittee passed
83 with junior representative
Ted McQuiston, Terwilleger
and senior representative John
Viahoplus opposed.

that the SABU Ball would be

(continued from page 2)

Athletic lobby on the commit-
tee. He first asked that athletes
who would miss Fancy Dress
because of scheduling be given
a monetary allowance, and
later he called for safer equip-
ment in the weight room.

Baumgaertner has been a
good, though not outstanding,
member of the EC and has a
good rapport with the students
he represents.
eThe Junior Reps:

Scott Mason and Ted McQuiston

As a journalism major, Scott
Mason is aware of how the
public perceives the EC’s ac-
tions. Perhaps it was this
awareness that prompted him
to comment that it ‘looks bet-
ter’ to have the budget hear-
ings on two nights.

Though he is quiet at
meetings, he is not without ac-
complishment. He and soph-
omore representative Dave

Jonson succeeded in having the
drip/add fee reduced from $10

to $5.
To be a more effective
representative, Mason needs to

WHITE FRONT

speak up more in meetings.
Silence limits the committee’s
knowledge of student opinion.
Ted McQuiston is not afraid to
let other members know how he

feels and as a result is the more -

outspoken of the junior repre-
sentatives. This may be in part
due to his experience as an EC
member last year.

During the discussion of the
FD date, McQuiston said, ‘‘I’d
feel uneasy casting my vote on
what I’ve heard tonight.”’

McQuiston has also worked
hard in researching the
feasability of student identifica-
tion cards with photographs.

During budget hearings, both
of McQuiston’s. motions for
allocations — $1200 to the Inter-
national Club and $500 to the
Outing Club — were each cut
$100. This and a suggestion that
student taxes might need to be
raised more than the proposed
$5 to accommodate Mock Con-
vention betrayed a generosity
not characteristic of a money-
tight EC. :
eThe Sophomore Reps:

Dave Jonson and Darby Brower

Regarding their perfor-

mances so far on the EC, Jon-
son and Brower are at opposite
ends of the spectrum.

Jonson has apparently had
trouble in keeping up with the
business at hand. During the
budget hearings, he spent time
drawing Mercedes-Benz
emblems on his note pad while
clubs were making requests.

During the discussion of a let-
ter the EC was preparing to
send to the faculty concerning
the curriculum, Jonson asked
that the spelling of a word be
corrected, not knowing that the
entire sentence had been taken
out of the letter several minutes
earlier.

When Kevin Kelley, soph-
omore class president, asked
the committee for a loan to
cover expenses for the
sophomore class Homecoming
party until revenues came in,
Jonson suggested that the
money be invested. This oc-
cured about two weeks before
Homecoming. Jonson said he
thought Kelley was referring to
the Fancy Dress party.

Jonson, however, teamed up
with Mason in the successful

Jonson rarely speaks, and
when he does one never knows
what to expect. The sophomore
class needs a more attentive
and vocal representative.

Darby Brower is an especial-
ly vocal and_ hard-working
member considering this is just
his first year as a represen-
tative. Brower has a_ dog-
gedness about him that is con-
sistently brought out in his work
for the committee. Whether he
is helping organize the alcohol
awareness week or questioning
a committee chairman, Brower
is thorough.

Most evident, though, is his
desire to keep the committee
from straying from the subject.
Brower’s arguments are to the
point and consequently, he
wants the committee’s to be
direct also. This is the type of
leader the EC will look to in the
future.

The Freshman Rep:
Steve Connett

Steve Connett is in the same
position as John Sicilian: who’s
learning on the job. So far, Con-
nett has not been afraid to take
responsibility. He investigated
a complaint regarding the laun-
dry facilities in the freshman
dorm and reported his findings
to the committee earlier this
term. While laundry room in-
vestigations may seem minor,

keep in mind that Connett is on-
ly a freshman and is just learn-
ing the ropes. Although it is too
early to guess at his potential,
he is certainly a member to
watch.

Overview

As a whole, the EC has been
moderately effective. The
drop/add fee reduction, the
organization for monthly
reports and the general. high
caliber of the _ individual
members have been signs of a
good EC. The picture, though, is
not completely bright.

Just as something was miss-
ing from last year’s EC,
something is missing from this
year’s. It can probably be trac-
ed to decorum. Perhaps Ross is
leery of appearing heavy-
handed. Whatever the cause,
too many individual conversa-
tions take place during the
meetings and it appears that
the committee is sometimes
less than interested. This is not
to say that the EC room is no
place for friendly humor. The
Calyx for example has reported
to the EC several times on the
status of the ‘Calyx stretch
limousine.”’

In a word, Ross needs to exer-
cise more control. Diversity of
committee members can be a
virtue, but it can also make the
group unmanageable when
business is at hand. Internal
control will be the key for the
remainder of the year.

Economist to speak
in Lee Chapel

Van Doorn Ooms, chief
economist for the U.S. House of
Representatives Budget Com-
mittee, will be the principal
speaker for the annual Phi Beta
Kappa Convocation at
Washington and Lee University
on Tuesday, March 1, in Lee

Law students offer tax help

Seventeen Washington and

will provide free income tax
preparation assistance to
Rockbridge County residents
beginning Saturday, February
19.

The Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance (VITA) program is
sponsored by the Taxpayer
Assistance Division of the Inter-
nal Revenue Service.

According to Alan Munro, a
third-year W&L law student
who initiated the VITA program
in Lexington last year, the ser-

vice is designed for taxpayers
whose annual income was in the
general range of $10,000 or less
for individual returns or $15,000
or less for joint returns.

Munro indicated’ that
volunteers will be available to
answer questions about general
tax matters not specifically
related to the tax return.

Those taxpayers who wish to
take advantage of the VITA ser-
vice must bring all W-2 forms
with them. If they have been
receiving unemployment com-
pensation, the taxpayers should
bring their 1099-UC forms. Par-

Cagers host ODAC game

By ANDY HOPPES
Phi Staff Writer

Despite losing two of its final
three Old Dominion Athletic
Conference games, the Wash-
ington and Lee basketball team
earned the right to host a
quarterfinal game of ODAC
tournament tonight.

W&L defeated Eastern Men-
nonite College last week, but
lost league games against
Roanoke and Maryville and a
non-league game_ against
Shenandoah College to finish
the regular season with a 9-7
record in the ODAC and an
overall mark of. 16-9. The
Generals are seeded fourth in
the eight team ODAC tourna-
ment.

“I feel good that we are play-
ing up here, but I don’t feel good
that we are playing Maryville,”
stated W&L Coach Verne Can-
field.

“This is the time of year when
basketball is a mental game,”’
Canfield said. ‘‘It would be un-
wise to think that just because it
is ahome game we are going to
win this,’’ Canfield stated con-
cerning the Maryville game.

W&L’s regular season-ending
four game road trip began on a
sour note with an 82-66 loss to
Shenandoah College on Feb. 10.
The Generals held a 36-28 lead
at halftime, but Shenandoah
outscored W&L 21-2 over a 13-
minute stretch of the second
half to claim the victory.

Senior Brian Hanson led the
Generals in scoring with 20
points. Junior John Lee Graves
and senior Frank Eppes both
tossed in 14 points.

Second-ranked nationally
Roanoke College defeated the
Generals 106-88 to sweep the
regular season series with
W&L.

40-18 lead with six minutes to
play in the first half. However,
W&L outscored the Maroons
19-7 in the closing minutes of the
half to narrow the halftime
deficit to 47-37.

W&L pulled to within four
points on three occassions in the
second half, but the Maroons
never let the Generals get any
closer than that.

Hanson led W&L with 25
points. Junior Billy Yates added
17 points, Graves 16 points, and
Eppes 15 points.

“Right now the ODAC is a
two-fold conference,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘You’ve got Roanoke on
one hand, and the other eight
teams on the other hand,”’
stated Canfield about
Roanoke’s dominance of the
league.

W&L rebounded to edge
Eastern Mennonite 73-71 in a
crucial contest last Tuesay in
Harrisonburg.

W&L held a precarious 73-68
lead with 35 seconds left after
Graves hit a basket for the
Generals. Mennonite closed to
within two points on a three-
point basket, but missed two
shots in the closing seconds that
could have sent the game into
overtime.

Hanson again led the
Generals with 19 points. Frank
Eppes tossed in 14 points, and
Yates and sophomore David
Wilkinson both added 10 points.

per game, and is currently eighth among W&L career scoring
leaders at 1319 points. (photo by Darryl Woodson)

 

W&L ended its regular season
on a losing note Friday when
the Generals lost 67-66 to
Maryville on a last second

Swimmers sparkle at invitational

By MIKE STACHURA
Phi Staff Writer

After months of watching his
Generals improve, fourth-year
head coach Page Remillard got
what he termed a ‘“mega-
surprise’ as the W&L swim
team turned in fine perfor-
mance on top of fine perfor-
mance at the Seahawk Invita-
tional in Wilmington, North
Carolina.

Led by junior Gary Meyer
and freshman John Moody, the
Generals qualified for nationals
in four events. Meyer and
Moody made the time in the 50-
free and 100-fly, respectively.
The two then teamed with
sophomore Bobby Pearson and
freshman Tim Stanford to
qualify in both the 400- and 800-
free relays.

“They made it happen. If it
continues it will be what they
desire and what I expect,’’ said
Remillard, reflecting on last
weekend’s performances. He
had a noticeable smile as he

made his rounds at Tuesday
afternoon’s workout.

Freshman Moody had an ex-
cellent weekend in Wilmington,
qualifying for nationals in three
events, breaking a_ school
record in one and coming up
just shy of another school mark.
His 100-fly effort was faster
than classmate Stanford’s
record breaking performance
in December by .42 seconds.

‘“‘He’s been a very reliable
man this season and now he has
the rest of the team started
toward those national qualify-
ing times. He may just be the in-
troduction to what could happen
this weekend,” praised Coach
Remillard.

The team is looking to make
those times this weekend in
Blacksburg at the Virginia
Senior Championships. It’s
been a team effort as can be
seen in the practices and the
competitions, and now that
they’ve seen the hard work pay
off, Remillard and his swim-
mers want more.

‘“‘We want everyone to get
their lifetime best times and for
many that will qualify them for
nationals,” stated the Generals’
mentor.

“‘We’ll go faster this weekend
because of what we did last
weekend. The guys that are
close to their qualifying times
now are going to go faster,”
continued Remillard.

Other swimmers with com-
mendable performances in
Wilmington were junior captain
Tim Rock and freshman David
Lewis. Rock is closing in on the
NCAA standard times in the 400
IM and the 1,650-yard free.
Lewis has risen above his early
season difficulties to chop 24
seconds off his 100-yard free-
style time.

The Generals begin action
Friday in the three-day, 18-
event Virginia mune Cham-
pionships.

Lacrosse team ready

By JOHN HARRISON
Phi Staff Writer

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team will open its 12-
game schedule, which includes
eight home games and an ex-
hibition game, this Wednesday
when it takes on Duke Universi-
ty at 3 p.m. on Wilson Field. The
Generals defeated Duke in
Durham, 12-6, last season as
Geoff Wood led W&L with four
goals.

W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer said that the Blue Devils,
who finished last year with a
record of 6-7, are a young team
with only a few juniors and
seniors.

“They have a pretty good
group of freshmen,’’ said Em-
mer. “They might be ahead of
us in the number of games
they’ve had. Since their season
is over before most other
teams, they start practicing
right after the first of the year.
That puts them slightly ahead
of us,”’ he noted.

Emmer said he has not set a
lineup to start against Duke yet,
but said he was pleased with the
work of several players. last

week when the squad practiced
in Florida.

“Kevin Walakovits, John But-
tarazzi and Barry Waterman
have shown encouraging signs’”’
at midfield, said Emmer.

On attack, he mentioned
Geoff Wood, Lee Heimert, Joe
Seifert and Jeff Mason. “Rod
Santomassimo has done a good
job, also,” he said.

In goal, Emmer said that ex-
perience from last season gives
Phil Aiken an edge over Mark
Lukes,

“John DiDuro has looked
good there,”’ as well, the coach
observed.

On defense, Emmer said he
will be relying first on veterans

“It’s nice to come back from

he remarked.
