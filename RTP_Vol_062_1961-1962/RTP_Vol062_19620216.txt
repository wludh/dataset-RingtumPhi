Fourteen W&L Professors
Get Glenn Grants For ’62

University funds totaling $5,205 have been granted to 14
Washington and Lee professors for support of reasearch and

study projects during 1962.

The awards, supported by the*
John M. Glenn Foundation at the
university, were announced today
by William W. Pusey, II. Individual
stipends this year range from $46
to $900.

The Glenn grants are part of a
Washington and Lee program de-
signed to promote continuing schol-
arship among faculty members and
increasing teaching effectiveness in
classrooms and laboratories.

Established in 1953, the program
is supported through a $120,000 gift
from the late philanthropist, John
M. Glenn. He was an official of the
Russell Sage Foundation and a
member of the class of 1879 at
Washington and Lee. Prior to the
Glenn program, a $25,000 grant from
the Carnegie Foundation was used
to promote faculty scholarship from
1951 to 1953.

Most of the faculty recipients will
conduct their research during this
summer’s vacation, but they have
until December 1 to complete their
work. The 1962 Grants so far:

Dr. C. Westbrook Barritt, Spanish,
for study in Santander, Spain, to
improve his competence in Spanish
and Basque.

Gore Speaks Out on Katangan,
Communist Influence in Congo

province apart from the other five
in the Congo, Gore replied that the
time has come for the province to
be reconciled with the central gov-
ernment, and that the recent agree-
ment of Katona, if kept, will ac-
complish the reconciliation.

Congo A National Unit

The Congo, he said, has been a
natural unit as a colony, and should
continue united as a nation. This
view is presently endorsed by the
Belgian, British, and United States
governments, as well as the UN.

Gore said that Congolese Prime
Minister Adoula, during a recent
Washington visit, stated two re-
quirements for the reconciliation of
Leopoldville with the secessionist
provinces: parliamentary negotiation
in the capitol, and a constitutional
arrangement.

The Senator said that he had
spoken to Adoula about using the
talents of Tshombe in the central
government, since leadership in the
Congra is at a premium; Adoula re-
plied that if Tshombe wanted it, he
could have a Federal cabinet posi-
tion.

The Present Chaos

To a question as to who stood to
gain from chaotic conditions in the
Congo, Gore answered that “Com-
munism thrives on chaos.” He said
that the Soviet Union would like to
see the United Nations fail in the
Congo.

In spite of Communist efforts,
Gore called the Congo “the only
major diplomatic victory we’ve won
in ten years.” He said the USS. is
“winning the fight for sub-Sahara
Africa. Why lose it now?”

The Senator emphatically stated
that Communist leadership in the
Congo is exaggerated. Africans as a
rule, he said, do not have sufficient
sophistication for ideological devo-
tion to Communism.

To back up this opinion, Gore rea-
soned that African tribal ties are
much stronger thatn the abstract
appeal of ideology. The tribal or-
ganization, he said, is essentially
democratic and acts as an impedi-
ment to Communism. Gore ex-
plained that in Africa the Com-
munists have sought domination
through selected leaders, not
through conversion of the masses.
However, he said, the “extremely
small minority” of educated Com-
munists which is the Soviet hope,
is almost non-existant.

U.S. vs. U.S.S.R.

Asked whether he thought the
U.S. were equipped to handle Rus-
sia, Gore replied: “I think we're
the strongest military power in the
world.” He described U.S. military
might as just “coming to fruition”
since the disarmament after World
War II. He pointed to US. strength
in missile subs.

After the conference cheerful
Gore summarized his hopes for the
U.N. in the Congo: “The UN and the
U.S. standing together can bring
effective self-government to the
Congo, as well as hold off any for-
eign threat.”

Senator Gore was the principal
speaker in W&L’s eighth annual In-
ternational Relations Week. He
called the UN action in the Congo
greatest defeat that Khrush-
chev has suffered in a decade.”

former secretary to a
member of the Indian parliament,
credited UN effectiveness to the late
Dag Hammerskjold and to the evo-
lution of the UN Secretariat into an
executive arm.

The USSR, said Nawaz, has
“abused the veto power” in the UN
Security Council in order “to re-
duce the effectiveness of the Unit-
ed Nations to solve world prob-
lems.” But the Soviets have not
proved capable of stopping UN op-
erations to date, he said.

Although the Security Council is
crippled by the Soviet veto, Nawaz
said, the General Assembly has been
able to act separately. The newly-
developed executive power of the
Secretariat he called a Soviet de-
feat.

The UN in the Congo

The Indian said that “Congo op-
erations proved” that the Secretary-
General is not merely an adminis-
trator. In an obvious reference to
the USSR, he said the success of the
Secretary-General’s actions “irritat-
ed at least one power” to the point
of trying to “remove him.”

Though Nawaz favored executive
power for the UN, he said that the
acknowledgement of the Secretary-
General as a chief executive “would
prove a costly mistake,” the Sec-
retary-General must remain in the
capacity of an “executive function-
ary.” Thus will the UN be able to
exercise “its primary function,” to
“maintain world peace.”

Nawaz said that the United States
has the “major responsibility for
sharing the fate” of the UN. The
sacrifices which must be made “for
the cause of the UN” are not big in
terms of money, he said; Ameri-
cans must not feel that they are
paying too much. He called the UN
bond issue “a compliment to your
charitable dispositions.”

Not a World Government

The UN, said Nawaz, is not a
world government; rather, it merely
provides “a frame of reference” for
the settlement of international prob-
lems. In this capacity, he called the
organization a success.

He said the major obstacles to con-
tinued progress for the UN are the
Security Council veto power and the
“frame of mind” of people today.
Saying that the UN is “a new hu-
man experiment,” he asked for “a
bold frame of mind” in dealing with
it. He said that men must think not
merely of objectives or of dangers
in the processes of the UN; they
must “realize that humanity has
come to the point of organizing a
world community.”

The Goa Question

 

In a questioning period after his
speech, Nawaz answered querries
both on the UN and on his native
country. The first question was “Did
India act in accordance with UN
principles in seizing Goa?” Nawaz
admitted that India “abdicated its
own policy” to the extent of using
foree when it took Goa. But he
asked the audience to consider that
the dispute had reached a point at
which it would respond to nothing
except force.

Facing The Facts

Realizing that we are putting ourselves in a precarious po-
sition, we would like to comment on the proposed amendment
to the Student Body Constitution which would eliminate the
representative of the Publications Board from the executive
committee.

Those who argue for the elimination of the Publications
Board representative claim that the position is not an elected
one, and that the presence of a non-elected member on the EC
is a violation of the democratic principles on which the W&L
student government is based. The Publications Board commit-
teeman, they say, does not represent a significant portion of
the student body, and therefore should not be allowed a place
in student government.

We feel, however, that those who form their arguments
solely on the basis of democratic principles are laboring under
an illusion. Washington & Lee is not a model democratic com-
munity, and never will be. Those who hope for year-round
student body interest in student government are simply not
facing the facts. Our student government depends almost en-
tirely on the integrity of the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, and not on student participation.

The representative from the Publications Board is almost
inevitably an individual of integrity and talent. He has shown
interest, ability, and responsibility to be chosen to edit one of
the school publications. He is necessarily abreast of student af-
fairs. We think it would be sheer folly to deny such a person
an important place in student government.

The Student Control Committee

Howard Slater in his column today makes a plea for a posi-

tive ideal of gentlemanly conduct. He hopes that the Student
Control Committee will play an important role in the move
away from what Mr. Slater believes to be the present negative
nature of student discipline.
, Weare all for a positive concept of conduct and we hope that
the Student Control Committee will foster such an ideal. One
of the major ways it can do so is by arousing student concern
for the amount of ungentlemanly behavior that goes on here.
If the flurry of letters-to-the-editor and comments that have
greeted the Control Committee’s first actions is an indication
of aroused interest, the Committee is already well on its way to
a positive goal.

The Basketball Controversy

Tuesday columnist Thorns Craven joined our sports
editor, Steve Henry, this week as charter members of the
Washington and Lee Athletic Supporters Club.Belying its
name, but acting like the usual boosters club, these two worth-
ies find very little to support in our present basketball team.
Indeed, the performances of the team have been horrendous
at times this year.

Their criticisms have, however, drawn some rather sharp
comments from the team’s members and supporters. We’re
afraid we don’t know enough about the game to discuss the
technical aspects of the various attacks and counterattacks in-
telligently, but we are very interested in certain questions of
school spirit and athletic policy that have been implicit in the
controversy.

People who say that the criticisms may be true but should
never have been uttered are wrong in one respect and right in
another.

They are right in contending that our non-subsidized athlet-
ic policy is here to provide recreation and not entertainment
for the student body. (Most students have expressed their
opinion of the entertainment value of basketball here by stay-
ing away from the games.) Anyone who thinks that he should
be provided a Saturday night spectacle, courtesy of the athletic
department, should have gone to Duke. They’ll never get it
here. The defenders of the team are further correct in saying
to the critics ‘Well, why don’t you get out there and do bet-
ter?” Everyone at Washington and Lee has an opportunity to
make a varsity team, if they want to badly enough. There are
no paid gladiators here to take the spot that should be theirs.

The defenders are wrong, however, in implying that no
one has a right to criticize the team. We think that it is the re-
sponsibility of the student newspaper to tell what is going on
at W&L. This involves answering the big question in all sports
reporting—Just how good are they? Too many athletes are
their own psychoanalysts,, deciding what is good and bad for
their “mental attitude.” In truth, no athlete has any answer
for his critics but to prove in competition that he is better than
they said he was.

The basketball team under Coach McHenry (whom we
believe to be both a gentleman and a fine coach) , despite some
grumbling, seem to have tried very hard this year. We still en-
joy watching them play and feel that more people would en-
joy their games than now attend them. They have our every
best wish for better performances in the future. But despite
our opinions as editors we see no reason why the criticism
should be called off. We find it on the whole to be a healthy
sign of student concern for our intercollegiate teams. Some
people here care very much whether “we” win or lose.

An Interview With President Cole...

 

Washington & Lee’s Position

On Federal Aid To Education

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“Healthy” was the term Univer-
sity President Dr. Fred C. Cole used
to describe Washington and Lee’s
financial independence from the
government,

Discussing the over-all policy of
the school concerning federal aid
to education, President Cole said
that the policy of the board of trus-
tees indicates that they will not ac-
cept general federal aid.

Declaring that “Washington and
Lee is better off” financially than
many schools, President Cole said,
“We have opportunities here for
getting most of what we need.”

He feels that schools that can
function adequately without the use
of federal funds should do so. How-
ever, he added that some schools
cannot do what they are called on
to do without outside financial help.

“If we find ourselves unable to
provide the students with what they
need here, then we might be impel-
led to participate in some of the
government’s programs,” he said.

Before coming to Washington and
Lee, President Cole was affiliated
with Tulane University in New Or-
leans, La. Tulane does accept sub-

 

stantial government funds. Does
Dr. Cole feel that that university
has been hurt by federal assistance?
“No,” he said. “Of course, I can-
not say that it will or will not affect
Tulane adversely in the future. Tu-
lane had no choice, however, if it
was to serve the region as it should.
Private support was inadequate.”

What are some of the possible ill
effects of federal aid?

According to Dr. Cole, the same
two dangers that have always been
associated with a paternalistic gov-
ernment prevail in the aid-to-edu-
cation problem. He cited the possi-
bility of limiting controls being ex-
ercised by the government, and he
said that with federal support a
school “may tend to rely more on
the government than on itself.”

While Washington and Lee con-
tinues to maintain its independence
financially, both scholarship and
loan programs to students are be-
ing expanded. New buildings are
being added, and other improve-
ments obviously requiring substan-
tial money are being instituted in
the school. Last year the Ring-tum
Phi said one in five students at
Washington and Lee received finan-

cial aid. As signs of physical ex-
pansion, we see the new dormitories
and the science buildings being
constructed. Where does the money
for these programs come from?

Primarily, Washingtgon and Lee’s
financial support comes from five
areas: endowment funds, grants from
foundations, business, and friends of
the University, student tuition fees,
an alumni fund, and a parents’ fund.
These sources seem to promise for
the future adequate maintenance of
the university as a high calibre in-
stitution.

We are doing all right without
general federal support, and except
for some specialized research and
training done in the national inter-
est, the board of trustees wants to
keep it that way.

“Washington and Lee is fortun-
ate,” President Cole said. “We are
getting along without federal sub-
sidy, and if we could do without it
forever, I think it would be good.”

The highly valued freedom of this
university as manifested in its non-
affiliation with any particular re-
ligious or social group, is further in
the board’s policy on governmental
financial aid.

 

 

By HOWARD SLATER

The bulletin board outside Payne
Hall is never so carefully reviewed
as when incidents of misconduct and
the consequent punishments have
been announced. The popularity, so
to speak, with which these an-
nouncements are received, attest to
the fact that these are situations
which mean a great deal to most of
the student body.

It is not difficult to understand
why this should be so. The reac-
tions of most students to these no-
tices indicate that they realize that
it might easily have been their fate
to suffer one of the forms of pun-
ishment which have been devised to
keep the course of gentlemanly con-
duct on an even keel. A number of
students, I suspect, must sometimes
start with guilty recognition at the
identification of the incident in
question with some act that they
themselves had done in the past.
Clearly, all of us realize that we are
potentially capable of committing
the very same transgressions which
are being punished.

A Policy of Deterrence

This latent capability for un-
gentlemanly conduct is the basic
reason why these notices are made
public. The reaction—“that could
have been me’’—is precisely the ef-
fect which was intended. It is a
policy of deterrence and, as the
word implies, is based on fear.

How can we then accept such a
policy after it is stated so bluntly
in these terms? How can we then
continue to guide our social behav-
ior in terms of “getting away with
what can be gotten away with?”
This is, after all, the true general
nature of our social relation to the
faculty (although there are un-
doubtedly individual exceptions),
and it is the true nature of our con-
cept of a personal social ideal. The
sudent body-faculty relationship is,
in general, based on fear; and the
student’s personal code of social val-
ues is based on his knowledge of
what he can get away with.

The important influence, however,
is the first—the engendering of fear.
But it is foolish to think that the
faculty really wants to pursue a
policy of deterrence. It is equally as
foolish to believe that a new Dean
of Students relishes his first oppor-
tunity to punish students, in order
to establish fear of his authority as
quickly as possible. These are nega-
tive approaches to a problem, and
negativism can only harvest a bitter
crop.

That is why the newly-formed
Student Control Committee is so
important. It represents a positive
approach to the problem of gentle-
manly conduct. And make no mis-
take about the importance of such an
ideal. It is justifiable to scoff when
conduct means no more than man-
ners, as it does to many. But con-
duct can and should express the
inner man, and what his true social
beliefs are.

The Control Committee

The Control Committee is poten-
tially in a position where it can do
much to really instill such an ideal.
The Dean and the Administrative

 

Committee of the faculty seem gen-

 

uinely concerned with promoting
the Control Committee and _ its
work. And the student body is po-
tentially in a position to profit
thereby.

But the Student Control Commit-
tee, in order to realize this potential
for good, cannot resort to the wrist-
slapping methods which the faculty

Dr. John Gunn tells us that Har-

Orphan Annie” cartoon strip, is a
confirmed socialist. Daddy War-

of entrepreneur while the other
businessmen in the strip are always
portrayed as graft-mongers.

Dr. Gunn’s comment came as a
result of last week’s column by
Steve Henry satirizing the charac-
ters in “Litthe Orphan Annie.”

The Adventures
Of Mildew
On the SCCWS

By STEVE HENRY
Dear Mother and Daddy,

I thought I would write and tell
you about another great honor that
just came my way up here at school.
What it is is this—I got named to
the Student Censorship Committee
for Wayward Students (SCCWS),
and I’m real happy about it because
it shows how much faith some peo-
ple have in my ability to make re-
sponsible decisions.

What we do on the committee is
decide what punishment should be
given to students who don’t con-
duct themselves as gentlemen. You
know how important it is up here
for a person to conduct himself in
a gentlemanly manner, and I hope
you also see how important our
committee is. It’s like one guy on
the committee said, “We sure are
important.”

The faculty used to have a com-
mittee that did the same thing we
do, but they turned all the respon-
sibility over to the students. That’s
one good thing about this school: it
recognized that students are capa-
ble of making decisions that most
colleges leave to adults. Of course,
there was some talk about how we
would probably be too lenient on
our fellow students, and I’ve got to
admit that it looks like we might be
partial toward our friends, but, let
me tell you, that’s not the case. We
are trying our hardest to live up to
the trust that the faculty had in us,
and show everybody that we mean
business when we say we’re going to
maintain this school’s gentlemanly
reputation, which has always been
the very essence (and I hope always
will be) of our school.

Just to give you an example of
how we’re trying on this committee,
I thought I would tell you about a
few of the cases that have already
come up before us, and how we
acted on the cases. I guess the first
important one happened last week
when a member of the student body
belched in a local restaurant. Of
course, there’s nothing more dis-
gusting than that, and certainly
nothing more ungentlemanly, so we
confined him to his room in the
dormitory for the rest of the semes-
ter.

You might think this was too len-
ient a punishment for such a hein-
ous offense, but we had a plan be-
hind it. You see, he hasn’t got any
cuts, and, if he can’t leave his room,
he’ll never to able to go to class,
and naturally will fail out of school.
We just can’t have undesirable peo-
ple around this school. No sir!

Another interesting case happened
when we caught a member of the
student body making out with a girl
in public. They were in the basement
of a fraternity house during a party
week-end, and were actually kissing
right in front of everyone in the
room. Now you know as well as I
do that people just don’t do things
like that. Obviously the boy is ab-
normal, doing that in public with
at least five people in the same
room. We put him on social proba-
tion for the next three years. This
means that he can’t have a date,
can’t go around his fraternity house,
can’t leave campus except on a
school-sponsored trip, and has to
sign out of the dorm at night when
he goes to the library. We’re trying
to get the girl kicked out of her
school, but I’m afraid the authori-
ties there aren’t aware of the grav-
ity of the situation.

And then there was the case of
the boy who went over to a neigh-
boring college, and called up his girl
on the phone. The trouble was that
he called after 10:30 p.m., which is
the latest anyone from our school
can use the phone anywhere. There
was nothing we could do when we
found out about it (one of his
friends turned him in—the honor
system REALLY works, you know)
except recommend to the faculty
that he be kicked out of school. A
gentleman just keeps off the phone
after 10:30. That’s all there is to it.
Like I said earlier, you’ve got to
be tough or people will walk all
over you, and that’s why we're try-
ing to run the SCCWS as tough as
we possibly can.

Let me tell you, it’s a thankless
job. You’d be surprised how many
people are critical of us, just be-
cause we saw our duty and did it
in these cases. I think it’s just an-
other example of how mixed up
morals of students at this school
are,

I really haven’t got much time
before dinner, so I guess I better
end this letter. I just wanted you to
know that I’m doing something
worthwhile up here, and not just
goofing off. Thank you for the val-
entine, and I'll write again soon.

Your loving son,
Mildew

Action in I-M Basketball Playoffs.

 

SAE Moves Toward
I-M Basketball Title

SAE took a giant step toward the intra-mural basketball
championship last night when it handed the Delts a 51-37 de-

feart in Dormus Gymnasium.

Led by Henry Sackett’s game-*
high 24 points, the SAE’s recovered
from an early 13-6 deficit, and came
on to win going away.

The SAE’s, now 2-0 in play-off
competition, moved past the Kappa
Sig’s in the first round, 66-37. Phil
Sharpe contributed 28 points for the
winners; Lance Tarrance got 13 for
the losers.

In other first round action, the
Delts defeated the Sigma Chi’s
55-14.

Chi’s Out

Sigma Chi, which won its league
in a post-season play-off against the
KA’s was eliminated from the
championship Thursday night by the
Kappa Sig’s.

Trailing by three points with less
than a minute to go, the Sig’s turned
a stolen pass into one basket, then
scored the winning point on a short
jump shot by Tarrance with only
seconds left on the clock.

Both the Kappa Sig’s and Delts
are 1-1 in the double-elimination
tournament.

They play Monday night, and the
winner will meet the SAE’s to de-
termine the school champion.

To win, however, the winner of
the Delt-Kappa Sig game, will have
to defeat the SAE’s twice, while one

In 1961, the Beta’s won the bas-

Mountaineer Matmen Here Tonight

A powerful West Virginia wrestling team moves into Dore-
mus Gymnasium tonight for a 7:30 meeting with the Generals,
and coach Dick Miller is hoping for “just a little luck’’ against

the Mounties.

West Virginia has compiled a 5-2-1 record against major
competition this season, including wins over North Carolina,

The Citadel, and VMI, which

Pitt Tonight

By ED NORTON

Washington and Lee’s swimming
team takes on a strong University of
Pittsburgh team tonight in the
Doremus gym pool at 8 p.m. Coach
Norris Eastman says that Pitt has
some top swimmers but W&lL’s
depth should make it a close meet.

The varsity swimmers went down
to their first defeat of the season on
Monday, losing to a powerful Univ-
ersity of Maryland 61-24. Until the
loss at College Park, only a tie with
William and Mary had marred the
team’s record.

Maynard, Relay Team Win

Maryland captured firsts in all but
two of the eleven events. The 400
yard freestyle relay team and cap-
tain Elliott Maynard in the 200 yard
breaststroke were the lone winners
for Washington and Lee. Coach
Norris Eastman singled out Herb
Jahncke, John Wolfe, and Maynard
as the outstanding performers for
the losers.

Washington and Lee returned to
winning track quickly, swamping
Catholic University of Washington,
D.C. 70-25 on Tuesday. The tank-
men took first place in all events
except the 200 yard backstroke and
the 200 yard butterfly. Freshman
John Woolf again broke his school
record in the 440 yard free style
with a time of 5:13.4. Eastman was
particularly encouraged by the out-
standing performance of three other
freshmen. David Geer in the 160
yard individual medly, Skip Chase
in the 50 yard free style, and Rigly
Grant in the 100 yard free style all
won their respective events.

The team’s record now stands at
7-1-1 with one meet remaining after
Pitt.

Next Friday, the tankmen meet
East Carolina, here. Coach Eastman
pointed out that East Carolina de-
feated Norfolk division of William
and Mary by almost exactly the
same score as Washington and Lee.

has one of its best teams in years.
——i

The Generals are 6-2 for the year,
but the West Virginia match is the
toughest in their ten match schedule.

Miller will go with his usual start-
ing line-up, which means Butch
West, Dave Montgomery, Tom
Stover, Pete Winfield, Sandy Mer-
sereau, Dick Albert, Herb Smith,
and either Bob Pagano or Jud Bab-
cock.

In the West Virginia match, Al-
bert, Smith, and Pagano or Babcock
will be facing their toughest match-
es of the year according to Miller.

He called West Virginia “excep-
tionally good” in the top three or
four weight divisions.

Praise

Miller called his 1961-62 squad the
“best balanced and fastest” team in
his ten years of coaching at W&L.

“We're not particularly big in size
this year,’ he said. “But our boys
have kept on the offensive and have
been one step ahead of the oppon-
ent most of the time.”

“We'll have to keep it up against
West Virginia of we're going to win.
A little luck might help out, too,”
he added.

Miller singled out freshman Pete
Winfield and Butch West for indi-
vidual praise.

West, wrestling in the 112-pound
class, has compiled a 6-2 record for
the year.

Winfield, who’s appeared in only
two matches this year, has won both
decisively. Miller said, “Winfield
might make the difference against
West Virginia.”

Individual records for
are as follows:

West, 6-2

Montgomery, 5-2

Stover, 5-1

Winfield, 2-0

Fauber, Thackston Lead |

Generals Past Maroons

By LANCE TARRANCE
Washington and Lee’s basketball Generals jumped into an
early 14-point lead, then held off hot-shooting Roanoke Col-
lege for a 77-75 win here Wednesday.

The W&L victory ended a

three game Maroon winning

streak, and lifted the Generals’ season record to 5-7.

With Bip Fauber, Tom Supak and*
Brett Thackson leading the way, the
Generals surged into a 38-22 lead
after 14 minutes of the first half.

Comeback

Then Roanoke guard Rod Ely led
the Maroons in a comeback that cut
W&L’s lead to seven points, and it
was 40-33 at halftime.

The Generals hit at a 42.5 per cent
clip from the floor during the first
half, with Fauber scoring 15 points,
which included six straight field
goals, five of them coming on long
jumpers from outside the key.

Despite some of the finest outside
shooting displayed in Dormeus Gym
this year, the Maroons never came
closer in the second half than the
final two-point margin.

Ely, leading the Roanoke fast
break, set up forward Morris Creg-
ger for six straight baskets of his
own, all coming on jump shots from
the corner.

Thackston Hot

But Brett Thackston, seeing con-
siderable action for the first time
this year, came up with six straight,
too, and when Thackston couldn’t
get open for a shot, Tom Supak
slipped through for repeated lay-ups
and short jumpers to uphold the
Generals’ lead.

Fauber had 25 for W&L, which
put four men in double figures. Su-

 

 

pak had 18, Thackston 14, and guard
Louie Paterno 12.

Ely, with 24, Cregger, with 18, and
Steve Baker, with 16, led the Ma-
roons.

As usual, Fauber led both teams
in rebounding, picking up 14. Supak
got eight, and Paterno got six.

The Generals were cold from the
free throw line, making only nine of
19 there. Roanoke hit 15 for 24 at the
line.

Hot Shooting

But the Generals made up for it
with a 48 percent overall shooting
average, good enough to win in al-
most any league.

Washington and Lee’s next ac-
tion is against Catholic University
tonight. Saturday, the Generals meet
Washington University.

NSA Debate Postponed

(Continued from page 1)
was stepping into a car for the drive
over. Each time they have pleaded
a lack of cooperation from their na-
tional officers.

Distlehorst, commenting on the
“disorganization in the organization,”
said that the two national vice-
presidents have been ordered to re~-
port for their army physicals, and
that the NSA agent who is a Peace
Corps recruiting officer was some-
how drafted. This may provide an
explanation of the situation.

Distlehorst also suggested the
possibility that the mere scheduling
of a debate against himself and Mc-
Thenia had effected a change of
sides among the NSA adherents, and
that NSA is on the way out of
neighboring schools.

Wrestlers Meet W. Va.

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team traveled to Hampden-Sydney
Wednesday and made the Tigers
wish they hadn’t shown.

The Generals won handily, 33-5,
registering five pins en route to
victory.

Scoring wins on pins were Butch
West in 8:06, Tom Stover in 2:49,
Sandy Mersereau in 4:20, and Herb
Smith in 1:53.

Dick Albert won by forfeit, and
Dave Montgomery, making his first
start since a leg injury during Fancy
Dress, won by a 7-1 decision.

Freshman Garrett Kratzig, who
made his first varsity appearance
against H-S, was pinned in the last
period for the Tigers’ only victory,
but W&L coach Dick Miller said
that Kratzig did “an outstanding
job,” especially since this is his first
year as a wrestler.

The win brought the Generals’
season record to 6-2.
