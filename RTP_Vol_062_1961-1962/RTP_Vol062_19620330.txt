McFall Won’t Run For Minks Presidency

The Friday edition learned today
that Don McFall, SAE rising junior,
who had been mentioned as the
leading University Party candidate
for president of the Mongolian
Minks, will not run in the forth-
coming Mink elections.

McFall, who was far ahead of all
other candidates in a sample poll
conducted by this newspaper, stat-
ed that “the pressures of my other
activities, together with my heavy
academic commitments, will force
me to stay out of the race.”

“T have given a great deal of con-
sideration to the heavy responsibili-
ties of this office,” said McFall, “and
I really feel that I will not be able
to give the Minks the leadership
they deserve. We have had wonder-
ful relations with the faculty and I
do not feel that I will have the time
to keep up our relationship with
them.”

would not preclude his serving the
student body in other posts. He stat-
ed: “While I realize that the Mon-
golian Mink president is the most
responsible of all campus officers, I
feel that I may perhaps serve the
student body better in some other
capacities. I may run for the posi-
tion of chaplain of my fraternity, or
perhaps for secretary of Phi Beta
Kappa.”

“I will not, however, be a candi-
date for Dean of Students. I feel
that the Dean of Students should be
either a senior or a law student.
Maybe next year. I might mention,
though, that I am polishing up my
handball game.”

McFall’s announcement has
thrown the campus political situa-
tion into a state of chaotic uncer-
tainty.

University Party chairman Gran-
tham Couch said that “this may well

party. We are trying to persuade
him to run. I personally hope that
he changes his mind for the good
of the University and the good of
the party.”

Other campus political leaders ex-
pressed varying opinions.

Tom Rains, president of the KA
house, said “this comes as a terrible
shock to me. We had expected that
McFall would lead a University
Party sweep of campus elections.
After all, it’s an old saying that as
the Minks go, so goes the Univer-
sity.”

Tony Council, SAE house presi-
dent, told a Friday reporter that
“McFall is the best candidate to
come out of our house in years. We
still can’t believe that he won’t run.
We had been pushing him for ma-
jor offices all along, and now we fin-
ally get him set for the big one, he
dumps on us.”

 

 

chairman, was jubilant. “This is our
chance to get back into power on
campus. If we can persuade Chris-
tian to run for Minks president, we’ll
be golden. I am sure that the Uni-
versity Party’s chances have been
dealt a grave blow by McFall’s de-
cision.”

Bill Lowry, well-known NFU, said
“this merely bears out what we have
been saying in Protest all year. This
campus is deep in the direst depths
of apathy when a man of McFall’s
qualifications will not run for presi-
dent of the Minks. If we ever need
a constitutional convention and a
Ban-on-the-bomb, we need it now.”
Ben Brown, another Protest spokes-
man voiced a like opinion.

Steve Rutledge, assimilation com-
mittee chairman, said: “I am afraid
this will hurt seriously our cam-
paign to make the campus better-
dressed. Both Don Huffman and I

did example for the rest of the
school in matters of fashion.”

Ed Side, Lexington impressario,
stated that McFall’s decision would
hurt the local theatres in their
comeback attempt. Side said that
McFall is the type of man who will
lead the students back into the mov-
ies. “He has greatly helped my busi-
ness this year, and I am sure he
would help it more from such an in-
fluential position.”

An authoritative source at Hollins
said that McFall’s election to the
Mink presidency would help rela-
tions between her school and Wash-
ington and Lee. She said, however,
that she was not surprised that Mc-
Fall was too busy to seek election,
“He’s down here all the time any-
way. We wanted to run him for
president of the Cotollion Club.”

Thorns Craven is president of the
Minks currently.

IFC Petitions Faculty
For Academic Change

Interfraternity Council President Bob Doenges delivered a
student petition to the regular faculty meeting yesterday after-
noon which requests that the faculty make a thorough study
of the possibility of doing away with 8:25 and 12:05 classes,
eliminating all afternoon labs and giving freshmen unlimited

cuts.

Doenges said that a number of
fraternity men had become con-
vinced that freshmen were subject-
ed to too many academic pressures
when they first entered the Univer-
sity and they felt that the fraterni-
ties should “get first crack at the
boys” before they become too in-
volved with their studies.

Doenges said that the fraternity
men behind the petition, who have
asked to remain anonymous, had
asked him to present it to the fac-
ulty. He pointed out that his pre-
sentation of the petition was solely
as IFC president and did not im-
ply that he supported it.

Expects More Signers

The petition bears the signatures
of about 25 per cent of the student
body but Doenges said he expected
nearly all the students to sign it by
the end of Spring vacation.

In other business, the faculty, act-
ing on complaints from townspeople
that students were staying up too
late, decided to do away with final
exams and limit hour quizzes in
each course to one per semester.

Also, the new Faculty Control
Committee, suspended one professor
for giving pop quizzes and campused
three others for “conduct which
aroused the concern of authorities
at the Travellers’ Club.”

Five professors have lost their
Glenn Grants for failing to give a
2.00 overall average in the courses
they teach.

University President Fred C. Cole
said that the moves were taken on
the faculty’s own initiative, and not
because of pressure from the stu-
dents.

SCC Knocks Dancing In Public

The Student Control Committee in a recent policy meeting voiced its
disapproval at the growing number of reported incidents of public dancing
on the part of Washington and Lee students.

It is felt by the committee that such action not only places a student
in a position of possible involvement with The Saturday Review of Litera-
ture, but that it also leaves a poor impression with the members of the
community and with visiting high school tours.

In the future, students engaged in public dancing will be campused.

In reaching the decision to halt such conduct on the part of students,
the Committee expressed its hope that fraternities will replace combo
parties with mock Cold Check Committee meetings, thereby combatting

“We had originally tried to get
Louis Armstrong for this dance,”
said Galef, “But he was unable to

could get Valentine. His agent tells
us that his band has been a tre-
mendous success, and is one of the
fastest rising groups in America.”

Valentine’s band includes piano
player Hank Holman, bassist Pep
Wilson, and drummer Jim Frog.

When Valentine formed his group
he picked up Holman from the Par-
ry McClure marching band, and
Wilson from the VMI Commanders
Frog had never played drums until
a month ago but so impressed an
audience at the SPE fraternity house
during a recent combo party with
his performance at intermission that
Valentine, always on the look for
new talent, signed him up immedi-
atly.

Random Notes On PE:
Muscular Christianity?

By TRACY HARRINGTON

To the incoming freshman, Wash-
ington and Lee promises a myriad
of wonderful things. Chiefly, though,
it proports to produce gentlemen—
and that, after all, is what the world
really needs to solve its problems.

Three areas of endeavor are in-
volved in the metamorphosis of the
awkward, unkempt freshmen into
the suave, studly Washington and
Lee man. Two of these are the train-
ing of the young minds in matters
intellectual (the University courses)
and matters social (the Greek letter
fraternities). The third realm in the
education of a gentleman is the one
which I shall pursue today—the de-
velopment of the body, accomplished
by the two year course in physical
education.

After the initial introduction to
campus life via freshman camp and
and Rush Week, followed by the
awesome attendance for the first
time at real college lectures, the
novice student discovers, to his
horrible dismay, Doremus Gym-
nasium; he will come to associate
it with smelly people, screaming
sadists, and sick feelings in the pit of
his stomach.

Terrorizing Tests

The gym curriculum calls first for
a series of tests to discover just how
miserably weak are America’s gen-
eration of weaklings. These “tests”
are enough to terrorize the most
biceped beast of them all.

Initially, the freshman must pass
the swimming test. That in itself is
bad enough—even though everyone
knows that a gentleman must be
able to swim 16 laps of a standard-
ized pool. The really frightening
thing is the manner in which the
pool is entered. The nude, shiver-
ing bodies of thirty-odd freshmen
are herded up to the second story
of the gymnasium. A few gasps are
heard, and a few shieks of terror
echo over the balcony and down—
impossibly down—to the swimming
pool. The realization comes that
they actually intend for you to jump
off into what looks like a rectangu-
lar postage stamp. But like true gen-
tlemen all, the freshmen close their
eyes, protect themselves as best they
can, and jump.

Muscular Christianity

The remainder of the tests in-
volve balancing on your head, sit-
ups, push-ups, duck walks, and THE
MILE. Except for the few fleet-
footeds (whom, by the way, every-
body else hates), the freshmen crawl
from the gym heaving, moaning,
and cursing the originators of Mus-
cular Christianity.

Eventually the testing is over, and
the real fun begins. (Some unfortu-
nates never quite make the mile or
the swimming test, however. Rumor
has it that there are seniors who
have unsuccessfully run and swum
their way tortuously through four
years in an attempt to pass their
gym requirement.)

For the first semester, freshmen
hit golf balls, turn cartwheels,
climb ropes, wrestle, and play soc-
cer. Many sports taught at Wash-
ington and Lee seem to have sev-
eral unique features: All of them
can be played when you're 90, all
of them tend to emphasize how un-

coordinated you are, and most of
them require outside participation
(sort of like parallel reading in
P.E.) at one or another of Lexing-
ton’s athletic establishments.

The most memorable activity in
the first semester is what is inno-
cently referred to as “tumbling.”
The cartwheels, standing on the
head, and turning somersaults
aren’t so bad. It’s the rope climb
that really gets you. About half way
up the thing, your arms give out.
You look down, and far below, you
see the hard, hard floor and the
smiling face of the gym teacher.
Then to scream, slide down the
rope, burn your hands, and get a D
for effort.

The second half of the year begins
while freshmen are engaged in ac-
tivities of another realm of their
gentlemanly training. This is the
culmination of the fraternity pledge
program, politely and farcically re-
ferred to as Help Week. Gym in-
structors seem to choose this par-
ticular week to emphasize calis-
thenics.

As far as formal sports are con-
cerned, the agenda calls for hand-
ball, bowling, volleyball, table ten-
nis, and tennis during the spring
semester. Handball and bowling are
tolerable—of course, the majority
of the freshmen aren’t quite sure
what they are doing, but since this
is not a new experience, they aren’t
upset by their ignorance and manage
to avoid killing each other with
handballs or bowling balls.

The Gym, Chamber of Horrors

The greatest game is volleyball.
Before freshmen are allowed to
participate in the intricacies of the
game, they gather in circles of seven
or eight people and throw the volley
ball back and forth. Some particu-
larly agile fellows do pretty well at
this—others stand frozen with em-
barrassment and let the ball bounce
off their heads rather than maket
even bigger fools of themselves. A
chance visitor to Doremus Gymnas-
ium (although why anybody would
by chance or otherwise enter its
chamber of horrors is beyond me),
would probably think he had hap-
pened into a rehabilitation center for
the physically afflicted.

The period of instruction is fol-
lowed by a few futile weeks of play-
ing volleyball itself. Occasionally,
someone forgets where he is, catches
himself having a good time, and then
blushes for fear someone else might
notice.

And so goes the physical train-
ing of the young gentleman....
Each of those who have gone
through it will forever have a spe-
cial feeling for such phrases as
“line up for cal,” “take five laps,”
and “dress out.” It’s just another
part—a dear and meaningful one—
of our education, and let us all cher-
ish with our sheepskins those vital
little straps of elasticity which sym-
bolize the precious hours spent in
Doremus Gymnasium pursuing gen-
tlemanliness.

By BILL ATWELL

Associate Professor of Fine Arts
and Director of Music at Washing-
ton and Lee Robert Stewart will
have three compositions played at
the Roanoke Fine Arts Festival
May 2. This festival, the only one of
its kind in the state, is unique in
that it is devoted entirely to “new
music.” It is sponsored by the Roan-
oke Fine Arts Center and this year
is under the direction of W&L al-
umnus Benno Foreman. Aside from
Mr. Stewart’s pieces, the compo-
sitions of David Davis, Sydney Hod-
kinson, and John Diercks will be
featured.

Stewart’s New York Performance

Stewart has had a busy year al-
ready. In mid-March he had a New
York performance of his Three
Pieces for Woodwind Quintet. Earl-
ier in the year he had works played
at the Birmingham Arts Festival
and the Roanoke Symphony played
his Prelude for Strings. Recently he
has had two more honors bestowed
upon him. The Conservatory of

 

Puerto Rico has asked permission to
include two of his pieces for wood-
winds in its library. They will be
played sometime next year. In ad-
dition, he has been selected by the
Southeastern Composers’ League to
have compositions played at the
University of Alabama Symposium
of Contemporary Music.

Stewart’s pieces to be played at
the Roanoke Festival include Trio
No. 2 for Violin, Cello, and Piano,
Canzona, and Divertissement. The
Canzona and Divertissement were
written especially for the John
A. Graham Brass Choir and will be
performed by it. Of special interest
in the Divertissement is the use of
improvisitory dialogues between the
two trumpets. Stewart said, “This
is an attempt to put some of the
musical creativity and interpreta-
tion back in the hands of the per-
formers.” The piece was first per-
formed in March on WDBJ-TV in
Roanoke.

The other three composers are, as
Mr. Stewart, members of the South-
eastern Composers’ League and mu-

sic instructors at Virginia colleges.
Mr. Davis is at present Director
of the Glee Club at the University
of Virginia. He had a New York
performance of his Changes and Cy-
cles in February of this year as part
of the Music of Our Time series.

His Pieces to be played in Roan-
oke are Seven Poems of Basho, a
vocal solo for soprano which will
be performed by his wife, and a
Conversation Piece. The latter will
be out of a jazz idiom complete with
improvisation developed from a
small group including keyboard,
percussion, and flugelhorn.

U. Va. Band Director

Hodkinson is also from the Uni-
versity of Virginia. He is a profes-
sor of music and director of the
U.Va. band. He recently had a per-
formance of his compositions by
the New York Percussion Group.
He, too, has been selected by the
Southeastern Composers’ League for
a performance at the University of
Alabama Symposium of Contempo-
rary Music.

 

Stewart’s Compositions Will Be Presented
This Spring In Roanoke Fine Arts Festival

In Roanoke his Drawings, Set No.
3 for Clarinet and Percussion will
be played along with Study for
Magnetic Tape. The latter is an ex-
cursion into the field of electronic
music. It will be the first time a
performance of this type has been
given in Virginia.

The final composer on the program
will be John Diercks, director of
music at Hollins College. In the past
year he has had a performance at
the Birmingham Festival and at the
University of Mississippi.

Dierck’s Suite for Flute and Pi-
ano and Mirror of Brass will be per-
formed in Roanoke. The Washington
and Lee Brass Choir will be on hand
to play the latter.

The Festival itself is an attempt,
according to Stewart, to stimulate
interest in contemporary music here
in Virginia. It is hoped that anyone
interested will attend the show,
scheduled for May 2nd. We are in-
deed fortunate to have such gifted
composers in the area and it would
be well worth anyone’s while to
listen to what they have to offer.

Fraternities Overshadow
Individuals In Politics

By HOWARD SLATER

As was somewhat reluctantly but
necessarilly pointed out last week,
my editor and I sometimes do not
agree. To be more precise, we al-
most invariably disagree; and it is
certainly potent proof of his dedica-
tion to open-mindedness, as well as
more personal values, such as re-
straint, perserverance, and stamina,
that he continues to print this col-
ucn,

Several weeks ago, he man-
aged to extract some gentle revenge
from my natural tendency to get
my feet caught up in my mouth, by
quoting me, supposedly excathedra,
as chairman of one of the less than
distinguished political parties which
plague the student body. My state-
ment at that time was: “I may be re-
membered as the most idealistic,
naive, and unsuccessful party chair-
man in years.” This came in answer
to my beloved editor’s question
about some specifics of our political
situation.

The interesting thing is that the
word “unsuccessful” somehow didn’t
get printed with the rest of the
quote. Looking back, it seems as if
that was a significant mistake, be-
cause idealism, naivete, and lack of
success go hand in hand, at least
insofar as they apply on our cam-
pus-cosmos. What I am. saying,
therefore, is not that I may be an
unsuccessful party chairman be-
cause the opposition part may (and
probably will) sweep the coming
elections. I will be unsuccessful in
politics as a member of the student

_| body. We are all in this together.

And the pot we’re in needs a good
cleaning!
The Fraternities

The basis of our political system
is the fraternity, and not the in-
dividual candidate. Candidates are
chosen—at least in part, and or-
dinarily—as representatives of their

 

houses. The same principle applies
in other extra-curricular affairs,
whether some foolish people are
willing to admit it or not. The only
point to be debated, apparently, is
whether it is socially good form to
say so publicly. The principle that
houses stand or fall on the for-
tunes of politics also may be de-
bated. I do not think that this is so.

Nevertheless, this is the common
belief, which gives rise to the com-
munity approach to politics here;
and this gives rise to a situation in
which we all are destined to fail.
For where is ability, where is re-
sponsibility, and where is concern
for the represented, in this scheme
of things? Obviously, nowhere—nor
do they deserve to be, because if
student officials are not able, if they
are not responsible, and if they do
not care to know what the elec-
torate thinks and wants (and this

Phi Psi’s Defeat Delts
To Become Mat Champs

Phi Kappa Psi captured the 1962
Intra-mural wrestling champion-
ship this week by defeating Delta
Tau Delta 19-11.

Phi Psi moved into an early lead
when Peter Alford, wrestling in the
123-pound slot, outpointed the
Delts’ Gordon Gay.

The winners were forced to for-
feit in the 130-pound class. Then
Tom Andrews came up with a 9-7
win over Rick Erickson to move
the Delts into the lead.

Brack Dew scored the Delts last
points by taking down Spence Stou-
fer.

The Phi Psi’s got strong perform-
ance in all the heavy weight clas-
ses to win.

Jim Wearn and Tom Clements
both won, and Mike Harris pinned
Dud Warwick in one of the best
I-M matches of the year.

Wayne Bradshaw, undefeated for
four years in I-M wrestling, pinned
Wig Wiggins in the unlimited divis-
ion to put away the win for the Phi
Psi’s.

high hurdles.

Hickey

Also outstanding for W&L was
senior Jim Hickey, who won both
the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes.

Hickey ran a 10.5 hundred into a
strong wind, and posted a good 22.9
mark in the 220.

sky, Tom Edwards, Chip Day, Mike
Shank, Skip Essex, and John Pear-

with Glenn Thacker, but the best
ball also lost a heartbreaker, 8-7.

At this point, MIT led 314-214,

Both Paul McBride, playing in his

Slater Says That Majority of Students Don’t Care

(Continued from page 2)

is too often the case) then this is
so because the electorate itself does
not care!

Who Cares?

Can anyone claim that the ma-
jority of students do care—when
they insist on revering some
sacrosanct list of a candidate’s ac-
tivities, commonly called his “qual-
ifications,” but which usually have
no bearing on him or the elected
office he is to fill? when they insist
on neglecting almost entirely what a
man ‘stands for’ or how he intends
to approach basic issues? and when
they insist rigidly on adhering to
very real, almost tangible, party
lines, except in special instances
when they’ll switch for the sake of
a man with personality, revealing
that it really is coolness and not
thoughtfulness which is valued in a
student leader?

For these reasons we are destined

to be failures once again in the
petty game of politics. What hap-
pened last year was quite literal-
ly a good thing, because the stu-
dent body didn’t accept complacent-
ly whatever the two political part-
ies decreed for it. If it were to do so
again, or if the parties were to rise
above their selfishness and mediocre
practices, we might have cause for
hope. But even I am not so idealis-
tic and naive as to put much faith
in that cheerful possibility.

 

O’Day Funeral Tomorrow

A funeral service for Michael Wil-
liam O’Day, 26, a first year law stu-
dent at Washington and Lee who
died yesterday of an apparently self-
inflicted gunshot wound, will be
held tomorrow in St. Patrick’s Ro-
man Catholic Church here.

The 10 a.m. mass will be said by
Father Francis McCarthy, pastor of
the church.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

Seven years now I have been writing this column for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and each year when I come to
the last column of the year, my heart is gripped by the same
bittersweet feeling. I shall miss you sorely, dear readers, in the
long summer days ahead. I shall miss all you freckle-faced
boys with frogs in your pockets. I shall miss all you pig-tailed
girls with your gap-toothed giggles. I shall miss you one and
all—your shining morning faces, your apples, your marbles,
your jacks, your little oilcloth satchels.

But I shall not be entirely sad, for you have given me many
a happy memory to sustain me. It has been a rare pleasure
writing this column for you all year, and I would ask every
one of you to come visit me during the summer except there is
no access to my room. The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
after I missed several deadlines, walled me in. All I have is
a mail slot into which I drop my columns and through which
they supply me with Marlboro Cigarettes and such food as
will slip through a mail slot. (For six months now I have been
living on after-dinner mints.)

 

Grits Tine he ts Ha deel 5

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such a cruel thing.
Manly and muscular they may be, and gruff and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com-
passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.

I am only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers
of Marlboros for back wages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cash, but they have given me something far more
precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as I.

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not covered me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved
no commercial advertising whatsoever on my person. My suit,
of course, is another matter, but even here they have exercised
taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, they have put this fetching little jingle:

Are your taste buds out of kilter?

Are you bored with smoking, neighbor?
Then try that splendid Marlboro filter,
Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor!

On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the members of the Marlboro board and their families. On my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, ““Who’ll buy my Marlboros?”

I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.

Have a good summer. Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

© 1961 Max Shulman

The makers of Marlboros and the new unfiltered king-size
Philip Morris Commander have been happy to bring you
this uncensored, free-wheeling column all year long. Now, if
we may echo old Max: Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.
