Troubs Begin
‘Othello’ Show
On Wednesday

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Associate Editor

Several months of diverse,
but concentrated effort will
culminate tomorrow _ night
when the curtain rises on the
Troubadour Theatre produc-
tion of Othello.

Actors have been memorizing
lines and going through their paces;
stagehands have been building,
painting and cleaning. Not the
easiest job to be done was the ar-
ranging of the play for a modern
audience.

Had To Reduce Length
This job fell to Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of the Troubadours. His
major problem was to reduce the
length of the play. Uncut the play
would run about 3 hours 12 minutes.
“This I felt was simply too long

for most modern audiences,” Dr.
Jones said.
“American actors, especially

amateur groups, speak verse much
slower than do the English, there-
fore we had to cut it a bit more
than English productions usually
do. The overall effect of this cut-
ting has been to bring the pro-
duction time closer to Shake-
speare’s ‘two hours traffic upon
the stage’,” he said.

Total playing time is now about
2 hours 15 minutes.

To reduce the time by this much
required the elimination of about
700 lines out of a total of 3200 in
the play. “I felt it possible to do
this without hurting the play as
far as plot, theme or character de-
velopment was concerned,” Dr.
Jonues said.

Cutting Done in Steps

Careful cutting was done in a
number of steps long before the
play went into rehearsal. Dr. Jones
first went through the play to note
where repetitive passages could be
deleted. Much repetition required
for emphasis was left in. ,

“I also tried to keep the scene
sequence intact,” he said. Only two
very short scenes were taken out.
These show simply a time lapse and
are not vital to the plot.”

The next step was to cut pas-
sages which because of diction or
vocabulary would no longer be
understood. Most significant here
was the complete elimination of
the clown. “The things he said
simply wouldn’t be funny to a
modern audience,” Dr. Jones said.

Final cutting was merely a matter
of deciding relative importance. “I
then re-read the play to see if it
still made sense and that nothing
vital was missing. As we _ went
through rehearsals certain adjust-
ments and reinsertions have been
made,” he said.

Two Parts

In its final form the play will
be given in two parts. (“Most of
Shakespeare’s tragedies break very

Bond Johnson Awarded Grant

By Woodrow Wilson Group

A Washington and Lee Univer-
sity senior has been awarded a
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow-
ship aimed at encouraging the pur-
suit of a college teaching career,
Dean of the College William W.
Pusey II announced today.

E. Bond Johnson III of Birming-
ham, Ala., has received the coveted
highly-competitive award for 1962-
63. He plans graduate work in com-
parative literature.

Johnson is the 18th Washington
and Lee student to receive a Wood-
row Wilson Fellowship since the
university began submitting candi-
dates in 1953.

5 Seniors

Five other Washington and Lee
seniors were accorded “honorable
mention” by the foundation. The
foundation plans to provide all grad-
uate schools with lists of its “hon-
orable mention” students with the
expectation that they will qualify

A Woodrow Wilson Fellowship
covers the costs of a recipient’s first
year in the graduate school of his
choice. The national program, ad-
ministered from Princeton, N. J.,
seeks to direct highly qualified and
highly motivated young people into
the college teaching field.

Johnson was one of 1,058 Wood-
row Wilson Fellows selected from
a field of 9,975 candidates repre-
senting 965 colleges in the United
States and Canada.

The 1962-63 awards represent
the culmination of the first five-
year program of the Woodrow
Wilson Foundation made possible
by a Ford Foundation grant of
$24,500,000 in 1957. Some 5,000 col-
lege graduates have received fel-
lowships in this five-year-period.

The Woodrow Wilson Foundation
was established in 1946. It is under
the presidency of Sir Hugh Taylor,
dean emeritus of Princeton Uni-
versity’s graduate school.

twenty students.

However, the students were overwhelmingly in favor of
opening the Executive Committee legislative meetings to the

public and the press.

The students expressed their de-*

sire to retain in the constitution the
“permanent dismissal” clause as the
sole punishment for an Honor vio-
lation.

The proposed Senate is included in
a revised constitution submitted to
the Executive Committee by Bill
Lowry and Ben Brown, editors of
Protest.

The students were asked a series
of questions pertaining to current
and projected issues on the campus.
The students were picked at random
at locations on and off the campus
and were asked the following ques-
tions:

(1) Are you familiar with the pro-
posed Student Senate? If the an-
swer was no, then the following por-
tion of the proposed constitution was
read to the interviewee:

Article 1, Section 1: All legis-
lative powers herein granted shall
be vested in a Student Senate. The
Student Senate shall be compos-
ed of thirty elected Representa-
tives, six each to be elected from
the Freshman, Sophomore, Junior,
and Senior Classes; and six to be
elected from the Law School. At
least one student from each of the
above enumerated groups shall be
elected from the Independent Stu-
dents.

(2) Are you in favor of the pro-
posed Student Senate?

(3) Do you think Executive
Committee meetings should be
open to the public and press?

(4) What issues do you think
will be prominent in the spring
elections?

 

 

Among the valedictorian’s honors
| on the Washington and Lee campus
is the editorship of the 1962 edition
of the student yearbook. He also has
served as secretary of the student
publications beard and Zeta Beta|
Tau social fraternity. Last year, he |
was president of Phi Eta Sigma, a|
national honorary scholastic frater-
nity for freshmen. He has held de-|

partmental scholarships in physics

 

Are you familiar with the senate?
Yes—10
No—12
No opinion—0
Are you in favor of the senate?
Yes—l1
No—10
No opinion—1
Should EC meetings be open?
Yes—19
No—2
No opinion—1
Are you in favor of “expulsion
for a year” clause?
Yes—1
No—20
No opinion—1

 

Then, this section from the pro-
posed constitution was read to the
interviewee:

Article 3, Section 3, Part A: Up-
on receipt of a Charge of Honor
Violation the Executive Committee
shall meet in executive session to
determine whether or not the
charge as it stands constitutes a
clear violation of the Honor Code.
It shall determine at that time
whether the case, if valid, war-
rants expulsion for a year or per-
manent dismissal.

(5) Are you in favor of the “ex-
pulsion for a year” clause?

The replies to these questions
were recorded with the opinions
rendered with the answers.

The majority of the students asked
about opening the Executive Com-
mittee meetings answered in the af-
firmative saying they couldn’t see
why not; but specified that the Ex-
ecutive Committee should have the
right to call a closed session at its
discretion. This is understood in the
idea for the open meetings.

Opinion was also in the majority
concerning the “expulsion for a
year” clause. In general, all those
answering in the negative offered
the opinion that there are no degrees
of honor and that for the system to
work there must be just one penal-
ty.

When asked as to what issues
would be prominent in the spring
election, most could not think of
any particular ones and felt there
would be a rehash of old ones.

However, these issues were cited
as most likely to be dealt with in
the coming election: the Student
Senate, University dance weekends,
combo hours, rush week proposals,
the power of the faculty over the
student body, open Executive Com-
mittee meetings, conventional dress,
and the revision of the constitution.
Most frequently cited were the Stu-
dent Senate, open EC meetings and
University dance weekends.

Opinions favoring the Student
Senate proposals ranged from “more
representatives” to “will give the
students a greater opportunity to
work in student government.” John
Mills, Independent junior, thought
“the students on the Senate would
be just as qualified as the Execu-

Issues For Coming Campaign:

Reforms In Dance Sets, IFC

With the campus elections coming up in the near future,
there are several issues that might be included in the campaigns.
We hope that the ideas expressed here will be discussed for
their respective merit by the parties and perhaps that they will
be made issues in the coming contests.

1) The Executive Committee should open its legislative
sessions to the public. This would be in keeping with the basic
idea of freedom of speech. Since the Executive Committee is
elected by the Student Body and serves as their representatives,
the Student Body has a right to attend its sessions.

This would not include honor trials and the Executive
Committee could go into executive session any time that it
deemed necessary. As of now, all Executive Committee sessions
are closed both to the public and to the press. There is a
definite need for closer contact between the Executive Commit-
tee and the Student Body. We feel that the opening of their
sessions to the public would help to fulfill this need.

2) The Student Senate, as proposed would be a useless and
cumbersome body. As outlined in a proposed constitutional
draft, the senate would be made up of 30 elected representa-
tives from the Student Body. This group would be entirely too
large and we seriously question the wisdom of such a proposal.
Such a large body would be awkward and would tend to slow
the passage of needed legislation.

In addition, we ask whether there are enough interested and
qualified students to serve in such a capacity. Also, the possi-
bility exists that such a body could become shackled by its own
weight and would come to resemble our present IFC.

It has been further proposed that the non-fraternity men
be assured at least five representatives in that body. This is ab-
surd. Why should one group receive special attention and rep-
resentation? The non-fraternity vote is both active and strong
as the past campus elections will bear out. There is no need to
make a special case out of any one group.

3) With the rising costs of fraternities, the idea that the
class presidents head the four dance sets has definite merit. The
traditional cocktail party could be eliminated and would thus
save the fraternities a great deal of expense. We do not wish to
see the traditional cocktail party, or any party, abolished. How-
ever, financial considerations tend to make such a change both
practical and advisable. In addition, a greater degree of co-
ordination might be obtained by having each of the four aca-
demic classes sponsor the dance sets. This could build greater
Student Body interest in the dance sets and make them more
successful.

4) There has been set forth the idea that the President
of the IFC should be elected by the Student Body. This would
be a wise move. By placing the office of president of the IFC
up to campus election, greater interest and more qualified men
could be found. Furthermore, many of the issues that face the
IFC could be discussed in greater detail before the Student
Body as a whole. This might be a possible solution to some of
the present problems that face the IFC.

These ideas are presented for their face value. We hope
that they will create a basis for discussion in the coming elec-
tions. By taking an active point of view, greater interest will be
created and better candidates and government can result.

John Louis Zimmerman
The death of John Louis Zimmerman, a Beta Theta Pi

senior, comes as a tragic blow to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

Those students who were fortunate enough to have known
him will surely feel the sorrow caused by his death. The Stu-
dent Body has suffered a sincere loss as the result of the death
of one of its finest members.

 

 
   

Wal Geaduate Hopes
Race Trouble Will End

To the Editor:

In Seattle, Washington, any issue
involving racial trouble in the South
is sure to get nearly as much at-
tention in the newspapers as an or-
bital flight. Towards the question
of segregation there is an attitude
of disbelief and indignance that
such a social institution could still
exist in America.

To the credit of most of the people
I have met in this city and at the
University of Washington, they have
shown intelligence and sympathetic
respect in asking about the problems
of the South and the Southern view
of segregation. There are others,
however, and I met several at a
“freedom rider” rally today, who are
convinced that the South is so back-
ward and its intellectuals so passive
that they themselves must take the
initiative in exposing the evils of

segregation and in showing South-
erners the errors of their ways.

That the racial issue is hurting
the South and the country as a
whole is undeniable. One of my
graduate school friends who is a na-
tive of Nigeria has told me that by
far the most powerful propaganda
weapon of the Soviet Union and
communism in Africa is the exist-
ence of racial discrimination and in-
stances of racial violence in the
South.

It seems that this should be an
issue of great concern in the best
and most influential Southern uni-
versities. How much better would it
be for the South and the United
States for educated Southerners to
actively face the problem with a de-
termination to do something about it
rather than leave it to lean and be-

It Might, If West Helps

 

Can Greedy Red Bear Eat Too Much?

By DR. MILTON COLVIN

Associate Professor of
Political Science
“The mistake of all those who
organize armies or set political
policies is to mistake the momen-
tary for the permanent State.”
Hans von Seeckt

Anyone who makes the habit
of reading the Daily Report of the
Foreign Broadcast Information
Service or the State Department
Intelligence Bulletins or, for that
matter, Little Orphan Annie, real-
izes that the world is a slippery
and shifty thing and surprises do
happen.

What is posted as true today
maybe untrue tomorrow and may-
be was false from the very be-
ginning. Information gallops and
we, the citizens walk. Still, some
guesses should be made.

The Soviet Union is not entirely
able to limit its struggle to its op-
en political enemies. It has troub-
le with its “friends” and neigh-
bors in Eastern Europe and well
it should.

Mr. Churchill has pointed out
that those restive groups, The
Czechs, The Poles, The Hungari-
ans, The Slovaks, and The Croats,
once so eager to leave the Haps-
burg Empire and be on their own
have in recent years “suffered
the tortures which mediaevel
theologians usually reserved for
the damned.” This is another way
of saying that they have been
swallowed up by Communism.

Is there any chance that the
Russian Bear will choke on this
meal? Well, perhaps. If we in the
West keep our head and some
modesty as to just how big and
tough we are, we may even help
these unfortunate Eastern and
Central Europeans to make life
more troublesome for Khrushchev
& Co.

Let us tally some facts: Poland
has 28 million people, Czechoslo-
vakia has 14 million, Hungary has
10 million Rumania has 18 million
and Bulgaria 8 million. Add to this
the 18 million of Yugoslavia and
an equal number now walled in
in East Germany and the total
comes out to about 115 million
persons for the Soviets to sit on,
and it is still true that you can
do almost anything with a bay-
onet but sit on it. These 115 mil-
lion persons are the natural al-
lies of the West, geography to the
contrary. All have known a stand-
ard of living higher than the Rus-
sians and all have known more
freedom than what they know
now. The future for them, there-
fore, is a continuing loss. And
they know it.

It can be argued, of course, that
while the old generation of East-
ern Europe remembers “better
days,” the young’ generation
knows only what it is told and it
is told just exactly when the Com-
munist press cares to present.
Such argument overlooks the fact
that the revolt in East Germany
in 1953, the revolt (or near re-
volt) in Poland in 1955, and the
exploding fire of Budapest in the
Fall of 1956, were all basically the
work of young men, those who ac-
cording to Communist doctrine
“should have known better.”

More than one half of the last
arrivals out of East Germany
prior to August 13th when the
Berlin wall went up were under
21 years of age. The belief of the
“captured youth” has been pret-
ty thoroughly demolished. This
is not to say that given enough
time the Communists will not win
over the young, but at the mo-
ment, at least, the game is going
the other way.

It is not, however, the point of
this short piece that Eastern and
Central Europe are pro-West be-
cause they have tough economic

     
   
 
  
       
   
   
   
        
   

going or because they resent
muzzled presses and controlled
thinking. Some of this was not en-
tirely new to them before the
coming to power. Rather, I wish
to make the point that these “cap-
tive nations” are pro-West for the
simple and basic reason that they
are part of the West. Culturally
they belong. And have for a
thousand years. With the excep-
tion of the Serbs and the Bulgars
who have historically, but not re-
cently, regarded the Russians as
friends, all the others have a long
tradition of not getting along with
their big neighbor to the East. The
Poles, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the
Hungarians and the Coats are Ro-
man Catholics and since the great
schism of 1055 have regarded
themselves as defenders of West-
ern Culture against both Mongols
and the Orthodox Church of Rus-
sia. By faith they are oriented to-
ward Rome, not Moscow. We in
the West will be well cautioned to
treat these Central European Na-
tions as part of our own heritage.
It would be a calamity to regard

rope.

them as “distant people about
whom we know but little’—to
quote an unfortunate remark of
the late Prime Minister Chamber-
lain at the time of the Munich
Crisis. It is to keep this trust alive,
rather than to bluster with slo-
gans such as “Liberation” and
“rollback” which we have clearly
demonstrated we are not pre-
pared to back up, that should be
the paramount task of Western
Foreigy Policy. (It is worth not-
ing that if the United States did
intervene in the satellites of Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe either
through large scale delivery of
arms to patriot groups or direct
military intervention in their sup-
port, a general nuclear war would
most certainly result!).

Granted that no Russian Gov-
ernment given the pathological
fear of the Russian people about
invasion from the West, can we
allow the satellites to fall into un-
friendly or even neutral hands?
How can this be done if military
action is ruled out? In part it can
be accomplished by letting the

  

Communists hang themselves on
a rope of their own making. So-
viet agriculture policy wherever
applied, is an unbroken series of
disasters. The satellites are bas-
ically agrarian nations. Ideologi-
cal unity and party dogma are
poor substitutes for commonsense
down on the farm. It seems a fair
guess that “strict application of
communist principles of land re-
form” or even the flexible brand
of Khrushchev & Co. will only
increase the harvest of hatred and
doubt that the Eastern Europeans
already have. There is little evi-
dence to show that the Soviets
are winning friends at the mo-
ment.

All of this is, of course, a vic-
tory won at the expense of our
supporters. Obviously there is a
point of diminishing return on
this. Something POSITIVE has to
be done and from our side. And it
is here that we can take the of-
fensive by intelligent use of mass
media of communication. Radio
Free Europe at its best (it was
at its worst in 1956) is a powerful
and effective weapon against
Communism. Other ways of
the Iron Curtain have been pre-
sented in an aide-memoire to the
White House by David Sarnoff,
President of NBC. Ideas, unlike
rockets and bombs, are easily
smuggled over borders and quick-
ly passed along.

All of the once proud capitals
of Central and Eastern Europe,
Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Buch-
arest, Sofia are in the Communist
Camp. We cannot in a military
sense fight to get them free of it.
But we can in a cultural sense
keep in touch and we can wait
and use time wisely and hope the
Soviets will use it unwisely, and
perhaps in this way something can
be done to make Khrushchev
lessen his tight grip. In any case,
we are back to our opening point
that the momentary is not the per-
manent state of affairs and this in
itself means the game can go our
way.

‘Red Ties, Socks, Collar Buttons

Label Socalist Profs’ -- Craven

By THORN CRAVEN

Tuesday Columnist
In the Friday Edition last week
there was a letter to the editor
which interested me very much. I’m
not referring to
the one about the
IFC, but the one
from the alumnus
which points out
the socliaistic ten-
dencies which are
becoming evident

the problem. I think that it would be
better to inform you of some of the
things to watch for in professors
who might be suspected of leftist
leanings. Keep your eyes peeled for
these sure fire signs, and we can
avoid that taint of our reputation
which has become so harmful to
places like Berkley and Harvard.

One of the biggest give aways
that _ socialist-leaning-professors
are apt to show is that of clothes.

 

They like to be subtle, so they do
not wear red blazers, or pants
or anything like that. They do,
however, have a weakness for red
ties and collar buttons. Red tee-
shirts are popular among the less
dogmatic socialists, for they give a
slight pink cast to a white shirt.
Be careful not to jump to conclu-
sions in sighting a red tie, how-
ever, but wait until repeated

I can remain silent about a prob-

Think! (Now Not Later)

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

With the intent of relieving tensions and possibly cureing
some of the controversies which beset the student body and the
University at this time, I should like to propose that the fol-
lowing frivilous, ridiculous, and worthless proposals be adopted.

If accepted, they may solve all our problems so we can get
back to our primary objective of being here—passing the
round of tests which face us before Spring Vacation.

I have endeavored to cover every*—
area of controversy and come up
with the “best” solution possible.
My proposals are:

 

document since they are better in-
formed than one or two individuals.
The results should be gratifying.

(4) Since the faculty has been
declared “socialistic”? we should
provide them with facilities for
communal living. Such an ar-
rangement would cut their living
costs, thus allowing the Univer-
sity to cut their salaries, By doing
this the University would have
more money to apply to its build-
ing program. Any professor who
would refuse to forsake wife and
family for communal living should
be burned in effigy and sent to
Princeton for rehabilitation.

(1) Sign Martin
Luther King to
appear at Spring
Dances. By doing
this, King would
be guaranteed a
full house, since
- there is nothing
else to do, and we
would all get to
hear what the
' man has to say.

; (2) Next year,
ane let Coach McHen-
ry write for the R-t P and hire
Steve Henry to coach the basketball
team. In a constant search for jus-
tice, I cannot help but feel that
turn-about is fair play.

(3) Have the Student Body re-
write the constitution and submit it
to Protest for approval. Certainly
such a committee-at-large would be
better able to handle the multitude
of problems involved in that sacred

   

(5) There are two possible solu-
tions for the “fraternity” problem.
A) depledge and deactivate all the
fraternity men and make them
NFU’s. Send all the present non-fra-
ternity men to Williams. Or B) ev-
ery four years initiate the freshmen
class into the various houses and
declare open rush on upperclassmen.

Emmanuel Quate will be pitted
against Richard Bergmann in a table

show headlining Cab Calloway will
round out the program.

Calloway will act as the master-
of-ceremonies and, along with his
band, will provide a musical var-
iety show during the half-time
period of the basketball game.

Captain Clarence Wilson, Meadow-

,| lark Lemon, Murphy Summons and
|| Tex Harrison are the veterans who

continue to shine for the Trotters.
The new players who are help-
ing to round out the already versa-
tile Globetrotters include Jim Rob-
inson, 6-6, former Bradley Univer-
sity center; Willis Thomas, a 6-4
scoring specialist from Tennessee
State University; and Mel Davis, a
6-5 center and guard from the Chi-
cago Majors in the early season.

Other members of the squad in-
clude Davis Hicks, a 6-5, 210
pound New Haven schoolboy sen-
sation; Hubert Ausbie, formerly
one of the nations top scorers as
a 6-4 forward at Philander Smith
College of Little Rock, Arkansas;
and Mannie Jackson, 6-3 once Un-
versity of Illinois basketball cap-
tain.

Since their organization 35 years
ago by Abe Saperstein, the Trotters
have played in 80 countries in all
six continents.

In 1951 they broke the all-time
attendance record for a_ single
basketball game three times.

Tickets may be purchased in Lex-
ington at McCrum’s Drugstore and
the VMI Athletic Office. All seats are
reserved. Prices range from two to
four dollars.

 

 

A nine-game football schedule—
including three contests against
other members of the newly-formed
Collegiate Athletic Conference—is
slated for Washington and Lee this
fall.

The Generals’ schedule was an-
nounced today by Athletic Di-
rector E. P. “Cy” Twombly. In-
cluded are four home contests.

The three conference games are
the last of the W&L season. South-

Baseballers Play Elon, Norfolk,
South Carolina On Spring Trip

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team heads south this year on their
traditional Spring Vacation practice
trip with a veteran team, some
good freshmen, and prayers for hon-
est umpires.

This is all as usual. But the sit-
uation is different this year as

Captain Ned Hobbs

regards the caliber of competition
the Generals will face.

For the first time in some twenty
years, the Generals will be playing
nothing but college ball clubs. Gone

 

from the schedule are such oppon-
ents as Fort Gordon and the Parris
Island Marines.

Army Tough

The practice of playing service
clubs as a warmup to the regular
season originated with Cap’n Dick
Smith, longtime baseball coach and
athletic director here. In recent
years the Generals haven’t fared
too well against the big boys.

Last year, for example, they lost
three games of three at Fort Gordon,
Georgia, which Coach Lyles terms
“the Baltimore Orioles’ Youth Club”
since many of the post’s pitchers
were part of that team’s chain.

The year before that, the Gen-
erals ran into tough sledding at
Parris Island, playing Cornell and
the Marines. This was the trip in
which they had two no-hitters
thrown at them in one day, one by
a Marine righthander, the other
by a pair of Cornell southpay’s.

According to athletic director Cy

Twombly there are two main rea-
sons why the Generals couldn’t get
service competition this spring. First
he blames rumored criticism of the
posts for overemphasizing baseball;
second, there’s no room left on any
of the bases for housing a visiting
ball club.

western at Memphis—returning to
the Generals’ schedule after a five-

will be on the road, while the third
conference opponent, Sewanee, will
come to Lexington.

Formation of the four-member
Collegiate Athletic Conference was
announced in January by W&L
President Fred C. Cole. Members
have athletic programs similar to
Washington and Lee’s non-subsidiz-
ed system.

Washington and Lee has held no
conference memberships since it
withdrew from the Southern Con-
ference in 1958.

Traditional state games with
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
and Emory and Henry will be play-
ed this year.

Besides Southwestern, a second
opponent is listed on the schedule.
A home game on September 29 be-
tween W&L and Lebanon Valley
College of Annville, Pa., will be the
first meeting of the two schools.

Lebanon Valley’s head coach is W&L
alumnus and former center Bill Mc-
Henry, brother of the Generals’
basketball coach, Bob McHenry.

Southwestern and Lebanon Val-
ley replace Frederick College and
Washington University of St.
Louis from the 1960 schedule.

Returning foes for 1962 also in-
clude Johns Hopkins and Franklin
and Marshall, both Lexington games.

The Generals will carry a 19-game
unbeaten streak into their first en-
counter next season when they meet
Hampden-Sydney. Last year, W&L
posted a 9-0-0 record in the eighth
year of the university’s non-sub-
sidized athletic program.

from college fees during the year
following the award, or the option
of $60 in cash.

The winners will be announced on
the June commencement program.
Entries receiving awards will be-
come the property of the university.

Prose entries may be short stories,
literary criticisms, biographical stu-
dies, plays, or informal essays, at
least 1500 words in length. Poems
must be at least 30 lines, which may
consist of selections.

Last year two junior prose awards
were given, to Bond Johnson and
Ron Alenstein; an exception was
made to allow both to receive
awards. The freshman prose award
was won by Paul Van Avery, and
no sophomore prose award was
made. Poetry awards were won by
William Chaplin and C. P. White.

The Mahan Awards were estab-
lished under the will of George A.
Mahan of Hannibal, Missouri, who
died in 1936.

Further contest rules are posted
on bulletin boards.

Friday the Generals meet the Pi-
rates of East Carolina College in
Greenville, N. C. Saturday they
play the Monarchs of Norfolk Col-
lege, in Norfolk.

Only three games of the spring
trip, the ones with Elon, East Car-
olina, and Norfolk, will count in
the season’s record. This suits team
coach Joe Lyles just fine.

“IT look at it this way,” Lyles
said. “We’re naturally playing to
win, but this trip is the only chance
I've got to see what some of these
boys can do in a game before we
get down to regular season play.

Competition
“We'd rather play South Caro-
lina than some of the smaller

schools because it’s better competi-
tion. I want to see what they can
do under fire.”

He’ll have very little chance to
see that before the Generals leave.
There’s a scrimmage scheduled for
Saturday against VMI, weather and
the condition of the fields permitting.
Springfield (Massachusetts) College
comes into town next week to play
both the local college teams as often
as possible in a week’s time. They'll
scrimmage against the Generals and
the Keydets in what amounts to
their southern trip.

Lyles expects to go into both
contests in fairly good shape as
far as the team goes. The boys
haven't been outside much, and
this is a crying need, but with luck
and some sunshine they'll move
out soon.,

The only other thing the coach
is bemoaning is the fact that he
has just two catchers, senior Jim
Russ and freshman Ashley Allen.
He’d like to find at least one more
backstop, and a few more pitchers,
before the long haul starts.

Honts Suggests Motto;
Best Solution Is To Think

(Continued from page 2)

Certainly men who have been here
for 2-3-4 years know which houses
they are interested in and the fresh-
men won’t know each other well
enough to permit dirty rush to go
on. Another advantage of this
change is that Help Week could be
moved to the time slot now occupied
by Freshman Camp, thus eliminat-
ing two probable evils from the
present calendar.

6) Give unlimited cuts to all men
who made less than a 1.0 grade-point
average and allow Dean’s List stu-
dents to have no cuts at all. The
point of this change is obvious.

Now. Anyone who sees any

sense in these six ideas is an ob-
vious candidate for the nut house.
However, they are not a lot more
ridiculous than some of the gales
of hot air which have been floating
about for the past month or six
weeks. May I suggest a motto for
the day? THINK.

Next week I hope to have a solu-
tion for the week-end weather
problem.

Chase will also swim in the breast-

Swimming with Wolfe in the dis-
ance events will be Ernest Williams

Walt McManus, normally a dis-
tance man, is expected to make a
good showing in the 100 yard but-
terfly.

nicely into two parts, Dr. Jones
said.) The first act develops from
the beginning in Venice to the point
where Iago has successfully planted
jealousy in Othello’s mind. The sec-
ond half shows the results of that
action.

“Othello is a very tightly con-
structed play. There are no sub-
plots. From the inception of jeal-
ousy the action will move swiftly
to catastrophe,” Dr. Jones conclud-
ed.

The show is to run Wednesday
through Saturday. Curtain time for
each performance is 8:15 p.m. Re-

is often a big clue to their subcon-
scious thoughts. If you happen to be
tailing some professor and he shows
a marked tendency to turn left at
every corner, you should make note
of it. This is particularly dangerous
if the left turns are taken into one
way streets, for a traffic hazzard is
almost as bad as a political one.

Of course, the most likely place
to spot a potential plotter against
the government, university, fra-
ternities, and McCrum’s is the class-
room. Here is where professors give
themselves away most easily. For it
is hard for them to keep their true
leanings out of the lectures. This
is also the hardest place to catch
them, however, for it involves list-
ening to the lectures. I do not rec-
ommend this for freshmen, for all
too often lack of experience affords
the slippery socialist a loop hole.

The last place revolutionary fer-
ment is likely to be detected is,
unfortunately, inaccessable to stu-
dent spies. This, of course, is the
faculty meetings. Therefore, it is
always to be alert at the Co-op
and Doc’s where these meetings
are most likely to be continued.

I can not encourage you in hunt-
ing down subversive looking profes-
sors too much. And I can not let you
go on thinking that they do not
exist here at good old W&L. So get
out and start searching. Remember
that there was even a chink in the
