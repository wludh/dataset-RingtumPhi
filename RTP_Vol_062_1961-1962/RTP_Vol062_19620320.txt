Christian Top Choice In Presidential Poll

By JACK DeJARNETTE
Tuesday Writer

“Who do you think will be the
likely candidates for the next presi-
dent of the student body?”

“Why do you think that your
choice is a likely candidate?”

In a poll conducted yesterday by
members of the staff of the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi, 19 of the 31 stu-
dents polled had a definite idea or
preference. Many had no idea that
elections were coming up next
month.

Of the 12 students who had no
idea or preference about the voting,
9 said that they simply did not know
who would be a likely candidate,
and the other three said that they
did not care because it “...makes no
difference.”

Of the possible candidates men-
tioned, Meade Christian, Phi Gam
junior, received 8 votes, or 25 per
cent of those cast.

Next was Tim Ireland, Interme-
diate Law School student, who re-
ceived 7 votes, or 22 per cent of
those cast.

Several people mentioned the pos- |

Twelve of the students polled who
had no opinion in the poll represent
38 per cent, a greater percentage
than any of the candidates received.

Interviews were conducted in the
Co-Op, the Library, on the street,
and by telephone.

There were the usual “party lin-
ers” and “fraternity brother of
mine” answers, but more than one
person crossed party line.

Arnold Masinter, Phi Ep senior,
said that he predicted Tim Ireland
would get the vote because “He will
get party backing. He is the top
man in the Law School. We have al-
ready established a precedence in

who were polled:

John Refo, Sigma Chi junior, said
that “It could be Christian, Ireland,
Montgomery, or Butler. It’s pretty
much up for grabs in both parties.”

Ron Allenstein, ZBT senior, said
of Christian, “I think that his quali-
fications are outstanding as far as
grades and extra-curricular activ-
ities are concerned. I think only a
boy of his ability could maintain
high grades while participating in
the activities that he does.”

Tom Budd, Phi Gam, law student,
simply said, “Christian—he’s the
most qualified.”

Phil Sharp, SAE law school fresh-
man, said, “Tim Ireland. I think
that anybody who knows Tim and
knows what he has done in his
six years at W&L can see that his
qualifications would make him the
likely choice. I think that he could
win.”

Delt Junior, Tom Andrew, said
he thought that either Christian or
McCord would win. He added fur-
ther that he thought the Indepen-
dent Party man would win the elec-

 

tion because, “There isn’t anyone
around for the University Party.”

George Summers, Independent
sophomore, said Christian would win
because, “He’s a good guy and he is
a member of the EC. He can win on
the other side as he proved last
year in the election.”

Terry Fohs, Delt junior, said, “Bob
Payne will win because he has the
qualifications.”

Jud Babcock, SAE junior, predict- | §

ed that Lanny Butler would win be-
cause, “He’s serious and level-head-
ed and that is important. His per-
sonality commands leadership. His
ideas are good. Because he is an
undergraduate he is in closer contact
with the student body as a whole.
He understands the problems of the
student body.”

Walt McManus, Phi Psi sopho-
more, speaking of Dave Montgomery
said, “You can’t beat his all-around
qualifications. He excels everywhere
in student life.”

Phi Delt junior Dave Swann said,
“Tim Ireland is the man for the
job. He is head dorm counselor. He

Executive Committee Passes Dance Set Plan

 

Friday Parties
To Be Closed
On Dance Sets

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

The IFC last night passed a
resolution limiting the combos
of fraternities on Friday nights
of dance set weekends. The
proposal will become a part of
the IFC constitution.

The proposal was submitted to
the IFC by Ross Kyger and Tony
Schlesinger, juniors. The new rules
are designed to eliminate a large
amount of conflict that exists be-
teween fraternity combos and Uni-
versity sponsored dance functions.

The proposal as passed by the
IFC stated:

1) All fraternity combo parties
held in conflict with University
sponsored dances on Friday nights
of University dance weekends will
be closed. Closed is to be defined
as members of one fraternity only
and the party shall be held in the
house of that fraternity.

2) No fraternity may compel one
of its members to pay an extra
social assessment for said combo
to be held in conflict with a Uni-
versity sponsored dance if that
member wishes to attend the
dance instead of the combo party.

3) Enforcement of the above
shall be administered directly by
the IFC judiciary committee. All
violations shall be dealt with in
as severe manner as possible.

The proposal was passed by a 15

to 0 vote.
IFC Action

This action on the part of the IFC
is designed to eliminate as much as
possible conflict with University
sponsored dance functions. This mo-
tion was designed to discourage fra-
ternity parties during the time of
University dance functions but still
allow fraternity parties for those
who desire them.

The motion will be voted upon |
next week and its approval will |

make it a permanent part of the IFC
Constitution.

This plan will not go into effect |
until next year. Direct results of the |
proposal will not be realized until |
the plan has had a chance to be put
into practice over a period of time.

It was pointed out that fraternity
parties would be able to be opened

following the end of University
dances

Barlier this month the IFC turned
down a proposal that would have
entirely banned fraternity combos
during University dance functions.
It wan felt that this proposal would

Executive Committee Meetings

To Be Opened To Press

By KEN

Associate Editor

A constitutional amendment to replace dance set presi-
dents with class presidents was passed by the EC in last night’s

meeting.

The office of President of Fancy Dress, however, will con-
tinue to be elected by the Student Body in the Spring elections.

The Committee also voted

to open its meetings to press

representation, though reserving the right to privacy at its own

discretion.
A proposal made by Sigma Delta*®
Chi, the professional journalism

society, to have the motion submit-
ted as an amendment to the con-
stitution was unanimously voted
down, however.

The plan for revision of the dance
set presidents was presented by
Senior Executive Committeeman,
Steve Galef, President of the Dance
Board.

Under this plan, the President
of the Sophomore class along with
the other officers and any vice
presidents that he might need

shall conduct Openings Dance

group. shall conduct Springs

dent and his group shall conduct

The amendment was accepted by
a vote of 8 for and 4 against, thus
just barely gaining the required
two-thirds majority.

Voting for the amendment were
Christian, Roberts, Ogilvie, Boiar-
sky, Galef, Robrecht, MceThenia, and
Suttle.

The EC measure to have press
representation was _ introduced
earlier this year through a request
made by Ring-tum Phi Editor,
Roy Goodwin.

The motion will go into effect as
of next Monday night’s meeting.

The EC on the other hand vot-
ed down the Sigma Delta Chi pe-
tition to make press representation
an official part of the student body
constitution.

(The proposal was not presented
in the form of an amendment, but
as a statement of the organiza-
tion’s stand against the EC’s se-
crecy. However, since the consti-
tution specifically designates those
permitted to attend EC meetings,
the petition had to be considered
a proposed amendment.—Ed.)

The petition read as follows:

Sigma Delta Chi, professional
journalistic society, strongly urges
that hereafter you open all legis-
lative meetings of the Committee
to the general public and to the
press.

We believe that if student
government is to be truly re-
sponsible to those whom it repre-
sents, its meetings should be open
to its constituents.

a

We believe that if a government
is to be truly democratic, its pro-
ceedings should be discussed as
widely as possible.

Opening meetings in this way
would not rule out the possibili-
ty of the Committee’s going into
executive session when necessary.

We do not attack the integrity
of the Executive Committee at
Washington and Lee, but we feel
it is our position as responsible
journalists to combat secrecy at all
levels of government.

We therefore request that these
meetings be open to the public
and the press.

Soviets Use Mass Media For Own Purposes

By MR. O. W. RIEGEL
Professor of Journalism

The basic function of the press,
broadcasting, and other media in the
Soviet Union—to advance the poli-
cies and goals of the Communist
state as those policies and goals are
determined by the political leader-
ship—is well enough known to re-
quire no elaboration here.

It may be of interest, however, to
point out some of the reasons for
the development of the Soviet sys-
tem, briefly describe the present
state of communications in the So-
viet Union and comment on recent
changes which are already modify-
ing Soviet life and which may bring

Another Look
At Recent Proposals

The proposals that have been made concerning the dance
set presidents and the IFC president seem to be diametrically
opposed to each other. On the one hand the dance set propos-
als will remove some of the politics from the “Big Seven” and
class elections, while on the other hand, the IFC president pro-
posals will only replace it with more.

We concur with the Friday Edition in the opinion that the
replacement of the dance set president with a class president

has ‘‘considerable merit.”

Under this plan the class presidents

would become more than mere political officers with only
nominal duties and could possibly receive more student co-op-
eration. Perhaps Openings and Springs could even become
unofficial class weekends, as Finals is destined to become.
In any case we heartily agree with the proposal and the Exec-
utive Committee’s decision to accept it.

As we stated in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi, the
move to elect the IFC president is basically a sound
idea. There are considerations, however, which must be
taken into account to give an over-all picture. We must
also remember that there are two sides to any question
thus we feel we should give the other viewpoint held by

some students.

To make the Interfraternity Council president a Spring
election office is both unrealistic and unnecessary. It is un-
realistic to believe that to take the election out of the IFC and
put it before the entire campus will involve less politics. If
anything, it will bring more politics into play. One provision of
the proposal is that any upperclassman can run for the office,
whether he has had previous experience in the IFC or not.

It seems essential to have some knowledge of the opera-
tion of the IFC before becoming president of it, just as the
presidency of any organization requires some familiarity with

it.

It is also obvious that any time an elective office is
placed before a large group, more pressure is exerted
from all sides and more factors come into play than the
candidates’ qualifications alone.

An even greater consideration is the nature of the IFC
itself. The Interfraternity Council is a representative organi-
zation without direct student membership.

Just as the United States Congress is a representative body
and, as such, elects its own head in the person of the Speaker,
so the IFC represents the fraternities as a whole, and the indi-
vidual representatives are in the best position to elect their

sador from Spain, now deceased,
made a speech in Lexington a few
weeks ago in which he said that
it is the duty of government to
control freedom of speech and
press when such freedom would
lead to subversion, a statement to
which the Soviet government
could also subscribe.

The wish to control communica-
tions for special purposes is, in fact,
a universal phenomenon. It is the
editing principle of most political,
religious, educational, and business
organisms, and is justified by such
socially accepted words and phrases
as “education,” “responsibility,”
“national security,” or “liberty but
not license.”

The West has been protected
against some of the more extreme
of the stultifying effects of this ed-
iting principle by pluralism (diver-
sified groups contradicting and com-
batting each other) and by a body of
information professionals who in
in theory, if not always in practice,
dispassionately report the facts and
do not compromise this goal by
serving whatever political, economic,
or social interests happen to have
power at the time.

Neither of these safeguards oper-
ate effectively in the Soviet Union,
where what is quaintly known as
“the free market-place of ideas” ex-
ist only in those areas which offer no
challenge to the basic system of gov-
ernment or to the security of the
state.

The makers of the Revolution
were well aware that their suc-
cess depended ultimately upon
their ability to win the consent, or
at least to prevent the active op-
position, of a mass population in
which existed a great deal of ig-
norance and lethargy. For this
reason, the leaders of the Revolu-
tion placed an exceptionally high
value on mass media as a partner,
along with personal influence, po-
lice power and other controls, in
the building of the new state.

Although it might be argued that
personal contact, through the vast
network of workers in the Agitation
and Propaganda Department of the
Communist Party, has carried the
main load of “political education,”
there is ample evidence of the very
special regard of Soviet leadership
for mass media, based upon their
effectiveness and relative cheapness
as instruments of control.

The rapid elimination of illiteracy
(the Soviet Union has now one of
the highest literacy rates in the
world) is evidence of the priority
concern of leadership for preparing
a mass population capable of being
a consumer of mass media. Lenin,
inspired Pravda (“truth”) in 1912,
Stalin was editor of Pravda in 1917,
and “journalists” have always been
represented in the highest echelons
of policy-making, including member-
ship in the Central Committee and
Presidium of the Party and top po-
sitions as formulators of official
doctrine.

Another example of the special
solicitude of the Soviet state for
mass media is the remarkable de-
velopment during the 1920’s of the
motion picture, a medium that Lenin

Ww

recognized at an early date as in-
comparable for reaching a mass pop-
ulation with maximum effect.

Another example is the devel-
opment of a number of special
schools for journalists, both to
prepare students for professional
careers and to provide refresher
courses for practicing journalists.
Another example is the high de-
gree of saturation in communica-
tion achieved in a vast country,
with a population of more than
200,000,000, with what seems, in
terms of this country, a relative-
ly modest investment in the mach-
inery, physical network, and labor
of communications,

This saturation is achieved by a
variety of channels and media rang-
ing from the All-Union radio and
television networks to the ubiqui-
tous wall newspapers posted in fac-
tories and clubs all over the country.

It must be remembered that in the
Soviet Union communications start-
ed from scratch with the Revolution,
and that the number, location, and
role of newspapers, broadcasting
stations, magazines, and_ theaters
have all been carefully planned to
arrive at a maximum of availability
and penetration with a minimum
of expense, duplication, and waste.
This is difficult to comprehend in a
country like the United States, in
which these media appear willy nil-
ly, fight each other in bitter com-
petition, duplicate each other, and
frequently give up the ghost, with
attendant waste and displacement
of labor, as is happening now not-
ably in the case of magazines and
motion picture theaters.

The contrast is dramatic between
the advantages of freedom of en-
terprise and the disadvantages of
waste, as in the case of the United
States, and the advantages of ra-
tionalized planning and the disad-
vantages of monolithic control, as in
the case of the Soviet Union.

While there is nothing unique
in the Soviet employment of. com-
munications for political purposes,
there is no doubt but that the pe-
culiar paragon of Marxist-Lenin-
ist ideology employed by Soviet
publications gives them a weird,
unearthly sound (“crazy man”)
to most Americans. We are also
repelled by the sameness of Soviet
publications, their generally dead-
ly seriousness, their avoidance of
expression of any basic political
criticism, their lack of ingenuity
in physical appearance, and their
lack of liveliness resulting from
the omission of many kinds of
news sought by many western
readers.

The Soviet journalist has tradi-
tionally argued that when a man
gets drunk and bashes in the head
of his mistress with a monkey
wrench, it is a random accident of
the human condition but not news.
If the same man gets drunk and
throws his monkey wrench into the
main generator of the Dnieperstory
power plant, interrupting and sabo-
taging Soviet production, it is news,
and the culprit will receive appro-

 

priate publicity, including notice of
his fate.

w

Other circumstances account for
the peculiar flavor of the Soviet
press. Born in revolution and de-
veloping during its early years in
an atmosphere of fear of counter-
revolution and invasion, the press
not surprisingly acquired some of
the neurotic habits of a beleaguered
state, including suspicion, fear of
disclosure, and an austerity of ob-
session with defense. These qualities
were only intensified by the author-
itarianism and fear of the Stalin
epoch.

Also, the Soviet press has not been
immune from some of the neurotic
effects of a national inferiority com-
plex, including touchiness and a
strident insistence upon the right-
ness of the Soviet rationale of “free-
dom of the press” and the correct-
ness of Soviet professional practices.

The Soviet press, of course, does
not seem as weird, dull and unin-
formative to the Soviet citizen as
it does to the western observer.
The Soviet reader is used to the
vocabulary; I suspect he is adept
at deciphering the twists and turns
of current events from the materi-
al offered to his eyes and ears.

Moreover, since Stalin’s death in
1953, and especially since the con-
demnation of Stalinism by Khru-
schev at the 20th Party Congress in
1956, there have been portentous
changes in both the theory and
practice of mass media operation in
the Soviet Union. The dissatisfaction
of leadership (and presumably of the
consumer) with the dullness and
doctrinaire character of the mass
media has come much more into the
open. -

Khruschev’s own son-in-law, Al-
eksei I. Adzhubei, editor of Izvestia
(News), national newspaper of the
central government, has been espec-
ially vocal in criticizing the stodgi-
ness of the press and its lack of
imagination and courage, and has
brightened Izvestia in content and
appearance. While his changes seem
hardly revolutionary to western
eyes, they do represent a change of
course. They are apparently well re-
ceived, as the circulation of Izves-

Americans Must Rearm Their

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

The sentiments of Mr. Lowry’s
letter published last Friday and,
indeed, the whole recent peace push
by Protest are well-meant but
wholly unreasonable.

Mr. Lowry and his adherents do
us a good service in underlining the
terrible danger of extermination, but
I am sick and tired of hearing how
many square feet of American soil
a 50 megaton bomb could incinerate.
The histerical—from Lord Russell to
Lowry, will paint the tragedy in
ghastly terms, and then add, with
a final flourish, “can you possibly
conceive of what will happen?” I
should answer, “Well, I suppose so
many acres of soil would go up.
When a bomb falls, it usually ex-
plodes.”

In other words, I have accepted
calmly a premonition that the Uni-
ted States will experience nuclear
devastation in a decade or so. How
can I be calm? Well, I know this is
banal patriotism, but I am calm be-
cause I have a basic faith in our
people, a faith remote from ideal-
ism, that is rooted in the fiber and
blood of other Americans, a faith
that we will snap back from de-
struction.

What will be left afterwards—

 

namely, the country—will have been
worth dying for. “‘Ah” say the pa-
cifists. What will be left worth any-
thing? What can a citizen do against
the Bomb? If I recall correctly, a
number of civilians in the last war
did a great deal for themselves with
precious little left to them—wheth-
er they were in Fastung Europa

 

or across the Channel from it. Re-
member the R.A.F.? Remember the
London air wardens, the Maquis, the
common Frenchman or German
who secretly made the V-for-Vic-
tory in his heart whenever Allied
bombs fell?

We had pacifists before the sec-
ond War. They moralized and
mouthed impressively about peace
right up until 2403 servicemen died
at Pearl Harbor. Shortly afterwards,
Roosevelt did not advise Congress
that “thou shall not kill,” rather he
curtly mentioned that “Yesterday,
December 7, 1941, a date which will
live in infamy, the United States of
America was suddenly and delib-
erately attacked.” It can, and I fear,
will happen again soon. Perhaps this

 

time around the pacifists can be
silenced and so ease the shock of
“surprise.”

How can one think of peace when
one knows that a sizeable portion
of humanity would like, at least in
theory, to wipe the US. off the
map? They may well try. One morn-
ing, or one evening, Bombs will

fall and cities will vanish, and
Americans will have to take it. Our
mettle will be severely tested. But
in the name of God, or anything
else you hold sacred, do not hold
that we will be automatically de-
feated or destroyed. To so think or
speak is treason.

The world will exist after the
blasts cease. The injury will be
close, deep, and personal. The risk
involved for each American citi-
zen will be approximately that of
a combat soldier on patrol. If one
can keep one’s wits sharpened, and
use common sense mixed with the
usual ever-present cock-sure bra-
vado, then chances for survival will
be good. The survivors will not ov-
erly grieve that one out of every

Indomitable Spirit

four Americans died in the attack,
they will concentrate on the three
who lived. It would be an unusual
world, and one not entirely unpleas-
ant. New cities would be built, free
from tradition, constructed for wis-
er, stronger, perhaps sadder, (and
fewer) people.

Science would be hard-pressed to
restore a high national standard of
living, and would probably succeed
in a decade or so. Certain prob-
lems—birth control and population
explosion, for instance—would no
longer exist (though they could re-
cur); and there would be a strong,
healthy impetus to make a newer
and a better world. “We lived
through that,” a philosopher of the
post-Atomic Renaissance might say,
“We have stood our test of fire and

amazed at the new world that is

There are people, I suppose, who
fiendishly hope that the sky will
fall. They suffer a martyr complex
that has its roots in selfishness. The
more rational among us must stop
acting like spolied children who nib-

pablum. World Peace is impossible,
a contradiction in terms so long

 

as we believe in co-operative com-
petition (capitalist, of course) and
they condone a mass conquest, moral
and physical, resulting in oblitera-

Don’t be absurd.

We have been taught to fear not
God but the Reds. Worst of all, the
pacifists are bringing us around to
believe that we must all die... and
die as cowards. Words no longer

WEL Looks At Communism

Eighth In A Series

This is the eighth in a series of nine
articles by members of the Washington
and Lee faculty dealing with commun-
ism and its various aspects.

Professor O. W. Riegel’s article,
Mass Media in the Soviet Union, dis-
cusses the basic function of the press,
broadcasting, and other media in the
Soviet Union; analyzes the present state
of communications, and comments on
how recent communication changes are
already modifying Soviet Life.

Next Week: Dr.

 

a ii represents, in a sense,
the new, post Stalin Soviet man,
journalistic variety, with an interest
in innovation and a freer intellect-
ual climate. Also as we could ob-
serve on his visits to this country,
he has a more hearty, western-type
openness and give-and-take in his
personal behavior than the old style
journalist.

The change in climate shows it-
self in a variety of ways. One is
the abolition of direct censorship
of foreign press correspondents,
an event that occurred last
spring, although correspondents
may still be lectured and even ex-
pelled for actions by their news-
papers considered objectionable by
the Soviet Union.

Another is an increased interest
in a wider variety of programming
in Soviet television. Another is the
willingness of the Soviet Union to
exchange propaganda in the mass
media, as occurred recently when
Adzhubei’s interview with President

‘Kennedy was published in Izvestia,

and which may occur shortly in
television with an exchange of pro-
grams by heads of state.

Another sign of change is what
appears to be a current campaign to
make increased use of the so-called
“rabselkor,” a made-up word mean-

Leon F. Sensa-

 

ing worker-peasant correspondent.
The USSR claims to have more than
a million of the rabselkor, who are
supposed to send regular corres-
pondence to newspapers to report
on deficiencies in Soviet life, and,
incidentally, give the government a
kind of continuous Gallup poll of
public satisfaction and dissatisfac-
tion.

There is also evidence that pro-
fessional Soviet journalists look
upon these amateur newspaper
writers with some hostility. Prav-
da reports having received 325,-
640 letters from readers in 1961,
and Izvestia, 211,379.

I recall a visit to the printing
plant of Izvestia in Moscow in 1935
when a special visa was required to
pass each of the fully armed Red
Army soldiers stationed at the door
of each of the inside rooms of the
building, and when the excellent
German presses were operated by
peasant women in peasant costume
whose technical incompetence was
acknowledged. Improvement in poli-
tical climate and in technical pro-
ficiency since that time has been
great.

The Soviet Union, of course, is
anything but a free society in the
communications field. All of the
tools of publication in any medi-
um, the transmitters and the pres-
ses, belong to the state. Broad-
casting is government operated.
Newspapers and magazines are
published by labor unions and
various kinds of societies as well
as by government and Party, but
their basic political conformity is
assured by the manner in which
their staffs are selected.

One thing is certain, and that is
that no channel of communication in
the USSR is owned by any individ-
ual, How far the new spirit of inno-
vation and criticism can go under
such conditions is a question, but it
would certainly appear to have very
definite limits without a change in
the country’s political structure.

The basic question for evalua-
tion, really, is how well informed,
and how capable of understanding

VMI ‘Trounces Generals
In Pre-Season Contest;
Pitching Weak Link

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

W&L’s baseball team should play West Virginia at

Morgantown again this year.
They got their practice in

cold-weather competition Sat-

urday on Smith Field, in a scrimmage with V.M.I.

 

Three Swimmers

Place High
In State AAU

By LOUIS MONGEAU
Assistant Sports Editor
Washington and Lee swimmers
William Broaddus, Walter McManus
and John Wolfe all placed in the
finals of the Virginia A.A.U. meet at

Fort Lee, Saturday.

William Broaddus, freshman,
managed a fourth and fifth in the
100 and 200 yard _ backstroke
events.

Walter McManus, sophomore,
placed third and sixth in the 200 and
100 yard butterfly, respectively.

The 200 yard event provided the
unfortunate humor of the meet
when the rope used to stop false
starts fell on McManus who was at
that point challenging for second.

The ensuing confusion caused the
race to be stopped. It was swum
over ten minutes later.

John Wolfe, this year’s freshman
standout, placed fifth in both the
200 and 400 yard freestyle events.

However, Wolfe and McManus
were forced to leave early prevent-
ing them competing in the finals of
one of each of their events. Conse-
quently, Wolfe was ranked fifth in
the 200 yard freestyle and McManus
was ranked sixth in the 100 yard

(Continued on page 4)

 

Unfortunately for the Generals’
cause, the weather wasn’t the only
thing that was cold. So were the
pitchers and the hitters, and the
end result was a 15-6 loss.

However, coach Joe Lyles isn’t
worried about the score in these
scrimmage games. He’s out to im-
prove the team before the opener at
Elon March 31, and “the only way
to get better is to play; against com-
petition, not just squad games.
That’s why we’re doing it.”

All the scoring in Saturday’s
scrimmage came in big innings.
The Keydets got ten runs in the
second inning, and five in the fifth.
The Generals’ six came on five
in the third and one in the sixth.

But Lyles found a few encourag-
ing signs in the ball game. He
singled out Brice Gamber and Jim
Gwinn as the best-looking of the
four pitchers he used in the ball
game. It just wasn’t good weather
for pitchers. It was too cold for them
to throw hard, and thus be effective.

Ned Hobbs came in for his share
of the coach’s scant praise, due to
a triple. Jim Russ drew some for his
home run in the Generals’ big third
inning. And third baseman Chuck
Lane looked good on one play, when
he made a diving stop of a smash
to his left and threw the runner
out at first.

Prospects

Lyles played his freshman pros-
pects in the last two innings of the
abbreviated contest. “They made a
lot of mistakes, but that’s why we

Game Set For 4 On Wednesday

 

Aussie All-Stars To Face Generals

Enter Game

With 1-1 Record

By JUD REIS
Assistant Sports Editor

The All-Australian lacrosse
team arrived on campus yes-
terday, having compiled a 1-1
record in American competi-
tion to date.

Thursday the Aussies trounced
Duke’s Blue Devils 14-5, but lost
Saturday, 19-15, to the strongest
UVA team in many years.

Coach Bob McHenry, who scout-
ed the UVA game for W&L, said the
Australian All-Stars were not only
fast, but had excellent stickwork.
Their game centers around forcing
their opponents into crucial errors.
The Aussies, used to playing a game
which allows no substitution, are in
excellent condition.

Griffin Scores

Their high scorer is crease man
Bryan Griffin, number 8. He scored
six against Duke and five against
UVA. W&L Co-Captain Bart Mit-
chell will be defending against Grif-
fin in Wednesday afternoon’s game.
Aussie Captain Don Miller and
Vice-Captain Allan Pierce both
played against W&L in the lacrosse
team’s Australian tour in 1959.

Line-Up

The starting line-up for tomor-
row’s game runs as follows: Attack,
Klingelhofer, Hankey, and either
Snead, Michaeles, or Andrew. Mid-
field, Gummey, Wooten and McDan-
iel. Defense, Co-Captains Mitchell

 

 

A group of the

 

and Wheeler, and either Reed or
Van Rensselaer.

Plagued by goalie problems, Mc-
Henry has finally decided on ex-
creaseman Ray Miller. Miller, after
only a week’s experience, will make
his game debut tomorrow. Accord-
ing to McHenry the senior stickman
has progessed quickly and should
fill the gap in the Generals’ defense.

After meeting W&L the Austral-
ian All-Stars will play some of the
nation’s top teams including Mary-
land, Johns Hopkins, the Baltimore
Lacrosse Club, the Philadelphia La-
crosse Club, Princeton, Rutgers,
Army and Navy.

EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

A great deal of nonsense has been written about educational
television. Following is my contribution:

It has been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour’
every day at 4 a.m. This excellent show is followed at 5 a.m.
by “Kierkegaard Can Be Fun.” For such lazy seamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth.”

So much for the myth that TV gives no prime time to educa-
tional programs. Now let us deflate another canard: that TV
is not eager to inject intellectual content in all its programs.

If you have sat, as I have sat, with a television planning
board, you would know that the opposite is true. I was priv-
ileged recently to witness a meeting of two of TV’s topmost
program developers—both named Binkie Tattersall.

“Binkie,” said Binkie to Binkie, “if there is one thing I
am bound and determined, it’s that we’re going to have intel-
lectual content in next season’s programs.”

“Right!” replied Binkie. “So let us put on our thinking
caps and go to work.”

“T forgot my thinking cap in Westport,” said Binkie, “but
I have a better notion: let us light a Marlboro.”

“But of course!” cried Binkie. ‘Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get comfortable?”

“T said Marlboro,” answered Binkie. ‘Weren’t you listening?’

“A full-flavored smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.

“Rich tobacco, pure white filter, a choice of pack or box.
What is better than a Marlboro?”

“A Marlboro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one?”

Binkie had, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got comfortable and proceeded to cerebrate.

“First of all,’ said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old
clichés. We will have no domestic comedies, no westerns, no
private eyes, no deep sea divers, no doctors, and no lawyers.”

“Right!” said Binkie. ‘Something offbeat.”

“That’s the word—offbeat,” said Binkie.

They smoked and cerebrated.

“You know,” said Binkie, “there has never been a series
about the Coast and Geodetic Survey.”

“Or about glass blowers,” said Binkie.

They fell into a long, torpid silence.

“You know,” said Binkie, “there’s really nothing wrong with

’

 

 

PP ea? 2

 

A Gabo adeeb ser diver cidh-r bw doer Ysa?

a cliché situation —provided, of course, it’s offbeat.”

“Right!” said Binkie. “So let’s say we do a series about a
guy who’s a family man with a whole bunch of lovable kids
who play merry pranks on him.”

“Yeah, and he’s also a cowboy,” said Binkie.

“And a deep sea diver,” said Binkie.

“With a law degree,” said Binkie.

“Plus an M.D.,” said Binkie.

“And he runs a detective age ney,’ said Binkie.

“Binkie,”

They shook hands silently, not trusting themselves to speak,
and lit Marlboros and settled back to relax, for Marlboro is a
cigarette not only for cerebration, but for settling back with

said Binkie to Binkie, “we’ve done it again!”

Noell Is Best Debater

Bill Noell, W&L sophomore from
Bluefieldfi W. Va., took top honors
as the best debater at the District
VIL Regional Debate Tournament
held Friday and Saturday in Wil-
liamsburg.

Taking first place out of a field
of 60 condidates, Noell sparked the
W&L team to an overall ninth place
out of 30 colleges in the contest.

Al Eckes, another sophomore, tied
for fourth place.

The teams were judged on the
basis of eight rounds of strength
meets strength debate.

District VII is one of the strongest
debate areas in the country.

Teams included in the area are
Princeton, King’s and Georgetown.

Dr. King In Lynchburg

For those who are interested, Dr.
Martin Luther King will speak in
Lynchburg next Tuesday night.

Speaking at the E. C. Glass Au-
ditorium at 8 p.m., the controver-
sial Negro leader will speak on
“Non-Violence.”

Dr. King made headlines at W&L
recently when he was refused the
right to speak here.

Dr. Colvin Speaks Tonight

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, will
speak tonight on “German Foreign
Policy.”

Speaking in duPont Auditorium at
7:30 p.m., Dr. Colvin will draw at-
tention to Germany’s role to the
East-West struggle for power.

Physics Professor Here

Dr. Peter van de Kamp will be in
Lexington Wednesday and Thursday
to lecture to physics classes at
VMI and W&L. He will also give a
public lecture on “The Milky Way
System” in VMI’s Mallory Hall at 8
p.m. March 21.

A native of the Netherlands, Dr.
van de Kamp has recently received
degrees from the University of Ut-
recht and the University of Cali-
fornia.

In addition to teaching at Swarth-
more, U. Va., and Harvard, Dr. van
de Kamp has lectured at leading
universities in France, Germany and
Holland.

 

Concert Wednesday Night

A concert given by the Blue Ridge
Chamber Music Players will be held

Hf

Wednesday night at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel.

Both new and old music will be
performed at the concert, and fea-
tured will be the playing of “Draw-
ings Set No. 3” by Sydney Hodkin-
son, composer and clarinetist of the
group.

Other members of the Players are
Anne McClenny, Elizabeth Despor-
tes, and Roger Taylor.

Admission to the concert is free.
A reception will be held in the Com-
mons after the program.

Captain Hall Transferred

Captain Hugh J. Hall, of W&L’s
ROTC Department, recently re-
ceived orders transferring him to
duty in South Viet Nam.

Although his duty in Viet Nam
has not been precisely stipulated, it
is assumed that he will serve as a
member of the U.S. Military As-
sistance and Advisory Group.

Captain Hall has been the instruc-
tor of the MS III cadets at W&L
for the last three years. Previously
he served with the 7th Cavalry
Regiment in Japan.

Capt. Hall will leave Lexington
about April 28th to report to Fort
Bragg, N.C., for a four-week Spe-
cial Warfare Course.

The course will prepare him for
his Viet Nam duty to follow immed-
iately thereafter.

play, to correct them.” Ashley Al-
len now seems to be a good prospect
as second-string catcher behind the
veteran Russ, and Bob Taylor, a
right fielder, impressed with his left-
handed power hitting. Braxton Tabb
looks good at first base, and Jim
Boardman is a strong candidate at
second.

 

Pitching

The key, though, is going to be the
team’s pitching.

Two of Lyles’ righthanders, Penn
Way and Rosie Page, have quit, and
he’s left with only six pitchers. One
of these, Jim Gwinn, hasn’t thrown
a ball in competition for two years.
Three are freshmen; Louie Paterno,
Mason McGowin, and Chris Wigert.
They look good so far, but haven’t
really been under fire yet.

And there are two veterans, Phil
Sharp and Gamber.

The team will spend this week
scrimmaging against the “A” and
“B” squads of Springfield College.

leveled. Why? As good arguments
for the theory that history repeats
itself, I quote in modern context
what is common’ knowledge—in
1962 the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself, and the world can no
longer endure half free and _ half
slave.

After the shooting, good sense
might come to the descendants of the
survivors, but human nature dic-
tates that World War II will not
be the last war. Incredible as it may
sound, there may still be pacifists.
Fortunately, there will be other
Americans of more perceptive ilk.
We shall need brave men and wo-
men in that time of troubles, but we
have them now, and enough of them
will survive to ridicule those of us
who believe that we could moral-
ize away the harsh facts of the
world, who thought that what we
believe in was not worth fighting
for it nuclear bombs had to be
used; they will especially curse
those of us who dreamed sense-
lessly of a fairy peace when we
should have been rearming—and re-
affirming the indomitable spirit of
the American people.

As shown by last night’s action on the University dance

zen is as compared with the
American citizen.

This is a tricky question and in-
volves broad, impressionistic judg-
ments. It might be well to ask, how-
ever, whether either one is much
better off than the other as far as
protection against stereotyped and
propagandistic reporting about each
other is concerned.

The Russians have propaganda
films; we have little Orphan Annie
and Winnie Winkle, and the gro-
tesque distortions are not limited to
our comic strips. Perhaps the best
that can be said on this point is
that the citizen of the West can, if
he has enough interest and desire,
find objective reporting of reality
if he looks hard enough.

On the other hand, the tension
level in the free West, and especially
in the United States, seems much
higher than in the Soviet Union. In-
