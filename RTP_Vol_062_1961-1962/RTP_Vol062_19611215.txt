Dr. Hughes Says Communism
Will Not Replace Christianity

By SHANNON JUNG

Communism does not possess such
permanent stature as to be placed in
the same league as Christianity. The
Communist transient threat of win-|
ning men’s minds intellectually is|
no longer appealing—in fact, it
seems to be dying now.

These conclusions terminated a
lecture by Dr. Thomas Hughes of
the history department who spoke
to a student group Tuesday night,
as the second in a series of talks
sponsored by the UCA.

Entitled, “Communism vs. Chris-
tianity,” the lecture was followed
by an active period of discussion.

Stressing the inadequacy of the
spiritual offerings of Communism,
Hughes analyzed the misunderstand-
ings in the nature of the struggle
by Christian laymen.

One misconception Hughes pointed
out was that Communism is a threat
merely because it is God-less. Equal-
ly erroneous is the conception
that Communists are continuously
closing churches. “Their opposing
Christianity would be as politically
clumsy as a politican here coming
out against motherhood.”

No economic system is more meri- |
torious than any other in the sight)
of God. Thus, our most serious)
misconception asserting the con-|
demnation of a communist economic
system has no basis.

As a historian, Hughes suggests)
that the nature of the threat is its

 

and German. Yesterday was the 14th

engenderment of enthusiasm, being
highly idealistic. Karl Marx was the
embodiment of the self-sacrificing
life. These high ideals extend even
to Communist belief in an eventual
utopia. A worldly utopia and the
progressive and idealistic movements
towards one are serious threats.

Communism is an escape from
freedom. The security derived from
authritative command is often more
attractive than the freedom of de-
ciding whether or not to follow
Christian ideals.

One of the last serious threats
mentioned was the belief that eco-
nomic welfare will bring spiritual
improvement. This theory, conclu-
sively disproved after World War I,
is often blindly accepted.

While Communism §rationalizes,
Christianity stands firm on its tra-
ditional principles. Hughes said that
Christians had no right to justify
forsaking their families while, under
a similar pressure, communist self-
sacrifice rationalizes anything.

Hughes concluded that an exam-
ination of Communism and Christi-
anity is both helpful and hopeful.
It helps Christians define their po-
sition more accurately. It indicates
a future divine discontent and spir-
itual bankruptcy in the achievement
of Communist utopia.

The Communist is now seeking
spiritual fulfillment. Will the in-
adequate offerings of a transient sys-

Dr. Thomas
Says Christmas

Is Humble Time)

By STEVE SMITH

Dr. J. N. Thomas delivered a
Christmas message of humility to
4 capacity audience at last night’s
University Christmas Candlelight
Service.

Using as his text Paul’s letter to
the Philippians, Dr. Thomas con-
trasted the humility of Christ in
siving up his divine right, with the
inherent pride in men. The letter
was written by Paul in an effort to
heal a breach in the church at Phil-
ippi, apparently caused by pride.

“What better gift than a humility
pattern on His own” could we bring
Christ at Christmas, asked Dr.
Thomas?

Dr. Thomas said that when Christ

became man, he did not leave off be- |

ing God. Even though he remained
divine, his act was one of infinite
condescension. The Christ retained
divine power, love , truth, and holi-
ness when he became man; but he

gave up omnipotence, omnipresence, |

and omniscence. He became humbly

obedient to his Father, even to the,

death of the cross.

The power and majesty of God
is not incongruous with his humility;
humility is not weakness, but
strength. It can unseat the mortal
ego.

The interdenominational service,
first held in 1916, was held under
the auspices of the University Chris-
tian Association. Dr. David Sprunt,
W&L Chaplain, was the presiding
minister.

Four students read the traditional
Christmas scripture. The readers
were Ashley Wiltshire, John Dun-

nell, Roger Paine, and Mervin Clay.

 

 

tem be satisfactory? Is this the po-
tent ethical threat of Communism?

F, D. Costume
Sales Are Up

Sales of Fancy Dress costumes
totalled 321 last week, compared to
a total of 280 sold for the 1961 Fancy
Dress Ball.

Dance Board vice president Frank
Young credited the Dance Board
Advisory Council for stimulating the
added interest in this year’s Ball.
Young also feels that students were
attracted by the announcement that

the big dance will be held in the!

Commons this year.

The full dress costumes are re-
quired for the “High Society” theme
of the Ball. Girls will wear formal
dresses of their own choosing.

 

National Student Association Is
Active Despite Fire From Right

The largest student confederation
in the United States is the US.
National Student Association, which
claims to “speak for all American
students,” although it represents
only a fraction of that number.

Although Washington and Lee is
not a member of the National Stu-
dent Association, or NSA, junior
Craig Distlehorst attended the or-
ganization’s Fall Regional Assembly,
held December 1-2, in Greensboro,
N. C. Distlehorst, woh holds the
office of Executive Secretary of the
Young Republicans Clubs, acted as
an observer at the convention. He
has reported on his experience to
W&L student body president Uncas
McThenia and to the Ring-tum Phi.

The Carolinas-Virginia Regional
meeting of NSA was held at the
Woman’s college of the University of
North Carolina, in Greensboro. The |
topic of the convention was the|
University in Developing Areas, spe- |
cifically Asia, Africa, and  Latin|
America. |

Distlehorst had the choice of one}

 

cent of American colleges and uni-
versities, a number under 400, but
for over a decade has been repre-
sented at youth conferences all over
the world and before Congress in
Washington as the voice of Ameri-
can students. It is an organization |
of student governments rather than |
of local clubs.

Besides engaging in political is-|
sues, which is its main activity, the|
NSA promotes improvements in stu-
dent government. Its political stands |
are ultra-liberal: the NSA platform |
includes endorsement of the student |
riots which turned Eisenhower away
from Japan; favor of Castro’s
spreading of Culture in Cuba, and
condemnation of the U.S. part in
invading the island; recognition of |
Red China; and promotion of the)
Peace Corps. Such plans of the NSA |
platform are established at an annual |
summer convention at which plat- |
forms are adopted.
Group Under Hot Fire |

The NSA summer Congress of 1961 |

are billed as those of the NSA, just
as those passed in general assembly.
At the 1960 national convention, the
delegates passed 13 resolutions while
the Executive Committee passed 84.

Moreover, opponents have pointed
out, the committee of 30 which is
entitled the voice of “all American
students” is not itself representative.
Its regional structure is set so that
New England, which has 10 times
as many members as does the Utah
region, has only twice as many EC
votes as does Utah.

The method of electing campus
delegates to NSA conventions is an-
other point under attack. The NSA
constitution does not require that
representatives be elected—they may
be appointed by the student govern-
ment of the school they represent.

These argument are difficult to
counter.

Macon student body president will |

most of which was conducted as a|
round-table. The primary subject |
discussed was the development of |
education in Asian countries. Amer- |
ican foreign aid policy and similar |
topics were also raised during the |
two days.

Speakers to the convention in-|
cluded the Vice-President on Na-|
tional Affairs for the NSA, and a
representative of the Peace Corps.

The NSA represents only 20 per|

tion, there have been many attacks |

New Portrait of Mr. Mattingly

University

Given Portrait

Of Mattingly

An anonymous donor has given
an oil portrait of Earl S. Mattingly,
who has been university trasurer
since 1940, to Washington and Lee.

Prof. Rupert N. Latture, acting
for the donor, presented the paint-
ing to Washington and Lee Presi-
dent Fred C. Cole in a small cere-
mony in the President’s office
Tuesday. Mr. Mattingly was there
for the presentation.

The portrait was done by Mrs. H.
Donahoe, of St. Petersburg, Fla.,
from photographs of Mr. Mattingly.

Mr. Mattingly, who serves in the
dual capacity of secretary of the uni-
versity’s Board of Trustees and
treasurer, first came to Washington
and Lee in 1917 as a student. Af-
ter service with the U. S. Army in
World War I, he returned and re-
ceived his bachelor of arts degree
in geology in 1925. While a student
he served as university registrar,
and after graduation continued in
that capacity until his appointment
as treasurer. He was a student assist-
ant in the Treasurer’s Office in
1917.

A native of Washington, D.C., Mr.
Mattingly attended Randolph-Ma-
con Academy in Front Royal from

and through student activities out-
side the class.

“In class I try to make music a

ledge and understanding,” he says.

Phillips Asked
To Anaylze Bill

Senator John L. McClellan of
Arkansas, chairman of the Senate
Labor Investigations Committee, has
asked Dr. Charles Phillips, W&L
economics professor, to submit an
analysis of a proposed Senate bill
designed to place the nation’s trans-
portation unions under the anti-trust
laws.

The bill would amend the anti-
trust laws so as to prohibit certain
activities of transportation labor or-
ganizetions in restraint of trade.

 

‘Music Is An Experience
That Must Be Conveyed’

For the non-technical student,
Stewart offers an_ introductory
course in music designed to “en-
hance the students’ understanding
and enjoyment of music.” The more
advanced student may take theory
and composition of music in which
practical exercises and original com-
positions are required. This is an-
other way of making music “come
alive.”

Outside the classroom, “I try to
create musical experience though
participation, to create a program
which will serve as a means of ex-
pression for the students,” Stewart
said.

In creating this program of ex-
pression, Stewart assists and directs
a number of extra-curricular activi-
ties, among them are: the Glee Club,
the Capperales, the John A. Graham
Brass Choir and the Chamber Music
Class.

Born in Buffalo, N. Y., Stewart
attended the American Conservatory
of Music in Chicago where he took
master’s degrees in music education,
violin and composition. With the ex-
ception of a tour of duty in the

in the navy he did the music for
two radio shows, “On Target” and

 

Dr. Phillips believes that the bill
is inadequate, and that it would
create more problems than it would
solve.

“If you apply anti-trust laws to
labor unions, all unions should be
included, not just transportation.

“This is a point of fairness. Why
single out a single group?

“Senator McClellan hopes to ap-
ply anti-trust laws to the Teamsters
first, and then to the other unions
as the need arises. But there is a
danger of reducing the effectiveness
of the anti-trust laws by constant
amendment.

“This is the lesson we have learn-
ed with our tax structure. Constant
amendment can only result in con-
| fusion and ineffciency.

“And by dragging labor into the
present anti-trust system, we may
very well lose our ability to deal
with management.”

Dr. Phillips feels that McClellan’s
bill does not attack the heart of the
problem.

“The only solution to the current
labor problem is to reduce the size
of the bargaining units. Industry-
wide bargaining is a hinderance to
competitive enterprize, because there
is always the danger of an industry-
wide strike. We must this
problem first.”

The bill seems to have virtually no
chance of Senate approval in the
forthcoming session.

“The Teamsters themselves,” says
Dr. Phillips, “are strong enough to
check the bill. And the AFL-CIO,
although currently at odds with the
Teamsters, would certainly join
| them in this case.”

Besides his work on campus, Pro-

music by participating in numerous
musical organizations in Virginia and
the East. He is concert master with
the Roanoke Symphony and associ-
ate composer for the American Mu-
sic Center. He also serves as treasur-

sic Association and on the board of
trustees of the Bennington Com-
posers Conference
Music Players, Inc.

In addition to his directorial and
performing work, Stewart is
a composer of some note. Tomorrow
evening three of his compositions for
woodwind instruments are to be
performed at Columbia University
in New York City. At the next per-
formance of the Roanoke Symphony
on February 12, his Prelude for
Strings will be given. The Birm-
ingham Festival of Arts in February
will present his Five Visions for a
woodwind quintet. The Three Pieces
for a Woodwind Quintet will be per-
formed for the first time in New this
April on the Music in Our Time
series.

Professor Stewart is a strong be-
liever in modern music. Though he
realizes that it is not yet popular

years. “It has had a hard climb,”

Guerrilla War

Is Discussed

By STEVE SMITH

Dr. Milton Colvin of Washington
and Lee’s Political Science Depart-
ment presented some of the startling
possibilities of unconventional war-
fare to the ROTC students Wednes-
day night.

Colvin, a World War II combatant
in unconventional action, and until
1958 commander of a reserve para-
chutist unit, spoke in Lee Chapel to
freshmen and sophomore ROTC
members.

An atomic bomb detonated in the
ocean could create a tidal wave
which would wash Washington and
New York off the map and reach
inland 200 miles, Colvin said. By
solar energy, it could be possible also
to bring back the ice age in a given
area. Colvin went on to list the in-
cidents described in the book Ugly
American as unconventional war-
fare also. These are opposite ex-
tremes in the methods of activities
which Colvin treated principally
as guerrilla warfare.

Colvin said that the United States
is now involved in unconventional
warfare. “Perhaps it may head off
total war.” Propaganda and psycho-
logical devices were classed as un-
conventional war. A man could to-
day carry in his suitcase a bomb
which could wipe out New York
City. Colvin also presented the idea
of selective assassination, by which
| a power could rid itself of leaders
| vital to its enemies.

In unconventional warfare, Colvin
said, “Your job is to survive.” In

hard-won nickles in.

A cold-quiz file for the NFU’s, oops, Independents.

An Executive Committee of their own for Protest.

A complete set of Hot Nuts recordings for the Anderson
Music Room.

An autographed picture of William Buckley for the Con-
servative Society.

A complete Telescreen installation for the Assimilation
Committee, a la 1984.

Some customers for the Arthur Murray Dance Studio on
Washington Street.

A year’s subscription to the New York Daily News for the
Tuesday Staff.

A horsewhip for the Control Committee.

Lavatory facilities for the Hollins Inn.

The Facts At Randolph-Macon

From an editorial (reprinted below on this page )in the
Randolph-Macon’s College newspaper commenting on a recent
National Student Association conference:

“Getting the facts is a difficult and laborious task... For
instance, in Latin America, the difference between Marxist
and a Communist is held as basic to an understanding of the
present situation in Cuba. To the members of this Conference
from South America, a Marxist-Leninist was vastly different
from a member of the Red Communist party.”

Just what in the hell is the vast difference between a
Marxist-Leninist and a Communist?

Yes, getting the facts is definitely a difficult and laborious
task.

NSA, anyone?

 

‘Knowledge Is Power’

From the Sun Dial, Randolph-Macon Woman’s College:

Getting the facts is a difficult and laborious task. It involves details,
and these are at times elusive. However, they are attainable. The NSA
conference brought out little known aspects of the actual conditions in
Algeria. The Algerians must go outside the country for education—this
involves money. The American press, because of its allegiance to France
must necessarily withhold some of this information. These facts were given
by Rachid Benouameus, President of the U. S. Branch of the National
Union of Students of Algeria.

Another fact introduced at this conference was a concept of academic
freedom unknown to U. S. Students. In Rhodesia political freedom for the
black is almost nil. In Ghana, the student follows a British-styled program
that does not meet the demands of his society. There appears to be a
complete lack of student choice within the University. As a contrast the
students in Panama elect their own Deans and, as in most Latin American
countries, they have political asylum within the boundaries of the school.
In Asia, the students are main political forces and have the inflence to
keep an American president from visiting.

Obscure facts sometimes provide an insight into the general reaction
of these new nations. For instance, in Latin America, the difference be-
tween a Marxist and a Communist is held as basic to an understanding
of the present situation in Cuba. To the members of this Conference from
South America, a Marxist-Lenist was vastly different from a member of
the Red communist party. A Marixst was another form of the Fabian
society which was the socialistic society in England formed in the latter
part of the 19th Century.

The natural reaction of America to Castro’s announcement as a Marxist
was that here is a Communist at our door. But to a member of the Latin
American communities, the reaction is not the same. For a Marxist is
common in Latin America, and is not the evil subject of USSR. Nor does
this mean that they are Communist dupes, for apparently some of the
most liberal leaders are avowed Trotskyites, followers of the Stalin-deposed
campaigner for immediate world revolution to the Communist camp.

The world is full of facts and again, it takes hard work to discern
the truth from the maze of prejudices and obscurities. This means that
Americans must begin to rework their ideas of world politics. No longer
ean we consider that the foreigners are always wrong. Nor can we relax.
If we do wish to remain intelligent individuals, we have to obtain ade-
quate facts. This might involve some effort on our part in various ways,
but it would be better to know the reasons for our neighbor’s troubles than
be guilty of being “dupes” of ignorance ourselves.

Protest-R-T P
Duel Builds
Mental Muscles

By HOWARD SLATER

If we as students continue to
look with contemptuous disfavor at
the feud between the Ring-tum Phi
and Protest, then we will being do-
ing ourselves an extreme disservice.
Once again we have the oppor-
tunity to choose between form and
substance. Once again we are drift-
ing toward the unsubstantial.

In common everyday language,
what that means is: What’s so crazy
about criticism? Does “Jenkinson’s
Law,” which says that “everybody’s
crazy”—does that just obliterate the
good that down-to-earth construc-
tive criticism can perform?

More Than Name Calling

I think not. The situation really
amounts to more than just name
calling. There was a lot of truth in
the charges of both newspapers—
and I am quite willing to use that
term advisedly. Hasn’t it been a
common gripe around this campus
that the Ring-tum Phi doesn’t pro-
vide what it ought to provide? Yet
when Protest—“the young upstart
that it is’—comes out and prints
what’s on everybody’s minds for
years, then Protest is condemned
for underscoring “its own apparent
shaky mental attitudes.” Shaky men-
tal attitudes my eye! If saying that
the Ring-tum Phi could do better
makes one mentally shaky, then
Jenkinson’s Law is perfectly appli-
cable. We are all crazy!

Turning the coin over, we ought
to realize that the Ring-tum Phi had
some good points to make. “Guerrila
tactics” and inflammatory prose are a
little more suited, at times, to the
hinterlands of Guantanomo Bay than
to the student body which Protest
ostensibly hopes to appeal to. The
inconsistency of Protest leaves the
sneaking suspicion that there’s more
than one cook messing with that
broth. Sometimes, somebody drops in
the wrong recipe.

PROTEST Stimulates

But Bob Ketcham, and most of us
it would seem, don’t really appre-
ciate that by and large Protest real-
ly is “the positive force that it
purports to be.” This is because
Protest has been the most effective
stimulant of mental activity on our
campus. Needless to say, there was—
and perhaps still is—a dearth of that
kind of activity. Bob Ketcham, be-
ing far from an anti-cerebral offend-
er, surprises me when he makes this
mistake.

By the same token, we are told to
dismiss as an undesirable develop-
ment the great strides which the
Ring-tum Phi has taken in the past
two years down from its Ivory
Tower. With the advent of Protest
this contact with the student body
became accelerated, for now there
was something to think about, talk
about and write about, instead of the
endless dirge about Apathy.

Is the Ring-tum Phi to throw
away this perfectly wonderful op-
portunity to be constructive, to
contribute significantly to a newly-
won concern for ideas and things
which many of us welcome on this
campus? Is the Ring-tum Phi to re-
turn to its Ivory Tower as “the offi-
cial Campus Voice?” (Official Cam-
pus Voice indeed! Why not Pravda?
That would really fit if we wanted
to be official.)

Peace, Gentlemen

In short, the Ring-tum Phi and
Protest ought not to quarrel. It’s not
nice! They have “lessened their
stature.” Lessened their stature? By
telling the truth, or a good deal of
it about one another? Nonsense! The
demand, mirrored in Bob Ketcham’s
letter, was for both publications to
ignore one another.

But you tell me how on earth one
of those papers could possibly ignore
the existence of the other? It can’t
be done. If the attempt were made,
now then we'd really see something
undignified.

Which brings us back to the origi-
nal reference about form and sub-
stance. We are mistaking the
awkardness with which these two
semi-journalistic antagonists blast
one another as the substance of the
blows. On the contrary, although
the blows may not look good, they
are landing with telling effect. That
is, they would land with effect if
we would forget about the awkward,
undiginified form, and concentrate
on the truth of the blows.

It is this truth which counts, not
How you say something but What
you say. Dignified inaction is for the
birds, or for the know-nothings—
which is what most of us were quite
recently. I say let those two giants
of the press slug it out. Every direct
hit is therapeutic—for them and for
us all. Our papers can become our
volitional Vic Tanney’s. We're just
a step away from developing bigger
and better mental muscles.

 

 

An Interview With Dr. Fishwick

 

The Population Explosion

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The holocaust of war, the travesty
of political imperialism, and the hor-
ror of untenable disease are fast
fading as the major world problems.

Taking their place as the biggest
threat to mankind is mankind itself.

As the population continues to
grow larger and larger at ever-
increasing rates, social scientists as
well as statesmen and _ theologians
are becoming more and more con-
cerned with the dilemma of too
many people.

According to Washington and Lee
Professor of American Studies Dr.
Marshall Fishwick, there is a “hor-
rible inevitablity” about the popula-
tion explosion.

“It’s a problem that can’t really
be solved by government,” Dr. Fish-
wick said. “There doesn’t seem to
be any way to avoid it.”

He said the problem was made "

even greater because we are not only
fighting ignorance but the sancity of
the family.

The Catholic

Dr. Fishwick cited the Roman
Catholic Church, “the main line of
Christianity,” as a major factor in
the problem because of its negative
stand on birth control.

“The United States is placed in a
particularly delicate position be-
cause we have a Roman Catholic
president,” he said.

Just what is the scope of the
dilemma?

Discussing the rate of population
increase, Dr. Fishwick quoted the
following statistics: “In 1650, Eu-
rope had 100 million people. In 1950,
she had 540 million. The United
States in 1650 had one million, and
160 million in 1950.

“And, most frightening of all—
Asia had 330 million people in 1650,
and in 1950 she had 937 million, al-
most tripling her population in 300

years.”
And the rates are increasing
constantly.

Medicine’s Role

Dr .Fishwick also talked about the
role of modern medicine in bringing
the problem about.

“Naturally by conquering disease
and increasing life spans, we in-
crease the population. When we (the
U.S.) move into a backward area,
we actually accentuate the prob-
lem by bringing them modern medi-
cine.

“If the people of India or China
lived as long as the people of the
United States, the increase in Asia’s
population would be overwhelming.”

He said that “those areas which
can least afford it are the ones hav-
ing the real explosion.”

   

Dr. Fishwick

“Patience and intelligent concern”

According to Dr. Fishwick, “nearly
two-thirds of the population live in
underdeveloped countries and terri-
tories.”

He said, “Approximately two-
thirds of the population is Negro,”
and he added that “this is the real
core of the problem.”

“And the rate of increase in the
Negro race is tremendously higher
than that of the Caucasian race.”

 

About one-half of the people of
the world, according to Dr. Fishwick,
make less than $100 a year actual
income.

Some areas, in desparation, have
begun to alleviate the problem. Ja-
pan, for instance, now has legalized
abortions.

The Prospects

The prospects for the future of
the world—if this problem is not
soon solved—are not encouraging.

Dr. Fishwick quoted Gunnar
Myrdal’s theory on the outcome:
“The rich countries will get richer
and the poor ones will get poorer.
All forms of democratic systems and
free inquiry will disappear.

“Misery and despair,” he said,
“will prevail. And there is no
quicker way to have a communist
world than for the world’s people
to be despairing and miserable.”

Is there a solution? If so, what?

“In the past century, the Western
world tended to flourish on what one
critic called the three p’s—piracy,
patronage and paternalism.

“This day has passed—the only
way out is to show patience and
intelligent concern for the rest of
the world. Nowhere is this more
evident than in the problem of the
population explosion.”

New Viewpoints Needed

Continuing, Dr. Fishwick pointed
out that we “have to use our new
scientific knowledge, not only to
mold biology as we must and are
doing, but to mold our moral and
religious viewpoints.

“We have to get into the realms
of the spirit,” he said. “If we are
ever to survive, a new response is
demanded.”

Is there, really, anything being
done at the present time?

Again Dr. Fishwick did not seem
optimistic.

“Very little is being done to re-
leive the problem now. We are para-
lyzed by a number of factors.”

 

Behind The News

W&L’s candidate for a Rhodes
Scholarship, Rosie Page, failed to
qualify in the Virginia state elimi-
nations. Had he qualified he would
have faced another series of inter-
views in regional eliminations at
Atlanta, Ga.

Virginia’s finalists are Edward Or-
ser, of Bon Air, from Randolph-
Macon, and John Kirby, Jr., of
McLean, from the University of
Virginia law school.

PROTEST has recently attacked
the Friday Edition for not publishing
the EC minutes. Steve Suttle, how-
ever, brings the minutes to the print
shop every week. Unfortunately, the
minutes of the weekly meetings
seldom contain anything of interest
to anyone but EC members.

The minutes consist primarily of
minute administrative details, and
are generally not considered news-
worthy by the Friday staff.

Caught in a history lecture: “In
the Twenties, there was a great ten-
dency for young American authors
to go to Paris and live on the Left
Bank of the Rhine.”

And again: “In the Thirties, there
emerged a new literary style known

as stream-of-consciousness. The
leader of this style was Joyce
Kilmer.”

 

 

To the Editor:

I wish to add my commendations
to the others which I am sure the
Board of Trustees have received as
a result of their action on the invi-
tation to Martin Luther King.

There is just about as much point
in inviting King to speak on “relat-
ing Christianity to major current is-
sues” as there would be in inviting
entrepreneurs of “the hill” (assum-
ing “the hill” carries with it the same
connotation it did 25 years ago) to
speak on marriage problems or to
address a Sociology Seminar. Both
are law violators of a sort; both defy
convention; to those who consider
themselves benefited by the viola-
tions, both are regarded as serving
a useful purpose. While King may

 

be considered a leader in his field,
you shouldn’t sell “the hill” short.
I don’t know what got into the
faculty, for certainly the faculty of
25 years ago would have handled
the latter invitation.

If you really want to kick up a
stink, why don’t a bunch of you
get together and invite colored girls
to Fancy Dress this year? This would
pretty well ruin it for the rest of
your school mates and their dates,
and it would damn sure finish it off
as the outstanding college social
event of the South.

I-M Basketball Action—Sigma Nu’s vs. SPE’s.

I-M Basketball
Wins Posted By |
Beta’s, Nu’s

Intramural basketball entered its
seventh week with Sigma Nu and
the Betas undefeated in their re-
spective leagues. Sigma Nu has top-
ped Pi Phi and SPE, while the lead-
ers in Division A have victories over
Phi Ep and PiKA.

Led by the scoring of Fred Nel-
son, Sigma Nu easily downed the
cagers from SPE 44-19. Nelson had
twelve points, while nine of his
teammates also contributed baskets.

In the Beta-PiKA contest, the
game was close until the final min-
utes of play when the Betas scored
five straight points to assure vic-
tory. With Ray Gordon hitting for
17 points, the Betas received their
second win by 40-33.

In other games, Phi Delt downed
ZBT 30-28, Phi Kap defeated SPE
35-26, and SAE overran DU 41-34.

Phi Kap remained unbeaten in
I-M bowling by easily downing
Kappa Sig 3-0 last week. Freshman
Jim Bassart and John Kiely led
their teammates to the third straight
victory. Bussart had a 555 total,
while Kieley’s was 513. The com-
bined score for Phi Kap was 2406,
compared to Kappa Sig’s 2107.

On the same evening the Betas
met the bowlers from SPE and easily
won the contest 4-0. Leading the
victors were Mendell and Hender-
son.

Still leading the league in indi-
vidual averages is freshman Vic
Galef. Galef has a 203 average,
with his high game totaling 236.

Wrestlers Ready For

Washington and Lee’s wrestling
team will carry some top individual
records to Chattanooga this week-
end for the first Southern Invita-
tional Wrestling Tournament .

Sporting such top performers as
co-captain Sandy Mersereau and
Dave Montgomery, Coach Richard
Miller says the Generals have “a
pretty good individual won and lost
record for any team to take to any
tournament.” Mersereau, a _ 157
pounder, has compiled a 22-7-1 rec-
ord in a little over three seasons,
and Montgomery, a junior who
weighs 130, has a 17-5 record.

Although the tournament will not
affect team standings, the individual
records will be altered by the re-
sults of the matches. The Generals
will be meeting wrestlers from Au-
burn, Georgia, Chattanooga, Emory,
Alabama, Florida State, Sewanee
and Applachian.

Staunton Hands
Baby Generals

First ’61 Loss

A lackluster second half perform-
ance by Washington and Lee’s fresh-
man basketball team handed Staun-
ton Military Academy a 69-43 vic-
tory yesterday. It was the Baby
Generals’ first 1961 defeat.

Trailing by five points at half-
time, 37-32, W&L scored only one
point during the first eight minutes
of the second half, giving SMA
plenty of opportunity to run up a big
lead.

While Staunton’s guards were
opening up the Baby General de-
fense for easy lay-ups, everything
that Washington and Lee threw up
at the basket failed to go in.

High-scoring Dick Livingston
scored only four points, and Jerry
Kowalski could manage only five.

George Madison was high for the
losers with 10.

Brill Craig had 18, and Jerry Fish-
er 15 for SMA.

First Half

Staunton jumped into an early
lead at the beginning of the game,
but the Generals came back to tie
the score with five minutes left in
the first half.

An aggressive W&L defense forced
SMA into numerous offense mis-
takes, resulting in a series of easy
lay-ups for the Generals, many of
which were missed.

Madison and _ Livingston,

from the floor, couldn’t find the
range, and guard Scotty Varner’s
shooting was the only thing that kept

Cagers Against F-M
In Doremus Tonight

Washington and Lee’s varsity basketball team gets one
more pre-Christmas chance to get back in the winning column
when it meets Franklin and Marshall here tonight in Doremus
Gymnasium. Game time is 8:00.

Franklin and Marshall comes into the game with a 2-2 rec-
ord, with wins over Swathmomre and Ursinus. In both wins, the

Diplomats’s fast-breaking offense has*¥

rolled up over 80 points.

Washington and Lee is 1-3 for the
year.

Defense

Head Coach Bob McHenry said
he'll send his Generals into a 3-2
double team defense in order to
hold down the high scoring Dips.

It was this defense that sparked
the Generals to their best effort of
the season against powerful Catho-
lic University last Friday.

Even thought Catholic pulled out
a last-ditch one-point win, W&L
held the visitors to a season’s low
on offense, 55 points.

Offense
The Washington and Lee defense
will have to be at its best tonight
to hold down the taller and more

experienced Diplomats.
Franklin and Marshall operates
from a 3-2 offense, using two 6’5”
sophomores, John Farrell and Roy

 

 

Forbescue, under the basket.
High scorers for the Dips are
guards Bob Leslie and Phil Hallen.

“They love to fast-break,” said
McHenry. “We'll have to be up all
the way to contain them.”

Generals

McHenry will open with a slightly
adjusted lineup tonight, with fresh-
man Louie Paterno moving into a
starting role in the backcourt.

Paterno, who sat out almost all of
W&L’s first two games, is already
the Generals second high scorer for

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Phi Psi Trips
KS Grapplers

(Continued from page 3)
Phi Kap’s Bussart is second in this
department.

In one of the most exciting wrest-
ling contests of the year, Phi Psi
edged out Kappa Sig 21-15, with the
last individual match deciding the
score. With the score reading 18-
15, Phi Psi’s Jimmy Russ met Jim
Sylvester in the unlimited division.
Russ emerged the victor as he de-
feated his counterpart on points,
14-10.

Also in wrestling the grapplers
from KA had an easy evening
against the Betas as they won 30-5.
The Betas received their five points
when KA forfeited in the 147 Ib.
class. On the same day Sigma Nu
topped Lambda Chi 30-10.

The handball schedule has been
marred with many forfeits. The most
recent have been SAE’s to Sigma
Chi and the failure of the NFU
to show against Phi Delt.

In other contests PiKA shutout
Kappa Sigma 5-0, while the repre-
sentatives from ZBT were losing
to KA by the same score.

the last four years, they have won
20 and lost 11 matches.

The Chattanooga tournament will
give the Generals a chance to meet
colleges not on their dual-meet
schedule.

“This tournament is a good idea,”
Miller said. “We've needed one in
this area for a long time.” Miller’s
teams have a 40-42-3 record in his
eight years as wrestling coach at
W&L.

four games, including 13 clutch
points against Catholic last week.

Rodger Fauber is currently lead-
ing the scoring race, with a 14.0
average for four games.

Joining Fauber and Paterno in the
starting lineup will be Bill Ide, Bill
Smith, and either Tom or Jon Supac.

Need the Win

McHenry called the Franklin and
Marshall game one of the year’s
most important games from a morale
standpoint.

“We need to get this second win
before we go home,” he said. “We
don’t know exactly what to expect
from Franklin and Marshall, but
we know they'll be up for us.”

McHenry plans to emphasize re-
bounding and shooting against the
taller Dips.

“We need to hit 50 per cent from
the floor to win,” he said.

the Germans during the Second
World War. During the period 1941-
1943 the Germans lost 300,000 killed,
including 30 generals, and thousands
of pieces of rolling stock. In the
first half of 1944 the Nazi forces lost
1200 locomotives to the partisans,
Colvin stated.

The island-hopping amphibian
in the Pacific during the Warld War
were also cited as unconventional
warfare, revealing the scope to which
it can grow. But unconventional
warfare is still normally defined as
guerrilla operations involving only
a limited number of men.
this type of fighting, the mind is
the most powerful weapon, mental
agility being the most valuable asset.

The most important factors which
the guerrilla fighter must overcome

“There is nothing new about un-

He cited the trick of the Trojan

Francis Marion, and the late William

Staunton quit making errors on
offense, and the Generals couldn't
do anything right.

After eight minutes of the half,
Coach Joe Lyles benched the entire
first team in apparent disgust, and

SALUTE: STEVE BANKS

Because of Steve Banks, who just two years ago was an
undergraduate engineering student, the Bell Telephone
System is closer to wiping out the noise (or “static”) that
sometimes interferes with telephone conversations.

On one of his first assignments, Steve examined the
noise levels that had “leaked” into telephone circuits in

Colorado. His findings shed new light on the source of
noise, and on the important methods of measuring it.

‘|e ame Menlbav os Your ator

America is a great country. America’s cities are full of houses.
America’s forests are full of trees. America’s rivers are full of
water. But it is not houses and trees and water that make
America great; it is curiosity—the constant quest to find
answers —the endless, restless “Why?” “Why?” “Why?”

Therefore, when I was told that Marlboro was a top seller
at colleges from USC to Yale, I was not content merely to
accept this gratifying fact, I had to find out why.

I hied myself to campuses in every sector of this mighty land.
Virst, I went to the Ivy League—dressed, of course, in an
appropriate costume: a skull-and-bones in one hand, a triangle
in the other, a mask-and-wig on my head, a hasty pudding in
my chops. “Sir,” I cried, seizing an Ivy Leaguer by the lapels,
which is no mean task considering the narrowness of Ivy League
lapels, Lut, I, fortunately, happen to have little tiny hands; in
fect, I spent the last war working in a small arms plant where, I
em} roud to say, I was awarded a Navy “E” for excellence and
v on many friends—‘‘Sir,” I eried, seizing an Ivy Leaguer by the
lapels, “how come Marlboro is your favorite filter cigarette?”

   

“Tm glad you asked that question, Shorty,’ he replied.
“Mar'Loro is my favorite filter cigarette because it is the filter
cirarette with the unfiltered taste.”

“Oh, thank you, sir!” I eried and ran posthaste to several
campuses in the Big Ten, wearing, of course, the appropriate
costurre: a plaid Mackinaw, birling boots, a Kodiak bear and
frost-hitten ears.

*pying an apple-cheeked young coed, I tugged my forelock
and said, “Excuse me, miss, but how come Marlboro is your
favorite filter cigarette?”

“I’m glad you asked that question, Shorty,’’ she replied.
“Marlboro is my favorite filter cigarette because the flavor is
flavorful, the flip-top box flips and the soft-pack is soft.”

“Oh, thank you, apple-cheeked young coed,” I cried and
bobbed a ecurtsey and sped as fast as my little fat legs would
carry me to several campuses in the Southwest, wearing, of
course, the appropriate costume: chaps, canteen, and several oil
leases. Spying a group of undergraduates singing “Strawberry
Roan,” I removed my hat and said, “Excuse me, friends, but
wihv is Marlboro your favorite filter cigarette?”

“We are glad you asked that question, Shorty,” they replied.
“Marlboro is our favorite filter cigarette because we, native sons
and daughters of the wide open spaces, want a cigarette that is
frank and forthright and honest. We want, in short, Marlboro.”’

“Oh, thank you, all,” I cried and, donning a muu muu, I set
sil for Hawaii, because in Hawaii, as in every state where Old
Glory flies, Marlboro is the leading seller in flip-top box. On
campus, off campus, in all fifty states, wherever people smoke for
pleasure in this great land of ours, you will find Marlboro.

Marlboro—the king-size, unfiltered Philip Morris

mildness. Have a Commander. Welcome aboard.
