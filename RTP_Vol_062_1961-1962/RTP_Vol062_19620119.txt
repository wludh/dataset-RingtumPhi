Law Group
Selects Stow
As Preident

In an election held last
week, Charles Stow was named
president of the Student Bar
Association for the second
semester. Other officers elected
were John Petzold, vice pres-
ident; Richard Radis, secre-
tary; and Larry Lambert,
treasurer.

In a similar election, Stow’s wife,
Mrs. Jacqueline Stow was named
president of the Law Wives’ Asso-
ciation. Mrs. Charles Broll was
named vice president; Mrs. Peter
Dauk, secretary; and Mrs. Richard
Cantebury, treasurer.

Stow, a law student from Phoenix-
ville, Pennsylvania, will head the
Association until his graduation in
June. Stow and the other officers
will be installed at the Associa-
tion’s next meeting. He will replace
out-gowing president, Robert Frank.

Stow commented on the Associa-
tion that it “is an organization that
is growing, and it is my ambition
to have it reach its highest peak
this semester in student participa-

- ton.”

Membership Is Voluntary

The Student Bar Association dif-
fers from a regular student body
in that membership is voluntary,
but according to Stow, “We have
almost 100 per cent membership.”

The W&L Student Bar Associa-
tion is in the Fourth District along
with such schools as Duke, William
and Mary, and North Carolina. This
district is, in turn, a member of the
national association.

The main purposes of the Asso-
ciation are to run the affairs of the
law school student body and to co-
ordinate the student body and law
faculty.

A big project of the group each
year is a mock trial held in March.
Dr. C. V. Laughlin acts as judge
each year.

SBA An Active Group

Other projects of the Association
are presenting honors and awards
for excellence in various aspects of
law, sponsoring films, placing stu-
dents in business and law firms, and
sponsoring social activities for the
law school. The two main social
activities are the Christmas Dance
and the Spring Dance.

The group also sponsors a publi-
cation, the Washington and Lee
Lawyer, which it sends to alumni
and law firms.

Stow’s wife will officially become
president of the Law Wives Associa-
tion at the beginning of next semes-
ter. This association is composed
of the wives of law students, and its
purpose is to carry out various pro-
jects in behalf of the law school.

The Association’s main project for
this year is a benefit bridge party
to be held early in March. The
party is open to all bridge players,
and there will be prizes donated by
Lexington merchants. Many of the
prizes will be aimed at attracting
student participation. The purpose
of the project is to raise funds for
a law school scholarship.

Other projects of the wives in-
clude preparing sandwiches for law
students during exams, preparing
Christmas baskets for needy fami-
lies, and serving refreshments at law
school lectures.

 

Dr. Coulling Recovering
From Serious Operation

Dr. Sidney M. B. Coulling, assist-
ant professor in the Washington
and Lee English department, under-
went a successful major operation
January 8 and has been improving
steadily since then. A victim of a
serious inflamation of the lower
intestine, Coulling will probably not
return to his classes until next fall.

The operation was performed at
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Since
Coulling had to stop teaching, his
classes have been divided among
other members of the department.
Department head Dr. A. Ross Bor-
den said that other profesors will
continue to share the work.

Coulling is a member of Wash-
ton and Lee’s class of 1946, and
graduated magna cume laude and
Phi Beta Kappa. He received his
doctorate from the University of
North Carolina.

Fancy Dress Performers

Commended

By LARRY MEEKS

The Dave Brubeck Quartet, who
will play a concert here Fancy
Dress, was named top instrumental
group in the February issue of
Playboy magazine. Each member of
the group placed individually with
Brubeck himself taking first place
among the pianists. Paul Desmond
placed second in the alto sax cate-
gory, Joe Morello placed third
among drummers, and Gene Wright
placed tenth among bases.

Duke Ellington, who will be play-
ing for the Fancy Dress Ball, was
named top band leader in the poll
taken of the 1961 winners. He re-
ceived second place honors in the
readers’ poll.

Si Zenter, signed for the Saturday
dance, also placed among band
leaders, an unusual feat for a band
organized for less than a year.

 

Jenks Preparing

Book In Vienna

By SHANNON JUNG

Washington and Lee’s Dr. William
A. Jenks, who received a research
grant for study abroad, is presently
working in Vienna, compiling a
study of Austro-Hungarian political
and economic developments in the
late nineteenth century.

Jenks will return in September.
He left in mid-summer to begin the
work. The book which will result
from his work is a scholarly one, to
be read by professors and lecturers
who must present the material to
others.

Members of the W&L faculty have
traditionally received research aid
of this type, aimed at better inter-
pretation and more recent material
for classroom lectures. Dr. Jenks’
grant, a Social Science Research
Grant, is sponsored by the Social
Science Research Foundation. Com-
petition for the grants is very keen
among many scholars of established
reputation. The Research Founda-
tion, a private organization, pro-
vides living and travel costs for a
year of research.

This is not the first grant which
Dr. Jenks, a member of the facul-
ty since 1946, has won. In 1960,
Vienna and the Young Hitler traced
Viennese influence in shaping Hit-
ler’s character. Dr. Jenks’ doctoral
dissertation at Columbia, Austrian
Electorial Reform of 1907, written
on the introduction of universal
suffrage to Austria in 1907, was pub-
lished in 1950,

 

These awards are made annually
by Playboy in their Playboy All-

Stars poll, in which thousands of
votes are tabulated.

Cocktail Party Opens

This year’s Fancy Dress Weekend
will be kicked-off with a cocktail
party in honor of Fancy Dress presi-
dent Bill Ide. The party, to be
given by Kappa Alpha, will be held
at the Moose Lodge on February 2
from 4 to 6 p.m. The event will fea-
ture the TNT Tribble Combo with
Phil Flowers, vocalist. Arrangements
were made by FD vice president
Robin Norfleet.

Friday evening at 9 p.m. in the
Commons, Duke Ellington and his
Orchestra will provide music for
dancing. He will play until 1 a.m.

All students wishing to see the
figure must be in the Commons by
9 p.m. as the doors will be locked
during the figure. Fifteen hundred
persons are expected for this event
including students, faculty and ad-
ministration, interested citizens of
Lexington and surrounding com-
munities, and the press.

Jerry Hyatt, FD vice president
in charge of the figure, announced
that the figure will be presented
similiar to a presentation at an In-
augural Ball emphasizing _ this
year’s theme, “High Society.”

On Saturday afternoon Doremus
Gym will play host to the Dave
Brubeck Quartet from 3 to 5. The
concert promises to be one of the
highlights of the weekend. Dress for
the concert is conventional.

Saturday night Doremus Gym will
again be the center of activity on the
campus as Si Zenter provides dance
music. This performance marks the
first professional appearance of Si
Zenter and his group in the South.

Special Price for Visitors

Students coming from _ other
schools have one week in which to
purchase their tickets if they wish
to get them at reduced rates. Before
January 26, tickets to the concert are
$5, and tickets to the concert and
both dances are $10. After January
26, the price will be $7.50 for the
concert and $5 for each of the
dances.

Tickets may be secured by mail
by writing Dance Board, Box 458,
Lexington, Virginia.

“T hope that student participation
in the Fancy Dress activities—es-
pecially Saturday’s—will be good as
future Dance Board and faculty
decisions will be influenced by it,”
was Dance Board president Steve
Galef’s comment on the activities.

 

the awards will be given to those
interested in college teaching as a
career.

These prestigious fellowships are
normally three-year awards, pro-
viding a stipend of $2,000 for the
first year and higher amounts for
the second and third years.

A list of the graduate schools par-
ticipating in this program has just
been released. A copy may be ex-
amined in Dean Pusey’s Office.

The fellowships are available in
the humanities, social sciences, biol-
ogical sciences, physical sciences,
mathematics and engineering.

 

 

Leyburn Scheduled
To Publish History
Of Scotch - Irish

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. James G. Leyburn of Wash-
ington and Lee will culminate five
years of work with the publication
next spring of a new book entitled
The Scotch-Irish: A Social History.

Dr. Leyburn, head of the W&L so-
ciology department, has worked on
the 400-page book in Scotland and
Ireland as well as in the United
States. His work will be published
by the University of North Caro-
lina Press.

The fact that the Scotch-Irish
make up the largest ancestral seg-
ment of the U.S. population, next
to the English, is more than ade-
quate justification of Dr. Leyburn’s
treatment of the topic. He divides
the book into 3 sections:

First is the story of the typical
Scot in the lowlands before 1600,
showing his economic, religious, and
political situation. The book shifts
to its second section in dealing with
large numbers of Scotts who moved
to Northern Ireland after 1600.
Finally, the book tells the story of
the 200,000 Scotch-Irish who mi-
grated to America between 1718 and
1775. These immigrants, landing
mostly around Philadelphia, traveled
West through Pennsylvania and to
the Piedmont of the Carolinias.

The book shows the condition of
these immigrants as they moved
from Ireland to America. Their evo-
lution is the main concern of the
book, but it also deals with Amer-
ican politics, economics, and relig-
ion in relation to its subject.

Fishwick’s Books
Are Condemned

Alfred Percy, a Lynchburg histor-
ian and publisher, accused W&L
History Professor Marshall Fish-
wick of joining the “hand-biting
association” in his writings and lec-
tures on Virginia and General Lee.

Percy made his accusation before
the annual Lee-Jackson-Murray
birthday luncheon of the Old Do-
minion chapter of the United
Daughters of the confederacy on
Wednesday.

Percey’s speech, entitled “Lee—
the Emblem and Hope for Security,”
attacked Fishwick’s attitude in his
several books on Virginia.

In Percy’s words, “The writings
are used to undermine the position
of the South in general and Vir-
ginia in particular. It is sheer prop-
aganda. Lee was no failure. He was
an emblem for security and hope for
the South.”

“T feel there is no reason for a
‘Johnny come Lately’ to try to un-
dermine the character of so fine
a figure in history. Lee was not
chosen to head Washington and
Lee, then known as Washington Col-
as a figurehead, but because he in
those hard times, was a beacon of
hope, for security of the youth of
the battered South. He did not fail.”

Upon learning of Percy’s remarks,

“imaginative, sometimes bold plan-
ning” and his wisdom and foresight.

Cole was able to speak of many
improvements in the W&L program
in his report to the University.
These included the two new build-
ings which are under construction
and the IBM computer which has
been installed. He called the re-
quirements of College Entrance
Examination Board Achievement
Tests for all applicants another step
forward.

The addition of the Warner Schol-
arships for pre-medical students
was mentioned, as was the continued
growth of the Robert E. Lee Re-
search Program.

Regarding the recent shift in ad-
ministration, Cole cited the appoint-
ment of Dr. E. C. Atwood as Dean
of Students, and said Dean Atwood’s
service will permit Dean Gilliam to
devote his talents and energy to the
increasingly complex admission
problem.

Cole praised the formation of the
College Athletic Conference as an
indication of progress in another
field, saying he hoped its success
would help to restore a proper
perspective to some phases of in-
tercollegiate athletics. He also com-
plimented the football team and
the coaching staff for the honors
they have won.

“Many persons involved in higher
education,” said Cole, “are con-
cerned today over the increasing
difficulty which scientists and hu-
manists seem to have in communi-
eating with and understanding each
other.” While pushing for great im-
provement in the science program,
Washington and Lee will not force
an imbalance in favor of scientific
emphasis; scientists and humanists
must learn to live together.

Cole stated that W&L must teach
students to “understand better the
scientific world which none of us
can escape, yet understand it with
out sacrifice of ...ability to appre-
ciate non-scientific values.”

Western culture has seen the
“scientific revolution” cause a split
between the scientists and “tradi-
tionalists,’ humanitarians. While
the scientists are the “significant
force in our future,” most people
will remain on the other side of
the fence.

If Western peoples are experienc-
ing difficulty in assimilating the
continuing scientific revolution, the
Soviet Union may have already
bannished humanist and cultural
progress in favor of science. Soviet
education succeeds in developing
the scientific mind at the expense
of the ability to understand social
and political problems.

By STEVE SMITH

The United States National Stu-
dent Association passed a platform
of 78 declarations of policy at its
14th National Student Congress last
August; their policy has been and
will be disseminated as representa-
tive of American student opinion
before the public and before such
groups as the American Council on
Education, the International Stu-
dent Conference, the United States
Commission for UNESCO (the
United Nations committee on edu-
cation), the American Committee for
the United Nations, the Council on
Student Travel, the World Universi-
ty Service, the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare,
and Congressional committees.

This impressive list of connections
easily makes the NSA the most im-

 

portant U.S. student confederation.

 

 

' Lee’s Administration Praised
As ‘Bold, Wise And Foresighted’

Dr. Fred C. Cole told a Founder’s Day University Assem-

and Lee is continuing to achieve progress in many fields. He
said that “‘the state of the University is good.”

Forensic Meet
Hears Mosby
Wednesday

By MALCOLM MORRIS

A challenging speech by Leyburn
Mosby and a debate on national
labor unions highlighted the For-
ensic Union meeting Wednesday
night.

After an introduction by Julian
Markham, Mosby, a senior, spoke on
“America’s Challenge.” In the speech
he urged that Americans realize
and use their abilities to the fullest.

The debate concerned the National
Debate Question for this school
year, Resolved: That labor organi-
zations should be under the juris-
diction of antitrust legislation.
Sophomores Bill Noell and Joe
Volpe debated the affirmative
against negative team Charles Mc-
Cord, junior, and Robin Wood, sen-
ior.

Non-participating members of
Washington and Lee’s debate team
served as judges. Judges Al Eckes
and Jay Clark voted for the affirma-
tive on the basis of general impres-
sion. Bill Boardman dissented, vot-
ing negative because of the nega-
tive’s clear organization and argu-
ment. A vote of all present totaled
24-13 in favor of the affirmative,
supporting the split decision.

Faculty advisor William Chaffin,
always on the outlook for debating
skill, especially noted the fine de-
bating on the part of Volpe, a
novice to W&L debating.

The Forensic Union meets periodi-
cally to discuss topics of timely in-
terest and of special interest to the
university.

 

Freshman Dorm, Gym
Scene of Several Thefts

Bob Murray, Washington and Lee
University proctor, expressed con-
cern today over the incidence of
petty larceny in the school’s gym-
nasium.

The proctor stated that since the
Thanksgiving Holidays a total of
twelve wallets have been stolen or
rifled in the lockerroom of the gym-
nasium,

The University’s Freshman dormi-
tory has also been the scene of a
considerable amount of thievery.

Murray says that he has no clue
as to who the culprit may be, but
he hopes to uncover the mystery
soon,

Policies “Entirely Liberal”

The policies of NSA are entirely
liberal in character. Although a
Brinkley report on television this
week showed a conservative element
working in the association, this
element has no power and the poli-
cies passed by NSA sharply belie
the much-publicized propaganda
that a conservative movement is
sweeping American campuses today.
If there is a conservative trend

ago and now making its loud voice
heard.

THE RING-TUM PHI

General Lee’s University Today

Each year, on January 19, the regular class work of the
University is suspended and the president addresses the faculty
and the student body on the present state of the University,
in honor of Robert E. Lee’s birthday.

General Lee, of course, is primarly remembered for the
greatness of character which he brought to the presidency of
Washington College. His personal honesty and self-discipline
shone so brightly that everyone connected with Washington
and Lee is honored by their association with his university.

In a time when the educational system of the United
States is in flux, and when we face problems at home and in
international affairs that equal in magnitude those of the mid-
nineteenth century, it would be well for us to consider care-
fully Lee’s example and his heritage to us today.

We suspect he would be very pleased with the University,
and would feel that the shortcomings are far outweighed by the
good points.

His injunction that “‘all our students are gentlemen’”’ is
still honored by the faculty and the administration, if not by the
students. Our professors treat us like adults and we have been
allowed an even larger measure of self-government, by the
formation of the new Student Control Committee. General
Lee would have been vastly proud of the University’s decision
to drop subsidized athletics and form a new league in which
the members have “full respect for the integrity of the other
members. That is a page out of Lee’s book.

He would have taken a justifiable pride in the success of
our football team, but would probably not have worried too
much about the relative lack of success of some of our other
teams, on the theory that participation in manly sports for a
large number of students was the important thing. What a dis-
appointment it would be, though, for the good General to see
the glorified game periods which pass for physical education
here. Or the shoddy conditions of Doremus gymnasium, the
playing fields, and the tennis courts.

We think that General Lee would have been pleased with
the new science buildings going up behind the Law School, for
he saw in science a way for the conquered South to regain her

economic strength. Washington and Lee experienced a sound
physical development during his presidency.

General Lee could come back to see the Commerce,
Journalism, and Law schools which were added to the Univer-
sity under him still flourishing, if somewhat divorced from
the work of the rest of the school.

The Robert E. Lee research grants have proven a great
stimulus to the academic work of the University in their first
year of operation and will probably turn out to be one of the
most important innovations of the past few years.

Under President Cole, there have been a number of
minor improvements in the administration of the University,
which should prove telling in their total effect.

Far and away the most encouraging aspect of the Univer-
sity at present is the feeling that the new president is anxious
to have professors remain active in the scholarship of their re-
spective fields. The surprising number of new courses, as yet
unannounced, that will appear in the spring catalogue should
be evidence enough of the healthy intellectual atmosphere on
campus.

Yet, with all these signs of redoubled growth at W&L,
there seems something lacking. The missing quality seems to us
to be Lee’s sense of mission, of the importance of our work
here. Everyone pays lip service to “our present crisis,” but
no one has shown the courage and devotion of Lee in attempt-
ing to face the crisis. May we be specific?

The Board of Trustees, in October turned down a request
from a student group, which had been recommended favorably
by a faculty committee, to hear Integrationist Minister Martin
Luther King speak here. The most reasonable justification
given for the act was that W&L would lose some wealthy
donors by inviting Dr. King. Frankly, we would be willing to
give up a few very badly needed new buildings or professor-
ships rather than lose our right to hear whom we want to speak
on campus.

Further, the furor in the fall avoided the real question.
Just how should we stand on integration? To a university that

has chosen to emphasize our Southern tradition, the future of
race relations in the South should be a prime concern. We
think it would be a mistake to integrate W&L at the present
time, but we should at least concern ourselves more deeply
with this complex and explosive issue. Should we fail to face it,
we will be abdicating our responsibility to provide the future
leadership of the South and of the nation. For integration
is the biggest issue in the United States today, and will in all
probability continue to be so in our lifetimes.

President Cole chose to emphasize Washington and Lee’s
progress in the sciences and her hopes for their future here
in today’s “state of the University” speech. In the process,
he pointed out another issue that we are just beginning to deal
with: the divorce between the sciences and the humanities. The
University has given the freshman mathematics program a
shot in the arm and there will be a course offered in the history
department next year in history of science and technology.
But the present science requirements for a W&L degree do
not assure sound acquaintance of science on the part of the
graduates. The whole problem has been besmogged by an
unfortunate parochialism on the part of both scientists and
humanists. Each is reluctant to allow the other an entrance
into his own area, to give up one bit of his present hold on the
student’s time. All of us will have to concern ourselves in-
creasingly with the application of science in business and the
professions. It seems unfortunate that the Washington and
Lee student remains so ignorant in these areas. (See the inter-
view with Dr. Shillington on this page today for one faculty
view of the problem.)

Washington and Lee is cautiously bringing her curriculum
up to date. But in this area and in others of great importance,
such as the teaching of foreign languages and of geography,
she is still doing an inadequate job. The acid test for our sense
of purpose will be in our response to the needs of United States
leadership in a small, small world. May we justify General Lee’s
faith in this University by moving forward courageously and
confidently into the second half of the twentieth century, as
he brought us into the second half of the nineteenth.

Love And Life In South Viet Nam

By Howard Slater

Tuesday night I made a profound
error by tuning in on Science’s
impediment to daily assignments.
The highlight of my viewing eve-
ning was a saga about a dedicated
young Peace Corpsman in Viet
Nam, on “Also Presents.” Fred As-
taire was the host (hah!). It seems
that the stout-hearted young Amer-
ican isn’t so ugly after all. In fact,
he’s a great guy: he helps the vil-
lagers, works with the villagers,
loves one of the villagers (yeecch)
and so on. But those ratty Com-
munists come along and try to take
over. Lover boy is helpless. The
villagers won’t fight. Communism
has won another ideological Rush
Week.

But then, Southeast Asia’s answer
to the Cavalry comes (in the nick of
time), the day is saved—and, in
the end, everybody’s in the village

 

creek taking a community bath, and
the hero is making time— right in
the middle of the creek mind you—
with Indo-China’s answer to Suzie
Wong. Great!

This is realistic drama, of course,
because our villagers have been mo-
tivated by the old devil conscience.
They come to their senses after see-
ing just how cool the American is
in comparison to the Communists—
not a decent apple in the bunch, and
not even family men at that.

This is realistic drama? Well,
maybe not, but we are inclined to
forgive and forget. This is, after all,
the kind of trash we’re used to--
on television, the movies, magazines,
even comic strips. It’s a pleasant note
on which to end the day, so that all
across America, everybody who’s got
an 8:25 can get to sleep—cheerfully,
and quickly.

But what if you’ve got a 10:15? I

 

do. So I stayed up and thought
about this work of art which I had
just seen. And my thoughts led to
this question: How many of us will
end up fighting those Viet Cong
soldiers? A foolish thought—my eye!
What will be the percentage from
the class of ’62 killed in Southeast
Asia? Who will perform better on
the average in the jungles of Loas,
the fraternity man or the non-fra-
ternity man? Sounds like a ques-
tionnaire from the Registrar’s office,
or the Alumni Organization. Very
funny—or just boring fancy. Either
way, the whole thing’s ridiculous.
Is it? I have a brother in the
Navy, on a ship based out of Japan,
patrolling the South China Sea. My
mother wouldn’t laugh at those
random thoughts in the previous
paragraph. If she knew then what
she knows now, she’d have prayed
for my brother to be stationed in

 

Henry Apologizes To Trustees,
Local Cops, McHenry, Readers

By STEVE HENRY

It is this time of year, when the
semester is rushing to a close amidst
great flurries of research and pre-
examination cram sessions, that in-
spires the columnist to make his
peace with all those wonderful in-
dividuals out there in reader-land
whom he has offended during the
past four months.

Such is the theme of our column
today.

Our first apology goes to the Lex-
ington Police Department which was
the target of a column entitled
“Crime and Punishment in Lexing-
ton,” Forgive us, forgive us a thou-
sand times over for creating a
farce about you when the truth
would have sufficed.

Dear Bob...

Apology number two goes out to
Bob McHenry, who was not the most
pleased man in the world with

 

the column entitled “What’s Wrong
with Basketball Here?” If we had
known you were beyond reproach,
we would have never done it,
honest. The success of the Generals
this year has certainly made us see
the folly of our ill-timed words.

Our next apology is directed at
all those people who had something
to do with the Martin Luther King
business. We were entirely out of
place and presumptious to say any-
thing about the matter. After all,
we only go to school here.

Apology number four is for the
alumnus who complained to a mem-
ber of the faculty that we and
Thorns Craven were responsible for
turning the Ring-tum Phi into a
“high school publication.” That’s
certainly a reasonable estimate, sir,
wherever you are. It thrills our
hearts to know W&L’s old grads
think enough about the school to
protect it from things like Thorns
and us that might destroy it.

A New Leaf

Our last apology goes to those
people who accused us of being too
light, flippant, sarcastic, giddy, gay
and disrespectful .This is one that
really hurts us, and we want to dis-
prove it in this column. For those
people who would like to see us
write on something significant, here
we go:

Love, death, sex, marriage, liter-
ature, history, philosophy, sociology,
Freud, Kennedy, war, peace, relig-
ion.

Also time, space, perspective,
meaning, perverseness, politics, wo-
men, music and existentialism.

Not to mention art, Hedonism,
Bergman, Salinger, nuclear devices,
disarmament, bomb shelters, and the
magazine industry.

We could go on and on, but this
is enough deep thinking to keep you
occupied at least through exams.

 

End of apology!

 

Morocco—and that’s no oasis for a
number of reasons. Now she’s very
much concerned.

Well there she is, and there’s
America, the world, us all. The point
being, of course, that who cares if
a few H-bombs fall, as long as they
don’t fall on our families our homes,
this side of the Blue Ridge, or
where we intend to spend spring va-
cation?

Here’s another far - fetched
thought—Fred Astaire was the host.
Now putting Twinkletoes into his-
torical perspective, was he not popu-
lar in the 30’s, not so much in the
public eye in the 40’s, and coming
back strong in the late 50’s and 60’s.
This could be the clue we’ve been
looking for. (The last sentence to be
read in an excited tone.) Fred’s pop-
ular only after a war’s been through
for ten years or so. Hmmmm?

So there he was, at the end of the
show, palming off these classic lines:
“Those Viet Namese have a delight-
ful way to bathe, don’t they?”

Sure Fred, they must be having a
ball. Everybody stops fighting when
it’s time to clean up. That’s why the
bloody war is taking so long.

It’s a rare moment when you real-
ly feel what otherwise you just
know logically to be true. I had a
feeling after that show, though not
because of it, that it is a logical pos-
sibility that there would be another
simple cleaning up job like Korea.

If we feel things like this, then
we will care enough about this
thing to start acting on the feeling
Perhaps this would be a new ingre-
dient to add to the forces fighting

to solve the “problems of the
world”—this ingredient of people
caring.

Now war’s a big problem, and
telling people that the rest of the
world is going to solve its problems
and that we won’t have to get in-
volved, not with Peace Corpsmen,
much less with soldiers—now that’s
the kind of thing that leads to shrug-
ged shoulders, and people not caring.

Therefore, I have a solution—let’s
shoot all the guys who concoct
these grade-Z lullabyes, so that my
brother, me, you and a lot of other
guys won’t get shot in the long run.

There has alawys been a sort of
dichotemy between intellect and rea-
son on the one hand, and emotions
on the other. This same conflict
exists and has existed for a long
time between the scientist and the
artist.

The world of the scientist and
the realm of the artist have, for
seemingly a number of reasons,
split into two separate areas of
pursuit. Society’s attitude appears
to be that a man must be either one
or the other—and most men follow
this line of thought.

Because of this attitude of separa-

tion, the gap between the sciences
and the humanities has been wid-
ened, creating a very real problem
of misunderstanding between the
two.

Chemistry professor Dr. J. K.
Shillington defended the present po-
sition of the scientist against that of
the artist. “The scientist understands
the artist much better than the
artist understands the scientist,” he
said.

“There is not much attempt made
to understand the scientist,” Dr.
Shillington added. “It could be that
the scientist has been forced to learn
about the artist whether he wanted
to or not.”

On the question of which is more
important, he called both areas
“equally acceptable,” but remarked
that “chemistry and science are with
a person from the time of his incep-
tion.”

Dr. Shillington implied that sci-
ence and scientists have been subor-
dinated to the humanities.

“The problem,” he said, “arose
when man decided that the spiritual
was above the material. The material
side of things bothers people The
feeling still prevails that the things
of the spirit are more worthy than
the things of the body.”

Dr. Shillington took issue with this
pushing-out of the physical, and
claimed that “the body is just as
important as the soul.”

The basic problem which comes
out of the separation of the two
fields is that of misunderstanding,
according to Dr. Shillington. “The
scientists finds few people who can
talk science with him.”

“Today it is a problem of mis-
education. While we get the arts and
literature practically from the time
we start school, we don’t really get
into the sciences until high school.”

Asked about the so-called “gen-
eral science” courses for the artist,
Dr. Shillington voiced strong disap-
proval. “The artis insists that we
teach general courses in the history
of science, its basic concepts, etc.
This accomplishes nothing. It only
scratches the surface, and is com-
parable to requiring the scientist to
learn only the ABC’s and stop
there.”

He also doubted if the science
requirement of one year of “general”
nature such as at W&L for majors in
the humanities did any good.

Dr. Shillington suggested, instead,
that four years of a singe science be

Bridgewater Defeats Generals, 69-65,

Overtime Win

Bridgewater’s Eagles came up
with a solid defense and tripped the
Generals 69-65 in overtime Tuesday
night before an estimated 700 fans.

The eagles led by as much as 11
points during the second half, but
a late W&L rally, climaxed by Bip
Fauber’s long jumper with 11 sec-
onds to play, sent the game into
overtime.

In the overtime, Bridgewater high
scorer John Edwards, who had 32

Hall Of Fame
Group Praises

Amateur CAC

Washington and Lee pres-
ident Fred C. Cole has receiv-
ed a letter complimenting the
school’s non-subsidized ath-
letic policy from Chester J.
LaRoche, president of the Na-
tional Football Foundation

and Hall of Fame. Mr. La-

Roche’s letter:

Dear President Cole,

The stand taken by your college
in continuing football off the field
with the same sense of amateurism
and decency in which it is played
and officiated on the field is a poli-
cy identical with the National Foot-
ball Foundation.

Congratulations on what you are
trying to do. It is very heartening
to all of us. WE hope that more
and more colleges will recognize
that they should not treat boys like
“hired hands,’ persuading them to
think of an education in terms of
who pays the biggest laundry bill.

The fact is that boys who play
football want to meet their class-
mates on equal terms. If they are
given all sides of the problem, we
find many just want a chance to
earn their way through college.

I think it must be perfectly clear
that we're absolutely against any
de-emphasis in football. What we’re
for is emphasis on its being contin-
ued as a part of an educational
system and kept “amateur” in its
recruitment practices.

Cordially,
Chester J. LaRoche

The National Football Foundation
has as its aim the backing up of
“educators who are trying to keep
football a true amateur sport.” It
tries to maintain the reputation of
the sport by publicity and informa-
tion for the general public and by
the building of a national Football
Hall of Fame at Rutgers University,
where the first intercollegiate foot-
ball game was played in the United
States. The officers of the Founda-
tion include former Army Coach
Earl Blaik. General Douglas Mac-
Arthur is chairman of the National
Advisory Board of the Foundation.

W&L Honored
By Washington

Organization

“It was a great tribute to a grand
bunch of boys.”

That’s how Washington and Lee
head football coach described the
Washington Ttouchdown Club’s an-
nual football awards banquet held
in D.C. last Saturday.

Accepts Trophy

McLaughlin was there to accept
the club’s “Outstanding Small Col-
lege Football Team” trophy for the
Generals, and he was in plenty out-
standing company.

Also receiving awards at the ban-
quet were Green Bay half back
Paul Hornung, New York Yankee
pitcher Whitey Ford, Syracuse full-
back Ernie Davis, and Navy All-
American end Greg Mather.

“It was, of course, very impres-
sive,’ said McLaughlin. “We felt
singularly honored to receive the
award.

The TD club trophy, symbolic
of supremacy in small college foot-
ball, now rests in the showcase in
Doremus Gym.

“We owe it all to the boys,” Mc-
Laughlin said, speaking of the team
that posted a 9-0 record this year.
“They were wonderful.”

$25 a Plate
Athletic Director Cy Twombly
other members of the General

coaching staff attended the banquet
to watch McLaughlin accept the
trophy from Speaker of the House
Charles McCormick before 1,500
guests who paid $25 a plate for
the privilege.

McLaughlin showed excerpts from
W&L game films to the crowd, and
received “many favorable com-
ments” on the Generals’ perform-
ance,

of W&L’s reach.

Fauber led the Generals with 15
points, and guard Louis Paterno
added 14.

Coach Bob McHenry, admittedly
disappointed after the Bridgewater
loss, said that the Generals couldn’t
get their offense going against an
Eagle defense “geared to disorganize
our plays. We couldn’t ever recov-
er.”

McHenry started freshman Gene
Pearce in the center position, bench-
ing regular center Bill Smith who
has had his problems scoring against
much taller opposition this year.

Pearce, however, came up with a
somewhat less than spectacular per-
formance, and Smith will return to
the starting lineup against William
and Mary Saturday.

Smith is just one of the Generals
suffering from minor injuries after
the Bridgewater game. He has a foot
injury, Paterno has a pulled muscle,
and Fauber has a knee ailment.

 

Grapplers Oppose Norfolk
William and Mary Sat.

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
wrestlers face Norfolk William and
Mary in Doremus Gymnasium at
7 p.m. Saturday.

The Generals have an impressive
4-1 record, but expect tough oppo-
sition from the Indians.

Coach Dick Miller will go with
Butch West in the 130 ponnd class;
Dave Montgomery, 137-pound; Dick
Albert, 167-pound; Herb Smith, 177-
pound; Jud Babcock, heavyweight
and unlimited.

Norfolk William and Mary always
produces a strong wrestling team,
thanks to the large number of Nor-
folk boys attending the school.

Norfolk is a perennial state high
school wrestling power, and pro-
duces many fine college matmen.

I-M Action Stops For Exams,

Phi Psi Wrestlers Unbeaten

Withstanding a last minute rally
by PiKA, the grapplers from Phi Psi
remained undefeated by downing
their opponents 20-15. Phi Psi has
only one contest left, a February 8
encounter against Phi Delt.

After both teams forfeited in the
initial match, Pete Alford of Phi
Psi put his team in the lead by
pinning Greg Lebedev in the second
period. Junior Walt Erickson made
the score 10-0 by gaining a pin in
the 137 lb. Class.

Frosh Paul McCoy gave PiKA
its first score when he came from
behind to pin his counterpart in the
final period. PiKA Walt Kennedy
tied the contest as he also won by
a pin, defeating Al Owen.

Baby Generals
Face Ferrum
Here Saturday

Fresh from a 71-62 win over
the Bridgewater JV, Washington
and Lee’s freshman basketball team
returns home tomorrow afternoon
for a game against powerful Ferrum
Junior College.

Ferrum is probably the best team
the Baby Generals will face this
year. Its record includes a win over
VMI’s freshmen.

Game time is 4:30.

Seventh Win

The victory over Bridgewater
brought the Baby Generals’ season
record to an impressive 7-1.

Jerry Kowalski hit 22, Dick Liv-
ingston had 13, and George Madison
had 11 to pace the winning effort.

Coach Joe Lyles, who called Fer-
rum “one of the best basketball
teams in the state at any level,”
said he’ll start Madison and Liv-
ingston at the forward positions,
Kowalski in the pivot, and Girard
and Varner at the guards.

Norfolk W&M Plays Here Tomorrow

Solid Defense ~

) jLast Outing
|| Hands Eagles

Before Exams

Washington and Lee gets one
more chance to pick up its fourth
first semester basketball win when
the Generals meet Norfolk William
and Mary here tomorrow night.
Game time is 8 p.m.

Although sporting an unimpres-
sive season’s record, the Indians
have managed to split in two games
with Little Eight power Hampden-
Sydney and W&L head coach Bob
McHenry calls them “good, tall and
experienced.”

Tom Bettis

Center Tom Bettis ,who played in
high-scoring Leo Anthony’s shadow
last year, has taken over as W&M’s
big gun this year, averaging over
18 points a game. He’s 6’6” and
plenty tough around the boards.

Joining him up front is rebound-
ing specialist Fred Dougan, who got
24 rebounds against Hampden-Syd-
ney.

High Scoring

The Indians build their offense
around a highscoring fast break
triggered by the rebounding of
Bettis and Dougan. They scored 96
points in their last action, a 96-84
win over H-S.

“The only way we can win this
game is with desire, hustle and a
good team effort,” said McHenry.

McHenry will go with his regular
starting five against the Indians.

That will be Tom Supac and
Louie Paterno at the guards, Bip
Fauber and Bill Ide at the for-
wards, and Bill Smith in the pivot.

The Generals are 3-6 for the year.

terest to students—from higher edu-
cation for the American Indian, to
dictatorship in Latin America, to
free expression of ideas.

Of 78 declarations of the last NSA
convention, only 13 were passed by
the assembly of delegates; the re-
maining 65 were passed by the 35-
member Executive Committee after
the convention. This, then, is the
most important fault pointed out
by NSA critics: that an unrepresen-
tative € 20 per cent of American
higher institutions) body should
claim to be “most representative,”
and should pass resolutions unrep-
resentative of its own constituency.

Congress Is Unrepresentative

The NSA boast, that elected dele-
gates of member schools vote on a
platform at the annual Congress, is
mere propaganda. The resolutions
of the Executive Committee carry
as much authority as those of the
Congress. The fact that the EC
is omnipotent ensures that the ac-
tive conservative minority will re-
main powerless and unheard, since
the conservatives cannot be ef-
fective in the _ indirectly-elected
Committee.

NSA resolutions as published in-
clude usually a declaration or man-
date of action. These may be ad-
dressed to all American students,
to NSA officers, to the U.S. Cong-
ress, or to almost any group or
authority.

NSA claims that it “has in the
past reflected the sympathy of the
American student community for
the goals of the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee by
cooperating with that organization,”
and therefore supports it by: recom-
mending that member schools par-
ticipate in picketing and selective
buying campaigns (boycots), and
send letters, wires, and messages of
protest to proper parties.

NSA Debates Are Planned

on Un-American Activities, the NSA member. Uncas McThenia, student

strongly urges the abolition of the
committee, and has directed its
National Affairs Vice-President to
compile an informative resolution
and to send this resolution to all
members of the U.S. Congress.

NSA urges the world’s nuclear
powers to remain at negotiating
tables in an effort to arrive at a
cessation of nuclear testing. It has
denounced Soviet Russia’s resump-
tion of testing, and sent its denun-
ciation to “newspaper, press serv-
ices, and to President Kennedy.”

It has expressed general disap-
proval of the government’s asking
students to take loyalty oaths, and
mandated NSA national officers to
“Use all means permissable to per-
suade the U.S. Congress of the im-
portance of removing the require-
ment of students’ affirming loyalty
before receiving Federal scholarship
funds.

Favors Federal Aid

Claiming that it is necessary that
Federal aid be given to elementary
and secondary schools, NSA asks
for teacher salary and construction
aid to state schools. However, it
would deny aid to schools which
discriminate against any group.

Many national social groups con-
tinue discriminatory practices, says
the NSA; it demands that discrimi-
nation against race, color, religion,
creed, or national orgin be ended
in social organizations.

Through hundreds of such reso-
lutions, the NSA has exerted the
opinion of its members.

Washington and Lee has this year
received “feelers” from the NSA re-

 

body president, and Craig Distle-
horst, junior, plan a debate on the
NSA and its policies at Sweet Briar
and Randolph-Macon February 13.
They will meet representatives of
the Virginia-Carolinas Region NSA.
The debate has been planned for
some weeks, and has been canceled
and re-scheduled twice previously.

taken. He haid that this was
a better alternative than merely
skimming the surface of a science.

Concluding, he pointed out that
the problem of subordination will
continue to exist—despite educa-
tion—as long as we rate the material
of lesser importance than the spiri-
tual.

Again he reiterated the importance
of having both. “We must have
both—every man individually must,
if he is to be decently educated.”

Fishwick also stated that until he

cy was referring, he could only

Col. Blaik has donated part of
the income from his weekly football
column to scholarships for college
athletes who are also outstanding
students,

The Foundation, which points out
that they do not want to de-empha-
size football, is, moreover, opposed
to the encroachment of “big busi-
ness” in football and to “the ex-
cessive payments, the hidden bar-
gains, the avoidance of proper en-

the New York Times described the
by-laws of the conference as follows:

“The new conference’s articles of
organization state forthrightly the
principles to which the NS.A.A.
theoretically subscribes but must
talk around to keep peace in the
ranks...

“Without fudging, (these provi-
sions) get right to the heart of
what constitutes ‘proper conduct of
intercollegiate sports’ as defined
even by those who stray from the
line in practice...

“The articles make other telling
points...

“If enough other institutions adopt
and live up to these principles, the
N.C.A.A. in future years will not
have to waste so much time on such
gnat-slapping proposals as barring
outside competition in basketball.”
