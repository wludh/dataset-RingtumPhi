Senator Albert Gore
Announces IRW Topic

Senator Albert Gore, who will be the principle speaker for Washington
and Lee’s International Relations Week, announced the topic for his

Tuesday evening speech from his Washington office Thursday. He will
draw attention to the “United States Foreign Policy in the Congo”—a sub-
ject of vital concern in today’s struggle for power in the world.

As chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs in the Senate |_

Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Gore is considered one of the most
important men in the country in this field.

Senator Gore’s arrival Tuesday will be marked by a large state-wide
press conference here. Later, a dinner will be held in his honor at Evans
Dining Hall at 5:45 p.m. Faculty members of the Political Science Depart-
ment have been invited as well as members of the host International
Relations Club, Pi Sigma Alpha, and selected students. The dinner is
$2.50 per plate and will feature a short after-dinner talk by the Senator
to the guests. The principal speech is scheduled at Lee Chapel at 7:30 p.m.

 

Federal Research Expert

Discusses Southeast Asia

By LARRY MEEKS

“Southeast Asia has something
for everyone in the academic field,’
John E. MacDonald told a Washing-
ton and Lee audience this morning.
For the historian there is a rich and
varied history of the rise and fall
of dynasties, and an equally fertile
field for economists, political sci-
entists, and students of geo-politics.

MacDonald, a native of New
Hampshire, is the State Depart-
ment’s Chief of Research for South-
east Asia. A graduate of Yale, he has
been with the State Department
since 1945. He received his current
appointment last July. He has
worked in China, Japan and Korea.

He serves as an advisor to Sec-
retary of State Dean Rusk and
other state department officials. He
also spends time in interdepartmen-
tal affairs such as preparing papers

Debaters Plan
TV Appearance

By STEVE SMITH

Washington and Lee’s debating
team, which is at King’s College
this weekend for its second major
tournament in two weeks, will ap-
pear on television March 12.

The team will face the winner of
a Duke-North Carolina match on
WUNC, debating the topic “Re-
solved: That the United States
should withdraw from the United
Nations.” The program will run
from 9 to 10 o’clock p.m.

The appearance will take place on
a regular debating program which
is watched by several millions of
people.

Team In Roanoke Feb. 19

In another demonstration debate
a week later, the team will appear
before a Roanoke high school. The
school was invited by the high
school to put on a model debate on
Feb. 19.

This weekend the team is at
King’s College, Wilkes-Barre, Penn-

 

sylvania, facing such _ perennial
powers as Dartmouth, Duquesne,
Fordham, Penn State, Pittsburgh,

Villanova, and Ohio. The negative
team is composed of Bill Noell and
Al Eckes, while Jay Clark and Ed
Norton are debating the affirmative
resolution.

The King’s Tournament is a
strength-against-strength match,
meaning that the winning teams
face winning teams in the late
rounds, while losing teams come up
against losing teams.

Noell and Eckes Shine

In the Johns Hopkins Tournament
last weekend, Noell and Eckes
earned a 3-3 record in a strength-
against-strength arrangement. After
trouncing powerful Kings College in
the first round the duo had to face
strong teams for the remainder of
the tournament.

Normally negative debaters, they
won every round in which they
drew the negative side, while losing
their 3 affirmative matches. They
finished 16th in a field of over 40
which included many of the top
debaters in the nation.

Noell also won third place in the
extemporaneous speaking contest,
failing to bring home a second place
award by a narrow margin. He
spoke on the “Success of the Peace
Corps To Date” with 10 minutes
preparation.

Freshman Steve Smith also en-
tered the extemporaneous category
but failed to place.

 

on “the prospects for country X for
the next three years.”

In the beginning of his discussion
he emphasized the importance of
Southeast Asia, with an area 1,600,-
000 square miles and a population of
200,000,000.

Southeast Asia, said MacDonald,
provides a boundary between the
Hindu Culture and the Chinese Cul-
ture.

He discussed “the transition from
colonial states that has oecurred in
the last 16 years.” This transition
was preceded by three factors, “na-

tionalism, anti-colonialism, and the |}

feeling for independence.”

Another major factor is the local
pride in the historical and cultural
aspects. Each country looks for
something to make it unique.

Educated People Pro-Socialist

The influence of Marxist thought
has been important. The educated
class as a whole are pro-socialist
but not pro-communist, MacDonald
said.

The U.S. influence, which has
grown as colonialism disappeared,
must also be considered.

In his summary he brought out
the influence of the Malayan insur-
rection. This success provides a
precedent for the other nations in
the fight against Communism. It
set the precedent for Viet Nam’s
fight against Communism.

The U.S. Problems

He concluded that a great change
has been coming about in Southeast
Asia since World War II. The Unit-
ed States wants to maintain the peo-
ple’s newly gained independence—
but there are problems. One of these
is that the United States is dealing
with agricultural people, many of
whom wish to continue as they have
been through the centuries. They
must be reconciled to change and
realize that these changes are for
their benefit.

Math Programs
To Be Studied

The chairman of the committee
on undergraduate mathematics pro-
grams of the Mathematical Asso-
ciation of America will speak Feb.
19 and 20 at Washington and Lee.

Dr. R. Creighton Buck, a mem-
ber of the University of Wiscon-
sin faculty, will discuss the appli-
cation of mathematics and mathe-
matical research before advanced
classes here. He also will speak at
a public session at 8 p.m. Feb. 19 in
the university’s duPont Auditorium.

His topic will be “Research in
Mathematics.”
Professor Buck’s work with the

national association is involved with
the improvement of college mathe-
matical curricula. His research in-
terests are function theory and
algebraic analysis. He is the author
of several books and over 40 re-
search papers.

A 1941 graduate of the University
of Cincinnati, Dr. Buck was a Jun-
ior Fellow in the Harvard Society
of Fellows. He received his Ph.D.
degree from Harvard in 1947. He has
served as a member of the Brown
University faculty.

As a Guggenheim Fellow, he was
guest professor at Stanford Univer-
sity in 1958-59 and the following
year he was a staff member of the
Communications Research Division
of the Institute for Defense Analy-
ses in Princeton.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 9, 1962

 

Mr. Coleman and Dr. Moger with new Lee Letters.

 

Two Lee Letters, Worth $4500,
Are Willed To The University

Two of General Robert E. Lee’s
letters to President Jefferson, vauled
at $4,500, have been added to
Washington and Lee’s collection of
more than 5,000 Lee letters.

The letters, bound in a red mo-
rocco leather case, are dated August
22, 1863, and February 9, 1965, and
were willed to the university by
the late Alfred W. Stern, a Chi-
cago clothing executive.

The correspondence presents an
interesting contrast in the career
of the famous Confederate general
who later became president of
Washington College here. The Au-
gust letter--written at Lee’s head-
quarters at Orange Courthouse—in-
dicates that General Lee regrets that
President Davis will not consider
Lee’s request to be relieved of his
post and permit him to serve “in
any capacity at any post where I
can do good.

General Lee thought that “the
lower the position, the more suit-
able” to his ability and the more
“agreeable” to his feelings.

The 1865 letter, composed at Lee’s
Petersburg headquarters, is Gener-
al Lee’s acceptance of the post of
General-in-Chief (commanding gen-
eral) of the Confederate Army. He
had been commander of the Army of
Northern Virginia until his appoint-
ment in the last two months of the
war.

The letters are valued at more
than $4,500, according to Earl S.
Mattingly, Washington and Lee
treasurer.

Stern, a retired officer of Kup-
penhiem & Co, Ince. in Chicago,
died May 3, 1960. In his will, he
requested that the letters be given
to Washington and Lee. Neighbor-
ing Virginia Military Institute re-
ceived an original letter by Gen-
eral Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson
through Stern’s will. More than
5,000 books, letters and pamphlets
concerning Abraham Lincoln were
willed by Stern to the Library of
Congress along with a $25,000 trust
fund for the library’s use.

Generals Lee’s letters will be
placed with some 5,000 other Lee

 

Hollins Literary Festival

Hollins College’s annual Liter-
ary Festival begins on February 17,
featuring Randall Jarrell, William
Golding, John Aldridge, and Rob-
ert Hazel.

Jarrell and Hazel will read from
their poetry.

Aldridge will present a lecture
on “the Irrelevance of Outrage in
Recent Southern Fiction.” Golding’s
lecture is entitled “An Innocent

 

Abroad.”

 

items, according to Dr. Allen W.
Moger, Washington and Lee profes-
sor of history and Lee archivist.
The complete collection of Lee ma-
terial is open to scholars for in-
spection and research.

Several additional Lee letters also
have been added to the university’s
archives. Mrs. Armistead L. Long,
a Lynchburg resident, donated let-
ters by General Lee and one by
Mrs. Lee. One of the documents,
written to General Armistead R.
Long shortly after the surrender at
Appomattox, tells of Lee’s desire
to find “some little quiet house in
the woods” to get his wife away
from the city. The letter from Mrs.
Lee is addressed to Miss Virginia
Long, General Long’s daughter.

The donor is the widow of the
nephew of General Long to whom
General Lee wrote.

“We at Washington and Lee feel
that these letters are a_ significant
contribution to our Lee Archives,”
Dr. Moger said. “They enhance our
already extensive collection, and I
am certain they will prove to be of
value to many Lee scholars who
visit our library.”

 

Marine Corps Officer
Will Interview for PLC

Marine Corps officer selection of-
ficer will be on campus February 12
and 13 to interview students for
Marine Corps officer training pro-
grams. The Officer selected team
will be at W&L to provide informa-
tion and interview applicants.

Freshmen and sophomore men
attend a 6-week increments of Pla-
toon Leaders Class training at Quan-
tico, Virginia during their summer
vacations. Juniors attend a 12-week
summer training session the sum-
mer prior to Graduation.

Applicants are commissioned sec-
ond lieutenants immediately upon
graduation. Seniors and graduates
attend a 10-Week officer candidate
course after graduation and are
then commissioned.

For qualified applicants, Platoon
Leaders Class (aviation) and avia-
tion officer candidates courses are
available.

There are no training commit-
ments during the school year.

Members of the PLC are not re-
quired to complete any special col-

lege courses, but are required to
maintain an overall “C” average,
successfully complete the summer

training, and earn a_ baccalaureate
degree before being commissioned.

All time spent in the program is
counted for pay purposes upon as-
signment to active duty.

The elimination of Hell
and Lee fraternities and the
community service mark the
closes tonight.

 

New Major:
Contemporary
Civilization

A new history major, in
Contemporary _—__ Civilization,

and an advanced placement
program for freshmen will be
added to the Washington and
Lee curriculum next year,
Dean of the College William
W. Pusey announced today.

The new Contemporary Civilizza-
tion program makes a third possible
history major, in addition to the two
now offered in American and Eur-
opean history. According to Profes-
sor William G. Bean, chairman of
the history department, the new
major is designed to allow students
who have no professional interest in
history to study more in areas that
are specifically related to the prob-
lems and developments of contem-
porary events.

In an additional move to make the
curriculum more “flexible,” the his-
tory major has been reduced from
36 to 30 hours beyond History 1 and
Z

Beginning next fall, freshmen may
apply for exemption from History 1
and 2. All freshmen entering with
a verbal score of 600 or more on
their Scholastic Aptitude Test will
automatically be eligible to take a
test in European civilization and pre-
sent an essay to qualify for ad-
vanced standing. If the history de-
partment exempts them from the
freshman course, they will take six
hours in advanced history courses
instead.

Shenandoah

Features
Poet Graves

The winter issue of Shenandoah,
edited by English Instructor Doug-
las Day, will appear on the news-
stands in the next few days.

The issue features a symposium
on English poet Robert Graves, com-
prised of essays by W. H. Auden,
Thom Gunn, G. S. Fraser, D. J. En-
right, Donald Davie, Alan Sillitoe,
and Colin Wilson.

Poems by Enright, Davie, and
Sillitoe; and by Philip Larkin, Geof-
frey Hill, Ruth Fainlight, and Geof-
frey Johnson are published.

 

Book reviews by Mr. James Boat-
wright and Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy,
of the W&L English department, are
featured. Mr. Boatwright reviews
Malcolm Lowry’s Hear Us O Lord
From Heaven Thy Dwelling Place
and Dr. Flournoy reviews George
Steiner’s The Death of Tragedy.

In introductory note to the issue,
Mr. Day says of Graves: “Except
for a few pioneer essays and a
couple of brief pamphlets about him,
Robert Graves has for many years
gone without the recognition due
him as one of England’s greatest (an
adjective which Graves despises)
living poets. The issue of Shenan-
doah represents at attempt to pro-
vide his rapidly growing audience
with a number of articles, by lead-
ing critics and poets, which should
do something to establish him in the
high position he has merited for so
long. We have done this not for his
sake—he has always been rather
contemputous of his critics, and has
consistently derided any such at-
tempts to “place” him—but for our
own sakes. He may not need the
friendship of the critics, but we
need to know him far better than
we do. With all apologies to Robert
Graves, then, we herewith offer this
symposium to all who might wish
to know something more about Eng-
land’s leading poet.”

 

Number 30

Three Fraternities
Abolish Hell Week

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Week by three Washington
success of a new emphasis on

end of “Help Week” as it

* PiKA Hell Week Through

PiKA ended all pledge abuses
Wednesday night, substituting a
program of constructive activities.

Pledge Trainer Bill Outman com-
mented on the change: “PiKA Hell
Week is over for good as far as the
traditional concepts of Washingtor
and Lee’s Hell Week go. Our reason
for a change lies in a combination
of elements, found not only in our
house but in the whole student
body. We still will continue a week
of intensified pledge activity but
only along a purely constructive
line.”

Phi Gams

Phi Gamma Delta has announced
that this will be the last year of tra-
ditional Hell Week for its pledges.
President Steve Rutledge noted:

The fraternity is moving in the
direction of eliminating the tradi-
tional Hell Week at Washington
and Lee. It is hoped that next year’s
program will eliminate all traces of
the former abuse to pledges.

Rutledge said that although plans
for next year were not yet definite, a
committee of the chapter had al-
ready begun work on a more effec-
tive pledge training period. The
abolition of Hell Week by the Phi
Gams is in accordance with the urg-
ing of the national fraternity toward
a more progressive program.

Sigma Chi

Sigma Chi abolished Hell Week in
time to become the only house on
campus not to stage the period this
year. President Bob Doenges, also
President of the IFC, said that only
constructive work has been done by
pledges during this Help Week.

Emphasize Constructive Work

Pi Kappa Phi, President Mike
Herndon said, placed emphasis al-
most completely on constructive
work this year, following a trend set
in past years. The pledges worked
not only in the house, but for the
university and in the community.

Pi Phi pledges worked for the
welfare board moving food, moved
books for the library, helped a
needy farmer in the county, and
performed other similar jobs. Hern-
don commented: We feel that this is
a more reasonable approach to an
intensified pledge week.

“Very Successful”

IFC President Doenges said that
he felt the week was very success-
ful as a Help Week. Fraternities
placed more emphasis than ever be-
fore on community service, as op-
posed to hazing.

Alumni Seek Funnds:
Questionnaire Compiled

According to Bill Washburn,
Alumni Secretary, two major alumni
programs are in progress. The first
of these, the Occupations of Alumni
Program, has as its aim a file on
the occupations of all W&L alumni.
Questionnaires have ben sen _ to
10,996 and thus far 5,117 have been
returned. The program is later to
be incorporated into the IBM sys-
tem. Then completed statistics will
be available as to the exact num-
ber of professions represented. The
office has been encouraged by the
response the alumni have shown.
Estimated completion of the pro-
gram will be June.

The Annual Alumni Fund Pro-
gram of the 1961-62 fund year is to
be reactivated on a full scale basis.
In the last three years the alumni
office has not handled the full pro-
gram because the fund was merged
with the University Development
Program, which is responsible for
the various capital improvements
about the campus. The fund was
begun in 1933. That year gifts from
506 alumni for $3,700 were received.
During the 29-year interval the pro-
gram has steadily grown. The goal
set for this year is more than
$100,000, and a participation of at
least 70 per cent of all alumni is
expected.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Dance Sets Are Back

It’s interesting how we tend to take things for granted here
at Washington and Lee. Take Fancy Dress for example. This
year’s Fancy Dress Dance Set provided excellent, up-to-date
entertainment. The Ball itself was an unqualified success. Ev-
eryone agreed that the Dave Brubeck concert was one of the
best in recent years. Even the Saturday night dance was well-
attended.

And yet, no one seems to remember that, this time last
year, the formal dance sets were the jokes of the campus and
dance plans were objects of general derision.

We are not going to scold the student body for not appre-
ciating Fancy Dress. We do think, however, that Steve Galef
and Frank Young deserve a special word of thanks. The bur-
den of responsibility for the dance sets lies almost entirely in
the hands of the President and Vice-President of the Dance
Board. These are thankless offices, despite the tremendous
amount of work involved. Galef and Young have not only
provided excellent entertainment, but have, by dint of imagina-
tion and hard work, lifted the dance sets out of last year’s mire,
a noteworthy accomplishment by anybody’s standards.

A word of thnks is also due the faculty committee on so-
cial events for giving them a chance to show what they could

do with a dance set, and to Dr. Jay Cook and Dr. Charles Phil-

lips for their patient service as Dance Board advisors.

 

A Welcome Discussion

It looks like this year’s International Relations Week, which
begins Tuesday, will be another outstanding event in the
school year. Professor John Gunn and Lance Tarrance deserve
a good deal of credit for bringing a distinguished set of speak-
ers to the campus.

Senator Gore’s announcement today that he will discuss
the United States policy in the Congo, together with Professor
Nawaz’s announced plans to discuss “The United Nations at
the Crossroads,” should encourage some much-needed discus-
sion at W&L on the role of the United States in the United
Nations. We hope that everyone who can will get down to Lee
Chapel for the sessions.

The New History Major

The announcement today that the history department
ment will offer advanced placement to qualified freshmen is
proof that the overall preparation and talent of Washington
and Lee students is going up every year. For the present fresh-
man history course is an excellent course in the hands of the
department’s overwhelming majority of good teachers. It is
a stimulating and challenging course to all but the very best stu-
dents.

Advanced placement, however, should be a great advantage
to students who enter here with a very good background in
European history. And it should prove further, as the pres-
ent highly successful advanced placement programs in mathe-
matics and English do, that the University is willing to let a
student go as far as he is able as fast as he can.

We will be waiting to see the specific requirements for the
Contemporary Civilization major. The University presents a
sound group of courses now in contemporary art, literature,
and history. But we believe that it is just as important for a man
to know about the Middle Ages, or the sixteenth century, as it
is to know about the events of the last 100 years. We are sure,
however, that the history department is not deluding students
into thinking that a thorough knowledge of contemporary
events is any substitute for a sound knowledge of the whole
span of human history. It does matter, a great deal, what the
ancient Greeks, or the Carolingians, or Louis XIV, did.

By TRACY HARRINGTON

When the Dave Brubeck Quartet
emerged from the West Coast in
the early 1950’s, its music was met
with severe criticism from the pub-
lic and jazz musicians alike. Today,
however, this same organization is
the most widely acclaimed, and
along with the Modern Jazz Quar-
tet, the highest paid jazz group in
the world. This meteoric rise can
be directly attributed to the growth
of the music style of the leader.

In the early years, Brubeck was
still much under the influence of
the classical pianists and composers.
He had studied with the great Dar-
ius Milhaud, a renowned classicist.
Because of this influence, the style of
Brubeck was heavy and awkward.
Since that time, he has undergone
a miraculous musicial transition. As
opposed to the heavy, early style, his
style today is a clean, driving one.

Paul Desmond

Along with Brubeck there is one
other man who has remained with
the group since its inception. This is
Alto Saxist Paul Desmond. Prob-
ably one of the most gifted lyrical
improvisers in jazz today, Desmond’s
worth to the group is one never to
be doubted. With complete com-
mand of his horn, his solos are a
wonder of perfect tonality, rhythm,
and imagination.

The bassist in today’s quartet,
Eugene Wright, is an unobtrusive

By HOWARD SLATER

Just as students attend college for
a number of seasons, so it is also
true that students give opinions and
write columns for more than one
reason. Usually they do so because
they believe in what they have to
say.

But saying that you _ support
something, or “stand” for something
is an entirely different matter often
from actually doing so. The occur-
ance of lip-service protestations
throughout the course of history are
sufficient proof of this phenomenon.

It is also true that this lip-service
does not necessarily have to be
hypocritical. I do believe, for ex-
ample, that the medieval Church
was sincere in its belief that it act-
ed rightfully as the agent of a mild,
forgiving Jesus, when it in fact
ruthlessly surpressed deviationists,
heretics, or whatever you prefer
to call those unfortunate wretches.

“Objectivity” Problem

Therefore,, we must, in fairness,
cast the benefit of doubt in favor of
the recent article, “Too Much Opin-
ion Puts Bias Into Some Courses.”
Probably, it was a sincere article.
However, being sincere about a sup-
posed belief is not the same thing as
actually holding this belief, as we
have seen. It is one thing to demand
objectivity from our professors; it is
another thing to spell out how this
objectivity ought to be achieved.
And when the attempt is made to
spell out what is objective, what
other result is there than the ex-
change of the student’s “objective
conclusions” in place of the profes-
sor’s “subjective” opinions?

Now who is going to seriously
contend that, in a comparison of a
student’s views and a_professor’s,
that the student’s are more valid? It
is ridiculous to argue that a man
who is, comparatively speaking, an

 

expert in his field ought to subor-
| dinate his value judgments to those
| of his students.

| This is not to say that teachers are
always right—there are always ex-
ceptions. But think of how workable
the educational system would be
if it were at the mercy of all opin-
ionated, so-called “critical” students.

Why Study?
Of course, the article asserted that
only “some courses’ are biased.

“Students attend college for many
and varied reasons.” Unfortunately,
one of these reasons is the desire to
find confirmation of what one al-
ready believes. Although “The true
educational process consists of pre-
senting and exploring a subject from
| all points of view,” there is abso-
| luately no sense to it whatsoever, if
| you come out of it the same as you
| went in, without testing any of these
views—especially the ones you went
in with.
Thus, I suspect that

biased courses” actually

 

the
refer

“some
to

| those in which conclusions were

made to which the writer was pre-
conceivedly disposed to disagree
with. In that case, what has hap-
pened to the “objectivity” which is

 

 

but very solid rhythm man. His solos
are often interjected with hilarious
quotes from other songs. His rhy-
thmical approach to the bass is one
which is very congenial to the
group as a whole.

Joe Morello

Drummer Joe Morello is perhaps
the key to the musical approach
of the group today. Unquestionably
one of the finest precussionists in
the world, Morello has influenced
explorations in diversified rhythms.
His work on the recent Time Out
and Time Further Out albums has
been nothing short of magnificent.
Many of these explorations were
taken from Indian and African sour-
es. No other drummer before Morel-
lo, with the possible exception of
Max Roach, was able to play such
rhythms with a jazz conception.
Because of the addition of Morello,
the music of Dave Brubeck has been
able to grow both harmonically and
rhythmically.

When the quartet played at Wash-
ington and Lee last Saturday after-
noon, it was met with tremendous
enthusiasm. The music of the day
was wonderfully balanced and ex-
pertly performed. From the opening
bars of the St. Louis Blues to Mo-
rello’s fantistic rhythmical display
in 5/4 time at the end, the quartet
played with a jazz feeling which
had almost all feet tapping.

The musical highlights of the day

our purported ideal? The proverb
about “people in glass houses” fits
very well here. But this, of course, is
my personal reaction to that arti-
cle, and hence, subjective. It il-
lustrates how difficult it is to ach-
ieve objectivity, and also possibly,
the utter futility of trying to argue
about anything. For this reason, give
credit to all those who realize this
paradox and yet continue the at-
tempt.

Let me make one final ‘personal’

 

 

A Review: The Brubeck Quartet

in this listener’s opinion were Bru-
beck’s driving solo on the first
number, Desmond’s wonderful lyric-
ism on just about everything he
played, but especially on Sewannee
River, and of course, Morello’s ex-
citing climax to the day.

Perhaps the finest number as a
whole was Gone With the Wind.
Everyone in the group seemed to
have high regard for the song and
played it with this same regard.

Brubeck The Composer

A special note, it may be added
that Brubeck is a fine composer as
well as a tremendous musician.
Two of the pieces he played Sat-
urday were his one compositions.
One, The Duke, he wrote as special
tribute to Duke Ellington. The other
was a wonderfully lyrical ballad en-
titled In Your Own Sweet Way. It
might be said that one of the finest
jazz recordings ever made was done
by Miles Davis, on this same ballad.

For those interested in recordings
by the quartet, there are many to
choose from. Perhaps the best re-
cording done in the 50’s by the
group was Jazz At Oberlin, on the
Fantasy record label. The group
played such famous jazz classics
as Perdido and How High the Moon.
Since the group switched to the
Columbia label, they have turned
out a great number of albums. The
finest of these are probably Gone
With the Wind and the recent Time
Out and Time Further Out.

observation. I do not believe that
the professors at this university are
biased. They have opinions, but I do
not think that these opinions per-
meate their classrooms. Recently,
I heard one professor remark, “Gen-
tlemen, if you are looking for an-
swers, forget it! There are no an-
swers in this course.” And then he
went on to point out his biases. God
bless the man, and all those like
him! I think they rule the roost
here.

Dean Gilliam has said that this

There seems to be a good chance
that Ray Charles will play for
either a concert or a dance during
Spring Dances. Other possibilities
include Dave Guard, (a former
member of the Kingston Trio), Josh
White, and Charlie Byrd.

Dance Board President Steve
Galef had originally hoped to pro-
mote a folk music festival for
Spring Dances. He feels now, how-
ever, that there is not enough time
remaining to make the proper con-
tacts and preparations.

Uncas McThenia and others are
extremely interested in studying the
possibility of changes in the present
rush system. They feel that the
present system definitely has it’s
advantages, but that there are
changes that could be made which
would iron out some of the rough
edges, and improve the system as a
whole.

ritt performing in one of the old
SWMSFC minstrel shows. The pro-
fessors are clad in loud striped
blazers, boaters, and bermuda shorts.
Dr. Atwood is sporting a very dia-
bolical moustache.

One picture is worth a thousand
words, they say.

There is a good chance that the
“High Society” theme used in this
year’s Fancy Dress Ball will be
made a permanent one. The theme
is especially well-suited to the de-
cor of Evans Dining Hall. Futher,
the cost of the costumes is consid-
erably less, which improves the at-
tendance at the dance.

Rumor has it that the announce-
ment on the new history major will
be followed by the announcement
of a new sociology major. Dr. Ley-

details.

Johnny Quick
And The
American Way

By STEVE HENRY

What we would like to see around
this campus is a Johnny Quick fan
club.

Did you ask who Johnny Quick
is? Well, we'll tell you. He is the
greatest. He is Barry Goldwater,
Douglas McArthur, Teddy Roose-
velt, and John Birch, all wrapped
up in one. Wow!

When Johnny Quick acts, the
world takes notice. Take, for ex-
ample, last month when he person-
ally righted the wrongs of a Latin
American dictator who had been re-
sponsible for the hijacking of one of
Johnny’s planes. (Johnny, you see,
is no small operator).

The Butcher of Tributo

When Johnny found out that his
plane was being held on the small
island of Tributo (any similarity to
Cuba is incidental), he sent a tele-
gram to the dictator in which he
said the following: “Release the
plane, you fat butcher, or we'll hang
you for piracy!”

Well, you can guess the outcome
for yourself. The Fat Butcher (who,
incidentally, had a beard and was a
Commie), refused to release the
plane, so Johnny hopped up from
his desk, enlisted the aid of a few
commandoes, whipped down to Tri-
buto, and hanged the Fat Butcher.
Take that, you nasty old dictator!

Now there’s an example of real
Americanism. It’s like one of John-
ny’s admirers said, “You don’t often
see that kind of courage in an Am-
erican any more.”

Johnny got himself into a pretty
bad predicament in Tributo, though.
The Fat Butcher’s comrades were
relatively hacked off, and were clos-
ing in on Johnny for the kill.

Enter Daddy Warbucks

But, then, but then, but then!
Along came THE man Daddy War-
bucks. (Darn it, you’ve guessed it.
We're talking about a comic strip.)

Daddy Warbucks whisked Johnny
away without a scratch. They ended
up at Big Daddy’s secret hideaway,
and in the process managed to sink
an atomic Russian trawler that was
intent on ending their illustrious
careers.

Their troubles weren’t over, even
at Daddy’s pad. Not by a long shot.
Those nasty old whatevertheyweres
still wanted revenge, and dropped
200 crack parachuters down to put
the quietus on Johnny and Daddy.

It took OUR boys about two days
to wipe out the 200 parachuters, an-
other example of the obvious su-
periority of the Western mind.

Oh, this really made those other
people mad. They decided to wipe
up the entire island with an H-
bomb. Guess what! Big Daddy had a
ray gun stashed away in some dark
corner, with which he shot down the
foreign planes carrying the bombs.
WHOOM! The bombs went off, right
in the middle of a Russian ship. End
of bad guys, hooray for good guys!

Deus Ex Machina?

The last time we looked, Johnny,
Daddy, and Annie were standing
around, commenting on how tense
things had been. Every once in a
while, someone would throw in one
of those priceless little pearls of
wisdom like, “That just shows you
that nothing can beat good old
Yankee ingenuity.” (After all, ev-
ery Yank has a ray gun in his
house.) Or, “True Americans aren’t
afraid to act.” (Rise, W&L, to Cuba.
We'll hang old Fidel in the morn-
ing.)

But, halt. Before we go, perhaps
we need a little organization. That’s
why we need a Johnny Quick Fan
Club. Every other organization on
campus gets members without even
trying. It’s only logical that some-
thing really worthwhile like the
JQFC could attract throngs.

Would some responsible leader,
who worships the ground that John-
ny and Warbucks walk on, and be-
lieves in everything they advocate,
get to work on the student body?

It could be the greatest.

One final warning, though. Don’t
get indoctrinated in the process.
Join the JQFC because you feel it
in your heart, not because someone
tells you it might be the nice thing
to do. Please?

Editor’s Note:

This is typical of the type of sub-
versive propaganda that is flooding
our American college campuses. We
are surprised that it came from
Washington and Lee and not from
some hotbed of liberalism like Har-
vard or the Patrice Lumumba Uni-
versity in Moscow. Any way you
look at it, the obvious point is
that the current scare about com-
symps is real. Fellow-travellers are

Fauber Leads
In Rebounds,
Total Points

Captain Rodger Fauber leads
Washington and Lee’s basketball
team in scoring, rebounding, and

foul shooting, according to statis-
tics released today.

Through ten games, which saw
the Generals compile a 4-6 over-
all record, Fauber has collected a
team-leading 143 points, a 14.3 per
game average.

He’s also made 41 out of 51 free
throws for an 80.4 percentage, and
has pulled down 174 rebounds for a
17.4 per game average.

Fauber’s field goal percentage is
a creditable 40.5 per cent, but is only
the third best on the team.

Tom Supak, hitting at a 44.7 per
cent clip, leads the Generals in that
area. Freshman guard Louie Paterno
is second with 41 per cent.

Paterno leads the Generals in foul
shooting percentage, having made
29 out of 35 for an 82.8 percentage.

Supak and Paterno are the only
Generals besides Fauber averaging
in double figures for the year. Supak
has a 12.7 per game average, and
Paterno has 12.5 per game.

In rebounding, Bill Ide is second
to Fauber with a 7.9 per game av-
eragfie. Bill Smith is third in this
important area with 6.1 rebounds
per game.

Ide is averaging nine points a
game, and Smith 4.4.

Individual highs for the year are
as follows:

Total points: Fauber, 31, against
Franklin and Marshall.

Field goals; Tom Supak,
against Lynchburg.

Free throws: Fauber, 11 for 13
against Franklin and Marshall.

Rebounds: Fauber, 28, against
Norfolk William and Mary.

Team highs for the year:

Field goals: 30 against Franklin
and Marshall.

Free throws attempted: 36 against
Norfolk William and Mary.

Free throws made: 26 against
Franklin and Marshall.

Personal fouls: 24 against Franklin
and Marshall.

For the year the Generals are
shooting at a 36 per cent clip, while
opponents are getting 38 per cent
of their field goal attempts down.

W&L is averaging 65.2 points per
game, and opponents are averag-
ing 68.0.

Thackston, Rutledge Ready

For the first time this year, both
Brett Thackston and Steve Rutledge
will be available for action.

Thackston, ineligible until second
semester this year, has been work-
ing out with the varsity since Fancy
Dress, and will see considerable
action Saturday.

Rutledge, out with injuries for
most of the first semester, saw
limited action against Norfolk Wil-
liam and Mary, but has rounded
into shape since then and will be
ready to go Saturday.

Both Thackston and Rutledge were
starters last year.

Cagers Ready For Tigers;

Play In Gym

Saturday

Washington and Lee’s basketball team launches a stretch
drive for its first .500 season in six years Saturday night against

Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers.

The Generals, who posted a 4-6*
mark in the first half of the season,
return to action after a three-week
layofl with a strong possibility of
turning in a .500 season.

“But we have to win our next
two home games (Hampden-Sydney
and Roanoke next Wednesday),”
Coach Bob McHenry cautions.

Hampden-Sydney, the number
two team in Virginia’s little Eight
offers a formidable stumbling block
in the Generals’ path to their .500
goal. The Tigers decisioned W&L,
717-66, at Hampden-Sydney January
9 despite the fact that the Generals
played one of their best games of
the year, according to McHenry.

The main reason that Washington
and Lee lost was a 6-2 forward
named Bill Hardin. Hardin, the
state’s leading scorer, poured in 32
points as he paced the Tiger attack.

McHenry already has_ several
good-working defenses, but he is
adding a special one for the Hamp-
den-Sydney game.

“I just hope we can play the kind
of defense we played against Nor-

 

folk William and Mary in our last
game,” the coach said. “They came
into the game with a 7-2 record and
we put the pressure on them. Con-
sequently, they hit only 15 per cent
from the floor the first half.

“They weren't off, either. Our
defense stopped them. In the sec-
ond half they hit 40 per cent but
that was because our boys got
tired.” McHenry said.

WAL, which built up a 32-18 half-
time lead, defeated the Monarchs,
71-58.

Defense has been the key to
W&L’s limited success so far this
season, and surprisingly enough, the
key to the W&L defense has been
freshman guard Louie Paterno.

“Paterno really made our defense
work against Norkolk,’ McHenry
said.

Paterno along with captain Rodger
Fauber and guard Tom Supak carry
the brunt of the W&L offensive at-
tack. All three are averaging over 12
points per game.

Generals Ready To Begin Spring
Football Practice This Monday

 

Hickey, Essex
Competing In
Enquirer Meet

Washington and Lee
Jim Hickey and Skip Essex left
yesterday for Philadelphia where
they will compete in the Enquirer
Games today.

Hickey, the state 100-yard cham-
pion, will run in the 50-yard sprint
in Philadelphia. Essex will enter the
1000-yard run.

In the VMI relays last week,
Hickey won his heat in the 60-yard
dash, but finished an overall fifth
behind runners from Navy, Mary-
land, and North Carolina.

trackmen

Shuttle Run

Washington and Lee entered only
one other event besides the 60-yard
dash, and that was the Sprint Shut-
tle Relay.

A General team composed of
Chris Kell, Hickey, John Pearson
and Jordan Smith placed sixth in
the relay.

W&L track coach Norm Lord said
he was “well pleased” with his en-
trants’ performances in the relays,
and is “looking forward to another
successful track season this spring.”

Next week, Coach Lord will take
his indoor trackmen back to VMI
for the Virginia State Indoor Track
meet.

 

Peter Winnfield Takes
Starting Wrestling Role

Peter Winnfield, a second semes-
ter freshman, has won a starting
position on the Washington and Lee
wrestling team for the Duke match
tomorrow at 3 p.m.

Winnfield defeated Chick Owens in
a challenge match Wednesday, 5-1.

Another freshman, Charlie Dick-
inson, will take over in the 130-
opund class against Duke for co-
captain Dave Montgomtry, who sus-
tained a serious foot injury over
Fancy Dress week-end and is in-
definitely sidelined.

Bo Jones ,who usually wrestles
behind Montgomery in the 130-
pound division, is still out of action
with a broken ankle.

Spring football practice at Washington and Lee gets un-
derway Monday, with 31 lettermen from last year’s undefeated

team expected to return.

For the last three years, spring*
practice has been sharply curtailed
by snow and ice, but head coach
Lee McLaughlin is hoping the
weather man will give him a break
this year.

“We need more pleasant weather
just so we can see better what we’ve
got,” he said.

On paper, McLaughlin hasn't
really got too much to worry about.
In addition to the 31 returnees,
which include standouts Bob Payne,
Charlie Gummey, Tommy Keesee,
and Chuck Lane, there’ll be 25 fresh-
men on hand to add depth to the
squad.

 

Golfers Will Begin Spring
Practice Meets on March 1

Washington and Lee’s golf team
will begin organized practice on
March 1 in preparation for the
spring season, it was announced to-
day by golf coach E. P. (Cy) Twom-
bly.

Six lettermen return from last
year’s squad that posted a 7-2 sea-
son’s record, and placed fourth in
the state tournament at Hot Springs.

Two four-year lettermen, Captain
Grantham Couch and former state
collegiate champion Jack Varda-
man lead the returnees, who also in-
clude Will Lee, Ron Stewart, War-
ren Hughes, and Steve Henry.

Coach Twombly has added two
more men, juniors Paul McBride
and Bill Wyly, to his squad, making
a total of eight men on the team.
Six men play in each match.

McLaughlin himself admitted that
things should be good around Wil-
son Field this year.

“We've lost 18 fine football play-
ers, he said. “But we’re expecting
the sophomore and juniors to come
through for us. If our returning
boys accept their responsibility
we’re not very anxious about next
year.”

One a Day

McLaughlin has scheduled two
weeks of spring practice, with one
session on tap every day.

Practice will begin daily at 4
p.m., and wrap up around 5:30.
Equipment will be issued at 3 p.m.
Monday.

At the end of the two week
period, there will be an Alumni-
Intersquad game, scheduled for Sat-
urday, February 24. Former W&L
stars Courtney Mauzy and Bob
Funkhouser have already planned
to suit up for the game, and other
interested alumni are being con-
tacted.

Here’s a breakdown of how
many players should return at each
position this spring:

Left end, three.

Left tackle, three.

Left guard, two.

Center, two.

Right guard, two.

Right tackle, three.

Right end, two.

Left half, four.

Fullback, three.

Quarterback, four.

How The Ring-tum Phi Got Its Name

The name “Ring-tum Phi” sounds
more like a yell than the name of a
college paper, it should because it is.

Back in 1897, one of the Generals’
yells went like this:

Ring-tum Phi
Stickeri bun
We're hot stuff
From Lexington
Rah, Rah, Rah!
White and Blue
Whoopla, whoopla!
W.L.U.

Not only was that a college yell
back in 1897, but it was the only one
Washington and Lee had.

So, naturally or not, when J. Sam
Slicer and Gordon R. Houston
founded the paper in that year they
chose the name Ring-tum Phi. It
was also picked to signify “The
Voice of the Student Body.”

The two Ring-tum Phi founders
had few financial troubles in that

 

day and time. Advertisements were

plentiful. Local merchants found
their ads well-read because the edi-
tors slipped in such little gems of
fact as this one:

A Little Gem

“Found—in front of Dr. Howe’s,
shoe, number 3!%. Having a long
tongue it is supposed to be of fem-
inine gender.—R.E.L.”

The “Ring-tum Phi” yell was
discarded in 1900 but the newspaper
has continued under that name until
the present.

The fourteenth issue of the Ring-
tum Phi was published on Saturday
January 15, 1898. The Southern Col-
legian had already been established
for the lead article in the paper
described the articles in the forth-
coming issue of the Collegian.

A news story on the third page
of this issue of the paper is head-
lined “Miss Carmichael’s Dancing
Class Closes with a Flourish.” The
article goes to say:

 

49 Listed On Honor Roll

Forty-nine students made Honor
Roll grades for the first semester of
the 1961-62 school year, including
eight freshmen. Eight students made
a perfect 3.0 grande-point ratio.

These figures may be compared to
the figures for the first semester of
the 1960-61 school year. At that
time, fifty-eight students were on
the Honor Roll, including nine
freshmen and nine students with
3.0 averages.

“Saturday evening, Dec. 11, the
most brilliant evening of the sea-
son took place when Miss Carmich-
ael gave her last lesson in the danc-
ing hall on Randolph Street. The
rooms were tastefully decorated
with cut flowers and growing plants.
At 8 o’clock Miss Anderson took her
place at the piano, and to the inspir-
ing strains of “Drunk Last Night,”
the class entered the room led by
Miss Laura Tucker. The young la-
dies were in fancy dress, represent-
ing flowers.”

 

Houses Abolish Hell Week

(Continued from page 1)

ish Hell Week, Doenges said that he
felt a great change was innovated
this year, and that even greater
modification would come next year

Dr. Louis Hodges, Asst. Profes-
sor of Religion, spoke from a facul-
ty viewpoint: The administration
will probably crack down on Hell
Week unless fraternities substitute
a more constructive program for the
traditional pledge abuse.

Mr. William Chaffin, speech in-
structor, noted: Hell Week has
no place on the campus of a modern
university.

 

J. T. Russell, Librarian

J. Thomas Russell has resigned as
Washington and Lee’s Public Serv-
ices Librarian to accept a position
at the Naval Weapons Laboratory at
Dahlgren.

A member of the McCormick Li-
brary staff here since 1959, Russell
will become Reader Services Li-
brarian at the Naval Installation
near Fredericksburg.

Russell’s successor has not been
named to date, Henry E. Coleman,
university librarian, said.

He received his bachelor of arts
degree in 1957 from Kenyon Col-
lege and his master of arts degree
in 1959 from the University of
Michigan. He also attended the Uni-
versity of Maryland.

Russell, 26, served as assistant to
the cataloguer at the Navy’s David
Taylor Model Basin, Carderock,
Md., in 1958. He taught public school
in Leesburg in 1957. He is a native
of Washington, D.C.

Warbucks, Si!

(Continued from page 2)

no illusion, friends.

Just as the Communists are try-
ing to destroy the House Un-Amer-
ican Activities Committee by calling
for their civil rights as Americans
under the Fifth Amendment, the au-
thor of this little bit of subversion
and hand-biting has chosen to at-
tack one of our most venerable and
respected free institutions—Daddy
Warbucks. He would feel that War-
bucks is not a great hero but rather
a despised capitalist and enemy of
the working gclasses, an imperialist
who no doubt has ties with a Fas-
cist organization like the OAS.

We also get the impression that
the Fat Butcher is not a cowering
slob but a_ bright-eyed idealist.
Really now!

What we need in the United
States is a johnny Quick-Daddy
Warbucks fan club. He, like
Barry Goldwater and Douglas Mac-
Arthur, typifies the great Ameri-
can virtues of Resourcefulness,
Patriotism and Love of the Land
that we so desperately need in this
modern age. Rise, up Real Ameri-
cans, rally behind the Star-Span-
gled Banner, and smite down those
scoffers at our Free Way of Life.

period, he was asked if U.S. recog-
nition of Red China would effect
the stability of the nations of South-
east Asia. He answered that the an-
awer is probably “yes,” but he
quickly added, “Circumstances
would change so much by the time
we did this that my opinion now
would prove practically worthless.”
