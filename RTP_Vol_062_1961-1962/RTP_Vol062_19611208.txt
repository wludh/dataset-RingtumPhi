EC Voting
Records Will
Be Made Public

Student Questions Sought;
Meetings Now On Mon.

By MALCOLM MORRIS

The executive Committee in its
Tuesday meeting passed a _ prece-
dent-setting resolution which will
make public voting records of its
members in the future.

By a unanimous vote, the EC
provided for a chart showing the
proposals and vote of each of its
members at all regular meetings.
This chart will be published in the
Ring-tum Phi and would replace
any publication of the minutes of
EC meetings.

The EC also resolved by a 9-2
vote to include in this resolution the
clause that the chart shall be pre-
sented openly with specific purport
to press representatives after the
adjournment of each meeting.

 

 

A short question and answer per-
iod will follow for any adamant
criticism or questions presented
from those outside or on the com-
mittee.

Student Body Secretary Steve
Suttle noted that this is the first
time students will know the voting
records of their own represen-
tatives, and that interested stu-
dent, now will have a chance to
question the EC and criticise its
actions before it.

The question and answer period
will correspond to a press confer-
ence with newspaper writers. Suttle
expressed the hope of the EC that
the student body will take advant-
age of the opportunity to become
acquainted with their government.
This step should also reduce criti-
cism of the committee.

In a third motion under the reso-
lution the EC moved its meeting
date from Tuesday to Monday night.
This will allow the actions of the
EC to be publicized in the Rt-P the
next day, whereas in the past
news has been held for 3 days be-
fore being released.

In its next meeting, Monday,
Dec. 12, the EC will make its final
choices of the new Student Con-
trol Committee members. Suttle
reported that an average of 12 ap-
plications were received from
each class, making a total of well
over 40 applicants. These have
been screened by the committee
and reduced to 5 seniors, 3 juniors,
3 sophomores, and 2 law students.

 

 

Notice

One of a series of Cold War
study films, “Communist Encircle-
ment—1961,” will be screened in
in the Journalism Lecture Room,
Payne 6, at 11:10 am. Saturday,
Dec. 9. Interested students may
attend,

 

 

 

Si Zenter and his orchestra will be here for Fancy Dress.

 

Deans, Faculty On Road;
Visit Secondary Schools

By SHANNON JUNG

Dean of Admission Frank J. Gil-
liam has done extensive traveling
this fall. The purpose of his far-
reaching itinerary is to bring Wash-
ington and Lee to the attention of
college-bound students.

He has had impressive results,
for he said yesterday that the pres-
ent demand for W&L catalogues
indicates that the university is re-
ceiving increased interest and will
receive a record number of appli-
cations this year.

Washington and Lee has founded
as extensive a program of school vis-
itation as its administrative office
permits. Its aim is to reach a reason-
able proportion of schools which
are now sending us a number of
candidates each year.

In addition to this, the administra-
tion tries to add visits to a few
recognized good schools with which
there has not been much. inter-
change.

Dean Gilliam, in order to realize
these aims, has traveled in the New
England area, visiting Exeter, And-
over, St. Paul’s in New Hampshire,
Deerfield, Loomis, and Lawrence-
ville. This year Lawrenceville sent
W&L eight freshmen— the largest
number from any school.

Dean Gilliam’s trip to eastern Vir-
ginia included St. Christopher’s,
Christchurch, and Norfolk Academy
among the private schools. The pub-
lic schools of Norfolk, Newport
News, Warwick, and Hampton par-
ticipated jointly in College Nights at
which the Dean Spoke.

His most recent trip took him to
Cincinnati, Louisville, Memphis, and
St. Louis.

Dean Farrar has also been busy,
having covered the schools in the
Washington area and speaking at
several College Nights in that area.
This week, he has been at Darling-
ton, Indian Springs, Bolles, and
Westminister in Atlanta and public
high schools in Atlanta, Birmingham,

 

‘class. This presages the possibility

and Jacksonville. He has been visit-
ing Woodberry Forest today.

A new program of visitation has
been rather extensively developed
recently—that of having members of
the faculty visit high schools. Among
those members of the faculty par-
ticipating are Borden, Fishwick,
Hamer, Stephenson, Moore, Gunn,
and Rowe.

These programs are proving pro-
ductive, since the present necessity
for conserving catalogues reveals
that the number of applications has
increased with the booming interest
in W&L. The present 1:4 ratio of
candidates for acceptance enrolling
here (319 enrolled from 1252 candi-
dates) may shoot up to 1:6 or 1:7.
Next year there will be approxi-
mately 330 men in the freshman

of having the staggering number
of 2,000 candidates for matriculation.
This means a higher academic stand-
ing resulting from more selective
enrollment. The visitation program
has at least in part caused this im-
provement.

The object of the program is to
inform both high school students and
school officials about W&L. Dean
Gilliam noted an enthusiastic and
happy reaction in these schools over
the article in Sports Illustrated about
the athletic program. More import-
ant that that, Dean Gilliam stated:

“The high regard of W&L held by
every institution visited was most
impressive.”

 

Registration

Each student (except in the Law
School) is required to pick up his
course list for next semester be-
tween 2:00 p.m., Tuesday, Decem-
ber 12, 1961 and 3:30 p.m., Friday,
December 15, 1961 at the Regis-

IFC Approves ’62 FD Proposals;
Zentner To Play Saturday Night

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Si Zentner and his seventeen piece
dance band have been contracted to
entertain the student body during
the Saturday night dance of Fancy
Dress, Dance Board president Steve
Galef announced today.

He also said that the hours for
the dance will be 8:00 until 11:00
and that the required dress will be
conservative suits rather than tuxes.

“Zentner is one of the top trom-
bonists in show business, and has a
solid background of band experience
with such all-time greats as Les
Brown, Harry James and the late
Jimmy Dorsey,” Galef said. He is a
recording artist for Liberty Records
and has considerable experience in
orchestration for films.

 

Galef said that the chief reason
for contracting Zentner is the popu-
larity of his recent recording “Up
a Lazy River,” which is nationally
among the top fifty.

Zentner is a relative newcomer
to the field of dance entertainment,
however. After his initial appearance
on the West Coast, he was contract-
ed to perform at the Roosevelt Ho-
tel. There he was so well received
that his option was extended to in-
clude the period of the Thanksgiv-
ing vacation. His scheduled per-
formance at Washington and Lee
during Fancy Dress will mark his
first professional appearance in the
South with his band.

Usually the Saturday night dance
has been held between the hours of

Jim Hitch and Bill Moore
Attend Conference On US
Military Affairs

Two students from Washington
and Lee are attending the annual
Student Conference on United States
Affairs at the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point this week. Jim Hitch
and Bill Moore are representing
W&L at the conference, which
started Wednesday and ends to-
morrow.

The conference featured an open-
ing address by John J. McCloy for-
mer United States High Commis-
sioner in Germany, who is remem-
bered here for delivering the 1958
Tucker lectures at W&L.

Representatives of about a hun-
dred colleges in the United States
and Canada are attending the four-
day conference, whose theme is the
European community and its impli-
cations for U.S. Policy.

Hitch is a transfer student from
New Mexico Military Institute,
where he was a distinguished mili- |
tary graduate. A dean’s list student
and holder of a Lee Research Schol-
arship, he plans a career in the
regular army upon graduation.

Moore, a Phi Beta Kappa gradu-
ate in history at Sewanee, is a Law
School senior. Presently an appli-
cant for a commisison in the Judge
Advocate’s Department of the U.S.
Navy, he plans to practice law after
graduation, specializing in labor law.

 

Pressing Service

The Student War Memorial
Scholarship Fund Committee will
offer a pressing service to all stu-
dents renting Fancy Dress cos-
tumes. The service will include
handling and delivery.

 

uary 4, 1962 and January 5, 1962.

 

There will be a $1.00 charge.

 

* The former president of Hampden-

Sydney College will be the keynote
speaker at noon Tuesday for the
annual Omicron Delta Kappa “tap
day” ceremony.

Dr. Joseph C. Robert, currently
professor of history at the Univer-
sity of Richmond, will speak to some
1,300 faculty members, students and
guests at the university at noon in
Doremus Gymnasium. The assembly
will mark the 47th annual tapping
of outstanding students, faculty and
alumni for membership in the na-
tional honorary leadership frater-
nity.

Rosewell Page, a senior from
Beaver Dam and current president of
Alpha Circle of ODK, will preside
at the assembly.

An undisclosed number of new
members will be given surprise
taps for membership at the close of
the session. A luncheon for new and
old members will follow in Wash-
ington and Lee’s Evans Dining Hall.

Dr. Robert, who resigned the pres-
idency of Hampden-Sydney in June,
1960, became professor of history at
Richmond this September. He spent
last year on a Ford Foundation
travel grant studying American and
European universities.

 

Chessmen Meet Roanoke

Washington and Lee’s chess team
dropped a 3-2 match to a Roanoke
team in Roanoke last Friday night.
W&L’s winners were Ronnie Moore,
second board, who defeated Leonard
Morgan, a former Virginia state
champion; and Bill Gray, third
board, who defeated A. C. Abbott of
Roanoke.

The losers for W&L were Lon
Atkins, first board, who lost to Wal-
ter Muir, the nation’s six-ranked
postal player; Franco deBattaglia,
fourth board; and Jack Martin, who
lost to Nelson Bond, Roanoke city
champion for nine years.

 

9 and 12 p.m. Galef explained to
the members of the Dance Board
and the Social Chairmen of the
eighteen fraternities that the re-
scheduling to the new hours was a
faculty concession designed to in-
crease student attendance at the
dance and to enable the fraternities
to hold combo parties that would
not conflict as much as usual with
the school dance.

The decision to require only suits
rather than tuxedos at the Saturday
dance is also designed to increase
attendance at the dance.

Galef reminded the social chair-
men that the faculty has the power
either to do away with the Uni-
versity Dance Weekends or to ban
fraternity parties that would inter-
fere with attendance at the school
functions.

Three resolutions were then passed
by the chairmen with unanimous
votes. The resolutions are: (1) No
further contracts will be made con-
cerning Fancy Dress combos on
Saturday afternoon between the
hours of 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. (2) Fra-
ternities will not start combos on
Fancy Dress Weekend 1962 before
9:30 p.m.. (3) Fraternities are aware
of the problems that exist and are
willing to work for a compromise
to solve these problems.

The chairmen are returning to the
houses to discuss these problems
and solutions.

Auditions For
‘Othello’ Held

The final session of auditions for
the Troubadour Theatre’s production
of Shakespeare’s Othello will take
place at the Troub Theatre tonight
from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Readings are
open to all students whether they
have acted here previously or not.

 

Anyone who wishes to try for a
role but is unable to attend the
scheduled auditions may contact Dr.
Cecil Jones, Troubadour director,
and arrange for a private reading
over the wekend.

There are twenty-two male roles
in the acting version of the tragedy
as it will be presented. Seventeen of
these are speaking roles. Dr. Jones
noted that several of these are small
parts requiring only a_ limited
amount of rehearsal.

Full rehearsals for Othello will not
get underway until the start of the
second semester. The cast is being
selected at this time, however, in
order to allow those persons who
will play the six major roles to
have individual coaching on their
parts prior to the beginning of their
work with the rest of the company.
Dr. Jones emphasized that no work
on the show would conflict in any
way with a student’s work at the
end of this semester.

 

Dr. Louis B. Wright Discusses The Bard

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Last night Dr. Louis B. Wright,
a noted scholar in the related fields
of English and history, spoke at 8:15
in Lee Chapel on “Shakespeare for
the Layman.”

The director of the Folger Shake-
speare Library in Washington, Dr.
Wright was introduced by Dr. Fitz-
gerald Flournoy as “a citizen of
the world.”

“What he hasn’t written, he has
edited,” said Dr. Flournoy,

Dr. Wright was instrumental in the
deciphering and publication of the
private diary of William Byrd; and
he later accounted for the “sudden”
flowering of political and military
leadership in Virginia during the
period of the American Revolution

in his book The First Virginia
Gentlemen.
One of his most popular edited
works is The General Reader’s
Shakespeare.

“Shakespeare is not just a person
who is a favorite of professors,”
said Dr. Wright in his introductory
remarks. “Indeed, I am constantly
amazed at the interest the layman
has in Shakespeare.” He then told
of his amusing experience in a
crowded theater in London. He had

 

bought the very last ticket available
for a performance of Love’s Labors’
Lost and was seated next to a wage
earner in the five penny section. At
one point in the play ,the man
nudged him and chuckled, “That’s a
good un!”

Seventy-four Translations

Dr. Wright first mentioned Shake-
spear’s lasting and widespread popu-
larity. “Only the Bible,” he said, “is
available in more languages than
Shakespeare.” Shakespeare is read
in seventy-four languages and his
plays appear on the stages and in
the movies of many nations. “On
both sides of the Iron Curtain,
Shakespeare apparently has admir-
ers; he is one writer who seems to
be above the issues of politics.”

In discussing Shakespeare’s uni-
versal appeal, Dr. Wright mentioned
the case of one lady “who wrote a
pamphlet on ‘Shakespeare’s Crows,
because she liked crows and found
them mentioned in the plays.”

The anti-Shakespeare movement |
has attempted to bastardize the bard |
by assigning his works to the pen
of such miscellaneous people as
Marlowe, the Earl of Hartford, a|

syndicate headed by Ben Johnson, !

 

Bacon, or even Queen Elizabeth. |
But to date they have produced no!

® : : |
scrop of reliable evidence to disprove |

Shakespeare's authorship, and have |
only succeeded in proving his popu- |
larity.

Dr. Wright remarked that “it has |
been estimated that one fifth of the |
people in British lunatic asylums |
have delusions about the validity |
of Shakespeare.”

“Conspiracy of Schoolteachers” |

The reasons for Shakespeare’s |
popularity are varied. Some main-|
tain that he is kept alive by a “con-|
spiracy of schoolteachers.” Perhaps
Dr. Wright suggested, “he has sur-

vived in spite of scholars.” Shakes-
peare did not write for a congnos-
centi, or small, selected group, but
for everyman. He wrote “with an

eye to the box office.” He sought to
interest as many as he could, so
they would attend the performance
of his company. He wrote with
genius on themes of universal in-
terest and importance.

His genius is manifested in his
close observation of the world, his
transmutation of words into beauty |
his sympathic understanding of hu-
man nature, and his instinctive eapa-
city to seek the elements for his!

| perienced and what we

plays where he could best get them:
in full experience in life and in
conversation with his fellows.

“His powers of assimilation were
enormous, and this capacity was evi-
dence of genius, not of booklearn-
ing,” continue Dr. Wright. “His char-
acters seem to live and breath as
men and women; he gives them life.
The appeal of Shakespeare is to our
humanity; and it is universal, inde-
pendent of time and space, for he
expresses both what we have ex-
know we
could experience.

 

“No translation, however good,

can capture the music and evocative |

power of Shakespeare; hence he has |

a powerful appeal to the English |
speaking world which cannot be|
readily comprehended by others.
“Shakespeare writes with ease and
grace; he uses simple words and}
never twists them to fit a rhyme or |
meter; his figures are from life, not
the classics. There is nothing artifi-

cial or contrived about Shakespeare.”

Through his works “we receive
instruction and experience delight;
and this combination is the highest
achievement of any writer.” |

Dr. Wright and Dr. Flournoy discuss Shakespeare.

A Word On Athletes

We understand that the basketball team and some mem-
bers of the coaching staff are unhappy about Steve Henry’s
article in last Friday’s R-tP. We would like to be able to tell
them to take some justly deserved criticism like the men they
think they are. But we can’t because we are afraid that they
are guilty of a tragic misconception which is prevalent through-

out the United States.

Somehow the American sportwriters have convinced the
public that athletes are a breed apart, some race that is superior
to non-athletes in every respect. They are not, they are men

just like all men.

Some athletes are very intelligent, but some are very stupid.
Some are very good athletes, but some are no good at all. Some
take bribes. Others cheat (as we at W&L know to our sorrow).
Some play harder than others. Some are gentlemen, many are

not.

We don’t know why the basketball team thinks they are
above criticism. They loaf sometimes. They make mistakes
often. They also play very well at times. We think it is the
responsibility of the Ring-tum Phi to tell its readers what the
truth is, to the best of our ability. Steve Henry is not a great
sports writer. But he is a sports writer who is not afraid to say
what he thinks. He will continue to say what he thinks and the
Ring-tum Phi will continue to print what he thinks.

Fancy Dress Trial

The announcement today of the band for Saturday night
of Fancy Dress completes the Dance Board’s booking for the
big weekend. Steve Galef and Frank Young have worked very
hard to give the student body the best entertainers they can

get for the dance weekends.

This Fancy Dress should be among the best of recent
years. We will be curious to see the sort of attendance the big
dances will have. If attendance is poor, it should convince the
powers-that-be that the present formula for dance weekends
needs changing, to give dance plan subscribers their money’s

worth.

 

PROTEST ‘Soap Operas’ Reveal

Need For Honor

By HOWARD SLATER

How is the term “honor” applied,
within the framework of the honor
system?

This is the vital question which
still plagues us; because contrary to
the belief of many, Dr. Coulling’s
recent article on the honor system
did not solve the problem, or even
try to. What it did was create a
more conscious appreciation of why
we ought to have such a system,
and it also stated what “honor” is,
what it includes, and what limits
there are to the exactness of this
description.

But when Dr. Coulling used the
term “application,” he was referring
only to “the area covered by the
honor system.” This really is a part
of his definition of honor. The actual
application of the honor system is
the enforcement of a code of honor,
and the punishment of trangessions
on this code.

If we accept Dr. Coulling’s defini-
tion of honor—and everyone seems
to be more or less agreed that it
is the best definition we can expect—
we are then, nevertheless, still con-
fronted by the need to apply this
definition in the framework of a
functioning honor system. How is
the code of honor enforced? More
important, how are trangressions on
this code punished?

Past Answer Unsatisfactory

The answer that has been given
in the past—the answer, that is
which has been implied by the actual
practices of the system—has been
that any violation of the honor sys-
tem requires the violator’s expul-
sion from school.

This ought to be an unsatisfactory
answer for anyone who wants to
claim sensitivity and humanity as
part of his personal attributes. By
dismissing as soap operas the case
histories of past expellees which
Protest has been printing recently,
we ignore a very real poignancy in
these examples, a poignancy which
has meaning for us all. If nothing
else, it is clear that a selfish identi-
fication can establish a relation be-
tween us and those “guilty” ones.

These are, after all, human beings,
with feelings like our own—and with
aspirations and ambitions, similar
to ours, whose achievement now are
impossibly or tragically altered by
the workings of the honor system.

The point, of course, is that we
cannot abstract the human ele-
ment out of the honor system.
This element both operates and
is operated on by the system.
When we start to make the funda-

 

System Leniency

mental distinction between honest
and dishonest men, we cannot fail
to remember that we are still
dealing with men. Thus, the pro-
cess of the honor system is weight-
ed by the gravity of its repercus-
sions,
Leniency Needed

In this dilemma, the inevitable
conclusion is for us to prefer that
the honor system be lenient in pun-
ishing trangessions. It would be far
better if ten men who cheated on
exams got away with it, than if
one who didn’t cheat were mistaken-
ly expelled from school.

The practical solution to this pref-
erence for leniency would be recog-
nition that there are differing de-
grees of guilt. A man may be guilty
of violating the code of honor, but
he may be less guilty than he could
have been. Like Dr. Coulling, I do
not feel semantically naive when I
say it is difficult to define exactly
what is meant by “degrees of guilt”
in the honor system. Conditions and
requirements make it difficult to give
examples. But the lack of sinister
intent would make a man “less
guilty’—although it can be argued
that the logical conclusion for this
is that there can be no guilt at all,
unless there is the intent to be dis-
honest.

In the end, the burden of the
gravity of the honor system, and the
problem of balancing leniency with
punishment, both fall on the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee.
They must apply the code of honor.

Opposing Argument

The only argument of any valid-
ity that can be opposed to the
existence of an honor system is
that those who administer it are
only students, who tend to bend
over backwards and be too harsh
in their judgments. That this is
the best argument against an hon-
or system is testimony to how
fine a thing the honor system is.

For as the harshness of the judi-
cial group lessens, so too does the
strength of the criticism lessen.

By STEVE HENRY

In the Spring of 1961, an event
of considerable significance took
place on the Washington and Lee
campus when the first issue of the
student literary magazine PROBES
was placed on sale.

PROBES, a magazine for the stu-
dents, containing short stories, crit-
ical essays, and poetry by the stu-
dents, was the brainchild of a
thoughtful Phi Beta Kappa named
Tony Gray, who was also the pro-
genitor of the  once-formidable
weekly journal Protest.

Gray, an admittedly angry, angry
young man, who often took out his
anger on Washington and Lee, cre-
ated PROBES because “any school,
even W&L, needs a student literary
magazine.”

To Gray, the idea of Washington
and Lee not having such a publica-
tion was ridiculously in keeping
with other anti-intellectual charac-
teristics of the school (which, we
might add, are coming more to the
front each day.)

Response to the first issue of
Probes was good enough to show
Gray that a student literary outlet
was not only needed, but also
wanted by the student body.

This, of course, came as no sur-
prise to Gray, who knew all the
time that even a uninspired student
body like we have here has oc-
casional twinges of literary creativ-
ity.

As everybody knows, boys will be
boys, and students will write, pro-
vided that there’s a chance for pub-
lication in a magazine of any size,
shape or description.

PROBES opened the door to any-
body who was willing to take time
to write, and it was about time.

Lack of Encouragement

For years, Washington and Lee
was one of the few “prestige”(?)
schools in America that provided no
encouragement for its student body’s
potential writers.

When was the last time you ever
heard of a prominent author (or
critic, or anything) who picked up
his sheepskin at good old W&L?
Think hard now.

While neighboring schools like
Randolph-Macon, Sweet Briar, Hol-
lins, and even William and Mary
were turning out readable student
publications, W&L was concentrat-
ing on the development of its most
prominent publication Shenandoah.

We are happy that the Shenandoah
is a first class magazine. Some ex-
ceptionally fine work has appeared
in its pages, and by some of the
most prominent authors in America.

However, with the exception of an
occasional student contribution,
Shenandoah does nothing for the
Washington and Lee student body.
Whether this is good or bad is an-

PROBES Closes Breach
In Campus Literary Life

What we are saying is that, until
the advent of PROBES, a young
writer at W&L wrote for his own
benefit and for nothing else, which
is hardly encouraging.

But why rant and rave over a
problem that’s been solved? There
are plenty of other things around
here to gripe about. (Just check out
Protest if you don’t believe us.)

Anyway, PROBES is here, and it
is a good thing for everybody.

Alenstein

Gray, who took his diploma and
left Washington and Lee last year
(presumably forever), turned over
the reins of PROBES to Ron Alen-
stein, a ZBT senior who will edit
both of the proposed issues of the
magazine this year.

Alenstein, who won a 1961 junior
Mahan award for creative writing,
is presently collecting manuscripts
for the first issue of PROBES, sched-
uled for a late January release.

Contributions thus far have been
gratifying. A generous supply of
fiction is on hand already, along
with a few poems of publishable
quality. Critical work, however, is
lacking.

Alenstein says that this year’s
PROBES will contain some 35-40
pages, including several pages de-
voted to art work which will ac-
company selections in the magazine.

Deadline for submitting manu-
scripts is December 15.

essays,” says Alenstein, who spends

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Time in the contemporary novel
is not what it once was.

Ulysses, the lengthy novel by
James Joyce, covers the occurences
of the day. Another Joycean tale,
Finnegan’s Wake, begins and ends on
the same night.

What is the attempt of authors
to get outside of the conventional
application of time in fiction writing?
When and how did it begin?

According to Douglas Day, English
instructor at W&L, the Joycean
technique had its beginnings in the
18th century. In the 19th, English
and French writers came to be more

 

interested in the dramatic technique
than in the panoramic technique of
novel writing. The panoramic tech-
nique, Mr. Day said, can be com-
pared to an organism.

“The panoramic author paints a
picture. He begins at a specific point
in time, and carries his characters
through an orderly progression of
time. For instance, he will begin
with a central character in his youth |
and bring him to old age.

“The dramatic technique, on the
other hand, deals with the psycho-
logical complexities of characters.
The novel with the dramatic tech-
nique becomes more subtle, and time
is knocked out of the picture.”

Tristram Shandy a First

The first novel, according to Day,
to get outside of time was Lawrence
Sterne’s Tristram Shandy in 1851.
“This novel has no conventional
narrative sequence and has some-
thing which strangely resembles the
stream of consciousness technique.”

He said stream of consciousness
writing is “the attempt of the au-
thor to climb into our minds and
see reality as viewed from within.”

Mr. Day said that a novel cannot
be strictly chronological if it is to
be realistic, “because we don’t know
people chronologically.”

“To see a person truly and real-
istically, you have to see him from
a number of viewpoints and places
in time. To be really realistic, then,
the novel must get outside of time.

“Until relatively recently, time
was an aggregation—it was some-
thing accumulated, layered. It is one
of our stereotypes that we think of
time as neatly divided into the past,
the present, and the future.

“Modern philosophers would say
that this really isn’t the only way
to look at time,” Mr. Day said.

“Time, according to them, is a con-
tinuum. It has no beginning, no end,
and no middle. It is not just in a
straight line, but has body and more
than one dimension.”

“Time Is Relative”

“Time is relative, and it is a func-
tion of personality,” Mr. Day pointed
out. He said that “when we are ex-
cited, time passes fast, when we are
bored, it passes slowly.”

He insisted that “a minute is not
60 seconds long—it is as long as you
perceive it to be.”

What is the novelist attempting
to do besides be more realistic when
he gets outside of time?

 

A former R-T P ERITOR has
said that, ten years ago, the Board
of Trustees would not have both-
ered to comment on an incident
such as the recent Martin Luther
King episode. The fact that the
Board chose to recognize student
and faculty dissent marks a definite
change in attitude, he says.

The occasion for his comment was
a statement on the King decision by
University Rector James Caskie, of
Lynchburg.

HAVING OBTAINED the Com-

Dance Board President Steve Galef
now faces an unexpected problem:
finding a piano small enough to fit

Ellington has played before on the

STEVE HENRY’S ARTICLE in
last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi on
W&L’s basketball program aroused
varied comment among the members
of the Athletic Department. One
coach was heard to say that “Henry
is just bitter because he didn’t get
to play much on the freshman
basketball team.”

Another said: “Sure, most of it’s
true. But he didn’t have to say it.”

STEVE GALEF is working out de-
tails for a folk music festival on
the week-end of Spring Dances.
Tentative plans call for inviting up-
and-coming student groups from
northern and eastern universities.
The Dance Board would pay trans-
portation, and offer a_ substantial
cash prize to the most promising
group.

The contest would be judged by
a well-known artist, such as Theo-
dore Bikel, and by audience reaction.
It is thought that the event would
pay for itself.

Problem In Literature: Transcending Time

Mr. Day said that the novelist “is
trying basically to look at existence
in a different way, He is trying to
tell a story in a way it has not been
told before.”

“Novelists, in trying to present
time differently, range from the
complexities involved in a method
like the stream of consciousness
technique to the simple flashback
employed in the movies,” Mr. Day
said.

“James, and after him Joseph
Conrad and Ford Madox Ford, used
various mechanisms to get out of
presenting time conventionally.

“In very recent years, in this
century, James Joyce came to the
forefront as a stream of conscious-

one day and Finnegan’s Wake,
Joyce’s last novel, occurred at night
while a man is asleep.”

The recent exchanges between

two of the campus publications serv-
es to validate what is known as
Jenkinson’s law; that is, “everybody’s
crazy.” I find it amusing that the
Ring-tum Phi and Protest, both
supposedly dedicated to serving
their readers, should waste valuable
space and energy throwing verbal
brick-bats.

Many things are subtle in this
life, says the Prophet; one of the
best teachings on this point comes
from an old Pennsylvania Dutch
custom brought to light by the musi-
cal “Plain and Fancy.” When a mem-
ber of the community was in dis-
favor the other citizens simply re-
fused to acknowledge his presence
by “shunning” him.

The two publications by devot-
ing space and energy to each other
have lessened their stature, or so
it seems to me. The official Campus
Voice certainly strengthens the
other’s cause by taking great issue
with it. Nor is Protest furthering its
interests, for by retorting it only
serves to underscore its own ap-
parent shaky mental attitudes. But
its actions do more than this, it
sets itself up in the reader’s mind
as only a negative critical outlet
rather than the positive force it
proports to be.

Everybody’s crazy. No other rule
seems quite applicable; for to take
each other so seriously remains
only a source of amusement.

I-M Basketball Is Underway

Sigma Nu’s
Are Favored

Intra-mural basketball got under-
way this week, with Kappa Sigma,
ZBT, Sigma Nu, Phi Psi, KA, Beta,
and the Independents posting wins.

Tuesday night action saw the Betas
get a forfeit from PEPS, Sigma Nu
drop Pi Phi, and KA post a close
win over the Phi Delts.

Generals Will Meet
Catholic U. Tonight

Fresh from a 67-49 conquest of hapless Bridgewater, Wash-
ington and Lee’s basketball Generals bounce back into Dore-
mus Gymnasium tonight for a game against powerful Catholic
University.

Game time is 8 p.m.

W&L coach Bob McHenry calls Catholic ‘one of the best

we'll meet this year. We'll have to*

 

 

 

do better than we did against |
Bridgewater—a lot better.”
Offense

Catholic’s offense is built around |
the hot shooting of left-handed
Bob Horan, who carries a 24-point
average into tonight’s game.

A dangerous outside shooter, Hor-
an also dikes to drive.

He teams up with forward John
Spencer, who’s been averaging 15
points a game for Catholic so far
this year.

McHenry said that Catholic’s of-
fense depends on using the fast
break whenever possible.

team, the Sigma Nu’s showed why
they are favored to win not only
their league, but also the whole
school championship, which won’t
be decided until almost March.
With all five starters returning
from last year’s team that won the
runner-up honors behind the Cham-
pion Beta’s, Sigma Nu has the ma-
terial this year to go all the way.

Wednesday
In one of the wildest I-M games in
recent years, the Independents

scored a 41-40 win over the SAE’s
Wednesday.

Phi Psi won an overtime game
from the PiKA’s on the same night,
and established itself as a favorite in
its league.

On Thursday evening Kappa Sig-
ma took the court against SPE and
won by a 56-36 margin as Lance
Tarrance scored 17 points.

After getting off to a slow start, the
cagers from ZBT hit for ten consecu-
tive points as they defeated Lambda
Chi, 37-23. High scorer for the win-
ners was sophomore Billy Solomon,
who hit on an assortment of out-
side shots for seven field goals.
Freshman Art Sher also stood out
as he contributed nine points.

In the contest between Phi Psi
and PiKA, Phi Psi rallied in the
closing seconds of regulation play
to tie the score at 34 all. In the
first overtime period Chuck Lane
hit on a jump shot and a charity
toss to put the game out of reach
of the Pi KA’s. The final score was
38-35.

Bowling

In I-M bowling ZBT outclassed
Phi Ep as they won all three games
by large margins. Freshman Vic
Galef paced the winners as he posted
the highest three game score this
year, 650. His individual totals were
226, 222, and 202. After two matches
his 203 average is the best in the
league.

On Tuesday night Sigma Chi, KA
and Lambda Chi all won their con-
tests at the Lexington Bowling Al-
lies. Sigma Chi downed the repre-
sentatives from Phi Psi 3-1. Jon
Montague compiled a 487 total for
the evening.

In the KA-Phi Gam encounter,

Baby Generals
Post 3rd Win,
81-69 Over GMS

Five men hit for double figures
as the Washington and Lee fresh-
man basketball team posted its third
straight win, 81-69 over Greenbrier
Military Academy Wednesday night.

 

Forward Dick Livingston paced |
the Baby Generals with 24 points, |
despite the fact that he played only |

half the game because of early
foul trouble.
Jerry Kowalski, with 10, Scotty

Varney, with 14, George Madison
with 12, and Jay Girard, with 11,
also landed in double figures for
coach Joe Lyles’ charges.

Lyles called the Greenbrier win
“our best effort of the year.”

I propose this startling question: what is the toughest sport
at W&L? Football? Wrestling? Hell, no! It’s intramural
basketball! This great American sport, formerly a game of pre-
cision and non-contact, has been radically converted at W&L
into a blood and guts game, where anything goes and the cardi-
nal rule is hit or get hit.

Against Roanoke, W&L’s

Add to these chosen officials a

then place two opposing teams de-

you have a scene comparable to the

the fun. It’s almost as funny as
the varsity.

Why has this been allowed to hap-
pen? There is one main reason for
the lack of competent officiating.

This year the I-M directors have
deemed it necessary to keep people
from officiating who are affiliated
with any I-M basketball team. In
other words, a member of a partici-
pating team could not referee any

I-M games, not even in another
league.
This logically leads to exactly

what has happened: an almost total
lack of good officials. Let’s face it.
Just about anybody who knows any-
thing about the game is going to be
playing for his respective frater-
nity, or for the law school, or for
the Independent team. This leaves
a meager handful of people from
whom to choose referees.

This is the reason that referees
show up for the I-M games who do
not know the rules, who are unable
to keep order on the court, who let
the players call the shots, and who
are generally incompetent.

Basketball is perhaps the most
popular I-M sport. It’s ridiculous
that the officiating is poor. It costs
everybody involved, including the
I-M department, which actually pays
money for the farce.

wrestling as it easily downed the
grapplers from Pi Phi 25-10. After
forfeiting in in the 130 lb. class, Phi
Gam received 25 straight points as
five of their wrestlers won their
matches by pins.

In the match between DU and
Kappa Sigma, the matmen from KS
took the last two matches to squeak
out a 21-15 victory. With the score
tied at 15 all, Charles Dennis out-
lasted his opponent in the 177-pound
division. In the deciding match,
KS Rich Cruse defeated his heavy-

Freshman guard Louis Paterno,
who scored 10 points in the second
half rally that squelched Bridge-
water, will also see considerable ac-
tion.

Errors

McHenry said his squad will have
to correct the sloppy ball-handling
it displayed against Bridgewater,
especially against presses of both the
half court and full court variety.

Bridgewater’s full court press
during the first half of last Mon-
day’s game visibly shook the Gen-
erals, who made repeated ball con-
trol errors, resulting in easy baskets
for the Eagles.

In the second half, however, cap-
tain Bip Fauber and senior forward
Bill Ide sparked the Generals into
a 20-point lead that turned the game
into a runaway.

“We've got to watch our charging
fouls, too,” said McHenry. “We need
a lot more finesse out there.”

W&L’s next game is against Emory
and Henry away next Monday.

Is Time Theme A Blind Alley?

(Continued from page 2)
followers of Joyce, Dorothy Rich-
ardson, Virginia Wolfe, and Faulk-
ner in The Sound and the Fury all
use stream of consciousness.

A Blind Alley

What is the present status of time
in literature? Day believes that
stream of consciousness “seems to
have reached a blind alley.

“You cannot take fiction writ-
ing any more into chaos than by
going into the mind of a sub-
conscious man. In order to com-
municate, which is one of the pur-
poses of the novel, there must be
some order.”

 

Professor Day described the pres-
ent trend in France away from sub-|
jective techniques in fiction writing.
He said the trend there is to des-|
cribe only events in novel writing.
No symbolism or subjectivity at all
is used.

“Since we often follow France's)
literary example, there is a_possi-
bility that the trend will develop in,
this country.” |

He added, however, that “fiction |
and literature aren’t historical. You
can’t say what will happen.”

“My guess would be a return to/
something like conventional fiction,
perhaps a kind of reversion to writ- |
ing like that of past novelists.”

What about time in the new fic-
tion writing age, whatever it will
be?

Bake ie

 

 

 

SUN.-MON.-TUES.

 

 

 

 

Professor Day doesn’t believe that
stream of consciousness will be for-
gotten. It will have left its mark on
the literature of the ages.

“Time will be important to the
new novelists. It will probably be
approached differently, but it will
refiect the Joycean technique’s use
of time.”

will look and what it will contain.

As editor-in-chief, it is his deci-
sion that tells the tale on whether
or not a manuscript makes the pages
of PROBES, or whether it goes back
to the author as a reject.

 

“We haven’t had a chance to do}
much rejecting,” he says. “We really |
need as many contributions as we
can possibly get in order to make
PROBES a good magazine. The more
manuscripts we get, the better range

Honor System
Needs Thought

(Continued from page 2)

Members of the Executive Com-
mittee have admitted that this year
the EC is a more lenient group than
it has been in the past. If this is
true, then probably it is a result of
increased student concern with the
honor system. In any case, it should
be a welcome development to all,
even if only from that selfish point of
view—-because the life one saves

 

may be one’s own.
