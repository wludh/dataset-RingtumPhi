New Faculty
Appointees
Are Named

Men Hired In Sciences,
Greek & Latin, Sociology

Four new men have been appoint-
ed to the Washington and Lee fac-
ulty, Dean of the College William
W. Pusey III announced today.

They are Odell S. McGuire, in-
structor in geology; George S. Whit-
ney, instructor in chemistry; Her-
man W. Taylor, Jr., instructor in
ancient languages; and Emory Kim-
brough Jr., instructor in sociology.

All appointments are effective
September 1, Dean Pusey said.

The new instructors expect to ob-
tain their Ph.D. degrees during 1962.

McGuire, 35, a native of Knoxville,
Tenn., holds a B.S. degree from the
University of Tulsa and a M.A. from
Columbia University. He is now
studying at the University of Illin-
ais on a National Science Founda-
tion Fellowship. From 1957 to 1960,
he worked for the Texaco Explora-
tion Company at Calgary. He is
married and the father of two chil-
dren.

Whitney, 28, a native of Wheat-
land, Wyo., is a B.A. graduate of
the University of Colorado and
studied in Germany on a Fulbright
Fellowship. He is studying at North-
western University. He is married.

Taylor, 28, a native of Washing-
ton, D.C., attended Washington and
Lee from 1953 to 1955 and received
his B.A. degree from the University
of North Carolina. He is studying
at North Carolina where he is an
instructor in Greek and Latin. He
is married and has one child.

Kimbrough, 28, a native of Clarks-
ville, Tenn., received his B.A. from
Davidson College in 1957 and his
M.A. from the University of North
Carolina where he is continuing
graduate study. He has held a
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow-
ship and a Southern Fellowship.

Lexington’s
Bottle Club
Draws Elite

A number of faculty members are
reputed to have become members in
the Traveller’s Club, a private “so-
cial” club from which students have
been excluded.

An independent “social” group
(Bottle Club?), the Travellers have
of late set up operations in several
rooms of the Robert E. Lee Hotel.

An interview with a W&L figure
rumored to be secretary of the
club revealed no definite functions
of the organization. The club re-
portedly does have a_ president,
board of directors, and other offic-
ers; they seem to prefer anonymity.

Rumored to be slightly anarchist
in attitude, the club may have been
formed to negate the early closing
of the Liquid—that is, to provide
activity after eleven o’clock....

Another speculative reason for the
club’s existence is that some Lex-
ington adults may desire indepen-
dence from the fraternity houses for
a party.

Prompted by an obsession to limit
membership to the select few
deemed worthy of such grave re-
sponsibility, the group admits new
members by invitation only. The elite
of Rockbridge County—barring stu-
dents—has been combed for mem-
bership.

The Travellers are, says a spokes-
man, following the tradition of the
Old White at Greenbriar and the
James River Club at Lynchburg.
Similar clubs exist in most Virginia
cities; Richmond boasts five or six
of these hotbeds of intellectual
stimulation.

The most recent rumor among
many concerning the social (Bottle)
club is that they have been closed
down by the gendarmerie of the
city.

Swisher Slated
To Speak Here

Dr. Carl B. Swisher, a professor
of political science at Johns Hop-
kins University, will speak Tuesday
at Washington and Lee.

He will discuss “The Doldrums of
Belief: Oud Land and Our Tradi-
tion” at 8:15 p.m. in a public lecture
in Washington and Lee’s duPont
Auditorium. His appearance is un-
der the sponsorship of the univer-
sity’s department of political sci-
ence and the University Center in
Virginia.

Dr. Swisher, a former president
of the American Political Science
Association, is Thomas P. Stran
professor of political science at
Johns Hopkins. He has been teach-
ing there since 1937.

 

Yesterday evening, despite bad
weather and rough terrain, units of
the Washington and Lee ROTC
corps of cadets successfully attacked
and overran an aggressor position
located in the hills of the Liberty
Hall area.

This offensive took place as a
part of a series of tactical problems
presented to the members of the
cadet corps to test and improve their
ability to apply classwork matter in
the field. The first part of this series
was the compass problem held last
fall.

Advancing from an assembly area
each platoon individually attacks the
objective occupied by aggressors
forces and is brought under fire by
the enemy as it advances.

Realism is accentuated and the
problem made as lifelike as possible
by providing of both cadets and ag-

gressors with blank ammunition to
be fired from rifles and machine
guns as well as grenade launchers
with signal flares.

The purpose of this maneuver is to
familiarize cadets with the problems
of command and control during a
tactical situation and in addition to
give them practice in leadership.
The cadets, having been given pre-
vious instruction in attack forma-
tions and the employment of both
men and weapons are, by this field
problem, more able to understand
applications of the above concepts
in battle conditions.

The units in the assault are com-
manded by their own cadet officers
and both the commanders and the
members of the units are graded
and criticized as to their handling
of all matters during the taking of
the objective.

 

Dr. Milton Colvin, speaking to the
International Relations club Tues-
day night, said that nationalism is
still the most important force in
Germany. His topic was German
foreign policy.

He described the German youth
as less Teutonic, but, he said “We

 

 

Mighty IBM Monster
Daily Miracles Of Computation

By KENNETH LANE
Tuesday Writer

One of Washington and Lee’s lat-
est newcomers has been creating
quite a stir in the science depart-
ment. Given the distinguished ti-
tle of “IBM 1620 Data Processing
System,” this voracious monster of
blinking lights and jostling levers
can do amazing wonders. With a
mere flick of the switch, it can re-
duce days of human labor to a mat-
ter of mere minutes.

The most frequent users of this
remarkable instrument are teachers
in the departments of psychology,
chemistry, and physics, who have
managed to keep the machine well-
nourished with endless quantities of
facts and figures. Insatiably, the
computer devours the multitude of
statistics, spewing out the correct
solutions without fail. For the com-
puter, it’s all in a day’s work.

One of the most prolific feeders
of the machine is Dr. Leonard Jar-
rard, assistant professor of psychol-
ogy, who is currently experiment-
ing on how to get the machine to
think like humans. Struggling with
such highsounding terms as “concept
formation” and “symbolic reason-
ing,” I listened as Dr. Jarrard ex-
plained to me his project.

The theory is that by analyzing
the way students solve problems, the
scientist can come up with some sort

 

of consistent pattern by which prob-
lems are reasoned out. Using stu-
dents as subjects, Dr. Jarrard has
done considerable experimenting,
hoping to use the data he has col-
lected to derive some basic rules of
the thought process involved. The
final step is to apply these rules to
a “program” adaptable to the ma-
chine.

It sounds somewhat complicated,
but what scientists are hoping for
is a machine which can simulate
the workings of the brain. And pro-
gress is being made; at Carnegie
Tech, for example, they have a ma-
chine which can carry on a pretty
competent game of chess.

Another project of the psychol-
ogy department is the use of the
machine for calculating results from
tests on drug reaction. A half doz-
en rats are injected with varying
amounts of a certain drug and their
reactions are studied. The object is
to see how fast the rat can learn to
press a bar at the right time to get
food. The result of these experi-
ments leads to a mass of numbers
which would normally take days
to solve.

Yet with amazing speed and dex-
terity, the IBM comes up with the
right answer in a matter of minutes.
Dr. Jarrard commented that a job
like this had taken a student three
afternoons to figure out by the desk

Performs

calculator. The IBM did it in four
minutes.

Dr. John Wise of the Chemistry
department is putting the machine
to use in his study of wave lengths.
He explained his project as “con-
verting observed wave lengths in
the spectrum of rare earth elements
to a measurement of the energy of
light.”

The result of such an experiment
will yield important information
about the details of the atomic
structure. But in getting these de-
tails, the scientist must take pages
and pages of data and put them all
together into a formula. Worked by
simple mathematics, the task is a
gigantic undertaking. However, a
problem that formerly took all af-
ternoon to solve was done by the
IBM in a fantastic six seconds.

Like Dr. Jarrard, Dr. Wise is also
using the machine to work out a
statistical analysis of the results of
lab experiments. This is especially
effective in checking the accuracy
of students’ experiments. Dr. Ed-
ward Turner of the physics depart-
ment is likewise using the machine
as a short-cut for figuring out the
standard deviation of his students’
grades. He is also letting students
use the machine to check the accur-
acy of their lab experiments. As far
as employing the IBM for research,
Dr. Turner has no immediate plans.

 

 

German Nationalism
Labeled “Potent Force”

underestimate the strength and pull
of German nationalism among those
30 and older.” Colvin, who holds a
Ph.D. from the University of Hei-
delberg, is a foreign affairs expert
who has done concentrated work in
the German field. He is a member
of Washington and Lee’s political
science department.

West Germany’s new generation,
said Colvin, is growing up political-
ly orientated to the West, but the
older people look to the East, where
they hope to regain the land lost
after World War II.

Only Russia can give back to Ger-
many the East Prussian lands which
are now a large segment of Po-
land; likewise, Russia stands be-
tween East and West Germany. For
this reason many Germans would
like to renounce Western ties, to
follow a policy of “enlightened self-
interest” in the hope of a reunited
Germany.

Colvin estimated that in ten years,
as new generations rise, Germany
may be reconciled to its present
frontiers.

The speaker traced Germany’s
moral rehabilitation since World
War II, pointing out her efforts to
identify herself with the West. He
mentioned German support of Is-
rael and the reversal from anti-
Semitism, and military alignment:
the 12 German divisions in NATO
are the largest contingent of the alli-
ance. He also cited German partici-
pation in the Common Market.

In spite of this rehabilitation,
said Colvin, most Germans cannot
forget that they belong to the only
country in Europe which has lands
claimed but not occupied. The
truncated yermany looks to a
feature in the East, where lie East
Germany, East Prussia (Poland),
and a part of Czechoslovakia from
which 3 1/2 million Germans were
expelled following World War II.

As Germany rebuilds and rearms,
she frightens countries who
hold historic German land; they look

Freshmen Given

Honor System
Explanation

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Rosie Page, senior Executive Com-
mitteeman, Thursday night gave an
eloquent and stirring defense of
Washington and Lee’s Honor Sys-
tem. He spoke at a compulsory
freshman assembly in Lee Chapel,
called by the EC following contro-
versy over honor trials held earlier
in the week. In these trials, two
students were found guilty of hon-
or violations and a third chose to
withdraw from the university rath-
er than stand trial. Strong freshman
sentiment against the action taken
by the EC resulted in the assembly’s
being called.

Page, after explaining the Honor
System and describing the method
by which suspected violators are
tried, told the freshman “this was
the system they had chosen to live
under.” He said he knew of none
better, after having examined simi-
lar systems at other colleges.

Both he and Student Body Presi-
dent Uncas McThenia suggested that
anyone who did not like the Honor
System “leave now.”

Comparing a “little bit of dis-
honesty” to a “little bit of preg-
nancy,” Page declared that there
was no such thing. He cited as an
honor violation any act of lying,
cheating, or stealing—and said, that
since there are no degrees of dis-
honesty, there can be no degrees
of punishment.

He accused the freshmen of criti-
cizing something that they “hadn’t
taken the trouble to find out about.”
and pleaded with them to seek out
an EC member if there were any
points about the Honor System they
still did not understand.

The Year of Big Changes

This year will have to go down in the books as the Year of
the Big Changes in student government at Washington and
Lee. We have been overwhelmed with proposals from the Ex-
ecutive Committee, the Interfraternity Council, the Dance
Board, and the faculty. At times it has been rather difficult to
keep up with all the changes that have been accepted, much
less the various proposals and counterproposals that didn’t.

Here’s a summary of what has been going on:

The Executive Committee has decided to present two ma-
jor constitutional changes to the student body, and rejected a

third. They want to:

Do away with the nominating convention for the
Big Seven offices and require instead that candidates
get their names on the ballots by presenting a petition

signed by 150 of their fellow students.

Turn Openings, Springs, and Finals weekends over
to the sophomore, junior, and senior classes, respective-
ly, but continue to elect the president of Fancy Dress

weekend in a student body-wide election.

The EC rejected various proposals to replace the
Publications Board representative with either a repre-
sentative-at-large or an additional junior class repre-

sentative.

The EC has also voted to submit a number of minor
changes and clarifications in the constitution to the student
body for a vote along with the major changes noted above.
They will probably submit the changes as a single draft for an
entirely new constitution. The EC has not yet decided whether
they will seek a vote on the new constitution at the regular

spring elections or at a special election.

The Interfraternity Council has meanwhile voted to en-
courage the houses to restrict combos on the nights of big
University dances and has put considerably more teeth into
their rules against abuses of pledge training. They have a com-
mittee studying the rush system at the present time and will
undoubtedly take some action on the rush system before the
year is out, if only to voice satisfaction with the present system.

While the pace of reform has left many of us rather out
of breath at times, it seems to this column that the changes have
been well thought-out on the whole. They have been thorough-
ly discussed by the organizations involved and deserve support

from the student body as a whole.

We are fortunate that we have had men of the caliber of
Uncas McThenia, Steve Galef, and Bob Doenges in office
when the pressure for change became overwhelming. They,
however, could not have done nearly so well, if they had not
been backed up by an exceptionally able crop of student lead-
ers in the various campus posts. We think that the success of
the reforms they have advocated will add further to W&L’s
reputation for sound, independent student government.

Dean Gilliam’s Illness

We were sorry to hear of Dean Gilliam’s heart attack Sun-
day. We are happy to report, however, that doctors report that
his condition is good and that he is resting comfortably.

We join with the entire University community in wishing

Mr. Gilliam a full and speedy recovery.

By TRACY HARRINGTON

It seems as if spring has finally
come to Lexington. Later sunsets,
baseball and not-so-cold weather
give us a pretty good indication that
it’s about time for Madras coats and
Goshen weekends again. Another
symbol of the new season that’s a
sure sign winter’s over at W&L is
the field training of our own citizen
soldiers—the spring tactical problem
of the ROTC department.

This week, the military students,
decked out in appropriately ivy
green fatigues and armed with the
deadly M-1 rifle, migrated en masse
to the hill behind the tennis courts.

Each platoon of thirty men, in turn,
had to “take the objective” under
what were supposed to be simulated
battle conditions. The objective was
the crest of the hill, protected by
four men with rifles and a machine
gun.

The afternoon’s activity began,
ungloriously, in front of Doremus
Gym. From there the platoon
marched around the athletic field,

 

“THE BATTLE

OF THE HILL”

 

by the stadium and the tennis courts,
and through a garbage dump to the
assembly field.

Heroes in Green

Next the thirty foot-weary sold-
iers headed off to the line of de-
parture. (That’s military for the
place where they start shooting at
each other.) This was the base of
the hill that had to be taken, and on
top of which perched the four “en-
emies” with the machine gun and
individual rifles.

By this time our heroes in green
were muddy, tired, and ready to quit
playing. But they had to charge
Lexington’s counterpart of San Juan
Hill. About halfway up the hill, the
enemy started firing. The charging
soldiers started firing, too—but ran
into a little trouble when about half
the guns jammed. (It was discovered
later, according to an upperclass
ROTC student, that the govern-
ment had put ammunition in the
clips crooked. Oh, well...every-
body makes mistakes now and then.)

In the “actual combat situation,”

 

two main problems arose: either the
troops ignored the machine gun fire
and refused to hit the dirt like they
were supposed to, or they hit the
dirt and stayed there. It didn’t real-
ly matter, though—blank amuni-
tion was being used and they all
knew it.

No Ammunition

Valor prevailed. The four agres-
sors were taken by the thirty-man
platoons and casualties were kept
down to a few stumped toes and
muddy faces. With the hill in their
possession, the triumphant thirty
prepared for a counter-attack which
the defeated four were expected to
launch. They ran into a little troub-
le here, too; everyone had been good
about holding onto their rifles, and
not a one was lost—but some of the
befuddled foot soldiers were out of
ammunition. They just stood around
and tried to look inconspicuous dur-
ing the counterattack, which is
about as good a policy to follow as
any other in their predicament. At
any rate, they must have not been

 

Ah, Spring! Goshen, Madras, War Games

too decisive, for the agressors were
again thrown back in the counter-
attack.

After this, the game was over and
the good guys got with the bad guys
to hear from those who knew what
they had done wrong. The rest of
the afternoon and early evening was
spent in cleaing the dirty guns, re-
hashing the tactical blunders, and
trying to forget that they might have
to do it with real bullets someday.

The ROTC upperclassmen quoted
above estimated that if the ammuni-
tion had been real under the same
circumstances, 75 per cent of the
people involved would have been
killed. But, then, he’s not an expert.
Maybe 80 per cent of them would
have gotten it.

At any rate, the one week’s War
of the Hill is over, and as we turn
our minds to important things like
Spring Vacation and student elec-
tions, dirty fatigues and used-up
blanks are the only remnants we
have of the first true sign of spring
at W&L.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

To the Editor:

The recent finding of the Execu-
tive Committee with regard to three
students having violated the Hon-
or System does not seem to have
met with unanimous approval on the
part of the student body. The sad
part of any approval-disapproval on
the part of the students seems to lie
in the dilemma that those members
of the student body disapproving
can only do so on the basis of what
they hear to be the true facts. The
true facts upon which the final de-
termination is based are of course
secreted and if someone like my-
self chooses to voice an opinion he
can only reiterate and think about
those facts he has heard from the
grapevine. Hearsay is the word I am
looking for and so be it. If what I
have heard was not the basis of the
decision by the E.C. then I apologize.
If what I have heard are the facts
then I content myself with disagree-
ing.

I disagree as a law student from
a legal standpoint and as a dorm
counselor having had very close
contact with one of the individuals
involved.I disagree from an objec-
tive standpoint strongly feeling that

 

 

Law Student Objects To EC Decision

I know the character of one parti-
cular individual proscribed.

From a strictly legal standpoint,
one who steals does an act which
deprives another of his property.
The act of itself is not enough to
convict a person. That person must
also have had the mental requisite
of intention to steal. In legal terms,
a concurrence of the act of stealing
and the intention to so steal are nec-
essary to convict for larceny. The
theory I would like to advance may
not find approval in a court of law.
It probably was not considered in
our “court of law” on the campus,
but it may appeal to reason which
sometimes beats the hell out of
whatever other source we tap.

Suppose someone comes into my
room with the idea of picking up
some quick date money and filches
five dollars from my desk—he is a
thief. He intends to deprive me of
my property and does so. Unfor-
tunately for the E.C. it was not this
type of a situation. The facts were
very much more complex and as is
often said hard cases make poor law.
Remember now that I only disagree
and I am not saying who is right.

We Need Something More

By SPUD SLATER

Three of our brethren have left
school this week. Rumor has it that
they stole a 5-cent candy bar. Sin-
ners that they are, they have been
driven out of Eden. God be with
them. He moves in mysterious ways.

O, there is no god but the honor
system and the executive committee
is his prophet. How wonderous that
we can revere a system...a system.

Praise be for all blessings. He is
a local deity, this god of ours, whose
power is limited in time and space.
True faith in him endures 4 years
only, and in this place alone. Bless
the honor which we gain through
the sacrament of the pledge. What a
relief that the burden of this faith
is not imposed forever.

For where is honor without the
written affirmation? Write it not
and you need not be honest? I re-
nounce this god, for I revere no sys-
tem. I renounce the written pledge,
for what decency I may have lies
unseen within me. Yet I do affirm
unqualifiedly that sense of honor
which I hope was in me long be-
fore I pledged a paper; that honor
which transcends the limits of time
and space and a fallible, idolized

 

system.
¢* @

How sad it is that we must take
on honor only when we come to this
academy of better men! How sad that
we were not true before! How sad
that we will not have to be honor-
able when we go from this place!

Yet will we not be required to be
honest men, even when the bonds
of fear have been broken? (For this
god is a god of fear, this system we
revere; and so faith is invalid. What
honor can there be when fear en-
forces adherence? and when adher-
ence is only a temporary thing?)
Will there be no inward desire for
honor afterwards?

There can be—if we rise above
the limits of this system, if we rise
above unquestioning faith, unques-
tioning acceptance. For I say that
you cannot believe in this system
unless you believe in something
higher. And that which is higher
must be found within you. Conceive
your honor out of sincere devotion.

The South In The Sixties—Politics

 

Dissolution Of ‘Solid South’ Began With New Deal

By MR. R. N. LATTURE
Professor of Political Science

For a long time it was customary to speak of the
Solid South meaning that the Democratic candidate
for the presidency could definitely count on the entire
electoral vote of the southern states. In those days, be-
cause of the two-thirds rule of the national convention
of the Democratic party, the delegates from the South
could virtually veto the nomination of a presidential
candidate who was not acceptable to the South. The
political leaders of the South, mindful of the import-
ance of foreign markets for cotton, tobacco and rice,
were generally international in outlook.

This extraordinary political cohesion was due, of
course, to common memories of war and reconstruc-
tion, to cultural and religious values which they
shared, and to their strong feelings about maintaining
white supremacy. In some well-known instances, dem-
agogues rose to power on the strength of race preju-
dice.

In recent years there has been a steady growth in
industry in the South, a parallel growth of popula-
tion in the cities and a corresponding decline in the
relative importance of agriculture. Some of the south-
ern industries, such as textiles, confronted with com-
petition from abroad, are joining in the demand for
tariff protection.

Effects of the New Deal

Beginning with the New Deal legislation the leaders
of the Democratic party in the South have had difficul-
ty in supporting the party’s candidates for national of-
fice and the platforms on which they stood. The nation-
al leaders of the party have found it necessary to satisfy
the demands of the Democratic organizations in the
cities of the North. These organizations depend for their
existence on the votes of wage earners, of immigrants,
of Negroes, and of other minority groups. The national
leaders promise to advance the interests of workers, to

increase the minimum wage, to promote better housing,
to provide work or compensation for the unemployed,
and to use federal funds for other welfare purposes.
They press for civil rights legislation, for voting rights
for Negroes, for the desegregation of schools, and for
the desegregation of transportation and recreational
facilities. The national leaders of the party urge fed-
eral aid for the public schools and medical aid for
the aged.

Southern political leaders, backed by their constitu-
ents, oppose practically all of these programs. Follow-
ing the leadership of the senior senator from Virginia,
they are opposed to programs requiring large-scale
spending. Southern congressmen often unite with Re-
publicans to defeat liberal proposals. They are quite
willing to cooperate with Republicans along economic
lines in return for their support in blocking civil rights
legislation.

North vs. South

It’s quite evident that a great gulf separates the
northern and southern Democrats. In 1928 Mr. Hoover
carried Virginia and five other southern states. In
1948 a number of southern delegates bolted the Conven-
tion in Philadelphia when Mr. Truman was nominated
and a liberal platform adopted. J. Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina and Fielding Wright of Mississippi
led a Dixiecrat movement in opposition to the civil
rights commitments of the party program. These gen-
tlemen were the governors of the two states with the
highest proportion of Negro population. Alabama and
Louisiana joined South Carolina and Mississippi in giv-
ing their electoral votes to the Dixiecrat candidates.

In the last presidential election the feelings of
Mississippi voters were so intense that they rejected
the candidates and platforms of both major parties and
chose as electors men who were not committed to any
party. These electors cast their ballots for Senator
Byrd for President and for Senator Goldwater for
Vice President.

With reference to Mississippi, mention should be

made of the White Citizens Councils which completely
dominate the political life of that state.
Republicans in Virginia

In the last three presidential elections the voters of
Virginia have cast a majority of their ballots for the
Republican candidates. Senator Byrd, who is held in
high esteem all over the nation, has refused to speak in
behalf of the Democratic candidates. Mr. Byrd is op-
posed to the President’s proposal that the United States
purchase United Nations bonds to enable that body to
continue its functions. Almost the last action taken by
the Virginia legislature before its recent adjournment
was to pass a resolution urging Congress not to buy
United Nations bonds.

A large proportion of the voters in Virginia, as in
other southern states, resents civil rights legislation,
the Supreme Court decision calling for the desegre-
gation of schools, the granting of large sums of money
to aid in the underdeveloped countries, the proposal
to appropriate federal funds for school purposes and
the continued expenditures of federal funds for wel-
fare purposes.

The Supreme Court Decision

The decision in 1954, directing the desegregation of
schools, had a profound impact on the political life of
the South. The reaction of the political leaders has
been overwhelmingly hostile both to the decision and
to efforts to enforce it. The story of Little Rock and
of Prince Edward County, in Virginia, is well known
not only in America but in distant lands. The Com-
munists have seen to that. The application of desegre-
gation principles to transportation and recreational
facilities has met with stubborn resistance. The steps
taken by the Civil Rights Commission to open voting
privileges to Negroes has aroused vigorous reactions
in black-belt areas. Bus boycotts by Negroes, “sit-in”
demonstrations, and “Freedom Riders” led by non-
southerners have aroused bitter feelings. The mere
mention of NAACP or of Dr. Martin Luther King is

enough to cause the loyal southerner’s blood pressure
to rise. However, the non-violent methods used by
Negro leaders have kept violence to a surprisingly
low minimum.

It is noteworthy, also, that eight years after the
Supreme Court’s desegregation decision no Negro
child has been admitted to any white public school
in South Carolina, Alabama, or Mississippi.

The white primary laws have been declared un-
constitutional. There is a movement in Congress this
week to outlaw the use by states of the poll tax and
literacy tests as conditions for voting in federal elec-
tions. If this movement starts to gain headway South-
ern Congressmen will resort to filbustering and other
tactics which they have used often and effectively to
protect the traditional patterns of race relations in the
South.

Colorful Personalities

The South has given the nation its full share of
colorful political personalities. Among them are Huey
Long, of Louisiana, and Bilbo, of Mississippi. A much
larger number of favorably known southern leaders
are such men as Senator Fulbright, of Arkansas, and
Senator Byrd, of Virginia, or Representatives Carl Vin-
son, of Georgia, and Howard Smith, of Virginia.

These and other members of Congress from the
South have exerted great influence in the nation’s
politics. Most of them have gained their power through
chairmanships of congressional committeees. Being
from one-party states they are re-elected term after
term. Through the operation of the seniority principle
they eventually become chairmen of powerful com-
mittees when the Democratic party is in majority in
the house in which they hold membership. The chair-
man of a congressional committee exercises great pow-
er in advancing, modifying, or checking elgislation. As
a consequence of the seniority rule members of Con-
gress from southern states wield power out of pro-
portion to their numerical strength.

4-4 Deadlock Broken
In Third Period Flurry

Australia’s All-Star lacrosse team sloshed to a 10-8 win
over Washington and Lee’s Generals Wednesday in the third
game of an extended United States tour for the Aussies.

Earlier this month, the Australians dumped Duke 15-3,
and lost to the University of Virginia 19-15.

Aussies broke down a 4-4 deadlock with three goals in the third
period. Neill and Campbell each scored once during the stanza.

Battling back, W&L trimmed the*
Australians’ margin to 8-7 midway
the fourth period on two straight
goals by midfielder John McDaniel,
but the Generals never got any
closer.

Key Men

Neill and Campbell were the key
men in the Aussie’s attack with
three goals apiece. Neill also had one
assist.

The visitors struck first, jumping
off to a 3-1 lead in the opening peri-
od as attackman Brian Griffin scored
twice.

By halftime the Generals had
moved into a 4-4 tie on scores by
defenseman Bart Mitchell, midfield-
er Charlie Gummey and attackman
Carroll Klingelhofer.

First Game

Senior Ray Miller, playing his first
game at goal for W&L, turned in a
standout performance. The former
attackman was credited with 16
saves, including several on shots
which appeared to be goals.

Australia now is 2-1 for its Am-
erican tour, having previously beat-
en Duke and lost to Virginia. The
visitors’ next game is scheduled
Saturday at College Park, Md.,
against Maryland’s powerful Terps.

 

  
 
 

 

 

ROTC, Weather
Delay Baseball

Washington and Lee’s promising
baseball team has been having trou-
ble getting any practice so far this
spring. A combination of bad weath-
er, ROTC, and outside activities
have held practice time to a mini-
mum.

The baseballers were behind
Springfield College 4-5 on Monday,
when bad weather and advancing
darkness called the game to a halt.
Sophomore Brice Gamber pitched
the first two innings but still suffers
from some early-season wildness.
Senior righthander Phil Sharp was
impressive in a _ third-inning ap-
pearance against the Massachusetts
team.

Lyles singled out center-fielder
Robin Wood, catcher Jim Russ, right
fielder Buck Rose, and second base-
man Park Gilmore for outstanding
performances so far. Wood smacked
a 350-foot double against Spring-
field.

W&L lost a chance for another
practice game when Springfield
pulled out of town, hoping to find
better weather elsewhere.

 

 

 

 

Dartmouth First

Coach Cy Twombly’s Washington

The Generals with six lettermen
returning from last year’s team, are
favored against Dartmouth, but
Twombly is worried because bad
weather has hampered spring prac-
tice.

“We've just had about three days
of good weather since February,
and our boys haven’t been able to
get on the course too much,” he
said.

Letter To The Editor

(Continued from page 2)

We have already empowered the
E.C. to determine the right answer
and the only power left is one of
disagreement.

If someone’s paramount and true
intention was to beat the machine
in the playful and destructive sense
of an eighteen-year-old boy as op-
posed to the intention to steal candy
bars, which the E.C., in my opinion,
must have found to properly con-
vict him of stealing, then a hair-
line distinction properly made could
have prevented an injustice as I see
it. I feel very strongly that this
student would not have taken some-

thing from that machine if the front
of it was off and the property was
exposed. I therefore feel he did not
have the requisite specific intention
to steal but had the overriding
“slap-his-hand” intention to play
around with the machine if such a
distinction could possibly be rec-
ognized.

Taking into consideration the age
and general character of the indi-
vidual, whom I feel to be a gentle-
man, I believe that his true inten-
tion would not be that of a thief.
There are very few of us who
haven’t at one time or another
found delight in beating a machine.
How many times has that machine
beaten us! At the same time, I

 

know none of us would take that

candy bar from the guy next door.
I feel this individual would not
have either. I feel this makes him
like us, a little different than the
thief who we would all agree should
be expelled for stealing. Somehow
this makes some sense to me, how-
ever little it made to the E.C. Mon-
day night.

As I have already stated I simply
disagree with the decision. I know
most of the students on the E.C.
and have the highest respect for
each and every one of them. There
is no doubt in my mind that the
interests of our Honor System as
well as the interests of the students
immediately concerned were given
the greatest of consideration.

and Killebrew entered the final 200
yords shoulder to shoulder. The
freshman from Phi Psi proved the
better finisher as he won this event
in 2:19. Patton was clocked in 2.20.

After taking third in the 440 yard
dash, Beagle of Phi Kap outrun
bare-footed Billy Angel of ZBT to
win the 220 yard dash. Beagle was
timed in 25.6 seconds, while Angel
was 0.4 seconds behind the winner.

In intra-mural handball, the play-
ers from Phi Gam are undefeated
in the post season tournament and
are favored to win the champion-
ship. ZBT gave the favorities the
most competition to date as they lost
11-15, 15-10, and 12-15.

On Monday night SPE faces ZBT
in a contest that will decide the team
to oppose Phi Gam in the finals. In a
earlier meeting ZBT won easily 15-9,
