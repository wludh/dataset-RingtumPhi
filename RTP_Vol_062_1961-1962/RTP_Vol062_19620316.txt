Jere Cravens
Named Top
Sophomore

By MALCOLM MORRIS

The Phi Beta Kappa Sophomore
Award for 1962 has been awarded to
Jere Davies Cravens, a Sigma Phi
Epsilon pre-med student, it was an-
nounced today.

The award, given annually by

semesters of his college career. The
purpose of the award is to encourage
scholastic endeavor among under-
graduates during their first years
at Washington and Lee.

Cravens received a National Merit
Scholarship after graduating as val-
edictarian of College High School in
Bartletsville, Oklahoma.

After his first semester at W&L
he was initiated into Phi Eta Sig-
ma, and he later received the chem-
istry achievement award as well as
a chemistry research grant.

As a sophomore this year, Cravens
received the physics achievement
award and was also initiated into
Alpha Epsilon Delta, honorary pre-
med fraternity. He serves as comp-
troller of SPE, is publicity director
of the Glee Club, and has been ac-
tive in the Graham-Lee Literary
Society.

In each of his three semesters at
W&L Cravens has compiled a per-
fect 3.0 grade point average.

The Phi Bete award entitles the
recipient of $25 worth of books of
his choice.

Last year the award was given to
Meade Christian.

Galef Offers Plan To Eliminate
Dance Presidents, Revamp IFC

By LARRY MEEKS

Proposals to eliminate the dance
set presidents and to have the IFC
President elected by all fraternity
men were made by Senior Execu-
tive Committeeman Steve Galef in
Monday night’s EC meeting.

Under Galef’s plan, class presi-
dents will replace dance set presi-
dents. The office of President of
Fancy Dress, however, will be re-
tained. The second proposal is aimed
at correcting some of the current
problems of the IFC.

Both of these proposals will prob-
ably be voted on in the EC meeting
next Monday night. If they pass the
EC, they will be voted upon by the
student body this spring and, if
passed, will go into effect next
spring.

Under the new dance plan, the
President of the Junior class along
with the other officers and any vice
presidents that he might need would
be responsible for Openings. The
Sophomore President and his group
would be responsible for Springs,
and the Senior Class President and
his group for Finals.

 

The Senior Class President was
chosen for Finals because, as of this
year, Finals will be planned espec-
ially for Seniors but open to the
entire student body.

To Retain Fancy Dress

The office of President of Fancy
Dress will probably be retained be-
cause, as Galef said on behalf of
the Dance Board, “We feel that the
President of Fancy Dress should be
retained to insure the continuation
of the Fancy Dress traditions. We
also feel that he should be elected
along with the student body officers
each spring.”

Galef gave the following reasons
for the proposed change:

1. Under the present system, the
Presidents of the dance sets have
little to do and find it difficult to
get cooperation from the students.
We hope that this proposal would
help eliminate this problem.

2. It would give class officers con-
crete projects and make them some-
thing more than stepping stones for
those with political aspirations.

3. It is hoped that such a change
would create a certain amount of

 

Big Business At W&L: Student
Groups Handle $60,000 Yearly

By STEVE SMITH

Washington and Lee student or-
ganizations handled over $60,000 last
year, according to figures released
yesterday by Sam Rayder, vice-
president of the Rockbridge Nation-
al Bank and treasurer of student
body funds.

The 1961-61 total of $62,695.65 is
approximated each year by the Pub-
lications Board, Dance Board, and
the EC, Rayder said.

The Calyx, Ring-tum Phi, South-
ern Collegian, and Dance Board all
showed profits at the end of the
1960-61 school year according to the
W&L Student Body Fund Financial
Report. At the beginning of this
school year the Publications Board
had a reserve fund of $8,141.62; the
Dance Board reserve stood at $5,-
352.24; and the EC was credited with
$4,621.47. These savings have been
accumulated over the past 30 years.
Rayder invests the reserve funds
for the student body in local mort-
gage loans and United States bonds.

All the money is spent through
Rayder.

Each fall the student body pro-
vides a basis of operations for its
officers and editors when it pays the
campus tax. The tax, which last year
was $10.07, was cut to $10.00 this

year, and totaled $11,990.00, said
Rayder.
Each organization except the

Dance Board receives a fixed pro-
portion of the fee. The Calyx is giv-
en over half the total, and the Ring-

tum Phi about a fourth. The re-|

 

mainder is split among the South-
ern Collegian, the EC, the cheer-
leaders, and the Student Bar Asso-
ciation. 1960 was the last year the
Debate Team received a share of the
tax.

The Dance Board relies solely on
subscriptions to the dance plan for
its start in the fall.

The 1960-61 campus tax gave the
Calyx $6,535.20. Another $6,250.00
was brought in by the sale of pic-
tures. Advertising brought $2,055.00,
and sale of books $380.00. This gave
the yearbook a total budget of $15,-
220.20, of which $948.57 was left in
the Publications Board fund after
all costs were paid.

The 1960-61 Ring-tum Phi receiv-
ed $3,010.86 from the campus tax,
$2,028.75 from subscriptions, and
$3,932.80 from advertising, After all
disbursements, $634.51 was _ trans-
ferred to the Publications Board
fund.

The Southern Collegian collected
$1,190.34 from the campus tax, $104.-
94 from subscriptions, and $1,735.97
from advertising. After its expenses
the humor magazine turned in $328.-
87 to the Publications Board fund.

The Dance Board sold 762 dance
plans, clearing $17,499.34 after giv-
ing $1,374.46 to the Dance Board
fund. Door receipts added $896.00.
With this budget the Board spent
$4,399.48 on Openings, $6,370.35 on
Fancy Dress; $4,628.63 on Springs;
and $2,888.38 on Finals.

The EC received a total of $657.70
from the campus tax and the Stu-

 

dent Body Fund. All of this amount
was spent for Honor Case expen-
ses, printing and supplies, and mis-
cellaneous expenses.

The cheerleaders and the debate
team were allotted only $58.35 each
from the campus tax. The Student
Bar Association received $116.70
from the tax.

The Student Body Reserve Fund,
which does not include finances of
the Publications or Dance Boards,
showed $4,621.47 on September 4,
1961.

The IFC, which operates under
Rayder but apart from the other or-
ganizations, spent $2,442.60 last year,
most of which was provided by
freshman rush fees.

Ray Robrecht, student body vice-
president, holds authority over the
funds at the student end. Although
the Publications and Dance Boards
operate autonomously, the student
body constitution says both must be
amenable to the EC in their policies.

In his capacity as student body
treasurer, Rayder has spent more
time in extra-curricular activities
than any student. A W&L gradute,
he was the first and only student to
serve as treasurer. He has held the
job ever since.

As a freshman he took a job
with the Rockbridge Bank. Now he
is a vice-president and trust of-

ficer of the bank.

Until 1955 Rayder was also finan-
cial adviser to all fraternities. He
still serves as adviser to his own
house, Sigma Chi.

class spirit and unity which is lack-
ing under the present system. Per-
haps, such a move would lead to
other class projects.

4. It is also hoped that such a
change would create a greater in-
terest in the dance sets themselves
and involve more students in their
preparations.

The IFC President

The proposal to make the office
of IFC President elective will also
be voted on at next week’s meeting.

It is Galef’s opinion that “He
(the IFC President) would certainly
have more prestige, as the election
would be held along with the elec-
tions for the “Big Three.”

Another advantage of this pro-
propocal, according to Galef, is that
men could run for office on a defi-
nite platform and the president
would be elected more on qualifica-
tions and views than along the 10-8
party split.

It is also felt that the proposal,
if passed, would generate greater
interest on the part of the student
body in the IFC. The EC would
still retain the power to name the
President’s replacement if he should
become unable to serve for any
reason.

The office would be open to any
upperclassman in a fraternity. The
constitution now states that the
president must have previously serv-
ed on the IFC, but such a qualifi-
cation would probably not be nec-
essary as the candidates would prob-
ably be running on experience.

Galef said the EC would like to
have opinions or suggestions from
any interested members of the stu-
dent body before these proposals
come up for a vote.

The remaining officers of the IFC
would be elected by that group at
the beginning of each school year.

Televised Meet

By LARRY MEEKS

Al Eckes, Bill Noell, and Bill
Boardman, debating for W&L de-
feated a North Carolina team on an
hour-long televised debate Monday
night.

The program was broadcast live
from Chapel Hill to an audience of
some quarter million people. The
W&L team took the affirmative side
of the debate topic: That the U.S.
should withdraw from the United
Nations.

W&L was awarded the decision by
a panel of three judges. Previously,
the North Carolina team had de-
feated Duke University in a similar
debate on the same program.

The W&L victory entitles them to
return to Chapel Hill for a second
televised debate on April 9.

The subject of the debate and the
opponent has not yet been named,
although there is a possibility that
the opponent will be Davidson Col-
lege.

Mr. Chaffin said he hopes to
schedule an intercollegiate debate
on the W&L campus to give the
home fans a chance to see the var-
sity debaters in action. Meanwhile
interested students may see debates
on various subjects at the Forensic
Union meetings.

Journals Print
Moore’s Articles

Two articles by an instructor in
English at Washington and Lee have
been published by two different
journals.

A story entitled “I Wonder As I
Wander” by Jack B. Moore has been
included in the current issue of the
New Mexico Quarterly. His second
article, “David Morgan and the In-
dians,” appears in the January is-
sue of the West Virgina History
Magazine,

The fiction piece deals with an
itinerant minister in West Virginia
while the second story traces the
origin of the folktale about the West
Virginia hero David Morgan.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1960, Moore re-
ceiveed his bachelor of arts degree
from Drew University in 1955 and
his M.A. degree from Columbia Uni-
versity in 1955. He currently is
working on his Ph.D. from the Uni-

 

 

versity of North Carolina.

* Each of the news heads announced

plans to improve the Calyx. Payne
said his main objective will be “to
put more life into the yearbook.”
Boardman has made plans to run
the Calyx in a more businesslike
manner.

Payne said that the theme for
his book will center around the
university crest and motto: “Not
unmindful of the future.” He will
tie in the motto with a theme of
university progress.

The new editor announced a ten-
tative staff headed by Cotton Rawls
and Syd Butler, managing editors.

Other staff members will be Vic
Galef and Buck Ogilvie, classes edi-
tors; Barry Greene, organization
editor; Jay Caplan and Arthur
Sheer, fraternities editors; Chuck
Lane and John Madison, athletics
editors; Dick Copelan, administra-
tion editor; and Dick Spenser,
features editor.

Boardman has a plan to keep the
Calyx records on the IBM machine
in order to improve accuracy and
completeness. He intends to put
more pictures of law students and
non-fraternity men in the book.

Next year’s business manager said
he also will increase the amount of
advertising in the Calyx by careful
campaigning.

A tentative business staff of four
was announced: in-town ad manager,
Jerry Turner; out-of-town ad man-
ager, Mack Applefeld; office man-
ager, Dillard Munford; studio man-
ager, Phil Lemon.

Payne, vice president of the jun-
ior class, will be one of the tri-cap-
tains of the football team next fall.
He is a dormitory counselor.

Boardman, junior class historian,
is one of the state’s outstanding de-
baters.

Psi Chi Elects
7 New Members

Dr. William Hinton, professor of
psychology, announced today that
seven students have been elected
to Psi Chi, the National Honorary
Society in Psychology.

The students are James H. Austin,
Jr., Stephen Chernay, John Har-
court, Jr., George Hickam, Robert
Lewis, Donald McClure, and Robert
Stone.

In order to qualify, these students
have had to take at least nine se-
mester hours of psychology and
made a grade within the upper third
of all undergraduates enrolled in
psychology.

Psi Chi has existed for 29 years
and at present 45% of its members
are undergraduates majoring or
minoring in psychology.

The president of the Washington
and Lee Chapter is Donald Stubbs, a
senior, and its advisor is Dr. Hinton.

Strengthen

Class Ties

The suggestion that one dance weekend be administered
by the junior class, and one by the seniors, seems to us to have
considerable merit. It would strengthen class ties and make class
presidencies more meaningful offices. The elected Dance Set
presidents have done very competent jobs but their respon-
sibilities do not compare with the three student body officers
with whom they are elected now. Nor does it seem to us that
a dance set presidency is an appropriate stepping stone to a
student body office, as they often are at present.

Steve Galef’s ideas on this point deserve careful consid-
eration. As president of the Dance Board he is more familiar
with the problems of the dance sets than anyone else in school.
We hope the student body and the Executive Committee will

give them a full discussion.

Troubs Deserve Praise

The heavy sales for this week’s Troubadour performances
of “Othello” point to the fine job that Dr. Cecil Jones and his

student actors are doing. Dr. Jones’s enthusiasm and compe-

tence, together with the hard

work and talent of men like

Troub President John Dunnell have given W&L a theatre of
which we can be very proud. We look for them to make a con-
tinued contribution to the University’s intellectual life.

A Trend Toward Mediocrity

Congratulations to Bob Payne and Bill Boardman on their
elections as editor and business manager of the Calyx. They
will have their work cut out for them. We have hopes that the
1962 Calyx, which will not appear for a couple more months,
will reverse the trend toward mediocrity which has been ap-
parent the past few years. If Joe Goldstein does it this year,

Payne will find his job easier.

College yearbooks have traditionally been an opportunity
for men with graphic or literary talent to show their stuff. In
the past few years, however, the Calyx has been untouched by
talent of any kind. The editorial staff has exhibited all the
worst characteristics of a bureaucracy. It will take several years,
no doubt, to build the yearbook back up to the W&L stand-
ards of ten years ago and several more to raise it to the plane
of the best contemporary annuals at other colleges. But we wish
New Editor Payne all the luck in the world. We are sure he'll

provide the necessary hard work.

The South In The Sixties...

 

Growing Ind

By DR. STANLEY T. LOWRY

The observer of the national econ-
omy is immediately struck by the
fact that economic activity is not ev-
enly spread throughout the country
like water in a shallow pan. Instead
one finds economic activity, and
particularly industrial activity, con-
centrated in clusters like droplets
of water on a highly waxed table
top, resisting the pull of uniform dis-
persion by surface tension.

The forces that tend to hold in-
dustry where it is, and those that
tend to draw it to new places are
better understood as developmental
rather than equilibrating forces.
For purposes of general discussion,
these elements can be abstracted
theoretically with more clarity if the
highly varied detail of individual in-
dustries is dispensed with.

Types of Locational Pulls
on Industry

The first and most obvious stim-
ulus to location of industry is the
pull of mineral deposits which tend
to be unevenly distributed on the
earth’s crust. Agricultural soils
which produce important cash
crops have a similar character and
provide a base for extractive indus-
tries. Their main character is that
they require a significant part of the
production to be located at the
source of the raw material.

From the point of view of econ-
omic development, however, there
are a number of severe drawbacks
to this type of industry. Much of the
work that must be performed at the
source of supply is highly unskilled;

 

or, by the same token, it can be per-

formed by heavy machinery so that
income brought into the area is in
the form of low wages or royalties
which are usually too thinly or too
concentratedly disbursed to achieve
a significant development impact on
the economy.

Too often, with the depletion of
natural resources subject to extrac-
tive development, an area is left
with a poorer resource base, a dis-
located agrarian economy, but with,
if fortunate, an improved transpor-
tation system. This was the case in
much of the South where commer-
cial agriculture and_ shortsighted
forestry developed resources and
depleted them, leaving no significant
progress toward industrialization in
their wake except improved trans-
portation facilities.

The flourishing chemical industry
on the Louisiana and Texas coasts,
however, exemplifies an extractive
industry whose general area of loca-
tion has been so stable for a suffici-
ently long period combined with
certain legal pressures and techno-
logical developments so that secon-
dary processing, by-products, and
finally finished goods have been
drawn to the raw material source,
and the extractive oil industry there
has served as a developmental stim-
ulus of great significance.

‘Gregarious” Industries

The second type of industry with
which we are concerned are the
“gregarious” industries, i.e., those
that tend to locate where others al-
ready are located. Almost all small
industries, particularly those em-
ploying skilled labor, find the pro-

 

 

TROUBADOURS PRESENT ‘OTHELLO’

 

Allen Re-Creates Timeless Hero

By MAC McCLUNG

In the opening night performance
of Shakespeare’s Othello Wednes-
day, the actors and actresses of
the Troubadour Theatre wrought
from this brilliant tragedy a living
reproduction of the vitality and life
which is contained in Shakespeare’s
verse.

As a tragedy of jealousy and re-
venge, Othello presented us with
characters of high motivation and
a wide range of emotions. Bob Al-
len, playing the title role, built
from scene to scene the figure of
a man whose whole soul was
wracked with auguish, pity, rage,
and revenge.

We saw him first as a calm, trust-
ing, and self assured warrior-groom,
happy in his new estates and al-
most boyishly exuberant. His trans-
formation from that character into
the tortured monster was more than
convincing. We felt, with him, the
painful growth of the seed of jeal-
ousy planted by Iago; and while
Othello wept and roared as he
moved toward final destruction, the
timeless universality of Shakes-

 

peare’s character came home to us
because Bob Allen brought it there.

Dunnell’s Performance

John Dunnell, as Iago, matched
Othello action for action. Lacking
the simple emotional appeal of Oth-
ello, Iago presented his audience
a soul filled with evil and a mask
worn in cunning. He too, met his
audience, and throughout the first
half of the play, Where Iago car-
ries the emotional impact of the ac-
tion, his revenge and plottings, how-
ever evil found identity. The villain,
even in Shakespeare, can be stereo-
typed; this seems to be especially
true in Othello, where the villain’s
role is the choice part for the dis-
play of the actor. In this production,
the role did display the actor; but
more important, the actor filled his
role and gave Iago the base egoism
that made him a villain so realistic
and so hated.

Lisa Tracy as Desdemona brought
a freshness and spirit of love and
innocence and youth to her role. She
brought to us a Desdemona who ra-
diated with the love and joy and
happiness of youth as well as the

 

courage and faith of maturity. In
the scene in which she sings the
famous Willow Song, she brought
her character to a perfect point, a
plateau on which her fullness was
sustained to the point of her death
in the final scene.

Colvin Convincing

Cassio, portrayed by Steven Col-
vin, was dramatically convincing.
The role is that of a gentleman, not
by our standards, but by those of
Shakespeare; a character of noble
ideals. His veneration of Desde-
mona and his loyalty to his gov-
ernment and Othello earn that ti-
tle for him. His idealism was never
contrived or unnatural, and in this
respect Steve Colvin triumphed in
his role and made even his gen-
tlemanly shame convincing. He
seemed a man of another era and
the fact that he returned, with life,
is to the credit of the actor.

Tim Morton’s performance as
Roderigo was excellent; lured by
Iago into a false hope that his love
for Desdemona is to be realized and
maneuvered and used by Iago as a
tool in the latter’s revenge, his

 

Slater, Quoting “Lonely Crowd,”
Calls W&L Men Other-Directed

By HOWARD SLATER

The Lonely Crowd by David Ries-
man is a highly perceptive analysis
of contemporary society in Ameri-
ca; and, although the thought may
not be new, its findings about the
whole of American society can be
observed also on the W&L campus—
and probably on most college cam-
puses in the U.S. for that matter.

In the belief that the attempt may
prove instructive, I would like to
state some parallels to Reisman’s
observations. At the same time, I
want to make clear that I am not
adopting the cautious approach
with objective, scientific sociolo-
gists seem prone to take. There is no
sense in being inconclusive when
I firmly believe not that there may
be a fundamental similarity between
contemporary “other-directed” so-

ustries

cess of economic activity “better
oiled” in areas where a great many
other industries are already located.
This characteristic of efficiency and
convenience in shipping, hiring,
maintenance, etc., are aspects of the
surface tension effect mentioned
above that tend to hold industry in
pre-existing centers.

The virtue of this process is that
once an area starts developing, it
tends to re-enforce its own ex-
pansion. This hope of “breaking
through” into the “drawing card
league” is the hope of all moderate
sized cities trying to induce indus-
try to locate in their area. This char-
acteristic is the force behind the
rapid urbanization of the nation, na-
tionally classed as 70 per cent ur-
ban, but only 60 per cent in the
southeastern (Sixth Federal Re-
serve District) and 40 per cent in
Mississippi.

Many southern cities which cur-
rently exhibit rapid growth have
reached this category and are draw-
ing industry, but the development
concept must be kept in mind since
new industry or new branch plants
rather than “moved industry” char-
acterize much of this growth.

Market-Oriented Business

The third type of industry is the
highly market oriented business that
is under heavy economic pressure
to produce as close to the market as
possible because of high transpor-
tation costs of the finished product
compared to the raw materials, or
the highly personal nature of service
industries. These also re-enforce ur-
banization, and they go to places

(Continued on page four)

 

ciety and the W&L student body,
but that there actually and object-
ively is such a similarity.

Riesman defines “other-direction”
as a social character which is prim-
arily sensitive and attuned to the
attitudes, thoughts, and emotions
of others. In fact, the attitudes and
values of the other-directed indi-
vidual are determined for the most
part by those around him. This
present period of other-directedness
is distinguished from all previous
eras during which the predominant
social character—the normal social
responses—were directed either by
tradition (tradition-directed) or by
internalized values (inner-directed).

No Value Judgments, Please

Two comments concerning this
definition are in order here: One
is that the other two types of so-
cial character are found in our so-
ciety; but it is the other-directed
type which is most numerous. And
two, it is foolish to make value
judgments about the relative worth
of the types of social character on
the basis of this fundamental de-
finition. Other-directedness, for in-
stance, can be valued most highly
by those who put a premium on
consideration for others and human-
itarian sensibilities.

 

With these considerations in mind,
we may now ask where do we find
other-directedness in W&L? The
obvious beginning is of course in
the fraternities; and since fraterni-
ties are the primary institutions in
the social structure of the student
body, it is immediately apparent
that the W&L social character—the
so-called “typical” W&L man—is
other-directed. This is so because
fraternities are transitory by their
very nature in their effect on fra-
ternity men.

A fraternity is, at most, a four
year affair, and especially since
fraters develop attitudes dependent
on those of other fraters, members
are required to give only temporary
adherence to the fraternity’s com-
mon values. It seems to me, more-
over, that these common values of-
ten change within the span of an
individual’s college career.

Now, About Sex...

Another manifestation of other-
directedness occurs in the realm of
sex, As in modern society as a
whole, it seems to me that the other-
directed W&L man desires to talk—
or is pressured into talking—about
his “sexual achievements,” not as
a means of bragging and gaining re-

“Protest” Editor Lowry Defends Disarmament Stand

To the Editor:

Tracy Harrington’s article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi reflects an
attitude quite common in America
today; I refer to his opinion that
thermonuclear war is inevitable, that
“the only way man can ever be
made to do away with nuclear war
is to have one.”

Mr. Harrington’s position, that of
putting his hands over his head and
waiting for the bomb to fall, reflects,
to my way of thinking, the great
feeling of frustration which results
from not being able to do anything
about the present situation.

I am quoted as having said,
“Something must be done.” This is
a fair statement. I am not willing
to accept the position that thermo-
nuclear war has to be inevitable.
(For, if war is inevitable, we’re
going to be destroyed anyway; why
not unilaterally disarm, as we cer-
tainly have nothing to lose. There
is as much chance of surviving a
Soviet take-over, assuming that this
would also be inevitable, as of sur-
viving a thermonuclear war. What
good is freedom, if no one is left to
enjoy it?) I resent, therefore, being
forced to make the choice implied in
the stupid slogan, “Better Red than
Dead,” or for that matter, “Better
Dead than Red.”

I do reject such concepts as
“limited warfare,” the so-called
“balance of terror,” and “massive
retaliation,” as I reject any nuclear
policy based on deterrence. This is
not because “the human race isn’t
intelligent enough to refrain from
using weapons,” but because the
more we pile up armaments, the
more we become reconciled to the
inevitability of thermonuclear war,
and the less human factors have any
control over the situation.

I am not, as Mr. Harrington states,
an advocate of unilateral disarma-
ment. I do, however, feel that there
are certain unilaterial steps we can
take, in the interest of futhering
peace, even though they might hurt
our national pride. An example of
this would have been refraining
from announcing and preparing for
nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in
the interests of the forthcoming
Geneva talks, not to mention the
unknown deaths and mutations
caused by the addition such tests
would bring to atmospheric radia-
tion. Surely this would have been a
small concession, since the inevi-
tability of thermonuclear war may
well depend on it. A further ex-
ample might be our rejection of the
concept that everything the So-
viets do must be seen as an aspect
of the cold war struggle, instead of
deciding each issue on its respective
merits and its relation to the real
needs of mankind.

Essentially, of course, the way out
of our dilemma is not a military,
political or economic one, but a mor-
al decision. We are faced with a
moral problem; therefore a moral
solution is required. It is time for
us to begin to practice those values
to which we supposedly adhere.

W. B. LOWRY, JR.

 

tragedy, too, was that of the hard
hand of fate. But there was an ele-
ment of pathos in Roderigo due to
the fact that he was weak and al-
lowed himself to be led into a situa-
uation which a realistic man would
have viewed as hopeless. This dual-
ity was deftly exhibited in the char-
acter, and thus the role which often
seems to be a simple one at first
glance was subtly rendered.

Emilia, as depicted by Josephine
Unger, is another role that is dif-
ficult because of its duality. On one
side, she is close to Desdemona and
noble in her sentiments; on the oth-
er, she suggests Bianca, a jealous
and emotional courtesan. This some-
what split personality was a chal-
lenge to Miss Unger, but she met her
task admirably. As a woman of
worldly wit, with the looseness of
character that would become her
as the wife of an ambitious man,
Emilia was charming and refresh-
ing. As the woman of kind and noble
sentiments, she triumphed in her
vindication of Desdemona.

Fine Characterizations

There are three other characteri-
zations to which I should like to call
attention. The first is Brabantio, the
aged and broken father of Desde-
mona, whose wrath and bitterness
were fully and movingly depicted
by Jim Applebaum. Another memo-
rable role was that of Lodovico,
played by Andy Leonard. His ap-
pearance in the final scenes as the
noble statesman, whom fate charged
with the role of mediator after
the catastrophe of the play, was su-
perlative.

The third characterization I wish
to comment on is that of Bianca;
Jeanne Tracy is to be praised for
two reasons: one is that she took
over in this role only last week; the
second is that she brought the most
successful and delightful scenes of
comic relief into the play. The part
is extremely short; Miss Tracy’s
treatment of it is unforgettable.

The minor speaking and non-
speaking roles were more than ade-
quately filled. These people pos-
sessed a naturalness for the most
part, that is sometimes hard to feel
when the character supports, more
than he participates in, the main
stream of the tragedy. This ap-
plies especially to Andy Adelson, as
the aged Duke of Venice; Terry
Van Brunt, as the youthful govern-
or of Cyprus, Montano; and to Gay
Reading, as the brother of Braban-
tio, Gratiano, an old man who was
characterized by deliberation if not
affectation in his role.

Admirably supporting the rest of
the cast were Jack Crissman, Peter
Stelling, and Bill McKin as the sen-
ators, Tim O’Keefe as the Messen-
ger, and Jerry Gray, Gregory Mc-
Nab, and Charles Bright as the gen-
tlemen, Lance Tarrance, Franco de
Battaglia, Tilghman Broaddus, Dan
Friedman, Alan Lanham, and Phil
Oliver as the officers, servants and
attendants.

As the first impact of this per-
formance settles in my mind, I think
back to a passage in John Mase-
field’s William Shakespeare. In talk-
ing about the people of the Shakes-
pearean plays, he said that they
“are alive and hearty. They lead a
vigorous life and go to bed tired.
They never forget that they are
animals. They never let anyone else
forget that they are also divine.” It
migh seem egotistical, but it is sure-
ly the tribute deserved by all of
those who worked to give us this
production of Othello.

Jaycee Spring Sports Show

Will Feature

Bob Davies

Bob Davies, a member of the basketball Hall of Fame and
of the six greatest basketball players of all time, according
to a recent poll of coaches sponsored by Sport Magazine, will
be among a galaxy of stars who will participate in the Valley
Youth Fitness and Sport Show April 13-14, according to
Capt. Frank Walter, chairman of the Jaycee sponsored project.

Davies will be in Lexington to*¥

conduct a basketball clinic on Sat-
urday morning, April 14. The clinic,
open to participation by high school
players and coaches in the District 5
and Valley District area, will be held
in the VMI Fieldhouse from 9:30
a.m. to noon.

An All-American at Seton Hall,
Davies was a star of the Rochester
Royals of the National Basketball
Association and is generally recog-
nized as the greatest of basketball’s
“little men.”

Named to the NBA all-star team
several times, the basketball expert
scored more than 1,000 points dur-
ing three different seasons and cap-
tained Rochester in four campaigns.
As head coach of Seton Hall basket-
ball (1946-47), his team compiled a
24-3 record.

 

Placement

The following companies will have
representatives on campus during
the week of March 19 to 23 to inter-
view seniors who may be interested
in careers with their organizations.
Tuesday, March 20—The Upjohn

Company

Mr. Lynn H. Ledden will visit
our campus in the afternoon only to
interview men who may be inter-
ested in a career with a future in
Pharmaceutical Sales.

 

The purpose of the clinic is to
promote interest in basketball and
to simplify teaching methods so that
younger players, as well as seasoned
veterans, can derive the most from
the game, Capt. Walter said. Davies
will demonstrate and explain basket-
ball shooting in detail, as well as
passing, dribbling, pivoting, offense
and defense.

The Valley Youth Fitness and
Sport Show is an annual project of
the Lexington-Rockbridge Junior
Chamber of Commerce. The first
such event last year garnered the
top award as the outstanding sport
show in Virginia and as one of the
top three such events held nation-
ly.

Over five-thousand people were
attracted to the multi-event pro-
gram last year and the Jaycees are
expecting an even larger tournout
this year.

Davies will be but one of a num-
ber of prominent sports personalities
who will be on hand for the two-
day spectacular.

| Visitors Play

Here On Wed.

Washington and Lee University | |

will play host to an All-Australian
lacrosse team for four days next
week.

The 27-man team—on an 11-game] | oe

tour of the United States—will be
on the W&L campus
through Thursday. W&L’s Generals
will clash with the Aussies in a
match at 4 p.m. Wednesday on Wil-
son Field.

The Australians’ first game was
scheduled at Duke Thursday, and
the second contest will be Satur-
day in Charlottesville against the
University of Virginia. The Victoria
squad is the first Australian lacrosse
team to play in the United States.

A round of activities has been
planned for the “team from down
under.” Washington and Lee’s 18
social fraternities will entertain
team members at evening meals
Monday and Tuesday in the frater-
nity houses. A post-game banquet,
set for 7 p.m. Wednesday, will be
for both W&L and the Australian
teams. Richard B. Sessoms, sports
information director at Virginia Mil-
itary Institute, will be the principle
speaker for the evening.

On tap also are tours of nearby
Natural Bridge and _ neighboring
VMI. Morning practice sessions are
scheduled Tuesday and Wednesday.

The Aussies will travel from Lex-
ington to College Park for their
fourth match with the University of
Maryland on March 24.

Tickets for the match may be ob-
tained at McCrum’s Drug Store, the
Southern Inn, Pres Brown’s or by
calling the W&L Director of Inter-
collegiate Athletics at HObart 3-
2181, Extension 227.

W&L information director Frank
Parsons has some interesting statis-
tics on the Australian lacrosse team
that meets the Generals on March
21.

The average age of the team is 26
years. The oldest player is 39; the
youngest is 18.

Occupations of the players range
from land surveyor to stock ex-
change operator to a motor mer-
chant to a wholesale jeweller.

Here’s a typical rundown on one
of the Aussie All-Stars:

Keith Atkins, goal-keeper. He’s 29,
stands 5’9” and weighs 203 pounds.
He was named the “Best and Fair-
est” in Australia in 1957.

That’s just a sampling of the com-
petition the Generals will be meet-
ing.

Washburn began practice March 24.

Globetrotters
Here Tonight
At VMI Gym

“Relax, man, relax!”

That’s the war cry of Meadow-
lark Lemon, six foot, three inch hu-
man jumping jack of the Harlem
Globetrotters, who oppose the Wash-
ington Generals in the professional
basketball feature of a triple-bar-
reled jamboree at the VMI Field-
house tonight.

A musical variety show directed
by and starring Cab Calloway and
a table tennis match will round out
the program starting at 7:30.

Lemon, a funloving fellow who
consistently outjumps and outdoes
men many inches taller and pounds
heavier, credits his ability to keep
relaxed, or “loose,” with whatever
success he has enjoyed as the Trot-
ter’s Clown Prince and hot shot
scorer.

Some of the secret of Meadow-
lark’s success as a rebounder, he
concedes, is due to a fantastic 84-
inch arm-spread. His comedy capers
are uniquely his own, and many of
them are ad libbed as the game pro-
gresses.

A lightning fast table tennis match
between English Champion Richard
Bergmann and Africa’s 23-year old
contender for the world’s cham-
pionship, Emmanual Quaye, will be
a feature of the evening according
to Abe Saperstein, who brings the
Globetrotters to Lexington.

Lyles has begun to shape up his

Starting Lineup
If he had to pick a starting line-

Chuck Lane at third, Ned Hobbs at

Springfield

Next week, Springfield College’s
baseball team moves into Lexington
for a seven-day practice session,
during which time they’ll scrimmage
against the Generals and VMI.

Springfield, one of the nation’s
top baseball powers, has been in
the College World Series for the past
two years.

The reason for their migration to
Lexington is that bad weather in
Massachusetts prevents them from
getting in pre-Spring vacation prac-
tice.

Baseball Team Practicing
Outside; Prospects Good

Washington and Lee’s varsity baseballers moved outside
this week for extensive drills on defensive strategy, and coach
i] Joe Lyles was pleased with the results.

“We've just had five days outside this year,” he said. “But
that’s better than the last two years. We’re looking pretty good

 

With the annual spring vacation®
7| baseball trip only two weeks away,

 

including wins over West Virginia
and Dartmouth.

Lyles admits that defensively he
couldn’t ask for much more.

Strong Defensively

“We're going to be plenty strong
in the field, and our hitters are
good enough,” he said. “Everything
depends on the pitching.”

Pitching is without a doubt the
biggest question facing Lyles this
year. Gone is Roy Carpenter, the
mainstay of the W&L staff for the
three years, who got five of the
eight General wins last year.

Lyles, however, has seven pitchers
on hand this spring, and hopes that
together they can make up for the
gap left by Carpenter’s departure.

Sophomore Brice Gamber, law
student Phil Sharpe, and senior
Rosie Page will draw the biggest
share of pitching assignments, with
help from Louie Paterno and Jim
Gwinn.

Gamber, an all-state selection in
his high school, came around well
at the end of last year, putting in
at least two excellent pitching per-
formances for the Generals.

Sharpe is a three-year veteran
with considerable experience, as is
Page, who'll probably be Lyles’
number one reliever.

Paterno, who won acclaim in West
Virginia in baseball as well as
basketball, is one of the best pros-
pects in years, according to Lyles,
and will be used extensively not
only as a pitcher but also in the
defensive lineup.

Incomes in the South Said To Be On the Rise

(Continued from page 2)

where money is being spent.

This process typifies the circular
reality that one of the greatest
stimulants to industrial expansion is
a little industrial expansion. This is
the justification of the subsidies and
concessions that so many southern
communities are willing to make to
get “that first industry.” Also, con-
sciousness of market growth as the
foundation for much industrializa-
tion re-enforces awareness that a
new market creates new firms or a
new capacity that requires a loca-
tion decision.

The Low Wage Argument

The most frequently heard reason
for plants expanding southward is
“low non-union wages.” Historical-
ly, labor has proved much more mo-
bile than industry and the cream of
southern labor has flowed north and
west seeking higher wages. Union
restrictions have slowed this pro-
cess down considerably, but has this
union activity been the deciding fac-
tor in southern industrialization?
While the classic example of the
textile industries that were drawn
South by a combination of wages,

raw materials, climate, and markets
is often cited, low wages present a
real dilemma to the southern busi-
ness man seeking industrial pro-
gress.

Industrialization is desirable for
two possible reasons. First, money
stops leaving the region to pay for
goods produced outside which have
been causing an intra-mural drain
on the region’s wealth, making it a
depressed area. Secondly, it is hoped
that products from local industry
will be sold outside the region,
bringing in outside money to be
spent locally, and stimulate the local
economy through consumption or
investment.

Low wages may draw industry
seeking to sell outside the region,
but low wages do not provide the
maximum stimulus or incentive to
industry to develop to supply the
local market. High wages provide a
stronger stimulus for local market-
oriented economic activity, but less
advantage for industry selling out-
side the region. The ideal attitude
for the southern industrialist selling
on the southern market is to want
everybody else’s wages to go up
faster than his own, thus giving him
an expanding market with a cost
lag.

Per Capita Income Increases

Per capita income in the south-
eastern states has risen from about
50 per cent of the national average
in 1930 to almost 75 per cent in 1961.
World War II brought much of this.
Also, during the last decade the
population growth of the South has
exceeded the national rate and there
has been a change in the trend from
emigration to immigration.

While the wage differential still
exists between the South and north-
ern areas, it is partially illusionary.

Comparisons within the same indus-
try show wage differentials, but with
automation and growing markets,
Houston may be chosen as the loca-
tion for a metal-working plant al-
though Boston, Baltimore, and Min-
neapolis have one to three per cent
lower wage levels in that industry,
and Philadelphia and New York
City only two per cent higher.

The growing market and the rap-
idly growing urban and industrial
facilities seem to have demonstrated
their ability to support southern
economic growth, and _ displaced
southern farm labor is now migrat-
ing to southern cities instead of
northern ones. Once the markets and
facilities start growing, local capital
as well as outside capital is fed
into local investments, and the ur-
banization and industrialization pro-
cess becomes self-sustaining.
Mental Factors Hinder Development
The gross statistics of the past
decade seem to indicate that the
South’s economy is coming of age
and that tremendous potential is be-
ing balanced by an accumulation of
retarding forces. In the words of the
director of a recently announced re-
search project for the Twentieth
Century Fund on southern develop-
ment, “In addition to these handi-
caps (referring to the low wage
nature of much southern industry),
the South pays a heavy price for an
inherited set of psychological at-
titudes and cultural values which
impose serious handicaps to the full
and efficient use of much of its man-
power.”

McCormick Library Sees
Growth in All Directions:
Circulation, Size & Budget

Figures released yesterday by Li-
brarian Henry Coleman reveal
marked increase in the circulation,
budget, and size of the library.

The number of reference inquiries
has jumped from 69 to 102 a year
Circulation has risen from 22,061 to
29,126. Correspondingly, the size of
the library has grown from 172,217
to 181,633 books.

Book and magazine purchases
have risen from 1,958 books and 448
magazine subscriptions in 1957, to
2526 books and 510 magazines in
1961. They have also increased this
year.

Books purchased in the US are
bought from Camel and Hall, the
biggest book supply company in the
world. Foreign publications are pur-
chased in London, Paris, Berlin,
Madrid, and Florence.

$21,000 For 1962

The allocated budget of the Li-
brary to meet book and periodical
purchases has been enlarged from
$16,000 for the last four school
years to $18,000 in 1961, and $21,000
in 1962. Understandably, all related
figures have proportionately in-
creased.

Increased Use And Size

This increased use and size of the
library is far greater than that
which would be expected from the
slight increase in enrollment. Uni-
versity Librarian Coleman explains
this paradox by reasoning on the su-
periority of the students now at
W&L. “Students want to do read-
ing and research on their own now.
In the past,” he said, “students only
used the required books and those
on the various reading lists.”

spect, but as a means of accommo-
dating the curiosity of his fellows
and thereby gaining acceptance. It
is my experience that this is com-
mon practice for most Washington
and Lee men (a species to which, I
hasten to add, I at no times deny be-
longing). Also characteristic of oth-
er-directedness is the wide-spread
practice of “dumping on” girls. Since
the typical W&L depends in this in-
stance on the approval of his peers,
and not any innate sense of gentle-
manly abstraction, he can “dump”
because his peers do often approve.

Other-directedness promotes co-
operation as opposed to competition;
and this can be seen illustrated by
the phenomenon of “poor mouth-
ing,’ whereby a student who re-
ceives a higher grade than his fel-
lows will lie—perhaps “distort”
would be a better word in view of
certain circumstances—and down-
grade his mark to the average. Be-
ing “one of the guys” cannot be
denied as an important goal among

W&L men (as where isn’t it?) and
this may perhaps account for the
continued attraction of the “gentle-
man C.”

Other-directed American society
is also noted for the seriousness with
which it approaches its recreational
activity. There are those who will
dispute the contention that combo
parties are essentially serious affairs,
but why should we refuse to accept
the implication that it actually is
hard work for them to reach the
goal of intoxication when students
refer to themselves as “serious
drinkers”?

Finally, the nature of the typical
W&L man’s response to politics
parallels almost exactly that of the
typical other-directed American at
large. The W&L voter is knowledge-
able but indifferent, believing that
he can do nothing to affect or alter
the political situation. He is con-
cerned far more with personalities
than with constitutions and institu-
tional functionings, and especially
with the sincerity of candidates
rather than their ability. Perhaps
this is one reason for the lack-luster
response given to the proposed
Student Senate, which would add
more men to the top echelon of stu-
dent government and thereby in-
crease or create impersonality.

In short, I think that it is more
than reasonable to conclude, for
better or for worse, that the W&L
student body is an other-directed
society.
