IT’S VARSITY SCHOLARS VS. POMONA

 

Student Views
On Committee

Are Skeptical

An inquiry into student
body opinion this week reveal-
ed that many students do not
know what the newly-created
Student Disciplinary Commit-
tee is and that most of them

do not know much about it.

When questioned, most students
registered shock for a moment; about
25 per cent had never heard of the
committee. Many others did not un-
derstand how the committee will
work or what it will do.

Although the majority of opinion
backed the idea of the committee,
some spoke against it. “It’s just
another committee; they have so
many committees around here now
you can’t think straight. I don’t see
what it can accomplish.”

Jay Clark saw a need for the
committee brought out by the re-
cent riots at UVa. “I think it will
serve well in a liaison capacity
between the student body and the
EC. It will handle cases which I
think should not be under the
jurisdiction of the EC or the
Administration,” he said.

Phil Sharp expressed hope for the
committee but opined that they had
a big job. “I believe that the IFC,
given the chance to handle Rush and
Hell Week, hasn’t done that very
well; and unless the Student Disci-
plinary Committee can proceed along
better lines than this student com-
mittee, I don’t think it will accom-
plish anything. The committee must
start off and keep a good strong
policy.”

“This is Washington and Lee stu-
dents’ chance to prove their matur-
ity, and I'll bet you they ball it up,”
commented Jack Andrews.

Jack Vardaman stated “I’m very
much in favor of students being able
to regulate student behavior. I be-
lieve this will be a satisfactory ex-
periment.”

“[’'m quite happy that the faculty
has displayed this confidence in
the student body, and hope that
the students can fulfill it. The stu-
dent body can make this commit-
tee work. All we need to do is get
a good committee,” said Dick Mc-
Enally.

Most students seem to be in fav-
or of the new committee but few

Dr. Taylor Cole, professor of po-
litical science from Duke Universi-
ty, last night told a Lee Chapel
audience that the constitution of
Nigeria, the fifteenth African state
to attain its independence, could well
set the precedent for future leader-
ship in Africa. The highly agrarian
state, though still plagued by lep-
rosy and sleeping sickness, is one of
the most modern of the newly arisen
nations and has greatly increased its
exports in its year of independence.

Most of the young leaders, many
between the ages of 35 and 45, either
attended schools in the U.S. or Bri-
tain, or were trained by Christian
missionaries. Seemingly the West
would have a big jump on Commun-
ism, but in 1959 when Dr. and Mrs.
Cole attended a series of debates in
Nigeria, “Is Benevolent Dictatorship
more applicable to Nigeria than
Parliamentry Democracy?”, the re-
sults were unfavorable to capital-
ism. In the debates, the dictatorships
of Russia and Red China were com-
pared and_ surprisingly enough,
China was unanimously preferred
because she has moved rapidly and
effectively to achieve her ends, with
no regard to the means of attain-
ment, and she is not white.

One of the major international
trade union confederations, known
to be Communistic, is now firmly
established in all regions of Nigeria

night, and Dr. Fred Cole, who is W&L’s president.

Of Nigeria Could Set Precedent

gun construction on their embassy
in Lagos. The U.S. government has
not given any sizeable amount of
aid to Nigeria but the Ford Founda-
tion and various other private agen-
cies have given much.

Dr. Cole remarked that the one-
party domination in each of the
three major regions apparently
would hamper the growth of federal-
ism. But, he said, many of the tribal
chiefs who were once afraid to look
to the center for guidance have
shown a trend towards increasing
unity.

The minorities in Nigeria, such as
the Christians in the Moslem North,
feel discriminated against and thus
turn to the federal government for
consolation. The psychological fac-
tors of a federal government, foreign
affairs and a defence program has
had a tremendous effect on this early
independent nation striving for a
strong feeling of nationalism.

Prior to the Nigerian Indepen-
dence in 1960, the government was
approached about sending troops to
the Congo and they replied, “We
will send troops when we are inde-
pendent, or not at all.”

Dr. Cole feels that in spite of Pan-
Africanism, “More than any any
other country south of the Sahara,
Nigeria offers possibilities of attain-
ment” of democratic goals similar to
our own.

 

Alumni Office Establishing File
On Old Grads’ Occupations

A poll of some 1,100 former Washington and Lee students
has been undertaken by the Alumni Association for establish-

New York Brass Quintet
Will Appear At VMI

On Monday, the New York Brass
Quintet will be heard in a concert
at 8:15 p.m. in Jackson Memorial
Hall at VMI.

This performance will be the sec-
ond event in the current season of
the Rockbridge Concert Theater
Series.

The New York Brass Quintet com-
prises two trumpets, horn, trombone,
and tuba. The instrumentalists are
all virtuoso musicians in their own
right and are led by Robert Nagel,
the first trumpeter of the group.

The Quintet has been a distin-
guished ensemble in the musical
life of the United States and Canada
for some seasons. In recent years
the group has toured the East, Mid-
west and Southwest and has been
heard twice in concerts at the Li-
brary of Congress.

The music performed by the group
is extremely varied in style and
ranges from early 16th and 17th cen-
tury pieces to compositions by living

kto the alumni requesting information
on their jobs, families, civic activi-
ties and honors, according to Mr.
William C. Washburn, the alumni
secretary.

Information obtained from the re-
turned forms will be compiled by
the University’s IBM data processing
system. Statistical information on
alumni will be available some time
after the start of the second se-
mester, Mr. Washburn said.

Planned for a Year

The occupational file, the first of
its kind for Washington and Lee,
has been in the planning stages for
more than a year. Cards and other
materials will be prepared by the
data processing staff here.

“We feel that Washington and Lee
can provide swift and accurate an-
swers to interested groups and in-
dividuals as a result of our new file,”
Mr. Washburn said. “We hope to
bring these files up to date period-
ically.”

Limited questionnaires have been
mailed to the alumni in previous
years, but the information has never
been coded for use by the University.

Debaters Off To Columbia
For South Carolina Meet

Washington and Lee’s varsity De-
bating Team left yesterday for the
South Carolina Invitational Tourna-
ment at Columbia, S. C.

Bill Noel, Al Eckes, Bill Boardman,
and Charles McCord are the debaters
making the trip with coach William
Chaffin. They will meet teams of
the caliber of Northwestern and
Army. It is the first trip for the var-
sity debaters this year.

Last weekend at Wake Forest,
W&L’s freshmen debaters won six
and lost six debates in a novice
tournament. Both negative and af-
firmative teams broke even in six
debates apiece.

Boulding Will
Talk On Ethics
And Capitalism

The first in a series of three
seminars in religion and eco-
nomics will get underway Tues-
day when a University of
Michigan professor will discuss
“Ethical Problems and Capital-
ist Development.”

Dr. Kenneth E. Boulding, pro-
fessor of economics at Michigan
will speak at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in
Lee Chapel. His second campus ap-
pearance will be Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. in the chapel when he will
speak on “Ethical Problems and
Socialist Development.”

The special seminars are being
held for the first time this year at
Washington and Lee in place of
the traditional weeklong University
Religious Conference. Other speak-
ers will appear on the campus in
February and April.

Dr. Boulding, a native of England,
received his bachelor of arts degree
with first class honors at Oxford
University. He came to the United
States in 1932 as a Commonwealth
Fellow at the University of Chi-
cago. He began his teaching career
two years later at the University
of Edinburgh but returned to this
country in 1937.

In 1949, he received the John Bates
Clark medal of the American Eno-
nomic Association. He is the author
of six books in the field of econom-
ics, a book of poetry and a book
on philosophy. He has contributed
chapters to two books on religion.

Dr. Boulding is active in the So-
ciety of Friends.

He taught at Colgate, Fisk, Iowa
State and McGill universities before
joining the University of Michigan
faculty in 1949.

 

Disciplinary
Members Will
Be Selected

The Executive Committee is asking
for applications trom the student
body for positions on the Student
Control Committee, a newly organ-
ized committee which will investi-
gate and take action on conduct of-
fenses which are brought to its at-
tention. Two seniors, one junior, one
sophomore, and one law student will
be appointed from these applications
to serve on the committee. The E.C.
urges all responsible students to
apply.

Uncas McThenia, president of the
Student Body, considers this com-
mittee “a step in self-government”
which places a great deal of re-
sponsibility on all students.” Be-
cause the committee will determine
whether more student stelf-discipline
is feasible,” he said. McThenia also
fels that on a student basis, repeat-
ed misconduct can better be averted
before it is carried too far.

*reigning Pomona scholars, and if the

Californians win, rules of the pro-
gram require them to retire as an
unbeaten king of the hill.

The Lexington school, making its
first appearence on the popular net-
work show, will place its hopes in
four bright young men who know
lots of facts and can recall them in
rapid fashion.

They are William R. Anderson,
Jr., Startex, S. C., senior; William
B. Lowry, Jr., Hobbs, N. M.,
junior; James M. Campbell, St.
Petersburgh, Fla., junior; and
Thomas M. Lybass, Jacksonville,
Fla., sophomore. Lowry will serve
as team captain.

All have scholarly interests, often
unrelated to their college majors.
Anderson is majoring in English,
Lowry in philosophy, Campbell in
German, and Lybass in European
History.

They were chosen from among
some 75 candidates who competed
for places on the team and the
weekend in New York that accom-
panies each appearance on the pro-
gram.

Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the
president, was in charge of the selec-
tion, and was subsequently named by
President Fred C. Cole to act as
official “coach” of the team.

Parsons first subjected team can-
candidates to a series of written
quizzes to test the breadth of their
knowledge. Then he had them com-
pete against one another in a ser-
ies of tests which required instan-
taneous oral answers. Extensive rec-
ords were kept, and the finalists
were chosen on the basis of tests
scores and general qualifications
which included their competitive
spirit and ability to react under
pressure.

Parsons says grades made in
classes were not considered in pick-
ing a team, although professors were
asked to recommend students they
considered likely to do well in a
test of knowledge calling for quick
recall of specific fact.

“Very often a candidate would be
an exceptional scholar, but would
lack the ability to think rapidly in
a competitive situation,” Parsons
pointed out. He added quickly that
all four Washington and Lee team
members are indeed good students.
Three—Anderson, Campbell, and
Lowry—hold academic scholarships.

“They all read a great deal, and
this is most important,” Parsons said.

Once the four members were de-
termined, practice sessions were
scheduled almost nightly. A buzzer
system, similar to the one used to
signal answers on the television pro-
gram, was installed in Parsons’ of-
fice, and the team worked long
hours on “buzzer reaction” to “toss-
up” questions.

They also worked on their team-
work in answering “bonus” ques-
tions where team members may con-
sult briefly with one another on the
answer.

Parsons says a supply of some
1,000 toss-up and bonus questions
similar to those asked on the show
was quickly exhausted. Professors
provided other questions, and Par-
sons used questions from a variety
of other sources.

Tape recordings of previous Col-
lege Bowl shows were played for
the team, to familiarize members
with the voice and general charac-
teristics of quizmaster Allen Ludden,

and the general format of the show.

Parsons believes the Washington
and Lee team can match the Pomona
team in general knowledge, but he
thinks the defending champions
will have a decided advantage in
experience and “camera presence.”

“If we lose, we can always fire

A Challenge

We were happy to see the plan for a student disciplinary
committee pass the faculty on Monday. We have heard nothing
but enthusiasm for the plan from the members of the faculty
and administration with whom we have talked lately. It shows
how much trust and respect the faculty is willing to give the
students.

 

But it is an idealistic plan, even on the limited basis upon
which it is being established at present. The future of student-
administered discipline will depend upon the maturity of judg-
ment of the men who are chosen to serve on the new committee.

We urge every student to consider the implications of the
new committee very carefully. The formation of such a group
was an important plank in the platform of the victorious Inde-
pendent Party in last springs elections. The new EC has match-
ed their deeds with their words. Now it is time for the student
body to support the men they have elected. We hope every in-
terested student will apply for a seat on the committee.

It will not be an exciting job, nor can the committee mem-
bers hope to be showered with thanks from their fellow stu-
dents. But we cannot think of a position in which a student
can be of more real service to the University. We desperately
need men who can play a creative role in the shaping of
student disciplinary policy. This is an opportunity the student
body can’t afford to pass up. If we fail, there will be no reason
for the later complaints about discipline.

‘The Five-Star Generals’

Washington and Lee’s College Bowl team goes into Sun-
day’s match against Pomona an underdog. The alert and exper-
ienced Pomona team is a heavy favorite to retire undefeated
from the competition. It will be quite an upset if we win. Come
Sunday though, we’ll be in front of our tubes rooting for the

‘*Five-A Generals.”

Who knows? If we meet with as much success in the College
Bowl as we have on the football field, maybe Higher Educa-
tion or The American Scholar will send a reporter down here
to check on our “program.”

This Walter Bingham of the academic world couldn’t
entitle his story “A Sport for Goof-offs.”” We'd have to drop
“subsidization” of scholars before we earned that title. Re-
member, three of the four College Bowl team members have
academic scholarships.

Dance Board vs. Faculty

Next week’s meeting between the faculty Committee on
Student Social Functions and a delegation from the Execu-
tive Committee may be able to find some workable solution for
the present impasse between the faculty committee and the
Dance Board. (See the adjacent column for the background
on this meeting.)

We respect and admire the faculty committee’s detailed in-
terest in the conduct of the University dance sets, but we feel
they are placing an unnecessary and undesirable pressure on
the Dance Board to maintain the existing pattern on dance
weekends.

We ourselves would not like to see the decorum and formal-
ity which is left even now in the big dances disappear entirely.
But the Dance Board is under a number of very demanding
pressures which make it difficult for the Board to give the stu-
dent subscribers their money’s worth and satisfy the faculty’s
preference in social events at the same time.

To wit:

It is becoming more difficult to hire top-notch performers at
a price we can afford.

Bands that used to cost $2500 are now asking $5000. Re-
cordings, television, and a large student population have vastly
increased the demand for the musicians we want to hear at
WeL.

The dances, as they are set up now, just don’t have any
attraction for most students. This is a manifestation of chang-
ing tastes and we forgo speculation about the reasons, but the
fact remains. We have to live with it.

The reason students buy dance plans at all is the con-
certs. Remember the Dance Board advertisements: “You
save on the price of concerts alone.”” Anyone who is uncon-
vinced has only to compare the attendance at the concerts with
the attendance at the dances to realize this is true.

The Dance Board needs a free hand in arranging the events
of the dance weekends. They cannot give the student body
the most for its money when they are restricted to the present
pattern. We hope the faculty committee will be able to find
some formula for performing its responsibility to the Univer-
sity without placing such a heavy hand on the Dance Board’s
operations.

We know Dr. Cook and the members of his faculty com-
mittee to be an able and understanding group of men. We be-
lieve Mr. Galef, Mr. Young, and the members of the Dance
Board to be an able and responsible group of young men.
But when the students fork over some $20,000 of their own
money for dance sets, we think they ought to be able to decide
what they want to do with it with only broad limits set by
the faculty.

 

Exodus Is
Evidence Of
Poor Parties

By STEVE HENRY

What this campus needs is a good
party.

If you don’t believe it, just take
a look at the number of cars taking
off for North Carolina Germans this
weekend.

Our memory may be failing, but
it seems to us that this is the first
time in recent years that the Wash-
ington and Lee student body has
felt it necessary to make such a
mass exodus to neighboring parties.

Last week it was the University
of Virginia; this week, North Caro-
lina.

The explanation for this phenom-
enon is relatively easy to explain,
We just haven’t had any parties this
fall.

As a matter of fact, this fall has
been the worst party season in many
a year at W&L. With the exception
of Openings Dances, this place has
been as dead as the proverbial dodo.

And everybody knows what boys
do when they want something they
can’t get. They go out and find it,
even if they have to drive all the
way to Carolina to get it.

This, of course is a tragic situation,
and one that needs a solution.

First, let us look at why the prob-
lem has arisen.

In the past, the period from the
opening of school until Christmas
vacation has been the best party
season of all. Not including the
Christmas parties thrown before va-
cation, we used to have at least four
good weekends—combo weekends,
drinking weekends. You know what
we mean.

Openings was a party; Homecom-
ings was a party, and every other
home football game was a party, too.
Those were the good old days.

How sad it is to review the events
of the past three months.

We have had only one good week-
end, the combination Openings-
Homecomings festivities, which ad-
mittedly was a great party, but last-
ed only two days. We have had no
other organized weekend since then.

There have been three home foot-
ball games so far. One was sche-
duled so close to the opening of
school that no one could get or-
ganized quickly enough to have a
party.

One was Homecomings-Openings.

The third was during Parents’
Weekend, which naturally squelch-
ed any possibility of a party week-
end.

So we hvae already blown two
out of three party opportunities this
year, and have blown them through
no fault of our own. Circumstances
were against our partying this fall.

All this leads to the obvious ques-
tion: was all this coincidence planned
long beforehand by the powers-that-
be with an eye toward cutting out,
or at least diminishing, the W&L
party life?

It is a distinct possibility that this
is true. If so, there are bleak years
ahead, party-wise.

However ,all is not lost. Take
heart!

A few more good horror shows
like the one at UVa. last weekend,
and the other schools will be throw-
ing parties for us in Lexington just
to keep us away from their parties.

By BILL ROBERTS
Friday Editor

A meeting that will take place
next week, between the faculty
Committee on Student Social Func-
tions and a delegation from the stu-
dent body Executive Committee,
may have a decisive effect on the

future of the big dance sets.

After the faculty committee had,
reluctantly, approved the Dance
Board’s request for informal dress
at the Saturday night dance Open-
ings weekend, the EC asked for a
meeting with the faculty group for
a general discussion of the dance
sets. Briefly, this is the situation:

The faculty committee has the re-
sponsibility, and the right, to super-
vise student social functions. The
Dance Board has been referring any
proposals it had for changes in the
makeup and conduct of the dance
weekends to the committee.

In the past few years, there have
been quite a few such proposals,
prompted by the Dance Board’s de-
sire to shore up lagging attendance
at the dances in the gym. Last
spring’s omission of the Saturday
night dance and the ruling on in-
formal dress at Openings are the
most recent examples.

Here’s the rub—the Dance Board
has never come across with a re-
quest to the Committee that the
whole pattern of the dance weekend
(formal dance Friday night, con-
cert Saturday afternoon, informal
dance Saturday night) be revised.
Instead they have asked for their

Faculty-EC Meeting Next Week On Dance Sets

changes each time with the under-
standing they would be “just for
this once.” The faculty committee,
which is as unhappy as anyone about
the declining interest in the big
dances, hasn’t liked this method.
They haven’t been sure the Dance
Board was acting in good faith.
Some members of the committee
have rather strongly opposed the
changes which have come up. Tem-
pers have been rubbed very thin
on both sides.

What the EC hopes to do is clear
up the present confusion and see
where everybody stands. It is no
secret that there are quite a few
people in the faculty and adminis-
tration who think that having fra-
ternity combos and a big dance at
school at the same time is a waste
of money. Some of them would like
to rule out fraternity combos when
there is a dance at school. Others
would just as soon abolish the dance
weekends.

It is also no secret that the Dance
Board would like to have more free-
dom to arrange the events on big
weekends. They don’t like having
to submit every change they want
in the present pattern to the faculty
committee. It has been a trying job
for the Dance Board presidents to
try and satisfy both the students and
faculty, who apparently have widely
divergent social function tastes.

What the meeting can do is bring
out the true difference of opinion.
Only then can a mutually satisfac-
tory system be worked out.

 

Page And Wood
In Berlin Debate

The Forensic Union heard a de-
bate between Rosie Page and Robin
Wood Wednesday on the subject,
“Resolved, the United States stand
on the Berlin crisis was not firm
enough.”

Page, arguing the affirmative, told
the 35 members present that the
United States had been “too late
with too little” in response to the
Communist threat to the German
city. Page summarized the develop-
ments in Berlin and pointed out that
the U.S. might have been able to
stop the building of the wall be-
tween the Eastern and Western sec-
tors of Berlin if this nation had
shown the Communists earlier that
“we mean business.” He argued that
the U.S. cannot let the Russians
push us around and that we must
stand and fight for what we believe.

Wood supported his stand for the
negative by pointing out the dangers

of using too much force in the is-|}

sue. If physical force were used, he
warned the Club that World War
II might be started.

Wood suggested that Berlin be
put under UN control until a for-
mal peace is signed and Germany is
unified. He cited the opinions of
some contemporary historians who
are favorable to this plan.

He concluded by stating that Ber-
lin does not represent the proper
place nor the present the proper time
to start a war.

 

Delta Theta Phi Pledges 6

Six law students pledged Delta
Theta Phi legal fraternity last week.
DTP is the second largest legal fra-
ternity in the United States. It had
been inactive on this campus until
two years ago.

Those men pledging were: Larry
Lambert, Norfolk, Va.; Preston Lan-
easter, Farmville, Va.; Mal Lassman,
Brooklyn, N. Y.; Lewis Leigh, Chan-
tilly, Va.; Leonard Sargeant, Mt.
Holly Va.; and Tony Verdream,

Frosh To Hear Sigma Nu
Executive Secretary

Richard Fletcher, Executive Sec-
retary of Sigma Nu, has been asked
by the IFC to speak before the
freshmen pledges on Thursday.

Mr. Fletcher will speak on the
functions of fraternities in campus
life. “The IFC feels that the talk
will give pledges a clearer under-
standing of what their relationship
and attitude should be toward their
fraternities,” stated IFC chairman
Bob Doenges.

Mr. Fletcher has held his posi-
tion with Sigma Nu for five years
and prior to that he worked on the
admissions staff at the University of
Virginia for 19 years. He has also
had experience in journalism and
newspaper work.

The speech will be held in Lee
Chapel at 7 o’clock and all freshmen
are required to attend.

From The EC:
Student Control
Explanation

(Editor’s note—The Executive
Committee released a statement
yesterday on the newly-approved
student disciplinary committee.
The full text appears below.)

The Executive Committee wishes
to express its appreciation publicly
to the Faculty and Administration
for approval of the proposals re-
lating to student conduct.

The recommendation for estab-
lishment of the Student Control
Committee was presented to the
faculty after much discussion by the
Executive Committee and the Ad-
ministrative committee. The request
was made by the Executive Com-
mittee because it is believed that
the student body is willing to as-
sume greater responsibility in the
area of student conduct. In the past
many students have expressed a
strong desire to have student control
in matters of discipline. No longer
are complaints justified that the stu-
dents have no voice in conduct af-
fairs.

The philosophy underlying the
establishment of this group is not
that students will mete out a less
severe punishment than the pres-
ent administrative committee, but
rather to provide a wider range of
student government and to illus-
trate the belief that students are
capable of being treated as mature
citizens. As students exercise total
jurisdiction over matters involv-
ing honor now, it is only another
sign of maturity to exercise con-
trol over other matters of social
conduct.

It is envisioned that this committee
will be more of a preventive than a
corrective body. There are instances
of minor offenses which arise and
are not reported to the present ad-
ministrative committee because they
are not sufficiently serious to merit
disciplinary action. However, after
several such offenses occur and a
student is only then brought before
the Administrative Committee the
results might be severe indeed. If
such matters were dealt with as they
arise it is believed that more serious
consequences might be prevented.

The areas of operation of the Stu-
dent Control Committee will be both
to investigate any reported violation
of gentlemanly conduct, and to ad-
minister any necessary punishment
for the same. If a complaint is re-
ceived from the University proctor,
from the Executive Committee, or
from any nearby school, this com-
mittee will be charged with full re-
sponsibility for dealing with the
matter.

The action of this group will be
subject to review by the Dean of
Students. If he thinks the Com-
mittee has acted unwisely he may
refer the case to the Administra-
tive Committee. Powers of dismis-
sal are not granted to the student
committee, but such a recommen-
mendation may be made to the
Dean of Students if the commit-
tee feels this punishment is war-
ranted.

No formal rules have been formu-
lated for this committee’s operation
because it is believed that each case
must be considered on an individual
basis. Any attempt to formulate a
set of rules or specific penalties for
certain offenses would be doomed to
failure. The present Administrative
Committee has never attempted to
act under any crystallized set of
rules.

If each individual case is con-
sidered with its peculiar attendant
circumstances as fair play and jus-
tice would require it is believed that
a more mature solution would re-
sult.

The Executive Committee would
like to emphasize that the faculty
action giving the student body juris-
diction in this area places a very
great responsibility on the students
of Washington and Lee. It is the
belief of the Executive Committee
that the student body is willing to
meet this challenge.

The opportunity has been provid-
ed for a voice in conduct affairs. It
is hoped that many students will
take a serious interest in this area
of student government for it pro-
vides an apportunity to render an
extremely worthwhile service to the
University.

Applications for positions on the
Student Control Committee are
being received by Steve Suttle,
Secretary of the Student Body,
Delta Tau Delta Fraternity. It is
urged that these applications be
submitted before Thanksgiving.

The Executive Committee sincere-
ly hopes that all applicants are aware
of the extreme careful and mature
deliberation which membership on
the Student Control Committee must
necessarily require.

Sports Editorial
Apology To H-S

Hampden-Sydney students and alumni are reportedly up-
set by a remark attributed to a Washington and Lee faculty
member in the recent Sports Illustrated article on the W&L
athletic system.

Speaking of the 1954 de-emphasis of football, a faculty
member is quoted as saying, ‘“The students were embarrassed
to have schools like Hampden-Sydney as opponents.”

We can see how this remark might be construed as an in-
sult. The title of the article was “A Sport for Gentlemen.”
Washington and Lee is called “a gentleman’s university,’ and
there is a pointed reference to “Washington and Lee types.”
After all this, the remark might easily be interpreted to mean
that it is beneath the dignity of Washington and Lee “gentle-
men” to compete with students from Hampden-Sydney.

We feel sure, however, that it was the intention of neither
the faculty member or the reporter to cast aspersions on the
character of Hampden-Sydney men. The remark referred
soly to the painful transition from big-time football to ama-
teur football.

The remark, far from discrediting Hampden-Sydney, rath-
er reflects the unhealthy atmosphere here at Washington and
Lee before desubsidization. One would have to have a very
distorted sense of values to be “embarrassed” to play Hamp-
den-Sydney when we had been playing the big football mills in

hurt our own reputation.

 

Frosh Basketball Hopefuls
Begin Pre-Season Practice

Washington and Lee will field a
“typical” freshman basketball team
this winter, says frosh coach Joe
Lyles, who as usual faces a rugged
15-game schedule with a squad lack-
ing adequate height for college ball.

Thirty-four candidates turned out
for opening drills Monday night, but
the average height of these 34 is
only 5’10”—a woefully short aver-
age for a college basketball team.

Lyles made his first cut Thursday
night reducing his squad to 25 men
at the present. Another cut will be
made later.

Hustle

“We’re hurting for height,” says
Lyles. “Our biggest man is 6’3” and
only a handful are over 6’.”

“There’s a lot of ability this year,
but it’s mostly at the guards,” he
added. “We’ve got so many good
men at the guards that its hard
to make any decisions this early.”

“What we've got so far is a lot of
hustle and enthusiasm. We’re going
to have to keep it.”

Kowalski, Livingston

Two boys whom Lyles is banking
on for strong front-line play are
6’3” Jerry Kowalski, and 6’2” Dick
Livingston.

Kowalski is the brother of Ken
Kowalski, a starter for last year’s
varsity Generals. A good rebounder,
Jerry shoots adequately from the
corners and operates well around

the backboard.

Livingston moves to Washington
and Lee after a fine senior year at
Fishburne Military School, where he
led the FMS squad in scoring. In
two outings against the Washington
and Lee freshmen last year, Livings-
ton hit for over 20 points.

Another forward who has looked
good so far is George Madison, who
played his high school basketball
for Bastrop (La.), where he was an
all-district first team choice his sen-
ior year.

Lyles has an abundance of ade-
quate backcourt performers ready
to go this year.

He named No Leigh, Scott Ver-
non, Girard Jolyn, and Vic Nunan

With the I-M Football Program
drawing to a close, the bowling
and wrestling leagues have com-
pleted their first week of action.
Bowling is held every Tuesday night,
while wrestling takes place on both
Tuesday and Thursday.

On November 7, four bowling
contests were held. Pi Phi, Phi Kap,
and Beta all won their matches easi-
ly. Pi Phi downed their counterparts
from KA 3-1, while the bowlers from
Beta House defeated Lambda Chi
also by 3-1.

In the first match of the evening
Sigma Chi played the representa-
tives from the Law School to a
2-2 draw. The post-grads had the
higher pin total—2108 to 2089.

Completely overpowering its op-
ponents, Phi Kap easily downed an
unbalanced ZBT unit 4-0. Jim Brus-
sard led the victors with games of
159, 171, and 189.

For ZBT Vic Galef was out-
standing as he had a 188 average
for the night. Vic is considered one
of the best bowlers enrolled in W&L
in a number of years.

Sewanee Biggest Test
On Generals’ Schedule

Washington and Lee meets Se-| of two All-Americans at Tennessee,

wanee Saturday in what has to be
the biggest game of the season for
both teams.

For one things, both teams are

‘| undefeated in the current campaign,

Washington and Lee with a record
of 6-0, Sewanee with a mark of
5-0-1.

For another, Sewanee was the last
team to beat the Generals, squeez-
ing out a 15-14 win in fog and rain
in mid-November in 1959. The Gen-
erals went on to win their last game
of the 1959 season, and except for
a tie at mid-season last year, they
have been all-victorious since.

If the Generals win or tie at
Sewanee Saturday, it will give
Washington and Lee a new school
record of 17 games without a loss,
bettering a mark which was fashion-
ed in 1914-15.

But the aspect of the contest that
just might move the Generals to
their best efforts is the prospect of
providing Coach Lee McLaughlin
with a win that will bring his col-
lege coaching ledger at all even at
19-19-2 in his fifth season. It will
be recalled that McLaughlin was
1-15 after two years in the business.

Last year, the Generals pasted the
Tigers a good one, winning 32-8
at Wilson Field. McLaughlin isn’t
letting his boys think much about
the ease of that one, for he said at
the time that the young Sewanee
team would be tough to handle in
1961.

Shirley Majors, the nationally
famed coach of the Tigers, has made
a prophet of McLaughlin. The father

 

Majors has No. 4 son playing an
important tailback spot for Sewanee’s
powerful single wing offense. And
the rest of the Tiger squad is ex-
perienced and talented, scout Buck
Leslie reports.

“This could very well be our
toughest game,” McLaughlin points
out. “Sewanee may not have the
physical strength that Emory and
Henry possessed, but it looks as
though they are capable of putting
more points on the scoreboard.”

The two teams have faced three
common opponents. Sewanee de-
feated Hampden-Sydney, 21-9, Ran-
dolph-Macon, 21-0, and Centre, 41-
0. The Generals have won over
Hampden-Sydney, 7-6, Randolph-
Macon, 48-0, and Centre, 53-0.

McLaughlin is quick to discount
any edge comparative scores might
give the Generals. “We've been very
fortunate in our scoring offorts,”
he says. “We've gotten some points
on our own, but our opponents have
given us plenty of help.”

The Generals’ Doug Martin, a
155-pound fullback, has moved up
to his accustomed place as leading
rusher. Last year as a first unit
man, Martin gained 619 yards at 6.9
a carry. This year, he runs on the
second unit and has accumulated
216 yards at 6.5 a carry. In W&L’s
win over Centre, Martin carried only
twice, but they were touchdown
scampers of eight and 24 yards. He
leads all W&L scorers with 38 points.

Injuries have made their first
appreciable dent in the W&L squad

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Frosh Offense Is Shaping Up;
First Touchdown Of Year Made

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team finally demonstrated
its offense last week after four un-
successful attempts.

The Baby Generals tallied their
first touchdown of the season on a
70-yard sustained drive, the last
seven yards being covered by a
pass from quarterback Sam Simp-
son to halfback Bill David. Despite
their newly-found offensive muscles,
the Baby Generals lost their fifth
straight game, a 28-7 decision to
Fork Union Military Academy.

Freshman coach Dana Swan, who
is very enthusiastic over his team’s
offensive showing last week, says:
“I think our offense will continue to
jell and do bigger and better things.”

The object of these “bigger and
better things” is Greenbrier Military
School, which meets the Baby Gen-
erals Friday on Wilson Field here.

Greenbrier, third in the Virginia
Military League, specializes in strong
end sweeps and outside and inside
belly runs on offense. They aren’t
afraid to pass if necessary and pos-
sess what Swan describes as “a
pretty potent” quick pass.

Swan points out that Greenbrier
uses a sort of pro type defense
which may bother his boys.

“Greenbrier moves its middle
guard in the slot between guard
and center and gives you the run-
ning play at him,” Swan said. “This
defense and Greenbrier’s good ag-
gressive, fast line could cause us
considerable trouble, unless we can
adjust.”

The old injury problem is still
plaguing the Baby Generals. Swan
says his squad is down to 21 or 22
players now. End Bob Dyer was
sidelined Monday when he broke his
hand.

Although Fork Union slapped

W&L rather hard, Swan has nothing
but praise for his boys.

“There wasn’t a man on the team
who didn’t do something good
against Fork Union,” he said.

Swan especially complimented end
John Molyneaux, who took over the
punting when regular punter Doug
Davis separated his shoulder against
Chowan Jr. College two weeks ago.

“Molyneaux’s punting was terri-
fic,” Swan said. “He averaged 38
yards a punt, kicking the ball be-
tween the opponents’ chins, legs and
just everywhere.”

After Greenbrier, the Baby Gen-
erals have one game remaining—a
Nov. 17 clash with Staunton Military
Academy here.

losses was to tournament champ
Pittsburgh.

Generals Meet Swanee
(Continued from page 3)

this year. Lost for the Sewanee
game are second unit tackle Phil
McCaleb with a leg injury and sec-
ond unit end Lanny Butler with
cracked ribs.

The easy win over Centre en-
abled McLaughlin to rest his bruised
first and second units for all but
ten minutes of the contest. He hopes
the respite will make the Blue and
Red teams eager for work against
Sewanee.

The Generals play Frederick Col-
lege here next Saturday. After
Frederick, only a Thanksgiving Day
game with Washington University
remains on the 1961 schedule.

The freshmen open their 1961

POVERTY CAN BE FUN

It is no disgrace to be poor. It is an error, but it is no disgrace.

So if your purse is empty, do not skulk and brood and hide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly and all kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blossom Sigafoos.

Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Eastern girls’
college, was smart as a whip and round as a dumpling, and
scarcely a day went by when she didn’t get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men’s schools. But Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Blossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only
by her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer as slim as
Blossom’s can afford the joys of Marlboro—joys far beyond
their paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and
carefully packed, and an exclusive selectrate filter. Croesus
himself could not buy a better cigarette!

However, Marlboro’s most passionate admirers—among
whose number I am paid to count myself —would not claim that
Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blossom
grew steadily moroser.

Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho-
more named Tom O’Shanter at a nearby men’s college. “Blos-
som,” said Tom, “I want you to come down next week for the
barley festival, and I won’t take no for an answer.”

“No,” said Blossom,

“Foolish girl,” said Tom gently. “I know why you refuse
me. It is because you are poor, isn’t it?”

“Yes,” said Blossom.

“T will send you a railroad ticket,” said Tom. “Also a hard-
boiled egg in case you get hungry on the train.”

“But I have nothing to wear,” said Blossom.

Tom replied, “‘I will send you one suit of cashmere, two gowns
of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, five socks of
nylon, and a partridge in a pear tree.”

“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.”’

“Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab,” said Tom.

“You are terribly decent,” said Blossom, “but I cannot
come to your party because all the other girls at the party
will be from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but
a humble woodcutter.”’

“T will buy him Yosemite,” said Tom.

“You have a great heart,” said Blossom. ‘Hold the phone
while I ask our wise and kindly old Dean of Women whether it
is proper for me to accept all these gifts.”

She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and the
Dean of Women laid her wise and kindly old hand on Blossom’s
cheek and said, “Child, let not false pride rob you of happiness.
Accept these gifts from Tom.”

“Oh. bless you, Wise and Kindly,” breathed Blossom,
dropping grateful tears into the Dean’s reticule. “I must run
and tell Tom.”

“Yes, run, child,” said the Dean, a smile wrinkling her wise
and kindly old eyes. ‘And ask him has he got an older brother,”
