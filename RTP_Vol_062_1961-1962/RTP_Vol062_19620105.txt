Hungarian Refugee Leader

Will Speak Tuesday Night

A former Prime Minister of
Hungary will speak Tuesday to
a University audience.

Fernac Nagy, current chairman-
president of the Assembly of Cap-
tive European Nations, will discuss
the “Situation in Central-Eastern
Europe” in a public talk at 8 p.m.
in the university’s duPont Auditor-
ium. His appearance is being spon-
sored by the department of journal-
ism and communications.

Nagy will also speak to members
of the class in psychological warfare
and propaganda.

A native of Bisse, Hungary, the
former government official left Hun-
gary in exile in 1947. He was prime
minister in 1946 and 1947. He became
a member of the Hungarian Parlia-
ment for the first time in 1939 rising
to the group’s presidency in 1945.
He was also the country’s minister
of reconstruction that year. In 1944,

 

he was a prisoner of the German
Gestapo.

He is founder of the Smallholder’s
Party and the International Peasant
Union.

Nagy has been a chairman of the
foreign relations section of the Hun-
garian Committee, which is the exile
political organization embracing
post-war democratic Hungarian per-
sonalities and representatives of the
1956 Revolution. The committee’s
aim is the independence of Hungary
and the restoration of freedom for
Hungarians.

He has lectured at various clubs
and colleges throughout the country,
and is the author of articles in na-
tional magazines. His book, Struggle

Behind the Iron Curtain, was pub-*

lished in 1948.

Nagy has received honorary de-
grees from Bloomfield College and
the University of California.

He currently resides with his fam-
ily in Herndon.

European Prints

Are Shown Here

Prints by three European print-
makers go on display this week in
the duPont Art Gallery.

Some 35 prints by Johnny Fried-
laender, Hass and Fiorini will be
shown until the end of January,
according to Dr. Marion Junkin,
chairman of the sponsoring depart-
ment of fine arts. The prints are on
loan from a Baltimore art firm,
Roten, Ine.

Colored etchings and lithographs
and woodcuts will be included in
the month-long exhibition, the third
one held in the duPont gallery this
year.

“This is a unified and yet a di-
versified show,” Dr. Junkin said. “I
think Friedlaender is among the
two or three most important print-
makers living today.”

The prints will be for sale in a
price range of from $15 to $95, Dr.
Junkin said.

A sculpture collection from the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts was
scheduled for display during Jan-
uary, but the objects were not ready
for shipment to Washington and
Lee in time for Tuesday’s opening
date. The sculpture will be shown
during February, Dr. Junkin noted.

January is the last month in which
19 paintings from the Cincinnati
Museum of Fine Arts will be dis-
played in the parlors of the univer-
sity’s Evans Dining Hall. A new
exhibition will be hung by Dr. Jun-
kin during the examination period
at the end of the month.

 

W&L Given $1,500 Check
By Texaco Corporation

Washington and Lee has been se-
lected as a participant in the Texaco,
Inc., aid-to-education program for
support of privately-endowed col-
leges and universities.

The receipt of a check for $1,500
was announced today by President
Fred C. Cole. The funds, yet undes-
ignated, have no restrictions from
the donor.

Other Texaco gifts for the 1961-62
academic year are unrestricted do-
nations to privately-endowed col-
leges, but part of the old company’s
total gift involves scholarship and
fellowship assistance to students at
private and tax-supported institu-
tions.

 

The new science building, which
will cost approximately $1,500,000,
will house the biology, physics, and
pre-engineering departments. The
new dorm, costing about $500,000
will have 26 double rooms and 39
singles in addition to a 15-bed in-
firmary.

Work on the science building,
which is slightly behind schedule, is
being pushed. The dorm construction
is running according to time-table.
Brady said “we hope they will be on
schedule.”

The classroom hall is being built
at the same time as an addition to
adjacent Howe Hall which will add
30 per cent capacity to Howe. A
terrace will connect the two build-
ings. Brady said that the Howe An-
nex, which at present is used for
laboratories, will probably be used
by the maintenance department.

Innovations included in the con-
struction are an observatory in the
Howe addition, a greenhouse on the
top classroom level of the new build-
ing, darkrooms, and an X-ray room
for the study of crystals. Projected
improvements are a seismograph and
an artificial stream for the study of
erosion. Housing only a few class-
rooms, the new building will include
many labs, libraries for each depart-
ment, and research rooms.

The new dorm is double the size

Barritt Attends
Language Forum

Dr. Westbrook Barritt, associate
professor of romance languages was
one of four panelists December 30
for an open forum of the National
Federation of Modern Language
Teachers Associations.

 

The special meeting was held in
the Palmer House in Chicago. The
topic for discussion was “Modern
Foreign Languages and Their Teach-
ing.”

Other panelists were Dr. W.
Wright Kirk, Dickinson College; Dr.
Solomon Lipp, Boston University;
and Dr. R. Ross Macdonald, George-
town University.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1952, Dr. Barritt’s
primary language is Spanish. He re-
ceived his Ph.D. degree from the
University of Virginia in 1952. He
received his undergraduate degree
from Washington and Lee. He also
has attended Lehigh and Harvard
Universities.

McCormick Library Adds
Modern Reading Room;
Capacity Increased to 300

Cyrus McCormick Library has
added an additional reading room
to its study facilities. The refurnish-
ed room has a seating capacity of
sixty students, increasing the total
library capacity from two-hundred-
forty students to an even three

hundred.

The room, on the second floor at
the head of the stairs, has been fur-
nished and shelved since last sum-
mer. A young alumnus, formerly an
assistant librarian, custom built the
new furniture. The painting was
completed before the University
opened its current session.

In the library remodeling of 1941,
the Alumni Association had plans
to establish a memorial browsing
room here, However, World War II
intervened, and it never served that
purpose. It has served as an art
gallery, and as a press conference
room for Harry Truman when he
was at Lexington for the Mock Con-
vention.

Now its bright new fluorescent
lights welcome sixty conscientious
students.

Debaters Enter
ACC Contest

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Washington and Lee’s debating
Team faces “the best teams in the
South” today and tomorrow in the
Atlantic Coast Conference Tourna-
ment at Duke University, Durham,
North Carolina.

Sophomores Bill Noell and Al
Eckes, state champion negative team,
have shifted to the affirmative side
for this debate. Soph Dick McEnally
and senior Robin Wood will debate
the negative side of this proposal.
The question is “Resolved, that labor
organizations should be under the
jurisdiction of antitrust legislation.”

Washington and Lee is the only
school in the group of six entrants
not a member of the Atlantic Coast
Conference. The five ACC schools
participating are South Carolina,
North Carolina, Wake Forest, Duke,
and Virginia. W&L debate coach
William Chaffin noted, “This is a
highly selective tournament in which
we will face the best teams in the
South.”

Washington and Lee captured sec-
ond place in both affirmative and
negative divisions in last year’s ACC
tournament.

Wood will also represent the
school in an “impromptu” speech
contest. Contestants will draw topics
and will have 45 minutes to pre-
pare their speeches.

Monday afternoon Chaffin will
send a team to Hampden-Sydney
for a dual meet. Two teams from
Washington and Lee will debate
both sides of the question in the
meet. Representing W&L will be
Steve Smith, Malcolm Morris, Ed
Norton, and Barry Staniar. Norton
and Staniar will experience their
first intercollegiate debating on the
trip.

Starts Competition Next Year

 

FD Costumes

Go On Sale

For Last Time

Costumes for the 1961 Fancy Dress
Ball will go on sale for the last time
next week, announced Dance Board
vice president Frank Young. The
costumes will be available in the
Student Union from 9:00 a.m. until
5:00 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday,
January 10 and 11.

The rental price for the complete
costume is $10. Students may pay
for them by cash or check when they
rent them, but do not have to pay
until the costumes are picked up in
February.

Young says that student interest
in the Fancy Dress Ball has in-
creased significantly. Last year only
280 costumes were rented; this year,
320 have already been sold and it is
estimated that many more will be
bought next week. Increased at-
tendance at the university dances
will enable the Dance Board to pro-
vide better and better entertain-
ment for them and continue with
plans to improve the dance sets in
other ways, such as holding the
dances in the Evans Dining Hall.

In keeping with the theme of the
weekend, the costumes will be full
dress for the men and formal eve-
ning gowns for the ladies. Also, for
the first time, the Commons will be
available for the dance.

The Ball will be held Friday night,
February 2, from 9 p.m. to 1 am.
The jazz Concert, featuring Dave
Brubeck, will be in the Doremus
Gymnasium between 3 and 5 p.m.
on Saturday, February 3. That night
Si Zentner and his orchestra will
provide the music for a dance be-
tween 8 p.m. and midnight.

The change in the hours of the
Saturday night dance is to facilitate
the scheduling of fraternity house
parties. The fraternities have agreed
to hold their evening combo parties
between 9:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. in
order to avoid some of the usual
conflict between university and fra-
ternity events.

Dress for the Concert and Satur-
day dance will be conventional.

NBC Will Feature Lee

Robert E. Lee’s five years as Pres-
ident of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity will be featured on NBC
television January 15 on the NBC
Projects program.

The network is presenting a por-
trait of Lee in conjunction with the
Civil War Centennial. The show, en-
titled, “Lee, the Virginian,” will in-
clude the story of Lee’s work at
Washington and Lee, “Stressing Lee’s
peace-loving attitude and confirm-

Day Publishes
Faulkner Study

An article on novelist William

Georgia Review.

Entitled “The War Stories of Wil-
liam Faulkner,’ Day’s article is a

by critics.

The Georgia Review is a quarterly
magazine published by the Univer-

The formation of a new athletic conference among Centre
College of Kentucky, Southwestern at Memphis, the University
of the South, and Washington and Lee was announced here
today by President Fred C. Cole.

President Cole said the new organization will be known as
The College Athletic Conference and will become operational

in 1962-63.

The conference will sponsor inter-*

collegiate competition in football,
basketball, golf, tennis, track and
field, and baseball. Other sports may
be added later, President Cole said.

Under the conference’s Articles of
Organization, a “cardinal principle”
of the league is “that all participa-
tion in sports by members of its
teams shall be solely because of
interest in and the enjoyment of the
game.”

“No financial aid shall be given
to any student which is conditioned
upon, or for the purpose of en-
couraging, his participation in inter-
collegiate sports,” the articles state.
“All financial aids of the member
institutions shall be administered by
a single agency of the faculty. No
aid funds shall be specifically re-
served for athletes, and the directors
of athletics and coaches shall have
no voice in participation in the de-
termination of recipients or amounts
of financial aid to any student.
Criteria for admission to the individ-
ual member institutions shall be the
same for all students.”

The conference will be governed

In The News

Dr. Gaines In The Times

From the Rockbridge County News

The name of Dr. Francis P. Gaines,
Chancellor of Washington and Lee,
appeared beside names of leaders of
nations in the New York Times
Magazine’s selection of the year’s
outstanding quotations last Sunday.

The magazine feature was entitled
“Anno Domini 1961—In Quotes.”

Under the heading “World Af-
fairs,” the quotation by Dr. Gaines
states, “War, with its tidal waves
of destruction, slaughter and grief,
is the answer to no human problem,
and it is an insult to the intelligence
that God gave us that we cannot
find other answers.”

Dr. Gaines’ quotation was taken
from a Civil War centennial address
which he gave in the National Ca-
thedral last February.

The only other persons quoted on
the subject of world affairs were
President Kennedy, Sir Anthony
Eden, Premier Khrushchev, Bertrand
Russell, President Eisenhower, Pope
John XXIII and French statesman

Jean Monnet.

Defenders Back Board

Richmond—tThe Defenders of State
Sovereignty and Individual Liber-
ties gave its approval here Saturday
to the action of the Washington and
Lee University Board of Trustees in
refusing to let a desegregation leader
speak at the school.

A student group at Washington
and Lee recently wanted to invite
the Rev. Martin Luther King to
speak at a meeting, but the action
was overruled by the School’s board
of trustees.

The Defenders voted approval to
the board for refusing “the use of its

 

school as a forum and _ prestige-
builder for one who has been very
actively associated with commun-
nists...”

DATES TO KEEP IN MIND

by a Board of Directors composed of
the presidents of the member insti-
tutions. The chairmanship will be
rotated among the directors at their
discretion. Vice Chancellor and
President Edward McCrady of the
University of the South will be the
Board’s first chairman. Other mem-
bers are President Thomas A. Sprag-
ens of Centre, President Peyton N.
Rhodes of Southwestern, and Presi-
dent Cole.

Additional members may be ad-
mitted to the conference upon unan-
imous approval of the Board of Di-
rectors.

While the four founding members
are all Southern institutions, Presi-
dent Cole said it was not the in-
tention of the Board to limit the
conference geographically. He said
other colleges and universities in the
East and Midwest could become
members.

An administrative council com-
posed of representatives of each
school will handle scheduling and
other routine annual business. The
council is authorized to conduct an
annual basketball tournament and
annual meets in the spring sports.
Other sports can be added to the
conference program at the council’s
discretion, and the council will de-
cide how champions in each sport
will be determined.

The Articles of
States:

“It shall be the general purpose
of the Conference to foster compe-
tition in as many sports as may be
successfully provided by the mem-
bers within the limits of budget cap-
abilities. A major objective shall
be the encouragement of widespread
participation in healthful sports by
members of their various student
bodies.”

The articles provide no conference
rules on eligibility as such. They
state, “It is assumed that all mem-
ber institutions will permit partici-
pation on their athletic teams only
to regular, full-time students in
good standing as defined by the
regulations of their respective facul-
ties.”

“Each member institution has full
respect for the integrity of the other
members, for the selective nature
of their admission standards, and for
their existing standards of academic
qualification,” the articles declare.

All members of the new confer-
ence have had previous conference
affiliation. Centre was a member of
the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference until 1945, and from
1946 to 1959, the college participated
in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Ath-
letic Conference in basketball only.
Southwestern also once belonged
to the Southern Intercollegiate Ath-
letic Conference, and for five years
was a member of the Dixie Confer-
ence, withdrawing in 1940.

The University of the South,
known better in athletic circles as
Sewanee, was a charter member of
the Southeastern Conference until
1939. Washington and Lee was a
charter member of the Southern
Conference and ended its affiliation
with that group in 1958.

The four teams have been propon-
ents of non-subsidized athleties for
many years. Southwestern hasn't
given an athletic scholarship since
1942, Centre and Sewanee gave up
athletic grants-in-aid in 1946, and
Washington and Lee began its non-
subsidized program in 1954.

All four schools boast rich athletic
histories, and all four have pro-
duced outstanding teams in various
sports since adopting current sports
policies.

A Cautious Step Forward

The new College Athletic Conference in which Washington
and Lee has joined with Sewanee, Centre, and Southwestern
should prove a marked improvement over our present inde-
pendent status, on the whole. There are drawbacks readily ap-
parent to anyone who has taken an interest in athletics at
Washington and Lee, but further thought should reveal that
it is the best thing that we can do at this time.

The conference will certainly be a disappointment to
people who hoped that Washington and Lee could take the
lead in a conference which would draw Virginia, Davidson, and
William and Mary into the non-subsidized ranks. That hope
has proven a long-range one because each of these other
schools has alumni and an athletic staff who oppose such a
move. More eligible candidates for the new conference, such
as Randolph-Macon, Hampden-Sydney, and Davidson also
must have been at least approached when the conference was
being formed. They, too, must have felt that they were unable
to go along at present with the program which prevails at
W&L and the other founders. We can surmise, then, that the
four schools who have founded the new conference were the
only ones within hundreds of miles who were prepared for
such a move.

Problems For New Members

And yet the formation of the conference could wait until
eight or ten schools saw the light and were converted to our
type of program. Only a flourishing conference will provide
a refuge for schools who want to go through the painful transi-
tion from subsidized athletics to our type of program. President
Cole and the others have shown a great deal of wisdom in not
setting down specific rules for membership. The conference is
based on mutual trust and respect that the members have for
each other’s integrity. This element will, however, present a
problem to new members, for it forces them to work their own
program in a manner satisfactory to the present members with-
out providing a detailed program as a guideline. Hampden-
Sydney, Randolph-Macon, Johns Hopkins, and Franklin and
Marshall of the schools we now have regular athletic relations
with, could probably join the conference rather quickly and
easily, if they were of a mind to. This would be another matter,
however, for Davidson or William and Mary, with their present
programs. It would probably take several years for them to
settle down into a program that satisfied them.

The conference will provide more spirited competition
among the four schools which make it up and should not de-
tract from our competition with the rest of our schedules.

But the conference does not seem to us to be a good final
solution of the problem of schedueling good athletic competi-
tion. We hope that the University will not become satisfied with
the level of our athletic competition. It could be quite a bit bet-
terer. If competition is the main goal, we should not be afraid to
play subsidized teams. What if they are tainted? We are mainly
interested in whether or not we can beat them. We would hate
to see W&L draw into a little “amateur” world of its own.

Level Of Competition Needs Raising

We still think that the best way for us to bring Davidson,
Virginia, and William and Mary around to our way of think-
ing is to show that we can maintain a high level of competi-
tion wthout compromising our integrity or our academic stand-
ards. We will never do it if we are satisfied with our present
competition.

Many people have looked to Washington and Lee to start
a trend toward desubsidization throughout the South. Sewanee,
Southwestern, and Centre have rich athletic histories and have
proven worthy opponents for us since we desubsidized. We
may expect spirited competition from them in the new con-
ference. But they are too small, and too far away to provide the
full range of competition that most people expect from a con-
ference. We should not gear our athletic program to their
standards. In most sports, except football and basketball, we
can maintain Southern Conference and Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence levels of competition, given good coaches, and adequate
facilities.

We think that a young man who is an athlete will choose
a college where he can participate in the best intercollegiate
competition of which he is capable. Good athletes run just as
smart as mediocre ones. It should be our aim to have them at
W&L. But if they can get just as good an education at U.Va.,
ot Davidson, or Princeton, and play ball in a better league, it’s
a pretty good bet that they won’t come here.

We think the conference will be an excellent thing until
we pull our athletic standards up. Until then, we shouldn’t let
the fun we’re having on those fancy plane trips to Tennessee
detract from our primary goal to make Washington and Lee a
respected name in intercollegiate sports.

An Interview With Dr. Colvin

 

President Kennedy’s First Year

By TRACY HARRINGTON

After a hectic and eventful year
as president, John F. Kennedy’s
popularity is at an all time high—
about 80%, which is higher than
that of ex-president Eisenhower’s at
any time during his eight year term.

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, is a Ken-
nedy man. He supported Kennedy
“before the convention, after the
convention, and still supports him.”

After he was defeated for Con-
gress in the Democratic Primary in
1960 in Montana, Dr. Colvin worked
helping to set up Citizens for Ken-
nedy groups. In the summer of 1960
he headed the state organization for
Kennedy in Montana. In August,
1960, he had to choose between
working fulltime with Ted Kennedy
in the Northwestern campaign or
teaching at the University of Chi-
cago. He chose “the academic life.”

What does this man—an obviously
qualified judge—think of Kennedy’s
first year as chief executive?

“I do not think he has done every-
thing well, but I think he has done
most things well, and that is pretty
good these days,” he said.

Discussing Kennedy’s popularity,
Dr. Colvin pointed out that “person-
al popularity is not to be confused
with popularity for presidential pro-
grams.”

New Push for Old Issues

He added, however, that Kennedy
managed to push though Congress
most of the legislation that he want-
ed, and that the new Congress will
see “attempts by the White House
to get though Congress legislation
that did not make it previously.” He
cited financial aid for the aged,
federal aid to education and lowered
tariffs as examples.

Kennedy, according to Dr. Col-
vin, has proved himself to be a
moderate in office. “President Ken-
nedy has not asked for any further
civil rights legislation and he has
not pressed for an anti-discrimina-
tion policy in the field of housing.
In short, he has been paying very
little attention to the ADA (an ex-
treme left-wing organization).”

Dr. Colvin believes that the Ken-
nedy administration has demonstrat-
ed that it is not anti-business, “for
America has just come through a
highly prosperous year.”

 

According to Dr. Colvin, what the
Kennedy administration has done in
the world of business is “to ask busi-
ness to live up to its profound be-
lief in free enterprise by (a) not
rigging prices and (b) taking its
chance in open competition with
foreign trade.”

“Free Enterprise Man”

Dr. Colvin said that “those who
scream the most about free enter-
prise are those who want to con-
tinue rigging prices and seek pro-
tection through tariffs.’ He added
that “Mr. Kennedy is more a free
enterprise man than some of his
critics.”

On the topic of unemployment,
Dr. Colvin said the problem of a high
rate of unemployment “still nags us.”
He added, though, that this is more
of a social problem than a political
one, entailing re-training unskilled
laborers made jobless by automation.

“Government, industry, and labor
are all working on this problem,” he
said. “But it will take time before
results can be seen. It isn’t going
to happen overnight.

Discussing President Kennedy’s
appointees, Dr. Colvin said the chief
executive “has made the term ‘in-
tellectual’ no longer a nasty word.
He goes out of his way to bring
scholars into government, and to
give them a chance to exercise their
knowledge in policy-making deci-
sions. This is healthy as long as it
isn’t overdone.”

The Catholic Question

A Roman Catholic himself, Dr.
Colvin commended the policy of
Kennedy on the aid to parochial
schools issue. “Many protestants
genuinely feared that a Catholic
president would take orders from
the Catholic hierarchy. The strong
stand Kennedy ha staken on the
school issue against such men as
Cardinal Spellman has made it clear
to doubting protestants that a Cath-
olic is under no obligation to agree
with the hishops of the church on
politics or education.”

Turning from Kennedy on the
domestic scene to Kennedy in for-
eign affairs, Dr. Colvin said that
there is a “genuine feeling with the
exception of the Cuban fiasco, that
Mr. Kennedy is keeping the country
on an even course in international
issues.”

 

Dr. Colvin praised Kennedy for
having won the respect of Khurh-
chev for being a “tough man.”

The Cuban Fiasco

On the Cuban issue, Dr. Colvin
disaggreed with Kennedy. He said
that we should have supplied what-
ever force necessary “to topple Cas-
tro.” But, he said, “that is water
over the dam now.”

Concerning Berlin, Kennedy has
made it clear, Dr. Colvin said, that
we are going to stay. “And this has
obviously gotten through to Khrush-
chev. Certainly he (Khrushchev)
has become less bellicose and less
anxious to force a showdown in
Berlin.”

Kennedy appreciates, according to
Dr. Colvin, that “to pull out of Ber-
lin would mean the collapse of
NATO and communist domination
of Europe.”

The administration’s policy in the
Far East reflects the attitudes of
most Americans, says the ex-Mon-
tana politician. “While Americans
are willing to take a strong stand
in Europe, they are less willing to
take it in Asia—and this is Ken-
nedy’s approach.”

Southeast Asia

He added that none of the anti-
communist countries of Southeast
Asia “are really very democratic
as we understand the word demo-
cratic.”

Dr. Colvin said that what we are
having to do in the East is “choose
between the lesser of two evils. A
good example of this is South Viet
Nam.”

On the subject of the common
market, Dr. Colvin said Kennedy has
made it clear we won’t join. “The
Common market will, however, force
us to produce better goods. We will
be in competition with the best
craftsmen and artisans of Europe,
and no longer will we be able to
turn out some of the shoddy goods
that we have in the past.”

Dr. Colvin believes that “there is
no indication” the administration
has any intention of joining the
Common Market.

In summation, Dr. Colvin said, “I
like a man who is young, vigorous,
has been shot at in war, who
is educated, and who knows where
he is going. This pretty much char-
acterizes John Kennedy.”

 

Pity Our Poor Youth! They

ve Analyzed

And Classified, Right And Not-So-Right

By HOWARD SLATER

This is an historical period in
which we live—historical, that is, in
that it is significantly eventful. And
if there will be an opportunity for
our time to be observed in retro-
spect, then it, or an event during
its duration, will probably be singled
out as “crucial” or as a “turning
point.” Both crucial, and turning
point, do not necessarily have to
mean very much, except as part of
historical or journalistic jargon, but
we generally accept them as de-
scriptive of changes in destiny.

When these changes affect the
human race—to which we sometimes
admit a sentimental kinship—then
it is no wonder that we are referred
to as a Generation of Destiny. This,
more than the fact that this is an
age of criticism, is the reason for
the many analyses and autopsies on
on Youth. The latest exclusive and
revealing insight into the nature of
the present-day youth has appeared
in the Saturday Evening Post. Life
and Look, among others, have re-
cently had a go at it, trying to come
up with a cute label for us, to
match such pearls as the Lost Gen-
eration, the Depressed Generation
(or whatever they were called in
the 30’s), and the Silent Generation.

Hollywood Analysts

Speaking not necessarily as a
spokesman for this decade of young
people, but at least as a member of
the group, I resent this category-
seeking. Analysis in itself is not a
bad thing. It can certainly help us
to understand ourselves and see if
and how we differ from our prede-
cessors at a comparable stage of de-
velopment. But those who are ana-
lysing us en masse are not fit for
the job. Probably they have been

 

too influenced by Hollywood myths
and the very same garbage which
they now issue forth for the afore-
mentioned magazines and others like
them.

That we are not, on the whole, in-
clined to be romantically dreamy in
the Hollywood or Victorian fashion
is probably the one basic difference
between ourselves and our prede-
cessors—and even that is not too
definite, for our immediate predeces-
sors had the Depression and World
War II from which to spin out their
bile. In most respects, though, hu-
mans are basically the same from
decade to decade. This is what is be-
ing overlooked in the rush to pin
a label on us.

Our elders seem to be amazed
at the knowledgeability of the
young generation. But I am con-
vinced that there is no such thing.
It is concentrated mostly among
college students. Even then, most of
us are really only opinionated, be-
cause of our contact with current
developments through newspapers,
radio and television. Youth pretty
much has its mind made up, with-
out giving reasons why. There is no
reason to believe that we are think-
ing logically and causatively. (I do
not mean to be pompous. Please
notice the “we.”)

Percentages Misused

But the interesting aspect about
this labeling is the way in which
young people are transformed into
percentages. Also, it seems, youths
are either for something, or they
don’t exist. As an example, say that
it is determined (don’t ask how) that
85 per cent of us Twist. In that case,
the other 15 per cent, presumably,
doesn’t—or if it does, is in some
Twistless limbo. Our elders do not

 

take the dissenters among us into
account. This is an _ unfortunate
oversight, since they are probabbly
the future decision-makers of our
generation.

That is why the importance of the
minority groups which have emerg-
ed recently, and whic hthe New
York Times calls “the Rampageous
Right,” cannot be minimized. Al-
though they are dissenters, and in
the minority, they are possible de-
cision-makers in their potential in-
fluence upon the more stable ele-
ments in our society.

“Romantic Cure-allers”

It is a personal observation that
these right-wing groups are in the
60’s what the left-wingers were in
in the 30’s—romantic cure-allers.
There is no easy way to solve our
problems and the world’s. For this
reason ,sometimes even the less ex-
treme conservatives have to be in-
cluded as cure-allers, when they
seek solutions by “standing pat.”
Things were better in the old days,
and if we can’t go back then let’s
not cause any more trouble by go-
ing ahead. This, of course, is a nega-
tive cure-all, and another romantic
illusion.

Last year, Newsweek reported, in
another attempt to fathom the young
generation’s orientation, that there
was a definite movement to the right
in collge ranks. This year, the Post
says that this is not true. I hope it
is not. If we are a generation of
destiny, perplexed with a situation
which mankind may not survive,
then we must stay in the middle,
veering neither to left nor right. We
must be realistic. If, as I suggested
before, or generation is not duped
by the illusion of romance, then we
will be realistic.

Behind The News

The announcement of the new
College Athletic Conference natur-
ally gives rise to speculation on
nick names to be used by the news-
papers. “The Fearsome Foursome”
has been knocked around the print
shop for several days. Someone else
has suggested “The Play-for-Fun
Four.”

Frank Parsons, who ought to
know, says that the new conference
will be called “The Ivory League.”
Why? “It’s “It’s 99 and 44/100 per

cent pure.”

W&L Resumes BKB
Action Here Saturday

By STEVE HENRY
Washington and Lee’s varsity basketballers get back into
action after an extended holiday break when they meet Lynch-
burg College in Doremus Gymnasium tomorrow night. Game

time is 8.

Head coach Bob McHenry’s Generals are looking for the

win that will even their seaso

current campaign.
Big

“They've got one of the biggest
frontlines we'll meet,” said McHenry.
“We've got to outhustle them on the
boards if we’re going to win.”

Lynchburg has the biggest indi-
vidual player that'll appear in Do-
remus this year, 6’7” Charles Miller.

Also up front will be 63” Fred
Lanford and 6’5” Arthur Poindexter.

Lynchburg’s record this year in-
cludes a win over RPI and losses to
Randolph-Macon and MHampden-
Sydney, both excellent teams.

Defense

McHenry has stressed defense in
the four-day preparation for the
Lynchburg game.

In the Generals’ last action, an
86-79 win over Franklin and Mar-
shall, a loose W&L defense almost
offset an outstanding team offen-
sive offort.

“We can’t expect to score that
many points too often,” said Mc-
Henry. “And we certainly can’t give
up that many points and expect to
win.”

Man-to-Man

McHenry said he’ll send his guards
into an aggressive man-to-man, in
which the ball-handler will be
picked up at half court.

He'll keep the forwards back as
much as possible to give the Gen-
erals better rebounding strength
against the taller Hornets.

“Lynchburg has two fast, hustling
guards,” he said. “They like to fast
break. We've got to stop them and
force mistakes.”

McHenry will go with the same
starting line-up that stopped Frankl-
lin and Marshall.

That will be Tom Supac and
Louie Paterno at guards, Bip Faub-
er and Bill Ide at forwards, and Bill
Smith in the pivot.

Fauber, Ide and Smith all played
their best games of the year against
the Diplomats.

Fauber got a game-high 31 points
and 23 rebounds; Ide got 20 points
and played an outstanding floor
game; and Smith got 13 rebounds
and several key assists.

 

Coach Mac Accepts Award

Head football coach Lee McLaugh-
lin will take a pleasant trip to
Washington on January 13 to ac-
cept the Washington Touchdown
Club’s “Outstanding Small College
Football Team” award for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Accompanying him will be the en-
tire General football coaching staff,
and athletic director E. P. Twombly.

PikKA’s Take
First Defeat
In Wrestling

By HOWIE KORMAN

Last night the grapplers from DU
knocked PiKA from the ranks of the
unbeaten by gaining their first win
in three contests. DU received fif-
teen points early in the match by
forfeits, and then coasted to a
18-14 triumph.

Frosh Bob Patton earned the vic-
tors’ other three points by defeat-
ing his counterpart 6-3 in the 157
‘Ib. class. Winning on points for
PiKA were Chester White, Bruce
Houghton, and Conway Shield. The
other five markers were achieved by
freshman Andy Kilpatrick, by for-
feit.

Division Leaders

In Division A of the wrestling
league the Delts have a firm hold
on the top position with a record
of three wins and no defeats. ZBT,
Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu are all
fighting for second place with each
having one victory in two contests.

Division B is slightly closer as
SPE holds first place with two wins
in the same number of contests.
The wrestlers from KA are not too
far behind with two wins and one
setback. The Betas and SAE have
yet to win a contest.

The representatives from Phi Gam
defeated their three opponents to
date to remain undefeated in Di-
vision C. Phi Kap, which has one of
the highest number of total points in
I-M play, has a record of two and
one, but has been beaten by the
league leaders earlier this season.

In Division D. the grapplers from
Phi Psi have a perfect record and
have the strength to finish the sea-
son undefeated. They have defeated
DU and KS, having to face only
PiKA on January 11.

Basketball
On January 4 I-M basketball re-
sumed with Sigma Nu, Sigma Chi,

and SAE emerging with victories.

Delts Hold Slim Lead In Intra-Murals

Delta Tau Delta holds a slim lead
in intramural athletic competition,
but seven other houses are within
50 points of the leaders.

In sports completed before the
Christmas holidays, the Delts built
up an impressive overall total of
405 points out of a possible 500.

Events counting on scoring so
far are football, turkey trot, swim-
ming, tennis and golf.

Trailing the Delts by only seven
points are two houses deadlocked
for second place, the Pi Kappa Sigs
and the PiKA’s, both with 398 points.

Sigma Chi, with 389 points, Sigma
Phi Epsilon, with 385 points, Phi
Delta Theta, with 367 points, Sigma
Nu, with 361 points, and Delta Up-
silon, with 355 points, round out the
leaders.

Intramural basketball, handball,
bowling and wrestling are currently
underway.

Other Teams

(Continued from page 1)

Centre’s famed “Prayin Colonels”
of 1921 laid claim to the national
collegiate football title, and in 1955,
the Colonels recorded a_ perfect
8-0-0 season. Southwestern’s 1938
Lynx defeated Mississippi State on
the way to a record 7-1-1, the best
in school history. In 1955, the Lynx
were 6-2, with one of the losses
against Centre’s fine team.

Sewanee recorded an athletic fete
unparalleled in football history in
1899 when the Tigers’ greatest team
won 12, lost none. Among the vic-
tories were five wins in six days
over Texas, Texas A&M, Tulane,
Louisiana State, and Mississippi
while the team covered 3,000 miles
on the trip. In 1958, the Tigers again
boasted a perfect season of eight
wins, no losses.

Washington and Lee had a “golden
age” of football in 1914-16, which in-
cluded a 9-0-0 season , but the
schools most recent best effort in
major college competition was in
1950 with an 8-2-0 mark and an
appearance in the ’Gator Bowl on
January 1, 1951. The Generals are
currently undefeated in 19 consecu-
tive games and were 9-0-0 in 1961.

Two of the new conference’s mem-
bers are co-educational institutions.
Centre has an enrollment of 471 stu-
dents, about half of them women.
Southwestern’s 812 students include
394 women.

Sewanee’s current enrollment is
722 students, including 72 in the
university’s theological seminary.
Washington and Lee lists 1,186 stu-
dents with 130 of these law students
who seldom participate in inter-
collegiate athletics.

Ambitious VMI Developing Fast

By BILL BOWEN

(Editor’s note—We think that this
article on VMI, which Bill Bowen
wrote as part of his regular course
work in the journalism department,
might be of interest to the Wash-
ington and Lee Community, because
of the close proximity of the two
Lexington campuses.)

In keeping with the tradition of
expansion and improvement that has
prevailed at the Virginia Military
Institute since its founding in 1939,
VMI has entered 1962 with a six-
year program designed to provide
expanded physical, recreational and
intellectual facilities for a corps
which, since World War II, has in-
creased by one-third to its present
size of 1,050.

The six-year development pro-
gram is designed to meet existing
needs of the present corps and to
provide for a modest increase in stu-
dents by 1964.

Included in the development plan
are a new administration building—
administrative facilities at present
are located in scattered areas and a
part of needed library and barracks
space is being used for offices—a
recerational center for use by the

cadets, rehabilitation and enlarge-
ment of several academic buildings,
improvement and expansion of cur-
rently-inadequate out-of-doors phy-
sical training and athletic areas, ad-
ditional faculty housing and a sus-
tained program of broadened aca-
demic essentials through library and
departmental acquisitions.

Funds for some of the proposed
improvements will be requested in
the budget which VMI will submit
to the forthcoming General Assemb-
ly.

Although improvement is certain-
ly the key word for the future plans
of the Institute, she need not be
ashamed of the past; for looking
back on a year of academic achieve-
ment VMI can boast of four top
national and academic awards cap-
tured by graduating Cadets—a
Rhodes Scholarship, two Woodrow
Wilson Fellowships and a Danforth
Fellowship.

Still other graduates have gone on
to further their education in such
fields as history, law, English and
medicine.

A highlight of 1961 was the inaug-
uration in May of Major General
George R. E. Shell as the ninth
superintendent of the Institute. Gen-
eral Shell succeeded Major General
William H. Milton, who resigned in
1960.

Among steps taken last year to
strengthen the academic program
was the institution of a “quality
standard system” which upgraded on
an average basis overall require-
ments necessary to advance from
one class to another and to graduate.

VMI also benefited by the acquisi-
tion of a sub-critical nuclear reactor,
purchased for use by the physics
department with a grant from the
Atomic Energy Commission.

Various research and writing pro-
jects were engaged in by members

of the faculty during the year. “Let-|

killed at New Market during the

collaboration between Lt. Col. John
Barrett, of the history department,
and Major Robert Turner, of the
English department.

Lt. Col. Louis R. Hundley, of the
biology department, is currently
engaged in a project, with the aid of
funds from the U.S. Public Health
Service, designed to explore the
physiological changes in bone and
muscle which come about when ex-
ercise and fat loads are reduced.

A project concerning fuses is be-
ing carried on by the physics de-
partment and other faculty members
during the year contributed articles
to various publications.

The Institute also sponsored sev-
eral special events in which the pub-
lic participated. In May, more than
800 persons assembled at the Insti-
tute for the four-day annual session
of the Virginia Academy of Science
and the Junior Academy of Science.
The fifteenth annual meeting in
October of the Virginia Highway
Conference attracted several hun-
dred more.

The Institutes already-renowned
military side was presented to the
public on two special occasions—the
presidential inaugural parade in
January in which the corps of cadets
won first place among marching
units, and the observance in Virginia
of the Civil War Centennial.

Virginia Military Institute’s his-
toric part in the Civil War was re-
called when the cadet first captain
presented Virginia’s Governor J.
Lindsay Almond with a letter ad-
vising him that the Institute stands
ready for duty today as it did a
century ago when the cadets filed

 

out of barracks and set out for ac-
tive military service under Stonewall
Jackson.

of the other new ones. Its rooms will
be somewhat smaller than those of
Davis and Baker. Each room will
have running water, but will not
be as luxurious as those of the other
new dorms.

The infirmary will be connected to
the school physician’s office in Davis
dorm by an arcade walkway. There
will be no lounge in the building.
Names for the buildings have not
as yet been decided upon, but
Treasurer E. S. Mattingly conjec-
tured that the dorm might be named
either Graham or Lee. These were
once the names of the wings of the
present freshman dorm, before they
were connected over the archway.
Now the names may be used to
designate the separate dorms.

The science building is being built
by a Lynchburg contracting firm,
while the dorm is being handled by

RING IN THE NEW

Are you still writing “1961” on your papers and letters? I'll
bet you are, you scamps! But I am not one to be harsh with
those who forget we are in a new year, for I myself have long
been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my senior year at
college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of
1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such a serious
error because, as we all know, 1874 was later repealed by
President Chester A. Arthur in a fit of pique over the Black
Tom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came
to regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous
meeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.
Arthur said, “Lou, I wish I hadn’t of repealed 1874.” Where-
upon the French emperor made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi
que nous et tyler tu.” Well sir, they had many a good laugh
about that, as you can imagine.)

But T digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our
papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find something
memorable about 1962, something unique to fix it firmly in
your mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,
1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and
by 7. Take a pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962
divided by 4 is 490-1 /2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2/7.This mathe-
matical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but
we will all be so busy then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur

bi-centenary that we will scarcely have time to be writing
papers and letters and like that.

Another clever little trick to fix the year 1962 in your mind
is to remember that 1962 spelled backwards is 2691. ‘Year’
spelled backwards is “raey.” “Marlboro” spelled backwards is
“oroblram.”’ Marlboro smoked backwards is no fun at all.
Kindly do not light the filter. What you do is put the filter end
in your lips, then light the tobacco end, then draw, and then
find out what pleasure, what joy, what rapture serene it is to
smoke the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. In 1962, as
in once and future years, you'll get a lot to like in a Marlboro
available in soft pack and flip-top box in all 50 states and
Duluth.

But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects
of 1962 and high among them, of course, is the fact that in
1962 the entire House of Representatives stands for election.
There will, no doubt, be many lively and interesting contests,
but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and interesting as the one
in my own district where the leading candidate is none other
than Chester A. Arthur!

Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to come
out of retirement and run for the House of Representatives.
John Quiney Adams was the first. Mr. Adams also holds
another distinction: he was the first son of a president ever to
serve as president. It is true that Martin Van Buren’s son,
Walter “Blinky” Van Buren, was at one time offered the nomi-
nation for the presidency, but he, alas, had already accepted
a bid to beeome Mad Ludwig of Bavaria. James K. Polk’s son,
on the other hand, became Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fill-
more’s son went into air conditioning. This later was known as
the Missouri Compromise.

In Missouri, or anywhere else, there is no compromise with
quality in Marlboro or the new unfiltered king-size Philip
Morris Commander. The Commander does something new
in cigarette making—gently vacuum cleans the tobacco for
flavor and mildness. Get aboard! You'll be welcome.
