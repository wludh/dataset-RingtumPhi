Economics and Religion Departments Sponsor Seminar

 

Boulding To Lead Seminar

Kenneth E. Boulding, Pro-
fessor of Economics at the
University of Michigan will
lead a series of seminars and
lectures under the joint spon-
sorship of the Departments of
Economics and Religion, Nov.

14-15.

Professor Boulding will give
public lectures in Lee Chapel
at 7:30 each evening, it was
announced today.

The topics selected for the lectures
are “Ethical Problems of Capitalist
Development” on Tuesday and
“Ethical Problems in Socialist De-
velopment” on Wednesday.

Professor Boulding brings an un-
common background and unusual
breadth to the Washington and Lee
campus. Author among other things
of a book of poetry, There is a
Spirit, and a book of philosophy,

 

The Image, he is primarily an econ-
omist, but consistent with the con-
ception of the “whole man,” cited
above, Boulding is an active member
of the Religious Society of Friends,
recognized in theological circles as
well as in scientific company.

Kenneth Boulding was born and
educated in England, taking his B.A.
degree and first class honors at Ox-
ford University. He came to the
United States as a Commonwealth
Fellow in the University of Chicago
in 1932. He began his teaching ca-
reer at the University of Edinburgh
two years later but returned to the
United States in 1937. He has re-
sided in America since that time and
he became a United States citizen in
1948. He taught at Colgate, Fisk, lowa
State, and McGill Universities prior
to going to Michigan in 1949, and
he served for a year in the League
of Nations Secretariat.

Boulding is an economist of the
very first rank. In 1949 he received
the John Bates Clark medal of the

 

American Economic Association,an

award made biennially to an econ-
omist under forty years of age who
has done outstanding work. His
Economic Analysis, now in_ its
third edition, is one of the stand-
ard texts in the “intermediate
theory” course in economics. Other
books he has written in economics
include A Reconstruction of Eco-
nomics (1950), The Organizational
Revolution (a book in which ethical
questions are stressed, 1953), and
The Skills of the Economist (1958),
Principles of Economic Policy (1958),
and The Economics of Peace (1945).

In the field of religion he con-| :

tributed the chapter on economics
to the eclectic Religious Perspectives
in College Teaching, and his William

Penn lecture of 1942 was published | _
under the title The Practice of the

Love of God.

In addition to the public lectures,
Boulding will speak in several class-
es in religion and economics and he
will meet with some students and
faculty members in less formal cir-
cumstances.

 

Dance Board Creates Advisory Group
Ww w

Ww

COUNCIL TO PROVIDE LINK BETWEEN STUDENTS AND BOARD

The Dance Board announc-
ed this morning that it plans
to form a committee to be
known as the Dance Board
Advisory Council.

The primary function of
this committee, Dance Board
Vice President Frank Young
said, will be to serve as a link
between the Board and the
Student Body.

Membership on the Advisory
Council, he said, will be open to
all W&L students.

Twenty to twenty-five members
will be selected, Young said.

Rely On Recommendations

The Dance Board will rely heavily
on the recommendations of this
group in formulating plans about
what bands to contact, Young ad-
ded.

 

Any student interested in serving
on this new committee should ap-
ply in writing to Frank Young at
the Phi Delta Theta House before
Wednesday, November 15. Applica-
tions should state the student’s qual-
ifications and reasons for wishing
to become a member of the commit-
tee.

Committee to Serve

The new committee will also serve
as a means of relating the actions of
the Dance Board to the students.
Members of the Council will be ac-
quainted with the activities of the
Board, Young said, thereby provid-
ing experienced members for future
years.

Meet Regularly

The committee will meet regularly
and will attempt to anticipate the
type of entertainment the Student
Body desires, he said.

In other areas, members of the
Council will assist the Dance Board
in the sale of Dance Plans and

the gymnasium.

The Council will be under the
immediate direction of Frank Young.

We Apologize
In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi
the name of Edward Paddock
Hobbs was omitted from the list
of students selected for Who's

Who in American Colleges and
Universities.

Hobbs justly deserves to be in
Who’s Who for he is tri-captain
of the football team, chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, the
ROTC battle group commander,
and is president of Scabbard and
Blade. He has also served on the
Assimilation Committee, has play-
ed baseball for four years, and is
on the Dean’s List.

The Tuesday Edition apologizes
for this error.

Resolution On Dr. King To Go To Trustees

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

In a two and one-half hour meeting yesterday afternoon the faculty approved the pro-
posed student disciplinary committee of the Executive Committee of the Student Body; ap-
proved a faculty resolution concerning Dr. Martin Luther King; and agreed to the supression

of the Mongolian Minks.

The faculty action on Martin Luther King was their first to be taken since the proposal
to invite King to the campus for a Seminar in Religion was rejected by the Board of Trustees.
The resolution, according to Frank Parsons, director of
Information Services, will be sent to each of the Trustees. At
a later date the contents of the resolution will be made public

Notice

The Constitutional Reform Com-
mittee of the Executive Committee
is making a careful study of the
Student Body Constitution. In addi-
tion it is calling for proposals for
changes in the Constitution from the
Student Body at large.

*

 

 

These proposals should be sub-
mitted in writing, accompanied by
a reason for them, to Steve Suttle)
or sent to the Executive Committee
by November 22, 1961.

It is the plan of the Reform Com- |
mittee to study these proposals and |
submit them to the Executive Com- |
mittee for voting. |

The voting will be carried out in
accordance with the present con-|
stitution.

by President Cole.

The Student Control Committee, which was approved by
the faculty, was proposed by several students during the cam-
pus elections last spring. Since the beginning of school a special
committee of the Executive Committee has been working with
the Administrative Committee of the faculty to make the stu-

dent committee effective.

The duty of the Student Council*

Committee will be to investigate
and take appropriate action on con-
duct offences reported to it by the
University Proctor, the administra-
tion of the neighboring institutions,
or the Executive Committee of the
Student Body.

The committee will (1) review all
cases of disciplinary action now
handled by the Administrative Com-
mittee, except those involving po-
lice court convictions (2) have juris-
diction in all cases concerning mis-
conduct at other schools, if the
school itself wishes to let the com-
mittee handle the matter (3) submit
all actions taken in a report to the
Dean of Students that will be
studied by the Administrative Com-
mittee, which reserves the right to
take further action on the case if
needed (4) not hold the power to
dismiss from school for disciplinary
reasons.

The Student Control Committee
itself is on a trial basis and is sub-
ject to review at any time by the
Administrative Committee and the
faculty.

Uncas McThenia, president of
the Student Body, stressed the
responsibility of the students in
a statement made late this morn-
morning. “We of the Executive
Committee very much appreciate
the trust and good faith that the
faculty has placed in the Student
Body of Washington and Lee. We
realize that we now have a great
obligation to make this proposal
work,

“A great deal of time and effort
on the part of both the Adminis-
trative Committee and the Execu-

heiieion Establishing § uP Control Committee

It is recommended that there be
appointed a Student Control Com-
mittee by the Executive Commit-
tee of the Student Body. This
committee will be composed of
two seniors, one junior, one soph-
omore, and one law student. The
chairman of the committee will be
named by the Executive Commit-
tee of the Student Body. This
committee will operate in the two
areas set forth below.

I. Inter-Institutional Relations.
If a report is received from another
institution of undesirable conduct
on the part of a Washington and
Lee student or students on that
campus, the report will be refer-
red to the Student Control Com-
ittee for investigation and appro-
priate action including disciplinary
penalties and report to the other
institution. If the Administrative
authorities of the other institution
feel that the offense is of such ser-
iousness that it prefers to have it
handled by the Administrative
authorities of Washington and Lee,
it may so request. It is understood
that the authorities of the neigh-
boring colleges will be informed
fully of any policy change that is
instituted through the action now
being proposed.

 

 

Il. Campus Conduct. The Stu- |

dent Control Committee will be
charged with responsibility for
investigating conduct offenses by

 

tive Committee has gone into the
proposal. This was done partly
because it was believed that the
students are able to assume the
authority required in this area.
The burden is now on the student
body to show that it is deserving
of this delegation of responsibili-
ty.”

Dean Frank Gilliam, Dean of
Students, had this to say of the
faculty decision:

“I think the Faculty was glad to
pass the action in its desire to
see the student authority operate
as effectively as possible in the
realm of student life and conduct;
and in the hope that the result
will be highly creditable to the
students as individuals and to
Washington and Lee as an insti-
tution.”

The third action of the faculty
in its meeting was the suppression
of the Mongolian Minks.

The Minks, a student social so-
ciety, through the action of the Ad-
ministrative Committee, will not be
permitted to appear in public or
make any public demonstration of
any kind. This action on the part of
the faculty was apparently the re-
sult of the half-time antics which
the Mongolian Minks participated in
during this year’s Homecomings
football game.

Thorns Craven, president of the
society, stated in an interview late
last night that “the action of the
faculty on the Minks comes as a
great shock to me, and I feel that
they have spelled the death of one
of the traditions of Washington and
Lee.”

 
   

SPREE

individuals reported to it by the
University Proctor or by the mem-
bers of the Executive Committee
of the Student Body. The Execu-
tive Committee of the Student
Body agrees to accept such re-
sponsibility. The Student Control
Committee will have the authority
to enforce such displinary penal-
ties (except dismissal) as it thinks
advisable. It is understood that
the Proctor will exercise his judg-
ment as to whether the offense is
of such seriousness that it should
be reported directly to the Dean
of Students for action through the
Administrative Committee rather
than to the Student Control Com-
mittee. The Student Control Com-
mittee may likewise judge a case
to be of such seriousness that it
wishes to ask that the Administ-
trative Committee take direct con-
trol. Any offense reported as a
result of police court convictions in
connection with misconduct will
automatically be referred to the
Administrative Committee
through the Dean of Students,
rather than to the Student Control
Committee.

A full report in writing of all
actions taken by the Student Con-
trol Committee will be submitted
immediately to the Dean of Stu-
dents. These reports will be sub-
mitted periodically to the Admin-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Answer:

The Tuesday Edition is not the least interested
in taking sides with the liberal versus conservative
issue, either nationally or locally. Our aim is to simp-
ly report objectively student attitudes and opinions
as reflected by the writings of campus leaders.

In none of our articles published on the King
matter has there been any concern for the political
implications involved. We are solely interested in
the fact that we have been denied the right of free
inquiry and would take the same stand whether
the personality involved was Adolph Eichman or
the Imperial Wizard of the Klu Klux Klan.

The proposal to invite King to speak here was
the decision of one group—The University Christian

Tuesday’s Stand
Not Political

Association. The proposal was then submitted by
the Faculty Committee on Christian Work to the
Board of Trustees. We mention this in answer to
the accusation that the proposal to invite Dr. King #® :
“showed a definite lack of intelligence and ability to # Dear Mr. Goodwin:

exercise mature judgment.”

In reference to the statement “your efforts to base
refusal of his invitation upon academic freedom is &
foolish and ridiculous and without the slightest
merit,” we would like to point out that this was one
of the opinions that Clarence Darrow was fighting in
1925 in the Scopes Monkey Trial.

New Committee Needs Support

The announcement today that the Washington and Lee
Faculty passed the proposal presented by the Executive Com-
mittee to form a Student Control Committee is indeed a giant
step in the area of giving the student body more control over
its own members.

 

We hail the faculty for this action, and we sincerely hope
that this committee will prove to be one of the most influential
committees on this campus.

It is necessary that each and every member of the Student
Body give his most sincere support to this committee. The
faculty has expressed a faith in the students by passing this
proposal. The Student Body should not destroy this faith by

giving only lip service to this all-important committee.

To Coach Mac And His Boys

Our gentlemen who play football won another game Sat-
urday. The Five-Star Generals massacred Centre College,
53-0, in their most lopsided win since 1951 when a subsidized
eleven trampled Virginia Tech, 60-0. The victory was the
Generals 10th in a row and marked their 16th straight game
without a loss.

But winning a game isn’t the most important thing. It’s
how you play the game that counts most in the end. Saturday
our gentlemen played their usual brand of football—‘‘Win
if you can, but first, be a gentleman.”

Applying this principle, the Generals rolled up a 37-0
halftime lead much to the embarrassment of coach Lee
McLaughlin. Coach Mac, who well remembers the long
afternoon he sat through while other teams dashed our
goal line at will in his first years at W&L, knows how the
losing coach feels. Consequently, he usually plans to hold
down the score after the Generals are comfortably ahead.

Saturday every trick he tried in an effort to stop the Gen-
erals’ steaming offensive machine backfired in his favor.

For example, on the second half kickoff he put eight mem-
bers of the White Team plus Steve Suttle, Dan Blain, and
Doug Martin on the field. Suttle, Blain, and Martin had orders
to receive the kickoff and immediately kick the ball back to
Centre. Suttle grabbed the kickoff and sent the ball soaring
over the heads of the bewildered Centre players. Centre was
so bewildered, in fact, that it fumbled Suttle’s kick and W&L
recovered. Horrors, thought McLaughlin. The troubled
coach then instructed kicking specialist Jim Russ to try a field
goal on first down. Russ’ attempt was wide. Now, thank good-
ness, Centre got the ball.

Centre, however, just did not want to co-operate with Mc-
Laughlin’s sympathetic intentions. The Colonels gave the ball
right back to the Generals and Coach Mac again ordered Russ
to exercise his toe on first down. Result, a 25-yard field goal,
Russ’ first of the season.

A short time later W&L intercepted a Centre pass
and raced deep in Colonel territory. Coach Mac again
summoned Russ, but before he could put Russ into the
game sophomore quarterback A. J. Barranco scooted six
yards for a touchdown.

Final result, a lopsided win and a bewildered coach who
wonders if it’s at all possible to keep his team from running up
astronomical scores.

Coach Mac and his boys are establishing a football tradi-
tion at Washington and Lee. A tradition of which every stu-
dent, faculty member, and alumnus should be proud. Our
gentlemen are proving to the entire country that it isn’t neces-
sary to have 30 scholarships and a ‘‘goon”’ squad to win football
games, just desire and determination.

There is one part of Coach McLaughlin’s football
philosophy that deserves special praise. Coach Mac always
tells his boys, “If you are on my team, you'll get to play,”
and he strictly adheres to this policy.

The Centre game was a fine example of just how those last
20 players of a 50 man squad, who would ride the bench on
any other team, can repay a coach for giving them an oppor-
tunity to play. W&L rolled up 323 total yards and more than
half of that total—188 yards—was gained by the third and
fourth teams. What better form of praise could be paid to a
football coach and his system than the performance of the
third and fourth teams Saturday.

Students’ Lives Hard
At W&L Century Ago

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The gradual decay of W&L’s traditions is a much discussed
topic among modern-day critics. We hear repeatedly how the
incoming freshmen are blatantly neglecting to maintain the

sacred customs so much a part of the University.
*

Our speaking tradition, observe
the critics, has practically disap-
peared, evidenced only by dim
echoes here and there from a few
die-hards. Conventional dress,
though it seems to exist still, has
likewise lost the backing of popu-
lar consent and sympathies are
turning against it. So, the school’s
moralists point out, from the few
remaining regulations of student
life we are able to detect signs of
indifference and decay.

For the benefit of those recalci-
trants who consider the yoke of tra-
dition too hard to bear, in order to
make them writhe in their complac-
ency, this edition of the Ring-tum
Phi looks to the past. Back to the
past. Back to the “good old days”
when going to college meant healthy,
rigorous discipline. Back to the days
when VMI was a nursery school
compared to the grind of W&L.

The year is 1830, a slight jump
backwards over the span of time,
we notice, for it is at night that we
make our descent upon the campus,
that the glow of candlelight scintil~
lates from each window of the stu-
dent dormitory. We can distinguish
the shadows of students in diligent
concentration over their books. Such
a sight is not to be marvelled at, for
these students are working mainly
because they have to. To encourage
them in their labor, a periodic check
is made in the dorms by a member
of the faculty.

These students had a number of
other restrictions: They had to rise
at 5 o’clock every morning and im-
mediately assemble for prayers, af-
ter which the day’s activities would
begin. In addition to the daily early
morning services, church attendance
on Sundays was compulsory.

Furthermore, no one could visit
the library without special per-
mission. (This rule was necessary
because parties of students used to
lock themselves in and organize
card games.) There were no form-
al Saturday morning classes, but
students were compelled to work
on their studies instead. The fac-
ulty had the power to dismiss any-
one who showed an attitude of in-
subordination or negligence.

Seven years later, the first conven-
tional dress was instituted. Accord-
ing to the HISTORICAL PAPERS of
W&L, the attire was made us as
follows: “A coat made of deep blue
cloth, the price of which shall not
exceed seven dollars per yard, and
that the coat be cut with a straight
collar, to be fastened before with
hooks and eyes, and be trimmed
with black braid and buttons, with
a black silk star worked on each

was for the better. However, there
have been changes made at the Uni-
versity which are not apparent to
the eye of the casual or untrained
observer.

These changes became apparent
from a reading of the views expres-
sed in your October 24th edition of
the Ring-tum Phi; particularly those
of Robert C. Ketcham, Thorns Cra-
ven and your editorial writer G.A.N.
(I presume Andy Nea) concerning
the action of the Board of Trustees
in refusing to allow Martin Luther
King to speak at the University.
Not being familiar with those who
originally extended the invitation to
King I can only surmise as to the
reasons for the invitation, mainly:
(1) Christian enlightenment, (2) na-
tional attention or notoriety for the
University, or (3) misguided liberal-
ism.

I would like to believe that the
first reason was the basis for the in-
vitation but based upon the com-
ments of your three writers men-
tioned above I cannot accept this as
the true reason. While King is no
doubt a minister of some religious
faith I feel his main claim to fame
rests upon his ability at fomenting
racial discord and unrest, which,
while it may have been intended as
non-violent, has certenly led to vio-
lence which violence was the proxi-
mate result of his urging. If Chris-
tian enlightment be the reason, cer-
tainly an outstanding minister of the

material for this column Saturday

night, we chanced upon a recent copy of The Cavalier Daily. After a
thorough perusal of this all-encompassing publication, we have come to
the conclusion that there is rampant discontent on the campus to the North.

 

=x
~

It appears that the University’s
calendar called for only a one-day
Thanksgiving holiday while the stu-
dent body had in mind a four-day
vacation. A student Council letter to
President Shannon changed nothing,
and this group announced that it
would take no further action on the
matter.

Here we quote: “Galen Danis,
the leader of the first-year group
which led the campaign for the
long holiday, had disbanded his
group.

Danis told a Cavalier Daily re-
porter, ‘We tried hard to do what we
thought was right and we tried to
do it by going through the proper
channels in a gentleman-like fash-
ion. But it seems that the student
body just didn’t care enough.
(Apathy) My group and I have
nothing to do with the rumored rally
Thursday night in Mad Bowl.’”

One column away from this ar-
ticle was the headline “Bugle, Dix-
ie Yells Occur in Riot at Dormitori-
es.” This, however, was not the riot
to which Mr. Danis was referring.
Rather this was the first in a series
of three. Mr. Danis’ Thursday night
shindig—our information is rather
scanty on this one—was the second.

 

The grand climax came last Sat-

urday night, the Saturday night of
Virginia’s Openings. As these very
reporters wearily searched the wet
streets of Charlottesville for a
story, the third riot blossomed be-
fore our eyes. There on Rugby

christian faith such as Norman Vin-
cent Peale or Cardinal Spellman
could be prevailed upon to make an
appearance during religious empha-
sis week.

As for supposed reason No. (2)—
Notoriety or national attention for
the University—Heaven forbid a
speaker of this type for this purpose.
Would you seek the attention and
notoriety visited upon Jackson,
Mississippi, Leavittown, Pennsylvan-
ia, and Little Rock, Arkansas? I be-
lieve that had this invitation been
extended, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity would have received equal
notoriety with these communities
but without the customary violence.

As for supposed reason No. (3)—
Misguided liberalism on the part of
those who would extend the invita-
tion—I can only conclude that this
is a part of the reason or answer, the
other being contained in reason No.
(2) above.

To me there is no doubt that the
motivating purpose of those who
proposed the invitation was not
Christian enlightenment, betterment
of the University or improvement
of the minds of those who would
hear the remarks King might have
made.

Mr. Craven said in his article the
decision “was for me a personal in-
sult to my intelligence and the abil-
ity of the student body to exercise
mature judgment when faced with
a current problem.” It is apparent
the proposal to extend the invitation
showed a definite lack of intelligence
and ability to exercise mature judg-

If you desire to take up the cud-
gels for the Negro, go to it, but I de-
ney your right to use the school pap-
er or the University itself to try to
ram your ideas down the throats of
impressionable young men. Your ef-
forts to base refusal of his invita-
tion upon academic freedom is fool-
ish and ridiculous and without the
slightest merit.

The Board of Trustees was entire-
ly right in its conclusion and should
be commended for not bowing to
a group which apparently thinks
more of Martin Luther King than
the University.

Editor-in-Chief

There is no such thing as justice—in or out of court.
Clarence Darrow, 1936.

After reading the column by Rosewell Page—Age-
Old Gripes: Police, Medical Office—that appeared in
last Friday’s paper, a series of events that took place
in Lexington Saturday night are of particular signif-
icance.

Years ago, as Mr. Page shows, students were
plagued by the Lexington Police, and from observing
this crew of men in uniform in action this past Sat-
urday night, I can assure you that this problem is still
very much with us.

After searching for a spot that I could use as a
good observing point, I finally found the ideal loca-
tion. It was located above one of the local pubs on
Main Street, and this observatory happened to be
the front porch of one of my associates’ apartment.

* * *

Item one: Two “townies” emerge from pub. Argu-
ment takes place, violent language, cursing and fist
fight errupts. Fight and commotion easily classified
as a “public disturbance.” Fight lasts about five to 10
minutes, no local lawman in sight.

Item two: A few minutes later, another fight breaks
out—this time on the other side of the street. Again
what I would term a “public disturbance.” Partici-
pants sight squad car approaching, break up fight, be-
gin to move down the street as if nothing had taken
place. Squad car stops, two policemen emerge. Police
talk to a few of the participants involved, tell local
hotrodders to move on. No arrest made.

dents seen walking down same street near local hang-
out. Unfortunately, one of the students has a cup in
his hand. Two VMI cadets appear. Verbal argument
takes place over who should have won Saturday’s
game between VMI and The Citadel. Loud talking,
no violence involved.

Local citizen appears, attempts to get participants
to move on. Local citizen disappears. Cadets walk
back toward VMI, students turn and begin to walk
back uptown. Student carrying cup in hand sighted
by officers in approaching squad car. Squad car stops,
police get out, take student holding cup into custody.
Police haul student off to jail.

* * *

This series of incidents, however slight it may seem,
brings a question to my mind. Is it a worse crime in
Lexington to become involved in fist fights, while
yelling and screaming gross and uncouth language, or
is it more of a crime to walk along the street with a
cup in one’s hand? The latter would appear to be the
worse offense, if what I saw happen Saturday night is
any prerequisite to forming an opinion.

It appears to me that the crux of this small incident
is basically this: If the Lexington Police worried half
as much about their local “citizens” as they did about
the conduct of the Washington and Lee students,
then Lexington might, and I say “might,” be a decent
place in which to live. Sometimes I have my doubts,

however.
* + *

The next step? Simply this. As for me, I’d better
steer clear of the Police. They’ll be after me, but I'll
be looking for them.

Generals Blank Centre, 53-0;
Capture Tenth Straight Victory

By DON WALLIS
Assistant Sports Editor

Centre College football teams have carried an unusual
nickname for many years, ever since one of them played an
unbeaten, top-ranked Army eleven to a scoreless tie in one
of the greatest upsets in football history. Sportswriters, figur-
ing the obscure little Kentucky college just couldn’t have ac-
complished this feat on its gridiron ability alone, concluded
the Colonels must have had divine inspiration and dubbed

them the “‘Prayin’ Colonels.”

The name has stayed with Centre teams, even though they
have long since stopped playing Army. In fact, considering
their performance against W&L Saturday, the Colonels must
have long since stopped praying, too.

 

At any rate, Centre didn’t have*

even a prayer of stopping the un-
defeated General steamroller as it
smashed its way to victory number
six of the season, an effortless 53-0
rout of a hapless, helpless group of
inexperienced Prayin’ Colonels.

The game was over in three
minutes, and everyone, including
Centre, knew it. At this point,
Coach Lee MacLaughlin felt con-
fident enough to yank his first

string players and rest them the
remainder of the afternoon. Four
minutes later the score was 22-0
and after that it was just a matter
of how many points the Generals
wanted to pile up.

They decided to complete the job
in gentlemanly fashion, as if in def-
erence to Sports Illustrated maga-

 

zine. After taking the count to 37-0

at the half, the Generals spent the
rest of the game running experimen-
tal patterns, crossing the goal line
only when necessary. They did,
however, remain all business on de-
fense—Centre ended 60 minutes of
football with a net rushing yardage
of one.

On offense, though, the Big Blue
took advantage of the lopsided score
to try a few unorthodox maneuvers.
At the start of the second half, for
example, Steve Suttle caught the
Centre kickoff and promptly kicked
it right back to the Colonels. Coach
Mac had called the play perfectly
legal, but seldom done during the
halftime intermission, and it worked
perfectly—the Centre players, com-
pletely surprised, failed to block at
all and the Colonel who picked the
ball up was quickly swarmed upon
by a host of W&L tacklers. He fum-
bled, the Generals recovered, and
moments later Jim Russ _ booted
Washington and Lee’s first field goai
uf the year.

John Norman ran for a touch-
down moments later. He was the
second Louisville, Ky., native to

 

IN LOSING CAUSE—Freshman Steve Hibbard, General right wing, fights Roanoke College goalie for ball in

Green Tough

Like the catcher in baseball and
the middle lineman in football, the
soccer goalie is the workhorse of the
team who seldom receives the praise
he deserves.

Soccer coach Joe Lyles, however,
has singled out Tom Green, a
Sigma Nu sophomore from St.
Louis as worthy of being Sports
Star of the Week.

“Green,” pointed out Lyles,
“played his best game of the sea-
son Friday in our 2-1 loss to Roa-
noke. Some of the saves he made
were unbelievable, and were it not
for his tremendous play in the goal

been greater than one point.”

Lean Year
“As far as the whole season is
concerned,” said Lyles, “it is just

going to be one of those lean years.
We had flunkouts and injuries which
have hurt us in key positions. Also

the margin of defeat would have, it takes the freshmen a while to

learn the ropes.”

Meet Virginia
The booters’ next game will be
away against UVa. and Lyles terms
it “a real tough game with perhaps
the best team in the state.”

score for the Generals, much to
the delight of the many W&L
alumni from Louisville who drove
to Danville for the game. The oth-
er was halfback Stu Yoffe, like
Norman a sophomore, who sprint-
ed 45 yards with an intercepted
pass in the first period and went
two yards for a conversion in the
second. Yoffe, in fact, was the
leader of the offensive attack Sat-
urday, along with fullback Doug
Martin (another Kentuckian),

Martin scored twice on runs of
eight and 24 yards. Jim Russ ac-
counted for five points on two con-
versions and his 25-yard field goal.
fommy Keessee smashed 35 yaras
for a touchdown, Robin Wood
sneaked one yard for a 6-pointer and
A. J. Barranco scored on a six-yard
carry late in the game. Charlie
Gummey ran for the conversion on
the first two touchdowns.

Sewanee Next

The easy win set the stage for
next week’s all-important game at
Sewanee, a place General teams
have found quite unfriendly in the
past. Washington and Lee will be
seeking its seventh straight win of
the year, and will also be attempting
to break the W&L record unbeaten
string of 16 games, a mark which
they tied Saturday.

Although Coach MacLaughlin
rested his charges considerably
during the afternoon, two players,
Phil McCaleb and Lanny Butler,
suffered injuries which are be-
lieved to be only minor. Both are
expected to be ready for Satur-
day’s battle at Sewanee.

IGENERAL COMMENT]

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

" A recent edition of the R-t P devoted about three inches of comment
to the S and U grades given the Freshmen this year, and the fact that
almost 100 fewer “U’s” were given out this time.

The total reads 219 this year. Thirty-eight of them were given
to the 57 freshman athletes on the football, soccer, and cross-coun-
try teams.

Maybe it’s a bit premature of us to start crying “wolf,” but this seems
to be as good a time as any to start worrying about losing those athletes
who come to W&L.

Ask Joe Lyles how much this year’s soccer team could have used
Breck Alexander, who didn’t make it past the first semester last
year. Or talk to Bob McHenry, who could certainly use John Mc-
Dowell’s 6’ 6” on this year’s basketball team, which averages 6’ 2”.

So what’s to be done? One solution might be to have the Varsity Club
tutor those athletes in the freshman class who are having trouble with
their grades.

Some of the members of the Club don’t think much of this idea. They
say they have labs, and have to practice, and still must keep their grades
up. Or, they say, it should be the job of each fraternity to make its pledges
work on their studies. Another member says it’s not so much a question
of improving the freshman’s ability to hit the books as it is to get him to
use the ability he obviously had to have to be admitted here in the first
place.

Let’s assume for a moment that this last premise is correct, and
that the freshman athletes must be made to study. How can you show
them where they can fine the time? Is this the Varsity Club’s Job?

A quick glance at the membership list of the Club shows seven men on
the Dean’s List. Two of these are busy with football in the fall and other
sports during the spring seasons. How do they do it? Where do they find
the time?

Offhand, we can think of two athletes we know who have won
their letters and have also been recommended by the University as
candidates for Rhodes Scholarships. This recommendation, needless
to say, takes pretty good grades. How do they get them?

Maybe the Varsity Club could arrange to get some of its scholastically
exemplary members together with those freshmen who are having troubles
finding time to study, practice, and do other things. Tutoring the freshmen
might best be left to the houses. But it seems to us that only an athlete can
tell another athlete where he finds the time to practice and study too. In
this respect, the Varsity Club could perform a valuable service not only
for the University’s teams, but for the freshman athletes.

GRID FILMS GOOD IDEA

The showing of the movies of our last three away games
on the Tuesday night following the game is certainly a good
idea. We urge all interested students to see these films, which
should be both informative and entertaining. Thanks to Coach
McLaughlin, who will give a comentary on the films, for his
extra efforts in making possible these Tuesday night sessions.

Evil At Work On UVa. Campus

(Continued from page 2)
Road history was being written.

Amid automobile burning and bot-
tle throwing, the students of Vir-
ginia expressed their displeasure in
a gentleman-like fashion.

We were fortunate indeed in be-
ing struck by nothing heavier than
a wadded copy of The Cavalier
Daily. This proved to be a double
blessing, for, without this missile
which we promptly salvaged, we
would have had no explanation for
the evening’s activities.

It is our opinion that Mr. Danis’
group never actually disbanded, that
it instead went underground to
work in deepest secrecy, only com-
ing out occasionally to stir up feeling
amongst an already aroused popu-
lace. Our warning to the Adminis-
tration at Virginia: There is a dark
and evil force at work on your
campus. Squelch it.
