Discuss Elections
At AP Meeting

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

Gubernatorial candidate Albertis Harrison, Jr., and his
Republican opponent H. Clyde Pearson, appeared in Lexing-
ton yesterday before the meeting of the Virginia Association
of Press Broadcasters. Both the Democratic and Republican
candidates for governor pledged to keep the citizens of the state
better informed of governmental activities if elected.

At a luncheon appearance, Albertis*

Harrison told the broadcasters that
he would like to have at least two
regularly scheduled news confer-
ences in Richmond each week. In
addition, he would make _ himself
available to the newspaper, radio
and TV representatives while travel-
ing through the state.

Harrison condemned classifying
of information by governmental
agencies which try to avoid pub-
lic embarrassment. He stated that
he believed that much of the now
classified information has little or
no direct relation to national se-
curity.

Harrison called upon the radio
and TV broadcasters to exploit their
powers for influencing public opinion
through editorializing as well as the
presentation of factual news.

The former attorney general stat-
ed that he felt that the handling of
the state’s segregational problems
by the press was excellent. This
was largely due to the co-operation
of a well informed and free press.

Jefferson Man

The Democratic candidate for gov-
ernor told broadcasters that he was
in full accord with the dictum of
Thomas Jefferson that if the choice
were either government or free
press, he would choose the latter.

He added that he felt sure if
Jefferson were saying this today,
he would include the free broad-
casting industry.

The Democratic nominee’s talk to
a luncheon meeting followed the
opening session of the VAPB at
Washington and Lee.

The Republican candidate for gov-
ernor addressed the same group of
broadcasters at an evening dinner
meeting.

Attacks Government

In his speech, Pearson criticized
what he termed as Virginia’s “shad-
ow government.” He accused it of
withholding information from the
public.

He accused the Democratic ad-
ministration of defranchising large
segments of the people, usurping

 

Harrison

 

 

 

local rights, causing industrial
stagnation, and closing public
schools.

The main charge that Pearson
leveled at the Democrats was direct-
ed toward the General Assembly. He
struck out sharply at their use of
executive sessions whereby the pub-
lic had no immediate knowledge of
their actions.

“What disturbs me and other Re-
publican members of the General
Assembly is the long-standing tra-
dition of holding executive meetings
of a committee whenever a vote is
about to be taken.” He cited in par-
ticular the committee on Privileges
and Elections.

“It is a sad commentary on Vir-
ginia’s political system that the votes
of this committee, which handles
all matters concerning voting laws,
and contested elections are never
made public.”

Pearson promised if elected to
hold at least one regularly sche-
duled press conference a week
and more if necessary to the pub-
lic interest. He also proposed a
public forum where individual
citizens would be able to question
the governor on matters of policy.

“It is easier for one Governor to
go to the people than for the people
to go to one governor,” he said.

The speeches were a part of a
two-day meeting on the W&L cam-
pus at the VAPB meeting. The
broadcasters were welcomed to the
W&L campus by Dr. O. W. Riegel,
director of the Journalism depart-
ment.

The newsmen participated in var-
ious discusssions and attended var-
ious meetings on the better useage
of the communications media.

Eighty radio and television sta-
tions throughout the state are rep-
resented at the combined fall session
and seminar for radio and television
newsmen. VAPB and Washington
and Lee University are the cospon-
sors of the meeting.

The Conference will close today
with an address by Frederick W.
Ford of the Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, D.C.

In caucuses held late last night, the University and Inde-
pendent Parties chose their candidates for the post of Executive
Committeeman representing the freshman class.
At a “clique” meeting held at the Beta House, the Univer-

will fill the twelfth seat on the
Executive Committee, the body
which acts as a general overseer of
student activities and also as a judi-

Beanie Rules

The Assimilation Committee an-
nounced today that freshmen must
continue wearing their beanies be-
yond the Homecomings weekend.

This decision was made in view
of the large number of violations
regarding the rule, a spokesman said.

The committee said that it was
“unfortunate that the entire class
must be penalized for the poor at-
titude of a few members, but the
substantial volume of violations is
indicative of a noticeably lax at-
titude in the Freshman Class.”

He expressed hope that in the
future there will be better observ-
ance of the freshman traditions of
wearing beanies and speaking first.

 

Committee Approves
Requests For Extra

Christmas Parties

The IFC reported last night that
the Faculty Committee has approved
the request for more house parties
during the two weekends before

    

 

Christmas.

The committee approved a request |
allowing eight fraternities to hold!
house parties the weekend of Dec- |
2, and granted the same privileges |
to an additional eight for the fol-|
lowing weekend.

The remaining two fraternities |
voted to hold no December parties. |

This ruling was granted as a re-
sult of the shortage of available
weekends for Christmas parties.
After the Christmas parties, the
present rule of no more than five
house parties on any “off” weekend |
will be continued.

William C. Pusey, Dean of the}
College, gave a brief talk at the
meeting explaining the Automatic |
Rule and absence regulations. He
urged that all freshmen familiarize
themselves with the rules and re-|
spect them.

In other business, Steve Rutledge,
Phi Gam President, was appointed
head of a new committee establish-
ed to study possible improvements
in Help Week.

It was also announced that the
alumni will offer four prizes this
year for Homecoming decorations.
All decorations must be completed
by 4 p.m. Friday and within a $50
expense limit.

EMPHASIS

The Academic Improvement Of Washington and Lee

EDITOR’S NOTE: Today marks the first appearance of what we
feel is an innovation and a new idea in news reporting for this news-
paper. Emphasis, which will appear weekly, will deal with subjects of
importance to this student body. Today’s subject is “The Academic
Improvement of Washington and Lee, 1957-1962.”

By BILL BOWEN
Associate Editor

Since for obvious reasons it would be impossible here to trace the
academic rise of this University since it was founded in 1749, we shall
concern ourselves with the last half of the decade, 1957 to 1962.

Before I progress any further let me state that W&L has, is, and will
continue to improve its academic standards and facilities. However, this
improvement is not soley an intrinsic one, but rather one that travels in
direct proportion to the caliber of student who applies here for admission.

Caliber of Student Has Improved

Every year since 1957 the caliber of the student entering W&L as a
freshman has steadily improved. That is to say, that the average student
entering the University this fall came better equipped academically than
his predecessor of five years ago.

Proof of this can readily be seen in steps that the English department
has taken. Five years ago this department taught a remedial English
course to boys who they felt were not quite ready for English 1. This course
dealt heavily in grammar, spelling, and in general, things that should have
been mastered in high school. Today it is no longer necessary to teach
this course.

.

   
 

 

Courses for Advanced Freshmen

In the past years the English department also had a second semester
course for advanced freshmen that allowed them to skip English 2 and
progress to the sophomore level.

Today they have been able to step this up so that exceptional students
can start this advanced course the first semester and completely skip
English 1 and 2. Further testimony to this overall improvement can be seen
in the fact that they have had to create an additional section of this ad-
vanced course to handle all of the students who qualify for it.

The math department has done very nearly the same thing in its field.

previously taught to freshmen, to a program of calculus. Here again they
have only been able to do this because of the rise in ability of the incoming
student.

On the other hand the Commerce school adopted a complete revision |
of curriculum in 1956-57 which, although it does not directly attest to the |
fact that its students are improving in caliber, certainly shows a major |
step forward in liberalizing of the department.

 

What the “C” school did was to increase the elective hours a commerce
major had from 12 to a possible 49.

Of course in terms of student improvement, this change could suggest |
that the Commerce School feels that its students today are better equipped |
to pick their courses for themselves. |

New Buildings Mark Improvement
The construction of the new science building marks another step for-
ward in the improvement of the University. This building will provide |
all four science departments with modern instructional laboratories and

football, was co-captain of the var-
sity wrestling team, lettered in var-
sity track, was a member of the de-
bate team, was elected to the Liter-
ary Society, and joined both the
math and glee clubs. He was also an
editor of the school newspaper. At
the time of his departure, Ken was
first in his class scholastically.

In the last half of the eleventh
grade, Boiarsky attented Atherton
High School where he edited the lit-
erary magazine and ran _ varsity
track.

Transferring to Wagner High
School in his twelfth year, Ken was
elected editor-in-chief of the lit-
erary magazine and again ran var-
sity track.

Continuing his interest in extra-
curricular activities at W&L, Boiar-
sky is a reporter for the Ring-tum
Phi. He also plans to wrestle and
run track when the season starts.

Boiarsky’s Statement

Upon notification of his selection
as candidate, Boiarsky stated: “I
am very grateful for the opportuni-
ty presented me, and should I be-
come Freshman Executive Commit-
teeman, I will, to the best of my
ability, carry out the responsibilities
and duties of this office.”

Party Chairman Grantham Couch
stated that “with the selection of
Ken Boiarsky, the University Party
continues its policy of selecting can-
didates of proven experience and
ability.”

Baker Is Independent’s Choice

Bob Baker, the Independent Par-
ty candidate for the office, attended
Madison High School, Madison, N. .J,
where he was active in student
government, athletics, and publica-
tions.

Bob was president of the stu-
dent body his senior year and was a
member of the student council his
freshman, sophomore, and_ senior
years.

Student Government Activities

When he was a junior he served
as a member of his class council,
and in addition was president and
secretary of the Suburban Confer-
ence of Student Councils, made up
of six high schools in the Madison
area,

In athletics, Baker lettered in
football which he played for three
years, lettered in track which he
ran for four years, and was a mem-
ber of the school gymnastics team.

In addition to these activities
Bob was an Honor Roll student for
three years ,a member of the edi-
torial board of the yearbook, and
was an active participant in the
Foreign Exchange Student program
conducted by the American Field
Service.

At W&L Baker’s activities already
include the business staff of the
Ring-tum Phi, a staff member of

| the Calyx, and a participant in the

UCA boys’ club work.
Baker’s Statement

When told he was a candidate for
the EC, Baker said, “I am very
honored by the Independent Party’s
confidence in me; and if elected by
the freshman class, I will make every
effort to honor the trust they have
shown me.”

Spud Slater, party chairman, com-
mented that “the selection of the
party tonight reflects once more
the wise and sound judgment of
the party in their selection of can-
didates.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By TOM LYBASS
Associate Editor

(Editor’s Note: This article is
the first in a series about Wash-
ington and Lee’s role in the Civil
War).

Bitter political excitement in-
volving the sectional wrangling
over slavery and the constitution-
tional rights of the South was
raging throughout the United
States in the 1850’s. Among the
many people who felt the impact
of these events were the students
of Washington College.

Until 1860 Washington College
continued to follow in its academic

and social routine quietly. Like
the W&L man of today, the stu-
dent of Washington College of the
1850’s studied hard most of the
time with only ocacsional breaks
to enjoy the social life of a fra-
ternity and to take part in extra-
curricular activities.

The curriculum of Washington
College was rigid. Similar to that
of the other institutions of the
time, it consisted of ancient and
modern languages, mathematics,
philosophy, chemistry, elocution,
and composition.

Cold Check Committee’s Action

Is Encouraging And Is Hailed:
—Keep It Up—

It is encouraging to see the Executive Committee taking
positive action with the heretofore almost non-existent Cold

Check Committee.

Cold Check Chairman Ned Hobbs is to be commended on

his proposals and on his work. His announcement that the com-

mittee will meet bi-weekly this year in an attempt to

“improve

our relationship with the merchants of Lexington by cutting

down on the number of ‘bad checks”

in Our opinion is a state-

ment that the previous Cold Check Committees have avoided

far too long.

This committee became almost

“non-existent” last year

and during years gone by. The Merchants’ Association of
Lexington, having lost faith in W&L’s organization, last year
was forced to pass a rule stating that a one dollar fine would
be impounded on all bad checks. Isn’t it a discouraging
factor to see that Washington and Lee government was not
able to handle its own problems? Isn’t it even more discour-
aging to realize that the local merchants had to ban together
to force action out of this committee?

The Executive Committee at last has recognized this prob-
lem. Their strengthening of the Cold Check Committee’s fines,
and Hobbs’ statement that he will enforce the rule which states
that all second-time offenders will be reported to the E.C., we
feel are both indicative of the ‘‘new look” in Washington and

Lee’s student government.

The Cold Check Committee has been a “‘nothing’’ organi-

zation for too long.

It is encouraging to see that this will no longer be the case
and that a definite program has been initiated and put into op-
eration. It is our sincere hope that this program will continue
to flourish and that the Committee members will do the job that
is necessary during this critical year of student government at

Washington and Lee.

Undefeatable Again?

Washington and Lee’s 40-0 victory over Franklin and Mar-
shall in Saturday’s game is indeed a living tribute to a great

team and to a great man.

A team which is composed of players who receive no
compensation of any kind, the W&L squad deserves a great
deal of praise and much cheering.

Going undefeated last season, the Generals showed the
sports world that to win you don’t have to be subsidized; you
only have to have a sincere determination to win.

We feel that last year’s undefeated season not only repre-
sented a true determination for victory, but that this record
also spoke for the efforts of one man—Coach Lee McLaughlin.

“Coach Mac”’

deserves our praise, and he deserves the

praise of the student body. He built one team—an unbeatable

team.

We can forsee that another fine record is ahead, and that
another undefeatable team is in the making.

All-Out War Would End Cycle

By DAVE KNIGHT

Tuesday Columnist
In the beginning, man pitted his
strength against the forces of na-
ture in the struggle for survival.
In the end, if man survives the ef-
fects of an all-out nuclear war, he
shall once again match wits with
these external powers. Thus the
cycle of civilization is complete.

A cursory reading of the afore-
said concept would tend to leave
the reader in a state of skepticism.

ternities, which are no longer ex-
istent, offered the students such
simple social entertainments as
corn husking contests, log-rolling
contests, shooting matches, and
hunting with hounds.

The extra-curricular activities of
Washington College men were
centered mostly on two flourish-
ing literary societies, the Wash-

*

Graham Literary Society. The pro-
gram of each meeting of these
literary societies consisted of dis-
cussion of some subject of inter-
est to the members. Some of the
subjects debated at this time were:

“Is seduction a greater moral
crime than murder?”;

“Is slavery in accordance with
the dictates of humanity?”;

“Ought the Nebraska Bill to
pass?”

There were never more than
seventy students enrolled in Wash-
ington College during this time.
The majority of the students were
from Rockbridge County. Very
few Washington College men were
non-Virginians. The faculty con-
sisted of six men, one of whom was
the president of the college.

The election of Abraham Lin-
coln in 1860 saw the end of the
quiet, meditative life of the Wash-
ington College student. Students
began to express war sentiments
regarding secession and even
started to take issue with the
people of Lexington, whose strong
attachment to the Union had led
them to vote for John Bell of the
Union Party in the 1860 election.

The people of Rockbridge Coun-
ty did not lose hope in Unionism

Last week I promised to write
some really wicked things about the
dens of vice that
neighboring insti-
tutions are
spawning in ap-
palling numbers
in the forms of
smokers. A week’s
thought, however,
has changed my
mind. “There is
enough reform
going on,” I said
to myself. “Too
much will leave
the next generation with nothing to
fight.”

So what I know about the sin and
depravity that lurks behind smoker
doors will not be revealed at this
time. I never have been one to de-
prive the world’s unborn of a play-
thing. Thus my legacy will be—an
unreformed institution, the college
smoker.

This altruistic move on my part
forces me into less fertile pastures,
for now I must return to our tra-
ditional campus in search of subject.
The subjects abound—but alas, the
time is not right.

I thought first of writing on “Ques-
tions the College Bowl Missed,”
like “What happened on November

Secondly, if we do withstand this
blow, we shall not retain enough
former knowledge to rebuild our
economy and society to meet and
surge beyond the present day-
standards of civilization.

It is the belief of many intelli-
gent and well-informed persons
that we should assume the worst.
This implies that if we are pre-
pared to receive a nuclear attack,
although it might not ever occur,
we can possibly prevent total ex-
termination.

This point leads me to a compar-
ison between our means of sur-
vival and the lives of our earliest
forebears. As governments, pri-
vate industries and families find
security and salvation in bomb-
shelters, so did primitive man
depend upon caves and under-
ground dwellings for protection.
We have reverted to a pattern of
life from which our  ancesters
slowly evolved. The enormous

I have decided to wait until our
group of varsity scholars is seen
from coast-to-coast.

Then, I thought it might be fun
to think up some questions for
John Paul’s proposed leadership

and besides, I really think his idea

so all the Big Clique has to do is
have someone on the inside with a

funding the proposed poll tax the
EC could send that cash to the IBM,
their stock would go up, and all
students would get double benefits—
the right man in office and increased
dividends.

But these comments seem either a
little premature or a bit stale. About
the only thing I can see that needs
some ripping criticism right now is
the good old Student Library Com-
mittee.

I'd really like to know how
many people are losing sleep about
having to appear before this left-

don’t return the locked reserve
books by 4:30 a.m. or whatever
time the books are due.

I can just imagine some poor guy
who has gone through all the tor-

these precious volumes (trial by

by some professor’s kid on his roller
skates as he rushes to get the book
back.

Instead of being able to put up a
dime per hour (which, by the way,
is used by the SLC to build up
the pornography collection in the
Rare Books Room), the victim of
fate will be forced to face his peers,
who will browbeat him until he
weakens, then sentence him to dust-
ing books on the fourth level for the
remainder of the semester.

Education
Improves
Liberty

By ROBERT C. KETCHAM

Tuesday Columnist

The new and increasing dangers
of our time have caused many to
refer to this era as the Age of
Anxiety. With heightened fear of
the bomb, of our country’s position
in Berlin and in other parts of the
world where rising expectations are
evidencing themselves, Americans
are caught up in situations which
old fashioned remedies of isolation
or war cannot correct.

With an increase in tension comes
a resulting increase in fear. The two
big governments caught up in these
present situations, often called
“crises,” because of their confiicting
ideologies capitalize on the greater
fear by an increase in propaganda.
Nor is this propaganda only aimed
at those on the other side or at
those nations not overtly affiliated,
so-called “neutrals.”

The USA’s own President Ken-
nedy often uses propaganda on his
own people to achive his ends.

How was the President able to get
his foreign aid bill through Congress
or that huge amount requested for
increased military expenditures?
And further witness the passing of
the National Defense Act which is
more properly called an education
bill but with its different label en-
countered little difficulty in getting
through Congress.

In fact, much of what we as citi-
zens receive from the government is
propaganda. The government is not
educating the people about its un-
dertakings and the people surely
cannot educate the government.

It would seem that leaders in a
leading democratic country have re-
sorted to tactics used by other na-
tions cut from a different mold. Our
nation was built around the concept
of an informed and educated elec-
torate. To impose on the nation’s
people a propaganda based on fear
is not the proper approach. Such a
method emanating from our gov-
ernment presupposes that Americans
cannot understand the reasons but
must be prodded by fear.

Two ideas suggest themselves at
this point. First, as Americans
we have been told that we should
have a fear of communism rather
than a fear of what causes com-
munism. The second is that many
there are who hate communism
not because it betrayed the revo-
lution but because it is the revo-
lution.

The fear of communism per se
is used as a scapegoat by many per-
sons today for all that is wrong
both in America and in other na-
tions who are in our camp, were in
our camp, or are camping out.

Is it too much nowadays to assume
that Americans cannot understand
the world today with its power
struggle and rising expectations, that
the nation must be rallied to the
menace in the name of pure fear?

Americans have traditionally been
known as individuals who believe
in action and lawful order. They
are a nation born out of revolution.
Our country needs education in the
things that cause communism and
not indoctrination. It wants to un-
derstand what is going on in Ber-
lin and therefore needs a teacher
rather than headline and vacuous-
ness.

Americans know that their
country is the nation which others
use as a yardstick for progress,
that their freedom is admired as
an idea by many persons, even
Hungarians and most recently,
| Syrians. They may know such

Generals’ Bench Strength Stops F & M

Second-Half Burst Routs
Diplomats, 40-0; R-M Next

Bench strength, which carried W&L to an unbeaten season
last year, paid off again Saturday.

Coach Lee McLaughlin called on 45 players as the Gen-
erals swept Franklin and Marshall completely off the held, 40-0.

With Charlie Gummey and Steve*

Suttle leading the way, Washington
and Lee registered its second victory
of the season and its twelfth in a
row.

Unlike the Hampden-Sydney
game, the backs got their downfield
blocking, Saturday, and took ad-
vantage of it.

Suttle scored the opening touch-
down as he raced 21 yards after
Gummey had recovered a F&M
fumble.

Late in the second quarter, Gum-
mey ended a fifty yard drive by go-
ing over from the seven. He then
made his second conversion of the |
afternoon giving the Generals a 16- |
0 half-time lead.

Gummey Again

The heat and the platooning of
W&L’s four teams began to take
effect on Franklin and Marshall’s
tough line midway in _ the third
quarter. Gummey scored his 16th
point of the day as he dove across
from the three.

Later in the quarter, senior half-
back Jim Hickey took a Franklin
and Marshall punt and outran every-
one, as he went 84 yards for W&L’s
fourth touchdown.

Lane Scores

Chuck Lane opened the fourth
quarter with another long scoring
jaunt, this one for 74 yards, and
John Pearson scored the final touch-
down on a 37-yard pass from A. J.
Barranco.

Coach Lee McLaughlin again
praised the defensive work of his
three teams. Besides holding F&M
to 57 yards on the ground and a
hundred yards through the air,
W&L intercepted three passes and
recovered three fumbles.

He went on to say that there were
no serious injuries, and that the
Generals should be in top form for
their homecoming game against Ran-
dolph-Macon next Saturday.

“As far as the Macon game is
concerned,” McLaughlin added, “that
depends on the boys’ attitude when
we take the field Saturday.”

The General head mentor said he
was especially pleased with the
showing of his reserves in the F&M
game and indicated he may use more
of his bench strength in future con-
tests.

Sports Star Of The Week

Coaches Pick
Gummey As
Week’s Best

“As fine a football player as I’ve
coached here at W&L”—this was
accolade accorded General halfback
Charlie Gummey after the fleet-
footed junior from Wilmington, Del.,
led the unbeaten Generals to a
40-0 victory over Franklin and Mar-
shall Saturday.

Gummey, seeing only brief action
in the runaway contest, amassed a
total of 16 points to lead the Gener-
al’s spirited offensive attack.

 

He scored on touchdown runs of
seven and three yards, and added
a pair of two-point conversions.

Gummey also completed his only
pass attempt and recovered one F&M
fumble. He finished with a net rush-
ing gain of 34 yards in a relatively
few number of carries.

Gummey doesn’t confine his ath-
letic prowess to the gridiron. He is
one of the mainstays of the W&L
swimming team and a_ standout
midfielder for coach Bob McHenry’s
lacrosse squad—despite having no
no lacrosse experience prior to en-

 

tering Washington and Lee.

Heavier Ferrum Eleven
Tops Baby Generals, 33-0

Ferrum Junior College seemed to
be in a class by itself as they whip-
ped the Freshman football team,
33-0, at Ferrum, Virginia, last Sat-
urday.

Ferrum had nine starters that
weighed over two hundred pounds
and three strong teams that made
it a discouraging afternoon for the
Baby Generals.

Ferrum Dominates

The Freshman controlled the ball
for only 10 plays in the first half,
while Ferrum dominated play and

{scored 21 points.

W&L made its only long drive
of the afternoon when it marched
from its ten to Ferrum’s 20 behind
the running of Skip Chase and the
passing of Sammy Simpson to Billy
Davis.

Ferrum was led by Dick Zulling,
a 225-pound fullback who scored

| twice on runs of 8 and 46 yards, and

| by 190-pound halfback Ken Wil-

bourne who caught two touchdown
passes.

Coach Swan said that although
| they were too much for our small

NO PLACE TO GO—General halfback Charley unser is surrounded by | team, the boys hit just as hard and
Franklin and Marshall tacklers during W&L-F&M game Saturday. This | refused to quit. He emphasized that

didn’t happen often—Gummey eluded tacklers most of the afternoon,

there are no more outside scrim-

scoring 16 points and leading the Generals to a 40-0 triumph. Gummey | mages and that the rest of the games,
was named “Sports § Star of the Week” for his performance.

X-C Team, 21-31

The Washington and Lee cross-
country team bowed to Franklin
and Marshall, Saturday, by a score
of 23-31.

Shank Second
The first place went to F&M’s
O’Connor who edged out Mike

Shank of the Generals. Mac Brown-
lee, Rick Rodgers, Norm Young-
blood, and Andy Kirkpatrick placed
fourth, seventh, eighth, and tenth
for Washington and Lee.

The meet was extremely close,
but fifth and sixth place finishes
gave Marshall the necessary mar-
gin for victory.

Next Saturday afternoon the Gen-
erals face the Hornets of Lynch-

 

burg College on the W&L course.

Academic Improvement at

Has Been Noticeable During Last Five Years
(Continued from page 1)

class rooms, library and display facilities, and general facilities, including

an observatory for physics, a vivarium and greenhouse for biology, a

seismology room for geology and an instrumental analysis laboratory for

chemistry.

Aside from its value to the science department the new building will
also be significant to the journalism and communications department.

Once the physics and pre-engineering departments vacate their present
location in Reid Hall, that building will be remodeled and used principally
by the journalism department for classrooms and studios.

Students Doing Honors Work Increases

Another possible measure of improvement on the individual level can
be seen in the number of students who did honors work last year, 42, as

opposed to 25 in 1957.

There has also been an average increase of two a year in the number

of Ph.D.’s on the faculty since 1957.

An Increase in the R. E. Lee Research Fund

Another valuable item in the overall improvement picture, has been
an increase in the Robert E. Lee: Research Fund for undergraduate re-
search activities. .This was initially started to promote faculty research
activities in which promising undergraduates could take part as research

assistants or apprentices.

These, that I have stated, are just a few of the ways and means in
which Washington and Lee is improving by refusing to remain stagnate,
but moving ahead at a pace equal to that of the incoming ability.

With the wide range of ability that W&L admissions men have been
applying, it is obvious that the University can and will move in only one

direction.
That direction is AHEAD.

rings to the student body.

Last year the Committee raised
enough money to provide a schol-
arship for a freshman in the class
of 1965.

At the present time there are
thirteen members of the Committee.
There is need for five to eight new
members, a spokesman said.

things but at the present time
they do not realize them.

The realization is diffused by the
negative thought or fear. Our society
is confronted by an expanding im-
perialism, which is which is Soviet
Russia, and by an expanding ideol-
ogy, which is Soviet communism.
But just as the Russians must real-
ize that the US is militarily strong
and committed to fight for access
routes to Berlin so must the Amer-
ican realize that the Soviet Ideology
cannot be smashed by atomic bombs
but by a strong ideology and de-
mocracy.

As Americans we must meet the
Soviet Ideology with a better ideol-
ogy. We cannot be true to ourselves
or to freedom by remaining in a
preoccupied state of fear. For under-
neath the preoccupation with Russia
several great and fundamental his-
torical forces are moving which will
put our institutions and our demo-
cratic faith to the test.

To cry out in fear and to feel so
insignificant as an individual to say
that “it does not matter what I do”
misses the question and the solution.

It is easy, granted, to overlook
the basic issues of keeping and
spreading democracy when the
moral leader of our country gives
his people propaganda served up
in fear.

We are a nation changed, for ex-
ample, by the last depression. In
1932 the government started off to
show that our institutions were suf-
ficiently flexible to care for all the
people’s wellfare. But what did we

Education, Not Indoctrination,

Needed For People Of America

get? The demonstration was never
made and we instead have the pres-
sure group state, caring for the
welfare of those organized enough to
put on the pressure.

America is still the hope of man-
kind; and it follows that America’s
hope is in the educational process
where one learns to understand,
evaluate and question.

Example: Is the tariff hurting the
farmers? Then is The Answer to do
what we are doing, that is, retain
the tariff and subsidize the farmer?
Are administered prices hurting la-
bor? Is The Answer in what we are
doing; that is, striving for admin-
istered wages too?

Questions such as the above are
matters. One would be a fool to
be at ease today about those mat-
ters or communism. But Ameri-
cans must not allow themselves to
be overcome by fear and therefore
paralyzed.

One thing is certain, only by eval-
uating and improving the institu-
tional structure in our own country
can we hope for a better democracy
in time.

Pure fear is not the answer. The
solution lies in an education and un-
derstanding of what causes the com-
munist ideology to continue growing
and an espousal of our own strong-

er ideology.

I do not question the ability of
man to transplant the fertile seeds
of experience and learning in a
before and after relationship. I
remain extremely dubious, how-
ever, concerning the tools of na-
ture with which man must rebuild
his empire.

Again, in comparison, a land
decimated by explosions, fire and
radiation is similar to the tangled
wilderness that our forefathers
faced. The utensils, not the ability,
would prevent the revival of an

advanced culture.

If the world is to be devastated

by the thoughts and actions of nu-
clear warfare, then man must be
prepared to start afresh, for this
cycle of civilization is terminated.
