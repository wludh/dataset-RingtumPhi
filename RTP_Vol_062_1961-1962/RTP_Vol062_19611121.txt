Debaters Win Regionals

By JULIAN MARKHAM
News Editor
The Washington and Lee debate team triumphed over the
top debating powers in the state last weekend to win the Vir-
ginia Debate Championship for the second consecutive year.
The Championship was held in connection with the Tau Kappa

 

Alpha Tournament staged at Bridgewater College.

Debating the question, “Resolved:*
That labor organizations should come
under the jurisdictions of anti-trust
legislation,” the team posted a 7-1
record in the competition. Washing-
ton and Lee was represented on the
negative side by Al Eckes and Bill
Noell. This team compiled a 4-0
competitive record. Debating the
affirmative were Bill Boardman and
Jay Clark who posted a 3-1 record
for the tournament.

As a tribute to their oratorical
abilities, Al Eckes and Bill Noell
tied for second place overall in the
tournament, while alternate Richard
McEnally was awarded third place
overall, negative division. Similar-
ly, achieving distinction for their
outstanding performances were Bill
Boardman and Jay Clark who placed
third and fourth respectively overall
in the affirmative division. Debate
Coach William Chaffin noted that
this the first time in regional history
everyone on a particular school team
had won recognition for individual
speaking merit. The W&L team
took five of eight awards.

The Washington and Lee alternate
team included Charles McCord, John
Lackey, Gay Reading, and Richard
McEnally.

The debate team completed their
tournament victory after a sharp
political battle on the convention
floor, by securing the 1962 Tau Kap-
pa Alpha Regional Debate Tourna-
ment on the Washington and Lee
campus, Also, team captain Bill
Boardman was elected president of
the Virginia Regional of Tau Kappa
Alpha.

Reflecting upon W&L’s tremen-
dous success at Bridgewater, Mr.
Chaffin said, “Of course, I am de-
lighted with the results of the tour-
nament. However, our primary ob-
ject in intercollegiate debate is not
just the winning of tournaments, but
to expose as many interested stu-
dents as possible to collegiate debate
and discussion. It is an educational
process.”

Future plans of the debate team
include tournaments at New York
University and Duke University later
in the winter.

 

Placement
Interview

On Wednesday, November 29, Mr.
Almand Coleman of the University
of Virginia Graduate School of Busi-
ness Administration will be on the
campus to talk with seniors interest-
ed in the Graduate School of Busi-
ness. Mr. Coleman will discuss the
program leading to the Master’s de-
gree of Business Administration, a
two-year course of training for ad-
ministrative responsibilities.

The program is open without
course or concentration prerequisites
to qualified college graduates. All
interested seniors are urged to make
appointments at the Placement Of-
fice to meet with Mr. Coleman.

 

 

Cole Announces

Faculty-Passed
King Resolution

The contents of a faculty resolu-
tion dealing with a proposed invi-
tation to Dr. Martin Luther King
to take part in a Washington and
Lee University student religious
seminar were announced today.

The resolution, passed by a major-
ity vote of the faculty at a regularly-
scheduled meeting on November 6,
was forwarded to the Board of Trus-
tees by President Fred C. Cole at
the request of the faculty. The facul-
ty asked President Cole to announce
publicly the resolution’s contents
only after the Board has had oppor-
tunity to receive the resolution
through normal channels.

The resolution stated:

“The faculty of Washington and
Lee University expressed its gen-
uine regret at the decision of the
Board of Trustees that prevents
the Christian Asociation from ex-
tending to Dr. Martin Luther King
an invitation to speak at the uni-
versity. This decision, in the opin-
ion of the faculty, seriously limits
the freedom of inquiry that should
prevail in an institution of higher
learning, and denies to students
the opportunity to learn and judge
for themselves, even upon issues
of controversy.”

James R. Caskie of Lynchburg,
rector of the board, acknowledged
receipt of the faculty resolution and
emphasized the faculty’s preroga-
tive to disagree with action by the
Board of Trustees.

“In every instance, the Board of
Trustees endeavors to act in what
it considers the best interests of
Washington and Lee University,”
Caskie declared. “In this case, there
exists an honest difference of opin-
ion as to what course of action best
serves the interest of the Univer-
sity.”

The rector praised the faculty’s
concern for “freedom of inquiry” on
the Washington and Lee campus.

“It is good that such a differ-
ence of opinion can take place in
an atmosphere of mutual respect,”
Caskie said. “It is wholesome that
the avenues of communication be-
tween the faculty and the board
remain free and open.”

The issue stemmed from a request
by the student University Christian
Association for permission to invite
the widely-known Negro integra-
tionist to take part in one of a
series of seminars in religion aimed
at relating Christianity to major
current issues. A faculty Committee
on Christian Work approved the pro-
posed invitation but referred the
matter to the Board of Trustees for
its approval. The Board declined to
approve the proposed invitation.

EMPHASIS

W&L Produces Great Unsubsidized Teams

By JOHN ALLGOOD

As W&L’s football team rolls along with an 18-game string without
a loss, one stops to wonder: How ean a school without subsidized athletics
like Washington and Lee produce such a fine team?

Or for that matter: How can a school without subsidized athletics
produce an overall record in 12 intercollegiate sports of 73 wins and
47 losses and 1 tie (a percentage of .608) like W&L’s teams compiled
in 1960-61?

Of course, the obvious answer is that W&L has good athletes.
But this wasn’t always the case here. One needs to look back only
five or six years to find a group of athletes at W&L who thought
keeping in condition was just a joke.

 

 

=

BERR

The success of the Washington and Lee athletic program can be main-
ly attributed to the program itself and the philosophy behind it.

All sports are treated equal at W&L. Minor sports such as wrestling,
swimming, and lacrosse aren’t shut up in a closet while the school
concentrates on producing winning football, basketball, and baseball
teams. All sports share alike here. There is no favoritism.

A second point is that Washington and Lee’s athletic program is
for the benefit of the students not for the benefit of the public. (Al-
though the public certainly has been enjoying the 5-Star Generals’
football win skein.)

“We're not here to put on a show,” said athletic director E. P.
“Cy” Twombly. “We're here to give our students a healthful form of
recreation.”

W&L students are encouraged to come out for sports just “for the
fun” of participating. They don’t have to play a sport to get through
school. The sports program is there for their benefit. A fine example
of playing sports “for fun” was the freshman football team.

Despite a 0-6 season the freshman gave Staunton Military Academy,
the Military League’s best team, a scare by holding it to a 7-0 halftime
lead. SMA went on to win, 28-0, but the freshmen battled fiercely all
the way.

On this freshman squad were four boys who had never played foot-
ball before. This in itself is quite a tribute to any school’s athletic pro-
gram when boys come out for varsity sports for the first time in college.

Mental attitude is another important contributing factor to the suc-
cess of Washington and Lee’s athletic program.

Take that group of athletes of five or six years ago who thought
keeping in shape was just a joke. They really didn’t care whether the
teams won or lost. They just took a whirl at playing and if they
didn’t like it, they quit. Very rarely did anyone outside the sopho-
more or freshman classes participate in intercollegiate sports.

In 1957 the worm turned. In came a new group of athletes and in
came a new football coach, Lee McLaughlin.

Eighteen of the freshmen who played football on the one-win 1958
team under McLaughlin are playing on his undefeated team today.
And a better attitude could not be found anywhere in the country.
These boys want to win, sure, but they also play for the mere enjoy-
ment of playing. They believe in the W&L program and themselves,
consequently, they are winning—winning like mad.

This exuberant spirit has overflown into the student body. Again

citing five or six years ago, Wilson Field looked like a tomb on Sat-
urday afternoon when the Generals had a home football game. Now the
stands are filled with anywhere from 2,500 to 6,000 spectators.

Still one wonders: Where does a non-subsidized school get its ath-
letes?

This is one of the strong points of the new program—the university
does not have to compromise its academic standards to obtain good
athletes.

True, W&L does not get the cream of the crop of athletes who are
picked off by the big colleges with plenty of money, but the athletes
it does get give it just as good a program as any other college.

Athletic success boils down to a few basic ingredients: good mental
attitude, a desire to play, enthusiasm, and a sprinkling of ability. Wash-

ington and Lee has all these ingredents, and it has a very successful
athletic program,

|For Control Group

 

 

|

Applications Rise

Steve Suttle, Secretary of the EC,
announced today that he was en-
couraged by the increase in appli-
cations for the Student Control
Committee. Before this time, con-
cern was expressed for the lack of
student interest in the group.

The Student Control Committee,
created by the Faculty two weeks
ago, will investigate and take ap-
propriate action on conduct offenses.
Suttle stated that he was particular-
ly impressed with the qualifications
of the applicants and that selection
will be difficult. The committee will
consist of two seniors, one junior,
and one sophomore with a represen-
tative from the Law School.

Applications for membership on
the committee must be submitted to
Steve Suttle at the Delt House no
later than Wednesday. They should
contain the student’s qualifications
and reasons for wanting to serve
with the group.

The group will be a large step
forward in the area of student self-
government. It will place the re-
sponsibility for good conduct on
more of a student to student basis.
However, this group will largely
determine the feasibility of more
self-discipline and self-government
by the students.

The Student Control Committee
is on a trial basis and is subject to
review at any time by the Adminis-
trative Committee of the Faculty.

No set penalties have been out-
lined by the group, and the commit-
tee will always act with regard to
circumstances. This is similar to the
procedure followed by the Faculty
Administrative Committee.

 

 

 

Group To Voice
Student Opinion

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

Dance-Board Vice-President
Frank Young announced to-
day the new members of the
recently-formed Dance Board
Advisory Council.

The group, composed of
twenty-five members, was chos-
en from a field of fifty appli-

cants.

The Advisory Council will
serve as a means of relating the

actions of the Dance Board
to the students. In carrying out this
objective the members will recom-
mend bands and entertainers in
popular demand by the student
body, will assist in the sale of Fancy
Dress costumes and aid the Dance
Set vice-presidents in the decorating
of the gymnasium.

In short, the committee will be
the link between the student body
and the Dance Board and faculty.

The new members of the commit-
tee are as follows:

Pete Alford, Phi Psi sophomore;
A. J. Barranco, SAE sophomore;
Joe Bear, Phi Delt freshman; Dave
Bevans, PiKA junior; Bill Board-
man,, Beta junior; Al Byrne, SAE
freshman; Don Campbell, SAE jun-
ior; Jay Clark, Phi Gam sophomore;
Tom Edwards; Phi Delt junior; John
Furness, Independent sophomore;
Barry Greene, ZBT sophomore; Ken
Greer, KA sophomore; Steve Guild,
Kappa Sig junior; Bob Hart, SAE
junior; Andy Hyde, KA sophomore;
Carroll Klingelhofer, Delt freshman;
Andy Nea, Phi Gam junior; Tom
Rains, KA junior; Tony Schlesinger,
ZBT junior; James Slay, Delt fresh-
man; Mike Spalding, Phi Delt sen-
ior; Barry Stanier, Phi Psi sophmore;
Jim Stott, DU junior; Mike Suss-
man, ZBT junior; Jim Wallenstein,
ZBT sophomore.

Young, as Vice-President of the
Dance Board, will serve as president

| of the Advisory Council. Members of

the group will remain on the Coun-
cil until their graduation from W&L.
This means that freshmen that are
selected will serve for four years.
In addition, it is expected that the
Vice-President of the Dance Board
will be chosen from those on the
Council and that membership in the
group will be a prerequisite for
that office.

“The Dance’ Board,” stated
Young, “believes that the mem-
bers of the Council are a good
representation of the student body
and will provide a cross-section of
student opinion. We hope that this
committee can serve in full capaci-
ty to relate the desires of the stu-
dent body to the Dance Board.
The Board was very pleased with

Lack Of Interest Discouraging

The apparent lack of interest that has been shown by Wash-
ington and Lee’s Student Body in the efforts of the Executive
Committee to form a Student Control Committee is indeed a
discouraging fact.

Equally discouraging is the fact that as of yesterday not
a single proposal had been submitted to the Reform Committee
for study of possible Constitutional revision.

 

The members of the Executive Committee have worked |
|

long and hard in getting the Administration to approve the |
Student Control Committee.

The faculty expressed a definite trust in the students
of Washington and Lee when they gave their approval
of this measure. Does it not seem to be a discouraging
fact that the students can’t live up to that trust?

Washington and Lee students yell and scream for Constitu- |
tional Revision. How many students have even bothered to|
read the present Constitution? We believe that not many stu- |
dents have taken the time to do so, and that the pitiful thing is.
that many of them won’t take the time to read the Constitution, |
much less submit proposals for revision. (The fact that not a
single proposal for revision has been submitted testifies to this
statement. )

Are the students of Washington and Lee so disinterested in
their government that they resist all efforts that are made to
give them more voice in disciplinary affairs? We would like to
hope that the above is not true, but from the amount of support
that has been given the E.C. it appears that W&L does indeed
have a disinterested student body.

Steve Suttle, secretary of the Student Body, told the Ring-
tum Phi yesterday that the proposals for Constitutional revi-
sion and applicaions for the Student Control Committee should
be submitted to him by tomorrow.

We hope that the students of W&L do not betray the trust
shown by the faculty’s approval of the Control Committee;
we hope that those students who wish Constitutional revision
will get busy and submit their proposals.

Without this basic support from the Student Body, The
Executive Committee cannot hope to accomplish any positive
goals.

We therefore issue this statement to the students of W&L:

Washington and Lee students, get on the ball. Support the
Executive Committee in their efforts. Apply for and support
the Student Control Committee—it’s to your best interests.
Students, it’s time for each and every one of you to put up or
shut up.

Fletcher’s Talk

“A pledge has a right to be treated as a man seeking an
education,” Mr. Richard Fletcher, chief executive of the Sigma
Nu Fraternity, said in a speech to W&L fraternity pledges last
Thursday.

Mr. Fletcher, we feel, has issued a clear-cut warning to the
18 fraternities here, and we hope that both the IFC and frater-
nity men heed his suggestion.

With Help Week just around the corner, the IFC Help
Week Committee would do well to remember Mr. Fletcher’s
words.

We agree with the speaker in his statement that hazing is
‘‘a practice we associate with kids.”

The IFC needs to strengthen its rules on Help Week to
insure that the practice of hazing is done away with at W&L.

Every year there seem to be one or two incidents where
some member or members of some fraternity “forget” these
rules.

It is our hope that the Help Week Committee comes up
with a positive set of proposals and that the fraternities ap-
prove these suggestions.

The IFC is to be commended on having Mr. Fletcher speak
to the freshmen pledges. Perhaps this speech could become
an annual occasion, for we feel that the giving of this speech
was a step in the right direction for the IFC.

Thanks

The approval that has been expressed concerning the pub-
lication of the article on W&L’s Honor System is indeed en-
couraging to the Editorial Board of the Tuesday Edition.

We think that Dr. Coulling’s article hit home when he
wrote that the Honor System is ‘‘ours only to preserve.” We
encourage every Washington and Lee student to read this
article. (Extra copies of last Tuesday’s paper are available
in limited supply.)

Again, we would like to thank Dr. Coulling for his effort,
and we thank those students who commended us on the pub-
lishing of this article.

As a further pledge of the Tuesday Edition’s effort to
give W&L an informative newspaper, we assure each student
that our paper will continue to publish articles such as Dr.
Coulling’s.

We sincerely urge all persons who are interested in writing

 

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

W&L Should Build Fallout Shelter

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

With lousy weather, a good foot-
ball team, and the impending vaca-
tion all happening
about the same
time it’s hard to
find something to
write about. But
then I was reading
the Hollins news-
paper about some
fireside chats that
the president has
had down there,
and something
struck me as vital.
The response to
STUD on this campus has_ been
hearty, but we’re yet to hear from
any of the girls’ schools about aux-
illary organizations. This may be
because of a circulation defect, but
nevertheless some alternative plan
of survival should be tendered at
this time. This is where the presi-
dent of Hollins comes in, for last
week he deemed fallout important
enough to discuss possible shelter
construction at Hollins.

What is being done here to pro-
vide for the safety of Washington
and Lee students in the event of
atomic attack? Of course, everyone
who takes geology knows where the
county caves are, but so do a lot
of people in the county. And the
vast majority of students know of no
really safe place to hide. The pos-
sible exception to this is the fra-
ternity man who knows that his
house basement has successfully re-
pelled attacks from time immemorial,
but none of these attacks were
atomic.

I think that the situation is
now critical, and if left unthought
about, can do nothing but worsen.
Just think of the things around
here that a post-bomb civiliza-
tion could not function without.
And think of what a crime against
humanity it would be if Wash-
ington and Lee, through negli-
gence, left all our relics (and our-
selves) to fate when the bomb
comes to Lexington. We shouldn’t
delude ourselves into thinking that
Lexington is not a strategic tar-
get, It definitely is, if for no other
reason than it is the home of the
only prints of “Brother Rat”
known to exist.

   

Craven

Right now we have the chance to
act. While you’re home on vacation,
buy a gun. Bring it back to school
with you. And then on Monday the
whole student body will meet be-
hind the law school, bearing arms.
With our sleeves rolled up we can
overpower all the workmen at the
new building, and force the archi-
tect and contractor to redesign the
building into a hugh shelter. Using
all the students trained in ROTC

technique we can keep guards post- |
ed until the job is finished. Since
we'll already be armed we won't!
have to worry about the problem of |
shooting our neighbors in case of |
attack. We’ll simply shoot them be- |
fore the attack in order to neatly |
dispose of that question. While we’re |

at it we can gun down a few pro-
fessors, just to demonstrate our
power. Then maybe we could get
the science majors to work to de-
sign a W&L bomb with which to
retaliate. And if it works out may-
be we can agress just a little to
show the world that you can’t push

W&L men around. And if we agress,
then we will have to be recognized
as a national power, and get a seat
in the UN, and then submit our
plan for a Secretariat, and wreck
that group, and then....

Happy Thanksgiving. You
have the turkey.

Dear Mr Goodwin:

The following is what I consider
to be something of use to you and
your paper.

Foreign caparthagos and integral
meimstroms invading our daily ac-
tivity is something one should never
take lightly. But here, on the W&L
campus, one immediately becomes
aware of such disastrous apathy. To
wit, this lethargic nethralogy is ep-
itomized by the articles published in
the Ping Rum Thi.

For weeks now, the headlines have
mippened with such flashy newsy
tidbits as “X, Y, and Zed, Plan
Affair”! Quallog, thought I a repe-
tition of history on our wallowed
campus! Surruptitiously looking to
my left, (a gauche movement for a
rightist!) in fear of spotting a teen-
age Bircher lurking in the corner,
posing as a left-over from Openings,
I read on and found the “Affair”
merely dealt with Fancy Dress, due
to be held in February. There was a

done, and by and large, disinterested.

The most recent Occasional Pap-
er to come out from the Center is
written by Henrich Kronstein en-
titled, “Government and Business in
International Trade.” Dr. Kronstein
is both a professor of law at George-
town University in Washington,
D.C., and at Frankfurt University,
Germany. Sinces he divides his time
between Germany and the U.S. he
seems to have acquired a familiar-

policy from both the outside and
the inside.

The phamplet, only 10 pages
long, certainly merits reading by
those interested in trade, the Re-
ciprocal Trade Agreements Act
shortly coming up for revision, or
corporations, But the big question
most important to philosophers
and logicians, it seems to me, is
the difference between Govern-

Like Amery,
We Must Spy
On Big Bear

A close study of American Foreign
Policy, with regard to our present
position in inter-
national affairs,
would eventually
lead one to at-
tempt to the es-
tablishment of a
cause and eect
relationship. With
this idea in mind,
I submit to my
readers the par-

   

aa . af able of Little
Knight Amery.
Once upon a

time, there came a small boy to live
in the Noisy Forest. His name was
Little Amery, and he was very well
known in the Noisy Forest.

Another very important person
there was a big brown bear, they
called him “Reddy.” Reddy was very
grim indeed, and he was addicted to
eating very much. His mother had
always told him: “The more you
eat, the stronger you will become”—
never having read a book by Dr.
Spock. And he had a reputation to
keep up. So he went and swallowed
whatever he could find. Nobody
loved him very much for it, but he
did not care.

Little Amery had not been brought
up on those lines. On the whole,
he was a kind boy, even if he did
tend to be somewhat complacent
and to talk too much. He was very
wary of Reddy, because he had been
taught by his mother that gentlemen
always smile. Reddy never smiled,
and therefore, Amery knew that he
could not trust him. And soon Reddy
realized that he could not catch
Little Amery and eat him.

But one fine summer day, after
having read a book by Dale Car-
negie, the bear decided to change
his manners. Reddy began to smile
broadly and exude his manners.
Reddy began to smile broadly and
exude benevolence through every
pore. Everybody was astonished, but
most of all Little Amery. At first,
he was very suspicious. But after-
ward, he remembered what he had
been told as a child: “What smiles
is a gentleman and may be trusted!”
And he began at once to get friend-
ly with Reddy and got to like him.
Reddy’s grin showed clearly that
he was one of the boys and a very
good chap. So Little Amery went to
see Reddy, and in the evening he
curled up in Reddy’s cave to spend
the night there.

In the morning, Reddy called his
wife and told her: “I had a real
gentleman for supper last night. I

Sports Star Of The Week

 

Lanny Butler eludes Frederick tacklers on a long run.

Knight Named All-State;
Breaks Scoring Record

This week’s Sports Star is Dave |
Knight, competitive center forward
on Coach Lyles’ soccer team.

Scores Three

Knight, a four-year’ veteran,
poured in three goals in the booters
win over VPI at the State tourna-
ment last Saturday night. The Gen-
erals overpowered the Gobblers 5-1
to capture third place honors in the
tourney. Virginia edged Lynchburg
College 2-1 in the finals to assert
state soccer supremacy.

Sets Record

Knight has tallied 15 goals this
season for the booters and in do-
ing so set a school scoring record.
For his outstanding play in the
tournament he was named by the
opposing coaches to the All-Oppon-
ent team. Tom Green, W&L goalie,
also received this honor.

Coach Joe Lyles, contemplating
the loss of Knight through gradu-
ation this June, says, “I am sorry
we are losing a boy of Dave’s cali-
ber, both as a soccer player and a
gentleman.”

In the State tournament Friday the
Generals bowed to Lynchburg Col-
lege, 2-1. Freshman inside Gil Sling-| .,
erlin scored the lone W&L goal and, *
was assisted by Dave Knight.

At a meeting of the soccer team
last Friday Tom Clements and Bob
Pagano were chosen Co-Captains of
the booters for next season.

Defense Tough

Led by Tommy Keesee, Bob
Payne, and Bill Wheeler, W&L’s
blitz so frightened first string Fred-
erick quarterback James Roaves that
he didn’t get a pass off all day. Only
second stringer Shelby Spain man-
aged to get rid of the ball before
being smothered by a host of blue
jerseys.

Until Saturday W&L had been
known for its stingy rushing de-
fense (seventh in the nation among
small colleges) but its opponents
had been able to gain yardage
via the airways.

Frederick found the Generals’
front wall as tough as ever, and
elected to go to the airways. But
the new blitz foiled the Lions’ aerial
plans. In fact, the Lions picked up
only 19 yards passing for the game.

Substract the 19 yards the Lions
lost rushing and their total offense
| equals ZERO. What more could a
coach ask of his defensive unit than
holding the opponent to ZERO
total yards.

But a great deal of this good de-
fensive play went unnoticed by the
2,500 spectators who were too busy

the officials threw their flag on
every other play. They actually
meeted out some 165 yards in pen-
alties and that total would have
been considerably higher had not
several long infractions nullified each
other.

It wasn't at all unusual during
the game for the P.A. announcer
to blast, “fourth and 48, fourth
and 40, or fourth and 42.”

Offensively W&L used Coach Mc-
laughlin’s favorite “big play” to gain
an 18-0 halftime lead and then
added two hard fought touchdowns.

Gummey Scores

Halfback Charlie Gummey, one of
the state’s leading scorers with 42
points, put the Generals on the
scoreboard with only 2:30 gone in
the first period. The speedy back
grabbed a Roaves pass at the W&L
45 and sped 55 yards untouched for
the Generals’ first touchdown.

Frederick opened the touchdown
gates itself early in the second
period when it handed W&L the
football at the Frederick 21 on a
fumble.

It took quarterback Steve Suttle,
who put on a deft offensive show
by gaining 69 yards in six carries,
only three plays to scoot 17 yards
for the score. On the scoring play

tacklers he began to weave in-and-
out and finally dashed into the end
zone standing up.

Suttle Again

A short punt which rolled dead on
the Frederick 42 set up the Generals’
third touchdown. Suttle was the
hero again, racing the final 30 yards
on the same play he baffled Freder-
ick earlier.

In the five-play drive, Suttle ac-
counted for 39 of the 42 yards, carry-
ing the ball on all but one play.

The second half produced more
exciting football both offiensively
and defensively.

As the game went along the Gen-
erals’ defense seemed to get better.
Frederick picked up five first downs,
three yards rushing, and 23 yards
passing the first half.

In the second half, however, Fred-
erick couldn’t get its offense past
the line of scrimmage. It earned
only one first down, lost 22 yards
rushing and even lost four yards
passing.

Offensively the Generals drove 79
and 44 yards for touchdowns.

Smothers Frederick Attack, 30-0

In both drives key fourth down
gambles kept the marches under
way.

With fourth and two at the Fred-
erick 31, halfback Jim Russ raced 27
yards to the Federick 4 on a reverse.
Two plays later Russ scored from
one yard out.

Lane Runs

In the second drive quarterback
Chuck Lane bootlegged 17 yards on
a fourth and 12 situation at the
Frederick 46. Then with fourth and
one at the Frederick 20, Lane fired
a ten-yard pass to sophomore end
Buck Ogilvie to give W&L a first
down at the Lions’ ten.

Lane turned end for six yards and
then fullback Doug Martin, the Old
Dominion’s leading scorer with 46
points, burst four yards up the mid-
dle for the Generals’ final touch-
down.

Roosevelt, Brandeis, Wilson, and La-
Follette. Before that time, as Kron-
stein points out, the American so-
ciety was a force “integrated by the
enthusiastic will to build up a na-
tion of free individuals.” With the
growth of corporate power came the
question for men’s minds of how to
control it.

The most interesting aspect of this
article to me is the ability of the
writer to keep walking towards his
objective while lightly stepping on
everyone in sight, for example: he
reaffirms his belief in the value of

chidding them for letting the gov-

very areas. Dr. Kronstein is similarly
harsh on our post governmental pol-
icy toward international trade and
development, citing instances where
bureaucrats have practically immo-
bilized American businessmen try-

equitably and intelligently.

The writer presents a strong case
for private corporations and for an
integrated policy. He also raises a
question which needs more discus-
sion when he asks, “what are the
standards for determining what is
