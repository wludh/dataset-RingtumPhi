Student Opinion Varies On [FC Rush Plan

By ROGER PAINE
Friday Managing Editor
Since the IFC proposal to move
fraternity rushing up four weeks in
the school year has been released,
student bull sessions have taken a
serious turn. The proposal has
been intelligently aired at almost
every fraternity meeting and in
discussions in the dorms and in
the respective houses. Needless to
say, Rush Week touches the stu-
dents at Washington and Lee even
more closely, if possible, than the
hours of combo parties.

The student body is split up in-
to three basic groups of opinion.
One of these groups feels that
the new proposal is the best thing
for W&L and for the fraternity
system as a whole, that it far sur-
passes the old system in many
points, and that it should be passed.

The second group feels that the
present rushing system has proved
itself, that it has many strong

points, and that it would be ridic-
ulous to change. The third and
strongest group feels that the IFC
proposal should be passed, but only
because the faculty will ram some-
thing even worse down the stu-
dents’ throats if it isn’t.
The Faculty Standpoint

A good number of students firm-
ly believe that the present sys-
tem should be changed. The facul-
ty is in favor of a change because
they want to get their hands on
the incoming freshmen before the
fraternity men do. Many faculty
members feel that the average
freshman coming to W&L gets a
bad impression of what the school
is all about by drinking beer and
talking about parties for more than
a week before seeing any books or
the inside of a classroom.

Fraternity men would like to
see the system changed for a dif-
ferent reason. Dave Peters, presi-
dent of the Sigma Nu house, feels

that while it is good to assimilate
freshmen into the social life of the
school as quickly as possible, the
new system would make it easier
on the freshmen and on the fra-
ternities too. The freshmen would
have more time to get a good grasp
on the academic and social atmos-
phere at Washington and Lee, and
the fraternity men would have
more time to organize their rush
plans.

This brings up the matter of the
month-long period between the be-
ginning of school and the time
when the S and U reports come
out. This has been designated in
the IFC proposal as the time to
begin formal rushing. At present
all that has been stated by the
IFC is that any rushing during this
time would be informal. If a fra-
ternity were to have a combo party
during that time, freshmen would
be allowed to go to it, but any
moves would be left to the dis-
cretion of the freshman.

Washington and Lee Semi-Weekly Newspaper

George Honts, who led the IFC
committee which presented the
new rushing proposal, made it clear
that the present plan is only a
skeleton of what is hoped for, and
that in the coming year the neces-
sary refinements on this four week
period would be made. It is the
feeling of most fraternity men that
contact with freshmen during this
time would have to be on a casual
level and no higher. Otherwise the
four weeks would be hard on fra-
ternity men and on freshmen to
an extent not even approached
under the present system.

Tim Ireland expressed the
strongest sentiments for the group
of students who are opposed to
any change in the present system.
He said: “I’m convinced that the
present rush system is best for
W&L, and I see no valid reason
to change it. The present system
has proven itself. Any maladjust-
ment of the freshmen under the
present system would only be in-

tensified by this new system due
to the four weeks of social pressure.
I do not believe that any so-called
maladjustment now is due to the
fraternities.

“If this proposal is passed it will
be because of the fear that the re-
cent faculty decision on combos has
engendered in us, making us afraid
something worse will be forced on
us by the faculty if we don’t act
ourselves. I certainly do not think
that the new proposal should be
passed on its own merit.”

Those students in the third
group—that is, those who feel that
the proposal should be passed for
the very reason that Tim stated:
faculty pressure—point to the ac-
tions that the faculty has taken
on combos. It is obvious that they
are going to do anything they
want to, and the student body can-
not stop them, so it would he
better to pass this than to wait
until the faculty takes action.

300 Alumni
Arrive For
°62 Reunion

Over 300 alumni and their
wives are at Washington and
Lee this wekend for reunions
of the classes of 1912, 1922,
1937, and 1952.

A flurry of activities is
scheduled for the former stu-
dents, who include both aca-
demic and law school gradu-
ates. Alumni secretary William
Washburn said this year marks
the first time the Tucker Law
Lectures have been combined
with reunion activities.

“The unusual number of events
has increased our alumni interests
this year,” Washburn said. “We ex-
pect a 20 per cent increase in at-
tendance to reunion foundations this
year.”

Registration for the four classes
officially opened at 2 p.m. this after-
noon. Campus tours were conducted
by members of the Student Service
Society through the afternoon. Late
in the day President and Mrs. Fred
C. Cole held a reception for re-
turning graduates at the president’s
home.

The traditional “State of the Uni-
versity” reports by President Cole
and the university’s deans will be
given at 10 a.m. tomorrow in Lee
Chapel.

President Cole will be the featured
speaker at a 1:15 p.m. Saturday
luncheon in Evans Dining Hall for
the alumni.

Tomorrow afternoon the alumni
will have an opportunity to tour the
science building currently under
construction, and the new dorm
which is near completion. Members
of the IBM data processing staff will
give special demonstrations on
W&L’'s new IBM 1620 computer dur-
ing the afternoon.

Saturday afternoon will also see
a meeting of the Washington and Lee
Law School Association, composed
of all law alumni. Law alumni from
classes other than the reunion class-
es have been invited to attend the
meeting.

SIPA’s Baffled By Current Events Quiz

By STEVE SMITH

George Romney turned up as pres-
ident of the AFL, General Motors,
Chrysler, and Ford last week in
the SIPA current events quiz giv-
en high school students attending the
journalism conference here. (Rom-
ney is actually associated with
American Motors.)

Romney was only one of a host
of misplaced persons on the quiz. All
personalities on the list had been
prominent in some recent news
event,

Spessard Holland, senior Senator
from Florida, was thought by some-
one to be the King of the Nether-
lands.

Gen. Edwin Walker was described
as “the next man to be shot into
space.” Also in the space line was
Soviet astronaut Titov, who became
the head of the Yugoslavian govern-

|} ment, engaged in an argument with
| Khrushchev. One U.S. astronaut
| didn’t fare so well—he was named
| the boxer who killed Benny “Kid”
Paret.

Archbishop Joseph Francis Rum-
mel of New Orleans, involved in a
segregation battle, was deseribed as
a “Catholic Archbishop who surviv-
ed persecution during World War II.”
He was also called a German pian-
ist who is becoming popular in the
United States.

Katherine Anne Porter, writer who
has spent some time at W&L, was
given the post of physician to Pres-
ident Kennedy.

Newly-appointed Supreme Court
Justice Byron White was called
a Briton “who is a member of Ban
the Bomb.” Robert Weaver of the
| Housing Administration was labeled
“head of the John Birch Society; a

 

 

radical organization,” and “a Sena-
tor who attacked a civil right bill.”

James B, Reston, New York Times
columnist who attended the conven-
tion as a featured speaker, was re-
warded for his efforts by being de-
scribed as the “President of Inland
Steel.”

Bernis Owens, the PFC whose
criticism of Kennedy’s call-up of
the reservists almost earned him a
court martial, was described as “a
great polo player who just fell off
his horse” and a “U.S. playwright
who has a play off Broadway.”

The Wife of U-2 pilot Gary Pow-
ers was called the wife of a “US
spy” who recently was stricken with
food poisoning.

Perhaps the most-maligned per-
sonage on the quiz list was Miss
Loubelline, a character in the “Po-
go” comic strip who was called one
of the characters in “Smilling Jack.”

New Rush Proposals :

The proposals submitted to the Interfraternity Council

 

by their committee on rushing procedures show a good deal

of careful thought and seem to us to be sound on the whole.
We are, however, hesitant to accept the premise that un-

necessary emphasis on the social side of life in the freshman’s |
first few weeks results from the present early rush system. It

seems to us that any unhealthy emphasis on the fraternities
could best be reduced by such methods as a drastic reduction
in the amount of time required by pledge training activities in
the fall.

But the idea that a later rush will take the freshman’s mind
off social life and fraternities seems to us as a patently unsound
one. This might prove true if rush were delayed for a year,
as the faculty petition last month proposed. But any freshman
who is confronted with such an important decision for his col-
lege future, and perhaps afterwards, is bound to give it a lot of
thought and worry.

Futhermore, we feel that the informal nature of the rush
dates on the first weekend of school will take away one of the
greatest advantages of the present system. The fraternities per-
form a very important service to the University at present by
providing a means by which a man may, at the very beginning
of his Washington and Lee career, meet a large number of
upperclassmen. These acquaintances can be of great help to a
freshman, giving him a sense of belonging and assuring that
there will be men outside of his own class who will take an
interest in his personal and academic future.

We also feel that the committee missed a chance to prove
the commitment of the fraternities to the academic goals of
the University by requiring a higher level of academic per-
formance before rushing privileges are extended. Fraternity
membership is a privilege and not a right. This right should be
predicated on academic performance which assures that the
freshman is well on his way toward graduation. A .5 average
gives no such assurance, but means only that the student will
probably not flunk out his first semester.

Fraternities play an important role in the academic work of
the good students who are in the majority here, but their
influence on the weaker students is positively bad at times.
Stringent academic requirements for both pledging and ini-
tiation would go far toward removing the present feeling
among professors that the fraternities represent a force con-
trary to the academic goals of the University.

We think that the IFC committee has done a very good job
in preparing suggestions for a change in rush procedure. But
we do think it important that some way be found to preserve
our advantage in introducing the freshmen to a large number
of upperclassmen at the beginning of his four years, and that
the IFC indicates by tougher grade requirements for pledging
that the fraternities want to raise the level of their members’
academic work.

Major Roxbury

The announcement today that Major Roxbury will be
transferred to another post next year will arouse a good deal
of disappointment in the student body. Major Roxbury has
improved ROTC at W&L a great deal. He has also been an
informative and stimulating commentator on military matters
for the non-military members of the University.

We'll miss him at W&L, but the Army being what it is, we
can only wish him great success in his next post.

The EC’s Constitution

The Executive Committee, in a moment of generosity,
has decided to give the student body another chance to approve
their series of constitutional changes which failed to gain the
necessary majority vote in Thursday’s elections. As an added
attraction, they have also voted to give the student body an-
other chance to replace the Publications Board representative
with an additional representative from the junior class.

We have opposed the elimination of the Publications Board
representative because of the generally good representation
that they have given the school. Bob Payne’s election to the
post further bears out our thesis that the Publications Board
can be counted on to send a good man to the EC.

It still seems to us desirable to do away with the nominating
convention and have candidates for student body-wide elec-
tions nominated by petition. Campaigns will be more meaning-
ful if a minority who have substantial support are able to pre-
sent a candidate to make their views known even if the party
system makes his chances of winning rather slim.

The proposal to replace the dance set president, except for
Fancy Dress, with class sponsors is a more controversial one.
We believe that it will contribute to class unity and make class
officers more meaningful. But the present system does assure
competent leadership of dance sets and tends to spread the re-
sponsibility around some more. This is a question that students
will have to consider carefully in making up their minds.

The EC has worked hard on this constitution and it certainly
deserves careful consideration before voting. The new constitu-
tion does make a number of controversial changes in the way
things are done here. If students are not in favor of the whole
thing, they should vote ‘‘No”’ and wait until they have a chance
to vote on each change separately, a less convenient but more
responsive way in which to consider the matter.

By BILL ATWELL

Much has been said in the past few
weeks about assimilation at Wash-
ington and Lee. A great deal of the
talk stemmed from the election of
student body officers. The basis was
the apparent lack of assimilation for
freshmen. I would, however, like to
discuss what seems to me to be an
over-emphasis on assimilation.

What I would really like to know
is what kind of game are people
playing in the “school-spirited save
the University” campaign which
seems to be running rampant now.
Earlier in the week I heard one
boy say that he and his friends had
assimilated one student 26 times for
not speaking. The speaking tradition
is a valuable and good institution—
but isn’t 26 times a little ridiculous?

If these zealous students really
want to help the University, they
should assimilate the man once and
let the assimilation committee take
care of the matter. If they are try-
ing to be funny, I see no humor at
all,

Ireland Assimilated

Last weekend the President-elect
of the student body was assimilated
for not wearing a coat and tie. He
had entered one of Lexington’s finer
eating establishments, late in the
evening, after driving more than
200 miles from an ODK convention
at William and Mary in Williams-
burg.

 

Mad Dash To Assimilate:
Tradition Contaminated?

Does anyone believe that many
people in the student body are go-
ing to censure Ireland for this? If
they do they are deluding them-
selves.

A Tradition or a Contest To Win?

It’s getting so some people are
comparing notes to see who is win-
ning the contest for most assimila-
tions a day. What is all this suppose
to prove?

I understand the editor of Protest,
Bill Lowry, is the one who did the
assimilating in the Ireland case. I
can’t believe he thinks Ireland or
anyone else in the College Inn late
at night, sans coat and tie, are
hurting the reputation of the Uni-
versity.

The only other thing I can see he
might be trying to show is that the
system dosen’t work and should be
changed. The fact is that the system
has been and is working effectively.

Conventional dress has been a
prime factor in furthering the good
public image Washington and Lee
now enjoys. It is a tradition which
should be and will be maintained.
But, just how far can this tradition
go?

Unwritten Exceptions to the Rule

There were and are exceptions to
the conventional dress rule. Dance
set weekends seem to be generally
agreed upon as one exception. Up
until now, nothing much had been

New Strength For Fraternities?

 

By TRACY HARRINGTON
The new IFC rush proposal has
brought forth widespread

and students alike.

The word is that the faculty and
the administration are “pleased”
with the plan, and eager to stand
behind the fraternities should they
endorse it. Fraternity men seem to
approve of the over-all proposal,
while objecting to one or a few of
its stipulations.

Exactly how will the change in
rush effect the present fraternity sit-
uation?

First of all, it will probably help
the “good” houses and hurt the
“poor” houses. Fraternities that de-
pend largely on national reputation
to attract pledges will no longer be
able to do so, and houses which are
outstanding locally but insignificant
nationally will face Rush Week much
more favorably.

Grade Importance Will Grow

Not only will freshmen be able
to see houses in a better light, but
also the fraternities will be able to
judge the potential pledges on more
than first impressions and recom-
mendations. S&U reports will be out
before pledging begins, so that the
fraternities will know ahead of time
how the freshmen are going to per-
form academically. Needless to say,
the importance of an early start at
good grades will rise.

One of the main points of con-
troversy is the condition for the
abolition of Hell or Help Week.
There seems to be a trend in a few
fraternities to want to veto the entire
program on the grounds of this one
facet of the proposal. They want a
Hell Week. This is well and and
good—but the truth of the matter is,
Hell Weeks and hazing are on their
way out. As has been said, hell
week is “a barbaric and_ senseless
anachronism that should mave been
abolished long ago.”

Molding Pledges: A Dubious Value

The dubious value of molding
pledges, and the argument that “all
good houses have a tough Hell
Week” will no longer hold water if
NO house has it. The Hill is com-
pletely against hazing, and it will be
gone soon anyway. The question is,
whether or not we shall choose to
do away with it ourselves or have
it forced upon us.

To reject what is basically a sound
and constructive program because
a few people want to see freshmen
vomit would be tragic.

The program would strengthen the
fraternities, in that it would make
for less Rush Week “mistakes” on
both sides. It would favor the fresh-
men in that they would have an op-
portunity to know more fraternities
intimately, they would be able to de-

 

vote full time to academic assim-

Constructive Move

ilation during the first six weeks of

school, and they would be provided
with a more realistic picture of
campus fraternity life minus the

glitter of Rush Week.
More Strenuous Rushing

On the other hand, the new pro-
posal would call for a much more
strenuous rushing period on the part
of the upperclassmen. The mad run
to create good impressions on the
freshmen and to attract as many of
the most desirable rushees as pos-
sible would require six weeks in-
stead of one. Social budgets would
run rampant—and houses _ that
couldn’t afffford to throw big parties
for the whole campus would be in
an uneasy position.

Occasions for dirty rushing would
arise much more often than they do
under the present system. The stip-
ulations that upperclassmen keep
away from the dormitory and the
Commons would be extremely hard
to enforce, and the definition of what
constitutes open parties and formal
rushing would have to be much
better than they are in the propo-
sal as it stands now.

Benefits Outweigh Hazards

However, when one considers both
sides of the proposal objectively, it
is easy to see that the benefits far
outweigh the hazards. This is true
for more than just the obvious rea-
sons,

We are all aware of the faculty
dissatisfaction of the social situa-
tion at Washington and Lee as re-
lated to fraternities. Up until now,
the IFC has made only feeble and
unrealistic attempts to arrive at a
compromise. Because of this, we
have witnessed several “anti-fra-
ternity” actions this year on the part
of the faculty.

These serve to point out one
thing, primarily. That is that, wheth-
er we like it or not, ultimate author-
ity is not ours. We are free to reg-
ulate ourselves only as long as we
do just that, and do it with more in
mind than just the benefit of the
social fraternity.

If we fail to compromise now, and
refuse to arrive at some sort of
constructive program which meets
with faculty approval, we might as
well kiss the fraternity system good-
bye. We cannot continue to disre-
gard the administration, because
they aren’t going to let us get away
with it any longer.

At last the IFC has met the de-
mands of the Hill. The proposal is
a sound and constructive one, which
apparently will work for the benefit
of everybody concerned. We must
now pass this' resolution, and
accept the challenge of student
government that has ben issued. If
we refuse to compromise now, we
may not be given the choice of a
compromise later.

 

In Defense
Of Beer Rallies
Dear Sir,

This letter is in defense of beer
rallies; but I'm afraid Mr. Slater, in
last Friday’s article, is one up on
me from the start because I can’t
find anything by Leo Tolstoy (or for
that matter, Kafka) that defends
beer or the attitudes conducive to
beer drinking.

With the knowledge that no lit-
erary giants back me up I'd like
to strike out on my own and ig-
nore the lack of authority which
always lends such a conclusive air to
arguments such as these.

Mr. Slater seems to deplore the
lack of support the Glee Club and
the Brass Choir received at the
hands of the students, and even re-
marks that he was “proud” to say
that he did not attend the beer rally.

According to Bearded Prophets

Why proud? Is it a matter of pride
to draw away from a student party
that is organized for fun and at-
tended in this same spirit? Does Mr.
Slater consider the students who
attended the beer rally uncouth,
and thus is he proud at separating

 

himself from the uncultured, apa-
thetic (I throw this last word in be-
cause it’s such a good one to bat
aruond,, and I’ve been told by beard-
ed prophets that it sums up all the
evils in the school) and identifying
himself with the elite that attended
this Spring Music Concert?

I don’t consider the Glee Club or
the Brass Choir as detrimental to the
University. Quite the opposite—they
are very valid organizations that
deserve recognition; however, I
can’t see the point in blasting W&L
students for taking more interest in
a beer party.

Are Beer Drinkers Degenerates?

Because a student prefers to go out
and drink with his friends and dis-
cuss whatever he damn pleases does
not mean he’s a degenerate. Many
students, myself included, look upon
beer rallies such as this last one as
excellent opportunities to drink and
talk with boys from other frater-
nities. Outside of the classroom this
is one of the few times we all have
a chance to get together.

Nor do I think most students look
at drink as their god or guide post.
There are a few, I know, but this
is mostly a matter of immaturity and
even those few soon grow out of
it.

 

‘Mainly Relax Themselves’

I think most students go out to
have a good time, They drink, talk
with their friends, raise some hell
at times, but they mainly relax
themselves.

I cannot see enjoyment as a symp-
tom of energy evily applied. Why
should this be a “sickness of atti-
tude,” Mr. Slater? Why, Mr. Slater,
do you say, “It will be a profound
relief, and no regret at all for me
when I enter a sober and saner
world; leaving behind these half-
hearted student guzzlers to stew in
their own vomit.”?

We certainly have stewed in yours
for long enough.

Respectfully,
PAUL B. CLEMENCEAU

Praise For ‘Big Clique

Dear Editor,

When Bill Lowry’s Protest came
out in favor of the University Party’s
candidates before the recent elec-
tion, many people believed conces-
sions had been made to the NFU’s
in order to get their vote.

This belief may or may not be
proven by the decision of the Uni-

 

versity party to run Steve Henry |

Letters Defend Rally, Discuss Politics

and Bill Noell for office in the forth-
coming class elections. It really
doesn’t matter.

The important thing is that the two
men have proven themselves to be
extremely capable and will do a fine
job if elected. The NFU’s can fur-
nish some good men and, although
this is too early to be speaking of
trends, I hope the University Party
has begun one by running Henry
and Noell.

Political Hypocrisy

Dear Sir,

In the Tuesday Edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, Hugh Trout wrote
a letter concerning the recent stu-
dent elections. As an Independent
Party member, he criticized the “un-
thinking” voting for the party, and
the man.

I am a University Party fresh-
man who is supposed to_ benefit
from the victory just achieved. The
“spoils system” is a great thing for
me, or so I was told by the leading
men in my party before the elec-
tion. “Seratch my back and [I'l

Sweeps Trian gular Meet

The Washington and Lee track team ran away with a
triangle meet with Elon and East Carolina here Tuesday scor-
ing 94 1/3 points. East Carolina was second with 44 1/3
points and Elon was third with 31 1/3 points. In the sixteen
events Washington and Lee took eleven first places, and with

these two victories the team brought*

it’s record to 6-1.

Skip Essex raced to a 50,0 victory
in the 440 and Jim Hickey earned
a win by burning up a hundred
yards in 9.8 seconds, his best time
this year. Hickey’s school record is
9.7 seconds, established last year.
Distance runner Mike Shank won
the half mile and placed second in
the mile. Since Mike felt the need
for more exercise, he went on to run
the two mile unofficially.

Robin Kell added 10 points to the
team’s effort by easily out-jumping
his competitors in the high jump and
in the hop, step, and jump. John
Pearson, too, was a double winner
in the high and low hurdles. Henry
Sackett scored nine points with a
first place in the broad jomp and a
second place in the hop, step, and
jump.

Other winners were Dave Munroe
in the shot-put, Dave Callaway in
the pole vault, and freshman Ken
Boiarsky in the javelin. Coach Mc-
Laughlin states that Boiarsky has
excellent potential.

Saturday the track team winds up
it’s season by going to Lynchburg
for the state meet. Everyone on the
team will attend the meet. Jim
Hickey will be defending his 100
yard dash title.

meet:

Rain Halts
Tennis Match

The Generals’ tennis team was
stopped short of a win today as the
rain interrupted their match with
Hampden-Sydney there.

When the match finally was stop-
ped, the netmen had a 2-1 lead
over their opponents. Captain John
Baker, who has been having difficul-
ty with his game this season, drop-
ped the first match to Hatcher of
Hampden-Sydney, 6-2, 6-4.

The two wins of the day were reg-
istered in the number two and three
positions. Freshman Randy Jones
and Jim DeYoung playing their usu-
al fine tennis beat their men, but
not without a certain amount of dif-
ficulty. Jones came out on top of
a three set match, 4-6 7-5, 7-5;
and DeYoung, who breezed through
the first set, 6-1, found it hard win-
ning the second, 8-6.

Both Jim Mell and Bud Hollman
had captured the first sets from
their opponents, 6-3 and 6-4 respec-
tively.

This Friday the team plays Bridge-
water on the home courts at 2:30.
Then the following Tuesday, the
Generals travel to Charlottesville
to meet their arch-rival, the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Four Errors
Give Victory
To Tigers

The Washington and Lee baseball

team suffered a 10-5 setback at Wil-!§

son Field on Tuesday at the hands!
of Hampden-Sydney.

Going into the seventh inning,’
Coach Joe Lyles’ nine was behind
5-4, but due to five hits and five
runs by H-S, assisted by four W&L

errors, the Tigers had plenty of
room to breathe with a 10-4 lead.
Mason McGowin, the _ starting

pitcher for the Generals, lasted only
3 1/3 innings, and was replaced by
Phil Sharp after giving up four
walks, four runs and four hits while
recording three strike outs.

Pitchers on Parade \%

Nearly the entire pitching staff |

made an appearance as Sharp was gee

hooked in the sixth and replaced by |§

Louie Paterno, who lasted only an
inning being replaced by Brice Gam-
ber who finished the game. Coach
Lyles was pleased with Gainber’s
performance, saying that “Brice ap-
peared more relaxed with more con-
trol than he’s shown the last few
games.”

Jim Russ and Bob Williams led the

hitting attack for the Generals with | |

two hits apiece. Russ connected for

two singles in three at bats, and|}

Williams collected a triple and a
single. Ned Hobbs and Park Gilmore
each collected a single also.
Hampden-Sydney’s eleven hit at-
tack was led by Charlie Cook who
belted out a double and two singles.
Coach Lyles said that Tuesday’s
game was an example of the tough
luck which the Generals have en-
countered throughout the season. He
added that “when the pitchers are
on the hitters aren’t, and visa versa.”
Another problem is that stolen bases
by the opposition are hurting tre-
mendously. Finally, Lyles said that
his big hitters, Russ, Hobbs, and
Monier, aren’t coming up with the
RBIs when they’re vitally needed.
The teams record now stands at
0-7, but hopes are high that the
team will get in the win column
this weekend when they play Wil-
liam and Mary on Friday and the
University of Richmond on Saturday.

Vardaman Warms-up For Match

Linkmen Defeat Colonials;
Season Record Now At 4-3

The Washington and Lee golf team
scored an impressive 614-14 victory
over George Washington on Tues-
day. The out-matched team from
George Washington arrived with
only five players, necessitating a
change in procedure.

Jack Vardaman tied in individual
play which gave George Washing-
ton their single one-half point. Gran-
tham Couth recorded a very strong
8-6 victory over his opponent and
was team medalist with a 73. {n best

Couch took a 4-3 victory.

In other matches, Ronnie Stewart
copped a 4-3 decision and Steve
Henry won an impressive 7-6 vic-
tory. Best ball won 4-3. In the final
match, Paul McBride defeated his
opponent 3-2.

The high point of the afternoon’s
play came when Stewart and Henry
drove their electric golf cart into
a ditch on the seventh hole.

The team played Bridgewater here
this afternoon in an attempt to im-

 

ball competition, Vardaman and] prove on its 4-3 season record.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Is ‘The Faculty Forcing Rush Changes On Students?

(Continued from page 1)

Dave Montgomery said, “I think
the present system has its weak-
nesses, but at this school it is the
best system you could find.” He
has, however, placed his position
with this third group.

Some students have pointed out
that W&L was rated in the top ten
small men’s colleges back when
there were fraternity combos dur-
ing dance functions and just about
any other time too, and rush was
at the beginning of the year, and
that these things are actually an
integral part of the individual per-
sonality of Washington and Lee.

‘Dirty’ Rushing

One obvious weakness of the
proposed system is that it would
leave the door open to dirty rush-
ing. The IFC committee feels, how-
ever, that the advantages of the
proposal far outweigh the chance

 

that dirty rush might be increased.

The gains from the system would
include “improved academic en-
vironment, abolition of hell week,
and an opportunity for the fresh-
man to orientate himself to the
university’s way of life.”

Also, the IFC would have all

next year to iron out problem areas
which might lead to dirty rush
situations. Some of these problem
areas are whether or not fraterni-
ty parties should be open or closed,
and what kind of dating situations
should be allowed between fresh-
men and fraternity men; what ex-|
tent casual greeting would be car-
ried out on campus, and what
should be done about contact be-
tween the freshmen and fraternity
men in unavoidable situations such
as on the athletic field and in the
gym.

A point of major concern is the

 

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

(Continued from page 2)

to deseribe the power politics of
W&L. Well, this is just so much
horse excrement. I agree with Hugh
Trout that we are flagrantly neglect-
ing our responsibilities to ourselves
and to Washington and Lee.

Super-Saturated with Honor

In a school reputed to be super-
saturated with honor-conscious
gentlemen, it is disgustingly hypo-
critical to see upperclassmen cajole,
coerce, and lie to freshmen in order
to brainwash them into blindly vot-
ing for University Party candidates.
I thought it was obvious that Tim
Ireland was the best man for presi-
dent. I thought it was equally ob-
vious that Meade Christian was the
best man for vice-president. But
it didn’t seem to make any differ-
ence. We weren’t even told that
the University Party slate was the
best; we were just told it was the
one we had to vote for, so we did.

Now that Executive Committee
elections and class elections are com-
ing up, the same thing is happen-
ing all over again. All sorts of pre-
election promises are made. Or, if

they aren’t openly stated, they are
at least hinted at. The kind of prom-
ises I mean are the loaded little
phrases like: “Well, if we are elect-
ed, that will put your house in a|
good position for committee ap-|
pointments.” Every conceivable in-|
ducement is used to bribe ever rybody |
into voting a “straight” ticket.

The white collar gentlemen
Washington and Lee who speak so
idealistically about honor and tra-
dition are just so many hypocrites
wallowing in a bed of self-satisfied
scheming. When I first came here I
saw and felt a solid and sound col-
lege atmosphere with beautiful tra-
ditions and worthwhile objectives.
Now, everything here has become a
meaningless sham. The only time
there is ever any sincerity shown is
at a keg party—and even then I
wonder if everyone is as uproar-
iously drunk and happy as_ they
pretend.

As far as I am concerned, you
can have your studs and you can
keep your cliques and party poli-
tics. I am leaving here next year
because I still believe there might
be some place that isn’t corroded
with sanctimonious hypocrites. God
help America—and the world-—if
there isn’t! A FRESHMAN

that is the case, why hasn’t it hap-

Is there any reason to believe the
