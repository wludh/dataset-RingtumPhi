New IBM ‘No. 1620’ Computer
To Be Kept Busy On Research

Undergraduate instruction and
student and faculty research will
have top priority in the workload of
Washington and Lee’s new IBM 1620
computer, according to President
Fred C. Cole.

The computer—first of its kind in
a Virginia college—was installed at
the university in late January for
teaching, research and administra-
tive functions. Work with the com-
puter will enable students to be-
come acquainted firsthand with the
techniques of computing and its ap-
plications to science, the social sci-
ences and modern management in
business and industry.

Special quarters, including new
classroom space, have been com-
pleted for the machine in the build-
ing next to the print shop.

Speedy Machine

A fully transistorized unit, the
computer—known as a 1620 Data
Processing System—will be operated
by J. Baine Fox, W&L’s supervisor
of statistical records. The unit is
capable of handling arithmetical
instructions and repetitive tasks at
rates of speed up to millionths of a
second. Detailed and time-consum-
ing computations involved in study
and research as well as administra-
tive functions will be aided by the
computer.

One university class has begun an
experimental study of the operation
of the 1620 and the philosophy of
computing. Computer applications
are being related to the class’s
study. Special courses in operation
and programming for students will
be expanded next fall. Computer
programs will be incorporated into
course work by individual profes-
sors.

Classes for Faculty

Faculty members and administra-
tive officers were introduced to the
computer during a two-week course
in theory, programming and opera-
tion. The course was taught by
Robert Smith, a systems representa-
tive of IBM. Faculty seminars on
the computer's role in a university
were conducted by Dr. James W.
Sweeney, director of the Tulane
University Computer Center.

Student research utilizing the
computer will be done under facul-

 

ty supervision. Some projects cur-
rently under the sponsorship of the
Robert E, Lee Research Fund, es-
tablished at Washington and Lee in
1960 to foster student-faculty re-
search in all departments, will be
programmed for the 1620.

The computer will be used for
such projects as the analyisis of
data being compiled from research
in th euniversity’s department of
psychology. A study of behavioral
patterns after exposure to radiation
is underway in that department.

Class problems in mechanics, elec-
tricity and optics in the department
of physics will be programmed for
the machine. Special research in the
departments of chemistry, geology,
biology, engineering, mathematics
and in the School of Commerce and
Administration also will be alloted
machine time.

Preliminary classroom instruction
for students will include work in
Fortran, a synthetic language re-
quired for writing programs for a
computer, and in SPS, a symbolic
programming system which is an
IBM code for use in preparing prob-
lems for the unit.

A program applications library
will be set up at the university’s
computer building for future ref-

 

erence. New programs written by
students and faculty members will
be catalogued for use at later dates.

“It will take us several months
to get a fully effective computer
program started here,” Fox said.
“There are a number of fundamen-
tal steps that must be taught to
those who plan to use the machine
before we can obtain maximum ef-
ficiency.

A Real Time-Saver

“We hope that with the aid of the
1620 computer, Washington and Lee
will be able to stimulate more in-
terest in research by individuals
and groups of students and faculty.
Working time on details can be cur-
tailed by using the computer, and
thus more thorough and far reach-
ing research in varied fields can
be accomplished,” he added.

In addition to instruction and re-
search, the new computer will
broaden the scope of work and in-
crease the efficiency and speed of
the university’s original IBM equip-
ment. Certain reports, registration
details and other administrative

needs will be programmed for the
1620 in an effort to supplement the
present processing and _tabulating
units.

 

 

 

 

The New Computer—Couchant

 

Mollegen Says Existentialist
Thinkers Seek Life In Death

By STEVE SMITH

Theologian Albert Molle-
gen, speaking Wednesday
night in Lee Chapel, called
man’s situation as a stranger
on earth “a most embarrass-
ing predicament.”

Mollegen, the 41st speaker
for Washington and Lee’s
Seminars in Literature, lectur-
ed on “Albert Camus: Facing
Death and the Absurd.” The
basis of modern existentialism
and of Camus’ works, said
Mollegen, is the absurdity that
man does not know what he is,
and cannot know what he shall

be.

Existentialists find meaning in life,
in the face of the absurd, by adopt-
ing heroism as the weapon against
meaninglessness. They face the fact
of death and its radical termination
and say that “all man’s being is
being toward death.” Only by real-
izing the human predicament and

 

facing it in this way can a man be
truly human and real. “Qualitative
living comes only by dying—by fac-
ing death,” and negation is in this
light an affirmation.

Man must face reality because in
the modern world he has nothing to
lean upon except his own resources
This situation is the result of the
existentialist determination that
“God is dead.” Science has killed
God, and made man self-centered
and reliant on himself instead of
God.

“A Hollow Victory”

On this Mollegen, a noted apolo-
gist for Christianity, commented, “If
God is dead, man is dead.” He found
only meaninglessness in defying God
and the universe, and the existential-
ist victory he called a hollow one.
This “victory” is merely the accep-
ance of being dead heroically.

Mollegen quoted extensively from
The Stranger by Camus in order to
establish the starting point of athe-
ism and agnosticism, as well as the
“heart of French existentialism.”

At the end of the book the main
character finds, as must the exis-
tentialist, that death is a liberation—
not because it is anything passing,

 

Davidson Students And Faculty
Vote For College’s Integration

By SHANNON JUNG
The integration of students of all races and nationalities
into the student body of Davidson College has been recom-
mended to its Board of Trustees by the College’s students and

faculty.

 

for it is complete—but because it is
a bad thing which relieves man of
a worse one.

He also used the illustration of
the mythical Sisyphus, doomed for-
ever to roll a boulder up a hill, but
never to make the crest because the
rock always rolled down again. In
spite of the fact that he never suc-
ceeds, Sisyphus is a conqueror be-
caus he accepts the fact that he
cannot succeed and continues to
struggle determinedly.

A Symptom

Two strands, said Mollegen, both
containing the problems of the 19th
Century, have resulted in existen-
tialism and Communism. Existen-
tialism is the heroic evidence of the
sickness of western civilization, as
is shown by the beatniks and angry
young men.

Communism too, it appears, will
have to go through the sickness
since it contains as does existential-
ism all problems articulated in the
arts, literature, and behavior of men.
Mollegen pointed out that beatniks
are evident today in Moscow.

The communists have already said
that God is dead, that man does not
need him because he can have utopia
on earth in the place of heaven. But
unless, sad Mollegen, they can an-
swer the question, “What is the
meaning of individual existence?”
they may be doomed.

Existentialism has raised this
question already, and attempted to
face it; but the communists, with
their utopian answers, have only
postponed it.

The theologian illustrated with the
metaphor of an equilateral triangle

(Continued on page four)

 

At the Davidson Board’s recent™*
mid-term meeting, student and fac-
ulty petitions to integrate were re-
ferred to the Trustees’ Executive
Committee.

In a student opinion poll conducted
jointly by the student government
and newspaper, 53 per cent of the
voters favored integration. Student
Council President George Trask
stated, “Recently the faculty re-
solved that no qualified student
should be denied admission because
of race or nationality. We feel that
now is the opportune moment to
express student opinion.”

A faculty poll had shown 79 per
cent of faculty members favoring in-
tegration.

Vote To Admit Congolese

Last year Davidson’s racial bar-
rier was lowered partly when their
Trustees voted to admit several
well-qualified Congolese students.
No qualified Congolese applicants
took advantage of this opportunity,
but present plans provide for at
least two Africans next term. The
student body has already raised
funds to support a Congolese.

In 1959 the Davidson Trustees
voted that it was “not in the best
interests” of Davidson to integrate.

Whereas in 1959 the Davidson
Board torpedoed integration hopes
by the vote of a special committee,
this year the subject is being studied
by a different group. President of
the Board J. McDowell Richards
said that this move is an indication
that the Trustees are not simply
seeking the same negative answer.
Richards commented that he was not
surprised that the polls favored in-
tegration; rather, he said, he was
surprised that the poll was not more
one-sided in favor of integration.

No One Surprised

President of the college D. Grier
Martin also said that he had felt
there would be a majority favoring
integration in the 1962 poll.

However ,in a 1959 poll only 46
per cent of the student body favored
mixing.

The Davidsonian, campus news-
paper, admitted disappointment that
the petitions have merely been re-
ferred away rather than acted on,
and hoped that the action would
produce new progress. Its reason for
this hope was that the Trustees
should not be “dragging their feet
at a time when Davidson should be
seizing the leadership in the
South...”

lowing officers last week: president,

Troubadours Rebuilding
Old Stage For “Othello”

The upcoming Troubadour pro-
duction of “Othello” is beginning
to take final shape. Twenty-five act-
ors and actresses are rehearsing
nightly under the supervision of
Troub director Dr. Cecil D. Jones,
preparing for the March 14 opening
night.

Apart from the acting rehearsals,
much technical work is being done.
Prof. Robert Stewart and senior
Gene Johnson are busy composing
music for the show. No attempt will
be made to approximate the musi-

 

Cravens Leads In Physics

A Washington and Lee sophomore
has been awarded a copy of the
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics
for the highest average in his first
semester of college physics.

Jere D. Cravens of Bartlesville,
Okla., was presented the book Fri-
day during his regular physics lec-
ture course by Dr. J. Thomas Ratch-
ford, of the university’s physics de-
partment. The purpose of the an-
nual award is to stimulate interest
in the sciences through student
competition. The prize is given by
the Chemial Rubber Company.

 

cal style of Shakespeare’s time, ac-
cording to Mr. Stewart. Instead, the
music will be contemporary and will
create sound effects to reinforce the
mood of the stage action.

There will be a prologue, entre-
acte, and at least five other inter-
ludes. W&L students will record the
themes under Mr. Stewart’s direc-
tion to be replayed during the per-
formance.

Special Stage Setting

The stage setting is almost com-
pleted. It is sparse and simple, de-
signed to give a “Moorish flavor and
sombre background to the tragic
action,’ said Dr. Jones. There is one
set, so each scene will be indicated
only by the presence or absence of
furniture and by what the charac-
ters themselves say.

The color of the setting has been
kept purposely neutral to display
the colorful costumes to better ad-
vantage.

The forestage has been built out
from the main stage which projects
six feet into the audience area. It
will be used for soliloquies, for two-
character scenes, and also as an ex-
tension of the mainstage when the

A Look At The South

Today we begin a new series of articles on the South and
the Sixties with an essay by Dr. Allen Ragan of the political
science department on the urbanization of the South.

 

Washington and Lee has always been a strongly Southern
school, and despite the present wide variety of geographical
origins of her present student body, she remains so. We think
that the University should concern herself with her role in a
fast-changing South. The articles in the new Friday series will
address some of the leading problems and questions posed by
this era of change. Will the South become indistinguishable
from the rest of the United States? It not, what distinctive
characteristics will she retain in the future? What sort of role
will the South play in politics and economics? In the cultural
life of the nation? These are some of the questions our contri-
butors will try to answer.

We hope the series will stimulate discussion on this sub-
ject in the University. We will comment on specific issues from
time to time in our editorials and columns as the series progres-
ses. We invite the student body to agree or differ with us and
with our distinguished guest columnists—either by letters-to-
the editor or columns of their own. We would like to see this
series become a two-way affair.

Our thanks go to Dr. Ragan for his excellent article that
is published today and to the other professors who have con-
sented to contribute their time and effort to this inquiry.

Wrestling And Swimming

Monday night’s 16-12 win over Virginia closed a highly-
successful season for the wrestling team, as they finished with
a 7-3 season record against a very tough schedule.

Coach Dick Miller deserves a pat on the back for his work
with the team this year—and in past years, for wrestling con-
tinues to be one of W&L’s strongest sports under his coaching.

Coach Norris Eastman’s swimmers also turned in an excel-
lent season against equally tough competition. It appears that
the tradition of powerful swimming teams at W&L that was
kept up under Athletic Director Cy Twombly will continue un-
der Mr. Eastman.

We think it proves that given coaches of the caliber of Mr.
Miller and Mr. Eastman, W&L teams can more than hold their
own against the best in this area.

 

Writers-In-Residence

For some reason never fully revealed to the student body,
Washington and Lee has apparently given up the concept of
“professors in residence.”

Not too many years ago, names like Katherine Anne Porter
and Arnold Toynbee were included in our faculty roster. No
longer is this the case, and we find the situation somewhat re-
grettable.

To those arguing that visiting professors are no more than
prestigious figureheads who actually add nothing to the student
intellectual community, we would like to point out the promin-
ent and highly desirable roles played by two professors in resi-
dence at neighboring Hollins College.

Both John Aldridge and William Golding are presently
employed by Hollins. They take a great pride in the life
of the college, making lectures, appearing before classes,
and generally adding to the intellectual climate of the student
body.

It is our purpose to raise only one question: why have we
abandoned what appears to be a program advantageous to our
student body?

We understand that the English novelist and critic Colin
Wilson, who appeared here during the first semester, was high-
ly enthusiastic over Washington and Lee, and expressed a de-
sire to accept a professor in residence position here.

Apparently, our faculty squelched this idea on the grounds
that Mr. Wilson was too outspoken and controversial.

Mr. Wilson, a gifted speaker and certainly a competent
artist, would have been a major asset to Washington and Lee,
adding not only prestige but also intellectual stimulation to a
university lacking in both areas.

The South In The Sixtie-—A New Series

 

Urbanization: Problems And Results

By DR. ALLEN RAGAN

Associate Professor of
Political Science

The South, like the rest of the
United States and the rest of the
world for that matter, is confront-
ed with the varied problems result-
ing from urbanization following
World War II. Of course, the South
welcomes this urbanization because
it is a consequence of an expand-
ing commercialization and indus-
tralization. As is well known, the
low per capita income and the low
standard of living which long
prevailed in the South are attribut-
ed to an unbalanced economy—a
case of too much exported raw ma-
terial and too much agriculture, a lot
of which is of the marginal type.

There has been wholesale migra-
tion of rural people into the urban
and metropolitan areas of the North,
East and far West. The same has
happened in the South and is stim-
ulated particularly by change in
southern agriculture. A  consider-
able number of farm workers have
become superfluous because of the
mechanization of farm equipment.
Agriculture has been diversified so
that fewer row crops are produc-
ed and there is far more cattle and
dairy farming. The soil bank has
taken land out of production as has
reforestation. In some areas, such as
Georgia, large paper companies have
purchased huge tracts of land and
destroyed all dwellings in them. The
decline of agriculture and the in-
crease in manufacturing is indicated
by the fact that only 17 per cent of
workers in Georgia make their liv-
ing from farming, while 25 per cent
are employed in manufacturing.
Those becoming reemployed in agri-
culture not only seek jobs outside
the South but also within it.

Space does not permit a listing

of population gains during the dec-
ade of the 1950’s in southern metro-
politan areas, but a few examples
will indicate the significance of the
growth. The Atlanta area increased
40 per cent; its million population
is a result of “a lot of planning, pro-
motion, and a remarkable civic spirit
that did not recognize obstacles
where the welfare and well-being

of the section were involved.” Hous-
ton’s increase was 54 per cent,
Memphis’ 30 per cent, Miami 89 per
cent, New Orleans 27 per cent, New-
port News 45 per cent, Orlando 124
per cent, Tampa-St.Petersburg 89
per cent, Winston-Salem 30 per
cent, Little Rock 24 per cent, Rich-
mond 25 per cent, Savannah 24 per-
cent, and Mobile 36 per cent.

Cities are faced with more or less
the same problems, and those in the
South are no exception. Perhaps

 

 

first on any list for core cities is

finances. Because of the exodus
to the suburbs of both people and
business, down-town property val-
ues have declined alarmingly. This
results in declining tax revenue
while the cost of city services has
increased sharply. It means other
things too, especially urban blight
with its accompanying problems of
law enforcement and welfare ser-
vices. Moreover, as the more ener-
getic and prosperous citizens move
to the suburbs, their places are
taken by the less capable, thus caus-
ing a deficiency in civic leadership.
There are other problems __ too:
housing, human _ relations, traffic
control, transportation, water sup-
ply, waste disposal.

The Cities’ Problem

Since urban areas in all sections
are generally under-represented in
our state legislatures and their re-
quests for assistance frequently ig-
nored, cities increasingly turn to the
national government for aid in
housing, slum clearance, urban re-
newal, hospitalization, and airport
construction. This accounts for the
lobbying of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors and the National Municipal
Association for the proposed fed-
eral department of Housing and
Urban Affairs.

Georgia supplies a classic example
of urban under-representation in
state legislatures. Georgia is becom-
ing urbanized at a fast rate. How-
ever, it is “the country boys” that
rule the state. In the lower house
the eight largest counties have three
representatives each, the next thirty
in population have two each and the
one hundred and twenty-one coun-
ties with small populations have one
each.

One might assume that, just as
the South has become more urban-
ized, it would become more liberal

in politics. But this has not been
the case, certainly not in presiden-
tial elections. With some variations
a long range curve indicates that
Republican voting strength has been
rising since 1944; in 1960, forty-two
of the South’s largest cities went
Republican. It must be noted, how-
ever, that race, religious and anti-
organized labor sentiments were
significant factors. Although it is
now quite respectable to be a Re-
publican, especially in those towns
where former Yankees now manage
important businesses, a two-party
South is not yet a reality.

The Negro Vote

No discussion of the Urban South
should omit some reference to the
growing importance of the Negro
in politics. Today the Negro problem
in the South is essentially an urban
one because it is from the cities that
Negro leadership comes in the
struggle for rights—civil and politi-
cal. Up to this time the more im-
portant gains have resulted from
court action, sit-ins, and bus strikes.
But there is impressive evidence in-
dicating that, aided by a sympa-
thetic administration in Washing-
ton, future gains will come from
concerted action to enable the Ne-
groes to register and vote. If suc-
cessful, the day may not be far dis-
tant when Negroes will hold import-
ant offices in Southern cities and
even seats in Congress.

For years now commentators have
been talking and writing about “The
New South.” Now they are telling
us that the south is at long last
“moving into the main stream of
American life.” If this be true, as
I think it is, and if the historic sec-
tionalism and parochialism of the
South is really being diluted, it is
largely a consequence of the urban-
ization of southern society.

 

 

The Twist

By STEVE HENRY

Did you know that the Twist
was “a valid manifestation of the
Age of Anxiety—an outward mani-
festation of the anguish, frustration,
and uncertainty of the 60’s, an effort
to release some of the tension which,
if suppressed and buried, could
warp and destroy”?

Neither did we until we read an
article by Washington and Lee’s own
Dr. Marshall Fishwick in the cur-
rent Saturday Review of Literature,
available in the library or at any
reputable magazine stand in the
city.

Dr. Fishwick’s article, entitled
“The Twist: Brave New Whirl” (we
tried to think of a worse pun, and
all we could come up with was
“Come on Baby, Do the Fish-wick
Me!”), is apparently intended to
explain the Twist, which really
doesn’t merit much explaining. Or
perhaps it does.

Anyway, Dr. Fishwick explains
everything, and from every possible
angle.

He notes that the Twist has
been described as “barbaric, erotic,
inhuman, and satanic,” but adds that
sex hasn’t got that much to do
with the whole business.

“[m not prepared to say if the
American girl has sacrificed romance
for sex appeal,” he writes, but he
guarantees the reader that sex had
appeal long before the Twist came
along.

What’s going on, then? Huh?

Dr. Fishwick finds the seeds for
the growth of the Twist in the turn
of the century in America, which
brought about “a quickening of the
American tempo...a change from
the protestant ethic to the social
ethic, and from individualism to
togetherness.”

From this upswing in the Ameri-
can tempo developed a new form of
music—Jazz, “an esesntially free and
uninhibited art form which ran
into a stratum of society that put
high values on properness, control,
and restraint.”

(By the way, American jazz is
popular because its rhythms are
linear or horizontal, while European
rhythms are chordal and vertical,
whatever that means. Also, jazz is
“bourbon on the rocks, sleeping on
a foam rubber mattress, a warm
summer day on the beach,” etc., etc.
Did you see “Jazz on a Summer’s
Day?” We did.)

 

Anyway, to get back to the Twist.
Every generation rebels against the

 

Dr. Fishwick’s I nterpretation

“old fogies—everybody over 26,” and
the youth of the 60’s, “anxious to
achieve its own independence and
expression, has adopted new sounds
and gyrations as its red badge of
courage.” Hence the Twist, for bet-
ter or worse.

Of course, this is overlooking the
obvious theological implications of
the dance, which certainly must be
taken into consideration. Dr. Fish-
wick quotes from several 20th cen-
tury theologians, one of whom claims
that modern dancing “is the long-
awaited symbol for the renewed
affirmation we so desperately need.”
Another says, “To Swing is to con-
firm.”

Dr. Fishwick concludes from this
that “to participate in the life of
the Man of the Sixties, we must
open ourselves to the sound of jazz,
and the sight of the Twist.”

The best part about the article
is that there’s no denunciation of
either the dance, or the generation.
Dr. Fishwick admits that he doesn’t
know what to do with the Twist,
and asks “who can draw the line be-
tween experimental and eccentric,
new and neurotic, significant and
silly?”

Well, certainly not the editors of
the Saturday Review, anyway.

Episcopal Church Presents ‘W. aiting For Godot’

 

A Promotion Pitch For Weary

By TRACY HARRINGTON

At 8 p.m. Thursday night in Rob-
ert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church, the curtain rose on a pro-
foundly unprofound play called
“Waiting for Godot.”

Conjured up by a withered little
man who looks like he has tired
blood, “Waiting for Godot” is a
product of the Theatre of the Ab-
surd, a literary movement begun in

France in the 1950’s. The plays of |
the absurd thrive on such things as |
English |

bald sopranos, _ typically
French families, deeply shallow
dialogue, and elevated shoes; in
short, they are absurd. But they are
supposed to be, because what these
throughly enlightened playwrights
are trying to say is that life is ab-
surd, and boring, and meaningless,
confusing—and their delightful bits
of nothingness are all these things.

What Samuel Beckett, author of
“Godot,” has to say is basically what
the rest of the absurd playwrights
have to say. He calls his play a
tragicomedy—-whatever that means.
The plot (using the term very loose-
ly) involves two men—tramps—who
are waiting for someone named
Godot. The tragedy of the play is
that Godot never makes the scene,
but nevertheless the two tramps

must wait until he does—of course,
he never will.

The comedy of the play and a
bit of tragedy, too, lies in the ut-
ter absurdity of the dialogue. It’s
like life. It makes no sense, it’s
drab and maddeningly repetitive.
This, in case the reader is among

the unenlightened,
roariously so.
While the two pathetic little hu-
man beings wait endlessly for the
tardy God, they are visited by a des-
picable character called Pozzo and
his bloody “menial,” Lucky. Who
they are supposed to be isn’t quite

is funny—up-

 

Christians?

clear but this helps make the story
consistently absurd. Pozzo probably
is the devil; that’s as good a guess
as any. His groaning, grunting serv-
ant (Lucky) does, says, and thinks
whatever Pozzo tells him. I’m sure
that means he is deliciously sym-
bolic of something: of what I can’t
imagine.

The play progresses—or I should
say continues—in spurts of nonsen-
sical, disconnected episodes leading
up to absolutely nothing. The cli-
max of a play, by definition, is the
“high point of the action;” the climax
{of “Waiting for Godot,” then, comes
| with the final fall of the curtain, for
thet’s the only really worthwhile
action—high or otherwise—in the
entire thing.

The production staged last night
in the Episcopal Church could prob-
ably be called a success. The actors
did what Beckett surely intended
with various roles. Fortunately, the
total effect of the play was neces-
sarily ommitted as it was presented
in the form of a staged reading.

Mrs. Lucy Fishwick, bedecked in
eyeglasses that looked like a three-
yard expanse of wrought iron grill
work, acted as narrator of the play.
In what proved to be the general
tone of the evening’s performance,

Dennis Gives Views
On We&L Athletics

(EDITOR’S NOTE—The story of Dennis Cooper, the short, graying
man who keeps our jocks clean, is an integral part of the great success
story that is Washington and Lee athletics.

To a greater extent that any other man on campus, Dennis has ob-
served our athletic program from the inside.

In order to obtain his unique viewpoint on this important aspect of
student life, the Ring-tum Phi arranged for a special interview with
Dennis, designed to provide the student body with a behind-the-scene
report on what makes W&L athletics tick.)

By LANCE TARRANCE and STEVE HENRY
Friday Sports Writers

Dennis efficiently turned off his washing machine, and cordially led
us into his spacious office, decorated in a sporting motif, with every pos-

 

sible kind of athletic equipment adorning the walls.

It was hard for us to believe that this man, whose hand is con-
stantly on the pulse of Washington and Lee athletics, had never been in-
terviewed before by a member of the campus newspaper.

When told of the possibility of his story appearing in the Ring-tum
Phi, Dennis flashed an engaging grin and said, “I’ve never read a Ring-tum
Phi in my life. One time they brought me one down with a story on the
basketball team, but I wasn’t too interested.”

We decided we wouldn’t dwell on*

anything too controversial, so we
changed the subject, hoping to get
down to matter of real importance.

Interview

The text of the interview follows,
with occasional comments of our
own thrown in to ellucidate some
of the more complicated answers:

Question: What do you think
about W&L’s undefeated football
season?

Answer: “I’ve never seen a foot-
ball game, or a basketball game,

Dennis Cooper
“...400 jocks a day”

or a lacrosse game, or whatever else
they play around here. All I see is
dirty, grimy clothes.”

He turned and pointed to great
stacks of dirty football equipment,
the remnants of last Saturday’s var-
sity-alumni game.

Wash, Wash, Wash

“Undefeated or defeated, they all
look the same to me. They’re pretty
good boys, but of course I don’t
have anything to do with recruiting.
All I do is wash, wash, wash, and
answer that bell. I don’t have
enough time to get a drink of water
or anything else.”

Question: Do any of the athletes
give you any trouble?

Answer: “Most of the time they’ve
pretty good. Every once in a while
we have a little argument, but they
just get mad and walk off. That’s
all.”

Question: Well, then, what do you
think about the new College Ath-
letic Conference?

Answer: “What conference? I
don’t know what you're talking
about.”

(We decided at this point to
change the subject, so we started
talking about the equipment on
hand.)

Socks, etc

Question: Do you have a pretty
hard time with equipment turnov-
er down here?

Answer: “You better believe it.
This place is like a grocery store, we
have to replace so much stuff. I
figure I handle about 400 dirty socks
and jocks a day. That’s a lot of
socks and jocks, vou know.”

Question: Well, what’s the favorite
item that students like to check
out?

Answer: “Basketballs, mostly, and
handballs. But people check them
out for 24 hours, and don’t return
them for two or three weeks. I let
Coach Miller take care of that kind,
though. There are a lot of things
we don’t have to worry about at all.
Take those archery bows, for in-
stance. I’ve been here four years,
and never checked them out, prob-
ably because they’ve been broken.
They probably were given to us
broken.”

Fred Walker

Question: Dennis, we see Fred
Walker in here a good bit of the
time. What part does he play in jour
job?

Answer: “Oh, Fred doesn’t come
in here except every once in a while
to throw a towel at me. That’s all.
He doesn’t have anything much to
do with my department. As for
Fred’s dog, I just don’t like mutts. I
can’t afford to feed my family, much
less a dog.”

At this point, a washing mach-
ine started roaring, and a student
began ringing the bell. We realized
that Dennis had given up one of his
valuable rest breaks for the bene-
fit of our readers.

We left him alone, arguing with
a student over a towel—a forgotten
man, devoted to keeping W&L ath-
letes clean and pure.

All three are rising seniors, and
have been mainstays of W&L’s
wrestling team this year which
posted a 7-3 record, including a win
over the University of Virginia last
Monday.

The team also elected its “most
valuable member,” and the “out-
standing freshman” award. Both
these awards will be announced at
the wrestling banquet next month.

One Starter Lost

Only Sandy Mersereau will be lost
to the wrestlers next year, and coach
Dick Miller said that the next year’s
squad could be the “best team at
W&L in ten years.”

Australian Lacrosse
Team Will Play Here

The Washington and Lee Lacrosse
team meets an All-Star Australian
Lacrosse team here on March 21.
Admission price will be one dollar,
and will go for the visiting team’s

W&L head coach Bob McHenry
said that the Aussies “have a great
team—one that'll be hard to beat.”

He also cited the Generals’ weak-
nesses in depth, and the absence of
an experienced goalie.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Slater Says Students Prepared
For Parties By New Shenandoah

By HOWARD SLATER

A golden opportunity has recent-
ly arisen for students here to get
in at the beginning of a good thing.
This is in reference to the latest
issue of Shenandoah, dedicated to
and primarily about Robert Graves,
the “up-and-coming” poet. Shenan-
doah is one of the worthwhile ac-
tivities here. Mr. Day, to use typical
Ring-tum Phiish prose, has done a
very commendable job.

In the foreword to the issue, Mr.
Day commented that “we ought to
know more about Robert Graves.”
He didn’t say why, however, so I
would like to point out how students
would benefit from knowing more
about Graves. I am speaking from a
practical point of view, of course, for
this is the reason we are at college.

Robert Graves’ reputation as a
poet is increasing at the present
time. It is more than likely that he
will soon be regarded as the fore-
most English language poet of
our time, superseding T. S. Eliot,
whose reputation is declining even
as Graves’ increases. This is precise-
ly the forecast which W. H. Auden
and G. N. Fraser made in their
articles in Shenandoah.

The Practical Consequences

Now the practical consequences of
this development are as follows:
Graves, and not Eliot, will be a more
potent topic of conversation at all
cocktail parties-to-be. Cocktail
parties and other institutions of
small talk will inevitably play an
important part in our post-graduate
existences.

Whether or not this is desirable is
a moot point; cocktail parties seem
to be here to stay, and the best must
be made of an inevitable evil. As
adults, we will still be required to
be nice chaps, swell fellows, and
sharp guys. But there will be no
combos at these parties to cover
up for empty minds and_ blank
tongues. Therefore, we will also be
required to be decent conversation-
alists.

It is obvious, then, that he who
knows what it is best to speak
about will have an advantage over
he who does not. It will be best in
the future to speak about Robert

Graves. This then is the practical
benefit to be gained from reading
Shenandoah, The magazine is a use-
ful introduction to what very prob-
ably will be an important social
tool.

It is irrelevant, of course, that the
rise of Graves will have a salutary
effect on the tone of small talk at
cocktail parties; this being so be-
cause his poetry is straight-forward
and down to earth, unlike the ob-
securities of Eliot, which are so con-
ducive to promoting the snotty psue-
doties of the more agressive and
ostentatious party-ers.

It is also irrelevant that this is
truly a fine issue of Shenandoah, and
that Graves is a really fine poet with
or without cocktail parties to cele-
brate the fact. We know what IS
relevant; so let us resolve to grab
up that magazine, for the right rea-
son, of course.

* * ae

While we're on a reviewing kick,
mention ought to be made of an-
other worthwhile literary enterprise:
namely, the writings of Washington
and Lee’s regional humorist, Thorns
Craven. It is rare when one is
gifted enough to perceive what is
pompous, hypocritical, and ridicu-
lous—and to be able to ridicule
them so that they appear funny
and not simply pathetic or ugly. This
is what is known as a lesson in
perspective. Thorns is capable of
providing this lesson, and for that
reason Res Ipsa Loquitor ought to
be required reading.

EC Votes Suggested

Assimilation Change

Late each night after hours of
studying, or equally tiring road
trips, a sweater-clad group may be
found in either of Lexington’s open
restaurants. Bleary-eyed, _ tieless,
and coatless, this coterie is guilty of
a misdemeanor; they aren’t con-
ventionally dressed. In Monday
night’s meeting, a tie vote of the
Executive Committee failed to pass
the Assimilation Committee’s sug-
gested conventional dress change
which would relax the ruling after
9:00 p.m.

The E.C. felt that such relaxed
changes would open the flood gates
to the destruction of conventional
dress. Given an inch the student
body would demand more.

Following a series of complaints,
the Assimilation Committee origin-
aly proposed that upperclassmen be
allowed the same privilege awarded
to freshmen, who are allowed non-
conventional dress in the Co-op.
This change was sought by those
upperclassmen living in dormitories
who are prohibited such casual at-
tire. Realizing the impossibility of
knowing which upperclassmen lived
in the dorms, Assimilation Commit-
tee president Steve Rutledge pro-
posed that the conventional dress
not be required after 9:00 p.m. Rut-
ledge feels that no drastic results
would follow, in fact he stated that
his job would be much easier if
certain rules were revamped.

So you still can’t grab a quick
hamburger without putting on your
tie and coat. With the EC ruling,
all those not properly attired—at
any time—will be prime targets for
an appearance before the committee.

Rutledge again voiced his objec-
tions to the commonly accepted atti-
tude that the Assimilation Commit-
tee lies in wait for violators. The
circumstances are always considered
before a recommendation, or a
warning is issued, he said.

Review Of “Waiting For Godot”

(Continued from page 2)

she monotoned her way through an
introduction and sporadic terse com-
mentaries completely irrelevant to
the play. She did an adequate job
of reading the stage directions—at
least the audience had no trouble
understanding the meaning of her
lines, which is more than can be
said for the others.

Professor John Jennings and
James Boatwright portrayed the two
tramps, Gogo and Didi, respectively.
Most of their dialogue consisted of
forgetting what they just said and
misunderstanding what they remem-
bered. This writer came to appre-
ciate Gogo, and finally to adore him.
The reason for this adoration lies in
the fact that Gogo kept wanting to
go—and I found myself praying that
he would go, take Didi with him,
and put an end to a painful exper-
ience. Both professors made an ad-
mirable attempt at creating some-
thing worthwhile and enjoyable out
of Beckett’s characters—and they
almost succeeded.

Some of Gogo’s lines really were
priceless . He said, for instance:
“This is becoming really insignifi-
cant.” I agreed wholeheartedly.
Later, he remarked, “I’m getting
bored.” Again, Gogo and I saw eye

Pozzo, loudly and diabolically in-
sinuated by Buck James. He did,
at least, make an impressive appear-
ance on the stage, and succeeded in
making Pozzo even more revolting
than Beckett intended.

Pozzo’s servant, Lucky, carried out
his role with a real display of dra-
matic abilities. He acted with finesse
and, all in all, gave the character
more than it was worth. Lucky was
played by Gregory Taylor.

The final person in the play was
Boy played by Robert Goolrick. A
charming and talented 12-year-old,
Goolrick added a refreshing touch of
normality and decency to the play.
Although his part was minor, the
boy did a lot for the production.

Directing the play was Episcopal
chaplain Wm. J. Schneider. How he
happened to choose “Waiting for
Godot” as the answer to a church
social for sophisticates is puzzling.
As art, the play is dubious; as a pro-
motion pitch for weary Christians,
it is a total failure.

As I left the scene of the Thursday
night fiasco, I admired the actors
and the director for their efforts to
give Beckett's irritating garbage a
bit of value. I’m sure they did thier
best—and, as I said before, they
almost succeeded.

The forestage will offer an un-

God was the base, and man and so-

Dr. Ross Borden, who introduced

THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GOLDER

Serer
eee:

The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such a world a heinous thing like faculty raiding —colleges en-
ticing teachers away from other colleges—is not even thinkable.

However, if the dean of one college happens—purely by
chance, mind you—to run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—just in passing, mind you

—that he is discontented with his present position, why, what’s
wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other afternoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of Gransmire
Polytech, finding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a pot of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and M!”
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, “Leander, perhaps you'd like to come over to us. I
think you'll find our shop A-OK.”

(It should be noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named
Attila.)

But I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered a
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “Thank you, but I
don’t think so.”

“And I don’t blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. “I under-
stand Kroveny has a fine little library.’

“Well, it’s not too bad,’’ says Leander. ‘We have 28 volumes
in all, including a mint copy of Nancy Drew, Girl Detective.”

“Very impressive,” says Attila. “Us now, we have 36 million
volumes, including all of Shakespeare’s first folios and the Dead
Sea Scrolls.”

“Golly whiskers,” says Leander.

“But of course,” says Attila, “you don’t want to leave
Kroveny where, I am told, working conditions are tickety-boo.”

“Oh, they’re not too bad,” says Leander. “I teach 18 hours
of English, 11 hours of optometry, 6 hours of forestry, coach the
fencing team, and walk Prexy’s cat twice a day.”

“A full, rich life,” says Attila. “At our school you’d be some-
what less active. You’d teach one class a week, limited to four A
students. As to salary, you’d start at $50,000 a year, with
retirement at full pay upon reaching age 29.”

  
    

   

 

wh fheny’s cot Youce 9 day?

“Sir,” says Leander, “your offer is most fair but you must
understand that I owe a certain loyalty to Kroveny.”

“T not only understand, I applaud,” says Attila. “But before
you make a final decision, let me tell you one thing more. We
supply Marlboro cigarettes to our faculty—all you want at all
times.”

“Gloryosky!”’ cries Leander, bounding to his feet. “You mean
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste—
Marlboro, the cigarette with better makin’s— Marlboro that
comes to you in pack or box— Marlboro that gives you such a
lot to like?”

“Yep,” says Attila, “that’s the Marlboro I mean.”

“T am yours,” cries Leander, wringing the Dean’s hand.
“Where do I sign?”

“At the quarry,” replies Attila. “Frankly, we don’t trust
paper contracts any more. We chisel them in marble.”

Stonecutters cut it in stone, woodcutters cut it in wood,
