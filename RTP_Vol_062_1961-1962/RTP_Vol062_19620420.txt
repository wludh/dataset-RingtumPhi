Bowen, Butler, Nea Named New Editors

By ROGER PAINE

In a three and one-half hour
meeting yesterday afternoon the
Publications Board elected Lanny

Butler of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Andy Nea of Phi Gamma Delta, as
editors-elect of the Tuesday and
Friday editions of the Ring-tum Phi.

Bill Bowen was elected editor of
the Southern Collegian, Ed Holmes,

S.A.E., was chosen Business Man-
ager of the Ring-tum Phi, and
Charlie Hart, Phi Psi, was selected

Business Manager of the Southern
Collegian.

Both Butler and Nea were the
Managing Editors of their respective
newspapers this year. Butler is pres-
ident of the junior class, a dorm
councilor, football letterman, and a
dean’s list student. Nea has written
for the Southern Collegian, is an of-
ficer in his fraternity, and is a mem-
ber of the IFC.

Collegian Contest

The most interesting contest of
the afternoon was for the editorship
of the Southern Collegian. George
Honts opposed Bowen for the posi-
tion, After nearly an hour of debate
in the Publications Board over these
two candidates, an impasse in the
voting was reached.

It was then necessary to suspend
the rule in the constitution of the
Board that a publications editor must
be elected by a two-thirds majority
of the Board. It was only after this
action was taken that a final deci-
sion was reached.

Bowen is Photography Editor of
both editions of the Ring-tum Phi.

 

While serving two years in the
Navy, he edited a three volume year-
book for the U.S.S. Forrestal. He
is currently teaching course in
photography for the Journalism
School. Honts is this year’s Execu-
tive Editor of the Southern Col-
legian, and was last year’s Managing
Editor of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,

Both Hart and Holmes were un-
opposed for the positions of Business
Manager. Hart has worked three

fraternity, a member of the Student
Service Society, and is in the Cotil-
lion Club.

Holmes has distinguished himself
scholastically as an Honor Roll and
Dean’s List student. He was initiat-
ed into Phi Eta Sigma his freshman
year. He has been initiated this
year into Alpha Epsilon Delta, hon-
orary pre-med fraternity. Holmes
worked last year as the Assistant to
the Business Manager of the Ring-
tum Phi, is a member of the 13 club
and is a fraternity officer.

The main bone of contention in
the Collegian election was the policy

 

of the two candidates. Bowen pro-
posed a new kind of Collegian, sug-
gesting that the reference to sex
and drinking characteristic of the
Collegian this year would be elimi-
nated or kept to a minimum. In its
place, he proposed a more sophisti-
cated humor for the magazine, mak-
ing greatest use of satire and parody.
He hopes to eliminate jokes as a
highlight of the Collegian, and con-
centrate attention on feature stories
and picture stories centered upon
local themes.

Honts defended the

style that has been in

the Collegian, planning to maintain
the general format used in past
years.
Board Suports Change

It was decided by the Board that
a change in the style of the Col-
legian was needed, and that Bowen
best offered a chance for the full-
filment of such a change

Butler and Nea have said that
they will work together as editors
of the two editions of the Ring-
tum Phi more closely than has been
done in the past. A Ring-tum Phi
Forum involving panel discussions
on pertinent points of debate will be

 

 

instituted in the coming year. Both
candidates said that they would have
an objective editorial policy, and
that they “would not be afraid to
speak out against the administra-
tion.”

A rotating group of guest column-
ists was proposed by Nea, while
Butler stated that he would publi-
cize visiting speakers more.

The newspaper elections went rel-
atively quickly in comparison to the
long-debated Collegian elections.
The Board was adjourned shortly
after 5:30, having been in session
since 2:00.

According to Dean Atwood, the

last year when the Social Func-
tions Committee first began in-
vestigating a situation that they
considered “unhealthy for the gen-
eral interest of the student body.”

This situation was the increasing

conflict between fraternity enter-
tainment and university entertain-
ment, brought on by the mediocre

quality of entertainment provided by
the dance board during the past
years, and also the decline of inter-
est in formal dances as such.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Friday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

The Faculty’s Decree

Student self-government at Washington and Lee is a tra-
dition second only to the Honor System, and at the heart of
this tradition is the fraternity system. Without inter-fraternity
rivalry for campus political posts, there would be little or no
interest in student government, and no means by which capable
leadership would be guaranteed. Except in extreme cases, the
faculty and Administration have respected the role of fraterni-
ties in the extra-curricular life of the University, and the stu-
dents have appreciated this policy. Indeed, until last Monday,
there seemed to be a tacit agreement between the faculty and
the student body that students and fraternities had a definite

“tight” to self-government.

For this reason, the faculty’s decision to forbide fraternity
entertainment during Dance Board functions came as quite a
shock, and has aroused a great deal of indignation among stu-
dents. The action in itself was rather trivial. As the University
dances have been all but eliminated, the faculty’s ruling will
affect primarily the hours in which concerts are scheduled. If
the quality of the concerts remain at this year’s level, no one
can really complain. But by stepping in on a trivial situation,
the faculty has established a precedent which can only be dis-
tasteful to the student body, and which is directly opposed to
the W&L tradition of student self-government. If the faculty
will exploit their power in a minor matter such as this, what

will they do next?

Further, the action, as we see it, was completely unjustified.
The faculty gave as its reason for the action the fact that there
is a duplication of costs to the student when fraternity enter-
tainment and Dance Board entertainment conflict. Well, we
think the faculty members have stepped out of their province
when they begin to dictate the way in which the students are to
spend money on weekend entertainment. If the faculty is so
interested in the welfare of the student’s pocketbooks, they
could begin by lowering the rates on the rooms in Baker Dorm.

What scares us and a number of students is that there seems
to be a powerful group on the faculty who try to make the
fraternities scapegoats for the University’s numerous academic
shortcomings. This is a cowardly attitude.

From what we have seen of other campuses, there seem
to be two possible results when a faculty or administration tries
to regulate student social life in detail: (1) Students do as they
please in such numbers that the rules become a farce and
hyprocrisy extends to all phases of campus life. (2) Students
who expect a degree of independence in their personal lives go

elsewhere. Neither possibility

is an attractive one for this

Back To Politics

The University Party’s slate of candidates, announced to-
day, is a strong one, particularly for the “Big Three” posi-
tions—Tim Ireland for president of the student body, Bill
Boardman for vice president, and Lanny Butler for secretary.

The UP candidates have offered a strong and progressive
platform, although we disagree with their stand on the Publi-
cations Board EC representative.

This morning, the Independent Party, in order not to be
beaten to the gun on a platform by the University Party, re-
leased a broadside containing some platform proposals. Their
platform, which seems to us remarkably devoid of any original
thought, is evidently an attempt to cover their usual reluctance
to nominate until the University Party has made the first move.

 

Is the Hill Really Anti-Fraternity?

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The latest decree of the faculty—
concerning the ban on combos dur-
ing University-sponsored dances and
concerts—fits in perfectly with a
well established anti-fraternity trend
on the Hill, a trend which, if con-
tinued, will probably lead to the
extinction of the social fraternity
at Washington and Lee—and there is
no indication that it won’t continue.

The chain of events which are
now so obviously stifling and dilut-
ing fraternity life began with the
construction of the Commons and
the requirement that all freshmen
take their meals there. Formerly,
all freshmen ate at the various
houses. But a dining hall was a
definite good. It provided an oppor-
tunity for more intra-class associa-
tions, as well as giving non-fratern-
ity men an inexpensive and con-
venient place to eat. And, although
fraternities were weakened some-
what financially and were deprived
of their primary means of “making
freshmen brothers” the good out-
weighed the bad.

Since that time, the faculty has
spoken out against pledge training
(Hell Week), first semester rush, and
and now combos during dances.

Help Week Proposed

The Help Week proposals were for
the most part constructive and
necessary. Again, although a valu-
able facet of fraternity life had been
threatened, the good outweighed the
bad. Hell Week still exists, due
largely to the fact that it has proven
the most effective means of unifying
pledge classes. It has been highly
altered, however, as a_ result of
pressure from the Hill. It won’t be
long before fraternities must seek
another means of pledge training.

Deferred Rushing
The next anti-fraternity step by

 

the faculty was, fortunately, tem-
porarily abandoned — publicly, at
least. I’m speaking of the unfortu-
nate and unnecessary petition for
deferred rush. Its proponents declar-
ed that a second semester or soph-
omore rush would relieve freshmen
of many pressures, and minimize
“mistakes” on the part of both fra-
ternities and pledges. They said,
also, that a later rush would make
for easier assimilation of the fresh-
men into the University as a whole.

Curiously enough, they ignored
the fact that deferred rushing would
close six houses. As far as mistakes
go, I think the congeniality of nearly
every house on campus shows this
up as a poor, if not contrived, ar-
gument. Speaking as a freshman, I
can say that my “assimilation into
the University as a whole” has been
much easier by close association
with upper classmen sincerely in-
terested in me as brothers. I could
not have had such an association
if I had not pledged a fraternity.
This viewpoint is, I believe, held by
the vast majority of freshmen.

There are other, more subtle signs
that indicate the trend away from
University support of the fraterni-
ties. More dorms are being con-
structed, and one professor has even
suggested that house mothers be
“hired university officials.”

Ban on Combos

Subtlety cannot be ascribed to the
ban on combos. We cannot suppose
that the faculty are so naive as not
to realize that parties are a vital part
of fraternity life. A fraternity is a
group of mutually congenial people
who like to have fun together. By
eliminating eight fraternity combo
parties a year, the faculty has taken
a giant step forward in killing the
social fraternity.

Reviewing the IFC proposal for
closed combos during University

 

functions, I can see no reason what-
soever why it wasn’t at least given
a testing period. The faculty has
made its position painfully clear:
The IFC is fine, and so is student
government—as long as University—
Hill—policy is parroted. Perhaps the
game of “student self government”
has ceased to amuse the indulging
fathers in Washington Hall, and
they’ve decided to put an end to
the whole silly thing.

Now is the time for the fraterni-
ties, the dance board, and the IFC
to see just how far the alleged
freedom of Washington and Lee ex-
tends.

Appeal to Alumni

I suggest constructive and mature
opposition to the faculty decision.
Initially, it might prove worthwhile
for fraternities to send out form let-
ters to alumni explaining the situa-
tion in detail, and asking that the
alumni express their opinions to the
administration. Whether the results
condemned or upheld the ban action,
they would at least be highly re-
vealing.

Secondly, the dance board itself
could take moves to assuage the
damage that has been done. Dances
could simply be discontinued, and
efforts made to schedule two good
concerts on the four major week-
ends, Or, dances could be set at
7:30-10:30 p.m., still allowing two
and a half or three hours for combo
parties afterwards.

Whether or not the trend towards
tearing apart the fraternity has been
intentional or not cannot be pre-
sumed here. It would seem highly
improbable, though, that the moves
taken which have been discussed in
this article are unrelated.

Why Hit Dance Sets?

Publications Board EC Representative
Called Anachronistic Abomination

By HOWARD SLATER

Of all the stupid and ludicrous
jokes which have been forced upon
us in the name of good student
government, the presence of a Pub-
lications Board representative on
the EC is the ugliest and least hum-
orous.

The men on the EC and the pri-
vate citizens who have supported
this anachronistic abomination, have
hemmed and hawed, smiled self-
consciously, and limped through de-
fense of the Publications Board
Representative. But with it all,
they’ve come up with no excuses—
only proofs of their faulty logic,
selfish motives, and undemocratic
convictions.

The argument goes that the rep-
resentative has always been a worth-
while member of the EC. Therefore,
why change him for an unknown
quantity? Moreover, he is usually
a member of the senior class, and
seniors are notorious for their ma-
turity and responsible outlook on
life. Although he is not chosen
through a democratic election, he is
chosen by a body—the Publications
Board—which may even be more
capable of picking the most suitable
men for the EC than the rest of the
students themselves!

 

Ridiculous Trash

Bull! Double Bull!! What are all
these arguments, but the same bo-
vine species! How long can such
ridiculous trash continue to pass for
true statements? No more nor less
has been said then than if it’s been
done in the past, it ought to be done
in the future.

No! Just because there’s been a
Publications Board representative in
the past isn’t good enough. Once and
for all, is this a democratic student
government we have or isn’t it? Can
we not at least attempt to maintain
a democratic spirit, Even if there are
difficulties in achieving the ideal in
its entirety?

Those who say that the Publica-
tions Board is better qualified to
choose men for the EC than the
junior class, for instance, must be
laughing up their sleeves. What they
are really saying is that the smaller
the group that determines who will
be on the EC the better. And no fool
in his right mind would seriously
claim that the more seniors on the
EC the better. If there is something
that marks off a freshman when he
comes here, it usually has been
lost by the time he is a junior. And
I'd take half the freshman class right
now to be more mature than the

 

jackasses who are still fighting to
preserve the Liberty Hall Academy.

Why Trust the Elite?

Down with the eighteenth centry!
Down with those who are opposed
through and through to democratic
precodures! There is no reason why
students have to take the word of
a chosen few elite that the men the
Publications Board is sending to
the EC are performing satisfactorily,
or even carrying out the wishes of
the student body.

There is an independent amend-
ment which will be coming up for a
vote in the coming general election.
It calls for the replacement of the
Publications Board representative to
the EC by another representative
from the junior class. In effect, it
calls for promotion of the demo-
cratic ideal and the democratic
actuality on this campus. It calls
for adherence to the belief that stu-
dent government is representative
government, and not the private do-
main of a chosen few.

This proposed amendment puts a
responsibility on every student who
has the power to vote. Can you
stand idly by and let this amend-
ment not be passed, without assum-
ing the blame for what will be a
defeat for each and every individ-
ual?

 

Bibb Highlights
Spring Concerts

By BILL ATWELL

The Meg Wells group had a dif-
ficult Friday night at Washington
and Lee. The basic reason for this
seems to be that Miss Wells and
Friends are trying to perform an
avant guarde brand of folk music
that either won’t work or isn’t per-
fected. Perhaps I am outdated but
I prefer my folk music without ex-
cursions into jazz and classical mu-
sic. There seems to be no valid rea-
son for incorporating the three. Each
is perfectly capable of standing alone
and I never have been intrigued by
newness for newness’ sake.

I must admit the group had a try-
ing time with acoustics. Doremus
Gymnasium does not lend itself
easily to the subtleties of sound
the group was trying to achieve.
They would have been a far more
effective organization in Lee Chapel
before 300 or so people.

The things I didn’t like about the
performance stem generally from the
above, so I will discuss what did
please me.

Meg Had Pitch

First of all I feel it must be said
that all the musicians were ac-
complished. Miss Wells herself had
very good pitch and knew exactly
what she was doing at all times.

The best tune the group did was
Heads or Tails (I’m still not sure if
Miss Wells had tongue-in-cheek
when she said it came from the
French Revolution). This piece was a
harmonized wordless duet with clar-
inet.

Prelude to Panic and the Dance of
Deaths created quite a bit of in-
tensity and both had good jazz
solos by Vie Holland. The shifting
of musical effects left me cold
however.

I guess the only thing left to say
is that it was a nice try and better
luck next time around.

Leon Bibb

When the performers for the
Spring Concerts were announced,
one question was asked all over
campus: “Who in the hell is Leon
Bibb?” Anyone who heard him sing
Friday night will never ask that
question again.

Bibb and his guitarist were the
best of the three groups that ap-
peared. After the Wells aggregation
it was a pleasure to hear somebody
sing—and sing Mr. Bibb did. His
deep, clear voice was amazing to
hear; for with no microphone he
filled the gym with seemingly little
effort.

Everything he did was immensely
enjoyable. Without any reservations
I will say that his version of West
Side Story’s Maria was one of the
best vocal selections to come along
in quite a while. Bibb seemed to
have great feelings for the song.

Both Good Morning Captain and
Didn’t It Rain were particularly
pleasing to the audience. On both
of these selections I noticed a very
close similarity to the Harry Bela-
fonte of Belafonte’s Mark Twain
days.

I’m sorry I didn’t catch Bibb’s ac-
companist’s name for he was truly a
sensitive, polished guitarist. Bibb’s
jokes and off-hand patter were ef-
fective and he brought his show to
a fine climax with Rocks and Gravel.
Those of you who are familiar with
Cannonball Adderly might notice

Far Eastern Sketches

 

Tokyo: A Magnificent Marriage Of The East and West

(Editor’s Note: This is the first of
two sketches of great cities of the
Far East by Peter Lee, a 1960 gradu-
ate of Washington and Lee, and
the editor of the Tuesday Edition of
The Ring-tum Phi in 1958-1959. He
has been in Korea since August 1961
with the Army and prepared these
sketches for The Ring-tum Phi on
leave in the Far East.)

By PETER LEE

TOKYO—A few yards from the
noise and dynamism of Tokyo's fi-
nancial and commercial centers is
the tranquil and ageless Imperial
Palace. The contrast is pervasive
throughout the city and the island
empire. This city is the nerve center
of one of the world’s most active,
growing economies and at once a
flamboyant and magnificent example
of the marriage of East and West.

The traditional Japanese farmer
and fisherman may be seen from a
modern fast train from Yokohama.
Their dress, their surroundings, their
techniques demonstrate dramatically
that Japan is a nation of tension.
Large segments of the population
live as their ancestors, and suffer
as their ancestors did from the ef-
fects of a feudal system. This sor-

 

did heritage of the East, though, is
succumbing to the economic equal-
ization wrought by the industrial
revolution in Japan. But Japan is
still in the process of entering the
Twentieth Century, and the tension
between the Old and New, the East
and West is present in the customs,
the politics and the culture of the
people.

The city of Tokyo astonishes a vis-
itor first of all by its sheer size.
There are not too many skyscrapers
as we know them, so one can see
great distances unimpeded by large
buildings. For mile after mile, the
city gives the impression of a great,
moving, buzzing anthill.

An Image of Movement

There are, of course, striking and
disturbing contrasts between the an-
cient, poor villager and the sauve,
intelligent Tokyo businessman. But
the contrasts are neither as numer-
ous nor as frustrating as one wit-
nesses in other areas of the Far East.
Here, while the contrasts may be
disturbing, the total image is one of
movement. In Tokyo everything is
moving, from the terrifying taxicabs
to the bumping, grinding strippers
in the burlesque houses. And while

 

the movement may be erratic, taste-
less in some areas, and hectic in
others, there is nevertheless a total
growth and movement towards the
prosperity of Western Democracies.

The Ginza, advertised by the trav-
el brouchures as Toyko’s combina-
tion of Fifth Avenue and Broadway,
deserves such boasts. It also deserves
a little of its reputation as a tourist
trap. There are dozens of fashion-
able, reputable shops, dealing in
everything from Swiss watches to
British woolens to Hong Kong silks.
But there are also dozens of guady
shops designed to capture the imag-
ination and the pocketbook—of the
tourist. It’s easy to fall, too. Tape
recorders, stereo sets, transitor ra-

| dios appear astonishingly inexpen-

sive. In many cases, they are a little
less expensive than American
brands, and of equal or even superior
quality. But there are also inexpens-
ive imitations of reputable Japanese
and American brands that appear
attractive, but won’t last long.

The shops, the stalls, the street
salesmen of the Ginza, then, are not
unlike the wonderful mixture you
can find in any prosperous, booming
metropolis. The Ginza has—like New
York—the beautiful, the fashionable,

 

the gaudy, and the cheap. It has—
like New York—it’s share of con
men—and women.

Salesmanship with Courtesy

American merchants could learn
from their Japanese counterparts.
The Japanese department stores
have mastered the American talents
of salesmanship and showmanship
for an array of goods equal to near-
ly any American market. But they
have retained something of the cour-
tesy and elegance of traditional
Japan at its best. Salesgirls, trained
to sell, are also trained to treat
customers—and tourists—with re-
respect. As you step from the esca-
lator on each floor, a lovely young
Japanese girl bows graciously and
welcomes you to that particular de-
partment. The result is enchanting.
And, I’m sure, healthy for profits,
too.

A few blocks from the Ginza, the
evidence of movement in Japan is
not quite so obvious but perhaps
more lasting »d more convincing.
Here, in the vanking and business
district, the booming Japanese econ-
omy has its home base. Here the
great industrial complexes are plan-
ned and financed. Here the ambitious
plans—which have met with suc-

 

cess—for rapid expansion of world
trade are always undergoing revi-
sion.

Japan of Industry

Japan has been for the past sixty
years the most industrialized nation
in the Far East. But the revolution
since her disastrous defeat in World
War II has channeled the results of
industrialization away from the few
great cartels and into the growing
entrepreneur and worker classes.
Certainly, some of the great cartels
are still growing profitably. But
more and more, the industrialization
of Japan is changing the lives of the
ambitious, talented young men with
ideas and the workers as well. Be-
fore World War II, Japanese heavy
industry was designed to assist the
expansion of her imperial designs.
Military hardware and basic indus-
tries were emphasized at the ex-
pense of consumer goods.

Now, it is not uncommon for the
Japanese worker to own his home,
a television set and an electric range.
Certainly, this is not yet the image
of the average Japanese worker, but
there appears to be no reason why
it won’t be in a few short years. The
problem of Communist influence in
the labor and student movements
may well be solved by the rapid

 

elimination of economic injustice
which is now underway in Japan.

Western Influence

The Western influence in Japan
has assisted greatly the techniques
of her industrial reconstruction, the
structure of her democratic politics
and the development of greater per-
sonal freedom. But there are also
evidences of Western influences—
specifically and unmistakably Amer-
ican influence—that are sometimes
disturbing and often humorous.

Baseball, rock and roll, Coca Cola,
Western movies and the Twist are
all popular in Toyko. Beerhalls have
loudspeakers blaring forth the her-
itage of American culture onto the
streets, “Come on, baby let’s do the
twist.,..” New Frontiersmen visiting
Tokyo bars may be a little disturbed
over the Jackie influence in Japanese
women’s dress when they see the
streetgirls in pillbox hats and bouf-
fant coiffeures.

And along the Ginza, a classical
Japanese opera house of modest size
has room to spare, while hundreds of
Japanese are lined up in front of
Theatre Toyko, a gigantic building,
to see, in color, cinemascope, and in
Japanese, “Gone With the Wind.”

Top-Ranked Johns

Game Scheduled|

For Tomorrow

Washington and Lee’s varsity la-
crosse team, which is winless against
only moderately tough competition,

starts the tough part of their sched-| |

ule tomorrow with a game against
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore.

The Hopkins team, subject of a
feature article in Sports Illustrated
magazine this week, is the toughest
of the tough. With a 12-8 victory
over Virginia under their belts, they
seem headed for another national
championship.

They are led by Captain Henry
Ciccarone and All-American At-
tackman Jerry Schmidt, both of
whom have already left their mark
on the W&L football team as well
as the local stickmen.

Coach Bob McHenry’s hopes for
a good showing against Hopkins are
hurt by the continued absence of
Bruce Jackson and Bob Van Rensel-
lear from the lineup with injuries.
But a fairly good performance
against Washington College last Sat-
urday has led the local partisans to
believe that the team may be pull-
ing out of their horrid spring-vaca-
tion slump.

Golfers Travel
To Williamsburg

Washington and Lee’s golf team
travels to Williamsburg Sunday for
a match against a strong William
and Mary team.

The Indians are probably the best
team the Generals will play in dual
competition this year.

William and Mary is 5-0 in match
play this year, including wins over
George Washington, VMI, and VPI, a
perennial state power in golf.

The Generals are 1-2 for the year,
having lost matches to Dartmouth
and Hampden-Sydney. The lone win
came against MIT.

With all six starters returning
from last year, W&L was expected to
field one of its finest teams in re-
cent years. But a combination of
bad weather and poor conditions on
the local course have kept the golf-
ers from getting enough practice.

Coach Cy Twombly has had his
boys on the course at least three
days this week in preparation for
the William and Mary match, and
feels that some of the boys are
finally beginning to come around.

Starters for the Generals against
W&M will probably be Jack Varda-
man, captain Grantham Couth, Will
Lee, Steve Henry, Ron Stewart, and

 

 

either Paul McBride or Warren
Hughes.

Two quick goals in the first quar-
ter of play gave the JV lacrosse team
the necessary margin for victory
over Augusta Military Academy at

Attackman Al Byrne’s first-minute
score was soon followed by Mike
Brumby’s goal giving the Baby Gen-

Three rounds of debate will be
held, beginning at three o’clock. The
second and third rounds will begin
at five and 7:30 respectively. A
banquet will be given for the de-
baters in the Evans Dining Hall.

A grandslam homerun by Rich-

to a 9-0 win over Washington and
Lee here Wednesday.

Rideout, a standout footballer for
UR, hit his grandslammer in the
third inning off starter Brice Gam-

The Spiders scored two runs in
the first, four on Rideout’s homer,
and three more in the ninth against

JV Lacrosse Team Over AMA

AMA scored its only goal in the
beginning of the second quarter,
but midfielder Syd Butler’s insur-
ance goal at the close of the half

stopped the rally and ended the
scoring.

Coach Swan singled out goalie
John Moore and defenseman Bo
Earnest and Chuck Long for their
fine defensive game as well as
the scorers.

Swan went on to say that he
thought that the team played very
well despite having only two play-
ers with any experience on _ his
twenty-man squad, and the team’s
lack of practice time created by the
bad weather and spring vacation.

Swan said “the team made up
for their lack of experience with
hustle and, consequently, we came
out on top.”

The varsity lacrosse team goes
after its first win of the season
against a very strong John Hopkins
team on Saturday, without the ser-
vices of Bob Van Rensallaer and
Bruce Jackson. Both are still recov-
ering from leg injuries.

Atwood Explains

Faculty Position

(Continued from page 1)

Dean Atwood said that this origi-
nal proposal, made last year with
the IFC’s having full knowledge of
its existence, was voted down by the
fraternity committee, which suggest-
ed that the social functions commit-
tee do extensive research on how
other schools have solved similar
problems.

Among those schools, six in num-
ber, were Amherst and Sewanee.
Dean Atwood couldn’t think of the
others, and Dr. Cook wasn’t avail-
able for information.

This year, the IFC was requested
to formulate a plan for solving the
conflict. The first idea was to elimi-
nate Friday night combos on dance
week-ends, and this was defeated
9-7 in the IFC.

The second plan was the well-
known and latest IFC proposal,
calling for closed house parties dur-
ing dance week-ends if there was
conflict.

The IFC passed this proposal and
put it into its constitution.

Last Monday, the fraternity com-
mittee met with the Social Func-
tions Committee and heard the re-
port on the investigation of other
schools. Both IFC president Bob
Doenges and dance board president
Steve Galef were present at this
meeting.

Having heard Doenges’ arguments
for the IFC plans, the Social Func-
tions Committee once again brought
up its plan for abolishing fraternity
combos during University social
functions.

This time it passed.

Dean Atwood said that the com-
mittee’s decision had “absolutely
nothing to do with a de-emphasiza-
tion of fraternities on campus.”

“T can think of only one professor
on campus who’s for the abolition
of fraternities, and I can assure you
he’s a minority of one,” he said.

He defended the Social Functions
Committee, who drew up the up-
popular proposal, saying that “the
committee has gone along with the
desires of the student body as much
as possible.”

“We've just about reached the
point where we can say, ‘If you don’t
want dances, don’t have them’.”

Texas Senator Visits W&L

To Discuss Republicanism

three, Craig Distlehorst_

The number of Texas students
at W&lL was, according to Hyatt,
another aid in getting Tower to
come. Texas students will give a
reception for the Senator while he
is on campus.

Tower was elected in a May run-
off to refill the seat vacated by
Vice President Lyndon Johnson. At
the time of his election he was the
youngest Senator in the 87th Con-
gress.

Sen. Tower was named in Febru-
ary to the six-man Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee. He
is a member of the Senate Banking
and Currency and the Labor and
Public Welfare committees, and is
one of four Senators on the Civil
War Centennial Commission.

 

takes of a year they would rather
forget, University Party politicos
are getting their campaigns off the
ground in a hurry.

Ireland, Boardman, and Butler to-
day released a nine-plank party
platform (see story, this page).

In it, they promised a more ac-
tive program of freshman assimila-
tion, the creation of new freshman
class officers, more liberal placing of
freshmen on University student
committees, better facilities for cov-
erage of EC meetings by the press,
and the improving of student-town
relations.

But the most important and unex-
pected planks on the platform have
to do with changes on the structure
and function of the Executive Com-
mittee, an organization largely con-
trolled by members of the Univer-
sity party in past years.

The new Big Three candidates
pledged support of Roy Goodwin’s
amendment to the student body con-
stitution, and also said they were
for eliminating the Publications
Board representative to the EC.

And they topped off the platform
by promising to “preserve fraternity
autonomy, this including active op-
position to the recent faculty de-
cision to eliminate fraternity enter-
tainment during University Dance
Functions ”

Opinion On Faculty Action
(Continued from page 2)

excesses were the sole objectives of
the faculty, why hit dance week-
ends? A much more important area
of concern is Hell Week. Surely
this is a problem that should be
worked out and which has more
significance than kicking the Five
Royales out of Red Square for a
few hours four times a year.

Those of us who feel the fraternity
contributes a positive good to the
development of the “whole man”
should scrutinize carefully the posi-
tion the fraternity is in. Then the
decision must be made to either
work diligently and actively to im-
prove that position or to await with
frustrated helplessness the not-so-
eventual extinction of the Greek let-
ter social fraternity at Washington
and Lee.

the resemblance between this tune
and Adderly’s Work Song. Both
were inspired by road gang songs.

I am sure many Washington and
Lee students became Leon Bibb fans
last weekend. The list is sure to
grow in the future.

Whiskey Hill Singers

Saturday the concert-goers were
greeted with a pure dose of profes-
sionalism. The Whiskeyhill Singers,
under the leadership of Dave Guard,
put on an extremely entertaining
show. The group was obviously well
rehearsed and, what’s more, they
showed real enjoyment for their
work.

The greatest asset to the group
was girl singer Judy Henske. She
has a remarkable voice complete
with growls, yells, etc. One might
be surprised to learn she was trained
in opera.

 

Well Received

The group sang a number of crowd
pleasers, including Railroad Bill and
Miss Henske’s version of Nobody
Knows You When You’re Down and
Out. The real treat of the night for
me, however, was Woody Guthrie’s
Deportees.

Some people wondered why Dave
Guard walked out on the Kingston
Trio and all that money. From the
looks of things this group will be
just as big a success. The members
won't go hungry, you can bet.

The folk music craze has been tak-
ing the country by storm in the
last few years. W&L is no exception.
The concerts were well-attended and
greatly enjoyed by the student body.
I for one hope this type of program
will continue in the future.

NOTICE
A Marine Officer Selection will be
on the W&L campus next Tuesday
to interview students.
