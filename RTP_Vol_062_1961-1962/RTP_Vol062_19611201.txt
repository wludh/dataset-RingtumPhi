Debaters Seek
Added Victory
In NY Tourney

Fresh from a recent victory in the
Virginia Debate Championships, the

Washington and Lee debate team |

faces its toughest competition thus

far this year at a New York Tour-

nament today and tomorrow.

Two sophomores and two seniors |

will represent the university in the
New York University Hall of Fame

Tournament. The four will debate |
the question, “Resolved: That labor

organizations should be under the
jurisdiction of anti-trust legisla-
ttion.”

Debating the affirmative side are
Jay Clark and Robin Wood; negative
debaters are Rosie Page and Al
Eckes. Sophomores Clark and Eckes
were outstanding members of the
team which won the Virginia title.

perience their first intercollegiatex

debate in this tournament.

Making its initial appearance in
the “Hall of Fame” tourney, W&L
will meet such national debating
powers as Holy Cross, Pitsburgh,
Dartmouth, Northwestern, and Johns
Hopkins.

William Chaffin, coach of the team,
noted that it is an honor to receive
an invitation to the meet. Only forty
invitations were issued to over a
hundred colleges which applied.

TB Association
Asks For Funds

Washington and Lee students re-
ceived letters this week requesting
contributions to the 1961 Christmas
Seal campaign of the Rockbridge-
Buena Vista Tuberculosis Associa-
tion.

The letters ask for funds, 87 per
cent of which stay in the County,
to be used for X-rays, research,
rehabilitation and patient services,
and scholarships in the health field.

Mrs. Edward R. Turner, Jr., was
chairman of the student mailing.
She was assisted by faculty wives
Mrs. Westbrook Barritt, Mrs. Leon-
ard Jarrard, Mrs. Paul Hayner, Mrs.
Leland McCloud, and Mrs. John
Wise, as well as Dr. Turner.

In 1960 W&L and VMI contributed
$303 to a total of $6,608 collected in
Rockbridge County.

Dr. G. Francis Drake of the French
department is chairman of the Coun-
ty drive.

W&L State Champion Debaters
Worked And Sweated For Success

Publie speaking ability is not the
only quality of a top debate team
and Washington and Lee’s new state
champions will vouch for that.

In order to capture the state title
last week at Bridgewater College,
William Chaffin’s debaters had to put
in some 60 man hours the week be-
fore they competed. Research, prac-
tice sessions, critiques, planning, un-
derstanding of the debate question
and rewriting are required before
the two-man teams can present the
affirmative and negative sides of an
issue.

Preparations for the recent Tau
Kappa Alpha state tournament at
which Washington and Lee out-
argued 14 teams from 10 colleges
in Virginia are only a portion of
the some 100 man hours the teams
and supporters have put in since
the university opened in mid-Sep-
tember.

The State victory for Washington
and Lee also included the capture
of five of the eight top individual
awards offered to Virginia College
debaters. Al Eckes, a sophomore from
Bradford, Pa, and sophomore Wil-
liam Noell, of Bluefield W. Va., tied
for second place individual honors
and as a negative team they were
undefeated with a 4-0 record. Rich-
ard McEnally of New Bern, N. C.,
a sophomore, coped third place on

 

Parsons Speaks At VMI

On Religion

Dr. Talcott Parsons, Chairman of
Harvard’s Dept. of Social Relations,
told an audience at VMI Tuesday
night that President Kennedy’s elec-
tion to the Presidency represents a
great step in the integration of
Protestants and non-Protestants in
America.

“The spell is broken,” Parsons
said, that a Catholic couldn’t win
and that if he did win it would be
disastrous. He stated that although
Kennedy definitely lost votes because
of his religion, it has been proven
that the once firm barrier which
excluded non-Protestants from most
phases of American public life has
been removed.

Parsons, an eminent sociologist
and author, spoke on “The Place of
Organized Religion in American So-
ciety.” His conclusions concerning
Kennedy were the climax of the
speech, which traced the develop-
ment of American religion from
Puritanism.

“We are predominantly derived
from Protestant tradition and from
certain branches of it,’ he said.
This goes back to Calvinism.” The
other major influences were Con-
gregationalism in New England and
Presbyterianism in the South.

The election of John Kennedy is
today’s culmination of a _ process
of liberalization of the Protestant
base, marking a new phase in the
integration of non-Protestant groups
into America’s pluralistic Protestant-
ism. No longer are non-Protestants

 

In America

merely tolerated, they are allowed
full participation in the life of the
nation “as a moral community.”
Parsons saw two factors which
have brought the Catholics and Jews
into more intimate and easy contact
with Protestant society: the fact that
certain members of each minority
group have served as go-betweens
with the majority. In the ease of the
Jew, the middle group was the Re-
formed Jewish church. The Irish,
who had lived close to the Protestant
English for centuries before they
came to America, were the Catholic
group who led in integration with
Protestantism. Parsons called the
Irish “very much of a bridge” of

entry for Catholicism into American |

society.

“No group can remain segregated
in the America of today,” he said.
The speaker cited residential dis-
persion as the main factor in break-
ing up concentrations of minority
groups, thus forcing further inte-
gration of different ways of life.

Parsons stated that it is more
important that Kennedy is a non-
Protestant than tht he is a Catholic.
“In some respects it would have
been as important had he been a
Jew

 

the negative side while the univer-
sity’s affirmative team members—
with a 3-1 record for the tourna-
ment—got third and fourth spots on
their side.

William Boardman, a junior from
Columbus, Ohio, edged out John
Clark, a sophomore from Birming-
ham, Ala., for third place individual
honors by one point. They make up
the Washington and Lee affirmative
team.

The national debate question for
this year—“Resolved: That labor or-
ganizations be subject to the juris-
diction of antitrust legislation”—has
required considerable research for
the W&L students. They’ve stalked
the university’s law library and gen-
eral library week after week bon-
ing up on the legal ramifications of
the question. Conferences with eco-
nomics professors and others re-
garded as experts in the field have
supplemented their research.

Bases for judging a debate team
fall into five categories including
analysis, evidence, argument, refu-
tation and delivery. Each team mem-
ber must be proficient in each of
these categories before his team can
expect a high score.

Chaffin drills his teams—he has
some 34 persons out for debate this
year as compared with 31 last ses-
sion—in practice debates and then
criticizes their presentations offer-
ing suggestions for improvement or
change.

Last week’s statewide tournament
marked the third in which a W&L
team has participated this year.
Teams from William and Mary, Uni-
versity of Richmond, VPI, Randolph-
Macon, Bridgewater and Emory and
Henry were also on hand for the
arguments.

 

Schneider Discusses Cold
War From Religious View

The Rev. Mr. William Schneider
told the International Relations Club
last night that to admit, as some
people have, that East-West nego-

| tiations cannot succeed, or that a

 

If the recent election is the sym-|
bol of America’s religious integre- |

tion, other

situations are of great |

significance also. Parsons noted the

fact that there were

nuclear war is inevitable, is to admit
that our faith in God as a dynamic
force in the universe has failed.

Mr. Schneider, the chaplain to
students at Robert E. Lee Episcopal
Church, said that such a position is
incompatible with the teachings of
the Christian Church.

Citing several Protestant and Ro-
man Catholic moral theologians, and
the opinions of several Christian
bodies, such as those passed by the
Anglican Communion in the Lam-
beth conference, Mr. Schneider
pointed out the difficulty which faces
the Christian regarding modern war-
fare.

Because of the modern weapons
of mass destruction, which could
conceivably wipe out entire popu-
lations, Father Schneider said that
the concept of the “just war” is no
longer a valid one for Christians.
For, in modern warfare, there can
be no ultimate victory; even sur-
vival after such a war is question-

able.

McThenia Calls
Charges False

By STEVE SMITH

Uneas McThenia, while praising
the positive proposals of the Protest
has made it plain that he does not
consider its criticism of his adminis-
tration to be valid.

Speaking in a Wednesday inter-
view concerning the proposals of
the Protest, McThenia said “all these
things either have already been done
or are in a process of consideration.”
But he termed “totally preposterous”
some of the radical Protest stands.

The student body president rec-
ognized Protest as representative of
an important part of the university,
and judged the publication to have
some positive accomplishments to its
credit.

The proposal to have a student
representative to the Lexington
government he noted as excellent,
stating that he plans to use it.
The new position could easily be
instituted in the Student Control
Committee.

 

 

Another recent Protest suggestion,
a call for investigation of the records
of students expelled under the Hon-
or System, was hit as an invasion of
privacy. McThenia singled out this
idea from an article on the Honor
System which he termed “not real-
istic.”

Dwelling on the Protest treatment
of Washington and Lee’s Martin
Luther King incident, McThenia ex-
pressed the opinion that the publi-
cation had gone overboard. While
he saw the necessity for the expres-
sion of opposition to the Board of
Trustees decision, he called for a
more reasonable approach in such
criticism.

Although the Protest demanded
that McThenia do more in the way
of opposing the Board from his
office, the president said that
“anything more would have been
a detriment to the University.” It
accomplishes no good for W&L “to
go out and wave your arms and
raise cain,” he said.

In another interview two weeks
ago, McThenia expressed a desire
for the editor of Protest to “read and
see” the progress made by the Execu-
tive Committee, much of which has
been made little of by the Protest.
He opined that much has been ac-
complished this year.

MeThenia announced a meeting of
an EC committee under Steve Suttle
tonight to continue the work of the
student government in reforming
its operation.

Glee Club To Sing
Messiah” Sunday

Sunday afternoon at four o'clock
the American Theater in Roanoke
will play host to a massed choir
including Washington and Lee’s Glee
Club and the Roanoke Symphony in
a rendition of selections from Han-
del‘s Messiah.

Both groups will be under the di-
rection of Mr. Gibson Morrissey,
full-time director of the Symphony,

The concert is an annual affair
in which the W&L Glee Club has
participated for the past few sea-
sons. The program will include sev-
eral solos plus such well-known
numbers as “Unto Us a Child Is
Born” and the “Hallelujah Chorus”
by the entire group.

The Glee Club has been rehears-
ing for this concert since the latter
part of October, including two re-
hearsals in Roanoke with Symphony.

The Glee Club has three concerts
slated between now and the Christ-
mas holidays in addition to the one
on Sunday. The first will be Tuesday,
December 5, at 8 p.m. in the Lex-
ington Presbyterian Church in joint
concert with the Sullins Choir and
the Brass Choir. The Glee Club
will return Sullins’ visit the follow-
ing Tuesday with a concert at Bris-
tol.

The final concert before the holi-
days will be a Candlelight Service
on Thursday, December 14, in the
R. E. Lee Church at 10 p.m.

 

New Chess Club Begins
Tournament Schedule

The recently formed W&L Chess
Club has begun its intra-club tour-
nament schedule by sponsoring both
two section tournaments. Competi-
tion in the “A” section will determ-
ine the players on W&L’s Chess
Team which will engage the faculty
in a match later this semester. This
match would pit the faculty’s best
seven players against the seven top
men in the Club “A” tournament, in
which Ronnie Moore and Lon Atkins
are leading having won all of their
games to date. Close behind, how-
ever, are Bill Gray, Franco de Bat-
taglia, Chris Conyers and Jack Mar-
tin.

Dr. Wright To
Speak Thursday

Dr. Louis Booker Wright, Direc-
tor of the Folger Shakespeare Li-
brary since 1948, will speak here
next Thursday on “Shakespeare for
Every Man.”

Dr. Wright will appear in Lee
Chapel under the sponsorship of
the English Department.

An American historian as well as
Shakespearian scholar, Dr. Wright
has visited Washington and Lee a
number of times, several years ago
to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa lec-
ture. He received his Ph. D. degree
in 1926 at North Carolina.

Dr. Wright has a varied back-
ground, serving in the U.S. Army
near the end of World War I and
becoming, shortly thereafter, a
newspaper correspondent and edi-
tor. He has served on the facul-
ties of several universities, includ-
ing UCLA, California Institute of
Techonology, Princeton, Amherst,
Rale and Pomona College.

An authority on the South, Dr.
Write has published a number of
books, including Religion and Em-
pire (1942), and The Cultural Life
of the American Colonies (1957). In
addition, he edited The Secret Diary
of William Byrd of Westover, 1702-
1712 in 1941 and The Folger Library
General Reader’s Shakespeare in
1957.

 

 

by the recently chosen Dance
Board Committee is significant for
several reasons. The dress of “High
Society” will simulate that of a
Banquet of State or an Inaugural
Ball and hence will blend well with
the atmosphere of columns and
chandeliers in the Dining Hall.

Costume Prices Reduced

The costumes for the ball will con-
sist of white tie, tails, and other
formal accoutrements for the men
and formal dresses for the ladies.
Therefore, a reduction in the cost of
the costumes has been made pos-
sible, since only the male dress will
be rented; it is assumed that the
girls will provide their own formal
evening gowns.

Frank Young, Dance Board vice-
president, has made arrangements
with the Oak Hall Costume Com-
pany in Roanoke for the provision
of male attire. The costumes will
be made available to students on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of next week. Representatives of
the Oak Hall Company will be in
the Student Union on these days to
rent the costumes.

The shift of the setting for the
Fancy Dress Ball from the Doremus
Gymnasium to the Commons is sig-
nificant, but experimental. The Dance
Board in making this change is ful-
filling campaign promises made dur-
ing last year’s elections and is re-
sponding to popular demand.

Extra Expense Involved

The use of the Dining Hall will
involve extra expense and consid-
erable trouble to the Dance Board,
but the decision was made for the
benefit of the students and the pos-
sible enhancement of the unique
reputation of Fancy Dress Ball in
collegiate circles.

The announcement that the Com-
mons would be available was made
following Mr. Mattingly’s statement
of a decision of the faculty and ad-
ministration to that effect.

Galef also said that the Dance
Board will spend more money this
year on Fancy Dress entertainment
than has been spent in the past in
an effort to “make this the best
Dance Weekend in our history.”

Ellington Contracted

It has already been announced that
Duke Ellington has been contracted
to play for the formal ball on the
Friday night after exams, February
2. The entertainment for the con-
cert and dance to be held on Satur-
day the third has already been de-
cided upon and approved by the
student Dance Board Committee;
the public announcement of this in-
formation will be made next week.

Fancy Dress president Bill Ide
and his vice-presidents are already
at work on publicity, stunts, gim-
micks, and decorations to stimulate
student and inter-collegiate inter-
est in the Weekend. Dance Board
members will visit the various fra-
ternity houses during the early part
of next week to encourage students
to participate fully in this annual
social event and to rent their cos-
tumes early.

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Control Committee On Its Way

Steve Suttle’s report today that the Executive Committee
has received a large number of applications for the student
disciplinary committee indicates that our first reports of a
lack of student interest in the committtee were wrong. We’ve
had a look at the list of men who applied before Tuesday and
are sure that from these applicants alone that an able committee

could be chosen.

Applications for the committee don’t close until Monday,
so anyone interested and qualified to serve on the committee
can still apply for consideration by the EC.

The EC has done an excellent job in getting the student dis-
ciplinary committee through the faculty and administration,
and in explaining it to the student body. But the real work
will be passed on to the new members. They will be largely re-
sponsible for defining the aims and goals of student-adminis-

tered discipline.

They will need a great deal of support from the student
body and will need further to maintain particularly close con-
tact with their fellow students in the first year of the new com-

mittee’s work.

The Ring-tum Phi plans to keep a close watch on their ac-
tivities, and we hope the student body will make their own
views felt through Letters to the Editor.

Not Just An Ethical Question

A great many people, like Dr. Hodges in the interview we
print today, feel that segregation is morally wrong. They have
a right to that opinion. We likewise think that the people who
oppose them have a right to their opinion, and will thereby
refrain from making a judgment here of the Christian ethics

involved.

We do think, however, that the people who are demanding
an immediate forced integration in the schools, bus stations
and restaurants are not justified in their efforts by this disputed
ethical judgment. The great tragedy of the Civil War should
have been demonstration enough of the folly of trying to en-
force a moral precept without regard to the social, economic,
and legal framework of the problem. Even so ardent a group of
integrationists as the editors of Time magazine have been com-
pelled to recognize in the exodus of white pupils from the in-
tegrated public schools of Washington, D.C., that integration
in law and integration in fact are two different things.

If the Negro race is equal in ability to the white, and this is
more an article of faith among sociologists than a scientific
law, it can be best proven by a massive drive by the Negroes
themselves to positions of trust and responsibility. Many
Negroes have done just this. We think that genuine integration
will only take place when the dominant white race is compelled
to recognize by a record of solid accomplishment that the
Negro is indeed equal. This will not happen in one generation,
or even two. An attempt to force the integration too fast can
only create more new differences and hatreds between the races.
Race relations are worse than they were 15 years ago. They

should get no worse.

The Renaissance Of Debate

Washington and Lee is fortunate to have a man with the
ability and interests of Mr. William Chaffin as advisor to the
intercollegiate debate team and the Forensic Union.

Debate wasn’t very important here before he took over last
year. Now we have met with considerable success in intercol-
legiate debate and debating has suddenly become a popular and
well-respected extracurricular activity. Debating activities have
given a healthy intellectual stimulus to the campus.

We think it proves that what we most need here are stimu-

lating and dedicated men on

the faculty. The interest and

ability on the part of students to do good work in most fields
here needs only to be tapped as Mr. Chaffin has done with his

debaters.

 

Behind The News...

The Liberty Hall Society is toying
with the feasibility of publishing a
pamphlet which would _ discuss
frankly the merits and demerits of
all undergraduate courses. It is be-
lieved that such a pamphlet would
help students pick their schedules,
and encourage professors to take a
new look at their courses.

oo * *

After all is said and done, there
were two sides to the Great Martin
Luther King Debate. Southwestern
at Memphis recently invited a prom-
inent Negro lawyer to speak, and
within twenty-four hours an irate
alumnus had changed his will, strik-
ing out a clause which contained a
grant to Southwestern of more than
$100,000. And a rumor has it that
Randolph-Macon lost at least
$600,000 as a result of last year’s sit-
in episodes.

The trustees might very well have
had these incidents in mind when
they made their decision.

In the wind for next fall: a small
college football conference, com-

 

posed of teams whose athletic poli-
cies resemble the successful Wash-
ington and Lee system. Possible
members include W&L, Sewanee,
Centre, Southwestern at Memphis,
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
Franklin and Marshall, and Johns
Hopkins.
+ * cm

More than one professor has been
heard to complain about the fact
that Washington and Lee seems to
stifle creative ability in the faculty.
The feeling is, apparently, that fac-
ulty members do not have the time,
nor the encouragement, to pursue
their own interests. Lack of “intel-
lectual atmosphere” is also a factor,
they say.

Terry Fohs will be a candidate for
Little All-American honors again
this year. Publicity director Frank
Parsons has worked up a pamphlet,
complete with pictures, which is
intended to remind the proper au-
thorities of Fohs’ on-field and off-
field accomplishments.

All who have seen Fohs play agree

What’s Wrong
With Basketball

Program Here?

By STEVE HENRY

Nothing warms the heart of an
athlete so much as does the sight
of a sizeable crowd turning out
for a game in which he is partici-
pating.

Like, for example, the crowd that
showed up for Monday’s basketball
scrimmage between the W&L var-
sity and freshmen.

Razor-shap, alert, and in perfect
shape after Thanksgiving vacation,
the point-a-minute varsity scored
in every period to post a 25-point
win over the frosh, who made a real
battle out of the game after scoring
their first field goal midway through
the first half.

Nobody in the crowd could quite
figure out if the varsity defense was
that good, or if the freshman of-
fense was that bad. It didn’t really
seem to matter too much to any-
body, because the crowd didn’t have
much to say about the whole per-
formance.

Civilized Crowds

Warnings were given at the be-
ginning of the game that this year
W&L rooters were expected to carry
on the gentlemanly tradition at
basketball games, and to forget the
old days when rabid crowds and
the horrid facilities of Doremus
Gymnasium gave our squads the big-
gest homecourt advantage in college
basketball.

Whoever dreamed up the idea
about our crowds getting civilized
must have forgotten that in the last
two years, W&L has won only one
game on the road, while winning al-
most every game at home.

Something must make the differ-
ence, and we strongly feel that
the big factor (always disallowing
the gym itself) is the way in which
our crowds conduct themselves, with
much cheering, hooting, and jeering.

To ask us to keep quiet and to
be good sports at basketball games
is to invite suicide for the W&L
basketball team’s season record. Ask
the boys from Uva. if you don’t
believe what we’re saying. They have
felt the wrath of a Washington and
Lee crowd.

Basic Problems

While we're on the subject of
basketball, it might be a good time
to bring out a few other things that
occurred to us during Monday’s
scrimmage.

1. W&L has only one good basket-
ball player this year, and no one
needs to be reminded who he is.
Without him, we would be hurting
far worse than the average mind
can comprehend.

2. We have a considerable num-
ber of boys who could be good
basketball players, and will be good
before the season is over, provided
they get good coaching. So far as
we can see it, this is Bob McHenry’s
biggest challenge—to get his boys to
produce.

We believe just about everybody
knows and appreciates his problems.
He has no height and not much ex-
perience. Now that we know it, we
don’t need to hear any more about
it.

3. The best pivot man in school
is playing for the freshmen, and not
for the varsity, where his talents
are sorely needed. The explanation
for this phenomenon is not clear.
Someone told us that the boy is not
in good enough health to play varsi-
ty ball. What in God’s name is he
doing playing freshman ball, then?
This strikes us as being highly para-
doxical, but in a strange way typical.

Junior Varsity Needed

4. The idea of our putting a fresh-
man team on the court, while the
best freshmen are playing varsity, is
somewhat ridiculous, _ especially
when you take into consideration
that most of the members of the
freshman team are refugees from
PE and will never go on to play
varsity basketball in the future. Why
not a J-V team, composed of upper-
classmen and freshmen, thus pro-
viding experience for those inex-
perienced players we're always
hearing about? This would seem
quite logical. Many a senior who
could be playing good ball for the
Generals this year is doing his shoot-
ing for intra-mural teams now. An
adequate J-V program could not
hurt, could only help, General
basketball fortunes.

McHenry openly admits that he’ll
be happy with a .500 season this year.
We personally will be quite sur-
prised and pleased if he manages to
accomplish even this much.

This is all pretty sad when you
remember that not too many years
ago W&L had an authentic All-
American and was playing big-
time college basketball with big-
time basketball players.

Not that we're advocating a re-

An Interview With Dr. Hodges ...

 

Segregation Stands Condemned ©
Judged By Christian Standards

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“There is no respected theologian
in this country who dosen’t agree
that segregation by races in princi-
ple violates Christian ethics.”

Dr. Louis Hodges, Washington and
Lee religion professor, called segre-
gation “a form of limitation of free-
dom based on the denial of equal
opportunity for all men.”

According to him, the Christian
doctrine of God is that God “creates
all men of equal worth.”

“Men are not equal intellectually,
nor are they equal in many other
ways—but they are of equal worth.”

Dr. Hodges expounded on the
Christian attitudes toward “equality
of worth,” as he called it.

He said that “it is just as worth-
ful in the eyes of God for an ignor-
ant man to develop his potential as
it is for an intelligent man to de-
velop his.

“Segregation denies this oppor-
tunity for equal development of po-
tential.”

Stereotype Problem

How does segregation do this?

“When the Negro or any member
of a group is unfavorably stereo-
typed, he doesn’t have a chance to
prove himself. The scales are weight-
ed against him.”

Dr. Hodges described how this
stereotyping occurs.

“One observes that many Negroes
have undesirable characteristics. We

The Virginia
(Review of “Gentlemen of Vir-

ginia, by Marshall W. Fishwick.
Dodd, Meade & Company. $5.00.)

We at Washington and Lee hear
a good deal about the mystical no-
tion of the gentleman and now one
of our professors has written a book
dealing with the subject.

Dr. Marshall Fishwick’s recent edi-
tion to his series of Virginia studies,
entitled Gentlemen of Virginia, is
composed of a series of biographical
sketches of exemplary Virginia
gentlemen interspersed with chapters
given over to various aspects of
Virginia culture reflecting the
gentlemanly tradition.

This volume will be found by the
student to be as pleasant, and at
times as inebriative, as the local
beverage of a similar name. Raleigh,
Smith, Berkeley, and William Byrd,
II, are the pre-Revolutionary men
we meet.

Raleigh, who incidentally never
came to Virginia, is discussed be-
cause, given the luck to meet the
Queen at a “plashy place” and hav-
ing a new coat to lay at her feet,
he “caught, in one symbolic act,
what the generation stood for and
died for.”

Similarly, Smith, who by most ac-
counts was a rogue and scoundrel,
becomes the man of the hour who
saved Jamestown and thus took a
place in “an aristocracy of action.”

Berkerley is shown by Dr. Fish-
wick to have become an unjustifiable
goat of the historians. Fishwick’s
account, which is quite plausible,
portrays him as a Royal governor
who had both the good of the col-
ony and a strong concept of Anglo-
Saxon liberty in his heart during
the suppression of Bacon’s Rebel-
lion.

Treatment of Byrd Poor

The author’s treatment of William
Byrd, II, suffers from a lack of that
feeling of intimacy with the subject
matter which he developed so well
in his accounts of Smith and Ber-
keley. Perhaps our good professor
felt constrained to overlook the
racier side of Byrd’s life in an effort
to maintain the respectability of the
book in the eyes of those fine old
ladies to whom Virginia tradition
means so much.

At any rate the more worldly

tend to make from this the unwar-
ranted conclusion that all Negroes
have these characteristics.

“On this basis, when one encount-
ers an individual Negro, he tends
to deal with that Negro as if he
has these undesirable characteris-
tics.”

As far as the Negro in the South
is concerned, Hodges said “it is true”
that “on the whole, the Negro is
inferior to the white man in terms
of health standards, education, and
moral standards, taken in general.”

He added, however, that “it would
not be true to say that any given
Negro is inferior to any given white
person in these respects.”

“Some Negroes,” he said, “are
superior to some whites in these
areas.”

Dr. Hodges could not see a moral
violation in segregation by superiori-
ty, as long as all were given full
opportunity to develop their poten-
tial. “But racial segregation does
not separate superior from infer-
ior.”

The Role of the Church

As for the Christian Church as a
whole, Dr. Hodges described its
goal regarding desegration of the
races as “the same as that of the
NAACP.”

Turning from the general ques-
tion of Christian ethics versus the
racial problem in the South, Dr.
Hodges spoke of the dilemma as it
affects Washington and Lee.

 

“In principle segregation is con-
trary to the Christian ethic,” he said.

“If we at Washington and Lee are
to seek to inculcate the Christian
ideal, we must deal with the ques-
tion of race relations and Christian
ethics.”

He said that we are dealing with
the problem. “We are discussing it
right now on campus.”

What About W&L?

In response to a question about
the all-white admissions policy of
W&L, Dr. Hodges said the univer-
sity “is not necessarily run accord-
ing to Christian ethics in regard to
admission policies—it does not make
this claim.”

Concluding his comments, Dr.
Hodges talked about segregation and
the future.

He said segregation is a “permis-
sable” step between slavery and total
integration. “The Negro has been
raised somewhat under segregation.”

“Segregation,” he said, “is defi-
nitely out as far as law is concerned.

“But prejudice is not out. Hence
there will be subtle extra-legal
forms of segregation as long as there
is racial prejudice.”

What does this mean, then, to
Christians?

“It means that the objective of
the Christian Church is to work in
what every ways it can to remove
these prejudices.”

Gentleman: Past & Present

undergraduate is admonished to go
directly to Byrd’s secret diaries lest
he get the wrong impression of that
exuberant rake.

The sketches of George Mason,
George Washington, and Thomas
Jefferson reveal that these men held
ideals in common which, apparently
assisted in producing the marvelous
ideas enshrined in our form of gov-
ernment.

Fishwick, with his characteristic
wit, cites the story of Calvin Cool-
idge who, during the cynical period
of debunking of these heroes in the
Twenties, was told of charges that
Washington was vain, carnal, and
undemocratic. Silent Cal walked
over to the window, looked out, and
said “Washington’s monument is
still there.”

Fishwick’s Scheme Exposed

Now the theme of Fishwick’s
book becomes apparent. It is: a long

 

time ago Virginia had some great
men, they did some great things.
They also had a gentlemanly ideal.
Over the years Virginia’s greatness
and her men have declined.

Why? Because the gentlemanly
ideal is still professed, yet it has
lost its original validity. Only the
surface, superficial aspects of the
gentleman are given consideration
while the underlying values of the
gentlemanly ideal have been forgot-
ten.

Fishwick demonstrates with a
chapter on the unsatisfactory life
of John Randolph of Roanoke. Later
he approaches heresy in suggesting
that Lee, a great good man, became
in his defeat a tragic symbol of and
for the South.

Those of us who enjoy the Fish-
wick lecture, which often smashes
idols the average student accepts
unquestioningly, will also relish the

CAGERS TO FACE IMPROVED WAHOOS

Season Opens With Generals
Lacking Height, Experience

Washington and Lee will get a chance to prove that height
does not necessarily win basketball games in its season opener

at Virginia tonight.

The Five-Star Generals’ starting line-up boasts no one

taller than captain Rodger “Bip’*

Fauber of Lynchburg, at a towering
6-2. On the other hand, Virginia’s
first five averages 6-2 with sopho-
more center Richard Katstra top-
ping the Cavaliers at 6-9.

Joining Fauber in the W&L start-
ing line-up tonight are Bill Ide, a
6-1 guard who was switched to for-
ward this year; Bill Smith, 6-2
center; and Tom and Jon Supak, a
pair of 6-1 guards who transferred
to W&L this year from William and
Mary.

Displaying a mixture of phenom-
enal shooting, shooting, hustle and
desire, the Generals upset a taller
Virginia squad, 78-68, here last year;
but this year the road to victory
will be even harder for the “cru-
sading midgets.”

“We figure we'll hit 50 per cent
of our shots from the floor to
whip them,” said General coach
Bob McHenry.

“We'll have to play a real scrappy
defense, and make them play slop-
pily. We'll also have to work ex-
tremely hard on offense to get the
good percentage shots,” he said.

Fauber and Ide are the only re-
turning lettermen from last year’s
squad which posted a 7-11 mark.
Fauber had a 14.2 scoring average
and a 168 rebound average last
year. Ide, who came into his own
late in the season, produced a 5.0
scoring average.

Fauber certainly remembers the
Generals’ upset of Virginia last
year in which he scored 26 points
and grabbed 24 rebounds, but he is
also very aware of the type of
game W&L will have to play in
order to win: We’ll have to give it
everything we’ve got, to beat Vir-
ginia again this year,’ the captain
emphasized.

Virginia’s two returning starters—
guard Tony Laquitano and forward
Gene Engel—also should well re-
member their harsh upset at the
Generals’ hands.

“Coach McCann won't need to
say a word to his squad to get them
up for us,’ McHenry said. “I’m
sure they recall last year well
enough.”

But McHenry quickly added:

“We've been pointing for them
for all six weeks of pre-season prac-
tice. We really want to beat them
again.”

The Generals’ biggest worry will
come from Virginia’s frontline sky-
scrapers—6-9 Katstra, 6-4 Engel and
6-4 Hunter Conner. These three have
a combined edge of 12 inches over
W&L’s front-liners. At guard the
Generals have a slight height ad-
vantage.

 

 

Local Hunting
Seasons Open
Until January

A game official at the Rockbridge
County Courthouse said that 4335
deer hunting stamps have been sold
in the county this year. This is an
increase of 600 over last year’s sales.
The sale of all types of hunting per-
mits and licenses has increased this
year.

The deer season for Rockbridge
County was November 20-25. A
hunter could shoot one deer a sea-
son, for the first three days of either
sex, and for the last three days
bucks only.

There is a continuous open season
on hunting squirrels and hunting
foxes with dogs. Fox hunting with
guns is limited to October 2-January
$1.

The bag limit on squirrels is six
a day and 75 a season. There is no
bag limit on foxes.

Rabbits, grouse, and quail may be
hunted November 20-January 5.
Pheasant hunting is prohibited out-
side of licensed shooting preserves.
Elk hunting is prohibited.

More complete information and
the necessary licenses may be ob-
tained at the Rockbridge County
Courthouse.

 

Frosh Basketballers
Open Season Saturday

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team opens a 13-game

in Doremus
Fork Union.

Coach Joe Lyles’ squad, which
dropped a practice scrimmage to the
W&L varsity by 25 points last Mon-
day, is counting heavily on the ser-
vices of 6’ 3” Jerry Kowalski, who
was outstanding against the varsity.

Kowalski, the younger brother of
former Washington and Lee starting
varsity forward Ken Kowalski, plays
pivot for the baby Generals.

Lyles also praised forward Dick
Livingston for his performance
against the varsity.

Generals Place Five Men
Among Top State Scorers

Five members of Washington and
Lee’s undefeated football team were
among top ten scorers in Virginia
football for the 1961 season.

Junior halfback Charlie Gummey
and senior Doug Martin led the
Generals with 54 points apiece, good
enough for a second place showing
on the overall state scoreboard.

Richmond’s Earl Stoudt, who clos-
ed out his college career with a 26
point showing against William and
Mary on Thanksgiving Day, over-
took both Gummey and Martin for
first place, ending up with a total
of 67 points for the year.

FB Captains

Tommy Keesee, Charlie Gummey,
and Bob Payne have been named
co-captains for the 1962 Washing-
ton and Lee football team, it was
announced yesterday.

All three are rising seniors.

Keesee, a 185-pound fullback from
Memphis, Tenn., moved into the first
string General line-up for the first
time this year. Not including sta-
tistics for the Washington game, he
picked up 251 yards in 64 carires for
a 3.9 yard rushing average.

For the season, he scored 28
points, good enough to place sixth
in Virginia college scoring.

A 70-yard run against Carnegie
Tech during his sophomore year
gave W&L a 6-0 win, and earned
Keesee back-of-the-week honors
from the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

**HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY”

I have asked the makers of Marlboro—an enterprising and
aggressive group of men; yet at the same time warm and lovable;
though not without acumen, perspicacity, and drive; which does
not, however, mask their essential great-heartedness; a quality
evident to all who have ever enjoyed the beneficence of their
wares; I refer, of course, to Marlboro Cigarettes, a smoke
fashioned with such loving care and tipped with such an easy-
drawing filter that these old eyes grow misty when I think upon
it—I have asked, I say, the makers of Marlhoro—that aggregate
of shrewd but kindly tobacconists, that cluster of hearty souls
bound together by the profit motive and an unflagging deter-
mination to provide a cigarette forever flavorful and eternally
pleasing—I have asked, I say, the makers of Marlboro whether
I might use today’s column to take up the controversial question:
Should a coed share expenses on a date?

“Yes,” said the makers simply. We all shook hands then and
squeezed each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles,
and if our eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame us?

To the topic then: Should a coed share expenses on a date?
I think I can best answer the question by citing the following
typical case:

Poseidon Nebenzal, a student at Oklahoma A and M, major-
ing in hides and tallow, fell wildly in love with Mary Ellen
Flange, a flax weevil major at the same school. His love, he had

 

On folsh eer ye out Ca bebe? °
reason to believe from Mary Ellen’s sidelong glances and

maidenly blushes, was not entirely unrequited, and by and by he
mustered up enough courage to ask her the all-important

question: ‘Will you wear my 4-H pin?”

“Yes,” she said simply. They shook hands then and squeezed
each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles, and if their
eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame them?

For a time things went swimmingly. Then a cloud appeared.
Mary Ellen, it seems, was a rich girl and accustomed to costly
pleasures. Poseidon was bone-poor and he quickly ran out of
money. Unable to take Mary Ellen to the posh places she
fancied and too proud to tell her the reason, he turned surly and
full of melancholy. Soon their romance, so promising at the
beginning, was headed for a breakup. But at the last moment,
Poseidon managed to blurt out the truth.

“Oh, beloved agrarian!’ cried Mary Ellen, grappling him
close. “Oh, proud husbandman! Oh, foolish reaper! Why have
you not told me before? I have plenty of money, and I will
contribute according to my ability.”

Poseidon, of course, protested, but she finally persuaded him
of the wisdom of her course. From then on they split all expenses
according to their incomes. Rather than embarrass Poseidon by
handing him money in public, a joint bank account was set up
to allow him to write checks. Into this account each week they

faithfully deposited their respective allowances—:
Poseidon; $2300 from Mary Ellen.
And it worked fine! They were happy

what’s more, when they graduated they had a nice little nest
egg—eight million dollars—with which to furnish a lovely

will only adopt a healthy, sensible attitude toward money.

at Kennedy’s inauguration, and that
in the armed services chaplains of
all faiths are accorded equal status.
Constitution Clinched Secularization

The United States’ Constitution
was named by the speaker as a
major step in the development of
America’s organized religion as well
as a crucial break with tradition in
the separation of church and state.
This “secularization” of religion was
followed by Parsons to the present
day.

He defined secularization as a pro-
cess of differentiation by which re-
ligion becomes a progressively smal-
ler part of the whole life. This
process need not be anti-religious in
the least .

The movement, for Christianity,
began under the leadership of St.
Paul, when the early Christian

church broke with the Jewish com-
munity. Christianity went through
stages to become the official religion
of the Roman Empire; then it had
to begin anew after the breakup of
the Western empire.

The differentiation relevant to
Parsons’ topic began in the Middle
Ages. For centuries the state gov-
ernment was controlled by the
church; later the state became in-
dependent but remained fully Chris-

tian in character. Finally, America
is completely tolerant of all religions,
although the American society re-
mains primarily a Theistic one.

Parsons expressed the opinion that
although religion has lost much of
its function in the process of secular-
ization, the blow sustained is only a
superficial one .

Religion and Secular Science

Debunking the theory that religion
is at odds with science, Parsons saw
the two as co-workers. He said that
it was a favorite Puritan formula
that science is a way of coming to
know God through understanding
his works. Therefore, science is not
likely to be an attempt to find a
substitute for God.

He noted that there were many
Puritans in England’s Royal Society,

the most eminent being Robert
Boyle. Johnathan Edwards, New
England minister was _ probably

America’s greatest philosopher down
to recent years, the most important
single transmitter of the ideas of
Locke and Newton.

good professor’s characterization of
the legendary Lee as “Guardian
Angel Lee.”

The treatment of Henry Martin,
the founder of the Democratic ma-
chine in Virginia, is interesting but
couched in terms intended to im-
plement the author’s theme. The
final chapter deals with George C.
Marshall and it appears that Dr.
Fishwick might be attempting to
assist in the making of a new leg-
end here.

It seems surprising that though
the Marshall Plan and foreign policy
in Europe are lauded, the contro-
versial part played by Marshall dur-
ing the fall of China to commun-
ism is scarcely noted.

Wahoo Riots Well Recorded

While the memory of recent riots
at the University of Virginia lingers
in our minds, it might be worthwhile
to mention that Dr. Fishwick did an
admirable job in researching the his-
torical background of such phenom-

‘Gentlemen Of Virginia’ Reviewed

proceeded the Great Riot of 1836
was the punishment administered by
the students to a faculty member
who had rebuked a student in class
for the use of indecent language.
“Nor was the issue closed with
all that. Later on Harrison was ap-
prehended by two incensed members
of the student body. While one held

him tightly, the other ‘laid on vigor- |

ously with a stout horsewhip.’

“The increase of such bold acts
forced the faculty to pass on ordi-
nance ordering all students to their
rooms in case of rows or riots. That
did it. Irate cavaliers decreed a mass
meeting in Hotel C. Officials locked
the door; the students smashed it
down and entered. After some ap-
propriately inflamable remarks a
student resolution was adopted con-
demning the faculty order, and ad-
vising that it simply be ignored.
With that the students adjourned to
toast their good sense and breeding.”

Often Professor Fishwick is ac-
cused of being glib. At times he is;
how else explain the extraordinary
confusion of the word “ancestor”
for “descendant” which he no doubt
intended on page 158? Despite this
occasional lapse, much of what Mar-
shall Fishwick has to say is quite
profound.

And whether superficial or pro-
found, the way he expresses him-
self is always interesting and quite
often a hell of a lot of fun.

Henry Predicts Tough Season For Basketball Team

turn to big-time ball. It’s just that
we were wondering how it is that
schools like Randolph-Macon come
up with good basketball teams while
we're sweating out a .500 season.
Is it because no basketball play-
ers are smart enough to get in W&L?
We doubt it seriously. Instead, we
think that basketball players don’t

that he deserves recognition. As
linebacker for both the first and
second squads, he was the backbone
of a defense which shut out 4 op-
ponents, and yielded a scant 46
points all season.

 

Generals Lead Scoring

(Continued from page 3)
Other Generals placing in the
top ten were senior quarterback
Steve Suttle, with 30 points; junior
fullback Tommy Keesee, with 28;
and senior halfback Jim Russ, with
27.

come to W&L because frankly a
basketball player would be stupid
to come here.

It’s a disappointing situation for
team, coach and student body. A
re-assessment of Washington and
Lee’s basketball program is in order.

In closing, we want to say a word
of thanks to that honorable institu-
tion, the PE department, which
provided what might be the biggest
basketball crowd of the season last
Monday by making the game manda-
tory for all freshmen and sophomore
PE classes.

We are quite sure that it was a
most satisfying intellectual exper-
ience for all involved. We hope that
the administration will consider
making all home athletic events
compulsory.

Like required university assem-
blies, it would be a good and healthy
thing, and meaningful, too.
