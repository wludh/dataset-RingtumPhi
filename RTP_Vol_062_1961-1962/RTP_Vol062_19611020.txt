Record Crowd

Expected For
Parents’ Meet

The Dean’s office urges that
there be no student parking on
campus from Friday morning un-
til noon Saturday of Parents’
Weekend.

More than 850 parents and guests
of Washington and Lee University
students will visit the campus Oc-
tober 27-29 for the seventh annual
Parents’ Weekend.

Housing and luncheon ticket res-
ervations indicate the weekend at-
tendance may top any year since the
program was begun in 1955. Pur-
pose of the weekend is to provide
students’ parents with an oppor-
tunity to visit the campus, hold in-
dividual conferences with faculty
members and hear reports from uni-
versity student body officers.

A schedule similar to past week-
ends will keep the guests busy be-
ginning with registration at 10 a.m.
Friday and ending with a Glee
Club concert at 8:30 Saturday night.
Parents are invited to attend church
services of their choice Sunday
morning.

Advisory Council

Highpoint of Friday afternoon’s
activities will be a meeting of the
Parents’ Advisory Council in Evans
Dining Hall. Richard T. Edwards
of Roanoke is the 1961 chairman of
the council, and his successor will
be elected at this session.

Among top events of each parents’
weekend have been public faculty
discussions. Dr. Milton Colvin, as-
sociate professor of political science,
and Dr. Thomas P. Hughes, asso-
ciate professor of history, will talk
about “Berlin: A Problem for the
West.” They will speak in duPont
Auditorium. “Leftist Movements in
South America and the Economic
Stakes” will be discussed in Lee
Chapel by Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh
and Dr. Charles W. Turner, both
professors of history. These pro-
grams begin at 8 p.m. Friday.

University President and Mrs.
Fred C. Cole will entertain parents
at the president’s home following
the discussions.

The annual “Report to Parents” by
university administrative officers will
be the highlight of Saturday morn-
ing’s schedule. The program will
open with a talk by student body
President Andrew W. McThenia, Jr.,
of Alderson, West Va. The deans of
the College, School of Commerce
and Administration and the School
of Law and the dean of students will
will also give reports. President Cole
will close the program with a sum-
mary of his work.

Guest and faculty members will
attend a buffet luncheon from noon
until 1:45 p.m. in the university’s
dining hall.

A 2 p.m football game between
Washington and Lee and Emory and
Henry will climax the afternoon’s
activities for guests.

One of the most popular features
of past parents’ weekends has been
the opportunity to meet face to face
with faculty members during speci-
ally-aranged conferences. These will
be held Friday afternoon and Sat-
urday morning for interested par-
ents.

Parents’ Weekend—rated by the
American Alumni Council in 1959 as
the best in the nation—is under the
joint sponsorship of Washington
and Lee and the 50-member Par-
ents’ Advisory Council. This special
council is a body whose special in-
terest in the university affords an
effective communications channel
between Washington and parents.

Arrangements for the weekend are
made by a special faculty commit-
tee.

 

Collegian Will Appear
On Weekend of Nov. 18

The Southern Collegian will be
released on the Washington and
Lee campus on November 18. This
is a home football game weekend,
and is one week before Thanksgiving
vacation.

Publication of The Southern Col-
legian for Openings Dance Set was
unavoidably delayed due to color
printing difficulties out of town.
Were the Collegian staff capable of
regretting this delay and the in-
convenience suffered by W&L men
by not having the opportunity to
read the Collegian on schedule, it
certainly would regret it. How-
ever...

QUIZ BOWL FINALISTS included the above four students, pictured with Washington
and Lee Director of Publicity Frank Parsons. From left to right, they are Rusty McNab,

Parsons said that the team will be announced Monday.

Mock Quiz Bowl On WREL
Is Final Test For Team Berths

By SPENSER RAGSDALE

Quiz Bowl fever is still rampant.
As the tension upon the eight re-
maining boys mounts, speculation
is running high as to who our rep-
resentatives will be.

Thursday night radio station
WREL presented a simulated Quiz
Bowl program. Art Portnoy intro-
duced the program and said that
the accuracy, speed, and overall per-
formance of the boys during this
show would be collated with pre-
vious testing results to pick the four
members and two alternates that will
compose the team.

Frank Parsons explained the op-
eration of the show and asked the
various toss-up and bonus ques-
tions. The Blue Team consisted of
Tom Lybass, Jim Campbell, Ed
Brown, and Rusty McNab. Bill
Lowry, Cal Morrow, Rick Ander-
son, and Thorns Craven were on
the opposing Red Team.

“What is a lycanthrope?”
A buzzer sounded and Mr. Par-

 

sons asked the first question of the
evening: “If you came across a
‘lycanthrope, would you be most apt
to give him a big kiss, saddle him
up, run like crazy.” Jim Camp-
bell punched his bell and answered
correctly, “Run like crazy; it’s a
werewolf.”

The Blue Team thus gained the
advantage at the beginning of the
match. They were to maintain this
lead to a 230 to 95 half-time score
and throughout the second half, in
spite of the Red Team comeback,
to a 515 to 320 final victory.

Lybass Shines

The few people present during
the broadcasting were continually
astounded at the uncanny alarcity
of the eight minds. Tom Lybass,
deeply engrossed in his task, was
probably the outstanding performer
of the evening.

He handled the following bonus
question single-handedly: “All of the
following 20th Century novels de-
rive their titles from other literary
works. Identify the source of the

theatre, branched out into the movie
making business this week.

 

3 Professors

Doing Research

Three Washington and Lee pro-
fessors are studying or doing re-
search on leave of absence during
the 1961-1962 school session.

Dr. Jenks, a professor in the
history department, is doing research
in Vienna this year to gather mater-
ial for another book. He has re-
ceived a Social Science Research
Council Grant to write on the con-
dition of Austrian politics around
1910. Dr. Jenks is a specialist in
the field of Austrian history. In 1950
his The Austrian Electorial Reform
of 1907 was published by the Co-
lumbia University Press. More re-
cently his Vienna and the Young
Hitler was published by the same
press. This book describes the so-
cial and political conditions in Vien-
na just before and during the time
when the youthful Hitler was living
there and theorizes the effects of
this particular city on the mind and
character of Hitler.

Professor Robert R. Huntley is on
leave of absence for graduate study
under a fellowship at the Harvard
Law School. His classes are being
taught by visiting professor T. Mun-
ford Boyd of the University of Vir-
ginia Law School and by special
lecturer William O. Roberts, Jr., of
the Lexington Bar.

Mr. Brockman, instructor in ro-
mance languages, is studying in
anticipation of a Ph.D. at the Uni-
versity of Columbia. He is on a
Danforth Teachers Study Grant.

 

On location in Dr. Ed Hamer’s
back yard they shot a series of
scenes which will be used as part
of the upcoming production of Boy
Meets Girl.

Featured in the three-minute pre-
view type trailer, which will open
the second act of the play, are Bruce
Whelihan as Larry Toms, a great
western star, and Tim Morton as
his sidekick.

The star of the film, however, is
Billy Roberts, four-month-old son
of the Friday R-t P editor, who
makes his acting debut as Happy,
unchallenged infant prodigy and
youngest star in Hollywood history.

Boy Meets Girl, now in the final
stages of rehearsal, concerns the
antics of two of Hollywood’s zan-
iest writers, played by Andy Leonard
and Jerry Gray. This pair spends
more time dreaming up practical
jokes to make life miserable for
their producer, played by Phil Booth,
than writing.

The play relates the story of one
of their funniest gags—making a
star of the infant son of a studio
waitress. Susie Dunnell, wife of
Troubadour president John Dunnell,
will appear as the lucky mother.

Some of the play’s most hysteri-
cal and chaotic scenes occur when
this enterprise backfires on the
writers, and they have to scramble
to save their jobs.

Other major roles will be filled
by Steve Colvin as Rodney Bevan,
a young Englishman trying to break
into pictures; Ron Alenstein as a
typically greedy actor’s agent; and
Scott Iacone as a hack composer
of background music.

Boy Meets Girl will open the cur-
rent Troub season on Tuesday, Oct-
tober 31st with a run of four nights.

Tickets for Boy Meets Girl can
be obtained from any Troubadour
member.

 

titles.” The first was Steinbeck’s
In Dubious Battle; answer, Milton’s
Paradise Lost. Next Hemingway’s
The Sun Also Rises; from the Bible
(Tom said Ecclesiasties). Fitzgerald’s
Tender is the Night; Keats’ “Ode to
a Nightingale.” Faulkner’s The
Sound and the Fury; McBeth. Hux-
ley’s Brave New World; from The
Tempest.

A question in a lighter vein which
the boys were unable to handle was
as follows: “Name the contemporary
musician whose name describes what
would happen if you put a beer mug
on a hot stove.” Leonard Bern-
stein, of course.

Individual Scores

The following rundown will give
an indication of the performance of
the individual boys. The first num-
ber following a name is the number
of questions that he answered cor-
rectly and was first with the answer,
the second refers to the number of
questions correctly answered. Ly-
bass, 50, 55; Lowry, 45,51; Camp-
bell, 42,55; Anderson, 42,47; McNabb,
31, 45, Craven, 28, 42; Brown, 27,
44; and Marrow, 20, 42.

The team of four and the two al-
ternates will be decided upon by
Monday by Mr. Parsons on the basis
of extensive testing and individual
response during the radio show.
These six delegates to the CBS
program will be announced in the
Ring-tum Phi on Tuesday of next
week.

campus.

No reason was given by the board for declining the UCA

 

Debating Frat
Will Initiate
11 Members

More than 65 Persons from col-
leges around the state will partici-
pate in the initiation of the newly
formed Washington and Lee chapter
of Tau Kappa Alpha here Friday.

The honorary forensic and debate
fraternity will initiate 11 persons as
charter members. The six students
from the undergraduate school are:
William P. Boardman, Richard Kel-
ly, Al Eckes, Richard McEnally,
William Noell and John Harcourt.

Of the five receiving honorary
membership, three graduated last
year from the undergraduate school.
They are William Bice, George Bird-
song and Pete Straub.

The two members of the faculty
receiving membership are Dr. A.
Ross Borden, acting chairman of
the English Department, and Wil-
liam W. Chaffin, head of forensic
activities at W&L and sponsor of
the new chapter.

The day’s activities will include
18 rounds of discussion and six
rounds of debate, to be held between
2-4:45 p.m. Members of W&L,
Bridgewater, VMI, Richmond and
Roanoke Colleges will participate. .

Following this a panel composed
of W&L faculty members will dis-
cuss the national debate question,
“Resolved that labor unions will be
subject to the jurisdiction of anti-
trust legislation.” Participating in
the discussion will be Dr. C. F.
Phillips, Jr., Dr. E. C. Griffith, Prof.
J. M. Gunn, Jr., Dr. Milton Colvin
and Prof. C. V. Laughlin.

Executive Committee of the UCA
voted—subject to the approval of
the Faculty Committee on Christian
Work— to invite the controversial
Negro minister to lead a UCA sem-
inar on “Christian Ethics and Non-
Violent Protest in Race Relations.”

The faculty committee discussed
the issue last week and voted to
recommend to President Cole and
the Board of Trustees that the
student group be allowed to in-
vite Dr. King to lead the seminar.

The board gave us an answer,
but no excuse,” Dr. Louis Hodges,
faculty advisor for the UCA, said
about the refusal.

In discussing the matter, Dr.
Hodges told a reporter, “I have two
things I want to say. First, this
action has been taken, and the issue
of inviting Dr. King under the aus-
pices of the UCA is closed.

“Second, and this is a personal
opinion, I stand with the faculty
committee and their recommenda-
tion. I feel that Dr. King should be
invited to this campus.”

Last year Dr. King appeared at
the University of Virginia, and this
spring at the University of Cali-
fornia—where he was reportedly
properly received.

Dr. King first came to prominence
several years ago for his part in
school integration and the “passive
resistance” program. More recently
he has been active as a leader in
the Negro sit-ins and freedom riders
movements in the South. Several at-
tempts have been made on his life.

Speaking about Dr. King, Dr.
Hodges said, “he is a man most
qualified to speak on Christian
ethics and non-violence. He knows
not only the theory of integration,
but the application of this theory,
also.

“He is quiet in lecture, and ex-

“Operation Abolition” Inspires Crowd
To Sneers, Jeers, Laughter and Cheers

By STEVE SMITH

“Operation Abolition” was pre-
sented at Washington and Lee Tues-
day night before an audience of
over 200 and provoked an expected
hail of criticism and controversy.

Sponsored by the Conservative
Society of W&L, the film was shown

in duPont Hall jammed 25 minutes
prior to flick time. The auditorium
seats only about 120 persons.

The showing provoked laughter,
applause, fiery sarcastic comment,
and a bet of a fifth of bourbon.
Intense interest was exhibited by
over one hundred who remained af-

 

Conservative Consciences—Arthur and Goldsboro

 

 

ter the film for a prolonged question
and answer period, with former
House investigator Robert Goldsboro
the target.

Goldsboro, well qualified for com-
ment on the story because of his
connection with the House Com-
mittee on Un-American Affairs, sub-
ject of the film, was in warm water
several times during this period.
The questions asked were searching
and feeling was intense.

The 28-minute documentary
movie, taken by television cameras,
evoke laughter and applause itself.
Most of the laughter came at the
expense of so-called Communist
leaders of the filmed riots.

Most of the questions asked from
the floor after the film concerned
distortions and discrepancies in the
story. Senior Ron Stein drew ap-
plause when he pointed out the
fact that the film classes all dem-
onstrators against the Committee as
either Communists or dupes. Hun-
dreds of students which protested
fell into neither of these categories.

A bet of a fifth of bourbon was
proposed to Goldsboro by Dr. Milton
Colvin, who denied a statement made
by both the film and Goldsboro.
Colvin wanted to check the law li-
brary to prove his point, but Golds-
boro pleaded a long drive ahead of
him and declined the offer.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

We Protest!

The University Board of Trustees has refused the Univer-
sity Christian Association’s request that Dr. Martin Luther
King be invited to participate in a UCA-sponsored seminar
here on “Christian Ethics and Non-Violent Protest in Race
Relations.”

The editors of the Friday Ring-tum Phi consider the Board’s
action inexcusable, and sincerely protest the decision.

Dr. King is symbolic of a moral, social and economic prob-
lem of the utmost significance. As such, his views are paticularly
relevant to the study of that problem.

By its refusal to let Dr. King appear, the Board of Trustees
has seriously violated the rights of the student body of this
University—a University supposedly dedicated to the spirit of
free inquiry.

Appalled by the Board’s action, we call upon the faculty
and the student body to voice their opinions.

 

Why Not? |

Every year someone or another comes out in favor of |
abolishing the Assimilation Committee. This year Protest did, |
but in a rather weak manner, as if to say that there really wasn’t
much hope.

Well, we think there ought to be. We’re not at all sure
that the Assimilation Committee deserves to be continued.

In the first place, if a student is forced to dress better than
he normally would, any prestige we gain from our appearance
here is false. Why try to please visitors to the campus by setting
up a committee to make sure everyone looks nice? If so, why
not call the committee the “Make us all look like Nice Little
Boys Committee”?

We do think that most students respect the tradition of
conventional dress and would wear coats and ties to class and on
other appropriate occasions. We know some of them wouldn’t.
They would stick out like a sore thumb and no doubt damage
our reputation. But if there were no enforcement and a man’s
clothing were left to his own discretion, we think that it could
be a respected tradition and not just another rule.

The Assimilation Committee does perform a useful func-
tion in enforcing freshman assimilation regulations. Like all
freshman rules, these are largely artificial and have to be en-
forced. But the enforcement is too much a legal matter, too
much a question of law and order.

We would like to see every upperclassman have the right

to mete out mild punishments in the forms of pushups or some
other beneficial exercises—physical or intellectual—for failure
to wear one’s beanie. Perhaps a committee could be set up to
handle flagrant violators and to oversee the enforcement of
the rules.

This pushup business smacks, of course, too much of the
collegiate dark ages 10 or 15 years ago, when every student
cared about his university or fraternity and took it as his highest
duty to uphold her honor, even if violence were necessary. The
Assimilation Committee long ago took that out of our hands.
We would like to see it put back on a man-to-man basis.

We're tired of matters which are everybody’s business
being put into the hands of a committee. What becomes a
committee’s business ceases to be everybody’s.

Washington and Lee is neither too big nor too heterogenous
to put these matters in the hands of the individual student. Why
doesn’t someone have the courage to stand up and push
through a constitutional amendment to put Assimilation where
it belongs?

Why doesn’t someone stand up and say “‘T’ll see to it that
those d--- freshmen wear their d--- beanies, and I think it’s my
own business what I wear.”

Conservative Chaos

When the Conservative Society was formed last year,
we were skeptical, but interested. The membership list was
impressive, and we were willing to listen. Above all, we hoped
that the Society would attempt to state clearly the principles of
Conservatism, showing that these principles could be practically
applied to national government.

Well, so far, the Society has made no such attempt. This
was especially apparent in last Tuesday’s showing of Operation
Abolition. This film was pure propaganda, designed to arouse
indignation, and did not represent a careful analysis of Com-
munist methods. It belonged to the same genre as the sentation-
alized newsreels of the Montgomery race riots, and was an in-
sult to the intelligence of the duPont Hall audience.

And yet the Society, or at least the Society’s speaker, chose
to defend the film. Are we to assume that this is the way in
which Conservatism intends to inform the public of their prin-
ciples? If so, it appears that the Conservatives, like the Com-
munists, are trying to “dupe”? unwary students.

HUAC Enigma Needs Evaluation
From ‘Right’ And ‘Left’ Extremes

By JOHN PAUL

Our nation is one wherein the
higher political ideals of man have
gained a measure of fulfillment. Our
heritage is that of a maximum of
individual freedom in an ordered
society. It is for this partially achiev-
ed vision of a land insuring free-
dom and justice to all that Amer-
ica should hope to be remembered.

In an age of tension it is only
natural that what freedoms do exist
in America should be guarded, and
with zeal, by those who have the
wisdom to see the incredible value
of our attainment.

Tuesday night, during the discus-
sion following the showing of the
film “Operation Abolition” we wit-
nessed a display of conflicting minds.
Yet, upon consideration, it would
seem that these minds have a com-
mon meeting point: their motivation.
For apparently they have mutually
been urged to their respective po-
sitions by an earnest desire to pre-
serve that fragile balance which is
the American political achievement.

Some men (shall we refer to them
as the “Right’?) have chosen to
place emphasis upon the hostility
and aggression of our political en-
emies, the danger of subversion, and
the necessity of sacrificing certain of
our political ideals in order to pre-
serve the general welfare. These
men of the “Right” see investigat-
ing committees as a necessary tool
for the preservation of the repub-
lic.

Others (and for simplicity of term-
inology let us refer to them as the
“Left”) have seen investigating com-
mittees of the nature of HUAC as
endangering freedom of expression
and association as witch hunts
and would have them abolished.

I invite these two groups to re-
consider. I wish to ask for a return
to the common meeting ground in
order that constructive approaches
may be launched.

I feel it incumbent upon me, as an
individual, to point out to the
“Right” that the HUAC represents
a departure from our traditional
concept of law—that a man charged
with a crime should be given a fair
trial in a court of law. A man should

not be forced to face a legislative
committee to answer for his beliefs
where such appearance may ex-
pose him to sanctions in the nature
of economic pressure or public scorn
due in part to intimation, smear,
or innuendo. It is further empha-
sized that the powers granted to
such a committee should be consid-
ered emergency powers and_ that
adequate safeguards against abuse
should be provided.

Many individual Americans be-
lieve that in the case of HUAC the
abuse outweighs the constructive
accomplishments. “Operation Abo-
lition” may express a _ one-sided
point of view in giving the impres-
sion that since Communists oppose
HUAC, then all who oppose HUAC
are either Communists or dupes.
That the film might be so interpreted
is a danger which I call upon fair-
minded persons to consider.

I feel I should also admonish the
“Left” that we are facing at this

 

time a continuing threat of sub-
version and deception by those in-
imical to our cherished political in-
stituitons. The record of Communism
in America is sufficient to remind
us of this threat. Therefore, to fail
to recognize the usefulness of such
an invetigating committee is per-
haps to disregard some unpleasant
facts. It is the value of an investi-
gating committee, as a legislative
device to insure freedom through
law, that the “Left” must appreciate.
Too often the “Left” sees the threat
but not the value.

In summary, abolition of the
Committee is not my answer. I call
for a positive and responsible eval-
uation of the Committee and for
the enactment of corrective safe-
guards. This undertaking to be done
to the end that our system may
continue to flourish; that there be a
conservation of our traditional right;
and that freedom and justice under
law may be liberally dispersed
throughout our land.

 

 

A Brief But Important Discourse
On Crumbling Campus Traditions

By STEVE HENRY

The faculty has seen fit to ban the
time-honored group, the Hot-Nuts,
from our fair campus.

Viewed in retrospect, its action
seems both belated and necessary.
The Hot-Nuts are gross, crude, un-
refined, and generally out-of-taste.
In other words, they are perfectly
in keeping with Washington and Lee
party traditions.

As a matter of fact, the Hot-Nuts
are one of our greatest traditions,
ranking right up there with the
speaking tradition, conventional
dress, and the good old apple barrel.

The average man on the street,
however casually he might be ac-
quainted with the academic excel-
lence of our university, is fully
aware of the fact that Washington
and Lee is “where that nifty com-
bo plays—the one with all the nasty
lines.”

When one considers thiis pertinent
fact, the faculty’s action seems al-
most revolutionary. After all, if
breaking a tradition here is almost
a cardinal sin, what is the penalty
for abolishing one?

What’s the faculty trying to do,
anyway? Ruin our good name on
the Atlantic seaboard? Heaven for-
bid.

We can still remember the words
of that venerable guardian of W&L
traditions, who cried out for the
world to hear that “as long as there’s
a Washington and Lee, they’ll never
get rid of the Nuts.”

What is a person to think? The
foundations of the schools are
crumbling before us.

The next thing you know, they’ll
do away with something that really
means something around here. Like

the speaking tradition or required |

assemblies. Once again, heaven for-

bid.

 

But back to the Nuts.

We would like to propose a short
psychological exercise for those of
you who are not especially fond of
this group.

1. Free yourself from all worldly
matters. Be natural. Return entire-
ly to the primitive. Only then can
you appreciate what the Nuts are
trying to do.

2. Repeat over and over to your-
self, “The Nuts are not any grosser
or cruder than I am. I use the same
words every day, and I have not
been banned (yet, anyway).

3 Who am I to cast judgment on
a group of hard-working, industrious
gentlemen who are striving to make
a living the best way they know
how?

SOCCER ACTION IN yesterday’s game between Washington and Lee and

Duke University. Nationally ranked Duke won 11-2 against an inexperi-

enced General squad, which was hurt by poor defense and sluggish offense.
Outstanding for W&L was freshman Gil Slingerland.

 

Generals Risk Streak,
Face Johns Hopkins

Undefeated Washington and Lee meets undefeated Johns
Hopkins in Baltimore Saturday, and both teams think they
have a score to settle with the other one.

The Generals, with a 3-0 record for the current campaign,
want to get even for the 8-8 standoff in 1960 which put the only

 

blot on an otherwise unblemished
8-0-1 season mark.

The Blue Jays want to prove that
they should have beaten the Gen-
erals, if it hadn’t been for a goal-
line fumble on one occasion and a
touchdown-killing penalty on an-
other.

Records

W&L is fresh from a 43-0 conquest
of Randolph-Macon, while the Jays
matched the Generals’ 350 yards
in total offense but nevertheless
were battled to a scoreless standstill
at Haverford.

So far, Saturday’s opponents have
met one common foe, Franklin and
Marshall. Johns Hopkins beat the
Diplomats, 13-0, while the Generals
bumped F&M a week later, 40-0.
But W&L Coach Lee McLaughlin
doesn’t take much stock in compara-
tive scores, for the situation was
generally the same in 1960 when it
was 12-6 Hopkins and 38-8 W&L
over the F&M team. The Jays also
have beaten Ursinus, 13-8.

Assistant Coach Boyd Williams,
who has scouted Hopkins twice for
W&L adds, “There’s no doubt in
my mind but what Johns Hopkins is
the finest team we’ve seen since we
played them last year.”

The Jays have Henry Ciccarone at
tailback and Phil Sutley at fullback,
and the Generals recall these boys
as the chief agents in an attack
that rocked W&L on its heels for
most of the game last year.

Ciccarone is a fine passer, com-
pleting 13 of 25 passes in the rain
against Haverford, While Sutley is

a workhorse, carrying the ball 32
times for nearly 100 yards against
the Fords.

“We learned a valuable lesson
last year,’ recalls McLaughlin. “I
hope we’ll be able to tackle bet-
ter this time. That Sutley makes
you look bad if you don’t get him
low and hard.”

McLaughlin allowed that he
didn’t think the W&L squad would
have any trouble “getting up” for
the Johns Hopkins game. It will be
the third time that McLaughlin’s
team have met the Jays, and the
Generals have yet to win. In 1957,
it was 13-12 for Johns Hopkins.

Offense Bright

After sputtering in the opening
game, the Generals’ offense has
been effective enough to please Mc-
Laughlin in the past two weeks.
Juniors Tommy Keesee and Charley
Gummey, promoted from the second
to the first units after the 7-6 win
over Hampden-Sydney, have re-
sponded admirably to new respon-
sibilities.

Gummey has scored three touch-
downs and three conversion runs
while contributing 115 yards rush-
ing at 4.1 yards a carry. Keesee has
no points, but he’s right behind
Gummey with 108 yards rushing at
4.9 yards a try.

The Generals’ Little All-Ameri-
can linebacker, Terry Fohs, con-
tinues to spark a W&L defense that
has limited three opponents to an

Tennis, Golf
Playoffs Set

By HOWIE KORMAN

With the tennis and golf seasons
completed, the I-M football program
started October 17. PiKA, Beta, and
Phi Psi all shut out their opponents.

Defending champion PiKA scored
two touchdowns in the first half to
hand Phi Gam a 13-0 setback.
Quarterback Nicky Smith faded
back early in the first period and
threw Cy Painter a 40-yard toss for
the initial TD. Just before the half-
time, Smith spotted his right half-
beck alone in the end zone and hit
him with a perfect 30-yard pass to
meke the score 13-0.

Peced by the signal calling of Ray
Gordon, the Betas easily downed
the Sigma Nu’s, 19-0. Late in the
second quarter Gordon put his team-
mates into the lead as he scored
on a six yard run around right end.
A short pass from Gordon to his
left end made the score board read
13-0 at the half. In the final period,
quarterback Gordon intercepted a
stray Sigma Nu pass and raced for
the final touchdown of the day.

In the other contest on Tuesday,
Phi Kap completely overran the
Lambda Chi’s, 26-0. Scoring in every
period, the victors showed strength
on both offense and defense.

On October 18, three more games
were played, with the Delts winning
by forfeit, Phi Psi by 21-0, and the
representatives from the law school
playing KA to a draw.

Leading Phi Psi to victory over
Kappa Sig was freshman speedster
Dick Kreitler. Kreitler scored first
on a long run, and then was on the
receiving end of a TD pass thrown
by Lou Mongeau. Mongeau also hit
Dave Britt with a pass for the final
score of the game.

In the law-KA encounter each
team was able to gain enough yard-
age for five first downs; but neither
was able to cross the goal line.

Tennis

The I-M tennis schedule was co-
pleted during the week with only
two of the four league champions
decided.

In League A the netters from
PiKA ended the season with a per-
fect record by downing Lambda
Chi. The losers captured second
place with two wins in four matches.

A protest concerning the Oc-
tober 12 match between Phi Kap
and SAE is holding up the final
standings in Division B. To date
these houses have identical 2-1
records.

The decision that will be handed
down by the I-M board will break
the tie and decide first place.

Frosh Set For
AMA Game
This Afternoon

After two bruising losses, Wash-
ington and Lee’s freshman football
team steps into its own “class of
competition” Friday.

The Baby Generals meet Augusta
Military Academy at 3:15 p.m. on
W&L’s Wilson Field.

Augusta brings a 1-1-1 record
and a 200-pound line to Lexington,
but freshman coach Dana Swan
thinks his Baby Generals can stay
with the larger invaders.

“We had hoped to platoon against
Augusta, but we have nine first
stringers out with injuries. Now
we'll have to counter their size with
conditioning instead of depth.”

But the injury picture isn’t quite
as bleak as it might appear. Fullback
Bruce Kurtz and guard Brooks
Brown are both returning to duty
and a newcomer, 200-pound guard
Louis Rex, adds strength in the line.

“The return of Kerts and Brown
takes some of the sting out of our
injuries, but most of our boys will
have to play both offense and de-
fense,’ Swan emphasized. “We had
hoped to keep a fresh unit in the
game at all times against Augusta.”

During the week’s layoff since
W&L’s 33-0 loss to Ferrum Junior
College, Swan has corrected two of
the Baby Generals’ worst faults.

“Ferrum beat us on traps. Our
guards hadn’t been educated but
they’ll never get trapped again. We
worked hard on the trap last week
and we think our guards can defense
it very well now.”

The other problem—offensive
blocking—is also “100 per cent im-
proved.”

“We were opening the holes,”
Swan explained, “but we weren’t
keeping them open. Now we’re stay-
ing with our blocks.”

The Baby Generals stand 0-2 for
their seven-game schedule.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Basketball

Practice

Gets Underway Here

By STEVE HENRY

Pre-season basketball practice at Washington and Lee got
underway this week, with only four lettermen returning from
last year’s squad that managed a 7-11 overall record, including
a stunning upset over the University of Virginia.

With only two men over 672” available for action, W&L

head coach Bob McHenry faces a*

problem to which he’s grown ac-
customed—how to play winning col-
lege basketball without adequate
height.

As if that weren’t enough, he’s
also hurting for experience.

Not one of the top ten men on
last year’s edition were seniors, giv-
ing every indication that this year
McHenry would be working with a
reasonably experienced ball club.

But injuries, flunk-outs, and aca-
demic deficiencies have left Mc-
Henry holding the bag.

Ide, Fauber

Only Captain Bip Fauber and
Bill Ide return from last year’s start-
ing five.

Fauber, who at 6’2” could be the
best basketball player his size in
Virginia, is a sure starter at the
forward position.

Ide, a guard last year, has been
moved into a forward slot opposite
Fauber.

At the guards, McHenry is count-
ing on a group of talented trans-
fers, headed by Jon and Tom Su-
pac, a set of 61” twins who moved
over to W&L from William and
Mary.

Don Wallis, a transfer from the
University of Pennsylvania, is an-
other backcourter for whom Mc-
Henry has high hopes this year.

Pivot

But the Generals will be weakest
at the center position, and nobody
knows it better than McHenry.

“We just don’t have a pivot man.

 

 

Until then, McHenry will either
have to find a pivot man or make
one.

He’s got a prime candidate in
64” Howard Martin, a sophomore
who moves up from Coach Joe
Lyles’ freshman team.

Martin, a good shooter, could
solve McHenry’s problem at the
center position, but only if he grows
more aggressive.

“He’s not aggressive enough,” says
McHenry. “They’d kill him on the
boards.”

Two freshman _ prospects—6’4”
John Marshall and 65” Gene
Pearce—could make the grade, but
both lack the experience under the
boards needed for college ball.

Four other freshmen are also
working out with the General var-
sity, including George Madison,
Richard Brown, Louie Paterno, and
Carol Klinglehoffer.

Lettermen

In addition to Ide and Fauber,
two other lettermen are back from
last year. They are Bill Smith and
Dave Grogan, both of whom saw
heavy action during the late season.

Grogan came up with several key
baskets in the W&L win over Ran-
dolph-Macon and UVa, and Smith
did more than an adequate job on
defense.

Smith may even get moved into
the pivot this year, even though he
stands only 6’2”. Grogan is 6’1”.

Mozart Opera
Is Scheduled
For Lexington

Mozart’s comic opera, Cosi Fan
Tutte, will be presented in English
translation by the Turnau Opera
Players at 8:15 p.m. Wednesday in
Waddell School in Lexington.

The performance by the young
American singing group signals the
opening of the 1961-62 Rockbridge
Concert-Theater Series.

The Series is presently conducting
a membership drive, to continue
through this weekend. Tickets may
be purchased at White’s Furniture
and Music Store or from Dr. Ley-
burn. Student season tickets are
$7.00.

Cosi Fan Tutte concerns two sis-
ters, their respective lovers, a bit-
ter old bachelor, and a designing old
maid. The action takes place in the
Naples of the 1790’s, and is filled
with humorous twists and comic
complications.

The two lovers are talked into
putting their sweethearts to the test
by the old bachelor, who says that
all women are fickle. They disguise
themselves as Albanian officers and
visit the two sisters, succeeding to
their dismay in making some head-
way with each others’ girls.

After a treasurehouse of compli-
cations and misunderstandings arise,
everything is solved and all “live
happily ever after.”

Hot Nuts Are Defended

As Venerable Tradition

musical form has been appreciated
at first. The sound of the Nuts may
be the sound of a generation—a
sound full of great significance. Let
us not close our minds to the pos-
sibility that someday we might be
proud to say that “Washington and
Lee was the only school broad-
minded enough to give full rein to
the Hot Nuts’ new Musical forms.”
5. Consider briefly the fundamen-
tal problem: How did the speakers
get in the windows in the first
place. It’s a safe bet that the Nuts
didn’t give two hoots about per-
forming for the entire city of Lex-
ington.
Until you have adjusted your
mind to the above way of thinking,
you are probably incapable of cast-
ing a valid judgment on the Nuts.
So we would humbly ask you to
try the liberal way. It is the only
way for our school to survive.
Besides, without the Nuts, what
is there going to be to talk about
at home?
