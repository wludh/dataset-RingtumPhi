Record Attendance Expected
For Annual Parents’ Weekend;

New Conference

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

Washington and Lee University will play host to some
800 mothers, fathers, and guardians of students for the sev-
enth annual Parents’ Weekend on October 27, 28, 29.

Advanced reservations for housing and tickets to the par-
ents’ luncheon show that attendance for the weekend will prob-

ably be the largest since the pro-*

gram was begun in 1955.

Parents’ Weekend is under the
sponsorship of the University and
the Parents’ Advisory Council, with
arrangements for housing and pro-
grams handled by the University
Development Office.

Registration for parents and other
guests will open at 10 am. Friday
and will continue until 9 p.m. that
night. Parents wishing conferences
will be able to meet faculty mem-
bers that afternoon.

Procedure Different

This year the procedure for ar-
ranging conferences will be some-
what different than that in the past.
Conferences will have to be made
by the student with faculty mem-
bers instead of the former method
of arranging them through the Uni-
versity Development Office. Stu-
dents are urged to make these ap-

pointments as soon as possible with |

their professors.

On Friday afternoon, The Parents’
Advisory Council will meet at 2:30
in the conference room of Evans
Dining Hall. Richard T. Edwards of
Roanoke is the 1961 chairman of
the council.

Chemistry Talk

Also on Friday afternoon the
chemistry department will hold its
weekly seminar and tea. Mr. J. W.
Reynolds will speak on “Free Radi-
cal Mechanisms.”

For the Friday night discussions
this year, the subjects will center
around two of the present trouble
spots of the world.

In duPont Auditorium at 8:00 the
topic for discussion will be “Berlin:
a Problem for the West” and “A
Problem for the Soviet Bloc.” Dr.
Milton Colvin, associate professor
of political science will take the
Western side, and Associate Pro-
fessor of History Dr. T. P. Hughes
will take the side of the Soviet
Union. Presiding at this session will
be Steve Galef.

“Leftist Movements”

The second discussion group will
concern “Leftist Movements in
South America,” and both Dr. Leon
F. Sensabaugh, Professor of History
and Dr. Charles W. Turner will dis-
cuss this problem. The group will

meet in Lee Chapel also at 8:00.

The highlight of the Saturday
schedule will be the “Report to
Parents” by University and stu-
dent body officials. The 11:00 am.
program will open with a talk by
Uncas McThenia, president of the
student body. This report will be
followed by talks from Dr. William
W. Pusey, dean of the college; Dr.
Lewis W. Adams, dean of the school
of commerce and administration;
Professor Charles P. Light, dean of
the school of law; and Frank J. Gil-
liam, dean of students and director
of admissions.

President Fred C. Cole will close
the program in Doremus Gymnasium
with a report on his work and the

 

University as a whole.

| Final Testing

For Bowl Team

\Is Tomorrow

A final testing session Wed-
nesday night will narrow the
field of candidates for Wash-
ington and Lee’s GE College
Bowl team to eight sharp-wit-
ted students.

The four finalists who will
make up the team for the Novem-
ber 12 appearance on CBS network
television will be selected following
a “dress rehearsal” live radio broad-
cast over WREL Thursday at 9 p.m.

John K. Jennings, director of the
Communications Laboratory of the
Lee Memorial Journalism Founda-
tion, has arranged for a 45-minute
show patterned after the old Col-
lege Quiz Bowl, the radio predeces-
sor of the current popular TV ser-
ies.

Two Teams Compete

The eight semi-finalists will be
divided into two teams of four each,
and the game will involve “toss-
up” and “bonus” questions fired at
the participants by Frank Parsons,

university staff member who has #
Se

assisted in the preliminary selection
process.

Although team scores will be kept,
Parsons will rely on individual rec-
ords
finalists to four .

475 Questions Asked

To date, candidates have been sub-
jected to some 175 written-answer
questions designed to determine the
breadth of their knowledge in many
fields, and nearly 300 oral-answer
questions designed to indicate the
rapidity with which the candidates
can recall specific fact.

Plans are also in the works for
an appearance on area television a
week prior to the network show
from New York. The team has been
invited to appear on “College on
Camera,” a Sunday afternoon half-
hour program over WDBJ-TV,
Channel 7, in Roanoke, on November
5. The show, taped in advance on
October 31, would involve inter-
views with team members and an|
abbreviated contest among _ indivi-
duals with College Bowl type ques-
tions.

Two Alternates

Although the GE College Bow!
makes no call for the selection of
alternates for the team, Parsons said
he planned to select two alternates
who would be available for the New|
York trip in the event of sickness |
or other incapacity of one or more|
of the regulars.

The Washington and Lee team will
travel to New York on November 11

Sunday, November 12.

 

The controversial “Hot Nuts
Combo” has been officially banned
from the W&L campus, members of
the IFC were told last night.

The rule, which was handed down
to the IFC by the Office of the Dean
of Students, goes further in the
bann—it says the group cannot ap-
at any function on or off campus.

The rule, Assistant Dean of
Student James D. Farrar, said,
applies to all 18 fraternities and to
all social organizations, fraternal
or otherwise.

Dean Farrar reported that the
action resulted from a series of com-
plaints received on the combo this
past weekend.

Complaints came in from members |
of the faculty and from alumni, he

 

said.
“Hot Nuts” Have a History

In 1959, the “Hot Nuts” first took |
the spotlight. On Oct. 12, 1959, the!
IFC debated the issue at consider-|
able length. The debate resulted in|
a request to the fraternities that!

they use descrition in hiring the
the group.

At that time it was felt that a
ban would not solve the problem,
as it was felt that each house
should see that the combo did not
play “off-color” songs.

In the Spring of 1958 this combo
was the focal point of a near riotous
fraternity party which had to be
quelled by Lexington Police.

Automatic Rule Explained
In other business last night, copies
of the new automatic rule were dis- |
tributed to the fraternity officers |
by Dean Farrar.

W&L Freshmen Better Qualified

 

The Tuesday Staff Speaks .. .

 

EMPHASIS

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

With the ever increasing number of applications, colleges in the
United States have been forced to become more selective.

Here at W&L the increase in applicants has been noticed. How-

ever, in the past four years, the incoming freshman classes have
remained approximately the same size. Rather than increasing the
student body, the calibre of tht student has been raised.
Each year, more and more is required of the candidates for admis-
sion to W&L. Next year for the first time, the Scholastic Achieve-
ment Tests will be required of each aplicant as well as the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.

The Achievement Tests consist of an English test as well as two
tests from either the natural science, mathematics, foreign languages
or social studies groups. With the additional information from these
tests, the admissions staff will have more knowledge on a candidate’s
abilities.

Over the past four years, the Scholastic Aptitude scores of in-
coming freshmen have continually increased. Each year, both the
verbal and math medians of the classes have risen over that of past
classes.

Year Verbal Math
1958 528 553
1959 532 563
1960 554 577
1961 565 599

Out of 1252 high school seniors who presented completed apli-
cations to W&L for considerations this fall, 542 acceptances were
issued. Those accepted represents 42 per cent of the total making
complete applications for admission. Of the 542 who received ac-
ceptances, 318 enrolled this year as freshmen. It is significant to note
that 73 per cent of the freshmen accepted were in the top quarter
of their high school classes.

The Admissions Staff has increased its efforts to find better qual-
ified students for W&L. A greater emphasis is being placed upon
sending representatives from W&L to the different public and private
schools. This enables the Admissions Staff to more carefully screen
the perspective applicants.

Another example of the increased selectivity of the Admissions
Staff has been the growth of the student body in respect to the size
of the classes accepted. While freshmen classes have remained ap-
proximately the same size over the past four years, the student body
has increased by 85. This shows that the incoming students are bet-

.ter prepared and that larger numbers are remaining for graduation.

The faculty has been doing its part in increasing the standards of
the school. Over the past four years, the faculty has been increased.
Also, more members of the faculty now hold doctorate degrees than
ever before. In addition, new research grants have been obtained
and research work has been stimulated.

New construction has been another area of expansion and im-
provement. Next year, a new freshman dormitory will be completed.
While the freshman class is expected to be approximately 330, an
increase of only ten students, better facilities will be offered. The
new science building marks another step forward in the improvement
of the University. The new building will provide more modern fa-
cilities for students in all academic classes. However, it is noteworthy
that W&L is expanding its facilities to meet the new academic
challenge.

Today, the curriculum has been expanded to meet the needs of
the “New Age” freshmen. This year marks the instigation of a
new and more advanced course in mathematics. The old freshman
math course has given way to a more comprehensive and complete
one. The English Department has also expanded to meet the needs
of the new freshmen. This year, the advanced section has been en-
larged because of the increased number of freshmen who qualify
for advanced placement.

In addition, more is now expected of the new freshmen. New
academic restrictions have been placed upon them. The automatic
rule has been raised and a higher grade point ratio is now required.
Also, the absence regulations have been tightened. Now,

ball, was co-captain of the varsity
wrestling team, lettered in varsity
track, was a member of the debate
team, and was elected to the school’s
literary society.

In the last half of the eleventh
grade, Boiarsky attended Atherton
High School where he edited the
literary magazine and ran varsity
track.

Transferring to Wagner High
School in his senior year, he was
editor-in-chief of the literary maga-
zine and ran varsity track.

At Washington and Lee, Boiarsky
is a reporter for the Ring-tum Phi.
He said that he also plans to join
the wrestling and track teams when
the seasons open.

A University-Owned Parking Lot

Needs Immediate Attention

One of the most prevalent problems that presently con-
fronts Washington and Lee seems to be the parking situation.
We find that this problem not only is confined to our cam-
pus, but that the dilemma also extends to University proper-
ty located off campus.

Specifically, we are speaking of the University owned
parking lot located next to the Pi Kappa Alpha house and
behind the Beta Theta Pi house.

From information gathered from officials of one of these
houses, it seems that a number of pleas which have requested
improvements for this lot have fallen on deaf ears.

Officials of this fraternity have more than once requested
action to remedy the poor condition of this lot, but their re-
quests have been to no avail.

Members of the PiKA fraternity are forced to park their
cars on Main Street, since the lot is in such poor condition
that it is virtually impossible to get cars on it. As a result
of having to park on a main street, three of the PiKA’s cars
have been involved in accidents this year alone. The expense
of these collisions, it seems to us, is unnecessary, and with

 

This picture shows the shabby condition of the University- owned parking lot next to the PiKA house.

a decent place to park these expenses would not be necessary.

Both the above named fraternities have agreed to pay
for having the lot surfaced with gravel if the University
would have the area graded with their machinery. Action was
promised last spring, but still no work has been done on the
lot.

Another added imposition resulting from the poor con- *

munism, and its goal is to show the American public the ser-

iousness of that threat to our

way of life.

It is our hope that Washington and Lee students will take
the time tonight to see this film. We can promise you that
the time spent viewing “Operation Abolition” will not be

wasted.

houses to get service from food distributors, since they can-
not get their trucks in and out of the lot.

It seems to us that with co-operation from the University
this problem could easily be solved.
A request by students to the University that results in
no action is not characteristic of this Administration. We
hope that a “no help” trend has not started here.

Don’t Miss ‘Operation Abolition’

Tonight’s showing of ‘Operation Abolition” should at-
tract a large crowd of viewers, for this film is reported to be
one of the most controversial pictures that has been distrib-
uted during the last few years.

The film, as we understand it, gives an “inside view” of
Communist activities which are taking place within the
United States today, and the subject centers around the re-
cent rioting that marked a session of the House Un-American
Activities Committee which was meeting in San Francisco

rounded series of laboratory experi-
ments and lectures will be presented,
covering the basic radioactive count-
ing techniques and applications of
radioisotopes in the fields of biology,
chemistry, and physics.

Special Training

The Mobile Lab program is de-
signed to provide faculty members
and advanced science majors at un-
dergraduate institutions the oppor-
tunity for specialized training in
the techniques and applications of
radioisotopes.

The present program and mobile
lab is the only one of its kind in
the United States. In 1958 two mobile
laboratories were built by the Oak
Ridge Institute for Nuclear Studies
(ORINS) for the International Atom-
ic Energy Agency in Geneva. These
were donated to the agency and
have been in constant use in Europe
and South America since that time.
In 1959, when the value of the pro-
gram was graphically illustrated by
its effectiveness in foreign lands,
ORINS built a third mobile lab, and
it has traveled the area trom Texas
to Maryland and from Kentucky to
Puerto Rico. Plans are in the mak-
ing now for the building of a second
laboratory to cover a larger area in
the U.S.

Second Va. School

Washington and Lee is the second
school in Virginia to have the mobile
lab. Last year a two-week course
was given at Hampden-Sydney. The
Institute plans the traveling sche-
dule so that no more than one
school in a state may receive the
laboratory once a year.

The course consists of one 90
minute lecture given at 4:30 to 6:00
every day in Reid Hall and two lab
sessions at 10:00 to 12:00 in the
morning and 7:00 to 9:00 in the eve-
ning.

The laboratory which is contained
entirely in the mobile unit has an
almost hospital-like appearance
with well-scrubbed floors, a certain
antiseptic smell, and a crowded but
organized atmosphere. The forward
portion of the van contains the
radioactive counting room. There
are three identical setups along one
counter which will accommodate
six people. Each setup contains a

Geiger counter and a scintillation
spectrometer. The counts taken
from the samples put into the

counters are read off of a compli-
cated looking bevy of instruments.

 

 

All of the instruments in the mobile
lab are standard equipment, basical-
ly the same that is found at ORINS.
In a second section the space is
taken up by three radiochemical
fume hoods, a Geiger counter, a ra-
diation storage vault, and other
standard laboratory quipment.

Since this program is the only one
of its kind in the United States, the
man who was chosen to conduct
the program throughout the operat-
ing area is of a special breed. Mr.

Leaf Raker Uncovers Plot
To Tamper With IBM

BY THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Well, Openings is definitely closed.

I guess since it has been shut up*
tight for two days, everybody has
gotten together to
tell of all the he-
roic, chivalric
deeds performed
in defense of
nothing, and also
sung the praises of
all the tunes of
glory performed
in bigger - than -
life realism with
much more noise
than juke-boxes
ever make. So, I
won't fool around with Openings.

Instead, I think it fitting to re-|
veal a plot which was afoot to take
over W&L and use it as a head-
quarters to abolish the House Un-
American Activities Committee. But

would have been thoroughly and |}
summarily executed, and all the!

conservatives would have been forc-
ed to wear their old Brooks Brothers
pink shirts and read the Wash-
ington Post editorials about “Oper-
ation Abolition.”

The raker, j.g., a transient from
Snide, Nevada, noticed for some
time that there was always a big
crowd of guys in trench-coats down
by the bridge at night. Remembering
his scout oath of loyalty to em-
ployer, this anonymous hero (who
must go unnamed for obvious rea-
sons) questioned one of the sinis-
ter figures about the cases of trans-
istors that their imported African
warriors kept carrying into a big |

 

 

camouflaged cave in the side of the
hill.

The sinister figure calmly an-
swered that the boys were IBM
repairmen, and that they always
came to fix the machine in the
dead of night.

Our hero made a simple deduc-
tion from this revelation (It’s not
the dead of night now,” he thought
cleverly), and immediately called
the proctor who sneaked out of the
concert, chopped up the transistor
cases, and saved us all last week,

“They need more supervision. I
feel that two chaperones should be
present at every party. (All right.
As long as we pick the chaperones.)

“The Sem motto is ‘Never believe
a W&L boy.” (Take a Bible with
you.)

“They drive too fast on the way
back.” (And who’s trying to beat
the deadline?)

“They are always trying to take
advantage of you.”

“The longer they stay at W&L the
more conceited they get.”

“A few are drunken idiots who
seem to have forgotten their man-
ners.”

On the slim ‘for’ side were:

“I think they are a fine group
of Southern gentlemen. (Wonder
who she’s pinned to?)

“Wild but I like their parties.”
(A freeloader.)

“I never know how to feel when
I'm with a W&L man. They’ll all

Ages!)

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s Un-

| touchables cut down another gangs-
, ter mob Saturday.

The victim — Randolph-Macon —
was doomed from the very start as

| the Untouchables steathily stalked to
' a 43-0 decision.

But exciting heroics were pro-
vided by W&L’s untouchable de
fense, not by its massive offensive
machine.

The shutout was the defensive
unit’s second straight and fourth in
its last five games over a two-year
span. In W&L’s last 12 games the
most points scored by an oppenent is
eight by Johns Hopkins and Se-
wanee,

Not once did the Yellow Jackets

THEY LIKED THE SHOW—A large Homecoming crowd
looks on as W&L’s unbeaten Generals exhibit peak form
Saturday, mauling Randolph-Macon 43-0.

 

North Carolina Whips Booters, 4-1,
N. GC. State Team Edges

The University of North Carolina
and N. C. State stopped the W&L
booters cold on their two-day trip
last week.

The Tar Heels bounced W&L, 4-1,
Wednesday and the Wolfpack added
a 1-0 licking Thursday.

In the UNC contest W&L had a
difficult time in setting up plays.
The Tar Heels took advantage of
this confusion to pump home the
first goal early in the first period.

A penalty kick put Carolina ahead,
2-0, at the end of the first period,

 

Shank Shatters Course Record;
W&L 2nd In 3-Way X-C Meet

A record-breaking performance by
Mike Shank wasn’t enough to off-
set a balanced bunch of Bridgewater
runners in Saturday’s triangular
cross-country meet here.

 

Sports Star Of The Week

Week’s Award
Goes To Shank,
X-C Co-Capt.

Cross-country is as rugged and
grueling a sport as there is today,
yet its participants seldom receive
their just recognition.

There is one member of the Wash-
ington and Lee squad, however, who
rates the distinction of being our
Sports Star of the Week. Mike
Shank a SPE junior from Philadel-
phia, set a course record of 24:20
in a triangular meet against Lynch-
burg College and Bridgewater last
Saturday.

Trimming 1:30 seconds off the
previous record, “Ironhorse” as
Coach Dick Miller has tabbed
Shank, is co-captain of the team,

Shank is also a standout long
and middle distance man on Coach
Norm Lord’s undefeated track team.

 

“Besides being the best runner
on our squad,” Miller said, “Mike’s
attitude is such that it instills
everybody on the team with a de-
sire to win regardless of the op-
ponent.”

Shank, who has been a star among
the harriers since his freshman year,
is an officer of his fraternity and
is a member of the University Chris-
tian Association.

Shank, the Generals’ top runner
this year, captured first place but
Bridgewater copped the next five
finishing positions, winning the
meet with a low total of 21 points.
W&L was second with 52, while
Lynchburg’s 56-point total placed
them third.

Shank covered the 4.1 mile lo-
cal course in 14:20, the lowest time
ever posted by any runner since
the route was revamped recently.

Mac Brownlee was Washington
and Lee’s second best scorer, plac-
ing sixth in 25:47. Rick Rogers was
twelfth, Norm Youngblood  six-
tenth and Andy Kilpatrick eigh-
teenth for the Generals.

Richmond Next

The combination win over Lynch-
burg and loss to Bridgewater gave
the Generals a 4-2 won-lost slate
for the season. They will meet Rich-
mond a week from Saturday in their
next outing.

Coach Dick Miller was satisfied} @

with the performances of Shank
and Brownlee and said he expected
another credible performance against
Richmond.

Generals, 1-0

but a goal by center forward Dave
Knight pushed the Generals back
into the game. Another penalty kick
and a well executed indirect kick
added two more tallies for the Tar
Heels and iced the game for Caro-
lina.

At North Carolina State, the Gen-
erals ran into their problem of not
being able to finish off their plays
in front of the goal. This lack of
finesse resulted in the W&L booters
taking an incredible 46 shots with-
out a single score.

The Generals dominated play, con-
trolling the ball in the Wolfpack half
of the field all afternoon, but a
State penalty kick was enough to
give them a 1-0 win.

Coach Lyles in commenting on
the two games feels that W&L play-
ed well against the Tar Heels, but
were a bit outclassed as far as ex-
perience goes. With both Jim Stark-
ey and Tom Clements out with in-
juries, there is a lack of stability
and experienced players.

The booters play Lynchburg Col-
lege today in Lynchburg and will
meet Duke on Wilson Field this
Thursday.

25-yard line. In fact, only on one

‘ occasion did the ‘Jackets get beyond
. the W&L 40.

Led by linebacker Terry Fohs,
and guards Tommy Goodwin and
Bob Payne, the W&L defense
completely smothered the Ran-
dolph-Macon ground attack. The
‘Jackets turned to the airways, and

* completed as many passes to W&L
defenders as to their own men.

Randolph-Macon attempted 26
aerials, completed seven, and had
five intercepted.

Fohs, Stu Yoffe, and Brice Gam-
ber picked off one R-M pass apiece
while Robin Wood intercepted two
‘Jacket passes.

Yoffe’s interception was one of
the game highlights. The sophomore
halfback leaped high with both
arms extended to snag Lee Krost’s
aerial.

Capitalizing on four breaks,
Washington and Lee breezed to a
28-0 halftime lead. Their longest
drive was 44 yards. Their shortest,
two yards.

Six backs shared the scoring hon-
ors for the Generals; but only one—
quarterback Chuck Lane—had a
hand in two touchdown plays.

The junior signal-caller tossed a
15-yard pass to fullback Doug Mar-
tin in the second period and boot-
legged 10 yards down the left side-
line for the fifth W&L score in the
third period. His run climaxed the

TEST

Generals’ longest drive of the game—
an 81-yard march which required 19
plays.

With only 2:50 gone in the first
period, W&L had an 8-0 lead. Ten
minutes later its margin had
mushroomed to 21-0.

Randolph-Macon’s Victor Sakel-
larios handed the Generals their first
scoring opportunity when he fum-
bled the opening kickoff. Goodwin

W&L end Dan Blain had a hand in

touchdown. He put R-M on its own

rolled dead on the one-inch line.

It was just before the half that

Two plays were necessary for the
six points. Fullback Tommy Keesee

Lane fired to Martin for the tally.

THE DATING SEASON

I have recently returned from a tour of 950,000 American col-
leges where I made a survey of undergraduate dating customs
and sold mechanical dogs, and I have tabulated my findings
and I am now prepared to tell you the simple secret of successful
dating.

The simple secret is simply this: a date is successful when the
man knows how to treat the girl.

And how does a girl like to be treated? If you want to know,
read and remember these four cardinal rules of dating:

1. A girl likes to be treated with respect.

When you call for your girl, do not drive up in front of the
sorority house and yell, ‘Hey, fat lady!’ Get out of your car.
Walk respectfully to the door. Knock respectfully. When your
girl comes out, tug your forelock and say respectfully, ‘“Good
evening, your honor.’’ Then offer her a Marlboro, for what
greater respect can you show your girl than to offer Marlboro
with its fine flavor and exclusive selectrate filter? It will in-
dicate immediately that you respect her taste, respect her dis-
cernment, respect her intelligence. So, good buddies, before
going out on a date, always remember to buy some Marlboros,
available in soft pack or flip-top box in all 50 of the United
States and also Cleveland.

   

“téen to te Paes

2. A girl likes a good listener.

 

SJ btn likes to

Do not monopolize the conversation. Let her talk while you
listen attentively. Make sure, however, that she is not herself
a good listener. I recollect a date I had once with a coed named
Greensleeves Sigafoos, a lovely girl, but unfortunately a listener,

not a talker. I too was a listener so we just sat all night long,
each with his hand cupped over his ear, straining to catch a
word, not talking hour after hour until finally a policeman came
by and arrested us both for vagrancy. I did a year and a day.
She got by with a suspended sentence because she was the sole
support of her aged housemother.

3. A girl likes to be taken to nice places.

By “nice” places I do not mean expensive places. A girl does
not demand luxury. All she asks is a place that is pleasant and
gracious. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, for example. Or
Mount Rushmore. Or the Taj Mahal. Or the Bureau of Weights
and Measures. Find places like these to take your girl. In no
circumstances must you take her to an oil-cracking plant.

4. A girl likes a man to be well-informed.

Come prepared with a few interesting facts that you can drop
casually into the conversation. Like this: “Did you know,

Snookiepuss, that when cattle, sheep, camels, goats, antelopes,
and other members of the cud-chewing family get up, they al-
ways get up hind legs first?” Or this: “Are you aware, Hotlips,

that corn grows faster at night?” Or this: “By the way, Lover-
head, Oslo did not become the capital of Norway till July 11,

1924.”

If you can slip enough of these nuggets into the conversation
before dinner, your date will grow too torpid to eat. Some men
save up to a half million dollars a year this way.

Conservatives To Sponsor Film

The newly-formed Conservative
Society of Washington and Lee will
sponsor the screening of the highly-
controversial film “Operation Aboli-
tion” this evening at 7:30 in duPont
Auditorium.

The guest speaker will be Robert
Goldsboro, a former investigator
for the House Committee on Un-
American Activities. Goldsboro, who
is replacing William Cotter, the
original speaker, will give the short
talk preceding the film and answer
questions afterwards.

The film itself is a 45-minute doc-
umentary showing demonstrations
against a House Un-American Activ-
ities subcommittee in San Francsico
in May of 1960. Narrated by Ful-
ton Lewis, III, well-known news
commentator, the film has been seen
by over 25 million people since it
was released in July of 1960. The
original film was made by camer-
men for television stations in and
around San Francisco.

Realizing the educational bene-
fits of the film, the film was sub-
poenaed with no resulting objections
from the television stations, and was
copied by Video Productions Incor-
porated, of Washington for the House

done in such a cloak and dagger
way was not so overtly subversive
as it might appear.

What those sneaks were really
going to do was replace key parts
in the machine with a plan in mind.

All the D’s in French were go-
ing to be B-, and all the C’s in
Organic would go to D’s. The outs
would be in, the ins would be out,
since it was to happen on a Satur-
day everyone neither in nor out
would be left in limbo permanent-
ly.

As the initial shock wore off, and
party lines were reformed, continual
harassment would have been kept
up. One especially clever plan was
to switch everyone’s major to Amer-
ican History, and force everyone to
take Marriage and the Family at
8:25, TTS.

When their plans were complete
the band of cutthroats planned to
link our machine with others, but
thanks to the alertness, fast-thinking
and acting of an ordinary nameless
citizen, we’re still safe, and the IBM
machine is just peacefully eating
punched cards, unaware of what
foul ends it might have had to
satisfy in the line of duty.

Much emotional controversy has
developed in the nation since the
first showing of the film. The film
has been called a biased attempt by
the House Committee to justify their
job in defending America against in-
ternal Communist subversion. In
defense of the film, its supporters
have stated that it should be rec-
ognized as real proof of the exist-
ence of subversion, and that the
American people should awaken to
the challenge therein exposed.

likes to more modestly think of him-
self as a general handyman whose
duties include everything from driv-
er to electronic technician and from
janitor to laboratory instructor.
With a wife and family at home
Mr. Stone is on the road a good por-
tion of the time. In reply to why he
took the job Mr. Stone said that
“he was the only one fool enough to
volunteer.”

While Mr. Stone operates the lab-
oratory, the lecture sections are
conducted by instructors brought
here from other institutions. The
physics portion of the course, which
will take up the first week, will be
conducted by Dr. William K. Rob-
inson from St. Lawrence University.
The second week Dr. E. K. Ezell
from ORINS will conduct the bio-
chemical series of lectures. While
the laboratory sections are restrict-
ed to the teachers and special stu-
dents taking the course, the lectures
are open to the public.

As Mr. Stone explained, the lab-
oratory program affords the oppor-
tunity to smaller colleges and uni-
versities to work with equipment
and radioactive materials that are
too expensive to obtain or for which
there is no special training. In this
way knowledge of the handling of
radioactive materials, can be spread
to a larger area with the mobile unit.
This essentially, then, is one more
program financed by the government
and directéd by an agency of the
government to upgrade the quality
of educational institutions.

A pair of long marches netted
the Generals their final scores.

sneak climaxed a 43-yard march in
the fourth period.

Washington and Lee completely

statistics, grinding out 340 yards to-
tal offense to R-M’s 122.

The Air Force needs college trained men and women

technology that goes with hypersonic air and space
flight. Your four years of college have equipped you

Say I was interested... how can I get to be an officer?

You know about Air Force ROTC and the Air Force
Academy. Then there’s the navigator training pro-
gram. You’ve probably heard about Officer Training
School...where the Air Force takes certain college
graduates, both men and women, and commissions
them after three months of training.

Starting salary is important. What about that?

Add it up. Base pay, tax-free allowances, free medi-
cal and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps
flight pay. You don’t have to be an eco major to see
it adds up to an attractive package.

I’ve been thinking about getting my Master’s,

As an officer you can apply for the Air Force Institute
of Technology. At no cost, and while on active duty
some officers may even win their Ph.D. degrees.

That’s the job of your local Air Force Recruiter.
