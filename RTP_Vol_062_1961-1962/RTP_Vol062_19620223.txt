Labor vs. Management

Should Anti-Trust Laws
Apply To Labor Untons?
Good Case For Both Sides

(The following report is taken from the research of the highly-
rated W&L debate team, and describes the procedure and arguments
of a formal debate on the subject of labor anti-trust action.)

By STEVE SMITH
News Editor

During 1961-62, college debaters are arguing the question, Resolved:
That labor organizations should be under the jurisdiction of antitrust leg-
islation.

At first glance this question appears to be weighted affirmatively, in
view of the continually increasing power and much-publicized offenses of
labor unions. However, a second examination will
reveal that the question is very evenly balanced and
that neither negative nor affirmative arguments pos-
sess an inherent edge.

The affirmative debaters must prove that there is
intrinsic evil in today’s labor-management relations;
they must present a plan of antitrust legislation which
will remove the evil; and they must prove that their
plan is the best possible solution. If the negative team
can neutralize any one of these three affirmative pre-
sentations, it will probably win the debate.

In proving a need for antitrust legislation, the first
affirmative speaker in a debate has at his command a
tremendous variety of contentions. He can draw from
such union malpractices as price fixing, featherbedding, technological re-
striction (banning of labor-saving devices), restriction of sub-contract-
ing (to “undesirable” employers).

He could also use the argument of union power as the result of in-
dustry-wide bargaining, pointing to ensuing wage-spiral inflation. Unions
have been able to dictate to their employers in the choice of customers,
territory of operation, and in many ways to enter into the product market.

The Inherent Evils Of The Status Quo

By a liberal use of examples the first affirmative concludes that the
status quo is plagued with inherent evils. These examples might include
instances of union picketing, boycotts, or strike power, as well as the above
malpractices. Statistics are available to prove almost any given situation
exists.

The first negative debater must attempt to prove that the status quo is
free of inherent evil, although he is usually willing to concede that unions
have stepped out of line in a few cases. These wrongs, he says, can be
corrected by a means other than antitrust legislation.

This speaker handles much of the affirmative evidence in an unfriendly
manner, claiming that the examples cited were atypical and unrepresen-
tative of the entire labor field. He should be able to present examples
proving the opposite of whatever the affirmative has said to be true.

Affirmative complaints of union strike power he places in the category
of labor disputes; a labor dispute is free from antitrust prosecution, and to
weaken unions in their power to bargain is to threaten their existence.
Moreover, in the labor market the unions must have a monopoly in order
to represent their members to the huge corporations.

Whereas the affirmative has just said that unions are growing more
powerful, the negative now comes up with the fact that union member-
ship is dropping. Also, unions are being successfully prosecuted at the
state level under state antitrust law, so it would be useless to pass more
laws; all that is necessary is enforcement of all the existing statutes.

The second affirmative speaker must establish the plan of antitrust
legislation, which usually consists of amendment of the Sherman and Clay-
ton Acts to allow unions to be prosecuted under these laws. He reviews
the arguments of his colleague and attempt to illustrate that his plan will
solve in every way the problems listed.

Since this usually does not consume a great deal of time, this speaker
is likely to recall and analyze all arguments thus far, showing those of the
affirmative in a favorable light. To counter the negative contention that
strikes involve labor disputes and take place only in the labor market, he
brings up their overwhelming effects in the product market, and says that
because of the cause-and-effect relationship of product and labor markets,
the labor market cannot be treated entirely separately.

Regarding the negative statement that union membership is waning,
he speaks of their increased organization, wealth, and political ascendency.

A Plan To Destroy Labor Unions

In the last constructive presentation of the debate, the second negative
speaker claims that the plan of his opponents will actually destroy unions,
while it is unnecessary in the first place. However, he also claims that the
plan could not possibly work.

All cracks in the affirmative machine are pointed out and widened.
The latest labor laws may outlaw some of the situations provided for in
the plan. The second negative will define antitrust laws in a way which
indicates that they logically have no right to be imposed over the labor
market; he rigidly separates the labor and product markets.

In the rebuttals no major new points are introduced. Each speaker
rises to make his case clear, destroying his opponents’ objections and
giving evidence to prove his contentions. The continued use of statistics
from varied sources to prove conflicting points complicates the arguments.

To debate this topic successfully against a strong team requires a
grasp of the concepts of monopoly, restriction of trade, labor and product
markets, and legal jurisdictions over labor.

The topic was picked by the debate coaches of the United States in a
poll during summer of last year.

Conservative Society To Present
Commandant Weaver on Tuesday

By MALCOLM MORRIS

John O. Weaver, former comman-
dant of the Army’s Psychological
Warefare School, will appear Tues-
day at Washington and Lee.

The assistant to the president of
Communique magazine will speak at
7:15 p.m. in duPont Auditorium. He
will speak on “Semantics as a Com-
munist Weapon.” His appearance is
under the sponsorship of Washington
and Lee’s Conservative Society. The
society, an independent group, was
formed last spring by a group of
students and townspeople.

 

Alumnus Praises

Hell Week Ban

The following was written by a
Washington and Lee alumnus and
former president of PiKA. It is in
response to the recent Hell Week
controversy which resulted in the
abolishment of Hell Week by three
fraternities, of which PiKA was
one.

Excerpts from the letter, writ-
ten to a PiKA freshman, follow.
They consist of this man’s view on
Hell Week and the essense of
what a fraternity can and should
be.

Hell Week was an anachronism; it
was a sort of medieval institution
that should have been abolished long
ago. I gave half a try to do this when
I was a freshman and I failed. I’m
glad that you succeeded.

The idea that Hell Week served
a character building purpose is re-
lated to the barbaric belief that a
man should be made to suffer some-
times to teach him how to “take it.”
This is ridiculous. Human degrada-
tion seldom serves a_ constructive
purpose, and in this case it didn’t.

The other justification for Hell
Week, that it produces class soli-
darity and spirit, is also absurd. Just
about the only thing it ever did was
to create animosity and an infantile
wish to do the same thing to the
following class simply because you
had to go through it. Could any-
thing be more stupid or less manly?

The important think now is your
attitude toward the house, toward
the brothers, and toward future
change. You have gotten rid of a
perverted tradition that wasn’t
worth keeping—this was a definite
good. However, I hope that you will
be careful of what you do in the

Weaver, former special assistant to
the Chief of Information of the U.S.
Army, is a graduate of Northwestern
University and is an ordained Epis-
copal minister.

Communique is a new magazine
published by Communique—The
Cold War Digest, Inc. The magazine
is scheduled to bring out its first
edition later this year.

Weaver served with the Midwest
Division of CBS as news editor and
director of special events from 1936
to 1941. During World War II, he
was a propaganda officer for the
U.S. Army.

From 1950 to 1952, Weaver was
commandant of the Psychological
Warfare School at Fort Riley, Kan.

Don Huffman, co-program chair-
man for the society, stated that
Weaver was not representing any
political group or _ organization.
Weaver spoke last November at the
State Junior Chamber of Commerce
Convention at Natural Bridge.

Brent Arthur, president of the
Conservative Society, said “seman-
tics is a subject very little under-
stood. It involves the double mean-
ings in words. The word ‘peace’ to
communists may mean something
entirely different from our concept
of peace because of semantics.”

 

Civil War Roundtable

W&L Civil War Roundtable is
scheduled to meet at 7:15 p.m. Mon-
day in the Student Union Building
to discuss the Civil War career of
Union General Benjamin F. Butler.

Professors Defend Petition’s

Request For Sophomore Rush

By LARRY MEEKS

“We want to interest the freshmen in the academic side of
the University. We feel that too much emphasis is being placed

74% on the social. This is not a move to try to stifle the fraternities

but a move to create a better University environment,” ex-
plained Dr. E. W. Spencer when asked about the recent faculty
petition concerning the fraternity activities.

 

Wild Beer Bout
Staged At LSU

From the Shreveport Journal

BATON ROUGE, Feb 15— Louis-
iana State University today placed
two fraternities on probation for
staging a beer drinking contest last
weekend.

The Interfraternity Council ord-
ered Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon placed on probation for
staging the contest at a local bar. It
began at noon Saturday and ended
at midnight.

Midway through the bout, an ob-
server reported to a newspaper that
one fraternity was leading, 136 cases
to 132, but, the newspaper reported
he seemed hazy about which fra-
ternity was in the lead. There was
no official score at the end of the
bout.

The Choir will play three selec-
tions for the program: “Canzona No.
4,” Babrieli; “Fantasy on Old Hun-
dredth,” Purcell; and a short piece
“Divertissement,” written especially
for the group by their director, Rob-
ert Stewart.

The program moderated by Ann

Alexandria will speak here Wednes-

day.
Dr. Albert T. Mollegen, who
teaches New Testament language

and literature at the seminary, will
talk at 8:15 p.m. in Lee Chapel. He
will discuss “Albert Camus: Facing

is open to the public.

Noted as an apologist for classical
Christianity to modern intellectuals,
Dr. Mollegen is an ordained Episco-

of the South.

Dr. Mollegen currently is study-
ing the relationship between so-
ciology and religion. He has con-
tributed to The Theology of Paul
Tillich, Socialism and American Life,
A Companion to the Study of St.
Augustine, Dr. Lowrie of Princeton
and Rome, Preaching the Christian
Year and Christianity and Youth

He has lectured at several semi-

future. There are many good and
positive traditions that have been
given up and forgotten in fratern-
ities. Why don’t you survey them,
dust them off, and do a double good
by bringing back what is really
worth keeping?

A fraternity can quite easily de-
generate into an eating club, or into
a loose group of people who just
get used to and can just barely tol-

* Dr. Spencer was one of those in-

strumental in drawing up the pe-
tition. He is well qualified to speak
on the subject as he attended W&L
as an undegraduate and was presi-
dent of his social fraternity.

Concerning the possibility of IFC
action he said, “The IFC has always
acted in what they considered best
for the fraternities. The faculty must
look at what is best for the Univer-
sity as a whole. The faculty would
probably have to take action, but
I think it would be marvelous if the
IFC would do it.”

Trends Toward Reform?

When asked if he thought that
there was already a trend towards
reform, he answered, “My pledge
class rebeled when I was a pledge.
That’s when the KA’s initiated Hell
Week. Some other changes have
also been made such as prohibiting
paddling. The trend is a good one,
but it does not solve all the prob-
lems.”

Dr. Spencer favors moving pledg-
ing to the beginning of the sopho-
more year and initiation to the be-
ginning of the second semester of
that year, believing that “Help Week
will vanish because of the added
maturity of the sophomores.”

Dr. L. R. Emmons was also a lead-
er in drawing up the petition. He
said that he was disappointed in his
students during Hell Week, but he
quickly added that it hasn’t been
just Hell Week. In his words, “It
started back at the first of the se-
mester and only reached a cres-
cendo during Hell Week. I might as
well not have held classes during
that week.”

First Two Weeks “Wasted”

He said that the following week
was also wasted as the students
were “recuperating.” He believes, as
Dr. Spencer does, that “too much
emphasis is placed on the social life
and not enough on the academic.”

He further believes that under the
sophomore or delayed rush system
the students would be “in a better
position to evaluate the fraternity
system.”

Concerning the petition itself, Dr.
Emmons stated, “The petition was
started and intended only to ques-
tion what was going on. It was only
an inquiry. It was not meant to go
to the IFC at the present time. We
wanted to send it to someone and we
didn’t know who. We didn’t expect
all this publicity. In fact, we haven’t
even made a whole-hearted effort
to go out and secure signatures from
all the faculty.

“It is only an introduction to
thought. I still believe in it and hope
that something is done. These are
‘our’ thoughts. I’m not sure that all
the signers endorsed all of these
things; people just favored some
type of reform.”

He believes that by having rush
in the sophomore year, a student
would have a year to look over the
fraternities and see the good points
and bad points of each, and can
make a proper evaluation.

Freshmen “Pushed”

Dr. Emmons feels that by having
rush week during the first week of

the freshman year, the freshmen
are pushed into the fraternities
without having time to evaluate and
decide whether or not he wants to
join a fraternity. He stated that
with 80 per cent of the freshmen
class pledging, a new student feels
that he must join a fraternity in

order to have any fun. Emmons fav-
ors social activities directed by the
administration during the freshman
year. Under that system, according
to him, “The freshman class would

The Faculty Petition

We are puzzled and disappointed by the tone and content
of the petition by some faculty members to put rush week off
to the sophomore year. It seems to us to be one of the most
negative and ill-considered movements to arise on the hill in

some time.

Let’s take a look at the supposed values of a second-year

rush, as listed by the petition:

1. It would allow freshmen to adapt themselves to the
University environment without undue social pressure.

Undue social pressure does not have a great deal to do with
fraternities or early rush. Look at Princeton, for example, or
U.Va. Translated, this argument means “Freshmen would
study more if there weren’t a bunch of fraternity men drag-
ging them down the road against their will.” That’s just wish-
ful thinking. Fraternities can, and do, encourage their fresh-

men to study.

2. It would eliminated the academic loss of the first
week of the second semester of the freshman year.

And lose a week sometime in the first semester of the soph-
omore year. We think Hell Week should be abolished or dras-
tically cut, but this is a problem which is not too closely tied
to rush. If anyone thinks that sophomores won’t put up with
it, witness the stuff they used to put up with for PAN and
White Friars until those two erstwhile organizations met an un-

timely end.

3. It would allow time for a proper evaluation by both
fraternities and prospective members.

A more thorough evaluation does seem to us to be de-
sirable. On the other hand, we feel that the advantages of get-
ting rush out of the way early and removing the pressure for all
concerned, together with the advantages of a longer close asso-
ciation with upperclassmen, outweigh the advantages of a long-

er period before rush.

4. It would strengthen class ties and develop a sense

of pride in the University.

It certainly would strengthen class ties—at the expense

of ties among the classes.

In what way will a later rush develop a sense of pride in
the University, though? Washington and Lee men are as
proud of their university as any other college men we know.
This point needs some explication.

5. It would eliminate the stigma attached to non-fra-

ternity students.

Really? We count many friends among the non-fraternity
students. The supporters of the faculty petition would be in-
terested to find that the non-fraternity men are considered on
the whole to be a better group than two or three of the fra-
ternities. They also might consider that the stigma attached to
some non-fraternity men usually stems from the elements of
their character that prevented them from making a fraternity
rather than from the fact they are NFU’s.

We think that the questions of rush and of Hell Week
deserves a full disccussion. The present petition contributes
nothing to the discussion, however. A close study of the pro-
visions reveals the recurrent attitude of a faculty minority who
tend to blame the fraternities for all the ills of the University.

It just ain’t so.

An Interview With Dean Williams...

 

A Challenge To Fraternities:
Continue Positive Contributions

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Perhaps if any single phrase most
adequately describes Washington
and Lee University, that phrase
would be “rich in tradition.” The
Honor System, conventional dress,
beer at Goshen—these are the things
that have for decades been an in-
tegral part of student life at W&L.
The tradition that has possibly play-
ed the biggest role in creating the
complexion of this university is the
social fraternity. For approximately
100 years, the nucleus of extra-cur-
ricular life has been the various
closely-knit Greek letter societies of
brotherhood.

Dr. Clayton Epes Williams, Dis-

LETTERS

TO THE |».
Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir: I think all of us at Wash-

ington and Lee realize that our cam-
pus and many of the customs and
traditions that have long been as-
sociated with it are in a period of
re-evaluation and_ transformation.
With almost every issue of the Ring-
tum Phi we read of change in cur-
riculum, Hell Week, student gov-
ernment, social life, ete—the list is
endless. Doubtless, in the over-
whelming number of cases, changes
were needed, and genuine progress
resulted from them.

Nevertheless, in our zeal to im-
prove the University we must be
careful to temper change with good
sense. Those faculty members who
are now advocating the moving of
rush to the sophomore year have
not done this.

Obviously the professors who first
instigated the petition realized that
three hundred sophomores could not
find rooms in Lexington without the
fraternities, and he knew that intra-
murals and social life would be
practically non-existent, but he also
believed that by asking for more
than he wanted, a better bargain
could be driven with the IFC.

This, I submit, is not the proper
procedure for eliminating Help
Week or for changing the rushing
procedure. As long as we do lip
service to Student Government, we
must admit that these certainly are
two areas which must be left en-
tirely in the hands of the students.
If changes are needed, these chang-
es must come from a desire of the
student body, not from faculty pe-
titions.

As we discuss and vote on these
proposals in our various fraternity
meetings, let us do so in a spirit of
doing what is best for the univer-
sity, not in an attempt to appease
the faculty with some small change
which none of us really want.

Very truly yours,
JOHN LACKEY

tinguished Lecturer in the School of
Law, has seen first-hand the influ-
ences wrought on W&L students by
fraternities since 1908. That was
the year Dean Williams came here
as a freshman. Four years later he
graduated from Washington and Lee,
president of Pi Kappa Alpha. He
returned in 1919 after practicing
law for six years and has remained
ever since.

Met in McCrums

In his student days, Dean Wil-
liams recalls that for the most part
fraternities had no houses. Satur-

day nights were meeting nights, and |.
the gavels of the various groups]

were sounded in the little rooms
over McCrum’s Drug Store. A few
began to rent houses, but it wasn’t
until around 1930 that the fraterni-
ties began constructing buildings ex-
plicitly for their purposes.

Membership then averaged 20-25 :

men per house. This was due, ac-

cording to Dean Williams, in part to | ‘

the smaller student body. “I would
suppose also,” he said, “that the in-
creased membership today is oc-
casioned partly as a means of fi-
nancing the houses.”

Rush in Dean Williams’ day was
different, too. “Then,” he said, “it
wasn’t as organized as now. We just
stuck a button on a boy and he
was a pledge.” Nor did the institu-
tion of Hell Week prevail then, al-
though on the night of initiation

  

 

pledges “got the dickens beat out
of them.”

Unwise To Abolish Fraternities

Today, there seems to be a definite
and growing sentiment, especially

 

Dean Williams
Should fraternities be abolished?

among faculty members, for the
abolishment of fraternities at W&L.
How does Dean Williams feel about
this—both as a fraternity man and
a faculty member of Washington
and Lee?

tionally beeen a strong fraternity

‘Living’ And ‘Acting’ Are Same;

Democracy Here

By HOWARD SLATER

There are, no doubt, some
thoughtful individuals who have
asked themselves why anyone would
want to write a column for this
newspaper. They’ve hit upon a good
question. I often ask myself the
same thing; because I know, as they
know, that there must be very few
people who take the trouble to read
this, much less be influenced by
what I have to say.

But there is a reason, as far as
I am concerned anyway, and it’s this:
Even though people may not read
or be provoked into thought by what
is written here each week, an at-
tempt has nevertheless been made
to state what (it is hoped) are
worthwhile thoughts. The moving
forces in life cannot depend for
stimulation on calculations of prob-
able results. That would be a low
way to live.

A Will for Action

Instead, life ought to be motivat-
ed by a will for action, by a belief
that living and acting are synono-
mous terms, and that a life devoid
of acts—stemming from the assump-
tion that nothing can be done to
achieve one’s desired ends—is no
life at all. When we say that the
important thing is “not whether you
won or lost, but how you played the

 

Is Worth A Try

game,” isn’t that a variation on the
same theme?

And to those who contend that
winning, in the broadest sense, is
possible—I say to them that this is
irrelevant. Our greatest tragedians—
the men most sensitive in secular
society to the destinies of other men
—all reader the verdict that men
must inevitably lose in the battle
that is life. And yet, the point for
their texts, Sophocles, Shakespeare,
et al., is always that acting in the
face of such a verdict is what makes
men noble and gives meaning to
their lives.

This is the philosophy to which
this column owes its existence. It
seems to me that this reasoning ap-
plies equally as well to student gov-
ernment at Washington and Lee.
This philosophy comes into direct
conflict with the editorials appearing
this past week in other editions of
the Ring-tum Phi; and for this rea-
son, I reject the conclusion stated
therein.

Now, For That Editorial...

It is true, as the editorials pointed
out, that we do not have a demo-
cratically functioning student gov-
ernment. In fact, it may be closer
to the truth to say that there is

Censor Board
Puts Taboo

On “No Sun”

By STEVE HENRY

The scene: a local art (?) theatre
where a small crowd sits, idly
stomping mice and waiting for the
feature to begin.

Lo and behold. It begins. The
name of the movie is “No Sun In
Venice,” a_ peculiarly lethargic
French flick with music by the
Modern Jazz Quartet.

It isn’t anything special, but the
crowd sits patiently, trying to read
the subtitles that usually appear be-
low the screen.

All is calm.

Unknown to the viewers, however,
a major crisis is arising in the dark
recesses of the manager’s office.

A phone call creates the crisis.
Or we should say a series of urgent
phone calls, all of utmost importance
to the public.

On one end of the line is a rep-
resentative of that admirable group,
the Maryland Board of Censors.

His message is quick, concise
meaningful, and to the point: he
tells the manager that his theatre
has received an uncensored version
of “No Sun in Venice.”

Oh, horrors! The sancity of the
town of Lexington has been threat-
ened. What to do? What to do?

The Maryland board gives the
manager two alternatives: cut out
two particularly objectionable scenes
in the flick, or return the film to
Baltimore, muy pronto.

It is a crisis of staggering pro-
portions, and the manager reacts as
any normal person would under
such pressure and strain: he panics.

(A word here about the scenes
that must be removed from the
movie.)

One, showing a girl pulling a man
down on a bed, is so gross that it
defies description. Why, you could
actually see their heads. Horrors!

The other, showing a girl in a
bathtub, is equally offensive. You
could see her head, too.

But back to the manager, who
faces perhaps the most important
decision of his life.

Rather than attempt to cut out
the scenes himself (Can’t you see the
good manager, scissors in hand, as-
cending those creaky stairs to save
our precious minds from corruption?
The film editors guild cringes at
the thought.), he decides to send the
film back to Baltimore from whence
it came.

His comment on the entire situa-
tion is stoic in tone: “Brother Rat
tonight,” he sighs, thus putting an
end to one of the shortest runs a
movie ever made.

Oh, Virginia. Oh, Maryland, my
Maryland. How good it is to know
that someone is looking after our
interests.

Oh, the ability to make a firm
stand in a crisis. Oh, the saving of
sweet and gentle minds. Oh, censor-
ship, we've lived with you three
years. Without you, our college lives
would be corruption city. Oh,
wonderful. Oh progress, you are
great.

OAS Extremists Lack Supp

By AL BROADDUS

(Editor’s note—This is the sec-
ond article sent us from France by
Al Broaddus, a 1961 W&L gradu-
ate who is studying at the Uni-
versity of Strasbourg under a Ful-
bright grant. He discusses the Al-
gerian question this week.)

The most pressing French political
issue, as everyone knows, is Algeria.
There is no need to repeat here what
has already been said in numerous
books and magazines concerning its
historical antecedents, nor the politi-
cal, economic, and social factors
which have made the current Al-
gerian situation. An extremely in-
teresting aspect of this entire ques-
tion, however, has been the reac-
tion to it in metropolitan France.
Here are my impressions:

Everyone wants a solution to Al-
geria, and soon. The question is, of

 

course, which one. The Secret Army
Organization (OAS), under Gen.
Salan, in its determination to keep
Algeria French, has had tremendous
success in at least making it known
that there exists a segment of the
French population who (very decid-
edly) favor the status quo. To a
great extent the OAS is the effective
government of the Europeans in Al-
geria.

But while the attention paid the
OAS by the press may correspond,
generally, to its position in Algeria
itself, certain articles overrate its
influence in metropolitan France.
Conceivably they may even increase
it. The large majority of Frenchmen
in France, it appears to me, are so
weary of Algeria and its drain on
the French nervous, as well as finan-
cial system, that they are willing to
accept the freeing of Algeria at this

 

point, whatever might have been
their sentiments when the question
was initially brought up.

French Reactions to the OAS

The OAS is aware of this pre-
dominant attitude in metropolitan
France, and has set out upon the
enormous task of whipping the en-
tire nation into favoring the reten-
tion of Algeria. It has not succeed-
ed. It never had a chance. What it
has succeeded in creating, however,
is a tense civil situation in France,
an abnormal atmosphere. This is
particularly the case in Paris. The
demonstrations directed by the FLN
there during the month of October
were largely in reaction to the ac-
tivity of the OAS, as have been the
demonstrations of students and oth-
er bodies since then.

Although the OAS has failed in
its fundamental aims in metropoli-

 

tan France. the reaction to its ac-
tivity has been greater, probably,
than the amount of civil unrest
would merit. The government has
taken, as a result, several repressive
measures, in particular effecting the
press. The Atlantic edition of Time
for January 26, running a cover
story on Gen. Salan, was nearly
banned completely, was forced to
blacken its cover. This has probably,
overall, served to weaken the gov-
ernment and DeGaulle in terms of
popular support, since the French
abhor anything that smacks of cen-
sorship. Thus in this respect the
OAS has been indirectly suecessful
in metropolitan France.

Either Sorrow or Disgust
The reaction to Algeria in France
has not been entirely homogenous,
but, comprehensively, it seems to be
one form or another of either sorrow

 

or disgust. It is the OAS which re-
ceives the brunt of this disgust since
it is often the initiating agent, al-
though the reprisals of the FLN
are equally bloody.

Students and intellectuals have
taken a strong stand against the
OAS, and engage in nationwide
demonstrations. Many of them ac-
cuse the police of supporting the
OAS. (A policeman who entered a
student restaurant where I was sit-
ting, apparently without official in-
tention, was bombarded with pieces
of bread.) Although political sen-
timents entirely apart from Algeria
itself are involved in much of the
movement against the OAS, and
this is particularly true of the stu-
dents, most of the motivation is the
result of the bloodshed involved.

The Paradox
Perhaps the greatest paradox of

 

ort In Crisis-Weary France

the Algerian question is that it has
made the general atmosphere here
in France during the last ten years
entirely different from what it
would have been otherwise.

France, a full participant in the
highly successful European Common
Market, has experienced during the
past decade a great economic expan-
sion. France is at this moment fun-
damentally strong and prosperous.
Her greatest internal problem, ag-
riculture, is based on overproduc-
tion. Algeria, because of the politi-
eal issue which has developed
around it, is a dead weight attached
to a nation which without it would
be progressing at an even faster
rate than it is. It is likely that the
people of metropolitan France, real-
izing increasingly, as they are, the
inappropriateness of the problem
at this point in the nation’s history,
will soon divest her of it.
Varsity Footballers Scrimmage Alumni Saturda

Experienced Graduates
Face ’62 Grid Hopefuls

By LANCE TARRANCE
Assistant Sports Editor
The team that will be Washington and Lee football in 1962
gets its first chance to show its style tomorrow afternoon in
varsity-alumni game to be played at Wilson Field. Game time

is 2:45.

 

Cagers Meet
Emory-Henry
On Saturday

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team, after four straight losses on
the road, moves back into cozy
Doremus Gymnasium tomorrow
night for a game with Emory and
Henry.

The Generals, 5-11 for the year,
have picked up all five wins at
home, and coach Bob McHenry is
hoping to make their last home
stand a victory.

Emory and Henry, however, may
have something to say about that.
The Tigers pasted W&L 75-55 in
December, and McHenry called them
“the best Emory and Henry team
in the last four years.”

“They’ve got a real tall bunch
of boys,” said McHenry, “and they’re
improving every game.”

6-12 Overall

The Tigers, with a 6-12 overall
record, depend on the scoring tal-
ents of two good shooters, guard
John Borke and forward Larry
Shelor.

But Emory and Henry is weak
on ball-handling, according to Mc-
Henry, and the Generals will put
special emphasis on defense, hoping
to force the Tigers into offensive
mistakes.

“We'll have to put more pressure
on their guards,” said McHenry. “If
we're behind, we’ll go into that zone
press that’s worked well for us this
year.”

Monier

McHenry will go with his regular
starting line-up, except at center
where Mike Monier will take over
a starting role from Bill Smith.

“We need Mike under the boards.
He'll add height and scoring punch,”
said McHenry.

He added that the Generals “have
been hurting under the boards this
year.”

Other starters will be Bip Fauber
and Bill Ide at the forwards, and
Louie Paterno and Tom Supac at
guards.

The Emory and Henry game will
end Ide’s and Monier’s basketball
careers in Doremus Gymnasium.
Both are seniors and will graduate
in June.

 

Frosh Play Ferrum Here

Washington and Lee’s freshman
basketball team meets Ferrum Jun-
ior College in Doremus Gymnasium
Saturday afternoon. Game time is
4:30.

The Baby Generals are shooting
for their eighth win of the year.
They’ve lost five.

Ferrum crushed the frosh in an
earlier game, but coach Joe Lyles
is hoping that a home court advan-
tage will help out his squad, which
is still playing without the services
of outstanding rebounder and scor-
er, Jerry Kowalski.

Two weeks of relatively good
weather have given head coach Lee
McLaughlin a chance to get his squad
in shape to meet an alumni team
composed almost entirely of gradu-
ating seniors from W&L’s unde-
feated, untied 1961 Generals.

McLaughlin called the alumni “as
tough as any team we'll meet next
year, and probably tougher,” and
he wasn’t kidding.

Who’s Who

The alumni starting line-up reads
like a who’s who of W&L football
for the past two years, both of
which were undefeated ones for the
Generals.

In the backfield for the alumni
will be Robin Wood at quarterback,
Jim Russ at right half, Wayne
Bradshaw at fullback, and Dave
Thorp at left halfback.

Starting 1961 quarterback Steve
Suttle will see action in the back-
field, but McLaughlin says that “we
might just use him anywhere we
need a good man.”

All-American Terry Fohs, Jerry
Hyatt, Fog Budd, and Bill Wheeler
will be the mainstays of the alumni
line.

An assortment of law students,
VMI graduates, and _ loaned-out
tackles from next year’s varsity will
add depth to the alumni team.

But McLaughlin isn’t too concern-
ed with the outcome of tomorrow’s
game.

Good Look

“We just want to get a real good
look at what our boys can do under
game conditions,” he said. “We'll be
playing everybody, especially our
rising sophomores.”

One aspect of his 1962 team, how-
ever, needs no trial under fire and
that’s the backfield.

Even with All-American Charlie
Gummey unable to compete for the
varsity, McLaughlin isn’t hurting for
talent in his backfield.

Four lettermen, including one
starter from the 1961 squad, will
start for the varsity tomorrow.
They’ll be Chuck Lane at quarter-
back, Tommy Keesee at fullback,
Stu Yoffe at right half, and Henry
Sacket at left half.

In the line for the varsity, Mc-
Laughlin is sure about his starters
at every position except end, where
he has four boys who'll see lots
of action.

Buck Ogilive, John Madison, Mike
Jenkins, and Ed Croft are possible
starters at end for the varsity.

At tackles, it’ll be Bob Payne and
Jim Sylvester, and Mickey Walker
and Joe Houssan will open at guard.
Mike Sheffey will start at center.

The varsity-alumni game
conclude spring practice for the
Generals.

 

Notice

Basketball fans might be interest-
ed in knowing that the Group I-B
high school tournament is currently
being played in the VMI fieldhouse.
Consolation finals and finals are
scheduled tonight, with Waynesboro
meeting Parry McCluer in the
championship game at 9 p.m.

Potent Combination For Alumni—Suttle Hands Off to Russ.

 

Wrestlers Meet Virginia

Monday In

Season Finale

The Washington and Lee wrestling team puts the wraps on
one of its most successful seasons in recent years Monday when
it travels to Charlottesville for a match with the University of

Virginia.

The Generals, now 6-3 for the year, are in good physical

shape for the match against the*

Whaoos, and Coach Dick Miller
thinks chances are good for victory
number seven.

“Tf we can forget the way West
Virginia nicked us,” Miller said, “we
ought to be able to handle them.”

Inconsistent

He added, however, that UVa. has
been inconsistent this year, and
that the Wahoos could be up for
this match, hoping to get back at
the Generals for a 28-0 shut out
handed to them at Lexington last
year.

Miller called Virginia “especially
tough in the 157-pound class.”

The Generals will go with their
regular starting lineup against Vir-
ginia. Butch West and Jud Bab-
cock, both hampered with injuries
during the last two weeks, will be
ready to go.

Mersereau

The Virginia match will close out
the varsity career of W&L senior
co-captain Mersereau.

Mersereau, who has compiled a
5-4 record this year against what
Miller called “extra fine competi-
tion,” is the only starter the Gen-
erals will lose from the 1961-62
squad.

A four-year letterman, Mersereau
has a 26-9-1 record, and Miller

SAE Tops DTD

For BKB Title

SAE overcame an 18-14 halftime
deficit to down the Delts 32-27 and
capture the Intramural Basketball
Crown. Only four players scored
for the victors as they ended the
1961-62 season with an unblemished
record.

Led by the shooting of Doug Mar-
tin, the Delts jumped off to an early
lead and stopped Charlie Savage
and Henry Sackett from doing any
considerable scoring. The quick-
moving Delt zone limited these two
SAE hoopsters to a total of ten
points in the first twenty minutes.

Baskets by Bull Roberts, Sackett,
and Savage tied the score in the
first two minutes of the second half.
After a foul shot by Savage, a jump
shot by Sackett put the SAE’s in
front 23-20. Another hoop by Sackett
gave the winners a lead they never
lost.

Sackett led all scorers with 14
points, while Savage contributed five
baskets and two charity tosses. The

Jackets Clip
W&L, 70-55

Ashland, Feb. 22—Randolph-
Macon’s basketball team took the
lead after six minutes and never
was headed here Thursday night in
a 70-55 victory over Washington and
Lee.

It was the final game of the regu-
lar season for the Yellow Jackets,
who finished with a 16-5 record and
a tie with Norfolk W&M for the
Little Eight championship.

As usual, Al Roberts, with 23
points, and Frank Kaminski, with
19, paced the Randolph-Macon at-
tack. Rodger Fauber led W&L with
15 and Lou Paterno had 11 for the
Generals, now 5-10 over-all.

The Yellow Jackets moved ahead
for keeps at 18-14 after 5:55 of play
and were in front, 32-25, at halftime.
After intermission, the Jackets
steadily pulled away as Roberts
banged in seven of his nine field
goals and Kaminski hit 10 of 13
foul shots down the stretch.

It was 67-47 with 4:14 remaining
and the Jackets coasted in.

Kaminski collected 13 of his 19
points from the free-throw stripe as
W&L fouled repeatedly. Randolph-
Macon converted 26 of 34 charity
toses, the Generals only 13 of 19.

 

Riflemen Manage Split
In Two Dual Matches

Washington and Lee’s rifle team
managed a split in two matches
against major school competition
this week, defeating George Wash-
ington, but losing to Wake Forest.

Freshman John Rosenberg led the
Generals over GW, 1361-1356. He
fired a team high 279 at the VMI
range.

Wake Forest, however, turned
back W&L 1377-1369 in Winston-
Salem. Dave Auld was high for the
Generals with a score of 283.

Abolition of Fraternities Here

Called “Unwise” By Dr. Williams

(Continued from page 2)

school, and they have contributed
a positive good to the life of the
university. I doubt the wisdom of
abolishing them here.

“The reasons for the professors’
objecting to fraternities are, first
of all, because they (the fraternities)
are undemocratic; also they take
some of the loyalties from the school.
This is shown in preference for in-
tramural athletics, etc.”

Discussing these objections, Dean
Williams dwelled for a moment on
the “undemocratic” contention.
“You can’t force social contacts on
a student against his will. If there
were no fraternities, then there
would be clubs of some sort. I
don’t think the student can be
democratic in his personal, intimate
contacts. There has to be some con-
geniality there. On a social level, you
are going to have cleavages as long
as you have people.”

He said, also, that some profes-
sors feel fraternities take away from
academic pursuits. He pointed out
that “without fraternities, some of
this would still happen. Fraternities
hold up, according to him, “pretty
well with non-fraternity averages.”

Commenting on the benefits of
fraternity life, Dean Williams said
the “relationship and fellowship with
the other members’ of _ the
fraternity” is what he _ prizes
about his membership in one
“This kind of situation is more
apt to occur in a fraternity than
out of one.” He added that, while
one goes to college primarily for an

 

Brass Choir to Perform
(Continued from page 1)

Lead male roles will be filled by
John Baker as Black Weaver, Phil
Booth as the Leader and Preacher,
and Scott Iocone as the Father.
Weill also wrote the very successful
“Three Penny Opera.”

The program will include a con-
cert version of “Down in the Valley”
and also selections by the Mary
Baldwin group and the Glee Club.

The Glee Club has added several
news songs to its program for this
concert. Among these are: “Conceit-
ed,” a burlesque, featuring a vocal
quartet with the Glee Club; “Echo
Song,” an antiphonal composition
by di Lasso; and a new quiet ar-
rangement of “Tom Dooley” featur-
ing the Baritone section of the club.

 

education, “the bookworm doesn’t
get the most out of it. He will prob-
ably be working in the back office
for the man out front with the
good personality. Fraternities teach
the social graces, cooperation, etc.
Although I’ve known a few who
haven’t belonged to fraternities, I
think it is true that the majority of
potential campus leaders are fra-
ternity members.”

Asked if he thought fraternities
had done anything over-all detri-
mental to the intellectual life of the
university Dean Williams answered
with a decided “no.” He also dis-
missed the theory that fraternities
contribute to the students’ moral de-
generation. “We have just as high-
moral individuals with them as we
would without.”

On the matter of deferred rush-
ing, Dean Williams feels it would
be better for the rushees and the
houses. Both, he said, make mis-
takes that might be avoided by a
later rush. He added, however, that
“it’s pretty radical to put rushing
off until the sophomore year, and
I don’t think it will go through now.
They have tried to do it a number
of times in the past and haven’t suc-
ceeded.”

Who on the faculty supports the
abolishment of fraternities? Dean
Williams said, “It would be my
guess that it is the younger pro-
fessors instigating the movement. I’m
not sure about general faculty senti-
ment, however.”

“There is a swing of sentiment
against fraternities. If fraternities
want to remain, they have to con-
tribute something positive. Frater-
nities are realizing this, and their
reaction may counterbalance the
sentiment against them. They are
on trial and it is up to them to pro-
duce.”

put up with the abuses of the fra-

Emmons maintains that the
change would only be a burden on
the fraternities for the first year
after it was initiated. In short he
stated that it is time for a re-eval-
uation among the fraternities, and
students, and the faculty as to
whether or not there is undue em-
phasis placed on the social life as
opposed to the academic life.

In an interview on Thursday
morning, Dean Atwood stated that
the petition still hasn’t been official-

When it is received, probably a spe-
cial meeting of the faculty Fraterni-

Slater Speaks Out on Student Government

(Continued from page 2)

hardly any student government at
all; for when we look for it, what
do we find but a few committees
whose sole purpose, apparently, is
to make sure we behave like good
boys—one to keep us from writing
on library walls, one to keep us in
Windsor knots, one to keep us hon-
est, and so on.

In contrast to what is, we need
look no further than the platform of
last year’s successful candidate for
President, to see what could be. Mc-
Thenia proposed that student gov-
ernment could and ought to be the
basis for the establishment of stu-
dent groups with interests in na-

tional politics. Student government | :

condition of student life. There have
been a number of theories about
what caused the political upheaval in
last year’s student elections. I think
that what we saw happening then
was a genuine wave of resentment
against the Establishment, against
shoo-in elections.

That resentment had its effect for
only a little while; there have been
few recent ripples on the calm sur-
fac of our status-quo. But because
that upheaval failed to produce any
significant growth of democracy in
student government, because the
student body once again abdicated
its responsibilities to be coneerned,
and because an attempt to achieve

 

something positive was frustrated—
these are not reasons for contend-
ing that the attempt should not be
made again, and again and again.

It is the attempt which really
counts, in student concerns as well
as all bread of life; not for the sake
of any sacred cow of success, such
as ODK, but because acting—wheth-
er as student leader or student fol-
lower—is what makes life meaning-
ful, anytime, anywhere. Let’s hear
no more about the improbabilities
of student democracy. A democratic
student government—indeed a fun-
ctioning student government—is a
worthwhile goal. The effort should
always be made.

 

could certainly undertake as just] ’ ee

one project a trial debate involving | |
our own debate team. Student in-|*
terest, if stimulated by the kind of |*
publicity which student government |)
could evoke, would probably be as| ':

great as is usually the case when a
school has a winning team. In short,
action by our student government,
be it a democratic or non-democrat-
ic organization, is possible.

Now as for the democracy which
we do not have—it is true that
Washington and Lee, like England,
