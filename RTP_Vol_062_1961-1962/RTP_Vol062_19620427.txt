English Department | Announces
Chairman After Extended Search

The appointment of a new head of
the Department of English and three
other faculty additions were an-
nounced today by Dean William
Pusey.

Dr. Severn Parker Costin Duvall,
currently associate professor of Eng-
lish at Dartmouth College, will be-
come professor of English and head
of Washington and Lee’s English
program in September.

Other faculty appointments an-
nounced today included Dr. Harri-
son J. Pemberton, Jr., associate pro-
fessor of philosophy; Jefferson D.
Futch, instructor in history; and
John Nichols, instructor in mathe-
matics. All appointments are ef-
fective September 1, 1962.

Dr. Pemberton currently is an as-
sistant professor at the University of
Virginia. Futch is working toward
his Ph.D. degree at the Johns Hop-
kins University, while Nichols is
doing graduate work at the Univer-
sity of Virginia.

Dr. Duvall’s appointment fills a

 

vacancy in the Washington and Lee
faculty which developed when Dr.
Marvin B. Perry resigned as head
of the Department of English to be-
come Dean of Admissions at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Dr. Duvall, 38, is a native of Nor-
folk and a 1949 A.B. graduate of the
University of Virginia where he was
elected to membership in Phi Beta
Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa.
He received his M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from Princeton University in
1951 and 1955.

A scholar of literature in the
American South, Dr. Duvall taught
briefly at Princeton before joining
the Dartmouth faculty in 1953. In
1957-58, he was a Fulbright Visit-
ing Lecturer at the University of
Mainz in Germany. During World
War II and the Korean War he serv-
ed as an officer in the United States
Marine Corps.

Dr. Pemberton, 37, joined the Uni-
versity of Virginia faculty in 1954

after three years as an instructor
of philosophy at Yale University.
He received his B.A. degree in 1949
from Rollins College and his Ph.D.
degree in 1952 from Yale where he
was a resident fellow of Pierson
College.

During World War I, Dr. Pember-
ton was an army cartographer in
the Pacific. He is a native of Orlan-
do, Fla.

Futch, 30, a native of Baltimore,
received his B.A. degree from Johns
Hopkins in 1955. He has continued
toward his doctorate in European
History at Johns Hopkins as a
Woodrow Wilson Fellow and as a
teaching assistant. He is a veteran of
Army service in Italy.

Nichols, 28, a native of Norfolk,
received his B.S. degree at Hamp-
den-Sydney College in 1956. As a
member of the Naval Reserve he
taught mathematics and other sub-
jects for four years at the Bain-
bridge Naval Preparatory School.

U.S. Lagging
Claims Reston

Before SIPA

By STEVE SMITH

James B. Reston, nationally syndi-
cated New York Times columnist,
today told 1,100 high school journal-
ists in Doremus Gymnasium for the
SIPA meet that there is a lag be-
tween America’s “development of
institutions” and the “pace of his-
tory.”

Reston said the United States has
developed faster than any other
nation in history, and yet we “find
ourselves falling far behind in many
aspects.”

He emphasized the many changes
of this century, such as population
explosion, the westward movement
across America, automation, and the
new independence of young nations.

These changes have taken place

 

 

while the “decisive power” which
once rested in western Europe has
passed to the U.S. and the Soviet
| Union, the “least experienced” of

the great nations in the conduct of
foreign affairs.
As a result, Reston said, almost all |

| the activity in Washington today is|
part of the effort to “adjust to these
|enormous changes.” In spite of all}
| oficets. the changes have outrun the |
| adjustments.
Reston cited an example from the |
|time of the Eisenhower Doctrine
| which was passed for protection of
the Middle East. At the time of the
proposal of the Doctrine,

Conservatives
Plan Paper,
TV Appearance

By LARRY MEEKS

Wyatt Durrette, newly elected
president of the Conservative So-
ciety, announced last night that the
Conservatives will release the first
issue of a new paper tentatively
named “The Southern Conservative,”
during the latter part of next week.

Durrette described the paper as a
“journal of conservative opinion.’

The paper will be published each
month and distributed free. It will
be financed by contributions; there
will be no advertisements.

It will be sent out to all Virginia

colleges, several Virginia high
schools, and any other interested
groups.

Fifteen hundred copies of the first
issue will be printed and distributed,
and according to Durrette, “If it
meets with success, we hope to ex-
pand it in size and number.”

Elected with Durrette to serve the
remainder of this year and the first
semester of next year were Ned
Ames as vice president, Dan Balfour
as secretary, and Mike Sussman as
treasurer.

Durrette is a freshman law student
and president of his class. He did
his undergraduate work at VMI,
where he was president of his class
each year.

Recently a three-part article en-
titled “The Rise of Conservatism in
Western Virginia,” dealing with the
conservative movement at W&L and
two other schools, was published in
the Roanoke Times. As a result of
these articles, the group has been
asked to appear on a television |
program on May 8.

If plans work out, three members
of the Society will appear on the|
program. Brent Arthur, Joe Spivey, |
and Durrette have been named as
the three students.

Student Wit

Mason New, Frank Young,
Hot Nuts, Buddy Holley, and a flock
of other prominent entertainers
were mentioned as possible perform-
ers for next year in the Dance Board
poll conducted yesterday during
campus student body elections.

New was mentioned in one ballot
as a possible back-up man for Chuck
Berry. Young received support as a
guitarist for Leon Bibb.

The Hot Nuts were mentioned in
at least 100 ballots, but Buddy Hol-
ley received only a handful of votes.
Johnny Horton, the Big Bopper,
and Ritchie Valens were mentioned
on two ballots.

The only other student who re-
ceived support was campus conser-
vative Brent Arthur, who was first
choice on one ballot calling for
Arthur, Eleanor Roosevelt, and the
ADA singers.

Here are a few other sample bal-
lots:

US. Bonds, the Esso Steel Band.

Bing Crosby, Louis Watts, and the
Harlem Globetrotters.

Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, Roy
Acuff, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers.

Leon Bibb, the Pope, and Liberace.

Rudy Vallee, Leonard Bernstein,
Ding Dong and the Bells.

One student wrote only one word
on his ballot, and that was APA-
THETIC in capital letters.

Another filled in the preference
blanks with two big words, FRA-
TERNITY COMBOS.

The only person who signed his
ballot was Worth Brown, who nom-
inated Arthur.

Record Turnout

A record turn-out at the polls pro-
duced what is perhaps the most sig-
nificant University Party victory
in recent years.

The only close race was for presi-
dent of Fancy Dress, where Ham
Emory defeated Roger Paine, 546 to
491, a 55-vote margin.

On all the other races, it was
strictly no contest. The University
Party had the candidates, got the
votes, and won the elections going
away. Things were as simple as that.

Ireland comfortably defeated Bob
Payne, 642-401 for the presidency;
Boardman defeated Meade Christian,
563-478 for the vice presidency; and
Butler defeated Chuck Lane, 635-
392 for the position of secretary.

Boardman Impressive

Butler and Ireland were clear fav-
orites during the entire political
campaign, but Boardman’s win may
have surprised a few people who
considered Christian the Indepen-
dent party’s brightest hope.

For many people, however, Board-
man’s victory was easily predictable.

Christian had earlier been men-
tioned as the strongest presidential
candidate in school, and his decision
not to run for student body president
may have hurt him seriously in his
attempt at the vice-presidency.

During the campaign, Christian
never seemed to take an active in-
terest in the election, a serious po-
litical mistake in a party that starts
off each race as an underdog.

Boardman, on the other hand, put
on probably the best campaign by a
University Party candidate in sev-
eral years, and his active interest
and intelligent political manipula-
tions paid off in the only “upset”
win of the elections.

With the exception of the Fancy
Dress race, all the University Party
candidates won easily. Supak de-
feated Mike Harris, 575-458; Croft
defeated Dan Balfour 627-404; and
Knight defeated Ross Kyger 568-
456.

No Upset in "62

As early as Tuesday, most people
were beginning to realize that this
year was not going to be another
1961, when the Independent Party
won four Big Seven positions in
the biggest political upset in W&L
history.

Ireland and Butler were already
established as strong favorites, and
sentiment for Boardman was begin-
ning to grow.

On Wednesday night, the Indepen-
dent party candidates made a public
appearance in the Commons, but re-
ceived few visible signs of support
from freshmen who appeared more

PiKA’s Show

About 25 zealous PiKA’s proved

The policeman asked Stevenson
for a drivers’ license. Stevenson ad-
mitted he didn’t have one. The po-
liceman gave him the opportunity
to fight the fire in lieu of going to
court. Stevenson readily accepted,
and was told to report to the blazing
mountain by 5:30.

Fire trucks battled in an effort to
stifle the blaze which threatened
the whole Buffalo Creek area.

Meanwhile, Stevenson persuaded
Fox Urquhart to go back with him
at 5:30. In the process, he incited the

gentlemen piled into a station wagon
headed for Buffalo Creek and glory.

Once they got there, complications

was a 12-year-old named Charlie

who was upset because his cigarettes
had got wet. Without an expert, the
Washington and Lee fire brigade was
helpless, because they couldn’t figure

out how to fill plastic bags with
water and keep their fire nozzles
closed, too.

The mountain was too damn much

heavier, the terrain grew steeper,

grew less dauntless.

A Dreary

The elections are over. To the surprise of nobody who can
count, the University Party swept the boards. It wasn’t even

much of a campaign.

The platform plank which showed any originality at all
was the University Party’s stand for more freshman representa-

tion On campus committees.

Not that there wasn’t plenty to argue about. The Honor
system is still open to criticism and certainly needs more dis-
cussion in all respects. It seems remarkable to us that no candi-
date for a Big Three post chose to offer a delineation of his
personal feeling on the Honor System. It is even more remark-
able that none of the students who were so upset about the
Honor System last month chose to sound out the candidates. |
While nearly all of us agree on the basic principles of the
Honor System there is still plenty of room for disagreement

among ourselves. Differences

exist and we need very badly to give such differences a thorough

airing.

There is also need for student initiative in clearing up the
continued mess in the athletic department. We would like to
see the EC use their prestige to encourage some academic im-

provements in the University.

Ireland, Boardman, and Butler can provide strong and
creative leadership for the student body despite the lack luster
campaign. We congratulate them on their victory and wish

them luck.

ROTC Juniors In The Field
For Leadership Problem Series

Continuing with its program of in-
the-field application of classroom in-
struction, last week the ROTC De-
partment confronted its junior class
cadets with a series of leadership
reaction problems.

The course for this problem was
divided into five stations, each sta-
tion representing a new situation.
The cadets ran each problem in
groups of five with one of them des-
ignated as leader.

Control of the group was com-
pletely up to this particular cadet,
in order to test each member on his
leadership ability.

Members of the senior class were
given a chance to demonstrate their
acting ability by portraying indi-
viduals whom the patrols encounter-
ed and had to cope with.

A similar course will be adminis-
tered to the juniors at their summer
camp. By giving them an acquaint-
ance with the general problems in-
volved, they will have at least an
understanding of the requirements

 

to be placed on them in subsequent
tests and as actual leaders of func-
tioning units.

In the various problems, the groups
were forced to deal with a soldier
who panics and apparently goes ber-
serk in the face of the enemy, a
farmer who adamantly insists they
“get off his land,” captured and
wounded aggressor soldiers, and a
seriously wounded USS. soldier.

Each patrol is assigned a mission,
such as the destruction of an enemy
ammunition dump or finding electri-
cal equipment lost in a field. In at-
tempting to accomplish their mis-
sions they are met with surprise sit-
uations they must handle in addi-
tion to accomplishing the assigned
mission.

Enthusiastic participation on the
part of both juniors and seniors was
the key to the effectiveness of the
problems. This sort of involvement
was demonstrated in one incident
where the senior portraying the

The elections are over.

A furious, hectic week of hand-
shaking, arguing speculating and
planning has come and gone, leaving
a campus cluttered with useless
posters as the only physical sign of
its ever having been.

The effects of the week’s activities
will be far-reaching. The University
Party is once again in control, and
with it will come drastic innovations
in freshman assimilation; the Non-
fraternity Student have gained new
respect from the fraternity men in
both parties—for the Independent
Houses realize, certainly with frus-
tration, that the determining factor
in the UP victory was the almost-
solid support of the NFU’s. The Uni-

 

 

versity Party realizes this, too, and
chances are, they will remember it
when the non-fraternity men need
a favor.

What about the week itself? For
seniors, juniors, and even sopho-
mores, the terrific complexity of
Washington and Lee politics is old
hat.

The Freshmen Watched With Awe

But it’s a different story with the
freshmen. With a certain amount of
awe and bewilderment, we watched
as the wheels of party activity start-
ed rolling. The significance of party
ties became more clear, and we
watched—no one with complete un-
derstanding of what was happening—
as upperclassmen talked of “cliques”

ting the pressures of the past week and celebrating the University Party’s victory.

objective thoughtfulness to the
sometimes emotional election.

Mud slinging gave the contest the
air of a public election, when one of
the two parties produced a profusion
of literature full of such words as
“hypocrisy”, “gravy train,” and “in-
sincerity.” Mostly, though, the dirt
was ignored and served only to make
things more comfortable.

By HOWARD SLATER

Leo Tolsty is considered by many
to be the greatest realistic novelist;
and at the root of his treatment of
realism was his belief that actions
and events are the proving ground
and the revelation of ideas and atti-
tudes.

Two simultaneous events in this
past hectic week, and the compara-
tive attendance at each of them, re-
vealed the prevailing attitude among
my fellow students. The two events
to which I refer were the Spring
Music Concert presented by the
Glee Club and The Brass Choir, and
a pre-election beer rally sponsored
by one of the student political par-
ties.

The first event, the concert, was
witnessed by a pitifully small au-
dience, despite excellent publicity,
worthy performers and a fine and
varied program. The second event,
the Beer Rally—it has been re-
ported; I am proud to say I was not
there—was a success in terms of the
amount of students which were at-
tracted to it.

Dear to Our Collective Heart

Here we have, it seems to me, a
perfect illustration of what Tolstoy

 

| SHH

 

———

meant by the revelation of attitudes

 

through events. The comparative at-
tendance at each of the functions is
a telling commentary on what the
student holds dear to its collective
and over-stimulated heart.

Let us take into account the fact
that even had there been no other
attraction, may students simply do
not care for the type of entertain-
ment offered at Lee Chapel Wednes-
day night. Let us also take into ac-
count the fact that there were men
at the Beer Rally drawn thiter by
purely political considerations.

Having made these allowances, it
is nonetheless true that student in-
terest in the campaign and election
was far from intense this year; and
it is both logical and reasonable to
assume, therefore, that the Beer Ral-
ly was aptly named. An excellent
example of the magnetism of beer.

Beer: a Thing of Value

This is what the student body has
illustrated to be one of its most
objects of value. It is not exactly
a revelation of a previously unknown
attitude, however. The point has
been made time and time again in
the past. The IFC, for instance, has
notoriously brief meetings; yet that
august body deliberated for over an
hour (and two meetings in a row

 

Proving Ground For Student Attitudes:
Beer Rally Conquers Spring Concert

at that) on the problem of when
and when not to have combos.

The incident which has most af-
fected the student body this year has
been the faculty decision to ban
combos for the entire evening on
which University society functions
occur. Big deal! This is quite an
issue to become upset about. What
unknown profundity lurks in the
hearts and minds of this seemingly
disinterested student mass.

‘A Sickness of Attitude’

But of course the most obnoxious
attitude of all is that which links
drinking with both manly and
gentlemanly virtues. The real man
in this kind of atmosphere, it seems
to me, is the one who makes a habit
of refusing to participate in this
dead-end method of achieving per-
sonal stature. Needless to say, the
veneration of drinking is represen-
tative of a wider sickness of atti-
tude—not because drinking is im-
moral in itself, but because of what
it has come to stand for among its
devotees.

It will be a profound relief, and no
regret at all for me when I enter
a sober and saner world; leaving be-
hind these half-hearted student guz-
zlers to stew in their own vomit.

 

Law School
Boasts Many

Achievements

By BILL ATWELL
The Washington and Lee Law
School seems sometimes to be treated
by the undergraduate student body
as more or less a distant relation to

the rest of the University.
This is a little puzzling when one
thinks of the integral part law
students play in the various facets

ijof W&L life. At the present time
‘| we have a law student as President

of the Student Body and by the time
this is printed another law student
will either have won or lost an
election for the same office.

Since law students have been en-
trusted with high office and respon-
sibility the undergraduate might en-

‘| joy learning a little more about the

Law School.

Lexington Law School

It had its origin in an institution
called the Lexington School of Law,
which was established by Judge
John W. Brockenbrough in 1849. In
1866, after General Lee had become
President of Washington College,
he invited Judge Brockenbrough’s
Law Classes to become affiliated
with the college and to meet in col-
lege buildings.

It is interesting to note that dur-
ing the following period the diplomas
given by the School of Law and
Equity at Washington College were
signed by General Lee as President,
as well as by Judge Brockenbrough.

On June 22, 1870, the School of
Law was Officially made one of the
regular Schools of the College.

The accomplishments of graduates
of the W&L Law School would fill
volumes; but I will limit myself to
discussing two of the most renowned.

Two prominent Law Graduates

The Late John W. Davis received
his B.A. from Washington and Lee
in 1892 and his LL.B from the School
of Law in 1895. He became Soliciter
General of the United States and
later U. S. Ambassador to Great
Britain.

Newton D. Baker received his
LL.B. in 1894 and went on to be
Secretary of War in Woodrow Wil-
son’s cabinet during World War I.

The names of these men are an
indelible part of the University to-
day, for Baker and Davis dormitories
are named for them.

The Washington and Lee School of
Law has also had four of its gradu-
ates serve as President of the Amer-
ican Bar Association. As Dean
Charles P. Light of the School of
Law said, “This is indeed a notable
record for a small institution.”

The Conflict of Student Government: A Faculty View

By JOHN M. GUNN, JR.

Student self-government in some
form is characteristic of almost all
American colleges and universities.
It is in the nature of student gov-
ernment for its form to change as
time passes and for its authority
to ebb and flow. Changes in the
nature and degree of self-govern-
ment by students cause recurrent
controversy in the nation’s univer-
sities. For the past four years the
controversy has been particularly
active at Washington and Lee.

Historically and currently, Wash-
ington and Lee students have been
privileged to self-government in an
unusual degree. This government,
of course, is subject to the ultimate
control of the faculty, to whom re-
sponsibility and authority for the
government of students is delegated
by the University’s Board of Trus-
tees. We may presume, however, that
the Trustees approve heartily—even
joyously—the transfer to students of
as much of this responsibility as they
are willing to assume.

 

The Role of Self-Government

Self-government is a proper and
significant part of a liberal educa-
tional experience. It contributes im-
measurably to development of stu-
dents as independent and responsible
citizens of a free society. It brings
to students for several years prior to
their adulthood some of the very
freedom, the enjoyment and preser-
vation of which a liberal education is
designed to make possible. It has the
incidental benefit of relieving mem-

bers of the faculty of regulatory |

chores.

Because students’ goverance of
themselves is sound educational pol-
icy, the faculty is willing, and in
truth it is anxious, to increase the
responsibility of the students for

mittee by its commendable perform-

will be renewed, and in time its

Authority Can’t Be Irrevocable

There is, however, a high correla-
tion between the amount of freedom
in government students may be per-
mitted to enjoy and the success of
their own government in advancing
their development. Since there is
never assurance of continuity in the
success of student self-government,
a grant of authority to students to
govern themselves cannot be irre-
vocable.

This is not to say that whenever
an organ of student government
makes a mistake it should lose its
authority. Indeed, the development-
al function of self-governance can
be fulfilled only if students have
opportunities to learn from their
mistakes, and there is little freedom
in a society unless there is freedom
to make mistakes. It is only when
student agencies of government
prove unwilling to fulfill responsi-
bilities they have assumed that these
responsibilities are likely to be with-

 

drawn,

Now let us consider the immediate
issues of student government at
Washington and Lee. Since 1958 sev-
eral regulations have been issued by
the faculty in matters that had been
subject to the authority of the Inter-
fraternity Council for a number of
years previously. I believe these
regulations have not been issued by
a trigger-happy faculty, as has been
suggested. Rather, they have been
issued by a reluctant faculty, for
whom the easier course would have
been to ignore undesirable condi-
tions and hope they would go away.
But these were the very conditions
that requires a responsible faculty
to act.

IFC Weakness Is Structure

If in the past the Interfraternity
Council has failed to deal adequately
with many of the problems before
it, I suggest it has not been primarily
the fault of the personnel who have
been its members. Its lack of strength
has been a consequence of its struc-

' ture. So long as individual fraterni-

 

ties insist upon ratifying all but the
most trivial actions taken by the
IFC, the IFC is critically handicap-
ped in attempting to do the job that
the students and faculty alike want
it to do. It can discharge no greater
responsibilities than the fraternities
give it authority.

I am willing to recount the events
that preceded recent faculty actions
to any student who wishes them re-
counted. However, I have little taste
for recounting the IFC’s past failures,
and for me to do so here would
scarcely contribute to construction
of future success.

Issues at Hand

Construction there is to be done.
Several issues that cannot be un-
tended indifinitely remain before the
students of the University. These
include: (1) Despite a strong direc-
tive from the Board of Trustees in
1956 and the IFC’s assumption, at
its own request, of responsibility for
enforcement of this directive, hazing
practices inimical to the purposes
of the University continue to be ex-

 

ercised by all but three of the eigh-
teen fraternities on campus; (2)
rushing procedures have been
changed little for many years during
which a number of defects have be-
come both more apparent and more
important.

Students Should Act

The faculty would have preferred
students to resolve the conflicts be-
tween fraternity parties and the Uni-
versity social functions. The faculty
would prefer now that students seize
control of the problems cited above
and other problems remaining before
the student body.

I believe in total that in matters
of student government the interest
of the students and faculty are not
so divergent as controversy over
passing issues makes them seem.
Students and faculty have a common
interest in large, responsible, and
vital self-government of students.
Your freedom is also our freedom.
Your development is the justification
of our lives.

Win Dual

Meet, Top Lynchburg

The trackmen of Washington and Lee won their fourth

McGowin Stars
Despite Defeat

The baseball team dropped its fifth
straight game Wednesday to Bridge-
water by a score of 6-1.

Despite the loss, Mason Mc-
Gowin looked sharp on the mound.
With the exception of the 8th when
Bridgewater pushed across four runs
after two were out, McGowin was
very effective. He struck out 11
while walking only two. The lone
run for the Generals came in the
fifth inning when Hobbs was safe on
an error, Williams singled, and
Hobbs came home on a sacrifice fly
by Jim Russ.

Lou Flanagan, starting his first
game for the Generals, led the team
in hitting with a double and a
single.

Bridgewater tallied one in the 2nd
and one in the 6th to make the score
2-1 going into the eightth. A series
of singles brought the Bridgewater
total to a winning sixth in the 8th.

The Generals have a heavy slate
during the next week with four
games scheduled. The next home
game is May 1 against Hampden-
Sydney.

 

Lacrosse Team In Good
Shape For North Carolina

The W&L stickmen, having had a
disappointing season so far this year
being winless in eight starts, feel
they are ready to break their jinx
this weekend. The Generals meet the
University of North Carolina on
Wilson Field at 2:30 p.m. with one
of the most complete teams they
have fielded yet.

Plagued with unfortunate injuries
for a good part of the season ,the
lacrosse team has been hampered by
being forced to use some of their
most potent players only sparingly.

Coach Bob McHenry commented
that he may move some of the more
outstanding “B” team boys up to the
varsity to increase the depth of the
team. With the team in good physical

Essex won the 440 yd. run in 503
seconds. Henry Sackett won the hop,
step, and jump with 41’ 1 1/2” and

Coach Lord, extremely happy
with the team effort in the last
meets, will take the entire team to
the Davidson Relays this weekend.
The team with a 4-1 record will
go as top contender. Dr. Roberts,
the pole vault coach; Coach Mc-
Laughlin, the field coach; and Coach
Lord all feel the team is not at
full power with 52 men, lacking
depth only in the high and low
hurdles.

John Pearson, Skip Essex, Kit
Kell, and Captain Jim Hickey will
each be running 110 yards in the
440 yard relay at the Davidson re-
lays. This sprint team will be con-
centrating on breaking the existing
440 yd. Davidson Relay record.

Golfers Divide
Two Matches

By RICK CARRELL

The Washington and Lee
team moved the team’s season rec-
ord to 2-3 by splitting a two match
road trip to eastern Virginia.

The team dropped a 6-3 decision
to William and Mary on Monday.
Vardaman and Henry took points
in the individual matches and the
best ball of Grantham Couch and
Vardaman took the Generals’ third
point. Steve Henry copped medal-
ist honors with an 80.

Tuesday, the linksmen moved back
on a winning course with a strong
7-2 victory over Norfolk Division of
William and Mary. They picked up
points in five of six individual
matches and in 2 of 3 best ball
matches. Vardaman and Lee coasted
to identical 6 and 5 victories, Couch
won four and three, Hughes won 2
and 1, and Stewart took a 3 and 2
decision.

Vardaman and Couch took an
overwhelming 7 and 6 victory in the
best ball competition. Henry, Mon-
day’s medalist, was the only Gen-
eral to lose in individual play, being
downed by a scant 2 and 1 score.

The team has three more matches
scheduled and will begin play in the
State Tournament next monday.

Relay Team Plans Assault

On Davidson

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Washington and Lee’s crack relay team of Kit Kell, Skip
Essex, John Pearson and Jim Hickey will go to the Davidson
Relays this weekend, with an eye on the 440, the 880, and the
Sprint medley relay records. Should these four trackmen run
at their peak Saturday, any of the records for these relays

Meet Records

 

could be broken.

Jim Hickey holds the W&L record
in the 100 and 220 yd. dash, and Kit
Kell, a freshman, has offered a
strong challenge to Hickey all sea-
son. Skip Essex, an extremely versa-
tile runner, has marked up times of
50.1 and 50.3 seconds in the 440 yard
run in the last two meets.

John Pearson pulled a double up-
set in the high and low hurdles

against Norfolk last Saturday and
ran an outstanding time in win-
ning the 220 yard low hurdles in
the Lynchburg meet here Tuesday.

These sprinters will be running
against a record time of 43.7 seconds

 

Tennis Team

Defeats R-M

The Washington and Lee tennis
team traveled to Randolph-Macon
Wednesday and soundly defeated its
rather deceptive opponent 6-3, thus
evening the season’s record at 2-2.

Captain John Baker found quite a
surprise when he trounced his man
6-0 in the first set, only to be

ot turned back after a hard match in
‘| the next two sets, 6-1, 7-5. Playing
.|in the number four

position, Jim
Mell lost a tough one to his man
man after another three-set battle,
6-4, 3-6, 6-1.

Randy Jones found little difficul-
ty with the number two man win-
ning his match, 6-2, 6-2. Jim De-
Young and Bud Hollman also won
for the Generals, 6-1, 6-3 and 6-4,
6-1, respectively. Freshman Lindsey
Short made the match 3-2 with his
win in the number six spot, 7-5, 6-1.

It was the doubles’ matches that
made the difference. Captain Baker
and Randy Jones lost their number
one doubles, 6-1, 6-2. But the strong
teams of DeYoung and Short along
with Mell and Hollman powered
their way through their opponents,
winning the second doubles, 6-3, 6-4
and the third, 6-2, 6-3.

The team continues its trip on
down to William and Mary for a
match Thursday, and then returns
to play Richmond here this Satur-
day.

the issues of the elections were, and

The day of voting came finally,

Now the election is over, the at-

with the discarded posters and tem-

voters.

The color and glamor of a “real”

When the student independent
newspaper Protest, perhaps the big-

Independent Party chances took an
even bigger dive than expected.

By five in the afternoon, when the

was unnecessary.
