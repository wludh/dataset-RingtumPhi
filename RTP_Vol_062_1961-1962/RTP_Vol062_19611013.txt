Conservative Society To Sponsor
‘Operation Abolition’ Showing

William S. P. Cotter, organization-
al director for Young Americans for
Freedom, will speak here at 7:30
p.m. Tuesday, sponsored by the Con-
servative Society.

The head of the national organiza-
tion of conservative groups on some
125 American college and univer-
sity campuses, Cotter will address

Colin Wilson
To Speak Here

A controversial British auth-
or will be the guest speaker
Monday for Washington and
Lee’s 39th Seminar in Litera-
ture.

Colin Wilson will talk about

“The Younger Generation of Writers
in Europe” at an 8:15 p.m. public
addressess in duPont Auditorium. He
will emphasize two European writ-
ers—Kazantzakis and Durenmatt—
and their relation to other contem-
porary authors.

Wilson will remain on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus Tuesday for
individual conferences with stu-
dents.

 

Born in Leicester, England, in 1931, |,

Wilson left school at 16 and worked
as a civil servant and laborer be-
fore settling in Paris to write his
first book, The Outsider (1956).
Called a “diagnosis of the sickness
of modern man,” this work of liter-
criticism analyzed the hero as found
in such writers as Sartre, Camus,
Hemingway, Kierkegaard and Kafka
The book was violently criticized
and as violently defended in the late
1950's.

Other books by Wilson include
Religion and Rebel (1957), The Age
of Defeat (1959) and Ritual in the
Dark (1960).

a public audience in the university’s
duPont Auditorium. His talk will be
followed by the showing of the
film, “Operation Abolition.”

Since it was first released in 1960,
“Operation Abolition,” which is sup-
posed to show how the riots of col-
lege students against the House Un-
American Activities Committee in
San Francisco in 1959 were Com-
munist-led, has been the focus of
a national controversy.

Young Americans for Freedom was
founded last year in New York and
its national membership has grown
to 21,000. The Conservative Society
here was formed last Spring by a
group of Washington and Lee stu-
dents and townspeople. Brent Ar-
thur is president.

“Sure, McCutcheon graduated from W&L. He played on

Well, so what?

“This means that Joe will be ‘coming home’ this weekend.

“History is bunk!”

This sentiment, first expressed by
Henry Ford a half-century ago, is
still the attitude of millions of
Americans today, according to W.
Howard Adams, a graduate of the
Washington and Lee Law Schools
and first editor of Shenandoah, who
spoke here Wednesday night.

“We as people have never cared
much about our history,” Adams
said, “and we have our ‘Founding
Fathers’ to thank for this. It seems
to them that the history before the
American Revolution was imperfect
and should be forgotten. An aware-
ness of the past seemed to be a vio-
lation of the democratic spirit, only
so recently established.”

As a result of this anti-history
pattern in early America and
strengthened in the 18 Century, the
cultivation of historical “passion”
was lost he said. Today the virtues
needed for such a historical sense
are all but lost, except in some of
the “bustling circuses” that are be-
ing put on in commemoration of the
Civil War.

History as Entertainment

“And the saga of the Opening
of the West has been reduced to
something less than a passion on
the television westerns,” Adams said.
“History was not meant to serve as
entertainment at Williamsburg or
Disnyland. At times it’s hard to tell
where one of them leaves off and
the other takes up.”

Americans have developed a de-
sire that their life should be free

 

 

 

 

 

from history—they have the desire
' to break from an unsatisfactory past.

Alumnus Adams Says Americans
Are Insensitive To History

Like their forefathers, they believe
that this is the land of beginning
again and that it does not need a
past. This feeling was especially
strong after the Civil War. The gulf
existing between each generation
then started growing larger. Most
of the people of the 18th Century
were either indifferent towards their
period of history, or they hated it.
It turned out that most of them
hated their century.

America: Beauty to Ugliness

“A visitor to America once re-
marked that in fifty years America
had turned from the most beautiful
country in the world to one of the
ugliest because of our constant war
against nature;”’ Adams said, “our
forces were bent on disfiguring our
country. People don’t realize that the
past and nature are inseparable. Our
environment played a major role in
the history of this country. We must
conserve and adapt nature so that
the presence of the past will live
today.”

Adams cited two examples of the
indifference towards historical places.
“The bulldozers were well into the
leveling of the land around Walden
Pond, which was made so famous
by Thoreau, before a loud protest
was raised.

“And today a large sewage plant
is being built in Maryland across
from Mount Vernon. This is the
smell of indecency which only the
federal government could think of,”
Adams said.

ROTC Plans
New Activities

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee’s green-clad
soldiers-to-be are embarking on
what promises to be a busy and
in some respects experimental year.

Shceduled for the last week in
October is a “night compass prob-
lem” for all students in the ROTC
program. This entails detailing nine
or 10 men with a compass and a cer-
tain destination to reach using the
compass.

The night compass program, exe-
cuted by companies, was instituted
last year at W&L.

Also at the end of October the
freshmen will fire .22 calibre rifles,
culminating their initial marksman-
ship training.

In March juniors will fire MI
rifles. This is new to the univer-
sity this year. (The MI rifle is the
rifle which is presently part of every
soldier’s basic equipment.)

For the first time juniors will this
year go through a combat leaders’
course. Four simulated battle situa-
tions will be given to four-man
teams. A different cadet will act as
“leader” in each situation, present-
ing a solution to the combat problem.

Maj. Edward J. Roxbury said a
typical “situation” might be hand-
ling a wounded man with a pris-
oner of war or fixing a broken jeep
axle in a battle environment.

In April, platoon attack problems
will be conducted. An annual affair,
this consists of putting the various
platoons on a mock battlefield under
fire. Men will be equipped with
weapons and blank ammunition for
the attack.

A feature of the ROTC program
to Washington and Lee is set for the
second semester. A course in western
military history for freshmen is be-
ing planned. The ROTC department
has received two Lee Scholarship
grants to produce a text for the
course.

eens Stud Bowl: Story Of Byron’s Brainchild

By STEVE HENRY

Alumni returning for Homecoming
this year will undoubtedly be over-
joyed to hear that Washington and
Lee has been officially invited to
participate in the first showing of
the new CBS television program,
College Stud Bowl.

The Stud Bowl, in case you did
not know already, is the brain child
of a young CBS executive named
George Gordon Byron.

Byron, who claims ancestry to the
late Lord of the same general name,
attended the University of Virginia,
where he was the biggest stud on
campus for all of the six years he
spent in the undergraduate school
there.

When he finally graduated, his
classmates erected a placard in his
honor on a tree near Jefferson’s
home. The placard read, “Here’s
to good old George Gordon Byron,
the stupidest stud in the world.”

That was what bugged Byron. The
part about being stupid.

He got the title during the year
When UVa was asked to appear on
the College Quiz Bowl.

Byron showed up for the initial

try-out session for the Quiz Bowl)

squad, his mind made up that he
would appear on television, snow
the general public with his studli-
ness, and draw numerous small town
idols to the good University.

Unfortunately, Byron blanked the
entire general knowledge quiz. He
scored a remarkable zero out of a
hundred questions, based entirely
on what was going on in the world.

His classmates, who until that time
had admired George for being such a
stud, sensed immediately a small
flaw in their idol.

George’s popularity waned from
day to day after his disastrous
quiz bowl try-out, and the entire
business was culminated by the
plaque put up by his disillusioned
class-mates.

Ever since then, George had har-
bored a distinct distaste for the
College Quiz Bowl program.

Shortly after graduation, George
entered a profession entirely suited
to his intellectual ability. It was
television.

Within a few short months, the
men at the top realized that they
had something rare

 

in George—a |
man who perfectly understood the)
taste of the American television |

viewing public.

All George had to do was to
say that he liked a program, and
immediately the network would put
the show on the air, figuring that
what was bad enough for George to
like was good enough for the coun-
try.

George, who has become well
known at CBS as G. G., moved up
the ladder of success until he final-
ly found himself in program re-
search.

One day he was called into the
office of his employer.

“G.G.” said the boss.
trouble.”

“Why so, chief?” asked George.

“Because of the College Quiz
Bowl. It’s taking away our Sun-
day afternoon viewing audience.
Surely there’s something we can
do.”

“T’ll sleep on it, chief,” answered
George.

On his way home that night, Byron
was thinking about the hated Quiz
Bowl and how it might even cost
him his job if he didn’t come up
with a program to challenge it.

“We're in

Suddenly, he had it—the idea he
had been looking for.
Why not a College Stud Bowl?

The way he had it figured, there
was no way for the program not
to work. The American public, al-
ways a stud-minded group, would
take immediately to the idea of
watching a fine group of young
American stallions answer questions
concerning studliness in general.

It would all be so much more
interesting than all those idiotic
questions about politics, sports, and
other such absurd subjects.

The next morning, he popped his
idea to the Chief.

“That’s great, G. G.,”
Chief. “How did you ever think of
that?”

Then he forgot about his job and |

The questions, which would be
answered by the teams within a 20
second period, would deal with the
following topics of interest: girls,

liquor, drinking, automobiles, and
combos.
The team that could come up

with what the board of judges con-
sidered the best answer would get
the points for the question, and the
contest would be decided by total-
ing the points acquired during the
half-hour program.

The panel of judges—a sauve lit-
tle group itself—included Paul New-
man, Marlon Brando, David Niven,

Intra-Mural Football
Begins Next Tuesday

By HOWIE KORMAN
I-M Editor

The 1961 intramural football season gets underway on
Tuesday, October 17, when the defending champion PiKA
meets Phi Gam in a 2 p.m. encounter on the I-M field.

According to head football official Larry Smail, three
games will be played on two days each week through Nov. 13.

In Progress

Washington and Lee intramurals
opened on September 27, with golf
and tennis matches being played.

Golf teams from 19 campus organi-
zations are participating.

One team in each of the four
leagues is presently undefeated.

Both the defending golf champions
Phi Delt and Phi Gam are unbeaten
in three matches in Leagues A and
B respectively.

SAE and KA lead Leagues C and
B®

Regular play in the leagues end
next Tuesday, with play-offs begin-
ning immedately after final pairings
are made.

Tennis

With only nine more matches re-
maining to be played, the I-M tennis
championships could be decided in
three of the four divisions in final
day competition. PiKA assured itself
of first place in League A by easily
downing Lambda Chi on October 12.

Also on Wednesday, Phi Kap cap-
tured part of first place in Division
B by upsetting previously undefeat-
ed SAE. Both houses have two and
one records, and have one more
contest to play. SAE will meet a

mediocre SPE unit, while the net-| opp

men from Phi Kap will face Pi Phi
on Wednesday, October 18.

In Division C, the championship
could be decided in the final match
of the year. If KA is able to down
Delt on October 16, they will meet
Beta in a battle of the undefeated.
To date Beta is 3-0, and KA has two
wins. On October 12, the league
leaders easily set back the netters
from Phi Gam 5-0.

Tuesday, October 17, Phi Delt will
meet Sigma Nu in a contest that will
decide first place in League D. Phi
Delt captured their third victory
against no defeats when they top-
ped ZBT 3-2 on Wednesday. Mickey
Bright, Gus Wick, and Giles Walton

while Phi Delt number one man
Wick downed John Rosenberg 6-3,

downed ZBT, 3-2, in their last con-
test.

Pity the poor football player.

While the rest of the student
body parties to all hours of the
morning tonight, Washington and
Lee’s footballers will be padded out
in two secluded Fairfield motels, far
from the revelry and rowidness on
the campus scene.

They’ll be alone out there, too.

Coach Mac is taking his entire
squad to Fairfield tonight imme-
diately after the 7:15 pep rally, just
to make sure that his boys are com-
pletely ready to go against Ran-
dolph-Macon tomorrow.

So dates, booze and combos are all
being left behind, all for the glory
of W&L football.

Watch out for them Saturday
night, though.

M Laughlin’s Charges Look ‘For

Third Straight 1961 Triumph

Washington and Lee’s undefeated
Generals go after their third straight
win tomorrow in a Homecoming
contest against the Randolph-Macon
Yellow Jackets.

Game time is 2 p.m. at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who bombed
Franklin and Marshall 40-0 last Sat-
urday, are seeking their seventh
consecutive win over a_ two-year
period.

Better

Washington and Lee head coach
Lee McLaughlin says that Coach
Joe McCutcheon’s ‘Jackets are a
better team than their 1-2 record
indicates.

R-MC lost Saturday to Western
Maryland, 28-6, in a game where
the ‘Jackets had six passes inter-
cepted.

“Anytime you give up the ball six
or more times in a ball game through
mistakes, you’re going to get hurt,”
McLaughlin points out. “Take those
interceptions out of the game, and
Randolph-Macon may have been the
better team.”

McLaughlin says he expects the
Yellow Jackets to put greater pres-
sure on the W&L defense than either
of the Generals’ earlier opponents.

Typical

“Coach Boyd Williams scouted
Randolph-Macon and he says it’s a
‘typical’ Joe McCutcheon team,” Mc-
Laughlin adds. “They tackle well,
pursue well, block well, and they’ve

got good speed. They’re a very
capable ball club and quite capable
of beating us.”

And McLaughlin adds, “It goes
without saying that Randolph-Ma-
con wants this game very badly.
We haven’t been very generous
hosts on some other ocacsions.”

McLaughlin’s first college victory
came over Randolph-Macon in 1958,
when the Generals snapped a 12-
game losing streak by besting the
Jackets on Wilson Field, 13-12, in
the final 30 seconds. The next year,
again on Wilson Field, the Generals
came from behind twice, from 21-0
and 33-25, to tie R-MC in the final
45 seconds, 33-33. Last year’s score
was 26-3 for W&L, another come-
back effort at Ashland.

So far in two games, McLaughlin
has been disappointed in the ability

 

of his linemen to gouge gaps in op-
posing forward defenses. The down-
field blocking against F&M was ex-
ceptional, he says, but the problem
remains along the scrimmage line.

McLaughlin was pleased with the
general offensive showing W&L
made in its last outing. The Blue
team scored the first three TD’s,
the Red team got one, the Gold an-
other, and the previously untested
White squad came through with a
quick-striking, four-play touchdown
that featured the passing of sopho-
more A. J. Barranco.

Game time for the
Macon scrap is 2 p.m.

W&L spoiled the Randolph-Macon
homecoming last year with their
26-3 win, and the Jackets will be
trying to return the favor.

THE TRUE AND
HARROWING FACTS ABOUT RUSHING

It is well enougn to sit in one’s Morris chair and theorize about
sorority rushing, but if one really wishes to know the facts, one
must leave one’s Morris chair and go out into the field. (My
Morris chair, incidentally, was given to me by the Philip Morris
Company, makers of Marlboro Cigarettes. They are great-
hearted folk, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as millions of
you know who have enjoyed their excellent cigarettes. Only
from bountiful souls could come such mildness, such flavor,
such filters, such pleasure, as you will find in Marlboros! For
those who prefer crushproof boxes, Marlboro is available in
crushproof boxes. For those who prefer soft packs, Marlboro
is available in soft packs. For those who prefer to buy their
cigarettes in bulk, please contact Emmett R. Sigafoos, friendly
manager of our factory in Richmond, Virginia.)

But I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true
facts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and
investigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana
College of Spot Welding and Belles Lettres and interviewed
several million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund
McKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
about how she came to be named Gerund. It seems that her
father, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than any-
thing in the world, and so he named all his children after parts
of speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named
Preposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative
Case. The girls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their
names, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and
was finally found one night dangling from a participle. After
this tragic event, the father abandoned his practice of gram-
matical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently
born to him—eight in all—were named Everett.)

But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named
Gerund McKeever. “Gerund,” I said, “‘were you rushed by a
sorority?”

“Yes, mister,” she said, “I was rushed by a sorority.”

“Did they give you a high-pressure pitch?” I asked. “Did
they use the hard sell?”

“No, mister,” she replied. “It was all done with quiet dignity.
They simply talked to me about the chapter and the girls for
about three minutes and then I pledged.”

“My goodness!”’ I said. ‘““Three minutes is not very long for
a sales talk!’

“It is when they are holding you under water, mister,”
said Gerund.

“Well, Gerund,” I said, ‘Show do you like the house?”

“T like the house fine, mister,” she replied. “But I don’t live
there. Unfortunately, they pledged more girls than they have
room for, so they are sleeping some of us in the bell tower.”

“Isn’t that rather noisy?” I said.

“Only on the quarter-hour,” said Gerund.

“Well, Gerund,”’ I said, “it has certainly been a pleasure talk-
ing to you,’ I said.

“Likewise, mister,” she said, and with many a laugh and cheer
we went our separate ways—she to the campanile, I to the

were shot at Washington and
Lee’s College Bowl team can-

didates in the past two days
as testing to pick the team moved
into a more intensive stage.

The tests were taken by 25 men,
a third of the number which tried
the first test two weeks ago.

Five men were called “head and
shoulders above the others” by
Presidential Assistant Frank Par-
sons, who is charged with picking
and instructing the team. Tom Ly-
bass, Bill Lowry, Jim Campbell,
Rick Anderson, and Greg McNab are
now the foremost candidates for the
four team positions.

Parsons noted the fact that only
one of the present top five, McNabb,
is a fraternity member, while the
remaining four are independents.

McNabb and Anderson are seniors;
Campbell and Lowry, juniors, and
Lybass is a sophomore.

The oral tests simulate conditions
on the quiz bowl show, emphasizing
quick recall of detailed knowledge.
Several faculty members assisted
Parsons in administering the tests.
The first tests required written an-
swers only, although the time limit
of 20 seconds per answer has re-
mained the same for all tests.

Charts are kept for all candidates
to determine their rank in the group,
their nubmer of correct answers on
each test, and the areas in which
they exhibit the most thorough
knowledge.

The W&L College Bowl team will
appear on CBS television on Nov. 12.
The candidates may receive an ear-
lier workout on radio, said Parsons,
if some technical difficulties can be
solved. A radio trial would help to
determine the team members by pre-
senting the aspirants in actual com-
petition atmosphere before an au-
dience.

here for a special two-week instruc-
tional period beginning Monday.

The laboratory will be available to
faculty and advanced science stu-
dents for basic instruction in radio-
isotope techniques, according to an
announcement by Dr. Edward F.
Turner, Jr., Chairman of the de-
partment of physics.

Dr. .William K. Robinson, a phys-
icist from St. Lawrence University,
will be the principal instructor rep-
resenting the Oak Ridge Institute
of Nuclear Studies (ORINS), the
organization which sponsors the
laboratory’s tours to colleges and
universities throughout the United
States.

Instructor for the second week of
classes will be Dr. Kay Ezell, a

institute, will be in charge of labor-
atory work in the mobile unit,
which will be stationed next to Reid
Hall. Classroom instruction will be
held in University rooms.

This will be the first time the mo-
bile laboratory has been brought to
the Washington and Lee campus.
However, the unit has been set up
at other colleges in Virginia.

The Oak Ridge Mobile Radioiso-

tope Training Laboratory Program
was first conceived in 1958 by ORINS
and two vehicles for laboratory use
were presented to the International
Atomic Energy Agency for demon-
stration at Geneva late that year.
After successful tours of European
universities, a third vehicle was de-
signed for use in the United States
beginning in the Fall of 1959.
The two-week course here will
consist of a 90-minute lecture and a
two-hour laboratory class each day
Monday through Friday.

The main theme of his lecture con-

a great nation. He discredited the
theory that abundant natural re-

endowed with greater natural re-
sources than our nation, the differ-
ences between the two colonizing
peoples, the English and the Portu-
guese, contributed heavily to the
formation of these societies.

Carter added that some other great
nations came into existence in the
absence of any resources. He named
the Aztecs, Incas, and Chinese as
examples of this phenomenon.

He contended that, particularly in
the colonial years, the poor New
England soil brought forth from the
settlers great demonstrations of hu-
man ingenuity, pointing out that
under the free enterprise system
they “made a silk purse from a
sow’s ear.”

After completing his talk Dr.
Carter held a brief discussion per-
iod in which topics ranging from
the Amazon River Basin to Com-
munism were discussed.
