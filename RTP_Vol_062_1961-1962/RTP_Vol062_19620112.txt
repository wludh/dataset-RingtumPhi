Southern Collegian
Features Parody

Editor Roger Paine said that there
is “a remote possibility” that the
Fancy Dress issue of The Southera
Collegian will be out on time. “If
that should be the case, which de-
pends largely on exams, the starl-
wart make-up artists in the print
shop, and a bottle of Early Times,
then F.D. goers can look forward
to new heights of repulsion,” ac-
cording to Paine.

A parody on the “Magazine Wo-
men Believe In,” The Ladies’ Home
Journal, will be featured. The usual
low-class trash will, of course, be
included,” he said.

“The magazine will be worth
ing if only for the one non-repulsive
thing in the issue—the girls from
Sweet Briar. The winners of the
“Huffman Cup” will also be an-
nounced,” said Paine, adding, “Col-
legian staff members wish everybody
a Merry Christmas.”

Nagy Criticizes Policies
Of U. S. Toward Russia

Praising the U.S. for its occupation policies and criticizing
its stand in regard to Russian aggression, Ferenc Nagy, for-
mer Prime Minister of Hungary, spoke Tuesday night in

duPont Auditorium on the
Europe.”
Activities in the Hungarian*

Parliamen in 1939 and his participa-
tion in the underground during
World War II resulted in Nagy’s
being imprisoned by the Nazis in
1944. In 1945 he took control of the
Democratic Coalition Government in
Hungary.

In 1947 he was forced into exile
by the Communists, and he now
makes his home in Herndon, Va.

“At this time when the world is
full of problems in Berlin, the Congo,
and Viet Nam,” began Mr. Nagy,
“a discussion of Hungary may not
seem timely.”

“However,” he explained, “these
problems all started when the Soviet
Union used its occupation right to
take control of Hungary.

Focus on Eastern Europe

He added that, as a result of the
Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe,
the world is now split into two
large camps on which rest the bur-
den of the armament race.

“Before the problems of world

 

‘Situation in Central-Eastern

 

diplomats are over,” he said, “the
West must once again focus its at-
tention on Eastern Europe.

Criticizing the arms race, Nagy
said, “We can’t replace a_ well-
planned policy with an armament
race. We are ready to go to our
cellars and increase our arms, but
we are not willing to solve the
problems in Western and Central
Europe.”

He emphasized the difference be-
tween American and Russian occu-
pation policies. The United States,
he said, has replaced dictatorship
with democracy, naming Italy and
West Germany as examples of this
fact. On the other hand, where
there had been democracies, the
Soviets have created dictatorships.

Communism’s Failure Shown

The plight of the people of East-
ern and Central Europe is caused
by the control of Moscow over

Spring Dances To Feature

Two Folk Music Concerts

Full Dress Costume Sales Soar;
Guest Ticket Prices Lowered

By Larry Meeks

After a Dance Board meeting last night, president Steve
Galef announced that the format of Spring Dances has been
changed from one concert, one dance to two concerts. Galef
also revealed the theme of Springs, ““A Folk Music Festival.”

 

PROBES Editor
Finds Sales Good;
Story Commended

The winter edition of Probes went
on sale yesterday and according to
editor Ronald Alenstein, “People
are taking to it well.”

He had these further comments to
make concerning the publication:
“I’ve had many compliments on it.
I'd like to thank all the contribu-
tors. I am happy with their stories
and poems. I'd also like to thank Jay
Green for his illustrations. I’ve re-
ceived several compliments on them
also.”

Probes is the student literary pub-
lication founded last year by Tony
Gray. Only one edition came out
last year, but because of its success,
two issues will be published this
year. According to Alenstein, the
second edition will appear after
Spring Dances.

A copy of Probes may be purch-
ased at McCrum’s, Doc’s, The Co-op
or the College Inn for fifty cents.

Probes was founded last year “to
provide an outlet for student cre-
ativity.” All articles and_ illustra-
tions are by students and any stu-
dent may submit writing or original
drawings for possible publication.

The winter edition contains five
poems and four short stories by
six different writers and several il-
lustrations by Tony Gray.

The five poems are “Lunacy,”
“The Frown of God,” and “Novem-
ber Water Colour,” written by C.
P. White, Jr.; “Husband’s Lament,”
written by editor Ron Alenstein; and
“In the Museum” by W. H. Chaplin.

The four short stories are “Joy,”
by Mike Shepperd; “The Air Show,”
by Steve Henry, “Tiger Zanton and
Mr. Mac,” by Steve Cook; and “A
Small Destruction,” by the editor.

 

Computer Classes To Begin

On Monday, a course for faculty
and administration in the use of
W&L’s new IBM 1620 computer
will begin in the Computer Class
Room next to the present IBM of-
fice. The course will be introductory
and cover the types of computers
and their language with particular
emphasis on the 1620 Data Process-
ing Computer. Manuals will be dis-
tributed and later in the course pro-
gramming problems will be assigned;
about 40 professors have been signed
to date.

Open to any faculty or administra-
tion member, the course will pre-
pare those who take it in using the
computer in their own work.

One of the main purposes for the
University’s new 1620 will be for

Nine Seniors Seeking Honors

By PHIL OLIVER

Nine Washington and Lee seniors
are doing honors work this year.
The seniors, all of whom have been
on the Dean’s List for the last two
years, are Rick Anderson, Dick
Jones, Jim McClung, Bill McKim,
Hugh Paton, Jack Vardaman, Bond
Johnson, Ernest Ladd, and Allen
Stubbs.

Each of the students must take
both oral and written exams on their
whole field of study, made up by the
professors in the student’s depart-
ment,

A thesis of 50 to 100 pages in
length is also required. The amount
of research that goes into a thesis is
important because graduate schools
look closely at the quality and
quantity of the research.

Jim McClung, an English major,
summed up one reason why seniors
undergo the extensive study, re-
search, and writing needed to com-
plete the honors work. He said that
“honors work enhances your chance
of getting into graduate school and
receiving a fellowship.”

McClung’s thesis will be entitled
“The Study of the Moral Order in
the Novels of George Eliot.” He will
read biographies of Eliot, a volume
of letters, and all of her novels.

Rick Anderson, another English

 

major, is writing a thesis which |
he will entitle “Geoffrey Chaucer |
and the Influence of Early French
Writers on the Cantebury Tales.” |
Anderson became interested in|
Chaucer in one of his English Class- |
es. Since he likes French, he said,
“I thought I would try to work
them together.”

Hugh Paton, an American history |
major, will entitle his thesis “Pub- |
lic Opinion in Massachusetts During
the Slavery Controversy.” Paton said
his thesis will be centered around
the Compromise of 1850. Thus far
his research has been mainly in
newspapers dating around 1850. He
said he found this interesting be-
cause of the other articles he found
in the newspapers. “They had many |
of the same problems that we have
today,” he said.

Allen Stubbs, a psychology major,
is doing research on secondary and
primary reinforcement. With the
new department equipment, he will
be doing experiments with rats. The
end result he wishes to achieve
through his research is a correlation
between behavior of rats and the
behavior of humans.

Jack Vardaman, a European his-
tory major, will entitle his thesis
“Arnold Toynbee and Western Civi- |
lization.” Vardaman stated that
Toynbee’s work “A Study of History

 

| will fit the pattern of breakdown to

| en down. In conclusion he will sug-

| 19th century and not the modern-

sets up patterns for history. One of
these patterns shows how civiliza-
tions can break down. Although
Mr. Toynbee does not put Western
civilization to any of his patterns, he
hints in certain sections of “A Study
of History” that Western Civiliza-
tion is breaking down. Vardaman

Western civilization and try to de-
termine whether or not our civiliza-
tion is breaking down or has brok-

gest steps to avert breakdown if it
exists.

Bond Johnson, another European
history major will write on “Arnold
Toynbee: A Study in Social Con-
science.” This Arnold Toynbee is
a contemporary of the Industrial
Revolution in England during the

day historian. The Victorian Toyn-
bee believed that by studying eco- |
nomic history, he could finds the an-
swer to slums and poverty. John-
son’s thesis will be a literary type
of history, a biography, and will in-
clude criticism of Toynbee’s works. |
Johnson has done a great deal of |
letter writing and research for a}
complete picture of a subject about |
which very little is known.

English major Bill MeKim_ will |
entitle his thesis, “John Donne: His |
Recognition of Multiple Perspectives |

 

and His Feelings That There Must
Be One that Transcends All.” In his
thesis McKim will explain how
Donne felt great tension over com-
mitment to one world order. This
one world order according to Donne
was one God for all men. Yet he
was aware that the world can be
ordered by many. A history of the
conflict against tolerance will be
worked into the thesis.

Ernest Ladd of the Commerce
School will entitle his thesis, “The
Effective Federal Reserve Policy in
the recession of 1960-61.” Ladd will
establish a cause and effect relation-
ship between the action of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board and what hap-
pened to the economy. “The reces-

decrease in buying after the mer-
chants had a great inventory build-
up. The Political campaigns caused
a deepening of the recession be-

W&L Receives
DuPont Grant

E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co.,
has given Washington and Lee a
grant of $4,000 for the study of sci-
ence and engineering.

Washington and Lee is one of 76
colleges, of which 22 are privately
endowed, to receive the amount. The
grant was awarded, as in past years,
on the strength of the university s
chemistry department.

The duPont company, of Wilming-
ton, Del., awarded a total of $690,-
000 to 161 colleges and universities.
The program is_ designed for
“strengthening the teaching of sci-
ence and related subjects, for funda-
mental research by universities, and
for facilities for education or re-
search in science and engineering.”

The purpose of the $4,000 given
W&L is to “help them maintain the
excellence of their teaching.”

Debaters Top
H-S Tigers
Monday Night

Washington and Lee’s Debating
Team set down Hampden-Sydney
in a dual meet Monday night as
one General team went undefeated
and the other lost one and tied one
match. The score of 2-1-1 is not in-
dicative of the point spread which
W&L held over their opponents.

Coach William Chaffin took his
team of Ed Norton, Barry Staniar,
Malcolm Morris, and Steve Smith
to Hampden-Sydney for the meet.
Though all are relatively inexper-
ienced, the squad made a fine show-
ing.

Norton and Staniar, who had
never participated in intercollegiate
debate prior to the meet, took a
surprise plan designed to baffle the
opposition; Morris and Smith, fresh-
men, took a new case with them
also.

The “curve ball” plan failed by
a scant margin when Staniar and
Norton were held to a split decision
tie by the Judges in their affirmative
debate; the two who had never de-
bated the negative side before, lost
their negative match.

Morris and Smith outtalked the
Hampden-Sydney debaters by scores
of 37-30 and 31-18. Smith was high
point man for the debates.

Washington and Lee swept top
honors in both categories to defeat
VMI in the second annual W&L-
VMI Speech Night, Tuesday. Elected
representatives of the speech de-
partments of both schools met in the
contests.

Bill Noel took first place in the
original oratory contest and Sandy
Walton won the impromptu speech
category. John Lackey was a close
second to Noell.

Noell, Walton, and Lackey had
been elected by members of the
speech classes to orate in the meet
against the best of VMI. Noell’s sub-
ject was “Beliefs,” Walton’s “Aid

 

| to Vietnam,” and Lackey’s “The Un-

The decision to hold two concerts
was made because of the unusual
theme and has already been approv-
ed by the Faculty Social Functions
Committee.

Both the Dance Board and the
Dance Board Advisory Committee
have already appointed committees
and begun working to make this
year’s Springs “the best ever.”

Several changes and modifications
for Fancy Dress were also announc-
ed after final arrangements had been
made for the use of the Commons.

Costumes Required

The first of these announcements
was concerning dress. All students
must come in full dress, meaning
that they must have costumes. All
girls must wear formals—short or
floor length—but cocktail dresses are
not permissable.

Costume sales ended this after-
noon at 5:00. Although the final
figures on the sales will not be re-
leased until next week, according
to Galef, this year’s sales are “al-
most doubled last year’s.”

A change in Dance Board policy
concerning students coming to
Fancy Dress from other colleges
will permit students wishing to bring
guests to purchase tickets for them
at reduced rates. These will be in
effect until Friday, January 26, and
a student purchasing tickets must
give his guest’s name and _ school
and pay for the tickets at the same
time.

The reduced rates will be $5 for
the concert or $10 for the concert
and both dances. Admission at the
door will be $7.50 for the concert
and $5 for each of the dances. By
purchasing his tickets before Jan-
uary 26, a student may save his
guest $7.50.

Final arrangements for using the
Commons were made yesterday af-
ternoon at a meeting between mem-
bers of the administration and the
faculty and the Fancy Dress Co-
ordination Committee. On the night
of the Fancy Dress Ball, there will
be no parking allowed on either
side of the street in front of the
Commons. The Dance Board urges
all students to co-operate in this
ruling, since having the dance in
the Dining Hall is only on a trial
basis.

Another innovation this year is
that the doors of the Commons will
be locked during the figure, which
will begin at 9:00. All students wish-
ing to see it must be at the dance
before the figure starts.

Fountain Featured

This year’s theme being “High
Society,” the Commons will be dec-
orated as a ball room such as
would be used for an Inaugural
Ball. The decorations will feature
a fountain with circulating water,
large potted plants and other ap-
propriate decorations.

Although there will be no refresh-
ments available in the Commons, the
Co-op will be opened during the
hours of the dance and refreshments
may be purchased there.

Saturday's concert, featuring jazz
personality Dave Brubeck and his
Orchestra will be from 3-5 p.m. The
event will be held in Doremus Gym.
Dress will be conventional.

The Saturday dance with Si Zenter
and his orchestra will be from 8
to 11 p.m. The dress will be semi-
formal. Permission to change the
|dress from formal to semi-formal
| was granted by the Faculty Social
| Functions Committee in December.
| The Saturday dance will be held in
Doremus Gym, and decorations will
be similar to those Friday night. An
| innovation of the Saturday dance
will be tables arranged around the
| dance floor.

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

A Word Of Appreciation

We would like to say a few words of our own in respect
to the recent announcement of Mr. Gilliam’s retirement as
Dean of Students.

Dean Gilliam has inevitably impressed a good deal of his
personal style on the University. We especially hope that the
individual interest he took in every student in the University
will be continued by Dr. Atwood.

Serving as both Dean of Admissions and Dean of Students,
Mr. Gilliam has been in a particularly good position to follow
from the very beginning the career of every student in the
University. He has taken a personal interest in every one of us,
a policy that few other men would attempt, much less carry
off sucessfully. And there are few students at Washington and
Lee who cannot think immediately of several instances when
Dean Gilliam’s interest in, and knowledge of, their own prob-
lems helped them over rough spots in their college careers.

One of the brightest aspects of the Washington and Lee
scene is the warm, friendly atmosphere which prevails on
campus, and the lack of barriers between students and profes-
sors and members of the administration. No single person
connected with Washington and Lee has done more to foster
this attitude than Dean Gilliam. His personal unselfishness has
rendered service to the University in more ways than we feel
fit to appraise. We are delighted that he is staying on as Dean
of Admissions, and we look with confidence to the prospect of
his continued service in that vital post.

Debaters hes Peed Again

Almost unnoticed in the big news of the past week at the
University was the announcement that Washington and Lee
has been invited to join the forensic division of the Atlantic
Coast Conference as an associate member. The invitation is
quite an honor for W&L and a fine testimony to the extraor-
dinary job that Mr. William W. Chaffin has done as coach of
the debate team and as an instructor in public speaking.

Just as any educated man should be able to express himself
clearly and vigorously on his feet, any university worthy of the
name should encourage and honor this quality.

The Ghost Walks

The Interfraternity Conference proposals for the regula-
tion of Hell Week roused the annual ghost again. Once again
debate has broken out on the purpose and methods of Hell
Week.

There is probably no single facet of University life open
to more difference of opinion than this one. Opinions vary
from those old-timers who would like to see paddling of fresh-
men reinstated to those who would like to see all forms of fra-
ternity domination of pledges removed.

 

While the debates have been going on, the relative
difficulty and unpleasantness of Hell Week, and of all pledge
training activities has been decreasing each year.

A number of factors have caused these slight changes,
especially the increasing difficulty of the freshman year aca-
demically, and the growing tendency for students to identify
more closely with the University as a whole than with the fra-
ternities. We can find no fault either with the changing nature
of pledge training or with the attitudes that are causing the
changes.

What the IFC proposals of Monday night amounted to
was an affirmation that they intended to enforce the existing
rules. It certainly should be the ‘“‘duty and prerogative” of the
IFC president, as Bob Doenges termed it, to see that the rules
are enforced.

We have always held that Hell Week tends to draw the
members of the fraternity, and especially each year’s pledge
class, closer together. But it seems to us that Hell Week has
become more and more a meaningless ritual which degrades
both pledges and upperclassmen. The means have been denied
the fraternities to make it really tough—an ordeal that their
freshmen will be proud to have undergone successfully. Each
year there is a good deal of disagreement within each house
over what to do during Hell Week. The resulting arguments
are often bitter, and are almost always carried off by the mi-
nority of “tough” guys, who turn out to be the only men in
the house who care to take the time to work on the freshmen.
The people who want a “Constructive” Hell Week, or Help
Week, in this case, always throw up their hands in disgust and
refuse to have anything further to do with the matter.

Now we hear that the fraternities, in typical fashion, are
rejecting the rather mild IFC proposals for this year. Many
argue that the proposals really do not say anything new.
Though a step in the right direction, they are certainly a dis-
appointment to those people who want to see a more lenient and
constructive Help Week.

It seems to us that the time has come to try a radical solu-
tion to the problem. It’s probably too late for the IFC to come
up with a solution that will receive any support whatsoever
from the fraternities. This year it seems the best the IFC can
do is try to enforce what rules they have now. The fraternities
would do well to try and do what they can within that frame-
work, rather than trying to avoid even these mild sanctions.

Wouldn’t it be a sight, though, if some house had enough
good sense to drop the thing entirely? We wouldn’t miss it.

 

W&L Defeated
In Roanoke
By Missile Gap

By STEVE ALLHENRY

(The following is a sports story
which will undoubtedly appear in
the Ring-tum Phi some time in the
future. We'll call it “A Ring-tum
Phi Sportswriter at the Chess
match.”)

If you’re the kind of person who
likes a heart-stopping, fast-moving,
utterly exhilerating game of chess,
you should have seen last night’s
match between W&L and the Roa-
noke Chess Club.

The taller, more experienced, fast-
breaking, hard-moving Roanokers
finally won out, 5-4, but not until
they had mastered W&L’s fired-up,
inspired and generally exciting Gen-
erals.

W&L jumped into an early lead
when Arnold (Killer) Anderson
flashed exciting strategy to check-
mate Roanoke’s Paul (Horrible)
Johnson in one hour and _ forty
minutes.

But then Roanoke turned on the
old rocket fuel.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Roanoke’s
red-shirt ace Ivan Ilynnn, playing
his usual slashing offensive game,
stopped W&L’s Ike (Old Panther)
Osgood in a stirring two and a half
hour match.

But the Generals rocketed back
on the strength of an awesome dis-
play of defensive prowess by junior
Jerry Pace. He defeated Roanoke’s
Ole Jones to put W&L in a surpris-
ing, unbelievable, wonderful 2-1
lead.

But then, without a trace of warn-
ing, Roanoke went into orbit.

Woosh, zowey, boom, bang, whee,
zot! Roanoke got back-to-back wins
from high scoring lettermen Olaf
Petranovitch and Joe Jones to take
a 3-2 lead.

The best was yet to come, how-
ever.

Crash, bam, yippee. The second
booster on the Roanoke rocket took
over, and two more die-hard, hard-
nosed, outrebrounded and outgun-
ned Generals went down to defeat.

Roanoke’s famed brother combina-
tion, Nicolai and Nicolay Ostravitch,
showed their All-American potential
to W&L’s Billy (Killer II) Martin,
and Bob (Nike I) Black.

The Ostravitch boys put a harras-
sing Queen’s Indian defense up
against Martin and Black, forcing
the W&L duo into repeated mistakes
in their own part of the board.

It was utterly horrible, tragic, and
worst of all depressing when the
stunned crowd of 37,000 packed into
Doremus Gymnasium realized that
Roanoke had put the match out of
reach for the Generals.

Outstanding for the Generals were
Anderson and Pace, mainly because
they both won. However, we are
not saying that their performance
was all good. But it wasn’t all bad,
either.

Besides, winning isn’t important
at W&L, because we are clean, pure,
unravished, refreshing, forward-
stepping, and ingenious.

Woosh!

An Interview With Dr. Phillips

 

A Problem For Conservatives:
Criticizing The Radical Right

By TRACY HARRINGTON

American politics, for most of us,
is a complex and many-sided con-
troversy. The problems of the coun-
try are abundant—economic, diplo-
matic, military and social. And there
are uncontrollable groups that stand
on every possible side of every pos-
sible fence. Most of these groups
will stand primarily on the conser-
vative side or the liberal side, with
occasional rail-hopping on a particu-
lar issue.

One group, however, stands alto-
gether on one side of one fence.
Small in numbers, they make them-
selves heard—and very loudly.

That group is the John Birch
Society. They are the blatant broth-

ers of the frightened right right. To}

them, the sole problem of our society

seems to be the “threat of commun-| :

ism.”

Dr. Phillips, of the economics de-|'-

partment, gave the JBS little power
generally. He did say that the group
was “as much a thorn in the side

of policy and offers no solution ex-
cept name-calling.”

“There are a lot of people con-
cerned about Communism, but they
are concerned about other things
too. Personally, I don’t think the
internal threat of Communism as
bad as they make it out to be.

“Life is too short to become ob-
sessed with a single idea like that.”

Does Dr. Phillips think the John
Birchers have any growing influ-
ence?

Few Would Support JBS

“Few if any college students would
support them,” he said. “The John
Birch Society has become a laugh-

of the Republican Party as the ADA | &

is in the side of the Democratic
Party.”

Famous for Name-Calling

The John Birch Society in an
amazingly short time has gained na-
tional notice. It has accomplished
this chiefly with its now fabled
label of “Communist” to such prom-
inent persons as General Eisenhower,
Milton Eisenhower, Eleanor Roose-
velt and Allen Dulles.”

“This is ridiculous,”
said.

He said he saw no purpose served
“by ealling everybody a Commun-
ist.” He pointed out that the JBS
is “obsessed with one major aspect

Dr. Phillips
The Birchers: A Thorn for the GOP

ing matter with many people. The
president of the group has said that
the membership goal first set of one

 

million seems to him ‘unrealistic’
now.”

Returning to the subject of Gold-
water and the society, Dr Phillips—
who is himself a Republican—said
the JBS “tends to have basically
Goldwater-type conservatism. They
have not come out and said they
supported him for President, but
they probably would support him.
However, they have disagreed with
him on several issues.”

How does Goldwater feel about
JBS?

Dr. Phillips said, “Goldwater has
neither denounced nor supported the
society. All he has said is that
‘there are some good men in it.” 1
don’t think he could support them,
because he is too intelligent a
man.”

Goldwater and the Radicals

As a presidential possibility, Dr.
Phillips doesn’t believe Goldwater
could be elected if he openly sup-
ported the JBS. “He would have no
chance to run for president if he
did.”

About the JBS, ADA, and other
splinter groups in general, Dr. Phil-
lips said, “Very few people could
say they were either Democrats
or Republicans 100% of the time.
You are going to find disagreements
with either party sometime. If you
are satisfied with 50% of a party’s
policies, that is a pretty good aver-
age.”

“Within both parties you will find
factions that don’t ever agree with
the other party and who agree with
the other party less than 50% of the
time. This is where the extremists—
men usually obsessed with one major
issue—come from.”

 

An Analysis Of The Speaking Tradition

By HOWARD SLATER

“To speak or not to speak—Is that

a question?”
(unidentified irate alumnus, circa
class of ’39)

There are many good points which
can be made both for and against
the speaking tradition. This is in-
deed a serious problem since our
social appearances are here at stake.
In general, I am in favor of saying
hello, although with some reserva-
tions. Here are my reasons why:

1. The speaking tradition is a good
thing because it improves a man’s
posture. He must keep his head up
in order to say hello. He cannot
lapse into the tempting habit of
holding the head sideways in imi-
tation of Alexander the Great, and
he cannot keep his head pointed in
the direction of the ground, looking,
no doubt, for cracks in the bases of
our columns. This last does not ap-
ply, however, when one encounters
a less-than-tall member of the stu-
dent body, such as myself, who has

 

to be looked down on.

 

2. The speaking tradition is a good
thing because it strengthens the eye
muscles. Greeting another person
requires one to keep one’s eyes
fixed on one spot—the eyes of the
person he is greeting—despite the
jolting up and down, incident to
one’s natural walking gait. This, of
course, does not apply when one
encounters a fellow student with
Mongoloid features, such as myself,
whose eyes are difficult to distin-
guish from the other facial features.

3. The speaking tradition is also
a good thing because it promotes
perserverance. The theory behind
this, to which I fully subscribe, is
that if one can say hello to those
one cordially dislikes, then one can
endure almost every kind of un-
pleasantry.

4. And finally, but only as a minor
point, the speaking tradition is a
good thing because it promotes an
atmosphere of friendliness and good
will.

Some Reservations

There are, however, a few reserva-

 

From A Fulbright Scholar In France . . .

 

U.S. And French Schools Differ

(Al Broaddus, who graduated from
Washington and Lee last year, is
studying European history and po-
litical science at the University of
Strasbourg in France this year, un-
der a Fulbright scholarship. He
agreed to write articles on the
French scene for the Ring-tum Phi
from time to time during the year.)

By AL BROADDUS

Strasbourg, Jan 6—The university
system in France is, to most Amer-
ican students studying here, a sys-
tem quite different from the one to
which they are accustomed. It is
of course, less than fully accurate
to speak of a “uniform” university
system in the United States, al-
though the word may be validly
applied to what exists in France.
A comparison of student life at
W&L, Ohio State, Columbia, and
West Point should be enough to
make this clear. Nonetheless, Amer-
ican universities hold certain general
traits in common, and it is in this
light that differences between our
own and French student life may
be presented.

There are nineteen universities in
France, including the giant in Paris
(enrollment 100,000), and eighteen in
the provinces. The latter are located
in such major cities as Lyon, Bor-
deaux, and Strasbourg. Each univer-
sity takes the name of the city in
which it is located. They are all state
institutions. An entirely different
view exists in France regarding the
nature and function of a university
from the one prevailing in the

United States. In France, the uni-
versity itself exists, almost solely,
to provide courses and degrees. And
little else. In order to obtain a
degree the student must, at the
end of the year, pass a set of «xami-
nations. This is (in cases of most
degrees) all that is demanded of
the student for the degree.

Academic Progress Ignored

In most cases the university and
faculty are not concerned with the
student’s academic progress during
the semester. (Foreign students
notice the extremely mechanical at-
mosphere in many French classes,
particularly in basic courses. Pro-
fessor enters classroom,
stand up, sit down, professor begins,
students lower heads in note-taking,
class finishes, students rise, profes-
sor and students leave. Questions are
rare.) Thus, in most sections of the
university, there are no_ periodic
quizzes during the semester, com-
pulsory class attendance, etc., al-
though a student may be required
in certain courses to deliver a short
lecture or two. The rigid exami-
nations at the close of the academic
year are considered an adequate
indicator of the student’s ability in
his chosen field.

Thus, from the point of view of
the university itself, there is no
campus or campus life in France, as
we understand these terms in the
United States. There are no housing
or eating facilities offered by the
university. There is limited dormi-

 

tory space available in “cities uni-

students |

 

versitaires,” but these are small, and
usually reserved for the students do-
ing advanced work. Most students
find rooms in private apartments, or
in hotels which cater to them.

French Students Are Unionized

Although there is no campus in
France in the American sense, this
is not to say that there is no student
life. On the contrary, although the
French student is relatively isolated
and independent in contrast to his
American counterpart, there is a
very definite student movement
here. In fact it may be said that stu-
dents in France make up a very dis-
tinct social class, and they are re-
garded as such by others. French
students are unionized, and _ their
national organization is recognized
by the state, which deals with it in
the same fashion it deals with labor
unions. It is through this organiza-
tion that French students have man-
aged to establish several university
resturants in each university city,
serving meals at the equivalent of
22 cents each.

Furthermore, the greater number
of French students, it appears to
me, fall into a fairly uniform po-
litical position—the mean falling
probably rather close to the posi-
tion of the French Socialist Party.
French students are a very definite
political body to be reckoned with.
Much of their political activity is
organized and effectuated through
the medium of the national union.
At present the greater part of this

(Continued on page 4)

 

tions to this favorable conclusion.
In the first place, there are certain
technical difficulties involved in the
mechanics of the speaking tradition.
An extreme instance of this occurs
along the colonnade during the rush
between classes, when it is simply
impossible to greet everyone. There-
fore, the speaking tradition ought to
be supended at those times. Or, as
an alternative, regulations could be
established whereby students walk-
ing in the direction of duPont Hall
will be required to wend their way
thither backwards.

Another alternative would be to
have some of our brethern give in-
structions on how to pass people
with a remote and fishy smile, an
averted eye, and the unspoken hint
that this perhaps is to be construed
as a greeting. Others, who are op-
posed to construing in general, or
who prefer a more manly approach,
can simply ignore this type of greet-
ing which is so much the rage pres-
ently.

Another Doremus?

A second reservation about the
speaking tradition is that it got us
a gymnasium, the demerits of which
are obvious. Perhaps this can be
remedied by a quickie course in
“How to Tell What an Alumnus or
Visitor Will Donate IF One Says
Hello to Him.”

However, there is a third and
most important reason of all for not
wholeheartedly supporting the con-
cept of speaking tradition. This is
that the Assimilation Committee
supports it! It is quite clear to us
us all that Assimilation Committee
members are, in reality, frustrated
throwbacks to the Spanish Inquisi-
tion. An exact description of them
indeed, which makes the speaking

Generals Face —_ Randolph- -Macon Saturday

 

Editorial Cites Advantages
Of New Athletic Conference

(The following editorial, entitled ‘‘A Refreshing Breeze,”
appeared in the Lynchburg Daily Advance on the same day
that the news of the new College Athletic Conference was
announced. )

Today’s announcement of a new—and very different—
kind of organization for intercollegiate sports comes at a time-
ly moment. We’re just getting over a rash of bowl games which
point up, more than any other sports spectacle of the year, all
the evils of commercialization, cheap publicity, big-time gamb-

Fauber, Ide, Paterno
To Lead W&L Attack

After a disappointing loss to Hampden-Sydney, Washing-
ton and Lee’s basketball Generals move back into Doremus
Gymnasium tomorrow night for a game against powerful
Randolph-Macon.

The Yellow Jackets could be the best team to play in Dore-
mus this year, and Coach Bob McHenry’s Generals will have
their hands full holding down a talented group of high scor-

ing R-M veterans.
Veterans has real meaning when*

 

ling, and overemphasis on athletics to which far too many of
our American institutions of higher learning must plead guilty.

 

*

Swimmers Ready
For Georgetown

The Washington and Lee Varsity
swimming team will risk its unde-
feated season tomorrow afternoon
when they play host to Georgetown
University. The meet is scheduled
for 2:30 at the Doremus gymnasium
pool.

Coach Norris Eastman hinted af-
ter time trials on Thursday that pos-
sibly five pool records might be set
in the upcoming meet. Freshman
John Wolfe in both the 220 and 440
yard freestyle, backstroker Mike
Harris, Herb Jahncke in the 200
yard individual medley, and the 400
yard medley relay team have all
come close to existing records this
year.

Last year the tankmen swamped
Georgetown 61-34 but Eastman
warned, “We know nothing about
them and a team can improve a lot
in one year.”

He also pointed out that the
toughest part of the season lies
ahead. The mermen must face swim-
ming powerhouses Maryland and the
University of Pittsburgh and a
strong East Carolina team during the
second half of the season.

 

Referee Calls Paterno
‘Best Frosh’ In Years
To Play For Generals

“He’s the most exciting basketall
player at W&L since Flora.”

That’s how one official who work-
ed the Hampden-Sydney-W&L
basketball game last Tuesday night,
described the Generals’ freshman
guard, Louie Paterno.

Paterno got 17 points against the
tough Tigers in what coach Bob Mc-
Henry called “his best performance
of the year.”

In Paterno and sophomore Tom
Supac, the Generals have one of
the most potent backcourt scoring
combinations in the state.

Supac and Paterno have person-
ally contributed 79 points during the
last two W&L games. Supac hit for
30 against Lynchburg, while Paterno
picked up 13. In the Hampden-
Sydney game, Supac led the Gener-
als with 19.

Paterno, W&L’s first freshman
starter since Bip Fauber arrived in
1959, has been steadily improving all
year. He broke into the starting
line-up with a good performance
against Catholic University.

For some years the leadership of
a tiny minority of our colleges has
seen these evils for what they are,
and has taken forceful action to
eliminate them. One conspicuous ex-
ample is Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, which eight years ago buck-
ed the wrath of a great portion of
its alumni—and students as well—
to withdraw from big-time footbail
and put the game as well as other
sports into proper perspective.

The wisdom of this decision was
slow to be recognized. But in recent
months it has been catching on
and spreading to many other US.
campuses where emphasis has tra-
ditionally resided in academic
achievement and not on conquests
on the athletic field.

Four such schools, binding them-
selves together under a general phil-

osophy of education first, last, and | —

always, are today announcing the
formation of a precedent-shattering
athletic conference to see that this
philosophy is translated into action.

The founding members of what
will be called the College Athletic
Conference and which will become
operational in 1962-63 are W&L,
Centre College, Southwestern of
Memphis, and the University of the
South.

The conference’s Articles of Or-
ganization pinpoint in unequivocal
language the novel ideals and pur-
poses of the league. One cardinal
principle is that “all participation in
sports by members of its teams shall
be solely because of interest in and
the enjoyment of the game...No
financial aid shall be given to any
student which is conditioned upon,
or for the purpose of encouraging,
his participation in intercollegiate
sports. All financial aids of the
member institutions shall be admin-
istered by a single agency of the
faculty. No aid funds shall be spe-
cifiically reserved for athletes, and
the directors of athletics and coaches
shall have no voice or participation
in the determination of recipients or
amounts of financial aid to any stu-
dent. Criteria for admission to the
individual member institutions will
be the same for all students.

Well, that’s as strong an answer
to the promoters, gamblers and to

applied to the Yellow Jackets, be-
cause two of their starters actually
are army veterans, with three years
of service ball under their belts.

Kaminski

In 66” Ralph Kaminiski, the
Jackets have a center that McHenry
calls “one of the state’s outstanding
ballplayers.”

“He does everything well,” said
McHenry. “He’ll kill us underneath
if we give him a chance.”

The other returnee from Uncle
Sam’s leagues is 6’2” Frank Roberts,
who plays equally well at either
forward or guard.

Joining Roberts and Kaminski in
the Jacket starting line-up will be
Billy Allen and Chuck Chambers
at guards, and Tommy Tucker at the
forward opposite Roberts.

6-3 Overall

Randolph-Macon, 6-3 for the year,
opened with five straight wins, and
% was the pre-season favorite in the
, Little Eight.
| For the last two years, the Gener-
als have scored upset wins over the
| Jackets, so it’s a safe bet that R-M
will be plenty up for this one.

McHenry will go with the same
starting five that came up with its
best performance of the year against
Hampden-Sydney Tuesday.

The Tigers pulled out a 76-65
win, which was closer than the 11-
point gap indicates.

activity takes the form of agitation
against the extreme rightist Secret
Army Organization (OAS). A na-
tionwide demonstration against the
OAS was undertaken December 19,
by students in conjunction with the
General Confederation of Workers
and the French Confederation of
Christian Workers, French labor
unions.

One is able to see, therefore, that
while there is no campus in the
American sense in France, so that
the university as a university is not
as distinct, complete, and loyalty-
commanding an influence upon the
student as in the United States,
there exists, nonetheless, a very defi-
nite French student class, more co-
hesive, and more apparent as a dis-
tinct feature of the society than is
the case in the United States.

Behind The News

Dr Charles Phillips, who is inter-
viewed on the editorial page today,
was quoted in the Thursday Wall
Street Journal: “The only solution
to the current labor problem is to
reduce the size of the bargaining
units. Industry wide bargaining is
a hindrance to competitive enterp-
rize, because there is always the
danger of an industry-wide strike.
We must solve this problem first.”

The quote origizally appeared in
an article in the Ring-tum Phi.

In an interview in the Ring-tum
Phi today, Dr. Phillips denounces
the anti-communist radical right.
Dr. Phillip’s quote in the Journal
ironically appeared beneath a quote
by a prominent Communist.

Conformism In France

There is another factor which en-
ters here. This is that, as I suggested
earlier, student life in France, on a
national basis, is highly uniform in
comparison with the United States.
This means that, while there exist
academic differences among the nine-
teen French universities, the life of
the student of any one of them is
likely to be quite similar to that of
his colleagues studying at any of
the others. As a result, the American
student has the advantage, when
selecting a university to attend, not
only of a greater number from which
to choose, but also a greater variety
of types of schools. There would
seem to be one other point in this
connection worth noting. This is,
given that the American student is
so often criticized for his tendency
to conform to a dictated style of
thinking and living, the same obser-
tion must be made regarding stu-
dents here.

Something that seems to be of
interest to many people is whether
European students work harder than
American students, or are “more
serious” than American students.
There is a greater emphasis here,
it seems, on following a large num-
ber of classes. Many students here
take some 30-35 hours of classes each
week. There is probably less work
to be done outside for each one of
these classes, however. Often as-
signments are more flexible here, so
that a great deal depends, without
doubt, on what the student chooses
to read, etc. Let me point out that
these observations are based on my
own experience with a limited num-
ber of classes.

While it is probably accurate to
state that French students are, per-
haps, politically a bit to the left of
their American counterparts, they
are socially more conservative. Re-
gardless of what the local yellow
journals may say, among students
here the cha-cha continues to pre-
vail over le tweest.

though, that Adenauer was “softened
up” somewhat by Washington in his
attitude toward this problem.

“IT Don’t Want War”

As a guide for the future Nagy
asked, “Would Sukarno be brave
enough to threaten New Guinea, or

| Kassem threaten Kuwait if the Unit-

ed States had fought for Eastern
Europe?”

“T don’t want war,” Nagy empha-

PIONEERING

Somewhere out there, beyond the realm of man’s present
understanding, lies an idea. A concept. A truth.

Gradually, as it comes

disciplined minds, it will become clear, refined,

under the concentration of
mas-

tered. This is the lonely art of pioneering.

In the Bell System, pioneering often results in major
breakthroughs. Planning the use of satellites as vehicles
for world-wide communications is one, Another is the
Optical Gas Maser, an invention which may allow a
controlled beam of light to carry vast numbers of telephone
calls, TV shows, and data messages.
