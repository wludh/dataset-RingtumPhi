first of the year.

Geerge Honts, a Delt senior from| ing editor of the Ring-tum Phi last
a| year. He has been secretary of the|
senior representative also. He is! Assimilation Committee, and was as-!

Tom Rains.
Rains, a KA junior, from Atlanta,

 

Omicron Delta Kappa honored the seventeen outstanding
campus leaders today in the Forty-Seventh Annual Tap Day

Ceremony.

One faculty member and three alumni were also tapped at

the yearly event.

Speaking at the noon-hour convocation was Dr. Joseph C.
Robert, Professor of History at the University of Richmond
and former president of Hampden-Sydney College.

Dr. Robert, brother-in-law of Washington and Lee Chan-

cellor Francis P. Gaines, spoke

ship in the Southern tradition.

Without denying the shortcomings
of the Old South, and specifically
rejecting any “curtain of white
columns” to check free interplay of
ideas and information, Dr. Robert
urged the students to draw from
the experiences of the South and
the idess of responsible leadership.
He indicated that if Virginia had
followed the spirit of liberalism
and accommodation present in Rock-
bridge County perhaps there would
have been no Civil War.

In the course of his remarks he
reviewed the grand and extensive
academic tradition to which they
were heirs. Dr. Robert especially

x emphasized the distinctive quality of
the liberal arts in an independent
institution, the spirit of which spills
over into the professional schools.
As to the world outlook he rejected
the idea of inevitable decline, see-
ing in the new leadership reasons
for hope.

Omicron Delta Kappa, with chap-
ters at most of the leading univer-
sities and colleges of the nation.
was founded at Washington and Lee
in 1914 as an honorary leadership
fraternity.

The seventeen students, one facul-
ty member, and three alumni tapped
are as follows:

Success, Not Age, Gives W&L Traditions Their Value

Editor’s note: The following article
was was written for the Tuesday Edition
by a man who has long been a true
friend of Washington and Lee. Dr. L. J.
Desha, who is both a graduate and Pro-
fessor of Chemistry here, has kindly
consented to write an article on the “Tra-
ditions of Washington and Lee.” We feel
that Dr. Desha’s observations and com-
ments are, indeed, worthy of considera-
tion by the Student Body.

By DR. L. J. DESHA
Professor of Chemistry
Mr. Robert R. Goodwin, II
Editor
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Dear Mr. Goodwin,

Thank you for your recent invitation
to contribute an article on the “Tradi-
tions of Washington and Lee.” I under-
stand that it is your purpose to publish
a series of reviews continuing what Pro-
fessor Coulling began so very ably in his

Che King-tum Phi

discussion of the Honor System. This is
a purpose to which any loyal alumnus
would be glad to contribute to the ex-
tent of his capacity.

Doubtless your choice fell on me as one
who appears to have been a part of
Washington and Lee, as student and pro-
fessor, for a longer span than anyone else
now living. As such, you probably count-
ed upon receiving some history of the
origins and development of these tra-
ditions.

Here, however, I must fail you; for,
when I first stepped upon campus, in
September 1903, I found the same
Honor System, the same habit of con-
ventional dress, and the same “speaking”
tradition which are here today. Perhaps
that statement of fact—“eye-witness” tes-
timony, if you will—is, in itself, of no
mean significance.

If, leaving now this period of per-
sonal observation, I may speculate
upon the origins of these traditions in

a more distant past I would state a
very difinite conviction. This is that
they all evolved—let us stress the
word evolved, for certainly, none of
them could have sprung up full
fledged, over night—it is my convic-
tion that all of our traditions evolved
from the fundamental concept that
Washington and Lee men are gentle-
men.

Gentlemen do not cheat, they do not lie,
they do not steal—hence, the Honor Sys-
tem. Gentlemen have pride of person;
they realize that they owe it to them-
selves even more than to others to be
personally clean, well groomed, present-
able—thus conventional dress. Gentlemen
are polite; they are considerate not only
of the rights but the feelings of others;
fellow members of an association of
gentlemen speak when they meet.

Naturally I have seen many changes
over the past nearly sixty years but all
these are superficial, non-essential. The

quadrupling of the student body over the
300 of my freshman year has called for
minor differences in the administrative
procedures of the Honor System; funda-
mentally, it remains what it was when
I sat on a student jury in old Tucker
Hall when an accused had demanded a
public trial.

The “conventional” dress of 1903, if
reproduced now, would be as uncon-
ventional as are the brass head lamps
of a 1903 Olds. As to speaking I am
not sure that in that earlier day we
had learned to say, “Hi, gentlemen”;
certainly, “Hello” was not so preva-
lent then, when one could—and usu-
ally did—greet a fellow student by his
name or, more probably, nick name.
Again, the differences are among in-
essentials; the fundamentals of good
manners are dateless, however they
may vary.

Let no one mistake me to hold that

anything is worth while merely be-
cause it is old. The value for the
Washington and Lee traditions lie not
in their age but in the fact that they
have worked—and still work. Living as
gentlemen has made this campus a pleas-
ant and satisfying place in which to spend
four years of development for life.

It has done much to produce the re-
spect and regard which Washington and
Lee alumni customarily command in their
communities. Less important, but certain-
ly not to be despised, it has produced a
campus atmosphere which wins the praise
of countless visitors.

And who can doubt but that the ob-
servance of these traditions is weightily
responsible for the nation-wide recog-
nition of Washington and Lee as a “pres-
tige” institution?

Thank you again, Mr. Editor, for your
invitation to express these ideas.

Sincerely yours,
L. J. DESHA, ’06

A Refreshing Attitude

From Executive Committee

It is encouraging to see that Washington and Lee’s Execu-
tive Committee is cognizant of the importance of strong re-
lations with both the campus media and with the Student Body
as a whole.

By voting to provide a chart showing the proposals and the
vote of each of the EC members, the Executive Committee has
realized that it owes to the students who elected them to office
an active reporting of their government’s actions.

 

In their meeting held last Tuesday night, the Executive
Committee voted also to give press representatives a chance to
question members as to certain proposals under study by the
Student governmental leaders.

Their vote to hold meetings on Mondays in order to utilize
both of the editions of the Ring-tum Phi is also an encouraging
step in the line of better government for the Student Body.
As was pointed out in Friday’s paper, their meeting on Mondays
will allow the Ring-tum Phi to report results of the Executive
Committee the next day. Heretofore, this year, there existed
a three-day lapse between the meetings and the newspapers’
reporting of those meetings.

The Tuesday Edition wishes to go on record as hailing
these steps taken by the EC as moves which will benefit the
Executive Committee in the fulfillment of its obligations to the

Student Body.

A Promising Enthusiasm

Now that the bands and musicians have all been contracted
for this year’s Fancy Dress Weekend, the next step would seem
to lie in student support of the Dance Board’s work.

The social chairmen of the 18 fraternities, we are happy to
report, have agreed to support the Dance Board’s actions by
limiting the times that combos will start at the houses. It is also
encouraging to note that the group which Steve Galef called
together passed a resolution which states the “fraternities are
aware of the problems that exist and are willing to work for a
compromise to solve these problems.”’

From the way that the sale of costumes has been going, we
think this, in itself, is indicative of student support for the
dance weekend.

The Ball, which is to be held in the Commons, should
prove, indeed, to be the year’s biggest event socially.

It is also our understanding that the Dance Board Advisory
Council is working according to plans, and we can note that this,
too, seems encouraging.

Perhaps, with a little luck, Fancy Dress this year really will
be the ‘‘South’s outstanding college social event.” We hope
so, at any rate.

A New Responsibility

With the announcement in last night’s EC meeting of the
appointment of 5 men to the newly organized Student Control
Committee, we feel that a new era in student responsibility has
been ushered into Washington and Lee life.

These men, each of whom will have to assume a great deal
of responsibility themselves, are well-qualified and are students
who would seem to have the best interests of Washington and
Lee at heart.

The selection of these members, however, is not the last
step to be taken. Student support and student respect will be a
prerequisite to the Committee’s success, and we hope that
the Student Body realizes this basic assumption.

As we said earlier this year, the faculty has placed a tre-
mendous amount of trust in student hands by their giving
support to this Committee. Again, we urge the students not to
betray this trust and this responsibility.

 

ODK speaker, Dr. J. C. Robert told the student body today
of the Southern tradition of leadership at the ODK Assembly.

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Since there are still nine shop-
ping days left until the last shop-
ping day before
Christmas, it’s
really not time to
start discussing
Christmas present
buying. But since
this is my last
column before the
holidays, and also
since I’ve just got-

 

ten my annual

“ Christmas club
Craven check from the
TB Society of
Lexington-Buena Vista, it seems

that it might be appropriate to dis-
cuss this sort of thing right now.

But, my family subscribes to the
Ring-tum Phi (although they seldom
get it), and I don’t want to let any
cats out of any bags. So I’m going
to turn my attention to what I feel
is one of the greatest problems of
this University.

I'm doing this now so everybody
will do what they can in the next
few days, and then return in the
new year determined to correct the
situation as it now stands. The situa-
tion I refer to is the definite lack
and continuing decline in partici-
pation in non-collegiate extra-cur-
ricular activity.

Being in the Class of 1962, which
is the very last of the un-Commons
classes, I have been a witness to the
slow death of several venerable
Lexington institutions. These insti-
tutions are by no means dead, but
if something isn’t done by the non-
serious before the year is out then
next year the only support they re-
ceive will be from five-year men and
law students.

I’m referring, of course, to the
theatres of the town. Some of you,
especially freshmen, are unaware

that the town has two such places
of business, and I’m positive there
are some that don’t know there is
even one. I’ve tried, Mr. Side and
Mr. Daves can testify to that, to get
you guys going to the fiicks, but
every day it seems like only the
dozen or so regulars, and two old
ladies, are there. I understand that
a lot of people use the afternoons
as nap time—but this does not ex-
cuse you from going to the movies.
Sack from 4 to 6 is much better after
a bad movie, or even a good one like

 

“T Women From Hell.” So get out
there, men, to the movies; they’re
worse than ever, but so much better
than no entertainment at all.

If you offer money as an excuse
for not going, o.k., but you must then
look for cheaper fun, with an eye
toward maximum time wasted.

WEL Flick Teams Are Faltering;
Let’s Waste Time, Go To More Movies

For lack of things to do in Lex-
ington most people seem to be
studying. This is unhealthy. But so
is doing nothing, so the answer is
to do as much as you can while ac-
complishing nothing. I’ve found my-
self that jig-saw puzzles are pretty

Former Sports Editor Comments on De-Emphasization

Editor’s Note: The following letter
was sent to Mr. A. G. Skelley of
Sports Illustrated. A copy of the
letter was sent to the Ring-tum Phi
for publication.

Dear Mr. Skelly:

Your article on the success of
Washington and Lee’s de-empha-
sized football team was outstanding.
I want to congratulate you and
Washington and Lee.

However, you mentioned that in
1955 there was great pressure to re-
turn to big-time football. You said
campus polls favored it. As author
of this poll and sports editor of
the college newspaper at the time, I
would like to correct this statement.

We were not interested in return-
ing to big-time football. What we
suggested, and a copy of the poll will
verify this, was that amateur ath-
letics be retained but that a more
active interest be taken by the Uni-
versity and the board of trustees. We
emphasized the need for recruiting
on an amateur basis, among prep
schools and high schools to attract
good football players who were cap-
able of holding their own academi-
cally.

The results of our poll indicated
68 per cent of the student body and
faculty favored this action. With
the hiring of Lee McLaughlin in
1956, the University actually em-
barked on a program similar to that
suggested by the results of the poll.

We appealed for this action and are
extremely gratified with the present
results and feel the present Wash-
ington and Lee athletic policy is, in
part, a result of our efforts.

I feel that many schools, large or
small, would benefit from similar ac-
tion. You will notice that several
schools similar in size to Washington

and Lee, are now starting such an
athletic policy.

The entire national collegiate ath-
letic picture would be a great deal
brighter and could be freed from its
recent gambling and_ recruiting
blights if more schools would em-
bark on an athletic program similar
to Washington and Lee,

Sincerely yours,
EDGAR L. GROVE

“Precisely the same techniques are*

of three big PR
agencies to handle
advertising and
public relations
for the new Unit-
ed States Travel
Service. The firm’s
mission is to urge
travelers to come
here and to re-
move the doubts
that have, hereto-
fore, kept them
away.

If this mission was to be the ex-
tent of it then I could laugh and
say that America is going down to
Puerto Rico’s level, who is, as the
reader knows, currently being por-
trayed in various slick magazines
as an island paradise. However, to
go about selling tourists the agen-
cies must sell America.

 

Ketcham

To sell America, or to sell any-
thing for that matter, requires
working into and out of the “image
problem.” The agencies, in trying
to sell America must, necessarily,
delve into the realm of political
propaganda, Perhaps that is one
of Madison Avenue’s subtle aims,
but whatever it is, it certainly
raises matters both of increased
magnitude and different in kind
from the narrowly defined objec-
tive of selling a certain soap.

What is the definition of “selling
America”? Does it mean the adop-
tion of a conscious sales technique?
I am afraid that it does. A few
years ago Arthur Larson, author of
Modern Republicanism, and Dean of
Duke’s School of Law, spoke here at
W&L on the need for a positive ap-
proach in our relations with other
nations, a worked out idealogy rath-
er than the Great Haphazard we
usually practice.

Mr. Larson made a good point. I
do not think for a moment, however,
that he was thinking along the lines
propounded by PR. The United
States stands for truly great things
such as birth in revolution, love of
freedom and concern for one’s fel-
low man. I submit that it is not
possible to patently “sell” these
concepts.

It is often emphasized that we
as Americans are competing for
the minds of men. Is this really our
aim? America stands for freedom,
and this idea connotes our con-
cern for other peoples to be free
and to do as they will. It does not
mean that those persons in other
countries must ape us or do ex-
actly as we ourselves, but rather
that we as a nation are opposed to
controls being put on them either
by a dictatorship or totalitarian
government,

Alongside the notion that we are
competing for men’s minds comes
the idea of ethno-centraism. This is
the feeling, if I can state it simply,
| that what you have is better than

Terry Fohs was named by the
Associated Press as second team
center on their Little All-American
squad. Steve Suttle, Charley Gum-
mey, Bob Payne and Tommy Good-
win, other members of the unde-
feated Generals, received honorable
mention.

Washington and Lee was the
only college in Virginia to land a
player on the first or second team.

Terry was also named by the Vir-

outstanding football players in the
state for the 1961 season.

Coach Mac Praises

Coach Lee McLaughlin says about
Terry, “His consistancy is amaz-~
ing...he missed only part of one
game because of injury in four years
of hard play. I have never seen a
player with greater courage and it
will be impossible to replace him at
W&L,” added Coach Mace about the

tercollegian Wrestling tournament
this Friday and Saturday at Chat-
tanooga.

This will mark the first time
since W&L’s withdrawal from the
Southern Conference that the
General squad has participated in
a tournament.

Although the exact number of
schools in the tournament hasn’t
been determined yet, invitations
have been extended to such schools
as Lehigh, Auburn, The Citadel,
Alabama, Georgia, Davidson, Duke,
Sewanee, and Oklahoma State.

 

Individual contestants will be
ceded according to their overall
collegiate record, and the tourney
will be run on a one elimination
basis.

Saturday, the Franklin and Mar-
shall wrestlers squelched a General
comeback staged by Dick Albert
and Jud Babcock who put together
back-to-back wins, and prevailed
15-9. The final outcome was decided
in the unlimited bout in which the
F&M heavyweight edged Bob Pa-
gano, 7-4.

Stover Wins

The most decisive General win of
the evening was freshman Tom
Stover’s 9-2 victory in the 137-lb.
class.

 

Mermen Swamp Norfolk; Tie William And Mary

Washington and Lee’s swim-
ming team emerged with a win
and a tie from their weekend
meets with Norfolk William

and Mary and W&M in Wil-

liamsburg.

The Mermen topped Nor-
folk W&M 61-34 Friday night
and then tied W&M the next
afternoon, 43-43.

Against Norfolk the Generals
were led by victories from John
Lundy in the 220, Jim Wearn in
the 50, and Mike Harris in the 200
backstroke. W&L also took the
medley relay and the 400-yd. free
style relay. Diver Bruce Houghten
put in what Coach Norris East-
man called “his best effort so far

 

this season,” to capture second
place in the diving event.

Lundy also won the 440 free-style,
Jim Wallenstein took the 200 breast-
stroke event, and Jahncke won the
100-yd. free-style. |

The W&M meet the following af-
ternoon produced a rarity in swim-
ming: a tie. The Generals again
won the medley relay, and Cap-
tain Elliott Maynard turned in his

The Wasps, urged on by a wild
crowd, which appeared to be seek-
ing blood for E&H’s football loss to
W&L, grabbed the lead for good
with 7:30 left in the half on a pair
of free throws by Larry Nave.

From there on out it was a mat-
ter of how much Emory could add
to its margin. The Wasps threw
up every kind of shot imaginable
and most of the wierd ones went
in. One shot hit the rim bounced
straight up nearly to the top of
the backboard, hit the rim again,
bounced up again, and finally fell
through.

Guard Louis Paterno and captain
Bip Fauber paced a_ second-half
General surge that kept W&L within
breathing distance of the Wasps un-
til late in the game.

Defeat, coupled with a 55-54 loss
to Catholic U. last Saturday dropped
the Generals’ record to 1-3.

F&M Friday

W&L’s next game is Friday against
Franklin and Marshall at 8 p.m. at
Doremus Gymnasium.

Emory placed five men in double
figures, headed by guard Bill Troy’s
19. W&L’s scoring leaders were
Fauber with 15 and Paterno and Jon
Supak with 11 points each.

Led by 6-4 Footsie Brown’s 21
rebounds, the Wasps dominated the
boards over the shorter Generals.
Fauber paced W&L with 19.

The Generals look much more im-

 

pressive in their one-point loss to; until Paterno put the Generals one-

the Catholic Cardinals Saturday.

Down 27-21 at halftime, W&L
staged a roaring comeback. A
jump shot by Fauber with 8:16
left tied the score at 44-44. Then
the Generals’ Mr. Everything put
W&L ahead 46-44 with a long
jump shot.

The lead swayed back and forth

up at 54-53 with a driving lay-up.

But Lady Luck smiled the other
way as Catholic guard Gene Horan
fired a 15-foot jumper with 0:25 left
to clinch the win for the Cardinals.

Paterno Top

Paterno paced the Generals’ score-
| ing with 13 points. Ide got 11, Fauber,
ten.

 

Baby Generals Squash Fishburne;
Face Tough Staunton Here Next

The Baby General _ basketball
team won over a small, outclassed
Fishburne five 69-30 yesterday in
Doremus gym.

Livingston Gets 19
Led by Dick Livingston’s 19
points W&L was never seriously
challenged. Madison with 12 points
and Kowalski with 13 markers also
helped the scoring.

Coach Lyles used most of his

bench in the game and during the

second half tried out different of-

fenses and defenses with his squad.

High man for Fishburne with 9
points was Steve Utley.

SMA Next

The Baby Generals are shooting
for the game with Staunton Military
Academy, top ranked in state mili-
tary schools. W&L meets them here

Time-Wasting Is The Only

Faltering Tradition Here

good for this, especially if you throw
away ten or twelve pieces before you
start.

You can get puzzles with pieces
already missing at the Opportunity
Shop for a dime—and I guarantee
at least six hours of fun.

People with a good background
in puzzles should try working them
upside down—or in the dark.

Another thing I can recommend
for adept students is model air
planes—build them, paint them, hang
them from the ceiling, then shoot
them down with a BB gun.

If you don’t have any motivation
about you at all, then watch TV or
something, but for the University’s
sake start wasting some time. Take
the above suggestions and mold them
to your own needs. (If you have
a roommate, playing jackrocks is
fun but your hands get very dirty.

After Christmas Ill go into sug-
gestions about going over the hill
and down the road, but start now on
your individual time-wasting. Then
as exams approach I'll be sure to
point out advantages and disadvant-
ages of each room in the Library.

But before the remainder of the
week—get busy, do nothing. Re-
member the P.E. Department’s slo-
gan: “Budget your time wisely—
leave some time to waste.”

McThenia Issues Statement

McThenia issued a statement con-
cerning the committee, which said
that, “It is the opinion of the
Executive Committee that these men
are well qualified. It is also be-
lived that they will be of great
service to the University.”

“It is hoped,” he said, “that
students will support the Control
Committee, and that the Student
Body won't betray the trust the
faculty has shown in W&L’s stu-
dents.” (See Editorial on Page 2.)

In other business last night, Stu-
dent Body Secretary Steve Suttle
reported that his sub-committee has
completed work on the proposed re-
forms to the Constitution. He said
that the text of these reforms will
be released after Christmas vacation.

Two complete constitutions, he
reported, have been received along
with several individual proposed
amendments to the Constitution.

 

What Will Be The Result
Of Advertising America?

(Continued from page 2)

what others have. This idea is
equally prevelant in either the sell
America concept or the Christian
missionary effort. That is to say,
there is something naive and over-
simplified in attempting to trans-
plant ideas nurtured at home to a
different climate and soil.

The hiring of three agencies
has opened the door to Washing-
ton. As the president of one big
agency says: “the travel drive will
open the way for the large scale
intervention of the advertising
profession in the cold war. This is
what we must subtly work to-
ward.”

It is clear that these men, who
have long hoped for an inroad to
Washington, will be pressing on
now that they have their feet in.

The possibility of greater influence
by Madison Avenue is objectionable.
There is the simple matter of money.
The current lobby is seeking some-
thing like a multi-million dollar ap-
propriation for the travel campaign.
Another cloud rises over the in-
creased hodgepodge of bureaucracy.
Government must go on and all that,
but to create additional arms with
such growth potential only gums
things a bit more.

The cat is out of the bag and
everyone is in the courtyard. To be
concerned about our country, to wish
to help and to believe that those
skills practiced in one area will work
equally well in another is only
natural.

But mix PR with The Image, prop-
aganda, ideas cherished by men,
and Washington; just what does re-
sult?
