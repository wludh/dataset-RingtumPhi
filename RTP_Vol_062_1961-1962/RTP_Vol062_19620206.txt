Washington and Lee frater-
nities began their formal Help
Week activities yesterday
morning as the final part of
their pledge training programs

for the year.

In contrast with years past, the
week’s work is supposed to center
‘ mainly around community service
and house improvement projects as
a result of the new Help Week pro-
posals passed by the Interfraternity
Council three weeks ago.

Sunday Meeting

IFC president Bob Doenges met
with all fraternity house presidents
and pledgemasters on Sunday eve-
ing to discuss in detail the new pro-
posals and how they would be en-
forced, and then the group reviewed
the general rules that have been
used in former years.

The new proposals provide that
“no individual should be forced
to perform deeds that violate his
basic sense of human dignity and
decency.”

In addition, a revolving trophy
will be awarded to the pledge class
“achieving the most constructive
service for their fraternity, and
community, and University.”

To Visit Houses

Doenges and Steve Rutledge, Phi
Gam senior, who has headed a
committee for the study of Help
Week program proposals, will make
frequent visits at each of the 18
fraternity houses on campus during
the week to inspect the Help Week
activities.

The new interest in community
service is reflected by the variety
of projects planned by several fra-
ternities.

Some of these projects include
aiding the staff of McCormick
Library, painting Dr. Fishwick’s
house, assisting in the local March
of Dimes campaign, and helping
a semi-invalid resident of Rock-
bridge County.

In addition to this, many of the
fraternities will be repainting and, in
general, cleaning up the interior and
exterior of the houses.

 

28 Students Withdraw
Under Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Automatic
Rule has announced the withdrawal
of 28 students from the University
because of academic failure.

Included in this total
freshmen, 16 sophomores
juniors and seniors.

Last year, a total of 34 students
withdrew after the first semester.
Of this number 22 were freshmen
and 12 were upperclassmen.

The committee is composed of the
President of the University, the
deans of the Arts and Sciences
School, the Commerce School, the
Law School, as well as the Dean of

Most of the fraternities will also
have some of the former projects for
their pledges. A few houses require
gunny-sack underwear, others have
certain definitions and _ sayings
pledges must repeat, and, of course,
there will be the traditional KA log.

The official end of Help Week is
10:00 Friday night, and most of
the fraternities will initiate their
pledges sometime during the week-
end.

a few days ago that he was general-
ly impressed with Washington and
Lee University.

The Irish author, who recently re-
turned to his home in Killney, Ire-

Five New Students Enroll
At Washington and Lee

Five new students have enrolled
at Washington and Lee for the sec-
ond semester, it was announced to-
day by the Dean’s Office.

The only new sophomore to regis-
ter was Douglas W. Bell, a transfer
from Dartmouth.

New freshmen are Marshall Dan-
iels, a freshman here last fall; Wil-
liam French Skinner, Jr., a second
semester transfer from VPI; Julius
Peter Winfield, a transfer from the
University of Oklahoma. Elwood
Dean is registered as a special stu-
dent, and he attended Bridgewater.

Returning students are Austin C.
Bray; Michael M. Cenci; Richard H.

value of a ticket to a job even as a
door-to-door salesman,” he said.

Speaking of the Washington
and Lee campus, he said that “the
students differed from students at
other colleges by wearing col-
lars and ties. They dressed formal-
ly, like gentlemen.”

“Tn a class of 23 students,” he said,
“IT learned that not one of them had
ever seen a stage play beyond what
they put on at their own little
theater.”

In a closing statement, O’Faolain
said the following about American
education:

“The cardinal virtue in America
is “thou shalt work” and that is
wrong. They work too hard and too
long and miss the pleasure that
knowledge can give.”

MacDonald
To Talk Here
On Far East

John E. MacDonald, the State De-
partment’s chief of research for
Southeast Asia, will speak to stu-
dents at Washington and Lee Fri-
day (Feb. 9) concerning recent de-
velopments in Viet Nam and other
Southeast Asian countries.

MacDonald’s remarks are sched-
uled for 11:10 a.m. in Newcomb Hall.
Although two University political
science classes will hear the Far East
specialist as a part of their regular
study program, MacDonald’s talk
will be open to the general public.

MacDonald, who is on a short lec-
ture visit of area colleges, will talk
to students at Virginia Military In-
stitute Friday afternoon at 2 p.m.

He is a native of New Hampshire,
graduated from Yale in 1935, and
joined the Department of State in
1945. Chief of research for Southeast
Asia since July, 1961, MacDonald
is expert in his knowledge of the
Chinese language and he has held
various other positions in the de-
partment and with Foreign Service
in the Far East.

Number 29

Professor Mahomed Krader Nawaz, Visiting Associate
Professor in the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs
at the University of Virginia will speak at W&L’s International
Relations Week on Thursday, the 15th of February, at 7:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel. Mr. Nawaz will join Senator Albert Gore,
of Tennesse, whose address will open the program on the

13th of February.

The title of Professor Nadaz’s*

lecture will be, “The United Nations
at Crossroads.” He has stated he
will emphasize the attitudes Amer-
ican citizens should take toward
the United Nations in its struggle for
success in maintaining world peace,
attitudes which will be consistent
with his view that “The United
Nations without strong support
from the United States would be
like a production of Hamlet without
the Prince of Denmark.”

Professor Nawaz took his bacca-
laureate degree at Andhra Univer-
sity, in India, and he took both
bachelor’s and masters degrees in
law in Madras University, gaining
first rank in both examinations. He
practiced the profession of law in
Madras, and he has served as sec-
retary to a member of the Indian
Parliament. He is currently on leave
from a Research Fellowship in In-
ternational law at the Indian School
of International Studies.

Mr. Nawaz has published numer-
ous studies on international law and
international organization in the
Indian Journal, International Studies
and in the Indian Yearbook of Inter-
national Affairs.

International Relations Week was
first begun in 1953-54 under the
direction of Dr. Harvey Wheeler,
professor of political science, now
on leave to the Center for the Study
of Democratic Institutions.

The week is intended to stimulate
interest in international affairs
among the student body through
the presentation of excellent speak-
ers in the field.

In the past years the week has
featured such figures as Arnold
J. Toynbee; Norman Thomas; Paul
Hoffman, Director of the United
Nations’ Special Fund; and Arthur
Larson, Director of the World
Rule of Law Center at Duke Uni-
versity.

Albert Gore,

Senator Democrat

from Tennessee, will be the prin-
cipal speaker this year.

He will speak at the opening ses-
sion of the two-day series of talks
in Lee Chapel on Tuesday evening,
February 13 at 7:30,

Mr. Gore’s appearance on the
campus will mark the first time
that a member of the United
States Senate has spoken for In-
ternational Relations Week

W&L’s Dean F. J. Gilliam:
A Guardian Of Heritage

Editor’s Note: The following editorial was written by
Nathan P. B. Simpson, editor of the Friday Ring-tum Phi
last year, at the request of the Tuesday Edition. The feelings
expressed in his editorial, are, we feel, of significance at this
time,

On February first, a beloved servant of Washington and
Lee took leave of the office and title of Dean of Students.

Each of us who has enjoyed association with the University
during Frank J. Gilliam’s administration as dean will remember
this man in so far as we have felt the healthy influence he has
exerted upon our lives.

Perhaps we will remember him as the persuasive salesman
tirelessly canvassing our prep or high school and telling us of
the merits of a Washington and Lee education.
On the other hand, we may remember him as
an impartial, frank and forceful counselor,
whose guidance was informed by an under-
standing of the merits of the alternative po-
sitions in our conflict. Or we might remember

   

wet >
ies im —
Gilliam

He was there at

all he could for

him as a stern, yet somehow compassionate
disciplinarian, sympathetic and always willing
to give a student another chance.

We may recall him as the energetic and
aggressive worker behind the scenes in student
affairs whose aid and time we desperately
solicited and he generously gave. It might
have been the time we were sick or injured
and in a hospital in Lexington, Roanoke, or
Richmond when we best remember this man.
any hour comforting our parents and doing
us. We might just remember him as a person

stately in bearing who could always call our names as we passed
him on the colonnade.

Whatever our impressions and memories of this man, we
all know that his care and concern reached out to all of us.
Our problems sooner or later became his problems, and our
sorrows or joys were his also. His life of dedication has been an
inspiration for countless Washington and Lee students and as
his tasks at the university lessen, W&L will feel its loss.

We as students and alumni can watch with pride

Washing-

ton and Lee’s promise become a reality of progress and achieve-
ment, but in my opinion our institution’s greatest asset is not

its superstructure of new accomplishments, but its foundation
of tradition and dedication. A person who has stood firm on this

foundation as a

guardian of Washington and Lee’s heritage

and whose life has been dedicated to the ideals of this institu-

tion is Dean Frank J. Gilliam.

Many of the memories which are born of four years of
undergraduate work at Washington and Lee are destined to be
erased by an erosion of time or replaced by new experiences,
but there will always be a few indelible impressions which will
not leave us. The life of this man and his association with each

of us 1S such an impression.

King’s Rejection
Tops News Stories
\f First Semester

By BOB HOLLAND
Staff Writer

Dissention over the rejection of a proposed appear-
ance by a controversial Negro spokesman, an unde-
feated football season, and a whipped college bowl
quiz team were the highlights of what has been an
unusually news-worthy semester at Washington and
Lee University this year.

The announcement of the formation of a new ath-
letic conference that will include W&L, a shift in the
top University administration, the newly-organized
student control discipline committee, and another
state championship for W&L’s fine debate team also
would have to be ranked close to the top of any list
of leading news stories emanating from this college.

In this reporter’s opinion, however, the Martin
Luther King controversy lead the way by a wide
margin in campus happenings. The initial announce-
ment by the university Board of Trustees that Rev.
King would not be allowed to speak at a seminar
here on Christian ethics ignited a spark of dissent
that found both the students and faculty lodging
protests against what they considered an infringe-
ment of academic freedom.

Perhaps (again, in the opinion of this reporter)
rejection of the request that Rev. King speak at
the university may have salutary results in the
long run. The decision was not calmly accepted
on the campus as is the case in all too many in-
stances at this university. The realization that
freedom to hear divergent opinion was being
threatened stimulated a spontaneous protest that
may give more meaning to the theory of academic
freedom at this university in years to come.

In the field of W&L sports there was strictly “no
contest” in consideration of the leading news story.
The undefeated football team of coach Lee M. Mc-
Laughlin wins hands down.

The non-subsidized, or as daily newspapers are
accustomed to say, the “simon-pure” team of the
university once again proved that good football
can be played without paying money for hired hands.
Thus, the victories on the playing field can justly

Res Ipsa Loquitur

 

be translated into another kind of victory for the
Washington and Lee administration and coaching
staff—a “moral” victory.

While the Washington and Lee athletic teams were
racking up victory after victory, a team of univer-
sity scholars found the going a bit rough on a na-
tion-wide quiz program. Facing opponents that had
won four contests in a row on the College Quiz Bowl,
the university team of Bill Lowry, Tom Lybass, Jim
Campbell, and Rick Anderson were eliminated in
their first try.

Another encouraging aspect of the first semester
was faculty approval of the Student Control
Committee. The duty of this new group will be to
investigate and take appropriate action on con-
duct offenses reported te it by the university
proctor, the administration of neighboring insti-
tutions, or the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent body.

The committee represents a heartening advance
toward the ideal of considerable self-government by
the Washington and Lee student body.

A recent news story of merit concerned the top-
level change in the university administration. Dr.
Edward C. Atwood, Jr., a former associate profes-
sor of economics at Washington and Lee, will return
to the university as Dean of Students. He will assume
some of the duties of Dean Frank J. Gilliam. Gilliam,
Dean of Students since 1931, who will continue to
serve as Dean of Admissions.

Not to be overlooked is a news story that broke on
the same day as the administrative shake-up. The
Interfraternity Council has adopted a first draft of a
new proposal that would provide for changes in the
traditional “Help Week” for pledges of the 18 fra-
ternities here.

It remains to be seen whether or not the student
body will lend its support to the IFC proposals, but
the plan has merit. The time has come for action to
prevent the numerous abuses of the week of “Hell”
pledges must endure before becoming fraternity
members. Certainly there should be some sort of ac-

America-W &L Need Radical Middle

By THORN CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

Since everything that happened
in the last three weeks is mov-
ing pretty quickly into a slightly
_ foggy Spiritus
* mundi, and you
know how you
feel just as well
as I do, I think
it’s best to dis-
ms pense with
exams and Fan-
cy Dress in the
first paragraph
today, and then
move on to a
new. series’ of
impression and
lively treatments of topics of gen-
eral interest.

One such topic which struck me
as being almost completely ig-
nored is the one I've picked for
today.

In the past few months Wash-
ington and Lee has_ witnessed
something of a revival of active
political action involving nation-
al issues. I’m thinking in partie-
ular of the founding and continu-
ation of the Young Republican
Club and the Conservative Socie-
ty, and the beginning of weekly
political discussions held at the
Liquid under the auspices of the
Mongolian Minks.

In all these activities I have
begun to notice a particular void
which seems to cry for filling, not
only here at W&L, but all over
the country. We have the radical
left in some places, and the radi-
cal right seems to be everywhere.

What is missing is a pressure
group for those of us who reached
the age of discretion when nothing

Craven

exciting was happening in the
ideological battle. What I mean is
that America in general and

Washington and Lee in particular
needs the organization of a radi-
cal middle.

Made up of all othose people
who are consciously uninterested,
it ean carry on all sorts of cam-
paigns which are yet to be uncov-
ered.

In the interest of being of some
help to the future founders and
initiators of such a radical middle
group, and there are plenty of you

who could step right in on the
vanguard of this new wave, I'd
like to present some very sketchy
ideas for one such important cam-
paign which would necessarily be
among the first to be launched.

First of all an
committee could be set up to
check upon all people who are
interested in something import-
ant, with an eye toward prevent-
ing these people from increasing

Bias Into Some Courses

investigating their ranks. This could be done
very easily by making public an
account of what happens to in..o-
cent people who are caught up in
movements in either direction.

By pointing out how any move-
ment is bound inherently to cor-
rupt the movers the radical mid-
dle can bring the school, the na-
tion, and eventually the world in
from positions of antipathy which
have always been known because
of a radical middle.

In case the threat was too in-

By BRENT ARTHUR
Tuesday Writer

Students attend college for many
and varied reasons.

They come expecting an educa-
tion in any case. The Washington
and Lee campus is a good bit out of
the ordinary. Our Student Body
represents a highly selective group
of individuals. Yet how many of us
realize the difference between in-
doctrination and education?

Most of us will swear by a news-
paper article, which is but one man’s
opinion. His subject matter may have
been discussed from a biased opin-
ion, or be but one side of the story.
Herein lies the simple process of in-
doctrination.

Indoctrination is the process
wherein we are led to believe that
there is only one correct position on
a question whether the subject mat-
ter involved be in the field of sci-
ence, history, politics, religion, etc.

 

dangerous one. It is not compatible |
with the “ideal of a university,”
| I feel that this process appears quite
frequently in the W&L class room.
| However, the responsibility for
' dealing with this problem lies not
only with the professor, but with the
| student.
| Many times the “correct view-
| point” is but an opinion, which may
| or may not be shared by many oth-
| ers. What cannot be established as
| fact relies upon opinion (i.e., theory,
| ideas, beliefs, etc.) which is repre-
sented by varied points of view.
Sometimes we are subjected to
| but one perspective. Too many of us

| tend to accept this position without |

| first analyzing it. In many cases we
| do not know all that may be in-
| volved, but are willing to accept a
| theory because it was presented by a

 

but |

 

brilliant man in a particular field.
But there is always more than one
authority or scholar in a given field,
and their views are often diametri-
cally opposed to one another.

There is a vast difference between
indoctrination and education. The
true educational process consists of
presenting and exploring a subject
from all points of view. All theo-
ries and ideologies have their pros
and cons, opponents and supporters.
Education is achieved only when
one knows and understands the dif-
ferent aspects of a theory. It is up to
the student to study the merits of
each viewpoint and to draw his own
conclusions from the facts presented
him.

To teach but one side of the sub-
ject matter is not to educate, but to
indoctrinate. The educational pro-
cess is designed to make the student
think, and not just accept another’s
opinion, even though it be the pro-

This process of indoctrination is a | fessor’ s. One student had a paper

returned with “poor source” marked
beside several books in his biblio-
graphy. When checked out, these
sources represented several leading
scholars in the field who held oppos-
ing but highly respected positions.
These “poor sources” not only are
held in high esteem, but have dis-
tinguished records. This is not to
deny that there are books which
may well be poor sources but to cite
an example.

The Washington and Lee Faculty
offers its students an excellent edu-
cation. Yet, there are professors who
insist upon stressing their personal
opinion to such an extent that we
too adopt their bias without ever be-
ing exposed to other viewpoints.
This practice offers only an indoc-
trination, if we fail to explore what
some professors choose to neglect.

 

volved, what I mean is that a
radical middle can bring the world
to a complete standstill by causing
a head-on collision of left and
right. With everyone in the mid-
dle there would be no war, no
fall-out, and nobody left on base.
This idea is becoming so in-
triguing to me the more I think
about it, that I believe I might
have to do something on my own.
As I consider the radical middle
while it seems to be of such scope
that I might have to go into ac-
tion to really get it begun as an
active force on the world scene.
I'm going to have to develop this
further in the next issue.
Meanwhile all of you can be-
gin to formulate your own radical
middle plans.
We can upset the country on
both sides, fold it like a checker
board, then rule.

Undefeated WEL Mermen
To Face Tough Maryland

By AL JOHNSTON

The strength of Washington and
Lee’s undefeated mermen will be
put to one of its toughest tests
when the swimmers meet Maryland
in College Park February 12th.

 

Spring Practice
For Footballers
Starting Monday

Lincoln’s birthday will find the
varsity football aspirants starting
on their two weeks of “Spring”
practice. From Monday the 12th
continuing through Saturday the
24th the footballers will be getting
into shape, reviewing fundamentals,
and running plays preparing the
ground for the new campaign in the
Fall.

Freshmen Out

The coaches will be taking a close
look at the freshmen who are out,
trying to fit them into the blue, red
or gold teams. Coach Dana Swan
estimates that around twenty boys
from last fall’s frosh team will draw
equipment and try out.

Coach Swan feels Skip Chase,
Ash Allen, Chuck Long, Dan Ma-
son, Greg Sharkey, Bill Julian and
Al Hubbard will be some of the
promising frosh who could break
into the ranks of the varsity.

Coach Buck Leslie has _ been
working with the freshmen and
sophomore gridders three afternoons
a week on a voluntary basis. They
have been running, swimming, and
playing basketball since football
season to stay in shape.

 

Globetrotters At VMI;
Team Here March 16

For those who like basketball and
a little clowning March 16th is a
date to remember. The world fa-
mous Harlem Globetrotters will ap-
at the VMI field house that evening.

Meadowlark Lemon with his zany

antics, and the whole team will come
to Lexington.

During the past season the Mary-
land Terps have displayed their
ability by beating such teams as
Pittsburgh and North Carolina.

Two brothers, Hugh and Ted Lu-
pien, will cause the Generals some
troubles. Hugh swims the butterfly
and Ted competes in the breast
stroke and freestyle events. These
two have helped Maryland achieve
such a fine record this season.

The Terps are characterized by a
lot of depth, having more than one
good man in each event to get
them those extra points.

In addition to the Lupien brothers
Maryland has Schaeberle in the
breastroke who in last year’s meet
came close to upsetting W&L’s rec-
ord-breaking Captain, Elliot May-
nard.

Coach Norris Eastman stated that
his boys will have a little over a
week to practice and that they will
be in the best shape possible by
Monday.

 

 

Frosh Sports

This week in sports at Washington
and Lee will see the freshman

This Saturday the JV Wrest-
ling team takes on the Duke frosh

ful freshman basketball squad plays

| McHenry To Stress Defense With Tigers

 

Washington and Lee’s basketball
' team launches a stretch drive for its
| first .500 season in six years Satur-
|day night against Hampden-Syd-
ney’s Tigers.

| “But we have to win our next
| two home games (Hampden-
| Sydney and Roanoke next Wed-
nesday)” Coach Bob McHenry
| cautions.
| Hampden-Sydney, the number two
‘tecm in Virginia’s Little Eight, of-
fers a formidable stumbling block
in the Generals’ path towards their
.500 goal. The Tigers decisioned
, W&L, 77-66, at Hampden-Sydney
despite the fact the the Generals
played one of their best games of
of the year, according to McHenry.
The main reason that Washington
and Lee lost was a 6-2 forward
named Bill Hardin. Hardin, the
state’s leading scorer, poured in
32 points as he paced the Tiger at-
tack.

We'll have to stop Hardin Sat-
urday, McHenry emphasized. “By
stopping I mean holding him to

 

less than 20 points,” he added.

McHenry already has several |
good-working defenses, but he is |

Face Duke In Saturday Meet

The W&L wrestlers put their 4-2,
record on the line against Duke |
University there this Saturday. |

|

Coach Dick Miller is presented |

with some difficulties in the 120 |
Ib. division, because Co-Captain

Dave Montgomery is a doubtful |

starter, temporarily sidelined with |

a foot injury. |

Back-up man, Bo Jones, sustained |
an ankle injury and won't be able}
to wrestle, Miller said. |

“Ready To Go”

The rest of the squad is ready to,
go Saturday, Miller added, and is
looking for win number five.

Butch West will hold down the

123 lb. division, while another
freshman, Tom Stoner, will wres-
tle at 137 Ibs. Miller will go with
Chuck Owens at 147 Ibs.

Co-Captain Sandy Mersereau fills
the 157 lb. spot with solid perfor-
mer Dick Albert at 169. Herb Smith
at 177 lbs., and Jud Babcock at un-
limited fill out the General starting
lineup.

Four Matches Left

After Duke, Hampden-Sydney,
West Virginia, and the University
of Virginia remain on the wrestling
winter slate.

W&L will entertain the Moun-
taineers Feb. 16 in Doremus Gym for
the last home contest of the season.

Generals Prepare For H-S

| adding a special one for the Hamp-, of defense we played against Nor-

| folk William and Mary in our last
' game,” the coach said.

| “Norfolk came into the game with
a 7-2 record and we put the pressure
| on them. Consequently they hit only
| 15 per cent from the floor the first
half. They weren’t off either. Our
defense stopped them. In the second
half they hit 40 per cent but that
was because our boys got tired.”

W&L, which built up a 32-18
halftime lead, defeated the Mon-
archs, 71-58.

Defense has been the key to
W&L’s limited success so far this
season; and surprisingly enough
the key to the W&L defense has
been freshman guard Louis Pa-
atrno.

 

Paterno along with captain Rodger
Fauber and guard Tom Supak carry
the brunt of the W&L offensive at-
tack. All three are averaging over
1l points per game.

But, as McHenry says, “if our de-
fense can stop the opponents, our
offense will be all right, and our de-
fense is looking stronger every
game.”

system as it exists now, gives entirely too much lee-

and frustrations by excessively cruel action against

college freshmen.

Shifting the emphasis back to sports again, the

Scene occured last week with announcement that
the university would join Sewanee, Southwest-
ern of Tennessee, and Centre College of Ken-
tucky in a new college athletic conference. Edi-
torial comment in newspapers all

Some grumbling on the campus has been heard,
