Little Interest Is Shown
In Control Committee

By STEVE SMITH
As of Thursday, only three students at Washington and Lee had applied
to serve as members of the Student Control Committee. By Friday, two
more applications had been received by EC Secretary Steve Suttle.
Suttle said that the deadline for application for a committee position will

come next week.

There is no excuse for a lack of interest or support among students
for the new committee. Failure of the student body to support the Control
Committee to the fullest would be certain to illustrate only that it is
unworthy of the trust which has been given it by the administration.

Last year the student body voted for a platform which included
as a goal the formation of just such a body. Now the faculty has
conceded the responsibility of discipline to student government, and
the students must show that they are able to accept the responsibil-

ity they have won.

In creating the Student Control Committee the faculty actually gave
more power to the student body than had been requested by the Execuive
Committee. There is no faculty member on the committee as was originally
planned by the EC. Now it is turn about.

Steve Suttle said that he expects more applications for the committee
mmbership at the last minute, “after the EC members go around to speak

to fraternities, and the people realize what has happened.” When some-!

thing of this nature occurs students must not wait to be pushed; they
must exhibit interest in the committe if it is to be a success.
As Uncas McThenia said, the committee will at times not be composed

of “the most popular guys in the world,” because its members will have |
an enforcement job. But if the responsibility is not immediately and cap-'!

ably taken up by students—responsibility is likely to escape them.

McThenia has further described the background of the committee.
He said that the plan is the result of several weeks of planning by the
faculty and Administration Committee and the EC.

Although the faculty group is of course “not an impersonal group,
yet the students will be closer” by treating discipline problems them-
selves, he said. “When we came to Washington and Lee we accepted
the Honor System. If we can mature in one area, it’s only a step

to spread into other areas.”

Another advantage of student control was seen in greater pride in the
general conduct of the student body. McThenia pointed out that respon-
sibility for conduct will bring this effect. The Student Control Committee
is not so much a punitive committee “as it is to prevent,” reminded the

President.

No set of penalties have been outlined which the committee may take,
for the reason that the group will always act with regard to circumstances.
The faculty Administrative Committee has acted in the past on the same

idea.

The EC could not have handled this job, said McThenia, without dis-
cipline becoming confused in some student’s minds with the Honor System.
To remove any confusion with Honor System and the EC or with other
affairs, an entirely new body has been created. Honor offenses will continue
to be handled by the EC, of course, as will police court convictions by the

faculty.

 

Literary Society Hears Flournoy
Discuss Stratford-on-Avon Tour

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Wednesday night Dr. Fitzgerald
Flournoy spoke to members and
guests of the Washington Literary
Society. He gave a humorous and
informative reading of a paper, orig-
inally prepared for the Advisory
Committee of the Faculty, in which
he discussed his experiences in Eu-
rope this past summer.

His elaboration on the text includ-
ed expositions of “those things that
should not be included in a formal
report.”

On June 5 Dr. Flournoy set sail
on the “Great Bear” (he has been
kidded about this) for France. His
account of the voyage drew peals of
laughter and a few guffaws from the
audience.

Floating Roommate

One of his roommates was a ballet
dance (male) whose ease in “float-
ing down from his upper deck bed”
astounded Dr. Flournoy, who ad-
mitted that he certainly did not
float from his own bed.

Paris was having a Ballet Festival,
part of which was described with
infinite delicacy by Dr. Flournoy. He
commented on the French predilic-
tion for ironic jesting and told of

 

Episcopal Church Plans
Christmas Service Dec. 14

The annual Christmas Candlelight
Service will take place in the Robert
E. Lee Episcopal Church at ten
o'clock on the evening of Thurs-
day, December 14. Ken Lane is
chairman of the UCA committee re-
sponsible for planning the service
and decorating the church.

Lane says that the usual format
for the service will be followed. Stu-
dents will read passages from the
Bible designed to tell the Christmas
story.

The scripture readings will be in-
terspersed with the singing of
hymns.

Lane hopes to get Dr. John N.
Thomas, a member of the Board of
Trustees, to deliver the Christmas
Meditation. The Washington and Lee
Glee Club will be asked to partici-
pate.

The service is non-denominational;
all students and faculty members are
invited to attend.

 

the time he astounded and won the
friendship of the young lady who
cared for his rooms.

He visited the Flea Market and
the church of the Sacred Heart for
the first time and tangentially des-
cribed the past history of both.

Rabelaisian Dinner

Dr. Flournoy visited the home
of Rabelais and there ate a “mag-
nificent meal in memory of him.” He
later described some of the wonders
of French culinary art.

One dinner with friends lasted
from 8:00 until 11:00. The first course
consisted of Pea Soup, the second of
steak, the third of a souffle with a
brandy sauce flavored with orange.

The main purpose of his European
visit was to attend a_ six-weeks
course in Shakespeare and Eliza-
bethan Drama in Shakespeare’s home
town of Stratford-on-Avon.

The students, mostly professors
and graduate school students, at-
tended seminars, wrote papers, and
attended plays and lectures.

Dr. Flournoy said that the stu-
dents were welcomed by the towns-
people and described Stratford as
an agricutural and market town, ex-
cept for the tourist trade and the
brewing industry. He passed around
postcards illustrating the wild
swans at Stratford, the home and
grave of Shakespeare, and several
French castles he visited.

Stratford Tour

The students were given a tour of
Stratford and environs, including
the park where, in the words of the
townspeople, “Willie pinched the
deer.” They visited Bath, an early
Roman swimming pool, and Stone-
henge.

In the course of his travels, Dr.
Flournoy ran into several Washing-
ton and Lee alumni and faculty
members and revisited Oxford, “that
home of lost causes,” where he visit-
ed some friends he had not seen
“since we were boys at Oxford.”

After his talk coffee and tea were
served to those who wished to stay
and it was announced that there
would be an organizational meeting
of the Washington Literary Society
this coming Tuesday at 7:30 in the
Student Union. Students interested
in membership should come to this
meeting.

 

 

Dr. Boulding talks to students after his speech.

Boulding Discusses
Ethics Of Economics

By STEVE SMITH

and PHIL OLIVER

“We have to discover that all men are brothers—we may
discover that we are no longer a great power,” economist Ken-
neth Boulding warned a W&L audience Tuesday night.

Boulding was speaking in the first of a two-part lecture on
the meaning of economic development in the world and some

 

True Slate
Staged Reading

The Troubadours are now
in rehearsal preparing George
Bernard Shaw’s Don Juan in
Hell for opening November
30. The play, which is essen-
tially Act III of Shaw’s Man

and Superman, will run three nights,
Thursday through Saturday, No-
vember 30-December 2, starting at
8:30 p.m.

There are only four actors in the
play. Mrs. Ruth R. Browne, PiKA
housemother, will read the part of
Dona Ana. The three male actors are
all members of the W&L faculty. Dr.
Cecil D. Jones, director of the
Troubadour Theatre, will act as Don
Juan. Dr. James K. Shillington, asse-
ciate professor of chemistry, will be
the statute, and journalism instruc-
tor John K. Jennings will do the part
of the devil.

Don Juan in Hell will be presented
in the form of a staged reading.
That is, there will be no costumes,
illusional scenery or _ character
make-up, and the actors will remain
seated. However, gestures will be
used and the reading will be like a
play in all other aspects. Since the
production is an extra addition to

_ the Troub schedule, season ticket

holders as well as the general public
are advised that admission will be
$1.00. Seat reservations can be made
by telephoning the Troubadour
Theatre after the Thanksgiving
vacation starting November 27.

Ashley Wiltshire
Is Baptist Head

Washington and Lee senior Ashley
Wiltshire was recently elected presi-
dent of the Virginia Baptist Student
Union, at the state BSU convention.

Wiltshire, a Delt pre-ministerial
student, was not present at the
convention and did not even know
of his nomination. He was out of
the state with the football team dur-
ing the weekend of the Baptist youth
meeting at Eagle Eyrie, Va. “All I
know is, I was standing in front of
the Delt house and somebody drove
by and told me I was president,” he
says.

Actually the election was not such
a surprise. In his sophomore year
Wiltshire served as vice president of
the state organization, and he spent
an entire summer working with
churches in Jamacia under Baptist
Student Union sponsorship.

Several W&L students attended
the state convention, which was
crowded with about 350 students and
coeds from Virginia colleges. In the
election, a VMI cadet was elected
vice president of the group, which
represents some 8,000 students in
this state.

To Sing In Lee Chapel Tonight

Tonight at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel, |
the Washington and Lee Concert |
Guild will present Oscar MeCul-
lough, baritone. Mr. McCollough’s |
program will include the following: |
Dichterliebe-Shumann, Benjamin
Britten’s arrangements of four Brit-
ish Folk Songs, five art songs of
Brahms and four songs of Charles |
Ives.

Mr. McCullough graduated from
Baldwin Wallace College with a
Bachelor of Music Degree. Then he |
went to the Eastman School of Mu- |
sic of the University of Rochester,
from which he graduated in 1952
with a Master of Music Degree and |
a Performer’s Certificate.

Mr. McCullough has _ directed |
many Choir and Choral groups, and |
Opera Workshop at the college level |
in recent years. During this time he

number of engagements as a soloist.
He has spent his summers studying
with many of today’s outstanding
musicians: Boris Goldovsky and Paul
Ulanovsky at Tanglewood, Weldon
Kilburn and Aksel Schiotz at the
Royal Conservatory of Music of
Toronto, Leonard Treash at Oglebay
Opera Institute, Paul Schilhawsky,
Dr. Robert Wagner and Alexander
Paulmuller at the International
Summer Academy at the Mozarteum
in Salzburg. Presently he is teach-
ing at Hollins College.

Mr. McCullough has performed 18
operas and 15 oratorios with var-
ious orchestras in Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina, New York
and Ohio as well as Canada, Austria,
and Germany.

This concert is the second in a
series of six presented by the Guild

 

' has experienced an ever increasing! for the 1961-62 season.

kof the ethical problems implied in

in it. The next evening he again
spoke in Lee Chapel.

Boulding suggested that Christian-
ity is probably the only bridge over
the gaps between peoples today.
Fighting, he said, is no longer
reasonable.

He explored the problems inherent
in both capitalistic and socialistic
ways of life. The most important
ethical problem of an affluent so-
ciety such as ours, he said, is
how to learn: how to be able to
start. “The poor know how to start,
but people of an affluent society
have had little experience of spiri-
tual benefit.”

There is a great deal of mock
heroics in the United States, Bould-
ing said, and not enough real hero-
ism. He stated that a market-orien-
tated society is vulgar, and that
there is nothing heroic about capital-
ism’s shopkeepers. But he noticed a
real heroism in the racial movement
of the Negro race. He described the
integration effort as a type of hero-
ism of a Christian origin.

A great problem to our civiliza-
tion, according to Boulding is the
difficulty of the rich to be moral at
all. Since the United States is the
richest nation in the world, it would
not seem strange that we also have
such a striking crime rate and are
faced with a slow decay at the
heart of our principles.

Perhaps the greatest shocker of
Boulding’s statements was that “the
proletariat is almost disappearing.”
“For all practical purposes the pro-
letariat will disappear in the U‘S. in
25 years,” and it is already disap-
pearing in Soviet Russia, he said.

Boulding suggested that the reason
for the inferiority of socialism to
capitalism is that the government
is responsible for the people “The
arrogance that I can be responsible
for you,” he explained, “does not
inspire you to do good or to be re-
sponsible.”

Another problem of the USSR is
that its socialism is not pure, said
Boulding. He cited dictatorship as
a poor stimulus to a people’s quali-
ties.

Boulding made it clear, however,
that socialism is a powerful economic
threat to America and to capitalism.

“Man is faced with the most awful
choice in history,” said the econo-
mist. “He can’t stay where he is. He
must go on into a world of stable
peace or fall backwards...”

Boulding is a well-known econo-
mist who is presently serving as pro-
fessor of economics at the University
of Michigan.

Pledges Hear
Sigma Nu

Richard Fletcher, chief executive
of Sigma Nu fraternity, told Wash-
ington and Lee fraternity pledges
last night that “A pledge has a right
to be treated as a man seeking an
education.”

Fletcher hit hazing as “a practice
we associate with kids.” He warned
that the housekeeping, goals, and
“production of educational dimen-
sion” were somewhat lacking in
Washington and Lee fraternities.
Fletcher is close to fraternity life
in Lexington at the Sigma Nu na-
tional headquarters.

He painted a picture which he
hoped the pledges will be able to see
in their own chapters after they are
initiated. Fraternities, he said, have
“the greatest potential in the world.”
But he voiced the opinion that fra-
ternities have yet to fulfill the po-
tential greatly. He outlined the fra-
ternal mission as combining “family,
church, and education in brother-
hood, ritual, and study.

Fraternity men, said Fletcher, are
still an “over-privileged” group—
the elite, although this is not ap-
parently the case in Lexington. An
extremely small percentage of col-
lege men are members of fraterni-
ties.

Fletcher is a former director of
athletics at the University of Vir-
ginia and journalism teacher,

A Protest Of Our Own

The editors of Protest made some very good suggestions
last week. We have been well-pleased this year with their sense
of responsibility and have noticed the improvement in that
publication’s prose. It’s a far cry from the “hate” columns we
were subjected to last year.

However, we think it should be emphasized that the op-
portunities exist for OLB, Dutchie, and the rest to take part
in the student government here if they will only come down
off their respective hobby horses and offer to do a little work.
Anyone can write Letters to the Editor.

 

Have any of these people who want constitutional reforms
submitted their proposals to Steve Suttle for the Executive
Committee study? Or, if they dislike going through the EC,
have they sought by circulating a petition to have these pro-
posals brought before the student body for a vote? They have
not.

Have any of them offered to serve on the Assimilation
Committee, with whose work they are dissatisfied? We wager
they have not.

Have any of them offered their expert services in mass
communications to the Ring-tum-Phi? We haven’t seen them.

How many of them have applied to serve on the Dance
Board Advisory Council? How many of them will apply to
serve on the new Student Disciplinary Committee?

How many of them have contributed sound and construc-
tive thought on the Honor System to the pages of Protest,
or the Ring-tum Phi; or to discussions in the EC and elsewhere?

How many of them have ever done anything on this cam-
pus but gripe?

We're disgusted with this guerilla action that Protest is
directing against a group of men who have given a great deal
of their time and their thought to student government at Wash-
ington and Lee.

There are many ways in which student affairs here can be
improved. Every organization on campus needs improvement
in one way or another.

We challenge these malcontents to stop screaming at the
people who are doing the work on campus and we’d be de-
lighted to show them how they can help share the load of work
which overwhelms every student leader at present. It’s time for
Protest to put up or shut up.

A Sense Of Pride

Tomorrow will mark the last appearance on Wilson Field
for a group of men who have given a great deal to Washington
and Lee. They, of course, are the seniors on this year’s football
team. They have lifted W&L football from a time when we had
to apologize for it to the present, when every member of the
W&L community can walk tall on fall Saturdays.

Football, like any sport, demands sacrifices. Time spent on
the practice field could have been spent studying, or dating, or
sleeping, or getting to be a Big Man on Campus. Training rules
separate a man from much of the social life here three months
of the year. The W&L football team makes plenty of sacri-
fices. Every member of the team would tell you, if asked, that
he played football just because he enjoyed it. That, as anyone
who has ever known the rough physical contact on the grid-
iron knows, is reason enough for the sacrifices.

Something more than ‘‘fun”’ however, has driven the team
to their present heights. A fierce pride in Washington and Lee
has done the job. The men on the team have not forgotten
the ridicule heaped on us when we were down. For four years
the senior footballers have been determined to erase the shame
of those autumns from 1955 through 1958. They were deter-
mined to prove to all the world that there were still men at
W&L. They have.

Courtney Mauzy and Bob Funkhouser of last year’s team
and every senior on the team this year deserve a special vote
of thanks from Washington and Lee, even if they would be
a little embarrassed to receive it.

Let’s Cross-Pollinate!

Dr. Kenneth Boulding’s appearance here this week, spon-
sored jointly by the departments of religion and economics,
is part of an encouraging trend at Washington and Lee toward
closer cooperation between the various departments of study.

We are firm believers in the principle of a departmental
major, on the grounds that a man is not really educated unless
he has become thoroughly acquainted with one discipline. But
we do feel that academic work here tends to adhere too closely
to departmental limits. This leads to an unfortunate overcom-
partmentalization. Or, to put it simply, this week’s sessions
affirmed that you can’t study economics without taking an in-
terst in religion, and vice versa. The thorough study of a single
discipline tends always to lead one into other disciplines.

We'd like to see more of this interdepartmental coopera-
tion in the day-to-day work here. If religion has something to
contribute to economics, why shouldn’t our own Professors
Hodges and Sprunt present “guest lectures” in the commerce
school? The department of psychology can contribute a great
deal to the study of literature. The natural sciences are woe-
fully disregarded by liberal arts majors.

Here’s for more cross-pollination.

 

An Interview With Dr. Hughes

 

The German Reunification Problem

By TRACY HARRINGTON

As Berlin continues to balance
precariously in its half-communist,
half-free political schizophrenia, the
possibilities for any chance of Ger-
man unification lessen. The Western
and Communist worlds seem to stand
on clearly defined policies—neither
showing any sign of “giving in” in
order to fuse the two Germanys.
Russia won’t permit free elections
in East Germany, and the U.S. re-
fuses to abandon its military po-
sition in West Germany.

Communist propaganda overflows
with warnings of the “re-creation of

German militarism,” and all-to-vivid| |

photographs of World War II atroci-
ties are sprinkled liberally through
articles decrying armament in West
Germany.

According to Dr. Thomas P.
Hughes, associate professor of his-
tory, the obvious effort of the com-
munists to create an image of Ger-
many as she was under the Nazi
regime may really be sincere.

“I think that the Russians are
genuinely afraid of the Germans. We
must remember that the Russians
have been invaded twice in this
century by the Germans,” he said.

He pointed out that although the
Germans have behaved arrogantly
since 1933, for 100 years before that
they were “some of the most creative
and disciplined people of Europe.”

He said it is not fair for us “to
balance 15 years against 100.”

Bowl Coach

(Editor’s note—The Ring-tum Phi
happened recently upon this ex-
change of letters between Quiz Bowl
Coach Frank Parsons and alumnus
Phil Grose. Parsons’ answer appears
on page four.)

Coach Frank Parsons
Washington and Lee University
Lexington, Va .

Dear Coach Parsons,

As an irate alumnus who just
viewed our dear alma mater’s na-
tional disgrace, I feel compelled to
write and suggest that either you
be fired from your job as college
bowl coach, or that we step up our
scholarship program so that we can
compete with our natural rivals
such as Pomona on an even basis. In
short, I think that amateur studies
are not producing the type of col-
lege bowl teams which we as alumni
think are representative of the
school. I believe what we need, coach
Parsons, is a system of scouts
throughout the country who could
report to the University on out-
standing scholastic prospects for the
team. Then we could go through a
period of recruiting these special
students, luring them with such
things as new cars and jobs for their
families and friends. It might also
be advisible to hold out certain out-
standing college bowl prospects for
a year, sort of “red-booking” them
so they can learn and study and not
lose a year of eligibility.

Coach Parsons, I know that there
are those who will be wrong-think-
ers and say such things as “Studies
for Students, Not Students for
Studies,” and claim that students
can have fun and learn at the same
time, but we as alumni, do not think
such a plan is feasible if we are to
keep up with our natural rivals.
Now I know this high school senior
down here with a great pair of eyes,
reads fast, has a great IQ, can move
quickly from book to book without
losing his balance, and has some
tremendous moves with a_ pencil.
Also he’ll show up real well before
the cameras. (Coach Parsons, some
of those fellows we had on TV to-
day...)

Well, coach, you know you can
count on me to support the old Uni-
versity come what may. I’m loyal,
but many more losses like today’s
and I'll switch my allegiance to a
more powerful school like Haver-
ford or Oberlin.

of the diesel engine; Helmholtz, one
of the greatest scientists of the 19th
century; and Thomas Mann, whose
fame as a writer is universal. This
is to mention only a few—there were
the industrialists, the musicians, and

Dr. Hughes

others who contributed much to the
world’s culture.

“It is an accepted fact that German
universities of the 19th century were
the best in the world. Students had
more freedom of movement because
discipline was not necessary—the
motivation to work was already in
them.

“Certainly we must think of the
concentration camps of World War

 

 

| Il. But can we forget the German

universities of the past century?”

Dr. Hughes believes that Germany
will—and must—be reunited. “It will
come,” he said, “either as a result
of war or negotiations, but it will
come.”

Does he believe that we need fear
“German militarism?”

“Possibly, the humiliation which

‘| the Germans have suffered in two
|| defeats in the century would make

them again want to be military.
Perhaps they are not ready for uni-

| fication, but we must help them find

themselves.”
According to Dr. Hughes, the hu-
miliation of the Germans following

_| World War I and in the subsequent

depression probably made them
susceptible to Hitler’s frenzied ide-
ology. “They had been a great peo-
ple, and they wanted to be again.
Hitler simply offered them a means.”

Here in the United States, we
seem to be concerned over whether
the German question of re-unifica-
tion will bring about a global war.
Dr. Hughes said that we would not
go to war to unify Germany, “but
the tense German situation could re-
sult in a set of circumstances that
would bring about war.

“What we have in Germany now
is simply a manifestation of the basic
distrust between the United States
and the U.S.S.R.”

What about the rest of the free
world, especially those European
countries which suffered from Ger-
man agression in World War II? How
do they feel about unification?

 

“Both Britain and France are pub-
licly on the record for reunification.
In England, German troops trained
in German uniforms with little hos-
tile demonstration. I think Europeans
are really for unification.

“Immediately after the war they
probably would not have felt as they
do now, but there is little ill feeling
remaining between the Germans and
other Europeans,” he said.

Again and again Dr. Hughes em-
phasized that it is neither to our in-
terest nor to the interest of the
Russians to keep Germany divided.
“It is an unnatural thing for the
Germans to be so divided, and West
Germany may take advantage of
enmity between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. to pursue its own end, if
we allow this unnatural situation to
prevail.”

If Germany, then, must reunify,
the question is how?

“Ultimately, we must decide to
deal with West Germany as an in-
dependent nation. We must realize
that we can no longer decide Ger-
man policy.

“Also, Russia must make conces-
sions. Both sides must quit using
Germany, and give her an opportu-
nity to contribute as a_ unified
whole.”

Russia is not going to allow free
elections, and we are not going to
withdraw our troops. If concessions
are in order, they don’t seem to be
possible presently. But, as Dr.
Hughes has said, “Germany will be
united—either as a result of nego-
tiations or war.”

Thanksgiving In New York, Mildew Style

By STEVE HENRY
November 30
Dear Bobby,

I sure wish I could have made it
home for Thanksgiving this year,
but it is a long way from good
old Washington and Lee to Arkan-
sas. I missed seeing you and all
the folks down there, but I guess
I'll survive until Christmas.

Anyway, I just wanted to write
and tell you about New York, where
we all went during the Thanks-
giving holidays. All the cool guys
here go up to New York every
year—it’s the only really cool thing
to do. Don’t get me wrong. I’d rath-
er be able to go home, but you
know how it is.

New York is something else, let
me tell you. It’s just like in the
movies, just exactly like in the
movies, except during Thanksgiv-
ing there are about a million kids
up there, from all the cool schools
like us and Harvard and all those,
you know. I wish you could get a
chance to go up during the holidays.
Tll guarantee you, you would never
forget it.

But, anyway, I went up with a
bunch of guys on the train. We
got on the train in Washington, and,
no kidding, it was like a refugee
train in one of those movies about
India, you know what I mean. There
were people standing up on the
seats and in the aisles and every-
where, and when I got a seat finally,
I wasn’t about to give it up to any
old lady or anybody, let me tell
you.

You might think it’s crazy for us
to go up on the train when it’s all
that crowded, but we had a reason,
believe me. All kinds of girls go up
on the trains—girls from all over
everywhere, and it’s really easy to
find a good girl to date up there in
the city while you’re on the train.

For instance, 1 met this really
cute girl on the train from Hollins
(that’s a girl’s school, by the way),
and we sat together on the way up.
We really got along great, and talk-
ed about all kinds of things, and I
said to myself, “Mildew, old boy,
you have really scored this time.
This is a good baby and she’s hot
for you.” But the funniest thing
happened when we got to this little
town outside New York. I think it
was something like Princeton, New
Jersey (or is it Princeton, New
York?), Anyway, this guy got on the
train, and he had on khaki pants
and a dirty raincoat and the girl
practically crawled all over me get-
ting to the aisle so she could crawl
all over him, right in front of every-
body in the whole car, too. I finally

figured out that they had been go-
ing together and had planned to
meet there, because I know good and
well that she would never dump on
a Washington and Lee man for some
cruddy guy with khakis and a dirty
raincoat. Me with my Thomas, Ltd.
(that’s a clothing store at school)
yellow shirt on and all.

Man, I knew I wasn’t a problem.
I just wish I could have had a few
more minutes with her, and I don’t
even think she would have gone
back to that guy ever. I think I’ll
call her up sometime, but that’s
something else.

Anyway, to make a long story
short, after that happened, I didn’t
meet any other girls on the train,
so we just stood up between cars
and drank, and by the time we got
to the city we were really in the
bag (drunk, you know), and barely
could make it to the hotel where
we were staying, which was the Bilt-
more and is a big college kid hang-
out.

You wouldn’t believe it, there were
so many kids standing around. Girls
and boys, laughing and yelling and
some even singing. We just had
walked in the door, and guess who
I saw. Billy Osborne, of all people.
Can you imagine running into an-
other guy from home in New York?
Well, I talked with Billy and he said
he really liked things at Dartmouth,
and that I ought to come up the next
day for a drink.

The next day I got up pretty early
and decided to go sight-seeing like
mother wrote that she wanted me to
do, but first I decided to go up to
Billy’s room in the Roosevelt (an-
other hotel) and see what was going
on. We went over to the Roosevelt,
and there were a million kids stand
ing around, and I even got a date
right out of the lobby. (She was from
Hartford, Connecticut, and went to
Smith, by the way. Don’t ask me
where Smith is. I don’t know. It’s
a girls school or something I think.)

Anyway, we went up to Billy’s
and there were all kinds of people
up there drinking. We started get-
ting a party going, and before we
knew it, it was noon and time for
Thanksgiving dinner, and we went
down to a Howard Johnson’s and
ate a hamburger, and then came
back up to the apartment and stay-
ed until dark when it was time to
go out in the city.

We were walking out of the hotel,
and my date says to me, “Mildew, I
know it’s so expensive up here,
and daddy gave me some money and
I want to go Dutch, if it’s all right
with you.” Now you know darn
well it was fine with me, and we

went to this place called the African
Room which was really neat, but
quite expensive. In fact, I got a
check for twenty-three dollars, and
I sat there waiting for this girl to
come up with eleven-fifty, but she
just sat there, too, and I ended up
paying the whole thing, which more
or less hacked me off. I ended up
spending nearly fifty bucks that
night, if you can believe it. You

News Item

CHICAGO (UPI)—The coroner
asked permission recently to hire
a second attendant for the midnight-
to-8 a.m. shift at the county morgue
because the present attendant “is
afraid to stay alone in the morgue
with the bodies.”

Corner Andrew J. Towman told
the Cook County board that the lone
attendant now sometimes puts the
receiving office telephone outside the
window and stays out in the cold
awaiting any calls.

“You mean you want someone to
hold his hands so he won't get
scared?” asked C. R. Hodgeman,
the budget director.

“That's partly it,’ Mr. Toman re-
plied. “He must help put bodies
away, too.”

The corner said that none of the
three daytime attendants wanted the
job.

“They are just as scared,”
said.

PiK A’s And Chi’s
Get I-M Victories

By HOWIE KORMAN

With first place decided in all
four football divisions, the playoffs
between the champions began on
November 14. In the opening round
of the double elimination tourna-
ment, Sigma Chi out scored Phi
Kap 7-0 to keep its record unblem-
ished. In the second game the grid-
ders from PiKA rallied in the second
half to defeat the Betas, 6-0.

The I-M Bowling program at
the Lexington Alleys, Sigma Nu,
PiKA and the Delts opened their
seasons with wins on November 14.

After losing the first game, the
rollers from Sigma Nu combined
for a 2151 total to down Phi Ep.
High man for the winners was
Thorns Craven, while Bob Wiess-
man of the PEP’s had games of
178, 131, and 201.

In the PiKA-DU encounter, the
winners showed strength in this
sport by having all their players
bowl at least 400 for three games.
PiKA Dick Spencer had the high
game of the evening with a 211
finish.

Later in the same day the Delts
overpowered Pi Phi.

Baby Generals
End Season

Against SMA

After six straight losses most foot-
ball teams would be glad to forget
the whole thing. But not Washington
and Lee’s freshman football team.

The Baby Generials, who have
fought six losing battles, are still
as eager to play football as the
varsity W&L squad that is rolling
along with a lengthy victory string.

One of the best examples of the
Baby Generals’ desire to play came
in their 50-0 loss to Chowan Jr.
College several weeks ago. Late in
the game W&L got the ball at mid-
field, but wasn’t content to just
run out the clock. The Baby Gener-
als took two straight time outs
in order to get in two more plays.

Staunton

The Baby Generals’ desire will get
another test this afternoon in their
third straight game against the
cream of the Virginia Military
League. This week’s opponent is
Staunton Military Academy, the
league’s number one club and one
of the best prep teams in Virginia.

The game scheduled for 3:15 on
W&L’s Wilson Field, will be a benefit
for the Lexington High School band.
Even the home team will pay to
get into the stadium.

In analyzing Staunton, freshman
coach Dana Swan points out that
offensively it concentrates on po-
tent end sweeps and the belly series,
and defensively it uses a 5-4 or
Oklahoma type formation.

Generals Meet Frederick College
Tomorrow In Last Home Game

Washington and Lee’s undefeated football Generals make
their last 1961 home stand tomorrow at 2 p.m. when they meet
Frederick College on Wilson Field.

The Generals are the Lions’ only state opponent, and
head coach Lee MClaughlin points out that a Frederick victory
would permit the Lions to claim state small college supremacy.

Frederick enters tomorrow’s con-* =

test with an even 3-3 season’s
record. W&L is 7-0 for the year.

“There’s no doubt about it, they'll
come up here with blood in their
eyes,” says McLaughlin. “Frederick
has beaten some pretty good foot-
ball teams, lost by close margins
to some other good ones, and we
know we'll have a tougher game
than some people expect on the
basis of comparative records.”

Similar to E-H

Freshman Coach Dana Swan, who
has scouted Frederick, says the
Lions are very similar to Emory
and Henry in the style of football
they offer.

“They've got all the equipment
needed to play good football,” re-
ported Swan. “They have size and
speed and desire. They'll be tough.”

Swan was particularly impressed
by halfback Bobby Gray. “As fast
as greased lightning,” said Swan,
noting that the Generals may see
unusually heavy assaults on their
flanks this Saturday.

In an effort to match the Gener-|

als’ three-unit depth, Swan said
Frederick Coach Bill McDonald used
an effective second unit as such in

the Lions’ 8-7 loss to Maryville Sat-|

urday.

 

| ton scoreless last year, winning 28-0.

 

Swan says a single defensive mis-
take cost the Lions the game against
Maryville. Other Lion defeats were
Newport News Apprentice School
and very tough Newberry, by a
respectable 23-0 score. On the credit
side, Frederick has bumped West
Virginia Tech, Grove City and Edin-
boro State Teachers, the latter two
rugged small Pennsylvania colleges.

Injuries

McLaughlin is concerned about
the physical pounding the Generals
have absorbed of late, starting with
the Emory and Henry game. The
personnel situation is most acute at
right guard and left tackle where
two of the first three men at each
spot are sidelined.

“Some of our injuries are not
the really crippling kind, but they’re
the kind that reduce our effective-
ness,” McLaughlin points out. He
says that senior guard Tommy
Goodwin’s response to treatment of
a leg injury has him worried.
Goodwin, says McLaughlin, is “our
‘class’ lineman.”

The Generals wind up the 1961
season with a Thanksgiving Day
game at Washington University in
St. Louis, Mo. W&L held Washing-

 

 

Frederick Is
New Opponent

Frederick College, W&L’s oppon-
ent tomorrow, is a four-year college
for the first time this year.

Located in Portsmouth, Virginia,
Frederick switched over to the
four-year plan this term after a
long history as a junior college.

Like Washington and Lee, Fred-
erick does not go out of its way to
field a football power, but still man-
ages to field a better than average
small college team.

This year’s Lion editon has posted
a 3-3 record against small college
competition.

* * *

A victory Saturday will hike Lee
McLaughlin’s college coaching rec-
ord above the .500 mark. He’s now
19-19-2 after nearly five years.

ae * *

The Generals now have scored
234 points, an average of 33.4 a
game, while allowing their oppon-
ents only 26 points. The points-per-
game average is good enough to
rank Washington and Lee in the top
ten NCAA small colleges, offensively,
while the stinginess of the defense is
believed to be second nationally
among both NCAA and NIAA small-
college teams.

I made up my mind when I woke
up at noon the next day that I was
going to do something worthwhile
(I was feeling pretty bad about the
night before), so I went downstairs,

a cocktail party at another hotel,

worth it at all. Don’t tell anybody
at home about this, you hear.

Saturday was about the same
way, except we threw a party in
our room, which was really the
only way we could pay back all the
guys we had bummed off the other
two days. I hate to admit it, but I
passed out sometime in the after-
noon, and didn’t wake up _ until
almost ten that night. I had made
a date already, but when I went
to get her it was too late, and she
was gone. I tried to get another
date, but no dice. I went back to
the hotel and watched television.
New York has _ seven television
channels, and it was great.

Like I told you, New York is the

mas, but I’ve got to go now. See
you in December.

Coach Parsons’ Answer

Dear Alumnus Grose:

It is apparent there is no middle
ground which will serve the best
interest of alumni and the univer-
sity.

In view of this, we have decided
to give up studies altogether and
concentrate on athletics. It is con-
ceivable that at some time in the
future we may wish to engage in
a limited program, such as intramur-
mural parallel reading. In the mean-
while, I hope you and other alumni
wil ltake justified pride in Wash-
ington and Lee as an athletic fac-
tory.
