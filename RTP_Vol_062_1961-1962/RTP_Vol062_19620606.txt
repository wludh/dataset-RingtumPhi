THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Room For Improvement In Many Aspects

By ROBERT ROY GOODWIN, II
Tuesday Edition Editor

Following a tradition established many
years ago, I, as editor of the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi, wish to leave the students, the faculty and
the Washington and Lee community a summa-
tion of the goals, the ambitions, and the ideals
I feel Washington and Lee would do well to
envision.

It is my purpose in writing this editorial
not to criticize where criticism is unwarranted,
but it is my desire that through my words
perhaps Washington and Lee can in some
small way better herself, and in the long run,
improve the men who graduate from our
University every year.

It is my sincere hope that my effort will be
met with the idea that I have the best interests
of Washington and Lee at heart—for I be-
lieve that I do.

Some areas will be discussed with more
emphasis than others. I sincerely hope that my
thoughts will be met with a sense of good
faith, for I assure my readers that it is with
the above in mind that I present my thoughts
for your acceptance or rejection.

ACADEMICS

The logical place to start any swan song
of a college career is with academics. It seems
to me that it would be sheer folly to say that
Washington and Lee can be satisfied with re-
maining the same—no institution devoted to
educating students can remain in a stagnant
form and hope to produce leaders who will
challenge our rapidly changing world.

Washington and Lee needs to realize and
to rededicate herself to the idea that she can-
not retain the status quo. In too many areas
of University life W&L has failed to realize
this idea. Washington and Lee must face the
facts that both her faculty and her physical
plant must be improved, or we only stand to
lose in the race toward academic excellence.

I am the first to realize that many improve-
ments can only come from an adequate finance
program, therefore, I can understand why
many revisions have not been made. As I have
suggested in earlier editions, Washington and
Lee needs to rejuvenate her program for ob-
taining financial help. Our Alumni should be
made to realize that it is them that we look
to. Far too often, Washington and Lee stu-
dents leave the campus never to return and
never again to be heard from.

Where can we use money for improve-
ments? The first problem immediately facing
our institution is that of faculty salaries. It

By WILLIAM LEE ROBERTS, JR.
Friday Edition Editor

This year has been one of dizzying chang-
es and announcements at Washington and Lee.
Much has been done to improve the Univer-
sity and much has been done with that hope
which we feel represents a step back rather
than an improvement.

We have criticized what seems to us a good
deal of intellectual flabbiness here and we have
seriously questioned the benefits which will
come from the new athletic conference, or
from closer faculty regulation of fraternity
and social affairs.

Through it all there seem to us to have
been several general problems which are not
so easily resolved or so simple as many the
University has. They are much more im-
portant, however.

We feel that the trustees, faculty, admin-
istration, and most of all, the students, must
face the problems of segregation and inter-
gration squarely. The entire University com-
munity has shown a ganeral lack of interest
in moral or social questions of any kind.
Race relations is the biggest moral and social
question in the United States at present, and
will continue to be for some time. It should
be a subject of active debate, both as it re-
gards W&L’s admission policy and as a gen-
eral problem with which every W&L graduate
who takes a position of leadership will have to
deal. A few courageous professors, like Dr.
Leyburn and Dr. Hodges, have ventured to
discuss the problem where it concerns their
classes. It appears to us that the men who dis-
agree with their liberal views have defaulted

is a known fact that Washington and Lee is
not famous for having the most lucrative sal-
aries, although I believe she is at present doing
an adequate job to remedy this problem. Too
many professors, who often are among the
best in their fields, leave Washington and Lee
for the benefits that can be obtained from
larger colleges and universities, among these
being larger salaries and better physical facili-
ties in which to live and work.

The matter of facilities brings us to the
second problem immediately facing Washing-
ton and Lee. I have praised the construction of
the new science building, but I believe that we
all know that this is only a beginning. Wash-
ington and Lee is hindered by a lack of ade-
quate facilities, which stands as a living testi-
mony that W&L needs more money than pre-
viously has been raised to insure the comple-
tion of mandatory projects.

It is perhaps too obvious to say that we
need a new gymnasium; to say that we need
better facilities for journalism; to say that we
need better departmental libraries, and to
assert that we desperately need improvement
in nearly all the Washington College buildings.
Even though it may seem redundant to reiter-
ate these obvious points, I believe that these
improvements must be made in the very near

future.
Ww

Washington and Lee, to come to the some-
what belated point of ‘‘Academics,” was rated
by the Chicago Tribune in 1955 as being the
ninth best small men’s college in the United
States. It would indeed be interesting to see
where we stand today. Perhaps we have ad-
vanced a notch or two (now that we have a
Commons) and perhaps we have regressed —
the question seems to be a moot one. But the
question brings to mind many policies that are
being followed by the University today which
are in many ways not in step with progress.

Among these policies, I would cite the
over preponderance of rules and regulations
which constantly haunt the student. Final
absence and over cuts—which deduct from
one’s credits for juniors and seniors, and from
one’s grade for freshmen and sophomores—
are a bit prep-schoolish, to use a neatly coined
term. A revised grading system which ensures
a larger point span would be in order, and
standing policies which in some ways inhibit
the manner in which a professor can teach a
course (namely the rule of having to give a
final examination) should be reconsidered and
revised.

Too many professors continue to rely on
their moth-eaten notes; too many professors

Is Strong;

the question by not taking open issue. Surely
there are more men in this University who
can take a well considered position on the
subject.

There is a general problem here with re-
gard to questions of values. It seems to us that
our teachers have hidden behind the
shield of ‘“‘scholarly objectivity” too long.
The best scholars and teachers here never
have, but there are far too many men on the
faculty who refuse to take a stand for fear
of being proven wrong, or even being dis-
agreed with by others. This is a disservice to
free inquiry. The professor will occupy the
focal point of learning at W&L as long as the
present course-and-hour and cut system pre-
vails. Persistent avoidance of intellectual is-
sues, through laziness, or fear, or incompe-
tence, has dulled more than one student’s in-
terest. A little scholarly controversy could be
one of the best things that could happen to
this university.

Another equally bad problem is parochial-
ism. Much has been made of the fact that
scientists and technologists have difficulty ex-
plaining the problems and questions of their
fields to men who do not have a technical
background. Yet political and business leaders
have constantly to make technical and scien-
tific decisions with the most limited under-
standing of those questions.

Washington and Lee can do a real service
to her students—and professors—by setting
up closer ties between the science departments
and the arts, business, and journalism schools.
Dr. Hughes in the history department has
done much to make his students aware of the

are content with doing only the minimum,
often overlooking the possibility of stimulat-
ing their students.

Too many professors retain the policy of
“grooving” the student, and too often pro-
fessors show partiality to students who are
majors in their departments—disregarding
talent if it happens to appear in one of their
classes simply because they are from “this”
or “that” department.

Too many professors bicker among them-
selves—overlooking the real goals of Wash-
ington and Lee—which points up the need
for more inter-departmental cooperation.

In short, academics at Washington and
Lee can and must be improved. A constant
effort must be maintained to keep the ideals
of a Liberal Arts education in mind. Curricu-
lum changes which have been made recently
are for the best, but there is still much work to
be done. I leave this work to the Washington
and Lee of 1962.

FRATERNITIES

This school year has been characterized,
at least from the standpoint of the social
fraternities, as being one of conflict between
the Administration and the IFC. Two major
occasions saw “The Hill’ move with swift
actions: namely the presenting of the faculty
rush petition and the curbing of fraternity
combos during the hours of University social
functions. Perhaps these two incidents would
not have caused so much furor had they been
handled better by both the IFC and the Uni-
versity, but this is water over the dam. I can
only hope that both parties have profited by
their mistakes.

Washington and Lee’s fraternity system is
by no means perfect. I sincerely believe that
if the fraternities wish to retain responsible
handling of their affairs, they are going to
have to realize that more interest is going to
have to be shown in the fraternity system itself
and in the IFC.

More responsible leadership is needed in
the fraternities. It is depressing to see that
only six of the 18 fraternities last semester
had averages above the all men’s figure. It is
even more discouraging to realize that many
houses have contented themselves with their
plights, and have resigned themselves to doing
little or nothing about their standing.

Another area concerning fraternities that
needs an immediate re-examination is that of
finances. Excessive spending should be elimi-
nated where it is possible, and fraternity lead-
ers must realize that not every member has
unlimited finances.

Could Be

importance of technology in history and the
Commerce School seems to be placing in-
creasing emphasis on quantitative methods in
business and economics. The mathematics de-
partment has instituted a more rigorous fresh-
man program,

These are all steps in the right direction.
We feel, however, that increased science re-
quirements for the B.A. degree, and more
courses designed to meet the needs of arts ma-
jors are the only solution. W&L is fortunate to
have strong departments in all the sciences.
We feel it would be to the advantage of our
scientists to teach more liberal arts men as
well as a great advantage to the arts men
themselves.

Parochialism is also evident in the heavy
load of vocational courses required in the
journalism and commerce departments at the
expense of the basic studies, such as history,
English, and economics, which underly the
so-called professional disciplines. It does a man
little good to take professional training in “the
liberal arts atmosphere” if this acquaintance-
ship with the liberal disciplines is unplanned
and held to only 25-30 per cent of his study.

We would press our complaints with the
faculty and administration further if the stu-
dent body showed more of the drive and ac-
complishment of which they are capable. It is
discouraging to see the prevailing extrava-
gance of money and time among students at
the expense of their undoubted academic
abilities. Men who are incapable of the most
basic social and financial discipline can hardly
be expected to show much intellectual disci-
pline. It seems to us that the student body of-

As far as the IFC is concerned, it is ob-
vious that the group needs to take a close
look at some of its functions and obligations.
It has ben said by many people that the
IFC could be the most influential group on
campus next to the EC.

The IFC and the fraternities, will never
grow in prestige if they reject the idea that
Washington and Lee does have ultimate con-
trol of fraternities and that the fraternities
don’t exercise control of Washington and Lee.

We have seen a partial re-vitalizing of the
IFC take place this year, mainly due to the
positive leadership of Bob Doenges. This
trend, if it may be called a trend, is encourag-
ing, and I hope that it is here to stay. Without
positive steps aimed at bettering Washington
and Lee first as a University and second as a
fraternity school, the IFC may find itself over-
looked when it comes to matters of student af-
fairs. I hope, however, that the fraternities
realize that they have only one way to go—
forward,

The University needs  fraternities—it
would be ridiculous to assert that W&L could
get along without them. Fraternities do indeed
provide a positive force, and they are certainly
excellent means for expressing social outlets
and comradeship, just to mention a minimum
of benefits gained from them. To remove
these forces would be a mistake, and I feel
that the Administration and a large majority
of the faculty realize the positive forces fra-
ternities can exert.

As far as Washington and Lee is con-
cerned, the direction in which we seem to be
moving is ahead. Given capable leadership
and an adequate finance program, W&L can
make even greater strides than she has in the
past.

If Washington and Lee retains ideals that
such fine men as Dean Frank J. Gilliam have
given us, we can only move in one direction—
and that direction is ahead.

w

To appreciate the combined efforts that
go into the publishing of the Ring-tum Phi,
an attempt at expression is to thank those
many students and University personnel whose
contributions have made the success of our
newspaper possible. I would like to pay partic-
ular tribute to the columnists, and to the staff
of the Tuesday Edition for their many hours
of tedious work. To Mr. Harold Lauck for
the efforts of the members of the Journalism
Lab Press, which is staffed by Lynwood Pullen,
Edward Backus, Edwin Walker and Donald
Tabbut, I am deeply grateful and indebted.

Better

ficers, fraternity leaders, and Ring-tum Phi
can expect a much stronger influence on their
fellows for greater academic and personal ac-
complishment.

We would not offer any of these criticisms
if we did not feel that the University is capable
of greater improvements, as proven by past
and present accomplishments.

We will take many happy memories, and
what we feel to be a solid educational back-
ground, with us from Washington and Lee.
Many schools can claim some of W&L’s vir-
tues but we know of no other place that com-
bines so many of them. Where can you find
a deeper and more generous mutual respect
between the students on one hand and the fac-
ulty and administration on the other? Or a
happier combination of academic pursuits with
a full social life?

At a time when concepts of honor and
duty seem to be deteriorating, we still attempt
to live up to the highest standards of person-
al honor. Despite faculty control of academic
and social matters, the student body still con-
trols the honor system and makes it work. The
inflexible assurance that our fellow students
do not lie, cheat, or steal is our greatest pride
and our greatest responsibility.

Washington and Lee means all these
things and more. It is a great university, an
educational institution known more for its
men than its institutions; proclaiming the high-
est ideals and doing its best to live up to them.

We can only express our general thanks
and hope that we have in some small way
helped to make W&L better for future gen-
erations of “General Lee’s boys.”

Washington and Lee will enroll a
freshman class this fall of approx-
imately 330 men—the largest fresh-
man class in 15 years.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam said today
that the increase over the 320 figure
set for the past fall results from the
occupancy of the new freshman dor-
mitory.

Using the new dorm, he said, will
remove the necessity of using any of
the space in Baker Dormitory for
freshmen, permit the elimination of
inadequate facilities in the present
University Place, and make unneces-~
sary the placing of a second man in
a good many of the rooms in the
main Freshman Dorm that were
originally built as single rooms.

Enrollment Largest
Dean Gilliam added that the en-

(7

 

rollment anticipated will be the
largest of any freshman class apart
from the several years immediately
following World War H, when all
colleges endeavored to make places
for as many veterans as possible.

The actual number of candidates
who have now confirmed accep-
tance is approximately 338, Dean
Gilliam added. The margin over
330 is set up to take care of any
possible cancellations.

Giving a breakdown of the
figures, Dean Gilliam said that the
next year’s class will be composed
of 58 per cent public school stu-

dents and 42 per cent from private
schools.

For the past three sessions, he

added, the figures have been fixed

 

Largest Freshman Cl

at 55 per cent public and 45 per
cent coming from private schools.
Broader Distribution

The increase in public school stu-
dents admitted indicates broader
geographical distribution, according
to Dean Gilliam. Only one public
school, Ft. Worth’s Arlington Heights
High School, is sending as many as
four boys; three are entering from
Bethesda-Chevy Chase (Md.), Ca-
tonsville (Md.), Thomas Jefferson
(Dallas), E. C. Glass (Lynchburg),
Millburn (N. J.), and Atherton
(Louisville) High Schools. Twenty-
four public schools are sending two
boys each to Washington and Lee
while single entrants will come from
131 public schools.

dents will come from Mercersburg,
Blain, Loomis, Louisville Country

and William Penn Carter.

Thirteen prep schools will pro-
vide two boys each while 37 schools
will send a single student.

Geographical distribution repre-
sented in the freshman class for
next year shows a marked increase
in the number of students from

northern, eastern and western areas.
Last year, the geographical percent-

 

will come from Southern states.

Of these, Virginia, with 60 stu-
dents, leads the field; Texas, New
Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New
York and Tennessee will be well
represented.

Richmond will send 12 students,
with Baltimore and Louisville con-

dents. Dallas, Nashville, Washington
and Short Hills, N.J., will contribute
seven boys.

Professors Cited For Teachin g Ability

TWELVE MEN PRAISED FOR AID TO W&L

By the Editors

As a feature of this Finals Edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi, the edi-
tors thought it appropriate to single
out a small group of faculty mem-
bers for their outstanding teaching
abilities which places them at the
top of the list of the best teachers
at Washington and Lee.

After a great deal of discussion—
and argument—twelve men _ were
chosen. There are a number of
other professors at W&L who are
just as competent as the men dis-
cussed here, but those we cite are
certainly representative of the best
this university has to offer.

At first glance, this group of out-
standing professors seems to have
little in common. They vary in rank
from instructor to full professor;
in age, from their late twenties to
sixtyish. Some are among the most
demanding teachers here; others
don’t ask very much for a “C.”

What they do have in common
is a contagious enthusiasm for
their field of study, a sure know-
ledge of their subject matter, and
a fair way of grading their stu-
dents,

The editors didn’t use this as a
criterion, but one of the professors
chosen has been active and influ-
ential in activities outside of class
and outside of his own field of
study. They are anything but the
ivory-tower type, giving freely of
their time as advisors to student
groups and as speakers for the var-
ious student associations.

Herewith, then, is the Ring-tum
Phi’s All-Star Teaching Team for
1961-62. We feel it is the least we
can do.

Dr. Thomas P. Hughes is probably
the most demanding professor in
the history department and one of
the most frustrating. He seldom
repeats facts in class the student can
read for himself in the thousand or
so pages of reading he assigns for
a typical upperclass course.

He also has a disconcerting habit
of giving in to a free-for-all discus-
sion in mid-lecture.

But few professors are more up
to date with the work in their

field than Dr. Hughes and few
history professors make such a de-
termined effort to get their stu-
dent to seek out the whys and
wherefores of events.

Among Dr. MHughes’s_ greatest
contributions to W&L are his con-
cern with the influence of technology
in history and his efforts to make
students more aware of this im-
portant field of study.

Dr. James K. Shillington, associate
professor of chemistry has made
himself known to the Washington
and Lee community in many ways.
The pre-med students know him
best for the almost unbelievable
amount of work he assigns, while
other students know him for his
many outside interests.

His method of lecturing is by
use of questions—a method which
insures that the work is done on
a day-to-day basis. His quizzes
are well thought out and to say
the least, they are challenging.

In addition to his knowledge of
chemistry, he is characterized by a
sincere desire to learn—not only in
his own particular field, but also
from other areas of scholarship.

Showing active participation in the
Troubadours, Dr. Shillington has
sincere literary interests which can
be seen throughout his work—in or
out of the laboratory.

Dr. Shillington also has the title
of having the most grades for his
students in his grade book.

Buford Stephenson, assistant pro-
fessor of German, has distinguished
himself as being an extremely in-
dividualistic teacher.

To say that his lectures are en-
lightening is not enough, for his
lectures would stand up to any of
those given by the other men listed
on this page.

A demanding professor who re-
quires a lot of work probably char-
acterizes Mr. Stephenson.

M
s
.

w

It is a well known fact that Mr.
Stephenson goes to great lengths to
bring in outside material to add in-
terest to his class sessions .

Mr. Stephenson’s couse in Modern
German Literature is regarded by
students as being one of the best
courses that the German department
has to offer.

Dr. James G, Leyburn has long
been known for his versatility as a
teacher, offering courses in four dif-
ferent departments, but most stu-
dents consider him to be at his best
in his introductory sociology courses
and in his course in the Greek and
Roman Classics in translation.

 

Ww

Lecturing in measured tones, Dr.
Leyburn’s eloquent treatment of
the ancient Greek values in his
“Classics” course and in his an-
cient history course always stimu-
lates his students to a closer ex-
amination of their own norms and
values,

For years he has been one of the
few professors at Washington and
Lee to point out the importance of
religion in the social sciences. He
has been one of the few to remind
us, in this day of “objective” schol-
arship, of the permeating influence
of religion in all areas of life. He

 

Ww
has been and continues to be a
great service to the University.
Then, too, we know of no one
else in the University who returns
all of the quizzes in a class of 70
in the next class period.

Many students will view the choice
of Major E. J. Roxbury as being the
surprise of the year. Upon close
examination of his work with the
ROTC department, however, the at-
titude mentioned above should fade.

Major Roxbury, in his four short
years at Washington and Lee, has
raised the level of the ROTC de-
partment from a former position of

just about being regarded as a joke,
to that of being one of the most en-
couraging to be found here.

His service to W&L in other areas
cannot go unnoticed. His active par-
ticipation in the Social Functions
Committee has helped that group
overcome many troublesome prob-
lems.

Being an informed student of the
U.S. role in military affairs, Maj.
Roxbury’s knewledge has a num-
ber of times brought him as a wel-
comed guest lecturer to many
coures.

On the basis of service to Wash-
ington and Lee—coupled with his
raising of the ROTC department—
we feel that Major Roxmury merits
our endorsement.

Suttle, Fohs Win Top Sports Awards

Two veteran Washington
and Lee football players—both
seniors—copped top honors at
the Generals’ annual all-sports
barbecue and awards presenta-
tion.

Quarterback Steve Suttle, Uvalde,
Tex., and Little All-American Ter-
ry Fohs, Baltimore, Md., were the
big trophy winners at the annual
awards event. Both were on the
1961 undefeated Washington and Lee
football team.

Valuable Player: Suttle

The Clovis Moomaw Football Tro-
phy for outstanding offensive lead-
ership and most valuable player
trophy went to Suttle, who led the
Generals as the key quarterback
and one of the tri-captains.

Fohs received the C. J. Harring-
ton Memorial Trophy for the sec-
ond year in a row as the outstand-
ing linebacker. The Trophy honors
the W&L coach killed in the sum-
mer of 1960 in an auto accident.

Sports Editor Bill Beck of the
Lynchburg News presented Fohs
with a silver bowl given by the

 

Virginia Sportswriters and Broad-
casters Association for top small col-
lege football player in the state. Rec-
ognition of Fohs’ slot on the sec-
ond team of the Little All-Ameri-
can selection by the Associated Press
also was made by Beck. The 145-
pound center won a berth on the
Third Team in 1960 and the Second
Team last fall.

Delts Win Three

Delta Tau Delta fraternity cap-
tured the top three trophies in
fraternity competition. The group
won the intercollegiate and intra-
mural trophies as well as_ the
Grand Athletic Trophy. The first
two are given on the number of
fraternity participants and the
quality of performance by each,

Eleven other seniors were pre-
sented special awards, and mono-
grams went to 185 athletes in 12
intercollegiate sports and cheerlead-
ing.

Three-letter Winners

Charley Gummey, Wilmington,
Del., again this year was the only
three-letter winner. He won mono-
grams in football, swimming and
lacrosse. A junior, Gummey was

 

 

named outstanding freshman athlete
two years ago.

The 1961-62 outstanding fresh-
man athlete award went to Louie
A. Paterno, Jr., Charleston, West
Va. He won varsity monograms in
basketball and baseball.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Editorial Staffs Laud Twelve Professors For Teaching Methods

(Continued from page 5)

The ink had barely dried on
Professor Charles F. Phillips’ Ph.D.
when he joined the W&L faculty
three years ago, but he quickly won
the respect of his students for his
clear explanation of the subtleties
of economics. Since then a growing
number of students have braved
examinations that are among the
most unpredictable in school to take
his junior and senior level courses
in government economic policy and
in the myriad implications of an
economy dominated by huge corpor-
ations,

Dr. Phillips’ great talent is in
throwing students in the middle of
conflicting economic theories rather
than presenting them with a pat
synthesis to be digested and then
promptly regurgitated on exams.
And being one of the most prolific
writers on the faculty, his students
suspect that as his ideas mature,
future W&L students may bat
around the ideas of Phillips like they
do those of the current scholar-
polemicists of economics.

Dr. Douglas Day (he received his
doctorate at the University of Vir-
ginia Sunday) has, in his two years
here as an English instructor, de-
veloped his specialties — literary
criticism and the history of the Eng-
lish novel—into two of the most pop-
ular courses in the curriculum.

Dr. Day’s classes combine well-
organized lectures with controlled
classroom discussion, His courses
are demanding, with the emphasis
on extensive outside reading.

Students who wish to talk to Dr.
Day outside the classroom never fail
to find him patient and interested.

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy’s know-
ledgeable enthusiasm for the works
of Shakespeare and the English Ro-
mantics has made his courses in their
works among the most popular in the
University.

A W&L graduate and Rhodes

 

scholar, Dr. Flournoy has a repu-
tation for being a thorough reader
of student essays.

Quite a few self-styled men of let-
ters in his courses have had their
pretensions demolished with a suc-
cinct “Pfu!” in the margins of their
papers.

Dr. Edward Turner of the physics
department is most widely known
for his teaching in the freshman
physics course. He has a _ patient
manner with freshmen who don’t
quite get the picture in physics but
is reluctant to give pat answers in
lectures or labs. The typical re-
sponse to a student asking if he
has the right figure in a lab ex-
periment is a quiet “Are you sat-
isfied?”

Another favorite phrase in de-
scribing some great experiment in
physics: “And lo and behold he
found that...”

No laboratory grind, Dr. Turner
takes an active interest in music and
drama.

Dr. Sidney Coulling, assistant pro-
fessor of English, is noted for his
highly-organized and _ stimulating
lectures—he has an uncanny knack
for making his students remember
what he says. Those students who
have had Dr. Coulling for either his
Victorian literature courses or the
advanced survey courses respect his
dedication and swear by his scholar-
ship.

His grading is scrupluously fair, but
demanding. He expects, and usually
gets, the most from his students.

Dr. Coulling is an alumnus of
W&L, and he has taken an active,
and perceptive, interest in the Uni-
versity. His editorial on the Honor
System which appeared this Fall in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi was a

definite analysis and re-affirmation
of Washington and Lee’s heritage.

Dean W. W. Pusey is known as
a very sound and fair teacher in
his elementary and _ intermediate
language courses. He manages to
sneak in a bit of dry wit to enliven
the classes from time to time.

Most students who have taken his
course in Goethe agree that it is
one of the best courses at W&L.

Dr. Milton Colvin, associate pro-
fessor of political science, has es-
tablished a reputation for brilliance
and depth in his first year at Wash-
ington and Lee. The student in his
classes gets the feeling that some
of this rubs off on him before the
end of the semester.

More than anything else, the con-
tact that a student can have with
the man is vital. He is a constant
source of guidance and encourage-

 

 

ment for those who seek it. For the

most part,

he allows his students

great width in their work in his

courses.

He is not the type of professor
that is buried in specifics. Rather,
he is concerned with the more gen-
eral things. He constantly strives to
tie together bits of knowledge that

students have learned

courses.

Craven Takes Seriously The Phrase ‘Leaving This School A Better Place Than You Found It’

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

As you all know today marks the
opening of the ceremonies, rites, and
rituals which signal the beginning.
It is traditional, I think, to spend
most of this time in praise of what-
ever school you happen to be leav-
ing. Everyone is in a good mood,

for exams are over, the summer is
ready, trips are to be taken, and
gin is cheap. Anyway there’s just no
cause to knock anything.

Far be it from me to knock any-
thing, either, just to be out of sorts
with the world. I’m in a good mood.
I’m graduating on Friday. 'm un-
employed, and I’ve got a rich, full

 

Honts Comments On Social And

Academic Changes, Improvements

By GEORGE HONTS

The year which we are closing
with this edition has seen seevr-
al significant changes in campus
life and has
heralded sev-
eral more to
come.

Those we
have’ seen
F would include
the irresponsi-
ble unbalanc-
ing of an al-
ready tilted
political situa-

3 tion; the grow-
Honts ing emphasis
on academics
(by both the Hill and the stu-
dents), to the emerging of the
IFC to the brink of the respon-
sible position it should have.

I’ve been hammering away at
the IFC for over a year now, and
the abolition of Hell Week and
the election of Ross Kyger as
president have been two moves
in the right direction.

   

Kyger’s selection of Tony
Schlesinger to head the con-
tinuing Rush Week Study Com-
mittee bears out his sincere
intention to provide the IFC
the best leadership it can find.
Hats off to Bob Doenges, and
maybe next year will be a
bright one.

Just as the face of the IFC
has changed, so is the face of the
University being altered.

The type of student that the
University has accepted for the
past two years has been vastly
different from the men who will
be graduating Friday or who
will graduate next June. In
turn, they are different from the
men who graduated three or
four years ago.

The change, be it for better
or worse, is toward the “seri-
ous” student. Men who should
know have told us that the man
with the best secondary school
marks will be getting the nod
over the high-schoolers and
prep schoolers who have less
adequate grades but who are
“well-rounded.”

Exactly what this change will
bring forth for W&L can not be
predicted. Either we shall sink
into a oblivious “happy medioc-
erity,” or we shall soar to new
heights and become “potted Ivy.”

But regardless of how we are

prone to look at the change,
everyone must admit that the
current administration is dedi-

cated to improving academic
standards, and, in doing so, has
guaranteed that W&L can offer
the college student an excellent
education.

* * %

Immense changes can be ex-

summer, maybe not next year—
but they shall come and com-
pletely alter the W&L we know
today. Once again it is difficult
to predict whether the change
will be for the better or worse—
perhaps it will depend on wheth-

You discharge your military obligation with

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

W&L’s Retiring Professors
Leave Excellent Records

During his 40-odd years on the fac-
ulty he has substituted for the Dean
of the University, the Dean of Stu-
dents, the Registrar and other uni-

Washington and Lee Professors William G. Bean and
Rupert N. Latture—both 70 years old and both a few days
away from retirement—had something in common before

they ever became faculty colleag

They were students under the*®
same college president, though at
different schools. Dr. George H.
Denny resigned the presidency of
Washington and Lee in 1912 during
the first semester of Prof. Latture’s
freshman year to head the Univer-
sity of Alabama where Dr. Bean was
a sophomore.

Since then, the two professors
have accumulated a combined total
of 82 years of active classroom teach-
ing at Washington and Lee. Liter-
ally hundreds of students have sat in
their classes since they began their
teaching careers in the early 1920's.
Dr. Bean has taught history since
1922 and Prof. Latture has been on
the political science faculty since
1920.

Both men will relinquish the heads
of their respective departments
when they step down Friday follow-
ing the university’s 213th commence-
ment.

While Prof. Latture remained at
Washington and Lee until 1916 to
obtain his M.A. degree, Dr. Bean
received his A.B. degree from Ala-
bama and went to Harvard Univer-
sity where he got his M.A. in 1916
and his Ph.D. in 1922.

Since coming to Washington and
Lee, the two professors have taught
under Presidents Henry L. Smith,
Robert H. Tucker, Francis P. Gaines
and Fred C. Cole. Both have risen
from assistant professor to professor
during their tenures.

Each of them has become a
familiar face to generations of
Washington and Lee students. Dr.
Bean has been known for his ex-
pertness in Civil War history and
Prof. Latture for his devotion to
freshman work, foreign students
and a number of student extra-
curricular organizations.

Retirement plans for the two are
tentative. Dr. Bean will continue to
teach two courses three days a
week while Prof. Latture will serve
as an adviser to the office of the
President.

Dr. Bean has a number of writ-
ing and traveling projects on his
schedule plus his garden to tend in
retirement. He married Lucy B.
Marsteller 35 years ago on May 28.
They have two sons.

An avid hiker by hobby, Dr. Bean
still will be seen on his familiar,
long walks with Dr. Ollinger Cren-
shaw, one of his freshman history
students in 1922 and the man who
succeeds him as head of the history
department. The two _ professors
spend a good part of their week-
ends strolling through the Lexing-
ton area countryside.

ues in Lexington 40 years ago.

cupation in retirement will be the
compilation of a complete history
and directory of Omicron Delta
Kappa, national honorary leader-
ship fraternity which he helped
found at Washington and Lee in
1914.

“That directory will take up a
great deal of my time,” Prof. Lat-
ture said, “but my wife and I plan
to be present for the many uni-
versity functions during the school
year.”

The Lattures—his wife is the
former Roberta Fulton—were mar-
ried July 28, 1917. They are faithful
participants in nearly every uni-
versity event. They have a son and
a daughter.

One aspect of teaching both of
the professors will not miss is the
grading of papers. They will be
happy to be relieved of that duty
so they can devote more time to
other work.

In 1959, Dr. Bean’s book, Stone-
wall’s Man: Sandie Pendleton, the
story of a young Washington Col-
lege graduate who served on the
staff of General Stonewall Jack-
son in the Civil War, was published.
He expects to have another book
ready shortly after he gives up
some of his teaching duties. Dr. Bean
is completing the final draft of a
volume about the Liberty Hall vol-
unteers, a group of Washington Col-
lege students who served with the
Stonewall Brigade in the Civil War.
He tentatively plans to title the
book “College Boys in Gray.”

An active member of the Execu-
tive Committee of the Virginia Civil
War Centennial Commission, Dr.
Bean also has contributed articles
to various historic journals and to
the Dictionary of American Biogra-
phy.

Dr. Bean feels the most significant
event in his teaching career has
been the development of a system
through which professors are given
grants for additional research and
study for books and articles as well
as class lectures.

One of the most beneficial pro-
grams for students at Washington
and Lee, Dr. Bean said, has been
the establishment of an honors
program. Candidates for honors
must prepare a thesis on a sub-
ject in their major field of study
before they can receive their de-
gree.

“It’s a little master’s program,”
Dr. Bean said about the program.
Prof. Latture has varied his teach-
ing career by aiding in a number of

ure pause and reflect on their

re this year, came to Washing-

years for the students who were not

 

 

versity officers. During World War
II, he was Dean of Students for two

in the armed forces.

He founded Washington and Lee’s
foreign students’ program in 1938
and continued as a loyal adviser
to foreign students until 1961. Each
September, his hand is extended to
welcome the new students and their
parents as they arrive at Washing-
ton and Lee’s Freshman Dormitory.
He is always on the platform for
the freshman orientation assemblies
which are held during the first two
months of each school year. Prof.
Latture constantly is a willing guide
for visitors to the university’s cam-
pus.

Prof. Latture’s name is synony-
mous with Omicron Delta Kappa on
the Washington and Lee Campus. He
has followed the organization from
its local origin with his fellow
classmates to its modern national
status. He also was one of the
founders of the modern-day uni-
versity chapter of Delta Upsilon so-
cial fraternity.

While Dr. Bean has lectured
throughout Virginia on the Civil
War, Prof. Latture has remained in
Lexington serving on the Rock-
bridge County Welfare Board and
the Board of Elders of the Presby-
terian Church. Each of them has
taken part in the activities of the
various academic organizations in
which they hold memberships.

Dr. Bean is a member of the
Southern and Virginia Historical
Associations, and Prof. Latture
holds memberships in the Ameri-
ean and Southern Political Science
Associations and the American
Sociology Society.

Both of the retiring professors are
Southerners, World War I veterans
and members of Phi Beta Kappa
and the Presbyterian Church. Dr.
Bean, a native of Heflin, Ala., served
as a lieutenant with American Ex-
peditionary Fores (AEF) in France.
In 1917-18, Prof. Latture, born near
Bristol, Va., was one of the select
members of the Foyer du Sodat, a
morale-boosting branch of the
French Army. He also served with
the AEF as an interpreter in 1918-
19 and was decorated with the
French Croix de Guerre.
