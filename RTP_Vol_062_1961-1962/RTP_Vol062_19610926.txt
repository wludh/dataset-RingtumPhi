Sean O’Faolain, Irish writer and
critic, will be the first visiting
speaker at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity this fall. He will give a
public lecture in Lee Chapel Octo-
ber 2 at 8:15 p.m.

O’Faolain’s visit to Washington
and Lee is jointly sponsored by the
W&L English department and the
Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar
Program.

Is Glasgow

Lecturer

A 33-year-old Broadway
playwright will come to Wash-
ington and Lee University
next Spring as Glasgow Visit-
ing Professor.

The appointment of Edward

Albee, who has written several
Broadway productions, was an-
nounced today by Dr. Arthur Ross
Borden, chairman of the Glasgow
Endowment Committee and profes-
sor of English.

The playwright’s stay here will
coincide with production of two of
Albee’s plays—The Zoo Story and
The American Dream—by the Wash-
ington and Lee Troubadours. He
will attend rehearsals of these plays
and advise in their production.

Albee will also conduct class-
room discussions on his plays and
contemporary drama and will de-
liver a public lecture during his
visit in May.

The Glasgow Visiting Professor
Program was established in 1957 “to
promote the art of expression by
pen and tongue.” The first Glasgow
professor was novelist Katherine

Anne Porter, who was in residence
in 1958-59.

Glasgow-sponsored literary vis-
itors last year included poet John
Ciardi, contemporary novelist Wil-
liam Humphrey and_television-
screen writer Merle Miller.

Albee wrote his first play when
he was 12. His first professional
play—The Zoo Story—was produced
in Berlin in 1959. Its first American
production was at Provincetown
Playhouse in New York. In 1959, he
wrote two plays: The Death of Bessie
Smith, also premiered in Berlin; and
The Sandbox, commissioned for the
Festival of Two Worlds at Spoleto,
Italy.

 

Students Urged To Tryout
For GE College Bowl Team

Students interested in trying for
places on Washington and Lee’s GE
College Bowl team are urged to
attend an_ introductory meeting
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Jour-
nalism lecture room in Payne Hall.

A similar meeting on Monday
drew only 12 candidates. Unless
Washington and Lee can base its
team selection on a larger number
of students, Frank Parsons says he
will recommend to President Cole
that the University withdraw its ac-
ceptance of the invitation to appear
on the CBS network television pro-
gram.

Parsons says he has appealed to
the faculty to recommend students
as potential team members, but only
a small number of responses have

Varied Scholastic Aids Offered

Woodrow Wilson

Dean William W. Pusey today
urged all interested seniors to con-
tact him as soon as possible about
possible nomination for Woodrow
Wilson Fellowships for 1961-63.

All seniors who are interested in
a career in college teaching should
discuss the fellowships at their
earliest convenience with their ma-
jor professors and with Dean Pusey,
who is campus representative for
the Fellowships. The deadline for
nominations is October 31.

The Foundation primarily selects
candidates in the humanities and
social sciences, but in exceptional
cases, when clear preference for
teaching is demonstrated, candi-
dates from the natural sciences are
also considered, he added.

A fellow receives $1,500 for the
year’s study, plus dependency al-
lowance; the Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

Four Washington and Lee seniors
received Wilson Fellowships last

June.
Ww w
Marshall and Fulbright

Applications for the Marshall and
Fulbright scholarships are now be-
ing received by Dr. Charles W.
Turner of the Washington and Lee
history department.

Dr. Turner has announced that
students interested in applying for
either of the scholarships should
contact him as soon as possible. Ap-
plications for the Fulbright grants
must be submitted by November 1,
those for the Marshall program by
October 31.

Marshall receive

scholars’ will

 

$1,540 a year plus tuition for two
years study at the university of their
choice in the United Kingdom. In
some instances the scholarship may
be extended for a third year of
study.

Those who are awarded a Ful-
bright grant generally continue their
studies in Germany, France or Eng-
land. “The university has had win-
ners each year since the inception
of this program,” Dr. Turner said.
Last year four students from the
college received grants.

In addition to the Fulbright grants,
the Institute of International Educa-
tion sponsors several scholarship
programs. For further information
students should see Dr. Turner.

Ww Ww
Rhodes

The last day for students to ap-
ply for a 1961 Rhodes Scholarship
will be Friday, September 28, Dr.
Fitzgerald Flournoy, chairman of
the faculty sub-committee on schol-
arship, said today. .

Under the scholarship, a student
is granted over $2000 a year to study
at Oxford University.

The scholarship is awarded to
those students in the junior class
or above who demonstrate best all-
around record of scholarship, char-
acter, leadership, and sportsmanship
(in athletics not necessarily on a
collegiate scale.) In addition the
student must show “promise of dis-
tinction” in some one field.

A candidate may apply in the
state where he resides or attends
college.

“The first step in applying for
the scholarship,” Dr. Flournoy men-

 

tions, “is to get the approval of
the faculty.”

At W&L the entire faculty votes
on candidates whose names and
records are submitted to the com-
mittee. This will take place at the
next faculty meeting on Oct. 2.

Dr. Flournoy, a recipient of the
scholarship in 1922, recalls that at
least three W&L students have been
Rhodes Scholars in the last ten
years. The most recent was Jon
B. McLin (’59), who is currently
studying at Oxford under this plan.

There are 32 scholarships given
each year in the U‘S., four to each of
eight districts. Included in the Vir-
ginia district are North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and
Tennessee.

Glee Club Selects
24 New Men

The 1961-62 Washington and Lee
Glee Club’s season, under direction
of Professor Robert Stewart, got un-
derway Monday evening with the
first regularly scheduled rehearsal
of the year.

Plans for the season include a
concert for Parents’ Weekend, re-
turn engagements at several of the
girls’ schools visited in the past, and
a possible Christmas program. Of-
ficers are also working on plans for
another Spring Concert Tour next
April, similar to last year’s trip to
Wilmington and Richmond.

At auditions held Thursday and
Friday of last week, twenty-four
men from the freshman class were
selected to work with the nearly
60-man club. They are: Gordon Ar-

Ireland, O’Faolain is not a stranger
to the United States. In 1960 he was
a writer in residence at Princeton
University and in 1954 he gave the
Christian Gauss lectures on con-
temporary literature at Princeton.
These lectures were later published
in his book The Vanishing Hero.

O’Faolain, a fighter in the Irish
Revolution, has become one of the
best known interpreters of Irish life.
His books on modern Ireland and
its people reflect the revolutionary
spirit.

Known For Novel

He has written biographies, his-
tories, fiction, a play, critical essays,
and translations. O’Faolain is per-
haps best known for his short stories
and his novel, A Nest of Simple
Folk.

New PE Rules

A new policy on absences from
P.E. classes has been announced by
Dean William Pusey.

(1) A general medical excuse
from all classes will be required
in order for a student to be ex-
cused from a class in Physical
Education on any particular day.

(2) Four unexcused absences are
available to students for minor
medical complaints (headaches,
colds) and other purposes. For
students with a grade point ratio
of 2.00 or better, eight unexcused
absences.

(3) Students who do not comply
with the above regulations will be
dropped with a grade of F.

(4) Elimination of the statement
in the catalogue, page 92, that “no
student is considered for honors
or for Dean’s List privileges who
is marked Incomplete in Physical
Education.”

(4) That the above go into ef-
fect on a trial basis in September
1961.

 

 

Notice

Any person with at least sopho-
more standing and an overall 1.0
average interested in being Vice-
president or assistant Business Man-

Challenges To The Fraternities:
They Must Be Dealt With Soon

The fact that 83 per cent of this year’s freshman class
pledged fraternities appears to us as being a living witness
that the fraternity system at Washington and Lee has become
stronger, and that the system does have its merits. Paramount
among these merits, we would place companionship, friendship,
and the opportunity to associate freely with one’s classmates.

We cannot, however, overlook the fact that the fraternities
should adopt some definite aims and goals which they must
attempt to reach, and that each of the houses must begin
to make their moves immediately.

Nearly everyone will agree that the academic side of
fraternity life has been slighted in past years, and that
the social whirl seems to have played the major role in
the fraternities. It is our feeling that if the system is to
prove itself worthy of being allowed to continue, then
fraternity men must begin to place more stress on the
academic work of their members. Is it not fairly obvious
that the fraternities’ cumulative grade point ratio once
again fell below the non-fraternity men’s average last
semester, and that if revision doesn’t come soon that
this surely will happen again?

The fraternity system is under constant fire nationally, and
we assert that the main reason for this is because fraternity
leaders have not exercised enough restraint in their houses,
and that many members have almost completely forgotten why
they came to college in the first place.

As far as W&L is concerned, we believe that the fra-
ternities must (1)improve their academic standing and
(2) watch their spending. Washington and Lee stu-
dents must realize that not everyone is a millionaire,
and that for many, belonging to a fraternity is an over-
whelming expense.

These two challenges must be met by the fraternities, and
they must be dealt with in the very near future. If these prob-
lems are not answered, then future students of W&L may
not have the opportunity to become fraternity men. To both
the fraternity leaders and fraternity members we offer these
challenges. The next step lies in your hands.

Hooray For The Dance Board!

It is encouraging to us that a record number of Dance
Plans have been sold, and that sales have been going well this
year. A record 801 Plans were sold by yesterday, and the
number appears to be on the rise.

Dance Board President Steve Galef’s estimation that ap-
proximately 900 Dance Plans must be sold to meet expenses
we feel merits the consideration of those who have not yet
purchased their Plans.

We believe that the Dance Board, under Galef’s
direction, has made some very definite improvements.
Among these improvements are (1) that the bands
contracted seem to be more in line with student inter-
ests, and (2) that the Board appears to have lost its
once overbearing “let’s make a pile of money” ap-
pearance. These two achievements we praise and are

thankful for.

It is not, however, only important that students simply
buy the Dance Plans, they must further lend support to the
Board by attending the dances. If the attendance at the dances
is increased this will prove to the Board that their efforts are
both appreciated and appropriate. With this assurance they
will know their work has not been in vain.

‘EMPHASIS’ TO BEGIN IN TWO WEEKS

Emphasis, a new series of articles
which will deal with various phases
of W&L life, will appear in this
year’s Tuesday Edition. The first
series will begin in two weeks and

will be written by Associate Editor
Bill Bowen. The series considers
“The Academic Toughness of W&L.”
It is our hope that both faculty and
students will enjoy Emphasis.

 

 

FLAVORS FROM ONION TO SHRIMP

 

Chips And Dip -- Rush Gimmick

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

Thank God rush week is over.
Maybe I’m just getting old, but
each one of them seems to be less
inviting. I’ve seen four rush weeks,
including one as a rushee, and this
last one was the worse one of
all.... Mostly because a majority
of the freshmen seemed to have

brains and seemed to be using
them.

Rushing was a lot easier four
years ago I’m sure. The fresh-
men then didn’t think. Not only
that, each house had its very own
speciality then. I remember one
house was selling regionalism. All
the fraters at another house should
have worn their coats inside out.

 

Varied Beliefs
Dismember Us

This I believe...

In this era, unrivaled by any other in terms of destructive
potentiality, I think that I am not alone in comparing myself
to a dismembered figure that has been rent asunder by beliefs

as variable as the weather.

The diversity in conviction is *
exemplified by the individual who
builds a bombshelter from which
he releases a covey of doves to
search the distant corners of the
world for an olive branch taken
from the tree of perpetual peace.

To whom do we turn in these
trying times for answers to the all-
important questions concerning our
future. I find myself completely
befuddled by the wide variety of
opinions offered “by people who
know.” For every authority that
advocates limited warfare there is
another who swears that our only
hope is to survive the nuclear at-
tack which is “just around the
corner.”

I do not know whether to issue
forth with a puzzled laugh or a fear-
ful cry when the first article I read
relates with “high” optimism the
possibilities behind a nuclear test
ban while, on the second page, an-
other review states that the only
thing “high” is the amount of radio-
activity in the air.

Perhaps there are no exact an-
swers to the seemingly paradoxical
situations and beliefs which plague
the world of today. I, for one, find
my opinions based on faith rather
than fact and, therefore, refrain
from offering any semblance of a
solution in regard to this sea of
judgments.

It is best not to evaluate or
scrutinize each particular belief
but rather to attempt an under-
standing of the environments and
events which produce the multi-
farious trends of thought. The
eminent historian, Arnold J.
Toynbee, portrays a striking al-
legory concerning the milieu of
the modern world when he writes
of the “six young Scandinavian
seafarers” who set sail across the
Pacific Ocean on the raft Kon-
Tiki:

“Beyond the line of surf breaking
over this barrier the approaching
seafarers could descry the feathery
tops of palm-trees, and they knew
these palms bedecked idyllic isles
set in a still lagoon; but between
them and this haven ran the foam-
ing and thundering reef, and the
set of the current and the wind gave
the voyagers no chance of circum-
navigation. They were heading per-
force towards an inevitable ordeal;
and, though they might know what
were the alternatives awaiting any
voyagers in this plight, they could
not guess which of these alternatives
was to be the ending of their own
saga.”

By Dave Knight, Columnist

 

All they had to sell was a Brooks
Brothers label. A third house
didn’t even have that. ...all they
offered was Country Club by the
six pack. Their pledge pins resem-
ble a beer barrel, but oddly none
of the members there drank, as
well as I can remember.

Another house kept a bleached-
blonde around. She did all the
rushing, but I never did know who
she was supposed to belong to.
I didn’t get a bid so I can’t com-
ment on their mystic rites either.
Then there was a house that did
nothing but sing. I still wonder
whether they were a bunch of
Sinatras or Liberaces. And an-
other house had a closet case. Not
boys, athletic trophies. I bet they
had a hundred of them in reserve.

The picture is all muddled now.
The blonde is still around but
she’s not selling fraternities any
more. The house with the trophies
must have had a sale, everybody’s
got one this year. Country Club

has gone out of style and no one
has been to Brooks Brothers since
last Thanksgiving. And everybody
was singing this rush week. It
sounded like a Holy Roller Re-
vival Wednesday night.

Apparently the big sell this year
was on potato chip dip. Every
house has its own special recipe—
they range from blue cheese to
onion to shrimp and back again.

Before any freshman was bid at
any house, he had to first give a
satisfactory answer to “How do
you like our potato chip dip.”
If the kid didn’t like it he was
an immediate cool-job and was
pushed toward whatever house
was the big rival at the moment.
I guess the fraters figure the other
house would be getting what it
deserved.

Fraternities have, or should
have, a very definite place in the
social and academic life of every
college man. If a freshman really
likes beer and dip, then sell him
on beer and dip. Personally, after
nursing the battle scars of four
rush weeks, it seems to me to be
an insult to the intelligence of
youth to give freshmen the rush
job they get. Most of them must
get awfully tired of all that dip.

* *

LAST YEAR there was much
talk on the honor system being
over-loaded. The trouble centered
around the Dance Board edict
making dance plan transfers dis-
honorable. The Board finally had
to back down on its decision and
now it is doing the job it is sup-
posed to do—get some entertain-
ing entertainment for the dance
weekends. The honor system,
though, is still expanding, but
in different directions. Doc has
now installed a change-for-the-
new-cigarette machine honor sys-
tem of his own. Isn’t it amazing
what the machine has done to

 

make gentlemen of us.

With Smile, Quick Joke, Helping Hand
Bob Murray Wins Students’ Respect

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

It is often said that Big Brother
watches over us.

Washington and Lee has a big
brother, and he does watch over
the students. But he doesn’t track
the students like a hawk relentless-
ly hunting an unsuspecting prey.
Instead he acts as a friend.

W&L’s big brother is C. F.
“Bob” Murray, the university
proctor.

When the university hired Murray
a lieutenant on the Lexington po-
lice force in 1958, it said his duties
would be “to help the students not
police them.”

Some students, however, took a
different attitude.

“We don’t want a cop. Why do
do we need a cop?” were some of
the comments.

But Murray came to the campus
with his big smile and a quick joke
and soon won the students’ friend-
ship and respect. Soon students
began to return that friendly smile
and many greet him as “Bob.”

In fact after only two weeks as
proctor, the Ring-tum Phi praised
Murray. It stated editorially that

respect and loyal friendship of a, versity rules when necessary. His

wish him every success.”

Murray’s job covers everything
from student parking to student
conduct; and he enforces the uni-

Volume Two, Number One

It seems very natural to start out the second year of
these columns with a weleome back to all the flunkies who
got reinstated, and a traditional hello to the freshmen. May-
be I should just print a great big HI in italics, and then I
won’t have to speak to anyone except tourists and the people
who don’t read the Ring-tum Phi.

These non-readers are the subject of much discussion in
the pine-panelled editorial office of the Tuesday Edition
and after calling a Madison Avenue market analysis firm,
we've decided to start a circulation war with Friday. That
is, the war will be with the Friday Edition, for Friday itself
is circulated enough as it is.

In a preliminary study we (Roy Goodwin and my-
self) found that in several instances the Tuesday Edi-
tion is already way out in front.

For instance, there are more issues of our paper in the
seats of the Lyric than any other journal—except the Rock-

  

See EE Eee

RES IPSA LOQUITUR

 

bridge Gazette. Also there are more Tuesday Editions found
in fraternity garbage cans on Wednesday morning than any
other times—except Saturday when the Friday paper takes
a slight lead.

We plan to remedy this by withholding half of our circu-
lation list until late Friday night. Without boasting I be-
lieve that I may say that within a week or two the local
garbage collectors can count on the Tuesday Edition leading
the field every morning.

Of course any circulation war needs some bright
new features. In this line we have decided to offer
our readers a monthly bonus which the Friday Edition
cannot hope to compete with. This bonus will be on a
limited edition basis only, and will be sold at Mc-
Crum’s exclusively. It will be called Playboy.

Another area in which Roy and I noticed room for im-
provement was the wrapping department. Hence the Tuesday
Edition will print every hundredth copy on an old brown
bag from the ABC store. This will help to promote the utili-
tarian aspects of our paper.

occasions when crucial yardage was
needed. Coach McLaughlin praised
Suttle for his field leadership and
ballhandling as well as his fine
blocking.

Coach Mac also pointed to the
play in which Suttle picked up a
loose ball and completed an eight
yard pass, as typical of Suttle’s
quick thinking.

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

Hampden-Sydney came awfully
close to marring Washington and
Lee’s 1961 football record in the
opening game Saturday.

Just how close the Tigers came
to grabbing a 6-6 tie, few of the
3,000 fans at Wilson Field realized.

Halfback Jim Russ, one of
W&L’s many heroes, dived over
from the two with 4:12 left in
the third period to tie the score.
Then he dropped back to try the
winning extra point. His boot
sailed perfectly through the up-
rights, but there’s an unusual
story behind this all important
kick.

 

“I wasn’t ready to kick,” Russ
said after the game. “I was practic-
ing my timing when I suddenly
hear ‘hike, hike’.”

Lady Luck seemed to have spread
an invisible cloak of luck across
Wilson Field in the fateful third
period.

The Generals marched 64 yards in
short, stubby chunks for the 7-6
vietory and needed all the luck they
could muster.

Twice it appeared that the
Hampden-Sydney defense had
choked W&L’s slow-motion ground
attack, but quarterback Steve
Suttle kept the Generals alive
with a pair of short passes.

With fourth down and six yards to

go at the Hampden-Sydney 26, Sut-
tle fired an aerial strike to fullback
Tommy Keesee at the 19. Then with
fourth and six to go at the H-S 15,
Suttle again took to the air lanes.
But it took a leaping catch by Russ
at the eight to get the first down.

Three plays later, Russ made
W&L’s third straight clutch fourth
down play as he dived for the touch-
down from the two.

The Generals came up with the
do-or-die play three times in their
drive, but they lacked the big play
that propelled them to their 8-0-1
record last year.

The first half was a story of
flustration for W&L while the sec-
ond half was an unsuspected de-
light of staunch defense by the
gold or third team.

Only once did the Generals move
beyond the H-S 45-yard line in
the first half. That drive carried to
the 34 where fullback Doug Martin
fumbled.

H-S end Tony Rucker recovered
the fumble and started the Tigers
on their only scoring march.

One play later halfback Lewis
Everette, blasting off like a rocket,
set his sights on the W&L end zone.
But Wayne Bradshaw pulled him
down from behind after a 36-yard
gallop at the W&L 31.

 

Generals Edge By H-S Tigers 7-6

The Tigers scored nine plays later
on a seven-yard pass from quarter-
back Stuart Shelton to end Bobby
Saylor.

But guard Bob Payne crashed
through the H-S defenders and
blocked Fred Mitchell's try for
the extra point.

Hampden-Sydney, which rolled
up 105 yards in total offense the
first half, returned to the field
after intermission confident of a
victory.

But they hadn’t tried to run
against W&L’s Chinese Bandits
(Gold team) before.

The Bandits, a mixture of soph-
omores, juniors, and seniors, stop-
ped the Tigers cold. In fact,
Hampden-Sydney ended up with
a minus ten yards total offense
for the second half.

The Tigers’ passing attack, which
had been effective in the clutch in
the first half, couldn’t even get into
the air against the Bandits.

Not once, but three times the
Bandits threw H-S’s quarterbacks
Shelton and Mitchell for long losses
when they tried to pass.

Terry Fohs, the Generals’ line-
backer, was credited with 11 tackles
in the game, although he played just
half the game on defense. Terry
didn’t see much second-half action.

Community Work Keynotes UCA

By KEN LANE

President of the University Chris- |
tian Association, Pete Agelesto, an- |
nounced that this year the organiza- |
tion is initiating a new approach in
its program.

The UCA has altered its policy in|
order to present a more stimulating |
challenge to students. “The empha- |
sis,’ Agelasto states, “is now on}
work of a more constructive and |
worthwhile nature. In the past few |
years, the organization has given |
the impression of inertia and stag-|
nancy. The changes inaugurated this
year should arouse a more spirited
interest.”

Community service will be the

keynote of UCA activity. Projects |
will include home construction, food |
distribution, and a Big Brother pro- |
gram in which members work with |

troubled boys. Class instruction and |

other assistance will be given to

| neighboring mountain churches. The
Boy’s Club, in which area youngsters
| are coached in athletics, is of major
| interest.

Of popular interest are the dis-

| cussion panels and seminars to be

conducted in the course of the year.
Dealing with current controversial
topics, these serve as a nucleus for
stimulating discussion.

On the purpose of the UCA, Age-
lasto remarked that “it functions for
better understanding on questions

X-C Team Meets
Pfeiffer Friday

The Cross-Country team has been
practicing for a week preparing for
their opening meet with Pfeiffer Col-
lege this Friday.

Three Starters Return

Coach Miller has lost some of his
top runners, but Mike Shank, Norm
Youngblood, and Bruce MacDonald
are returning to their starting posi-
tions.

Mac Brownlee, a transfer last
year from Davidson is going to
bolster the starting seven. As a
freshman at Davidson he was one
of the best in the Southern Con-
ference.

Twenty-five men are trying out for
the team including ten promising
freshmen.

Again this year Coach Miller feels
that Franklin and Marshall and
Lynchburg College will provide the
stiffest competition for the W&L
runners.

Coach Miller has scheduled time
trials for Wednesday and Thursday
of this week to decide the starting
seven for Friday.
