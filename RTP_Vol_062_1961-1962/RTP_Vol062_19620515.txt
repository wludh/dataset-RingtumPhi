W&L Receives Research Grant
For Development In Science

A grant of $30,000 to Washington
and Lee University from the Re-
search Corporation of New York
was announced today by President
Fred C. Cole.

Washington and Lee will use the
grant to strengthen its science pro-
gram through the addition of criti-
cally-needed professors to its science
faculty, President Cole said. The
sum is to be expended at the rate
of $15,000, annually over a two-year
period, he added.

Cole States

President Cole said the grant to
Washington and Lee reflects a recent
shift in the Research Corporation’s
policy which now enables the phil-

creasing amounts of its resources to

Book Out
By Leyburn

The University of North
Carolina Press has published

Dr. James G. Leyburn’s book
entitled The Scotch-Irish: A
Social History. The volume is
scheduled for distribution be-
ginning May 26.

in thin book, Dr. Leyburn
traces the three principal chap-
ters of the progress of the Scotch-
Irish including their life in Scotland,
their removal to Northern Ireland
and their migrations to America. He
dispels much of what he terms the
“mythology” of the Scotch-Irish.

A member of the Washington and
Lee faculty since 1947, Dr. Leyburn
is the author of The Haitian People,
which, in 1942, won the Anisfield-

 

Wolf Award for the best book on
race relations in the preceding
year.

Dr. Leyburn came to Washing-

ton and Lee from Yale University
where he had taught for 20 years,
rising from instructor to professor
of sociology. He was Dean of the
University at Wushington and Lee
from 1947 until 1956, when he
resumed fulllime teaching.
Degrees
He holds A.B. and A.M.
economics from Trinity Collens
Duke University and A.M.
degree in economics from Princeton
University. He received his Ph.D.
degree in sociology from Yale in
1927, joining the faculty of that |

IFC DECIDES T0 ABOLISH HELL WEEK

Ross Kyger To Serve As

New [FC

By STEVE

President

GUILD

Managing Editor

In an hour-long meeting

last night the Interfraternity

Council abolished all forms of Hell Week or Help Week. The

action followed the defeat of th
been submitted to the IFC two

e proposed rush plan that had
weeks ago by the Rush Week

Study Committee. After the discussion of the rush plan Ross

Kyger was elected
of the IFC.

The proposed rush plan was be-
fore the IFC for the second week
in a row. Last week the plan re-
ceived the necessary two-thirds vote
for any change or amendment to the
IFC constitution. The vote for the
plan in last week’s meeting was 13-4 |
but in the ensuing week several
houses found weaknesses or changed
their minds about the plan and the |
final vote was 10-8.

Hell Week Abolished

As soon as the Rush proposal was
was defeated there was a motion to,
extract the portion of the proposal,
section A, which reads that all forms |
of Hell Week or Help Week shall be}
immediately abolished. The motion |
passed by a vote of 14-4. This means
for the fraternities that the first |
week in the second semester that has |
been traditionally reserved for con- |
centrated hazing of pledges will be
abolished. There are several details
in this that must still be worked
out, as was pointed out by several
members of the IFC. This will be
done the first of next year by either
the IFC or a special committee.

new president*

 

Reasons for Defeat

The principal reason for the de-
feat of the plan was not the general
outline of the plan but the specific
points that must be worked out in
the new system. Such things as open
house parties the first four to five
weeks, the handling of pledge ac-
tivities, and methods of controlling
dirty rush were mentioned as rea-
sons. Other houses feel there would
be a concentration of good pledges
in only a few houses under the new
proposals.

After the plan had been defeated,
George Honts, chairman of the Rush
Week Study Committee, proposed
that either the plan be put into effect
on a two-year trial basis, which
would still require the 2/3 vote or
recommend to the IFC that the
Committee continue their study next

spots in the plan.

The Council finally decided, after
a motion by Honts, that the IFC
feels that “the present plan is in-
complete in its present form and
recommends that a rush week study
will be continued in the fall under
the direction of a special commit-
tee.”

It was also suggested after this
motion passed unanimously that
the Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities be notified of this action
and the reasons behind it by the
president of the IFC and members
of the Rush Week Committee.

Dean Atwood, advisor to the IFC,
emphasized that the Faculty Com-
mittee would look with favor upon
this action and the IFC’s willingness
to study the problem further, and

| would take no action on the Rush

Week situation as long as it was
being considered by the IFC.

New Officers

Following the discussion of the
rush plan, election of next year’s
officers was held. Ross Kyger, Kappa
Sig rising senior was elected presi-
dent over Bill Young, DU. Other
officers are Conway Shields, PiKA
rising junior, vice president; George
Craddock, Beta rising junior, sec-
retary; Bob Hart, SAE rising senior,
treasurer; IFC rush chairman, Tony
Schlesinger. ZBT rising senior; and
IFC rush book editor, Pete Alford,
Phi Psi rising junior.

Dean Atwood

Other business taken up by the
IFC was a statement by Dean At-
wood that a post script to a letter
by C. C. Gilmore (see page 2) to
all the fraternities at W&L said,
“Resist any change in the present
system. Take your case to Dr. Cole.”
Atwood wanted to make clear that
President Cole is neither for nor
against, that he has assumed a com-

als Dance Set, he and his vice-pres-
idents will be able “to throw

It’s Up To The Individual

One must realize that the freshman courses of instruction
are necessarily basic and limited. One must secure a firm foun-

been filled with news of the

large number of freshmen that plan to leave Washington and
Lee at the end of the semester. Various causes have been listed

and numerous excuses offered.

A closer study of the problem will reveal that most of the
current rumors are false. It has been stated that “approximately
25 freshmen left W&L on their own accord at the end of the

first semester.”

However, official figures from the registrar and

the Dean of the College show a completely different picture.

Official figures obtained from the Registrar’s office show
only 16 freshmen present during the first semester that
were not in attendance at the beginning of the second semester.
Of these, 9 fell under the Automatic Rule, and three left dur-
ing the first semester. Thus only four freshmen withdrew vol-
untarily at the end of the first semester.

Furthermore, these figures

do not bear out the “‘rumor”’

that 30 or so will leave at the end of the semester. Only seven
freshmen have failed to register for next year. This is quite
a different picture from that which has been recently presented.

To those who have decided to leave and to those who are

thinking of leaving, there are a

few points that merit consider-

eration. First, a problem is never solved by running away.
Those who say that this school does not create an atmosphere
of intellectualism should stop to examine themselves and the

charges.
EES

To the Editor:

In my letter last week I called
W&L a “post-graduate High School.”
This was a rather sweeping general-
ization, yet I feel that I can support
it with some specific, rational criti-
cisims, I admit that my letter was
emotional and generalized, but I did
this on purpose, in order to achieve
a shock effect. I feel that there is a
rather smug and complacent atti-
tude on this campus which needs to
be jolted into an awareness of cur-
rent problems.

In order to understand the basis
for my criticism, each student must
ask himself the following question:
“Why am I at college?”

I believe that a college exists for
one reason only—for the purpose
of educating its students. Hence,
the students have only one pur-
pose at College—to get an educa-
tion, and all other considerations
are secondary,

I do not believe that students are
pursuing this ideal. They seem to
be more interested in having a good
time than in getting an education.
I have noticed an appalling lack of
interest in the pursuit of knowledge.
Where have I noticed this? Allow
me to cite a few specific examples.

Uusually they are talking about last
weekend, the coming weekend, a trip

ject. Never do you hear students dis-
cussing any matter of real signifi-
cance.

I have also found that very few
students here ever read a book just
for the hell of it, or for no other
reason than the fact that they heard
it was a good book and were curious
to read it. I feel that this is very im-

mary goals of education—to create well rounded individuals.

This can not be accomplished in
a proper mixture of work and

the class room alone. However,
play is necessary. Here, good

judgment and maturity are needed. There are those who never

Similarly, it has been stated that W&L is too small and
does not offer sufficient opportunities for intellectual develop-
ment. This is ridiculous. Let those who want to go to a large
university go. There they will become a number instead of a

name. They will also have unl

imited courses from which to

choose—courses in such intellectual fields as relaxation and

hotel management.
Those that claim that W&L

does not offer enough courses

in their field should examine themselves and the situation. Each

prospective freshman receives a

should continue between classes, at
the dinner table, and during most
of the student’s free time.

Now I do not feel that a student
should deny himself all forms of
relaxation. A date, a drink, a flick,
is all right just as long as it does
not become a way of life. However,
I feel that pleasure seeking has
become a way of life on this cam-
pus.

lack of self-criticism on this campus.

Free Time

This brings up the whole question
of the use of free time. How does
the average W&L gentleman spend
his free time? Well, he probably
either goes to a flick, drinks a
couple of beers, goes down the road,
or indulges in some similar form of
pleasure-seeking. Rarely does he
utilize his free time to further his
education. I take an extreme posi-

Finals Dance In

Will End Seniors’ Year

By FRANK YOUNG

Washington and Lee’s 1962 Finals
Dance weekend will present a new
concept in Univer-
sity sponsored
functions. This
concept will take
the form of a Sen-
_ ior Ball to be held
' Thursday _ night,
June 7, from 10
to 12 in the Evans
_ Dining Hall.

The purpose of
the Senior Ball is
primarily to give
the graduating
seniors an opportunity to entertain
their parents in a somewhat more
sophisticated manner than the fra-
ternity combo parties might allow.
“ach June, hundreds of parents flock
to Lexington in hopes of sharing
their son’s last few college days with
him. In years past, the entertainment
of these parents has been relatively
neglected, with drab Lexington of-
fering little for their amusement.

 

Young :

To Follow Reception

This year’s Ball will be held the
night before graduation and will im-
mediately follow President Cole’s
Senior reception. The dance will
give the seniors and their parents a
further opportunity to mingle with
other parents and faculty members
who will attend.

Although the Graduation Ball is
primarily held in honor of the sen-
iors and their parents, underclass-
men are urged to attend. As the

dress for seniors at President Cole’s
reception will be formal, seniors at-
tending the dance must be formally
attired. Underclassmen and parents,
however, will be admitted to the
dance in semi-formal dress. The par-
ents and friends of graduating sen-
iors who own a Dance Plan will be
admitted to the Ball free of charge.

Decorations

Decorations for the Senior Ball
will be moderate, as the atmosphere
of the Dining Hall itself is sufficient
setting for a farewell dance. The
Dance figure will be held at 11
o'clock and will include the Presi-
dent of Finals Dances, Jack Varda-
man, his vice presidents, and the
officers of this year’s senior class.

Tables will be arranged on sides
of the Ball Room where spectators
may relax and view the festivities.
Punch will be served on the baleony
of the Dining Hall.

Finals Concert

The recent signing of Fats Domino
to play for the concert Tuesday night,
June 5, has apparently met with stu-
dent approval. Domino has long
been a favorite among rock and
roll adherents, and his performance
is reportedly a riotous one. He is
bringing his full rock and roll back-
up band to support him.

The Domino Concert coupled with
the Senior Ball and various frater-
nity parties should render this year’s
Finals Dances a successful one which
the graduating seniors and _ their

 

parents will long remember.

that everything is all right, and that
there is no room for improvement.
This is an unhealthy attitude for
any institution to take. Even the
best institutions should be constant-
ly striving to improve. If we are so
smug and complacent as to believe
that there is no room for criticism
or improvement then we have sealed
our own tragic fate.

Separate but Equal

I do not agree with the idea that
the academic and social aspects of
a college can exist “separate but
equal.” One, of necessity, will in-
trude upon the other. If we are to
be the leaders of tomorrow, then we
had better start preparing ourselves
today. I feel that we can best pre-
pare ourselves in the classrooms and
in the library rather than in the
Paramount or in a fraternity base-
ment.

As a result of the increased com-
petition for college admissions, we
are getting a higher caliber of stu-
dent every year. We must adapt to
meet the demands made by these
students. Obviously, a number of
highly qualified freshmen have found
W&L unsuitable for their needs and
are leaving. W&L can no longer af-
ford to cling to its way of life.

Those who advocate such a policy
are oblivious to the inexorable
changes that are taking place. I am |
appalled at the number of students |
here who would cling to the past.
That is why I encourage more strong
action on the part of the Administra-
tion. If the students cannot act in-
telligently, then the Administration
must act for them.

W&L could be the best college
in the nation. It could provide dy-
namic leadership for the South es-
pecially. But if this is to come about,
“there'll have to be some changes
made.”

IFC’s | &

 

By GEORGE HONTS

There a lot of things we will re-
member about our college careers
in the years to come. I for one
will not soon forget the first man I
met when I walked into the Fresh-
man Dormitory quadrangle for the
first time—a poorly prepared, scared
freshman. That man was Rupert N.
Latture.

Mr. Latture is retiring this June
after a 50-year association with
Washington and Lee University. I
spent the better part of a day
browsing around the hall talking to
his colleagues, men who have work-
ed with him for a number of years
and men who have known him for
only a relatively short time. Their
sentiments are best expressed in a
quote jotted down in Dr. Cole’s of-
fice. “He is a man,” the President
said, “who has been deeply devoted
to the University.”

Praise
Another colleague made this state-
ment about his services, “Prof. Lat-
ture’s 50 years at W&L have been
characterized by interest and faith.”

Most of us probably don’t real-
lize it, but Prof. Latture has serv-
ed a lengthy term on the faculty
administrative committee where he
has time after time “gone to bat”
for students who have gotten
themselves in trouble. His efferts
have saved several students’ aca-
demic lives, but like everything he
has done, this work was done in
a quiet, modest manner so no one
would ever know.

Prof. Latture came to Washington
and Lee University in 1912. He grad-
uated valedictorian of the class of
1915 after serving a term as vice
president of the Student Body and
being active in the YMCA, the fore-
runner of the present University

 

Christian Association.

 

dation upon which to build. This is true no matter where you

go. It is, therefore, unfair to

criticize our school on these

grounds before all of the facts are known.

Those who make these charges against our University have
only themselves to blame. One gets out of a school what one
puts into it. Here, there are virtually unlimited opportunities
for intellectual advancement. One only has to make effort on

his own to find them.

A Job Well Done

The election of Ross Kyger as president of the IFC closes
out a successful term of office for Bob Doenges, this year’s
president of the IFC. Doenges has directed the IFC through a

most trying and successful year.

Many of the pressing problems that face fraternities were
topics of debate. Under the able leadership of Doenges, many
of the problems were brought to a successful conclusion.

Last night his year in office was terminated by the passage of
a resolution that ended Hell Week. This motion was successful
largely because of the efforts of Doenges.

Bob Doenges deserves a vote of thanks from the entire
student body for his untiring efforts and devotion to W&L and

its fraternities.

Mr. Latture’ 5 Career Is Marked
By ODK And Modest Manner

On the 28th of August, 1917,
Prof. Latture married Roberta
Fulton. They have two children,
Mrs. George Woolfenden of Birm-
ingham, Ala., and William E. Lat-
ture of Oneonta, Ala.

Mr. Latture joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1920. He was
elevated to Associate Professor in
1925 and to full professor in 1941,
the same year he was named head
of the Political Science department.
During his first four years here, Mr.
Latture taught French—a language
he was well qualified to give in-
struction in, as we shall see.

French Army

During 1917-18 Mr. Latture was
assigned to the French Army in a
quasi-military capacity. He told me
the other night that when Gen.

 

 

 

Mr, Rupert N. Latture

 

Pershing reached Paris he found the
French morale extremely low and
German propaganda very intense.
Prof. Latture and one hundred other
French-speaking Americans were
attached to the French Army and
worked “in the danger zone” near
the front to educate the French on
what America was doing to help the
Allied cause and to boost the mor-
ale.

He operated near the front with-
out the benefit of a uniform—which
would mean that if he were cap-
tured he would be without the bene-
fits of normal Prisoners of War. Mr.
Latture’s services earned him a
Croix de France—the equivalent of
an American Decoration for Meri-
tous Service—in 1918. In 1918 Mr.
Latture enlisted in the American
Army in Paris and served with the
Allied Expenditary Forces through
1919.

42 Years

During the 42 years which Prof.
Latture has lived in Lexington and
W&L he has quietly taken part in
many civic and University projects.
He has for years been responsible
for the freshman assembly program
which helps assimilate freshmen into
the university by a series of meetings
every September. He served as Sup-

For a couple of weeks now I’ve
been keeping my ear to the ground
in order to hear some of the rum-
blings that have been reported to be
coming from the freshmen. In four
years here I’ve noticed that fresh-
men rumble quite a bit, especially
just before lunch-time, but I’ve al-
ways taken it for granted that it was
just because they skipped breakfast.
At least when I was a freshman
that’s what caused most of my rum-
blings.

But currently the rumblings have
taken on a different tone—that of
_.. leaving dear old

W&L for sunnier
climes—so I took
it on_ myself
to investigate. As
I said, my ear was

on it. Rising to the occasion, I got
him into a deep conversation about
the causes for the rumored exodus.
I said:

T. C.: What's all this jazz you
guys are spreading around about
leaving school in June. I under-

stand you don’t approve of the gen-
eral situation around here, Is that
right?

Freshman: Well, it’s actually not
that simple. I mean, we're leaving,
but it’s hard to say why. I mean,
once you start to think about it
there is such a complex of forces
and motives at work here that it’s
really rather hard to say, flatly, ex-
actly why we’re leaving.

TC: Well, why don’t you give it
a whirl anyway! You know, start
talking and maybe something will
come out. What don’t you like about
W&L?

FR:

I was tricked into coming here,

in the first place, I mean, like I
wanted to go to Princeton but I
wasn’t accepted. So I really had no

choice. From the first, then, you can

see, I was deprived of my free will,

And I’ve got ambition, I want to be
a drill-punch operator in my father’s

this school as one which could give

to build on, you might say.

TC: No,
anyway.

FR: O.K., well what I mean is, I
get here and this town is dead as a
doornail, you know what I mean.
And you know what I mean. And
then all the emphasis is placed on
the social, and not on the academic.
Now that’s something I don’t like.
I mean, I like to study, and I just
can’t do it with the pin-ball ma-
chine in the Co-op so close. You
know, it ruins my concentration.
And the courses that freshmen have

Five Goals In First Period
Carry Duke Over W GL

By NICK MONSARRAT
A poor first quarter spelled dis-
aster for the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team Saturday as they were
handed their tenth defeat of the sea-
son, 6-4, by Duke University.

Lack of conditioning on the
Duke team should have ended in
the Generals’ favor but a five goal
Duke attack in the first period
sent them well on the way to vic-
tory. The Generals were only able

Set For May 23

The Washington and Lee athletic
banquet will be held at Coach Mc-
Laughlin’s camp, May 23, from 4:30
to 6:30 p.m.

Athletic Director, Cy Twombly,
said the banquet has been moved
from Captain Dick Smith’s because
of the lack of shelter and a poor
entrance road, The road is of clay
and if it should rain becomes in-
accessible.

Awards

All letters and special awards will
be handed out at the banquet. Some
of the more prominent trophies to
be presented are: the Captain Dick
Smith trophy for baseball, the Ty
Rauber, Dan Justice and Charlie
Harrington football trophies.

The Lee Williams _ basketball
trophy, in memory of one of the
greatest athletes in the school’s his-
tory, is to be presented to the most

valuable basketball player of the
season.
The Most Valuable athlete

award goes to the Senior who has
shown the most spirit, ability and
sportsmanship in any sport at
Washington and Lee.

The most spirited member of the
student body will receive the Wink
Glasgow Trophy.

All Intramural awards will be
given at this banquet. All member of
varsity squads are invited, athletes
and managers alike.

To W&M By 5-3

By AL JOHNSTON

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team lost to Norfolk Division of Wil-
liam and Mary by a score of 5-3
here yesterday.

It was the Generals’ final game
of the season. The team has thus
compiled a record of one win, twelve
losses and one tie.

William and Mary’s John Wal-
ton pitched the entire nine innings,
striking out five, walking three and
allowing eight W&L hits.

Phil Sharp started for the Gen-
erals but was relieved after 2 1/3
innings by Mason McGowin.

McGowin was taken out at the
end of the fifth and replaced by a
freshman left-hander, Chris Wigert.
He took the mound until the ninth
inning and was then relieved by
another freshman, Lou Paterno who
pitched the final two outs of the
season. Together, they allowed six
W&M hits but four of their five
runs were unearned.

 

Don Parks and John Zadell were
the leading hitters for W&M with
two apiece. W&L’s Chuck Lane |
and Ashley Allen both were two
for four to lead the Generals at |
the plate.

One of the winning runs was
scored in the eighth when Zodell |

flied out ending the inning.

6-2; W&L Suffers
Eleventh Defeat

By C. C. HARDWICK
The Generals were defeated, 6-2,
by the Hampden-Sydney Tigers last
Saturday in Death Valley.

The first W&L run was scored
by Park Gilmore in the first in-
ning. After hitting a triple, Gil-
more was driven in on a sacrifice
fiy ball hit by Russ.

In the six inning, Ned Hobbs, on
with a single, stole second and then
scored the second run when Louis
Flanagan singled.

The Generals had five
against eight for the Tigers.

Hampden-Sidney was led to vic-
tory by Art Matney’s pitching and
Will Lowry’s well-placed hitting.

After leading off with a single,
Lowry scored the first run, and then
in the eighth connected with a two-
run triple to close out the Tigers’
scoring.

hits

as

Hampden-Sydney also scored
two runs in the fourth on three
consecutive singles followed by
a sacrifice fiy and another single
by Garnet Davis.

Matney drove in the other run on
a single in the eighth.

Brice Gamber started on the
mound for the Generals, but was re-
lieved by Louis Paterno in the
eighth. This was the longest period
that Gamber had played in a game
this season. Coach Lyles said that
this would be good experience for
Gamber, who although he has been
pitching a little wild this season,
will be an excellent prospect for
next year.

In general, Lyles said that the
team play “wasn’t bad” and empha-
sized that the score was 4-2 until

 

 

the eighth when the Tigers got two

hits off Paterno.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Debate Team
Defeats W-F

The Washington and Lee debate
team capped off a highly successful
season by capturing the Television
Debate Championship of North Car-
olina from Wake Forest last night.

The three-man W&L team of Al
Eckes, Bill Noell and Bill Boardman
won their third straight match with
a unanimous decision victory over
the Deacons.

W&L was the only school to
emerge undefeated from the meets
which were held during the past
three months.

In addition to this television cham-
pionship, the team also won the
Virginia State Championship earlier
in the year. Included in their other
activities this year have been 14
tournaments, six television shows, a
discussion conference and_ several
demonstrations debates.

 

Executive Committee Has
Light Business Session

In a short business meeting last
night, the Executive Committee fin-
alized plans to meet freshmen in
the dorm next week to discuss the
Honor System.

EC members will hold meetings
throughout the dorm at 10 p.m. next
Tuesday.

Their aim is to clarify any mis-
conceptions or misgivings about the
system that may have arisen re-
cently in the freshman class.

Arrangements were also made last
night for an informal solicitation of
votes among seniors to secure pas-
sage of the EC’s recently proposed
constitution. As a result of last
week’s election only slightly more
than 30 votes are needed to push
the measure through.

Votes will be solicited informally
at the Senior _banquet tonight.

Stickmen Lose Last Game

Duke’s Buckalaw threw in the final
goal of the day to cinch the win.

Good individual play by Duke’s
midfielder Griffith, who accounted
for three Duke goals, and tight de-
fensive work by Mike Welsh, saved
the day for the Blue Devils.

Virginia

The Generals’ final game of the
season this Saturday against the
University of Virginia is expected to
be a tough one. The Wahoos are
rated among the top ten teams in the
nation and have beaten the same
Baltimore U. team which the Gen-
erals lost to last week, 19-6.

President Cole commended the Re-

what he called “the necessity of en-
couraging future research and teach-
ing through superior instruction and
close scholar-student relationship at
the undergraduate level.”

Dr. Robert D. Whitaker, 29-year-

out yet according to President
Cole, but he emphasized that “Mr.
Latture’s long years of service are
invaluable and we are very pleased
he has expressed a desire to help
in these areas of interest to him
and importance to the University.”

Besides his fine record at W&L,
Mr. Latture has another monument
to a very successful career,. He was,
as I am sure we are all aware, one
of the founders of Omicron Delta
Kappa, the leadership fraternity
with chapters on over 100 campuses.
If there were no other mark—which

Gilmore Hits Rush Plan

(Continued from page 2)

(2) It will not be the end of fac-
ulty attack on fraternities even if the
faculty now accepts it.

It will keep the student body in
a continual “RUSH WEEK” for 4-5
weeks instead of one, and the fresh-
men will not know appreciably more
about all fraternities in 4-5 weeks
than in one.

It will probably mean fewer fresh-
men will ever join a fraternity, and
it will probably mean that the
5 or 6 best fraternities will come
out best and the rest of your 12-13
houses will gradually weaken.

The faculty, in a few years, will
say that too much interference in
classes has resulted from this ex-
tended “RUSH WEEK,” and sopho-
more year rushing-pledging-initia-
will be a 100% certainty.

Our established rush week coming
before school opens is the BEST for
W&L. DO NOT LET FACULTY
PRESSURE CONVINCE YOU
OTHERWISE! Any change now will
be a mistake for the fraternity or-
ganization in general and for 12-13
houses specifically.

intellectual apathy. I mean, all peo-

Mind you, I’m not condemning the

100—10% of the student body! And

I bet that hot playwright, uh,

TC: Tower?

FR: Yeah, Tower. I bet he’s not

getting his message across to the
bunch of lunk-heads around here.

TC: Did you see the plays?

FR: No, I don’t go in for that
avant-garde stuff at all, I’ve never
seen any of that junk. It’s for the
birds. And Ill tell you why I think
so, too. My Father, he’s from Alaba
ma, he says...

TC: Never mind, let’s get back to
all you freshmen leaving school.
What do you like about W&L?

FR: Oh, most everything, I guess.
I mean, like I tell the guys back
home. This is really a great place
when you get right down to it.

 

TC: Oh, well, then how many of
you guys are leaving? I understand
the rumor’s about thirty.

FR: Oh, at least. Probably more.
I know one guy for sure. He’s in
my dorm section. I don’t know his
name, but know for sure he’s leav-
ing. And I'll bet there are a lot
more too.

TC: Yes, I imagine so. They’re, I
mean, you're all leaving for a “san-
er, more mature world,” is that it?

FR: Yeah, that’s it. “Saner, more
mature world,” that’s the words
I've been looking for. I mean, has a
nice ring, doesn’t it? Sort of like a
slogan. Yeah, that’s what we’re going
to do all right. We’re going to get
out of here and start thinking. Like
getting out of high school again.
Into a different millennium.

TC: Milieu?

FR: Oh yeah, milieu. What are you
going to do?

When asked the reason for the
baseball team’s losing season, Coach
Lyles gave three main weak points;
too many errors, weak catching and
the lack of hits when they were
needed.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

This is the final column of my eighth year of writing for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and this year, as in every pre-
ceding year, when I come to the last column of the season, I

come to a problem.

My contract with the makers of Marlboro calls for me to
write a humor column and, truly, I do the best I can—all things
considered, I am not, I should explain, a jolly man by nature.

Why should T be?

First of all, I am shorter than everybody.
Second, there are moths in my

‘ashmere jacket. Third, I work

All the same, when it comes time to write this column, I light
a good Marlboro Cigarette, put aside my trauma, and try with
all the strength in my tiny body to make some jokes. Some-
times it works better than others, but on the last column of the
year, it just flatly doesn’t work at all.

Even in the very beginning this was true—and that, you will re-
call, was eight years ago when I was relatively young and strong
and had not yet developed that nasty knock in my transmission.
Well do I remember sitting down to write the final column of my

first year.

Day followed barren day, and not a yoek, not a boff,

not a zinger did I produce. I was about to give up humor and
take a job selling mechanical dogs when all of a sudden, in a

blinding flash,

I realized why I couldn’t think of any jokes!

I leapt up from my typewriter and ran as fast as my little
fat legs would carry me to the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
and I tugged my forelock, and I said, “Sirs, I am well aware
that you have engaged me to write a humor column, but today,
as I approach the final column of the season, I am far too misty
to be funny, for the final column of the season is, after all, a
leave-taking, and when I think of saying goodbye to my audience
—the swellest audience any columnist ever had—the college
students of America—wonderful human beings, every man and

when, sirs, I think of saying good-

levity, and so I ask you, sirs, to let me, in the final column of the

year,

Then I took out my bandanna, wiped my eyes, ears, nose, and

throat and waited for a reply

from the makers of Marlboro.

They sat around the polished board room table, the makers,

Stay happy. Stay loose,
