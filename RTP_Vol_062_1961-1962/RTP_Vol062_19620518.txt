IFC Undergoes Changes, Acquires Power

By ROGER PAINE
Friday Managing Editor

The election of Ross Kyger as
next year’s president of the Inter-
fraternity Council marks one of the
steps that have been made in the
past year by the IFC to prove that
it is a maturing student organiza-
tion. Kyger’s election came despite
the fact that the University Party
candidate is usually elected year
after year by the 10-8 majority that
the Big Clique holds.

It is obvious that fraternities are
thinking more about the responsi-
bility that the IFC should have, once
did have, and will have once again if
if it can show itself worthy of pos-
sessing that responsibility. At one
time the IFC held complete control
over student social affairs. The fac-
ulty kept out of everything, hoping
that the students on the IFC would
meet all the needs that arose.

 

Since that year’s IFC did not use
its power, and because this trend was
continued in following years, the
faculty removed all power from the
IFC and took most of the control of
student social affairs into its own
hands. The result was the banish-
ment of combos on Sunday, the re-
stricting of the hours of combos to
2 am., and the demand that girls be
out of fraternity houses at 3 a.m.

This year the IFC is once again
trying to assert itself. The task at
hand is to regain the contidence of
the faculty, and then maintain the
IFC as a mature and responsible
student organization. The IFC hopes
to show positive action, and not
merely reaction, in all future moves.

One of the big problem areas for
the IFC is communication with the
faculty. Students must work through
the Faculty Committee on Fraterni-
ties in all things they do in order
to make any impression on the facul-

NEWS BRIEFS

 

Student Control Committee
Will Be Enlarged Next Year

A plan for increasing the size of the Student Control Committee will be
submitted to the administration Monday. The Executive Committee is
asking for two additional members, who will be chosen at large.

This plan has been devised in favor of an alternate increase of one
representative from the junior class and another at large. President-elect
Tim Ireland hinted that the Student Control Committee may become
even more powerful next year.

 

WEL Receives $30,000 Grant

A grant of $30,000 to W&L from the Research Corporation of New York
was announced Tuesday by President Cole. The grant will be used to
strengthen the science program through the addition of professors, Presi-
dent Cole said.

The sum will be expended at the rate of $15,000 annually over a two-
year period, President Cole added.

Science Departments Attend Convention in Norfolk

Thirteen students and six faculty members represented Washington and
Lee at a meeting of the Virginia Academy of Science in Norfolk May 9-12.

Attending from the department of psychology were Donald Stubbs,
Wally Thulin, Clarence Whitehead, John Harcourt, Milford Schwartz, Dr.
William Hinton, and Dr. Leonard Jarrard.

From the chemistry department were Robert Auburn, Edward Eadie,
George Fozzard, John Ambrose, C. W. Hickam, Kerford Merchant, Henry
Hawthorne, Bruce Houghton, Dr. John Wise, Dr. Robert Whitaker and
Dr. Keith Shillington.

Dr. Edward Turner represented the physics department.

 

Debate Team Elects Officers For Next Year

Al Eckes and Jay Clark were elected co-captains of the debate team
for next year in a meeting last night. Ed Norton was elected manager, and
Steve Smith publicity chairman. Bill Boardman is the retiring captain.

 

Course To Be Built Around New Computer

A non-credit one-hour course in computer programming and machine
operation will be offered next semester by Baine Fox, director of the office
of statistical records. The course will involve one afternoon class section
per week.

Fox said a maximum of three sections can be handled, with a maximum
of 15 students per section. No prerequisite is required for the course, and it
is open to all students on a first come basis.

Crenshaw Elected President Of Revived AAUP

The Washington and Lee chapter of the American Association of
University Professors, disbanded during the 1930's, was reactivated last
night and Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw was elected president of the chapter.

A constitution was adopted and other officers chosen as follows: vice
president, Dr. Milton Colvin; secretary-treasurer, Dr. James Patty. The
AAUP has a membership of 47,000 professors and has chapters on 670
campuses. Founded in 1915, its primary function has been to defend the
principle of academic freedom.

Also on the committee are Mr. Mat-

The IFC has gotien sick, however
of hearing third-hand what the fac-
culty thinks ought to be done and,
conversely, the faculty is often un-
aware of what the IFC is planning
and trying to accomplish. President-
elect Kyger has said that a greatly
increased amount of direct contact.
between the faculty committee and
the IFC will be brought into effect
in the coming year.

Many notable accomplishments can
be attributed to the IFC this year.
Freshest in everyone’s mind is the
Hell Week abolishment, which was
passed 12-6 by the IFC. This move
will be strictly enforced next year,
beyond the penalty of a mere fine.
According to Kyger, the IFC will

put teeth into all the resolutions
which it passes.

Several fraternities are bitterly
opposed to the Hell Week change,
but most houses accept the change
as inevitable and as ultimately best
for the school. It is felt that effec-
tive pledge-training programs can
be planned throughout the semester
so that the need that has been felt
in the past for a Hell Week will no
longer be present.

The IFC also has worked dili-
gently all year long on the Rush
Week proposal, which failed to win
the necessary two-thirds majority
by one vote that would have passed
it and made it a part of the W&L
life. The plan will be modified and
presented to the IFC again next
year. It is felt that the plan was
voted down by some fraternities be-
cause it has not yet been perfected.
Several members of the faculty are
greatly in favor of this plan and

“Dorn’s very versatile, and tries
to adopt his music to please his au-

president of the Dance Board.

Dorn’s orchestra features smart-
ly arranged music and is capable of
playing just about everything from
society music to hot Latin-American
cha-chas.

His band has played a wide range

to high school proms, to hviel en-

think it is the best possible thing
for W&L.

One of the IFC’s pet peeves this
year has ben the constant accusa-
tion that its moves are made only
because unles it does act, the facul-
ty will cram something down the
students’ throats. This has been an
often said statement in regard to
the Rush proposal. The fact is that
the IFC was asked by the faculty to
study our rush system and those of
other schools and decide if there
might be a better one for this school.
The faculty would have been willing
to continue with the system as it
stands if the IFC had decided that
our present way of doing things
truly is the best.

The committee on the IFC which
was chosen to study this problem de-
cided, quite honestly, that a change
was needed, and the system they
have proposed has won the praise
and support of the administration

 

and much of the faculty. There was,
however, no ultimatum delivered by
the faculty stating that a change be
made or else.

The IFC is trying to come up with
original ideas for improvements at
W&L before the faculty feels it is
necessary to step in and apply pres-
sure for such improvements. One
idea that is in the pot at the present
time is to cut down fraternity ex-
penses in all fields as much as pos-
sible. A concrete suggestion is that
all fraternities cooperate next Rush
Week and purchase only keg beer.
This would save hundreds of dollars
all told, and would certainly be a
step in the direction of economizing
on fraternity outlay.

There has also been talk of plac-
ing a ceiling on the prices of com-
bos that are hired by fraternities
for dance weekends.

And so, the IFC is moving once

New Constitution

Publications Board Amendment Passes;

Both To Take Effect In Next Elections

Publications Board amendment have received the majority of
the student body votes necessary for passage student body
secretary Steve Suttle announced yesterday.

The elimination of the annual nominating convention in

 

Hairy Seeks
Serene Climes

The Finals Issue of The Southern
Collegian will be available near
the first of June. It will be “Mr.
Hairy’s” Goodbye Issue, due to the
fact that Hairy has had so many
rocks thrown at him this year by
so many people that he developed
a severe persecution complex and
has decided to withdraw from the
W&L student body. He hopes to
find a more serene and intellectual
atmosphere at the school to which he
has transferred—the University of
North Carolina.

At any rate, Hairy promises not to
leave W&L without a bang. There
will be the usual girls and the usual
jokes and the usual cartoons. In
fact, the issue might be fairly usual.
The staff has massed its forces this
issue, however, for a little satire di-
rected at some of the learning pro-
cesses of the school (all of this done
in perfectly good taste, of course)
and the 1962 All-Star Party Team
will be announced.

In the Finals Issue there will also
be a certain amount of honking of
the horn of self as the staff proudly
presents itself. A picture story by
Photographer Editor Dennis Brack
will be run which is entitled “Sun-
day.” There will also be a number
of ribald classics mixed with the
ads and all the rest of the usual
tripe.

Ask any VMI Cadet what May
14, 1864 means to him and he’ll tell
you that it was on that day 241
cadets won fame and honor for the
Institute on the Battlefields of New
Market.

Naturally, this is one of the Instit-
tute’s most cherished traditions, and
to six cadets there today it is even
more cherished. These six are des-
cendents of New Market Cadets.

Brifly, the story behind the New
Market campaign is: The nothern
forces under General Stegel were
moving down the Valley meeting
little opposition they marched.
The Southern forces were weakened
and in need of reserves but regard-
less of their condition they had to
meet and halt Stegel’s army. It was
at this point some Confederate of-
ficial struck upon the idea of using
the VMI cadets to back the Southern
forces up.

A message was sent to Colonel
Scott Shipp—the Institute’s 24-year-
old Commandant—and he set out
with the majority of the corps for
the three day march to New Market.

as

 

 

favor of a petition-nomination plan
and the elimination of three of the
four dance presidents are the two
major changes in the constitution.
The Publications Board amendment
provides for the replacement of the
Publications Board’s member on the
EC by a second junior class rep-
resentative.

Une. the new constitution tne
nominating convention has _ been
abolished. Instead, any student pre-
senting a petition with 150 or more
signatures and a statement of the
office for which he is running will
be placed on the ballot.

Within a week after the deadline
for qualification there will be a vol-
iuntary student body assembly at
which the candidates for the otiices
of president, vice president and sec-
retary of the student body will
have a chance to present their views.
These changes will go into effect
in next year’s elections.

The second major change from
the old constitution is the elimination
of the offices of presidents of Springs,
Openings, and Finals. Their duties
will be assumed by the three class

presidents. The sophomore class
president will be in charge of
Springs, the junior president in

charge of Openings, and the senior
president in charge of Finals.

The other class officers wilt assisi
their respective presidents in the
dance preparations as well as any-
one else that he might appoint.

The only other changes are re-
wording and rearrangement of sev-
eral sections and the deletement of
the article pertaining to the selec-
tion of cheerleaders.

VMI Cadets Observe New Market Battle Anniversary

It was the ecadet’s spirit and en-
thusiasm that won the victory at
New Market. Late in the afternoon
of the battle the Southern forces
found themselves pinned down by
the Union guns. They could neither
advance nor retreat. It was at this
point that the Cadets came up out
of their trenches and began to
charge. A charge that caught the
northern forces off guard—both be-
cause of its suddeness and because
of the age of the people effecting
it (the average age of the cadets
was 18) and encouraged the South-
ern troops of General Breckenridge
to follow the charge.

Ten cadets were lost in the bat-
tle—six of them have been re-
turned to the VMI Post where they
are buried today.

The celebration of this historical
event is an annual affair at VMI, and
is covered by newspapers all over
the nation. To our neighboring in-
stitution, New Market Day is as hal-
lowed a tradition as Founders’ Day
is on this campus.

An IFC Problem

As Roger Paine points out today in his page one article, the
IFC seems to have been hampered in the past year by inade-
quate ,communications with the faculty. Apparently, no one
really seems to know the specific nature of many of the faculty’s
complaints about the fraternity system. And, likewise, the IFC,
and the student body as a whole, has no consistent means by
which it can air its problems to the faculty. The result in the last
year seems to have been a rather reactionary all-or-nothing at-
titude by both sides, especially by fraternities.

We are sure that both the faculty and the IFC are sympa-
thetic to each other’s problems, and that, whenever possible,
each would like to find a workable compromise in a specific area
of dispute. But compromises are difficult to reach when
legislation is based on haphazard second-hand information.

This problem would perhaps be most effectively solved
if the more interested members of the faculty and the student
body would take it upon themselves to create an informal dis-
cussion group, one which would be designed to foster informed
conversation and off-the-record opinions. A group such as this,
unimpeded by an “official” capacity, could do much to promote
responsible and thoughtful student government at Washington

and Lee.

Our Apologies

The editors of the Friday Ring-tum Phi apologize for their
statement in last week’s paper that “25 freshmen left on their
on accord at the end of the first semester.” In the original copy,
the number was ‘‘5,” and the mistake was purely typographical.
For an unfortunate occurrence such as this, the editors accept

full responsibility.

The “freshman problem” has perhaps been exaggerated,
but we still maintain that the freshman year’s academic work
could be more interesting and more stimulating. Extension of
the advanced placement program which is to begin next
year in the history department will help. But the faculty pro-
gram of freshman counselling, as we pointed out last week, is
still woefully inadequate. And the dorm counselors are a poor
substitute for the upperclass friendships that were a part of
fraternity membership before the advent of the dining hall.

The assimilation of freshmen into the University, in the
broad sense of the word, is a very big and a very bad problem
at present. We are less worried about the minority who want
to leave than we are about the very real reasons that many of
our freshmen have to be dissatisfied with their first year at

We&L.

 

Sanity at UNC: ‘Hot Nuts’ |)

Dear Sir:

There has been much said in re- |‘

cent issues of the R-t P about the

supposed mass exodus of many of| ™

this year’s freshman class because
of a desire to (1) be in a more
urbane environment, (2) matriculate
in a more intellectual climate, (3)
escape the vices of a rigorous social
life. However, we the undersigned
of next year’s rising senior class
feel that W&L provides all the in-
tellectual stimulation necessary for
a sound liberal arts education; that
Lexington does, after all, offer ade-
quate recreational facilities in the
form of three pool halls, five pubs,
one bowling alley, two flicks, and
more than adequate taxi service;
and that the social life strikes a hap-
py medium.

Nevertheless we are transferring
to the University of North Carolina
next year so that once again we may
enter that “sane world” wherein
we may derive the benefits of hear-
ing that grand old man of the South,
Martin Luther King, and enjoy the
solemnity and aethetic quality of
the ballads and spirituals of the
“Hot Nuts.”

To the Editor:

It seems from the correspondence
and articles which have appeared in
The Ring-tum Phi recently that an
exodus to greener academic pastures
is developing, apparently led by the
Bearded Prophet who is fast be-
coming Lexington’s answer to Moses.
With the protests being registered
by withdrawing freshman Sam
Walker, it would seem that it is time
for a look at what W&L is supposed
to do.

Possibly Mr. Walker, Mr. Slater,
and the many freshmen have been
mistaken in their beliefs about what
college should accomplish. According
to Mr. Walker, “a college exists for
one purpose only—for the purpose of
educating its students.” Of course,
this is right as far as it goes. How-
ever, there are other things to col-
lege than sitting in classrooms or
the library, and they are those very
things which Walker is against—the

Students At Conference Discuss
U.S.-Latin American Diplomacy

By JIM STARKEY

On May 2 more than 140 students
from over 60 of the leading colleges
and universities in the East gathered
at Aannapolis, Maryland, to take
part in the second annual Naval
Academy Foreign Affairs Confer-
ence.

Here, during this four-day con-
ference, the various aspects and
problems of United States foreign
policy in Latin America were exam-
ined in the light of the political,
social, and economic conditions of
Latin America.

The major purpose of the confer-
ence was to provide an opportunity
for a beneficial exchange of ideas on
the conference subject by “outstand-
ing college students, selected for
their interest in the field of interna-
tional relations.” After examining
the policies of the United States in
order to ascertain whether they were
consistent with the kind of Latin
America that is best for the world as
a whole, the conferees were to make
recommendations with regard to
what the policies of the United
States should be in Latin America.

Round-Table Groups

On the first day the conferences on
the basis of special interests, were
assigned to one of eight roun-table
discussion groups. Each group was
then cencerned with a specific area
in Latin America. The round tables
were moderated by prominent lead-
ers from the business, academic, and

 

political world, who were experts
in Latin American affairs.

Round-table Eight, of which I was
a member, concentrated primarily
on Brazil. Among the aspects of this
country discussed were: the poten-
tial of Brazil as a world power;
Soviet versus United States aims
in Brazil; Brazil’s attitude towards
the Organization of American States,
Pan-Americanism, the Latin Amer-
ican Common Market; and the value
and effect of U.S. military and eco-
nomic aid to Brazil.

After careful consideration of each
of these areas, the round table re-
solved that in view of the prob-
lems deriving from Brazil’s recent
emergence as a world power, and
out of our desire to foster the con-
tinuance of the domestic institutions
which have characterized the Bra-
zilian government since its inception,
the policy of the United States
should be based on the objectives
of developing a strong, independent,
economically sound Brazil, and fost-
ering amicable relations between the
United States and Brazil.

With respect to specific areas,
the group recommended that the
United States continue its economic
support of both governmental and
private sectors in an effort to accel-
erate the development of the Bra-
zilian economy.

Aid to Education

It was also proposed that the
United States, on the request of the
Brazilian government, should pro-
vide all possible assistance to the

development of the educational sys-
tem, and that the cultural exchange
program be expanded in both di-
rections in order to establish closer
cultural ties between the two peo-
ples.

In addition to the round-table dis-
cussions, five plenary sessions were
held during the course of the con-
ference, featuring speeches by major
public figures.

Among this group of distinguished
speakers were: the Honorable deLes-
seps S. Morrison, U.S. Ambassador
to the Organization of American
States, Senator John G. Tower, Re-
publican from Texas, the Honorable
Philip H. Coombs, Assistant Secre-
tary of the State for Cultural and
Educational Affairs, Rear Admiral
A. F. Schade, U.S. Navy Director of
the Politico-Military Division Of-
fice of the Chief of Naval Operations,
and Mr. Harry A. Jarvis, President
of Creole Petroleum Corporation of
Venezuela.

The conference closed on Satur-
day, May 5, with the discussion and
adoption of the resolutions formu-
lated by the eight round tables.
The conference, in my estimation,
was an overwhelming success, and I
consider having had the opportunity
of being a part of it, one of the most
valuable and rewarding experiences
of any college career.

(Editor’s note: Starky, along with
Ring-tum Phi Columnist Howard
Slater, represented Washington and
Lee at the foreign affairs confer-

 

ence held at the Naval Academy.)

ac

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee’s intercol-
legiate debate team has for the past
couple of years met with phenomen-
al success. In addition to participat-
ing in six television shows, 14 tour-
naments, and demonstrating before
civic and high school groups this
year alone, they have turned down
invitations to Miami, the Mardi
Gras, Hawaii and Harvard, among
others.

What’s behind this remarkable
record? According to Professor Wil-
liam Chaffin, head of the debate
team, the essence of good debate is
a “combination of research, presen-
tation and analysis.”

In the fall, Professor Chaffin holds
practice debates. Assisted by his top
team members, he criticises and
offers suggestions for improvements
to those who are participating.

Interest and Ability

The prime prerequisites for de-
bating here, according to Chaffin,
are interest and ability. He said that
“it is immaterial how little exper-
ience a person has had. Time, the
will to learn, and ability are the
chief factors involved. Anyone who
really has the desire and who puts
forth can debate at W&L.”

Pre-college training evidently is
is not so important. The first time
Chaffin took a winning team to the
state tournament, he took four
men—three freshmen and a sopho-
more. Bill Boardman, now one of the
top three debaters for the Generals,
had never seen an _ intercollegiate
debate, until, with only three weeks
experience, he won one.

There aren’t any sort of training
rules or hard-and-fast regulations
for the forensic champs. “We might

 

hold a practice debate at 19 am.,
2 p.m. or 10 p.m.”

Eckes, Noell, and Boardman

Twenty-odd students have par-
ticipated in debate this year, with
the top three being Al Eckes, Bill
Noell, and Bill Boardman. Chaffin
has made frequent use of Malcolm
Morris, Steve Smith, and Ed Nor-
ton as well.

However, “no single person has
taken part in even half of the de-
bate events this year,” Chaitin said.
“If I'm going to meet a weak var-
sity from another school, there’s no
point in taking Eckes or Noell.
Everyone who spends time on it
can get a chance to go to a tourna-
ment.”

Debate is the longest continuous
activity—athletic or otherwise—at
W&L. It starts in September and
goes through May. This year, there
have been 26 events so far, with
a program at VMI Scheduled soon.
“Of these events, we have won
more than we have lost,’ Chaffin
said. “But to try to arrive at a
numerical average is meaningless,
because of the fact that different
debaters are in competition all the
time. Most of our defeats have come
from novices who have never debat-
ed before. It doesn’t really matter,
though. Winning isn’t the purpose—
giving as many people as possible
experience in debate is.”

Tremendous Research Man

Commenting on his top men, Mr.
Chaffiin lauded Eckes as a “tremen-
dous research man.” Eckes and
Noell, both high school champion de-
baters, are the number one and two
debaters, depending on the circum-
stances. “While Noell has wen the
top awards, Eckes has won more
awards than have been won in re-

cent history of W&L debate,” Caf-
fln said.

‘Nothing More Pitiful’

Leaving the debate team itself,
he commented on the value of col-
lege speaking experience. “Anybody
is a fool if they don’t get some
speaking training in college. Noth-
ing is more pitiful than someone
who has something to say and can’t
say it.”

Debate requires as much or as
little time as you want to put into
it, Chaffin said, and noted several
persons who had participaied only
occasionally, due to other commit-
ments. “In adidtion to the 20-odd
that have participated on the de-
bate team, another 20 or so have
been involved this year in debate
discussions,” he added.

One of the side benefits seems
to be the travel experience. At
various times, the W&L debate
team has toured Gettysburgh, seen
the Philharmonic Orchestra perform,
taken in Broadway plays, and “tound
other means of amusement on
trips,” Chaffin said wryly.

He talked enthusiastically about
the value of speech training, the ac-
tivities of the debate team, and
spoke proudly of the accomplish-
ments of the debaters in recent
contests. We do have a high quality
forensic group here, and this re-
porter couldn’t help feeling this is
due in a large part to Professor
Chaffin. He’s a man who knows de-
bate and loves it, and he showed
this when he closed his remarks
with the comment: “The magic word
in debate is rapport. You must have
that rapport—that special feeling
between the debaters and the au-
dience.”

 

Dr. Hughes Studies ‘Man-Created World’

 

By BILL ATWELL

Next year Associate Professor of
History Thomas P. Hughes will be
on leave of absence from Washing-
ton and Lee. This leave of absence
will enable Dr. Hughes “to culti-
vate a new area of history—the his-
tory of technology and society.”

When asked what the history of
technology basically is, Dr. Hughes
replied “that the field is the study
of the man-created world and of man
as the creator. We know a great
deal concerning artists, politicians,
ets., but we actually don’t really
know what made a great inventor
such as Thomas Edison tick. We want
to find out.”

Historians and Scientists

As technological research has be-
come more and more important, Dr.
Hughes feels, as do a great many
others including British historian
C. B. Snow, that it is necessary for
the historian and scientist to get
closer together. Dr. Hughes believes
the scientist and engineer have defi-
nite creative traits, but says, “un-

fortunately a misapplication of these
traits can result in the terrible
growth of an institutior such as
Nazi Germany. If we car find out
where man goes astray, the world
will profit by this knowledge

Dr. Hughes has done a great deal
of work in this field already. From
1958 to 1959 he did research in
Munich on a Fulbright Faculty Re-
search Grant. In addition Washing-
ton and Lee has suppored summer
research by him with Glenn Grants.

To Compile Text

Dr. Hughes has been very active
in the organization of national meet-
ings in this field. He is one of the
founders and currently program
chairman of the Society for the His-
tory of Technology. This society has
a large membership of people from
many walks of life. Next year’s pres-
ident will be Mervin J. Kelly, for-
mer head of the Bell Research Lab-
oratories.

Dr. Hughes will be extremely busy
in the next year. This summer he
will complete a two volume text
on the History of Technology, of
which he is co-author with Professor
Robert S. Woodbury of the Massa-

chusetts Institute of Technology.
This text will be printed in the
spring by Prentice-Hall.

During the first semester next

year, Dr. Hughes will serve as visit-
ing associate Professor of History at
M.LT. He will be taking the place
of Professor Woodbury, who wil! be
studying abroad under a Guggen-
heim Grant.

 

New History Field: Technology

The second semester he will spend
as visiting Professor of History at
the University of Wisconsin. The
purpose of this stay will be to intro-
duce the history of technology to
the student body there.

Dr. Hughes is looking forward to
this experience because it will en-
able him to carry out research and
to teach, while actually having the
two combined. “I will take the stu-
dents’ questions to the library and
try to come up with some answers,”
he said. The students will also take
active part in some research.

Kell, Essex
Will Attend
NCAA Meet

Tomorrow W&L trackmen Skip
Essex and Robin Kell will compete
in the NCAA Eastern regional cham-
pionships in Petersburg, Va.

Skip Essex is W&L’s outstanding
quarter miler, holding this year’s
record in the quarter mile at a time
of 49.9 seconds, which was good
for second place in the Virginia
State meet in Lynchburg.

At the Davidson relays Essex an-
chored the sprint medley team to
establish a new meet record. Skip
plans to compete only in the half
mile Saturday.

Robin Kell, who holds the school
record in the hop, step, and jump
with a leap of 44 feet 5 inces, and
the year’s record in the high jump
}; with a six feet 1/4 inch jump, will
jj compete only in the high jump as
Kell’s favorite event, the hop, step,
and jump, is not offered.

At the state meet Kell tied for
first place in the high jump and took
second in the hop, step, and jump.

Jim Hickey this year is ineligible
for competition, since he has been
on the varsity team for four years,
and the NCAA allows only three
years of varsity competition for its
participants.

Individuals Perform Well

Despite Poor Team Records

By STEVE HIBBARD

Though certain Washington and
Lee teams cannot boast records like
that of the football squad, their sea-
sons haven’t gone without high
points of interest.

The baseball team which posted
a 2-13-1 record has received little
notice of its individual standouts.
Senior Robin Wood was the most
consistent hitter on the team with
a seanson’s average of .298. Fielding,
necessary to any ball club, and
Park Gilmore’s improvement in the

obligations demanded much of his
time, but he made it a point to work
with his team as much as possible.

The lacrosse team has had a sea-
son much like that of the baseball
team .It has a young squad with
half of its players freshmen; how-
ever, it is hard to pass over indi-
viduals such as Ray Miller, John
McDaniel, and Charley Gummey
without recognizing their efforts.
Miller, who played goal for the first
time this year, will probably end up
leading the country in saves with an
average of 25 a game. Gummey was

double play helped the Generals out
of some tight spots.

Pitching was a problem through-
out the season, but the work of
Phil Sharp was commendable. Also,
freshman Mace McGowin’s steady
improvement shows a definite strong
point in next year’s team.

The valuable asset of Captain Ned
Hobbs can’t be overlooked. His other

Coach Joe Lyles is cautiously hopeful about the 1962 soc-

competition again that it met this year.

The team posted a 3-8 record for the 1961 season, but was
plagued by injuries and drop-outs. Despite the 3-8 record, the

team did take third place in the Virginia State Tournament.

Track Has Best
Spring Season

This spring has been a long, hard
one for the Washington and Lee
athletic department.

With but one intercollegiate con-
test remaining, a varsity lacrosse
match with the powerful U.Va. team,
the combined record for baseball,
varsity and JV_ lacrosse, golf,
tennis, and track is 24-31-1.

The baseball team concluded the
season with a 2-13-1 record. The tie
resulted from an 8-8, fifteen inning
game with Bridgewater which was
called because of darkness.

The varsity lacrosse team carries
a record of one victory and ten
defeats as it prepares to face the
Virginia team. The lone win came at
the expense of the University of
North Carolina team. The JV la-
crosse team chalked up a successful
4-1 season record. Both the golf and

They are a necessary part of the life

had better take a closer look at

If they want a school like this, with
all the time of a student being spent

I agree with them—they had better
go elsewhere.
