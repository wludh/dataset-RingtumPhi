Republican Candidate For Governor

 

GOP’s Pearson Here Monday

Washington and Lee students will have two
opportunities to hear H. Clyde Pearson, the
Republican candidate for governor of Vir-

ginia, on Monday.
Mr. Pearson will address a

School on Monday.

Mr. Pearson has vigorously attacked the
dominant Democratic organization in Virginia

in his campaign this fall.

luncheon spon-
sored by the Young Republican Club at a
place and time that have not yet been decided
and will discuss the Virginia Election laws at
3 p.m. in the Moot Court room at the Law

In a recent speech in Roanoke, he said of
the controversial Virginia election laws that
“there is a great need in Virginia at this time
for a realistic, comprehensive ‘Pure Election
Law.’ In the past, only rich men or ones
backed by the financial resources of the domi-
nant organization have been able to succeed in
the primaries or general elections...

The two speeches are open to students,
faculty, and townspeople.

The time and place of the luncheon for

Mr. Pearson will be posted on the ODK board.

Parsons Names Six Highest
Scores in Quiz Bowl Tests
To Determine WXL Team

Six men were named today
by Quiz Bowl director Frank
Parsons as having made out-
standing scores in preliminary

testing held to pick the Wash-
ington and Lee College Bowl

team.

Four juniors, a sophomore, and a
senior comprise the group which at
present leads the pack in the race
for team positions. Mac Brownlee,
Jim Campbell, Bill Lowry, Harry
Meem, Tom Lybass, and Richard
Jones are the six.

Four men will make the trip to
represent W&L on network televi-
sion.

Parsons based his choice of the
top six men on 170 questions which
he has given to the candidates. The
first quizzes required written an-
swers, but the next tests will be
oral ones, simulating actual contest
conditions.

Testing will resume next Wednes-
day in Newcomb 8, at 7:30 p.m. A
large number of hopefuls is still run-
ning for team berths.

Student Literary Book
Will Be Published Two
Times This School Year

By JOHN KIRKLEY

The student literary maga-
zine, Probes, begun by Tony
Gray last year, was an over-
whelming success; the issue
contained contributions from
all four classes at W&L and

was completely sold out.

Ron Alenstein, a ZBT senior, will
edit the magazine this year. One of
his stories, “Half Sick of Shadows”
appeared in the first issue of Probes
and then won a Mahan award from
the English department.

The purpose of Probes according
to Alenstein: “I have always
thought that there should be a
publication for strictly student
creative writing and I intend for
Probes to fill that need.”

Alenstein plans to bring out two
issues of the magazine this year, one
at the conclusion of each academic
semester. He intends to leave the
price at fifty cents per copy. If stu-
dent support and enthusiasm war-
rant change, he will alter format,
pictures, and type of paper.

All members of the student body
at Washington and Lee are urged
to contribute any poems, short
stories or critical essays, as well as
original art work, to Alenstein at
Box $7, Lexington. December 1 has
been set as a tentative closing date
for acceptance of articles for in-
clusion in the first semester issue.

Alenstein wants to interview
students interested in becoming
the business manager of Probes.
The position is a paying one, In-
terested parties should call him
before October 21 at HO 3-5188.

 

Forensic Union

In UN Debate

By BILL GRAVES

“Should the United Nations
abolished?”

Addressing an audience of 18, Bill
Noell immediately qualified this rath-
er shocking proposal in arguing the
affirmative by suggesting improvement
in certain areas rather than total abol-
ishment. In a well organized but
somewhat general speech, Noell
touched on the Hungarian revolt,
Communist aggression in Laos, the
Cuban situation, and other well
known examples of U.N. failure. He
went on to cite possible future prob-
lems such as recognition of Red China
and the proposed three-man Serce-
tary General in which Russia would
have a seat, and, of course, a veto.
Has the U.N. become little more than.
an “international P.T.A.?”

On the negative side, Dick Kelley
maintained that the U.N. was not a
great international power and that its
real influence lay in the “subtle pres-
sures” that it could diplomatically ex-
ert. He called the U.N. a buffer be-
tween total war on the one hand and
organized limited war on the other.
Another advantage, he said, was that
Russia and consequently Communism
could be held up to world censure.

Following the initial speeches, there
was a question and discussion period
in which the audience was invited to
participate. A vote was taken before
and after the meeting. Before the
speeches, six voted for abolition; after
the debate there were ten votes for
abolition and seven against.

Student Body E. C.
To Petition Faculty

EC Discusses Cold [EC Seeks Student Disciplinary
Committee To Consider Offenses

The Executive Committee will petition the Faculty Admin-
istrative Committee soon to create a student committee to which
some cases of student misconduct will be referred.

The request grows out of a decision reached at the recent

 

Checks, Fraternity
Plans During Meet

At its meeting Monday
night, the Executive Commit-
tee approved a petition to send
to the faculty Administrative
Committee requesting the cre-

ation of a student committee
to handle some student disciplinary
cases. (See the lead story on this
page.)

In other action, the EC talked
over the work of the Cold Check
Committee with Ned Hobbs, the
chairman; approved a memorandum
from Joe Goldstein, chairman of the
Library Committee, concerning his
committee’s activities; and formed
a committee of two to work with
Interfraternity Council President
Bob Doengnes or proposed improve-
ments in the fraternity system.

EC Secretary Steve Suttle was
appointed to head a subcommittee
to consider all proposed constitu-
tional changes. Suttle must gather
all these proposals, holding hear-
ings if necessary, by October 31.

After the October 31 deadline,
Suttle will then present the pro-
posals to the full committee for
consideration.

Hobbs said that the Cold Check
Committee will meet bi-weekly this
year in an attmept “to improve our
relationship with the merchants of
Lexington by cutting down on the
number of bad checks presented and
by helping the merchants to collect
the checks.”

To Collect Checks

He has drafted a form letter to
the merchants concerning the com-
mittee’s work, and set up a system
by which committee members will
make regular calls at all stores fre-
quented by students to see if any
bad checks have been passed.

The Cold Check Committee will
levy heavier fines this year and
will send the names of all second-
time offenders to the EC.

The EC approved Goldstein’s pro-
posal for heavier library fines but
rejected a request by the Library
Committee chairman that excessive
noise be removed from the list of
library offenses.

The EC pointed out that, while it
was difficult to enforce the noise
rule, the Library Committee should
still take the responsibility for the
amount of noise in the library.

Book Thefts?

The EC further instructed Gold-
stein to look into the report that
there were some 60 books found in
fraternity houses this summer which
had not been checked out of the li-
library. If this proved that there
was deliberate unauthorized remov-
al of books going on, the EC plan-
ned to take appropriate measures.

Executive Committeemen Buck
Ogilvie and Bill Roberts were ap-
pointed to work closely with IFC
President Doenges and to offer him
any assistance or advice they could
in the IFC’s supervision of fraternity
affairs.

Geology Prof
Heads Project

This past summer, Dr. Spencer,
head of the geology department at
Washington and Lee, was in charge
of a research expedition to the
Rocky Mountains in Montana. Dr.
Spencer took with him three W&L
geology majors—Richbourgh MeWil-
liams, Rick Belser, and Allen Ker-
win, The work that they were doing
is the last phase of a long term re-
search project sponsored by the Na-
tional Science Foundation.

The group was headquartered in
Bowman, Montana for two months.
Their objective was to collect data
on the rocks in a fifty by twenty
mile area of rugged terrain. This
land is classified as a “primitive”
area by the government; no im-
provements, such as roads or houses,
may be built on it. Dr. Spencer said
that some mountains in this section
reach a height of 11,000 feet and that
there are many wild animals, such
as bears, wolves, moose, elk, and
deer in the area.

The data that was collected in the
field during the summer is now be-
ing analyzed. The purpose in the
summer expeditions is to prove the
past existence of a mountain range

| in this region, Evidence gathered so

far indicates that a range did exist
in this location approximately one
and a half billion years ago and

was completely eroded down. The
present day Rockies are only seven-
ty million years old.

Dr.. S. J. Kazok, another member |
of the geology department and new |
to Washington and Lee, spent the

(Continued on page 4)

kleaders decided that they would try
to set up some system by which
misconduct by students from other
schools which took place on their
campuses would be referred to a
student committee at the offending
student’s school.

The student government leaders
felt this would be a good first step
toward giving their respective stu-
dent bodies a larger role in the ad-
ministration of student conduct.

In the petition that the EC will
present to the Committee, they point
out “the student body is not now
ready or willing to assume total re-
sponsibility in this area.”

However ,student body president
Andrew McThenia said “we feel that
creation of this committee will be
a valuable first step in developing
a sense of responsibility in the stu-
dent body.”

“This memorandum,” the EC says,
“is no sense a criticism of the pres-
ent faculty administrative commit-
tee. It is believed that this body
has been eminently fair in the de-
termination of all cases before it.

“However, many students who ap-
pear before the Administrative Com-
mittee do so only after a series of in-
cidents have occurred. The impact
of these offenses when compounded
is serious. If such incidents were
dealt with as they occurred perhaps
further incidents could be avoided.”

“A responsible student group
working with faculty guidance and
supervision could exert a_ strong
influence on the other students in
this area. The group could advise
a student guilty of misconduct that
such actions were unacceptable to
his own student generation.

“If it was the opinion of the group
that the case was sufficiently serious
to merit disciplinary action, then it
would be referred to the Faculty
Administrative Committee.”

The proposed student disciplinary
committee would consist o fthe pres-
idents of each academic and law
class, a representative elected from
the freshman class, and one member
of the administration.

The EC stated that discipline “is
not a proper area for its jurisdiction.
Because of the cherished authority
which the EC exercises in the en-
forcement of the Honor System, we
feel that additional authority in the
realm of misconduct would tend to
confuse the functions of the Com-
mittee.”

The petition which the EC will
present to the Administrative Com-
mittee was prepared by McThenia
and Executive Committeemen Meade
Christian and Tim Ireland. The whole
EC approved their memorandum
with only slight changes.

Student Discipline Committee

The Executive Committee took this week what we hope
will be the first step toward placing a larger measure of respon-
sibility for student discipline in the hands of students them-
selves. The EC is requesting that the faculty administrative
committee refer all reports of student misconduct which are
sent here from schools in this area to a committee consisting
of the seven class presidents and one faculty member.

This is a modest first step, to be sure. But it should show
whether student-administration discipline will work or not.

Most of the student body agrees that punishment should
be sternly administered for flagrant offenses such as destruc-
tion of property. However, there are some social rules here
with which a majority of the student body disagree. It would
prove a touchy situation if such rules had to be administered by
a student committee. The proposed disciplinary committee will
help show up areas where student standards of conduct differ
greatly with those of the faculty.

There is a great deal of student misconduct and irresponsi-
bility which now goes unreproved and unpunished. One of
the main reasons these offenses are never brought to light is
the feeling on the part of those who are in a position to report
them that the discipline as administered by the faculty com-
mittee in the past few years has been inconsistent and, often,
overly harsh. If there were some “lower court” with a more
benevolent reputation, many of these relatively minor offenses
could be prevented by making clear to everyone who goes
astray the whys and wherefores of the rules.

Nothing poisons the relationship between student body and
administration faster than an attempt on the part of the ad-
ministration to enforce rules which will inevitably be broken.
If any administration ever does this, evasion on the part of the
students tends to spread to the whole system of conduct they
are expected to follow.

If some sort of student disciplinary committee were set up,
it could probably prevent this sort of mutual disregard from
cropping up. In short, the lines of communication between
students and administration must be kept open.

We sincerely hope the faculty will approve the EC’s re-
quest for this disciplinary committee.

Virginia’s Mock Election

You may not know it, but there is a campaign going
on for governor of Virginia. Not much of a one, though.

The campaign comes to Lexington Monday in the person of
H. Clyde Pearson, the Republican candidate for governor. If
you are devoted to the seventh page of the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, you may have heard of Mr. Pearson. Otherwise, you
probably haven’t. Mr. Pearson is treated by the Virginia news-
papers with slightly less interest than they accord the Mock
Convention.

But every voter in the November election—and there won’t
be many of them—will have to choose between Mr. Pearson
and Albertis Harrison, the Democratic candidate.

Mr. Harrison, who will almost certainly prove to be an
outstanding governor, won the primary over A. E. S. Stephens
by posting large advertisements in every newspaper in Virginia

pointing out that Mr. Stevens had been endorsed by the
NAACP and the AFL-CIO.

So much for Virginia politics. We’re interested in what Mr.
Pearson would like to do about the situation. We haven’t been
able to find out, but we’ll try Monday.

Praise For ‘Probes’

We are glad to hear that Probes will appear again this year.
We hope that editor Ron Alenstein will find enough students
with the urge to write to justify two issues a year.

It is well that Probes is being tried out now in its present
modest format. But if it proves as successful and well-done a
venture as it was last year, it will certainly deserve the same sup-
port given all student publications—by being made a part of
the student activities fee.

Meanwhile we wish Mr.

Probes.

Crime and Punishment In Lexington

By STEVE HENRY
(This column is dedicated to
those unfortunate souls in the stu-
dent body who have felt the wrath
of the ancient and honorable Lex-
ington Police Department.)

If you, dear reader, think for one
small second that the Lexington po-
lice department spends its time do-
ing nothing more important than
giving tickets, helping little kiddies
across the street, and playing tough
guy during student riots, then you
are irretrievably wrong.

Let us take this opportunity to
set you straight.

In reality, the Lexington constabu-
lary is an alert, high-minded, ex-
ceptionally intelligent group of po-
lice officers, dedicated to keeping the
peace and protecting the common
rights of every citizen of this fine
community.

Do not gasp in amazement. Before
this column is over you will see
what profound truth the above state-
ment holds.

Take, for example, the masterful
way that the nifty little LPD han-
dled the Carlos Marcello incident in
1959.

Marcello, as everyone knows, is
one of that rapidly dying, truly
American breed — the hoodlum
gangster. Or so Bobby Kennedy and
the U.S. Senate would like to have
you think.

Cool Carlos, for lack of anything
better to call him, is a big-time
racketeer—a man who never over-
looks an opportunity for making an
honest dollar.

In September, 1959, Marcello and
three of his underworld cronies
rolled down Route 11 into the heart
of Lexington, a sinster plot in mind.

What he had planned was a series
of sweeping changes in the local
government of the small hamlet,
which would eventually enable him
to turn Lexington into the “sin city
of the Shenandoah Valley.”

In Marcello’s mind, there was no
doubt that his plan would work to
perfection.

He would, in rapid order, accom-
plish the following revisions:

1. Take over the local government,
opening the doors to graft and cor-
ruption.

 

2. Take over the pinball machine
racket.

3. Take over the text-book selling
racket.

4. Open a string of plush night
clubs.

5. Open a string of houses of ill-
repute.

6. Sell protection to the local
bourgeoise merchants.

In short, Carlos was a cinch for
man-of-the-year- honors in Lexing-
ton.

Alas, poor Carlos. He did not
figure on the Lexington Police De-
partment. He underestimated the in-
tegrity, the drive, the fierce de-
votion of this organization, just as
others had done before him.

Marcello had planned to buy off
the local law enforcement, just as he
had successfully done in New Or-
leans.

On September 13, he approached
the Mayor of Lexington, while the
good man was on duty, throwing
cards at a hat in the middle of his
spacious office.

“Mayor,” said Carlos. “I have a
great plan for you and me. It’ll net
you a cool million.”

“What do I need a million dol-
lars for?” answered the Mayor. “I
live in Lexington.”

Astounded by this reply, Marcello
laid his plan on the line, hoping to
sway the morals of this servant of
the people.

‘Tll even replace those horrid
brown police uniforms,” said Carlos.

“That, sir, is an insult. Leave this
room at once,” yelled the Mayor.

Carlos was naturally crushed. He
could not believe that any human
would turn down a million dollars
for nothing.

He was soon to be even more dis-
illusioned.

For it was at this crucial point that
Elmer Fudd and his Unbearables
stepped into the scene.

The Unbearables, composed of all
the members of the Lexington Po-
lice Department, had often encount-
ered big time crime, and knew how
to handle smart operators like Mar-
cello.

There had even been talk of mak-
ing a television series about the
group, but producers decided that
there was already too much situa-
tion comedy television.

 

With a series of lightning fast,
brilliantly calculated strokes, the
Unbearables moved to stop Marcello
and his mob.

On September 13, Marcello was
given a ticket for parking in front
of the College Inn. He was to appear
in court on the third of October,
at nine in the morning.

On September 14, he was ticketed
for doing 31 miles per hour in a
30 mph zone.

On September 15, he was ticketed
for making 41 mph in a 40 mph
zone,

On September 16, he was ticketed
for running a red light.

On September 17, he was ticketed
for going north on a south-running
one-way street.

On September 18, Carlos stayed
in his room, too scared to make an
appearance on the streets.

When he finally came down from
his luxurious suite in the Robert E.
Lee, he found a ticket on his car
for parking too far from the curb.
(He was six inches from the curb
instead of the prescribed two inches.)

It was all too much for Carlos.
He hopped in his car, roared off, and
two seconds later was run off the
road by a squad car driven by
Elmer and two of his sneering ma-
chine-gun wielding Unbearables.

“We got you now, Marcello,”
snarled Fudd.

“For what?” asked the somewhat
frustrated Carlos.

“For speeding in a quiet zone,”
laughed Fudd. “That’s a jailable of-
fense around here.”

Marcello could hardly believe that
he was being taken to jail. He had
avoided being jailed in New Orleans,
in Memphis, in New York. And sud-
denly he was being thrown in the
clink of Lexington, Virginia.

From behind bars in the awe-
inspiring edifice known as the Lex-
ington Penitentiary, Carlos called his
slick, big-town lawyer, Sneaky Ra-
gen.

“Come down and spring me,”
shouted Carlos, his temper flaring.

“Where are you, Carlos, old boy,”
queried Sneaky.

“In Lexington, Virginia, charged
with speeding in a quiet zone,” an-
swered Carlos.

“Forget it, Carlos,” said Sneaky.
“No one has beat a rap in Lexing-

 

ton for 150 years. You’re through.”

Carlos found out how right Sneaky
was when his trial took place on
October 3.

His case came up immediately
after the honorable city judge had
disposed of the usual docket, in-
volving 800 Washington and Lee
students.

Carlos watched in awe as all 800
were found guilty as charged and
fined unbelievable sums.

He was trembling for the first time
in his life when he approached the
bench, where sat the good judge.

“Guilty,” said the judge, without
asking for any evidence or state-
ment of the facts in the case. “You
are hereby sentenced to a $500,000
fine for speeding in a quiet zone, or
you are sentenced to living the rest
of your life in Lexington. Take your
choice.”

Marcello, who had based his life
on the Fifth Amendment, was stupi-
fied. At first, he thought that he
should demand a trial, but he knew
that it would be a useless gesture.

“T’ll take the fine,” said, visual-
izing the nightmare of living in Lex-
ington for the rest of his life.

“Make out the check to the town-
ship of Lexington,” smiled the judge,
figuring out on his desk what ten
per cent of $500,000 was.

On the sidelines, Elmer and the
brown-shirted Unbearables smiled,
too, pride and intellect oozing from
every pore.

That night, Carlos and his gang
pulled up stakes in Lexington, their
plans shattered to bits. The “sin
city of the Shenandoah Valley”
would never be a reality.

“Crummy two-bit cops,” snarled
Marcello as he drove away, leaving
forever the township of Lexington.

It was the first time in his life
that he had ever overestimated the
Lexington Police, and by that time,
it was too late.

Friday Historical Staff Recalls Campus Commie Purge

(This article is being run in co-
operation with the Conservative
Society to alert students to the
dangers of Communist infiltration.)

Few students remember the time
when the Communists almost took
over Washington and Lee. But the
story deserves to be retold to a stu-
dent generation blind to the dangers
of international Communism.

Few people realize that there was
a Communist cell on the campus
here in 1902. There was, however.
A determined little cell of reds here

 

in that year, under the leadership
of Fedor Quitepinsky, who had been
exiled from Brownsburg by the
Un-American Activities Committee
of the Brownsburg PTA because of
Communist agitation there. He had
never agitated at Brownsburg but
took the Fifth when called before
the PTA committee to justify his
attempt in 1900 to change the school
uniforms of Parry McClure high
school from blue to red.

What Quitepinksky planned to do
here, according to his memoirs, My

Nat’! Science Grant Experiments
By Randall Jones

During the past summer, members of the Washington and
Lee chemistry department continued work on various science
grant experiments and participated in several National Science
Foundation summer lecture programs.

Dr. E. S. Gilreath was in charge of the Inorganic Chemistry

program at Oregon State University*
in Carvallis, Oregon. Dr. Gilreath
delivered an extensive series of lec-
tures to a group of 47 college chem-
istry teachers from all sections of
the country.

Attending Louisiana State Univer-
sity in Baton Rouge, Dr. John H.
Wise participated in the National
Science Foundation program, giv-
ing special attention to isotope ex-
perimentation.

Also participating in the N.SF.
program was Dr. Wm. J. Watt who
conducted a seminar for high school
teachers at the Alabama College in
Montevallo, Ala. Continuing work
on a previously begun experiment,
Dr. James K. Shillington plans to
proceed with students George Foz-
zard and Henry Hawthorne.

Remaining on campus for experi-
men tation through a grant from
the Research Corporation of New
York was Dr. Robert D. Whitaker
and a 1961 graduate, John Ambrose.
For the past two years, the team has
been studying the chemical reac-
tions of certain inter-haloger com-
pounds and amines, nitrogen com-
pounds. The first summer was spent
in the preparation and study of the
new compounds thus allowing this
summer’s work to be more special-
ized.

 

 

The constituent inter-halogen
compounds are ICI and ICI3, the
latter of which little was known.
When the aforementioned were com-
bined with amines, the resultants
were in ratio of 1 to 1 molecular
addition. In a simplified explanation,
molecular addition occurs when two
neutral compounds are combined,
thus adding to the characteristics of
each without changing the original
compounds.

The past summer’s work enabled
Dr. Whitaker and Ambrose to
successfully combine two units of
ICI3 with two amines, a task never
before completed. Presently the
value of this experiment is purely
academic, but the structure, com-
position and general properties of
these compounds have been clearly
elucidated.

Further work on this project will
be undertaken by Jeff Lasher, a
Robert E. Lee science grant reci-
pient. Lasher plans to use the
Hetrodyne Beat apparatus, built last
year by senior Tom Imerson in con-
junction with Dr. E. F. Turner. The
apparatus will accurately determine
the charge separation in compounds.

ICI and ICI3, will be first tested
to determine their charge separation
while later experiments will include
inter-halogen, amine compounds.

 

Campaign to Free the Workers and
Peasants of Rockbridge County
(Bucharest, 1934), was to turn the
Campus Club into a Communist
front. He had chosen the Campus
Club because they edited a dissident
publication called Gripe.

First Quitepinksky enrolled in
W&L as a day student. He then re-
fused to pay his $3.50 rush fee and
was accordingly not bid by any fra-
ternities. The Campus Club rushed to
his defense and offered him a mem-
bership. Quitepinksky accepted just
as he had planned and offered to
contribute to Gripe.

In a_ short time Quitepinksky
was pouring out the Marxist line un-
der the pen name of Ascott III.
Under this mask of anonymity he
was immune from criticism or ex-
posure.

He attacked the $10 application
fee for admission as an imperialist
plot, designed to discourage workers
and peasants from applying to W&L.

He spoke out against the petty
bourgeoisie of the Ring-tum Phi
staff, all of them working under
intolerable conditions in the hope
of one day being able to gain the
massive sum of $200 paid the edi-
tors. He uncovered the fact that
they had no chance whatsoever
since the editorship was firmly con-
trolled by a small elite of capital-
ists.

He argued that the student body
constitution’s guarantees of civil

 

 

liberties were meaningless as long
as the vast proletariat was domi-
nated by a few secret aristocratic
organizations.

Soon Quitepinksky’s articles be-
gan to attract readers to Gripe. He
moved into the next phase of his
plan.

He duped the president of the
Campus Club into running for pres-
ident of the student body on a re-
form platform. The gullible dupe,
Alfred Nephew, was swept into of-
fice in a popular wave of enthusiasm
for liberal ideals.

Meanwhile Quitepinksky had built
up his own system of cells through-
out the University, which he ran
with an iron hand.

But an alert group, the Conserva-
tive Society, began to see the ex-
tent of Communist infiltration here.

They began a series of spectacu-
lar hearings in which the entire
Executive Committee was found to
be a Communist tool. Half the facul-
ty was proven to be in on the plot.

The Board of Trustees, then as
now strongly anti-Communist,
purged the faculty and threw all the
Communists and consymps out of
school.

The school was spared and per-
haps the whole Communist move-
ment in the U.S. was nipped in the
bud.

The sobering story of this plot
was made into a documentary movie,
“Communist Infiltration, 1902.”

Backfield Changes
Will Boost Attack

By ED NORTON

The Washington and Lee Generals,
hoping to preserve the longest win-
ning streak in Virginia football,
resume their 1961 season tomorrow
at Lancastter, Pa., against the Frank-
lin and Marshall Diplomats.

The Generals, 7-6 victors over
Hampden-Sydney in their season
opener two weeks ago, will be
shooting for their second win this
fall.

Changes

Head Coach Lee McLaughlin will
send his charges into tomorrow’s
game with two new additions in the
starting backfield.

Charlie Gummey and Tommy
Keesee have moved up from the
second unit to the first squad, re-
placing Jim Hickey and Doug Mar-
tin.

Gummey, a 195-pound halfback,
and Keesee, 185-pounder, will add
power running to the W&L back-
field, which has been hurt, accord-
ing to McLaughlin, by a lack of
“punishing runners.”

Hickey, at 165 pounds, and Martin,
at 155, are both primarily breaka-
way runners, who are at their best
moving away from the line instead
of into it.

Gummey and Keesee will team
with quarterback Steve Suttle and
right halfback Jim Russ on the
Washington Blue team.

Martin will be used as*a wild
card in the General offense, which
operates with three separate teams,
the blue, red and gold units.

In the line, McLaughlin plans only
one change for the F&M game.

Tougher

McLaughlin called the Diplomats
“much tougher than last year,”
when the Generals ran up an easy
38-6 victory.

Assistant Coach Boyd Williams,
who scouted the Dips 13-9 loss to
Johns Hopkins last week, said that
F&M has an “experienced and cap-
able line that held the Hopkins
offense in check most of the after-
noon.”

“They got it up front. There’s no
doubt about that,” said Williams.

Williams’ scouting report described
the 1961 Franklin and Marshall
squad as the best the Generals have
faced in their four-year rivalry with
the Pennsylvania school.

The Generals are on the short end
of the record now, having dropped
two out of three decisions to the
Diplomats.

Good Shape

Physically, the Generals should be
in good shape, after an open date
last week.

Both Terry Fohs and Martin, who
were on the questionable list last
week after minor injuries, will be
ready to go.

Baby Generals
Play Ferrum

Junior College

The Washington and Lee Baby
Generals, plauged by injuries, meet
Ferrum Junior College tomorrow
afternoon in their second game of
the season.

In last week’s 12-0 loss to Wood-
berry Forest, halfback Bill Jamison
fractured an ankle and _ fullback
Bruce Kurtz joined co-captain Dan
Manson on the injured list, the
result of a fractured rib.

These injuries have forced Coach
Swan to move 125-lb. quarterback
Gordon Gray to full, and co-captain
Chase to wingback. Rounding out
the backfield will be Doug Davis,
either Bill Lee or Ed (Rocket)
Bradbury, and Bill David.

Ferrum tied the VMI “Rats” 20-
20 last week, and are expected to
be the biggest and possibly best
team the Brigaders will face all
year.

Coach Swan said, “We’re de-
pending on our defense to get us

Coach Mac Is

Cautious; He
Remembers °59

By STEVE HENRY

“We just can’t forget what hap-
pened the last time we went to
Lancaster.”

Washington and Lee head coach
Lee McLaughlin was talking about
tomorrow’s game with the Frank-
lin and Marshall Diplomats.

The “last time” that McLaughlin
referred to was 1959, when the Gen-
erals, after two straight lop-sided
victories, traveled to Lancaster to
meet the supposedly weak Dips,
only to come out on the short end
of a 28-14 score.

“We got cocky in ’59,” said Mc-
Laughlin. “They just bombed us off
the field.”

McLaughlin, however is not pes-
simistic, only cautious, about tomor-
row’s contact.

With his multi-Star Generals in
good physical shape, McLaughlin’s
charges will enter the F&M game
heavy favorites.

McLaughlin himself admits that
he’s got the material to duplicate
last year’s 38-6 win over the Diplo-
mats.

“They’re tougher this year,
though,” he warns. “They played
Hopkins to a standstill last week,
and Hopkins is plenty tough.”

“But we've got the talent if we just
use it, especially on offense,” he
added.

In the Hampden-Sydney game two
weeks ago, won by the Generals
7-6, McLaughlin’s multi-teamed of-
fense suffered, due mainly to a lack
of adequate downfield blocking.

Only a third quarter sustained
touchdown drive salvaged the Gen-
erals’ undefeated string.

Since then, McLaughlin has sent
his linemen through repeated prac-
tice sessions on blocking, stressing
downfield contact.

“The backs can go if we get the
blocking,” said McLaughlin.

“Our biggest problem this week
is mental. We’ve got to be up or
it could be ’59 all over again.”

ings Dances, announced today that
Joe Tex and the Dukes of Rhythm

Booters Gain
First Victory,

2-1 Over R-M

By BOB BROWN

Freshman wing Gil Slingerland
come up with a late game goal
Wednesday that handed the Wash-
ington and Lee soccer team a 2-1
decision over Randolph-Macon Col-
lege.

The win evened the Generals’ sea-
son record at 1-1.

Head coach Joe Lyles singled out
Slingerland, Steve Hibbard, and
Bruce Jackson for their play. Hib-
bard and Jackson were substituting
for first-stringers Tom Clements and
Dunlop Ecker, who were out of ac-
tion due to injuries.

He also praised Bill Outman and
Bob Pagano for their offensive show-
ings, which repeatedly put the Gen-
erals in scoring position against Ma-
con,

In all, the Generals pushed some
22 scoring attempts past the Yellow
Jacket defense.

Lyles, however, is concerned with
apparent weaknesses in passing.

on October 6 in the season’s third
game.

week, designed to help fraternity
I-M managers get organized, which
is presently quite hard to do because
of a general lack of information
on I-M schedules.

The editorial staff of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi feels, however, that
this proposed coverage of intramur-
als will be totally impossible without
the complete cooperation of the fra-
ternities.

It will be necessary for each
house to appoint or assign someone
to give the information to the intra-
mural editor when he calls the
house, probably on Wednesday
night, to get I-M information.

If this information is too spotty
or nil, then it naturally follows that
the idea of “Intramural Round-Up”
will fold with great rapidity.

We respectfully request your help
in making this venture at least a
moderate success.

Try-outs for the Washington and

before next Thursday, when further
qualification trials will be held.

Approximately 20 boys are trying

Student Library Committee Sets New Fines

The following standard minimum fines for specific
library offenses were adopted at a meeting of the Stu-
dent Library Committee on September 27, 1961, and
were submitted to the Executive Committee of the Stu-

dent Body for approval:

NOTE: The purpose of this rule is to make a definite
and well defined means of distinguishment between
regular reserve books and locked reserve books.

At the present time, a locked reserve book that is
checked out from the Library can conceiveably be kept
out for an indefinite period of time, provided the
student is willing to pay a fine of 10 cents per hour.

This is the same rule that applies to a regular re-
serve book at the present time. Thus, in actuality,

new rule he would not be charged 10 cents per hour
fine; instead, he would appear before the Student
Library Committee.

In this day, the deplorable situation of having only

three books to serve 50 students should be alleviated

to some extent.

there is no difference between a locked reserve book

and regular reserve book with the exception of the
fact that the former are kept behind the librarian’s

desk.

Thus, by adding the above rule to library regula-
tions, the Student Library Committee hopes to make
locked reserve a meaningful and effective part of our

Library operation.

Should a student be guilty of not returning a
locked reserve book at the designated time, under this

4. Mutilation

In the event that this regulation is approved, a
notice to this effect will be given to all professors us-
ing locked reserve in order that they can inform their
classes with regard to this matter.

2. Unauthorized removal of a reserve book and
any 14-day book (removing a book from the library
without properly checking it out) is subject to a
minimum fine of $10.00.

3. The intentional hiding of any book or periodical
is subject to a minimum fine of $20.00.

of a book or periodical involving

underscores or similar offenses will be subject to a
minimum fine of $2.00.

5.Wilful destruction of any library book or perioid-

ical will be subject to a fine of $50.00. Deliberate des-

truction includes intentionally tearing out pages and
riping up the book.
