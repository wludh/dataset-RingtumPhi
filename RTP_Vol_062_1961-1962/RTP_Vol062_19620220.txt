‘Othello’ Scheduled For

Troubadour Production

“Othello,” now in rehearsal at the
Troubadour Theatre, is scheduled to
be one of the largest productions
ever held by the Troub players.

More than 25 persons will take
part in the play which will run
March 14-17.

Bob Allen, senior from Park Hills,
Ky., will be appearing as Othello.

Allen, who is a fine arts major,
appeared last year in the title role
of the highly acclaimed “Henry IV.”
He has taken part in numerous other
Troubadour productions, among
them Christopher Fry’s “The Lady
Is Not for Burning.”

John Dunnell, president of the
Troubadours, will portray Iago.

Dunnell, a junior from New York,
is a veteran of Troub productions,
having appeared in every show
done at Washington and Lee since
he came here.

Appearing as Roderigo will be Tim
Morton, a junior from Roanoke.
Morton appeared last season in all
three Troub shows. His last role
was that of Napoleon in Bernard
Shaw’s “Man of Destiny.”

Sophomore Steve Colvin, making a
second appearance at thetheatre,
will be seen as Cassio. He appeared
this past fall in “Boy Meets Girl.”

The leading feminine role of Des-

demona will be done by Lisa Tracy,
a student at Lexington High School.
Miss Tracy is a veteran of several
Troub productions, although this is
the first time she has appeared in
a role of this scope.

The part of Emilia will be por-
trayed by Josephine Unger, a facul-
ty member of Southern Seminary.
She first appeared her last year in
“Man of Destiny.”

Major supporting roles are held by
Andy Leonard, appearing as Lodo-
vico; Terry Van Brunt as Montano,
Gay Reading as Gratiano, Andy
Adelson as the Duke of Venice, and
Deborah Johnson as Bianca.

Curtain time for each performance
is to be at 8:15 pm. The play is
under the direction of Dr. Cecil
Jones.

» Pi Kappa Phi had a 1.471 rating
for fifth place.

The all men’s average for first
semester was 1.392, as opposed to
1,387 for the second semester of
last year.

The list reveals that only six
fraternities were above the all
men’s average, and that the non-
fraternity men were also above
the all men’s average with a 1.465
rating.

Twelve fraternities fell below the
all men’s average.

Phi Delta Theta finished last on
the list with a 1.217 average.

Last year PEP finished first for
both semesters. The second semes-
ter of last year saw that fraternity
total a 2.060 average.

ZBT finished second with a 1.643
average for first semester last year,
and Lambda Chi Alpha took sec-
ond place for the second semester
with a 1.768.

The all men’s average this semes-
ter rose by .005 over second semes-
ter last year, and by .076 over the
first semester figure.

The number of fraternities above
the all men’s average is the same as
the last semester of 1960-61 when
six houses were above the 1.387 all
men’s mark.

For the first semester of 1960-61
seven houses were above the all
men’s average of 1.316.

The only change in the houses
above the all men’s average is Kap-
pa Sigma which rose from 12th at
second semester last year to sixth
this year.

 

 

| IFC Creates Group To Study Rush

A petition already signed by 20 members of the Washington and Lee faculty which would
have rush week moved to the first week of the sophomore year was read by Dean E. C. At-
wood at last night’s IFC meeting.

The petition, Dean Atwood explained, did not represent the entire faculty, but it repre-
sents a sizeable segment of that body.

The article was distributed to different faculty members a few days ago, and the petition
is expected to get nearly 50 per cent of the faculty’s names signed to it before circulation

of it is completed.

“We, the undersigned,” the petition states, “request that the administration study the
advisibility of deferring rushing and pledging in the social fraternities until the week preced-
ing the opening of school in the sophomore year and initiation until a time preceding the start

of the second semester.”

 

Glenn Returns
After 5 Hours
In Outer Space

From the Associated Press Wire

The lift-off of the Atlas
rocket signaled the end of a
series of delays and launched
this country on another step in
efforts to catch up with Russia
in the race into space. The
rocket hurled the spacecraft—
called “Friendship Seven” af-
ter the seven astronauts—into
an egg-shaped orbit, ranging
from 100 to 160 miles high,
at a speed of around 17,500

miles an hour.

The 40-year old Marine Lieuten-
ant Colonel—describing a panoramic
view of the earth—called it a tre-
mendous and beautiful sight. The
astronaut ate a meal of beef and
vegetagles through a squeeze bot-
tle. And he is controlling the atti-
tude of his capsule and making in-
strument readings to tracking sta-
tions.

The hearts of Americans and for-
eigners traveled with Glenn as he
circled around and around the globe.

Passing over Australia, he sighted
the lights of the city of Perth. Near-
ly all lights in the city had been
turned on by residents as a good-
will gesture toward the space pi-
oneer. Glenn told an astronaut mon-
itoring the flight: “Thank everybody
for turning them on.”

Glenn said he felt real good as he
made the second pass over Cape
Canaveral. He made the the report
to another pioneer astronaut Alan
Shepherd.

of the second semester of the freshman year.

3. It would allow time for a

proper evaluation by both fra-

ternities and prospective members.

4. It would strengthen class ties*
and develop a sense of pride in the
University.

5. It would eliminate the stigma
sometimes attached to non-fraterni-
ty students.

“We request that a report of this
study be given at a regular meeting
of the faculty in the near future,”
the petition states.

Atwood Explains

Dean Atwood explained to the
IFC that the petition has not yet
been officially received by the Ad-
ministration, and that the procedure
for handling it have not yet been
fully determined.

Atwood expressed the view that
an IFC study on possible revisions
in the rush system would be helpful
at this time.

He further added that the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities would
have to be brought into the picture
before the petition was directed to
the Administration.

Dean Atwood left the IFC meet-
ing early last night to attend a
session with the Executive Com-
mittee. He told the Ring-tum Phi
this morning that the petition was
also discussed at the EC meeting.

IFC Sets Up Committee

The IFC elected to set up a com-
mittee to study possible revisions
and IFC President Bob Doenges said
that a chairman would be named
within the next few days.

It was pointed out in the IFC

meeting that a study was conducted
two years ago on possible rush re-

 

 

visions, but that any change was
voted down at that time.

“Will Close Six Houses”

In speaking about the new pro-
posed system brought forward by
the petition, Doenges said that he
expected that at least six of the
fraternities would be forced to close
if such a system involving sophomore
rush were started.

He clarified this statement by say-
ing that the new system would in-
volve a year’s operation without a
freshman class, an element necessary
to financing the fraternities.

Strongly Opposes System

Discussion among IFC members
indicated that the IFC, as a whole,
strongly opposed the system.

It is expected that W&L’s rushing
system will be discussed at tonight's
Faculty Discussion Group.

In other IFC business, the group
passed the Help Week proposals for
the last time, thereby placing the
proposals in the IFC Constitution.

The IFC voted also to continue
the same foreign student plan for
this semester.

It was reported that $54.00 was
collected during Help Week for the
March of Dimes Campaign by five
fraternities.

Finally, the “Wheels for Johnson”
campaign was brought back to the
IFC. A report was made that showed
the electrical cart given the fresh-
man dorm janitor three years ago
needs repairs. The IFC voted to

Student Leaders Favor New Constitution

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The Executive Committee is cur-
rently considering two important
proposals for changes in the Student
Body Constitution.

The first of these provides for a
new voting system whereby candi-
dacy for office will
be based simply
upon a petition of
fifty students.

The second
measure provides
for the elimina-
tion of the Pub-
lications Board
representative to
the EC along with
one of the Senior
Class representa-
tives, and the es-
two members-at-

large.

of

In a series of interviews, this re-
porter has tried to determine the
relative support for the proposals
and what significance, of any, they
are expected to bear if they are
passed.

Uncas McThenia, president of the
student body, said that one of the

 

Ww

All Approve Elimination Of Nomination Convention

important changes which the new
proposed voting system will bring
about is the abolition of the
“cumbersome machinery of nomi-
nating conventions.”

He added that “it will further-
more afford minority groups the
opportunity to run candidates.

“Under the present system, only
two candidates can run for an
office. If the new measure is passed,
this restriction will be done away
with.”

Meade Christian, junior class rep-
resentative to the EC, stated that
the proposed voting system would
not break down the two big party
cliques, but would serve, in theory
at least, to open up the candidacy
to any and all who are qualified.

Like McThenia, Christian believes
that a major benefit from the change
would be the elimination of the
nominating convention.

“In past years,” he commented, “it
has been a mere farce—just a rubber
stamp for the two party nominees.”

Christian further approves the

Ww Ww

elimination of the Publications rep-
resentative.

“All representatives,” he stated,
“should be elected without exception
by popular vote.”

Howard Slater, chairman of the
Independent Party, felt that the
proposed voting system would only
serve to strengthen the two party
cliques.

“The parties would realize that
they could never get a man into
office unless the houses stick together
in their respective parties. Other-
wise, it would be a matter of indi-
vidual houses competing against
each other,” Slater remarked.

Commenting on the elimination of
the Publications Board representa-
tive, Slater stated that having one
of the newspaper editors on the
EC results in the editorials having a
slanted view.

“The Ring-tum Phi is continually
praising the EC without presenting
any other perspective to the Com-
mittee,” Slater added.

Rosie Page, a senior class repre-

 

 

Ww Ww

sentative and a former Ring-tum Phi
editor, considers that to eliminate
the Publications representative
would be a bad mistake.

“In the four years I have been
here, this representative has con-
sistently been one of the most ef-
fective members of the Committee,
Page commented.

Page further objected to the elim-
ination of one of the two senior class
representatives.

“The two members-at-large,” he
said, “would result in too much
flexibility and would not guarantee
proportional representation.”

Steve Suttle, secretary of the
student body, favors the new pro-
posal of candidacy by petition not
for any effect it may have on the
party cliques, but because it would
cut out the “sterile” nominating
convention.

Secondly, he added that “it would
offer all groups and in particular
the non-fraternity group, a chance
to run a man for office.”

Suttle supports the elimination of}

 

Ww

the Publications Board representa-
tive and states that he can see no
reason why “a more distributed
representation does not exist here as
it does with the other eleven mem-
bers.”

Rick Frisbie, president of the
Kappa Sig house, stated that the
need for change in our voting sys-
tem does exist and our present two-
party organization is not necessarily
getting the best man elected.

Frisbie, however, does not feel
that the present voting proposals
will effect the needed changes.

He advocates, rather a system like
that at UVa., where voting is done
on an individual basis and each
house sends delegates to the nomi-
nating poles in the same way that
states do in electorial colleges.

Ray Robrecht, vice-president of
the student body, sees that the new
voting system would not change
the dual party structure, but on the
other hand it is unfair for the Con-
stitution to overlook the minority
groups.

 

“We should not restrict elections
to just two candidates per office,”
Robrecht stated, “but rather give
anyone who wants the chance to
attain nomination.”

Robrecht, speaking in regard to
the Publications representative, feels
that a Ring-tum Phi editor should
not be on the EC.

“It is not effective journalism for
one thing,” he stated.

Bill Lowry, editor of Protest
agrees with the above that the new
proposals for voting would not have
been any considerable effect upon
the party system, but does open up
possibilities for the minority groups
on campus.

Concerning the Publications rep-
resentative, Lowry said he objected
to having this member on_ the
grounds that he is appointed and
not popularly elected.”

The consistency of he above re-
marks indicate a great deal as to
what course the measures ought to
take.

They are still open for alteration
by the EC before being voted on.
The Ring-tum Phi will report furth-
er on these proposals as they are
being considered before the Com-
mittee.

A New Rush System?

The Tuesday Edition has learned that sentiment for a new
rush system here is held by a number of W&L faculty mem-
bers.

Our sources have indicated that one such plan under con-
sideration would delay rush week until the opening of the first
semester of the sophomore year.

Since these feelings are only in the planning stage at pres-
ent, we would like to voice our opinion about possible changes
to be made in our rush system.

 

(1) Any change in the rush system must not come from
the faculty or from the Administration, but from the IFC.

(2) The IFC members should be notified if change is in
order so that they can possibly come up with some workable
solution to the question.

(3) That the faculty members who hold the belief that
rush should be changed place trust in the IFC by allowing that
organization to discuss the problem before an “‘ultimatum”’ is
handed down by the Administration or by the faculty.

The plan to delay rush until the first semester of the sopho-
more year, if adopted, in our opinion would close from five to
six of the fraternities.

Since such a plan would see one full year of fraternity op-
eration without the support from one entire class, we can only
predict doom for some of the houses. It is our hope that this
plan would not be accepted either by the IFC or by the Ad-
ministration.

It must be remembered by those who would change our
present system that just two years ago the IFC rejected plans
for rush revision. Their rejection of any revision should indi-
cate that the fraternities are generally satisfied with the present
system although their vote doesn’t make the present plan right.

Perhaps, however, a new system could be passed this year,
but we can see no real need for adopting such a radical plan as
delaying rush to the sophomore year.

We can understand that our present system has its bad
points, namely that the first thing the freshman sees of Wash-
ington and Lee is not the University but the fraternities.

It also must be remembered that our present system does
have its good points too, primarily that rush comes and goes
really before school gets into full swing.

To reiterate a bit, we exert that any changes should come
from the IFC, and not from faculty members who would see a
plan adopted that would close a number of fraternities.

Sensible reasoning is the only answer to this question.

EC N il Maal Member

The Executive Committee, after a considerable length of
time, has made public the proposed changes in our Student
Body Constitution. The new Constitution, as presented by the
the Executive Committee would seek to make our Student Gov-
ernment more effective and efficient.

On the whole, the new Constitution embodies sound prin-
ciples and should prove to be a benefit to our Student Body.
However, one of the proposed changes would eliminate from
membership on the Executive Committee the Representative
from the Publications Board. We feel that this change would be
an unwise step.

In the past, the representatives from the Publications Board
to the Executive Committee have been highly capable indi-
viduals. Their past records show that they have had the in-
terest, ability and responsibility necessary to serve on such a
position.

One must remember that the Publications Board represents
the largest single group of extra curricula activities in the Uni-
versity. Through the several publications, student activities and
information are publicized. The members of the Publications

By DR. W. W. PUSEY
Dean of the College

The spectacular successes of Rus-
sian technology and science during
the past five years have inevitably
aroused widespread interest
throughout the free world in the
Soviet educational system. Compari-
sons have been made between Rus-
sian and American education largely
to the detriment of the latter.

A recent book entitled What Ivan
Knows That Johnny Doesn’t—the
title itself is characteristic—explains
“why the American student is infer-
ior to the Russian child in almost
every area of intellectual achieve-
ment.”

A recent study on Education and |
the |
U.S.S.R. demonstrates that the So- |
*viets are outproducing the United

Professional Employment in

States in the training of engineers
and scientists by a substantial mar-
gin and that the proportion of uni-
versity graduates going into teach-
ing is more than twice that of the
United States. The achievements of
Soviet scientists in nuclear physics
point up the uncomfortable fact that
science, at least, can develop despite
the conformity imposed by a totali-
tarian society.

It is essential to an understand-
ing of Russian education to re-
member that schools in the
U.S.S.R. are an instrument of na-
tional policy, consciously used to
create the new Soviet man and
to advance the economic and mili-
tary strength of the Soviet state, a
goal which education can be made
to serve efficiently. As early as
1919 Lenin stated that it was one
of the tasks of the Communist
Party to transform the schools into
“an instrument for the Communist
regeneration of Society.”

The basic unit of Soviet educa-
tion is the ten (now eleven) year
school. In thinly populated areas
there are generally only four-year
primary schools, and in district cen-
ters and cities seven (now eight)
year schools. The corresponding

ent to the American primary, junior
high, and senior high schools—fol-

Campusing Of Freshman Draws Attack
On Work Of Student Control Committee

criticism previously aimed at Dean
Atwood is commendable.

However, in spite of Bill’s com-
ments, I feel their decision to cam-
pus said freshman was an immature
one. The fact remains that a college
student has been punished in a
fashion not unsimilar to punitive ac-
tions employed by prep schools.
Also, it is a fact that Dean Atwood
signed his name to the Committee’s
decision, indicating his approval of
the measures to be taken.

I am fully aware that to offer cri-
ticism without an alternative is
equally as immature as this decision.
It is this student’s opinion, consid-
ering the severity of this freshman’s
action, that he be asked to leave
Washington and Lee for the re-
mainder of the present semester.

Certainly such a repulsive display
of upbringing warrants a period of
self-examination free from academic
| pressures. If memory serves me
correctly, men have been asked to
drop out of the University for les-
ser offenses.

In the future 1 hope Dean Atwood
will offer guidance and sound judg-
ment complementary to his position.

This letter is in no sense an ef-
fort to be unduly caustic. Last Mon-
day, after glancing at the ODK
Board, I was thoroughly ashamed
of Washington and Lee. It is not
out of personal vengence, but con-
cern, that I write the Editor of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Sincerely,

physical powers.
Now on to greener pastures, the
E. C.

I'm very interested in their pro-
posal to move around some of
their responsibility by taking
away the position held by a mem-
ber of the Publications Board, and
also demoting a senior. I heart-
ily support representative govern-
ment, and I interpret this propos-
al on the part of the EC as an
attempt to make our government
even more representative than it
really is.

I feel that they have sensed one
of the shortcomings of student gov-
ernment here at Washington and
Lee and are taking some bold steps
aimed at correction. Getting rid of
members representing minorities is
important.

But I feel that substituting mem-
bers-at-large is not the right an-
swer to this problem. A member-at-
large by definition would be a blow
to to the solidarity of the organiza-
tion. No longer could the majority
count on each other. And the qual-
ity of candidates would inevitably
fall. A non-fraternity man might
even be chosen.

So I submit my alternative solu-
tion to the EC Representative Re-
vision Plan.

It is short, simple, and a true
American solution to the problems
with which we’re faced in this grave
hour of need.

Since the proposal is aimed at
taking representation away from
non-representative minorities, I
suggest that it be given to more
representative minorities.

Thas is, the members of the EC
are usually very active students to
begin with. A member of the Pub-
lications Board could become a
a member of the EC as a class
representative. But some minori-
ties are utterly without chance of
representation of any sort.

I propose that the EC create posts
for a representative from the Mon-
golian Minks and from the basket-
ball team.

As you all know the Minks were
the center of a minor controversy
last fall. They have now repented
and wish to take part in more con-
ventional campus activities.

I've already mentioned _ their
weekly political discussions, and
now I think it’s time that the EC
give the Minks their due and bring
them into the campus family so to
speak.

I think that the Minks would show
their usual mature judgment and
conscientious behavior, and thus

sian child made by the schools have
caused concern even to Russian
pedagogues. The ten-year curricu-
lum, with classes meeting six days
a week for 33 weeks, adds up to
about the same number of days in
an American twelve-year course.
There is a very heavy emphasis on
science; and mathematics, chemistry,
biology, and especially physics, are
taught in larger doses in Soviet
schools than in most schools in the
West, taking up over a third of the
total number of hours in the second-
ary school.

The casualty rate in the regular
school system is extraordinarily
high; it has been estimated that less
than 15 per cent of those who begin
primary school will graduate from
high school. This means, as Fred M.
Hechinger has pointed out in The
Big Red Schoolhouse, that the
U.S.S.R. does not have mass educa-
tion as we understand it, but rath-
er a system of public education
which allows all children to enter
elementary school and _ virtually
guarantees their right to basic lit-
eracy as well as to competition for
the right to secondary and higher
education.

The Soviet student knows that
if he fails to measure up at any
point to the requirements he is
likely to be left behind, and thus
to have lost his opportunity to
escape the drabness of ordinary
existence in the Soviet Union and
to have lost his chance to as-
pire to the more glamorous and
remunerative life of the scientist,
University-trained technician, or
member of the intelligentsia. This
realization serves as a compelling
incentive to motivate the student
to work always at his maximum
capacity. The educational chips
are continually down.

For the minority who complete
the high school, there are two types
of higher educational institution
available, the many and varied tech-
nical institutions and the 40-odd
universities. Attendance at all class-
es at these institutions is obliga-
tory, although recently some leni-
ency has been allowed to encourage
independent work. According to a
new ruling, most University appli-
cants will not be considered for ad-
mission until they have completed
one or two years of “productive la-
bor.”

The summit of Soviet higher edu-
cation is “Moscow State University
of the Order of Lenin and of the Or-
der of the Red Banner of Labor,
Named for M. V. Lomonosov.” Rus-
sia’s oldest university, dating from
1755, it has such distinguished alum-
ni as the writers Lermontov, Tur-
genev, and Chekhov.

Moscow University is housed in a
new plant consisting of 37 buildings
clustered around a central skyscrap-
per, which has been described by
Burton Rubin as an “ornate minia-
ture” of the Empire State Building.
It has an undergraduate enrollment
of about 22,000, with a resident stu-
dent-professor ratio of 6.6-1.

Only straight A students or those
with influential connections have a
chance of being admitted to Moscow
University, and more than 90 per
cent receive financial aid from the
state. Six hours of class attendance
a day are compulsory for freshmen.
The program of study in the univer-
sities and technical institutes is de-
signed to prepare specialists rather
than to give a broad education in
the sciences and humanities.

It would be idle to deny the
achievements of the Soviet educa-
tional system. Within a single gen-
eration illiteracy has been reduc-
ed from 60-65 per cent to perhaps
5-10 per cent. The rudiments of
scientific knowledge have been
transmitted to a vast population
not far removed from serfdom.
Great advances have been made in
science and technology and in the
training of specialists in these
fields on a lower, middle, and
higher level.

As George S. Counts indicates, no
other society in history has ever
committed itself so unreservedly to
the development of mathematics and
science. The U.S.S.R. spends more
than twice as much of its gross na-
tional product on education as does
the United States.

These accomplishments, however,
should not blind us to the serious
flaws in the Soviet educational sys-
tem. Originally, spontaneity, and in-
dependence of mind are largely
eliminated by the inflexibility and

VMI Wins Meet

Hickey, Essex, Kell Pace Generals
To Fifth Place In State Indoor Track

Jim Hickey, Skip Essex, and Rob-
in Kell paced the Generals to a fifth
place finish in the fourth annual
Virginia Indoor Track Meet, at the
VMI fieldhouse Saturday.

W. and M. Second
VMI captured its fourth straight
title, followed by William and Mary,
Virginia, Virginia Tech, and W&L.
The Generals had a total 12 1/5
points.

W&L’s showing was quite an
improvement over last year when
it wound up ninth in a field of
11. This year it took fifth with
only ten men entered in the meet.

Hickey grabbed third in the 60-
yard dash with a fast 6.3. Essex
came in second in the 880-yard run
with a 2:06.0 after winning the trials
in 2:09.4.

nals of the hop-step-jump by a
mere two inches. His best jump
was 39-8.

Paced by freshman Dave Kille-

of West Virginia.

A crowd of over 250 sports enthusiasts supported the two
W&L teams, both of which went down in defeat. The mermen
were outclassed by the Panthers and lost.

Dick Miller’s wrestlers lacked that “‘little bit of luck” and
were edged by the Mounties, 16-12.

Charlie Gummy and Eliott Maynard were the only bright
spots for the swimmers against Pitt, but the whole wrestling
team showed a great effort in meeting West Virginia.

Swimming

The Panthers of Pitt took first in
both the 400-yd medley relay and
the 400-yd. freestyle relay, going the
distances in respective times of 5:45.2
and 3:25.2.

Records Fall

Pitt's Ganong bettered the old
pool record by over seven seconds
with a time of 2:05.4 in the 220-yd.
freestyle, defeating McManus and
Wolfe of W&L. Later in the meet,
Ganong again shattered a pool rec-
ord, winning the 440-yd. freestyle
event with a time of 4:59.8.

Ron Levine of Pitt turned in a
spectacular performance by first set-
ting a new record in the 200-yd. in-
dividual medley with a time of 2:06.9
and also shattering the previous
record in the 200-yd. butterfly with
a time of 2:05.8.

His brother, Rob, also made his
addition to Pitt's record break-

ing evening by scoring a first in
the 200-yd. backstroke event, go-
ing the distance in a record time
of 2:01.8 seconds.

In the one meter diving compe-
tition, Pitt’s Perez, after having in-
jured his leg on the first dive, went
ahead to take a first in the event.

Wrestling

In two matches, the 123 and 147
lb. classes, the score was tied with
less than a minute remaining, but
both wins were salvaged by West
Virginia in the closing seconds.

Taken Down

Butch West, wrestling in the 123
lb. slot for the Generals, was taken
down with thirty-two seconds left
by Dave Cain to come out on the
short end of a 4-2 score.

In the 147 Ib. division, newcom-
er Pete Winfield was taken down
by crowd pleaser Sam Church
with 31 seconds remaining, to lose
5-4.

Both Dick Albert and Herbie
Smith turned in fine performances
in holding their opponents to 1-1
and 7-7 draws respectively.

Babcock Loses

Sandy Mersereau at 157 was
edged 3-0, while Jud Babcock at
heavyweight, wrestling the Mount-
ies best man, lost, 4-0.

Winning for the Generals were
Dave Montgomery with a pin and
Tom Stover who decisioned his
man, 12-0.

WEGEL Drops
Two Contests
On Journey

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team dropped two consecutive
games this past weekend, the first,
on Friday night, to Catholic Univer-
sity, by the one-sided score of 83-52,
and the second, by 73-70, at the
hands of Washington College.

At one point in the Catholic Uni-
versity game, the Generals led 24-23,
but Catholic started hitting more
consistently from the floor and took
at 14-point lead by half-time.

The W&L scoring attack was
led by Tom Supak with 18 points
and Louie Paterno with 10.

On Saturday, the W&L five was
edged by a 72-70 margin. Although
Washington led by eleven points at
the half, W&L came back and with
4:30 to go tied the count at 62-62.

After the ball had changed hands
three times and the score still even,
Washington took advantage of a
missed shot, took control, and went
on to win by three points. Tom Su-
pak again led the Generals scoring
attack with 21 and ‘Bip’ Fauber tos-
sed in 17.

AMA Edges
Frosh, 62-61

Augusta Military Academy’s fresh-
man basketball team handed the
Baby Generals their fourth straight
defeat, 62-61, in a game played at
Staunton last Saturday.

A.M.A, took the lead from the
start and by halftime led 34-26.
Dick Livingston and Scott Verner
sparked a second half surge which
saw W&L take a five point lead
with three minutes remaining.
The defeat not only left the fresh-

man searching for victory number
eight, but was most costly in that
first stringers Livingston and George
Madison were injured and might
miss the remaining games.

Generals ‘New Look’ Offense
Will Feature Power, Passing

Washington and Lee’s football team will feature a

look”’ offense this fall.

The five-star
switching from a speedy ground
attack to a combination of power
running and passing.

With the graduation of speedsters
Jim Hickey and Doug Martin, two
of the offensive mainstays on the
undefeated 1961 club, the Generals
are left without a fast horse in their
stables.

Power

All top returnees in the backfield
are “bullish power runners rather
than speed demons,” according to
head coach Lee McLaughlin.

First among these “power” run-
ners are rising seniors Charlie Gum-
mey (halfback), Tommy Keesee
(fullback) and Chuck Lane (quar-
terback) and rising junior Stuart
Yoffe (halfback).

Together these four amassed
1,016 of the total 2,182 yards that
the Generals gained by rushing last
year.

Plans call for a stepped-up air
attack this fall because McLaughlin
says he will have an “overall bet-
ter group of passers and receivers.”
The balding Coach quickly adds that
by “better” he means “more experi-
enced” since eight of the Generals
top 12 receivers and two of the top

four passers are back for more
aerial fireworks.
After watching his charges in a

week and a half of spring practice,
McLaughlin says he expects W&L’s
offense to remain on a close par with
the 1961 club which boasted a scor-
ing average of 33.0 points per game.

Defense, however, is the big ques-
tion mark as the Generals enter
their first season as a member of the
newly formed College Athletic Con-
ference. They carry a string of 19
straight games without a loss into
their conference competition with
Centre, Sewanee and Southwestern.

The loss of the first three guards
and Little All-American Center and
linebacker Terry Fohs, the team’s
leading tackler for the past three
years, are the causes of anxiety.

In the past, the member from the Publications Board on

Furthermore, we feel that the Student Body should have a

regimentation of Russian educa-
tional methods. Since only achieve-
ment is rewarded and potential ap-
titude ignored, valuable human re-
sources are lost.

Rigidity, conformity and thought
control prevail from primary school
through the university. Claims made
for the achievements of high school
graduates even in science appear
exaggerated in comparison with the
accomplishments of high school
graduates in some countries of
Western Europe.

The quest for truth for its own
sake, the cornerstone of Western,
democratic education, is unthink-
able in the U.S.S.R., where educa-
tion and students are inhumanly
manipulated in an Orwellian fash-
ion to produce the technical la-
bor the State deems necessary to
achieve its social and_ political
aims.

Efficient as it has certainly proved
to be in science and technology,
Russian education will nonetheless
seem abhorrent to most educators
in the Western World. It cannot,
however, be ignored, because we
detest it. It is there, powerful and
ruthless, a challenge to the freedom-
loving, sometimes too easy-going
West.

would fit right in with the current

As for the post for the basket-
ball team, I feel it is only fair
to let this much maligned minor-
ity into the realm of politics.

In answer to the charge of “dumb
jocks” that might arise, I point to
last week’s column which was a
lengthy discussion of the team’s
gentlemanly conduct and sense of
fair play.

This team is made up of the sort
of people whom I think could best
administer the needs of the Student
Body.

And I think by taking their minds
off basketball and putting them into
politics we could do the school a
double service.

Other suggestions I have for the
EC are too lengthy.

So Ill do like they do, and wait
until there is sufficient space for

verbosity.
