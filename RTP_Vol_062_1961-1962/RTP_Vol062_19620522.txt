Life Savers
Cite Cargill
For Bravery

It was a strange turn of luck that
enabled three Washington and Lee
students to save a 57-year-old man
from drowning Saturday.

The students happened to hear
the man yelling for help because
they met a car carrying some friends,
and stopped on the road. James Car-
gill, Allen Northcutt, and Tom Ed-
wards found Gilbert Blackwell
clinging to a tree on the side of a
high cliff above Maury River. They
stayed to watch him while others
called the Lexington rescue squad.

Blackwell Falls From Cliff

Before the rescue squad could
arrive, the man fell from the cliff
into the river. The trio immediately
decided to go to his aid, and they
were lucky enough to have brought
an inner tube in their car. They
used the tube to float Blackwell
to the shore.

Cargill said that a farmer living
in the area had heard Blackwell
shouting for about an hour, but
hadn’t been able to locate him.
Blackwell had been walking on the
top of the cliff when he fell.

Didn’t Know Help Had Arrived

The students could not know how
long Blackwell had been hanging
on the cliff; or the fact that his
vision is so poor that he couldn’t
see that help had arrived. Cargill
said he had thought the man could
see him, but later learned that
Blackwell is close to being blind.

Praised Highly

As a result of the rescue the three
were pictured on the front page of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and
received notice in other papers also.

The captain of the Lexington Life
Saving and First Aid Crew, Roy
Snyder, wrote a letter to President
Cole in praise of the rescue. Snyder
said:

“These boys did an outstanding
rescue job for which our crew is
most grateful. I’m sure they were
responsible for saving Mr. Black-
well’s life....

“We are proud to have such boys
in our community.”

Blackwell came out of the inci-
dent with a broken leg. He might
have lost his life had not the stu-
dents stopped to talk within hear-
ing distance of the 100-foot cliff
where he was hanging.

 

Caps And Gowns

Caps and gowns will be in the
Student Union basement tomorrow
; from 11:30 to 5:30. They must be
returned June 8. Graduation invita-
' tions are available at the Co- -op.

 

Though this was his first artistic
|endeavor, Captain Kable’s efforts
| pleased the college authorities suf-
| ficiently to warrant payment of $100.

Many patrons of the college
| thought the fee extravagant since
the replica did not closely resemble

Washington. The C Captain was heard
to answer his critics, “Well, I ain't
never seen George in person!”

There are several interesting
| Stories which have grown up over
ithe statue. One has it that the
| Union Army was dissauded from
burning the school at the sight of
| the father of their country. This is
|reputed, however, by Lexington
folk who maintain that the Yankees
mistook George for Jefferson Davis,
and were thoroughly intending on
razing the school when the town
| lovelies rushed to the rescue.

* This move, the first change in the
W&L political situation in several
years, gives the University Party
eleven houses with the remaining
seven in the Independent Party.
Also, the addition of SPE’s fifty votes
gives the University Party a major-
ity in the student body.

In an interview last night, Burke
explained that the University Party
was approached and learned of the
desire of SPE to become affiliated
with the University Party. A “party
clique” was called to consider the
position of SPE in the Independent
Party and our own position, Burke
stated.

At this meeting Warren Mills, SPE
political chairman, appeared before
the UP houses and explained why
SPE was desirous of becoming a
member of the University Party.

After deliberation the UP houses
voted unanimously to accept the
SPE chapter on equal terms with the
other houses in the party.

‘Unfair Treatment’

Warren Mills stated last night,
“During SPE’s membership in the
Independent Party, we realized that
the party is dominated by certain
houses, which did not provide for
fair and equal treatment of the fra-
ternities in the party.” He also
stated that realizing the situation,
the house decided to explore the
possibility of becoming affiliated with
the University Party. In his words,
“We felt that in the University Par-
ty our house as well as the other
houses will be accorded equal traeat-
ment.”

SPE house president Jack Cover
stated, “I, as well as the rest of the
house, was pleased upon learning
that the University Party had ap-
proved our becoming affiliated with
them.” Cover also expressed his
confidence in the mutual desires of
SPE and the University Party to
improve the political situation on
the W&L campus by consistently
putting up candidates of the highest
caliber regardless of house affilia-
tion,

Burke Cites Leadership

Speaking on behalf of the Uni-
versity Party, Burke stated, “We
were pleased to welcome the SPE’s
into the University Party. The SPE’s,
in the three years that they have
been on the W&L campus, have
contributed much to the University
and have displayed proved leader-
ship.

“I believe that this move will be
beneficial to the University, and the
University Party will continue in
the future to nominate the most
qualified men for political offices.”

This move greatly strengthens the
position of the University Party on
campus both in votes taken by
houses and in student body and class
elections.

The addition of the SPE’s fresh-
man class of 22 gives the University
Party a definite majority in that
class, which they failed to carry in
the recent class elections.

Peaceful Solution

Things were apparently settled at
a local pub, and the men were con-
tent with merely throwing tomatoes
and snuff cans at the dubious like-
ness.

The statue has a history of paint
over its pine log finish. VMI on
numerous occasions has adorned it
with its red and yellow and Frosh

cation of a fresh coat of blue.

George Well Preserved

“Old George” is a landmark for
Lexington and the University, as he
surveys all situations from his en-
vious position. Undoubtedly, the rep-
lica has mellowed somewhat with
advancing age, but as a painter re-
marked not too many summers ago,
| “The old boy is just well-perserved.”

Political System Falls
To New Depths

Washington and Lee’s already maligned political system has
now taken another turn for the worse. The SPE’s decision to
change political parties now throws the political balance even

more out of proportion.

The wisdom of this move is highly questionable. The
SPE’s contend that they were not getting a “fair shake” in the

Independent Party. However,

reason for the switch. It may be noted that that house has won
two positions in the freshman class in the recent class elections.
This is more than some of the houses in the University Party.
What is necessary to satisfy them?

No matter what the reasons, the move has been made.
There is no longer any semblance of a political balance. Poli-
tics at Washington and Lee will soon come to look even more
like the politics of the state. The contest will be decided in the

clique meetings.

This is not the way a political system should function.
There can be no real contest when one party contains a large
majority even before the ballots are cast. This could have
serious and detrimental consequences.

If we are not careful, the so called “gravy train” could
wreck the whole system of student government. With condi-
tions being what they are, it would take only one or two mis-
placed political candidates to seriously injure the already pre-
carious position of student government.

It will be interesting to note the final outcome of this
switch. This may be only the beginning of a major shake up
of politics at W&L. With new members in a party, here will
be less plums to be passed out. This could result in some hungry
and dissatisfied houses which could easily bring about further

this can hardly be the full

 

Opinions Vary On Academic
Opportunities W&L Offers

Brown Protests Against Apathy

To the Editor:

We are all aware that many of
the ablest among our Freshmen and
Sophomores are leaving us_ for
greener pastures. But that is accept-
ed as a matter of fact and few
seem to really care.

The fact is that there is something
dreadfully worng.

The deviate, the maverick is lost
here. He can hope to be nothing
more than an anonymous integer
in a data processing mechanism
which ignores identity and concen-
trates on an incomprehensible sta-
tistical norm. We are examined,
tested, retested, observed, checked,
cross-checked, filed and cross-filed.
But we are not educated.

Education
The educational process here, as
elsewhere, has become a ritualistic
and reflex enterprise. And to this
static and wholly confining ritual the
creative student is sacrificed. The
individual factor is ignored—the
yearning for growth and expansive

experimentation denied.

We live on a treadmill, afraid to
stay on, afraid to get olf.

Our goals are obscurred, our
standards obliterated. Education it-
self has become an accidental by-
product in the race for ratings. The
yardstick has become an end in
itself!

Fear, intimidation, frustration,
and panic—these are the products
of minds crushed and subverted to
a mechanical starndard which is
all too neat and all too untrue

it is true nonetheless. Ever since

He really is a good guy and I like
him a lot, so that is why everything
is so bad. But to get to the point, I
just had to write you and thank
you for that wonderful night that
we had together when I was up
in Lexington. You are such a won-
derful person and such a perfect
GENTLEMAN, that I just had to
write you and tell you how much
I was impressed with you and with

Anyhow, I want to thank you

walk over it, because I sure have
been thinking about you a WHOLE
LOT.

And another thing that I want
to compliment you on is the fact
that you are such a gentleman.
Who else but a gentleman would
have remembered that his house-
mother was a light sleeper and not
wanted us to go up the front

cape sure was a NEAT thing to
do. I was really impressed with

Notices

There will be a short meeting
of this year’s and next year’s busi-
ness staff of the Ring-tum Phi in
the Student Union at 7:00 tonight.

Due to final examinations, this is
the last edition of the Ring-tum Phi
that will come out until the Finals

know it. But we can not get away
from it and we know that also.

Observed
We are observed, and tend to ob-
serve ourselves, in fragments but
never for what we are in full. We
are conditioned for a life-time of
testing but never to locate ourselves
by our own standards.
This is human pigeon-holing run
amuck!
In the race for superior ratings
we must conform or fail. Conse-
quently, we learn to accept things at
their face value and we rarely ques-

 

tion. We deal in stereotypes and

general poor quality of, the profes-
sors. After having completed almost
two years at W&L, I have come to
change my former opinion as to the
merit of this University. Too many
of us I am afraid, rely too much
upon other people for our own in-
tellectual stimulation.

In expressing what W&L means to
me, I would use these two words:
FREEDOM and OPPORTUNITY.
The student here has great FREE-
DOM—all that is actually required
of him is class attendance, and even
this is not required of students hav-
ing B averages. The Honor System
provides the greatest freedom of
all—there is no illegal competition
from students doing dishonest work:

 

 

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

 

must live behind their masks. We
settle for the status-quo so that our
ratings will not be desolated. and yet
we know, deep within us, that su-
perior rating is not always the pro-
duct of superior performance.

The interchange of ideas, long
hours spent in animated debate
deep into the night, the vast ad-
venture of a new discovery about
self and the world about us, the
growth of the mind, are all lost
in the rat-race for an artificial,
impersonal, and new meaningless
rating.

Motivation

Motivation is not the problem. We
are motivated as no other genera-
tion has ever been. But we are de-
nied the chance to follow the chan-
nels into which the motivating forces
lead us.

The fault is not entirely ours nor
are we entirely guiltless.

But the tragedy is that those
who leave these halis may find
that the problem which they
sought to escape has preceded or
followed them. It is not Washing-
ton and Lee’s alone.

Anachronism
The anachronism is to some ex-
tent universal. Our educational fa-
cilities are all too often out of joint
with the age in which we live.
Duplication and feed-back is pri-
mary. We are parrots. Creative
learning is dead.
Respectfully,

BEN JARRATT BROWN

Rider Speaks
Dear Sir:

Several letters have been publish-
ed during the past few weeks in
the Ring-tum Phi concerning the
lack of intellectual challenge at

Washington and Lee. W&L has been
described as a “high school” and as

writers of these articles plan not to
return to the University in the fall.

Earlier this year, I, too, wrote a
letter criticizing W&L for its poor
classroom environment and for the

being “anti-intellectual.” Some of the | &

a student’s grade point ratio rep-
resents entirely his own honest ef-
forts. The OPPORTUNITY is present
in the liberal degree requirements,
in the small classroom environment,
in the personal contact which a stu-
dent can have with his professors,
and in the great amount of time
present beyond the regular class
meeting hours.

This great freedom is a difficult
thing to cope with—the individual
student is not led by the hand and
shown how he should spend _ his
time or told how to plan his stu-
dies. The student must himself de-
cide how much time to spend in
studying, what to study, and how
best to digest the material. Perhaps
the majority of the students here
may be described as “anti-intellec-
tual” and are in fact too social-
centered, but there are many fine
hardworking men on this campus
who are seeking a firm academic
background. Wherever a person goes,
it may well be that his own interest

Last Word;
Praises WGEL

By HOWARD SLATER
Friday Columnist

The little row we've been hav-
ing among ourselves about boys
leaving and boys staying is a wel-
come interruption to the usual rou-
tine of nothingness in which we
tend to exist. If nothing else, people
have shown that they care about
something—whether it is the school,
intoxication, or good-clean-fellow-
ship. Concern, even if it is no more
than a distaste for beards, is far
preferable to vibrant indifference.

Let me get a few thing straight,
however. First I do not at all re-
sent being likened to Moses; he
seems to have been a pretty good
sort. Second, the column I wrote
which provoked so many indignant
responses was not essentially about
“beer”—it was about concern, about
people caring, especially we here
at Washington and Lee. This has
been the only true theme in the
articles I have written all year
long. And with all the disagreeable
things that have been said, it is in-
teresting to see that the response of
people caring only occurred when
the ostensible issue of “beer” was
raised.

If this is the sore-spot which will
provoke the student body, then it
was worth writing an admittedly
exaggerated article to stir things
up. If beer rallies really do fur-
ther closer human relations between
students, and if those who say that
they do sincerely believe this, ther
let us all subscribe to the belief. It
is a worthy value. Those who are
willing to stand by the value of
closer relations deserve more credit
than those who would simply poke
fun at our little comic debate. (Only,
please, let’s steer clear of beards;
they should not be an issue here.)

The problem with this accommo-
dating approach is that those who
say “You can go; we're satisfied;
we'll stay at the Paramount,” aren’t
really concerned at all. They don’t
care, because if they did, they
would be forced to admit that not
everything is hunkey-dory. This
they do not seem willing to do.

But it would be a shame not to
make the last word one of praise,
as well as dissatisfaction. This is a
fine school, and we cannot have not
gained a great deal from it. Best of
all, improvements are coming at a
heartening rate. While we say, truth-
fully, that our professors are not
perfect, and that there is much room

Virginia Routs Stickmen By 14-3 Score

McDaniel And Gummey Score;
Final Game Of The Season

By AL JOHNSTON

The Washington and Lee Lacrosse
team lost it final game of the season
to the University of Virginia 14-3,
here Saturday.

Hy Lavaseur led the scoring for
the Cavaliers with 4 goals and John
McDaniel was credited with two
of the Generals’ goals.

The score was 4-1 at halftime,
W&L having given the favored Vir-
ginia team a rough battle.

Leading 8-3 going into the last
period U. Va. broke the game wide
open with four consecutive goals
within a three-minute span, Lav-

Weak Hitting
Poor Effort Is
Team’s Trouble

By CHUCK LANE

When the 1961 baseball team
finished with an 8-4 record, every-
one looked forward to the 1962
season as the probable height of
W&L baseball fortunes.

There were lettermen returning
at every position, the pitching staff
was experienced, and a new crop
of freshmen were to add invaluable
bench strength. However, on the
spring trip, weak pitching and spot-
ty hitting caused the Generals to
return with a 1-4 record.

This trend continued through the
year when several individuals
turned in brilliant performances at
times, but there was no sustained
effort by the entire team. Robin
Wood led the W&L nine to their
best performance of the year de-
feating William and Mary, 9-6,
avenging an earlier loss.

Captain Ned Hobbs and Park Gil-
more anchored the infield corps and
Bob Williams and Robin Wood did
excellent service in the outfield.
Jim Russ and Ashley Allen came
into their own behind the plate in
the latter part of the season and
cut down several attempts at steal-
ing second which had plagued the
team earlier.

Mason MecGowin, Phil Sharp, Lou
Paterno, Chris Wigert and Brice
Gamber all came on strong near
the end of the season, but the hitters
could not manage to push across the
necessary runs at crucial times, and
consequently several games were
lost my small margins.

Next year, W&L will have eight
lettermen returning but will have
to fill several positions in both the
infield and outfield left vacant by
graduation.

 

Several new teams have been add-
ed to the schedule, including the
Univ. of Vermont, Camp Lejune
Marines, Univ. of Connecticut, aad

aseur led the drive himself by
scoring two of the goals.

W&L’'s goalie Ray Miller found
it rough going having made 13 saves
in the first period alone and ending
with 25.

Deeley Nice, Virginia’s standout
goalie, was not quite as busy as
Miller having but nine saves before
going out in the first half.

Other leading scorers for the Cal-
valiers were McGill and Davies, both
having thrown in two.

The last General score of the
game was registered by Charlie
Gummey who seemed to have a
hard time finding his aim earlier
in the contest.

The hostility between W&L and
the Cavaliers seems to have mani-
fested itself Saturday as the Uni-
versity of Virginia amassed a total
of 14 personal fouls to the Generals’
three.

Coach McHenry’s team ended the
season with one win and 11 losses.

Although such senior standouts
as captain Bart Michell, All-South
goalie Ray Miller and defense-
man Bill Wheeler will be absent
next season, McHenry feels that
he has enough ability in this year’s
freshman and junior class to carry
the team through a more success-
ful season next spring.

Charlie Gummey, Bob Van
Rensselaer, and Dan Reed are the

 

 

Co-captains-elect for the ’63 season.

Coach McHenry’s Forces
End Year With 1-11 Slate

After dropping a 14-3 decision to
the University of Virginia here,
Saturday, the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team wound up with an
unimpressive season record of 1-11.

Lack Experience

The lacrosse team began the sea-
son with a decisive handicap as ten
of the twenty men on the squad
were freshmen. Coach McHenry
feels that this was a great setback
since many of these more unex-
perienced players had to be used
against well-developed “machines”
such as Baltimore University and
Johns Hopkins.

McHenry said that there were
only six strong players on the
team. Ray Miller should be highly
praised for the adjustment he
made after switching from crease
attack to goalie. Miller leads the
nation in saves and has been chos-
en as the South’s goal tender in
the North-South game to be play-
ed at Rutgers, June 9.

At defense, Bob Van Rensselaer
and Bart Mitchell did exceptional
jobs. Mitchell scored twice this sea-
son which is unusual for a defense-
man,

John McDaniel

John McDaniel and Charlie Gum-
mey were outstanding for the Gen-
erals offensively as they were first

 

and second respectively in scoring
for the squad. Gummey also must
be credited for controlling most of
the face-offs this season.

Coach McHenry

Coach McHenry feels that the
team’s best effort was its 15-4 de-
feat at the hands of Johns Hop-
kins. He said, though, that the high-
light of the season was the Gen-
erals lone victory over UNC, who
they whipped 9-4,

Many of the games this season
were relatively close and Mce-
Henry feels that with a few
breaks, several of these could have
gone either way. He cited es-
pecially the 6-5 loss to Washington
College and the 6-3 defeat at the
hand of Hofstra.

Next year the lacrosse team will
be losing only two lettermen so,
with some new talent and the ex-
perience gained by this year’s young
squad, Coach McHenry is rather op-
timistic that the 1963 season will
prove to be a more successful one.

 

Notice

The annual sports barbecue will
be held as scheduled at Coach Mc-
Laughlin’s camp tomorrow. All
sports awards, trophies and mono-
grams will be presented to team
members.

 

Soccer Team Selves Alsunei. 5-1

By PETE ALFORD

The varsity soccer team won 5-1
over an aggregate of aging alumni
and aspiring second stringers last
Friday after a week of spring soc-
cer practice.

Coach Joe Lyles’ regulars, using
new line formation, pumped in three
goals in the first half and two in
the last half to secure the win.
Dave Knight, former W&L cap-
tain tallied in the final minutes
for the only alumni score.

Sophomore Charlie Sweet with
three goals and Jim Melfi, who
put in two, accounted for the
Generals’ scoring.

Joining these two on the line are

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Supon Hits
Letter Writers

It seems from the letters and ar-
ticles which have been appearing in
the Ring-tum Phi during the last
couple of weeks that the Bearded
Prophet is rapidly turning into
Lexington’s answer to Moses, lead-
ing the dissatisfied student body
away to a promised land.

I am certain that Mr. Slater and
Mr. Walker could find a_ school
somewhere at which “the Hill” is
in complete control of all activities,
in which there is no such thing as
a beer rally, and in which there is a
great emphasis upon academics with
no social life at all.

However, if anyone believes that
academics are supposed to be the
main part of life at W&L, he is
obviously sadly mistaken. One of the
avowed purposes of the University
is to prepare students for all facets
of a successful life—a life which
needs social training as well as that
to be found in books and classrooms.

But, since these two gentlemen
seem so set upon leaving, then let
them. And I sincerely hope that they
find their Valhalla for Angry Young
Men somewhere.

Sincerely,
WILLIAM SU?PON

Coach Lyles said that he was im-
pressed by the speed of the line
and was happy that the team could
get in the week of spring practice.
The team will report for early on the
13th of September. Their first game
is with Pfeiffer College on the
27th of that month.

group will be in the minority—his
own values and motivations should
not stem from what the majority
holds to be good. Ultimately, each
man must stand alone and be able
to work and act out of consideration
for his own motives and interests.
There exists at W&L the oppor-
tunity for an excellent education—
it is primarily up to each student to
make the most of this oppurtunily.
Granted that there are some profes-
sors who are not doing their best in
the classroom—but there are also a
good number of stimulating teachers
who are competent and dedicated.
Washington and Lee is by no means
a perfect institution, but there are
many men, both students and faculty,
who are seeking to improve the
University and to make it an even
finer place for academic endeavor.
Each student has the responsibility
of accepting the great—and diffi-
cult—freedom and opportunity pres-
ent for education at Washington
and Lee.

for improvement, still we ought ‘o
acknowledge that they have helped
us greatly, do have concern for us,
and do make the effort to improve.
The ultimate dissatisfaction must
come, therefore, from our own fail-
ure to grasp and utilize the oppor-
tunities we have been given. It is
inevitable that we should fail in
some measure in achieving this goal.
To the extent that we have suc-
ceeded, that much should we rejoice.
(By this qualification, I hope that
you have been saved from a year-
bookish eulogy.) But to the extent
that we concede our failure, in this
we will have also succeeded; and
since college is just a beginning—
of academic knowledge as well as
other kinds of lessons—then this
will be the best part of it all.

Georgetown. W&L will also play
host to the tournament of the newly

composed of Sewanee, Centre,
Southwestern, and W&L.

Coach Lyles lists his primary
needs for next year as a right
handed pitcher, two catchers, and
two or three outfielders to compen-
sate for the loss of seven seniors.
He says that the amount of husile
displayed by the younger members
will make up for the loss of ex-
perienced men, and should give
W&L a successful season in 63.
