IFC Votes
On Rush

The Interfraternity Council took
the first big step toward changing
the W&L fraternity rush procedure
last night when it voted in favor of
the four-week delayed system, 13-4.

The proposed change will be voted
upon again next week when another
two-thirds approval would make the
change a part of the IFC constitu-
tion, pending approval of the faculty.

The only modification made in the
proposed system was an amendment
proposed by Ross Kyger which left
the question of contact between fra-
ternity men and freshmen to be set-
tled by the IFC. The move was made
when the question of dirty rush was
raised in regard to open house par-
ties during the no-rush four week
period at the beginning of school.

The houses opposing the rush
program were Lambda Chi, Pi Phi,
SPE and Beta. Apparently two of
these houses opposed the change per
se while the others objected to cer-
tain of the stipulations included in
the committee report.

Bob Doenges, IFC president, and
George Honts, the committee chair-
man, both expressed their apprecia-
tion of the IFC action last night and
reaffirmed their belief in the pro-
posed system to this reporter.

The vote next week will be fol-
lowed by elections of IFC officers
for the coming year.

EC Kills Honor
System M ectings

In a brief post election meeting
last night, the Executive Committee
discussed and voted down a pro-
posal that would have placed the
Honor System before the student
body this year for a reaffirmation of
faith.

The measure called for a general
university assembly at which time
the the student body would have
been called upon to reaffirm its be-
lief in the intrinise values of the
Honor System. The Committee re-
jected the move because it felt the
remainder of the year did not allow
sufficient time to prepare and be-
cause this move might prove cum-
bersome to the incoming EC.

A heated debate followed on
whether or not the present EC
should recommend this action to
future committees. No action was
taken on this proposal.

Several committeemen felt the

Honor System was too much a basic
part of this University’s meaning to
be subjected to the vote of a single
generation of students. Others said
that a reaffirmation of one’s faith is
necessary in any system.

The committee also announced last
night that they had passed a recom-
mendation to next year’s EC call-
ing for a “bill of rights” to be in-
cluded in the student body constitu- |
tion. This would see that the Honor |

Is Performance

Noted Musician Selected
To Play At Finals Concert

Fats Domino, one of the great exponents of Rock ’n Roll,
has been signed to perform for this year’s Finals Concert to
be held on Tuesday, June 5, 1962, Steve Galef, President of
the Dance Board, announced today.

Domino, who has sold over
three years, has scored hits with his*
versions of “My Blue Heaven,”
“When My  Dreamboat Comes
Home,” and “Blueberry Hill.”

Fats has often been hailed as one
of the modern music greats. When
asked about the popularity of the
new musical craze of Rock ’n Roll,
Fats explains: “There’s nothing real-
ly new about the music. I’ve been
doing it ever since I can remember,
only we: know it as rhythm and
blues. Actually, it started in New
Orleans fifteen years ago. It comes
straight out of Dixieland Jazz and
has the same beat.”

Composed Own Hits
Many of Fats’ greatest successes
have been with tunes that he com-
posed. They might best be described
as folk songs with a rhythm and

Fletcher Speaks

At Seminar

Dr. Joseph Fletcher will ap-
pear at 7:30 tonight in Lee
Chapel under the joint spon-
sorship of the University Chris-
tian Association and the De-
partment of Religion.

The topic of Dr. Fletcher’s dis-
cussion this evening will be
“Christian Ethics and Nuclear Wea-
pons.” Dr. Fletcher has done ex-
tensive traveling for the purpose of
speaking on this topic.

The attitude with which Dr.
Fletcher approaches his topic should
be of especial interest to the mem-
bers of the School of Commerce and
Business Administration, in that Dr.
Fletcher is currently a member of
the teaching staff of the Harvard
School of Business.

Dr. Fletcher is also Professor of
Christian Social Ethics at the Epis-
copal Theological Seminary in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts.

Dr. Fletcher is President of the
Human Betterment Association of
America, a member of the Board of
the Massachusetts Planned Parent-
hood League, and a member of the
governmental Business Ethical Ad-
visory Council. He is the author of

 

three books: The Church and In-
dustry, Christianity and Property,
and Morals and Medicine.

Dr. Fletcher received the A.B.

degree from the University of West
Virginia, the B.D. degree from the
Berkerley Divinity School, and the
S.T.D. at Kenyon College. He has
been at the Episcopal
Seminary since 1944,

night’s seminar is composed of Dr.

blues beat. Like all folk songs, the
important thing for Fats is that they
all tell a story. He gets his titles
from colloquial expressions that
have become a part of everyday
speech, like “Ain’t That a Shame?”
“Poor Me,” and “I’m in Love Again.”
As he puts it: “I write tunes about
what people say. Whatever you say,
if it sounds catchy, I put it in a
tune. Sometimes I'll be talking to a
friend, and he’ll say some thing that
sounds good, so I'll call out, ‘Put that
down, it’s a song’.”

An entertainer like Fats doesn’t
just “happen.” His talent is the
result of a lifetime of hard work
and application. He was born An-
toine Domino on February 26,
1928, in New Orleans. Although he
was the only one of nine children
to show an interest in music, the
family was not an unmusical one.
His father was a violinist and his
uncle, Harry Verett, had played
with such famous Jazz aggrega-
tions as those of Kid Ory and
Oscar Celestine.

Fats first displayed his musicai
precosity when he was barely out
of short-pants. One of his cousins
left an old upright piano with the
family. The youngster was fascinated
by the instrument and, in no time,
he was able to pick out simple melo-
dies on it.

Singing at Ten

By the time Fats was ten vears
old, he was playing and singing for
pennies in the local Honky Tonks.
Unfortunately, this early career as a
cabaret entertiner was shortlived.
When he was old enough to get a
proper job, he had to go to work
in a bedspring factory to help sup-
port his family. His daily chores at
manual labor did not deter him from
his ambition to become a musician.

Fats rapidly developed into a
musician’s musician. All of the
players in town got into the habit
of dropping in to hear him beat
out those rhythm and blues. It was
because of his popularity with his
fellow artists that Lew Chud,
president of Imperial Records,
first heard him. On a talent-scout-
ing trip to New Orleans, he heard
nothing but great things about a
new musician named Fats Domino,
so he went out to the roadhouse
to listen for himself, After a few
numbers he knew tht all the talk
about the pianist-singer had not
been exaggerated and immediately
signed him to a recording contract.
At 29, Fats Domino has managed to

become one of the top artists in his
field. He still makes his home in
New Orleans. He is happily married
and the father of six children. His
five-year-old son is

something of

The results of last night’s

Committeeman show that there is still a degree of sensibility left

in the Student Body.

It seems that the Student Body finally opened their eyes
and cast party politics aside for their own best interests. For
the most part, the elections were based upon what they should
be—qualifications and not party interests. This resulted in the
election of a qualified and capable Executive Committee.

Albee’s Plays Emphasize Strongly
The Hollowness Of American Life

In its final production of the sea-
son, the Troubadour Theater will
present Edward Albee’s two plays
“The American Dream” and “The
Zoo Story,” beginning Wednesday,
May 9, at 8:30 p.m.

The plays will be running through
Saturday, May 12 and reservations
must be made beforehand, Dr. Cecil
Jones, director of the production, an-
nounced,

The two plays, each one hour in
length, portray two rather different
tones. “The American Dream” is de-
scribed by Dr. Jones as “a comedy
with serious intent, exposing the
vapidness and lack of any real values
in the average American life.”

“The Zoo Story,” on the other
hand, is a more serious and in some
ways more realistic piece. With its
setting in Central Park, New York,
the play concerns a man seeking to
lead a rather ordered, well-regu-
lated, and relatively empty existence.
The drama is triggered off when he
is confronted by another man who
recognizes that this sort of life is
futile and unproductive.

The five-member cast of “The
American Dream” features three fe-
male parts. “Mommy” is played by
Mrs. Anne Emmons, who is making
her debut on the Troubadour Thea-
ter and is the wife of Dr. Lyman
Emmons of the W&L Biology De-
partment.

 

Election May Day Will Add Meaning
To ‘Important’ Spring Class Elections

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

I spent this past wekend basking
in the sun at one of the finer neigh-
boring girls’ schools in celebration of
the rites of spring, and while watch-
ing all of the lovely girls cavort
around a great big May pole several
ideas passed through my head in
rapid succession. One of the least in-
teresting of these random thoughts
was the question of why W&L prob-
ably dosen’t have a May Day cele-
bration.

After thinking about that for a
while

sure you'll agree that
there isn’t a very

I'm

good answer. Of
course we have
Spring Dances,

and there are in-
dividual forays in-
. to the hills to wel-
come the arrival
of Dionysius back
on the scene, but
there really isn’t
a formal apprecia-
tion and pianned
ceremony here at

   

Craven
W&L.

On first considering the problem
of staging such a show here, I
thought it might be impossibie.
There are, of course, all sorts of
scurrilous implications which could
be made about May Day at a men’s
school. But after watching the pro-
gram at the girls’ school for a
while I saw that this didn’i bother
them at all. As a maiter of fact,
they sort of played it up; so with

of good breeding, I think we can
throw one on here.

About the toughest difficulty to
surmount in staging a May Day here
at W&L will not be finding partici-
pants, but rather when to schedule
the thing. We all know, naturally,
that May Day must by rights come
in May, and we all know what a
jam-packed, fun-filled month May
is already. So we'll either have to
eliminate something that already
exists, or force a combination. Elim-
ination is obviously out as an answer,
because we should know by now that
if something already exists then there
must have been a reason for it, and
so it is going against tradition to
abolish it. So I recommend some sort
of combination of a W&L May Day
with an already established ritual.

Probably the  best-established
ritual here on campus is the stu-
dent election. Fortunately this
comes in May, and so we've al-
ready got the machinery which can
be readily adapted to fit a May
Day celebration. Now the Big
Seven officers are pretty busy
without having further duties
foisted off on them, and _ besides,
Big Seven officers shouldn't be
elected on looks alone. Therefore
the place to go is class elections.
If these can be molded to fit a
May Day format our lives will he
doubly enriched come Election
May Day (which is as good a name
as any, and one I propose for adop-
tion).

With the celebration of Election
May Day W&L will reap many

 

taste and tact and loss of displays

to class offices. In the first place,
the historian of each class will finally
have something to write about. This
in itself justifies the whole thing.
In the next place, the more re-
sponsible class offices of president.
vice president and secretary will have
something to talk about at class
meetings. Instead of having to in-
vent business (“We're gathered here
today to discuss the role of the jun-
ior class in the modern world...”),
these men will have to formulate
definite plans and make responsible
decisions (“O.K., you guys, today

May pole should be set up. Are we
going to have it on the front lawn
in view of any stray tourist, or will
we put it over at VMI and blame it
on them?”).

The biggest advantage of insti-
tuting a May Day to coincide with
class elections, however, will be
that students will finally be com-
pelled (and self-compelled, at
that) to get to know the candi-
dates. The posters on campus will
finally be looked at with a dis-
criminating eye as students have
real issues (Aquiline features vs.
All-American boy type look) to
choose between. This will bring
W&L politics out of the ivory
tower of the clique meeting and
back to the level of the people.
It can’t happen soon enough.

Long live the May Queen of W&L,
and may he lead the Senior Class
to glory forever. The three vice
presidents, of course, will form the

“Grandma” is played by Mrs. Ruth
Browne, housemother of PiK.A, who
starred in the recent production of
“Don Juan.” “Mrs, Barker” is por-
trayed by Josephine Unger, head
of the art department of Southern
Seminary, who is making her third
appearance in the Troubadour Thea-
ter.

Playing the two male parts are
Nick Denton, a Phi Psi junior, who
as “The Young Man” is making his
first appearance on the Troubadour
stage, and Andy Adelson, a junior,
portraying “Daddy.”

In “The American Dream,” Albee
is writing of a typical American
family who have formed a rather
meaningless interrelationship in
which all feeling is dulled by an
inane dialogue.

The only strong character in the
play is “Grandma,” who serves as
the connecting link for the other
four characters. She alone has some
glimpse into the absurdity of the
family’s ethos.

“Daddy” is acquiescent, shallow,
and unthinking. “Mommy” is the
same way, and comes out as a wo-
man completely infatuated with hats,
clubs, and “society.”

“Mrs. Barker” is somewhat of an
appendage to the family, impulsive-
ly getting involved in everyone's af-
fairs but her own.

“The Young Man” represents the
American dream” incarnate with his
dashing Hollywood appearance. Yet
in actuality, he has only his physical
beauty, which can not make up for
the void in his heart and soul.

Only Absolute Madness Could Prompt Someone
To Attend A Local School's May Day Celebration

By SANDY FENN

Brother! I’m just a fool, that’s
what I am. I’m a miserable victim
_ of circumstances,
* a completely
trampled down
specimen of hu-
» manity, an utterly
heart-broken and
disillusioned indi-

vidual. Unfortu-
nately I can’t
complain that I

wasn’t warned,
because I was.

Six of my most
faithful friends
even brought me a fifth of scotch
last Wednesday and got me loaded
in an attempt to talk me out of my
madness. They told me that terrible
things had happened before... but
even in my drunken stupor I raved,
I accused them of being traitors to
the cause of friendship and brother-
hood, and I smashed my empty fifth
over the head of my roommate. I
refused to admit the clear light of
reason and practical experience—and
I went to May Day.

Why I did it, Pll never really
know. I must have been nuts. No
sane masculine animal with the LQ.
of an Orangutan would have done
a thing like that—but I did it. Late
Saturday morning I jumped into my
1952 Kaiser and started off «without

even questioning the sanity cf my
actions.

Now I thought this May Day pro-
gram was some sort of a modern
Nature festival... what was all this
about a formal dance? I had en-
visioned an invigorating, barefoot
romp through the sunny fields with
my beautiful date—you know Cor-
rina’s going a-Maying and all that
sort of thing...Instead I find my-
self on the way back to Lexington
to get my dinner jacket, which I
had forgotten.

Nevertheless, I returned in time to
see most of the festivities. First the
choir sang, then there were speeches
on the lawn, then the choir sang
again, then the girls danced around
the Maypole, then the choir sang
again, and then I passed out at the
feet of the Dean of Students.

The school doctor argued that I
was in a state of intoxication, but
my rebuttal was that I had suffered
a heat stroke while standing in the
sun listening to the blasted choir
for two hours.

As the sun dipped low in the
West, I was released from ine in-
firmary and rejoined my cate for a
sumptuous repast of raw fried chick-
en, soggy potato salad, and squashej
cup cakes.

The formal dance that night was
a huge success...my beautiful date

his best comebacks to whip Fleish-
man.

Fleishman cut Robrecht’s eye in
the first round and almost scored a
TKO, but Robrecht hung on and
pounded Fleishman into submission
in the second round.

The fight was stopped after Ro-
brecht began to hit Fleishman at will.

Since entering law school, Robrecht
has had 11 fights, including Marine
Corps opposition.

‘I'm proud of having four vic-|
tories of Marine opposition,” Ro-|
brecht said. “You know, those Ma-
rine boys are usually considered
pretty tough.”

Robrecht has conquered three Ma- |

rines from Quantico and one from}

Camp LeJeune.

However, he still
two bouts against
spring as his toughest.

In addition to his Golden Gloves
victory, Robrecht scored a unani-
mous decision over Tomblin at the
Lexington Sports Show.

“Tomblin (The Eastern Virginia
champ) is a good fighter. I learned
a lot in experience and style in my
fights with him,”

One question that Robrecht is
always asked is “How did you keep
in shape?”

his
this

considers
Tomblin

Robrecht answers this easily.

He keeps in shape by doing two

| and a half miles of road work each
|} morning, and an hour of work

in
the gym in the afternoon, plus spar-
ring when he can find an opponent.

“My big problem here is the lack
of sparring partners,” Robrecht said.
“To keep in good shape you have
to have a great deal of sparring. I

just haven't been able to get
enough,”
After six years of hard work,

Robrecht has fought his way to the
top. Now he is retiring; retiring as
the amateur middleweight champion
of Virginia.

Thus ends the spectacular career
of Ray Robrecht, the Washington
and Lee one-man boxing team.

Walker Denounces W&L;
Labels It ‘High School’

Editor:

Having been subjected to a barrage
of outraged illogic which has ap-
peared in this paper over the past
few weeks, I would like to take this
opportunity to support the faculty
in their recent actions. In fact,, I
not only commend them for their
recent actions, but I encourage them
to take more action along these lines.

Sudents have been screaming late-
ly that the Hill is anti-fraternity,
and that they are encroaching on
student freedom. The example of this
was George Honts’ article in the
April 24 issue of the R-t P. I would
like to remind Mr. Honts and other
students that the University exists
for the benefit of the students, and
the students do not exist for the
benefit of the institution. Hence,
the Administration has the right to
take any action that it deems neces-

sary. It has given the students a
great deal of freedom in certain

areas, and this is laudable. However,
the Administration has the right to
deprive the students of that free-
dom whenever they feel that the
students have abused it or have
shown themselves ineapable of using
it responsibly.

I agree with the faculty members
who stated that only the faculty
can judge what best for the
university. At present the students
are incapable of making such an
judgment. The students
are committed to defending and pre-

Baltimore College Defeats
Hapless Stickmen, 19-6;
Generals Ninth Loss

By NICK MONSARRAT
Staff Reporter

The University of Baltimore hand-
ed the Washington and Lee lacrosse
team their ninth loss in ten starts
Saturday, whipping the Generals
19-6

Combining a_ strong midfield
with an aggressive attack the
Bees charged into an early lead
with five goals in the first period
and followed in the second with
five more.

While the Generals were able to
control the face-offs under the
leadership of Charlie Gummey, it
was not enough to hold the Balti-
more attack. Team effort and good
individual performances by Balti-
more’s Stewart Harrison, Laverghet-
ta, and Price kept the attack on
W&L goalie Ray Miller continual,
putting the half-time score at 10-4.
Charlie Gummey and John McDan-
iel accounted for the W&L first half
scoring with two goals apiece.

With their comfortable lead, Bal-
timore replaced their regulars with
substitutes in the third quarter and
renewed their scoring with seven
goals. Lack of W&L team-work and
a good Baltimore defense led by
Laverghetta, kept the General at-
tack at a stand-still. The score going
into the final quarter stood at 17-4.

In the final period W&L was
forced to be satisfied with match-
ing the Baltimore scoring as Fres-
man Caroll Klingelhofer accounted

Lynchburg Falls
To W&L Golfers

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
golf team defeated Lynchburg
college 6 1/2-2 1/2 Monday
afternoon at the Bonnsboro

Country Club.

The Generals Jack Vardaman fired
a four over par 76 to take medalist
honors while tying his opponent in
match play.

Couch Loses

Also in the first foursome was
W&L’s Grantham Couch who lost to
the Hornet’s Jim O’Meara two up.

In the second foursome Ronnie
Stewart defeated Lynchburg’s John
Caldwell three up and Will Lee of
W&L easily overcame George John-
son.

Three Up

Steve Henry and Paul McBride
also defeated their Lynchburg op-
ponents, both finishing three holes
up.

The best ball in each foursome
ended in a tie in the first and third
groups, but W&L won in the second.

Final Match

This match marked the final con-
test of the season for the linkmen.
They posted a slate of five wins and
three losses.

Netmen Trounce Hapless Eagles;

Prepare To Face Tough Virginia

The Washington and Lee tennis
team trounced Bridgewater, 9-0, on
the home courts last Friday. The
generals, minus the services of their
two best players, Captain John Bak-
er and frosh Randy Jones, played
flawless tennis, refusing to give up
one set to the hapless Eagles from
Bridgewater.

In the first two singles posi-
tions, DeYoung and Mell won by
identical scores of 6-0, 6-1. Bud
Hollman, playing number three
shut out Dave Hersch of Bridge-
water.

Freshman Lindsey Short in the
number one four position had the
closest match of the day, beating
Gene Higgs 6-3, 7-5.

Howie Busse shut out his op-

 

ponent in the number five slot while
Steve Hibbard won easily, 6-1, 6-0,
at number six singles.

Doubles Victories

The Generals won the doubles in
short order, allowing Bridgewater
only two games in three matches.
DeYoung and Hollman beat Brown
and Aiken, 6-0, 6-1. Mell and Short
at number two doubles, and Busse

Trackmen Comments On Excuses

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Trackmen, as everybody knows,
don’s always win. And there are a
million reasons (according to the
runners themselves) why _ they
don’t—reasons which are sometimes
more interesting than the events
themselves.

Coach Lord has a collection of the
choice excuses handed down through
the years by athletes for their sub-
par performances. He calls this col-
lection his Handy Alibi Sheet, which
gives the athletes an opportunity to
select the best possible alibi for
any occasion.

Lord’s list provides for every-
thing. The athlete in need of an
alibi may have started his kick too
soon, may have started it voo late,
may have trained too little, or may

 

have overtrained. He may need
wheat oil germ, then again he may
need yogurt. His girl friend inay
have been unfriendly the night be-
fore the race, or (more than likely)
she was too friendly.

One of the most useful alibis in-
vented is: “I’m building up slowly
for four years from now.” Another
excuse for a less than desirable per-
formance on a particular day is, “I’m
saving myself for . (An
upcoming race, which actually means
a house party or Sem date).

The prima donna (every track-
man) will complain that his spikes
were too long or too short, that foot-
ing was too hard or too soft, or that
it was too warm or too cold. An
alibi just out is: “I don’t have red
shoes,” a reason for several races

The big problem for some ath-
letes is that they can’t run when
they’re ahead. Then there are ath-
letes who can’t run when they’re
behind. And there are athletes who
can’t run.

One topper in Lord’s collection is
“I wanted to see what the other
place medals were like.” And there
are runners who don’t force a race
because the medals are cheap, any-
way.

Other perfectly legitimate excuses
are: “I don’t like organized athlet-
ics” (the athlete discovers this after
his first competitive meet), I only

serving the existing order especiai-
ly in regard to fraternities. Oonly
the faculty can make an objective
decision in this area.
I have read repeatedly in this
newspaper that Washington and Lee
is one of the finest colleges in the
nation. Frankly, I feel that this is
a palpable lie. The students here are
dedicated to “having a good time,”
and are opposed to any innovation
which might make it harder to at-
tain this goal. When compared to
such colleges as Amherst, Oberlin,
and Swarthmore where intellectual-
ism is virulent, Washington and Lee
is nothing more than post-graduate
high school. For these reasons I too,
like Spud Slater and the anonymous
freshman whose letter appear last
week, am leaving next year for a
saner, more mature world.
Most sincerely,

Troubs Feature Albee’s Plays

(Continued from page 2)

“The Zoo Story” is contrasted to
“The American Dream” in that it is
not so much of a caricature as a
penetrating study of character. Once
again, the problem is that of inte-
communication.

“Peter,” portrayed by junior John
Dunnell, is a man of about 40, an
executive in a _ small publishing
house, a typical family man for the
upper middle class, a rigid conform-
ist, living always by the rule.

“Jerry,” played by junior Tim
Morton, is about 35, a non-conform-
ist who is bored with his isolation
from others, and above all obsessed
by the hope of achieving personal
contact with another.

Albee, the extremely promising
playwright of the two plays, has
been in Lexington since last Wednes-
day assisting in the production.
Visiting the campus in the capacity
of a Glasgow Professor, Mr. Albee
has been attending dress rehearsals
and offering helpful advice on ex-
plaining the overall concept of the
play as well as the performance of
the specific roles.

Albee was first brought into the
