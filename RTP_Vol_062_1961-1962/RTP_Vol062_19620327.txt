Christian Declines To Run For President

By TUESDAY STAFF WRITERS

The Tuesday Edition learned today that Meade Christian,
Phi Gam rising senior, who had been mentioned as the
leading Independent Party Candidate for the presidency of
the Student Body will not run in the April election.

Christian, who placed high in a sample poll which was
run in last Tuesday’s paper, stated that outside considera-
tions were the reasons for not wanting to run.

Christian stated in an interview today that “In con-
sideration of the sum total of other duties and responsi-
bilities that I have taken on for next year, I do not feel that
I can efficiently carry out these responsibilities along

Christian made it clear that this did not mean that he
would not be available to serve the student body in other
capacities. He stated: “While I realize that the office of Stu-
dent Body President may offer more opportunity for ser-
vice than any one of my other duties, I feel that the sum
total, if given the proper consideration, will permit me to
serve the University in a number of capacities. I do not want
to sacrifice these opportunities.”

Christian’s announcement could have a profound effect
upon the campus political situation. As the leading candidate

from the Independent

Campus comment on the issue met with serious replies.
Chairman of the Independent Party, Spud Slater, stated:
he is the most qualified and capable member of the Student

position. I personally hope that he
decides to run for the good of the

University and for the good of the party.”
University Party Chairman, Grantham Couth, was un-
available for comment.

IFC Passes Rule
On Combo Time

A resolution limiting the combos of fraternities on Friday
nights of dance set weekends officially was voted into the IFC
Constitution at last night’s regular meeting.

Passed last week for the first time, the resolution had to].

pass the fraternity group twice before it could become a part

of the IFC Constitution.

The proposal was submitted last
week by Ross Kyger, Kappa Sig
junior, and Tony Schlesinger, ZBT
junior.

The new rules are designed to
eliminate a large amount of con-
flict that exists between fraternity
combos and University sponsored
dance functions.

The only change made to the pro-
posals which was presented last
week was a clarification of the
“closed party” clause.

Not To Other Students

The IFC felt that “closed” meant
only to Washington and Lee stu-
dents, and not to students from oth-
er schools.

The proposal in effect states:

1, All fraternity combo parties
in conflict with University Spon-
sored dances on Friday nights of
dance weekends will be closed.
Closed is to be defined as mem-
bers of one fraternity only and
the party shall be held in the
house of that fraternity.

2. No fraternity may compel
one of its members to pay an ex-
tra social assessment for said com-
bo to be held in conflict ...if that

In duPont Hall

A professor of political science at
Johns Hopkins University will speak
tonight on “The Doldrums of Belief:
Our Land and Our Tradition.”

Dr. Carl B. Swisher, a former
president of the American Politi-
cal Science Association, will speak
in duPont Auditorium at 8:15 p.m.

Speaking under the sponsorship
of the University’s department of
political science and the University
Center in Virginia, Dr. Swisher is a
Thomas P. Stran professor at Johns
Hopkins.

Dr. Swisher is a former special
assistant to the Attorney General
of the United States.

member wishes to attend the
dance instead of the combo party.

IFC President Bob Doenges, Sig-
ma Chi senior, made the following
statement to the Ring-tum Phi late
last night.

Commends Schlesinger, Kyger

“T would like to commend Tony

Schlesinger and Ross Kyger,” he]!

said, “for their industry and in-
terest in coming up with this solu-
tion after the previous one had
been voted down.”

“Will Bring About Solution”

“This new IFC amendment, I
feel, will bring about a gradual
and effective solution to the com-
bo-University dance conflict. It
does not radically forbid the
combos at any time, but it does
provide the rules to prevent any
slight or large majority in any
house from forcing their will for
a combo upon a minority.”

Consequently, he added, I feel
that each fraternity will re-ex-
amine the fallacious necessity
of having a Friday night combo.

“Once they see the University
is providing much better enter-
tainment.” he continued, “and that
a number of their own members do
not want a combo conflicting with
the University function, there will
be few combos on Friday nights of
any dance set.

“... Responsible Action”

“The IFC realized this,” Doenges
stated, “in voting for the amend-
ment unanimously for two weeks
in succession, and I am_ very
pleased to see it taking this con-
structive and responsible action.”

The plan will not got into effect
until next year.

 

Debate Team Places Third
In Regional Tournament

Washington and Lee debaters cap-
tured third place in an invitational
tournament held Saturday at Bal-
timore, Md.

The novice team of freshmen
Steve Smith and Malcolm Morris
took part in eight rounds of compe-
tition, debating both the affirmative
and negative sides of the question.

On an individual merit basis,
Smith was named fifth affirmative
speaker out of a field of 20 debat-
ers.

Public Drinking

 

;

The Student Control Committee in a recent meeting voiced its dis-
approval at the growing number of reported incidents of public drink-
ing on the part of Washington and Lee students.

It is felt by the Committee that such action not only places a stu-
dent in a position of possible involvement with the police, but that it
leaves a poor impression with the members of the community or visitors
to the campus who view the conduct of W&L students.

In reaching the decision to halt such conduct on the part of stu-
dents, the Committee has expressed its hope that the Student Body
will assume the responsibility necessary to prevent the further dis-

play of such incidents,

Should such responsibility not be forthcoming, the Committee has
stated that individuals would be liable for any reported breach of con-
duct (i.e. consuming alcoholic beverages in public.)

The Committee has already stated before the IFC that any report of
a fraternity gathering at which a large contingent of members public-
ly consume beverages will be submitted to the Faculty Committee on

Fraternities for possible remedy.

Tau Delta, commented. “I express
regrets over the announcement that
Meade Christian will not be a can-
didate for the office of Student Body

President. He is the most qualified*

in the University and in the party.

‘| At this time the University needs

able leadership and he is one of the
3 or 4 that is best able to give it. His
refusal to run will be a detriment
to the University and to the party.”

Jim Russ, president of Phi Kappa
Psi, stated that Christian should
definitely serve on the EC in some
capacity even if it is not as presi-
dent. He further stated that the par-
ty has several other qualified can-
didates which they can call upon to
run.

Tom Rains, president of the KA
house, expressed beliefs that the
University party would benefit from
Christian’s not running. I feel that
the Independent Party’s chances for
success have been seriously hurt by
Christian’s not running.”

Bill Lowry, NFU, stated “Meade
would do well in any position,” and
hoped that he would continue to
serve the student body in some cap-
acity. However, he felt that the Uni-
versity party would be placed in a
better position because of the de-

:| cision by Christian.

Kappa Sig president, Rick Frisbie,
believed that Christian would be the
number one candidate of the Inde-
pendent Party. His refusal to run
would not give the party much
chance. “However,” he stated, “Don’t
count us out, we still have Payne
and Montgomery.”

Forensic Union
Hears Debaters

Washington and Lee’s crack de-
bate team got in more practice last
night on a new debate question as
they appeared before a meeting of
th Forensic Union.

The faculty and student body was
split on a decision on the question
“Resolved: That capital punishment
should be abolished.”

The student vote was 22-6 in
favor of the negative team, with
many of the more than 40 students
present abstaining. Members of
the faculty present voted 5-0 for
the affirmative team.

The affirmative team for this
cross-examination debate was com-
posed of Al Eckes and Bill Noell.
Pete Straub and Bill Boardman took
the negative side. The major argu-
ments revolved around the question
of whether capital punishment was a
determent to crime or not.

Bahama
Holiday
Is Theme

By STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

The theme of Spring
Dances this year will center
around a “Bahama Holiday,”
it was announced today.

Charlie McCord, president of the
dance set, said that the decorations
will have a West Indies influence in
keeping with the tone of the con-
certs which this year are concen-
trated on Caribbean and American
folk music.

Major Work By Babcock

The major part of the work on the
decorations is being handled by Jud
Babcock, SAE junior.

There will be murals around the
walls portraying the various cus-
toms and traditions of the West
Indies, McCord, a Beta junior, said.

The greatest portion of the dec-
orations, however, will be cen-
tered around the stage areas. A
bamboo hut will be built over
the stage to heighten the effect
of the island atmosphere.

The main portion of the stage
will consist of a ramp-way built
out into the audience so that a
better view is afforded the audi-
ences.

Different Lighting System

Also featured at Spring Dances
will be a different lighting system.
Several large spotlights will be
rented for use during the concerts,
McCord said.

Springs will feature primarily
American and West Indian folk mu-
sic. The Friday night concert will
feature Leon Bibb and Meg Welles.
Leon Bibb’s style has been com-

 

The Dance Board will make
available to any student or guest
not holding a dance plan a com-
bination ticket for both Spring
concerts, The ticket will cost $7.50
and will admit the holder to both
concerts. The price for a single
concert will be $5.00

 

pared to Belafonte’s by several crit-
ics, and his program will be cen-
tered around Carribean folk songs.

Although Bibb sings a_ great
many folk songs, as if he had
lived with them all his life, he is
not primarily a folk singer. He had
a varied career in the entertain-
ment world.

He has sung in theatres, night
clubs, small informal halls, and in
big open air festivals.

Critics Hail

Critics have hailed him as a top
interpreter of folk music. They
have said that his voice is both mov-
ing and flexible.

Dance Board President Steve
Galef said recently that Bibb’s
appearance at W&L is part of a
continuing trend to provide more
versatile entertainment for the
Student Body.

Bibb and Meg Welles will appear
Friday night from 8 to 10 p.m. in
the Gym.

and his Whiskeyhill Singers will

A torn, tattered sign, familiar to all Ring-tum Phi staffers

All the Ring-tum Phi needs is a small office where it can

At present it is virtually impossible to find a back issue of
the paper or an old picture that could be used again.

The proofreaders, re-writers, headline writers, and make-up

we have no adequate place to work. Space is needed and need-
ed badly in the vicinity of the print shop.

While R-t P staff members are stuffed into the print shop
like sardines, there is a large ‘‘unused”’ space in the very next
building. A big room in the IBM building has been vacated by
the Civil Defense and now contains one computer, which takes
up approximately 15 per cent of the room.

Desperately, we ask: may the Ring-tum Phi have some of
this “unused” space in the IBM building, or must it continue
suffering from the “cracker box’’ conditions of the print shop.

Ask for Information

Most of the children’s letters ask
for information about the life of
Lee, the recumbent statue, Lee’s
family, Traveller, and other ques-
tions of this nature. But ever so
often, an odd one will come in.

Some ask for Virginia history.
These get an answer referring
them to some other source. A girl
in Layton, Utah, once wrote and
asked not only for information
about Lee, but for some on Bess
Truman. She was referred to the
Truman Library in Independence,
Missouri.

Not all of the letters come from
children, however. There’s one in
the files from a man in Los Ange-
les, who wanted to know wheng
Traveller died, where he was first
buried, and when the body was ex-
humed and put in the glass case in
Lee Chapel.

Another man wrote asking for the
history of Lee’s physical and men-
tal condition from childhood to
adulthood.

And everybody seems to ask
“Where are Lee and his family
buried?”

Rowe and his secretary answer
all these things somehow, often re-
ferring the writer to another source.
“They ask questions we can’t an-
swer,” Rowe said, “but we try to

answer them anyway.”

Press Representation To The EC

The E.C., we are happy to report, has at last opened the
legislative meetings to members of the campus press.

We feel that this move not only will allow the Student
Body to get more and better information concerning the E.C.,
but that criticism leveled at the E.C. will also drop.

Although we recognize the opening of the meetings to the
press as being a healthy step forward, we must add that we are
somewhat disappointed at the move not being offered as a
constitutional amendment.

Even though our problem is solved for this year, what
about the years to come? What’s to guarantee that the meet-
ings will always be open to the press?

End Of The ‘Communism’ Series

Today marks the final publishing of the Tuesday Edi-
tion’s series, “Washington and Lee Looks At Communism.”

The nine-part series, which was written by W&L fac-

better look at the threat which faces the free world. We
hope the series served this purpose.

cause of the period of transition in which we now
find ourselves, and these unsolved problems.

For better or worse the last election aroused stu-
dent interest in student affairs and the non-fraterni-
ty men to be vocal in their criticisms.

A student body position is, apparently, no bed
of roses these days, and, thus, there is all the more
need for aggressive leadership. These men who are

qualified and experienced should come out with

positive programs in a positive manner so that the
interest may be maintained at a high level and the

two week-ends which are really available.

Fortunately the IFC and the faculty has so far
been very co-operative in “bending the rule” when
necessary, but it’s a lot of extra trouble for them
and for the Houses to initiate and act upon a
special requests for these situations.

Maybe we could get a special, permanent ruling

Cuba Causes U.S. To See Red Threat At Back Door

By DR. L. F. SENSABAUGH

Only a short time ago, few peo-
ple in the United States were
aware that Communism existed in
Latin America. But a revolution
which led to the establishment
of a Communist government in
Cuba has suddenly changed our
thinking. Now we are painfully
aware of this unwanted govern-
ment even though we may not
yet recognize the extent and the
seriousness of the overall threat.

It would be dangerous for us to
eonclude that the Castro regime
represents the only Marxist-Len-
inist penetration into this hemis-
phere. It is true that Cuba is the
only nation that has an out and
out Communist government, but
in some of the other countries the
Communist parties are fairly large
and their fellow-travelers are ev-
en more numerous, At the start of
the present decade, Argentina had

some 80,000 Communists, Brazil
was second with about 50,000,
Venezuela had some 40,000 and

Chile around 25,000. The number
of members in other countries
varied from a mere 200 in Nic-
aragua to 5000 in Mexico and 6000
in Peru. Some of the Latin Am-
erican countries have made the
party illegal; other states allow
the Communists to function. And
there is a trend today for the Lat-
in American countries to establish

diplomatic relations with Russia
and China.

Before continuing with the na-
ture of and the activities of the
Communists in Latin America, it
is fitting to comment on the posi-
tion of left-wing movements
which are not Communistic. There
are many of them, and their mem-
bers have tried for a long time
to bring about reforms that would
make the countries less suscep-
tible to Communist propaganda.
These groups are quite liberal and
some even radical but they are
not Marxist. The Aprista move-
ment in Peru and the Accion
Democratica in Venezuela are
good examples of the leftist move-
ments. The future of real democ-
racy in Latin America could well
rest with these groups. Whether
we like them or not, the choice
may be between them and the
Communists.

There seems to be a belief in
this country that these organiza-
tions cooperate too often with the
Communists. This may be true,
but there is also evidence that the
right-wing groups have not hesi-
tated to cooperate with the Com-
munists, if it was to their advan-
tage. Several years ago, a Unit-
ed States senator submitted a re-
port on Communist activities in
Latin America.

The report stated that the Dom-
inican dictator, Rafael Leonidas
Trujillo, was the constant foe of
Communism. What the report did
not state was that Trujillo in 1943
ordered his labor organizations to
join the Communist-controlled
labor groups. Nor was there any
reference to the fact that three
years later the same dictator made
a deal with exiled Dominican

Communists to return to their na-
tive land and participate in a
democratic “election.” The party
was legalized for the occasion.
Although the Communist party
in Argentina went underground in
1948, after being outlawed, Juan
Domingo Peron’s henchmen tried
to strike a bargain with the Com-
munists during the election of
1946. The Peronistas were willing

WEL Looks At Communism

Last Of A Series

This is the last in a series of nine ar-

various aspects.

haps one of the most important of the

to legalize the Communist party
and allow a Communist press if
it would support Peron. The Com-
munists refused.

In 1945, Getulio Vargas, dictator
of Brazil for fifteen years, released
Brazil’s number one Communist,
Luiz Carlos Prestes, from ‘prison.
About a month later, Prestes
spoke to some 70,000 people in Rio
and urged that Vargas should not
resign. Bargains were denied, but
the Communists polled 700,000
votes in the election of that year.

But to return to the Communists
themselves. Their parties came in-
to existence in Latin America
within a few years after the Revo-
lution of 1917. Many of those who
joined had been anarchists or so-
cialists and had brought their
radical ideas from Spain and It-
aly. The Communist party was or-
ganized in Mexico in 1919, in
Uruguay in 1920 and in Brazil and
Chile in 1921. Other parties came
into existence in subsequent
years; the one in Bolivia was not
formed until 1949.

For the most part, the Commun-
ist party in Latin America has fol-
lowed the usual party line from
Moscow. They followed Lenin,
then Stalin and now Khrushchev;
they have been opposition parties
and have cooperated in Popular
Fronts. They opposed Fascism;
they opposed the war until Ger-

many attacked Russia; then they
espoused the cause of the demo-
cratic allies.

In recent years, the Communists
have supported the strongly-na-
tionalistic elements in Latin Am-
erica and of course have joined in
the hue and cry against American
imperialism. In some instances, the
Communists have been successful
in infiltrating the several armies.
This was especially true in Brazil
in the 1920’s and 1930's.

Wake Forest Dumps 69-62

Edwards, Munroe, Begg Take Firsts

The W&L trackmen were upset
Saturday when the Wake Forest
Deacons ran to a 69-62 victory and
destroyed Washington and Lee’s
three year string of 16 consecutive
dual meet victories.

Hickey Upset
The surprise of the afternoon
came when Virginia state sprint
champ Jim Hickey was defeated in
both the 100-yard and 220-yard
dashes by Wake Forest’s Ernie Wil-
liams. Distance runner Mike Shank

 

was also defeated as he was forced
to take a third place in both the mile
and the two mile runs.

W&L’s Chuck Begg and Mick-
ey Walker placed first and sec-
ond in the Javelin event while
Tom Edwards and Henry Sackett
swept the broad jump, but it was
not enough to contain the Dea-
cons. The Generals were only able
to win three other events as Dave
Monroe took the shot put, Skip
Essex grabbed first place in the

Lacrosse Team Faces Tough U. of Mass. Stickmen;
Van Rensselaer, Wootten, Will Not See Full Action

The W&L lacrosse team takes on
the University of Massachusetts
stickmen this afternoon, looking for
their first win of the season.

Big Team

The Redmen from up north are
fresh from a 10-7 scrimmage vic-
tory over Williams and labeled by
Coach Bob McHenry as “a good size
team, aggressive with good stick-
handlers.”

8-2

The U. of Mass. ran through
their schedule last year with eight
wins, two losses and one tie.

Coach MeHenry’s team will be
without the full services of Bob
Van Rensselaer and Randy Wootten.
Van Rensselaer was injured last
week in practice while midfield reg-
ular Wootten has been hampered by
sickness. Veteran Danny Reed will
see more action at defense and

Good Frosh

McHenry is happy with the fresh-

them “the best group we’ve ever
had.” Frosh Carroll Klingelhofer
and Bob Hankey are starting for the
Generals and several other first year
men are playing regularly.

Thinking back over the game last

to find his usual game and drop-
ped his match 6-1, 6-3 to his
strong Dartmouth opponent.

Playing in the third position, Jim
De Young lost a close decision. De
Young played exceedingly well but
was finally overpowered 6-4, 7-5.

The remaining three singles posi-
tions for W&L were filled by Jim
Mell, Thurmond Bishop and Bud
Hollman. Each of these men were
defeated in singles competition by
decisive scores.

All three of the doubles matches
were closely contested and well-
played. Two of them were three set
matchs, but the Dartmouth players
held out to win all three. They end-
ed up with a 9-0 record for the day.

Pitching Is Ninety Per Cent

Of Baseball Bemoans Lyles

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Writer

“Pitching is ninety per cent of
baseball.”

This statement has been attrib-
uted to several major league man-
agers over the years, and most re-
cently to Paul Richards, one-time
manager of the Chicago White Sox
and Baltimore Orioles and now gen-
eral manager of the National
League’s new Houston franchise.

Whatever its origin, Washington
and Lee baseball coach Joe Lyles
isn’t about to dispute this axiom.

He’s said before, and probably
will say again before the Gen-
erals wind up their season, that
the team’s success depends on how
well his pitchers come through.

At present, he’s got six working
out, four righthanders and two
southpaws. There’s veteran strength
in senior Phil Sharp, a righthander,
and sophomore Brice Gamber, a
southpaw with a 1-1 record last
year.

To back them up, there are
righthanders Jim Gwinn, a senior
back after a two-year absence,

freshmen Mason McGowin and
Louie Paterno, and _ another
southpaw, freshman Chris Wigert.

Lyles was depending on compe-
tition with Springfield College last
week to give him a chance to take
a look at his hurlers in action. Un-
fortunately the weather turned bad,
and Springfield left town early, in
search of sunnier climes.

Saturday and Sunday Lyles held
scrimmage games, pitting his “A”
squad, made up chiefly of veterans,
against a “B” squad of freshmen
and reserves.

In two seven inning games Sat-
urday, and an eight inning affair
Sunday, he got a good chance to
see his pitchers under fire.

Gamber hurled five innings Sat-
urday, and looked “very impressive”
once he settled down. The tall
southpaw with the pretzel motion
has a good chance of being the
pitcher for the Generals’ opener
next Saturday at Elon.

Gwinn looked “fairly good” in

 

the innings he pitched Saturday.
But the surprise came Sunday.

Wigert, pitching for the “B”
squad, threw six innings of no-hit
ball. He was troubled by wildness,
which made for lots of walks and
an eventual 5-5 tie after eight, but
the wildness served one constructive
purpose in keeping the opposing hit-
ters from digging in.

McGowin, pitching for the “A”
squad, also looked good.

The hitters got in their licks
over the weekend, despite all this
sharp pitching. Ned Hobbs got a
360-foot homer, rightfielder Buck
Rose got two hits, Chuck Lane
got two, and Mike Monier got
what Lyles called a “good hit.”

Communism In Cuba Threatens

Our Very Way Of Life Here

(Continued from page 2)

In some countries, the Com-
munist party is a real threat to
the existing government. It is not
necessarily true that the people as
a whole would select a Commun-
ist regime, but they could sud-
denly find themselves with one.
Take Brazil, for example. Francis-
co Juliao, who has admitted his
Marxist leanings, is the leader of
the farmers of the drought-ridden
northeast. These people are des-
perate; the government at Rio has
done little to alleviate their suf-
fering. Luiz Carlos Prestes still
seems to have an almost mystical
influence over many Brazilians.

The small middle class has been
almost wiped out by the fantastic
inflation, and Brazilians as a whole
are surely aware of the wrong-
doings of their political and eco-
nomic leaders. Brazil is on the
verge of an explosion; the Com-
munists could take advantage of
this situation. President Kennedy’s
reluctance to press Brazil over the
confiscation of an American-
owned telephone company by the
governor of Rio Grande do Sul
may indicate how delicate the sit-
uation is.

President Miguel Ydigoras Fu-
entes of Guatemala has stated that
the recent and serious troubles in
his country have come from the

Communists, especially those from
Cuba. The United States may have
thought that it settled the Guate-
mala affair years ago in forcing
Jacobo Arbenz Guzman from the
presidency. Now the problem has
some up again,

Communism in Latin America
poses a serious threat to the peace
and safety of this hemisphere; it
is a greater danger than existed in
the 1820’s when President Mon-
roe, disturbed by the Holy Alli-
ance, made his now-famous pro-
ouncement. Then, the Latin Am-
erican states had doubts about
the danger, and it appears that
many of them today have doubts
about the Communist danger.
Secretary Dulles at Caracas and
Secretary Rusk at Punta del Este
had to struggle to get common
action against the Communist
threat. The old fear of interven-
tion from the north influences the
attitude of the larger Latin Am-
erican states.

It is going to be really hard to
convince these same states of the
imminent peril of international
Communism. If we are unsuccess-
ful, it may be necessary to resorgy
to open unilateral action, although
such action would reverse the pol-
icy the United States has follow-
ed for the past thirty years.

main purpose in holding the debate
was to prepare his affirmative team

Chaffin further reported that W&L
had just been challeneged by Ran-
dolph-Macon to debate on WRVA-
TV in Richmond next month. “This,”
he said, “would make a total of four
television debates in two months.
We have appeared on three net-

Dartmouth Edges Golfers;
Lee Wins For Generals, 5-4

By JUD REIS
Assistant Sports Editor

The Dartmouth golf team drop-
ped W&L 6-3 in the Generals’ op-
ening match last Saturday.

The scoring used was match play,
with each winning individual
awarded one point, and the team
with the best ball in each foursome
getting one point. The match was
close with Dartmouth winning only
after the seventeenth hole of the
last foursome.

In the first foursome Jack Varda-
man and Grantham Couch of W&L
each tied their Dartmouth oppon-
ents. The best ball for this foursome
was also even. Playing No. 3 for
the Generals Ronnie Stewart lost to
Payne of Dartmouth 7 and 6, but
Will Lee beat Dartmouth’s Linck
5 and 4. The best ball was halved so
the score stood 3-3 after two four-
somes had completed play.

In the final foursome Lukart
of Dartmouth beat Steve Henry 2
and 1. Warren Hughes lost by an
identical score to Dartmouth’s
Gregory. W&L lost the best ball
one up, and Dartmouth had the
match 6-3.

The Generals’ next match will be
the Hot Springs Invitational during
the last week-end of Spring vaca-
tion. For this tournament W&L will
host Colgate, U. Va., and Carnegie
Tech. Coach Twombly will use the
same men as in the Dartmouth
match except Paul McBride will be
playing in place of Grantham Couch.

Christian Declines To Run
(Continued from page 1)

Dave Peters, president of Sigma
Nu, believes that because of Chris-
tian’s dropping out of the picture,
Ireland is almost sure to get the top
office. If Christian had run, it would
have been pretty tough competition.

Charlie Commander of the Uni-
versity party stated that “If Chris-
tian feels that strongly about not
running, I think he has a right to
drop from the race.”

The results of Christian’s an-
nouncement not to run will have
far reaching consequences on the
Washington and Lee political scene.
However, in view of last year’s elec-
tion, it is difficult to draw any im-
mediate conclusions.
