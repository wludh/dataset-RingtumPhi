Frank Young

Dance Board

Selects Young

By Robert Thomas

Frank Young, Phi Delt
junior from Birmingham, Ala-
bama, has been named Vice-

président of the Dance Board

for the 1961-62 school year.

Board President Steve Galef, in
announcing the appointment Thurs-
day, stated: “We were favorably
impressed during the interview and
have every confidence in Frank’s
exécuting’ the duties of the office.
He mentioned several new ideas that
met with our approval.”

Yourig’s primary function will be
to assist the Dance Board President
and to learn the functions of that
office, since he will become Presi-

would like to try his hand at the
students’ paintings which will form
the decorations for Openings
Dances should contact Peter Agel-
asto at the Phi Psi house by Mon-
day night.

 

dent next year. He will also man-
age the’ sale of costumes for the
Fancy Dress Ball this winter.

The innovations Young will acti-
vate is the formation of a Dance
Board Advisory Council open to all
W&L students. The council will
serve to acquaint members with the
activities of the Dance Board itself,
thereby aiding the Board in its en-
deavors and providing experienced
members for next year.

This council has been in the plan-
hing stage and will soon be formed.

In the spring; a survey of the en-

tire student body will be conducted
to determine the tastes and prefer-
ences’ of entertainment for next
year’s dance sets. Young hopes to
provide performers that conform to
the’ prevailing interests of the cam-
pus.
Another tentative innovation will
be the holding of the dance sets in
the Freshman Commons, thereby
providing a more appropriate and
commodious atmosphere for the ac-
tivity.

Galef also commented: “Young will
receive much responsibility as pos-
sible in: the performance of his
duties. We feel he is well qualified
and are expecting a high degree of
leadership.”

Young’s activities include: frater-
nity treasurer, Cold Check Com-
mitteeman and SWMSFC. He is also
a member of the Glee Club, House
Managers’ Association, and the White
Friars. He is a Dean’s List student,
and has a 1.8 overall average. Young
is majoring in History and intends
to study law.

Galef further mentioned that all
has been arranged for Openings
Dance Set, October 13 and 14. Dance
Plan Sales have reached 825, with
the goal set at 900. Complete support
of the plans will enable the presen-
tation of an outstanding array of tal-
ent at all four dance sets.

Debate Society

EC Discusses
Conduct Group

At its meeting Tuesday

| night the Executive Committee

heard a report from president
Andrew McThenia on the stu-
dent government conference

at Randolph-Macon College
last weekend, and reports from Joe
Goldstein, chairman of the Library
Committee, and Steve Rutledge, As-
similation Committee chairman.

The EC also approved Steve
Galef’s nominations of Bill Noell,
Stan Atwood, and Steve Henry to
the three non-fraternity posts on
the Dance Floor Committee.

A motion by president McThenia
to change the wording in Honor
System procedures from “accused
of a violation of the Honor System”
to “accused of a breach of honor”
was defeated by a 7-3 vote.

The EC gave its backing to a
program that Goldstein outlined to
more rigidly enforce the library
rules, particularly the rules against
unauthorized removal and hiding of
books.

Goldstein and Rutledge were each
asked to send in monthly reports on
the activities of their respective
committees.

Student Disciplinary Group?

President McThenia reported that
representatives of the other schools
at the student government confer-
ence preferred to have student mis-
conduct cases handled by a student
group rather than a faculty com-
mittee.

McThenia sad he would like to
appoint a committee to study the
possibility of having some student
group other than the EC handle
cases of student misconduct here.
The faculty has a committee which
handles all such cases now.

Committeemen Meade Christian
and Tim Ireland volunteered to serve
on the study committee.

McThenia said many representa-
tives at the conference said they
would like to become better ac-
quainted with the system of student
government at W&L.

All members of the EC were pres-
ent at the Tuesday meeting.

The EC meets on Tuesday again
for its regular weekly meeting, at
7 p.m. in the Student Union.

GOP To Meet
Tuesday Night

The first Young Republican meet-
ing of the 1961-1962 school year will
be held next Tuesday night October
3, at 7 p.m. in the Student Union.

Craig Distlehorst, Region III
Chairman of Organization for the
Young Republicans and Charles
Wright, the Virginia Vice Chairman,
will discuss Young Republican or-
ganization from the college club to
the national level. A report will be
given on the National Y. R. Con-
vention held this past summer.

Hank Oder, Rockbridge County
Republican Chairman will discuss
the present gubernatorial race in
Virginia and how the W&L Y. R.
Club can participate in it.

After the gubernatorial election in
November, the club, in cooperation
with the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, will present a series of dis-
cussions of practical politics. Guest
speakers will be invited to guide
these discussions.

For the first time, the club hopes
to be able to start a newspaper to
provide a sounding board for stu-
dent opinion on events of national
and international significance. It is
also hoped that political events on
campus may be given fuller discus-
sion and coverage through this
means.

All student Republicans are urged
to attend this first organizational
meeting, even if they feel they will
not have the time to actively par-
ticipate in club activities. An in-
active membership list will be drawn
up so that these boys will receive
Republican announcements.

The officers for the 1961-62 Young
Republican’s Club will be elected
at this meeting. Freshmen are elig-
ible for office.

 

 

NOTICE

Plans are underway for Parents’
Weekend, October 27-28. Mr. Robert
Whitehead, assistant to the president,

Senior Law Student Proposes
New Student Body Constitution

By Lanny Butler
The Washington and Lee Executive Committee is studying
the feasibility of adapting a completely revamped student body

constitution.

teeman, distributed for consideration mimeographed copies of

 

Conservative

Society Plans
Kickoff Meeting

The newly formed Conservative
Society of Washington and Lee will
hold its opening meeting on Wednes-
day, October 4 at 7 p.m. in duPont
auditorium. Society president Brent
Arthur announced last night that
the Film Communist Encirclement—
1961 would be shown then.

The purpose of the meeting will
be to explain the purpose and func-
tions of the Society to any interested
newcomers, to welcome those who
are interested in active participa-
tion in the Society’s program, and to
organize that program for the com-
ing semester.

On October 17, the Society will
present William S. P. Cotter of
Yale, who is the Organizational Di-
rector of the Young Americans for
Freedom. At this time, the film
Operation Abolition will be shown.

Society vice president, Andy Mc-
Thenia, said he expected a good
turn-out for the opening meeting.
He emphasized the fact that the
meeting would be open not only to
the W&L student body, but also to
any townspeople or other outsiders
who might be interested in the
“conservative” philosophy of gov-
ernment.

Conservative Aims

The Conservative Society will of-
fer “a medium through which in-
terested students can express their
views on conservative government.”
The objects of the Society as stated
in its constitution are as follows:

To provide the organizational
framework to implement the general
objectives of the Conservative So-
ciety as announced in its doctrine of
beliefs taken from the Sharon State-
ment as composed by the Young
Americans for Freedom on Septem-
ber 11, 1961.

The publication of a journal con-
cerned with national and _ inter-
national affairs.

The establishment of a speaker’s
forum to bring prominent conser-
vative scholars, politicians, and jour-
nalists to the campus of Washington
and Lee.

The presentation of a course to
interest members in practical politics.
This course, which is non-partisan
in nature was developed by the
United States Chamber of Commerce
to be given to any group interested
in acquainting themselves with the
organization of American politics.

The executive board of the So-
ciety consists of Brent Arthur,
Uncas McThenia, Tim Ireland, Edge
Jackson, Steve Galef, Rosie Page,
Ned Ames, Don Huffman and Dave
Knight.

an experimental constitution which
he described as “more up-to-date
and less cumbersome” than the pres-
ent instrument.

“IT have proposed this new con-
stitution hoping not only that it
will be accepted, but that it will
stimulate further thought on the
subject of student self-government,”
said Paul.

Paul was appointed last Spring by
student body president Uncas Mc-
Thenia to study the present con-
stitution. “It soon became apparent
that an entirely new constitution
was needed.”

“T had three objectives in mind
when I began work. First, it seemed
absolutely necessary to modernize

 

 

Paul’s Proposed Changes

€There will be a twelve-member
Executive Committee. But instead of
the secretary of the student body
and the publications board repre-
sentative who now serve on the
committee, there will be two repre-
sentatives at large elected from the
student body.

{Procedure in honor offenses and
in public trials remains much the
same as it is now.

All students must pay a deposit
of $2.00, refundable at the polls
when they vote, to have voting priv-
ileges, or to run for office. If the
deposit is not made within two
weeks of the start of the session,
the fee is $7.50. No registrations are
accepted in the period 20 days be-
fore election day.

An election board will admin-
ister all details of the campaign and
election.

©This election board, with the
advice of the psychology department
will administer a battery of tests to
all candidates. Results of the tests
will be publicly posted and written
on all ballots. The tests will measure
“intelligence and general ability;
initiative; resourcefulness and crea-
tive ability; and leadership ability.”

“Decisions and acts of the execu-
tive committee will be subject to a
trial of constitutionality before a
board of judicial review. This board
of judicial review will have three
members, one selected at random
from the student body at large and
one each, selected at random, from
the senior academic and law classes.

"A reform committee and a codi-
fication committee will each meet
periodically to review the consti-
tution, constantly revising it to make
it “a more flexible tool of the will
of the Student Body.”

example, there is no need to de-
scribe at length the process of

Eggheads Match Wits
In Quiz Bowl Tryout

By Randall Jones

Guffaws of amazement and pregnant “ahs!” filled the
air last night as Presidential assistant Frank Parsons admin-
istered the first of a series of elimination quizzes to pick the four

on the GE College Bowl quiz

Seventy-nine men tried the test.
The advance betting on Washington and Lee’s chances in

*the College Bowl must have turned
sharply in W&L’s favor.

After drawing only a dozen or so
applicants for the team at a Monday
night meeting, Mr. Parsons, who is
supervising the team selection for
the administration, instituted a crash
publicity program in which he sent
out personal letters to some 20 stu-
dents recommended by the faculty,
and had professors making short pep
talks in classes yesterday.

The result was the 79 men who
tried the first of a series of prelimi-
nary quizzes last night.

The meeting had been scheduled
for the journalism lecture room, but
when the journalism room was filled
and people were still trying to get in
the door, it was moved from there
over to Newcomb 8, which was very
nearly filled up.

There Mr. Parsons administered a
written quiz of fifty questions. You
had 20 seconds to get the answers.

Sample question: “Take the
number of famed islands in the
St. Lawrence River and add this
number to the number of degrees
in an equalateral triangle. For
your answer, give the number
which must be added to this sum
to get the date of the Battle of
Hastings.”

Mr. Parsons says he plans to give
one or two more written quizzes
like the one last night before he
attempts to cut down the number
trying out. “We really need to give
100 or 150 questions before we can
tell anything,” he said.

He said that if more students want
to try out for the quiz team, he will

give the first quiz again, but would
not be able to do it on an individ-
ual basis.

After the written quizzes have
provided the basis for a first cut, Mr.
Parsons said he would go on to
oral elimination quizzes similar to
the College Bowl itself.

The GE College Bowl is seen in
this area at 5:30 p.m. Sundays on
Channel 7, Roanoke.

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

On To New York

Last night’s large turnout for the first trial quiz for the
College Bowl quiz team must have been gratifying to everyone
who would like to see Washington and Lee “‘win again another
time” in this peculiar intellectual sport.

 

From the large number of men who tried the quiz last
night, we ought to be able to field a team which can hold its
own against Pomona, or Amherst, or whoever they send up
against us.

The trial quiz was tough but stimulating, and certainly a
lot of fun. We ourselves retired to the Liquid afterwards last
night to pose a few more experimental questions at one another.

Maybe W&L will once again prove that the pursuit of
knowledge and having a good time DO mix.

Anyway, we’re pretty gung-ho about the forthcoming
battle of wits.

More Sound And Fury

John Paul’s proposed revision of the student body consti-
tution which is released today contains a number of suggestions
which are worthy of consideration.

We feel that the nominating convention could well be done
away with.

The overall emphasis of the document is primarily on
ways and means by which the quality of student leadership
may be improved. We question some of the means and will dis-
cuss them at greater length later.

We feel that the student body leadership has been excellent
on the whole and that this year’s crop of campus leaders is one
of the best ever.

Certainly no Executive Committee in recent years has dem-
onstrated its academic ability so well, nor performed so much
individual service for the student body.

What is lacking is emphasis on the most important problem
which faces the Executive Committee—its responsiveness to
the student body and the means by which it may exert stronger
leadership here.

These needs will not be met by constitutional amendments
but rather by more imaginative use of the influence of the
executive committee.

The EC’s decision last week to encourage more thorough
press coverage of its meetings was a step in the right direction.

A similar forceful use of its present power will do more
for the student body than some more of last spring’s sound and
fury about the constitution.

Next, The Liberals

The Young Republicans and the Conservative Society
seem to be off to a running start this year. Now we’re waiting
to see if the Young Liberals will rally to the support of their
boy in the White House.

We're all in favor of this political activity. It certainly
speaks well for the concern of the present college generation
with the political role they must play in the next few decades.

We'd like to see some opposition to the present conserva-
tive domination of the campus. We have our own opinions but
it would be well for an opposition party to spring up to keep us
right-wingers on our toes.

The Library Problem

This week’s Executive Committee meeting was largely de-
voted to a discussion with Joe Goldstein, chairman of the li-
brary committee, about possible means of gaining a wider
adherence to the rules of the library.

Joe said that unauthorized removal and hiding, particularly
of reserve books, were common offenses.

The library committee has had a great deal of difficulty
enforcing these rules. We understand that the Student Bar
Association has had the same trouble in the Law Library.

It’s about time that these irresponsible and dishonest acts
stopped. We are 100 per cent behind any measures the SBA

or library committee fell necessary to stop these offenses.

 

Registration Figures Released;
Total Enrollment, Failures Noted

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Washington and Lee University
has a total enrollment of 1185 men
for the present academic semester,
an increase of 22 over the 1960-61
total of 1163, according to final reg-
istration figures.

Of this years total, 1058 are un-
dergraduates in the School of Arts
and Sciences and 127 are law stu-
dents.

Freshmen this year number 315.

The present construction of new
freshmen dormitories, which neces-
sitated destruction of old dorms, has
caused a housing problem for fresh-
men.

Frosh Dorm Filled

Freshman Dormitory is filled to
capacity with 293 men. Baker Dorm
houses eight freshmen; 7 University
Place, seven; and private homes in

 

Lexington, five. Two freshmen live
in their own homes and attend W&L
as day students.

The freshmen who live off campus
are primarily late acceptances who
were unable to get dormitory facili-
ties. Some of the men, however, were
allowed to choose off-campus resi-
dences due to the scarcity of dorm
rooms.

Davis Dorm, the law dormitory,
houses 22 law students. The re-
remainder of the men in that college
live either in private homes or fra-
ternity houses.

As most law students are married,
the number living in fraternity hous-
es is small. Two law students live
in the Freshman Dormitory as
counselors.

Perhaps as a note of warning to
the freshman class, Dean’s Pusey’s

WGL Epic Series

ODK Circle:
Mute Reminder
Of Golden Age

The Friday Resarch Staff

(Editor’s note—In cooperation
with the Assimilation Committee,
we will from time to time publish
historical monographs on well-
known campus architectural fea-
tures. This week we are publishing
a critical history of the ODK circle.)

This year’s entering freshmen will
certainly have noticed the circle of
stone benches which stands beside
the walk from the Freshman Dorm
to the colonnade, in front of the
haunted house known as “the old
Co-op.”

The circle of benches was given
the University by the National So-
ciety of Omicron Delta Kappa in
1949, on the occasion of Washing-
ton and Lee’s 200th Anniversary.

In the center of the circle is an
ODK key. This key is the only
original ODK key extant. The Na-
tional Society decided to enshrine it
here as a reminder that the Minks
of bygone ages were great men in-
deed. It rests here at Washington
and Lee, a mute reminder of a
glorious golden age, a day when
heroes attended W&L, when gods
walked with men.

We know from the writings of an
obscure chronicler, a Calyx writer
whose name has been lost to poster-
ity, that this key belonged to one
Cyrus Studly.

Studly first came to W&L as
prince of a band of watermen from
White Marsh, Virginia, in the Year
of the Brawl at the Liquid (old
Liquid chronicles indicate a great
pitched battle took place between
the rival tribes of Mink and Wahoo
in 1911).

The Watermen, possessors of a
technologically superior culture, soon
rose to dominate the University.

Studly himself became captain of
the football team, president of the
student body, and town manager of
Lexington. His right-hand man, one
Ivan Perkins, became patriarch of
the University Christian Association,
a position of some influence when
church and state were not yet sep-
arated here.

We know no more of the feats of
Studly beyond a small note in the
Sweet Briar chronicle which indi-
cates he often led raiding parties
over the mountains and was finally
bought off by being made rector of
their Board of Trustees. In addi-
tion, each year he was sent the
pick of young womanhood of Am-
herst to serve in his palace on
Red Square.

Old Minks often pause by the
ODK circle during homecomings
weekend to pour out a small liba-
tion and to meditate on the decline
of the University. Men of the stature
of Studly no longer appear on the
rolls here.

Peasant tradition in this area has
it that once a year, during Fancy
Dress, the mighty Studly’s ghost
walks the campus, seeking a man
who can wear his key.

Symptomatic of the decline of
W&L have been the uses to which
the ODK circle was put after it
was built.

Once the mighty Minks stalked
the campus, seeking to prove their
prowess at arms, now the ODK
circle became a scene of gambling.

At first it had been a place where
new students might sit at the knees
of their elders and learn the tra-
ditions of the University.

But soon the elders lost sight of
their duty and, avaricious, sought to
engage the younger men in penny-
pitching. For a target they used the
great key which Studly had worn
on his forays to Sweet Briar and
Charlottesville, which had been in
the vanguard of so many battles at
which W&L’s honor was upheld.

The penny-pitching contests be-
came more and more sophisticated.
Some forty variations on the basic
game were recorded by one student
of those times. Where once students
had applied themselves diligently
to their studies, they spent all their
time practicing with pennies.

The great Alfred McCarrick, who
is even now half-legendary, is said
to have cut two back-to-back hour
quizzes when the stakes in a sudden-
death play-off in which he was en-
gaged rose to many dollars.

Fortunately for the morals of the
student body, the Co-op, which, in
its location right before the ODK
circle, had fomented this nefarious
activity, was moved to its present
location.

So once more the ODK circle
serves its original, semi-religious
purpose. It remains a shrine at
which each student generation is re-
minded of the glorious past of the

 

 

University and emboldened to strive
even harder for manly ideals.

Radio W&XL Plans Language Lab;
Classes Held For Frosh Members

By RANDALL JONES

Boasting more members than ever
before, the staff of Radio Washing-
ton and Lee will start the new sea-
son Monday night with several en-
tirely new features.

With 45 freshmen vying for po-
sitions, Program Coordinator Nick
Denton feels that with basically the
same show set-up, the increased
staff will enable him to appoint sev-
eral long-needed script researchers
and to build an engineering reserve.

A series of announcing and engi-
neering classes are now being held
to familiarize freshmen with the bas-
ic mechanics of radio broadcasting.

Plan Language Lab

Radio W&L expects good response
to a weekly language lab which will
allot an hour’s time to the French,
Spanish, German, and Russian de-

partments.
The show, scheduled to begin
within two weeks, will feature

poetry, drama, songs, folk tales
and panel discussions in each lan-
guage. It is impossible to cover these

 

areas in class, so the programs are
designed to give students a more
lucid picture of the foreign language

Berlin Crisis: Opinions Differ
In First Hand Student Interviews
By ROBIN WOOD

As premier Khrushchev’s threat to sign a separate peace
treaty with Walter Ulbrecht’s East German government draws

near, we in the United States

look on the Berlin crisis with

increased apprehension and disillusionment.
Berlin has become the symbol of the ideological struggle

To the Editor:

The first great debate has already
been held on campus, I think.
Whether it was the first is uncer-
tain. At the present time all we as
students know about our Executive
Committee is what they themselves
wish us to know, and there is the
rub.

The recent debate centered around
letting in one reporter from the
R-t P who would be allowed to
write a report on the regular EC
meeting. The discussion in the EC
was postponed until the represen-
tatives from the two freshmen class-
es, undergraduate and law, are sit-
ting with the body. This would also
allow more time to mull over the
ramifications of making such a move.

But what a gesture if such a
measure were subsequently inacted!
One mere reporter who would have
undisputed license to report what
he observed. But, I ask, what of
that which he was unaware or made
a subtle value judgment upon or
delegated as unnewsworthy?

Not to disparage reporters. All
they can do is give the 5 W’s and
one H and build it into a story. The
difficulty is in the building or writ-

between East and West, and the
prevalent attitude in America is that
the outcome of this dilemma will be
the determining factor in the future
of the free world.

What are the reactions of the
people of Western Europe to the
Communist threat in Berlin? Do
they feel as we do, that Berlin
is a “do or die” issue?

I had the opportunity this sum-
mer to speak to people from Berlin
to Rome about the Berlin Crisis.
These people know the horrors and
cruelties of war, and have seen
both Hitler’s and Stalin’s military
machine ravage their homeland. Yet,
the reactions of these people who
have known war are varied and di-
verse, and their solutions are di-
vergent and various.

West Berlin

In West Berlin itself, the citizens
go out of their way to impress upon
their American guests that they are
relying on Kennedy to be unremit-
ting and adamant in response to Mr.
K’s demands.

West Berliners have placed their
trust and faith in our President, and
feel that our promises to defend
the Western sector must be upheld,
or the prestige and power of the U.S.
as well as the West will fall ig-
nomiously. West Berliners are proud
of their achievements since World
War II, and they are ready to de-
fend at all costs their new found
freedom and heritage.

Austrian Reaction

A Viennese student I talked to is
of the opinion that we should for-
feit our rights in West Berlin and
give the Communists what is right-
fully theirs.

“Let the East Germans have Ber-
lin,” he says, “and then the West
can draw the line of Communism
at the Border between East and
West Germany.”

Another young Austrian argued
along the same line. “The West
would last about a week if war were
to break out in Berlin. The only
way the Western powers can fight
Russia here is diplomatically, for
the Communist military forces in
East Germany could overrun West
Berlin in no time.”

burg, Austria, differs completely

Cold Water
Flush For
Campus Club

By STEVE HENRY

The funniest article printed in
any Washington and Lee publication
of recent years appears not in a
copy of the Southern Collegian, but
rather in the 1961 W&L Handbook,
distributed to this year’s freshman
class.

For those of you have not been
fortunate enough to read this par-
ticular literary gem, we hereby take
it upon ourselves to reproduce it
for you, straight from page 80 of
the Handbook.

The title of the piece, which would
do justice to a Russian propagandist,
is “The Campus Club,” and it reads
as follows:

“From the loosely organized Non-
Fraternity Union there emerged a
few years ago the smaller, more
compact Campus Club, a unit com-
posed of all interested non-fraternity
men.

“It’s growth has been heartening;
for in its short lifetime the Club has
outfitted a lounge and recreation
facilities, participated successfully
in campus intra-murals and become
a leading contender and winner in
the campus-wide scholarship com-
petition.

“It has offered non-fraternity men
an opportunity for close personal
fellowship, a varied social program,
and spirited group creativity, while
remaining essentially an open club.

“The Campus Club looks to the
incoming class for much of its
leadership and welcomes every man
in the class of 1965 to Washington
and Lee.”

BULL. In capital letters, BULL!

Whoever wrote this masterpiece is
in dire trouble; he can be kicked
out of school at any minute for
distortion of the facts, commonly
called lying.

The entire spiel is a masterpiece
of distortion, designed primarily to
make good reading out of a bad
situation.

The only trouble is that some un-
knowing freshman might believe
what he reads in a_ supposedly
reputable campus publication.

He might even join the thing.

Well, let us tell you one thing
brother. Don’t believe everything
you read.

What we would like to know is
this: to whom has the growth of the
Campus Club been heartening?
Certainly not to the majority of
non-fraternity students on campus—
th very group that the good old CC
was organized for in the first place.

Here are a few particularly blunt
facts, which may not jibe with the
facts presented heretofore.

1. The Campus Club is not com-
posed of all interested non-fraterni-
ty men. As a matter of fact, most
interested non-fraternity men would
like to see an immediate cold-water
flush of the organization and all
that it stands for on this campus.

2. The Campus Club has not out-
fitted anything vaguely resembling
a lounge; there are no recreation
facilities (unless, that is, you like
to play checkers in the Student
Union); and Campus Club intramur-
al activities are nil. Participation in
I-M events by non-fraternity stu-
dents has been under the NFU
name, not under the Campus Club.

In fact, we know several boys,
who before participating in intra-
mural basketball last year, waited
until they were positive that they
were not going to be carrying the
Campus Club standard into play..

3. The Campus Club may have
offered non-fraternity students with
“an opportunity for close, personal
fellowship,” but we would not care
to define what the organization’s
meaning for the above quoted words
might denote. They might file a
legal suit against us.

4. A “varied social program” has
been offered. What an absurd joke.
The only social program for non-
fraternity students at W&L is pro-
vided by the fraternities, and cer-
tainly not by the university or by
the Campus Club. When was the
last time the Hot Nuts played in
the Student Union? Or were they
supposed to play in the trunk room
behind Davis Dorm?

There is, however, one truism in
the whole article. The Campus Club
is definitely “open.” Oh, ain’t it
open?

The person who wrote this tidbit
is wasting his time at this univer-
sity. He has a bright career awaiting
for him in advertising.

Anyone who could make the cam-
pus Club sound good could easily
sell iceboxes to Eskimos. In fact,
it should be easier all the way
around.

Defense Was Okay,
But Offense-Blah!

By STEVE HENRY

Sports

Editor

Washington and Lee’s defense against Hampden-Sydney
last Saturday was golden, but the offense, with the exception
of a third quarter touchdown drive, was strictly out to lunch.

Failure to hold blocks and an almost total lack of downfield

blocking made Hampden-Sydney’s*
defense look more potent than it
really was, according to W&L head
coach Lee McLaughlin.

“There just wasn’t any good
blocking going on except in the
third quarter,” he said. “Even then, it
was Suttle who kept us alive.”

Suttle was the brightest spot on
a dark day for Washington and Lee
offensive power.

He kept the Generals’ only sus-
tained drive going with a pair of
clutch passes that meant first downs
and eventually a touchdown.

Another back praised by Mc-
Laughlin was senior halfback Jim
Russ, who accounted for all seven
W&L points on a touchdown and
extra kick.

“Russ made all the plays for us,”
said McLaughlin.

And he did. On fourth down and
six at the Tigers’ 16, Russ leaped
high to catch a Suttle pass and make
it first and goal to go on the eight.

Seconds later, with a fourth down

and two yards for a touchdown, Russ | ¥*

bulled into the end zone for the
Generals only marker of the after-
noon.

Then he calmly added the extra
point that proved to be the win-
ning margin.

 

Defense, however, won the game
for the Generals.

Hampden-Sydney could never get
rolling against a W&L line and sec-
ondary that stopped almost every-
thing that the Tigers could come
up with.

McLaughlin singled out tackle
Bob Payne, back Wayne Bradshaw,
and linebacker Terry Fohs for their
defensive efforts.

“But it was a team effort all the
way on defense,’ he added. “We
can’t ask for anything else there.”

Offense is another story for the
Generals, however. Practice sessions
this week saw new emphasis on
blocking, especially beyond initial
contact in the line.

“We've got the backs to go,” Mc-
Laughlin said. “But they didn’t have
a chance to go far last week because
of the blocking.”

“If we get our blocking down,
we'll be tougher than last year.”

Golf Tryouts
Will Be Held

Qualification trials for the Wash-
ington and Lee golf team will be
held next Thursday and Friday at
the Lexington Country Club, ac-
cording to golf coach E. P. Twombly.

The fall try-outs are designed
to give Coach Twombly an idea
of how much talent he’ll have for
the spring golf season.

Six lettermren return from last
year’s squad that posted a 7-2 over-
all record and a fourth place show-
ing in the state collegiate tourna-
ment at Hot Springs, Va.

Twombly said that boys inter-
ested in playing this year should
contact him at his office in Doremus
Gymnasium before next Thursday.

Frosh Football

This Saturday

footballers open their seven
game schedule at Woodberry
Forest on Saturday with only
10 days practice. But if past

performance is any basis for pre-
diction, coach Dana Swan’s first
season should be a success, for he
has a strong nucleus of high school
and prep school stars to work with.

Speedy and explosive running are
the characteristics of the frosh
backfield. Skipper Chase, who was
named most valuable player in the
All Central Kentucky Conference
last year when he played for Frank-
fort High School, speedy Bill Jami-
son, and Bill Lee are men to watch
in the halfback position.

Fullbacks Ed Bradberry and Dan
Manson add power up the middle.
In the quarterback slot, the Baby
Generals have three fine perform-
ers in Doug Davis, Sam Simpson
and Gordon Gay. .

Coach Swan’s major problems
have been in the line where the
all-important defensive tackle spot
is especially weak. But after watch-
ing his defensive unit in an hour-
long scrimmage Tuesday, he com-
mented, “That’s what we needed—
some rough, tough, hungry tackles.”

The scrimmage uncovered three
tackles—a surprise Swan wasn’t ex-
pecting. Jack Moore, a 180 pound
guard, playing tackle for the first
time Tuesday was the best of the
new recruits. “The defensive tackles

The Washington and Lee varsity
soccer squad opened its 1961 season
against Pfeiffer College this after-
noon in Misenheimer, North Caro-
lina.

Coach Joe Lyles, who called
Pfeiffer “better than last year” when
the Generals won easily, said that
he was counting heavily on fresh-
man performers to bolster his
squad’s performance this year.

Freshmen Steve Hibbard, Pete
Preston, and Charlie Sweet have all
looked good in practice sessions,
and are challenging for starting po-
sitions on the squad.

Lyles says that his freshmen will
have to come through if the booters
are to post a winning mark this
year.

In addition to the frosh prospects,
Lyles has a nucleus of veterans re-
turning from his 1960 edition.

Bruce Jackson, one of the brightest
soccer prospects in recent years,
heads Coach Lyles’ freshman boot-
ers, who will have to support a nu-
cleus of returning veterans if this

Fata Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such
savoir-faire as Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly of
Franz Kafka, she hummed Mozart, she smoked Marlboros.

 

“Soll cao bik re wo Be Stomach tea lke.”

Now, Rock didn’t know Franz Kafka from Pancho Villa, or
Mozart from James K. Polk, but Marlboros he knew full well.
He knew that anyone who smoked Marlboros was modern and
advanced and as studded with brains as a ham with cloves.
Good sense tells you that you can’t beat Marlboro’s exclusive
selectrate filter, and you never could beat Marlboro’s fine flavor.
This Rock knew.

So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to her
talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he went back
to the dormitory and found this letter from his home town
sweetheart Tess:

Dear Rock,

Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down to the
pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of anybody.
Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots of nutsy stuff
like that. Well, I must close now because I got to whitewash
the fence.

Your friend,
Tess
P.S.—I can do my Hula Hoop 8,000 times.

Well sir, Rock thought about Tess and then he thought
about Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly
he knew he had outgrown young, innocent Tess; his heart now
belonged to smart, sophisticated Fata.

Rock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to Tess and looked her in the
eve and said manlily, “I do not love you any more. I love a
girl named Fata Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
all your might if you like.”

“That’s okay, hey,” said Tess amiably. “I don’t love you
neither. I found a new boy.”

“What is his name?” asked Rock.

“Franz Kafka,” said Tess.

“A splendid fellow,” said Rock and shook Tess’s hand, and
they have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata often double-date with Franz and Tess and have heaps of
fun. Franz can do the Hula Hoop 6,000 times. :

A policy of secrecy is detrimental

bers, and wonder just what is go-

It is only a statement of fact that
some changes will be made this year.
As reported elsewhere in this paper
there is a complete proposed con-
stitution which merits a great deal
of consideration. There are also those
ideas fomented by last year’s po-
litical campaign which demand ac-
tion. Only by having the opportuni-
ty to understand and become aware
of these issues and their ramifica-
tions can the student body and their
representatives intelligently make
their decisions.

How, that ugly little work as
Henry James once said, is fairly ob-
vious; at least the first How con-
sists of awareness and knowledge.
The established order is too often
looked on by those desirous of
change and those unfamiliar yet
incitable as something which is bad.
Our constitution and student gov-
ernment is essentially good. But
without knowledgeable and reason-
ed inquiry all might be lost.

Loan Paintings on Exhibit Here

Nineteen paintings from the Cin-
cinnati Museum of Fine Arts have
been placed on display in Evans
dining hall.

The paintings, on loan from the
Ohio museum for the first semester,
were first shown Saturday to visit-
ing members of the Virginia Foun-
dation of Independent Colleges. The
exhibition was opened to the pub-
lic earlier this week, according to
Dr. Marion Junkin, chairman of the
university’s department of fine arts.

The collection, which includes
works by William Meritt Chase and
Arthur B. Davies, was assembled
this summer by Dr. Junkin and
Cincinnati Museum Director Phillip
Adams. It is the first such loan made
to Washington and Lee by this
museum.

The Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Concert Guild will open its
series of programs on Thursday,
Oct. 5 in Lee Chapel presenting Bela
Szilagi, pianist. Five other concerts
in the series include Oscar Mc-
Cullough, baritone, Nov. 17; Marcia
Baldwin, meza-soprano, Feb. 16; The
Carnegie String Quartet, April 18. A
sixth program will be announced.

Bela Szilagi was born in New
York City, March 1934, of Hungarian
desgeent. He began the study of piano
at nine, making his first public ap-
pearance when he was 12. He re-
ceived a scholarship from the Juil-
liard School of Music and studied
with Jane Carlson and Sascha Go-
rodnitzki.

In 1955, Mr. Szilagi toured the
United States as conductor for the
Medium and The Telephone, with
Marie Powers and Emmanuel Bala-
ban. The following year he toured
Europe with the violinist, Joyce
Flissler, performing more than 50
concerts.

By the unanimous decision of the
judges, in April 1960, he received
the Jugg Award, which was present-
ed in a Town Hall debut in March
1961.

wide diversity of subjects in this
Cincinnati collection. Among these
19 paintings are represented some
of the best of the painters of the
first quarter of this century.”

In addition to Chase and Davies,
the exhibition includes works by
Henry Mattson, Frank Benson, Emil
Bisttram, Robert D. Kaufman, David
Fredenthal, Buffie Johnson, Maxime
Maufra and others.

Plans for exhibitions in Washing-
ton and Lee’s duPont Art Gallery
have not yet been completed, Dr.
Junkin said.

 

Austrian Reaction To

Berlin Crisis Varies
(Continued from page 2)

with their view. “The Americans
could defend Berlin if they were
forced to. Anyway the Austrians are
not going to fight. We’re neutral
and I like it. We’re too small to play
an important role in world affairs,
and I don’t want to go to war for
anybody.”
U. S. Must Catch Up

A middle aged school teacher in
Vienna thinks that America must
“catch up” with the Russians before
we can make a forceful stand on
the Berlin issue.

In Rome a young Italian bartender
probably expressed the general
opinion of many Americans as well
as Europeans.

“Berlin, hell that’s a mess. Some-
thing’s got to be done, but what?
Who knows?

Paul States Objectives In Revamping Constitution

(Continued from page 1)

“My second objective was to im-
prove the prose of the constitution,
to write it on a more collegiate level.
I feel that our present constitution
does not express itself clearly and
with force.

“Finally, I felt that there were
several innovations which needed
to be made. The most important of
these are the adoption of a poll
tax, and the use of tests to determine
leadership ability.”

The proposed constitution would
have each student who desired vot-
ing privileges pay $2.00 when he
matriculated at the first of the year.
This money would then be refunded
when the student voted.

“This is not a tax, but a deposit.
Its sole purpose is to encourage
student interest in campus elections,”
said Paul.

Paul also proposes that tests be
used to judge a student’s qualifica-

 

Shenandoah To Appear

The Fall issue of Shenandoah, the
Washington and Lee literary maga-
zine, will concentrate on “the crea-
tive aspects of Southern fiction and
poetry,” according to Dr. Marshall
Fishwick, the editor of the current
issue.

The Fall issue, which is waiting to
be printed, will not be out for a few
weeks.

Thomas Russell, who is reference
librarian in the Cyrus McCormick
library here, has contributed a poem,
“Spengler Limited.”

Dr. Fishwick was assisted in the
editing of the current issue by
sophomore Robert Mottley, who has
contributed an essay on “Boris
Pasternak: The Late Phase.”

tions for office. These tests would be
used only as a further means to
judge a candidates ability, and would
not be a final authority.

“For two thousand years, men
have chosen their leaders on second-
hand information. Now, with ad-
vances in science, it seems that we
can use tests to improve our know-
ledge of a candidate’s abilities.

“In other words, there might be a
better way to elect officials, and this
could be it. It’s worth a try.”

 

Fall Debate Scheduled

(Continued from page 1)
will be debated by Washington and
Lee men in intercollegiate tourna-
ments.

Tentative contests for the W&L
team are set for Franklin and Mar-
shall College, Oct. 19-20; Univer-
sity of South Carolina, Nov. 9-11;
and a state tournament Nov. 17-18,
at Bridgewater, Va.

The debate team held its initial
meeting of the year Tuesday night
with a freshman-dominated turnout
of 48 students.

Mr. Chaffin, advisor to the debate
society, said he “hopes for” an ac-
tive membership of sixty students in
the group. Persons who did not at-
tend the organizational meeting may
see him in his office, Payne 32.

Tentative installation of a local
chapter of Tau Kappa Alpha, na-
tional debate fraternity, is scheduled
for Thursday, Nov. 2.
