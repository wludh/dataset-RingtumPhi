IFC President Says Fraternities
Only Get What They Ask For

To the Editor:

Last year, the LF.C. was called
the “Inert Fraternity Council” and
this week it was called a “do-noth-
ing” organization. I, for one, would
not say that these accusations are
unfounded but I certainly would say
they are unfair and illusionary. They
have turned the ILF.C. into a scape-
goat as an organization that is weak,
inert, and fumbling in the eyes of
many students, faculty, and the ad-
ministration. This is far from the
true picture of the Council.

I look at the IFC as an organiza-
tion created to function as a repre-
sentative body of the fraternity men
on our campus. In this capacity, the
IFC discusses topics which it and
its officers deem important, and con-
sequently establish and maintain
a set of policies related to these top-
ics. All policies adopted by the IFC

Fischer To Give
Geology Lecture

A member of the geology depart-
ment of Princeton Univ. will discuss
“Andean Landscapes and Geology”
in a public lecture tonight at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Dr. Alfred Fischer will give his
illustrated talk at 8 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium. His appearance is und-
er the sponsorship of W&L’s depart-
ment of geology and the American
Geological Institute.

He was also guest lecturer for
two geology classes this morning.

A native of Rothenburg, Germany,
Dr. Fischer was educated in the
United States. He received his bach-
elor of science degree from the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and his Ph.D.
from Columbia University.

He has taught at Virginia Poly-
technic Institute, the University of
Rochester and the University of
Kansas. He also has worked for the
Stanolind Oil Company in Kansas
and the International Petroleum
Company of Peru.

Dr. Fischer’s primary fields of
study are historical geology and in-
vertebrate paleontology. He is the
co-author of a textbook on paleon-
tology.

represent the majority of our fra-
ternities. The IFC was created
neither to pass down the opinions
of the administration nor to pass
mandate and shove them down the
throats of the fraternities. The
strength of the IFC stems from the
fact that its policies are the poli-
cies of the fraternities and as such
must receive fraternity support.

The faculty and the university
administration are above the IFC,
needless to say in absolute power,
and it is the IFC officers which real-
ize this more than anyone else.

However, in no case this year or
in past years has there been a pro-
posal made from the IFC adminis-~-
tration or from a particular IFC
committee in which the IFC’s of-
ficers did not feel the proposals to
be anything short of the best and
most constructive policy for the
Council, and consequently all 18
fraternities. The IFC is not an oli-
garchy as some things on this cam-
pus, rather, it is a democratic or-
ganization slow and easy to criticize.
Above all, it is not and will not be a
rubber stamp for the whims of “the
Hill.” The fact that “the Hill” ex-
presses their opinion on some mat-
ters and requests IFC action does not
mean the Council is weak and utter-
ly subservient. It is the IFC’s duty
to study and consider the faculty’s
requests, just as anything proposed
from within the IFC, is studied and
considered. Furthermore, in doing
this, “the Hill” is recognizing the
IFC’s power and sovereignty to take
action over fraternity matters.

The charge I never can under-
stand is that the IFC is weak. This
is because there is no defined limit
on the powers of the IFC over fra-
ternities. Also, by looking at the IFC
constitution and by-laws, we can see
some of the chief areas long given to
the IFC’s administration: rush week,
pledging, disputes among fraterni-
ties, scheduling and limiting of fra-
ternity social functions, and others.
The IFC’s Judicial Committee can
and would take away these privi-
leges from any fraternity when
deemed necessary—certainly, this is
no weak base.

From this base, though, the IFC
has taken actions which have been
weak. This is partly true, but let’s
look just at this year, and we can
see a changing attitude within the
IFC, and much of this change was
not due to faculty pressure at all.
Certainly, there was no faculty

 

pressure to have Dick Fletcher
speak to the compulsory IFC pledge
assembly. Also, the “watered-down”
Help Week proposals and the Help
Week Committee were of the IFC’s
own initiative and fortunately, the
proposals were watered down
enough to cause three houses to
abandon “Hell Week” altogether at
the time and several others to do the
same since then. No “Help Week”
was ever so mild or so constructive.
The IFC also passed legislation over
the pledge-training period, which
was an area never before covered
by the IFC. I fail to see with such
results as these that the IFC is al-
together weak in its action.

On the other hand, I will agree
with the Tuesday Edition that fra-
ternities should take more interest
in the IFC’s problems. The IFC is
hampered by apathetic and indif-
ferent members. I think a prime
example of this can be taken from
this past meeting where certain
members felt that to adopt the IFC
Social Committee’s proposal (work-
ed out in conjunction with the
Dance Board) would have limit-
ed what power the IFC had and
cause the IFC to become a rubber
stamp of the administration. In the
first place, the adoption of the pro-
posals would have greatly strength-
ened the IFC, and secondly, the pro-
posal was not from the administra-
tion or faculty (they had neither
seen it nor heard of it), but from
IFC members, officers, and the head
and co-head of the Dance Board
(both of whom are students and fra-
ternity men).

Attitudes of this type do greatly
hamper the I.F.C.—they are uncon-
structive and detrimental. What the
fraternity man must realize is that
the ILF.C. can do nothing without
support, which it has every right
to expect, despite failures. If fra-
ternities can continue in the con-
structive vein they are showing now,
the IFC will regain much lost pow-
er and find much new power. Espec-
ially important this Spring will be
the reconsideration of the combo
situation, and the all-important
Rush Week study. The LF.C. will
be able to attain constructive chang-
es or maintain a constructive sta-
tus quo, only if fraternity men are
willing to make the changes which
are in keeping with the general tem-

po of events on our campus inside, |

among, and outside of the fraterni-
ties.

Guard’s Quartet

Scheduled For Concert

 

Othello To Play
Wednesday Nite
Thru Saturday

Four performances of William
Shakespeare’s “Othello” will be
staged next week by members of the
Troubadour Theater.

The two and a half hour play will
run nightly Wednesday through Sat-
urday in the Troubadour Theater at
the edge of the campus. Curtain
time for each performance is 8:15
p.m.

A 25-member cast led by Lexing-
ton High School junior Lisa Tracy
as Desdemona and Washington and
Lee senior Robert Allen as Othello
will participate in the play under
the direction of Dr. Cecil D. Jones,
Jr., assistant professor of fine arts.
Both leading actors are Troubadour
Theater veterans.

Other principal actors include stu-
dents John Dunnell as Iago, Steve
Colvin as Cassio, Tim Morton as
Roderigo and Miss Josephine Un-
ger, a member of the faculty of
neighboring Southern Seminary, as
Emilia.

The principal actors for the trag-
edy have been preparing for over
two months, according to Dr. Jones.
Nightly rehearsals with the full cast
have been underway for five weeks.

A six-foot extension has been
built on the front of the regular
Troudabour Theater stage for act-
ors’ use during soliloquies and two-
character scenes. Stage coloring has
been kept neutral to enhance the 32
Italian Renaissance costumes on or-
der from a New York costume
house. Part of the “Othello” cos-
tumes are designed from sketches
by Robert Edmond Jones, a leading
theatrical designer.

“One of the most difficult prob-
lems in producing a Shakespearean
tragedy is that of speaking verse
and recreating of strong and pas-
sionate human emotions so that they
are believable for the audience,” Dr.
Jones said.

“Beyond our work with the prin-
cipal actors, we encounter the prob-
lem of integrating the work of a
cast of 25 so that they all are striv-
ing for a common goal throughout
the play,” the director said.

Reservations for performances of
“Othello” may be made by calling
HO 3-2181, etx. 273, between 2-5
p.m. or 6-8 p.m. any day starting
tonight.

Troup publicity director Andy
Leonard says that any freshman or
sophomores interested in working on
the Theatre business staff should re-
port to the Theatre tonight at 7:30
p.m.

 

Report Says Zimmerman
Died of Natural Causes;
Funeral Is Tomorrow

Medical officials said today that
Washington and Lee University
senior John Louis Zimmerman, who
was found dead in his dormitory
room Wednesday, died of natural
causes.

The natural causes opinion was is-
sued by Dr. Frederick A. Fedde-
man, Lexington medical examiner.

Zimmerman, who lived in Glen-
dale, Ohio, was found dead Wed-
nesday evening in his room in Bak-
er Dormitory by two of his fratern-
ity brothers after he was missed at
the regular evening meal at the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house.

A funeral service will be held Sat-
urday at 10 a.m. from the First Pres-
byterian Church in Glendale. Burial
will follow in Glendale’s Oak Hill
Cemetery. Dean of Students Edward
C. Atwood, Jr., will represent Wash-
ington and Lee at the funeral.

Zimmerman is survived by his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Wil-
liam Zimmerman, and a sister, all
of Glendale.

An Air Force officer selection
team will be in the Co-op Monday
and Tuesday to interview seniors
interested in an Air Force Com-
mission.

 

By STEVE SMITH

Dave Guard’s Whiskeyhill Singers will be featured at the
Saturday night concert of Springs weekend, Dance Set Presi-

dent Steve Galef said today.

 

The new quartet was formed by*
Guard a few months after his split
with the Kingston Trio of which
he was leader. The Whiskeyhill
Singers have been touring north-
eastern schools for the last few
months, and, according to Galef,
have been met with sellout audi-
ences.

The singing of Guard, who is a
leading exponent of genuine folk
music, is in line with the Dance
Board’s experiment in bringing folk
music to W&L, said Galef.

If the Springs folk music week-
end goes over, a Folk Music Festi-
val may be held here next October.

Talented Group

Guard picked the other members
of the quartet with the object of
forming a group which shared his
own ideas about folk music. The
first to join him was twenty-five
year-old Cyrus Faryar, singer-gui-
tarist-banjoist.

Faryar was a schoolmate of Guard
in Honolulu, although he was born
in Teheran, Iran, of Persian-English
parents. Guard tracked him to a
Phoenix coffee house to recruit him.

Next, Guard signed Victor Baciga-
lupi, 37 years of age. Bacigalupi is
a Stanford graduate who studied
music on a Ford Fellowship Foun-
dation scholarship at San Francis-
co State. He is a bassist, but is also
proficient on the guitar and gitarron
(Mexican bass). Guard hooked him
with the promise of making him
singer in the new group.

 

Judy Henske was recruited from
an Oklahoma City coffee house;
she had just begun to make a name
in folk singing and was at first re-
luctant to join the group. She per-
forms with the six string guitar,
banjo, tambourine, and autoharp in
addition to singing. She is a 23 year-
old brunette.

Debut on Feb. 1

The Whiskeyhill Singers made
their debut on Feb. 1 of this year.
They plan to publish their first al-
bum in about a month. The quartet
spent a great deal of time working
together before they stepped onto
the stage.

Commenting on his group, Guard
said, “Our music is designed for no
particular age group or segment
of the population. We hope every-
one likes it, but we’re not going to
adapt it to usit any fad or aim for
any ‘market’ in particular.

The leader stresses the point of
good music, for it his belief that a
performer can neither underesti-
mate the American public, nor lec-
ture to it, and that the public, in
the long run, will never fully accept
so-called “commercial music” from
top artists.

He also called his singers “a new
and different sound,” and “exciting.”
The quartet will perform from

8 to 10 o’clock on Saturday night
of Springs, April 14.

 

ROTC Seniors Learn Branches;
Thirty-One Seeking Deferments

Washington and Lee’s 55 seniors in Army ROTC have received their
branch assignments for their tour of active duty. All will serve two years.
Of the seniors, 31 have asked for deferment of their active duty in
order to go on to graduate study. According to Major A. J. Moller of the
ROTC department, it is likely that only those seniors going on to study
medicine, law, or psychology will get their deferments.
Below is a list of the seniors and their branch assignments. Active duty

begins on the date listed. The rest of

the seniors who have not asked for

deferments should get their orders for active duty within the month.

Constitutional Changes

The Executive Committee, to nobody’s disappointment,
has voted to ask the student body to approve a constitutional
amendment doing away with the nominating convention for
student body officers. According to the new amendment can-
didates will have to present a petition signed by 150 of their
fellow students in order to get their name on the ballot.

The 150-signature requirement is good in that it assures
that a man has substantial support for an office and still makes
it possible for third or even fourth candidates, to run for office.
The EC will schedule a voluntary assembly every spring for
candidates to present their views and such platforms as they

have.

We are pleased that the movement to remove the Publi-
cations Board representative from the EC has so far failed
The close vote (supporters of the amendment failed to get
their two-thirds majority by one vote) is hardly a vote of con-
fidence in the Publications Board. But we know of no better
way to assure a strong and experienced EC than the present
method. We are not surprised that the EC has been unable to
find a substitute satisfactory to two-thirds of the Committee.

Other changes are very useful simplifications of the consti-
tution which bring it more in line with actual student govern-
ment practice. We'll discuss them when the EC releases their
final draft of their proposed changes. Then it will be up to the
student body to pass the new constitution by a simple majority.

Facing A Complex Problem

It has been said many times before, but we will say it again:
the threat of atomic war hovers over our civilization like an
impersonal god, threatening wanton, amoral destruction, and
pervading our society with a sense of hopelessness and indiffer-
ence. The tremendous moral questions posed by the advent of
nuclear weapons are the great problems of our generation, and
they will continue to be for a long time.

Bill Lowry is attempting to cope with this subject in the cur-
rent issues of Protest, and two columns on the ramifications
of nuclear disarmament appear in today’s Ring-tum Phi. We
urge that our readers study these opinions. We owe it to our-
selves to give them our attention.

 

Fraternity Responsibility

The Tuesday Edition’s attack on the IFC was justified
to some extent, but the blame for that group’s relative inaction
must be thrown back on the University’s fraternity men. For
the IFC has been accurate in their representation of the fra-
ternities’ viewpoint. They have done nothing except when
forced to. This is certainly not the fault of the IFC itself, nor
of the IFC officers, who have been trying for the past several
years to initiate some useful changes. They have gotten no
support whatsoever from the fraternity rank-and-file.

What the fraternity men at W&L must realize is that they
have a personal responsibility for the entire fraternity system
here. If they are too lazy to make some well-considered changes
they deserve to be regulated more closely from the Hill. We
have always championed the right of the students to live their
own lives with a minimum of regulation. But this right implies
a responsibility to respect the viewpoint of the faculty and

administration.

We believe in a strong fraternity system. But the power of
the fraternities will have to be limited if they insist on working,
consciously or not, against the larger goals of the University.
We think this is now the case in some houses, with respect to
their members’ studies and their finances.

IT'WO OPINIONS ON NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT

 

Harrington: Use Common Sense

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Colleges and crusades just seem to
naturally go together—and Wash-
ington and Lee is no exception. The
latest and loudest campus cam-
paign concerns neither student gov-
ernment nor social fraternities—it’s
a ban-the-bomb movement.

Chief promoter of peace and pro-
mulgator of nuclear horror is Protest
editor Bill Lowry. Lowry, who says
he has hardly gotten the program
started, already has a_ substantial
following. In several articles and
posters he has said, basically, what
most people already know: that a
nuclear war would be devastating to
the human race. He paints vivid pic-
tures of nuclear war, and succeeds
in convincing his readers that uni-
lateral disarmament would be great.

Admittedly, Lowry doesn’t know
exactly how to go about it. “But
something has to be done, and our
job now is to find out what’s going
on.” Agreed. But how can we be

Behind The News

There is a movement afoot in the
EC to make the office of president
of the IFC a position elected by the
entire student body.

There are also members who
would like to see the offices of
Dance Set President abolished. They
propose that the presidents of the
four undergraduate classes serve as
chairmen of the four weekends, ar-
guing that the present system is in-
efficient, and merely a political con-
venience.

sure or even suppose that nuclear
disarmament is a feasible solution?

Russian Score: 33 for 33

Lowry seems to think our atti-
tude towards the Russians is too
hostile. He suggests that perhaps
they aren’t really out for world
domination, but just for technologi-
cal or ideological domination. I sug-
gest that this is as bad—if not worse
—than military domination. He sug-
gests, further, that we have to trust
the Russians more. I suggest, furth-
er, that the Russians, in the realm of
political conflicts, have given us
every reason not to trust them. (Ac-
cording to one source, the Russians

have made 33 treaties since World
War I and have broken 33 treaties
since World War I.)

Several points seem to have been
omitted in Lowry’s arguments. What
guarantee do we have that, should
we disarm, Russia would follow
suit? Mutual inspection arrange-
ments would help, but what about
all those nasty little bombs that
are already made and stacked neatly
away in a Siberian warehouse some-
where? It seems a bit naive to sup-
pose that Russia—or the United
States either, for that matter—would
refrain from using nuclear weap-
ons should they be on the losing side
in the crucial days of a hot war.
Lowry has flagrantly dismissed
such concepts as limited warfare, the
so-called “balance of terror,” and
massive retaliation. As far as limit-
ed warfare is concerned, he said he
doesn’t believe the human race in-
telligent enough to refrain from us-
ing weapons if they have them—

 

even if the authorities concerned
realize the destructive powers of
such weapons. I wonder, then, why
he assumes they have the intelli-
gence to arrive at satisfactory dis-
armament agreements?

“Something Has To Be Done”

The most significant comment
Lowry has made so far is that
“something has to be done.” Of
course, he doesn’t know what has
to be done. No one else does, eith-
er. The truth of the matter seems to
be that humanity has overstepped
itself. Surely, the prospect of war
with today’s weapons is horrible. I
share with Lowry the aversion for
two-headed grandchildren. War, es-
pecially modern nuclear war, is a
frightening prospect. Lowry has
achieved one rather dubius thing—
he has called to our attention just
how pleasant a future we have to
look forward to. Unfortunately, dis-
armament is extremely unlikely to
rise as the answer to nuclear war.
In my opinion, the only way man
will ever be made to do away with
nuclear war is to have one; and, if
he manages to avoid rotting to death
from radiation, is able to scrounge
enough uncontaminated food out of
garbage cans, he can try to salvage
the few worthwhile aspects of “civi-
lization” and think twice before he
splits any more atoms.

Until that time, we can listen to
editor Lowry, hope that the impos-
sible will come true, and try to be-
lieve that Khrushchey, Kennedy,
and the rest of our destiny-shapers
have brains enough to keep their
fingers off the buttons.

Slater: It's Worth A Try

By HOWARD SLATER

To believe, as most of us do, that
man is “captain of his fate” is to
affirm an essential feature of West-
ern civilization. Western thought
has not been as naive as to deny
the significance of the environmental
influence upon man’s situation, but
there is an obvious distinction be-
tween determinism and _ fatalism;
and so it is asserted that men do
have control over their individual
destinies, however limited this con-
trol may be.

Why then is it true that men
choose to be like cattle, and reject
their right and their responsibility,
to exercise this control? (There is
a possible answer to this question
which may not be at all flattering
to some cows I know.) Has there
ever been a time when the majority
of men have taken it upon them-
selves to be the arbiters of their
own fate? These times must have
been few and far between.

Certainly, this is not one of them.
And how utterly horrible that
thought is! For now is the time
when the fates of all men are at

a more critical turning-point than
ever before. There can be no doubt
about that. We have the bombs and
missiles to prove it. How, then, are
we reacting to the problem in this
outpost of civilization? The answer
is fairly obvious, and bears a strong
relation to the major form of econ-
omic activity in this beef and dairy
district.
Who To Believe?

There is a certain amount of jus-
tification for this reaction. The ov-
erall problem, which includes the
questions of nuclear testing, the
arms race, disarmament, and fall-
out shelters, is riddled through and
through with seemingly insoluble
conflicts. For instance, it is impos-
sible to know who to believe, those
who say that there will be total
destruction of the human race as a
result of radiation, or those who say
that the results of radiation will be
practically nil.

But because a question or set of
questions is complex, does not mean
that we ought not to tackle them.
Besides, there is a rule of thumb

Alumnus Calls
Faculty Petition

Socialist Move

To the Editor:

This letter is to oppose delayed
rushing, which the faculty petition
claims will cure everything from
maladjusted freshmen to some of
the University’s complex problems.

W&L is, and has been, a very
strong fraternity college for over
100 years. Prospective students
know that pledging takes place the
first week of school and they are
affiliated with a fraternity, if they
want to join one, for the full four
years of college. I assume that if
some boys and their parents don’t
like our system, they would go else-
where.

Part of the faculty, 1962 model,
apparently thinks it detects reasons
for making a drastic change in our
fraternity operation. I suggest that
the faculty restrict its efforts to the
purpose for which it was hired—
teaching—and if it likes the system
better elsewhere, to kindly pack up
and leave.

The generalities advanced as rea-
sons for promoting this change are
misleading, irrelevant, and irrespon-
sible. In short, they are merely a
cover for what is really intended:
the elimination of fraternities.

For the vast majority of W&L stu-
dents, the fraternity is a good thing
and just as important a part of edu-
cation as books, classes, examina-
tions. The few students who don’t
make the grade due solely to the
fraternity to which they belong cer-
tainly are insufficient justification
to stifle or eliminate an institution
that provides such multiple advan-
tages to all the rest.

This is definitely a move to stifle
fraternities and if it is not defeated,
it can easily result in the complete
elimination of fraternities at W&L.
You may not know that there is a
strong socialistic sentiment running
in academic circles to eliminate fra-
ternities because (1) fraternities are
a bastion of conservative thinking
and influence, (2) fraternities with
their selective membership are in
opposition to the socialistic-minded
group who are ramming integration
down our throats, and (3) fraterni-
ties permit and encourage individ-
ualism which is in opposition to the
welfare state concept (the last step
before the socialistic state).

The college fraternity typifies the
free enterprise, individualism, and
spirit that is America. Step by step
emasculation of this American in-
stitution is what socialists, commun-
ists, and the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People want. Any one step now is
merely a future invitation to anoth-
er step.

W&L is standing firm against ac-
cepting general Federal aid because
of the dangers of paternalistic gov-
ernment. For the same reasons W&L
must encourage in every way the

Southern Writers Continue In Vital Faulkner Tradition

By James Boatwright, III
Instructor In English

The title of this series cannot in
all fairness apply to this particular
article. One can with some accuracy
estimate the population of Norfolk
in 1965; but there is no way of
knowing the course that literature
will take, literature of the South or
anywhere else. Nor is the specula-
tion interesting; what is interesting
and valuable is the literature we
have, the novels and poems and
plays that are part of the past and
the present. The literature of the
future we can leave to the future.

The question that is worth asking
is whether there is a vital tradition
in Southern letters today. We know
of the recent past, of Faulkner’s
greatest books, of Thomas Wolfe, of
the Agrarians. We are often told,
however, that the spirit that inspired
these writers and movements has
dissipated; the South will soon be
like the North, perhaps worse. The
social structure is changing, the
farms have been abandoned, indus-
tries are moving in and bringing
with them unionism, decent wages
and other such evils. The Southern

 

writers of today, or so we are led to
believe, inevitably reflect this
change; they are more concerned
with Freud and city planning than
with their souls and their crops.

Distorted Generalization

Such generalizations are danger-
ous because they are distorted. The
implications are that the writer is
completely the creature of his en-
vironment, and that that environ-
ment has undergone an overnight
metamorphosis. In answer to the
first, I would say that a writer is
much more than his environment,
that he has memory and imagination,
intellect and will; and he can adapt
as well as any animal. As for the
metamorphosis, the only person who
would believe that the South is not
still, in innumerable painful and
blessed ways, the South (despite
many vast changes) has simply not
lived in the South and used his eyes
and ears.

Several years ago, in separate es-
says, R. B. Heilman and Richard
Weaver isolated the salient charac-
teristics of the Southern temper,
particularly the temper of the writ-

 

er, and these characteristics hold
true for the writers of today. (It is
not likely that the Southerner will
be radically different tomorrow or
ten years from now; a temper is not
put down so easily.) Southern writ-
ing is marked by a sense of the con-
crete; the prose shows the influence
of political and pulpit rhetoric and it
shows affinities with the adecdotes
and with gossip. The total view of
life is often informed by religious
feeling and an awareness of trag-
edy. Not that non-Southern writers
might not share these feelings and
attitudes; but the Southern writer
is endowed with them according to
a particular, identifiable balance.

This temper is evident, for in-
stance, in the playwright Tennessee
Williams. Williams, for all his fash-
ionable commercial qualities, seems
to me an essentially Southern writ-
er. His best plays—A Streetcar
Named Desire; Suddenly, Last Sum-
mer; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof—de-
rive their strength from the atmos-
phere of decay and the perverted
idealism which are at least a part
of Southern life.

The novelists who use the South

 

as subject are more numerous, and
they use it in various ways. Carson
McCuller’s studies in loneliness, iso-
lation, and the need for love are
honest and painful reflections of
Southern experience. Frankie in The
Member of the Wedding records as
faithfully as Holden Caulfield the
peculiar joys and sorrows of grow-
ing up. In The Heart Is a Lonely
Hunter, Reflections in a Golden Eye,
and many of the shorter works the
dumb, the dwarfed, and the mad are
heightened, exaggerated metaphors;
their lives are ours, as Southerners
and human beings.

God Denied Or Transformed

The grotesque of Mrs. McCullers’
books are similar to the strange,
possessed country people found in
Flannery A’Connor’s two novels and
collection of stories: Wise Blood, The
Violent Bear It Away, A Good Man
Is Hard to Find. The difference is
that Miss O’Connor’s characters live
in a world of heroic and demonic
evil, a world in which God has been
denied or transformed into a funda-
mentalist God of anger and destruc-
tion. It is not a comfortable or pop-

 

ular view of life, but it is expressed
with an absolute and convincing
skill. The fact that as rationalists we
reject such a dark world indicates
all too well our place in that world.

A more realistic, commonplace
South appears in the novels of Wil-
liam Styron, a Virginian, whose first
book, Lie Down in Darkness, met
with great critical success. It is a
moving and tragic story of the life
of a Virginia family, but his second
long work, Set This House on Fire
(1960) is an even finer achievement
and is suggestive of the way in
which some Southern writers have
found to use their past. The setting
of Set This House on Fire is Italy
for the most part; the story is in
many ways a re-telling of the Don
Juan legend; the suffering of the
characters is overtly existential. But
the main characters are Southern-
ers, and their suffering and search
are strongly conditioned by their
Southern background.

Yet further evidence of the con-
tinuing vitality of Southern writing
can be found in the work of Rey-
nolds Price, who represents a new
generation, but whose first novel

 

shows the same feeling for language
and rhetoric, for place and charac-
ter, as the works of his distinguished
predecessors. A Long and Happy
Life will be published this month
simultaneously in hardcover and as
a supplement in Harper’s. It is a love
story, set in rural North Carolina,
a story of birth and death, of sorrow
and happiness.

In The Southern Tradition

It stands securely in a great tra-
dition in American letters, the tra-
dition of the South. As do most
of the works in that tradition, it
shows close observation of the con-
crete and tangible; it is a novel of
emotion, not of ideology. Its view of
life is pathetic, if not tragic; but the
tragedy and the pathos are always
touched by the comic. Finally, it
extends its meaning beyond region-
al bounds, and achieves the univer-
sality of art.

Doubtlessly there is much in the
South in need of change, much that
is cause for shame; but there is also
cause for pride, particularly pride
in its literature, both past and pres-
ent.

- Robrecht Fights For Roanoke
PAL Against Marines Monday

Ray Robrecht, Washington and Lee’s only boxer-in-resi-*
dence, will be shooting for his 12th straight win Monday night
when the Roanoke Police Athletic League boxers meet the
Camp Lejune Marines in Roanoke.

The 12-bout card begins at 8:30 in the Roanoke National
Guard Armory. Admission is $2 for ringside, and $1.50 gen-

eral admission.

The Roanoke PAL has a string of 26 straight wins going
into the Lejune match, including five over the Quantico Mar-
ines. But Robrecht says that Monday’s match will be against
“the toughest opposition we’ve met yet.”

The Lejune Marines are the Corps’ top boxing outfit.
Robrecht, a middleweight, will be facing Sam Sloan, who’s
ranked near the top in Marine Corps middleweight fighting.

 

Began in 56

Robrecht, the first serious W&L
boxer in recent years, didn’t get
interested in fighting until the sum-
mer of his senior year in high
school,

That’s when he started working
out in a Plainfield, New Jersey,
gymnasium, and slowly became not
only a fight fan, but also a fighter.

When he came to W&L in the fall
of 1956, he found an athletic pro-

gram that was still competing
against major university competi-
tion.

“T had played football and baseball
in high school,” said Robrecht, “but
I just didn’t have it against those
big schools. I was a lineman in high
school, but how much ball can a
160-pound lineman play against
big schools?”

Robrecht didn’t have much to do
with athletics in Virginia until the
spring of his freshman year.

'|been highly successful, defeating
‘|three straight opponents from
Quantico.

Then he wrote the Roanoke Times
and asked if there were any places
nearby where he could do a little
boxing. When they told him about
the highly organized PAL facilities
in Roanoke, Robrecht had found an
organization that appreciates his
talents in the ring.

He fought his first PAL fight in
1957, winning by a TKO. Since then,
he’s fought eight PAL-sponsored
fights, and won all of them.

Also, he picked up a Virginia
Golden Gloves championship in
1959.

Robrecht has been working out for
five weeks in preparation for Mon-
day night’s fight.

“That’s serious. training, of
course,” he said. “I try to stay in
pretty good shape all the time so I
won't have to push too hard before
my fights.”

Robrecht’s training preparation
includes two and a half miles of
roadwork every morning, and an
hour and a half workout in the gym
during the afternoon.

Sparring partners at W&L are
hard to find, but Robrecht has been
stepping into the handball courts
with two students, Dick Rose and
Jim Hague.

Rose, a law student, boxed at
Cornell in his undergraduate days,
and also did some armed forces box-
ing. Hague, a junior Phi Gam has
done a little boxing, but has never
fought in an organized match.

Never KO’d

In his 11-win string, Robrecht has
never been knocked down. He’s
scored three knockouts himself,
however.

Against Marine opposition, he’s

Monday night will be his tough-
est test so far, though. If he sur-
vives that one, he can start looking
forward to his next fight, an April
14 meeting with Richmond’s Billy
Crowder in the annual Sportsman
Show held in the VMI fieldhouse.

 

 

March 17 ts
Date For I-M
Track Meet

The Intra-Mural track meet will
be held on March 17, it was an-
nounced yesterday by track coach
Norm Lord.

Lord said that the I-M meet was
being held in the spring this year
instead of in the fall as has been
the practice in recent years.

This change was made in order to
make the meet coincide with spring
track at W&L.

If Weather Permits

If weather permits, the meet will
be held outdoors. In case of bad
weather, the meet will take place in
the VMI field house under the su-
pervision of Coach Norm Lord and
I-M manager Joe Spivey.

Lord said that each participant in
the meet must get in at least three
pledged practices before the 17th.
In order to get recognition for prac-
tices, the entrant must contact eith-
er Lord or the track manager at
either 3, 4 or 5 p.m.

Certain time and distance require-
ments must also be fulfilled before
6 p.m., Thursday, March 15, under
the direction of either Coach Lord,
Coach McLaughlin, or Coach Rob-
erts.

They'll practice every morning in
preparation for the game against
Coach Bob McHenry’s Generals. The
W&L game will be the third outing
for the Aussies on their American
tour. Earlier, they'll meet Virginia
and Duke.

This is the first time that an Aus-
tralian lacrosse team has played in
America.

Before coming down to play the
University of Virginia on the 16th,
the team will travel to Washington
and meet President Kennedy and
other White House officials.

All the Australian players are
amateurs. Their occupations in or-
dinary life range from land survey-
ing to stock exchange operators to
motor mechanics. There’s even a
wholesale jeweller on the squad. All
of them are strictly amateurs.

Slater Wants Moderate Approach To Disarmament

(Continued from page 2)
which may be followed with great
advantage oversimplification
though it may be. It is this: Truth, if
it is discernible at all, is usually to
be found somewhere in between two
conflicting points of view. I think
this is extremely applicable to the
anomolies of the cold war.

In the case of fallout shelters, ra-
diation may very well be as deadly
a weapon as is claimed—but surely
some lives may be saved through
shelter protection, and isn’t this
possibility worth taking into ac-
count? The truth here is that we
must not downgrade the horror
which nuclear war will bring, but
we must not put our eggs in one
basket and assume that nothing can
be done if an all-out war is begun.

In the case of disarmament, it
may very well be that effective in-
spection procedures can never be
adequately established; but this
does not invalidate the truth, which
is that disarmament is of itself an
infinitely desirable goal. We should
not assume that disarmament can
never be accomplished, simply be-

cause there are practical difficulties
of inspection. Disarmament will be
much more effective if it is based on
good will and a rational decision
to survive, made even by those we
consider to be implacable enemies.
Many Americans’ realize that
their destinies are wrapped up in
those of the Russian people; why
can’t many Russians have reached
the same conclusion?

In short, I am urging that we do
begin finally to take some interest
in this most important problem.
Why, for instance, the faculty has
neglected its obligation to teach
and be itself concerned with an
awareness of this issue is not under-
standable.

And I am urging that we adopt
some moderate approach to the is-
sue both because it will facilitate a
reconciliation between those who
are already concerned and working
to concern others, and because it
comes closer to the truth which we

freedom of choice, freedom of gov-

encourage fraternities because the

It is interesting to note that the
same faculty which is now promot-

so:

(1) wanted to invite Martin Luth-
