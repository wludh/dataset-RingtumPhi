EC Will Study New Constitution

The first draft of a proposed
constitution for Washington and
Lee’s Student Body was present-
ed to the Executive Committee for
further study at last night’s EC
meeting.

Presented by the EC’s Sub-
Committee on Constitution Re-
forms, the proposed constitution
includes some of the reform which
were submitted to the EC earlier
this year.

The new constitution, as was
presented by the sub-committee,
would include the following major
changes:

1. A new method of electing of-
ficers, by means of changing the
criterium for candidacy for a Stu-
dent Body office.

2. A partial re-vamping of rep-
resentation to the Executive Com-
mittee.

The new constitution proposes
that the method of electing of-

ficers of the Student Body be

changed. The draft states:

Candidates shall be chosen in
the following manner: any student
desiring to place his name in can-
didacy for a Student Body office
or position of honor as previous-
ly defined shall present to the Exec-
utive Committee a petition bearing
a minimum of fifty signatures and
a statement of the position for
which he wishes his name placed
in the candidacy.

Here-to-fore, candidates were
selected by means of a nominat-
ing convention held annually in
Lee Chapel. At that time, the po-
litical parties would present their
candidates for nomination.

resentation, the new constitution
calls for (1) the elimination of
the representative from the Pub-
lications Board (2) the elimination
of one of the two representatives
from the Senior Class, and (3) the
addition of two representatives to
be chosen from the Student Body
at large.

The remainder of the proposed
changes presented in the suggest-
ed constitution are only of a min-
or nature..

“These changes, Student Body
President Uncas McThenia said,
“only encompass the elimination
of a lot of unnecessary words.”

The other changes, he said, are
designed to streamline the Con-

ese

stitution, by including sections
under single topics, rather than
under several headings.

Secretary of the Student Body
Steve Suttle told the Ring-tum
Phi last night that the new draft
envisioned changes only up to
Section VIII of the old Constitu-
tion.

Members of the EC will study
the constitution this week, and
will discuss additional suggestions
and changes at next week’s meet-
ing, he added.

Before any plan is submitted to
voting, McThenia stated, an open
forum will be held for interested
persons, at which time the issues
will be discussed by the EC. Stu-

ES:

+

dents will be allowed to ask ques-
tions about the proposed changes
during the forum.

The first three articles, Suttle
said, will be voted on by the EC
first. (These sections contain the
clauses that would change voting
and nominating procedures.)

“By no means,” McThenia em-
phasized, “does the presentation
of the first draft by the Sub-
Committee of the EC mean that
the EC will adopt the proposed
constitution as it now stands.

The EC members will come back
next week, and at that time will
make suggestions for future revi-
sions and for additional changes.”

The EC will vote on the new

pia anne cne cece anececaaee aceon

   

constitution, he added, only after
careful consideration is given to
additional suggestions received by
the EC.

After hearing proposed changes,
and suggestions, he continued, the
EC will then vote whether or not
to accept the new constitution.

Following the EC’s vote (if affir-
mative) the constitution will then
be presented to the Student Body
in the form of a genereal referen-
dum.

The details of the referendum,
McThenia_ said, will be an-
nounced at a later time.

Due to the limited amount of
space available in today’s paper,
it was physically impossible to
reprint the entire proposed con-
stitution.

“It is our hope,” he added,
“that the Ring-tum Phi can per-
haps print the entire article in

the future, but limited space pre-
vents such printing today.”

School Offers New Sociology Major For ’

Sen. Gore Opens Internatioal Relations Week Tonight

Leyburn To Head Department;

Courses Added

To Curriculum

BY STEVE GUILD

Executive News Editor

A new major in sociology and anthropology will be offered

at Washington and Lee beginni
today. Several new courses will

ng next fall, it was announced

be added to those already of-

fered by the department next year and additional ones will be

offered the following year.

The sociology and anthropology major will fill the gap that
has existed in the field of social sciences at the University.

The major will require 18 hours of work in the department
above the introductory courses, Social Anthropology (Soci-
ology 101) and General Sociology (Sociology 102).

Professor James G. Leyburn will*
be the head of the department and
will continue to teach his courses
in Anthropology and General So-
ciology.

In addition, next year he will
teach Religion and Society, and
Africa South of the Sahara.

In the fall of 1963, he will begin
teaching two additional courses,
Race and Comparative Cultures. Dr.
Leyburn will continue to teach his
courses in Ancient History and
Greek and Latin Classics, but will
drop the course Introduction to Po-
litical Science.

Professor Marshal Fishwick will
continue teaching the courses in
Cultural Regions of the United
States and Society and Thought in
America.

Several new courses, however,
will be added to the department.

A new man, who will join the
faculty next September, will teach
courses in The City, Population, So-
cial Institutions, Seminar in Soci-
ology Theory, and the Individual
in Society.

In addition to these courses, Pro-
fessor Westbrook Barritt will teach a
course in Structural Linguistics..

The course will be centered around
the study of the nature of language,
how it is composed, and how it is a
symbolic activity of man. This will be
the only course that Dr. Barritt will
teach in the new department.

Dr. Leyburn’s course in Africa
South of the Sahara will deal with
that portion of Africa, its life and cul-
ture, and its relationship to the pres-
ent-day world.

In the fall of 1963, three new courses
wil be added to the department which
will bring the total to 17.

These will be Dr. Leyburn’s Race
and Comparative Cultures courses and
the new faculty member’s course,
Methods in Sociology. There will also
be Senior Thesis, a course which will
be for honors work.

In general, there will be nine new
courses added next year in the de-
partment and four the following year
plus the Senior Thesis course. The
courses below 250 generally will be

 

 

for juniors or below, while courses
numbered 250 and above will be prin-
cipally senior level work.

A comprehensive examination,
which will be given at the end of the
senior year will be required of all ma-
jors in sociology and anthropology.

Crenshaw Replaces Bean As History Head

By ANDY NEA
Managing Editor

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw has
been appointed as head of the
department of history to suc-
ceed Dr. William G. Bean, it
was announced today by Dean
of the College, William W.
Pusey.

Dr. Crenshaw’s appoint-
ment is effective upon the re-
tirement of Dr. Bean from this
position in June.

This is the first change concerning
the head of the history department
since 1930, when Dr, Bean assumed
the position.

Dr. Crenshaw came to Washington
and Lee as an instructor of history in
1926. He was made a full professor in
1947 and has served in that capacity
since that time.

Dr. Crenshaw was born in College

Park, Md., in 1904. He received an|

A.B. and an A.M. from Washington
and Lee. He was awarded a Ph.D.
from Johns Hopkins.

Dr. Crenshaw is a member of the
Virginia Association of Social Sciences
and the Maryland Historical Society.
He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

Dr. Bean came to Washington and
Lee as an assistant professor of history
in 1922.

In 1929 he was made professor of
history and in 1930 he was named
chairman of the department.

In 1947 he was named Professor of

History of the Thomas Ball Founda-
tion.

Bill Noell Named Best Debater
At King’s College Tournament

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associate Editor
Topping a field of 136 contestants, Bill Noell, Washington
and Lee sophomore from West Virginia was named best de-

| bater at the King’s College Debate Tournament held this week-

‘and at Wilkes-Barre, Penn.

— : *
In winning the title, Noell earned

| 111 points out of a possible 125 for the
| five debates he took part in. He edged
|out his nearest competitor, a student
| from Augustana College, by one point.

“We were very fortunate, indeed,”
Noell said. “This was perhaps the
toughest tournament I have even tak-
en part in.

“It was what is known as a strength
meets strength tournament. That is
winning teams meet only winning
teams and losing teams meet losing
teams,” he said.

The negative team composed of
Noelll and Al Eckes was undefeated.
None of the other 67 teams at the
meet matched this record.

 

 

up the affirmative team, compiled a
2-5 record.

As a whole the W&L team finished
fourth at the 12th annual tournament.
Augustana, Scranton, and Dartmouth
took the three top positions,

In the coming two weeks the team
will take part in two more debate con-
tests and will hold a demonstration
debate for a nearby high school.

On Wednesday they will be in
Blacksburg to meet the VPI debate
team, and on Feb. 23 they will take
part in the Mt. Mercy Debate Tourna-
ment in Pittsburgh, Penn.

Monday will see the team appearing
before a Roanoke high school. Wash-
ington and Lee was asked by the

emy of Social Sciences, and Phi Beta
Kappa.

Under the direction of Dr. Bean,
the department of history has been
expanded and broadened. The in-
structors in the department have
been increased considerably over the
years.

In the Twenties Washington and
Lee’s history department consisted
of but three full time professors.
Today the department is made up
of eight full time professors and
two part time instructors.

The curriculum has been modi-
fied and expanded. The department
offers majors in American History,
European History, and in the recent-

| ly added field of Contemporary Civi-
| lization.

While the department has always
been strong in the field of American
History, considerable advances have
been made in other areas. European
history has received much attention
and new courses have been offered
in this field.

In addition such courses as Modern
Russian History, the History of
the Near East, and Latin American
History have been added.

Since the end of the Second World
War, the curriculum has been ex-
panded and broadened.

In addition, the History Depart-
ment has been active in the field of
senior honors work. Each year there
are participants in this field.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

By DR. CHARLES W. TURNER
Professor of History

The nations watch with excit-
ment the current rift between the
Soviet Union and Communist
China. Especially since 1958, a
number of points of disagreement
have developed in the “Leaning-
to-One Side Policy” forged be-
tween the two powers in the
Treaty of Alliance and Friendship
of thirty years duration made in
1950. This had come after “Mao-
ism” had claimed the mainland
from the Kuomintang Party. The
point made, at the time of the
signing, that is marked a high
point in a long courtship that had
its beginning with the signing of
the Nerchinsky Treaty of 1689.
The latter had been another “first”
for Russia in that she was the first
European power to make a treaty

 

with China. If one looks more
closely in the period 1689-1950
there will be found many instances
where their courtship ador had
cooled. Such time as when, in the
late 19th century, Russia tried to
cut a “sphere of influence” in
North China using a “railroad
right-of-way sovereignty” tech-
nique. Everywhere railroad spikes
were driven down Russian politi-
cal sovereignty was exerted. A
second distance, when Stalin sup-
ported Li Li-san’s type of com-
munism as against that of Mao’s
in Yenan in the 1930’s. To make
his support more confusing why
did he agree to the Soong-Molotov
Agreement of 1946? To be sure,
the last might have been “zig-
zag” game ait its best.

The spirit of cooperation reached
a peak by 1958. In the period of

1950-’58 both sides lauded each
other in flowery terms. The treaty
of 1950 contained Russian prom-
ises of military, economic and cul-
tural aid to China. Spelt out this
aid meant the sending of some
11,000 engineers, a student ex-
change program, a _  $300,000,000
at 1%, the joint control of both
the Manchurian railroads and the
port facilities of ports Arthur and
Darien. There soon followed the
organization of four joint stock
companies for the tapping of the
oil and mining in the border areas
of Manchuria and Sinkiang. To
promote the honeymoon a Sino-
Friendship Association of forty
million members was formed. In
1953, when the Chinese started
their Five Year Plan, Russia ex-
tended aid for several hundred
specific industrial projects. Fur-

ther loans were negotiated, as well
as, the port facilities of the above
ports which were turned over to
the Chinese in 1955.

Russia, meanwhile, was helping
China in the Korean War, sup-
porting her claims for Formosa
and the off-shore islands, as well
as, her seat in the United Nations.
This has been done with the Rus-
sian acknowledgement that China
was a co-equal and not a sattelite.
China praised Russia’s sending up
the “sputnik” and named its first
rural commune after it. Mao had
this to say at the time, “I think
the characteristics of the current
situation is that the east wind pre-
vails over the west wind; that is,
the strength of socialism exceeds
imperialism.”

By now, the bases of unity
were a common ideology, aims,
enemies had mutual help. Yet, af-

Washington G Lee Must Keep Improving

It has often been said that our Univer-
sity is recognized as being one of the South’s
best. We have been ranked, in recent years,
as “one of the top” small, all men’s colleges
in the nation. We have been praised and
praised for our progress we have attained in
many directions.

Our heritage gives us the obligation to
strive ahead and always to keep in our minds
the idea that improvement is the only answer
to having a truly successful university. We
must never forsake those who have worked
so long and hard for the improvement that
has been obtained.

The University’s announcement of to-
day, to come to the somewhat belated point,

ments which constanly are bickering
among themselves.

Some of our departments fail to see,
we must interject, the overall idea of the
University—that what aids one department
will in the end, aid them all.

Our gymnasium is wholly outdated. Suf-
fering from the lack of adequate facilities
which could be used as an assembly hall,
we are obliged to continue using what we
have in the hopes that eventually a brighter
day will make its overdue appearance.

By no means, we wish to reiterate, do
we question those in authority—we merely
wish to point to the fact that there definitely

ter both had tested themselves, by
a sort of flexing their muscles ef-
fort, China with her “100 Flowers
Campaign,” and the Russians with
their Anti-Party Struggle, the dif-
ferences appeared quite evident.
These differences came, according
to Professor H. H. Fisher of Mills
College, for main four main rea-
sons. Differences because of varied
national interests, over strategy
for the spread of Communism,
contrary interpretations of Marx-
Lenin Doctrine and finally as to
how to maintain monolithic soli-
darity. To elaborate on the dif-
ference over Marx-Lenin inter-
pretations, as to the inevitability
of war with the non-Communist

nations, for example, Khrushchev
holds it is not inevitable while
Mao feels it is. The Chinese feel
local “brush fire” wars are neces-
sary. The Russians discourage
these as being too dangerous.
Capitalism can only be overthrown
with violence says the Maoist,
while the Russian way is that of

CHINA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE ANTI-RUSSIAN

China feels this is too hard on real

period in terms of their cherished

Acutally, it seems a sort of law
of uneven development is opera-
tive in both of the countries and
that is making for the main stress-

Should Be On Stage

Tuesday Columnist

As this semester shifts into another year and the weather seems to be

 

es and strains of the present.What
may happen, the Russians may in-
crease pressure on the Chinese
to recant and conform. The
Chinese may, on the other hand,
succeed in convincing the Rus-
sians to hasten the world Com-
munist triumph by frequent
threats of force. The third way,
would be by both powers ack-
nowledging that their are different
roads to their Nirvana.

The conservatives seem to feel
that this conflict is still a myth
and that the Communist world is
still agreed on their basic aims
and that the conflict is based on a
combination of wishful thinking
and Communist inspired misinfor-

that a new major of Sociology and Anthro-
pology will be made available to Washing-
ton and Lee students next year, is whole-
heartedly recognized by the Tuesday Edition
as being a new and bold step forward.

Coupled with Friday’s announcement
that the new Contemporary Civilization ma-
jor will go into effect next fall, it appears to
us that the general direction which has and
is being followed by the Administration
seems to indicate that academic excellence
is being achieved.

Desiring not to overdramatize the fact
that our University is ‘‘so ideal,’ we will suf-
fice to say that the new majors will allow our
students to explore new ideas and concepts—
a factor welcomed by any university or col-
lege.

We must admit, however, that
there is always a need for even more
more improvement. We also feel we
must emphasize that we are confident
that the “New Era”’ will see that these
improvements can and will come
when if the occasion ever presents
itself.

Recognizing that financial aid is the key
to better and new improvements, we wish
to explain that although improvements do
not perhaps come as fast as we would desire
to have them, we can certainly understand
the problems which are involved.

We also can understand that financial
problems are difficult to overcome, much less
solve.

Our new science facilities appear to be
taking definite shape at this printing, and
a newly arrived era of advancement, we feel,
has at at last gotten off to a concrete start.

We cannot allow, however, the crying
needs for improvements to go unnoticed.

Our facilities in journalism, for example,
reek with a general state of antiquation.

Some of our classrooms look no better,
in many respects, than when General Lee
directed our University.

Our library leaves much to be de-
sired in the way of completeness; the
departmental libraries in most instan-
ces are highly unorganized, outdated,
and in far too many cases, have be-
come the “status symbols” of depart-

ment in our University.

We also realize that many of the areas
for improvement mentioned above already
have concrete plans concerning their com-
pletion. It is encouraging to us to see that
there are definite plans in the making.

We can, as we said earlier, understand
the main problem involved—that of finances.
But new starts must have a beginning some-
where.

Since the general topic of “inadequate
finances” has been hit upon as being the
general culprit, let us advise, if we may
be allowed to incapably attempt, that a new
day be begun in the area of financial pro-

curement.

Let us once again launch a devel-
opment plan that would have as its
ultimate goal the realization of our
provements to insure that our inad-

equacies in

an even shorter time in

the future are corrected.

We would suggest that the prog-
rams now in existence which are de-
signed to increase our income from
all possible sources be stepped up and

augmented.

Let our alumni be made to realize that
Washington and Lee is more than a Univer-
sity located in a quaint little Virginia town.

We must make the world know of our
past, our present, and of most importance,
of our promising future.

What we need, to be blunt, is a “great

deal of money.’

>

Money won’t come from heaven, we can
assure our readers; but it will eventually
come, we feel sure, if a stern and dilligent
attempt is made to secure it.

Let not only our alumni who reside in

the major centers of University Friends,

be tapped, but

locations.

also those who live in other

Let us show our generous benefactors,
without whose aid we could have never come
this far, that Washington and Lee does have
a bright and an even more promising future.

Let those who are associated in any way
with our University be shown that we are
overly eager to adyance; that we are eager to
become the best the South has to offer.

There is a nationally syndicated*
columnist, Sidney J. Harris, who is
continually writing down what pass
for witticisms under the title of
“Purely Personal Prejudices,” and
one of my PPP is against Sidney J.
Harris.

So, my Purely Personal Prejud-
ices:

The basketball team should be
teken over to the Troub Theatre
and put their com-
edies on stage. I
don’t mean to be
disrespectful of
honest, effort, and
I’m sure the team
is trying, but still
it’s hilarious.

And after last
Saturday’s game,
I’m not sure that
the basketball
scandal might not
spread to Lexing-

   

Craven

ton.

When the point spread stays at
one level for the last thee minutes,
and a sure shot by Fauber is
blocked by his own teammates
when then get the ball and throw
it out of bounds, I can hardly
avoid thinking of Aaron Wagman
and his hoods.

I realize, of course, that athletic
teams at this University are beyond
reproach because they’re amateurs.
Likewise the coaches.

Steve Henry has already found
out what it is to speak a disparag-
ing word, and I guess the powers-
that-be will settle some horrible
punishment (like making me pay
admission) on me if I lapse into
bad taste concerning the basketball
team.

But still I can’t help thinking that
basketball at this school laeves a
little to be desired, especially af-
ter a few the exhibitions this sea-
son.

Not wanting to limit my comments
to disparaging criticism, I'll try to
make some constructive remarks
when I can think of them.

One complaint I can offer the
team is that they're strong on
aesthetics. What they are able to
do on the floor may not win ball
games, but it looks good.

Take for instance, the fake as it
is used here. Never is it followed up
by a score, but it looks good every
time.

Along this same line is the gentle-
manly conduct of the team (in keep-
ing with the traditions of the school)

 

 

as it refuses to take unfair advant-

age of its opponents.

When the other team is forced
to relinquish possession as a re-
sult of some violation, it seems to
be our policy to give them back
the ball without taking a shot in
order not to make them feel bad.
Good sports we are, and winning
is indeed of secondary importance.

I’m not a sportswriter, so my views
on this subject don’t have to be
taken seriously. And as I’ve said, I
realize the team is trying.

But I’m still wondering what
they’re trying. I also realize that
the team is usually at a disadvant-
age because of height problems. But

is becoming more and more cer-
tain that the strain in relations is
real. The press of the Chinese
carries more and more anti-Rus-
sian articles while the Russians
have replied that since their help
has not been appreciated by China
it will be gradually withdrawn, as
indeed some of it has. Meetings
of the party organizations are be-
ing held and planned for the next
months. Before these meetings,
efforts will be made to compro-
mise the issues at stake. Failing
here, there will start a competi-
tive struggle to win the nations of
three continents into one power
“block” or the other. Once again,

Outman Clarifies Action
Hopes To Eliminate Confusion A bout Case

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday Edition

Dear Roy,
There are two matters involving
the Student Control Committee

which need clarification at this time;
and, as chairman
of this group, I
feel that Iam ina
position to explain
the committee’s
posture on a re=
cent violation.
First, it has
been popularly as-
sumed by some
: individuals that
: the recent § an-
Outman nouncement bear-
ing the signature of Dean E. C.
Atwood concerning an incident of
misconduct at a local restaurant
should be directly attributed to him
or to the Faculty Administrative
Committee. Such an assumption has
no validity; the Student Control
Committee acted on this incident
and the announcement stated such,

  
   

although it bore Dean Atwood’s
signature.
The Student Control Committee

has, during the past month, issued
three reports to the Faculty Ad-
ministrative Committee and it has
been their purpose to review SCC
action and in no instance has the

 

Faculty Committee recommended
any additions or corrections to the |

By Control Committee;

submitted reports.

Second, the punitive action taken
in the case at hand needs certain
clarifications.

The above-mentioned incident in-
volved a non-fraternity freshman,
and in considering the student’s
status, while reviewing the case, the
committee felt that punishment, of
the nature invoked, was necessary.
Now it has come to my attention
that certain individuals have re-
acted to this punitive action of the
committee—namely, the “campus-
ing” of the student for one month—
as being “childish,” “immature,” and
“prep-schoolish.”

In the light of this attack, it may
be beneficial to present a few rele-
vant points. First, the incident was
of such a nature that it could not
be shrugged off easily. There was
a most ungentlemanly display of
conduct, and property damage re-
sulted from the student’s actions.

With this realization in mind, the
committee endeavored to associate
punitive action with the case. As
the student was not a member of
any social fraternity, social restric-
tion could in no way be sufficient
punishment.

There was no precedent of action
taken on misconduct by a non-fra-
ternity student which the committee
could impose and still bear relevance
to the case at hand.

The committee feels the punish-
ment was relevant and proper since

POPE FOOTIE

We notice that the sport of pocket billiards continues to
tide the wave of popularity initiated by the showing of The
Hustler, this January.

The flick, presented at the State Theatre, starred Paul
Newman, Jackie Gleason, and Piper Laurie, and dealt with
the life of a hustler in his world of pool halls, suckers, gambling,
and challenges.

Pool Halls

There exists three local arenas from which the pool en-
thusiast can choose for the scene of his endeavors. The most
popular one for the W&L student seems to be the Varsity
Billiard, owned by Pete Neofotis of College Inn fame and
operated by his son George. During an interview last weekend,
Pete said that business has increased 75 per cent since the
advent of The Hustler in Lexington.

Across and down Main Street a bit from the Varsity
lurks a competitor for the honor of appeasing the W&L
student pool player. This is the pool room attached to
Jordan’s Grill. A plack on this edifice testifies that it
was, in 1883, the Lexington Lodge for the Odd Fellows.
Today it is a combo Colored Tourist Information Cent-
er, grill, and pool hall. In the evenings we find many
of the more liberal student pool players partaking in the
sport at Clark’s.

The final emporium for pool resides on sedate Nelson
Street, next door to Buddy’s. It is known to the students as

 

__ Art Portnoy and Tony Schlesinger play at the Varsity
folk simply label it the Nelson Street Pool Hall. Here are
situated six active tables and a good deal of Hustler dirt,
dingyness and ‘atmosphere.’

Clark’s Pool Room

The Clark pool room set-up is probably the most like the
halls shown in the flick. Clark’s is complete with benches for
interested spectators and a Hustleresque picket type money
window.

I-M Pool

We feel that the renaissance of pool in Lexington warrants
some action which would incorporate the sport more into our
athletic program. Inter-collegiate pool is probably a bit in the
future, but it seems to us that intramural pool is certainly very
feasible. If ping-pong and bowling are part of the program,
why not pool?

The future might even bring pool into the P.E. courses.
The Physical Education department could follow the same
procedure as they do with bowling and golf. That is have
the local owners charge the students and, of course, the regular
50-50 split between the town merchant and the P.E. depart-
ment would continue with the pool hall owner.

Regardless of what comes of this pool activity, it has hit
Lexington now, and looks as if it might take another fiick to
dispel it. Let’s hope the next one isn’t skin diving!

Tigers Stomp Generals, 70-61

By HARRY MEEM
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team started like a house afire Sat-
urday night, but wilted under steady
pressure to lose to Hampden-Sydney
Tigers, 70-61, here.

The Generals, thanks in large
part to the shooting of Bill Ide
and Tom Supak, held an 11-1
lead after five minutes of play,
pushed the lead up to 11 points,
16-5, before the Tigers started to
hit from the floor.

Tiger captain Norwood Davis,
sidelined when the Generals visited
Death Valley in January, account-
ed for ten points in a row for
Hampden-Sydney, bringing the
score from 18-11 to 23-21.

Tie Game

The Tigers tied the game at 29-
29 with 3:25 left in the half on a
jump shot by Phil Lotz. Tom Supak
sank a free throw to put the Gen-
erals aheal 30-29, then the Tigers’
Bill Hardin sank two free throws
with 40 seconds remaining to give
Hampden-Sydney a 31-30 lead at
the half.

The lead seesawed back and forth
for the first six minutes of the sec-
ond half as W&L captain Rodger
Fauber swapped shots with Hardin
and Davis. With 14 minutes left, the
Tigers’ Davis sank a free throw to
give Hampden-Sydney a 41-38 lead
which they never relinquished.

The Generals weren’t in the
game after the halfway point of
the period, as the Tigers at one
time held a 13-point lead on their
way to the 70-61 victory.

Scoring honors for the game went
to Bill Hardin of the Tigers, who
scored 22 points in the second half
after being held to four free throws
in the first 20 minutes. Hardin added
16 rebounds to his 26 points.

Right behind Hardin was Tiger
captain Norwood Davis, who hit on
five field goals and 15 of 17 free
throws for a total of 25 points. Lotz
also hit in double figures for the
visitors, with 12 points.

Fauber Top

The Generals finished with double
figures in the scoring column, Faub-
er with 18 points, Tom Supak with
16, and Ide with 12.

W&L Wrestlers
Top Duke, 19-8;
Meet H-S Next

By DAVE MONTGOMERY
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s matmen,
on the rebound from a 24-8 loss to
Norfolk William and Mary, handed
Duke a 19-8 defeat at Durham,
Saturday, to bring their overall sea-
son record to 5-2.

 

H-S Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the Generals visit
Hampden-Sydney College and then
entertain a perennially tough West
Virginia squad here Friday night at
7:30.

Against Duke, W&L rolled up a
19-8 score on a 5-4 decision by
Butch West; and 5-0 decision by
Tom Stover; a 6-1 win by newcomer
Pete Winfield ,a transfer from Okla-
homa; and a 5-3 win by Jud Bab-
cock. Herb Smith was held to a
tie giving the Generals two points,
and Sandy Mercereau gained the
only W&L pin. Charlie Dickinson,
substituting for Dave Montgomery,
who will return to the lineup to-
morrow against Hampden-Sydney,
turned in a highly creditable per-
formance in bowing 2-1, while Dick
Albert was edged on riding time,
4-3.

Generals Lose

It appeared that the Generals had
their minds on exams January 20th
as they managed to salvage only
two victories in going down to a
24-8 defeat at the hands of Norfolk
William and Mary. In what was

* 250 To Compete

Some 250 varsity and freshman
trackmen are expected to partici-
pate in the 13-event program which
begins at 2:30 Saturday afternoon.

Although VMI won last year’s
competition going away, William and
Mary and Virginia, second and third
place finishers a year ago, are ex-
pected to battle VMI for top hon-
ors.

Lord Speaks

W&L track coach Norm Lord
feels that this will be a good meet
even though the Generals won’t be
able to compete with the Big Five
schools.

He added that Jim Hickey, Rob-
in Kell and Skip Essex will bring
W&L points no matter who they
run or jump against and that the
rest of the team will give the re-
maining six schools a good scrap.

Participating for the Generals in
the dashes will be Hickey. Kell is
entered in the high jump and his
brother Chris, along with Fox Ur-
quhart will run in the middle dist-
ance races.

Mike Scoel is in the mile run and
Essex is scheduled in the middle
distance races. Jordan Smith and
Henry Sackett are broad-jumping
while Tom Edwards is in the hop,
step and jump event.

Frosh Entrants

Dave Killebrew, Ralph Gilliam,
Dave Myers and one other frosh will
run in the relay while Andy Kil-
patrick will enter the mile event.
The evening events start at 6:30 and
end with the mile relay at 9:30.

All students interested in trying
out for the baseball team are asked

Fauber added 19 rebounds to his
total for the year, but the next man
to him for the Generals in this im-
portant department was Supak, with
8.

Out-Rebound

All told, the Tigers out-rebounded
the Generals, 62-44, outshot them
from the fioor, 36 per cent to 30 per
cent, and dominated the foul lines
with 30 of 37 attempts, compared
to W&L’s 9 out of 15.

Commenting on the game, General
coach Bob McHenry said, “We look-
ed bad on the boards and offensive-
ly.” As an example of how poor
W&L’s rebounding was, McHenry
cited the fact that Hampden-Syd-
ney’s Dave Tucker, a 5’ 6” guard,
got six rebounds, the same number
that the Generals’ three centers, Bill

 

Smith, Howard Martin, and Mike
Monier, got.

In all fairness to Monier, however,
it should be pointed out that he
hasn’t played basketball since the
1959-60 season, and was playing
Saturday night with a leg injury.

Bad on Offense

McHenry added that the Gener-
als were “standing still on offense,
moving very poorly on defense, and
fouling too much.”

Who played a good game? “I
couldn’t tell you anybody for us.
We just didn’t play basketball.”

Wednesday night in an attempt to
improve their 4-7 record. Game time

W&L Must Improve

Washington and Lee must never fail to

Hell Week Is Going

Now that three fraternities have ofh-
cially “banned” Hell Week, we can see that
at last same fraternities are beginning to use
their heads.

The move which has been adopted by
PiKA, Phi Gamma Delta, and Sigma Chi
is generally regarded by the Tuesday Edition
as being a step forward toward a sensible
pledging system.

We have, on more than one occasion,
pleaded with the fraternities to abolish the
“ungentlemanly” aspects of Hell Week,
and we are quite pleased to see that at least
some of the fraternities realize that more
progressive programs are the answers to
obtaining better pledging results.

We here at Washington and Lee
pride ourselves on flexibility, and
I'm sure that we can bend over
backwards far enough to let in one

could give the basketball a much
needed lift.

Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor,
Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell—one
of them is bound to have a little
brother (or at least a protege).

All we have to do is find him,
and I’m sure he could be a savior
to the hardwood.

And if it wasn’t talked about too
much then no one would really

the action was of such a nature as

The committee felt that restric-

in an equal manner so as not to un-
justly differentiate between the ac-
tions of a fraternity and non-fra-
ternity student.

It would be hard indeed to justify
the restriction of a fraternity stu-
dent from his social privileges (were
he involved in a similar incident)
and then merely give the non-fra-
ternity student a severe verbal
warning. Thus, the committee took
the action it did by denying the non-
fraternity student any social pri-
viledges which, in the committee’s
estimation, would be formulated by
access to the town facilities.

It is my feeling that this letter
will clear up any questions concern-
ing the incident.

IFC Representative
(Continued from page 1)

Your services and counsel to all
members of this organization and
to individual fraternities have been
most valuable and sincerely appre-
ciated.

I certainly feel that the progress
made this year, particularly in the
areas of pledge-training and Help
Week, are in a large part due to
your counsel. As a token and re-
membrance of your services, the
# new revolving trophy given to the
fraternity with the most construc-
tive Help Week, will be named the
“Farrar Cup.”

In other IFC business last night,
the group voted for the final time on
the Help Week Proposals presented
several weeks ago. The vote was in
favor of adopting the proposals, thus
the proposals became a part of the IFC
Constitution.

The IFC voted also to work with
the University Dance Board for
Springs Dances. The group elected not
to have fraternities hold combo part-
ies during hours of entertainment on
the Campus.

This vote, it was noted, will not
place this action into the Constitution.
The vote on this issue will be effec-
tive only for the coming dance set.

HOW TO BE A BWOC

Ladies, let me be frank. The days of the college year dwindle
down to a precious few. And some of you—let’s face it—have
not yet become BWOC’s. Yes, I know, you’ve been busy what
with going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,
becoming a BWOC is so easy if you'll only follow a few simple
rules.

The first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC
is to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very
careful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is
bound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,
“HEY! LOOKIT ME!” Don’t you make such a horrid gaffe.
On your placard put: “ZUT! REGARDEZ MOT!” This, as
you can see, lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.

Once you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry
the placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make
distinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes
you ery, “Whippoorwill!” you cannot but stay fresh in the
minds of onlookers.

We come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC—
indeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the
BWOC clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,
it is not too much to say, a way of life.

This spring the “little boy look” is all the rage on campus.
Every coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing
short pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BWOC is doing
more. She has gone the whole hog in achieving little boyhood.
She has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her
upper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.

All this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her
date comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chie fem-
ininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only
by a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely
coiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail. Her

   

Cnet lagD

font You Make Wiha, hoe, life

daytime sneakers have been replaced by fashionable high
heeled pumps, and she does not remove them until she gets to
the movies,

After the movies, at the campus cafe, the BWOC undergoes
her severest test. The true BWOC will never, never, never, order
the entire menu. This is gluttony and ean only cause one’s date
to blanch. The true BWOC will pick six or seven good entrees
and then have nothing more till dessert. This is class and is
the hallmark of the true BWOC.,

Finally, the BWOC, upon being asked by the cigarette vendor
which is the brand of her choice, will always reply, “Marlboro,
of course!” For any girl knows that a Marlboro in one’s hand
stamps one instantly as a person of taste and discernment, as
the possessor of an educated palate, as a connoisseur of the finer,
loftier pleasures. This Marlboro, this badge of savoir-faire,
comes to you in flip-top boxes that flip, or in soft packs that are
soft, with a filter that filters and a flavor that is flavorful, in all
fifty states of the Union and Duluth.

BMOC: Buy Marlboro On Campus. Buy them downtown,
too. Either place, you get a lot to like.
