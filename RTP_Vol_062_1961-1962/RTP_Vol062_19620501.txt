IFC PRESENTED NEW RUSH PROPOSAL

Edward

To Aid In

Of New Troub Plays

By JACK DEJARNETTE

Playwright Edward Albee will arrive tomorrow to help with
the Troubadour Theater production of two of his plays, The
American Dream and Zoo Story.

Albee, who is 33, has been

writing for the theater. He has taught at Wagner College in
New York City, and has done work*

with the Circle in the Square, an off-
Broadway theatrical group.

To date, Albee has been primari-
ly associated with the off-Broad-
way production of The American
Dream and Zoo Story. He is the
author of two other plays which
have been produced off-Broadway,
The Death of Bessie Smith and The
Sandbox.

Premiered in Berlin

Zoo Story, the play for which
Albee first achieved recognition, was
first produced in Berlin in the Schil-
ler Theater. The Death of Bessie
Smith premiered there also. Albee
has won both Vernon Rice and Obie
awards in recognition of his works.

Albee is considered to be one of
a new group of playwrights asso-
ciated with the theatre-of-the-
absurd movement initiated in
France by Beckett and Ianesco.
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,
Albee’s first full-length play, is to
be released sometime this fall. Albee
is also working on a second full-
length play, Ballad of the Sad Cafe.
This is to be an adaptation of the
short story of the same name by
Carson McCullers.

To Speak May 7

Albee will be in Lexington for 10
days. His only public appearance
during that time will be on Monday,
May 7. He will speak on “The Po-
sition of the Playwright Today” at
8:15 in the Troubadour Theater.
Students and faculty will have an
opportunity to meet the playwright
during a 4 p.m. reception in Evans
Dining Hall.

In the capacity of Glasgow visit-
ing Professor, Albee will attend re-
hearsals of The American Dream and
Zoo Story in an advisory capacity.
The Glasgow Visiting Professor pro-
gram was established here in 1957
and has included such prominent
persons as Katherine Anne Porter,

Executive Committees.

In other action the EC approved,
subject to the final vote of the stu-
dent body, three measures which if
adopted will substantially alter stu-
dent government procedures.

First they formally approved a
new student body constitution which
the EC had recently drawn up. Next
they passed a proposed amendment
which calls for the replacement of
the Publication Board’s representa-
tive to the EC by a second Junior
Class representative. And finally
they approved a measure, presented
on petition of 50 signatures, which
would see the inclusion of Honor
System procedure in the new con-
stitution.

All three of these proposals will
be voted on by the student body
in the class elections to be held
Monday.

It was also announced last night
that a forum of all EC candidates
running in the class elections will
be held Thursday at 7 p.m. in the
Student Union.

Before adjourning the committee
heard the new Big Three officers

Rush Would Begin 6 Weeks
After Start Of School

By JULIAN MARKHAM
News Editor

In last night’s IFC meeting, the Rush Week Study Com-
mittee presented its recommendation for a delayed rushing sys-
tem at Washington and Lee. Terminating a six week study
period, the IFC Rush Committee headed by George Honts

 

recommended the proposed rush de-*
lay of one month as a change from
the present system that will
strengthen both the fraternity sys-
tem and the University as a whole.
On the first week-end after classes
begin in September, Freshmen in-
terested in pledging will visit each
of the fraternity houses on campus
during the following periods; Sat-
urday between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m;
and Sunday between 2 p.m. and 4
p.m. and 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. These
invitations will be carried in the
form of Open Houses and no formal
rush procedure will be allowed.

Formal Rush will begin the Sat-
urday in October when S&U re-
ports are issued, unless there is a
conflict with the University calen-
dar in which case Rush will be
delayed until | the next most suit-

Judge Barksdale
To Sit At Trial

A case of grand larceny is the
subject of the spring mock trial to
be held in the Law School on Thurs-
day of this week. The Honorable
Alfred D. Barksdale, District Judge
for the U.S. District Court of West-
ern Virginia will preside at the trial.

The grand larcency case involves
one Braxton Dew, who is charged
with the unlawful taking of an
electric typewriter from a freshman
student's room. The defense is a lack
of proper intent because the defen-
dant was intoxicated at the time of
the crime.

Committee chairman for the trial
is Francis Duckworth and committee
members are Robert Coyle and John
Dinkel. Co-counsel for the defense
are Garnet L. Patterson and Henry
Carter. Co-counsel for the prosecu-
tion are James Randolph and Jerald
Kestine.

The trial will begin at 2:00 and

able weekend as shall be deter-
mined by the IFC. There will be
no classes on the following Mon-
day and Tuesday. Fraternity men
will enter the dormitories on Fri-
day evening to make rush dates.

There will be four days of formal
rush beginning on Saturday and
ending on Tuesday with hours sim-
ilar to the present system.

Bids and selections will be submit-
ted on Thursday and formal pledg-
ing will begin on the following Sat-
urday.

The Committee recommends that
the following stipulations be ac-
cepted by the IFC and made a part
of the Rules of Rush and/or
pledging:

A) Hell Week and Help Week in
any form be immediately abolished.

B) Freshmen with three or more
U’s will be barred from rushing
until they have attained a_ .500
grade-point ratio on mid-semes-
ter or semester reports.

C) Deferred rush begin the day
mid-semester grades are submitted
by the faculty.

D) The Committee recommends
that the University begin classes
the first semester two days earlier
to compensate for lost time during
rush,

E) There will be no contact be-
tween freshmen and fraternity men
prior to formal rush except for the
periods during which the fraternities
are holding open houses on the first
week-end after classes begin.

F) Any social event sponsored by
the fraternities will be open to the
entire campus, prior to the period
of formal rush.

G) No upperclassman, excepting
dormitory counselors and non-fra-
ternity men will be allowed in the
freshman dormitories, lodgings or
the Commons unless he has the ap-
proval of the IFC president.

H) Any violation of these stipu-
lations or other stipulations set
forth in the Rush Pamphlets will
be adjudged as violations of the
rules and principles and spirit of
fair and clean rush and appro-
priate fines and punishments will
be meted out by the IFC Judicial
Council.

I) Freshmen not attaining or main-
.000 grade-point ratio on
mid-semester or semester reports
during the period of pledging be
suspended from pledging until such
an average has been attained on
mid-semester or semester reports,

Both IFC President Doenges and
Rush Committee Chairman Honts
stressed that the proposal re-
sponded to the two main Faculty ob-
jections to the present system: the
present early emphasis on the “so-
cial” rather than the “academic”
side of University life, and the pres-
ent trend of identifying a freshman
by his fraternity rather than by
his membership in the student body
of Washington and Lee. Doenges
termed the new proposal as an “ex-
tremely strong system that will help
the University to meet any of its am-
bitions while, at the same time, not
damaging the fraternity system in
any way.”

The proposed date for instituting
this delayed rush system, if adopted,
is the opening of the 1963-64 aca-
demic session. As such, the delayed
rush system as outlined above is in
skeleton form only. If the plan is
accepted, concrete rules and regu-
lations will be worked out by the
IFC in the next year. Honts ex-
pressed the Committee’s desire that
the IFC incorporate as many of the

 

Tuesday editions.

Rush Week Plan Is Sound

The Special Rush Committee of the IFC has developed
a sound plan concerning the problems of rush at W&L. The
system that they have proposed will eliminate the basic causes
of criticism of our present system and still retain the present
system’s better aspects.

Much time, effort and thought went into the drafting of the
proposal. It contains changes that can be made without causing
any great burdens on the part of any of the fraternities.

 

The complaint of having Freshmen meet the fraternities
before they meet the University will be eliminated by the
proposed new system. In addition the now controversial Hell
Week will be eliminated entirely. To some, any change, no
matter how good, will meet with disapproval. However, we
must realize that there are changes that are necessary in our
present system, and they must be made.

As we have seen in the past, we must act ourselves. If we
fail to take the initiative, someone will do it for us. This could
result in a system that would be unpopular to all. The Commit-
tee has devised a workable system and it deserves our support.

The proposed plan will not go into effect until the fall of
1963. This will give ample opportunity to work out many of
the details that will be necessary to make the system effective.
However, there are no obstacles in the new plan that cannot be
worked out and overcome.

This plan has many merits and deserves the support of all
fraternity men. The fraternities will still have ample time to
rush and to secure pledges, and the University will have a better
chance to assimilate the Freshmen into the ways of the school.

Constitution Should Be Passed

The passage of the Sigma Delta Chi amendment to allow
press representation at Executive Committee meetings will now
allow full coverage of all legislative sessions. It is significant to
note that it was the only amendment to receive the necessary
majority in the campus elections last Thursday.

We of the Tuesday Edition shall endeavor to keep the stu-
dent body informed of all legislative business conducted by the
Executive Committee. It is our hope that by being better in-
formed the campus will become more interested in the workings
of its government.

On the other hand, we are sorry to see that the Constitution
proposed by the Executive Committee failed to receive the
necessary one-half vote.

It is hard to understand the reasons behind its failure to
pass. The EC Constitution represented many hours of hard,
serious labor on the part of the Executive Committee. There
was nothing radically new or different in the proposed constitu-
tion. Rather, it sought to streamline the constitution now in use.

The EC Constitution was created with the best interests of
the Student Body in mind, yet, it failed to pass.

The Executive Committee gave ample publicity to their
document and sought to explain the necessary changes to the
Student Body. However, all of this met with little interest or
enthusiasm. Therefore, it seems rather ridiculous to kill a
worthwhile document that everyone seemingly approved.

We realize that there was another Constitution presented
by a group of students for approval. However, this document
was cumbersome and contained many unneeded provisions and
deserved to be defeated.

The EC-proposed Constitution will be presented again in
the class elections. At this time, the student body will again
have the opportunity to pass judgment. It is our hope that it
will succeed. There is no sound reason for it to fail. We hope
that the Student Body will wake up and give this document a
fair chance.

Unless the EC Constitution receives the necessary one-
half vote for approval, we will be forced to labor under our
old constitution until some one can dream up a document that
will meet everyone’s approval. At the present rate of progress,
it is hard to tell when this will be possible.

“Announcing workcamp,”
sign read.
To most that opening phrase on
a poster would not be particularly
alluring. But to a few who read on,
the rest of the poster was quite in-
triguing, for it told of the chance
for work and study for college stu-
dents in Ghana this summer.

Christian To Go

One of those to whom the notion
appealed was Meade Christian,
Washington and Lee junior from
Richmond.

“When Reverend Bill Snyder,
Episcopal minister to students
here, first approached me with the
idea,” Christian said, “I was
very uncertain about the whole
thing. It’s not easy to leave friends
and a comfortable summer job,
but the more I thought about it,
the more I saw that here was a
chance to spend my summer doing
something that will be worth re-
membering.”

And remember it he should, for
the group of 15 American and 15
Ghanian students will be roughing
it all the way. “I’ve already been
warned that food and living con-
ditions won’t be in the luxury class,”
he said. To start things in the right
way, he’s already begun a series of
a dozen shots he must take before
leaving.

The group, sponsored by the Na-
tional Council of the Episcopal
Church, will leave New York on
July 3 and will arrive in Accra, the

 

capital of Ghana, the next day. They

will have a brief indoctrination per-
iod and will then leave for the
workcamp in the Volta region on
the borders of the Republic of Togo
They won't return until August 28.

“T haven’t been told yet what type
of construction work we will be
doing, but 1 imagine it will be some-
thing vital, such as a hospital or
school,” Christian said.

This in itself would make the ven-

First, I will get a lot out of it per-

er than this, I hope it is a move

groups will come to know each
other better. It’s a way to possibly

help clear up misconceptions which
we have of the Ghanians and that
they have of us. I hope it’s a posi-
tive step forward in world com-
munications,” he said.

For this purpose Christian will be
spending the 25 days before he
leaves in the library “boning up on
both Ghana and America. I fully
expect that the most vital part of
the program will be the formal and
informal discussions we hav2 with
these people. They will be seeking
to understand America, and we will
be seeking to understand Ghana. J
hope to be able to use this under-
standing even more when we re-
turn,”

Christian admits he still feels
shaky about the whole idea—not be-
cause of the hardships but for the
significance the trip may have. “The
world and political situation being
what it is today, this trip could
very well be crucial to the entire
program.

“We will be called on to defend
our country, and any mistakes we
may make could be readily capital-
ized by anti-Americans. There are
possibilities for both great harm and
good here,” he said.

This mission, he feels is the right
thing for both his own future and
the future of world understanding.
“One thing has made me so cer-
tain of this is the great response
I have had from people here and
at home. Each student must
finance his own trip, and people
I hardly know have offered to aid
me out of their own pockets. I
think it’s something they would
like to do if they had the chance.
This really makes me optimistic.”

 

Dear Sir,

I am an Independent Party mem-
ber who is very discouraged by last
Thursday’s elections. But what both-
ers me is not the outcome of the
election but the way in which vic-
tory was seemingly achieved. No one
can deny that the winners of the
Big Three are competent and quali-
fied men and I am sure they will
carry W&L forward. I repeat, these
individuals are not the real ques-
tion.

What is discouraging is the way
we go about selecting our candidates
and our real reasons behind our
votes. Do we vote for the man or for
the party? I suspect we vote for the
party.

Spoils System

Now this doesn’t really upset me
because we work on the spoils sys-
tem and the party that wins has
more spoils to hand out so why not
vote straight party and receive our
fair share?

I'll tell you why. Because each
of us will someday be a respon-
sible member of society and it
will be up to us—the educated, the
leaders— to respond to society’s
needs and have a responsible and
responsive government. In order
to do this we are going to have
to support men and ideas—not
Democrats , Independents, or Re-
publicans, not big business and not
labor. Will we be prepared to take

a free and democratic society? I
think not, in the light of the past
elections.

Next year we will again have the
dance sets to give to houses that
are “in line.” We will probably even
have freshmen offices which will be
another three or four political spoils.

No Partisan Politics

But let’s get away from partisan
politics. Let’s examine the various
proposals. I can see how people could
justify their vote against changing
the E.C. Publications Board member.
I can see how people could vote
against the student-senate proposai.
But for the life of me I cannot see
why the E.C.’s constitutional propc-
sal failed. I can’t blame this on party
lines. Steve Suttle, Meade Christian,
and Buck Ogilvie worked together
many, many weekends in order to
polish it up for us. Both parties sup-
ported it. And yet it failed to ob-
tain the necessary two-thirds vote.
This is why I attack the party sys-
tem—this shows that it is not for
ideas that people vote but for the
party; and a proposal that does not
directly concern the party—even
though both parties strongly sup-
port it—is doomed to failure.

Why?
Why? Apathy. An easy word—
blame it on apathy and forget it. But

no, surely no one is that interested
in having a nominating convention

They came into Lexington like a

that lemmings know where they are

They swept over the town like

of the library, and the pool hall.

that screamed, “If you’re a part of

They were all tagged like various

than two candidates running for
an office (or are they?), surely no
one is against the presidents of the
respective classes doing something—
like being president of a dance set,
surely no one is against the many
little changes which took so much
time and which are designed to serve
all of us better. And yet, with every-
one (except you know who) support-
ing the E.C.-proposed constitution, it
failed.

Do two men who put out a sheet
in “Protest” have that much in-
fluence? Or is it that we realiy
just didn’t bother to spend 15
minutes of our precious time io
read something designed for our
own good. This is the disappoint-
ment that I feel—not that the elec-
tions didn’t go the way I wanted
but that it exhibited so many traits
that are repugnant to me.

 

W&L Students Are Unthinking Voters

Thursday Voting

If each of us, when he voted
Thursday, was sincere that our votes
were cast for the best men and not
for the party, if each of us who ab-
stained or voted negative on the pro-
posed constitution had an honest
reason for doing so then I apologize
and will support wholeheartedly the
majorities’ position. But if we voted
a certain way because we were told
to do so or for selfish reasons, if we
abstained from voting because we
really just didn’t care enough to
read over something that represented
many personal sacrifices for others
then I think it is time for us to re-
evaluate ourselves and our func-
tions; for we are neglecting our re-
sponsibilities to ourselves and to

Washington and Lee.

Sincerely,

After a jam packed, fun filled
week such as last one, this week
will probably be short-lived in the
memory of all of us. The anti-
climatic never seems to endure.
And so I have chosen not to write
about events like the election cer-
tainly was, and SIPA is being talk-
ed about like it certainly was, and
like all that.

Instead I prefer to dwell on some-
thing which has the potential to af-
fect us all in the
future. I’m speak-
ing of course of
the possible shift
in de-emphasis in
university athlet-
@ ics which might
= occur much soon-
* er than any of us
might think. This
possibility has
been given some
impetus through
small but import-
ant articles on the sports pages of
the last two issues of the Ring-tum
Phi (with the exclusion, of course,
of the special SIPA edition). By
this time you should all have guessed
that I’m referring to the beginning
of a trend away from University
sponsored athletic endeavors and
toward individual pursuits such as
drag racing and turkey shooting.
This should be looked upon as a
manifestation of a much larger
trend. However, today I shall look
at it in itself and try to evaluate
drag racing and turkey shooting
at W&L per se.

Drag racing, first of all, is not
generally look upon as an IN sport.
While not wanting to cast a stigma

on those students who are currently

Craven Lauds Turkey Shooting;
Offers Advice To Dragsters

engaged in this activity, I do think
we should look at the situation
realistically. Drag racing is bour-
geois. Let me hasten to add, how-
ever, that it need not remain so.

With this in mind, I want to pose
some questions to all present and
future would-be dragsters—ques-
tions which will have to be answered
in the affirmative before the Univer-
sity and the Student Body can of-
ficially sanction participation in this
nouveau competitive endeavor.

1) Do participants dress as gentle-
men? I can think of nothing worse
than a sport in which the uniform
of the day is allowed to be greasy,
oily and sweaty. W&L men should
be in the vanguard of dragsters who
insist upon coats and ties worn by
all drivers.

2) Is this sport honorable above
all? It is unnecessary for me to
point out why this question must
be answered with a_ resounding
“YES!” for a W&L man would never
enter a race with dishonorable com-
petitors. Especially drag racing, for
although honesty wins out in the
long run, dishonesty can almost al-
ways take you in the quarter-mile.

3) Is there some sort of assimila-
tion program set up for beginners
or must tyros educate themselves?
The recent election platforms should
point out the necessity of this.

4) Can a speaking tradition be in-
itiated? Unlike the sport of sports
car racing, in which drivers of
sports cars always wave to drivers
of other similar sports cars, I cannot
think of instances where dragsters
acknowledge another dragster’s pres-
ence except by a blast of fire and
smoke from the exhaust pipes. This
will have to be eliminated before
University sanction can be gained.

New Record

Pearson, Kell, Hickey and Essex
composed the record breaking team
for the sprint medley. They man-
aged to cover the distance in 3:37,
more than two seconds faster than
the old time set by High Point in
1960.

Robin Kell bested his recent
school record of 42.5 feet with a
hop, step and jump of 43 feet 1 1/2
inches. Henry Sackett tied Kell’s
old record in the same event.

In the Javelin event, Ken Boiar-
sky threw the dart 175 feet, 11 3/4
inches. This is the best toss of the
year for the W&L javelin throwers.

Sackett and Kell, with a broad
jump of 21 feet 7 inches and a high
jump of 6 feet 3 inches respectively,
posted other bests for the team this
season.

Today, the Generals meet Elon and
East Carolina, here.

Trout Fishing
Best In May

One sport seems to get overlooked
by students at Washington and Lee.

That sport is fishing.

For those who don’t realize it,
W&L is centrally located to most
of the best fishing streams in west-
ern Virginia. The Maury River, only
a few minutes’ walk from the cam-
pus, is one of the better smallmouth
streams in the state.

The two main fish sought after in
the area are trout and bass. The
trout which the fisherman will usu-
ally find in the 1,500 miles of trout
water open to the public is the rain-
bow. This is the fish with which the
Virginia Fish and Game Commission
heavily stocks the streams every
year.

About 300,000 adult fish averaging
12 inches are released yearly. The
best fishing begins after the opening
crowds have subsided. The season
began this year about three weeks
ago, and the best spring trout fish-
ing should be the month of May.

 

Notice

Spring soccer practice will be held
next week. All players returning
from last year’s team and any others
interested in trying out for the team
should draw equipment and go out
to practice.

Win First Game

Washington and Lee’s stickmen
recorded their first win of the season
by defeating the University of North
Carolina, 9-4, here, Saturday.

Gummey

Junior midfielder, Charlie Gum-
mey led the Generals scoring with
three goals, two of which were re-
corded in the first period.

Carrol Klingelhoffer, a freshman
in the attack position, was also a
standout with one goal and three
assists. Bob Hankey, another frosh
attackman, and sephomore mid-
fielder John McDaniel, who is the
team’s leading scorer to-date, each
tallied two goals.

Wirt Vanderworker turned out
the only outstanding performance
for the Tar Heels scoring two of
their goals.

Coach McHenry stated _ that,
though the Generals kept possession
of the ball most of the game, he felt
that their performance had dropped
from the two previous games.

CLUB &
CAMPUS
FASHIONS

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, esquirt's Fashion Director

A few early heat waves have triggered the rush to find something
cool to get into, and your wisest buy is the seersucker suit. As with
buying all summer clothes, select it with the thought of also wear-
ing it to work. Seersucker weaves, made by alternating stripes of
creped and plain weave, are growing favorites on Campus. Today’s
seersuckers are new in two ways; blending polyester with cotton
has ended that former slept-in look ... and a handsome new range
of colors and patterns is making news beside the traditional pale
stripings. Here are some highlights, plus a few other warm-weather
wearables—all top choice among university men.

 
  

  

SUIT... now in bold, bright-color stripes, very
wide to pinstripes—also unusual plaids, checks }
.and new patterns. With the crisp, assertive col- }
ors and the new shape retention, they’re perfect
for dress-up as well as casual occasions. Added
bonus: the suit jacket doubles as a sport jacket
... ideal with a pair of dark, solid color slacks.

ye
L
THE SHIRTS THAT SHOULD always and. only be worn with

your seersucker suits: solid color oxford or batiste button-downs.
And let the shirt pick up a color in the jacket... YELLOW, for
example—great! Then choose a solid or neat print silk foulard
TIE, or a cotton paisley.

ONE STRAW MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE—to complete the

junior executive look, the finished elegance of the well-chosen HAT
IS A MUST. Most popular: soft, flexible RAFFIA STRAW in
OLIVE... NATURAL COLOR, rough-textured COCOANUT
PALM—jaunty telescope crown, not too narrow brim, banded with
batik or madras prints... or with the 3-pleat, colorful band called
a PUGGREE, borrowed from India—originally the light scarf
around the pith helmets that used to ‘go out in the noonday sun.’

YES, MISTER—CLEAN WHITE BUCKS are

far and away the most suitable shoes we’ve ever
seen with seersucker suits.

SLACKS—THE LOW RISE IN HIGH FAVOR

-». (preferably not in suits, but only slacks)
cut to ride the hipbones rather than the waist

BLAZING FLANNEL BLAZER in fire-engine

red is made of the well-proven blend of 50-50
wool and cotton... has pearl or metal buttons,
natural shoulders, patch flap pockets and welt
seams. Note it also in bright blue, bright yellow,
bright green. Memo to Club committee: INSIG-
NIA looks its most impressive in such an impec-
cable setting.

THE SOFT TOUCH IN FOOTWEAR—campus

 

men can well be
accused of ‘going soft’ and quite happy about it—in the newest
slip-on shoes of softest construction, usually unlined for lightness
and coolness. Consider a pliant pair in a dark color, of smooth or

slightly grained ‘llama’ calf.

Montgomery Is New SSS Head

The Student Service Society is
an organization on campus whose
importance is greatly underestimated
by the majority of students. Want-
ing in glory and renown, the So-
ciety nevertheless plays a key role
in the life and success of the Uni-
versity.

Consistent teamwork has made the
organization effective, and this year
under the leadership of Steve Galef
it has continued to play its part
efficiently. Deans Farrar and Gilliam
can cite numerous cases in which
the SSS has been the deciding fac-
tor in a top-notch student’s decision
to come here. The Admissions Of-
fice receives numerous letters of
praise from impressed parents and
prospective students.

New Officers

Next year the SSS will be under
the recently elected president Dave
Montgomery, a rising senior from
Richmond. The new vice president
is Tony Schlesinger, rising senior;
the secretary-treasurer is Ken Lane
rising junior; and the editor of the
Student Handbook is rising junior
Jim Wallenstein.

The society serves as host to a
number of groups visiting W&L.
Among these are the Australian
lacrosse team, the alumni return-
ing to reunions, and parents on
Parents’ Weekend. The annual
SIPA conference is likewise facili-
tated by SSS work.

The society's work ranges from
conducting tours of the campus to
ushering and seating guests at Uni-
versity banquets.

Consisting of sophomores, juniors,

voluntary and there is no salary in-

Baltimore, founded the Society in

remarked, “the SSS has been one of
the most instrumental organizations
on campus.”

Applications for membership in
the society are made annually in the

fall.

 

Dean’s Office Names

Twenty-five men, predominantly
rising juniors and seniors, have
been chosen by the Dean’s Office to
serve as dormitory counselors for
the coming year. This is an increase
of six over last year’s total.

from Richmond, will be Head Coun-
selor next year. Sharp, who was As-
sistant Head Counselor this year,
replaces Tim Ireland.

Assistant Head Counselors for the
coming year will be Bob Payne and
Bob Morton.

The other counselors:

John Baker, Dan Balfour, A. J.

New Rush Plan

existing rush rules as would be
feasible under the new system.
Rush Committee member Roy
Goodwin emphasized the RWSC’s
feeling that this proposal must re-
ceive the careful consideration of
fraternity men. “It is not change
for change’s sake,” said Goodwin.
“The new delayed rush system as
proposed is the most workable plan
that can adequately coordinate the
interests of both faculty and fra-
ternity. The acceptance of this pro-
posed rush system by the IFC could
only lead to the faculty’s recogni-
tion of the IFC as a responsible stu-
dent organization.”

The Committee feels that its pro-
posed system has advantages over
the other delayed systems studied,
and even over the present system.
The proposal also stated that “We
feel the freshmen under the pro-
posed system will receive a more
adequate assimilation into the Uni-
versity life, with the proper empha-
sis placed on academic pursuits, and
will obtain a better perspective of
the Washington and Lee fraternity
system.”

At Athletics

These are the big questions in-
volved for W&L and drag racing. Of
course there are others, but they are
of minor importance, and can be
taken care of when these big ones
are satisfied. I for one, am looking
forward to the time when dragging
becomes a full-fledged University
sport. Think of the thrill of seeing
one of the University station wagons
peeling rubber on the footbridge in
a race against the clock.

As for turkey shooting, I think
that the above questions must be
applied to this sport also. Of course,
some modification will be necessary.
But I think you will all agree that
the more turkeys that are shot
around here, the better off we'll
all be.
