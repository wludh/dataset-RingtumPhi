TUESDAY
Edition

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

Dr. Joseph C. Robert, former President
of Hampden-Sydney College, will be the
principle speaker for the 47th Annual ODK
Tap Day.

The yearly event at Washington and Lee
will be held this year on December 12 to
recognize outstanding leadership abilities
in students, faculty, and alumni.

The Tap Ceremony will be held at 12:00
followed by a luncheon in Evans Dining
Hall.

Dr. Robert, a native of State College,
Mississippi, is now professor of history at
the University of Richmond. He received
his A.B. and LL.D. degrees from Furman
College in 1927 and 1959 respectively. He
also received an A.M. and a Ph.D. from
Duke between 1929 and 1933. He received
an honorary Doctor of Literature degree

from Washington and Lee when he was on
the campus in 1958.

Following his work at Duke Dr. Robert
spent the ensuing years in various teach-
ing positions at several universities, until
he was asked to be President of Coker Col-
lege in 1952. He served in this position un-
til 1955 when he took the presidency of
Hampden-Sydney.

He remained there until 1960 when he
received a Ford Foundation grant to study
the different aspects of European universi-
ties. It was then that he left Hampden-
Sydney and upon returning to the United
States took the professorship of history at
Richmond.

Dr. Robert has done much work and re-
search into the development of the tobac-
co industry and has written several books
on the subject, including The Tobacco
Kingdom and The Story of Tobacco in
America.

Omicron Delta Kappa was founded forty-
seven years ago at Washington and Lee
for the purpose of “bringing together cam-
pus leaders in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
From that time the honorary fraternity has
grown in stature until there are now over
ninety chapters or circles at universities
and colleges throughout the country.

The idea for the organization of a so-
ciety to recognize superior citizenship and
leadership came from W&lL Professor Ru-
pert N. Latture and his college roommate
James C. Fisher. The idea was presented to
several members of the faculty and with
their support and the approval of Univer-
sity president Dr. Henry Louis Smith a
small group was formed “to bridge the gap
between faculty and students and help
make clear the aspirations of each.”

The purpose of this newly-formed group
was threefold: (1) to recognize men who
have attained efficiency in collegiate activi-

ties; (2) to bring together the most repre-
sentative men in all phases of college life;
and (3) to collect members of the faculty
and student body of an institution on the
bases of mutual interests and understand-
ing.

The rapid spread of the organization
after its formation was due partly to the
recognition that it could fill a gap in the
student-faculty relations in many univer-
sities and colleges. In many schools mem-
bership in ODK is the “highest honor on
campus” and is reserved for only a small
portion of the student body.

The new initiates of ODK are chosen by
the members who have been tapped in
previous years. These me nhold several
meetings prior to the actual ceremony to
determine those to be initiated on ODK
Day. At present there are ten student
members at Washington and Lee, two un-
dergraduates and eight law students.

BRUBECK TO PLAY FOR °62 FD CONCERT

 

IFC Passes New Pledge Training Resolution

IFC Passes Special Resolution;
Curbs Use On Pledge Training

Washington and Lee’s IFC last night passed a sweeping
amendment to its constitution that will curb the pledge train-
ing activities of fraternities for the first semester of this year

and for years to come.

Prompted to action by a formal complaint which was re-
cently issued against two of the 18 fraternities by a member
of the W&L faculty, the IFC passed the resolution by a 13-2

vote.

The resolution, in effect, states that
(1) no fraternity can hold “training”
sessions after 11 p.m. during the first
semester; (2) these sessions must be
held inside the fraternity houses;
(3) the IFC hopes that the Univer-
sity would forward all complaints
made to the Dean’s Office and to
the University Proctor to the IFC
President for further action, and (4)
a fine of not less than $50.00 nor
more than $100.00 be placed on
houses who violate this rule.

The IFC withheld the names of the
two houses against whom the com-
plaint was lodged; but it was an-
nounced since this case prompted
the legislation and had occured pre-
vious to it, the offending houses
would only be verbally reprimanded
and no fines imposed.

The amendment was passed in the
IFC’s regular meeting, and the ques-
tion of punishment for the two
houses involved was forwarded to
the IFC’s Judicial Committee which
is composed of all the fraternity
presidents.

The complaint against the fraterni-
ties was explained by IFC Presi-
dent Doenges who pointed out that
there had been a number of per-
sons complaining that training ses-
sions were causing excessive noise
in the streets, that the sessions had
been keeping the pledges out too
late; and that the IFC had no posi-
tive regulations dealing with pledg-
ing activities during the first se-
mester.

It was pointed out by a number
of fraternity spokesmen that they
wanted some type of police action
to be set up to restrict the area of
“training session” activity.

The amendment is as follows:
“It is resolved that all pledge
training sessions during the first
semester must end by 11 p.m., and
that these activities must take
place inside of the fraternity hous-
es. It is the request of the IFC that
all complaints to the University
Proctor or to the Dean’s Office
in the future be forwarded to the
President of the IFC for action.

The fine shall not be less than $50 |

nor exceed $100 and shall be levied
at the discretion of the Judicial
Committee.”

IFC is capable of handling its own
affairs.

The voting on this_ resolution
showed that 13 houses favored the
amendment, two opposed, one ab-
stained from voting, and two houses
were absent.

Doenges pointed out in the regu-
lar meeting that the complaint had
been sent to Dean Frank J. Gilliam
by a member of the Faculty. Dean
Gilliam, he said, forwarded the com-
plaint to the IFC for action.

In other’ business, President
Doenges gave a report on his trip

Costumes For Fancy Dress Ball

To Be Placed On Sale This Week

BY ANDY NEA

Managing Editor
Dave Brubeck, internationally acclaimed as one of the
world’s foremost jazz personalities, has been signed to play at
the Fancy Dress Concert, it was announced today by Dance

Doremus Gymnasium from 3

. Brucek’s appearance will add
to the top entertainers scheduled to appear during this year’s

Brubeck’s currently riding crest of new-found popularity
in the “top twenty” bracket with his recording of ‘'Take Five.”

enough of his importance to feature
him on their cover.

Has Many Albums

A glance at the list of Brubeck
recording makes apparent the broad-
ness and versatility of his talent. In
addition to regular albums of stand-
ard jazz tunes, there are such origi-
nal albums as “Time Out” and “Time
Further Out” which are far re-
moved from the usual jazz style.
Soon to be released is a record
featuring Brubeck and Louis Arm-
strong.

Paul Desmond

Each member of the Brubeck
Quartet has won impressive recog-
nition and is a soloist in his own
right. Paul Desmond, alto sax, Joe
Morello, drums, and Gene Wright,
bass, combined with the fabulous
piano of Brubeck makes an unbeat-
able combination.

Brubeck’s appearance at this year’s
53rd Faney Dress Weekend is ex-
pected to augment the dance set
greatly. Duke Ellington has already
been signed to play for the Fancy
Dress Ball to be held Friday, Feb-
ruary 1.

As was announced last week, the
theme of this year’s Ball is to be
High Society. The Friday night
dance will be held in the Commons,
a new feature this year.

Dress will be conventional for the
concert to be held in the gym. The
time of the concert might possibly
be changed so as to reduce the con-
flict with fraternity house parties.
A meeting of the Dance Board pres-
ident with the fraternity social
chairmen is scheduled for this week.

Costumes for the Fancy Dress
Ball will go on sale this week.
They will be sold from Wednesday
through Friday in the Student
Union from 9:20 to 5:00 p.m. The
dress will simulate that of a Ban-
quet of State or an Inaugural Ball
and will consist of tails for the
men and formals for the ladies.
This has made it possible to reduce
cost of costumes to $10.00 as only
male dress will be rented.

Editorially Speaking

Press Of Virginia Hails Faculty
For Posttion On Free Inqutry

Now that the Martin Luther King issue seems to have
passed, and now that the dust has slowly begun to settle from
this controversy, we feel that several statements which recently
have been made in the press of Virginia are worthy of con-
sideration.

 

During the last few days, favorable comment which was
directed at W&L has appeared in the press of this state. This
comment has been concerned with the faculty’s resolution of
disagreement with the University Trustees’ decision to ban Dr.
King from speaking here.

By no means in bringing this issue back to the Ring-
tum Phi does the Tuesday Edition wish to become the
“King Clarion,” as we have been called. As we have re-
peatedly said earlier in editorials, we do not agree with
the ideas that Dr. King holds on segregation, and we are
not going to take this opportunity to change our former
stand.

Washington and Lee’s faculty has been heralded by the
press for a statement which was released before Thanksgiving
by Dr. Cole at the request of the faculty. This statement was
that “This decision, (of the Trustees) in the opinion of the
faculty, seriously limits the freedom of inquiry, that should pre-
vail in an institution of higher learning, and denies to students
the opportunity to learn and judge for themselves, even upon
issues of controversy.”

As was pointed out in no less than three different newspap-
ers published in Virginia, the crux of this controversy, as it ap-
pears to us, was that no university or college should ever deny
students free inquiry—even in the case of a controversial figure.

The Roanoke Times on November 23 in their editorial
“Good For W&L’s Faculty!” said that “The teachers deserve
applause for their boldness and loyalty to one of the deepest
obligations of their profession—defense of the right to know.
In going on record in this fashion they have redeemed the uni-
versity from an unfortunate impression created by the board.”

“Free Inquiry at Washington and Lee” was the editorial
which the Norfolk Virginia-Pilot printed on November 24;
“The faculty’s attitude is so clearly in conformity with the great
traditions of university freedom, of the virtues of free inquiry,
and of the rights of men to examine ideas in the competition
of the market-place that it is surprising that a university faculty
has to recall these fundamentals of American life.”

The November 22 issue of the Norfolk Ledger-Star, in
editorial, “A Halo And A Dunce Cap,” added to the cause
of free inquiry by saying that ‘We note the trustee’s acknowl-
edgement of Washington and Lee’s faculty’s concern for free-
dom of inquiry.”” (This reference to a statement made by Mr.

James R. Caskie of Lynchburg who is one of the Trustees of
We&L.)

The editorial continues by saying, “If we may say so, the
university would be better off if the trustees had shared that
concern. For in turning down approval for his appearance on
the campus, the trustees have thoughtlessly placed a halo of
seeming martyrdom on a man they distrust and a dunce-cap on
a university they love. It goes without saying that neither was
their purpose. But it remains to be added that they can recon-
sider—and they ought to do so.”

The members of the Washington and Lee faculty
are, indeed, to be hailed for their stand. Many profes-
sors possibly placed themselves in a “‘strained’’ light by
supporting a cause which disagrees with a decision of
the Trustees. To the faculty that went on public record
in their decision to uphold the right of free inquiry we
say “thanks.”

We are indebted to you for your position on this matter,
and we are thankful for your trying to uphold the name of a
fine university—Washington and Lee.

End of story, end of song.

—R. R. G.

Pamphlet Is A Good Idea

The Liberty Hall Society, as we understand it, is toying
with the idea of publishing a pamphlet which would discuss the
good points and the drawbacks of all the courses in Washington
and Lee’s undergraduate school.

It has long been the opinion of many students that such
a measure should have been taken by some organization long
before this.

The Tuesday Edition supports this move by the Liberty
Hall Society, and we wish them the best of luck in their efforts.

We agree with the Friday Edition’s “Behind the News...”
which said that “such a pamphlet would help students pick
their schedules, and encourage professor to take a new look
at their courses.”

Such a pamphlet indeed would be a move in the best inter-
ests of Washington and Lee, and we think that the Liberty
Hall Society has hit upon a good idea.

Cotillion Offers Contrast To

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist
Everyone should go to the Cotil-
lion at Hollins once in his lifetime.
It would probably be better to go
after you get out of school, but
you should make it once. The
Hotel Roanoke is really a change
from fraternity basements; almost

as big a switch as drinks in glass-
es instead of paper cups.

And it really is fun to put on
a tux, too, and then to make all
the variations on the traditional
theme by wearing a striped but-
ton-down shirt, unmatched cum-
merbund and tie, white sox and un-
shined brown Weejuns. And chicks

 

Honts Classifies The Twist—
Nature Girl, John Birch Types,
Members Of Nervous Navels Club

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

Personally I'll be glad when the
Twist has gone the way of the
Charleston, the Ramble and the
immortal Fox Trot.
It gives me a
tummy ache. And
for me that is a
@ big problem.

' Nonetheless the
Twist is here and
_ there’s not much
we can do but
hope the human
body will hold to-
gether until it
goes away.

Unlike stacking
people in phone booths or running
down old ladies in souped-up
sports cars, the Twist is no longer
the sole property of the college set.
Wealthy old women do it to ‘reduce,’
27-month-old brats have been
caught at it, and the rumor is that
John Kennedy didn’t wrench his
back while breaking ground after all.

I have witnessed one 80-year-old
gentleman doing it. He wore out
three partners in the course of an
evening.

  

Honts

I'm told they are doing it in all
the fashionable night spots and
clubs across the country, but I
haven't been anywhere except
Doc’s lately so we'll have to rely
on hearsay.

Barring trips to the Twilight Zone,,
I plan to make a detailed study of
Twisters at all the future combo
parties and then write a book about
it. Also there are plans afoot to
form a Twisters’ Club to study the
various techniques. It'll be called
Nervous Navels Anonymous and will
meet every Wednesday in the Stu-
dent Union. Anyone can join pro-
vided they have a navel that’s
nervous and can pass the three-
hour Twisters’ entrance exam. If
you are really interested it might
be wise to bring along an auto-
graphed picture of Buster Brown or
a lock of Chubby Checker hair.

But I have digressed. I want to
tell you about my book. Actually I
began my study of twisters this
weekend and I made considerable
progress until I collided with a big
bird about 11 o'clock.

There is, I found, one type of girl
who can be classified as a John
Birch Twister—very conservative.
This type twists like she had just
stepped on some _ second-handed
chewing gum and is frantically try-
ing to scrape it off. Actually she’s
no fun to twist with unless it’s
after midnight and you are tired,
or there are so many people at the
party you are forced to twist in a
broom closet.

More fun and twice as dangerous
to twist is the Nature Girl. For
instance, I picked out one demure
looking young lady Saturday night
and asked for a dance. Had she
been older she could have passed
for Whistler's Mother—but, ye
gods, when the music started she
went off like a neurotic popcorn

 

popper. She twisted twice around
the room, out the door and into
the street.

To save face there was nothing I
could do but twist along. Much later
when I was alone and had time to
check, I found my appendectomy
sear has been stretched a good three
inches. That, of course, was after a
couple of faithful fraternity broth-
ers had gathered up that heap on
the pavement that was me.

Probably the most popular type
of twister is the Handy-man. If your
tummy is cramped from too much
twisting, wave your hands over your
head, throw your arms out to either
side and give with an up and down
motion like you were juggling base-
balls. That way if anyone is watch-
ing you they are distracted by the
hand motions and don’t notice if
you are wiggling or not.

Another popular variety of Twist-
er is the Half-tracker. He raises
one leg until his foot is parallel
with the floor. The rib cage goes one
way, the pelvic...er...area goes
another and that extended foot yet
another. It’s charming to watch and
may prove to be a scientific boon. If
we ever get that other foot off the
floor there is hope we'll break
through to the long sought fourth
dimension.

Maybe it’s an old variation, I
hadn’t noticed until recently, though;
but one of my roommates dribbles
an imaginary basketball while he
twists. He’s a fairly normal, red-
blooded American boy, but when he
goes up for a jump shot I wonder.
This variety defies classification.

The last category I noted this
weekend was the Up and Down
Twister. Twist a while standing and
twist a while in a modified squatting
position.

This type of twisting requires
agility, coordination and a deli-
cate sense of balance since you’re
going four ways at once. That,
or you probably can do it if you
have a pot belly that is counter-
balanced ala posterior. I fall into
the second sub-classification and
have achieved remarkable success
as an Up and Down Twister.

So the foundation is laid for my
book. If anybody has any advice or
information to offer pick up a couple
dates and twist over to our place.
We'll draw the curtains, lock the
doors, and, with the volume down
low but on the soundtrack of “The
Guns of Navarone.” That should be
a pleasant diversion—no one out our
way has learned to twist to it yet.

WGL Party

in formals are just too much, every
now and Lynn.

The difference between Cotil-
lion and a W&L week-end is more
than location. Cotillion is just a
big formal cocktail party that defi-
nitely ends on time, but not in
time to go to the Hollins Inn.

At Cotillion you don’t have to
worry about keeping the combo
filled with Scotch, but you do
have to worry about yourself.

The drink ticket scheme is the
most diabolical plan that I have
ever encountered. For those un-
familiar with the system, your date
buys so many (but not too many,
because there’s a limit) drink
tickets for each night, and you’ve
got to turn them in for booze dur-
ing the half-hour that the bar’s
open. The result of this system
is that everybody rushes to the
bar the minute they get to the
hotel, turns in all his _ tickets,
tries to balance all his drinks for
the rest of the night, and ends up
getting everything spilled on his
shirt at least three times.

Only one guy really beat the
system, and he had his coat poc-
kets lined with plastic so he could
just pour his drinks in, and then
dip them out with a shot glass.

Cotillion is also a good chance
to meet and be polite to boys from
other schools like UVa. Dart-
mouth, VMI, and the like. You’re
always much more polite there
than you are here because you
never know who might set up a
bar in his motel room.

That brings us to the final at-
traction of Cotillion—the motels.
It’s really a delight to get out of
your stuffy Lexington room and
into a Roanoke motel with clean
sheets on the rollaway that you’re
sharing with four other people.
And the innkeepers are so nice.
They all say, “Glad to have you,
hope everything is all right, and
by the way the ice machine is
broken this week-end.”

Meanwhile the Hollins Inn con-
tinues to sell so much beer that
soon they’ll have enough money
to put in a men’s room, and the
University Cleaners is making a
fortune getting stains out tux(s)
(es) (0) (tuxedos). Plastic pocket
liners will go on sale at the co-op
for a dollar three eighty.

English Critic
Will Speak Wed.

An English critic of American
literature will discuss “The Aes-
thetic Delusion” Wednesday in a
public talk.

Montgomery Belgion, secretary of
the Westwood House School Trust
since 1950, will speak at 8:15 p.m.
in duPont Auditorium.

A former journalist and the author
of 11 books, Belgion is a native of
Paris but a British subject by birth.
He is currently residing in London.

During World War I, he was editor
of the European edition of the New

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

I was very much interested in
the item printed in last Friday’s
Ring-tum Phi which discussed cer-
tain professors’ complaints regard-
ing the fact that they “do not have
the time, nor the encouragement, to
pursue their own interests.”

It is hard for me to take this
statement seriously. Many profes-
sors at Washington and Lee do not
properly manage what should be
their primary interest, that of teach-
ing in the classroom. One wonders
how a professor does spend his time,
when he comes to class ten to fif-
teen minutes late and begins by
saying, “Well, gentlemen, what ma-
terial do we have assigned for to-
day?” These men should first con-
duct their classwork properly before
devoting their energies to their “own
interests.”

Several of our professors find time
to conduct excellent classes as well
as to write various reviews, articles,
and books. How do these men find
the extra time that their colleagues
do not? What kind of “encourage-
ment” do these critical professors
need to have before they can prop-
erly pursue their own interests.

The second point of Friday’s ar-
ticle discussed the lack of “intellec-
tual atmosphere” at W&L. I agree
that there is definitely such a lack on
this campus—I think that both facul-
ty and students share the blame for
this situation.

The Washington and Lee student
realizes more of a social atmos-
phere than an intellectual one. A
man is judged by his fraternal affil-
iation rather than by his own indi-
vidual (and intellectual) merits.

The faculty has a great respon-
sibility for this lack of intellectual
atmosphere. If one word could sum
up the feeling or atmosphere of most
classrooms, that word would be:
boredom. While many courses are
not fascinating in every detail, the
professors seem to try to make the
presentation of ideas as unstimulat-
ing as possible. It is hard for a stu-
dent to become interested in a sub-
ject when the professor himself ap-
pears not to be interested in it.

Several members of last years’
freshman class are no longer at W&L
due in part to the fact that they
could not find intellectual satisfac-
tion here. Many students who now
attend W&L at first were eager to
pursue their academic goals, but now
they seek to find a rewarding exist-
ence apart from the academic realm.

I think that there is time avail-
able for professors to pursue their
own interests—as well as time for
proper classroom preparation—and
that if the members of the faculty
wish to help create an “intellectual
atmosphere” at Washington and Lee
they can try to make the class meet-
ing a challenge rather than a drud-
gery.

 

Sincerely,
BRUCE W. RIDER

Grapplers Top Pfeiffer;
Meet F&M Wednesday

Washington and Lee’s wrestling team, boasting consecutive
victories over The University of North Carolina and Pfeiffer
College, will entertain the perenially tough Franklin and Mar-
shall squad in Doremus Gym Saturday night.

 

Freshmen Edge
By Bridgewater

The freshman basketball team
fought off a second half rally by
Bridgewater edging the visitors 54-
52 to win their second game of the
season.

Led by Jerry Kowalski with 20
points, Dick Livingston and George
Madison, Coach Lyles’ Baby Gen-
erals were on top at half-time 31-
25, but needed a layup by Scott
Verner ten seconds before the final
buzzer to clinch the victory.

The first half was characterized
by sloppy ball from both clubs,
but W&L dominated the play and
jumped to the lead.

The Baby Generals place their 2-0
record on the line when they face
Greenbrier this Wednesday.

 

 

The Lexington-Buena Vista
Road Race was won by Bill
Braithwaite, W&L law student,
with a time of 33:23 last Saturday
afternoon.

The six and a quarter mile
course was covered by General
cross-country runner Mike Shank
in 40:24. Shank developed a
leg cramp and was unable to run
all out for most of the race. Fresh-
man harrier Andy Kilpatrick
turned in a time of 39:29.

 

 

* The Diplomats, who beat the Gen-

erals last year 19-9, are especially
strong in the lower weights and
heavyweight classes again this year
according to Coach Dick Miller.

Miller cites F&M’s match Friday
with VMI as a good indication of
how the Generals should fare Sat-
urday.

Yesterday against Pfeiffer the
W&L grapplers came out on top
getting decisions from Butch West,
Dick Albert and Herb Smith and
pins from Co-captain Dave Mont-
gomery and freshman heavyweight
Ken Boiarsky.

The Pfeiffer wrestlers proved
stronger in the middle weights as
W&L’s Mike Brumby (137), Chick
Owens (147), and Sandy Mersereau
(157) lost decisions. Owens dropped
the closest match of the afternoon
bowing to his Pfeiffer opponent
2-0.

The pressure was put on fresh-
man Boiarsky who took the mat
with the score standing at 14-9.

A pin by the Pfeiffer unlimited
would give them a tie in the team
score. The first year grappler dis-
pelled all worry as he flattened his
man giving W&L a 19-9 bulge and
their second win without a loss in
the 1961-62 season.

In the season opener against UNC,
the Blue and White were led by
Herb Smith’s pin and decisions by
West, Montgomery, Tom Stover,
Dick Albert and Co-captain Sandy
Mersereau. The final match score
was 20-6.

Generals Roli Over Bridgewater
ead Late Rally

As Faub

Washington and Lee’s Basketball
team scrambled back from a cold
first half and swamped Bridgewater,
67-49, Monday night for its first vic-
tory of the 1961-62 season.

The Generals dropped their open-
er to Virginia’s Cavaliers, 82-53, last
Friday.

Monday’s victory was a pleas-
ing sight after Friday’s exhibition;
but the win resembled a basket-
ball game for about only the first
ten minutes of the second half
when Rodger “Bip” Fauber, Bill
Ide, and Jon and Tom Supak
spearheaded a W&L rally which
put the Generals ahead to stay.

Led by the Supaks, who gave the
Generals steady play at guard, W&L
raced to a quick 8-2 lead and looked
like it might have a good-old score,
score, score night.

But the scene soon changed as the
Generals grew as cold as an alaskan
night and Bridgewater stormed
ahead.

John Edwards’ free throw with
5:50 left in the half boosted the
Eagles into a 17-16 lead which
they held until just before the
intermission buzzer.

et, Ide L

W&L left the court with a 29-27
halftime lead, but it needed some
fancy shooting by Fauber to get
this cushion.

With one second showing on the
clock, Fauber unleased a_high-
arcing jump shot from the center
circle. Like a guided missile the ball
zoomed through the basket as the
buzzer sounded.

Fauber Sparks Rally
Pesky Edwards tied the score
again to start the second half
with a short jump shot, but captain
Fauber and the Generals were final-
ly off to the races.

 

Fauber sank a lay-up and a free|
throw to give W&L a three-point}

lead.

Then in seven minutes of fast-
break, capitalize-on-your-oppon-
ents-mistakes basketball, the Gen-
erals breezed into a 52-38 lead.

During the rally, Ide contributed
seven points, Fauber collected six
points; Tom Supak got four points;
Jon Supak, two points; and Bill
Smith, one point.

Paterno Shines

Coach Bob McHenry then sent in
the substitutes and a third-string

 

freshman guard—Louis Paterno—
who appeared to be the best player
on the court Monday night—con-
tinued the Generals on their on-
slaught with ten points in the game’s
final seven minutes.

Paterno’s play demonstrated the
first spark of real desire, hustle,
and good aggressive basketball
like the Generals used so much to
their advantage in their upset
over Randolph-Macon and Vir-
ginia last year that has been
shown so far this year.

The Generals placed four men in

W&L Debate Team Returns From New York Happy, Despite Losses

Washington and Lee’s_ debate

not victorious” performance at the

said “Even though we lost this

would say that this was our best
showing since I have been coaching
the team.”

first perfect season in 47 years.

Gummey rolled up 363 yards in 78 carries, com-

pleted the only pass he attempted for 17 yards, re-
turned two kickoffs 50 yards and eight punts 103
yards, and scored 54 points.

Payne (195) starred at tackle for the Generals,
blocking one kick and recovering two other blocked
kicks and racing for touchdowns.

Goodwin 5-9, 200 pounds, was a savage-tackling
guard all season for the Generals.
