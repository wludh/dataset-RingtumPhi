University Continues To Expand
Program For Undergraduate Aid

Undergraduate financial aid at
Washington and Lee this year totals
$169,992—a $15,873 increase over the
1960-61 total—as the university en-
ters the second year of an expanded
scholarship-loan program.

Sharing in the total aid are 201
students—18 per cent of Washington
and Lee’s 1,061 undergraduate en-
rollment, according to James D.
Farrar, Director of Student Financial
Aid and Scholarships.

This year’s increase follows a
seven-year pattern of rising scholar-
ship aid at Washington and Lee.
In 1954-55, financial assistance to
students was $44,970. This figure rose
to $66,240 for 1956-57. Aid for the
1958-59 academic year jumped to
$119,280.

Some 200 students shared in $154,-
119 when the financial aid program
was expanded in September 1960.
Key feature of this new program is
a loan system through which appli-
cants for financial aid assistance have
an opportunity to borrow from
Washington and Lee at least a por-
tion of the cost of their education.
The remaining would be covered by
outright scholarships.

The $169,992 in aid to students this
year is being furnished through
scholarship awards, loans and on-

campus jobs, Mr. Farrar said.

In the 319-man freshman class, 59
new students—19 per cent of the
group—are sharing in $54,035 as

dowed scholarships, entirely admin-

and Lee, total $46,635.

By BILL

The United States is “still the strongest power in the world
though perhaps we have not projected this power as we
should,’ Hanson W. Baldwin, military editor of the New York
Times, told the corps of cadets of Virginia Military Institute

here Wednesday.

Troubadours Set To Open
Season Tuesday Evening
With “Boy Meets Girl”

The Troubadours, univer-
sity dramatic group, will open
its 1961-62 season Tuesday
night when the curtain rises

on “Boy Meets Girl.”

The play will run through Friday
at the Troub theater on Main Street.

A farce about the movie-making
world, “Boy Meets Girls” stars Scott
Iacone and Jim Applebaum as a
team of studio songwriters.

They become involved in the pro-
motion of a sensational baby star,
around which the play centers.

The Troubs in producing the play
have dabbled in songwritting and
movie-making according to Publicity
Director Andy Leonard.

Leonard said Applebaum and Ia-
cone have written a song for the
play entitled “There’s a Pain in My
Heart,” and “My Heart’s on My
Sleeve.”

He said that the second act begins
with a film short publicizing Happy
(the baby actor) which the Troubs
produced themselves.

‘said, although the USSR is expand-
ing more rapidly in areas relating
to military potential.

Speaking to the cadets for the
fourth time since 1955, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning military expert re-
viewed the United States and Rus-
sian positions in the major arms
fields. He said the United States is
still ahead in virtuaily every de-
partment except actual manpower.

Nuclear Subs

He declared nuclear submarines
“have transformed sea warfare. They
now are used strategically rather
than as guerrillas.”

The Russians, he added, have
seven to nine such vessels built or
building compared to more than 29
for the United States.

This country, he said, is well
ahead in piloted aircraft, in nuclear
weapons both from the standpoint
of quality and quantity and is
equal or ahead of the Russians in
missile development on an over-
all basis.

In space development, he added,
“we have nothing to be ashamed of

failed to understand the worldwide
psychological impact of such spec-

What makes an egghead at Wash-
ington and Lee? If anyone can quali-
fy, it would certainly be the same
four men who have become the
University’s representatives in the
G.E. Quiz Bowl.

Bill Lowry, Jim Campbell, Tom
Lybass, and Rick Anderson went
through extensive testing in com-
petition with 63 of the top minds
on campus before emerging as the
contestants who will be sent to New
York on Nov. 12 to face either Po-
mona or Amherst College with
W&L’s academic honor at stake.

There are some striking similar-
ities between the members of the
Quiz Bowl team. All except An-
derson are non-fraternity men,
and 3 graduated from public high
schools. Each of them attributes
his store of knowledge to a vast
amount of reading, accomplished
principally before college.

Bill Lowry, a junior, graduated
from a high school in Hobbs, New
Mexico. He takes courses in French,
German, history, comparative reli-
gion, and philosophy, his major. It
is not surprising that his outside
reading is channeled along his
schoolwork. But he confessed to
reading the Saturday Review, the
New Republic, and the National Re-
view; he subscribes to the Wash-
ington Post and the New York Times
Sunday edition.

 

Tom Lybass, a sophomore, also

Quiz Bowl Team Gets Facts
From Reading—And Reading

said that he had more time to read
when he was in high school in
Jacksonville, Florida, than he does at
present.

Lybass likes reading all types of
books ranging from novels to history,
to psychology and psychiatry. His
special loves are Shakespeare and
the Italian Renaissance. He is now
reading a Stendahl novel, some
German lectures, and two Shake-
spearean plays which remain out-
side his experience.

Jim Campbell is the only mem-
ber of the team who attended prep
school. A graduate of Lawrence-
ville at 15, he is still waiting for
his draft card as a W&L junior.
Campbell also did most of his
reading in prep school, and is
presently reading a book of
French poetry, a volume of Ger-
man quotations, Major Voices in
American Theology, and one or
two novels.

Rick Anderson, a senior from
Startex, South Carolina, is an Eng-
lish major. Another high school
graduate, he is now studying
Shakespeare, the Romantics, con-
temporary literature, French, and
German. Despite this number of
courses, he manages to do about two
hours of extra reading each day.
He reads all types of books—any-
thing that interests him. He feels
that his omnibus reading has given
him the wide background necessary
for his Quiz Bowl position.

Board’s Decision On King

By STEVE SMITH
Student opinion at Washington and Lee solidified against

‘|the action of the University Board of Trustees during the

past week as an atmosphere of indignation spread and strength-

ened.

A Ring-tum Phi poll indicated that the student body re-

 

Student Bar

Indicts Board

A resolution censuring the

Washington and Lee Board

of Trustees was passed by the
Student Bar Association on

_ | Wednesday.

The resolution reads as follows:
Whereas, the Board of Trustees of
this University has refused permis-
sion to a student group to sponsor

eS a lecture by Martin Luther King
#| upon this campus, and

Whereas, it is the considered
opinion of the Student Bar Associa-
tion of this University that such

# | action is an infringement of academ-

ic freedom and against the spirit
of intellectual inquiry which should
prevail upon this campus;

BE IT RESOLVED, therefore, that
the Student Bar Association is op-
posed to such infamous rulings by
the Board of Trustees.

 

Notice

The Young Republicans’ member-
ship committee will meet at 5 p.m.
Monday in the Student Union.
All fraternities are requested to send
one Republican representative to the
meeting.

The regular meeting of the club
is scheduled for 7 p.m. Tuesday in
the Student Union.

 

Freshmen Get
Fewer U’s

Freshmen this year totaled
up almost 100 fewer ‘U’s”
than last year’s class in the an-
nual “S” and ““U” reports giv-
en out to each year’s entering
class six weeks after the semes-

ter begins.

In the breakdown, 92 freshmen
got one U, 32 received two, 17 got
three, and three boys were issued
four Z’s. No one received more than
four.

This is a total of 219 unsatisfactory
reports out of 1,590 issued. Last year
316 U’s were given out.

Grade wise, the U’s shaped up like
this: “D’s,” 138; “F plus,” 41; and
“7 8.

According to Dean of Students
Frank J. Gilliam, this year’s fresh-
man class is “better prepared” than
last year’s class. He said there had

 

been a 20-point increase in college

board scores over the previous year.

 

sented the Board’s decision to with-
hold approval from Martin Luther
King as a campus speaker with
nearly complete unanimity.

Of students questioned, only one
was able to agree with the Board’s
decree; but the student was not
reconciled to the Board’s failure
to explain its decision to the
university.

General feeling seemed to run
most strongly over the fact that the
decision was apparently an abri-
trary one and was handed down to
the school without justification.

These were some of the best-ex-
pressed ideas on the subject:

“The Trustees had in mind the
good of the school,” said Pete Age-
lasto—“but looking from a student’s
point of view this appears debate-
able, as proved by the reaction. “It
is unfortunate that the school can
be treated to such speakers as Gold-
water and Norman Thomas and
be denied King, though all would
receive disagreeing views. It should
be the privilege of the University
to hear such speakers.”

W&L Image Harmed

Rosie Page said that the Board’s
withholding of approval “severely
tarnished the ideal of the Universi-
ty—as far as intellectual freedom
is concerned.” He noted the irony
of King’s being banned on the same
weekend as were the Hot Nuts, while
the Isley Brothers and Lloyd Price
were on display in the gym.

“They have no reason as far as I
can see in banning Martin Luther
King. There is no reason why the
man shouldn’t speak here, absolutely
none.”

“I myself am a segregationist,
but I see no reason why the Uni-
versity shouldn’t hear his argu-
ment.”

Faculty Objects

From a faculty point of view,
Dr. James Leyburn stated: “I
think it was a lamentable deci-
sion.” Leyburn termed the situa-
tion “terrible.”

L. R. Emmons of the biology de-
partment said, “I think it was a
terrible injustice. I see no reason
why the man shouldn’t be invited
to speak here.”

Bill Noell: “Certainly Dr. King is
a leader in a broad movement about
which all of us have deep emotional
and intellectual feelings. I think it a
shame that this student body will
not have a chance to hear his views
firsthand, and then have the addi-
tional opportunity to question him
about them.”

Mark Haeberle: Definitely Martin
Luther King should be here. Most of
the students, uninformed and not
exposed to this question, would

Discuss The American Press

By BILL ROBERTS

Some of the most interesting comments at last
weekend’s student press conference at Hamilton Col-
lege came from the two Communists correspondents—
from Poland and Yugoslavia—who attended.

Their ideas brought out very clearly the direct
opposition between their thinking and that of our own
countrymen,

Yugosolavia is not a member of the Soviet bloc
and Poland is allowed more freedom of thought than
Mr. K’s other East European satellites, thus we were
very fortunate to meet journalists from these two
countries.

It is hard to believe that Communism is here to
stay or that it has any widespread acceptance. How-
ever, we came away with the feeling that they as
individuals were just as sure that we are wrong as
we are sure that they are.

Zivko Milic of Yugoslavia, who has spent
several years in Southeast Asia, looked around at
the handsome Hamilton campus, the well-
dressed, well-fed students and their late model
cars and quoted for me some statistics on per-
sonal income in Asia, while P. G. Khrishnaya of
India threw in a few figures of his own. “It’s
fine for all of you to be conservatives here,”
Milic said, “but this won’t do for the whole
world. Why don’t you join us?”

Mr. Khrishnaya, who owns several newspapers
and a news service in India, just grinned at both of
us.

Mr. Khrishnaya did no damage to the impression
we have from Mr. Nehru that the Indians are not
exerting the moral leadership they should by taking
a stand against some of the more flagrant warlike acts
of the Soviet Union.

Earlier in the day he had said that he understood
that Americans were disappointed with Mr. Nehru’s
“neutralism,” and asked the students to speak out
“boldly” saying what they thought of Mr. Nehru.

The moderator, Richard Bricker of Hamilton, drew
a big laugh from every one except Mr. Khrishnaya,
when he drew back and said, “Well I don’t know if I
should say anything. I ought to remain neutral!”

The panel had spent a good deal of time discussing
their respective national presses. The foreign cor-
respondents wanted to know everything about our
college newspapers: where their financial support
came from, our editorial policies, how much freedom
we had to take our own editorial stands, what sort of
editorial campaigns we ran, the circulation of our
papers, and how the editors and staff members were
chosen.

We in turn wanted to know something about their
own newspapers. Several of us were particularly
curious about the status of the press in the two
Communist nations represented.

How objective was the press in Yugoslavia
and Poland?

“We don’t believe that there is an unpolitical press,”
said Zivko Milic of Yugoslavia. “We are very po-
litically-minded. The American press may try to hide
it, but they are not.”

“We don’t think we need to hide anything from our
people...in contrast to the time when we were
strongly influenced by the Soviet Union,” said Mr.
Milic.

Wladyslaw Pawlak of Poland, the only represen-
tative of a Soviet bloc nation at the conference, had
much the same attitude: “We think we are giving a
very fair coverage of what’s going on in the world.
We don’t claim to be objective and we're not trying
to be objective.”

The Polish press represents “a wide variety of
political affiliations,’ according to Mr. Pawlak.

Every correspondent on the panel discussion

I took part in Friday afternoon, including Messrs.

Milic and Pawlak, affirmed that all the material

he sent home was published and that he was

never instructed to slant his stories in any par-

ticular political direction.

“How objective is the U.S. press?” someone asked
Mr. Milic.

He stated that the American press “distorts” news.
He felt that while there may be little deliberate at-

tempt to distort news, “You have editorial boards,
advertisers.”

Mr. Milic challenged the college editors on the
panel to name one “liberal” paper, or one “leftist”
paper in the United States. He said that all United
States publications of this sort are “small reviews
or magazines, published by intellectuals. They are
starving.

“We think we are more objective than you,” he
concluded.

Asked about freedom of the press in Poland,
Mr. Pawlak told the students “You stand on the
basic policy of your country and government...
We don’t think we should exacerbate issues on
domestic affairs.

Americans mistook the fight over “freedom of the
press” in Poland several years ago, he pointed out.
“It was a discussion between the working journalists
and the government.”

The American press came under strong criticism
from panelists other than the two Communists. The
students themselves said the American press is too
“local” and should put more emphasis on international
affairs.

The students felt that too often our own news-
papers refuse to take a strong stand or take a stand
that is predetermined.

No Guts--No Glory

It will be a long time before the Martin
Luther King case is forgotten here. The in-
cident will be remembered not only as a vio-
lation of academic freedom, but also as the
time when a great many people began to
question seriously the direction of Washing-
ton and Lee’s leadership.

The United States is engaged in a fright-
ening struggle for world leadership. The de-
mand on the resources of courage and intel-
lect of every American grows daily.

We hope that Washington and Lee is do-
ing her part to develop these qualities in her
students.

But what does the University do to develop
courage and intellect? We fear she has done
precious little recently.

It took courage to drop subsidized foot-
ball in 1954. Where was the courage to invite
Martin Luther King?

It takes courage to institute bold innova-
tions in a course and hour system which ties
professors and students to the stale art of

synthesis rather than critical study. Instead
of the more demanding intellectual reform
we are given new buildings and new adminis-
trative aids. There is little wonder Washing-
ton and Lee life centers around the cock-
tail party.

While the virtues of the mind go, to a large
extent, unrewarded and unencouraged, physi-
cal exercise is discouraged even more. Sand
traps pass for tennis courts. Game periods
that would dishonor most elementary schools
pass for ‘‘Physical Education.” Varsity teams
spend thousands of dollars but intramural
fields cannot be marked properly.

General Lee is remembered here for more
things than his moral leadership. He was
an important academic innovator.

Washington and Lee is in a rut. We need
to follow the men who welcome useful change
and we need to be done with those who fear
any change will be for the worst. It is time
we stopped listening to excuses and pledged
ourselves to get the job done. Where is W&L’s
backbone?

 

Assimilation--Round Two

We fear Mr. Rutledge’s defense of the
Assimilation Committee printed in Tuesday’s
Ring-tum Phi was more impassioned than
reasoned.

Far from attacking the committee as “‘lax,”’
we feel that they do an exceptionally fine job
under the circumstances. The circumstances
are rather trying—attempting to decide what
a man should wear at any given time and
whether or not he should have greeted some-
one else at any given time.

The good judgment of the Assimilation
Cimmittee has long been a strong argument
for its continuation. It still is.

But does Mr. Rutledge really think W&L
would change into a “jeans and T-shirt”’
school? We can’t believe it. We do have our
share of people who prefer such attire. But

we still think most of the student body would
choose to wear coats and ties, just as they do
now.

Further, if so much pressure were not put
on students to wear coats and ties outside of
class, there might grow up a healthy awareness
that being nicely dressed doesn’t make up for
bad manners. Ask any Lexington resident—
W&L students seem to feel that the coat-and-
tie makes even the most elementary courtesies
unnecessary.

You just can’t legislate gentlemen.

And, Mr. Rutledge, instead of sitting
around in court up there in the Student
Union on Tuesday nights, wouldn’t you and
your committee rather simply administer a
few quick pushups to freshmen when you
caught them without their beanies?

 

Comments

Speak Up!

The faculty and student body will have
an opportunity this week to join the petition
being circulated by Mr. Lowry, which con-
cerns a recent decision endangering the right
of free inquiry at Washington and Lee.

There is not much more that either the
Ring-tum Phi or Protest can say. It is up to
the student body to stand up for the rights
that are supposedly guaranteed it by the Uni-
versity. The petition is the only way for you
to be heard, even if the words fall on deaf
ears.

Let us not display any more of the kind of
courage currently being exhibited here. Sign
the petition.

We ourselves differ with Dr. King on a
number of points. Matter of fact, we had
some questions to ask him. We resent very
deeply not being given the opportunity to
ask him those questions.

S&U’s

This year’s freshman class probably has
fewer “U’s’” on their six-week reports than
any previous class. Their record is a credit to
their preparation and motivation.

It is also evident that academic competi-
tion will be much tougher than it has been in
the past. Students who did poorly on the
**Sa¢U’s” are well-warned, we are sure. Wash-
ington and Lee, for all her faults, is no breeze.

 

Mildew, ’66, Discusses WGL Courses

just about every educated man ought

By STEVE HENRY

September 24, 1965
Dear Mother and Daddy,

Well, rush week is finally over
(I’m a wreck), and I thought I
would drop you a few lines about
the courses I’m taking this semester,
since you are both so interested in
what I’m doing up here.

Well, I'll tell you, I have really
got some hard courses this year, and
I don’t know if I’m ever going to
make it out of here now that they’ve
got this new program that every-
body’s so crazy about.

Take my sociology course, for
instance. It’s called White Suprem-
acy 101—A Study of the Master
Race. Believe me it looks like a real
monster, even though I like my pro-
fessor, who used to teach in the
commerce school but got switched
over after the big shift happened.

It’s going to take a lot of outside
reading—lI can tell that already. The

main problem is having to subscribe |
to all those Mississippi newspapers, |

which are expensive and all that.
They used to have newspapers in the
library until they closed it. Now
you have to walk all the way to
McCrum’s to get the papers unless
they’re delivered to the house.

 

And, my God, you wouldn’t be-
lieve this religion course I’ve got.
It’s Comparative Religion 256, the
Various Branches of the Episcopal
Church. You know, it looks like
since everybody going here is Epis-
copal that this would be an easy
course, but it sure isn’t. You both
would be real surprised, I bet, if
you really started doing some serious
research into the church, with
broad-minded viewpoint and all. I
sure was.

My best subject, as always, is
history. This semester I’m taking
a dandy history course called His-
tory 290, which is a Civil War course
dealing with the period between the
attack on Fort Sumter and the
Battle of Bull Run. They used to
teach a course called History 291,
which was all about the rest of the
war, but they’ve discontinued it,
thank goodness. No one wants to
hear about all those awful things,
anyway.

Why I ever got into a commerce
course, I'll never know. My course in
Tobacco and Cotton Marketing is
just horrible, even though I know
it'll be invaluable when I get out
in the world and have to go it alone.
I am sure glad in a way that I’m
taking the course, because I believe

to have a little business sense. Like
you've said so many times, Daddy,
“a well-rounded man knows a little
about everything.”

The last course I’m taking is the
one I told you about this summer.
You know, the advanced political
science course that I had to try out
for last spring called Insular Diplo-
macy. Well, they tried to get a good
visiting professor here to teach the
course, and they sure did.

His name is Wayne Poucher, and
from what I hear, he used to be a
radio personality before he came
down here to teach. I’ve been to two
of his lectures already, and he sure
has some great ideas. I’ll guarantee

Interview With Major Roxbury

 

Atomic War: Our Alternatives

By TRACY HARRINGTON

“There is no such thing as a non-
atomic war today.”

With this statement, Major Ed-
ward J. Roxbury, head of the de-
partment of military science at W&L,
began defining “war” in the post-
World War II 20th Century.

In an informal interview, he gave
his ideas on the liklihood of war
and the kind of war he thought
would probably be fought.

“We may be able to fight a non-
active atomic war, but any war
today would have to be atomic,” he
said.

Maj. Roxbury defined “atomic
war” as the use of any weapons
that “produce a mushroom-shaped
cloud.”

A non-active atomic war would
be simply the conflict up to the time
atomic weapons were used.

Maj. Roxbury said that “we can-
not hope for non-atomic war with
Russia.”

Room for Trust?

“In the first place,” he said, “what
assurance have we that Russia would
keep an agreement not to use atomic
weapons? We don’t believe anything
she tells us now, and she doesn’t
believe anything we tell her.

“As soon as an attractive, lucrative
target is presented to one side or
the other, they may use atomic
weapons—especially if they start
losing a non-active war.”

What are the chances of avoiding
total war altogether?

Maj. Roxbury smiled at this one. |
“If war is to cease,” he said, “we|*

must assume that human nature has
changed, that we are smarter than
our ancestors, and that we have an
immediate solution to the problem of
a world-wide set of values.”

“There have always been wars,”
he said.

He said that whether or not we
enter a war depends to a great deal
on cost versus gain.

“Limited” Wars

For instance, he cited the wars
presently going on in Vietnam and

 

Laos. “We can afford liimted war
in these countries,” he said, “con-
sidering man-power available and
gain from the conflicts.”

What about limited war in Europe?
Can we afford or do we have the
alternative of limited war there?
Maj. Roxbury was dubious.

“We probably don’t have enough
force for a limited war in Germany.

“It is a question of whether or
not such a conflict is acceptable both
to the United States and Russia. And
even if it is acceptable, there is
some doubt as to its availability to
us.”

Backtracking for a moment, Maj.

 

Major Roxbury

Roxbury clarified just what is meant
by “limited” and “total” war.
“Limited war,” he said, “is any-
thing short of total war—and total
war is the aim to destroy completely
the enemy’s ability to strike back.”
He lauded President Kennedy for
trying to “make limited war possible
once again in Europe.” He said that
it is “extremely doubtful” that we

have the alternative of limited war
in Europe now, and specifically in
Germany.

Several Possibilities

What about survival? Is it possible
to go through an atomic holocaust?

According to Maj. Roxbury, “the
presumption is that we can.

“We would lose tremendous num-
bers of people, but if atomic wea-
pons are employed in militarily
proper way, we would probably sur-
vive.

“If and when this country enters
a full-scale atomic world war, it
must be with the awareness of
certain pre-determined political ob-
jectives. And in that war, we must
be ready to endure until those ob-
jectives are met.”

Harsh Realities

What are those objectives? Major
Roxbury described “what we must
do” in chilling terms.

“When we enter a war, we must
decide that we will carry the thing
on after New York and Moscow
disappear.

“We must decide to fight on until
we are able to dictate the peace—
notice I said dictate the peace, not
win. Nobody will win.”

As a military man more in the
know than the average citizen, how
does Major Roxbury feel personally
about a war?

“The thought of a war now scares
me to death,” he said.

He added, referring to an eventual

|| conflict with the U. S. S. R., that

“time is on our side.”

He said that world revolutions
have always become parochial, and
eventually they begin to compromise
with existing systems.

“They take (ideas) from you,
and you take from them.”

An educated militarist, then, pre-
sents this picture: either probable
atomic war with the communist
world, or eventual integration of de-
mocracy and communism.

Either way, the picture isn’t the
prettiest one.

 

Austrian Scholar Likes America,
But Criticizes Attitude Abroad

By ROBIN WOOD

Alfred Schmalfuss is an Austrian
public school teacher who received
a Fulbright scholarship in 1948 and
studied in the United States at the
University of Cincinnati. In Vienna
this summer I asked him about his
first impressions of our country and
how he regards Americans today.

“The boat trip ever was somewhat
of a harrowing experience,” laughed
the large, balding professor. “We
were traveling on an old U.S. Navy
transport ship filled to the brink
with GI’s who had not seen their
homeland in four years. Well, the
captain didn’s know we were stu-
dents and he put us on KP and made
us swab the deck with the rest of
the grimy crew.”

“T must admit I was rather scept-
ical about the whole situation,” con-
tinued Mr. Schmalfuss, “but my
opinion of the American people was
quickly changed upon landing at
New York. The first thing I wanted
to do was to buy a hot dog, so I
went into a small restaurant near
the dock. A great big, fat woman
behind the counter recognized me
as a foreign student and wished me
good luck and really made me feel
comfortable for the first time since
I had left Austria.”

The American college campus
favorably impressed the young
Austrian. He considered most of
the students very affable and
courteous, and he was overwhelm-
ed by the way Americans went
out of their way to help and give
him assistance.

“There wasn’t anything that they
wouldn’t do for me.”

After his first year at the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, Mr. Schmal-
fuss wanted to see more of this
country, so he set out alone to
hitchhike across the United States.
He spent the entire summer of 1949
traveling through the western and
southwestern states.

“The experiences of that summer
are still vivid in my memory, and
I will always cherish them,” he
reminisced.

 

When Mr. Schmalfuss returned to
his home in Vienna, he immediately
applied for immigration papers, for
he thought that America was the
most wonderful place that he had
ever seen. He was willing to dissolve
all family bonds and relationships
and make a new start in life in a
country where there was unlimited
opportunity and prosperity.

But Herr Schmalfuss’s dreams
were destined not to come true.
President Truman curtailed the im-
migration quota, and he was placed
on the waiting list where his name
still remains today.

Now that it has been twelve years
since his visit to America, Profes-
sor Schmalfuss doesn’t believe that
he could make a new life in Amer-
ica, though he does want to visit
our country again.

“Twenty to thirty are the de-
cisive years of one’s life. After
thirty you don’t want to pull up
roots and start all over again.
You ask yourself whether life
will be better than before.”

“Vienna has a culture which I
have grown to love—the Opera, the
concerts at the Rathaus, the rich
historical heritage. I have learned
to see the good with the bad, and
I realize that my people are not so
horrible after all. I don’t believe that
America could fill the void in my
life if I were to leave Vienna and
the Austrians now.”

Mr. Schmalfuss’s opinion of Amer-
icans has not been radically changed.
He thinks that Americans, in gener-
al, are “practical” people, except for
two matters. He can’t understand
why we hold our knife in our right
hand and cut and then go through
the awkward procedure of transfer-
ing the fork from our left hand to
our right in order to eat. To him,
this is highly unpractical and non-
sensical. Secondly, he can’t reconcile
the fact why most students and many
business men will not carry their
papers and books in a briefcase.

If this were all that Mr. Schmal-
fuss felt was wrong with Americans,

To the Editor:

In your recent editorial, “Con-

 

servative Chaos,” you state that
“Above all, we hoped that the So-
ciety would attempt to state clearly
the principles of conservatism, show-
ing that the principles could be
practically applied to national gov-
ernment.” The whole editorial is
predicated on the assumption that
this attempt was to be our sole
purpose. While this is to be one of
our purposes, it is not the sole pur-
pose. Additionally, we should like
to provide an open forum for sin-
cere inquiry into vital isues of na-
tional and international significance.

We do not believe that the Friday
editors necessarily endorse the views
of M. L. King solely because they
defend the right of another campus
organization to inquire into them.
Because Mr. Goldsboro spoke at the
invitation of the conservative society,
it does not necessarily follow that
the society indorses his views in
toto, nor is it to be implied that
the society is in total disagreement
with the speaker or the film. If the
writer of this editorial had not pre-
conceived for us the sole purpose
of our society, his “intelligence”
would not have been offended.

I-M Tennis Finalists

By HOWIE KORMAN
The I-M tennis championship enters its final round today
when Beta meets Phi Kap on the lower courts. In the double-
elimination tournament, Phi Kap is undefeated, while Beta has

lost one match.

On October 26, Beta stayed alive by ousting PiKA from

the tourney by a score of 3-2. The*

winners took an early advantage
when Ray Gordon downed John
Graham 6-1, 6-0, and Ron Hornbur-
ger defeated Greg Lebediv 6-2, 6-2.

In the doubles, John Gillet and
Al Painter of PiKA won 6-3, 6-1,
while teammate Fred Webb was
evening the match at two victories
apiece by outplaying Whit Fitzpat-
rick.

 

Bowling Rules
Are Published

The followin regulations regard-
ing intramural bowling have been

released by the I-M office.

1. Teams must report according to
schedule. Failure to be at the alley
within 15 minutes of the scheduled
time will result in a forfeit.

2. A double forfeit will be called
in the event that both teams fail
to appear.

3. Teams which forfeit will be re-
sponsible for the cost of the alleys
for themselves and their opponents,
unless, of course, the opponents
choose to remain and bowls for their
own pleasure in which event the
amount forfeited will be equal to
the cost which the fraternity would
have expended had they bowled.
This sanction will not be imposed if
either the senior I-M manager or
the manager of the bowling alley is
notified of the intended forfeiture
24 hours in advance of the sche-
duled match.

In the deciding match, top singles
player Steve Parel took the open-
ing set from PiKA’s John Trible
6-0, only to have Trible rally from
an early deficit to tie the second
set 6-6. Parel then managed to
break through his opponent’s service
and hold his own to win the con-
test for Beta, 3-2.

The winners’ only defeat in the
tournament was at the hands of
the team they will face this after-
noon, Phi Kap.

Swimming

On October 24, the I-M swimming
finals were held after the peliminar-
ies had been completed on the
previous night. The natators from
Sigma Chi captured three first
places, while Delt and Pi Phi each
captured two.

The only double winner of the
evening was freshman John Wolfe
of Sigma Chi. Wolfe edged out
Bruce Jackson in the 200-yard free-
style with a time of 2:10.4, while
he also won the 100-yard individual
medley in 1:05.1.

Pi Phi was victorious in both
relays. Their swimmers turned in
times of 1.21.8 and 1:39.9 in the

Fohs Too Light
For NFL Ball,
Says Coach Mac

Washington and Lee Head Coach
Lee McLaughlin, who played some
pro ball with the Green Bay Pack-
ers of the National Football League
during his playing days, got a let-
ter from the Packer front office the
other day.

They wanted to know more about
this linebacker named Terry Fohs,
who was an All-American candidate
for Coach Mac’s undefeated Gen-
erals.

McLaughlin wrote and told the
Packers that Terry was a mite too
small for pro ball.

“You'll never find a tougher man,
though,” he added.

McLaughlin says that Fohs play-
ed perhaps his finest college game
against Johns Hopkins last week.

Fohs, assigned to meeting Hop-
kins’ single-wing power head-on,
was credited with more than 20
tackles.

Blain, Hyatt

A center and a punter also came
in for special praise from McLaugh-
lin after last Saturday’s 36-6 win.

Center Jerry Hyatt made seven
bulls-eye centers to end Dan Blain,
who boomed seven punts for a 41.5
average that kept the Generals out
of trouble and the Jays on the
defensive.

General followers can expect to
see more of sophomore halfback
Stu Yoffe. He ran the ball only
three times against the Jays, but
picked up 78 yards in the process,
including a 19-yard TD run during
which he literally ran over a Hop-
kins defender.

* * *

Doug Martin, W&L’s 155-pound
All-State fullback, returned to his
1960 form against Hopkins, scoring
twice on runs of eight and 62 yards.

On both occasions, McLaughlin
wild-carded Martin with the instruc-
tions “,get us a touchdown.”

Generals Meet Wasps

Emory & Henry Toughest

 

Booters Get
2nd Victory

The General booters won their
second game of the 1961 season by
defeating King College, 10-3, Thurs-
day at Wilson Field.

Playing better than in their pre-
vious games, W&L was able to
penetrate the weak defense of their
opponents almost at will.

The first period saw Dave Knight,
last year’s captain, contribute three
goals for the victors. Also scor-
ing for the Generals was Steve
Hibbard.

During the second period, W&L
continued to use the fast break and
effective passing to score three more
goals.

The third period saw Knight
leading the General offense again,
but with the aid of freshman star
Gil Slingerland and Charlie Sweet.

Finally in the fourth period, Coach
Lyles was able to use his 3rd string
and the game ground to a standstill.

The Generals’ next game is with
Roanoke on November 3.

Opponent On

’61 Schedule

It’s been some time now since Washington and Lee’s Coach
Lee McLaughlin has had the opportunity to assume the college
coach’s favorite role—the underdog.

But McLaughlin, in good conscience, says his undefeated

Generals (4-0) might well be

the underdogs in their home

engagement with powerful Emory and Henry (4-1).
“I’m willing to accept Coach Stokely Fulton’s evaluation

of our team when he says Emory*
and Henry is the best team Hamp-
den-Sydney has played this year,”
says McLaughlin. “Of course, we’re
going to do our level best Saturday
to prove he’s wrong.”

But, adds the W&L coach with a
solemn expression, “There’s no doubt
about it, we’re going to have a tiger
by the tail this week.”

Common Foe

Hampden-Sydney is the only com-
mon foe the Wasps and Generals
have faced. W&L had a rough time
in defeating the Tigers, 7-6, and
E&H had a relatively easy go of it,
winning 16-0 last Saturday.

“We're certainly not expecting
Emory and Henry to spot us an
eight-point gift in the first period,
like the last three teams we've
played have done,” McLaughlin
points out.

On the basis of scouting reports
and movies of Emory and Henry
games, McLaughlin is obviously im-

 

 

pressed by the way Coach Casto
Ramsey’s Wasps play the game.
“They’re big, but that’s not what
bothers me the most,” says Mc-
Laughlin. “It’s the way the carry
the game to the team they’re play-
ing. They hit hard, and keep hitting.”

Stand-Outs

McLaughlin singled out All-State
end Levi Otey, fullback C. A. Bur-
ton, halfbacks Harry Yost and Bob-
by Magill, and freshman quarterback
Randy Atkinson as the key men in
the Wasp attack.

The general situation for Sat-
urday’s game is much the same as
it was last year at mid-season for
W&L. The Generals have won four
games and are unbeaten, they’re
facing the team they feel will give
them their toughest test, and its
Parents’ Weekend, just as it was
last year when Johns Hopkins came
to town. The Jays were unbeaten,
and stayed that way holding the
Generals to an 8-8 tie. The Wasps
aren’t unbeaten, but they’ve won
four straight.

Coach McLaughlin expects his
squad to be in good physicial con-

150-yard medley and the 200-yard
freestyle.

Phi Kap captured its only first
place as James won the 50-yard
freestyle in 24.1 seconds. Pete Pres-
ton of Phi Psi was second in 25.0
seconds.

The 100-yard butterfly was one
of the closest races of the schedule
as Dick Warwick of Delt put on
a finishing spurt to edge Phi Psi’s
Walt McManus. The winning time
was 1:06.4.

Nick Monsarrat, Delt, won the
100-yard feestyle in 57.2 seconds.
SAE Will williams was second, only
one second off the pace.

In the 100-yard backstroke, frosh
Broaddus of Sigma Chi won easily
as he coasted to the finish in 1:09.0.

KA’s Ship Chase outraced Jackson,
Delt, in the 100-yard breaststroke
to win that event in 1:15.2. Chase
also took the runnerup spot in the
100-yard individual medley.

On October 25 the diving finals
were held with Dave Geer, Phi
Delt, capturing the event. Dick Al-
bert of SAE was second to the win-
ning freshman.

Football

In Division A of the I-M football
program, PiKA remained undefeated
by downing Phi Psi 19-0 on Wed-
nesday, October 25. Nicky Smith led
the way for the victors as he scored
on a six yard run and passed 40
yards for a T-D. Senior Bev Dubose
accounted for the other score as he
raced 30 yards for the final points in
the fourth period.

Also on Wednesday, Beta downed
KA 7-0, but the results are not of-
ficial because a protest has been
field. A decision will soon be hand-
ed down by the I-M Board.

Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi both
won their contests on October 24.
Sigma Chi kept its record unblem-
ished by easily upending SPE 28-7.

In the closest game of the season
DU edged ZBT 7-6. On the first play
from scrimmage, Jim Conrad inter-
cepted a ZBT pass and raced 70
yards untouched for the initial score.
The important PAT was good on a
roll-out to senior Pete Conrad. Fol-
lowing DU’s kickoff, Art Sher took
a lateral and raced 60 yards for the
final points of the game with three
minutes remaining in the first period.

In their opening game of the sea-
son, ZBT overran a unit from Pi
Phi, 19-0. Sophomore Bill Solmson
was Outstanding as he hit his left
end for two perfect TD tosses.

benefit greatly; for there is more
to this racial problem than meets
the eye. Newspapers don’t tell the
whole story. King could enlighten
us. I don’t see how the Board could
think this way.”

Ken Boiarsky: “I don’t see any
reason why King shouldn’t be
allowed to come here. This event
has shown that it ought to be
more clearly defined by the school
who should be able to come here
and who should not.”

Frank Wright: “A lot of bad opin-
ion and earnest criticism will come
from this decision. I think King
should be allowed to come here,
especially since he would have to
speak on a defined topic.”

Ray Robrecht: “I was sorry to see
the decision because I think it has
really shaken the confidence of
the student body in the University.
This insults the intelligence of the
students. I agree with the stand
taken on this matter by the Ring-
tum Phi.

No student could be found who
really supported the action of the

ponents of King in the student body

speak and wanted to hear his views.

foremost matter of argument on

we certainly would command his
unquestioned respect and admira-
tion. Yet, this is not the case. I
think we would do well to heed his
final evaluation of our attitude and
not just brush it off, saying he is
bitter and jealous of us.

“Americans think they are the
greatest nation in the world be-
cause of their living standards.
They judge all other people by
their own standards and do not
try to comprehend another way
of life, which may be far superior
to theirs. They must learn to take
criticism and not be flattered by
people who may be trying to use
them. Americans must take a sec-
ond look at themselves, especially
when they are in a foreign coun-
try; they must realize that the
U. S. has made a lot of mistakes
and that they have not been right
in everything they have done.”
