Book Store Will Carry
Full Line Of Paperbacks

By MALCOLM MORRIS

The University Supply Store has
announced plans to enlarge its book-
store selection to include a full line
of paperback books by next Sep-
tember, and a partial line by May 21.

James L. Sumner, supply store
manager, said the project will be on
an experimental basis, in accord-
ance with a trend on the college to-
tody.

The store will carry titles from
such publishers as Colliers, Doubl-
day-Anchor, and Barnes and Noble.
Plans include several new racks
devoted to the paperbacks.

A faculty committee headed by
Dr. David Sprunt has supervised the
selection of books to be made avail-
able.

Each department and the profes-
sors within the department choose
the paperbacks which are of value
in its subject range. A wide range
of topics is expected to be carried.

Dr. Sprunt said that the paper-
backs will range over and above text
books. We are trying, he said, to
make available books of interest and
also of value to students.

The books will average from 65c
to $1.50 in cost, said Sumner.

 

Paperbacks Boom

The “paperback revolution” on
college campuses has vastly increas-
ed the number of books bought by
students, according to the New York
Times “Book Review” of January 14,
1962. In an article on college read-
ing the magazine pointed out that
the majority of top-selling books on
campuses are in paperbacks.

The fact that college bookstores
are now the best markets for these
paperbacks has been prompted by
their wide range of topics, availabil-
ity and inexpensiveness.

J. D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye
is generally regarded as the most
popular book among college stu-
dents, with Salinger also considered
the most popular author.

On Ivy League campuses Gold-
ings paperback Lord of the Flies,
a work which has found a great fol-
lowing at W&L, is running a close
second to Salinger. Albert Camus
and his plague are also extremely
popular.

Good translations of foreign books
into paperbacks have given a great
impetus to the popularity of such
writers as Camus, Pasternak, Satre,
Ayme, and Moronte.

Troub Review

Tim Morton
Outstanding
In ‘Zoo Story’

The Troubadours gave the W&L
audience a good introduction to the
plays of Edward Albee in their per-
formances of The American Dream
and The Zoo Story Wednesday night.

They played The American Dream
as a hilarious bit of social satire,
which it is. But they were so funny
that the audience laughed it way
past most of the sordid reality be-
hind the comedy.

Tim Morton, with able backing
from John Dunnell, turned in the
best performance of the night in
The Zoo Story. Morton, in the role
of Jerry, exercised a sure hold on
the audience as he described his at-
tempts to communicate with a sing-
ularly nasty dog.

 

By contrast with the sure manner
in which Morton and Dunnell play-
ed to each other in The Zoo Story,
the players in The American Dream
seemed to lack coordination. Mrs.
Lyman Emmons, as Mommy, and
Miss Josephine Unger, as Miss Bark-
turned the normal social

er, con-
versation upside down.
The comic parts were so over-

played, however, that the audience
never seemed to realize that the
play deals with a couple who are
incapable of human love or friend-
shop, who mutilate their adopted
child and ignore an aging grand-
parent. Accordingly, when Nick
Denton came on, splendidly hand-
some and empty as the former child’s
twin, grown up and suffering spirit-
usually the physical loss of his broth-
er, the audience was unprepared to
accept the basic reality of the situa-
tion.

The Zoo Story is a more conven-
tional play than The American
Dream, and the audience, who ex-
pected good performances from Mor-
ton and Dunnell, almost shook off
the effects of their surfeit laughter in
the first performance,

Performances tonight and tomor-
row night of the two plays will
give people who haven’t yet seen
them a chance to do so, They are
both enjoyable and disturbing.

and spoiled young man,” and

on ——**the nation is becoming aware of

having been deceived by him.

‘Anathema to Democracy’

The “infinite and magnificent con-
ceit” of Kennedy and his govern-
ment has brought them to concen-
trate power and privilege in the
capital, said the Texas Republican.
The New Frontier regime is “based
on the accumulation of power and
its arbitrary exercise.” Kennedy, he
said, has no confidence “in the abili-
ty of people to meet their problems.”

This tendency to marshall and dis-
tribute all resources in and from
Washington was called an anathema
to democracy; the government is
becoming less responsible to the peo-
ple, said the Texan.

In facing down the steel industry
recently, Kennedy acted like a petu-
lant child, said Tower, who called
the rise in steel prices “justified.”
Whether the raise was right or
wrong, he said, it was wrong for
the President to bludgeon steel with
the power of the government.

Tower felt that Kennedy has
proven himself anti-business, and
| that the President would not be
likely to use such brutal tactics in
dealing with labor unions.

Tower called the administration’s
medicare plan a “cruel deception”
and another way to inject Federal
control into a realm where it does
not belong. The Senator described
the U.S. medical system as the best
in the world, and sees no reason to
tamper with it.

Makes FDR Look Reactionary

Kennedy’s administration has gone
so far in centralization that FDR
now compares as a_ conservative,
Tower said. It’s a pretty sad state of
affairs when “FDR starts looking like
a reactionary,” he said.

Tower said he feels a growing
awareness in America that we are
going too fast in this direction, and
a growing determination not to con-
tinue in it is “particularly manifest
in young people.” The Senator sees
a “rising tide of conservatism on
the college campus.”

Today’s youth also, he said, are
| moving forward in a search for op-
| portunity, not security. The impres-
| sive growth of America, said Tower,
is traceable to the opportunity of-
fered here; this system is what con-
servatives seek to preserve.

In a brief comment on the con-
servative nature, Tower character-
ized his thinking as dynamic rather
than static.

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

IFC Rush Plan:
An Appraisal

The IFC’s proposal has passed one vote, and must now be
passed again. The proposal certainly has its merits, but it is not
without its faults.

 

As we understand it, the new plan is designed to alleviate
the strain that early rush imposes on incoming freshmen. It
is argued that the excitement and, quite often, the disappoint-
ment of the present rush system serves to start the freshman
off with a warped sense of values. This argument is, of course
a generalization, but it probably contains more than a little
truth. The IFC’s plan, with its period of adjustment, would
help rectify this problem.

The new plan, however, could very well create more prob-
lems than it would solve. Like it or not, fraternities are a fact
of life on this campus, for they are the primary means by
which a student may become acquainted with the characteris-
tics that distinguish Washington and Lee from other schools.
This is an important service, but it is one which has been ser-
iously impaired since the advent of the Commons three years
ago. Fraternity influence over freshmen has been irreparably
damaged simply because the individual house must now wait
a full year to effectively “assimilate” new students.

The new rush plan could concievably aggravate this sit-
uation. During their first month here, the freshmen will have
virtually no contact with upper-classmen, and, after rush, the
pledge period will be shorter. Fraternities will inevitably exer-
cise less influence over the freshmen, and the result could be
a further weakening of the assimilation process.

Certain members of the faculty feel that the fraternity
social life often conflicts with W&L’s academic life, and they
would like to reduce the influence that fraternities have on
incoming students. But these men seem to ignore the fact that
fraternities provide the framework for the assimilation process
here, and that a substitute for this process must be found if
fraternities are to be deprived of their hold on freshmen. Pre-
sumably, this fact was recognized when the Commons was built,
but, nevertheless, absolutely nothing seems to have been done
about it. As of now, the freshmen live by themselves, eat their
meals by themselves, and attend classes by themselves. They
have no means by which to orient themselves to life at W&L,
for the faculty advisory system provides almost no help, and
they have very little contact with upperclassmen. This year’s
dorm counselors have been complaining of the situation all
year, and Billy Atwell’s article on this page seems to bear out
their conclusions.

Ideally, the weakening of the fraternity hold on freshmen
would allow the faculty to shift the emphasis here from social
pursuits to academic pursuits. The faculty seems to think that
this process would be automatic, that de-emphasis of social life
would of necessity lead to an improvement of the academic
climate.

But the process is by no means automatic. It takes more
than classes six days a week to create an intellectual atmosphere.
There must be constant outside-the-classroom student-faculty
communication, and there must be a general air of intellectual
activity, which would include the best possible outside speakers
and scholars-in-residence. The economics and chemistry de-
partments excepted, student-faculty relations at W&L are re-
markably inadequate, and the outside speaker program, despite
the presence of Mr. Albee and Senator Tower this week, has
been poor this year. The initiative for improvement in these
areas must come from the faculty. If the faculty expects to
improve the academic climate at W&L, then it must take posi-
tive steps to assimilate the freshmen intellectually. The Com-
mons has all but eliminated the power of fraternities in this
area. It’s now up to the faculty.

Our only reservation about the IFC’s proposal is that it
may aggravate the present poor state of freshman assimilation.
If the faculty will accept more responsibility for assimilating
new students, then the threat will be removed, and the new
rush proposal may stand for what it is: a conscientious and
commendable plan to iron out the flaws in the present rush
system. If the faculty will not accept the responsibility, then the
new plan will only make a bad situation worse.

A University Party Jolt

Monday night’s revolt of the University Party majority in
the freshman class shook quite a few people up. It should have.
For upperclassmen have been growing more and more out of
touch with each year’s freshman class since the advent of the
Commons.

The freshmen in the University Party felt, rightly, that they
had had no voice in choosing their candidates for sophomore
class offices. So they just turned against their party candidates,
most of whom were able and well-liked men.

If there has been a failure in the two cliques’ nominating
process, it has been in nominations for freshman and sopho-
more class officers. The reason is that the clique meetings are

run by juniors and seniors with very little freshman or soph- |

omore representation. If the two parties are to be as responsive
to the feelings of the student body as they claim to be, they

 

 

must make greater provision for an underclass voice in their |

councils,

Morgan Condemns Walker

Letter to the Editor:

After thumbing past the beaming
picture of one Antoine “Fats” Dom-
ino on the front page of the Tuesday
R-t P, I discovered a more sombre
section of the paper in the “Letters
to the Editor” column on the next
page. In this rather sickening ex-
ample of the attitude which I fear is
fast becoming dominant at W&L,
the author, one Sam Walker de-
nounces everything from the stu-
dents’ capabilities of reasoning to the
University itself.

The author accuses W&L of being
nothing more than a post-graduate
high school, but in the light of his
arguments, he proves that the oppo -
site is true. He advocates more facul-
try control and suggests that the
faculty alone is capable of making
decisions for the student body. Real-
ly, Mr .Walker, doesn’t that remind
you of the good old days back at
at Home Town High? Or was there
an interest by the students in the
affairs of your high school, which is
apparently a sure sign of weakness
according to your letter? It would
seem to me that as a man becomes
older and more mature, he is more
able to participate directly in the
decisions of his school, not the re-
verse, which Mr. Walker loudly pro-
claims.

Here at W&L, there is, or has been
until recently, an excellent relation-
ship between the university and the
fraternities. It has been a relation-
ship which no other college can
claim because nowhere else has it
been as succesful. The scholastic
life and the social life at W&L have
been considered separate, neither
treading on the territory of the
other. Monday through Friday be-
longed to the Hill and the weekend
was the domain of the Fraternity. In
this way, a balance was achieved
by which both bodies prospered.

Now it seems that the faculty
feels it necessary to over-step its
limits and take fraternity action into
its own hands, giving as excuses
that the students are suddenly in-
capable or that the traditions of
dance weekends might be lost. The
real reason lies, however, in the
increased activity toward raising the
academic standards at W&L to place
W&L in competition with other in-
stitutions of its same size. This is
admirable, but what exists here
now— the union of university and
fraternity—is far more important.
Students apply at W&L because they
expect to find this union, whereas
at many other colleges such as Am-
herst, fraternities are little more than
places to live and study, lacking the

‘An Experience, Not A Play .

 

Albee Discusses Absurd Theatre

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Edward Albee doesn’t look like a
playwright. He’s slender, polite and
friendly, and gives the impression
of an intelligent, moderately con-
servative business man.

He appears alsost strikingly un-
ostentatious. The first thing one
notices about him, and remembers
the longest, is the penetrating stare
he levels at everybody with hard,
iron-gray eyes.

That this man represents a highly
controversial movement in modern
dramatic literature seems (if you'll
pardon the pun) absurd; but Edward
Albee, 34-year-old author of The
Zoo Story, The American D-cam,
and The Death of Bessie Smith, is
one of the most increasingly signi-
ficant protagonists of the Theatre of
the Absurd.

In an informal hotel room inter-
view with members of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi and French professor
Jay Laurence Taylor Tuesday, Albee
talked about himself, the Absurd
Theatre, and other playwrights.

If the play-goer wants to appre-
ciate an Absurd drama, he musé go
“not expecting a play, but expect-
ing an ‘experience’.” Albee said.
“Then you don’t have any percon-

ceptions and can absorb the thing for

 

 

what it is,” he added.

The theatre of the Absurd, in the
main, is an outgrowth of existential-
ist philosophy. Its playwrights deal
with the senselessness of society and
the world, and with man’s trying to
find some meaning where there is
none.

A movement that tries to do some-
thing like this is criticized primarily,
perhaps, for its brutal cynicism and
bitterness. One might expect its
proponents to be unpleasant non-
conformists with long hair and dirty
teeth, who converse in intellectual
ebscurities and falsely erudite ver-
nacular. Albee definitely isn’t one
of these.

Kind of an Explosion

He thinks about a play for a
while—“‘around six months’—and
then does the actual writing in a
relatively short time. The Zoo Story,
which opened Wednesday night at
the Troub Theatre with another
Albee play, The American Dream,
was “kind of an explosion. I didn’t
understand it myself,’ Albee said,
adding somewhat ironically “I have
to learn from others (critics) exact-
ly what I meant.”

The artist’s typical aversion for
critics was pointed out again in
Albee’s answer to an inquiry as to
what writers had influenced him.
“I have been influenced by every-

 

body I have read. Critics are always
saying who has influenced me: I
made a list once and stopped at 23.
Some of them I had never read.’

The Playwrights He Likes

He did say that there are four
20th Century authors whom he pre-
fers over others, these bein: Chek-
hov, Beckett, “the late” O’Neill, and
Brecht.

Someone commented to Albee on
the fact that his plays seemed to be
centered always in America. Ad-
mitting that this was true, he said
there is “an artificiality in writing
about foreigners in something he-
sides their own language.” He went
on to say it might be so that “if
a play is about Frenchmen, it should
be in French. I don’t try to write
about America—I guess it’s just
that I know America and American
problems better; and, after all, a
play can’t be set in limbo: logically,
it must be set someplace.”

Less Naturalistic

In discussing the future of the
Theatre of the Absurd, playwright
Albee felt that the trend weuld be
even more away from naturalistic
techniques. “The whole concept of
reality and illusion will be explored,
and Absurd plays will be less ‘easy’.’

Pressing Problem For Washington & Lee:
Top-Notch Freshmen Make Transfer Plans

By BILL ATWELL

Life at Washington and Lee has
undergone much discussion lately as
to what it should and does mean. An
atmosphere of dissatisfaction has
been noticed, particularly in the
freshman class.

Approximately 25 freshmen left on
their own accord at the end of the
fifst semester; rumor has it that 30
or so will leave at the end of
this semester.

Included in the group that plans
to leave after this semester are four
members of Phi Eta Sigma, of which
two are the number one and two
men scholastically in the freshman
class. Many of the others who won’t
return in the fall are boys with
above 2.0 averages.

Why the Mass Exodus?

Why is there this mass exodus of
seemingly top quality people? In
interviews with several transferring
freshmen, we have tried to learn
what they thought were the strong
and weak points about W&L.

The only man in the freshman
class with a 3.0 last semester was
Charles Osment. He’s leaving, and
his main reason for it is the lack of
necessary courses here in the field
of his planned major, medical re-
search.

 

In addition, however, he feels
there is a definite condition of men-
tal apathy among the student body.
“I don’t think Washington and Lee
can be called an institution of intel-
lectual inquiry where students learn
for the joy and satisfaction of learn-
ing.”

Fraternities at Fault

Osment also believes that the fra-
ternities should emphasize scholas-
tics more than they do at the pres-
ent. “Academics seem to take second
place to social activities,” he added.

When asked about what he saw
good in the University, Osment im-
mediately cited the Honor System
as the best attribute of W&L.

George James is a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, has done research in
English with Dr. Douglas Dav, and
was a member of the succesful W&L
Swimming team.

His leaving has been prompted
by what he calls desire for an urban
environment, as well as a larger
school with more courses in his
chosen field.

Intellectual Apathy

He also has been bothered by “in-
tellectual apathy among the fresh-
men.” He mentioned the social as-
pects of W&L as being over-empha-
sized a great deal.

 

“Bull sessions are stifling because
they seem to revolve around the
same nonsensical topics. I simply
get tired of listening to how niuch
someone can drink before he passes
out.”

The Honor System is the embod-
iment of what James considers to
be the good points of the school.
He, like Osment, expects it to be in
effect no matter where he goes to
school.

Mike Crabill was the second rank-
ed student scholastically in the
freshman class last semester, with
a 2.82 grade point ratio. His reason
for leaving is quite simple. “Met-
talurgical majors have trouble find-
ing courses to take here.”

Mike said that he had enjoyed his
stay and that his leaving was just
a question of completing his major.

Seeking Better Courses

John Rosenberg is a ZBT fresh-
man who plans to leave Washing-
ton and Lee at the end of this se-
mester. The desire to attend a larg-
er institution with a wider choice
of courses has prompted his decision.

John feels a sense of pride in the
Honor System and in “other tradi-
tions which are, unfortunately, pret-
ty much neglected.”

The opportunity to go to a large

 

school like Tulane and to be in a
big city like New Orleans has been
the prime factor in Lee Johnson, a
2.5 man, choosing to leave W&L.

“Anyone who has ever gone to
school in New Orleans will imme-
diately know why I’m leaving. Lex-
ington is so bad.”

Johnson was, like the others, im-
pressed with the Honor System.

In addition to freshmen transfer-
ring who have been quoted, there
are a number leaving who prefer
to make their remarys anonymously.
The following opinions are taken
from such students, all of whom
hold a grade average of 2.0 or better.

Simply Not That Difficult
I don’t see how this school could
possibly be ranked as one of the
top colleges in the country” com-
mented one freshman. “The school
is simply neither that good nor dif-
ficult.”

Another said that “even though
the faculty is generally distinguished
and their accomplishments should be
recognized, I don’t see them bring-
ing about a driving sense of intellec-

“

tual stimulation, or maybe what I
should call an electric atmosphere.”

A few students had remarks on
the present freshman curriculum.

Generals Battle For Ball With Tar Heels

Lacrosse Team To Face
Blue Devils Saturday

Washington and Lee’s goalie Ray Miller may prove to be
the deciding factor as the Generals come up against Duke this
Saturday in their 11th lacrosse match of the season.

The Generals, whose 1-9

record is almost identical to

 

Duke’s 1-8 record, will be counting* -

heavily on Miller and his 20 saves
per game average to keep the Blue
Devils out of the scoring column.
Miller who has an impressive tally
of over 200 saves in games this year,
has been selected as the South’s
goalie in June’s North-South Game.

With both teams going into Satur-
day’s fray carrying only one vic-
tory apiece, authorities have picked
it to be the closest lacrosse contest
of the weekend. Washington and
Lee managed to defeat Duke in ’59
and ’60 but gave up a close one
last year as the Blue Devils turned
in a 6-3 victory.

Duke, rated as a big, “hard-nosed”
team, will be on their toes this
weekend and shooting for another

victory to even the score for the
four game series. Little Jim Griffith,
5’5”, will be leading their attack as
their outstanding player. Rated as
one of the best attackmen to face
W&L this year, Griffin makes up for
his lack of size with brilliant stick-
work and speed. Outstanding de-
fenseman Mike Welsh will also be at
his best, aiming to give W&L’s Car-
roll Klingelhofer and Bob Hankey
a tough time around the Blue Devils’
goal.

Despite the fact that both teams
appear to be going into the game
fairly evenly matched the Generals
will have a definite advantage with
Miller in the goal since Duke’s goal-
ie has been rated as poor to fair.

 

NOTICE

Spring soccer practice will begin
this Monday. Practice will run 4:00

Cross-Country Anticipates
Excellent Season In Fall

By ANDY KILPATRICK

This fall the cross-country team will battle Washington and
Lee’s 4.1 mile course with one of the best teams in recent years.
The team will be led over the hilly terrain (the course is con-
sidered one of the toughest anywhere) by returning senior co-

 

country champ of W&L, having won
every race he started on the W&L
course this year, and having estab-
lished a school record of 24 min. 20
sec. on the lengthened course.

Entire Team Returns

The entire team will be returning
in the fall, as there were no seniors
on this year’s squad, and to give
it further depth, Coach Miller will
make every effort to recruit distance
runner Charlie Head and track star
Skip Essex. If Coach Miller can
succeed in convincing these boys
that Telegraph Hill (an obstacle
which is the point of truth about
two miles out on the course) is not
as steep or as long as it really is,
the team could develop into a really
superior group, especially with the
aid of some good freshmen.

Other returning runners will be
Bruce MacDonald, Dillard Munford,
Dave Mosbaugh, Gene Friedburg,
Mark Gee, and Bob Farrar.

Season 7-2

The team this year marked up a
7-2 season by defeating Randolph-
Macon, Lynchburg, Fairmont State,
Richmond, and Dickinson, and ob-
tained forfeits from Pfeiffer, and
Hampden-Sydney. W&L lost only to
strong Bridgewater and F&M teams.

Richmond, Dickerson, and Hamp-
den-Sydney have been dropped from
the schedule for 1962, but Norfolk
William and Mary and Roanoke
have been added.

After the state meet in Lynchburg
there will be two road races which
will challenge even the stoutest of
of runners. These races are the
Lexington-Buena Vista road race
(which, as everyone knows, is six
miles), and the Blacksburg-Chris-
tianburg road race, a nine mile af-
fair for anyone interested in running
nine miles.

Generals Lose
Close Decision

To ’Macon

The Washington and Lee baseball
team came out on the short end of
another close decision Wednesday,
this time losing to Randolph-Macon
at Ashland. Hampered by errors,
the Generals yielded a 2-1 lead in the
last of the night, losing 3-2.

The team’s record now stands at
1-9.

The loss was especially tough for
Generals’ pitcher Phil Sharp who
turned in one of the best perform-
ances displayed by the Washington
and Lee pitching staff this year.
Sharp walked only one man and
struck out seven while giving up
seven hits.

Washington and Lee scored both
its runs in the second inning. Robin
Wood led off the inning by reaching
first on an error and was followed
by Jim Russ who hit a sharp single
op the middle. Ashley Allen hit into
a fielder’s choice leaving runners
first and third. Both runners then
scored on a long double by Bobby
Williams.

Besides Williams’ and Russ’ hits in
the second, Hobbs, Gilmore Martin.
and Allen each picked up singles.

The Generals bad luck plague
struck again in the ninth inning as
an error by Howie Martin allowed
the Yellowjackets to tie the count
at 2-2. The deciding run came across
with two out in the ninth as a
Randolph-Macon batter _ singled
home a runner from third.

Since Washington and Lee was the
guest team, the two-out blow spelled
a loss for the Generals without
another opportunity.

Delts Cop
I-M Title

The Delta Tau Delta, boasting a
grand total of 195 points in the spring
intramural tournaments has pulled
away from second place Phi Kap and
third place Phi Psi to capture the
championship.

Although it still has the finals
of the table tennis tournaments to
play against ZBT, its strong per-
formance in softball this season has
assured Delt the first place spot.

Beating both Kappa Sig and SAE
in softball tournament play Delt
walked away with the championship
leaving Kappa Sig in second place,
SAE in third and DU in fourth.

Tie, win or lose in the table ten-
nis playoffs, Delt still has clenched
the Intramural Championships as
neither the second or third place
teams have entered contestants in
either of the spring tournaments.

In Rain-Soaked Match

The Washington and Lee tennis
team scored a major upset over the
University of Virginia this Tuesday,
winning by a score of 3-2. Because
of rain the match was not finished
although it counts as a victory, since
more than half of the matches were
played.

Captain John Baker ran into some
unusually stiff competition as he
dropped his number one singles,
6-0, 6-2, But freshman Randy Jones
played beautifully in turning back
his opponent in short order, 6-1, 6-4.

close ties which the social life helps
to create.

Returning to Mr. Walker’s letter,
his main argument seems to be that
only the faculty can make an ob-
jective decision in regard to the
fraternity situation. Perhaps an en-
tirely objective decision is not what
is needed here to restore the balance
which once existed. This balance
is what made W&L one of the finest
small colleges in the country—not
only as a place of learning from
books but as a university where
other important aspects of life may
be learned as well.

As to Mr. Walker's apparent dis-
illusionment at what he finds here
at W&L, I certainly hope he has
made the right objective in flying
the coop. In his search for a “saner,
more mature world,” I wish him all
good luck. I feel he is doing the
right thing indeed.

Very sincerely,

CHARLES F. MORGAN

Student Blasts Conformity

Dear Sir:

It seems to me that the sense of
values of the students at Wash-
ington and Lee are grossly out of
proportion. I say this on the basis
of the class elections of last Mon-
day night and the aftermath of
heated controversy.

On Monday night a certain fresh-
man did something in the nominat-
ing convention which he sincerely
felt would benefit his class, and
through it the entire University.
This action was widely denounced as
being “detrimental to party solidar-
ity,” and for it this individual has
since been the subject of severe
criticism from his friends as well as
various other individuals.

Political parties serve a purpose
(although at Washington and Lee it
is rather vague), but when their
well-being becomes more important
than that of the body of people

they seek to serve, they have de-

In my opinion this is not inherent
in the fraternity system itself, but |
it has resulted at Washington and |
Lee through the students failing to|
honor a fraternity member’s opin- |
ion as his own. There are two pos-
sible solutions: (1) the student body
must realize that some individuals
will not surrender their complete
identity to the fraternity and will on
occasion speak their convictions; c1
(2) the fraternities must all set up
censoring committees so that no
such heresy as was evidenced on
Monday night will happen in the
future.

Math Course a Joke

One student took exception with
the mathematics department. “The
math course for freshmen is a joke.
Who needs a lot of what they teach,
especially at a liberal arts institu-
tion? Wouldn't college
course make much more
a liberal arts major?”

one student: “When tradilions such
as conventional dress are imposed by
fines, they cease to be traditions and
become merely prep school rules. No
one at the University of Virginia
goes to class without a coat and tie,
either. There is one big difference,
though—the University of Virginia
never heard of an assimilation com-
mittee. I believe this shows a basic
weakness in the Washington and Lee
system.”

As been mentioned
the above comments were made by
freshmen with above 2.0 averages.
Some took part in campus publica-

and other organizations within the
school. It is alarming and disheart-

| Private George Irwin, former
W&L professor writes, about this
action:

“One of the most terrifying things
we have to put up with is the Ger-
man aviators. One chased two of our
ambulances down a road the other
day shooting his machine gun at
them, but did not register a hit.”

Sergeant Forest Fletcher, W&L
track coach after the war, describes
one unpleasant spot, the village of
Serches, the unit went through in
late August.

The town was in a hollow and the
Germans kept dropping in gas
shells. Masks had to be worn all
the time, which made driving diffi-
cult, especially at night.

Following the Allied advance, the
unit pushed into Belgium in October.

The armistice was soon signed, but

Interview With Albee

(Continued from page 2)

As to the influence of his School
of dramatists on other media, Albee
was doubtful. He said the spirit of
the Absurd as it is now is essential-
ly and perhaps inevitably theatrical,
and he expressed the belief that
there was no indication of any sort
of profound influence of the Absurd
Theatre on movies or television.

Although he was most polite and
receptive to his interviewers, Mr.
Albee showed the greatest enthus-
iasm when he and Mr. Taylor from
time to time got off into discussions
of technical questions which were
beyond the scope of those of us who
were not intimately acquainted with
the Absurd Theatre.
