Mary in 1786. Secrecy was abandoned many lears
ago and since 1846 the society has been strictly an
honorary scholastic fraternity. Membership in Phi Beta
Kappa has long been one of the highest academic

distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is to recog-
nize and encourage scholarship and cultural in-
terests. Qualifications for membership are high
scholarship, liberal culture, and good character.

Since its founding fifty-one years ago, Gamma of
Virginia has conferred membership on students with

outstanding academic records.

Originating with ten people, one of whom was Dr.
Robert W. Dickey, professor of physics at Washington
and Lee, the University’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter has
over 600 living members. In recent years juniors who

have exceptionally distinguished records, not below
the requirement for summa cum laude (2.75) have
been selected for membership.

Election of academic seniors is based upon
seven semesters of work. Law School candidates
are selected on the basis of their law grades
but previous academic records are also consider-

EC Keeps Publications Board Representative
Leon Bibb Signed For Friday Concert Of Springs

Springs W. eekend ‘To Feature
Folk Music Festival

BY ANDY NEA

Managing Editor
Leon Bibb, one of the Nation’s leading ballad singers, will
appear at the Friday night concert of Spring Dances. Bibb will
perform with another group that will be announced at a later

date.

Bibb’s appearance is part of the Folk Music Festival that

has been planned for Spring D

ances this year. Instead of the

usual dance and concert, two concerts will be held this year.

Bibb has been described as one*
of the top interpreters of folksongs
in the country. In addition, he brings
to the stage a magnificent voice.

Leon Bibb is now in his early
thirties, and was born in Louisville,
Ky. He attended Louisville Munici-
pal College for two years where he
was a featured soloist in the glee
club.

Following a tour in the army, he
went to New York and began his
musical eareer. During this time, he
was cast in the Rogers and Ham-
merstein-Irving Berlin production
of “Annie Get Your Gun.”

Leaves Broadway

After leaving Broadway, he joined
the touring company of “Finian’s
Rainbow.” He then returned to

Broadway to appear in several mu-} y=

sicals.

Although Bibb sings a great many
folk songs, as if he had lived with
them all his life, he is not primarily
a folk singer. He has had a varied
career in the entertainment world.

He has sung in theatres, night
clubs, small informal halls, and in
big open air festivals. He uses his
well trained voice to add feeling and
expression to his preformances.

Critics Hail

Critics have hailed him as a top
interpreter of folk music. They say
that his voice is both moving and
flexible.

Bibbs appearance at W&L is part
of the continuing trend to provide
more versitile entertainment for the
student body. Dance Board Presi-
dent, Steve Galef, stated that the
Springs Weekend with the folk fes-
tival is an experiment. Many colleges
and universities of the East have had
such programs and they have proved
to be highly successful.

Two Concerts
This year, the two concerts will
be held in Doremus Gymnasium
from 8 to 10 p.m. in the evening.
The Dance Board plans to arrange
the gym in such a manner as to
provide better atmosphere. A plat-
form will be extended out into the
audience so that the singers may
have more freedom of movement.
Special Lighting
Special lighting effects have been
planned. This will add to the theme
of the Folk Music Festival.

 

 

Bibb has signed a contract to re-
cord on Columbia-Masterworks rec-
ords. This company has some of the
finest entertainers in the world.

Bibb has recently appeared in a
straight acting role in “Flight into
Egypt.” He has also played in “Liv-
ing the Life,” a musical version of
Huckelberry Finn.

He has appeared on many tele-
vision shows including the NBC
spectacular “Bloomer Girl,” ABC’s
“Music for a Summer Night,” and
most recently on the Ed Sullivan
Show.

“He is the possessor of one of
the most beautiful voices and he
devotes it to songs that mean a great
deal to him.”

EC Discusses Constitution;
Approves Several Articles

By KEN LANE

Associate Editor
In its review of the Student Body Constitution Sunday and
Monday of this week, the EC voted down the proposed amend-
ment that the Publications Board Representative be eliminated

from the committee.

The amendment was considered in*®

the form of two alternatives:

First, that the Publications Repre-
sentative be replaced by a member
from the junior class to be chosen
in the class election.

This was voted down, 7 for and
5 against, thus failing to get the
necessary two-thirds majority.

Those in favor were Ogilvie, Paul,
McThenia, Robrecht, Bishop, Chris-
tian, and Suttle.

Those against were Galef, Rob-
erts, Page, Boiarsky, and Ireland.

The second alternative was that
the Publications Representative be
replaced by a member from the
student body-at-large, to be chos-
en in the general election.

This also received a vote of 7 for
and 5 against, thus failing to pass.

Those in favor were Ireland, Paul,
McThenia, Robrecht, Bishop, Chris-
tian, and Suttle.

 

IFC Votes Down Scien Weekend Plan

By TUESDAY WRITERS

A proposal from the IFC’s So-
cial Committee that would elimi-
nate fraternity sponsored combos
during the hours of the Friday
University dances, failed to pass
the IFC by a 7-9 vote in last
night’s regular meeting.

The proposal was drawn up by
the Social Committee in conjunc-
tion with the Dance Board.

It came as the result of a two
and one half hour session held
Monday afternoon, and the pro-
posal was an effort to bring a bet-
liaison between the University
Dance Board and the IFC.

Discussion in last night’s lengthy
meeting of the IFC revealed that
the IFC did not favor such a pro-
posal, but it was decided that the
IFC would favor such a proposal
on a yearly basis.

‘This Year Only’ Basis

In an amendment to the propos-
al made by the Social Committee,
George Honts, Delt president, sug-
gested that the proposal be chang-
ed to a “this year only” basis,
thus keeping the proposal from
becoming a permanent part of the
IFC Constitution.

Honts’ amendment passed the
IFC by a 12-6 vote, but the pro-

‘THIS YEAR ONLY" BASIS FA V'ORED

 

posal from the Social iii
when voted on, failed to pass by..
7-9 vote.

The original proposal from the
Social Committee, which was re-
jected, stated that “there shall be
no fraternity sponsored combos in
conflict with University dances on
Friday nights of dance sets.”

The aah if mene would
have only affected two dance sets

Discussion in the IFC meeting
showed that certain members of
the Council felt that to adopt such
a proposal would be to limit what
power the IFC had, and that such
a move would cause the IFC to

 

Debaters Face Carolina On TV

Over United

Washington and Lee’s champion- ,

ship debate team will take on the
University of North Carolina in a
debate March 12 before the cameras
of a North Carolina television sta-
tion.

The debaters will appear on “De-
bate Tonight” over WUNC-TYV, an
educational station operated by the
University of North Carolina. The
teams will discuss the topic “Re-

become “a rubber stamp for the
Administration.”

Galef Appears

Dance Board President Steve
Galef attended the meeting and
explained that he felt the pro-
posal was necessary since attend-
ance at the dances had been off
near the close of the dances.

Galef reported that the Social
Functions Committee of the facul-
ty had previously given up five
University sponsored dances (this
does not mean concerts or dance
sets in the past four years.)

To say that the Social Functions
Committe, Galef explained, is not
honestly making an effort to co-
operate with the fraternities would
be a mistake.

Issue Goes to Houses

It was decided that the question
would be returned to the houses
and that it would be aired again
at next week’s IFC meeting.

In other business, the IFC voted
18-0 in favor of allowing members
of the Australian Lacrosse Team to
eat in the houses when the team
visits here.

Trophy To Be Awarded

It was announced that the IFC
Help Week trophy would be
awarded at next week’s meeting.

See editorial on page 2.

 

 

Those against were Galef, Rob-
erts, Page, Boiarsky, and Ogilvie.

The Committee voted through
an amendment that the minimum
of 50 signatures be raised to 150
in the petition for candidacy for a
major student body office.

The only two dissenting voters
were Ogilvie and Christian.

A further amendment, unanimous-
ly accepted, was that the 150 sig-
natures specifically be those of
Washington and Lee students.

An amendment was also unani-
mously passed that the petition
for candidacy be presented “the
second Monday after spring re-
cess,” rather than, as formerly
worded, “some suitable date in
in April.”

An added stipulation in the policy
of elections was inserted providing
that “if no simple majority of the
voters is obtained by a candidate
there shall be a run-off election
between the two candidates receiv-
ing the largest number of votes.”

Voted to be stricken from the
Constitution was the article “No
fraternity campus organization, or
individual with the backing of such
organizations, shall by threat or
coercion direct the vote of any in-
dividual or group of individuals”
ete.

The only dissenting voters were
Christian and Suttle.

Among the other actions of the
EC, a section added under “C” of
Article IV that “The member from
the Publications Board shall be
elected on the same day as the
General Student Body Election,”
was carried unanimously,

An amendment was proposed that
the member of the Publication Board
and the Secretary be omitted and
replaced by two representatives at
large, the Secretary to be chosen
by the incoming EC, but it was voted
down.

The proposal failed to carry by
a two-thirds majority, with a vote
of 7 for and 5 against.

Voting for the amendment were
Ireland, Paul, McThenia, Robrecht
Bishop, Christian, and Suttle.

In addition to its review of the
Constitution, the EC discussed the
Assimilation Committee and re-
solved that the best means of en-
forcing its rules is the “prompt

Fraternities Should Take More Interest In IFC’s Problems

Washington and Lee University’s In-
terfraternity Council, not unlike similar or-
ganizations found on other college cam-
puses, is generally recognized by both the
Administration and the Student Body as
being a relatively weak organization.

Recent events in the news have brought
the remote possibility of a sophomore rush
system to W&L, and these news items
clearly indicate that our IFC needs a change
in policy. This ‘‘do-nothing” organization,
to be something blunt, had better start do-
ing something or face the possibility of be-
coming a rubber stamp for the whims of
“The Hill.”

This year has seen the IFC take some
(but few) constructive steps, namely the
passing of a pledge training resolution in
December which forbids having fraternity
training sessions during the first semester
past 11 p.m. The passing of the watered-
down Help Week proposals, we are reluct-
ant to admit, could also be called a positive
move.

New and more important issues pres-
ently face the IFC. The sophomore rush
petition, which has been so much publi-
cized, stares in the face of the IFC, while
the possibility of further combo restrictions
seem to appear in the making more and
more every day.

Washington and Lee’s IFC, needless to
say, is far too weak an organization. Issues
are met by the fraternities with a basically
apathetic attitude, and this indifference is
thus reflected in a basically disinterested
IFC.

The Tuesday Edition would suggest, al-
though we fear that it may do little or no
good, that the IFC and especially each of
the 18 social fraternities examine closely the
events that surround any legislation propos-
ed or passed by the IFC.

In all the above named cases, where
IFC action did take place, whether reluct-

antly or not, the fact remains that under
no circumstances did any action take place
without prodding either from the Adminis-
tration or from the faculty. The IFC in no
cases took the initative, the group simply
sat back, did nothing, and was forced into
action for fear of intervention from the
University.

Is this attitude, we ask the fraternities
and the IFC, the correct one to hold in this

 

day of growing dislike for social fraternities?
No, we must answer, and our answer must
come in the form of a loud and ringing
negative voice.

WEL Loe At Communism

Sixth In A Series

This is the sixth in a series of nine

Perhaps the major problem surround-
ing the IFC lies in the tradition of carrying
issues back to the houses for vote before
any steps can be taken by the fraternity
group. (The IFC Constitution, we add,
does not require that the above be done, it
simply is a tradition.) Another problem fac-
ing the IFC is that its representatives are
often not the fraternity officers (much less
the presidents) but are usually inexpeti-

enced sophomores who have political de-
sires.

THE FUTURE: WHAT DOES IT HOLD?

In any evaluation of our IFC, we are

 

faced with the future. The rush petition
has brought this question to a head, for
our fraternity system, as we presently know
it, could hang in the balance if such a sys-
tem is adopted.

Our readers may ask what the areas for
reform actually are. One major area lies in
in the fact that fraternity averages are con-
stantly low. The list of fraternity standings
for the first semester, for instance, reveals
that only six of the 18 houses were above
the all-men’s average.

This past semester’s figure, we are un-
happy to report, is not the exception, but
rather the rule.

To illustrate what can happen as a re-
sult of IFC inaction, let us look at what re-
cently took place at the University of North
Carolina.

The administration of UNC requested
the IFC there to come up with a solution
to the fraternities’ constantly having bad
grades. The IFC, we have been led to be-
lieve, did nothing, and as a result the ad-
ministration passed a resolution denying
rush privileges for one year to fraternities,
if 80 per cent of their members failed to
have ‘‘C” averages. This example painfully
indicates what can, and will, happen where
inaction is the dominant characteristic of
the IFC.

We would suggest, in view of the many
problems which currently face our IFC, that
the Council take the initiative in instituting
reforms where reform is in order.

The IFC should act on its own, not due
to the prodding from the University, re-
gardless of the area where change is being
considered.

The IFC should work closely with other
groups, namely the EC and the Dance
Board, in an effort to determine where
problems lie and where reforms are needed.

FUTURE UNCERTAIN

 

Use Own ‘Evangelism’

articles by members of the Washington

ism and its various aspects.

Dr. Louis H. Hodges’ article, The

Church in Russia, analyzes the Soviet Be

Dr. Hodges points out that with
the triumph of Marxism a new dimen-

By DR. LOUIS H. HODGES
Associate Professor of Religion

The Church in Russia has en-
tered what may meaningfully be
called the “post-Constantinian
era.” Historically in the West since
Constatine heads of church and
state have ordinarily held in com-
mon on a theistic world-view. It
was within this context of unity
that struggles for power were
fixed. With the triumph of Marx-

ist philosophy and the Communist
Party in the Soviet state there has
come the destruction of that basic
unity. A new dimension has thus
been added to the traditional con-
flict between crown and church:
church and state are based upon
incompatible world-views.

The Bolshiviks very early
sought to destroy the churches by
heavy-handed techniques such as
locking church doors, confiscating

Track-O-Gram Ends With
Or In Standard English-- ‘Hi! Lemons Get Stronger’

By THORNS CRAVEN
Tuesday Columnist

As you all know the people in the gym and
I have a loving and lasting relationship which
has most recently culminated
in my being placed on their
mailing list.

If you are like me, you
probably didn’t know they
even had one—but you
=. should. And I highly recom-
mend your trying for a po-
sition on this highly regard-
ed roll, for I predict it will
become a status symbol of
the first order.

Now the literature which
they are sending out is not
conventional, and it even has a special desig-
nation—the TRACK-O-GRAM. This, I have
found out, means that the letter is somewhere
between dirty post cards and singing tele-
grams. And they’re much more fun than either,
providing you’re reading someone else’s, and
not getting your own.

The TRACK-O-GRAM is too priceless to
just describe, so I'll give you some particularly
juicy extractions, and then give you a few
thoughts I’ve had. Please remember that I’m
not making any of this up, that they’re for real,
and that obscene literature should be reported
to your postmaster.

TRACK-O-GRAM No. 1 starts out like this:

“This is number one of a series of ‘poop sheets’
to keep the W&L track team informed. Please

 

Craven

keep them in a handy file so that you can refer
to them. Important dates, times, places, and
people will be discussed.

“Good, thought I, somebody is initiating a
let’s bring jocks up-to-date on what’s hap-
pening in the world program.” (A sort of In-
siders Newsletter for straps.) But no, on this
same page was the plea: “Bodies especially
needed for the hurdles, etc.” (“Forget the poli-
tics, Craven,” I said, “this is serious, someone
has decided that bodies are needed.” This leads
me to wonder how the events have been per-
formed in the past. A bodiless track team
sounds sort of silly.’)

But I let that pass for we all know that some
pretty silly things have been done in the past.
Then I read in great big letters: “Bring some
extra bodies with you!!!” (Now this is serious,
because it involves me, and I’m damned if I
want anybody bringing my body with him to
some crazy meeting.)

TRACK-0-GRAM No. 2 is a little more
newsy, but there isn’t much discussion of im-
portant places or people, at least not unless
you think Wilson Field is an important place.
But, let’s on to the particulars. Under “C” of
item one the letter says: “Come dressed ‘a la
jock strap.” Now who who ever thought jock
strap was French? And even if you did, did
you ever put one a “a la?” And who wants
to go to a meeting dressed like that anyway?
Especially with the weather what it is. Again in
item one there was a plea for bodies.

Item No. 2 is classic: “Excluding Sundays
and Meetdays (Which day is that? I thought

‘Citrus, Altius, Fortius,’

that there were only seven.) we want your
body (Well, you can’t have it) for only one
hour (Not even for that long.) For every min-
ute on the field beyond one hour, we will
charge you a loafing time—25 cents.” (Good
luck, I’ll stay on the field as long as I want. It’s
my field just as much as it is yours.)

Here are the advantages of all this; “we
will... (1) make you stronger and faster (HA),
(2) make you feel better (sleep better and a
higher EUPHORIA INDEX) (Good luck on
that, and besides my euphoria index is fine,
thank you, and I already sleep pretty good,
just ask my professors.) (3) Makes you look
better.” (Don’t bite off more than you can
chew is all I can say to that).

Item No. 3 is “The Plan” which reads like
directions to a new board game like Monopoly.
(Sample: “Fill 49 spaces on the...”)

I’m trying not to belabor this thing any
more than it’s worth, so I'll move on to the
ending of TRACK-O-GRAM No. 2. It says: “If
you can’t cut the mustard, turn in your gear.”
(This was the first time I realized there would
be food, and hell, anybody can cut mustard,
even without a knife.)

But the living end is the last three words,
and you won't believe it. It’s Latin! Unfortun-
ately, it’s written in longhand, so I can only
guess at the words, I think it says, “CITRUS,
ALTIUS, FORTIUS” which means “Hi! Lem-
ons, get stronger!” It could also mean “strong
lemons get high.”

Figure it out.

ecclesiastical wealth, and disfran-
chising clergy. Hitler demonstrat-
ed in 1943—by reopening many of
the churches—that the support of
the churches was both valuable
and available. Stalin, catching on,
made concessions to the churches
in a bid for their support in the
war effort. As a consequence,
many of the establishments re-
vived by Hitler remain active to-
day.
Present Soviet Policy

Being fully aware of the fun-
damental incompatibility between
Communist philosophy and Chris-
tian theology, the present Soviet
government is fighting Christianity
in several ways.

The first line of attack is the
positive one of instruction of the
young in Marxist philosophy and
method. Soviet “evangelism” for
Marxism has certainly equalled in
fevor that of historic Christianity.
Indeed, the Communists have
learned much from church his-
tory—cathechetical instruction, the
Inquisition, and perhaps the
“witch-hunts” of New England.

A second tactic, in fact the re-
verse side of the first, is an at-
tack upon Christian faith as “su-
perstition.” A reintensification of
anti-religious efforts is evident,
for example, in the establishment
in 1960 of a new Soviet monthly,
Science and Religion. This publi-
cation seeks by both ridicule and
serious debate to unveil the “su-
perstition” of Christianity and to
demonstrate the deleterious ef-
fect of Christianity—particularly
Christ’s forgiveness—upon “good
Soviet morals.”

The third effort against religion
is to ignore the churches by es-
tablishing state institutions to ful-
fill the roles heretofore performed
by the churches—e.g., civil rituals
to supplant the traditional rites of
baptism and confirmation. This
policy betrays Soviet recognition
that harsh suppression of the in-
stitution often results in new vi-
tality for it underground.

Against, Not For Russian Church

Strength of Church

The total effect of Soviet pol-
icy on the Church is difficult to
assess. That the Church is still
quite alive is implicit in the very
existence of the state’s attack.

Even if reliable statistics were
available—as they are not—they
would mean very little for an es-
timate of the relative strength of
Christianity in Russia. We know
that approximately 50 million Rus-
sians, about one-fourth of the
population, are members of the
Russian Orthodox Church.

A number of protestant groups
have gained a foothold in Russia.
Among them are Baptist, Seventh
Day Adventist, Lutheran, and
Evangelical and Reform churches.
The size and strength of these is
not known, though one estimate of
Baptist membership is 520,000.

Strangely enough, Protestants
have enjoyed considerably more
freedom under the Communists
than under the Czars. Protestant
groups were placed at quite a dis-
advantage by the established state
church (Russian Orthodox) before
1917. Under the Communist state,
which is avowedly atheistic, Prot-
estants are at least on equal foot-
ing with other Christians.

There is evidence of continued
theological sophistication behind
the iron curtain. Some examples:
Russian theologians contribute
learned papers to the quarterly
Communio Viatorum published in
satellite Czechoslovakia; Orthodox
representatives entered knowingly
into debates of the recent assembly
of the World Council of Churches
in New Delhi; observers report
that local clerics effectively preach
traditional Christian faith inside
Russia.

A final gauge of the relative
strength of the Church is the fact
that increasingly the younger gen-
erations participate actively in
church affairs, though no one un-
der 18 can become a member.

Roger “Bip” Fauber, the 6’ 2”
General forward from Lynchburg,
was elected captain for next sea-
son at a meeting of the team late
last week.

Top Rebounder
Fauber again this year led the
team in rebounds with an 18.1 aver-
age per game. Sophomore guard
Tom Supak was the top scorer for
the Generals with a 15.1 average.

Fauber was second on the squad
tossing 14.6 points on the average
and Louis Paterno ended up third
with a 116 average.

Percentages

Captain Fauber was the top Gen-
eral in the percentage department
also. He had a 46 per cent seasonal
average in field goals and was 79
per cent from the foul line.

Eighth in Nation

Currently Fauber ranks eighth in
the nation’s smaller college players
in rebounds, but is liable to drop
a couple of notches when total sea-
son records have been compiled.

12 RETURNING LETTERMEN

 

Weather Bad, Prospects Bright
For Veteran W&L Baseballers

It’s baseball season once again
at Washington and Lee. If you don’t
believe it, just ask the weatherman.

This is the third year in a row that
the Generals have had their spring
practice hampered by bad weather.
The snow is expected to curtail their
outdoor activity for some time, be-
cause even after it melts, time must
be allowed for the field to dry out, to
avoid its being torn up by the play-
ers’ spikes.

This year’s team will be out to
better last year’s 8-4 record, the
first winning season the team had
in some time. To pull this trick
coach Joe Lyles has 12 lettermen,
several unlettered veterans, and a
crop of freshmen who, according
to him, “look pretty good.”

Lyles can put a letterman at
every one of the eight regular spots
on the diamond. Behind the plate
he’s got senior Jim Russ. In fact, he
has seniors to fill all of the vital
area “up the middle,” with Park
Gilmore to play second base, team
captain Ned Hobbs at shortstop, and
Robin Wood in center field.

the infield Lyles has Chuck Lane,
last year’s second leading hitter, to
play third base, and either sopho-
more Howard Martin or senior Mike
Monier to play first. Monier won his
letter in his sophomore year, but
was forced to sit last year out, and
Martin took over the position.

To go with Wood in the outfield,
there are senior Bobby Williams,
last year’s leading hitter, in left,
and junior Buck Rose, who closed
out last season with a spectacular
diving catch, in right.

The pitching staff is the question
mark this year. Last year’s eight
wins were accounted for in large
part by the graduated Roy Car-
penter, who won five. The other
three wins went to righthanders
Phil Sharp and Penn Way, and

lefthanded Brice Gamber.

sophomores. All three are letter-
men,

Behind the lettermen, Lyles has
Sandy Smith, a junior outfielder
with two years’ experience on the
bench; Jack Cover, junior outfielder-
first baseman who’s back after a
year’s layoff; and senior Jim Gwinn,
a pitcher, back after two years of
inactivity.

From the freshman class, Lyles
must find another catcher, a left-
handed pitcher, and some reserve
infielders.

He may have the southpaw he
needs in Chris Wigert, like soph-
omore Way a native of New Jersey.

Skip Essex and Fox Urquhart are

Coach Lord mentioned Andy Kil-
patrick in the distance events, and
Paul Ajermark and Jeff Conrad in
the pole vault as promising fresh-
men.

Chris Kell and Bill Jamison are
trying out for the sprints. Dave
Killebrew is running the 440 and
Ken Boiarsky will compete in the
weight events.

The team should be strong in
the sprints, high jump, broad
jump, hop-step and jump, and
middle and long distance runs
but Coach Lord warns that they
will lack some in depthe.

About 50 men came out for the
first practice, but Coach Lord would
like to see that number doubled be-
fore the start of the season, espec-
ially more men in the field events.

Fraternities Should Take More Interest In IFC

With a sincere effort, the IFC can gain
the status of being a powerful and worth-
while organization.

If inaction continues to be the rule,
however, we can only predict disaster for

the IFC, and in the long run, for each of

the social fraternities.

 

Russians See Value Of Church

(Continued from page 2)

Despite outward signs, however,
the Church wields little power in
Soviet society since no member of
the Party can be a member of the
Church. The Church is not in a
position to influence public policy,
this making Christian action very
difficult.

After about 45 years of Soviet
efforts to remove Christianity from
the Russian scene the Church re-
mains alive. The problems asso-
ciated with eradicating approxi-
mately a thousand years of Chris-
tian influence in Russia are be-
coming increasingly apparent.

Where the state will turn in
the future no one can predict with
accuracy. Some think that the
present policy may be abandoned
or perhaps pursued simultaneously
with attempts to use the Church
as the Czars did so effectively. The
radical philosophical difference be-
tween the Party and the Czars,
however, is likely to prevent a
return to the former close alliance
of Church and State.

Another possibility is all-out
persecution of the Church. In past
centuries Christianity has most of-
ten gained strength (but lost mem-
bers) when under persecution.
This means that the Soviets must
devise a workable method of per-
secution if they follow this line
of attack. Whether they can re-
mains to be seen.

A more likely path, in my
opinion, is a continuation of pol-
icy in effect since the Revolution,
ie., intermittent attack within a

Also discussed was the question
of whether the EC would conduct

take action on the matter.

general policy of trying to by-pass
the Church through state func-
tions—all this in hopes that the
church will wither away. This has
at least the prestige of Lenin be-
hind it.

Whatever state policy may be,
the future can present only more,
not fewer, problems. As the in-
dustrial revolution bears more and
and more fruit in Russia, the
Christians of Russia face the task
of relating Christianity meaning-
fully to human life under complex,
urban-industrial conditions. The
Church will stand or fall on the
basis of the creativity it can mus-
ter in dealing with that new world.

Lenin’s word was that the state
should not bother itself with
Christianity since it “will be
thrown on the rubbish heap by
the mere force of economic de-
velopment.” The unanswerable
question of the future of chris-
tianity in Russia, therefore, is
whether a church not allowed to
speak directly on public issues can
avoid this end.

Other freshmen who have im-
pressed the coach in the team’s
somewhat limited activity so far
have been outfielder Bob Taylor,
first baseman Braxton Tabb, and
catcher Ashley Allen.

Righthanders dominate the veter-
an team, which opens on the road
against Elon College. The only left-
handed batter among the lettermen
is centerfielder Wood, and there are
two southpaw pitchers.

But Lyles expects the veterans to
run better and make fewer mental
mistakes due to their experience.

The team opens the season March
31 at Elon, as usual. On their south-
ern swing they’ll play, among others,
Newberry, South Carolina, Wilming-
ton, East Carolina College, and Nor-
folk College.

The home opener is set for Friday
April 18, against Lynchburg College.

The 18-game schedule is full of
opponents from the Little Eight,

SHAKESPEARE DOESN’T LIVE HERE
ANY MORE
A recent and most heartening development in American college
life has been the emergence of the artist-in-residence. In fact,
the artist-in-residence has become as familiar a sight on campus
as Latin ponies, leather elbow patches, Rorschach tests, hula
hoops, and Marlboro cigarettes.

And we all know how familiar that is—I mean Marlboro ciga-
rettes. And why should it not be familiar? Why, where learning
is king, where taste is sovereign, where brain power rules
supreme, should not Marlboro be everyone’s favorite? The same
good sense that gets you through an exam in Restoration Poetry
or solid-state physics certainly does not desert you when you
come to pick a cigarette. You look for a flavor that is flavorful,
a filter pure and white, a choice of pack or box, a lot to like. You
look, in short, for Marlboro—and happily you don’t have to look
far. Marlboro is available at your friendly tobacconist’s or vend-
ing machine, wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty states and
Las Vegas.

But I digress. We were speaking of the new campus phenome-
non—the artist-in-residence—a man or woman who writes,
paints, or composes right on your very own campus and who is
also available for occasional consultations with superior students.

Take, for example, William Cullen Sigafoos, artist-in-residence
at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identifi-
cation.

As we all know, Mr. Sigafoos has been working for many years
on an epic poem in rhymed couplets about the opening of the
Youngstown-Akron highway. Until, however, he went into
residence at the Toledo College of Belles Lettres and Finger-
print Identification, his progress was not what you would call
rapid. He started well enough with the immortal couplet we all
know: They speed along on wheels of rubber, rushing home in
time for subber .

Then Mr. Sigafoos got stuck. It is not that his muse deserted
him; it is that he became involved in a series of time-consuming
episodes—a prefrontal lobotomy for Irwin, his faithful sled
dog; fourteen consecutive months of jury duty on a very com-
plicated case of overtime parking; getting his coattail caught in
the door of a jet bound for Brisbane, Australia; stuff like that.

He was engaged in a very arduous job in Sandusky — posing
for a sculptor of hydrants—when an offer came from the Toledo
College of Belles Lettres and Fingerprint Identification to take
up residence there, finish his magnum opus and, from time to
time, see a few gifted students.

Mr. Sigafoos accepted with pleasure and in three short years
completed the second couplet of his Youngstown-Akron Turnpike
epic: The highway is made of solid concrete and at the toll station you
get a receipt. y3

Vas
rae". aah)

"Wat 6 trath Pr’ <ztd ne

Then a few gifted students came to visit him.

They were a
prepossessing lot—the boys with corduroy jackets and long,
shaggy beards; the girls also with corduroy jackets but with
beards neatly braided.

“What is truth?” said one. “What is beauty?” said another,

“Should a writer live first and write later or should he write
and do a little living in his spare time?” said another.

“How do you find happiness—and having found it, how do
you get rid of it?” said another.

“Whither are we drifting?” said another.

I don’t know whither you are drifting,” said Mr, Sigafoos,
‘but as for me, I am drifting back to Sandusky to pose for the
hydrant sculptor.”

And back he went, alas, leaving only a fragment of his Youngs-
town-Akron Turnpike epic to rank with other such uncom-
pleted masterpieces as Schubert’ s Unfinished Symphony, the
Venus de Milo, and Singer’s Midgets.

& + x
Take cheer, good friends, from one masterpiece that is com-
plete. We, refer, of course, to Marlboro cigarettes. Filter
end and tobacco end are both as good as tobacco artistry
and science can make them.
