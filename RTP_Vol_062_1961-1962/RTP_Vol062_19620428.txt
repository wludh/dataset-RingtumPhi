‘Prince Valiant’ Creator
Shows Cartooning Secrets

By HARRY MEEM
SIPA Edition Managing Editor

Research and people are the sec-
rets behind “Prince Valiant.”

Hal Foster, who draws the na-
tionally syndicated comic strip for
King Features, made these points
yesterday in an address to SIPA del-
egates at Washington and Lee.

When he first started the strip, “I
had a beautiful story line all ready.
I got Val and his parents on a boat—
and there they stood, naked, for the
next three months. I had no idea
what sort of clothes they wore, what
kind of armor, what kind of boat
even. So I had to look it all up.”

Foster has spent a good deal of
time since he started the strip
traveling to the countries which he
uses as settings for Valiant’s adven-
tures. He finds this necessary for
the sake of accuracy; to check the
terrain, what the buildings look like,
the shapes of the trees, and back-
ground in general.

The accuracy is a necessity, for
every little mistake which he makes
brings letters from “experts” in the
field concerned.

 

_The travels serve another purpose,

for the people he meets on the way
often reappear in the cartoon.
Another problem Foster faces in
drawing “Prince Valiant” is that of
local regulations prohibiting show-
ing certain things in pictures. He
once drew a picture of a nightmare
which his hero had, showing all
sorts of weird creatures from the
underworld, including a snake. Un-
fortunately, one state has a regula-
tion prohibiting drawing snakes. So
the syndicate had to make a substi-
tution—four snake eggs.

There are also social taboos he
must observe in drawing his hero.
For instance, he can show Valiant
standing in the middle of a fight,
with his famous “Singing Sword”
dripping crimson, but he can’t show
the prince actually striking a man.
Likewise, Val can’t be shown actual-
ly taking a drink of wine, even
though he may be shown sitting
with a full cup in his hand.

Foster also gave a quick history
of cartoons, from paintings on cave
walls in southern France through
Chinese picture writing to the use of
comics to increase newspaper circu-
lation.

Wide Range Of

Radio Washington and Lee marks
its second full year of broadcasting
this year.

Broadcast Monday through Friday
nights from W&L’s Journalism De-
partment studios in conjunction
with radio station WREL, the five
different programs which fill a time
spot from 8:05 to 9:00 p.m. offer
a wide range of entertainment for
Washington and Lee and Rockbridge
County listeners.

Nick Denton, a junior from Chevy
Chase, Md., is Program Coordinator
for Radio Washington and Lee. Den-
ton also produces the Wednesday
night show, “Emphasis Abroad.”

Classical Music

Monday night is devoted to clas-
sical music and opera. “Pro Musica,”
produced by Pete Lynn, a senior
from Lynchburg, Va., has also of-
fered its listeners a program of
music by Robert Stewart, Assistant
Professor of Fine Arts at Wash-
ington and Lee, played by the Roa-
noke Symphony Orchestra.

Steve Guild, a junior from Okla-
homa City, Okla., produces the Tues-

day night show, “Concert.” Guild
plays semi-classical music, sounds
of a less serious nature than those
played on Monday night’s show.

The Wednesday night show, “Em-
phasis Abroad,” is a neweomer to
the Radio Washington and Lee sche-
dule this year. Denton and his as-
sistant producers, Phil Bacon and
Bill Gray offer music from other
countries, including Mexico, France,
and Russia. In addition, each pro-
gram includes some of the history
and literature of the country.

Thursday night’s show, “Kaleido-
scope,” is the ancestor of Radio
Washington and Lee. First intro-
duced in 1956 by SIPA Executive
Director John Jennings, then a
W&L student, the program is pres-
ently produced by Andy Adelson, a
junior from Baltimore, Md. Adelson
presents a wide range of shows, from
strictly documentary types to radio
plays and comic takeoffs,

Friday night’s program is con-
cerned with “The Sound of Jazz,”
produced by senior Thorns Craven.

Reston

The struggle to “adjust to the
problem of change” and President
Kennedy’s “new generation” world
leadership were discussed Friday in
a speech by James Reston to the
33rd annual SIPA convention.

Reston, the chief of the Wash-
ington Bureau of the New York
Times, spoke to some 1,100 delegates
attending the annual convention at
Washington and Lee University.

Controversy over the Truman-
Acheson era and the Eisenhower-
Dulles era have come and gone, Res-
ton said, but the problems remain
the same. Sweeping changes—in-
volving increased automation, in-
creasing population, and attendant
political problems—have created new
and complex headaches for
leaders.

Since World War II, one billion,
two hundred million people have
changed their form of government
and 800 million have achieved inde-
pendence for the first time, he said.
This has created another primary
difficulty for conduct of world af-
fairs.

“Old societies which provided such
order as there was before the war...

world |

 

have taken a secondary position.

The decisive power has passed
from Europe to the United States and
the Soviet Union—“The two least
experienced in conduct of foreign
affairs,” Reston said.

Mobility within the United States
is another factor adding to the com-
plexity of political decision-making,
acecording to Reston.

The United States has “a totally
fluid society the like of which we
have never seen in this country be-
fore.” He mentioned the movement
of people to the West, the shift of
Northern technicians to the

some

South, and the shift of Negroes from
the South to the North. Leaders,
therefore, have new situations to
adjust to constantly, according to
Reston.

The New York Times Bureau chief |
also cited the world population in- |
“perhaps the most dang- |

creases as
erous outbreak in world history.”
Automation and its effect on
overall scope of political affairs was
also mentioned as an adjustment
problem.

campaigns and recognition of edu-

the excellence of its writing and re-

Winners of the other three state
scholastic awards were The Hickory
Twig, Hickory High School, Hickory,
N. C.; Hi Times, Honea Path High
School, Honea Path, S. C., and Mul-
lens Hi-Lights, Mullens High School,
Mullens, W. Va.

The Hickory Twig was given the
12th annual North Carolina Scholas-
tic Press Award “for its effective
role in school and community af-
fairs; for the completeness of its
coverage; for its high journalistic
standards; and for its lively spirit.”

The North Carolina Scholastic
Award was sponsored by the Wins-

‘Spectator’ Wins Virginia Prize

By ROBERT HOLLAND
SIPA Edition Editor
The Spectator of Granby High School, Norfolk, Va. today
was named winner of the 14th annual Scholastic Press Award
of the Virginia Press Association.
The citation, presented at the SIPA convention luncheon

in Doremus Gymnasium, praised The Spectator “for its varied
and complete coverage of all phases*

 

written and photographic coverage;
for its recognition of school and re-
lated problems; for its innovations
and pleasing presentation.”

Hi-Times was given the David A.
Tillinghast Memorial Award of the
Greenville News-Piedmont Company
for the South Carolina Scholastic
Press—the third annual award given
in South Carolina. Hi-Times was
praised “for its well-balanced ob-
jectives in relation to students, facul-
ty, parents and community; for its
appropriate recognition of individual
and group achievements; for its con-
cise, factual reporting and effective
use of good pictures.”

Sixteen other publications and a
radio program have received SIPA
trophy awards.

These trophy winners were select-
ed as top publications from a field of
305 publications entered. Seven
newspapers, seven yearbooks, two
magazines, and a radio station won
the first place awards.

See page three for a complete list
of trophy winners.

 

James B. Reston, the chief of the
Washington Bureau of the New York
Times and speaker at a noon session
Friday of SIPA, wound up as the
“President of Inland Steel” on one
of the SIPA current events quiz-
zes given Friday after Reston’s
speech.

Byron White, the newest member
of the United States Supreme Court,
also was described as a Briton “who
is a member of the Ban the Bomb”
on one of the quizzes.

The current events quiz, given an-
nually at SIPA conventions was won
this year by Hugh Moore of Mc-
Callie School, Chattanooga, Tenn.
Moore received a score of 88—one
of the highest in the history of the
quiz.

Newspaperman Reston and Su-
preme Court Associate Justice White
were not the only “displaced per-
sons” found in the stack of quizzes.
The quiz produced its usual amount
of unusual answers.

 

 

 

 

‘Displaced Persons’ Show Up
On SIPA Current Events Quiz

Great Polo Player

For instance, Bernis Owens, the
PFC whose criticism of President
Kennedy’s call-up of the reservists
almost earned him a court martial,
was variously described as “a great
polo player who just fell off his horse
to a “U.S. playwright who has
a play off Broadway.”

Joseph Francis Rummel, the New
Orleans Archbishop who recently
excommunicated three segregation-
ists, was described on the quiz as
a “Catholic Archbishop who survived
persecution during World War II.”

Rummel was also called a German
pianist who is becoming very popu-
lar in the United States.

The director of the Housing Ad-
ministration, Robert Weaver, was
labeled the “head of the John Birch
Society; a radical organization,” and
“a Senator who attacked a civil
rights bill.”

chev—were born in the nineteenth
century in contrast to Kennedy.

After the Cuban fiasco, the Soviet
Union began to put pressure on the
|new United States Administration to
see how it would commit itself. For
example, this pressure has been ex-
erted in Berlin, on the nuclear test-
ing question, and on disarmament, he
said.

This pressure “has settled down
the Administration in a way, per-
haps, that success would not have
settled it down.”

The many factors involved in
| world problems creates a problem
jfor reporters as well as_ political
| leaders, he said.

 

Too often, he said, reporters report
lonly single incidents and not the
’ ‘broad picture.” Reporters are like-
| ly to be reporting “the unusual and
| the violent and emphasizing the
| unusual and the violent.”

“T think this | is a false picture of
| where we are,” Reston said. “If we
take a broad view, we need not be

| too pessimistic.”
| Both extraordinary accomplish- |
|ment and disappointment can be
| found, he said, but if one compares

ship after World War II with the
record of British and French leader-
ship after World War I, the picture
is rosier.

In a question and period following
his speech, Reston said that Kennedy
was the “first President in modern
times who is using all the instru-
ments at his command and cen-
tralizing them.” He is surrounded
by advisers and cabinet members
who have technical knowledge, but
who are not dominant personalities.

Reston predicted that as the trend
toward an urban society continues,
the trend toward centralization of
government will continue.

In response to another question,
he said of the Peace Corps—‘“as a
symbol I think it’s a very good
thing,” adding that it demonstrates
to the world’s people that the “mis-
sionary zeal of United States” citi-
zens has not completely vanished.

Referring to the recent steel price
controversy, Reston said that he
thought the President would exert

| his influence to hold down wage de-

|

mands of labor unions, but he added
that he does not have the legal power
against labor that he had against

| the record of United States leader-! business.

Truth And Freedom

“He serves best who serves the truth.”

The above is the motto of an organization dedicated to
combatting secrecy wherever it exists and promoting freedom
of the press throughout the world. The organization is Sigma
Delta Chi, a professional journalistic society which was founded
in 1909. The Washington and Lee Chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi plays an important role in SIPA conventions.

Sigma Delta Chi is the oldest, largest, and most select or-
ganization in the field of journalism. It is the only organization
that embraces all kinds of journalism as well as all ranks of
journalists. It is dedicated to the highest ideals of professional
journalism and is comparable to professional organizations
serving the fields of medicine and law.

The purposes of Sigma Delta Chi may briefly be defined
as: (1.) promotion of the highest standards of newspaper prin-
ciples and ethics, and (2.) promotion of our most valuable
freedom, freedom of the press. SDX chapters work toward the
first objective throughout the country by annually giving
Distinguished Service Awards in Journalism in fifteen cate-
gories of journalism. These awards are offered in the hope that
they will stimulate outstanding journalistic accomplishment.

In our opinion SDX’s work toward the second objective—

 

that of freedom of the press and freedom of information—is ,

even more important than the first. Since 1946, Sigma Delta
Chi has maintained a standing national committee which takes
an active, aggressive leadership in the cause of freedom. Sigma
Delta Chi statutes, providing for open meetings by public
agencies and for open access to public records, have been put
into effect in many states. Other extensive work has been, and
is being accomplished by this group.

We believe that Sigma Delta Chi’s work should be supple-
mented by the efforts of all citizens, whether they are associated
with the press or not. If truth is to triumph over falsehood, the
objectives of Sigma Delta Chi must be maintained.

SIPA—1962

The press and its historic role in shaping the destiny of this
country is a fascinating and valuable study for anyone to under-
take—whether he be a journalist, prospective journalist, or
interested citizen. The saga of the press and its continuing
fight for the public’s “right to know” indeed closely parallels
the growth of the United States as a great nation among the
world powers. Freedom of the press and our other many
cherished freedoms are, in fact, inseparable.

It is for this reason that greeting so many high school
students vitally interested in the press is such a gratifying ex-
perience. The Southern Interscholastic Press Association, and
similar press meetings, provide a unique opportunity for inter-
ested students to enrich their understanding of journalistic
processes.

The more than 1,100 secondary school students attending |

the 33rd annual SIPA have, in our opinion, been attending
a highly worthwhile gathering. Throughout the years the SIPA
convention has contributed immensely to standards of year-
books, magazines, and newspapers of secondary schools in the
South. SIPA has been growing, both in numbers and influence,
since it was begun at W&L 33 years ago.

Students and advisers who through the years have traveled
to Lexington have made the largest single contribution to the
manifest success of SIPA. The convention’s value is a personal
matter—what a student takes away from the two-day affair
depends on how fully he takes advantage of the opportunities
before him. Judging from the delegates’ attendance and re-
sponse this year to the lectures, panel discussions, class sessions
and short courses, clinics, and informal get-togethers it would
seem that opportunity has not been wasted.

In every sense, this seems to have been a productive session.
James “Scottie” Reston of the New York Times and Hal

Foster provided valuable insights into their respective speciali- |

ties. Other professionals were also quite informative and enter-
taining. The Washington and Lee University Department of
Journalism and Communications, the W&L chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi, professional journalistic society, the members of
the W&L Laboratory press, and the Administration of Wash-
ington and Lee—all have played important roles in making
SIPA a success again this year.

Ultimately, however, the people who attend SIPA as del-
egates determine its success or failure. And we thank you sin-
cerely for making the 1962 convention a big success. As you
return to your respective homes and schools, we hope you will
not forget the hours spent here. We hope some spark of in-
spiration has been kindled and will remain kindled within you
and that you will want to seek more information about journal-
ism.

Journalism is a broad term that encompasses a wide range
of activity—from newspapers to magazines to radio and tele-
vision. Making an all-inclusive list of everything that falls under
the term of journalism would be an onerous task. But one
salient generalization can be safely made about the field; it is
a vitally important one and one that is becoming more import-
ant each day. The complexity of the world we live in makes it
imperative that events be explained accurately and put in
the proper perspective. This is the large role journalists have to
fulfill.

The most fascinating thing about journalism is that no one
can ever learn everything about it. But there are precious re-
wards to be garnered in striving for the unattainable.

Home Edition, a nightly 15 min-
ute newscast from the Washington

| combination of classroom laboratory
land extra-curricular activity. Inter-
national, national, sports, state and
local news are covered in the student
broadcasts.

Since Home Edition is on the air
| five nights a week, it is the primary
| source for local news for area citi-
| zens. Often it beats the two county
| weekly newspapers by several days

carried by radio station WREL.
| Local news is covered by mem-

sity. Other Home Edition news ar-
| rives via Associated Press teletype.
Regular beats covered by the stu-

In addition to its regular news-

broadcasts a weekly editorial each
Friday night, and special editorials
when the need arises. An editorial
board consisting of Kelly and the
five seniors meets each Wednesday
to plan editorial campaigns.

This year, the editors began a
new policy—one which has proved
to be quite successful, they believe.
After an editorial is presented on
WREL, a copy is sent to the two
local weekly newspapers. The editors
of these newspapers have printed
several Home Edition editorials of
local interest in the past few months.

Once again this year, Jennings
held this important post—a position
which is a real year-round opera-
tion since the planning for an SIPA
convention must start as soon as the
previous year’s activity is finished.

As Jennings can testify, the job
is often a tedious one. He made the
first contacts with this year’s dele-
gates last November when 2,500

postcards were mailed to secondary
schools. The big mailing, however,
came in January when registration
forms, bulletins, and announcements
for the State Scholastic Press As-
sociation Awards were sent out.

Meanwhile, the Advisory Commit-
tee was corresponding and exchang-
ing ideas. Several secretaries handled
the voluminous mail which flowed
into the journalism department.

When the entry forms and pub-
lications arrived, they were classi-
fied and judged, and certificates were
prepared for the winners.

As time for the 33rd annual con-
vention rolled around, Jennings was
a familiar figure slouched over his
desk, working to “beat the dead-
line.”

This marked the third year Jen-
nings has served as the Executive
Director. He also helped with the
convention when he was a student
at Washington and Lee.

What benefit can SIPA delegates
derive from their experience at the
convention?

“The delegates can profit the most
from a free exchange of advice
among themselves,’ Jennings said.
“This convention is a good place to
work out problems, because most
problems that arise in school pub-
lications aren’t unique to any one
school.”

During World War II, he served

SDX Amendment Opens

Executive Council Sessions

The Sigma Delta Chi chapter of
Washington and Lee has successfully
sponsored an amendment to the

W&L student body constitution re-|

quiring that Executive Committee
meetings be open to the press and
public.

The proposal won overwhelming
support in the student elections held
the day before SIPA delegates began
to arrive for their convention.

Co-sponsoring the amendment
was the Tuesday Edition of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Working toward greater freedom

of the press is one of the expressed |

aims of national Sigma Delta Chi

 

and the W&L chapter.

‘es for the journalism

|for printing the Ring-tum Phi but)
i most of W&L’s other campus publi-
cations, posters, and pamphlets.

The first person concerned with

copy, as we follow an issue of the
| W&L newspaper through the print)
| shop, is the Linotype operator, Lyn-

wood Pullen. Often Pullen must
| double in his duties and act as
proof reader and copy editor.

Next, the type goes to Edward
| Backus, the print shop’s chief com-
| positor. Backus formerly ran _his
|own print shop in Buena Vista and
' annually teaches a newspaper short
course to SIPA delegates.

Edwin Walker is probably the most
versatile man in the shop. In addi-
tion to assisting Backus, he operates
the shop’s two smaller presses, casts
plates for pictures and newspaper
advertisements, and operates the
machine which folds newspapers as
they come off the press.

The completed forms, ready for
for printing, go to pressman Don
| Tabbut, who came to Lexington from
the Virginia Gazette in Williamsburg.

Mr. Lauck’s work is not confined
to his print shop. He conducts class-
foundation,

national Graphic Arts Education As-
sociation and several years ago he

| was awarded a Distinguished Serv-

vice Citation at the annual SIPA
awards banquet “in recognition of
