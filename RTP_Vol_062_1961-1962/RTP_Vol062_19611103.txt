ELLINGTON SIGNED FOR FANCY DRESS

 

Board Petitioned by EC

To Reverse Ban on King

On Tuesday, student body President Andrew McThena,

acting as spokesman for the Executive Committee, forwarded

a letter to members of the Boa
reconsider their decision on Dr

rd of Trustees to urge them to
. Martin Luther King.

The Board was recently requested to permit an invitation
to Dr. King to speak under the auspices of the University

 

SI Lead Story
Lauds W&L
Football Team

Washington and Lee’s un-
defeated football team is made
up of students who like to
play football rather than foot-
ball players who study, Sports
Illustrated associated editor
Walter Bingham says in the
national magazine’s lead story
this week.

Bingham, who visited W&L last
weekend, prior to the Emory and
Henry Parents’ Weekend game,
calls Washington and Lee “the most
successful of all schools in Ameri-

ca that have de-emphasized their
athletic programs.”
History

Bingham traced the history of
W&L from the ’Gator Bowl team
of 1950 to the present undefeated
squad, telling in detail the reasons
for subsidization being dropped by
the university.

“The football players, on the
whole, were proving scholastically
inferior” during the subsidized years,
says Bingham, but the university
might not have dropped its scholar-
ship program if “a large portion of
the football team had not been
caught cheating during the final
exams of 1954.”

Lean Years

Included in the ten-year history
are anecdotes from what Bingham
calls the “lean years” at W&L, when
victories were few and far between,
and spectators numbered in the
teens.

The miserable results of the lean
years caused many alumni and stu-
dents to favor a return to subsidiza-

 

McCrum’s Drug Store, which ordi-
narily piles up a whopping sale of
“10 or 12 copies of Sports Illustrated
a week,” ordered 550 copies of the
national sporting magazine _ this
week.

By yesterday afternoon, 475 copies
had been scooped up—the biggest
magazine boom in Lexington history.

 

tion, but the University and the
Board of Trustees held their posi-
tion of no financial support for ath-
letes.

“There were like a bunch of little
kids who had their red wagon taken
away,” Bingham quotes one present
member of the General squad as
saying in a reference to the alumni.

Chipley

When the University fired Head
Coach Bill Chipley in 1956, after
W&L won only one game, it looked
as if the powers-that-be might be
contemplating at least a partial re-
turn to emphasis on athletics, says
Bingham, but the University con-
tended that it had released Chipley
because he was not “a good teacher
of football.

In 1957, Lee McLaughlin took over
the reins of the General football
coaching staff—a position he still
occupies.

Frustration

Bingham analyzes the problems
faced by McLaughlin in recruiting,
when he has nothing to offer the
boys “except a good education.”

“Recruiting here is like selling in-
surance,” McLaughlin told Bingham.
“You see a thousand boys, maybe
you get ten.”

McLaughlin’s efforts, his first two
terms as General head coach were

KChristian Association. The request
was forwarded to the Board mem-
bers with a recommendation for
approval by the faculty committee.
The Board denied the request.

The Executive Committee’s letter
gives an account of the student
body’s strong opinion against the re-
fusal to permit the invitation.

The EC continues by saying, “Al-
though concerned with the immedi-
ate problem of refusing to allow the
Rev. King to be invited to speak, we
feel that the issues presented here
have a broader implication. Such re-
strictions upon academic freedom is
both damaging to the general repu-
tation of the University and more
definitely to the morale of the stu-
dents in attendance.”

The letter quotes from the Wash-
ington and Lee Catalogue which says
the University will apply the “dem-
ocratic form, the accepted American
form, of social organization.” The
statement adds that W&L is dedi-
cated “to the liberty of the mind
with its attendant right of inquiry.”

Finally the letter states that the
spirit and freedom of the expression
of ideas should not be limited and
restricted, “that an airing of contro-
versial questions and opinions is
necessary to further the search for
truth.”

A petition, sponsored by Protest,
has also been circulated on campus.
The purpose has been to call to the
attention of the Board of Trustees
the feeling of antagonism that has
arisen from their decision among
the students. The appeal is for a re-
consideration by the members of the
Board, and a reversal of their origi-
nal decision.

The Student Bar Association, rep-
resenting the Law School students,
has indicted the Board of Trustees
for “such infamous rulings.”

Parents’ Council Discussion

The activities of last weekend did
not prevent the matter of Dr. King
from being discussed. The Parents’
Advisory Council was advised of
the existing situation.

After considerable discussion it
was concluded that in as much as
permission to extend the invitation
to Dr. King was sought from the
Trustees by joint faculty-student
committee, no question of academic
freedom was involved. The sugges-
tion was made that the procedure
used to gain permission from the
Board was unusual but under the
circumstances the decision was made
with authority and without breach
of the right of inquiry.

 

Billy Butterfield Signed
For Hollins Cotllion Dec. 2

Billy Butterfield, the McCoy
Brothers orchestra, and the Four
Voices will be the musical highlights
of this year’s Hollins Cotillion, De-
cember 1-2.

Two formal dances, a concert, open
house in the dormitories, a buffet
supper and Sunday brunch are the
major events of the weekend.

Butterfield will play at a dance
from 8 to 12 Saturday night in the
Hotel Roanoke ballroom.

For the McCoy Brothers, it will be
a return engagement as they play-
ed for the Saturday night dance at
last year’s Cotillion weekend.

“The enthusiasm for their per-
formance was so great that we decid-
ed to contract them again,” said
Peggy Williams, Cotillion Club pres-
ident. “Everybody seemed to like
them better than Buddy Morrow,”
she said.

The four Voices will sing at a
2 p.m. concert on Saturday, backed
by Butterfield and his band. Open
house in the dorms will be held after
the concert, followed by a_ buffet
supper in the Hollins dining room.

 

(Continued on page four)

Sunday morning brunch is from
11:30 to 1:30.

 

Quiz Bowl Team To Appear
On Roanoke TV Sunday

The W&L College Bowl team
will appear on “College on Camera”
Sunday, at 1:00 p.m. on WDBJ-TV,
channel 7, Roanoke. The program
was taped last Tuesday evening. Mrs.
John Aldridge, wife of a Hollins
professor, conducted the interview.

Mr. Frank Parsons, the team
coach, described the selection of the
team and the preparations for the
College Bowl program. The four reg-
lar and two alternate members of
the team were interviewed and asked
questions similar to those asked on
the College Bow! program.

The team will continue practicing
with the use of the buzzer to in-
crease each member’s efficiency and
alertness. The skill of most import-
ance to the team at the moment is
to feel the pace of the show and then
to work up to it. The members have
been listening to tapes of the College
Bowl program in order to get the
pace. This also familiarizes the team

 

with the voice of Allen Luden, the
moderator.

Although strong in most categor-
ies commonly covered in quiz bowl
questions, the W&L team is weak in
science because there are no science
majors on the team. Another weak-
ness may develop because none of
the members are familiar with pro-
grams on television.

The team is being coached in its
knowledge of modern concepts in
the field of art by Dr. Marion Jun-
kin. The team’s strong points are in
literature, philosophy, history, myth-
ology, music, and current events.

When asked about Pomona, the
possible W&L opponent, Mr. Parsons
said, “They are highly qualified and
a good group of men.” The match
this Sunday between Amherst and
Pomona will determine which col-
lege the W&L team will face. Mr.
Parsons feels that our team is strong
no matter who the opponent.

 

Four Students Get Lee Grants
For Psychological Research

During the 1961-1962 school year,
four Washington and Lee students
will be actively engaged in carry-
ing out certain psychological re-
search projects. The experiments
are being supported through grants
from the Robert E. Lee Research
Fund.

John Harcourt is doing research
in the problems of verbal learning.
He will test experimentally some of
the variables that determine the
amount and rate of learning. Har-
court is working under the guid-
ance of Dr. Leonard Jarrard. Mem-
bers of the student body will be
used as “guinea pigs” in the exper-
iment, which will involve the pres-
entation of certain “nonsense sylla-
bles” to the student and the test-
ing of his powers of rentention un-
der varying conditions.

Wally Thulin will continue re-
search on the behavioral effects of
ionizing radiations on white mice.
The purpose of this research is to
determine the minimum amount of
radiation that will result in changes

 

 

IFC To Give
Beer For Blood

Students who didn’t give blood
because of hour quizzes this week
will get another chance—for charity
this time—when the Red Cross
Bloodmobile comes here Monday for
the Interfraternity Council Blood
Drive. The fraternity with the great-
est number of donors gets a keg of
beer for its efforts.

Donor cards were distributed in
the fraternities this week. They are
also available in the Co-op.

The Bloodmobile will be at the
Student Union from 10 am. to
4 p.m. Monday, according to IFC
Blood Drive chairman Pete Alford.

 

Fall Collegian To Appear
Nov. 18: Civil War Issue

The Southern Collegian Openings
issue’s delayed release this year was
due to an unavoidable delay in the
printing of some full-color adver-
tisements. Although the magazine
has now been completed, its release
is being delayed until November 18,
the date of a home football game.

These ads were printed in Chicago
and mailed to Lexington too late for
the Collegian to be released on time.

The theme for the issue is the
Southern Collegian’s celebration of
the Civil War Centennial. The truth
behind such great encounters as
Pickett’s Charge, Fort Sumter, and
the battle between the Monitor and
the Merrimac is revealed for the
first time.

Editor Roger Paine says the Col-
legian “will, of course, include all
the usual tripe.”

Copies of the issue were removed
from the print shop and are under
lock-and-key until the release date.

 

in performance in an operant con-
ditioning situation.

If performance in this situation
does not prove to be sensitive to
radiation exposure, then this proce-
dure can be used to determine the
effectiveness of various chemical
agents in decreasing damage caused
by such radiations. The practical
results of the experiment could be
in developing a form of protection
for human beings in the event of
nuclear war.

Don Stubbs is doing experimen-
tation to determine the effects of
drive in learning. Several hypothe-
ses developed by psychologists Hull
and Spence will be tested.

The role of motivation in learn-
ing is being studied by Mark White-
head. Motivation factors will be con-
trolled by the use of stimulant and
depressant drugs on white rats.

One experiment will be to have
subjects acquire a habit such as
bar pressing for food. After the
rats have learned this task, one
group will be injected with a stimu-
lant, a second with a depressant,
and the third will serve as a con-
trol group. Different theories pre-
dict different reactions under these
conditions. By gathering experimen-
tal data, Whitehead hopes to test
these theories and contribute to the
formulation of a more accurate one.

 

Four Freshmen Debaters
Compete at Wake Forest
In Six Speaking Events

Four freshmen’ debaters left
Thursday morning to compete in
six debates, Thursday and Friday,
at Wake Forest College in Winston-
Salem, N. C., with novices from col-
leges throughout the South.

Professor William W. Chaffin, de-
bate coach, accompanied Steve
Smith, Malcolm Morris, Gay Read-
ing and Tim Vandiver.

Smith and Morris will debate the
negative side and Reading and Van-
diver the positive side of the year’s
topic, “Resolved, that labor unions
should come under the jurisdiction
of anti-trust legislation.”

Vandiver and Readings debated
as a team in the recent four-college
tournament at W&L, scoring a vic-
tory over the University of Rich-
mond.

 

Tickets For VMI-Citadel
Game Are Placed On Sale

Washington and Lee students
will have to shell out four dollars
for a ticket to the VMI-Citadel
game tomorrow afternoon on Wil-
ser field, UNLESS they pick up
a ticket before 12 noon Saturday
at VMI.

Then it'll cost only two dollars
for the game, which may decide
the Southern Conference cham-
pionship.

The game will be broadcast on
WREL.

 

Cheaper Costumes, New Location

For Ball, Head List Of Plans

The Dance Board announced today that Duke Ellington
and his Orchestra will appear here for the 1961 Fancy Dress

Ball on February 2.

Steve Galef, Dance Board president, said that he was sure
that Ellington, and the many innovations in Fancy Dress,
should make this “the most exciting one in the past few years.”

 

Boy Meets Girl,
First Troub Play
Closes Tonight

Boy Meets Girl, the Troub-

adour Theater’s first produc-
tion of the season, goes on
stage at 8:30 tonight for its
final performance.

The play, a comedy about two
Hollywood writers who delight in
playing practical jokes on their
producer, features a special three-
minute film clip shot on location
last week.

Starring in the film is five-month-
old Billy Roberts, who makes his
acting debut as Happy, an unchal-
lenged infant prodigy and_ the
youngest star in movie history.

Happy endangers the stardom of
Larry Toms, the cowboy idol of
the matinee, who should have stayed
on the range. Bruce Whelihan plays
Larry Toms.

Andy Leonard and Gerry Gray,
juniors, play the roles of the two
zany script writers. Their producer,
whom they constantly harrass, is
played by sophomore Phil Booth.

Susie Dunnell portrays Happy’s
mother, a pretty young girl of less-
than-rigid moral convictions.

Dr. Cecil D. Jones, Jr., assistant
professor of fine arts, is directing the
play.

Boy Meets Girl opened Tuesday
evening.

Other major roles include soph-
omore Steve Colvin of Evansville,
Ill, as a young Englishman who can-
not act but still manages to get into
trouble at every turn; senior Ron
Alenstein as a stereo-typed greedy
actor’s agent; and Scott Iacone and
Jim Applebaum as a pair of hack
composers of background music for
films.

In other roles, Yvonne Dickens
plays the  producer’s — secretary;
Wanda Johnson, a _ nurse; Lisa
Tracy, a manicurist; Tom Hampton,
adoctor.

 

Five Students to Represent
W&L at U.N. Conference

Washington and Lee will be rep-
resented by five students at a stu-
dent conference at the United Na-
tions in New York.

Steve Galef, Dave Knight, Bob
Ketchum, Lewis Westefield and John
Paul will attend the American As-
sociation for the United Nations
student conference, “1961: U.N. Year
of Crisis.” The W&L men will attend
panel sessions within the conference
on such topics as the problems of
Chinese representation, African de-
velopment and the U.N., and the role
of the non-aligned nations in inter-
national politics.

The conference lasts from noon
Friday to Saturday afternoon, Nov.
10-11. The highlight of the confer-
ence will be a speech Saturday by
Prime Minister Nehru of India.

 

Ford Times Features
Article by Fishwick

An article about the hill folk of
Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee
by Dr. Marshall W. Fishwick, chair-
man of the department of American
studies here will appear in this
month’s issue of Ford Times.

The stories refers to the super-
stitutions and life of the people and
the terrain of “Conjur Country.”

Dr. Fishwick, the author of sev-
eral books and numerous articles on
southern life, has been a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
since 1949. He is a native of Roanoke.

Ford Times is published monthly
by Ford Motor Company and is dis-
tributed nationally through its deal-
ers.

The Dance Board and Fancy
Dress president Bill Ide and his vice-
presidents are already at work plan-
ning the weekend. The Dance Board
is awaiting administration decision
to see if the Ball will be held in
Evans Dining Hall.

As the Dance Board announced
this summer, the costumes will be
available at a lower price than in
the past few years. Frank Young,
Dance Board vice-president, is work-
ing out final arrangements with
Oak Hall Costume Company in Roa-
noke. The costumes and theme will
be announced later this month.

Satch Gets Better Offer

Galef explained that Ellington was
booked only after the possibility
of hiring Lous Armstrong and his
Orchestra was ruled out. Armstrong,
who originally planned to appear
at W&L, accepted a four week en-
gagement in San Francisco which
paid considerably more money. As
a result, he will not be available on
the East Coast until February 9,
1962.

“The hiring of the Ellington Or-
chestra will mean that the Dance
Board has more money to spend
on the concert and dance the sec-
ond night of the Fancy Dress
weekend,” said Galef.

The Dance Board also released the
results of the preference poll taken
in the registration line this fall.
Ray Charles was the overwhelming
choice of students. The Dance Board
said that it would do everything
possible to get Charles here. They
have found, however, that booking
agents have sharply increased the
price for Ray Charles and his Or-
chestra during the past year. Galef
said the increased price “presents a
problem.”

Ellington a Veteran

Ellington and his orchestra are
among the best-known in the enter-
tainment field. He has been active
in music for more than 30 years. In
addition to conducting and arrang-
ing the music for his orchestra,,
Ellington is also an accomplished
songwriter.

Washington and Lee students re-
cently had the opportunity to hear
some of Ellington’s songs in the
movie “Paris Blues,” for which he
did the entire score. He has done
the scores for many other movies,
including the prize-winning “Anat-
omy of a Murder.”

Ellington has appeared at the top
jazz festivals in the country and has
toured around the world several
times. He records for Columbia
Records. His LP album, “Ellington at
Newport,” is one of Columbia’s most
consistent best sellers.

 

Dr. Phillips Will Attend

Economic Convention
In Memphis Nov. 10-11

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., assist-
ant professor of economics here will
attend the annual meeting of the
Southern Economics Association No-
vember 10 and 11 in Memphis, Tenn.

During the sessions of the asso-
ciation, Dr. Phillips will discuss “The
Technological Revolution and Prob-
lems of Regulation,” a paper to be
presented by Prof. James M. Hund
of Emory University, Atlanta.

Dr. Phillips, who joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1959, will be the only representative
of the university’s School of Com-
merce and Administration present
for the meeting.

A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Dr.
Phillips received his Ph.D. degree
in 1960 from Harvard University. He
is the author of articles in several
economic and business journals. He
is currently writing on regulatory
problems.

The Southern Economics Associa-
tion includes economies and business
professors in most southern colleges
and universities.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

‘Breeding Dead Lilacs’

In last Friday’s editorial column we made some rather
strong criticisms of Washington and Lee and her administra-
tion. We have had exactly two comments on that editorial—
one from a freshman who asked us if it was true, and a short
defense from a member of the administration who pointed out
that a curriculum study group was meeting now.

The editorial was deliberately one-sided, but we still stand
behind it as a perfectly fair treatment of the situation here. But
the response—and we hardly expected any of the faculty to
write a letter to the editor—has been nil. We think this only
proves that Washington and Lee has an even more fundamental
fault: the University doesn’t care about ideas.

Just yesterday we had a professor tell us in class of a
knowledgeable friend who levelled the same charge at W&L.

Is it true? We are afraid so.

Our professors do a generally fine job of presenting the
facts in their respective subject fields, but they slight the under-
lying controversies, the varying ideas which are the class’s very
raison d’etre.

Facts we know, but how often is there any real argument
about ideas in class, or outside of it? It certainly is not ungentle-
manly to disagree on the interpretation of history or the criti-
cism of literature. And what good are the facts if no one cares
to discuss their meaning, and no one tries to make sense of
them?

Why don’t we have time to come to grips with the big
questions of our day in class? It is our belief that no one can
understand his era unless he makes a sincere effort to make
up his own mind on most important issues of that era. For
those issues represent the tensions and conflicts which will be
used by later historians in describing the history we are living
now.

It is not the place of the Ring-tum Phi to point out specific
instances to prove this point. Any reasonably alert and inter-
ested student or professor should be able to name several ex-
amples right off the bat.

But we are reminded of two remarks that Dr. Nels F. S.
Ferre made last year during the University Religious Confer-
ence. He said:

 

1. “I guess lingusitic analysis is big here.”’
2. “I’m sure you’re in the midst of an argument over Teil-

hard de Chardin.”

No, Dr. Ferre, we’re afraid we didn’t even know what you
were referring to.

The Ring-tum Phi plans to take a larger responsibility in
presenting and discussing some of the important questions with
which we should concern ourselves as students. We have neither
knowledge nor judgment to do much of a job, we fear. But
we're sick and tired of having men like Dr. Beach came down
here and talk about things we haven’t even heard of. We’re

also ashamed.

A Sign Of The Times

“A campus conservative club hasn’t arrived today until it
has its own magazine,”’ says an editorial in this week’s Nation-
al Review. Among the publications lauded is “The Individual-
ist,” published by The Intercollegiate Society of Individualists.

A society for individualists? O lost!

A Pleasant Reminder

We were glad to hear yesterday that Mr. Brady, the Super-
intendent of Buildings and Grounds, will have the bells in
Washington Hall rung if the football team beats Centre tomor-
row.

Ringing the bells after football victories “away from home”’
is an old Washington and Lee tradition. It has always seemed
to be a fine gesture to ring them—reminding people who stay
here in Lexington that the team has chalked up a victory in
hostile territory. And it should be a worthwhile reminder to
the team that there are many people in Lexington waiting to
see how they have upheld W&L’s honor, even though there
be little evidence of support wherever they are playing.

We'll be all ears tomorrow afternoon.

Juggernaut: Panic From ‘Left’? |

(Editors’ Note—This week we initiate a new
series of articles which will review books and
magazine articles of interest to Ring-tum Phi
readers.

Steve Smith, the new assistant news editor
of the Friday edition, reviews a special edition of
The Nation published this week.

Smith is a Sigma Nu freshman from Jackson-
ville, Florida. He was editor of the student news-
paper at duPont High School there, and has
written for the Jacksonville Journal.)

By STEVE SMITH

A combination of Militarism and Big Business is
dominating the United States today, says Fred J.
Cook in his article “JUGGERNAUT: The Warfare
State,” presented in the Oct. 28 issue of The Nation
magazine.

“The military juggernaut, hand-in-glove with in-
dustry, is high-balling along the highway...to...
authoritarian government...” says Cook; he speak
of power “that has come to dominate the nation and
rob the nation’s people both of understanding and
of choice in the fashioning of their destiny.”

Take a “starved and neglected Army,” merge it
with hungry Business and: enter “the military indus-
trial complex;” “War-minded Military and war-orient-
ed Big Business;” all of which produces “the kind of
Prussianized military-industrial concept that produced
Hitler.” Or so says Mr. Cook in his Liberal answer
to “Operation Abolition.”

It is Cook’s view that the years of working together

; during World War II gave the military and business

a link which they have never broken. He feels that
this combination is making the major policy decisions
in America today, regardless of Welfare, caring only
for the Warfare in which they profit. These two powers
are rendered formidable and odious by the “large-scale
fraternization of the Military with the radical Right.”

Cook’s warning of the power of the military-
industrial complex is well-founded; his article
contains a great deal of documentary evidence.

But, as sometimes occurs in the writing of a zealot,
there is a bit of disdain for the conflicting cases and
its interpretation of the details.

For instance, Cook classes the forces that are most
eager for war in the U.S. as “the same forces that
must abhor the Welfare State.” His statement clearly
disreregards the fact that ther are many conservatives
who want neither war nor Federal Welfare status; just
as “Operation Abolition” disregards liberals by calling
everyone who protested against the HUAC in San
Francisco a communist dupe.

A Slap at David Lawrence

The article describes David Lawrence as “represen-
tative of a type of mind that braves the prospect of
world holocaust with a gay insouciance,” certainly a
rank injustice to a respected conservative columnist.
But to Cook it matters only that Lawrence opposed
social legislation from Washington.

Sarcastically Cook spikes all American foreign poli-
cy which has demonstrated any force of firmness—
ringing Russia with air bases, remilitarizing West Ger-
many, holding Quemoy and Matsu, or speaking for
“the jungle fiefs of a primitive people like the Lao-

tians.” He is unbelievably, opposed to these stands in
favor of “the negotiatory spirit.”

Sabotage at Geneva?

Cook goes on to attack U.S. disarmament policy.
Far from criticizing the Reds, he states that America’s
militaristic forces have “resorted to distortions and de-
ceit, even to outright lies in their determination to
sabotage any possibility of agreement at Geneva.”

They were able to do this through the coopera-
tion of “the Military, the Atomic Energy Com-
mission, and the mass media information—a
trinity that never had desired an end to the arms
race.”

The article closes wtih a vitriolic bath of denuncia-
tion for the Right. Cook says that “when we hear...
a Goldwater sound the siren trumpet... they mean the
total incineration of the world.” He swings at “the
House Un-American Activities Committee, the John
Birch Society, fundamentalists churches, reservists,
chambers of commerce, PTA’s, trade unions, busi-
ness groups, and service clubs” for the showing of
“Operation Abolition.” Then, having tied all these at-
tacks in with his Militaristic Domination theme, and
having run out of vulnerable whipping-boys, he con-
cludes on the same note.

“A Frightening Case”

In spite of his intolerance of certain facts and
of members of the opposition, and his refusal to
admit that anyone with views contrary to his
own could reach a desirable goal, Cook presents a
frightening case.

He begins by pointing out that President Eisenhow-
er in his farewell address warned that the power of
“the military-industrial complex” is now being felt
“in every city, every state house, every office of the
Federal Government.”

He cites the Army-Air Force battle for public con-
gressional approval of conflicting and overlapping mis-
sile programs, in which each of the branches bought
the “devotion of Madison Avenue’s best brains” to
propagandize the nation. Present lobbying and adver-
tising by the military to influence public opinion is
added.

The article explains the degree of dependence on
military spending of many major industries and of
large areas of this country, and the way in which these
interests continually fight for increased military effort.

Perhaps the most convincing argument is that
of Douglas MacArthur. “Our government has
kept us in a perpetual state of fear—kept us in a
continuous stampede of patriotic fervor—with the
cry of grave national emergency. Always there
has been some terrible evil at home or some
monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble
us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by
furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded. Yet,
in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have
happened, seem never to have been quite real.”

The “missile gap,” draft calls, and army strength in-
creases are given as examples of this type of pulling
the wool over the public’s eyes. This portion of the
article is almost enough to make the reader forget
certain other parts of it.

 

Age-Old Gripes: Police, Medical Office

 

By ROSEWELL PAGE

We hear that the university has
changed and even progressed a
little in the past forty years. The
admission standards have gone up.
The “quality” of the student is
alleged to have risen considerably.
The physical improvements are per-
haps more obvious.

Well there are some things that
haven’t changed and among them
are the things that students most
often gripe about. In reading a pub-
lication which appeared on our cam-
pus some four decades ago, I came
across the following two articles.
Perhaps they will sound familiar to
the editors and readers of today’s
R-tP.

Article 1—headline: New Police
Bells Prove Great Success

“The Lexington Police have es-
tablished a system of eight bells
running from East Dorm up Main
Street to notify them of danger or
distress so that they can report to
the desk seargent, take a good drink
to bolster up their natural courage,
and with all the reinforcements they
can muster, march to the scene of
the trouble. Arrived there, of course
after everything is over, they are to
scatter all students with great club

 

waving, lest any of them should
shoot a blank cartridge and scare
Miss Annie. This done, they are to
spit vehemently on the ground and
utter oaths worthy of an army of-
ficer against all criminals daring to
set foot in this Rockbridge Garden
of Eden.

“Of course, the office of the desk
sergeant moves from place to place.
In the daytime it is either in front
of the Rockbridge Bank or Irwin’s
inn and in the wee hours of the
night it is in the Greek restaurant
in the downtown section of the city.

“We note with great pleasure that
the police have so bettered condi-
tions in the Greek restaurant that
only plates and catsup bottles are
used as weapons in the fights there
now.

“We hope that the police depart-
ment will soon station a man in
each section of the dormitory to help
on the organization of crap and pok-
er games, to enforce the freshman
rules, and to bootleg for the Satur-
day night carousals....” and so the
article runs.

Dr. Smith
Discusses

U.S. Morals

By TRACY HARRINGTON

America—her morals and her so-
called leftist tendencies—are very
much under fire at the present
time.

For a number of years, various
groups have compared the United
States to Greece and Rome, declar-
ing that moral laxity in these em-
pires occured preceding their fall,
and moral laxity in this country now
indicates that we are going the way
of Greece and Rome.

W&L history professor Dr. C. O.
Smith, Jr., doesn’t agree.

Changing Values

“Certainly values have been
changing in this country, and what
the critics of change (conservatives)
are saying is that we will fall as
Rome did because we have some
of the moral characteristics.”

Dr. Smith, who said that to call
change in values “bad” is in it-
self a value judgment, said that
there are “many more differences
than similarities between us and
the ancient empires.

“Rome did not have the techno-
logical development or the impact of
modern science, or the industrial
revolution as a factor in its civili-
zation, as we do in ours.”

He added that “we cannot say
these changes mean degeneration.

“Even if moral degeneration were
a primary factor in the decline of
the Roman empire, there are too
many differences between our so-
ciety and that of the former to say
that what happens to them will
necessarily happen to us.”

He observed that what probably
changed Rome was “more economic
and political ills than moral ills.”
As examples, he cited the scarcity of
gold in Rome and the crushing of
the middle class by burdensome
taxation.

“Organic Theory”

One of the theories abandoned
by most historians, yet widely pre-
valent among many modern day
Americans, is what Dr. Smith called
“the organic theory.” This is the
belief that civilizations follow a
cycle—youth, middle age, old age
and death.

Dr. Smith said that the analogy
“is a poor one.”

He said that too many variables
were involved to compare a social
order to an organism. As an ex-
ception to the organic theory, he
mentioned the Chinese civilization,
which has continued for several
thousands years with periods of
weakness and subsequent reju-
venation, yet never “dying.”

About moral changes themselves,
Dr. Smith said they were bound
to come.

Values change under the influence
of technological and industrial in-
novations. Look at the effect of the
automobile on our values. Or, for
that matter, look how movies and
even urbanization have changed our
moral viewpoints.”

Liberal Tendencies

Dr. Smith commented on the
much-disputed question of exces-
sive liberal tendencies in the post-
depression United States.

“T wouldn’t like to do without the
liberal innovations in our govern-
ment,” he said.

“Can you imagine a society as
complex as our without income tax
or without social security?

“Ultra-conservatives want to go
back to some sort of blissful state
where the Puritan virtues of self-
reliance and rugged individualism
were widely practiced. (See editor-
ials—ed.) Everyone will agree that
these values were important in
shaping our American tradition; and
most will agree that these values
were ‘good.’

“But today many pressures in
our midst militate against these
values, pressures which cannot
readily be eliminated. How often
must the organization man pass the
buck? How often is he promoted
for heroic exhibition of individual-
ism?”

Dr. Smith said that the radical
conservatives seem to want to “op-
erate a country with 200 million
people, the large majority of whom
are urbanized, in the same manner
as a country with 20 million persons
primarily in frontier or agricultur-
al environments.

“It just cannot be done,” he said.

(In an interview article with Major
Roxbury last week, this reporter
states that the Major presented the
alternatives for America as as atomic
war or intermingling of democracy
and communism.

This was a misinterpretation on
the reporter’s part. Major Roxbury
believes, contrarily, that commun-
ism cannot and will not succeed, be-
cause it is not a practical system.

Undefeated Generals

Meet Centre Colonels

McLaughlin’s Charges
Shoot For Number Six

Washington and Lee’s undefeated Generals get a chance
to equal a school football record of long-standing when they
meet Centre College’s ‘Prayin’ Colonels” at Danville, Ky.,

Saturday.

If the Generals win, the contest will mark the 16th con-
secutive game without a loss, equaling a 16-game streak es-

 

tablished way back

The yesteryear record string in-
cluded the nine games of the all-
victorious 1914 season, and five wins,
a forfeit, and a tie in 1915.

The Generals’ current skein dates
from the final game of the 1959
season and includes a mid-season
tie last year.

Coach Lee McLaughlin’s deep
and experienced squad is now 5-0
for the current campaign. If—and
McLaughlin allows that it is a big
“if’—they manage to get by their
four remaining opponents, they
would still have to wait until the
first game of the 1962 season to
equal the school record of 14 con-
secutive wins without a loss or tie.

That venerable mark was recorded
through the 1912 and 1913 seasons,
which with the 1914-1915 campaigns,

' mark the golden years of W&L
q football.

Centre Films

To Be Shown

The Washington and Lee athletic
department will hold special show-
ing of action films taken during
this Saturday’s game against Centre
at 7:30 p.m. next Tuesday in duPont
Auditorium.

The entire student body is in-
vited.

Coach Lee McLaughlin will pro-
vide commentary on the action, as-
sisted by other members of the
coaching staff.

Current plans include the show-
ing of all away games for the rest
of the season.

The Generals have three more
games away from Lexington, includ-
ing contests with Centre, Sewanee,
and Washington University. Only
one more home game is on tap, a
November 18 meeting with Frederick
College.

has won only once in five outings
this year. The Colonels are young,
and they cannot match Washington
and Lee’s depth.

But, McLaughlin points out, they
are opportunists, converting six
Hanover fumbles into a 26-12 vic-
tory two weeks ago.

“They'll battle you all the way,
and a win over Washington and Lee
would make a good season for them,”
* McLaughlin says. “And they’re im-
proving with every game.

Last week, the Colonels fought
Sewanee savagely through the first
half, before wilting in the second

have been to Denison, 35-6; Mary-
ville, 34-0; and Southwestern, 21-0.

Centre’s 34-man squad includes
eight lettermen and 16 freshmen.
The Colonel’s chief offensive threats
from their straight-T are halfbacks
Bob Hourigan and Harley Veal. Veal
particularly impressed W&L scout
Buck Leslie.

Good Shape

The Generals are expected to be
in good condition for the Centre
game, despite the rugged physical
pounding they took in besting strong

in 1914-1915,*

McLaughlin says the effort against

lege coach.

Frosh Fail

To Score
In Four Games

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football season is more than half
over and the Baby Generals have
yet to score a single point.

The closest the freshmen have
come to scoring was in their 12-0
loss to Woodberry Forest when they
drove to the four-yard line. Since
that defeat the Baby Generals have
lost to Ferrum Jr. College, 33-0;
Augusta Military Academy, 22-0;
and Chowan (N.C.) Jr. College, 50-0.

But freshman coach Dana Swan
thinks his crew will score Friday at
Fork Union when W&L meets the
Virginia Military League’s second
place team.

What’s wrong with the Baby Gen-
erals offense which compiled a minus
three yards total offense against
Chowan?

Swan can answer that
words: “Our line.”

The Baby Generals have a flock of
better-than-average backs headed
by Martinsville fullback Dan Man-
son and halfback Skip Chase from
Frankfort, Ky., and Bill David of
New York.

But up front it’s a different story.
What little talent the Baby Gener-
als possessed at the beginning of the
season has been either hurt or is
ineffective, three of their better line-
men were injured in the Chowan
game.

in two

“Our tackles did not give us any
protection against Chowan. They
didn’t stop a thing all day,” Swan
said. “But the tackles aren’t the
only linemen who need more work.”

I-M Bowling, Wrestling

champions played ZBT to a score-
less draw to clinch first place. The

Street needed a win to remain in
contention.

Also in League C, Lambda Chi
faced Pi Phi on October 31, and
completely overran them by the
score of 25-0. The victors scored all
of their points via the passing route.
Lambda Chi has won one contest,
while their opponents have yet to
score this season.

In a contest decided in the final
period, PiKA edged the players from
Phi Delt, 6-0, on the I-M field.
Nicky Smith scored the only points
of the game on a short run with
only minutes remaining. PiKA is the
only team in League A with an un-
blemished record.

On November 1, the Delts man-
aged to stop a last minute SPE at-
tack and preserve a 6-6 tie. The
Delts are now 2-0-1, while their
counterparts have tied one and lost
one. This afternoon the netmen
from the Beta house take on Phi
Kaps in the championship I-M ten-
nis match. In the annual double-
elimination tourney, both teams have
one setback, each from the other.

In their first meeting, Phi Kap
won easily by a score of 4-1. With
only one more defeat needed for
elimination, the Betas rallied to

 

Will Begin November 7

With the I-M football season almost over, the bowling and
wrestling programs will begin on Tuesday, November 7. The
bowling contests will be held at the Civic Bowling Alley, while
the wrestling matches will be in the gym.

In football the only league champion that has been decided

is Phi Kap in Division C. On Thursday, November 2, the

representatives from East Nelson} ong meeting.

Ron Hornburger topped Tom Ed-
wards, 6-3 6-2, to lead the men from
Red Square. Also winning in the
singles for the victors were Ray
Gordon and King Milling, while
John Roy and Tom Goodwin down-
ed their opponents, 6-4, 6-3, in the
doubles.

The lone winner for the Phi Kaps
was number three man Bud Holl-
man, who defeated Steve Parel, 6-2,
6-0.

In the championship golf match
of this year, the linksters from Phi
Delt downed the foursome from
SPE. Bob Carlson and Allen North-
cutt both shot forties for the vic-
tors, while teammates Dave Carroll
and Ken Lane also played well.

The top teams in intramural swim-
ming were Phi Psi with 100 points,
SAE with 87, Sigma Chi with 82,
Delt with 78, and KA with 68.

Island Scenes In

The 28 lively, pastel-colored paint-
ings of island scenes now being
shown in the duPont Hall gallery
are the work of Horace Day. He
is chairman of the department of
fine arts at Mary Baldwin College.

Day did the paintings while living

played this summer in the Kingston

Day toured Jamaica in his “pink
jeep with a fringe on top.” When he
found a subject, he would stop and
set up his easel. Day said that both
his jeep and his painting always
attracted a crowd of interested on-
lookers.

Conservatives
Slate Articles
In N ewspapers

A series of articles written by
members of the W&L Conservative
Society’s publicity committee is
scheduled for publication in the
Ring-tum Phi, sometime in the im-
mediate future. The articles will not
deal with the goals of the W&L
society, but will focus attention on
issues of national importance.

The first story of the series will
be in defense of the House Un-
American Activities Committee and
the film “Operation Abolition” which
was recently shown on the W&L
campus by the conservatives. The
article will not seek to defend the
local showing of the film, but will
answer some criticisms of the film
and of HUAC made on the national
level.

The articles to follow will deal
with admission of Red China to the
United Nations and the present
U.S. position in the UN, the relation-
ship of NATO and the neutral pow-
ers to Russian nuclear testing, the
Western position in Berlin and the
U.N.’s responsibility to the Congo.

Eight seniors turned in applica-
tions for Fulbright scholarships in
time to meet the November 1 dead-
line. Of these, four were for work
in England, two for Spain, and two
for Germany.

The Fulbright program was ini-
tiated by an act of Congress in 1948.
More than one thousand scholar-
ships are awarded yearly, sending
students to twenty-six countries. The
principal countries are Germany,
France, and England. Washington

and Lee has been fortunate in re-
ceiving at least one award every
year since the program was initiated.
The total number of awards re-
ceived by W&L men is approxi-
mately forty.

In determining the winners, the
following factors are considered: (1)
a definite statement of purpose, (2)
extra-curricular activities, and (3)
academic work. The winners of the
awards will be announced early next
year.

no more fruitful than those spent
by Chipley, but in 1958, a class en-
tered the University that had the
kind of boy W&L wanted. It includ-
ed the boys who make up the nu-
cleus of this year’s undefeated
team—Suttle, Fohs, and Russ, for
example.

From then on, the Generals’ tide
of fortune went on the upswing, in-
stead of being buried somewhere
between the pitiable and the pathet-
ic as during the immediate post-
subsidization years.

Today, writes Bingham, McLaugh-
lin can field a competent team—a
team that doesn’t depend on the
special talents of a few super-stars.

“McLaughlin generally uses most
of his 50-odd players, not because
he is a kind man, but because the
talent is evenly distributed.”

“This year’s General squad,” says
Bingham,” is complete proof that
winning football on an unsubsidized
basis can be as much fun to play
and as exciting to watch as football
anywhere.”

THE BELL TELEPHONE
COMPANIES SALUTE
CARL HORN

How many more people will need telephone
service in Illinois by 1970? How many more tele-
phone buildings should be built, how much more
equipment ordered? Helping to find the right
answers (because the wrong ones could be very ex-
pensive) is the job of Carl Horn, a telephone com-
pany economist who graduated from college just last
year. His studies and estimates help management

make important forecasting decisions. Decisions that
will bring advanced communications to the nation.

Carl Horn of Illinois Bell Telephone Company,
and other young men like him in Bell Telephone
Companies, help make your telephone and com-

SAT.

  

munications service the finest in the world.
