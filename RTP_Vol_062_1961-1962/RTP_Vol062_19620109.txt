IFC Offers ‘Help’ Proposals

- -s

ACTION COMES AFTER DETAILED STUDY OF OTHER PROGRAMS

The IFC adopted the first
draft of a new proposal provid-
ing for changes and revisions
in Help Week. At a meeting
last night the body accepted

the proposals offered by a sub-com-
mitttee.

The committee was formed to in-
vestigate ways to stop Hell Week
abuses and devise a plan of enforce-
ment. Before the proposals were pre-
sented, efforts were made to learn
how other schools handled the prob-
lem.

Steve Rutledge, chairman of the
committee, stated that the proposal
was “founded upon striving to bring
forth a new philosophy toward pledge
training and, in particular, ‘Help
Week’.

“Tt is a constructive attempt to bring
about a more responsible and mature
attitude in regard to this phase of
fraternity life.”

The other members of the committee
are Bill Outman, Jim Gwinn, Tom
Luthy, Rupert Johnson, and Bob
Doenges.

The first draft as accepted in last
night’s meeting is as follows:

1. A week of concentrated pledge
activities will continue to exist.

2. While carrying out these activi-
ties that bind a freshman to his

Nagy A native of
Bisse, Hungary, Nagy has become a
spokesman for the captive European
peoples since his exile from Hungary
in 1947.

Nagy was active in the Hungarian
Parliament since 1939, becoming presi-
dent of that body in 1945. In that year
he also became the country’s minis-
ter of reconstruction. He was a pris-
oner of the German Gestapo in 1944.

From 1946-47, he served as Hun-
gary’s Prime Minister from which po-
sition he was forced into exile. He now
makes his home in Herndon, Va.

Founder of the Smallholders’ Party
and the International Peasant Union,

 

Nagy has lectured at colleges through- |

out the nation.

His book, Struggle Behind the Iron
Curtain, was published in 1948. He is
also the author of numerous magazine
articles.

Nagy has also served as chairman
of the foreign relations section of the
Hungarian Committee, the exile poli-
tical organization embracing repre-
sentatives of the 1956 Revolution and
post-war democratic Hungarian per-
sonalities. The committee has as its
goal the independence of Hungary and
the restoration of freedom for its peo-
ple.

3. A “hazard” is clearly defined as
any clear and present danger of
harm to the physical or emotional
processes,

4. The highest purpose of Help
Week can be achieved through con-
structive activities for the pledges.

5. Each house must submit a plan
of its proposed pre-initiation activi-

9:00 p.m. of the Sunday night prior
to the beginning of Help Week. All
House Presidents and Pledge Train-

expressed hope that the Student Body
would provide the support to make
the plan successful.

Following the meeting, president
Doenges stated that in light of the
hazing regulations that exist and the
proposals being made, he felt it his
prerogative and duty as IFC presi-
dent to inspect each house to see that
it is abiding by the rules responsibily.

The following rules governing the
handling of pledges below have been
passed by the IFC in the past.

Athletic Conference Draws Approval
From Both Coaches And Students

By DON WALLIS
Asst. Sports Editor

Washington and Lee’s recent decis-
ion to re-affiliate itself with an ath-
letic conference is meeting with the
hopeful approval of most persons
closely connected with the General
sports program.

Coaches and players have expressed
near-unanimous support of the decis-
ion, and all seem to agree that the
formation of the new College Athlet-
ic Conference—including, with W&L,
Sewanee and Southwestern of Tennes-
see and Centre College of Kentucky—
is a big step in the right direction for
Washington and Lee athletics.

Nearly everyone feels the new con-
ference should stimulate both player
and fan interest. As one veteran ath-
lete explained: “It’s pretty hard to get
excited about every game you play,
unless there is an extra significance
attached to the victory. For instance,
some of us were definitely not ‘up’ for
the Centre football game this year. If
we knew a win would move us up in
the conference, then we’d certainly be

  

 

fired up. We would play a lot better
and get more out of it.”

A basketball player echoed the
same general sentiments: “With study-
ing and everything, a basketball season
can get to be a long grind if you
don’t have a diversion, something to
keep your interest and desire up.
Meeting conference opponents does
this. And so does taking a long road
trip on a plane. It refreshes your entire
outlook and enables the player to en-
joy the game that much more.”

Coaches were also pleased with the
formation of the league. Many felt, as
did the players, that conference com-
petition would stimulate better per-
formances. And many of the mentors
feel that the conference will enable
them to recruit finer talent. “Con-
ference competition makes it possible
for both the team and the individual
to receive greater recognition than
possible under independent status. This
quite often means a lot to an athlete,”
said one coach.

But while expressing approval and
optimism over the formation of the

 

  

 

CAC, players and coaches alike added
some reservations. Many of them felt
the conference should be expanded, as
it almost certainly will be; but they
cautioned that the expansion should be
made carefully, with thoughtful con-
sideration of the quality and integrity
of schools admitted to the league.

And several coaches and players ex-
pressed concern over the expense in-
volved, their concern understandably
magnified by reports that several Vir-
ginia colleges declined to join the con-
ference due to the high traveling ex-
pense involved and that a school in
Austin, Texas, is being considered for
membership. Neither report has been
officially confirmed, however.

But, in general, Washington and
Lee’s athletic personnel are elated with
the prospects of competing in an ath-
letic conference. If handled properly,
they feel, the conference can be a
major factor in establishing Wash-
ington and Lee’s athletic system as one
of the finest amateur programs in col-
lege sports.

“Dr. Atwood’s will

‘| make it possible for Dean Gilliam to

concentrate on the increasingly com-
plex and increasingly important matter
of admissions,” President Cole declar-
ed. “He has felt for some time that
his admissions work requires his full
attention. Following a careful study of
the matter, I have concurred in his
recommendation that the functions of
his office be divided and that he be
given opportunity for concentration
on admissions and the problems of re-
lationships between Washington and
Lee and secondary schools.”

As Dean of Students, Dr. Atwood
will be responsible administratively for
the further development of a healthy
balance among various facets of stu-
dent life at Washington and Lee, Pres-
ident Cole said.

“I am extremely pleased that Dr.
Atwood is rejoining the staff at
Washington and Lee,” Dean Gil-
liam said. “We know from his past
work here what a thoroughly com-
petent person he is. He has had
wide experience in working with
Washington and Lee students in
many and varied activities. I look
forward to close association and
close cooperation with him.”

Dr. Atwood will be assisted by Dr.
David W. Sprunt, who continues as
University Chaplain and Associate
Dean of Students.

Dr. Atwood, who is 39, is a native
of New York City and a graduate of
Princeton University where he earned
A.B., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees. He
joined the Washington and Lee facul-
ty in 1952 as an assistant professor of

sociate professor in 1959.

He left Washington and Lee in
1960 to join the General Electric

New York. Since then, he and his
wife and two young sons have made
their home in Wilton, Conn.

While at Washington and Lee, Dr.
Atwood gained a_ reputation
students as one of the
most demanding but most popular |
professors. He taught courses in ele-
mentary economics, money and bank-
ing, business cycles, and banking
problems.

As professor of economics, Dr. At-
wood will devote a portion of his time
to teaching in the University’s School
of Commerce and Administration,
President Cole said.

Dr. Atwood came to Washington
and Lee originally from Denison Uni-
versity where he was an instructor
in economics. Prior to that he was a

Dr. E. C. Atwood’s Return
Will Benefit University

The announcement made today by University President
Dr. Fred C. Cole that Dr. Edward C. Atwood will return to
Washington and Lee to serve as the new Dean of Students
comes to us as a pleasant and welcomed bit of news.

Dr. Atwood, who left W&L in 1960 to join General Elec-
tric, had formerly served the University as an associate profes-
sor of economics.

Dr. Atwood, a University press release states, will assume
his position February 1, and he will assume some of the duties
formerly the responsibility of Dean Frank J. Gilliam, Dean of
Students since 1931.

Dean Gilliam, a long and devoted friend of Washington
and Lee, will continue to serve the University, we are happy to
report, as Director of Admissions.

“Dr. Atwood’s appointment will make it possible for Dean
Gilliam to concentrate on the increasingly complex and im-
portant matter of admissions,” Dr. Cole said in the press an-
nouncement.

Dean Gilliam “‘has felt for some time,” he continues, ‘‘that
his admissions work requires his full attention. Following a care-
ful study of the matter, I have concurred in his recommeda-
tion that the functions of his office be divided and that he be
given opportunity for concentration on admissions and the
problems of relationships between Washington and Lee and
secondary schools.”’

It is the Tuesday Edition’s hope that Dr. Atwood will, as we
are sure he will, ably carry out his duties which are to be “‘re-
sponsible administratively for the further development of a
healthy balance among various facets of student life at Wash-
ington and Lee.”’ We hope, in addition, that Dr. Atwood will
enjoy the success that Dean Gilliam had as Dean of Students,
and we are confident that both Dr. Atwood and Dean Gilliam
will continue to be tremendous assets to the University. There
is no doubt in our minds as to their value as servants of Wash-
ington and Lee, for both men have distinguished themselves
with careers of which any man would be envious to covet.

Washington and Lee seems to have benefited twofold from
Dr. Atwood’s return here. First, as a qualified professor of
economics, Dr. Atwood will serve the Commerce School; sec-
ond, Dean Gilliam will be given more time to spend on the
growing job of admissions.

We are confident that Dr. Atwood will gain, if he has al-
ready not done so, the admiration and the respect of the Stu-
dent Body.

We can only hope that our new dean will (and we are sure
that he will) be ever cognizant of the importance of maintain-
ing good relations between the students, always keeping in mind
their welfare in all fields of college life, and with the University.

 

Two Events Feature Communism

Two events which will take place in the next six hours will
bring the general topic of Communism directly to the Wash-
ington and Lee community. The first event which should in-
terest the W&L Student Body is tonight’s appearance of Mr.
Feranc Nagy, a former Prime Minister of Hungary.

Mr. Nagy will speak at 8 p.m. tonight in duPont Auditoro-
ium on the subject of the “Situation In Central-Eastern Eu-
rope.” As current chairman-president of the Assembly of Cap-
tive European Nations, Mr. Nagy is well qualified to speak on
his selected topic.

The former government official left Hungary in exile in

1947. In 1946 and 1947 he served Hungary as her Prime|,

Minister. With this record of service to a country which rose
in revolt against the menace of Communism, tonight’s talk
should be both interesting and informing.

The second event which emphasizes Communism is today’s
publishing by the Tuesday Editions of the first of a ten-part
series on “Washington and Lee Looks At Communism.”

This series will be run weekly in the Tuesday Edition, and
is to be written by selected University professors.

Among topics that will be dealt with in the series are ‘“The
Russian Economy Of Today”’; ‘Russia And Her Foreign Pol-
icy;” “Communism and Propaganda”; ‘Russia’s Educational
System’’; and other such articles dealing with the major facets
of Russia’s every-day life.

It is not our intention in publishing this series to “brow-
beat” our readers about Communism, but we feel that our
goal is to present a look at Communism from a local viewpoint.
We hope that the publishing of this series will enlighten our
readers on this timely subject, and we further hope that our

Continutty And Change In Russia

 

Editor’s note: Dr. Thomas P. Hughes, Asso-
ciate Professor of History at Washington and
Lee since 1959, is, indeed, well qualified to write
on the general subject of Russian history. Join-
ing the staff of the University in 1956, Dr. Hughes
teaches a number of courses that directly deal
with Russia and her past. The Tuesday Edition
appreciates this informative article that Dr.
Hughes has submitted, and we feel sure that
it will be met by the approval of our readers.

By DR. THOMAS P. HUGHES

Associate Professor of History

To attempt a chronological survey of Russia
since the Revolution for the Washington and Lee
student would not be worthwhile. Each student

here has had the opportunity to read of this
period in authoritative texts used in our survey
courses. An hour of reading would serve as an
adequate refresher if R. R. Palmer's A History
of the Modern World were borrowed from one of
freshmen who has it as a required text.

In the raltively brief space available, I shall
comment upon a few for the opinions held by
our students about the history of Russia since
1917. I have heard these opinions expressed by
students whom I have had the privilege of
teaching in the few years I have been at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Quite frequently good students try to convince
me that the history of Russia since 1917 is a
unique phenomenon. They believe that the his-
tory of Russia since the Communists took pow-
er is unrelated to all that happened in Tsarist
Russia and without analogy to the recent history
of other nations. This opinion follows from the
assumption that the acceptance of the Commun-
ist ideology by the policy makers determines the
course of Soviet history.

This is the first in a series of ten articles by members of |
the Washington and Lee faculty dealing with Communism
and its various aspects.

Dr. Hughes’ article, Continuity and Change In Russia,
gives a clear picture that the history of Russia since the
Communists took over is not unrelated to events that hap-
pened in old Tsarist Russia.

This interpretation of history is as much a dis-
tortion as the belief that economics determine
history. Yet I have students tell me that the
reign of Peter the Great does not help them un-
derstand the reign of Khruschev or Stalin. Peter
was no communist but he tried to complete the
Volga-Don canal.

Rather than demonstrate that ideas—such
as communism—do not determine history, I
shall attempt to show that the reign of the
Comunists is but another epoch in the con-
tinuum of Russian history. As suggested above,
Lenin, Stalin, and Khruschev have continued a
long-standing Russian tradition in promoting
industrial development. During the Tsarist era
the government promoted industrial growth

primarily to strengthen the military. The wel-
fare of the great Russian population was sec-
ondary to supporting the role Russia aspired
to play as a great power. Since 1917 we have
witnessed a similar concentration of Russian
resources in heavy industry and military ap-
paratus.

Another example of the continuity of Russian
history is Russian foreign policy objectives since
1917. Students of history know that Russia has
long thrust eastward into Europe. The Nazi-Soviet
pact of 1939 brought the fourth partition of
Poland. Russia’s Balkan ambitions were consum-
mated—not originated—by Stalin. Honors papers
have been written at this University which trace
the uninterrupted penetration of Russian influ-
ence into central and far Asia.

Russia’s history has long been one of expan-
sion from the confines of the principality of Mus-
kovy out onto the great Eurasian plain. When
Khruschev and Stalin are judged at the bar of
history they, as the long line of Tsars, will justify
means of territories acquired. Expansion had be-
come a habit in Russia long before Lenin arrived

at the Finland Station. It would be an error,
therefore, to assume that the end of communism
in Russia would remove the Russian threat. Com-
munism is an enthusiasm-generating idea that
makes the Russians more effective in pursuing
traditional goals.

Some Washington and Lee students also wrong-
ly assume that arbitrary government and irregu-
lar succession to power in Russia is peculiar to
the Communist decades. Students of Russian his-
tory should know that Nicholas I had his third
section, and its functions and techniques were
similar to the secret police of Stalin. Political
police and arbitrary justice are common when
there is no rule of law and the Soviet system is
more in the Tsarist tradition than the Western
despite recent efforts in Russia to reform the
judicial establishment.

Irregular succession to power is also traditional
in Russia. Stalin and Khruschev won power by
techniques judged unconventional in the consti-
tution-minded Western nations, but the Era of
Palace Revolutions and the time of Troubles wit-
nessed maneuvering equally unorthodox.

Nor should it be forgotten that intricate
mechination which would have commanded the
respect of the Stalin of the ’20’s or the Khru-
schev of the ’50’s continually occurred around
the Russian throne. The power of the Tsar was
neither circumscribed nor regularized as stu-
dents of 19th century Russian political history
realize.

We have noted the carry-over of political,
economic, and foreign policy traditions into the
Communist era of Russian history and have im-
plied the maintenance of an authoritarian and
paternalistic ethos. The question now arises, what
have been the most dramatic changes occurring
within this traditional framework since 1917?
The answer is manifest in the headlines of our
daily papers—Russia has undergone an indus-
trial revolution.

If Russia had no transportation system knit-
ting together her far-flung resources and if she
had no communication system tying together her
decision-makers, her acceptance of the com-
munist ideology would be little more than a curi-
osity.

If Russia’s capacity to make steel and generate
power were not second only to ours, we would
view her with the contempt of the allied diplo-
mats of 1918 who knew that she could not sup-
port a modern army.

If Russia had not been able to take the lead
in making the most recent of the voyages of
discovery we could still argue that technology
could only flourish in a free-enterprise system.
As one of our great engineers recently observed,
missles are now made by gum-chewing young
ladies, Russian and American, who are often
oblivious to the economic system which feeds,
clothes, and entertains them.

A misconception among those who
are aware of the importance of rapid
industrialization in recent Russian his-
tory is the belief that this has been
the work of the Communists alone.

The industrial revolution began in
Russia under the Tsars during the late
19th century and the pattern of devol-
opment manifests continuity of growth.

Let’s Give College Athletic Conference py om

Washington and Lee, which seems to be in
a habit of helping form athletic conferences,
has taken another cautious step forward in its
non-subsidized athletic program in the forma-

things they said, * k &
“Not much, why?”
and “I don’t know,
I have never ex-
perienced it.”

Such actions
would not be—I
assume—uncommon among the stu-
dents here or anywhere else, except-
ing a few eggheads and pseudo-intel-
lectuals. There’s a general theory that
academic freedom, whatever that real-
ly is, doesn’t exist here or at many
other colleges. The reason for this
theory is—and I’m no exception—we
students don’t care whether academic
freedom exists or not. We plunk down
our $20 per semester hour and take
what the professor doles out, provided
the upperclassmen who have had the
course say it’s not too hard and the
cold quiz file is adequate. And who's
to blame the poor professors? After
all, they have dedicated a life time to
knowledge and if they are faced year
after year by apathetic students I can
see how if it might get discouraging
for them.

SPEAKING OF returns on the in-
vestment, “A Town Without Pity”
could only have been made for the
profits. Kirk Douglas, with the per-
sonality of a party balloon the morn-
ing after, saves the lives of four sex-
ual assaulters, who probably would
have been better off unborn, after they
“force” a 16-year-old fraulein who
likes to play Eve. Such themes are
better unexposed, even to the morally
bankrupt. The one saving grace to
the flick is uttered by a professional
who says, “That’s what happens when
you date townies,”

labored intelligently to initiate an in-
dustrial revolution but the economy
did not “take-off.” Peter was not
able to generate the enthusiasm nor
provide the educational foundation
necessary.

The notable development since 1870
has been the borrowing of advanced
European technology during the last
decades of the 19th century, the subse-
quent establishment by the Communist
regime of a system of technical educa-

of the Communists in persuading the
mass of Russians to take advantage

Supak, Paterno
Lead Generals
Over Lynchburg

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

For the

frightening experience.

With 12 minutes to go in
the Generals’ battle

erals held a commanding 48-34
lead.
Bang. Lynchburg rocketed away

and tied the score, 50-50 at the 6:00
mark.

Three minutes later the Generals,” ”"

were again resting comfortably with a
62-52 margin.

Bang. Lynchburg again rocketed
away. This time it tied the score, 66-
66, as the regulation game ended. On
came a five-minute overtime.

After three minutes of overtime
play, the Generals were on top for
the third time at 74-70.

Bang. Lynchburg’s rocket supply
seemed to be endless. The Hornets
now knotted the score at 74-74.

W&L crept back ahead on Louis
Paterno’s jump shot with 1:10 left.

Lynchburg was silent. Their rock-
et fuel failed. The Generals won
their third game of the season, 78-
74, in a truly hectic 45 minutes of
wild and wooly basketball.

The key to the Generals’ win was
a sophomore transfer—Tom Supak—
who had shown terrific scoring ability
until Saturday.

Not only did Supak score 30 points
but he also hit an amazing 13 of 16
shots from the floor for a .812 per-
centage.

Supak collected all but two of the
game’s important goals.

His long jump shot with 5:00 left in
the first half started the Generals
drive to a 28-20 halftime lead.

He then broke 50-50 and 70-70 ties
with a pair of lay-ups.

Bill Ide, whose lay-up tied the
score at 70-70 halfway through the
overtime and Paterno’s winning
jump shot were the other two im-
portant goals of the contest.

Paterno scored 13 points and Ide got
nine. Ide paced the rebounding with
13. Supak and Howard Martin each
grabbed nine and Paterno gathered in
eight.

Supak, Paterno, and Ide were the
individual stars but the rest of the
team were the game’s unsung heroes.

The Generals journey to Hampden-
Sydney tonight and return home Sat-
urday against Randolph-Macon.

 

Coming Events

ketball team will go against Hamp-

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

Coach Eastman’s swimming team
successfully defended its undefeated
record by easily outscoring the Dea-
cons of Wake Forest, 57-3, last Sat-
urday afternoon.

Harris and Jahncke

Record-breaking performances by
Mike Harris and Herb Jahncke high-
lighted the afternoon. Harris led the |

400 yard medley relay team of May-
nard, Warwick, and Monsarrat to vic-
tory with his record-breaking time of
1:01.2 in the 100-yard backstroke.

Jahnecke set a new record in the
200-yard individual medley relay with
a time of 2:13.5, shattering his own
pervious record of 2:17.1.

Also this year’s captain, Elliott May-

Jerry Kowalski Tops Scorers
In Frosh Win Over Fishburne

By BILL HILTON
Staff Reporter

Led by high-scoring Jerry Kowalski Washington and Lee’s
freshmen rolled over Fishburne Military Academy 65-41 last

Saturday afternoon.

Kowalski hit for 14 points and was high for the contest. Also in the scor-
ing columns for the Baby Generals were George Madison with 10, Don Liv-

ingston 10 and Dave Mosbough with 7*
markers.

Never in Trouble
W&L was never in trouble as they
jumped to an early lead and con-
tinued to build it even though Coach
Joe Lyles played all of his subs.

Showed Team Effort
The freshmen showed a fine team
effort and made Fishburne their fourth
victory against one loss for the sea-
son.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Let’s Support College Athletic Conference

(Continued from Page 2)
We heartly agree that W&L can defeat these
big-time opponents in some sports some of the
time; but the Generals cannot beat all these
big-timers in all the sports all of the time.

In fact, it is foolish to even suspect that
W&L could consistently or even occasional-
ly beat schools such as North Carolina, Wil-
lian & Mary, Virginia, Richmond, Wake For-
est, North Carolina State, and Duke in foot-
ball or basketball, the two backbones of any
athletic program.

It has taken seven long, hard years to build
up Washington & Lee’s successful non-subsi-
dized athletic program. Since the school is
winning on its present level, it realized that it
was time to strengthen its program. It did
so by the best way it knew how—the forma-
tion of an “amateur” conference with three
other non-subsidized schools. Being in a con-
ference creates a new spirit of competition,
gives the schools a goal to strive for in each
sport, and brings it wider recognition and
praise when it wins a conference title no mat-
ter how small the conference. After seven
years as an independent W&L deserves a
chance at a conference title again. The Col-
lege Athletic Conference gives it that chance.

The new conference admittedly has its
drawbacks: (1) It is too small with only four
members. (2) The members are too wide
spread. But it must be remembered that it is
hard to induce a large number of schools to
give up their independent status and join a
brand new conference before the conference

With the formation of the College Athletic
Conference Washington & Lee has, as the
Roanoke Times said editorially Sunday, “once
again demonstrated its determination to con-
tinue its sensible athletic policy, which in
sports jargon is ‘Simon Pure,” defined by the
dictionary as ‘genuine; authentic.’ ”

The College Athletic Conference with its
emphasis on “amateur athletics’? could be-
come a milestone in the returning of athletics
to a place of honor in institutions of higher
learning. Let’s give the conference a chance
to prove itself and not condemn it before it

gets started. —J.M.A.

Another Grid Honor

Washington’s Touchdown Club recently
named Washington and Lee as the nation’s
number one small college football team for
the 1961 season. We would like to second this
nomination and offer a few statistics from the
NCAA’s final report to back up this accolade.

Out of nine team categories W&L ranked
in the top ten in four of these groups—a
mark bettered by only one other school, Flor-
ida A&M. The Generals were ninth in scor-
ing with a 33.0 average; third in rushing de-
fense with a 52.6 mark; fourth in total defense
with a 115.9 average; and ninth in defense
against scoring with a 5.1 mark.

To Coach Lee McLaughlin and his unde-
feated five-star Generals we say:

Thanks for the priviledge of being able to
watch such a fine football team as you in ac-

 

has proven itself.
