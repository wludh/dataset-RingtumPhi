Irish Critic Speaks

 

Pleasure Aspect Of Fiction
Is Subject Of O’Faolain Talk

 

By TOM LYBASS
Associate Editor

How does one gain pleasure from
reading fiction?

This question Sean O’Faolain, Irish
writer and critic, discussed last night
in a lecture in Lee Chapel.

“In reading,” Mr. O’Faolain said,
“there is a certain projection be-
tween the book and the subject
beholding the book. It is by this
projection that the reader takes out
the pleasure locked up in the book.”

“Alloyed Pleasure”

Calling the projection form of
reading “alloyed pleasure,” Mr.
O’Faolain classified novelists as be-
ing either one of two types, either
a writer of novels giving pleasure
of the alloyed kind or a writer of
novels that does not give alloyed
pleasure.

Mr. O’Faolain said that alloyed
pleasure, which “allows one to alter
and modify what one reads and
sometimes to take out of a novel
what’s not in it,’ can be derived
from reading such writers as Dos-
toevsky, Conrad, James, and Colette.

Not Under Control

“The alloyed novelist’s personality
is not under control. He is only
getting affects by playing around.
Dostoevsky was one who allowed
himself to be carried on. Conrad is
also not clearheaded.”

“The great Stendhal and Abbe
Prevost are two writers that are
not alloyed. They cannot be ap-
proached on any account. While
reading them, it is impossible to
pour in our complexes and preju-
dices and take out more than the
author put in.”

Citing Joyce’s Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man as another
work of the unalloyed kind, Mr.
O’Faolain said, “It is the perfect
account of the agony of being young.
It is impossible to corrupt.”

Four Main Types
Mr. O’Faolain divided novels into
four main types: social, moralist, in-
terpretation, and unclassified.

“The social novel is the great
English forte, while the moralist
novel, which shows men living by a
technique of their own, as the great
quality of the French mind,” Mr.
O'Faolain said.

“Prophetic Quality”
“There is a prophetic quality in

by such writers as Faulkner and

“The uncalssified novelist such

Republicans, Conservatives Hold Meetings

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associatee Editor

Student political groups will kickoff their new
school year activities with organizational meetings this
week.

The Washington and Lee Young Republicans meet
tonight at 7 in the Student Union. The meeting will be
held before the freshman assembly.

Among the speakers will be Hank Oder, Rock-
bridge County Republican Chairman; Craig Distlehorst,
Region III Chairman of Organization for the Young
Republicans; and Charles Wright, the Virginia Vice
Chairman.

Oder will discuss the present gubernatorial race
in Virginia and how W&L Young Republicans can
participate. Distlehorst and Wright plan talks on the
Young Republican organization from the college to
the national level. A report will also be given on
the Young Republicans Convention held during the
past summer.

Committee To Be Formed

A nomination committee, composed of those who
wish to run for office or desire to serve on the com-
mittee, is to be formed. The committee will form an
election program, and elections will be held at the
next meeting.

Among the new activities slated by the club for this
year is a newspaper, which the club hopes will provide
a sounding board for student opinion on events of
national and international significance. The club also
hopes that political events on campus may be given
fuller discussion and coverage through the paper.

To Present Series
Following the gubernatorial election next month the

group, working with the United States Chamber of
Commerce, will present a series of discussions on prac-
tical polities. Guest speakers will be invited to guide
these discussions.

The club invites all student Republicans to attend
this first organizational meeting, even if they feel they
will not have time to actively participate in the club.
An inactive membership list will be drawn from these
students, and they will receive Republican announce-
ments.

Conservative Society

Also meeting this week is the newly formed Con-
servative Society of W&L. The society will hold its
opening meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday in duPont
auditorium.

The aim of the Conservative Society is to provide
“a medium through which interested students can ex-
press their views on conservative government.”

At the Wednesday meeting the new group’s leaders
will endeavor to explain further the aims and ideals
of the organization to all interested newcomers. The
group’s program for the coming semester will also be
discussed at this meeting.

“Uncas” McThenia, Society vice president, said that
the meeting is open to all who are interested in the
conservative philosophy of government; the student
body, townspeople, or other interested outsiders. Mc-
Thenia also said he expects a large turn-out for the
opening meeting.

Film To Be Shown

It was also announced that the film Communist
Encirclement 1961 will be shown Wednesday.

The conservative organization plans to establish a
speaker’s forum to bring to the campus prominent
conservative scholars, politicians and journalists.

‘Emphasis Abroad’ Program
Will Make Debut Wednesday
On Radio Washington And Lee

By STEVE GUILD

News Editor
which began its 1961-62 season

last night, will have a new look in programming this year.

* The schedule of shows has been
rearranged and an entirely new
foreign language show will make its
debut Wednesday.

The new show, Emphasis Abroad,
will be a foreign language cultural
show, which will feature a variety of
artists and performers connected
with several foreign countries.

The first show will survey the
popular music of France, including
such performers as Juliette Greco,
Yves Montand, and Maurice Che-
valier.

Producer Nick Denton stated that
“the purpose of the show is to add
to our
program which will appeal to stu-
dents, faculty, and other listeners.
We plan to have future shows based
on interviews, analyses, and special
reviews, in addition to the popular
music segments.”

The show will originate from the
studios of Radio Washington and Lee
and will be planned, produced, and
directed by the staff of Radio W&L,
with the cooperation of interested
faculty members and students.

The other programs on the Radio
Washington and Lee schedule will
be basically the same this year as
in the past. Pre Musica, the Monday
night show, will be produced by
Peter Lynn. The program for the
show will consist of heavy classical
music, opera, and contemporary
composers. Engineers for Monday
night are Lynn Hammond and Til-

Openings To Feature Clovers

Dave Montgomery To Be Honored
At Openings Cocktail Party

By KEN LANE and JACK DeJARNETTE
Tuesday Staff Writers

The Clovers, backed up by the sounds of the Dukes of
Rhythm, will highlight the Delt’s cocktail party on Friday of
Openings Weekend, it was announced today.

Consisting of five singers and an instrumentalist, the Clov-

ers have held the spotlight in

55 Freshmen Eligible
For Deferred Rush;
Combo Costs Studied

By T. D. EDWARDS
Associate Editor
IFC President Bob Doenges an-
nounced last night at the IFC meet-
ing that 55 freshmen are eligible for
deferred rush.

The names of the freshmen that
are interested in the fraternities can
not be published under IFC rules,
he said, and urged all the rush
chairmen to go by the Dean’s office
to get their fraternity’s copy.

Beginning on October 18, which is
four weeks after the official end of
rush week, deferred rush will con-
tinue throughout the year.

To Petition Faculty

In view of the short period be-
tween Thanksgiving and Christmas
holidays, Steve Rutledge, Phi Gam
president, proposed that the IFC
president appear before the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities and re-
quest that eight fraternities be al-
lowed to have house parties on the
weekend of December 2 and that
eight more be allowed to have
parties on the following weekend.
The rule now states that only five
houses are allowed parties on any
one weekend.

Should the request be denied by
the committee, it was pointed out,
only ten of the fraternities will be
able to have parties in accordance
with the present limit on the num-
ber of parties. Two fraternities in-
dicated that they are not planning
any Christmas activity.

Homecomings To Feature
Changes, Innovations

For the first time in recent years,
Homecomings and Openings Dances
will be combined into a single week-
end.

Another innovation will be the pep
rally to be held outside the gym-
nasium on Friday night of that
weekend. At this rally, the Home-
coming Queen will be chosen.

Because of the combined weekend,
fraternities are encouraged to have
their decorations finished by 4 p.m.
Friday 13th. The decorations will
be judged between 4 p.m. and mid-

| night.

This year a student committee is
assisting the Alumni Secretary and
the Dance Board in preparations
for the weekend,

 

the popular music field since

*their first recording in 1950.

Some of their outstanding releases
are “Love Love Love,” “Middle of
the Night,” and “Devil or Angel.”
Noted for their versatility, this group
has put out five successful albums,
and has performed concerts through-
out the country.

Still composed of its original mem-
bers, John (Buddy) Bailey and Billy
Mitchell, lead tenors, Matt Mc-
Quater, second tenor, Hal Lucas, Jr.,
baritone, Hal Winley, bass, and Bill
Harris, instrumentalist, the Clovers
have enjoyed undiminished popular-
ity during their eleven-year career.
Originating in the Washington-Bal-
timore area, they quickly gained
prominence in the music world with
a style similar to that of the Platters.

“The Clovers take the music and
the words and balance them delight-
fully somewhere between rhythm
and feeling, and the resulting rendi-
tion leaves in your ears the delicate
aftertaste of an expertly seasoned
ragout...’, comments columnist Les
Matthews of the New York Age
Defenders.

The cocktail party is begin given
in honor of Delt junior Dave Mont-
gomery, President of Openings
Dance. It will take place in the
Mayflower Hotel, October 13th, from
4 until 6 p.m.

The Faculty Social Committee
has announced its decision on the
requirements for dress at the
Openings Dance on _ Saturday,
October 14.

They have stated that dress will
be semi-formal. No polished cot-
tons or tennis sneakers will be al-
lowed at the dance Saturday.
Girls will be required to wear
cocktail dresses. The Floor Com-
mittee will reserve the right to
turn away anyone who is not in
suitable dress.

Delt Senior and Social Chairman
Will Lee states that this should be
one of the first truly successful
big weekend cocktail parties. “Usu-
ally,” Lee recalls, “there is such a
crowd that you can’t hear what’s
going on; it’s a big waste of talent.”

This year, Lee has planned to
install 13 or 14 big amplifiers to
help out the acoustics. In addition
a new bandstand is going to be built.
“Also,” Lee added, “the brew will
be of a finer quality than usual—
the best scotch and bourbon we ean
get.”

The Delt cocktail party is the first
of many events scheduled for Open-
ings Weekend. At eight o’clock in
the gym, Hank Ballard and his
Midnighters, the Edsels, and the
Isley Brothers will give a concert.
Hank Ballard is well known for his
hit records, “Annie Had a Baby,”
“Sexy Ways,” “Henry’s Got Flat

LEADERSHIP TESTS? NO!
(Continued from page 1)

 

The second area in the proposed revision which we disagree
with is the idea of leadership tests. Such tests would be given
candidates to determine their “intelligence and general ability;
initiative; resourcefulness and creative ability; and leadership
ability.” To this suggestion we feel we must say that this area
has little or no value to us at all.

The idea that the results of the tests be publicly posted and
written on all the ballots appears to us as being a blow to the
candidate’s integrity and to his good name. Under this pro-
posed system the candidates will become the object of ridicule
and cynicism.

We need leaders—men with good ideas and good
heads—not some “goons” or “‘eggheads” who may happen
to score perfect on a test which we feel could not possibly
determine a candidate’s leadership ability that will be dem-
onstrated in some future office.

We sincerely doubt the validity of such test—and we en-
dorse the belief that this proposal is also “absurd and that it
is further a ridiculous, unnecessary and, above all, a senseless
move.”

It must be realized that the political parties will only sup-
port and endorse qualified candidates. (It’s sure suicide if the
parties don’t push men with both excellent academic and cam-
pus standings.) We must have faith in our parties and in our
candidates! If we lose this basic faith in our chosen parties,
then we stand to become people who are “. . . full of sound and
fury, signifying nothing.”

We feel that Mr. Paul’s proposal also has its good sides.
His suggestion that the legislative meetings be open to the
press we feel is excellent, and we endorse this idea whole-
heartedly. We agree with him that there is no need for the
constitution to give a long and drawn out explanation con-
cerning the election of cheerleaders and members of the
Cotillion Club. These suggestions merit serious consideration
by the Executive Committee.

Changes, as we have said, must be warranted. Change
should never be initiated merely for the sake of change itself.
This type of irresponsible action leads only to real trouble. The
poll tax and the leadership tests do not represent the best
means for electing our officials. We only hope that the Execu-
tive Committee will agree.

SERIES OF AMENDMENTS ISN’T THE ANSWER

If the E. C. wants to strengthen its position on this campus,
and if the E. C. feels that organizations such as the Student
Library Committee, the Assimilation Committee and the
Cold Check Committee need more power, then we say give
these committees the power to act.

Reformers, don’t tie the E. C.’s hands with shouts of
“constitutional ammendment” every time someone unlaw-
check, or fails to wear his beanie, or everytime someone unlaw-
fully removes a book from the library.

As the Friday Edition said, “These needs will not be met
by constitutional ammendments but rather by more imaginative
use of the influence of the Executive Committee.”

We hope that students won’t resort to this “sound and
fury” over the constitution at every turn in the road of legisla-
tion.

Let us forget such proposals as the poll tax and the leader-
ship tests. Let us move to more important matters. Let us regain
our senses when it comes to matters concerning the Executive
Committee, our student body organization which safeguards
our most cherished traditions. Let us once again have faith in
those we have elected. Let us once again see that intelligent
change is the correct answer—the only answer that will work.

STUDENT INTEREST NEEDED

Two of Washington and Lee’s newest clubs will hold their
meetings tonight and tomorrow. We are speaking of the newly
formed Young Republicans and the Conservative Society.

It is our hope that Washington and Lee students will both
join and support these clubs. The persons who have organized
these clubs have put much effort into them. It would indeed be
a shame if these clubs failed due to a lack of student support.
Good luck politicians!

ment of Washington and Lee’s rapid-

As Others See Us

Poll Reveals:
Hollins
Likes W&L

By Ring-tum Phi Staff
Hollins College Bureau

Well, Gentlemen, Hollins’ girls ap-
prove of us.

Our roving reporter at Hollins
asked 30 girls there, “Do you like
W&L?”

Fifteen indicated they liked W&L
and twelve didn’t like W&L. (The
other three were fish and don’t
count.)

Why do these 15 girls like W&L?
Well...

I. “It’s fun if you know the boys
in the house you are dating.”

2. “It’s enjoyable if you’re with
the right person, otherwise it’s bet-
ter to go up North.”

3. The combos are fabulous and
the parties are a lot of fun.”

4. “W&L is close and we can go
there without taking overnights.” (A
sly reason if there ever was one).

5. “The boys are nice and we
hear they dress nicely.”

6. “It’s a better way to spend
Saturday night than in the library.”
(Yeh, man or woman!)

7. “The boys themselves are nice,
but when they get together, they
act like a bunch of idiots. They
put on false fronts and spend their
time seeing who can drink the
most.”

8. “It’s fun, but then, I haven’t
been there very much.”

9. “I like it, but not as much as
Virginia.” (True Southern lass.)

10 “The boys there are smarter
than the ones at Vriginia.” (That'll
show those Wahoos.)

11. “They are a lot of fun if they
don’t get drunk and attack their
dates.” (Wolf, Wolf.)

On the other side of the fence
were those who don’t like W&L
because...

1. “There are absolutely no indi-
viduals at W&L.”

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

Alumni secretary Bill Washburn
said the occupational file is being
established “so that we can answer
the ever-growing number of queries
we receive concerning the quality
of our products—that is, the individ-
ual contributions being made to so-
ciety by Washington and Lee gradu-
ates.”

Washburn explained that occu-
pational records are used by many
large philantrophic foundations as
a criteria for awarding of grants
and funds.

“After our files are established
we will be able to tell them exactly
how many of our graduates are
doctors, lawyers, businessmen, jour-
nalists, teachers, and so on. And we
are confident that the information
will be impressive,’ Washburn
stated.

At present, according to Wash-
burn, the alumni files list occupa-
tions, but is is virtually impossible
to compile a statistical breakdown,
and, even if a breakdown were pos-
sible, the information would be over
14 years out of date.

To bring the files up to date and
in the form of a complete statistical
cataloging, the alumni association is
mailing forms to 11,000 W&L gradu-
ates, asking each alumnus to list the
firm or institution with which he is
associated, the type of business it
performs, and the position he holds
with the institution.

The alumnus is also asked to cata-
log his occupation under one of
fourteen general areas: accounting,
architecture, the arts, business and
industry, religion, communications
and entertainment, education, en-
gineering, government, medical arts,
health service, law, science, student
and miscellaneous.

Other information requested in-
cludes academic degree and major
subject, church affiliation, career
honors, and directorship or trus-
teeship positions.

Two pages of the form are blank,
with the alumnus urged to include
pertinent information about his oc-
cupation or his role in society on
these two pages.

“We realize that many men make
their main contribution to society
through community activity rather
than occupational activity, and of
course we are vitally interested in
this,’ Washburn said.

The Alumni Association plans
to follow up the original mailing
of this form with four or five per-
sonal letters to those alumni not
returning forms. Washburn said
this program should enable the As-

sociation to realize a return of be-
tween 75 and 80 per cent of the
forms, the figure which he termed
necessary for an accurate statisti-
cal breakdown.

America ‘Like Home’
Says Paul Ojermark

‘But Cars Are Bigger, Roads Wider,
Buildings Taller, People Friendlier’

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Assistant Managing Editor

(Editor’s Note: This is the first in a series of articles about the
foreign students attending Washington and Lee this year.)

“Tt’s almost like home.”

That’s Gunner Paul Ojermark’s opinion of the United
States. Ojermark, from Saffle, Sweden, is one of seven foreign
students studying at Washington and Lee this year.

Ojermark, who speaks four lan- *

guages, is quite a traveler. He
has visited 10 European countries,
including France, Italy, England,
and Germany; Canada; and now
the United States.

“Going to a Southern European
country like France or Italy is like
entering a new world,” Ojermark
says. “But coming to the United
States is almost like being at home.”

Why is the United States like

Virginia has a new governor. He was elected in the
best Byrd tradition in the Democratic primary last
summer.

A. E. S. Stephens, who devoted his life (including
the last eight years as Lt. Governor) to service in the
politics of the Old Dominion didn’t
have a prayer of a chance. Now all
the voters have to do is put the
A-Okay on Albertis Harrison in
the November election.

The GOP also has a name on
the ballot, but I'll wager not one
in fifty voters in Virginia could tell
you who he is. And not one in a
hundred voters will mark the box
by his name.

RES IPSA_ LOQUITUR

 

Fortunately, however, I took a
little trip over the weekend to
see a big-time football game, and
I think a description of that spec-
tacle, plus a little description of
life on a co-ed campus, should
suffice for this week’s bedtime
story.

To begin with the game: You
should really see one once. TV really
doesn’t do them justice.

It’s almost like Ben-Hur. They
have bands with some people over
six feet tall, and no midgets at
all

At the one I saw they had a Civil
War battle at the half. No buses full
of Minks, no townie intramural
games, but an actual battle. It was
put on by a re-activated Confeder-
ate battalion.

Before Saturday I was sort of
worried about the draft, and the
activation of National Guard units,
and all that; but after seeing a
real Civil War unit—muskets and
moth-eaten uniforms included—
I'm really sweating it. ROTC is
doomed. And so are all us 2-S’s.

But I digress from the football
game. They also had chicks on
floats to ride around the field—in
bathing suits. Again, no buses, on
tanks from VMI, no Lexington High
School cross-country team, but
chicks in bikinis. They were all on
floats that said “Salute to Beauty,”
“Salute to Industry,” and one even
said “Salute to the American Way
of Life.” I caught the name of the
girl on that one—Rodriguez. What
a way of life!

Well, that was the game, so on to
the social life where boys go to
school with unmarried girls. After
the game each fraternity has a little
open house. I walked into one at
about eleven o’clock, and met the

house president. After exchanging
greetings, I said:

“Nice place you have here,
George. Where’s the bar?”
George said proudly: “Oh, we

have no bar. No drinking on this
campus.”

“Oh,” I said, swallowing hardly.
(Or was it hardly swallowing—I
can’t remember.)

Then I asked about women. With
a subtle touch, I said:

“Well, how about women? Can
I get one for the rest of the party?”

George said: “Sure, they outnum-
ber the boys here, or it wouldn’t be
any use. They have to be in at

it, but Sweden is the most “Amer-
icanized” country in Europe.

Like most American teenagers,
the young Swedes have cars in
high school, like rock ’n’ roll,
and dance on weekends, and gen-
erally aren’t restricted in their so-
cial activities, Ojermark points out.

But of course, there are differ-
ences.

“In America the cars are bigger,
the roads wider and better, the
buildings taller, and the people
friendlier.

“The one thing that has impressed
me most so far is the friendliness
of the Americans. They are friend-
lier and more hospitable than any
other people I’ve met.”

WORLD ECONOMY and politics
fascinate Ojermark, who is studying
political science, economics, and
English at Washington and Lee.

“I find that the American students
are keenly aware of both their coun-
try’s political situation and the world
political situation. This is very im-
pressive because in Sweden this po-
litical awareness on the students’
part is lacking.”

Ojermark says he hasn’t decided
on his career, but it’s easy to tell
that he’s politically inclined.

“I might enter the international
political or economic field,” he says.
* + *
“POTATOES. I miss potatoes
most,” Ojermark said in answering
how he likes American food. “We
eat potatoes at least once every day,

but you don’t.

“But I do like the meat and salads
here. The meat is tender whereas
it’s usually tough in Europe.”

The weather is Ojermark’s only
disappointment.

“I wish it was a little warmer.
Maybe I should have gone to the
University of Miami (Florida),” he
says jokingly.

Offensive Mistakes Spell 12-0 Doom
For Frosh At Woodberry Forest

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team dropped its opening
game, 12-0, to Woodberry Forest
last Saturday.

Although the Baby Generals con-
trolled the ball in the hard fought
contest, they made too many of-
fensive mistakes and failed to cap-
italize on Woodberry’s errors.

W&L Marches

In the first quarter, W&L made
its biggest bid to break into the scor-
ing column, when they marched
eighty yards to the Woodberry one,
where they lost the ball on downs.

Late in the second quarter, Wood-
berry gained possession of the ball
inside the Baby Generals’ ten, after
a bad snap from center.

 

Woodberry scores

W&L’s small but spirited line held
them three times, but a short pass
from quarterback Tysner to right
end Hunter Spruill gave the home
team a 6-0 halftime lead.

The second half was a repeat of
the first as W&L continued to ad-
vance the ball into Woodberry’s ter-
ritory only to lose the ball because
of a fumble or an offsides penalty.

Woodberry added its final touch-
down midway in the third period
when halfback Bill Shawb raced
eighty after shaking off a would-be
W&L tackler.

After the game, Coach Swan said
he was as pleased as he could be,
under the circumstances, with the

 

team’s overall performance and that
the difference in the amount of pre-
season practice kept W&L from
victory.

He stressed the complete team
effort and ended by saying, “We
have the making of a good, hust-
ling ball club, and we will be
tough to beat in our remaining
games.”

The Baby Generals will play Fer-
rum Jr. College this Saturday.

Five Star Generals Face Franklin And Marshall;

“They are bigger than we in

Lee McLaughlin as he prepares to
lead his charges against Franklin

The coaching staff and the Five
Star Generals will be looking for
their 11th straight game without a
W&L defeat.

Tom Clements, a Phi Psi junior

College soccer match Friday.

Coach Joe Lyles pointed out that
Clements’ “aggressive, rugged play”

Pfeiffer retaliated several minutes

There was no scoring in the final
period though W&L dominated the
play in their futile attempt to get

the difference between winning and

Loves of Dobie Gillis’, etc.)

SAIL ON, SAIL ON!

I suppose October 12 is just another day to you. You get up in
the ordinary way and do all the ordinary things you ordinarily
do. You have your breakfast, you walk your ocelot, you go to
classes, you write home for money, you burn the dean in effigy,
you watch Howdy-Doody, and you go to bed. And do you give
one little thought to the fact that October 12 is Columbus
Day? No, you do not.

Nobody thinks about Columbus these days. Let us, there-
fore, pause for a moment and retell his ever-glorious, endlessly
stirring saga.

(onus cree gn

Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451.
His father, Ralph T. Columbus, was in the three-minute auto
wash game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a
sprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four
brothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,
young Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.
However, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader
and spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortu-
nately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time—Care of
the Horse by Aristotle—and after several years of reading Care
of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor reached
him that there was another book in Barcelona, off he ran as
fast as his fat little legs would carry him.

The rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona
was Cuidar un Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing
more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.

Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going
to India where, according to legend, there were thousands of
books. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and
after so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus
never wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought
struck him: perhaps it was possible to get to India by sea!

Fired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Colum-
bus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his
life) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers were
persuaded.

On October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World.
The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders
never before seen in Europe—spices and metals and plants and
flowers and—most wondrous of all—tobacco! Oh, what a sensa-
tion tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had long since been
invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer,
made still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco
in front of it, and invented the world’s first filter cigarette!

Through the centuries filters have been steadily improved
and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate
in the filter cigarette—Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great filter, great smoke!
And so, good friends, when next you enjoy a fine Marlboro
Cigarette, give a thought to the plucky Genoese, Christopher
Columbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole
lovely thing possible.

© 1961 Max Shulman

And thank Columbus too for the king-size Philip Morris
Commander. If unfiltered cigarettes are your choice, you’ ll

find Commander the choice of the unfiltered. Welcome
aboard.
