INDEPENDENTS SELECT CANDIDATES

PAYNE-CHRISTIAN-LANE SEEK BIG THREE POSITIONS

By STEVE GUILD
Executive News Editor

The Independent Party announced
last night its slate of candidates for
the “Big Seven” offices of the stu-
dent body. The formal announce-
ment of the candidates came at last
night’s nominating convention in Lee
Chapel, although the candidates had
been selected at a series of party
“clique” meetings during the past
week.

Nominated for president of the
student body was Bob Payne, Delt
junior from Louisville, Kentucky.

Candidates Officially Nominated
In Lee Chapel Convention

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The slates of the University and
Independent parties were officially
presented last night in a convention
that will go down in the annals of
Washington and Lee University.

Marking the University’s last
nominating convention, this year’s
convocation will serve as a memor-
able signpost in the political history
of W&L.

For if the new EC constitution is
ratified by the student body at the
polls this Thursday, and by all pre-
dictions this is what will happen,
then what has become a merely per-
functory ceremony will be perman-
ently blotted out of succeeding elec-
tions. :

None the less significant were
the candidates nominated for the
two parties, promising a closely
matched campaign all along the
line.

The slate for the University party
is as follows: Tim Ireland, PiKA, for

Dance Board
To Sponsor Poll

In an effort to feel out the
tastes of the student body as a
whole, the Dance Board is
sponsoring a poll to be includ-
ed on the election ballot this
Thursday. The poll will con-
cern next year’s dance sets, in
particular Fancy Dress and
Springs.

The first question asks: For the
Fancy Dress Ball next year would
you be in favor of (1) the tradi-
tional costume ball or (2) the full-
dress “High Society” ball similar
to the one held this year.

Secondly, would you be in favor
of an invitational “Folk Festival” to
be held here next Spring in which
a professional group would perform
Friday night and judge several ama-
teur groups that would perform
Saturday night. A final question al-
lows students to list their four fav-
orite entertainment groups as sug-
gestions for next year.

Frank Young, president-elect of
the Dance Board, is hopeful of posi-
tive results from the poll. Comment-
ing on the idea of an invitational
folk festival, he stated that “there
has been a rising interest in this
tradition and there are various ama-
teur groups all over the country
who offer talent comparable to the
highest paid entertainers.”

 

 

 

Running with Payne will be Meade
Christian, vice-president, and Chuck
Lane, secretary.

The candidates from the Indepen-
dent Party for the four dance sets
presidents are Roger Paine, Fancy
Dress; Ross Kyger, Finals; Mike
Harris, Openings; and Dan Balfour,
Springs.

Bob Payne is editor of the 1963

Independent Slate

The slate for the Independent par-
ty is as follows; Bob Payne, DTD,
for president; Meade Christian, Phi
Gam, for vice-president; Chuck
Lane, DTD, for secretary; Mike Har-
ris, Phi Psi, for president of Open-
ings; Dan Balfour, SPE, for presi-
dent of Springs; Ross Kyger, Kap-
pa Sig, for president of Finals; and
Roger Paine, Phi Gam, for president
of Fancy Dress. ((See story on this
page.)

Nomination Speeches

Among the impressive nominating

speeches presented were those of

 

Rosie Page, Steve Suttle, and Robin
Wood. Rosie forcefully spoke out
against an attack on Tim Ireland as
“riding the gravey-train” to office.

Steve Suttle aroused a few chuck-
les in his eulogy paid to the chair-
man of the convention, Bll Outman.
Robin Wood struck home for his
candidates by relating a knee-slap-
ping anecdote.

The convention was also the
scene for a dramatic demonstra-
tion. During the course of the
proceedings, the entire non-fra-
ternity delegation rose from their
seats and marched en masse out of
the convention leaving a notice-
able vacuum in the middle of Lee
Chapel.

A spokesman for the group later
explained that the act was meant to
remind the two parties of its repre-
sentation as a considerable segment
of the voting power.

 

Candidates Express Views
At Student-Held Forum

By JACK DEJARNETTE

Writer

“Increased freshman representation on student body com-
mittees will give desired and necessary experience as well as

pointing out to some extent the l
said Tim Ireland in last night’s*
forum following the student body
nominating convention.

In reply to this statement, Meade
Christian, Independent Pary candi-
date for Vice President said that he
did not feel that this would be in
the best interest of the University
or of the Freshman class because he
felt that they would not have been
sufficiently assimilated during the
first part of their first year to be of
real service to the University. He
pointed out the fact that he had
spent six months on the Executive
Committee this year before he felt
qualified to speak out strongly in
that committee’s affairs.

Both parties seemed to feel that
assimilation and _ student-faculty
relationships are the basic issues of
this year’s campaign. Bob Payne, In-
dependent Party candidate for
president, felt, “This assimilation can
be properly accomplished by the
end of the first term so that Fresh-
men will be qualified to assume
various responsibilities by the sec-
ond semester of their freshman
year.”

In what might have been a move
to ward off a heated debate, Payne
opened his remarks with an apolo-

 

eaders in each freshman class,”

 

gy to Lanny Butler and the Univer-
sity Party for the use of the word
“hypocritical” in a statement which
the Independent Party issued last
Saturday morning.

Each candidate was asked to say
why he thought himself qualified
for the particular post for which he
was running.

Chuck Lane said that he thought
that he had the qualifications, the
time, and the fresh blood which
would be beneficial to the student
body. He also added that he did not
believe that experience on th Ex-
ecutive Committee was a necessary
qualification for holding an office.

Butler felt the experience which
he has gained on the staff of the
Ring-tum Phi has kept him in close

that this was something to be de-
sired.

Meade Christian thought his ex-
perience on the EC this year was in-
valuable. He also stressed the fact
that he would devote his greatest
energies to doing a good job as Vice
President. Said Christian, “I feel that

Independent Party Publishes

Platform For Coming Election

THE PLATFORM

1. We support the new constitution
ratified by the EC, which would pro-
vide, in particular, for a petition pro-
cedure to replace the nominating
convention as the method of nomi-
nating candidates ;and for assump-
tion by officers of the senior, junior,
and sophomore class, of the responsi-
bilities now held by presidents of
Finals, Openings, and Spring Dances,
respectively.

We favor these changes: (a)
because the new method of nomi-
nation would be more democratic,
allowing for the nomination of more
than two candidates; and (b) be-
cause the positions of class officers
would be given meaning and pur-
pose, the expensive and wasteful
practice of fraternity-financed par-
ties in honor of the dance-set pres-
idents would be abolished, and class
unity would be strengthened
through an essentially class activity.

 

2. The Independent Party spon-
sored petition to replace the Publi-
cations Board representative to the
EC with a second junior class rep-
resentative.

3. The Sigma Delta Chi-sponsored
petition to open legislative meetings
of the EC to representatives from

 

the student press.

This

contact with the student body, and |

would be neglecting its duty to the
student electorate if it failed to sup-
port in practice these basic tenets.

4. The election of the President of

| the IFC by student-wide fraternity |

voting.

This step is toward greater de-
|mocracy. Therefore, we support it.
But it is also part of our desire to

be affirmative in our actions, to sup- |
| port the IFC, to further the course }

of fraternity-faculty relations, and
especially to improve the social life
of the student body, in the best sense
of the word.

5. A program to promote greater
cooperation between the EC and the
dormitory counselors in explaining
and interpreting the Honor System
and student government institutions
to the freshmen.

The need for heightened activity
with regard to assimilating incoming
freshmen to our way of life here at
W&L is painfully acute. We feel that
we have the solution to the problem.
It is a concrete program we pro-
pose, whereby dorm counselors who
are in the best positions to do so
will work with the EC to promote
understanding and knowledge, with
special attention to the Honor Sys-
tem.

Student Body Address

As an extension of this policy,
we support the adoption of an an-
nual practice which might be term-
ed, “The State of the Student Body
Address,’ whereby the President of
the Executive Committee would pre-
sent at a general student body as-
sembly the facts of his administra-
tion, the typical problems facing stu-
dent government and the student
body, and so on.

 

These are the planks of our plat-
form. We believe sincerely in what
we have proposed. Whether or not
| they are original suggestions is un-
important, compared to our deter-
imination if elected, to carry
| promises out.

The Independent Party issued a
statement of their platform on Fri-
day morning as did the University
Party in Friday’s Ring-tum Phi.
Both platforms, as it stands now,
contain essentially the same points.
The University Party has proposed
freshman class officers and positions
on committees, while the Indepen-
dent Party has taken issue with it in
the enlarged statement of purpose
(See elsewhere on this page) which
was issued this morning.

The Independent Party has also
proposed a state of the student body
address to be delivered by the pres-
ident of the student body in an an-
nual assembly.

Both Parties’ “Big Three” candi-
dates will participate in an Execu-
tive Committee-sponsored assembly
period on the current issues in
duPont Auditorium at 7:00 on
Wednesday night. At this meeting
the candidates will present views
in prepared speeches and afterwards
the floor will be open for questions.

New Calyx
To Arrive
Next Week

The 1962 Calyx will prob-
ably be distributed to the stu-
dent body during the first part
of next week, announced edi-
tor Joe Goldstein today. Gold-
stein said the theme of the
yearbook is ‘“The Washington
and Lee Swings.”

 

The Calyx will be shipped from
the printer Friday and will be dis-
tributed from the Student Union
upon arrival.

The 1962 yearbook will be dedicat-
ed to “two of the younger members
of the faculty,” who “represent the
progressive course that our Uni-
versity has pursued during the past
few years.” In effect, said Gold-
stein, these two symbolize the spirit
of the W&L Swing.

To carry out the theme, various
lines from the song will be used in
illustrating the seven phases of
life depicted. The first line, “When
Washington and Lee’s men fall in
line...” will be associated with the
Class section; the Social Fraternity
section will feature “...Roll old
Sweet Briar on the Sod!”

Major innovations in the annual
this year include a two-page color
spread, the first in several years.

For the first time, the Board of
Trustees will be included in the
book. The group faculty picture is
eliminated and six pages are devoted
to the faculty, with the heads of the
18 academic departments featured in
individual candid shots.

All pictures in the book indentified
with captions and all activities will
be given write-ups as to their pur-
pose, function, ete.

Honorary fraternities will be giv-
en a separate section this year to

 

our |

play up the eight honor groups on
campus.

Other changed sections include
fraternities, Beauty Court, freshman

| sports, and football.

Goldstein attributed the early

| publication of the Calyx largely to

the efforts of Herb Salomon and

Union | Bob Payne, managing editors, and

Robin Wood, business manager.

Students Should Vote Wisely
In Campus Elections Thursday

It is encouraging to the Tuesday Edition that leaders of
both campus political parties have chosen to endorse the amend-
ment to the Student Body Constitution which would guarantee
press representation at the Executive Committee’s legislative
meetings.

 

As we said in an editorial last week, we feel that the campus
press should be given constitutional protection of its inherent
right to be present at legislative meetings of the EC.

It would seem that since both parties have expressed their
approval of the idea, the matter virtually has already been
decided.

The matter cannot be decided, however, until the Student
Body by its vote passes the amendment. Each and every mem-
ber of the Student Body will have their chance to vote on this
matter, and other important matters this Thursday.

We sincerely hope that this election won’t be marred by a
poor turnout at the polls, and that the students will familarize
themselves with the proposed Constitutions, the candidates, and
the amendments so that they can cast intelligent votes.

Eliminate Mud Slinging,
Put Emphasis On Issues

Once again, the campus is overrun with campaign posters
of the two political parties. However, this campaign that is be-
ing waged this year is a far cry from the one that took place
a year ago.

Both parties have presented their candidates and both
have presented their platforms. It is interesting to note that
the platforms of the two groups are remarkably similar. Both
stand for good government, and both support the much talked
about changes in the student body constitution. Neither party
has come up with anything truly new and different.

It appears that this year’s elections will be a repetition of
the old party politics of the past. The several positigns will go
to the party with the most members. Thus, for all practical
purposes, the election virtually is decided before it is run.

However, it is unfortunate to see the mud throwing and
back stabbing that both parties have been engaged in. Both
parties have nominated able candidates and any of these can-
didates can serve well. Therefore, it is wholly unnecessary to
draw attention away from what issues there are with such moves.

While we realize that a degree of this is always associated
with politics, it is our feeling that more emphasis should be
placed on the issues themselves and not on petty matters of
little concern.

—G. A. N.

Cocktail Party Should Remain

A long standing tradition of dance sets at Washington and
Lee is the cocktail party that is sponsored by the president of
the dance set’s fraternity. While this may be a luxurious waste
of money, it is a definite part of our traditions.

The new Student Body Constitution will place the class
presidents in charge of the dance sets. What will happen to the
cocktail party? Will it become, like many of our traditions, a
thing of the past?

There are two possible solutions to the matter. One is that
the fraternity of the class president could continue to sponsor
the cocktail party. However, a second and more practical solu-
tion would be to distribute the cost of the cocktail party over
the respective class.

The advantages of distributing the cost of the cocktail party
over an entire class are many. It would ease the financial bur-
den of all concerned. Further, it would help to promote a
larger measure of class unity as each member of the class would
have an interest. Finally, it would give the other class officers a
long needed function.

No matter what plan is adopted, we hope that the traditional
cocktail party will remain one of our traditions and not become
a thing of the past.

Respectfully

A Freshman

While I showed last week that
there is some justification for the
faculty move in their eyes, there
seems to be little justification from
the student point of view

The action brings to mind Wood-
row Wilson’s statement about “a
little group of willful men” who
thwarted the will of the majority.

The IFC tried strong action and
the students rejected it. The IFC
tried a more acceptable compromise
and the faculty rejected it. Such a
position is too close to being impos-
sible to expect very much of the
IFC unless the representatives can
be given a free hand to vote as they
personally see fit.

Back to the question at hand, how-
ever, there is very little the student |
body can do except bemoan the |
faculty committee action—at least |
at this time. However, there is a
day coming when we “down-trod-
den” undergraduates will become
alumni, and then we can show our
due appreciation.

* ye *

I CAN not bring myself to be-,
lieve that Washington and Lee has
gone anti-fraternity. It is very true
that a vocal minority on the faculty
holds such sentiments, but it would
be interesting to see what the vote
would have been if the entire fac-
ulty had voted on the social com-
mittee’s resolution.

* ee ft

I ALSO wonder about the real
merit of keeping candidates for stu-
dent body offices out of the dorm.
Freshmen often do not know the}
candidates very well anyway, and
campaigning in the dorms gives
them some idea what these men are
really like. The object of such a
move apparently is grounded in |
merit, but the alternative of having
the candidates campaign where they |
please seems to be in the better in- |
terest of the student body as a
whole.

3 New
Proposals
On Ballot

In addition to the Executive Com-
mittee’s proposed new constitution,
three other amendments will appear
on the ballot in Thursday’s student
body elections.

The EC constitution has been ap-
proved by a two-thirds vote of the
EC and will require only a majority
vote from the student body to be
approved The other three amend-
ments were presented by student
petition and will require a_ two-
thirds majority vote from the stu-
dent body to be approved.

There will be another entirely new
constitution presented by the editors
of Pretest. This document will set
up the posts of “advisor” to the ac-
cused, and “examiner” in Honor
trials. Ben Brown, one of the Pro-
test editors, says this arrangement
will create a better psychological
atmosphere at trials.

The Protest constitution also pro-
vides for a student senate, which will

Of course everyone these days is
talking about faculty interference
in student social affairs, and how it
it is none of their “damn” business
what we do on Saturday nights—
especially the Saturday night of
dance weekends.

All of this talk is good, I think,
for it now shows that W&L students
are not really apathetic. And it does
broaden the dinner-table conversa-
tion just a little bit.

But as for all the talk I’ve heard
about the latest move of “the
Hill,” the faculty seems to be
getting the short end of the stick.
I've yet to hear anybody come out
in support of the combo-crush-
ing action, at least come out in
public. This should not be.

Many times over the course of the |
past two years I have taken the
side of the faculty during similar

these wise men know far better how
students can most beneficially spend
their time and money. After all, if
we don’t question them in the class-
room, why should we do so outside?

Despite my wholehearted support
of their latest move, several points
are troubling me about this decision.
Chief among these is the appearance
that these faculty committees seem
to prefer to work in slow steps
rather than take an occasional bold,
daring, and exciting leap. For ex-
ample:

One of the biggest reasons given
to support the combo ruling was

for entertainment in two places (the
dandy gym and the sweaty fraternity
house) when they can only physical-
ly be in one. Now I thought the IFC
had a pretty good solution to this
plan when it suggested that frater-
nities couldn’t compel a member to
pay for a combo if he was going to
the dance. It seems that the faculty
could have incorporated this sugges-
tion into their ruling, and have it
read something like this:

conflict with baser forms of enter-

ternal organizations;

“Whereas faculty

more than their fraternity counter-
parts;

“Whereas decline of said Univer-
sity functions would leave a void
in faculty social life;

“Whereas students are paying

ment;

“Be it resolved that students
cannot pay for entertainment until
said University functions are com-
pleted.

“Let it also be stated that this
resolution solves not only the finan-
cial problem of the more proverty-
stricken among the student body,
but it also—as a by-product of leg-
islation—guarantees the continuance
of a healthy form of social activity

for the faculty.”
This sort of logic justifies “the
Hill’s” action of several weeks ago,

and I think no one ean argue against
it. It also provides the basis for some
action which I think should be taken
in the future, hopefully soon. At
least as soon as an investigation war-
rants it.

I'm speaking, of course, of the
disparity of fraternity house meals
with the likes of some members.
For example, my particular frater-
nity sometimes serves fish on Fri-
days.

 

members en-.. |

Now there’s no real reason for this,
but it’s always been done so I don’t
feel I have the right to question it
But I do feel that the faculty could
come in and rule that everyone who
doesn’t like fish on Fridays only has
to pay for peanut-butter and jelly.

That way I get what I want for
lunch, I don’t have to pay for what
I don’t want, and the faculty can
point with pride to another decisive
action which alleviates another one
of those situations termed by Dean
Atwood last Friday as “unhealthy
for the general interest of the stu-
dent body.”

In closing I want to make it again
| clear that I applaud the faculty ac-
tion as another milestone in Uni-
versity policy. I look forward to the
day when the coat-of-arms will be
required on blue blazers (like in
prep school), instead of being just
optional equipment to be adopted on
the whim of the individual.

In this way the school will be
making another “bold step forward.”

Another amendment would re-

resentative with an additional junior
class representative. A similar pro-
posal failed by only one vote of
being included in the EC’s proposed
constitution. Both parties have al-
ready come out in favor of such
an amendment.

A third amendment, sponsored by
Sigma Delta Chi, professional jour-
nalism fraternity, and the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, would
require the EC to open all meetings
to the “recognized campus press,”
except where the committee decided
by a majority veto to go into ex-
ecutive session, thereby excluding
reporters. This amendment is also
backed in the University Party plat-
form.

Student Body Secretary Steve
Suttle asked the student body today
o “please read the amendments and
be familiar with them_”

A further issue was brought up
about re-emphasizing the program
of freshmen assimilation into the
university. The two parties both
favor a more concentrated effort
among upperclassmen to impress on
incoming classes the importance of
assuming our traditional regulations
and conventions that are currently
suffering from lack of support.

Club will present its last on-campus
concert of the year Wednesday at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

from original compositions to popu-
lar show music and ballads, the
Glee Club and the John A. Graham
Brass Choir will join their efforts
under the direction of Mr. Robert
Stewart.

John Baker, baritone, will be the
featured soloist. Baker, an SAE
sophomore from Suffolk, Virginia,
also sings with the Sazeracs.

The Glee Club has added several
new selections to its program for
this concert. Among these are: “Con-
ceited,” a burlesque featuring a vo-
cal quartet with the Glee Club;
“Echo Song,” an antiphonal compo-
sition by di Lasso; and a new ar-
rangement of “Tom Dooley.”

Sam Channel, Phi Kap junior, will
be soloist in another new song, the

 

folk song, “Turtle Dove.” John
Baker will sing the solo part in
“Black is the Color of My True
Love’s Hair,”another folk song.

The Brass Choir will perform two

compositions written by Mr Stew-
art especially for the group: “Con-
zona” and “Divertissement.” The

group will also perform two marches

of the American Revolution, “On the
Banks of the Swale” and “Shellpott
Hill.” Other selections are “Conzona,

ROBIN KELL SETS NEW SCHOOL RECORD

 

Trackmen Trounce Monarchs For Third Win

team defeated William and Mary at
Norfolk by a score of 82-58 here
Saturday.

New Record

Robin Kell set a new school record

42’ 5” effort. Kell also placed first
in the high jump and third in high
and lew hurdles.

The Generals swept the hundred
with Jim Hickey, Chris Kell and

Henry Sackett finishing one,

Drag Racing
New Sport
For Students

Drag racing, a motor sport which
has been sweeping the nation in the
past ten years, has now hit the
Washington and Lee campus.

There are, at the moment, sev-
eral W&L representatives on the
drag strips around this area. Roa-
noke has been the popular strip,
but the lack of traction and poor
organization has turned our com-
petitors to other tracks.

Nick Smith, with his 390 h.p., 406
cubic inch Ford Galaxie, brought
back from Concord, North Carolina,
his first trophy of the season in A
stock competition. His winning time
was 101:12 m.p.h. in 14 seconds fiat.

Kenny Beall, in his Sunbeam Al-
phine, won the sports car trophy
several weeks ago in Roanoke.

Since spring vacation a number
of new cars have appeared on
campus raising the prospective
number of drag racers for W&L.
Charles Stevenson has just ac-
quired a 360 h.p., fuel injection
Corvette with a four-speed gear-
box. Louis Mongeau has a 409
h.p. Chevrolet also with a four-
speed transmission,

Edge Jackson returned from spring
vacation with a 300 h.p. four speed
Corvette.

The Generals’ two victories came
in the number three and number six
singles positions. Freshman Jim de
Young, playing in the number three
slot defeated Jerry Ruddy of George
Washington, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5. Another
freshman, Lindsey Short, playing
number six, defeated Dick Cunning-
ham of the Colonials, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.

Baker Loses

Captain John Baker lost to Buddy
Geltz, 6-4, 6-1, in the first singles
match. Playing number two Randy
Jones lost a close match to Harvey
Harrison, 6-3, 6-1, while Jim Mell,
playing number four, lost 6-2, 6-3, to
Steve Kahn. In one of the closest
matches of the afternoon GW’s Allan
Green triumphed over Sophomore
Bud Hollman in the number five
singles match, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.

Although the Colonials swept
three doubles matches, two of

them were extremely close. After
winning the first set of the sec-
ond doubles match 6-3, freshmen
de Young and Short dropped the
next two, 6-1, 6-2, to Harrison and
Rudy of George Washington.

In the number three doubles Mell
and Hollman won the first set 6-3,
only to lose the next two by identi-
cal 6-4 scores to GW’s Kahn and
Cunningham. Goeltz and Green de-
feated Baker and Jones, 6-1, 6-2, to
round out the Colonials’ victory.

Macon Next

The Generals have two matches
this week. On Thursday they meet
Randolph-Macon in an away match,
while Friday they journey to Wil-
liamsburg to play William and Mary.

CRAM COURSE NO. 4: BATHYMETRY

Continuing our series of pre-final exam eram courses, today we

take up bathymetry —the study of ocean depths.

Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course on most
campuses, And small wonder. In the whole world there is only
one bathyscape, and only two people can get into it.

Nevertheless, the study of ocean depths is of great impor-
tance. Why, do you realize that the ocean is by far the world’s
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only fishes live in it.

And small wonder. Who'd want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Pacifie put to-
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Marlboro’s fine
mellow flavor, Marlboro’s clean white filter, Marlboro’s flip-top
box that really flips, Marlboro’s soft pack that’s really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Me, I will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share with a tympanist.

But I digress. Back to the oceans. The largest, as we know,
is the Pacific, which was discovered by Balboa, a Spaniard of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa’s vision, he first
saw the Pacifie while standing on a peak in Darien, which is
in Connecticut.

Even more astounding, when Balboa reached San Franciseo,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiians and
shouted, “Great little ocean you got here, kids!’ The Hawaiians,
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, declared a half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery fire over which they
prepared several gallons of poi, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.

 

pupa

hod wat b lie the?

But I digress.
the deepest. The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures

The Pacific, I say, is the largest ocean and also
more than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathoms—lengths of
six feet—after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measurer
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-first birthday,
was given a string six feet long with which he used to go
scampering all over England measuring sea water until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for measuring seems to have
run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all
his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London Sehool of
Economics.)

But I digress. Let us, as the poet Masefield said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers.) Who does not remember
Tennyson’s ‘Break, break, break’? Or Byron's “Roll on, thou
dark and deep blue ocean, roll’’? Or the many hearty sea chanties
that have enriched our folk music—songs like “Sailing Through
Kansas” and “Tl Swab Your Deck If You’ll Swab Mine” and
“The Artificial Respiration Polka.’’ My own favorite sea chanty
goes like this:

A girl loved a sailor and he did jilt her,

And she did weep and roar-ho!

Until she found a pe rfect filter,

Varlboro!

Sing hey, sing ho, sing ring-a-ding-ding,

And a perfect smoke

Sing tars and spars and patches,
Sing pack and box and lots to like,
And don’t forq t the matches!

I can to do something for Washing-

Bill Boardman noted the fact that
the office of Vice President was a re-
sponsible and full-time one. He felt
that previous experience was de-
sirable but not necessary.

Bob Payne mentioned the fact
that in the present period of tran-
sition, a responsible leader is need-
ed for president. He said, “I have the
guts to take a stand for students’
rights.”

Proud of his six year association
with Washington and Lee, Ireland
felt his strong personal desire to
lead the university and its student
government would be a great asset
to him in performing the job of
president.

When asked for a general com-
ment about the campaign and elec-
tion, Payne said, “A vote for the In-
dependent Party is a vote for re-
sponsible and responsive govern-
ment. I feel it is the duty of each
student to consider with the greatest
sobriety the issues, candidates, and
election in general. I ask for their
support next Thursday.

Said Ireland, “I implore the stu-
dent body to take into considera-
tion the seriousness of the offices
for which they are casting their
votes. The responsibility is a great
one, but the broader platform which
the University Party offers is the
best, the only one for Washington
and Lee.”

SIPA This Year

To Feature

Hal Foster And James Reston

A two-day event aimed at improving scholastic publishing
gets underway here this Friday with the opening of the 33rd
annual Southern Interscholastic Press Association convention.

Although early registration of
some 1,100 delegates begins Thurs-
day afternoon, the crowded SIPA
agenda does not call for any work-
ing sessions until Friday morning.

James B. Reston, columnist and
head of the Washington Bureau
of The New York Times, and car-
toonist Harold R. Foster, creator
of “Prince Valiant” for King fea-
tures Syndicate, are featured
speakers for the convention.

Delegates and faculty advisors at
the convention will represent some
178 preparatory and high schools
from 10 Southern States and the
District of Columbia.

Entries in the annual awards com-
petition this year total 305. High-
light of the convention will be an
awards luncheon Saturday in Wash-
ington and Lee’s Doremus Gymna-
sium where 17 SIPA trophies in var-
ious categories of magazine, news-
paper, yearbook and radio work will
be given. Several trophies also will
be awarded.

The convention features short
courses in all aspects of secondary
school publishing along with work-
shops, criticism sessions, panel and
roundtable discussions and lectures
covering general publications topics.

Reston, who joined The New York
Times in its London Bureau in 1939,
will speak at 12:05 p.m. Friday in
Doremus Gymnasium. He will dis-
cuss “Kennedy’s Second Year” in a
public address. Returning to the
United States in 1941, Reston was
made assistant to New York Times
publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger in
1943, and later that year returned
to London as acting head of The
Times Bureau. In January, 1945, he
became national correspondent and

New Elections

For Collegian

Publications Board President
Ned Ames announced today that
there will be new elections for the
post of Editor of the 1962-63
Southern Collegian.

They will be held at 2:30 Thurs-
day afternoon in the Student
Union. They will be open to any
member of the student body who
falls within the eligibility rules.

This election is necessitated by
the disqualification of Bill Bowen

 

because of failure to fulfill the
academic requirements for this
position.

Notices

Applications are now being re-
ceived for the position of Vice Pres-
ident and Assistant Business Man-
ager of the Washington and Lee
Dance Board.

Applicants should apply in writing
to Frank Young, Box 438, Lexington,
Va., listing their qualifications and
proposals for the improvement of
Dance Board Programs. They will be
interviewed Monday, April 30, at 2:00
in the Student Union building. Writ-
ten applications should be received

their Student Proposed Constitution
is beyond any realization of practi-
cality.

For instances, they advocate a
student senate. The thing just won’t
work—it would be too unwieldly and
cumbersome due to the very size of
the thing, the personnel it would
probably attract would be of dubious
merit and qualification, and it would
be a dangerous instrument to our
traditions.

 

Glee Club To Sing

(Continued from page 2)
will present a concert at Hood Col-
lege, Frederick, Maryland. In addi-
tion to its regular concert selections,
the Club will combine with the
Hood College Glee Club for two
selections, the “Hallelujah Chorus”
and “The Heavens Are Telling.”

On Saturday, May 5, at Mary
Baldwin College, the Glee Club will
combine with the Mary Baldwin
Glee Club to stage Kurt Weill’s
“Down in the Valley.” Parts of the
score of the one act opera are based
on the American folk songs, “Down
in the Valley,’ “The Lonesome
Dove,” “The Little Black Train,”
“Hop Up, My Ladies,’ and Sour-
wood Mountain.”

Leading male roles will feature
John Baker as Brack Weaver, Phil
Booth as the Leader and Preacher,
and Scott Iacone as the Father.

It was brought out in the “con-
stitutional convention of last week
(there were at least 15 people
there) that a Student Senate had
been initiated at a Northern school
not so many years ago. One of its
first acts was to rescind their equi-
valent of the EC decision on a
point of honor. In a matter of two
years they had only the ruins of
an effective honor system left to
admire.

On that grounds alone the Student
Proposed Constitution is worthy of
a vote of no confidence Thursday.

 

W&L Starts Drag Racing

(Continued from page 3)

Richard Moseby may well have
one of the fastest B stock Chevlorets
around the Lexington and Lynch-
burg area. His 350 h.p. three-speed
Chevrolet has broken the 15 second
mark more than once in the quarter
mile competition.

Sunday, April 29, the Lynchburg

A large turnout should be present.

Charlie Gummey, Steve Stull,
Johnny McDaniel, and Randy Woot-
ton scored for the Generals. W&L
goalie Ray Miller was credited with
25 saves against the Hopkins attack.
All told, the Jays took 68 shots at
the Generals’ goal. W&L shot 16
times.

“I thought the boys gave as good
an effort as they could have,” Mc-
Henry said. “If we'd played this
we'd have beaten Loyola, Brown,
and Hofstra.”

The team plays Saturday, against
the University of North Carolina.
“We plan to beat them,” McHenry
predicted. The only thing the coach
knows about the Tarheels is that
they beat Duke earlier in the sea-
son.
