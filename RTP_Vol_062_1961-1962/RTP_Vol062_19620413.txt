Bowers Speaks
On Soliloquy

Dr. Fredson T. Bowers told a
Washington and Lee University au-
dience yesterday that playwright
“William Shakespeare knew his au-
dience and how to take care of their
various points of view and reactions.”

In a discussion of the “Shape of
Hamlet,” the head of the English
department of the University of
Virginia analyzed a 12-line solilo-
quy from Act Three, Scene Two of
the famous Shakespearean play.
He said that Shakespeare used this
short speech to direct audience re-
action in the following climatic
scenes.

Although seemingly an unpromis-
ing speech, it sums up Hamlet’s res-
olution, while showing his cautious
plan of procedure as he deals with*
his mother, the wife of the brother
and murderer of Hamlet’s father.

Shakespeare, Bowers said, stepped
out of normal dramatic usage in the
speech as he frankly and openly di-
rected audience reaction. This indi-
cates the great importance of the
12 lines, and the fact that the author
meant them to forecast much of
the coming action.

In the soliloquy Hamlet reveals
the attitudes that lead him to suc-

 

Dr. Bowers

cessful revenge while taking his own
life. Bowers said that Hamlet’s two
tasks, to cause his mother to repent
of her incest, and to repay the
murderer of his father, were carried
out successfully. He called the for-
mer of the tasks the one which had
to be done first.

Dr. Bowers, widely known for his
work in the field of bibliography,
was the guest speaker in Lee Chapel
for the traditional Washington and
Lee Phi Beta Kappa convocation.
Fourteen students and an alumnus
were tapped for membership in the
Gamma of Virginia chapter of the
national honorary scholastic society
in ceremonies later Thursday. The
annual convocation also marked the
166th anniversary of George Wash-
ington’s $50,000 gift to the univer-
sity’s endowment.

14th Annual Tucker Lectures
Orison Marden Will Deliver

The president of the Association
of the Bar of the City of New York
will deliver the 14th annual John
Randolph Tucker Lectures in Law at
Washington and Lee University on
May 4 and 5.

Orison S. Marden, a member of
the law firm of White & Case, will
speak at 8 p.m. Friday (May 4) and
12 noon Saturday (May 5) in the
university’s Lee Chapel, according to
Law School Dean Charles P. Light,
Jr. No title has been listed for the
lectures.

The public lectures will coincide
with Washington and Lee’s alumni
reunion program for the classes of
1912, 1922, 1937 and 1952. Both law
and academic graduates are expected
to attend the lectures along with
non-alumni attorneys and law stu-
dents from other institutions. Large

Glee Club Gets

Music Room

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
has finally found a home in a new
music activity room in the basement
of the Student Union.

The Glee Club, which will share
the new room with the John A.
Graham Brass Choir and various
student combos and music groups,
held its first rehearsal in “its own”
room last night.

 

The new room is equipped with
a sound absorbing ceiling, large bul-
letin board “baffles” which absorb
sound on the sides, and new curtains
which cover the back wall and win-
dows to capture the sound.

New permanent risers have been
added for seating the club during
rehearsal. There are large cabinets
for music and a special closet for
storing instruments.

 

numbers of the Washington and Lee
Law School Association also will be
present.

The Tucker Lectures were estab-
lished in 1949 as a part of Washing-
ton and Lee’s bicentennial celebra-
tion They honor the memory of John
Randolph Tucker’s service to the
university as dean of the Law
School. The late John W. Davis, an
alumnus, nationally known attorney
and the 1924 Democratic candidate
for President, delivered the first
Tucker Lectures.

Last year’s lecturer was Judge E.
Barrett Prettyman, circuit judge of
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.

Other judges, attorneys and edu-
cators who have participated in the
series are Judge Arthur T. Vander-
bilt, Judge John J. Parker, John
Lord O’Brian, Judge Joseph C. Hut-
cheson, Jr., Judge Harold R. Medina,
Dean Robert G. Storey, William T.
Grossett, Dean Frederick Deane
Goodwin Ribble, John J. McCloy,
Whitney N. Seymour and Ross L.
Malone.

Marden received his LL.B. degree
from New York University in 1929
and became a partner in White &
Case law firm in 1946. He has been
recognized for his work as chair-
man of the National Council on,
Legal Clinics, a project of the Na-|
tional Legal Aid and Defender As-
sociation in cooperation with the)
American Bar Association and the
Association of American Law
Schools.

Steel: Is John F. Kennedy Out Of Bounds.

By ROSEWELL PAGE

When USS. Steel announced its $6
per ton price hike and when six
of the twelve major steel producers
in the nation (the top twelve con-
trol over 65 per cent of the steel
market) the White House let it be
known through what the Wall Street
Journal has termed “an _ inspired
leak” that the president was “in-
furiated” and that he was having
the Justice Department “investi-
gate” the matter.

As the week progressed and other
steel companies followed the leader
other investigations were announced.
Representative Celler, chairman of
the House Judicial Committee an-
nounced an investigation, and in the
Senate Kefauver joined the pack in
declaring that his committee would
hold an additional hearing which
will simply be another in a series |
of such investigations that the steel |
industry has undergone since World |
War Il. And finally on Thursday |
the other Kennedy proclaimed that |
he is ordering a grand jury inves- |
tigation into the new round of steel |
price increases.

First of all, what are the objectives |

 

of these hearings? In an interview

with Dr. Charles Phillips of the
W&L economics department, we
learned that the previous investi-

gations of the steel industry by
legislative committees have been
fruitless. The committees have been
witch hunting in the steel industry
five times since World War II. (It is
interesting to note that each inves-
tigation cost the government thous-
ands, and that someone might make
the rediculous suggestion that Celler
and Kefauver hold a joint hearing).
In each case, they have gathered
reams of information, stirred public
opinion to a fever and then retired
from the field. Just what these two
legislative investigating committees
intend to prove is beyond the writers
comprehension.

Under the present anti-trust laws,
which Dr. Phillips suggests do not
appear to have been violated by
the steel price hike, the Justice De-
partment must prove collusion
among the major steel companies to
raise prices, beeause the price
leadership which U.S. Steel Corpor-
ation is alleged to have practiced has
never been considered illegal by the

 

courts. So we see that brother Bob
Kennedy also has his work cut out
for him.

In answer to our question concern-
ing the mixture of economic policy
and political pressure which the
present administration has employed
Dr. Phillips made the following
comment:

First, with reference to the sharp-
est stock price slump in the past
six months which informed sources
believe to be a direct result of the
steel price controversy, he noted
that the president’s action in this
case confirms businesses’ previous
suspicion thathe is anti-business.
He added that his implications that
some price controls may be needed
has not made the big investor happy.

When questioned as to whether or
not he foresaw any immediate action
with regard to price controls, Dr.
Phillips replied that he did not be-
lieve that the present Congress
would pass any “price control” bill
other than a price reporting bill
which would require that certain
large firms in certain highly con-
centrated industries report intended

 

price hikes thirty days in advance.

was the sun.

After two straight drizzly days, the sun peeked through
cloudy skies early this morning, making things seem almost

like Spring, even if the temperatures*
were unseasonally low.

But regardless of coolish thermom-
eter readings, damp grounds, and an
unnatural lack of party spirit evi-
dent during this post-vacation week,
nearly two thousand students and
dates were likely to shop up at the
Mayflower this afternoon for the
annual Spring cocktail party, given
this year by the Beta’s in honor of
dance set president Charlie McCord.

By the time the cocktail party
was over, spirits considerably higher,

 

 

and things were indeed more na-
tural around the university.

Wells, Bibb

This is an unusual week-end for
Washington and Lee; and most stu-
dents are approaching it with skepti-
cal outlooks.

For the first time in years, there
will be no dance, either formal or
informal, during the weekend.

Instead, dance board president
Steve Galef has substituted two folk
music concerts, one scheduled for
Friday and one Saturday night.

Tonight’s entertainment gets un-
derway at 8, when Meg Welles and
Leon Bibb hold a joint concert in
Doremus Gymnasium.

On Saturday, Dave Guard and his
Whiskeyhill Singers move into Do-
remus for another concert, also
scheduled from 8-10 p.m.

All three groups are making their
first college appearance in the South,
and large crowds are expected; es-
pecially since IFC rules prohibiting
house combo parties from beginning
until the end of the concert will be
in effect.

For this, the first folk music week-
end in W&L history, Galef has ar-
ranged special facilities in the gym,
including new walkout stages and
special staging effects.

weekend in W&L history, Galef has

Performers Praised

The excellence of Welles, Bibb,
and Guard as entertainers is widely
known. All three have new records
for major recording firms coming out
before summer, and are greatly in
demand by college booking agencies
throughout the United States.

A New York Times critic recently
called Miss Welles “the brightest
talent in folk music today, better
than Odetta or Joan Baez.” And the
San Francisco Chronicle called Bibb
“the most dynamic new performer in
entertainment.”

Guard, who was the brains of
the Kingston Trio for five years,
recently quit the Trio to form his
own group because he wanted to
do more authentic folk music. In
the process, he added a girl singer
and two of the foremost string in-
strumentalists in America, and called
them the Whiskeyhill Singers.

After only two months of regular
performances, the Whiskeyhill Sing-
ers have received widspread acclaim,
including a feature article in Life
magazine, which called them “per-
haps the best of all the folk singing

 

Dr. Phillips added that “the prob-
lem which President Kennedy faces
is not a new one. We have had con-
tinuous inflation since the end of
World War II and the Federal gov-
ernment has either been unwilling
or unable to balance the budget.
Thus, in order to try to control in-
flation the Executive has placed
pressure on certain industries to
keep prices down.”

“This mixed system of self deter-
mination for management and the
application of detailed political pres-
sure has not worked,” Phillips said.

“Tf the President can get manage-
ment and labor together before ne-
gotiations break down, fine! But
either management must make the
final decision concerning its price
policies or it must not.”

Phillips emphasized the point that
the time has come for the U.S. to
make a decision on exactly what
type of economic system it wants
and then to adopt the proper means
to achieve it.

“If we are to have an economic
system based on the principle of
workable competition,’ he — said,

“management must have the right to | adopt the means to achieve the final

 

make its own decisions.”

“Tf Blough is right in his conten-
tion that steel needs the price hike
in order to revitalize and modernize
the industry to compete with foreign
producers, the president is wrong;
and if Blough bows to the President’s
will, who is to suffer? Certainly not
the president: rather, it would be
the American economy in general
and the steel industry in particular.

“The problem with Presidential
threats and pleadings,” Phillips said,
“is that they deal with the ends
and not the means.”

“Tf we really want to control infla-
tion, then we ought to be willing to
take measures to control inflation.”
(Le., proper monetary and _ fiscal
policy).

He said that if we feel big business
is too big, we ought to take steps to
break up the big firms in the highly
concentrated industries; or if labor
unions are so powerful that they are
a threat to our competitive economic
system, then we ought to deal with |
them directly. His point is, and we|
believe it is a good one, that we
must decide on what we want and

 

duos, trios, or quartets.”

result and discontinue a sufficient-
unto-the-day, hit and miss policy
with regard to unions, business, and
our economic system in general.

Dr. Phillips would make no com-
ment on whether or not the Blough
defense of the steel price hike was
justified, although he doubted that
the price increase would be of sub-
stantial worth in increasing the in-
dustry’s profits, emphasizing that
it was Blough’s decision to make.

In general, we feel that Mr. Ken-
nedy’s implication that the price rise
is an act lese majestic, a crime of
insubordination against the sovereign,
in short, the refusal of the indispen-
sable segment of our free economy to
live up to his own ideas and ex-
pectations of how the steel industry
ought to be organized, is an an un-
fortunate one and we agree with
the editor of the Wall Street Jour-
nal when he says:

“What ought to infuriate the coun-
try is their attempt to pillory one
private company for the consequence
of past public power. And this ar-
rogant idea that the price of steel,
or any other commodity, ought to
be what the President says it is.”

Kennedy Versus Steel Industry

Student Body President Uncas McThenia’s letter to the
editor, which is published below, should prove one of the earlier
shots in what promises to be a hot national debate over the
relationship between Mr. Kennedy’s government and the steel

industry.

Liberal comments have ranged from violent rage to delight
at a chance to crack down on Big Business. Conservatives have
deep fears that excessive Executive and Congressional reaction
to the price raise in steel will push this country farther toward
socialism. One W&L professor said this “may well mean the
beginning of the end for capitalism.”

The Ring-tum Phi will take an active interest in the debate,

for we believe that it will be one of great importance for the
future of this country. To clear up the issues, a panel discus-
sion, under Ring-tum Phi sponsorship is tentatively scheduled
for next Thursday. Professors Phillips and Gunn of the eco-
nomics department have consented to participate in the panel.
Other panelists will be named later.

Changes In The Constitution

The Executive Committee will submit their draft of a new
student government constitution to the student body next week.
The principal changes deal with the method of nominating
candidates for student body offices and with the heads of the
dance sets. They have already been adequately covered in the
Ring-tum Phi. We said before that we favored the changes that
the EC will propose. They represent, in our minds, substantial
improvements over the present system.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor ...

 

 

Northern Doctor Defends
Social Structure of South

March 22, 1961
To the Editor:

Mr. Jack Atwell (R-T P, March
13) perhaps is unaware that the
Soviets have been posing for a long
time as fighters against bias and
discrimination, but the record stands
against them. Z. Dobbs’ Red Intrigue
and Race Turmoil is available for
study, reflection and argumentation.
Occasionally, even newspapers print
accounts of the biased treatment of
Negroes in the U.S.S.R. (I am not
referring to the propaganda red
carpet treatment given to Robeson,
ete.). Mention of the Soviet treat-
ment of minorities (e.g. Hungarians)
should disarm any opponent. (I will
omit mention of other episodes.)

Lately we are beginning to hear
more of anti-semitism in Russia. To
obtain information, one might well
start with Karl Marx’s A World
Without Jews. A more scholarly
presentation is Edmund Silberner’s
The Anti-Semitic Tradition in Mod-
ern Socialism (Hebrew U., Jerusa-
lem, 1956).

With regard to the “Freedom
Riders,” one might glance at the
Congressional Record of May 25,
1961, wherein some of the associa-
tions of several directors of C.O.R.E.
are described. I particularly draw
attention to pages 8351 to 8362,
wherein are described the individual
directors’ associations. These find-
ings have been published in some
newspapers (not in the North—to
my knowledge) and in Human
Events.

I am truly sorry to read that a
graduate of W&L considers the
South “so backward and its intel-
lectuals so passive.” This would
seem to reveal a lack of knowledge
of the South’s role in American lit-
erature and its many contributions
to the conservative political cause.
Even our own Chicago Tribune has
the greatest respect and admiration

 

for men like Senators Byrd, Mc-
Clellan, Thurmond (just to mention

| three).

With regard to integration, an
awareness of the double standard
and the geographic segregation of
the North should caution us to be
wary of pointing the finger of guilt
at others.

Sincerely,

EDWARD PALMER, M.D.

Steel Action Is Labelled
‘Political Demogoguery’

To the Editor:

It has been a long time since
such political demogoguery as evi-
denced Wednesday at the presiden-
tial news conference has been ob-
served in the White House. The
New Frontier has not only taken
on the myriad responsibilities norm-
ally delegated to government, but
has also assumed the position of
opera director and majority stock-
holder of U.S. Steel.

Whether the announced price rise
in steel is advisable is a matter of
some debate. Whether it is justified
should be determined on the market
place.

Evidently the President would
make the steel industry his whipping
boy by saying that a small group
is administering prices in disregard
of 180 million Americans. If this is
true, is it so much worse than hav-
ing the President himself declare
what the price of steel should be.

It is apparent that Mr. Kennedy
has been caught in a political mouse-
trap. It was only last week that
Vice President Johnson extolled the
“new dimension” in collective bar-
gaining developed by the New Fron-
tier. This meddling “new dimension”
which runs the gamut from the
Metropolitan Opera to the steel in-
dustry has blown up in his face and
the President cannot enjoy the po-
litical advantage hoped for.

Washington and Lee is a school of
symbols. The colonnade, Lee Chapel,
“old George,” and Goshen are per-
haps most often mentioned and most
popular.

There’s another symbol, not as
old as the colonnade, but just as
representative in its own way of
student life at W&L—the combo.
For the most part, these are small
rock ’n’ roll bands—usually Negro—
who play professionally at colleges
up and down the Eastern Seaboard.

But now Washington and Lee has
its own combo. It’s called the Sabers,
and is made up of six freshmen
with a yen and a talent for making
good popular music.

chance. Towards the end of March,

them to play. Evidently the Sabers

The irony of objective education
is that it creates a questioning frame
of mind which often promotes criti-
cism of the very system that has
produced it. This is a classic ex-
ample of “biting the hand that feeds
you.” Anyone who has _ benefited
from an objective education will in-
variably turn to questioning the
goals and methods of the system of
education within which he labors. It
is essential, therefore, for educators
to publish good solid arguments why
certain educational practices are fol-
lowed, and to state what goals they
seek to reach.

For this reason, it is strange that
no attempt has been made to defend
or apologize for an important fea-
ture of our system of education:
namely, the major requirement. Has
anyone ever heard a really valid
case made for the contention that

At press time, the Sabers have

They will play May 11 at St. Anne’s,

Most of the members of the Sabers
are combo veterans. Brownell sang

bo experience. McCord, who is the

has played in combos for a couple

Is The ‘Major’ Re

Or perhaps it is unfair to ask such
a question; perhaps no such argu-
ment exists.

It is more than likely that this is
so. Although the major is no doubt
a necessary and desirable guide for
a certain number of students, it is
neither necessary nor desirable for
all. Pre-medical students, for ex-
ample, by the very nature of the
profession which they intend to en-
ter, need to have concentrated and
specialized preparation. But what
kind of special preparation can you
give a pre-law undergraduate?

The mistake, obviously, has been
in assuming that what is good for
the pre-med student is good for the
pre-law student, and what is good
for the student who plans to go on
for a masters and doctorate is good
for the student who is taking over
his father’s business or going into
the army. The trend to specialization
has become an obession, and where

 

 

Professors & Students
Form History Seminar

By BILL ATWELL

This semester, following a type
of program initiated at Washington
and Lee last year, four professors
of history and various history honor
students have been conducting sem-
inars in their chosen field.

The basic purpose of the seminars
according to Dr. Thomas P. Hughes,
is to enable professors and students
to exchange ideas and _ opinions
which might not be done as effec-
tively in other ways.

The history seminar itself de-
veloped out of a practice begun late
in the 19th Century at some of the
finer German universities. One such
institution was the University of
Berlin. The usual procedure was for
professors and graduate students to
meet and discuss the latest historical
books and novels. These seminars
produced some of the greatest teach-
ers of history in that time.

Interpretations of History

There are two basic differences
between the seminars at Washington
and Lee and the older ones. First,
the seminars here are carried on
with undergraduates participating
and, also, the discussions here deal
with older material rather than with
current developments.

Dr. Hughes said that instead of
dealing merely with events in his-
tory, the seminars are concerned
with the men who write history and
the interpretations of these men.
The types of interpretations to be
discussed include “great man” in-
terpretations, economic interpreta-
tions, the more recent psychological
interpretations, and those with so-
ciological emphasis.”

Dr. Hughes added that “in doing
this we realize the historian is not
simply a recorder of facts but is a
person truly engaged in creative
work.”

The people who have taken part in
the two seminars held thus far, aside
from Dr. Hughes, are Dr. C. O.
Smith, Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh, Mr.
R. W. Kenney, and seniors Bond
Johnson and Jack Vardamann.

The format of the seminar is
simple. An honors student opens
with a brief summary of the view-

ington and Lee has announced that

points of one or two leading his-
torians. The student then leads the
discussion in which everyone has a
chance to comment or ask questions.
In one seminar a professor empha-
sized a_ political interpretation
while another was working along the
idea of sociological interpretation.

Food for Thought

A student asked if personal pre-
judice might not have a great deal to
do with how a historian arrives at
his particular interpretation. A dis-
cussion then followed of the ways
in which different environments
might effect every historian.

Obviously, there was considerable
food for thought at this seminar and
according to Dr. Hughes, this has
been true both last year and so far
this year.

“The faculty,” said Hughes, “finds
it interesting to find out the student’s
point of view. We are anxious
to know what the student is looking
for in history and why he is study-
ing it. Sometimes we like to com-
pare his ideas with our own. This
keeps the faculty informed and also
enables the student to learn more
about his teachers and why they are
history teachers.”

This program, it seems to me, can
prove vastly beneficial to the intel-
lectual complexion of the school.
Both the teachers and students in-
volved should be commended for
taking part in a new realm of en-
deavor. Let’s hope that such activi-
ties will continue and perhaps arise
in other courses in the University.

uirement Needed?

there is no reason for it—better still,
where there is outright harm in it—
it is nonetheless maintained.

Up With Whole Men

As Joseph Krutch has said: “Our
modern society requires specialists;
but what it desperately needs is
whole men and women. Down with
the splendid splinter, up with the
whole man.”

What is the reason for our pres-
ence at college? Some of us, no
doubt, are simply marking time, or
else having a good time. But there
are those who take seriously the
opportunity which has been pre-
sented to them. Anyone who does
take this opportunity seriously hopes
that, in the broadest sense, his edu-
cation will make a better man of
him. And the best kind of man that
can be conceived is the whole man,
not the “splendid splinter.”

It is impossible to learn all that
there is to know. It is almost equally

 

impossible to learn all there is to
know about even one field of
knowledge in a short four-year span.
What can be done in four years is
to acquire an introductory know-
ledge of as wide a range of sub-
jects; for it is absurd to assert that
one subject is more valuable than
another and should be concentrated
upon exclusively. No subject is so
worthy, except as it contributes to
the improvement of the individual as
a whole man.

This beginning can be made in
college, and one thing besides: that
is, the promotion of a critical and
objective frame of mind, and the
inculeation of a passionate involve-
ment in education as the key to
becoming a better man. These ob-
jectives, and the ultimate value to
which they all point, soar beyond
and deny the concept of the major
requirement. What then can be of-
fered in its defense?

Alsace Is Now A Well-Integrated Part Of The French Nation

By AL BRODDUS

Strasburg, Mar. 22—No other re-
gion of the world has changed
character any more often than Al-
sace, excepting Lorraine. According
to the current status quo Alsace is
in France, bordered immediately to
the north and east by the German
Federal Republic, to the South by
Switzerland, and to the northwest
by an equally French Lorraine. This
is the region which has brought hav-
oe to elementary history courses for
years. When Bismark attacked the
French in 1870 Alsace became Prus-
sian. She was returned to the French
after the First World War, only to
be incorporated in the Third Riech
two decades later. In 1945 she was
returned to her present position.

There is a touch of irony in all
these alterations, since the Alsatians
themselves, left entirely alone, would
probably lead a happy autonomous

 

existence. This has been impossible
due to the attitude of the French
and Germans, and would probably
not be altogether practical because of
size. Thus the oscillation.

Ethnic Characteristics

What is particularly interesting is
the ethnic result of this singular
history. For the Alsatian is a distinct
ethnic entity. This is particularly
true presently. For while the Al-
satian is a cultural and linguistic
derivative of the German race, at
this moment the distinction between
the two is fairly clear. This is
the result of 17 years of French in-
fluence, the reintroduction of the
beret and the French language. At
times, Alsatians give the objective
observer the impression he is at a
large masquerade party in Munich
of which the theme is “France.”

What makes it necessary to dis-
tinguish the Alsatian from the Ger-

mans are the very obvious similari-
ties between the two, resulting from
the fundamental fact that the Al-
satian, as regards his origins, is
German, He has retained a number
of his Germanic traits, notably his
native German dialect and his in-
satiable desire for order and clean-
liness. (Alsatian landladies are no-
torious for this.)

His mentality is in no way Latin.
His physical characteristics resem-
ble those of the other Southern
Germanic peoples as the Bavarian.
But it is not a mistake to say that,
culturally, the Alsatian resembles
his counterpart across the Rhine less
at present. But this is not as much
the result of an extensive rapproche-
ment with the French, as with the
public character life in the Federal
Republic has taken: intensive mod-
ernization, etc., to a much greater

 

extent than is the case in Alsace.

 

French Influence
As has been said, under no cir-
cumstances should one exaggerate
the influence of French rule for
the better part of 40 years since
the first World War, particularly on
a social and cultural level. Having
been in Strasbourg during the past
five months, I have had the occa-
sion to hear one Alsatian woman
complain about characteristics of
women of the French interior, one

of whom her son married.

However, it is clear that political-
ly Alsace is a well-integrated part of
the French nation. It must be re-
membered that all Alsatians born
after, say 1915, (which includes all
under 45 years of age) have known
only five years or so of German
rule under Hitler. These genera-
tions have known French as a native
language and have _ accustomed
themselves to the French adminis-

 

trative system. Most recently they
have become involved in the Al-
gerian War along with the rest of
the nation, and their building have
received the paint jobs from the
OAS, which are at this moment as
characteristic of France as perfume.

In any case, the result of these
influences is the contemporary Al-
satian, to the description of whose
character must be added his provin-
cial traits. His capital is Strasbourg
(which has previously been called
Strassburgg, but which is now Stras-
booor), and this city is itself a
manifestation of the mixture which
has made him distinct. The city,
whose origins have been traced as
far back as 800 B.C. when it was
apparently a fishing center on the
Rhine, is symbolized by its magnifi-
cent cathedral (the single spire was
completed in 1439) which has been
called the “boldest achievement of

 

cathedral architecture.” At _ this
moment, the city, like its people, is
characterized by a dual nature. (Rue
Goethe, for example.)

A European Capital

What is distinguishing this region
and its capital further, presently, is
the centering of at least a part of
the current European movement
here. The Council of Europe (16
member states) occupies a large
building in Strasbourg, where the
sessions of the Parliamentary As-
sembly (the legislative body of the
Common Market) are held as well.
Despite competition from Luxem-
bourg and Brussels, Strasbourg has
a strong claim to become the capi-
tal of a new “Europe.”

And in this case one hopes this
fine old city, in becoming such, will,
along with the whole of Alsace, as-
sume some new characteristics which
will be permanent.

LX Team Plays Washington Tomorrow
Baseball Team Drops Four Out Of Stee Games

Coach Needs Football Players
For Winless Lacrosse Squad

W&M, U. Richmond Here Next Week!

Washington and Lee’s varsity baseball team hopes to get
back on the winning track next week after a disappointing
Southern trip over Spring recess in which they dropped three

out of four practice games
encounter.

Games with Lynchburg College
and Bridgewater were rained out
this week, but the Generals are
scheduled to play William and Mary
here on Tuesday and Richmond on
Wednesday.

The big problem over Spring re-
cess was lack of pitching. Lyles has
only four pitchers on whom he can
depend, and two of them are fresh-
men,

Senior righthander Phil Sharp
should be the mainstay of the pitch-
ing staff but hasn’t been up to par
so far this year. Sophomore leftie
Gamber will help out if he can get
rid of a bad case of early-season
wildness. Mason McGowin and Louis
Paterno, the freshmen, need more
experience, but Lyles said he was
fairly pleased with their showings
so far.

Batters Are Fair

The hitting was better than the
pitching over the recess, but still
leaves quite a bit to be desired.
Captain Ned Hobbs, the shortstop,
led the team in batting in the five
games last week, going 7-for-16.
Rightfielder Buck Rose was also hit-
ting the ball well, getting six hits
in 17 at-bats. Robin Wood and Bob-
by Williams were both 5-for-18.

Third baseman Chuck Lane’s hit-
ting has been a bit of a disappoint-
ment this year and Lyles has moved
him to the number seven spot in
the batting order, hoping for better
results from Lane.

In the field, Lyles says that the
double play combination of Ned
Hobbs at short and Park Gilmore at
second base has looked very good.
Gilmore has been getting the ball
away on the pivot a lot faster this
year than he had before.

Lyles says that he still has plenty
of problems, though. He needs a

and one regularly-scheduled

good-hitting first baseman and an-
other catcher to spell Jim Russ. Ash-
ley Allen was to have been second
catcher, but had to have four stitches
when his finger was split against
South Carolina last week. He’ll be
out of action at least another week.

Conditioning Poor

Lyles is also worried about the
team’s condition. Bad weather had
hampered practices before the
Southern swing and nearly every-
one on the squad was complaining of
a sore arm when the Generals start-
ed playing every day. Lyles gave
them as much exercise as he could
this week, but the weather has
kept them indoors too much.

The Spring trip was a study in
frustration. The Generals got good
hitting and pitching on occasion, but
got the two of them together in only
one game, their 14-3 conquest of
Atlantic Christian College.

After they were rained out of a
March 31 game with Elon College,
the ball players moved on to an
April 2 game with South Carolina at
Columbia. Phil Sharp turned in
what Coach Lyles called “a very
good job,” against the Gamecocks,
allowing eight hits and throwing only
83 balls in an eight-inning stint. But
South Carolina’s Bill Coleman turn-
ed in an even better job and the
Generals got only two hits and lost,
3-1.

The Generals’ hitting improved the
next day against Newberry College
but freshman pitcher Mason Mc-

 

Gowin, the W&L starter, gave out
too many walks in the five innings
he pitched and the Generals came
out on the short end of a 7-10 score
when reliefer Louis Paterno gave
up three runs in the eighth inning
to the Tigers. Lyles said, though,
that McGowin and Paterno “did fair-
ly well for freshmen.” Ned Hobbs
led the General hitting, going three-
for-four and hitting a 455-foot hom-
er.

It was almost the same story the
next day, as W&L returned to Co-
lumbia for another game with South
Carolina, a 6-10 loss. Sophomore
lefthander Brice Gamber started the
game for the Generals, but ran into
control trouble and gave up nine
runs before Paterno relieved him in
the fifth inning. But Paterno turned
in a fine relief game, giving up only
one run in the remaining three in-
nings. The only W&L win on the
trip came on April 4 against At-
lantic Christian College. The Gen-
erals got 14 hits against two ACC
pitchers and McGowin, his curve ball
working well, scattered eight oppo-
sition hits to gain a 14-3 victory.

W&L’s lack of pitching depth
really showed up in an April 6 game
with small-college toughie East Car-
olina. Lyles had to send in Paterno,
who had worked three innings on
each of the two preceding days,
when Sharp was injured with one
out the second inning. Paterno got
out of that inning safely, but was
shelled for 7 runs in the third, 3 in
the fourth, and 3 in the fifth, as
the Carolinians carried off a 13-2
victory.

The next day’s game with Norfolk
William and Mary, for which Lyles
had been saving Gamber, was rained
out.

Coach Bob McHenry says he needs some more football
players on his lacrosse team. According to McHenry, his boys
have been really pushed around the last few weeks—‘what we
need is some boys who don’t mind body contact. Hofstra,
Penn State, Massachusetts, and Brown were big and rough.

They really intimidated some of our*

boys.”

McHenry is looking forward to to-
morrow’s game here with Washing-
ton College. Washington doesn’t have
a football team.

The stickmen, 0-6 for the season,
need to do more than just get
rougher. McHenry says they need
to be in better shape, need more
experience, and have to make a lot
fewer mistakes.

It’s a young team, and he hopes
they’ll get better, but admits that
he is disappointed with their down-
slide from a fine performance against
the visiting Australian team three
weeks ago. “It seems like we’ve got-
ten steadily worse and worse. I
think we hit rock bottom against
Penn State last Saturday.”

McHenry is looking for a close
game against Washington. The

 

 

Sho’man have a good attack, led
by Skip Rudolph, the second lead-
ing scorer last year in the nation.
Their close defense is also strong.
But they’re a young team, like
W&L. McHenry says we'll have to
win the game in the midfield if we
win it.

If comparative scores mean any-
thing the two teams have played one
common opponent this year. Loyola
beat W&L 10-6, and Washington 6-5.
The Loyola coach told McHenry
that he sees the two as about even
but if he had to pick a winner, he’d
pick Washington.

McHenry singled out three W&L
players for praise on their perform-
ance to date.

“Johnny McDaniel is the team’s
leading scorer and seems to be get-

Randy Wootton has been doing good

Ray Miller has been doing an
excellent job in the goal. He had
never played goal before this year,
but volunteered to shift there from
his attack spot. “That takes guts,”
said McHenry, “he’s been terrific.
He got 34 saves against Brown and
29 against Massachusetts.”

Injuries have slowed up three key
men on the team. Midfielder Bruce
Jackson has a bad charlie horse and

The injuries are a real blow to a
