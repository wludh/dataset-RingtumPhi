‘Protest’ Editors Quiz Executive

Two Students Present New Constitution

New Draft Features Senate;
Change In Honor System

By KEN

Associate Editor
The draft for a new Student Body Constitution has been

drawn up by junior Bill Lowry
Ben Brown.

The Constitution provides for a Student Senate which shall
be invested with the legislative powers of the Student Body.

The new Constitution, and the*
Student Senate, in particular, stand
as an attempt to combat student
apathy and draw greater interest
in student participation.

The Constitution specifies that
the Senate “Shall be composed of 30
elected representatives, six each to
be elected from the freshman, soph-
omore, junior, and senior academic
classes; and six to be elected from
the Law School.”

The Constitution further stipu-
ulates that at least one of the rep-
resentatives shall be elected from
the non-fraternity members of the
student body.

An Executive Committee is pro-
vided with judicial and executive
powers of the University.

The 12 members of the committee
will be composed of representatives
from each class, the three big Stu-
dent Body offices, and two mem-
bers elected at large.

The only radical change in the
procedure of the EC is the provision
granting that if a charge constitutes
a clear violation of the Honor Code,
the Committee shall determine
whether the case warrants expul-
sion for a year or permanent dis-
missal.

Uncas McThenia, President of the
Student Body, stated that there
were some aspects of the draft
which he endorsed and some that he
strongly disapproved of.

One provision he stated particu-
lar disapproval of was the one con-
cerning the power of the EC to
suspend a student as an alternative
for an Honor Violation.

The Student Senate serves as the
most distinctive feature of the Con-
stitution.

The legislative jurisdiction con-
cerns such powers as:

IFC To Work With Dance Board

By T. D. EDWARDS
Associate Editor

The Student Union was witness
last night to another long, and this
time, very controversial meeting of
the IFC. The topics of discussion
were Rush Week and _ fraternity
combos during dance week-ends.

Steve Galef, Dance Board presi-
dent, began an address to the IFC,
by thanking the fraternities for their
cooperation during the Fancy Dress
concert and for their planned co-
operation for the Spring concert.

He stated, however, that atten-
dance at the dance was still too
poor to justify the money being
spent.

Galef felt that the attempts by
the Dance Board Advisory Council
and Faculty Social Committee to
bring good entertainment and to
create student interest has resulted
in an improvement in dance at-
tendance.

However, the fraternity combos
are in direct conpetition with Uni-
versity - sponsored dances. Galef
asked for a compromise.

Bob Doenges, IFC president,
pointed out that the Faculty Com-
mittee on Fraternities and Faculty

Doenges responded by saying the
dance sets are functions of the Uni-
versity, which allows fraternity
combos, and now these combos have
begun to infringe on University en-
tertainment.

Many solutions were offered
which included an extension of Sat-
urday night combo hours to 3 a.m.,
pending faculty approval.

Also voiced was the idea to pro-
hibit any combos for the first two
hours of any University function.
This would allow unopposed con-
certs and partially unopposed danc-
es.

EC Kills Proposed Change

In Conventional Dress
By KEN LANE

Associate Editor
The Executive Committee last night voted down a motion
that Conventional Dress be dispensed with after 9:00 p.m.
The vote failed to carry by a six-to-six tie.
The faculty peition for the postponement of rush week was

 

“Our main concern,” Brown stat-
ed later in a personal interview, “is
to broaden the base of student gov-
ernment, to get more student in-
volvment in student affairs.”

The condition which he attacks is
the prevailing student apathy.

Brown maintained that one com-
bative would be a greater dissem-
ination of information on EC mea-
sures and reports.

Student Senate Needed

The Student Senate, besides pro-
viding greater student participa-
tion, would help meet this need,
Brown explained.

Brown and Lowry submitted be-
fore the EC a request that the Com-
mittee work in conjunction with
Protest on a survey of student views
on all reform matters.

Brown stressed the need for moti-
vating student interest in both cam-
pus activities and outside concerns.

Appealed to EC

He appealed to the EC to take
greater leadership in playing the
role.

His proposed Student Senate, he
stated, is an attempt to draw in
greater student participation by
placing the student body govern-
ment on a more democratic basis.

Brown further expressed a grie-
vance against the limited potential-
ity of the student in campus affairs.

He stated the desire that this
group be given greater representa-
tion in the various governing bodies.

Vote Next Week

The EC moved to refer the dis-
cussion of the constitution until
next week. The vote on the first
three sections of the recently re-
leased EC constitution will take
place next week.

 

2 Campus Buildings
Nearing Completion

A $2,000,000 construction
project involving two major
buildings on the Washington
and Lee University campus is

‘|nearly three-quarters done.

Only interior and trim work re-
main on a four-story dormitory for
freshmen, while the $1,400,000 sci-
ence facilities are nearly half com-
pleted, D. E. Brady, Washington
and Lee superintendent of buildings
and grounds, reports. Contractors
have promised the buildings for use
in September.

The installation of a new steam
boiler and other improvements to
the University’s existing heating
plant at a cost of more than $50,000
should be finished within two weeks,
Brady said.

Dorm Houses 91 Students

The new dormitory will house 91
students and will complete a three-
unit student housing center. Two
other buildings—Newton D. Baker
Dormitory for upperclassmen and
John W. Davis Dormitory for law
students—were opened in 1959.

Only 277 students can be accom-
modated in the regular freshman
dormitory, while the university’s
normal freshman enrollment as 320.

A special feature of the new
dormitory will be a 15-bed infirm-
ary.

Contract price for the building is
$326,545,

 

The largest project in Washing-
ton and Lee’s current expansion is
a four-story building for the de-
parments of physics and _ biology
plus a new wing and some remodel-
ing for the existing science build-
ing, Howe Hall.

Observatory for Physics

The University plans to provide
all four scientific departments with
modern instructional laboratories
and classrooms, library and display
areas, special facilities, including an
observatory for physics, a vivarium
and greenhouse for biology, a seis-
mology room for geology and an
instrumental analysis laboratory for
chemistry.

Contract price for this building
is $1,359,836.

Landscaping and other expenses
will boost the total cost of univer-
sity projects to the two million
mark,

Result of Two-Year Program

The science facilities are a di-
rect result of a two-year develop-
ment program in which Washington
and Lee sought funds from alumni,
parents and other friends.

The program—started in January,
1959—was designed to raise $2,000,-
000 for improving the university’s
facilities for science, journalism and
pre-engineering. The new building
will relieve crowded conditions in

the present Howe Hall, now housing

Re See

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist
A sagacious member of the
Washington and Lee faculty once
told a class, “Gentlemen, you live
in a monastery.” We laughted at
the time, but when the news of
the faculty petition broke and fra-
ternity men began speculating
about the consequences of it, the
point rushed home to me.

I still stand opposed to the cur-
rent petition, but on a second
thought and the suggestion of a
fraternity brother, I called on Dr.
Emmons Sunday. Although he
he seemed to be a man who had
answered the same question too
many times, I came away with a
better understanding of the situa-
tion.

Apparently this “segment” of
the faculty does not 1. want to de-
stroy the fraternity system, or 2.
want to abolish Help Week—al-
though this would be a welcomed
by-product of the reform. The real
objective of the petition is to re-
store a balance between social and
academic activities. Maybe I’m
dense, but that point did not em-
erge from the petition or the dis-
cussions of it.

Some of the faculty apparently
feels that the social side of W&L
life is over-emphasized while the
studies are given a less import-
ant place than they deserve. And

Faculty Wants To Restore Social, Academic Balance

proposed the much - debated
change—with the realization that
the IFC or other student groups
would not be willing to discuss
such a proposal.

Whether such an imbalance ex-
ists or not is a moot question.
From the faculty viewpoint it
does, from ours it probably does
not. However, the faculty has
forced our hand. If we could bear
to sit down and think it out, the
present system probably does need
some change; but not necessarily
the one which has been proposed.

The proposed alteration in the

system apparently stems from the
experience of certain faculty
members who witnessed such a
change when they were under-
graduates—without the loss of any
houses—altogether their system
was unquestionably different from
ours in several respects.

Dr. Emmons left me with the
impression that the group of the
faculty which backs the petition
wants some change, and though
this is the one they settled on,
they would be willing to accept
any constructive change which
would allow them to “get to the

Only True

freshmen first” for the sole pur-
pose of “motivating them in their
studies.”

Like most fraternity men, I like
the system as it is. However, if
some change in Rush and Help
Week could be worked out which
would be satisfactory to the fra-
ternities and still passify the more
demanding members of the fac-
ulty (who are usually the ones
from whom students learn the
most) then we will all be “better
off.”

Which puts us back where we
began. Unless we want the fac-

ulty and the administration to
force some alteration on us, how-
ever reluctant they may be, how-
ever distasteful it might be, the
students, in particular the fratern-
ity men, had better come up with
some compromise solution.

Dr. Emmons himself suggested
another change which seems more
palatable. The suggestion is to
have Rush Week at the end of the
freshman year, thus eliminating
the social pressure at the begin-
ning of the college career, Help
Week per se, but still allowing for
housing sophomores, as_ pledges,

EDITORIALLY SPEAKING

IFC Shouldn’t Act In Haste

The IFC, we are happy to report, last night named George
Honts as the chairman of the IFC Rush Week Committee, and
it is our hope that this committee will be able to come up with
a feasible solution to the faculty petition circulated last week.

We hope that the IFC committee will not act in haste, and
that their findings will be based on sound and mature judg-
ment.

It appears to the Tuesday Edition that the main item which
the faculty members who signed the petition want is the abol-

ishing of Hell Week.

It goes without saying that the proposed sophomore rush
system has its drawbacks. The drawbacks of such a system have
been aired, and it should appear obvious that such a system
would not offer any solution that would be accepted by the
IFC or by the fraternity members.

We hope that the IFC won’t act in haste, and that any solu-
tion that the IFC comes up with will be a solution palatable
to both sides involved in this question.

Reporters Should Be Allowed
To Attend EC Meetings

The Executive Committee’s proposed constitution, it ap-
pears to us, lacks one major factor, and we hope that this sit-
uation eventually will be rectified.

The area of which we are speaking pertains to the closed
meetings which the Executive Committee is presently condon-
ing. The EC has chosen to keep their legislative meetings
closed——not open to reporters from various campus media.
As a result of the ‘closed’? meetings, the EC is enclosed by a
web of secrecy.

Of course the EC members will tell you that the minutes
are being published and that the EC is available for comment
on current matters. The system of the dissemination of inform-
ation from the Committee’s meetings, we must asert, is one
which needs changing, since the Ring-tum Phi, along with oth-

its usefulness is suspect. However,
there are certain facts that can be
stated with some assurance and
other aspects which can be looked
to for a reasonable indication of
what sort of military establish-
ment has been developed by the
Soviet Union.

Historically the Russians have
never produced a good army. The
forces used in the eighteenth cen-
tury and in the nineteenth against
Napoleon, the Ottoman Empire
and in the Crimean War were
characterized by their largeness
on the one hand and thir inepti-
tude on the other. This condition
tended to get worse instead of
better and was climaxed by the
defeat at the hands of the Japan-
ese in 1905 and the complete col-
lapse of the military in 1917.

Under the Soviet government
the constituted forces continued to
be notably inefficient. The re-
verses initially inflicted on them
by Finland in 1937 once again
pointed up the general ineffective-
ness of Russian arms. Through the
rest of World War II the Soviet
Armies, while defeating the Ger-
mans, at no time displayed more
than the most rudimentary stra-
tegic and tactical ability. Although
the double envelopment was much
talked of, it was rarely success-
fully executed. The use of the
frontal attack combined with
crudly massed artillery was their
most common approach.

It would be heartening if it
could be assumed that the histori-
cal pattern would continue. In
fact it might—but there are cer-
tain changes, most of them non-
military, which indicate that sub-
stantial refinement has_ taken
place.

The Russian approach still tends
to be one of mass. They have in
their standing army about 175

   

in the fraternity, and for no loss
of revenue to the fraternities dur-
ing the sophomore year. By a lit-
tle arithmetic (which is one course
I have was motivated by), the loss
of freshman revenue by the house
house with 20 pledges would mean
about a $10 raise per month for
the actives—or about the same as
social assessments for a period of
a year.

While our House, and most oth-
er houses, would never willingly
subscribe to the postponing of
Rush until the sophomore year,
there may be an area of improve-
ment on which we can settle. It
will be interesting to see if the
IFC members can come up with a

(Continued on page 4)

Have Had A Good Army

divisions with an organized re-
serve which will raise this to ap-
proximately 300 in time of war.
While these divisions are only
about one-half the size of an Am-
erican one and include support
type units grouped in division-
size organizations they still con-
stitute a larger in-being force than
that supported by the United
States.

Parity must be assumed in com-
bat aircraft while the naval capa-
bility of the United States remains
ahead of the Russians.

In addition, of course, the Soviet
Union has nuclear weapons which
in both amount and destructive
ability can be presumed equal to
ours.

However, Russia has always
been able to impress in terms of
size. Significant changes are to
be found in other areas.

Never before has the Russian
army been able to rely upon a lit-
erate soldiery who, in addition, are
becoming increasingly familiar
with the gadgetry of an indus-
tralized nation. This is vital to her
because it allows both the produc-
tion and intelligent use of soph-
isticated equipment and in turn
far more rapid and advanced
training. This education and back-
ground is important not only in
the combat skills of the soldiers
and officers but also in the effici-
ency of staffing procedures. There
is a much more direct relationship
between educated officers from an
industrial society and competence
in logistics for instance than there
is between effective front-line
soldiers and literacy. An indica-
tion of the progress in this area
may be taken from the rapid con-
centration of forces carried on by
the Russians during the Hungari-
an revolt. The staff planning in-

volved in that move must have
been of a very high order.

The industrial progress in the
Soviet Union will allow the pro-
duction of not only the more nor-
mal weapons of war but also
large amounts of such things as
communications equipment and
gunnery devices which have al-

their military thinking seems ad-
vanced and sound.

The foregoing indicate that we
must anticipate a greatly improv-
ed military establishment. There
are, however, some indices which
raise a degree of legitimate doubt
as to how much improvement.

The first and most obvious one

While the Russian soldier is not
a fanatic (up to battalion-size

counted on as loyal in a political
sense, strongly motivated nation-

The EC, in our opinion, must remember that it was stu- |

owes to those students who elected them a right to be informed | |

The EC fails to realize that in their meetings they, like any
governing body, can go into “executive session’”’ at any point,
and the press would be asked to leave the meeting.

The proposed abolishing of the representative from the
Publications Board, like it or not, will eliminate a contact be-

to point out to

of the difficulties I think they might

attempt to move rush week to
sophomore year.

One of the points in the petition
is that it would eliminate the stig-
ma attached to NFU’s. I maintain
that it would only increase what-
ever stigma they’re talking about,
and would further damage all of the
interrelations of non-fraternity men.

By this I mean that for a solid
year there would be a whole class
full of nothing but NFU’s, and fra-
ternity men would be perfectly jus-
tified in shunning them socially.
This would be a natural reaction

to the threat which would be posed
to their system. And among NFU’s
themselves, no good would come of

a sudden increase in the roll of the
Campus Club.

NFU’s would have no way on
earth of knowing who was a short-
term NFU, and who is one for the
duration. This would leave a tre-

mendous gap in the social life of
all students concerned—a gap which

the faculty would do well to consid-
er.

Like Bull Roberts says, some of
my best friends are NFU’s, and
I’m always careful to make sure that
I meet several each year in order
not to be charged with discrimina-
tion. But imagine the position stu-
dents (NFU’s and fraternity men
alike) will be in if no one knows

the Soviet army has not been in
combat since 1945. It is interest-
ing to note in this connection that
whenever Soviet advised troops
have fought in the type of warfare
which would be used in Europe in
a non-active atomic war they have
reverted to the mass frontal at-
tack techniques. Guerilla warfare
as used in Southeast Asia can-
not be credited to the Russians
but rather to the Chinese.

From the point of view of size,
The Soviet Union while maintain-
ing a larger force does not have
any where near the margin for
expansion in time of war that the
United States has. Her require-
ment for a proportionally high
farm population and her smaller,
less efficient industrial base limits
her severely in this respect.

In addition a certain clumsiness
in the logistic field continues to
plague Soviet operations as for
example their large-scale maneu-
vers in Europe.

Tactically her artillery tech-
niques remain weak in compari-
son to the United States.

It is patent that the Soviet Union
has made real gains in the mili-
tary field. Gains which are large-
ly the result of the over-all ad-
vances in literacy and the eco-
nomic capability of the country.
On the other hand it is doubtful
that they have overcome a certain
rigidity in both command and staff
work, and further, have really ab-
andoned the characteristic fas-
cination with mass as the basic so-
lution to all tactical problems.

There is no real answer to the
effectiveness of any military es-
tablishment except war. The hope
is that the answer will never
come. In line with this, it is of
more than passing interest that at
no point where American troops
have been presented has_ the
West lost ground.

SUPAK, PATERNO PACE VICTORY

 

Five Players Hit Double Figures
As Generals Swat Wasps, 99-81

By HARRY MEEM
Tuesday Sports Writer

Washington and Lee’s bas-
ketball team went on a scor-
ing binge Saturday night in
the last home game of the sea-
son, beating the Emory and

Henry Wasps 99-81.

The Generals put five players in
double figures, topped by Tom Su-
pak’s 22 points. Emory and Hen-
ry’ Gerald Burke was high scorer
for the game with 29.

W. and L. took the lead for the
first time in the game with six min-
utes left in the first half, when Bill

 

The Generals bowed to Norfolk
William and Mary last night, 75-
69 in their final game of the sea-
son.

Tom Supak led the Generals
with 24 points while Bip Fauber
threw in 13 markers.

The Monarchs closed with a
17-3 season slate. Their last loss
came at the hands of the Generals
January 22. They went on to win
11 in a row and close with the best
court record in their history.

 

Ide hit on a jump shot to make the
score 20-18. Rodger Fauber, Mike
Monier, and Ide pushed the lead to
30-26 before the Wasps came back,
on the shooting of Bob and Jim
Hughes, to take a 39-36 halftime
lead.

Then came the explosive sec-
ond half, in which the Generals
scored 63 points, more than they
scored in both halves when they

 

lost, 75-55, at Emory.

Jim Hughes and Burke hit on
jump shots for the Wasps, sand-
wiched around a jump shot by the
Generals’ Louie Paterno, to make
the score 43-38. Then Paterno, Fau-
ber, and Ide started hitting, large-
ly on jump shots, to run the score

to 49 for W. and L. before Emary
and Henry could score again.
Fauber’s layup at 17:50 of the half
gave the Generals a lead that they
never relinquished.
Paterno, Fauber, Monier, Ide and
Tom Supak continued to hit on a
(Continued on page 4)

 

ended in a 14-14 tie.

Sparked by halfback Henry Sackett’s power thrusts and
quarterback Chuck Lane’s imaginative play selection, the var-
sity took the opening kick-off and drove to the alumni’s 20-

yard line where they relinquished the ball.

The varsity held the alumni to*

three downs, and a high pass to the
punter, Steve Suttle, gave the ball to
McLaughlin’s charges on the alumni
12 yard line. John McDaniel skirt-
ed the right end on the third play
from scrimmage and scored standing
up to give the varsity a 6-0 lead.
The conversion attempt by Lane
added two more points for the var-
sity.

The remainder of the first half
was a defensive stand-off with
neither team being able to pene-
trate deep into the other’s terri-
tory.

Henry Sackett received the kick-
off in the second half on his own 30
and sped up the middle for 70 yards
to score putting the varsity ahead
14-0.

Wood Passes

The only serious alumni threat in
the third period came when the
Robin Wood, Wyatt Durette, and
Phil Sharp aerial trio combined to
drive to the varsity’s 10-yard line.
There the defensive line, led by
Mike Sheffey, Tim Sylvester, and
Buck Ogilvie, stifled the ‘oldsters’
attempt to tally.

Suttle Scores
With four minutes remaining in

 

the game the alumni caught fire. A
wood to Suttle pass caught the var-
sity Red team napping, and put the
alumni back in the game 14-6, the
two point conversion brought the
score to 14-8,

The alumni took over again at
mid-field and eight plays later
Dave Tharp took the ball over
from the two-yard line to even
the score 14-14,

The contest exposed several weak
spots to be mended before the 1962
season, but Coaches Lee Mc-
Laughlin, Leslie, and Williams were
pleased with the varsity’s perform-
ance against the heavier alumni.

Half-back Bill David and tackle
Chuck Long, both rising sopho-
mores, turned in exceptional per-
formances. Mike Sheffey proved
himself as an offensive center, and
on defense may prove to be more
than an adequate replacement for
for departing Little All-Ameri-
can Terry Fohs.

Perhaps the most impressive per-
formances, least obvious on the
muddy field, were those of four
sophomore ends; Buck Ogilvie, Mike
Jenkins, John Madison, and Ed
Croft.

 

“Consistent,” a word seldom used
to describe Washington and Lee’s
basketball, is the best possible de-
scription of sophomore guard Tom
Supak.

Since the Christmas break, Supak,
who is from Virginia Beach, has
been the workhorse on a W&L team
that has dropped to a 6-10 record.
After scoring only 35 points in the
Generals first five games, Supak
hit his stride with a 30-point effort
against Lynchburg College January
6 and he hasn’t let up since.

Only once in the last nine games
has the 6-2 guard, who loves to
drive for his baskets, dipped un-
der 16 points. His average for
these nine games is 18.3 and his
season mark is 14,3,

If W&L’s opponents are any judge
of Supak’s ability, he must be rat-
ed high on the list. In the Generals’
last four games the opponents have

started in a man-for-man defense,
but three of them changed to a zone
to stop Supak’s driving. The fourth
remained in a man-for-man set-up
only because it had a 30-point lead.
Supak scored a total of 76 points
in these four games, and 46 of
these came in the first half against
primarily man-for-man defenses.

“Tommy is our best driver,”
says Coach Bob McHenry. “Be-
cause of his driving ability we try
to set him up in one-on-one sit-
uations. We think he can beat

Despite being a guard, Supak is
the Generals’ fourth leading re-

Fauber leads the team in rebounds,

W&L Gains Prestige For Top Debating Team

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Washington and Lee’s de-
bate team is rapidly becoming
recognized as being one of the
top notch in the nation.

Debate Team
Places Fourth

Debating in last Saturday’s Invi-
tational Tournament held at Mt.
Mercy College in Pittsburgh, Wash-
ington and Lee’s debate team placed

 

fourth among thirteen competing
colleges.
Al Eckes and Bill Boardman,

W&L’s affirmative team, posted a
40-0 tournament record. Both Eckes
and Boardman won awards of ex-
cellence.

Judged second among tourna-
ment debaters, Eckes was selected
from a field of fifty-two debaters
representing the thirteen colleges.

Eckes now boasts a team record
of nine consecutive victories. Fin-
ishing two points behind Eckes, Bill
Boardman also won an award.

Losing to the three top teams in
the tournament, Ed Norton and
Steve Smith of the Negative team
posted a 1-3 record.

The debate team finished with an
overall tournament record of 5-3.

Rising almost meteorically over ,
the past year, the team is in a po-
sition today to take on some of the
nation’s most formidable opponents.
In addition to its rapid rise, how-
ever, the breadth of program here
makes it one of the most unusual in
the country.

William Chaffin, director of de-
bate activities at W&L, estimated
that by the end of this semester
“some 50 students will have taken
part in debate and discussions on a
college level, here this year.”

Trains Large Numbers

“We differ quite a bit from other
colleges in this respect.” Chaffin said,
“We are interested in training large
numbers of students, rather than
spending a great deal of time with
just a small group. The average
school has only eight to twelve per-
sons on a team.

“Of course students of greater
ability who are willing to put in
more time on debate work will be
used to a greater extent than others.
However, anyone who is interested,
regardless of ability, can take part

Debate Interest Was Low

When Chaffin first came here more
than a year and a half ago, inter-
collegiate debate at W&L was in a
lethargic state. Debate activity was
kept alive by only a very small
group of interested students. With
hard work and driving spirit Chaf-
fin built the team to its present size.

W&L Wins State Award

For the second year in a row
W&L has captured the state cham-
pionship in debating. In various
tournaments throughout the year,
six students have won _ individual
awards for excellence in debating.

wide range of shots, from hooks and
taps by Monier to jump shots by
Supek and Fauber, to increase the
lead to the final eighteen point
bulge.

For W. and L., Tom Supak had
22 points on eight field goals and
six free throws, Bill Ide had 18
points, Paterno got 16, Monier 14,
and Fauber added 12. Burke and
Bob Hughes hit double figures
for the Wasps, with 29 and 14
points respectively.

In the second half, the Generals
sank 23 of 43 shots from the floor,
for a respectable 53.5 per cent. For
the game, they made 37 of 78, 47.4
per cent. The Wasps hit 27 of 69, 39.1
per cent.

W. and L.’s 18 point margin came
from the 10-basket edge in field
goals. From the foul line, Emory
and Henry hit 27 of 33, as opposed to
W. and L.’s 25 of 28.

The Wasps picked off four re-
bounds more than the Generals,
48-44. High man in that department
was the visitors’ Leonard Shelor,
who pulled in 14. Monier led the
Generals with nine, followed by
Ide’s eight. Fauber and Tom Su-
pak each had five.

Judged by the score, this was
not a defensive ball game. But
many of the Generals’ points in
the second half came on layups
after they stole the ball from the
Wasps at mid-court, or on a fast
break after a rebound.

Saturday night’s game was the
last one in Doremus gym for seniors
Ide and Monier.

The Generals closed their season
Monday night at Norfolk, in a con-
test with the Norfolk College Mon-
archs. They went into the contest
with a 6-11 record.

All Frosh. Will Be NFU’s

(Continued from page 2)

who is and who isn’t NFU. For a sol-
id year everyone would be in doubt
about who they could associate with
without being astigmatized .

I don’t want to deal, however, on
the social problem involved in such
a move. I would rather consider
some of the physical aspects of the
question.

“Where would all those sopho-
mores live?” I hear students asking.

Not wishing to take sides either
for or against, I offer the faculty
this solution to that problem. You
can save all the Saran-wrap used on
the science building, and also re-
quire all freshmen to conserve their
shirt-bags throughout the year.
Then a tent-city could be put up
on the front lawn to accommodate
rushees during that hectic week.

This will also solve the problem
of finding rooms of rushees for
the upperclassmen, for they can see
everyone at a glance. And then af-
ter rush week all the NFU’s can be
suffocated in their sleep by collaps-
ing the tents, thus eliminating an
undesirable element once and for
all.

If this sounds a little ridiculous,
let me remind you that this is the
season for the ridiculous.

As for myself I find that the fac-
ulty peition pushers have sensed
a problem but have come up with
a short-sighted solution. Why, I ask,
should the privilege of fraternity
membership be offered to sopho-
mores once it has been wrested
away from freshmen?

It seems that here is a chance to
strengthen the fraternity system by
allowing only seniors to join. This
would do away with all the imma-
turity extant in fraternities, and

would place the house on a level
with ODK and Phi Beta Kappa.

If the faculty restricts fraternity
membership to seniors then they
can be sure that only responsible
men would be allowed to join in the
social circle of fraternal brother-
hood. Gone would be the childish,
adolescent elements of fraternity
life, and what would remain would
be a group of mature students who
have entered into a lasting relation-
ship based on sound judgment rath-
er than self-seeking motivations.

And so, faculty, I ask you to re-
consider. Don’t be satisfied with
simple solutions, but get down to the
real problem. Don’t eliminate fresh-
man rush, eliminate freshmen. Don’t
destroy the NFU stigma, destroy the
NFU. You have a chance to do
something here, gentlemen. I hope
you get it done.

constructive change.

WITH ANOTHER crisis possibly
rising for the fraternities, it is
again opportune to bring up the
subject of a central purchasing
agency for the 18 houses on cam-
pus. Such an agency could pos-
sibly save the houses enough
money to compensate for any loss
of revenue encountered in an al-
teration of the fraternity system.
Why not look into it?
