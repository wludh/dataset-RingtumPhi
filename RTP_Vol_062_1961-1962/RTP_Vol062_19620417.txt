‘HILL’ SCRAPS IFC COMBO

New Constitution, Amendments

Amendment Presented To Allow

Press Coverage Of EC

By KEN LANE
Associate Editor

The new student body constitution proposed by the EC
was presented in an open forum last night by student body

president Uncas McThenia.

The purpose of the forum was to allow students to discuss
the new constitution before it is submitted on the election ballot

Thursday, April 26, for student body vote.

 

Before a turnout of about 15 stu-*

dents in Lee Chapel, McThenia re-
viewed the changes which the con-
stitution provides for, and opened the
floor for comments.

The discussion was centered
around the failure of the constitution
to replace the Publications Commit-
teeman by an elected representative,
and the failure to provide for a
student senate.

Petition Read

A petition was read by Roy Good-
win, representing the Tuesday edi-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi and the
Sigma Delta Chi journalistic society,
requesting that an amendment be
added providing for press represen-
tation on the EC.

Later in the meeting, a constitu-
tion was proposed by senior Ben
Brown, providing for a student sen-
ate and for changes in the pro-
cedure of Honor trials.

Spud Slater

Senior Spud Slater opened the
forum discussion by asking why the
EC had decided to retain its Publi-
cations member.

Committeeman John Paul re-
plied that the amendment failed to
get the two-thirds majority by a
close 7-5 vote. No agreement could
be made for getting a satisfactory
replacement,

Rosie Page stated that the Publi-
cations Board was felt to be one of
the most responsible bodies on cam-
pus and it is certain that the rep-
resentative selected is well-qualified.

Spud Slater asked why the EC had
not introduced a student senate in
student body government.

McThenia replied that a study of
other universities found that the
senate did not succeed except in
much larger student bodies.

The amendment petition for press
representation was read by Good-
win before the assembly. It will be
voted on at the Student Body Elec-
tion polls on April 26.

It stated as follows:

We the undersigned, hereby sub-
mit the enclosed amendment to the
Student Body Constitution, said
amendment to appear on the bal-
lot to be used

in the Student

Legislative meetings of the Ex-
ecutive Committee shall be open
to members of the campus press.
This shall include one reporter
from each edition of the Ring-tum
Phi, one member of the staff of
Home Edition, and one member
from each of the other recognized
media who choose to attend the
meetings.

The Executive Committee shall
retain the right of Executive Ses-
sion when such a session is called
by an E.C. member and approved
by a majority vote of the standing
E.C.

Ben Brown’s constitution will also
be voted on during the elections.
Among its major features is the in-
situation of the “advisor” and the
“examiner” in the Honor trials.
Brown explained that these two will
serve as a psychological aid to the
defendant.

The accused selects his own advis-
or before he makes any decisions.
The advisor will keep him informed
on the best course of action and try
to prevent the defendant from mak-
ing any rash action out of ignorance.

New Feature

A second feature of the consti-
tution was a student senate of 30
representatives. The purpose of the
senate, Brown stated, is to create
a “power vacuum” within the stu-
dent body with the hope that stu-
dents will respond to the challenge.

Senate Criticized

The idea of a senate received con-
siderable criticism. Steve Galef felt
that the senate would consume too
much time and students would lose
interest.

Tim Ireland termed it as “nice and
idealistic,’ but it would lead to “a
30-man captive audience.”

Meade Christian felt that it would
create more responsibilities than stu-
dents are willing to assume.

Brown Defends Senate

When questioned on the purpose
of the student senate, Brown stated
that it would “provide more repre-
sentation on campus, encourage more
student involvement in university
affairs, and also act as an adequate
forum for airing out student is-
sues.”

Brown optimistically spoke of the

Faculty Action Overrides

Earlier IFC Ruling”

By JOHN ALLGOOD ~<
Asst. Managing Editor

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities abruptly solved
the problem of conflicts between fraternity combos-and Uni-

versity dance Svsotiane
Dean Atwood infor
at its weekly meeting last night that
the action had been taken at the
recommendation of the Social Func-
tions Committee of the faculty.
The rule passed by the faculty
committee, as reported by Dean At-
wood states:

“There is to be no paid musical
entertainment by fraternities dur-
ing the hours of any University
dance function, i.e., both dances
and concerts.”

Ignore IFC

The action followed by only two
weeks action taken by the IFC to
discourage Friday night combos on
dance weekends and _ completely
wipes out the IFC action.

IFC president Bob Doenges, Sig-
ma Chi senior, expressed sorrow that
all the work the IFC had done to-

 

SIPA Conference To Feature
J.B.Reston And Hal Foster

James B. Reston, nationally
known columnist of The New
York Times, and Hal Foster,
creator of the cartoon charac-
ter “Prince Valiant,” will be
principal speakers for the 33rd

annual convention of the
Southern Interscholastic Press
Association.

The convention of more than 1,100
delegates will be held here April
27-28.

Reston will speak to the secon-
dary school representatives at 12:05
that Friday in Doremus Gymnasium.
Foster will follow him at 1:55 p.m.
These talks will also be open to
W&L students.

Reston Joins Times

Reston joined the New York Times
staff in its London Bureau in 1939.
Since that time he has reported na-
tional and international events for
the Times Organization. He remained
in London until 1941, when he re-
turned to the United States to work
at the Washington Bureau. There he
specialized in diplomatic and foreign
affairs.

Early in 1943 he was made an
assistant to the publisher, Arthur
Hays Sulzberger, and later that
year returned to London as acting
head of the Times Bureau.

In 1945 he became national cor-
respondent, and after the war was
named diplomatic correspondent
covering important national and in-
ternational political events. Today
he heads the Times Washington
Bureau.

 

Concert Guild To Present
Award Winning Pianist

An international award winning
pianist Wednesday will present the
fifth concert in the current season
of the Washington and Lee Concert
Guild.

Kenneth Amada, who holds an
award from 1960 International Queen
Elizabeth of Belgium Competition,
will play at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.
His program will include Beeth-
oven’s Sonata, Opus 53 in G Major
(Waldstein), Profokieff’s Sonata No.
7, Opus 83, Bach’s Italian Concerto
and Liszt’s Mephisto Waltz.

Amada began study of piano at
the age of three and made his debut
in Town Hall in 1951. His orchestral
appearances have been with the
Detroit Symphony, the Buffalo, the
Baltimore Symphony, the Warsaw
Philharmonic and the National Or-

;|chestra of Belgium.

 

During the early part of World
War II, he served as head of the
Information Service of the Office of
War Intelligence in the American
Embassy.

In 1944 Reston was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize for his news dis-
patches and interpretative articles
on the Dumbarton Oaks Security
Conference. Again in 1957 he won
a Pulitizer Award for national re-
porting.

Debate Team
Wins On TV

By C. C. FLIPPEN
Associate Editor

 

Washington and Lee debaters con-
tinued their television debate win-
ning streak by defeating Davidson
College last week at Chapel Hill,
= ©.

Veteran debaters Al Eckes, Bill
Boardman, and Bill Noell success-
fully defended the affirmative side of
the Question, Resolved: That Capital
Punishment Be Abolished. The hour
long match was carried over WUNC
in Chapel Hill, April 9.

Of the teams competing in the
series only W&L and Wake Forest
remain undefeated. They will meet
to determine the championship on
May 14. The topic for this final
debate has not yet been chosen.

Sunday Eckes and Noell took part
in another television debate held
over WRVA-TV in Richmond. The
two debated a team from Randolph-
Macon College on the topic, Re-
solved: That the United States With-
draw from the United Nations.

No decision was given, but Wil-
liam Chaffin, director of debate ac-
tivities said today “the producers
of the show were so impressed by
the debate that they have an-
nounced plans to carry ten weeks
of similar programs next fall with
scholarships going to winning
schools,”

This Richmond Television debate
marked the fourth of five scheduled
TV appearances for the W&L team
since February.

Norton, Morris Enter

In debate activity over the holi-
days Ed Norton and Malcolm Mor-
ris were entered in the Georgetown
Novice Tournament. They debated
four rounds on both sides of the
national debate question and com-
piled a 2-2 record. The tournament
was held March 31.

 

Among his other awards and hon-
ors are several honorary degrees
from universities throughout the na -
tion, the Overseas Press Club
Award, Chevalier de la Legion
d’Honneur and the University of
Missouri Medal of Honor for dis-
tinguished service in journalism.

Hal Foster began his varied career
far from the field of Journalism or
cartooning. At the age of 14 he was
a fur trapper helping to support his
family in Nova Scotia. At 18 he quit
school to work full time in support-
ing his family.

During the next three years he
worked as office helper, a guide in
the forests of Canada and a gold
prospector.

In 1921 Foster determined on a
career as an artist and enrolled as
a student in the Art Institute,
Academy of Fine Arts and the Na-
tional Academy in Chicago.

In addition to these and other
speakers the weekend convention
will include judging and awards to
various scholastic publications. More
than 175 schools have submitted the
305 publications to be judged. They
come from ten southern states and
Washington.

Last year, The Chatterbox of
George Washington High School
in Danville, Va., was the winner of
the Scholastic Press Award of the
Virginia Press Association.

The other three state scholastic
press awards were the Wildcat of
New Tanover High School in N. C.,
the Pequonion of Elkview High
School in W. Va., and The Yellow
Jacket of Boys High School in S. C.

 

Psychology Professors
To Participate In Meet

Two Washington and Lee psy-
chology professors will participate
in the program of the 45th annual
meeting of the Southern Society for
Philosophy and Psychology in Mem-
phis, Tenn., April 19-21.

Dr. William W. Hinton, head of
the university’s psychology depart-
ment, is president of the society
and will direct the convention.

Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant
professor of psychology at Washing-
ton and Lee, will present a paper
on the “Effects of X-irradiation on
Operant Behavior in the Rat” during
a morning session on conditioning
and learning.

The meeting will include seminars,
symposiums, general sessions and
exhibits and displays from various
universities and colleges throughout
the South.

yesterday afternoon.

 

the IFC*

 

ward solving this problem had seem-
ingly been wasted .

“The faculty has overruled the IFC
and taken what action that it deemed
necessary to solve the problem,”
Doenges said.

The IFC action wiped out by the
faculty provided:

1. All fraternity combo parties in
conflict with University sponsored
dances on Friday nights of dance
weekends will be closed. Closed is
to be defined as members of one fra-
ternity only and the party shall be
held in the house of that fraternity.

2. No fraternity may compel one
of its members to pay an extra so-
cial assessment for said combo to be
held in conflict...if that member
wishes to attend the dance instead
of the combo party.

COeeeeeecececcesoeseeses
(See editorial on page 2)
COCCCH COCO COO OECOCEOEEEE

Doenges said when the IFC passed
their regulations that, “this new IFC
amendment, I feel, will bring about a
gradual and effective solution to the
combo-University dance conflict. It
does not radically forbid combos at
any time, but it does provide rules
to prevent any slight or large ma-
jority in any house from forcing
their will for a combo upon a mi-
nority.”

Today Doenges still says “the IFC’s
action would have been a solution
to the problem, but the faculty failed
to give it a chance to work.”

The Faculty Committee on Frater-
nities is composed of Dean W. W.
Pusey, III; professors Jarrard, Phil-
lips, Spencer, Starling, Stephenson,
Stevens; Mr. Mattingly, Mr. Farrar.

Dance Board President

President of the Dance Board,
Steve Galef, stated that he was sorry
to see the faculty action. However,
he added that the students should
have taken a firmer stand from the
start.

Faculty Committee Combo Rule
Denies Basic LFC Right

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities’ action yesterday
which bans fraternity combos during the hours of Univer-
sity sponsored social functions, in our opinion, has further
denied the IFC a basic right to have control over its individual
members.

The fear of “intervention” from the hill may have been
present in the IFC before yesterday’s action, but today that
fear has been given a front row seat in the IFC meetings.

The mandate issued Monday has clearly taken more power
from the students’ hands, right or wrong, and has put it into
the hands of the Administration.

The EFC recently passed what in our opinion was a
workable solution to the combo question in that the
IFC rule prohibited “double spending” for entertain-
ment. We believe that the IFC rule would have worked
had it been given a reasonable period of time to prove
itself. The IFC’s plan perhaps was weak in the eyes of
those in power, but we firmly believe that it should have
been given a chance to work before it was killed.

The Faculty Committee on Fraternities, we are sad to re-
port, has now squelched any future hope the IFC may have
had for handling their own problems in their own way. The
Administration also has made it clear that there is only one
side of questions—their side.

It is a heartbreaking fact that the IFC and the Adminis-
tration apparently could not get together and work up a so-
lution to the problem.

It is equally heartbreaking to the students to see that the
Administration has resorted to a ‘“‘jam it down the students’
throats’”’ method which does not characterize the way in which
Washington and Lee has or should operate.

The Tuesday Edition feels that the IFC has done
much this year in cooperating with the Dance Board.
As evidenced by the attendance at all the dances this
year, IFC action has worked, and we feel that more co-
operation was on the way, had the IFC’s rule been given
a chance to work.

For all three dance sets this year the IFC has acted to deny
fraternity competition with the University social functions.
This action delayed, and in the case of Springs, it prohibited
combos during the hours of University events. Dance atten-
dance has also been far better than that of last year, and one
cannot overlook the part the IFC has played in this progress.
It seems to us, however, the Faculty Committee has chosen to
“forget” these incidents of cooperation.

As Tuesday Columnist George Honts says elsewhere on
this page, perhaps the IFC is to blame for the intervention.
We, however, cannot altogether accept this premise since the
IFC plan was never given a chance to work.

The long-range effects of this action will have the
result, we fear, that no matter what the IFC wants, the
Administration is going to do what it wants. We also
feel that it is all too obvious that the above isn’t in keep-
ing with W&L’s belief of student control over students,
as witnessed by our Honor System, the Student Control
Committee, etc.

We sincerely hope that yesterday’s decision by the Faculty
Committee on Fraternities is not an indication of the direction
in which this University seems to be heading.

Tuesday Edition’s Amendment
For Press Representation

The Tuesday Edition, in conjunction with Sigma Delta Chi,
national journalistic society, has co-sponsored an amendment
which will be voted upon in the Student Body elections to be
held April 26.

Our amendment, which is presented in what we feel are
the best interest of Washington and Lee, would insure that
members of the recognized campus press are not denied the
right to attend the legislative (and only the legislative) meet-
ings of the Executive Committee.

We are the first to realize that there are a number of oc-
casions which dictate that a certain amount of secrecy in govern-
ment be allowed. For this reason, we have included in our reso-
lution a stipulation which gives the Executive Committee the
leeway of holding “executive sessions” when the Committee, by
a majorty vote, deems it necessary.

The Executive Committee this year has been highly cooper-
ative with the Tuesday Edition, and we sincerely thank the EC
for this attitude. The EC recently has allowed us to attend the
legislative meetings and for this move we were, and are, grate-
ful. But what of the future Executive Committees?

We, as members of the press which is supposed to be the
“Voice of the Student Body,” feel that we should be given
constitutional protection for our basic rights, and for this reason
we have sponsored this bill.

It is our sincere hope that the Student Body will endorse
our move, which we feel is in the students’ best interests, by
voting “yes” for this amendment.

(The entire amendment is printed on page 1 of today’s
paper.)

(Continued on page 4)

Editor’s Note: The following article appeared
in Sunday’s Roanoke Times-World News.

Generations of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity students have learned about the Civil
War from Dr. William Gleason Bean.

His lectures on the war, its battles and its
many personalities are still vivid in the mem-
ories of many. For them, there has been no
other expert.

The tall Alabama native drew on a vast
storehouse of information to make the Civil

 

War just about the most interesting period in
the nation’s history.

The students soon learned this was Dr. Bean’s
favorite period of American History. As a
youngster in Alabama, he heard members of his
family talk about their experiences in the war
and this was his first knowledge of history.

The struggle was “our great war.” Dr. Bean
believes, and it brought unity to the nation.

This June Dr. Bean will conclude a 40-year
career in education when he retires as head of
W&L’s history department where he has been
Doughlas Southall Freeman Professor of His-
tory and a Professor on the Thomas Ball Foun-
dation.

Dr. W. G. Bean (left) discusses historical papers with Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw.

He will turn over his duties to Ollinger Cren-
shaw who came to W&L as a freshman the year
Dr. Bean began his teaching career at Gen.
Lee’s school.

There still will be some teaching. Dr. Bean
will continue to teach two courses three days
a week.

Retirement will not mean an end to his work,
though. He has a number of writing tasks,
travel and reading on his schedule. There will

be plenty of work to do in Lexington—“My
wife is going to keep me busy,” he notes.
Those who know the historian and teacher
also know he’ll have plenty of time for those
walks, too. “I’m a great walker,” he states. Be-
yond that there’ll be the garden to tend to also.

He terms the most significant event during his
teaching career as the development of a system
under which grants are awarded to teachers for
study and research on books and articles.

As for retirement, one of the bright points
he sees is that he will not have to devote so
much of his time to grading papers.

He will soon have another book ready, having
completed the first draft on the Liberty Hall

 

W&L Men Will Remember Dr. Bean
As The Expert Civil War Historian

Volunteers, Washington College students who
served with the Stonewall Jackson Brigade
during the Civil War. He plans to call it “Col-
lege Boys in Gray.”

Dr. Bean is also editing the diary of John
Apperson, a medical orderly in the Stonewall
Brigade who became a prominent Western Vir-
ginia doctor after the war. A daughter, Miss
Mary Apperson, lives in Blacksburg and his
son, the late Harvey B. Apperson, was a
prominent Roanoke area attorney before going
to the State Supreme Court of Appeals.

The W&L professor is a member of the
Virginia Civil War Centennial Commission
and feels this unit has accomplished much
by providing an information center in Rich-
mond where people can learn about the broad
scope of the battles before going to view the
sites,

The Heflin, Ala., native first became in-
volved in the field of education after he gradu-
ated from high school at the age of 16. His
father thought he was too young to go to col-
lege. So he began his 40-year career teaching
in rural schools.

The lanky youngster then went to the Uni-
versity of Alabama in 1910 and completed his
work in three years. He got into the field of
higher education while a graduate student at
Harvard from 1920 to 1922.

The future head of W&L’s history depart-
ment came to the Lexington school in the fall
of 1922 and became head of the department in
1930. He previously had been acting head for
three years.

Looking back on his career, he can recall a
lot of “good memories.” Working with young
students has been very interesting and he’s
particularly proud of the students who have
joined him in the field of teaching history.

The development of an honors program at
W&L, he believes, has been very beneficial to
students. “It’s a little master’s degree,” he notes
of the thesis program.

Dr. Bean believes young historians ought to
consider writing histories of Western Virginia
counties, cities and towns. The field has hard-
ly been touched, he states. This goes along
with his belief that greater emphasis on re-
search in colleges has been vital to the
growth and development of higher education.

With more leisure time, Dr. Bean plans to
return to the many important battlefields for
more study. He would like to take another
look at Little Round Top at Gettysburg.

The real fighting in the great battle took place
there during the first and second days, he
states. Greater emphasis is placed on Pickett’s
Charge, but it was over in 15 minutes.

 

“The Craven’s Guide To Staying In School Indefinitely’

By THORNS CRAVEN ee

Failure Of IFC To Compromise

Tuesday Columnist

With the end of school rapidly approaching, and my im-

 

 

 

pending graduation looming larger, I have begun to make
some forays into the outside world to see what it will be like.

Twice
crawled out of the Washington and
Lee womb in order to make con-
tact with government and private
interests. If you want my advice,
stay in school for the rest of your
life. Working doesn’t look like it’s
going to be much fun.

I can back up that statement with
a few examples of the things I’ve
learned in my recent interviews,
and I think you'll be able to see
the contrasts with our sheltered
life here when it’s compared with
the bomb-sheltered life out there.

In the first place, I’ve learned
that there are absolutely no cuts.
Those of you without cuts realize
the hardships which are encountered
in this situation, and I’m sure
those of you with them can imagine
the horrors contained in a system
that operates in this manner.

If, perchance, you think you'll
find some exception to this general
pattern I can assure you that you
won't. I’ve investigated this from
every angle, and there’s just no
way out.

Another related horror of the out-
side world is the shift system. Un-
fortunately college-trained business
leaders have never felt it necessary
to put their affairs on our more
cilivized basis of class hours.

They all go to work at 8:30 miss-
ing the advantage of the lucky stu-
dent having all 10:15’s.

When thinking about my exper-
ience with interviewers there seems
to be only one conclusion to make,
and only one gem of wisdom to
offer you. The only decision concern-
ing my post-graduation endeavours
that I have made is that work will
be hard, and therefore, it is best not
to. So I’ve looked back on my col-
lege career to see how I could have
done things differently in order to
avoid working outside, and I think
that some of you might do well to
follow this course.

The best way to prepare for stay-
ing out of the outside world is to
never exceed a C average during
your first year here. Then flunk out

 

during the second semester of your

 

in the last month I’ve*

 

sophomore year. Get re-instated
after a couple of semesters of travel-
ing around, then flunk out again.
Go now to a mediocre little school,
flunk out there, and then get into
the worst possible school imaginable,
and finish up your college career in
a blaze of effort that shows you
really care. By this time you are old

enough to marry a bosses’ daughter, | ®

and are ready to enter the outside
word as an observer and not a par-
ticipator.

Students who have already gone
too far in college careers to follow
this handy guide to success should
try to get into the swing of things
at the appropriate level. Seniors are
doomed.

I can only recommend to all of
you that if it’s at all possible, stay
away from the outside. There’s noth-
ing but trouble there, and here you
only have to worry about the weath-

er.

Was Cause Of ‘Hill’s’ Action

By GEORGE HONTS
Tuesday Columnist

The faculty committee pronounce-
ment banning fraternity combos
during any uni-
versity social
function is a re-
grettable thing...
regrettable from
y the standpoint
- that the faculty
- feels impelled to
take such actions
on behalf of the
student body.

 

Undoubtedly
Honts many, if not most
m of the student

body looks upon the action with dis-
favor. Undoubtedly they do not see
the reasoning behind the move, just
as the faculty apparently is unable
to see why students feel they have
a right to combos.

I do not support the faculty com-
mittee move. I am opposed to the
faculty dictating policies of this na-
ture to the student body. On the
other hand, having a slight insight
to the faculty attitude toward the
area of “conflicting interest” be-
tween the university social functions
and the combos, it is clear that they
felt their action was necessary.

Who is to blame for the pro-
nouncement? The faculty committee
to a degree, but part of the blame
must rest upon the IFC represen-
tatives and/or the students who
handcuffed them in the effort to
make effective compromise earlier
this semester.

People on the “inside” tell me
that the IFC was on the verge of
an acceptable compromise in the
form of the banning of Friday night
combos on dance weekends. This
measure failed to pass by a 7 to 9
vote.

What is just as unfortunate as the
faculty committee dictation of poli-
cy is the fact that the IFC and the
faculty committee could not get to-
gether officially to discuss the situa-
tion. Such a discussion did not come
until yesterday when it was already

 

doomed by inaction or weak action
on the part of the IFC. Certainly
this is not to say that the IFC so-
cial committee and the IFC president
did not do all their power to present
a working formula. They did, with
the blessing of the Dance Board,
and the probable asquiescence of the
faculty committee, but the IFC chose
not to accept it.

It is my firm conviction that the
students of Washington and Lee are
capable of making decisions of this
nature for themselves. It is unfortu-
nate that they did not do so.

In the interest of harmony in stu-
dent-faculty relations and in the in-
terest of making the student body,
particularly fraternity men, more
aware of their responsibility, it is
my hope that this question is not
closed, that the faculty committee
will rescind its stand and let the
IFC reconsider its position on so-
cial functions. Realizing, however,
that this is a slim hope which will
not very likely be realized, may I
make the suggestion that the stu-
dents familiarize themselves with
the faculty attitudes on such matters
and perhaps do some constructive
thinking on their own so that such
situations will not continually de-

velop into misunderstandings of
this nature.
It is highly unpleasant to be

treated as a young teen-ager, es-
pecially in an environment which
has long had pride in the freedom
which it offers.

It is highly unpleasant to be dic-
tated to, but with a developing of a
more responsible attitude on the part
of the students, perhaps we can
stem the tide before it gets out of
hand.

Anderson, McKay, Patton
Highlight Sports Show;

Robrecht Wins Bout

The annual Valley Youth Fitness
and Sports Show came to the VMI
Fieldhouse this past weekend.

Sponsored by the Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce, this year’s offer-
ing featured Paul Anderson, world
champion weightlifter, Barry Mc-
Kay, who gave a tennis clinic,
Jimmy Patton, NFL all-pro foot-
ball player and Bob Davis, basket-
ball hall of famer.

Anderson, called the world’s
strongest man, lived up to his billing
by breaking the world record for the
military press of 407 lbs. with a hoist
of 416.

Robrecht Wins

Of special interest to W&L stu-
dents was Ray Robrecht’s unana-
mous win over Bobby Tomblin. Ro-
brecht outpointed the Richmond
middleweight in the feature bout
Saturday night to notch his thir-
teenth victory. The W&L boxer, who
fights for the Roanoke PAL, will
fight again April 24th in what he
thinks will be his last encounter
before hanging up his gloves.

Washington Edges Stickmen, 6-5

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The Sho-men from Washington
College defeated W&L’s_ winless
stickmen, 6-5, here Saturday.

Led by Skip Rudolph, who scored
four goals and had a key assist,
they tallied six goals to the Generals
five.

The most outstanding play of the
game was early in the third per-
iod when W&L defenseman and
Co-captain Bart Mitchell inter-
cepted a shot in front of the Gen-
erals’ goal and sprinted all the
way downfield to tie the score,
2-2,

Rudolph, a senior attackman and
Marylands’ high scorer last year,
turned in his assist on a goal by
Dave Rodgers, three minutes into
the final quarter. It sent Washington
ahead for good with a score of 5-4,
after the score had been tied four
times. Thirty-six seconds later,
Rudolph himself scored the winning
goal.

Errors, Walks, Wild Pitches Help
Lynchburg Outscore Generals, 10-7

conducive to good pitching. Phil
Sharp, the Generals’ starter Friday,
will testify to this. He came on the
short end of a 10-7 score.

Sharp gave up five walks in eight
and two-thirds innings. Three of the
walks came in the first, when the
Hornets got to Sharp for three runs
on no hits and two errors.

As it turned out, these three were
the eventual margin of victory.

Lynchburg added two runs each
in the fifth and sixth innings, one
in the eighth on a single and three
wild pitches, and two in the ninth.

W&L got one in the first, two in
the second, two in the seventh, and
two in the ninth.

Lynchburg only managed four hits
off Sharp and his successor, Brice
Gamber, but five walks, one balk,
four wild pitches, and five errors led
to W&L’s downfall.

Russ Homers

The Generals’ Jim Russ got the
biggest hit of the day a seventh-
inning home run with Bobby Wil-
liams on base. Ned Hobbs’ triple in
the first also accounted for a run.

“We'd have won on good pitching,”
coach Joe Lyles commented after the
game. “It wasn’t his (Sharp’s) own
fault. But he kept the ball low.”

Sharp threw 144 pitches, fighting
wind and the thermometer all the
way. He was also picked off third
base.

controlled the ball from then on
as they ran out the clock.

Those who last scored for W&L

‘Lefty’ Gomez
Works With
W&L Pitchers

Washington and Lee’s pitching
staff benefitted from the Valley
Sports Show over the weekend to
the extent of some personal coach-
ing from an ex-pro, former New
York Yankee star “Lefty” Gomez.

Gomez, traveling for Wilson
Sporting Goods, spoke at the show
and was introduced by W&L coach
Joe Lyles. Sunday he came up to
Wilson Field to work with some
of Lyle’s pitchers, especially Phil
Sharp and Brice Gamber.

“It was so cold we all turned
blue,” Lyles said, “but I think the
coaching the boys got helped. I
was very happy and thankful that a
man of his talent should help.”

Gomez, a lefthanded power in
the American League for many
years, later coached in the Yankee
farm system. He currently travels
some 93,000 miles a year for Wilson.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Tuesday Edition’s Amendment

(Continued from page 2)

Why should the press, which theoretically represents the
students who elected the EC members, not be allowed to at-
tend legislative meetings, and why should we have to be given
“permission” to attend meetings, when our attendance is
generally recognized as being our inherent right?

Those who do not feel that such an amendment is in order
raise the cry that the question of press representation should be
voted on a “year to year” basis. We ask our opponents why
the campus press should be denied the right it has to attend
meetings which affect every student?

We don’t feel that our plea will fall on deaf ears, and we
do not believe that we are requesting changes for the sake of
change. Our motives, we assure our readers, have been well
thought out and have been presented for your acceptance or
rejection. We invite comment from students, and we pledge
that we will accept your views in the same good faith that you
accept ours.

Spring Dances A Success

The Tuesday Edition is pleased to note the success of the
past Spring Dance Set. Thanks to the co-operation between
the fraternities and the Dance Board, there were no conflict-
ing combo parties with the concerts, and attendance at the
evening concerts was excellent.

The idea of having two concerts in place of the usual dances
proved to be quite successful. We hope that this practice will
continue to be followed.

Steve Galef, dance board president, is to be congratulated
for an excellent job in planning dance sets this year. We hope
that the dance sets next year will be as well planned and suc-
cessful as they have been this year.

Tower, who was elected to the

“Goldwater Republican,” is present-
ly recognized as one of the most
able spokesman of the Conservative
cause.

Tower was the surprise of Texas
when he was elected in 1960. The
Wall Street Journal had said before
the election if Tower won, the Re-
publican Party in Texas would be
put 10 years ahead.

Tower, a former professor of po-
litical science at Midwestern Univer-
sity in Wichita Falls, comes to the
W&L campus under the sponsorship
of the Young Republican Club.

a greater responsibility to provide
the student body with better enter-
tainment.”

Frank Young, next year’s presi-
dent of the Dance Board, was shock-
ed when he learned of the faculty
decision.

He stated, “The faculty did not
give the student body and the IFC
a chance to solve its own problems.
The IFC was making an effort to
cooperate with the Dance Board. An
agreement had been reached and
the excellent attendance at Springs
Dances showed that a solution was
possible.”

Young further added that he be-
lieved that the Faculty action will
not help increase the attendance at
dance sets but will do more harm
than good.
