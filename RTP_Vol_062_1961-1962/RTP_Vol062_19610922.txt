W&L To Enter
‘College Bowl’
TV Program

Washington and Lee University
has been invited to compete on the
General Electric College Bowl tele-
vicion program, seen during the
school year Sundays on CBS.

Washington and Lee’s team will
appear on November 12 against the
current defending champion of the
quiz-game program. Among possible
opponents for Washington and Lee
are Pomona College, Washington
University of St. Louis, Hood Col-
lege, and Amherst College.

Should Washington and Lee win,
it would next face University of
North Dakota on the following Sun-
day. A team may win five times be-
fore being retired as an undefeated
champion.

The program originates live from
New York, and Washington and
Lee’s four-member team and coach
will travel to New York on No-
vember 11.

President Fred C. Cole has named
a member of his administrative
staff to set up a selection process
by which Washington and Lee will
pick its team of quickest thinkers
with the most facts. An official
team “coach” will be named later.

Washington and Lee enjoyed con-
siderable success several years ago
in the radio version of the pro-
gram carried on the NBC network.
In 1953, its “varsity scholars” won
six times before losing, and in 1955
a Washington and Lee team won
three matches before meeting de-
feat.

Allen Ludden, who was quiz mas-
ter on the radio show, continues as
the question man on the popular
TV program.

W&L Board Of

The election of Joseph Earle Bir-
nie, Atlanta banker, and Lewis F.
Powell, Jr., Richmond attorney, to
the Board of Trustees of Washing-
ton and Lee University was an-
nounced in July by James R. Caskie
of Lynchburg, rector of the board.

Birnie and Powell will assume
their new duties at the board’s next
regular meeting in October, Caskie
said. Both are alumni of Washington
and Lee, and both have been active
in support of education.

Central Switchboard Installed;
More Efficient Service Promised

A new switchboard system de-
signed to provide improved tele-
phone service for Washington and
Lee University was put into oper-
ation here late in August.

Known in the communications
trade as a P.A.B.X. system, the
switchboard, other control equip-
ment, and connecting lines to some
130 telephones throughout the uni-
versity were installed over the sum-
mer by the Lexington Telephone
Company.

The system enables a central oper-
ator to take all calls to Washington
and Lee and connect calling parties
with up to 100 extension numbers.

From 8 am. to 5 p.m. on weekdays,
all Washington and Lee incoming
calls will be answered by the uni-
versity operator on Lexington num-
ber HO 3-2181. Special provisions for
incoming calls nights, Sundays, and
holidays are being worked out. The
next Lexington telephone directory
will list a limited number of Wash-
ington and Lee numbers which can
be dialed directly after normal
working hours.

The new system enables Wash-
ington and Lee employees to make
interoffice calls by dialing a three-
digit number directly. Calls to the
outside are also dialed directly, by

dialing “9” first and then the Lex-
ington or other number.

James W. Whitehead, assistant to
the president, stressed that the new
system would enable the University
to provide more efficient service,
particularly to outside parties call-
ing Washington and Lee.

He said the operator would assist
in directing calls to proper univer-
sity offices for persons seeking var-
ious kinds of information. In many
cases, the operator will be able to
provide certain information herself,
eliminating the need for further
connections.

Whitehead said the operator may
be helpful in locating persons for
important long distance or other
calls. In effect, the operator will pro-
vide an answering service for all
Washington and Lee numbers.

“Tf a professor knows he will be
away from town, he can inform the
operator and she will be able to pass
on this information to his callers,”
Whitehead explained.

Operators for the switchboard are
Mrs. Josephine Ewers and Mrs.
Edna May Kirkpatrick.

The new system has brought a 36
per cent increase in the number of
telephones at Washington and Lee.
Previously, there were 83 telephones
in use on the campus, compared
with the present 130.

Fraternities Pledge 83 Percent

 

Of Freshman Class

Troubs Meet,
Hold Tryouts
Sunday Night

The Troubadours, Washington and
Lee’s theatre group, get their 1960-61
season underway in a hurry this
week.

There will be an organizational
meeting in the theatre Sunday night
at 7, followed by tryouts for the
first Troub play, Boy Meets Girl,
by Bella and Samuel Spewak.
Those inerested may try out on
Monday and Tuesday night from
7 to 9 in the theatre.

Freshmen interested in acting, or
work on scenery, lighting, business
management, or publicity are invited
to the organizational meeting Sun-
day night.

Dr. Cecil Jones, faculty director,
reminded all voting members to be
on hand Sunday night. Members-at-
large to the Troub executive com-
mittee will be elected then.

Boy Meets Girl offers opportuni-
ties for both novice and experienced
actors. There are 14 male parts to be
cast, including several which can
certainly be played by people with-
out previous experience, according
to Troub publicity director Andy
Leonard.

The play itself is a farce set in
the 1930’s which George Abbott
described as “the best play which
has yet appeared about Hollywood.”
Copies are available at the reserve
desk in the library and may be read
there prior to auditions.

 

Dance Board Sells Record
Number of Dance Plans;
760 Sold For 1961-62

The Dance Board announced to-
day that a record number of Dance
Plans were sold in the registration
lines on Monday and Tuesday. Ap-
proximately 790 plans were sold
for the 1961-62 season.

Steve Galef, Dance Board presi-
dent said that he wished to thank
the students for their excellent re-
sponse to the Dance Board’s new
plans and that he will do every-
thing possible to make this an out-
standing year for the dance sets.
He reported that the entertainment
and procedure at Openings will only
begin to show some of the Dance
Board’s new plans.

Those students who have not yet
purchased Dance Plans and still de-
sire to do so may get them from
members of the Dance Board in the
Co-op next week. The purchase of
a Dance Plan can save a student
more than $35 during the year.

Students who have signed for a
Dance Plan but who have not yet
paid for it may do so by October 6.
They can make out a $25 check
payable to the Washington and Lee
Dance Board and mail it to Box 458,
Lexington, or pay a member of the
Dance Board who will be in the Co-

 

op next week.

Galef estimated that close to 900 |

plans must be sold in order to fully '

260 Men

By KEN LANE

A total of 260 freshmen and 5 transfers pledged to W&L’s
18 fraternities this fall, marking a rise of 18 in the number of
pledges over that of the 1960 Rush Week.

The sharp rise startled IFC officials, who felt that last year’s
decline might have indicated a lack of interest in fraternity

 

VFIC Board
To Visit W&L

Washington and Lee University
will be host Saturday to the Board
of Trustees of the Virginia Founda-
tion for Independent Colleges and
the presidents of the other eleven
member institutions.

Twenty-five leaders of Old Do-
minion business and industry will
join college presidents in a day-long
program aimed at better acquaint-
ing trustees with the various col-
leges their foundation supports.

The Washington and Lee event is
the first such on-campus gathering of
the foundation’s board since the
VFIC was established in 1953. The
trustees hope to visit other campus-
es in subsequent years.

At Washington and Lee, they will
have an opportunity to tour the
campus and buildings and attend
regular class sessions. At luncheon in
Evans Dining Hall, the trustees
and presidents will hear brief talks
by Dean William W. Pusey, III,
of the College, Dean Lewis W.
Adams of the School of Commerce
and Administration, Dean Charles P.
Light, Jr., of the School of Law,
Dean of Students Frank J. Gilliam,
and student body President Andrew
McThenia of Alderson, W. Va.

The visitors will be honored guests
at the 2 p.m. football game between
Washington and Lee and Hampden-
Sydney College, also a member of
the VFIC.

The Virginia Foundation for Inde-
pendent Colleges was established in
1953 to seek financial support for
the state’s privately-supported col-
leges from state business and indus-
try and from other corporations
doing business in Virginia. In its
first year, three contributors gave
$22,000; last year, 573 contributors
gave $680,700 to be divided among
members for operating expenses. In
nine years, 2,322 supporters have
contributed $2,994,628.

A 24-member Board of Trustees
directs the activities of the Foun-
dation, assisted by the presidents of
the participating colleges, and a
small full-time administrative staff.

Stuart T. Saunders, president of
the Norfolk and Western Railway
Co., is chairman of the board of
trustees. President William F. Quil-
lian, Jr., of Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College serves as the founda-
tion’s president.

Member _ institutions
Bridgewater College, Emory and
Henry College, Hampden-Sydney
College, Hollins College, Lynchburg
College, Mary Baldwin College,
Randolph-Macon College, Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, Roanoke
College, Sweet Briar College, the
University of Richmond, and Wash-
ington and Lee University.

include

k membership.

The percentage of the freshman
class that pledged rose from last
year’s 78 per cent to 83 per cent
this year, with a 1961 freshman class
of 315.

Delta Tau Delta led the fraterni-
ties numerically with a pledge class
of 25. PiKA had the second largest
number, 24; Sigma Nu and SPE were
third and fourth, with 22 and 21 re-
spectively.

PiKA and Sigma Phi Epsilon
showed the most noticeable rise over
last year, each gaining eleven more
pledges than last year. Of the eight-
een fraternities, however, only half
have larger pledge classes this year
than last year.

On the other extreme, SAE and
KA underwent the sharpest numeri-
cal drop. SAE, which had the highest
number last year, went from 22 to
’ pledges; KA dropped from 18 to

After last year’s unexpected de-
cline in pledging, this year has been
greatly encouraging. As can be seen
by the statistics below, the outlook
at the beginning of this year was not
bright.

Deferred rush will begin four

weeks after Rush Week. Eligible for
the program are 55 freshmen.

Bob Doenges, president of the In-
terfraternity Council, reported that
the 1961 Rush Week went exception-
ally well, despite the two days period
of rainy weather. Doenges maintain-
ed that “as of yet, no formal com-
plaint has been issued; things ran
pretty smoothly.”

Since the main campus avenue
has been cut off by construction
work, a new parking system was
inaugurated. Fraternities were as-
signed definite parking areas to min-

Moot Court Head Named

John Petzold, senior law student
from Augusta, Maine, has been
named chairman of the W&L Moot
Court Team. Serving as his associ-
ates will be James T. Tate, Jr., law
senior from Richmond, Va., Richard
L. Rose, second year law student
from Allenhurst, N. J., and William
H. Clark, Jr., second year law stu-
dent from Richmond, Va.

The team has begun preparation
for regional competition later this
fall. In the first round arguments,
the squad will face delegations from
law schools in Virginia, South Car-
olina, North Carolina and West Vir-
ginia.

The National Moot Court Compe-
tition is sponsored annually by the
Young Lawyers Committee of the
Association of the Bar of the City

 

 

of New York.

Memo To:

The 1961 Pledge Class

If they follow form, no more than 75 per cent of the Class
of 1965 will pledge a fraternity this weekend. Those who do
take upon themselves the responsibility of defining anew the
role of the fraternity system in the life of Washington and

Lee.

The fraternities must make the goals of the University
their own. If they limit the scope of their activity to social life,
they are giving up their opportunity to help shape the academic
part of school life and to further improve their role in publica-

tions and student government.

We offer these challenges to the fraternities at Washington
and Lee, and particularly to their new pledge classes:

Fraternities must improve their academic standing. A boy
being rushed by a fraternity is never desired as much for his
classroom talents as for his social face, or his athletic abilities.
Each house must make their academic standing a matter of

more than joking concern.

Fraternity expenses must be brought down. Substantial belt-
tightening seems to be in order for most houses. Further, most
board bills at fraternities shot up when freshmen were taken
out of the house dining rooms and put in the Commons. The
Administration, which was relieved of the problem of feeding
most students here for many years by the fraternities, owes
it to them now to help work out some central buying system
for food to help bring down their board expenses.

In publications and student government the fraternities
must prove they are more interested in real ability and real
attainment than they are in the number of offices they can
push their members into. It is more important that we have a
good Calyx, or Ring-tum Phi, or that we are given intelligent
leadership in student government than that a fraternity brother
of ours is a Big Man On Campus.

There has been little evidence of discontent with the fra-
ternity system at Washington and Lee, but if these challenges
are not met here in the next decade the fraternities will have
dug themselves a common grave.

Welcome To The VFIC

The student body joins the administration in welcoming
the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Foundation of Indepen-
dent Colleges to the Washington and Lee campus.

The VFIC raised $680,700 for its members last year.

We who are benefiting now from the foundation’s efforts
are grateful. Future generations of Virginia college students will
probably benefit even more as the VFIC grows.

 

Seven More Professors Get
Glenn Grants For Extra Study

Seven additional Washington and
Lee University professors were
awarded grants-in-aid this summer
totalling $1,169.76 through the
school’s John M. Glenn Program
for faculty research and study.

The new grants bring to 18 the
number of participants under the
1961 Glenn program. Earlier, 11
other professors were given $4,419
in grants whose individual stipends
ranged as high at $900.

The new grants went to:

Dr. Jay D. Cook, Jr., associate
professor of accounting, for partici-
pation in a faculty seminar in ac-
counting at Williams College.

Prof. Paxton Davis, associate pro-
fessor of journalism, for travel in-
volved in preparing a book-length
account of General David Hunter’s
raid on the Valley of Virginia dur-
ing the Civil War.

Dr. Louis W. Hodges, assistant
professor of religion, for study at
Duke University on theological in-
fluences in race relations.

Dr. Cecil D. Jones, Jr., assistant
professor of drama, for study of

 

 

current trends in drama production
in New York City.

Dr. Marion M. Junkin, professor
of fine arts, for summer study at
various art museums in Baltimore,
Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.

Dr. Leland W. McCloud, associate
professor of commerce, for partici-
pation in a faculty seminar in sim-
ulation and management games at
Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Dr. Charles F. Phillips, Jr., as-
sistant professor of economics, for
research and writing in theory of
government regulation of business.

Most grants were for summer use,
although they were not restricted
to this period. The John M. Glenn
Program is endowed by a gift of
$120,000 from the estate of the late
philanthropist who was an official
of the Russell Sage Foundation and
an 1879 alumnus of Washington and
Lee.

In addition to the 18 professors
aided through the Glenn program,
four others are sharing in research
funds made available through the
Research Council of the University
Center in Virginia.

Law Student Finds Old bea

A holograph letter written by Dr. | tronomy,’
Dr. Ruffner.

Henry Ruffner, president of Wash-
ington College from 1836 to 1848,
has been found among a collection
of old letters purchased by a Wash-
ington and Lee University law stu-
dent.

Lewis Leigh, Jr., of Chantilly, says
he will give the letter to Washing-
ton and Lee “if they promise not
to bury it somewhere in the arc-
hives.”

Written shortly after Dr. Ruffner
became president of the college, the
letter is addressed to a Colonel As-
pinwall, American consul in London.
It thanks Aspinwall for his assist-
ance in obtaining “A Catalogue of
7,385 Stars” from a London source
for the college’s library.

University librarian Henry Cole-
man says no book by that title is
now in the library, but he believes
a three-volume set, “Vince’s As-

 

is the item referred to by

“If you add up all the stars cata-
logued in the Vince volumes, they
come to approximately 7,385,” Cole-
man explains. “And ‘Vince’s As-
tronomy’ was published in London
in 1814.”

Leigh, a graduate of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and a freshman
law student at Washington and Lee,
collects old letters and documents.
The Ruffner letter was among a
number purchased recently during
a New England trip.

“I bought it because it had the
Lexington postmark on it,” Leigh
said. “I didn’t know until later that
it was written by a former president
of the school.”

A campus astronomer says that
“Vince’s Astronomy” was quite an
important book in its day.

sion, Dr. William W. Pusey, TI, Dean
of the College, announced today.

were Edwin M. Curley, instructor
in philosophy, and Jay Laurence

President Cole Challenges
Students In Opening Talk

The “privileged few” who are di-
rectly associated with Washington
and Lee must assume a relatively
great individual responsibility, Dr.
Fred C. Cole told the student body
and faculty at the Opening Assembly
last Wednesday.

“We must earn the right that has
been given us through the oppor-
tunity of an association with Wash-
ington and Lee,” Dr. Cole said.

Pointing out the “threat to our
future as free men,” Dr. Cole warned
that we cannot be indifferent.

“Our hope for the future depends
on the kind of men who will make
the decisions that are the products of
minds of intelligence and under-
standing rather than those of ignor-
ance and stupidity.”

Stating that a college education
can help an individual “toward an
understanding of the complex forces
which affect us as individuals and
as nations,” Dr. Cole concluded,
“In a real sense, higher education
is related to our very survival on
this planet.”

“As a university, as a student
body, and as a faculty, we can pro-
vide leadership and service to our
fellowmen and to our nation,” Dr.
Cole said.

“We must earn the right to the
pride we take in being selective
and small in number. Our achieve-
ments must be great far beyond our
size and number.”

 

Haslett Awarded Fulbright
To Study In Germany

David W. Haslett, Washington
and Lee University 1961 graduate
from Hickory, N. C., has been
awarded a Fulbright fellowship for
graduate study in Germany this|
year.

Haslett, 21, a philosophy major,

 

will continue his work in this field
at the University of Freiburg.

Two other Washington and Lee
students, James A. Vann, III, of |
Birmingham, and John A. Broaddus, |
Jr., of Richmond, were announced |
last spring as Fulbright winners for |
study in Auctria and France.

The Fulbright program is admin-
istered by the State Department and |
involves the exchange of students |
with certain foreign countries. Funds |
used to finance the exchanges are)
part of foreign currencies or credits |
owned or owed to the Treasury of
the United States.

Approximately 900 Fulbright fel- |
lowships are granted each year |
among American college students. |

NOTICE

Mr. Whitehead requests that no
students park between the R. E. Lee
Church and the President’s House
on either side of Nelson Street to-
morrow. The Lexington Police De-
partment will rope off the restrict-
ed area, which is being reserved
for the trustees of the Virginia
Foundation of Independent Colleges. |

ment of classical languages to fill a
vacancy created by the July death
of Dr. Earl L. Crum.

The appointment of these men
brings the total of 1961-1962 faculty
additions to 18.

Curley, a B.A. graduate of Lafay-
ette College, is working toward his
Ph.D. in philosophy at Duke Uni-
versity. He is married and has one
child.

Taylor comes to Washington and
Lee from New York University
where he received his A.B. and is
completing work on his doctorate.

The two visiting lecturers in clas-
sical languages are Lexington area
ministers. Dr. Bennetch, pastor of
Fairfield and Alone Mill Lutheran
churches, received his Th.D. from
Dallas Theological Seminary, where
he was later on the faculty. He did
his undergraduate work at Muhlen-
berg College. Dr. Weir, director of
the Methodist Wesley Foundation in
Lexington, received his Ph.D. in
June from the University of Edin-
burgh. He is also a graduate of
Emory University in Atlanta.

Both men will teach part-time in
classics along with a third visiting
lecturer in that department, Peter
D. Fyfe, who was appointed this
summer. Fyfe is a member of the
faculty at Virginia Military Institute.

Comments On Text Book Prices,

Combos, And Assorted Subjects

By STEVE HENRY

“A book is a journey,” said a
placard mounted across a bulletin
board in a grammar school classroom
where we spent most of our early
years.

In case you do not know it al-
ready, a book is also a goldmine,
especially if you happen to own
the textbook concession at a small
liberal arts school in Virginia.

We are not going to name any
names or places, but will offer only
one candid comment: prices are up-
stairs at the downstairs.

There is a certain paradox in the
fact that a small textbook cost more
than a large novel.

We are not going to be so ridicu-
lous as to compare the operators of
the unnamed book shop with the
Jesse James gang.

After all, both Frank and Jesse
used guns in their robberies.

These are the times that try men’s
wallets.

* * *

While on a financial kick, we feel
it necessary to inform the reader
that there is one good buy left in
the modern South.

In a certain Southern town which
we know well, there is a combo that
calls itself “Jo-Jo and the Night-
Crawlers.”

The group plays what we call
questionable _rock-and-roll—ques-
tionable because you are never ex-
actly sure what kind of music Jo-Jo
and his boys are playing.

After a couple of hours, providing
that you have had enough to drink,
you finally decide that Jo-Jo is
playing rock-and-roll.

 

In fact, if you have had enough
to drink, Jo-Jo sounds like Ray
Charles. (One of liquor’s greatest
assets is its ability to make bad
combos sound good, putrid jokes
seem funny, and horrible girls look
lovable.)

This is all off the subject, how-
ever.

As we said earlier, we brought up
Jo-Jo just to make a point, namely
that you can get your money’s
worth on something.

Jo-Jo is the last of the big-time
cheap commodities. For forty dol-
lars, he plays four hours. Pass the
hat and he’ll go two more.

When you consider the fact that
the Night Crawlers know the Hot-
Nut song, then you realize that
Jo-Jo is a super bargain.

Beginning with a $200 budget, you
can get Jo-Jo, plus $160 of liquor,
which is enough to make any party
good.

That’s the point of the whole thing,
anyway.

Perhaps significant, perhaps not,
is the fact that this first week of
school was a week of colossal world-
wide failures.

Maris failed to hit 60, Hurricane
Esther failed to do much damage,
and Dag failed to make it home.

An Oriential philosopher of con-
siderable prominence says:

“School year bred in failure, end
in failure.”

Which is one of the most unorigi-
nal bits of philosophy ever offered
up, and maybe one of the most pro-
phetic for some of us.

 

Gentlemen Crammed, Then Beat
Other Teams In Radio Quiz

By JOHN KIRKLEY

In January of 1954, Washington
and Lee University was selected by
the National Broadcasting Company
to be on the Feb. 18 broadcast of
the “College Quiz Bowl.”

The show was considered one of
the most demanding on raido. How-
ever, the rewards were significant.
The winning team during each pro-
gram received $500 to donate to any
worthwhile campus organization. A
Minnesota team had previously won
$4,000 before being defeated.

Six W&L students were chosen
to compete for positions on the four-
man team. The four selected were
Harold Quinn, Fred lLackmann,
Hank Turner, and Bob Paxton.
These men, and an alternate, Norm
Dobyns, “crammed” for several
weeks before their scheduled match
with Smith College.

Fortunately for our peace of mind,
the W&L team defeated the ladies
from Smith by a score of 180 to
110. The program, recorded in Wash-
ington Hall, contained such ques-
tions as “Who were Mallory and
Irvine and how did they make
headline news in 1924?”

The W&L grappled mentally with
scholars from Chicago on Feb. 25
in their second Quiz Bow! duel. The

 

score this time was a resounding
200 to 150 victory for Washington
and Lee. The prize money had
reached $1,000, and the next oppon-
ent was Princeton.

This time the broadcast was from
a quite crowed Washington Chapel.
Once again the gentlemen showed
their superiority in downing the
boys from Nassau 180 to 140.

In their fouth week the W&L team
defeated Barnard College 190 to
165. Incidentally, it was just before
this show that an awed Barnard girl
exclaimed, “Harold Quinn! We’ve
heard about you!” The fifth and
final victory of the Washington and
Lee brain trust was over iPttsburgh
by a score of 260 to 85.

Finally on March 26 of 1954, the
W&L team was defeated 205 to 130
by Syracuse University. The $2,500
that they had won in prize money
was used, according to their wish,
to set up a memorial scholarship in
honor of John Higgins Williams.

 

NOTICE

For all students in the under-
graduate school interested in trying
out for the College Bowl team a
meeting will be held Monday at
7:30 p.m. in the journalism lecture
room in Payne Hall.

Soccer Practice Gets Underway

With 50 Hopefuls Reporting

Over 50 boys turned out for fall
soccer practice Wednesday, includ-
ing a group of talented freshmen
and a small corps. of experienced
veterans.

Coach Joe Lyles still faces a major
rebuilding job this fall, after losing
several 1960 starters through either
the graduation or fail-out route.

Six starters from last year’s squad
are gone, including standouts Frank
Smith and Steve Hawkins.

Lyles is particularly hurting at the
wing and halfback positions.

“We lost a center-forward, both
wings, a center-half, and our goalie,”
said Lyles. “We’ve got a long way
to go.”

Returnees from last year include
co-captains Harry Preston and Dun-
lop Ecker, Bill Outman, Jim Starkey,

Washington and Lee opens at
Pfeiffer next week, leaving time for
only six more pre-season practice
sessions.

Tigers Offer
W&L Stern

Opening Test

By ED NORTON

The Washington and Lee Gen-
erals open the 1961 season at home
tomorrow afternoon against the Tig-
ers of Hampden-Sydney. Kickoff
time will be at 2 o’clock at Wilson
Field.

Coach Lee McLaughlin has rated
the Tigers as potentially the most
dengerous team the Generals will
foce this year. “They will really
went to get us,” he points out,
“ond they will have had ten more
yrectice sessions when we meet.”
Last year the Generals came from
behind in the last quarter to win
14-7, and since both teams have
almost the same personnel the con-
test should repeat as a toss up.

The Generals main strength this
year will be depth and experience,
McLaughlin was able to shuttle three
full teams in and out of last years
games and plans to do the same in
1961; “There’s no doubt about it;
our depth won ball games for us
last year,” he admits.

Returning from last year’s unde-
feated, once-tied team will be 28
lettermen, including 19 seniors, most
of whom will be playing their
fourth season of varsity ball. Also
to the Generals advantage will be
what McLaughlin considers the
finest group of sophomores he has
seen since he came to Washington
and Lee.

Generally, this combination of ex-
perience, depth, and promising young
talent make the Generals chances
to better last year’s 8-0-1 record
extremely bright.

The Generals will operate tomor-
from their double barreled “GO-T”
offense, the combination of “T” and
the single wing attack that pro-
duced 28 touchdowns and nearly
3,000 yards total offense last year.
McLaughlin expects to base his of-
fense around the breakaway threats
of senior fullback Doug Martin and

Bob Pagano, Dave Knight, Lou! Openings Vice Presidents Sunday speedster halfback Jim Hickey.

Frosh Mentor
Praises Spirit,
Laments Size

Speed and spirit, a pair of inval-
uable aids to any football team, are
the strengths of Washington and Lee
University’s freshman grid club.

However, the third

man on the Baby Generals’ roster |
weighs more then 190 pounds, and_/|
these “heavyweights” are in a min-|
ority.

But to new freshman coach Dana
Swan, W&L’s speed and spirit put it
two steps closer to the winner’s
circle.

After only a w2ck’s practice, Swan,
who came to W&L this year from
Swarthmore College, is detecting
signs of a winning ball team. But
mind you, he isn’t predicting his
squad will be a powerhouse.

“Our offense looked good in our
first scrimmage Tuesday,” Swan said.
“We've got three backs with break-
away potential, a couple of bull-
dozing fullbacks and a trio of ade-
quate quarterbacks. Most of these
boys need more experience, how-
ever, before they become good foot-
ball players.”

Swan also praised the offensive
line, but he quickly added:

“Although our linemen’s initial
charges were good, we still have to
teach them to hold their blocks
longer.”

The Baby Generals haven’t begun
their defensive work, but Swan is
optimistic about their abilities to
stop their opponents.

Again citing Tuesday’s scrimmage
Swan said, “Our offense is way
ahead of our defense, but the boys
showed a fair amount of defensive
talent.”

The new coach is leaning toward
a running rather than a passing at-
tack. This is contrary to the usual
W&L offense, but the injury of his
two most experienced ends and the
lack of an outstanding passer have
forced Swan to make the change.

Tigers’ 2-6 Record Last Year Deceiving

(Continued on page 4)
Sophomore Stuart Yoffe, leading
scorer on last year’s freshman team,
should provide additional long range
power. In tomorrow’s closely match-
ed contest, the long gainer could be
the deciding factor. Halfback Jim
Russ and Charlie Gummey and full-
back Tommy Keesee provide added
scoring potential.

Directing the offense will be vet-
eran quarterback Steve Suttle. With
two years of first unit experience
behind him, Suttle does everything
well. He is especially effective when
operating from the “spread offense,”
for he has good running power, and
his passing ability has earned the
respect of opposing defenses. Back-
ing him will be play maker Robin
Wood, and two dangerous passers,
Chuck Lane and John McDaniel.

Up front, the Generals’ line, al-
though neither big or fast, has plen-

ty of experience. Top rated veter-
ans include centers Terry Fohs and
Jerry Hyatt, guards Tommy Good-
win, Barton Dick, and George Cru-
ger, tackles Bill Wheeler and Bob
Payne, and ends Ned Hobbs, Dan
Blaine and Lanny Butler. Center
Mike Sheffey, guard Charlie Savage,
and ends Mike Jenkins and Ed Croft
head an impressive list of sophomore
linemen.

Heading the defensive unit will be
Washington and Lee’s Little All-
American Terry Fohs. The Generals
gave up only 46 points last year,
less than a touchdown a game, and
with the wealth of depth and ex-
perience, the defense should prove
to be even tighter.

Coach Stokeley Fulton’s Tigers
will be empting to rebound from
last year’s 2-6 season and to re-
venge the 14-6 loss to the Generals.

But the Tiger’s record is deceiving,

 

for all eight contests were decided
by 10 points or less. With eight
regulars returning, the first unit
should be solid, but depth will prove
to be a problem for the Tigers. The
major weakness is the quarterback
position where Stewart Shelton is
the only experienced operator.

Hampden-Sydney’s offense calls
for the split-T formation and a
heavy passing attack. Coach Fulton
feels that he has a scoring combi-
nation in quarterback Shelton and
Bobby Saylor. The Tigers have been
working hard to develop the scoring
punch they lacked last season. “Of-
fense is our big concern right now,”
Fulton reports. “We hope to have
an offense that’s capable of scoring
against short-yardage defenses. We
hope we’re not going to give up the
ball inside our opponent’s 10-yard
line like we did last year.”

Other strong points on the Tiger

eleven are guard junior lettermen
Bill Heinzer and Otis Bradley.
Hampden-Sydney also has a stand-
out performer in center Bill Sale,
an All-Virginia small college selec-
tion. In addition to Saylor at end,
senior Tony Rucker, junior Joey
Viar, and sophomore Richard Cralle
make this the Tiger’s strongest po-
sition.
Summary

The Generals’ strength lies in
their depth and experience. In all
positions they are two deep in let-
termen, and in some cases they are
three deep. The only weakness lies
in the lack of overall team size and
speed.

The Tigers first unit has plenty of
experience, but Coach Fulton has no
real depth to depend on. They have
good speed in both the backfield
and line, but they are physically
smaller than last year’s team.

New Freshman Coach Swan
Comes Here From Swarthmore

Washington and Lee University’s
1961 freshman football team is un-
der the direction of a_ full-time
coach for the first time in eight

years.
Athletic Director E. P. “Cy”
Twombly announced today that

Dana W. Swan, II, of Swarthmore,
Pa., has joined the Generals’ coach-
ing staff as a freshman football coach
and instructor in physical educa-
tion.

Swan will coach a frosh squad of
some 30 players through a tough
seven-game schedule against mili-
tary, prep, and junior college op-
position.

A Marine veteran and a 1957
graduate of Swarthmore College,
Swan was varsity backfield coach
and junior varsity coach at Swarth-
more before accepting the W&L
post. He is 29 years old.

“Under our program here, we must
give special attention to the develop-
ment of our freshmen players in
order to sustain the varsity squad
in future years,” varsity head coach
Lee McLaughlin pointed out.

competition at Washington and Lee,
but for the past three years, Coach
McLaughlin has chosen to keep his
freshmen together as a team and let
them play their own schedule.

“We feel the six or seven games
of playing experience will be far
more valuable than the limited serv-
ice they might see with the varsity,”
McLaughlin said. “With a full time
freshman coach, the experience will
be even more valuable.”

Since Washington and Lee adopted
its so-called “amateur” athletic pro-
gram in 1954, freshman and junior
varsity football teams have been
coached by part-time staff members,
usually students in the law school
who played football at Washington
and Lee or other institutions.

Bill King, former University of
Virginia quarterback, will assist
Swan with the 1961 freshmen, along
with Dick White, a regular tackle
for the Generals in 1958 and 1959.
Both are law students.

Last year’s freshman team which
King helped coach turned in a 3-3

ONCE MORE, UNTO THE BREACH

With this installment I begin my eighth year of writing columns
for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as fine a bunch of men
as you would meet in a month of Sundays—loyal, true, robust,
windswept, forthright, tattooed—in short, precisely the kind
of men you would expect them to be if you were familiar with
the cigarettes they make—and I hope you are—for Marlboro,
like its makers, is loyal, true, robust, windswept, forthright,
tattooed.

There is, however, one important difference between Marl-
boro and its makers. Marlboro has a filter and the makers do
not—except of course for Windswept T. Sigafoos, Vice President
in charge of Media Research. Mr. Sigafoos does have a filter.
I don’t mean that Mr. Sigafoos personally has a filter. What I
mean is that he has a filter in his swimming pool at his home in
Fairbanks, Alaska. You might think that Fairbanks is rather
an odd place for Mr. Sigafoos to live, being such a long distance

   

ate

from the Marlboro home office in New York City. But it should

be pointed out that Mr. Sigafoos is not required to be at work
until 10 A.M.

But I digress. This column, I say, will take up questions of
burning interest to the academic world—like “Should French
conversation classes be conducted in English?” and “Should
students be allowed to attend first hour classes in pajamas and
robes?” and “Can a student of 18 find happiness with an eco-
nomics professor of 90?”

Because many of you are new to college, especially freshmen,
perhaps it would be well in this opening column to start with
campus fundamentals. What, for example, does “Alma Mater”
mean? Well, sir, “Alma Mater” is Latin for “send money”’,

What does “Dean” mean? Well, sir, “Dean” is Latin for
“don’t get caught’’.

What does “dormitory” mean? Well, sir, “dormitory” is
Latin for “bed of pain’.

Next, let us discuss student-teacher relationships. In college
the keynote of the relationship between student and teacher is
informality. When you meet a teacher on campus, you need
not salute. Simply tug your forelock. If you are bald and have
no forelock, a low curtsey will suffice. In no circumstances
should you polish a teacher’s car or sponge and press his suit.
It is, however, permissible to worm his dog.

With the President of the University, of course, your relation-
ship will be a bit more formal. When you encounter the Presi«
dent, fling yourself prone on the sidewalk and sing loudly:

“Prexy is wise
Prexy is true
Prexy has eyes
Of Lake Louise blue.”

As you can see, the President of the University is called
“Prexy”. Similarly, Deans are called “Dixie”. Professors are
called “Proxie”’. Housemothers are called “Hoxie Moxie”.
Students are called ““Amoebae’’.
