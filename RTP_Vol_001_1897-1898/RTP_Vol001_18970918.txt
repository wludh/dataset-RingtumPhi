Closing Sentences of President
-  ‘Wilson’s Address

The following are the closing sen-
tences of the inaugural address of
Hon, William L, Wilson . yesterday
at Washington and Lee:

If the South is to produce for her
own gervice, if she is to contribute,
as in days past, to the whole country
statesmen, Jegislutora and judges,
able to maintain her influence and
proper dignity as a great section of
the American union, her sons must
continue to give, a8 Mr. Blaine de-
clarea their fathers gave,“deep study
to the science of government,” and
if amid the harder conditions thut
confront them after leaving college
they ure no longer able to give that
study in the seclusion of their own
libraries, the proper founda:ions for
it must be luid in the schools of
learning.
Let it not be understood that such
atudies are designed to train recruits
for any partisan camp, still less to
mould them to the views of any
teacher. I am no disbeliever in
sturdy purtisunship that seeks
through political organization stbe
highest good of the country ; bus it
is to generate und develop the desire
aod the power of independent, orig-
inal res-arch, to fuster the habit aud
the ability of independent’ sjadg
ment; to. acquaint men with’ the
origin anc: historic growth of our
institutions, with the fundamental
principles of government, and sv to
enrich them with the ‘results of hu-
aan experience that they can decide
on this or that policy ae it may
atrengthen or weaken our <reedum,
this or that economic doctrine as it
may advance or impair the general
welfare ; above all to make them in-
telligent and strong leaders, rot ser-
vile und ill-informed followers of
public opinion or selfish beueficisries
of opular delusions, a
Thie ie not only to advance. the
cause of high education but the
cuuse of free govenoment,by helping
to retuin and to prepare for the ser-
vice of the country that “better
mind which is said to be growing
more and more alienated from the
highest of ull sciences und services
the government of it.” For such
education the examples and iospira-
tiuns are sll around ue ; nowhere
more than in the past history of this
commonwealth, or in the names as-
eociated with’ the origin and. past
history of this school.
We throw away the richest part of
our endowment if we do not bring
these examples and inepiratione tu
the education of our young men ; 1f
we do not mould into their very
etamina the patriotic principles of
those fathers and those founders
and those illustrious pupils oj the

siastic college spirit which is so
much needed to give our University
the prestige in athletics which is
rightfully its due.

Our past defeats are due more to
lack of proper support than to the
inefficiency of our teams, Our man-
agers, made timid by the lethargy
of the student body, have rightfully
refused the responsibility of obtain-
ing games at the risk of certain per-
sonal loss, Our teams need that
persistent encouragement, that up-

|hill enthusiasm which so. often is

able to pull victory out of defeat.
We are entering on an auspicious
season, Our football team will be
in a large part composed of the mem-
bers of last year’s team—a team
which so triumphantly broke the
links of a long chain of defeat, a
team which with that broken link
strongly riveted to the anchor of
‘hope, with strong reinforcements at’
hand, with an alert and capable man-
ager, with an able and experienced
captain, stands ready, with your as-
sixtance, to make a more glorious
campaign than any in the past.

Will you give this personal sup-
port? We expect it. Rouse your-
selves fellows. Open that pocket ;
opeh that heart. At practice and in|
