7 The Literary Societies.

Hardly ever has there been such
nterest shown in the Literary Socie-
ies as this year, as was evide.:ced
vy the enthusiastic meetings of last
jaturday night. Several new men
vere elected as members of the So-
ieties, but this was not all,

At about 9 o’clock a committee
ppeared in the Washington hall to
nvite its members to meet with the
Jraham-Lee’s in joint session, The
Washington society gladly accepted
he kind invitation and a treat was
n stoce for them, for it was the oc-
asion of..a), gl rification .. ia _the
iralam-Lees, "Several of” the
ilumni of that society hod cone up
o impart to the’ present members
ome glad tidings. In addition to
he alumni of the Graham-Lee, were
ilso President Wilson, Prof. More-
und and Prof. Vance of the Wash-
ngton: society. “The Graham-Lee
ilumni were ; Prof. Tucker, Prof:
Fraves, Rev. Mr. Leyburn, Mr.
John L. Campbell, Prof. Currell
ind Mr, John M. Glenn.

President Wilson stated the ob-
ect of the. meeting in a speech of a
ew minutes. He said that a few
veeks ago hewas. on an inspecting

lition of the two. society halls. It
1appened that he was in a’ party of
traham-Lee aiumni,and on the spot
hey began a movement to better

ciety and so had been interested in
the movement for securing funds
for the bettering of the Graham-Lee

-|hall. He was sure, however, that a

like movement among the alumni of
the Washington society would suc-
ceed, He said that a committee of
Graham-Lee society, consisting of
Messrs. Thomas 8. Purdie of New
York, Samuel J. Graham of Pitts-
burgh, and William C. Preston of
Richmond, had written to prominent
men of their old society, and that
they had been prompt and liberal in
their responses, He said that they
had asked for about $250 and that
he had already received about $110,
and still the letters were being heard
from. He was true to his society,
but was also a true friend to the
Washington and he generously of-
fered to assist a like movement
ainong her alumni, and also to give

istic happy speech, and the boys
made the old college resound with
their cheers. He remembered his
student days. The old carpet,
chairs,and walls brought to his mind
the time when he stood with tremb-
ling knees before his fellow stu-
dents. Intending to say “literary”
duties he made a little break, but it
was due to his eight years in con-
gress. He said “congressional”
duties,

Mr. Tucker was followed by Mr.
Graves who in a clear, stirring
speech appealed to the young men to
use their opportunities to cultivate
the art of speaking. =~

| Other speeches were made by Mr.
Glenn, Prof. Currell, Prof. More-
land, Prof. Vance, Mr. Leyburn and
Mr. Wm. McC. Martin. The
speeches were short, earnest and to
the point, and were heartily appre-
ciated by the students.

The members of the Graham-Lee
society extend their most hearty
thanks, to all those who have so
kindly aided them. ‘To those

‘The Cotillion.

 

The first German of the year was
given by the University Cotillion
club Thursday, Sept. 16th, from 8
to 12 p. m., in the gymnasium. The
banquet decorations were still in
place and added much to the beauty | '
of the dance. There were more
than; twenty couples participating,
besides quite a ‘number of “stags.”

Mr. Powell was quite as success-
ful as usual in leading many pretty
and effective figures.

On the whole the affair was a
marked success, especially for the
first dance of the season. No one
could find any fault except that it
was too short.

Among the ladies present were
Misses Lucy Shipp, Lulu Semmes,
Bruce Houston, Mary Wilson, Bet-
tie Wilson, Anna Anderson, Annie
Jordan,’ Clifford West, Fannie
White ; besides these from Lexing-
ton there were quite ‘a number of

Wallace Law Maxwell.

‘

We were made sad during. the
summer months by hearing ot the
untimely death of our old comrade,
Wallace Maxwell.
last August, while seining along the
Florida coast near his home at Fer-
nandina, he became entangled in
the meshes of the net and was
drowned.

Maxwell was a native of Mernan-
dina, where he lived until his pri-
mary school career was finished. He
then attended the Fishburne Milita-
ry school at Waynesboro, Va.
where’ he. pursued his academic
course preparatory to Washington
and Lee. At school he was very
popular among the boys, as well as
his teachers, While at the prepara-
tory school he began to shuw him-
self'a leader among his fellows. He
stood well in his @lasses, was loved
by all of the boys, and during‘his

. last year at school he was first lieu-
tenant in Company A, and captain
of the baseball team.

In the fall of 1891 he entered
Washington and Lee, where he con-
tinued his studies for three years.
During his stay here his ability asa
leader continued to show _ itself.
Successful in the class room, at the
front in athletics, always consider-
ate of the wishes of others, a hearty
supporter of every student enter-
prise, itis no wonder that he was a
favorite with every one. In a game

of baseball we were always sure that
Maxwell would play well, if all the
rest of the team got rattled ; and no
one, who saw it, will ever forget
the home run he made over at the

sylvania,and completed the first three
years of his course there, and, but

Final Ball Election.

selected as chairman, called the

pose. Nominations were then in

Lynchburg, Va., placed the name
of Mr, LeRoy C. Barret of Pattons-
ville, Mo., before the meeting. His
nomination was seconded by Mr.
Alban G. Snyder of Charleston, W.
Va., who in a few well chosen words
made a happy climax to Mr. Per-
row’s graceful nomination. Mr,

then rose to place in nomination the

might not be persuaded to cast his
ballot. At 6 o’clock sharp the polls
were closed, and the count made.
One could hear a pin drop as the
votes were counted. When for the
eleventh time the call came “Barret

LE ROY CARR BARRET.

Le Roy Barrett is a native of
Cape Girardeau, Mo., where he was
born March 11, 1877. His early
life was spent in Missouri, until his
father was called to the pastorate of
the First Presbyterian church of
Little Rock, Ark. Here he pursued
his preparatory education until the
fall of 294, when he came to’ Wash-
ington and Lee.

At college Barrett has always
been in the front rank in everything
he has undertaken. In his classes
he has always been in the first file.
Twice the University has awarded
him scholarships. In athletics he
started out as star half-back ‘on the

 

scrub team, and but for his weight,

just

 

or rather lack P it, che would hive
made the’ Varsity team. The same
year he made coxswain on the Harry
Lee crew, a position which he kept a
second year, Last year he was on
the Harry Lee committee, and this
year he is Athletic Editor of the
Collegian, and Local Editor of the
Rina-tuM Pat.

He isa member of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and of,
Theta Nu Epsilon.

Capt. Pratt, M.A., has teen’ amus-
ing himself this vik by'taking the’
physical measurements of all those’
who are willing to keep their. ,en-
gagements with him,
pleasant thing to be in the captain’s
office when measurements are being

The old familiar sight of the long
haired gentry in dusty, padded gar-
ments clad, is once more to be seen
every afternoon on the Athletic
‘ field between the hours of 4 and 6.

_ ‘This may serve as an announce-,
ment to such of our sportless stu-
dents as are ignorant of it.

Up to the present time about  fif-
_ teen faithfuls have gone out regu-
larly and expended their best efforts
in the attempt to put on the grid-
iron a team which can represent our
University in the way she ought to
be represented, which can place her
first in athletics as well as in other
lines.

They are practising diligently
and each day becoming more pro-
ficient in the science of the game,

Come, fellows, let us pull togeth-
er and our success is assured. We
have good material and each day its
strength is developing. It is im-
possible so early in the season to se-

tions,

lect the line up, but a great many of
the ‘applicants deserve ‘individual
mention.

Campbell will oceupy his old po-
sition at full and can be depended
upon to do his duty. He is leading

the interference well, and punting
nicely.

Aufeut, a new student from‘Ken-

‘tucky, will play one of the half-
backs. He comes with a reputation
and his works up to the present
time amply sustains it.

Shields, Dixon and Lang are the
most favored applicants for the oth-
‘er half, and any of the three will
make a goo one,

Powell, Burr and Guthrie are all
striving for the position of quarter.

Powell played the position for our:

 

| bragg team of 96-97, and can be

relied upon. Burr has had some
past experience, and Guthrie has
loads of spirit.

Michler is at left end—that is
enough said,

Oberlin at left tackle will be that
same effectual battering ram.

Muir, a beautiful player, and
with a thorough knowledge of the
game will cause a spasm of home
sickness to seize the left ends of op-
posing teams.

Captain Barclay has been unwell
and not able to take part in the
practice, but has done great work in
directing the practice. We hope
soon to have him in his old position
at right tackle,

Webb and Witherspoon are both
playing a good and reliable game
and will be of use,

McClure and Pancake are devel-

oping into good line men and will}

help us in the centre.

Tucker, Bledsoe T., Bledsoe E.,
Lee, Sloan and others deserve cred-
it fur the works they have done and
are doing. ;

We need more men to come out,
more competition for places, a pow-
erful opposition to the Varsity line
up, and the team will be a credit to
the University.

Mr. Wilson's Installation.

Richmond Dispatch. — Yesterday,
with interesting ceremonies and
in the presence of a notable
gathering, Hon. William L. Wil-
son was installed as president of
Washington and Lee university at
Lexington. ‘nis morning we pub-
lish in full the addreas of the new
president, together with abstracts of
the other speeches delivered on. the
occasion. > We are sure we speak for
every alamaous of the institution,
and for ita thousands of other
friends throughout the country,
when we express the hope that the
ceremonies uf yesterday mark a new
era of usefulness, influence and” de-
velopment for the venerable seat of
learning. At the same time we are
«qually certuin that we also speak
for its alumni and its other friends
when we voice the hope that what-
ever increased usefulness snd in-
fluence, and whatever development
the future may have in store fur the
institution, may be along the lines
of its own traditions—that however
elaborate shall be the enlarged edu-
cational structure that may be erec-
ved at Washington and Lee hercaf-
ler, that structure will rest on the
ancient foundation of the school.
*' * * * * * *

We are glad to see that Mr. Wil-
son antagonized the error so common
ut the North that before the war the
South was in higher education a
laggard and perceptibly behind oth-
er sections ot the country, and we
believe, with him, that it is possible

‘for the South to produce such etates-

men in the future and contribute
them to the country as she produced
and contributed to the country in
the past. We believe it to be in the
power of Washington and Lee to
inake in the future, as she has done
in the past, brilliant contributions
to the list of American statesmen.

' But whan we compure the stutes-

manship. of the present with the
statesmanship of the old regime, we
are warned that our hope for the
future is in holding fast to what is

good in the old 1n our educational |.
