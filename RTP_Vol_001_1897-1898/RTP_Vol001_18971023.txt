NOTES ON THE GAME,
The Alleghany boys put up a
plucky fight, but it would haye
taken a much stronger and better

 

team to stem the tide of defeat which

was being administered by Capt.
Barclay’s men. They played well
-—not well enough,

If Oberlin keeps.up his present
record some of the all Americans
had better look out,

Muir, Alford and Campbell are
always sure of a “good old” gain—
anywhere from ten to twenty yards.
Burr is all right. He is one of
the prettiest quarter-backs we have
ever seen. He plays his part and
gets in many plays seldom expected
from the quarter-back.

Big men fall to the lot of Webb,
and he handles them with utmost
ease and a happy, good humor.

Mr. Bently of Alleghany, says
Oberlin is the best he has ever run
up against. Well, I reckon !

Let the good work go on.

Physical Culture. ~

 

Mr, Pratt, the Physical Director,
delivered a very interesting lecture
in the Y.M.C.A. rooms on the-15th.
His object was to explain the work
ing of his department ‘and the mean’
ing of the anthropometric charts and.
prescriptions , for exercise which he
makes out for those desiring them,

Quite a good crowd greeted Mr.
Pratt. He first explained his
charts, showing the advantages of
the system, and then passed on to
give the magic lantern. pictures of
famous ancient athletes as well as a
few of en and Lee’s atrong
men. ;
-The nana was warmly ap-
plauded especially for his jokes.
In showing the picture of a statue
of Josephine Bonaparte in rather
scanty ‘attire he remarked that some
one asked her if she had. not. had
some hesitancy in going into the
studio dressed thus, to which she
replied “O, no, it was: very nice and
warm there.”

The lecture was’ one of interest
and importance, and there should
have been more} fellows out to hear it.
We would also like to. hear Mr.
Pratt lecture on the “Importance
of Physical Culture.”

 

Hr.—O, I look well in anything
you know,
Sue.— Yes,especially in the dark.

Sigma Chi Supper. ,
~ On» last ‘Saturday evening the
Sigma Chi chapter was entertained
ata supper by Prof. Graves and
his wife, It was a most enjoyable
affair, and one that will be Jong ‘re-
membered by’ the participants. The
parlor and dining room were tastil y
decorated with the fraternity colors,
a feature which added much to the
beauty of the affiir, Beside the
menilers of the chapter, there were
present Misses Carmichael and Mil-
dred Myers, who helped Miss Mary
Turner Graves to entertain,

After the supper the whole party
went on a tally-ho ride, which was
under the care of Miss Annie Joe

‘It isa very pitiful sight to see
would-be men act the part of “baby”
in the drama of life. The action of
Captain Barclay on Thursday was
childish in the extreme. It is the
opinion of everyone that the Captain
is a baby, and until his actions
prove otherwise everyone’s opinion
will remain unchanged, Let the
Captain play low and hard, and if
his man doesn’t get through him,
no one will accuse him of it, If
his present way of doing continues,
however, a notice will have to be
posted on the ground: “Don’t dis-

 

turb the baby——he is fretful today.
