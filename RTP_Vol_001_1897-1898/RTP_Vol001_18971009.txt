Welcome to the Two New Law
Professors,

 

In welcoming Hon. H. St.George
Tucker and Dr. W. R. Vance, the
editors of THe Rina-rum PHI are
greeting ‘old . familiar faces.”
Though Mr, Tucker has not ' long
been identified with the law. school
of Washington and’ Lee,his speeches
upon the hustings, his smiling face
and gracious urbanity had won the
hearts.of many a W. 1. U, boy be-
fore he came to make Lexington his
home for a second time. When we

laid to rest his beloved father, whose
memory hovers like a benediction
over the law school, many of us felt
that the son would worthily succeed
the. father.

It was no surprise,

 

 

cup BL

 

therefore, when the Board of ‘Trus-
tees in June elected him to the chair
of Constitutional Law.’ He has won
his way already into the hearts of
“the boys.’ Would that the law
which he teaches with so much en-
thusiasm could steal as — into
our heads !

Mr. H. St. G. Tucker was born
April 5, 1853, In the fall of 1871
he entered Washington and Lee
University. His father then resid-
ed at one of Lexington’s historic old

homes, Blandome, still occupied by
‘members of the Tucker family.

Tu
1875 Mr. Tucker received the de-
gree of A. M., then the highest aca-
demic degree conferred by this insti-

“} tution,

In 1876 he won the degree B, L.

-|'The Graham-Lee in those bygone

days of hotly contested society hon-
ors awarded him tlie debater’s med-
al, But the crowning honor of his
college days was not medals nor de-
grees, but the glory of being one of
the oarsmen in\the first commence-

‘ment race ever rowed on North riv-

er between the Albert Sidneys and
the Hurry Lees. Mr. Tucker was
on the Harry Lee'crew. ‘The race
was declared off. There was a foul !
It was somebody’s fault, but if ask-
ed “whose” the discreet editor must
answer in the words of Viola:

O Time, thou must untangle this, not I ;
It is too hard « knot for me to untie |

Shortly after graduation, Mr.
Tucker: married Miss Henrietta
Johnston, daughter of Col, William
Preston Johnston, now president of

|'Tulane University.

After having practiced law in
Staunton for several years, he was
elected in 1889 Democratic repre-
sentative from the Tenth Virginia
district and remained in congress
till March, 1897. In congress he
forged steadily to the front and when
he left he was a recognized leader
on the Democratic side. ‘To him the
South owes a lasting debt of grati-
tude as he was the author of the bill
for the repeal of the Federal election
law. ‘These laws were repealed
the 53rd Congress, and the South
was thus relieved forever, we trust,
of galling Federal espionage at the

 

polls, Another noteworthy bill of

year.

which Mr, Tucker was the author, is
the bill for the election of senators
by the direct .vote of the people.
This bill has already passed the
House.

In the chair of Law at Wash-
ington and Lee our best wish for
Mr. Tucker is that “he will ‘follow
n the footsteps of his illustrious
predecessor.”

Mr. William Reynolds Vance
was clected Assistant Professor of
Law in June and promoted to the
dignity of Adjunct Professor in
September. Mr, Vance entered W.
I. U. in 1890, was instructor in
English ’91-93, and in German and
English 793-95. He won the Young
Scholarship in ’92,'the Mapleson in

’93, and was Howard Houston Fel-|,, .

low in 794-5, He took A, M. and
Ph. D., and in 1897 B. L. His ca-
reer at college was a brilliant one
from start to-finish. His friends
expect much of him and believe they |’
have a substantial basis upon which |’
to build their vir expectations. Seaedhldnee
A Novel Concert.

The Graham ranch had an unus-
ual kind of entertainment the other
night... They called up the Paxton
ranch over the telephone and re-
quested a concert from the phono-
graph with which these country |B
boys pass away their time. The
Buena Vista friends kindly granted
the request, and music, performed
in New York city, was served up
again over a telephone 5CO° miles
from the. place where it was first
heard. “Mr. Cuptain Stop  the|-
Ship,” “Estudiantina” and other
familiar airs were reproduced exact-
ly, and the sound was so clear that
two persons, by placing the recei ver
close ‘to their ears could hear the
inusic at one time.

Lexington is jubilant over W. &
Js first football victory, and a glo-
rious one it was too, unexpected to

 

some people as .the following clip-
ping from the Washington Times
shows, :
“The Columbian team proposes
_ to make a hard fight for the cham-
pionship of the Suuth, and as their
strongest rival for the houor is tlie
» eleven of the University of Virginia
‘they will be able to get a line on the
merits of the stars of the Old Do-
minion by.their games with the
‘ smaller colleges of the state.”
The University"has every reason
to feel proud of her team. Handi-
' capped by a very light line, by sev-
eral inexperienced players, by being
-, in training for a, very short time,
they won a signal victory over, a
much heavier team composed uf ex-
yi ‘perienced players. Let the good
‘c) works go on; we have other op-
"ponents to meet and vanquish, Per-
'2 haps before'the season is over old

The address by Mr. McClure last
Sunday was thoughtful and instrue-
tive. His subject was “Missions,”
and he brought out ina clear and

 

attractive manner the importance of
widening our Christian horizon and

seeing in the heathen what we our- |’

selves might be but for the elevat-
ing influence of the gospel light.
After his address the president
announced that it had been arrang-
ed to have a regular class for the

; systematic study of inissions, In

response to the invitation, seme four

or five have already joined.” It, is|’
believed that even for those who |

have no special interest in this sub-
ject, the study will prove both inter-
esting and instructive. ~~,"

The membership this year is con-
siderably lyrger thap for several
years and the mien are realizing the
importance and pleasure of this
phase of college life. Wehope, how-
ever, that many more will give the
work their hearty support and will
attend regularly.

‘Tomorrow Mr. Paxton, of Lets
ington, will address the association,

and we want him to meet a large:

attendance.

The Rooter's Club.

On Monday mornig a notice was
posted requesting all those ‘who
could sing to meet in the Glee rooms
that afternoon in order to organize
a Rooter’s Club, Quite a number
of men turned out, and the pleasing
airs “Eli Banana,” “Hot Times” and
“There is a Tavern in Town’? “
made all the more pleasant beeause
the words sung to them were praises
to our Alma Mater, and to her stur-
dy men. The fellows sang with a
will; and, though the tones might
not have had all the musical merit
which would have been expected
from a chorus of trained singers, yet
they did very well.
ing was ‘kept up during the week,
so that those who would not be al-
lowed the honor of contesting on
the field, might yet have a small
part in the glory by doing their
duty on the side lines, Some very
good words have been written to the
metre of catchy airs. . The words of
the tune of “Eli Banana” are espe-
cially good. They have a gvod,
hearty ring and can be sung loudly,
yet with slight: strain on the voice.
With this ‘edition we have inserted
some of the words in order that the
students may become familiar with

them for the sake of future occa-
sions.

Manager Lisle has sent on to
Spalding in order to get a nose
guard made which wil! successfully
protect the colossal proboscis which
accompanies Mr, Fitzhugh’s coun-
tenance. Weare in hopes that the
order will not result in the making

ofa corner in rubber.

A Retrospect of the Columbian |
Games. ~

 

The season of ’97 opened very

' auspiciously for Washington & Lee,
‘Tn our first game we defeated the

- strong team of Columbian Univer-
' sity by a score of 12 to 2 . Although
victory is now» with W. & LL. yet
her work, is.by,.no.means accom- |
plished.

ct By way of’ criticism, it was no-
- ticeable in Friday’s game that, team
work was markedly-absent, - as only
the backs interfered. For this the’!

_ excuse may ‘be offered that our light !
~ line was opposed by an especially
. strong one j:but, boys, get to Work,
No complaint. can be made. of our
~ treatment “from ‘the, hands: of the
«faculty, for that: has been unusually
; ‘generous. ...When anyone is;.to be
- blamed new, ‘it.must be the appli-
«| cayts for? the »:team. ;| Let; Work
henceforth ;;be the watchword, ‘and

. with this in view. be prompt, un the
field for practice, |.
“pig Weal have ; colleg spirit, or
, should. have ; and inasmuch.as it is
our duty to uphold Washington and

. Lee’s, Ipfty,; standard in .everything

Of much. benefit was Columbian’ 8
ore to us; for, in the first place; it
‘}/ pointed out our defects, namely ; lack
of team, work, slowness betyveen plays
as well as in their executign, also, it
may be added that the plays did not

_ have enough force, ‘ caused partly by

_ disorganized efforts, ‘and in part by
not running hard enough. Quick-

‘ness and strength must be culti-
vated wes t

Good head work was shown in
playing a punting game, which wus
"beautifully, carried out.

“In the next place Columbian gave
usa line on the’ V, M. I. In all
‘fairness it must be acknowledged

-that O, U. was weakened ‘consider-
ably by Friday’s game, so in ‘@ com-
periten ae the: ¥. M. I. and W, &

Na

L., ibaa from the score, the ad-
vantage is with us, Again, one de-
cision’ materially affected Colum-
bian’s chances,—but pass that by.
V. M. I’s interference was the bet-
ter, but-they were lamentably weak
on the ends, *W. & L. U. is strong
on the ends, and, all in all, without
the defensive.

would have been had the line read :

would, have sounded better, been
easier on the voice, and would.have
saved the writer and ‘editor from

The Cotillion club gave a very
delightful hop on the 8th, The
floor was just right, and so was the
weather, and so it-was thoroughly
enjoyed by every one present. The

‘lmen on the Columbian team were

there, and there being so many men

umbian, after much difficulty — per-
suided his’ men to

The address by Mr, Paxton last |’

Sunday was on “Success,” He il-
lustrated his talk by drawing freely
from the Bible, which he declared
was the best guide to success in any

field of labor,

We are always glad to have our
friends from town come in with us
and we look furward with pleasure
to an address in the near future by
another of our Lexington supportere,

‘Tomorrow Mr, Pratt will conduct
the services, and his subject will be
“The” Christian ° Athlete.’ Let
“évery student, particularly the ath-
letic men hear this talk, which will,
we doubt not, be well worth his
coming.

enenel Exercises.

 

The e chapel exercises which many
of us have enjoyed daily seem now
‘about to assume a different aspect,

Hitherto the attendance has been

i

 

purely voluntary, but the exercises
have been so attractive and helpful
_ that some did’ not feel that they
“could afford to absent themselves.
It is rumored that the attendance
will be greatly increased within two
weeks—so much increased that

‘every student will attend at least

once a week. Does it not seem u
little strange to suggest compulsory
chapel attendance? And yet it is
highly important that there be some
gathering of the students, As it
now is, no notice can be given to the
students, for they can never be got-
ten together.. We trust many of
the boys can find time to avail them-
selves of a real privilege. which ov-

 

curs at 8:40 o’elock on every morn-
ing. No one is compelled to come
to these but all are cordially wel-

come,

It is earnestly hoped by all who
are interested in the game, that
nothing that has happened during
the last few days will have the ef-
fect of cancelling ovr football dates
with the Institute, Our games with
them are the most interesting of the
season, and it will “surely be a pity
ifwe must do away with them this
full, ‘The managemeht of the team
sells season tickets with the under-
standing that six games will be
played in Lexington, All foreign
teams are brought here at a greit
expense, and it is only by evening
up matters by clearing something
from the Institute games that we

are enabled to keep the team out of |:

debt ; sv, if we mus¢ not have our
games with the V. M. L, half of
our games will be gone, and the
most interesting ones at that. Last
year half of the interest in’ baseball
was taken from us by the. cadets

nut being alloweJ to play ua, and.

shall this be the cass this year with
football ?

We all remember the inimitable
little story of Page's, “How, Jenny

Feased her mind.” Now: it seems that

some fulks, like Jenny, have minds
that must be rid of a certain amount
at given intervals, We are sorry
the riddance took the form it did
this time, but now that these minds
are easy, let us have a little game
or two and see what our fellows can
do when the ratio is eleven to eleven.

“© "A New Scheme.

 

' Last Suturlay evening, upon
motion of one of the members
of the “Wash.” the  Graham-
Lee svciety was invited. tu meet
with the W ushington suciety in Juint
session. ‘The ubject of the: meeting
was to discuss the advisability, of
having joint debates every six weeks.
There was little discussion necessary,
Hardly had the subject been men-
tioned before the members of the
two societies were agreed “toa man”
that the idea was a capital one, A
motion to the effect that we should
have such joint debates. was passed
without a dissenting voice, showing
the good feeling. between the mem-
hers of these two most important or-
ganizations, It was decided that &
committee of three should be ap-
pointed to draw up rules governing
the} debates. Mr. Hammat, Mr.’
Anderson and Mr, McClung. were
appointed on this committee, and
will report Saturday night. ,
rules us proposed by them and ac-
cepted by the societies will be pub-
lished next week.’ The first debate
will come off Saturday evening,
Nov. 20th. We expect to have
three members of the faculty to act
as judges. Withal it is a most hap-
py scheme and we expect great en-
thusiasm in literary circles.

A Naughty ‘One's Frolic.’ +

 

* At Princeton a few weeks” ‘ago
some bold, reckless Naughty-one
made bright history for his class by
once more robbing the famous bell
of “Old North” of its clapper. The
deed is all the more glorious, in that
the faculty of late. years have made
it next to an impossibility. (i

Only a few. of the class of.1901
met on Friday at midnight. in the
shadow of “Old North,” where, af-
ter a whispered consultation, one.of.
their number began to climb a wire
rope hand-over-hand to the roof‘ of
the chapel. ‘The rope is used in un-
choring the derrick by. which the
stones of the new library. building

|are swung into place, and . passes

from the trunk of an:elm.over.the
roof of “Old North” to: the derrick.

Up this rope « Naughty-one’s
hgro climbed, reaching the roof ex-
hausted but shappy.”: From. thence
he was to climb the belfry tower -by

a Jightning-rod, but this idea had to

be given up,-as he:would be in sight
of the ‘vigilant «head, “proctor. *In-
forming. ‘those below: ‘of'the trouble
& rope was ‘passed’ up’ ‘and “by. it,
thrown around 4 pillar ‘ofthe’ bel-
fry, he reached’ the coveted prize—
the twenty-five pound. bell «clappei
— which ‘he silently i“ downto. ithe
watchers below.” A QOH AES
To the surprise of all; the’ "mio
cent heroes included, no ‘bell: rang
out for chapel au ‘the ‘fullowing
morning and great was" the pride: ‘of
him, ‘who with’ blistered : ‘hands'i in
his pockets, walked’ among‘ his‘fel-
lows asking who: did it 2: The’ bell
of “Old North” ‘has rung” for’ over
a hundred years, but’ has had dozena
of clappers. « The atore’ laid cin’ “by
the favulty some: fifteen years ago is
now’ probably : exhausted, ‘andthe
chances are that’ this: ‘year. ‘thet! bell

So, bold friend, don’t: try it, as
the look of _astonishment'* on; old
Patsy’s face would be horribly:aw-
ful when he, to his surprise, would
find that he was. late—to: chapel.
Besides, some one would quite like-
