And our men they i happy as could be ;
For we knew that d 7

We would teach ’em how to play,
And soon we’d have ’em up a tree.

At the game, at the game,

Where we put their team to shame ;
And their line like bane rolled away ;
’T was there on the field

Tha to us they had to yield,

And now we are happy all the day.

On the field, on the field,

Where to us they had to ‘yield ;

And our men went running round the end ;
: "Twas there we met,

And we wiped them up you bet,

Aud now we have money we can lend.

Oh, the beer, oh, the beer,

Yes, it made us feel so queer,
When we got home from the tight ;
For we’d met our fate,

And hid to celebrate,

Tf it took up the most of the night.

That night the formerly jolly

ticing, ere the student shall discover

The first sentence of this article
says it is always the way of the

converse statement, that the bright-

Law Class Organization.

At half past one o’clock last Sat-
urday afternoon the law class stu-
dents of the class of ’98, met for the
purpose of organization. Prof. C.
A. Graves was chairman of the
meeting, he having: been selected by
the two sides. There were three
officers to be elected—n president,
vice-president, and secretary and
treasurer. /

For the office of president there
were two names nominated. Mr,
Wilson of Kentucky, ina short
speech, nominated Mr. Van Astor
Batchelor of North Carolina. ‘The

C. W. F. Spencer of South Caro-

in nomination the name of Mr.

West Virginia. Mr. D, M. Ham-

Faulkner’s nomination, The nomi-
nations were then closed and a secret
ballot was taken. Mr. Batchelor’s
election was the result. Upon mio-

A good many of the students and
a few of the professors are missing
much by not attending ‘the regular

the morning. Coming’ as they do
just before the busy part of the daily
routine they strengthen and reassure

Prize Story.

 

The Southern Collegian editors
have taken up their work with great
zeal and have made an unprecedent-
ed move. At their last. meeting
they decided to give a prize, not less
than five dollars or its equivalent,
to the writer of the best short story
published in the Collegian. ‘This is
not given out of the funds of the
Collegian ; but by the editors per-
sonally. ‘They want to encourage
literary work among the students
generally, the idea being to correct
the impression that the editors w ant
to monopolize the space of the Colle-
gian for their own articles. ‘They

Collegian Editors.

 

E. C. Smith of Montana, and W.
Kyle McClung of Virginia, were
elected by the Washington Literary
Society on last Saturday night as
their two associate editors of the
Southern Collegian, Great harmony
prevailed and the gentlemen elected
were the only ones nominated. It
was understood that they were agree-
ble associates to the editor-in-chief,
Mr. M.G. Perrow. This completes
the staff of our most worthy mere

The erroneous opinion is enter-
tained by some that Tue Rine-rum

Such is surely not the case as is evi-
denced by the fact that Mr. Barret

are thoroughly in sympathy with
each other and with different inter-
ests they will both be successful.

Washington and Lee Versus
Columbian University.

On Friday next Washington and
Lee’s fuot-ball season will open with
a game against the Columbian Uni-
versity of! Washington. Now Wash-
ington and Lee is going to win that
game, so all must go out aud cheer
the boys to victory. Every student
must be there, if the team is to re-
ceive the support that it should
have. Come out, bring your calic,
or if you haven’t one bring some-
body else’s, yell, sing the song which
the fout-ball muse has composed for
us, and you will not only, encourage
the players but make the game more
enjoyable to yourself.

», The Foot-ball Meeting.

Nearly all the. students followed
the advice on the ‘magnificent poster
seen on the bulletin board Friday,
the 24th, and came to the Newcomb
Hall at 4 o’clock to hear President '
Wilson’s address on foot-ball. |

He said he knew nothing about
foot-ball and was not prepared to:
give us a practical speech. Never-:
theless he advocated the playing of’
the game and expressed ' his earnest
desire that the team be a succeasful _
one. He emphasized the importance’
of regular practice , in Attginiog, the
best results,

Only one thing met the disap--
proval of the boys, that was his
promise to keep up the policy of
the faculty in regard to the team . '
going on trips. One reason the.
managers of our teams have so much
trouble with’ finances is: that: our’
teams are obliged to stay at home
and pay guarantees to visitors when
the gate receipts do 1 nat pay more
than incidental expenses.” The only’
way a manager can make money is
by a trip, and this opportunity the *
faculty denies him.

The’ faculty says if we ‘have ‘a’!
goed team they will let us go. One’
might as well keep a little bird in
its nest. Mitdiinbist that* it must hot
try to “fly until it knows how. A”
team gets more experience and bet-
ter practice by going ona trip than
in any other way: above all they *
gain confidence in themselves. When *

they'get confidence they can Bae
