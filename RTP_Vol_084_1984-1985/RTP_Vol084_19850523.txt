Lacrosse tale facing new chapter?

Once again, Division | options being weighed

EDITORS’ NOTE: When Washington and Lee's
1985 lacrosse season ended with the Generals’ 9-6
loss to the University of Maryland-Baltimore
County, the question of whether W&L should dis-
continue playing Division I lacrosse made its an-
nual appearance. Ring-tum Phi Sports Editor
Mike Stachura spent more than a month interview-
ing players, coaches, administrators, alumni and
observers in preparing this report assessing the
future of lacrosse at Washington and Lee.

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

 

The tale is a curious one:

There once was a little boy. The little boy had
a bicycle that was his pride and joy. He would
ride his bike all day long simply because that
was what he liked to do. His friends, who all
had bikes like his, would ride with him, and
some days they would have races. In these
races, the little boy would always finish near
the leaders. His friends came to expect the lit-
tle boy to be among the leaders.

Then one day when the little boy went out to
go riding with his friends he noticed something
different about some of their bikes. They had
different gears and could go a lot faster than
his old bike. Soon, he was not among the lead-
ers in the races anymore. In the races, he
would start out close to the leaders but would
always end up finishing somewhere in the mid-
dle of the pack.

He knew that on the next street over, none of
the kids had these bikes with the gears. They
all had bikes like his. Still, he would try to race
against the bikes with the gears, hoping his old
bike someday would be able to be with the lead-
ers again.

Things didn’t get any better, though, so he’

decided he had better think of something to do
to make riding his bike fun again, because it
certainly wasn’t much fun anymore.

If this seems a bit remote from the world of
lacrosse sticks and Generals, try this cast of
characters: the little boy is Washington and
Lee University, his bike is W&L’s lacrosse
team, the gears are athletic scholarships and
the next street over is Division III. The little
boy has a tough decision on his hands.

So does Washington and Lee and its lacrosse
program.

W&L, for much of the 1970s the force in
lacrosse below the Maryland state line, suffer-
ed its third straight losing season this year. It’s
the first such slump since the school decided in
1971 to play in NCAA Division I, yet operate un-
der the financial guidelines (no scholarships)
of Division III.

This unique combination in a day when
money and top-level collegiate sports pro-
grams seem necessarily to go hand in hand has
given W&L the unique opportunity to reconsi-
der its divisional status in lacrosse. With any
such reconsideration, though, the sides and the
questions are many. As the lacrosse program
was at a crossroads in the spring of 1971, so

may it be again in 1985.

The future of the W&L lacrosse program re-
cently has been a frequent topic of discussion
among players, coaches, administrators, fans
and alumni. In a recent vote, this year’s
lacrosse team is reported to have evenly split
among those who want to stay Division I and
those who want to drop to Division III.

The one thing almost all accept as a given is
that the game of Division I lacrosse has chang-
ed dramatically since the University made the
decision 14 years ago to compete in Division I.
The reason: the growing effect of the athletic
scholarship. All agree that the University
needs soon to make some kind of response.

Athletic Director William D. McHenry sum-
marized the choices for W&L. ‘‘We have three
options,” he said. ‘“‘We can stay as we are and
try to continue to compete with the best in Divi-
sion I, we can stay in Division I and soften our
schedule, or we can try to be nationally
competitive in Division III.”’

The options are few. The views of those op-
tions and their attendant problems, though, are
many.

Can W&L continue as it is, competing with
the best Division I has to offer? Most say,
“No.”

Head coach Dennis A. Daly, in his second
year at the Generals’ helm, has yet to see a
winning season. He has spent many a night and
day thinking about the problems his team has
had to face in those two years and has the look
of frustration that accompanies such thinking.

 

Lacrosse coach Dennis A. Daly watches his
Generals against the University of Maryland.

He is to-the-point in his response to The Ques-
tion:

“To answer the question, ‘Can we be compe-
titive in Division I with the way we're doing

things?,’ I would have to say, ‘No.’ I would
have to say that the way we're doing things
right now at Washington and Lee, I don’t see
any chance of us winning a [Division I] na-
tional championship. I don’t foresee us to have
a chance each year on a consistent basis to
make the tournament, and in years that we

Four face charges
of credit card fraud

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Four Washington and Lee students
were arrested Saturday afternoon on
charges of fraudulent use of a tel-
ephone credit card and a Visa card
belonging to another student, police
said.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said the charges involved the use of
an AT&T Calling Card reported lost
by sophomore David A. Shugart ‘“‘to
run up a rather large phone bill.”
Sutton said the Visa card was used by
only one of the students.

Sutton said the arrests were made
at 10 Lee Ave., the address of all four
of the students.

eSophomore Felton E. May II, 20,
of Hummelstown, Pa., was charged
with two counts of credit card fraud
and one felony count of credit card
theft. Sutton said the charges involv-
ed both the telephone credit card and
the Visa card.

eJunior Bryan K. Johnson, 21, of
Jersey City, N.J., and sophomores
Calvin D. Rankin, 20, of Los Angeles
and Walter J. Hopkins Jr., 19, of
Kingwood, Texas, each were charged
with credit card fraud and with ac-
cessory after the fact to credit card
theft. The charges involved the use of

the telephone credit card, Sutton
said.

“It’s possible that other charges
might be brought,”’ Sutton said, but
he said he “won’t know for a while
yet”’ whether that will occur.

Sutton said more than $300 in il-
legal charges were made to the Call-
ing Card during one month, and he
said billing information for the last
two to three weeks is not yet avail-
able. ‘There could be more,” he
said.

Suttton said most of the illegal calls
were made in Lexington, but that
some were made in another state.

Sutton declined to say what infor-
mation led to the arrests. ‘‘That
would be giving away trade secrets,
and might prevent similar arrests in
the future,”’ he said.

Shugart last week reported to
police that illegal calls had been
made on his card from Feb. 10 to
April 30. He said he had lost the
wallet on Feb. 10 between Evans Din-
ing Hall and the University Library.

Shugart said he cooperated with
the police investigation but declined
to comment on whether the Execu-
tive Committee has been contacted
concerning the case.

In explaining the difference in the
charges against the four students,

Counselor at Texas A&M named associate dean

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

A student counselor at Texas A&M
University has been appointed to the
newly created associate dean of stu-
dents position at Washington and
Lee.

Anne C.P. Schroer was selected
from about 155 candidates for the
position and will begin her duties
Aug. 1.

Schroer will assume varied respon-
sibilities, including working with the
women’s programs and the transi-
tion to coeducation, according to
Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

In addition, Schroer will help As-
sociate Dean of Students Michael A.
Cappeto and Placement Consultant
Stephen P. Bredin with career coun-
seling, ‘‘a need we have identified as
requiring additional attention and
staff,’’ John said.

“She will have generalist responsi-
bilities,’’ John added. ‘‘Because she
will be the only women on the [dean
of students’} staff, it would be nat-
ural that she will be dealing with the
transition and coeducation.”’

John said that Schroer’s personal
characteristics, in addition to her ex-
perience, led to her selection.

“Her experience and background,
as well as her educational back-
ground, certainly made her an at-
tractive candidate,’’ John explained.

Retreats

“She has a background in counseling
and career planning as well as in the
general area of working closely with
students.”

Schroer, 40, said she is excited
about the new position.

“T think it’s going to be a challeng-
ing appointment, but also interesting
and fun,” she said. ‘‘I’m really look-
ing forward to working with the new
women as they come onto campus
and also with the men.”

Schroer said she first heard about
the position through an advertise-
ment in The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation.

“When I read that ad, I thought,
‘My goodness, that job describes
everything I'd like to do,’ ’’ she said.
“It was almost on a lark that I ap-
plied for it because I wasn’t sure
what my competition would be.”’

Schroer was one of six applicants
invited to campus in March for inter-
views, John said.

“IT fell in love with the place,”
Schroer said of her two-day visit. “‘I
just thought it was gorgeous.’

Schroer met with two different
groups of students and said she was
impressed with the quality of the stu-
dents.

“They both were pretty open with
me, and I could see where some of
the attitudes are different and are
probably going to feel challenged
when women come onto campus,”’
she added.

After meeting with some faculty
and staff members, Schroer said, ‘‘I
just felt like a lot of the homework
[for the transition to coeducation]
had been very well carried out.’’

Schroer said she took several
weeks before accepting the job offer
because she and her family needed to
decide whether it was worth moving
from College Station, Texas. Her hus-
band also is a psychologist at Texas
A&M, and they have two sons, ages
13 and 15.

“We are a dual-career couple try-
ing to think about how both of us can
have an active career and still do the
parenting we want to do,’’ Schroer
said. All of the family’s previous
moves have been because of her hus-
band’s work, she added, and ‘“‘the
family is feeling especially challeng-
ed, also.”’

Her husband will begin looking for
a job in the Lexington area.

“Getting established in a new com-
munity is going to take some jug-
gling,’’ Schroer said, but she believes
this will help the women students at
W&L “‘see how a professional woman
tries to blend her duties with her per-
sonal family responsibilities.”’

Schroer said she will be able to help
both male and female students pre
pare for being in similar dual-career
situations, in which both the husband
and wife work. ‘‘As we look at the
kind of student body at W&L, we see
very, very able people who are more

and more career-minded,”’ she add-
ed. ‘‘We need to pay attention to that
with workshops and seminars.”’

Helping with the coeducational
programs and perhaps forming some
women’s support groups are other
activities that Schroer would like to
do, in addition to the career develop-
ment and counseling.

“What I'll be listening for is for
what the students have a need,” she
said, adding that she’ll do ‘tas much
personal development and career
counseling as I can schedule.”’

During her conversations with
W&L students, Schroer said, she
gained the impression that many are
concerned about the fraternity sys-
tem in light of the decreased number
of men that will be at W&L.

‘‘T understand that in terms of dol-
lars and cents,”’ said Schroer, adding
that good communication with the In-
terfraternity Council will be essential
next year.

Schroer said another possible pro-
blem with coeducation could be that
the men will have to deal with in-
creased academic competition from
the women. ‘‘Hopefully, that will be
challenging and exciting and not feel-
ing like [the women] are taking
over.’

Schroer received her education at
the University of Strasbourg in
France, Defiance College in De-
fiance, Ohio, Washington State Uni-
versity and the University of Nor

OPINION ayes se
Keep Div. |

It’s springtime, and that means birds, flowers, gradua-
tions, warm weather, Goshen ... and lacrosse — not necessa-
rily in that order.

As happens every springtime, though, the last item on that
list appears to be in danger here at Washington and Lee.
Once again, the powers-that-be have studied the lacrosse sit-
uation, namely whether the W&L laxmen should continue to
play in the ultra-competitive Division I without awarding
scholarhips. For now, a compromise decision appears to
have been reached — the Generals will stay in Division I for
at least the next season but will play a ‘‘watered down’’
schedule.

That decision is only a temporary solution — a Bandaid. It
solves nothing in the long run.

Unfortunately, the lacrosse problem has no remedy analo-
gous to the move to coeducation, which not only healed the
problems but actually appears to have made the patient bet-
ter than before.

The arguments for and against continuing to play Division
I lacrosse are well-known. To us, there appear to be four pos-
sible ‘‘solutions”’ : continue to play Division I, play a watered-
down Division I schedule, drop to Division III, or resume
awarding athletic scholarships for lacrosse and remain Divi-
sion I.

The last option is the least palatable. Awarding athletic
scholarships, a practice discontinued at W&L in the 1950s
after a cheating scandal, would be a more fundamental
change than coeducation. Our University — like all univer-
sities — exists for academics, which athletic scholarships do
little if anything to improve.

Dropping to Division III is a frequently suggested remedy
for the problems plaguing W&L lacrosse. “Drop to Division
III and we’ll be national champions every year”’ is the com-
mon argument. What proponents of that course forget is that
W&L continues to attract outstanding lacrosse players each
year because of the competition — the U.Va.s, the Mary-
lands, the North Carolinas — we can guarantee them. W&L’s
lacrosse greats didn’t come here to play Hampden-Sydney,
Hobart or Roanoke. Those would be just some of the teams
we would play in Division III, the top lacrosse players would
go elsewhere and within a few years W&L might be just in the
middle of the Division III pack.

The same arguments extend to the current plan, remaining
Division I but playing a watered-down schedule. Rather than
playing the top teams mentioned above, W&L will play a cou-
ple of top Division III schools and Division I schools such as
Bucknell and Dartmouth — hardly ‘“‘name’’ lacrosse teams.
A watered-down schedule will not allow even the best W&L
team to compete seriously for the national championship —to
be the best you naturally have to play the best. W&L’s name
will quickly disappear from the ranks of the top Division I
lacrosse schools, the quality of the players will decline and
the net result will be the same as if we were to drop to Divi-
sion III. (In fact, some might argue that this step is merely a
transition to dropping to Division III. )

No, the first alternative seems to be the best. It is not a
perfect solution, but if W&L makes a recommitment to Divi-
sion I lacrosse without scholarships, it can continue to be
competitive with the top teams. The top players — probably
skeptical during the past few years about W&L’s commit-
ment to Division I lacrosse — will be reassured. Recognizing
W&L’s outstanding reputation for academics, the true stu-
dent-athletes — the kind of well-rounded individuals that any
university should seek to attract — will come to Lexington in
search of more than a lacrosse field.

It’s unfortunate, but true: W&L may never win a Division I
national collegiate lacrosse championship. That, though, is
not the purpose of the lacrosse team — or, indeed, the sports
program — at W&L. Remaining in Division I will allow play-
ers to compete against the best in the country, and W&L fans,
such as they are, will have the chance to return to Wilson
Field to watch the best lacrosse teams in the nation.

The Generals may not always win, but they do — and will
— have a chance. We ought not take that opportunity from

them. —By Bruce Potter and Mike Allen

Shattered

Every Monday morning, I look forward to taking prospec-
tive students and their parents on a tour of the campus. I like
to share the history of the ‘‘hallowed”’ halls with them, share
how the Doremus gymnasium came about, how Lee himself
first planned for a school of journalism, and explain the ad-
vantages students gain from the Honor System.

But last Monday was different. I had explained to a pro-
spective transfer student and his father how the Honor Sys-
tem helps to develop the ‘‘gentleman’’ virtures the system
espouses. They wanted to see a dormitory. As I opened the
door to Graham-Lees, my eyes caught sight of three smashed
bottles immediately in front of me and the two visitors.
Someone had enjoyed dropping bottles from the fourth floor
through the stairwell.

Nice move, guys.

How was I to answer the father’s statement that he thought
the Honor System, the idea of the gentleman and the concept
of respect, helped to stop such childish behavior? Somehow,
the son’s attempt at response — ‘‘But this is college, Dad”
—seemed woefully inadequate.

Rom put W&L’s best face forward as
Director of Publications.

He worked behind the scenes, as
much by necessity as choice for there

too soon. Rom took the time to do
things right, so there was never
enough time, because he was an
incurable perfectionist. No matter.

casionealled for — nothing more, but
never anything less, either — from
clean and simple to filigreed and
rococo. ;

Thoughts

MY
VIEW

By Jon
Zagrodzky

 

 

When the bell rang for the first
class back in September 1981, I
remember being rather apprehen-
sive about W&L, and I wondered at
that time whether my initial uneasi-
ness would stay with me until grad-
uation. Well, it didn’t, and despite a
somewhat trying freshman year, I
have come to enjoy the University
and its surroundings. So, for my last
column, I should like to salute some
of the people who have made the ex-
perience here truly fascinating.

No organization at W&L provided
me with more entertainment than the
folks at Buildings and Grounds. As
anyone who lives in Woods Creek
Apartments will attest, B&G is a
strange organization. I can’t count
the times I’ve seen some guy with a
small pail in front of the apartments
collecting tiny bits of trash while
mountains of garbage in back of the
apartments go unnoticed for months.
We're just lucky that no one ever
walks on the trail behind the apart-
ments, or it could be really embar-
rassing. This pales in comparison,
however, with the lovely and func-
tional footbridge located behind the
library. Designed in cooperation with
the Waddell Elementary School
Corps of Engineers, this wonder is

Alleviating racism means communication

To the Editors:

The racial situation on campus has
received a good deal of attention late-
ly. The black students have request-
ed that a representative be appointed
to the Student Control Committee or
the Executive Committee to advise
on cases concerning minority stu-
dents. Many students are against
such a representative and, further-
more, see an organization designed
to cultivate black unity as separatist
and as something which discourages
a mix between the races. At any rate
there is a racial problem on campus.

When I say “racial problem,”’ I do
not mean that white students dislike
black students simply because they
are black, but many of the white stu-

dents have simply not been exposed
to blacks in their most formative
years. Due to this, confrontations be-
tween black and whites are often
awkward, and this prevents commu-
nication from being made. It seems
to be for this reason that the minority
students experience discrimination. I
stress that this discrimination may
not be intended, but it is created.
There is no reason for discrimina-
tion to exist. As students at an institu-
tion of higher learning, and as human
beings, I feel that there is a moral re-
sponsibility on the part of each one of
us to alleviate racial friction. This
can be done to a certain extent by
coming to grips with the fact that life
is being made difficult for quite a few

pes ouns, due to no fault of their own.
If one can accept the possibility that
he may feel uneasy around a person
of a different race, he may become
able to prevent such awkwardness in
the future. Perhaps good ways to
begin to alleviate this problem,
which may not be aS great as one
may think, is to simply say ‘‘Hello”’
or study together. Communication’
however, must be opened.

There is no reason for discrimina-
tion, there are only reasons why it ex-
ists. It is well within our abilities to
diminish the unjust and unfortunate
problem we have.

out virtually overnight. He didn’t
work that way by choice, but his
years as a newspaper reporter and
columnist prepared him well for a
rigorous production schedule.

Being human as he was, Rom was
certainly easier to work with at some
times than at others, but no matter
how thick and fast things were flying,
I never got the feeling that he had
anything less than total respect for
my work. He never decreed that I
had to do things his way or else.

In making an assignment, Rom
would scribble out a schematic in his
unique visual Sanskrit and, with gest-
iculations, make his vision for the
finished piece perfectly clear. It
would also make total sense.

On occasion, I’d bring him more
than just what he’d asked for, and
sometimes Rom would like my idea
better, so he would change his plans
accordingly. This was initially very
satisfying to my ego, but over the
years, I came to view this more as a
sign of a good leader: to be open to
change when someome else comes in
with a better way to do things. I
never got the feeling that I was work-
ing for Rom — I was working with
him.

From time to time, Rom was
known to belt out old jazz standards
in his office, usually when he was on
a roll during a period of intense work.
He could have given Tony Bennett

over four

rendered impassable for days by
even the mildest of showers. Equally
amusing was a claim last year that
our air conditioner couldn’t cool the
apartment very well due to building
design. I even received a bill for $125
in January for a B&G vacuum clean-
er that I had never borrowed. For
these and other classic perfor-
mances, I salute Buildings and
Grounds.

Of all the students I have known
over the last four years, none is as in-
teresting or hilarious as my good
friend Warren Taylor. For quite
some time I have watched the
world’s foremost Anglophile miss
classes, put off an entire term’s work
until the last minute and swoon at the
slightest mention of British royalty.
Once, during the three weeks before
we went on the Glee Club tour to Eng-
land last year, I noticed rows of num-
bers on a piece of paper posted next
to Warren’s calendar. When I asked
him about them, he said, “I’m coun-
ting the hours before we go to
England.”

Despite scant dedication to acade-
mic endeavors, Warren is as capable
as the best students on campus. His
limitless knowledge of good music,
good food, the Church and all things
cultural never ceases to amaze me.
He also throws the best cocktail par-
ties, and he is more fun to waste
valuable study time with than anyone
I know. Three cheers for Warren.

Next, I should like to salute the one
member of the faculty who has im-
pressed me the most over the years.
When I declared my major, I decided
on economics and romance lan-
guages. At that time, I feared that
my boundless ineptitude in Spanish
literature would destroy me in later
years, but that was before I took
Spanish 208 with Dr. Westbook Bar-
ritt. Dr. Barritt showed a bumbling
idiot that literature was not an un-
masterable subject. He was and is
extremely patient in class and al-
ways went to great lengths to help me
understand the material. Outside of
class, he is a fascinating person. He
is an avid gun enthusiast and an ex-
pert marksman, and he always
jumps at the chance to learn new
things. Once, I was chatting with him
about economics and financial mar-
kets and their impact on U.S. policy.
At that time, he seemed to know very
little about the subject, but he en-
joyed hearing about it. During the
next few months, he apparently paid

 

 

 

some competition if he’d set his mind
toit.

Working for W&L was what
brought us together most often, but
my deepest respect and affection for
Rom stemmed from his willingness
to approach my personal work with
complete candor and openness. With
his wry sense of humor and uncanny
expertise at picture-editing, Rom
knew that beauty doesn’t have to be
pretty, that symmetry is not essen-
tial for balance, and that the fashion-
able can be totally lacking of any true
style. And he would say so, if that’s
what he thought.

Rom could always find the time to
look over my latest batch of attempts

years

close attention to the news and did
some reading on the subject. When I
stopped by again, he was informed
not only about the economic matters
we had discussed earlier, but about a
few other new things as well. Dr.
Barritt is a great conversationalist, a
delightful person and a good friend.

Finally, I must salute the entire U-
niversity. Despite a few problems,
it’s a fine school worthy of the highest
consideration. I wish Washington and
Lee, as well as the Class of 1985, good
luck in the years to come. So long,
and vayan con Dios.

from his heart in reacting to what he
was seeing for the first time. He did
this with the joy of a child, as natural-

shake his head and laugh, and other -
times he’d exclaim ‘‘What is that?!”
like he was inquiring into the nature
of something he’d just noticed was
sticking to the bottom of his shoe.

I never knew what he was going to

Waitress
reference
said cruel

To the Editors:

This is to protest a parenthetical
comment in the article of Paul Davey
and Rusty Johnson in the issue of
May 16. It read: ‘‘To sum up, the food
was pretty good, served on real china
(by a waitress that greatly resembl-
eda geriatric nurse)....”’

While the phrase ‘‘geriatric nurse”’
is not clear, I take it to be a deroga-
tory comment about an individual
waitress. I wonder if she read the
article. I wonder how it made her
feel. I wonder what it added to the
story.

As for me, it was gratuitous, cruel
and insensitive, about what one
might expect from a callous knave
but never from a gentleman.

It would appear that Washington
and Lee has, in the case of Mr. Davey
and Mr. Johnson, largely failed in its
mission to cultivate respect for indi-
vidual persons.

To the Editors:

The latest issue of the Washington
and Lee Political Review starts off
with a quote from Lenin. Basically, it
says that the first step in defeating a
nation is to destroy the will of its
youth to fight through ‘‘liberal mind-
ed ministers, professors and lectur-
ers,’’ creating a sense of ‘war hor-
ror.’’ If I may second-guess the Re-
view’s editors, they are attacking
those of us in the United States who
question taking active measures to
resist the spread of Soviet influence
in the world. Lenin and the Review’s
editors are right. To survive, the U.S.
must be willing to fight.

Any nation’s will to fight, especial-
ly a democracy’s, is the sum total of
its individual citizens’ wills to fight.
If they are unwilling to fight, or if ina
democracy just a large enough pro-
portion are unwilling to fight, the na-
tion cannot win a war, and just as
each individual has a role in society,
he (or she) has a role in the collective
will to fight. The quote points out,
therefore, that making individuals
unwilling to assume their roles in the
collective will to fight destroys a na-
tion’s ability to fight. Lenin said that
creating ‘‘war horror’ was the most
successful way to do this. But it is not
the only way

Foul words

To the Editors:

This letter is in response to Mike
Stachura’s comments in his May 16th
column regarding ‘‘NBA Lotto.’’ All
year long Stachura has entertained
us with his insights into the world of
sports. We respect his opinions, but
this time he has gone too far. Sta-
chura supports the lottery system
and states: ‘‘Picking numbers out of
a hat is a lot more constructive than
cheating to lose.”’

We agree that cheating to lose is
wrong. However, the present system
has made the situation worse. Where-
as it used to be two or three teams
“competing” for the first pick, now
there are nine or ten.

Scott Tilley raised an interesting
subject last week when he wrote
about heroes. Naturally we all should
have someone to look up to and to ad-
mire, Next year, with the advent of
coeducation, it will be curious to see
how the women deal with the venera-
tion of Robert E. Lee. I do not believe
that they should take offense. Instead
they have only to look at his wife,
Mary Custis Lee, to find a heroine. A

As young men, we share the most
important role in the collective will to
fight. We are the fighters. Our unhap-
py task is to be ready, and if neces-
sary to do the actual fighting, killing
and dying. Nuclear weapons do not
change this. They reinforce what has
always been true. Nuclear weapons
only make all individuals subject to
dying, no matter what their role in
the collective will. This has made the
U.S.’s wars since the end of World
War II “‘limited wars.’ To keep
everyone from dying, the superpo-
wers avoid directly fighting each
other. But our role has not changed.

In the past, to fulfill our role we on-
ly had to join the military if there was
an actual war. In timeseof peace a
small standing military, relative to
the size of our population, was ade-
quate. The price of peace has now be-
come constant readiness for war. To
do this we have built a large, expen-
sive professional military. For the
first time in U.S. history pay scales
and living conditions are comparable
to non-military professions in order
to attract the best people possible.
This is necessary in having a good
military, and in no way lessens the
commitment of military personnel to
their duties. This is how the U.S. has
decided to provide itself with a mili-

tary. It competes with the civilian
sector for personnel. It does not
obligate us to fulfill our role in the
collective will to fight.

To the best of my knowledge, 31
members of my class will fulfill this
role. After graduation 29 of us will be
in the active Army or Reserves, and
one in the Marine Corps. I am not
condemning anyone who chooses not
to join nor am I condemning critics of
our military. Criticism is necessary
in a democracy and good for the mili-
tary. Through our political system
we have decided on an all-volunteer
military. We are fortunate to live ina
nation where an individual may
choose not to join. I do not want to
make ‘Some corner of a foreign field
that is forever’ America, but I have
joined the military because I believe
it is necessary to enable our system
to survive. But those who do not join,
and thereby do not fulfill their role in
the national will to fight, are hypo-
critical if they advoacate any policy
that will put the lives of American
military personnel or the lives of our
allies’ military personnel in danger.
Do not ask anyone to put himself ina
position to die defending America un-
less you are willing to join him.

A case in point is the Seattle Super-
Sonics. With 15 games to go in the
season, the Sonics were in a playoff
position. However, they mysteriously
lost 12 of their last 14 games. Could
this be because they preferred a
chance to play ‘“‘NBA Lotto’ instead
of a certain first-round playoff loss to
the Los Angeles Lakers? Seattle
claims not. However, consider that
during the Sonics’ year-end skid, per-
ennial All-Star Jack Sikma sat on the
bench for 13 games with a minor in-
jury to his little finger. It is unheard
of in professional sports to play with-
out a star player with a minor injury
during a bid for the championship.

It seems ridiculous that a playoff

wonderful book to read is Mrs.
Robert E. Lee by Rose MacDonald.
It is from this book that the facts of
Mrs. Lee’s life presented here came.

Mary Custis was born on Oct. 1,
1808. Her father, George Washington
Parke Custis, was the grandson of
Martha Washington and George
Washington’s adopted son. Her moth-
er was a cousin of Robert E. Lee.

Her family’s history is rich indeed.
Not’ only did it include her relation-
ship to George Washington, but her
great-great-grandfather, Daniel
Paine, was an aide-de-camp to the
Duke of Marlborough during the bat-
tle of Blenheim.

In 1824, Lafayette paid a visit to her
family and it was then that she fell in
love with Robert E. Lee, who was a
marshal in a parade given in Lafay-
ette’s honor.

caliber team, the Sonics, will pick
fourth (and had a chance of picking
first) while the lowly Golden State
Warriors (perhaps the worst team in
basketball) will pick seventh.

Thus, the NBA Lotto system has
disrupted the balance of power in the

ed ‘‘cheating to lose’ to a greater ex-

s honor Mrs. Lee?

The couple was married on June
30, 1831, and over the years had seven
children.

The years of the Civil War were
hard for Mrs. Lee. Her home at Ar-
lington was ransacked and many val-
uable furnishings were taken. These
included many objects that had been
at Mount Vernon. In addition, her be-
loved husband was indicted by a
grand jury for treason,

Mary Custis Lee never faltered in
her devotion to her husband nor in
her belief that one day the South
would rise again.

She followed her husband to Lex-
ington, where he assumed the presi-
dency of Washington College. Both
husband and wife were inundated
with letters from admirers, and Mrs.
Lee tried to help all those who asked
for aid.

A family who had befriended Gen.
Lee during the seige of Petersburg
fell on hard times. When Mrs. Lee
heard of this she sent them $5. This
money was part of a sum given to her
“for the cause.” The last of the
money was sent to the same family in
order that their two little girls might
have Christmas presents.

She also devoted much of her time
to raising money for the new Episco-
pal church.

That was not all that she did, how-
ever. In a college town it is hard not
to come into contact with students
and Mrs. Lee loved for the students to
visit her. She organized a sewing cir-
cle to make “‘housewives,”’ or sewing
kits, for the cadets at VMI. For the
students at Washington College she
was a mother figure, someone to talk
to. She befriended many students and
encouraged an exceptionally home-
sick boy or one who was far from
home to bring her any mending that
had to be done.

The Board of Trustees of Washing-
ton College wished to provide for
Mrs. Lee’s future should anything
happen to her husband. Both Gen.
and Mrs. Lee declined any help in the
belief that the money could be ap-
plied to educational purposes. The
trustees did not alter their decision,
though.

It was known around campus that
Gen. Lee wheeled his invalid wife
around the porch of their home. Often
a group of students would purposely
walk by the house at this time. It
gave them a time to observe the natu-
ral affection the couple felt toward
each other. On Nov. 5, 1873, Mary
Custis Lee died and was mourned by
the many people whose lives she had
touched. She was born a lady and re-
mained one all her life.

I believe that Mary Custis Lee is
someone who should be remembered
and whose example should be follow-
ed. I am not referring to her sewing
circles or her mending the students’
clothes. What should be emphasized
is her sense of duty, her generosity
and her hospitality. She gave so free-
ly of herself that it is only right that
we remember this woman who stood
by Gen. Lee for most of his life.

Mary Custis Lee was loyal to her
country, by which she meant the
South. However, she was even more
loyal to her way of life. And she wish-
ed to retain as much of it as possible.
Let us hope that next year there are a
few women who desire to follow the
example of Mary Custis Lee.

Students intern under wing
of Eagles Nest, prosecutor

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

An internship, according to Col.
Harold S. Head, University registrar,
is ‘‘on-the-job training for which a
student receives credit’’ (salary is an
employer option).

At W&L, numerous departments
offer internships for upperclassmen,
including the art, journalism, politics
and sociology departments, and vir-
tually all departments offer ‘‘Direct-
ed Individual Study’’ courses. These
courses provide hands-on experience
for the student either in Lexington or
elsewhere that usually is not avail-
able to an individual until he attains
graduate status.

Two internships available to all
students are those under the heading
of Sociology 453. Specifically, they
are positions with either the com-
monwealth’s attorney in Lexington
or with the Eagles Nest Clubhouse in
Buena Vista, an out-patient center
under the direction of the Rockbridge
Mental Health Clinic. Other pro-
grams in mental illness and retarda-
tion are available. Neither internship
requires one to be seeking a law? psy-
chology or sociology degree, and
each involves hands-on experience in
the respective fields designed to
benefit the student regardless of ma-
jor. Each of these internships pro-

vide three sociology credits (no
salary).

Three students are currently in-
volved in these particular intern-
ships. Barry Funkhouser, a junior
psychology major from Lexington, is
with the Eagles Next Clubhouse.
Eagles Nest, according to Marsha
Bedwell, program director, “is a
psycho-social rehabilitation program
for persons with chronic mental ill-
ness under the direction of the Rock-
bridge Mental Health Clinic.”’

Expectations of interns are based
on individual contracts that establish
hours per week and the plan for the
semester. Funkhouser currently is
helping publish a monthly newsletter
and is assisting in the instruction of
an awareness class for diagnosed
schizophrenics. ‘‘They have a right to
know about their illness and how it
can be treated, and this fulfills that
right,’’ Funkhouser said.

A previous intern, Peter Wilbanks,
a senior pre-med major from Sea-
ford, Del., worked developing a
group discussion for counseling men
in their efforts to reacquaint them-
selves with society. Wilbanks still

assists the programasavolunteer. _

The Eagles Nest Staff is very
pleased with the W&L interns and
has high hopes for the future of the
program. The interns themselves,
though apprehensive at first with
normal misconceptions about mental

illness, say they found it highly re-
warding and recommend it strongly
to any interested student, regardless
of major.

Interns for Commonwealth’s Attor- -
ney Beverly C. “John’’ Read work —
closely with the victim-witness coor- _
dinator, the assistant common-
wealth’s attorney and with Read. -
Similar to the Eagles Nest intern- -
ship, individual assignments are tail- «
ored to the individual and to the spec-
ific need at the time. Regardless of ~
specific assignments, the intern will
gain experience in preparing for
trials; going to trial and counseling
victims and witnesses, especially
those who are unfamiliar with the
courtroom environment, procedures
and terminology.

The intern also acquires an under-
standing of The Virginia court sys-
tems, the judicial process, and its in-
teraction with society as a peace-
keeping force. As one law student de-
scribed it, ‘‘it is an experience that
few of us will have until we become
lawyers.”

According to Novack, “It is an
experience that adds to your W&L ed-
ucation as well as familiarizes you
with a system that many people do
not clearly understand.”’

rently participating in the common-
wealth’s attorney internship program.

Sutton would say only that ‘‘the
evidence would vary between some
of them.”

Fraudulent use of a credit card in
an amount of as much as $200 during
a six-month period is a misdemeanor
punishable by up toa year in jail and
a fine of $1,000.

Credit card theft is grand larceny
punishable by a maximum of ten
years in prison. Accessory after the
fact is a misdemeanor punishable by
as muchas a year in jail and a $1,000
fine.

“Credit card fraud of different

 

types is fairly widespread,’’ Sutton
said. ‘“‘We haven’t had too much of it
here, but we have had some previous
cases.”’

Sutton said Shugart cancelled the
credit cards shortly after they were
lost, but did not contact police until
he learned that the cards had been
used without his consent

‘He reported them to the company
and figured that was the end of it, but
then the companies notified him
when the bills came in,’’ Sutton said
“That’s when we got in on it and he
decided he should call us.”’

Sutton said the companies involved
are civilly liable for the charges
because Shugart reported the cards
missing. “I think the credit card
companies are the ones that had the

actual loss,”’ he said.

In other police action this week:

Sophomore John Atkins’ 1984 Audi
4000S was vandalized sometime Fri-
day while parked in the parking lot

Lewis predicts Honor System will survive

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Honor System should survive
the transition to coeducation, Execu-
tive Committee President-elect John
Lewis told a symposium Monday
night.

Responding to a question about a
faculty member who had said the
Honor System would be placed under
a severe strain next year, Lewis said,
““We have been told by this professor
that the end of the Honor System is
near. I intend to prove him wrong.”

Lewis was a member of a four-per-
son panel talking about the past, pre-
sent and future of the Honor System
during a symposium sponsored by
Omicron Delta Kappa, the honorary
leadership fraternity.

Other topics covered during the
wide-ranging 90-minute discussion
included whether such ‘‘pranks’’ as
stealing a road sign should be~con-
sidered honor violations, whether
drunkenness should be taken into ac-
count when determining if an honor
violation has occurred and how the
student body perceives the Honor
System.

When the EC is faced with an honor
case involving a female student,
Lewis said its members ‘‘will be hon-

EC rookies
prepare for

fall challenge

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

 

With the arrival of the first women
this fall, most agree that next year’s
Executive Committee has a big job
ahead of it. However, two of the new-
est EC members say they ‘‘are ready
for the challenge.”

Brad Root and Pat Schaefer were
elected in March to be sophomore EC
representatives next year, and al-
though neither has had any previous
EC experience, both are old hands at
student government.

Root is from Erie, Pa., and he at-
tended Salsbury Prep in New Eng-
land, where he was president of the
student body and played varsity soc-
cer, hockey and lacrosse.

Schaefer is from Memphis, Tenn.,
where he atteneded Memphis Uni-
versity School. He was secretary and
president of the Honor Council, re-
ceived the Senior Leadership award
and played varsity football.

The third new EC member, junior
representative-elect Baltzer LeJeune
of River Ridge, La., is overseas this
semester.

Root said he ran for the EC be-
cause “I’ve always been interested in
this kind of student leadership and
student government and I saw the op-
portunity to get involved in the EC.”

Schaefer said, ‘‘I felt that I could
represent the school as well as the
sophomore class. I wanted to have a
say in what went on at W&L.”’

6 students take
writing honors

Six students received honors for
excellence in writing and scholarship
at the English department’s annual
awards ceremony yesterday.

Four students won George A. Ma-
han Awards in Creative Writing. Ro-
bert D. Bryant and Mark J. Pem-
broke won in the senior prose cate-
gory. Bryant, from Albuquerque,
N.M., was honored for a story titled
“Portrait of the Writer as a Young
Cad,” and Pembroke, from Milwau-
kee, was recognized for his story
“The Parrot.”

Winners in the juniors prose cate-
gory were James A. McLaughlin of
Rockbridge Baths, for ‘‘Native’’ and
John F. Pankow of Asheville, N.C.,
for ‘‘Nothing Ever Happens.”

Frank B. McQuillen, a junior from
Sea Isle City, N.J., received the Jean
Amory Wornom Award for Distin-
guished Critical writing for his paper
“Speaking, Hearing, and Under-
standing in ‘Hamlet.’ ”’

McQuillen was also the recipient of
the Catherine Houston Campbell
Scholarship in English Literature.
Hugh R. Black, a junior from Spar-

orable men, and I think these honor-
able men will be able to distinguish
between honor and dishonor and I
hope gender won’t come into it.”’

The EC will find it difficult not to
overcompensate for the women,
though, warned current Secretary
Sam Dalton, one of about 30 people in
the audience.

“It’s good that you're that idealis-
tic at this point, and I hope you're this
idealistic at this point next year,”
Dalton told Lewis.

Lewis responded that although the
first few decisions involving women
may be difficult, he believes the EC
won’t overcompensate for the wom-
en.

“After about three or four hours of
deliberations, the face begins to turn
gray, the way all the faces do during
deliberations,” he said.

Where to draw the line on honor of-
fenses and whether such acts as
stealing a road sign could be consi-
dered honor violations produced the
most discussion of the evening.

“Those are very, very different
things to cross over,’’ Lewis said.
“There is a very, very fine line
there.”

Current EC President Cole Dawson
said that cases such as those have
been reported to the EC. ‘‘Each case

is decided on its individual merits. If
the end result was going to be theft,
then that could be considered an hon-
or violation,”’ he said.

Lewis said he would view such of-
fenses in a different light because so
many apparently occur but aren’t re-
ported to the EC. “Therefore, they
must not be viewed [as honor viola-
tion] by our generation,” he said.

Pranks should not automatically
be dismissed as not being honor vio-
lations, said Bennett Ross, EC presi-
dent in 1982-83. Once they are report-
ed to the EC, he added, they should
be treated no differently from any
other possible honor violation.

“Tf it’s a question of theft, regard-
less of the object, and if you can
establish intent, then I think the EC
ought to deal with it,’’ Ross added.

Sophomore EC representative and
Vice President-elect Andrew Caru-
thers said from the audience that a
problem could result if each EC
views each act individually.

“The student generation needs to
know what is going to be deemed by
the Executive Committee as dishon-
orable,”’ Caruthers added.

Previous decisions often don’t play
much of a role in future EC decisions,
though, Ross explained.

“There’s a saying that ECs aren’t

Both said they could offer some-
thing to next year’s EC.

“We had a successful honor system
at MUS,” Schaefer said. “‘It could be
valuable to the investigating aspect
of [the one at W&L].”

Each EC member has an obliga-
tion, Root said, ‘‘to take initiative to
bring up student opinions and
thoughts.”

Schaefer emphasized the impor-
tance of fairness with the women
next year. ‘‘We have to look at mat-
ters involving men and women in the
same light,’’ he said. “‘We must judge
each situation separately without sex
playing a factor in our discussions.”’

Both said they agree with Presi-
dent-elect John Lewis (their dorm
counselor, coincidentally) that the
gap between the undergraduates and
the law students needs to be closed.

ODK citation
goes to Mandak

The Washington and Lee chapter of
the national leadership fraternity
Omicron Delta Kappa has given its
Rupert N. Latture Outstanding Soph-
omore Award to Jeffrey Scott Man-
dak, a pre-med student with a grade
point average of 4.1.

Established in 1981, the award is
given to the sophomore who best ex-
emplifies the ideals of Omicron Delta
Kappa, which was established on the
W&L campus in 1914 to recognize
leadership in campus activities —
scholastic, athletic, social, religious
and literary.

The Latture Award is named for
the sole surviving founder of ODK.
Latture, a 1915 graduate of Washing-
ton and Lee, was professor of politi-
cal science at the University from
1920 to 1962.

Mandak is a Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholar in chemistry. He was
named earlier this year as the winner
of the Phi Beta Kappa Sophomore
Award for outstanding scholarship.

PAT SCHAEFER

In addition, both hope to stress the
importance of the Honor System next
year.

“{Students’] allegiance to the
Honor System in the years following
their freshman year will depend on
how well we stress the importance of
it at their orientation,’ Schaefer
said.

Looking at this year’s EC, both new
members say they have ‘‘a good role
model to follow.’’ However, each sees
room for improvement.

‘“‘Each member should have more
respect for other members’ view-
points next year,’’ Root said.

Schaefer also stressed that point.

“Hopefully, that will result in a
more complete committee,” he said.
“Each opinion can be presented,
viewed, and the problem can be seen
from all angles before it is voted on.”’

guided by precedent and that’s abso-
lutely true,’ he said. ‘What each
committee has to do is to look at the
current student generation, look at
the facts and decide if an honor viola-
tion has occurred.”

On the other hand, Dawson said,
problems can result if the Honor Sys-
tem is based too much on the current
student generation.

‘*You don’t try to structure the sys-
tem as to what is going on — ‘Oh,
stealing signs is in this year. That’s
not an honor violation,’ ’’ he said.

ODK Vice President David Size-

dience, said, ‘Stealing a sign was
theft in the 60s, it was theft in the 70s,

* and I think it’s theft now.”’

Drunkenness should not be consi-
dered an excuse for an honor viola-

ists generally agreed.

EC changes White
to ‘gender-neutral’

 

From Staff Reports

 

In a shift from an earlier decision,
the Executive Committee has agreed
to revise the White Book to make the
language on Honor System proce-
dures ‘‘gender neutral.”’

The EC last week had voted to
place a statement in the White Book
noting that ‘‘pronouns such as ‘he,’
‘him’ [and] ‘himself’ are to be under-
stood in their traditional generic
sense as applying to all students,
male or female.”’

On Monday, the committee voted
unanimously to make White Book
pronoun references neutral through
the use of such constructions as ‘‘the
student” and “‘he or she.”’

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, chair of the Co-
education Steering Committee, told
the EC that she objected to the ear-
lier decision to use pronouns ‘‘that
are exclusive rather than inclusive.”

“It was my firm personal convic-
tion that that was not a very good
way to proceed, so I talked with some
people who’d had more experience
with language and publications than
I did,”’ she said.

Simpson submitted letters from
Sidney M.B. Coulling, chairman of
the English department, and Jeffery
G. Hanna, director of the University
News Office, urging the EC to drop
the exclusively male references.

“Our firm belief is that it is possi-
ble to accomplish” gender neutrali-

and placement, headlines, photo-
graphs and overall page design) and
second place for editorial page.

Reporter Ted LeClercq and car-
toonist Chris Bowring won second-
place awards. LeClercq’s award was
for a feature story about professors’
thoughts about exams, and Bow-
ring’s was for a cartoon depicting a
student studying for exams.

Chief Editor Bruce Potter won
third place for an editorial about the
Olden Polynice honor trial at the Uni-
versity of Virginia.

Honorable mentions were won by
Christopher Deighan for general
news reporting, Andy Hoppes for ser-
ies of stories, Mike Stachura for
sports feature story and Stachura
and Steve Greenebaum for sports
news story.

The overall competition was won
by The Breeze of James Madison U-
niversity. Virginia Commonwealth
University’s Commonwealth Times
was second, and William and Mary’s
The Flat Hat was third. In all, 12
Virginia newspapers entered the
competition.

‘Although we had hoped to finish a
couple of places higher in the overall
competition, our awards in a variety
of categories indicate that we can
compete with the top Virginia college
newspapers,” Potter said.

ty, Simpson said. ‘The limitations
are more in terms of the writer than
with the language itself.”

The Steering Committee said in a
statement presented by Simpson that
“to use the terms ‘he, his, and him’
when referring to all students would
convey a subtle message to our wo-
men students that they are not in-
cluded.”

“It is our belief that a disclamatory
footnote would not suffice to over-
come this perception,” the statement
said.

Hanna said in his letter that his
“concern about the language that is
used in the White Book is based on
our desire in the Office of Publica-
tions to develop and maintain consis-
tency in all of the University’s publi-
cations.”

‘Just as we attempted to be consis-
tent in the publications we prepared
for an all-male undergraduate
school, so are we attempting to be
consistent in setting forth our image
as a coeducational institution,’’ he
said.

Coulling said in his letter that he
had counted 67 uses of ‘‘he,”’ ‘‘his”’ or
‘“thim’’ in the White Book, and urged
the committee to change the wording
“if for no other reason than to demon-
strate sensitivity to the issue and the
desire to use language as accurately
as possible.”’

He said he was making the recom-
mendation because he thinks ‘‘it’s
important for us to do everything we
can to make coeducation at Washing-

honor violation. ‘‘I would never allow
{alcohol} to be an excuse,”’ he said.
“If we can establish that he intended
to steal, then he’s using alcohol as a
crutch.”

The EC needs to continue to work
to improve the students’ understand-
ing of the Honor System, Dawson
said.

“The Honor System needs to be
made as personal to the students as

' possible,” he added. ‘You need to

show them the benefits of the system.

ton and Lee succeed” and because he
believes ‘‘that we should try to con-
form to what are increasingly be-
coming national norms in the use of
pronouns.”’

Junior representative Pat Hayden,
who chaired the recent White Book
Revisions Committee, said he earlier
had misunderstood objections to the
use of gender-specific pronouns.

“I was under the impression that
the use of these pronouns was being
argued because it was offensive to
the female reader,” he said, adding
that on that basis he opposed chang-
ing the White Book because he
“didn’t see how they were offen-
sive.”

He said he changed his mind,
though, after talking with Associate
English Professor Jean C. Dunbar.
“‘She used words like ‘inexact,’ ‘inap-
propriate,’ ‘archaic’ and ‘out of
style,’ which are much more convinc-
ing arguments to me,”’ Hayden said

At the 3-hour, 15-minute meeting,
the EC also gave final passage to 16
White Book revisions that were in-
itially approved last week.

In addition, the committee approv-
ed a ‘‘two-tiered”’ transcript policy.
The ‘‘good-standing clause” is de-
leted from the transcript of a student
who either withdraws from school
after being accused of an honor viola-
tion or is convicted of an honor of-
fense. The words ‘‘student not in good
standing’’ would be added if the stu-
dent is also convicted at an open
trial.

Tomaso: ‘baby dean’

Senior Executive Committee
representative and head dormitory
counselor Bob Tomaso has been
named to succeed Bennett Ross in his
position as admissions counselor.

Ross, who graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee in 1983 and was EC
president when he was a senior, has
served for two years in the post
known casually as the ‘‘baby dean”
position. He plans to enter Vanderbilt
Law School this fall.

Tomaso, an economics major from
Milford, Mass., was selected from
among eight or nine applicants, of
whom two were from outside the stu-
dent body, Associate Admissions Di-

rector Van H. Pate said.

Pate said the position Tomaso will
fill is typically held by one person for
one or two years. The job can be re-
newed after the first year.

Tomaso plans a career in manage-
ment or finance and is considering
attending law school in the future.

The Admissions Office has also
named the top officers of next year’s
Student Recruitment Committee.

The chairman is Sandy Whann, a
junior from New Orleans. Vice chair-
men are juniors Chris Alevizatos of
Sparks, Md., and Michael Black of
Shreveport, La.

Terrorists
have goals,
Moss says

By CHRISTOPER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

 

A “collector” of Soviet intelligence
defectors told a Lee Chapel audience
Tuesday that most people in the
United States have a tendency to as-
sociate political terrorism with the
“right-wing nut.”’

But Robert Moss, a recognized au-
thority on espionage and terrorism,
said terrorists have a ‘‘specific aim”
and use their “rational and calcu-
lated tool’’ to achieve their goals.

Moss was a senior foreign policy
writer for the British magazine The
Economist, for which he covered
wars and revolutions in Indochina,
Africa, the Middle East, Latin Amer-
ica and Portugal. He is also author of
‘Death Beam,”’ the best selling ‘“‘The
Spike” and ‘“‘Moscow Rules.”’

In 1981, he told a Senate committee
that a group of Bulgarians, backed
up by Soviets, had a hand in the as-
sassination attempt on Pope John
Paul II bya Turkish hit man.

“The Soviets have a major hand in
international terrorism,”’ Moss said.

Unfortunately, he added, the
media keep the average informed
American ignorant of this fact. He
warned that the Soviets might begin
to ‘rely on our confusion and the lack
of media coverage.”

As an example, Moss pointed out
that both The New York Times and
The Washington Post waited nine
months before reporting his allega-
tions concerning Soviet involvement
in the attack on the Pope.

During that nine-month period,
Moss said, the issue was covered in
most other Western countries. It took
that length of time, plus nine months,
such international coverage and an
NBC News special before the Ameri-
can media would react, he said.

According to Moss, Western spy

speaker Robert Moss adresses a Lee Chapel audience Tuesday night.

services and the media always have
been major Soviet targets of the KGB
and GRU, the first- and second-
largest secret service organizations
in the world.

“The spy business isn’t a silly
game played by people with pervert-
ed intentions...[or] merely a matter
of stealing secrets,”’ Moss said. ‘‘It’s
a matter of shaping the mind.”

But secrets are stolen, too.

Moss mentioned the case of a “‘dis-
illusioned CIA agent” who sold the
Soviets a “billion dollar spy-in-the-
sky satellite for a lousy 3,000 bucks.”’

He said it is much easier for the So-
viets to find sympathizers than it is to
find an American sympathizer
among Soviets. Soviet intelligence
officers, he said, are under constant
pressure to produce results, He told
the story of one such officer who was
assigned to Geneva and told he would
find within seven days a citizen who
was willing to cooperate or be flown

back to Russia where shame would
await him.

The spy world does not always
match the James Bond image, Moss
said. “It is dirty, sleazy and cold,”’ he
said.

Although the Soviet intelligence
services may be the largest, they are
not the most effective, Moss said. He
said a lot of time is wasted on bureau-
cracy.

Moss called the U.S.S.R. itself a
“rotting, decaying empire”’ with ‘‘so-
cial and economic problems it can’t
begin to resolve.”

He questioned the goals of Soviet
leaders in launching an anti-drunken-
ness campaign, claiming that the
scale of drinking taking place in the
country illustrates the common
worker’s need for escape.

“If we stop the Russian worker
from drinking so he can see how ter-
rible things are, he will want to do
something about it,’’ Moss said.

Bookstore charge privileges
reinstated after complaints

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Complaints from students and the
desire to avoid further inconvenience
has led to the reinstatement of
spring-term student charge privi-
leges at the University Bookstore, ac-
cording to University President John
D. Wilson.

Charge accounts had been sus-
pended April 26, several weeks ear-
lier than usual.

After charge accounts were closed,
Wilson said, Executive Committee
President Cole Dawson came to him
with complaints from students. The
change in schedule apparently took
students by surprise, creating a pro-
blem, Wilson added.

Wilson explained that he asked the
bookstore management and the Uni-
versity business office to examine
the situation and determine whether

the charge accounts could be reopen-
ed.

The change in the charge schedule
was announced last summer‘ in a let-
ter sent to students by bookstore
manager Helena W. Roller. In a par-
agraph headed ‘“‘IMPORTANT,” the
letter states: “‘Charge accounts close
in April — Friday after Spring Term
classes begin.”’

In addition to the summer letter,
University Treasurer E. Stewart Ep-
ley said notices announcing the clos-
ing of charges were sent with book-
store bills in both February and Mar-
ch.

Epley said charges were left open
for the first week after spring break
to allow students to charge their text-
books for spring term classes.

Roller said she doesn’t like the
latest change in the charge schedule.

“T don’t like the changes,’’ she
said. ‘‘Things should finish the way
they were set up. I don’t know why

HBOed out?

New cable channel may be offered

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee students
bored with watching HBO and tired
of syndicated television shows such
as ‘Leave It To Beaver’’ and ‘‘The
Andy Griffith Show’ may have the
choice of a new cable channel for
their viewing pleasure.

The Lexington Cable Co. has just
completed a survey of its service in
the area and is considering expan-
ding the number of cable channels to
13 or making available the opportuni-
ty to subscribe to the Music Televi-
sion station (MTV).

Lexington Cable Co. office
manager Juanita Hamm said the
company recently conducted a
survey in which every 10th sub-
scriber was polled and asked to res-
pond to various questions about the

company’s policy and service.

Hamm said that about 250 cable
subscribers were asked about the
company’s quality of service, service
complaints about the cable system,
feelings toward Cable Channel IX
(W&L’s lab station and the Lexington
public access channel), if an expand-
ed service was needed, and what
channels would be preferred if the
cable system were to be enlarged.

The survey results were sent to the
parent company, Mid-Atlantic Net-
works Inc., in Winchester.

Mid-Atlantic Networks will
analyze the survey results and will
determine if the cable services in
Lexington should be expanded,
Hamm said.

Hamm said that the most-asked-
for cable channel among those poll-
ed, especially Washington and Lee
students, was MTV.

they changed it.”’

Epley said the schedule originally
was changed because of problems
collecting bills’ at the efid of the aca-
demic year.

“Students charge up until the last
minute and then take off,” Epley
said. ‘‘Our obligation is to make sure
all the bills are paid on time.”’

He added that the problem is ‘‘not
immense, but it’s enough to make it
bothersome.”

Epley speculated that by the end of
the year students have spent their al-
lotted money but still have other pur-
chases to make.

“They want to take a beer mug
home to Dad, a sweatshirt for a
brother and a cookbook for Mom,”’ he
said.

Slightly less than 60 percent of the
student body uses the charge privi-
lege at the bookstore, University
Controller Robert P. Eversmann es-
timated.

However, the Lexington Cable Co.
cannot expand its services or pro-
grams unless the expansion proposal
is approved by Lexington City Coun-
cil.

If the Lexington Cable Co. receives
the right to expand, it probably would
mean an increase in cable rates,
Hamm said.

The last cable rate increase was in
May 1981 when monthly cable prices
for basic cable went from $7 to $8.

Hamm said she did not know when
Mid-Atlantic Networks would make a
decision on the expansion proposal.

Trustees’ agenda includes
new drug rules, dormitory

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A year ago, in the wake of a special
grand jury investigation of drug
trafficking, the Board of Trustees
asked University President John D.
Wilson to establish a student-faculty
Drug Policy Review Committee.

This weekend, the trustees will
vote on the committee’s proposal.

The policy, approved May 13 by the
faculty, says the school ‘‘does not
condone’’ the possession or use of
drugs or the overuse of alcohol.

Wilson said this week that many
alumni would have found it hard to
accept that a student could be expel-
led from the University for taking 25
cents for a Coke from his roommate’s
dresser but have no disciplinary ac-
tion taken against him for using
drugs.

The proposed drug policy ‘‘clari-
fies the authority of the Student Con-
trol Committee,” he added, and dis-

Wilson said he is content with the
proposal to enlarge the SCC’s power,
saying it is a plus for student autono-
my.

Although hopeful the policy would
reduce the use of drugs among stu-
dents, Wilson said he is not ready to
rule out the possibility that such ac-
tivity will continue.

Also this weekend, the trustees will
discuss the master plan for W&L’s
expected development and, in partic-
ular, listen to architects who have
been working on plans for the new
dormitory on West Nelson Street.

Wilson said costs for the proposed
:residence hall are ‘‘pretty much ball-
park”’ at this point and the board will
authorize a ceiling on indebtedness
for the project.

To raise funds for construction and
planning, the University requested
the Industrial Development Authori-
ty of Rockbridge County to issue $7
million in bonds. The IDA would lend

\

proceeds from the bonds to the Uni-
versity at a nine or 10 percent inter-
est rate.

University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley said W&L will likely borrow
$6.5 million to construct the dormi-
tory.

Wilson said a pool of endowment
funds and revenue from the income-
producing building would pay off the
loan. He said expenses v;ouid not in-
vade the University’s operatiug reve-
nue.

The master plan being reviewed by
the trustees will also point out the
need for additional athletic fields and
will suggest that the Anthropology-
Archaeological Lab, currently hous-
ed on property that is to be the site of
the new dormitory, be relocated in
the old farmhouse near Liberty Hall.

The board’s agenda also includes a
presentation by the Budget and Audit
Committee.

The trustees will discuss and vote
on the 1985-86 budget and will look at
the result of this year’s budget.

of Murray’s service to the school and the students, The
award was one of several given at last night’s Senior
Night ceremonies in Lee Chapel.

Awards highlight Senior Night

Three seniors, three faculty
members and a local resident were
honored during the Alumni Associ-
ation-sponsored Senior Night last
yesterday.

About 300 seniors, faculty
members and friends of the class
gathered in Lee Chapel for the
awards ceremony and a speech by
Dean of Students Lewis G. John. The
ceremony was followed by a cookout
behind the Alumni House.

During the awards ceremony,
senior Cole Dawson was given the
Frank J. Gilliam Award, ‘‘awarded
annually to that student who has
made the most valuable contribution
to student affairs in one or more
fields,” according to the University
Catalogue. Dawson was selected by
the undergraduate members of the
Executive Committee.

Dawson, an economics major from
Houston, is president of the EC and
was an EC representative during his
freshman and junior years.

John received the other EC award,
the William Webb Pusey Award,
given to a member of the faculty or
administration who has contributed
the most to the University during the
previous year.

The EC also gave a special award
to University Proctor Charles F.
“Murph” Murray for his service to
the students. Murray has worked for
Washington and Lee since 1959.

senior representative to the EC and
student representative to the Drug
Policy Review Committee. It was
that last role, however, that led to the
award, as the Phi editors cited
Tomaso’s minority report against not
penalizing the use of drugs in dor-
mitories. His view eventually was en-
dorsed by the faculty. Tomaso, an
economics major from Milford,

Mass., next year will assume the
position of admissions counselor cur-
rently held by Bennett Ross.

The Phi cited Sessoms ‘‘for his
devoted service to Washington and
Lee and its students.’’ The editors
praised his ability to placate the
alumni during the coeducation de-
bate and the transition to coeduca-
tion and his interest in and love for
Washington and'Lee and its students.

Weatherman, cited “for his many
years of devoted service,” was
Publications Director for 17 years un-
til his death earlier this month. The
editors said the posthumous award
was in recognition of the im-
provements he helped bring about in
all of W&L’s publications, His wife,
Clara Belle Weatherman, accepted
the award.

Cunningham was cited for “his
friendship, determination and
courage”’ both in his job at the Lex-
ington Post Office and after his
retirement last fall. Despite a
laryngectomy in 1978 that makes
speaking and breathing difficult,
Cunningham has maintained an ac-
tive running schedule and in October
competed in and completed the New
York Marathon.

Lacrosse: ‘Softer schedule’ key to staying Division |?

Continued from Page 1
make the tournament, I don’t see us
having a chance at getting beyond
the first round.”

Daly, though, does not view the
harsh forecast as the result of any
particular failing on his team’s part.
‘I really think this group of kids and
coaches has done what it takes
across the board,”’ he said.

The problem lies, he explained, in
looking at the scholarship trend and
the effect of the increasing cost of a
college education. Recruiting — in
terms of attracting the kinds of play-
ers that will get a team into the tour-
nament — logically suffers, he said.

Daly said that despite the team’s
effort, the negative effect on recruit-
ing will be difficult to overcome. ““My
sense is that — and maybe I’m too
close to this season right now to feel
otherwise — but my sense is that
we've been banging our heads
against a wall, a brick wall,”’ he said.

Terry Corcoran, head lacrosse
coach at Washington College, a top
Division III program with a team
that beat W&L this season 14-13 in
double overtime, was impressed with
the Generals’ performance that day.
“They played outstanding against
us,”’ he said.

On the other hand, Corcoran also
can see the problems that W&L
faces: “If I were coaching a team
playing Division I lacrosse, I
wouldn’t want to be playing against
the Division I schools W&L is playing
without scholarships.”’

McHenry explained that the major
change in the game came in 1977
when the Atlantic Coast Conference
elevated lacrosse to one of its confer-
ence championship sports. Athletic
scholarships naturally followed,
strengthening W&L’s traditional re-
gional rivals such as the universities
of Virginia, North Carolina and
Maryland.

The result has been an increase in
the prowess of W&L’s opponents
while W&L has remained unchanged.
“The game has not changed,” noted
William N. Clements II, a 1950 all-
American General goalie. ‘“‘Rather,
other universities’ approach to the
game has changed.”’

Since 1977, W&L has made two
NCAA tournament appearances, los-
ing in the first round in 1978 (12-2 to
Cornell) and 1980 (12-4 to Syracuse).
In comparison, the Generals appear-
ed in the tournament in each of the
six years preceding the ACC deci-
sion. Their best finishes were semi-
final appearances in 1973, 1974 and
1975.

The players say they have come to
feel the difficulty of competing
against the Division I scholarship
teams.

“It’s difficult to have the schedule
we've had and to be able to expect to
win them all,”’ said junior defense-
man Chris John, a Lexington native
who grew up during the glory years
of W&L lacrosse and its six straight
tournament appearances.

Senior goaltender John Di Duro,
one of the team’s three captains, said
the season’s losses to Maryland,
Virginia and North Carolina did
become frustrating. ‘It was tough to
have practice on Monday after get-
ting our butts kicked,’’ he said.

for a good Division I program.

Emmer said specific action is
needed: ‘The school has to set up a
system where if a guy has 1,000-plus
on his boards, you’re going to be able
to work with him.”’ He added that the
same practice should also work to
benefit all students with a special
talent — in music, for example.

Emmer was quick to point out,
however, that such a position does
not necessarily lead one down the
slippery slope of scholarship sports,
where the coach becomes, in effect,
the admissions director.

‘A lot of people are fearful that to
commit to Division I means you have
to prostitute yourself and lower your
standards,” he said. “I think W&L
could be competitive without that
happening.”’

Some players feel that some con-
cessions must be made somewhere,
though.

“With the tougher academic stan-
dards, I think some concessions are
going to have to be made down the
line just to keep up the quality of the
program because obviously it’s been
slipping,’”’ sophomore defenseman
T.J. Finnerty said.

Chris John agrees. ‘‘There’s no
question that W&L will have to go to
Division III if we don’t get any help
from admissions,” he said. ‘‘They’re
going to have to look at more well-
rounded individuals. I think we can
stay competitive but we do need help
from admissions.”’

Although W&L’s conflict with ad-
missions and financial aid is a direct
result of its Division III athletic ap-
proach, there appears to be little like-
lihood of change in that philosophy.

W. Michael Hallman, a W&L ad-
missions counselor and the liaison
between the coaches and the admis-
sions department, explained the se-
lection process this way: ‘‘All of our
dealings with lacrosse fall under the
blanket of the Division III philo-
sophy.... We treat lacrosse prospects
the same as other applicants.”’

The same is true for financial aid.
According to Financial Aid Director
John H. DeCourcy, the school tries to
provide the best aid package possible
to all qualified students, especially if
the student is particularly interested
in W&L.

DeCourcy explained, however, that
‘tacademics is the only bias built in’’
to the school’s sytem for awarding fi-
nancial aid.

Freshman Greg Unger, a defense-
man for the Generals, said the in-
troduction of scholarships without
tarnishing W&L’s academic stan-
dards might solve all the problems
but sees that as unlikely. ‘I don’t
foresee them changing,’’ he said. ‘‘I
wish they would.”’

By virtue of its Division I lacrosse
status, the school has the option of
giving all of the aid awarded to a la-
crosse player in the form of a grant
instead of the usual combination of a
grant, loan and work-study job, ac-
cording to Tom Calder, a legislative
services representative at the
NCAA’s headquarters in Mission,
Kansas.

Under this setup, the student-ath-
lete would be restricted to competing
only in lacrosse, because the convert-
ed financial aid package is, in

Daly explains: ‘‘I look out there 4 essence, an athletic scholarship,

and I see what our kids’ effort was
against Washington College and I see
the satisfaction in their eyes and
within the team about the kind of ef-
fort and that good feeling.

“‘T have also seen that team have to
look at themselves after they played
their hearts out against a Virginia
and they lose 17-6.”

Daly said he is prepared to handle
any decision the University makes, \
but “I’m going to need more tools to
coach Division I.’’

Those ‘‘tools’’ would include the
areas of admissions and financial
aid. Daly’s predecessor, Jack Em-
mer, the most successful lacrosse
coach in W&L history and now the

practice on Monday

kicked.”’

head man at West Point, one of the
nation’s top teams, thinks W&L can
remain competitive with the bottom
half of the nation’s top 10 to 15 teams.
W&L’s competitiveness, though,
depends largely on the University’s
administrators, Emmer explained.
‘What I think needs to be done is
for the University to make a commit-
ment to support a Division I pro-
gram,” he said. Only if that commit-
ment to Division I includes help in the
areas of admissions and financial
aid, Emmer said, will W&L be able to
attract the student-athlete necessary

which is prohibited in Division III,
Calder said.

W&L, though, only awards full
grants to students who have received
academic scholarships, DeCourcy
explained.

With these standards, most think
the chances of competing with the
highest level in Division I go out the
window. As Maryland head coach
Dick Edell sees it, ‘In today’s game
with all the grants-in-aid, it’s going to
be damn difficult to compete in the
top eight.’’

Dick Szlasa, who coached the W&L
team in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
agrees that the game has changed
since he was in on the 1971 decision to
go to Division I. ‘‘Scholarships have
made a sigificant difference,” he
said.

Szlasa is not ready to shut the door
on W&L in Division I, though. “I
think it’s cyclical — I think W&L will
come back,’’ he said, noting that the
University’s decision to become co-
educational will help to revitalize the
program.

Others echo Szlasa’s view. Former
all-American goalie Clements has
followed the team’s ups and downs
through the past 30 years and thinks
coeducation may put new life into the
program.

Coeducation ‘‘could change the
type of player we can attract,’ he
said. For example, students from the
many single-sex prep schools in the
Baltimore area who may have not
been attracted to the all-male W&L
may be more responsive now that it
is coeducational, he said.

At present, however, the future
does not appear to hold such promise.
W&L can remain a Division I pro-
gram under McHenry’s second op-
tion — playing a softened schedule. If
the 1985 season can be used as a
gauge, W&L defeated Loyola College
and lost to Towson State University
by one goal, and both teams finished
the year ranked among the top 15 in
the nation. The Generals, though,
also lost 20-6 to Division III Roanoke.

Other losses this year included one
each to Maryland, North Carolina
and Virginia — in a row. Daly ex-
plained the toughness of the 1985
schedule by saying he felt W&L had
to play those top-level Division I pro-
grams ‘“‘to get the recognition that we

were a [Division] I team.”’ A softer
schedule, he added, might put an as-
terisk on any chance W&L might
have of being invited to the tourna-
ment

Jim Adams, head coach at Virgin-
ia, put Daly’s thinking in perspec-
tive. “If the idea is to win a national
championship, you have to play these
teams,”’ he said.

Even though no decisions have
“been finalized, a softer schedule is
already in the works for 1986, accord-
ing to Daly. Included in the list of op-
ponents, Daly said, are three Ivy
League teams. Noticeably absent are
North Carolina and Maryland.

In the Ivies, W&L will be compet.
ing against schools with similar aca-
demic and financial requirements. It
is an idea that some, including Uni-
versity President John D. Wilson,
find appealing.

“I think the key for all of our
athletic relationships should be, to
the greatest extent possible, to be
playing with institutions with similar
academic expectations of their stu-
dents,” Wilson said.

“The most unequal condition of all
would be to be playing against
schools where student-athletes who
really aren’t students become promi-

knowledges, given the choice of at-
tending an Ivy League school or
W&L, most students at present would
choose the lvy League school.

Daly said the Ivy League idea ini-
tially appealed to him, but he now
sees it as a “stopgap.”

“One of two things is going to hap-
pen,”’ he said. “‘Either we’re going to
be successful at it, then the Ivies
won't want to play us, and then we
won't have anybody to play, because
we'll have to go back up to the schol-
arship programs, and we're not
there.

“Or, we’re gonna lose against the
Ivies, if the Cornell game [14-9 loss
this season] is any indication. Then,
so much irreparable damage could
be done to the program, that if you
have three, four, five years of losing
records, when you decide to go to
[Division] III, you’re not going to
have anybody left around here who
can be competitive against III.”

President Wilson said he hopes the
Ivy League orientation is not so pro-
blematic. Although the recruiting
concerns associated with going head-
to-head against the Ivies are real, he
said, other W&L athletic programs
are able to recruit against Ivy
League schools and W&L offers,

nent,’’ he added.

Richie Moran, Cornell University’s
head coach for 17 years, says benefits
of the Ivy League include the tourna-
ment bid an Ivy League school re-
ceives in most years and — surpris-
ingly, perhaps — recruiting.

More importantly, Moran added,
the educational benefits of attending
a top-level academic institution out-
weigh the immediate gratification of
any athletic scholarship.

Unger said W&L is competitive
with the Ivy League-type schools.
“Against the top seven or eight,

among other things, unique advan-
tages such as its prominence in the
South.

Daly disagrees. ‘‘I don’t know how
realistic it is to maintain our same
policies and philosophies and try to
play Division I by positioning our-
selves as a small Ivy, an independent
Ivy, when really what we have is a
very, very competitive Division III
team,” he said.

A further consideration is involved
with the orientation toward the Ivies
and the softer schedule. ‘‘The feeling
is that if we’re going to make the

we’re definitely out of our league,”
he added. ‘When you go past them,
though, I think we’re competitive.”’
Within this concept, as well, there
are disagreements. Even Daly is un-
sure that an Ivy orientation is all that
practical or productive. Travel costs
would be a factor. Also, Daly ac-

tournament, this is the way we're go-
ing to do it, but you would have to do
very well,’’ said John, pointing to
C.W. Post, which was 12-2 this year
but did not make the tournament.
Both John and President Wilson,
however, espouse the view that a na-
tional championship should not be

the only determinant of competitive-
ness. As Wilson put it: ““How many
people play Division I football with-
out any hope of ever winning a na-
tional title?”’

John, a captain on next year’s
squad, thinks the team’s first priority
for 1986 and beyond is to play well
and improve its record. ‘Whatever
the decision, the team’s going to get
out there and get behind it,” he said.

McHenry’s third option, to make
the move to Division III, inspires the

“‘T think the key for all
of our athletic relation-
ships should be, to the
greatest extent possible,
to be playing with insti-
tutions with similar aca-
demic expectations of
their students.”

—John D. Wilson

greatest emotions, as it touches an
intangible but very real part of W&L
— its pride.

W&L historically has done well
against the best Division III has had
to offer. The Generals’ record
against the smaller schools is 37-8 in
the 15 seasons since the NCAA’s
classification decision. A pertinent
footnote to that record, though, is
that in the last three years W&L has
split its eight contests against Divi-
sion III opponents.

Daly applauds the school’s decision
in 1971 to compete in Division I. If the
decision had to be made today,
though, Daly said he doesn’t ‘‘see
how the school could choose to be Di-
vision I.”’

George C. ‘‘Chuck” O’Connell Jr.,
an assistant lacrosse coach at W&L
during the powerhouse years of the
1970s, said he could see the hand-
writing on the wall in the latter part
of the decade. In 1981, O’Connell said,
he and Emmer discussed the possi-
bility of a move.

“We could see that even with all of
our established contacts and the
players we had that it would be three
to five years before we could get back
to where we were,”’ said O’Connell,
now assistant athletic director and
assistant football coach.

The coaches put the question to a
team vote after the 1981 season. Only
one player on the squad voted to
move to Division III, and he changed
his vote to Division I when he was
told that going Division III would
mean W&L could not play in the Divi-
sion I tournament.

Hindsight, though, is always 20-20.
“If you’re realistic about it, we fooled
ourselves,’’ O’Connell said.

Clements, who saw W&L’s perfor-
mance against Washington College
this season, said Division III looks
like the only alternative right now.
“The only thing is, if you move to
Division III, it’s irreversible,” he
said.

The permanence of the decision
rings true to a university that is just
one year removed from agreeing to
admit women for the first time in its
236-year history. It is a fact that
looms large in Di Duro’s mind.

“For all my years at W&L, I’ve
considered Division III to be an op-
tion, but the more I think about it,
once you go Division III, you can’t go
back,”’ the senior tri-captain said. ‘‘I
think we should stay Division I for a
couple of years. The next couple of
years will be the tell-tale years.”’

Daly says that in addition to the
decision’s irreversibility, there is
another misgiving some may have
about Division III.

“No one’s upset about playing a
schedule of Hobarts and Washington
Colleges,’’ he said. “It’s some other
schools that I think people are ¢on-
cerned about and the lack of some
schools on the schedule that people
are concerned about if we went to
[Division] III.”

Others see that same lack of gla-
mour about Division III. ‘I don’t
know if you get the same thrill play-
ing at Western Maryland that you
might get playing at the [Carrier]
Dome in Syracuse, but maybe you
do,’’ Szlasa wondered aloud.

If W&L were to move to Division
III, the Generals would almost neces-
sarily have to join the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference for lacrosse.
With the exception of Roanoke (this
year ranked fourth in Division III),
the ODAC offers little in the way of
top-level competition.

It is in Division III, however, that
many feel W&L would be most com-
petitive. Corcoran of Washington Col-
lege and Virginia’s Adams both feel
W&L would be near the top in Divi-
sion III. ‘“They would certainly have
a good shot at winning the tourna-
ment in Division III,’’ Adams said.

It is the possibility of success that
is the major attration. ‘Everybody

 

 

wants the ring,’’ Daly said. ‘‘It’s not
something that’s automatic [getting
a bid to the Division III tournament],
but it’s more realistic. There’s a
greater chance of success on that
level.’’

Sophomore defenseman Finnerty
is one of those who favors the move to
Division III. ‘I myself would prefer
to go Division III,” he said. “I like
the idea of going for a title and being
able to compete for the top spot.”’

Daly and John both pointed out that
as things are now, W&L has a compe-
titive Division II] team, but that
nothing should be changed with the
program if a move to Division III is
made. Daly said that if a move is
made, the University should avoid
the tendency to think that because
the team is competing on a lower
level, it will need less financial sup-
port.

With the move to Division III also
comes a concern about the effect
such a move would have on athletes
that had been recruited to play Divi-
sion I lacrosse.

Finnerty says he wouldn’t feel
cheated if W&L decided to move to
Division III. “I was looking forward
to playing in Division I, but I guess
I’ve become more realistic,’ he ad-
ded.

O’Connell put the matter in per-
spective for those who feel they
would be betrayed by a change in di-
visions. ‘‘If guys start to say, ‘I’m
leaving,’ where are they going to
go?”’ he asked.

At the same time, the existence of
W&L as an opportunity for the bor-
derline player to play Division I la-
crosse is something that argues for
the Generals to remain as they are.

Clements explains: ‘‘As we go into
the next 10 years, you don’t want to
take away anything that might at-
tract a student to W&L’’

John identified the need to act
carefully. “It’s a shame to give up on
it before it’s dead,”’ he said.

Beyond that, it is more than pre-
sent and future students that would
be affected by any decision. As Mary-
land’s Edell, one who has exper-
ienced the enthusiasm that has ac-
companied W&L lacrosse in the past,
explains: ‘‘There’s a lot of people and
alumni who will die a little bit if they
stop fighting the Division I wars.”

Clements, one of those alumni,
agreed with Edell, but noted that as
with the coed decision, ‘‘they’ll get
over it.’”’

The ramifications of the decision
are as complicated as they are num-
erous. As Cornell’s Moran under-
States: ‘‘It’s not an easy task you
have down there.” Most agree,
though, that a University decision to
commit itself one way or the other
must be made.

With June 1 as the NCAA deadline
for declaring a change in divisions, a

move is not likely for next season, but
as O’Connell said: ‘‘The longer we
fiddle and fool and don’t make a con-
scious decision to do something, the
tougher it’s going to be down the
road.”’

“It comes down to the administra-
tion,’’ Clements said. ‘‘Someone has
to bite the bullet.”

Daly agreed that a choice has to be
made. ‘‘Either there has to be a re-
emphasis and a greater emphasis
given to Division I and say, ‘This is

 

what it’s going to take for us to be

competitive in Division I,’ and come
up with some guidelines, or else say,
‘The way we want to to it...is the way
we've been doing it,’ and then, decide
where that is most competitive,” he
said.

President Wilson said that al-
though he has no timetable in mind,
the issue is not being ignored. ‘I do
concede this: This is not a situation
that can be allowed to drift,” he said.
“The lacrosse world has changed and
continues to change too rapidly.”

The decision rests with the players,
McHenry said. ‘We want to make the
experience valuable for the partici-
pants,”’ he added. ‘“‘We want to strive
to make the playing experience valu-
able and fun and to be able to play at
the highest level possible,”’

Unger, although only a freshman,
perhaps understands the situation as
clearly as it can be understood.

“For me as a freshman, it was
fun,” he said. “You always dream of
playing the best, but I can see that for
~ upperclassmen it would wear
off.”’

“Yeah, it got discouraging some-
times.’’

TIME
OUT...
By Mike
Stachura

  

 

 

 

It is clear that the champ did not dominate ‘‘The Truth” Monday
night. A score of 146-139 means the champ out-and-out was better than
his challenger in 11 of the 15 rounds. Not a terribly lucid deduction,
granted, but certainly one that reveals a decision that is questionable,
at best, unfair, at worst.

Holmes was out on his feet, couldn’t open his right eye after the fight
and didn’t seriously hurt his opponent at all during the fight.

Now, don’t get me wrong. ‘‘The Truth” was no ball of fire, either.
Although he landed more jabs than Holmes knew what to do with, the
unknown-who-became-known checked out after the 10th round.

So, let’s see, we’ve got two fighters, neither of whom was knocking
down any doors to earn the victory. The next question has to be, ‘‘What
were these two doing taking up prime time TV?”

Well, you see NBC had shelled out the dough for a Michael Spinks-
Holmes get-together. When Michael said, ‘‘Well, gee, maybe not,”’ the
Peacock fellas were left with the proverbial all-dressed-up-for-your-
date-when-she-blows-you-off look. Holmes, and he is a champion
(maybe not a winner on Monday, though), came to the network’s
rescue and fought a relative unknown in a fight that got a good deal of
viewers. That is it got a lot of viewers because it was on so long.

The point of all this being that 1) Holmes should not have fought; he
was not prepared and it showed; and 2) when Holmes does fight again,
and some say that could be as many as two more times before
November, it would be worthy of the title of champion that he fight
somebody who's going to make it worth my while to miss ABC’s Mon-
day Night Movie, say a Pinklon Thomas who would stop the champ
after four of his normal boring rounds, or even a Michael Spinks,
whose quickness would cause problems for the old man.

But whatever you do, Marv Albert, tell Ferdie to tell us something
we don’t know....

...A quick trip by the Colonnade, where we have congratulations
galore: First, to tennis all-Americans David McLeod, Chris Wiman
and Andy Haring. For the first two, an idea of what is to come, for Mr.
Haring, a much-deserved reward for four years of exemplary
play...As well, a universal doff of the cap to all those senior athletes
and other ‘award winners at the Sports Awards night on Tuesday. The
glory may not come every week in the papers or on television, it may
never come at all, but the personal satisfaction on a job done to the
best of your ability is something all of you have earned and can keep
long after the headlines are forgotten. ...

...Other topics for discussion: Watch out for Yannick Noah at the
French Open. He won at Il Foro Italico and is playing as well as he can
play on clay...Tired of the USFL yet? Well, now there’s the USBL.
Featured in USA Today (where else? ), the new league wants basket-
ball in the summer. How far away are we from the USHASL, that is,
the United States Hockey from August to September League’...

...Word is that Bernie Kosar’s financial adviser-dentist is chit-
chatting with the Useful League’s Portland Breakers. Nice idea, not.
Seems to me I remember another famous college passer passing up
the NFL, don’t rember his name anymore, though...As much as I hate
to admit it, Lakers will make all that talk of a possible Celtics repeat
seem like drivel...

....And finally, word is Jackie Stewart will not be used during ABC’s
telecast of the Indy 500 on Sunday. Too bad, the Scotsman’s dulcid tone
was the only thing that could ever make watch things going around in
circles for a couple of hours interesting, or at least bearable. But then,
what else would you expect from a network that gave us the intellec-
tually stimulating ‘‘Joanie Loves Chachi’’?...

A pleased Coach Gary Franke said
of the impressive performances, ‘‘It
is a real honor to have three all-
Americans.”’

The three all-Americans marks a
first for W&L as no more than two
Generals have been named to the
team in the past. Ben Johns and
Stewart Jackson achieved the honor
in 1977 and 1978 for the Generals, and
Pete Lovell and Doug Gaker did it in
1981.

In other individual action, Haring
won his first round singles match

Principia’s
Clark claims
D-3 net title

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Toby Clark of Principia defeated
Swarthmore’s Shep Davidson 6-3, 6-1
to capture the NCAA Division ITI Na-
tional Singles Championship on Sun-
day afternoon at the Washington and
Lee tennis courts. Following his sin-
gles match, Davidson teamed up
with Jeff Krieger to win the doubles
title by defeating Redland’s John
Bunch and Roy Chow, 7-6, 6-7, 7-5.

Making very few errors and using
heavy topspin to consistently pass
Davidson at the net, Clark dominated
the first set. From 2-1, he held his
serve twice and broke Davidson
again to build a 5-1 lead. Davidson
did manage to hold his serve to make

' the score 5-2, and showed signs of a

comeback when he broke Clark to
make the score 5-3. Clark, however,
ended Davidson’s rally by breaking
his serve and closing out the first set
6-3.

In the second set, Davidson failed
to make any significant adjustments
to handle Clark’s steady baseline
game.

‘It was a combination of myself
playing well and Shep having an off
day,” said Clark moments following
his victory. He added, “‘I hit the right
shots at the right time.”

The depth of the singles draw was
revealed in that neither Clark nor
Davidson is the number one player
for his school.

Clark, a freshman, said that he
spent most of his season just trying to
qualify for the national tournament
and never really thought about win-
ning the tournament until he arrived
in Lexington. He said, ‘‘When I got
here and saw the other players, I saw
that I could win.”

In the doubles, Bunch-Chow broke
Davidson’s serve in the 10th game to
tie the first set. The teams remained
on serve until 6-6 when they played a
tie-breaker for the first set. Redlands
seized an early 4-2 lead in the tie-
breaker and eventually had a set
point at 7-6, but Krieger-Davidson
fought back and won the breaker 10-8
when Davidson hit an overhead win-
ner on set point.

Davidson opened the second set by
holding his serve. The team from
Swarthmore continued to play well
as they broke Chow’s serve to take a
2-0 lead. Krieger-Davidson had the
opportunity to take a 3-0 lead with
Krieger serving a sudden-death point
at 3-3. Bunch, however, kept his team
in the matoh with a backhand return
down the line that broke Krieger’s
serve and made the score 2-1. The
teams remained on serve until Chow
was broken again on his next service
game to give Krieger-Davidson a 4-2
lead. The Redlands team, however,
answered by breaking Krieger’s
serve and then held their own to tie
the score at 4-4. Once again both
teams remained on serve until 6-6
when they entered the second tie-
breaker in as many sets. Once again
Bunch-Chow took an early lead but
this time they held it and won the
tiebreaker 7-3.

The third and final set resembled
the first two. Chow had his serve
broken in the third game and Krieger
held his to give his team a 3-1 lead.
Bunch-Chow, however, got the break
back against Krieger and tied the set
score at 4-4. Bunch then held serve
and the Redlands team suddenly led
5-4. With Davidson serving a sudden
death point in the next game, Bunch-
Chow had a match point but failed to
convert it and the score was once
again tied at 5-5.

Krieger-Davidson then broke
Chow’s serve for the fifth time in the
match and took a 6-5 lead. Krieger
held his serve and Krieger-Davidson
had won the match that had lasted
for two hours and six minutes.

College radio: You can still be

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

If you’ve been listening to WLUR-
FM this spring, you may have notic-
ed a change in the afternoons
— namely, more contemporary mu-
sic on ‘‘Afternoon Rock.” The radio
students have led the way in bringing
you the music of 1985. Believe it or
not, there are lots of good bands mak-
ing music all over the world. Not only
are international boundaries mean-
ingless to these artists, but the labels
with which music critics convenient-
ly pigeonhole artists are equally

inadequate and meaningless.

This is where college radio and
WLUR fit in. Nowhere else are non-
mainstream musicians and artists
allowed to be heard by a larger au-
dience; college radio is it. An after-
noon rock jock has the unequalled
freedom to program his (or her)
show to explore almost any music
with a beat. The difficulty, and the
listener’s reward, lies in the dj’s
showing where these musics arose
and in showing the musical continui-
ty to the listener. Before U2 there
was Dylan; before Dylan there was
Little Richard (his early inspira-
tion). Any artist worth a damn ab-

Chicago drama critic praises
Martinez stage combat

In a review appearing in the May
issue of Chicago magazine, a Chicago
drama critic has praised the fight
choreography of Associate Drama
Professor Joseph Martinez.

Martinez, a specialist in chor-
eographing stage combat, was the
choreographer for a recent produc-
tion of ‘Hamlet’? by the Wisdom
Bridge Theatre Company.

Wrote drama critic Lenny Klein-
feld: “The closing dual between
Hamlet and Laertes. . .was among
the best I’ve ever seen. It began with
a flashy but mannerly flicking of
blades, then convulsively expanded
into a bloodbath — not only the prin-

cipals but half the bystanders as well
were slaughtered; Elizabethan
luridness amplified by graphic
modern experience with political kill-
ings.”

Martinez is currently staging
classic sword duels in a stage adapta-
tion of Alexander Dumas’ ‘‘The
Three Musketeers,’’ which is being
presented by the Heritage Repertory
Company at the University of Virgin-
ia this summer.

This summer he will conduct an ad-
vanced workshop in the stage combat
arts at his private academy in the
Blue Ridge Mountains.

Burt Reynolds once
again on the ‘Stick’

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page” Editor

 

You've got to hand it to Burt
Reynolds — he never gives up.

Burt started out in the movie busi-
ness playing real tough guys in shoot
‘em up police stories. Then he disco-
vered Sally Field, Coors beer and the
car chase movie. In many of his most
recent efforts, however, Burt has
been struggling to come up with any
really good follow ups to his car
chase flicks.

Burt is back in the tough-guy mold
now, playing ex-con Earnest Stickley
(known to his buddies as ‘‘Stick’’) in
the movie bearing his nickname.

The plot of the movie is not one we
all haven’t seen somewhere at least
once. Ex-con gets out of prison,
meets up with an old buddy from the
good ole days. Said buddy gets gunn-
ed down by some baddies during a
drug money delivery and said ex-con
sets out to revenge the death of his
fallen comrade.

We also get to see the emotional
side of Stick as we are introduced to
his daughter, who grew up while
Stick was in the slammer. Cute girl,
but it becomes too obvious too quick-
ly that her main purpose in the plot is
to be used by the bad guys to put lev-

sorbs everything, even influences
that may not be readily apparent,
and tries to find and project his or her
own voice.

A good programmer aspires to pre-
sent his listener not only with who is
hot, but with the performers who
lighted the fires under them. The
cream of the new will rise, and inevit-
ably these will be the artists who
know their roots and strive to add
their branches to the tree. Leave the
pigeonholes and labels to MTV and
the commercial FM’s; there are
plenty of ‘‘safe’’ outlets for musi-
cians who are willing to play by the
rules. College radio is the only place

erage on dear old dad.

The film moves slowly at first, but
picks up steam by the end. It also
owes a good deal of its success to the
fine cast surrounding Reynolds.

Charles Durning plays a fat-boy
drug dealer who knocked off Stick’s
buddy. George Segal plays an eccen-
tric millionare who hires Stick as his
chauffeur. Candice Bergen has a
small role as Stick's love interest, but
a small role is plenty enough as
Bergen remains one of the most
watchable faces on the silver screen
today.

Reynolds also does an admirable
job of pulling off the tough-guy im-
age. One item I felt was noteworthy:
Stick goes out of his way not to use a
firearm during most of the movie.
Then the bad guys push him too far
and he breaks bad with barrages of
automatic weapon fire.

“Stick”’ is, overall, an entertaining
movie that is worth the price of ad-
mission. You will have to move
quickly, though, if you want to see it
in Lexington. Tonight will be the last
night you can catch “Stick” at the
State Theatre. The State will begin
showing ‘‘Just One of the Guys’”’ to-
morrow, and the Lyric will begin
shows of ‘‘Code of Silence’ on the
same day.

surprised

where you can still be surprised by
what’s coming out of the speaker.
Who knows; you may be like Janie —
“her life was saved by Rock and
Roll.”

So listen to WLUR, now and next
year, for radio that is vital, interest-
ing and occasionally inspirational.
Not just rock, either; jazz, blues,
folk, soul or whatever label you like;
WLUR has them all. You’ll hear the
connection between who’s who and
who was_ who and be able to hear
who’s next. As Bob Marley said,
“One good thing about music, when it
hits you feel no pain.” Treat your
ears right, and keep the dial on 91.5.
