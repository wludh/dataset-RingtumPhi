Goshen apparently was named aptly.

In ancient Egypt, a fertile valley of the same name
was valued because of its agriculture and grazing.

The pharaohs, however, did not like the valley be-
cause of its distance from the lifeblood of the times, the

Nile River.

Asimilar complaint was voiced this week by a Wash-
ington and Lee student, one of many who have enjoyed
the sun, rocks and water at Goshen Pass, Virginia, dur-

ing the recent 90-degree heat.

The only problem with Rockbridge County's Goshen,
though, is the 20-minute drive from the Washington and
Lee campus, according to senior Mark Pembroke.

Nevertheless, Pembroke sees a possible way to re-

sentenced
for forgery

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A former Washington and Lee stu-
dent was convicted yesterday of forg-
ing an $1,800 check and of cashing a
$500 check that did not bear his
name.

The former student, William Addi-
son Vaughan Jr., pleaded guilty to
the charges and was given a two-year
suspended prison sentence for each
charge by Rockbridge Circuit Judge
George E. Honts III.

Honts also placed Vaughan on pro-
bation for four years and ordered
him to make restitution of the $2,300
to the Lexington branch of United
Virginia Bank.

Vaughan was a senior at Washing-
ton and Lee in 1983-84 but has not
received a diploma from the school.

The $1,800 check was drawn May
24, 1984, on the account of James Ed-
ward Abbe IV, who graduated last
spring. Abbe was described by Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read as having been a ‘‘very
close’ friend of Vaughan. The $500
check also was drawn on Abbe’s ac-
count.

The Nov. 5 grand jury indictment
against Vaughan listed four counts:
one of forging and one of uttering on
each of the two checks. The charges
of the uttering of the $1,800 check and
the forging of the $500 check were
dropped.

says party rules

can now be loosened

 

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council was
told Tuesday night that in the future
the Board of Trustees plans to be less
specific in the social regulations it
imposes on fraternities.

‘‘We now have a chance to change
the rules,” IFC President Jaimie
Hayne said, although he qualified his
statement by adding that ‘‘we won’t
be able to return to the system of no
control.”

The Student Affairs Committee,
which is composed of students and
faculty, would have to approve any
IFC recommendation.

The trustees had said at their Oct-,

ober meeting that endorse any
changes in the fraternity party regu-
lations that took effect this fall
because the board had approved
plans for the student activities pavi-
lion with the understanding that the
new rules would be in place.

“Those were basically their rules
and nobody could change them but
the board,’’ Hayne said after the

SAC OKs Rush

ations the Rush calendar for next

meeting. ‘‘They’ve decided to move
away from making rules like that for
us and they want to adopt a general,
overall policy and SAC will be oper-
ated within that policy.”

Hayne urged fraternities to discuss
what changes they might like to see
in Wednesday night party regula-
tions, since that will be the main
agenda item at Tuesday’s meeting.

“One of the main changes may he
that hopefully we’ll get away from
the one-house rule so that two houses
can party together,”’ he said after the
meeting.

He told the IFC that another possi-
bility is for fraternities to be allowed
to have two Wednesday night parties
a month.

Hayne said he hopes to have a re-
commendation on new rules ready
before next month’s board meeting.

In other action:

eHayne warned fraternities about
putting up posters for Wednesday
night parties. He said there is a $50
fine for the first offense, since the
parties are supposed to be spontan-
eous.

eHayne said he plans to make at-
tendance at IFC meetings manda-
tory for fraternity presidents be-
cause different representatives have
been coming to every meeting.

When Hayne suggested levying a
fine against those failing to appear,
Assistant Dean of Students Dan. N.
Murphy intervened and said that al-
though the plan is ‘‘a good idea,”
“there should be an amendment to
the constitutional bylaws”’ before it is
put into effect.

The price of selectivity: Rejections are ‘increasingly difficult to explain’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Washington and Lee’s choosiness
in admissions this year was second in
the state only to that of the Universi-
ty of Virginia, according to an infor-
mal survey of key Commonwealth
colleges and universities.

The academic powerhouse in Char-
lottesville accepted 25 percent of the
students who applied for undergrad-
uate admission for next fall, W&L
gave the green light to 30 percent of
its applicants and the College of Wil-
liam and Mary took 34 percent.

W&L’s applicant pool was up 75
percent compared to the previous
year, allowing the school to be con-
siderably more selective than last
year, when it admitted more than 60
percent of applicants.

As an example of the more strin-
gent standards, students offered ad-

mission for next fall have an average
combined Scholastic Aptitude Test
score 92 points higher on a 600-point
seale than the average for this year’s
freshman class.

“The turnaround this year has
been remarkable,’’ Admissions Di-
rector William M. Hartog III said.
“It's put us in a very strong posi-
tion.”’

With heightened _ selectivity,
though, comes an increased number
of disappointed high school seniors
and parents, and Hartog said people
frequently try to second-guess the ad-
missions office and ask for an expla-
nation or reconsideration

“Acceptances went out on Friday,
the 29th of March,’’ Hartog recalled
“On Monday the first, the phone

started to ring. It rang and rang and
rang all the way through the first
week of April.”’

Hartog said such a reaction is to be
expected ‘“‘when you consider the

kind of student denied admission
here,” and he added that usually
“people are quite understanding.”’

“Ninety percent of the people just
want to inquire and are genuinely in-
terested,”’ he continued. ‘‘There is a
very small percentage who are down-
right angry.”

Hartog said it’s frequently difficult
to articulate the reasons a particular
applicant was offered or denied ad
mission. ‘In a highly selective pro
cess like ours, in many cases the dif-
ferences between these students are
not that obvious,’ he explained

“It becomes increasingly difficult
to pick up a folder and explain to a
parent why his son or daughter was
not admitted,’ he continued. ‘‘In
many cases these judgments are
very subjective....Many times, it’s
how well the student presents his or
her case.”

University President John D. Wil

son said he occasionally receives

calls, usually from alumni, asking
him to review admissions decisions.
He said there have been ‘‘more this
year than before”’ and that ‘‘certain-
ly as a matter of courtesy’’ he re-
sponds to such requests.

‘These were very, very thoughtful
calls — no sense of pressure or

something unfair going on,’’ Wilson
said.

“One thing is very clear, and that
is that our capacity to choose talent
has been markedly increased,” he
said. ‘‘Our university has attracted
this year a very academically strong
group — that’s all there is to it.”’

41 applicants taken from waiting list

The admissions office on Friday
and Monday moved 41 applicants for
admissions from the waiting list to
the acceptance pool, but now plans to
accept no more until after the Wed-
nesday deadline for enrolling.

‘That was expected,’’ Admissions
Director William M. Hartog HI said
of the offers to students who had been
“‘wait-listed.’’ He explained that the
admissions office ‘‘purposely came
in from the low side’’ with initial
acceptances in order not to exceed
the 400 it can enroll in next fall’s

freshman class

“There is no resemblance between
those taken from the wait list this
year and last year,’’ he said, adding
that the students were of such high
quality that the admissions staff ‘‘ac
tually hoped we'd be able to go to the
wait list.”

With just under a week remaining
for students to enroll, the Admissions
Office this morning had received ac-
ceptance checks from 270 students
198 men and 72 women. The goal is a
class of 300 men and 100 women
 

 

 

 

OPINION

Page 2
April 25, 1985

 

Spring:

Worth a term?

The typical student’s reaction to the thought of beginning a
new regimen of studying, attending classes and preparing
papers during the spring term would follow something like
this:

‘Hit the books? You must be crazy! No gentleman would
ever dare crack a text when the sun is in prime tanning posi-
tion, the store has a special on 12-packs and the road to
Goshen lies waiting. This is spring term — not study time.
Get out the shorts, unpack the polo shirts, crank back the
sunroof and let’s have a good time for six weeks! ”’

Unfortunately, that seems to be the attitude many students
have for the final term. Warm weather means party time, not
academic time. The realization that professors actually re-
quire work from students in the spring comes too late to
remedy any deficiencies up to that time. What is to be done?

First, there is something illogical about the concept of a
spring term. Sure, professors can organize those neat semi-
nars on topics that otherwise would not warrant a full term’s
study. Yes, some students are able to use the time to study
abroad instead of taking off a full or half of an academic
year. Granted, classes tend to be smaller, the students get to
know the professors better because of the smaller class size.
Indeed, the intense study for six weeks lends itself to greater
retention in the long run. On the other hand, do these reasons,
among others, warrant the six-week academic burp at the
end of 24 weeks of lectures, papers, tests and finals?

The question, it seems, is whether the so-called 12-12-6 cal-
endar really serves everyone well. While we are told that pro-
fessors enjoy the spring term, all we hear the first few days
: of classes is how short the term is and how it will not allow as
' detailed a study of the topic as is necessary. We hear how
rushed things will be, and how critical it is that students at-
tend every class. We hear from the professors how they
realize that half of the class will only attend a quarter of the
lectures and how those students will fail. In short, we are
continually subjected to recitations of how much professors
detest spring term.

Students also find themselves in disagreement over the six-
week study period. While it does allow for six weeks of rela-
tive ease and party time, it also places many students at a
distinct disadvantage when it comes time to search for the
summer job or internship. Employers are looking for stu-
dents to begin work at the end of May — not the middle of
June. Also, some students lose money on summer apartment
leases because of the odd timing of the end of classes.

It seems, then, that an alternative to the present calendar
should be found. Such a move is long overdue. A ‘‘15-15’’ cal-
endar or even a trimester calendar are two possibilities that
might result in more productive use of future academic time.

But searching for a new calendar to cure the woes of spring
is not all that should be done. Students need an attitude
change as well. We need to realize that spring term, while br-
inging lighter academic loads, also carries with it a certain
burden of responsibility for students. The spring calendar
says that we can overcome the temptations to blow off
reading that 699-page novel on the ancient voodoo practices
of Inner Mongolia or writing that 35-page paper on the effect
of ether on the develpment of motor skills in mice and
achieve new heights of academic grandeur if we are as
mature as we say we are. It places a certain amount of con-
fidence in our ability to make the right decisions. It entrusts
us with the responsibility we desire.

This spring term, students, faculty and administration
need to reconsider the idea behind the final weeks of study.
Whether it serves any of us as well as we think it does re-

mains to be determined. aly Nolaon Pattanein

With spring term comes the
opportunity to experience another of
Washington and Lee’s most popular
traditions — the popes course with
Dr. Futch.

About 10 percent of the school —130
students — is enrolled in the course,
which has outgrown the historical
confines of Newcomb Hall and relo-
cated in Parmly.

And, amazingly enough, all 130
students continue despite the re-
quirement that they wear the much
maligned....dare I say it....necktie.

And, though many will disagree,

Disinvestment alone spells disaster

MY
VIEW

 

By Jon
Zagrodzky

On April 3, I was fortunate enough
to attend a film and discussion ses-
sion held by the Washington and Lee
Campaign Against Apartheid. The
film gave a startling account of the
abominable cruelty characteristic of
the apartheid system in South Africa,
and the subsequent discussion re-
vealed well-informed concerns of
those in attendance. While the films
proved to be invaluable sources of in-
formation concerning apartheid, I
found the ideas and proposals enu-

merated thereafter to be somewhat
less useful. Before I discuss why, I
will first recount some of my obser-
vations on the issue.

At present, there seem to be two
factions dealing with the apartheid
question: those who demand the eli-
mination of the system, and those
who fear instability and damage to
U.S./South African relations should
the system (and the government) be
overthrown. The first group, which
includes the W&L Campaign Against
Apartheid, seeks to force the govern-
ment and businesses, through pro-
tests and disinvestment plans, to cut
off dealings with the South African
government and thereby speed the
demise of apartheid. The second
group, while it may condemn apar-
theid as unjust, prefers to pursue
constructive engagement and do
nothing to curtail the almost Nazi-

like treatment of South African
blacks. Personally, I find myself
committed to the destruction of not
only apartheid, but all other sources
of oppression and injustice as well.
The question is, why am I unable to
support wholeheartedly the conven-
tional anti-apartheid forces in this
country?

I think the answer lies in my dis-
taste for their methods rather than
their goals. The U.S. anti-apartheid
groups have proposed various disin-
vestment schemes, whereby they
would force organizations with which
they are affiliated to sell their in-
vestments in companies that do busi-
ness in South Africa. It is believed
that this would force U.S. companies
to shut down their South African
operations, thus bringing economic
pressure to bear on the South African
government. South Africa, however,
could easily encourage more invest-
ment from Europe and Japan to re-
place lost U.S. investment should this
plan succeed. U.S./South African
relations would evaporate, U.S. cor-
porations and citizens would lose

money and this ‘‘economic embar-

go" would ve about as ciucctive
against apartheid as the U.S. grain
embargo was at getting the Soviet ar-
my out of Afghanistan. It seems that
these disinvestment schemes would
be useless gestures even if they did
succeed in forcing U.S. companies
out of South Africa.

My greatest concern, however, is
with the. South African groups that
American anti-apartheid forces sup-
port. Bishop Desmond Tutu and the
Africa National Congress both be-
lieve that violence will eventually be
needed to destroy apartheid. Unfor-
tunately, they don’t tell us what is to
come after apartheid. Every indica-
tion is that a dictatorship of some
sort will be formed, as has been the
case in every sub-Saharan African
nation that has achieved “freedom.”
It is instructive to observe how well
average folks are doing in these other

nations before we encourage the
same destiny in South Africa.

Most of the nations are dominated
by ruthless Marxist dictatorships.
Nations once able to feed themselves
are no longer able to do so, and mem-
bers of legitimate opposition parties,
like Joshua Nkomo in Zimbabwe, are
terrorized and forced to flee their
country. The tyranny of minority co-
lonial dictatorships has been re-
placed with equally oppressive black
dictatorships, with no improvement
in the lot of of ordinary people, black
or white.

Herein lies my difficulty with anti-
apartheid forces. Their goal is the eli-
mination of apartheid (a noble task),
but their motives are purely racial. It
does not matter to them that a new
South African government would
murder people and confiscate pro-
perty, just so long as the killing didn’t
discriminate between races.

I think that in order to properly
voice my abhorrence of apartheid, I
should form a third faction to deal
with the problem. This group would
seek the overthrow of apartheid by
evolutionary rather than-revolution-
ary means, and would also ensure
that the end result was freedom and
justice for all the people in South
Africa. It would decry organizations
that seek to rationalize apartheid as
well as others who are interested on-
ly in the destruction of apartheid and
not the eventual well-being of all
South African citizens. Clearly, the
goals of this new group would not on-
ly be justifiable from a U.S. foreign
policy standpoint, but would also be
desirable by anyone who supports
true freedom.

The problems in South Africa are
enormously complicated, and I don’t
pretend to have all the definitive an-
swers to these or other political ques-
tions. If I did, I would be king tomor-
row. In any case, I would urge any-
one who has an interest in this issue
to attend tonight’s meeting of the
W&L Campaign Against Apartheid.

the dining hall. In an age in which our
generation is accused by elders, pro-
fessors and others ad infinitum of be-
ing apathetic, one could not help but
feel that these guys were taking their
studies seriously.

It was gratifying to visit a place
where traditions die hard.

After last year’s occurrences,
chances are slim that such days will
ever occur again here at our red-
bricked and white-columned sanc-
tum. But let’s not give up hope. The
Executive Committee made a val-
iant, albeit doomed, effort last year.
Maybe the future carries some hope.

George Will used ‘‘The Great Tie
Fiasco” last year to extoll its virtues,
speak positively of today’s younger
generation and long for the soon-to-
be days when spring breaks will be
spent in Madras attire in liberated
Havana.

Despite other’s arguments, I be-
lieve the tie is a mark of a gentleman,
not the mark of a fascist.

And what’s wrong with an assimi-
lation code, anyway?
*_ * *

With all due respect to Prof. Stene,
when is that funky-looking slate thing
going to be removed from the lobby
of the library?

I mean, seriously, it looks like part
of the ceiling caved in and because of
an effort to cut library maintenance
costs, it hasn’t been cleaned up or re-
paired. Natural lighting or some-

ing?

I claim to be no connoisseur of mo-
dern art, but really, guys. Slate is
slate is slate. Are those holes signifi-
cant, or did the slate just not fit snug-
ly together?

Actually, the library lobby is an

amazing contrast in art forms. On
the traditional side, above the stair-
way hangs the Father of Our Country
(and University), and along the walls
are stately portraits of great states-
men like Washington, Madison, Mar-
shall and Zac Taylor.

And then there are those four cloth
things of the trees with something
— roots, snakes or something — pro-
truding upward. And what is that
thing in the corner — the modern
sculpture cleverly (and ambiguous-
ly) titled “Working No. 1’’?

Or what about when you walk into
the C-School? Greeting you is some
mixture of black, blue and red colors
that form nothing.

I’m not one of those guys who
searches for the meaning of life in
everything. I can listen to the radio
without exploring the deep implica-
tions of each song. But I like things to
make a little sense....just an inkling
of sense.

Like those pictures hanging in
front of Carole Chappell’s office. She
has stared at those things for years
and still can’t figure them out.

My bet is that any. monstrosity you
see on campus can be traced to a do-
nation by some alum with a chip on
his shoulder toward us. What a way

To the Editors:

I simply want to voice my final
impressions of the Washington and
Lee atmosphere as a departing sen-
ior. It has been a rewarding exper-
ience, though turbulent. I have a few
regrets in my four-year stay here. I
gladly welcome the change to coedu-
cation as a signal that the school will
be joining the world in the 20th cen-
tury. As a black student, I think I had
a pretty good idea of what I was sub-
jecting myself to socially, but I did
allow cynicism to creep into my
attitude nevertheless. I believe I
have reached a point, however,
where I have risen above the circum-
stances not only in academic adequa-
cy, but in exuding a more positive at-
titude. I only hope more of my
‘‘peers’’ can or will reach this level.

Spring brake: Varied vacations come to a halt

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Although temperatures in Lex-
ington last week reached the low 90s,
many Washington and Lee students
left town in search of sun, sand, sea
and other spring break pleasures
Florida and other southern points
remained favorite destinations for
most vacationers.

Among those who made the trip to
Florida last week were two groups of
Students who rented motor homes
and drove them to Ft. Lauderdale

“We did it [rented the motor home]
because we thought it would be
cheaper,’’ said junior Rusty Johnson,
who went with six fraternity brothers
in one of the recreational vehicles,
“but it turned out to be a losing stunt.

We figured that it cost us more than it
would have cost to spend a week in
the Bahamas.”

Johnson said the group thought it
could save money on hotels and that
it would be convenient to have the
mobility a motor home would give
them.

There were certain advantages to
the mode of transportation the group
chose. ‘‘It was nice to be able to drink
the whole way down to Florida,” he
added, ‘‘and not to worry about driv-
ing.”

Another group of students went to
Florida, but only briefly. Nine sen-
iors from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fra-
ternity stopped in Cocoa Beach for a
party on their way to Cancun, Mexi-
co. The party was not a run-of-the-
mill affair. On the day the group was
passing through Cocoa Beach, a

Space shuttle launch was scheduled
at nearby Cape Canaveral

The group arrived in Cocoa Beach
early on the morning of the launch to
find breakfast waiting at the house of
senior Andy Best, one of the Cancun
bound travelers. He had alerted
his mother and arranged for her to
prepare omelettes, doughnuts and
coffee. Just before the launch, Best
said the group mixed screwdrivers
and Bloody Marys and walked to the
boardwalk to watch the shuttle blast
off.

After the lift-off, Best said. it was
back to the cars and on to Miami to
meet their flight to Mexico and pro
ceed with what he called a ‘“‘low-bud
get, high-fun program.”’ Once in Can-
cun, Best said the group spent its
time on the beach, touring Mayan
ruins, snorkeling and deep-sea fish

Four seniors receive scholarships

At least four Washington and Lee
seniors will continue their studies
next year free of charge after receiv-
ing graduate fellowships or scholar-
Ships, administration officials
report.

G. Bryan Balazs, David F. Connor,
David L. Harrar II and Marc F. Mon-
yek will be studying as close as
Charlottesville and as far away as
Germany.

Harrar received a _ National
Science Fellowship, which will pay
for his three-year study of applied
mathematics at the University of
Virginia beginning in the fall.

The fellowship will pay $6,000 each
year for his tuition and other ex-
penses, Harrar said, and he will re-
ceive an $11,000 stipend each year.

The fellowship does not guarantee
a job, Harrar said, and he will not be
responsible for any post-graduate
work.

“They’re trying to increase highly
skilled people in the country,’ he
said.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, a member of
W&L’s Committee on Graduate Fel-
lowships, called the award ‘‘pretty
prestigious.”

Connor is one of 500 college stu-
dents who received a Fulbright
Scholarship for graduate study in
nearly 58 foreign countries,

SE aan,

At the University of Bonn in West
Germany, Connor will conduct an in-
dependent study of the political im-
plications of rapidly declining birth
rates. His program will be supervis-
ed by a professor of the political
science department and possibly by a
faculty member in the sociology de-
partment.

The program, partially sponsored
by the German Academic Exchange
Service, will begin in September
when Connor will stay with a host
family until classes begin — in Ger-
man — on Oct. 1.

The nine-month academic year,
which is fully paid for by the Ful-
-bright award, will end in the last
week of July.

In 1983, Connor studied in West
Germany with German instructor
Marshall K. Follo for the spring
term.

Simpson said the West German
government is very supportive of for-
eign exchange programs.

Monyek learned last May that he
had received a Rotary Graduate Fel-
lowship from Rotary International, a
network of local civic clubs. Monyek
was one of five recipients selected by
the Lake Forest, III., district from
among 30 semifinalists and 15 fina-
lists.

“The stars must have been lined up
right,” he said.

Monyek will study graduate econo-
mics at St. Andrew’s in Scotland. As
a recipient of a Rotary Fellowship,
Monyek is expected to act in the dual

Washington: First in war, peace, pocketbook

biggest news story to come out of Washington and Lee this
decade would be last summer's coeducation decision. That
announcement was covered in such places as The New York
Times and The Washington Post and on Cable News Net-
work.

This weekend, however, a story from here landed on the
NBC Nightly News, the CBS Morning News and on the front
pages of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and USA Today.

It seems appropriate that the former Washington College
would be the source of some startling new information about
“father of our country.” Did George
Washington marry for love? Possibly. New evidence shows,
however, that the bottom line is that the Widow Custis was
loaded.

Confused? University News Office Director Jeffery G.
Hanna explains what all the fuss is about:

the so-called

What one noted scholar calls ‘‘the most important ad-
dition to George Washington’s material in more than a
generation’ has been discovered at Washington and
Lee. .

The find consists of 36 leaves of an account book that
documents Washington’s administration of Martha
Washington's first husband’s estate and the guardian-
ship of the heirs of that estate.

The ledger provides scholars with important informa-
tion about Washington’s finances, his accounting prac-
tices and the contents of the Custis properties.

According to Richard W. Oram, W&L’s reference and
public services librarian, the discovery of the ledger was
made in late 1983 after officials decided to move some of
the University’s historical records from their storage
place in Washington Hall to the climate-controlled stor-
age facilities of the University Library.

Included among those records was a manuscript
known to be associated with Washington, whose connec-
tion with W&L dates back to 1796, when his gift of canal
stock to the struggling institution, then known as Liberty
Hall Academy, saved the school from financial ruin.

“The document was yellowed by age, stained with
water spots and covered with mold colonies that looked
like Rorschach blots,” said Oram.

The signature of one of W&L’s first benefactors,
George Washington, can be seen on this page of a ledger
belonging to the University Library.

Even in that condition though, the document’s leaves
bear the unmistakable signature of ‘‘Geo Washington,”’
Oram said.

Once the book had been uncovered, Oram began his
search to find out precisely what significance it might
have. With the assistance of independent Lexington
scholar Joseph Horrell, Oram began his investigation by
first matching mold stains on the leaves in an eflort to
put the pages back into their proper order.

‘‘Joe Horrell spent several hours a day for almost a
year analyzing the manuscript,’ said Oram. ‘‘We now
know that Washington set up this ledger to preserve

copies of all the reports he submitted to the General
Court at Williamsburg during the 12 years he adminis-
tered Daniel Parke Custis’ estate.”

What makes the discovery even more valuable is that
records of the General Court were all lost in a fire in
1865.

According to Oram, Washington biographer Douglas
Southall Freeman, used records that duplicated some of
the material in the newly discovered ledger in order to
describe the settlement of the estate.

Freeman, however, knew less about Washington’s
guardianship of John Parke (Jacky) and Martha Parke
(Patsy) Custis. Apparently Freeman did consult the
W&L ledger, but it was so scrambled at that time that he
could not identify the guardianship accounts it contain-
ed.

“These provide much new information about the rear-
ing of Washington’s stepchildren and the preservation of
their inheritance,”’ said Oram.

Washington married the widow Martha Custis in Janu-
ary 1759 and succeeded her as the administrator of her
late husband's estate. Using the ledger entries, Horrell
has estimated that the estate was worth 29,650 pounds in
the currency of Colonial Virginia. Though confessing
that some scholars may dispute his estimate, Horrell
contends that would translate into about $6 million in to-
day’s money.

Once uncovered, the ledger proved immediately use-
ful to University of Virginia scholars who are compiling
all of Washington’s papers in a multi-volume edition.

U.Va.’s W.W. Abbot, editor of The Papers of George
Washington said that after the manuscript’s restoration
“‘we will have the most important addition to George
Washington’s material in more than a generation.”

“The Custis property was the basis for Washington's
own future, and his management of that property was
his main concern from the time of his marriage until the
Revolution,’’ he continued. “Certainly the account book
will add greatly to our volumes dealing with this per-
iod.”’

As Oram has reconstructed the events, here is how the
ledger found its way to W&L:

After Washington died in 1799, his papers were dis-

persed. Many were passed down to George Washington
Parke Custis and, in turn, to his daughter Mary, who
was later to become Mrs. Robert E. Lee.

When Union troops advanced on Arlington in 1861,
Mrs. Lee shipped trunks of family silver and papers to
Richmond and on to Lexington, where they were buried.
The material included the ledger.

Mrs. Lee once described Lexington as ‘‘the most inac-
cessible place I know of.”

In 1865, Gen. Robert E. Lee became president of what
was then Washington College. When General and Mrs.
Lee moved to Lexington, the buried silver and papers
were dug up and were found to be covered with mold be-
cause the box had leaked.

In the 1890s George Washington Custis Lee, who
succeeded his father as president of W&L, gave the
Washington and Custis papers to the Virginia Historical
Society. In 1907, though, his sister, Mary Custis Lee,
withdrew some of the papers and gave the account book
to Washington and Lee. It remained in Washington Hall
from then until it was moved to the University Library in
1983.

Oram said the ledger will be taken to Philadelphia this
summer to be restored. The restoration project is being
supported by a gift from Mr. and Mrs. John G. Hamilton
of Florida and from library funds contributed in memo-
ry of late W&L professor Ollinger Crenshaw, author of
‘General Lee’s College.”

The Washington ledger will join several other impor-
tant Washington relics in the University’s collection. A
celebrated portrait of Washington by artist Charles Will-
son Peale and portraits of the Custis family hang in Lee
Chapel. The Reeves Center owns a dinner plate from
Washington’s set of china.

“The library’s collection of Washington material was,
until now, relatively insignificant compared to our
collection of Robert E. Lee material,’’ said Oram. ‘‘This
ledger will help rectify that and will also give us a better
understanding of Washington as an exceptionally syste-
matic man who was particularly meticulous in his re-
cord-keeping.”’

And rather prudent in his choice of a spouse.

 

 

 

Exall resigns Cold Check post

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Junior Henry Exall resigned as
chairman of the Student Financial
Relations Committee Monday night,
stating in a letter to the Executive
Committee that he was forced to re-
sign due to “circumstances beyond
{his ] control.”’

The EC unanimously selected
sophomore Peter Bennorth as the
new chairman of the SFRC, or ‘‘Cold
Check” committee.

‘‘We grieve the loss of Henry,”’ EC
President Cole Dawson said.

Exall had been scheduled to ap-
pear at the meeting to defend himself
against charges that his _perfor-
mance as the committee head had
been inadequate.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers nominated Bennorth as

 
 
    
 
 
  

the new chairman saying that ‘‘he’s
the man for the job.”

Bennorth has been a member of the
cold check committee this year and
said he has worked closely with trea-
urer Jim Murphy.

Bennorth said he believes Exall re-
signed because ‘the has been per-
ceived as being the focal point of the
problem.”’

“TI guess the bounced check was the
final straw.”’ he said, referring to an
incident last month.

According to Bennorth, this year's
committee started out with a great
deal of bounced checks from last
year’s seniors that needed to be co-
vered. Consequently, the committee
was left ‘‘in the hole.”’ He said it has
been trying to catch up ever since.

On the other hand, Bennorth ac-
knowledged that Exall should have
been more aware and could have im-

proved his communication with the
town merchants.

“T want to stress that I feel Henry
did a credible job and was the victim
of circumstance,’’ Bennorth said.

He said he hopes to bolster the cold
check committee’s standing with
town merchants through various im-
provements in the committee’s man-
agement.

For instance, he intends on posting
hours when he and Murphy will be in
the office. He explained that then
members can know when they can
get a check issued. In addition, he
said he plans to check the mailbox
every day.

“We have meetings every Thurs-
day night and Carole [Chappell]
would put notes in the mailbox on
Friday,’ Bennorth said. ‘‘Then it
would take a week before we even got
the note. I hope this way we can
speed up the process.”’

“there’s no point in stacking [the
case],’’ Read said. ‘‘There’s no joy in
a case like this. It’s a tragic situa-
tion.”

Summarizing the Commonwealth’s
evidence for Honts, Read said that a
teller at United Virginia Bank would
testify that she could positively
identify Vaughan as the man who
passed the $1,800 check. The teller,
Read said, had identified Vaughan
from photographs taken in the bank,
a police photo line-up and his picture
in the 1984 Calyx.

A handwriting analysis comparing
the $1,800 check and a letter written
by Vaughan showed “‘strong similari-
ties,’ according to a handwriting ex-
pert, Read said. This evidence was
not present in court, Read said, but

From Staff Reports

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
was rehired for an indefinite period
by a 5-1 vote of city council Thursday
night. Sutton, who has been in police
work for 35 years, begins his third
year here May 9.

Councilman Albert C. Jordan was
the dissenting vote. He said that in an
informal poll of 56 citizens, 32 said
Sutton should not be rehired, 16 said
he should be and eight were uncer-
tain.

Jordan said that although he is
“‘not a professional pollster,” he felt
that ‘‘for something as important as
hiring a chief of police, people should
have a Say in the hiring.”

Councilwoman Susan A. LaRue,
trade book manager of the Washing-
ton and Lee Bookstore, said she felt
Sutton should continue on his job
because ‘‘we are on a good course
now.”

“Tl respect very much the opinions
that were expressed on both sides,”’
she said. ‘‘I think that we now have a
more professional police department
that has offered, according to speci-
fic examples, excellent help to citi-
zens in their problems for the last two
years.”

An April 11 press report quoted two

samples would be included in the
case file. The photographs were ar-
ranged in an extensive exhibit Read
had prepared for the jury.

A positive identification of
Vaughan could not be made by the
teller who cashed the $500 check,
Read said, although he added that
she would testify that Vaughan and
the man who cashed tire check looked
“‘very similar.”’

Read said that this $500 check had
been examined by a fingerprint ex-
pert, who had found Vaughan’s fin-
gerprints on the check.

Among the 19 people who had been
subpoenaed to testify yesterday were
Abbe, physics Professor James J.
Donaghy, Physical Education Pro-
fessor Norman F. Lord, Proctor
Charles F. ‘‘Murph” Murray, assis-
tant history Professor John D. Par-
ker and Anne S. Ziegler, secretary to
the dean of the Commerce School.

In his pre-sentencing report, Read
recommended that because this was

unnamed police officers as saying
they were dissatisfied with Sutton’s
personnel policies.

Sutton, 55, said later that day that
he doesn’t ‘expect everyone to al-
ways agree with me or the things that
Ido.”

“I deal with events, not personali-
ties,’’ he said. ‘“‘Some events are eas-
ier to handle than others....There are
always differences of opinion at one
time or another on one subject or
another.”

Since Sutton became chief on May
9, 1983, eight or nine officers have left
the 14-member force, he said. Two
were fired and the others left volun-
tarily, according to Sutton.

Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds said that “if the [city]
council and the city manager are
happy with him, I have no gripe with
itatall.”

Sutton arrived in Lexington in the
wake of the trial of several members
of the department for their alleged
involvement in a theft ring. “At the
time I came here, [the department]
was emerging from a bad period, and
I believe it has progressed quite well
since that time,”’ he said.

Sutton said he has ‘“‘absolutely not”’
been involved in local political ac-
tivities. “I’m not a politician, and

Apartheid violates international law,

.

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

South Africa’s apartheid policies
are “a matter of legitimate interna-
tional concern” and ‘‘a violation of
international law,’’ Law School Dean
Frederic L. Kirgis Jr. said Tuesday.

Despite these apparent violations
of international law, though, Kirgis
Said, the international community
has difficulties enforcing that law.

“T think it’s clear that South Africa
is violating customary and treaty in-
ternational law,” he added, ‘‘but the
international response is just plain li-
mited.”’

Kirgis’ lecture, sponsored by the
International Law Association and
the Washington and Lee Campaign
Against Apartheid, attracted about
70 people to a Law School classroom.

The Campagin Against Apartheid
wraps up six weeks of formal activi-
ties tonight with a showing of ABC
News’ ‘Nightline’ videotapes in
Northen Auditorium and the Student
Center.

The campaign was intended to in-
form the W&L community about
South Africa and to encourage the
trustees to examine the investments
in the University’s portfolio to see if
the school invests in companies that
do busines in South Africa, said Law
Professor William S. Geimer, a foun-
der of the campaign.

Copies of a resolution calling on the
trustees to study the portfolio
have been circulated at the Law
School and on the undergraduate
campus. Geimer said he would not
know until after tonight how many
people had signed the resolution;

‘Famine’

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

 

A “planned famine’”’ in which par-
ticipating students will fast from 8
p.m. tomorrow until noon Sunday
will be the highlight of Lexington’s
World Hunger Awareness Week.

Next week has received that offi-
cial designation from Mayor Charles
F. Phillips. The purpose of the 40-
hour fast is to raise funds for World
Vision, a non-denominational anti-
hunger group with a Christian focus.

The event is being co-sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Intervarsity
Christian Fellowship and Virginia
Military Institute’s Religious Life
Council. Money will be collected
from sponsors, who aid the national
drive by pledging an amount for each

however, about 30 members of the
Law School faculty have signed his,
and 40 to 50 law students signed
another copy last week.

Geimer added that at the request of
a letter written by three alumni, the
trustees discussed the issue once be-
fore within the past two years.

Introducing Kirgis, Geimer said
Kirgis would be speaking to provide
information about South Africa ‘‘and
not as a supporter of the resolution,
necessarily.”’

International law is derived from
two main sources — treaties and cus-
toms — Kirgis said. A country that
decides to adopt a treaty or to opt out
of a custom legally isn’t bound by it,
he added.

South Africa is bound, though, by
the United Nations Charter, Kirgis
said. Although South Africa’s repre-
sentative to the U.N. has not been
accredited for nearly 10 years, the
country still is a member.

At least one provision of the U.N.
Charter calls for the elimination of
racial discrimination, Kirgis said,
but South Africa has defended apar-
theid by relying on another provision,
which prevents UN intervention in
matters that are essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of any coun-
try

“‘T think that South Africa’s claim
is fallacious,” Kirgis added.

Although South Africa is not party
to a number of other treaties that call
for the elimination of racial discrimi-
nation, ‘“‘They nevertheless are signi-
ficant to South Africa for a number of
reasons,’ Kirgis said.

“They quite clearly establish that a
governmental policy of enforced rac-
ial discrimination against one’s own

citizens is not a matter within the
state’s own jurisdiction. It is a mat-
ter of legitimate international con-
cern.”

These treaties fill in some of the
generalities of the U.N. Charter, Kir-
gis said. In addition, in an advisory
opinion, the International Court of
Justice called apartheid ‘‘a flagrant
violation of the purposes and princi-
ples of the U.N. Charter,” he added.

“There is a strong trend and a con-
sistent trend of opinion from a wide
range of countries that the systema-
tic conduct of racial discrimination is
a violation of international law,” Kir-
gis said.

In addition, Kirgis said, racial dis-
crimination can be classified as a
pre-emptory norm, which ‘“‘have to
do with things that virtually every-
body could agree on, principally on
moral grounds.”

“Once a norm is established at that
level,” he added, ‘‘you’re bound by it
whether you like it or not and no mat-
ter how much you squawk about it.”’

Beginning to discuss the enforce-
ment capabilities of the international
system, Kirgis said, ‘‘here’s where
things get discouraging.”

In the late 1970s, a U.N. Security
Council resolution placed a manda-
tory embargo on the shipment of
arms to South Africa. This action has
had a mixed effect, Kirgis said, be-
cause South Africa has been able to
manufacture weapons for itself and
purchase others on the so-called
black market.

The Security Council’s broadening
these sanctions is ‘‘within the realm
of possibility and could happen very
soon,”’ said Kirgis, who added that he

does not expect military action to be
taken against South Africa.

Possible actions by the United
States include placing certain trade
embargoes on South Africa and
breaking off diplomatic relations
with the South African government,
Kirgis said.

Under international law, though,
the U.S. could not provide military
support to revolutionary groups, he
added, as a titter went through the
audience, thinking of the current de-

bate about U.S. aid to the rebels in
Nicaragua. (The House of Represen-
tatives was rejecting President Rea-
gan’s proposal even as Kirgis spoke).

‘‘Now you could argue that we vio-
late that prohibition in other places,”
Kirgis said.

Even the force of public opinion
does not seem to have worked
against South Africa, he said, and
‘the result is a little frustrating. I’m
not sure what can be done effective-

to kick off Hunger Awareness Week

hour fasted.

Clarke Morledge, president of the
IVCF, said the effort is meant to
bring the issue of hunger closer to the
community. ‘Unfortunately, most
people don’t respond to hunger until
they see it on their TV sets,”’ he said.

The fast will begin, Morledge said,
with a candlelight service at the Ro-
bert E. Lee Episcopal Church at 8
p.m. tomorrow. Several local clergy-
men will speak, including Chaplain
Charles C. Caudill of VMI, who origi-
nally organized the event. A ‘‘break
fast’”’ celebration at the VMI dining
hall will close the activities at mid-
day Sunday.

World Vision claims that 79 cents of
each dollar donated to the group goes
directly to aid the poor, according to
Morledge.

Morledge said that the groups

made the famine effort last year as
well, with W&L raising more money
than any other Virginia campus.

Morledge said that besides raising
money for World Vision, the fast has
three purposes: to raise community
awareness about the problem of
world hunger and what can be done
about it; to bring together several
hundred members of the community,
breaking down barriers between
groups; and to obey the New Testa-
ment commandment to have com-
passion for the poor.

This last reason is the most impor-
tant one to the members of the two
college religious organizations,
Morledge said. ‘‘If you don’t have a
good focus as to why you are doing
something, the effort becomes guilt-
ridden,” he explained. ‘‘People give

IU FD party called ‘total disaster’

 

By ROB DORAIS
Staff Reporter

 

Suffering from a_ self-described
“credibility problem,’’ the Indepen-
dent Union has run into some difficul-
ties this year in planning parties and
organizing intramural teams for in-
dependents.

The latest problem occurred the
Saturday of Fancy Dress weekend,
when an [U-sponsored party in the
‘Cockpit reportedly attracted fewer
than 50 people and was described as
“a total disaster’’ by Jerry Darrell,
food services director.

In an April 1 letter to the Executive
Committee, Darrell said that at 10
p.m. attendance at the Cockpit was
about 30 people, about 10 of whom
were friends of the band.

Total Cockpit food and beverage
sales for the evening were $87.56.

“Unless drastic changes are made
for 1986 I submit that opening the
Cockpit on Saturday night is a waste
of time and student body funds,’’ he
added in the letter.

IU acting President Luke Cornelius
said the group has had to contend
with the shaky start it received last
year, when it was under the direction

' of Jim Sarle and Joe Cadle, neither of
whom is involved in this year’s or-

ganization. The EC also denied the
IU’s request for funds last winter.
This year, under the leadership of

’ President Chuck Diffenderffer, the
, TU was given $257 in the fall from stu-

dent body funds, and about a dozen
members each paid $15 social dues.
An IU-sponsored Christmas party in
the Cockpit attracted about 300 peo-
ple and was called ‘‘an unmitigated

» success’’ by Cornelius.

Cornelius said that a ‘‘liberal esti-
mate” of the number of the people at
the Cockpit for the Fancy Dress par-
ty would be 100.

The Student Activities Board co-
sponsored the event and paid $800 for
the band, Ten-Ten.

Darrell, who said the Cockpit lost
several hundred dollars by holding
the IU Fancy Dress party last year,
added that he thinks the problem re-
sults from lack of continuity. The of-
ficers change each year, and there is
disunity within the organization, he
said.

Cornelius agreed, but said the pro-
blem will not exist next year, when
all of the officers, except himself,
will be returning.

Another reason cited by Cornelius
for the poor attendance at some IU
activities was a lack of advertising
and poor organization.

Although the IU is perceived as

having about 600 students to field
teams and plan parties, Cornelius
said, the actual IU consists of about
60 people who have attended parties,
participated in intramurals or used
the cold test file in the IU’s office.

That cold test file has grown this
year, according to Cornelius, al-
though the officers found it difficult
to keep the office open so that stu-
dents could use it. Every independent
can’t have a key to the office, he said,
and there are not enough things to do
in the office to warrant keeping it
open. ;
The IU will hold one more meeting
this term, Cornelius said. In addition,
anyone wishing to sign up for intra-
mural track events must do so by 4
p.m. tomorrow.

terested in joining the fast are avail-
able at the University Center office

In addition to the Planned Famine,
the IVCF organized a fund raiser for
an unspecified local charitable
group, possibly the Rockbridge Area
Relief Fund, through Evans Dining
Hall. On Tuesday, students volun-
teered to give up their dinner, with
the cost of the food to be donated to
the cause of local hunger. Identical
efforts in the past three years have
usually raised between $300 and $400,
Morledge said.

Morledge said he hopes Hunger
Awareness Week will dispel some
myths about hunger, for example,
that hunger is due to overpopulation.

“Hunger is due to poverty,’’ he
said, ‘‘which may or may not be link-
ed to overpopulation. Sometimes
overpopulation is an attempt to deal
with local poverty. For some families
in the world, more children mean
more field workers and hence more
food produced.”

The week’s events may also gener-
ate some greater achievements. ‘‘In-
dividually, we all say, ‘What can I
do?’ ” Morledge said. ‘‘But working
in groups, a lot can be accomplished.
You can influence the Congress and
national policy even. We hope to
create an arena for various hunger
groups this week, and hopefully some
further actions can be made.”’

$50,000 gift
for Mock Con

Washington and Lee has received a
$50,000 grant from the Hatton W.
Sumners Foundation to enlarge an
endowment fund created to support
W&L’s mock political conventions.

The Hatton W. Sumners Mock Poli-
tical Convention Endowment was
created in September 1981 with a
grant to W&L of $100,000.

The Dallas-based foundation be-
came interested in the Mock Conven-
tion through Judge Charles E. Long
Jr. of Dallas, a 1932 graduate of
W&L. The endowment grants ex-
press the interest of the Sumners
Foundation in the “‘study and teach-
ing of the science of self-govern-
ment”’ in the United States.

W&L has held its Mock Convention
since 1908 and has established an un-
paralleled record for accuracy. Fore-
casting the nominee of the party out
of the White House more than two
months before the ‘‘real’’ conven-
tions, W&L Mock Conventions have
been correct 13 times in 18 attempts.

The last Mock Convention was held
in May 1984 and correctly predicted
that Walter Mondale would be the no-
minee of the Democratic Party.

Phi staffers
win awards

The Ring-tum Phi this year was
ranked first place with special merit
in the annual newspaper evaluation
contest of the American Scholastic
Press Association.

Judges for the New York-based
ASPA, which has more than 1,300
member newspapers, said The Phi
“demonstrates a high degree of
professionalism in its writing, design
and photography.”

In this region’s Mark of Excellence
contest sponsored by the Society of
Professional Journalists, Sigma Del-
ta Chi, Chief Editor Bruce Potter
received second place awards for
spot news reporting and editorial
writing and sophomore Chris Bow-
ring placed third in editorial cartoon-
ing.

The news award was for Potter’s
coverage this summer of the ea,ic
sion of an overturned gasoline truck.
He wrote the story for The Richmond
News Leader, where he will work be-
ginning in June. The editorial award
was for a selection of his editorials
from The Phi.

The cartooning award was for a
portfolio of Bowring’s work. Bow-
ring, 34, is an accomplished painter
who has had numerous art shows in
this area. Several of his works were
featured in the recent student show
at the du Pont Gallery.

Aldridge described this year’s
competition as the ‘‘most balanced”’
field in several years. In addition to
the Generals, Aldridge cited Lynch-
burg, Bridgewater and Emory and

title

Bridgewater is led by Isaac Rod-
gers, a sprinter and jumper who par-
ticipated in this year’s NCAA Divi-
sion III indoor nationals, and Mark
Luiggi, a strong middle distance run-
ner. Emory & Henry’s Keith Arring-

in the nation, has already qualified
for the outdoor nationals in the pole
vault. Lynchburg’s Joe Killeen is a
top contender in the 400 meter hur-

ber of the 400-meter relay team. Mc

Several Generals will double or

three events to add to the team depth

White, in fact, will compete in six
events on Saturday: two relays (in-
cluding the 400-meter relay team
with Ives, McGowan and Chris Bleg-
gi which set a school record last
weekend at Furman), the 200 meters,
the 400 meters, the triple jump and

The senior members of the W&L
track team head inc this weekend’s
meet with impressive statistics. Dur-
ing their four years, they have com-
piled a 25-3 dual meet record, won
three ODAC championships (two in-
door and one outdoor), and have
contributed to the current streak of
13 consecutive dul meet victories.

Coach Aldridge attributes much of
this success to his two assistant
coaches, Joe Freeland and Steve
Jefferson.

But all the statistics aside, one can-
not doubt that the Generals are ready
for Saturday. One need only the
verve of senior Ken Moles: ‘‘Every-
body is psyched for this!”’

The meet will begin at 10 a.m.
Saturday and continue throughout

The Generals lost two contests dur
ing the spring vacation. Last Wed
nesday, Cornell's Big Red beat W&L,
14-6. Saturday, the Generals took the
nation’s No. 1-ranked Division III la-
crosse team, Washington College, to
a pair of overtime periods before los-
ing 14-13.

It is the latter affair that pleased
Daly the most.

“That was a unique sports exper-
ience,” he recalled. ‘“‘That’s how
lacrosse should be played. Two
teams went at each other for 60 min-
utes, found they were tied, and went
at each other again for almost eight
minutes more.”

Went at each other, indeed. The
lead see-sawed throughout regula-
tion with neither team ever gaining a

lead of more than a goal.

The Sho’men appeared to have the
game secured with four minutes to
play after taking a 13-12 lead and con-
trolling the ball.

sion-making process. What Tulane’s
decision means (that is, if others
are willing to pay attention to it) is simply that big-time college
athletics has lost touch with any possible connection it ever had with
those old-fashioned ideals of complementing a student's academic life
and strengthening a young man or woman’s character.

Yes, lost touch, and it is very disconcerting. U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, a
former standout hoopster himself, said on ABC’s ‘‘Sportsbeat”’ that he
was ‘“‘sad”’ about the Tulane decision, that athletics enhanced his
undergraduate development as well as lending unity and providing en-
joyment for the rest of the student body.

Well, yes, it makes me said, too, senator, but the fact of the matter
is, the folks at Tulane only were revealing what I think is inherent in
the makeup of the present-day world of college athletics.

Intercollegeiate athletics on this level no longer can be called ex-
tracurricular activities. For an overwhelming number of the trained
automatons running and jumping around in college sports, basketball
and football are the curricula. What the decision at Tulane reflects is
the idea that one university is not going to fall prey to this sickening
trend of win, win, win, along with its partner in crime, money, money,
money.

The decision at Tulane was the only one to be made if you see a
university as a place of learning. More importantly, though, the deci-
sion touched on something that it seems far too few other schools are
willing 1) to admit and 2) act on.

It’s a simple adage, but quite pertinent in this case: The bigger and
more complex something gets, the more problems it is going to have.
Division I (and conceivably all of college athletics) has reached a
point at which it is no longer safe from corroding away at its insides
Winning and success now have become the only acceptable results,
andwith this pressure the likelihood for repeats of the Tulane scandal,
where cheating is viewed solely as a means to an end, rather than as
something that on its face might be construed as wrong, becomes quite
great.

Tulane made no plans to reinstate the program after some time, and
that too should be applauded. What they realized is that to start the
program again is to invite the same problems all over again.

In the end, then, what can we take from the Tulane decision? A hope
that all intercollegiate athletics are abolished? Well, maybe so. We
are at a stage where even the Little League probably is filled with
glory-hungry parents cheating so their little boys always win, In any
case, cheating and just plain old dirt in sports is becoming more and
more the rule rather than the exception, and like the skater on thin ice,
a change in skates isn’t going to do much good. What is going to help is
a resolve that a college is a place of learning and study and that it can-
not be such if we continue to allow 1) educationally deficient athletes
to take up the desks of real students, and 2) an attitude that mandates
immediate success at the price not only of individuals but ultimately
of universities as well...

Baseball skidding as ODACs near

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee baseball
team fell to 4-15 yesterday after los-
ae at home to Virginia Wesleyan,

4.

The game was not as close as the
score indicates as W&L, scored all
four of its runs in the bottom of the
ninth inning after the outcome had
been determined.

Wesleyan, nationally ranked in
Division III, scored once in the first
inning and again in the third thanks
to a W&L error and a walk given up
by pitcher Carter Steuart. The Gen-

. erals fell behind 3-0 in the fifth and

surrendered two more runs in the six
tth to trail 5-0. Wesleyan put the
game out of reach in the eighth by
scoring three more runs to open a
commanding 8-0 lead before the W&L
rally in the last frame.

Bill Schoettelkotte got the Generals
in the scoring column with his one-
out home run to left field. Pinch hit-
ter Don Thayer reached on an error
and was followed by a walk to pinch
hitter Tom Mack and singles by
pinch hitter Carmen Clement and
regulars Chip Hutchins and Hugh
Finkelstein. Thayer, Mack and Cle-
ment all scored for W&L.

“We gave up quite a few runs that
we shouldn’t have,” Murdock said.
“We continue to make mistakes at
the plate that we shobut not swinging
at any pitch.”’

In conference action last week,
W&L dropped three of its four ODAC
contests, losing to Lynchburg and
Bridgewater before splitting a dou-
bleheader with Maryville.

Against Lynchburg, the seventh-
ranked team in the country in Divi-
sion III, the Generals gave up a cost-
ly unearned run in the fourth inning
to allow the Hornets to win 4-3 in a
game that was halted after five inn-
ings because of rain.

Schoettelkotte got the loss for the
Generals despite turning in a solid
performance. The sophomore allow-
ed only five hits and three earned
against Lynchburg while fanning
eight.

W&L fell behind early in the game
against Bridgewater and never re-
covered, losing 7-1 at Smith Field to
the Eagles.

The Generals snapped their four-
game losing in the first game of the
doubleheader at Maryville, winning
3-2. White bounced back from the
Bridgewater loss to get the win,
yielding only four hits and two runs
(one earned) in going the distance.

In the second game, it was the Gen-
erals who were shut down as W&L
could produce no runs and only five
hits in losing 3-0. Bridgewater scored
single runs in the first, second and
fourth innings for the win.

Schoettelkotte once again pitched
well but received little help from his
teammates. Schoettelkotte hurled a
five-hitter and allowed only one earn-
ed run in his complete game perfor-

~ game, Daly said “‘the feeling of

everybody on the field was that we
would score.”
Score they did. After a missed shot,

the Generals’ Jeff Mason forced the

extra periods with his second goal of
the day.
“That play was indicative of the

2 way we have been playing,’ Daly

said. ‘‘These guys never give up. We
were down by a goal, forced a turn-
over and made the most of our oppor-
tunity. That shows a lot of fortitude
and guts.”

Washington got the winning tally at
the close of the second overtime per-
iod. Rick Sowell scored his fifth goal
of the game on a pass from Bruce
Yancey with 10 seconds remaining in
the period.

Starring for the Generals in the de-
feat, which ensured a third straight
losing season for W&L, were attack-
men Rod Santomassimo (4 goals, 2
assists), Mark Knobloch (3 goals, 1
assist) and Caulley Deringer, who re-
turned to his hometown of Chester-
town, Md., to record a goal and three
assists. Keeping up his torrid pace in
goal, John DiDuro stopped 18 shots
against the Sho’men, the same num-
ber of saves he had against Cornell.

Daly said the Washington game
left his team and him with a special
feeling. ‘‘Right afterwards, the feel-
ing was, ‘That’s why you play.’ ”’ I
think there was a lot of respect earn-

ed for each team.”

“Our kids felt it was the best game
they’ve played all year. I think that
performance has buoyed the team,”’
Daly said.

Next up for the Generals is an
away contest — their fourth in a row
— with Bucknell (7-3). The Bison lost
22-7 Tuesday to the sixth-ranked
team in Division I, the Jack Emmer-
coached U.S. Military Academy. The
only common opponent between
W&L and Bucknell is Towson State, a
team that beat the Generals but lost
to the Bison.

Daly said the Generals are in as
good a mental state as they have
been in all season. ‘“‘Right now, the
feeling is that we did play well
{against Washington], and, yeah, |
guess we are further along than we
have been.”

“Our mental state is better than it
has been and better than anyone at

Breen suspended

The Generals will be without the
services of pitcher Kirk Breen for
the remainder of the season. Head
coach Jim Murdock said Breen,
who was part of the starting rota-
tion, has not contacted him since
he was suspended from the team
before spring vacation after the
two had a verbal exchange during
the Generals’ game with Hamp-
den-Sydney.

“Kirk was suspended the week
of break and had the chance to
come back after break,”’ Murdock
said. ‘‘I guess he just didn’t want
to come back.’

“T guess you could say that we
had a difference of opinion about
pitching,’ Murdock said. “I don’t
profess to be the greatest coach in
the world, but I will stay within
my system. I will not allow a play-
er to dictate his opinion to his
teammates or me.”’

Breen could not be reached for

Tennis beats Emory;
nationals a possibility

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

In their biggest match of the
season, the Washington and Lee ten-
nis Generals defeated Emory Uni-
versity, 7-2, a victory that may prove
instrumental in the Generals’ efforts
to earn a bid to the national cham-
pionships.

Head coach Gary Franke and the
team have understood all year long
the supreme importance of yester-
day’s match. Franke emphasized
before the match that the Generals
not only needed to win, but to win big.

‘We really need to blitz Emory,”
he said.

The team met the pressure head
on, losing only at No. 1 singles, where
David McLeod dropped a 6-4, 6-4 de-
cision to the highly ranked Keith Git-
telson, and at No. 5 singles, where
freshman Chris Wiman lost in a third
set tie breaker.

Because many of the contending
teams for bids to nationals have not
competed against one another during
the year, the selection process is a
complex and confusing affair that in-
volves such methods as comparing
how two teams fared against similar
opponents or how close a particular
match was.

Of importance to W&L’s chances
for a bid is an earlier season match
between Emory and now top-ten
ranked Millsaps College that Mill-
saps won by a 6-3 score. W&L’s better
victory over Emory, although not
guaranteeing a bid, should be a key
factor in the selection committee’s
deliberations. In other action, the
Generals completed their four-match

their entry fee will receive a T-
shirt, which have been provided
by an anonymous donor who want-
ed to recognize George Cunning-
ham’s achievements in a special
way.

In the 5K and 10K races, awards
will be given to first-, second-, and
third-place finishers in each of 12
age divisions for men and women.
A gift certificate for an ice cream
cone from Sweet Things will be
the prize for the Fun Run.

A donation from Huger Distri-
buting Co. of Lexington will de-
fray most of the expenses of the
Cancer Runs.

Arby’s will provide liquid re-
freshments for the runners. Fol-
lowing the race there will be sev-
eral drawings for prizes donated
by Jefferson Florist, the Body

trip through Florida last week, and
though they lost three of the four con-
tests, the trip was a very positive
experience for the team, Franke
said.

Though the trip down to the Sun-
shine State was a mite crowded with
10 people in the the team van, the
Generals got the Southern swing off
to a good start with a 7-2 victory over
Division I Stetson University.

“We felt before that we could play
with Stetson,” Franke said. ‘‘I
thought we played fairly well.”

W&L’s lone victory came from Jim
Morgan, who was again in for the
injured Adams. Morgan won in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.

The Generals’ final match of the
trip was a frustrating 5-4 loss to the
No. 2-ranked team in the National As-
sociation of Intercollegiate Athletics,
Flagler College. The Generals drop-
ped four of the six singles contests
but were able to tie the match at 4-4
with wins at No. 1 and No. 3 doubles.
Flagler claimed the victory, how-
ever, with a three-set win at NO. 2
doubles, defeating the team of Roby
Mize and Adams, 7-5, 5-7, 6-2.

On Monday, the Generals suffered
a shutout defeat at the hands of Divi-
sion I James Madison. It was the first
time this season that the Generals
had been shut out.

W&L takes its 13-8 mark to Lynch-
burg this weekend for the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference champion-
ships. The Generals have not lost to
an ODAC opponent this season and
enter the event as the heavy favo-
rites, with an outside chance of
sweeping all six singles flights and
the three doubles flights.

Rescue squads from Lexington

According to Patti Ryan-Man-
del, the race director, the course
for the 10K race will be the same
aS a year ago, using the Chessie
Trail course and finishing along
the Woods Creek Trail. The 5K
course has been redesigned to eli-
minate the hilly second half that
troubled some runners last year.
The new section, which comprises
two-thirds of the run, lies mainly
on level ground along the Woods

VMI and Washington and Lee.

‘Around the World’ with Prince

ALBUMREVIEW

By MARSHALL BOSWELL

 

 

You might have already heard that
the new Prince album is out and that
it is supposed to be a psychedelic de-
parture from last year’s Purple Rain.
Everyone from Newsweek to The
Washington Post has featured the
new record and it has caused quite a
Stir.

Granted, the new album, called
Around the World in a Day, certainly
looks psychedelic and much of it even
sounds like it might have been releas-
ed in 1967; however, if the truth were
known, it isn’t quite the musical
curve ball that the media has been
promising.

Actually, Around the World is
basically the logical extension of Pur-
ple Rain. For instance, all of that talk
of a ‘“‘purple rain’’ sounded suspici-
ously similar to a ‘‘purple haze,’
while the Purple Rain sleeve was
adorned with flowers. Prince’s quitar
work even recalled a certain Jimi
Hendryx. So did his haircut.

So, the new LP just picks up these
influences and runs with them. The
difference here is that Prince is
shooting for the Beatles this time out.

Now, too much can be read into this
Beatles comparison, but I don’t think
the similarities are an accident. The
disc opens up with the Eastern influ-
enced title track, and it is an obvious
throwback to George Harrison’s sitar

experiments/mistakes. Cello, oud,
finger cymbals and a darbuka clang
and whine while the lyrics promise to
“escort U 2 places in your mind.”
Sounds like some kind of magical
mystery tour to me.

The following number, ‘‘Paisley
Park,’’ bears more than a passing re-
semblance to “Strawberry Fields
Forever.’’ His pace is slow and
moody anda violin runs throughout.

After that, though, the rest of the
record continues in pretty standard
Prince fashion. ‘‘Rasberry Beret”’ is
driven by a tasteful string section
and it recalls last year’s ‘‘Take Me
With U.”

“Condition of the Heart”’ is simply
another Prince ballad, although it
outruns anything else he’s done by a
mile.

Primarily, the biggest departure is
in the record’s subject matter. The
lewd, lascivious sexual come-ons are
not nearly as pronounced, and when
they are brought out, His Royal Bad-
ness rebukes his own immorality.

The most prominent example of
this element is the record’s center-
piece, the 8'2 minute ‘‘Temptation.”
The track closes the album and it is
more or less this year’s answer to
“Purple Rain.’’ The pace is bluesy
and Prince pretty much jacks his
Fender Telecaster to 10 and lets rip.

It begins predictably enough:
Prince squeals and screams about
his uncontrollable sexual passion,
wailing, ‘‘Temptation/working my

 

?

 

 

 

The album cover of Prince's ‘A4round the World ina Day.’

body with a hot flash of animal
lust...’ There is talk of something
called ‘‘Purplelectricity’’ and the
tune builds to a standard Prince gui-
tar rave-up

All at once, though, the bottom
drops out and nothing but a piano and
a wandering saxophone remain.
Then comes Prince's rap with God.

That’s right. His rap with God.

The Almighty informs His Purple
Holiness that ‘‘you’ve got 2 want it 4
the right reasons. U don’t. Now die.”
So Prince wises up, apologizes and
promises to be good from now on.
Then he signs off. End of record.

Pretty cryptic, indeed, but it does
raise a problem. All of this psychede-
lic imagery and the talk of mind jour-
neys comes off as entirely too mani-
pulative. When the Beatles and Bob
Dylan flew into the mystic, it reflect-

ed the spirit of the times. I am hard-
pressed to believe that there is any
chance of a new Summer of Love in
these MTV, pro wrestling, Apple-
computerized eighties.

That aside, Around The World In A
Day is quite entertaining, challenging
and romantic. I could do without the
overly jingoistic ‘‘America,”’ but the
gospel-tinged ‘‘The Ladder”’ is a bril-
liant spritual anthem. And if there is
a message for these Yuppie-infested
eighties, then the funky ‘‘Pop Life”’ is
it. “Is the mailman jerking U
around?” Prince taunts. ‘‘Did he put
your million dollar check in someone
else’s box?”’ Indeed.

In closing, you can dance to it, it’s
got a good beat and I give it a 90. End
of review.

This ‘Vacation’ not worth the taking

MOVIEREVIEW

By COTTON PURYEAR

 

 

“Fraternity Vacation.”

The words bring to mind hordes of
young college males piling into cars,
driving to one of America’s many
wonderful beaches, drinking lots of
beers and generally abusing the fe-
male populance of said wonderful
beach. What ‘Fraternity Vacation’”
gives us is five frat boys in Palm
Springs drinking only a few beers
and abusing only one girl.

The movie revolves around super-
nerd Wendell Tvedt (Stephen Geof-
freys) and his two fraternity brothers
as they embark on a Palm Springs
vacation from the winter wastelands
of Iowa. It becomes very obvious
very quickly that Wendell is only
there because his parents furnished
the beach condo. (When his friends
meet two attractive young beach
bunnies and make plans to return to
the condo, Wendell offers to go back
with them and make lemonade).

The plot thickens as two members
of a rival fraternity show up and
decide to make trouble for Wendell

and his buddies. After a good-natured
frat prank, a $1,000 wager is made on
which fraternity man will be the first
to get to know the local beach god-
dess (Sheree Wilson) in the ‘‘physical
sense.”

While the foot race for getting the
goddess in the sack takes place, Wen-
dell makes the best of his vacation by
falling off a roof, getting thrown in
jail and getting thrown out of a re-
staurant by the local chief of police.
Wendell makes it all up in the end as
he walks off into the Iowa sunset arm
in arm with the goddess, leaving bud-
dies behind pondering the values of

nerddom.

“Fraternity Vacation’ has an oc-
casional good moment, but never
does anything to raise itself above
the countless other college break
beach flicks. It does deserve a little
credit for showing a glimpse of how
cruel it can be on the other end of a
college prank.

The biggest fault of the movie goes

to the title. Five guys at the beach .

hardly deserves the billing of ‘‘Fra-
ternity Vacation.” A more descrip-
tive title might have been ‘‘The Nerd
Gets the Goddess” or perhaps even
better, ‘‘Just Another College Beach
Movie.”
