Chief Editors

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty will begin admitting women in
the fall of 1985, the Board of
Trustees decided July 14 after a
two-day special meeting.

The decision ends 235 years of
all-male tradition at Washington
and Lee and leaves only a hand-
ful of all-male, non-military
liberal arts colleges.

The resolution, passed 17-7 by
the trustees after what was
described as a “civil” yet
“vigorous” debate, reads as
follows:

“Resolved, that Washington
and Lee University shall admit
qualified students, regardless of
gender, to all of its degree pro-
grams commencing in the Fall
of 1985.”’

The decision was announced at
a 12:45 p.m. press conference in
the Commerce School. Nearly 50
media representatives attended
the conference. About 100
students and faculty members
watched the press conference on
television monitors in Reid Hall.

Reading from a _ statement
prepared by the board, which
had voted on coeducation at
11:50 a.m., Rector James M.
Ballengee said, ‘‘We are con-
vinced that a stronger Wash-
ington and Lee and a stronger
society will be the happy result
of the decision we have made.”

As many as 100 women will be
admitted in the fall of 1985, said
University President John D.
Wilson, adding that the board
had hoped the school would have
as many as 500 women students
within 10 years.

Wilson spoke of the ‘‘integrity,
honor and character here,’’ as
well as “our superior teaching
and learning and academic pro-
gram.

“We believe that these values
that are so important to Wash-
ington and Lee can and will be
enjoyed by men and women
equally, and that they will help
to contribute to making these as
much a part of the future as they
have been of the past,’’ he con-
tinued.

Wilson also said at the press
conference that he had voted in
favor of the motion, Although he
said he didn’t specifically make
a recommendation to the board,
he was the first member -to
speak on the issue Saturday
morning.

“I suppose that could be con-
strued as a recommendation,”
Wilson said.

Another member of the board,
whom Ballengee declined to

identify, made the motion to

adopt the resolution.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Cole Dawson and former
EC President Robert C. Jene-
vein represented the student
body in the trustees’ closed ses-
sions. Jenevein traveled to the
meeting from Dallas at his own
expense.

Looking worn but enthusiastic,
Dawson talked with reporters
following the trustees’ press con-
ference. “It’s going to take an ef-
fort of the whole student body to

implement coeducation in a
positive way,” he said.

“It was really exciting when it
happened. I still cannot believe
the course of history has chang-
ed right here at Washington and
Lee.”’

Dawson said he was in favor of
coeducation. ‘I didn’t come out
and directly tell them that, ex-
actly,” he said. “I told them at
the end that my feelings were
toward coeducation.”’

“I don’t think the market is
there for an all-male school,” he
added. ‘‘This school’s not
marketable as an all-male in-
stitution.”

Charles D. Hurt Jr. of Atlanta,
president of the Alumni Associa-
tion, and former Alumni
Association President Peter A.
Agelasto III, represented the
alumni at the meeting.

Among reports received by the
board this weekend was an
analysis of an alumni survey
conducted this spring by a Rich-
mond research firm. Of the 6,700
alumni who responded to that
survey, 58.5 percent said they
opposed coeducation, 28.9 per-
cent said they favored it, and
10.6 percent said they had no
opinion.

Although Hurt said he did not
make a specific recommenda-
tion that the board defeat
coeducation, he did say the
board was aware of the alumni’s
feelings because ‘‘we have hada
continuous communication with
the board as a whole as well as
individually.”

Alumni will support the deci-
sion, Hurt added. ‘‘I think the
decision was the right decision,
and | think the alumni will ac-
cept the decision,” he said.

noted that ‘‘within the Board’s
membership itself opinion was
divided, and the vote on the
resolution’s adoption, while
strongly in favor, was not
unanimous. However, now that
the decision is made, the

Trustees are united in pledging

their full commitment to the suc-

cessful implementation of the

University’s new course.’’

At the press conference, Bal-
lengee said, ‘‘We determined in
advance that a decision of this
magnitude should not be made
by what one would call a slim
majority or a narrow majority.”
He added that the number of
votes in favor of coeducation, 17,
exceeded the number of votes
the board had decided to re-
quire, but he declined to identify
that number.

Two other trustees, A. Chris-
tian Compton of Richmond and
Edgar F.. Shannon Jr. of Charlot-
tesville, attended the press con-
ference.

Shannon was president of the
University of Virginia when it
first began accepting female
students.

Compton said he voted against
coeducation ‘‘because I feel that
we have put in place at this
university a fine-tuned educa-
tional machine which is pro-
viding a high-quality education
ina single-sex atmosphere,”’ and
has produced ‘‘a body of
outstanding alumni who have

succeeded eminently in all walks
of life.’’

However, Compton said,
“Those of us who love and sup-
port Washington and Lee will
work just as hard to make
coeducation another positive
factor as far as W&L is concern-
ed.”’

“There is no appeal,” added
Compton, a justice of the
Virginia Supreme Court.

Shannon noted that the board
studied many financial projec-
tions before making the. deci-
sion.

Ballengee described the
discussion preceeding the vote
as “entirely civil, as Washington
and Lee gentlemen should be,
one to another . . . . There were
people with differing points of
view.

“All of the issues that you
could possibly imagine were

-discussed. It was a free, full and

frank discussion. I never heard
anyone raise his voice. On the
whole, it was polite.”

Asked his feelings now that the
debate finally had ended, Wilson
said, ‘I feel exhausted, if you
want to be absolutely candid
about it. It’s been a long and
arduous undertaking, (but)
frankly, a rewarding time.”’

“I’m just looking forward to
having it all be over,’’ he had
said in an interview earlier this
week,

‘‘A decision of this magnitude

gee and Virginia Supreme Court

and complexity involves us all in
the re-examination of this
university and its character.
There is a spirit alive on the
campus, a spirit of humaneness.

“I feel very good about the
decision. I think it was the right
decision to be made,’’ added
Wilson, who, along. with
Ballengee, wore a Washington
and Lee tie to the press con-
ference.

Relaxing at Lee House after
the press conference, Wilson ex-
pressed hope that Washington
and Lee now could begin to pian
for the future in other areas.

Wilson said at the press con-
ference that the trustees
authorized creation of a commit-
tee on coeducation, consisting of
Students, faculty and ad-
ministrators, ‘‘to help guide us

‘in every step of the way.”

Female law students and womer
faculty members will aid th
committee, Wilson added.

Among planned _ improve-
ments to the _ university’s
physical plant are a $4 million to
$5 million dormitory, which has
been in the works for some time,
and about $150,000 worth of
renovations to the gymnasium
areas to provide separate locker
room and shower facilities for
female students.

“I trust that you’re supportive
of that,” Wilson added, with a
laugh.

Opinion

 

No, we’re not going to hell in a handbag

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor
“We made history today.
Weare the future.”

--Mondale toasting Ferraro

Painful as it was, the time had
come to wake up, smell the cof-
fee, and admit women to
Washington and Lee.

The ‘no go co” forces have
reached their Appomatox. Now
it’s time for a little reconstruc-
tion.

The well-intentioned anti-coed
people who fail to see that a well-
fought battle is over are wel-
come to take their marbles and
go home; the rest of us are going
to attempt to make coeducation
the best thing that ever happen-
ed to W&L.

It’s heartsickening to realize
that when I think of the people
who love Washington and Lee
the most and would do anything
for it, Lthink of people adamant-
ly opposed to coeducation. Those
people have to feel betrayed.
The hope has to be, though, that
their regard for the institution is
greater than their devotion to
one particular aspect of it.

This has been a most unplea-
sant civil war. During his 1984
commencement address, Presi-
dent Wilson told the graduates,
“I know it has concerned you
that we seem to be divided on
this important matter, students,
faculty, alumni and staff. But

that may be inevitable on a mat-
ter of such significance, and I
live in the faith that it will not be
a permanently disabling condi-
tion.”

We have to hope he’s right.

Dr. Wilson is not, contrary to
popular opinion, the Grinch that
Stole Single Sex. He is a person
who was willing to be the point
man, and consequently to be
subject to unmitigated garbage,
for a change which he, rightly or
wrongly, believed was the best
path for the institution he’d been
hired to serve.

The Board has said what the
policy will be. It is now incum-
bent upon us, through a com-
bination of respect and coopera-
tion, to assist Dr. Wilson and his
administration in implementing
that policy as effectively and as
smoothly as possible.

The student government will
be an important component of
that effort. As you study history,
it seems that strong leaders ap-
pear when they are most needed.
For the W&L student body, such
a man is Cole Dawson.

His is a tough position. He.
follows the incredibly dedicated

. Bob Jenevein, who, like all pro-

minent men, had vociferous,
persistent critics. Cole, who is
capable, willing to listen, and
possesses integrity of the highest
order, is up to the challenge.
Once an opponent of coeduca-

tion, he changed his mind upon
further research and reflection.
He was, like us, willing to
wholeheartedly support single
sex if that was what was re-
quired of him. The trustees,
however, made what he came to
believe was the better choice.
He, by the way, should be
credited with offering one of the
most cogent observations to sur-
face during the coeducation
debate: ‘‘Everyone’s talking
about ‘male camaraderie.’ What
about female camaraderie?”’

The trustees have reached a
conclusion similar to that of
General Lee in April of 1865. It
was time to cut their losses while
what they had was still worth
saving. Lee realized that the
losses he was sustaining were
unacceptable, that to continue
would invite further decimation
of his turf, and that his men’s
commitment to the cause was
waning. The trustees have made
a similar decision.

We have the rare opportunity

to take a unique and still strong
institution and propel it to even
greater distinction.

The trustees aren’t trying to
take our paradise away from us;
they’re making it possible for us
to enhance it.

The pursuit of excellence, both
in ourselves and in future
students, is the key to the con-
tinued vitality and superiority of
the University.

The time is now. The chance is
ours. The fate is Washington and
Lee’s.

WGL going first class

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

Last summer, before the ques-
tion of coeducation was placed
squarely on Washington and
Lee’s agenda, I was talking with
a co-worker who graduated from
William and Mary College, a
relatively small but highly
regarded coeducational school
in Williamsburg.

The conversation turned to
colleges, and, inevitably, to
Washington and Lee coeduca-
tion. Although partially in jest, a
comment my colleague made
that day forever will remain in
my mind.

“Washington and Lee is being
dragged, kicking and scream-
ing, into the 20th century,” he
said.

I believed then that his com-
ment was fairly accurate, and
since, I have come to realize that
it was even more so. Now, after
last weekend’s decision, we have
really entered the 20th century.

And if each of us works at
making coeducation succeed,
Washington and Lee once again
can join the ranks of the most il-
lustrious colleges in the nation —
a position the school certainly
deserves.

No longer will we have to be
dragged into the 20th century.
We can now move into the 21st
century with our head held high,
knowing that we had the courage
to make a decision — in many
ways unpopular and in all ways
difficult — that will benefit this
university.

Many people assume that Lex-
ington and Washington and Lee
are quiet during the summer.
This is not entirely so. A group of
17-year-olds, rising high school
seniors known as Summer
Scholars — both male and
female — were on campus this

month, participating in various |

programs the university offers.

Also on campus this past week
were tourists — again both male
and female — from all over the
country.

They, too, marveled at the
beauty and grace of Washington
and Lee, and its history and
quality.

We must ask: If they had
visited Blacksburg, would they
have toured Virginia Tech?

New student body president reacts to coed decision

To the editors:

The result of this weekend’s
decision is one that will no doubt
hit a nerve in the heart of
everyone associated with Wash-
ington and Lee.

Never before in W&L’s history
has an issue fostered so much
controversy and stirred so much
emotion. Washington and Lee
has survived many battles and
coed will be another one
—Washington and Lee is and
always will be a distinguished
university, due to its unique
educational atmosphere. It will
continue to produce honorable,
intelligent, well-rounded in-
dividuals who will be the movers
and shakers in our society.

Twenty years ago we were one
of many all-male institutions.
~~We were not simply ‘‘another”’
all-male institution, we were uni-
que and will remain so, for the
same_ reasons, far into the
future. We have a strong tradi-
tion of honor, integrity and
strength of character, along with
the many values and ideals in-
stilled in our university by
General Lee.

After the Civil War, Lee had
been defeated — his belover
South had lost al! that it had
believed in for so long. But he
came to Washington College
with an optimistic attitude that
the future would hoic more
what many believed te he

hopeless

 

strength of character and will to
succeed, he created a fine in-
stitution — a better Washington
and Lee. This may seem trivial
and trite, but we must have
similar courage to strengthen
our university — to use this op-
portunity to bring W&L up to its
full potential.

The chemistry of W&L’s pre-
sent atmosphere will change,
but the fundamental foundation
of the W&L experience will go
on. This weekend’s decision is
hard to swallow. Walking around
campus after the decision, I had
a gut-wrenching feeling in my
stomach that came from the ap-
prehension and uncertainty of
the future. Will the intangibles
so crucial to the W&L experience
be lost, or will the admission of
women strengthen our universi-
ty and all that it stands for?

At one time, Washington and
Lee competed strongly with such
schools as Davidson, Duke and
U.Va. There is no question that
W&L provides a much more uni-
que and broadening education
than these schools, but as of 1983
those schools were only accep-
ting 33 percent of their ap-
plicants to fill their freshman
class, whereas we now accept 60
percent of our applicants. The
percentage has gone from 40

‘recent in 1965 to 49 percent in

982, 57 percent in ’83, and 60 per-
t in ’84. The education: that
‘ers, although unique and

highly regarded by its students
and alumni, is simply not that at-
tractive anymore. I know, as I’m
sure you do, of many who con-
sidered W&L but shied away due
to the single-sex factor —also,
many guys who were W&L
material who came and trans-
ferred due to the all-male
character.

I will truly miss the mystical
all-male quality of W&L, but am
confident that admitting women
is a positive move and one that
will make W&L a stronger in-
stitution in the future.

Contrary to seemingly popular
opinion, it was not President
Wilson who brought coeducation
to the forefront and it is not his
“fault’’ (not a fault at all, in
fact) that we are destined to be a
coeducational institution. I real-
ly believe that we are fortunate
to nave such an outstanding
president. Watching him in the
May board meeting and this
weekend, I have seen an in-
dividual with as much dedica-
tion to Washington and Lee as
any person I have ever seen. His
knowledge and emotions for the
school are admirable and deep-
rooted.

Lastly, let me add that our
present Board of Trustees is the
result of 15 years of careful and
deliberate selection by our
former president, Robert E.R.
Huntley. This board has been
acknowledged as. one of the

strongest groups of individuals
to govern the school in_ its
history. They are all deeply
rooted traditionalists, each of
them as dedicated to the univer-
sity and to the preservation of
the unique quality and character
of education at W&L as the next.
There were tears in their eyes as
they said goodbye to a 235-year-
old tradition, and literally near
tears as they gave their last
statements before the vote.

I know many students and
alumni think W&L’s traditions
have been irrevocably lost. I
hope, though, that you will all
pledge your support for a better
Washington and Lee — the

school we love so much. The
decision was a hard one — one
that took into consideration both
students’ and alumni’s views
very seriously. Almost all day
Friday was ‘spent considering
those opinions. But the decision
has been made and the future
and destiny of W&L has begun a
new course. Listening to W&L’s
Latin motto, “Non in cautus
futuri’’ — ‘“‘Not unmindful of the
future’ — remember this as you
look to tomorrow: We have so
much to gain with a positive at-
titude.

Sincerely,

Cole Dawson

Wilson: ‘Integrity, honor’ make W&L unique

Following are excerpts from
an interview with President
Wilson conducted at Lee House
following the July 14 press con-
ference.

Q. — Throughout the meetings
this weekend, was there ever a
point at which you thought the
board might not be able to reach
a decision?

A. — Well, we spent a long time
discussing the pros and cons of
delay, simply to defer a decision

until students and alumni could |

become more fully acquainted
with the whole range of issues
that the board was struggling
with. That might be efficacious,
but the board finally decided
that would be a very bad thing to
’ do, that it would be better in a
way to reject it than to stretch it
out and to keep secondary
schools, prospective students,
current students and key alumni
all wondering what you were go-
ing to do. I don’t think it was
really necessary. It’s been a long
study, really, about a year.

Q. — What can students who are
here now and will be entering in
the fall do to help smooth the
transition to coeducation?

A. — That is a very, very crucial
part of the whole success that we
hope to achieve. I’m not sure I
have a blueprint in mind now. . .
. I think I’ll sit down with the Ex-
ecutive Committee (in the fall)
and get their suggestions on how
that might work. We’re going to
name a steering committee on
coeducation — they’ll give us ad-
vice and counsel on that. But you
know finally it’s going to depend

upon the generosity of spirit of |

  

the Washington and Lee men to
say that ‘we have a good thing
and we want to share it. The
board has decided we have to
share it with women students
equally and let’s see how to
make it easiest for these girls.’
Q. — Do you think the first few
classes of females might have a
problem fitting in?

A. — I believe that that’s been
the experience at other places —
that’ they have felt they’re going
to be a very small minority for
some years while the numbers
build up. And that’s always a

     

Kien ee §

problem with feeling a little bit
special and a little bit different
before they become integrated
into student life on the
newspaper staff, the radio sta-
tion, student government. That
will take probably a few years. I
am sure there are ways of doing
things, ways of talking, ways of
pretending women aren’t there
that we’ll have to try to remold,
all of us. It will require some
sensitivity. At Yale I think they

found a lot of their organiza-
tional structure had to change.
The Outdoor Club never dreamt
that there would be women ap-
plying. Well, they applied. But I
trust we’ll have little difficulty
with that. But I must say, at
first, when I discovered last fall
how strongly the students felt, or
at that time felt, I was never
sure whether the students were
simply reacting to the idea or
whether they were taking real
thought about the future and
well-being of their alma mater. I
think, as the year went on, as

_ more and more factors were

brought out into the open, that
some of that sharp antagonism
tended to soften.

Q. — Why did you take so long to
express directly your opinion on
the issue?

A. — Let me say this, that my
opinion was formed, again, over
an evolutionary process over
time. I had a meeting with my
staff up on the mountain in July
of last summer. Of course, I ar-
rived in January. My faculty
conversations began then in
earnest; I had had fall conversa-
tions with staff about various
aspects of university life. Thén
when I got here, I started these
faculty conversations and then
my senior dinners went on that
spring. And by May I had learn-
ed enough from the admissions
side about the quality and
declines in the key areas. It is
not easy to dismiss the fact that
we have fewer students from the
upper quintile of their high
school graduating classes today
than we had 15 years ago,
remarkably fewer, you can’t

 

Opinion

If they had visited Richmond,
would they have toured Virginia
Commonwealth University?

Perhaps not. Although both -

are good universities, they .are
missing ‘something that Wash-
ington and Lee has. It’s an in-
tangible that’s difficult to
describe, but it extends beyond
the ‘‘all-male spirit” of which we
are so proud. Perhaps it has
something to do with the stately
Colonnade, its freshly painted
columns shining in the summer
sun, the ivy climbing up the back
of its buildings. Or perhaps it is
the new library and Law School,
modern buildings that blend in
so well with those constructed
200 years ago. Or perhaps it is
the statue of George Washington
atop the building named after
him, visible from anywhere on
campus, seeming to watch over
us all.

Now, though, we can make the
further improvements and
changes necessary to return to
that upper echelon of colleges
and universities. Washington
and Lee can once again become
a force to be reckoned with,
rather than a small, liberal] arts
school in the Shenandoah Valley
that is offering a choice fewer

ss iH . « r +tHyy o
and fewer college-age students

seem to want.

Washington and Lee’s doors no
longer will be closed to women.
No longer will we have to turn
away more than 50 percent of the
population. No longer will the
fine education of Washington
and Lee be available to men
alone.

That, I believe, is the crucial
point. What right does (or did)
Washington and Lee have to
deny an education to a woman?

Those tourists this weekend,
those Summer Scholars, ob-
viously found the Washington
and Lee campus and atmos-
phere enjoyable and enlighten-
ing. Several female Summer
Scholars promised to apply here
next year for the fall of 1985.
They realize that the first few
classes of women at Washington
and Lee may have difficulties,
but they were willing to risk that
for a chance to participate in the
Washington and Lee experience.

And we have no right to deny
them that opportunity, based on
a philosophy that became out-
dated in the mid-1900s and seems
archaic today.

The Board of Trustees made
the right decision this weekend
— the decision that had to be
made. In many cases, they may
have put their true persona! feel-

ings aside for the betterment of
this university.

The debate over coeducation
undoubtedly has been long. It
has lasted sporadically for more
than 15 years. Opinions have
fluctuated wildly. Students,
faculty and alumni have
disagreed on the issues. There
has been a great deal of discus-
sion about this university and its
place in American collegiate
society.

But this introspective discus-
sion, whether for or against
coeducation, has been helpful.
We have undergone a rigorous
process of self-examination and
have found faults with the
system in areas other than those
related to coeducation. Without
question, Washington and Lee
has lost something by the deci-
sion — but we have gained more.

With the settlement of the
coeducation question, we can
now turn to fixing those other
problems. Now is the time to put
aside the arguments and the bit-
terness, the slogans and the
bumper stickers.

We all must join together, so
that Washington and Lee can
stride boldly and aggressively
into the future — as the two
great men who gave us our name
would have wanted us to do

just say, ‘Well, heck.’ That’s an
important factor in keeping this
place strong and in keeping the
respect of the school. When I
spoke to the alumni association
in May, I said, ‘I’m going to
mention something you’re not
going to want me to mention but
it’s something I think we’re go-
ing to have to look at.’ That was
in May, but I was still a long way
from knowing what my own
mind would be. Last summer,
when I was up on the mountain
with my staff — just the ad-
ministration, we spent two days
up there — and that was only one
topic, but it was the last one, and
we talked it all through. At that
point, I said, ‘I really do think
this is something that the
board’s going to have to look at.’
But I am not sure even then that
I was then tending toward a
positive evaluation of the pro-
spect. But I have — oh, I can’t
remember how many alumni
groups I’d met by that time;
there were not all that many, it
was in the next year that I went
out to some 30 or 40. I talked to
people from the paper I wrote in
October, I started to get feed-
back. And that’s when you start
to question yourself. I had self-
doubts about this all along. I did
think it was right to raise the
questions associated with it. But
I was perfectly prepared, for ex-
ample, to have the board say, ‘I
think it’s the right thing to do,
probably, but this is the wrong
time to do it or that the alumni
disaffection might be so strong
as to make it not wise.’ So I
didn’t declare myself early
because I hadn’t really made up
my mind in any firm, firm way
until fairly recently. It was pret-
ty widely known that I wouldn’t
have. permitted the subject to
arise at all if I had found it an ab-
solutely unacceptable alter-
native to the university. That’s
what upset some of the alumni.
They assumed that I must have
come here with my mind made
up. I came here, having talked
with the board about it, the
board committee on presidential
search, and that committee said,
‘How do you feel about coeduca-
tion? How do you think about
coeducation?’ We talked at some
length, and I said I thought that
the institution’s decision in the
earlier years not to endorse
coeducation was admirable if it
was proud of what it was doing
and if it was healthy and it was
expert at educating men in isola-
tion, . . . then I had not any
logical difficulty with that. If, on
the other hand, we entered into
difficulties, I said that then I
wouldn't hesitate to raise it with
the board. And they said, ‘Well,
we would want you to do that.’

Q. — Which of the advantages of
coeducation was the most impor-

tant to the board?

A. — The academic quality,
without question.

Q. — Even more than the
demographics?

A. — Oh, yes. The question that
the board asked is ‘How can this

institution improve its academic
standing, ensure its reputation
of academic excellence?’ That
was the question. ‘And by re-
maining all-male, what chances
do we have of that? By changing,
what chances do we have of
that?’ The board committees all
reported out in due course. The
Campus Life committee con-
cluded in its examination that
co-curricular life, extra-
curricular life would on balance
be better with men and women
together. The Academic Affairs
committee report said on
balance, in fact, the academic
quality of our students would im-
prove and the quality of
discourse in the classroom and
the whole ambiance of the
academic side of life.

Q. — You said that Washington
and Lee was unique in ways
other than being all-male. Now
that. we are coeducational, what
are some of those other ways in
which we are unique?

A. — Of course, any institution
can make claims of that sort, but
I do think there’s a pattern of
success here that is traceable to
a heightened sense of mutual
caring. I don’t want to exag-
gerate that, but I think the
students have a lot of respect for
each other and look out for each
other and have a lot of respect
for the faculty and vice versa, so
that creates an environment of,
we call it civility, but of mutual
trust. That translates still fur-
ther into an absolute willingness
by the faculty to meet with
students and to be of help to
them, in their personal lives as
well as in their academic work,
and that, in turn, I think, has
managed to contribute to the
cultivation of self-confidence,
and ultimately we have a
greater measure of success in
the world. I think that it is im-
portant for us to try to recruit
classes with the same human
qualities in our women students
that we’ve managed over the
years to have represented in our
male student population. In
other words, I think character
and integrity and honor and a
desire to learn — all of these
things are important parts of
Washington and Lee and I am
most anxious to ensure that
those qualities are enhanced by
our women students.
Q. Do you think we’ll have any
problem recruiting women?
A. I think the whole admissions
area is going to be very difficult
for all colleges and universities,
when the University of Penn-
sylvania opens a West Coast of-
fice of admissions, and Oberlin
sends out messages to its alumni
hat new admissions efforts are
oing to be required to get
through this decade — these are
strong institutions, coeduca-
tional institutions — I have no
doubt that our work will be cut
out for us. I think this decision
will help us in that work, but I
don’t think it will provide some
quick solution.

Although Washington and
Lee’s athletic department will
feel many of the effects of
coeducation, Athletic Director
William McHenry expressed op-
timism that the changes will not
be too drastic.

One of the major concerns in
the athletic department was that
coeducation without an increase
in total enrollment — the change
approved by the Board of
Trustees July 14 — would reduce
the pool of prospective male
athletes, causing a drop in the
quality of W&L sports.

But McHenry said in an inter-
view after the decision that only
the sports with larger squads
—such as football, baseball and
soccer — will feel the effects.

“J think probably in some
sports there won’t be a negative

effect at all,”’ McHenry said.
At the press conference an-

nouncing the coed decision,
university President John D.
Wilson predicted a $150,000 in-
itial cost for the changes needed
on the Warner Center.

McHenry said these will in-
clude dividing the locker room in
half, providing separate en-
trances to the weight room and
the old pool, and adding more of-
fices on the upper level of the
gym. :

Another change required by
coeducation will be the addition
of female staff members, in-
cluding a women’s athletic
director anda trainer.

“I would hope that there would
not be an elimination of any of
our current coaches and
teachers,” McHenry said.

McHenry predicted that addi-
tional field space, which he said
was needed even if W&L remain-
ed all-male, would include an ar-
tificial, all-weather field, an all-
weather track and one or two
more playing fields.

The first female varsity sports
to be introduced will probably be
limited to individual] sports, such
as swimming, track, golf and
cross-country, McHenry said,
with five or six sports offered in
the first two years and 10 to 12
within five years.

 

Coed

Cj continued from page 1

Some of the 17 fraternities
‘could go under”’ because of the
decreased male _ population,
Wilson said, although he noted
that some of those are already
financially unstable.

‘We do have a commitment to
our fraternities,’’ Wilson added.
‘“‘Even now, they’re undergoing
some self-reformation, and
we’re going to encourage that in
every way possible.”’

The possibility of sororities on
campus will be discussed when
the women arrive in 1985, Wilson
said. J

Twenty-two of the board’s 25
members are alumni.

Thomas K. Wolfe, who was
elected to the board in
December but ‘has not been
sworn in, did not, attend., the
meeting because ‘of a ‘weekend
deadline on the serialized novel
he is writing for Rolling Stone.

T. Hal Clarke voted by

telephone from Scotland, where
he was traveling, and J. Alvin
Philpott voted by telephone from
North Carolina.

A number of press accounts of
the event took note of the days on
which the trustees’ discussions
were held. ‘“‘Yes, we know that
yesterday was Friday the 13th
and that today is Bastille Day,”
News Office Director Jeffrey G.

Hanna said in a press kit
distributed at the news con-

ference.

Wilson said in an interview
before the meeting that he
hadn’t expected ‘fhe degree of
broader public i@ferest in the
decisionhere.”

“The hoopla conénues around
us,” he said. ‘That all, frankly,
surprises me, but: it does in-
dicate that Washington and Lee
has a special place in Virginia
and in the South, especially. Peo-
ple are interested in what hap-
pens here.”’ st a

Wilson, who assumed the
presidency early in 1983, receiv-
ed criticism from several

quarters while the debate and ~

study on coeducation were in
progress. Prior to the trustees’
meeting, he was asked how a
decision one way or the other
would affect him as a person and
as an administrator.

‘“ There are some who do
believe that I came with a set-
tled mind on the question and
are in some measure alienated
from me personally,” he said.

“If the decision is to admit
young women to degree can-
didacy, how soon will the
students and alumni members
who opposed it reconcile
themselves to it? Will they at all,
and if so, when? Mixed up in
that, somehow, is how soon, if at
all, they will be willing to give
support to my administration.”

The issue of coeducation has
been debated frequently at
W&L, beginning in 1888.

 

The Board of Trustees’ decision to begin admitting women to
Washington and Lee in the fall of 1985 evoked many reactions from

faculty, students and staff who were on campus for the decision:

¢ Former EC President Robert C. Jenevein, who once vigorously
opposed coeducation but says he has since modified his position,
looked tired and disconsolate after the meeting, but said he hoped
the students would make coeducation work.

“They have to open their arms to the new Washington and Lee,”’
he said. ‘‘That won’t be impossible by any stretch of the imagina-
tion.”’

e Nearly 100 faculty and students watched the press conference
on television monitors in Reid Hall. For the most part, they greeted
Ballengee’s words with applause and listened attentively to the re-
mainder of the press conference, chuckling appreciatively at the
appropriate moments.

¢ Among those watching with interest was Peter Whitehead, who
graduated in May but was one of the leading pro-coeducation
students. Whitehead had unfurled a banner at the Mock
Democratic Convention that read: “Better Coeds than
Deadheads.’

“I think the trustees made an unpopular decision, but it was a
good one,”’ Whitehead said. ‘‘I am pleased. Now I think we’ll see
better male and female students.”

-e Another student who came to Lexington to hear the decision
was Scott Tilley, a rising senior and opponent of coeducation.

“I was very disappointed,”’ Tilley said. ‘“‘Up to the last moment, I
didn’t think they’d doit.

“‘T think Washington and Lee as an institution is going to thrive
and will continue, but I have the feeling that as of today, the
Washington and Lee I’ve come to know and love no longer exists.’’

¢ Dr. Louis W. Hodges, a professor of religion and ethics who led
a committee which studied coeducation in 1969, called it ‘‘just a
splendid decision.”’

“I can’t imagine anything that would have done more to improve
the. education environment,’’ he said. ‘‘The board is to be com-
mended. They worked at it very carefully, and rendered what is
certainly the right decision.” ‘

¢ A faculty member who opposed coeducation and asked not to be
identified because he says he plans ‘‘to keep a low profile hence-
forth,” said the initial female applicants to W&L are likely to be
‘young ladies on the prowl.”’

‘“‘Washington and Lee is going to become Fort Lauderdale
North,”’ he said. ‘‘Most girls are going to enroll here because this is
‘Where the Boys Are.’ ”’

e In the face of all the philosophical and academic viewpoints of
the day, some were more concerned about the practical implica-
tions of the decision. ‘‘Big John” Alexander, who has been a W&L
custodian for 10 years, said he opposed coeducation.

‘“‘Women are one of the most beautiful things God put on earth,
but they’re so much messier than men,” he said very seriously.

¢ Betty Munger, who said she advocated coeducation in the 16
years she was the W&L bookstore manager, was amused but not
surprised at all the media attention given the vote. ‘‘It is interesting
that a small college in the backhills of Virginia should be debating
whether to educate women,” she said.

e As President John D. Wilson exited the news conference, he
made a jesting reference to his daughter, Sara, who will be a high
school junior in the fall.

‘IT want you all to know my daughter won’t be coming here,” he
said. ‘I didn’t want to be accused of being self-serving.”
