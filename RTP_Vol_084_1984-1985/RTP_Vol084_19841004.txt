Frats, Hill clash
about regulations

Four-party

rule ended
until winter

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The widely criticized
fraternity party restrictions that
took effect this year were passed
with the knowledge and consent
of student leaders, Dean of Stu-
dents Lewis G. John emphati-
cally told an argumentative stu-
dent gathering Monday night.

More than 50 students packed
the Executive Committee room
to discuss the restrictions, which
many see as the focal point of a
battle between fraternities and
the administration.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee last Thursday suspended the
much-debated ‘‘four parties per
term” rule until winter term,
when the student activities
pavilion will be ready for full
use,

Unchanged, though, is the
mandate that Wednesday night
parties be open only to members
of the house sponsoring the party
and their dates.

Those rules and others came
in for harsh criticism Monday
from students, many of whom
maintainted that the restrictions
unfairly inhibit campus social
life.

EC President Cole Dawson in-
vited fraternity presidents, SAC
members, Interfraternity Coun-
cil members and students to the
discussion, which was held as
part of the weekly EC meeting.

All five faculty members of
the SAC attended: Dean John,
Associate Dean of Students Dan
Murphy and Professors John
Evans, Marshall Follo and Sam-
uel Kozak. One of the duties of
the SAC, which also has five stu-
dent members, is to govern all
matters related to fraternities.

John said the widely casti-
gated regulations were proposed
by last year’s student body and

IFC presidents — Bob Jenevein

and Emery Ellinger —and pass-
ed by the SAC and the University
Council.

The four-party rule was ap-
proved with the understanding
that two houses can hold four
joint parties at each house per
term, and that the pavilion can
be used for parties involving
more than one house.

Evans said the intent of this
rule and the reason for the pavi-
lion were to reduce the wear on
the fraternity houses, which
alumni see as having deter-
iorated in recent years.

“They’re not comfortable with
the amount of people you pack i in
there,’’ Evans said.

Another rule limits Wednes-
day parties to the members of
the fraternity and their dates

and moves the weekly band in
the Cockpit from Tuesday to
Wednesday nights.

More than 50 people squeezed into the Ex-
ecutive Committee room Monday night to par-
ticipate in a discussion about the new rules affec-

ting fraternity parties this year. Among those in -

attendance were the faculty members of the Stu-

dent Affairs Committee, including Dean of
Students Lewis G. John and Associate Dean of

U. Va.:

ANALYSIS

 

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE —‘“‘Miss Fawcett, do you
believe that you have had a fair and just trial?”’

The University of Virginia sophomore, dressed
in a bright pink sweater, white blouse and striped
skirt, paused nearly 30 seconds before respon-
ding.

“T can’t... I can’t honestly say that what’s
been presented by the accusers is all true,” she
said in a halting voice.

Leaning forward, Bobby Blue, chairman of the
trial jury, told Miss Fawcett that she had not
answered the question, and repeated it.

After another pause, Miss Fawcett answered
softly, “Yes, I do.”’

Four hours later, sobbing gently in her
boyfriend’s arms, Monique R. Fawcett of Farm-
ville, Va., left the Honor Committee room in
Newcomb Hall on the U.Va. campus. Found guil-
ty of lying by a 12-student jury, she had just been
expelled from the university.

Unlike the result of most honor trials at U.Va.
(and at Washington and Lee), Miss Fawcett’s
fate quickly would become a subject of campus
discussion. Her name and photograph were plast-
ered across the top of the front page of Monday
morning’s Cavalier Daily.

When’ she left the Honor Committee room,

A look at an honor trial

where Sunday’s 12-hour trial had been held,
representatives of the media obligingly moved
out of her way, respecting her right to privacy in
an obviously traumatic moment.

The presence of the media at the open trial was
one of many differences between an open trial at
the 11,000-student University of Virginia and one
at Washington and Lee, whose undergraduate
student body is about one-tenth that size.

Washington and Lee open honor trials — open
only to W&L students and faculty — are not sup-
posed to be discussed outside the W&L communi-
ty. No one may take notes during the trial, and
The Ring-tum Phi never uses the accused’s name
in any story it might print about the trial.

Such is not the case at the school founded by
Thomas Jefferson, where the honor system is
several years older than ours. A U.Va. student’s
public trial is open to the scrutiny not only of the
university community, but of anyone else who
wishes to attend.

Sunday’s open trial, the first since 1906 that was

‘not an appeal, was attended by about 35 spec-

tators and a dozen members of the media, in-
cluding Charlottesville radio and television sta-
tions and The Associated Press.

In order to be admitted, spectators and the
media had to obtain passes from the Honor Com-
mittee the week before the trial. The Honor Com-

mittee room is only about twice the size of W&L’s

Executive Committee meeting room.

Yes, it would
be funny if.

Most of us have sat around
with friends and_ said,
‘“‘Wouldn’t it be funny if...?”’
Well, some Young Democrats
did that last week, and it sort
of got out of hand.

A few Y.D.s, anticipating a
Nov. 6 landslide and anxious
not to let another fad pass
them by, said, ‘‘Wouldn’t it be
funny if...we endorsed Bozo, I
mean Bonzo?”’

Well, people with little ears
tend to have big mouths, and it
wasn’t long before word was
going around that the Y.D.s
were actually going to endorse
Ronald Reagan.

“Whoever leaked it, leaked
it without knowing that it was
a joke,”’ said James K. Mur-
phy, president of the club.

So, folks, it is just a joke.

It’s amazing how these
things get started. Wouldn’t be
funny if...during a microphone
test, the President said he was
going to bomb Russia?

The Y.D.s might actually

Debating for votes

Presidential debates are once more upon us.

Four years ago, most college students probably
yawned through the Carter-Reagan debates. We
heard how Amy Carter was concerned about nuclear
weapons. Ronald Reagan, when he wasn’t telling
Carter, ‘“There you go again,” was sharing a vision
for an America restored to greatness by tax cuts, less
government and a strong defense.

The result of that debate, of course, is history.
Carter lives in Plains, Ga., a self-trained woodworker
and occasional critic of the Reagan administration.
Reagan lives in the White House when he is not on
vacation.

In 1984, the three debates of the Presidential
election— two between Mssrs. Mondale and Reagan
and one featuring Ms. Ferraro and Mr. Bush — will
indeed affect the election on Nov. 6. Some political
analysts discount their effect, noting that a propor-
tionately small amount of the electorate — 10 percent
— is undecided on its choice for the highest office in
the land. Ronald Reagan is leading Walter Mondale in
the most recent polls by anywhere from 15 to 20 per-
cent. Why debate? Let’s have another landslide!

But if the electorate tunes in on Oct. 7, 11 (to see the
Ferraro-Bush duel) or 21, opinions might be swayed.
We ought not to discount the importance of debates or
the ability of those involved to debate with vigor and
effectiveness.

Consider Walter Mondale. His media image has
varied from wimp to sap to quiche-eater since San
Francisco. He has been seen as a man who promises
the world to everyone, including the feminists,
teachers, gays, unions and blacks. His voice has been
whiney and downright tedious. His speaking style, un-
til last week’s fiery speech at George Washington
University, had all but garnered him the Sominex
Award for Sleeping Excellence. Crowds heckle him.
He was featured in a parade in New York City and no

‘one showed up to see him. It seems there are born

losers and then there are Walter Mondales.

Reagan, on the other hand, couldn’t appear to be do-
ing any better. His campaign appearances have been
before large cheering crowds. His speeches have been
upbeat and optimistic and delivered with all the flair
of an accomplished actor. Those familiar themes of
prosperity, peace and promise have become
trademarks of the Reagan campaign. His hair is not
yet gray, and his hearing, when he wants to hear a
question, is improved. He is a leader, the leader. He
probably even wears red, white and blue boxer
shorts.

Despite his seemingly invincible lead, however, the
President remains the one with the most to lose. He
has led a sheltered existence these past few weeks.
Reporters and camera crews have had limited ques-
tion and photo opportunities. The tragic Beirut bomb-
ing has made a nick in Reagan’s teflon coating. His
fumbling on the question of who’s to blame seems to
be backfiring. His command of the facts surrounding
that bombing, and countless other important issues,
has been questionable.

Walter Mondale, on the other hand, has everything
to gain (or lose) by the debates. He has proven a for-
midable debater with all the practice from the elong-
ated primary season. His command of the facts has
been astounding, especially when he gets heated. If he
charges after Reagan with an array of accurate facts,
he could catch Reagan off-guard. As the challenger,
he can be more aggressive and not risk the negative
image voters often associate with such boldness. He
just might be able to convince the Archie Bunkers of
the United States that he could really handle — or
even prefers — hamburger to quiche.

It actually happened

Some of the events of the first
month of this final year of male
chauvinism as we know it makes
us think that perhaps Ms. Wond-
erland spent some time here at
Washington and Lee. Join us for
a peek back through the Lex-

ton looking glass.

Your hose or mine? At least
those EC guys enjoy their jobs.
Now they don’t josh about ther-
monuclear war, like they did last
year (Reagan seems to be taking
up the slack), but they still have
a good time. For example, after
a heated exchange between stu-
dents and administrators over
increased social restrictions, the
ever-spunky Andrew Caruthers
had just the solution: ‘“Maybe

 

I promise

we should require ties at Wed-
nesday night parties.”

I liked it so much, I bought the
committee. The EC was in the
market for a recording/ tran-
scribing system early this year
(that’ll run you several hundred
dollars, by the way), and smooth
Sam Dalton said his research
showed that the best system was
made by Norelco. “Do you get a
free shaver with that?’’ asked

Communication is the answer

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter in
response to the question of frat-
ernity regulation. Hopefully this
issue will not lead to the animosi-:
ty we felt last year with the coed
debate. With good sense and
reasonable negotiation, we can
nip this problem in the bud.

Battle lines have been drawn
between the Hill and the frater-
nities, and it bothers me to see
such an adversarial condition
develop. This has not been the
case in the past and there is no
need for it to continue in the
future. The students and faculty
need to regain the lost sense of
mutual respect and harmony
that characterize the school.

The student-faculty relation-
ship, however, cannot be im-
proved by dictatorial proclama-
tions from the Hill. Such a prac-
tice insults every student’s sense
of responsibility and adulthood.
Democracy clearly does not ex-
ist when the students’ views are
not fairly represented.

I do not intend, of course, to
drop a guilt clause upon the fac-
ulty for igniting this conflict. As
responsible Washington and Lee
men, we all share a little of the
blame for arousing concern over
our social customs. Sure, we get
drunk and sometimes we overdo
it. But college would not be col-

lege if we led only a monastic life

of study. .Lhe faculty. certainly...

To me, the problem
transcends the trivial question of
Wednesday night parties. The
heart of the problem lies in the
breakdown of communication
between the students and facul-
ty. And until relations improve,
a standoff will only perpetuate
the crisis and worsen the
students’ situation.

The answer is not rebellion
—that has proven unsuccessful
in the past. Rather, we should
move to increase our voice on
the Hill through such commit-
tees as the SAC and the IFC until
the decisions which they render
reflect again the opinion of the
student body.

Cost conscious. We thought
this sign over the soft drink ma-

touch: “Fill all cups 2/3 full of
ice. Always.” It has since been
removed.

Nice try. The fraternities were

houses wearing a ‘‘Tappa Keg”’

ago, a guy had just struck up a
conversation with a girl (excuse
us, woman) when one of his fra-

him, ‘‘Abuse her. She thinks
Puerto Rico’s a state.”’ He did.
She actually did.

Translation. During freshman
orientation, the familiar notice
was posted in the halls saying
that for dinner with faculty ad-

“Customary usually means re-

Ballet, which is ‘not for wimps,
is free to all WGL ‘macho men’

From Staff Reports

It’s free and it’s good for you.

And we’re not even talking
about Brussels sprouts.

Washington and Lee students
are able to attend presentations
of the Rockbridge Concert-Thea-
tre Series at no charge because
of donations made to the pro-
gram by the university.

The first event of this season is
a performance by the Joffrey
Ballet on Sun., Oct. 14, the day
after Homecoming.

“I want the guys out in
droves,” said A.P. Smith, execu-
tive director of the series, which
offers among its other attrac-
tions this season Dizzy Gillespie,
the American Boychoir and
‘Hansel and Gretel’”’ performed
by the Cincinnati Opera.

The Joffrey performance
begins at 3 p.m. at Lexington
High School.

A university contribution of 25
cents per student, per perfor-
mance makes complimentary
student admission possible. Cost
for a date’s ticket is $5.

A mailing offering discounted
tickets for the entire series will
reach student mailboxes next
week.

Mrs. Smith, wife of a W&L

“the New York Times-Dis-
patch” every day.

I don’t know, but you’re a
cancer. Recently a girl at a
fraternity which shall remain
nameless actually came up to a
guy and said, ‘‘What’s your
sign?” To which the appropriate
response is: “‘I’ll be right back,
but I have to refill this. May I get
you anything?”

This is a weird place.

Isn’t it great?

journalism professor, said vigor-
ous student support of the per-
formances would dispel two no-
tions about W&L students: that
“because there are no girls here,
you’re uncouth macho men’”’ and
that ‘“‘you don’t do enough ser-
vice in the community.”

She said she hopes to arouse
student interest in these cultural
offerings before the advent of
coeducation.

“The girls are going to get the
credit for dragging you into
these performances,’’ she said.
“I don’t think the reason you’re
not coming is that there aren’t
any girls here.”

“Undergraduates have not
developed their artistic taste to
the point where going to a per-
formance other than to a rock
concert is of any importance to
them,’’ she continued.

Mrs. Smith, who has a doc-
torate in education from the Col-
lege of William and Mary, said
W&L men would be missing an
extraordinary experience by
skipping the Oct. 14 perfor-
mance.

“Ballet is the ultimate use of
the human body, its voice and its
mind to present life not as it is,
but as it ought to be at its
height,” she said. ‘‘It is a glori-
fication of the body, and the
most taxing of all physical acti-
vities.”’

“It’s not for wimps,’’ she add-
ed. ‘‘They have to make twirling
a 125-pound body look like throw-
ing around ostrich feathers, and
that’s not easy.”’

The organization was founded
more than 38 years ago by Mary
M. Penick, who now lives in
Roanoke.

“I was embarrassed,” Miss
Penick said. ‘‘They had good
concert series in Staunton and
Lynchburg, and at Sweet Briar
and Hollins. Lexington was the
only one that didn’t have
something like that.”’

“I love Lexington,”’ she said in
explaining her reasons for start-
ing the Series. ‘I grew up in a
house that my family had lived
in for three generations.”’

“It gives me a lot of satisfac-
tion to know that the series has
lasted,” she added. ‘I suppose
thousands of people have seen
these events over the years.”’

Mrs. Smith, who works out re-
gularly for ballet and weightlift-
ing and is training for a mara-
thon, said she hopes W&L men
will at least give the Joffrey per-
formance a try.

“When you ask students if
they’ve been to a performance
like this, they say, ‘Well, no, but
I know I wouldn’t like it,’ ’’ she
chided. ‘“‘That’s the stupidest
possible reason for not going.

- You guys are too bright for it.’”’

Committee to study school’s policies on felons

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

At the suggestion of the
Washington and Lee Board of
Trustees, a committee has been
formed to study the University’s
policies toward drug felony con-
victions, President John D. Wil-
son said yesterday.

“The committee will be re-
viewing the current University
policies and practices bearing
upon the institution’s response to
drug offenses,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘It
will also call for a review of the
institution’s various policy state-
ments bearing upon infractions
of the criminal code.”’

Psychology Professor Leo-
nard E. Jarrard has been named

chairman of the Drug Policy
Review Committee, which also
will include Dean of Students
Lewis G. John, accounting Pro-
fessor Jay D. Cook, journalism
Professor Robert J. deMaria,
religion Professor Louis W.
Hodges and chemistry Professor
Michael A. Pleva. Seniors Darby
Brower and Bob Tomaso and
third-year law student Peter
Baumgaertner will represent
the student body on the commit-
tee.

Wilson said he was pleased
with the makeup of the commit-
tee and feels the variety of
backgrounds will aid the com-
mittee. “Dean John will be
valuable for his past knowledge
of how the University handled

these situations. Dr. Jarrard can
give a scientific view of the
situation and Dr. Hodges can
give an ethical view,” he said.
Jarrard teaches a spring term
course on psychoactive drugs
and behavior during the spring
term, and Hodges is head of the
University’s ethics program.

Jarrard noted that the title of
the committee is restrictive.
“The committee will be looking
beyond simply drug policy re-
view,”’ he said. “‘We will also
look at whether or not there is
enough drug education and coun-
seling going on at W&L and will
look into getting some speakers
in.”

Among questions the commit-
tee should ask, Wilson said, are,

‘‘Must we treat all felony convic-
tions as (potential) grounds for
disciplinary action? Does it mat-
ter whether the offense was com-
mitted in Lexington or at home?
Against a member of the Univer-
sity or a townsman?”’

Wilson also raised the question
of whether a W&L degree car-
ries a testimony that reaches
beyond academic competence.
‘“‘Does a diploma from
Washington and Lee signify just
the completion of rigorous
academic requirements or does
it also make a statement about
the character of the individual
who has that diploma?”’

Although these may be dif-
ficult questions to answer,
Wilson said, they are important

and need to be addressed. ‘‘I feel
that too many students don’t
realize the seriousness of a drug
conviction,’ he said. ‘“‘The im-
plications of any kind of felony
conviction will follow a student
the rest of his life.”’

The board recommended for-
mation of the committee at its
meeting last May, following a
seven-month investigation by a
special grand jury of drug traf-
ficking and use in_ the
Rockbridge County area.

In its report, the special grand
jury said, ‘‘There is, indeed, a
large circle of drug dealers and
users within the area, affecting
all age groups, from high schools
through the two colleges...”

“Thursday morning classes
have almost been wrecked by
Wednesday night parties,”’
Evans said.

 

‘‘Most of us are convinced that

they are an extremely destruc-
tive part of the university,’’ he
added. ‘‘It’s dangerous to have
your students barely conscious
half the time.”’

‘“‘We are indeed trying to
reduce the size of Wednesday
night parties,’’ Murphy said.

Murphy added that as long as
the university was giving reduc-
ed interest rates on the mort-
gages of houses owned by the
university, the school should be

 

able to have some power over
the fraternities.

Some students said it should
be the student’s decision wheth-
er he goes to parties or studies
on Wednesday nights.

Evans said the faculty has ‘‘an
overwhelming responsibility to
the academic part of the univer-
sity.”’

“The faculty that have been
here for a long time realize that
the academic level of students is
much less than it was 10 or 15
years ago,” he said.

“There are members of this
faculty that have been here 35
years,”’ Murphy added. ‘‘I think
you have to appreciate that
there is a long-term commit-
ment to consider, too.

good time endanger the long- ~

term health of the institution and
that is, finally, what happens.”

Some students still protested
that restricting Wednesday par-
ties to members of the fraternity
was not only unfair but possibly
counterproductive.

Evans said that restriction
was added because the SAC
didn’t want freshmen fraternity
members to feel compelled to at-
tend Wednesday parties.

Phi Kappa Psi member John
Lewis and sophomore EC repre-
sentative Andrew Caruthers
said the Wednesday night rule
will increase the divisions bet-
ween the fraternities.

“It’s the worst thing in the
world to come up to a door of
another fraternity house and
have a friend of yours say,
‘Sorry you can’t come in,’ ”
Lewis said.

In addition, he said parties at
the pavilion would be ‘“‘horrible”’

because of the size of the build-
ing.

“I'd really rather be at my
fraternity house, where I don’t
have to pay admission and I can
see my friends,’ added Jamie
Berger of Phi Kappa Psi.

“The students just felt that a
train had hit them’”’ when they
heard about the new rule, he ad-
ded.

Senior Louis Jehl of Phi Delta
Theta said that if students had
communicated with their repre-
sentatives, they would have
known about the proposed rules.

“We don’t have anybody to
blame but ourselves because
we’ve been unmotivated,’’ he
said.

Phi Delta Theta President
Reynolds Thompson said every-
one would be happier if the frat-
ernities were given a chance to
improve themselves.

shoot for, and if they fail, then

Thompson said. “But give them
a chance first.”’

Murphy said that other col-
leges had dealt with their frater-
nity problems by opening frater-
nities to anyone who wanted to
join or by disbanding the frater-
nities.

“T think in contrast with many
of the schools mentioned,”’ John
added, “‘this university is show-
ing support for its fraternities.”

John said he was concerned
that the new rules already are
being violated this year.

“That’s part of our frustra-
tion, that regulations are made
and they’re just broken,” John
said.

EC President Dawson agreed
that was a problem.

“Why don’t we try to live
under these rules?’’ he asked.
“‘Let’s give the system a chance
and try to make relations nicer.”’

Wood wins
EC position

Brandt Wood was elected
freshman class Executive Com-
mittee representative and An-
drew Abernathy was chosen
class president in last week’s
run-off elections.

The run-off, held last Thurs-
day, drew 257 freshmen, a larger
turnout than in the initial elec-
tion, in which 198 students voted.

Wood, who was sworn in at

Monday’s EC meeting by Dean
of Students Lewis G. John, said
he is happy and honored to be
representing his class. “I cam-
paigned hard and it paid off,”
said Wood, who won 45 percent
of the vote.

Publicity

increases

interest in W&L

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee admis-
sions officers, returning from
initial recruiting efforts and
“college night’’ visits across the
country, report a continued high
interest in the university among
high school students — both
male and female.

Admissions counselor Bennett
Ross credited the increased in-
terest to both the coeducation
decision and last year’s U.S.
News and World Report article
that ranked W&L as the best
smaller comprehensive univer-
sity east of the Mississippi.

Ross said that during a recent
visit to 17 high schools on Long
Island, he talked to 130 students
about W&L, compared with the
60 students he met at the same
schools last year. Ross said he
was also much busier than last
year when he visited the Long
Island College Fair, an annual
event that attracts about 16,000
high school seniors.

Ross added that the increased
interest in W&L he encountered
was not just a fluke because
other admissions office person-
nel who had visited the West
Coast, Houston, Dallas and At-
lanta also reported increased in-
terest in W&L.

“‘We are not at a stage when
we can say, yes, this is going to
be a good year. These are not
applications. I can talk to a
million people on the road, but if
only 100 apply then it doesn’t do
us much good,” cautioned Ross,
a former student body presi-
dent.

‘*A lot of people mentioned co-
education and also the U:S.
News and World Report arti-
cle,” he added.

Male students did not talk that
much about coeducation, Ross
said. Their questions about
coeducation mainly concerned
how it will affect their chances of
getting accepted.

“The women had a tremen-
dous amount of information
about W&L,”’ Ross said.

Ross said the prospective
female students were concerned
with the atmosphere for the first
women on campus. Many of the
women had heard of student and
alumni opposition to coeduca-
tion, he added.

“T always stress to them to
visit the campus,’’ Ross said “‘I
think that most of the women

that have come to the campus
have been reassured. I think the

 

Coeducation:

83

What Will It Mean?

 

 

adjustment here is going to be
really easy compared to other
schools.”

Ross said he did not hear any
negative reactions to coeduca-
tion from male students.

‘*No one has said, ‘Gee, I wish
you would have stayed all-male
because I really wanted to go to
an all-male college,’ ” Ross add-
ed

Ross said some prospective
students he talked to also seem-
ed to have been attracted to
W&L by the favorable magazine
article.

“There’s no question that that
kind of publicity helped us,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’ve sent out reprints of
that article to prospective
students. We figure we can get
about two more years’ mileage
out of that article.”

Ross said that in general he
found a great demand for a
small, coeducational, liberal
arts college in the South, and
W&L was trying to meet that de-
mand.

“People appreciate the diver-
sity in the curriculum,’’ Ross
said. ‘‘They can get the advan-
tages of a small school, but still
get the programs of a larger
school.’’

Ross said he has been encour-
aging students to apply to W&L
even if they think their chances
of being accepted are slim.

“‘We might get into a situation
where people think that they
might not be able to get into the
school because it would be so
competitive,’’ warned Ross.

The deadline for applications
for early admission is Dec. 1. In
an average year W&L receives
90-100 early admissions applica-
tions.

Feb. 1 is the deadline for all
applications for admission. A-
bout 1,600 students usually apply
each year.

Meanwhile, admissions office
personne] will continue to travel
around the country. Ross said
representatives of the admis-
sions office will visit more than
600 secondary schools in 37
states.

Honor

OC) Continued from Page 1

Students were not free to wander in and out
when they pleased, as they may do during a Lee
Chapel honor trial. Most of the dissemination of
information about the trial would have to come
from the few who attended and from the campus
newspapers.

Thus, although the trial was not ‘‘open”’ in the
sense that W&L’s are, it was more ‘‘open’’ than
W&L’s because of the media coverage.

The reasons for Miss Fawcett’s decision to seek
an open trial are not clear. Several Honor Com-
mittee members said that perhaps she merely
wished to reveal the inner workings of the U.Va.
honor system at a time when it — and many other
systems, including our own — is under intense
scrutiny.

Had Miss Fawcett been accused of an honor
violation at W&L, though, Sunday’s trial would
have been closed, no matter what her wishes.
Had she been convicted in a closed trial here, her
only appeal would be an open trial.

In Charlottesville, if she had chosen to have a
closed first trial, it would have followed the same
procedures, with the same jury makeup, as Sun-
day’s trial. In addition, if she were convicted and
wished to appeal, her appeal also could be closed.

A U.Va. student convicted of an honor offense is
allowed to appeal only for ‘‘good cause” — if an
error in procedure has been made in the original
trial — or if there is new evidence that, if in-
troduced in the original trial, would have resulted
in acquittal.

The student body Executive Committee is the
jury for a student’s first trial at W&L. At U.Va.,
whether the trial is open or closed, the jury con-
sists of four Honor Committee members and
eight students selected by the counselors from a
random list of 75.

The makeup of a jury for an appeal at U.Va.
would be similar to that of an original trial, while
at W&L the jury for an open trial consists entirely

     

 

tes eee eo eeeeeteeeee

of randomly selected students.

In many respects, Sunday’s trial was similar to
a W&L hearing except that it was much shorter
than most W&L open trials. The actual testimony
lasted only about 5% hours. The jury spent
3% hours during the lunch recess developing
questions for the witnesses who had testified in
the morning session and another three hours
deliberating on the verdict.

The trial proceeded smoothly, with few delays,
and most witnesses were ready to testify when
their turn came and few objections were raised
by the counselors.

At least four-fifths — 10 members — of the jury
had to vote ‘‘guilty’’ for Miss Fawcett to be con-
victed. At W&L, only eight members — two-thirds
— of the jury have to vote ‘‘guilty’”’ for a student
to be convicted.

The scene was reminiscent of many a W&L
honor trial as the crowd outside the Honor Com-
mittee room nervously anticipated the jury’s ver-
dict. Chatting in small groups, napping and mak-
ing some attempts to study, they also exchanged
small talk about the outcome. —

Finally, at 9:15 p.m., more than 12 hours after
the trial had begun, an Honor Committee official
emerged from the trial room to announce that the
jury had reached a verdict.

Miss Fawcett, her parents and her counselors
returned to the trial room. They were closely
followed by the public and the media pushing
their way into the room for the few moments of
this short — but agonizing — session.

Sitting in front of a bust of Thomas Jefferson -

and flanked by the 11 other students who had
made the fateful decision, Blue read the jury’s
guilty verdict.

Miss Fawcett stared forward in seeming
disbelief, then slowly rose from her chair. She put
her arms around her boyfriend, laid her head on
his shoulder and began to cry.

Silently filing out of the trial room, the
observers realized that they had participated ina
process — the essentials of which are the same on
the Grounds as on the Colonnade— that results in
a high degree of trust toward and among Univer-
sity of Virginia and Washington and Lee students.

A question of Honor

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

CHARLOTTESVILLE — The
facts of Sunday’s honor case at
the University of Virginia were
similar to those of an open trial
held at Washington and Lee in
the fall of 1982: a student was ac-
cused of resubmitting a test for
academic credit after markings
had been made on the paper in
an attempt to mislead the pro-
fessor.

The Math 122 — Calculus II
—test of Monique R. Fawcett
which was entered into evidence
showed a grade of 85 out of 100,
whereas mathematics instructor
Steven R. Edwards had record-
ed a score of 62 for the test.

Miss Fawcett had returned the |

test to a teacher’s assistant,
claiming that the score of 85
should, in fact, have been only
82. The accusers said that claim
was merely a ruse to get a “‘B”’
grade recorded for the paper
after the higher scores had been
forged on it. Miss Fawcett’s
counsel claimed she had nothing
to do with the suspicious
regrading.

The instructor testified that
when the test was returned to
him for re-evaluation, he im-
mediately noticed the score was
not in his handwriting and that
some of the marks on the paper
had been “‘badly scribbled out or
erased.”

An examination of the test fol-
lowing the jury’s verdict showed
that some of the markings on the
test had been carelessly scratch-
ed out, a dark felt pen had been
used to trace over some of the
numbers until the ink bled
through to the back of the page,
and erasure had been attempted
on some of the original markings

to the point that there was a hole
in the paper.

In accordance with U.Va. hon-
or system procedure, Edwards
invited another student to
review the test after the teacher
became suspicious. “‘I was sure
it had been tampered with,”’ said
Nelson A. Nieves, one of the two
students who formally accused
Miss. Fawcett. ‘‘There were ob-
viously problems and alterations
with Miss Fawcett’s test.”

Miss Fawcett, who said she
plans a career in oceanography,
testified that she was a ‘‘very
average’ student and that she
was ‘‘not super-impressed”’ with
Edwards’ teaching. She said she
found the marks on the test con-
fusing and had returned the
paper to have them clarified.

“I wanted to know if the grade
should have been higher or
lower,’’ she told the jury. ‘‘When
I first received the test, it did not
look tampered with — it just
looked like sloppy grading.”’

A math department teaching
assistant who had scored a por-
tion of Miss Fawcett’s examina-
tion testified that it was ‘‘not
unusual’ for mistakes to be
made in grading or for students
to request a review of a paper’s
grade.

“Mr. Edwards graded a test,
put a 62 on it, and it had that
grade when it left the math de-
partment,” said Christopher
Hockett, an advocate for the ac-
cusors. ‘‘The test was altered
when it was under Miss Faw-
cett’s control, and she knew it
had been tampered with when
she resubmitted it to the math
department....

“That was a willful, mis-
leading and, I might add,
reprehensible concealment of
the truth.”’

‘The Bear’ struggles
for a passing grade

of scenes. Overall I would say

 

ae his performance was good, but I
think he came on a little strong,
occasionally, when speaking

One of the problems many of about football. From the first
us have when we see a movie is __ time he goes out with his future
that we go into the theater ex- wife, he talks about football in
pecting one thing and get an- ‘‘coach-like” ways. At that

other. This was exactly what
happened to me when I saw
“The Bear,” a film based on the
life of Paul “Bear” Bryant,
which opened at the State in Lex-
ington and across the country
last Friday.

I had hoped ‘‘The Bear”’ would
deal with Paul Bryant, the man,
not simply ‘‘Bear’’ Bryant, the
coach. What I finally realized,
about three-fourths of the way
through the movie, was that, in
the minds of writer Michael
Kane and director Richard C.
Sarafian, there was no way to
separate this man from this
coach.

Gary Busey plays Bryant; it is
his show to make or break as he
is on-screen in all but a handful

point, it seemed inappropriate;
however, when he stands in front
of his teams and tells them
to “hit somebody, help ‘im up,
and tell ‘im you'll be right
back,” Busey is at his best.
Again it is hard to separate this
coach from this man.

There are also some fine se-
quences in “The Bear.” The
training sequences with the
Texas A&M Aggies and Busey’s
reaction to his team when he
first returns as coach of Ala-
bama stand out. This film will
not win an Oscar as Best Pic-
ture, but it is not a bad film
either. It is a must for Bryant
fans; others, however, might
feel that ‘‘The Bear’’ fumbles
the ball just shy of the goal line.

Duck group wings onto campus

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Mention anything regarding
waterfowl on this campus and
one immediately thinks of
favorite Washington and Lee ex-
pressions such as “‘that guy is
such a goose,”’ or “he’s really
goosing out.’’ So when an organ-
izational meeting for a group
called Ducks Unlimited was held
Monday night, an investigation
seemed in order. To clear the
air, D.U. does not hunt, trap,
skin, protect, breed or have
anything to do with the ‘“‘feath-
ered’’ members of the W&L
community.

Founded in 1937, the purpose
behind D.U. is to help restore
and rehabilitate prime water-
fowl breeding grounds in Cana-
da, where over 70 percent of
North America’s waterfowl are
hatched. This plan began be-
cause of the loss of almost all
such lands during the 1930’s dust
bowl era. To date, over 2,400
restoration projects of wetlands
and breeding areas have been

 

completed.

The Tuesday meeting lasted
well over two hours, with a
movie narrated by John Wayne
showing the various rehabi-
litated areas in Canada. The pur-
pose was to establish an organ-
izational committee to oversee
the sportsman’s banquet, the
main source of income for the in-
dividual chapters.

Dick Francis, regional direc-
tor of D.U. for West Virginia and
western Virginia, brought vari-
ous brochures, pamphlets and
advice to show the enthusiastic
group of about 10. Francis re-
tired as chief of the Ohio Divi-
sion of Wildlife after 30 years
with that organization.

As the main source of income
for the individual chapters, the
sportsman’s banquet is quite a
show. Limited edition prints and
decoys, as well as DU’s “‘gun of
the year,” are only a few of the
items to be sold at auction or raf-
fled at the banquet. Ticket prices
have not yet been determined,
but the tentative date for the din-
ner and auction is Nov. 13.

The chairman for the new
chapter here in Lexington is
Eric Obeck, a junior from
Hampton. His family has been
active in D.U. for many years
and his mother was once D.U.’s
artist of the year. Obeck said he
called Andy Crowel, state chair-
man for D.U., who ‘‘really seem-
ed enthusiastic about a chapter
in Lexington.’’ The committee
decided to call the new chapter
‘Rockbridge County Ducks Un-
limited.”” Obeck added he would
“like to open the club up to the
community, especially those as-
sociated with Washington and
Lee.”’

“For people who don’t really
know anything about D.U. ban-
quets, I encourage them to at-
tend or ask their friends about
it,”” said Obeck, who has attend-
ed several of the events.

In buying a ticket for the ban-
quet, one automatically be-
comes a member of D.U. This
entitles the member to decals,
the D.U. magazine and other
items.

Parties, not horses,
draw Foxfield crowd

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — A
small crowd was on hand for the
Washington and Lee home foot-
ball game Saturday against
Randolph-Macon.

Although the day was dreary
and drizzly, the weather wasn’t
the culprit.

The reason for the low atten-
dance could be found here, 75
miles to the northeast, where the
Foxfield Races attracted nume-
rous W&L students and their
dates for one of the largest par-
ties this side of Fancy Dress.

Although the primary reason
for Foxfield is horse racing,
most students who went said
they didn’t pay much attention
to the horses. But that didn’t
seem to matter.

At least five W&L fraternities
went as groups to the biennial
event and rented party space in
the infield. Many other students
made the road trip in smaller
groups or as individuals.

“‘Even the weather and an oc-
casional horse didn’t interrupt
the party,” freshman Jon Solo-
mon said. “I can see a definite
possibility of limiting Rush to a
one-day activity if it were as

good a party as Foxfield.’’

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent David Perdue called Fox-
field ‘the hugest outdoor party
I’ve ever been to, and we never
saw a horse, but we had a great
time.”

Freshman Steve Szczecinski
said it was ‘‘the biggest gather-
ing for eating, drinking and mer-
riment that I’ve ever been to. . .
and I saw a horse.’”’ Another
freshman, Jeff Lowell, said he
did notice a couple of the horse
races, which he called ‘‘good,”
but that ‘‘it seemed like a big ex-
cuse to party.”

When he thinks of Foxfield,
senior Jeff Blount said, ‘‘I just
think of a wild, colorful after-
noon of eating, drinking and lots
of fun.”

Students from other schools
also were in abundance, al-
though many University of Vir-
ginia students had made a trek
in the opposite direction to
Blacksburg for the Cavaliers’
football game against Virginia
Tech.

“It was a good chance for
students from a lot of schools to
get together,”’ said one sopho-
more. ‘‘No, we didn’t see a lot of
horses — we didn’t really care
that much about it.”’

If the Washington and Lee
faculty follows its Executive
Committee’s recommendations,
next year’s academic calendar
will retain the 12-12-6 format,
and classes will be lengthened to
55 minutes.

In a Monday meeting, the fac-
ulty EC considered the recom-
mendations of both the ad hoc
Calendar Committee and the
Committee on Registration and
Schedules, according to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John. All of
those recommendations were to
have been considered by the
University Council this after-
noon, and are scheduled to be
voted on by the entire faculty
Monday.

“The faculty was sent the
recommendations of the Calen-

 

dar Committee last spring,”
John said. Included in the pack-
age containing the calendar
committee’s recommendations
was a proposal for an alternative
calendar by Professor David G.
Elmes.

Appointed by University Pres-
ident John D. Wilson last fall, the
Calendar Committee completed
its work in the spring and
developed four recommenda-
tions: retaining the 12-12-6 calen-
dar, lengthening class periods to
55 minutes, replacing Thanks-
giving vacation with a one-week
break in October and reducing
paperwork resulting from the
present registration and
drop/add system.

was similar.

“There was discussion,’’ said
John, who noted ‘widespread
opposition’’ to eliminating
Thanksgiving break.

“T don’t really expect much
debate myself,’’ said chemistry
Professor John H. Wise, chair-
man of the calendar committee.

Describing himself as_ the
“convener” of the University
Council, John said a faculty co-
chairman and a student co-
chairman would be elected at to-
day’s meeting. This year’s 30-
member UC, composed of 13 stu-
dents, 12 faculty members and
five administrators, has not had
the opportunity to look at or
discuss the proposals as a group.

“Because of the timing, it
makes it a bit difficult.’”’ John
said. “I couldn’t do anything un-
til after the faculty EC
meeting.”

Tailgating adds to spirit of game

A new sidelight has been add-

ed to Washington and Lee foot-

ball games this fall: pre-game
parties sponsored by the Alumni
Association on the athletic fields
above Wilson Field.

The parties, put on with the
cooperation and support of sev-
eral campus organizations, in-
cluding the Interfraternity Coun-
cil and the Student Activities
Board, resemble ‘‘tailgate’’ par-
ties at larger universities.

Two such gatherings have
been held so far and, weather
permitting, they will continue
throughout the remainder of the
Generals’ home football sch-
edule. The purpose, Alumni As-
sociation Executive Secretary
Richard B. Sessoms said, is to
provide a place for the W&L
community to meet and have fun
before watching the football
game.

Both parties have been suc-
cessful, Sessoms said. The first
was put together rather hastily,
he added, but still managed to
draw a good number of students.
The second was less well attend-
ed, but Sessoms attributed that
problem to a conflict with the
popular Foxfield horse races.

However, Sessoms added that
the idea “‘hasn’t had a fair test
yet.”

The plan for the parties, Ses-
soms continued, is to have stu-
dents meet on the fields above
Wilson Field an hour or so before
the kickoff and to have a picnic
lunch and a party. The Alumni
Association arranges live enter-
tainment at the functions, and
many fraternities have
cooperated in the effort.

In addition to increasing sup-
port for the Generals at the
games, Sessoms said another ob-
ject of the parties is to attract
alumni to the campus. “It al-
ways makes us happy when
alumni come on campus for any

reason,” he added.

Cross country downs two foes to hit 4-0 mark

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Last Saturday the Washington
and Lee cross country team
picked up another two victories

to keep its record undefeated at °

4-0. The Generals defeated Nor-
folk State and last year’s Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Champions, Roanoke College.
The race was run on Roanoke
College’s 4.4-mile figure-eight
course. ‘‘The only problems with
the course were its eight hills
and large amounts of cow ma-
nure spread around,’’ David An-
drews said. Other members of
the team agreed that it was a

Devastating 30-9 first quarter
brings third W&L football loss

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

If you take away the opening
10 minutes of Saturday’s football
game between Washington and
Lee and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege of Ashland, the Generals
lost a hard-fought game by the
score of 19-9. Unfortunately for
W&L the first 10 minutes proved
to be much more important as
far as the outcome was concern-
ed than was the remainder of the
game.

Before the first quarter had
ended, Randolph-Macon scored
30 points against the Generals on
its way to a 49-9 victory. The win
was the first in Old Dominion
Athletic Conference competition

for the Yellow Jackets, whose |

overall record now stands at 3-1.
W&L (1-3) suffered its third con-
secutive loss and is 0-2 in the

 

short course but that the hills
made it a difficult one.

Frank Pittman won the race
for Washington and Lee in 26:22,
15 seconds ahead of second-place
finisher David Lindin (26:37) of
Roanoke. Eddie Goundry finish-

_ ed third (26:47) overall, and se-

cond for the Generals. Sixth and
seventh place went to Ted Myers
(27:11) and Andrews (27:12).
Roanoke placed five runners in
the top 12; Washington and Lee
placed eight and Norfolk State’s
first finisher was in 14th place in
28:33.

“We expected Norfolk to go
out fast,’’ Pittman said. ‘‘but

ODAC.

W&L could do no right during
the first quarter against R-M.
The Yellow Jackets recovered
two of their own kickoffs, con-
verting both into touchdowns. R-
MC quarterback Cody Dearing
had a hand in three of his team’s
four first-quarter touchdowns,
throwing a pair of scoring passes
(28 and 20 yards) to wide re-
ceiver Keith Gilliam, and runn-
ing three yards for the third.

Remon Smith also scored in the ©

first quarter for the Yellow
Jackets on a six-yard run. W&L
made matters worse for itself
when punter B.J. Sturgill was
tackled for a safety after the
snap had gone over his head into
the end zone, giving R-MC a 30-0
lead with 5 minutes remaining in
the first quarter.

In the second quarter, the

they were not a factor after the
first hill.”” That was quite clear
in the final score as the Generals
chalked up their second shutout
of the season, beating Norfolk
15-50.

Roanoke was a much closer
race; the Generals won by only
three points, 26-29. “It could
have gone either way between
Roanoke and W&L’”’ Andrews
said. ‘‘We quickly added up the
score at the end to check and see
if we won.”’

The Generals will travel to
Washington, D.C., this weekend
to run against American Univer-
sity and Catholic University at

‘Walter Alston-type managers are forgotten

 

TIME

By Mike
Stachura

 

 

 

 

....Picking up the papers on
Monday morning, I was irritated
to read that Joe Torre had been
relieved of his managerial duties
by Atlanta’s answer to Howard
Hughes, Ted (call me “ruth-
less”) Turner. The ax-murder-
ing of Torre coupled with the fall
of Rene Lachemann in Milwau-
kee proves once again the old
adage ‘“‘If all else fails, fire the
manager.”

No, I’m not a fan of Torre. My
concern here is with the baseball
owners and their underlings. As
the trend goes toward having
front office, stuffed-shirt types
running the show, handing out
managerial pink slips like they
were sO many Domino’s Wild
Wednesday coupons, the days of
Walter Alston-type managers
and George Halas-type coaches
are gone and, for all intents and
purposes, forgotten. And that
fact, friends, is an unfortunate

turn of events.

Granted, this blame-it-on-the-
manager trend may only be a
function of the times, where if
success is not maintained or im-
proved upon, one ends up sitting
in Bob Uecker’s seats. I also ac-
cept the fact that professionals
are paid to produce. (Hint:
“Professionals” includes the
gents wearing the helmets and

past. Talent did not produce the
same results and breaks did not
go their way.

No, let’s not jump on a coach
or manager for not having his
troops on top. This unhealthy at-
titude has begun to afflict col-
lege and high school athletics, as
well. Everybody’s got to win or
they’re not doing their job. No
one interviews the coach whose

caps.)

I think the problem lies in the
short-sightedness of those pen-
cil-necked geeks doing the hiring
and firing. Torre and Lache-
mann were fired not for poor
managing, but because they
didn’t win a sufficient number of
games. (Front office cannot see
a difference between these two,
but then this is to be expected.)

What it seems wasn’t looked at
was the simple fact that neither

The Generals’ soccer team is
very hard to predict so far this
season, but one thing is certain
and that is the fact that they
have started their 1984 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
season properly.

The team edged out rival
Maryville in a hard-fought con-
test by the score of 1-0 on Satur-
day and went on the road to Har-
risonburg and came away with a
3-2 overtime victory against

team went .500 on the year. The
simple truth is that this man or
woman works at least as hard as
the Joe who’s taken his team toa
fifth league title. Probably har-
der.

If we’re thinking of firing man-
agers, let’s fire them for being
bad managers (read: making
bad decisions, not having their
decisions go bad because of
something beyond their control).
Otherwise, let’s go back to our
big desks and make some deci-
sions that are within our right to

Eastern Mennonite.

The Generals now have a 3-3
record after dropping three of
their first four games. With the
week’s two wins against con-
ference foes, W&L’s ODAC mark
stands unblemished at 2-0.

In yesterday’s game against
Eastern Mennonite, the Gene-
rals got tallies from sophomore
Ken Randby and junior captain
Billy Holmes in regulation. The
winning goal in overtime came
from junior Eric Obeck.

All the Generals needed
against Maryville was a second-
half goal from Holmes, coming

If you’re listening, stuffed
shirts, let’s give coaches and
managers a chance to get estab-
lished. It’s tough to watch your
players and do your job when
you’re constantly looking over
your shoulder....

....Coming back to the Colon-
nade, a group worth your wat-
ching — as they’ll be making
headlines — is Coach Dick Mil-
ler‘s cross country team. The
harriers are off to a 4-0 start and
no one‘s been close yet. This
team has every intention of go-
ing far in 1984, and from this cor-
ner, the view is those intentions
are well-founded. ..It may sound
repetitious, but Page Remillard
has his troops on schedule again.
He seems to do it every year. No
doubt that polo will be there in
November. That 120-some miles
has been cut in half...

....G0od to see Nebraska
knocked off the No. 1 perch, too
many other good teams (truth
should shine through this week-
end in Stillwater, OK). Texas,
however, will not fall as easily.
Watch for its clash with Mus-

tangs of SMU, though....

...Referring back to my initial
thoughts, it was a wise action by
the stuffed shirts in Baltimore to
let Messrs. Ayala, Underwood,
Singleton and Bumbry know
there’d be no more free lunches.
Excess baggage has got to go,
but more importantly manage-
ment was able to recognize ex-
cess baggage. If players con-
sisteiitly don’t produce, find
players who do. (There’s only
one manager in the game who
can hit, field and throw. The rest
aren’t paid to do that.) There
can be no panic button in mana-
gement, contrary to what cur-
rent practices show us....

...Gerry Cooney beat a no-
body decisively. Does it mean
anything? Yes. It means Gerry
Cooney beat a nobody decisive-
ly. That’s all, he’s still a nothing,
but a fourth-round KO means he

. can still throw leather. Getting

people to walk into it may be
another story...

....Finally, rumors are that
football is becoming boring.

les-Redskins dance-off and bor-
ing won’t even begin to describe
what’s going on..’.

two ODAC matches

12 minutes into the half.

Sophomore Jim Tucker had an
outstanding game at sweeper
and was named player of the
game.

' “It was not a pretty win, but it
was a win and we'll take it,”’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian on
Saturday morning’s victory.
“Everyone is pleased tostart the
ODAC season with a win.”

Stastically, the Generals look
like a team much worse than
their 3-3 record would indicate.
The team has been - outscored
22-7 in its first five games,

although that statistic is bloated
by the Generals’ disastrous
opening weekend where they
were outscored 16-1. Since then,
scoring has been even at 6-6.
Another interesting stat is that
the Generals are 2-0 within the
friendly confines of Wilson
Field, but are 1-3 on the road.
Eight players have played a part
in W&L scoring so far.

The Generals are on the road
again Saturday when they travel
to Farmville to take on the
Tigers of Hampden-Sydney in
another ODAC matchup.

Remillard says polo
is now ‘on course’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

“‘We’re on course,”

Coach Page Remillard re-
acted by saying his team is ‘‘on
course”’ with his preseason goals
after viewing the Generals
second-place performance last
weekend at the Virginia State
Championships played in Cy
Twombly Pool.

“I’m pleased with the team’s
performance so far this year.
We’ve improved much faster
than last year’s team, but last
year’s team improved very
much at the end of the season—
when it counts,”’ Remillard said.

first game for W&L, ran nine
yards for a touchdown, cutting
the Yellow Jacket lead to 30-6.
W&L placekicker James White
added a 40-yard field goal later
in the quarter to make the half-
time score 30-9.

“In the second quarter, we
looked like the team that was
winning,” said W&L head coach
Gary Fallon. ‘‘We were the ag-
gressor, despite being behind by
30 points.”’

Any hope of a W&L comeback

was quickly put to rest in the.

third quarter when Dearing con-
nected with Gilliam for a 70-yard
touchdown pass. Gilliam finish-
ed the game with 118 yards in
receptions on three catches, all
of which were for scores.

R-MC added two more scores,
one later in the third quarter and
the last late in the fourth quart-
er, to make the final score 49-9.

Despite the lopsided score,
Fallon said that he thought his
team played “reasonably well.”

“Our special teams put us in a
deep hole right from the start,
but I don’t think we played that
badly,” Fallon said. ‘‘We did not
quit. We showed the old W&L
spirit and enthusiasm and we
kept on hitting until the game
ended.”

W&L must regroup quickly
this week if it is going to break
its three-game losing streak
against Maryville College in
Maryville, Tenn.

“We need a shot of confidence,
but it will not be easy to find it
this week,’’ Fallon said. ‘“‘Mary-
ville is a very capable football
team. They are big and have
already beaten a good Hamp-
den-Sydney team. The game
should be a real dog fight.”’

The Generals went through the
R-MC game injury-free. Tight
end Ian Banwell and linebacker
Bob Berlin will be back in the
line-up against Maryville.

“We will not cash in the
season,” Fallon said. ““‘We have
a lot of fiber and character on
this team and I am confident
that we will get back on the win-

sing track Pessanecen ese ++ STIG

ning track.”

The Generals placed second in
last weekend’s tournament be-
hind champion Richmond. Rich-
mond defeated W&L 14-8 in the
final game.

Before losing to Richmond, the
Generals (6-7-1) defeated Vir-
ginia (9-1), Virginia Com-
monwealth (9-2), and Hampden-
Sydney (18-5). The Generals’
fourth win of the tournament
was a 5-0 forfeit over no-show
James Madison.

Tim Stanford led the Generals
in scoring with seven goals last
weekend. Freshman Simon
Perez added five tallies for the
Generals’ cause.

Remillard evaluated team de-
fense as pretty good, but added
that team offense was “terrible”
last weekend. The Generals
scored only twice on nine man-
advantage situations (22.2 per-
cent). Remillard said that if his
team is going to be competitive
then they need to score on 70 per-
cent of their penalty plays.

Hoping to improve their of-
fense the Generals have spent
most of this week working on
controlling the ball and scoring
in man-advantage situations.

In the goal last weekend, soph-
omore Jeff Cohen, playing for
the injured Kevin Davidson, pro-
vided the Generals with six
quarters of shutout play in the
shallow end.

Davidson, who is suffering
from a compressed vertebra,

Sullivan and David Hall as first-
year men who are quickly pick-
ing up the game of water polo

team.

Concerning Perez, Remillard
said, “Simon has played really
well and has a bright future in
water polo.’

“Eric Sullivan is coming
along. He is adjusting well and
learning to discipline himself,”
added Remillard.

Remillard described Hall as a
player who works very hard and
“plays better in games than he
does in practice.”

will host the Southern League
