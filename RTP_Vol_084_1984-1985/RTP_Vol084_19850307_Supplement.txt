MY
VIEW

By Cole
Dawson

As other honor systems
crumble under legalistic pres-
sure or simply fade away due
to a lack of interest, we have
the unique opportunity to
strengthen our 120-year-old
tradition.

Monday through Wednes-
day, we will be able to vote on
a constitutional amendment
that will add an additional law
representative to the Execu-
tive Committee. This position
is long overdue and will serve
the entire undergraduate and
law campus in two very im-
portant ways.

First and most importantly,
it will give the EC added ex-
perience in honor-related mat-

ters and another possible ad-
vocate for open hearings. This
will facilitate the operation of
the Honor System University-
wide. Secondly, it will give
needed representation to the
second-year law class — a
class that has had no repre-
sentation in the past.

To pass, however, two-
thirds of one-half of the stu-
dent body must favor such a
change. Last year, this same
motion failed because one-half
of the student body did not
vote. It was, however, heavily
supported on the undergrad-
uate campus, as I hope it will
be again this year.

I urge everyone to exercise
their right to vote in both the
Big Three elections and on this
amendment. It will add
strength to our very tradition-
al University.

Cole Dawson is president of
the student body.

The election next week for the
Big Three offices of the Ex-
ecutive Committee may be at
the back recesses of most
students’ minds. The obvious
reason is its proximity to Fancy
Dress — a mind-blinding occa-
sion which takes place over the
next three days and tends to
linger on into next week. The
main reason for the lack of in-
terest, however, originates from
last week’s Phi editorial ‘‘E.C.:
No Comment’”’ on page two.
Many people either choose to be
or simply are more distant from
the business of the Executive
Committee. There is nothing
wrong with this, until it begins to
greatly affect the outcome of the
elections, just because students
with a valid opinion don’t bother
to vote.

By Darby

In my opinion, the purpose of
the editorial was not to totally
abuse the present Executive
Committee or to discourage
students from caring or believ-
ing in the future role of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. I think the
stern overview of this year’s
committee was meant to startle
students who are not as well in-
formed about our student gov-
ernment’s affairs. (The author
also wished to motivate a com-
mittee which he felt has been
somewhat dormant, but the ex-
planation of this is not my pur-
pose.) It is no secret that with
the first year of coeducation,
there will be added controversy
and a more diversified com-
munity over which the executive
Committee must govern. Thus it
is more important in this elec-
tion than any other in our recent
past, that we consider the can-
didates not just for their popular
names and characters, but also
for their realistic leadership
abilities. Ask yourself if these
potential leaders have the
motivation to tackle successfully
those problems which our com-

munity will face. If you don’t
know the candidate, inquire
about him. I do not question the
integrity of any student when it
comes to this decision-making
process, but it is too easy for a
student to vote for the name he
recognizes on the ballot.

The members of the Executive
Committee sacrifice a great deal
of time during the year, attemp-
ting as best as they can to uphold
the Honor Code and govern
effectively for the student body.
It takes very little sacrifice on
our part to make a knowledgable
choice in these elections. Don’t
allow students who cannot fully
handle the responsibility of these
offices to be elected. It can be a
waste of the Executive Commit-
tee’s time, as well as your own
since your legitimate expecta-

‘tions may not be reached.

Please note: Seniors and third-
year law students also vote on

EC balloting to begin Monday

Honor stressed at Big Three forum

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

The Honor System and its
ramifications were discussed by
candidates for Monday's Big
Three elections at a forum Tues-
day.

The forum drew about 20 stu-
dents to a Commerce School lec-
ture room as this year’s Execu-
tive Committee campaigns offi-
cially began. Candidates had
turned in their petitions Monday
night to the Voting Regulations
Board.

The first round of voting for
EC president, vice president and
secretary will be Monday, with
runoff elections scheduled for
next Thrusday.

Three of the five questions
asked the four presidential can-
didates by the audience dealt
specifically with the Honor Sys-
tem. The candidates, Patrick
Hayden, Lee Hollis, John Lewis
and James White, expressed the
following opinions on the Honor
System:

eHayden: ‘‘The Honor System
works well only out of the will-
ingness of the students to make
it work.... The faith that the
students have in the EC makes
the Honor System work well."’

“Of course, confidentiality is
the basis for the Honor System.
The only way to strengthen it is
tohave the EC enforce it.”

“The Fancy Dress theme is us-
ually a better-kept secret than
most honor violations.”’

*Hollis: He said he would like
to see ‘intensive orientation to
the Honor System when they
first get here. Unless it’s embed-
ded into their head like a rock,
there’s no way the system can
survive.”

Hollis recommended that, if
possible, orientation at Natural
Bridge be reinstated to give the
freshmen “one-on-one contact
rather thana lecture.”

“The confidentiality of the
Honor System is the key to it,”’
he said. ‘‘It should never be leak-
ed out that someone was brought
up for an investigation and it
was dropped.”’

eLewis: A student accused of
an honor violation should be
given 48 hours, not 24, to prepare
his case before the EC hearing,
and there should be a much
greater degree of confidentiali-
ty, Lewis argued.

‘I, John Lewis, member of the
student body, can find out about
too many cases,’’ he added. “I
think it’s vitally important that
the air of confidentiality remain
that way. If you have people
talking about it, you are not go-
ing togeta fair trial.”

On the topic of orientation,
Lewis suggested a less formal
approach to encourage respect
for, instead of fear of, the system
and ‘‘a more folksy ap-
proach...rather than a reign of
terror approach.”

eWhite: ‘‘There’s no real
gauge to measure the Honor Sys-
tem,”’ said White, adding that if
it is working, students can give

“IT think the orientation pro-
cess has been excellent,”’ White
said. “I really don’t see any
room for improvernent,’’ He said
he would try to utilize Law
School student leaders for first-
year orientation.

The problem with confidential-
ity is not entirely the EC's fault,
White said, but it is ‘‘a pressing
problem.”

“It plays a great part [in the
Honor System] and we have had
a problem with it this year,” he
said.

be based on honor, not ‘‘legal-
isms,’’ Hayden and Hollis spoke

proved, the upperclass represen-
tative — who now represents
both second- and third-year law
students — would be divided into
two positions, one for each class.
This would increase the EC
membership to 13.

In order for the amendment to
pass, two-thirds of the students
voting must vote in favor of it
and at least half of the student
body must vote.

A similar amendment propos-
ed last spring failed because not
enough students voted. Although
more than two-thirds supported
the amendment, 70 students
fewer than 50 percent cast
ballots.

The EC voted unanimously in
November to put the amend-
ment before the student body
again this year and has express-
ed support for the amendment.

“There seems to be a lot of
support for another law rep, and
there seems to be a feeling that
the second-year students do not
have a rep to turn to,” EC Presi-
eg Cole Dawson said in the
all.

The Election Supplement, March 7, 1985, Page 3

 

Black: Coed committee experience helpful

Michael Black says one of his
main objectives in running for
election is to ensure a smooth
transition to coeducation next
year.

“Being on the Coeducation
Steering Committee has really
helped me a lot in opening my
eyes to what problems might
arise next year, and there will be
problems,”’ said Black, also a
junior representative to the EC.

The coeducation committee
recently passed a resolution ask-
ing the EC to appoint a woman
ad hoc member to the Student
Control Committee if one is not
elected. Black said that resolu-
tion, which he helped pass, is the
kind of action needed to make
sure women are treated as fairly
as men next year.

Black compared the problems
that women might have next
year with the problems he sees
minorities as having now.

“People would assume that if
{the Student Association for
Black Unity] had a problem with
the EC they would speak up

Caruthers:

Sophomore Andrew Caru-
thers, an Executive Committee
member for the past two years,
says he has ‘‘matured greatly”
during his time in office and has
“a better sense and understand-
ing” of the needs of the student
body and the University.

“If I see a problem or some-
thing that should be working dif-
ferently, I’ll try to come up with
ideas for how it might work a lit-
tle better,”’ he said. He discussed
three projects to which he has
devoted special attention:

*Voting Regulations Board:
“For the past two years,

‘there’ve been complaints about

elections,” he said ‘‘There’s
always been a chairman of the
Voting Regulations Board, but
no board. I decided we should
have a board.”’

He worked this term to recruit
VRB members and last month
successfully argued that the
VRB, not the EC, should run
next week’s elections.

eIndependent Union: ‘I tried
to take a sineere, genuine inter-
est in getting the IU organized,
even though the EC, I think,
treated it poorly,” he said.

He said he attended several
meetings during the group’s
formative stages last year and
gave it suggestions for obtaining
EC funding, which it has done.
He said he’s pleased to see the
social and intramural events the
IU is now sponsoring.

*Student Bar Association:
“It’s important for us to walk
across the footbridge and actual-
ly show our faces over there,”’
said Caruthers, who is the EC’s
ad hoc representative to the
SBA,

Last year he was a vocal pro-
ponent of ‘‘fiscal autonomy’”’ for
the Law School’ and feels they
should have ‘‘their own reins.”’

about it, but that’s not the case,”
he said.

Minority students might be
hesitant to bring their problems
to an all-white committee they
feel cannot possibly understand
them, Black said, and the same
thing might happen with next
year’s women.

‘“‘Next year is really going to
make it or break it for women in
the University,” he added. “‘If it
is a bad transition, the sour af-
tertaste will persist for a few
years, and I don’t want that to
happen. I love this school.”’

Black said that keeping lines
of communication open between
the students and their govern-
ment — and opening them for
minority students and women
— is one of the reasons he is run-
ning.

As for the EC’s job of adminis-
tering the Honor System, Black
said he sees himself more as
leaning toward the accused “‘un-
til the evidence goes against
him.”

“I’m not out to get anybody,”’

 

 

ANDREW CARUTHERS

He added that by attending SBA
meetings he’s improved commu-
nication between law and under-
graduate students, and that
“each truly appreciates the im-
portance of the other.’’

Turning to other topics,
Caruthers said the student body
looks to the EC for stability. ‘‘I
think people are tired of reading
in the paper every week about
some proposed change or new
committee,” he said.

“People just want everything
left the way it is. The students
expect us to take up for them and
express their views when these
proposals come up.”’

“When a big thing comes up,
we can’t be arbitrary or act on
our own personal whims,’’ he
added.

Caruthers said he'd like to see
less polarization among frater-
nities and between fraternity
members and independents. ‘‘I
really hate to see disunity in the
student body,”’ he said.

“It’s very important to have
friends in other fraternities and
friends who aren’t in fraterni-

he said. ‘If there is any doubt
about the guilt or innocence of
the accused, I lean toward the
accused.”’

The fact that both honor con-
victions this year were unani-
mous verdicts is evidence of the
EC’s care in ensuring that inno-

‘Spunky’ has

ties,’ he said. He added that
regulations mandating one-
house parties ‘‘only promote dis-
unity.”

As a member of last year’s
EC, Caruthers voted twice to op-
posé coeducation, but he said
he’s now eager for its arrival.
“I’m excited about coeducation,
and I’m not saying that to kiss up
to anybody,” he said.

“Everyone who’s honest will
admit that now that it’s passed,
our diploma is going to be more
valuable since the standards are
higher,”’ he continued. ‘I’m glad
that all of us are going to be here
to ensure that it goes the right
way. We need tradition through
the transition — and I'd like to be
one of those people.”’

Caruthers said the EC’s ap-
proach to the Honor System is
frequently |§ misunderstood.
“Sometimes I get the impression
students feel like the EC is a
Gestapo committee,”’ he said.

“We realize what a serious
matter the Honor System is and
yet we are not overly zealous, as
we should not be,’’ he said. ‘‘A
lot of times people don’t unders-
tand the emotional stress we go

cent students aren’t convicted,
Black said.

The vice president’s major re-
sponsibility, though, is to over-
see the student body budget, and
Black said he is qualified to han-
dle that job.

“Last year, I owned and ran
my own business — the Campus
Linen Service,” he said. ‘‘Just
having to run a business’s books
I think makes me extremely
qualified for the budget part.’’

In addition, Black said, his en-
thusiasm and outgoing nature
will enable him to stay in contact
with the student organizations
that receive funds.

“If they had some problems,
they would know I was there and
I would help.”

Black said his involvement in
student activities — the Student
Activities Board, student re-
cruitment and the track team, in
addition to his EC work — will
help him understand the varied
interests of the organizations.

He said he would like to see an
EC next year that will involve it-

‘matured

through in these things. We don’t
enjoy our job when it concerns
honor.”

He said a ‘‘commonsensical
attitude” is important in honor
matters. ‘‘This student genera-
tion doesn’t want people who
take a roadsign to be dismissed
from the student body,”’ he said.

He said it is the “‘fine line’’ in-
volved in such cases that makes

 

self in any issue that affects the
student body, even if the issue
does not specifically involve the
EC.

He gave as a suggestion the
possibility of the EC’s buying
banners or arranging for some-
one to lead cheers at football
games to increase school spirit.

“I feel like, ‘Get in there and
— not get your finger in every
pie and get pie all over the walls
— but get involved and show
your interest.’ I think that is
something we have not done this
year.”

“This year the EC has been
‘silent supporters,’ and I want to
change that.”

A friendly, outgoing EC can
reduce the fear some students
might have for the EC, Black
said. ‘‘I want the student body to
not feel threatened.”’

He also hopes that breaking
down the barriers between the
students and the EC will keep
next year’s women from becom-
ing alienated.

him believe the EC “should
concentrate on academic mat-
ters’’ such as cheating.
Caruthers last year was nick-
named ‘‘Spunky”’ for the energy
and zeal he brings his projects
and for his willingness to offer
some comic relief at meetings.
He is an English major from
Shreveport, La., and was pledge
president of Phi Delta Theta.

White: Stability,
aggressiveness
crucial qualities

Stability, experience and ag-
gressiveness. Those are the big
three qualities Executive Com-
mittee Vice President James
White says he would provide as
student body president.

White, a two-year EC veteran,
said next year doesn't need to be
one of upheaval, in spite of the
move to coeducation. “I think
the student body doesn't want

any controversy,’ he said.
“They're tired of it.
He said having an experienced

EC president will be more im-
portant next year than most.
“With the first year of coeduca-
tion, it's crucial to have a good
start,” he said.

‘In the past, for the first half
of the year or so, the EC kind of
sputtered and had to get hands-
on experience as they served,"’
he continued. ‘‘Next year,
there's no time for that. Every-
thing's going to start right off the
bat.’

White said he tries to strike a
balance in his approach to lead-
ership. ‘I see myself as pretty
aggressive but level-headed at
the same time,” he said. “I can
see how some people might think
I've been too forceful about cer-
tain things, but I guess that’s
better than being too wimpy
about something.’

‘‘T like to run a tight ship,”’ he
said. “I think next year’s EC
would be run very authoritative-
ly, but I would never let that get
in the way of seeking outside stu-
dents’ opinions. I think you can
find a pretty good median.”

White said the decision for him
to try to move from the number-
two to the number-one EC posi-
tion was not automatic. ‘“‘I
thought about it for a long time,”’
he said.

“I hate it when someone de-
cides to do something and then
half-asses it,” he continued.
“You've got to follow through. If

you can't do that, you shouldn't
attempt to do it in the first
place."

White said one of the biggest
campus problems is administra-
tion regulation of fraternities.
“There is no single problem that
has plagued the students more
this year as far as campus life
goes,'' he asserted.

I think the EC is in a power
position and they need to utilize
that power to represent stu-
dents,"’ he said. ‘I think student
opinion now is that fraternities
are grossly over-regulated."’

‘‘We do need some regulations
— everybody does,” he added.
“I think students would like to
see these regulations come
through their own authority, like
the IFC."’

White, who was an outspoken
opponent of coeducation, said he
trusts the judgment of the trus-
tees and thinks ‘ ‘‘coeducation is
going to be a positive thing at
W&L.”

“This is such a sticky ques-
tion,”’ he admitted. ‘‘I guess the
trustees saw that they needed to
keep up with the times and
evolve like everybody else has.”’

“‘T think it’s going to add a new
dimension to W&L it hasn’t seen
before,” he said. ‘‘They're going
to be very sensitive to their
rights and how they're perceived
on campus. I think the EC needs
to take the initiative in seeing
that these girls are assimilated
into our community efficiently.”

The primary responsibility of
the EC vice president is monitor-
ing student body funds.

“I’m really proud of the fact
that this year has gone so well
financially,’’ White said. ‘The
fact that we've run a tight ship
directly influenced the fact that
we didn’t have to raise the stu-
dent tax for next year and had
more money to allocate this
term.”’

JAMES WHITE

White said the EC this year
has been “incredibly efficient’’
in handling honor matters. ‘‘It's
hard to gauge the Honor System,
but if there is an indicator it's
our convictions,’ he said.
“We've had two convictions and
nobody's gone to an open hear-
ing."

EC members should take ‘‘a
realistic view" of the Honor Sys-
tem, White said. For example,
he said some offenses are more
in the ‘‘prankster-like category”
than they are genuine honor of-
fenses.

White reflected on the scrutiny
given student leaders. ‘‘You’re
up to everyone's judgment,” he
said. “Everyone is judging you, —
which can be stressful, I guess.

“You just have to focus on the
big picture, and hope that when
the dust settles people will think
you've done a good job. If you
were doing it just for the pres-
tige, it wouldn’t be worth it.
There are too many hours in-
volved.”’

‘‘When you’re EC president, it
kind of becomes your life at the
time,” he said. ‘“You've got to be
incredibly committed to the job.
It’s easy when you're in there to
start taking things personally
and lose sight of what students
want.”

White has been a kicker on the
football team all three of his
years here. ‘Football is great,
especially at W&L,”’ he said. “It
gives people who aren’t Division
I athletes the chance to play.”

‘It helps you off the field,’
too,” he added.’ ‘‘My grades are
consistently highter during foot-
ball season. It gives you more re-

sponsibility.’

White is an administration
major from Dallas who is a
member of Phi Delta Theta.

 

 

Hayden: Familiarity
with honor important

Junior Patrick Hayden says
his experience distinguishes him
from his opposition for Execu-
tive Committee president.

As a representative to the EC
this year, Hayden has served on
the budget subcommittee, the
White Book Revisions Commit-
tee and the Voting Regulations
Board revisions committee.

“These go to the heart of the
EC’s jobs, and I think I’m pretty
much experienced in these
areas,” Hayden said.

“When the main job of the EC
is administering the Honor Sys-
tem, it’s very helpful to have so-
meone who's familiar with it.””

Another thing that distinguish-
es him from other candidates,
Hayden said, is that he does not
belong toa fraternity.

“T think I can be a little more
objective in that particular
aspect of the job because I don’t
have a vested interest in any one
fraternity,”’ he added. ‘‘I can do
what's best for fraternities over-
an

Administering the Honor Sys-
tem is the EC’s most important
responsibility, Hayden said, and
the system does work, although
students often don’t see it in ac-
tion.

“There have been almost as
many investigations already this
year as there were all of last
year. Maybe that’s because the
student body feels more confi-
dent letting the EC look into
something they consider dishon-
orable,”’ he added.

The Honor System, Hayden
said, ‘keeps it a more friendly
University. I doubt it could work
like this on a much larger
scale.”

This year’s freshman orienta-
tion to the Honor System was
held at Liberty Hall. Although
Hayden said this was a good
idea, “‘you still have problems
with freshmen not really under-
standing when they sign those
cards in the first week.”’

Hayden said he would estab-
lish a formal program with
dormitory counselors so that

they can better help their fresh-
men understand the Honor Sys-
tem.

Describing himself as a “‘fis-
cal conservative,’’ Hayden said
he has several criteria he would
require student body organiza-
tions to meet before getting
money from the EC.

“Any organization that gets
money should be potentially
open to any student,”’ he said.
“The person asking for the
money should be able to give
some documentation of interest
and if there’s going to be enough
students to make it worthwhile.
If there are only 10 guys involv-
ed, I can’t justify giving an or-
ganization $1,000.”

Several weeks ago, Hayden
voted against giving the Hockey
Club an extra $220 (‘‘It seems
like they were getting more than
their fair share back of the stu-
dent taxes.’’)} and donating $100
to the Muscular Dystrophy Su-
perdance. (‘Student taxes are
meant for student organizations.
I don’t think I should tell some-
body to give their money to char-
ity. They can do that if they want
0,"’)

With the arrival of the first
female students in the fall, Hay-
den said, an important job of the
EC will be to ensure fairness to
all students.

Although a female ad hoc
member on the Student Control
Committee would help toward
that end, he said, one on the Exe-
cutive Committee probably
wouldn’t be necessary.

“Apparently there hasn’t been
any problem in the past with the
EC being all-male and being ob-
jective about it,” he said.

Hayden is a politics and his-
tory major from Rochester,
N.Y. In addition to his EC work,
he is chairman of the College Re-
publicans and was assistant sec-

retary for the 1984 Mock Conven-
tion.

Lewis: Student body needs a spokesman

Junior John Lewis says the
student body has lacked an
effective spokesman in recent
years and hopes to have the
chance to rectify that shortfall.

“I’m going to speak the mind
of the students, whether it’s pop-
ular with the administration or
not,” he said. ‘‘What I feel is the
pulse of the student body is what
I’m going to give to people who
request that view.”’

Lewis said an example of the
message he'd like to convey is
that ‘fraternities are liked here
and are a good thing.”’

“Tell people who complain
about the fraternities to look
elsewhere before tiey criticize
us,”’ he said. ‘‘I think before they
smash the fraternities they
should think about what type of
students would be attracted to a
school with absolutely no social
life at all.”

““W&L has always prided itself
on the full man,”’ he added.
“Wisdom without character is

nothing ‘‘

Lewis said that with the ad-
vent of coeducation, women
should be welcomed but not cod-
dled.

“Since it was handed tous asa
fait accompli, I think for the
good of the University and the
progressive spirit, the student
body should stand behind it and
make the very best of it,” he
said.

“I’m having a terrible pro-
blem with this ‘boys will be boys
and girls will be girls’ attitude,”’
he added. “I think honor is some-
thing that, male or female, is
characterized by the same ac-
tions.”’

“‘W&L has a real honor code
and women can fit into that
beautifully,’ he continued. “It
should treat women exactly the
same as it treats men. That’s
what women want these days,
and I think W&L with its new
progressive attitude should do
that.”

 

 

JOHN LEWIS

Lewis said equality should al-
so characterize committee ap-
pointments. ‘“To give token posi-
tions, to have affirmative action
programs, is not what W&L
should do,” he said.

Hollis: has ‘ground floor’

Junior Lee Hollis says that
since he’s ‘been on the ground
floor’”’ of coeducation plans, he’s
a logical person to lead the stu-
dent body that change next year.

“I’m surprised the EC hasn’t
been involved in it this year,”’
said Hollis, who is chairman of
the fraternity affairs subcom-
mittee of the coeducation com-
mittee. ‘‘I figured they’d want to
takea little more active role.”

‘“‘When the EC. gets
recommendations plopped in its
lap, it’s going to need to know
whether they came from and un-
derstand them,” he said.

“The biggest thing the EC can
do with regard to easing the
transition to coeducation is to
wing it,” he said. ““You can’t an-
ticipate all the problems that
may come up. You have to try to
alleviate the problems when
they come up or before they
come up.”

Hollis said he supports the
recommendation that a woman
ad hoc member be appointed to
the Student Control Committee,
and added that he would favor
similar representation for black
students.

“T think it sets a precedent for
that type of action,” he said. ‘‘I
don’t know if it’s likely or not. I
don’t know how they feel they’re
being represented. My guess
would be that they don’t’ feel
they’re being adequately
represented. “If I were in their
shoes, I probably would’’ re-
quest such representation, he
added.

Hollis said he was originally
against coeducation, but that he
has no bad feelings about it now.
“There’s no need to hold a
grudge. From the beginning, I
didn’t have any qualms about
the idea of coeducation in gener-
al.”

His objection, he said, was
centered around tradition. ‘Now
that it’s here, there are certain
traditions that might be lost next

year,”’ he said. As an example,
he cited Robert E. Lee’s idea of
honorable behavior being simply
behavior becoming of a gentle-
man.

Hollis said his subcommittee
has found that ‘‘we don’t have to
accept the fact that we're going
to lose some fraternities under
coeducation.”’

“We're trying to get financial
data that shows a fraternity of 30
can survive and thrive,”’ he said.
“Although it looks probable that
you’re going to lose a few, it
doesn’t have to happen.”

Hollis said this year’s EC ‘“‘has
done a lot for the Honor Sys-
tem,’’ and he said he’d like to
continue that trend. ‘‘The impor-
tant thing to me is raising
awareness of the Honor Sys-
tem,” hesaid.

Hollis said some students have
misunderstood the administra-
tion position on fraternities.
“From what I’ve seen of the ad-
ministration, and I’ve been ex-

“If women get elected, that’s
what we want, but women should
not just be put there. That will
cause resentment among men.”

Lewis was unhesitating in his
assessment of the current state
of the Honor System. ‘‘The honor
code at Washington and Lee
works,”’ he said. “If I didn’t
think it worked well, I wouldn't
run for head of it.”’

Lewis is impatient with con-
stant discussion about loopholes
in the Honor System. ‘‘For me,
it’s so simple,” he said. ‘‘To act
honorably encompasses all the
technicalities. If you have honor-
able men, you don’t need the
technicalities. You have the reg-
ulations to nail those that are
dishonorable.”

The fraternities should be
among next year’s EC agenda
items, Lewis said.

“Fraternities are an example.
I hate to keep bringing that up,
but it’s true. Nobody is looking
out for them.”

Lewis said that as a dorm
counselor this year, he has
learned that W&L “‘selects real-
ly good men.”’

“‘] think that’s something that
in many cases the faculty and
administration fail to put their
finger on,”’ he said. ‘‘They see it
as a bunch of little boys running
out and joining fraternities.
Many of them are very responsi-
ble and much more mature than
they come across on Friday
night ata party.”’

Lewis said the fact that his
brother was a ‘‘seven-year
man” is helpful to him in under-
standing law students’ perspec-
tives on campus issues. ‘‘I also
have friends at the Law School
who give me good advice and
keep me in touch with their con-
cerns,”’ he said.

Greenville, near Staunton. He is
a past president of Phi Kappa
Psi, serves on Contact and is a
member of Kathekon.

posed to a lot of it this year,
there’s no vendetta against the
fraternities,’ he asserted.

“What the administration
wants is for the fraternities to
alter their ways a little bit.... and
to run themselves a little more
efficiently.”

“I hope we'll come up with
some ways to fix the problems
ourselves before the administra-
tion lays down the law,” he add-
ed. ‘‘Coeducation is a golden op-
portunity for the IFC to take the
bull by the horns and go ahead
and doa few things.”’

Hollis said he supports an ad-
ditional Law School EC repre-
sentative (‘‘they’re as much a
part of the University as anyone
else’) and a second freshman
EC member (’’there’s no reason
two of them can’t learn like the
one does now’’).

Hollis is a European history
major from Memphis. He is the
vice president of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon and is a member of

Best: EC
must aid
transition

Junior Steve Best foresees an
uneasy passage into coeduca-
tion, but says the Executive
Committee can help ‘“‘facilitate
the transition.”

“In three or four years, the
problem won't exist,’’ he said.
“For the first couple of years,
there’s going to be less than an
amiable atmosphere with the
girls. This can be predicted
— almost assured — just be-
cause the students were against
it and the teachers were for it.”’

“At W&L, it’s hard enough as
it is to succeed academically and
socially without being put down
by some spiteful males,’ he
said. ‘‘Our concern is that we try
to keep this to as much a mini-
mum as possible.”’

Best said that while ‘‘you have
to be fair to them — they’re
Washington and Lee students
now,” there will be a ‘general
bad feeling’’ if there are rules
“that we have to have a woman’’
in any particular organization.

“IT don’t believe in maintaining
quotas at all,”’ he said. ‘I don’t
believe a lesser person should be
put into a position that could be
held by a more qualified student
just because of race, creed or
sex.”’

Best said because the EC has
the ‘‘final say”’ in all matters, it
will have an influence on the
transition even though there is a
coeducation committee. ‘‘The
EC can take it upon themselves
to do something if someone
comes up to them with an idea,”
he said. ‘‘They don’t have to wait
until somebody on a subcommit-
tee thinks of it.”’

Best said the EC also can be
helpful to fraternities next year.
“The fraternity system at W&L
is integral to the community,”
he said. ‘‘The EC should treat it
as such. The EC should be

  

 

STEVE BEST

involved with everything that’s
important at W&L.”

Best said that in spite of the
campus changes in the last year,
the Honor System remains in-
tact. “I’ve been to different
schools, like J.M.U. and U.Va.,
and I’ve been amazed at the
amount of cheating,” he said. He
views the degree of student hon-
esty here, on the other hand, as
“absolutely fantastic.”

“Granted, you’re going to get
a couple of cases where students
want to take the short way out
and cheat instead of studying,”’
he added.

“I’m a stickler about being a
gentleman and being honorable,
but I also don’t see things in
black and white,’’ he said.

Best, a politics major from
Arlington, is the secretary of the
coeducation subcommittee on
student organizations and is the
incoming rush chairman of Pi
Kappa Alpha. He was vice presi-
dent of his freshman class and
was a member of the Student
Control Committee and_ this
year’s Who’s Who selection com-
mittee.

Best has worked on Capitol
Hill for the last six summers. He
plans to attend law school and
then become a trial lawyer. ‘I’m
not the kind of guy who’s going to
be a tax lawyer and sit behind a
desk,’’ he said.

He said if he loses his bid for
secretary, he plans to run for
senior EC representative or vice
president of the Commerce
School.

Webb: Communication key

Although sophomore Mike
Webb is a minority student, he
hopes other students will per-
ceive him just as one of them.

“Pm not just running as a
black student,”’ Webb said. ‘‘I’m
running as a Washington and
Lee student, and I want the stu-
dents to perceive me that way.
I’m pretty much doing this be-
cause I’m interested in what’s
going on in this University.”’

Even so, Webb said, there is a
role for a black student on the
Executive Committee, particu-
larly in the administration of the
Honor System.

‘*A lot of minority students feel
that because there isn’t a quote-
unquote ‘brother’ up there, going
up against an all-white executive
board nullifies their chances of
getting acquitted or whatever,”
Webb said.

The EC must make an effort to
let students, especially minor-
ities, ‘know that they’re not out
to get them,” Webb said.

‘“} don’t think the EC’s out to
get people. If you are an honor-
able student, then you really
shouldn’t have any fears of the
EC.”

Any racism that does exist at
Washington and Lee is at least
partly overexaggerated, Webb
said.

“I don’t see the racial problem
too much at Washington and
Lee,” he added. ‘‘I think that it’s
partly paranoid...If something

LeClerca:

Junior dorm counselor Ted Le-
Clercq said this week that ad-
ministration of the Honor Sys-
tem is the most important job of
the Executive Committee and
that he would be able to give any
student a fair hearing.

“] think the best thing about
the Honor System is that the stu-
dents interpret where they go in
terms of specific violations,’’ Le-
Clereq said. ‘‘I think that pre-
vents something that the student
body as a whole might not agree
with.”

“T care very much about how
the Honor Code here at W&L is
enforced, and I’m interested in
participating in the EC,” he con-
tinued. “‘I think it’s important to
use just good common sense.”

Next year’s EC will have to

ease the transition to coeduca-

happens there are cries of ra-
cism.”’

Webb defined his campaign
theme as better communication
between the Executive Commit-
tee and the student body.

“A lot of students know who
the EC members are, but some-
times the EC members don’t
know who the students are,”
Webb said. ‘‘The key to any good
government is communication.
As long as people know what’s
going on, you can’t go wrong.”’

Communication is going to be
particularly important next year
with the arrival of the first
female undergraduates, Webb
added.

“‘T think that if we make initial
contact with the women stu-
dents, then they’ll feel that they
are a part of the community and
that if they have any problems
they can come to you,’’ Webb
said. “If the EC and other large
campus organizations don’t ex-
tend their hands first, I think
there’s going to be unnecessary
tension.”’

Appointing women ad _ hoc
members to the Student Control
Committee and the Executive
Committee if none is elected in
the fall also would help ease the
transition to coeducation, Webb
said.

“Tt will be a — and I hate to
use the word — token effort to let
the women know that we’re con-
cerned about their problems and

things like that,’ Webb said.

Webb acknowledges that ad-
ministering the student body
budget is another important
aspect of the Executive Commit-
tee. When a new organization
comes to the EC for money,
Webb said, “If it’s something
that represents a valid student
concern, then I think you should
give maybe like seed money. I’m
willing to take a chance with
something that sounds good.’’

However, Webb said, he would
require the club to have a spec-
ific use in mind for the money
and to show that it has a certain
number of members.

tion. He was freshman represen-
tative to the College Republicans

pointment of a woman ad hoc
member to the Student Control
Committee next year if one is not
elected.

“T think it’s important to avoid
both the appearance of unfair-
ness as well as unfairness it-
self,” he said. ‘‘I think that is one
of the questions the EC will have
to resolve, as far as a woman

feeling she’s potentially not go-

ing to get a fair hearing.”’

A required spot for a female on
the EC, though, will require
more discussion, LeClercq said.

Returning to the issue of hon-
or, LeClercgq said he is disturbed
with what he has heard about
how much information escapes
from closed honor trials.

“‘If a student is accused of an
honor violation and is acquitted,
I feel it’s crucial that the individ-
ual’s right to a closed hearing be
preserved.

“Tt just strikes me as inappro-
priate that details of a closed
honor trial would have been dis-
cussed in some way that would
have breached confidentiality.”

LeClercq said his experience
in student activities — dorm
counselor, a reporter for The
Ring-tum Phi, and a member of
student recruitment and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity
— qualifies him for the job.

“I’m very interested in the
position and think I have the ex-
perience to do a good job,” he
said.
 

 

 

Cooper:

Coeducation will be a major is-
sue next year, and EC secretary
candidate Bill Cooper says he
has an idea of what next year’s
freshman class will be facing.

Cooper, a second-year law stu-
dent from Chatham, N.J., at-
tended Hamilton College in New
York during the first four years
that school was coeducational.

“Especially next year, with
the change to coeducation,
there’s going to be a felt need for
accessibility. People are going
to have to be more conspicuous
than ever,’’ Cooper said. ‘‘May-
be I might be able to drag some
direct experience out of
(Hamilton College)...It gave me
a good basis for being able to
offer a lot to the EC next year.”’

Although he is a law student,
Cooper emphasizes that he
spends plenty of time on the un-
dergraduate campus. He is a
member of the brass and percus-
sion ensemble and works as a
bartender in the Cockpit.

These experiences, Cooper
said, ‘have given me a feeling of
what being a W&L undergrad-
uate is all about....0ver in the
Law School, we don’t get the full
exposure to that whole ethos of
the University that the under-
graduates do.”

On the division between the
Law School and the undergrad-
uate campuses, Cooper said, ‘I
think both sides need to try to
understand the other side a little

Svalina:

Junior Sam Svalina says he
decided to run for Executive
Committee secretary after per-
ceiving that recent student
leaders have ‘‘buckled under”’ to
the University administration
while changes were being made
against the wishes of the student
body.

Specifically, Svalina said,
changes in the fraternity system
that stemmed from a faculty re-
port by the Ad Hoc Committee
on Fraternity Affairs have been
helped along by student leaders
who are “looking for resume fod-
der and not trying to make
waves and not standing up for
what the student body wants.”

“People are fed up with the EC
because they’re being wishy-
washy,”’ he said.

Svalina said he wants a stu-
dent government that represents
the students on the issues that
concern them, but not one that
involves itself in matters that
don’t concern it.

“What they’re there to do is
protect the student body, to re-

present the student body,” he |

said. ‘They're there to guide
and referee.”

‘ff there are rocks rolling
down the hill, they should stop
them, but they shouldn’t go turn-
ing over rocks looking for things
todo,”

Svalina said he supports the
creation of a required spot for a
woman on the Student Control
Committee and the EC.

more. There’s got to be some de-
gree of voluntariness.”’

“We're all students at Wash-
ington and Lee University first
and then undergraduates and
law students.”

At Hamilton, Cooper's activi-
ties included managing the hock-
ey team and performing in the
brass choir.

“T think I have reasonably
good skills at dealing with so
many different types of people,”
Cooper said. ‘I want to make
them feel satisfied that I’m com-
municating with them. I'll try to
do something if I can do it. I’ll
try to be honest with them.”’

The EC secretary, Cooper
said, is ‘‘one of the three people
who represent the student body.
that everybody has access to or

should have access to. I think my
people skills will help me be ac-
cessible."’

During a year off between
Hamilton and W&L, Cooper
worked on the successful state
senate campaign of his state as-
semblywoman. “‘I have a good
grasp of what an elected official
should do,” he said.

Next year’s EC, Cooper said,
“is going to have to exercise a
good deal of leadership just to
preserve what we want to pre-
serve about Washington and
Lee.”’

Among things the EC must
help to preserve are the Honor
System, which promotes trust
and respect for other students,
Cooper said.

“Preserving an atmosphere of
trust and honor is the single
most thing’’ the EC is responsi-
ble for, he added.

Cooper, who was not in a fra-
ternity at Hamilton, said that
regulations on fraternities
should not be imposed but should
be worked out through discus-
sions and compromises.

“I think [the fraternity sys-
tem] plays a vital part in the soc-
ial life. I think it can play a
greater role in the academic life,
in the learning environment, and
I think it should,’’ Cooper said.

Cooper, a history major and
music minor at Hamilton, is
specializing in international law
at W&L.

Elections to be run
by independent board

 

From Staff Reports

 

A rejuvenated Voting Regula-
tions Board will administer Mon-
day's Big Three and referendum
votes.

“There was a potential con-
flict of interest when the Ex-
ecutive Committee conducted
the election and so many of its
members were running again,”
said senior David Hanna, the
newly appointed VRB co-chair-
man.

His co-chair is Bill Metzger
and they have a committee of 10.
“It’s not a closed thing — we
figure, the more the better,”
Hanna said.

Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. in the Davis Dormitory
Quad, outside the Commerce
School and the University Li-
brary and at the Law School.

He said results should be
available at the Executive
Committee room shortly after 7
p.m,

The vote on the constitutional
referendum will be conducted
Monday through Wednesday,
but polls will not be manned the
second two days. Big Three run-
offs are scheduled for next
Thursday.

Spending limits for candidates
this year were increased to $25

“Guys don’t know what girls
want, and you need to have them
represented,” he said.

However, he said, they should
only be in an advisory position,
and not given a vote, unless they
were elected.

One problem that must be
guarded against is women’s and
men’s issues becoming polarized
and creating a rift in the student
body, he said.

In investigating possible honor
violations, Svalina said, he
would treat a violation the same,
regardless of its degree.

“It’s the intent, not the act,”
he said. “‘If he stole a thousand
dollars or a nickel, he stole it and
he should be kicked out.”’

“The EC’s got to be strong,
and I think I’m strong enough to
be on it and do what needs to be
done,”’ he said.

“T feel like I can do what the
student body wants without
worrying about what the admin-
istration or special interest
groups want me to say or do,’’ he
continued.

 

 

 

SAM SVALINA

“It seems to me that the peo-

ple in the Ad Hoc Committee are
trying to change the campus and
put regulations on the student
body.
“The truth of the matter is, I
believe that regulation leads to
regulation and then confusion,
and they’re just doing it to put
their foot down.”’

Svalina said that regulation of
fraternities goes against the
theory of a liberal arts school, in

which students are given a
choice in their education: ‘‘That
choice is being taken away from
the W&L student.”

“The only thing I think the
school should be involved with is
making sure the fraternity isn’t
in the red or falling apart,”’ he
said.

Although the EC doesn’t have
a direct say in fraternity affairs,
Svalina said, he hopes next
year’s EC will support the issues
as the student body sees them.

He said his experience as Chi
Psi’s secretary will help him if
elected. He has also been a
member of the golf team and
worked on the Muscular Dystro-
phy Superdance the last two
years, the last one as special
events chairman.

, for the initial election and $20 for

the runoff.

Each candidate is allowed a
banner as large as a king-size
sheet, and 15 standard-sized pos-
ters. Hanna said ‘‘there seems to
be a fairly high turnover among
the posters,’’ so a large portion
of the spending allowance goes
to printing costs.

The VRB set the rules this
year, another example of its in-
creased authority, and it will do
all ballot-counting. ‘‘The EC is
delegating power,’’ Hanna said.

Sophomore EC representative
Andrew Caruthers worked to es-
tablish the revitalized commit-
tee. ‘‘We don’t bring the SAB in
here to watch them book Fancy

delegate that.”

The Interfraternity Council
also is holding its elections
Monday.

Nominated for president
are juniors David Butler of
Beta Theta Pi and Jamie

current IFC treasurer.

Candidates for vice presi-
dent are juniors Jamie Ber-
ger of Phi Kappa Psi; Eddie
