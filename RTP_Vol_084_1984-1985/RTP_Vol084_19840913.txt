Ron reaches out, touches Clark

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Journalism Professor Clark R. Mollenhoff
quickly had to swallow the last bite of a chicken
sandwich when his office telephone rang Friday
afternoon.

After taking a swig of water to wash down the
remains of the sandwich, Mollenhoff picked up the
phone on the third ring.

The voice on the other end of the line said, “The
President wants to talk to you and he’ll be right on
the line.”’

“T took another gulp of water,”’ said Mollenhoff.

“My first reaction,’ he added, ‘‘was ‘I wonder
what he’s calling about.’ It’s an election year and
presidents do strange things in election years.”’

When President Reagan came on the line, he
said, ‘‘Hello, Clark — or is it Professor? —
Mollenhoff,’’ said Mollenhoff.

“You take your choice, Mr.
Mollenhoff responded.

The conversation that ensued lasted about 20
minutes, Mollenhoff said, and covered topics
ranging from a baseball game Reagan umpired in
Iowa in the 1930s to current problems within the
Defense Department, about which Mollenhoff has
written for The Washington Times.

In fact, Mollenhoff was able to obtain a front-
page story for the Times based on comments

President,”’

Reagan made during the conversation.

Mollenhoff explained to Reagan the problems
that George R. Spanton, an auditor for the Defense
Contract Audit Agency, had after he discovered
increases in prices of spare parts manufactured
by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.

“He was vaguely — he’d heard something of
this,’’ Mollenhoff said, ‘“‘but he was not aware of
the details and to me it was obvious he had been
misled with assurances from (Defense Secretary
Caspar) Weinberger.’’

Reagan asked Mollenhoff to repeat Spanton’s
name, then promised to ‘‘look into’’ the Spanton
case.

Mollenhoff’s story in Monday’s Washington
Times was headlined, ‘‘President will probe
whistle-blower’s case.”’

Mollenhoff said he has had one-on-one conversa-
tions with every President since Dwight
Eisenhower, although he talked with Jimmy
Carter only before he was elected President. This
was his first conversation with Reagan since the
1980 campaign.

Mollenhoff said he was satisfied with both the
conversation in general and with Reagan’s
responses to his questions about the Spanton case.
“Of course,”’ he added, ‘‘this is his strength. He
responds in a way that gives you the impression
and convinces you — it’s very convincing — that
he is genuinely concerned about these matters.”

Interest in W&L up
following coed vote

EE RT tes
By ANDY HOPPES
Assistant News Editor

 

About 450 women have re-
quested applications for admis-
sion next fall to Washington and
Lee, and summer interviews for
both men and women increased
by 67 percent over last year, ac-
cording to the admissions office.

“‘We were not really surprised
by the responses,” said Van
Pate, associate admissions di-
rector, citing the heavy publicity
given W&L’s coed decision.

In addition to the application
requests from females, 402
students were interviewed in
June, July and August, com-
pared to 241 students last year.

Although 67 of the students in-
terviewed were women, Pate
said the number of men inter-
viewed increased by 39 percent
over last year.

“The real surge in visitations
came after the coed announce-
ment. You pretty much have to
attribute the increase to the coed
decision,’’ he added.

“Tt kept us all on the move,”’
Pate said. ‘“We used to feel we
were having a busy day if we in-
terviewed seven or eight stu-
dents. There were days this sum-
mer when we interviewed 14.”

Although few of the students
he interviewed said coeducation
was the reason for their interest
in W&L, Pate said coeducation
was discussed in almost every
interview.

Women students shun ‘the WGL attitude’

ANALYSIS

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

Women at area colleges feel that
Washington and Lee men are often self-
centered and unapproachable to the point of
being rude, according to a recent informal
survey.

Furthermore, many students at the five
local women’s schools say they prefer the
punch-and-cookies politeness of Hampden-
Sydney College to the drunken fraternity
debauchery that results in what they refer to
as ‘‘the W&L attitude.’

The young ladies noted that especially dur-
ing initial visits, they found that a ‘‘stand-

ffis] elitist attitude frequently prevails at

parties. This cantrasts sharply with the

lavish, even fawning, attention they receive
at Hampden-Sydney functions.

Kathryn Pearce, a senior at Mary Baldwin
College, said she’s noticed a sharp difference
in the attitudes exhibited at the two schools,
both of which currently have all-male under-
graduate student bodies.

‘First impressions make a

big difference, and Hampden-

Sydney makes a better one.”

“The Hampcen-Sydney guys love meeting
new people much more than the guys at
W&L,” she said. ‘‘Hampden-Sydney guys ap-
preciate it so much more when we ¢ r

here

‘Although they are still concerned about
the freshmen going through Rush, the girls
get about equai time and attention,’’ she con-
tinued. “At W&L, girls take a back seat.”’

Kara Albert, a junior at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, perceived similar pro-
blems at W&L. ‘‘A lot of girls go to Hampden-
Sydney because they are a lot more friendly
down there,’’ she said,

“Until you know a few people at W&L, no
one talks to you,’’ she explained. ‘‘That’s the
big complaint about W&L guys with Randy

‘Mac girls — that they won’t come up and talk

to you.”

Ms. Albert said that girls are ‘‘an ornament
for freshmen’ at Hampden Sydney as much
as they are at W&L, but at Hampden Sydney
they ‘‘still have a good time — we’re not put

Pate said that he expects
women’s interest in W&L to con-
tinue during the fall.

‘‘We haven’t done a thing yet
to affect the interest of women.
When we start doing the college
nights and visiting schools, we'll
start to collect names of women.
That’s another good source of
applicants,’’ Pate said.

The travel schedule of admis-
sions office personnel will be
“beefed up” this year, according
to Pate, as representatives of the
university begin visiting girls’
high schools and coed high
schools from which women had
not been recruited previously.
Pate said that regardless of the
result of the coed decision, the
admissions office had been plan-
ning to increase the travel
schedule. Several extra days

Bob Jenevein, last year’s
student body president, helped
organize the event that Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan called
“the highlight”’ of last month’s
Republican National Conven-
tion.

Jenevein was a member of
the production staff for the
prayer breakfast the morning
after the close of the conven-
tion, which took place in Jene-
vein’s home city of Dallas.
President Reagan spoke at the
meeting, which received ex-
tensive media coverage, in-
cluding a front-page story in
The New York Times.

“The prayer breakfast
helped Ronald Reagan secure
the high moral ground in this
country, but at the same time
it brought him some intense
criticism,’’ Jenevein said.

He secured the position,
which meant three weeks of
17-hour days, while being in-
terviewed for a job in real
estate. He gave his interests
as ‘‘football and politics —
especially Republican
politics,’ and half an hour
later he was on the prayer
breakfast staff.

Does fall Rush
deserve a bid?

Tradition, some say, passes
slowly at Washington and Lee.
In some instances, the longevity
of tradition has served us well,
most notable being our all-male
tradition, sacred until it fell like
the Bastille last July. Other
traditions have not served us as
well, most notably that of fall
Rush.

Fall Rush simply doesn’t
work. It sounds odd, but the
back-to-school rush to get new
fraterntiy members has meant,
I daresay, the loss of many
‘‘brothers.’’ By starting the year
with party, party, party, study-
ing has traditionally taken a
back seat, and many freshmen
— far more, I am willing to bet,
than those at schools with defer-
red Rush — are caught with
more than their pants down
come mid-term reports. Over
the years, faculty, students and
the IFC have devised numerous
ways to change Rush so that
both parties (pardon the pun)
benefit in the long run. Frater-
nities need pledge dollars to beef
up Rush-weakened bank ac-
counts; faculty want to see
freshmen in their 8 o’clock (and
all thereafter) classes; students
want to have fun and then study.

This year’s two-week Rush
seemed just the solution to all
those competing interests. In
two short weeks (only one in-
volving classes), Rush would be
over and swept under the carpet
with the fall housecleaning.
Smiles all around the table.

But freshmen, and even some
frats, are losing. Freshmen were
given little time to see all 17
frats, even less time to see them
in a serious, non-partying state
(is that even possible?), and no
time to think over the role they
wished to play in the W&L social

scene. Some fraternities lose
because one party may not have
been the best or because, in the
quick judgments they must
make, freshmen noticed the
given frat had few members.
Freshmen, in this rushed Rush,
must make a very superficial
judgment for what may be the
most important decision they
ever make at Washington an
Lee. Caught up in what one
songwriter has termed ‘‘cosmet-
ic fixation,” they are prone to
mistakes, and expensive ones at
that. A $5,000 decision on the
basis of three hours of casual
chatter and guzzling is bad
business any way around it.

I believe the only solution to
the Rush dilemma is a deferred
Rush. Hold onto your red pens,
faculty. That doesn’t mean a
whole fall of Rush parties. It
means for freshmen a chance to
see a fraternity which must give
up partying before mid-terms
and finals. It means for fresh-
men a chance to see all the
fraternities at leisure and a
chance to explore those he likes.
For fraternities, a deferred
Rush would mean a _ better
chance to rush those freshmen
they most want and not just
those which appear to be okay in
the three times you see them.

Sure, a deferred Rush might
mean a few months of restricted
partying for fraternities unless
they get smart and change their
billing schedules. But when the
decision hinges on the fraterni-
ty’s very existence at W&L 10 or
15 years from now, the effort
seems worthwhile.

Like coeducation, the transi-
tion to a deferred Rush need only
be as painful as we make it.

Let the past be but the past

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott Tilley

“strive to have the nobleness
of character and mildness of
self...to let the past be but the

past.”

— General Robert E. Lee
4 On July 14,

jsides felt like
jthey had been
4sliced, and
emotions
iy a poured out like
a velenae. I was caught up in a
whirlwind of angerness and bit-
terness, all underlined by a
sense of betrayal.

Coeducation, at least to me,
seemed to be an irrevocable
change made for dubious
reasons. Something that I had
come to love and given three
years of my life to had been sud-
denly taken away from me. I felt
powerless to prevent it, which
was the most frustrating aspect.

Those feelings have now sub-
sided into a sense of sadness, a
void similar to that I felt when
my favorite dog died. Is this
year, my senior year, nothing
more than an anachronism, an
enigma destined to be _ re-
membered only in the nostalgia
of W&L as the end of a 235-year-
old era?

Thinking about my _ history
lessons, in retrospect I reckoned
myself similar to Neville
Chamberlain. Desperately I was
clinging to a world that I had
come to love, simply because I
had become secure and comfor-
table in it. Clinging, I was ignor-
ing the inevitable. No wonder,
then, I was shocked when Hitler
invaded my Czechoslavakia.

It is easy to become secure
and complacent in our ‘‘comfort
zones.’’ We all do it. But more
often than not, it is only when we

are bold enough to step, outside are

of our comfort zones that we
challenge ourselves and build
our character such that we
become better men.

So, like Chamberlain, maybe I
had been wrong. Had I been an
appeaser at the cost of W&L’s
academic quality? Had I been an
appeaser at the cost of admis-
sions standards? Could it be that
John Wilson was not W&L’s
Hitler?

Still, I felt betrayed.

After I returned home from
Lexington that fateful weekend,
I felt a great sense of loss and
uncertainty. I told a friend that I
was going to do some reading to
find some truth in the situation.

“The Bible?” he asked.

“No, my books on Robert E.
Lee.”

General Lee’s name had been
invoked during the controversy
to support both sides of the
issue..

“General Lee would have been
in favor.”

“No way. He would have been
opposed.”’

Both are perversions of the
great ideals for which the
General stood. I forced myself to
admit that he was not turning in
his grave. Rather, he is anxious-
ly anticipating the reactions of
those who dearly love the Uni-
versity.

Now that the decision has been
made, we can once again open
our history books and follow the
General’s example, as we do

Well, it’s another year of

means:

The only day of the semester
when there are lines in the text-
book section of the Bookstore.

Trashcans full of half-

The only week all semester

their advisers and professors.

A sign in the Bookstore advis-
ing students to go to their first
class before buying books.

Professors asking students in
that first class why they haven’t
already bought their books.

the class begins.

Centel to leave Lexington for Charlottesville

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

“It’s not too late till they lock
that door. Then it’s too late.”

Emily Tillery, a _ service
representative who has worked
for the Lexington phone com-
pany for more than 28 years, is
hoping for — but not expecting
—a reprieve from Centel’s plan-
ned. closing of its Lexington
business office Nov. 2.

“We've called everybody we
could think of,”’ she said. ‘‘We’re
not sure what we can do, and we
don’t want to do anything wrong
and get fired for it. But it’s like
my husband said: Losing your

job is like somebody dying.”

The office closing is part of a
Centel ‘‘consolidation program”
announced this summer, under
which eight Virginia service of-
fices will close between now and
November. 2

Lexington customers will be
served from the Charlottesville
office, which is about 70 miles
away, in an attempt to ‘‘reduce
césts and enhance efficiency,”
the company said.

The operations of satellite

facilities such as Lexington will

be combined with those of four
remaining business offices,
eliminating 33 positions state-
wide and saving a projected $3.2

million over the next five years.

Nine employees are slated to
lose their jobs when the Lex-
ington office merges with the
Charlottesville location. The
resulting savings are projected
at $94,000 during 1985.

“What this savings will mean
is that rate increases will not be
as great as some were in the
past,”’ said W.H. Camden, head
of Centel’s Lexington office.

“There’s mixed reaction from
the public, but most of them
understand the cost savings
when it’s explained to them in
detail,”’ he added.

Camden said economies of
scale result from moving per-

sonnel and paperwork to one
central office in a larger city.
The greater efficiency he said
would be passed along in savings
to customers.

He added that customers will
be able to pay their telephone
bills at local banks and will be
able to return telephones when
necessary to a nearby service
facility.

Jim Davis, director of the
Division of Communication of
the State Corporation Commis-
sion, which regulates Centel,
said the commission would be
“‘very hesitant’’ to criticize the
office closings in light of the
potential savings to customers.

“The commission has deter-
mined that the company is try-
ing to save money,” he said.
“That’s what they’re supposed
to be doing. It seems that they’re
trying to help themselves — and
their customers.’’

Davis noted, however, that
Centel had mishandled the
public relations aspect of the
move. ‘‘We think Centel sort of
dropped the ball in letting the
public know what they were do-
ing,’’ he said.

Both Lexington City Council
and the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors passed
resolutions shortly after the an-
nouncement requesting that
Centel provide customers with
further details of the anticipated
effects of closing the office.

“Our area has been, and still
remains, subject to documented
poor telephone service that can
only be made worse by such a
closure,” the Lexington resolu-
tion said.

Camden said that although ‘‘in
past years the service was less
than to be desired,’”’ the recent
installation of newer switching
equipment has resulted in ‘“‘ex-
cellent service.”

Lexington Mayor Charles F.
Phillips, a Washington and Lee
economics professor, said of-
ficials have been meeting with
Centel representatives, and that
“they have not been unrespon-
sive to our concerns.”

“IT feel rather strongly that if
you lose that local contact, you
potentially have greater service
problems,” he said, however.

“It’s taking place at a time
when the whole telecommunica-
tions industry is changing, and
there’s tremendous confusion
among customers, and it’s not
going to be any better,” Phillips
added.

The service representatives,
meanwhile, remain unconvinced
that the move is necessary,
although Camden notes that ‘‘no
one ever likes to be transferred
or relocated.”

Those whose positions are be-
ing eliminated have the option of
relocating to Charlottesville or

WGL ‘famous’ in Kansas, a ‘quirk’ in Pa.

Assistant News Editor

 

“Washington and Lee Univ.

That’s how the Nashville Ten-

that a small university in Lex-

year-old tradition.

now will be required to visit
girls’ schools, he added.

Pate said the women he inter-
viewed were interested in the
same majors and career goals
as the male students. There also
seems to be no distinct pattern of
where the women contacting
W&L live.

The women interviewed so far
tend to excel academically and
participate in school activities,
he said.

“They seem to be well
qualified. They’re going to be
very reasonable candidates for
admission. In fact, reasonable
might be a little mild,’ Pate
said.

Pate said that the University
is ‘‘not wedded to any particular
number’’ of females it would like
to enroll in 1985.

“The number of women who
will enroll will all depend on the
number who are qualified,’ he
said. ‘‘We are not going to use a
double standard.”

 

 

were not alone in receiving quick
notice of W&L’s change. News-
papers across the country, from
Miami to Walla Walla, Wash.,
carried wire service accounts of
the decision.

Jeff Hanna, director of the
W&L News Office, says students
and faculty members will soon
get a chance to look through a
collection of news clippings
about W&L’s decision from
papers across the country. A
clipping service, hired by the
university has seen copies of
hundreds of articles chronicling
the decision.

“I’ve resisted using these clip-
ping services in the past, but this
was something we wanted to
keep track of,’’ Hanna said. It
was worth it. Three months
before the coeducation decision
was made in July, the clipping
service began sending the news
office a copy of every story car-
ried in a newspaper around the
country about W&L. Clippings
concerning the initial announce-
ment of the decision are still
coming in.

“Once we get it more com-
plete, we may take it over to the
library for people to see it,”
Hanna said.

He said the decision probably
received as much notice as it did
in cities far from Lexington
because the decision was made
on a weekend. Newspapers, he
pointed out, are always in need
of filler material on Sundays and
Mondays, when hard news is
scarce.

Newspapers in many cities
east of the Mississippi carried
fairly long versons of the wire
service stories about the deci-
sion, while smaller newspapers
used the story to fill an inch or
two of empty space. No two
headlines were the same — or
even similar. “My favoriate
headline is from the Wichita
Falls Times,’”’ said Hanna. “It
said ‘Famous University Goes
Coed.’ ”

The Norristown (Pa.) Times-
Herald carried the W&L story
under a section entitled ‘‘Quirks
in the News.” The item below
the W&L story dealt with the ar-
rest of three nude sunbathers at
Assateague Island.

Prominent papers such as The
New York Times, USA Today
and The Washington Post also

carried stories about W&L and
coeducation.

“We came very close to being
in Time Magazine the next
week,’’ Hanna said.

Time’s Atlanta bureau resear-
ched the article and interviewed
President John D. Wilson and
several other people involved in
the decision, explained Hanna.
The story got ‘‘bumped’’ from
the issue because it was a busy
news week, with the Olympics
approaching and Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro being selected as
Walter Mondale’s running mate,
he added.

Hanna said he was surprised
more newspapers did not play up
the fact that W&L announced it
was going coed during the same
week that Mondale selected Fer-

raro as the first woman to run
for vice president on a major
party ticket. Hanna said only
USA Today and a radio talk
show host in Beaufort, S.C.,
seemed interested in the
parallels between the Ferraro
nomination and the coed deci-
Sion.

Hanna said he did notice
several errors in the wire ser-
vice stories. The Associated
Press story erroneously re-
ported that George Washington
had founded W&L, and a United
Press International article
described W&L as a place where
most of the students wear ties
voluntarily.

“I don’t think anyone was
wrong about the decision,’ Han-
na said.

Vacation change not recommended

 

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

A proposal to replace the
Thanksgiving vacation with a
one-week October vacation will
not be recommended to the
faculty Executive Committee by
another faculty committee,
University Registrar Harold S.
Head said this week.

The faculty Committee on
Registration and Schedules, of
which Head is chairman, will
recommend to the faculty EC
Monday that the University
lengthen classes from 50 to 55
minutes and that the 12-124
academic claendar be retained.

Head’s committee was asked
to review the proposals made by
an ad hoc calendar committee

established last year to review
W&L’s academic calendar.

The 11-member calendar com-
mittee, which included two
students, submitted its report to
President John D. Wilson April
30.

The package presented to
Wilson included a three-page
report containing four major
propositions: 1) retaining the
12-12-46 calendar; 2) extending
class periods from 50 to 55
minutes, thus extending the
school day from 8 a.m. to 5:55
p.m.; 3) eliminating Thanksgiv-
ing vacation and adding a one-
week break in the middle of Oc-
tober; 4) seeking more ways of
simplifying and reducing the ex-
cessive amount of time and

paper work now involved in.

registration and changes in
registration caused by drop-
adds.

The Registration and
Schedules Committee opposes
the third and fourth recommen-
dations, Head said.

Attached to the calendar com-
mittee’s report is a five-page ap-
pendix containing a proposal for
a calendar consisting of five six-
week terms that would allow for
more flexibility than the current
calendars. That proposal was to
be distributed to department
heads for future consideration.

Ina poll taken by the calendar
committee last spring, more
than 620 students responded.
Results of the poll showed 90.3
percent of the students favoring
the 12-12-6 calendar, 78.9 percent
opposed to 55-minute classes,
93.8 percent opposed to elim-
inating Thanksgiving break, and
98.9 percent opposed to a one
time per year class registration
period.

According to John H. Wise,
chemistry professor and chair-
man of the calendar committee,
the proposals probably will go to
the University Council, con-
sisting of both students and
faculty, after the faculty EC.

“Their (the U.C.’s) recom-
mendations would be brought to
the faculty as a whole,” said
Wise. ‘All these other commit-
tees are doing is making recom-
mendations. The faculty has the
final say on it.”’

The entire faculty was
originally expected to vote on
the proposals in Ootober. ‘‘I
think that’s what they'd like to
do. I don’t know if they’ll be able
to do it,’’ Head said. “If any
changes are made, they would
have to be made before the end
of this calendar year,’’ said
Wise.

From Staff Reports

Two of the five women newly
appointed to the Washington and
Lee faculty said this week they

have few problems teaching.

their male students, who seem to
be enthusiastic.

“I felt the men would be more
reserved but I have found that
not to be true ... they have been
enthusiastic and _ energetic,”
said Kathy Jo Koberstein, assis-
tant professor of romance
languages.

“So far, I just think it’s fan-
tastic,”’ said Adoracion Campis,
also an assistant professor of
romance languages. ‘‘They
seem very enthusiastic and will-
ing to work hard.”

Ms. Campis, who taught at
Columbia College in New York
before it began admitting
women a year ago, said, ‘‘Here,
the students are more easy-
going, friendlier...in New York,
they’re a little more reserved.”

Both language professors

noted the problems of trying to
teach such things as ‘Miss,’
‘“‘Mrs.”’ and ‘‘Mr.”’ to an all-male
class.

The atmosphere of W&L will
change when women enter the
school next fall, Ms. Koberstein
said. “I think the women that
come here will be bright and
assertive and that it will be
positive for men. around here to

interact with them,” she added.

“It will be an exciting time —

coeducation, a new dean and a
new curriculum — the changes
have really intrigued me.”’

Ms. Campis said the admis-
sion of women will ‘‘not be a
negative thing” and that “it was
hinted that the University was
thinking about coeducation”
when she applied for the posi-
tion.

“T like it this way,” she added,
‘but I think it will be good also
as a coed school.”

Dawson says EC hopes to assist
committees in planning for coed

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee’s
primary goal this year is to ease
the transition to coeducation,
student body President Cole
Dawson said after the year’s
first EC meeting Monday night.

Dawson said the EC plans to
work closely with a number of
campus committees to see
whether any changes need to be
made before women are admit-
ted next fall.

Those committees include the
Board of Trustees’ Committee
on Coeducation, a_ student-
faculty committee chaired by
Assistant Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson and a possible
female committee that would be
chaired by a law student.

Although Dawson voted a-
gainst coeducation in last year’s
EC recommendation to the
Board of Trustees, he said he is
now. a_ strong supporter of
coeducation and will do all he
can to prepare the school for it.

As incoming student body
president, Dawson participated
in the board’s extensive co-
education study and declared at
the July press conference an-
nouncing the coeducation deci-
sion that he had decided during
the summer to support the
change.

“Last year I started out
vehemently opposed to coeduca-
tion,’’ Dawson said this week. ‘‘I
didn’t think Wé&L traditions
would be able to survive with
coeducation.”’

“But every time the board
met, new evidence was pre-
sented that pointed toward

coeduation,”’ he continued.

“I decided to support coeduca-
tion three weeks before the deci-
sion, but I did not overwhelming-
ly support it,’’ Dawson recalled.

“The trustees would look at
me and say, ‘Cole, do we get the
impression that you are for
coeducation?’ and I’d_ say,
‘Yeah,’ and they’d say, ‘Wow.’ ”’

Another of Dawson’s goals is
to make the ‘‘White Book’’ on the
Honor Code more readable for
students. The White Book revi-
sion process begins in January.

Dawson said a lecture from a
graduate stressing the impor-
tance of the honor system that
the freshmen were given during
orientation this year should be
helpful in increasing their a-
wareness of the system.

The new president said he
hopes to increase communica-
tion with the student body and to
make sure that students under-
stand the workings of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, especially
during this year of change.

Last year’s Executive Com-
mittee was criticized for the
haste with which it acted on
some matters, including at-
tempting to reduce the number
of guilty votes needed to convict
a student in a public honor trial
and requesting that professors
require students to wear ties to
class.

“On any major issue I never
want to make a quick decision,”’
Dawson said.

“I think in the past — not
necessarily singling out last
year — a lot of big issued came
up, and the EC president reacted
immediately.’

Representatives of the Ex-

Jecutive Committee and the Stu-

dent Bar Association have
scheduled a meeting today to
determine the percentage of
Law School student taxes that
will be kept by the SBA this year.

EC Vice President James
White, chairman of the EC’s
finance subcommittee, said the
EC returned 79.5 percent of law
student taxes to the SBA last
year. He added that he expects
this year’s, percentage to be
about 80 percent.

The Law School tax increased
by $5 this year, White said. At to-
day’s meeting, SBA officers will
indicate whether that increase
will cover Law School expenses.

“We're going to give the SBA
what they need,’’ White said. He
added that the EC expects a
figure of between 80 and 82 per-
cent, but it will not accept
anything greater than 85 per-
cent.

“If they need more money,
they can come to us at the end of
the year,”’ he said.

White, junior EC represen-
tative Pay Hayden and SBA

EC, SBA to decide

law school allotment

President John Sicilian met last
week and agreed on an estimate
of 80 percent, White said, but
that figure must be approved by
the SBA’s Board of Governors.

Sicilian could not be reached
for comment this week.

This year marks the first time
that the SBA has been auton-
omous from the EC. In past
years, the EC has allocated
funds to the SBA as if it were a
club. However, because. law
students do not participate in
many undergraduate activities,
the SBA wanted to handle its
own money.

Last year, about 20 percent of
the Law School student taxes
went to the EC. White called that
a fair percentage because law
students comprise about 20 per-
cent of the total student body.

“T think it’s going to work out
really good,’’ he added.

Based on an estimate of 350
law students, the total amount of
Law School taxes will be $26,250,
80 percent of which is $21,000.
This means an additional $5,250
would go to the EC this year.

Law students pay a $100 stu-
dent activities fee (the same as
undergraduates) and an addi-
tional $20 to the SBA.

Spaulding, director of the
Virginia Film Office, said this
week.

Representatives of the com-
pany visited Lexington with
Spaulding three times during
June and “found a number of
sites they liked and wanted to
use,’’ Spaulding said.

Among those were the Robert
E. Lee Episcopal Church, the
restored Main Street area and
some locations near the Visitor’s
Center, he added.

The 18-hour miniseries for
ABC-TV is to be based on John
Jakes’ Civil War novel, ‘North

Warner Brothers had planned
to film in Front Royal and Rich-
mond in addition to Lexington,
Spaulding said.

After negotiations with ABC,
though, the company was forced
to reduce its production budget
and change its timetable,

eliminating Lexington and Front _

Royal.

The company now plans to
film in Richmond for about a
month early next year, he add-
ed.

Filming will be done in four
states for the miniseries, which
Spaulding said will have a ‘‘very

Pavilion to open Oct. 12;
students to have priority

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Lacking only some paint and
floor covering, the long-awaited
student activities pavilion under
construction near Lewis Hall
will be unveiled Oct. 12,
according to University of-
ficials.

Scott Beebe, assistant super-
intendent of Buildings and
Grounds, said the finishing

every day here at Washington
and Lee.

General Lee fought the
greatest Lost Cause of all, one
much greater than our fight. His
motives were much more
honorable and his consequences
of losing were far greater than
ours.

Yet, upon the inevitable
defeat, he was not bitter. His
devotion to reconciliation and
transition earned him much of
the honorable reputation he en-
joys today — a major reason his
name is held in higher esteem
than that of Jefferson Davis.

I cannot hide my disappoint-
ment. We cannot be expected to
do so. But let us too put bit-
terness aside and work for
reconciliation and transition.

Let us put our devotion to the
University above one aspect of
it. And let us strive for that
nobleness of character that will
allow us to let the past be but the
past and look instead to the ex-
citing and prosperous days
ahead at Washington and Lee.

touches on the building, which
was begun in June, should be
completed by mid-November.

In addition to serving as a site
for a wide range of social ac-
tivities, the pavilion will double
as an athletic facility, par-
ticularly during inclement
weather, according to Beebe,
who is overseeing the construc-
tion.

When completed, the activities
floor will be covered with Mon-
doflex, a quarter-inch, rubber-
based surface similar to that on
many gymnasium floors. The
surface is designed to withstand
the rubber cleats of athletes and
the ground-in beer and cigaret-
tes of dancers.

‘“‘We checked (the surface) at
a similar installation up at
Northwestern, and they said that
they got along fine,”’ said Frank
Parsons, assistant to the Univer-
sity president.

A raised stage has been con-
structed at one end of the
pavilion, and a doubles tennis
court will be marked out on the
main floor. The building is 150
feet long and 92 feet wide and
has a 24-foot tall ceiling.

One of the reasons the pavilion
was built, Parsons said, was to
provide a location for special ac-
tivities other than Evans Dining
Hall and Warner Center.

Another consideration, he
said, was reducing the amount of
driving between campus and
Zollman’s Pavilion, where many
parties have been held in the
past.

A set of guidelines governing
the use of the pavilion was
drawn up last year by the Stu-
dent Activities Board, approved
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee and reviewed by the Board of
Trustees.

The guidelines give first
priority to university-wide social
functions, second priority to
university organizations not
open to all students and third
priority to community and non-
college groups. The pavilion will
have a capacity of about 1,200
people.

“I think it’s going to work out
so that when the students need it,
then that will be the higher
priority,’’ Parsons said.

All social events will be coor-
dinated through Associate Dean
of Students Mike Cappeto and
the SAB, The events may be
scheduled only on weekends, and
the fee is $75 for university
organizations and $150 for non-
university groups, excluding
clean-up costs.

W&L students paid an addi-
tional $25 in activities fees this
year to help finance the pavilion,
which will cost about $650,000.

Mesner to plead not guilty; bond hearing set

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

The man charged with arson
and murder in connection with
last spring’s fraternity house
fire said today that he will plead
not guilty to both charges.

“There’s not much of a deci-
sion to make,” Scot Tanner
‘Mesner said in an interview this
morning at the Rockbridge
County Jail. ‘I’m going to plead
innocent. I am innocent.”’

Mesner, a 19-year-old resident
of Hollins College near Roanoke,
has been held at the jail since he
was indicted Sept. 4 by a Rock-
bridge County grand jury.

A local magistrate has set bail
at $150,000 for a cash bond or
$300,000 for a property bond.

Eric L. Sisler, a local Lex-
ington lawyer who is represen-
ting Mesner, said a bond hearing
has been set for next Wednes-
day.

Attorney G. Marshall Mundy
of Roanoke, who is also repre-
senting Mesner, confirmed that
his client will plead not guilty to
both charges. He called the
amount of the bail ‘‘exorbitant.’’

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton, one of the officers who
arrested Mesner, said a request
for a reduction in bail is ‘‘almost
routine when the amount is that
high.”

Mesner said he was familiar
with the evidence that will be us-
ed in the case, and added, ‘‘I
don’t know how they got an in-
dictment from it.”

“There’s no way in the world
they can prove I was here,” he
said. ‘I can prove I wasn’t
here.”

“Certainly the evidence points
toward me, but it’s not very
strong,” he added.

Commonwealth’s Attorney

Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read said he
could not comment on the nature
of the evidence against Mesner,
but said the suspect could not be
familiar with it.

“His lawyers have not seen
any of the evidence we have
against him, nor has he,’’ Read
said.

Read said there are no plea
negotiations underway between
him and representatives of
Mesner.

Mesner said he’d spent a lot of
time thinking about the charges
against him. “I’m sorry that
Tom died, regardless of how it

happened, because I knew him,”
he said.

Sophomore Thomas J. Fellin
died of smoke inhalation in the
April fire that destroyed the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house.

Chief Sutton said Mesner was
jailed within hours of the grand
jury charge by authority of a
document issued along with the
indictments that serves in lieu of
an arrest warrant.

Nearly 40 other people were in-
dicted by the Sept. 4 panel. The
police chief said he was uncer-
tain whether any of the other in-
dividuals have been taken into

Fini sees Rush, building
as the keys to its future

By BILL MARTIEN
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

 

 

Members of Phi Gamma Delta
say a new house and a strong
Rush should mean a bright
future for the fraternity despite
the fire that destroyed their
house last spring.

Rush chairman Art Candarian
said 73 people signed up for Rush
open houses at Fiji, and that the
house has been pleased with the
enthusiastic response of fresh-
men.

“The freshmen coming
through Fiji represent a diverse
group of guys from many dif-
ferent states,’ Candarian said.

The focal point of Fiji’s Rush
program has been at 108 Henry
St., where a number of the
fraternity’s members live.

Candarian said he is concern-
ed about dirty rushing, but is
otherwise optimistic about the
fraternity’s pledge prospects.

Several members said the fact

that the fire had brought them
closer together had been helpful
to their Rush effort.

Next year’s Rush should be
quite a bit easier, Candarian
said, since by that time they
should have a new house.

Construction has begun on a
new building on the same site as
the old one. The foundation and
three of the existing walls likely
will be retained.

Candarian said insurance pro-
ceeds are expected to cover the
cost of the new structure.

Two sets of plans are being
considered for: the house. The
finished building is expected to
be similar in appearance to the
old one.

Some members were not total-
ly satisfied with the indictment
of a suspect for the burning of
the house and the death of soph-
omore Thomas J. Fellin.

“Finding the arsonist doesn’t
do any good,” Candarian said.
“It doesn’t bring Tom back.”

custody.

“The reason he was arrested
so quickly was that we didn’t
want him to flee or establish an
alibi,” Sutton said. ‘“There are
all kinds of things he could have
done if he had been allowed to go
free.’”’

“TI couldn’t believe it,’’ Mesner

said of the arrest at the Roanoke
restaurant where he worked. ‘‘I
was on my first day of training,
following another waiter down
the aisle, and the cops come in
and cuff me and stuff me.

“Tt made a real scene in the
restaurant.”

Despite Ms. Albert’s criticism
of the attitude of W&L men, she
still prefers to party in Lex-
ington rather than in Farmville.

“Until you know a few people
at W&L, no one talks to you,’’ she
explained. ‘‘That’s the big com-
plaint about W&L guys with
Randy Mac girls — that they
won’t come up and talk to you.”

Ms. Albert said that girls are
“an ornament for freshmen’’ at
Hampden Sydney as much as
they are at W&L, but at Hamp-
den Sydney they ‘“‘still have a
good time — we're not put
upon.”’

“I think Hampden-Sydney
men are sort of gooberish, ac-
tually,”’ she said. “It’s just that
they are really eager to meet
girls.”’

Trichel Berryman commented
on the W&L party system from
the perspective of a Hollins Col-
lege freshman.

“You meet a million people
during rush,” she said. ‘“‘They
have to go through the routine:
‘What’s your name?’, ‘Where

and remaining in Lexington.

Mary Staton, who began work-
ing for the phone company in
Lexington in 1952, says she’ll
probably accept one of the
operator positions.

“T’ve been up there before in
operator services,’’ she said, ad-
ding that the change would be
“kind of inconvenient” because
‘the hours are split and I have a
small son and live 10 miles out of
town.”’

Mrs. Staton says the Lex-
ington office is important
because ‘‘the customer is
definitely first here.’’ She wor-
ries that the ‘consolidation will
harm elderly customers and
those without checking accounts
who pay their bills in cash.

Marie Odend’hal, who is in her
29th year with the company, was
offered either an operator ser-
vices or a janitor job in Lex-
ington.

She has enrolled in a night typ-
ing class at Lexington High
School in hopes of qualifying for
a plant clerk job at the Centel
service facility on U.S. 60 outside
Lexington.

“I don’t think the customers’
bills are going to go down and
they’re not going to stay the
same,’’ she said.

Mrs. Tillery said it’s ‘‘rough’’
to think of not seeing her
customers again.

“We know most of our
customers by name because
we’ve been here so long,” she
said. “It’s a big company. When
they leave here, they’ll never be
able to provide the same per-
sonal service.”’

“It’s just a big thing,” she con-
tinued. ‘‘They’re losing all their
personal touches.’’

“I’m not sure anyone wants to
hear about it,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s
what hurts. They say they’re

 

 

are you from?’, ‘What year are

you?’, ‘Where’s your
hometown?’.
“The freshmen are just glad to

be there but they can’t wait till
it’s over,’’ continued Ms. Ber-
ryman. ‘‘Overall, it’s not so bad,
because it’s temporary.”

She hopes the situation will im-
prove after Rush. ‘‘The girls are
not getting the attention now
that they may get when Rush is
over,” she said. “There are so
many girls here at parties,
though, that by the time we roll
in around 11 o’clock, we have to
approach the guys.”’

“A lot of guys say in essence,
“You’re here to meet us,’ ’’ Ms.
Berryman complained. ‘But
overall I love it, it’s a fun place
and there are all the good
elements of a party, as well.”’

Margaret Kennedy, a first-
year student at Southern
Seminary, has noticed that the
parties get better after everyone
has had a beer or two to relax.

“At most of the parties I’ve
been to, they’ve all been pretty
wasted and they seemed to have
loosened up by the time I got
there,”’ she said.

Ms. Kennedy said she has
discovered going to parties with

sorry we’re leaving but I don’t
think they really care. If they
did, they’d try to do something
about it.”

Dorothy Coleman, a 27-year
veteran of the Lexington phone
company, said she’ll probably
accept the transfer to Charlot-
tesville because Centel, ‘is a
good company to work for.”’

“T’m afraid I'll have to drive,”’
she said. ‘‘I don’t think I’d want
to quit.”

“I love my job,” she con-
tinued. ‘We're a close-knit fami-
ly that works well together.
Sometimes it takes face-to face
contact to get the job done. I
think we really go overboard to
try to help the customers.”’

She said that a_ special
pleasure of the job is the annual
influx of students at Washington
and Lee and Southern Seminary.

“We look forward to the

students every year,”’ she said.
“They’re like our children when
they come back each year. We
try to educate them about how
they can get stuck with their
bills and things like that.”

“T can’t see the savings,’’ Mrs.
Coleman said of the consolida-
tion. ‘I’m sure it’s there. Maybe
I just don’t want to see it.”’

itial moments at the houses.

“It’s not too hard to get in-
troduced then, because if I am
with somebody they know, then
they come over and I get in-
troduced,” she said.

Polly Paton, a sophomore at
Sweet Briar, noticed the dif-
ference in behavior at the two
schools.

“First impressions make a big
difference, and Hampden-
Sydney makes a better one,”’ she
said. “The Hampden-Sydney
guys make more of an effort to
talk to girls.

“When you go to W&L, it’s
more like a meatmarket situa-
tion, because you know they are
looking around to decide if you
are good-looking enough to talk
to.”

“Once you meet a W&L guy or
two, then everybody is really
friendly,’ Ms. Paton continued.

“If you are an outgoing type of
girl, then you can make it
work,”’ she added. ‘But a lot of
girls aren’t that way.”’

Ms. Paton contends that there
are more important things than
perfect manners, however: ‘‘I’d
still rather go to W&L than
Hampden-Sydney.”’

T ough schedule, tough team

LES
By MICHAEL McALLISTER

Staff Writer

There can be no doubt that the
1984 Washington and Lee soccer
team has quite a_ difficult
schedule this season.

In what head coach Rolf
Piranian calls ‘‘the most
challenging schedule W&L has
ever had,” the Generals will
face defending national cham-
pion UNC-Greensboro and four
other potential contenders for
NCAA post-season tournament
bids. But Piranian is confident
that his team can meet the
schedule’s challenges.

“T feel that it is a tribute to our
players that we have such tough
competition because we have the
talent to win each game,’’ said
the General’s mentor.

Piranian’s confidence is a
result of the fact that the
Generals are a very experienced
team. Only three players were
lost to graduation from last
year’s 8-5 team, but the loss in-
cludes former All-South forward

Roland Simon.

Tremendous talent is also an
important asset to the team this
year. “This is the most talent we
have had in my four years, and if
we play consistently, the
playoffs are very possible,” said
senior Mark Sullivan, one of the
team’s three captains.

“Our defense must be up for
every game if we are to be suc-
cessful,”’ said Piranian. The
defense could be a key to the
season and a team strength if
they play tough every game.
Captain and three-year starter
Rob Coleman, a senior, returns
at sweeper, while senior Todd
Hermann returns at stopper.
Juniors Watson Barnes and John
Templeton and sophomore Mark
Millar, Tom Peters, Jim Sloan
and Jim Tucker will all be trying
to gain one of the two open spots
at the wing position.

Senior Jay Werner, who
recorded five shutouts and had a
1.23 goals against average,
returns to mind the nets and is
expected to have an excellent

year. Sophomore Mac Gibson
will provide the backup.

The midfield positions should
be the team’s strongest asset,
with five experienced mid-
fielders coming back. The

veteran midfield group consists.

of seniors Sullivan, Gary
Clements and Jeff Reichert,
junior Keith Scott and
sophomore Tem Myers, with
sophomore Tommy Pee also ex-
pected to see a lot of action this
year.

The Generals lost the talent of
Simon at forward but are sure
they have quality players who
can fill the gap. Junior Bill
Holmes, the third captain,
scored five goals and had seven
assists in 1983 and should be the
most prominent forward this
year. Juniors Eric Obeck and
David Eckardt and sophomores
Hank Greenberg, Ken Randby
and Corky Parkinson should also
contend for playing time.

The incoming freshmen will
also provide team strength.
“The freshman class lacks in
numbers, but makes up for it
with some excellent quality,”
Piranian said.

“This team has great depth,”
Sullivan agreed. ‘‘There are no
weak links and everyone must
contribute.”

Whether this holds true will be
seen on Saturday and Sunday
when the Generals open their
season at the Emory University
Tournament. Included with

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball Generals combined a
balanced running attack with a
stubborn defense and an ex-
cellent kicking game to turn
back the Dickinson Red Devils
36-7 in the opening game of the
1984 season.

The Generals were in control
throughout the contest, allowing
Dickinson just 133 yards of total

offense. The Red Devils’ lone |

score came late in the second
quarter after they recovered a
fumbled punt in W&L territory.

The Generals. were effective
on offense Saturday. Led by
senior tailback Gene Girard’s 81
yards and two touchdowns on 25
carries, W&L stuck primarily to
ground, churning out 215 total
yards rushing. Fullback Frank
Surface (75 yards on 14 carries)
helped keep the Dickinson
defense off balance with his
charges up the middle.

W&L got on the scoreboard
first when James White booted a
36-yard field goal in the first
quarter. Early in the second
quarter, quarterback Bobby
Wilson scored on a 14-yard run,
and Girard added a 3-yard
touchdown run, giving the
Generals a 17-0 lead.

White kicked his second field
goal of the game later in the
quarter, this one coming from 44
yards and tying a school record
of 44 yards set in 1978 by Randy
Austin. Dickinson scored its only
touchdown after White’s kick,
leaving the Generals with a 20-7
halftime lead.

In the second half, the
Generals quickly eliminated any

hope of a Dickinson comeback.
Wilson, who finished the day
with 70 yards passing, scored his
second touchdown of the day on
a -yard keeper, extending
W&L’s lead to 27-7. The Generals
added two more points to the
lead after an errant Dickinson
snap on a punt attempt sailed out
of the'end zone for a safety.

Girard tallied his second score
of the day in the fourth quarter
on a 3-yard plunge, making the
final score 36-7.

W&L Coach Gary Fallon said
he was pleased with his team’s
performance and could find no
real weaknesses based on Satur-
day’s play.

“We executed well in many
areas, which is crucial, especial-
ly in the first game,’ Fallon
said. ‘The defense played well,
the offense scored when we
needed it and the kicking and
punting teams were outstand-
ing.”

Fallon does believe that his

‘team must improve from its first
performance if it is to defeat
Emory & Henry this Saturday.

“We must improve in some
areas if we are to win this Satur-
day,” he added. “Emory &
Henry is an aggressive, well-
coached team with a lot of retur-
ning veterans.”’

The game, which will be
played at Wilson Field, is the
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest for both teams.
E&H opened its season by
defeating Centre 19-14 last Satur-
day.

“It is an important ODAC
game for both of us,” Fallon
said, ‘‘so I know they will be
ready to play.”’

A closer look at Connors-McEnroe

TIME OUT

 

By Mike Stachura

... saturday
was probably
the greatest
day of tennis
many of us will
ever see. But
by now that is
rather obvious,

  

 

 

~ and, 1 think,

 

rather trivial. What is worthy of
comment is something that, un-
fortunately, stuck out like a sore
thumb despite the skyrocketing
level of play. Specifically, I am
referring to the Connors-
McEnroe semifinal, a five-setter
filled with spectacular shotmak-
ing and great emotion from both
sides of the net. But these virtues
of the match were overshadowed
by the distasteful lack of sport-
smanship and the general mis-
behavior of Connors and
McEnroe.

The power of _ television

Remillard

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

 

Head water polo coach Page
Remillard and his team have
labeled their coming season as
“The Miracle of 1984.”

“That’s what it is going to take
to beat Richmond and win the
Southern League this year, a
miracle,” said Remillard.

According to Remillard, the
two-week practice session,
beginning Aug. 27, presented
him with physically conditioned
players, positive attitudes, a
“great” freshman class and new
faces on the varsity squad.

Freshman Eric Sullivan and
Kevin Ledderer, a member of
last year’s B team, are new addi-
tions to the varsity.

Ten players, including All-
American Tim Stanford, from
last year’s 25-12 Southern
League Championship team
return to the 1984 team.
Remillard, however, will miss
several important players from
last year’s squad. All-Americans
Kevin Kadesky and Tim Rock
are lost to graduation, while also
missed will be players from last
year’s team who have decided to
concentrate on their swimming
this fall in preparation for the
swim team’s season this winter.
Notably, sophomore Jay Reville,
who had a successful season as a
freshman on last year’s water
polo team but an even more suc-
cessful season on the swim
team, will not play water polo
this year.

Remillard believes that seim-
mers like Reville who concen-
trate on their swimming instead
of water. polo .will. make a
greater. contribution to the W&L

less the obscenities and the ar-
rogance of the once-and-still-
spoiled brats were there to be
seen and, I hope, served the
same relative purpose as ‘“‘The
Day After” strived for.

Last week I said that athletes
could no longer serve as role
models. What is disturbing is
that the fact is so often proved
true. McEnroe and Connors no
doubt put forth great efforts, but
these efforts were marred by the
less than gentlemanly attitude
displayed by both. Too many
times, a picture of Connors
would flash across the screen
with the 32-year-old child mut-
tering something that would
be more at home in a condemned
barroom. Too often, there would
be McEnroe whining about a call
or a shot that hadn’t turned out
in his favor. This is not accep-
table behavior from someone
who can be so easily idolized. Is
there similar behavior from
other athletes? Certainly, but it
is not seen, and those athletes
know that. McEnroe and Con-
nors acted with a _ careless
disregard for their positions. At

hopes for a

swim program.

Remillard views the 1984
water polo program as one that
needs rebuilding. He said, ‘‘We
will have to start some players
who are low on experience but
high on motivation.” Remillard
said he is unsure how his inex-
perienced players will react toa
foreign face in a pressure situa-
tion.

Remillard also stated that he
will have difficulty replacing
last year’s All-American goalie
Kevin Kadesky. Remillard ex-
pressed concern with the goalie
position which Charlie Groh and
Kevin Davidson are competing
for.

He stated that the goalies are
not contributing the 100 percent
quality time that he requires at
practice. He believes that a ma-
jor question is whether the
goalies can push themselves in
practice.

Remillard cited swimming
ability, physical condition and
the coachability of his players as
his team’s strengths. Remillard
believes that this coachability
will allow his team to improve
during the season. According to
Remillard, his players’ positive
attitudes and willingness to

one point, Connors disagreed
with a linesman’s call, stomped
to the umpire’s chair and told
him in no uncertain terms that
the linesman was to be removed.
Kind of akin to saying, ‘“‘No, Pro-
fessor Hughes, this test is going
to be true-false, not essay.’’ On
another occasion, the two began
to complain about the position of
some photographers situated be-
hind the courtside scoreboard.
When the photographers replied
that it was a spot reserved for
them, Connors resorted to name-
calling and an arrogant attitude
in the vein of, ‘Don’t give me any
lip — head, just leave.’ So much
for the Family Hour. The ques-
tion is, what is to be done? Or
rather, can athletes be effective-
ly disciplined? The answer is
quickly becoming, “No.’’ It is in-
deed sad that people with so
much talent can be so lacking in
other areas. I think the message
is clear: Today’s athlete at once
encompasses everything that
one should strive for (talent and
ability) and everything that one
should seek to avoid (offensive
behavior that is unworthy of

‘miracle’

learn and work hard will help
prepare his team for each
weekend’s competition.

Although Remillard’s team
may not win as many games as
last year’s team, he does not
doubt the overall success of the
1984 water polo campaign.

Remillard said, “We may not
be able to continue our winning
tradition during the rebuilding
year but we will continue the
tradition of having great people
participating in the aquatics pro-
gram.”

This weekend the Generals
host the W&L Fall Classic. The
Generals first will play against
VCU at 5 p.m. on Friday. The
tournament will be played on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday at
Duke, Johns Hopkins, Arkansas,
UNC-Wilmington and Dayton of
Ohio also will participate in the
tournament.

Forcasting the weekend’s
competition, Remillard said,
‘“‘Navy is a runaway and then it’s
anybody’s game.’’ Concerning
his team’s performance this
weekend, Remillard said, ‘‘If we
are going to win one it will be
against VCU. That is the game
that we could most use a
crowd.”

game problem than anything of
serious concern. Coach Gary
Fallon has to pleased with the
confident second half his troops
put in. Pat O’Connell assured
this corner he would be fine for
Saturday’s conference tilt
against Emory & Henry. By the
by, E&H stopped Center
—unimpressively — in the first
contest. This one should be an
acid test for the season of
’84....0ther W&L sports to begin
campaigns this weekend include
soccer and water polo. Coach
Rolf Piranian is quite confident
his charges can play with the na-
tion’s best in Division III, as the

schedule includes such notables
as Emory (this weekend), Mes-
siah and UNC-Greensboro (1983
National Champions). Generals
are rated 5th in the Mid-Atlantic
region preseason poll. If the
team can perform like it did in
victories last year, and goalie
Jay Werner can rise to the occa-
sion when needed —and I think
he can — one would be foolish to
dispute Piranian’s claims....In
polo, it may be once more with
feeling as Remillard’s hard
working polo players go looking
for SL title No. 4 in a row. They
again lose some key people.
(The triumvirate of polo power,
Smith, Ravencraft and Rock, is
gone.) But Remillard feels
talent is there. Suggestion: Take
some time this weekend and
check out the goings on in
Twombly. You won’t be disap-
pointed....A tip of the cap to

Dennis on being named to the
hoops staff at GWU...

....A final thought: They have
resurfaced the foot-bridge tennis
courts. At least the B of T did
something right this summer.....
