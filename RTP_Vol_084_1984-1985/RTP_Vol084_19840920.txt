Bail request by
Fiji fire suspect
denied by judge

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

The man indicted for arson and murder in con-
nection with last spring’s Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity house fire was denied a reduction in his
$150,000 bail yesterday.

Scot Tanner Mesner, a 19-year-old resident of
Hollins College, has been held at the Rockbridge
County Jail since his indictment by a grand jury
Sept. 4.

Following two hours of testimony by five
witnesses, Rockbridge Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III concluded that “‘the bond that
has been set in this matter is a proper bond.”
Mesner did not testify.

Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’
Read had requested that bond be denied
altogether because of Mesner’s “prior criminal
conviction and propensity to set fires, which con-
stitutes a danger to himself and to society,”
according to a motion filed with the court.

G. Marshall Mundy of Roanoke, who in conjunc-
tion with Eric L. Sisler of Lexington is
representing Mesner, argued that his client was
the son of “responsible, good, law-abiding
citizens” and that his release would pose no
“unreasonable danger to himself or the public.”

From the moment Mesner entered the cour-
troom wearing a blue blazer, khakis and Top-
siders until the time he left the chambers to return
to jail, the blond youngster impassively watched
the activity around him, saying little and display-
ing no emotion.

Mesner, the son of two Hollins College pro-
fessors, is currently on a one-year probation for a
previous arson-related conviction.

On Oct. 22, Mesner was charged with three

Moanin’? isa?

Four years ago, Lisa Birnbach
gave birth to ‘‘The Official Prep-
py Handbook,” in which she
discussed ‘‘sarcasm” as one of
seven notably preppy attitudes.
“If a colleague is wearing a
short-sleeved shirt with the
Table of Elements depicted on
the back,” she sniffed, ‘‘it would
be absolutely appropriate to
comment, ‘Nice shirt.’ ’’ Equal-
ly apt, she added, would be
“* ‘Nice girlfriend.’ ”

Now she has emitted a second
volume, “Lisa Birnbach’s Col-
lege Book.”

Nice book, Lisa.

Employing a clever combina-
tion of context-free quotations,
outlandish exaggerations and
damaging omissions, Miss Birn-
bach has savaged Washington
and Lee in a book that likely will
become the “‘in’’ item among
trendy high schoolers in search
of a college.

Turning to the W&L entry,
they will find the description of a
school populated with self-cen-
tered, classless louts. The type
of student W&L hopes to attract
is likely to grimace, hold his (or
her!) nose and quickly look
elsewhere.

Miss Birnbach’s tirade is easi-
ly dismissed, if for no other
reason than because of the mul-
titude of errors that riddle the
book. Sweet Briar becomes
“Sweet Brior’’; V.M.I.’s Ring
Figure ball becomes, of all
things, the “Ring Finger’; the
drinking age here becomes 18 in-
stead of 19 (congratulations,
freshmen! ); and a ‘‘Girls in the

Hay’’ banner becomes ‘‘a
popular bumpersticker.”
In last night’s (this morning’s)

“Late Night with David Letter-
man,”’ Miss Birnbach shared’
that through her scrupulous
research she had learned that
Robert E. Lee founded V.M.I.

bach joshed that a ‘‘typographi-
cal error” in the book made it
appear as though she had rated
Indiana University as having the
nation’s ugliest collegiate males,
when she actually meant to so
designate a school in Penn-
sylvania. Miss Birnbach is
laughing about it; the folks at In-
diana U. likely are not.

Neither are we. After perusing
Miss Birnbach’s glowing de-
scriptions of the cuddly critters
over at Hampden-Sydney and
the devoted denizens of V.M.I.,
we are at a loss to imagine how
she can come to the Collonade
and find nothing but neander-
thals and narcissists.

Do we protest too much? Bear-
ing in mind that it’s the bitten
dog that barks the loudest, are
we attacking poor Miss Birn-
bach to avoid accepting her
harsh assessment of W&L?

We think not. If the honor
system, which she fails to even
mention, is not an integral part
of life here, what is? Do we
“abuse women,”’ or do they al-
low themselves to be abused? (It
takes two to tangle, you know.)
Are minorities ‘‘suppressed,”’ or
do they purposely avoid the cam-
pus mainstream? Is it true that
“there are no women here,”’ or is
the person who said that a social
misfit?

To us, Washington and Lee is
more than button downs, illicit
sex and male chauvinism.

We challenge Miss Birnbach to
return to campus to find out
what General Lee’s College is

’ really like. Lunch is on us.

“This book,’’ she writes in the
Introduction, ‘‘should make you
laugh, make you wince, get you
excited and agitated, and make
you think what a truly insightful
writer Iam.”

has spoken. We invite her to take
her penny loafer out of her

First, let us address the case
that received so much notoriety
in last week’s Phi — namely, the
man’s mistreatment of women.
It’s easy to envision: just tilt
your chair back ard think of
young ladies, —some outgoing,
some not; some attractive and
many less so voluntarily yet
bravely subjecting themselves
to a throbbing mass of predic-
tably sauced men _ that
characterize W&L social events.

It is here that, although one
may attempt to deny it, women
are sometimes targets of foul
language, sexual harassment
and other acts of overt rudeness.
Enhanced by a few cups of warm
keg beer, which in its own right
can make the most religious turn
sour, emotions and judgment
are distorted.

Basically, most incidents of
alleged mistreatment fall into
three categories. Number 1: The

General thought

To the Editors:

This morning I read a newslet-
ter (?) on the bulletin board in
Newcomb Hall called ‘The
Unknown General.”’ I had hoped,
rather foolishly I suppose, that
we would not have to deal with
such garbage this year. But
since it was marked vol. 1, no.1, I
suppose that we may expect to
see such litter about our campus
for the rest of the year.

For those of you fortunate
enough to have missed ‘‘The
Unknown General,’’ it bemoans
the fact that W&L has gone coed
and explains, in extremely inept
comparisons, why such action
should not have been taken. For
now I will pass over the unfound-
ed and ungentlemanly (I have a

feeling we will all soon be sick of
that tar-baby-like word) attack
upon President Wilson’s charac-
ter. He is far more eloquent than
I and has no need of my defense.
I will likewise pass over the inac-
curacies regarding past and pre-
sent admission statistics; one
only needs to walk to the second
floor of Washington Hall to get
the real figures. What needs to
be addressed is what General
Lee would have thought of such a
publication as ‘‘The Unknown
Soldier.” I think I am correct in
saying that he would be sicken-

General Lee is widely known
for having worked to heal the
wounds caused by the Civil War.

identity, an identity shaped by
the peculiarities of the school’s
development. One aspect attrac-
ting much interest is that of the
concept of the ‘‘Washington and
Lee gentleman.’’ We try to de-
cide what this means to us and
how to apply it to the particulars
of mundane life. This idea,
though it is hardly clear now,
has evolved over time through
complicated stages. It seems
that we must now decide, in light
of what confronts us, whether we
shall redefine this idea or hold to
a static notion of who shall be a
“gentleman.”

The ideal of the W&L gentle-
man has existed since at least
the late nineteenth century. It
had its basis in a concept of the
gentleman developed from early
times, and, as Philip Mason
shows in his book ‘‘The English
Gentleman,” is exemplified in
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Thacke-
ray, Dickens, Trollope and
Waugh in literature, as well as in
painting music and other expres-
sions of the genius of man. As
Mason said, ‘‘No one was quite
sure who was a gentleman and
who was not.”

It was hard to decide what was
a gentleman, and various no-
tions of this person existed side
by side and at different times.
Some considered that a gentle-
man could only be in a certain
class into which he was born,
while others would allow that
three generations were suffi-
cient to create a gentleman from
new money. Since this country
began as a middle-class venture,
Americans have ostensibly
valued merit more than birth.
While various aspects of the idea
changed when it was brought
from England, certain values of
gentlemanliness were retained.
I think I may fairly add courage
and foresight to General Lee’s
values of honesty, fairness and
respect for private property,
which traditionally come to con-
stitute gentlemanliness to us.

Men who valued these ideals,
among other things, formed
brotherhoods for their preserva-
tion and propagation. These
fraternities were formed of like-
minded men pledged to their
ideals and to each other. They
only admitted those considered
worthy, but, once admitted, one
could expect to be treated as a

John W. Elrod, Washington
and Lee’s recently installed
dean of the college, is swiftly
familiarizing himself with W&L
faculty, students and curricu-
lum, while making plans for
enabling the university to turn
out the “‘ideal’’ student.

Although : the former Iowa
State philosophy department
head has only been in Lexington
since August, Elrod said he is
beginning to realize the all-
‘encompassing capabilities of
W&L gentlemen.

“The overall quality of the stu-
dent body at W&L is higher than
the overall quality of the student
body at Iowa State University,’’
Elrod said.

A highly respected authority
on Danish philosopher Soren

 

s¥yusvyyrya

Aaybe Kierkegard, Elrod’s phil-
osophically oriented approach to
the ideal administration and stu-
dent is extremely evident.

“The goal that we have before
us always is introducing stu-
dents into an appreciation of the
life of the mind — helping them
to see how the life of the mind is
connected to living a good life,
and making sure that we have
the kind of faculty we need in
order to accomplish that goal,”
Elrod observed

Elrod said he sets his sights
for W&L high, and part of ac-

complishing his goals is what he
termed his ‘faculty develop-
ment program.”

“We have a faculty that’s

_ highly tenured,” he said. “‘We’re

a middle-aged faculty. We’ve got
a lot of good people here, and one
of the things we want to concen-
trate on, since we’re not going to

be bringing in a lot of new people
any time soon, is figuring out
ways to help them get away
from the University, to go other
places and teach.”’

“‘We want to keep the faculty
invigorated and give them an op-
portunity to be stimulated in
their thinking and their research
and writing,” he continued.

“The way we have to do that, I
think, is to give people an oppor-
tunity to get away, so I’m going
to encourage people to take sab-
baticals and encourage people to
find faculty members in another
part of the country who would
exchange positions with them.”’

“Students are worried about
getting jobs and worried about
getting into graduate school,”’ he
said. ‘‘So often those career wor-
ries or job worries interfere with
coming to appreciate and under-
stand what the life of the mind is

mistreated. Number 2: The
young lady is a quick thinker and
rather than trying to duel with
her using his pickled brain, the
man chooses to ignore her, and
thus she feels as if she is the vic-
tim of unfriendly behavior.
Otherwise, the drunken male
senses defeat or inferiority and
lashes out with a string of four-
letter words that make Scarface
look like Snow White. She is
mistreated. In the third scenar-
io, some amorous male decides
to sow a few wild oats and grabs
a female flank. This, again, con-
stitutes mistreatment, and is
possibly something to get upset
about, but these occasions are
about as frequent as cold keg
beer.

Now, out of fairness, we must
present that ideal situation
which is easily recognized on the
streets of Lexington or, in its
budding stages, off to one side of
the fraternity house dance floor.
Bleary-eyed looks, induced by
love, lust, drunkenness or lack of
sleep, the courageous parting
with one’s smoke-permeated,
beer-drenched jean jacket to
keep their beloved warm on
those cold Virginia evenings (or

mornings); a girl’s sweet voice
charming her man’s car keys
away. Those are just a few of the

characteristics of the ideal
hookup.
This’ situation fosters

weekends of monogamous felici-
ty; the certainty of the compan-
ionship of the opposite sex; at
least in most cases, a guaran-
teed place to stay; as well as
other benefits. These har-
monious relationships come and
go, heartbreaks are inevitable,
marriages are improbable and
pregnancies undesirable, but at
any rate, an air of justice
prevails.

Out of duty to accuracy more
than desire, we must present
another of those unfortunate
cases — female abuse of males.
Whether your eyebrows raise in
skepticism, satisfaction enters
your brain at having ‘‘them”’
blamed for once, or your heart
quickened with expectancy at
the reassurance that there have
been others like yourself, it is all
the same sad fact.

Let us consider this hy-
pothetical but not uncommon set
of circumstances. A_ girl

He never allowed an unkind
word toward General Grant to
be spoken in his presence.
Likewise, he deplored the idea
expressed in the phrase, ‘‘The
South will rise again!”’ He was a
man to let bygones be bygones.
Although it is uncertain as to
whether Lee would support
coeducation, it seems certain
that after such a decision had
already been made, he would
have supported it and worked to
make the transition as easy as
possible.

Consider also ‘‘The Unknown
General’s”’ last sentence: ‘‘The

 

best reaction was given by
Robert E. Lee after Pickett’s
Charge when he whispered ‘Too
bad, too bad, oh, too bad!!’”’
The sentence is written so as to
make the reader believe that
this is Lee’s reaction to coeduca-
tion rather than to the destruc-
tion of a division 15,000 strong. It
offends one’s intellect to read a
comment so obviously taken out
of context.

Mr. Unknown Soldier, please
do not subject us to this garbage
all year long. This university
will need the full support of its
students, alumni, faculty, ad-
ministration, and staff in the
coming year. It does not need

motivations and objectives. She
drinks a fraternity’s beer,
vomits on their floor, leaves
them to clean it up and blames
them for encouraging her to
drink so much so they may take
advantage of her.

Or what about the hordes of
Savage women that desend upon
any W&L man in hopes of getting
that Fancy Dress bid? They’ll
even chase a red head’s step-
child to get a chance at showing
their face at that annual fiesta.
The elusive M.r.s., more uncom-
mon today than in previous
years, provides a perfect set-up
for the male to get scammed. It
goes something like this: boy
meets girl; boy invites girl to
parties; and just when things
look good, boy picks up girl in an
Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser sta-
tion wagon with wood paneling,
luggage rack and AM tunes.
Poor boy bites the big one.

Inconsiderate men exist here
at W&L, at VMI, at Hampden-
Sydney, in all colleges, and, yes,
in the real world. The same is
true of the women at S.B.C.,
M.B.C., H.C. and R.-M.W.C.,
S.S. and the entire female
population in general. For we all
are subject to the same weak-
ness — intergender inconsidera-
tion and even abuse at times.

as one. These high ideals were
associated, by tradition, with the
male gender. This association
was sometimes rigid. Emman-
uel Skikaneder, Mozart’s libret-
tist for his fraternal opera ‘‘The
Magic Flute,” wrote of a manly
brotherhood, where the very
presence of women profanes its
holy temple, for the ‘‘tittle tattle
of women (is) made up of lies.’’

Ideas change, especially ones
which are variously defined. The
evolution of the constitutional
structure of England is a good
example of this, resulting in the
extension of the franchise, show-
ing the evolution of the idea of
who is fit to govern. Both the
ideals of gentleman and fraterni-
ty might be considered in this
way.

Perhaps General Lee meant
his school to be one large frater-
nal body. In his time that body
was much more homogeneous
than it is today. It had to accept
successively its first non-Pres-
byterian, its first man from
below the middle class and its

we want to engender in our
students.

‘“‘We want to put somebody out
into society who’s got a mind,
and a tongue, and a pen that will
help them face a world that we
really can’t prepare them for,”’
he continued.

“We want to put people into
the world not with knowledge
and not with information, but

Texan!). Lee must have meant
his ideals to continue to be
valued despite these particular
changes and for the ‘‘fraternal’’
body to accept, and assimilate,
new “gentlemen.”

Now it seems we are presented
with another change. Through-
out its past men of this school
have responded in a manner con-
sistent with their professed
ideals. Shall we be manly
enough to follow their example
now? Shall we accept these
ladies as ‘‘brothers’’ and
“gentlemen,” or shall we treat
them as unwelcome coeds? Per-
haps our own identity is at stake
in this decision. Unlike some
cultures, Britain’s has kept
much of what was good in the
aristocratic order despite the
growing power of the middle
class. It has done this through
the wisdom of its better men,
who had faith in themselves and
their ideals. We must show faith,
so that our ideals will be worth
accepting and our identity not
lost. By being honest to our own
code, we can perhaps keep this,
in the true sense, always a
“‘gentleman’s college.”’

A letter from Murphy to fra-

meant to be in good humor.

She said a large part of her
essay deals with coeducation
because “I was a little unhap-
py at the anti-coed feelings of
the students, which were very
strong and very well expressed
to me last year when I visited. ”

The W&L students who par-
ticipated in the interview said
they were disappointed that
Ms. Birnbach expressed only
one side of student opinion on
the coeducation issue and that
she didn’t make any reference
to the W&L honor system.

“I remember specifically
what was said, and I remem-
ber specifically who said it,
and ... she kind of picked and
chose what she wanted to use,”
said John Cleghorn, chief
editor of The Ring-tum Phi last
year.

“I think we said some things
that she didn’t put in there,’
Cleghorn said. ‘‘I think she had
the notes and asked the right
questions to get a good inter-
view. She chose not to use
them.”’

Ms. Birnbach, who gradu-

7 ated from Brown in 1978, had

“a pretty good fix on what
W&L was going to be like and
she let us know she didn’t think
much of the atmosphere,”’ said
Steve Lewis, co-chairman of
the 1984 Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

“She obviously had this pre-
conceived notion of what she
wrote about. I don’t think it’s
anywhere near accurate,”’
Lewis said. ‘I really don’t
know where she came up with
all those stereotypes about
what she wanted W&L to be
like.’”’

Bob Jenevein, last year’s
student body president, said

that in the interview, ‘‘Nobody
had too many bad things to
say...She could’ve painted a
more realistic picture.”’

A discussion of the W&L
honor system evolved into talk
about Lee, the students said.
“‘He’s a god,’’ she quoted one
student as saying. ‘‘We call
him St. Bob.”

Ms. Birnbach, who said she’d
expected W&L to be ‘‘preppy
heaven,”’ added that the stu-
dents’ fascination with Lee sur-
prised her. ‘‘I didn’t realize it
was going to be an academic
shrine to Robert E. Lee,’’ she
said.

She did not mention the
honor system, however, be-
cause, “I just had to make
choices. There’s only so much
that you can say about a
school. I was limited by
space.”’

During the October inter-
view, the honor system ‘‘was
discussed pretty much, and we
all agreed it worked,’ said
Marty Bechtold, 4 dorm coun-
selor who graduated in May.

The only part that made him
upset, Bechtold said, was the
listing, ‘‘Academic Pressure:
‘Ha, Ha, Ha, (sarcastic
laughter) .’ I totally disagree
with that,’’ he added. ‘‘That’s
totally ridiculous.”

None of the students inter-
viewed recalled remarks dur-
ing the interview quoted in the
book about academic pressure,
favorite school tradition (’’Go-
ing down the road — a bunch of
guys get drunk, pile into a car
and set out to abuse girls at a
chosen girl’s school’’), or worst
things about the school (‘It’s
too conservative; no women;
lots of rich, preppy assholes.”’)

Pete Cronin, editor of the

Calyx last year, said that
although Ms. Birnbach was in-
telligent, he was wary of her.

“T’d say she obviously had a
preconceived notion before she
ever showed up,’’ Cronin con-
tinued. “She thought W&L is
full of a bunch of rich, white,
right-wing, upper middle class,
chauvinistic men. Everything
bad you could ever say about
W&L she has said; I don’t think
she’s said any of the good
stuff.’’

Ms. Birnbach seemed im-
pressed with the campus and
the class she visited, Chapman
said. However, he said, ‘‘there
was a good deal of controver-
sy’’ during the interview.

“She was prodding Bob
(Jenevein) a little bit, and he
gave back as good as he got,”
he said. “But she did seem a
little bit startled at the depth of
his views, how firmly he held
his convictions.’’

The essay part of the review,
Chapman added, ‘‘was Bob
Jenevein’s vision of
Washington and Lee.”’ Many of
the quotes came from Jene-
vein, he said.

Chapman said the interview
evolved into ‘‘polite debate,
that sometimes wasn’t so
polite,’ both between the
students and Ms. Birnbach and

among the students.

Cronin concluded that the ar-
ticle is neither fair nor ac-
curate:

“I think she presented a
slanted view, and hence a view
that was not accurate and it’s
too bad that there are people
who are going to read this and
come away with a precon-
ceived notion about a Washing-
ton and Lee that doesn’t exist
as she presented it.”’

The Student Bar Association
will keep 83 percent of Law
School student taxes this year,
representatives of the Executive
Committee and the SBA decided
Thursday.

SBA President John Sicilian
said he thinks 83 percent is a
good figure. He added that the
difference between 80 percent
and 83 percent is about $400 or
$500, which he called a sum not
worth arguing about.

“With the $5 (student tax) in-
crease, I think we can make it on
that,” Sicilian said.

EC Vice President James
White, chairman of the EC’s
finance subcommittee, said SBA
representatives were unsure
whether 80 percent would be a
sufficient figure. He had said
before the meeting that he ex-
pected this year’s percentage to
be between 80 and 82 percent.

White noted that the EC re-
serve fund is available if the
SBA needs more money. ‘‘They
can still come back at the end of
the year if that 83 percent
doesn’t cut it,’’ he said.

If 83 percent is sufficient this
year, Sicilian said the SBA will
ask the EC to pass a resolution
keeping the same percentage

SBA, EC agree
on tax percentage

each year.

“It’s silly to start every year
fighting about it,” he said. ‘‘It’s
not that much money.”

White said Sicilian and the
other SBA officers have been
‘“‘very cooperative” throughout
the negotiating process.

“I think they’ll (SBA) be hap-
py with it and I know they’ll be
glad to govern their own funds,”
White said. ‘‘I think it’s going to
be a whole lot easier this way.”’

This year marks the first time
that the SBA has been autono-
mous from the EC. In past years
the EC has allocated funds to the
SBA as if it were a student
organization rather than as a
student government.

Based on the total of 367 law
students who matriculated, the
total amount of law school taxes
will be $27,525, 83 percent of
which is $22,845.75. That means
$4,679.25 of law student taxes
will go to the EC this year.

Law students pay a $120 stu-
dent activities fee; $25 goes
directly to funding the building
of the student activities pavilion
and $20 goes directly to the SBA.
Undergraduates pay $100 in ac-
tivity fees, $25 of which goes to
the pavilion.

Sicilian said the SBA will
begin approving requests for
funds from law school organiza-
tions within the next two weeks.

 

White Book in error?

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Confusion over a sentence in
the White Book arose in the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting
Monday night, when represen-
tatives Bob Tomaso and Andrew
Caruthers announced that there
is a change in this year’s White
Book that was not approved by
the EC last year.

The sentence says that a stu-
dent who is found guilty in either
a closed hearing or in an appeal
in an open hearing will have the
phrase ‘‘not in good standing’
stamped on his official tran-
script when he is expelled.

“The only way that should be
in there,”’ Caruthers said, ‘‘is if
we voted on it. In a sense, that
amendment is not really approv-
ed.”’

After a moment of confusion,
EC President Cole Dawson ex-
plained that he added the sen-
tence himself after a conversa-
tion with University Registrar
Harold Head.

“T talked to Col. Head, and he
said it should say ‘expelled’

Dawson explained, adding that
he wasn’t sure it was in the EC’s
power to make decisions about
what a student’s transcript says.

“It was not passed last year,”
Dawson said, ‘‘but I added it
when I sent (the White Book) to
(EC Secretary) Sam (Dalton) to
be typed up.”

Last year’s EC approved ad-
ding the bdd-standing clause on-
ly for students who appealed a
closed-hearing guilty verdict
and were then found guilty in the
open hearing.

This would deter a student who
knew he was guilty from appeal-
ing, Caruthers said last night.

“The way it’s in there now,
there is no deterrence to appeal-

ing,’’ Caruthers. said.
“Everybody’s going to go to the
open trial.”

Last year three of the four
students who appealed their
closed-hearing verdicts were
found innocent in the open trial.

Caruthers made a motion to
strike the sentence from the
White Book ‘“‘pending the EC’s
decision in two weeks.’’ The mo-
tion passed unanimously.

The Student Association for
Black Unity will not request any
funds from the Executive Com-
mittee this year, SABU Presi-
dent Bryan Johnson said Tues-
day.

Neither Johnson nor Director
of Minority Affairs John L.
White had any comment as to
where SABU’s funds for this
year would come from.

EC Secretary Sam Dalton said
that he thought one of the
reasons SABU didn’t request
money might be that the group
thought it had been treated poor-
ly in the budgeting process in
previous years. Last year SABU
requested $5,100 but received on-
ly $1,500 from the EC.

Dalton said that when he talk-

W&L this term.

Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Monday in the quads of

SABU won’t request

Brunson about why the group did
not submit a budget request
Monday night, Brunson said, ‘“‘I
don’t think we’re going to ask for

nual ball at a cost of over $10,000
and at an estimated loss of over
$5,000.

Then-President Ron Magee
said after the ball that he
thought SABU’s budget was in
the red.

“We took a beating and it will
have repercussions on our future

activities,” Magee said at the
time.

dent organizations. Budget re-
quests totalling $111,537.90 have

New dormitory being planned for 1987-88

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Planning is underway for the
addition of a new dormitory for
Washington and Lee, with com-
pletion of the facility scheduled
for the fall of 1987.

The residential study commit-
tee will be chaired by Frank
Parsons, assistant to the univer-
sity president, and will report to
the new Coeducation Steering
Committee.

“We want to come up with
solutions that meet the greatest
need,”’ Parsons said. ‘‘Any deci-
sion we make will be subject to
criticism from one group or
another. We’ve got a real task
before us.”

Parsons estimated that with
the planning time and an 18-
month construction period the
most likely date for the opening
of a new dormitory would be
September 1987.

“It’s conceivable if everything
falls into place we could have
housing in place by 1986,” he
said. “I think that would be
rushing things unnecessarily.
Unless there is a compelling
reason why we should make a
crash study, we’ll go with ’87-
88.”’

Parsons added that he still
needs to clarify some of the
guidelines of the project with,
Associate Dean of the College,
Pamela Simpson and President
John D. Wilson, and the commit-
tee’s decisions would be review-

ed by committees of the Board of
Trustees.

Parsons said it was premature
to speculate what form the new
housing would take.

“We have to create housing
that is attractive, functional and
that students will want to rent,”’
noted Parsons.

Parsons did discuss some of
the options and issues that the
committee might consider while
planning for the additional hous-
ing.

Parsons said the university
has several locations available
for new housing. One possible
site is on a tract of university-
owned land west of U.S. 60 near
the old railroad station. Other
possibilities are to extend the
Woods Creek housing to the
other side of the footbridge or to
add another wing to Graham-
Lees Dormitory in order to com-
pletely enclose the freshman
quad, Parsons added.

“At the moment there isn’t
any clear direction as to the kind
of housing or the number of beds

we would provide,’ said Par- .

sons.

Parsons said the committee
could decide to make the new
housing a traditional-style dor-
mitory or something similar to
the Woods Creek Apartments, or
a style somewhere between
those two.

One popular trend in dormi-
tory housing, according to Par-
sons, is ‘‘living and learning.”
This type of dormitory is ‘‘more
than just a place to sleep and

study,’’ Parsons said. Lounges,
a browsing library, seminar
rooms for classes and other
‘“‘commons’’ areas are often in-
cluded in ‘‘living and learning”
dormitories, added Parsons.

Parsons said he feels the
university as a whole needs an
improved ‘‘commons’’ area
where students can congregate.
The main commons area on the
campus now is the Co-op, which
frequently is overcrowded, Par-
sons said.

Regardless of what form the
additional housing takes, both
freshmen and upperclassmen
will be able to live in it, Parsons
said. Although the building of the
Woods Creek Apartments
several years ago temporarily
alleviated student demand for
on-campus housing, the increase
in the size of the Law School once

again has resulted in a housing
shortage, Parsons said.

“T really think that there ought
to be more opportunity to live on
campus,’’ he added.

Whether the dormitory will be
single-sex, coed with men and
women on separate floors or co-
ed with men and women in dif-
ferent rooms on the same floor
will be considered by the com-
mittee.

“One of the simplest options
Would be to designate one dorm
over there as the women’s
dorm,” said Parsons.

“The women might not like
that. I think we might find
quicker dissatisfaction with just
a women’s dorm. We would go
that way if the entering women
expressed a preference for
that,”’ remarked Parsons.

Parsons conducted a survey of

W&L men’s opinions regarding
single sex and coed dormitories
during matriculation, but the
results have not been tabulated.

The committee would also
have to consider what additional
security measures would be
needed to protect women in the
dormitories from intruders.

“We've learned a lot from our
female law students,” Parsons
said.

Parsons explained that when
women first entered the Law
School they pointed out that the
walk across the footbridge was
unlighted and dangerous. In
response, the University added a
number of lights along the sides
of the bridge, Parsons said.

The University also will try to
improve the lighting in some of
the darker areas of the campus
before next year, Parsons said.

Wilson names Dean Simpson
to head coeducation committee

Pamela H. Simpson, associate
dean of the College at Washing-
ton and Lee, has been appointed

chairperson of the
university’s Coeducation Steer-
ing Committee.

Appointed by Washington and
Lee President John D. Wilson,
the 13-member committee has
been asked to provide the uni-
versity community with sugges-
tions on all matters associated
with the decision to admit
women in the fall of 1985.

In his charge to the commit-
tee, Wilson said the group’s
main work ‘‘will be to ensure the
happy and successful induction
of young women into our col-
legiate life by anticipating new
opportunities we should seize
upon and potential problems we
should avoid if we can.”’

He added that the committee
will be encouraged ‘‘to use the
experience of other institutions
of our size and character which
have undertaken — similar
changes.”’

Ms. Simpson said that the
committee met last Thursday
and plans to meet weekly.

She said the committee talked
about Wilson’s memo that outlin-
ed what its agenda should be and
provided a series of planning
assumptions within which it will
work.

Those assumptions include a
10-year initial planning period
during which the size of the
undergraduate student body will
increase to about 1,500 students
— 1,000 men and 500 women.

Ms. Simpson said the commit-
tee will meet today with the ad-
missions office to begin studying
admissions policies and pro-
cedures.

In his memo to the committee,
Wilson noted that the committee
should anticipate the need to in-
crease the residential capacity
but should not adopt a policy that
mandates on-campus residence
beyond the freshman year.

Further, the president made
specific reference to adopting a
strong program of athletics for
women “‘to parallel, in appropri-
iate ways, our program for

A “termless” academic calen-
dar of five six-week units enabl-
ing professors to schedule com-
binations of courses varying
from three to 18 weeks in length
has been proposed by a Washing-
ton and Lee psychology pro-
fessor.

felony arson counts in connec-
tion with several small, early-
morning fires at the dormitory
in which he was living at
Fairleigh Dickinson University
in Teaneck, N.J.

As a result of a plea agree-
ment, Mesner on May 15 pleaded
guilty in Bergen County
Municipal Court to one misde-
meanor count of criminal
mischief, according to testimony
yesterday.

Teaneck Police Chief Bryan
Burke said Mesner was given a
30-day suspended jail sentence
and fined $1,000. Through an in-
terstate agreement, Mesner has
been allowed to report to a
Roanoke probation officer. He
was living with his parents on
the Hollins campus at the time of
his arrest on the Lexington
charges.

Mesner’s father, 39-year-old
Thomas H. Mesner, testified
that if the $150,000 bail were
reduced and his son were releas-
ed, Scot would immediately
begin taking 15 credit hours of
classes' at Virginia Western
Community College in Roanoke.

“We have managed to scrape
together right at $50,000 through
savings and through loans,” said
Mesner, a reference librarian
and history instructor at Hollins.

Mesner, who has round spec-
tacles, a receding hairline and a
diminutive appearance, said ‘‘it
hasn’t been easy for us, going to
the family to ask for money.’’ He
said his parents had been ‘“‘very
generous” in loaning money for
the bond.

The father said that in October
he went to New Jersey to pick up
his son following his arrest on
the arson charges, but that they
had not talked about the allega-
tions.

“We went to see a counselor
about it, and the counselor said
that it was best that we not
discuss it with him and just
move on from there,” he
testified. ‘‘We encouraged him
to seek work, and went on from
there.”’

The elder Mesner confirmed
by telephone that Kaye Lynn
Mesner was his first wife and
Scot’s mother. She was shot to
death on Jan. 10, 1976, in lowa Ci-
ty, Iowa, and Michael Dean
Remmers was later convicted of
premeditated murder in the
case, according to Johnson
County public records.

 

crazy?” are the two responses
professor David G. Elmes said
he has received from faculty
members and administrators
who have seen his idea.

According to Professor John
H. Wise, chairman of the ad hoc
calendar committee, Elmes’ al-
ternative calendar was present-
ed too late for his committee to
consider completely, but was
presented with his committee’s
report to the faculty Executive
Committee Monday.

Mesner’s stepmother, Jeanne
Larsen, an assistant professor of
English at Hollins who has been
married to Mesner’s father for
seven years, said that ‘“‘his
mother is deceased and I’ve
been his full-time mother.”’

Read asked her about the
closeness of her relationship
with Mesner. ‘‘Extremely
close?’’ she asked, smiling and
tossing her head. ‘‘As closely as
suits a 19-year-old....I1 was not
aware of where he was at every
moment.”

On April 13, Mesner was serv-
ed with a “no trespassing”’
notice from the Hollins security
force ‘‘directing him not to place
foot on the Hollins College cam-
pus”~ except for his parents’
house, according to testimony
yesterday.

Arthur Hafdelin, Mesner’s
Roanoke probation officer, said
the order was issued by Hollins
College because ‘‘there’d been
some problems with some coeds
that apparently he had threaten-
ed in some way.”’

“T didn’t ask him why he was
served with that,’’ Ms. Larsen
said. “I felt that was between
Scot and the people at Hollins....I
have some hearsay knowledge,
but I never asked him about
that.”

“Hearsay knowledge?” ex-
claimed Read, addressing the
judge. ‘How in the world can she
come in here and say she proper-
ly supervised her son if she
doesn’t know anything about
him?”’

Robert Lynn, a_ substance
abuse counselor at the South-
west Virginia Treatment Center
in Roanoke, said he treated
Mesner beginning at the end of
May because “he was addicted
to drugs and alcohol.”

Hafdelin testified that if
Mesner were released on bond,
“T would be concerned about the
threat that he could set more
fires....1 have no personal pro-
blems with Scot, but he has a
problem with pyromania and ar-
son.”’

In a statement Mesner made
to New Jersey police on Oct. 22
which was entered as evidence
at the hearing, he admitted that
he had set the dormitory fires
“using a cigarette lighter’’ in
order ‘‘to raise hell and to strike
back, but at what, I don’t know.”

In the remarks to police,
Mesner said that when he was
young he had set a fire on a
metal bridge in Iowa City, Iowa.

“I did not get get along well
with my stepmother, and in
general just disobeyed the fami-

Elmes’ proposal rests upon
five premises: a typical student
will average 10 courses (30 cred-
its) per year; a school year of
more than two terms is desir-
able; the 12-124 calendar is in-
flexible because special courses
and programs are limited to the
spring term and_ unlinked
courses are limited to a duration
of six or 12 weeks; courses differ
in the length required for ade-
quate coverage; and a shortened
Christmas vacation is not de-

ly rules,’ he told police.
“Recently I have felt rather
depressed and oppressed. I am
not sure what I am feeling.’’

Mundy argued that the
Teaneck conviction should not
be a factor in determining bail in
the Lexington case.

“The events that caused his
charge to be reduced from a
felony to a misdemeanor are
something that I’m sure the peo-
ple in New Jersey regret,’’ Read
said. ‘This young man obviously
has a problem with pyromania
and with arson.”

“That’s inflammatory, your
honor,’’ Mundy said, as a wave
of laughter at the unintended
un swept the courtroom.

The Ring-tum Phi, September 20, 1984, Page 7

Proposed ‘termless’ calendar called flexible

sirable.

The proposal calls for an
academic year broken up into
five six-week units, each sep-
arated by at least one week. Ex-
aminations, grading and vaca-
tions would occur during this
week.

Courses could last three, six,
nine, 12, 15, or 18 weeks, accor-
ding to the professors’ desires,
explained Elmes. “In this kind
of scheme, terms have no mean-
ing,” he said.

“It seems to me the program
... We’re in right now is some-
what inflexible. If you want a
one-shot course, you’ve got some
problems,”’ said Elmes, explain-
ing why he designed this pro-
posal. Specific benefits of the
alternative calendar, according
to Elmes, include flexibility of
scheduling for both students and
faculty, and access to internship
programs throughout the year.

“The faculty should be able to
tailor their courses and teaching
load to their own needs and de-
sires,” wrote Elmes in his ex-
planation of the calendar.

Elmes believes that his calen-

dar would benefit weaker stu-
dents who could take a lighter

course load when they had one
difficult or time-consuming
course. The calendar would be-
gin and end “‘at times more con-
gruent with other schools in our
area ... “‘ wrote Elmes in the
proposal.

This calendar would necessi-
tate students’ planning an entire
year’s course load at one time.
“Under a system like this, I’d
think you’d have to,” Elmes
said.

If Elmes’ proposal were ap-
proved, several months of study
would be required, according to
Wise. ‘‘The ball would be back in
their (the calendar commit-
tee’s) court,’’ Elmes said.

Terming his calendar ‘‘a
could-be administrative night-
mare,” Elmes said he has not
tried to solve all of the potential
administrative problems.

“If people thought this had
enough advantages . . . it would
take some time,’’ Elmes said. ‘‘I
want people to think about it.
One of the purposes is getting
people to think about it. One of
the purposes is getting people to
think of alternative ways to set
up the calendar.”’

Cockpit
to rock
Fridays

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Cockpit and WLUR will
embark on a joint venture
tomorrow afternoon — Rock and
Roll Happy Hour. Beginning at 3
p.m., the campus radio station
will broadcast live from the
Cockpit for two hours in what
program director Brian Oliger
calls ‘“‘a great way to unwind for
the weekend.”’

Oliger said the idea of running
a radio show from the Cockpit
came from journalism Professor
Robert J. deMaria and Cockpit
manager Mike Jacoby.

Since this is the first attempt
at broadcasting from the student
bar, planners say all the bugs
have not yet been worked out of
the system.

Take for example, the on-air
talent. Friday’s show will be co-
hosted by Bob Halloran and Cot-
ton Puryear. ‘The thing is,
we’re all pretty clueless,’’ said
Puryear, who will open the show
at3.

“I’m going to walk in there
Friday with a MARTI (remote
transmitter) and a tune list and
wing it.”

Halloran, who is scheduled to

’ be in class at airtime, will join

him later.

Don’t expect to walk into the
Cockpit tomorrow afternoon and
see stacks of records, turntables
and ‘‘cart’’ machines, either. All
the music will be broadcast from
the WLUR studio in Reid Hall,
via the magic of Marconi, with a
little help from a station engi-
neer.

Future plans for the Happy
Hour, which will air every Fri-
day afternoon, include guest
DJ’s from the radio stations at
Sweet Briar and Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College.

Since the purpose of the show
is to broadcast in front of a
crowd, Cockpit patrons will have
an opportunity to be heard on the
radio. Puryear said that he and
Halloran plan to do live inter-
views during the show.

Independent Union
requests EC funds

By ROBERT DORAIS
Staff Reporter

 

The Independent Union, which
was denied funds by the Ex-
ecutive Committee last year,
has requested $1,200 in student
taxes this year in order to ex-
pand its social calendar, chair-
man Chuck Diffenderffer said
this week.

Diffenderffer said the In-
dependent Union plans to sell
permanent memberships that
would admit a student and his
date to IU parties free of charge
this year.

The EC cited the IU’s failure
to charge any kind of dues when
it rejected the IU’s budget re-
quest last year.

Diffenderffer said he hopes the

IU can raise $1,000 from both in-
dividual ticket sales and dues
payments.

The IU’s budget calls for $1,600
to be spent for bands either in
the Cockpit or the new Pavilion,
scheduled to open Oct. 12. Dif-
fenderffer said he would like to
have another ‘‘Saturday Night in
the Pit,” which the IU co-
sponsored with the Student Ac-
tivities Board on Fancy Dress
weekend last year.

The Independent Union offers
students ‘‘the services of a
fraternity without the obliga-
tions” of time and money, Dif-
fenderffer said.

In addition, the IU plans to
organize intramural teams.
Students may sign up at an
organizational meeting Sept. 26
to play intramural tennis and
golf. Independents interested in
playing intramural football
should contact Diffenderffer at
463-3130 by Saturday.

About 50 students attended the
first meeting last year, but at-
tendance dipped after that, Dif-
fenderffer said, because ‘‘it was
really all upin the air.”’

The Independent Union has a
permanent office, Room 205 of
the Student Center, this year,
and both Dean of Students Lewis
G. John and Associate Dean of
Students Michael Cappeto will
serve as advisers.

Another service the IU plans
to offer this year is a cold test
file that students can use either
by paying a fee or by con-
tributing one of their cold tests.
The file will be in the IU’s office.

University Center secretary Carole Chappell tries her phone.

Teaching the teachers

Anyone who’s grappled with
the new university telephone
system knows that when all else
fails (hardly unlikely), you don’t
read the directions. That would
just make it worse.

Instead you talk to Arlene
Black, a Rolm Corp. com-
munications system designer,
who spent two weeks here last
month answering questions
about bugs that professors and
other university staffers had en-
countered in their initial weeks
with their new phones.

Each day she taught several
sessions of 20 people each in a
Commerce School conference
room.

Ms. Black, who did much of
the training when the University
of Virginia installed a similar
system, treats with great humor
the irony of instructing acade-
mics in the seemingly simple
skill of using their desk phones.

“They’ve been very respon-
sive and say ‘Hey, wow’ when
they master a new feature on the
phone,’’ said Ms. Black, who has
worked out of Rolm’s Charlot-
tesville office for three years.

“‘One man came in here saying
that no one needed to teach him
how to use a phone,”’ she recall-
ed. “I told him he was right: if
you want to make a call, you just
pick up the receiver and do it.

The same goes for answering the.

telephone.

“It’s. nothing more than a
telephone,’ I told him, but he
must have been interested in
spite of himself, because he
stayed around to listen to how to
use the other features.”’

“He was probably stewing
because he thought it was
nonsense to come and learn
about a telephone, but at the
same time he was curious
enough to stay,’’ she added.

Ms. Black said she occasional-
ly is asked about the necessity of
some of the phones’ more eso-

teric capabilities.

“You have these features to
make it easier for you to do your
work,”’ she explains patiently.
“They are shortcuts for your
convenience. You may never use
them, but you should know:
they’re there and how to work
them.”’

“Everything’s going toward
computers now, so having a
computerized phone is a big
deal,”’ she added.

She contends that showing
people repeatedly how to use
their “pick” potential’ their
‘“‘camp-on”’ capability or their
‘‘flash’’ function is not as tedious
as it might seem.

“Every group is different and
has different questions,”’ she ex-
plained. ‘You don’t get up there
and read off the instructions like
a robot.

“It takes a certain type of per-
son to train a telephone system
and have the users respond to
it.”

Ms. Black said she uses a com-
bination of slides and ‘“‘hands-
on’ training to make her
trainees comfortable with the
system.

She said she tries to maintain
an attractive yet unobtrusive ap-
pearance so that ‘‘they’re focus-
ing on their telephone and obser-
ving what the phone is like
rather than what I look like.”’

Ms. Black, who went to work
for the company after having
worked for 10 years at a law firm
which had a Rolm system, said
she plans to remain in the
customer service end of the
operation, rather than move to
sales, which is ‘‘where the
money is.”’

“On the support end, I’m doing
something for them,’’ she ex-
plained. “When I’m selling
something, I’m always asking
them to do something for me. I
prefer to be helping them.”’

ERRATIC A NARRE STAN ANE REST RHEE BIRD TIGRE
By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

Although Washington and
Lee’s new computerized tele-
phone system may be confusing,
it will make telephone use more
convenient and cost-efficient, of-
ficials say.

The University’s Central
Telephone Co. of Virginia

‘system was “approaching the

upper limits of its capacity to
serve us,”’ said Frank A. Par-
sons, assistant to the president.

The new ROLM Computerized
Branch Exchange (CBX) sy-
stem, which began service Aug.
1, has many convenience fea-
tures not available on the Centel
system.

Carole Chappell, University
Center secretary, called the
variety of new features on her
21-button telephone “‘very con-
fusing.”

“I have been cutting people
off,’’ she explained, ‘‘including
the dean of the law school at
Yale. However, if I ever figure
this thing out, it will be a fan-
tastic piece of equipment.”

The need for operator-assisted
long distance calling has been
eliminated on most of the sys-
tem’s approximately 460 push-—
button telephones, reducing the
cost of such calls by 25 to 30 per-
cent. Also, the system’s “‘least
cost routing” capability insures
the most economical long dis-
tance rates.

For example, the Washington
and Lee campus is now connect-
ed to the city of Roanoke through
a trunk line installed this sum-
mer. The cost to the University
for leasing this trunk line is
‘“‘very expensive,” said Parsons,
but he added that the normal
cost of long distance calls to that
area would greatly exceed the
leasing price.

University operator Agnes
Gilmore called the system ‘‘cer-
tainly more economical’ since
the W&L community makes
‘tremendous amounts of long
distance calls.”

Parsons anticipates that the
$450,000 system will pay for itself
over a three- or four-year period.

The phones on campus are one
of the three models: the 120, 240
or 400. The 400 model is the most
exclusive, and the University
purchased only five, two of
which are in the president’s of-
fice. Each professor and most
clerical and secretarial workers
use the 120 model, while many
administration officials use the
240 model.

Although the software quality
of the CBX system allows flexi-
ble growth for changing needs,
features now available include
automatic callback, call for-
warding to other extensions and
transferring and reconnecting
capabilities.

In addition, incoming calls
may be transferred automatical-
ly to the different phones in what
is known as a “‘hunt”’ group. For

i = erat

The Ring-tum Phi, September 20, 1984, Page 9

W&L’s new phones: convenient,
cost-efficient and confusing

example, if Laura deMaria of
the Summer Programs office is
unavailable to answer her
phone, the caller will auto-
matically be transferred after
four rings to the office of Robert
Fure, director of Summer Pro-
grams.

Another “‘marvelous”’ feature,
according to Parsons, is system
speed. In the computer’s memo-
ry have been stored 230 long
distance numbers. System speed
allows the user to connect with
those numbers by pushing only
four numbers instead of 12.

Among the numbers included
are those of board members,
local emergency groups, banks
and investment agencies, news
media, printers, suppliers and
libraries, as well as those of
other schools.

Station speed is a similar
feature, except the numbers are
more personal and are asso-
ciated with individual telephone
extensions.

Because each phone now can
be reached by dialing direct, of-
fice extensions are accessible
even when the central switch-
board is not manned.

Mrs. Gilmore noted that a pro-
blem in past years occurred dur-
ing summers, when the switch-
board closed at 5 p.m. and cut off
all outside calls, excluding calls
for administration officials
whose phones were already ac-
cessible through direct dialing.

Parsons said that in planning
the new system, consideration
was given to the ‘‘possibility and
probability that all professors
will want to have a personal
computer” within the next few
years.

Before next summer, the
University will acquire data
modules which will make it
possible to send computer data
transmissions over the existing
telephone lines. This equipment
will be connected to the CBX

system, which already is housed
in the basement of Graham-Lees
Dormitory.

Parsons, who was involved
eight years ago in the selection
of the Centel system, pointed out
that the breakup last January of
AT&T prompted the decision to
investigate new systems.

Since 1976, Washington and
Lee had paid a monthly tariff to
Centel for the use of the old
system. When AT&T was forced
to break up,local offices were
given more freedom. Centel sub-
sequently offered W&L_ the
chance to buy the system it had
been leasing for eight years,

The University instead hired
the Communications Consul-
tants Corp. of Virginia to
analyze its position.

The ROLM Corp. offered the
best technology and in the end
was ‘‘able to meet our specifica-
tions at the lowest cost,” Par-
sons said.

In July, ROLM surveys were
conducted to meet the needs of
individual offices. ‘‘We’ve tried
to give people the phones they
need at the minimum cost,” ex-
plained Parsons, who added that
acquisitions for higher standard
telephone models will be con-
sidered later.

Parsons recognized ‘‘some el-
ement of dissatisfaction (with
the new system) since some of-
fices operated around the old
system.’’ He said he also
realizes that ‘low-level _ in-
timidation” has been generated.

Since the faculty and office
numbers are not yet available to
the public, the University
switchboard still must handle
many incoming calls.

Switchboard operators have
noticed, however, a reduction in
the number of personal phone
calls, and one student worker,
John Janner, remarked that
“people are pleased to bypass
the switehboard.”’

Polo ties
Hopkins
in Classic

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

’’That one goal could make the
difference in our whole season,”’
said head water polo coach Page
Remillard, referring to Kevin
Lederer’s last-second game-
tying goal against Johns
Hopkins that allowed the Gen-
erals to finish among the top four
teams instead of the bottom
four. The Generals placed fourth
in a field of eight teams in the
W&L Fall Classic last weekend.
Johns Hopkins and W&L won
two games and lost two.

Navy won the tournament with
a perfect 5-0 record. The Univer-
sity of Arkansas/Little Rock
finished second.

If the Generals had lost to
Johns Hopkins, they would have
had to play Duke. Remillard did
not want his team to play Duke
this weekend. Because Duke is
in Generals’ conference, Remi-
llard prefers to play them after
his team has had time to im-
prove.

In their final game of the
weekend, the Generals defeated
Dayton 12-11 when Bobby Pear-
son scored on a penalty shot late
in the game.

Dayton had previously won its
game against Arkansas, who
crushed the Generals in the se-
cond game of the tournament. “I
thought that said a whole lot
about how much we improved
over the whole weekend,’’ said
Remillard.

Remillard added, ‘‘Our
freshmen were making mistakes
against Arkansas that they did
not make against Dayton.”

Coach Remillard also noted
that his team’s performance was
not a fluke because the entire
team played well. He stated that
if only one of his players had
played well then one might con-
sider the Dayton game a fluke.

W&L’s Eric Sullivan (6) winds up and fires a shot in the
Generals’ crucial 13-13 tie against Johns Hopkins. W&L. finished
fourth in the eight-team event, earning victories over VCU and

Dayton.

Despite the Generals’ victory
against Dayton, W&L finished
fourth because the total goal dif-
ferential for the tournament
went in Dayton’s favor.

Before losing to Arkansas in
their second game, the Generals
defeated Virginia Common-
wealth, 20-5.

Tim Stanford scored 12 goals
to lead the Generals last week-
end. Stanford, however, had
trouble with personal fouls, ac-
cording to Coach Remillard, and
fouled out of the Dayton game.
Remillard said, “It (foul trou-
ble) is nothing that he can’t get
under control and I am sure that
he will get it under control.”

Remillard also noted that
sophomore Kevin Lederer
“looks very sharp.”’

Prior to last weekend only two
of Remillard’s 21 players had
varsity experience. Remillard
took advantage of last weekend
to give experience to his players.

During practice this week, the
Generals will concentrate on

ball handling and goal keeping,
Remillard said.

“We are still waiting for an
average game from. our
goalies,” said Remillard. He ad-
ded, ‘‘If our goalies come around
like they are capable of, we are
going to be a typical W&L team
and a very strong contender for
the conference crown.”

The Generals will travel to An-
napolis, Md., this weekend to
play in the Southeast Varsity In-
vitational. The top four teams on
the East Coast are also playing
in the tournament. Brown (1),
Slippery Rock (2), Bucknell (3)
and Navy (4) are also ranked
among the top 20 teams in the
country in NCAA Division I.

Despite having many inex-
perienced players on his team,
Remillard believes his team has
a positive attitude about facing
the tough competition this
weekend. “The players want to
play these big teams and test
their individual skills,’ said
Remillard.

Remillard stated that if his
team improved as much as they
did last weekend then his
players will have made a lot of
progress.

Remillard concluded, ‘‘We
could go 0-4 this weekend and
come away having made pro-
gress.”’

Generals stung
by Wasps, 28-0

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Emory and Henry Wasps
used a four-touchdown blitz in
the second half to defeat
Washington and Lee 28-0 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference football opener for both
teams.

E&H (2-0) was its own worst
enemy in the first half, commit-
ting four turnovers. However,
W&L (1-1) was unable to
capitalize on the Wasps’
mistakes, and the two teams
entered the locker room tied 0-0
at halftime.

In the third quarter, E&H
third-team quarterback Sam
Blevins ignited his team’s of-
fense, leading it to two third-
quarter touchdowns and a 14-0
lead.

The Wasps added two in-
surance scores in the fourth
quarter, making the final score
28-0.

Blevins clearly was the key to
E&H’s second-half resurgence.

He completed 10 passes in 15 at-
tempts for 125 yards and one
touchdown and rushed for two
more scores.

W&L was unable to move the
ball consistently against the
stubborn E&H defense. The

Generals totalled only 115 yards
offense in the game.

Quarterback Bobby Wilson,
under heavy pressure from the
Wasp defensive line, completed

_ four of his 17 tosses for 59 yards.

On the day, W&L runners rushed
for 132 yards but had only 54
yards net rushing due to 78 yards
suffered in losses.

Fullback Frank Surface led
the Generals on offense with 41
yards rushing on 14 carries and
three receptions for 39 yards.

Free safety Chris Wilson head-
ed the General’s defense with
two interceptions to go with his
five tackles and seven assists.
Linebacker Kurt Specht added
three tackles and seven assists.

W&L head Coach Gary Fallon
said he was not pleased with his

Wins and losses in terms of dollars and cents

|, Proved again
' that the college
game has be-
come a bit too

teins A .J big bucksy for
its own epee Charley Pell and
the Gator scandal has reached a-
head with the former’s dismissal
and the latter’s Seing indicted by
the NCAA on 107 recruiting vio-
lations. George Vecsey of the
New York Times pointed out in
his space on Sunday that the
great problem in college may lie
not only with the college coaches
but also with that maniacal
species known as the ‘“‘booster.”’
Vecsey wisely calls these beings
“‘who believe their school should
be No. 1...as big a blight, in their
own way, as the people who push
drugs (on athletes).’”’ True’ and
what’s more, Mr. Vecsey, the

 

 

 

drug problem perhaps can be
combatted (as is presently being
done by 30 major college pro-
grams, where drug testing has
been implemented), but the pro-
blem with the booster is as old as
the game itself and all the indict-
ments, no matter how numerous
or flagrant the violations, will
not dissuade Richie Rich, sports
hungry alumnus from East Po-
dunk Tech, from shelling out a
few monetary favors to ensure
that the Techies have another-
winning season. No, the problem
does not lie with the booster — he
is an animal beyond control.
(Indeed, we could all be alumni
someday and heretofore the po-
tential to be boosters looms
large.) Rather, as Vecsey slam
dances on the issue, the problem
lies with “coaches who teach
young people that breaking the
rules is justifiable as long as the
good guys win.” The notion of
athletic competition has been
forgotten with the tendency to-
ward bigger and bigger price
tags in college sports. Season
tickets no longer go to those who
simply want to root for the home
team and pay the listed price.

Cross country team
is faster, confident

A eT
By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

This Saturday the Washington
and Lee cross country team will
open its 1984 season at Mary
Washington College where they
run against the Scots and Wash-
ington College.

Tosay the team is enthusiastic
would be an understatement.
“After Saturday we will be 2-0,”
commented team co-captain
Frank Pittman.

“We're not trying to sound
cocky,’’ said sophomore David
Andrews, “But this is a tighter
and faster team than we had last
year.”’ The time trials from last
Saturday prove Andrews to be
correct. About three minutes
separates junior Eddy Goundry,
the number one runner, and the
number 12 runner. This is ahead
of last year’s pace, Coach Dick

Miller said.

Behind Goundry is a veteran
group of upperclassmen includ-
ing senior captains Pittman and
Mark Pembroke.

The team had two major
losses from last year’s roster,
captain Angus McBryde, an All-
American, and Paul Chapman.

But the team did pick up Con-
rad Boyle, Kevin Kelley and
Gordon Ogden from the track
team as well as eight freshmen.
Of those freshmen, several are
in the team’s top 12. Because of
the new faces the team seems to
have more depth.

Coach Miller refused to make
any predictions for the season,
but Pittman said, ‘‘We will win
the conference and go to nation-
al, and that’s no goal or ambi-
tion, it’s a legitimate estima-
tion.”

Soccer throttled

ByWILLIAMHANNA

Special to the Phi

 

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team opened its 1984 season
with two losses at the Emory
University Invitational Tourna-
ment last weekend. The generals
were beaten by Emory 6-1 on
Friday and lost again to Georgia
State on Saturday by a score of
10-0.

Head coach Rolf Piranian said
he is not going to focus on any
one aspect of the Generals’ play

in preparation for Saturday’s
home opener against Averett.

Piranian said, ‘Obviously,
when you give up 16 goals, you
have to focus on defense, but,
then again, we only scored one
goal and we'll be working on that
as well.”

If last weekend’s games, Pira-
nian said, ‘We are disappointed,
but still optimistic. We will be a
different looking team Saturday
than we were last weekend.”

Game time for Saturday’s
matchis 2 p.m.

No, oftentimes in today’s big
money college game, you’ll get
your requested season ticket on-
ly by throwing in an excessive
and mandatory ‘‘donation” in
addition to the exorbitant ticket
prices. So what, you say. Hap-
pens all the time. Yes, and so it
does. My gripe is not with some-
one specific, not the players, the
coaches or even the boosters.
They are already diseased. My
complaint is with the whole col-
lege system. It’s reached a point

_ where wins and losses are view-

ed in terms of dollars and cents
rather than in terms of lessons
learned and _ characters
strengthened- I’m proud to say
that W&L had enough foresight
to get out of the rat race over 30
years ago. We can only wonder
why the rest of the college world
didn’t see the same light...

.... Returning to athletic decen-
cy and the Colonnade, I haven’t
much to say. The W&L harriers
begin their title quest this
weekend and this group looks
very strong. (Hint: very strong
means ‘‘will go a long way.’’)

Page Remillard sees reason for

team’s play against E&H.

“As pleased as I was about the
Dickinson win (36-7 last week), I
wag disappointed in the Emory
and Henry loss,” Fallon said.
“We put in a good effort, but we
just didn’t execute.”

“Tt cannot blame the loss on
any one phase of the game,
because we didn’t do many
things right,’”’ Fallon continued.

 

hope, and so do I. This team
showed a good bit of character,
and I’ll take character over
talent any day. Soccer reports
are dismal, but let us not give up
the ship at such an early date.
Football: Bad days and good
days come and go. Let us hope
the bad have come and gone and
that they can take advantage of
opponents’ turnovers. Would
also like to see some offensive
confidence...

....More Colonnade notes: A
tip of the cap to last year’s
baseball standout captain Dave
Warrenfeltz on earning Second
Team All-America honors...And
here’s another baseball related
matter from the Politics in the
ODAC? Dept.: Phenomenal
W&L pitcher Billy White is to be
congratulated on the release of
final NCAA Division III baseball
stats. White ended his brilliant
1984 campaign with the second
best ERA in the country. Now,
figure this one out: White was
not named to the AIll-ODAC
team....

....Now that North Carolina
has played and lost its first
game, it’s time for an early-

“Emory and Henry was, as ex-

pected, a tough, aggressive
team.”

The Generals return to action
against the Centre College Col-
onels Saturday in Danville, Ky.
W&L won the 1983 meeting be-
tween the two teams, 28-7.

Centre (1-1) lost its season
opener to E&H 19-14 before
bouncing back to defeat
Washington University

(Missouri) 17-16 last Saturday.
The Colonels feature a potent
offense led by quarterback Mike

season look at the Heisman. Bo
Jackson will not win because of
the team he plays for. Mr. Flutie
from Boston College is my front
runner right now. The man’s got

- poise’ a knack for getting the

most out of any situation and, of
course, the talent and stats to
put him in front of the rest. Out-
siders that are not to be over-
rlooked include Napoleon Mc-
Callum of Navy and Johnny
Jones of Tennessee (400 yards,
two games and what’s more the
Vols are 20)...

....Here’s one from the Hard to
Believe Dept.: A recent NCAA
study says the new rule requir-
ing freshmen to achieve a mini-
mum SAT score of 700 would dis-
qualify a large percentage of
black athletes who eventually
graduate. Not being discrim-
inatory, but if they can’t get 700
and they’re graduating, then I
have to wonder just what
courses they’re taking...

....And before we leave, here’s
a confidential to The W&L Law
News: Brown challenging Woof-
ter is akin to the Orioles deciding
that now would be a good time to
make a runat the pennant.....

Hall. Hall completed 19 of 36
passes for 233 yards and one
touchdown in Centre’s victory
over Washington.

“‘We have our work cut out for
us,” Fallon said. ‘‘They have an
explosive offense that can move
via the air or on the ground.”’

Tight end Ian Banwell and
linebacker Bob Berlin, both
starters, will miss the Centre
game due to injuries suffered
against E&H. Banwell separated
his right shoulder, and Berlin
has a badly sprained ankle.
