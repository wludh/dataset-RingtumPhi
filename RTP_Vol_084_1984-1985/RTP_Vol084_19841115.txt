While many Washington and Lee
students spent last weekend braving
the wildlife of Fall Weekend at Hol-
lins and Sweet Briar, 72 W&L ROTC
students were braving the wilds of
the George Washington National
Forest.

The reason for this foray into the
wilderness was the military science
department’s fall semester Field
Training Exercise (FTX). The FTX
began Friday afternoon and lasted
overnight until Saturday afternoon.

Of the 72 cadets participating in the
operation, 49 were on the defensive
with the ROTC battalion. The re-
maining 23 were members of the
W&L Ranger Company and acted as
the aggressor forces during the exer-
cise.

The W&L Ranger Company is a
voluntary extra-curricular activity
of the military science department
designed to provide ROTC students
with additional training and chal-
lenges to prepare them for their ex-
periences in the Army.

 

 

ows

The scenario for the FTX was this:

The battalion was to establish a de-
fensive perimeter around its camp-
site and protect it from any enemy
attack. The Ranger Company’s job
was to assault the position and take
the campsite.

The battalion was dug in securely
to its position by 7 p.m. and waited
for the Rangers to move in on the pos-
ition. Things were relatively quiet
until about 9:30, when the Rangers
made their assault.

The entire assault was over in a
matter of minutes, and when the
smoke had cleared the battalion re-
grouped from the attack of the Ran-
gers. It would be fair to say that both
sides could claim a victory for the
evening. The Rangers were success-
ful in overrunning the defensive posi-
tion of the battalion, but the battalion
was able to repel the force back into
the woods

The Ranger’s assault of the battal-
lion’s defensive position was the only
activity Friday night. But Saturday
morning started bright and early
with breakfast and for the breaking
down of camp.

The first part of the morning was
taken up with classes conducted by
the seniors. These classes covered a

Two Washington and Lee alumni
who were classmates have been
elected to six-year terms on the
Board of Trustees, the University an-
nounced this week.

Beverly M. ‘“‘Bo’’ DuBose III of
Atlanta and W. Hayne Hipp of Green-
ville, S.C., were elected at the
board’s October meeting. Their
terms begin Jan. 1.

Both DuBose and Hipp graduated
from Washington and Lee in 1962.

They fill the spots left by the
retirements from the board of T. Hal
Clarke of Atlanta, H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg and James A. Phil-
pott of Lexington, N.C.

Hipp, who received his bachelor of
arts degree in English from W&L,
said he was surprised by his election.
“T did not know I was being nomi-
nated,”’ he said. ‘‘I had no idea that I
was actively being considered as a

“It’s certainly one of the biggest
honors I’ve ever had. I was a little
overwhelmed by it,’’ added Hipp,
whose wife, Anna Kate, is a trustee of
her alma mater, Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

From his wife’s experiences there,
Hipp said, he recognizes the two ma-
jor functions of any board of trustees
— fund-raising and choosing a presi-
dent (Mary Baldwin’s president re-
signed last month).

At this point, though, he added,
W&L is facing neither problem.

Among issues facing the trustees
are the transition to coeducation and
the reaction to the change among stu-
dent, faculty and alumni and “how
the (new) student center will assimi-
late into the fraternity system,”’ said
Hipp, who is president of Liberty
Corp., a conglomerate whose hold-
ings include a life insurance firm.

variety of subjects, including in-
dividual tactical training, squad
movement techniques and the rules
governing the treatment of prisoners
of war.

After these classes, the students in
the battalion got an opportunity to
put their newly acquired skills to the
test. Each of the three squads con-
ducted a reconnaissance patrol of the
Ranger camp and reported back to
the cadet chain of command.

After the reconnaissance patrols,
the cadets packed up their gear and
returned to Lexington. After return-
ing their equipment to the supply
room, the cadets’ last task was clean-
ing their weapons.

The FTX was viewed a complete
success. Capt. Robert R. Ripple, bat-
talion operation officer, said it was
an exceptional exercise. ‘‘The first
night went real well,” he added.
“The Rangers did a good job charg-
ing down the hill.”’

Senior Greg Lukanuski, cadet com-
mander of the ROTC battalion, said
he was initially a little worried but
was pleased with the outcome.
“When the time came, everyone

W. HAYNE HIPP
.. new W&L trustee

Hipp, who earned his master’s
degree in business administration
from the Wharton Graduate School of
Business at the University of Penn-
sylvania, said he favors coeduca-
tion. :

A member of Phi Delta Theta at
W&L, Hipp said, ‘‘As a former stu-
dent or alumnus, you always hope
that someday you will have the
chance to give back to W&L what you
took from it.”

Hipp first joined Liberty Life In-
surance in 1969 and, in 1978, became
chief executive officer of the Liberty
Corp., which is the parent organiza-
tion of Liberty Life and Cosmos
Broadcasting and has operating units
in 41 states. He began his profession-
al career with Metropolitan Life In-
surance in San Francisco in 1965.

Hipp also serves as a director of
the South Carolina National Bank,
Dan River Inc. and South Carolina
Electric & Gas Co. He is vice chair-

leges, the Greenville YMCA and
Episcopal High School in Alexandria.
He also is a member of the South
Carolina State Department Board.

DuBose, who received his bachelor
of science degree in commerce from
W&L, said he would like to regard
himself as a ‘‘grassroots trustee.”’

“The most gratifying thing of this
to me is I think I have been chosen as
a result of having been active on the
local level,’ DuBose added. ‘It’s an
indication that the trustees are
aware of the role that the not-so-
visible alumni play.”

OPINION

 

Where’s the book?

Last week we made a disillusioning discovery. On the eve
of the election, someone had stolen the Election Preview and
other recent issues of Congressional Quarterly from the
University Library. Further research showed that a major
article about political polls had been torn out — ripped off, if
you will — of one of the newsmagazines.

This was more than annoying, but we figured it was an
anomyly that doesn’t happen but once in a student genera-
tion. Think again. The librarians don’t seem the least bit sur-
prised when notified that materials are missing. An inven-
tory was taken this summer, and in the last four years, 1,200
books have ‘‘walked out”’ of the library. That’s more than one
a day while school is in session.

There’s a great invention called a photocopy machine.
There are two of them in the library, and they prevent the
need to purloin periodicals. If the tfuth were known, we’d
rather have people stealing dimes than filching reference
materials. At least you can get more dimes.

There’s one consolation for all of us who’ve gone to the
library absolutely, positively needing something, and finding
it missing — God will get you if the EC doesn’t.

Killing ourselves

Last Tuesday, scattered among the election predictions in
the Metro section of The Washington Post, was the tragic
story of Douglas Ealey II, a high school senior in Prince
George’s County, Md., who committed suicide.

It was not a regular news story. There was something more
unnatural than suicide about this particular case. The victim
was a student leader, elected by his peers to represent them
as the only student on the county board of education. He had
fine grades, a happy home life (by his mother’s account; his
father died in the Vietnam War) and an active social life and
was looking forward to applying to prestigious colleges that
had carefully courted him during the summer. Everything
seemed to be coming up roses.

But something obviously wasn’t. For at 9 a.m. on Monday,
Nov. 5, Ealey pulled the trigger of a 20-gauge shotgun with
the barrel pointed at his chest.

But Ealey’s case was not the first teen-age suicide this
year. Nationally, there have been over 4,800 documented sui-
cides among the 13-18 age group this year; last year’s total
was 5,200 deaths. Government experts believe those numbers
discount the real rise in deaths because many suicides are
recorded as accidents, In the past 25 years alone, suicides in
the 13-25 age group have tripled.

Why are we students seeing our ranks thinned so slowly
and surely?

Some cite the cost factor. A college education today totals a
modest $40,000 at most private institutions, and at least half
that at most public schools. As reflected in the recent elec-
tions, students are optimistic about their futures, yet a dis-
mal grade in the interim seems to cloud that sunny view.
Some psychologists say a perceived increase in parental ex-
pectations by students has made many fearful of failure. And
inevitably, increased academic competition among students
has created an air of anxiety unparalleled on most campuses.
The ‘‘whatcha get?’’ syndrome has become more than a
friendly inquiry into your neighbor’s competence or lack
thereof. Letter grades, we are told, spell success.

Tragic seems to come short of aptly describing the situa-
tion, however. As students, we may be fiercely competitive,
but in being such we lose sight of the real value of our educa-
tion. For us, as it has been for all generations, the value of
education is not merely our standing relative to others, but
our standing relative to ourselves. We are challenging our-
selves, our minds, our endurance to learn more, faster and
better than ever before. We struggle more against ourselves
in the true sense of education than against our peers. But
somewhere along the line, we have lost sight of that valuable
insight into education. We have begun — and continue— to
think that our worth is not so much in and of ourselves as it is
in and of our grades, those letters we so hate that get us into
jobs or graduate programs.

Blame cannot be easily shifted anywhere for this dilemma.
Shortfalls abound. The easy target, the undefinable ‘‘socie-
ty,’ seems somehow inadequate in this case. But we must get
away from the idea of assigning blame and believing the pro-
blem will vanish. The resolution to the rapid increase is not
easily determined, but a start can be made. We, as students,
must begin to realize that our education is the training of our
minds, and not merely a tool which we use to gain short-lived
academic superiority in the classroom. We need to recognize
that life exists beyond college and that academic mistakes to-
day will most likely have a negligible influence on our
lifestyle ten years from now. A ‘‘C” today does not spell an
“‘F”’ for our future. We should begin to see that the most im-
portant lesson we can learn from our college days is not just
how well we did on a paper, but how well we fared against
ourselves. The race, they say, is not always to the swiftest
but to those who keep on running.

Big bucks buy more than votes.

MY VIEW

By John Winters

 

It’s been more than a week since
the election; the glitter, hoopla, sor-
row and grief are beginning to fade.
While janitors clean up the mess
from victory parties, ‘‘wait till next
time”’ parties and the plain old “‘let’s
party because it’s an election’”’ par-
ties, a time of reflection seems in
order.

What occurred in the presidential
election will politely be called a de-
feat. Being more realistic, somehow
the word “‘annihilation’’ seems more
appropriate. Let’s face it, losing 49
out of 50 states doesn’t exactly fall
within the ‘‘well, we gave it our best
shot’’ category.

Dismissal
‘buggeth’

SABU VP

Tothe Editors:

I have been at W&L four years now
and have not written The Phi until
now. But the issue of Dean John L.
White’s dismissal “‘buggeth me.”
Just some questions to whom it may
concern: If he indeed misapproprited
funds (a nice way to say embezzle-
ment) in past years, why hasn’t our
diligent Executive Committee charg-
ed the third-year law student with an
honor code violation; Why will Presi-
dent Wilson, after accusing him of
fiscal irresponsibility, wish him well
in a legal career (one bound to in-
volve. monetary endeavors), hand
him a degree personally next May
and pay him until June? Either the
man is guilty or not. Hypocrisy is not
supposed to be the foundation of a
gentlemanly collegiate atmosphere,
is it? Maybe it was the spring honor
trial. Nah, they let you exhibit emo-

. tion around here when a student’s fu-

ture is being altered. I’m a student
meddling in administrative affairs,
huh? Funny, I thought the faculty
was here for the student body. Re-
sentment is surfacing, better stop
this letter. Now I realize my objec-
tive credibility is destroyed by sign-
ing this letter, but I'll sign. Boy,
something ‘‘smelleth.”

Kim S. Brunson

Vice President,
Student Association for Black Unity

YD’s gain
praise for
work, help

Tothe Editors:

I would appreciate your letting me
use this means of thanking the Young
Democrats of Washington and Lee
for their help to the three local
Democratic committees in the recent
campaign. They gave time, money,
ideas and inspiration. A number of
students participated in various
ways. Two, in particular, (Everett
Hamilton and David Hanna) need to
be singled out as having participated
in every way possible — from helping
to clean and decorate our headquar-
ters, manning the Buena Vista phone
bank, attending and contributing to
our fund raiser events, spending long
hours ‘‘keeping the store open’ at
headquarters, to showing up to swell
the ranks of well-wishers whenever a
candidate came to town.

We greatly appreciated everyone’s
help and look forward, with pleasure,
to student interest and participation
in future political efforts.

We also appreciated the coverage
of our political news and events by
The Ring-tum Phi and T.V. station
WLUR. Both added a dash of excite-
ment and fun, which few other towns
our size canclaim. We thank you.

Polly Turner, chair
Lexington Democratic Committee

Yet what concerns me the most
was the incredible amount spent on
the presidential election. No one
knows exactly how much was spent
by the two parties in an attempt to
get their presidential candidates in
office. Those figures won't be out for
a while but, rest assured, part of your
tax dollars will cover them.

What we do know is that a 30-sec-
ond paid political campaign ad cost
$120,000. For those of you without
calculators handy, that comes out to
roughly $6,000 per second. That
struck meas rather interesting, and I
thought of how else that money could
be spent.

Just think, with one second, instead
of saying ‘‘vote for me,”’ you could
buy a nice domestic car, or one of
those new coffee pots the Air Force is
pushing for Christmas this year. Or

 

take about five seconds and you could
buy the top-of-the-line BMW and
start getting into those other imports
such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche
and, dare we say, Ferrari.

Or let’s say you’re interested in
your children’s future (looking
ahead, that is). Instead of taking two
aspirin when you start thinking about
tuition bills, take two seconds and
send them to Princeton for a year,
and have about $2,000 left over for
spending money.

Or, if you’re more interested in
playing, a mere second will get you a
catamaran, in fact, two cats with a
windsurfer thrown in. Or splurge: in
10 seconds you could buy a ski boat,
his/her fishing boats and a dock to
put them in.

One Mondale ad had Crosby, Stills
and Nash singing ‘‘Teach Your Chil-
dren,”’ for $6,000 a second that’s one

 

heck of an education. And who can

forget the Republican ad that spent

$120,000: trying to figure out if there
was a bear in the woods, and at the
end of the ad you still don’t know.

Sally Struthers asks for $18 a
month in her ‘Save the Children’’
crusade to feed and clothe a child.
Taking that into consideration, about
10 ads would feed and clothe all the
children of India.

Makes you stop and wonder just
what our tax money is being spent on,
and I didn’t even go into the expenses
for the personal staffs, car rentals,
hotel reservations, food, plane fares,
security, mailing costs and all the
other miscellaneous bills that occur
during elections.

I don’t even want to go into what
could have been done with those five-
and 10-minute spots just before the
election, but think about it.

The days of our lives?

 

MY
VIEW

By Al
Roberts

 

 

 

 

 

The mood was festive at an area
women’s college Saturday night dur-
ing the semi-formal dance that
headlines its annual fall weekend.

Some hopeful social activists had
bedecked the tables in the ballroom
with streamers, champagne glasses
and party hats.

A pseudo-swing band bounced from
classic shag rags to modern grooves
such as the Men Without Hats ‘‘Safe-
ty Dance.”’ (I had donned a party hat
and idly snapped the elastic band un-
til that number.) ‘New Year’s Eve in
November” was emblazoned on the
red grain cups, but this astute jour-
nalist was not to be fooled: I knew it
was not Dec. 31

Surrounded by current partners-in-
crime and some W&L alumni I had
endured some years with, however, I
could not ask for a better approxima-
tion of New Year’s Eve. But I
couldn’t escape the gnawing emp-
tiness that pervades many social
events among our little constellation
of single-sex colleges.

It was not New Year’s Eve, no mat-
ter how fervently we danced, as if to
ring out the old days and rage in the
new.

When we broke sweating from the
floor, beer (not champagne) was the
beverage of necessity, thanks to the
ABC. And just as we began to lose
ourselves in the moment, we were
reminded time and again of our

realities
ay

the Hill came stumbling by with ex-
travagant salutations and a simple
remark: ‘‘Where's your date?”’

‘‘Well, a handful of them invited a
handful of us,’’ we demurred.

Too many times we saw boredom
allayed only by liquor in couple’s
eyes. ‘Well, we showed up,’’ they
may have thought.

Too many times we saw careening
drunks spill beer on grandmothers’
gowns, too many songs went unsung.

Perhaps the restraint and excess
spring from a common cause — the
gnawing things — the little voice in-
side our heads that says: ‘‘Go for it
now. Don’t stop to talk. You won’t be
together tomorrow.”

This was the voice that pressed us
to the apartments when the band had
played its last. There, about 25 of us
— women and men, girls and boys —
performed the rites of New Year’s
Eve. Arm on arm, we sang the songs
we knew through high school. ‘‘Bye,
bye, Miss American Pie,”’ we croon-
ed, ‘‘the day the music died.’’ Some
of us hustled for mates, and some
just rapped the fat. Some of us got
drunk and puked, and some stayed
sober to make breakfast in the dawn.

But all of us slept in our separate
beds Sunday night (Well, most of us).
Most of us know that Sunday night
malaise. Most of us have felt like we
have failed from time to time, like we
should have struck up one talk more,
like we missed a chance.

This is the price we pay for our big
Tradition and our sense of place. We
are torn on Sunday nights, right
through the week, and in the shadows
and puddles of our noisy nights.

We are shredded by two desires.
We sometimes want our colleges to
be as one, as high school, where
lunches were shaTed and grades con-
tested. Many of us have never had
such luxury, stored away with our
separate sexes since puberty. At

rer hands we want

only to stifle this need, so we can
fulfill the expectation of past genera-

tions that ‘‘these are the days of our -

lives.”’

But should we let our youth be |

spent in another person’s idea of fun?

We are constantly bouncing, like so

many rising moons and suns, be-

tween blind revelry and courtly con- .

ventions. And tossed this way, isn’t it
always the middle ground that we
find most natural?

Some friends and I agree that _

years from now our fondest mem-

ories of this place will be those |

weekends truest to ourselves: that
day we packed some munchies and
motored to the Parkway, the night
we sat waiting for ghosts in the
Hollins graveyard .. . the concert in
Richmond.

One need only look to her elders
some vacation night to know that
cocktail parties don’t stop with the
earning of degreees. One need only
step into a local bar to know that he
will have many years to fall into
stupor.

There is life after the single-sex
college experience, and there will be
time for these things.

But never again will we have the
chance to see our peers changing
their minds in time with us. Never
again will we share the common bond
of maturation, of figuring this life
out.

We should not waste these four
fleeting years trying to be something
we are not, dressing like our elders or
thinking like our parents. If we start
with ourselves and arrive at our
roots, we can claim them for our
own. But to try to make it tomorrow,
New Year’s Eve, when it is not, is to
pass over youth like a difficult
chapter in a text.

‘‘Where was your date?”

“A handful of them danced with a

handful of us . . . we can dance if we
want ta.”
 

Students, profs discuss rules

The University Council’s Monday
meeting with students about the ap-
parent separation between students
and faculty was marked by typical
arguments, with students saying that
the new fraternity rules are too re-
strictive and faculty members con-
tending that the faculty is looking out
for the best interests of the student

body.

«<* nual Lee Day Party.

Held the Friday closest to Jan. 19,
| Robert E. Lee’s birthday, the Lee
‘' Day Party has grown from an atten-

“© , dance of about 30 its first year, 1978,

to nearly 300, making it one of the

‘largest annual off-campus events,
, DuBose said.

The trustees will attend the party,

‘s. at DuBose’s home, as part of their

«, ,next regular meeting, Jan. 18 and 19

in Atlanta. In fact, DuBose said, the

« ‘board rescheduled its meeting from

early February in order to be able to

. attend the party.

DuBose, who said he regarded his
,election ‘‘as a challenge and an op-
portunity,’ added that he ‘‘would like

 *to see the board in some respects be-

.come more communicative with the
alumni, and I would like to see what
*we’ve done here in Atlanta [with

' ,regard to recruiting and other alum-

ni activities] echoed on a nationwide
‘basis.”

The transition to coeducation, Du-
Bose said, ‘‘obviously, right now, is
‘probably foremost in my mind. From
_all indications, that is going to be the
most critical issue that we are going
‘to have to deal with in the next year.”
_ Following a poll of Atlanta-area
alumni by pollster Claibourne Dar-
‘den, a W&L alumnus, DuBose wrote
a letter to the board of trustees noting
‘that about 70 percent of those re-
sponding to the survey either strong-
ly or mildly opposed coeducation.

“We felt the alumni should be
given an opportunity to respond to
the challenge first’ by taking a more
‘active role in recruiting, DuBose
said, but ‘‘if other alternatives didn’t
work, coeducation might be a viable
solution that should be pursued.”

The suggestion of increased alumni
support caine to be known as “‘the At-

student leaders have pursued regula-
tion of the houses, too,’’ Parker said.
“Students must not overlook that
their self-interests as well as faculty
desires have prompted revisions.”

Attending Monday’s 3 p.m. session
at the Alumni House were University
Council members Parker, Instructor
Debora Rindge, senior Bill Joel and
junior Jeff Hubbard, as well as sever-
al other students. Earlier this month,
the UC proposed the idea of hav-
ing a specific committee study the
dwindling connections between stu-
dents and faculty. _

“The faculty is asking for input on
the subject of relations,” said history
Professor David Parker, an organi-
zer of the group. ‘‘There needs to be a
specification of problems between
students and faculty members, and
also there needs to be a clear identi-
fication of the source of the pro-
blems.”

Rindge pointed out the wide effect
of the fraternities on students, facul-
ty and the community. She said that
in any situation of tension, numerous
groups have conflicting responsibili-
ties to uphold, and a compromise

one freshman representative, Caru-
thers told the EC Monday night.

EC President Cole Dawson said
freshmen who want to talk to a repre-
sentative usually seek out an upper-
classman they have met through
fraternity Rush or freshman orienta-
tion, so an extfa member is not need-
ed.

“The question is ‘Do they think
they need another [representa-
tive]?’ ” Caruthers said

Freshman representative Brandt
Wood said he thinks one represen-
tative is adequate for the freshman
class, but agreed to ask his consitu-
tents if they want an additional re-
presentative for freshmen.

Each undergraduate class current-
ly has two representatives, but the
freshman class has only one, elected
in the fall. The first-year law class
has one representative, and one stu-
dent represents both the second- and
third-year classes.

Last week the EC voted to sponsor
a student body referendum about
whether to add another law represen-

some controversy. in the last few
weeks. :

At the Nov. 5 Executive Committee
meeting, Vice President James
White reported a complaint he’d re-
ceived about the Cold Check Commit-
tee’s operating methods.

“‘We were not accusing anyone of
not doing their job,” he said. ‘Our
job is to find out the facts.”

White said the complaint concern-
ed the fact that although University
Center secretary Carole Chappell
had placed notices in the commit-
tee’s mailbox from merchants about
cold checks, the memos were not
picked up.

Chappell said the volume has been
especially heavy in recent weeks
since bounced checks are most com-
mon at Thanksgiving break and at
the end of the school year.

Dina Albertoli of the Business Of-
fice staff said that until Friday, her
office had accumulated about $700 in

lanta Solution,” said DuBose, adding
that after the decision had been
made, he wrote University President
John D. Wilson to tell him that ‘the
would definitely have our support for
the University.”’

The relationship between the Univ-
ersity and fraternities also is impor-
tant, said DuBose, who did not join a
fraternity until midway through his
sophomore year and then was presi-
dent of Pi Kappa Alpha his senior
year.

While at the University, he also
was president of the Commerce Fra-
ternity, vice president of the senior
class and a member of Beta Gamma
Sigma, the honor fraternity for busi-
ness administration.

DuBose then worked as national
field sales manager for the Atlanta
Stove Works until 1977, when he and
W&L classmate Louis L. Jones III
formed the DuBose-Jones Co., an At-
lanta real estate developer.

must be reached so that each group
can pursue its goals.

Both Parker and Rindge maintain-
ed that the faculty is not seeking to
create conflict at all, but that it is
willing to mediate and to discuss any
problems. An impediment, however,
comes in the awareness of those stu-
dents who hastily question changes in
regulation and policy without under-
standing the issues. The Ring-tum
Phi is one accurate information
source, said Rindge, adding that if
people do not consult such sources
then they will rely on hearsay. She
recognized, too, the impossible task
of forcing people to read The Phi.

The other major topic of the ses-
sion concerned the lack of personal
communication between students
and faculty. One student recognized
the need for increased student initi-
ative to ameliorate problems and to
improve the situation. He mentioned
his success in working with faculty,
and said he thought only a small ef-
fort is necessary on the part of stu-
dents to improve communication.
Joel added that ‘‘the people who com-
plain most loudly about problems at

frosh rep

tative so each law class has one
representative. The referendum,
which will be on the ballot for March
EC officer elections, would raise the
number of EC members from 12 to
13.

Although the idea has not been put
on the ballot, the addition of another
freshman representative could raise
the number of members ot 14.

Also Monday night, the EC heard
from Henry Exall, chairman of the
cold check committee, who told the
committee that he is trying to per-
suade McDonald’s, Wendy’s and the
movie theaters to accept W&L stu-
dents’ checks.

The EC also heard budget reports
from the Hockey Club, the Calyx, the
Student Activities Board and The
Ring-tum Phi. The International
Club, the Frisbee Club and the Fenc-
ing Team were scheduled to report,
but did not show. The committee de-
cided to give the International Club a
second chance, but voted to freeze
the Business Office accounts of the
other two absent clubs.

returned checks. She said no action .

from the Cold Check Committee was
forthcoming until she threatened to
see Dean of Students Lewis John
about the matter.

She said the checks were then hast-
ily retrieved by Henry Exall, the
committee chairman. “It was the
first time I’d seen him this year,”
Albertoli said.

Exall said he was unfamiliar with
past committee procedure and was
unaware that the chairman of the
Cold Check Committee is responsible
for Business Office pick-ups.

He added that the merchants who
lodged the complaints are ‘‘notorious
for that sort of thing’’ and that he had
“‘checked into the situation.”’

“It’s a new committee and anytime
you have a new one, it takes time to
get oriented,’’ Chappell said.

Exall said that in the future, he
plans to pick up the Business Office
checks weekly.

 

Also last month, James M. Ballen-
gee was re-elected to his second six-
year term on the board and to his sec-
ond three-year term as rector. Bal-
lengee, a 1948 law school graduate of
W&L, is president and chairman of
Enterra Corp. a Radnor, Pa., holding
company with 10 subsidiaries.

Also re-elected to their second six-
year board terms were Thomas B.
Branch III, an Atlanta attorney who
graduated from Washington and Lee
in 1958, and Jerry G. South, a 1954
W&L graduate and president of BA
Mortgage and International Realty
Corp.

The third position left open by the
retiring board members will be filled
by a candidate nominated by the
alumni next year. Alumni vote on
candidates nominated by the Alumni
Board and the winner usually is
elected by the Board as a trustee, ac-
cording to University Secretary
James Whitehead.

W&L probably don’t know their fac-
ulty well.”’

Parker agreed and indicated that
as a faculty member, he’s discourag-
ed when students don’t use opportuni-
ties to voice problems. He recognized
the need to publicize conflicts in or-
der to achieve real improvements.
On the subject of fraternity regula-
tion, Parker suggested more overt
response to undesirable rules, say-
ing, ‘The fraternities should ask the
administration for clear factual evi-
dence that Wednesday parties hurt
things like GPAs and class atten-
dance.”

Another idea was for more infor-
mal contact between students and
faculty, and Parker suggested a stu-
dent-faculty discount at Cockpit hap-
py hours. He also commented that
publicizing the issue of student-fac-
ulty relations is important.

“This week’s meetings are a good
way to bring problems into the
open,” Parker said. ‘Some of the
deterioration in student relations is
hard to pinpoint, but mentioning
areas of difficulty can have a ther-
apeutic effect.”’

Russian films
help students
learn language

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Russian language film series,
“Kino-USSR,”’ presents its conclud-
ing film of the semester Thursday,
Nov. 29. The selection, titled ‘The
Twelve Chairs,”’ is a political satire
dealing with three con men in the
Soviet Union.

Russian Instructor Greta Mc-
Caughrin, the sponsor of the series,
said this week that Russian-oriented
films will probably continue next
term, but will be fewer in number
and presented in conjunction with the
politics department.

The purpose of this film series, she
said, was primarily to expose stu-
dents of Russian to the characteristic
rhythm and accent of the spoken lan-
guage. She pointed out that the mov-
ies also expose students to a foreign
culture, and give them the opportu-
nity to take advantage of experiences
beyond the normal classroom fare.

McCaughrin said her students, who
make up the bulk of the film audi-
ence, are often bored by the crude
Soviet film techniques and the idea-
listic views of the Soviet system, but
are pleased when they can pick up a
phrase or part of a conversation.

Independent Union sets
Dec. 1 Christmas party

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity members won’t be the
only students full of holiday cheer
(among other things) on Dec. 1 when
the Greeks traditionally throw their
Christmas parties. This year, Wash-
ington and Lee’s Independent Union
plans to have a bash of its own in the
Cockpit that night.

Though still in the development
stages, the IU is presently contacting
three area bands — the Convertibles,
the Nabobs and the Eliminators — in
the hopes of hiring one of them for the
party, vice president Luke Cornelius
said. In addition, he said, they are
trying to contact one of the local wo-
men’s colleges for support and parti-
cipation.

Cornelius said that the event will
provide alternative entertainment
for independents who are blocked
from fraternity parties. '

IU president Chuck Diffenderffer
said the band decision rests primari-
ly on how much money the IU will be
allowed to spend. The night prior to

Christmas Weekend

&

$6 at Door
$5 in Advance at W&L Bookstore

the party, the SAB will host the White
Animals and the Producers in the
new pavilion.

The Christmas party will be open
to all independents, Cornelius said.

“You don’t even have to be a dues
paying member,”’ he stressed: ‘‘Our
programs are not mutually depen-
dent. In other words, you don’t have
to put in a certain amount of work or
money to participate. We're here to
see what the independents want to
do.”

The IU has been participating in
Intramurals all year, and Cornelius
said they would plan to sponsor as
many teams as will participate. Fur
thermore, independents can organize
their own teams and the Union will
sponsor those as well.

In other areas, the IU has begun

putting together its own “‘cold test’’
file with contributions both from stu

_dents and professors. The file is open

to all independents and use is free to
contributors. The fee for using the
file will be minimal said Cornelius.

Members recently voted to ap-
prove dues of $15 per year.

Suicide

Continued from Page }
should not be ignored, Worth said.

“If you notice in a persistent way a person
using suicide references, I think if it were my
friend, I'd say, ‘At first I laughed, but now
it’s getting a little scary. Have you been
depressed lately?’ ”’

Worth said one circumstance that encour-
ages people with suicidal tendencies to act on
those impulses is for them to hear about or
read of another suicide. As an example, he
said that for six months after Monroe’s sui-
cide, there was a statistically significant in-
crease in the New York City suicide rate.

Another catalyst for suicidal behavior,
Worth said, becomes apparent when the indi-
vidual is under the influence of alcohol. ‘‘It’s
often hard enough to keep your Wefenses up
against the depression even when you're
sober,’’ he commented.

 

Dr. Lucy Davidson, a spokeswoman for the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said
the suicide rate for college-age people has
tripled in the last 25 years. Suicide is the third
most frequent cause of death for that age
group after accidents and homicide, accord-
ing to government statistics.

Davidson added that suicide is ‘almost
exclusively a phenomenon of white male-
ness.’ She said 88 percent of reported
suicides are in that category.

Davidson said a firearm is used in 63 per-
cent of male suicides. ‘“That may be a side ef-
fect of the male love affair with firearms,”
she said, adding that other common suicide
methods are hanging, asphyxiation, drug
overdose and cutting with a sharp object.

She said four males complete a suicide at-
tempt for every one female who completes it.
On the other hand, four females attempt it for
every oné woman who is successful. ‘‘The
figures just reverse,’’ she said.

A frequent explanation among researchers

 

 

for that disparity, Davidson said, is that
“‘with women it is more of a cry for help, but
with males it is a more intentional self-
destruction.”’

Worth said an important distinction exists
between a suicide gesture, which is a more of
a half-hearted, attention-getting effort, and
“a person who is really going for a kill.”

“Pills are convenient,”’ he said. ‘‘We are a
drug-oriented society. It’s not messy, and
there’s always the possibility that you will be
found or discovered or that there will be an
antidote.

“With a shotgun, school’s out. That’s it.
That’s an assassination of the self, not a cry
for help.”’

“There is a statistical probability that with
Washington and Lee coeducating, we will
have more suicide gestures,’ Worth said.
“That’s not sexist — that’s just statistics.”

Worth, however, sees a positive aspect to
the admission of women. ‘‘One of the reasons
I think coeducating is a good thing is that the

 

all-male atmosphere is stressful,” he said.
“It’s not easy for many students to establish
relationships with women— whether roman-
tic or just friendships.”

“With women coming on campus, my hope
and my conviction is that we’ll have an en-
vironment where W&L men can have more
meaningful relationships with women,” he
added. “The whole roadtrip situation and
a party mixer scene is very stress-

Dean of Students Lewis G. John said there’s
an unstructured system in which professors
and others who notice that a student seems
unusually depressed notify the proper school
officials.

“Definitely there is an informal system that
works,” John said. ‘My experience over the
last couple of weeks confirms that.’’

He said that in recent days at least two pro-
fessors have told him about students who had
— a marked change in mental atti-
tude.

Psychologist’s advice for crisis situations |

“The professors feel free — if not obligated)
to let us know if they sense problems,” he
said

He said Worth handles problems on a confi-’
dential basis, and added that except in ex
treme cases other parties are not brought in
without the student’s permission

“If Dr. Worth feels the individual is a threat ,
to himself or the community, he may feel
some step is necessary to see that the indivi- '
dual is hospitalized or that the parents are
notified,”’ he said. ‘‘Otherwise the confiden
tiality would not be breached.”’

John said other professionals on campus «
may also be able to help students with mental
health problems. ‘We've got a lot of people’
around here who are willing and able to. coun- ‘
sel students,”’ he said.

John said it’s impossible to know how ma
ny W&L students seriously consider suicide. *
“Not a lot,”’ he said. “But some do. It's the
ones that do that you have to worry about.”’

DR. JAMES W. WORTH

University counseling psychologist
Dr. James W. Worth offers advice on
how a person should react when a
friend is contemplating or threaten-
ing suicide:

1) Don’t panic. Be levelheaded.
Make sure you understand what your
friend is saying.

2) Express your concern and sup-
port for the person — they are going
through a tough time. Express your
strong conviction that suicide is not

an answer to the problem

3) Encourage your friend to talk
about what is bothering them. You
don’t have to be a psychologist or a
psychiatrist. You don’t have to know
the answers. You just need to listen.

4) Try to get a sense of how far
along in the contemplation process
your friend is. Have they written a
note in their mind — do they know
what they’d say in the note? Have
they fantasized a lot about how peo-
ple will react when they discover the

suicide — what the reaction of their
girlfriend, mother or dad, or friends
would be? If you find that the con-
templation process has gone a long
way, that’s a negative sign. Another
negative sign is the absence of future
thinking — not making plans or
thinking beyond a certain point.

5) If you feel the person is overtly
suicidal and about to do something,
stay with them. Try to get help, even
if it means calling the rescue squad
or the police. You can call a dean, or

(University Proctor Charles] Mur-
ray.

6) If the person does not appear
ready to do something but might.in
the future, see if they will come in to
see me. If they won’t, you come.in
and see me, and we'll talk about
ways we could encourage the person
to come in. A person who is suicida!
eventually does need to get into cou-
seling. They need to get their life.in
order so they don’t feel suicide is the
only option.

Lexington man charged
for automobile break-ins

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

A Lexington man has been ar-
rested in connection with several re-
cent break-ins of cars in the parking
lot near Red Square known as ‘“‘the
Corral.”

Mark Edward Hostetter has been
charged with 12 counts ranging from
tampering with a vehicle to grand
larceny.

According to Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton, Hostetter was first
arrested Nov. 2 and charged with
three counts of grand larceny, two
counts of petit larceny and four
counts of tampering with a vehicle.
He was later released and rearrested
Nov. 10, and charged with another
count of grand larceny, one count of
breaking and entering and one count
of unlawful entry -

Since the school year started, there
have been between 18 and 20 inci-
dents of cars being broken into, said
Sutton, adding that some of the cars
had their windows broken and, in
other instances, a coat hanger or
other such device was used to unlock
the doors.

Items taken included purses, cloth-
ing and other items of value left
in the vehicles. Sutton added that
almost all of the incidents occurred
on “party nights.”

Hostetter is being held in Rock-
bridge County Jail.

Sutton said the best way to prevent
automobile break-ins is not to leave
valuables in view. He added that
“leaving purses out or even putting
them under your seat invites trou-
ble.’’ He suggested locking valuables
in the trunk to prevent theft.

Many of the cars broken into be-
long to girls who come up for the par-
ties, which often leads to problems,
according to Sutton. Frequently, he
said, the girls either leave and wait
until the next day to telephone or
drive to the police station. Sutton em-
phasized that if a car is broken into,
the owner shouldn’t touch anything,
but should call the police immediate-
ly. This makes it easier for the police
to investigate the crime, he added.

In addition to helping the investiga-
tion, reporting the crime quickly can
make the police aware of the pro-

Leary talks on A

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Staff Reporter

 

We are on the verge of the next
stage in man’s evolutionary process,
and the home computer is the key to
unlocking the door, according to Dr.
Timothy Leary, who brought his
message to campus Thursday night.

“The.future of your life is going to
depend on how well you know your
brain,” Leary told an audience that
packed Lee Chapel. ‘‘The brain in
1984 is still a taboo organ,’’ he said,
but he predicted that within 10 years
man will reprogram his brain to
achieve the next logical evolutionary
step.

Liberally sprinkling ‘‘computer-
ese’ throughout his speech, Leary
gave a capsule history of ‘‘the evolu-
tion of intelligence in species and in-
dividuals.’’ He described how “‘know-
ledge information processors’ had
evolved from the garden of Eden,
through the medieval monastery, to
the Newtonian, industrialized con-
sumer society of today.

Equating the 1976 invention of the
Apple home computer with Guten-
berg’s 1456 personal book, the ‘‘first
mass produced object,’’ Leary said
the home computer will have an
equally profound impact. Our socie-
ty, he added, will move from an in-
dustrialized one to an informational
one.

Leary makes a point during his speech Thursday night.

Wearing a conservative gray suit
and white sneakers, Leary praised
Dr. Benjamin Spock’s post-World
War II creed, “treat your kids as in-
dividuals,” as planting the seeds for
this trend toward self-knowledge. In-
teraction between individuals was an
important byproduct of Spock’s
teaching, according to Leary, and
one that led to the searching, aues-
tioning mind he deemed necessary
for our evolution.

Leary concluded his 50-minute
speech with a comic rendering of a
Darwinian ‘‘macho theory of repro-
duction,”’ and he received a round of
laughter and applause. After a short
break, he answered questions about
subjects ranging from Jesus’ place in
our society to his notorious experi-
ments with drugs.

“Think for yourself, and keep your
eyes open,’’ were the themes to
which he kept returning. A self-pro-
claimed humanist, proud to have de-
scended from Adam and Eve, who
questioned God’s authority and broke
the first ‘‘two food and drug regula-
tions,’’ Leary admitted sympathy for
fundamentalists angered by his
ideas.

Admittedly having tried ‘more

drugs than anyone around,” Leary
said he understood why they weren’t
for everyone. He claimed that in the
1960s, drugs became just another
consumer item and that for every.
person unwilling to try them, there
are other ‘‘intelligent explorers.’’ He’
called drugs just another tool to “‘re.,
lease your brains,’’ which he equated
with “a hundred billion micropro-
cessors.”’ :
Leary also said he hoped that to-

day’s “incredible renaissance of the
body’’ would also lead to a renais-:
sance of the brain. Computers art
simply extensions of the brain and he
hopes future approaches to their use
will be along psychological and philo

sophical lines, rather than the cur

rent technical and industrial lines.

Where can Washington and Lee
students get ‘‘the write stuff’’? The
place is the Writing Center, a pro-

‘ ment to help students improve their

essay development.

Two senior English majors, Andy
Haring and Landon Jones, are avail-
able to tutor students.

Professor George Ray, the director
of the Writing Center, explained that

* there is a need for the program on
. campus,

“The backgrounds of the students

* in the last decade have declined,” he

said. ‘‘We need every mechanism to
correct the writing deficiencies that
weren’t addressed in prep school.”’
The Writing Center began three
years ago. More freshmen than up-

,

of students helped each year has in-

%
} perclassmen use it, and the number

creased, Ray reports.

He said that an average of four stu-
« dents a night have used the center
this semester. He described it as a

" “low-budget, no-frills operation’
. with an excellent staff.
“We have two very good tutors who

* are easy to talk to and to work with,”
, he said. ‘‘We tried to choose two sen-
ior English majors who are good
* writers and who are able to relate
. well with other students without
sounding patronizing or arrogant.”
* Jones explained why he thinks that
, the Writing Center is beneficial to
students.
“It gives students a chance to come
, to us with questions about revision,”
he said. ‘‘We can help them correct
* mechanical elements.”

Ray stressed that the Writing Cen-
ter is a peer tutorial service. He ex-
’ plained his role as being that of an
, administrator and a liaison to faculty

-

members who have referred students
to the program. Ray said the Writing
Center is open to all students who
want to improve their writing, re-
gardless of whether a faculty mem-
ber has recommended the program
to them. ‘‘Upperclassmen can
benefit just as much as freshmen,”
Ray declared.

Any Haring said students are only
allowed to bring ‘‘cold’’ — already
graded — papers to the sessions, ex-
cept when their professor gives them
permission.

The one-to-one atmosphere is one
of the positive components of the
Writing Center, according to Haring.
He sees himself as an equal with the
students who come in for help.

“I don’t think of myself as super-
ior,” he said. ‘‘I think of myself as so-
meone who has been there.”’

Sophomore Robert Berlin describ-
ed the program as beneficial to his
writing.

“Tt gives me the chance to get my
papers squared away,” he said. CK
impresses the teachers when your
papers are grammatically correct.”

Jones explained that conference
notes are kept during the session for
the director to determine the number
of people who use the service and to
chart the progress of the referrals.

Students who plan to go to the Writ-
ing Center should sign up in advance
so that the tutors can know how many
students to expect. Jones said that
this would be helpful to know how
many students are planning to attend
because both tutors are not always
present.

Haring had another suggestion for
students planning to come to the
Writing Center.

“They should read over their pa-
pers, read their professor’s com-
ments, and then come in and tell us
what they think the problem is,” he

» A Hollins College dean who was a
, Student at Bowdoin College when it
first went coed told members of the
* Coeduction Steering Committee they
, Should not expect the 18-year-old
women who come to Washington and
> Lee next year to be fully aware of the
, problems they will encounter.
Wendy Fairey, who also attended
‘ Barnard College when it was consi-
. dering closer academic ties with
then-all-male Columbia University,
‘also warned the committee that al-
, though it is planning in good faith, it
will inevitably be criticized for some
“ of its recommendations.
» Dean Pamela Simpson, chair of the
committee, said that committee
"members were not especially sur-
»prised by what Fairey said. She ar-
ticulated some impressions that com-
“mittee members already had, Simp-
«son said.
, Simpson said she has heard many
people say that the type of women
»who will apply to W&L will know
what kind of problems to expect. But
* Simpson said that the women in the
» first coed class will be preoccupied
with personal problems just like any
” other 18-year-old.
Simpson added that many people
_ think that there is no longer any pro-
blem of discrimination toward wo-
» men and that women at W&L will not
, encounter any problems with dis-
crimination.
» “When we talk to any special inter-
, est group, the initial response is that
there is no problem,”’ she said. ‘‘But
* when we invite them to think about it
_ they see there is a problem.”’

What Will It Mean?

Simpson noted that although the
committee has made few recom-
mendations so far, just discussing
some issues might be the most im-
portant aspect of the committee’s
work.

“We're inviting the committee to
consider things,’ she elaborated.
“Sometimes just raising the question
is going to be the important thing,”
said Simpson.

Simpson said that in other action,
Dean of Students Lewis John told the
committee that the University hopes
to fill the new assistant dean of stu-
dents position by July 1. Simpson
said that the function of the new dean
will include counseling and develop-
ing the women’s programs and help-
ing with career counseling.

said. “This saves us both time.”’

According to Ray, only 10 profes-
sors outside the English Department
referred students to the Writing
Center last year. He said informing
students of it is one of the major goals
for the program.

“One of our concerns is getting stu-
dents from other disciplines and for
students to come in without any im-
petus of their professors,’ he said.

Students may return to the pro-
gram as often as they like.

“We're not a cure-all,” Haring
said. “If you keep coming back,
you’ll see an improvement in your
writing.”

The tutors said that by reading
other people’s writing they gained in-
sights into their own, which helps
them to improve their compositions.

Tutoring is available in Payne 2B
from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursdays during the fall term.

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

With “Crimes of Passion,”
writer/producer Barry Sandler
and director Ken Russell have
given us one of the strangest and
most controversial movies of the
year. Like Brian dePalma’s ‘‘Bo-
dy Double,”’ “Crimes of Passion’
is full of explicit scenes of sex and
some violence, yet “Crimes”
deals more with people and rela-
tionships than the dePalma my-
stery did. ‘‘Crimes’ attracted
quite a bit of attention this year
because of its many trips to the
editing booth (to reduce its X-
rating to an R). What we are left
with is still a steamy, off-beat
story that may leave a bad taste in
one’s mouth.

Kathleen Turner plays a fashion
designer with a double life: in her
other identity she is the streets’
hottest hooker; Anthony Perkins

 

 

portrays a gutter ‘‘reverend’’ who
sets out to ‘‘save’’ her from her
prostitution; and John Loughlin is
an innocent family man whose
marriage is breaking down, who
falls in love with Turner after
discovering her double identity.
All three turn in strong perfor-
mances. Perkins’ insanity and at-
tempts to suppress his sexual de-
sires serve as foils for Laughlin’s
innocence and longing to fulfill his
desires, and Turner is caught in
the middle.

Many little things impressed me
in this film. The soundtrack
comes complete with leitmotifs,
including a bizarre rock video that
describes the fallout of Laughlin’s
marriage. The director also added
visual symbols, from the paint-
ings in Turner’s apartment to the
“Lifesavers” wrapping paper on
a gift given to Laughlin (from his
wife) ina vain attempt to work out
tne marital problems Unques-

The Ring-tum Phi, November 15, 1984, Page 5
Steamy ‘Crimes’ leaves bad taste

tionably, the relationship develop-
ing between the young man and
the woman-caught-between-two
worlds was, for me, the strength
of this film.

What bothered me most about
“crimes of Passion’’ was the cons-
tant interruption of the Tur-
ner/Laughlin scenes by Perkins.
The director’s point is clearly
stated, but he doesn’t have to
pound that point at us. Also, there
were moments when I felt Perkins
was pushing too hard. He has a
chilling style, and he makes great
use of it in several scenes; how-
ever, sometimes he just carries
things a little far.

I would like to recommend this
film without reservations. Unfor-
tunately the constant interrup-
tions by Perkins and his occasion-
al pushing won't allow me to do
this. ‘‘Crimes of Passion’’ is not a
a film, but it could be a better
ilm.

 

 

Computer package allows precise presidential prediction

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Before last Tuesday’s presidential
election, students in Professor
William Buchanan’s Politics 229
class predicted what the results
among Republican voters across the
nation would be.

These predictions were not random
guesses, however, In the month pre-
ceding the election, the class studied
factors that had affected results in
past elections. From this informa-
tion, each member of the class select-
ed those factors he thought would
have the greatest impact on
Republican voters.

The most commonly chosen fac-

knew what was up and did what they
were supposed to,” he explained.

Lukanuski said he was pleased
with the performance of the under-
classmen and especially with the
way the seniors conducted their
courses Saturday morning and their
overall performance. ‘‘The success
of the exercise can be directly at-
tributed to their performance,”’ he
added.

Another factor that contributed to
the success of the weekend was the
weather. Ripple said it was the best
weather for an FTX in the three
years he has been at W&L, and that
includes exercises held in the spring.

Ripple also pointed out that this
was the first FTX since the arrival of
the new military science chairman,
Col. Luke B. Ferguson. Ripple said
that Ferguson was surprised by the
professionalism displayed by the
juniors and seniors.

Ripple said an FTX is conducted to
serve several purposes: to give sen-
iors an opportunity to plan and carry
out a field exercise, to provide
juniors a chance to serve in a leader-
ship position, to provide cadets with
an opportunity to learn and hone mil-
itary skills. To give everyone a
chance to go out and have fun.

 

tors, Buchanan said, were the econo-
my, unemployment, previous voting
trends in each state and the personal
popularity of the president.

These factors, or variables, were
entered into a computer using a pro-
gram called Minitab, and the stu-
dents made a state-by-state analysis
and prediction of the election results.

It was a complex operation, Buch-
anan said. Students had to think on a
national scale as well as considering
each state’s particular interests
before making their predictions.
Data was collected on each of the 50
states and the District of Columbia.

Buchanan said he felt that the class
as a whole was successful with the
assignment. ‘‘The average error was
not too bad,’’ he said, adding that the

amount of error ranged from four to
eight percentage points per state.

Pat Hayden, a junior politics ma-
jor, had a 4.3 percent error, one of the
lowest in the class, in his prediction.
He said he thought his results were so
close to the standard deviation on the
assignment because he selected
specific variables rather than gene-
ral points in his analysis.

The variables Hayden used were
the economy, past political indentifi-
cation in each state and Reagan’s
personal popularity.

Although many of the students
used these variables. Hayden said a
better prediction can be made by ad-
justing the variables to get a more
accurate interpretation of the voters’
feelings.

In his case, Hayden narrowed his
economic category to the change ex-
perienced in personal income, some-
thing Reagan and the Republicans
stressed heavily in the fall campaign
with the question “Are you better off
now than you were four years ago?”’

Another variable that Hayden ad-
justed for was Reagan’s personal
popularity, a factor that apparently
was very important to voters across
the country.

Personal popularity seemed to
take precedence over the concrete
issues, he said, adding that the pro-
ject was interesting because it
“showed which variables were
important in this particular elec-
tion.”

SBC student pleads guilty in fatal wreck

A Sweet Briar sophomore plead-
ed guilty yesterday to a reckless
driving charge resulting from a
Sept. 22 crash that killed another
student.

Tracey A. McCoy was fined $50

mattox General District Court
judge.

McCoy is said to have fallen
asleep at the wheel of her BMW
when she was returning from
Hampden-Sydney College with
two other students inthe car.

Anne K. Adams was killed af ter
she was thrown from the car,
which ran off the road and repeat-
edly struck the guardrail at the
side of the road. The other passen-
ger sustained minor injuries.

Police investigators estimate
the car was going 65 to 70 miles an
hour when it crashed.

McCoy, who was hospitalized in
serious condition after the acci-
dent, did not testify yesterday.

Rout g

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee football
team clinched its fifth consecutive
winning season with a convincing
35-10 victory over Lebanon Valley
College Saturday in Annville, Pa.

The Generals dominated every
phase of the game, rolling more than
300 yards of offense and limiting
Lebanon Valley to 140 yards on the
way to their fourth consecutive win.

Senior tailback Gene Girard led the
General offense with 140 yards on 27
carries. Girard also had three pass
receptions for 55 yards. He scored a
touchdown to aid the W&L effort, as
well.

“It was great to see Gene Girard
have his best day of the year in his
last game of his career,’ head coach
Gary Fallon said.

W&L scored its first points in the
first quarter when Chris Bleggi ran
34 yards for a touchdown. James
White kicked the extra point, giving
the Generals a 7-0 lead with 3:43 re-
maining in the first quarter.

On Lebanon Valley’s next posses-
sion, W&L defensive back Tim Jany-
ska intercepted a pass by Kevin
Peters and returned it 36 yards for a
touchdown, making the score 14-0.

Neither team was able to score
again before halftime.

In the third quarter, W&L quarter-
back Jon Thornton put the Generals
ahead 21-0 when he passed 37 yards to
wide receiver Hugh Finkelstein for a
touchdown.

Lebanon Valley finally got on the
scoreboard later in e quarter when
placekicker Bob Muir connected on a
43-yard field goal, making the score
21-3.

The Generals turned the game into
a rout in the fourth quarter by scor-
ing two touchdowns.

Girard scored on a one-yard run to
up the Generals’ lead to 28-3. Senior
fullback Danny Jayne ran seven
yards for W&L’s final score, giving
the Generals a 35-3 lead.

Lebanon Valley scored late in the
game, leaving the final score 35-10.

W&L totaled 352 yards offense,
with 224 yards coming on the ground.
Thornton completed eight of 18 pass-

ives gridders record

es for 128 yards and one touchdown.

The General defense turned in one
of its better performances of the
season, giving up only 34 yards
rushing.

The five consecutive winning sea-
sons marked the first time the Gene-
rals have been able to accomplish the
feat since they did the same in the
1919-24 seasons.

“IT am proud of everyone on the
team, in particular the seniors, who
went out on a high note, winning four

inarow,”’ Fallonsaid,

“Offensively we were a little up-
tight, but our defense played ver:
well and shut down Lebanon Valley's
rushing game,” Fallon said. ‘‘The
defense scored once for us and con-
stantly give us good field position.”

The Generals won their first game
this season before dropping four of
their next five contests. W&L re-

grouped af ter its loss to Hampden-
Sydney to win its last four games
against the University of the South,

Bridgewater, Samford and Lebanon
Valley.

“T hate to see the season end,”
Fallon said. ‘‘We were on a roll, win-
ning our last four games, and proba-
bly would have continued to win. I
give the credit to the players, espec-
ially the seniors, who kept on
fighting.”’

The Generals lose 13 seniors from
the 1984 team, 12 of whom were start-
ers,

ment. The Generals will face Alfred University in Fri-
day night’s opener.

Cagers should be in thick of it again

 

y
Special to the Phi

The 1984-85 Washington and Lee
basketball Generals, by all indica-
tions, should bring a great deal of
excitement to the Warner Center this
winter. The Generals should once
again be in the thick of the race for
the ODAC title, along with perenially
strong teams from Roanoke and
Lynchburg.

“T am looking forward to this sea-
son with a great deal of anticipation
because we have excellent potential,
and could have a very good year,”
said W&L Coach Verne Canfield.

This statement alone should give
W&L fans cause for optimism, be-
cause Canfield is not known for mak-
ing such effusive statements before
the beginning of a season. Canfield,
who is entering his 20th year as the
Generals’ coach, has had 17 winning
seasons out of his last 18.

Canfield’s first job will be to try to
replace the gap in the frontcourt left
by the graduation of John Lee
Graves. Graves, who finished as the
seventh-leading scorer on the Gene-
rals all-time list, averaged 20 points
and 7.9 rebounds per game, leading
the team in both categories.

To fill the void left by Graves, Can-
field will look mainly to senior co-

captain Scott Shannon. Shannon, who
averaged 8.7 points and 6.6 rebounds
last year, will have to increase both
of those figures (especially the re-
bounding) in order for the Generals
to be successful this year.

Joining the 6-5 Shannon in the
frontcourt will most likely be 6-4
sophomore Rob Spencer. Spencer
looked impressive last year when he
did play, and will be counted upon to
help Shannon on the boards. The Gen-
erals were hurt up front, however,
when forward Keith Brideweser, a
freshman last year who averaged 7.3
points per game, transfered.

Other names to watch for up front
will be sophomore Jefferson Harral-
son, and freshmen Steve Alby, Gary
Schott, Louis Trosch, Swen Vokel and
Harmon Harden.

Moving to the backcourt, the situa-
tion is completely different. Canfield
has five senior guards to choose
from, all of whom have shown that
they can play. An added bonus is the
return of Bill Yates. Yates, who was
not at W&L last year, averaged 14.4
points per game in 1982-83. He was
the Generals’ best outside shooter as
a sophomore and junior, and could be
W&L’s main offensive weapon this
year.

Joining Yates at the other starting
guard position will most likely be co-

captain Kevin McClatchey. McClat-
chey, who came from nowhere to
claim to starting berth last year, pos-
esses great floor sense and savvy,
and also averaged 9.3 points per
game last year.

Canfield will not hesitate in going
to his bench this year, however, es-
pecially in the backcourt. Senior
Dave Wilkinson will be contending
for a starting job, and Mike Hudson
will also see a good deal of time.

One of the key players for the Gen-
erals will be senior swingman Lex
Fitzenhagen. Fitzenhagen, who was
the Generals second-leading scorer
(12.2) last year before undergoing
knee surgery, is probably the most
physically talented player on the
team. With the Generals’ depth at
guard, he figures to see most of his
action up front.

Because of the team’s lack of size,
look for the Generals to use a three-
guard lineup much of the time, with
Fitzenhagen filling the third guard
spot. This will enable W&L to put its
good ball-handlers on the floor, whick
should neutralize some deficiencies
in size and speed.

Defensively, Canfield has shown
that he likes to pressure the ball a lot,
often anywhere on the court. This
year, the Generals have the person-
nel to do this. Yates and McClatchey

are both tough one-on-one defensive
players, and Mike Hudson, a defen-
sive specialist, will also be a key in
this department.

W&L will not be a particularly fast
or big team this year, so the Generals
will have to rely on patience on of-
fense and heavy ball pressure on de-
fense.

Overall, the Generals should have
a very successful year. Fundamen-
tals, teamwork and discipline, espec-
ially on defense, will tell the story. As
Canfield said, “‘We will win with our
defense, and this year I feel we have
the people who can play it.”

Harrier Pittman qualifies for Nationals

By STEVE CREENEBAUM

Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee cross
country team’s season came to an
abrupt finish last Saturday in the
NCAA Division III regionals. The
Generals’ fourth-place finish ended
the season team-wise, but captain
Frank Pittman brightened the day
with his ninth-place finish, qualifying
him for the national championships
this Saturday.

The Generals were favored to fin-
ish in the top two team spots, qualify-
ing them as a team for nationals. The
other finishers were Ted Meyer in
18th place, David Andrews in 2ist
and Bill Clark in 28th. The team

didn’t run as tight as it had
throughout the season.
“Some guys ran well,” said Pitt-

man. ‘‘But the team as a whole didn’t
pull together like it had during our
season.”

Pittman’s bid to nationals can be
attributed in large part to the accom-
plishments of last year’s W&L cross
country All-American Angus
McBryde. McBryde's strong perfor-
mance last year earned the South-
Southeast Region an extra at-large
bid for this year. That extra bid was
the one earned by Pittman.

There were many things that made
last Saturday different from the rest
of the season; first of all, rain. A
reported five inches of standing
water was all over the course. There
were about 95-100 runners and a large

crowd in attendance. The course it-
self was flat with rolling hills, noth-
ing special, according to the team.
Even with the let down of not mak-
ing Nationals, the 1984 cross country
team has nothing to be ashamed of.
They had many historic moments:

14-0, the first undefeated team in the
32 years with coach Miller, his 200th
victory, and by the end of the season
he had 208. And finally, they became
the 1984 Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Champions. A season full of
shut-outs and controlled victories.

Pittman is the remaining chance
for the Generals. If Pittman finishes
in the top 25 he will become an All-
American. How does Pittman feel
about this Saturday?

“I’m scared to death, there is a lot
of pressure to do well.”’

Polo closes season at 18-14-1

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water
polo team finished the 1984 season
with an eighth place finish at the
Eastern Championships at West
Point last weekend.

The Generals (18-14-1 in 1984) suf-
fered three losses last weekend. W&L
lost to top seeded Brown 18-6, Iona
10-9 and Harvard 8-3.

“IT thought we played well. We did
some things that we have not been
able to do all year,’’ said head coach
Page Remillard. Remillard added,
‘‘We were able to coach situations
and call plays last weekend. Our in-
experience, however, hurt us some.”

Referring to his team’s inexper-
ience, Remillard said that six of his
players had never played water polo
before this year. He explained, ‘‘To
get inexperienced players to play
competitively is the first step. The
second step is to win.”’

Remillard said that his team made
a lot of progress during the season
and he hopes to begin next year

where he finished this year. Coach
Remillard believes that next year’s
team will have no problem doing
that.

Evaluating the Generals’ 1984 cam-
paign, Remillard said, ‘I am not dis-
appointed at all with this season. I
isn’t a season that you want every
year.”’ Not denying the 1984 team’s
success, Remillard explained that
once you finish second, you want to
be number one.

In 1984, W&L was unable to win the
Southern League for its fourth conse-
cutive conference title. Although the
Generals did not capture the title,
this year, they did place seoond.

Concerning All-American honors,
Remillard stated that W&L has two
major candidates. He said that 1983
All-American Tim Stanford has play-
ed great all season and that Senior
Bobby Pearson has played with the
best this year also.

Before the 1984 season started,
some people had labeled this year’s
campaign as a rebuilding year. With
the successful rebuilding year behind

t

him, Remillard looks to the future
saying that it looks very encourag-
ing.

Remember
what really

is important

.... The headlines splattered across
Monday’s editions of those two Vir-
ginia papers prevalent in these parts
(I’m talking sports sections. Some-
how the other stuff doesn’t make it
through breakfast) were less than
flattering upon the state of sport-
swriters when it comes to the human
compassion scale.

To recount the situation, before I go off half-cocked per usual, ina
NASCAR race on Sunday, a driver was killed in what has been deemed

a “freak accident” when his car spun out of control coming out of a
ton and rammed into an enbankment. Repeat: A driver was killed.

What we got from the sportswriters was a little me more than I just
told you: his name (Tim Schoonover) and the fact that he was a
rookie. Repeat: A driver was killed.

Granted, auto racing is not the most media blitzed of sports events,
and granted, as well, that the Schoonover wreck was the first in the
Grand National Race since 1975. But a little more than a paragraph
and a half, and then we go to something like, ‘‘Meanwhile, Earnhardt
had widened his lead to 13 seconds.”’ Repeat: A driver was killed.

I think the treatment of this story by the press in these instances
Was less than acceptable. Have we become (and this most certainly
includes you and me, the readers) so callous in our concern for win-
ning and losing that we no longer have time to care for such trivialities
as someone being killed in a sporting event? I don’t care if he’s playing
football, racing boats or climbing mountains. Death in any form of
athletic competition is something we have to stand up and take notice
of.

And I’m not asking us to take notice of it in the fashion of calling for
an immediate end to this cruel activity. No, not at all (man’s too cor-
rupt a species to allow for the elimination of such activities that bring
its participants so close to the edge of life—or is that death? )

Rather, what I’m asking is that we look at some sports such as auto
racing, boxing, football, etc., for what they really are and what they
really can do (read: kill their participants, a loaded phrase, indeed). A
death in a sporting event is not something we push off in a sentence or
two as if it were bad weather or a sparse crowd. Unfortunately, that’s
more like it was handled.

I’m not asking us to print the sports pages in white on black when
something like this happens. Let’s just realize that the death of an
athlete in a game, match, race or whatever is something that needs to
be dealt with in terms more worthy of the subject matter. Let the
reader know what happened, why it happened, to whom it happened
and what it means about the sport. If it’s not rated properly by sports-
writers in the first place, we’re all in danger of losing touch with
what’s really important: it’s not the game or its outcome, it’s the peo-
ple who play that should be the story.....

... Turning to the Colonnade, it was good to see the footballers finish
strong. Depending on the recruiting year, 1985 looks promising at this
point....Five inches of water to run in are not conditions worthy of this
year’s cross country team. An unfortunate end, but one that does not
diminish their spotless performance this fall. Best of luck to captain
Frank Pittman in Akron at nationals....0ther W&L whisperings:
Cagers get underway Friday and Saturday. This group looks strong
enough (yes, I’ll say it) to keep Ed Green from smiling...And here’s a
note for fans of national championships: W&L will host the Division III
Tennis Championships this May....

...Hey, that flap last Friday night in Boston Garden between the
once-respected above all others (in my book) Julius Erving and Larry
Bird was inexcusable. So Bird runs all over you one night, Doc. No
need to have your big friends hold him down while you drive three
rights to his chin. You’re a much bigger human being than that. A for-
mal and public apology is requested....

...And this thought as you head home for turkey, mom, dad and
whoever else is waiting with open arms: Can you imagine any NFL
team coming back from 31 points down at halftime? It’s ludicrous. I
thought all NFL games went on automatic pilot once a team was down
by 20. It doesn’t happen that way in college, and that’s why it’s a better

Ruggers’ fall season
ends with MWC win

The Washington and Lee rugby
team defeated Mary Washington Sat-
urday in the final match of its fall
season by a score of 15-10. The win
gave W&L its sixth win against 3
losses this fall.

W&L opened the scoring against
Mary Washington as Ward Davis and
John Miller worked to get the ball to
Pete Papasavas, who ran 40 meters
for the score. David Arthur added the
two-point kick to put W&L in front
early, 6-0

Mary Washington came back with
two tries to take the lead, 10-6 as the
first conversion kick failed.

The W&L ruggers were minus the
services of captain Bill Jones as he
helped the Virginia Rugby Union’s
select side defeat a similar squad
from the Potomac Rugby Union in
Washington, But the absence of
Jones was not a stumbling block to
the W&L comeback efforts.

David Arthur kicked a difficult
field goal in the wind to cut the Mary
Washington lead to three, and the

game winner for W&L came just a
few minutes later when Papasavas
picked up a Miller pop-kick without
breaking stride and scored his sec-

ond try.

W&L collected its other victories
over U.Va., James Madison, Hamp-
den-Sydney, Old Dominion and VMI.
Their losses came at the hands of the
Roanoke Rugby Union and a pair
from VMI.

“It’s the best season since I’ve
been here,’ Jones, a junior, said.
Jones’ play on the Virginia Select
Side continues this weekend and next
with matches scheduled in Philadel-
phia and Delaware.

Scoring leaders during the fall for
the squad included Jones, Arthur,
Davis, Papasavas and P.J. lerardi.

Rugby play is expected to start
again the first week in March. Jones

said there are plans for the team to ,

go on a trip during the spring break,
but nothing definite has been arrang-
ed yet.
