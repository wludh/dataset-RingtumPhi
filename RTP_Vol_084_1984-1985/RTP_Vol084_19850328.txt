IFC approves Rush calendar;

plan now faces UC, SAC votes

 

From Staff Reports

 

The proposed fraternity Rush

_ calendar for next fall delays Rush un-

til after freshman orientation and
prohibits Wednesday night parties
during the 18-day formal Rush
period.

The proposal, approved unani-
mously by the Interfraternity Coun-
cil on Tuesday, was scheduled to be
reviewed this afternoon by the Uni-
versity Council and the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“We've worked out what we
thought were the main problems with
last year’s calendar,” incoming IFC
President Jaimie Hayne said. ‘‘It’s a
little less restrictive and everything
is more spread out.”’

Additional highlights of the IFC's
plan:

eWashington and Lee women
would be permitted at all Rush func-
tions except Open Houses, but wo-
men from other schools would not be
allowed to attend formal Rush fune-
tions.

eTwo bands costing a total of $2,700
would be permitted.

eFreshmen would have two nights

Police officer
files appeal
of conviction

Staff Reporter

 

A Lexington police officer who was
convicted Friday in a closed hearing
of the assault and battery of a 17-
year-old has appealed his conviction.

Sgt. Richard S. Rice, 44, a member
of the Lexington police force for 212
years, was sentenced to two months
in jail by Judge Robert T. Culpepper
of the Lexington Juvenile and Do-
mestic Relations Court. Ten months
of the one-year sentence were sus-
pended.

Rice was released on his own
recognizance, according to General
District Clerk Juanita Rice.

Rice, reached Monday at his Rock-
bridge County home, said he had ap-
pealed the ruling but declined further
comment.

A Lexington General District Court
official confirmed the appeal was fil-
ed Friday. The new trial will be
heard in Rockbridge County Circuit
Court.

Police Chief L.O. Sutton said he
suspended Rice without pay immed-
iately after hearing of the incident in
early January. He added he would
make a decision this week concern-
ing Rice’s future with the police de-
partment.

Rice was charged Jan. 8 in the Jan
1 incident.

According to Commonwealth's At-

torney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read, the
juvenile was convicted of assault ona
policeman stemming from the New
Year’s Eve incident.

Read said he disqualified himself
from prosecuting Rice because he
had prosecuted the juvenile and Rice
had been a witness in that case. Au-
gusta County Commonwealth’s At
torney Lee Ervin was special pro-
secutor

Open Houses.

The SAC, a student-faculty com-
mittee that has ‘‘complete authority”
over University social life, must ap-
prove the entire calendar, and the
UC, an advisory student-faculty com-
mittee, must approve the pledging
date, according to Hayne.

He said that although ‘‘it’s usually
just a formality,” this year there
may be a few aiterations. “There'll
probably be a few things that are
changed, but it'll probably be basic-
ally the same,"’ Hayne said

He said the ban on Wednesday
night parties should go ‘‘really far”
in helping the entire proposal receive
SAC approval

“That's something we felt we
would make as a concession,’’ Hayne
said, ‘‘We’re using that as a bargain-
ing point, and all the fraternities
were willing togiveitup.”’

He added that the advantages of
the restriction are that it ‘‘will cut
down on noise in the community,”
and will satisfy those who feel Wed-
nesday night parties have negative
effects on students.

The proposed formal Rush period
is four days longer than last year’s

This fall, contact began on Sept. 3
and preference cards were due Sept.
17, next fall, contact begins Sept. 13
and preference cards are due Sept.
30.

The IFC’s plan also calls for two
weeks of Rush during classes rather
than this year’s one, since contact
begins after orientation rather than
classes on the second day, as it did
this fall

Hayne said the slightly delayed
start should be helpful to new stu-
dents. ‘‘One of the biggest problems
people talked about last year was
that freshmen went blind into the
open houses,” he said. ‘This gives
them some kind of idea what houses
they want tosee first.”’

He noted an additional benefit to
delaying Rusn a few days. ‘‘When
Rush starts right off the bat, the
freshmen get involved with that and
think they should be partying instead
of studying,”’ he said.

The eight Open Houses last one
hour each and the 10 Rush Dates are
scheduled for 1!» hours each.

Cold Check writes
bad check for $73

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Student Financial Relations
Committee, which reimburses local
merchants when Washington and Lee
students bounce checks, two weeks
ago made the same mistake for
which it fines students — it bounced a
check.

The check was for $73.58 to The
Palms restaurant and was dated
March 7. Junior Henry Exall, chair-
man of the cold check committee, as
itis better known, said the check was
one of six written to reimburse mer-
chants in a week in which the com-
mittee thought it had $800, when in
fact ithad only $300.

Exall claimed full responsibility
for the error. He said that if the
bounced check were brought before
the committee, he would probably
not be fined because he wrote the
check ‘‘in good faith,’’ thinking there
was enough money tocover it.

The Executive Committee ques-
tioned Exall Monday night. Junior
representative Pat Hayden said the
bounced check was ‘‘quite an embar-
rassment.”’

“It just destroys their credibility,
in my mind,” Hayden said after the
meeting. Hayden asked rhetorically
how the committee can berate and

fine students who chee!
when it does the same thing itselt

‘** ‘How can he who has no sin cast
the first stone?’ if you want to quot
the Bible,’ Hayden continued

He added that the bounced check
reflects poorly on the committee and
indirectly, the EC, because the E‘
appoints the cold check committee
chairman

After the EC meeting Exail ex
plained that on March 7, treasure!
Jim Murphy failed to bring
year’s checkbook to the committee's
weekly meeting. When
checks for the six other committee
members to take to the merchant:
who were asking for reimbursement
that week, Exall wrote them on last
year’s checkbook, thinking it was
this year’s. That checkbook showed a
balance of $800, when the commit
tee’s real balance was $295.80

“If we had ever assumed the
balance was as low as it was, we
never would have written the
checks,”’ Exall told the EC

He said he should have been able to
tell it was the wrong checkbook. so it
was his fault.

Two Washington and Lee students
were arrested this morning after a
Lexington police officer entered the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity house
about 2 a.m. in an attempt to end a
party there, Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said.

David J. Cox, an 18-year-old Delt
freshman from Potomac, Md., was
charged with being drunk in public
and with disorderly conduct.

Timothy D. Walker, a 20-year-old

Horse Center ‘race’ ends

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Throughout the yearlong fight
to bring the Virginia Horse Center
to Rockbridge County, the puns
were endless as observers tracked
the progress:

Rockbridge County broke out of
the gate in its bid to attract the
Virginia Horse Center....

Rockbridge County's bid to at-
tract the
cleared another hurdle....

Rockbridge County galloped
toward the finish line in its bid....

If the battle over the location of
the horse center could be com-
pared to a race, Friday repre
sented the awarding of the first-
place check and the placing of the
wreath of roses around the winn-
ing horse’s neck

While nearly 4,000 people looked
on at Virginia Military Institute’s
Cameron Hall, Gov. Charles S.
Robb on Friday signed the bill
creating the horse center on 361
acres of land near the intersection
of Interstates 64 and 81

‘In a few years, when people
talk about horses and they talk
about Lexington, they’re going to
be talking about Lexington, Vir
ginia, and not that other Lex
ington’ in Kentucky, Robb said at
what was billed as the state’s
largest bill-signing ceremony

Robb praised the cooperation
among the governing bodies of the
county and its cities as a crucial
factor in bringing the horse center
to Rockbridge. Rockbridge was
selected over areas such as Roa
noke and Staunton

A court date for the misdemeanor

Because it is ‘of an evidentiary

charges. ‘‘Bascially all of it was ver

Sutton said Joines came to the Delt
house about 2 a.m. because the stu

“In my entire service as gover

efforts of G. Otis Mead III, who
led the local committee that lob

“Otis and his

The center will be the site of

OPINION

 

Consider this

The bulk of next year’s Executive Committee has been
elected. The Big Three elections are in the past, and banners
from this week’s six undergraduate positions up for election
are beginning to disappear. But while the adrenaline is still
flowing and thoughts are still on the duties of the student
governing body, there are a few things we believe ought to be
emphasized.

Next year’s EC obviously will play a crucial role in the
history of the University. Besides helping to ease the transi-
tion to coeducation, next year’s EC will face other
challenges.

First and most importantly, we hope the Executive
Committee next year will undertake an extensive study of the
Honor System. A re-evaluation of the single-sanction rule is
mandated in light of rumblings from faculty members that it
is impractical. Perhaps an extensive study of student opinion
about the Honor System is also in order. Does the seeming
lull in criticism of the Honor System mean students approve?
Does silence equal consent? Since change is in the air for
next year, might this be another area in which change is
needed?

Secondly, we hope they again address the problem of alco-
hol abuse, especially in light of the recent tragedy involving
SAE. Will the student body be able to create an environment
under the new 21-year-old drinking age that promotes the
concept of honor and gentlemanly conduct while allowing
students to continue to enjoy an active social life?

Third, as was evident at Monday night’s EC meeting, re-
form of the current methods of allocating money to student
organizations should be considered. We seriously question
whether every student group coming before the EC is deserv-
ing of money. Qualms, come March, over whether there is
enough money in the EC reserve fund should not matter if
sound budgeting has been pursued.

Next year’s EC will offer a lot to the University in firsts.
We hope they take up the challenge of past committees and
pursue excellence in representation. Stripping away the pop-
ular misconception that EC members merely seek resume
fodder will be a challenge we hope they’!l confront with vigor.

A big waste

It was one of those envelopes that has a computer label on
it, and the mimeographed letter inside began with the com-
mon form letter salutation, “To All Students.’’ The careful
reader finds out that the Student Control Committee chair-
man, B. Darby Brower, is writing underclassmen to inform
them of the role class officers play in the SCC. The letter
seems timely, considering the elections this week for the
various Class officer positions.

Brower continues in the most eloquent of prose to delineate
the ‘‘exact responsibilities” of the group, which “has been
delegated by the faculty the power to try students who may
have committed a non-honor related offense.”’ His well-writ-
ten letter continues for the full page and ends with the friend-
ly admonition that B. Darby Brower would ‘appreciate your
consideration of this information when voting on your
classmates for class officers.”

The only problem is that Brower, whether out of ignorance
or intent, had written the letter on Student Control Commit-
tee letterhead, which lists two of the current members who
also were up for election as underclassmen. Such advertise-
ment gives the two candidates an unfair advantage in their
campaigns and lends an air of authority and authenticity to
their candidacies that is not available to other candidates.
Mistake number one.

_ Mistake number two involves the misuse of University dol-
lars to mail the letter. With 1,014 undergraduates on the mail-
ing list (seniors obviously were not voting), at 22 cents a let-
ter, the total comes to more than $225 including printing
costs! Surely, ina time of cutting budgets with the vengeance
of recent days, better use for the money could have been
found, Other means, including this paper’s letters column
and posters around campus, could have achieved the same
end. Judging from the stack of unopened letters in the post of-
fice trash can, mailing the notices did not seem to be the best
solution. In using a different medium, B. Darby Brower also
could have avoided the conflict of interest that resulted.

Woman pities The Phi

 

To the Editors:

When I first read the article ‘“‘The
Bid’’ in the Feb. 28 issue of The Ring-
tum Phi I was furious, then after
thinking about it I felt pity. My first
pity was for the Washington and Lee
students who ultimately did get used
— and abused — for just a date to
Fancy Dress. My second pity was for
The Phi.

This college newspaper, which has
come so far in its layout and size, just
took two giant steps backwards in its
quality. Any first-year journalism
student knows that a reporter must
report the facts and report them in an
unopinionated manner. There are no
facts in this lead: ‘‘It was no coinci-
dence that Mary Baldwin College
threw an expensive party with Liquid
Pleasure Tuesday night. The party’s
purpose? The Bid.”’

Did anyone from The Phi research

The Phi last week contained a
passage stating that student body
Vice President-elect Andrew Car-
uthers said ‘‘some of the problems
this year stemmed from the way
the EC was run.’’ The sentence
should have made clear that
‘‘problems’’ was a reference to
problems perceived by others and

 

this opinion? Did anyone contact the
planners of the party, MBC’s Social
Committee, to check the validity of
this statement?

Obviously not, and after talking to
the chairwoman of the Social Com-
mittee at Mary Baldwin, I found that
The Phi lied. THAT isa fact.

I ceriainly hope that the writers for
The Ring-tum Phi do not go on to
write for reputable newspapers in the
future. It could be very damaging to
the paper, to themselves and to the
parties they defame.

Maybe some of the writers of The
Ring-tum Phi would learn a little
about journalism if they took a News-
writing I class at Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

U.S. security challenged from abroad

MY
VIEW

By Jon
Zagrodzky

 

You will recall that in my last arti-
cle, I defined what I perceived to be
the four basic foreign threats faced
by the United States. These are the
Soviet threat and the threats posed
by other nations, including conven-
tional and economic warfare as well
as terrorism. Before expounding on
the last three categories, however, I
should like to address the concerns
some readers expressed about my
last column.

The comment that I heard most
was that I was representing an isola-
tionist point of view. Some claimed
the same foolish thinking that tried to
keep us ‘out of European conflicts in
the periods before the two World
Wars. This would be true if it were
1940 and not 1985. We must remem-
ber the key factors that have chang-
ed in the last 45 years to answer this
question.

First, the amount of time we have
to mobilize troops to meet a Soviet
conventional strike has gone from
about a year to about a day. The
speed at which a war would progress
these days is so fast that we must
maintain in Europe at all times all
the forces we would need in a conven-
tional war. To provide this, a sub-
stantial sacrifice by the American
people, one much larger than the one
we are now making, is necessary.
The gist of my first article is that the
total sacrifice needed to defend
Europe falls unfairly on U.S. should-
ers. We can and should maintain a
nuclear deterrent, but the burden of
conventional defense should shift to
the Europeans.

A second factor that influences our
position is the outcome of the Viet-

 

nam War. This conflict brought to
light two dilemmas, the first being
that logistics in a modern overseas
war are insurmountable and second,
that U.S. public willingness to
sacrifice American lives in protract-
ed conventional conflicts is limited.

The last key factor is the big
changes in relative U.S. military and
economic strength since World War
II. We no longer possess the tremen-
dous economic strength needed to
provide for Europe’s complete de-
fense; indeed, the economic strength
needed for our own defense is
diminishing. Second, the relatively
weak posture of the Soviet Bloc in the
late ’40s made European defense an
easy burden to bear. Today, though,
we face an enormously more power-
ful adversary and must deal with it
from a relatively weaker economic
position. Clearly, a transfer of the
conventional defense burden to
Europe will improve European
defense in the long run (both strateg-
ically and logistically) and relieve
the U.S. of a conventional commit-
ment it cannot possibly meet. Isola-
tionism is avoided, since we will con-
tinue to provide a nuclear defense as
well as some degree of material
assistance.

Now it seems as if I have shown
that the U.S. should not maintain con-
ventional forces. On the contrary, the
other threats to our nation have not
yet been addressed. First, apart
from the Soviet Union, we must al-
ways remember that other countries
can adversely affect our security.
These nations do not pose a direct
threat to our borders but, rather,
seek to subvert our neighbors and use
them as bases to launch revolutions
hostile to the U.S. Obviously, a strong
conventional force composed of Ma-
rines, a flexible Navy with the capac-
ity to project power into troubled
areas and a superior Air Force are
all needed to halt these kinds of
developments as well as to threaten
those who wish to perpetrate such
subversion. These same conventional

Note wastes student dollars

Tothe Editors:

I returned from a weekend away
from Lexington, to find letters ad-
dressed to me and five other people I
live with in the mailbox. The letter I
am speaking of is the sincere letter
from B. Darby Brower, Senior Class
President, Chairman S.C.C. I won-
dered if my student tax dollars paid
for this mailing. Even if they did not,
somebody wasted his money. The
contents of the letter seemed superfi-
cial. Does Mr. Brower feel that the
student body is ignorant of the SCC’s
responsibilities? Did he feel that it
was worth the expense to write us all
a letter asking us to vote carefully? I
believe that if Mr. Brower posted 25
copies of his letter at various places
around campus, he would have had
the same influence. (My five other
roommates did not even bother to
open their letters.) I feel Mr. B. Dar-
by and the other SCC members who
approved the letter went too far out
of their way with our money to in-

form us of a matter which could have

been handled more easily and effi-

ciently. Let’s hope we did vote

carefully. Let’s hope we kept people
of this nature out of office.

Unlocked doors tempt fate

Tothe Editors:

I have worked as Proctor at Wash-
ington and Lee University since 1959.
No one at this University believes in
the Honor System more than I do,
But you cannot go off and leave your
doors unlocked, leaving things out in
the open to entice someone. Out-
siders are in and out of our dor-
mitories a lot. I have caught quite a
few of them in my time. I have also
caught students forging checks and
stealing money. This school is getting
larger and there are more things to
look after.

Burr Datz and I cannot stay in the
dormitories and watch your belong-
ings all of the time. Most of the time

freshmen and dorm counselors will

people, who do not belong here, go in
and no one says a word to them. This
seems to happen more often when
there is a big weekend or break.

Most of you who come here want to
be treated like grown-ups, but you go
off to a party and leave your room
open as if to say, ‘‘The hell wi
everything, my good times come
first.”’ If everyone who lives in our
dorms will try to be a little more
careful about things when leaving, it
will be better for all of us.

lating conflict with the USSR and
should be designed for and used in
conflicts with lesser nations.

The third area of conflict is in
economics. The U.S. is threatened
economically by OPEC, potential
Third World debt default and in-
creasing foreign trade competition.
While not all of these threats are in-

less. The best policy is to maintain a
flexible economy, prevent trade wars
and avoid policies that might desta-
bbilize our economic position. These
bad policies include haphazard len-
ding by the banking community,
domestic energy pricing schemes
that maintain consumption and shore
up OPEC revenues and labor agree-
ments that permit marginal labor
cost increases without commen-
surate increases in productivity.

To the Editors:

The current discussion regarding
the proposed abolishment of ‘“‘nice-
ties’? — the 24-hour-open library,
closing the classrooms at night and
the annual Catalogue — is an inter-
esting one. I have two points to make
— one to the administration and one
to the student body.

First, Washington and Lee is pri-
marily a great academic institution
and the pursuit of knowledge on a
liberal arts level should not be limit-
ed by constraints of time. Closing the
library at a certain time would lead
to increased pressure on the
students, and would also create the
problem of undergrads flocking to
the Law School, which will probably
remain open 24 hours a day. Rather
than increasing the sense of com-
munity between the two schools, such
a policy may lead toan ‘‘us vs. them”
attitude that existed 10 years ago
when the library was locked and we

  

and deadly. We have been fortunate
in that terrorist attacks are rare in
the U.S., even though our society is so
open that any terrorist could easily
get away with destroying vast
amounts of property. As evidence of
this, take a look at the lax security
provisions typical of any of the south-
east Texas oil refineries. Evidently,
our preventive measures in this area
are adequate, and we can only hope
that our luck holds out and that har-
sher measures by the FBI and other
internal security forces will not be
necessary.

The United States, in my opinion,
faces great challenges to its security
from abroad. I am convinced that it
has the resources and flexibility to
meet them more effectively than it
does currently. If U.S. policy makers
could separate the foreign threats in-
to the four categories I have outlined
and attack them individually, their
foreign policy would be less compli-
cated, less costly and substantially
more effective.

flocked into Tucker Hall to finish the
“all-night’’ term paper.

Second, although open libraries
and classrooms are “necessities to
W&L’s atmosphere’ and ‘‘founda-
tions to the W&L experience,” they
are not rights, but rather privileges
that have to be earned by each suc-
ceeding student generation. Appar-
ently, the school must tighten its belt
a little to continue to provide services
to the students, and the students can
help in this effort by conserving
energy, turning off lights when
rooms aren’t used and using the
stairs instead of the elevator. If
students show a willingness and the
ability to cut back on wasteful prac-
tices, the administration’s argument
will prove quite weak over a short
period of time.

-IFC president wants
frats to be more active

=

*-

«,

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The new president of the Inter-
fraternity Council says he plans to
heighten the IFC’s profile, attempt to
involve fraternities in more commu-
nity activities and increase fraterni-
ty awareness of University issues
and IFC regulations,

Junior Jaimie Hayne, who was
elected president two weeks ago, also
recently was chosen president of the
Washington and Lee chapter of Kap-
pa Alpha. Hayne, a history major
from San Antonio, Texas, is the out-
going secretary of the IFC and has
served on the Student Recruitment
Committee.

Not only does increased fraternity
involvement in community activities
benefit the community, Hayne said,
but it is helpful to the IFC and the
fraternities as well.

It can “get us a better name
around town and also around cam-
pus,”’ he said, adding that the pri-
mary exposure the fraternities have
in town comes on Wednesday nights
and weekends when many houses
throw parties. Performing more ser-
vices for the community and con-
tributing to charities can help to
dispel this image, Hayne said.

Another project Hayne wants the
IFC to more involve itself in next
year is the scholarship help it offers
foreign exchange students. The IFC
pays the room and board for four
years for certain exchange students.
“This year we only gave out one,”’ he
said. ‘Hopefully, next year we'll
have two.”’

Helping with the transition to coed-
ucation is another area in which
Hayne believes the IFC can be help-
ful. Although the fraternities are
strictly for male students, Hayne
said the IFC wants to do ‘‘everything
we can to assimilate girls into the
social life’ next fall. As part of this
assimilation, Hayne said he hopes to
hold a meeting during orientation
week for the incoming female fresh-
men to explain to them the status of
sorority interest in W&L and to let
them know what it takes to start a
sorority chapter.

The IFC is cooperating with the Co-
education Steering Committee on
this issue, but Hayne sees a problem
in another area the two groups have
discussed — Rush. The steering com-
mittee is worried, Hayne said, that
the present Rush schedule might
split the freshman class. With frater-
nity Rush coming at the start of fall

term, Hayne said the committee -.

feels Rush will cause the freshman
class to polarize — the men will be
too concerned with Rush to associate
and become acquainted with the wo-

men in the class. Hayne calls this
idea ‘‘ridiculous.”’

A deferred Rush is one of the issues
that may come before the IFC in the
near future. ‘‘There are some vocal
factions on campus that want to
change Rush to second semester,”’
Hayne said. These groups are outside
of the fraternity system, he contin-
ued, and he thinks fraternities would
prefer to have Rush remain sched-
uled as itis.

Hayne concedes there are pro-
blems with the way Rush is set up
now. Many of the freshmen, he said,
went into the process ‘“‘totally blind’
last fall. Some were not able, in the
short time that Rush was conducted,
to make an intelligent decision
among fraternities.

The IFC has several proposals to
combat this ignorance among incom-
ing freshman, Hayne said, including
imposing the ‘‘no contact”’ rule dur-
ing orientation week and beginning
Rush on the first day of classes. (See
related story, Page 1.)

Next fall’s Rush will be a very im-
portant one, Hayne said, because
with the shrinking number of males
in the freshman class, maintaining
the current size of some of the frater-
nities may be difficult.

Hayne said that next year he will
try to encourage more fraternity
presidents to attend IFC meetings.
With the importance of issues such as
Rush, he would like to see more peo-
ple involved and offering their ideas.

Hayne alsosaid that he plans torun
the IFC more ‘‘by the book”’ than it
was run this year. There were in-
stances this year, he said, in which
certain rules were overlooked by the
IFC. Fraternities need tc realize that
there are rules, Hayne added, ‘‘and
that there’s a purpose for those
rules.”’

One rule that he said he saw broken
last year was the ‘“‘no contact’’ rule
during Rush. That rule is important,
he said, as are others, and he plans to
enforce them next year.

Among its duties next year, the
IFC will be reviewing the recommen-
dations of the ad hoc committee on
fraternities. The committee’s recom-
mendations were studied this year by
the IFC, Hayne said, and afterward,
the IFC submitted a proposal for im-
provement of the fraternity system.
Included in this proposal were re-
commendations that fraternities be-
come better acquainted with their
faculty advisers, that all rooms in the
fraternity houses be occupied and
that more upperclassmen live in the
houses with the sophomores.

Another issué-raised in the ad hoc
committee’s report was the Wednes-
day night party regulations and the
question of time, manner and place
of weekend parties. This year’s re-

row for the committee, resulting in
an unusually low balance, he added.

Connie Hostetter, the Palms man-
ager who received the committee’s
bounced check, said this week that
because this was the first time it has
happened, she is not worried.

‘‘We thought maybe it’s just some
simple mistake,”’ she said. ‘‘We real-
ly understand, and it’s no problem at
gu

She said that at Exall’s request she
has sent the check back tothe bank,

“If it happens again or it comes
back to me a second time, then we
might get a little worried,’’ she said.

Another problem the EC says Cold
Check has faced this year has been
one of communication between it and
they merchants. Currently, mer-
chants who receive bounced checks
call University Center secretary
Carole Chappell, who leaves the com-
mittee’s messages in its University
Center mailbox.

Exall said that because the com-
mittee meets only once a week and
the committee members wait a few
days before going out to pay mer-
chants, there can be a delay of up to
two weeks from a merchant's first

 

complaint to the time he is paid.

This can result in merchants’ call-
ing Chappell two and three times
with the same complaint, Exall said,
making those involved believe there
is a breakdownin communications.

“T think Carole’s doing a terrific
job,” Exall said. “Probably the
reason she thinks the messages are
piling up is the merchants keep call-
ing.”’

He said the treasurer will start go-
ing around to the committee’s fre-
quent customers — Lloyd’s, The
Palms and Spanky’s — between
meetings to find out if they have
bounced checks before they call
Chappell.

Sophomore EC representative An-
drew Caruthers suggested that the
committee pick up its messages from
Chappell every other day, rather
than just the day of the meeting.

Hayden suggested that only one
person be allowed to write checks,
because currently both Exall and
Murphy handle the checkbook and
that could result in another bounced
check.

Exall said he will begin to ask mer-
chants to include a ‘‘ballpark figure”’
of the amount of their bounced
checks in messages to Chappell. Cur-
rently Exall writes each week’s
checks without filling in the amount,
increasing the possibility of bounced
checks.

 

 

 

JAIMIE HAYNE
Plans to run IFC “by the book”’

strictions, which prohibited fraterni-
ties from having parties together on
campus on Wednesday nights, drove
many houses to seek party spots out-
side of town. In addition to the var-
ious country houses fraternity mem-
bers live in, Hayne said, a popular
spot for parties was Zollman’s pavi-
lion.

The one-house party rule, Hayne
said, means that more fraternities
are partying alone in their own
houses more frequently. This only
serves to work against the idea that
reducing the number of fraternities
partying together will reduce the
wear and tear on the houses, he said.
This system also tends to split frater-
nities, he added. Wednesday nights
are a time when many friends from
different houses can get together, he
said, and not allowing them to have
parties together does more to sep-
arate houses than tounify them.

With the recent death in an auto-
mobile wreck of a student returning
from a party outside town, Hayne
said he agreed with Dean of Students
Lewis G. John’s statement that it
might be a good idea to re-evaluate
these regulations.

Decisions such as these that affect
student life should not be taken light-
ly, Hayne said. With 65 to 70 percent
of W&L students in fraternities,
Hayne said they are ‘‘a force to be
reckoned with’’ and should not be
excluded from participating in these
decisions.

Total students

Applicants for Honor Scholarships up 300%

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

The students arrived late on a Tuesday afternoon and

then gathered that evening for a welcoming address
from Director of Admissions William M. Hartog III.

 

The number of applicants for Honor Scholarships next
year increased more than threefold to 365, resulting in
some high school class valedictorians not even being
selected as finalists, admissions officials said this week.

The Admissions Office narrowed the applicants for the
12 scholarships — including one specifically for a woman
— to 40 finalists, who visited the campus for interviews

during the past two weeks.

“We're looking for the total student,’’ Admissions
Counselor Bennett L. Ross said. ‘‘The scholarships are

not just academic scholarships.”’

Ross said recipients of the awards must be well-round-
ed, outstanding students and leaders. Extracurricular
activities and personal characteristics, he said, are im-

portant factors.

The University paid all travel expenses to bring the 40
finalists to campus for a series of interviews. Some were

from as far away as California.

“We're attracting a nationwide pool,”’ Ross said. ‘‘Itis
expensive, but it’s money well spent.”’

“These kids will get ineverywhere,’’ he added.

Ross said that based on past experience, admissions
officials expect about half of the finalists to enroll at

WA&L inthe fall.

The University brought the finalists to campus in two
groups of about 20, one last week and the other two

weeks ago.

“Toavoidany problems,”’ 12 female finalists stayed at
the McCampbell Inn on Main Street, according to Ross,
while the 28 men finalists stayed in the freshman dormi-

tories.

After the welcome, finalists were interviewed by one of
three panels of three faculty members.

Wednesday activities included attending three classes
and talking with professors and coaches

Members of the Student Recruitment Committee in-
terviewed finalists that night.

Before leaving the next day, the scholarship finalists
were interviewed by admissions officials.

Honor scholarships the University provides range
from stipends of $1,000 to full-tuition packages.

Some are based on need and region, such as the Keelty
scholarships, which are awarded to students from Balti-
more who demonstrate superior achievement in aca-
demics, extracurricular activities and service to others
but who would be financially unable to attend Washing-
ton and Lee without assistance,

An anonymous donation recently endowed a new full
tuition honor scholarship specifically for a woman.

The recipients of the awards will be determined on the

basis of the interviews by the faculty, students and ad-

missions officials, according to Ross.
“The purpose of the competition is not just a competi-
tion,”’ he said. ‘‘Most [finalists] have a very favorable

experience here on campus.”’

Comparing last year’s 120 applications for the Honor
Scholarships with this year’s 365, Ross said the ‘honing

down”’ process was much more difficult this year.

of last year’s.

He explained that — ‘‘top to bottom’’ — the applica-
tions were stronger this year. But he added that the best
of this group of finalists ‘‘easily’’ compares with the best

Man charged in hit and run

A 32-year-old Lexington man was
charged this weekend with hit and
run, driving under the influence of
alcohol and reckless driving in con-
nection with damages to three park-
ed cars, one owned by a Washington
and Lee law student.

Franklin D. Peters was charged
with hitting cars belonging to Rich
Whalen, a first-year law student, and
Wayne H. Nicely, a Lexington resi-
dent. A 1974 Dodge belonging to

Whalen and a 1973 Hornet and a 1973
Chevrolet, both belonging to Nicely,
were hit at about 11:40 p.m. Sunday,
Sutton said.

In other police action last week:

eA first-year law student was
charged Saturday night with destruc-
tion of private property for breaking
a beer stein at The Palms restaurant.
Glen Koontz, 23, ‘‘created a distur-
bance and was thrown out,’’ Sutton
said.

Sutton said that after officers ob-
tained a warrant and arrested
Koontz, the student was taken to the

police station, where he requested a
warrant charging the Palms man-
ager with assault. The magistrate
refused the request, Sutton said.

eBeverly Choonover of Roanoke
reported her purse stolen from her
car while it was parked in front of
Sigma Chi, where she was attending
a party, Sutton said. The purse was
left in the front seat of the car and
contained various credit cards and $8
incurrency.

eA steel barricade with blinking
lights worth $100 was stolen Friday
from the area of 203 Nelson St. Sutton
said there are nosuspects in the case.

Mollenhoff ‘on the record’ on the Gridiron

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Journalism Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff went to Washington last
weekend to eat, laugh and crack
jokes with other journalists, Su-
preme Court Justices, cabinet mem-
bers, congressmen and the president
of the United States.

And Mollenhoff, who writes for the
Washington Times, probably won't
even get a story out of it.

The occasion was the 100th an-
niversary of the Gridiron Club, a
group of 60 newspaper men and
women based in Washington. By tra-
dition, the members gather every
year for a white-tie dinner to lam-
poon world events and politicians.

In addition to dinner, the evening
includes skits, songs and speeches

designed to poke fun at those speak-
ing as well as at the opposition.

Mollenhoff has attended the func-
tion as a guest since 1952 and has
been a member since 1965. He is now
an associate member because he no

. longer lives inthe Washington area.

Entrance into the club is by nomi-
nation, and even then the nominee
might have to wait two or three years
to get in. Because there can be only
60 active members at a time, to geta
spot in the club, one must wait for a
member either to die or to become an
associate member.

The club has had only 400 members
since its inception in 1885, when it
was created for the enjoyment of all
the Washington bureau chiefs, Mol-
lenhoff said.

Only two rules are followed, ac-
cording to Mollenhoff. The first is
that no tasteless or sexy jokes are

allowed, and members are always

_ warned that ‘“‘women are present.”’

The second rule is that everything is
off the record. Some politicians, how-
ever, leak some of their better one-
liners tothe press.

Among the speakers this year, be-
sides President Reagan, were Geral-
dine Ferraro, representing the De-
mocrats, and Secretary of the Trea-
sury James Baker, representing the
Republicans.

Mollenhoff considers the Gridiron
dinner one of the highlights of the
year (ranking right up there with
Fancy Dress). ‘‘It’s the social occa-
sion of the year in Washington aside
from a White House invitation...and
it may even rank higher than that
with some people,’’ he said.

Members are invited to bring along
guests. One year, Mollenhoff took
columnist Jack Anderson, who had

never gone. Anderson somehow ‘for-
got the occasion was white tie and ap-
peared ina red plaid dinner jacket.

Mollenhoff also related a speech
once given by President Lyndon B.
Johnson at the dinner. As anyone who
has taken a course from Mollenhoff
knows, the Johnson administration,
and especially Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, did not care for
Mollenhoff.

A few days before the Gridiron din-
ner, a rather sharp exchange of
words occurred between Mollenhoff
and McNamara at a press confer-
ence. At the annual dinner, it was
noted that McNamara was not pre-
sent.

Johnson commented on this by say-
ing, ‘‘You’ve noticed Bob [McNa-
mara] isn’t here, he was a victim of a
‘Mollenhoff’ cocktail. So we sent him
to Geneva torecuperate.”’

Council delays action on new zone for dorm

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A zoning change that would allow
construction of a new Washington
and Lee dormitory was tabled Thurs-
day by the Lexington City Council.

The council said it wanted time for
further study of the proposal, which
has been called ‘‘quite suitable’’ by
University officials.

“‘T think we need time to study it,”
Councilman James E. Mays said.
‘‘T’ma little thick-headed. I’m a little
dense,”’ he added, telling the council
he was not clear on all points the ordi-
nance provided.

“I don’t quite understand the im-
pact of it,’’ said councilwoman and
W&L trade book manager Susan La-
Rue, who made the move to table the

ordinance.

W&L’s Frank A. Parsons, execu-
tive assistant to the president and the
school’s representative at the hear-
ing, said he is ‘surprised at how
much the council is in the dark at this
stage.”’

Mayor and W&L economics Profes-
sor Charles F. Phillips Jr. told Mays
that council members received an
original copy of the proposed zone at
least two weeks prior to the hearing.

The new “‘institutional zone’’ would
facilitate development of the W&L
campus, University officials say. The
new dormitory on West Nelson Street
is planned for use in the 1987-88
academic year.

Mays said his role as representa-
tive of Lexington businessmen caus-
ed him to question the adequacy of

the new plan. He said local mer-
chants are afraid the lack of student
parking resulting from a new dorm
would make it difficult for potential
customers to find adequate parking
in town.

“T don’t work for Washington and
Lee so I can say pretty much what i
feel like,” he said.

Councilman Thomas C. Imeson
said Mays’ comment suggested that
Imeson’s positions as a W&L chemis-
try professor and director of the com-
puter center placed him.ina ‘‘conflict
of interest.’’ He said he would there-
fore abstain from voting on the move
to table the ordinance.

LaRue asked if her job as trade
book manager in the University
Bookstore also placed her in a con-
flict of interest. Phillips said it did
not.

Phillips does not vote with council
unless necessary to break a tie.

The proposed site for the dorm is
now a W&L student parking lot. In

addition, the new dorm will bring 240
students to campus, according to
Parsons.

Parsons told the council that a re-
quirement of the district is to provide
parking spaces for half the number of
students the facility will house plus
an additional number for a percen-
tage of the square footage of the facil-
ity. “‘We thought that was a little
high,”’ he said.

He said the “‘reasonable interests”’
of the city regarding the parking is-
sue should not have caused Council to
table the ordinance. ‘‘These concerns
are to be addressed at a point down
the line,’ he said, referring to the
master plan that would have to be
passed by the Planning Commission
and City Council.

‘‘T think the plan that has been pro-
posed is quite suitable,’’ Parsons
said. He told the council the planned
site for the dormitory would place 240
students within walking distance of
downtown merchants.

Freshman
injured
in wreck

From Staff Reports

 

 

A Washington and Lee freshman
was listed in stable condition in
Roanoke Memorial Hospital this
week after he was injured Sunday in
a two-car wreck on U.S. 11.

The student, Arthur A. Hoffmann,
was driving a friend’s car north
toward Lexington about noon when
the car skidded across the road, hit
an embankment and overturned, ac-
cording to state police trooper Lane
McComas, who investigated the
wreck

The car, a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle,
then slid down the left side of the road
on its top before being hit by a 1981
Toyota driven by Sandrea Strick-
land, 21, of Hopewell, McComas said.

Hoffmann, 18, of Kinnelon, N.J.,
was found partially in and partially
out of the car’s rear window, which
had broken when the car turned over,
according to McComas. Hoffmann

Cox was arrested, Sutton said, be-
cause ‘‘he was the one that was most
out-front withhis mouth.”’

“He had the guts to shoot off his
mouth, but then he ran inside the
house in an apparent attempt to
escape,’’ he said. ‘‘The officers talk-
ed to the president and found [Cox]
hiding behind the door.”’

Sutton said that following the Cox
arrest, a group of about 30 students
gathered on the corner in front of Chi
Psi. ‘‘They continued to yell loud
obscenities and that type of conduct
and the officer called for assis-
tance,” he said.

Because of the group’s actions,
Joines ‘‘could have arrested
every one of them,’’ Sutton said.

A second city police car and two

rived, and the four vehicles blocked
the intersection of Lee and Nelson
streets. The knot of students dispers-

50-60 people were at the party when
Joines returned. ‘‘He said he wanted
everyone out of the house in five
minutes, ’’ Gatti recalled.

While he was ‘‘in the process of
emptying the house,’’ Gatti said
Joines located Cox. ‘‘The officer
grabbed the guy and took him out of
the house and arrested him,” he said.

Three students who said they wit-
nessed the Cox and Walker arrests
—freshman Marshall Boswell, junior
Bob Kelly and freshman Sully Re-
nuart — gave nearly identical ac-
counts of the sequence of events.

All three quoted Joines as saying to
Walker, ‘‘You’re under arrest for
assault.”’

“When he told the officer he was
from New York, the officer said, ‘It
figures,’ ’’ Boswell said.

The three said that Walker spoke to
the officer in response to a question
directed at the crowd, and that the of-
ficer had initiated the physical con-
tact. Kelley said the officer ‘‘jerked’’
Walker, and Boswell and Renuart
said he ‘‘grabbed”’ him.

Sutton said that ‘‘from the facts I
know now,”’ Joines, who has been a
policeman for about six years and
has been on the Lexington force for
just over a year, acted properly.

Sutton said that in order for an of-
ficer to enter a fraternity house, he
must have ‘‘probable cause to make
an arrest — reason to believe by any
of the five senses that a crime is be-
ing committed in his presence.”’

tion of public property.

The last charge was filed because
Smith broke out a police car window
ina struggle with police. He was sen-
tenced to 15 days in jail and fined
$380, including $200 for the car win-
dow.

The juvenile was later taken to
Stonewall Jackson Memorial Hospi-
tal by another officer to be treated
for injuries, according to an employ-
ee of the hospital who asked not to be
identified.

The source said Rice walked into
the emergency room of the hospital
and struck the handcuffed juvenile in
the face.

Richard L. Wiseman, a supervisor
for the Rockbridge Area Department
of Social Services, said his depart-
ment filed charges against Rice be-
cause it is the legal guardian of the
juvenile.

The case was tried in juvenile
court, according to Read, because
Virginia statutes require such treat-
ment whenever a juvenile is involved
as either a defendant ora victim.

135 condos to be built
on U.S. 60 near W&L

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s first condominium
community is ngw under construc-
tion, and the units being built are
targeted for members of the Wash-
ington and Lee community, accord-
ing to Richard Emrey of Baker Real
Estate and Insurance.

The project, Borden Commons,
consists of 135 units to be constructed
over the next five to 10 years. The
condominiums will be on a triangular
lot framed by Borden Road and US.
60 West, in the vicinity of Liberty
Hall and about a quarter-mile from
Washington and Lee, Emrey said.

The project is being developed by
the Duke Hathaway Corp. of Lexing-
ton, of which Emrey is a member.
The condos will be marketed by
Baker Real Estate of Lexington.

Emrey said he expects most of the
buyers to be from the college com-
munities — teachers, students and
other young professionals. ‘‘We think
that the project is one which the com-
munity needs and one which will ap-
peal to a large number of residents,”’
he said.

The first phase of construction will

include only 18 units; the rest will be
built later as the market is establish-
ed. The first units are scheduled to be
completed Aug. 15.

Emrey said Borden Commons bro-
chures are being mailed to parents of
W&L students. “We feel there is a
good market out there amongst the
students, whether it be students who
want to settle in Lexington or do
graduate work, and parents may be
interested in the units as an invest-
ment even if their children don’t stay
in them long,”’ he said.

The condominiums will be divided
into studio, one-bedroom and two
bedroom units. Studio units are pric-
ed at $29,500, one-bedroom units at
$39,500 and the two-bedroom units
from $57,500 to $62,500. All units in-
clude wooden balconies, fully-equip-
ped kitchens and wall-to-wall carpet-
ing. Fireplaces are available upon
request and are standard in the two-
bedroom units.

The buildings will be three stories
high and will be earth-tone stucco on
the outside.

The project has met some resis-
tance from the city, Emrey said, be-
cause of the complexities of pro-
viding the project with water and
sewer hookups.

Student scraps magazine plan
after EC denies funds request

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

After the Executive Committe de-
nied him funds Monday night, sopho-
more Anthony Cornealius said he has
decided not to publish a literary
Magazine containing works by stu-
dents at W&L and at area colleges.

Hesitation on the part of other
schools to participate and the fact
that ‘‘I couldn’t buy any more time’”’
led to his decision, Cornealius said.

Cornealius’ request was denied by
a 5-4-1 vote. His request had gone up
from $400 two weeks ago to $800 on
Monday.

“IT am really disappointed in the
EC,” hesaid, ‘‘but not bitter.’’

Cornealius plans to appeal to the
EC again next fall. ‘‘The money will
be harder to procure in the fall be-
cause so many other parties will be
doing the same thing,” he said.

a Chief puts Phi Kap.
on ‘social probation’:

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
met with Phi Kappa Sigma last night
and imposed what he called ‘‘a form
of social probation’’ because he said
relations between the fraternity and
police had reached ‘‘an intolerable
point.”’

After the 15-minute, all-house
meeting, Sutton declared a two-week
moratorium on that house’s acquisi-
tion of amplified sound or so-called
“noise’’ permits. The March 29
through April 8 probation period in-
cludes winter examination week,
during which University regulations
prohibit parties.

“This is the first time that this has
been done with a specific fraternity,’
said Sutton, who added that he warn-
ed Phi Kap that continued trouble
could result in future denials of per-
mits.

Problems with the fraternity have
included ‘unnecessary rowdiness
and danger of personal injury for
their guests and my officers when-
ever they have to go there,’’ Sutton
said.

Phi Kap President Jim Cobb called
the restrictions ‘‘fair,”’ but disputed a
number of Sutton’s charges, saying
the police chief’s version of the in-
cidents ‘‘is not always exactly what
happened.”

Sutton explained that Phi Kap’s

Rangers capture first

difficulties with the police “have

eae?

~
+

been more consistent” than those of *
any other fraternity. ‘‘It has gotten” |

out of the nuisance stage into the ser- ~

ious stage,” he said. *

“The members of that house have
been creating problems such as
throwing glass bottles in the street
and sidewalk, throwing beer kegs, .
glass bottles and fireworks in the
vicinity of policemen,’’ Sutton con-
tinued.

He pointed out that although there
have been problems for some time, a
party held Saturday was particularly
troublesome. ‘‘My officers had to be -
there six or seven times on different
occasions between midnight Satur-
day and3 a.m. Sunday,” hesaid.

Cobb explained that many of the in-
cidents such as bottle and firework
throwing did not happen as Sutton .
explained them and that the throwing
of the beer keg was ‘‘by no means at
a police officer.”’

‘We realize that there was a pro-
blem Saturday night,” Cobb said.
“The problem stemmed from there
being too many unaccounted for peo-
ple inthe house.”

He said one way the fraternity
hopes to prevent future problems is
by closing its parties to non-mem-
bers.

can to prevent the problems in the

in Virginia challenge

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

A squad of W&L Army ROTC
cadets from the ROTC Ranger Com-
pany captured first place in the
Ranger Challenge ’85 held last week-
end in Williamsburg.

The squad of seven cadets came in
first out of 12 squads from seven dif-
ferent schools. The other schools
were James Madison University,
Hampton Institute, William and
Mary, Virginia State, Norfolk State
and Christopher Newport.

“‘T expected them to perform well,”’
said Ranger adviser Capt. Robert R.
Ripple, “but I was surprised to see
them do this well.’’

The Ranger Challenge, the first of
its kind, was made up of nine differ-
ent events. The Ranger squad placed
first in the log race, the M16 assem-
bly/disassembly relay, the leader-
ship reaction station and the land
navigation course. The other events
were a tug of war, a rope bridge race,
a military tactics competition, a

drill-and-ceremonies competition
and a 10-kilometer road
march.

Cadet ist Lt. Arthur Kandarian,
the platoon leader of the Ranger
company, said the cadets spent a
couple of hours every day for two
weeks training and preparing for the
event.

Kandarian attributed the success
of the Ranger company to the train-
ing provided by Capt. Ripple and ©
Ranger NCO adviser Sgt. ist Class .
Raymon L. Kuper as well as ‘‘except-
ional leadership”’ on the part of Cadet
Capt. Mark Bertolini, the Ranger .
Company Commander.

A second squad of cadets alsocom- . |

peted in the challenge and placed .
fifth overall. The first squad was led .
by Bertolini, and the other members ~
were Kandarian, Tony Pfaff, An- ”

thony McCann, Steve Vogt, John * *-

Loughery and Jim Worthington.

The second squad was led by Sam '
Dawson, and the other members '
were Chris Honeycutt, Mark Solo- ’
mon, Noor Ampssler, Chris Beckert,
Rich Bennett and Bill Samii.

“That kind of night won't happen =
again,” Cobb added. ‘‘I’ll do all that I

Two local stores, Campus Corner
and Lexington Dry Goods, were re-
cently sold and are temporarily clos-
ed for remodeling.

The stores were purchased by Russ
Walther Jr.

Campus Corner, which will be re-
named The Campus Shop, should
open Monday for regular business,
and Lexington Dry Goods, which will
be renamed Russel’s, should open by
mid-April.

The Campus Shop, on Nelson Street
between Jefferson Street and Lee
Avenue, will be open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. and will stock an expanded se-
lection of records and tapes, ranging

from $5.99 to $6.99.
The shop also will carry stereo .
equipment, including compact disc -

players and discs, and at least a li-~ *

mited line of computer software.

The shop will have about 10 out-of-
town newspapers, including The New
York Times and The Wall Street.
Journal, an expanded selection of -
magazines and fresh coffee and pas-
tries each morning, according to Rita
Mason, the store’s manager. ‘‘Right
now we're just trying to experi-
ment,’’ she said, but other possible
projects for the future may include
renting stereo and television equip-
ment so that students won’t have to
bring their entire stereo systems
from home.

When Russel’s opens it will carry
clothes for both men and women, and
will emphasize moderately priced
clothes lines.

The rivalry between Washington
and Lee and the University of Virgin-
+ ia in lacrosse made this year’s con-
frontation seem somewhat like a
state championship. When the Cav-
+ aliers walked off the field with the up-
per hand of the 17-7 score, they left
Lexington with bragging rights to the
* Commonwealth.

The Generals’ record, meanwhile,
now stands at 1-3, having lost their
® last three games to Atlantic Coast
Conference powerhouses University
of North Carolina, University of
© Maryland and U.Va. During the first
period, though, it looked as though
the Generals were going to place the
Cavaliers inthe wincolumn.

‘‘We played extremely well in the
first half and I must say that we real-
ly didn’t play badly all day, despite
the score. We played with a lot of in-
tensity,’ said Coach Dennis Daly.

With 8:51 left in the first period,
senior attackman Rod Santomassi-
mo made his mark on the minds of
the U.Va. players — he scored, and
the Generals led 1-0. But the celebra-
, tion did not last long, because 40 sec-

onds later, U.Va.’s Mike Myers re-
turned the favor and tied the game up
at 1-1. At that point, the 3,000 people
in the stands each looked at their
friends and must have realized that it
was going tobea long day.

But 20 seconds passed and senior
Sandy Brown, the Generals’ leading
scorer with seven goals, regained the
lead for W&L. The scoreboard had
only indicated the score of 2-1 for a
minute and 35 seconds before junior
Todd Breithaupt introduced himself
to the Cavaliers’ defense with a very
* personal touch — a shot and goal.
The crowd exploded. The first period
ended with the Generals leading 3-1.
* ‘“W&L came out aggressively, and
it woke us up,”’ Virginia head coach
Jim Adams said. ‘‘It took a quarter
" for us torealize we were ina battle.”’
, That battle continued throughout

the second period. After 3:08 of the
* period, the Generals’ lead was cut to
» One goal, and a short 23 seconds later,
the game was tied at three.

The 3-3 tie was then broken by jun-
ior attackman Caulley Deringer, and
the Generals led again, 4-3. The
‘ Generals then held the Cavaliers, not
allowing them to clear the ball for
nearly seven minutes. But with 3:37
left in the half, Virginia put its
scholarships to work — they tied the
gameat four.

The Ring-tum Phi

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

W&L’s Rod Santomassimo and U.Va.’s Bob Schupler battle for a ground ball in Saturday's lacrosse game.

Rich ‘‘Taz’’ Schoenberg won the
ensuing face-off, though, and worked
the ball to Bill Holmes, whose shot
from 15 feet hit Breithaupt’s foot and-
fell short of the goal. Breithaupt tried
to put in the rebound but missed, and
the Cavaliers regained possession of
the ball. They quickly moved down
the field and scored for their first
lead of the day, 5-4. Before halftime,
the Cavaliers would add another goal
tomake the score 6-4.

“The lead change didn’t really af-
fect us that much during half,”
Breithaupt said. ‘‘Everyone was
pumped up and ready toplay.”’

But within 3:08 of the third period,
U.Va.’s all-American Roddy Marino
dimmed the lights on Wilson Field as
he scored two goals to make Virgin-
ia’s lead 8-4.

The Generals refused to give in,
though, and came back with goals
from Holmes and Deringer to make
the score 8-6. But it was the Cava-

big match was at No. 1 singles with
David McLeod’s impressive win over
Newport’s previously undefeated Bill
O'Donnel. McLeod, playing tough
tennis, won in three sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.

Although the Generals again won
by an 8-1 margin, Tuesday’s match
against Lynchburg College was a
great deal oloser, with four matches
going to three sets.

In the match, Adams ran his un-
beaten string to 10 for the season.
“Scott Adams continues on his roll of
dominance at No. 6,” Franke said.

The Generals again missed a shut-
out by one match, a result, against
Lynchburg, of a strong No. 1 singles
player catching McLeod on a ‘bad
day,”’ rendering him ineffective in a
6-1, 6-2 match.

The Generals’ lineup underwent
another change this week when Mize
and Adams moved up from No. 3 to
No, 2 doubles and Haring and Wiman
down to No. 3. Of last week’s altera-
tion in singles, Franke said he was
pleased and indicated that, for the
foreseeable future, the players would
remain in their current positions.

Today the Generals have a home
match against Hampden-Sydney.

liers’ ninth goal that made heads sink
to the ground — senior goalie John
DiDuro blocked a shot, the ball fell to
the ground and was kicked in. Daly
referred to that goal as ‘‘a tough
goal, the type of goal we need to get,
not teams like U.Va.”’

The rest of the game was sheer
dominance by U.Va., which out-
scored the Generals 8-1.

The man who deserves praise is Di-
Duro’ He was like a piece of plexi-
glass in front of the goal during the
first half. He stopped shots that made
U.Va. players look twice and say, ‘‘I
thought I scored.’’ DiDuro (18 saves )
was the first goalie to stand up to
U.Va. and create a problem. For
that, DiDuro was named player of
the game, along with Holmes.

“We've been up and down offen-
sively and defensively,’’ said Vir-
ginia’s Marino, ‘‘but I thought today

Or perhaps he means they couldn’t
get by DiDuro and the spectacular
defense that just wouldn’t let up.

“Against Towson, we need to be
physical. I’’m worried the team will
be uptight. But if we play like we can
play we will win and be the best we
canbe,” Daly said.

This week, the Generals will play
at Towson State, which lost to UNC
26-5 last week. The Generals are
most likely favored in this contest
and should be able to dominate the
game.

W&L assistant coach Sam Carpen-
ter summed up the Generals’ pro-
gress as this: “If I was the assistant
at Towson and scouted W&L Satur-
day against U.Va., I would be very
concerned. W&L is not to be taken
lightly.”’

“T think and billie that if we con-
iinue to improve game by game we
could go 8-3,’’ Carpenter said.

Stanford, a junior co-captain of
the team, finished seventh in the
200-yard butterfly and eighth in
the 100-yard butterfly to claim A-
A honors, while Sullivan, a fresh-
man, ended up in 16th place in the
500-yard freestyle event.

As a team; W&L sent seven
swimmers to the Championships
and finished the weekend in 25th
place in a field of over 90 teams.

ATLANTA — ....(Even a dateline

can’t stop the dots. ) They had the
NCAA Division II] Swimming and
Diving Championships here, but I
will take more from here than times
and swimmers and lots of water. Be-
cause of the extraordinary talents of
one young man and his means of
dealing with that talent, I was able
to witness a certain strength of character, unassuming yet confi-

dent, that we look for in the true champion.

I’m talking about a junior swimmer from Ohio's Kenyon College.
His name is Jim Born. So far, this probably means all of nothing to
you. The point is that last weekend, Born — Division III swimming’s
equivalent to the NHL’s Wayne Gretzky — won or was part of winning
seven events. But the real reason for commendation is that Born was
expected to do that well. It is the ability to respond to such pressure, to
see what people expect, and then to go four or five steps beyond those
expectations that demands attention.

What is interesting about Division III is that you are clouded by the
thinking that these athletes were not good enough to get Division I
scholarships, hence their ability level dims by comparison. That’s
simply not the case with Born, who qualified for the Olympic trials last

year,

To look at him, you wouldn’t know this was a swimmer, let alone a
championship swimmer. He’s probably all of 5-fuot-9 and probably in
the neighborhood of 165 pounds soaking wet. Indeed, not your Steve
Lundquist type. But then you look again and you see something — yes,

it might sound trite, that is, if it weren’t true —

word ‘go,’ this guy’s a winner.

in his eyes. From the

Watching Born swim was a unique experience. Even if you weren’t
interested in the sport, he’s the kind of performer that you just sit and
watch in awe. No yawns, no paging through the program to see what
the next event is or what kind of films the NCAA is offering. It’s the
kind of performance for which instant replay is made.

Picture this, Born set records (that’s as in more than one) in the 50-
freestyle (swimming’s 100-yard dash) both in the morning’s
preliminary and the evening’s final heat. The record going into the
championships was 20.76. A couple of hours later Born had cut the
mark to 19.97. The feat warranted a standing ovation, and got one.

It was in the end a pleasure to be able to watch a top athlete like Jim
Born perform. I wonder how often this superiority in action is present
in our world of repeating the big story and ignoring the little story.
Well, this piece has been an example of just how big those little stories

can be....

*ke

....Back home again at the Colonnade, and I heur the lacrossers gave
U.Va. fits for almost a half. I’m going to say that’s a good sign’ but I’m
sure there’s a contingent who are wondering when W&L is going to
stop banging its head against a wall...While we’re on swimming, a tip
of the cap to those W&L swimmers who earned All-America status:
Tim Stanford and Eric Sullivan (Just in case the stuffed shirt intellec-
tuals were wondering, the hard work and long hours did pay off.)....

... Something tells me the Big East breeds the best basketball this
year. Good to see all the ‘‘Black Sunday”’ ACC stories after the in-
famous weekend devastation. And some say the Big East has nothing
near the parity level that the ACC has. Ask Georgetown about the fits
it got from UConn early this year or the time Seton Hall led St. John’s
by 12in a January game....Word to wise, while we’re on the subject:
UNC will blow a lot of people’s doors off next year. Watch out for a
freshman named Jeff Lebo, kind of a Kyle Macy with quickness, mus-

cle and scoring punch...

...1’m going to put my neck on the line — as if it is any great
sacrifice — and say that Georgetown will not win the national
championship and that they will be beaten by a Big East team. It does
have some options open, none of which are fathomable....

...Finally, the Mickey Mouse Times and Donald Duck Review says
that Chris Mullin and Pat Ewing won’t be able to wear their T-shirts in
the NBA next year. Some sort of rule about uniform uniforms.
Granted, that is a piece of startiing information (something the
MacNeil-Lehrer Report just won’t touch), but for as much as these
guys are going to be making, I don’t think they’ll mind making such a

concession...

 

 

Silent bats have ‘nine’ mired in slump

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington Lee baseball
team, plagued by hitting and injury
problems, dropped its sixth and
seventh consecutive games this
week, losing to Hampden-Sydney,
13-4, and Lynchburg, 8-4.

The losses lowered the Generals’
record to 2-7 overall and 0-4 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.

The Generals’ woes go beyond the
losses, though.

The team’s hottest hitter at the
start of the season, Hugh Finkelstein,
underwent arthroscopic knee sur-
gery yesterday. He is expected to be
out for at least two weeks. In addi-
tion, starting catcher Mike Jacoby
has been forced out of his catching
duties with an injury to his throwing
hand.

Leslie gets win 100;
linksters go to 4-0

Washington and Lee golf coach
Buck Leslie won his 100th match
Monday when the Generals defeated

Bridgewater and Shepherd to bring, - -

their record to 4-0.

“I was more interested in winning
the match Monday, but it is very nice
to reach that 100-win -milestone,’’
said Leslie, who has led W&L to three
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
championships.

Freshman Gary Campbell led the
Generals with a low round of 77 on the
par-71 Lexington Country Club
course.

Last Thursday, W&L beat Liberty
Baptist and Longwood to post their
first two victories of the season. The
team scores were W&L 322, Liberty
Baptist 332 and Longwood 338

W&L’s next outing is Friday in
Lynchburg against Liberty Baptist

Despite his team’s difficulties,
head coach Jim Murdock maintains
that the Generals have the ability to
beamong the ODAC’s best.

“It’s really frustrating,’’ Murdock
said. ‘‘We’re capable of being a good
team but we're starting to doubt our-
selves. We’re just getting to the part
of the season where our people are
getting their baseball sense back,
even though it has taken too long.”’

Against Lynchburg yesterday, the
Generals were hurt by one big inning.
WA&L trailed only 2-1 entering the
eighth inning before giving up four
unearned runs to the Hornets.

Lynchburg scored four runs on an
error, two walks and three hits, mak-
ing the score 6-1. Lynchburg added
two more runs in the ninth off W&L
reliever Peter Detlefs to up its lead to
8-1.

The Generals could muster only
three hits against Lynchburg starter
Judd Petrone. Breen pitched 7%, giv-
ing up four earned runs on six hits
before being relieved by Detlefs.

‘We hit the ball pretty well, but
just right at somebody,” Murdock
said after the Lynchburg loss. ‘‘We
played pretty well defensively. We’re
still putting too much pressure on
ourselves, We were hurt by our old
nemesis, the one bad inning.”’

“In the eighth, Kirk was getting a
little tired, and we couldn’t get him
out in time,’’ Murdock said.

Last Thursday, W&L fell to Hamp-
den-Sydney, 13-4, in a game that had
the makings of a low scoring contest
through the first three innings when
neither team could score. The
Generals had the bases loaded in
both the second and third innings

with no outs and one out, respective-
ly, but were unable to get the crucial
hit toscorea run.

In the fifth, W&L took a 2-0 lead on-
ly to see the Tigers post four runs in
their half of the inning. H-SC added
five more runs in the sixth, making
the score 9-2, holding on the rest of
the way for the win.

Bill Schoettelkotte got the loss for
W&L after starting strongly before
fading in the fifth and sixth innings.
Freshman Carter Steuart pitched 2',
innings in relief for Schoettelkotte.

W&L gets its next chance to get
back in the victory column tomorrow
against crosstown rival VMI. The
Generals face Emory and Henry Sat-
urday in an away doubleheader and
host Eastern Mennonite and H-SC in
astretch of ODAC games next week.

T&F runs streak to 13

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Winning seven of the 16 events, the
Washington and Lee track team won
a four-way meet that also included
Newport News Apprentice, Roanoke
and Eastern-Mennonite at Wilson
Field on Tuesday.

The Generals scored 871% points en
route to their victory. Newport News
took second with 63 points. Roanoke
and Eastern Mennonite finished third
and fourth, scoring 22 and 101% points
respectively.

The Generals are now 6-0 overall
and 4-0 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

The injury-plagued Generals suf-
fered another casualty on Tuesday
when sophomore John Burlingame
pulled his hamstring while running
the third leg of the 400 meter relay.
The Generals currently have three

people on the injury list, all with pull-
ed hamstring, including Burlingame.
Kevin Weaver and Bill Rhinehart
both have severe pulls also. John
Carder is nursing a sore hamstring.

Head track coach Norris Aldridge
said it is very unusual to have that
many pulled hamstrings on the team
at the same time. ‘‘It’s hurting our
depth a little bit,”’ said Aldridge. He
added, however, ‘‘We can’t really do
anything about it.’ Aldridge hopes
that the injured team members are
100 percent when the Generals par-
ticipate in the OAC outdoor cham-
pionships.

The Generals have now completed
their outdoor dual meet schedule for
this season. The 1985 record of six
wins and no losses combined with
last year’s record of 7-0 gives the
Generals a 13-meet victory streak.
The win streak is Coach Aldridge’s
longest during his career as W&L's
head track coach.

thesis

By BOB BRYANT
Special to The Phi

 

 

Chris Liflja is busy working on his
senior thesis. But instead of studying
by himself insome remote corner, he
is standing in the middle of a room
full of people.

Dressed in elaborate 17th-century
costumes, they listen to him as in-
tently as a team listens to their coach
before a game. Lillja is dressed in
jeans and sweater and holds a yellow
tablet covered with notes. ‘‘How are
you going to show an infuriated
monk?” he asks one of the actors.
“I’ve never seen a monk raise his
voice.”

Lillja is a drama major. His senior
thesis is a production of Bertold
Brecht's ‘‘Galileo,’’ which will open.
at 8 p.m. tomorrow at the Troubador
Theatre. He has been working on the
play for almost a year because, like
any other senior thesis, ‘‘the entire
department analyzes and evaluates
the project.’ He will enter the
graduate school at Virginia Com-
monwealth University this fall.

Last year Lillja directed ‘‘The In-
former,’ a one-act play by Brecht
that deals with the impact of the
Gestapo on German family life.

“Brecht invented plays specifical-
ly designed to be not naturalistic
dramas, but a learning experience

The University Theatre will present Berthold Brecht's “Galileo” beginning tomorrow night.

for the audience. That's my favorite
thing about Brecht,”’ Lilljasaid.

“Theater is the most effective
teaching tool we have," he added. He
calls ‘‘Galileo’’ a ‘‘learning play,”’
because its message ‘‘needs to be
said.”’ He said he is ‘‘updating’’ this
production by ‘relating it to the
modern military-industrial complex
and atomic weapons. ”’

Lillja said Brecht ‘‘is telling us that
science needs to be directed by the
forces of humanity, not by the forces
of profits and greed. This must of
course begin with the scientists
themselves. ”’

Galileo himself is played by Mark
Daughtrey, who graduated from
W&L in 1974 and has studied at the
American Academy of Fine Art.

“Mark is wonderful to work with,”’
Lillja said. “He has amazing
amounts of talent.’’ Daughtrey star-
red as Thomas More in the Universi-
ty Theatre’s production of ‘‘A Man
for All Seasons”’ in the fall of 1982.

In the dressing room, Lillja asks
another actor, ‘‘How are you going to
show the little kids in the audience
the difference between Sacredo and
the philosopher?’’ The actor, like
many others in the company, is hav-
ing to play two separate roles and
make quick costume changes several
times in the course of the evening.

“It’s common procedure in Brecht
to double up roles,"’ Lillja said. “‘It’s
difficult, but I'm very pleased with
the cast I have.” The play contains 41
different speaking roles, ‘and when

there are only about 10 drama ma-
jors, we have toadapt.”’

The first step a director must take
is to place himself ‘‘in the position of
the actor in each different role,’’ Lill-
ja said. ‘‘You’ve got to understand
both acting and directing, even
though you don’t have to be talented
at one todo the other.”

Minutes after Lillja leaves the
dressing room, he is down in the

theater, pacing side-to-side in an ai-

sle as the technical crew runs
through the special effects supplied
by NASA and the U.S. Army. His face
breaks intoa wide grin.

‘I won’t get a chance to do this big
a production for a long time,’’ Lillja
said. ‘‘Even in graduate programs at
big state schools, they’re doing most-
ly one-acts.”’

Student directors present
three ‘bad’ one-act plays

“An Evening of Bad One-Acts,”’
three one-act plays, will be perform-
ed next Wednesday and Thursday in
the Boiler Room _ Theatre,
underneath the Old Main Street Mall.

Are the plays as bad as advertised?

No, says the director of one of the
plays, senior Todd Jones,

“However, it makes a great adver-
tising gimmick,’’ he said. ‘‘We’re
hoping to bring people in by daring
them to see just how bad these plays
are, and the general idea is that
they’ll be pleasantly surprised.”

Curtain time is 7:30 p.m. for both
showings. Admission is free, and
reservations are not required.

The first one-act, ‘‘The Zoo Story”’
by Edward Albee, is directed by jun-
ior Christopher Carmouche. The cast
consists of only two characters:
middle-aged men named Jerry and
Peter, portrayed by seniors Taylor

Hathaway and Bob Halloran, respec-
tively.

‘Bea, Frank, Ritchie and Jones,”’
a 1960s comedy written by Renee
Taylor and Joe Bolognia, will be the
second production. It is directed by
junior David Marsh.

“Black Comedy,” by Peter Shaf-
fer, is the final production and will be
directed by Jones with junior Bruin
Richardson serving as stage man-

ager.

German film set

The Film Society will present Wer-
ner Herzog’s 1982 epic of obsession,
‘“‘Fitzearroldo,’’ tomorrow and Satur-
day.

Screenings will be at 8 p.m. both
evenings in Classroom A of Lewis
Hall. Admission is free.

‘Splatter film’ saga
lives — unfortunately

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

Surprise of surprises! ‘‘Friday the
13th, The Final Chapter’ wasn’t the
final chapter after all. Now playing
at the Lyric is the latest horror/hack
‘em up, “Friday the 13th, Part 5, A
New Beginning.” Jason Voorhees
(or is it Jason Voorhees?) is back to
terrorize, cut and kill. Surprisingly,
“Friday 5’’ attempts to be a psycho-
logical film with substance to it, but
it reverts to the use of typical horror-
movie cliches and leaves its cutting
edge as a breakthrough ‘‘slasher”’
picture.

Young Tommy, who killed Jason in
“Final Chapter,’ is now a young
adult in a mental institution, a result
of the trauma caused by his exper-
ience with Jason. He is brought to a
special rehabilitation facility to
prepare him for reentering society,
but bursts of violent temper and fre-
quent ‘‘sightings’” of Jason key the
audience to realize he isn’t quite
ready for society. Then, a violent
murder at the institution sets off a
string of more murders, and we are
propelled into Jason’s realm again.

Like every ‘‘slasher,”’ “Friday 5”
is loaded with gruesome killings,
some seen, others known only by see-
ing the dead victims. Taken lightly, —
these bizarre murders form the unbe-
lievable backdrop to a joke of a
movie. Taken seriously, one wonders °
why such pictures are made, and
worse, why they are big box office
dreaws. :

Credit can be given to the idea of
making ‘Friday 5’’ a bit of a my-
stery: I felt for Tommy as he strug-
gled to forget the spectre of Jason, .
and for a few minutes, I actually _
wondered if he was the new Jason.
Then, after a moment of semi-ap-
plied thinking, I realized who the
killer was, and the rest of the movie
went quickly downhill. The ending, of »
course, is a head spinner that sets up
still more sequels.

Andisn’t that the name of the game
anyway? We seem doomed to a fate _
of sequels year in and year out. ‘“‘Fri-
day the 13th, Part 5, A New Begin »
ning” is not so new at all; it is a for-
mula ‘‘slasher’’ movie, and we can
expect more sequels to result. Some-
day the chant ‘‘Jason, Jason, Jason, ,
Jason...kill, kill, kill, kill....”’ may
end, but sadly, I doubtit. :
