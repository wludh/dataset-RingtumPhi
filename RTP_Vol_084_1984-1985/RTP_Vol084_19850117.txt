From Staff Reports

 

eA fraternity has its pledges play ‘‘kill the
keg.”

¢Another house ‘‘invites”’ its freshmen to act
as waiters at lunch and dinner.

*Still other pledges are sent on a scavenger
hunt to collect ‘‘harmless’’ items such as
license plates, McDonald’s flags and Wendy’s
suggestion boxes.

To many fraternity members, this is part of
what pledge education is all about: achieving
that elusive ‘‘pledge unity’ that every house
seeks.

Some administrators, though, take a dim
view of such activity. The feeling seems to be
that pledge education should consist largely of

studying the history of the fraternity and car-
rying out community service projects.

Head dormitory counselor Bob Tomaso said
the fine line between hazing and education is
sometimes crossed, but that ‘‘it’s getting bet-
ter every year.”

“Every fraternity hazes, to a certain ex-
tent,’’ he said. “I’m sure there are a lot of
things that the Hill doesn’t find out about. But
some things that happen are just individuals
getting out of hand, rather than houses getting
out of hand.”

Tomaso said dormitory counselors attempt
to keep on top of any rule violations by frater-
nities, although not with total success. ‘‘To ig-
nore the problem is just ridiculous,’’ he said.
‘*We do the best we can.”

University records show that 16 of the 27 dor-

mitory counselors are or have been members
of fraternities.

Interfraternity Council President David
Perdue said that although hazing has been
“‘drastically reduced’’ since his freshman
year, it will take a few more years ‘‘to get it to
where it is entirely non-existent.”’

He added that he’s certain ‘‘nothing goes on
at Washington and Lee that really qualifies as
dangerous hazing.”’

Each person has his own definition of haz-
ing, he said, but one way to look at it would be
a “physically or mentally or psychologically
traumatic experience that a pledge would not
want to dobut could be forced to do.”’

As examples, he cited forced drinking and
making a pledge sit on a block of ice until he
tells a joke that’s suitably funny.

Perdue said that ‘‘dumping” a pledge in
some remote location is ‘‘a kind of joke and
everybody goes along with it.’’ He said it’s not
so bad ‘‘as long as somebody keeps an eye on
what’s going on.”

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of students
for fraternity affairs, said he relies primarily
on the dorm counselors for notification of any
abuse of freshmen by the fraternities.

“This year I can’t recall any hazing action
being reported by any of the dorm counse-
lors,”’ he said. ‘‘I’d like to think that we know
of all the incidents, but I’m not sure that we do.
I think perhaps a lot of it has been driven
underground.

John Haywood, president of Kappa Sigma,
says that although many may close their eyes

School will
honor Lee

on Monday

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

 

The induction of 28 Washington and
Lee students into the Omicron Delta
Kappa leadership fraternity and a
speech by former W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley will highlight
the activities at the 114th annual
Founders’ Day Convocation on Mon-
day.

The convocation will begin at 12:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel. Following Hunt-
ley’s speech, titled “The Way We
Were,”’ 16 seniors, six juniors and six
law students will be inducted into
ODK, a _ national honor society
recognizing outstanding leadership
that was founded at Washington and
Lee.

Founders’ Day at W&L is held an-
nually on or around the Jan. 19 birth-
day of Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was
president of the University from 1865
until his death in 1870.

Poor attendance at last year’s
Founders’ Day sparked criticism by
faculty and administrators of student
apathy and lack of regard for Univer-
sity traditions.

Bite your tongue

  

By Andy Beck/The Ring-tum Phi

In response, Read’s lawyer
cites ‘substantial falsehoods’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

A report by a committee of the
Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar
Association contains a series of
allegations about Commonwealth’s
Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’? Read
that the committee says “if true,
reflect seriously on the professional
fitness of Mr. Read.”’

Read, the prosecutor for Lexington
and Rockbridge County, declined
comment on the report. His lawyer
said that ‘‘as constituted, it contains
substantial falsehoods.”

The information is contained in an
eight-page report of a committee
formed earlier this year to invest-
igate ‘‘the administration of justice
in Rockbridge County.”

‘‘Although the committee received
comments concerning the adminis-
tration of justice, by far the most
numerous and serious concerns re-
lated to the conduct” of Read, the
report states.

“If the information received by the
committee is false, Mr. Read de-
serves to be exonerated,”’ it contin-
ues. “If the information is true, his
professional fitness as an attorney
must be seriously questioned.”’

The committee said its findings fell
into three main categories: ‘‘unwant-
ed and uninvited sexual advances
and assaults directed at female
clients; betrayal of client con-
fidences; and prosecutorial miscon-
duct connected with the recently ad-
journed Special Grand Jury of the
Rockbridge County Circuit Court”
that investigated local drug traffick-
ing.

a the committee’s recommenda-
tion, then-president of the bar assoc-
iation J. Todd Jones forwarded the
report to the Virginia State Bar late
last year.

‘T unuerstanu an investigation is

underway,” Jones said.

Bar investigators Harry M. Hirsch
and Robert W. Kin of Richmond both
declined comment on reports that
they were in Lexington on Dec. 27 to
investigate the report's allegations.

Read is being represented in the
case by Joseph M. Spivey III of the
Richmond law firm of Hunton & Wil-
liams, where Read was an associate
from 1971-74.

In a statement, Spivey commented
on the report. ‘‘As constituted, it con-
tains substantial falsehoods,’’ he
said.

He declined to clarify the meaning
of the qualification ‘‘as constituted.”

“The report of the so-called Admin-
istration of Justice committee,
which, significantly, is not under
oath, is fraught with speculation and
innuendo and supported by state-
ments of anonymous persons, con-
victed felons and political opponents
of John Read,’’ the statement con-
tinued.

‘Read will be vindicated once his
accusers are required to testify and
be cross-examined under oath.”’

Spivey said he has asked the state
bar to investigate how reporters ob-
tained copies of the document

The report is accompanied by an

appendix of more than 37 pages that
purports to document the claims in
the report,

Jones said he discussed the com-
mittee’s findings with every member
of the local bar and informed them of
the report's contents before forward-
ing it to the state bar. He said he gave
Read a copy of the document Nov. 26

“In lieu of holding a general meet
ing, which I thought would have fo-
cused undue publicity on something
that should have been handled dis
creetly, I consulted each member in
dividually,’’ Jones said

After eight months of work, the
committee submitted the report to
Jones in mid-November

Drinking age of 21
could shut Cockpit

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A drinking age of 21 in Virginia
could bring about the failure of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Cockpit and prevent
the sale of beer at social events in the
pavilion, according to University of-
ficials.

And Dean of Students Lewis G.
John believes passage of such a law
is “‘almost certain” because of Con-
gress’ passage of law denying federal
highway funds to states that do not
have a drinking age of 21 by Oct. 1,
1986.

The Virginia General Assembly
will definitely consider raising the
drinking age, now 19 for beer, during
week, John
said.

“It is no longer a question of wheth-
er it will be implemented,” he added,
“but primarily a question of how it
will be implemented. ..and when.”’

“T don’t think there is any doubt’’
that a law raising the drinking age to
21 will be passed, said an aide to Del.
Vance Wilkins, a Republican who re-
presents Lexington and Rockbridge
County.

“The general feeling is that it will

Spectators at Saturday’s pavilion
concert must be on their best behav-
ior or they may no longer be able to
drink or purchase beer in the
pavilion, according to Associate
Dean of Students Mike Cappeto.

Alcoholic Beverage Control Board
agents will be ‘‘keeping their eye’’ on
the happenings in the pavilion, said
Cappeto, adding that ABC agents
were concerned about the number of
violations at the last pavilion con-
cert, in December.

Cappeto said that the ABC will be
looking for a ‘‘good, honest” effort by
the Student Activities Board to en-
force the rules.

“If there are several instances of
violations,’ Cappeto said, ‘‘they will
close the pavilion to beer like they did
Zoliman’s Pavilion.”’

If the ABC revokes the pavilion’s li-
quor license, Cappeto said, it proba-
bly would not be returned for the re-
mainder of the year.

The bar’s report: what it says

The ‘‘findings of the committee” section of the report
is divided into three parts:

v Sexual advances and assaults. “For a number of
years, rumors have circulated in the area alleging sex-
ual misconduct by Mr. Read directed toward his
clients,’ the report states. “The committee received
documents substantiating and lending credence to
these rumors.”

Among those documents, which are included in the
report’s appendix, are affidavits from two former
female clients and three letters from the local legal aid
society that allege such behavior by Read.

» Betrayal of client confidences and failure to protect
and promote the best interests of his clients. ‘‘Allegations
have been made in a pending criminal prosecution that
Mr. Read has used information obtained from private
clients in violation of his duty to maintain confidentiali-
ty,’ the report says

That is a reference toa motion filed Nov. 1 by Jeffrey
R. Pack, a former Virginia Military Institute cadet who
was indicted Sept. 4 on six counts of selling the hallucin-
ogen psilocybin. In the 16-page motion for dismissal, he
and a former VMI student who was arrested for arson
this fall charge Read with violating the principle of
lawyer-client confidentiality

The two, who left VMI without graduating, say that
when they met with Read in his role as a private at-
torney, he gained drug-related information that he then
passed on to the special grand jury that investigated
local drug distribution

Read denied the allegation ina six-page response mo-
tion filed the next day. Both documents are included in
the appendix to the bar report.

Rockbridge Circuit Judge George E. Honts III said
this week that he has transferred the Pack case to
another judge because it was he who empanelled the
special grand jury and because of his heavy caseload.
Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III of Staunton, chief judge
of the 25th Judicial Circuit, has tentatively scheduled a
hearing on the motion for March 5 at 1:30 p.m. in the
Rockbridge County Courthouse.

~ Conduct of the special grand jury. In the fall of 1983,
Read, in conjunction with local law enforcement
agents, requested formation of a special grand jury to
investigate Rockbridge area drug trafficking.

The request came three weeks before the election in
which Read was running for a third four-year term. The
special grand jury was disbanded after a seven-month
investigation involving more than 200 witnesses.

‘Numerous incidents brought to the attention of the
committee evidence a pattern of conduct by Mr. Read
abusive of the Specia! Grand Jury process,’’ the bar
report says.

“Mr. Read’s attitude is exemplified by his statement
to attorney Wayne Heslep that although he might not be
able to get convictions on all the charges he would cer-
tainly embarrass a number of prominent citizens in the
community.”’

OPINION

Jan. 21

Can honor be found?

‘ At almost the same time every year, the Executive Com-
mittee asks for students who are willing to work on revisions
‘to the White Book, the bible of the Honor System here at
‘ Washington and Lee. And every year, in the tradition of Ro-
- bert E. Lee, students define through that committee what the
;current student generation considers honorable and
: dishonorable.
It is ironic that we celebrate Founders’ Day at about the
: Same time the posters advertising the formation of the White
' Book review committee begin to appear on the Colonnade.
Last year the students had enough respect for the ODK initia-
tion and President Wilson’s speech that almost 75 attended.
One only hopes that students respect the standards and vir-
tues that Lee embodied despite their absence from the
ceremony celebrating such ideals.

But the coincidence between few students’ attending Foun-
ders’ Day last year and the White Book Revisions Commit-
tee’s beginning to revise the Honor System is more than
ironic. It signals a subtle, but fundamental, change in the
way students view the Honor System and its creator, Lee.

Physical changes in the Honor System have come slowly in
the past. Only recently has the open trial been allowed for the
student’s appeal of his conviction at the closed hearing. But
changes in the perception of the Honor System have been
dramatic, both here and across the nation on various
campuses that have had healthy codes. Last fall, the Air
Force Academy revised its single-sanction system into a
system of graduated penalties. Temporary suspension and
expulsion are common punishments, and 19 students
previously expelled under the old Honor System have been
reinstated and will graduate from the Academy in the spring.
At Stanford University, a recent poll of the student body
shows that 94 percent believe in the Honor System strongly or
think it is a good idea. Amazingly, however, almost 33 per-
cent of those polled would not report a fellow student they
knew had cheated. Honor is a nice word, but it isn’t always
the best standard.

The time before us, then, is a time of great challenge. The
Honor System, governing all student affairs, is an integral
part of the University. In light of trends nationwide toward
skepticism about its workability, perhaps a serious study of
the state of the Honor System here at Washington and Lee is
in order. We may pride ourselves on our honesty in all our
transactions, but does honesty really govern our work? Can
we next Monday pay homage to the figure behind the Honor
System and sincerely believe in the same standards for
which he stood?

Some might call the association between honoring Lee and
Washington and the current state of the Honor System
exaggerated. Some say the relationship cannot be
overstated. It probably is better to err on the side of a close
relationship than none at all.

To the Editors:

Some changes are necessary in
parking procedures for campus par-
ties to be held in the new student acti-
vities pavilion.

Cars will be permitted to enter the
Liberty Hall fields directly from U.S.
60; attendants will be on duty to dir-
ect traific. That entrance will be
blocked, however, at 11 p.m, because
of extremely limited visibility — all
cars must exit by the Woods Creek
Apartment road.

All Law School and Woods Creek
parking lots will be available for

parking. All cars parked along the
access road in front of the apart-
ments will be towed, so please, car-
pool whenever possible. Two-way
traffic on all access roads must be
maintained in case of an emergency
With the cooperation of the student
body, we hope these changes will
help to avoid the traffic jams and
fender-benders of the previous par-
ties so that all attending can have a
good time with a minimum of hassle.
Have fun and don’t drive drunk!

MY VIEW

It’s that time again. Animals hiber-
nate in the furthest recesses of any
grotto available, birds withdraw to
well-constructed and insulated nests,
flowers retreat to subteranean dep-
ths awaiting spring, trees stand nak-
ed having discarded their burden-
some leaves, and the ill-equipped,
red-nosed, sniveling human runs
from building to building avoiding
discomfort. That’s right, boys, you
constitute that small, questionably
foolish minority who choose to with-

ithe most dismal time that pass-
es inthe Shenandoah Valley. A time
that transforms Lexington, the ma-
trix of the intellectual universe, into
a veritable ice-box. It’s winter, baby,
and though one must endure the poor
weather regardless of anything, ven-
ting a little hostility can warm the
chilly soul like numerous nips off a
flask of brandy.

MY VIEW

 

By John
Pensec

 

It was cool and clear that evening
last August when I was driving along
the New York Thruway a few miles
north of New Jersey and home. The
wooded stretches near Clarksville,
N.Y. are beautiful in the quiet, sum-
mer evenings. Beside me in the pass-
enger seat was a friend from high
school, a sophomore at Dartmouth.
We were talking about a mutual
friend at The Citadel when it happen-
ed. Glass shattered. Metal crunched.
Heads waved back and forth. The
noise was deafening.

For the next few moments, my life
felt as if it had been put into slow mo-
tion. I remembers my head being
thrown forward into the windshield
and then back into the headrest, giv-
ing mea severe case of whiplash.

My eyes were shut tight and when I
finally forced them open I found my-
self viewing the world upside down.
It felt as though I were on a roller
coaster but at the same time it was
unlike any ride I have ever ridden
before.

Quickly I shut my eyes, but sum-
moned the courage to open them
again a few seconds later. What met
my sight filled me with horror.

The car came to rest in a ditch by
the side of the road. The front end
was neatly molded into the shape of
the guardrail it had struck.

I came to rest about 10 feet from
the car after having been thrown
sideways out of the driver’s window.
My mouth was full of dirt and a few
pebbles. For a moment I could not
remember where I was.

At first glance, the damage to my
mom’s car did not appear to be so
bad; I even tried to punch some of the
dents out myself. But then I realized
that I had lost the glasses I wore

 

 

jwhile driving. Regrettably, I did not

seems unworthy of the South

Wardrobe reaches the apex of
creativity during these wintery mon-
ths, particularly among those of the
female gender. The word ‘‘creativi-
ty’’ is possibly less accurate than a
simple opportunity for more effec-
tive disguise. Robert Newhouse
thighs, Vasily Alexiev stomachs and
more chins than a Chinese phone
book are just some of the more
unsavory physical deformities that
may be camouflaged by a long, wool
plaid skirt, victorian turtle-neck and
a baggy solid green, pull-over sweat-
er. Wait, let us consider this not
altogether infrequent occurrence. An
empassioned man, motivated by the
primitive want of ‘‘warmth’’ on a
chilly Virginia evening’ occupies
inordinate amounts of time, money
and brain cells coercing his sweet lit-
tle love bird into his proverbial love
nest. But, loand behold, this frustrat-
ed playboy encounters not a balmy
romantic reprieve from the winter
coldness in the form of a tender, well-
formed fledgling, but rather a well
fed penguin. Walrus might also be fit-
ting.

Away from controversial issues,
the male dress code inspires laughter
as it occupies such a broad spectrum.

Winter fashions on the W&L campus
range from the pseudo-Wall Street,
Alvin Dennis man, complete with
trench coat, leather-palmed gloves,
and in the more hopeless cases, a
tweed brimmed hat, to the popular
union carpenter leather ----kickers,
complemented by faded blue jeans
and simply anything warm covering
the torso. The hat in the latter case
makes the outfit, and is normally the
classic baseball cap which, when re-
moved to alleviate the hassle of an it-
chy scalp, reveals a hair style echo-
ing a WWII German assault helmet.

Further, could an article concern-
ing winter be complete without ad-
dressing the grievous circumstances
those of us encounter when residing
in buildings unfit for sub 70-degree
weather? The architects, if they de-
serve such a title, obviously labored
under the grave misconception, ‘like
many others, that Virginia-‘is the
South. Anywhere the mean tempera-
ture for the month of January dips
below 65 degrees is unworthy of the
adjective Southern and is, in my esti-
mation, unworthy of being inhabited.
This brief digression aside, let us talk
about frozen pipes, which rule out
one of the most splendid of all lux-
uries, a warm shower.

Or what about the mysterious cold
spots and drafts that your landlord
attributes to the tenant’s mind-im-
posed para-psychological disturban-
ces, but your pocket infared heat
scanner traces to the large crevice
between your window sill and the
wall? If one should get that steamy
shower and locomote his scantily
clad body through the barrier of po-
lar air and push beyond the threshold
of pain, the wintry wonderland
awaits. Go ahead, step outside, don’t
forget to bring an ice pick to comb
your frozen hair and put on Chapstick
before both lips split in four places,

remarkable resemblance to ‘‘cold

lesser appendages to run for cover

‘ses interest in a new-found soprano.

Seriously, one could ramble inde-
finitely about inanities like those
heretofore expressed. All I ask is that
W&L embark on a fund drive to con-
struct a winter term retreat in Ja-
maica. I think we all would be much
happier and willing to intellectually
enlighten ourselves with the thought
of four-foot glassy peelers awaiting
us in the afternoon. Doobie wah!

for other’s decision

think about my friend still in the car
or even of myself. My only thought
was that my mother was going to kill
me.

I noticed that the hazard lights
were blinking. I must have turned
them on soon after the collision. I
don’t remember.

A gash in my leg was spurting
blood which ran down my leg and into
my deck shoes. Blood between the
toes squishes when you walk.

My friend was fine except for his
lower lip. He had bitten it in fear.
That natural response cost him five
stitches.

Two cars and a Greyhound bus had
pulled over to see if they could help
(no one will ever convince me that
the people of New York are cold-
hearted.)

The people who stopped applied
basic first aid, and in general took
over the whole situation. I was only
too glad to let them. They wanted me
to sit but a tremendous pain in my
lower back made it virtually impossi-
ble. A chill in the summer night made
it seem more like November instead
of August.

Two guys who had stopped took off
in pursuit of the hit-and-run driver.
He hadn’t traveled far, and soon
abandoned his car and proceeded to
walk along the side of the highway.
He said he was trying to walk home
to Brooklyn, about an eight-hour
walk. He resisted their attempts to
take him to the police but soon lost
the battle. He refused to take a
breathalyzer test the police attemp-
ted to administer. He said he did not
remember hitting us.

Very quickly an ambulance came
and took us to Nyack Hospital. I was
treated well, with one exception: the
nurse would not let me go to the bath-
room until the doctor had seen me.
That hurt more than the injuries to
my leg and back.

We arrived at the hospital shortly
after midnight, but it was almost two
hours before the doctor came and
took care of me. In the meantime, the
hospital called my home, and my

brother and sister came to take me
thonaht

hame nrenthev

The doctor thought that I may have

, damaged my kidney so they wanted

to keep me overnight and run tests in
the morning. My brother and sister
went home, taking my friend with
them. They would wake my parents
and tell them what had happened. I
meanwhile asked the doctor if I was
going to be moved to a private room.
He laughed and proceeded to extract
a sizable piece of glass from my
back.

I'll always remember the other oc-
cupants of the emergency room that
night. One man was wandering
around, having no idea who he was or
where he was, and a woman had call-
ed the paramedics because she had
an earache.

It turned out that my kidney, like
the rest of my body, was bruised. The
hospital released me in the morning.

The one thing I remember people
saying over and over was how lucky
my friend and I were. Undoubtedly
this is true. The glass in my back
could have done a great deal of da-
mage to a lung had it lodged in my
chest instead. Of course, someone
might have died in the accident. A
friend of mine had decided not to join
us that evening. She would have been
sitting in the back seat.

The driver of the car that hit us was
drunk. He couldn’t walk a straight

 

line, much less drive a car. Today, he
is free awaiting trial, his license sus-
pended. It is little consolation that he
may lose his license for up to three
years-one year for each offense.

He is 20 years old, and ironically, is
a student at the John Jay School of
Criminal Justice in New York City.
He will soon gain first-hand know-
ledge of the criminal justice system.
He decided to drink and drive. Now
he must pay for that decision. I am
sure that he will be inconvenienced
by not being able to drive, but if it
saves one person’s life, it will be
worth it. I’d rather not see him drive
ever again.

Think about his parents. They de-
serve more sympathy than he. Ob-
viously, I do not know what they are
thinking and feeling, and hopefully I
never will.

What I am thinking is that some-
day my life may once again be put in-
to the hands of their son or others like
him. I don’t like that.

So think about this the next time
you drink and drive. The cute sayings
about ‘‘friends don’t let friends drive
drunk”’ carries a lot of weight. When
you’re lying on the side of the road,
having been thrown from your car,
drinking and driving take on a new
significance.

committee, says in the report that when she was repre-
senting a special grand jury witness, Read forbade the
witness, a minor, from discussing the testimony with
anyone upon penalty of a misdemeanor prosection.
“When challenged on this point by Ms. Moore, Mr.
Read eventually told Ms. Moore that he had obtained
authority from a member of the State Attorney Gene-
ral’s office,” the report relates. ‘Ms. Moore later

parent violation of the law; ‘showed a disregard and

contempt for Grand Jury witnesses and their legal
counsels’; and questioned some witnesses, including

teenage females, about their sexual activity.

In addition, the document charges that Read ‘‘at-
tempted to have one attorney forcibly removed from
the Grand Jury room by the Sheriff of Rockbridge
County when the attorney attempted to consult with his
client.” It also says that certain information given to
the special grand jury appears to have been divulged to
law enforcement officers.

The bar procedure: What’s next?

The Rockbridge County-Buena Vis-
ta Bar Association has submitted its
report to the Virginia State Bar,
which is now conducting its own in-
vestigation of the charges contained
in the report.

“This committee, having no legal
investigative authority, is in no posi-
tion to pursue the truth or falsity of
these matters any further,” the re-
port states. ‘Accordingly, this com-
mittee recommends that its report
and accompanying documentation be
transmitted to the Virginia State Bar
for investigation and appropriate ac-
tion.”

According to the Code of Virginia,
each congressional district in the
state has a District Committee of the
State Bar that investigates charges
of misconduct that arise in that dis-
trict.

After a complaint such as the
Rockbridge bar’s report is received,
a preliminary investigation is laun-
ched. The committee then deter-
mines whether a hearing is warrant-
ed. A misconduct hearing is ‘‘con-
ducted as an adversary proceeding,”’
complete with witnesses and ‘ex-
hibits.

If the committee finds that the al-
leged misconduct has, in fact, occur-
red, a private reprimand is deli-
livered to the attorney and the mat-
ter is certified to the Virginia State
Bar Disciplinary Board for further
action.

The 12-member Board has several
options after hearing the case. It may
deliver a private reprimand to the at-
torney, deliver a public reprimand,
suspend the license of the attorney

 

“Prosecutorial misconduct.’’
The term has arisen several times
recently in connection with Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
‘‘John’’ Read, but he says he does-
n’t take the charge too seriously
when it comes from a man who’s
been convicted of more than a doz-
en felonies and is serving prison
sentences totaling more than 100
years.

In a motion filed Jan. 9 in U.S.
District Court in Lynchburg, Wil-
liam Edward Blair charges Read
with “prosecutorial misconduct”
and “misconduct and abuses of
the prosecutor.”’

Read says he worked with offi-
cials from 16 other jurisdictions to
coordinate evidence against
Blair, who was convicted in a 1981
Rockbridge County case for his in-
volvement in what Read called “‘a
rather large and substantial theft
ring.”

‘“‘We’re charging Mr. Read with

 

failure to supply exculpatory evi-

Mr. Blair that was withheld dur-
ing the trial,’’ said Blair’s at-
torney, Deborah C. Wyatt of Char-

“It goes to the very core of the
heart of our system,’’ she contin-
ued. ‘‘If you don’t disclose excul-
patory information, you're not
seeking truth. This duty is so fun-
damental that Mr. Read, if he’s
passed the bar, is aware of it. It’s
not something that he could not
know about.”’

“It’s what I call a fill-in-the-
blank lawsuit,’’ Read said yester-
day. ‘‘He can file this stuff indefin-
itely. I have a whole box full of it
upstairs. He’s appealed several of
them as far as the Virginia Su-
preme Court and he’s lost each
and every time.”

“He charges me with con-
spiracy,’’ Read said. “‘It’s true
that we coordinated that effort,
but it’s not against the law to coor-

 

 

dinate criminal prosecution.”’

“I'd say it’s a likely possibility, but
I don’t know enough to confirm it as

Mike Lehman, president of Pi Kap-

on. “I would agree with what Hay-

activities occurring at other fraterni-
ties,” he said.

Phi Kappa Sigma president Jim
Cobb, on the other hand, was unwill-
ing to agree that fraternities are en-
gaging in verboten pledge activities.

“At Phi Kap, we are not taking
time from our pledges that would be
unacceptable to the University or the
national chapter,’’ he said.

At Delta Tau Delta, president Rick

Gatti supported Haywood’s position.
“I do believe that there probably are
some houses doing things with

their national chapters would not ap-

“‘T don’t believe it’s because we en-

“When you join a frat, I don’t believe
it means you don’t want to be a stu-
dent at W&L. We spend no more time
on pledge education than in the

Trustees to talk tuition, coed

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Board of Trustees this weekend will set tui
tion for next year and continue grappling with the
nuts and bolts of implementing coeducation this
fall. but in the best Washington and Lee tradition
will take time out for a Friday night party.

Meeting in Atlanta, the 25-member board will
celebrate Robert E. Lee’s 178th birthday at the
8th annual “Lee Day’’ fete sponsored by the
alumni chapter there

‘Lee Day,” which since 1978 has been held on
the Friday ‘night closest to Lee’s birthday, will be
hosted by Beverly M. ‘‘Bo” DuBose III, a new
trustee and president of the Atlanta alumni chap-
ter He was elected in October and his term began
this month

‘“‘We want to celebrate the fact that we went to
W&L and we had a good time while we were there
and we enjoy getting together again to meet the
people we went to school with and others,”’ Du-
Bose said

“There are no talks, no speeches, no pressing
for anything. It just allows people who went to
W&L to gather and meet new friends and renew
old acquaintances. "’

DuBose expects 400 W&L celebrants at his At-
lanta home. They'll be greeted by an open bar as
well as fresh shrimp, crab claws, tenderloin,
chicken bits, and “‘you name it — it’s a full-blown
meal,’’ he said

Because the event is so helpful for encouraging
alumni involvement and impressing prospective
students, DuBose said he and the alumni office
are hoping other chapters will begin a similar
practice. ‘‘That’s the goal that we've set,” he
said

Back in the world of running the University, the
trustees will decide in their meetings Friday and
Saturday what the 1985-86 tuition will be, how
much the school will have available for financial
aid, and what changes will be made next year in
compensation for professors

University President John D. Wilson said the
question is not whether tuition will go up next fall,
but by how much. “We think we're facing an
economy of between 5 and 6 percent inflation, but
the expenses of the University seem to be increas-
ing by more than that,’’ he said.

Among the large budget items W&L is facing
are the additional faculty members who are be-
ing hired to implement the core curriculum. Ad-
ditional positions have been authorized in the

Romance languages to handle increased enroll-
ment in French and Spanish

Additional costs stem from the upcoming
change to coeducation, although Wilson says
those are ‘‘relatively modest expenses.”’

$150,000 has been budgeted for conversion of
washrooms, modifications of the dormitories and
changes in both indoor and outdoor athletic facili-
ties

A female athletic director and an associate
dean of students for women will be hired, and a
woman trainer may be added. ‘‘I’m not now plan-
ning any new personnel for security, but that may
change,” Wilson said

Dean of the College Pamela H. Simpson, who
heads the committee on coeducation, will present
her subcommittee’s recommended plan for con-
verting the dormitories to coeducational living.

Wilson said he will ask the Board for ‘‘a signal
if it would be wrong”’ to begin plans for renovat-
ing the currently unused building known as 32
University Place for use by the admissions and fi-
nancial aid offices rather than for faculty hous-
ing. The development office would then move into
the vacated rooms in Washington Hall.

The Board will also discuss a ‘‘fundraising ini-
tiative’’ for a new theater.

Food, not vigilantes, found in this Subway

 

By TED BYRD
Staff Reporter

 

Although many people associate
subways with vigilantes, the owners
of a new local restaurant hope you'll
think of sandwiches

The Subway sandwich shop, the
most recent restaurant to open in
Lexington, began business on Dec. 21
while Washington and Lee was on
Christmas vacation. The restaurant,
owned by Bob Luciano and David
Komonce, specializes in ‘‘New York
Style’ subs and features daily spec-
ials on Buschdraft.

The shop, located at 10'2 Lee Ave.,
has been doing excellent business
since W&L students returned, Lucia-
no said. Other local merchants ‘‘told
me to watch the students,"’ he con-
tinued, ‘‘but they've been very court-
eous and helpful”’ so far.

Luciano and Komonce intend to ca-
ter to the student community in Lex-
ington by ‘‘bringing a lower price to
food, keeping the beer prices really
down’’ and by staying open later than
most local restaurants. The Subway
is open from 11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and

from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday. In addition,
deliveries will be made from 8 p.m.
to 12:30 a.m. Monday through Satur-
day. All items on the menu, including
beer, are available for delivery. Fee
for delivery is $1.

The owners agreed that business

Friday and Saturday, the first week-
end that Washington and Lee stu-
dents had been back from break, was
great. ‘‘We sold over 600 sandwiches,
and about 80 percent of the crowd
was students,’’ Luciano reported. He
also mentioned that the shop seems
to be popular with women visiting

Luciano and Komonce are both na-
tives of New Jersey, but the former
has been in Lexington for about two
years and is the owner of the Country
Cupboard, a small store outside of
Lexington. The latter moved to Rock-

 

bridge County in October.

 

 

 

 

Local hospital opens renovated facility

 

By PETE BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington’s Stonewall Jackson
Hospital will celebrate the opening of
its recently renovated facility Satur-
day with tours, demonstrations by
medical teams and special services
for visitors.

The escorted tours begin at 10 a.m.
and end at 2 p.m. A medical helicop-
ter and several pieces of sophisticat-
ed medical equipment will be on dis-
play. Area rescue teams will demon-
strate cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion, blood pressure will be checked

for free and blood types will be tested
for $5. Refreshments will be served
after each guided tour.

Josephine McCown of the Washing-
ton and Lee infirmary said Stonewall
Jackson is responsible for many of
the medical services provided to
W&L students. Because of the infir-
mary’s limited facilities, several
hundred students are referred each
year to the hospital for laboratory
services, x-rays, emergency room
services and surgery.

Any services rendered by Stone-
wall Jackson Hospital must be paid
by the student.

vices at Stonewall Jackson do not

Students’ car overturns
on U.S. 60; none injured

 

From Staff Reports

 

Three Washington and Lee
students escaped injury Saturday
when the car in which they were rid-
ing overturned on U.S. 60 in Amherst
County.

The car, driven by sophomore Ke-
vin Cope, was traveling about 40 to 45
miles an hour when it ran off the
right shoulder of the road, according
to state police Trooper L.D. Bishop.
Cope overcorrected, Bishop said,
causing the car to cut back across
both lanes of the road and hit an
embankment on the left side. The

         
           

car, a 1979 Honda, turned over and
came toa rest on its top.

Cope and two passengers —sopho-
mores Tom Thagard and Lloyd Will-
cox — were going to Sweet Briar Col-
lege for a mixer.

The accident, which occurred
about 7 p.m., was eight miles east of
Buena Vista and nine-tenths of a mile
east of the Blue Ridge Parkway,
which divides Rockbridge and Am-
herst counties. The posted maximum
safe speed on that section of road is
30 miles an hour, Bishop said.

Cope, of San Marino, Calif., was
cited for reckless driving, according
to Bishop.

United Press International
reporter and former Washington and
Lee student Steve Hagey lived to tell
about it. Although five journalists re-
main the captives of various terrorist
groups in war-torn Lebanon, Hagey
was lucky.

A W&L English major who gradu-
ated in 1974, Hagey was named UPI’s
bureau chief in Lebanon in Decem-
ber 1983 and spent most of the past
year covering the terrorism, conflict
and death there.

Speaking to a W&L journalism
class yesterday, Hagey said, “From
the first day I got there, I heard gun-
fire, bombs and the works for a solid
year.”

Hagey said that life in Lebanon had
rapidly deteriorated during his year
there, and by December, he was rea-
dy to get out. ‘‘I noticed each time I
went out and then came back, it got
harder to come back,”’ he said.

But on Saturday, Dec. 29, Hagey
said, ‘The thing I feared most hap-
pened.”’ He and two other journalists
were kidnapped from a restaurant by
people he believed were ‘‘Lebanese
thugs” dissociated with any political
organization, he said.

Although Hagey said he told the
kidnappers he was a journalist, they
insisted that he was a CIA spy. The
three journalists were taken to Hag-
ey’s apartment, where they were
threatened and harrassed.

“IT was scared to death into believ-
ing that what they were going to do
was take me out and kill me,’’ he
said. ‘Grab another American, grab
another headline.”’

“I kept telling them I was a jour-
nalist,’’ he continued. ‘‘They were de-
nouncing Reagan, Israel, America,
all the while they were chain smok-
ing Winstons and Marlboros.”’

After a long ordeal, the other two
journalists escaped, and Hagey was
freed.

he didn’t know exactly what he was

Drop/add update

The registrar’s office processed
498 drop/add forms last week, as stu-
dents finalized their winter term
schedules, University registrar Har-
oldS. Head said.

“We always have more drop/adds
at the beginning of the winter term
because of students’ failing courses
or doing poorly in classes in the fall
term,’’ Head said.

Head said he noticed no appreci-
able changé in the number of
drop/add slips from winter term last
year, when 527 forms were turned in.

King Day celebration

 

From Staff Reports

 

Although blacks have come a long
way over the years, they still have a
long way to go, according to the Rev.
Rudolph Featherstone, speaking at a
program celebrating the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr.

Featherstone spoke to a crowd of
nearly 200 people Tuesday night at
the First Baptist Church of Lexing-
tén. The program was sponsored by
the Black Law Student Association
and the Student Association for Black
Unity of Washington and Lee and the
Promaji Club of Virginia Military In-
stitute.

Featherstone told the audience
that he questioned an economic re-
covery that has seen 1.3 million
blacks enter the unemployment line
and also questioned a system that
allowed for 8 million to be unemploy-
ed so that others can work.

Featherstone, a professor of theo-
logy at Trinity Lutheran Seminary in
Columbus, Ohio, also warned against
people of color that deny their heri-
tage to ‘‘just get by.”’ He said that
people should be proud of what they
are and of their heritage.

Featherstone’s primary teaching
area is the theology of Martin Luther
King Jr., and he also teaches courses
in black religion and social issues.

Two hunters found guilty
in connection with deaths

Two hunters were found guilty in
Rockbridge General District Court
yesterday of reckless use of a
firearm in connection with separate
fatal hunting accidents in the fall.

Judge Joseph E. Hess fined the
men $300 each and revoked their
hunting licenses for three years.

Thomas M. Moses, 27, of Natural

said Moses could have received a jail
sentence and could have been charg-

ed with something more serious.

“They obviously chose the charge
that carried the least penalty with
it,’’ Mann said.

Sem professor’s book turned into cable TV movie

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Sometime in March or April, a new
movie will premiere on Home Box
Office. Premiere movies are nothing
new for HBO, but what's different
about this one is that it is based on a
book by a Lexington resident and
Southern Seminary Junior College
professor.

“Dark But Full of Diamonds”’ is
the name of the book that has been
turned into the as yet untitled movie.
It is the fifth novel by Katie Lyle, who
teaches American literature and
English composition at Southern
Seminary. She also participated in
Washington Lee’s Summer Scholars
program for high school seniors last
year.

Like Lyle’s previous novels, the
subject of the book is teen-agers,
something she said developed from

her years of teaching. After 23 years
at Southern Seminary. she said che

feels sometimes that she is ‘‘not
much more than a teen-ager my-
self."

The movie tells the story of a 12-
year-old boy whose mother dies. His
affections for his mother then are
redirected to his swimming coach, a
girl several years older than he. The
story continues as the two are separ-
ated and meet again five years later.
By this time the boy has grown up
and the feelings of both characters
have changed.

Lyle said that although her novels
deal with children and teen-agers,
they are not strictly children’s books.
All five of her novels have been pub-
lished in both hardback and paper-
back by major publishers, and, Lyle
noted, several books have been pro-
tested as unfit for children because of
their sexual explicitness. Despite the
protests, Lyle’s first two books were
nominated for the Newberry Award
for excellence in children’s books and
were finalists in that national com-
petition.

Lyle’s latest works represent a
departure from fiction and a removal
from the topic of teen-agers. A year
ago, she published ‘‘Scalded to Death
by the Steam,” a book of stories and
songs about railroad wrecks. Just fi-
nished and being considered by pub-
lishers is a book about a 19th-century
West Virginia ghost story that also
involves a court case. These books
may not have wide readership, Lyle
admits, but they are about things
that interest her.

Personal interest plays a large
part in Lyle’s choosing her topics.
Lyle said her next project will be a
cookbook that she plans to write with
her sister. This will be a bit unusual,
though — it will be a collection of the
worst recipes ever. Lyle also has
written newspaper columns on mush-
room growing and bluegrass music,
and was one of five writers chosen to
work on a series for public television
on family problems and parenting.

The HBO movie is nearly finished,
Lyle said. All that remains is some

editing and soundtrack work. The
tentative title for the movie, the
producer told her, is ‘“‘Almost Like
Being in Love.’ The date the movie
will air has not been set.

The movie was shot in Toronto and
stars Lance Guest, whose last role
was the lead in ‘“‘The Last Starfight-
er.”’ Lyle’s 13-year-old son also audit-
ioned for a role in the film, but was
not chosen. He did win over the boy
who auditioned on the same day he
did, Lyle said. The other boy is the
son of actor Donald Sutherland.

Lyle’s feelings about the movie are
mixed. She said she is happy to have
one of her books made into a film, but
is not completely satisfied with the
screen treatment of her novel. ‘‘It’s
uncomfortable to have your work
changed and reshaped by somebody
else, she said. Although she partici-
pated in writing the script, she feels
that some important things were left
out. But, she sighed, ‘‘That's the way
it’s gotta be.”

Mesner case
called atypical

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

Last month’s dismissal of arson
and murder charges against Scot
Tanner Mesner was atypical, two
Washington and Lee law professors
said this week.

The professors, William S. Geimer
and Roger D. Groot, added, though,
that they could not second-guess
Rockbridge Circuit Judge George E.
Honts III’s dismissal of the case.

‘‘He had all the evidence, he heard
all the arguments and he gets paid to
make that decision,”’ Groot said.

The Dec. 21 dismissal of the charg-
es in connection with last spring’s
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house
fire came after Commonwealth’s At-
torney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read had
rested the prosecution’s case. Honts
held a two-hour hearing on Mesner’s
motion and deliberated in his cham-
bers for 45 minutes before dismissing
the case.

Announcing the dismissal, Honts
said Mesner’s due process of law
may have been violated by investiga-
tors who used a ‘‘suggestive’’ photo-
graphic lineup and failed to give Mes-
ner’s attorneys the names of witnes-
ses who could not identify him as
having been at the fire.

In cases such as this, in which the
prosecutor fails to turn over evidence
favorable to the defense, Geimer and
Groot said the defendant does not us-
ually, if ever, learn of such evidence
until after the trial.

“It’s unusual to have a dismissal
based on non-disclosed evidence
when that evidence is brought for-
ward or comes out before the end of
the trial,’ said Groot, who teaches
criminal law and criminal proced-
ure. “It’s the first flat-out dismissal
I’ve ever seen.”

Geimer, who teaches courses in
criminal law and judicial law and
was a defense attorney in North Car-
olina for eight years, said the dismis-
sal ‘certainly was fortuitous’ for
Mesner. Had the evidence come to
light after a conviction, Mesner
would have had to petition for a
retrial.

Geimer and Groot said Honts had

options other than dismissing the
case. For example, Groot said, Honts
could have denied the dismissal mo-
tion and later cited Read for con-
tempt of court for disobeying his
Nov. 8 order, which required Read to
give Mesner the names of witnesses
who could not identify him as having
been at the fire.

Acknowledging that the dismissal
was unusual, Honts declined to dis-
cuss other options that were avail-
able to him, “I spent an hour thinking
this thing through, and I don’t want to
be second-guessed,"’ he said.

Honts noted that Special Agent
Gerald Simpson, who investigated
the fire, testified that he showed a
single photograph of Mesner, rather
than a photograph of Mesner among
a group of photographs of other peo-
ple, toseven witnesses.

‘‘We started off with seven; we’ve
got three (former W&L law student
Warren Nowlin, W&L English
Professor Jean Dunbar, and her hus-
band, Peter Sils); where are the
other four?’’ Honts asked. ‘‘If you
don’t know who they are, how are you
going tofind out?”’

Groot and Geimer also agreed that
Read was responsible for informing
Mesner of any exculpatory evidence
— evidence that could tend to exone-
rate him — including names of wit-
nesses who could not identify him as
having been at the fire scene.

‘‘My opinion is that the stuff had to
be turned over, even without the or-
der, but with the order, it becomes
absolutely clear,” said Groot.

Lowering

By PETE BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

 

A recurring shock during the rush
that accompanies the beginning of
each term is the amount of money
spent on textbooks. Typical student
reactions range from ‘too much;
just outrageous”’ to ‘I don’t care—
I’m just charging it home anyway.”’

Are textbook prices really increas-

book prices may be difficult

ing? Yes, they are. Can anything be
done to lower them? Not really, ac-
cording to Bookstore Manager Hele-
na W. Roller.

Roller, who has been at W&L for a
year, after nine years at Mary Bald-
win College, says that everything
possible is being done to hold prices
down. In most cases, prices are dic-
tated by the publishing companies,
which require that prices be held

Medicare ‘revolution’
foreseen in law article

Changes enacted in the Medicare
system may revolutionize the system
by which Americans pay for their
health care, according to an article
by a Washington and Lee law profes-
sor and a W&L law student.

J. Timothy Philipps, professor of
law, and Don E. Wineberg, a third-
year law student from Chicago, are
the authors of an article titled
‘Medicare Prospective Payment: A
Quiet Revolution’ in the Fall 1984
issue of the West Virginia Law Re-
view,

In their article, Philipps and Wine-
berg review the changes in the Medi-
care system that resulted from the
Social Security Amendments of 1983
and make a series of predictions
about the eventual impact those
changes will have not only on Medi-
care but also the entire health care
industry.

According to Philipps, the new
system is based on a method of plac-
ing illnesses in 468 categories. A
specific price is placed on each of
those categories, and Medicare will
then reimburse a hospital that
amount.

“The hospital receives that stand-
ard payment regardless of the pa-
tient’s length of stay,”’ Philipps said.
“Tf the hospital is efficient and treats
the patient for less than the standard
Medicare payment for the particular
illness, then the hospital makes a
profit. If the stay is longer, then the
hospital loses money.

“So far the changes have resulted
ina decrease in the average length of
a hospital stay for Medicare patients.
The system is accomplishing one of
its goals — that is to hold down costs.
Hospitals have an incentive for effi-
cient health care delivery.”

The changes currently apply only
to in-patient hospital expenses. In
their article, Philipps and Wineberg
predict that the system will eventual-
ly be expanded to cover more servic-
es such as physicians’ fees and out-
patient services.

Possible effects of the change in
Medicare cited by Phillips and Wine-
berg include hospital specialization,
selectivity in technology use, chang-
es in service utilization, fewer hospi-
tal admissions and increased pread-
mission testing and outpatient treat-
ment.

above a certain level.

From the profit that the Bookstore
does make, postage for the books’ de-
livery must be paid, and then re-paid
to have any unused books returned to
the distributors, Roller noted. With
the February postage rate increase,
this amount will become even great-
er.

Also, the salaries of the store’s
workers have to be paid from the
store’s profit margin and the book-
store’s special services also cut into
the store’s profits. Check cashing,
special book orders and orders for
out-of-print books are all handled at
nocharge.

The best suggestion Roler had for
saving money is to buy used books,
though even those seem pretty ex-
pensive. Used books are handled by
an outside company, which buys
books at the general rate of 50 per-
cent of their current new value, and
re-sells them at 75 percent of that
value. Currently, only a small num-
ber of used books are available, but
Roller hopes this service may be ex-
panded in the near future by greater
effiency on the contractor’s part.

Roller said the most expensive
books are technical books, especially
computer books.

a hectic time for the Bookstore, with
the first day being the busiest. Two or
three extra workers are hired, and an
extra cash register and adding ma-
chines are installed to help shorten
lines. Roller added that limited
numbers of some books, delayed
shipments and the failure of some
professors to order their books have
added to the confusion.

Because professors have complete
autonomy in ordering books, simpli-
fying the Bookstore’s task is not
easy. Different reading lists for each
professor mean more paperwork,
more time spent sorting and pricing
and more money spent on postage.
Still, Roller said that morale among
the Bookstore workers is high, and
that ‘‘the work is never boring.”

According to Roller, the best way
to increase customer satisfaction is
communication. If students have
complaints or suggestions, they
should bring them to her. She said
she is open to ideas and willing to
help solve problems.

Immediate goals for the Bookstore
include organizing a spring sale to
match last fall’s Moonlight Madness
sale, Long term goals include compu-
terizing the store’s charge and inven-
tory systems and ultimately revamp-
ing the interior of the store.

Automatic Rule threatens 94 students

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Students who fail to meet minimum academic
standards fall under the automatic rule — ‘‘sever
their connection with the University,’’ in the
words of the Catalogue.

That sounds drastic, but administrators say
there are good reasons for the rule.

“The logic behind the Automatic Rule is not to
punish students, but to protect them,’’ said Pame-
la H. Simpson, associate dean of the college at
W&L and chairman of the Automatic Rule Com-
mittee. ‘‘Letting students do inadequate work
gets them in a deeper and deeper hole with their
GPA.”

She said the Automatic Rule is designed to en-
sure that students progress toward attaining
their degree within the prescribed time. A stu-
dent’s progress is measured by his cumulative
grade point average.

The required GPAs by the end of the academic
year are 1.5 for freshmen, 1.6 for sophomores, 1.8
for juniors and 1.9 for seniors.

Simpson said those are the minimums that will

Washington and Lee student, you should be able
to do Washington and Lee work,”’ she said.

Removing students who fail to do adequate
work from the University prevents them from
falling too far behind in their work toward their
degree, Simpson explained. It also allows them
time to correct any problems they may have had
that affected their work.

Students who fail to meet the Automatic Rule
requirements are dropped from the University
for a minimum of a year, unless they are immed-
iately reinstated. Immediate reinstatement is
granted only under extenuating circumstances,
such as illness or personal problems.

Those students who are dropped may petition
for reinstatement. The petition must show that
the problem that caused the inadequate work has
been corrected.

A student who has been reinstated is automat-
ically on academic probation and must achieve a
1.9 for his fall term. At the end of the academic
year of his reinstatement, his GPA must equal or
exceed the requirements for his class. If he fails
to meet any one of these conditions, he is per-
manently dropped from the University.

Before being subject to the Automatic Rule, a

Simpson said that is to warn students of the dan-
ger they are in.

A student is placed on academic probation
when he fails to attain the cumulative averages
required by the Automatic Rule at the end of
either his fall or winter term. Students on proba-
tion may participate in no more than one extra-
curricular activity.

There are currently 94 students on academic
probation, including 73 freshmen. Last year at
this time, only 76 students were on probation with
50 of them being freshmen. Two years ago, the
number of students was 70. Only 33 freshmen
were on probation at that time.

Simpson attributed the rise in the number of
students on probation to the new curricular
requirements. ‘‘Students are forced to take things
they may not want to take,”’ she said

Simpson said the University makes a big effort
to counsel students who are having difficulty.
Freshmen who are not at or above a 1.5 at mid-
term or at the end of the term are asked to meet
with a dean. Students who have GPAs between 1,5
and 1.9 receive a letter on the Automatic Rule in-
forming them of its consequences. Students are

also urged to talk with their advisers when they
have difficulty.

EC reviews yearbook budget report

 

BY STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The budget report for Washington
and Lee’s yearbook, Calyx, came un-
der some scrutiny at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

According to the report submitted
by Calyx Business Manager Burf
Smith, yearbook revenues were
$31,714 as of Jan. 14 while expenses
were $10,314.

“What is remaining will go toward
publishing costs,’’ Smith explained at
the meeting. He also noted that he
would like advertisement sales,
which have not yet been figured in, to
produce $6,000.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers mentioned that only $2,000
was made from advertising last
year, but Smith said that higher
amounts were earned in previous
years and that he has two motivated
ad salesmen.

Junior representative Pat Hayden
questioned Smith about a flip-flop on

outstanding accounts owed by frater-
nities.

‘‘What’s holding it up now is deter-
mining who has possibly paid and
who hasn’t,”’ Smith said.

Following the meeting, Smith said
one house owes $100 for one-half year
and one house owes $600 for three
years. He also believes that six
houses each owe $200 for one year.
Although this would add up to $1,900,
Smith said he can only be sure about
$1,300 because three of the six houses
may have paid.

Calyx Editor David Sprunt said
after the meeting that Phi Gamma
Delta is the fraternity that owes the
$600. Smith did not comment on the
names of other houses owing money
at this time.

Smith did say that no pictures will
be taken this year until houses pay
this year’s $200 and any back money
owed. Nobody at the meeting ques-
tioned the inconsistency of including
$1,900 in revenues for outstanding
fees and zero revenues for this year’s
fees when neither has been paid.

In other business, EC Vice Presi-
dent James White, sitting in for Pres-
ident Cole Dawson, reminded mem-
bers that students wishing to serve on
the White Book Revisions Committee
must submit their names to the EC
by Monday.

Junior representative Michael
Black reported that the band Speidel,
Goodrich and Goggin is scheduled to
perform in the Cockpit on Friday,
Feb. 8, to benefit the United Way. It
was noted that students attending
this weekend’s George Thorogood
concert at the Pavilion may bring as
many guests as they like, but W&L
students must have a student ID (or
library card and photo ID) to be

admitted.

Caruthers reported that the Voting
Regulations Board will meet this
week to try and ‘‘revamp the anti-
quated regulations.”’ Caruthers also
said efforts are underway to upgrade
the school’s outside lighting system.

Black mentioned that the EC minu-
tes are not being posted on campus
on time. Freshman representative
Brandt Wood said that he has receiv-
ed four or five reports about items
having been stolen from his hall in
the dorms.

‘‘Let’s talk about that in Executive
Session,’’ White said.
The meeting was adjourned at 7:50

p.m., at which time the EC went into
Executive Session.

Martinez choreographs
duels in Chicago ‘Hamlet’ .

Joseph Martinez, assistant pro-
fessor of drama, recently completed
choreographing the duels in ‘‘Ham-
let’ for the Wisdom Bridge Theatre
Company of Chicago.

The Wisdom Bridge Theatre is a
celebrated professional theatre com-
pany that has produced many criti-
cally acclaimed world premieres in
Chicago during the last 10 years.
“The current production of ““Ham-
let,” featuring Aidden Quinn, star of
the film ‘‘Reckless,”’ in the leading
role, will open in Chicago Jan. 31.

In pre-performance publicity, Chi-
cago Magazine said of Martinez, ‘‘Jo-

seph Martinez is the only outstanding
stage fight choreographer Chicago
has ever produced.”

Martinez received his bachelor’s
degree from Illinois Wesleyan Univ-
ersity and a diploma from the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Arts in Lon-
don. He has served as instructor at
the University of Denver and the
Goodman School of Drama and was
an assistant professor of drama at
Virginia Commonwealth University,
the Valley Studio, Western Illinois
University and the University of IIli-
nois. He is the author of a book on
stage combat titled, ‘Combat Mi-
me.”

Admissions
maintains size

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

No additional admissions staffers
are needed despite the upturn in in-

 

. terest in Washington and Lee by high

school seniors this year that has dra-
matically increased the work load of
admissions officers and the student
recruitment committee, according to
admissions officers.

‘*We’ve had a tremendous increase
in the work load, but we’ve been able
to handle it,” said Van Pate, assoc-
iate director of admissions. ‘‘We've
been busy, but it’s been a good kind of
busy.’’

One measure of the work load is
that the admissions office already
has received 1,344 applications, 979
from men and 365 from women. Last
year by Jan. 14 the admissions office
had received 779 applications from
male students.

Pate said that admissions office
personnel had to work during the
first week in January, the last week
of students’ vacations, in order to
handle the large backlog of mail that
had built up during Christmas week.

Pate said it was the number of in-
terviews the staff had to conduct that
also placed a heavy strain on admis-
sions officers.

At the end of the year the admis-
sions office will consider if additional
staff members are needed, but sev-
eral factors weigh against an in-
crease in staff size, Pate said. Even
with the present staff level, one ad-
missions counselor has his office on
the third floor of Washington Hall,
away from the main admissions of-
fice. If any additional staff members
were added it would be almost impos-
sible to find office space for them
near the main office, Pate explained.

The student recruitment commit-
tee, which gives prospective students
tours of the campus, also has been
busier than in previous years. Glen
Jackson, head of the committee,
noted that this year, during peak
hours on Mondays and Fridays two
student guides have had to be on duty
instead of the usual one.

He added that guides frequently
have led larger groups around cam-
pus than in previous years.

Jackson and Pate agreed, how-
ever, that the student recruitment
committee should retain its present
size of 49 guides next year, and Pate
added that he was not aware of any
plan to increase student recruit-
ment’s size.

“Of course, if you take around four
people instead of two people you
don’t get the same individualized

 

Coeducation:

What Will It Mean?

attention,” Jackson said. ‘‘But I
think our guys have done a great job
this year.”’

Pate asserted there is not a pro-
blem regarding prospective students
not getting enough attention from the
guides if there are just two or three
students in a group. But he added
that tour groups do get a little un-
wieldy when there are a couple of big
families in a group.

Sometimes a larger tour group
could even be an advantage, Pate
commented. With more people in the
group someone might ask a question
that another person was interested in
but forgot to ask, he explained.

Another phenomenon related to the
increased interest in Washington and
Lee this year is that some students
who might have had an outside
chance to get into Washington and
Lee in the past are ‘“‘self-selecting’’
themselves out of the admissions pic-
ture this year because of the increas-
ed size of the applicant pool.

“Applicants know by osmosis how
good a candidate for admission that
they are,” Pate said. ‘‘Some people
realized that this year W&L is not go-
ing to be realistic’ for them.

Pate said the admissions office has
not yet compiled any statistics that
would validate any claims about the
quality of the applicant pool, but the
students seem to be both qualified
academically and very active in their
schools and communities.

Likewise, the admissions office has
no statistical information regarding
how W&L is faring against tradition-
al recruiting rivals such as the Univ-
ersity of Virginia, the College of
William & Mary and Duke. Pate indi-
cated that the admissions office will
eventually survey all applicants who
were offered admission to find out
what other schools they considered
and why they selected or did not
select W&L.

“Students and especially parents
now see W&L as what U.Va. was
when there were only 3,000 under-
graduates there,” Pate said.

Pate noted that the deadline for ap-
plications is Feb. 1. Last year, 1,502
applications for admission were re-
ceived.

The aide said that Wilkins always
has been in favor of raising the drink-

Food Services Director Jerry Dar-

‘the Cockpit may very well fail.’’

Despite putting in a new menu in
response to customer’s suggestions,
the Cockpit had lost more than $2,300
by Dec. 1 of last term.

‘‘We’ve done everything we could
think of, but the students just aren’t
coming down,” Darrell said. ‘‘We’re
not going to try to improve our bus-
iness by having more happy hours.’’

A drinking age of 21 may be the
fina] nail in the coffin for the Cockpit,
Darrell said, because the University
probably won’t want to subsidize a.
beer pub that can cater to only a
quarter of the students.

law would necessarily alter the
“frenzied drinking that we have’’ at
W&L.

“T think it would be naive to think
that a new law would significantly
change students’ drinking behavior,”
he said. “The obvious impact is on
public drinking.’’

For example, acquiring an Alcoho-
lic Beverage Control Board license
for the sale of beer at the pavilion
during concerts or dances will be-
come impossible, according to John.

“Those who sponsor social events
will have to be a little more creative”’
in providing entertainment, he said.

John said he opposes a_ higher
drinking age.

‘There are other ways to achieve
the objective of decreasing drunk
driving...and raising the drinking
age is not necessarily the best,’’ he
said.

In the upcoming school year Dar-
rell foresees the Cockpit as a gather-
ing place for W&L women, and he is,
therefore, planning to do a ‘“‘little re-
modeling.”’

A ‘higher drinking age would
necessitate the introduction of
“mocktails,”’ exotic drinks without
alcohol. Darrell mentioned that
‘Pink Ladies’’ would be one addition
to the menu for next year.

“I’ve received a lot of helpful input
from students and the Coeducation
Committee,”’ Darrell said in regard
to changes for the Cockpit and other
food services.

In the event of a higher drinking
age Darrell said that more emphasis
will have to be placed on non-alcoho-
lic aspects of the Cockpit, such as
entertainment.

He suggested that a video recorder
may be purchased or that afternoon
soaps may be shown next year.

Darrell sees no problem enforcing
a new drinking law.

“Carding is not really a problem
now...The guys do a pretty good job
down there,’’ he said,

Cruisin’

Big Lex

For once, a view from the other side of the radar gun

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

In covering the police station for The Ring-tum Phi
this year, I’ve probably come into contact with the
police as much as anyone else (with the possible excep-
tion of some rather hardcore partiers). Yet most of this
time has been rather haphazard at best.

The police have instigated a ride-along program in
which citizens and students actually ride with an officer
on his patrol.

In the interest of learning more about the police
department (and getting my editors off my back) I
sacrificed the usual fraternity party on Friday night
and spent from 9:15 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. riding in a patrol
car with Officer F.W. Smith.

Smith is a two-year member of the force and lives in
Buena Vista with his wife and three children. Due to the
massive firings which occurred several years ago after
the police theft ring was uncovered, Smith is the third
highest ranking officer in terms of seniority.

The evening started off with a quick tour of the station
house and an explanation of the various little gadgets
found within the patrol cars, especially the ‘Alco Sen-
sor II,’’ and the infamous radar we all love so much.
(Attempts to sabotage the device were foiled by Smith,
who expected such a move on my part. )

We began our night by checking the various schools
and offices in the surrounding area, especially the car
dealerships to ensure everything was locked up secure-
ly.

Around 10 p.m. we pulled into one of his favorite

speed trap locations (I have been sworn to secrecy) and
watched the magical radar. We also began to compare
notes on the various girls’ schools. Smith turned out to
know more about the schools than I did, and as the night
wore on it became increasingly embarrassing to have
all these girls know him by name. Smith felt that the
prettiest girls came from Hollins.

Around 11 p.m., we headed back to the station to
check in with the other shift, which had just started.
Busy nights usually meant there were four cars patrol-
ing.

The usual shop talk commenced and each officer
made note of which houses were having parties, who
had noise permits, how crowded the local bars were,
and the general feeling on how the night was going to
be.

We left the station house around 11:15 and went back
to a Law School party we had visited earlier. Several
cars were illegally parked and Smith had gone in to
warn the owners to move them.

Obviously, by the time we had come back little had
been done and one of the other officers called in a tow
truck. Amazingly, all the cars were moved within five
minutes after the tow truck appeared. (We also got a
call from the dispatcher that a neighbor had called
complaining about all the red lights and asking us to
turn them off.)

Smith and I continued on our patrol. He showed me a
few more hiding spots he frequented and we pulled into
one to try and catch some speeders. It was during these
frequent stops that I learned more about the various
officers in the force and some of the basic policies they
try to follow.

One such policy, which Smith stuck to throughout the
night, was to constantly check on the other officers. As
anyone who watches cop shows knows, the dispatcher
gives and receives messages to and from the officers.
Any time an officer leaves his car, he radios this to the
dispatcher. Since all the cars carry the same frequency
radios, each officer can keep in constant touch with the
others. Therefore, when one officer left his car the
others would constantly drive by and make sure he did-
n’t have any problems.

At 12:20 p.m., a call came to investigate a domestic
problem. Smith said these were some of the worst be-
cause one never knew what to expect. ‘‘Just imagine
getting a call saying, ‘See the woman.’ It could be
anything from getting attacked by an irate gun-toting
husband to getting a cat out of a tree,”’ he said.

The seriousness of the call became even more evident
when all four cars pulled up to the house. In this case
there was no real problem and the cars soon left and
continued their respective rounds.

At 1:30 a.m., things began to pick up for us. I got my
first chance at real excitement as we raced down the
streets of Lexington, lights flashing, after a possible
DUI suspect. Once again, we were foiled in our at-
tempts at our first catch of the night.

Later in the night, while driving down Washington
Street near the Centel office, we spotted two youths try-
ing to make off with a ladder. By the time we had turned
to give chase the suspects had fled but we credited our-
selves with once again foiling the criminal elements of
Lexingtén.

After checking out the ladder, we spotted a car full of
girls go by. A quick silent agreement and we were after

them. After all, there were more than two people in the
front seat and the driver was a cute blond

This was my first chance to watch tongues of Hollins’
finest convince Lexington’s finest that her BMW ‘‘just
had a mind of its own.” No sooner had we stopped than
she was jumping out of the car, blabbering some incom-
prehensible story that I did not even try to decipher.

I say she was from Hollins merely because my now
professionally trained detective eye had noticed the 2-
foot “Hollins” sticker on her back window and the
“‘WhereinthehellisHollinsCollege”’ bumper sticker.

Smith let her rave on for about five minutes and then
asked her if she was from Hollins. (He too had noticed
the stickers.) Well this just threw the girl for a loop, and
she proceeded to go on and on and on about how smart
and brave he must be. Seeing me rolling on the hood of
the police car in laughter gave Smith the excuse to hand
the girl back her license, after rearranging the seating,
and sent them on their way.

The rest of the evening proceeded at a slower pace.
What could possibly top that last episode? We did stop a
few more cars that seemed to be swerving but never
caught a DUI. It seemed almost as bad as snipe hunt-
ing.

Around 3 a.m. we called it a night. Smith filled up the
old cruiser and we went in and filled out the mileage
charts, duty rosters and all that other police stuff.

Though we didn’t catch any DUIs or have any mur-
ders or break-ins, the night was pretty fun. I guess hav-
ing a slow night is really the best thing that could hap-
pen, for the police and especially for us. Until next
week, when I get to cover the 10 p.m. to1 a.m. action at
Wendy’s drive-thru window.

Before today, only white salt fell

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

Last Thursday, rumors and threats
of snow were flying like leaves on a
fall afternoon. Students began to re-
think their plans for the weekend,
and the radio kept promising a blank-
et of snow before Friday morning
crept around.

‘But the snow never came.

_ So why were the streets covered in
salt for the snowstorm that never
came?

David Woody, a member of the
Lexington Department of Public
Works, said, ‘‘We know it looked bad,
but we had to doit.”’

Woody said that Thursday night’s
preparation cost between $2,400 and

_ $2,500. That may seem like a great

deal of money to spend on a simple

snow storm, but Woody said that an
operation of this kind can run as high
as $4,000.

 

The department must rely on the
same information that the public
receives, he explained. They must
judge a storm’s arrival by radio
broadcasts as well as information
from the National Weather Service.

In most cases, the department will
get the preparations underway as
early as a day prior to the storm, if
the information is available. Two
driving crews of about five are set to
the task. These drivers are present
employees of the department who al-
so work as street patching crews,
water sewer crews, and the like.

The two crews constitute a day
shift and a night shift. The prepara-
tion begins by checking the depart-
ment’s stockpiles in order to ensure
that an ample supply of sand, abra-
sives, and salt is available. In addi-
tion, the trucks are checked for pro-
blems and snow plows are added to
some.

ODK

 

O Continued from Page 1

Frank A. Parsons, executive assis-
tant to University President John D.
Wilson, said at the time that he was
“embarrassed for the University”
because of last year’s poor atten-
dance.

At one time, attendance at
Founders’ Day events was not op-
tional.

Until the 1969-70 academic year,
the University Catalogue stated that
a student ‘‘is required to attend”’ cer-
tain ‘‘compulsory assemblies.”’

But since 1970, the catalog simply
has said that students are ‘‘expected
toattend.”

The outlook for this year’s con-
vocation is much brighter, according
to religion Professor David W.
Sprunt, ODK faculty advisor, who
said he is expecting a good turnout.
He added that 115 people have made
reservations for the ODK luncheon
following the convocation.

Better publicity about Founders’
Day as well as a ‘‘growing interest’’
in the concepts of ODK should spark

a high turnout for the ceremonies,
Sprunt said.

Sprunt added that he thinks the
ceremonies would be well attended
even if someone as well known as
Huntley weren’t speaking. ‘‘I don’t
think the interest hinges totally on
who the speaker is, but rather the
ceremonies themselves,”’ he said.

Sprunt couldn’t speculate as to
what the title of Huntley’s speech,
“The Way We Were,” refers to. He
did say, however, ‘‘It should be in-
teresting.”’

Chapter V, Section 3, of the Bylaws
of the University requires that
classes be cancelled on Founders’
Day. Despite that requirement,
classes will only be shortened to
leave students free to attend the
ceremonies. Monday’s class sched-
ule is as follows:

A Hour: 8:00-8:40

B: 8:45-9:25

C: 9:30-10:10

D: 10:15-10:55

E: 11:00-11:40

F: 11:45-12:25

Assembly: 12:30

night costs nearly $40 a ton. The de-
partment used 25 tons that evening,
so that explains a large part of the
cost. The salt is only effective in
temperatures above 23 degrees Fa-
hrenheit, so lower temperatures re-
quire a mixture of salt and various
abrasives for sleet and ice, small
stones and sand are applied to the
streets.

The day in which the snow falls al-
so plays a major role on the price of
the operation, Woody said. If the
streets can be taken care of before
closing time, then labor costs are
held to a minimum, However, in the
case of Thursday night, the workers
were all working on overtime. Simi-
larly, a snow scheduled to arrive on a
weekend or a holiday can escalate
costs significantly.

Although Thursday’s storm warn-
ing was a false alarm, the next one
may not be. The Public Works De-
partment will be ready.

Fawcett to appeal verdict
of U.Va. honor hearing

 

From Staff Reports

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — The
University of Virginia sophomore
found guilty in a public hearing
last fall of an honor violation will
appeal the verdict in another
public hearing Feb. 2.

The student, Monique Fawcett,
was accused of turning in for
regrading a mathematics test on
which the grade had been altered
and several grader’s marks had
been changed.

Fawcett, however, will not
return to U.Va. even if she wins
her appeal, according to yester-

Colleges’ tax-exempt land
part of ‘good relationship’

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

When five Lexington Fire Depart-
ment trucks answered an alarm at
the Commerce School in November,
one of those watching the action was
Charles F’. Phillips Jr., mayor of Lex-
ington and a Washington and Lee
economics professor.

“‘Tax-free property, and you bring
out all this equipment?’’ he needled
Edward C. Atwood, dean of the W&L
Commerce School, after the two had
been told the alarm was simply
because of some smoke from a blown
electrical transformer. ‘‘I’ll send you
a bill!” ras

Phillips was only joking, but not
everyone is amused by the tax-free
status enjoyed by all W&L and Vir-
ginia Military Institute real estate.
All non-profit organizations are ex-
empt from the tax, the largest source
of revenue for the city.

Courtney P. Baker, Lexington’s
commissioner of revenue, said there
is ‘‘very much, too much’’ tax free
real estate in the city.

“The tax-exempt property here
has a greater value than the taxable
property, which is very difficult,”
she said. “‘I don’t think you’d find
many localities where that situation
exists.”

Only 44 percent of the assessed
value of Lexington land is taxable.
W&L, for example, sits on $71,818,500
worth of land — 28 percent of the
value of the real estate in the whole
city.

If property taxes could have been
collected on the 56 percent of Lex-
ington land that is tax-exempt, the
city would have an_ additional
$1,411,827.42 entering its coffers this

 

day’s Cavalier Daily, a U.Va. stu-
dent newspaper. Fawcett is
quoted in the newspaper as saying
she is appealing merely ‘“‘to set
the record straight.”’

At U.Va., a student convicted of
an honor violation can appeal only
if new evidence comes to light or if
a procedural error was made in
the original trial.

As at Faweett’s original trial,
the appeal jury will consist of 12
students — four members of the
Honor Committee and _ eight
students selected at large.

Faweett’s original conviction
Sept. 30 came after a 12-hour trial.
At least 10 of the 12 jurors had to
vote guilty for her to be convicted.

fiscal year.

“Obviously, if we had a larger tax
base, each person would have to pay
less tax,” Baker said. “The city
government just has to run the city
on what it is able to collect.’’

That being the case, do city leaders
and citizens harbor resentment
toward the universities and other
tax-free properties within the Lex-
ington limits?

Absolutely not, says Baker.

“The colleges are very important
to Lexington — they’re very wound
together,’’ she said. ‘‘People are hap-
py the schools are here. I think they
feel Lexington is a nice community,
and it is enhanced by the schools.”’

Baker said W&L and VMI also con-
tribute significantly to the economic
health of the area. For example, she
said a number of clothing stores and
restaurants could not survive without
the business generated by the
schools. :

“‘One services the other,”’ she said.
‘‘There are a number of businesses
here that are here because of the

students and faculty. At the same
time, it is convenient for the students
and faculty that those businesses are
here.”

“I believe they’re very interrelated
and I believe it’s a good relation-
ship,”’ she added.

By law, property values are
reassessed by independent ap-
praisers every four years. The pro-
cess was completed in Lexington just
prior to this fiscal year, which began
July 1.

Since the institutions hold their
land in perpetuity, some property
values are difficult to determine
since no market can exist for them.
How, for example, did officials deter-
mine that the land the VMI Parade

Ground sits on is worth $72,000?

“T would think that evaluating
things like a football stadium or the
VMI Parade Ground would be some-
what subjective,’’ Baker said. ‘‘But
we do have land sales in town, so you
do have something to relate it to”’

Other local sources of city i.
are a personal property tax on
automobiles and business furniture
and fixtures, a 2 percent tax on
restaurant food and transient lodging
and a business license tax.

At W&L, only facilities that are us-
ed for educational purposes are tax-
exempt. For example, tax is paid on
the school’s Alumni House and on
undeveloped land holdings.

Because VMI’s land is owned by
the state, the school has no parcels on
which it pays tax.

Both institutions pay a_ service
charge for faculty and staff housing
at a rate that may not exceed 50 per-
cent of the real estate tax rate.

Lexington is not the only Virginia
locality with a high percentage of
tax-exempt land. In Portsmouth, for
example, nearly 60 percent of the
property is tax exempt. Federal
government holdings account for 90
percent of that.

In Charlottesville, both the Univer-
sity of Virginia and the University of
Virginia Hospital, the main economic
bases of the city, are exempt from
property taxes.

A joint House-Senate subcom-
mittee of the state legislature has
been formed to study ways to ease
the financial burden on localities
with such high concentrations of tax-
exempt land.

Increasing service charges for non-
profit organizations is one of the key
proposals the group is examining.

from the field.

Although Maryville’s free throw
percentage (66.7 percent) was only
slightly less than W&L’s (70.5 per-
cent), the Generals attempted 22
more free throws than the Scots and
gained an overwhelming margin at

The winter term has gotten off to a spotless

sports teams. The swimmers won their third
dual meet of the season in as many tries witha
61-44 performance against Towson State. The
wrestlers recorded wins three, four and five on
Saturday. They also are undefeated. And the
cagers are on their hottest roll of the young
season, winning four in a row since classes
resumed. They go for No. 5 tonight in the
Center against

the Generals’ winter

ultra-arch-rival

 

 

The Generals established the first
major lead in the game when they led
the Scots 15-10 early in the first half.
Maryville, however, rallied and out-
scored the Generals 7-0 and took their
first lead in the ballgame at 17-15
with six minutes left in the half. The
Scots could not continue their mo-
mentum and only scored two points
in the remainder of the half. Shannon
put the Generals ahead 18-17 with
5:34 on the clock when he completed
a three point play. W&L took a 24-19
lead into the locker room at halftime.

Maryville scored first in the second
half to cut the Generals’ lead to three
points. Working patiently against
Maryville’s man to man defense, the
Generals built an eight-point cushion
and led the Scots 36-28 when Shannon
hit two free throws with 12:33
remaining in the game.

Maryville then applied a full court
press fo the Generals offense that
produced several quick scores and
cut W&L’s lead to four points, 38-34,
with 8:30 to play. The Generals then
outscored Maryville 16-6 and led the
Scots by 14 points 54-40 with two min-
utes left in the game. The Generals
turned the ball over a few times in
the last minutes and allowed Mary-
ville to cut into their large lead, but
they held on to win the game by a
final score of 58-52.

Tonight the Generals face arch-
rival Roanoke in the Warner Center
with the tip-off scheduled for 7:30.

A delay of more than a month bet-
ween dual meets did not affect the
Washington and Lee swimming team
as it continued its winning ways with
a 61-44 win at Towson State.

Before the meet, Coach Page Rem-
illard was concerned with how the
team would do after a month of in-
tense workouts, but afterward he was
able toenjoy the victory.

“I was very happy with the way we
swam against a very good Towson
team,” said Remillard. ‘‘We have
been working hard in practice and I
wanted to use this meet as a gauge to
see how far we had come. The team,
as a whole, performed very well,
with most of our swimmers near
their best times.”’

There were many outstanding per-
formances this past week and one
was turned in by All-American Taber
Smith. Smith, who had mononucleo-
sisis through Thanksgiving, won the
50-yard freestyle in 22.95.

“Tam very happy for Taber Smith,
who seems on the road to recovery.
He showed everyone a lot with his
performance in the 50-yard free,’’
commented coach Remillard.

Remillard was also pleased with
the swimming of freshman Simon
Perez, who won the 200-free in a time
of 1:49.23. Perez’s winning time was
also his lifetime best in that event.

“It is exciting to project what he
will eventually be able to do, con-
sidering he swam that fast after our
heavy workouts,”’ said Remillard.

‘“‘T shouldn’t be at my best yet,
since we have been working so hard

recently,’’ Perez said. ‘‘When we
taper our training in a few weeks, I
should do even better.”

Perez said it was tough coming
back during Christmas but he was
also pleased with its outcome.

Roanoke currently has a 7-4 overall
record and a 2-2 ODAC record. Last
night Roanoke was defeated by
ODAC leader Maryville in Roanoke.

The W&L vs. Roanoke game has a
rich history and it appears that this
year’s game will write another excit-
ing chapter. ‘“‘The Roanoke game will
take care of itself,’’ said Coach Can-
field. Canfield said that he knows a
large number of W&L fans will at-
tend tonight’s game and help the
Generals utilize their very important
home court advantage. Coach Can-
field sincerely appreciates those who
attend the Generals’ home games
regularly and reminds those who
don’t that they are missing an ex-
citing W&L team.

Last weekend the Generals picked

Invitational tournament. The Gene-

‘Sure it was a lot of hard work, but
I would like to look back at the end of
the season and attribute my success
to those 10 days.”

The team’s victory over Towson
was “‘iced,’’ as Remillard likes to
say, when the divers, Mark Chiap-
para and Tom Amico, won their
events. Amico won the one-meter
dive with 156.85 points.

“I also have to congratulate the
divers; and in particular Tom Ami-
co, who has come along very well and
has made a significant contribution,”’
Remillard said. ‘‘They are not a high
priority, but they work hard and we
can’t live without them.”’

“Mark and I work hard, we video
tape our dives and watch,” said Ami-
co. ‘‘We’re looking to improve our-
selves, do better than the week be-
fore, and with that will come more
competitiveness.”’

This year’s swimming team is
made up of many freshmen, who are
experiencing heavier workouts than
they’ve been used to. But the team’s
3-0 start is due to the leadership of the
seniors, according to Perez.

“It’s been tough making it through
one year,” said Perez. ‘‘That’s why
we all look up to the seniors who have
been doing it for four.”’

This weekend the Generals will
swim in a double dual meet against
Georgetown University and Frost-
burg State at Frostburg.

Wrestlers open new year with wins

 

From Staff Reports

 

Despite being without the services
of senior captain Jeff Dixon, the
Washington and Lee wrestlers came
away with three impressive wins at
Saturday’s Hampden-Sydney Quad-
rangular, upping their undefeated
string to five. The trip to Farmville
yielded victories over Johns Hopkins
(33-9), Hampden-Sydney (34-11) and
Loyola (47-3).

“I thought the team really made up
for the loss of Dixon,’’ Coach Gary
Franke said. ‘‘We got some early
wins at the lower weight levels that
made things easier for us.”’

In the Generals’ opening match of
the quad, W&L faced Johns Hopkins,
a team that the Generals beat by only
six points last year. Franke expected
a closer match, but saw the dif-
ference as being in the Generals’
ability to perform up to their poten-
tial at the lower weights.

Franke said pins from Jeff Mazza
(134 Ibs.) and Larry Anker (142)
were keys to the team’s win. ‘“‘Those
two falls put the match almost out of
reach for them. I think it took a little
bit of the punch out of them.”

W&L closed out the match with
wins at the last four weight classes.
Generals Win Phillips (167), Greg
Kendrick (177) and Mark Weaver
(HWT) all recorded decisions, and
Joe O’Neill pinned his opponent at 190
Ibs.

In their second match of the after-
noon, a pair of early forfeits, coupled
with Anker’s one-point decision at 142
gave the Generals another early
lead WRT. again ran out the match
with the heavier weight classes, win-
ning four of the last six bouts.

“T think we did a little bit better
this time than when we faced them
before (a 38-15 win Nov. 28),”’ Franke

Sydney Quad by winning his three individual bouts.

said. “They (Hampden-Sydney) just
don’t have the manpower we do.”

Franke said the Generals used
some of their depth in the final match
against Loyola. ‘“‘We used some extra
people who performed well,”’ he said.
The Generals won nine of the 10
bouts.

For the day, triple winners for
W&L were Mazza, Phillips, Kendrick
and Weaver, while O’Neill, Anker
and 118-pounder Steve Castle record-
ed two wins during the afternoon.

Saturday, the Generals play host
for a four-team event, featuring
squads from Division I schools: Duke
(a 35-7 winner over the Generals last
year) and VMI, and Pittsburgh-area
Division III school Washington and
Jefferson, whom W&L turned back
22-21a year ago.

“It will be a real challenge this
weekend,” Franke said. ‘‘We should
have a real close one with W&J,” he
added, indicating that the Generals

   
   

will again be without 190-pounder
Dixon. Franke expects the senior,
who is recovering from arthroscopic
knee surgery, to be ready for the
W&L College Invitational on Jan. 26.

Franke said the scheduling of Divi-
sion I opponents can be beneficial to
the team, especially for the wrestlers
as individuals.

“Some of the good competition can
lead us to improvement in our
preparation for the Eastern
Regionals (Feb. 14-16). It’s an area
that, I think, we need to concentrate
a little more on. I think we have some
people capable of wrestling at that
level,” he said.

Moses: still
a class act

..What a week to talk about

TIME sports! Everything and everybody

from Dan Marino and Edwin Moses

OUT. ee. (© prostitution and the Roanoke

a SS game look to be fair game from this

4 ; corner, so let us begin with the taint-

' ing of the Olympians in the past few

days. The blood doping, drug-test

failures, etc., etc., have

(fortunately) reached a point of oversaturation. Recognizing the pro-

blem is old hat. Combating it is the next step, but it is a step that is

simply not feasible. As an East German sports official has pointed out

in the past, it just doesn’t really matter what drug tests they develop,

there will always be a way to get around them if that’s what you want
to do. Sad, perhaps, but true.

This revelation (is it a revelation?) coupled with the Moses arrest
over the weekend has a good many people wondering where our heroes
have gone. A USA TODAY (M-O-U-S-E) story Tuesday examines
(cough, cough) some of the situation in which Moses’ agent said the
hurdler was merely joking when approached by the female under
cover agent. In the article, Penn State sports historian (does he teach
a class?) Ron Smith said Moses would probably come out “fairly
pure’ if compared with Babe Ruth. Smith also concluded, “I guess we
expect our heroes to be something better than the rest of us.”’

Gee, Ron, who clued you in? I don’t know about you but my idea of a
hero used to include that forgotten (?) notion of the role model. Moses
has said that an athlete is put in a position of ‘‘heavy responsibility
whether he wants it or not.’’ Does this make him susceptible to having
his character trashed by public airing, regardless of the validity of the
charges? (Does this sound like the pot calling the kettle black’ It
should.) In other words, are we, the public, to see athletes only for
their wonderful performances on the playing field and remain ig
norant of their life without the uniform? Is it fair to put them on a
pedestal?

I have said in the past that athletes are people, too (of all things!) ;
they do make mistakes. But this fallibility is not an excuse. The
responsibility Moses talks of is something an athlete cannot ignore.
I’m not asking them to be saints (some of them, it would seem, have
difficulty in reaching the level of us sinners) ; rather, I would wish that
they act with the knowledge of their place as public figures. At the
same time, I’d wish the public would remember that athletes are not
immune to mistakes.

In the end with the Moses situation, let us remember that one inci-
dent does not a man’s character make. Edwin Moses is and always
will be a class individual and a credit to the athletic world. You can in-
fer whatever you want about my opinion of the charges leveled against
him....

...Coming home to coherence and the Colonnade, you're fooling
nobody when you say the General cagers are hot. We'll find out how
hot tonight, but let’s put it this way: If you’re wearing maroon, don’t
expect it to be a good night. Seriously, though, the Generals have won
four in a row because they have controlled tempo and shall we say,
have a firm grasp on their potential... Speaking of firm grasps on
potential, Coach Gary Franke’s wrestlers are at least as hot as the
cagers and get a well-deserved round of applause from this cor-
ner...And one more tip of the cap, this time to the swimmers, as they
are undefeated after three...January has thus been super, Generally

....Other news of note: Oh yeah, that affair in California this Sunday.
Can't waitfor OJ.and Tom Landry on the pre-game show, but then I’m
impressed by the darnedest things. The prediction? I think the 49ers
have a better defense, better enough to make a difference in this Star
Wars clash of the QBs, and since Joe Montana's name is a letter longer
than Dan Marino’s, we’re going to have to go with Frisco. The line
says three, we’ll say 10...

....Finally, a note from the For What It’s Worth Dept.: Marty Flet-
cher’s Keydets lost an early-season game to Old Dominion by four
points. The Monarchs lost Sunday to No. 13 DePaul by six. Point: Get
to Cameron Hall if the occasion permits itself. Ron Carter’s ghost may
be stirring....

Pavilion opens 1985
with some changes

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page”’ Editor

 

There will be a few changes at
Saturday's Student Activities Board
concert in the pavilion, but SAB
Entertainment Director John Hay-
wood said most students won't notice
the changes or have any less fun
because of them

The most notable change will be a
limit on the amount of beer that can
be purchased by concert spectators.
Haywood said that when someone is
admitted to the pavilion, he will be
able to purchase three beer tickets
for the whole evening.

Although the Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board will be keeping a
watchful eye on this concert,
Haywood said, they had nothing to do
with the limit on beer purchases.
Rather, the featured attraction
(George Thorogood and the Dele-
ware Destroyers) is the cause of the

limit.

‘Thorogood normally does not play
where beer is sold,’’ Haywood said.
“This is a compromise on both parts
to have beer at the concert.”’

Haywood said this rule applies only
to this concert, and the beer distribu-
tion will be normal for next week’s
Ramones concert.

Another change for this concert is
the addition of paid bartenders and
security. In the past, Haywood said,
these chores have been handled by
SAB members.

“It’s not that the SAB members
weren't doing a good job, it’s because
they only work shifts up to an hour or
so, and we need people to work the
whole night,’’ Haywood said.

This concert is the beginning of the
SAB’s attempt to bring big name acts
into the pavilion on a regular basis,
Haywood said. ‘Whether the student
body supports the concert or not will
determine whether or not we can con-
tinue to bring in these national re-

 

cording acts,’ he added.

The concert Saturday evening will
be opened by the Skip Castro Band
from Charlottesville. Castro is a fam-
iliar attraction in Lexington and has
played this area for a number of
years. Two years ago, they were one
of the featured acts at the W&L Mus-
cular Dystrophy Superdance.

The main attraction for the even-
ing will be Thorogood’s group. The
Destroyers released their first album
in 1977 and packed up their instru-
ments in a Chevy Suburban to tour
both coasts that same year.

Since that time, the Destroyers
have been successful with four gold
albums and drew rave reviews on
tour as the opening act for the Rolling
Stones in 1981 and 1982.

Advance ticket sales are far ahead
of those for any previous pavilion
concert, said Haywood, adding that
he is looking for a capacity crowd.
“This will probably be the best show
we've had in the pavilion.”

PAVILIONPOINTERS

* Tickets are on sale for $6.50 now through 4 p.m. Friday at the W&L
Bookstore.

¢ Advance ticket purchases are encouraged so that spectators can
move into the pavilion quickly.

¢ Proper proof of age, as well as proof that you are a W&L student,
will be required at the door.

¢ Guests from outside the W&L community are welcome, but must
be accompanied by a W&L student. (Note: Students from area
women’s colleges are considered members of the W&L community.)

¢ Spectators will be allowed to purchase only three beer tickets with
each admission.

¢ No outside cans or bottles will be permitted to go into the pavilion.
Students who fail to comply with security requests to surrender
alcohol will be removed from the pavilion.

¢ Any spectator deemed ‘‘out of control’’ or obnoxious to other spec-
tators by security will be removed from the pavilion.

Robert Vincent O’Niel’s ‘‘Avenging

“‘Angel’’ left off. Now Angel is a re-

Ju’s art, personality similar

 

By BOB STRICKLAND
Staff Reporter

 

While I asked I-Hsiung Ju about his
art, he began a watercolor. His
abrupt, spontaneous technique is
duplicated in his personality: he
throws out a doctrine of Chinese
philosophy as he dashes the color on-
to the paper. Ju’s serious artistic side
is counterbalanced by his quick wit.
By the time he had answered my
question, I was taken by the nature of
his Eastern sensibility and by the
fact that he had already finished the
watercolor that he had only begun as
I asked my question.

Ju’s works are on display until Jan.
25 at the duPont Gallery. A native of
China, Ju left the country for the
Phillipines during the Communist
takeover to continue his studies and
teach art. He comes from a family of
artists and always has been attracted
to the creative culture. Ju has held
numerous one-man shows in Austral-
ia, Canada, England, Japan and the
United States. He currently is the
artist-in-residence and an assistant
professor of art at Washington and
Lee.

In order to appreciate his work,
one must understand Ju’s aesthetic
stance. His approach to art is loaded
with Chinese philosophy that is quite
unlike Western thought. It takes ma-
ny years for a Chinese artist to mas-
ter the art of calligraphy and water-
color painting. But once the artist has
perfected his craft, he is able to
create spontaneous images without
much forethought.

Ju compares his art to that of a
dancer. When one is first learning
how to perform a maneuver, much
thought and attention must must be
spent in perfecting it. Once the mane-
uver is perfected, and the dancer
becomes very good, he does not have
to think about his actions.

Ju says that spontaneity is the key
to his work. After witnessing his
quick style, I certainly was convinc-
ed this is the case. His show is made
up mostly of abstract pieces.

The ideas that give stimulus to his
abstract work come from an inner
feeling, Ju says ‘It just happened.
No plan. Just spontaneous,”’ he add-
ed. Unlike other artists who complete
their art in their minds, Ju does not
finish a piece until the last brush-
stroke is executed. What may start
out as a chrysanthemum painting
may eventually turn into an abstract
piece as testified by the calligraphy
in “Phoenix (1)’’ Ju reforms old
paintings into new ones.

The creative process is always at
work as the product of spontaneity
and the artist’s mood. Ju compares
his technique to the performing arts.
As dancers follow movement, his art
follows a music of the mind. His

brush pauses, jumps, leaps, twists,

laughable, as if director O’Niel simp-
ly said, ‘‘Here are your lines. En-
joy.” In fact, the most confusing
aspect of this picture, playing at the
Lyric, is whether it was meant to be a
comedy with serious overtones, or

 

  

W&L artist-in-residence I-Hsiung Ju has new exhibit in duPont Gallery,

but is never drawn.

In his ‘Noh Dance,”’ Ju’s calligrap-
hy explains his fascination with rhy-
thm and movement “‘I have seen the
Japanese Noh dance in which the
dancer moves his body just like the
writer of Chinese calligraphy moves
his brush in accordance with the ris-
ing and falling of cadence...I there-
fore am interested in making this
kind of painting for it is based on
calligraphy.”

Chinese painting requires perfect
control of the brush; there is no room
for error. Ju’s brushwork has a fasci-
nating disciplined freedom. One can
sense the quick, rhythmic strokes
both in his traditional Chinese pieces
and in his abstract work. The rhythm
is dependent on his mood as the rhy-
thm of music depends on the style,
whether it be jazz or classical. Dark,
disturbing backgrounds testify to
Ju’s mood at the time of creation.
Likewise, a singing bird on paper is a
product of a happy mood.

Most of the works in the current
show are abstract. Ju takes natural
objects and transforms them by his
artistic gift into abstract forms. In
“‘Roots,”’ Ju is not interested in repli-
cating roots in the ground; rather, he
manipulates the sensual forms inher-
ent in nature to make an abstract
piece.

Ju also has a couple of traditional
Chinese landscape works that, as us-
ual, are perfectly executed. He is
quick to point out that a bird or but-
terfly on the canvas may have been
an accident—such as a dropped blob
of paint—that has been transformed
and recreated by the artist. Not only
is Ju’s technique that of a master
craftsman; his artistic sensibility is
equally outstanding. He asserts that
an expert painter with no ideas is like
a beautiful body without a spirit; the
person is virtually reduced to the sta-
tus of a lifeless mannequin. This per-
son can always be an expert painter,
but never an artist. The duPont ex-
hibit, however, gives evidence to an
artist who can combine both body
and spirit in his art to create a beauty
with substance.

simply one of those movies that takes
itself too seriously and becomes fun-
ny asa result.

There were a couple of redeeming
moments in this sequel. Certainly,
the irony of Angel returning to Holly-
wood to avenge her guardian’s death
is an amusing thought to play with,
but the memorable sequence had
Angel working to save a 13-year-old
prostitute from what she herself had
experienced as a teen prostitute.

 

Overall, ‘‘Avenging Angel”’ is not
that good a movie. It seems to reach
for a goal and winds up falling short
of that goal, leaving the audience
laughing at the wrong time. In this
respect, however, ‘“‘Avenging Angel”’
just might attract a following at the
box office.
