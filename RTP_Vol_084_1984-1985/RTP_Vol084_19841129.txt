One-fifth of frosh midterms below 1.5

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

More than one-fifth of the freshman

, Class received midterm grade point

averages lower than 1.5, the ‘‘auto-

* matic rule’’ cutoff point for fresh-
. men

If a student’s grades fall below 1.5

at the end of his freshman year, the

’ automatic rule dictates that he con-

, Sequently ‘‘severs his connection
with the University.’

A student who fails to meet the

* minimum required G.P.A. at the end
, of any term is placed on academic
probation for the following term,
* meaning that he is eligible to parti-

cipate in only one extracurricular ac-
tivity

According to figures released this
week by Dean of Freshmen H. Ro-
bert Huntley, 79 freshmen, or 21 per-
cent of the class, fell below the 1.5
mark.

Since approximately 70 percent of
the class pledged fraternities, a large
number of those failing freshmen are
certainly in houses. University regu-
lations forbid the initiation of any
freshman with a G.P.A. lower than
1.9.

Although most fraternities provide
a ‘‘cold’’ test file and some informal
tutoring from upperclassmen, only a
few have concentrated programs to
assist pledges with academics.

One that does is Chi Psi, which has

grades that fall below 2.5

“We also get pledges together with
brothers who are majoring in areas
in which pledges are having difficul-
ty,” said Chi Psi member George Bo-
ras.

Like Chi Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
has mandatory study halls for some
of its pledges. In addition, it has a
W&L law student who serves as a re-
sidential educational adviser

Third-year student Jim Kay’s posi-
tion is unique among W&L fraterni-
ties. He receives a monthly stipend
from the national SAE office

“Pledges under a 2.5 are required
to attend a study hall three nights a
week for several hours,”’ Kay said. ‘‘I
try to have an atmosphere that pro-

motes a couple hours of work a day.”

“T encourage them to study during
our C-School sessions, but I don’t
force them to study — they can sleep
if they want to.”’

Delta Tau Delta also has sought
outside assistance. ‘‘We had a couple
of professors come in and speak to us
on how to study—Professor Elmes
was one,”’ said Mike Marshall of
Delta Tau Delta.

“We also have a big brother pro-
gram to check up on their work as
well as to make tutoring available.”’

Sigma Phi Epsilon has found
another way to motivate pledges’
academic performance.

“We have a cash award for the
freshman who has the highest GPA
and for the one who improves the

Jim Hansen of Sigma Nu said his

said the fraternity has several re
quired study halls

At Beta Theta Pi, Lee Cummings
recognizes imminent problems for
their pledges.

‘“‘We have some pledges that are in
extreme trouble,’’ Cummings said
‘We know which classes they are
having trouble in and we try to give

them help.”’
“It’s one thing to have a good
time,’ he continued, ‘‘but it’s

another thing to throw your grades
away.”

John Falk of Sigma Chi said that
pledge trainer Pete Braden plans to
Start holding mandatory study halls
for finals week for those pledges with

Ed Buttarazzi of Pi Kappa Phi said
his house has a cold test file and

Alex Chambers sees Phi Delta The

“We get them to come to us and we

said. ‘‘We tell the pledges to go to the

have any mandatory study halls
though.”’
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s adviser

Kay gave another reason for holding
study halls

‘Since I have already accepted a
job and am quite apathetic about my
own studies, these study halls make
me study as well, so I can hopefully
graduate. These guys get me to work

WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Concert tomorrow
may typify future

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee student
activities pavilion will be back in ac-
tion tomorrow night when the Stu-
dent Activities Board presents a
Christmas concert featuring the Pro-
ducers and the White Animals.

This is the second concert in the
new structure, and, according to SAB
Entertainment Director John Hay-
wood, the pavilion is 90 percent com-
plete.

“The main thing people will notice
is the fact that the parking lot has not
been finished.’’ Haywood said.
“We're still encouraging people to
get there early and to carpool when-
ever possible.”’

One addition to the pavilion since
its inaugural event, the Homecoming
concert, is the nearly “‘indestructi-
ble’’ Mondoflex floor covering. This
addition will most certainly make the
concert a more enjoyable event for
all those in attendance.

One thing that has not changed
since the last concert is the closing of
the U.S. 60 entrance to the pavilion.
Haywood stressed that the only way
to enter and exit the pavilion is
through the road that leads to the
Law School.

The success of this concert will
have a bearing on the future enter-

Dec. Mesner trial

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read has re-
quested subpoenas for 34 indivi-
duals to testify at the trial of Scot
T. Mesner, the 19-year-old indict-
ed for arson and murder in con-
nection with last spring’s Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity house
fire.

Mesner’s trial is scheduled for
Dec. 19-21 in Rockbridge County
Circuit Court.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John
is among those scheduled to be
called as witnesses.

Read has also requested sam-
ples of three types of hair from
Mesner, who has been held in
Rockbridge, County Jail since
Sept. 4.

tainment that the SAB will book into
the pavilion, Haywood said.

“Right now, we’re trying to deter-
mine the kind of bands the University
will support,’’ he added. ‘“‘We would
like to bring in more current national
acts, but we have to make sure that
the University will pay the higher
ticket price that is necessary to af-
ford those kinds of acts.”’

The addition of the new pavilion
has given the SAB the opportunity to
provide the kind of concerts that we
will be seeing Friday night.

“We could never have put on this
kind of show in the dining hall,”
Haywood said. ‘Phere isn’t enough
room in there to hold the number of
people we'll be seeing Friday night.”

Haywood added that because the
dining hall was only available to
them once a term, they had to plan
far in advance any concerts they
would provide. The Producers only
became available three and a half
weeks before Friday’s date and
never could have been booked back
in September, Haywood said.

‘“‘The emphasis of the pavilion is on
University wide events, but other
groups canuse the building,’ he said.

For the bargain basement price of
$75, a group can rent the building.
Messy groups beware, though, clean-
up costs are extra.

Haywood said the SAB will even
take care of the entertainment. ‘If a
group tells us what kind of act they
want and how much money they have
to spend, we will go out and book the
entertainment for them.”’

He added that the SAB will encour-
age inter-fraternity events in the
pavilion.

Local favorites The Nabobs will
open the concert promptly at 8:30
and will play a 45-minute set. The
Producers will start up at 9:30 sharp
and will play one long set until the
White Animals begin at 11:30. Hay-
wood said there will be a short break
between each band to prepare the
stage for the next act.

Tickets for the concert are $5 in ad-
vance and $6 at the door. Tickets are
available in the W&L Bookstore until
Friday afternoon at 4. Haywood said
he is encouraging people to buy their
tickets in advance. He added that
people with advance tickets will
move into the pavilion more quickly
than those who purchase tickets at
the door.

A’student glances at Larry Stene’s sculpture in the main lobby of the library.

‘Interesting...unconventional’

mystery, makes them curious and allows their mind to

fantasize.”

Among students in the library earlier this week, re-

 

action to ‘‘‘Fortress Flying” was mixed.

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Students entering the University Library this week
have expressed differing reactions toward the sculp-
ture greeting them in the main level lobby.

“It’s interesting to watch people come into the lobby,
to see their expressions and to hear their comments
about the sculpture,”’ said Bob Strickland, a junior who
works at the circulation desk.

The seulpture, ‘Fortress Flying,”’ by Larry Stene,
assistant professor of art, consists of a plywood frame,
glue and Vermont flooring slate. It weighs about 250
pounds and is four feet tall by three feet wide. The
pieces of slate had to be cut and beveled to create
Stene’s conception, he said, adding, ‘‘A lot of calisthe-
nics have to be done to get to the fun.”

Stene said the sculpture is not necessarily intended
to have any particular meaning.

“The neutrality of the ‘Fortress Flying’ pushes the
responsibility of what the piece means upon its audi-
ence,’’ Stene said. By displaying the sculpture in the
library, Stene explained that he thought more people
would be able tosee his work.

Stene said he believes that art should be created for
the reactions of people instead of for financial gain.

“Art is narcissistic,’’ he added, “with the idea of
coming back to the artist. A painter shouldn’t paint
pretty pictures to make money. His creations are put
out to generate response.”

The response — whether positive or negative — is
important to the artist, Stene said, because it is the on-
ly way he has of determining how the audience feels
about his work.

“The piece is only the catalyst,’ he explained.
‘When people look at that piece, I hope it’s like a good

 

“T could care less if it’s there or not,” freshman Bill
Lilly said. ‘‘It’s nice if it’s a donation.”

Another student, senior Mark Knobloch, said he en-
joyed the piece.

“It’s violent and energetic,’’ Knobloch added. “‘The
gaps in the slate provide intrigue into the three dimen-
sionality.”’

Several students said the sculpture seemed out of
place in the middle of the University Library.

“The way the library is set up, that area is not condu-
cive to having anything in it,’’ said senior Tom Imeson.
‘Where it is now, people won't stop to take the time to
look atit.”’

Strickland also said many students don’t even notice
the sculpture.

“A lot of students don’t want to be seen looking at
something so unconventional,”’ added Strickland, who
said he thinks the sculpture is great because “it looks
different from eachside.”’

University Librarian Maurice D. Leach said, “I’m
pleased to have something out there that people are in-
terested in.”

Stene said he was not especially surprised by W&L
students’ not noticing the sculpture because the Ameri-
can public and W&L students in general sometimes
have a limited, narrow view of art.

Some people ‘‘are conditioned to feel that they don’t
have the artist’s permission to interpret the piece,”’ he
added. The ideal situation, he said, would be when a
person looks at the sculpture and creates a world for it.

“IT want my artwork to be easy,”’ Stene said. ‘‘When
art gets taken out of the gallery and put into everyday
life, that’s when it can delight the most people.”’

 

 

ng investigated by EC

 

 

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Complaints about Virginia Military
Institute cadets using Washington
and Lee’s University Library and
abusing the privilege have been
reported to the Executive Commit-
tee, but the EC member investi-
gating the complaints said not much
can be done.

Junior representative Michael
Black brought the issue to the EC’s
attention three weeks ago. Black said
this week that, during midterms, he
asked a VMI cadet to move from a
conference room to a study carrell
Black said the cadet refused, claim-
ing that he was ‘‘there first.”’

“IT don’t mind them using the li
brary, but I just think around exam
time they stampede the library,’’
Black added. ‘‘They’re loud, and
some of them are not very consi-
derate of W&L students. I don’t real-
ly think they realize they’re guests
here.”

“T feel they’re abusing the privi
lege of using the W&L library,
especially around midterms and ex
ams,”’ he continued

Senior law representative Gordy
Hammock, a 1982 graduate of VMI,
said he will write a column for the
VMI newspaper and will ask student
and faculty leaders there to warn the
cadets that some people think a pro-
blem exists

Hammock also said that he will ask
VMI Commandant Col. John W
Cummings to inform the cadets in
writing that some complaints have
been made

“T think it'll have a little bit of
weight with them,’’ Hammock said

University Librarian Maurice
Leach said he hasn't heard of any
problems with cadets this year, but
that there are some problems when
both schools’ exams coincide and
W&L students complain that cadets
are using conference rooms or books
that they don’t think the cadets have
a right to

But Leach said that can't be helped

because of the agreement that allows
cadets touse W&L’s library, and vice
versa

“The policy is to create and breed
good will between the two institu-
tions,’ Leach said

“IT certainly would not advocate
denying the resources here to VMI
cadets any more than I would a law
student who comes over here,’’ he
said

Black also reported that cadets
often talk rather than study in the
library

‘As far as we can see in the li
brary,’’ Leach said, ‘‘there is no pro-
blem in that area.”’

Although there was a problem with
noise in the library last year, that
seems to have been solved this year,
Leach said

“The test will really be when our
exams take place,”’ he said

William Sargeant and Steven Me
deiros, two of about 20 cadets who ap
peared to be studying quietly in the
library Monday night, said they find

OPINION

 

Crying foul

On page 5 of a University of Virginia honor system pam-
phlet is a quotation from the university’s founding father,
Thomas Jefferson:

‘‘Never suppose that in any possible situation or under any
circumstances that it is best for you to do a dishonorable
thing however slightly so it may appear to you.”

Oh?

Witness the case of one Olden Polynice, a sophomore (or,
as they’d say in Charlottesville, second-year student) accus-
ed of an honor violation for turning in another student’s Eng-
lish paper as his own last spring.

During a 21-hour closed honor trial two weekends ago,
Polynice admitted to turning in the other student’s paper,
according to accounts last week in The Washington Post,
which quoted ‘knowledgeable sources.”’ (At U.Va., as at
W&L, an honor trial is closed unless the accused wishes it to
be open. )

The case, however, did not end there. You see, Polynice
also happens to play basketball at U.Va. and is an integral
member of a team that went to the much coveted Final Four
last year.

At his honor trial, Polynice, his counsel and U.Va. head
basketball coach Terry Holland argued that pressure from
the coaching staff for Polynice to complete his work for the
course led him to turn in another student’s paper as his own,
according to the Post. They further said that Polynice was
not attempting to defraud U.Va.’s grading system.

Although we cannot condone Polynice’s apparently dishen-
orable action, we do realize the pressures a 19-year-old univ-
ersity student sometimes faces. And those pressures are
even more intense if that student is a highly recruited
member of a major college basketball team (or team in any
other sport, for that matter).

But that is not the point. The point is that Polynice, if the
Post’s account is accurate, committed an honor violation. At
U.Va., as at Washington and Lee, the only punishment for a
student found guilty of an honor violation is expulsion.

Olden Polynice, however, is still at U.Va. and still playing
basketball(in Hawaii last weekend). He is retaking that elu-
sive English composition course.

We could argue about the evils of big-time athletics and the
problems that occur when student/athletes place too much

emphasis on the latter half of that combination. But we’ll
leave those arguments to the sports page.

More germane to Washington and Lee, where sports, we
hope, will never play such a dominant role, is the honor
aspect of this case. To be convicted of an honor violation at
U.Va., a student must not only have committed the act, but
he must have done so intentionally and willingly, and the act
must have been ‘‘a serious enough breach of trust to warrant
permanent expulsion{from the University.”’ .

The 12-student jury that heard Polynice’s case apparently
decided that because of the pressures placed on him by the

basketball team, he really did not mean to commit an honor
violation and his violation was not serious enough to warrant
his expulsion.

An honor system — a true honor system — can work only as
long as honor is not measured in degrees. We can under-
stand, at least in part, the requirement of intent at U.Va. The
requirement of seriousness, however, essentially makes one
honor violation more or less dishonorable than another

The lesson for the guardians of the honor system at
Washington and Lee is that honor cannot — indeed, must not

- be measured in degrees. Either a student is honorable or

he is not, and the only punishment must be meted out accor-

dingly. Honor measured in degrees cannot be called honor.

The University of Virginia seems to have forgotten the wise
words of its founder. Let us always remember them.

‘A Trivial Pursuit’

We promise to leave her alone eventually, but before we
do:
eLisa Birnbach’s College Book was panned in the recent
edition of Newsweek On Campus as “‘A Trivial Pursuit’’ for
‘‘(e)onnoisseurs of trashy where-to-go-to-school manuals.”
Warning readers that they’d better attack Birnbach’s book
‘“‘armed with several shakers of salt,’’ reviewer Neal Karlen
writes that the book “‘turns out to be a poorly written, over-
generalized mess that should be banned from all high-school
guidance counselor offices.’’ We couldn’t agree more.

eAnd in the good news, bad news dept., we noted last week
that a hometown bookstore not only had shelved the book
with other college guides, such as Peterson’s and The New
York Times, but also with the humor books (that’s ‘“‘Beyond
The Far Side’’). The former obviously was a mistake, and the
latter is, at best, a generous classification.

A challenge to reclaim legacy

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

Just when educators thought that
the government was going to stop
criticizing their performance, Wil-
liam J. Bennett, chairman of that lof-
ty-sounding institution, the National
Endowment for the Humanities, re-
leases a report decrying the sharp
decline in humanities studies in U.S.
colleges and universities in the last
decade. According to Bennett, the sit-
uation has taken such a severe turn
for the worse that students graduate
‘lacking even the most rudimentary
knowledge about the foundations of
their nation and their civilization.”

Now that should come as little sur-
prise to the majority of educators
and thinkers on campuses today.

 

   

Classical studies dealing with An-
cient Greece and Rome just aren’t
what everyone wants to take. Philo-
sophy is the major for left-over ’60s
freaks. And while European history,
English, modern languages and mu-
sic may be “‘fun” courses, they really
have little to do with our everyday
lives, or so thinks today’s practical
student generation as they sign up for
yet another business course.

The trend toward ‘“‘practical’’ edu-
cations and away from the liberal
arts tradition is a serious dilemma
for educators and students alike, for
it signals two very dangerous trends
in our society.

First, it points to the short-sighted
nature of educational curriculums to-
day. Students choose business or
other pre-professional majors be-
cause that is how graduates get jobs.

 

  

To put it in the colloquial, ‘‘That is
where the jobs are.’’ Recruiters,
while singing the praises of being
able to read, write and think clearly
that come as the result of the liberal
arts education, nonetheless hire the
business student because he or she
has the better grasp of what is involv-
ed in the world called ‘‘business.”’
Recruiters, and advisers alike, need
to realize that the best education is
not always that which best prepares
a certain student to think in a certain
way, but that which best prepares
him to think.

But secondly, and most important-
ly, students today no longer are pre-
sented with the challenge early in
education to consider the precedent
for living set forth by the Homers,

of our life. We are encouraged to

For decency’s sake

To the Editors:

It was particularly disturbing to
read in The Phi (‘Will June bicenten-
nial go unobserved?” Nov. 8) that the
administration is planning to cele-
brate the 200th anniversary of the
first commencement exercises in
September. Commencement exerci-
ses honor the graduating class. The
class of 1985 will graduate in June,
not September. I realize that the
commencement ceremonies in 1785
were held in that month, but it is nec-
essary to note that this was due to the
fact that the academic year ended
then.

One is tempted to ask why the ad-
ministration would then choose to
celebrate in September? The gradu-
ates of 1985 will have been three mon-
ths absent, and mortarboards and di-
plomas will have been put away. The
reason seems to lie in the administra-
tion’s desire to have the celebrations
further fuel the media attention ac-
companying the arrival of coeds; in
short, a cheap publicity stunt.

President Wilson promised the
W&L community that the move to co-
education would be handled with pro-
per decorum and grace. Here, how-
ever, is a glaring example of disre-
gard for both. When President Wilson
was asked what quality he associated
with W&L, he responded ‘‘decency.”’
Here the administration seems more

Correction

Due to an editing error, an article
on coeducation in the Nov. 15 Ring-
tum Phi misstated the background of
Hollins College Dean of the Faculty
Wendy Fairey. Fairey was the Dean
of Students at Bowdoin College when
it began admitting women and was
the Associate Dean of the Faculty at
Barnard College at the time it was
considering closer academic ties
with Columbia University

than willing to sacrifice decency in
favor of a publicity gimmick, an ex-
tremely regrettable attitude indeed.
For decency’s sake, I urge the ad-
ministration to reconsider. Would it
not be far better to honor our gradu-
ates and our history? Only then, it
seems, can the idea of continuity bet-
ween the old and the new be express-
ed in a fair, equitable and decent
manner, The cheap and the shoddy
do not belong to W&L, neither to the
old nor the new.

Narrow attitudes
exit with women

1o the Editors:

Until I read the Nov. 1 copy of The
Ring-tum Phi, I had concurred with
my husband and his friends (Class of
’41) that indeed there is a place for
small men’s colleges, and it is a
shame that W&L has had to change
its tradition. Now, however, since I
found numerous examples of a nar-
row attitude toward minority groups,
bigotry toward women in politics,
and a ‘‘me only’’ concern, perhaps
women will give some of the compas-
sion and intellectual competition that
is needed to the males at Mr. Lee’s
University. They may even aid the
more enlightened members of the
faculty in conveying the message
that materialism and chauvinism
will not erase the very dangerous
international and national problems
that they will face. Your editorial
was excellent.

Thank you for allowing me to ex-
press these views.

MY
VIEW

By Ben Hale

 

 

A few weeks ago, Timothy Lea-
ry came and spoke to a large gath-
ering in Lee Chapel. I was on the
front row, considering myself luc-
ky to be hearing this famous con-
troversial character. Since that
night, I have been reflecting on
just why I was so lucky. I did
benefit from the Leary experi-
ence: He said some interesting
and amusing things about my gen-
eration, he emphasized the reality
of the computer age and he spark-
ed that urge in me to live, to ex-
perience, to accomplish. The
catch is that I can hear interesting
observations— can be stirred
—from almost any professor here,
in any decent seminar. The con-
clusion: We paid several thousand
dollars just to have a famous per-
son in Lee Chapel. What, then, is
the philosophy behind our speak-
ers program?

Three years ago, we paid a
great deal of money to hear attor-
ney F. Lee Bailey talk about a
cashless society — a speech any

 

 

think of great works because they are
great, and not for what makes them
great. In short, by the time we reach
college education, we are not really
prepared for the demanding choices
we must make in the curricular
realm. Planning a four-year educa-
tion is not a trivial matter, not should
it be a trivial pursuit. A proper edu-
cation involves much more than
merely taking the required and then

“easy A” classes. It involves far
more of an intellectual ‘‘meeting of
the minds”’ than that.

To a certain degree, we at Wash-
ington and Lee are exempt from
some of the charges made by Bennett
in his report. Freshmen this year will
be required to have some proficiency
in a modern language through at
least the second year, to have taken a
lab science course, to have thought
carefully about world literature, to
have delved into the thoughts of scho-
lars in the areas of history, philoso-
phy and religion and to have consid-
ered the ramifications of the social
sciences. We have a tightly-knit core
curriculum that requires students
both to consider the humanities and
to be proficient in them.

But our curriculum is unlike that of
the vast majority of American col-
leges and universities. As part of the
farcical ‘‘education reforms’’ that
came as a result of our real days of
shame in the 60s, colleges tended to
de-emphasize the required curricu-
lum, encouraging students instead to
think for themselves in deciding on
courses for study. Now, educators
have realized the mistake that was
and continues to be, as more and
more graduates enter the work force
with little knowledge of their heri-
tage. I'm certainly not encouraging
military-like requirements for to-
day’s studies, but a better guide to
college education on the behalf of ad-
ministrators and faculty alike is in
high demand today. Like the title of
Bennett’s report, higher education
has a challenge — ‘‘To Reclaim a Le-

gacy.”

senior politi.., ..unomics or soc-
iology major could have con-
structed. We also paid, in that
same year, a great deal of money
to hear Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy put on his show
(which is basically to shock peo-
ple with his crass views). I think if
Liddy or Bailey came today,
they’d get the same crowds and
support they got then. Even as I
write this, Iam unsure about what
conclusion to draw. I think this
demonstrates something about
our intellectual fervor — or our
level of genuine cyriosity.

This sounds awfully pompous,
since we all certainly like to see
and hear famous people. But it
seems that we ought to face up to
being a university. That we are
here to learn and grow ought to
have some influence on all that we
do — especially the student spon-
sored speakers forums. The show-
biz attitude we have about inviting
people to come to speak to us only
illustrates the overall lack of in-
tellectual purpose among us.

I don’t suggest that we bring in
ap obscure professor from some
Arkansas junior college. We can
and should certainly bring in sig-
nificant people — who have some-
thing to say that we need and want
to hear.

In August, the four bloodhounds,
Straining at their leashes, searched
the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, a
* poolside in Los Angeles and a beach
,in Puerto Rico, all the while asking
“‘Where’s Dee?”

In late October, having tracked
.down Dee Huddleston, the blood-
hounds chased him over fences and
‘through forests, asking why he'd
,earned $50,000 in honorariums and
had missed many votes important to
*his constituents.

, Those two campaign commercials

helped turn around a U.S. Senate
*race in Kentucky this year and give
Republican Mitch McConnell a sur-
prise victory over Walter D. ‘“‘Dee”’
Huddleston, the Democratic incum-
bent with 12 years’ experience, politi-
cal researcher V. Lance Tarrance,
Jr. said during a W&L lecture last
hight.

As he turned off the videotape
rmachine, Tarrance turned to his
{Commerce School audience and said,
“That’s all there was in this cam-
*paign, folks.”’

Tarrance, a 1963 W&L graduate
‘who is president of Tarrance & As-
*sociates, a Houston-based profession-
al research company, gave the audi-
“ence synopses of several other cam-
«paigns his firm handled this year.

Founded in 1977, Tarrance & As-
"sociates has performed survey re-

«search and public opinion analysis
for Republican candidates for politi-
‘cal offices at all levels in at least 46
«States.

In addition to working for the Mc-
*Connell campaign in Kentucky, Tar-
sTance’s firm was involved in Phil
Gramm’s victorious U.S. Senate race
“against Democrat Lloyd Doggett in

~ Texas to fill the seat left by the retir-
ing John Tower.

Tarrance displayed tracking sur-
*veys from the final month of that
_ campaign that showed Gramm with
a consistently wide lead over Doggett
yamong nearly all categories of vo-
, ters. In addition, many of these polls
indicated that Doggett had a nega-
* tive image throughout the campaign.

» “How in the world can you win if
_ you've got a negative image? It’s just
not going to happen,” Tarrance said.

When Gramm slipped slightly in
»the tracking polls about two weeks
before the election, Tarrance said,
"his campaign within 48 hours “‘stop-

bo Paes Es

ped the bleeding” by developing a
television advertisement featuring
Tower.

However, Tarrance. noted,
‘“‘There’s an old saying that if you’re
going to tune in to an NBA basketball
game, tune in to the last 15 minutes
and you'll get the whole thing. That’s
sometimes the way it is in politics.”

Such was the case in Kentucky,
where tracking polls showed Huddle-
ston ahead of McConnell through
Nov. 2, four days before the election.

‘“‘We were never in this race,’’ Tar-
rance said, but once McConnell be-
gan to close the gap, the Huddleston
campaign reacted too slowly. Again
comparing the situation to a basket-
ball game, Tarrance added that it
was the equivalent of when one team
has a big lead but toward the end of
the game commits a lot of turnovers.
Then, at the buzzer, “the other guy
shoots it from halfcourt and sinks it.
That’s about the way McConnell won
in Kentucky.”

On a national level, Tarrance said,
“the election was a big one for the
Republicans this time, but it was a
big one for the Democrats 24 months
ago.”

This does not signal any kind of
major realignment, Tarrance added.
“We tend to overplay realignment
talk. You don’t change your party
very quickly and I think you do it in
less than perfect ways.”

Despite all of the research that
goes into a campaign, though, Tar-
rance said voting ‘ is ‘‘the most com-
plex psychological decision you can
make. Think, for a minute, how
many dynamics go into that decision
... even though we try to quantify it
every day in our business, it’s an
emotional act.”

‘Bar group completes study;
‘release of report uncertain

The committee appointed by the

’ Rockbridge County-Buena Vista Bar

, Association to investigate ‘the order-

ly administration of justice in Rock-

* bridge County” has completed its

, Study.

Bar Association president J. Todd

..’ Jones said he has received the re-

, port, but declined any comment on

the document's contents or whether

it will be released to the public or the
, barassociation.

The next regular meeting of the
"bar association is scheduled for Jan.
» 14. Jones said a special meeting has
not been called.

Jones appointed the committee last
» March at the direction of the bar as-
sociation. The group ordered forma-
* tion of the five-member committee at
« the same time it adopted a resolution
containing information about the
* rights of witnesses appearing before
» the special grand jury that investi-
gated local drug trafficking earlier
* this year,
« The resolution said the committee
should consult local courts, law en-
" forcement agencies, lawyers and cit-
« izens in preparing a report and re-
commendations for the bar assovia-
* tion president.
Members of the committee have
said they received little response to a
" questionnaire that was mailed to a
» number of community officials and

.

.

 

citizens earlier this year.

Several committee members indi-
cated this week that the report may
not necessarily ever be released.

“‘T’m not aware of any plans to take
up the report in a regular bar meet-
ing,’’ Louise P. Moore said.

“I don’t think there’s been a deter-
mination’’ of whether or not the re-
port will be made public or presented
to the bar association, H. David Nat-
kin added.

Natkin said he learned from the
study ‘‘that people take a great deal
of interest in the way criminal justice
works, and a number of people want-
ed to comment about the way the
criminal justice system functions in
the community.”

“It’s in Mr. Jones’ hands right now
and I don’t know what he plans
to do with it,”’ said Washington and
Lee law professor J. Timothy Phil-
ipps. ‘“‘Our charge was to present a
report to the bar association presi-
dent. We've given it to him and now
he has to decide what todo with it.”

Philipps said the report is eight or
nine pages. He said as far as he
knows there is only the original and
one copy, both of which were deliver-
ed to Jones.

Shuler A. Kizer declined comment

on the report and Eric L. Sisler could
not be reached.

New scale may help some

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The addition of the A-plus to the Washington and Lee
University grading system actually may improve some
students’ chances of getting into the law schools of their

According to Bruce Sherman of the Law School Data
Assembly Service, which sends scaled reports of stu-
dents’ grades to law schools, the LSDAS assigns the
same number values to grades as Washington and Lee.

‘*Most schools that have the A-plus give only a 4.0,”
explained Sherman, but the LSDAS would scale this up
to a 4.33. Before the fall of 1983, W&L did not use any
pluses or minuses in its grading system, so the highest
grade any student could receive from the LSDAS was a
4.0. Students from schools which gave A-pluses could
receive 4.33s, so Sherman said it is possible that this
may have hurt some W&L students.

According to Edward O. Henneman, Associate Dean
of Law at W&L, the LSDAS sends the law schools a pac-
ket containing the student’s scaled grades, yearly and
cumulative GPA’s, a copy of the student’s transcript,
information on how the student ranks in his own school
and results from the Law School Admissions Test.

Chemistry Professor Michael A. Pleva said he believ-
ed the new system at W&L is more of the norm. A
spokesperson for the Centralized Admissions Service
(which performs a service similar to the LSDAS for stu-
dents interested in medical school) refused to comment
about their scaling system.

“‘T have always graded with pluses and minuses and
then had to translate them into whole grades,”’ said
journalism Professor Robert J. deMaria, who added
that he does not believe in the A-plus.

“In very, very, very exceptional cases...you will find
somebody who is an A-plus student,” said deMaria, but
according to results presented in the 1983-84 Registrar’s
Report, other professors think differently.

WA&L gave out 312 A-pluses during the 1983-84 school
year. The military science department gave out the
most A-pluses with 45, followed by history with 35, art
with 34 and music with 33.

Tom Withenbury, assistant director of admissions for
Sweet Briar College, said the Amherst women’s college
recently switched its highest grade from an A-plus
downtoanA.

The Sweet Briar faculty decided that an A should be
the highest grade a student could receive, Withenbury
said.

“The key to the exam period is bud-
geting your time correctly and using
your free time wisely,’’ said senior
Glen Jackson, who is the head of stu-
dent recruitment.

As a means of mental relaxation,
Jackson recommends taking an hour
off from studying to work out in the
weight room or to run.

Last Tuesday, Ted LeClercq, a
dorm counselor in Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory, held a meeting for the fresh-
men on his hall. One of the topics
discussed was the exam period.

LeClercq recommends scheduling
exams with adequate time in be
tween for preparation.

“It’s always a bad plan to take ex-
ams on consecutive days...your mind
needs a break while it’s changing
gears,”’ he said. ‘‘If you have four ex-
ams, don’t rush and leave by Wed-
nesday.”

The counselor believes that, by the
end of the examination period, a stu-
dent’s level of concentration has di-
minished significantly from the be-
ginning of the week.

WLUR-FM to feature
its own radio drama

 

By PEDRO CARROLL
Staff Reporter

 

One of the front-page headlines for
The Ring-tum Phi of March 11, 1938,
was ‘‘Prep Schools Invade Campus.”
The next day, Hitler invaded Austria.
Two Phi editions later, the front page
included ‘“Troubadours Promise Ex-
plosion When ‘Blonde Bombshell’ En-
ters’’ and ‘‘Riegel Says World War Is
Already Being Fought.”’

Two Washington and Lee sopho-
mores, Eric Knight and Mike Wacht,
have traveled back in time to that era
to produce ‘‘The Daredevils,” a 13-
episode radio drama that will be
broadcast on the student radio sta-
tion, WLUR-FM.

“It’s a mixture of Dashiell Ham-
met, Raymond Chandler, Indiana
Jones, Alfred Hitchcock and some of
the movie serials from the 1930s,”’ ex-
plained Knight, who wrote the script.

The script contains 27 characters
— 23 males and four females. Stu-
dents from Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College will perform the fe-
male roles. Auditions were held ear-
lier this month.

“This is an independent project,”’
Wacht said. ‘‘We haven’t received
any funding from any campus organ-
ization. We have had some help from
some faculty members giving us ad-

vice. The final decision, however, is
ours.”’

Richard Asher, an American ar-
cheologist, is the central character,
who is in quest of a missing sap-
phire. He journeys from England to
China during his search, which, coin-
cidentally, begins on March 12, 1938
— the day that Hitler invaded
Austria. Junior Jim Strader will play
the role.

The radio-serial style was followed
during the production of the script.
Knight, the script writer and direc-
tor, said he created dialogue that
does not ‘‘insult a person’s intellect.”

All of the stories will be self-ex-
planatory, according to Knight. He
said that no narrator will be used.
However, each episode will end in a
cliffhanger. One of the major goals of
Wacht and Knight is to have the pro-
gram sound authentic.

Knight researched and worked on
the script during the summer. He in-
terviewed people who had actually
lived during that period to obtain
realistic dialogue. Faculty reactions
to the script have been encouraging,
according to Knight.

“We'll be recording in the Cable
Nine studios,’’ Wacht said. ‘‘We’ll
have more room there for our actors
to move around,”’

Production will begin this week-
end. The first shows will be aired in
mid-January.

School’s candlelight service

Washington and Lee University’s
annual Christmas candlelight ser-
vice will be held next Thursday, Dec.
6, at 7:30 p.m. in R.E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church.

The traditional service will feature
the nine lessons and carols that cover
sacred history from the creation to
the birth of Christ.

Members of the Washington and

est one on either Saturday or Mon-
day,”’ LeClercq said.

Jackson, however, disagrees that
students should take their hardest ex-
am first for the simple reason that
most are usually working up until
Friday.

The hardest exam should be sched-
uled sometime in the middle of the
week, according to Jackson. Fresh-
men need a chance to ‘‘get used to the
experience,” he said.

“T like to take the hardest ones
first, spreading them out from Satur-
day afternoon through Friday if I
have four of them,” said Student
Body President Cole Dawson.

“T think it’s silly for people to rush
through them just so they’ll have

Lee faculty and student body will
read the lessons, and student and
community musicians will provide |
the carols. W&L senior Warren Tay-
lor will be the organist.

An offering will be collected and
donated to the community winter
clothing drive.

The service, sponsored by the
University Federation at W&L, will
be open to the public.

Exam scheduling strategies differ

more vacation, because tnen you re
so burned out that you can’t do well.”

Of course, in most cases, a student
may change a scheduled exam with
permission of his professor.

However, LeClercq believes that
the system practiced by the history
and philosophy departments should
apply to the entire University.

These departments allow students
to take their examinations on any
day at either time (on Saturday at 2
p.m.) without having pre-scheduled
them.

Jackson said he believes that such
a system might ‘‘put too much pres-
sure on the freshmen’’ and that many
would wait until the end of the week
before taking their exams.

Two new WAL scholarships
started in honor of Latture

The Rupert Nelson Latture
Scholarship has been created to re-
cognize the ‘extraordinarily long
years of devotion and service to
Washington and Lee” of Rupert N.
Latture, emeritus professor of polit-
ics.

Latture, who walks to the Alumni
House each morning to greet visitors,
will be 93 in January.

The scholarship is to be awarded
annually to a deserving student who
requires assistance to attend the
University.

Mr. and Mrs. William E. Latture of
Greensboro, N.C., have established
the endowed scholarship in honor of
William Latture’s father.

The scholarship is the second to be
established in Latture’s honor re-
cently. Earlier, the Delta Upsilon
fraternity made a gift to the universi-
ty for a scholarship honoring Lat-
ture.

“Professor Latture has _ contri-
buted in so many important ways to
Washington and Lee that it is only ap-
propriate that he be honored in a
manner that will contribute so mean-
ingfully to future generations of W&L
students,’’ President John D. Wilson
said.

William Latture has served W&L
as a director and treasurer of the

W&L Alumni Board, as a class agent
for the Class of 1949, and as president
of the Greensboro, N.C., area alumni
chapter. He is a retired director of
Blue Bell Inc. in Greensboro.

A 1915 graduate of W&L, Rupert
Latture remains active on the cam-
pus. He was formerly head of the po-
litical science department at W&L.
After his retirement from teaching in
1962, he served as special adviser to
the president.

Movie slated

The Film Society will present
“Blood Wedding,” a film from Span-
ish director Carlos Saura, on Friday
and Saturday.

The film will be shown at 8 p.m.
both evenings in Classroom A of
Lewis Hall, the W&L law school
building. There is no charge for
admission. The film is in Spanish
with English subtitles.

“Blood Wedding” is based on Fed-
erico Garcia Lorca’s play ‘“‘Bodas de
sangre.” Richard Grefe, faculty ad-
viser to the W&L Film Society, notes
that the film is ‘‘a masterful blending
of drama, dance and film, realized by
director Saura and
dancer/choreographer Antonio
Gades.”’

" University photographer W. Patrick Hinely with his award-winning

photograph.

 

By ANTHONY CORNEALIUS
Staff Reporter

 

On July 4, 1971, while at a party at
Bear Farm near Lexington, a young
rookie photographer armed with a
Nikon ventured about the area to see
what he could see. Soon the sun
began to set. Then, suddenly, he
noticed a cat jump on a fence near a
tree. He watched inquisitively as the
cat, in the light of the sun, began to
stretch and cur! its tail. Fascinated,
the young man took a few pictures of
the scene. Little did he realize that
when the photos were developed
several weeks later, his life would be
changed completely.

Thirteen years later, Patrick Hine-
ly, the rookie photographer is now
the University photographer and still
believes ‘That first moment of

Law student queries
White on his survey

 

'
By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

A survey distributed in the Law
School three weeks ago by Executive
Committee Vice President James
White was harshly questioned by a

~iaw student during Monday night’s
EC meeting.

Alice Sacks, a second-year law stu-
‘dent, said some law students were
concerned about how the results of
the survey would be used by the EC,
‘because the answers to the questions
might not be an accurate reflection of
Law School sentiment.

* The survey — which contained
questions on how law students felt
about the honor system, the new fis-
‘cal separation between the EC and
the Student Bar Association, and un-
dergraduate-run student activities
‘_was perceived in part as trying to
undermine the Law School’s vote last

ear on a referendum to make the

BA’s budget separate from that of
vindergraduate organizations, Sacks
said.

* Sacks’

.

complaint, which began

with a request that senior represen-
tative David Jonson remove his feet
from the table so she could see his
face, came about 10 minutes after
SBA President John Sicilian said that
the fiscal agreement made between
the governing bodies of the two
schools was working out, and that the
EC has been ‘‘doing a very good job.”

Sacks said that there was a possibi-
lity that the information that might
be gleaned from the survey is not
valid.

“People didn’t know if (the survey)
was serious or not,”’ Sacks said.

The reason for that, according to
Sacks, is that when questions about
the survey were brought to EC law
representatives Gordy Hammock
and James Crutchfield, neither knew
about it.

“‘We elected Gordy and James as
our reps,’’ Sacks said, ‘‘and we want
to know why they didn’t know about
ag

White said he distributed the
survey without notifying the other
EC members, but that he did it in
good faith simply to get an under-

standing of law school opinion. White
said the survey produced a high
response rate.

“After all these law school issues
came out, I just had an idea to make
a poll,’’ White explained. ‘‘I just took
it upon myself to doa questionnaire.”

“T didn’t know James was doing
it,’’ EC President Cole Dawson said,
“‘but I thought it was well done.”’

In other action, the EC voted to
freeze the Business Office funds of
Contact, the W&L Film Society, the
Ski Club and the International Club
for not presenting budget reports.

Crutchfield suggested that the
members of the student organiza-
tions receiving student body funds be
brought in and told when their budget
reports are due, since the question
was raised as to whether the organi-
zations knew when to report.

Also, senior representative Bob
Tomaso suggested that a section of
the White Book be revised to make it
clear that the confidentiality of honor
hearings applies to all students, not
just EC members. The subject was
tabled for a week.

enjoyment.”

He has also abandoned the Nikon
for a Leica, married and improved
his skills. In fact, he recently won the
Grand Prize for Jazz Photo of 1984,
sponsored by the International Jazz
Association and Jazz Forum, among
various other groups. The winning
photo of Sonny Rollins was said to
embody the meaning of jazz.

Hinely, a W&L graduate, has a
keen interest in jazz, and this interest
led him to shooting some photos for
various album covers after deciding
that the old covers he had seen were
terrible.

“TI thought I could do better than
the relatives (of the band members)
that took them...and felt...that I
could help the musician in a way,”’ he
said. Many of the photos have been
used, mostly by jazz and contempor-
ary classical groups. In regards to
his personal style and taste, Hinely
said he tries to model himself after
one of his idols, Henri Cartier-Bres-

The Rockbridge Orchestra and
Chorus will give its first concert of
the 1984-85 season Saturday at 8 p.m.
in VMI’s Jackson Memorial Hall.
The chorus and orchestra are cele-
brating their tenth anniversary sea-
son this year.

Also, the Rockbridge Youth Or-
chestra and Dance Ensemble will
perform the next day at Lexington
High School at 3 p.m.

The four groups are sponsored by
the Rockbridge Fine Arts Workshop.

The adult orchestra, directed by
Dr. Ben Wright of Harrisonburg, will
perform Beethoven’s Overture to
The Creatures of Prometheus, the
Overture to Christophe Gluck’s opera
Iphigenia in Aulis, and Sir Edward
Elgar’s “Chanson de Nuit” and
“Chanson de Matin.”

The chorus, directed by Dr. Gordon
Spice, a Washington and Lee music
professor, will then join Wright and
the orchestra and perform Franz
Schubert’s Mass in E-F lat, which the
composer completed four months be-
fore his death. Soloists will be Char-
les Bodie, Ruth Floyd, Tim Gaylard,
Bruce Herrick, Spice, Norma Stotz
and Agnes Swope.

son, Bresson is an international pho-
to-jouralist who snapped pictures of
many of the great moments in his-
tory, according to Hinely.

However, Bresson’s finest photos
came from his shots of everyday peo-
ple. ‘‘He tried to capture people in
what he called ‘The decisive moment
where people are organized in a per-
fect shape of relationships that yield
the strongest image,’ "’ Hinely ex-
plained.

Hinely strives for the technique
through his isolation of realistic, yet
surrealistic, events. He maintains
that once something so simple and
commonplace is seen by itself, it may
say something profound or make a
joke.

Another aspect of his creative sim-
plicity is his use of black and white
film. He explained that this type of
film is easy to work with and that the
use of contrasts and composition are
easier to define in the darkroom. One
problem that he does face as a

tribution of $2 per adult, $1 per stu-
dent or $5 per family to help support
the activities of the chorus and
orchestra, which also are made pos-
sible by grants from the National En-
dowment for the Arts, the Virginia
Commission for the Arts, the County
of Rockbridge and by gifts from the
United Virginia Bank and other busi-
nesses, organizations and _individ-
uals.

The Youth Orchestra, with about 25
members, is under the direction of
first-vear conductor David Driesen,

photographer, however, is catching
someone in his particular role and
the relationships of that role to
others.

“It’s like seeing each individual
element for what it is, but being able
to see them all in relationship to one
another at the right time and picce is
hard,”’ he said.

His tastes are also simple, yet
amazingly creative. His affection for
musicians, unusual art and everyday
life all fit his everyday lifestyle. “I
am satisfied just by working and en-
joying the results,’ he said. He said
he even finds childish pleasure when
just simply seeing the first print of a
good shot, and realizing that he got
what he wanted. Some of his other
goals are becoming a freelance
photographer, publishing a few
books, teaching, and taking the
perfect picture, which he feels that
he maybe on the verge of doing.

“‘T have to keep moving in order to
find it, though,”’ he said.

Hopkins

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team began its 1984-85 season
last week with two impressive vic-
tories over cross-town rival VMI and
highly touted Johns Hopkins

In the first victory over the Key-
dets the Generals won 62-51 in Cy
Twombly Pool. Outstanding perfor-
mances came from freshman Simon
Perez, who won the 100-yard and 500-
yard freestyle, and junior Tim Stan-
ford, who won the 100-yard butterfly
in 52.63, an NCAA Division III cham-
pionship qualifying time.

The second victory came last Sat-
urday, when Johns Hopkins, ranked
number four in the nation, came to
Twombly Pool for a dual meet. Until
this meet, the Generals had never
beaten Johns Hopkins. Last year’s
team lost by only a point, but this
year the Generals won . 66-47.

“Tam a little shocked by the mar-
gin of victory over Hopkins, but I
knew we had some outstanding ta-
lent,’ said Coach Page Remillard.
‘We were up for this one, and we per-
formed very well. Now I would like to
see us keep it up.”

Cagers fall to 2-2
after H-SC defeat

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team saw its record fall to 2-2
after losing 91-76 at Hampden-Syd-
ney College Tuesday night.

The Generals trailed by only five
points, 37-32, at halftime, but the blis-
tering shooting by the fast-breaking
Tigers proved to be teo much for
W&L to handle in the second half.

Hampden-Sydney connected on
65.5 percent of its field goal attempts,
including a 74.2 percentage from the
floor during the second half.

W&L was led by freshman guard
Steve Hancock’s 26 points. Hancock
continued to go on a shooting tear,
hitting 12 of 15 from the field and two
of three from the line. Hancock’s
field goal percentage for the season
stands ata red-hot 76.9 percent.

Senior co-captain Scott Shannon
added 18 points for the Generals and
guard Bill Yates chipped in 13 points.

As a team, W&L shot 47.9 percent
from the field for the game.

H-SC used a balanced scoring at-
tack against W&L, with nine players
scoring six or more points.

In earlier action, the Generals
opened their 1984-85 campaign by
capturing first place in the W&L Tip-
Off Tournament played Nov, 16-17 in
Lexington.

The Generals defeated Alfred

(N.Y.) University 74-58 in their open-
ing game Friday night. Senior guard
Lex Fitzenhagen scored 16 points
against the Saxons to lead all W&L
scorers. Shannon tallied 14 points and
sophomore Jeff Harralson added 10
toward the Generals’ effort.

In the tournament championship
game on Saturday night, the Gene-
rals turned back York (Pa.) College,
57-52. W&L led the Spartans, who had
defeated the Red Devils of Dickinson
College the night before, at the half
by a count of 27-25. The Generals pull-
ed away from York in the second half
on the strength of senior guard David
Wilkinson’s seven points and
maintained their lead thanks to the
clutch free-throw shooting of Yates
late in the game. The senior canned
eight of 10 attempts from the charity
Stripe on the evening. Yates led
General scorers with 16 points. Shan-
non added 15 points. He was also
named the tournament's Most
Valuable Player and was joined on
the All-Tournament team by Wilkin-
son.

The Generals suffered their first
loss of the season on Nov. 20 against
Salisbury State, falling to the Sea
Gulls by a 90-74 final score.

W&L trailed by 25 points, 45-20, at
halftime before fighting back to a 12-
point deficit late in the game at 84-72.

Student-athlete?

..Well, taking a cue from Phi
bossman Bruce Potter and the edi-
torial page, I, too, will take my shots
at the Olden Polynice affair. It is the
classic case to illustrate that when it
comes to NCAA Division I there is
something rotten in Denmark, bet-
ter make that Charlottesville (and
any other city that is the home of
tig-time college athletics).

Seems last spring old Olden turned in an English paper that (hor-
rors!) he didn’t happen to write (Read, unless you’re on the U.Va.
Honor Committee: Plagiarism). Our friends at The Washington Post
said last week that Terry (call me ‘‘Gutless’’) Holland, the Cavs’
hoops coach, testified in the honor (?) trial that poor Olden was receiv-
ing pressure from the team’s coaches (who are they?) that he com-
plete his work in the class.

The feeling in this corner is that athletes in high-pressure college
programs are allowed to be, more often than not, barely students.
Granted, this may be an isolated slip in the academic career of Mr.
Polynice. His grades may be well above standard, but his academic
standing is not at issue here. What is, is the fact that (and we’ll have to
assume the truth here) coaches were putting pressure on a student-
athlete to meet minimum course requirements.

A recent study by the NCAA of freshmen athletes at Division I
schools shows that they “‘perform as well in the classroom as
freshman nonathletes with comparable academic backgrounds,”’ ac-
cording to The NCAA News. The News also notes however that ‘‘the
study did not compare the types of courses taken by the athletes and
nonathletes.’’ The problem? The pressures of big-time college
athletics has reached a point where coaches are more or less forced to
produce results at whatever the cost. One need only look at Florida’s
problems earlier this year to see that wins and losses have reached
such a high place that an athlete as a student has become a secondary
thought.

These very talented individuals are viewed in terms of their four
years at the school as opposed to their 40 years outside of the school in
too many cases. Olden Polynice is part of this epidemic in an in-
teresting way. Because he and others like him are viewed as usable
objects in so many instances, it is conceivable that their self image is
one that allows them to forget about their responsibilities. As well, too
often they are allowed to get by as athletes oniy. Look at all the “hard-
ship” cases in recent years.

The big-time college athlete has come to see himself as a
marketable athlete too often. And the responsibility for that unfor-
tunate state of affairs, my friends, lies with coaches. And, Terry
Holland, that means more than a mandate to your players to get their
work done. It means a genuine and maintained interest in what your
players are doing outside of the team. Dean Smith’s move in couseling
Michael Jordan to forego his final college season to make his living in
the pros was sensible on one hand but short-sighted on the other.
Michael has 30 or 40 years to amuse himself after basketball that his
dribbling skills may not be able to help him with.

What I keep coming back to is the thought that are these big-time
college athletes taking up spots in their schools that real students are
being denied? If the four years of eligibility that a college athlete has
are for no other purpose than to prime him for a professional career
that in an overwhelming majority of the cases will never occur, then
there is something seriously wrong with NCAA Division I athletics. It
is unfortunate, but if today’s trends continue, ‘‘athletic scholarship”
will be nothing but a contradiction in terms....

_...Back from Turkey Break and on to some Colonnade notes: A look
at the General cagers shows a plus sign after the W&L Tip-Off Tourna-
ment and a question mark after the loss to Salisbury State. Tuesday
night’s loss to the Squids is a cause for concern. These two weeks after
Thanksgiving can be more trouble than they’re worth. Let’s hope the
team can go into exams on the up side...Tip of the cap and a wish for
continued brilliance to the General swimmers after their strong upset
of Johns Hopkins. Page Remillard has some fine freshmen to add to
his regular crew of Tim Stanford, Bobby Pearson and Jay Re-
ville...Some good wrestling is on tap Saturday in the Warner Center as
the Generals will host the eight-team W&L Invitational. Here’s a guess
that a majority of the noteworthy performances at the meet will come
from the home team....

....Can’t avoid it any longer. The first question asked, with few ex-
ceptions, after ‘‘How was your break?” was “Did You See The
Game?” Yes, I did, and it was certainly the most brilliant passing per-
formance by a pair of college quarterbacks that we will ever see. A
couple of things: 1) Doug Flutie showed any NFL scouts who weren’t
sure of his arm strength that, when needed, ‘“‘Mr. Excitement” (not
Paul Foutch, a common misconception) can crank it up. 2) The show
was made even more amazing by the fact, if you’ll remember, that it
rained for much of the second half. 3) There were some complaints
about the lack of defense, but it may be safe to assume that with Kosar
and Flutie at the reins, seven defensive backs are not enough...

.... Finally, here’s one from the unsuccessful rule change dept.: That
NCAA “‘out of the end zone, out to the 30’’ kickoff rule has resulted in
one kickoff being placed on the 30 every two games. Nice rule change,
guys...

Grapplers tame Tigers

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team opened its 1984-85 dual match
schedule Tuesday night with a 38-15
victory over the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney in Farmville

Although the Generals (1-0) easily
defeated the Tigers, head coach Gary
Franke said, ‘I don’t think that we
wrestled very well.”’

Franke cited freshman Greg Rus-
sell for his victory at 158 lbs. as being
an exception. He said that Russell did
a ‘‘great job’ and was ‘‘most impres-
sive ‘

Russell’s classmate, Steve Castle,
started things off on a positive note
for the Generals with an opening bout
win at 118 lbs. Juniors Brian Lifsted
(126 Ibs.), Larry Anker (142 Ibs.) and
Win Phillips (167 lbs.), and seniors
Joe O’Neill (177 lbs.) and newcomer
heavyweight Mark Weaver also re-
corded wins for W&L Tuesday night.

These times are a reflection of the
“hard work and long practices the
, team members have had as regular
fare already this year.
‘“‘The excitement over this victory
» is because of our respect for their
(Hopkins’) program,’’ Coach Remil-
" lard said.

Last year the Generals finished 6-4
and number 15 out of 75 teams in the
nation. They also had six All Amer-
icans and set six new school records.
After the Hopkins victory it is becom-
ing apparent that this year’s team is
as tough if not tougher than last
year’s team according to Remillard.

“‘We lost two All Americans, Tim
Rock and Gary Myers but Stanford is
beating Myers’ times and freshman
Eric Sullivan is faster than Rock.”’
said Remillard. ‘Sullivan could
rewrite the record book in the middle
distance events. All in all, the team

“The team is looking good, we’re a
lot more balanced this year.’’ said
team co-captain Bobby Pearson.
“The Hopkins victory felt great,
we've been getting closer every year.
In the middle of the meet, the team
had a good feeling about winning, but
I never dreamed of winning by 19
points.”” Pearson continued by say-
ing, “I think we could finish in the top
10 teams in the nation this year.”’

er after the first four games, tossed
in 18 points in the losing cause, while
the frosh phenom Hancock had 16
points.

Head coach Verne Canfield be-
lieves that his team will have to play
its own style of game rather than that
of its opponents if it is to get back on
the winning track.

“The last two games we've run into
very hot teams. We have a few pro-
blems we have to work out, but we
will,” Canfield said. ‘We have play-
ed out of our style in the last two
games.”

Canfield said that the high number
of points scored against his team in
its last two games is a source of con-
cern.

“There is a great deal of concern
because we take a great deal of pride
in our defense,’’ Canfield said.

Canfield said that the scoring of
Hancock has not come as a surpris¢
“We knew that he was a good

scorer,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘He obvious
ly has a nose for scoring. He has a
long way to go to show what he can
do. He has given us a scoring punch:
off the bench sofar.”’

The Generals host the University of
North Carolina-Greensboro tonight
at 7:30 p.m. Canfield expects the
Spartans to be a tough opponent.

“They have several quick leapers
and have good individual talent,’

Hunting fatalities are preventable, experts say

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Samuel P. Callahan, an 18-year-old from
Cocoa, Fla., went hunting in a densely wooded
area of northern Rockbridge County on the
Tuesday of Thanksgiving vacation.

Before the day was over, he had been charg-
ed with reckless use of a firearm.

Pronounced dead of a .30-caliber rifle wound
to the back of the neck was Tracy Curtis Bree-
den, 22, of Staunton.

Callahan reported the accident to authori-
ties. Breeden died at the scene.

Reached at his Florida home last night,
Callahan declined to discuss the incident.

Breeden’s was the second hunting death in
Rockbridge County this month, and seven hun-
ters have died in the state since July 1, already
exceeding the total from the previous hunting
year

Robert W. Day of the Rockbridge County
Sheriff's Department said the two Rockbridge
County deaths occurred because the victims
were mistaken for game. ‘‘Both of those guys
have been shot for turkeys,”’ he said.

Day said that Callahan talked to Breeden an
hour and 20 minutes before the accident. ‘‘He
knew he was in the area and he knew he was
dressed in full camouflage,”’ he said.

He said hunters are generally charged with
recklessness in cases of fatality because for a
manslaughter conviction ‘‘you've got to prove
a motive and you just can’t doit.”’

‘It's kind of a weak spot in the law, really,”’
Day said. ‘We'd like to see a felony statute for
when someone's life is taken just through gross

negligence.”

He said one factor that contributes to acci-
dents is that the Rockbridge area gets a num-
ber of hunters from out of state, which results
in crowded forest conditions. “You have
hunters come from all over,’’ he said

Washington and Lee junior Townes Pressler,
who hunts in Texas, said the large number of
hunters is one of the reasons he seldom hunts in
Rockbridge County. ‘I wouldn't dare go into
the woods here with the stories I've heard,’’ he
said.

Senior Charles Davidson of Houston has been
hunting for 10 years and has shot a deer and
several doves this season in Rockbridge Coun-
ty, which he called ‘‘one of the best deer hun-
ting areas inthestate.”

“The big problem is that there are so many
people out there in such a short time that they
go to all extremes and aren’t as careful as they
should be,’”’ he said.

“A lot of people here are out going crazy.
‘They'll shoot at any sound they hear — they
don’t wait tosee whatitis.”

Hunter G. McCoy, the Virginia Commission
of Game and Inland Fisheries’ hunter educa-
tion coordinator for Rockbridge County and a
member of the W&L printing shop staff, said
both of this year’s hunting fatalities could have
been prevented if proper safety precautions

had been followed.
According to McCoy, the two were the first

local hunting fatalities in several years.

He said that in many cases hunters shoot
when they hear a noise without seeing what
they are shooting.

McCoy also said that neither victim was
wearing ‘‘blaze orange’’ —the fluorescent color

recommended for use by hunters. He said that
in the first death, the victim was wearing cam-
ouflage and that in the second one, the person
was not wearing orange.

He said that blaze orange is the only color not
known to exist in nature and that scientists be-
lieve it to be the most visible color in existence
—even people who are color blind can see it.

‘When you go hunting, the three colors you
never wear are red white and blue,”’ he said.
“It may sound unpatriotic, but deer are red,
the turkey body has a blue tint to it and deer
have a white tail.”’

McCoy said he would favor a law mandating
use of the color by hunters. ‘‘The legislature
hasn’t seen fit to pass such a law, but I think
they should,”’ he said. |

Beverly C. ‘““John’’ Read, Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Lexington and Rockbridge Coun-
ty, agreed that additional hunting legislation
may be necessary. Like Day, Read favors mak-
ing a stiffer penalty available for those who kill
someone while hunting.

“It’s a terrible tragedy when something like
that happens, but I believe that in order to
make hunters more careful, there needs to be a
more stringent punishment associated with a
death in the woods,”’ Read said.

He said that when there is a hunting fatality,
law enforcement officials must choose between
charging the person with reckless handling of a
firearm and the much harsher charge of man-
slaughter.

“Tf you look at those two statutes, there is a
big void between them,’’ Read said. ‘‘In my o-
pinion, the General Assembly needs to change
the law in that regard.”’

“There needs to be a statute that carries with

it a stringent punishment for reckless handling
of a firearm when it results in the death of
someone, rather than the slap on the wrist that
takes place now,” he said.

Manslaughter — murder that is accidental or
not premeditated — is a class five felony pun-
ishable by imprisonment for one to ten years, a
fine of up to $1,000 or both.

Reckless handling of firearms is a class two
misdemeanor and carries a penalty of up to six
months in jail, a fine of as much as $500 or both.

Read said that he used to hunt before his mili-
tary service. “I haven’t picked up a firearm
since Vietnam,” he said solemnly,

S. Vance Wilkins Jr., Lexington’s representa-
tive in the Virginia House of Delegates, said he
also favors tough punishment for people re-
sponsible for hunting fatalities, but that ex-
isting laws may be sufficient.

“Pm not sure a manslaughter charge is total-
ly inappropriate,”’ he said of hunting fatality
cases,

“If you're shooting at something and you
don’t know what it is, that’s just about as dan-
Serous as driving a car drunk,”’ he said. ‘‘I’ve
been hunting for 40 years and I haven't seen a
man that looked like a turkey yet.”

Wilkins said that mandating fluorescent
orange clothing for hunters may not be effec-
tive.

“T’m not sure it’s the panacea people think it
is,” he said. “If the fluorescent is behind some
leaves, and you just shoot at movement, which
is all these people are shooting at anyway, the
orange isn’t going to save the person.”’

Wilkins said he doesn’t wear orange when
he’s in the woods because he has no special
hunting clothes and just wears an old jacket.

 

 

 

The MDA Superdance, Feb. 1-3, promises a lot of excitement.

Superdance sets goal at $30,000

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter
The three weeks’ between

Thanksgiving and Christmas vaca-
tion is the most important time for
recruiting Superdancers for ‘‘W&L’s
longest party,”’ according to Super-
dance Chairman Chris Williams, a
senior.

“Things are going great so far this
year. Everybody has done a super
job,”’ Williams said.

The Superdance is a 30-hour dance
marathon to benefit the Muscular
Dystrophy Association and will be
held the weekend of Feb. 1-3, 1985.
Although it had modest beginnings in
1979, W&L since has become the
number one per capita contributor to
MDA in the nation.

Last year, more than $35,000 was
pledged at the winter gala. W&L has
increased its amount pledged and
surpassed its goal every year since
the dance’s inception. ‘‘This year’s
goal is $30,000, and student participa-
tion is essential if we are to secure
this amount,” Williams explained.

In order to dance, a student should
pick up a packet Sunday night at

Room 114 in the Student Center or ob-
tain one from Carole Chappell’s of-
fice. The person who collects the
most pledges will receive the grand
prize: an all-expenses paid trip to
Bermuda. Other prizes include week-
end trips to New York, Hilton Head
and Georgetown. Those not dancing
can win prizes in the pre-dance raf-
fle. The winner of the raffle receives
two nights for two at Snowshoe or
Virginia Beach.

While the prizes and partying are
great, Williams said, it is important
to remember the cause. Muscular
dystrophy cripples people of all ages,
but especially young children.

“Thirty hours seems like a long
time to be on your feet dancing, but
when we see those kids and the pain
that they go through, the Superdance
becomes a truly rewarding. and
satisfying experience,’ Williams
said.

Students who do not dance still are
encouraged to attend the event,
which will last from 8 p.m. Friday,
Feb, 1, to2.a.m. Sunday, Feb. 3. For
the first time, the dance will be held
in the student activities pavilion
rather than in Evans Dining Hall.

It is important for the dancers to be
encouraged by a large crowd, Wil-
liams said, and gate receipts and
beverage sales account for some
large revenues. In addition, specta-
tors can enjoy the music of the Vol-
tage Brothers, the Cruis-o-matics,
the Waller Family and Dirty Secrets,
as well as participate in some of the
special events, including the pie
throws.

Students from all of the area wo-
men’s colleges and from VMI also
will be participating in the dance.
Williams said he hopes the W&L stu-
dents will encourage women from the
surrounding colleges to make a spec-
ial effort to dance this year.

Assisting Williams are vice-chair-
man Darby Brower, David Sizemore
and Charles Stern, as well as a 75-
member steering committee. The
group has gotten off to its earliest
start ever this year,but Williams said
the real key is getting people to
dance.

“This year’s Superdance is going
to be the biggest and best ever. Itis a
great way not only to have a good

time, but to give to others who are
less fortunate than ourselves.”

McCoy’s 10
guidelines for
happy hunting

Hunter G. McCoy, hunter educa-
tion coordinator for Rockbridge
County and a W&L staff member,
said an important rule for hunting is
to wear fluorescent or ‘‘blaze’’
orange at all times. In addition, he of-
fered the ‘Ten Commandments of
Gun Safety” taught in Lexington and
Rockbridge schools:

eTreat every gun as if it were load-
ed, at all times.

eAlways point the muzzle in a safe
direction.

eUniload guns when not in use.

¢Be sure the barrel is clear of ob-
structions.

Be sure of your target.

eNever point a gun at anything you
do not want to shoot.

eNever climb a tree or cross a
fence or jump a ditch with a loaded
gun.

eNever shoot at a flat, hard surface
or the surface of water.

eStore guns and ammunition sepa-
rately.

¢Do not drink and hunt.

_|Student play deals with

blacks and segregation

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

“‘Purlie Victorious,’’ a play dealing
with black segregation, will begin
Saturday at the school’s Troubadour
Theatre and continue through Mon-
day.

W&L faculty, staff and students
will be admitted free of charge to the
production, which begins each night
at 8 p.m. Reservations are necess-
ary, and may be made by calling
463-8637 between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.

“Purlie Victorious”’ was written by
black playwright Ossie Davis in the
early 1960s.

“The play is a comedy and at-
tempts to deal with the segregation
issue ina practical and realistic way,
as opposed to other attempts that
were more radical and rebellious,’’
said student director Terry McWhor-
ter.

“Many of the plays of that era
—the civil rights peaking period
—dealt with segregation in an ag-
gressive manner, trying to force
‘Black Power’ on the audience,’ Mc-
Whorter continued.

“Davis has found great success
with this play because he steers away
from that particular attitude and de-
livers a message through the use of
humor that is more easily received.”

Debate team
wins trophies

Several members of the Washing-
ton and Lee Debate Team won tro-
phies in the recent James Madison
University Debate Tournament.

Competing in a field of 24 schools
from six states, freshman Mike Her-
rin was the winner of the eighth no-
vice speaker trophy.

Herrin and John Starks, also a
freshman, advanced through the
elimination rounds to the final round
and captured the second place novice
team trophy.

Sophomore Rick Graves and junior
Chris Lion were awarded a junior
varsity quarterfinalist trophy.

The debaters competed in eight
preliminary rounds on this year’s
national debate topic of outer space
development.

major who is taking an independent
study course in theatre, said the play
is the first black play — ‘‘performed
by, for, about and near blacks’’ — at
W&L.

“The play teaches a serious lesson
about race relations and human na-
ture by exploiting comic elements
that seem on the surface unrelated to
real life,’’ McWhorter said.

“However, it is the underlying con-
notations that deliver Davis’ real
message.”

Posters promoting the play show a
likeness of General Robert E. Lee
holding a whip and standing next toa
much taller black man who is smiling
with his mouth open and both hands
in the air with two fingers raised.

“Rebellious acts, violence or force
are not a part of this play,” McWhor-

ter said. ‘It is simply a play that
delivers a message of how such a
complex issue can be dealt with ina
realistic and practical manner.

“It is humorous and entertaining
for all, and was actually written for
white audiences.”

The cast consists of a group of W&L
students, two Sweet Briar College
students and a Lexington High School
student.

The lead role of Purlie Victorious
Judson is played by sophomore Mike
Webb. Playing opposite him is Kelly
Reed of Sweet Briar.

Other cast members include senior
Todd Jones as Ol’ Cap’n Cotichipee,
senior Bryan Johnson as Gitlow Jud-
son, and Sweet Briar’s Valerie Bran-
don as Missy Judson.

Politics fest to show ‘Reds’

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

The Politics Film Festival will con-
tinue next term to offer a wide range
of high quality films, including the
movie ‘‘Reds,’’ according to series
director and po‘itics Professor Craig
W. McCaughrin.

The tentative lineup for the winter
also includes ‘“‘High Noon,”’ ‘Advise
and Consent,”’ ‘Macbeth,’ George
Lucas’ ‘“THX-1138”’ and an Italian
film, ‘‘The Organizer.”’

The festival, which offers the films
free to students and the community,
was begun in 1982 by McCaughrin
and continued with the assistance of
politics Professor William Buchanan
and the University Library’s audio-
visual department.

McCaughrin said the films in-
crease interest in politics among
students and also demonstrate the
universality of politics.

Science fiction, Shakespeare and
even ‘‘My Fair Lady’’ can illustrate
political systems and theories and
can call attention to the widespread
influence of politics on our culture.

McCaughrin said the series is also
a means of elaborating on Politics
101, ‘Comparative Government,’
and serves as an additional text for
the class.

For example, he said, the idea of
consensus is examined in textbooks
for the courses, and the film version
of Henrik Ibsen’s ‘‘An Enemy of the
People’”’ illustrated the dangers of too
great a consensus.

McCaughrin said the ‘‘Film Fest’’
has been a mixed success. He said
that when popular films such as “A
Clockwork Orange” and ‘‘Apocaly-
pse Now” are shown, the interest in
the film itself tends to blur the politi-
cal message. On the other hand, he
noted that some of the older films fail
to hold students’ attention.

McCaughrin said he would like to
see an expansion of the Film Festi-
val, especially the role played by the
library’s audio-visual center. He said
that rather than it serving simply as
a clearing house for the films, he
would like to see the center play an
active role in classroom instruction
and campus activity.
