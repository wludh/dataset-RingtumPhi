The combination of a squeeze on revenues and an in-
crease in demands for funding is forcing a reassessment
of the University’s priorities, administrators say.

A number of popular but costly programs and pro-
cedures that have become accepted as permanent parts
of the institution are being examined and may be reduc-
ed, according to administrators.

The purpose, they say, is twofold: Such management
will help to slow- the increase in the cost 6f a Washington
and Lee education, and will also allow resources to be
shifted to areas of greater priority.

Students have initially resisted even discussion of
these possible cutbacks. Administrators respond that
they want to do nothing to diminish the quality of student
life, and hope students will recognize the value of the
self-scrutiny by the school.

Possible Cutbacks: University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley said the school is searching for ‘‘niceties, luxur-
ies, amenities that aren’t essential to the faculty teach-
ing the students.”’

Two areas that are being studied for possible reduc-
tion have been announced publicly:

¢The University Library could save as much as $24,000
in electricity alone by closing overnight rather than
maintaining its 24-hour schedule, officials have deter-
mined.

eThe Executive Committee was told Monday night
that $5,000 a year could be saved by shifting the annual
Catalogue to a biennial publication schedule.

Three additional areas of attention were identified this
week:

eEpley said energy savings could result from closing
the Colonnade classroom buildings at night.

eHe added that similar economies could be achieved
by reducing the heurs or services available in the War-
ner Center gymnasium.

Sophomore Andrew Caruthers edg-
ed junior Michael Black by 23 votes
to win the Executive Committee vice
presidential election Monday.

Juniors Lee Hollis and John Lewis
qualified for today’s runoff for presi-
dent, and second-year law student
Bill Cooper and sophomore Michael
Webb made the runoff for secretary.
Runoff results’ were expected to be
posted outside the EC room early this
evening.

Monday's balloting attracted 1,034
voters, or just more than 60 percent
of the student body.

Caruthers captured 482 votes, or
51.2 percent of those cast for either
candidate, to Black’s 459 votes, or
48.8 percent.

Caruthers’ margin of victory came
from the Law School, which he won

Black

 

¢Dean of the College John W. Elrod said his depart-
ment heads are cooperating with a request to economize
on increases in their supplies and equipment budgets.

Development Director Farris P. Hotchkiss said that
was a logical area of consideration. ‘‘Where [a spending
reduction] has an impact is that if the school is placing
priorities in the human area — as it should — the only
place it can take its toll is in just not allowing the pro-
gress we might want in the supplies and equipment
category,’’ he said.

Epley declined to specify other programs being stu-
died. ‘‘I have some ideas, but I'd prefer not to go on,”’ he
said. “Invariably, sooner or later you get into eliminat-
ing positions.”’

“TI can’t see this university calling someone in and
saying, ‘You're fired,’ ’’ he continued. ‘““But what we
might do is eliminate positions by attrition. As people
quit or retire, they would not be replaced.”

Administration Explanation: Administrators maintain
that no decisions have yet been made — that the
University is simply investigating potential economy
measures, and will later determine which of the options
it should pursue.

Elrod said an investigation may show, for example,
that the present library and Catalogue operating pro-
cedures are cost-effective and should be continued.

“I’m just raising the question,’’ he said. ‘‘We need to
do an investigation before we can make a decision. We
need some hard, cold facts to talk about.”

He added that he is simply looking to the budget ‘with
a view to reallocating money if it should be reallocated.”

University President John D. Wilson said it is critical
that the University ‘‘put the greatest emphasis on those
things that most need to be done.”’

“I frankly don’t feel I could begin to pretend to be do-
ing my job if I didn’t identify the things that count
most,” he said. ‘‘That’s all part of running an effective
institution — to ask the questions.”’

by nearly a 2-1 margin, 107-57. He
also won the votes cast in the Davis

Lexington leaders,
SABU form group

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

A group of black community
leaders met this month with mem-
bers of Washington and Lee’s Student
Association for Black Unity in an at-
tempt to improve the relationship be-
tween the two groups.

Dr. A.W. Pleasants Jr, a Lexington
physician, organized the meeting
after reading a newspaper article
about blacks at W&L that said black
students feel isolated from the rest of
the school and from the community.

‘T felt maybe the community pro-
bably had some responsibility to
those fellows,’’ Pleasants said.

The meeting was held March 4 at
Pleasants’ house.

City Council member A.C. Jordan,
Lexington School Board Chairman
Hughey Johnson and the assistant
principal of Lexington High School
George Warren, were among the
community representatives

‘The purpose of the organization is
to bring together W&L’s community
with the community at large, espec-

ially the biack community,’ said
William Rhinehart, secretary of-
SABU and one of the five W&L stu-
dents at the meeting.

“I saw Dr. Pleasants on the street
one day, and we decided to call a
meeting,’ he added

The problem of isolation was ad-
dressed at the meeting, Pleasants
said, but no decision was made on
what action to take.

‘“‘We may have another meeting
with them, or we may have some
type of social gathering,’’ he added.
“Tt may include the black cadets” at
Virginia Military Institute

What ‘‘disturbed’’ him about the
newspaper article, he said, was that
students said they had no contact
with black leaders in Lexington. That
could lead to their not having enough
role models, he said

He said the organization would do
‘whatever those fellows think the
black community could do to make
them feel better about this town.”’

Rhinehart said the students might
work with the Big Brothers program
in town. Another meeting might be
held this week, hesaid

“I figured it would be a close one,”
Caruthers said of the race between
him and Black, a junior representa-
tive to the EC. Both are from Shreve-
port, La.

Focus on belt-tightening
includes the Catalogue

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

A special ad hoc committee headed
by Professor H. Marshall Jarrett has
been created to study the possibility
of printing the University Catalogue
every other year rather than every
year, a move that could save an esti-
mated $5,000 a year.

Junior Bart Smith, the student re-
presentative to this committee, pre-
sented the proposal to the Executive
Committee Monday night.

“Some hate it, some don’t care, but
there has been no overwhelming re-
sponse in favor of the proposal,”
Smith said.

The proposal was originally
brought up by Dean of the College
John W. Elrod, who suggested a com-
mittee be set up to look into the possi-
bility of a biennial catalog. In addi-
tion, the committee is weighing
methods of simplifying the catalog.

Part of this scaling-down would in-
clude eliminating out-of-date faculty
listings, the student register, and
class period listing. At least 10 per-
cent of the period listings are chang-
ed before the term starts, Smith said.

However, most of the students feel

Law School
gets third rep

by 3-1 margin

From Staff Reports

 

 

A third Law School representative
will be added to the Executive Com-
mittee in the fall, bringing the total
EC membership to 13.

The additional representative
came about as a result of a positive
vote by students this week on a
referendum to amend the student bo-
dy constitution. Of the 942 students
voting on the referendum, 704, or 74.7
percent, supported it.

This was 76 votes more than the re-
quired two-thirds minimum for the
referendum to pass.

Also, at least half of the student
body had to vote on the referendum
for it to pass. The 942 votes represent-
ed 56.4 percent of the student body.

As expected, the Law School gave
overwhelming support to the amend-
ment. Of the 244 law students voting,
only four, or 1.6 percent, opposed it.

The amendment received about a
2-1 nod of approval on _ the
undergraduate campus.

The new EC member will repre-
sent the second-year law class, which
previously shared a representative
with the third-year law class.

Count that one down

the catalog is an integral part of pro-
spective students’ primary impres-
sion of the students and the campus,
Smith said.

Registrar Harold S. Head said, ‘‘I
see advantages and disadvantages.”

The obvious advantage, according
to Head, would be the savings. How-
ever, Head stressed that a scaled-
down, biennial catalog would not be
an effective recruiting tool.

‘As far as cutting down on faculty
workload, it seems that the faculty
would have to do a schedule any-
way,” Head said. “Besides, every
student gets a catalog when it comes
out, but most of them will lose it
within a year. I think students and
faculty use the catalog a great deal.”’

Jarrett said it would be premature
to indicate whether the plan will be
approved. ‘We are still getting input
from the alumni, the faculty, and the
students,” he added. ‘‘We haven't
gone over the information yet. We
may decide to do nothing.”

Senior EC representative David
Jonson said Monday that the student
register should not be removed.

“I remember when | was planning
to go to Washington and Lee, I was in-
terested in who was going to the
school from my area,” he said.

 

Readers’

returns to Phi

The Ring-tum Phi this week
reintroduces the Readers’ Advo
cate, a column in which the ac
tions and policies of The Ring-tum
Phi will be evaluated by senior
journalism major Peter Wright.

“The Readers’ Advocate is a
two way street: It’s to educate us
about what we're doing wrong,
and to educate our readers about
why we do what we do,” the Phi
editors said.

*‘Subjecting ourselves to outside
scrutiny is a visible way of show
ing that we're interested in being
fair.”

Wright has complete editoria!
control of the column. The editors
make no substantive changes in
the column, and Wright approves
the final typeset version.

A post office box has been re
tained for the exclusive use of the
Readers’ Advocate. Wright may
be reached at P.O. Box 265, Lex-
ington, VA 24450.

OPINION March 14, 1985

 

 

No bargain

‘““‘Money’s tight!’’ the English muffin commercial says.
How true that is, and perhaps nowhere is it more applicable
than here at Washington and Lee.

In recent months, we have seen many money-saving ideas
come from the Treasurer’s office or the President’s office.
Almost without exception, the ideas have been sharply criti-
cized. Tempers have flared, and students have accused the
administration of being unscrupulous in trying to find the
golden fleece.

Attempts to save money by turning off lights along the Col-
onnade or in the Warner Center at night or by curbing the
library’s 24-hour schedule have met with stiff resistance
from all sides. Now comes another silly idea to save dollars.

Consider the University Catalogue issue. Dean John W. EI-
rod, surveying his budget, noticed that almost $5,000 could be
saved each year if the University published the catalog every
other year rather than every year. Part of this plan would re-
quire the dropping of the class schedules from the catalog.
Faculty, currently listed twice in the catalog, would be
restricted to seeing their name in print only once. The listing
of present students and recent graduates would be elimi-
nated as well in an attempt to cut back on the size of the cata-
log. All this, we are told would be of tremendous aid to the
University’s bank account.

Somehow, the logic behind such a proposal eludes us. The
administration says such a move would conserve valuable
faculty time since they would not have to worry about filling
in registrar forms for the new catalog every fall. Yet, when
students come knocking on faculty doors during registration
week without knowing when or if the class they desire meets
the following term, time would be ill-spent searching for such
information. Students who might wish to plan ahead would be
discouraged from doing so since no definite class hours would
be listed. Currently, because less than 10 percent of the class
hours change between the time of the catalog publication and
the registration week, such a move seems dubiously helpful.
Even the need for early publication of the master schedules
(those infamous green and yellow and pink sheets stuffed in
faculty mailboxes the week preceding registration) would
amount toa substantial cost for the University.

While the program seems well intended and indeed might
save some money, is it worth the resulting confusion and ad-
ditional work on everyone’s behalf?

Along with the foolhardy proposal to close the library at
night to save the costs of lighting the five levels (while we
decide to plant lampposts around the campus to better il-
luminate the walkways) and other inevitable future attempts
at fiscal conservatism, the catalog proposal deserves rapid
appraisal and even more rapid rejection.

The solution to our financial woes does not necesarily lie in
trimming alone. Under the guidance of a president gifted
with the ability to raise funds, the University saw rapid
growth between 1968 and 1982. Buildings were constructed
and renovated with President Huntley at the helm. The infu-
sion of nearly $70 million helped the University tremendous-
ly. Today, a similar campaign for the preservation of educa-
tional standards and programs unique to a school our size
would aid our fiscal woes. With the need for additional facul-
ty members for the romance languages and for renovations
to buildings in preparation for the women next fall, money
will be hard to come by. A new drive for capital might hold
the answer for our looming financial hard times.

In our zeal to trim and cut, we must also be sensible and
use that most obvious (and yet seemingly ever absent) of in-
tuitions — common sense. As students, we need to listen care-
fully to the proposals set before us. As students, we need to
suggest alternatives where we disagree. There is indeed
room to save, but finding the room might mean we have to
squeeze a bit tighter together.

Correction

 

An Editors’ Note that preceded a
Letter to the Editor by Steven Pock-
rass in last week’s Ring-tum Phi con-
tained a reference to Pockrass’ em-
ployment history with the news-
paper. Journalism Professor Clark
Mollenhoff says the sentence was ‘“‘a
cheap shot.” We agree, and would
like to set the record straight.

We decided that stating Pockrass
had been ‘dismissed from the staff
for cause’’ would be less damaging to
Pockrass than going into a litany of
reasons that had been made clear to
him and that were none of anyone
else’s business.

Mollenhoff feels it was a poor deci-
sion. ‘Either be specific or keep your
mouth shut,”’ he said. The latter op-
tion would have been the preferrable
one.

We felt that simply stating a fact
was more fair than going into an area
that was a matter of opinion. That

was a bad call — the fact was better
left unstated.

We also wish to clarify the se-
quence of events involving the letter.
The letter was submitted before the
relationship was terminated. The let-
ter did not cause his dismissal, but
did precede it chronoligically.

The decision to fire Pockrass was
based on a disagreement over his
performance and not on his charac-
ter. Mollenhoff said the note last
week might have given the impress-
ion that Pockrass was engaged in ac-
tivity that was ‘“‘unethical or repre-
hensible.’’ He was not. Any implica-
tion to that effect was in error. The
editors apologize.

Political machine gears up

 

MY VIEW

By Mike

 

 

 

McAlevey

 

It’s that time again, the innocent
sobriety of Fancy Dress is interrupt-
ed by the tumultuous uproar of the
American political machine kicking
into gear. Garish banners flutter in
the breeze, the sheer multiplicity of
which transforms W&L into a low
rent slum where a quarter is far too
much to waste on drying linens.
Small 8-by-11 parchments cluster
near main thoroughfares so dense
that all are rendered indistinguish-
able and consequently ineffectual.
For a select handful of aspiring yup-
pies, time pauses and dreams are
fulfilled and shattered, yet for most
of us it’s just pomp, it’s cir-
cumstance, it’s Americana at its
finest, it’s EC elections.

Why, it was just today that I asked
a young, indigent, dirty-faced kid
with a baseball cap on what he want-
ed to be. You know what that young-
ster said? ‘I want to be the supreme
master of time, space and dimension
and then run for W&L student body
president.’’ Damned if I wasn’t
shocked. Tears pumped rythmically
down my cheeks as a distant ‘‘Hail to
the Chief’’ sounded, so blurry was my
vision that I could hardly see the
boy’s smiling face as I issued him
$100 and pushed him into Alvin-
Dennis, where all future EC mem-
bers start their wardrobe. Can't look
shabby, you know; after all it’s the
way you dress, not the way you think,
that gets you elected.

The boy grew inquisitive as to the
nature of elections, so I ushered him
up to the Hill and we jointly inquired.
‘“‘Why do so many people seemingly
plot out a course across this campus
avoiding the polls?’”’ he asked. I

guess his infantile mind just couldn't
comprehend all the good reasons
mine could. Like No. 1, that no stu-
dent of prudence and high stature
would put his name on a list support-
ing something as radical as a second-
year law rep. ‘What's a rep?”’ asked
my partner. ‘‘Oh, it’s like what your
sister has around town,” I said. I fur-
ther showed him how illegible most
of the 10 signatures were on the
sheet. Some people just won't put
their old John Hancock clearly on
paper. ‘I know who that is,’’ he said,
“and he sure does have a flamboyant
signature for an insurance sales-
man.”

Overwhelmed by the prodigy’s wit
I moved him across campus so that
he might hear some political banter.
“Who gives a----who wins’”’ was one
rather candid exclamation we heard
from a group of students. I refrained
from approaching them for I knew
they were too immersed in contem-
plating how much fungus and marine

life really exist in one of those leather
high tops used to stabilize any partic-
ular banner. My political dynamo,
however, didn’t hesitate to approach
the hostile crowd and ask, ‘‘Hey, why
do you demonstrate such flagrant
disrespect for so important an event
as an election?’ ‘‘Yo, kid, what are
you, a walking test? Now beat it be-
fore I wipe that dirt off your face with
a hatchet.”’ I quickly intervened and
drew him to the front of the Com-
merce School, where I hoped we
might find some real political think-
ers. Imagine the pleasure I exper-
ienced when I heard ‘Well, Skippy,
my political allegiance, if you will,
per se, remains with so and so,”’ “‘He
stands where I stand, come on, let’s
vote.’’ Before they were more than
two steps away, the young leader
stopped the primary interlocutor and
inquired, ‘“‘Where do both you and
your candidate stand?’’ The best
answer this pseudo-Wall Streeter
could generate was that they bought
their clothes in the same place

(Alvin-Dennis) and so and so could
throw down brew like no one else.
Completely disappointed,the poor
boy tu. aed and walked off campus.

Upon making him return the
clothes (you know they cost a lot), I
had to ask that pervading question,
‘What is your estimation of our poli-
tical climate during student body
elections?” ‘‘Well’’ he replied, ‘‘it
seems as though a large number of
your students don’t vote and do not
possess a reason for not doing so.
Further, those of your students who
do seemingly do so for all the wrong
reasons. I'm poor, my Dad shoots
pool for a living, but that humble way
of life stands safely apart from the
stench of lethargy and hypocrisy I
have smelled today.” As the boy
turned, a yelling fool ran by exclaim-
ing that our infamous so and so had
prevailed. I paused, yelled and threw
the $100 worth of political protocol,
hoping the child might find some use
for it.

Newspaper

READERS’
ADVOCATE
By Peter Wright

Last week, The Ring-tum Phi, its
editors and the general role of our
school paper were put into question.
A former Phi reporter, Steve Pock-
rass, had submitted a ‘‘Letter to the
Editor’ expressing his personal com-
plaints and criticisms involving some
of the actions and policies by the Phi
editors, Bruce Potter and Mike Allen.
Pockrass was still working for the
paper at the time he submitted the
letter, which was headlined ‘‘Does
the Phi lack initiative, direction?”
The editors fired Pockrass that very
same day for ‘‘cause.”’

Pockrass was not the first reporter
to have a run-in or major disagree-
ment with the Phi editors this year.
There was also Mike Hudson, who
had agreed to write the Readers’ Ad-
vocate column for The Phi. He decid-
ed later not to write the article fol-
lowing some disagreements with The
Phi and its policies, which were out-
lined in Pockrass’ letter.

Since that letter was published last
week, a lot of criticism has surfaced
concerning The Phi. I’ve heard harsh
comments from those who work for
The Phi as well as from the general
student body. Both editors admit
they are aware of the complaints and
want to address them. That has a lot
to do with why there is now a Read-
ers’ Advocate column.

In short, two very capable journa-
lists are no longer working for The
Phi because they can’t come to grips
with the editors and their policies.
The frustrations of these two report-
ers came to light with last week’s let-
ter. However, there was something
else accompanying that letter — an
‘Editors’ Note,’’ of all things. This
note, which immediately preceded
the letter itself, appeared to be a

 

templating suicide. It may be true
that those who talk about it are not
serious, but when someone tells me
that they want out, I choose to take it
seriously.

My friend had not been happy at
school last year but convinced him-
self to return in the fall. According to
him it was a miserable semester. I
wouldn’t know because he stopped
answering my letters. Perhaps that
was a clue I should have picked up
on, but I didn’t. He told me over the
phone that it was his mother and

father who talked him into returning
to school in January, not he. He want-
ed nothing more than to go down to
Australia and work on a horse farm.

Without hesitation I told him to go
to Australia. I would rather have him
down under than six feet under-
ground.

It hurt me to hear my friend talk
this way, but I was relieved that he
felt he could talk to someone. It is so
important to be able to reach out and
let someone know how you feel.

What could be so bad that someone

would want to call it quits? The po-
tential for accomplishing great
things would be gone. What would
this world be like if people such as
Mother Theresa and Pope John Paul
II decided they wanted to end their
lives? I’m not saying that every per-
son who contemplates suicide will
acheive greatness, but if they suc-
ceed in killing themselves we will
never know what may have been.
God gave us ears with which to hear
others, but do we really listen to what
they are saying?

Do jokes constitute harassment?

To the Editors:

It was with great amusement that I
read the article on sexual harass-
ment in the March 7 issue. While I
fully expected the Coeducation Steer-
ing Committee to spew forth such vit-
riolic swill as the sexual harassment
policy statement, I was totally unpre-
pared for Mrs. Simpson’s comment
that certain remarks would be
considered forms of sexual harass-
ment and would fall under Title IX of
the Education Act of 1972. I can see
the headlines now: ‘‘Student Jokes

scrutinized

disclaimer of the harsh criticism of
The Phi in the letter. The ‘Note’
stated “the letter contained a num-
ber of charges based on incomplete,
distorted information.” One problem
with this sweeping statement is not
only does it fail to specify what was
“incomplete” and ‘‘distorted,”’ but it
also fails to recognize some of the
valid points which were contained in
the letter. ‘“‘The temptation was
either to not print the letter or to
rebut it,”” the “Note” said. “The
editors should not have the last
word.” As it turns out, the editors
still attacked the article and in this
instance had the first word.

Potter said the ‘‘Editors’ note’ was
meant to inform the readers that
Pockrass was no longer working with
the Phi, which permitted him to write
a letter to the editor. My argument to
the editors is: ‘Why didn’t you just
run a sentence or two at the end of the
letter explaining the situation?’
After all, it’s not the editors’ column;
it’s the public’s. In short, the editors
chose to tell the public that this par-
ticular letter was ‘‘distorted’’ and
‘incomplete’ before they could get
to the first sentence. Do the editors
check every letter to see if any of the
information could possibly be dis-
torted or imcomplete?

Now, to check on the accuracy of
the letter. First, there’s Pockrass
and his complaints that it was ‘‘sheer
hyprocrisy”’ for the Phi not to con-
duct its analysis of Executive Com-
mittee members because the govern-
mental body didn’t do anything. I join
with Mr. Pockrass.

Another complaint by Pockrass
centered on The Phi’s decision not to
use one of his stories which had been
published in the Roanoke Times &
World-News. The article focused on
blacks at Washington and Lee and
their frustrations with the atmos-
phere at W&L. It’s no secret that the
Dean of Minority Affairs at W&L,
John White, is to be terminated at the

About Women Drivers; Justice De-
partment to Prosecute.”’

If Mrs. Simpson had any fleeting
association with the real world (ad-
mittedly a rare occurrence in acade-
mia), she would know that Title IX,
which is meant to prevent sexual dis-
crimination in education, applies on-
ly to institutions receiving federal
assistance, and not to individuals.

As former Darmouth student Jef-
frey Hart recently wrote, ‘One thing
is certain. ‘Women’ will disappoint
the feminists just as the ‘workers’

disappointed the old Marxists...the
‘liberation’ will be indefinitely post-
poned. They are likely to ruin a few
universities, however.”’ How true.

We are certainly lucky that this
sloppily worded policy has not been
implemented. I, for one, would pro-
bably have been expelled for refer-
ring to the Dean as ‘‘Mrs. Simpson,”’
which implies marriage and, there-
fore ‘speculates about her virgin-

over editorial decision

end of the year. Some students are
upset over this. Consequently, the
article concerning the blacks and
their frustrations had some timely
news value to the community.

But, as indicated in the letter, The
Phi didn’t run the article because it
was printed in the Roanoke Times. So
what? The important thing is to in-
form your community about the con-
ditions surrounding blacks at W&L.
In concentrating all its attention on
the competition, The Phi simply ig-
nored its public. The editors have
since assigned a follow-up story
about blacks at W&L.

The latter portion of Pockrass’ let-
ter concentrated on the relationship
between The Phi editors and Mike
Hudson, the original Readers’ Ad-
vocate columnist. Hudson wrote his
first article, referring to the accom-
plishments of The Phi and Allen par-
ticularly for getting an exclusive in-
terview with Scot Mesner last fall.
Hudson said he did not submit the
article because Potter and Allen
wanted to take some information out
of it. But, according to the editors,
they merely wanted to discuss and
question some of the information and
had no intention of deleting it without
Hudson’s approval. It appears this
incident could have been resolved
with a little understanding.
Nevertheless, The Phi should not
have any interest in even questioning
the content of a Readers’ Advocate
column, It’s not their column. The
column is designed to provide a
forum for the students to discuss,
analyze and critique the actions of
The Phi.

One subject that has not been ex-
plained is why The Phi fired Steve
Pockrass in the first place. After all,
he was one of The Phi’s more exper-
ienced reporters. Although Pockrass
was fired hours after he submitted
the letter, the editors say the letter
had nothing to do with it. According
to Allen, The Phi fired Pockrass for

four reasons. First, Pockrass’s re-
porting was ‘“‘getting worse, instead
of better,’ Allen said. Pockrass often
turned in stories without leads and
his work was ‘constantly inade-
quate,’’ Allen said. Still, Allen prais-
ed some of the work Pockrass did for
the Roanoke Times. Secondly, Allen
said the editors and Pockrass had a
disagreement concerning some of the
basics of journalism. Allen said
Pockrass wrote stories based on
subjective and opinionated ideas.
“We couldn’t trust him,”’ Allen said.
Thirdly, Allen said Pockrass violated
some of the standards of the paper,
such as consistently missing dead-
lines. In addition, Allen said there
was no reason to continue the rela-
tionship between Pockrass and The
Phi because he was unhappy and was
only hurting the paper by staying on.
Lastly, Allen said there were some
personal differences between them.
To get around this, Allen offered the
competitive EC beat to Pockrass.
‘*We knew he was good, and we want-
ed to keep him,” Allen said. But
things just didn’t work out.

As for Mr. Pockrass, he seems con-
tent with this whole ordeal. Pockrass
said he just wanted to help the paper
improve itself. He said he has al-
ready noticed progress.

The Phi has indeed made some
mistakes this year, but it’s had its
accomplishments as well. The edi-
tors must face their downfalls and
confront them, not hide them. As was
pointed out in the so called ‘‘Editors’
Note,” Potter and Allen are serious
in their conviction to providing a for-
um for all the students. ‘‘We have to
have people talk about the paper,”’
Potter said. “We realize there is
room for improvement.’ Indeed
there is, but The Phi now appears to
be taking some of its initiative and
giving the paper some direction.

On-campus housing the only alternative

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
' Staff Reporter

 

Students who did not confirm their

‘on-campus University housing by
' Tuesday may find that their rooms

have been reassigned.
However, some options, including

. off-campus housing, do remain for

students who have not lined up any

’ on-campus housing.

Getting on the waiting list for on-
campus housing as soon as possible is

’ the advice of the Office of University
, Services.

* dous,”

“The waiting list can be tremen-
said Director William N.

. Mohler, ‘but not necessarily reflec-

tive.”
In past years, students who seemed

, to have no chance of getting a room

on campus have found themselves

' signing a contract for a Woods Creek
. apartment or a Lee House room.

This is because students with room

‘ assignments often change their
. minds about housing plans during the

spring, Mohler explained
Some students may not have even

. considered their living arrangements

for next year despite the Feb. 1 ap-

* plication deadline for on-campus
. housing.

But Mohler said he would never
turn down a student’s application. ‘I

_ try to work with them as much as I

.

can,” he said.

Bonnie Walker, who works in the
Office of University Services, could
not say for sure the chances of a stu-
dent applying for housing at this
point and getting a room for next
year.

“It’s going to be hard,”’ she said.
“But then again, you never can tell.
It’s one of those things.”

On-campus housing for W&L

includes Woods Creek apartments,
Lee House II, the Minority Center
and the International House.

University-owned housing, ex-
cluding dormitories, can accom-
modate 210 students, and about 16
percent of upperclass under-
graduates liveon campus.

Woods Creek Apartments accom-
modate three, four or five students,
and the cost each academic year
ranges from $960 for a double to
$1,575 for the most expensive single,
including utilities.

‘I’m inclined to prefer our people
live on campus,”’ said Mohler, point-
ing out that some of the advantages
of the apartments are their kitchen
facilities, freedom and ‘‘together-
ness.”

In October, 126 upperclassmen liv-
ed in the 178-bed complex, which was
built in 1975 at a cost of $1.76 million.
Law students rented the other rooms.

Lee House II, owned by the Univer-
sity, has been used for a number of
years mainly as upperclass housing
but sometimes for freshman over-
flow.

The facility includes three single
rooms ($1,270 a year) and nine
doubles ($845 a year).

The Minority Center, next to Lee II
on Lee Avenue, houses three students
in single rooms at $1,380 a year. Two
students share a double at $960 a year
each.

The specialized use of the original
Lee I for minorities began in recent
years.

The final on-campus option for up-
perclassmen is the International
House on Washington Street, two
doors from Gilliam Dormitory.

This facility is headquarters to
W&L’s International Club and is
often the scene of meetings and par-

‘“‘We help integrate international
students into the University commu-
nity,’’ said Michael Wacht, a sopho-
more who currently resides in the
Louse. ‘We give them a place to
come and hang out,”’ he said.

Lu Chang from China lives in the
house this year, and three interna-
tional students from Brazil, Belgium
and Hong Kong will reside there next
year.

A single room costs $1,380 a year
and a double costs $960.

‘“‘We have six beds, two baths, one
kitchen, two doors — I haven’t count-

in protest of that company’s involve-
ment in South Africa has been post-
poned in light of information recently
received by protest organizers.

W&L law Professor William S. Gei-
mer said he received a call from IBM
in response to a letter he wrote the
company inquiring about its sale of
computers and other machines to
South African police and military or-

“ ganizations. Geimer had asked IBM

to confirm reports that it controls 70
percent of the computer market in
South Africa, and to withdraw the

- part of its computer business that is

used by that country’s security

" forces.

During the phone call, Geimer
said, an IBM representative told him

"that the company had ceased sales in
. South Africa. On the basis of that in-

formation, the group planning the
protest has decided to postpone its

’ plans.

-

«

Geimer, associate religion Profes-

sor Harlan R. Beckley and law Pro-
fessor Athornia Steele had organized
a protest, originally scheduled for
tomorrow, to ask that the University
Board of Trustees withdraw its in-
vestments in IBM to protest that
company’s business involvement in
South Africa, whose government fol-
lows the white-supremacist policy of
apartheid.

To ensure a sense of fairness, Gei-
mer said, he drafted a letter to IBM
to verify reports that the company
was involved in assisting the South
African police and security organiza-
tions, particularly in their ad-
ministration of the ‘‘pass system”
that regulates the movements of the
black majority population. Reported-
ly, IBM’s computers are used to run
this system.

Further information regarding
IBM’s involvement, or disinvolve-
ment, in South Africa is being sent to
Geimer, he said.

The response from IBM is a good
sign, Geimer said, because it shows
that efforts such as the one planned
here at Washington and Lee have
been successful on other campuses

Dawson gets job offer

 

From Staff Reports

 

While many Washington and Lee
seniors are scrambling for some-
thing to do after they graduate, stu-

* dent body President Cole Dawson is

among those who can rest a little
easier.

“It’s very nice to have several op-
tions,” he said.

Two weeks ago, Dawson was of-

" fered a position with the investment

firm of Smith Barney, and he has
been accepted by the Southern
Methodist University law school.

He said he will likely accept a
banking job and then return to school

" ina few years.

* said.

“Tf I really like investment bank-
ing, I’ll go on to business school,”’ he
“Otherwise, I'll go to law

. school.”’

If Dawson accepts the Smith
Barney position, he would be in their

_ corporate financial analyst program,

which lasts for two years. There is no
commitment after that time, and he

_ would be free to go to graduate '

si

school.

In the analyst program, ‘‘you doa
lot of research and study for the
associates, partners and vice
presidents,’’ he said.

He added that the analysts put ina
70-90 hour week. “It’s a lot of
weekends and staying a lot of nights
until one, three or five in the morn-
ing,’’ he explained.

‘Personality plays into it a lot,” he
continued. ‘‘They want very aggres-
sive, very dependable people. Being
articulate is definitely a criteria.”

Dawson has been accepted for a
program this summer in which he
will lead a group of 15 high school
students on van and bike tours of
Europe. He will work there for six to
seven weeks, and then spend some
time in Europe on his own.

across the country. There is a net-
work of organizations that monitors
American business activities in
South Africa, Geimer said, and he is
depending on these groups as well as
the information from IBM to confirm
IBM’s claim.

Many protests across the country
develop in this sort of grass-roots
manner, according toa recent article
in Newsweek magazine. Demonstra-
tions in some 20 cities have taken
place, the most notable in front of the
South African embassy in Washing-
ton, D.C. The Washington Post this
week put: the number of anti-apart-
heid demonstrators arrested at the
embassy at 1,442, many of them con-
gressmen, celebrities and national
figures, including Sen. Lowell
Weicker, the wife of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry, Stevie Wonder,
the children of the late Sen. Robert F’.
Kennedy and, on Monday, the Rev.
Jesse L. Jackson and two of his sons.

Geimer said the campaign at
Washington and Lee will be delayed,
out of fairness to IBM, until April or
May while organizers examine the
new information about IBM’s in-
volvement in South Africa.

Girard allowed

Senior Gene Girard, charged
March 1 with possession of co-
caine with intent to distribute it,
has been allowed to return to his
home near Miami.

The terms of his bail required
that he obtain court permission to
leave Virginia.

Lexington General District
Judge Joseph E. Hess granted the
request last Wednesday. Girard is
required to return for his prelimi-
nary hearing April 19.

Rockbridge County Sheriff's
Sergeant R.W. Hall said Girard
was arrested at the East Lexing-

individual needs.

A housing survey conducted in the
fall shows that more than 50 percent
of upperclassmen rent houses and
apartments in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County.

According to the survey results,
nearly 70 percent of students pay
monthly rents of $100 and under.

Lisa Householder, a Lexington re-
sident who works at the Hodge Podge
on Main Street, recently found
herself an apartment in town.

Householder found that most peo-
ple don’t advertise when they want to
rent out a room or apartment be-
cause they try to be selective about
their tenants.

“They don’t want people who are

too wild,”’ she said.

Householder said she began her
hunt with a list of 15 names gathered
“by word-of-mouth.’ She found the
telephone to be a great resource
since she did not ‘‘actively’’ go out
and look at many apartments.

“Most of them struck me down
pretty quickly,’’ she said, but added
that spring’s high turnover would
probably be a better time to look.

University Services offers students
a small file of apartments for rent in
Lexington.

“The list changes constantly and is
hard to keep current,”’ Mohler said,
“but it is in some semblance of
order.”’

The cards on file include names of

for rent and the rental prices.

Several Lexington-area real estate
agents also help students find apart-
ments androoms.

Alice Strecker, rental manager for
Mead Associates, said she handles
mainly two-bedroom but also one-
bedroom apartments with rental
costs in the $150 to $300 range.

Strecker, who does not charge a
fee, said she does not have many
available since most have been rent-
ed.

Another off-campus option is the
Lampost, a Christian housing center
located at 202 S. Randolph St.

‘‘We make a commitment to grow
together in Christ,” said Robert
Dorais, a senior at the house.

Students are assigned house jobs,
such as taking out the garbage, shop-
ping for groceries, planning menus
and cleaning bathrooms. The stu-
dents eat together three nights a
week and must make their beds
every day.

The Lexington Organization for
Religious Development (LORD)
operates the Lampost and charges
$90 a month plus a $5 monthly living
cost and a $5 monthly insurance fee.
These expenses do not include elec-
tricity, gas or phone bills.

The Lampost is open to anyone who
wants to make the commitment, ac-
cording to Dorais. Seven of the 10
rooms are still available for next
school year.

“We don’t want to go around re-
cruiting people,’’ Dorais said. ‘It’s
all voluntary.”

The Dutch Inn on Washington
Street is very popular among stu-
dents because it is located less than
one block from the main campus. In-
terested students should contact Nit-
za Macheras at 463-3835.

Kappa Sigma’s kitchen ‘trashed’

 

From Staff Reports

 

The kitchen of Kappa Sigma frater-
nity house was ‘‘trashed’’ Saturday
night, likely by another fraternity,
Kappa Sig President John Haywood
said.

He estimated the damage from the
action, in which food was strewn
around the ktichen while the house
was unoccupied, at $500.

“The indication is that it was
another fraternity,’’ he said. ‘‘It was
obviously a malicious act of van-
dalism aimed at the house. In all
likelihood, it was a past or présent

member of another fraternity.”

He said the Interfraternity Council
and Student Affairs Committee are
investigating the incident.

“I can’t speculate on who might
have done it,’’ Haywood said. ‘‘We do
not know at this time for sure who did
it. | would hate to wrongly implicate
someone.”

“We're still investigating it,’’ IFC
President David Perdue said after
Tuesday’s Judicial Board meeting.
‘We haven’t gotten to the bottom of
it.”

Athletics adapting to women

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Adaptation of the athletic depart-
ment’s facilities, staff and programs
in order to provide women with an
athletic and physical education pro-
gram next year is proceeding rapid-
ly.

Women will compete in five indi-
vidual intercollegiate sports next
year, and women will take the same
physical education courses as men,
Athletic Director William D. McHen-
ry said.

Provisions for two additional team
locker rooms, a division of the main
physical education locker room into
men’s and women’s locker rooms,
additional tennis courts and addi-
tional playing fields have also been
either implemented or planned.

An assistant athletic director, Cin-
da Rankin, has been hired to coordi-
nate women’s athletic activities and
will start work in two weeks, and a
female intern in athletic training will
be hired by the fall, McHenry said.

‘We're right on target,”” McHenry
said, He said he had anticipated the
Board of Trustees’ approval of coed-

ucation and had begun making preli-
minary plans for a women’s athletic
program more than a year ago. In
September he appointed a committee
on coeducation in the athletic depart-
ment that met regularly this fall,
McHenry said.

During the first.two years of coed-
ucation, the athletic department will
field women in individual sports
teams such as cross country, track
and field, swimming and diving, ten-
nis and golf, McHenry said. He added
that women’s teams could be fielded
in those sports with minimal changes
in facilities and with the coaches of
the men’s teams doubling as coaches
for the corresponding women’s team.

McHenry reported that the results

women accepted for Early Admis-
sion shows that the major interest of
those women seems to be in cross
country, swimming and tennis. On
the other hand, even if only one or
two freshmen women want to play
golf next year, for instance, they still
will have the chance to compete, Mc-
Henry said.

The athletic department will grad-
ually add team sports for women
over a period of five to 10 years. The
choice of first sports to be added will
depend largely on the level of interest
of the women, McHenry said. The
department will try to gear its inter-
collegiate program to the needs of
the women at W&L, McHenry added.

Women's teams will compete in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference,
as W&L’s men’s team do, he said.

McHenry said he hoped that within
two or three years the school will be
able to field women’s basketball and
volleyball teams. He noted that the
new assistant athletic director, Ran-
kin, is a basketball coach.

No expansion in the size of the phy-
sical education department coaching
staff is planned, and any women
coaches who are hired will be
brought in through normal attrition
of the existing staff, McHenry said.
He said that several of the men on the
staff could help coach women’s
teams.

McHenry said that it is hoped the
school will not have to drop any exist-
ing sports due to a decrease in inter-
est, and added that he could not think
of any sport that would be in danger
in the future.

In intramural athletics, the depart-
ment will have some all-male intra-

mural sports, some all-female intra- _

murals and some coed intromural
sports, McHenry said.

All physical education courses will
be open to both men and women, and
there will be no changes in the Uni-
versity’s physical education require-
ments, McHenry said.

4 students’ money stolen from dorms, frats

 

From Staff Reports

 

Half a dozen offenses against
students, including thefts from dor-
mitory and fraternity rooms, were
reported in Lexington last week,
Police Chief L.0. Sutton said.

eMatthew Upton reported that his
wallet was stolen from Graham-Lees
room 154 last Wednesday. While he
was in-the shower between. 9:50 and
10 pam., someone entered the room
and took the wallet from a desk
drawer, he said.

It contained $70 in currency, two
credit cards, five blank checks and a
student ID card. Police advised him
to search trash cans in the building,
and he found the wallet had been
discarded in a restroom, Sutton said.
The only item missing from the
wallet was one $20 bill.

¢David Barnette reported the theft
of $80 from a wallet in Graham-Lees
room 206 between Tuesday afternoon
and Thursday evening. The door had
been left open, Sutton said.

room and the coach’s locker room,
McHenry said.

Work on the division of the main
locker room will begin June 1, as
soon as the students leave, McHenry
said. Additional lockers will be added
to accomodate the increased size of
the freshman class, McHenry said.

Additional tennis courts already
have been provided through the re-
novation of the lower tennis courts
below the footbridge this fall.

Two or three additional outside
athletic fields will be needed in the
coming years to accomodate wo-
men’s field hockey, lacrosse and soft-
ball teams, McHenry reported. Plans
for these fields have not been approv-
ed yet, but McHenry is recommend-
ing that these fields be added in the
area between U.S. 60 and Liberty
Hall.

At Wilson Field, the school is con-
sidering adding more rest rooms and
locker space, McHenry said.

He added that the school is also
considering plans to turn the track at
Wilson Field into an all-weather
track by converting it into an artifi-
cial surface with a rubberized tex-
ture. At present, the track is unus-
able during the winter, McHenry
said.

Scholars

program

beginning to draw
disciplines closer

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Until now, an English major could
get a 4.0 and never know a chemistry
major with similar academic creden-
tials.

But the formation of a new pro-
gram at Washington and Lee is help-
ing to bring “aggressively intellec-
tual’’ students from different fields of
study together in a formal atmos-
phere.

Known as the University Scholars
Program, it combines studies in the
liberal arts with courses in the stu-
dent’s major in a ‘four-year honors
program,” according to H. Thomas
Williams Jr., chairman of the Uni-
versity Scholars Committee and an
associate professor of physics.

Williams said the University creat-
ed the program because many of the
school’s brighter students felt ‘‘iso-
lated.”’

“Prior to the creation of the pro-
gram, you would have a very bright
student who would end up as a chem-
istry major who didn’t know a bright
English major,’’ he said. ‘‘Our goal
with this program was forming a
mass of students who were eager to
learn and letting them know who
each other are.”

To meet this goal, the program has
a curriculum that promotes open dis-
cussion between students and with
faculty members and distinguished
visitors brought to campus.

That curriculum consists of a read-
ing course and a coordinating hu-
manities seminar in the freshman
year, seminars in the natural social

and right front door were damaged
by a sharp object scraping into the
paint. “It wasn’t an accident,” he
said. ‘‘To get all that, it would have to
be deliberate.”’

Sutton said that overall Fancy
Dress weekend seemed to go very
well.

“T have heard some remarks that
this Fancy Dress was one of the most
orderly and well-handled that have
been around for awhile,”’ he said.

The weekend, however, was not
without its problems, Sutton added.
“T think the conditions of trash and
broken bottles on sidewalks and in
the street or strewn in front of the

Phi honored by press group.

Three Ring-tum Phi staff members
won first-place awards and the news-
paper finished second overall in its
circulation greup in the 1984 Virginia
Intercollegiate Mass Communica-
tions Association journalism compet-
ition

The competition covered news-
papers published during the 1983-84
year. The Phi competed with other
Virginia college newspapers with
less than 3,000 circulation.

Chief Editor Mike Allen, then a
staff reporter, won first place in the
investigative reporting category for
his series of stories about the special
grand jury investigating drug traf-
ficking. Allen also received an honor-

sciences in the sophomore and junior
years, and honors courses and theses
in the senior year.

“I think the idea of the program is
great,” said Chris Carter, a sopho-
more from Chickasha, Okla. “To
have a course geared toward any in-
terdisciplinary study is a good idea.”’

Qualifications for participating in
the program are vague, Williams
said, but include scores on the Scho-
lastic Aptitude Test and involvement
in extracurricular and leadership ac-
tivities. There is no minimum re-
quirement for any of these categor-
ies, he added.

Most of all, the committee looks for
a desire to learn, he said.

“Students in University Scholars

are aggressive intellectually. They
have taken part in advance place-
ment program’s in high school and in
other learning experiences,” he said.
“They're the kind of people who get
excited over ideas.”

Matthew Harrington, a freshman,

said he is the kind of person that Wil- ,

liams described. ‘‘I’m interested in
learning a lot of things and Univer-
sity Scholars provides a lot of oppor-
tunities.”’

Created in 1983, the program began
this year. Sixteen students — 13
freshmen and three sophmores — are
currently in the program. Since Jan-
uary, they have been reading Virgil’s
“Aeneid” and other works to prepare
for a seminar titled ‘‘The Idea of the
Pilgrimage in English Literature.”

Fifteen students are expected to be
added to the program next year.
They will be selected from entering
freshmen and current freshmen and
sophomores.

“T think the fraternities should be a

some of this is a little out of hand and
unnecessary.”

Sutton said no legal action was °
taken against any fraternities as a
result of Fancy Dress parties.

“I think they were unnecessarily +
loud, but no summons were issued,”
he said. “It was handled without
summons.” ’

be to ease the transition to coeduca-
tion without “‘over-compensating for
the females.”’

“I want to see a lot of traditions
kept through the transition,” he add-
ed. ‘Being on the ground floor of co-
education, I think it’s important for
us to prepare for coeducation, but I
don’t think we need to be paranoid

Durrette:
‘recapture

greatness’

 

By MIKE ALLEN

_ Chief Editor

 

Leading Republican gubernatorial
candidate Wyatt B. Durrette Jr. told
a Lexington audience Tuesday night
that his candidacy represents a
chance to ‘“‘recapture the greatness
of Virginia.”’

Durrette leads Republican oppo-
nent Congressman Stan E. Parris in
delegates, endorsements and contri-
butions. “‘What got us here was an
awful lot of hard work,” he told the
Rockbridge County Courthouse au-
dience of 50. ‘‘Any letup in that, and
things could change.”

After attending Virginia Military
Institute, Durrette graduated from
the Washington and Lee law school in
1964.

“| guess I get a little more serious
and reflective when I am brought to
Lexington, where so much of my past
has been,’’ he said at the forum spon-
sored by the Lexington-Rockbridge
Republican Committee.

He said that while he was proud of
the VMI experience, ‘“‘it wasn’t a
heck of a lot of fun during those four
years.”’

While he was at W&L, Durrette
founded the now-defunct W&L Con-
servative Society. Among his co-
founders was Donald W. Huffman,
now the chairman of the state Repub-
lican party.

“These next four years for Virginia
are going to be unique,” said Dur-
rette, a former member of the House
of Delegates who now practices law
in Richmond. ‘‘In these four years,
we will celebrate the bicentennial of
the ratification of the U. S. Constitu-
tion.”

 

By Bruce Potter/The Ringtum Phi

Republican gubernatorial candidate Wyatt Durrette addresses a Rockbridge County Courthouse gathering.

“In those days, Virginia was not a
leading state; it was the leading
state,”’ he continued. ‘‘The towering
geniuses of the Commonwealth were
unparalleled in any of the other
states collectively.”

He said in recent years Virginia
has slipped on some rankings of
states by economic growth and quali-
ty of educational program. ‘We're
better than that and we deserve to be
near the top,”’ he said. “I want with
you to together recapture the great-
ness of Virginia.”

Durrette said the Commonwealth
should be attractive to business be-
cause ‘believe it or not, we are a low-
tax state.”

He spoke of the state’s ‘‘excellent
educational system” and ‘‘the multi-
Plicity of talent at Virginia's univer-
sities.”’

One man in the audience prefaced
a question about the federal budget

deficit by admitting the subject was
something ‘‘I’m sure you’re sick of.”’

The deficit ‘‘is a time bomb waiting
to go off,”’ said Durrette, who added
that he supports a Constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced
budget.

He said that the GOP has “‘a very
good chance”’ of achieving a majori-
ty in the Democratically controlled
legislature in the near future.

Durrette was introduced by Lex-
ington mayor and W&L economics
Professor Charles F. Phillips Jr.
“There is tremendous enthusiasm
within the Republican party,” Phil-
lips said. ‘‘We have a number of first-
rate candidates.”

“T have already pledged my sup-
port...to the next governor of the
state of Virginia, Wyatt Durrette,”
he concluded.

“Thank you very much,”’ the can-
didate began. “‘That’s the nicest in-

troduction I could have had.”

“From Chuck Phillips,” said a
voice from the back of the room.

“From anybody,’’ Durrette re-
sponded immediately.

Commonwealth's Attorney Bever-
ly C. “John” Read shook hands cord-
ially and joked easily with members
of the audience, many of whom he
called by name.

When signups were being taken for
delegates to the upcoming state Re-
publican convention, one man gave
his name as Jim Jones. ‘Better
make that ‘James Jones,” said
Read, making reference to the cult
leader who led his followers to
suicide in South America.

One of Durrette’s proud supporters
introduced his companions to
a reporter as “prominent local Re-
publicans.”’

‘All Republicans are prominent,”’
his wife kidded.

“As usual in an institution that is
aggressive and committed to quality,

. there are more demands than you
-ean satisfy,’’ he continued. ‘‘We’re

trying to find what it is that we’re do-
ing that we needn’t do or that might
not be as important to our growth and

* . development.”’

For example, he said the ‘‘easy ac-

_ cess” students and faculty have to

University facilities overnight is a
nice luxury, ‘‘But is it necessary to
have five floors of the library burning
all night? I think it’s worth asking,”’

» hesaid.

Student Reaction: The catalog cut-
back suggestion received no positive
response at Monday’s EC meeting,
and the Library Advisory Commit-
tee, which includes student mem-
bers, voted unanimously last week to
recommend that the library main-
tain its 24-hour schedule.

Student Body President Cole Daw-
son said he and most students he’s
talked with disagree with both of
those savings possibilities.

“I think the students are opposed to
these changes,’’ he said. “If the ad-
ministration pursues these, it will
hear the students’ voice, because
they really affect student life on cam-
pus.”’

“It strikes me as strange that
they’re all coming now,” he said of
the possible economy measures. “I
think they’re just ideas. I don’t think
the administration is backing these
ideas.”’

Administrators Respond:

” University officials said that student

opinion is important to them, but
some express mild frustration with
the ‘rhetoric’? they say has
accompanied discussion of the cut-
back potentials.

Wilson said the administration is
“very responsive” to student senti-
ment and that it is “going to go slow-
ly” on any major change such as a
reduction in library hours.

“I think it is extraordinary that a
thing like that has received as much
attention as it has,” he said. ‘I was
simply asking the librarian for a
judgment on that.”

“T think it’s extraordinary for an
institution devoted to the develop-
ment of critica] intelligence to react
passionately to every proposal that
comes out,’’ he added.

“People say to me, ‘What is
$24,000?’ My answer is that that is a
faculty position at Washington and
Lee. That also buys several financial
aid packages. That’s what $24,000
ne

Elrod said student body opinion
“will not be ignored’ and that when
it comes to making a decision, stu-
dent views will be a ‘‘not inconse-
quential’’ consideration.

“We are not a bunch of money-
pinching Scotsmen who are trying to
save money for its own sake,” Elrod
said. ‘‘We’re trying to make sure that
the money we do spend is well-
spent.”

“We're interested in enhancing the
educational program and the quality
of the student body,” he continued.
“That costs money.”

Epley said of the negative reaction
to the proposals that ‘‘about all I can
do is extend my sympathy to the stu-
dents that are discomfited.”’

“From my vantage point, if it
comes to a decision between adjust-
ing the salary of a valued faculty,
member to what it should be and
closing the library overnight, that’s
an easy choice for me,” he said.

He said students don’t seem to be
concerned about the effect these
issues have on their pocketbooks.
“We found that if we closed the
library overnight, we could save
$25,000 to $30,000 a year,’’ he said.
“But there’s a terrible outcry and we
cannot do that.”

“Everyone says, ‘You'll ruin the
educational experience here,’ ’’ he
continued. ‘‘If you’re not willing to
make that kind of sacrifice, then the
only give is to jack up the tuition.”’

Revenue Squeeze: Epley said
budgets are tighter than usual this
year because of a lull in non-tuition
University income.

“So much has happened here over
the last 10-15 years that allowed us to
add these programs and positions
without having to pay for them
without too much difficulty,” he said.

“I think people have grown accus-
tomed to or taken it for granted that
because of the breaks we’ve had, that
we can continue as we have in the
past to always add and never sacri-
fice.”

Epley said the ‘‘enormous infusion
of cash”’ in 1976 from the $13-million
Pratt Fund was a part of that cush-
ion. He added that the Board of
Trustees has elected to spend income
from endowment at a slightly lower
level next year than this year.

Tuition next year will cover 65 per-

cent of the cost of a student’s educa-
tion — up from the old target of 60
percent. ‘‘We're having to look to tui-
tion for a greater percentage of oper-
ating expenses than in the past,”
Epley said.

Hotchkiss explained that the Uni-
versity is in between the $67-million
development program that ended in
1982 and the drive he expects will
begin in the next few years ‘‘to carry
us through the balance of the cen-
tury.”

“People have a lot of ambition for
Washington and Lee and everyone
wants to keep moving as vigorously
as we did for the last 10 to 12 years,”’
he said. ‘‘It makes you feel restricted
now that the rate of progress is not'as
large.”

Spending Demands: Wilson said a
number of areas are requiring in-
creased funds at the same time that
revenue increases are shrinking.

“‘We believe that faculty and staff
salaries and faculty professional de-
velopment funds for travel and re-
search support are major priorities
that have to beserved,”’ he said.

‘‘Beyond that, we have some extra-
ordinary needs this year,”’ he con-
tinued, noting that those include the
additional staff positions and fac-
ilities modifications required for
coeducation, a new mainframe aca-
demic computer, a new journalism
department computer, more finan-
cial aid and additional professors to
handle the new General Education

Requirements.

Elrod noted that ‘‘we don’t want to
lose the current student-faculty
ratio” and that the expected growth
of the student body by 100 over the
next decade “may require the addi-
tion of one position.”’

The Outlook: Administrators said
there are several factors that compel
them to continue their quest for cut-
backs.

Admissions Director William M.
Hartog III said that ‘‘cost comes up
all the time”’ in interviews with pro-
spective students. ‘‘It would behoove
us to try to keep our costs down as
muchas wecan,” hesaid.

Epley agreed. “‘It seems tome that
in the past we have been more apt to
raise tuition than to focus on saVings
opportunities,’’ he said. “If we’re go-
ing to stay in sound financial shape,
there is going to have to be a change
in that.”

Wilson said bottom-line considera-
tions dictate his approach. ‘‘I have to
present the trustees with a balanced
budget,’’ he explained. ‘‘Nobody else
has that responsibility — no dean, no
member of the faculty. I have to re-
concile all the demands of all the
departments.”

Epley said juggling those 150
department budgets does not engen-
der much gratitude. “Some of the
things I’ve done here haven’t been
popular,” he said. ‘‘Somebody has to
be unpopular, I suppose. It goes with
the job.”’

 

Ban asked on midweek bands

The Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board has recommended
that bands at midweek parties be
prohibited after the board deadlock-
ed Tuesday over whether Sigma
Alpha Epsilon should be penalized
for that action.

SAE had the band ‘‘Embarrassing
Stains’ at its house the Wednesday
before Fancy Dress, but there cur-
rently is no rule against that. ‘‘It’s
never been done before,”’ IFC Presi-
dent David Perdue said.

Perdue is a member of SAE and so
did not vote on the question. The
board was left with a 3-3 tie, meaning
that no penalty was given.

The party was not illegal, Perdue
explained, because ‘“‘it was of a spon-
taneous nature and was a pitch-in.”’

“The band was not booked,” he
said.

not to exceed $1,000 on each charge.

By law, defense contractors are
permitted to add a percentage of
overhead costs to the price of wea-
pons systems only after negotiating
with the Pentagon.

Spanton uncovered information
proving that Pratt and Whitney had
increased prices on spare parts by as
much as 300 percent. An internal Air
Force report later confirmed this.

The company also made a $67,500
contribution to the Oklahoma Art
Center. The wife of Air Force Maj.
Gen. J.T. Edwards was on the board
of the art center. Pratt and Whitney
later asked for reimbursement, call-
ing the donation a “‘business over-
head expense.”

Spanton’s return to auditing came
from an invitation by the House
Energy and Commerce Committee’s
investigation into General Dyna-
mics’ expenses.

Investigators have accused the
company of wining and dining mili-
tary brass and congressmen and sub-
mitting bills for personal trips to Las
Vegas and West Palm Beach, coun-
try club dues, golf trips, chili cook-
offs and the boarding of an execu-
tive’s dog.

Spanton will be visiting journa-
lism, politics, accounting and econo-
mics classes Tuesday and Wednes-
day. His speech, according to Mollen-
hoff, will be about the obstacles
whistleblowers face in trying to in-
itiate sound accounting practices in-
volving major defense contractors.

He will speak at 7:30 p.m.

George Spanton, a former govern-
ment auditor and ‘‘whistleblower,”
will speak in Lee Chapel Tuesday
night.

Spanton has recently come out of
retirement to help investigate alleg-
ed improprieties by General Dyna-
mics, the nation’s largest defense
contractor.

General Dynamics is being inves-
tigated by three congressional com-
mittees, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Internal Revenue
Service, the Justice Department and
the Navy for allegedly submitting
false reimbursement claims.

Spanton is best known for his work
as branch audit chief for the Defense
Contract Audit Agency in West Palm
Beach, Fla. The DCAA is the audit
agency for the Defense Department.
His work there was helped to promi-
nence by Washington and Lee Jour-
nalism Professor Clark R. Mollen-
hoff, a reporter for The Washington
Times.

Spanton filed a grievance with the
Merit System Protection Board
charging his immediate supervisor,
DCAA Director Charles Starrett and
regional DCAA director Paul Evans
with attempting to force him to re-
sign.

The reason for this, according to
Spanton, was his demands for access
to financial records of defense con-
tractors and for trying to start an
agency-wide study of ‘excessive
wage costs’’ paid to executives of
these companies.

The Pratt and Whitney Aircraft
Co., the largest producer of military
aircraft engines and a subsidiary of
United Technologies Corp., was the
major target of his investigation.

Starrett approved actions taken by
Evans in 1982 to force Spanton to take
an unwanted and premature ‘‘rota-
tional transfer’ from West Palm
Beach, where he had been stationed
for almost five years, to Newport
Beach, Calif.

Starrett defended his action by
calling the move “‘routine”’ and bas-
ed on agency policy, which he said
ordered the transfer of auditors to
different locations after five years.

Heels throttle
lax team, 19-5

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

When the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team returned from Chapel
Hill, N.C., Saturday evening, their
eyes and voices said all that needed
to be said about their game against
the University of North Carolina

they had lost. The final score of 19-5
seemed somewhat surprising, but it
was true. The Generals’ record now
stands at 1-1.

The Generals’ game plan was to
control the tempo and hold onto the
ball. All seemed to be going well as
junior attackman Caulley Deringer
broke through the Tar Heel defense
and scored the Generals’ first goal,
giving them a 14 lead. But soon
thereafter, the score was tied at one.
The rest of the first half would
foreshadow what was to come as the
‘Tar Heels’ offensive machine took a
sizeable 8-2 halftime lead.

“We were disappointed at half.
Guys felt we could still win, but we
had bitter feelings,’’ said senior co-
captain David Johnston. ‘Offense
had controlled the ball really well,
and the key to the first period was
that the offense held onto the ball for
four or five minutes at a time.”’

“North Carolina is an excellent of-
fensive team, so we wanted to control
the tempo and limit their opportuni-
ties. Our strategy worked at first, but
then they exploded,’’ head coach
Dennis Daly said.

The explosion was one of nuclear
power in the second half. The

Generals would move the ball down
the field, take a shot and miss. The
Generals seldom recovered their own
shots and UNC would make the tran-

Tough matches drop netmen to .500

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee tennis
Generals record remains at .500 after
they soundly defeated Slippery Rock,
8-1, last Thursday,
Bloomsburg Tuesday, 6-2-1.

The team was able to show its
strength against Slippery Rock, win-
ning every match with the exception
of the match at No. 1 singles.

Against Bloomsburg, W&L had a
much closer match, which Coach
Gary Franke called ‘‘a disappointing
defeat for the Generals.”

No. i singles man Jack Messerly,
who earlier in the day had been in the
infirmary with the flu, continued to
come up against tough opponents. He
suffered his fourth straight loss, 74,
6-1

Andy Haring also had a difficult
time, losing in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3.

W&L’s two victories came from the
No. 3 and the No. 6 singles spots. No.
3 Roby Mize was able to play his type
of game and forced his opponents in-
to error-prone tennis to get the match
win. Scott Adams, at No. 6, continued
his winning streak with a 6-1, 6-3
straight-set victory.

Arguably, the most crucial match-
es for W&L were at No. 2 and No. 5
singles where David McLeod and
Chris Wiman both battled strong
Bloomsburg opponents, coming up

and lost. to.

sition. In a flash of light and swing of
the stick, the UNC offense was set-
ting up. The key fact of the game was
that when UNC missed shots, they
retrieved the ball. Then they would
set up and try to score again, which
they were very successful at. The
Tar Heels outscored the Generals
11-3 in the second half.

For many Washington and Lee
students who seem to classify
themselves as lacrosse experts, the
19-5 loss was a perfect chance to
ridicule the team. ‘‘They should just
play Division III lacrosse and take
the championship’’ was heard from
more than just one student. But
that’s not the attitude of the Division
I Generals. They lost, and maybe
they haven’t quite recovered from
the shellshock, but they have
recovered from UNC.

“It’s over and done with,’’ senior
Sandy Brown said. ‘‘We learned from
it. Now we have to get it back and re-
bound. And the season is not blown
out by any stretch of the imagina-
tion.”

Johnston agreed with Brown, say-
ing, ‘““We’re not going to give up the
rest of the season because of one loss.
We'll put it behind us and move on.”’

The 1985 lacrosse team is one with
character and good vision. They
realize that each week they probably
are an underdog but they fight on.
UNC didn’t take any prisoners and
the Generals are still a tightly knit
group of athletes. According to Daly,
at Monday's practice, the ‘“‘phrase”’
going around was, “UNC didn't
break us — it was a loss and that’s
is.”

Despite the one-sided loss, Daly
saw some bright spots. ‘‘We won
most of the draws, and if we could

more trouble in the second set, losing

the season.

Daly said he was pleased with the
performance of goalie John DiDuro,
who was under constant pressure. He
was scored on 16 times, while UNC
had 64 shots on goal. In comparison,
Duke took only 41 shots last week.

Senior Rich Schoenberg was nam-
ed player of the game.

In the fourth quarter, Daly pulled
many of his starters off the field and
let the younger team members have

6-1. McLeod showed composure and
came back to win the second set, 6-3.
The third set went back and forth
before reaching a tiebreaker. Mc-
Leod’s opponent, Tim Mitchell, was
down 2-6 in the breaker before storm-
ing back to take the tiebreker and the
match.

McLeod emphasized the pressure
that was placed on the W&L doubles
teams as a result of the 4-2 deficit
heading into the doubles. “If I had
won my match, there wouldn’t have
been so much pressure on us going in-
to the doubles, but I’ve been down
match points before and won. I just
hope it doesn’t happen again,” he

said.

Despite the pressure, though, the
Generals appeared unaffected in the
early going of the doubles matches.
Each of the three teams took their
Bloomsburg opponents to tiebreak-
ers. The Generals won those break-

a chance because the Tar Heels were
up by 10 goals. This allowed fresh-
man John Knight to score his first
collegiate goal. Other goals were
tallied by Rod Santomassimo, Brown
and G.T. Corrigan.

ers at No. 2 (Haring-Wiman) and at
No. 3 (Mize-Adams. Messerly and
McLeod at No. 1 lost in their tie-
breaker.

Both the No. 1 and the No. 3 teams
again went to tiebreakers. But both
lost those tiebreakers, the loss at No.
1 securing the team victory for
Bloomsburg. The match at No. 3 was
left as a draw due to darkness, while
Haring and Wiman lost the final two
sets of their match to close out the
team scoring.

Coach Franke praised the play of
Bloomsburg and was honest about
the play of his own team. ‘“‘They were
just a little better today than we
were. You can’t make excuses.
You've got to win those close
games,’ he said. For spectators,
Tuesday’s match was like a good
book that you can’t put down. Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, the ending
was a frustrating one.

The Generals finish the week with
three matches in four days. A key
match toward a top Division III rank-
ing will be Friday’s home match
against Rochester. Match time is 3

_ Some, .— _ but apparently, not,

dents missed Fancy Dress last

But one group of students that

The W&L lacrosse team had to
leave Lexington Friday for Cha-
pel Hill, N.C., and a date of sorts

Saturday afternoon. (The Gen-
erals lost the game, 19-5.)

The away game was scheduled
for last weekend because Fancy
Dress was marked on _ the
University calendar as being the
first weekend in March. This later
was corrected to the second week-
end, allowing for a two-week in-
terval between Washington Holi-

W&L ‘9’ off to ‘bes

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team got off to one of its best starts in
recent years, winning two of its first
three games this week.

The Generals swept a doublehead-
er from Christopher Newport Satur-
day before losing a close one to

Virginia Wesleyan on Monday after-
noon.

Against Newport, W&L needea
three extra innings to win the first
game by thescore of 6-5.

The Generals notched one run in
the first inning when Hugh Finkel-
Stein, who went six-for-eight with a
double, a triple and three runs batted
in on the afternoon, led off with a
Single and scored on a Carter Steuart
Sacrifice fly.

Newport came back to take the
lead in the third when it scored two
runs of W&L starter Kirk Breen on
two hits and one General error, mak-
ing the score 2-1. In the fourth, New-
port stretched its lead to 3-1 thanks to
a walk by Breen and a run-scoring
double.

Things looked gloomy for the Gen-
erals after Newport scored again in
the fifth to go up 4-1. W&L came stor-
ming back, however.

In its half of the inning second
baseman Chuck Nelson reached on
anerror, and Adam Yanez then walk-

Turner doubled, scoring two runs and

From Staff Reports

 

After losing his only returning let-
terman, Washington and Lee golf
coach Buck Leslie can find only one
word to describe this year’s young
squad. That word is inexperienced.”

“We are very inexperienced,”’ Les-
lie, now in his 11th season at the W&L

helm, said.

On March 4 and 5, the Generals
drove to Sanford, N.C., for the NCAA
District III, Division III qualifying
tournament. After the first day, they
had driven their way to ninth place in

’ the 19-team field, and ended up fi-
. nishing 12th after the final day.

The Generals’ low scorer at the

’ tourney was freshman Gist, who shot

an 82 and a 78 for a two-day total

_ of 160. The course was a par 71.

Others who competed included junior
John Wheeler, sophomore Mark Za-
vatsky and freshmen Gary Camp-
bell, Andy Parkey and James

Coach Leslie received a bit of a
shock in January when captain and

’ two-year letterman Turner Fried-

man did not return to W&L.

It was a surprise to me, and I think
it was a surprise to his family,” Les-
lie said. He believes Friedman trans-
ferred to West Virginia University
for personal reasons.

Leslie had expected Friedman to
anchor the otherwise young squad.
Wheeler has been elected the new

captain.
The Generals are competing in the
James Madison University

They open their dual meet season on

me know. Turkey hunting will be ad-
dressed this week.

Spring Turkey Season will open in
April, and there are plenty of areas in
which to hunt. National Forest Areas
and State-owned hunting lands are
available to everyone. Private land
also is available. ,

Maps of the George Washington
and Jefferson National Forests are
available for 50 cents at the Forest
Service Office in Buena Vista. The
National Forests should be safer and
less crowded during this season,
since there are fewer turkey hunters
than deer hunters.

Before you hunt, you must obtain a
Virginia hunting license ($7.50), a
Virginia Big Game Stamp ($7.50) and
a National Forest Permit ($2). Hun-
ting is allowed from a half hour be-
fore sunrise until noon, and only
bearded birds may be taken. Shot-
guns, without buckshot, and rifles
may be used to hunt. Resident hun-
ting licenses can be purchased by col-
lege students from out of state.

You and other hunters will be cam-
oflaged, so know what you are shoot-
ing. Do not shoot at the sound of a
bird calling because it could be
another hunter’s call. I wish every-
one a safe hunt and good luck.

tying run when he grounded out,
making the score 4-4.

Neither team was able to score un-
til the 10th inning, when Newport
broke the ice to take the lead 5-4.
W&L was once again able to come
from behifd, scoring twice to win the
game. White led off the inning with a
single, stole second and scored when
pinch hitter Bill Curtiss singled. Chip
Hutchins then advanced Curtiss
when he reached on an error. A sin-
gle by Chris Militello brought Curtiss
home for the winning run.

Bullpen ace Peter Detlefs got the
win in relief of Breen, who gave up
only two earned runs and six hits
while striking out eight in seven in-
nings.

In the second game, W&L starter
White got off to a shaky start before
his teammates rallied in the later in-
nings to pull away from Newport for
the victory, 9-3.

White walked one batter in the first
and gave up a two-run homer with
two outs. W&L cut the Newport lead
in half in the third inning when short-
stop Alex Sutton singled with two
outs and Finkelstein followed with a
double, scoring Sutton.

W&L entered the fifth inning trail-
ing 3-1 before posting four runs to
take the lead.

Militello walked to start the inning,
Nelson singled and Sutton walked to
load the bases. Finkelstein came
through in the clutch again, tripling
to score three runs and put the Gen-
erals in front to stay at 4-3.

In the sixth, W&L put the game on
ice by scoring four runs on five hits.
Militello doubled and Finkelstein,
Steuart, Curtiss and Clement all sin-
gled in the inning.

Track ‘team’ opens season

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Beginning its defense of the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference title,
the Washington and Lee track team
opens its 1985 outdoor season this
weekend in a three-way meet with
Davidson and Emory and Henry at
Wilson Field.

Leading the Generals this season
are tri-captains Chris Ives, Mark
Pembroke and Chris McGowan. In
addition to the captains, the Generals
possess great depth on their team.
Head coach Norris Aldridge said,

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

The 1984-85 swimming team at
Washington and Lee was the best
W&L’s had since 1978. It was a
season of dedication beyond belief
at times, but for the 13 gentlemen
that made up this year’s squad the
long, hard days were more like
business as usual.

To say that the life of a swim-
mer at W&L is hard would be an
understatement. While 95 percent
of the W&L population is fast
asleep, alarm clocks pierce the
dark silence of 13 bedrooms to
begin a swimmer’s typical day.
The time on the digital clock is
5:53 a.m. By 6:15 each of the
members of the team has report-
ed to the weight room, and it’s
time to stretch. The next hour is
spent lifting individually or as a
group, depending on the day of the
week. There is no alternating
Monday, Wednesday, Friday rou-
tine here; itis every day.

“It’s hard to get up, but it got
easier as the season went along,”’
freshman Darrin Denny said.
‘Sometimes you just say, ‘No,’
but you get upanyway.’”

Most students at W&L find it
difficult to get out of bed for an 8
a.m. class. Try weightlifting at
6:15. I know I would want to say,
‘‘No’’more than ‘‘sometimes.”’

After breakfast come the regu-
lar class schedule - the normal

 

“The secret to our success is team-
work.”’ He also said that W&L has a
lot of athletes who will place in their
events and often places two people in
the same event.

Assessing the Generals’ chance to
repeat as conference champion, Ives
said, ‘‘(Our chances are) very good.
We have a lot of very good indivdual
athletes.”’

The Generals are anxious to start
their outdoor schedule. Junior
Townes Pressler (high jump) said
that he jumps better outside. Press-
ler said, ‘‘The outdoors are more cen-
ducive to a better performance.”

Concerning the meet this weekend,

stuff that you and I do. Then at
3:15 it’s back in to Cy Twombly
Pool to swim. Practice lasts until
6 p.m. (‘some a few minutes ear-
lier, most of the time a few min-
utes later,’’ according to fresh-
man Craig Garneau).

Dinner is next, followed by
homework and finally sleep
around 11 p.m. And it all begins
again at 5:53 the next morning. It
doesn’t seem like a very exciting
day, or year, for that matter. But
to these guys, it’s a way of life.
The sacrifices were obviously
there, but not one is complaining.

“Don’t look at it as a sacrifice
—although we do sacrifice some
things, we gain a lot more,” Gar-
neau said. ‘‘You don’t end up on
the negative side, that’s for sure.”’

When the team stayed in Lex-
ington during Christmas vacation,
the general feeling was that it was
in the team’s best interest. There
were no negative comments. Most
said it would have been nice to see
family and friends for the three
weeks, but they felt they couldn’t
afford to be out of the pool that
long.

The swimmers have been suc-
cessful in the classroom, too.
Coach Page Remillard stressed
the education as much as the free-
style. Both have been successful.

“T learned a lot this year,” said
Garneau. “What you get out of
swimming is an intangible, Get-
ting medals and trophies isn’t

Coach Aldridge said, ‘‘I hope that we
are not overconfident from our
ODAC indoor title.”’

“We beat Davidson indoors, but
they have improved since then,’’ he
added. Aldridge also added that the
Generals are currently nursing a few
injuries that could have an effect on
the meet this weekend. Bill Rhine-
hardt has a pulled hamstring from
the ODAC Indoor Championships two
weeks ago. Two of W&L pole vaulters
are out temporarily: one with the flu
and the other with a hurt ankle.

The field events for this weekend’s
meet will start at 10:45 while the
track events will start at 11:15.

satisfaction and discipline. I’m
not going to nationals, nor am I an
all-American, and I’m not going to

get anything.”

“The end of the season is disap-
pointing and a relief,’’ Denny
said. ‘I’m looking forward to next
season. But right now, I need the
rest.”

For the guys not going the na-
tional championships next week,
they probably have more time on
their hands than they know what
to do with. But Remillard and his
nationals-bound swimmers con-
tinue to work.

At poolside, Remillard agreed
with Denny, that the end of the
season had come at a good time.
They seemed to have had their
fill, but not more than they want-
ed.

“These guys have given every-
thing they’ve been asked,’’ Remil-
lard said. ‘‘Hopefully, 10 years
from now they’ll be as happy as
they are today. They've created a
great environment and I have
been fortunate to be an observer.”

Next week, those swimmers
who will be making the trek to At-
lanta for nationals will see if the
long hours and early mornings
will be rewarded with a strong
team showing. One is safe in
guessing they won’t be under-
prepared.

to have been the case. In the fall, a Clemson cross country runner died
of a heart attack but was found to have traces of an anti-inflammatory
drug (as in numbing, so he wouldn’t feel any pain) were found in his
blood. Sure, the case produced a number of indictments and suspen-

there’s going to be a change and education is again going to become
the most important part of a young person’s four years at school, it’s
got to begin with people like Atchley. The NCAA simply cannot serve
that purpose. It’s overcoming the unfeeling minds of people like those

Vision Quest: Entertaining film,
but conclusion could be stronger

MOVIEREVIEW

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

Lauden Swain has turned 18; he is
a senior in high school; and he’s
decided it was time he did something
real. His challenge is known as a ‘‘Vi-
sion Quest’’ and his story is funny
and entertaining.

Lauden decides that to succeed he
must drop two weight classes and

      

wrestle the state champion at 168
pounds. The trouble with his plan is
that the champion, known as Shoot, is
a gorilla who has not lost a match in
three years. Also, Lauden falls for a
gorgeous hitchhiker who moves in
with his family, and he begins to lose
sight of his dream.

Like all ‘challenge mevies,”’ there
seems to be little doubt whether Lau-
den will succeed or not. And, like all
“high school movies,” there is an
assortment of friends, who fit stereo-
types we can all recognize. Unlike

simple genre movies, though, ‘‘Vi-
sion Quest’? touches, briefly, on
unemployment, broken homes and
alcoholism. At its core, it is a film
about a boy who wants to be a man.

Malcolm Modine is the perfect
Lauden. He is bright, unassuming,
shy and kind of ‘‘dorky-looking.’’ His
best friend, Kuch, is played by Brian
Schoeffling, and he is outstanding.

Moviegoers also will recognize sev-
eral songs from the ‘Vision Quest”’
soundtrack. Madonna and Journey
both have new releases off the sound-
track, and Madonna even performs
in the movie

There are some very moving mo-
ments in this picture. Lauden’s visit
to his grandfather is short, but in
those few minutes, Modine says to his
grandfather what a lot/of us wish we
could. The most stirring moment,
however, comes before the show-
down with Shoot when Lauden’s co-
worker, Elmo, explains why he is
coming to see the match. It is ele-
gantly acted, surprising in this type
of movie.

Unfortunately, at that scene sets us
up for is a big, emotional climax, and
we don’t get it. There is the match,
but the aftermath is hardly as large
as one expects, and this one flaw
alone is enough to dampen the effect
of the rest of this otherwise fine
movie

‘Vision Quest”’ is, nonetheless, en-
tertaining, and you will laugh. If only
the ending would have been a little
stronger

Drama prof stages realistic combat .

As one of the country’s premier
choreographers of stage violence,
Joseph Martinez’s goal is to make
fight scenes as realistic as possible.

In so doing, the Washington and
Lee drama professor says he hopes to
make his audiences and his students
recognize that violence is the very
worst way to settle a conflict.

The author of a book on staging
violence, titled ‘Combat Mime,”
Martinez specializes in the chore-
ography of sword fights. This semes-
ter he is teaching eight drama ma-
jors the fine art of making the sword
fights in Shakespeare’s plays look
authentic. And while he is showing
those students how to parry and
thrust without hurting one another,
Martinez thinks the young actors are
learning another lesson.

“T think the students come to re-
cognize the value of non-violence
through learning how to use the
swords,’ he said.

“If there is a central conflict in a
piece of drama, my aim is to make
that violence so realistic, so vivid,
that the audience is horrified by it,’’
Martinez added. ‘‘I go for the adrenal
reaction but not simply for the sake
of that reaction itself. The more hor-
rible it is to an audience, the more ob-
vious it becomes that such violence is
not a viable option.

“And as far as the students are
concerned, I have found that by
learning how to stage these fights
properly they become more keenly
aware of how easy it is to inflict pain
or to suffer pain. Once they are
aware of that, I believe they come to
view violence and violent actions as
something to be avoided at all costs.’’

Martinez acknowledges that the
trend in stage and screen violence
has been toward more and more
graphic depictions.

“There has been an increase in the
knowledge of how to create violent

scenes without actually doing harm
to the actors,”’ he said. ‘I see stage
and screen violence continuing more
and more toward realism.

“Unfortunately, gratuitous graph-
ic violence is coming to a point where
there will be a backlash from people
who are horrified and disgusted. You
can hardly see a film today without
seeing somebody's head chopped off.
There is no question that much of it
has gone too far.”

Martinez, who has studied sword
choroeeography with Errol Flynn’s
fight choreographer and stunt man,
has choreographed a number of
Shakespeare plays, most recently
working with a Chicago stage com-
pany on the sword fights for ‘‘Ham-
let.”

He suggests that some of the best
new choreography in stage violence
has been in recent ‘‘Star Wars’’
films.

“The laser sword fights are similar
in many ways to the sword fights in

the old swashbuckler movies,’ Mar-
tinez said. ‘In that respect, it’s en-
couraging to see something of a re-
turn to the more elegant, yet still ex-
citing, fight scenes.”

On the other hand, Martinez con- ,
siders the manner in which television
presents violence a growing pro-
blem.

“The difficulty that I see with a.
great deal of TV violence is that the
viewer rarely sees the effects of that ;
violence on the victim. A thug is hit,
but you almost never see the pain
that is caused,” he said. ‘‘TV has a
tendency to paint its heroes and vil-
lians in absolute blacks and whites
without any gray areas. That makes
it easy to be unsympathetic toward
the victim.

“When you desympathize the vic-
tim, when you don’t show the effects
of that violence on the victim, then’
that violence tends to become:
palatable.”’

Pop, rock, R&B, reggae, folk

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic
Hey gang — here’s another

dispatch from the rarified atmos-
phere of WLUR, high atop the third
floor of Reid Hall. Our dj’s have been
strong on Madonna, A Drop in the
Gray, Don Henley and John Fogerty.
Others of note: on the home front,
The Blasters have a new Ip, Hard
Line, full of red, white and blue roots
rock. The Alvin Brothers, Phil and
Dave, are exploring the territory
they charted with their earlier re-
leases. Rhythm and blues are alive
and well, at least on independent
labels, as Nappy Brown’s Tore Up
and Rounder records’ Out of the Blue
anthology prove.

Brown, an early ’50s Savoy records
shouter, is back after a 14-year re-
cording absence with an album show-
casing his still resplendent vocaliza-
tions. The Rounder anthology, which
includes Buckwheat Zydeco, Room-
ful of Blues, Solomon Burke and local
faves The Nighthawks, among
others, is both a fun party album and
a steal at $3.98 list. Fleetwood Mac
has a new album of R&B called
Jumping at the Shadows, recorded
live in Boston in 1969 before they
came to epitomize southern Califor-
nia mellow.

Van Morrison has switched labels,
or more accurately, was dumped
from Warner Brothers’ roster along
with many other fine artists in a
purge last year, and resurfaced with
another fine lp, A Sense of Wonder, a
perfect album for the lazy spring
Sundays ahead. Reggae fans will
want to hear a new Pablo Moses Ip,
Tension, as well as a live ‘‘Sun-
splash” recording from Kansas Ci-
ty’s own reggae stars, The Blue Rid-
dim Band. Moses’ use of the studio
and incorporation of electronics
parallels that of Black Uhuru, and
the Riddim’s Alive in Jamaica
testifies to the universality of reggae,
the Chutzpah of these Americans,
and includes an hilarious tribute call-
ed ‘‘Nancy Reagan.”

From overseas, one of the most in-
fluential bands in England today,
The Smiths, have released Meat is
Murder. Musically more upbeat in
spots than earlier efforts, it is lyrical-
ly as intense as the title would indi-
cate. Lead singer Morrissey is para-
doxically whining and hypnotic, but
his essential honesty is what sticks in

the end. Howard Jones has an import
