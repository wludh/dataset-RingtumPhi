Mardi Gras: ‘Like a W

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

NEW ORLEANS — Debauchery knows
no limits during the blowout that is Mardi
Gras, and more than 100 Washington and
Lee students drove, flew and rode here to
partake of the depravity during last week’s
Washington Holiday.

Mardi Gras is technically the highlight of
a six-week season known as Carnival.

Freshman Brandt Wood, a New Orleans
native and Executive Committee represen-
tative, provides a somewhat more relevant
description. ‘‘It’s a raucous, bawdy display
of bacchanalian revelry that is sometimes
crude, sometimes extravagant, but always
exciting,” hesaid.

Carnival allows the entire city to break
the restraints of everyday life and do
something outrageous. For example, a
uniformed policeman came up during a
parade and asked a student for a beer.

The women in the French Quarter yank up

The migrating minks made their way to
the city of drinking, carousing and
celebrating by trekking through the snow-
filled roads of East Tennessee beginning
the Wednesday before break.

Most W&L students made it to the city
after the animal skin floggings but in time
for the biggest and most extravagant of the
parades — Endymion, Bacchus, Rex and
Commus.

Senior Scott Tilley remembers arriving
at the Audoban Tavern II in uptown New
Orleans, a popular hangout most people
know simply as ‘‘AT2’s.”’

“It was like going into a W&L fraternity
party,”’ Tilley said. ‘‘It was small and jam-
packed — it was shoulder-to-shoulder and
you couldn’t move,’’ he said, adding that
there were ‘‘a ton” of people he recognized
from W&L inthe bar.

&L fraternity party’

W&L students have long showed an in-
terest in Mardi Gras. In fact, it was the
Fancy Dress theme in 1954, 1964 and 1974.

Carnival is officially kicked off Jan. 6
with the ball of the Twelfth Night, which
also marks King’s Day in New Orleans
— the Feast of Epiphany commemorating
Christ’s manifestation to the Gentiles.

The party W&L students headed for in
droves last week has a very old history. The
first New Orleans Carnival began about
1857, but its foundations go back more than
5,000 years to celebrations of the Greeks.
According to New Orleans historian Gasper
“Buddy”’ Stall, the Greeks celebrated the
end of the fierce winter by sacrificing
animals and partying naked in the fields
and being flogged with a whip, made from
the skins of animals, to cleanse them of sin.

Carnival has moved far beyond the hand-
ful of gentlemen that gathered in a room on
Royal Street in 1857 to form the Comus
Organization. Today, there are several
parades with more than 1,000 members and
parade budget of close to $2 million.

Education in the news: the Hill reacts

Elrod: W&L program
meets tough standards

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The ‘‘crisis in American educa-
tion’’ outlined in a recent nationally
publicized report has not been ex-
perienced as severely at Washington
and Lee as it has at other colleges,
according to Dean of the College
John W. Elrod.

The report by the Association of
American Colleges stated that the
liberalization of undergraduate
education in the 1960s has resulted in
a serious devaluation of the bach-
elor’s degree.

Competition for students has led to
a marketplace philosophy in the
undergraduate curriculum, said the
report, presented at the association’s
Feb, 9-13 meeting in Washington,
D.C., which Elrod attended.

“It is a supermarket where
students are shoppers and professors
are merchants of learning. Fads and
fashions, the demands of popularity

and experience should prevail,’’ the
report stated.

As enrollment increased in the
1960s, a structured curriculum gave
way to a curriculum chosen by the
students, resulting ina disjointed,
meaningless, undergraduate educa:
tion, according to the report.

“T don’t think we need to panic,”
said Elrod, who came to W&L in
August from Iowa State University.

This was the third recent report by
a major educational organization to
criticize American undergraduate
education.

‘They all have incommon the view
that the liberalization of require-
ments for graduation in the ’60s and
early ‘70s have had unfortunate con-
sequences,’ Elrod said. Students
across the country are graduating
without basic knowledge in several
areas, he added.

were ever as severe as they were at

coherence of all academic majors
and a yearly assessment of the
General Education Requirements in-
stituted this year.

Aid cuts

could damage W&L

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

President Reagan’s proposed cuts
in federal aid to college students are
misdirected and might cause a
‘mass exodus’? of students from
private to state-supported colleges,
according to Financial Aid Director
John H. DeCourcy.

The cuts would involve placing a
limit of $4,000 on the amount of
federal aid — grants, loans and work
study payments — a student could
receive each year, and would make
families with an adjusted gross in-
come of more than $25,000 ineligible
for all aid except subsidized loans,
which would be harder to obtain.

About 40 percent of W&L’s 350
undergraduates receiving aid
already are over the proposed $4,000
limit, DeCourcy said. In addi-
tion, a number of students receiving
aid would be limited to the subsidized
loans.

Guaranteed position for female on

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A resolution calling on the Ex-
ecutive Committee to appoint a
freshman woman as an ad hoc, non-
voting member of the Student Con-
trol Committee next year if no
women are elected to the position has
been approved by the Coeducation
Steering Committee.

At present, a member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee serves as an ad
hoc member of Student Control
because of the possibility that a mat-
ter before Student Control might in-
volve an honor violation.

“Such a representative should be
appointed in each year in which no
woman is elected to class office. In
other words, we recommend that the
Student Control Committee always
have at least one female represen-
tative,’’ the resolution states.

The committee cited both the need
for women to perceive the system as

being fair and the need to ensure that
the system actually is fair as reasons
for appointing an ad hoc woman
member to Student Control if none is
elected.

“Most simply, we fear that women
confronting as all-male board will not
feel themselves to be confronting
peers....Certainly, visible signs of
fairness are important,” the resolu-
tion states.

The resolution adds that in the ac-
tual administration of the
disciplinary system, Student Control
decides each case on its own merits.
Student Contre] must consider the in-
tention of the person being tried and
whether the person’s actions were
serious offenses or merely examples
of “‘boys-will-be-boys”’ or ‘‘girls-will-
be-girls’’ behavior, the resolution
adds.

“But we cannot dispute the fact
that boys know when ‘boys will be
boys’ more thoroughly than girls do
— and that we cannot assume that
male Student Control members will

know instinctively when ‘girls will be
girls’ applies....Therefore, we feel
that not simply the perception of
fairness, but fairness itself, depends
upon female representation,” the
resolution states.

The resolution also notes that men
and women might have different per-
ceptions of the seriousness of sexual
harassment and verbal assaults
against women.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela Simpson, who chairs the
Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that an all-male Student Control
Committee might have a hard time
understanding how angry women
feel when they are subject to sexual
harassment or verbal abuse. A wo-
man might be better able to under-
stand the seriousness of sexual ha-
rassment, Simpson said.

Student Control members have
said they will handle cases of sexual
harassment, Simpson said. In the
past, there have been some cases in
which Law School women have been

Congress probably will not approve
the cuts as they have been proposed,
he added.

“They'll never get this thing
through, but it’s going to be a tough
fight,’ DeCourcy said. ‘‘It’s not go-
ing to be easy. People ought to write
their congressman.”

Compared with Washington and
Lee's tuition and expenses of about
$11,000 for next year, the lower tui-
tion of state-supported schools such
as the University of Virginia and
community colleges will attract the
students who can’t afford private
schools, DeCourcy said.

A reduced number of students who
can pay for W&L could make the
school ‘‘a very mediocre institution,”
he added.

At the same time, he says, com-
munity colleges would thrive. That,
though, is where the greatest amount
of waste takes place, according to
DeCourcy, who was financial aid

SCC urged

harassed but were unaware that Stu-
dent Control would handle such
cases, she said. If some students are
tried for sexual harassment it could
reduce the incidence of harassment
in the future, Simpson said.

Simpson emphasized that if the EC
accepts the committee’s recommen-
dation, a woman would be appointed
as a non-voting member of Student
Control only in the event that no
woman was elected freshmen class
president or vice president. Although
other colleges in similar situations
found that it was several years
before a woman was elected to a
class office. Simpson said it is not in-
conceivable that a freshman woman
would be elected to class office.

“Unfortunately, the minority posi-
tion of women, their newness in the
community, and whatever sexism is
present on campus, all make it
unlikely that women will immediate-
ly or certainly be elected to class of-
fice,’ the committee’s resolution
states.

1984 graduate Carlton Peebles killed in airplane crash

 

From Staff Reports

 

A former Washington and Lee stu-
dent and his brother were killed last
week when the airplane they were
flying crashed in Southwest Virginia

J. Carlton Peebles, who graduated
from W&L last spring, and his
brother, Christopher Peebles, 18, of
Buena Vista, were the only occupants
of the single-engine Cessna 182

Carlton Peebles, 23, was flying
Christopher to the Webb School in
Tennessee when the crash occurred
He’d had his pilot’s license for about
five years, his father said.

The plane took off from Manassas,
in Northern Virginia, at 6:45 a.m
Feb. 19 for Shelbyville, Tenn., accor
ding to Lt. Col. Ethel Hazelrigg of
the West Virginia Civil Air Patrol,
which coordinated the search for the
plane

That after ar

search began

emergency locator transmitter
signal was picked up about 9:20 a.m.
Tuesday. The battery-powered sig-
nal, which serves as a direction
finder, is automatically transmitted
when a plane is involved in a crash.

Because of bad weather, the Civil
Air Patrol was only able to search on
the ground the first day

The plane’s wreckage first was
spotted from the air about 1 p.m. the
next day, and ground crews reached
the site several hours later. About
40 Civil Air Patrol members and
three aircraft participated in the
search, according to Hazelrigg.

The plane was found about 3,900
feet up the side of Beartown Moun-
tain, a 4,700-foot peak near Burkes

Garden on the Tazewell County-
Bland County border, according to
Walter Stiner, an air safety in-
vestigator for the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board

Stine who has visited the crash

site, said the terrain is mountainous,
but he added, ‘I don’t think it’s any
more difficult than any other place
given the proper ways of traversing
the thing.”

Stiner, based in Atlanta, said he
will be making a report to the Na-
tional Transportation Safety Board
in Washington, D.C., within three
months, and the board will determine
the possible cause of the crash.

Carlton Peebles, a business ad-
ministration major who received a
bachelor of science degree in com-
merce last year, waS a manager
trainee at a W.S. Peebles Co. Inc.
department store in Manassas, ac-
cording to his father, C. Palmer
Peebles of Lexington. The younger
Peebles had been working in
Manassas since graduation.

W.S. Peebles is a family-owned
regional chain of about 40 depart-
ment stores, including one in Buena
Vista. Palmer Peebles is a member

of the board of directors.

While at W&L, Carlton Peebles was
a wrestling letterman for four years
and a tri-captain his senior year. He
wrestled in the heavyweight division.

He also was a Dean’s List student,
a football player and a member of
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.

Peebles’ strength was his leader-
ship, said wrestling coach Gary
Franke, adding, ‘‘He was just a fine
person that had a great love for life
and enjoyed being around people and
people enjoyed being around him.”

During Monday’s Executive Com-
mittee. meeting, President Cole
Dawson asked for a moment of
silence in memory of Carlton. “I
think we should express our sym-
pathy to his family and friends.”
Dawson said.

A funeral for the brothers was held
Sunday at R.E. Lee Episcopal
Church. They were buried in
Stonewall Jackson cemetery.

OPINION

 

EC:
No comment

About this time of year, The Ring-tum Phi usually runs a
midterm analysis of the members of the Executive Commit-
tee, reviewing the feats and antics of the first term and
generally commenting upon its performance. Many students
in the past have enjoyed this adjudication of their peers and
leaders. For some EC members, the midterm review has
—justifiably or not — hurt their re-election chances. For the

~ deserving leaders, the review and public praise were long

overdue.
When the winter term started and students began to look
for the midterm reports, we gathered our thoughts about the

- EC and midterm reports.

The conclusion? For the first time in years, a review of the

- EC is not worth the time and effort. Why? Simply, this year’s

~ committee lacks direction and initiative.

A central feature of past Executive Committees seems to

be lacking in this year’s body: initiative. Few substantive

issues have been undertaken by our leaders this year without
outside prodding. Perhaps this is due to the shadow of change
looming over the University this year as we await coeduca-
tion. Perhaps the zeal we saw in last year’s committee came
from the anxiety surrounding the coeducation debate. Re-

- gardless of the source, initiative simply is not present in this

te

’ year’s group, and its absence is both noticeable and unfor-

tunate.

Consider, for example, the typical Monday night meeting.
There is joking and laughter and more joking and occasional-
ly some serious discussion. Monday’s meeting, for example,
included a 15-minute discussion of what constitutes two-

' thirds of 13. This is not to suggest that governing must be a

somber chore carried out with great diligence and a furrow-
ed brow. On the contrary, there is indeed room for humor and
laughter; however, they should not eclipse the real charge
the EC holds, namely that of sound, serious and substantive
governing.

Issues the EC has touched on, but failed to tackle with the

_ proper follow-ups include:

eThe transition to coeducation. President Cole Dawson said

at the beginning of the year that he wanted the EC’s main

goal to be to ease that transition. Little, if any, substantive
action has been taken in that direction.

*A New York Times article that mentioned honor systems
but failed to include W&L’s. At the Nov. 12 meeting, Dawson
handed out copies of the article and asked members to read it
in preparation for a discussion at the next meeting. The issue
was never raised again.

eThe increase in the drinking age to 21. This will have a
profound effect on W&L social life, particularly with our new,
$600,000 pavilion. The EC, though, did nothing in the way of
expressing its opinion on the issue, even though other student
governments in the state were actively lobbying against it.

These issues range from the trivial to the truly substantive.
Yet they are indicative of an EC that consistantly has failed
to follow through on its discussions and actions.

Not every EC member has failed to measure up. Some
have taken their duty seriously and have represented their
classes well. Unfortunately, they have not had much com-

' pany.

Looking back over the first half of the year, it is difficult to
remember any outstanding feat accomplished by the EC.
Granted, after a slow start, strict control has been maintain-
ed over the funds allotted to student organizations, and the

. EC budget, with any luck, should run in the black.

Because we are not in a position to judge the EC’s enforce-
ment of the Honor System, we can only hope that EC
members have been more punctual and have a better atten-
dance record at closed hearings than at the regular Monday
meetings. One would also hope the level of questioning,

. discussion and decorum is somewhat higher.

We do know that the sacred principle of confidentiality in

’ honor cases has gone out the window. Want to know what

cases have come up lately? Just stick around the C-School
library — you’re bound to pick up some juicy tidbits.

These comments are not personal — they merely reflect
the disillusioning reality of EC performance. It’s painful to
come to grips with the fact that great guys and good friends
have fallen short as leaders, but that’s exactly what has hap-
pened. There’s even the gnawing feeling of betrayal — we us-
ed to be very high on these people, and now find their actions
impossible to defend.

Time still remains for the EC to reconsider its charge and
responsibility. In doing so, perhaps it might realize that it is
not too late to redeem itself. We are not asking for another
“tie issue’’ or a bumbled open hearing, nor are we asking for
action merely for its own sake. Rather, we search for a group
that will discharge its duties in a more serious and substan-
tive manner.

“Look HERE, gru! DOGS wil. BE Dogs I[»
—

a

 

 

 

 

Lighten up: dogs just wanna have fun

MY VIEW

By Bob Kelly

 

“Dogs on campus are becomg a
problem,” stated E. Stewart Epley,
University treasurer, in a memoran-
dum that sent shock waves through
the tightly knit community of dog
owners at Washington and Lee.
Though not a dog owner myself, I
have long noted and valued the
charming presence of W&L’s dog
population on our campus.

It was with considerable indigna-
tion, then, that I read of the Universi-
ty’s plans to “invite the dog warden
onto the campus to impound dogs.”’
Still reeling from its inhumane
undertones, and perhaps more than a
little unsteadied emotionally, I
associated Mr. Epley’s ultimatum
with a larger and more sinister plot
on the part of the University ad-
ministration: First bring in women,
then effectively eradicate the
presence of man’s best friend; begin
systematically introducing things
such as lo-cal cottage cheese and
celery sticks in the dining hall,

dancercise and synchronized swim-
ming in the athletic curriculum...

The implications were indeed stag-
gering and appalling. But after fur-
ther consideration, I came to the
realization that only through a clear
and rational approach to this
“problem” can we begin to deal
responsibly with the questions Mr.
Epley has raised. Here then is my
own analysis of the situation and a
few suggestions. First, let us con-
sider The Problem as presented by
Mr. Epley:

1. A campus mailman was
‘‘jumped.” As hard as I find this to
believe, given the gentlemanly
nature of W&L’s dog population, I
nevertheless think it of little
relevance to our discussion anyway.
Mail carriers thrive on this kind of
abuse. Only when it is raining, snow-
ing, sleeting, or when outside
elements are in some other way con-
spiring against them does their job
take on any kind of adventure or
significance. Besides, with the price
of mailing a letter these days, they’re
lucky they don’t get ‘‘jumped”’ by
more citizens.

2. Damage to campus grounds. So
there are a few holes in the lawn. Soa
few plants have been inadvertantly
pruned. Need I remind anyone of the
considerable quantities of cost-free
fertilizer provided every day by

these dogs in question? Need I re-
mind anyone of the precious link this
service provides in the larger
ecosystem of our University?
Remove this vital link, and we could
be pushing the delicate environmen-
tal stability of W&L over an eco-
logical precipice. House pets of one
sort or another have been littering
W&L’s lawns for generations. Need I
remind anyone of the hallowed
regard every W&L man holds for
Traveller? How do you think it would
have reflected on the University had
Traveller been ‘‘disposed of” after
five days in an SPCA holding shelter?

3. Disruption of classes. Mr. Epley
seems to have a point here. Just the
other day, I was on the third floor of
Payne Hall when a Labrador re-
triever pole-vaulted through an open
window and began shouting obsceni-
ties. But this incident, and others like
it, clearly demonstrate that these
dogs are crying out for our help. They
want to learn. And it is our obliga-
tion, nay, our duty, to teach them.

What Is To Be Done:

Open all classes to dogs. Known
around the country as the last great
institution of higher learning to open
its doors to women, W&L could sig-
nificantly repair its reputation by
becoming the first to educate dogs.
Dogs have a distinct and valuable
position in our society, and their con-

Apathy, stupidity spell death

To the Editors:

The W&L student body has been
plagued by apathy for some time.
Apathy is so commonplace that men-
tioning it again will probably have lit-
tle effect. Now though, our apathy
has caused us to take on a new
characteristic — STUPIDITY. I say
stupidity because we apparently
don’t have the time to care about or
worry over our future.

We are specifically speaking to
fraternity members. We are both ap-
palled and astounded by the number
of fraternity members who are un-
aware and haven't read the ad hoc
committee report on fraternity af-
fairs, a paper detailing ‘‘sugges-
tions’’ concerning the internal affairs
and social life of fraternities.

If these suggestions are enacted,
this report will control the future
vitality and life of W&L fraternities.
The key word here is “‘life.’”” We may
return to W&L in 10 years for a reun-
ion and the most striking change will
be the names of buildings. One may
find Red Quad, Beta Dorm, etc. We
do not mean to single out Red Square,
as all fraternities are going to be af-
fected. Face it, the number of males
at W&L is going to decrease so are
the numbers of fraternities. This
report only accelerates the in-
evitability of the latter.

We will not discuss the merits of
each item of the report here. Let it
simply be known that we are appal-
led. We would encourage all fraterni-
ty members who are interested in
their houses or their social lives to
read the report. We are sure you will
find it as amusing, yet at the same

 

Every time I attempt to ar-
ticulate ‘‘what’’ is special about
Washington and Lee, I fall short,
always deciding that it has a lot to
do with the bond between W&L
people and that it can only be
known — ultimately — through
experience. I had such an ex-
perience recently while with four
other students at a Student Alum-
ni Conference in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Aside from being involved in
‘“Kathekon,”’ and from a couple of
friendships, there was nothing
specifically in common within the
group, each person was from a

 

time alarming, as we did. Once you
have formulated your opinion, come
to the IFC meetings and voice them.
Apathy on this issue is worse than
stupidity.

There are a few ramifications of
the report that we would like to
discuss. The first that arises in the in-
troduction to the report. It basically
states that the purpose of W&L is
scholastic performance and all exter-
nal detriments to this should be held
to a minimum. Granted, academics
are important, but they are not the
sole purpose of W&L. The objective
of this school is to graduate well-
rounded individuals who will be suc-
cessful. This success comes not only
from the classroom, but also through
such things as social interaction and
time management. One must learn to
balance the academic vigor of W&L
with its social demands. This can’t be
regulated. It must be learned.

We came to W&L and were con-
sidered adults and were treated ac-
cordingly. A couple of years later, we
have been reduced to ‘‘quasi-adults”
by this report. It seeks to tell us
when, where, how and with whom we
can socialize. Further, it seeks to
regulate the internal organization
and workings of our fraternities. Ar-
riving at W&L, we were told that the
dictates upon our lives were simply
that we not lie, cheat or steal and that
we conduct ourselves in a manner
befitting a gentleman. We are now
being regulated as if we were
children. The White Book states that
when Lee became President he
“stopped faculty visitation of dorms
and all other clandestine supervision

different part of the country, from
a different fraternity and in a dif-
ferent extra-curricular circle.
But, it was evident in the midst of
so many other students front other
schools, this was more than the
natural one of just having come
from the same.school, and more
than any evident tie within the
other groups. This feeling would
be especially strong when we
would find ourselves trying to ex-
plain, with our various perspec-
tives, what W&L was about —
what ‘“‘we’’ were about, to some-
one from Mississippi State or the
University of Georgia. This tie
among us must have been evident
because we were asked about
W&L all weekend, and it was a
good feeling to answer with some-
one from a completely different
circle.

of student conduct.’’ In its place, Lee
established the positive-though un-
printed rule that every student was to
accept responsibility for his conduct.
Should fraternities be any different?
Again we encourage all fraternity
members to read this report. You
should be able to get a copy from
your IFC represe:itative or fraternity
president. (Hopefully, they have
read the report). Don’t assume that
you have been represented on this
committee. As Jim Cobb said during
a recent IFC meeting, the ad hoc
committee discussed the issues for a
semester and then one person wrote
the report. After reading the report,

tribution in the classroom would be
considerable. Many alumni have ex-
pressed regret that they missed out
on fostering close relationships with
dogs while at W&L. Some of us might
even be working for dogs when we
graduate. Dogs on campus and in the
classroom will provide a broad-based
educational experience in keeping
with the liberal-arts ideals our
University holds dear.

Yet before we can begin reaping
the benefits of this plan, we must all
work together to overcome obstacles
impeding its implementation.

What You Can Do:

1. Overpay your tuition by $1 a
term. The treasurer and his staff will
be so busy trying to credit 1,300
undergraduate accounts that he
won’t have time to press his suit on
the dog issue. By the time he catches
up, it will be too late. Our newly
educated canine friends will be able
to defend themselves.

2. Bark at the mailman. He'll think
he’s hearing things. The next time a
dog jumps him, he’ll be too flustered
to notice.

We are not totally against this

Where’s the meaning?

To the Editors:

We would like to comment on Mr.
Tilley’s editorial (sermon?) in the
last issue of The Phi. For a man who
is ‘‘anything but religious’ he seems
to have rather definite religious
beliefs.

Mr. Tilley stated that if we ‘‘make
Christ’s life our life, then we no
longer need to worry about our life
here and the problems we encoun-
ter.”’ We feel that this attitude mere-
ly rationalizes a person’s inadequate
style of living and does not follow the
teachings of Christ. In addition, this
viewpoint provides a vehicle for
hiding from the real problems of liv-
ing by focusing on the “‘infinite’’ in-
stead of the problems that confront
us today.

Mr. Tilley has either misinter-
preted or misstated the teachings of

Knowing the tie that binds

i crnaps the best articulation of
this “feeling” came toward the
end of the weekend during a
discussion about the recent
suicide. One of the group said that
he had noticed everyone voicing
regret but always followed by
‘‘but I didn’t know him...’’ He said
that we did know him, that we
knew him in the same way we
know each other and everyone
else back in Lexington. We all
chose the same little University
— out of all the other universities
in the world, and once here, we
came, in our own corners, to ex-
perience that special bond. This is
why a student from North Caro-
lina and a student from California
can find themselves, outside of

Lexington, explaining ‘‘their’’
place. This is also why we all

Christ. If anything, Christ wanted us
to pay more attention to the problems
that face man rather than looking
past them toward the “‘infinite.”’

If life, as Mr. Tilley claims, does
not come from ‘‘success, wealth or
Buddha” but from following Christ
then many Buddhists, not to mention

Jews, Moslems and others whodonot ,

believe in Christ, are in for a great
shock. They are condemned to a life
without true meaning, according to
Mr. Tilley.

We suggest that Mr. Tilley should
seriously reflect on his views and
become more in touch with reality.

4 women

named

dorm counselors

From Staff Reports

 

Four women have been named as
freshman dormitory counselors for
next year.

The four were among 23 students
chosen as counselors for 1985-86, the
first year Washington and Lee will
have women in its undergraduate
programs.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert Hunt-
ley said two additional female dorm
counselors likely will be needed.

“We're hoping more will apply,”
he said. “Having men as women’s
counselors or women as men’s
counselors is something we want to
avoid.”

He said that one possibility if there
were a shortage of women counselors
would be for each of the four to serve
as counselor to a larger than usual
number of students.

The women counselors are Kath-
leen Plante, a junior who attended
classes here as an exchange student
from Hollins College last winter and
this fall; second-year law student
Janna Johnson; and first-year law
students Terri Amernick and Dan-
drea Miller.

Junior Ted LeClercq was named to

the new position of director of dor-
mitory activities.

“Our activities will go beyond just
social things,’’ said LeClercq, who
this year founded Delta Graham
Lees.

He said that among his plans are
decorating the dormitories, adding
ice machines to the dorms, broaden-
ing the freshman intramural pro-
gram and having the freshmen spon-
sor events.

The dorm activities director will
have the same privileges as an assis-
tant head dorm counselor.

Junior Tom Mack was appointed
head dorm counselor. Assistant
heads are juniors Christopher
Bleggi, Dan DuPre, David Lewis and
John Lewis.

Returning as counselors are
juniors Pat Ferguson, Pete Ierardi,
Tim Janyska, Chris Komosa, Ken
Lindeman and Corky Mauzy.

Joining them are sophomores
Gregory Barrow, Mathew Laws, Jef-
frey Mandak, Shayam Menon, Edwin
Parkinson, Christopher Talley and
Paul Youngman.

Alternates are sophomores Brian
Fagan, Joseph Krastel, John Lowe,
Jon Miles, Steven Pockrass, John
Riordan and Kevin Weaver.

Law, exchange students to counsel coeds

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

How do you find women up-
perclassmen to be dormitory coun-
selors when you have always been an
all-male school and there are no
women who are upperclassmen?

Washington and Lee has solved this
predicament by recruiting three
women law students and an ex-
change student to be dorm coun-
selors. Second-year law student Jan-
na Johnson, first-year law students
Terri Amernick and Dandrea Miller
and Kathleen Plante, a Hollins Col-
lege junior who had been an ex-
change student at W&L for a year,
were selected as dorm counselors for
1985-1986.

But why would three hard-working,
sane law students want to be dorm
counselors?

Miller said she was a dorm coun-
selor for two years at Grove City Col-
lege when she was an undergraduate.
She enjoyed the first semester at
W&L and wanted to do something to
help the freshmen women assimilate
into the W&L environment, she said.

Amernick said that she was a
sorority adviser as an undergraduate
at the University of Virginia and felt
that she has a background similar to
the women who will be coming to
W&L. She said she also enjoyed her
first semester here.

“T felt like I had taken something
out of the W&L community this year,
and I wanted to put something back
into it next year,” Amernick said.
“That might sound a little corny,”
she added as an afterthought.

Johnson cited both the financial aid

What Will It Mean?

 

 

that being a dorm counselor would
provide and a desire to help the
freshmen women adapt to W&L as
the reasons she decided to become a
dorm counselor.

“I knew that it was going to be
rough for some of the women next
year,” Johnson said.

She said that having been one of a
handful of women living in Baker
Dormitory a year ago, she could
sympathize with the freshman
women who will be a minority next

year. Although no one did anything »

specific to make her feel uncomfor-
table, Johnson said that it still was
difficult to feel at ease in that situa-
tion.

Johnson said her experience as an
undergraduate at the University of
Richmond, where men and women
lived in separate dormitories, also
familiarized her with some of the
problems that can crop up on a
segregated campus.

Miller said she is looking forward
to being a dorm counselor.

“I’m excited about it. I’m not
dreading it by any means. I think the
girls are going to have a good time at
W&L,” Miller said.

“There’ll be a few rough spots,”

Sophomore with highest GPA
given Phi Beta Kappa award

Jeffrey Scott Mandak, a
sophomore from Clifton, N.J., has
been named the winner of the Phi
Beta Kappa Sophomore Award for
1984-85. > s

Presented annually by W&L’s
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the
award recognizes superlative
scholastic achievement among
undergraduates in their first two
years at the University. The award

goes to the sophomore who has at-
tained the highest cumulative
scholastic average through the end of
the fall term of his second year at
W&L.

Mandak is a Robert E.. Lee Re-
search Scholar in chemistry. He was
the winner of two awards a year ago,

Chemistry and the Jim Stump Prize
in German.

she conceded. ‘‘But they’ll be ironed
out.”’

Miller added that she anticipates a
lot of complex problems regarding
the rules and regulations for the dor-
mitories, with such questions as
inter-visitation between dorms being
hot issues.

As for whether being a dorm coun-
selor will cut into her academic time,
Miller said that she usually studies at
home and not in the library so she
will be there if anyone on her hall
needs to talk to her.

“Being a second-year law student
is time consuming. But it doesn’t
mean that you can’t have any other
activites,” Miller added.

“I think it’s going to be great,”
Amernick said of being a dorm
counselor. ‘‘I have the Law School
guys telling me, ‘Sure, I’ll help you
out with it anytime,’ ’’ she said,
laughing.

Amernick said that being a dorm
counselor next year probably will be
a little tougher than it would have
been if the school were not going to be
coed for the first time. She added,
though, that many of the problems
people are anticipating next year
may not materialize.

She said the freshman men who
will be coming to W&L know the
school is going to be coed and will not
have a negative attitude toward the
women.

“As a Law School woman, I don’t
think the guys look down on us or
anything like that,’’ Amernick said.

“They'll [the women] feel the fact
that they’re a minority. But that
doesn’t have to be totally against
you,”’ she said.

Amernick said that most of the

women who have come to visit the
school this year seem very outgoing
and if they have an attitude of not
worrying about being in the minority
it will not be as big a problem.

The age gap between herself and
the freshman on her hall should not
be a problem, Amernick said.
Although she will not be able to give
them much advice on things such as
what classes to take, Amernick said
she will be able to help them with the
normal problems that women at all
colleges have.

“T want them to look at me as a
friend,”’ Amernick said.

Being a dorm counselor will cut in-
to her studying time somewhat,
Amernick conceded. But she noted
that she usually studies in the
undergraduate library where the
women on her hall could find her if
they wanted to talk to her.

Johnson said she hoped that being
older than the freshman women
wouldnot beaproblem. .,_,,

‘I’m hoping that will prove to be an
asset. I hope they’ll look at me as
someone they can come to for advice.
I might be able to offer an objective
opinion. I’m approachable enough,”
Johnson said.

She added that she did not know if
being a dorm counselor next year
will be tougher than it would be under
other circumstances.

“It’s hard to say whether it will be
tougher. I think it will be different
from other circumstances.”’

She said that she hoped that being a
dorm counselor would not cut into
her studying time.

Plante is studying overseas this
term and was unavailable for com-
ment.

U.Va. honor appeal
denied in open hearing

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

CHARLOTTESVILLE — An
unusual honor case at the University
of Virginia apparently has ended
with the denial of a retrial to a
former student convicted of lying on
a calculus test.

The case of Monique R. Fawcett,
20, of Farmville, differed from most
U.Va. honor cases in that every stage
was open to the public.

Fawcett was convicted in an open
trial — the first in 142 years at the
university — Sept. 30 of lying by
resubmitting the test for regrading,
knowing that the grade on the test
had been increased from 62 to 85.

On Feb. 17, almost a year after she
took the calculus test, Fawcett’s bid
for a new trial was heard by a panel
of five Honor Committee members.
After three hours of arguments and
more than an hour of deliberation,
the panel denied Fawcett’s request.
At least three members of the panel
would have had to approve the re-
quest for a new trial to occur. Neither
the panel’s reasoning nor its vote was
released.

At U.Va., a student can appeal an
honor conviction only if his rights
were denied in the investigation or
original trial or if new evidence is
discovered that would tend to ex-
onerate him.

Fawecett’s appeal was based on five
grounds:

eHer accusers, engineering
students Douglas K. Murray and
Nelson A. Nieves, did not conduct a
thorough investigation and failed to
interview all pertinent witnesses
before confronting Fawcett with the
accusation.

Bradley Saxton, a third-year law
student and a counsel for the ac-
cusers, responded that ‘‘the in-
vestigation was not inadequate. It
was a model investigation.”

¢Fawcett was not told the specific
nature of her accusation until four
days before her original trial in
September. When confronted by
Murray and Nieves on March 29, she
was accused only of “lying on’’ the
test rather than “‘lying by’’ resubmit-
ting the altered test, according to her
counsel, Rolin Bissell, a third-year
law student.

“The accusation is a very impor-
tant statement,” Bissell said. ‘‘On
the basis of the accusation, and not
the jury charge, individuals decide
whether to leave the university and
how to prepare their case.’’

Chris Hockett, the accusers’ other
counsel, said that the written accusa-
tion fulfilled the Honor Committee
constitution and that the accusers ex-
plained the details to Fawcett.

MONIQUE R. FAWCETT
Appeal denied by panel

¢Fawcett was not given a trial date
within three weeks of her accusation,
as is provided by the constitution.

Rob Buell, Honor Committee vice
chairman in charge of trials and one
of two witnesses called during the ap-
peal hearing, said that because the
accusation occurred in late March,
just before exams began, obtaining
counsel was difficult and it would
have been infeasible to hold a trial
last spring.

¢Fawcett’s right to cross-examine
her accusers was abridged because
she was not allowed to do so in the
original trial until almost six hours
after they had testified.

Because of the delay, Susan
Bradley, another of her counsel, said
the cross-examination that did occur
“was, in effect, little more than a
trial formality.”

Hockett responded that the con-
stitution does not stipulate when the
cross-examination must occur and
that Fawcett was magnifying the im-
portance of the delay.

eFawcett was tried under a defini-
tion of reprehensibility — along with
act and intent the requirements for
an honor violation to have occurred
— that did not allow for extenuating
circumstances. The definition in ef-
fect when she was accused, though,
did allow for extenuating cir-
cumstances, argued David Berten, a
third-year architecture student and
another of Fawcett’s counsel.

Because she was not aware of the
possibility, Berten said, Fawcett did
not consider preparing a defense bas-
ed on extenuating circumstances.

The hearing’s other witness, Bobby *
Blue, Honor Committee vice chair-
man in charge of advisers and chair-
man of the original trial, said both
sides were aware of the definition of
reprehensibility that would be used
in the trial and that Fawcett had a
fair trial.

4 students’ property stolen

From Staff Reports

 

Break meant break-ins for four
Washington and Lee students who in
two separate incidents lost posses-
sions to an intruder entering through
a window.

Senior Paul Casey, a resident of
Lee House II, was in town for break
but left for a day and came back on
Feb. 17 to find he’d lost a number of
items, including a K-mart calculator
worth $3, a blow dryer, a razor, two

pairs of mirrored sunshades (one
with wire ear lobes), a shot glass, two
beer glasses, two bottles of beer and
20 tapes worth $100.

Juniors Thornton Brooksbank, Lee
Hollis and Clint Shelton had $1,580 in
possessions, including a color televi-
sion and three stereos, stolen from
their Lexington house during vaca-
tion. They discovered the loss when
they returned early Monday.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said there are no leads in either case.

Chapel Hel

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Selected
scribblings from a notebook taken to
the University of North Carolina dur-
ing break:

Dean Simpson thinks we're bad
(Part 1): The credentials of an after-
dinner speaker were being read off.
She had all sorts of degrees and sat
on dozens of boards and foundations
and so forth. A staff member from
the University of Georgia sitting
across from us muttered: ‘‘Bet she
can’t bakea cake’...

Dean Simpson would die (Part 2):
On UNC exam bluebooks, it says that
if you’re in doubt about the questions,
you should consult the instructor:
‘*He can be found in his office’’....

Fast frat facts: Administrators
think the fraternity houses here are a
mess. The upstairs of most of the
UNC houses look like a combination
of Beirut and Hiroshima...The wall-
to-wall tartan carpet at SAE is a nice
touch. For the letters on the front of

the house, though, they have an ‘‘S’”’
instead of a sigma. Tacky....At Pika,
the brothers all wore navy blazers,
white shirts and red ties for the color
composite. Looks like VMI....Sigma
Chi keeps its cold test file in the
upstairs bathroom....Kappa Sig has a
soda machine in its bathroom
(‘Mountain Dew, please’’)...Klass
Act: KA has a VCR on its downstairs
TV...At UNC, it’s Betas that are
known as “‘the fish’’...Sigma Nu locks
its doors as if it were a women’s
dorm. After looking around, though,
it’s probably not a bad idea...Sig Ep
has a brand new house that looks fan-
tastic. The brothers were terrific, but
a ‘‘Battlezone’’ video game in the
basement? Come on....Why don’t
W&L fraternities have washers and
dryers in the houses’...

‘Who, me? Generalize?’’: A
female assessment: ‘‘All the frater-
nities are Southern, except Chi Psi.
They’re progressive’...

Is this Chapel Hill or High Point?
One fraternity is known as Phi
Gram....At one party, a drug deal
was going on between two people,

neither of whom knew what they
were doing. It was so bad it was ac-
tually boring for one eavesdropper.
The girl probably still thinks she was
buying Tupperware....Drug use is a
lot more visible there than it is at
W&L. One woman visiting from the
University of Georgia observed: “All
my friends who come here drug out, I
mean, like, I’ve tried it too, but that
doesn’t mean I’m hots--t or any-
thing”’..

I wanna party with you: One of our
group said one of his friends had a
pretty intense night the night before.
He and four friends polished off 30
beers, five joints and 10 lines. And
some people worry about mixing
brew and G&Ts....

I thought this sort of thing only hap-
pened at W&L: A guy at one of the
fraternities said this girl had said
she'd stay the night if he’d drive her
back to Durham (15 minutes) in the
morning. He said he didn’t feel like
doing that. I asked why he didn’t put
her on the bus. The immediate
response: “It wasn’t worth $5.50”’....

Let's make a list of things not to do

J-computers ‘wearing out’

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

The computer system donated to
the journalism department in 1980
needs to be replaced, according to at
least one professor.

“The thing’s just wearing out. It’s
more than 10 years old,”’ said Hamp-
den H. Smith III, associate professor
of journalism, in reference to the
computer system once used by the
Newport News Daily Press and
Times-Herald.

The department hopes the Board of
Trustees will approve in May a pro-
posal for an eight-terminal system
independent of the University’s cen-

tral student computer.
Three or four vendors of
newspaper ‘‘front-end’’ systems

have been considered in the search
for a new system, according to
Smith.

The department is looking for a
computer system that allows the ter-
minals to operate either with the
system or independent of it, he add-
ed.

Operating in conjunction with the
system, a terminal would have the
ability to provide statistical codes for
students enrolled in Journalism 203.
Operating independently, as a word
processor does, a terminal would
feature editing capabilities limited
only by the type of disk used.

The old system is currently housed
in the newsroom on the third floor of
Reid Hall.

Students in Journalism 312 use the
computer during the initial stages of
publishing the ‘Lexington Daily
Bugle.”

From Staff Reports

 

A Monday ritual for many
Washington and Lee students is trek-
king down to the post office, opening
their mailboxes and hastily chucking
the Rockbridge Weekly lurking in-
side.

The Rockbridge Weekly is what’s
known as a ‘‘total market coverage”’
publication — rather than selling
subscriptions like a traditional news-
paper, it is sent without charge to
all area residents.

Advertisers like that, but anyone
who stands in the post office for a day
will quickly realize that because
everyone receives the newspaper
doesn’t necessarily mean everyone
reads it. On Monday, many students
were seen following the three-step
routine outlined above.

The newspaper has _ recognized
there may be some waste involved
and has taken steps to curtail it.

This week’s issue of the paper con-
tained a postage-paid reply card in-
viting boxholders to ‘help us to trim
our printing costs by letting us know

 

but they sure weren’t made for hur-
rying’’....

Bar B.S. (Part 1): This girl was
asking me about W&L. I said some-
thing about ‘“‘coeducation”; ap
parently she thought I said ‘Kasey
Kasem.”” “‘Oh, yeah — I listen to
American Top 40, too,’’ quoth Ms.

went up to the person in charge and
said, ‘You did a terrific job of put-

staring at my nametag,”’ she teased.

the-back motion. ‘Girls in North
Carolina are smarter than girls in
Virginia,’ she said. It’s a tough call,

The card invites you to check “‘yes
— please make sure I get The Rock-
bridge Weekly” or ‘‘no — thanks
anyway, but you may stop delivery.”

Assistant publisher Patricia Burch
said the paper is hoping to eliminate
duplication for people who receive
the paper both at home and in their
box and also to avoid inflicting the
paper on people who have no interest
init.

‘““We’ve had a couple of people say
they get aggravated by the paper,”
she said. ‘If you don’t wantit, there’s
no reason we should send it out if peo-
ple are just going to throw it away.”

Burch said one problem with the
survey was that it was inserted in the
paper, so people who don’t want the
paper and instantly toss it had no
chance to see the card.

‘“‘We wanted to send it separately,
but because of postal regulations we
had to put it in inside the paper,”’ she
said.

most of the ones that are discarded

He added, though, that the paper
doesn’t create any special cleanup
difficulties for the post office. “‘We
may have to police the lobby a little
better, but it doesn’t create any real
problems,”’ he said.

Moore said that of Lexington’s
1,350 post office boxes, about one-
third are held by students.

The Rockbridge Weekly says it has
a circulation of 13,000, and Moore
said many of those look forward to
the paper. “‘We get some complaints

said. ‘Once they become accustom-

Burch said the paper has received

Law School applications up 11% |

Applications to the School of Law
at Washington and Lee this year are
up almost 11 percent over a year ago.

That increase is in contrast to
figures indicating a 12 percent
decline in law school applicants na-
tionwide.

As of February 19, W&L had re-
ceived 973 applications for the 120
positions in next year’s entering Law

applications on the same date last
year.

“We are cautiously optimistic at

Kirgis noted that law school ap-

they put a $4,000 cap that doesn’t stop
that stuff at all; it encourages it” by
forcing students to attend communi-
ty colleges.

In addition, some wealthy people
able to pay for their children’s educa-
tion still qualify for aid. The problem,
DeCourcy said, is the use of the ad-
justed gross income as a measure of
a family’s ability to pay.

“Some very wealthy people have
negative adjusted gross incomes,”’

A family with an adjusted gross in-
come of $50,000 and four children in

“These are the things that should —

Under Reagan’s proposals, an ad-

$25,000 makes a family ineligible for
any federal aid other than subsidiz-
ed, indirect loans — usually the
Guaranteed Student Loan. An ad-
justed gross income above $32,500
makes a family ineligible for the

only federal aid that family can

the importance of higher education

Nagendren described her first
week at Southern Seminary as ‘‘one
big daze.’’ Coming from a strict trad-

freshman had never worn a dress or
a swimsuit.

“Even though everybody has been
very friendly, it is kind of odd when

Chief Editor

 

18-year-old _

Nine present and former Virginia
Military Institute cadets have been
subpoenaed to testify in next week’s
drug-dealing trial of former cadet
Jeffrey R. Pack, who is charged with
six counts of distributing the hallu-
cinogen psilocybin.

Since Pack was indicted Sept. 4 by
a Rockbridge County grand jury, his
three attorneys have filed a flurry of
motions, including two separate re-
quests that the indictment be dis-
missed.

Pack, a former VMI cadet who now
lives in Springfield, is free on a
$20,000 property bond. He left VMI
without graduating.

A jury trial is scheduled for March
8.

A pretrial hearing to consider the
defense motions has been set for
Tuesday by Judge Rudolph Bum-
gardner III, chief of the 25th Judicial
Circuit. Pack’s attorneys have asked
that:

eThe judge unseal the minutes of
the special grand jury that invest-
igated local narcotics trafficking last
year.

eThe indictment be dismissed be-
cause of improprieties in the conduct
of the special grand jury.

eThe indictment be dismissed
because of violations of Pack’s due
process rights.

eThe testimony of any of Pack’s
VMI classmates be excluded from
evidence.

A new trial date be set in April or
May since March 8 conflicts with
their schedule and would not allow
enough time for all the motions to be
settled and have the necessary pre-
paration completed if a trial is re-
quired.

Pack’s attorneys are Thomas C.
Spencer of Lexington, Albert J.
Ahern Jr. of Bailey’s Crossroads and

“I was planned to marry my cousin
whom I happen to hate,’’ Nagendren
said. “If I was ever seen talking to
another boy at school I would be out
of school and married in a week.”’

As far as the social life at Southern
Seminary is concerned, Nagendren
said she plans to concentrate on her
studies before taking on a full social
calendar. She is taking a 19-hour
course load that includes calculus,
biology, English composition, Eng-

lish literature, animal science and”

equestrian management. j

‘People here take an education for
granted,’ Nagendren said. ‘‘The
girls here can’t believe I don’t want a
car and a boyfriend. I have gone
through too much to sacrifice my stu-
dies.”

When asked what her major goal
is, Nagendren quickly responded, ‘‘I
need the satisfaction that I did my
best, but eventually I just want to be
like the rest of the girls and go out on
Saturday night.”’

Auditions to be held tonight

Washington and Lee’s advanced
directing class will hold open tryouts
tonight for three one-act plays to be
presented in April.

The tryouts will be at 7:30 p.m. in
the Boiler Room Theatre under the
Old Main Street Mall on Henry
Street.

The plays to be presented are Ed-
ward <Albee’s “The Zoo Story,”

directed by W&L junior Christopher
Carmouche; ‘Bea, Frank, Ritchie
and Joan” by Renee Taylor and Joe
Bolognia, directed by junior David
Marsh; and Peter Shaffer’s ‘‘Black
Comedy,” directed by senior Todd
Jones.

Performances will be April 3 and 4
in the Boiler Room Theatre.

The Ring-tum Phi, February 28, 1985, Page 5

Louis Koutoulakos of Arlington.

Rockbridge Circuit Judge George
E. Honts III, who would usually han-
die the case, transferred the case to
Bumgardner because it was Honts
who impaneled the special grand
jury.

The prosecutor has also been
changed. Henrico County Common-
wealth’s Attorney H. Albert Nance
Jr. has been named special prosecu-
tor since Rockbridge Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John’’
Read may be called to testify in the
pretrial hearing.

Pack has charged Read with “‘mis-
use of the prosecutorial function’’ in
connection with the special grand
jury.

Pack’s indictment consisted of six
counts, each with identical wording,
charging Pack with selling psilocy-
bin (“‘shrooms”’ in street language)
in the city of Lexington in July of
1983.

Pack’s attorneys said in a motion
that the indictment lacked specificity
and that it was impossible for him to
prepare a defense for the individual
counts.

Nance responded on Feb. 12 that
Pack was being charged with six sep-
arate acts of sales to six different in-
dividuals on or about July 19.

Two days later, Pack’s lawyers re-
quested the names of the individual
purchasers. The judge will rule on
that request Tuesday.

The defense attorneys say that part
of the reason they have requested a
delay in the trial is that ‘‘if the defen-
dant is successful in either of the mo-
tions, there would be notrial.”’

Therefore, if the trial were to go
forward, he would need additional
time after the pretrial hearing to pre-
pare a defense.

In the latest Pack document, his
attorneys charge that his indictment
was improperly presented to the reg-
ular grand jury and that the special
grand jury itself was illegally impan-
eled.

“The invocation of this special
grand jury shortly before the election
involving the Commonwealth’s At-

torney’s office is a factor which may
or may not throw some light on the
rather extraordinary procedures
which were invoked in this case,”’ the
motion for dismissal says.

The minutes of the special grand
jury are necessary to determine
whether Pack’s constitutional pro-
tection against self-incrimination
was violated, the motion says.

It added that ‘fundamental
fairness and regard for due process
require that these minutes be unseal-
ed so that the truth may be ascertain-
ed.”

In his November motion, Pack said
Read violated the principle of law-
yer-client confidentiality by disclos-
ing information to the special grand
jury that he had obtained while
meeting with Pack as a private attor-
ney.

The motion referred to Read’s
“warlike campaign against mem-
bers of society who used drugs.”’

Read said in a response that the
Pack document was ‘‘a_ politically
motivated attack against the entire
drug investigation and against me
personally.”

He said Pack was never a client
and that he had been indicted on the
basis of ‘‘testimony of numerous wit-
nesses who stated that he was a drug
dealer at VMI.”

Both motions were sent to the Vir-
ginia State Bar as part of the report
resulting from a Rockbridge County-
Buena Vista Bar Association invest-
igation of Read’s conduct as a prose-
cutor andas a private attorney.

Nance seems to be taking good-na-
turedly his role as a special pro-
secutor in a county across the state
from his home base. In a Feb. 11 let-
ter to Patterson, he wrote: ‘‘As my
tour in Lexington progresses, if you

find I fail to comply with your pro-

cedures please let me know and I will
get in line. Only my girth is substan-
tial, not my ego!”’

The Feb. 20 document requesting ~
14 prosecution witnesses for the jury
trial is signed by Nance but written
on Read’s stationery.

Wilkins: Republicans gaining

 

From Staff Reports

Lexington’s delegate to the
General Assembly spent the 46-day
session trying his wings as the new
whip for the Republican Caucus, and
looking back says he was pleased
with what he was able to accomplish.

S. Vance Wilkins Jr., delegate for
the 24th District, including Lexington
and northern Rockbridge County, is
serving his seventh year in the
House. Wilkins, who heads an
Amherst construction firm, was
elected-to the whip post by his GOP
colleagues.

“T guess the title comes from whip-
ping people into line,” he said, ex-
plaining that he did a lot of person-to-
person work in his attempt to in-
fluence votes and maintain party dis-
cipline. “I twisted a lot of arms,” he
said good naturedly.

Wilkins said that compared with
the work of the Republican whip in
the past, he’d made great strides.
“The year before it was just a title,”
he said, adding that he still had not
measured up to his own goals for all
he'd like to accomplish in the office.

Wilkins said Republicans have sig-
nificantly increased their visibility in
the statehouse in recent years. ‘‘On
votes that are anywhere controver-
sial, we now have some balance,” he
said proudly.

He said he plans to serve as minori-
ty whip again next session, but of-

fered no guarantees. ‘‘I would expect
$0, but politics is no sure science,”’ he
said.

The Norfolk newspapers last
month conducted a poll in which
legislators, lobbyists, state officials
and reporters were invited to rank
the effectiveness of each member of
the General Assembly.

Wilkins was rated 88th in influence
out of the 100 in the House, down from
69th ina similar survey in 1981.

The newspapers reported at the
time that the Joint House-Senate
Republican Caucus had voted unan-
imously not to participate in the
survey.

Wilkins said Republicans objected
to the poll because the GOP is out-
numbered three-to-one in the party
lineup. ‘‘With 34 Republicans and 66
Democrats, you’re never going to get
a fair shake,” he said.

In his role as whip, Wilkins urged
Republicans not to answer the
survey. ‘‘I got them to agree to leave
it alone,’’ he said. ‘‘It was unfair and
biased. There’s no sense _partici-
pating in your ownrape.”

Wilkins said the activity in Rich-
mond continues to make it an ex-
citing if challenging place to work
part of the year. ‘‘It’s really hectic at
times — I had as many as two or
three meetings at once,” he recalled.

He said he would put his aide in one
meeting, his wife in another and he
would attend the one where a vote
was most likely to come up first. The

clout in Virginia’s legislature

three would then play musical meet-
ings, all passing in the hall as they
shifted among the sessions, with
Wilkins “‘literally running across the
hall.”

Wilkins said it’s more important
that he talk to people about key bills
and be in the most important votes
than to diligently vote on every single
issue and not work on the major ones.

“I miss a few votes that way, but I
think it’s for a good purpose,’’ he
said. ‘‘I’ve never missed a session.”’

General Assembly:
85 session recap

In addition to raising the drinking
age from 19 to 21, the 1985 General
Assembly, which adjourned Satur-
day, took the following action on
several other bills of interest:

¢Passed a bill making Rockbridge
County the site of the new Virginia
Horse Center.

Killed in a Senate committee a bill
that would have required drivers and
front-séat passengers to wear seat-
belts when traveling in automobiles.
This bill, which passed the House of
Delegates, would have set a $25 fine
for violation of the law.

¢Passed a bill requiring motorists
to stay in the right-hand lane of
highways except in certain situa-
tions, such as when passing.

Killed a bill requiring the convic-

 

VANCE WILKINS

tion for drunken driving of anyone
with a blood-alcohol content of .1 or
more. The Senate passed this bill, but
the House killed it.

¢Killed two bills requiring hunters
to wear blaze orange clothing while
hunting west of the Blue Ridge.

ePassed a state constitutional
amendment allowing the governor to
run for a second consecutive term,
beginning with the governor elected
in 1989. The amendment must be ap-
proved by the legislature again next
year and by the voters in November
1986. Virginia governors are allowed
to serve more than one four-year
term, but may not serve consecutive
terms.

*Killed a bill that would have re-
quired girls under 18 to receive per-
mission from their parents or either
a judge or a doctor before getting an
abortion.

*Killed a bill for a referendum on
whether Virginia should establish a
state lottery.

Wa&L ‘crowds’ cause some concern

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

If Washington and Lee sports
crowds are notorious for one thing, it
is probably that they simply do not
show up, a fact that bothers athletic
department officials.

“‘Most of the coaches are very con-
cerned,” Athletic Director William
D. McHenry said, ‘‘and the president
is worried as well.”

McHenry also expressed his feel-
ings about the student body’s respon-
sibility to attend sporting events.

“T think it is up to the student
leaders to stimulate interest,” he
said. ‘lam really disappointed about
the disinterest in the basketball pro-

gram. It was the same for both swim-
ming and wrestling.”

Many students can remember high

school basketball games with a
larger crowd than W&L games.

According to Richard Miller, asso-
ciate director of athletics, low atten-
dance is not due to the teams’ perfor-
mances.

“That doesn’t have a thing to do
with it, personally,”’ Miller said, ‘‘In
basketball, when we were [playing
well] it was no different from last
year.”

If that’s not the reason, then what
is?

“We don’t know,’’ Miller said. ‘“‘We
met on this last spring. Nationwide,
Division III athletics is no different.
All Division III schools have this pro-
blem. Basically, why should a fella
come watch a game at Division III
when he can sit at home with a beer
and watch Notre Dame or Michigan?

Why, you even have a better seat,

than the people there.”’

All the same, McHenry said he is
still upset about W&L’s attendance.
He said that he ‘‘absolutely”’ thinks
that the low attendance affects the
teams.

“It’s very disappointing. You
figure these basketball players work
hard all week and then play to 25 or 30
people,” McHenry said.

Miller added that a supportive stu-
dent body ‘‘gives a team a big boost.”

So, what can be done?

Miller said, ‘‘We’ve had promo-
tional stunts, but they’ve gone over
like lead balloons.”’

For instance, the Athletic Depart-
ment scheduled doubleheaders at a
few basketball games in which
women’s colleges were invited to
play preliminary games. In addition,
students at the women’s colleges
have been invited to some athletic

events as guests. These efforts have
been of no help, according to Mc-
Henry.

Some things have worked, though;
the tailgate parties before football
games last fall went over nicely, as
did scheduling the intramural and in-
tercollegiate swim meets together,
McHenry said.

“However, there is such a heavy
emphasis on drinking parties,” Mc-
Henry continued. ‘‘It’s a shame. If
we sold beer, then the crowds would
show, but we won’t do that.”’

McHenry said he hopes that
coeducation will help attendance
because a night at a basketball game
would make a pleasant, inexpensive
date. However, he says it is up to the
student body to show some interest.

“‘T think it is your ultimate respon-
sibility.”

Beaches to Beatles: Glee Club goes West

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

While some Washington and Lee
students were spending the Wash-
ington Holiday in-New Orleans or on
the beach, one group of students went
even farther away — to California.

The Glee Club made its annual tour
over the holiday, spending 10 days on
the West Coast.

From Feb. 15 through Sunday, the
group gave eight concerts in four
cities. The group sang at Disneyland
in Anaheim and also appeared in Los
Angeles, San Diego and Monterey.

 

According to Dr. Gordon Spice,
who directs the Glee Club, all of the
performances went well, especially
the concerts at the Intercollegiate
Musical Council Festival at Loyola
Marymount University in Los
Angeles and-at the Santa Catalina
School in Monterey.

Spice said the group “‘held its own
against the California schools’ at the
festival.

The concert at the Santa Catalina
School was the best performance
during the tour, Spice said. He
credited the ‘‘enthusiastic’’ audience
at the women’s high school with mak-
ing the concert such a success. Their

respouse brought out the best in the
club, he said.

Several members of the group said
that concert was the highlight of the
trip because it was given in front of
about 300 screaming, applauding
young women.

Junior John-Paul Bouffard said the
audience’s reaction reminded him of
a Beatles’ concert because of the
screaming.

Robert Vienneau, the group’s ac-
companist, said the concert was the
highlight of his career as a pianist.
He said he received a standing ova-
tion after performing a solo and then
was presented with flowers and ask-

ed for his autograph at the end of the
concert.

In addition to performing, the Glee
Club toured several popular attrac-
tions, including Disneyland, the San
Diego Zoo and San Francisco, as well
as taking a drive along the Pacific
Coast Highway.

Sophomore Andrew Bouie said,
“What made the trip were the people.
All the audiences, not just the one at
Santa Catalina, were good to sing
to,’”’

Bouffard said the officers made
sure everyone had fun on the tour.

VRB, not EC,
to run meetin
for candidates

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Petitions from students wishing to
run for Executive Committee presi-
dent, vice president or secretary
should be submitted to the Voting
Regulations Board at a mandatory
candidates’ meeting Monday at 6:30
p.m. in the EC room.

The decision allowing the VRB,
rather than the EC, to conduct the
rules meeting for the candidates was
the subject of some controversy at
the EC meeting Monday night.

“The EC shouldn’t conduct an elec-
tion,’’ said sophomore representative
Andrew Caruthers, who had drafted
a set of rules and regulations that had
been tabled for five weeks before be-
ing approved Monday. The new rules
put the power of running an election
into the hands of the VRB, but the EC
still maintains the right to hear ap-
peals to the VRB, which is itself an
arm of the EC.

Some EC members, including
President Cole Dawson, were vocal
in their opposition to allowing the
VRB to run the rules meeting without
EC supervision. After the decision,
however, Dawson said he was satis-
fied with the outcome.

“I was not disappointed,’ Dawson
added. ‘‘This will be a test to see if it
works out well.”

Dawson said he was worried that
some people might show up at the EC
meeting at 7 rather than the VRB
meeting at 6:30, because the EC has
conducted the rules setting meeting
in the past. Also, a student might ap-

“ways of growing and understand-

ing’ basic to an undergraduate
education.

‘While learning cannot of course

take place devoid of subject matter,

how that subject matter is experienc-
ed is what concerns us here,”’ the

report said.

Elrod said W&L’s General Educa-
tion Requirements to a great degree
already meet the standards of the
report. ‘“‘What we have done in our
General Education Requirements is
return to what we had before we
liberalized the requirements,” he
said.

The report’s minimum required
curriculum would include studies of:

eInquiry, abstract logical thinking
and critical analysis — ‘‘the heart of
the intellectual process.’’ Elrod said
this subject is covered by the General
Education mathematics require-
ment. ‘‘That emphasis we’ve got
taken care of. Mathematics, logic,
statistics, computer science — all of
those courses contribute to that kind
of thinking,’’ he added. '

eLiteracy: writing, reading, speak-
ing, listening. Students entering W&L
this year have to take one English
course and two literature courses.

“That’s a wonderful requirement,”’
Elrod said.

eUnderstanding numerical data.
The calculus or computer science re-
quirement covers that subject, Elrod
said.

eHistorical consciousness, The
General Education Requirements re-
quire a student to take four courses
from at least two of the following sub-
jects: history, fine arts, philosophy
and religion, ‘‘A student could get out
of here without having had a course
in philosophy. We’re not as ironclad
about that as the report recommends
we should be,”’ Elrod said.

Fine arts. See above.

*Science. A laboratory science
course now is required at W&L.

eValues, i.e., a moral philosophy
course. W&L does not require such a
course, but they are offered in the
philosophy and religion departments.
At any rate, Elrod said, ‘Teachers
who are serious about their disci-
plines will find it difficult to ignore
the question of values in their
disciplines.”

eInternational and multicultural
experiences. ‘‘I think it’s extremely
important for students to come into
contact with a non-Western culture

while they’re here, and we just don’t
require that,” Elrod said. ‘‘There is a
limit to what you can require, but I
wouldn’t be at all disappointed to see
that added, somehow.”

Study in depth. Elrod said this re-
quirement is covered already by
W&L’s academic majors, but he add-
ed that he would still like to see each
major reviewed to make sure each
student has ‘‘a unified understanding
of what that discipline is all about.”

“We spent the last couple of years
here struggling with these General
Education Requirements,” Elrod
said. ‘I think it’s time now for the
departments to take a serious look at
the requirements for the major.”

“The major should be not just a
potpourri of courses taken in a par-
ticular area, but should be a careful-
ly thought-through, integrated selec-
tion of courses that the entire faculty
ina given department agrees on.”

The report went on to charge pro-
fessors with concentrating on
research at the expense of teaching.

While stressing that university
research is integral to keeping a
sense of discovery on campuses, the
report said the reward system that
professors work under tends to make
them concentrate on research to
achieve recognition within their
fields.

“Central to the troubles and to the
solution are the professors, for the
development that overwhelmed the
old curriculum and changed the en-
tire nature of higher education was

136 Varner Lane

the transformation of the professors
from teachers...to _professianals,
scholars with Ph.D. degrees with an
allegiance to academic disciplines
stronger than their commitment to
teaching.’’

That misplaced allegiance hds led
to less effectiveness in the classroom
as well as a curriculum determined

by a professor’s desire to protett his |

own courses rather than protegt the
needs of an undergraduate educa-
tion, the report said. ”

Elrod said he has not seen, that
trend among W&L professors.

“‘T don’t think we have ever had the
problem here of people ignoring
teaching because of their interests in
research,’ he said, ’

‘“What we want to do is to continue
the tradition that we already have of
the teacher-scholar emphasis at
Washington and Lee. That te we
have teachers teaching our studen
who are professionally active in. their
fields of specialization.”

“That’s what makes Washington
and Lee such a potentially continuing
dynamic institution.”’

Elrod said W&L’s faculty has’ been
responsible in caring for the, cur-
riculum. Evidence of that are the re-
quirements instituted this year. +

“The faculty has, to its credit, held
out the high standards of quality
education all along,” he said. .“‘The
students should appreciate that com-
mitment, the long-standing cofnmit-
ment of the faculty to quality educa-
tion.”’ :

It is only fitting that the weather in
Lexington this week should be sunny
‘and warm, perhaps a good omen as
the 1985 W&L lacrosse season is set to
begin Saturday. The cool breeze on

. teams, however, the break is a
time of intense practice sessions.
The W&L baseball team got to
spend the practice time in
Florida, while the lacrosse team,
ina break with tradition, stayed in

: | Lexington for the week.

“This year’s trip was probably

“"P the most successful one we've had

, yet,” said baseball coach James
Murdock, commenting on the
’ team’s stay in Deerfield Beach.
‘‘We were able to do a lot of quali-
ty scrimmaging and not just busy
r ~=work.”’

The Generals’ scrimmage part-
ner was Florida Atlantic Universi-
ty, last year’s No. 2-ranked NCAA
Division II team, according to
Murdock. The scrimmages work-
ed well, he said, because the
Florida team was willing to work
in controlled situations, whereas
in the past, teams would simply
use the Generals as a tuneup.

Murdock said, ‘‘we

 

but there are too many unknowns to
make any predictions.”

While this year’s team has many
returning players from last year, the
attitude is new. The team slogan is,
“Be the best we can be.’’ No one is
making predictions of going 11-0. As
a matter of fact, no one will make a
prediction. The members of the team
are not putting themselves in a must-
win situation. The attitude is simply
one of giving 100 percent.

Another change is the fact that the
team decided not to travel to Florida
during the Washington Holiday break
this year. Instead they stayed in Lex-
ington for workouts. said Rich Sch-
oenberg, co-captain and the Gen-
erals’ dominant force in the faceoff
circle. “It was different than when
we went to Florida because here we
were with each other 24 hours a day.
We were almost forced to stay to-
gether.”’ (See related story below)

The biggest difference in Generals’
lacrosse ‘85 may be the disappear-
ance of the midfielder from the game
plan. The new look Generals will
sport only offensive lines and defen-
sive lines. This setup allows for a
stronger attack both ways, Daly said.
On Saturday, the Generals have their

pre-set situations, and we could
stop the action when we wanted to
give instruction.”

One drawback to this year’s
trip, Murdock said, was the
absence of former assistant
coaches Jeff Stickley and Maj.
Doug Smith of VMI, both of whom
resigned earlier this year due to
time commitments elsewhere.
The result was a cut in individual
coaching in hitting, but otherwise
the practices went well, Murdock
said, with much of the credit going
to senior co-captains Mike
Jacoby, Bill White and Chip
Hutchins.

Murdock said he has a few pro-
spects for replacements for
Stickley and Smith but that
nothing is definite yet.

Meanwhile, the Generals’
lacrosse team enjoyed unseason-
ably warm weather as_ they
prepared for the upcoming season
by staying at home in Lexington.
Ironically, head coach Dennis Da-
ly said that the warm Florida sun-
shine was one of the reasons why
he felt it would be better to stay in
town. ‘‘I felt it would be better to
get acclimatized with the weather
around here at the start of the
season,” hesaid.

first real chance to use the new game
plan.

“It is important for us to win this
week,’’ Schoenberg said. ‘The fol-
lowing three weeks are very tough
(at U.N.C. and Maryland and Virgin-
ia at home) and this would be a nice
game towin.”

The schedule is a tough one and Da-
ly sees no easy contests. ‘‘The beauty
of our schedule is that we will be
challenged in every game. There are
no automatic wins or losses. If we
play to the best of our ability, we will
beinevery contest.”

The men who could make the dif-
ferences during the season are the at-
tackmen: senior Rod Santomassimo
(22 goals and 14 assists a year ago),
senior Jeff Mason (25 goals, five
assists) and Sandy Brown (11 goals,
four assists). Along with Schoenberg,
these three should provide the prime
scoring punch for W&L. Schoenberg
will look to get things started off right
in the faceoff circle. He won 67 per-
cent of his 296 chances last year

Defensively, the Generals return
with strength in goal with senior John
DiDuro and sophomore John Church
expected to see action. In front, the
W&L defensive line will feature let-
termen senior Marshall Bowden, jun-

ior Chris John and sophomore Bob
Berlin.

Right now, the team is observing
cautious optimism as Daly likes to
term it. And the players and staff
show no signs of losing that caution.
They insist they will take the season
one game at a time and hope for good
support from their fans.

‘‘We just hope the students get out
and come to our games. The schedule
allows for some very exciting com-
petition. Along with supporting us,
students should support all of the spr-
ing sports because of the work that
goes into preparing the teams,”’ Daly
said.

Daly mentioned that the team is
further along this year than last
year’s at this time. He also said this
team is ready to play and looks to a
very exciting season.

Very noticeable in Daly’s office is a
large poster that reads, ‘“‘One man
can make a difference and every
man should try.”’ And that seems to
be exactly where the 1985 lacrosse
team stands.

“The bottom line,’’ Daly said, ‘‘is
that we will have to play together. No
one individual is going to be the dif-

. ference between winning and losing.

We must havea total team effort.”

Swimmers end season,
prepare for nationals

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team brought its regular
season to an end this past week with
two impressive tournament perfor-
mances. They finished second in both
the Tri-State Championships (Feb.
15-17) and the Virginia State Swimm-
ing Championships (Feb, 22-24). This
was the first time the W&L swim-
mers had ever finshed better than
third place in a championship meet
under Coach Page Remillard.

As expected, the members of the
team were very pleased with their
performances and the final outcome
of the 1985 season.

“We didn’t hit a grand slam but we
did very well and everyone is very
happy with the season,”’ Remillard
said.

One of the main goals of last week’s
two championships was to try to
qualify as many swimmers for na-
tionals as possible. Before last week,
only two members of the Generals

had qualified: freshman Eric
Sullivan in the 500-yard and 1,650-
yard freestyle and Tim Stanford in
the 50-and 100-yard freestyle. Follow-
ing the Tri-States and the Virginia
State Championships, the Generals
had raised the number of qualifying
events to 10. Stanford qualified in the
100- and 200-yard butterfly, Bobby
Pearson in the 50-yard freestyle and
the 400- and the 800-yard freestyle
and 400-yard medley relays.

One disappointment was the
elimination of Pearson’s qualifying
time in the 100-yard freestyle due toa
false start.

The team now is down to those
swimmers who reached nationals.
They will compete March 14-16 in
Atlanta. Remillard said in prepara-
tion for nationals, the next three
weeks will be somewhat of a taper,
but hard work will continue. For the
rest of the team, it is a well-deserved
break after working out for — in
many cases — mucn Ot the last six
months.

A bedraggled
non sequitur

...S0 Bob(by) Knight is throwing
chairs, now. And then apologizing
for the act. Hey, really, it’s okay,
Bob, if you overreact occasionally.

Frankly, my first reaction to the
whole bit was laughter. It was a good
show, and perhaps the quickest
three technicals called on record.
But seriously, I don’t think it’s such
a bad thing to get frustrated every now and then. John McEnroe does

it, doesn’t he?

But then Bob apologized for the whole thing. (That’s probably the
difference between Bob and McBrat.) Still in all, Knight’s action was
understandable. The Big Ten is presently mulling the event over, and
will shortly give Knight some sort of punishment, or not.

And let us go back to “understandable.’’ With Knight’s outburst, one
is quickly reminded of another Big Ten boss who was noted for similar
escapades and lost his job because of one particular incident. Is
Knight’s action along those same lines?

I think you have to say ‘‘no,”’ just as I hope Indiana and the Big Ten
will. But then you have to say ‘‘yes,”’ also. No, Bob Knight need not be
asked to leave coaching, and yes, chair throwing should be recognized

as inappropriate court etiquette.

Jud Heathcote, yes, a Knight advocate, probably put it best when he
said, ‘‘This game makes fools of us all.’’ And Knight admitted there
has been a great deal of mental strain for himself, seeing as his
Hoosiers were picked to finish fourth by the preseason polls.

The ultimate conclusion to this bedraggled non sequitur we like to
call a column is that Knight is a winner. Winners deserve to stay
around, Dean Smith once said of Knight that he gets good players, he
wins and he doesn’t cheat. So true. As far as I’m concerned, Knight
can get as mad as he likes. He’s still a winner and a great coach.
Something tells me, though, it’s a lot easier to be effective watching
from the bench than from the locker room...

.... Turning to the Colonnade in this winter sport-spring sport transi-
tion week, the big news — other than proposed FD dates — is the start
of lacrosse this Saturday at home against Duke. With a schedule that
is challenging — in as strong a sense of that word as you can muster —
Coach Dennis Daly’s troops have their collective backs against the
wall to prove that they are worthy of Division I competition. No predic-
tions here, but I’m willing to be made the fool for last May’s column...

....Well, the USFL thrice over is underway and boy, isn’t it ex-
citing?! And gee, how many of us actually watched through the
Generals-Stallions clash until Doug Flutie completed his first pass...to
somebody on his own team? Frankly, the little man may be burned out
with football. One other USFL note: The move to the fall may be the
best thing for the league and fans. Take that for what it’s worth....

....What’s the story with all these salary abitration sagas in
baseball? I can understand Tim Raines perhaps asking for a bit more,
but his getting $1.2 million is silly. The story from Boston — reserve
first baseman Dave Stapleton playing contract games with a $325,000-
a-year salary — well, that’s just out of line. I think it’s time for a
salary ceiling in professional sports just to bring things under control.
Go ahead and keep the incentives, but these six-figure deals for
nobodies indicates to me that the idea of paying people what they’re .
worth has gone all the way out the window...

...Finally, and then there’s the story of Jersey cage prep star who’s
averaging 49.3 points a game. That’s not bad, when you’re coming
from a school that has only 13 boys in grades 10-12, but then that may
be the reason you’re scoring so much...

“Of course, we were lucky,’’ he
said. ‘“‘The weather might not
have been accommodating to us
atall.”

The main reason for not going to
Florida, Daly said, was the falling
of the season opener on March 2,
only a week after vacation. ‘‘I felt
it was essential for us to play
against Division I competition
before we went into the season,
and there just aren’t any teams in
the far South that are at our
level.”’

By staying home, the Generals
were able to scrimmage against

Navy and the Mount Washington
club team in Baltimore.

“We were able to find out not on-
ly our strengths, but our weak-
nesses, something that we can’t
always doin Florida,” Daly said.

In addition to making great im-
provements, Daly said, the team
also managed to gain the unity
that a group trip can create. This
goal was accomplished by having
the team live in the 200-level
“tombs’’ in the Warner Center
throughout the week.

Daly said the Florida trip might
be revived in the future, but that
he had some reservations. ‘‘Too
often, a trip becomes the focus of
a season and not the means to an
end,” he said.

“We had a final team meeting and
when it was done, the guys who didn’t
make nationals left. They should
have been psyched to be finished, but
they seemed somewhat upset,’’ Rem-
illard said.

‘Mentally, they should be lying on
the Riviera, but hopefully their using
this time as an academic recovery
period.”’

“It didn’t feel too good to walk out
of the locker room,’’ said freshman
Craig Garneau. ‘‘I wish things could
be different and I was joining them at
nationals but I am certainly pleased
with the season and the experi-
ences.”

For those swimmers who had to
leave the locker room and clean out
their lockers, they have little reason
to hang their heads, though. They
helped W&L to its best swimming
season since 1977-78. More impor-
tantly to Remillard, they reached all
of his preseason goals. They con-
tributed to the 7-1-1 record that has
the team ranked seventh in the na-
tion. Each member of the team
helped upset Johns Hopkins, No. 4 in
the nation at the time.

But the vacation hasn’t started yet
for those swimmers qualifying for
nationals. Remillard has high hopes
with the championships just three
weeks away.

“We'll be happy if we make the top
15, but we should be in the top 12,” he
said. ‘It has been an enjoyable
season, but it’s not over yet.”

Netters’ long road
to title starts Friday

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

Coach Gary Franke and his
Washington and Lee tennis team be-
gin their quest tomorrow for a spot in
the NCAA Division III national
championships. It is the beginning of
a long journey that includes a trip to
Florida, a journey that Franke hopes
will lead the team back to Lexington,
where the championships are to be
held in May.

But before they reach the cham-
pionships, the Generals have a tough
schedule to go through, beginning
tomorrow against Division I foe Penn
State. As is the case against any Divi-
sion I squad. Franke said, the team
will need to play extremely well to
win. Franke believes that by playing
such teams, the Generals will show
overall improvement and as a result
have greater success in Division III.

And that success is something that
this year’s group could certainly be
headed for. In addition to returning

last season while studying abroad), a

at No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles, a
strong group of freshmen have joined
the team.

Not only are the first years there in
numbers — there are five in the top
10 spots on the team — but also they
are a group with some talent as in-
dicated by the preseason Inter-
collegiate Tennis Coaches’ Associa-
tion poll. The ITCA rankings have
freshmen Jack Messerly and David
McLeod — the top two seeds on the
team — ranked 12th and 23rd respec-
tively. As a doubles team, Messerly-
McLeod was ranked sixth, and the
team, with the top 30 ranking of Mize,
is rated 13th by the preseason poll.

During the spring break, the team
will take its annual trip to Florida,
where opponents will include the
always strong Rollins and Stetson
teams. After the trip, the team will
be faced with what will likely be a
crucial match — in terms of a na-
tional championship bid — against
strong Emory University.

a strong chance of winning the core

by this time the team will be ranking

bid to the nationals, all the moré
