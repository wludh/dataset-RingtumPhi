LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

Big Apple
is job core

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Seniors at Washington and Lee
often are labeled as ‘‘slack,”’
apathetic and a host of other rather
unseemly terms. This time of year,
however, seniors throughout the
campus begin to panic. In fact, many
even begin to get ‘‘on the ball.”

The reason for this usually stems
from parental guidance in the form
of, ‘‘What the hell are you going to do
with your life after you graduate?
Your mother and I aren’t going to
support you for the rest of your life,
you know.”

So the average senior here at W&L,
with his Commerce School degree
nearly in hand, heads off for one of
the big cities to get into a “‘training
program’”’ with one of the larger
banks. Hopefully, that is.

Yet the thought of actually going to
the Big Apple or even Washington,
D.C., can cause many of the ‘‘South-
ern gentlemen’”’ of W&L to break out
into hives. One cannot forget that
these cities are, dare we say, Nor-
thern.

It often helps to know what to ex-
pect in applying for a job with a bank,
investment firm or some other type
of company that deals with money.

Job applications for positions with
monetary institutions usually follow
a set pattern, according to seniors
Bill Brown and Darby Brower.

Brown has decided to stay in the
South and has applied to various
banks in Atlanta, including Bank of
the South, Trust Company Bank and
First Atlanta. Brower, on the other
hand, feels New York is the place to
be and has applied to Bankers Trust,
Morgan Guaranty and Citibank.

The first step, obviously, is to ar-
range an interview. Both Brown and
Brower said the easiest way to do this
is through someone you know at the
bank. Fathers are great at helping
out at this, especially when one of
their fraternity brothers just hap-
pens to be the president of the bank
for which you want to work.

If you know absolutely no one in the
bank, your best bet is to write a letter
to either the personnel or human re-
sources department requesting an in-
terview.

In your letter you should include
both a cover sheet and a complete
resume. After sending in the packet,
you should hear from the bank in

By ANDY HOPPES

More high school seniors applied for admission to
Washington and Lee this year than in any other year in
the school’s history, according to admissions counselor
Bennett L.:Ross.

As of Tuesday morning, the admissions office had re-
ceived 2,605 applications for admission in the fall. Ross
said the University will be accepting applications
through tomorrow, after which any applications receiv-
ed will be returned.

W&L has réceived: f:912"applications from’ men and ~

693 applications from women. In the University’s pre-
vious best recruiting year, 1982, 1,600 applications were
received.

‘“‘We’ve never had 2,605 people apply to W&L. It re-
presents a substantial increase over anything we've
ever had before,’’ Ross said.

With the large increase in the number of applicants
this year, the admissions office now faces the task of de-
termining what the yield — the number of students of-
fered admission who decide to accept — will be this
year. Ross said that in the past the University’s yield
has been in the range of 40 to 50 percent, but last year
the yield was low and W&L took students off the waiting
list to fill openings in the freshman class

“We are definitely concerned about yield,’’ Ross said.

Although the number of offers of admission that will
be extended has not been determined yet, W&L proba-
bly will be more conservative in the number of students
it offers admission, Ross said. This conservative ap-
proach is prompted by factors such as the tightness of
the housing situation, which makes it necessary to
avoid getting too large a freshman class, Ross explain-
ed.

‘Apathybusters’

Kathekon promotes W&L unity, spirit

 

ng 290 berths

He said the admissions office thinks there will pro-
bably be a higher yield among women than men. With
110 spots taken by early admissions applicants, a max-
imum of about 230 spots are left for men and about 60
spots for women in next year’s freshman class, Ross
said.

The number of students who will be extended offers of
admission will be determined after the admissions of-
fice has made its first review of all the applications,
Ross said. So far, fewer than 1,800 of the applications
have been reviewed, he added.

Admissions officers not only are trying to determine
which students are the most qualified for admission,
but also’which students have the strongest interest in
attending W&L, Ross said. Students with W&L far down
their list of preferred schools will have less chance of
receiving an offer than in past years, he said.

The admissions office is placing greater emphasis on
the interview, both to get a better idea of what kind of
person the applicant is and to see how interested the
person is in W&L, Ross said.

Having the prospective students come on campus for
an interview also helps to sell them on W&L, Ross
noted. Recruits sense the enthusiasm students have for
the college by talking to student guides or discussing
the school with an alumnus, he said.

Although no statistics are available yet, by every esti-
mate the applicants are of higher quality this year,
Ross said. Comparisons of this year’s early admissions
students and those accepted through early admission
last year show that this year’s students have higher ver-
bal and math SATs, and a greater percentage of stu-
dents ranked in the top fifth of their high school class,
Ross said.

The admissions office will send out decision letters to
applicants by March 28. Applicants must reply by May
1.

Sophomore
Suspended
for assault

From Staff Reports

 

 

A sophomore from South Africa
has been suspended for the remaind-
er of the academic year for assault-
ing another foreign student and
breaking his nose.

The penalty was recommended by
the Student Control Committee and
approved by the Student Affairs
Committee, a faculty-student com-
mittee that reviews SCC decisions of
suspension or expulsion.

The Student Control Committee
does not release names of students it
disciplines.

The attack took place Dec. 26 ina
Woods Creek apartment, where the
two students were staying for Christ-
mas vacation, according to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John,

The South African student thought
his apartment-mate had used his pan
to cook meat, which is against his
religion, according to Darby Brower,
chairman of the Student Control
Committee.

The suspended student’s religion
‘‘was the most important thing in his
life,”’ said John Sicilian, Student Bar
Association president and a member
of both the SCC and the SAC.

Members of the two committees
took these religious beliefs into con-
sideration when making their deci-
sion, Sicilian said. He added, though,
that there was an ‘element of pre-
meditation.”’

The disciplinary committees also
considered whether a suspension was
too harsh a penalty for a foreign stu-
dent, the members said.

Because of the costs of returning to
this country and the difficulties of ob-
taining a visa, Sicilian said, a suspen-
sion might actually be a ‘de facto ex-
pulsion.”’

‘He did something that was irra-
tional at the time,”’ Sicilian said. Sus-
pension, though, ‘‘puts him ina situa-
tion where he could never attempt to
reach the height that he was at that
point.”’

A round-trip plane ticket from
South Africa to the United States
costs about $3,000, and the average
family income there is $600 a year,
Sicilian said.

The student will be eligible to re-
turn to the University in the fall, John
said,

The Student Control Committee
voted 8-0 in favor of the suspension,
and the Student Affairs Committee

approved it by a 5-4 vote.

Student found dead

 

From Staff Reports

 

Sophomore football player Paul R.
Strange died early Saturday of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound, authorities
said,

Strange, a 20-year-old from Falls
Church, was a Dean’s List student
who planned to major in physics and
engineering. He was buried yester-
day at Arlington National Cemetery.

Medical Examiner Dr. E.V. Brush
ruled the death a suicide. He said
medical tests have not been complet
ed.

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said the body was discovered by one
of Strange’s roommates at 4 a.m. He
said the death occurred at about 3
a.m. The weapon was a .22-caliber ri-
fle.

Strange lived in a Lexington house
with four members of Phi Kappa Psi.
Friends said he attended a Phi Psi
party Friday night.

previous suicide by a Washington

house as last weekend's death, but in

At the memorial service, Universi-

OPINION
June:

Page 2
February 14, 1985

The anniversary

When he returned to Washington and Lee to deliver a nos-
talgic Founders’ Day address last month, former University
President Robert E.R. Huntley touched, too briefly, on the
tradition and history that is Washington and Lee. In passing,
he mentioned the granting of the University’s first charter, in
1782, and the awarding of its first degrees, in 1785 to 12 young

gentlemen.

Accordingly, this year will mark the 200th anniversary of
those first graduation ceremonies. With the hustle and bustle
of a transition between presidents, the anniversary of the
charter in 1982 somehow was overlooked. The anniversary of
the first commencement exercises should not receive the

same treatment.

University administrators apparently are planning to
mark the graduation anniversary in some way. Although this
certainly is a justifiable end, we question their means.

Rather than commemorate the first graduation during the
200th graduation in June, the University apparently plans to
postpone the bicentennial until September. Among other rea-
sons, this would be done in an effort to attract some of the in-
evitable media coverage from the first class of women.

To even consider marking the anniversary of a graduation
at any time other than at another graduation is all but ridicu-
lous. The circumstances surrounding this occasion make it

even moreso:

eThe graduation of the Class of 1985, in June, not Septem-
ber, will be the 200th graduation of a class from Washington
and Lee University. By September, members of that 200th

class will be gone and forgotten.

eThe first graduation did indeed take place in September,
on the second Wednesday of September 1785. This provides
the only justification for holding the bicentennial celebration
in September, but only if it were held 200 years to the day
from the first graduation. This probably would not happen,
though, because most students will not even be on campus by

the actual day.

The controversy, if indeed there is any, about when to cele-
brate the bicentennial of the first Washington and Lee com-
mencement exercises is silly at best. There should be no con-
troversy. To commemorate the bicentennial at any time
other than in June would be a classic case of a good idea gone

awry.

Giving life meaning

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

 

I was stunned when I heard the
news of Paul Strange’s death. I did
not know Paul, but within our com-
munity here at Washington and Lee,
news with such tragic implications
affects each of us deeply. I, too, feela
loss.

We may never know the reasons
behind his action. That is often the
case with suicides. Many times,
though, suicides occur for one reason
— a failure to find a purpose in life.
William Blake put it a different way:
By becoming lost in the finite, we lose
our sense of the infinite.

Our world today is the most relig-
ious in history. Whether the object of
the quest — the thing being worship-
ped — is money, a god, Buddha,
drugs or even academic achieve-
ments, people want something to
give meaning to their lives.

We seek the four ‘‘P’s’” — power,
prestige, possessions and pleasure
—to give our lives a sense of signifi-
cance. Our time on this earth is rela-
tively short — we want it, we need it
to have purpose.

Through the annals of time, this
has been the case — even from man-
kind’s second generation: Cain and
Abel. When Cain slew his brother, the
punishment bestowed by God was not
death, but a fate far worse than death
—a loss of purpose in life. Cain was a
farmer, with fruit from the ground
providing meaning to his life. Upon
his action, though, the ground he till-
ed became barren He was doomed to
wander the land, his purpose taken
away.

but ‘‘religious,’’ I at the same time
am confident that I have found my
purpose and meaning in life. They
have been given to me by Jesus
Christ.

Evidence proves the existence of a
Jesus as a historical figure. And
many of us go a step further and ac-
cept him as a good moral teacher.
But how can we accept him as a good
moral teacher when he claimed to
have dominion over our lives and
destinies, unless we acknowledge
these claims on our lives as well?

He claimed to be ‘‘the way, the
truth and the life.’’ Either we can
acknowledge our faith in these
claims or reject it. As Josh McDowell
put it, we have to accept Christ as
Lord, liar or lunatic.

If we decide to acknowledge this,
and make Christ’s life our life, then
we no longer need to worry about our
life here and the problems that we en-
counter. On the eternal scale, they
somehow seem to lose their signifi-
cance. We can regain our sense of the
infinite. It gives our lives the mean-
ing we so desperately seek.

Christ’s commandment to us is not
to be religious, to follow a list of do’s
and don’ts and to try to get more pos-
itive marks than negative so that we
can make it to heaven. That is the
“religious” view of life.

Rather, he said to love God with all
of our heart, soul, mind and strength,
and to love our neighbor as ourself.
Upon these rest all of the law and
commandments, and in these will
you find life.

So life is not found in drugs, suc-
cess, wealth or Buddha. It’s not even
found in ‘religious’ practices such
as teetotaling and going to church
once a week.

Rather, it is found in loving Christ.
That is how we transcend the finite
mirages of this world to achieve the
infinite security awaiting us. That is
the purpose of life — and what gives
itits meaning.

Lee:

University Historian I. Taylor
Sanders II says that with the advent
of coeducation, he frequently hears
the question, ‘‘What can Robert E.
Lee do for young women?” Dr.
Sanders says we’ll have to stop think-
ing of Lee simply as a role model for
young men, but will have to expand
our view to include other facets of his
‘complete, well-integrated per-
sonality — the nurturing side of
humanity that he picked up from his
mother.”’ Following are excerpts
from remarks by Dr. Sanders to the
Alumni Association’s Lee Day
celebration Jan. 18.

Part 2 of a two-part series.

One hundred years ago, an entire
generation knew Lee as the man who
combined the idealism and roman-
ticism of the Old South with a vision
for a New South based on practical,
industrial development. In time, he
became known as a saintly man,
nearly Christ-like, aloof and duty-
bound — a ‘‘marble man” on his own
distant Olympus. Freeman knew him
as a good man, a simple man; a man

’

 

To the Editors:

Many times over the years I
thought of writing a letter to The Phi
expressing my disgruntled opinion on
the EC or coeducation or any number
of matters, yet I always decided to
reserve my opinions for my friends
and myself.

However, I write now to the W&L
community, not merely on my opi-
nion, but rather on matters I see as
facts (in my opinion, of course),
something that I can speak on with
some authority. For years I have
worked in Evans Dining Hall, the
past two years as student manager. I
have worked in nearly all areas at
the Dining Hall and naturally have
worked a great deal with Wanda Cof-
fey-Bailey. This is what I wish to ad-
dress — not her complaints with the
Dining Hall, but her difficulties with
the administration. Coffey-Bailey
had some legitimate complaints of

sex discrimination, yet when she ap-
proached the administration she was
met with criticism and more discrim-

shrouded in no secrets. Each genera-
tion has found its own Lee. What
about our own fragmented, post-
industrial world, with its emphasis
on over-specialization and its turning
away from self-denial and _ self-
control toward selfish consumerism,
narcissism, self-promotion — in fact,
all those elements of self-fulfillment,
hedonism and craving for leisure and
personal possessions that have
become synonymous with ‘“Yup-
pies?” Is there a Lee worth-the-
knowing for us?

We can know Lee as a complete
human being, exemplifying what the
Greeks called sophrosyne — whole-
mindedness, or moderation. Lee was
not without personal means — his
estate was not a small one — and he
loved elegant things, yet he practiced
what he preached and he lived
modestly in ‘‘comfortable sub-
sistence.”” The engineer, the prac-
tical Lee, who was also the Romantic
idealist, may have been his happiest
when studying Spanish literature. He
was a professional who regretted
that he had not received more of a

ination. The administration, includ-
ing President Wilson, never gave her
complaints serious examination. In-
stead, the administration circled
their wagons of defensive intoler-
ance. Why was she not treated fair-
ly? Why was she harassed and prac-
tically hounded out of her job? Some
charge that she was incompetent.

But from my own experiences and,

from the views of a great many other
Dining Hall employees (students and
full-time staff), I assert that this is
completely false.

Even after speaking with Presi-
dent Wilson, I can not understand
why an objective member of the ad-
ministration could not have earnestly
listened to her complaints, examined
both sides sorting through the half-
stories and charges of both sides
— and reached something approach-
ing a fair solution, Instead, the
administration ignored valid com-
plaints and pushed Coffey-Bailey out
of sight.

Coach seeks lost jacket

To the Editors:

As the week draws to a close and
Washington Holiday approaches, the
W&L baseball team would like to
thank all the faculty, staff and stu-
dents who supported us in our fund-
raising efforts. Your support in our
fruit sale and whiffle ball marathon
is much appreciated. Through your
efforts and those of the team, we
have reached our goal and will be
spending next week in Florida pre-
paring for our upcoming baseball
season. We hope that you continue to
support us by venturing up to Smith
Field to watch us in action.

The team and I, however, would
like the help of the W&L community
in one additional situation. Some
time ago a new baseball jacket was
removed from the stadium equip-
ment room. If anyone has any infor-
mation regarding the jacket, please
contact Murph, the athletic depart-
ment or myself. The Jacket is royal
blue with ‘‘Generals” in white script
sewn on front. Our primary concern
is the return of the jacket. Thank you
for your cooperation, support and
concern.

Method cruel, unusual

To the Editors:

new, non-therapeutic and non-medi-
cal fashion for which their safety and
effectiveness have never been tested.
A catheter is injected into the crim-
inal’s arm. Then a drug is dripped in-
to the plastic tubing which flows into
the blood stream. One drug is an ul-
trashort-acting barbituate, sodium
thiopental, which works on the cen-
tral nervous system. Its function is to
put out the “‘light of consciousness.”

A second drug as specified in prison
memoranda written to carry out new
laws would be a muscle relaxant,
either tubocurarine, a purified form
of the curare used on arrow tips by
South American Indians, or succiny-
choline chloride. Unfortunately, if
the tactile sensory is active from in-
adequate dosage or improper admin-
istration of the thiopental, the con-
scious prisoner would receive a sen-
sation of ‘‘multiple shocks over the
entire body with erratic muscle
twitching followed by acute paralysis
and suffocation,” says one anesthesi-
ologist of the succinycholine chlo-
ride. It all sounds pretty unusual to
me, if not cruel, don’t you think?”’

‘Marble man’ on own Olympus

liberal education, He was a man who
was brave, without bravado. He was
athletic, virile and courageous, yet
he was also compassionate, nurtur-
ing, modest and patient. Graceful
and neat, without being vain, prissy
or conceited, he also was perceptive,
sentimental and emotional. Idealistic
and humanistic, he was practical, in-
dependent and competitive. A high
achiever, he bore failure with grace.
His sense of honor was chivalric
without swagger; his definition of a
gentleman stressed kindness toward
subordinates, rather than the
shallow, material symbols of status.
He was proud, without being
prideful; gentle, without being
passive; devout, without being prig-
gish; and strong, without being
ashamed of publicly shedding heart-
felt tears. He led without being
dogmatic and dominated without be-
ing domineering. A leader who was
no martinet, he guided men in ways
of self-discipline, self-denial and duty
by his own un-selfconscious example.

In the Feb. 7 issue of The Ring-tum

Dean Simpson’s suggestions to the
Executive Committee concerning co-
education. In the article, Mr. Pock-
rass quoted Dean Simpson as saying
that the EC ‘‘must have a common-
sensical attitude’”’ in adjusting to the
differences that coeducation will
bring. Mr. Pockrass went on to state
that ‘Simpson also indicated a need
for the EC to be prepared for ‘girls-

construed as honor violations.” I

The memory of Lee on Traveller
was a common one around post-war
Lexington. So was the scene of the
elderly gentleman with his market
basket, moving through the streets of
town doing his family’s shopping. A
man of war, he ended his life among
scenes of rural domesticity, amid the
ultimate expression of his hope in the
future: a new generation. His hope
for them was simple: to succeed
where his generation had failed.

To know Lee is to know a person
who embodied all those elements of
wholeness that human beings, male
or female, should cherish and
engender in their own lives. Next fall
a new (and for us unusual) genera-
tion of Washington and Lee students
will find much to ponder as it works
out its own living relationship with
Lee. So a toast, one raised in officers’
messes and around campfires during
the late unpleasantness: ‘To the
Ladies. ..and General Lee.”’

tude of the administration react to
complaints that are bound to arise in
future years with coeducation? The
hostile, defensive reaction of the ad-
ministration in answer to Coffey-Bai-

serious problem.

Leash all dogs, or else

To the Editors:

Dogs on campus are becoming a
problem. One jumped a campus
mailman. They are entering build-
ings and making messes. They are
fighting and disrupting classes, dig-
ging holes in lawns and damaging
campus plantings.

Dog owners are reminded that Lex-
ington has a strict leash law. It pro-
vides that dogs are not to be allowed
to run at large; they must be under
the control of their owners or custo-
dians by means of a leash, chain or
rope when off the owner’s property.

Fines ranging from $5 to $25 are pre-
scribed for violations of the ordi-
nance.

Please take notice that the Univ-
ersity intends to invite the dog war-
den onto the campus to impound dogs
running at large. Dogs impounded
will be taken to the local SPCA shel-
ter, where they will be held for a li-
mited period until claimed. Dogs not
claimed after five days may be dis-
posed of.

An Open Statement to University
President John Wilson, Dean of the
College John Elrod, and Professor
Lamar Cecil Jr. (Chairman of the Li-
brary Advisory Committee):

We, the members of Pi Sigma Al-

abandonment of the University Li-
brary’s 24-hour policy is not in the
best interest of Washington and Lee
University. We believe that:

eThe 24-hour policy contributes
greatly to the academic quality of the
University by guaranteeing access to
academic resources and to quiet
places to study ;

eThe 24-hour policy is a unique
aspect of the University that is a
strong selling point for prospective
students;

*The potential monetary savings of
a limited-use policy are far exceeded
by the potential intangible costs of
limiting University Library hours.

We hope that the administration
realizes that the overwhelming stu-
dent sentiment is for maintaining the
aes policy and will act according-

Whenever it rains, Woods Creek
rises, and when the creek rises it
almost invariably floods over the
footbridge to the Woods Creek Apart-
ments, much to the dismay of stu-
dents living there.

And, according to Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent James L.
Arthur, there is little that can or will
be done about it.

“You have to understand that
Woods Creek is a flood area,” Arthur

* » about two weeks and, if you’re one of
‘the favored few, an interview will be
: scheduled.

The first interview, according to

_./both Brower and Brown, is to weed
‘+: out those who stand no chance and to
find out how interested you really are

‘in the business. One problem is that

*. you will have to foot all the bills for
_.:! that first interview. That includes air
‘fare (if needed), hotel reservations
> . and food.

The first interview is a type of
screening in which the interviewer
checks to see if you can back up your
resume, according to Brown. It is a
chance for the bank to see how com-

. mitted you are to working for it.

Tom Pearce, a _ senior from
Alabama who also is applying for
jobs at several New York banks, said

- Southerners are already at a disad-

vantage just by being from the South.
He said that many Northern bank-

tye ing firms are leery of Southerners for

+ two reasons. First, many feel stu-

dents from here cannot handle the

« pressures of the fast-paced life in a

huge city. Second, many Southern
college graduates will go through the

- excellent training programs found in

. the Northern cities and then move

back to the South.
Pearce also pointed out that you

Parker said he thinks that word
processors help people organize their
thoughts.

“Here in this department what
we're interested in is people’s prose
.. getting to say what you mean,” he
said.

With a word processor, a student
can enter his text and read what he
has written. He then can employ the
many editing capabilities to com-
plete his ‘‘orderly thinking,” accord-
ing to Parker,

“It’s as exciting as all get out,’’ he
said.

“T came here knowing how to use a
word processor,’’ added Parker, who
spent two days on one such machine
at the University of Washington,
writing a 350-page dissertation.

“T’ll show anybody how to use the
machines,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ll get them
started.

“Aside from the initial shock, you
get hooked,’’ Parker added.

The room of microcomputers in
Newcomb Hall was a test of the need
for such machines on campus, ac-
cording to Parker.

“‘A political campaign is not an in-
tellectual excercise,” he said, de-
lighting in the understatement.

Instead it’s an excercise in phone
banks, direct mail and shoe leather.
Colvin’s practitioners of all of the
above will have a slightly more re-
ceptive audience in the city than in
the county, he expects.

He explained that because Lexing-
ton has a large academic population,
it tends to have a larger Democratic
vote than Rockbridge County, which
is more conservative. Also, he said
there is a larger black vote in the city
than inthe county.

When Davis officially launched his
campaign in December, an issue that
was raised was whether he could
overcome the liberal label Baliles
and others frequently pin on him.

“‘T would argue they are both mod-
erate,’ Colvin said. ‘‘Davis is more
liberal than Baliles. It’s more a
moderate against a conservative.”’

“T think Virginia is becoming a
moderate state,’’ Colvin said. ‘‘The
old Byrd machine has been largely
dismantled and some elements of it
have come back into the camp of the
moderates.”’

He said the increasingly moderate

~-cast-efthe Commonwealth electorate

is due partially to the increasing im-
portance of the black vote and the in-
flux of new families into Northern
Virginia.

“That’s what elected Robb gover-
nor, and that’s what elected Davis
lieutenant governor,’’ he said.

Virginia’s equivalent of a primary

to campus was across the bridge
along the road to the military science
building. Then some students started
jumping across the creek or crossing
it on stepping stones, Arthur said.
Rather than risk having someone fall
in — and to make getting to campus
easier — a wooden bridge was added
near the Central apartment building.

The original wooden bridge was re-
placed two summers ago witha pour-
ed concrete bridge built by buildings
and grounds workers.

During normal weather the bridge
usually is clear, but when it rains de-
bris often gets clogged underneath it,
making water run over the bridge
and up the embankments on the side
and forcing students to use the larger
bridge.

“The plan was to put ina bridge for
non-flood times,’’ Arthur said, noting
that students can use the other bridge

 

are willing to make a commitment to
living in New York (or whatever city
itis).

In any event, the first interview
usually lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
In about two weeks you will receive a
letter from the bank that will either
give you the old form rejection slip or
ask you back for another interview.

If you can get asked back to this
second interview, you are halfway in
the door. The bank will pay for all
your expenses, from airfare (or gas
money) to hotel reservations, food al-
lowances and cab fare.

The second interview gives the
bank the chance to look you over one
more time and also gives them a
chance tosell themselves to you.

In this interview, you usually will
spend the day with the company. In-
terviews will be scheduled with be-
tween five and eight people in var-
ious positions within the bank, from
vice presidents on down. Often a ma-
jor part of the day will be with so-
meone who has just finished a train-
ing program or is currently in one.

Remember, you must sell yourself
and not wait for them to take the ini-
tiative. All three seniors said you
should prepare for the interview by
learning as much about the company
as possible. Finally, be prepared to
answer the following three questions.
First, why us? Second, why banking?
and third, why are your qualifica-
tions better than some other stu-
dent’s?

“The experiment, in a sense, has
been successful,”’ he said.

Parker remembers when three of
the five machines were in use 24
hours a day during the last weeks of
the fall term.

Currently, the microcomputer
room is locked during the night, but
certain students do have keys and
will open the room at any time.

“Our ideal is for the place to be
open 24 hours a day,”’ Parker said.

The machines are available on a
first-come, first-served basis and can
be reserved for up to three hours.

The University’s five-year plan to
upgrade the student computer sys-
tem includes the addition of micro-
computers to the library, the Com-
merce School, Robinson Hall and
Parmly Hall at a cost of about $900
for each Kaypro II model.

Also, the microcomputers on the
third floor of Newcomb Hall will be
moved toa larger room on the second
floor, allowing space for additional
microcomputers and new computer
terminals.

is the series of mass meetings that is
held across the state to elect dele-
gates to the state Democratic con-
vention in June. Mass meetings will
be held March 31 or April 1.

“It’s really critical to turn out the
vote in the mass meetings,”’ Colvin
said. ‘‘Whichever candidate comes
out of the mass meetings with the
strongest delegation is likely to be
the candidate.”

“Davis is going to win’’ in Novem-
ber, Colvin said confidently. ‘‘But
first he has to beat Baliles.”’

Davis’ assets include the fact that
he is well-known across Virginia
after having run two previous state-
wide campaigns, the professor said.
“Davis has just been in politics
longer,” he said.

He added that Davis, who was a
Marine officer in World War II and
the Korean War, has the strong back-
ing of veterans, an important seg-
ment of the Virginia electorate.

Colvin said the crucial areas for
Davis will be the 10th District in the
Washington, D.C., suburbs (‘‘the
swing or critical district’) and the
Tidewater area, which includes Nor-
folk (‘‘aboom city”’).

“If he can hold on in Tidewater,

win decisively in the 10th District and_

do well in the 3rd and 4th Districts
[Richmond and Tidewater], then he
is a likely winner,” Colvinsaid.

He said Richmond is important be-
cause that’s the home of Baliles.
“That'll be a tough struggle,’ he
said. Davis is the former mayor of
the 4th District’s Portsmouth.

‘Woods Creek: Water over the bridge

in all weather.

Although there are not any plans to
modify the bridge or build a new one,
Arthur said the University will con-
tinue to reinforce the shore near the
bridge, where erosion caused by
flood waters has been a problem.

Although Arthur said the foot-
bridge probably will not be improv-
ed, he noted that paths around the
apartments have been graded and
covered with gravel, replacing the
old and expensive wood bark surface.

Ultimately, Arthur said, he hopes
the gravel will be packed down,
forming a firm surface and requiring
less maintenance.

Arthur said the University also
plans to put gravel on the Chessie
Trail throughout the University’s
property. Much of the trail has al-
ready been covered, and the job will
be finished in the spring.

Princeton.

The students, all members of the
International Club, repeated the per-

CRs hold convention,
draw state candidates

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee’s College
Republicans won one and lost one at
the annual state convention this
weekend: they were named best club
of their size in the state for the second
consecutive year, but one of their
members lost his bid for statewide of-
fice.

W&L and Hollins co-sponsored the
gathering, the first convention to
be held at the just-completed Roa-
noke Marriott Hotel. The two-day
event drew 300 students from 28 clubs
from around Virginia.

A bit of real politicking accompan-
ied the festivities: the five Repub-
lican candidates for lieutenant gover-
nor, the attorney general candidate
and representatives of the two guber-
natorial candidates made appear-
ances, hoping to gain support for
their candidacies in the upcoming
state elections.

Entertainment included a perfor-
mance by W&L’s Jazz Band, directed
by Robert Stewart, at the ball that
followed the convention. :

W&L was named Virginia’s best
medium-sized club, a category that
includes three-fourths of the CR
clubs. The W&L group also walked
away with the award for the best
scrapbook.

Junior Gerald D. Shepherd, whose
bid for statewide office consumed the
attention of the W&L delegation, said
Virginia has the ‘‘most active, best
organized, most effective’ College
Republican organization in the coun-
try.

He said its 6,000 members also
make it the nation’s largest. ‘From
what I gather, it’s amazing the dif-
ference between Virginia and other

states,” he said.

Despite his enthusiasm for the or-
ganization and after campaigning all
year, Shepherd was unsuccessful in
his effort to become second vice
chairman of the College Republican
Federation of Virginia.

He said he’d been interested in
seeking office for several years, and
finally decided that because he “‘had
something to offer the CRs,” he
should run.

Senior Scott Tilley, executive di-
rector of the Federation, was the del-
egate who nominated Shepherd.
‘“‘When it came down to the roll call,
the votes just weren’t there,” he said.

“Our campaign lost a lot of mo-
mentum when the candidate at the
top of ticket pulled out of the chair-
man’s race and accepted the first
vice-chairman’s spot.”

Tilley said that Friday night while
other delegates were ‘‘getting
wasted”’ at the candidates’ hospitali-
ty suites, a few were involved in
“hard-core politicking.”

“We were plugging information
about Gerald’s campaign into a com-
puter,”’ Tilley said. ‘‘We tried all dif-
ferent scenarios. Through these, we
thought the votes were there until the
other candidate pulled out.”’

“After that, we saw there was no
way we could win,’ he added.

Shepherd said that at that point he
decided not to continue his race. ‘‘We
had given it an awful lot of thought,
and decided that we didn’t want a
showdown,” he said.

Tilley nominated Shepherd any-
way, reading the delegates Robert E.
Lee’s definition of a gentleman.
Shepherd received a standing ova-
tion and then withdrew his nomina-
tion.

‘‘We went out inclass,”’ Tilley said.

Arby’s drive-by OK’d

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Arby’s Restaurant plans to open a
drive-by window following approval
by the Lexington City Council last
Thursday.

City Council granted the restau-
rant a conditional use permit for the
window, on the side of Lee Manor.

The permit states that Arby’s may
operate a drive-by window as long as
it does not create inconveniences to
the people of Lexington. Such pro-
blems would include blocking the
sidewalk or backing up traffic on
Main Street, according to Lexington
City Manager John V. Doane.

Doane said if there were document-
ed evidence of any kind of violation of
the permit, the zoning administrator
would revoke the conditional use per-
mit and Arby’s could no longer con-
duct business through the drive-by
window.

Approval came despite questions

raised by City Council members and
a negative recommendation by the
city manager.

Doane had recommended to the
council not to approve the permit due
to the problems that might be caused
by the addition of a drive-by window.

Doane said there was concern
about traffic problems as well as
about the effect of the increased traf-
fie on the elderly residents of Lee
Manor.

Council member Sue LaRue ex-
pressed concern about the extension
of ‘‘police powers”’ to Arby’s employ-
ees in order to maintain the flow of
traffic around the drive-by area. She
also said council should consider that
Arby’s will be spending the money to
construct the drive-by window and
the permit could very well be taken
away.

Clyde Mull, spokesman for Arby’s
at the meeting, said the Arby’s man-
agement is aware of the possibility of
having the permit revoked but said
he felt Arby’s could properly manage
the area.

EC budget healthy,
administrators say

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee’s
budget, which funds 15 student or-
ganizations, is in good shape this
year and is unlikely to result in a
deficit similar to last ye2r’s, accor-
ding to the student and Untv ersity of-
ficials responsible for it.

EC Vice President James White,
who is in charge of the budget, and
University Treasurer E. Stewart Ep-
ley, who oversees the organizations’
funds as they leave the Business Of-
fice, said this week that the EC is
keeping student organizations fiscal-
ly responsible.

“They are all going well and
[White] is doing an outstanding job of
tracking each organization and its
budget,” Epley said.

“The organizations have been in-
credibly responsible with their funds,
compared to last year,”’ White said.
“It’s really a good sign when the Stu-
dent Activities Board is in the
black.”’

The SAB received more money
than any other organization
—$42,450. The nature of the SAB,

revenue on the whim of partiers,
makes it difficult to predict its in-
come, White said.

Only one organization is projecting
a deficit: the Hockey Club, which has
told the EC it expects to finish the
year more than $220 in the red.

Last year both the SAB and the
Mock Convention were $2,400 in the
red, as deficits of all organizations
depleted the $7,000 in the student
body reserve fund and resulted in an
overall deficit of $1,411.

In addition, the speaker sympo-
sium Contact still is paying off a
$15,000 debt it accumulated between
1982 and 1984.

Those deficits prompted White to
call this a ‘‘trial year’’ for the budget.
‘We started out the year wanting to

run a tight ship,”’ he said.

Because of that tight ship, the EC
has been able to spend some of the
$7,200 in its reserve fund, which is
earmarked for deficits or new organ-
izations.

The Film Society was awarded an
additional $200 at the beginning of the
year, and a new publication, The
Journal of Science, was given $550
last month.

The $100,000 distributed by the EC
in the fall came from the student tax,
which is paid along with tuition by
undergraduate and law students.
This year the tax was $100 — $75 for
the student budget and $25 for the stu-
dent activities pavilion.

The EC decided not to recommend
an increase in the student tax for
next school year for several reasons,
White said.

The student tax was raised $5 last
year for the Mock Convention, infla-
tion has been low, and ‘‘we don’t real-
ly anticipate too many clubs going in-
to the red,’’ White explained.

The Board of Trustees approved
next year’s tuition with a student tax
of $100 at its meeting three weeks
ago.

The EC monitors the organiza-
tions’ budgets by having the groups
make budget reports several times
throughout the year. That system en-
countered difficulties early in the
year, when organizations repeatedly
failed to show up at the Monday night
EC meetings to make their reports.

“We did have a communication
problem at the beginning of the
year,” White said. ‘‘([EC Secretary]
Sam [Dalton] had a hard time some-
times contacting some of the peo-
ple.”

That problem was rectified when
the EC put mailboxes in the Student
Center for all organizations, White
said.

“When they do show up, they cer-
tainly have good budget reports and
have stayed on top of their funds,’’ he
added.

Stricter rules proposed
for honor confidentiality

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

Stiffer penalties for discussing
possible Honor System violations or
Executive Committee hearings could
be in store for Washington and Lee
students if a proposed White Book
revision is approved.

According to discussion at Mon-
day’s EC meeting, President Cole
Dawson has asked senior representa-
tive Bob Tomaso to draft a revision of
Section III, Part O of the White Book
concerning the procedure for an Exe-
cutive Committee hearing.

The section currently reads: ‘‘All
information about a possible Honor
System violation or an E.C. Hearing
is considered highly confidential. The
E.C. will take necessary disciplinary
steps against a student who breaks
confidentiality. Possible disciplinary
steps include: a reprimand, removal
of office or position, suspension and
probation.”’

The proposed change reads: ‘All
information about a possible Honor
System violation or an E.C. Hearing
is considered highly confidential.
The E.C. will take necessary
disciplinary steps against any stu-
dent who breaks confidentiality. An
E.C. member may be reprimanded,
placed on probation for one or more
hearings, or suspended from office.

probation, or suspended from the
University.

“The E.C. recognizes that exten-
uating circumstances may exist. The
President of the E.C. shall decide
whether a situation merits extenua-
tion.”’

EC Vice President James White,
filling in for an absent Dawson, re-
commended that the EC vote on the
proposed revision immediately.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers and first-year law repre-
sentative James Crutchfield, how-
ever, argued in favor of passing the
revision to the White Book Revisions
Committee, whose first meeting is
scheduled for March 4.

Caruthers said this was not a pres-
sing issue and asked why the revi-
sions committee was appointed if it
would not have the power to make re-
commendations on all issues.

Crutchfield’s motion to send the
proposal to the revisions committee
was approved 8-3.

The EC does not have to follow the
revisions committee’s recommenda-
tions, but any White Book revisions
the EC approves must be posted on
campus for a week and then approv-
ed again to become part of the White
Book.

Williams, Jackson
given Pinney Prize

Seniors Glen O. Jackson and
Christopher Williams have been
named co-recipients of the annual
Edward L. Pinney Prize.

The prize is awarded by a vote of
the University Council, composed of
students, faculty and administrators.

Awarded for the first time in 1982,
the Pinney Prize was established by
the faculty in memory of the late Ed-
ward Lee Pinney, who was professor
of politics at W&L from 1963 until his
death in 1980. The Pinney Prize re-
cognizes extraordinary commitment
both to personal scholarship and to
the nurturing of intellectual life at
Washington and Lee.

Senior Chris Williams uses the
word ‘‘motivation”’ a lot.

He has good reason to. When you
talk Chris Williams, you're talking
motivation.

“It’s easy to put forth 100 percent
of your effort if you’re sincere,” he
said.

He added that his feeling of caring
for others is attributable to his family
and to his desire to relate to people.
He also said the success of a project
provides reinforcement and keeps
him going.

“‘W&L has allowed me to grow per-
sonally,’’ he said. ‘‘Friends have
helped me develop an understanding
of people and situations.”’

“Since I’ve been here, I’ve chang-
ed,’’ he recalled. ‘‘A lot of my friends
have influenced me and made me
whatIam.”

 

  

He said he hopes this attitude is
helpful to others. ‘‘People see that I
really care and that motivates
them,” he said.

Rockbridgeite can be found in the county in many shapes and sizes.

“‘W&L is small,” he said. ‘“‘As a
result, it enables a student to make

He made a modest reference to

| characteristics such as persistence

and honesty that he has found helpful
in his work here. He added that his
desire for giving allows these quali-
ties to operate fully.

While good moral character is cer-
tainly a key to success in a group

He said he gives his time out of love
for the school and a desire ‘‘td give

“These organizations may give
students a chance to work with peo-
ple, but you must have the initia-
tive,” he said. ‘Some students don’t,
and fail to realize the freedom ahd in-
dependence they have."’ =

Jackson said a freshman can ob-
tain “immediate employment’’ upon
arriving at W&L, and has the chance
to excel academically and personal-
ly. -

He added that because they’re at a
small college, freshmen can really
make a difference if they try, be-

| Rockbridgeite: The

area’s own mineral

 

By CHRIS MUNSEY
Staff Reporter

 

In addition to being the home of
Washington and Lee, Rockbridge
County has another claim to fame.

A unique mineral called Rock-
bridgeite, a phosphate of iron and
manganese, is found along the
flanks of the Blue Ridge Moun-
tains that run through the county.

Rockbridgeite is often found
with purer deposits of iron ore,
and according to geology Profes-
sor Edgar W. Spencer, Rock-
bridge was once the site of a min-
ing industry.

“There was quite an active min-
ing industry over in Buena Vista,
but they ran out of ore, and other
sources of ore opened up,’’ Spen-
cer said.

In the mid-1£00s seven furnaces
operated along the North River,

smelting iron mined from nearby
pits and mines. Rockbridge sup-
plied much of the iron for the Con-
federacy during the Civil War. By
the 1880s competition from more
accessible and purer deposits of
iron ore made the operation of the
mines unprofitable, and the in-
dustry collapsed. Buena Vista and
Goshen retained operating fur-
naces until the 1920s.

D. Allen Penick, a geologist who
works with the Virginia Division
of Natural Resources, says that
Rockbridgeite is a _ polished,
black-green mineral.

“Rockbridgeite can be cut into
beautiful stones and resembles
black jade,”’ Penick said. The
mineral can be used for jewelry,
but has not been marketed com-
mercially. Penick also noted that
the mineral is found in the states
of Arkansas, Alabama, Maryland
and New Hampshire.

fraternities’ ‘Little Sisters’ program

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A two-year moratorium on the
establishment of ‘‘Little Sisters”’ pro-
grams by Washington and Lee frater-
nities was recommended by the Co-
education Steering Committee on
Tuesday.

The committee’s recommendation
would prohibit the establishment of
“Little Sister’’ programs until
1987-1988. A set of guidelines for set-
ting up ‘‘Little Sisters’’ programs
was approved by the committee.

“Little Sisters’’ programs ‘‘consist
of groups of women formally assoc-
iated with a fraternity for social and
other activities without paying dues
or becoming official members,” the
committee’s recommendation states.

Lee Hollis, chairman of the frater-
nities subcommittee that prepared
the recommendation, said the two-
year moratorium was recommended
because the committee feared that
the women in the first two coed class-
es at W&L would establish a social
pattern based entirely on ‘‘Little Sis-
ters” programs that might restrict
the options of future women.

‘“‘We thought it would help the soc-
ial system evolve a little more natu-
rally,’’ Hollis said.

The committee’ recommendation

 

Coeducation:

83

What Will It Mean?

 

 

stated that the extensive develop-
ment of “‘Little Sisters’”’ programs in
the first two years of coeducation
would limit the development of other
organizations created by women and,
“‘at a time when class unity is impor-
tant, these programs might prove di-
visive.”’

Hollis emphasized that the com-
mittee’s proposal was neither a con-
demnation nor a recommendation of
the establishment of ‘‘Little Sisters”
programs after the end of the two-
year moratorium.

‘‘When properly organized, these
programs can provide a structure for
enhancing friendships between male
and female students and offer women
an opportunity to participate in the
fraternity system. They also could
generate good public relations for
fraternities as well as lead to good
fraternity/sorority relations,’ the

committee’s proposal states.

However, the committee ‘warns
that if the program is not properly
run it could place women in a “‘sec-
ond class status.”’ The term “Little
Sister’ itself implies second’ “¢lass
status, the committee notes. ~

Fraternities also might find that
the cost of a ‘Little Sisters’’ program
is high because dues cannot be col-
lected from the women in the pro-
gram to offset expenses. Z

Hollis said he hopes the Interfra-
ternity Council will adopt the’ com-
mittee’s guidelines for the ‘Little
Sisters’ program when setting tip the
program. :

The guidelines recommend. that
“Little Sisters” not be selected
through Rush procedures but
through a sponsor system or by ecom-
mittee or secret ballot.

According to the committee's re-
commendation, ‘‘Little Sisters’
would have none of the privileges or
responsibilities of membership in the
fraternity. They would have no vot-
ing rights, could not take part in the
selection of other ‘‘Little Sisters” and
would not pay any membership fees.

“Furthermore, ‘Little Sisters’ are
not to be used for mandatory house
work. They are not house members,
but invited guests,” the guidelines
state.

z Winning Tuesday night against
Eastern Mennonite by a score of
94-65, the Washington and Lee bas-
ketball team ended its five game los-
ing streak. The Generals are now
12-12 overall and 6-7 in the Old Domi-
. hion Athletic Conference.
“It’s nice to break the pressure,
* but we can play better,” said head
coach Verne Canfield, commenting
on the victory that snapped the Gen-
erals’ dry spell that lasted two and a
half weeks.
Canfield started the team’s five
seniors in their last regular season
, home court appearance. Seniors
Scott Shannon, Lex Fitzenhagen, Da-
* vid Wilkinson, Mike Hudson and Ke-
. vin McClatchy started the game for
the Generals and opened up an early
* lead.
._ With 9:00 remaining in the first
half, W&L led the Royals 24-11. Can-
field took advantage of the large lead
. togive several of his younger players
experience playing together. Sopho-
mores Jeff Harralson, Fred Bissin-
, Ber and Rob Spencer gained much
playing time with freshmen Harmon
’ Harden and Lou Trosch. Although
, Harralson and Harden are starters,
it was important for Canfield to play
* them with the younger players on the
second platoon. ‘“‘They are what we
are looking at for next year,’’ com-
« mented Canfield.
; Leading 37-24 at halftime, the Gen-
érals opened the second half with the
» momentum that they carried into the
, locker room. In a half in which al-
most everything went right for the
- Generals, nothing could go right for
_ the Royals. The referees slapped two
technical fouls on the Eastern Men-
- nonite bench, while the Royals lead-
ing scorer, Leonard Dow, fouled out

If the Generals want to host a quar-

heavyweight Weaver, who is 13-5, is
injured, and Phillips and Mazza de-
cided not to compete, Franke said.

There will be 20 to 30 schools repre-

Sophomore Frank Rembert takes off at the start of
the 100-yard backstroke in Friday’s swimming meet

There were many factors that play-
ed key roles in the William and Mary
tie. Most of all, the Generals only had
three days of practice last week.
They swam against Gettysburg on
Monday (Feb. 4), then Mary Wash-
ington on Friday and on Saturday
William and Mary. This was also the
first time this season the team had a
home meet ona Friday night and had
to travel the next morning for
another meet that day. And finally,
the Indians were fired up. William
and Mary even shaved their bodies
for the meet.

‘*We knew for four days they would
probably shave,’ Remillard said,
“but when we got there the guys just
said, ‘Gee, they really did it!’ ” It
added pressure and I think teams in
the past might not have been able to
takeit.”

“The effect of shaving was more on
themselves, not on us,’’ David Lewis
said. “It was the only thing they
could do to beat us, and it made us
want tobeat them even more.”

While the rest of the Washington
and Lee students are on vacation, the
swimming team will be participating
in the Tri-State Championships and
the Virginia Senior Invitationals. The
Tri-State Championships, are held in
Bryn Mawr, Pa., is a Division III
meet.

“‘Now we must concentrate on our
second goal. Next week will be at-
tempting to finish better than third in
the Tri-State Championships, some-
thing that no other Washington and
Lee team has been able to achieve in
any championship since I have been
here (1979),’’ Remillard said. ‘‘Our
other goal this week is to better our
qualifying times for the NCAA Cham-

finish the season at 7-1-1.

pionships and qualify more swim-
mers.”

Only two members of the team
have qualififed for nationals. They
are Tim Stanford in the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle and Eric Sullivan in
the 500- and 1,650-yard freestyle.
Everyone except Sullivan and Stan-
ford will shave their bodies for the
championships. Remillard explained
that shaving helps the swimmer slide
through the water. But most of all it
is a total commitment, a mental pro-
cess that makes a swimmer want to
do even better than before.

Coach Remillard predicted the
Generals will finish in the top three at
the Tri-State Championships, but
Lewis felt differently.

“T think we could win. No, as a
matter of fact, I think we will win; we
just need to beat Fairmont St. from
West Virginia.”

the Colonnade fall prey, as other institutions have, to such sexually
confused nicknames as Lady Lions or She-Tigers.

But fear not — at least momentarily — Lt. Col. Mark R. Foutch,
deputy director for news media relations in the Pentagon (yeah, real-
ly, y know the big building that sort of looks like home plate), assured
me that there have been females in the U.S. Army who have reached
the rank of general. Foutch explained that in the past, most of those
earning the high ranking were of the nursing ilk(‘‘starting forward for
the Washington and Lee Nurses...’"?). But with increased oppor-
tunities open to women with the Vietnam War, there have been more
women generals. The most recent (Sept. ’84) figures look like this:

AIR FORCE — three current (one nursing related), six retired;

ARMY — three current (one nursing related), seven retired;

NAVY — three current (one nursing related), five retired;

MARINES-— one current, one retired.

So, problem solved, right? A General’s neuter. No sexually confused
nicknames here, right? Well, not quite so fast. The nickname game
still appears wide open from where I sit. I still hear the rumblings for
Lady Generals from the masses, but surely this tag is redundant as
Lady Commodores (Vanderbilt). I mean, we don’t refer to our men’s
teams as the Gentlemen Generals. Other nicknames I could shell out
to you include something leaning toward the military, like WACs. I'll
just toss out something like Generalettes, indeed, a bit too condescend-
ing to say nothing of the fact that it would be better suited to a dance
hall revue than a women’s lacrosse team. One other conceivable title
could be Marthas, but that’s just silly.

There will have to be some artistic renovations as well. A bearded
madman waving a sword might be nice for football and wrestling, but
women’s tennis? Also, Foutch informs me that women generals have
only earned the rank of two-star general because they cannot
(Congress has yet to see fit to give them that opportunity) see combat
duty. Thus, the five-star ring that is currently a part of the W&L logo
would be— at least temporarily — inaccurate.

Just some thoughts for those who decide such things. SID Mark
Mandel says a decision has yet to be reached, so I thought I’d do my
part to inform everyone of the pertinent problems this all-too-touchy

  

...Now for some serious Colonnade notes: Swimmers and wrestlers
deserve all the praise in the world — just super seasons, as the
Twombly team finishes with a dual meet record at 7-1-1 and grapplers
go 12-2-1. More success is deservedly on the way...Special good luck
wish for wrestlers Steve Castle, Brian Lifsted, Larry Anker, Joe
O'Neill and Jeff Dixon as they head to Eastern Regionals this
weekend...Let’s hope hoopsters are rejuvenated after a fine perfor-
mance Tuesday night. I still say the tournament is up for grabs. They
need to learn to win on the road and fast...

...Headline on McPaper Tuesday says, ‘“‘Valvano undecided on
Washburn,”’ and I’m going to be unforgiving on this one. Any clown
who reportedly —we’ll say ‘‘reportedly’’to be nice —Scores 470 on his
SAT’s doesn’t deserve a desk in a high school classroom, let alone a
college classroom...Georgetown, now that they have lost their two in
the conference, is looking very formidable and getting better every
day. You’re not out of line if you call this bunch a Final Four team....

....Finally, talk about the decline of man, first W&L goes coed, now
the Harlem Globetrotters. Or is it Globetrotteresses?

Four Tops to open
‘datey’ FD event;
Count Basie at ball

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page” Editor

The Four Tops and The Count
Basie Orchestra will be the featured
acts at this year’s Fancy Dress Ball,
according to Student Activities
Board Entertainment Director John
Haywood.

The Four Tops will be the main
attraction at the Thursday night con-
cert in the student activities pavilion.
Wild Kingdom will be the opening
act.

Haywood said the SAB is very hap-
py with having the Four Tops as the
main act on Thursday. ‘‘It will be
very similar to Homecoming,” he
said. Fellow Motown greats — The
Spinners appeared at the first pavi-
lion concert held earlier this year.

Haywood said this is the type of act
that will go over well at a ‘‘datey”’
event like Fancy Dress. He added
that the Four Tops are a world-re-
nowned act and have played in such
places as the Kennedy Center and
Carnegie Hall.

This year’s Thursday night concert
marks a shift in emphasis from hav-
ing a big-name act at the Fancy
Dress Ball and having regional acts
perform on Thursday. Haywood said
this is more like the traditional
character of Fancy Dress, where it is
not so much a concert event and
more of an atmosphere in which peo-
ple can wander about Warner Center
to see different types of entertain-
ment.

Playing in the Warner Center Fri-
day night will be The Count Basie Or-

chestra. Even without the late Count
Basie, Haywood said the orchestra
still is drawing rave reviews from
The New York Times.

The other two bands, each alternat-
ing steps in Doremus Gym, will be A-
Train and Otis Day and the Knights.
A-Train is what Haywood describes
as an “up-and-coming rhythm and
blues band’’ from Shreveport, La.
They will play a variety of music,
ranging from R&B to contemporary
soul androck.

Otis Day and the Knights are pro-
bably best-remembered for their role
in National Lampoon’s ‘Animal
House,’’ Haywood said. They will
play a range of Motown and soul
music from the 50s and 60s.

Haywood said that from an enter-
tainment standpoint, this year’s Fan-
cy Dress will be unmatched. He said
the SAB has tried to get a variety of
music for the weekend and feels that
there will be something for everyone
toenjoy.

Haywood added that the SAB has
also learned a great deal about de-
corating Warner Center in the four
years it has been holding the ball in
the area. He said this year’s decora-
tions and visual effects will really
show that. ‘‘This year we will be rais-
ing Fancy Dress to a new level,”
Haywood said.

Tickets for this year’s ball will be
$30 a couple and will go on sale along
with other Fancy Dress memorabilia
on March 4 in Room 109 of the Univ-
ersity Center.

The Ring-tum Phi will publish its
annual Fancy Dress supplement
Thursday, Feb. 28.

‘Poets in South’ features
English professor’s poetry

Dabney Stuart, professor of Eng-
lish, is the featured writer in the cur-
rent issue of ‘“‘Poets in the South,”
published by the University of South
Florida.

The issue begins with an autobio-
graphical sketch in which Stuart re-
calls some early memories of Rich-
mond, where he was born, and in-
cludes selections from each of his
major volumes of poetry.

The portion of the issue devoted to
Stuart concludes with a critical essay
of his work by Barbara Fialkowski, a

poet and director of the creative writ-
ing program at Bowling Green State
University.

Fialkowski compares Stuart to
Wallace Stevens in requiring of the
reader a ‘‘disciplined listening’ and
in seeing ‘‘the creative work as rea-
son for celebration.’’ But she finds in
Stuart’s poetry a warmer tone, a
more conversational voice and a
greater willingness to embrace all of
human experience.

Stuart holds degrees from David-
son and Harvard.

Wednesday night in the Cockpit
is alive and well and attracting
students to capacity levels despite
scheduling changes and competi-
tion from fraternity parties, ac-
cording to officials of the Student
Activities Board.

“Things are just as good, if not
better than it’s ever been in the
Pit,” said SAB Executive Direc-
tor Mike Guerriero. The Cockpit
was suffering at the beginning of
the year due in some part to a
University order to change the
band night from Tuesday night to
Wednesday night.

Guerriero said that the first
three or so weeks this year went
very slowly while people got used
to the change in nights. SAB
Treasurer George Kinkead calls it
a ‘night and day” difference now.

‘“‘Last year we lost $9,000 on
Tuesdays in the Pit,’’ Kinkead
said. ‘“‘Last term we lost $900, and
so far this term we are $100 up.”

According to SAB Entertain-
ment Director John Haywood, the
SAB tries to book a variety of
bands in the Cockpit. ‘‘We try to
provide a combination of musical
tastes and we try to bring in new
groups to the area as well as old
favorites,”’ he said.

The key element to the Pit’s suc-
cess, Haywood added, is the fact
that women from the surrounding
women’s colleges can drive to
W&L every Wednesday night and
know that there will be some type
of social function going on.

“It’s not so important who the
band is as it’s important that
there is a band here,”’ he said.

 

 

Pit Wednesdays alive, well

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi

Dads lead guitarist David Ayers and keyboardist Kevin Pittman entertain
a packed Cockpit last night. Spectators said the Dads are one of the most

popular bands to appear in the Pit.

Although it may not be the par-
ticular band that brings women
down the road, it does make a dif-
ference as to whether people stay
in the Cockpit or leave for frater-
nity parties.

Hollins College freshman Kris
Wilbur said she comes up almost
every Wednesday even if she
doesn’t know which band is play-
ing in the Cockpit. If the band isn’t

very good, she said, then she
leaves to check out the fraternity
parties. But when a band is a good
one, she said she usually sticks
around.

Kim Soos, also a Hollins College
freshman, said she thinks the
Cockpit is a nice place to start out
the evening. ‘‘Nothing else really
goes on here before 11 o’clock or
so, so this is a nice place to go,”’
she said.

While some people view the Pit
as a prelude to fraternity parties,
others see it as an alternative to
them.

W&L sophomore Rob Merritt
said that the Cockpit provides a
better mixture of people from all
over the University and added
that he thinks the Cockpit is an ex-
cellent place for people to get
together and relax from midweek
pressures

Sweet Briar College senior
Maura Horodyski said she prefers
the Cockpit to fraternity parties.
“There is a greater variety of peo-
ple here,”’ she said. ‘‘It’s harder to
get to know people at a fraternity
party where everybody already
knows everybody.”’

Anne Munroe, a freshman from
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege, disagreed with that position.
“T would rather go to a fraternity
party where I know the kind of
people that are going to be there,”
she said.

Hollins College sophomore Sta-
cey Powell tends to see the middle
ground of this area. ‘‘The Cockpit
is great for getting all the frater-
nities as well as the independents
together in one place. It elimi-
nates having to go fraternity hop-
ping,” she said.

Most people said they are happy
with the job the SAB is doing with
the Wednesday night program.
Several complaints were made
about the overcrowding problem,
and a few disgruntled under-age
students said they wished they
could drink beer in the Pit, but for
the most part Wednesday Night in
the Cockpit continues to be one of
W&L’s strongest social traditions.

 

 

‘Real world’ negates Nabobs’ nattering

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Just after the Christmas holidays,
a Washington and Lee Law School in-
stittition was shattered. Following
some heady deliberations and attor-
ney-client discussions, the Nattering
Nabobs of Negativism decided to
break up. The band, formed in Octo-
ber 1983, was made up of five law stu-
dents and one undergraduate,

The rhythm guitarist and lead vo-
calist for the band, Jake Washburne,
said that the decision was based
mainly on the realization that, come
springtime and graduation, it would
be time for graduating law students
to seek some sort of gainful employ-
ment in the “real world.’’ Most law
students, Washburne said, take care
of their job-hunting in the fall. This
fall, however, he was busy with the
band.

“It was so much fun,’’ Washburne
continued, ‘‘that it made it easier to
not think about the future.”’

Toward the end of the fall term he
did begin to think about the future
and raised the point with his fellow
band members and briefed them on
his position. He said that the band
decided to wait until after the holi-
days to make any firm plans.

The Nabobs last performed at the SAB Christmas Concert.

Other Nabobs and _ attorneys-at-
law-to-be are third-year students
John Miller, drummer, and Dave
Hurd and Jerry Farmer, harmony
singers, second-year student Taylor
Abbott, who plays the bass, and Class
of 1985 undergrad Landon Banfield,
lead guitarist.

The band took its name from a
quote that former Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew used to describe the

press. Washburne said that because
he is a Marylander like Agnew and
has been an admirer of the ex-VP
since he had a sticker on his bicycle
as a young lad, he picked the name
and it stuck.

The Nabobs played gigs mostly in
Lexington during their 14-month
show business career. The W&L
Cockpit and fraternity parties were

the best places to catch their act:

locally, although they did make sev-
eral road trips, playing at Sweet
Briar College, Southern Seminary
Junior College and a bar in Roanoke.
Washburne classified the band’s re-
pertoire as 60s rock and roll with a
few newer tunes mixed in.

There is a vague, tentative plan,

Washburne said, for the Nabobs to >

get back together in the spring, after
the law exams are over but prior to
graduation, and play one more time.
