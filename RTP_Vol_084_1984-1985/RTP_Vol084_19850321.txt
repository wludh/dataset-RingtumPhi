W&L, U.Va. lax game: ™

The rivalry.

You ‘can have your NFC East
Cowboys and Redskins, your old-
time Brooklyn Dodgers-New York
Yankees bloodlettings, and even that
hoops affair down south a ways be-
tween North Carolina and N.C. State.
They all dim in comparison — as far
as anyone in the shadow of the Colon-
nade is concerned — with what is to
take place Saturday afternoon on
Wilson Field. Here, ‘‘rivalry’’ means
Washington and Lee vs. Virginia in
lacrosse.

“It’s still for bragging rights of the
state. It is the biggest state rivalry,”’
U.Va. head coach Jim Adams said.

“It’s the two best lacrosse pro-
grams in the state,’’ said W&L head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘There’s a lot of
tradition. It’s more from our stand-
point to get up for U.Va. than for
them to get up for us.”

~The Generals dropped a tough
11-5 decision to Maryland last Satur-

Generals and the Cavaliers have met
42 times in the last 37 years, and
U.Va. leads the series 33-9. The last
time a W&L squad beat a Wahoo
team was in 1977. The closest W&L
has come since then has been a 13-8
defeat in 1980, the last time the
Generals made it to the NCAA tour-
nament.

“Its a big rivalry, but they don’t
respect us in the same way we
respect them,’’ W&L senior at-
tackman Rod Santomassimo said.

Due to last year’s contest in
Charlottesville, the tide of respect
may be turning. W&L played even-up
with the Cavaliers — including a
scoreless third quarter — before los-
ing 13-6.

Last year is the first thing on U.Va.

“Thinking back to last year, they
played a good game. We’ll never take
them lightly,’’ Gillin said.

School heightens effort
to add minority students

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

Recruitment of black students this
year is more intense than usual par-
tially because of the ‘automatic
segregation” of blacks on campus,
admissions officials say.

Efforts to increase minority enroll-
ment include the use of alumni re-
sources and programs that identify
qualified black students.

“We have never had sufficient
numbers of black kids here for them
to really feel a part of the institu-
tion,’’ said Van H. Pate, associate
director of admissions.

Pate said the tendency to ‘‘seek out
your own”’ has led black students at
Washington and Lee to be ‘‘auto-
matically segregated.”

From Staff Reports

 

 

Junior J. Christopher Hunter died

of a broken neck early Sunday about”

half a mile north of Lexington after
the car in which he was riding ran off
the road, recrossed it and then hit a
tree, authorities said.

The driver of the car, sophomore
P. Edward Henson, was charged
Monday with reckless driving and
driving under the influence of
alcohol.

Hunter, 21, of Cave Spring, Ga.,
was a politics major and former
rugby player who was assistant
social chairman of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon.

Medical Examiner F.A. Feddeman
said Hunter died of ‘‘a fractured neck
from hitting the windshield.”

SAE President L. Gray Sanders
said Hunter and Henson were return-
ing from a fraternity gathering at
Windfall, a country house where
several Washington and Lee students
live.

State police trooper E.R. Ham-
ilton, the investigating officer, said
the white 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass
was traveling south on state Route
681 about 1:30 a.m. when it ran off the
left side of the road.

Hamilton said the driver then cut
back across the road, forcing the car
off the right shoulder into a tree. He
said Hunter died ‘‘almost immediate-
ly upon impact.”

‘‘We need to create a critical mass
of black students on campus,’’ he
said.

The Admissions Office asked Fi-
nancial Aid Director John H. De-
Courcy to act as organizer of the min-
ority recruiting éffort. ~~ "8

“In some ways I guess I was the
natural choice,” said DeCourcy, who
was financial aid director at Florida
Memorial, a primarily black school
in Miami. He was also director of a
program designed to place highly
qualified and motivated minority stu-
dents in 30 public schools, such as
those in Swarthmore, Pa., and New
Canaan, Conn.

DeCourcy said that Admissions Di-
rector William M. Hartog III’s initial
request was for the establishment of

The trooper said the car was
traveling ‘‘probably around 50 mph.”’
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M. Rey-
nolds said the two-lane, paved road
has a posted speed limit of 25 mph.

If Hunter had been wearing a
seatbelt at the time of the crash,
Hamilton said, ‘‘it could have made
all the difference in the world.”’

Hamilton said Henson underwent a
blood test about 2% hours after the
wreck. He said the results will not be
received from the laboratory for.
about two weeks. The findings will
not be made public prior to the court
hearing.

Henson was charged based on a
warrant obtained from a magistrate,
according to Hamilton. The trooper
said Henson had begun to recover
from his injuries when he was charg-
ed at the Lexington police station
Monday afternoon. He was released
on his agreement to appear in court
— no bail was required.

Hamilton said the additional
charge of involuntary manslaughter
can be filed against Henson at the
discretion of the Commonwealth’s
Attorney. He said two factors in such
a charge would be if ‘‘an extremely
high rate of speed” was involved and
if the driver was “extremely intox-
icated.”’

‘There were no witnesses that I’m
aware of,’’ Hamilton said.

A preliminary hearing for the case
has been set for May 1 in Rockbridge
County General District Court.

The two charges that have been fil-
ed against Henson each carry a
potential penalty of up to a year in
jail, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. A
manslaughter charge would carry a
possible penalty of between one and

10 years in jail, a fine of up to $1,000,
or both.

Henson, a 20-year-old pre-med stu-
dent, attended the services for
Hunter that were held Tuesday in
Georgia. Sanders said Henson will be
at home in Dalton, Ga., for at least
the rest of the term.

Sanders said Henson suffered a
variety of head injuries. He said that
Henson had stitches taken on the in
side and outside of his mouth and that

Next year’s Executive Committee Big Three— (1tor) Michael Webb, John Lewis, Andrew Caruthers.

Lewis, Caruthers and Webb:
New ‘Big Three’ looks ahead

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

Professionalism and a_ serious attitude will
characterize next year’s Executive Committee, accord-
ing to the committee’s president- and vice president-
elect.

The EC also will do all it can to help the coeducation
transitiongo smoothly but will not overcompensate for
the change, President-elect John Lewis and Vice Presi-
dent-elect Andrew Caruthers said this week.

Although Lewis, Caruthers and Secretary-elect Mich-
ael Webb have not met to discuss next year’s plans, all
three offered their individual thoughts on the direction
they'would like to see the committee take.

“Our utmost concern is to be professional, and to have
a sense of professionalism when we deal with anything
in honor,”’ Caruthers said. This is something he said was
prevalent in the two Executive Committees he has serv-
ed on and will be an integral part of next year’s commit-
tee.

Caruthers is the only one of next year’s Big Three with
EC experience, but he said that the new members
will have no trouble learning the ropes. EC experience is
not necessarily a prerequisite for serving on the Big
Three, said Caruthers, adding that members will gain a
lot of experience on the job very quickly and this will
help them to do a good job.

Lewis, who, like Caruthers and Webb, can sit in on the
rest of this year’s EC meetings and executive sessions,

The death of Chris Hunter last weekend thrust sudden,
excruciating stress onto many members of the Universi-
ty community — administrators, his fraternity brothers,
his friends.

One of the largest single burdens was borne by senior
Gray Sanders, a close friend of Hunter’s and president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

An SAE junior praised Sanders’ conduct through the
crisis. ‘‘Although obviously distressed, he has led effec-
tively and with great compassion,’ the member said.

“It’s been the worst three days I’ve ever had,”
Sanders said Tuesday night as he relaxed in his room at
the SAE house. ‘‘We’ll get over it someday, but it’s a hor-
rible experience. It really does change the way you look
at the world.”’

He called a meeting for 4:30 a.m. Sunday to tell the
fraternity about the death. ‘‘We didn’t want people to
hear about it on the radio or from rumors,” he said. ‘‘It
was the worst meeting in my life — it was horrible.’’

“Some of the guys started crying right away,’’ he
recalled. ‘Others were just stunned.”’

Sanders said that at the Monday night house meeting,
each member said a few words during the usual ‘‘com-
ments” time. ‘‘There were 64 pretty big guys in there
just bawling, crying,”’ he said

“Chris was real loud and crazy,’ he said. ‘‘It was hard
to go to W&L and not know him, so if you were in his
fraternity, you really knew him well,”’ he said

Chris Hunter was killed Sunday morning when this car ran off the road.

‘It could have been

said he feels he will be able to learn much of what his job
entails by doing just that. Asked about his lack of ex-
perience, Lewis said that he thinks ‘‘a little new blood
once in a while is a good thing.”’

Lewis said that recent perceptions of problems on this
year’s EC stemmed from comparisons made between
this year’s EC and last year’s.

Last year’s EC was ‘‘very much in focus and very ob-
vious — couldn’t get away from it,’’ Lewis said. This
year’s committee, on the other hand, is a ‘‘reaction” to
last year’s and, as such, has taken a low profile. In that
sense, the EC was successful, Lewis said.

Of this year’s EC’s accomplishments, Lewis was un-
sure, ‘‘It seemed from the outside that little has been
done,” he said, because the inner workings of the EC
generally are not seen and the current president chose to
keep a low profile.

Caruthers, sophomore representative on this year’s
EC, said some of the problems this year stemmed from
the way the EC was run. “This year’s president has
missed more meetings this year as president than I per-
sonally ever have,”’ he added.

Lewis said he plans to run next year’s EC “‘halfway be-
tween those two [Executive Committees].’’ He will not
bring up ‘‘outrageous”’ issues before the EC, he said, but
rather will find out what is important to students.

“I’m going to find out what’s important to W&L before
I speak, before the committee speaks,’’ he explained.

To aid in the transition between ECs, a visit to Sky-
lark, the University’s mountain retreat, has been plan-

anyone’

According to Sanders, the fraternity’s grief is focused
both on the heart-rending death of a friend and on the ap-
parent randomness of the tragedy.

“There’s the personal loss part of it — that really does
hurt,’’ he said. ‘‘The other aspect of it is that it was a fill-
in-the-blank situation —‘it could have been anyone in the
school.’’

‘All it would have taken was having a stinkin’ seatbelt
on,”’ he said. ‘Now you can’t get ina car with a member
of this fraternity without them buckling up.”’

Sanders said the anguish felt by the house intensified
as the week began. “It’s gotten worse,” he said. ‘‘When
it first hit, everyone in the house was, like, numb. It took
a while to grasp it.”

‘Meals are real quiet,’’ he continued. ‘‘People are
spending a lot of time by themselves, trying to under-
stand it. I can’t understand it myself.”’

Sanders wondered aloud if ‘‘there is anything positive
that can come out of this.”’

“T think there is,” he said. ‘‘It’s a horrible way to learn
what a car cando.”’

“You read about these things — it wasn’t supposed to
happen here or happen to anyone here,”’ he said. “‘It’s
not like a slap in the face — it’s like a kick in the
stomach. It makes you hurt inside.”’

“No one’s every going to forget it — it’s too horrible,”’
he said. ‘‘This is the closest most people in the house
have ever come to death. We’re young guys and most of
us haven't had much contact with death.”’

“Lifestyles — I don’t know if they’ll change or not,’’ he
said. ‘‘That’s what so sad about it — I don’t know if it'll
change anything.”

Sobering thoughts

Chris Hunter died this past weekend in a gruesome car ac-
cident. Some people are human and mourn; others will make
passing promises never to drink and drive; some will vow

never again to drink period.

But I am a skeptic about matters promissory. Hunter’s
death was simply unnecessary, and many people indirectly
stand to blame for it. I am not trying to diminish his death or
begin the fingerpointing by going on a witch-hunt; rather, his
death serves as a tragic reminder of how a good thing has
been corrupted along the way. Many parties — no pun intend-
ed — have aided in this perversion and each stands equally

“guilty.”

The Fraternity Rules Committee last May issued a report
to the Board of Trustees recommending the curbing of the
fraternity party schedules. Mid-week parties were regulated,
and weekend parties were limited to four per house per term.
Although their primary motive was “‘limiting wear and tear
on the house,”’ the group also believed limiting the party
schedules would help to re-orient students to matters acade-
mic. However, those recommendations have proven to have
several flaws, and this weekend’s death was proof of one of

those failures.

In their near religious zeal to curb the party schedules, the
group failed to realize that fraternity members, like the aver-
age American taxpayer, will try to find a loophole in regula-
tions. The faculty and student group deriving the rules play-
ed exactly into the hands of the fraternities by providing sev-
eral loopholes. The party Hunter was attending was held far
from campus because the fraternity involved did not want
the party to count as one of its official four parties. Unfor-
tunately, while that is totally ‘‘legal,’’ it also proves to be

very lethal.

Students who venture to distant country ranches over wind-
ing country roads, drink their fill and then try to make the
return drive tempt fate. They ought to realize that drinking
and driving don’t mix. But the Rules Committee, by disallow-
ing parties in the fraternity houses where the vast majority
of the ‘‘partiers’”’ might live, has indirectly ‘‘pushed’’ the par-
ties out of town and away from the majority of students’
dwellings. Their rules serve as a silent partner in this most

heinous of crimes.

But the hand has many fingers pointing blame, and stu-
dents certainly deserve some. Just a month ago, students
across the campus and the state decried the state govern-
ment’s move to raise the drinking age to 21 for all alcoholic
beverages. ‘‘We are old enough to fight’”’ and ‘“‘we are old
enough to vote’’ are but a few of the paper defense slogans
students shouted. The sayings are all trite, and the reasoning
quite shallow. We may think we are mature enough to handle
drinking and driving just as we are mature enough vote and
be drafted but Hunter’s death says everyone at that party
certainly wasn’t mature enough to handle drinking and driv-
ing. But, you may say, that was only a few students, and cer-
tainly not ‘‘me.” We must all accept equal blame if we are all
collectively going tc enjoy the benefits of an 18-year-old

drinking age.

We students need to sober up. We need to realize that all
those cute advertising jingles about drinking and driving
have a very profound bottom line — death. We students need
to realize that having fun and taking risks are not always the
same. We students need to start acting more our ages and
begin to display the maturity we claim we have and with
which we desire to be entrusted. Life is far more than a quick
buzz on the weekend or pretty women on Wednesday nights.

Working together, as concerned faculty, students and
friends, changes can — indeed, must — be made so that
future tragedies are prevented.

There’s nothing quite like death to
remind us that life goes on beyond
the Colonnade.

When students and a recent grad-
uate die on mountaintop, on roadside
and apartment floor, we hear morta-
lity whistle through our conscious-
ness like the clammy gusts of recent
sunny days.

Ask that kind of wind, and it will
say the warmth it closes ‘round is but
one spark between eternal nights.
But striding past our pillars of wis-
dom, it is only each of us who knows
if the soul has chilled before the toes.

Who can say how many living dead
are entombed in the heads we pass
each day? Who can say how many
have surrendered to something less
than inner fire?

We wonder when we nod greeting
only to blank stares plodding our
periphery. We wonder when the ideal
shatters in the scrutiny of the Law.
We wonder when we hear of men who
cannot face the day without a drink.
We wonder when we lose what once
was wonderment, and awe and inter-
est.

Where is that tiny mind that wants
to capture every thing and moment
of each day...touch it, hold it, let it
go? You can see it at the church steps
almost any day, turning and turning
in widening walks — children reach-
ing out with tiny arms and eyes so
wide they swallow you whole.

We all began that way.

We all began with a reverence for
living — a belief that we could fly.
Then we found that leaves fall for
those who cannot fly. And then we

MY VIEW

 

By B. Scott
Tilley

With all due respect and admira-
tion for Mr. McAlevy... “It’s that
time again.’’ Time when high school
seniors wrack their brains trying to
decide before that looming April 1
deadline which institution of higher
learning they are going to lend their
incredible knowledge, personalities
and leadership to for the next four
years.

All of the ratios will be checked
out: student-teacher ratios, library
volumes per student, male-female
ratios and the number of parties per
week,

Parents and friends, teachers and
alumni will all chip in their two cents’
worth. And of course, the ever-pre-
sent “College Guides’ will be
consulted.

From Yale’s outstanding ‘‘Insid-
er’s Guide to the Colleges’ to The
New York Times’ fine ‘Selective
Guide to the Colleges”’ to Lisa Birn-
bach’s attempt (poor imitation?) ata
college guide, outsiders try to show
what it is like to be an insider at the
colleges.

And it is amazing the different
number of images a prospective
mink can draw of W&L by consulting
a variety of given guides, from
Yale’s ‘‘...image of a traditional
southern gentleman” to Lisa’s ‘‘rich,
preppy asshole’’ view.

It doesn’t stop there. Though some-
times in synch in some aspects of
W&L, these guides seem to have been
visiting different schools in reaching
their conclusions.

A small sampling of what these
prospective students are being led to
expect at W&L:

Academics:

Yale: “W&L’s academics are
solid. Traditional strengths have
been the humanities, particularly
history,”’

NY Times: Four stars (out of five).
“Excellent preprofessional pro-
grams...outstanding departments in
English and history... The excellent

learned that leaves are green before
they dry to brown and crinkle like
moth’s wings.

We learned that light makes green
leaves live and calls all the moths
together out back by the garbage
cans. We learned how moths and but-
terflies begin in little sleeping bags
from which they flourish.

We learned that we too began in lit-
tle sleeping bags, but burst out to
others teaching us how to fly. We
learned to love our parents.

Finally we came to this place
where we are our parents. Here we
learn how to learn or to pretend to
learn. We learn that learning is not
like turning leaves or butterflies. We
learn that learning is the creation of
letters and numbers that signify how
well we learned.

And we are taught to wrap our fluid
lives in paper packets to be placed in
certain hands at the fitting time. We
are taught to take the Fifth, to toe the
line to keep a train of thought on its
tersest track.

We read about life in Bolivia, about
economies of scale and the music of
the spheres. We meet FIFO, LIFO
and SWAPO. We discuss the meaning
of something someone wrote about
caves and shadows ‘round a fire cen-
turies ago.

We talk into natural light and con-
sider the consequences. Someone is
dead. Someone is in jail.

These things, we realize, have a
way of erasing a GPA. Death of body
or soul, we find, has a way of finding
the least common denominator
— how we have treated each other
and what we've left behind in words.

When a man becomes entombed
— by soil, steel bars or stagnation of
his soul — this thing called learning
disappears. All that’s left is the me-
mory of a good word spoken between
sweaty August sprints.

Lisa: ‘‘A guy can get a good educa-
tion at W&L.”’

Academic Pressure:

NY Times: ‘‘Anyone aiming for
more than a gentleman’s C, though,
will find the workload stiff. ‘Guts are
simply not to be found,’ one former
student said.”’

Lisa: ‘‘HA, HA, HA.”’

Tradition:

Yale: ‘Although many campuses
boast a reverence for tradition and
an equal number possess a flavor of
social and political awareness there
are few that combine the two as ef-
fectively as W&L.”’

NY Times: ‘Although certain tra-
ditional aspects of the school, like the
stately brick and white-columned
buildings, still preserve the atmos-
phere of the Old South, the only real
throwback to the days of Lee is the
all-male student body.”’ (Time for a
new edition).

Lisa: ‘‘Favorite school tradition:
Going down the road — a bunch of
guys get drunk, pile into a car, and
set out to abuse girls at a chosen
girls’ school.”

General Lee:

Yale: ‘General Robert E. Lee,
president of the college for five years
after the Civil War, is spoken of as a
‘living presence’ on campus.”’

Lisa: “‘ ‘General Lee has a real in-
fluence on why people come here.
He’s a god. ‘We call him St. Bob.
Thirty-five percent of the students’
rooms have a picture of General Lee
on proud display.”

Honor System:

Yale: ‘‘An effective honor system,
run entirely by the student govern-
ment...encourages the easygoing re-
ciprocal respect common among the
students.”

NY Times: “This level of respect
and friendliness is a result not only of

how this one fell to earth with naught

we were when mortality stung his

But the ancient said those lines run

said we should find these before we

method to this identification than the
survey of others’ talents for how
could we define personal excellence
without the benchmarks of our
peers? To do so would be to catch the
blueness of the mountains in a brush
and spread it on our face like blush.

So when we talk of excellence; let
us not speak in absolutes. Let us
remember how little we have learned
and how few we have known.

Let us remember that learning is
not only learning terms, but coming
to terms with leaves and moths and
children turning into men. Let us

creates a high-pressure social scene.
It isn’t a good idea to appear too
studious, and for these unsure of
themselves socially, W&L is proba-
bly a bad choice.”

NY Times: ‘‘The school’s 17 frater-
nities are still the movers and
shakers of the W&L social scene,
each hosting parties almost every
weekend. About two-thirds of the
students go Greek and those who
don’t are urged to share the social
life by ‘at least hanging out at one,’ ”

Lisa: ‘‘Almost 65 percent of W&L’s
1,363 undergraduates is Greek, divid-
ed into seventeen fraternities. Con-
duct has been a problem. And ‘mini-
mum standards’ may be adopted.”’
Women/Coeducation:

Yale: ‘Women on campus will un-
doubtedly have a major impact on
life at Washington and Lee, but no
one is sure yet exactly what it will be.
W&L is used to being a very male uni-
versity, and that aspect of the school
is unlikely to change right
away...Despite the admission of wo-
men, W&L will probably always be
defined by conservative male tradi-
tions.”’

NY Times: “‘Despite the number of
eager and eligible young women de-
scending on Lexington each week-
end, students continually cite the all-
mate environment as the school’s
biggest drawback. Maybe the time
has come for Washington and Lee to
surrender again.”

Lisa: ‘Washington and Lee has
just made the epic decision to admit
women for the first time, which real-
ly burns a lot of students who like it
just the way it is...Most of the guys at
W&L see girls solely as diversions,
They have no concept of women as
thinking beings.”’

Conservatism:

Yale: “W&L students, despite an
outwardly conservative manner, are
hard-working — and hard-playing
— males who combine a liberal edu-
cation with a very active social life.
This liberal-conservative balance is
the real strong point of the school.”

NY Times: ‘Conservatism is as
much a part of the 20th century as of
the nineteenth and the student body
at Washington and Lee is no excep-
tion. One student writes bluntly that

‘ ‘people who do not like Southern

preppies and fairly rich, elitist peo-
ple’ should not come to W&L,”’

Lisa: ‘‘Students are conservative

To the Editors:

Iam writing this letter on behalf of
the Executive Committee to express
its views on the recent considerations
to cut back the “‘niceties’’ (as Mr.
Epley termed them) — the 24-hoyy

Colonnade classrooms, the gymna.
sium hours as they stand and the an.
nual Catalogue. The Committee y.
nanimously opposes any tampering
with these traditions; the mere fact
that these are even ‘‘considerations” —
is appalling. The 24-hour library
schedule is one of the most impres.
sive aspects of W&L and should
never be abolished; the Colonnade
classrooms’ availability adds to this
dimension as well; the gymnasium
hours are too short as it is; and print. |
ing the Catalogue annually is not a
“nicety” but rather just good sense.

If $30,000 is so badly needed that we
would even make these radical pro.
posals our ‘‘considerations,”’ the Uni-
versity is indeed in poor financia|
shape. Why not consider letting in
four more freshmen in order for their
tuition ($28,400) to defray or subsi- |
dize these ‘‘niceties” as they were —
wrongly termed?

Accordingly, it is time to set the |
record straight: the 24-hour library,
the 24-hour accessibility to Colon-
nade classrooms, the gymnasium
hours as they stand, and the annual
Catalogue are not “‘niceties’’ at all.
They are NECESSITIES to W&L’s
atmosphere. They are the things that
set up apart from every other small
university. Take away these and you
have taken away W&L’s advantage
to stand head-and-shoulders above
the rest.

The Executive Committee strongly
opposes the mere consideration of
these necessities as ‘‘budget-cuts.”
These traditions make up the founda-
tions of the Washington and Lee ex- |
perience: foundations are not for
“consideration.”’

Yale: “‘W&L’s campus is beautful.
Its centerpiece is ‘the Colonnade,’ a
long row of adjacent halls with — you

Facing the Colonnade is the Lee

“But conservatism doesn’t mean —
apathy. The traditional mock politi- ©
cal convention held every four years
for the party out of power is the best
example of the school’s savoit-

“Washington and Lee has, in many —
ways, integrated the best of two —
worlds. Like the state of Virginia
itself, the school has one foot in the
North, one in the South, one in the
past, and one in the future.”

NY Times: ‘Despite stiff grading
the rapport between students and —
teachers is excellent.”

“Never prone to false modesty, the
W&L man considers himself ‘better-
looking, more intelligent, more out-
going, and more self-confident than
the average male.’ ”’

“Students spend their first year liv-

and eating well in Evans Dining Hall.

Motives questioned

To the Editors:

This week we held a final election
to decide who will represent us as of-
ficers of the Executive Committee.
Now that we have elected the Big
Three, I would like all of us to con-
sider who we have voted for and what
their actual motives for running for
office might have been.

Among any list of candidates run-
ning for an office, there are those
who run for persona! or utilitarian
reasons and those who run for the
benefit of the institution whose office
they would like to hold. In light of
this, I would like to bring up the fol-
lowing statement made by Andrew
Caruthers: ‘‘It’s a thankless job, but
it’s a good resume filler.’’ Now this
statement was made by Mr. Caru-
thers not in reference to his own posi-
tion as sophomore EC representa-
tive, but I feel justified in making the
inference from this statement about
a particular office, to any office in
general.

Now what strikes me funny about
this statement is that Mr. Caruthers

acts as if an office owes the office-
holder something — if not thanks,
then at least a greater security of ob-
taining economic employment. But,
Mr. Caruthers, the job is not there for
the benefit of you, it’s there for the
benefit of the institution. I am not
singling out Mr. Caruthers, but would
like all of us to consider the underly-
ing motives of those running for pub-
lic offices and remind those who hold
them who serves what and what
serves whom.

If the sum total of the individual
ballots decides the election and if the
majority of the individual ballots
have not been based upon rational
grounds, then the elected candidates
have been chosen either non-rational-
ly or irrationally. Our own ballot is
relatively insignificant when com-
pared to the rest, but it is very cru-
cial that we make it, and make it ra-
tionally.

If more of us actually considered
who we were voting for, and for what
reasons, I think a lot of us would end
up voting for persons other than

those we originally intended to. Even
if we end up voting for the same can-
didate, at least we have made a wiser
choice.

There lies a parallel here to our-
selves as students. If we strictly con-
sider our education here as a means
to an end and our GPA proportional
to how much money we'll make later
in life, then I believe we’re here for
the wrong purpose. Everywhere you
hear of student apathy and profes-
sors’ contempt for students and
wonder why.

It seems too many of us value our
grades over what we as students
have learned. Just because we have
received a poor grade in class doesn’t
mean that we haven't learned any-
thing. I have often learned more
from classes I received a poor grade
in than one I have received a good
grade in. If coeducation brings in an
avant-garde of new students with dif-
ferent values toward education, then
I’m all for it.

S. African foes hypocritical

To the Editors:

I was highly amused by reading
last week’s Phi article about law Pro-
fessor William Geimer’s proposed
protest against South Africa, whose
government is characterized by an
apartheid policy of white supremacy.
Mr. Geimer and those helping him
are typical of liberals everywhere
— misguided and hypocritical. Like
the Kennedy kids and others who
have made it a fad to be arrested-in-
protest, Geimer is directing his at-
tention to the least of the evils.
Wouldn’t it be great if we saw Gei-
mer protesting the oppressive Sandi-
nista regime, or genocidal war in
Afghanistan or the persecution of the
Church in Poland? Or better yet, why
don’t we see Geimer protesting US.
commercial relations with the Soviet
Union, whose tyranny over its people
is as well knownas it is deplorable?

Instead, these ‘‘protesters’’ at
W&L and those on a greater scale
decry a government which has re-
cently drawn up a new constitution
and repealed a number of repressive
regulations aimed at blacks. It’s a
government which spends millions of
dollars annually to make blacks
more self-sufficient and better edu-
cated. Even ‘‘60 Minutes’’ told of
over a million black illegal immi-
grants who were drawn from their
own black-led oppressive dictator-
ships to South Africa’s better wages,

Ex-colum

To the Editors:

I would like to correct a misstate-
ment of fact by the Ring-tum Phi’s
chief editors in last week’s “‘Readers’
Advocate’ column.

Last summer I agreed to write the
“Readers’ Advocate’ column this
school year. The column never got off
the ground because of a disagree-
ment between the Phi’s chief editors
and myself over how much control
they would have over its content.
Chief Editors Mike Allen and Bruce
Potter wanted to delete some rather
innocuous — but relevant — informa-
tion from my first column last fall.

Last week Peter Wright, the new
‘Readers’ Advocate,”’ reported that
the editors claim ‘‘they merely
wanted to discuss and question some
of the information and had no inten-
tion of deleting it’’ without my appro-
val.

This was not the case. I have the
original copy of my column in which
the information is clearly marked out
by an editor’s red pen. Errors of style
and spelling had been corrected and
column and type sizes were indicated
at the top. It appears everything was
ready for it to be set in type.

If the editors just wanted to discuss
possible changes, why had they al-
ready edited the column and taken
out the information? In fact, what
transpired after they told me of the
changes was not a discussion: It was
a heated argument. I held to my con-
tention that if I was to objectively
and honestly evaluate the Phi’s co-
verage — the purpose of the ‘‘Advo-
cate’ column in the first place — I
could not allow them to delete infor-
mation I thought important. Both
Potter and Allen seemed surprised at
my objection. Allen told me that if
the editors could edit the column for
style, grammar and spelling, then
they could certainly take out infor-
mation they thought gave the wrong
impression.

Neither of the facts they wanted to
delete gave the wrong impression. In
my column, which dealt with Allen’s
coverage of the murder-and-arson in-
dictment of Scot Mesner, I noted that
Allen had ‘‘scooped’’ his competition,
including the Roanoke Times &
World-News, in getting an exclusive
interview with Mesner before he was
picked up by police. (The charges
have since been thrown out.) I
thought this information helped ex-
plain why Allen rushed to call Mes-
ner in Roanoke after the indictment
was announced in Lexington. But the
editors told me they didn’t want to
give readers the impression that they
were in competition with the

living and working conditions and ed-
ucational opportunities.

These positives are the very condi-
tions Geimer and friends want to
abolish by their demands. Many pro-
testers on the national level agree,
calling for total workplace desegre-
gation, training and promotions for
blacks and improved outside-the-
workplace conditions for blacks em-
ployed by U.S. corporations. The
more radical minds call for a total
disinvestment by U.S. firms. Bishop
Desmond Tutu, currently the liberal
patron saint, loves these ideas; how-
ever, one must beware of Tutu, who
backs the African National Congress,
which supports violence for ending
apartheid. For such views, Tutu
recently won the Nobel Peace Prize.

Geimer, et al, should listen to
others, such as Chief Gatsha Buthlezi
of the 6 million member Zulu tribe in
South Africa and head of the largest
political party there. ‘“‘Black people
of South Africa have not said they
want disinvestment,” Buthelezi said,
adding that ‘75 percent reject it.”
These comments are from a black
leader in South Africa, not a profes-
sor in Virginia.

What is. strikingly dangerous
(read: liberal) about Geimer’s views
is that;he wants not only the United
States government to sanction South
Africa, but he wants private corpor-
ations to do the same. Our govern-

nist gives

Roanoke paper. Just two days be-
fore, however, Allen had told me that
I would ‘‘never set foot’’ in the Phi’s
office if I ever took information from
‘Readers’ Advocate”’ interviews and
gave it to the Roanoke Times, which I
work for as a correspondent during
the school year. This does not sound
like the words of an editor who does
not consider himself in competition
with another paper.

In my column I also noted that
Allen had requested the column after
hearing criticism from a local police
official. Allen said he didn’t want to
give the impression that the ‘‘Read-
ers’ Advocate” columist was too
close to the Phi’s editors. This is
ridiculous. I was only noting to read-
ers where the idea for my column
had come from. I was not reporting
that I had been ordered to write it.

By trying to delete this informa-
tion, the editors were attempting to
do exactly what they wanted to not
give the impression they were doing
— tampering with the content of my
column. Their hostility to my objec-
tions only strengthened my fears
that, if there came a time when I
really criticized the Phi’s coverage,
my opinions might be watered down
by editing or never get into the paper.
After all, my first column had gener-
ally praised the Phi’s coverage and
the editors still wanted to make
changes.

There was one sidelight to our dis-
agreement. The editors also express-
ed concern that my work for the Roa-
noke Times might hinder my loyalty
to The Phi. I replied that I did not feel
my loyalty to The Phi was important,
since I understood my duties to be
those of an outside critic and not
those of an apologist for the Phi’s ac-
tions. I suggested that, to avoid my
discovering unpublished information
from The Phi, I would conduct all
interviews outside of the Phi’s office
and that the editors should not feel
obligated to answer if I inadvertently
asked questions that might uncover
sensitive facts. I also noted to the
editors that Allen was a correspon-
dent for the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch. In fact, the information from
the Mesner interview, billed as ‘‘an
exclusive’ in The Phi, had actually
appeared the day before in a story by.
Allen for the Times-Dispatch.
(Wright, as news director for the
campus radio and television stations,
also occasionally competes with The
Phi on news stories. )

The discussion ended after both
sides agreed that my column would
not run and that I would not continue

ment has no right to dictate to a com-
pany where or on what conditions it
can or cannot do business, except in
cases of extreme national security
reasons. Mr. Geimer would find it
impossible to prove such a case exist-
ed in South Africa. If the U.S. govern-
ment doesn’t want to have relations
with that country, fine. If Mr. Geimer
doesn’t want to buy the products of
companies with investments in South
Africa, that is fine too. But Geimer’s
views become alarming when he
calls for sanctions and disinvestment
by private corporations.

Those corporations Geimer is so
upset with have given more than $78
million for medical, housing and edu-
cational expenses to South African
black employees and their families
between 1978 and 1983. This was $78
million more than they had to pro-
vide, since a company is required to
do nothing for its employees not
related to work. Yet these corpora-
tions used their own money to help
black employees. Geimer, on the
other hand, is of the opinion that
sanctions and disinvestment would
help the South African black. A man
of Geimer’s education and research
experience should put two and two
together and get four. In his effort to
help the South African, he is foolishly
doing the opposite.

his vie

as the ‘Readers’ Advocate.” Only
after I was handed back my column
did Allen weakly offer that the edi-
tors had only wanted to discuss the
changes.

Perhaps our disagreement stem-
med from the past history of the col-
umn, Scott Mason, last year’s ‘‘Read-
ers’ Advocate,”’ told me of one occa-
sion on which a past editor ordered
him not to do a column airing criti-
cism of The Phi. I can see how the
present chief editors, who were on
the paper’s staff at the time, might
have gotten the wrong impression
about the role of the ‘Readers’ Ad-
vocate.”

I hope that the ‘“‘Readers’ Advo-
cate’’ is back on track now and that
Peter Wright will have the ‘‘complete
editorial control’ that the editors
promised on last week’s front page. I
was not given such control. Perhaps
the editors have realized that, as the
source and messenger of criticism
about the University, they have the
responsibility to open themselves up
to the same scrutiny. Such freedom
of expression can only make Wash-
ington and Lee a better place.

It is a shame, however, that this
realization came only after the con-
troversy that surrounded their hand-
ling of Steve Pockrass’ letter March
7. The aftermath included stern criti-
cism from journalism Professor
Clark Mollenhoff, whose recommen-
dations wield much influence when
W&L students seek reporting jobs
after graduation. If the Phi’s editors
respond to my letter, I hope that they
will give me the courtesy — one
denied Pockrass — of allowing me
my say first, I also hope
they will avoid questioning my
character and commpetence and in-
stead deal with the substantive issues
I’ve raised — once again, a courtesy
denied Pockrass.

‘Rag-tag’

Tight budget doesn’t check Hockey Club

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Ice
Hockey Club faces some inherent
problems in its quest to have fun and
stay competitive, according to the
club’s president, senior Burt Palmer

The basic assumption of ice hockey
is, of course, that one plays the game
on ice. Finding this ice, however, re
mains the biggest hindrance to the
club, because the only available rink
equipped to handle hockey is the Lan
cerlot Arena in Vinton

Because Vinton is the only ice
around, every hockey team in the
area needs to use it, and ice time is
scarce. The W&L club currently
practices only twice a month, accord
ing to Palmer, and usually must
share ice with another team

This lack of practice time, Palmer
said, makes it difficult for the play-
ers to stay in condition, and that lack
of conditioning affects the way the
team plays,

“We run four offensive units and

three defensive units so that each line
plays for only a couple of minutes,’
“It's really hard to keep
since we're not in

he said
fresh otherwise
top shape.”

Then there’s the problem of trans
portation. The University does not
allow club teams to use its fleet of
vans for games, so the club must ar
range other means. “‘It gets pretty
confusing,’ Palmer said

The team also faces a money short
age. The student Executive Commit
tee awarded the club $620 this year,
and each of the club’s 22 members
pay $25 in dues, for a total of about
$1,100. All of this money, Palmer
said, is spent on ice time and other
operating expenses. Each member
must supply his own equipment

The club borrows old football jer
seys from the athletic department for
its games, “It’s a rag-tag outfit,”’
senior Steve Carey said.

Palmer did not complain about the
situation, though. ‘The EC has a
tight budget, and they have been in-
creasing our funding each year for
the nact four vears IT just hope they

keep it up.”’

\ lot of that personally furnished
equipment serves double duty on
W&L lacrosse fields, as the club in
cludes several current or former
W&L lacrosse players. Most of the
players are from the North, Palmer
said, where hockey is more common
in the high schools and prep schools

   

 

Despite these problems, the club
manages to stay competitive
“We've got a lot of talent,” Carey
said. ‘And we can mix it up with
anybody.”

“Steve Carey can mix it up with
anybody,’’ Palmer added

The club’s next encounter will be
March 22-23 ina tournament in North
Carolina that will include club teams
from Duke University and Fort
Bragg

Next year, the elub will be led by
current treasurer Vin LaManna, and
Palmer sees continued success. ‘‘As
long as we can get our 20 to 25 players
each year as we've been doing in the
past four years, things will continue
to get better,”’ he said.

a direct mailing campaign
—‘something we haven't been doing
in the past.”

Since the campaign began, be-
tween 6,000 and 8,000 minority stu
dents have been sent information
about W&L.

The effort has yielded 34 applica
tions from black high school seniors,
including 13 women, for admission
next fall. Seven of the 13 have been
accepted, one on the Early Decision
program. Of the 21 black men who
applied, 17 have been offered admis
sion.

Pate said the remaining applicants
could be accepted ata later date.

Names of minority students are ob-
tained from such programs as A Bet-
ter Chance Inc. (ABC), the National
Achievement Scholarship Program
and Leadership Education and De-
velopment

DeCourcy’s goal as the organizer
of W&L’s effort to recruit minorities
is to establish a mailing list of be-
tween 500 and 1,000 minority coun-
selors and placement officials. He
said the mailings help generate a
great deal of interest in W&L.

Also,. DeCourcy attended several
ABC functions in Connecticut during
the fall to generate interest. He said

that limited time, however, restricts
his role as an ‘‘ambassador.”’

Mike Webb, a black sophomore
who was elected secretary of the Ex-
ecutive Committee last week and
who is a member of the Student Re-
cruitment Committee, said he ap-
plauds the Admissions Office efforts.

Webb said it is especially difficult
to attract black students from the
North because many of them and
their parents view the South as a
place of racial discrimination.

“By and large, once they are down
here things are OK,” hesaid.

Webb said that everyone must
enter new situations with an open
mind — including black students. ‘‘If
they’re separated, it's mainly
something by choice,” he said.

Seven black men and three black
women are among students the Uni-
versity has invited to spend three
days attending classes, meeting pro
fessors and getting a taste of the
social life. Students arrive late on a
Thursday and leave on a Saturday
after an interview with admissions
officers. The University pays the
complete cost of their travel, from as
far away as California

Three other black students will be
on campus this week.

Webb said his job with Student Re-
cruitment is to be ‘‘Mr. Cruise Direc-
tor to, make sure these kids have a
goodtime.” ~ oS

“People have been very impressed

with the academic atmosphere,” De-
Courcy said.

“People who have put us down as
just another school have put us at the
top of the list of the schools they want
tocome to,” he added.

DeCourcy said another resource
for attracting minority students is
minority alumni. He said that if each
black alumni would direct two black
students to W&L, “‘it would be a big
help.”

Eugene C. Perry Jr., who grad-
uated from W&L in 1975 and from the
law school in 1978 and who is current-
ly a special agent for the FBI, is
organizing a group of black alumni
for recruiting purposes.

According to James D. Farrar, ad-
missions director from 1962 to 1978
and now coordinator of alumni ad-
missions programs, ‘‘we're in an ab-
solutely new ball game in terms of at-
tracting students.”

‘You have to look back and realize
that in the sixties there just wasn’t
the effort to attract minorities,” he
said.

In 1966, the first black student “in
modern times” enrolled at W&L,
Farrar said. ‘‘And 1970 was the year
we really broke the line,’’ he added,

Outbreaks prompt infirmary

to inoculate against measles L

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The University infirmary is plan-
ning to give measles vaccinations to
about 400 students next week in
response to recent outbreaks at six
colleges, according to University
physician Dr. Frederick A. Fed-
deman.

The American College Health
Association sent a letter to health
services at colleges across the coun-
try urging that students be in-
oculated before their spring breaks,
Feddeman said.

Three people have died at Prin-
cipia College in Elsah, Ill., from com-
plications arising from red measles,
or rubeola. The college, operated by
the Christian Science Church, whose
members favor religious healing
over medical treatment, quarantined
itself after 112 people came down
with the disease.

In addition, Boston University
reported 65 cases of measles, Ohio
State University reported 13, and the

Art, writing

Although some details still need to
be ironed out, a handful of enterpris-
ing students are attempting to start a
literary magazine made up of work
by students from Washington and
Lee, Hampden-Sydney and the wo-
men’s colleges.

Freshman Anthony Cornealius has
been vocal in organizing the project
and on Monday presented his ideas to
the Executive Committee.

“The goal is to unify the schools on
a literary and artistic level and de-
velop and appreciation for each
school on this level,” Cornealius said.

As of this week, Mary Baldwin Col-

Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, Boston College and North-
eastern University reported at least
one case each.

Most of the affected schools have
begun inoculation programs.

Feddeman said it is important to
have students inoculated before
spring break, because the chance of
the disease spreading will increase
when students converge on Florida
for their vacations.

“That’s the big thing that worries
me: You don’t know who you're go-
ing to be mingling with,’’ he said.

The nurses in the infirmary have
been going through students’ records
to determine which students don’t
need shots, either because they have
already had them or because they
have had the disease.

Seniors make up 250 of the students
on the infirmary’s list, Feddeman
said, because the infirmary has no
record of whether they have had
shots. The University didn’t require
measles records of its students until
after the Class of 1985 entered.

lege, Hollins College and Southern
Seminary Junior College have com-
mitted to participating in the pro-
ject.Cornealius said he still is work-
ing to ensure participation by Hamp-
den-Sydney College, Randolph-Ma-
con Woman’s College and Sweet
Briar College. A meeting for in-
terested students will be held today
or Monday, Cornealius said.

Cornealius has proposed a 40-page
magazine, but that length is tentative
for a number of reasons. First, it only
is feasible if enough schools partici-
pate, he said, and second, the cost
may limit the number of pages that
can be published.

The projected cost for the as-yet-
unnamed magazine is $3,500. This
money will be raised through a $400-

Feddeman said students will be
asked if they have had either the
disease or the shots before. If any
doubts remain, the shots probably
will be administered because there is
no danger in having them twice in a
lifetime.

“The vaccine’s not that dangerous
at all,’’ Feddeman said.

The infirmary expects to send let-
ters or call students who need the
shots, Feddeman said, although
students can’t be required to get the
shots.

Red measles is a viral disease that
causes a fever and a facial rash for
as long as 10 days. The disease itself
is not fatal, but secondary infections
such as bronchitis and tuberculosis
can be fatal.

“I’ve been here 30 years, and I
don’t recall ever seeing red measles
here,”’ Feddeman said.

One of the reasons the disease is
cropping up among college-age
students, he said, is that when the
vaccination was first developed in
1963, it was administered to children
less than 1 vear old, and the immuni-

ty disappeared. The vaccinations
were then given to children over 1
and the problem was solved, but
children remained who weren’t im-
mune.

Feddeman said he might be able to
get the Lexington Health Depart-
ment to help pay for the costs of the
inoculations.

“In a situation like this, I think we
can probably get them to supply the
vaccine,”’ he said.

$500 contribution from each school. If
enough money isn’t raised in this
manner, patrons may be contacted
for contributions and advertisements
might be sold, Cornealius said. He
told the EC Monday that he will be re-
questing a specific amount of money
next week.

Although time permits only one
issue this year, Cornealius said he
hopes to produce the magazine twice
a year in the future.

The publication will consist of
poetry, essays and short stories.
However, Cornealius said he is cer-
tain this magazine will be different
from the Ariel, a literary magazine
already funded by the EC, in a num-
ber of ways.

“Unlike the Ariel and other maga-

zines,’’ Cornealius said, ‘‘we plan to
use new techniques. For instance,
very few blend the artwork with the
poem and make them each a part.”’

In other words, Cornealius hopes to
design the magazine so that the writ-
ten word will be printed in direct con-
junction with the artwork, in some
cases with the poem or essay directly
on top of the artwork.

In addition, the writers will work
directly with the magazine’s artist in
creating an illustrated interpretation
of the poems.

“There are some arguments on the
look,’’ Cornealius said. ‘‘Some don’t
like the idea of the art, but I feel it
sets us apart. We are striving to
create the art and the poem
together.”’

$677,000 pavilion called ‘tremendous asset’

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

Now in its third month of full-time
use, the student activities pavilion,
even with its $677,000 price tag, is a
benefit to the University, according
to Associate Dean of Students Mich-
ael A. Cappeto.

Cappeto, the faculty adviser for
pavilion activities, called the enter-
tainment/athletic facility ‘‘a tremen-
dous asset.”

“‘T would like to see it used more,”
he said. ‘‘But it is already serving the
purpose for which we had intended
ig!

The costs of the pavilion, which
was built during the summer and
completed during the fall term,
break down as follows: $277,000 came
from the University, and the student
body paid $400,000 financed by a loan
from the University at 91% percent for
25 years.

The student body is paying back

  

Editors

the loan through a $25 addition to the
student tax, which is paid as part of
tuition. At the end of 25 years, stu-
dents will have paid more than $1
million for the pavilion.

According to University Treasurer
E. Stewart Epley, ‘If the $400,000
had been left with the professional
endowment investors, it would have
created, within 20 to 25 years, ap-
proximately $1.3 million in reve-
nues.”’

A final cost incurred by the pavi-
lion is the annual $15,000 operating
expense, which goes to gas, electrici-
ty, water and sewage, and is not sup-
plemented by any revenues from
pavilion activities.

On the benefits side, the additional
activities students can be involved in
with the pavilion are almost endless.

“In comparison to other schools in
our league, few if any colleges have
comparable facilities,’ Associate
Athletic Director Richard Miller
Said.

The pavilion is used for University-

wide social activities, intercollegiate
athletic practices and _ physical
education classes during inclement
weather, student organizations’ — in-
cluding fraternities — social events
and, according to Cappeto, ‘‘any rea-
sonable request by the students.”’

The athletic department uses the
pavilion Monday through Thursday,
according to the guidelines set for its
use. Miller said athletes are much
safer in the pavilion, with its softer
athletics-oriented Mondoflex floor,
than they are outside in the rain or in-
side Warner Center, with its hard-
wood floor.

“The facility meets the basic
need,’’ Miller said, ‘‘but it’s not ade-
quate in size.”

The athletics department had
wanted a facility that was big enough
to hold an indoor track. It is only big
enough to house a tennis court.

Any organization that wants to use
the pavilion must make reservations
with Cappeto and pay a $50 down pay-
ment toward the $75 total fee. Also,

and Managers

the group must either provide its own
cleanup or pay the University to doit.

The $75 cost goes to pay a student
manager who must be present.

Another benefit of the pavilion is a
less obvious one.

‘We want to make it as easy as
possible for students to stay on cam-
pus,’’ Cappeto said.

A party facility close to campus re-
duces wear on fraternity houses and
keep students from drinking and
driving, Cappeto said.

The University has $67,000 remain-
ing from the original cost of the pavi-
lion. Epley said that would be used to
complete the access road and park-
ing facilities.

Cappeto also said additions to the
pavilion are in the offing.

‘‘By next fall picnic tables and bar-
becue equipment will be installed
along the hillside next to the pavi-
lion,” he said. ‘‘These facilities will
be available to all students at all
times.”’

Coed switch

proved

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

 

Changing from an all-male college
to a coed college was ‘‘easier than
expected,’ according to the presi-
dent of Davidson College when it
made that transition in 1972.

Samuel R. Spencer Jr., president
of Davidson from 1968 to 1983, said
that the switch was easy in an institu-
tional sense. Davidson did not have to
change its academic program when
it went coed, although the universi-
ty’s facilities had to be changed to ac-
commodate women, he added.

Spencer, who is now president of
the Virginia Foundation for Indepen-
dent Colleges, spoke at last Thurs-
day’s Phi Beta Kappa/Society of the
Cincinnati Convocation and met with
the Coeducation Steering Committee.

The transition years at Davidson
were toughest on the first few classes
of women, Spencer said in an inter-
view, because the large imbalance in
the number of men and women on
campus made the social life at Da-
vidson difficult at first.

“The women were pioneers. The
first women were a bit conspicuous.
They naturally felt a bit self-con-
scious,’’ Spencer said. Everyone at
Davidson tried very hard to make the
women feel comfortable, however,

Spencer said. But there were no wo-
men’s groups on campus at the time
to provide additional support for the
first women,

Nevertheless, Spencer said that the
university avoided any really serious
problems during the transition.

One area where there were pro-
blems during the transition years
was in the athletic department, he
added.

“T don’t think we planned well
enough in sports,”’ Spencer remark-
ed. “In the sports area they [the
women] did feel that we were slow in
responding to their needs.”’

Spencer said Davidson tried to
meet women’s demands for sports as
they arose, and now has a sound
women’s athletics program in place.

A second area in which Davidson
encountered some unexpected pro-
blems was in that of health care,

Transition ‘‘easier than expected”’

Spencer reported. Although no major ”
additions were needed in Davidson’s .
health care services, some changes
were necessary to provide for wo- *
men’s health care needs when the
school went coed.

A lot of planning and several years
of preparing the students, faculty
and alumni for the possible switch to
coeducation were the keys to the ease
of the transition, Spencer said. The
Davidson administration tried to_
avoid making decisions by fiat or °
order, he added. /

One of the university’s first moves _
in testing the waters to see how coed-
ucation would go over at Davidson «
was to begin bringing in a small
number of women exchange students
during the late 60s. Spencer said. He
added that it was important to see
how women would be accepted at Da-
vidson before making the decision to |"”
go coed in 1972. ‘

Spencer cited an improved social
life and a more qualified student
body as two of the most important »
benefits of the switch to coeducation.

Davidson was a “‘suitcase college’
before it went coed, Spencer said.
Many of the students were off cam-,
pus on weekends at women’s colleges
when the school was all-male.

“This [coeducation] has made for
a campus that has a much more
healthier social life,’ Spencer said.

Academically, Spencer said that ,,
after going coed Davidson experienc-
ed improvements in the quality of its ©
admission candidates similar to.
those W&L has experienced this
year. Spencer said this was the natu-*’
ral result of both the availability of,
women students and the ability of the
school to attract men who did not
want to go toan all-male college.

"We Are The World’’ — the record
made by 46 American musical super-
stars to raise money for African
hunger relief — should be available
in Lexington no later than tomorrow.

Two local record stores, Flip Side
and the Campus Shop (formerly
Campus Corner), say they’ve had re-
quests for the singles and plan to
have them in stock by tomorrow.

The song, released nationally last
Thursday, was written by Michael
Jackson and Lionel Richie and is
available on both a 7-inch and a 12-
inch single. Half a million copies of
the 7-inch single and 150,000 copies of
the 12-inch single were released.

An album, featuring the single and
unreleased songs by Prince, Linda
Ronstadt and Bruce Springsteen, is
planned for release April 1.

Approximately 70 percent of the
proceeds from the effort will go to
charity, according to CBS, which is
releasing the records. Ninety percent
of that will go to African relief and
the rest will be used to aid the hungry
and homeless in America.

The single was recorded in Los
Angeles in January at a recording
session that included Springs’zen,

Richie, Jackson. Tina Turner, Bob
Dylan, Cyndi Lauper, Stevie Wonde'
and Willie Nelson. ‘

“We Are The World” is on the play:
list of WLUR-FM, according to sta-
tion manager Bob Bryant, but it i*
not being given specific priority over
other songs. ‘‘We more or less leave
it up to the disc jockeys,” Bryant
said.

He added that it is being played
quite a bit on the station’s Morning
Magazine show.

In a related effort, Maj. Stephen
RiCharde, assistant professor of psy-
chology at Virginia Military Insts
tute, organized a Christmas party to
raise money for African relief.

Guests at the party made donations
at the door, and the event raised
about $1,300. RiCharde said mone,
was donated to OXFAM America, a°
organization that works on a loca!
level in Africa to combat hunger.
About 75 percent of the money dé’
nated will be used for actual food that
will be sent to Africa, and the other 25
percent will be used for working wit
local farmers to help educate them in
more modern agricultural methods,
he said.

RiCharde said the party was 4
community effort involving local
merchants who donated snacks art!
mixers and the faculties of both VMI
and Washington and Lee. -

he had a possible cracked jaw and
several loose teeth but no broken
bones.

“He looked like he’d gotten beaten
up really badly,’’ Sanders said.

The crash occurred about one-
fourth of a mile from the Windfall
driveway, Sanders said, adding that
the tree the car hit is very close to the
roadway.

Some of the fraternity members
still at Windfall heard the crash, ac-
cording to Sanders. Three of them
discovered the wreck shortly there-
after on their way back to the frater-
nity house.

Five SAEs and one other student
live at Windfall, which Sanders said
has been “‘in the fraternity’’ for about
15 years.

He said the gathering had been
over for more than an hour when
Hunter and Henson left.

“Everybody who saw Ed did not
think he was drunk,’’ Sanders said.

 

: “We wouldn’t have let him drive if he
- was. No one thought he was drunk —I

don’t see how he could have been.”’
Sanders said there were 64 people

. and only one keg of beer at the
_ gathering. ‘‘There was no organized
. drinking,” he said.

The driving under the influence

é charge was filed, Hamilton said,

because ‘‘through my investigation, I
could determine that alcohol was in-

- volved.”

Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
who talked with Hunter’s parents and
who said he has been in ‘‘constant
contact’’ with the members of SAE,
said news of the death ‘‘hit everyone
very hard — especially his friends in
his fraternity.”

“The initial impact is always dif-
ficult,”’ he said. ‘‘The initial concern
is that a friend is dead.

“Then you get into questions of
why and how it happened and these
other concerns are raised.”’

A memorial service for Hunter in

Lee Chapel yesterday afternoon was
attended by about 300 administra-
tors, professors, W&L students and
students from area women’s col-
leges. Psalms were read by
Sanders and by SAE sophomore W.
Barritt Gilbert of Rome, Ga.

University Chaplain David W.
Sprunt prayed for the families of
both Hunter and Henson. He spoke of
“the dark confusion in our minds as
we ask the unanswered question of,
‘Why?’ ”’

At Monday’s Executive Committee
meeting, presiding officer Sam
Dalton asked for a moment of silence
for Hunter. ‘‘He was a good friend of
mine and I think we all knew him,”
Dalton said.

Phi Delta Theta on Monday sent a
letter of sympathy signed by all its
members. ‘‘That was an incredibly
nice gesture,’ Sanders said. ‘“‘We
really did appreciate it.”

Hunter’s family has said that dona-
tions may be made in his name to the
football program at Darlington Pre-
paratory School in Rome, Ga:

Contributions may be sent to the
Darlington fund in care of Gray San-
ders, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 205 E.
Washington St.

Sanders said the fraternity’s
Bahamas Party — ‘‘one of our big-
gest parties’”’ — had been scheduled
for tomorrow but has been cancelled.
At the party, there traditionally is a
drawing for a four-day trip for two to
the Bahamas.

He said the money that would have
been spent on the party is being
donated to the Darlington fund, and
each member of SAE is contributing
an additional $20.

SAE has a number of house renova-
tions planned for this summer. A
drawing by Hunter of the house and
its members will be placed per-
manently in one of the rooms, which
will be named for him.

The fraternity also is planning to
purchase a memorial page for
Hunter in The Calyx.

SAE’s pledge initiation, which had
been set for Saturday in Lee Chapel,
has been postponed until Wednesday.

Road deaths

Drinking, driving called additional hazard on rural roads

 

From Staff Reports

 

The incidents blot the memory of nearly every
student generation:

Feb. 22, 1970: Returning from a debate tourna-
ment, a Washington and Lee professor and a jun-
ior are killed at 5 a.m. when their car hits a guard
rail and spins out of control after the driver falls
asleep at the wheel.

*May 14, 1975: Three W&L students returning
from an away lacrosse game die in a single-car ac-
cident on Interstate 81.

*Sept. 25, 1982: Three Virginia Military Institute
cadets and one Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
student are killed after the driver loses con-
trol of the car on U.S. 11 about three miles out of
Lexington.

eMarch 17, 1985: Returning from a fraternity
gathering in the country, a W&L junior dies in-
stantly as the car in which he is riding twice runs
off the road, finally hurtling into a roadside tree.

These are just four of the incidents on a numbing
list of fatal automobile accidents involving
area students in recent years.

The haunting, inevitable questions: Who's
next? It could be you. When? It could be this
weekend.

Young people and automobiles often have been
said to be a lethal combination. When alcohol and
this area’s treacherous roads are added to the
mix, the potential for disaster is terrifying.

Junior John Lewis, for example, frequently
travels to local women’s colleges. ‘‘These are
crazy roads,” he said. “I find it amazing that
more people aren’t killed.”’

‘The road to Sweet Briar is probably the worst
road in the state,’ he continued. ‘‘Randolph-
Macon is the same way — I don’t see how anybody
can drive 501 with more than one beer.

“Hollins isn’t too bad — straight down 81; Mary
Baldwin is straight up 81. But these others are pro-
bably some of the most dangerous roads in the
country.”

Dean of Students Lewis G. John agreed, noting
that many area roads are ‘‘quite dangerous.”

“Particularly going over to Randolph-Macon,

ned to exchange ideas and allow new EC members to ask

questions of the current committee.

Communication with the student body will be an
important part of next year’s EC, all three officers
agreed. As secretary, Webb will be responsible for hand-
ling the minutes at EC meetings. These, along with an
agenda for meetings, are two ways in which he hopes to
inform the student body of the EC’s activities. He feels
the job is a two-way street, however, and hopes to bring
ideas into the EC as well as report them through the

minutes. .

A lot of the inside jokes and lack of seriousness that
have been common in the EC minutes are unnecessary,
Webb said. Caruthers agrees. ‘‘I think the minutes
should definitely be serious because that’s our only way
of communication with the student body,”’ he said. ‘‘And
although we may try to break the monotony of meetings
in here, I don’t think that should carry over into the
minutes because people don’t know how to take that.”’

An issue that has been discussed recently is the pro-
posal to add an ad hoc woman member to the EC next
year, providing that a woman is not elected. Among the
Big Three, there is a rift regarding this question.

Webb favors the appointment of a non-voting woman
to the EC if one is not elected. It is important, he said, to
maintain the ‘appearance of fairness’ in honor mat-
ters. If a woman is accused of an honor violation, Webb
thinks she should have someone on the EC she can talk
to, rather than having to face a committee of all men.

Caruthers and Lewis disagree with Webb.

“I’m not for overcompensating or tokenism,”’ Caru-
thers said, adding that he is “‘strongly against”’ the pro-
posal. There is nothing that precludes a woman from be-

Spanton explains wasted taxes

 

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

“Of the $150 billion spent each year
on defense procurement, almost one-
third of that is wasted on excessive
costs and billings and goes straight
down the drain.”

That’s what former defense audi-
tor and ‘‘whistleblower’George R.
Spanton told those in Lee Chapel on
Tuesday was happening to their tax
dollars.

In a speech sponsored by the jour-
nalism department and the Washing-
ton and Lee chapter of the Society of
Professional Journalists, Sigma
Delta Chi, Spanton said the Depart-
ment of Defense and the major de-
fense contractors are depriving the
country of the maximum defense
possible because of excessive costs.

“These greedy individuals [de-
fense contractors] are destroying our
country through economic blackmail
and they know it and continue to do
it,” he said.

Spanton told the audience of nearly
200 that defense contractors dictate
terms to the Defense Department,
which will accept whatever they ask.
“T’ve yet to see a general say, ‘It’s
too expefsive, don’t buy it,’”’ he
said.

Because government military con-
tracts usually are for several years,
the threat of contractors’ overspend-
ing f very real. Yet even when they
do go over their planned budgets,
contractors still expect to get paid for
these additional expenses, Spanton
said.

Spanton used General Dynamics,
the makers of the Navy’s new attack
submarines, as an example. He said
that when the cost of each submarine
went over budget by $50 million, Gen-
eral Dynamics just passed that cost
on to the Defense Department.

Because the military ‘‘desperate-
ly’’ needed the submarines, it was

Sweet Briar or Goshen, for example, the roads are
very hazardous,” he said. “I try to caution fresh-
men every year during orientation about the
hazards of the roads around here.”’

John said that until this weekend, it had ‘‘been
some time”’ since the last fatal wreck involving a
W&L student. ‘I’m frankly surprised we don’t
have more of them,’’ he said.

“On occasion, we’ve had one every year for
several years in a row,”’ he continued. ‘‘We’ve
been very fortunate in recent years, but when we
do have one, that doesn’t erase the tragedy of that
one.”’

“T think students often have a feeling it can’t
happen to them,” he said. “I think it takes
something like this to make us realize it can hap-
pen to us and to me individually.”

John said that one key to keeping students alive
is keeping them off the rural roads and in Lex-
ington.

“That is one of the major reasons behind
building the pavilion — to have events here on
campus rather than driving to Zollman’s on nar-
row, winding roads,”’ he said.

He added that coeducation might have a similar
effect. ‘If in fact Washington and Lee males date
Washington and Lee females, I think there’d be
more of a tendency to date on campus or in the
vicinity rather than having to travel an hour or so
for a date,” he explained.

John was asked if the dangers of drinking and
driving are very high in the consciousness of W&L
students. ‘‘I really don’t think so,’’ he said. ‘‘I wish
they thought about it more.”’

“Perhaps there has been some consciousness

willing to pay any additional costs to
get them. Spanton said the govern-
ment always would give in because
the contractors would otherwise re-
fuse to give up the completed wea-
pons,

In effect, ‘‘General Dynamics is
holding the government and the peo-
ple hostage with regard to our na-
tional security,” he said.

These excessive costs came from
‘‘overhead business expenses” added
on to production bills, according to
Spanton. Everything from golf trips
to vacations, chili cookoffs to
political donations and excessive
salaries would be added to govern-
ment contracts, he said.

While the rest of the country was in
an economic slump, contractors such
as Pratt and Whitney would be pay-
ing employees 15 to 25 percent more
than other comparative companies,
Spanton said. Pratt and Whitney had
more than 100 employees with sal-
aries above $100,000 at one plant
alone.

Executives were allowed to rent
cars to go to and from work. These
rental cars turned out to be BMWs,
Porsches and Mercedes. Officers
then would use their personal cars
for going to work and these rentals
for private use. Later, they would
buy the rental cars after their value
had depreciated.

Spanton, as an auditor, was to un-
cover this and other unnecessary ex-
penses. Yet, he said auditors and the
Department of Defense often were in
cahoots.

When he first began to audit the
Harris Corp., for example, he found
that auditors could have possession
of only half the accounts. When he
questioned this, Spanton was told,
“It’s all right, we've done it this way
for 25-30 years.”’

The life of a ‘‘whistleblower,”’ as
told by Spanton, is not an easy one.
He gave examples of attempts by his
employers, the Defense Contract

give some serious thought to finding other”’ social
rules, he added.

Associate Dean of Students Dan N. Murphy,
though, is uncertain that the party restrictions are
pushing many gatherings into the country.

_ “I don’t know if that’s the case or not,”’ he said.
“‘T have not gotten the feeling that there are very
many more parties outside the city limits.”

Rockbridge Sheriff S.M. Reynolds said sober
students should be able to negotiate county roads
with little difficulty. “If they go out tanked up,
that’s when you get into trouble,’’ he said. ‘‘But for
normal driving, there should be no problem.”

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton also defends
local roads. ‘‘The majority of the people who drive
these roads do not have accidents,” he said.
“Occasionally a deer will run out in front of a vehi-
cle and an accident can’t be avoided, but other-
wise accidents are not necessary.”

Like John, Sutton is doubtful that the hazard of
drinking and driving is a hot topic among stu-
dents. “It’s rarely discussed,’’ he said.

He said the police department offers a drinking
and driving presentation that explores ‘‘the legal
and physical aspects”’ of driving under the influ-
ence of alcohol and provides a general orientation
to the drunk driving problem.

Sigma Nu is scheduled to view the program
tomorrow. Sutton said the presentation is
available to any fraternity or other group.

Sutton said wearing seatbelts is critical because
“the body can become a missile inside the car
under certain conditions.”’

“The seatbelt provides safety from the stand-
point of keeping you from going through the wind-
shield,’’ he explained.

A mandatory seatbelt law for Virginia would be
a good idea, in Sutton’s view. ‘‘Anything for safe-
ty,” he said.

Sutton offered some possible solutions for a stu-
dent who needs to get from point ‘‘a’”’ to point ‘‘b”
but is intoxicated.

“Get somebody else to drive, call a cab or walk
— but don’t drive,’’ he said.

Sutton had a final word of advice: ‘The roads
here are not superhighways, and they should not
be driven as such.”

He even pointed out that Special
Counsel William O’Connor, responsi-

said, “If you stick your head out, they

Yet Spanton said his actions and

former cadet

Virginia Military Institute on
Monday filed a $16,000 suit against
a former cadet for damage to a
statue of Gen. George C. Marshall
ina 1981 fire.

The civil action says Keith W.
Kuelz, of Blacksburg, on Feb. 28,
1981, intentionally threw gasoline
around the base of the statue, ig-
nited it and started a fire that did
“substantial and extensive da-
mage’’ to the statue.

Kuelz was enrolled at VMI from
the fall of 1979 through the sum-
mer of 1981. He did not graduate.

Bernard J. Natkin, VMI’s attor-
ney, explained the four-year delay
in the action. ‘‘They’ve been try-
ing to get the individual to pay the
damages voluntarily, and he
hasn’t done so,”’ he said.

Mental errors cost
lax; Terps win,11-5

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Words such as courage, physical,
intense and competitive describe the
way the Washington and Lee lacrosse
team played against the University
of Maryland last Saturday on Wilson
Field. Although the Generals lost 11-5
to the Terrapins, the game was by far
the best outing of the Generals’
young season.

The Generals’ record now stands at
1-2. But if they had capitalized on a
few more situations, their record
easily could have been 2-1.

“Despite the final score, we played
our best game of the year,” said head
coach Dennis Daly. ‘‘The final score
was not an indication of how close the
game really was.”

The first half was anything but
close. The Terrapins scored three
unanswered goals in the first 15
minutes. The first two tallies came
from sophomore attackman Brian
Willard, who was like a thorn in the
side of the Generals’ defense all day.

With 9:23 left in the second quarter,
the Terps raised their lead to 40
when freshman attackman Tom Bed-
ard made it to the net. But less than
three minutes later, the Generals’
senior Sandy Brown finally gave the
3,232 fans in attendance a goal to
cheer about, making the score 4-1.

With two minutes left in the half,
the Generals had the ball again. The
offense slowed the tempo down, look-
ing for what would be the last shot of
the half. But the Generals lost the
ball, and the Terps moved down the
field quickly and scored to lead at the
half, 5-1.

Most people in the stands felt that
when Maryland scored its fifth goal,
it was the end of the game, but Daly

Undefeated
team stays
‘on track’

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Washington and Lee track
_ team is undefeated after completing
the first week of its outdoor schedule.

The Generals are 3-0 overall and 2-0

in the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-

ence.

Commenting on the team’s perfor-
mance last week, head track coach
Norris Aldridge said, “‘The team is
doing about as well as I had expected
for this time in the season.’’ He added
that although the March winds make
it more difficult for his athletes to run
their best times, they have turned in

' good performances at both meets.

On Saturday, the Generals opened
their schedule with a home victory
against Davidson. W&L defeated its
NCAA Division I opponent by a score
of 106-37.

Tuesday, the Generals traveled to
Bridgewater for a three-way meet
that also included Eastern Menno-
nite. The meet marked the Generals’
first outdoor competition against
ODAC opponents. W&L won the meet
with 96 points. Bridgewater placed
second with 61 points and Eastern
Mennonite finished last with 19.

Despite the winds on Tuesday,
freshman Andy White set a new
school record for the 110 high
hurdles. His record time of 15.20
broke the previous record held by
captain Chris Ives (15.50). Aldridge
also cited Chris Bleggi, Mark Pem-
hroke and Chris McGowan for out-

“{Goal] number five didn’t give
them any more or any less momen-
tum,” he said. ‘‘At half, we didn’t feel
that goal was any more a nail in the
coffin than any of their other goals.
Weslid at aninopportune time.”

Indeed, the second half brought a
new lacrosse game as the Generals
seemed to be sharper than during the
first half. The third quarter provided
perhaps the Generals’ finest mo-
ments of the 1985 season to this point.
Senior Mark Knobloch scored after
three minutes with the help of senior
Rod Santomassimo to close the gap
to5-2.

With 7:08 left in the third period,
the theme to’’Rocky”’ could be heard
faintly. Junior Caulley Deringer as-
sisted Brown (five goals this season)
through the tight Maryland defense
to make the score 5-3. Eight seconds
later, Richard ‘Taz’’ Schoenberg
won the face-off, passed the ball to
Bill Holmes, who passed to senior
Jeff Mason for the score. With the
scoreboard showing Maryland's lead
at only 5-4, the theme song became
louder.

The people in the stands became
very excited, stamping their feet and
exchanging high fives. Maryland was
in a bad situation — momentum was
with the Generals.

But then Washington and Lee be-
gan taking bad shots, and the fourth
quarter was the property of the Uni-
versity of Maryland. The Terps took
a 7-4 lead with 10:41 left in the game,
and the fat lady started warming up.

{Goals} six and seven hurt us,”
Daly said. ‘‘They took us out of what
we were doing and let [ Maryland ]get
their confidence back.”

The Generals did close the gap to
7-5 when junior attackman Todd
Breithaupt scored. But the worst mo-
ment of the game was only one min-
ute later when the Terps’ Kevin Hart

 

 

scored to make the game 8-5. It
wasn’t so much the goal, it was the
fact that Hart is a defenseman/mid-
fielder with a long stick that hurt.
Long sticks are not supposed to
score.

“Biggest goal of the game was
their eighth,” Daly said. “Whenever
a long stick scores, it has the effect of
two goals.”’

From there, the Terps went on to
score three more goals to win 11-5.

players and Coach Daly agreed that
Maryland won the game with its
transition attack. When the Terps
beat the Duke Blue Devils 8-6 the
week before, they showed no signs of
a strong transition game. Saturday’s
result may have been due to the fact
that the Terps were just the faster
team, outrunning the Generals over
and over again.

Deringer, who had two assists, was
player of the game.

‘‘T could not take Chip Gist because

The Washington and Lee baseball
team opened its 1985 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season in not so
desirable fashion this week, losing to
Eastern Mennonite College and
Bridgewater College to extend its los-
ing streak tofive games.

The Generals, who won their first
two games, are now 2-5 on the season.

W&L traveled to Bridgewater
Tuesday only to find that its pro-
blems at the plate would continue to

_ Plague the team. The Generals were

unable to hit with any consistency in
the 5-0 loss.

Bridgewater scored all the runs it
needed to win in the third inning, us-
ing two hits off W&L starter Kirk
Breen to push one run across the
plate. Bridgewater added three
insurance runs in the sixth and
scored once more in the seventh to
make the final score 5-0.

Breen continued to be the
Generals’ hard luck story for 1985 as
he allowed only six hits and two earn-
ed runs in seven innings before being
relieved by freshman Carter Steuart.

The Bridgewater loss proved to be
especially costly to the Generals as
red-hot centerfielder Hugh Finkels-
tein injured his knee during the first
inning and will be out for at least two
weeks. W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said Finkelstein may have suf-
fered cartilage damage to his knee.

W&L’s game at Eastern Mennonite
on Monday featured two of the
ODAC’s premier pitchers in the
Generals’ Billy White and the Roy-
als’ Doug Byler. Byler controlled the
Generals throughout, allowing only
four hits while striking ont 14 White,

however, gave up a big first inning,
surrendering a three-run homer en
route to spotting EMC an early 40
lead.

EMC continued to pour it on the
Generals in the second, scoring three
more runs to blow the game open.
EMC tallied once more in the sixth,
making the score 8-0, before adding
insult to injury by scoring eight runs
in the seventh and eighth to make the
final score 16-0.

White suffered his first loss of the
season, allowing six earned runs in
54% innings. Dave Howard relieved
White.

W&L dropped a doubleheader at
home to Alderson-Broaddus on Satur-
day by scores of 8-2and5-0.

In the opener, W&L got on board in
the first when Milam Turner walked,
stole second and scored on Bill Cur-
tiss’ two-out double, giving the
Generals anearly 1-0 lead.

A-B tied the game in the third and

went ahead 2-1 in the fourth. The
Generals fell behind 3-1 in the fifth
when Steuart gave up a two-out home
run.
W&L closed the gap to 3-2 in the
sixth when Finkelstein singled, stole
second, went to third on a passed ball
and scored when Curtiss grounded
out.

A-B put the game on ice in the
seventh, however, by scoring five
runs on four hits and a General error.
Only one of the four runs was earned.
W&L was unable to score in the bot-
tom of the seventh, making the final
score 8-2.

In the second game, W&L once
again was unable to get untracked at
the plate, producing only two hits in
losing 5-0.

They added insurance runs in the

Schoettelkotte worked five innings,

Breen pitched two innings in relief,
giving up one unearned run.

Despite his team’s apparent col-
lapse in the last week, Murdock re-
mains optimistic that W&L can com-
pete for the ODAC title in 1985.

“After seeing Bridgewater and
Eastern Mennonite, I’m still convinc-
ed that we can compete with any
team in the conference;’ Murdock
said.

‘We get behind, and people feel
they have to make the big plays to get

us back in the game,” he added.
‘“‘That’s when we screw up.”

“You've got to relax to play the
game of baseball,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘I
think we’ve forgotten it’s a game.”’

Chances are that the Generals will
treat their next opponent, Hampden-
Sydney, as more than just a normal
game. Murdock said the Tigers are
similar to the Generals.

“They've got a lot of kids back
from last year, and they’ve started
the season like we have,” he said.
“There is no team in the conference
that we can just show up and walk
over.”

This afternoon’s game at Hamp-
den-Sydney was scheduled to start at

Netmen go 3-1, 5-2 overall

 

By LEIF UELAND
Staff Reporter

 

Under clear skies and a blustering
wind, the Washington and Lee tennis
team last week continued to demon-
strate its talent and determination
with sound victories, although it also
encountered some frustrating de-
feats.

Having defeated Indiana Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania 8-1 on Thursday,
Greensboro College 7-2 on Sunday
and Emory and Henry College 8-1 on
Wednesday, the netters lost to Ro-
chester 6-3 on Friday, bringing their
record to5-3.

The team gave an indication of the
extent of its depth against I.U.P. with
victories from non-starters Jim Mor-
gan, Layton Register and David
Nave, who occupied the number 4, 5
and6 positions for the match.

Freshman Chris Wiman was also

successful in his transition from
number 5 singles to number 3 singles,
where he downed his opponent, 6-2,
6-2.

Friday’s loss to Rochester, ranked
five below W&L in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches’ Association poll,
was a big disappointment, team
members said.

Senior captain Andy Haring felt
that although it was an important
match, hope is. not lost. ‘‘We still
havea shot,” he said.

Wiman had similar sentiments. He
pointed out the importance of the
team’s match in Florida against
Rollins College.

Although a loss, Friday’s match
was close, as were the team’s other
three season defeats. In singles, both
Andy Haring and Scott Adams con-
tinued to play well, showing the
team’s overall strength with vic-
tories at the number 4 and 6 posi-
tions.

 

Rivalry

 

C Continued from Page 1

The Cavaliers’ head coach is as
free with praise as Gillin. “‘W&L cer-
tainly has the capability of playing

' good lacrosse and is playing good

lacrosse,’’ Adams said.
The Generals come into Saturday’s

; contest with a two-game losing

ral

silty ili on Si

streak, having been outscored 30-10
in their last two outings. But the team
is not discouraged. Daly and his
troops are working every week ‘‘to
become one week better.’’ And
despite last week’s 11-5 loss to
Maryland, the Generals are pleased
with their overall performance.

“With 60 minutes of good lacrosse,
I think we can beat U.Va.,” San-
tomassimo said.

While Santomassimo and his team-
mates are emphasizing four strong
quarters, 60 minutes of good lacrosse
seems to have been the Achilles’ heel
for the Cavaliers. In their opener
against Brown, U.Va built a 6-0
halftime lead only to escape with an
8-6 victory.

It was the same story the following
week against the University of
Maryland-Baltimore County. The
Cavs went up 9-0 on the Retrievers
but had that lead diminished to 17-12
by the end of the game. Yesterday,
the Cavs collected their third win
without a loss, a 120 victory over
Roanoke.

The Generals are focusing on the
Cavs’ transition game as a key in
Saturday’s contest. U.Va. has one of
the better transition games of the
teams W&L will face this season.

But there is talk that this year’s
Cavaliers are not as strong as

previous editions. Despite their 12
returning lettermen, the team is
quite young. Witness these words,
which open the 1985 U.Va. lacrosse
press guide: ‘‘This season’s lacrosse
team is so young that Jim Adams
...almost has to have introduction
sessions at each practice.’’ Fourteen
U.Va. players are new to Charlot-
tesville.

But this game obviously goes
beyond the numbers. ‘‘We’ve had a
long and good relationship with
Washington and Lee, and we want to
keep playing,’ Adams said.

Gillin concurs with his mentor.
“It’s definitely a rivalry. I’m looking
forward to the game. I know it will be
a good game, and I’m just hoping
we'll come out on the upper end.”

For W&L, the rivalry goes beyond
any pep talk. ‘It would be an upset,
but I don’t need to say a lot to the
kids,’’ Daly said.

That unspoken intensity is re-
flected in the words of his seniors,
who have yet to beat a U.Va. team
during their W&L careers.

“It’s not just an ordinary game.
It’s an emotional game with a cross-
state tradition and rivalry. It’s the
big boys of U.Va. versus the little
boys of Washington and Lee,” senior
attackman Mark Knobloch said.

Apart from the rivalry, the seniors
have the better interests of the W&L
iacrosse program as a whole on their
minds. ‘‘It is a very important game
as far as rebuilding our respectabili-
ty as a Division I lacrosse team,”’
Knobloch said.

In recent years, W&L has come up
short in the big games. Santomas-
simo perhaps best puts Saturday’s
meeting in perspective for the W&L
seniors, and maybe the whole team.

“It’s our last chance. Period.”

The matches that could have made
the difference were those of number 3
man Roby Mize and number 5 man
Wiman. Mize controlled his opponent
in the first set, winning 6-2. After los-
ing the second set 6-4, Mize tried to
re-assert his dominance, but his op-
ponent, Eric Lipton, was also playing
well, keeping his lead in the third set
towin the match.

Wiman also had a close match, los-
ing the tie-breaker on the second set
to drop the match 7-5, 7-6.

W&L’s victory over Greensboro al-
so had its share of close confronta-
tions. Perhaps the most exciting
match was David McLeod’s victory
over Bryan Humphreys. After split-
ting their first two sets, McLeod was
able to show determination in classic
form, winning the tie-breaker of the
third set, 7-5.

Mize and Haring also showed de-
termination, both winning their mat-
ches in three sets. Jack Messerly at

the number one position continued to
go winless, while Scott Adams’ unde-
feated streak was kept alive.

Going into the Emory and Henry
match, the team was somewhat al-
tered, having Messerly at number 3
with McLeod at number 1 and Mize at
number 2. The change came after a
request by the frustrated Messerly.

It was a move that got immediate
results — Messerly got his first win of
the season against Emory and Hen-

ry. Asked how he felt, Messerly sum"

med it up with one word: ‘‘relieved.”’

The match went well for everyone
except in number 3 doubles, in which
Mize, who sprained his ankle toward
the end of the match, and Adams lost,
7-5, 6-0, 7-5.

The team will play George Mason
tomorrow. Approaching are such
teams as Lynchburg College and
Hampden-Sydney, which coach Gary
Franke said will be important for the
team’s ODAC ranking.

Croquet: ‘party sport’

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

When the word ‘‘croquet” is men-
tioned, one probably thinks of the
game that is played in the backyard
ona hot summer’s afternoon.

But according to senior John Za-
briskie, who, with Brook Loening, re-
cently won the National Collegiate
Croquet Championships, the game
they play is ‘nothing like your
backyard croquet.”

Zabriskie and Loening, an ex-
change student from Connecticut
College, competed in West Palm
Beach, Fla., March 1, 2 and 3, taking
trophies for the best collegiate team,
best doubles team and the two best
singles players. They competed with
teams from schools such as Navy,
Brown, Princeton and St. John’s.

Zabriskie explains that competi-
tive croquet, ‘‘the fastest growing
sport in the country,”’ has many dif-
ferent characteristics from the com-
monly played backyard sport.

Competitive croquet was brought
from England to the United States in
1977. Played on a large open court of
grass very similar to a putting green’
competitive croquet has a long list of
complicated rules, and the mental
condition during the tournaments, as
Zabriskie said, ‘‘gets really tense.”
He describes the game as a combina-
tion of ‘‘billiards, putting and chess.”’

This month’s tournament was a
‘‘good time,”’ according to Zabriskie.
He described the game as ‘‘a great
party sport,”’ saying that two main
activities are playing and drinking
gin.

“The girls from Trinity, who tra-
veled with the Trinity team, were
great,’’ he said, and ‘‘the Navy guys
were cool.”’

On the serious side, Zabriskie re-
called that although the competition
was intense, he and Loening ‘‘went
down there to kill.”’

They seem to have accomplished
this, taking first place titles in nearly
all the events. Asked what made the
W&L team dominate, Zabriskie ex-
plained that they won because of
their superior strategy, tournament
experience and knowledge of the
complicated rules.

Competitive croquet has a rather
elite reputation as being a sport for
only the rich. Zabriskie said this
reputation has persisted because
most of the croquet courts can only
be built and maintained at the most
expensive polo and coutnry clubs. ‘‘I
want people to keep an open mind,”
he said.

As for the future, the two-man
team will ‘‘lie low’’ and practice until
they are ready to compete nationally.

The number of people playing cro-
quet is growing every day and Za-
briskie encourages everyone to try
the game.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 21, 1985, Page 7

George & Bob U.

athletes are
students first

....[t was with a little bit of trepida-
tion that I perused last week’s Phi
sports section (all right, more than
the usual amount of trepidation),
especially the ‘A day in the life
of...’ swimming story. The idea of
such an inordinate amount of time
spent by the swimmers in Page
. Remillard’s quality program was, at
first glanee, well, uh, inordinate. We’re dealing with your basic 17-
hour-a-day commitment, here.

I’m sure the gripe from some unmentionables is, ‘‘Hey, that’s too
much time spent for a program that isn’t big-time. Division III means
no scholarships, so why so much time and effort for something that
leads to no professional career? Here, it’s supposed to be ‘Academics
first, athletics second,’ but the swimming program makes it look like
it’s the other way around.”

Frankly, that’s a half-cocked response. The athletic program and
athletic philosophy here at W&L is something of which everyone
should be most proud. There are quality athletic programs at W&L,
and ‘quality’ goes beyond won-lost records and champions produced.

What makes the W&L program — and I’m sure many others like it in
Division III — so worthy of admiration is its foundation in the idea that
nobody is going to make a career out of throwing a ball through a hoop,
into a net or to another magna cum prima donna. Prima donnas need
not apply. Good students are going to get in to Washington and Lee and
will succeed at whatever they wish to do. In the best of all possible
Washington and Lees, applicants would not get in solely because they
were good athletes, and I’d venture to say that’s predominantly the
case.

The point is that athletes at George & Bob’s Colonnade of Fun are
students first. And because they are students first, it is their decision
how much time they devote to extracurricular activities. That goes for
the swimmer and, believe it or not, the Ring-tum Phi reporter. The 17-
hour days are not limited to the W&L athletes, yet the types that would
be quick to point the accusing finger at athletics’ occupying too much
of a student’s day would remain oblivious to the other extracurricular
ventures that might occupy a student’s time.

The dedication of the W&L athlete is something that pays off after
any cheers they might have received have died down. W&L is not in
the business of producing successful athletes. It is in the business of
producing successful people, and the athletic program is one of the
building blocks toward becoming a successful person.

The athletic commitment is a matter of choice. Those early morning
swim sessions were optional. It is something chosen because that is
what the student-athlete wants to do. It is that endless pursuit of
perfection, that striving to be the best you can be, reflected in the at-
titude of this year’s lacrosse team. It’s a quality to be commended,
because, frankly, it breeds quality...

....Again, we make the trip down the Colonnade, and here's a quick
guess that four good quarters would have left Maryland wondering
what hit them....They should make the track and field slogan this
year, “Take no prisoners.” (See Davidson, 106-37, 15 of 17 first
places)...

....On to Real World 101: First pupil this week has to be Doug Flutie,
formerly of the incredible pass fame, now of the incredible sack and
interception(s) fame. But then what are USFL saviors for? The league
is impressive in one statistic. In failed saviors, they are three for three
(see Walker, Rozier, Flutie)...It would be a shame if Larry Holmes
left boxing after such an unexciting finish. (Who or what is David
Bey?) Something tells me, though, he’s not finished...Take a gander, if
ESPN gives you a chance, at those NCAA hockey championships. A
mite more exciting than your usual ESPN fare....

....5some quick NCAA tourney notes: La. Tech and Loyola are still
there. G-town’s had it too easy, and Loyola doesn’t practice layups in
pre-game warm-up. Says Ramblers’ (I believe this is their nickname)
coach Gene Sullivan, ‘With the Patrick Ewings and the Jon Koncaks
in there, you don’t get a lot of layups these days.”’ Practical. You have
to like that...Here’s a nasty guess that tapes of Dick Vitale and Bob
Ley for umpteen hours on ESPN over the weekend will be shown to
prisoners of war in the future.....

....Finally, from the Excellence in Sports Journalism (A contradic-
tion in terms?) Dept.: Headline in The Washington Post on Sunday,
“Maryland defeats William and Mary, 11-5." But gee boss, the
headline fits.....

ot band to ‘scorch’ pavilion

 

Jason and the Scorchers will play in the student activities pavilion tomorrow night.

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

Don’t miss Jason and the Scorch-
ers tomorrow night at the student ac-
tivities pavilion — they are simply
one of the hottest bands in rock and
roll today. They are touring in sup-
port of their first full LP, ‘‘Lost and
Found”’ the followup to their 1984 EP,
“Fervor.”

Led by Jason Ringenberg, this
Nashville band has a sound that the
College Media Journal’s New Music
report has called ‘rock-country,”’
largely because of the out-front gui-
tar work of Warner Hodges, Perry
Baggs on drums and Jeff Johnson on
bass complete the quartet. Their new
album has zoomed to the top of the
progressive radio charts, and the
press has had nothing but raves.

They have a video of the album’s |
single, ‘‘White Lies,’’ that CMJ faults
for not effectively transmitting the
band’s “‘full throttle live aura.” It
recommends seeing the live show,
which will turn an ordinary rock and
roller into a Scorcher convert.

Songs to listen for both at the show
and on WLUR-FM: ‘White Lies’’; »
‘Last Time Around,” their version of _
Dylan’s ‘‘Absolutely Sweet Marie’;
and my favorite, ‘‘Harvest Moon.”’ »
Tickets are $3 each at the bookstore ,
or at the door. Show time is 9 p.m.
with Shor Patrol kicking off the even- *
ing. Once again, kudos to the SAB for
giving us some of the most vital rock
and roll acts today. Keep it up! :

Number of flicks to pick increasing

 

By PETER BOATNER

The past few months at
Washington and Lee have seen a ra-
pid growth in the number of film
series being held around campus. In
addition to the more established film
festivals sponsored by the politics
and journalism departments and the
W&L Film Society, film series aimed
at specific groups such as foreign
language, history and even science
students have begun to emerge.

Several factors account for that
growth. The main one, according to

tance of the University Library’s
audio-video department. ‘‘We have
an active A-V department’ with

‘more centralized information than is

available to the individual depart-
ments of the University, he said.

The library has increased its video-
tape collection over the last year to
such an extent that officials say there
aren’t enough video machines to
meet the demand.

The library, however, only pur-
chases tapes that will be used many
times over, such as the plays of
Shakespeare or science series like
‘Nova’ and ‘“‘The Ascent of Man.”
Specialized films are much cheaper
to rent, the library staff says, and the
A-V department performs that ser-
vice for most of the film festivals on
campus.

“We are trying to encourage use of
the A-V center,”’ said Grefe.

Money, he explained, can be saved
by such centralization through vol-
ume discounts and by searching for
the cheapest rental outlet. Most of

PUT US TO THE TEST:

the film rentals are paid for through
the A-V department.

Craig W. McCaughrin, a politics
professor who has been sponsoring
films here since 1982, said one of the
big factors in the growth of film on
campus has been cooperation among
the groups showing movies.

For instance, by showing a Russian
language film with political over-
tones such as ‘‘October,’’ attendance
increases and money is saved.

Similarly, the film series highlight-
ing the of the Japanese director can
show a movie he made in Russia,
once again increasing audiences and
cutting costs.

Communication also has kept the
schedules of each festival from con-
flicting, MeCaughrin reports. The
Washington and Lee Film Society,
which tries to concentrate on highly
acclaimed contemporary films that
aren’t likely to come to Lexington’s
theaters, has been operating on cam-
pus for about eight years.
