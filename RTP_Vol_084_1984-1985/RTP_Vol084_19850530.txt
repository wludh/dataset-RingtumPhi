5 P.E.s? No debts? You can graduate

 

By JON THORNTON

As graduation nears and expectations of life
after W&L arise for nearly 300 seniors, a few ‘‘non
academic forces’’ conceivably could prevent a
handful of seniors from receiving those coveted
sheepskins

Since freshman orientation and their initial
meeting with faculty advisers, students have been
warned about one of these requirements — that
they must pass five physical educ..tion courses in
order to graduate. The University Catalogue
specifically states that ‘‘degree requirements in-
clude five physical education activity courses.”

Associate Athletic Director Richard Miller said
that in his 33 years at W&L there have been ‘“‘about
a half-dozen cases’ of students’ failing to
graduate because of unfulfilled P.E. require-
ments.

“There has been no one in the past five or six
years who failed to graduate because of insuffi-
cient P.E.s,”’ Miller said. ‘‘No one in this year’s
class will fail to graduate because of it; there were
some who were close.”’

Miller said there seems to be a correlation be-
tween the students who performed poorly academ-
ically and those who did poorly in physical educa-
tion classes

“If you're a borderline student over there [in
regular courses], then you’ll probably be a poor
student over here,”’ Miller said.

Cutting classes is the major culprit, according
to Miller, who added that ‘about 95 percent of the
student body received a ‘B’ or better in P.E., but
you have to go to class.”’

The problem of student procrastination in fulfill-
ing the P.E. requirements has become worse in re-
cent years, Miller said. ‘About 75 seniors are tak-
ing P.E. in the spring term to finish their require-
ment, and one student is even taking three P.E.s,”’

he added.

Miller said students can be excused from phys
ical education requirements if they have certified
medical excuses, but this is the only valid reason
for not participating in P.E. Some students in the
past have been caught purchasing medical ex-
cuses in attempts to avoid the physical education
requirement, Miller added

Financial factors also can result in a denial of
the sheepskin. The University Catalogue again is
explicit when it states that ‘‘if amounts owed the
University are not paid, the University may with-
hold a student’s grades; withhold transcripts;
[or] withhold the granting of a degree and the is-
suance of a diploma to graduating students.”

Registrar Harold S. Head, retiring this year
after 19 years at W&L, says students are ‘notified
and warned”’ by the business office or the Regis-
trar’s office if they owe the University money. A
card-file is kept on such things as unpaid parking

Making more use of the University computer

new University Registrar, appointed last week
to replace Col. Harold S. Head, who is retiring
after 19 years.

The new registrar, D. Scott Dittman, 31, has
been registrar at Muskingum College in New
Concord, Ohio, since 1982. He was selected
from about 70 applicants for the position, ac-
cording to Dean of the College John W. Elrod.

 

Sept. 1.

Dittman’s undergraduate degree in compu-
ter science from Colgate University was one of
several factors that led to his being an attrac-
tive candidate, said Elrod, chairman of the
search committee.

Elrod also cited Dittman’s experience as re-
gistrar at Muskingum, a 1,000-student liberal
arts college, and his ‘‘very high marks’’ from
the provost and dean of students there.

The Board of Trustees last
weekend approved a new drug policy
for the University and authorized the
spending of nearly $3.5 million for a
variety of projects intended to im-
prove campus facilities, administra-
tion officials said this week.

The board also appointed a sub-
committee to study the University’s
policies with regard to investments
with companies or banks doing busi-
ness in South Africa.

University President John D. Wil-
son gave the board a petition signed
by 342 members of the University
community asking the school to
consider withdrawing support from
companies that do business in South
Africa. The petition had been pre-
sented to Wilson by representatives
of the Washington and Lee Campaign
Against Apartheid.

C. Royce Hough III of Jacksonville,
Fla., will chair the subcommittee,
which will include two other trustees,
James F. Gallivan of Nashville,

At the year’s final Interfraternity
Council meeting, President Jaimie
Hayne warned that twe or three fra-
ternities likely will be victims of the
school’s move to coeducation

“Everyone needs to realize that
within the next five years, the num
ber of men will be reduced,”’ he said
“There will be about 1,000 men and
500 women. With 65 percent of the
men pledging fraternities, that
means there will be 300 less men in
the fraternity system.”

“‘Let’s face it: It is fact that two or
three houses are going to go under,”’
he continued. ‘‘We need to get a high
er percentage of men in the system.

Hayne also assured the IFC that
the Board of Trustees is not attemp
ting to dissolve the fraternity system

‘They are reviewing the whole sys

OPINION
Farewell

All year, I’ve vowed to myself that I would resist the temp-
tation to write an editorial in the final newspaper of the year
— after all, it seemed so high-schoolish.

Now that I’m in my final week as a Washington and Lee
student, though, I’ve succumbed to the temptation. They
don’t let newspaper editors speak at graduation, so this
seemed to be my only opportunity, and I wanted to take
advantage of it.

This weakening of my resistance also was spurred some-
what by a comment made recently by a friend, a Hollins
graduate who was at W&L for a year as an exchange student.
Talking about the well-known statement that the college
years are the best four years of our lives, she said, ‘“They are
good years, but they’re not the best.”’

One reason my college years may not have been the best is
that I’ve failed to take advantage of the numerous opportuni-
ties available here. Washington and Lee offers so many uni-
que opportunities, yet I seem to have spent four years in Reid
Hall and the Ring-tum Phi office.

There are so many things I regret not doing during my four
years:

eTaking a course from Sid Coulling.

*Going to Goshen more frequently.

eTaking a course from J.D. Futch (although I probably
don’t own enough ties).

eTrying to write an honors thesis.

eSeeing Southern Comfort more than once (at last Wednes-
day’s Senior Night).

eDouble-majoring.

eSpending a spring afternoon with the children at R.E. Lee
Memorial Episcopal Church.

Living in the country.

eTaking more road trips.

Our University — and, indeed, the surrounding community
— offers such a variety of opportunities that there always
should be plenty to do. We often complain that ‘‘nothing ever
happens in Lexington.’’ In fact, nothing could be farther from
a truth. Lexington has a concert series that cities 10 times its
size would be proud to have; several good theater produc-
tions each year; and Division I football and basketball teams
(not to mention lacrosse and water polo).

Bored? It hardly seems possible. Go to the library and read
The Village Voice, take a professor to lunch in the Cockpit or
spend an afternoon at Liberty Hall with a good book and
some suntan lotion.

The years here are too short to be whiled away. Parties are
fun, and schoolwork takes up a lot of time (or at least is
designed to), but there’s more to college life than academics
and social events. The students who realize this will get the
most for their tuition and probably will be prepared better for
the future.

Those of us leaving behind professors and classrooms,
lacrosse fields and Goshen, to enter the “‘real world’’ must
remember that in whatever we do, wherever we go, we take
Washington and Lee with us. In our pursuits, as at Washing-
ton and Lee, we must always seek to do our best — we can ask
no more of ourselves. If we fail to do our best, we will have
failed Washington and Lee. If we do our best, Washington and
Lee will have succeeded.

In addition to our sheepskins, we take more tangible
aspects of W&L with us. The Honor System here has guided
us through four years of college; why not let it guide us
through the remainder of our life? Our Honor System is by no
means perfect, but I think we could agree that if everybody
lived by it, the world would be a much nicer place.

Greeting a stranger you pass on a busy city sidewalk — just
as you would the same stranger if he were on the Colonnade
— undoubtedly will brighten that person’s day. And in the
‘‘real world,”’ they’ll even let you wear ties.

Because each of us takes so much from Washington and
Lee, I believe this school has a greater impact on us than any
other university would. This is only accurate, though, if we
use our W&L experience after we leave Lexington and live by
W&L’s ideals for the rest of our lives.

We can do much worse than living by those ideals; I would
be more than happy to do so. My four years at Washington
and Lee have been good — I’ll never forget taking courses
from professors Mollenhoff and Smith, occasionally partying
too much and studying too little (and sometimes vice versa),
eating ice cream at Sweet Things, watching the lacrosse
team almost upset North Carolina with the infamous “‘Ar-
madillo” offense, taking late-night study/party breaks at
Lloyd’s, enjoying the history of Lexington and the beauty of
the surrounding area, searching for Lost Cities of Gold and
waiting for the Robert E. Lee at Fancy Dress, watching the
sun rise over Liberty Hall on Easter morning, and of course,
co-editing The Ring-tum Phi.

I will remember — and draw on — these experiences for
the rest of my life. My four years at W&L have been en-
joyable, but they haven’t been perfect. I sincerely hope my
friend’s statement proves true — after all, if this has been the
best four years of my life, what’s left?

Best offense is good defense

 

By N. RADCLIFFE PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

When I accepted the responsibility
this year to write editorials for the
paper, I relished the opportunity to
express opinions. I love controversy,
especially when it somehow involves
me.

But throughout the year, I learned
that controversy isn’t always that
romantic. Writing about your friends
and even your enemies with the
power of the newspaper name behind
you brings a trememdous responsi-
bility. It seems at times the editorials
have become an exercise in offending
as many people as possible. While I
am not prone to compromise, I don’t
enjoy the controversy it always br-
ings either. Sometimes I deserve it.

But despite the displeasure and
grief, I plug away at the Kaypro com-

puter every week, along with the gag-
gle of other Phi writers, trying to con-
tribute some important thoughts to
the direction of opinion on campus.

But thinking of such topics and de-
vising clever ways to hide my ideas
does not allow me to write what I
would really like to say. This column,
therefore, is dedicated to those loose
ends I have wanted to scream and
shout about but which I have so far
left untouched.

Foremost, I am tired of student
and faculty apathy in support of
members of the W&L community.
More than any other year, I have be-
come disillusioned with public atten-
dance at University-sponsored
events. Whether athletic events, Con-
tact speakers, department guests or
visiting lecturers, unless the event is
over-advertised (I am glad there is
no limit on Contact posters) or man-
dated by a professor, attendance has

Student body president
reviews policy changes

To the Editors:

I would like to convey my impres-
sions of the recent change in the
chatging policy of the Bookstore and
last weekend’s meeting of the Board
of Trlistees.

On behalf of the student body, I am
expressing our appreciation for
President Wilson’s thoughtful con-
sideration concerning student
charges in the Bookstore and Supply
Store.

After several students confronted
me about the change in the charging
policy, I had a two-hour meeting with
Mr. Epley and Mr. Eversmann, a
one-hour meeting with Tidge Roller,
the Bookstore manager, and finally
an hour meeting with President
Wilson. The arguments and logic
behind the change did not seem con-
sistent with the overall policy of
trust, respect and freedom which is
so much a part of our community.
The decision was made from a purely
cash flow standpoint which in itself,
although a well-thought-out and
honest attempt to improve the
University’s financial position, was
not benefiting the University as
much as it was hurting the flow of
money through the Bookstore and the
privilege of the students.

After thoughtful consideration and
many questions, President Wilson
took action within an hour of our
meeting.

On another note, a vote of con-
fidence and concern for students’ in-
terests was the general theme run-
ning throughout the Board of
Trustees’ meeting last weekend.
They reaffirmed their commitment
to student self-government and their
absolute support of a strong fraterni-
ty system.

Tom Touchton, chairman of Cam-

Crediting

To the Editors:

Last week’s headline for the article
concerning the 1984-85 Athletic
Awards presented at the all-sports
barbecue makes a rather blatant
omission, which unfortunately tends
to reflect the prevailing attitude in
society today. Each year the Athletic
Department presents four major
awards to recognize outstanding per-
formance, both on and off the field.
However, the headline only makes
mention of those who are ON the
field. Admittedly, these individuals
are more familiar to those who follow
their exploits, so why not put the
eyecatching names at the lead of a
story, since nobody knows the names
of those who do not always play or
work behind the scenes anyway?

It would seem to me that the
answer is quite obvious, but most
often is not the case. Every sporting
event is a team effort, not only re-
quiring the participation of the
players, but also coaches, trainers,
managers, grounds crew and a host
of others. Without ALL of these peo-
ple the package would be incomplete.
Therefore, Dick Morris, as the reci-
pient of the ‘Lefty’ Newell Award
for outstanding service by a student,

pus Life Subcommittee of the
trustees, said that student self-
government is a privilege he ab-
solutely believes in and condones as
long as the actions of students are
responsible and thoughtful.

The Board believes that elevating
Student Control in power and role is
consistent with our policy of self-
government and was grateful to Bob
Tomaso for his reasoned minority
report regarding drug use in the dor-
mitories.

Also, they support the coed com-
mittee’s plans to let all freshmen
choose their own hall parietals in the
beginning of orientation week and
then take a second vote three weeks
later.

Regarding fraternities, the Board
adopted a general policy statement
that replaces the Wednesday night
party restrictions. SAC will recon-
sider this year’s rules and adopt
alternate rules for next fall.

Also the Board adopted a general
policy statement regarding frater-
nities only after President Wilson
critized the use of some unduly harsh

language in one of the policy:

statements. He felt the terminology
was threatening to the fraternitty
system and felt it did not convey the
attitude that the administration or
board wanted to endorse. As a result
of his and others’ reasoned
arguments, the policy statement was
altered. Echoing the sentiments of
the board, Wilson said that the frater-
nities play an integral role in the life
of W&L. The board supports a strong
fraternity system and will do what is
necessary to make sure that they
continue to be strong.

heroes

should have been afforded the same
24-point mention given the other
three gentlemen.

It is unfortunate that those who
perform the ‘“‘thankless’’ tasks
associated with athletics, or any
other profession for that matter, are
so often ignored. Most of those behind
the scenes accept the fact that they
will not often share in the limelight.
Often their primary sense of ac-
complishment and satisfaction is
realized through the success of those
they support. Athletes do, on occa-
sion, recognize the contributions
made by support personnel, and if
unprompted, a small pat on the back
can go a very long way. It does not
take much to motivate someone who
has demonstrated a genuine concern
for a program. If the program did not
matter, they probably would not be
there, but to sense that their
presence does not matter makes for
an often frustrating association. If it
boils down to giving credit where it is
due, then so be it, because those who
occupy the limelight would appear
rather insignificant if there was
nobody to turn it on.

Class of 1985

proven meager at best. Ut course,
there are those departments whose
members conspire to require atten-
dance from all classes within the
department, and all in attendance
then are privileged to hear pompous
professors pronouncing pithy tidbits
of perplexing praxis. Really, how
many students (or for that matter,
faculty) would attend a lecture on the
price of rare espionage works from
the reign of Genghis Khan unless it
were required?

But the problem does not lie mere-
ly within the topics discussed. There
is a deeper cause, one which 1am ata
loss to diagnose. Why don’t students
attend Glee Club concerts? Why
don’t faculty ever attend Contact lec-
tures? Why is it that theater perfor-
mances do not gain the laud they de-
serve? Are we as students unable to
applaud our peers? Is the faculty
guilty of hubris not allowing them to
mingle any more than necessary
with students? What matters is
whether faculty and students alike
really don’t give a damn about sup-
porting others in their quest for
recognition. A speaker paid $4,000 by
Contact or an economist from The
People’s Republic of Massachusetts
are most likely deserving of the same
intellectually curious crowd. As a
university community, we ought to
begin to share the concerns of most
real communities and address the
question of apathy. i be.

Silence, the song says, like a can-
cer grows.

Another concern I hold for the Uni-
versity’s future is the danger pre-
sently posed by the well-meaning but
frightfully misguided intentions of
the anti-apartheid movement on
campus. While they attempt to culti-
vate anathema for the repressive re-
gime in South Africa, they conven-
iently forget the equally — if one dare
talk in degrees here — tyrannical
despots in the Kremlin, Hanoi,
Phnom Penh anu Addis Ababa. If the
basis for action upon the petition
presented to the trustees this past
weekend is out of concern for the
human rights involved, the petition
misses the mark. We might as well
be sure the University divests itself
of any stocks in companies doing bus-
iness with or investing in countries
ruled by equally repressive regimes.
That thought I cherish.

MY VIEW

By B. Scott
Tilley

 

 

 

As the Class of 1985 prepares to
leave the hallowed red bricks and
white columns of Washington and
Lee, amidst the spectrum of emo-
tions each will experience — from
joy to sadness to uncertainty —
each of us should deal with
another question: What mark
have I left behind?

In a finite world, man has an in-
born desire to leave something
behind — “‘to leave his mark.’’ It
makes life meaningful. If we can’t
live forever, let’s make our
memory live forever. Thus, we
find ouselves in a society of
memorials.

And at a school like this, where
we revel in the legacy of Gen. Lee
and many of the giants of the
school’s rich history who are
venerated through portraits,
plaques and buildings named in
their honor, the conscious ques-
tioning of ‘“‘What am I leaving
behind?’ is very real.

The question takes on extra
significance now for the Class of
1985 as we prepare to leave our
four-year comfort zone to enter in-
to the less secure “real world.’
The response, though, must be
viewed as more than just an ego-
booster or ego-buster.

Indeed, as we leave this tran-

 

 

My last view

I do not want merely to demean
those involved in the anti-apartheid
petition. Surely, their intentions are
sound, their beliefs moral. However,
the credibility of their cause has been
sufficiently weakened because of the
absence of certain key countries
from the petition as to call into ques-
tion the validity of the petition. Why
not ask the Soviets also to comply
with the Sullivan principles or else no
trade? Suddenly, it becomes easy to
bully those smaller countries over
which we exert some control. The
day anti-apartheid protestors line up
in front of the Soviet embassy and de-
cry the long history of civil rights
violations and make appointments
for being arrested at their conven- -
ience, I will take up my placard and -
march along with them. Until then, I, -
and hopefully the University as well, -
will kindly decline their invitation to -
political or economic action.

Tied to this issue are the recent -
charges of racism that have been -
hurled about campus. It is easy to.
state one’s opinion about who is a -
racist and who is not. It is another -
matter altogether to try to overcome -
any real or perceived problem. :

Finally, and perhaps with the -
greatest glee, I ought to talk about -
the direction this paper has taken -
this year. As a student who has work- -
ed on The Phi for three years, I know -
Chief Editors Bruce Potter and Mike -
Allen have done an outstanding job. -
The change in format, innovations in :
layout (kudos to Reade Williams °
too!) and a keen eye to editing and :
better writing have established a pre- -
cedent none will findeasy tofollow. .

Ihave defended the paper this year -
before questioning peers while I have -
many times simultaneously question- -
ed the decisions the editors have -
made, Those who read the paper —
rarely know the many hours of sleep
forsaken needed to get the paper out ~
on Thursday afternoon. Few take the -
time to see the effort expended in -
editing and assigning and the calling
and following up on stories and
checking the facts. Bruce and Mike
deserve the credit for all the gain,
and for those times when judgment
might be questioned or subordinates
flub up, they take all the blame. I am
glad they took the time to begin the
search for excellence. They have
made great progress.

sitory stage, the mark we leave
behind is a reflection of the men
we are. What comes out is a
reflection of what is on the inside.

This then is an important
evaluation point for us, In seeing
what kind of impression we have
left on those around us, we can see
which attributes are our strengths
and which are our weaknesses,
and how we want to become better
men in the future.

Washington and Lee has done a
lot to mold us in our four years
here. Hopefully, it was for the
good. Honor, magnanimity and
gentlemanliness are those at-
tributes that we should have ab-
sorbed that will result in positive
marks later in life.

As for me, I, too, hope that I
have left a mark here. Ten or 20
years from now, when you see my
picture while reminiscently flip-
ping through an old Calyx, I hope
you don’t remember me as Scott
the Columnist or Scott the
Republican or Scott the Student.
Rather, if I have left a mark, I
hope it is as Scott, a guy who loved
Christ and tried to reflect that
love to others.

To those of you who remember
me for a smile, a listening ear or
helping hand, hopefully in it you
caught a glimpse of Christ and his
love. That is the attitude Gen. Lee
strove to exemplify and that is the
best mark one can leave behind.

And if you did not see these in
me, understand that I am only
human. I, too, am looking at what
I left behind to see how I can
become a better man in the fu-
ture.

‘“‘He may be the Big Brother, but I have the better view’: Ten-year-old
Matthew Lonas sits atop the shoulders of sophomore John Riordan.

Brothers reach out
to community kids

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

Glen Jackson gets a few startled
looks when he introduces people to
his little brother Travis.

The reason for the raised eyebrows
is that Glen Jackson is white while
Travis Jackson is black.

Actually, the Jacksons are not
related. Until October, they had
never seen each other. But they have
become ‘‘brothers’’ in a very special
sense of the word.

The Jacksons are participants in
the Big Brother-Little Brother pro-
gram at Washington and Lee. The
program pairs a W&L student with a
boy from Rockbridge County from a
fatherless home to provide a mature
male influence for the boy.

The elder Jackson, a senior from
Atlanta who heads the program, ex-
plained that it is meant ‘‘to reduce
the estrangement between the col-
lege and the community” by bringing
W&L students into contact with local
people.

“Being a big brother provides a
way to give something back,’’ he
said. “It shows that the same people
who are getting all the parking
tickets in Lexington are the same
people who are trying to help the
kids.”’

‘Our program is unique because it
has our students in the community,”’
he continued. ‘‘It’s an example of our
students reaching out to a bigger
area than the University.”

Other big brothers share Jackson’s
view.

Nick Cromwell, a senior who
volunteered to be a big brother as
part of a psychology course he was
taking, said, “I knew I would get
more out of it than just one point for
extra credit. It was a chance to help
myself and someone else.”’

Cromwell said his experiences with
his own brothers also were a part of
his decision to be a big brother. ‘‘It’s
great to have an older brother who
helps you with problems and things,”’
he said.

“Instead of doing something im-
personal, like selling raffle tickets
and raising money, this is a way tobe
involved with someone,” said John
Riordan, a sophomore.

“T have a little brother at home,
and I knew there were kids here who
needed the same type of guidance,”’
he added.

“According to Jackson, providing
guidance is a very important func-
tion for the big brother.

“It’s pretty common for the parent

to have to work a lot of long hours to
support the child,” he said. ‘‘Most of
the time, the child is home alone and
so he doesn’t get proper supervi-
sion.”’

Jackson said that in looking for big
brothers, he wants people who are
willing to be role models. The
qualities essential for a big brother
are honesty, good morals and a
desire to spend time and energy with
the little brother by taking him to ball
games or movies, or just watching
television.

Jim Kerr, a junior, said it helps the
parent to have someone take an ac-
tive interest in the child.

“The little brother gets supervision
and learns things he normally learns
at home,’’ he said. “There is a
chance to see that there is nothing
wrong with studying, working hard
and being polite.”’

Senior Chris Fulton agreed.

“After a few months, you see how
you are rubbing off on them. The
more an adult is around, the more the
child picks up,”’ he said.

Riordan added that the supervision
the little brother receives from his
big brother is different from the kind
he gets from his parent.

“Being with their big brother gives
them a chance to be free and relax,”’
he said. ‘‘They don’t have to worry
about being yelled at for a mistake.”’

Fulton said there are times when
the big brother must be a discipli-
narian.

“You never know how much of a
role to play. But there are situations
where you may have to scold the
child,” he said. “You never know
when todo that.’’

The big brothers say they also get a
lot out of the program.

According to Jackson, the big
brothers get involved with people
from a_ different socio-economic
background.

“They get.a look at the real world,”
he said, ‘‘and it gives them a chance
to learn how to give.”’

Cromwell said the program had
taught him not to prejudge people.

‘‘My little brother was black and I
was a little uncomfortable about
that. After getting to know him, I got
over that,’’ he said.

Kerr said one of the benefits for
him was that he got a sense of
perspective.

“When you’re feeling down on
yourself, it’s good to be around a
young kid,”’ he said. ‘You get a new
view of the future.”’

But it was Jackson who described
the program best.

“It makes you feel good,’’ he said.

IFC may take steps
m to reduce party litter

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

The Interfraternity Council is con-
sidering hiring one or more people
next fall to pick up litter on Thurs-
day, Saturday and Sunday mornings,
according to president Jaimie
Hayne.

The decision is the second IFC ac-
tion concerning fraternity party lit-
ter, Hayne said. Three months ago, a
new rule was adopted that imposes a
$50 fine on any fraternity that is re-
ported as having litter on its property
after 8 a.m. on days after parties.

The fine was officially voted into
the IFC bylaws Tuesday night. Under
the ‘‘conduct’’ section of the regula-

IFC

() Continued from Page 1

Changes to the IFC bylaws approv-
ed Tuesday include:

eFreshmen women may attend all
Rush functions except the eight Open
Houses.

eA fraternity may register no more
than 15 women for any one Rush
Date.

Women are limited to three Rush
Dates at any particular fraternity.

¢Men participating in Rush must
attend at least seven Open Houses
and five Rush Dates, no more than
three of them at the same fraternity.

 

 

tions, it notes that ‘we commit our-
selves to good faith efforts in...the ex-
terior appearance of the fraternity
houses and grounds, which on occa-
sion is an eyesore to others.”’

The litter problem is not a new one,
according to Lexington Police Chief
L.O. Sutton. ‘‘Most of the fraternities
do a pretty good job of picking up af-
ter themselves, but everyone needs
reminding occasionally ,”’ he said.

Sutton said fraternities usually are
given a warning when excessive lit-
ter can be seen on their premises,
after which a summons is issued if
the litter is not picked up.

A spokesman for the Lexington
Public Works Department said no
special effort is made on mornings
after parties.

 

Rush Dates again will last 90 min-
utes.

Bids may not be extended until the
fifth Rush Date and may not be ac-
cepted until after the eighth Rush
Date.

Fraternity Rush will not begin until
the last day of freshman orientation,
a change from past years. Freshmen
arrive on Sunday, Sept. 8, and there
is “no contact”’ until Friday, Sept. 13.
The IFC will explain Rush procedure
in a Lee Chapel session the day
before. Formal Rush continues until
Monday, Sept. 30.

The IFC also approved next year’s
budget. Assuming 870 members (an
average of 51 per fraternity), the IFC
plans to assess each house $5.13 per
member to meet its budget.

Musical chairs?

ful as hoped. Epley, however, said
that Carter V. McNeese and Farris
P. Hotchkiss, directors of the fund,
are optimistic that ‘things will pick
up”’ before the end of June.

The Annual Fund consists of contri-
butions from alumni that provide for
about $1,000 of each student’s tuition.

The operating budget passed for
next year is balanced, Epley added.

Assistant to the President Frank A.
Parsons said most of the $3.5 million
appropriated for capital projects
next year will be used to continue
with plans for a new residence hall,
to purchase a new academic compu-
ter and to construct two additional
athletic fields.

“We'll be spending somewhere in
the neighborhood of $2 million in the
next fiscal year’’ on plans for the pro-
posed dormitory, Parsons said.

Architectural designs of the four-
story, horseshoe-shaped _ building,
drawn by Marcellus Wright Cox &
Smith of Richmond, were studied by
the trustees.

“The board did approve the con-
cept of the new dorm,” said Parsons,
adding that the trustees also request-
ed a modification of plans to reduce
costs.

According to Epley, the project
was not fully approved by the board
because ‘‘we haven’t zinged in yet on
how much it will cost’’ to complete
the project. Several weeks ago,
Epley said W&L likely will borrow
$6.5 million to construct the dor-
mitory.

If it becomes necessary to extend
financing for the project beyond the
amount authorized by the board be-
fore October, when the trustees next
meet, a plan will have to be approved
by Wilson and the chairmen of the
Budget and Audit Committee and the
Investment Committee, Epley said.
It also would have to be approved by
the trustees’ Executive Committee.

The two full-sized athletic practice
fields included in plans for next year
will be located in the open space be-
tween U.S. 60 and the unpaved road

leading from Wilson Field to Liberty
Hall. One of the fields will be used for
field hockey, Parsons said.

He added that other ‘‘nickel-and-
dime”’ projects will ease the Univer-
sity’s transition to coeducation.

The Student Health Center, for ex-
ample, will be modified slightly to
give the medical staff flexibility in
serving women.

Additional campus lighting also is
planned.

A classroom on the top floor of
Tucker Hall is scheduled for renova-
tions to provide additional office
space for increased faculty in the ro-
mance languages department.

In addition, office space is planned
for counseling services in the Student
Center. To make room for this, Par-
sons said the browsing library will be
eliminated from the building.

Other projects include the renova-
tion of restrooms at Wilson Field, the
paving of the Woods Creek parking
lot, construction of storage space at
the Buildings and Grounds complex
and construction of a chemical stor-
age vault behind Howe Hall.

Funds also have been appropriated
for the renovation of the Morris
House and a study of the possibility of
moving the Admissions Office to 32
University Place, next to the Alumni
House.

Also this weekend, the board ap-
proved broadening fringe benefits to
cover the entire University staff.

Currently, faculty members have
their children’s college tuition up to
the W&L tuition fee (minus $100) paid
by the University.

Because of a tax law change,
though, these faculty members
would be required to report these
funds as income. To remedy the sit-
uation, the board extended the privi-
lege of receiving up to 90 percent of
W&L’s tuition fee to all University
staff members with college-bound
children.

The trustees also accepted a policy
statement relating to campus life
presented them by Dean of Students
Lewis G. John, chairman of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee.

“It is our desire that student self-
government should be encouraged
and that a proper balance between
student privilege and responsibility
should be sought and achieved,”’ the
statement says.

“Students must nonetheless re-
main aware that they are members
of a University community whose

traditions, image and reputation can
be harmed by negative actions and
behavior as well as being helped by
positive contributions,’ the state-
ment continues. ‘‘This awareness is
especially important since the
University, lodged as it is within a
larger community, must encourage
respect for local ordinances and law
enforcement and honor the claims of
non-University persons for quiet and
safety.”

The statement will be included in
the 1985-86 Student Handbook.

would not have appointed a registrar
who did not have computer exper-
ience.

“‘We’re not sure just what needs to
be done with the computer over
there,’”’ Elrod added. ‘‘We’re certain
that more can be done with a compu-
ter at a small college.”

Among possible jobs that could be
performed by the computer, Elrod
said, are registration, room assign-
ments, transcripts and grade lists.

He noted, though, that the
University ‘‘doesn’t want to use the
computer just for the sake of using
the computer.’’ For example, al-
though the computer could print and
fold report cards and put them in
envelopes, the University probably
wouldn’t want that to be done
because Dean of Students Lewis G.
John usually writes individual
remarks on the report cards.

‘‘We think that’s very important,”
Elrod said. ‘‘There are little touches
in our system that we want to main-
tain.”’

Dittman said that before he can be-

gin to work with the computer, he
will have to become accustomed to
W&L’s 12-12-44 academic calendar
(two 12-week semesters followed by a
six-week semester, which he called
‘very unusual’’), what he is told is a
“rather complicated’’ set of acade-
mic requirements, and the procedure
of requiring seniors to apply for grad-
uation.

Dittman said he enjoyed his visit to
campus, when he met with the search
committee, the advisory committee,
University President John D. Wilson,
the admissions staff and Head.

“It was a real whirlwind tour,”
said Dittman, adding that he found
the campus ‘‘beautiful...gorgeous.”’

After graduation from Colgate,
Dittman, a native of Canton, N.Y.,
was a Peace Corps volunteer in 1975,
assigned to the Barbados Boy Scout
Association.

In 1976, he returned to Colgate as a
development researcher. in 1977, he
joined the admissions staff at Musk-
ingum, and was assistant director of
admissions from 1979 to 1982, when
he was appointed acting registrar.
He was named registrar the follow-
ing year.

Dittman is a member of the Ameri-
can Association of Collegiate Regis-
trars and Admissions Counselors. He
also has served as adviser to the
Muskingum Christian Fellowship.

In general, all colleges face
some form of racial unbalance
and tension. Usually the smaller
the college, the larger the issue
of racial relations is if there are
minorities on campus. Unfortu-
nately, Washington and Lee
happens to be one of the col-
leges which has problems in race
relations, particularly among
blacks and whites.

The majority of these difficul-
ties in racial harmony entail the
social aspects of the campus,
however, there are many that
pertain to the academics and ex-
tra-curricular activities. Many
blacks feel that relations with
whites in these three areas are
the most aggravating.

William Rhinehart, a junior
politics major, has felt much of
this aggravation since his fresh-
man year and continues to face
the problem. He came to Wash-
ington and Lee looking for a
good, small liberal arts: college.
He found that, and more. “It
was like coming from open
minds to closed ones,” he said.
“I found that a lot of whites had
problems dealing with black peo-
ple.” With the help of friends
and moving out of the dorms,
Rhinehart learned to adapt and
to confront what he calls
“racism.” “People make you feel
inferior sometimes because. of
your color and you feel you have
to prove yourself” he said, and
felt this is one reason why black
freshmen don’t do too well in the
first semester. “Some whites
think that all blacks are the
same... they think they all act
the same like they do on TV.”
He points out that black students
are more diverse geographically
than whites here.

Senior Bryan Johnson felt
that his freshman years changed
his perception of the college.
Coming from a predominantly
white neighborhood and prep
school, Johnson says he looked
at people as individuals before
coming here. Yet, when he con-
sistently saw and heard himself
referred to as a certain race and
became a “black” student, not a
student, “I started treating them
the same way,” he said.
Consequently, he felt that he
had to prove himself as a student
and as a black man.

Both students’ undesired
need to prove themselves still
occurs in the form of stereotypes
of blacks by whites. Many agree
that one of the basic reasons
they exist on campus is because
many white have never dealt
with blacks as equals, and gener-
alizations like stereotypes help
some to compensate or under-
stand. Senior head dormitory
counselor Bob Tomaso expres-
sed, “I think there is a good
number of whites here who
never had to deal with blacks or
when they did they [blacks] were
in an inferior position like a maid
or butler.” He explains his un-

derstanding of blacks in that his
best friend, when he was quite
younger, was black. Psycholo-
gist James Worth commented
that the lack of awareness on
whites’ part causes an awkward-
ness around blacks. In turn, this
leads to an inadvertant discrimi-
nation. This inadvertent discrimi-
nation increases the lack ofecom-
munication among both races for
various reasons.

Beyond stereotypes and lack
of exposure to blacks as equals,
some attitudes of the student
body and campus organizations
fail to help in race relations.
Several of those interviewed
agreed that student apathy or in-
difference inhibits black and
white relations. As senior Wesley
Payne stated, “A lot of people
look at it [race relations, black
problems] and say ‘It’s not my
problem, why should I rock the
boat?’.” Sociology professor Ken
White explained, “It’s hard for
many to understand blacks and
their problems here because it’s
not critical to their own exis-
tence, and no matter how much
sympathy is generated, there is
no vested interest.” Sophomore
Glen Lemmon explained the
apathy as follows: “Unfortunate-
ly, there is a faceless white ma-
jority. . . they come to school,
probably join a fraternity, they
go to classes, select a major,
they don’t join any clubs, the fra-
ternity is the only tie they have,
and that isn’t very strong to
them, other than when they're
drunk on Friday and Saturday
night. The only thing they’re
looking for is a good GPA, a di-
ploma and a recommendation
for the [graduate] school or job
of their choice. It’s sick, but it’s
true.” Associate Dean Pam
Simpson commented, “The pro-
blem with a lot of white students
is that the say they’re treating
everyone equal, and yet, in fact,
they are ignoring black students
and they [white students] think if
you're ignoring them, you're not
hurting them.” She stated fur-
ther that white students are un-
aware of how black students per-
ceive themselves being ignored.
That is, they also see their con-
cerns and problems being ig-
nored; too. Journalism professor
Robert deMaria felt there is more
pressure to excel and less
idealism today than when he
was going to school. “There
seems to be more cynicism, but I
can’t blame the parents because
they’re from my generation, and
I really can’t blame the students.
. . but I think the problem needs
to be solved at home.”

In regards to organizations,
Johnson said that difficulties in
race relations occur because
most groups are devoid of
blacks, which makes it harder for
them to view black opinions.
This generates a process of in-
advertent discrimination which
makes an organization seem rac-

 

 

ist to blacks. In turn, they don’t
join the group and its perception
of blacks stays low or at zero. As
a result, the entire process starts
over because once again the or-
ganization has no experience
with black students and seems
racist to them. Many view this as
the key reason why some blacks
can’t or don’t join fraternities.
Black students soon develop a
hatred or indifference to frater-
nities or clubs. “It’s like hitting
your head against a brick wall. . .
most blacks don’t want to have
to face discrimination just to be
apart of something... the price
for getting involved is some form
of harassment.” A hatred or ani-
mosity also develops in the form
best described as “if they don’t
want to associate with our kind,
why should we bother with
them.” Lemmon felt that this is
detrimental to both races be-
cause it only maintains a gap of
communication. Often the black
student feels indifferent to other
blacks, who should act a certain
way to him as a sign of his race.
That is, if a black associates and
adapts the same habits of whites,
he is labeled an “uncle tom” or
some other derogatory remark.
Lemmon felt that his negative
attitude arises when blacks
refuse to assimilate, which is
stressed at W&L. “Blacks want
to maintain their identity and at-
tend the university, but the em-
phasis on assimilation causes
problems for them,” he said.

The Student Association for
Black Unity (SABU) has its share
of problems, too. Designed as a
support group and social gather-
ing for black students, SABU
faces problems of communica-
tion with the W&L community,
social atmosphere and what Fi-
nancial Aid/Minority Affairs Di-
rector John DeCourcy calls
“",.to0 many generals and not
enough soldiers.” Members ad-
mit their faults in leadership and
organization, but according to
Rhinehart, “When we want to
try something that requries a
group effort; we usually put
aside our personal problems.”
SABU has constantly been ac-
cused of acting as a separatist
group, “Because we don’t inter-
mingle in the mainstream of
campus life; we only deal with
the academic sphere,” quoted
Payne who insists he’s heard the
argument as least a hundred
times. He argued many blacks
participate in intramural sports,
hold open house at SABU, in-
vite whites to parties, and their
location compared to fraternities
is much closer to the university.

There are other problems in
race relations which concern the
faculty and administration. One
of the largest problems is the dif-
ficulty in minority recruiting.
Everyone interviewed agreed
that there is a definite need to
recruit more blacks in order to
alleviate some of the racial ten-

sion by making blacks feel less
like a minority or like they are
being ignored. Payne felt that
more recruiting is good, but
there needs to be some kind of
cultural interest for blacks once
they get here. The reason for the
shortage of blacks is they many
choose large ivy-league colleges
or other colleges which have a
more urban area, according to
DeCourcy. A problem with the
faculty is some form of inadver-
tent discrimination, which Simp-
son said comes from, “...the
burden of cultrual baggage that
everyone has and growing up in
a society like ours means that
you have certain assumptions
about people. They’re probably
unconscious, nevertheless, we
carry them.” Several black
students interviewed have re-
ported incidents of racism from
some faculty members. An ob-
vious problem mentioned was
the lack of black faculty. mem-
bers. Many felt black faculty
members would make blacks feel
more comfortable with the ad-
ministration and the faculty in
general. Simpson explained the
problem in acquiring blacks as
professors as a general shortage
and a high demand for them.

What are some solutions to
these pressing issues? Among
the various suggestions offered
there were several which many
agreed and disagreed on for
numerous reasons.

One of them was coeducation
next year. Some, like Tomaso,
feel that coeducation will help
the situation. Most believed
that it will improve communica-
tion and reduce apathy. “It will
make it a lot easier socially for
blacks because attitudes and
people are gonna change,” said
Tomaso. White believes that co-

 

 

 

 

Seniors Wesley Payne and Terry McWhorter discuss a few views on race relations.

education will bring more diver-
sity and more responsiveness
and interest in the classroom dis-
cussions. “I do realize that many
[women] are coming from the
same background as the guys,
but those that rejected the school
because it wasn’t coed, and saw
that as limiting, will bring a cer-
tain social and intellectual life to
different aspects of the campus,
which will, | hope, help the mi-
nority problems,” he said. Worth
feels that the opportunity of
change itself gives blacks a
chance to push for changes
which will be enhanced by the
fact of women on campus who
will also be causing changes.
Others, however, didn’t know
or didn’t think the addition of
women will help the problem of
race relations. Johnson said that
the change will only put blacks
lower on the “totem pole” and
felt it will be harder and easier for
black women than for black
men. “Guys generally speak to
women and the women won't
have too much trouble socially,
but it will be harder because

they're black and leadership po- |

sitions won't be all that open to
them,” he said.

An increase in minority re-
cruiting was another popular sol-
ution offered basically because it
would ease a lot of social tension
and give blacks more reasons to
participate.

According to deMaria, this
would definitely help race rela-
tions. “We need more minority
students who are willing to risk
their reputation and put their
heads on the chopping block,”
he stated. Tomaso agreed in his
statement that, “All it takes is
one or two guys to turn some
heads and give white students a
black-role model to respect.”
Some felt that SABU needs to
Participate more in campus acti-
vities in order to give whites bet-
ter opinions of blacks’ concern.
Sophomore Mike Webb com-
mented that, “Times have
changed and SABU hasn’t and
they definitely need to in order
to get something done.” Several
agreed with Webb’s statement.
“SABU also needs to be a stepp-
ing stone for black students to
get into organizations,” stated
DeCourcy.

Other suggestions offered in-
cluded increased publicity to mi-
norities. Rhinehart advised
increasing mailing to minority

 

students and teachers. Simpson
said that the university should
and may look into the Colgate
Data Base, which can help the
university select certain target
groups for publicity and increase
its potential for acquiring black
faculty. “I think if the university
brought in a qualified black,
which I’m sure they wouldn’t
have any trouble finding, it
would help a great deal, espec-
ially a guy who could teach in
the C-school [Commerce
School].”

A black student-control ad-
hoc member (which means a
non-voting member that gives
advice) was acknowledged by
Rhinehart and Tomaso as good
way to ease black apprehension
towards student organizations
like the Executive Committee.
Others felt that organizations,
SABU, and blacks need to strive
to find a common ground and
stop being judgemental of the
other. “I think it was very hypo-
critical of The Phi to run that
editorial (in May 16th issue) tell-
ing everybody else they needed
to work on the problems of
blacks and whites at W&L when
they have done very little to
help, if not very little, they have
hurt the situation” stated To-
maso. Webb and Lemmon ex-
plained that organizations’ struc-
ture and content usually changes
sometimes and with that more
opportunity for minorities may
arise, and they need to be taken.
They couldn’t agree on who suf-
fers the most when a minority is
refused admission into a group,
but both felt in the end, the
school suffers.

Although there were more
suggestions offered, the pre-
ceding appeared to be the most
plausible. It is important to re-
member, however, that none of
these solutions are new, they just
haven't been discussed openly
for the public. After all, the stu-
dent body is what makes the uni-
versity function and should be
made aware of its problems. The
purpose of this article was to
simply discuss and present some
issues and solutions to the pro-
blem of race relations on the
campus. | feel they must be re-
solved soon before the university
loses all of its appeal to minor-
ities. How do I know it’s losing its
appeal? It lost its appeal to me
and yes, | am a minority.

IVOTE4U: Law grads get
words of Warner wisdom

From Staff Reports

 

Lawyers need to develop perspec-
tive — something they can’t learn at
law school — U.S. Sen. John W. War-
ner, R-Va., told 128 Wa.hington and
Lee Law School graduates Sunday.

When he recommends lawyers for
federal judgeships, Warner said, he
looks for those with three character-
istics integrity, resilience and

perspective.

Warner, a 1949 W&L graduate who
obtained his law degree from the Uni-
versity of Virginia, said the integrity
and resilience can be gained from a

 

W&L education. Perspective, though,
must be learned elsewhere, he add-

ed.

“You have been taught, as was I,
the skills of the profession, the tech-
nical skills that every counselor at
law requires: how to write briefs,
how to research, how to debate, how
to argue a case,”’ Warner said. ““You
have a sound understanding of the le-
gal principles which serve as the
foundation of our society and the
framework of our government.

“That part of perspective you can
be taught. But the larger part of per-
spective you must learn yourself.”

 

“Nice suit’’: Sen. John Warner chats with Arthur Silver, who ran a men’s
clothing store in Lexington when Warner was a student here.

By Cotton Puryear /The Ring-tum Phi

Warner encouraged the graduates
to use their law degrees for more
than making money. As an example,
of the latter, he said a car that
recently swerved in front of him had
‘the license plate, “ISUE4U.”’

“Well, that’s obviously a lawyer’s
automobile, and he’s trying to drum ~
up business. That troubles me,”’ said
Warner, holding up a piece of paper
with the license plate number on it.

“Yes, you have earned the right to
material reward, and you will win
it,”” Warner told the graduates. ‘“‘But
you fail Washington and Lee if that is
your only goal.

“America itself will surely fail in
our quest for the preservation of free-
dom. . . if you, with the finest educa-
tion and proven talent and the per-
spective you have now and will gain,
withhold your full contribution and
pursue ‘ISUE4U.’ ”

Illustrative of the perspective law-
yers need to gain, Warner said, is the
studying he did in preparation for at-
tending the arms control talks. in
Geneva this week with nine other
Senators.

“History is the best of teachers,”’
Warner said. ‘‘It’s the rear-view mir-
ror of life.”

In reviewing the history of pre-
vious negotiations, Warner said he
found an incident in which the
French negotiator, Charles de Tal-
leyrand, was told that the Russian
ambassador to the negotiations had
died.

“T wonder what his motive was?”
Talleyrand asked the messenger who »
brought the news.

“This story reinforces what our

before the trial, Read showed him ‘‘a
photograph and asked me if that was
the man that I had seen in the room.
It seemed pretty clear to me that it
was and I was fairly certain it was.”

Read testified yesterday that he
held a_ pretrial conference with
several of the rape-case witnesses
the day before the trial. Read said
Vawter never saw any mug shots or
viewed a police lineup.

Read told the court his desk was

cluttered with case-related material
during the pretrial conference, which
was attended by the victim, her un-
cle, one of her friends, Vawter,
‘Gilman, Stanford and Steve Best,
another Pika.

Among the items in view, Read
said, were a Lexington’ Police
Department mug-shot book of black
male suspects, pictures of the crime
scene, a floor plan of the fraternity
house, and other pictures and items
he planned to use at the trial.

Read said three of the photos on his
desk were of Tinsley.

Crawford said Vawter’s ‘‘change of
heart’”’ regarding the pre-trial con-

ference and photo identification may
indicate Read knew at the time of the
trial that Vawter’s testimony was
perjured.

If that were the situation, Crawford
contended, Tinsley may have been
denied due process of law.

Crawford, who was not Tinsley’s
attorney at the trial, asked for the
trial transcript for use in preparing
the appeal.

Tinsley’s state Supreme Court ap-
peal was filed May 13. Such an appeal
now would likely be made to the
Virginia Court of Appeals, a newly
created level of the state judicial
system.

Girard seeks to suppress evidence

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The attorney for Washington and
Lee senior Gene Girard asked yester-
day that certain Western Union
money orders be barred as evidence
in Girard’s upcoming trial on a
charge of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute it.

Lexington lawyer Laurence A.
Mann asked in his motion that any in-
formation concerning Western Union
money orders issued in Girard’s
name between Jan. 1 and May 1 be
suppressed as evidence against him.

Girard was arrested March 1 at the
East Lexington grocery store in con-
nection with a Federal Express
package containing about an ounce of
cocaine that was received there on
that day.

At an April 26 hearing, Lexington
and Rockbridge County law enforce-
ment officers testified they received
a tip Feb. 27 from an anonymous in-
formant that Girard had sent a
money order for $1,453 to Miami. The
officers said they then watched for
Federal Express packages to Lex-

ington from Miami.

Mann’s motion says interception of
telephone or telegraph transmissions
is unlawful under Virginia state law.
It further states that the Com-
monwealth claims its case is based
on information from ‘‘a reliable in-
formant,” not from a wiretap.

The motion says Western Union of-
ficials deny giving information to the

 

Commonwealth in connection with
money orders and that Girard knows
of no other possible source for the in-
formation.

Mann presented his motion before
Circuit Judge George E. Honts III.

Girard, who was not present in the
courtroom yesterday, is scheduled to
be tried June 11 in Rockbridge Cir-
cuit Court.

Is that a tort? One law student seems more enthralled
with a bottle of bubbly than he is with the filibuster on

arms control negotiators are faced
with,’’ Warner said.

The brief interlude about the arms
control negotiations was Warner’s
only foray into politics. He did spend
some time, though, praising his
Washington and Lee education.

“T have taken from this University
a treasury of memories,” said War-
ner, adding that he first thought
about becoming a senator when he
met a classmate’s father, former
U.S. Sen. Willis Robertson.

“I wouldn’t be in the Senate today
had it not been for the privilege of at-
tending this great university and re-

ceiving its education,’’ Warner said.

Introducing Warner, Law School
Dean Frederic L. Kirgis Jr., describ-
ed Warner’s attending the University
of Virginia law school as ‘‘a minor
setback in his career.”’

Warner, who served on _ the
University’s Board of Trustees for 11
years, said he had brought with him
his father’s 1903 Calyx — “‘one of our
most treasured family heirlooms.”’

Encouraging the graduates, War-
ner said, ‘‘I assure you, you will suc-
ceed. If I could do it, you will do it.”’

Zola charged with $160 theft

 

By JASON LISI
Staff Reporter

 

Junior William F. Zola was ar-
rested early Tuesday and charged
with stealing a $160 tub of wine from
Spanky’s Delicatessen.

Zola, a 21-year-old from Sudbury,
Mass., is the outgoing president of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Lexington police Sgt. Steven E.
Crowder, the arresting officer, said
in his report that while responding to
a 1 a.m. complaint about noise in
Stonewall Jackson Cemetery, he saw
three males carrying a tub of wine
toward 201$,RandolphStw...._;,

He said in the report that his in-
vestigation revealed that Zola had
taken the items from Spanky’s.
Crowder obtained a warrant and Zola
was arrested shortly after 2 a.m. A
magistrate set bail at $500 but releas-
ed him on his agreement to appear in
court.

The 22 bottles of Almaden Gamay
Rose wine are valued at $160.28. -

Zola’s hearing in Lexington

General District Court is set for June
18. He will appear Tuesday to name
his lawyer.

Petit larceny carries a possible
sentence of up to 12 months in jail, a
fine of up to $1,000, or both.

Other police news this week includ-
ed something that could only happen
in Lexington — the case of the
unidentified flying chair.

You wouldn’t believe it unless it
came from Police Chief L.O. Sutton:

An air conditioning protector at
Domino’s Pizza was broken last week
when a chair was thrown at it from
the apartment of seniors Donald Pal-
mer and George meaner at 25S. Jef-
ferson St,

Palmer and Renee, though, say
they don’t know who hurled the four-
legged projectile.

They have offered, however, to pay
for the damage, which is estimated
at $100.

Also this week, thefts and van-
dalism continued to plague W&L
students. Some recent examples in-
clude:

eSophomore T.J. Finnerty this

week reported his Raleigh 10-speed
bicycle taken from in front of Evans
Dining Hall. The silver bicycle with
blue trim is valued at $175.

eA window in the Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity house was broken at 1 a.m.
last Thursday when an unknown per-
son threw a six-inch piece of wood
through it. Two potted plants were
broken. Damage of $50 was done to
the room of senior Scott Vanmeter.

eSophomore Marquis Smith report-
ed an equalizer stolen from his car,
which was parked in front of the Phi
Kappa Sigma fraternity house. The
left front mirror and the antenna of
the car were broken. The value of the
equalizer is $50 and the other damage
was Said to total $35.

eFreshman Sydney Speer had the
antenna broken off his 1985 Honda
Prelude, Sutton said. The car was
parked in front of the Unviersity
Center. The damage is estimated at
$25.

eJunior Randy Ellis reported the

broken on his car. The damage is es-
timated at $35.

“We have a good class from a good
university hitting a strong job
market.”

With those words, Associate Dean
of Students Michael A. Cappeto ex-
pressed his optimism for this year’s
graduating class.

Cappeto, also University place-
ment director, mailed a question-
naire to seniors several weeks ago in
which he asked about their plans for
next year. Included were questions
about graduate schools and job offers
as well as a question about plans in
general.

The purpose of the survey was to

Liberty Hall:

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A special ceremony at Liberty Hall
marking the 200th anniversary of the
University’s first commencement ex-
ercises will highlight next week’s
graduation events.

Farris P. Hotchkiss, director of
University relations and develop-
ment, described the commemoration
as a “very simple ceremony that will
have two basic purposes.”’

“One, the observation of the 200th
anniversary of W&L’s graduation of
a baccalaureate class, and, two, an
opportunity for the University to give
to each graduating senior a medal-
lion that will mark the occasion,”
Hotchkiss added.

The ceremony, which will take
place Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. at the
Liberty Hall site, begins with a
benediction from John N. Thomas,
former rector of the Board of
Trustees.

Also included are a brief historical
sketch of the school by I. Taylor
Sanders II, University historian, and
a message from University Presi-
dent John D. Wilson.

Medallions then will be handed out
to the seniors, concluding the cere-
mony, which Hotchkiss said will last
about half an hour.

Hotchkiss pointed out that Augusta
Academy and Liberty Hall, which
preceded Washington and Lee, did
have graduating classes prior to 1785.

only 95 of the 300 surveys he mailed
were returned.

The low rate of response made it
difficult to get an overview of class
plans, Cappeto said.

“With a 30 percent return rate, the
results are not accurate”’ as a reflec
tion of the senior class as a whole, he
explained.

Cappeto said he usually does an ex-
tensive survey of the senior class
every two or three years. This is the
first time he has mailed a survey in
the spring.

Of the students who have returned
surveys, Cappeto said, many are go-
ing to graduate schools, particularly
in the fields of law and medicine.
Others are beginning careers, ‘he
said, noting that the most popular

200th anniversary of a commence.

“‘We were the first private school in
the Commonwealth of Virginia to be
chartered and to grant what is today
the baccalaureate degree,’ he
added.

“This will be something mean-
ingful,’’ Hotchkiss said. ‘‘It will be
something this class will be able to
participate in and take away with
them as an important part of their
W&L experience.”’

Other graduation activities include
a baccalaureate service Wednesday
at 11 a.m. in Evans Dining Hall and
the awarding of diplomas to about 300
seniors during the exercises on the
Front Lawn beginning at 11 a.m. next
Thursday, June 6.

The speaker for the baccalaureate
will be the Rev. Peter J. Lee, bishop
coadjutor of the Episcopal Diocese of
Virginia.

Lee, a 1960 graduate of W&L, was
consecrated as a bishop coadjutor in
the Washington Cathedral a year
ago. He previously had served for 14
years as rector of the Chapel of the
Cross in Chapel Hill, N.C.

Following the baccalaureate ser-
vice, the graduating seniors and their
families will be the guests for a
luncheon on the lawn.

After the Liberty Hall ceremony,
the faculty will hold a reception and
dance for the seniors in Evans Dining
Hall.

areas are finance, banking, market-
ing and accounting.

It is not unusual for students not to
have jobs at this time, Cappeto said,
and those who don’t have jobs yet
should not be discouraged

“Because of the diversity of our
student body, we can’t expect every-
one in the graduating class to have
jobs now,’’ Cappeto said. ‘People
who look hard over the summer
should have no problem finding one.
Within a month or two, almost every-
one has a job.”’

‘‘Last year was a very good year’’
for job-hunting, Cappeto said, ‘‘and
not much has changed.”

The role the placement office plays
is one of guidance, Cappeto said.
“The thrust of our efforts is to teach
W&L studerts how to find jobs,” he

explained.

The placement office has several
programs throughout the year for
students looking for jobs. These in-
clude a September meeting for stu-
dents interested in applying to law
schools, a resume-writing workshop
and a career symposium.

Preparation is the key to finding a
job, Cappeto said.

“For those who don’t have a job,
they should know how to find one,” he
said. “For those who aren’t motivat
ed, it's time to get off their ass and
get going.”’

Cappeto acknowledges that W&L is
not the ideal school for easy job-
hunting because Lexington is a dif-
ficult place to arrange job inter
views, and many students have to set
up interviews on their own.

New assistant athletic director leads lunch-time aerobics class

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

It’s noon on a weekday, and one
might expect Washington and Lee
faculty and staff members to be sit-

ting around tables at the Cockpit or in
the Co-op enjoying a leisurely lunch.
For some, indeed, that might be the
case, but for about 25 faculty and
staff members and spouses, it is far
from it.

Instead, they spend their lunch

  

 

hours in the wrestling room of the
Warner Center going through an in-

W&L in summer has something for everyone...

‘A taste of college life’

 

By STEVE CONNER
Staff Reporter

 

Although Washington and Lee of-
fers no summer college credit
courses for undergraduates, the
University does offer summer pro-
grams from June through August for
nearly every other age group.

A total of 16 programs will be of-
fered this summer on the W&L cam-
pus, ranging from the Summer
Scholars session for rising high
school seniors to an Elderhostel pro-
gram for adults age 60 and older.

W&L has offered the Summer
Scholars program each of the past
four summers. The Summer Schol-
ars program is designed to give ris-
ing high school seniors a taste of col-
lege life, according to Robert P.
Fure, director of summer programs.

A total of 120 boys and girls, chosen
from 300 applicants, representing 29
different states will participate in
this summer’s program.

From June 30 to July 26, these high’

school seniors will take courses rang-
ing from English to history to sociolo-
gy. All courses will be taught by 19
members of the W&L faculty.

The average SAT score among the
Summer Scholars students is 1,200
and the majority of the students were
in the top 10 percent of their classes,
Fure said.

The price for each Summer Schol-
ar participant is $1,200. The fee in-
cludes room and board (the students
live in Graham-Lees Dormitory).

The Elderhostel program offers
college courses for people age 60 and
older. A total of 50 will participate in
this summer’s program.

Elderhostel will be divided into
three week-long sessions, with the
first session scheduled to start June
23 and end June 29.

The first Elderhostel session will
offer courses ranging from Third
World politics to the Civil War to
modern art.

The other two sessions will run
from July 21-27 and from July 28-
Aug. 3. Both of those sessions will be
conducted at the Washington and Lee
School of Law, where law professors
will lecture about income taxes,
criminal law, consumer protection
and mass media law.

Fure said many of the Elderhostel

students are retired executives or
teachers, many of whom want to
keep learning new things and ideas.

“The faculty loves teaching these
senior students,” Fure said. ‘‘They
have much to offer.”

The fee for the program is $195.
This includes meals and housing in
the Woods Creek Apartments.

A two-week program is offered for
business executives. About 15 ex-
ecutives from such major companies
as IBM, AT&T and Arco will par-
ticipate in the Institute for Ex-
ecutives, which will take place on the
campus from June 16-28.

The theme of the program is bus-
iness ethics. The total fee for the pro-
gram is $3,000.

The W&L Alumni College Program
will offer this year for the first time a
college program in England. The
tour is offered to W&L alumni and
their families. A total of 36 people
will participate in this year’s sum-
mer sessions.

The topics for the four sessions
are: “Great Writers, Etc.,’’ from
June 30-July 6, ‘Society and Health,”
from July 7-13, ‘‘Classical Athens,”
from July 14-20, and ‘‘Alumni College
Abroad: England,”’ from Aug. 6-23.

The fee for campus courses at W&L
is $400 and $2,200 for the England
course.

A variety of athletic camps are of-
fered during the summer on the cam-
pus. All camps and clinics are coach-
ed by members of the W&L coaching
staff.

There is an aquatics camp in June,
a lacrosse camp in July and three
basketball camps during the sum-
mer. A soccer day camp also is of-
fered.

The camps last for one week and
are open to high school students in
general.

Fure said about 50-100 youth par-
ticipate in each athletic program.
The fee for each camp ranges from
$175 to $225, including meals and
room and board.

An art workshop takes place in Ju-
ly on the campus for the benefit of

of Rankin’s workout have ranged
from ‘‘fun’’ to ‘‘physically challeng-
ing’’ to “‘agony.”’

Rankin said that the course was not
originally her idea, but rather that
she took it over from Athletic Direc-
tor William D. McHenry and head
football coach Gary R. Fallon. The
program initially consisted of a rota-
tion of swimming, weight training
and aerobic dance, but time con-
straints made doing justice to the dif-
ferent workouts difficult, Rankin ex-
plained.

Aerobic dance is helpful in reach-
ing the different target areas of
fitness, Rankin said. The workouts
are designed to increase the strength
of the cardiovascular system as well
as overall strength and endurance.
Emphasis also is placed on flexibility
exercises, some balance activities
and just plain basic coordination.

Rankin started the program by cir-
culating a letter to all faculty and
staff members. She said the response
was surprising.

‘“‘We were expecting 10 to 15 people
at the most, and the first day we had
35,” Rankin said. Not all of those
original 35 have stayed with the pro-
gram; in fact, nine left after the first
session. On the other hand, nine more
have enrolled since the course began.

The participants in the program
seem to be there for different
reasons. Journalism Professor
Robert J. de Maria said his motiva-
tion was the realization that he was
out of shape.

“All those desserts, pastas and
breads build up, and I had really let
myself go to hell,’’ he added.

The course was tough going at first
because of the usual aches and pains,
said de Maria, adding, ‘I was sore in
muscles I never even knew I had.”’

Reference librarian Yolanda War-
ren signed up for Rankin’s course
because its meeting time is more
convenient than the course she was
taking in Lexington. Warren said
that although she already was in fair-
ly good shape, she still benefits from
the course by putting more effort into
each individual exercise.

Robert Fure, director of summer
programs for W&L, has a twofold
reason for taking part in the pro-
gram. First of all, he wants to gain
the physical benefits. Secondly, Fure
said, he enjoys getting to know new
members of the W&L staff and saw
the aerobics course as a chance to get
to know Rankin, who just began her
duties this spring.

Fure said he has been impressed
with the job Rankin has done with the
aerobics class. ‘‘She puts to rest any
assumption that men have more
physical stamina than women,” he
added.

The program is designed to be
challenging to people at all levels of
physical fitness, Rankin said.

Before beginning the program,
each participant figured his heart
rate and used this as a basis for his
progress in the course. This way,
each participant can do as much or
as little as it takes to work on
strengthening his heart rate.

Many of the participants are doing
other workouts in addition to the
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
aerobic sessions, Rankin said. Some
are walking or jogging, others are
swimming and a few are lifting
weights with Fallon.

A course similar to this one is plan-
ned to be offered to the under-
graduate students next year, in addi-
tion to Coach Norman F. Lord’s
aerobic running class.

Stachura

 

more often than not the wins were
upsets, there was a chance, for ex-

' : ample, that David McLeod could
beat the No. 1-ranked singles player in the nation.

And why was there such a chance? Because W&L was competing
in a league of similar foes. Presumably, none of the tennis players
at the national championhips were on athletic scholarships.

The Washington and Lee lacrosse team cannot beat Johns Hop-
kins, and there is no chance that W&L can beat Johns Hopkins. That
inequity illustrates the need for change in the lacrosse program.

W&L striving to compete in Division I is a silly idea. We are now
and will continue to be out of our league ad infinitum in Division I. A
five-minute glance at ESPN’s coverage of the recent Division I
championship will give any doubters enough fuel for reconsidera-
tion.

To continue to compete in Division I is a logical absurdity. Moving
to Division III is a logical decision. Let’s face it. W&L is a Division
III institution. Having one sport buck the institution’s philosophy is
not necessary and doesn’t make sense.

Well, then, why does W&L compete in Division I lacrosse? In 1971,
the decision to play in Division I made sense essentially because
there was no difference between Division I and Division III teams,
save in ability level. In 1971, W&L was competitive with those teams
that decided to compete in Division I. In 1985, W&L is not com-
petitive in Division I.

All right, then, why did W&L choose to remain in Division I? My
educated guess is that when a team vote is split down the middle,
you feel it would be unfair to permanently smite that many young
men. As well, the permanence of a move to D-III is a scary thought
to many. And that type of thinking is unfortunate.

Staying in Division I is keeping a dream alive. A bad dream. To
me, it is not any fun to lose. It does not make me any better to lose
to North Carolina 19-5 than it does to lose to Roanoke 20-6, or UMBC
9-6, for that matter. Losing is not attractive (that’s as in recruiting),
either. No one wants to play for a loser, be he in Division I or Divi-
sion III.

Sure, W&L can play in Division I. There are scads of discount D-I
programs out there. But a 10-1 season against Virginia Techs
doesn’t impress me. Simply put, with the way things are now at
W&L, with no changes in the administration’s attitude toward
lacrosse, success in Division I means a ho-hum schedule.

It has been said that the University does not have a stake in pro-
ducing national champions. Perhaps not. But no one can dispute the
achievements of the national championship swim team or tennis
team. I submit that the W&L lacrossers have been deprived of that
same Satisfaction, simply by being placed out of their league.

I did not enjoy watching lacrosse this season. But then I don’t like
human sacrifice, either. It is not fun to watch your peers go into bat-
tle, for all intents and purposes unarmed.

It is not, by any means, a sign of cowardice to admit that you
don’t belong anymore. It is a sign of unnecessary stubornness to
stay somewhere you don’t belong...

   

 

....AS we head down the Colonnade one final time in 1984-85, I
salute all the athletes this year. Other than providing me with
something to do for the last nine months; you gentlemen have shown
anyone who took the time to notice that athletics — when ‘they ar@
what they should be — are people striving to reach their potential,
and if they are successful, reaching it. Even if they don’t, they go on
undaunted. I applaud your efforts, whether they be on the practice
field or in the championship game, because they have been always
efforts pushed to the utmost of your abilities. And in the end,
regardless of any scoreboard or stopwatch, that iswhere champions
are made...

....1’ll look forward to this nonsense again next year. In the mean-
time, enjoy your summer and remember that they have yet to name
the ladies teams for next year. Sure, they can make the decision to
go coed, but when it comes to details...

‘Active’ women interested in sports program

 

By DAVE NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Seventy-five women who will at-
tend Washington and Lee next year
are either very interested in or are
considering participation in the W&L
athletic program, according to assis-
tant athletic director Cynda Rankin.

The athletic department gathered
this information when surveyed wo-
men accepted for the 1985-86 acade-
mic year. The athletic department
has processed only the responses of
women who have confirmed their ac-
ceptances.

The survey was used to determine
the athletic interests of the women

who will attend W&L next year. Ran-
kin stated that although a woman my
have indicated an interest on her sur-
vey it does not necessarily mean that
she will participate in the athletic
program.

Referring to the women in next
year’s freshman class, Rankin said,
“They seem to be very active in
athletics, student government, dra-
ma and music. We [the athletic de-
partment] will be competing for their
time.”

Rankin further stated that if a
woman expressed interest on her sur-
vey, it does not imply that she has a
background in that sport.

Next year, Washington and Lee
will field women’s teams in cross

Fall schedules boast
a few new opponents

 

From Staff Reports

 

A few new faces dot the proposed
schedules for next fall’s football, soc-
cer and cross country seasons.

The football team jumps right into
its ODAC schedule with its season
opener on Sept. 14 at Emory and
Henry. The nine-game season in-
cludes two changes from last year’s
list. Pennsylvania’s Ursinus will be
the site for a Nov. 9 contest. It will be
the first meeting between the two
teams.

The season concludes with a home
game against Washington University
(St. Louis). It will be the 17th
meeting of the two institutions. The
last meeting was in 1974.

The soccer schedule has four dif-
ferent opponents from the 1984
season. The new foes include season-
opener Shenandoah, North Carolina
Wesleyan, Liberty Baptist and
the University of the South.

The cross country schedule is
much the same as the 1984 edition.
The season includes the Virginia
State Divisions II and III meet, which
will be held at W&L.

country, golf, tennis and swimming
and diving. These five teams were
selected because of the current facili-
ties available and the makeup of the
W&L coaching staff as well as the
interests of theincoming women.

Rankin added that these sports are
individual team sports that will allow
women athletes not only to partici-
pate but also to accomplish indivi-
dual goals despite the level of compe-
tition or number of participants in
the program.

“The sports that were chosen ap-
pear to have been excellent choices,”
Rankin said. Of those responding to
the survey, 37 women said they are
interested in participating in the ten-
nis program, 33 in swimming and
diving, 18 in golf and 17 in cross coun-

 

try.

The survey provided the initial step
in the recruiting of women athletes.
Based on survey responses, W&L
coaches have written or called those
who indicated an interest on their
survey.

The athletic department currently
is scheduling matches and meets for
next year’s women’s varsity pro-
grams. Tennis and swimming and
diving will compete in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference. Cross coun-
try and golf will not.

The survey also asked the women
to express interest concerning possi-
ble future women’s programs so that
the athletic department may best
plan the course of women’s athletics
at Washington and Lee.

Letterman:
He’s just so

Su-sussudio

By The Associated Press

 

 

BURBANK, Calif. — David Letter-
man, a wizard of humor operating in
the witching hour, says he has
something of a cult following.

Letterman is found in the after-
midnight television void usually fill-
ed with such movies as “The Attack
of the Killer Tomatoes,” bizarre used
car salesmen and ads for all those
golden-oldie records you can’t buy at
your local store.

“Late Night With David Letter-
man,” like ‘‘The Tonight Show”’ that
precedes it on NBC, is something of a
catch-all, You never know who's go-
ing to show up or what’s about to hap-
pen.

In an interview during the show’s
first visit to NBC’s Burbank studios
(the show was originated from New
York since it went on the air in
February 1982), Letterman said his
philosophy is, ‘‘Let’s not take things
too seriously.”

The tall, lanky comedian, wearing
shorts, a University of Michigan T-
shirt and a Detroit Tigers’ cap, add-
ed, ‘‘We’re just trying to have a good
time. There are places for thought-
provoking material, but not on our
show. Maybe ‘Nightline.’ It’s really
frivolous. It’s a silly show. And by
design.”

An estimated 5 million people tune
in to the show every Monday through
Friday. ‘‘I think a lot of it is cult,”
Letterman said, ‘‘But cult brings to
mind a curious kind of people living
in tents outside of Barstow. We have
a good cross-section of people. Not
many high school people, because it’s
too late. In the beginning we didn’t

get a lot of older people, either, but
now we are getting more older peo-
ple.”

“Late Night,’’ like Carson’s show,
is taped in the early evening for
broadcast later. Letterman laughs at
the thought of trying to go live as
“Saturday Night Live’’ does.

‘‘In New York at that time of night
you'd get people trying to get warm,”
he said. ‘‘Or looking for a place to re-
load their weapons.”

Until he began ‘‘Late Night,” Let-
terman had lived in Los Angeles.

‘We could have done the show out
here.”’ he said.

But, he explained, ‘I think NBC
liked the idea of using its facilities in
New York and contrasting it with
‘The Tonight Show’ from Los
Angeles.”’

‘Just One of the Guys’

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
“The Back Page”’ Editor

 

What happens when a_ budding
young journalist loses the local
newswriting contest because she’s
young, attractive and female? She
does what every young, attractive
budding female journalist does — she
dresses up like a guy and decides to
write a story about her experiences.

There you have the plot for ‘‘Just
One of the Guys,” the story of Terri
Griffith, a young girl who dresses up

in her younger brother’s clothes to
prove to the world that she has what
it takes to be a reporter.

Along the way she discovers that
her little charade is not going to be
the piece of cake she thought it would
be. She gets confronted by the terrors
of the boys locker room, the proposi-
tion of playing on the ‘‘skins”’ side of
a basketball game and the no-holds-
barred lust of a brunette Madonna
dress-alike who wants nothing more
than to have her way with Terri's
male alter-ego.

Things only get worse from there.
Terry’s boy friend can’t figure out

Letterman originally was sum-
moned here to talk to the NBC af-
filiates meeting, but Brandon Tar-
tikoff, president of NBC Entertain-
ment, suggested that Letterman do
his show from Burbank for a week.

“It’s a different feeling out here,”
he said. ‘‘The first important show I
ever did came out of here. You’re
driving to work on the Ventura
Freeway and you get a shot of
adrenaline just thinking about it. For
me, that’s a real boot. I have nothing
but pleasant memories about work-
ing here.”’

Letterman was often mentioned in
1980 as a possible successor to
Johnny Carson as host of “The
Tonight Show.”’ That was at the time
when Carson could not reach an

agreement for a new contract with
Fred Silverman, then president of
NBC. It was rumored that Carson
might go to ABC. Instead, Carson
signed a new contract.

It was shortly afterward that Let-
terman did his short-lived morning
show for NBC. After its failure, pro-
blems began to develop with ‘‘Tom-
orrow.”’ The show, originally an in-
terview show with Tom Snyder, was
expanded to 90 minutes and enter-
tainment elements were added. But
it wasn’t working.

“Grant Tinker said we don’t need
this aggravation with ‘Tomorrow’
and said let’s put David Letterman
in,”’ he said. ‘‘They had been paying
me a small retainer. Actually, no-
body else wanted me.”’

is just SO Su-Sussudio

why she’s cut her hair off and why all
of a sudden she doesn’t have any time
to spend with him.

Meanwhile, Terri starts to fall for
Rick, the guy she becomes friends
with while she’s dressed as a guy. On-
ly problem is that she persuades him
to get a date for the prom, leaving
Terri to take her best friend Denise to
the prom.

Sound confusing? It’s not really.
More than anything, this movie
comes across as sort of a teen flick
remake of ‘Tootsie’ but doesn’t
come close to being as good.

“Just One of the Guys”’ is mildly
entertaining but if your money is run-
ning tight, save your $3.50 and go see
“Beverly Hills Cop” when it returns
to the State Theatre on Friday.

Plans underway for
Superdance ’86

people in the dancer's ring that
weren't supposed to be there, and.
that hampers us greatly,’’ Whann

said. ;

While the dance raises most of its,
money by pledges made to dancers,
the committee is looking into other‘
ways to raise money for the MDA.»
Last year an additional $6,291 was
raised through beer sales at the’
dance, fraternity contributions and,
faculty pie throws.

Whann said one fundraising event
he sees becoming even more impor-
tant are ‘‘slave auctions’’ held at the
local women’s colleges. Whann ex-*
plained that at a slave auction, W&L +
students are ‘‘sold’’ to the highest
bidder and the slave performs acts of '
“mutually agreed servitude”’ for the +
highest bidder. ;

The actual date of the dance has
been a problem in past years. ‘‘For '
the past two years, we've held the ,
dance when two women’s colleges
have been on vacation,’ James said,
“and that cuts into the number of
dancers as well as the number of
spectators.” :

The 1986 Superdance has been set
for Jan. 24-26.

Whann said he thinks the Super-
dance will get a boost in participation
from the women who will begin atten
ding W&L this fail. :

“These young women will be sear
ching for activities to participate in
next year,’’ Whann said, ‘‘and we feel
we provide a really positive at- *
mosphere for people to work in. We
have fun, but we also raise money for
avery deserving group.”

The Washington and Lee Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance Committee
has already begun plans for next
year’s event, hoping to make it the
most successful in the weekend’s
seven-year history.

Superdance co-chairmen Paul
James and Sandy Whann said a ten-
tative goal of $30,000 has been set for
the 1986 Superdance.

Whann said the fundraising goal is
used as a psychological boost and the
most important thing is the amount
actually donated to the Muscular
Dystrophy Association. Last year’s
30-hour dance marathon raised
$33,213, and after expenses about
$20,000 went to the MDA.

The Superdance Steering Commit-
tee has begun work now, hoping to
find new ways to run the dance so
more money can be given to the
MDA, Whann said.

“What we’re doing is looking at
last year’s dance and dissecting it,”
he said.

Whann noted that the positive
aspects of the dance included in-
creased support from the W&L com-
munity over the past year, as well as
added support from fraternities and
the local women’s colleges.

A real effort is going to be made to
cut expenses, Whann said, but not at
the expense of quality.

A few problems with security were
the only negative aspects that Whann
saw from last year’s dance. ‘‘We had
