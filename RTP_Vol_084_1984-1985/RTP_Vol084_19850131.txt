Williams said.

 

The months of planning and
weekend’s
seventh annual Washington and Lee
Muscular Dystrophy Superdance will
pay off — to the tune of $30,000 if
Superdance officials get their wish.

Chris Williams, chairman of the
Superdance steering committee, ex-
pressed great hopes for the event,
which begins at 8 p.m. Friday in the
student activities pavilion and con-
tinues until 2 a.m. Sunday. With four
bands scheduled and approximately
200 dancers expected, Williams said
this year’s dance could be ‘‘the most
exciting and successful ever.’’

In addition to the dancing and
bands, the Superdance will feature
the annual pie throw in the faces of
selected professors. Groups or in-
dividuals can bid for the right to toss
a pie at faculty members. Those par-
ticipating this year include Edward
C. Atwood Jr., dean of the commerce
school; Wayne M. Dymacek, math
professor; George C. O’Connell Jr.
and Boyd H. Williams, both of the
athletic department; and Hampden
H. Smith, journalism professor.

Along with the pie throws, the
Superdance Committee has planned
other events to raise additional
funds. Cooperation with an organiza-
tion known as Circle K, a liaison to
area women’s colleges and VMI, has
raised about $1,500 from ‘‘slave auc-
tions’ at Hollins and Mary Baldwin
colleges and approximately $500
from raffle ticket sales. These funds
are to be used to help defray the
operating costs of the Superdance,

v While nearly 200 dancers are
partying in the pavilion, two students

Hall.

The Circle K groups are helpful,
Williams said, in making the Super-
dance a true ‘community effort.”
Williams also expressed thanks to
Superdance committee co-chairmen
Darby Brower, David Sizemore and
Charles Stern as well as to the entire
W&L community. He noted that fra-
ternities, freshmen, the food service,
buildings and grounds department,
print shop and others were helpful in
the preparations for the weekend.
“It’s amazing how everybody pulls
together to come through.”

The Washington and Lee Super-
dance is different from many of the
superdances held at other schools
across the country, Williams said,
and W&L puts on a bigger show than
most schools. While dances at places
such as Virginia Tech may feature
‘800 dancers, they usually don’t have
the number of bands or raise the
amount of money that W&L does, he
said.

Washington and Lee raises more
money per student than any other
school, Williams said, and last year
was 12th in the nation in total dollars
raised.

Last year’s total was $35,000, and a
representative from W&L traveled to
Las Vegas for the Jerry Lewis Labor
Day Telethon.

 

$1 million upgrade in store for W&L’s computers

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

More than $1 million may be spent over the
next five years to replace the University’s Har-
ris computer system, according to members of
a computer planning committee.

At its meeting two weeks ago, the Board of
Trustees allocated $310,000 for the purchase of
a central machine by June 31.

The Board will consider funding for the re-
mainder of the committee’s five-year plan in
May, and chemistry Professor Thomas C. Im-
eson II, director of the computer center, said
the five-year plan will cost ‘in excess of $1
million.”’

The University’s current central machine
can ‘‘conceivably”’ service only 20 of the 35 ter-
minals on campus, Imeson said.

“We obviously need to expand the processing
capability of the system,’’ he added.

The new computer system would be funded
by gifts and money the University has put aside

Grad schools

 

from previous years, according to University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley. In addition, about
$1 million in a capital projects fund earns 8 or 9
percent interest in a short-term investment,
Epley said, and this income probably also will
be applied to the project.

The University hopes to order the central
machine by the end of February, receive it in
June and install it during the summer.

Although the new system has not been
chosen, Imeson said the ‘‘prime contenders’’
are one of Digital Equipment Corp.’s VAX
machines or possibly a bigger Harris machine.

“‘Not many other machines would qualify,”’
said Imeson, referring to the systems’
capabilities and costs.

Under the five-year plan, microcomputers
would be installed throughout both the
undergraduate and the Law School campuses,
according to Imeson.

Associate Professor Robert E. Danford, head
cataloger at the University Library and a
member of the policy subcommittee of the
computer committee, said that ‘‘an unspecified

politics, history, business majors

number of microcomputers for word process-
ing and educational software”’ would be install-
ed at the library during the next five years.

“Specific machines haven’t been discussed,”’
he said. ‘‘The computer center will have the
final say.”’

The educational software the University
hopes to acquire for the microcomputers would
relate to specific types of courses, Danford
said. For example, he said, biology programs
now are available for teaching genetics.

“We can expect that more and more of these
programs will be available,’’ Danford said.

The faculty at some colleges and universities
are given the use of computers at low costs, but
in return must create programs that can be
marketed by owners of the computers.

Although such a deal probably will never ex-
ist at W&L, Danford said, such deals will
‘determine the amount of courseware that we
would have’’ available from which to choose.

The library’s central location, popularity as
a study area, 24-hour schedule and routine for
checking in and out resources would be influen-

Job market

tial in the decision to place microcomputers on
the library’s main floor, he added.

Students will be able to use the microcom-
puters for word processing and for term
papers, according to Imeson.

The Harris computer system now used by thé
University was put into operation in October
1977 and has been expanded and enhanced
since then. ;

The system’s ability to service existing stu-
dent demand has been reached, Imeson said,
and no room for expansion exists.

“We have maxed out — if you will — its
capacity and are in need of a more powerful
system,” he said.

The new system will have a substantially
faster processing speed and ‘‘by virtue of that
it can handle more simultaneous terminal con-
nections,” Imeson added.

In the next five years, terminals will be add-
ed to the existing clusters in the Commerce
School, Parmly Hall, Robinson Hall and the
library. A new cluster of microcomputers will
be added in Newcomb Hall.

 

 

Senior resume book:
best sheets forward

News Editor

Students who major in
mathematics, philosophy and

science do better on law and
business school aptitude tests
than do students who follow the
traditional pre-law and _ pre-
business curriculums, according
to a recent survey by the National
Institute of Education.

Arts and science majors are
better prepared to take standar-
dized tests because they are
taught to approach problems with
more structured, logical thought,
said Clifford Adelman, a senior
associate at NIE who put together
the survey.

Math majors outperformed all
other majors on the Law School
Admissions Test and the Grad-
uate Management Admissions
Test in 1981-82, the report stated.
Their scores were 12.8 percent
higher than the average on the
LSAT and 13.3 percent higher on
the GMAT.

Students majoring in the com
mon pre-law curriculums pol-
itics, history and English —did

worse on the LSAT than did math
majors. Politics majors scored 1.6
percent lower than the average,
history majors scored 2.9 percent
higher than the average, and
English majors scored 5.6 percent
higher.

On the GMAT, all business-
related majors did about 5 percent
worse than the average, while
scores for persons majoring in the
humanities, social sciences and
physical sciences all were better.

The 10 highest-scoring majors
on the LSAT and GMAT were, in
order: math, philosophy, engi-
neering, economics, chemistry,
English, foreign languages,
government, history and biology.

The fact that the same majors
consistently led the way in all the
graduate aptitude tests surveyed
supports the theory that those ma-
jors simply better prepare a stu-
dent to take standardized tests,
Adelman said in an interview this
week.

“That has to do with the
knowledge paradigms in their ma-
jors,’’ Adelman said. He loosely
defined a knowledge paradigm as

Money counts

If there is anything that bothers me, it is a person who
seems to have little concept of the value of money. I think
that maybe I, too, fall into that category occasionally,
especially when I receive the phone bill at the end of the
month. But college students often are accused of spending
their parents’ money with little concern for the hard work
behind the faces of Washington, Hamilton and Franklin.

College students, then, seem to have little right to criticize
others’ seeming disregard for hard-earned dollars. But that
seems to be the case, considering the way the costs of going
to school have skyrocketed faster than NASA’s secret mis-
sion. Last week, one rumor going around campus before the
Board of Trustee’s meeting had the Executive Committee
recommending that the student tax (the fee we students pay
for general student activities, i.e. entertainment by the SAB,
the Calyx and The Ring-tum Phi) be raised by $5 for inflation
and another $5 for coeducation. $10 is not much really, con-
sidering the cost of beer in the Cockpit or the ticket price to
see George Thorogood.

But last week, the Commerce Department reported that in-
flation had been at its lowest level since 1967, a measly 3.8
percent rise in the general price level of goods and services.
This past year, the student activities fee was $75, not in-
cluding the $25 paid exclusively for the pavilion. Accounting
for inflation, the increase should be $2.85. Big deal — Let’s
just kick in an additional $2.15 for another two or three bands
during the year. What the heck.

But don’t forget the additional $5 you might have had to pay
to help with the costs of coeducation. That would be $5 for
funding whatever women’s groups decide to ask the EC for
money. Forget the fact that freshmen traditionally have been
sheepish when it comes to entering the EC room, much less
the probability that they can organize themselves and pre-
sent a logical budget request just three weeks into the term.

The student tax has risen at an alarming rate in the past
few years. Two years ago, the EC instituted a one-year tax to
finance the 1984 Mock Convention. This year, despite the
Mock Convention’s running in the black, we each continue to
pay $5 for the 1984 Mock Convention.

So it comes as a great surprise to me, and to many others,
that anyone could recommend an increase in the student ac-
tivities fee for next year. This year’s EC has reported an ex-
cess of funds this year; next year, with a larger freshman
class, more funds will be available for distribution.

Perhaps it is somewhat reassuring that the Board of
Trustees decided at its January meeting not to raise the stu-
dent activities fee. Perhaps it shows that someone
somewhere realizes that an extra dollar on that tax is not
necessarily a dollar well-spent. And perhaps, despite the
trustees’ decision to raise the tuition for next year to $7,100,
there might be some hope for’a future decrease in the ac-
tivities fee.

But at this point, that is all conjecture. It is little consola-
tion that the activity fee has remained the same while tuition
has risen as greatly as it has. Many students contribute
heavily to their college education. Many students work long
hours or two jobs for the money to attend college. Many
students, despite assurances they will receive financial aid,
fail to matriculate because they cannot manage the ex-
penses. And while the Board of Trustees is to be commended
for increasing the pool of available funds for financial aid for
students in need, a greater effort to contain costs is needed.
We cannot continue to increase the financial aid reserve
forever, but we can certainly try to cut the fat until we must
compromise quality.

We recognize the necessity of maintaining Washington and
Lee’s quality, but quality is of no use if no one can afford it.
Any advantage we gain by coeducation is steadily and surely
eroded if we allow costs to rise unchecked. If tuition fees and
student taxes continue to rise, maybe we’ll have to amend
that familiar quote to include three certainties in life: death,
taxes and higher education fees.

Fraternities benefit W&L, community

 

By Brandt
Surgner

Over the past year and a half, the
fraternities at W&L have come under
serious fire from all areas of the
Washington and Lee community.
They have been under attack due to
their physical condition, their inter-
nal organization and their social
functions. It seems to me as if many
of these accusations have been exag-
gerated as well as unfounded. It also
is apparent that no one has taken the
time to recognize the positive aspects
of fraternities and the good they do
for the University.

I would first like to point out that
the fraternity system, as everyone
knows, is an integral part of Wash-
ington, and Lee. Well over half of the
student body are members of frater-
nities and feel as if their fraternity is
an important part of their collegiate

 

life. A vast majority of our student
leaders and varsity athletes are
members of fraternities.

Fraternities are mainly under at-
tack for their ‘‘wild and out-of-con-
trol partying.’’ Many of these com-
plaints, in my opinion, are unfounded
and vastly exaggerated. It is true
that there is a reasonable amount of
“‘partying”’ that goes on at W&L, but
this is one of the aspects of college
life that prepares us for the ‘‘real
world.” If a student can’t make the
logical choice between studying for
his history test or going to a Wednes-
day night party, that’s his fault, not
his fraternity’s. As for the aceusa-
tions of ‘‘peer pressure,”’ etc., to at-
tend these parties, if the student
can’t say NO, that is again his fault,
and there is no fraternity that I know
of that requires its pledges to attend
parties.

It also has been agreed that these
parties cause excessive damage to
the fraternity houses. I can’t imagine
several parties a month being that
detrimental to the physical condition

Letters

of the houses. Each month the frater-
nities must submit a checklist to the
dean of fraternity affairs. Included in
this checklist are provisions to repair
any damages to the fraternity (win-
dows, shutters, doors, etc). Before
the checklist is submitted, all repairs
must be completed, or a penalty is
imposed upon the fraternity. With
such a system, the problems that
may be caused by parties can be
quickly taken care of.

Fraternities also have house man-
agers who are responsible for keep-
ing the fraternity clean and in good
shape. This is yet another step frater-
nities take to make sure their house
looks respectable. As for trash litter-
ing the lawn and streets outside fra-
ternities, the IFC has discussed im-
posing a fine of some sort against
fraternities that don’t take care of
this problem. It seems evident to me
that the University has taken mea-
sures to keep the fraternities in good
physical condition without the need
to limit the number of parties we can
have.

I think it is important now to men-
tion some of the good things fraterni-
ties do for the community. I know of
one fraternity that holds an annual
Christmas party for the neighbor-
hood children. Other fraternities
sponsor fund-raising events for or-
ganizations such as the MDA. Anoth-
er fraternity held a drunken driving
seminar, while others make dona-
tions to charitable organizations.

The fraternities, most importantly,
promote a strong sense of brother-
hood both among members and
among houses. Friendships are made
that will endure way beyond the time
we all have graduated and left W&L.
Itis very important, at this time, that
the fraternities of Washington and
Lee band together and show the com-
munity that we are not just a bunch
of ‘‘wild partiers’’ but that we can be
beneficial to both the University and
the community as a whole.

B. Scott keeps this reader inquiring

ToB. Scott Tilley:

I love to laugh, soI read your week-
ly column in The Phi. ‘‘My View’’ has
remained a welcome study break
throughout the past year. Last week,
however, you really outdid yourself.

While I respect your stance on
abortion, I cannot quite get a grip on
your argument. I guess the key
sentence of the entire discussion was
‘Abortion denies the sanctity of the
very institution we cling to des-
perately as our own dearest right and
liberty.” I wish I could understand.
Could my deficiency in journalism
credits have something to do with my
ignorance? B. Scott, please make an
attempt to write more lucidly so we
who are less knowledgeable than you
can understand your wise and cosmo-
politan teachings.

Wnen wurying to decipher your
message, I often times encounter
another problem. Your examples do
not support or prove your argument
Even a lowly anthropology major as

myself can see that. Last week you
really screwed up. You told us that
abortion is murder and that we
should regain “‘our vision of the long
clung-to American dream.”’ You
claimed that we can see an example
of the ‘American dream” by study-
ing the ‘“Great American Frontier,”
“‘a wild, unconquered west’’ where
men loved sore muscles and callous-
ed hands. B. Scott, I hate to tell you
this, but the saga of the frontiersman
and his flintlock does not send red,
white and blue shivers up my spine.
Does this by chance mean I am a
Communist?

Most frontiersmen, however, did
send red shivers down (not up) the
spines of many American Indians.
See, B. Scott, when blood leaves the
body it is colored only red, not red,
white and blue. President Ulysses S.
Grant, one of the greatest American
heroes, saw his armies fight more
than 200 battles with the Indians dur-
ing his eight-year administration

Adequate ID needed for Pit

To the Editors:

I would like to inform the student
body of the new Cockpit policy
toward those under the legal age of 19
who are caught drinking within the
Cockpit.

Those people who have been mark-
ed with the red stamp meaning he or
she is either under 19 years of age or
did not present adequate identifica-
tion but drink beer, will be asked to
leave the Cockpit immediately.
Unless this person, at a later date,
can show us identification proving
that he or she is 19 years of age, that
person will be banned from the Cock-

ment about us in his last Time Out
column. The Unknown Fans and
Mike Stachura seem. to have one
thing in common: We both like to
make fools of ourselves. The big dif-
ference is that we do it on purpose
while Mr. Stachura seems to do it
naturally. The Unknown Fans are
proud that they try to help out our
basketball team and encourage high
attendance rather than just whining

pit for the remainder of the school
year.

This policy, however severe it may
appear, is necessary to protect our
license to serve beer. I think
everyone is aware of the close

McAlevey ought to re-dress walrus

To the Editors:

In response to Mike McAlevey’s
Jan. 17 article lamenting the am-
biguously concealing nature of
women’s winter clothing, I would like
to pose a few questions.

First, if an ‘“‘empassioned’”’ man
manages to ‘‘coerce’’ a woman to
remove all her clothing and finds her
body is no longer sexually arousing,
can he ask her to redress? Or is this
impolite for a gentleman to do?

-Chernenko: days numbered, professor says

After Chernenko: What’s next?

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Press accounts of the illness of
Soviet leader Konstantin U. Chernen-
ko are probably correct, meaning
that the U.S.S.R. will face major
leadership changes in the near fu-
ture, according to associate politics
Professor Craig W. McCaughrin.
McCaughrin, who joined the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty in 1981 and
holds a Ph.D. from the University of
Minnesota, has traveled in Moscow
and holds an undergraduate degree
in Russian language. He teaches a
course on the Soviet political system
and is assisting in the development of
the politics department’s planned
Moscow spring term program.

“T think he’s ill,” McCaughrin said
of Chernenko this week. “‘I think his
days are numbered. After all, he’s al-
ready living on borrowed time. The
average life expectancy for a white
male in the Soviet Union is 69. [Yuri]
Andropov died at 69. Chernenko is
73.”

“Ironically, that’s [President]
Reagan’s age,” he added. Chernenko
was born Sept. 24, 1911; the presi-
dent’s birthday was Feb. 6 of the
same year,

McCaugbhrin said that although the
Kremlin is very tight-lipped about
Chernenko’s health, the rumor mill
in Moscow provides quite a lot of use-
ful information. “Word from unof-
ficial sources travels very quickly,”
he said. “The problem is that it’s like
the old telephone game — some dis-
tortion sets in.”’

“There’s a vested interest in
convincing the West and even other
socialist states that there’s a regu-
gularized process going on,” he
pointed out.

“The party wants to retain its im-
age that it is the real locus of authori-
ty. It can’t convey any sign of weak-
ness or incompetence. If there were
no outside world, I dare say the So-
viets would still be doing this,’’ he

“the different ways that you and I go
about knowing.”’

‘‘Most of those majors are majors
with strong knowledge paradigms,”
he said. ‘‘That is far less true in the
professional fields.”’

The report, released last week, in-
cluded less data on the Medical Col-
lege Admissions Test than it did on
the LSAT because the MCAT was
revised recently and there is not
enough data for useful analysis.

Adelman said many of the report’s
findings did not surprise him.

“T read (the LSAT’s questions on
logical reasoning) and said, ‘I can

said.

“The party has to sustain as much
support as possible from the popula-
tion te get its program implemented.
If the image of the Soviet leader as
someone who is decrepit and senile
and doesn’t know what's going on
ever gets out, the party’s days would
be numbered,’’ McCaughrin added.
“If you do convey a sense of weak-
ness to the extent that there are
factions in the party you need to hold
at bay, you’re going to be removed
and be replaced by someone who can
do that.”

“‘When the image falters, you’re in
trouble,” he said. “‘Any time that
the certainty of impending doom
emerges, you're finished. That’s the
real danger of appearing sick or
weak.”

“One signal that is used now by
Westerners to gauge the fitness of So-
viet leaders is the tendency to play up
the leader in the press in order to off-
set fears of ill health or incapacita-
tion,” hesaid.

‘“‘There has been a sudden prolifer-
ation of articles by and about Cher-
nenko in the press. Westerners have
tended to interpret this as an attempt
to convey that everything is all right
and that he’s still in the driver’s
seat.”

“This happened with Andropov, so
I think that’s a reason that it’s now
used by Kremlinologists,”’ he said.

McCaughrin said a second signal is
a building down the street from the
Kremlin, the Hall of Columns, where
leaders lie in state.

“Tf there’s a lot of activity there or
they’re putting up black bunting, you
can infer that something just happen-
ed,’’ he said.

Currently a chess tournament is
being held in the building. ‘‘That's
another way that I think they’re try-
ing to throw us off the track,’’ he
said.

‘Do you take the signals as count-
er-signals?”’ he asked. ‘‘The problem
is there’s no way to confirm these
signals.”

yn right away who will do well on
this,’ "’

According to the survey, arts and
science majors will.

“Whether that tells how good a
lawyer someone will be is irrelevant
tous,’’ Adelman said.

Delos D. Hughes, chairman of
Washington and Lee’s politics
department, said the results of the
survey were surprising. But, he said,
he did not anticipate that the politics
department would institute any logic
or reasoning courses to improve
students’ LSAT scores.

“This is not considered to be a
preparatory course for law school,”
Hughes said.

‘‘Regularly I tell students that this
is not a pre-law major,’’ Hughes add-
ed. ‘‘Typically law school admissions
people say that it doesn’t matter to
them what your major is.’’

 

 

Professor Craig McCaughrin

McCaughrin was critical of recent
press reports that Chernenko may
’ have voluntarily agreed to relinquish
his position to another. ‘‘No one
bothers to check the story,”’ he said.
“They figure one source is sufficient.
“It may be that the information is
not available anywhere else, but I
don’t think any effort has been made
to disprove the story.”’

In addition, he said he had “‘pro-
found problems’’ with press reports
that this would be the first time in
Soviet history that there has been a
voluntary transfer of power.

“First of all, we have no way to
know if it’s voluntary,” he said. “It
may be that this is a very subtle coup
d’etat. By one rumor, Chernenko is in
the intensive care unit in a local Mos-
cow hospital. It may be that Chernen-
kois not ina position tosay ‘no.’ ”’

“Second, even if that is true, it is
not really the first time such a trans-
fer of power has taken place,’’ he
said, adding that he has identified
two ‘‘quasi-voluntary” transfers in
Soviet history.

“What is more significant is that
this would be the first time that a
well-established leader was replaced
without a death in office,’ he said.

Patricia Walther, the W&L law
school’s assistant dean in charge of
admissions, said the LSAT is used to
determine a student’s qualifications
in conjunction with undergraduate
grade point average, extracurricular
activities and recommendations.

‘We don’t have any major re-
quirements,’’ Walther said. “I think
a lot of different majors are going to
be good background.”

The LSAT can show how good a stu-
dent is at approaching problems fac-
ed by lawyers, said Paul Richard of
the Law School Admissions Service.
Law schools then can use curricular
achievements to determine how good
a student he is.

“Our experience has shown that
philosophy and art and engineering
majors do just as well in law school
as politics or history majors,”
Richard said.

interested in students with business
majors, who initially compete better
than students who have earned
degrees in the liberal arts. Bredin at-
tributed this to the fact that senior
managers, who value people with a
liberal arts education, are not involv-
ed in the recruitment of new employ-
ees.
Even so, students should not reject

the liberal arts in the favor of more
pre-professional courses, Bredin
said.

“Students should take advantage
of their four years here to learn as
much about our world as possible —
learn about history, philosophies and
religions,’’ Bredin said.

Students with a broad liberal arts
foundation, combined with some
knowledge of accounting, marketing
and economics, will in the long run be
more successful than those who have
acquired a strictly technical educa-
tion, Bredin said.

“Liberal arts students have a bet-

 

Com:

ter sense of what is happening in the
world, they understand political and
economic trends, they have a sense
of the wholeness of the world,” he ad-
ded. “‘It’s a very subtle thing.’’

The most important part of a
resume is its visual impact, Bredin
said, because ‘‘you have to remem-
ber that employers are looking at
thousands of resumes.”

Students also are urged to send
their resumes out early, preferably
in the late fall of their senior year. As
Bredin said, ‘‘The early bird gets the
worm.”’

Dirty Secrets

 

 

Politics Professor Craig W. Mc-
Caughrin advises against lending too
much credence to the initial events
and analysis that would follow the
death or replacement of Soviet
leader Konstantin U. Chernenko.

‘‘My advice is not to pay attention
to anything when it comes out at
first,’’ he said this week. ‘‘It’s going
to be very difficult to tell what’s hap-
pening. There’s a lot of infighting and
struggling going on that we can’t see.
The first couple of weeks and months
are essentially protocol and are not
to be taken seriously.”

Chernenko currently holds three
positions: general secretary of the
Communist Party, chairman of the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
(president) and what McCaughrin
calls “generalismo of the defense
apparatus.”’

The professor said that means he
could be replaced by one, two or
three people. ‘‘The options are much
more open than most Westerners
think,” he said. ‘Initially what you
may find is three people.”

McCaughrin said the most interest-
ing question following Chernenko’s
«departure from office will be whether
he is succeeded by the much-touted
Mikhail Gorbachev, the 53-year-old
general secretary of the Communist
Party Central Committee.

“That would be unprecedented be-
cause of the age difference we’re
talking about here,” he said. ‘This
would be a really pronounced, cross-
generational change. Gorbachev is
from a whole different political
generation. He was not even a teen-
ager when World War II was taking
place.

“This would be the first time in
Soviet history that the top leadership
position would be held by someone
who has had no direct experience
with war as an adult. That's really
profound.”’

Another likely possibility to suc-
ceed Chernenko is 62-year-old Polit-
buro member Grigori Romanov, Mc-
Caughrin said, adding that Roma-
nov’s age gives him a possible edge
over Gorbachev. McCaughrin said
“longer shots’ include 71-year-old
Viktor Grishin and 80-year-old Niko-
lai Tikhonov.

“If it’s anyone outside of those, it
would be a surprise,’ he said. ‘I kind
of pooh-pooh playing the game of try-
ing to determine which of these indi-
viduals it’s going to be. They’re or-
ganization men, they all think alike
and they’re all from the same gener-
ation.”

He said two safe predictions are
that the leader will be a man, be-
cause women are allowed few leader-
ship roles in Soviet society, and that
the person will be a Russian, rather
than a Ukrainian or a Georgian, such
as Joseph Stalin.

McCaughrin said foreign minister
Andrei Gromyko is not in the running
to succeed Chernenko. ‘‘He had the
chance to assume power long ago and
did not,” he said. “‘It’s clear that he
sees himself as wanting to remain in
a state position rather than in a pri-
mary party position.”

McCaughrin said that no matter
who assumes Chernenko’s seat, ‘‘no
bold policy initiative will be under-
taken by a new leader.”

“The chance that the replacement
of one individual will affect policy
dramatically is very remote,’’ he
said, explaining that it takes some
time for the designee to consolidate a
regional power base.

By controlling the secretaries of
the regional parties, a position Mc-
Caughrin compared to that of a U.S.
governor, a Soviet leader can indi-
rectly control membership in the Po-
litburo, since the secretaries have in-
putin the selection of new members.

“Pay very careful attention not to
the top person but to the people who
are appointed to the lower-level lead-
ership positions in the first six mon-
ths,” he advised.

McCaughrin added that when he
suggests watching leadership moves,
he’s ‘‘not only talking about who’s go-
ing in, but also who’s going out.

“This is what Kremlinwatchers
and the CIA people do all the time,”
he said. “From watching these re-
cruitment changes, we can make
some inferences about who’s consoli-
dating power at the time.”

Scotching the Susann propaganda

Professor McCaughrin refers to
life within the Communist Party as
“a hermetically sealed existence’’
that individuals seldom break out of.

“The closest approximation to a
monastic order that exists in the
world today is membership in the
Communist Party,’’ he said. ‘It’s
like joining a religious cult like the
Moonies. That’s why no ruling leader
of the Communist Party has ever de-
fected.”’

“It is for that reason that I doubt
they are as cosmopolitan as they
have been alleged to be,” the profes-
sor commented. ‘‘I don’t think Cher-

nenko reads Jacqueline Susann no-
vels and drinks Scotch.”

He attributes many of the reports
of the supposedly Western attitudes
of Soviet leaders to disinformation.

“There is a division of labor within
the KGB concerned with disinforma-
tion,’’ he said. ‘‘It exists — there’s no °
doubt about it. The mission is to de-
liberately fabricate misinformation
to mislead the West.

“You feed Western reporters the
information you want them to have.
‘Disinformation’ is a neologism for
‘propoganda.’ It distributes a false
message to confuse and befuddle.”’

Biology Forum to publish journal

 

By JOHN RILEY
Staff Reporter

 

Three senior biology majors are
planning a new campus magazine
that they say will feature informed
comment in the fields of medicine,
bioethics, psychology and sociology.

The Journal of Science, which will
debut this spring, is the brainchild of
seniors Guy Caldwell, Jeff Blount
and John Long, all members of the
W&L Biology Forum,

“We think the time has come for
W&L to have an opinionated journal
dealing with current science issues,
whereas 30 years ago this might not
have been the case,’’ Caldwell said.

The three decided, Caldwell said,
that there were student resources in
the sciences that were not being tap-
ped. They then took their idea to the
Executive Committee this month and

were awarded $550 to produce the
magazine, with Caldwell, Blount and
Long serving as editors.

The Journal will have a format
similar to W&L’s Political Review. It
will be published twice a year and
consist of five or six articles, and 16
to 20 pages.

Some specific examples of topics
that might be included, Caldwell
said, are genetic engineering, Dar-
winism vs. Creationism, and the
Baby Fae case.

The magazine is soliciting manu-
scripts from students and faculty.
Papers should be about five pages
long, should be typed and should in-
clude footnotes if currently published
materials are included.

The Journal will not be overly
technical, Caldwell said. ‘‘We’re not
looking for the term projects of
science majors,”’ he said. ‘“The opin-

ions of an English major are just as
important to the magazine as those of
science majors.”’

Caldwell acknowledged that
sciences are overshadowed by other
subjects at W&L, but he did not see
this as a problem for the magazine.
‘More and more, the sciences are
overlapping with other fields,’ he
said. ‘‘Medicine, for example, is no
longer just a science but is a major
industry, and each new medical
breakthrough produces new legal
questions. I think we can expect con-
tributions from the entire campus.”’

Caldwell said he hopes to attract
attention to the sciences at W&L,
which he believes are greatly under-
rated. ‘‘Ninety percent of W&L
science majors who apply to medical
schools are accepted,’ he said.
‘‘We’re hoping that with a literary
arena to work from, we can get some
good publicity.’’

 

Phones

Many of these protests are coming in the form of
reduced gifts, such as a reduction from a $1,000 gift to a
$100 gift, McNeese said. Although there are some in-

reported that almost 95 percent of the people called

have made pledges.

There is, however, an issue on the minds of many
alumni that has had an effect on the giving. The deci-
sion for the University to go coeducational in the fall
has stirred some alumni into making what McNeese

called ‘‘little acts of protest.”’

stances of alumni eliminating their gifts because of

coeducation, ‘‘it is the exception,’’ McNeese said.

Last week, in four nights, the volunteer students ob-
tained 418 pledges for $52,080.

The money raised by the students will go into W&L’s
general budget to further the education process and
help lessen tuition increases.

Thus, according to McNeese, by participating in the

phone-a-thon, ‘“The students are helping themselves.’’

M.D. victim says

misdirected aid

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

 

Many people find it surprising that
not all handicapped people are pleas-
ed with projects of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association such as the
Jerry Lewis Telethon and_ this
weekend's Superdance.

One of the dissenters is Evan J.
Kemp Jr., a 1959 graduate who is ex-
ecutive director of the Disability
Rights Center in Washington. Kemp
was on campus last week when he
was initiated as an alumni member
of the national leadership fraternity
Omicron Delta Kappa.

At the ODK luncheon following the
tap ceremony, he said events such as
the Superdance are demeaning to
handicapped people because they
show them at their worst, as people
on their deathbeds.

“Most disabled people think the
Telethon should be done away with,”’
he said in an interview this week.
‘These Telethons depict the disabled
without asking the disabled.”

“Social do-gooders get their kicks
out of doing things for people, con-
trolling people,’’ he continued. ‘‘I
think the social do-gooders over 40
actually hate me.”’

The son of two founders of the
M.D.A., Kemp has been a victim of
Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, a
form of muscular dystrophy, for
most of his life and has spent most of
that time in a wheelchair.

The Disability Rights Center was
founded in 1976 by Ralph Nader.
Kemp, who lobbies for rules and
regulations favorable to the han-
dicapped, said he has spent 400 to 500
hours with President Ronald
Reagan's aides.

Kemp said he does not disapprove
of raising money to cure muscular
dystrophy. ‘I just think it can be
done ina positive way,”’ he said.

Lewis, Kemp said, is to disabled
people very much like Bull Connor is
to blacks.”’ He claimed that Lewis’

misinterpretation of the needs of the
disabled costs society $300 billion a
year in unutilized labor.

Since the inception of the M.D.A.
Telethon, the program has had about
35 poster children, Kemp said.

‘Now what has happened to
them?’’ Kemp asked. ‘‘Those people
use the children for three or four
years and then discard them. If
someone is honestly concerned with
taking care of people, then it’s hard
to take any of it seriously.”’

Kemp, who is writing a book he
plans to title ‘‘The Excluded Majori-
ty,” said that most American policy
is controlled by a group of 5-foot-10,
28-year-old white Anglo-Saxon males
in perfect mental and physical
health. He said, though, that much of
the American population-does not fit
that category.

Chris Williams, president of ODK
and chairman of the Superdance,
declined to have his committee meet
with Kemp while he was in Lexington
last week.

Williams said the committee had a
conflict with a previously planned
M.D.A. event.

“Chris’s not sitting down to talk to
me shows’’ people’s insensitivity to
the problem, Kemp said. “‘If Chris
was on a panel for nuclear disarma-
ment and I was for nuclear buildup, it
would seem he would want to share
ideas.”’

Kemp said he is trying to educate
people to another view and does not
intend to be ‘‘overly critical.”’

Williams said Kemp’s views will
not deter Superdance, “It gives us
more determination to make it a suc-
cess,’’ he said.

Kemp was ‘‘off on some state-
ments,” Williams said. He explained
that while Kemp’s efforts as a lob-
byist in Washington are admirable,
there are those who do not benefit
from such work. Williams said he
sees the Superdance as Washington
and Lee’s way of helping out.

Every year hundreds of students
from Washington and Lee and the
surrounding women’s colleges get
together to raise money to fight
muscular dystrophy. But how many
students really know what muscular
dystrophy is or how the Muscular
Dystrophy Association is fighting
these diseases?

A research update report by Dr.
Donald Wood sheds some light on
M.D.A.’s efforts to combat these
diseases.

M.D.A., founded in 1951, is con-
cerned with 40 neuromuscular
diseases, only some of which are
muscular dystrophies. Almost half of
these diseases were identified after
M.D.A. was formed.

The most severe form of muscular
dystrophy is Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, an inherited disease that
slowly destroys the body’s muscles.
Between the ages of three and five, a
child with Duchenne muscular dys-
trophy will begin to trip and fall and
have difficulty standing up. Victims
are usually confined to a wheelchair

Domino’s car

From Staff Reports

A late night delivery Saturday has
left Domino’s Pizza without one of its
“hot boxes,’ according to Police
Chief L.O. Sutton.

The police report said a delivery
was made to 4 Lee Ave. at about 2:15
a.m. After returning to the car, the
delivery person discovered that the
box had been stolen.

 

 

by age 12.

Because the disease continues to
weaken the back muscles, it becomes
more and more difficult for the pa-
tient to even sit up ina wheelchair.

‘The spine starts to twist and
collapse — the young patient takes on
a hunched-over position. Further
weakening can cause the spine to
twist, leading to a twisted, hunched-
over position known as the pretzel-
shape. As muscles in the hand
disintegrate, the fingers take on a
claw-like appearance and painful
contractures develop in hands and
feet alike,’’ Wood writes in the
report.

Although the life span of victims of
Duchenne dystrophy is increasing,

M.D.A. funds helped W. King Engel
discover that the hormone TRH could
provide ALS sufferers with tem-
porary relief from that disease that
destroys the spinal nerves.

M.D.A. is also financing genetic
research into diseases such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy in
order to identify the genetic protein
deficiency that causes the disease
and perhaps achieve a major
breakthrough toward a cure. This
genetic research is expensive. Wood
estimates that the cost of the genetic
research will require M.D.A. to raise
“virtually double what we've been
raising.”’

M.D.A. is almost the only organiza-
tion fighting neuromuscular diseases
in America today. No university or
medical school in the country has a
department dedicated to muscle
research.

“Every doctor in the United States
right now who has specialty training
in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up
care of patients with neuromuscular
diseases was trained under M.D.A.’s
clinical fellowship program,” Wood
reports.

‘Winging it’
with WLUR’s
Rock-a-thon

By ANTHONY CORNEALIUS
Staff Reporter

 

In conjunction with this weekend’s
Muscular Dystrophy Association Su-
perdance, Washington and Lee jun-
iors Cotton Puryear and Mike Stach-
ura will present a 30-hour request
Rock-a-thon on WLUR-FM. The
Rock-a-thon will begin tomorrow at 8
p.m. and run through Sunday at 2

a.m.

The two, described by Stachura as
“kinda ‘off’ guys,”’ will initiate their
attack by asking listeners to donate
one dollar each time they make a re-
quest.

Puryear, a three-year veteran ‘of
WLUR and photography editor of
The Ring-tum Phi, said this is the
second annual Rock-a-thon, which is
designed to ‘‘have a lot of fun raising
a lot of money.”

He said preparation for the gig will
be minimal. “It’s a wing-it week-
end,”’ he said.

Activities scheduled include live
remote broadcasts from the student
activities pavilion, guest appear-
ances by Puryear and Stachura at
the Superdance and various off-the-
wall antics over the air.

Both say they think they are offer-
ing ‘publicity and an an alternative
during non-Superdance time,’’ Pur-
year said.

“People are going to look for some-
thing else to do that weekend and we
figure they can party and listen to the
radio,” added Stachura, sports editor
of The Ring-tum Phi, who also has
been on WLUR since his freshman
year.

The two are hoping to get donations
from people who might not have been
approached from the Superdance
groups.

“Superdance is geared toward
W&L, VMI and the women’s colleges
and not toward the people of Lexing-
ton,’ Puryear said. ‘‘We’re hoping
they will be listening and donate.”

The origin of their musical on-
slaught was the Mockin-Rockin
weekend during the 1984 Mock Demo-
cratic Convention.

formation that he then passed on
to the special grand jury.

In a six-page response, Read
said the Pack motion, filed by
Lexington attorney Thomas C.
Spencer, was ‘‘a_ politically
motivated attack against the en-
tire drug investigation and
against me personally.”’

Both motions were included
with a report on Read’s conduct
that the local bar association sent
to the Virginia State Bar late last
year.

Judge Rudolph Bumgardner III
of Staunton appointed Nance on
Jan. 23. Read signed a statement
at the bottom of the motion that
said, “I ask for this.”’

Henrico County is part of the
Richmond suburbs.

Laughlin, who taught at the Wash-

1940 until his retirement in 1977, died
Tuesday in Lexington at the age of 77.

Laughlin specialized in teaching
evidence, labor law, administrative
law and jurisprudence. He was
known as an authority in labor ar-
bitration.

He graduated first in his law class
at George Washington University
and went on to obtain a master’s
degree in law from Harvard and the
J.S.D., the legal equivalent of a
Ph.D., from the University of
Chicago. He then practiced law and
taught political science before join-
ing the W&L faculty.

A 1982 publication of the University
Press of Virginia titled ‘Legal
Education in Virginia, 1779-1979”
contains a major contribution by
Laughlin.

Zone change A

for new dorm
recommended

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee passed the
first checkpoint on the road to the
construction of a new dormitory
Thursday, when the Lexington Plan-
ning Commission unanimously
recommended that City Council
establish a new institutional zone to
encompass the land owned by the two
universities.

Present city zoning regulations will
not permit the construction of a dor-
mitory on land owned by W&L. The
University’s other dormitories were
“‘grandfathered in’’ when the present
zoning regulations were established.

Acting on the recommendation of
City Manager John V. Doane, the
commission approved only the con-
cept of a new institutional zone. A
consultant will be hired to draw up
the specifications for the new zone.

The commission also approved
Doane’s proposal that the specifica-
tions for the new zone include provi-
sions allowing for ‘reasonable site
plan review”’ of changes made in the
property within 100 feet of streets and
other zones.

Before the new zone becomes legal,
City Council must hold public hear-
ings on the proposed change and ap-
prove the measure.

Fred Cox, an architect for the
University, told the planning com-
mission that it should be careful that
the site plan review provision does
not become a form of harassment.
Cox said minor changes should be
reviewed at the staff level, while ma-
jor changes could be reviewed care-
fully by the commission.

Although all of Virginia Military
Institute’s land would be included in
the new institutional zone, it would be
under no obligation to abide by the ci-
ty ordinances because it is a state in-
stitution, Cox added.

In the public hearing held before
the commission’s recommendation,
three Lexington residents expressed
concerns about the effect a new dor-
mitory near the corner of Washing-
ton and Nelson streets would have on
adjacent homes. The residents em-
phasized that their concerns should
not be interpreted as ‘‘opposition.”’

“I would like to express a degree of
moderate concern based on a lack of
information,’’ said David B. Dickens,
a W&L professor and a resident of the
neighborhood near the proposed dor-
mitory site.

“IT generally agree with the pro-
posal. But I’m very much concerned
with the specifics,”’ said Brig. Gen.
Tobias R. Philbin Jr.

W&L President John D. Wilson

 

From Staff Reports

 

A bill to raise the legal drinking
age in Virginia to 21 seems on its
way to approval by the Virginia
General Assembly, although the
House of Delegates added a minor
snag yesterday.

During debate on the bill, the
House, by a 51-43 vote, tacked on
an amendment stating that Vir-
ginia will raise the drinking age to
21 only if the federal goverment
raises the drinking age on milita-
ry bases to 21.

A similar amendment, recom-
mended by a Senate committee,
failed in the full Senate, which ap-
proved the drinking age increase
Tuesday by a 29-11 vote. Tues-
day’s action marked the first time*
the Senate had approved such a
bill.

The House gave preliminary
approval to the bill with the

 

replied that the University has not
yet asked the architects to draw up
precise plans because the University
could not be sure about obtaining the
land for the proposed dormitory site
and the legal right to construct a
dorm. Wilson added that the corner
of Nelson and Washington ‘‘is not one
of the most attractive”’ areas in town.

“We hope to build an attractive
facility,”’ Wilson said.

One of the specifics that concerned
Philbin is possible parking problems
in the area. Philbin asked that the
University provide one parking
space per student and that provisions
be made so that students would not
cause a traffic jam when loading or
unloading possessions.

Cox said the architects would try to
be sensitive to some of the com-
plaints raised by the residents. He
said that the dormitory could be con-
structed so that loading and
unloading would take place on the in-
side of the block and not on Nelson
Street.

Doane said that the city would
place limits on parking and traffic
when it drew up the specifications for
the new dormitory.

Dickens said he was concerned
about the precise location of the dor-
mitory. He said he hoped that the
Ackerly house, directly across
Nelson Street from his house, would
be preserved.

Frank Parsons, executive assis-
tant to Wilson, replied that the
University probably would build the
new dormitory ‘“‘down toward the ug-
ly corner.” But the Ackerly property
might be needed if a second phase of
development were required some-
time in the future, Parsons added.

‘We wouldn’t want to promise
preservation of the Ackerly house,”’
Parsons said.

However, Wilson added that if ad-
ditional expansion were needed in the
next century, the natural location for
more housing would be up Washing-
ton Street toward Gilliam Dormitory.
At present, there are two private pro-
perty owners on that land who are not
interested in selling their land to the
University, Wilson noted. But the
property owners’ reluctance to sell
might change in the distant future, he
added.

Anne Philbin, wife of Tobias
Philbin, said she was concerned
about how much blasting would be
required during the construction of a
new dormitory. She said blasting can
damage property in nearby homes.

Cox said he did not think a building
the size of the dormitory would need
such a deep foundation that it would
require a lot of blasting.

Legal drinking age of 21

voice vote yesterday, and a final
vote was scheduled today.

The bills in the two houses also

then to210n Oct. 1, 1986.

Similar bills have failed in past
years, but the General Assembly
this year is faced with a federal
government threat to reduce high-
way funding to states that have
not adopted a drinking age of 21 by
October 1986.

Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb
has said he would sign a bill rais-
ing the drinking age to 21.

Jerry Darrell, food services

age of 21 could seriously damage
business in the Cockpit and

“Whistleblower” A. Ernest Fitzgerald, University Librarian Maurice D.

of Fitzgerald’s papers donated to the library. One of Fitzgerald’s reasons for
donating the papers to W&L was the presence of Mollenhoff, who served as

‘Whistleblower’ gives
documents to library

A. Ernest Fitzgerald, who made
headlines during the 1970s as the
most famous contemporary ‘‘whis-
tleblower,’’ has donated his papers to
the University Library.

Fitzgerald was fired by the Air
Force in 1969 after citing cost over-
runs of about $2 billion on the C5A jet
transport plane being constructed by
Lockheed. At the time, it was written
that Fitzgerald’s sin was ‘‘commit-
ting truth before Congress.’’ He was
reinstated after a 15-year battle in
the courts and currently works as
management systems deputy in the
office of the secretary of the Air
Force.

The papers donated by Fitzgerald
to the library chronicle his long court
fight and include depositions of
former President Richard M. Nixon
and high officials of the last five ad-
ministrations. Other documents are
trial transcripts, related Congres-
sional hearings and other govern-

papers to Washington and Lee, in
part, because of his association with
W&L journalism Professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff. As ombudsman in the
Nixon White House, Mollenhoff was a
leading critic of the decision to fire
Fitzgerald and later covered the
Fitzgerald case for the Des Moines
Tribune.

“I became convinced that placing
these papers in the Washington and
Lee library would ensure their best
use,” Fitzgerald said. ‘I know that
Professor Mollenhoff continues to
take a great interest in this area and
am certain that he and his students
will make good use of them.

“In addition, I found that the
University Library is a very good
library for historical documents, but
these materials will not get lost in the
crush of thousands of miscellaneous
documents as might be the case in
some other libraries.”’

Will W&L women face chilly climate?

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

When the first female undergraduates enter
Washington and Lee next fall, the University will
face what two recent studies indicate will be a
major challenge of providing a campus and
classroom environment that is equally beneficial
to men and women.

The two studies, ‘‘The Classroom Climate: A
Chilly One for Women?” and ‘‘Out of the
Classroom: A Chilly Campus Climate for
Women?’’, describe various forms of discrimina-
tion women still encounter on college campuses
today. Both were prepared by the Project on the
Status and Education of Women.

Associate Dean of the College Pamela Simpson,
who chairs the Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that committee members have read the
reports and received information from the Pro-
ject on Women regarding other subjects.

“Basically, what’s in those documents is true,”’
Simpson said.

Some of the problems women encountered at
other schools will arise at W&L, and others will
not, Simpson added. She said the small size of
W&L should enable it to avoid some of the pro-
blems encountered by other universities.

W&L might also have an advantage over other
universities in addressing problems facing
women because W&L will be more willing to
change policies that are harmful to women, while

other schools may be set in theif ways; Simpson”

explained.
“We'll be more willing to question our assump-

» tions about women. We'll be teaching them for

the first time,’’ she added.

Bernice R. Sandler, executive director of the
Project on Women, said that W&L would face
some special problems in providing a beneficial
environment for women because it is just in-
tegrating.

The students at W&L now came to the school
expecting it to be all-male, Sandler said, and
might look at the women students as outsiders.

Sandler said that at a few all-male schools that

went coed, this resentment against the first
women spawned acts of overt hostility. A suppor-
tive and responsive attitude by the top ad-
ministrators toward the women students seems
to be crucial in limiting such hostility, she added.

Simpson said the Coeducation Steering Com-
mittee is addressing many of the problems that
could arise at W&L. But when a problem arises
that was not anticipated, the administration has
to be ready to respond and act on that problem,
she added.

Another problem Sandler anticipates arising in
the first few years of coeducation at W&L is that
some of the men may not be used to treating
women as equals and fellow students. They might
be thinking of the women solely as potential
dates, she explained.

“The world is changing, and men and women
are going to have to work together,’’ she said.
“It’s a disservice to both men and women if they
don’t learn to treat each other as equals.”’

Another problem could arise, Simpson said,
because in W&L’s first few coed classes, the
women as a group probably will be brighter than
the men because a smaller percentage of women
will be admitted. Some men may believe the no-
tion that bright women cannot be good-looking,
Simpson warned. Not only is this a myth, but at
most colleges with unbalanced ratios between
men and women, bright women do not have trou-
ble getting dates despite the existence of that
myth, she added.

In the ‘classroom, however, the Project on
Women studies indicate that a concerted effort is
needed to erase some of the disadvantages
women face. Faculty members may either in-
advertently or overtly treat men and women dif-
ferently in class, say Roberta M. Hall and
Sandler in their paper on the classroom environ-
ment.

‘*’..[T]hese patterns, by which women students
are either singled out or ignored because of their
sex, may leave women students feeling less confi-
dent than their male classmates about their
abilities. . .,’’ the report states.

‘“‘Both men and women faculty — even those

who are most concerned about sex discrimination
— may inadvertently communicate to their
students limiting preconceptions about ap-
propriate and expected behaviors, abilities,
career directions and personal goals which are
based on sex rather than on individual interest
and ability,” the paper’s authors argue.

Some of the ways professors inadvertently
discriminate against women in the classroom are
by doing such things as consistently asking
women simple, factual questions while reserving
the tougher theoretical questions for men and by
interrupting women more frequently than men,
the report states.

According to the authors, professors also tend
to make more eye contact with male students
than with female students and assume an atten-
tive posture when listening to a male student
while doing something such as staring at a clock
when a woman talks.

“A lot of this behavior is not deliberate and
mean,’ Sandler said. “‘It can be changedif~
become aware of it.’’

The report cites other, more obvious examples
of behavior that can have a negative effect on
women students such as the use of sexist humor
or demeaning sexual comments,

Male students also are harmed by discrim-
inatory treatment of female students, the authors
argue. Men’s stereotypical beliefs about women
are reinforced when a person of authority such as
a professor makes a comment demeaning
women, the authors say.

“This may make it more difficult for men to
perceive women students as full peers, to work
with them in collaborative learning situations,
and to offer informal support as colleagues...,”’
the authors comment in the report.

In the Project’s paper on the climate for women
outside the classroom, the authors report that
professors often direct women into fields of study
or majors that ‘‘are seen as ‘appropriate’ for
women.”

Professors should be careful that they give the
same kind of career advice to male and female
students of similar abilities, Simpson said.

EC studies library, exams, calendar

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

The 24-hour open library policy
was endorsed by the Executive Com-
mittee at its meeting Monday night.
The EC also approved a $100 donation
to the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion Superdance and discussed resub-
mitting the open exam proposal.

In an 11-0 vote, the committee ap-
proved the following motion: ‘‘The
EC supports the 24-hour open exam
policy.”

EC Vice President James White
said he thought the EC should let the
faculty library committee know it
was against closing the library from
la.m. to8a.m.

Senior representative Dave Jonson
suggested giving this weekend’s
Superdance $100.

“Should we hand out the student
tax like that?”’ asked White.

Following some discussion about
students’ giving money out of their
own pockets and fraternities’ making

donations, the EC voted 10-1 in favor

of the motion. Junior representative
Pat Hayden was opposed.

In other business, Jonson mention-
ed that he planned to reintroduce the
open exam policy to the faculty in
March. The proposal, which would
allow students to take exams without
scheduling them in advance, was
defeated by one vote in a faculty
meeting last year.

“It’s become a huge monster of a
thing, as it’s always been,”’ said Jon-
son, who explained that the proposal
will go to the faculty EC and the
Faculty Discussion Committee be-
fore a faculty vote is taken. Jonson
said he has talked to department
heads and other professors, many of
whom want to see a uniform exam
policy with some educational benefit.

“The logistics is not really a pro-
blem, according to the faculty,’’ Jon-
son said.

Jonson also mentioned that copies
of an alternative calendar were pass-
ed out at last week’s faculty EC

meeting and should be discussed
Monday. The calendar, composed of
five six-week units, was presented to
the ad hoc committee by psychology
Professor David G. Elmes and was
included in the committee’s report to
the faculty.

Junior representative Michael
Black reported that the Speidel,
Goodrich and Goggin fundraiser for
the United Way, proposed for Feb. 8
in the Cockpit, has been rescheduled
for March 14. The conflict came up

after the band announced it will be
recording an album in February.

The Hockey Club reported that it
expects a net loss for tne year of
$220.50. The EC agreed to cover the
entire amount with money from its
reserve fund.

The EC did not vote on the pronos-
ed voting regulations, but sophomore
representative Andrew Caruthers
noted that seven people already have
applied to serve on the Voting
Regulations Board.

W&L grapplers dominate College Invite

Three wins improve record to 9-2-1

 

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

 

 

The Washington and Lee wrestling
team easily retained its W&L College
Invitational title last Saturday, plac-
ing eight of 10 wrestlers in the finals
and emerging with five individual
champions.

The grapplers also raised their
recorc to 9-2-1 Wednesday evening
with victories over Newport News,
Virginia State and host Lynchburg.

The grapplers overwhelmed the
host Hornets, 51-6. They also topped
Newport News Apprentice by a 38-9
count and Virginia St., 30-18.

In the evening’s opening match,
Steve Castle at 118 lbs. squeezed out
an 11-10 victory over Lynchburg’s
Stuart Shelton. The Generals then
racked up four forfeit wins to take a
commanding 27 -0 early lead. Fresh-
man Mark Moore was stopped at 158

Jeff Dixon showed he was fully recovered from knee
surgery earlier this month in earning a 2-1 victory over

Ibs., but Win Phillips came back for
the Generals to post a fall at 167 to
maintain W&L’s 27-point margin at
33-6. Three more forfeit victories
ended the scoring at 51-6, just five
points short of the Generals highest
match point total ever.

Against Apprentice, the Generals
split the first two bouts with Castle
getting a forfeit win and Brian Lif-
sted losing by fall at 126 lbs. At 134
Ibs., Jeff Mazza won a 10-3 decision
and Larry Anker (142|bs.) took a ma-
jor decision with an 18-6 tally to put
the Generals up 14-6.

At 150 lbs., Kevin McNamara lost
by decision, but W&L fought back
with three wins in a row from Greg
Russell (158 Ibs.), Phillips and Joe
O'Neill (177 Ibs.), who recorded the
the Generals’ only fall of the match.
A pair of forfeit victories from cap-
tain Jeff Dixon (190 lbs.) and senior
heavyweight Mark Weaver closed
the scoring for the match.

The Ring-tum Phi

The Generals’ final match proved
to be the toughest, but W&L got a
strong performance from the middle
of its lineup to secure the team vic-
tory.

Castle started things off in fine
fashion for the Generals with a pin at
118, and Lifsted followed with a 9-7
win at 126 to give W&L the early
jump at9-0.

A loss by Mazza closed the Gener-
als’ margin to five, but wins from
Anker (142) and McNamara (150)
and a pin from Russell at 158 gave the
Generals a 22-4 advantage.

VSU made it close at the end, re-
cording a fall at 167 and a default win
at heavyweight, but a win from
O’Neill (177) and a tie from Dixon at

of women’s athletics, including
scheduling events, managing the
budget and recommending policy
and procedures relative to the opera-
tion of all women’s athletic activities.

Prior to her current position in
California, Rankin became familiar
with the W&L athletic department as
an assistant professor of physical
education at Dabney S. Lancaster
Community College in Clifton Forge
from June 1978 to September 1982.
During that time part of her respon-
sibilities included teaching
whitewater canoeing classes for
W&L students.

Ranking also chaired the depart-
ment of physical education and was
head women’s basketball coach at
Clifton Forge High School from
August 1974 to June 1978. In 1975 and
1976 her teams were runners-up in
the state tournament and _ she
directed the team to three District
championships. In 1976 and 1978 she
was selected ‘‘Coach of the Year’’ in
women’s basketball by the Virginia
High School League. Her three-year
coaching record at Clifton Forge was
41-4.

Before moving to Virginia, Rankin,
an Arcata native, directed the
physical education at El Cerrito High
School from August 1971 to June 1974.
At that time, she also served as
basketball, volleyball, tennis and
track coach.

Rankin, 36, is a 1970 graduate of
Humboldt State with a B.A. degree in
physical education and Spanish. She
also holds an M.A. degree in physical
education from Humboldt State.

The athletic department has de-
veloped a set of projections for the
formation of the women’s program,
but those projections remain uncer-
tain since much will depend upon the
patterns of interest shown by the
women who enter W&L in the fall.

Weaver. ‘‘We hope it’s nothing
severe,”’ assistant coach Rolf Pira-
nian said.

At Saturday’s College Invitational,
W&L easily outdistanced runners-up
Elon and Hampden-Sydney. The
Generals came away with top team
honors at 109 1/2 points to Elon’s 78
and the Tigers’ 48 1/2.

“I felt. the majority performed to
their potential (in the tournament),”’
said Coach Gary Franke, the win-
ningest wrestling coach in W&L his-
tory. While Franke termed the tour-
nament victory ‘‘a fine team effort,’’
it was the heavier weights that pro-
duced the biggest wins.

The Generals earned first-place
honors at heavyweight, 190, 177 and
167. Weaver used two pins to claim
the heavyweight title, while Dixon
earned a 2-1 victory over Hampden-
Sydney’s Allen Blow for the 190 title.
Blow defeated Dixon last year at the
Eastern Regional championships.

O’Neill got a stern test from his
own teammate, Greg Kendrick, at
177 before winning the championship.
Kendrick was competing on the Gen-
erals ‘‘A’’ Team, a group composed
of extra W&L wrestlers that event-
ually came away with sixth-place
honors in the seven-team meet.

Phillips got a couple of falls on his
way to the 167 title bout where he up-
set top-seeded Rhinehardt Grey of
Pfeiffer, 12-6.

The Generals also got a champion-
ship performance from Mazza, who
recorded a pin in the title match at
134 Ibs.

Finalists for W&L were Lifsted
(126), McNamara (150) and Russell
(158), who fell to the top seed. Castle
(118) and Anker (142) earned third-
place honors.

On Saturday, the Generals will
travel to the City of Brotherly Love
for the LaSalle Triangular. On tap for
W&L are bouts with the host Explor-
ers and the University of Scranton, a
team the Generals finished ahead of
in December’s W&L Invitational,
where the Generals finished third.

After the triangular on Saturday,
the Generals have a dual meet on
Feb. 9 against Longwood, and then
begin preparing for NCAA Eastern
Regionals at Trenton State (N.J.)
University Feb. 14-16.

 

 

...And what does this man know

January 31, 1985

 

By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

Last week one of the major
stories in Washington and Lee
sports was the return of senior
captain Jeff Dixon to the wrestl-
ing team. The headline read,
“Dixon Back,’’ but what was the
big deal?

The big deal was that on Jan. 3,
Dixon underwent arthroscopic
surgery on his right knee at home
in Oklahoma. On Jan. 21 he work-
ed out with the team and on Jan.
23 he was back in action wrestling
ina meet and winning.

Arthroscopic surgery is not a
new technique. It has been around
for more than 50 years and was
first used in Japan in 1934. But ar-
throscopic surgery is not like nor-
mal surgery, there is no ‘‘cutting
open” and it takes less time to
heal. Instead of using a scalpel the
doctor will use an arthroscope,
a pen-shaped instrument that
weighs about six ounces.

The arthroscope is hooked up to
a monitor.

The doctor then places the ar-
throscope into the patient’s knee
and views the internal part of the
knee on the screen. The surgery is
done by making five or six inci-
sions around the problem area
and watching the monitor. The ar-
throscope has ‘‘snippers’’ on the
end of it so that the doctor can cut
or remove any scar tissue or bone

fragments.
After the surgery, there is no
long scar — just small stab

wounds — and the patient needs to
stay in the hospital only one night.

In professional sports, arthro-
scopic surgery has become a nor-
mal practice. For example, Wal-
ter Payton of the Chicago Bears
had arthroscopic surgery during
the past season and played two
weeks later. Many doctors believe
that two weeks is pushing the
recovery time.

“T wait 10 days before going in
because a lot of surgery isn’t

...back on top again.

needed,’’ said Dr. Frank Mc-
Mains. ‘‘But most surgeons deal-
ing with college and professional
athletes will have the athlete un-
der the arthroscope in two days.”’

For Dixon it was different.

“He (the Doctor) wasn’t knife
happy at all. I had to talk him into
it; he wanted to wait,’’ Dixon said.

McMains explained that the gla-
mour of arthroscopic surgery lies
in its safety, its less expensive
cost and — as has been seen — its
faster recovery time. Most pa-
tients are young and in excellent
physical condition and dedicated
to training.

“T really didn’t lose strength,”
Dixon said. ‘‘But I did lose flexa-
bility because of swelling. I was
only on crutches for three days, I
was really amazed.”’

The question still remains, ‘‘Is
arthroscopic surgery done too
much and does it allow enough re-
covery time?”’

In an informal survey of 10 sur-
geons, six said ‘‘yes,’’ and four
said ‘‘no.”’ It’s a hard question to
answer, but certainly Jeff Dixon,
6-0-1 since he’s been back, and
Walter Payton, the NFL’s all-time
leading rusher, aren’t complain-
ing.

Examining the root
of academic problem

...Well, on to more inane com-

TIME _ mentary and restating the obvious,

but hey, I only hope I can become a

Gas... good idea again. This week some-

thing worthy of consideration comes

from our stately neighbors in

Maryland. Seems Prince George’s

County has set down a rule where

high school student-athletes
must maintain a C average or lose athletic eligibility.

Applause, applause. Yet some coaches and players are griping.
“‘T’m nervous. I’m real nervous about seeing those report cards,” said
one boys’ hoops coach. “I’m going to have some who are real close,”
he continues. ‘‘Running for a championship like I am, we could end up
going down the tubes.”’ Like I am, coach? But then, I guess only a
misguided high school coach could have ‘‘I’’ and “We’”’ refer to the
same thing in the same sentence.

Point is, for too long high schools have become athlete manufac-
turers for the colleges rather than people producers. A silly distinc-
tion, yet one that has to be viewed realistically. The typical scenario
goes like this: Joe All-World Prep slides through high school with
bloated ideas of superstardom and no concept of algebra and history,
not to mention your occasional functional illiterate. If Joe’s college of
choice has some entrance requirements, like whether you can tell the
difference between your headline in the sports pages and somebody
else’s headline, then Joe goes to junior college where eventually, if
he’s good enough (that’s court-wise and perhaps a little bit academic-
wise), he’ll go on to the big-time and play for somebody equally
academically sound, say Georgetown. As the story goes, well, you
know what they say, the mind is a terrible thing to waste, that is,
unless he can fill it up from outside.

The root of the problem lies in high school. PG’s idea is long over-
due, If young people are force-fed the idea that basketball and football
are only and ultimately going to take you as far as hopscotch, perhaps
there is hope that we can do away with such inane — this is almost as
inane as I am, but not quite — ideas as the 700rule. The problem
is not that college athletes aren’t capable of also being students. It’s
just that they were never asked to be anything more than cagers or
gridders in high school, and hence they don’t want to do any more in
college, and usually they don’t have to.

It is asad commentary on the people entrusted with young people —
like coaches are — when they become upset about academic
guidelines. But the result is even more lamentable. Let us hope that
while we’re forcing the kids to get an education, some of the misguided
and glory-seeking high school coaches learn a thing or two....

...On the Colonnade for some more inane commentary, barring any
more inexplicable ODAC episodes, the General cagers should battle
for second place in the conference next Saturday in Roanoke. (Em-
phasis on first part of sentence.) Not a must win, but would be nice,
heading into the rapidly approaching conference tournament... Tip of
the cap to the General grapplers on their championship performance
Saturday. They also got a fine showing of their depth with the
mysterious ‘‘A Team.” And while we're on the topic, let’s give
Heavyweight Mark Weaver the Herculean Task of the Month Award
for winning not only his weight class but defeating a couple of
behemoths whose combined weight was comparable to a herd of
bison....Early warning note: Lacrosse will start off season with Duke,
UNC, Maryland and U.Va....

.,. remember making some inane comment a couple of weeks back
about Georgetown possibly losing a few conference games, but then I
was just naturally making a fool of myself.....More on (or is it moron)
college hoops: don’t know what the problem is with Bob Knight at In-
diana, benching Steve Alford and leaving a couple of seniors home in
Indiana for Sunday’s loss at Illinois. I’ve heard of shaking up the
lineup, but I think Bob’s overstepped the bounds of logic this time.
Some say he’s starting to crack (as in “‘up’’)....1 wonder...Maryland
will play 41 games by tournament time....and look it..

ee Finally, Marvin Hagler says ‘‘It’s still the love of the game”’ that
keeps him boxing. Yeah, right. At $5.1 million a pop, I might learn to
love self-mutilation, too.....

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team snatched victory from the
jaws of defeat against Emory and
Henry and crushed traditional rival
Hampden-Sydney in winning two Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
games last week, both at the Warner
Center.

The victories improved the Gener-
als’ record to 11-7 (5-3 in the ODAC)
and moved W&L into a second-place
tie with Roanoke in the conference
standings.

Senior Scott Shannon connected on
a 15-foot turnaround jump shot on the
baseline with only :06 left on the
clock to give the Generals a come-
from-behind 58-56 victory against the
E&H Wasps Thursday night.

Lex Fitzenhagen was the high scor-
er for the Generals with 16 points;
Shannon led the squad i in rebounding
with seven.

The Generals held E&H, the sixth
highest NCAA Division III scoring
team in the nation and the ODAC’s
highest scoring seam at nearly 84
tallies an outing, to only 56 points.
The Generals did not stop the Wasps’
team leader Kevin Brown, who scor-
ed 19 points (7-8 from the floor and 5-5
at the line). Brown is the nation’s
fourth leading scorer and on top of
the ODAC individual scoring with a
points per game average of 26.1.

Neither team was able to build a
substantial lead in the first half.
Although E&H led 26-21 with six-and-
a-half minutes to go before intermis-
sion, the Generals managed to cut
the lead to one point at halftime,
30-29.

W&L opened the second half by out-
scoring the Wasps 6-0 and taking a
35-30 lead. The Generals maintained
a 43-39 lead with 13:30 left in the
game when Shannon hit two free
throws after a technical foul was
whistled on the E&H bench.

Perhaps inspired by the technical,
E&H, led by Brown, made a run at
the Generals midway through the
period and held a 51-48 lead when
Brown scored a basket with 7:35 re-
maining. E&H led 56-52 with less than
3 1/2 minutes to play, but would not
score againinthe game.

The Generals’ pressing defense led toa couple of easy
baskets in the second half of W&L’s 71-52 victory over
Hampden-Sydney. Here Mike Hudson (10), Kevin Me-

The Generals quickly cut into the
lead. Mike Hudson, senior guard, hit
one free throw to cut the lead to 56-53.
Fred Bissinger’s 10-foot jumper in
the lane after a steal brought W&L
within a point. Another steal by Gen-
eral sophomore forward Jeff Harral-
son led to a breakaway foul that sent
Fitzenhagen to the charity stripe for
two shots. He hit one of two to knot
the game at 56.

The Wasps had the ball. and a
chance to take the lead with less than
two minutes to play when Brown
missed his first shot of the game at
the 1:57 mark. The Generals controll-
ed the rebound and the ball for the
next 1:51 leading up to Shannon’s
winning basket.

Head coach Verne Canfield said
that he had not called a play that
required the 6-5 senior captain to
take the last shot.

“T do not like to set the final shot

for any player. It’s too much pres-
sure,’’ he said.

The Generals’ mentor cited the
play of Fitzenhagen, Hudson, Bis-
singer and Harralson as contributing
to the victory.

Canfield’s team gave their coach a
team performance in reversing a late
November 91-76 loss to Hampden-
Sydney on Monday night when the
Generals defeated the Tigers, 71-52.

“After the first game, we wanted to
show them that we are a team with
identity and chemistry,’’ Canfield
said

The Generals displayed their
chemistry when they jumped to a
quick 8-0 lead in the opening stages of
the game. With 14:51 remaining in
the first half, Harralson made an ex-
cellent feed under the basket to Har-
men Harden, who scored to push the
Generals’ margin to 10 points at 12-2.
The Tigers played the Generals even

for the remainder of the half, event-
ually cutting the deficit to seven at:
30-23 when the first half buzzer
sounded.

The Generals opened the anna
half in much the same fashion as they
did at the beginning of the game by
racing to an 18-7 second-half spurt
that put them in front, 48-30. Thé
Tigers never made a serious run at
the Generals’ large lead.

The Generals built their lead and
held it throughout the second stanza
by capitalizing on numerous H-SC
turnovers and defensive steals. W&L
scored 13 times on 18 possessions
following defensive steals for a 72
percent steal conversion rate.

Leading scorers for the Generals
were Fitzenhagen, for the second
time in as many outings, who had 17
points, and Shannon, who contributed
16 points toward the winning effort.

Looking back on the meet, the
Generals (5-1) are not upset with
their performance, but rather are
pleased.

“I was happy with the way we
swam. We worked toward some goals
all week in practice and we came up
with our share of first-place finishes
(five) against a very good Division I
team,” said W&L aquatics coach
Page Remillard.

Remillard was especially pleased
with the performances of senior Bob-
by Pearson and freshmen Simon
Perez and Eric Sullivan.

Pearson finished third in the 200-
yard freestyle (1:44.01), second in
the 100-yard-freestyle (48.74) and
was a member of the winning 400-
yard freestyle relay (3:17.71). Pear-
son’s time might have been even bet-
ter if it hadn’t been for the flu that he
caught during the week.

“T was suprised with how well I
swam. By Friday I was really drag-
ging,’’ said Pearson.

Coach Remillard referred to Pear-
son’s performance as ‘“‘real gutsy.”
But it wasn’t just Pearson who was
“‘gutsy,’’ the whole team was. The
divers for example, had to drive to
James Madison early in the day to
compete and finish in second in the
one-meter and had a second and
third-place finish in the three meter.

Then there was the 400-yard free
relay team. They had upset John
Hopkins earlier in the season and
were once again underdogs against
James Madison. But last week Tim
Stanford said they ‘‘were not going to
roll over and die.”’

Indeed, they didn’t. They won in-
stead.

For a spectator, which there were
quite a few because of the I.M. swim-
ming meet, one of the most exciting
moments was the 1,000-yard free-
style. It was shocking to see James
Madison's three men line up opposed
by Washington and Lee’s one man
—Eric Sullivan.

“I knew Eric would do well, so I
decided to send him alone so that his
performance would be noticed and to
get the crowd into the meet. He didn’t
only win — he beat them,” said
Remillard.

Sullivan won the 1,000-yard free-
style in 10:14.31 and the 500-yard
freestyle in 4:56.18.

“The team looks great, everyone
did what they were supposed to do,”
Stanford said. ‘“‘The loss doesn’t af-
fect the team. We’re psyched about
how well we did. James Madison is
behind us and now we have Gettys-
burg.”’

Gettysburg is a Division III team
that Pearson feels they should beat.
But they are viewing the meet in the
same way they did in preparing for
Frostburg and Georgetown dual
meets two weeks ago.

“It’s a lot like the Frostburg meet,
we should win but we can’t afford to
make the same mistake, we need a
full effort,’’ Pearson said.

MUSICNOTES

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

 

Hats off to the Student Activities
Board for two successful major rock
and roll presentations within a week
— here’s hoping the trend continues.
Ramones’ fans no doubt enjoyed the
show, but the majority of the au-
dience must have been scratching
their heads and wondering what
makes them so good. The sound was
terrible, and can only partly be blam-
ed on the poor acoustics of the W&L
aircraft hangar; the Strangers’
sound man gave them a loud and
clean sound. Judging by the high
standards set by Too Tough To Die,
the Ramones’ latest studio effort, I
expected more concern for the live
sound.

I also thoroughly enjoyed a Cockpit
happy hour band earlier Friday, the
Thrashers, who played a diverse, in-
teresting and enthusiastic set of
covers for an indifferent crowd. By
the way, they didn’t wear leather
bikinis or brandish whips — just
good, solid rock and roll chops.

 

The Ramones played last weekend at the Student Activities Pavilion.

Ramones highlight music scene

Shortcuts: Here’s what's happen-
ing at WLUR-FM:

Along with the major-label and
major-play releases such as John
Fogerty’s Centerfield, Don Henley’s
Building the Perfect Beast, and the
Frankie Goes to Hollywood ...Pleas-
uredome opus, many lesser-known
talents have recent and noteworthy
releases. The Bluebells’ Sisters is a
refreshing breeze of new British
rock, with strong melodies, har-
monies and a strong early-60s Brit-
invasion feel. One cut was produced
by Elvis Costello. Everything but the
Girl is both a band and an LP, witha
sound ranging from cocktail jazz to
acoustic folk. The emphasis is on the
vocals, with suitably spare in-
strumentation. Danny Elfman,
former lead singer of L.A.’s Oingo
Boingo, has an album of dance-
mixed, metallic rock balanced by his
strong voice, called So Lo.

The newest entry into the “big”
sound sweepstakes is an internation-
ally-composed group, A Drop in The
Gray. Certain Sculptures is interesting
when its Roxy-sounding cuts build up
a head of steam, although the album

lunacy called, appropriately, Border-
town, destined for hip dance parties
everywhere. Also from Texas is
Creatures From the Black Saloon, from
the Austin Lounge Lizards, a thor-
oughly hilarious and demented poke
at country music cliches. More
serious is Naked Prey, a gritty, hard-
edged American rock and roll LP
from the group of the same name.

Finally, my favorite movie sound-
track is Mark Knopfler’s beautiful
Music from the Film Cal, a successful
blending of new and old Celtic music
and instrumentation, demonstrating
Knopfler’s virtuousity. Billy Bragg
has had an EP out for a while called
Life’s a Riot with Spy vs. Spy, which
has him singing with only electric
guitar accompaniment. This import
shows Bragg’s streetcorner insight
and grit, and the songs stick after a
couple of listenings. For all you hard-
core fans, or anyone even vaguely in-
terested, check out any of these three
(the scum off the top): White Flag’s
Third Strike (west), The F.U.’s Do We
Really Want to Hurt You (east) and
the new Husker Du, New Day Rising
(midwest).

Oh yeah — one listen to Too Tough
To Die will prove that the Ramones
have still got what it takes to give
grease and leather a good name.

‘Cotton Club’: Talent survives story

MOVIEREVIEW

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

 

Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘“‘The Cot-
ton Club” is movie-making at its
best. Yes, the film cost megabucks to
make, and yes, the story appears
fragmented in parts, but the talent
used, the atmosphere created, and
the story, flawed though it may be,
prove that these dollars were well
spent.

Everyone in ‘‘The Cotton Club” is
out to become a success in the mob-
controlled Harlem of the 1920s and
1930s. A showcase for black talent
during those years (though its
clientele was strictly whites), the
Cotton Club serves as the backdrop
for much of the story, which revolves
around two sets of brothers and
centers on characters portrayed by

Richard Gere, Gregory Hines and
Diane Lane. Hines and Gere both
seem to be innocents caught in water
over their heads, each losing touch
with his brother unwittingly in rising
to the top. Lane, meanwhile, seems
to lose (and later find) herself as she
hopes to gain status in entertainment
circles. The performances of these
three actors are extraordinary. Gere
seems to improve with every role he
gets; Lane is feisty, sexy and far
from the stereotyped gun mall of
earlier ‘gangland’ pictures; and
Hines is simply incredible, dancing
and chasing his girlfriend, a light-
skinned mulatto woman who is torn
between her love for Hines and her
ability to use her skin color to ad-
vance ina segregated society.

Director Coppola also excels in
“The Cotton Club.’’ Though he has a
mob background to this picture, and
indeed the mob presence is impor-
tant throughout the movie, Coppola
(who directed both Godfather pic-

tures) doesn’t let that presence over-
whelm the other elements of this

complex story. Instead, he keeps 7.

those ‘“‘silent partners’ in proper
perspective, influencing and prying,
but definitely in the background. His
Harlem is realistic, alive and in-
spired, and his handling of the pro-
duction segments is as polished as
the productions themselves. Most
memorable is the sequence with
Hines dancing a capella tap while we
watch a mob hit-squad at work. The
contrast and comparison of the two
simultaneous acts captured on film
are bracing.

“The Cotton Club” certainly is one
of the best pictures of the last year.
Don’t let stories about the com-
plicated plot scare you away. Fans of
this particular era in entertainment
should see this picture for the music
and dancing alone. There is enough
in this film to satisfy almost any ap-
petite. In short, ‘The Cotton Club”’ is
not to be missed.

‘Dune’: visually stunning, flawed

MOVIEREVIEW

The realm of science-fiction is one
entered into by many novelists; few,
however, create a story as engulfing
as Frank Herbert’s ‘‘Dune.’’ Direc-
tor David Lynch’s screen adaptation
of this landmark book is currently
playing at the State Theater in Lex-
ington, and though it is unable to
grasp and present all of Herbert’s
masterpieces, it is still one of the
most visually and conceptually stun-
ning films to come out in quite a
while.

The story is difficult to encap-
sulate, and this is perhaps the major
flaw in Lynch’s adaptation. The basic
story, though, revolves around Spice,
a substatice that expands conscious-
ness, considered vital to the Galactic
Empire. It is found on only one

Winter play
opens Feb.8

“Of Mice and Men,’’ John
Steinbeck’s story of two drifters in
the early 1930s, will be performed in
the University Theatre from Feb.
8-12. Curtain time each day will be 8
p.m.

The play is being directed by Brian
O’Riordan, a drama major who is do-
ing the project for his senior thesis.

The story centers on two Califor-
nians, George and Lenny. Lenny is
innocent, childlike and possibly
retarded, while George is his well-
traveled and wise guardian. To-
gether they hope to save enough
money to buy a ranch or piece of land
on which to settle.

The script was adapted by the
author in 1937 for the Broadway pro-
duction of the play. O’Riordan said
he believes the story is one of
Steinbeck’s best, along with ‘‘The
Grapes of Wrath” and “East of
Eden,” and describes it as ‘‘Stein-
beck’s non-political indictment of
humanity.”

In the University Theatre’s produc-
tion, George will be played by Phil
Brown, a third-year law student, and
Lenny will be played by Chuck

’ Richards, a second-year law student.

Both have participated in previous
University productions — Richards
in last year’s ‘Cat On A Hot Tin
Roof” and Brown in “Love Poems.”

Props, sets and lighting are being
done by the Drama 132 class, ‘‘Fun-
damentals of Theater Art.’’ Tech-
nical rehearsals, in which the actual
sets and lighting will be integrated
with the actors begin Monday.

planet, Arrakis, nicknamed Dune.
This is the setting for a feud between
two rival clans, the Harkonnen and
the Atreides, a feud set up by the
emperor himself. What the emporer
had not planned on was the existence
of young Paul Atreides (Kyle
MacLachlan), who, it turns out, is a
messiah for the desert people of
Dune, who join in the fight against
the Harkonnen. There just seems to
be too much to keep track of here if
one is unfamiliar with the book.

The strength of ‘‘Dune,’’ though,
lies its presentation. Director Lynch
creates a galaxy unique unto itself.
The weaponry, the defenses, the bat-
tle sequences and the Spice se-
quences are all stunning to the eye.
There are no holds barred. Lynch
does carry the visuals too far at least
once too often: Repulsive is the only
word that can describe the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth Mc-

Millan), his facial lesions and his sex-
ual habits; one loses his brilliant tac-
tical side so prevalent in the book.
Some may even find his sequences
hard to stomach.

Bringing ‘‘Dune’’ to the screen was
an immense task. So much is covered
so quickly, and so much is not
covered at all (enough to upset some
‘“Dune’”’ purists) that this may be one
instance when a TV miniseries adap-
tation would have been able to cover
the material more fully and satisfac-
torily than a movie adaptation. Look-
ing at this film’s strongest points, the
visuals sweeping across the screen,
however, helps one realize that
“Dune” was meant for the large
screen. Unfortunately, its vast story
line complicates its presentation
enough that “Dune’’ may prove a
wasteland for those not initiated with
the original work.

Dain Dulaney, chairman of the
SAB Fancy Dress committee, said
this year’s schedule will be similar to
those of the past. A big-name rock
band will appear at the Student Acti-
vities Pavilion on Thursday, March
7. Although the SAB has not released
the identity of this band, Dulaney
said the band is comparable in stat-
ure and recognition to George Thoro-
good and the Deleware Destroyers,
7 played in the pavilion last week-
end.

Friday evening, March 8, is the
78th Fancy Dress Ball in the Warner
Center. The theme of the ball also is
being kept under wraps until the
week preceding the event. As usual, a
big band orchestra will provide
dance music in the Warner Center
and two rock bands will play in the
old gymnasium.

One change in this year’s ball, Du-
laney noted, is that the upper-level
classrooms in the Warner Center will
not be used. These are being prepar-
ed for women’s coaches’ offices for
next year.

Dulaney estimated that his budget
will be slightly more than last year’s
total, probably about $65,000.
