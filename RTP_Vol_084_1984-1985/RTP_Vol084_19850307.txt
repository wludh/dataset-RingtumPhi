Girard is arrested
on cocaine charge

From Staff Reports

 

Senior Gene Girard was arrested
Friday afternoon on charges of pos-
session of cocaine with intent to
distribute it, authorities said.

Sergeant R.W. Hall of the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff's Department
said Girard was arrested at the East
Lexington grocery store with one
ounce of cocaine that had been sent
from Miami via Federal Express, the
overnight package delivery service.

Girard was co-captain of the Wash-
ington and Lee football team last fall,
and was the squad’s leading rusher
for the last two seasons. As a junior,
he was an all-conference running
back.

Girard said he plans to plead not
guilty. “I don’t even know what
they’re charging me with, really,” he
said. ‘‘What they have is not right.”’

He said his attorney, Lexington
lawyer Larry Mann, had advised him
not tocomment further. Mann declin-
ed comment on the case.

A preliminary hearing has been set
for April 19. The charge carries a
possible sentence of five to 40 years

 

 

Cadet testimony banned from drug trial

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

The classmates of a former
Virginia Military Institute cadet will
not be allowed to testify at his drug-
dealing trial, a Circuit Court judge
ruled Tuesday.

An attorney-client relationship
that existed between Common-
wealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘‘John”’
Read and the cadet, Jeffrey R. Pack,
tainted evidence in the case, Judge
Rudolph Bumgardner III said.

Pack, 25, was indicted Sept. 4 on six
counts of selling psilocybin, the
hallucinogen known as ‘mush-
rooms.’’ He was realeased on a
$20,000 property bond. He left VMI
without graduating and now lives in
Springfield.

Four Tops

From Staff Reports

 

 

While Washington and Lee
students make final preparations this
week for Fancy Dress, their tuxedo
rentals, corsage purchases and din-
ner reservations are a great source
of income to Lexington and the sur-
rounding areas.

Many Lexington merchants inter-
viewed this week agree that Fancy
Dress is one of the biggest — if not
the biggest — weekends for business.

“Fancy Dress is our busiest time of
the year,” said Mary Brads, mana-
ger of the Stop In Food Store Inc. in
Lexington,

Traditionally, stores that rent or
sell tuxedos are especially busy in
the weeks preceding Fancy Dress.

“It is our busiest week of the
year,’’ said Townsend Fox, owner of
University Cleaners.

“This is big. It’s one of the biggest
weeks of the year,” said Alvin
Carter, owner of Alvin-Dennis.
“‘We’re real busy right now, so it’s
still growing.”

The College Town Shop will rent
about as many tuxedos this year as it

Special prosecutor H. Albert Nance
Jr. informed the court last week that
he intends to prosecute only two of
the counts at this time, and said he
would request that those charges be
reduced from sale to possession of
psilocybin. He said after the hearing
that the ruling does not apply to-the
other counts, which can be tried
later.

Nance last month requested su-
poenas for 10 present and former
VMI cadets. The jury trial was set for
Friday but now has been postponed
so both sides can review the judge’s
ruling.

Nance, Henrico County Common-
wealth’s Attorney, was named
special prosecutor in the case
because it was expected that Read
would be a witness at the pretrial
hearing.

Read was not called to testify,
although Pack’s attorneys had re-
quested a summons for him and
Nance was expected to call him.

“I’m extremely upset and disap-
pointed,’’ said Read, who was in the
courtroom before and after the hear-
ing. “I was prepared to take the
stand.”

At one point, Nance called ‘John
Beverly Read,’ but immediately
changed and instead called former
special grand jury foreman Samuel
H. Blackburn.

“T thought I could shorten it to
some degree by calling Mr. Black-
burn,’ Nance said later. ‘‘His
testimony was right to the heart of
the motion: ‘Everything we knew
about Pack we got from somewhere
else.’ ”’

“Mr. Read is not going to take the

stand and I think you can draw an un-
favorable inference from that,”
defense attorney Albert J. Ahern Jr.
told the judge.

Pack testified that he met with
Read in October 1983 after being ac-
cused of an honor violation at VMI.
Pack said Read offered to defend him
for a retainer fee of $2,500.

“IT could probably get you off on
this,’’ Pack quoted Read as saying.
By mutual agreement, Pack later
sought other counsel.

He testified that in the meeting
with Read he had confessed that he
“had used marijuana and mush-
rooms,”’ but that he was no longer us-
ing the drugs. He said Read then ask-
ed him a wide range of questions
about the use of narcotics at VMI.

“J told him I wasn’t there to

in jail and a fine of as much as
$25,000.

Girard was held in Rockbridge
County Jail for five hours until a
$30,000 property bond could be ar-
ranged with a Lexington bondsman,

Under the terms of the bail,
Girard, who is from Coral Gables,
Fla. may not leave Virginia without
court permission,

The sheriff’s department made the
arrest acting on a tip received by the
Lexington Police Department, Hall
said. Lexington Police Sergeant E.
Wayne Straub accompanied Hall on
the arrest.

“We received information from an
informant that this package was
coming through,” Hall said. ‘“‘Two
drug dogs alerted on the package. To
us there was no doubt in our mind co-
caine was in that package.”

He said the cocaine appeared to be
uncut, and would therefore be worth
about $6,000. ‘‘It stuck tightly like it
was pretty pure,” he said. He said
that if it had been cut — mixed with
other substances — it would be worth
about $3,000.

The seized substance has been sent
toa laboratory for testing.

Hall said the package was address-
ed to a fictitious name — ‘‘William
Babe Ruth” — at Girard’s Lexington
address. He said Girard had arrang-
ed to pick up the package at East
Lexington market.

Hall said the package bore a ficti-
tious Miami return address. He said
the name on the return address was
“officer something.”

He declined to say whether ‘he ‘n
formant was in Lexington or Miami,

Girard said he was dropped off at
the store by another student but was
by himself at the time of the arrest.

Additional charges may be filed in
the case either in Lexington or
Miami, but likely not against Girard,
according to Hall. He said the Feder-
al Bureau of Investigation is ex-
pected to investigate the Miami
aspect of the case.

Hall said that in the past other
Washington and Lee students have
used Federal Express to receive con-

did last year, according to Martha
Derrick, owner. The store had rented
20 on Monday alone by 1 p.m. and
probably will have about 200 rentals
for Fancy Dress. Carter and Fox de-
clined to say how many tuxedos they
would rent for the weekend.

Although the date of Fancy Dress
has been known since the fall, a few
students will always wait until the
last minute to make plans, mer-
chants said, but they usually can be
accommodated.

‘‘We do have people who straggle
in and are desperate for tuxedos,”’
said University Cleaner’s Fox. ‘I’ve
rented mine out.”’

Derrick said she sometimes runs
into a different problem at College
Town Shop.

“Lots of times,” she said, ‘‘the in-
experienced people have some wild
notion that [the tuxedo’s] going to be
sewn up for them,” because they
are measured so precisely and their

Phi Psi freshman David Weaver describes the box

“You initially dive for cover. Your box is your fox-

OPINION

Page 2
March 7, 1985

 

Vote:

Every one counts

This Monday, every student has a very important privilege
and right to exercise. It is called voting.

Perhaps we are tired of hearing how important it is to vote.
After all, does ‘‘my’’ vote really count? Of course it does, and
this year, it is especially important to remember that voting

is of the essence.

Last year, a referendum calling for the addition of a third
Law School representative failed because less than 50 per-
cent of the student body voted. According to the Student Body
Constitution, a three-day period is required for students to
vote on proposed changes. Next Monday, Tuesday and Wed-
nesday, we ought to vote for the additional representative.

An additional law student would add expertise in open
trials, improve representation of the Law School and begin to
break down that invisible yet very present ‘Woods Creek’’
barrier between the two campuses. More importantly, an
additional representative would help to revive the impor-
tance of the Honor System at the Law School. In the past, the
issue of an additional law rep has been misrepresented as a
question of equal representation. Instead, we must see the
question as not one of the representation but as one of making
the Honor System a viable force on both campuses. Everyone
—undergraduate and law student alike — would benefit from
an expansion of the committee to 13 members.

Next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday gives the student
body a unique opportunity — an opportunity to change its
constitution for the better. Past attempts at constitutional
change have failed because of the 50 percent requirement.
But because the Big Three elections will attract voters,
meeting that minimum should be significantly less difficult

next week.

It is unfortunate, therefore, that no one took the initiative to
propose additional constitutional changes for next week’s
ballot. The student body constitution desperately needs
cleaning up, and next week would have been an opportune

time to doso.

The second, though equally important, issue both campus-
es face is the election of Big Three officers for next year’s Ex-
ecutive Committee. As evidenced by the proliferation of
posters about campus and the sudden interest many upper-
classmen take in the well-being of their peers (ever hear of a
beer party for the opening of tennis season before?), we are
indeed in the midst of a ‘‘Big Three’’ election for the top posi-
tions on the Executive Committee.

Last week, we noted a lack of initiative on this year’s com-
mittee and expressed the hope that for the remainder of this
school year, as well as in future years, greater attention
would be given to the serious issues and responsibilities the

EC does face.

The student body now has the opportunity to show

that it

does not suifer from similar lack of initiative. By voting and
voting intelligently next week, we can alter the numerical
makeup of the EC for the better. Be judging each candidate’s
experience and potential for continued leadership, we can en-
sure a responsible, effective Executive Committee.

Third law rep urged

To the Editors:

I would urge you all to support the
upcoming referendum concerning a
constitutional amendment that pro-
vides for the addition of another law
representative to the Executive Com-
mittee. This representative would
serve dual objectives. Obviously, the
person would represent second-year
law student interests in administra-
tive matters. More importantly,
though the additional representative
would provide an added source of
knowledge in honor related func-
tions,

The added representative would
benefit all students. The EC would
gain additional expertise in the clos-
ed hearings, thereby helping to pre-
vent any student from being denied a
fair hearing. The amendment would

also afford the EC an additional ad-
vocate to choose from in event of an
open hearing.

Finally, the additional representa-
tive would help implement the honor
system in the Law School. Law stu-
dents are more likely to know stu-
dents in their own class and would be
less hesitant in reporting potential
violations to someone they knew.
This would facilitate operation of the
honor system University-wide.

I would be happy to answer any
question concerning this amend-
ment. Please give it thoughtful con-
sideration and hopefully all will
realize this amendment is for the
good of the University. Thank you.

Timing, tidbits improper

To the Editors:

I was very disturbed when I read
the editorial in last week’s Ring-tum
Phi (‘EC: No Comment’). The
cause of my concern was not so much
that I disagreed with the content of
the editorial — I did think that it
made some legitimate points — but
that it was said in the wrong way at
the wrong time. Had the article been
printed in a constructive manner ata
time not so near to the elections it
could have been very effective; in-
stead, it was needlessly and blatantly
destructive.

There was some small uproar last
year when the Phi’s mid-term EC re-
port came out. As last week’s editor-
ial said, ‘‘For some EC members, the
midterm review has — justifiably or
not hurt their re-election
chances.”’ Given this statement and
the headline of the editorial, | made
the (obviously foolish) assumption
that The Phi had decided to act re-
sponsibly and hold their report until
after EC elections when the effect of
potentially biased or sloppy jour-
nalism would be purely academic.
Instead The Phi chose to print an edi-
torial which not only contradicted the
headline of what could have been a
statement of journalistic respon-
sibility, but may, in fact, have been
more harmful than any mid-year re-
port could have been.

The mid-year report would have
listed-the voting and attendance re-

cords of the various members, gener-
ally sticking to facts and (one hopes)
avoiding generalizations. Instead we
were treated to one long general-
ization full of catty comments like
(re: the confidentiality of the Honor
System) ‘‘Just stick around the C-
School library — you're bound to pick
up some juicy tidbits.’’ That’s not
journalism or editorial responsibility
— it sounds instead like the words of
someone with a personal ax to grind
against specific EC members. Thus,
the entire committee is indicted
rather than those individuals who
may, in fact, be irresponsible or be
poor leaders. Does it really serve
anyone to make a statement like
‘Some have taken their duty serious-
ly and have represented their classes
well’’? It informs me of nothing and
only irritates the various members,
each of whom thinks he is one of the
unnamed select.

The Phi’s editorial was counter-
productive, angering many members
of the student body and of the EC
without being in the least bit informa-
tive. A mid-year report in the style of
previous years would have been pre-
ferable to this year's comment-filled
“No Comment.” Best of all would be
if The Phi had just written their
headline and allowed the student
body to make its own evaluation.

Does The Phi lack direction, initiative?

EDITORS’ NOTE: We were faced
this week with the decision of wheth-
er to print the letter of a former
reporter who had recently been dis-
missed from the staff for cause. The
letter contained a number of charges
based on incomplete, distorted infor-
mation, The temptation was either to
not print the letter or to rebut it.

Should you allow yourself to be slam-
med in your own newspaper? The
answer is simple: It is not our
newspaper. We are very serious in
our conviction that The Ring-tum Phi
is a forum for all students and not
anyone’s personal fiefdom. The
editors should not always have the
last word. Harsh criticism, even if it
seems unwarranted, may help us do
our job better. Airing dirty laundry in
public is never pleasant, but we
decided that if we can dish it out, we
ought to be able totake it.

* ¢ 8

To the Editors:

The Feb 28 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi demonstrates once again our
newspaper’s seeming desire to avoid
controversy.

The Phi’s decision not to run a
midterm analysis of individual EC
members because the EC ‘“‘lacks
direction and initiative’ is sheer
hyprocrisy. It reminds me of a recent
Washington Post editorial which call-
ed Ed Meese unethical, but argued
that the members of the Senate
should confirm Meese’s nomination
anyway because of the lack of ethical
standards on Capitol Hill.

Rather than solving the problems
they attempt to address, these
editorials instead heighten them. At
first glance, last week’s editorial
may have appeared strongly, or even
harshly, worded. But how strong is

Alumnus hurt;

refuses to aid
a coed W&L

To the Editors:

I think your readers should know
what one alumnus thinks about
coeducation at W&L:

Alvin T. Fleishman
Class Agent '41-A
Anderson, S.C.

Dear Al,

As expected, your ‘‘Class Agent”’
letter seeking a contribution to the
W&L Alumni Fund was recently re-
ceived.

I have always been a modest but
faithful contributor because my
Washington and Lee experience was
profoundly important to me.

The importance of the Alumni
Fund cannot be denied; and you have
been one of our most successful and
agreeable Class Agents.

It is with genuine regret, Al, that I
decline to respond to your request
this time. I will not contribute now
nor will I ever again contribute in
any way to Washington & Lee Uni-
versity.

I cannot forgive the unnecessary,
unpardonable, unwarranted, unjusti-
fied and unconscionable, perfidious
action by the Board of Trustees with
respect to coeducation at W&L. I
wish that I like General Washington,
General Lee, President Gaines, Dean
Gilliam, et al, had not lived to ex-
perience the shame that suffocates so
many alumni.

My alma mater has most cruelly
scorned, rejected and abandoned me.
The personal hurt is everlasting.

Washington & Lee was a university
that I attended and from which I
graduated a long time ago. It has
ceased to exist.

slapping the entire EC on the wrist as
compared to singling out individual
members?

“Not every EC member has failed
to measure up,” according to the
editoria]. ‘Some have taken their du-
ty seriously and represented their
classes well.’’

If this is true, why keep us guess-
ing? Why not tell us which represen-
tatives are strong or weak?

The editorial also mentions three
areas that ‘‘the EC has touched on,

* but failed to tackle with the proper

follow-ups.’’ Why didn’t The Phi run
editorials on these issues while they
were issues? Why hasn’t The Phi
taken the. editorial initiative to pro-
vide some added direction for the
EC?

Another issue which The Phi has
failed to follow-up on adequately is
that of blacks at W&L, especially im-
portant because of the announced
dismissal of Dean of Minority Affairs
John White.

On Feb. 17, the first Sunday of the

Washington Holiday, I had a 65-inch
article printed in the Roanoke Times
& World News about the factors at
W&L which make life overly frustra-
ting for blacks. According to one of
The Phi editors, our school news-
paper does not reprint stories from
other papers or let the Roanoke
Times determine what is The Phi’s
news.

This is ridiculous. Even The
Washington Post has _ reprinted
stories from the Roanoke Times. And
if we do not let others determine our
news, why does The Phi print an AP
story about the space shuttle on Nov.
8, 1984, and why has it devoted so
much space to a U.Va. honor trial?
Perhaps these are of interest to W&L
students, but why not print a W&L
story which a number of professors
have termed ‘‘well-done” and ‘‘even
handed’? (I have since had copies

Defense:

MY VIEW
By Jon Zagrodzky

Part 1 of a two-part series

Anyone who is even remotely in-
terested in national policy surely has
given thought to the astronomical in-
creases in defense spending (in both
real and nominal terms) over the last
four years. I think that most would
agree that some sort of improvement
in the armed forces was needed in
1981, and that Reagan has gone a long
way toward achieving this end. Nev-
ertheless, even the staunchest de-
fense spending advocate has to ask
himself, ‘How much is enough?”
and, “‘Will we ever be adequately
defended?”

To answer this question, we must
shift the debate from types of wea-
pons systems and overall defense
spending to what exactly defines our
general defense needs. I perceive
four distinct challenges in this area.
In this column, I shall address the
threat posed by the Soviet Union, and
in the next one I shall discuss threats
posed by other nations, including
conventional and economic warfare
as well as terrorism.

The first, the most obvious and the
most dangerous threat is that posed
by the USSR. Our current policy is to
spend in excess of $100 billion a year
defending Europe, Japan and the
Pacific from Soviet conventional or
nuclear attack, the latter of which is
being adequately met. But are we de-
fending the U.S. by spending this
money? The answer is no. In fact, the
majority of our defense budget is
spent defending other people, and it
is time that we started alleviating
this burden on the U.S. taxpayer.

For those who claim that U.S.
defense starts in Europe, I submit
that the only direct threat to the U.S.
from the USSR is nuclear, not con-

placed on reserve at the University
Library).

Instead, The Phi chose to print
some of the chief editor’s ‘selected
scribblings from a notebook” kept
while partying at the University of
North Carolina during break.

I am not asking why he had to take
notes during these parties. But why
should we care if he and a group of
UNC students walked into a sorority,
uninvited, at three o’clock in the
morning? When asked what they
were doing, our chief editor said (and
I quote), ‘“‘We’re thinking of buying
this place and we're just giving
ourselves a tour. May I help you?”’

Perhaps there are instances where
we all exhibit less-than-gentlemanly
behavior, but why brag about it in the
school newspaper?

And why, in past issues have we
had an abundance of one-time-only
“My View’’ columnists? If these peo-
ple wish to speak on a particular sub-
ject, then they should write letters to

the editor. One of these columnists
was the incoming president of this
same chief editor’s fraternity. Such
columns show potential conflicts of
interest and destroy the credibility
and purpose of the ‘“‘My View’’ col-
umn.

The Phi could regain some
credibility by reviving the ‘‘Readers’
Advocate’ column, Mike Hudson, a
varsity basketball player and senior
journalism major with whom I am
associated through my work at the
Roanoke Times, said he was asked to
serve as the readers’ advocate before
the school year s arted.

According to Hudson, The Phi
editors wished to edit his column for
content. Hudson said he produced a
column concerning a story written
last year by Mike Allen. According to
Hudson, Allen obtained an exclusive
interview with Scot Mesner by call-
ing Mesner immediately following

How safe

ventional, and that our defense struc-
ture against Soviet attack should in-
clude ICBMs, Trident submarines,
the Strategic Defense Initiative, etc.
I would also suggest that if we intend
to defend Europe, then an enormous
increase in spending commitments to
shore up NATO conventional forces
is in order. To meet the Warsaw Pact
challenge, a much larger quantity of
U.S. men, money and material will
have to be sacrificed by the
American taxpayer. The political
will to make this sacrifice does not
exist. To the economist who says that
we need viable European markets, I
say that any benefit we gain from
trade with Europe is absorbed ten-
fold by the money we spend defen-
ding Europe. Europe should have
assumed its own defense in 1949, and

Hudson wrote that Allen had
scooped all of the local papers, in-
cluding the Roanoke Times. Accord-
ing to Hudson, chief editors Allen and
Bruce Potter wanted this informa-
tion deleted because they did not
want people to think that The Phi was
competing with the Times.

Hudson also wrote that he had writ-
ten the column at Allen’s request.
Hudson told me that Allen had
wanted this deleted because students
might infer that there were very
close ties between the editors and the
readers’ advocate. But in asking
Hudson to delete the statement, the
editors were performing the exact
actions that they wanted to hide from
the public.

“I wonder what would happen if I
wrote an article which criticized The
Phi editors,’’ Hudson told me.

These are jusi a portion of the
many incidents where The Phi has
apnarently avoided controversy and
shown a lack of direction and in-
itiative. There is no reason why such
incidents must occur. As an objective
newspaper, The Phi must realize that
all men (and women) are created
equal, and thus show integrity and
honesty.

As an editorial forum, The Phi
must allow for a divergence of opin-
ions, It cannot solve problems by put-
ting on blinders, and cannot gain
respect without being fair and honest
with the W&L community. Certainly,
The Phi, like the EC, must itself show
some direction and initiative.

right to edit this letter. If any editing

Europe nas the capacity to defend
itself, as a bloc — it out-produces the
U.S. economically. Once we realize
that the threat of a Soviet attack on
the U.S. is a nuclear and not conven-

sources to provide for its own de-
fense, it becomes clear that defend-
ing the U.S. with nuclear weapons
and allowing Europe to defend itself
is an infinitely better policy.

Wa&L studies Davidson’s transition to coed

 

, By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington Holiday visit to Davidson reassured
members of the Coeducation Steering Committee that
. Washington and Lee was preparing properly for the ar-

rival of its first coed class.
* Associate Dean of the College Pamela H. Simpson,
. who heads the coed committee, Executive Assistant to

the President Frank A. Parsons and Director of
* Athletics William D. McHenry met with more than a
, dozen Davidson administrators, faculty members and

students during their day-and-a-half visit to discuss how
* Davidson had handled the transition to coeducation a
decade ago.

“We were so reassured. They didn’t tell us anything
that we hadn’t thought of already. We had at least

<

 

-Coeducation:

What Will It Mean?

thought of everything they had mentioned,”’ said Simp-
* son, referring to problems Davidson encountered while
, becoming a coed college.

“The overall attitude was that we had a very reassur-
* ing visit,’ said Parsons, echoing Simpson’s opinion.

, ‘We'd already been thinking about most of the things

that had been identified at Davidson as potential pro-

lems.”
, Davidson provides a particularly good example of the
problems W&L might encounter in the first few years of
* coeducation because before Davidson went coed the two

, Schools had been thought of more or less as peers, Simp-

* son said. After Davidson went coed, though, it began

» attracting students with higher SAT’s and began receiv-

ing more grant money than W&L.

” Simpson said she came away from the visit believing
+that Davidson is a very good school that has its
academic priorities in order.
“There are certainly things we can learn from
. them,” she added.

One of the differences that Simpson did note between
the two schools was that Davidson had almost no ex-
. perience with women on campus as students before it
decided to go coed, Simpson said. Davidson had not
‘even had any women exchange students until a few
«years before the school decided to become coeduca-
tional, she explained.

" W&L does not have that problem because the school
vhas had women as exchange students, special students
and law students, Simpson noted.

 

 

‘EC questions suggested position
for woman on Student Control

Partially as a result of this lack of experience with
women on campus, Davidson adopted a policy of reac-
ting to problems when they arise rather than trying to
anticipate every problem, Simpson said.

“They are very supportive and very responsive to
student concerns,” she added.

One problem Davidson officials warned the commit-
tee members about that they had not discussed much
before was that of eating disorders among bright, upper
middle-class women, Simpson and Parsons said. David-
son officials said that about 30 of 525 women students on
campus had some kind of eating disorder, including
bulimia and anorexia nervosa.

Both Parsons and Simpson said that they were im-
pressed with the attitude Davidson took toward making

sure that campus lighting was adequate to ensure the
safety of women students.

If a woman at Davidson complains that a spot on
campus is too dark, additional lighting is put in im-
mediately, Simpson said.

Parsons said that before Davdison had female
students the campus had been ‘‘dark as pitch.’’ Now the
Davidson campus is well lighted, he added.

“In general, I hope we can acquire a lighting system
as effective. If any of our women students feel insecure
anywhere, they’ll have to tell us about it, and we'll have
to remedy it,” Parsons said.

Sixteen additional lights will be erected on campus
where the deep rectangular holes along the sidewalks
are now, Parsons said.

Coed committee concerned
about sexual harassment

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Does speculation about someone’s
virginity constitute sexual harass-
ment?

Would a University code discour-
aging sexual jokes make students
more sensitive, or would it lead to

_ “academic fascism’’?

What should happen to a professor
who carries the ‘‘casting couch” con-
cept onto the campus?

Those were among the topics on the
table as the University Council and
Coeducation Steering Committee
met jointly Thursday to discuss sex-
ual harassment and how it should be
handled at a coeducational Washing-
ton and Lee.

Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, head of the Co-
education Steering Committee, said
the committee will revise the first
draft of its policy statement on sex-
ual harassment, which the Univer-
sity Council had seen.

In her opening comments to the
UC, Simpson said the main type of
sexual harassment being discussed
in the statement involves the abuse of
power by an administrator or pro-
fessor through sexual coercion.
Although cases of students sexually
harassing other students will be

punished as conduct unbecoming a
W&L student by the Student Control
Committee, such harassment might
fall within the bounds of Title IX,
Simpson said.

Several members of the University
Council said the students and faculty
must be informed of the contents of
the final University statement on
sexual harassment.

A second concern of University
Council members was that an estab-
lished procedure be set up for hand-
ling complaints of harassment.

Simpson said it did not matter what
the procedure was as long as one
were established. The goal of the
procedure should be to ensure that
the harassment is stopped, she said
— not to force an administrator to
punish a faculty member for every
incident. Reform and education is
what is needed, Simpson argued.

“I’m not particularly concerned
with the procedure that is set up,”
said Commerce School Dean Edward
C. Atwood Jr. ‘“‘But I think there
should be a procedure.”

Simpson suggested that an appro-
priate procedure might be for the stu-
dent who is harassed by a professor
to go to the head of the department or
to the appropriate dean.

Dean of the College John W. Elrod
said that a dean who is informed of
sexual harassment could often talk to

the faculty member involved rather
than take formal action. Many times
a professor might not have intended
to sexually harass a student, Elrod
added.

“What’s important is to become
sensitive to this as an issue,’ he said.
“Hopefully, it won’t get to the point
where a dean will have to get invovl-
ed in formal actions.”’

History Professor Henry P. Porter
Jr. said he was worried that one of
the clauses in the first draft of the
statement could lead to ‘‘academic
fascism.”’ Porter said enforcement of
the clause could lend itself to abuse.

The clause in question says, ‘‘Other
types of sexual harassment include:
sexual jokes, slurs, speculations
about virginity, sexually explicit
derogatory statements, sexually

ting remarks to cause dis-
comfort and/or humiliation to reci-
pient.”’

Assistant history Professor John
D. Parker said that the goal of the
clause seemed to be to inform people
of the type of behavior thst might be
considered sexual harassment. It
might be better to rewrite the clause
to say that ‘‘at some times sexual
harassment may include...” instead
of “other types of sexual harassment
include....”" Parker said. Not all sex-
ual jokes may be harassment, for ex-
ample, Parker explained.

+ The Coeducation Steering Commit-
tee’s recommendations that a fresh-
“man woman be appointed as a non-
*voting member to the Student Con-
_trol Committee was discussed by the
“Executive Committee Monday night.

- Junior representative Michael
_Black presented the resolution to the
“EC last week, and the topic was dis-
vcussed at length this week. The EC
did not make any decision on the
“"policy, but instead tabled it until next

week.

EC members questioned whether a
‘female ad hoc member would be
meeded once a female was actually
elected to the Student Control Com-
“mittee. In other words, would this
»measure hold as a permanent policy
,or would it only be a temporary
‘policy until women are well-estab-
‘lished in campus affairs?

This new measure also brought up
“the question of whether the female ad
rhoc member would represent a ‘‘min-
ority group,”’ in which case the ques-
‘tion of a black ad hoc member or a
foreign exchange ad hoc member
would have to be considered.
* Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers said he thinks that once a
woman wins an election, there would
‘be no need for an ad hoc member.
» “It would increase fairness and the
perception of fairness,’’ Caruthers
‘said.
, Other EC members, including
Black, said that a female ad hoc
‘member should be appointed when-

     
   
       
   
       
   

ever a woman fails to winan election.

The resolution states: ‘‘Most sim-
ply, we fear that women confronting
an all-male board will not feel them-
selves to be confronting peers.”’

Caruthers also said that perhaps
this year’s EC could endorse the
resolution and that next year’s EC
could ratify it if they feel it’s
necessary.

The resolution was partly as a re-
sult of a 14-hour discussion by the
University Council concerning the U-
niversity policy on sexual discrimi-
nation, (See related story this page).

In other business, the Calyx an-
nounced that all fraternities that fail

to pay for their picture this year will
have a blank page in the yearbook
saying the fraternity ‘‘did not pay.”
Old debts also must be paid to avoid
that notation. In addition, fraterni-
ties that fail to pay might be excluded
from the Rush Book.

In addition, the Film Society pre-
sented its budget report to the EC
and announced that it earned $83
from last weekend’s showing of ‘‘Lo-
cal Hero.”

Finally, the Student Telephone
Union brought up a request to have
its chairmen paid. The idea was in:

Regarding campus security, until recently, Davidson
students had been against having dormitory floors
secured by locks, Parsons said. Students had
demonstrated their dislike for the secure floors by
removing the locks or the even ripping doors off their
hinges and wanted the freedom of visitation between
dorm floors, Parsons said.

But after a rape in a dorm room about a month ago,
there has been a push by Davidson students for tighter
security, Parsons said. Parsons said a Davidson official
told him that in the past students have grown tired of
the additional security arrangements and have remov-
ed the locks a few months after an assault in the dorms.

Parsons said he thought that W&L would probably
have locked secure floors for its women next year, but
after learning about the Davidson experience he
wondered how successful a security measure the locked
halls would be. He added that it was up to the students
living on the hall to make sure the floors stayed secure.

Parsons said that the housing situation at Davidson
reinforced his opinion that W&L’s housing situation is
unusual. Davidson seeks to house 90 percent of its
students on campus, while only 40 percent of W&L
students live on campus.

Thus, while Davidson has traditional, long-corridor
dorms with double occupancy rooms, W&L must pro-
vide more attractive, modern housing in order to be
competitive with local private housing, Parsons said.

Some of the changes in the dining hall planned at
W&L next year are similar to the arrangements the
committee members saw at the Davidson dining hall,
Parsons said.

At the suggestion of female law students, the dining
hall will have a variety of table sizes next year so that
regardless of the size of a group they can find a table
where they can eat in relative privacy.

Davidson had a similar arrangement in its dining hall
with different sizes and shapes of tables rather than the
traditional rectangular tables, Parsons said. The table
arrangements contribute to a relaxed and informal at-
mosphere in the dining hall, Parsons said.

Despite all the changes Davidson has made since go-
ing coed, there is still some sexism on the Davidson
campus, Simpson said.

Members of the Women’s Concerns Committee at
Davidson told the W&L administrators that an attitude
still prevails at Davidson that the school’s traditions
belong only to the male students, Simpson said. Only
men in the school’s chorus are allowed to sing the
school’s fight song, she said. And a common saying
around campus is that ‘‘a Davidson man needs no in-
troduction,’ Simpson added.

Parsons said that women at Davidson also had com-
plained that more female professors were needed
because there was a preponderance of men on the facul-
ty.

Davidson administrators are trying to address
women’s concerns, Simpson said. She noted that David-
son was trying to bring more prominent women on cam-
pus as guest speakers because there are not enough
female role models on campus.

 

You knew who you could talk to about it.”’

“The worst thing about pledgeship is getting back
from break and still being a pledge after having all that
freedom,” Campbell continued. ‘I’m glad I’ve been
through it — but once is enough.”

Jeff Lovell, who until last weekend was a ‘“‘maggot’’
at Kappa Sigma, said all the extra activities at the
house allowed him to get to know some people he had
not known as well. Cleanup was the worst part of
pledgeship, he said.

“T’d rather write an English paper for Ms. Dunbar
than clean up the house after a party,”’ he said.

Blair Severe of Sigma Phi Epsilon said that pledge-
ship overall was “‘a great time — you're only a pledge
once. ”

“You look back on it and there were a lot of good
times and laughs,”’ he said.

The next pattern Shields traced
was the history of election landslides.
In the two previous presidental land-
slides, Shields said, the votes were
not so much for a candidate, but
against his opponent. Shields cited
the Johnson/Goldwater election of
1964 and the Nixon/McGovern race.
In last fall’s race, Shields said, it was
a pro-Reagan election, rather than
an anti-Mondale one.

Shields then examined some of
Reagan’s policies and said that if
they are looked at independently,
they represent political suicide. An
astronomical federal deficit ordinari-
ly would not be accepted by the
American people. Nor, he said, would
Reagan’s “hot fudge sundae diet”’ for
the budget problem.

Reagan wants to balance the bud-
get, Shields said. To do this, he pro-
poses to cut taxes and double the bud-
get allotment for defense. These
things, like attempting to lose weight
on a diet of hot fudge sundaes, won’t
work, Shields said. All it will result
in, he added, is ‘fiscal fatty thighs.”

Group favors open library ©

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

The Library Advisory Committee
recommended Monday that the Uni-
versity Library maintain its 24-hour
schedule.

The decision was the result of con-
cern expressed by some faculty
members that in the future the li-
brary might operate on a restricted
daily schedule. The library is open 24
hours a day during the academic
year.

There were reports earlier this
year that closing the library from
midnight until 8 a.m. would save
money. Committee chairman and
history Professor Lamar J.R. Cecil
Jr. asked if any of the committee
knew where these reports originated.
The best guess the group had was an

Dog patrols
stepped up

Campus patrols by the city animal
control agent have been stepped up in
response to a request by University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley, Police
Chief L.O. Sutton said this week.

“We have been asked for assis-
tance and will render such,” said Sut-
ton, who met with Epley last Thurs-
day.

“The animal control agent will
patrol campus and will attempt to
remove all problem dogs — dogs run-
ning at large, that sort of thing,’’ he
said.

“Apparently a great number of
people have gotten lax, and controll-
ing the dogs is a problem,”’ he added.

He said the problems are caused by
the number of dogs as well as the
lack of control of them by their own-
ers. “They’re having problems with
them entering buildings, being
neglected’ and so forth, he said.

Sutton said loose dogs wil] be taken
to the local SPCA, and the owner will
be issued a summons for allowing a
dog to run at large.

III, at Read’s request, impaneled a
special grand jury to investigate
Rockbridge area drug trafficking.
The special grand jury, an in-
vestigative body that may not indict,
called more than 200 witnesses over a
seven-month period.

Pack’s attorneys had asked in a
written motion that the VMI
testimony be excluded because
“through deceit and in breach of the
attorney-client relationship, infor-
mation which the defendant confided
to Mr. Read....came back to haunt
him through the vehicle of the special
grand jury.”

Shannon Spencer, a defense
witness who identified herself as
Pack’s girlfriend, testified that when
she was called before the special
grand jury, she was asked if Pack us-
ed drugs. She said she had seen him
do so twice. -

The alleged transfer of information
about Pack from Read to the special
grand jury ‘“‘is a breach that you
can’t overlook,’ Ahern said. ‘It
doesn’t matter if they got informa-
tion from other sources.”

Jury foreman Blackburn, the
mayor of Glasgow and the only pro-
secution witness, testified that the

article in the Jan. 24 Ring-tum Phi,
which reported that the administra-
tion was studying the possibility of
shortened library hours.

Included in the committee’s re-
commendation was the condition that
the overnight operation of the library
stay within “existing or reasonable
costs.’’ The committee also will re-
commend that the library be opened
on a restricted schedule on several
weekends during the year when it is
currently closed.

Specifically, the committee recom-
mended that the library be opened on
the weekend before the start of fresh-
man orientation week so that incom-
ing freshmen and their parents can
visit the building. Although the

Lacrosse controls Duke, 8-6
————— a

 

‘By STEVE GREENEBAUM
Staff Reporter

 

» Saturday was a picture perfect day

for the opening of the 1985 lacrosse
‘season: 3,002 fans in attendance and
ithe sun shining on Wilson field. But
the Duke Blue Devils never had a
‘chance to enjoy the beautiful weather
-as the Generals defeated them 8-6.

The first period was a tight battle,
‘but the Generals gained a 2-1 advan-
jtage after 15 minutes of play. It was
in the second quarter that the
‘Generals took control and managed a
.5-2 lead before half. Even with this
three-goal lead, the Generals were
“determined not to lose their intensity
.in the second half.

“Coach (Dennis) Daly pointed out
our problems with shots on offense
and with our man-to-man coverage
on defense,"' said senior goaltender
‘John DiDuro. “The attitude in the
locker room was everyone wanted to
finish the job and we were only half
‘done.’ DiDuro had a sensational
+game with 18 saves and one assisted
goal to junior attackman Bill
“Holmes.

», But in the second half the tide turn-
ed and the Blue Devils began to move
“the ball with little trouble. When the
,Generals' lead was cut to two goals,
the thoughts of deja vu could be
‘heard in the stands from the field.
Last year the Generals led 7-2 at the
half and barely escaped with a 10-9

’ ‘victory. But this year the Generals

-held on and continued to play their

own game and rose to an 8-6 victory.

“We did a lot of things well, but
;most importantly we controlled the
tempo of the game," Daly said. ‘We
“controlled the face-offs, our rides and
clears were effective and we showed
a lot of poise. We also shot very well,
éspecially in the first half.”’

, The Washington and Lee Tennis
team opened its season by splitting
"its first two matches, losing a close
confrontation to Division I Penn
State, 5-3-1, and dominating Division
“III Averett College team, 8-1.

, Inthe Penn State match, W&L split
the six singles matches. The No. 1
‘and No. 2 players, freshmen Jack
«Messerly and David McLeod, along
with No, 4, senior captain Andy Har-
‘ing, lost their matches to strong Penn
State players in straight sets. The
Generals were stronger than the Nit-
*tany Lions in the bottom half of the
slineup as a sophomore Roby Mize at
No. 3 freshman Chris Wiman at No. 5

‘and junior Scott Adams at No. 6 all

«won their matches to tie the singles
competition at 3-3.

‘IT was pleased, but Duke’s man
wasn't as skilled as what I expect to
see in the upcoming weeks,"’ Schoen-
berg said.

‘My wings did a great job — we
are all happy with our perfor-
mance.”

On the offense, senior attackmen
Jeff Mason and Sandy Brown played
agressive game; each had two goals.
Brown's efficiency on the field earn-
ed him the title of player of the game.

‘Brown did a super job on the en-
tire field. Offensively he scored twice
and defensively he responded well
when Duke had the ball,”’ Daly said.

In a final look at the Duke game,
the Generals played a spotless first
half but the second half was one of
poor shot selection. Daly felt the of-
fense should have played better ball
control and run out the clock instead
of forcing shots. But the team never
lost its poise and the new offense-
defense line-up without midfielder

matches, securing the victory for
Penn State. The inconsequential No.
2 doubles match of Mize and fresh-
man Mory Watkins was halted after
two split sets due todarkness.

Although it lost, the team had a
positive view of Friday's match. ‘‘We
had strong performances from Mize,
Wiman and Adams,” Coach Gary
Franke said. ‘‘We just didn’t have
that extra punch in doubles.”’

Messerly had similar feelings
about the doubles competition. ‘‘We
just haven’t had many opportunities
like that to play really good doubles,”
he said.

Haring also had good feelings
about the opener and pointed out the
improvement over last year’s meet-
ing. ‘They beat us 9-0 last year so the
closeness of the match gave us the
confidence that we can doit.”

In Monday’s match against Aver-
ett College, the team took command,
losing only at No. 1 singles, to
Averett’s Tapio Martti, who used an
arsenal of control and power to beat
Messerly 6-2, 6-3 in a match that

proved successful.

This Saturday, the Generals will
meet what should be the toughest
team on their schedule, the Universi-
ty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The Generals lead the series, 17-12,
but have not beaten the Tar Heels
since 1978.

UNC is being billed as a tough and
physical team and it’s one Wash-
ington and Lee wants to beat
desperately.

“Our emphasis now is to improve
the problems we had with Duke,”
Brown said. “But to win everyone
has to put it on the lines and play the
game of our lives. We have to main-
tain mental intensity — Carolina is
Carolina and it’s going to be a heated
game. If we can win this one there is
no telling what we can do.”’

Assistant Coach Bob Shaps ex-
plained that the Generals need to
control the the tempo and wait for
high percentage shots. UNC is very

factor in the victory.

explosive and will take any advan-
tage they can find. The Generals’
defense will need to shut down the
Tar Heels early and continue through
the entire game. Everyone agrees
that the Generals need to play tough
for the whole 60 minutes and every
second will count.

“If we play the second half like we
played Duke, we will get killed,”
Schoenberg said.

The team is reported as being
healthy with everyone ready to play
this week. The attitude of the
Generals is good and they are once
again enjoying the sport now that the
season has arrived, and being
undefeated is a good feeling too.

“We are on an upswing after the
Duke win, and I hope we can continue
in that direction this week,’’ Daly
said. ‘‘The game will give us a good
indication as to how far we have
come.”

State, drub Averett

coach Franke termed ‘‘a disappoint-
ment.”’

As the members of the Averett
team walked off the court they had
the look of people who knew from the
outset that they were playing a team
that far surpassed them in ability.
They seemed glad to have just played

as well as the 8-1 tally allowed.

Today at 3 p.m. the team was
slated to play Slippery Rock College,
a team that Coach Franke said
“should. be better than Averett,
though you never know with these
teams that can vary so much from
one year to the next.”’

Another title won
by track dynasty

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee indoor
track team won its second consecu-
tive Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence championship Saturday at
Lynchburg College. Generals’ head
coach Norris Aldridge was named
the ODAC’s indoor track Coach-of-
the-Year.

The Generals captured first place
with 157 points. Lynchburg and Roa-
noke followed with 146 and 57 points
respectively.

W&L captured first place in five of
the ten individual events. Generals
Andy White (60 yard hurdles), Chris
McGowan (440), Bill Rhinehardt (60
yard dash), Mark Pembroke (880)
and Matt Steilberg (pole vault) took
first place in their events.

The Generals won all three relays.

Murdock’s troops are not underdogs anymore

 

.

, By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
"team lost three starting infielders to
«graduation last year, two of whom

, were all-ODAC players and four-year
starters.

This development would tend to

., lead one to believe that 1985 will be a

rebuilding season for the Generals.
»Don’t tell that to W&L head coach
Jim Murdock.
Murdock is looking for his team to
-improve upon last season’s 11-12
record, the most victories recorded
~ by a General team since 1972.
W&L was one of the hottest teams
in the ODAC during the second half of
“ the 1984 season, winning seven of its
11 games and finishing second in the
conference tournament.
“T really believe we'll have a good
season,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘We don’t
see ourselves as the real underdog

>

’ ‘anymore.”’

Murdock, in his fourth season at

W&L, believes that more than ade-
* quate replacements have already

been found for graduated infielders
Dave Warrenfeltz, Mike Walsh and

» Kevin Golden. The revamped infield,

combined with the return of the en-
tire pitching staff, starting catcher

. and two starting outfielders, could

enable W&L to challenge for the
ODAC title.
The pitching staff undoubtedly will

' be the Generals’ strong suit. Senior

co-captain Billy White, 6-2 in 1984,
finished second in the nation among

' Division ITI pitchers last season with

his 1.09 earned run average. White,
who was named to the second all-
ODAC team in 1984, had a string of
37'4 innings without giving up an
earned run last season,

Joining White in the starting rota-
tion is junior Kirk Breen, a right-
hander Murdock has said looked
“tremendous” in preseason prac-

tices. Sophomore lefthander Bill Sch-
oettelkotte, who performed well: at
times last season, will be the third
starter.

Junior Peter Detlefs will be W&L’s
stopper in the bullpen. Freshman
Carter Steuart, who possesses ‘‘great
potential,’ according to Murdock,
will be used as a long reliever. Sopho-
more Dave Howard and freshmen
Eric Acra and Sully Renuart round
out the General pitching staff.

Handling the pitching staff will be
senior catcher Mike Jacoby. Jacoby,
a co-captain with White, has improv-
ed offensively, according to Mur-
dock. Jacoby will be backed up by
sophomore Bill Curtiss.

The infield will be led by sopho-
more third baseman Milam Turner,
who topped the Generals in batting
last season with a .361 average. Tur-
ner, who was named second team
All-ODAC in 1984, split time between
third base and left field last season.

White will play shortstop when not
pitching. Murdock said that junior
Chris Jakubek will spell both Turner
and White.

Junior Chris Militello and Curtiss

will battle for the starting position at
first base. Militello is the better de-
fensive player while Curtiss posses-
ses a more potent bat, Murdock said.

‘‘We will be stronger defensively in
the infield,’ Murdock said. ‘‘We have
better speed and will be able to get a
few more balls hit up the middle. Of-
fensively, it remains to be seen. On
the whole, we’ll be better if anything
is hit in the infield.”’

The outlook for the Generals’ out-
field is somewhat clouded as a result
of injuries suffered by several key
players. Junior centerfielder Hugh
Finkelstein is still nursing a knee in-
jury from football but should be
ready for the season opener. Finkels-
tein led the Generals in stolen bases
in 1984.

Senior rightfielder Chip Hutchins,
a steady performer in 1984, has been
hampered by a shoulder injury dur-
ing the preseason and will probably
miss the first game. Behind Hutchins
is Adam Yanez, a sophomore who
showed flashes of brilliance last sea-
son,

ior Tom Mack and Ricky Zahn, are

competing for the starting nod in left
field. Murdock said both have pulled
leg muscles but should be available
for the season opener,

“We have very capable people in
the outfield,’’ Murdock said. “We
just need to get them healthy.”

Murdock described his team’s pre-

season practice as ‘‘very produc-
tive.”’

Murdock said W&L’s strong show-
ing in the ODAC tournament has af-
fected his team’s attitude going into
the 1985 season.

“The tournament has carried over
a great deal,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘We
developed a lot of confidence and now
understand that we have the person-
nel to win.”’

Murdock sees perennial powers
Randolph-Macon College and Lynch-
burg College as the preseason favor-
ites in the ODAC. He believes W&L
should finish in the top four in the
conference.

W&L opens its season Saturday at
home against Christopher Newport
in a doubleheader at 1 p.m. The
Generals play at Virginia Wesleyan
on Monday at 3 p.m.

collegiate sports world. Or at least

“jet us hope ney are apt. And one has every reason to believe they are.

And just what is the babbling Ring-tum Phi sports idiot venturing
toward (that is, talking about) now? Well, Lexington is the home of
two sports teams looking to serve notice that they are ready and able
to compete with the big boys. Got it, yet?

How about this? One’s season is getting under way and the other’s
— barring something unforeseen, but in a way not all that undeserved
— has come to an uproarious conclusion. The former has started with
a win, the latter has ended with a loss.

I'll prolong the non-existent suspense no longer. If we’re talking
about this fine city’s two teams looking to turn over new leaves, we've
got to talk W&L Lacrosse and VMI Basketball.

It warms this heart — and, indeed, most would say that’s a feat that
requires some doing — to see people excited about athletic competi-
tion again, and with the early appearance of Southern Conference
tournament final.

Perhaps I’m being a bit premature (most would say immature)
about the prowess of the local boys, but I prefer to go on with the
dream,

VMI and head coach Marty Fletcher deserve the admiration of
every one of us. The Keydets went into the Southern Conference tour-
nament in Asheville, N.C., last weekend — the first time in four years
they’ve been invited to the league’s post-season festivities — and let’s
just say they turned more than a few heads (as in try and catch us if
you can) on their way to the runner-up slot.

Needless to say, VMI was in the role of underdog in Asheville, and
they played it to the hilt, including a couple of overtime wins and an
upset of the tourney’s top seed.

The result was missing an NCAA bid — you know, the big one that’s
going to be on TV all the time in the next few weeks— by only five
points. More importantly, however, the Keydets finished at 16-14,
that’s more wins than the seniors have seen the previous three cam-
paigns and only the fourth .500-plus mark in 43 years. They have serv-
ed notice — and this isn’t wishful thinking — that they can and will be a
force, and that we just might be seeing CBS or NBC — that’s as in
Brent & Billy & Dick & Al — trucks pulling up outside of Cameron Hall
in the not-all-too-unfathomable future.

The W&L signs of rebirth are in their initial stages at present, but
one was certainly given a good, positive feeling after Saturday after-
noon’s performance on Wilson Field.

As a freshman, an astute observer of the W&L lacrosse phenomenon
noted that the key to good lacrosse lay with the man between the posts,
and if that’s the case — it’s certainly a big contributor — the Generals
can be happy with Saturday’s key performance by netminder John
DiDuro (18 saves).

In a year that head coach Dennis Daly and his troops have
unabashedly devoted to simply being ‘‘the best we can be,”’ one can be
pleased with the start of W&L Lacrosse '85. It’s an attitude one can
sense about this year’s team, a willingness to do what's necessary for
the best possible results and a willingness to take those results as they
come, Staring at UNC, Maryland and the WahooChildren in a row,
there’s no question the test will be quite stern. Here’s a guess the
Generals aren’t going to back down for anybody.

In the end, it’s good to see fan enthusiasm and better to see it
rewarded. Let us hope the Keydets and Generals have started a couple
of trends...

* * *

....Waltzing (or is it jitterbugging) past the Colonnade, a much-
deserved tip of the cap to Norris Aldridge and his track and field team
as they proved once again they are masters of the great indoors in the
ODAC by claiming Saturday’s conference indoor championships, Can
you say ‘‘dynasty’’?....And while you’re working on that one, make
sure you take a gander at the baseball team, who was a late-night
game away from last year’s ODAC crown. A good deal of the person
from a year ago are back....with confidence. Keep a watchful eye in
this direction. And while we’re at it, rumor has it that a few baseball
games may reach the airwaves via WLUR. Stay tuned...

spring training 20 pounds under last year’s playing weight and then
said in the Rainbow Times (er, USA Today), ‘‘I felt with the money
(about $1.8 million a year) and my pride, I want to play in 162 games.”’
Gee, what a nice guy. At three hours a day for six months, he really
sweats it for $3,333.33 an hour. I know we all would....

Four Tops

could be

top act in pavilion

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
‘The Back Page” Editor

 

The three-day Mink Dynasty
will begin its reign tonight as the
Four Tops headline the Student
Activities Board’s Thursday night
Fancy Dress concert at the stu-
dent activities pavilion.

Despite some confusion, ticket
sales for this concert are far
ahead of the sales for any pre-
vious pavilion concert, according
to SAB Entertainment Director
John Haywood. By yesterday
morning, about 800 advance tic-
kets had been sold. Haywood said
that compares with 200 advance
tickets sold for the Homecoming
concert featuring the Spinners.

Haywood said tickets will be
available at the door and that a
sell-out is expected. ‘‘We should
be able to get everyone in who
wants to get in,”’ he added.

The confusion arose due to a

 

communication problem with the
sophomore class, which is co-
sponsoring the event with the
SAB. George Kinkead, SAB treas-
urer, said the SAB did not know
earlier in the week this was a co-
sponsored event and that class
passes would be honored for ad-
mission to the concert.

As a result, some people who
had purchased class passes also
purchased a ticket for the concert.
Kinkead said refunds will be given
to those students who prove they
have bought a ticket and presenta
class pass. The class pass is only
good for one ticket, so yes, you
still have to shell out $6 for your
date.

The doors for tonight’s show
open at 9 p.m., and the show
begins at 9:30 with the Four Tops’
special guests, Wild Kingdom.
The Four Tops should take the
stage around 11 p.m.

For late FD shoppers, the SAB
will be selling tickets and memor-
abilia until 2 p.m. tomorrow.

Contemporary prints at du Pont

 

By BOB STRICKLAND
Art Critic

 

A traveling exhibit sponsored by
the Virginia Museum is on display in
du Pont Gallery until March 20. The
show consists of contemporary prints
by such artists as Richard Estes, Jo-
seph Cornell, Roy Lichtenstein,
Adolph Gottlieb and Helen Franken-
thaller.

Half of the show consists of Ric-
hard Estes’ ‘Urban Landscapes.”
Estes aims to mimic the camera in
his extremely objective renditions of
cityscapes. Before attempting a
piece, Estes takes a number of photo-
graphs of a proposed landscape and
then combines certain aspects of
each photo to recreate the scene. Al-
though his work imitates the photo-
graph, he achieves an effect that
many photographs are unable to
achieve: All elements of the composi-
‘tion are in sharp focus. Some ‘“‘pu-
rist’’ photorealists go as far as pro-
jecting a positive image onto the can-
vas and then trace in the image.

Most of Estes’ landscapes are
street scenes of New York’s Upper
West Side, where he lives. He is in-
terested in painting the world around
him. Estes’ artistic sight is purely ob-
jective; he paints what he sees, with-
out comment. Like Edward Hopper,
Estes sees a concrete world without
people or life. He examines the loneli-
ness of an urban landscape consist-
ing mostly of concrete, steel and
glass. Although Estes has the objec-
tivity of a Pop artist, he is concen-
trating only on a particular problem
of modern culture. Indeed, he could
have chosen a busy afternoon in Cen-
tral Park as the subject of his land-
scape, transforming the city into the
hub of civilization.

In ‘560’’ Estes emphasizes the
sterility of the urban world in the
gray reflections of a large plate-
glass. The setting is devoid of human
life. But from a stylistic point of
view, the work bears a rich photo-
realist style. Estes examines illu-
sions and reflections in the highly
reflective subjects of his works. One
can discover a myriad of reflections
of objects and buildings superimpos-

ed upon the large plate-glass. Estes
delights in visual deceptions and the
ambiguity of space in a modern, ur-
ban environment.

Although “‘Grants”’ is still free of
people, the work becomes more live-
ly with the busy glows of neon signs
and lights. The work reflects the fast-
paced lifestyle and the quick, dispos-
able nature of urban culture.

Another artist in the show who de-
lights in the trappings of the modern
world is Robert Rauschenberg. In
“Horsefeathers Thirteen No. 111”
(1972), Rauschenberg takes bits and
pieces from our mass-media culture,
and out of these fragments, he
creates a patchworked cross-section
of America. The title itself suggests
the colloquial and everyday. The ele-
ments of the collage are also every-

day and quite random: a tomato is.

juxtaposed against ice cubes; a sec-
tion of a map is placed against a
Japanese newspaper advertisement.
Against the mundane, Rauschenberg
places two collage pieces of higher
art, including part of a medieval bat-
tle scene. He delights in creating sub-
tle associations between images in
his collages as well as contrasts and
comparisons.

Another artist who enjoys working
with the medium of collage is Joseph
Cornell. Although Cornell is not as-
sociated with any formal art move-
ments, the European surrealists dis-
covered and supported him earlier in
this century. Cornell’s first show in
1932 included collages of unrelated
images he began to collect, including
old books, engravings and objects
that evoked other eras, other times
and other spaces. By arranging a col-
lection of bits and pieces of the world
in his collage, Cornell sought to evoke
the mysterious and the subconscious
links of logic and associations buried
deep within the mind.

Cornell explores the nature of geo-
metry and astronomy in one of his
untitled screen prints from 1972. A
series of cubes is placed against a cy-

Join Us For

linder and cone, all of which lie
beneath a burning sun. Superimpos-
ed over the sun is an astronomical il-
lustration. Like the surrealists, Cor-
nell attempted to tap into the collec-
tive of mankind in order to acquire
and develop images and symbols for
his art.

Adolph Gottlieb’s untitled work
from 1972 is another that plays upon
images of the collective subconscious
of mankind. The work is typical of
Gottlieb: A glowing orb appears ho-
vering above the lower area of ex-
pressionistic brushwork. The work
takes the viewer back to the times of
cave art, when ideas were expressed
through symbols and simple shapes.
Like the work of Cornell, Gottlieb
evokes the early civilizations of man-
kind.

Helen Frankenthaller’s ‘‘Spoleto’’
(1972) departs sharply from her us-
ual canvases by its blunt, non-poetic
colors. Gone is the lyrical, smokey
quality of her previous works. Yet
the work still illustrates her gestural,
emotional style. Replacing the trans-
parent, watery washes of her oil
painting is the pure color technique
that Matisse uses in his cut-outs.

Using the techniques of commer-
cial art, Roy Lichtenstein takes the
everyday and places it into a differ-
ent context in ‘‘Bull I’’ (973). He uses
a method of commercial printmak-
ing and achieves a bold graphic de-
sign. The bull as a symbol of strength
and power is echoed in the bold ver-
tical composition and the powerful
contrast between black and white.

The show’s diversity of prints takes
the viewer from quasi-surrealism to
Abstract Expression to Pop art and
beyond, while exploring the same
medium, the print. The stature of the
exhibiting artists is great and so is
the intricate techniques of their
prints, ranging from linecut to litho-
graph. Du Pont gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and 2

Past comes alive
in ‘stunning: film

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

People often have an almost in-
herent interest in history, and the op-
portunity to see the past alive in the
present is a phenomenon seen every
day in Lancaster County, Pa., the
home of a large settlement of Amish.
The movie “Witness” gives a stun-
ning, if somewhat inaccurate, por-
trayal of these “‘plain people.”’ It has
suspense, humor, a love story, and in
each of these respects, it satisfies the
audience.

Who are these people who refuse to
take on the trappings of ‘‘modern-
day”’ life, who refuse to fight in their
own defense or in a war, and who
scorn the many tourists who come to
see their way of life? Through
“Witness,’’ we find out they are a
proud, strong, deeply religious peo-
ple.

It is the very simplicity of their
lives that not only sets them apart
from ‘“‘the real world,” but that also
makes them so very appealing. As
the hero learns, the Amish are not
simply ‘‘quaint.”’

Director Peter Weir’s film begins
with the recently widowed Amish
woman Rachel and her small son,
Samuel, setting out into the world of
the ‘“‘English.”” While waiting for a
delayed train in Philadelphia,
Samuel witnesses a murder. The
police detective assigned to the case
is Captain John Book (Harrison
Ford), and it is his experiences with
the Amish community that make up
the bulk of ‘‘Witness.”’

Weir’s camera works magic as it
plays over the acres of grain in the

Amish fields. There is colors and mo- *
tion. There are moments of light and _,
darkness. There is a great sense of
pacing in this film. When the action «
slows down, it slows for a purpose:
As Book adjusts to a radical change
in the pace of life, we adjust to a «
change of pace in the film as well. |
And there are silent moments, during
which not a word is said, but during +
which we learn as much as in any of |
the moments with dialog.

Still, these silent moments would '
mean nothing without exceptional -
performances, and the entire cast,
especially Ford and Kelly McGillis *
(Rachel), give just such perfor- ,
mances,

McGillis is stunning. As Rachel,
she is in love with a man she can‘
never have, caught between this man |
she loves and her native culture.
Ford, too, is outstanding. He is in his«
meatiest role yet, and he digs right,
in. He is tough yet gentle; he seems
in control yet caught up in something
beyond his control; he has strong,
convictions, tempered with a light:
sense of humor.

“Witness” is one of many late-,
winter releases now flooding theaters
across the country, and it is one well*
worth seeing. Some Amish have ask-,
ed that the movie be boycotted
because of technical inaccuracies’
and the exploitation of their culture,
in this picture. (In both of its first two
weeks, however, ‘‘Witness’’ was the‘
second-highest grossing film in the,
country.) ‘‘Witness”’ is, nonetheless,
a fine film that serves to add ap-
preciation of the Amish rather than,
to exploit them, and I recommend it
strongly.

Don’t be hauled in.

“Night Patrol’’ is a poor excuse for
making a movie. It is a comedy with
weak, dumb, nonsensical humor. I
had the feeling this was supposed to
be a movie in the same genre as
“‘Airplane!’’, but compared with that
classic, this dud is a real bomb.

The plot is quite simple. Melvin
(Murray Langston) is a policeman
with a double identity. In his alter
ego he is The Unknown Comic; you
remember him: the bag-headed com-
ic who made a quick rise to stardom
a few years ago (then disappeared
almost without a trace). Well, the
trouble comes when another bag-
headed jokester goes around robbing
nightclubs, thus implicating Melvin.

Along the way, the audience watch-
es stints of voyeurism, gross-out
gags, a midget police captain who
can’t control his gastric expulsions
and countless other worn-out and/or
tasteless jokes. In fact, there were
only three really good laughs in the
entire movie, and one of these came
while the outtakes were being shown

behind the credits at the end.. ‘

The acting was as poor as the
jokes. Although there were somé
familiar faces on screen, none seemr
ed to get into the spirit of the movie.
One bright spot was the co-starring
role of Pat Paulsen, who hasn’t made
any appearances for quite some
time. Unfortunately, his laid-back,
quiet style didn’t fit with his
character’s playboy wenching.

From a visual standpoint, “Night
Patrol’ looked old, almost as if the
picture had been made at the height
of The Unknown Comic’s popularity
and let sit for release until now. The
sound was also bad and, at times,
thankfully so.

After only 20 minutes or so, ‘I
wanted to get up and leave, but J
stayed, hoping something funny
would happen. I was, however, disap-
pointed, and the only honest recom,
mendation I could give, therefore, is
not to be hauled in by the “Nig
Patrol.”

The Natural Bridge Hotel still has
some rooms available for the week-
end, said Winston Tolley, general

manager, but is more full than usual
because of Fancy Dress.

In addition, the hotel’s restaurant
has a special buffet Saturday night
that attracted about 300 people last
year, he said.

“It does have a good effect on busi-
ness,” Tolley added.

‘You fill up, and that’s about the
most you can do,’’ said the Keydet-
General’s Holland. ‘‘We love this.
We'd like for every day to be this
