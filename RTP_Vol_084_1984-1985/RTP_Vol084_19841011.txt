Homecoming

Concert is
first event
at pavilion

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

 

A concert by the Spinners tomor-
row night kicks off W&L’s Homecom-
ing Weekend and signals the opening
of the student activities pavilion, and
a full schedule of Homecoming ac-
tivities is planned through Sunday
afternoon.

Events sponsored by the Student
Activities Board, the Alumni Asso-
ciation and the Class of 1986 will pro-
vide a backdrop for the Generals’
football game against Hampden-Syd-
ney College Saturday afternoon and
the soccer match with Gettysburg
College that morning.

Friday’s activities begin at 5 p.m.
with an alumni reception for the
Homecoming Queen and her court at
the Alumni House and continue with
a $15,000 show by the SAB in the new
pavilion, located behind Lewis Hall.
Shor Patrol will open the concert at
8:30 p.m. and will be followed on
stage by the Motown group the Spin-
ners.

Tickets for the pavilion show are $5
in advance or $6 at the door.

A main objective of the concert will
be to familiarize students with the
new pavilion, according to John Hay-
wood, SAB entertainment director.

“The success of this concert will
have a bearing on the other kinds of
concerts we have in the new pavi-
lion,”’ he said. ‘‘The SAB wants to br-
ing concerts to the students, but we
have to have their support to make
them go.”’

The SAB will have the job this
year, Haywood added, of changing
attitudes. ‘‘The average mink wants
three bands and all the beer he can
drink for three bucks,” he said. ‘“‘We
want to provide big name entertain-
ment where the focus of the concert
is the group and not the beer.”’

SAB members at the pavilion will
direct traffic, said Haywood, adding
that students should plan to car pool
because of limited parking near the
pavilion. Eventually, a 300-car park-
ing lot will be constructed at the
pavilion site,

Saturday's events lead off with the
soccer game at 10 a.m. on Wilson
Field. Afterward, the Alumni Asso-
ciation and the SAB will sponsor the
third pre-football game party and
picnic on the lacrosse practice field
near Liberty Hall.

Alumni Association Executive Sec-
retary Richard B. Sessoms said the
annual alumni picnic lunch will be in-
corporated into the ‘‘tailgate’’ party
this year. Also planned, he said, is a
jazz band on the field, beginning at
11:30.

OPINION
Honor reconsidered

Last week, a story on the front page of The Ring-tum Phi told
the plight of a University of Virginia second-year
undergraduate who had been convicted of an honor violation.
People at U.Va. hailed the verdict as one upholding the fine
Honor Code that governs student affairs.

 

Two weeks ago, another front-page story more loosely
related to honor also appeared on the front page of The Phi.
Rush violations and violators had not been reported as diligent-
ly during Rush as some had expected. Friends were reluctant
to turn in friends and fraternities were reluctant to turn in their
rivals for sins of which they also were guilty.

So, when I opened up Saturday’s Washington Post, I was both
surprised and astonished to see Jody Powell, press secretary to
President Jimmy Carter, extolling a re-evaluation of the Cadet
Honor Code at the Air Force Academy. Powell, once a cadet at
the academy, had been found guilty of cheating on a history
test in the middle of his senior year and left the acade in
disgrace. Twenty years later, he had decided to visit the cam-
pus he had left in shame.

In the column, Powell professed genuine remorse over the
affair. ‘‘It remains the one mistake, in a lifetime with at least
its share of transgressions, that I most regret — and the one
single incident that taught me most about myself and about
life.”’ But in the 20 years since his departure, the academy has
changed considerably. Women have entered the academy, but
the statement carved over the entrance gate still reads ‘‘Bring
Me Men.” The number and the quality of the applicants since
1964 has risen. Academic pressure has been heightened. To the
surprise of many, the academy weathered well the admittance
of women, although women, by both Powell’s admission and
that of administrators, still face more than their share of
pressure in an already pressure-filled atmosphere.

What bothered Powell the most about the return to Colorado
Springs, however, was the decomposition of the Cadet Honor
Code — ‘‘We will not lie, cheat, steal nor tolerate among us
those who do.”’ For Powell, the ‘“‘heart and soul of the institu-
tion, the principle that I failed to live up to’’ was in trouble. A
cheating scandal last spring showed that many cadets had par-
ticipated in questionable practices. The idea of honor had
deteriorated to such a great extent that it had become apparent
to the superindendent that he had to acknowledge and deal with
the problem. A study is currently underway examining their
Honor Code.

Such a study also is needed here. A parallel can easily be
drawn between the Air Force Academy’s problems and those
we now face at Washington and Lee. With the admission of
women and in the face of an increasing reluctance among
students to report even social infractions, we must confront our
changing view of honor and the ‘‘gentleman.”’ When, as in the
case of last year’s Executive Committee only 21 investigations
were made into alleged honor offenses with two convictions
resulting in expulsions, a serious re-examination of our system
is mandated.

The importance of the Honor System cannot be understated.
At Washington and Lee, it governs far more than our behavior
in the classroom. We are gentlemen — or at least we are sup-
posed to be — both during class and afterwards. There is, some
argue, no boundary to the Honor System. Powell hit on the im-
portance of the honor concept as he reminisced about his col-
lege days. ‘The years I spent there meant more to me than any
other period of my life, and the part that meant most was the
Honor Code that I violated. Though I fell short, thousands of
other young men did not. Their example is a continuing
reminder that human beings are capable of much finer and
better things than we generally suppose.” For Powell, as it
should be for us, the honor code was an integral part of his
education. The challenge it presented then is the same
challenge it presents today — that all of our actions — without
exception — be forthright and honest.

At Washington and Lee, we must confront the same situation
Powell’s school now examines. What is honor to this current
student generation? Do we really believe enough in the system
to report every offense? Are we afraid to report because of the
single sanction clause? Do we still believe, as Powell stated,
that ‘“‘the teaching of a higher standard, a different approach to
life itself, is essential’? Is a standard which all meet really a
standard?

Many people, especially professors, believe we students are
reluctant to turn in honor violations, especially those that are
“‘trivial.”” Perhaps we ought to consider along with the reality
of honor whether a single sanction honor system defeats it own
purpose. Would a multi-sanction honor system work at W&L?
Neighboring schools have met with some success in their
multi-sanction systems. Would we? We think not. As we begin
the transition to coeducation, though, we tread on a natural
breeding ground for consideration of such changes.

Faculty: Teachers or parents?

MY VIEW
By B. Darby Brower

 

 

This year we have experienced a change in the
social life here at W&L because of decisions made
by the Student Affairs Committee of 1983-84. The
changes have been extremely unpopular— as well
as unfair —in the eyes of most students. As the
policies stand now, Wednesday night parties are
limited to the members of the fraternity and their
dates. Members of other fraternities, whether
they are friends of members of the house having
the party, are not allowed to attend. The case is
the same for independents.

This policy, therefore, leaves those students not
affiliated with that fraternity with limited options.
Other fraternities may have their own party or
they can go to the Cockpit. Independents have only
the Cockpit to turn to for student-oriented enter-
tainment. Those are the ground rules and basic
facts of our current Wednesday night social life.

In the past, many fraternities (although not all)
have complained about putting on parties for the
entire campus, which is very often the case when
only a small handful of fraternities have parties on
a Wednesday night. At the same time, the Wednes-
day parties were upsetting to several faculty
members whose class attendance Thursday morn-
ning was either very poor, or many of the students
who did attend were too tired from the night
before to contribute to or pay attention during

class. In addition, the administration was upset by
the deterioration of many houses because of the
numerous large parties.

In response to all of those inputs, the SAC made
the decision to limit individual parties to members
and dates only.

The first of many problems with that policy is
that if the members of a fraternity want to party
on Wednesday night, then they must do so in their
own house. That only creates a more constant
wear on each house, which is supposed to be a pro-
blem the administration wanted to alleviate.
Before, when two houses could go together on a
party, at least only one house took the abuse.

The next problem is that independents can only
go to the Cockpit. What if the student does not like
the blaring music, or what if there is simply no
room in the Cockpit as is often the case?

The worst part of the new policy though, is that
it limits us to when we may party with our friends.
It further separates the students during the week
at a time when so many of us enjoyed spending
time with other fraternity members and indepen-
dent friends either at our own house or at the
houses of others. In years past, most of us felt free
to wander to another house and drink a beer with
friends and talk with them in a setting outside of
the classroom.

Many faculty members say that socializing can
be accomplished during the weekend. But why
can’t we have a choice? I don’t feel it is right that I
should be expected to tell friends of mine, many of
whom have ben coming to our Wednesday parties
for the past three years, that they cannot come in-
to my house to talk and havea beer.

I realize that some of the faculty are sincere in

their concern for our academic performance while
we are here at W&L, but all students need a break
during the week to relax and stop thinking about
the books for a few hours. As a college student, I
feel that we should have the right to choose for
ourselves what we shall do when we can afford a
break and with whom we shall spend that time.

We are old enough to take the responsibility of
our academics, and even for those among us who
are not yet so responsible, will learn from their
mistakes. This includes knowing when you have
time to drink. If all of these decisions and respon-
sibilities are taken away from us, then we do not
benefit as much from a decision-making process
which should be ours in the first place. When are
we supposed to learn responsibility? Isn’t college
supposed to help prepare us for life?

Again, I stress that I seriously believe that the
faculty is truly concerned about our academic
achievements, but I feel that a vital part of every
man’s growth involves learning to answer for
himself through his display of responsibility.

It goes along with the spirit and reputation of
Washington and Lee that we are not only students,
but that we are also a part of a very unique and
special community. This community includes not
only our close friends and fellow students, but also
the faculty. The new policies partially cripple that
community spirit, in that it causes students to
have to act rudely toward one another, and makes
many students feel as though the faculty and ad-
ministration are against them or don’t have faith
in their judgment.

We all benefit much more from each other when
relations are not hindered. Allow students to
choose their own fates.

 

 

 

GREAT NEWS

 

Coed decision criticized

Editors’ Note: The following was dated
Saturday, July 14, 1984.

To the Editors:

A few hours ago I learned of the
trustees’ decision to change 235 years
of tradition at Washington and Lee
University by voting 17 to 7 in favor
of collegiate coeducation. I mourn
this decision ae I would mourn the
death of a close personal friend. The
character of Washington and Lee has
for me been a living force, its stu-
dents, faculty and alumni. The sing-
ular qualities of W&L — its size, its
notion of ‘‘work hard, play hard,’’ the
special cachet of its ‘‘gentlemen’’ —
created an academic environment
that has profoundly influenced me.
The W&L experience helped define
this young man’s goals and relation-
ships, and helped make me what it is
that I am today. In a world fraught
with inconstancy and and disquieting
bias toward a state of inert uniformi-
ty, the University’s unique aura and
traditions have provided for me a
real touchstone, as well as a sense of
continuity with my youth.

The sense of loss I now feel is ac-
companied by a sense of frustration,
and even anger. How did it come to
pass that the trustees could ignore
the 2-1 margin against coeducation in
the alumni poll and the similar mar-
gin in the student survey? Is not the
University a democratic community
of persons beyond the administration
and faculty? Why has it been that
new trustee ballots never included
the nominees’ views on important

issues such as coeducation? Indeed,
were the announced results of to-
day’s trustee vote the same as any
first balloting, and was the deck
stacked in this issue? Why did coed-
ucation suddenly become so vital to
the University’s viability, while I, as
a loyal and supportive alumnus,
learned nothing of its contemplation
until a few short months ago when
the November alumni magazine was
delivered (many weeks late, in my
case)? Furthermore, I question the
timing of the very consideration of
coeducation under the auspices of a
new president with less than two
year’s association with a heritage as
old and deep as W&L’s. How can it be
that the school is proclaimed to be at
“grave risk’ demographically when
it fails to capitalize on offers of time
and experience to assist in the pur-
suit of qualified applicants (in addi-
tion to solicitations for annual checks
and estate considerations)? Indeed,
can it be that today’s trustee vote for
coeducation is irrevocable? I feel, as
part of the W&L community’ that
many questions surrounding today’s
events should be addressed in a man-
ner completely dissimilar to the fait
accompli of coeducation.

I have and will continue to believe
that the all-men’s collegiate alter-
native is viable and valuable in
American education, and important-
ly, that this option worked at W&L.
To me, the purpose of Washington
and Lee has been to instill the ideal of
pragmatic, ethical achievement in
the University’s students. This ideal,

within the unique framework and
history of the school, translated into
the sound preparation of W&L men
for their professional and social
futures. The University I have known
fulfilled ite mission, and I truly
believe its graduates — relative to
their peers — to be both successful
and content in their lives. Unfor-
tunately, I sincerely question the
ability of the school to maintain its
traditions and the essence of its col-
legiate experience in a coed environ-
ment. There truly is a critical mass
at W&L — its 1,350 students are not
Princeton or Dartmouth or Williams
or Virginia — that supports its
“academic village,’’ its fraternities
and athletics (I personally will miss
the excitement of W&L’s national la-
crosse presence), its relations with
its neighboring schools and its other
infra-institutions. And, very impor-
tantly, I question whether a universi-
ty the size of W&L can afford the fi-
nancial disaffection of any part of its
alumni.

Sadly, I feel that a friend I knew
and supported well is passing on.
Perhaps a polite relationship with the
changed school will evolve, perhaps
not, but the W&L of 1985 will never
replace or realize the devotion and
sense of identification that I feel for
the Washington and Lee of 1749 to
1984. My memory of what has been
and my sense of what ought to be
lives on — Rest In Peace, old friend.

Not funny

To the Editors:

The front page article of the Oct. 4
issue of your publication entitled,
“Yes, wouldn’t it be funny if...”
displays a wanton disregard for
sound journalistic style in our cam:
pus newspaper.

The last hope for the continued
healthy life of liberal thought on our.
campus is embodied in the You
Democrats. Such blatant disrega.
for the policies discussed at Y.
meetings is nothing less than a
disservice to the organization involv-
ed and to journalistic excellence.

To our best knowledge and to that
of the Young Democrats and College
Republicans involved, no such
meeting was ever held at which the
topic of endorsing President Reagan
was considered. Furthermore, I (Jim
Murphy) deny ever having uttered
the words which you so generously
attribute to me (leak?) and have no
knowledge whatsoever of anyone in
my organization confusing Bozo and
Bonzo,

Yes, wouldn’t it be funny if...‘“The
Phi got the facts straight?”

Young Democrats

and

Patrick Hayden, Chairman
College Republicans

Corrections

Jim Murphy, president of the
Young Democrats, said he was
quoted in error in a statement attri-
buted to him on page 1 of the Oct. 4
Ring-tum Phi. The item was face-
tious in tone, but the quotation at-
tributed to Murphy was drawn from
a reporter’s news account of the en-
dorsement matter. The editors
believed the quotation was accurate
when they wrote the item and
apologize for the error.

The Phi Kappa Sigma house
was warned only once, not seven
or eight times, as was reported in
the Sept. 27 issue of The Ring-tum
Phi, to reduce the level of noise
during a Sept. 15 party. Fraternity
President Jim Cobb said the
police worked with the fraternity
and the band to reduce the noise to
an “acceptable level” and that
seven or eight noise levels were
tried before an acceptable one
was reached.

Today we have a brand new race,” exclaim-
Nalter Mondale on Monday in reference to
Sunday debate. with President Reagan.
Tuesday’ s Washington Post described a jubi-
it Mondale, whose pollster, Peter Hart, after
_ tartviewing 600 viewers had found Mondale the
" nnier by a margin of 52 percent to 32 percent.
ther polls described by the newspaper show-
«a Wide Mondale lead, such as the CBS News-
New. York Times Poll, in which Mondale was
pickéd the winner over Reagan by 43 to 34 per-
cept. Others, such as an ABC News poll, showed
Mondale a victor by a narrow margin, 39 to 38
percent.
ialford Ryan, associate professor of speech at
W ashington and Lee and author of a book about
presidential rhetoric, noted significant dif-
ferenees between the candidates. He analyzed
the candidates in terms of what he called the
aracteristics necessary for good presentation:
Ability, trustworthiness, sociability, com-
sure, dynamism and outgoingness.
a:terms of credibility and trustworthiness,
an said Reagan ‘‘appeared to be more credi-
‘because he cited more statistics, more
2ts.,. He seemed to have those things at his

gertips.””

Ryan said that Mondale, on the other hand,
“seemed to rely on more emotional responses.”

However, Ryan added that Mondale’s asser-
tion at the end of the debate that the voters ‘‘still
did not know what Reagan’s tax proposal’’ was
undermined much of Reagan’s credibility and
trustworthiness.

In terms of sociability and composure, Ryan
determined that ‘‘overall, Mondale appeared to
be more composed than Reagan. Mondale
addressed the camera almost immediately after
the question.”’

“Reagan seemed to have to compose himself,
literally, before he answered some of the ques-
tions and appeared internally ill-composed bet-
ween some questions and tried to phrase his
answers,”’ the professor said.

“Reagan wasn’t up to his usual casual style,”’
Ryan noted. Mondale, he said, was more effec-
tive in portraying sociability. The professor said
Mondale was the more dynamic of the two.

“‘Mondale had a lot more gestures,” he noted.
“‘He appears to be a caring, concerned, decent
person. It was very clear that Mondale opened
up to the American people.”

Reagan, according to Ryan, was far less ex-
troverted and dynamic, and much more reserv-
ed, except when he spoke of values and patri-
otism.

Ryan described Reagan’s general speech pos-

ture as defensive. ‘Reagan looks very good
when he has a prepared script, when he has his
teleprompter in front of him,” he said. ‘‘When he
has his notes in front of him, he looks very good.”’

‘He is able to deliver the lines,’’ he continued.
“He is, after all, an actor. He’s very good at de-
livering those lines.’’

‘Ronald Reagan was really not up to his fluid
delivery,’’ he added. ‘‘There were lots of halts,
lots of pauses. That is not his usual delivery.”

Describing the candidates’ emotional appeals,
Ryan said, “It seems as if Reagan looked to the
past, and at best looked at the present. (He)
reiterated his old values, trickle-down theory,
‘what’s good with America.’ ”

Ryan said Mondale looked more to the future,
which he is in a better position to do as a chal-
lenger to the incumbent.

Finally, Ryan judged the logical appeal of the
two candidates. He said the quote that Reagan
used, ‘‘I’m running on my record, while Mondale
is running away from his,”’ will weigh heavily in
the minds of voters.

However, Mondale’s humorous quote by Will
Rogers, ‘‘It’s not what he doesn’t know that
bothers me, it’s what he knows for sure that just
ain’t so,” served a two-fold purpose. It had logi-
cal appeal, while at the same time it undermined
some of Reagan’s trustworthiness, according to
Ryan.

utual Broadcasting Network of-
2d WLUR-FM a satellite dish to
eive Mutual programs aired by

station, but university staff
nbers say the school likely will
accept the proposal for aesthetic
ons.

1 Similar offer by The Associated
2ss has been accepted.

due to the recent AT&T breakup,
ny broadcasters have found it less
ensive in the long run to install
zllite dishes and black boxes on
subscribers’ properties than to
itinue sending signals over phone
S,

.ccording to Frank Parsons, exec-
ve assistant to the president, the
4 proposed by Mutual would be
“ut as large as the dish now on the

of the University Library. That
‘is 4.6 meters in diameter.

he Mutual dish would be used to
adcast the Texaco Metropolitan
ra Series, to which WLUR, the
apus radio station, subscribes.
site plan presented by the de-
iment called for the dish to be
ed on the roof of the library.

arsons said the dish currently on
library roof had been placed to
se as little aesthetic damage as
‘ible. A second dish would likely
art from the beauty of the cam-
, and would also weaken the roof
‘cturally. Parsons sees no pro-
a,with the AP dish, which should
glaced on the roof of Reid Hall
.t the end of the calendar year.

During the 1983-84 school year,
rsens said he told Professor Ron-
‘MacDonald, then chairman of the
irnalism department, that, if ask-
he would recommend to Presi-

dent Wilson that the university not
obtain the Mutual dish.

Both Parsons and WLUR officials
said the Texaco Metropolitan Opera
Series could be received with the dish
presently in place on top of the
library. WLUR broadcasts the opera
for 12 consecutive Saturdays begin-
ning in December. Mutual will pro-
vide the boxes necessary for trans-
mission, and by pointing the library
dish at the opera satellite, WLUR will
be able to receive the Met signal.

WLUR has opera broadcasting sch-
eduled from noon to 6 p.m. for the 12
Saturdays, although classics co-di-
rector Bart Smith said the average
broadcast lasts about three hours.
WLUR originally received the Metro-
politan series over telephone lines,
and in recent years has picked up and
rebroadcast the signal from WVTF in
Blacksburg.

David Brittigan of the University
Library’s media center said the dish
can only look at one satellite at a
time. ‘We pick up all the movie chan-
nels...from a satellite,’ he added.
The only programming that will not
be available during opera broadcasts
will be the movie channels because
all other cable broadcasts come from
Lexington Cable Co.

The Mutual satellite will only carry
the opera, but has the potential to
carry additional programming at a
later date.

According to Parsons, The Amer-
ican Bar Association also has ap-
proached W&L about a satellite dish.
The: ABA apparently is anxious to
place a satellite dish somewhere in
western Virginia, although Parsons
believes some site other than the
W&L campus will be chosen.

“‘We would have to examine very
carefully our ability to hold another
antenna,”’ he said.

In a “very harmonious’’ vote, the
Washington and Lee University
faculty approved 55-minute classes
Monday as the only change in next
year’s academic calendar, according
to Dean of College John W. Elrod.

Beginning next fall, classes will
run from 8 a.m. to 5:55 p.m. The rea-
son for lengthening classes from 50 to
55 minutes is that classes starting on
the hour will simplify scheduling.

According to Elrod, the faculty
‘reaffirmed its commitment to the
12-12-6”’ calendar. ‘‘There was one
dissenting vote representing the C-
School.” he added.

The faculty also ‘‘voted very
strongly in favor of retaining three
registration periods’’ and ‘‘very
solidly” in favor of retaining
Thanksgiving break, explained the
dean,

Alcoholism

Father Joseph C. Martin, one of the
country’s leading educators on the
‘disease of alcoholism,” will present
a program titled ‘Chalk Talk’ on
Alcohol” at Washington and Lee
Tuesday at 8 p.m. in Warner Center.

Father Martin’s appearance at
W&L is being sponsored by the Stu-
dent Health Committee and funded
by W&L’s Baur Alcohol Awareness
Program.

An ordained Catholic priest from
Baltimore, Father Martin taught in
seminaries for 22 years before begin-
ning work as an educator in the field
of alcoholism in 1970. Since then he
has lectured throughout the United
States and also in Great Britain,
Europe and the Far East.

In February 1972, the U.S. Navy
made a film of Father Martin’s
“Chalk Talk on Alcohol.” That film
has become a classic in alcohol treat-

committee chairman John H. Wise
presented his committee’s report.
The Committee on Registration and
Schedules then reported, as did the
faculty Executive Committee.

“The recommendations that were
voted on were proposed by the EC,”
Elrod said. The faculty approved all
of the EC’s recommendations, which
included Sept. 2 as the first day of
freshman orientation next year.

The calendar committee’s reports,
which did not mention an opening
date for orientation, recommended
that Thanksgiving vacation be re-
placed with a break in October. It
also called for reduction of the
amount of paperwork and time in-
volved in registration, possibly
through a one-time-per-year
registration period.

Although the calendar committee’s
study resulted in only one change,
both Wise and Dean of Students
Lewis G. John say they believe the
committee did accomplish its mis-
sion.

Professor Halford Ryan

“‘We were appointed last fall and
worked until the springtime,” said
Wise. ‘‘The committee accomplished
the study.”’

“T don’t think you need a major
change, necessarily, to accomplish
something,’ John said. ‘Both stu-
dent and faculty opinion has been ex-
pressed. There’s been a close exam-
ination of the 12-12-6,”’ he said.

According to Elrod, the only real
debate was over the 12-12-6 format.
“A number of departments seem to
be struggling with this system,”
Elrod said.

Citing the physics department as
an example, Elrod explained that
some professors would like more
time to present the same amount of
material. Physics 105 and 106, lasting
a total of 24 weeks, have been length-
ened to a 30-week series of three
courses covering the same material.

Literature prize
announced today

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)
—Poet Jaroslav Seifert, a long-time
Czechoslovak dissident, at 83 today
became his country’s first winner of
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

The 18-member Swedish Academy
of Letters cited Seifert, unheralded
and little-known outside his country
and Central Europe, ‘‘for his poetry
which, endowed with freshness, sen-
suality and rich inventiveness, pro-
vides a liberating image of the in-
domitable spirit and versatility of
man.”’

The prize for literature was the
first to be awarded in this year’s
series of Nobel Prizes. Last year, the
literature prize went to Briton Wil-
liam Golding, author of ‘Lord of the
Flies.”

The Norwegian Nobel Commitee
selected the Nobel Peace Prize win-
ner, and it will announce its choice
Oct. 16. Jakob Sverdrup, the commit-
tee’s secretary, said the committee
accepted a record 83 nominations for
the peace prize. Last year, the peace
prize was awarded to Lech Walesa, a
founder of Poland’s outlawed Soli-
darity labor union.

Each 1984 prize carries a record
cash stipend of 1.65 million Swedish
kronor, about $195,000.

The Generals football team takes
on rival Hampden-Sydney in the final
meeting between the two as all-male
schools.

Saturday evening a banquet is be-
ing held in Evans Dining Hall for the
1934 Generals football team, a team
that sported a 7-3 record and won
both the state and Southern Confer-
ence championships. Returning for
the 50th year reunion are 15 of the
surviving 21 players from the 33-
member team, Sessoms said. No or-
ganized student functions are plann-
ed.

Sunday afternoon marks the first
of the class parties for the school
year, and is sponsored by the Class of

1986. Two bands, Eight to the Bar and
the SpongeTones, are scheduled to
play at the pavilion from 1:30 until 6
p.m.

Admission will be $4 to the general
public and free to students with class
passes.

Junior class President Townes
Pressler said, ‘‘We expect a fantastic
party in the new pavilion. This will
just be an example of what class par-
ties will be like.’’ He added that this
is only the first of four parties for
which class passes can be used for
admission.

After the Homecoming festivities,
the pavilion will lay dormant until
Nov. 30, when the SAB is planning a

Pavilion ‘fun facts’ abound

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Here are some fun facts about the
new pavilion to know and tell your
friends:

The new student activities pavilion
has a floor space measuring 125'2
feet long and 70 feet wide. The max-
imum legal capacity for the building
is 1255 warm bodies. That means that
for every person there are seven
square feet of space that you don’t
have to share with anyone else. So if

somebody tries to invade your space
Friday, tell them they are violating
the legal limit and to move into their
own space, unless of course you don’t
want them to move.

The stage of the pavilion is 25 feet
long and 70 feet wide (meaning of
course that it spans the entire length
of the interior structure). Another
big bonus: it’s raised three feet
above the rest of the interior floor so
everybody in the place gets a good
view of the band. (Unless of course
someone is violating your seven

Has weekend lost
some grandeur?

By MARSHALL BOSWELL
Staff Reporter

My, how times have changed...

This weekend, in case you haven't
heard (which oddly enough just
might be the case) is Homecoming
Weekend. That means a big game, a
big dance and a queen. Or used to,
anyway.

These days, however, Homecom-
ing barely elicits a raised eyebrow.
Sadly enough, this might come as a
surprise — and a disappointment —to
an illustrious group of visitors who
will attend the event this year.

The group in question is the 1934
General football squad, which is re-
turning for its 50th Homecoming An-
niversary. This marks the first year
that Washington and Lee will host
Homecoming in honor of a certain
class. From now on the class that
graduated from the university 50
years before will be invited to attend
the event.

The homecoming that these alumni
will witness this year, however, is a
far cry from the bash they threw in
1934. The football team was Southern
Conference champions that year, and
excitement for the game was at a
fever pitch.

The Generals played Virginia Tech
— a strong local foe — and handily
had “the Gobblers”’ for dinner, 13-7.

OORDLIIDDEIL aS LIL END rN hd med ha

Homecoming week was sandwiched
between contests against, believe it
or not, Princeton and Navy.

The Ring-tum Phi for Oct. 26, 1934,
proclaimed Homecoming the year’s
biggest weekend. Both Virginia sena-
tors were expected to attend, as were
20,000 visitors, alumni and fans.

This year, the football game
against Hampden-Sydney cannot
boast anywhere near the prestige
that the Tech game did. The Gene-
rals have not played ‘Big League
Football” since 1953.

Is that, though, the only reason
Homecoming has lost some of its
grandeur?

Frank Parsons. assistant to the
president, said ‘It never really had
any grandeur.”’

He said part of the problem with
having a successful Homecoming is
that only 25 percent of the school’s
alumni live in the Virginia area.

Furthermore, a couple of tradi-
tions that formerly marked Home-
coming as a special weekend have
been abandoned. Years ago, there
was a freshman pep rally, as well as
a torchlight parade before the “Big
Game.” The parade was stopped, he
said, for safety reasons.

Secondly, fraternities traditionally
decorated their houses for a contest,
but that custom died out in the late

1960s because of lack of interest.
Besides, Parsons said, the contests
were turning into “‘gross-out mat-
ches. The townspeople began com-
plaining about the obsenity factor.”

square feet of space. )

The ceiling is 24 feet high at the
sides and slopes up to 40 feet at the
center.

Besides the main floor area, there
are also a number of side rooms on
the right-hand side of the pavilion.
Some of the more mundane uses for
these rooms will be an office for the
Student Activities Board, storage for
both the SAB and the Athletic
Department, and two dressing rooms
with attached bathrooms.

More importantly, one room has a
pass-through built in, making it a
very nice bar area. Of course, no
structure built with the consumption
of beer in mind would be complete
without bathrooms. The men’s facil-
ities include three large trough
urinals provided for your privacy
and four enclosed commodes. There
are also three sinks with mirrors for
checking your coif. The young wo-
men have six different commodes to
choose from plus they get an addi-
tional sink and mirror for personal
grooming chores. By the way, both
bathrooms have exits going back into
the pavilion and outside to the gravel
area and the pine forest.

Some people may still be wonder-
ing where the pavilion is exactly
located. Well, if you couldn’t tell
from the photo on the front page,
here’s the scoop. The pavilion is
located behind the law school in an
area known as the “pine forest”
(perhaps because of all the trees
around the place).

Anyway, you drive past Woods
Creek and Lewis Hall and you keep
going past the parking lot. As you roll
on further down the road, your eyes
shall soon behold a humongous struc-
ture of green tin nestled snuggly into
the pine forest. This, my friends, is
the student activities pavilion.

OK, so now you've found the place.
Next question: where the heck do I
park my car? Well, that’s a good one.
The parking lot that is being built for
the pavilion is still under construc-
tion, so that leaves you a few options.
First, you can get there really early
and find a place in the law school
parking lot. Those will go quickly, so
don’t count on them. One quick note
before I go on: Woods Creek types
are advised to walk and not take up
the closer spaces that would be ore
convenient for those comi «, «rom
further away. Besides, the walk will
do you all good.

The next best area to park is in the
upper athletic fields by Liberty Hall.
Here is something important to re-
member if you want to save gas and
money: the exit from Liberty Hall
onto U.S. 60 will be closed to both in-
coming and outgoing traffic. This is a
very dangerous intersection and the
SAB wants to avoid having any accid-
ents. In case you were asleep during
the last couple of sentences, let me
stress that point again. Absolutely no
traffic will be allowed to enter or exit
from U.S. 60. All traffic must go
around the law school. I hope I have
made myself clear on that point.

SAB entertainment director John
Haywood encourages everyone to
carpool out to the pavilion to cut
down on the number of cars in the
area. Here’s a suggestion to the
fraternities: nothing promotes
pledge unity more than a pledge-
sponsored chauffeur service to and
from the pavilion for all interested
brothers.

While the pavilion will be ready for
use this Friday night, it will not be
totally completed. A little work still
remains to be done, and a few finish-
ing touches have to be added to final-
ly make the structure complete.
Among these little additions are
paint on the interior wall of the main
hall and the putting down of the
‘‘Mondoflex”’ floor covering. Sorry,
folks, this weekend we’ll have to par-
ty on concrete floors. We will just
have to wait to party on ‘‘Mondo-
flex.”

Haywood said the pavilion will be
open again for a concert in late Nov-
ember and will be open for a full
schedule of events after the students
return from Christmas break.

In case you were curious about
what happens to the pavilion when
there are no parties being thrown, I'll
fill you in. The athletic department
will have first dibs on the pavilion
during the week. They will use it for
team practice during inclement
weather and will also use the indoor
tennis court (I didn’t mention that
there will be an indoor tennis court in
the pavilion, did I?). Scott Beebe,
assistant superintendent of buildings
and grounds, said that student
organizations are already waiting in
line to get a chance to use the
pavilion for activities.

We hope that now you, the reader,
can be a more informed and effective
pavilion consumer.

Frats get 70%
of freshmen

8y"BILL MARTIEN
bivgt Reporter

 

A larger number of freshmen par-
ticépated in Rush and accepted bids
this fall than did so last year, accor-
ding to University figures.
‘: Through this week, 265 freshmen,
or: ZO percent of the class, have ac-
cepted bids, whereas last year at this
“time 231, or 63 percent of the class,
-had done so.

The increase can partially be at-
triduted to the low level of Rush par-
.ticipation last year.

“Traditionally, 95 percent of an in-
corfiing freshmen class would sign up
fer,open houses,”’ said Dan N. Mur-
phy, associate dean of students for

‘frafernity affairs. ‘‘Last year, 90 per-
cen} of the freshman class partici-
-octed. This year, the percentage was
back up at95.”’

There has been some talk on cam-
pus about houses giving out “‘blan-
ket” bids to increase their member-

|ship. That was said to be partly in
response to the relatively poor level
‘of. dpen house sign-up last year and
partly in anticipation of the lower
number of males in the class entering
‘next fall.

All fraternities did not take that

tack, however, and some fraternities
actually gave fewer bids this fall.

Don Wilkinson of Sigma Chi and
Mike Brooks of Sigma Phi Epsilon
both said their houses gave out a few
more bids than last year, and put the
bid level at ‘‘the mid-thirties.”’

Pat O’Connell, president of Phi
Kappa Psi, said that house gave out
about the same number of bids as
last year, as did Beta Theta Pi. Their
president, George Seavey, put the
number at about 34.

Kappa Alpha was one of the houses
bidding fewer freshmen this year, ac-
cording to president Jeff Boswell,
and he said they ‘‘expect to give even
fewer bids next year.”’

Pi Kappa Phi president Ed Buttar-
azzi said they gave 28 bids, a smaller
number than last year. Pete Detlefs
of Lambda Chi Alpha said his house
extended a lower number of bids this
year.

Gray Sanders of Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon said a high acceptance rate
allowed his house to offer fewer bids
this fall than it did last year.

The number of bids given by
houses willing to provide figures
ranged from a low of 25 by Zeta Beta
Tau to a high of 40 given out by a few
fraternities.

EC gets additional
rebuttal in trials

‘By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

ithe Executive Committee will

}iavé a two-minute rebuttal state-
snegt at the end of closed honor trials,
ifa motion passed Monday is approv-
ed again next week.
«<bhe reason for the proposal is to
keep the defense from bringing up a
poirit that the EC could not refute, a
possibility that exists now because
the defense has the last word in the
trial, said Secretary Sam Dalton
arguing for the proposal.

Sophomore representative Andrew
Caruthers, the lone dissenter in the
il-l, vote, protested that the EC
should wait until it is able to judge
the effects of last year’s White Book
revisions before making additional
changes.

“I'd rather see an open trial as it is
befere we tack this on,’’ Caruthers
said.

Last year, the EC voted to allow a
law student who is not already a
member of the EC to help it in open
trials and to add the word ‘‘expelled”’
to tite transcript of a student convict-
ed ip an open trial.

The EC currently ends an open
trial with a five-minute closing state-
meat, followed by the defendant’s
five-minute statement.

Caruthers said if the EC has done
its‘ job throughout the trial it
— need more time to make its
“ease.

“The way I see it, our case should
s@nd up whether or not we have the
‘additional two minutes,”’ he added.

Hammock pointed out that the
additional time could be used only to
address points that had already been
brought up in the trial.

“Anything you use in a closing
statement or rebuttal must have
already been used as evidence,”
Hammock said.

“T think if the EC uses (the addi-
tional time) to rebut new doubts,”
first-year law representative James
Crutchfield said, “it would be
harmless and could be heipful.”’

Hammock added that the change
was fair because the burden of proof
is on the EC and because having the
additional time would give the honor
system the same format as U.S.
courts.

Sophomore and senior represen-
tatives Shayam Menon and Dave
Jonson said students they had talked
to supported the idea.

In other action, the EC gave final
approval to this year’s student body
budget after awarding the Film Soc-
iety an additional $200.

The Film Society had requested
$1,500 and received $1,000, $200 less
than it received last year.

Sophomore Jim Foley, the socie-
ty’s representative at the EC meet-
ing, reported that about $500 was
donated to the Film Society at last
weekend’s showing of ‘‘My Dinner
with Andre.”

During budget delibertaions two
weeks ago, some members of the EC
suggested that the Film Society
charge admission to its movies, but
Foley pointed out Monday night that
the films can be rented cheaper if ad-
mission is not charged.

Preparation helps W&L
meet stiff competition

of larger debate teams

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

Although not a highly publicized
organization, the Washington and
Lee debate team, which hosted a
tournament last weekend, has been
anactive part of the W&L scene since
the early 1960s.

Although similar to athletics be-
cause it is an organization engaging
in team competition with other col-
leges, debate also stresses academic
prowess necessary for preparation
and competition.

Before competition begins, teams
are given topics for the debate. One
team argues the affirmative and the
other the negative side of the issue.
Certain points are made by each
team, and it is up to the other team to
respond.

‘Preparation,’ said junior Chris
Lion, ‘‘is very important because you
don’t know what points the other
schools will be running (advoca-
ting).”’

According to Professor Halford
Ryan, coach of the W&L debate
team, “A lot of preparation is
necessary for delivering your case
and as the year evolves you have to
continually update your case.”

The three skill levels for the com-

petition are novice, no experience
necessary to participate; junior var-
sity, some college experience necess-
ary; and varsity, for personal
debates.

As they argue in competition, ‘‘the
debaters are judged on the structure
and analysis of their argument, the
quality and quantity of the evidence
they present and their oral presenta-
tion,’ said Ryan, who frequently
judges the competitions.

The W&L debaters face ‘“‘stiff’’
competition, Ryan said, against
schools that are much larger with
speech departments, speech majors
and coaching staffs.

W&L is in Region III of the national
debate teams, which includes col-
leges in Virginia, Maryland, West
Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and the District of Columbia.

Lion and Rich Graves will repre-
sent W&L in audience-judged de-
bates (400 to 500 people in the au-
diences) at DePaul University and
the University of Illinois later this
year, when they will present the af-
firmative opinion for the topic
“America Deserves Reagan.’’ In a
debate at all-male Wabash College in
Indiana, they will take the negative
side of the topic ‘‘Coed means No-
ed.”’

SAC to revote
on party rule

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

The Student Affairs Committee
will vote today on a motion to recon-
sider the rule prohibiting guests at
Wednesday night fraternity parties,
Executive Committee President Cole
Dawson said at Monday’s EC
meeting.

SAC chairman Lewis John. the
Dean of Students, said Dawson made
the proposal at last Thursday’s
meeting and the motion was tabled
for a week.

The rule, which restricts Wednes-
day parties to members of the frater-
nity giving the party and their dates,
was passed by the SAC last year,

Fines for
filthy frats

In response to community com-
plaints about litter from fraterni-
ty parties, the Interfraternity
Council Tuesday voted a fine of
$50 against houses whose party
trash has not been picked up by 8
a.m. the following morning.

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean
of students for fraternity affairs,
said he will make informal inspec-
tions on days following parties,
and said if he sees a problem area
he will phone the offending house.
If a complaint is registered by a
local resident, however, the fine
will go into effect.

 

 

 

GOP leads

Washington and Lee students
voting in Tuesday’s mock election
favored incumbent Republicans
Ronald Reagan and John Warner
over their Democrataic challengers
for the positions of President and
United States Senator from Virginia.

In addition, Republican challenger
Ray Garland defeated incumbent De-
mocrat Jim Olin for the seat in the
House of Representatives from Vir-
ginia’s Sixth District, which includes
Lexington.

Reagan received 88.5 percent of the
122 votes cast, to Mondale’s 11.5 per-
cent. Warner, a W&L alumnus, de-
feated Democratic challenger Edy-
the Harrison, 86.4 percent to 13.6 per-
cent. Garland won 69.3 percent of the
votes to Olin’s 30.7 percent.

B. Scott Tilley, editor of the
Washington and Lee Political Re-
view, which sponsored the mock elec-

along with several other controver-
sial rules.

Those rules came under criticism
from students two weeks ago, when
the Executive Commitee held a dis-
cussion attended by over 50 students,
as well as by John and other faculty
members of the SAC.

English Professor John Evans,
chairman of last vear’s committee
that recommended most of the
changes, said the SAC was trying to
limit Wednesday night parties be-
cause Thursday morning classes
have ‘‘almost been wrecked’’ by the
parties.

Some of the students at the discus-
sion responded that the rules pro-
mote division between fraternities
and might cause every fraternity to
have a party each Wednesday night,
since a fraternity’s members could
not attend a party otherwise.

Another reason cited for reducing
the size of Wednesday parties was
the complaints received from the
local community about the noise and
trash generated by the parties.

At Monday’s EC meeting, Dawson
read a letter from a local resident
who complained that the beer bottles
and plastic cups that line Lee Ave.
every Sunday morning were an eye-
sore for people walking down the
street toR. E. Lee Episcopal Church.

The letter, given to Dawson by
John, reported that recently the
trash has included drug parapher-
nalia and contraceptive deviccs.

The EC voted to recommend that
the Interfraternity Council hire a
person to pick up trash that accumu-
lates between fraternities after par-
ties.

Coed dorms likely; floors will separate

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

Although no decision regarding
dormitory arrangements for the first
coed freshmen class at Washington
and Lee has been made, Dean Pam-
ela Simpson said the Coeducation
Steering Committee is leaning
toward coed dormitories with men
and women on separate floors.

If this particular plan is accepted,
one floor or section of Graham-Lees,
Gilliam and Davis dormitories would
be reserved for women, Ms. Simpson
said. Women probably would be
housed on the second floors of the
dormitories because security precau-
tions make it unacceptable to house
women on the ground floors, Ms.
Simpson added.

One small housing unit possibly
would be all-female, said Ms. Simp-
son, emphasizing that all the housing
plans for next year are still pre-
liminary.

Ms. Simpson said the question of
whether female undergraduates
would eventually be housed in Baker
Dormitory was undecided. Commit-
tee members are reluctant to force

law students out of Baker, but in
1986-87 housing conditions should be
especially crowded when the second
coed class enters Washington and
Lee a year before a new dormitory is
scheduled to be finished, she explain-
ed.

“That's when the crunch is going to
come. Many sophomore women will
want to live in on-campus housing,”’
Ms. Simpson said.

Generally at Washington and Lee
housing arrangements for men are
set for the first two years because 60
percent of the sophomores move
straight form the freshmen dormitor-
ies into fraternity houses. Only in the
last two years of school do most male
undergraduates begin looking for

housing on their own, Ms. Simpson
said. Consequently, many female
undergraduates probably will expect
that their housing needs will be taken
care of for two years also.

The committee also has discussed
what additional security provisions
will be needed in the freshman dor-
mitories in order to make them safe
for the women Ms. Simpson reported.

“There is a feeling on the commit-
tee that women ought to have a lock-
ed, secure floor. But we don’t want to
impose rules on the women that we
don’t on the men,”’ she said.

Ms. Simpson noted that if everyone
needed to get onto their floor, a stu-
dent would have difficulty visiting a
friend on another floor. At the same
time, however, committee members
do not want unwanted men to roam
the halls of the women’s dormitory
floors.

Ms. Simpson said that in studying
reports from other schools about how
they arranged their housing in the
first years after going coeducational,
she has concluded that problems will
arise no matter which housing plan
the committee selects. The reports
give the committee an idea of what
kind of problems they can anticipate

with different dormitory ar-
rangements, however.
She noted, for example, that

Princeton University originally had
put women in separate dormitories.
However, the women were unhappy
with this arrangement because it

isolated tnem.

Female law students also have
been a tremendous help to the com-
mittee in pointing out small problems
that the University should correct
before the first female
undergraduates arrive, she said.

“W&L is so lucky compared to
other schools that have made the
transition to coeducation. We have
the advantage of having women who
have been here as students,’’ she ad-
ded.

Women law students who spoke to
the committee pointed out that a lack
of privacy at the infirmary might
discourage female undergraduates
from using the health facilities, Ms.
Simpson said. Instead of having to
write your name and ailment on a
roster that everyone can see, as is
currently required, the law students
suggested that a person should be
able to write this information on a
private note.

Ms. Simpson said the law students
also cited problems such as the din-
ing hall menus being filled with too
much’ starchy, heavy foods that
would not appeal to women and the
mirrors in the women’s locker room
in the gymnaisum being so high that
an average-sized women can see only
the top half of her face.

Ms. Simpson said these were all lit-
tle problems that can easily be cor-
rected, but that might have been
overlooked if the law students had
not pointed them out.

Most made snide remarks about it.
Others simply shrugged it off. A
handful even approached it with
frozen blood and a white coun-
tenance. However, the question re-
mains: Why does every wide-eyed
freshman have to endure a swimm-
ing test?

The answer to that is mysteriously
elusive. As is the case with many of
Washington and Lee’s unique char-
acteristics, the ‘‘annual’’ swimming
test appears to be steeped in tradi-
tion. It has endured, certainly, but no
one seems certain how it got started
in the first place.

Astory which frequently circulates
about the swimming test is that the
Doremus family, which donated the
money for the old gym, had a son who
drowned at sea because he refused to
jump from a sinking ship into the
water to try to reach a lifeboat. The
family’s donation, therefore, was
conditional on W&L’s instituting
swimming tests for all students.

“T’ve heard that tale, but I can’t
substantiate it,’’ said William B.
Stearns, a former W&L swimming
coach.

Another story states that a swimm-
ing requirement was written into the
University original charter, but Ath-
letic Director William McHenry
pointed out that there was no pool
when that document was drawn up.

Rupert Latture, a professor emeri-
tus and member of the class of 1915,
said he believed the test arose from
the fact that W&L students used to
drown frequently in the Maury
River. The school had plaques com-
memorating some of these incidents.

However, most of this is primarily
hearsay. The most that can be said in
regard to the test is that it has been
around for a very long time. McHen-
ry, who graduated from W&L in 1954,
said he remembers taking the test.

So, why does the University still re-

quire a swimming test?
“We ieei very strongly that

mystery:

4

student should learn basic 2

techniques,”’ McHenry said.
stated further that the procedure hab
been extremely successful.

To cite an example of the test’s ef.
fectiveness, McHenry last summet
attended an advanced ROTC training
camp at Fort Bragg in North F
lina. A great deal of the training, i
said, was in the water, and those whp

. could not swim were asked to wear

white ribbon around their necks sd:
lifeguard could supervise them closg-
ly. Thirty-one Washington and
students attended the camp, three
whom had been non-swimmers prigy
to attending the university. They hag
no difficulty with the training,
McHenry said. =n

of 17 students.

Of the approximately 360 f rf

who take the test every year, only
about 30 to 35. Of those, two-thirds
simply couldn’t swim and
remaining one-third failed the ex-
amination. :
Before McHenry administers the
test each year, he emphatically asks
that those who cannot swim leave
and not attempt the test. However,
some dorm counselors say that for a
freshman trying to impress his new
classmates, it would be embarassing
to get up and leave. As a result, there
always exists the possibility that’

non-swimmer might attempt . the!

examination when he actually
shouldn’t. Such was the case with &
handful of students this year, accord-
ing to the dorm counselors.

“There is nothing I can really do
about that,’’ McHenry said. ‘They

New computers head plans
integral role for department

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

~ Perhaps it’s appropriate that a pro-
fessor who’s new to Washington and
Lee is heading a department that’s
new to Washington and Lee — com-
puter science.

That department has 43 students
and one professor— Theodore Sjoerd-
sma, who until this year headed the
800-student, 14-professor computer
science department at the University
of Iowa.

Sjoerdsma said this week he sees
his department’s purpose as two-
fold: to supply the needs of prospec-
tive majors and to act as a service to
the rest of the university.

“‘T’d like to have the department be
an integral part of the campus, the
College as we!l as the C-School,”
Sjoerdsma said.

He hopes to add advanced courses
to the curriculum and up to three in-
structors to the department over the
next two years, as well as to intro-

duce students from other disciplines
to the advantages of computers. ,

“The computer enhances many
disciplines,’ Sjoerdsma said, and
when students become aware of
what’s possible, he expects the de-
mand for courses will grow. _

Before they do, though, W&L’s pre-
sent computer system needs to be
enhanced, Sjoerdsma said. He said
he hopes to see some of that accom-
plished during this year so more ad-
vanced courses can be instituted next
year. !

And why does a small, liberal-arts
school need a computer science dé-
partment? 4

“Mainly because computers are
touching you in every part of your
life,” Sjoerdsma replied quickly.
‘*You can’t avoid it,”’

Students of the humanities, espec-
ially, need to learn the benefits gait-
ed by access to computers, he said. y

Sjoerdsma said he is looking for-

¢

d

ward “to taking (the department) _

from almost nothing to somewhere
I'd like to see it be.”’

Something in the Scottish air must
be conducive to young rock and rol-
lers, for lately that land has produced
some of the best bands. The Water-
boys and Aztec Camera have re-
leased second efforts that transcend
pop cliches and have catapulted
them into prominence on the interna-
tional scene.

They are linked in that their
leaders, both young men, are seeking
something beyond the everyday con-
cerns of most young songwriters. As
songwriter and leader of Aztec
Camera, Roddy Frame states in the
title cut, “‘Knife,’’ his search is...

“To understand that heaven,

could be anyplace at all.”

The chief differences in the two
bands are in their sonic approaches
toward achieving this ‘‘understan-
ding.”’

If you like your albums on the epic,
heroic, go-for-broke scale, then The
Waterboys’ ‘“‘A Pagan Place’ is for
you. From the opening acoustic
strumming of ‘‘a church not made
with hands” to the crashing chant of
‘‘a pagan place,’’ The Waterboys, led
by songwriter, producer and lead
singer Mike Scott, steamroll you with
musical sincerity.

Similar sonically to recent bands
like U2 and Big Country (Scotland
again!), The Waterboys opt for a
“‘big’’ sound. Organic instrumenta-
tion, most notably piano and sax-
ophone, is preferred, with repetition
of musical phrases used to reach a
crescendo. Still, the subdued ‘‘the
thrill is gone”’ is as touching an end of
a romance song as anyone’s ever
written.

It is Scott’s vocal prowess that
transforms fairly mundane lyrics in-
toa inystic search:

Pianist to continue
Concert Guild season

‘iat Ae re Ne aR
By BRUIN S. RICHARDSON III
Special to the Phi

 

The Washington and Lee Concert
Guild began its season last Wednes-
day evening with a performance of
the Richmond Sinfonia, a Chamber
orchestra from the larger Richmond
Symphony. In a return to their tradi-
tional place at the head of the Guilds
series, the Sinfonia again proved to
be popular with the crowd; a large
number of both students and mem-
bers of the community attended the
concert.

Playing a program whose flavor
was decidedly in the clean crisp har-
monies of baroque and early classi-
cal, the sinfonia, under the direction
of Jacques Houtmann, began the
evening with Handel’s Water Music
Suite No. 1 in F Major. Following this
familiar number was Mozart’s Sym-
phony No. 15, a piece written when
the composer was but 16.

Following a brief intermission,
Robert Volkmann’s Serenade No. 9
Op. 69, a composition for strings that
featured the Sinfonia’s principal
cellist, provided a reprieve from the
18th century. Although the cellist
played well, the piece was of ques-
tionable value from a compositional
standpoint.

The final selection on the program
was Haydn’s Symphony No. 92 , the
“Oxford.’’ Well played and weli
known, the piece was met with en-
thusiastic applause, which prompted
Mozart’s ‘‘Eine Kleine Nachtmusik”’
as an encore. In a setting that was
very well suited to their size, the
Richmond Sinfonia provided a fine
start to the Guild’s season.

Pianist Dorothy Lewis-Griffith will

Other works included in the con-
cert will be from Debussy, Ravel,

A native of High Point, N.C., Ms.
Lewis-Griffith graduated from the
Juilliard School of Music with the
bachelor’s and master’s degrees in
music and from the Peabody Conser-
vatory of Johns Hopkins University
with a doctor of musical arts de-

grees.

She studied in Paris with a Ful-
bright-Hays grant, first at the Con-
servatoire de Paris and later at the
Ecole Normale de Musique.

While in Europe, she won a prize in
the Geneva International Piano Com-
petition.

She has appeared in numerous solo
recitals at New York’s Town Hall,
the National Gallery in Washington,
the Merkin Concert Hall of the Abra-
ham Goodman House in New York
City and the American Embassy in
Paris.

She has also appeared as a soloist
with orchestras in Rio de Janeiro and
Paris and in the United States with
the North Carolina, Winston-Salem
and Atlanta Symphonies.

She currently is an associate pro-
fessor of piano and related subjects
at Valdosta State College in Georgia.

distill this vision onto viny].

On the surface, Aztec Camera’s
‘Knife’ doesn’t seem as awe-
inspiring as ‘“‘A Pagan Place.’’ The
feel is airier, more open and sonical-
ly less dense. One reason is the re-

guitar to flesh out much of the album.
Frame is in love with melody, and
the album is loaded with hooks.

You can hear strains of Motown,

It was a refreshing change to
see ‘“‘Teachers.”’ This is another
movie set in an urban high school,
but it is more than just another
genre movie. ‘Teachers’ has
been called a comedy, and it is
true that this is a funny film;
‘nonetheless, I can’t consider it a
comedy , rather, it is an entertain-
ing movie with a message.

Nick Nolte plays a social studies
teacher put in the middle of a
legal suit against the school
system by one of his former
students, an illiterate high school
graduate; Jobeth Williams is
another former student, and the
lawyer for the plaintiff in the suit;
and Judd Hirsch is a former
teacher-turned-vice-principal,
now more interested in getting
students through the school than
in educating them. All around
them, you see nearly every
stereotypical character a high
school could have, plus a few
others most schools will never
see. (Richard Mulligan is a stand-
out as an outpatient from the men-
tal hospital who is mistakenly

since the band’s debut, ‘High Land,
Hard Rain,” and with this depth has
come power, yet it has retained its
endearing quality.

Like Mike Scott, Roddy Frame is
concerned with spirituality and
religion, and whether there can be a
place for them in the modern world.
“Knife” and “A Pagan Place”’ are
the logical extensions of this concern,
and it would not be a mistake to say
that these two young men have reali-
zed themselves through their music.

All this is not to say that they are so
“heavy” as to be unlistenable to by
all but the most dedicated. Both
albums are well produced and
eminently listenable, but there is
something more in the grooves than
just ear candy, and repeated listen-

The Waterboys’ “A Pagan Place”’
might just yield up a draft of the Scot-

this ensemble, I couldn’t help feel-
ing that there was too much to
keep track of at times, and I felt
very much like the issue-ducking
principal in the movie.

Most important to this movie,
though, is its message that
students are in school to learn,
and that the school and the
teachers are there for the
students. “Teachers” gets this
across quite well time and time
again. In fact, if there is a major
problem with “Teachers,” it
would be overkill. Just as we are
satiated with high school
stereotypes, we are told over and
over about a teacher’s duty; at
times this borders on the sanc-
timonious.

Still, I recommend ‘‘Teachers”’
quite highly. Don’t expect to laugh
at pure fluff. Much of the humor in
“Teachers” is situational. You
can’t help but think about the
message; then again, you can’t
help but laugh at Richard
Mulligan’s character teach about
Washington crossing’ the
Delaware, either.

weekend, improving its record to
Q 1

‘We did all right. We did what we
had to do,’’: said head coach Page
Remillard concerning the Generals’
ndefeated weekend. W&L scored
over Lynchburg 25-15,
Washington 11-5, and James
Madison 12-3.

Remillard cited Generals Tim
Stanford, who scored 13 goals, and
Bobby Pearson, who scored 15 goals,
for outstanding play last weekend.

lhey are playing really well,” said
Remillard.

ctories

reorge

Remillard noticed improvement in ~

his team’s offense. The improvement
lies mostly in the team’s ability to
score during penalty situations. In
one game, the Generals scored eight
times in nine attempts with the man
advantage’ The eight for nine statis-
tic compares to the 22% that the Gen-
erals shot in penalty situations last
weekend.

Remillard also said that the of-
fense played patiently and read the
defense well, but that the offense still
needs to improve in those areas.

Remillard hopes that the intensity
that his team picked up last weekend
during their win streak carries over
into this coming weekend when the
Generals travel to Brown University
to play in the second half of the Varsi-
ty Invitational. The Generals will
play Army, Harvard and M.L.T.

The Tigers were shut down after

W&L was beaten in 1955, 35-7, and
did not win again until 1960, as the
Tigers, led by Jim Felty and Bill Ben-
son, would outpoint General squads,
led by Bob Funkhouser, Jack Groner
and Clark Lea, by a 3-1 margin.

In the years from 1960-62, W&L won
three straight in the series, as
General teams in those seasons roll-
ed up a record of 25-1-1.

In 1960, W&L went into the Tigers’
Death Valley — so-called because of
the difficulty for visitors to come out
with a victory — and spoiled H-SC’s
Homecoming with a 14-7 win. Charlie
Gummey ran 10 yards and Ned
Hobbs got a 29-yard pass from Doug
Martin to pace the Generals over H-
SC and their new head coach, J.
Stokeley Fulton (Saturday will be the
25th time Fulton has led the Tigers
against W&L).

The 1961 team became the best
small college team in the country and
was featured in Sports Illustrated,
but received their greatest test from
the Tigers, a 7-4 comeback victory.

Johnny McDaniel, who later
became a professor at his alma
mater, was among the team leaders
of the 1962 squad that beat H-SC, 15-6.

From 1963-78, All-Americans like
Whitey Lipscomb, Sid Kirstein, Ed
Kelly and Ray Dodson paced the
Tigers, who won 12 of the 16 games
played.

In recent years, the series has
seesawed, with W&L winning the
games from '79-’81 and H-SC winning
the last two. The most memorable
games were in ’80 when the Generals
scored 17 unanswered points in the
second half to win in front of a

, Parents’ Day crowd and in '81, the

Generals’ ODAC Championship
season, when W&L spoiled another
Tiger Homecoming by winning 7-6.

a turning point for both teams. Both
are coming off big wins, and both
coaches go in with great respect for
their opponents.

“Their defenses have always been
tough against us. We expect them to
be as high as ever against us. There
is always special emotion going
against W&L,’’ H-SC head man
Fulton said.

W&L’s mentor Gary Fallon, who
has seen six previous General-Tiger
tete-a-tetes, concurs with Fulton.
“It’s going to be a real challenge.
They’ve got a lot of people back and
some fine freshmen, but I hope last
week’s win (at Maryville, 24-14) will
be the turning point for this season.”’

Fulton said he was not aware it was
Homecoming Weekend and said that
this would be an added incentive for
W&L. Fallon sees the festive
weekend as a possible deterrent, but
he said he will ask his players ‘‘to
give a good account of yourselves.”’

Whatever the case, the state’s two
bastions of the Southern gentleman
will meet once again to renew their
annual date with history on Saturday
at Wilson Field at 1:30 p.m. There is
little doubt that the 1984 contest will
live up toits storied past.

Wé&L turns

corner

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee football
team broke its three-game losing
streak Saturday when it came from
behind in the fourth quarter to defeat
Maryville, 24-14.

The Generals (2-3) scored two
touchdowns during the last five min-
utes of the game to overcome Mary-
ville’s 14-10 first-half lead.

Maryville scored the game’s first

touchdown in the first quarter when
quarterback Mike Human completed
a long drive by the Scots with a 14-
year touchdown pass to William De-
laney, The Generals were quick to
answer this score as tailback Kevin
Weaver scored the first of his two
touchdowns of the game on a 21-yard
run. After James White added the ex-
tra point, the game was tied at 7-7.
.s Maryville regained the lead early
in the second quarter when Human
found Jeff Silver for a 14-yard touch-
down pass. Human picked apart the
Generals’ secondary during the first
half, completing 12 of 15 passes for
140 yards.

With time running out in the first
half, W&L backup quarterback Jon
Thornton completed a 51-yard pass to
wide receiver Randy Brown that
moved the ball to the Maryville 13-
yard line. On the next play what ap-
peared to be a drive-ending intercep-
tion turned in the Generals’ favor as
Maryville fumbled on the return, set-
ting for a half-ending field goal at-
tempt. White was good on the 30-yard
effort, giving the momentum to the
Generals as the two teams entered
the locker rooms.

W&L dominated the second half as
the Generals’ defense shut down the
Maryville offense, allowing them on-
ly 49 yards offense and two first
downs. On offense, the Generals
moved the ball consistently against
the Scot defense but failed to score

(?),

==beats Scots

any points until late in the game. Two
W&L drives were stopped when the
Maryville defense held the Generals
on fourth-down plays deep in Scot ter-
ritory.

Following a poor punt by Maryville
in the fourth quarter, W&L put to-
gether its game-winning drive. The
Generals converted a fourth-and-one
situation inside the Maryville 10-yard
line to keep the drive alive, and
Weaver scored the go-ahead touch-
down on a 2 yard run with 4:13 re-
maining in the game. After White ad-
ded the extra point, the Generals had
the lead for the first time at 17:14.

The W&L defense stopped Mary-
ville on its next possesion, and the of-
fense again started with good field
position. W&L fullback Frank Sur-
face put the game out of reach. when
he rumbled 40 yards for his first
touchdown of the season with 2:20 re-
maining in the game, giving W&L a
24-14 lead.

The win was the first for the
Generals in Old Dominion Athletic
Conference competition. W&L is now
1-2 in ODAC play.

W&L tailback Gene Girard led the
Generals’ rushing attack with 112
yards on 31 carries. Surface had 92
yards on nine carries. Quarterback
Bobby Wilson was 8-20 for 73 yards
and no interceptions.

The General defense was led by
senior linebacker Kurt Specht who
was in on 18 tackles. Weaver did dou-
ble duty for W&L, scoring two touch-
downs as tailback and getting four
unassisted tackles and seven assists.

“The Maryville win was just what
we needed,’’ W&L head coach Gary
Fallon said. ‘‘We played well in all
departments; but what was most en-
couraging was that we played with
intensity.”

“The defense settled down after
giving up 14 first-quarter points, and
virtually shut down Maryville in the
second half.

while the next four places were taken -

by Generals Ron Moody (26:38), Con-
rad Boyle (26:39), Gordon Ogden

(26:53) and Kevin Kelly (27:10), fol- ™

lowed by the rest of the field.

“We are continuing to improve :

with each meet,’’ Miller said. ‘‘The

important thing to watch for is the -
spread between our first and last fini- °
sher, and that spread is getting :

closer.”’
Only 1:37 separated Frank Pitt-

man and seventh place Mark Pem- .
broke and only 3:07 between Pittman ;
and Kevin Kelly, Washington and :

Lee’s final finisher. It is becoming
very clear how tight this year’s team
is and why they are 6-0.

The individual scoring of the tri- :

meet was Washington and Lee 20-43

over American and 18-45 over Catho- *

lic.

This Saturday the Victory Tour will ;
be at Hampden-Sydney for the Vir- °

ginia State Division II and II] Cham-
pionships. Fourteen men’s teams and
five women’s teams will compete.

“No one will touch Liberty Bap- -
tist,’’ said Coach Jim Angresano of °
Hampden-Sydney. ‘“‘They have won -

the last three years and only lost one
runner from last year.”’

No Old Dominion Athletic Confer- *~

ence team has placed in the top three
in the recent years but Angresano

predicts Washington and Lee will

finish third, behind
Newport College.

Senior midfielder Mark Sullivan builds up a head of steam as he moves up-
field in yesterday’s 3-2 loss against Lynchburg. W&L now stands at 3-1 in the

Soccer splits two
with ODAC foes

By MICHAEL McALLISTER
Staff Reporter

‘The Washington and Lee soccer team
had worked past its slow start and
raced to a 3-0 ODAC mark, but defen-
ding conference champion Lynch-
burg slowed down the machine yes-
terday with a 3-2 victory at Wilson
Field.

W&L now stands at 3-1 in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference and
4-4 overall.

In what Generals’ mentor Rolf
Piranian referred to as ‘‘a key ODAC
game,’’ W&L could not generate any
‘scoring in the first half and the team
was down 3-0 at the half. W&L fought
back in the second half with goals
‘coming from Ken Randby and Billy
Holmes, but the victory was not to be.

Over the weekend, the Generals
traveled to Farmville to take on the
Tigers of Hampden-Sydney. W&L

crushed the Tigers by the wide mar-
gin of 7-0. The Generals were the
beneficiaries of a very unselfish of-
fensive performance, as five dif-
ferent players shared in the goal
scoring. Mark Sullivan and Pete Van
Son had two goals apiece, while John
Templeton, Randby and Gary Cle-
ments had one each

“We are obviously putting things
together,’’ summarized Piranian.
“The Mennonite game (3-2 win last
Wednesday) was a good character
builder because we came back and
won the game after we nearly gave it
away. Against Hampden-Sydney, we
had a great game against a very good
team.”

As part of the Homecoming Week-
end festivities; the Generals will host
Gettysburg at 10 a.m. on Wilson
Field. Piranian calls Gettysburg ‘‘a
big rival’ and expects a good game.

By Mike __ Cinderelia story, but when the going got

Stachura ‘'uUsh, the boys in blue turned eight shades

of green. It was disappointing to see

America’s diamond sweethearts fold like

so many houses of cards, but at the same time it was reassuring to see a
team that really wanted to win, do so.

Ninety percent of the diehard Cub fans had the cork all but popped on the
champagne bottle when the Padres scored six times in the last two at-bats.
Anoccurrence that left, it seems, given the Little League errors made by the
Cubs as the game came to a climax, the darling Windy City 9 in unison with
mouths agape. And that, sports fans, is not the attitude of a winner.

The Cubbies made errors, mental and physical, that put the Hamburger
Team on the road to Detroit. First, Sutcliffe walks the lead-off man in the
bottom of the seventh. Mistake: Jim Frey does not take him out of the game.
Think, Jim. He’s been struggling and there’s no tomorrow. Even if he
weren't, a change of pace couldn’t hurt. It would at least give you a chance to
regroup. Second, a ground ball that my mother could have gloved goes
through first baseman Leon Durham’s iegs. You simply make those plays,
no questions asked. Third, Tony Gwynn hits a screamer at my former (em-
phasis here) franchise player Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg doesn’t make the
play. C’mon, man, when it’s Game 5 of the League Championship Series, you
sacrifice your life to knock down a possible run-scoring hit. If not, you don’t
belong in the World Series. Finally, the Cubbies face Gossage in the eighth
and ninth and not in either inning did the lead-off hitter attempt a bunt. You
got the lead-off man on the night before and you saw what happened. Think.

But no, the Cubs did not think. It brings to mind thoughts of last year’s
Australia’s Cup, where Dennis Conner and the Americans took an early lead
in the final race and then played not to lose rather than to win. The conse-
quences of such a gutless attitude are rather obvious.

When trouble — correction, the challenge— arose, the Cubs ran scared.
Running scared doesn’t cut it. The Padres showed what does, and that’s
meeting adversity head-on with the self-confidence that you will succeed
performing to the best of your abilities.

he real problem for the Cubs was not their opponents’ but the number of
their opponents. Most teams only have one. The Cubs on Sunday had two.
The Padres and themselves....

Ss & 5

...Back down on the Colonnade, there are signs that Homecoming
Weekend will not be as devastating as it looked a few weeks ago. The
Generals, thanks in large part to the tremendous effort of their defense,
came to life in the fourth quarter last Saturday in Tennessee and beat a team
that has a 13-7 win over the uninvited and always obnoxious Squidmongers.
H-SC will unquestionably be up for this contest, but I saw last weekend as a
turning point. A win here would solidify W&L’s direction for the rest of the
season... Cross country is at 6-0 and still counting...

....Let’s talk announcers. First, the best in any game right now is Bob
Kostas with NBC. Keith Jackson is the best college football man ever.
(Watch Saturday’s Texas-Oklahoma fest to see what I mean). And one other
thing, as annoying as Howard is, it was good to hear him in the booth for the
American League Series. He’s grating, kind of like a bad commercial, but
we realize it wouldn’t be half as fun without him, even if we are laughing at
him...

....Finally, something you might have missed at the championship series
and the World Series. The Commissioner, the new guy Peter Ueberroth, is
doing his job. What a difference a year makes. No shots of Bowie in the rain
or cold, It won’t be like a World Series, and isn’t that a relief...
