Minorities

seefl aS

extraneous to Rush

By JOHN WINTERS
Staff Reporter

 

Imagine yourself as Kent Dorfman in
‘Animal House,’ being introduced by
the house jock to Abdul, Mohammed and
the other misfits struggling through
Rush. If you’re a black at Washington
and Lee and went through Rush, you
may know the feeling well.

Norman Sigler, a freshman from
Alabama, was one of only three blacks
to go through Rush this year. He didn’t
seem to be bothered by the almost total-
ly white freshman class because he was
the first black to graduate from his high
school. When asked why he decided to go
through Rush, Sigler said he ‘‘just
wanted a chance to meet people and
hopefully get a bid in a fraternity.”

Often he said he got the impression
that fraternity members were just try-
ing to be nice. ‘‘Some houses were fairly
shocked by my walking in, while others
came right up and talked to me,” he
said.

David Perdue, president of the Inter-
fraternity Council, said the group en-
courages everyone to go through Rush.
When questioned about blacks and fra-
ternities, Perdue responded that ‘‘we
handle that whole question with a lais-
sez-faire approach.’’ He said he hoped
fraternities would look at every fresh-
man going through with an open mind
and trying not to be biased. ‘‘We are not
in a position to tell a fraternity whether
they have to let in minorities or not,’’ he
added. ‘‘It’s a question that is up to the
individual house.”

As the only black member of a frater-
nity at W&L, sophomore Everett Hami-
lton of Sigma Nu can look at Rush as a
member, as a minority and as a past
freshman. Hamilton agreed with Sigler
that he was treated cordially by the
fraternities but said he also got the im-
pression the fraternities for the most
part didn’t know what to do with him. He
added that ‘‘as a minority student there
are certain realities you must face.
Some fraternities just won’t let blacks
in.”

When black students in a ‘‘Southern
school’ start trying to get into lily white
fraternities, visions of Black Panther
movements, sit-ins and race riots of the
60s come to the minds of the more
conservative elements of the school. Yet
both Hamilton and Sigler said they had
no intention of trying to make any
‘statement’ or cause trouble. Their
purpose, they said, was to have a good
time and meet people.

John L. White, dean of minority af-
fairs, agrees that Rush is an important
part of ‘‘the W&L experience.”’

“One of the biggest misconceptions
among students is that we tell black
students not to go through Rush,” he
said. ‘Actually, we want all of them to
experience it.’’ He also added the Stu-
dent Association for Black Unity was not
designed to compete with the fraterni-
ties. Hamilton, as a case in point, is a
member of both.

men and presidents of the fraternities,

Violate Rush rules ?

You must be joking

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

Despite widespread conversation
about ‘‘all that dirty rushing,’ the Inter-
fraternity Council Tuesday night voted
penalties against only one house for
Rush infractions, and even that ruling is
being appealed.

Both student leaders and administra-
tion officials said this week that
widespread violation of regulations
went unreported this year because of
fraternities’ reluctance to report each
other.

House presidents say that because
houses frequently had damaging infor-
mation about each other, there emerged
a tacit agreement of silence that
prevented a public airing of interhouse
complaints.

The IFC voted a $200 fine against
Sigma Alpha Epsilon for exceeding the
two-band limit during Rush. The house
had bands on both Saturdays of Rush,
and then had a third one in the country
the second Sunday. SAE maintains that
the limit on bands applied only to Satur-
days and therefore is appealing the fine.

‘Verv few people are willing to name
names or go in front of the IFC,’’ said
Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of
students for fraternity affairs. ‘‘To say
that there are problems is not good
without a specific complaint.”

“T have heard compiaints registered,
but I think it’s important that they come
in front of the IFC,’’ he continued. ‘* You
can’t deal with general compiaints

—you need someone who will fill out an
official compiaint.”’

David Perdue, president of the IFC,
agreed with Murphy that few are willing
to “name names.”

“I didn’t expect many Rush violations
to be reported because I’ve heard people
talking, but no one has been specific and
no one has made a big deal about it,’’ he
said.

“I guess people expect some viola-
tions to take place and I guess they just
don’t want to make a big fuss,’” he add-
ed. ‘I’m aware of hearsay but nothing
worth investigating.

“T really don’t think there are that

' many violations, to tell you the truth

—just a few people stretching the gray
area.”’

Head dormitory counselor Bob Toma-
so said that ‘‘people are very hesitant
about reporting a violation. It takes
than just a trivial matter.”’

‘“T think ail the fraternities are
together on this one,” he said. ‘‘They all
hate the system as it now stands
—especially the open house signup. |
don’t attribute the fewer violations this
year to the new rules but instead to the
fact that the fraternities are sticking
together more.”

Reynoids Thompson, president of Phi
Delta Theta, was upset at the volume of
new rules.

“There were so many rules that they
were hard to keep up with,”’ he said. “‘As
far as violations go, I think there were
more misunderstood rujies than ones

Sweet Briar student killed

APPOMATTOX — One Sweet
Briar College sophomore was
killed and another was seriously
injured early Saturday morning
‘in an automobile accident that
occured while the two returned
to campus from Hampden-Syd-
ney College, authorities said

The accident occurred at 4
a.m. on U.S. 460 in Appomattox
County just outside of Spout
Spring, state police said.

The dark biue 1983 BMW was
westbound when it went off the
right shoulder of the road, hit a
guard rail, and overturned seve-
ral times, according to the police
report.

Anne Kathryn Adams, an 18-
year-old from Melbourne,

Beach, Fla., was killed after she
was thrown from the back seat
of the car. The medical exam-
iner said she died of internal in-
juries.

The driver of the car, Tracy
Anne McCoy of North Andover
Mass., was placed in the inten-
sive care unit at Lynchburg
General Hospital. Her condition
was upgraded to ‘‘satisfactory”’
yesterday.

‘Normally, we can give the
condition of the patient, but in
this case, I can’t give out any in-
formation at all,’’ said nursing
supervisor Elaine Merritt.

State police officer Daniel P.
Beamon, who is conducting a
confidential investigation of the

accident, said that ‘‘the tragedy
of itis that it’s pretty simple — it
seems they just drove off the
road.”

Sophomore Kristen Whitney,
the third person in the car, was
treated at the hospital Saturday
ind then released. She has now
gone to California.

Karen Wagner, Sweet Briar’s
assistant dean of students, said
that an organized mixer was
scheduled at Hampden-Sydnev
Friday night, but that there was
no indication whether the stu-
dents had attended it or were
simply visiting friends at the col-

lege.

Monday night the Executive
Committee refused to issue a
policy statement making it an
honor violation to use a fake
identification card to pur-
chase alcohol at the Cockpit or
at university functions.

The subject arose when
senior David Sprunt, a mem-
ber of the audience, said he
found a wailet containing a

 

fake I.D. and a real I.D. He

said he used the real [.D. to

return the wallet to its owner.
‘*T was just wondering it the
Executive Committee should
make a point of saying that us-
ing a fake 1.D....is an honor
violation,’ Sprunt said.

 

A.V. for D.? Mavee..,

‘*T think the Executive Com-
mittee frowns upon the use of
fake identification,’ EC Presi-
dent Cole Dawson said hesi-
tantly as the audience laugh-
ed. ‘“‘As for it being an honor
violation, that’s decided on the
merits of the individual case.’

Vice President James White
concurred, saying, ‘‘What we
told freshmen during orienta-
tion was that every case is in-
dividual, but in the past there
was a case where the student
was brought up for and
H.V....We’ve made a state-
ment to the freshmen already
during orientation, so I don’t
think anymore need be said.”’

Opinion

 

Bumbling balloting

‘It happens every year... .”’
Sophomore Executive Committee representative
Andrew Caruthers’ comment came during EC debate

Monday night about the most recent student body _

election — for freshman class officers.

Defeated in his quest for office, a freshman had
complained that the EC, after announcing that there
would be two polling places, had set up but one. The
EC’s response, perhaps technically correct, was that
there was a second poll at the Law School.

This, after the EC clearly had indicated — both in
words and in a list of regulations distributed to can-
didates — that two polls would be open for freshmen
to vote.

Confronted by the resignation of a Voting Regula-
tions Board chairman and a lack of people to man
those two polls, the EC (Read: One or two EC
members), though, ‘‘decided’’ to reduce the number
of freshman polls to one.

This is the second consecutive week in which the
student body has discovered an Executive Committee
decision made behind closed doors, by less than the
full committee, for the wrong reasons. Last week, we
learned that President Cole Dawson had added a
phrase to the White Book — a phrase specifically op-
posed by last year’s EC.

The voting fiasco, though, raises another, overar-
ching point. The EC has been through more VRB
chairmen (yet another resigned last week) than the
Soviet Union has premiers.

Something must be done. The job of a VRB chair-
man — convincing fellow students to spend an hour or
more watching polls and then counting the ballots—is
far from glamorous. It seems only to be a time-
consuming job for which the EC did not want to be
responsible. But that should not discount the impor-
tance of the job.

The VRB was established with good intent — to
separate the Executive Committee from the voting
process, in which it usually has an inherent interest.
However, perhaps the time has come to re-evaluate
the role of the VRB.

For once, it would be nice to have an election
without complaints, charges and recriminations.

We would rather not be in a position such as that
suggested jokingly by Caruthers Monday night:
‘Next year, let’s not have elections. Let’s just go,
‘Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.’ ”’

Calyx changes explained

To the Editors:

As editor of the 1985 Calyx, I
feel obligated to inform the stu-
dent body of some of the planned
changes to this year’s book.

First and foremost is the
change to a 12-month book in-
stead of previous years’ nine
month books. By doing this, we
will be able to cover more of the
school year than we have in the
past. Included will be an expand-
ed sports section, with spring
sports, scoreboards and rosters;
important spring events, such as
Spring Weekend and, of course,
Graduation; all events that have
not been covered by the Calyx in
recent memory. Other events
that will be covered will include
last year’s Mock Convention and
the coeducation decision. To
facilitate the inclusion of these
events, the Calyx will have to be
delivered in the fall.

Calm down, calm down now,
don’t panic. I know that this
decision may be unpopular.
After all, the Calyx has been
delivered in the spring for so
long that it has become a tradi-
tion. We all know that old tradi-
tions die hard. I believe, how-
ever, that this change is much
needed and will allow a true
YEAR-book to be made. The
Calyx should be the record of
what happens during the
academic year at Washington
and Lee, and covering only
seven or eight months of that
year is inadequate.

You may be thinking that you
won’t be able to get a copy of the
book, but let me reassure you

that you will have a better oppor-
tunity to get your book than you
have had in the past. If you are
an underclassman, you will be
able to pick your book up in the
matriculation line next year. If
you are a senior, your book will
be mailed to you directly from
the publisher at no extra cost to
you. This system guarantees
that you will have an opportunity
to get your Calyx.

I intend this year’s Calyx to be
an improvement over past
years’ books, including an ex-
panded group section, faculty
pictures by department, an in-
tramural sports page, a ‘‘Year
in the News” section, an enter-
tainment section and an expand-
ed ‘Year on Campus”’ section.
To do this we will have to
enlarge the book by 50 pages.
Another positive change that I
would like to make is the addi-
tion of more color pictures. With
the 12-month book, our color
photo deadline is pushed back
far enough that we may be able
to include color Fancy Dress pic-
tures. These two changes are
possible if the Calyx can raise
the funds needed for their im-
plementation.

Here I would like to correct
some popular misconceptions
about who receives a Calyx. You
pay for your book through the
student activities fee, which is
paid with tuition. In the matricu-
lation line you are only paying
for your picture in the book;
even if you did not get your pic-
ture in the Calyx you are still en-

Discussion
to focus on

Jraternities

To the Editors:

Are the fraternities being pro-
secuted? Is the very foundation
of fraternal life being undermin-
ed — the very life that is such an
integral part of the W&L experi-
ence? If these questions have
come into your mind in the last
several weeks and you have
some constructive criticism,
then I urge you to attend the next
EC meeting this Monday (Oct. 1)
at 7 p.m. in the EC office. The
issues to be discussed will in-
clude the present Rush system,
Wednesday night parties, the
“four party per semester’
limitation and any other fra-
ternity-related concerns. I en-
courage ail fraternity presi-
dents, SAC members and IFC
representatives to come, along
with any freshmen with impres-
sions of the recent Rush sche-
dule, and all other students, ad-
ministrative personnel and
faculty members that would like
to voice an opinion. We can form
a more constructive and realis-
tic impression of the current
situation if everyone comes with
specific thoughts in mind.

On another note, I must com-
mend the freshmen on genera-
ting so much interest in last
Monday’s election. It was great
to see such a large turnout. In
the past, less than half of the
freshmen have turned out to
vote, and I am pleased to say
that over 50 percent turned out
last Monday. It covered a fairly
even distribution among the two
dorm areas — 55 percent of
Graham-Lees voted and 42 per-
cent of the Davis/Gilliam area
voted. It shows a strong amount
of support for campus affairs.

I must, at the same time, ad-
dress a concern of mine relating
to recent campaigning practic-
es. On Monday, Sept. 17, there
were specific guidelines estab-
lished when freshmen petitions
were handed in to the EC (poster
limits, spending limits, and
poster sizes). In several cases,
abuses of these limitations
would have led to the disquali-
fication of several candidates if
they had made it into the runoff
— this would have been an unfor-
tunate result. Please pay closer
attention to these rules in the
future.

Also, there were several com-
plaints voiced that some fresh-
men did not know about the e-
lection. Let me remind all can-

didates that it is your respon-
sibility to make your consti-
tuents aware of this fact. The
Voting Regulations Board can
only do so much advertising for
elections through the EC
minutes and The Ring-tum Phi.

Congratulations to those suc-
cessful candidates and good luck
with your new responsibilities.

Cole Dawson
President
Executive Committee

LSAT: San

Creatures are to be introduced into the ter-
rarium at the rate of one every five
minutes. Five minutes is sufficient time for
one creature to devour another or to sting
another to death.

A Mog will eat a Nog.

A Nog will eat a Pog, and will eat a Rog
unless a Wog is present.

A Wog will eat a lone Mog, but two Mogs
together will sting a Wog to death.

Which combination of three creatures
could be introduced into the terrarium in
any order with no casualties?

For the majority of rational, clear-
thinking Americans, the response to this
problem is simple: WHO CARES?

But, unfortunately, for a large
number of Washington and Lee seniors,
the admissions office at the University
of Virginia School of Law cares very
much, as do the admissions offices at
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Georgetown,
Duke... '

And forget the Wogs, Nogs and Pogs.
No sympathy is deserved there. Rather,
save it for those poor innocent students
who, aspiring to greatness at the na-
tion’s top law schools, will find them-
selves alone and stung by the two Mogs
this weekend while taking the Law
School Admissions Test.

I was shocked recently when I found
out that one of Domino’s Pizza’s top
delivery men was Washington and Lee,
Class of 1978. Obviously, he was a pre-
law liberal arts major aspiring to

  

MY VIEW

ni

greatness as one of the country’s top
criminal or corporate lawyers until he
ran into the LSAT. The LSAT, from my
understanding, has turned out some of
America’s most intelligent and over-
qualified high school English and
history teachers and manual workers.

My first encounter with the LSAT
came my sophomore year here. Until
then, I had imagined it as being nothing
but a glorified Scholastic Aptitude Test
of the type needed to go to college.

But my roommate, a senior, was a C-
school major with law school plans. My
most vivid memories of the first month
of that year of living together are of him
dragging in at 10:30 or 11 every other
night for almost forever, his hair muss-
ed up, his eyes bloodshot and his brain
frazzled from four hours of a prep
course designed to make him logically
see that a Mog, Pog and Rog are the
three creatures that should be introduc-
ed into the aquarium, obviously, be-
cause from the original set of conditions,
it follows that none of those three prey
upon the others.

My second most vivid memory is the

 

day the results were returned in the
mail. It was a dark and gloomy day over
202 S. Randolph St. Ducking thrown ob-
jects and allowing myself to be used as a
verbal sounding board, I realized that
the LSATs can play a major role in the
direction your life is going to take. The
next week, my roommate started apply-
ing to divinity schools.

As I see it, it is a no-win situation.
If you do poorly, say good-bye to law
school. But if you take a prep course,
study hard and do well, you get into the
law school of your choice....but only at
the consequences of having all faculties
of logical reasoning shot for life.

Actually, maybe it is time for Drs.
Margand, Elmes, Jarrard, et. al., to
take a scientific look at these students
who have been subjected to such per-
verse mind games at the pinnacle of
their academic careers. Do students
who master the logic behind such il-
logical reasoning really begin to develop
the same traits as an isolated rhesus
monkey: withdrawal, biting themselves
and general anti-social behavior?
Maybe that is why W&L’s “favorite
tradition” according to one “college ex-
pert,”’ is getting drunk, rolling down the
road and abusing women: we do have a
high percentage of pre-law students.
And are these symptoms permanent, or
simply long-term? Professor Margand,
we need your help!

The ‘‘Wog”’ problem is an example of

e Inside Insanity’

the part of the test known as analytical
reasoning. The other parts are a writing
sample, reading comprehension, issues
and facts and a section dubiously dub-
bed “logical reasoning.”

“Apple pie tastes good. Since ice
cream is not apple pie, it doesn’t taste
good.”” That is but one example of the
‘logical’ reasoning necessary to under-
stand to do well on this section. The key
is to put logic in the sense of reality
aside and look at logic only in terms of
the given scenario. Understanding that
premise, when given:

All alligators play the piano, except for
Elmo. Some alligators tap dance, but none
both tap dance and play a musical instru-
ment.”

“It becomes second nature for me to
logically justify the conclusion that
“Elmo the alligator tap dances.”’

Right.

All of it reminds me of the advice Col-
umbia gave to her beloved Eddie right
before he was mutilated with an ice pick
by his transvestite lover Dr. Frank-n-
furter in one of my all-time something
movies, “The Rocky Horror Picture
Show.” The advice? ‘Stay Sane Inside
Insanity, Lock the Door and Throw
Away the Key “‘.

But as the fateful day draws nigh, only
one thing really scares me: I think I
understand why the Mog, Pog and Rog
are in the terrarium together.

Is it too late to go to med school?

titled to one. In fact, one of the
problems that we have faced in
recent years is that not every
student would pick up his Calyx;
consequently, we have about 120
1983 books and about 100 of last
year’s books in our office. If you
have not picked up your books,
please come by the Calyx office
sometime and we will be happy
to give you one.

Another popular misconcep-
tion is the cost of the book. Last
year, approximately $7.50 of
your student tax paid for your
copy of the Calyx. The cost of
publishing each book was ap-
proximately $27.75. All of our
other revenues come from con-
tributions from your parents,
advertisements, fraternities and

portraits. We rely heavily on
contributions to pay for the book.
The publishing cost of this year’s
book is budgeted at $43,000. We
are asking the Executive Com-
mittee for $15,000, so as you can
readily see, you are getting a
bargain.

I hope that these changes will
be received as they are intended,
That being the production of the
best publication possible as a
memento of those years spent at
Washington and Lee. Any input,
both positive and negative,
which results in a better book
would be appreciated as would
participation by anyone in-
terested in being a part of the
Calyx staff. If you are interested
in working on the Calyx come by
the office anytime and we’ll be
glad to discuss your interests.

Tampering with Book dangerous

To the Editors:

The little article on page 5 of
last week’s Phi horrified me. Did
Cole Dawson really, all by him-
self, add a clause to the White
Book — did the chief trustee of
the honor system not know bet-
ter than to add an unratified
clause to the honor code? Did he
really quote the registrar, who
has absolutely nothing to do with
the administration of the honor
system, to support this maneu-
ver — did he think an ad-
ministrator’s opinions bound
him in any way? Did he really
not see the significance of the
clause he added — did he not
understand that marking stu-
dents’ transcripts is not a casual
personal decision?

Mr. Dawson perverted the
honor code, as the White Book
states it. He decided that ‘‘not in

good standing’’ would be stamp-
ed on the transcripts of those ex-
pelled in private honor hearings.
This is completely contrary to
the philosophy of our honor
system.

We have an honor system be-
cause we choose to live hon-
orably here — we recognize that
it is the right way, to live. We
have the single sanction so that
we can remove those who cannot
or will not live honorably. We do
not expell students in order to
punish or extract payment; this
would be absurd, negative and
impossible.

Our honor system is beautiful
— and different from other
honor systems — because it is
positive; our community cele-
brates honor in a world of
dishonor — we choose this. We
only have a ‘‘system”’ to remove

 

those who don’t share this
choice. When we don’t mark the
transcript (of a private expul-
sion) we demonstrate where our
values lie: living honorably with
honorable people — not teaching
honor to the world by branding
those who don’t belong here.

KC cuts near]

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee
passed a student organization
budget of more than $100,000 at
12:15 this morning after drastic-
ally cutting the budget requests
of the Independent Union, the
Frisbee Club, the literary
magazine Ariel, the Mock Con-
vention and the Calyx.

Of the 15 budget requests sub-
mitted to the EC, only two — the
Rugby Club’s and the Ski
Club’s — were granted. The re-
maining 13 were reduced by
varying amounts. ?

The EC had $88,350, not in-
cluding $7,000 for the student
body reserve fund and $5,600 in
EC expenses and funding, to
distribute among the organiza-
tions, whose requests totaled
$105,017.90.

The funds come from the $75
activities fee each student pays
with his tuition. This figure
reflects a $5 increase over last
year; an additional $25 goes
toward the new student activi-
ties pavilion.

The Independent Union, which
requested $1,200 to provide
entertainment geared toward in-
dependents, received $257 pen-
ding its first meeting Wednes-
day, after which, EC Vice Presi-
dent and finance subcommittee
chairman James White said, the
EC will be able to determine the
amount of interest in the group
and decide whether to award it
any additional funds.

White and senior represen-
tative Bob Tomaso said the EC
should limit the Independent
Union's budget to organizational
costs, not entertainment costs.

The EC voted 6-3 to accept this
budget for the IU, with Secre-
tary Sam Dalton, junior repre-
sentative Pat Hayden and sopho-
more representative Shayam
Menon opposed.

If the EC decides to award
more money to the Independent
Union, led by chairman Chuck
Diffenderffer, it would come out

of the student body reserve fund.

next week to become final
—White said he asked the stu-
dent organizations to ensure that
they don’t run a deficit this year.
University Treasurer E. Stewart
Epley has indicated that if
deficits such as last year’s ap-
pear again, the W&L Business
Office may try to take more con-
trol over student funds, White
said.

Last year the student body
organizations showed a deficit of
$1,411...The EC depleted its
reserve fund to bail out nume-
rous organizations — partic-
ularly the Student Activities
Board — that exceeded their
budgets.

“IT anticipate a little more
responsible accounting — this
year,’ White said.

The following is a list of each
organization, the amount it re-
received and the discussion
preceding the decision:

¢ The Student Activities Board
received $49,450, $7,000 of which
will be returned to the EC to
replace the reserve fund it help-
ed deplete last year.

The finance subcommittee,
which made a recommendation
on each organization's budget
last night, and the SAB had
agreed on a figure $50 greater
before budget deliberations, but
the $50 later was given to the In-
dependent Union.

¢ The Ring-tum Phi requested
$14,852 and received $13,000. The
EC said one of the reasons for
the cut was that the Phi ended
last year with a surplus of
almost $600, which, as establish-
ed by the student body constitu-
tion, reverted to the Publications
Board, which oversees the four
student publications.

One of the themes recurrent in
the explanations of the publica-
tions’ budgets was that if a
publication needed financial
assistance during the school
year, it should turn to the
Publications Board, rather than

other areas in which the EC said
savings could be made that
would still allow Sprunt to add 50

e Contact, the speaker sym-
posium, received $9,000 from the

was used elsewhere in the EC
budget.

team, requested $1,454.55 and
received $1,200. Sports clubs
such as this generally were iook-

quest of $1,400 was cut by $300
because that was the amount of
its surplus last year.

EC decides on honor system changes

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

The Executive Committee
discussed honor system matters
at its weekly meeting Monday
night, opening one can of worms
and closing another.

Vice President James White
put forth a motion that would
give the EC an additional two-
minute statement during the
closing remarks in an open
honor hearing. ~

The motion, passed 80 with
two abstentions, needs to be ap-
proved a second time next week
because it deals with the honor
system.

The committee also deleted
two portions of the Honor Sys-
tem’s White Book that said that
a student found guilty in a closed
honor hearing will have a nota-

tion added to his transcript say-
ing he withdrew in bad standing.

Student Body President Cole’
Dawson said last night he added
the sentences to the White Book
over the summer because, ‘‘I
just felt this went along with
what we passed year.”

Dawson introduced the idea of
giving the EC more time to
make its case in open trials by
saying that some law students
had told him that the EC was
taken advantage of in open hear-
ings last year.

“They feel the EC is at a dis-
advantage by not having the last
say in the open hearing,’ Daw-
son said.

‘We do not have a chance to
refute or add anything to the
defense’s statements,”’ he add-
ed.

Currently, the EC makes a

five-minute closing statement,
followed by a statement by the
defense. The motion would give
the EC an additional two-minute
statement after that.

Senior law representative Gor-
don Hammock said that is the
procedure used in U.S. courts.

“This is in fairness to our side
as well as theirs,’’ Dawson said.

In deleting the portions of the
White Book that Dawson said he
added over the summer, the EC
claimed jurisdiction over nota-
tions on the transcripts of expell-
ed students.

One of the reasons he made the
changes, Dawson said last week,
was that he was uncertain if it
was in the committee’s power to
decide the contents of a student’s
transcript.

“T’ve talked with Dean (of
Students Lewis) John about it,

and he confirmed that it is within
the EC’s jurisdiction,” Dawson
said.

The discussion of whether to
re-remove the sentences center-
ed around the same questions
that were debated when they
were first removed last year.

Caruthers said that having a
student’s transcript say ‘‘expell-
ed” only after a guilty verdict in
an open hearing would provide a
deterrent to appealing to the
open hearing.

White added that since it was
in the spirit of the honor system
to keep decisions private, it
would be improper to tell a stu-
dent’s future employer or future
school that he had been found
guilty in a closed hearing.

“On the other hand, if he
wants to go open with it, then
he’s made it public,’’ White said.

By Cotton Puryear The Ring: tum Phi

Posters for this year’s freshman class elections were both abun-

dant and original,

Freshman turnout 55%

About 55 percent, or 198
students, of the freshman class
voted in Monday’s election for
class officers and an Executive
Committee representative, pro-
mpting EC Vice President
James White to call it a ‘great
turnout.”’ .

Jim Lancaster was elected
freshman class vice-president
Monday and John Faulkner won
the University Council represen-
tative election.

In today’s runoff, David
Makepeace, Jay Markley and
Brandt Wood were on the ballot
for freshman EC representative.
A runoff also was held for
freshman class president, for
which Andrew Abernathy and
Micheal Henry competed.

First year law students also
voted in a runoff today for an EC
representative. That contest was
between James Crutchfield and
Bill Thompson.

Former math professor dies

Felix P. Welch, former Cincin-
nati Professor of Mathematics
at Washington and Lee, died
Saturday following a brief il-
Iness. He was 78.

A native of Kewanee, Miss.,
Welch taught mathematics at
Washington and Lee for 30
years, 25 of those as head of the
department of mathematics.

He earned his bachelor of
science degree in chemistry
from Mississippi State Universi-
ty in 1929. He held a master’s
degree in mathematics from the
University of Texas and receiv-
ed his Ph.D. in mathematics
from the University of Illinois.

He served with the United
States Army during World War
II and retired from the Army in
1961 with the rank of major.

Welch began his teaching
career at his undergraduate
alma mater, Mississippi State,
in 1929. He taught at the Stark-
ville, Miss., school for 18 years
before joining the faculty at

Washington and Lee in 1947.

He held W&L’s Cincinnati Pro-
fessorship of Mathematics
throughout his W&L teaching
career.

One of Welch’s fields of
research involved developing
visual aids in mathematics. In
1967, Welch produced ‘The
Theorem of the Mean,”’ an ani-
mated film sponsored by the
Mathematical Association of
America.

He was the co-author with
Washington and Lee mathe-
matics Professor Robert S.
Johnson of a_ text-workbook,
“Calculus.”

He was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, the American Mathe-
matical Association, the Math-
ematical Association of America
and the Virginia Academy of
Science.

When Welch retired from ac-
tive teaching in 1977, the W&L
board of trustees elected him
Cincinnati Professor of Mathe-
matics, Emeritus.

Elections prompt complaints

_mpevraanamiersne sar aD SPECIE ES SAT!
By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN

Staff Reporter

 

Monday’s elections for Ex-
ecutive Committee represen-
tatives and freshman class of-
fieers have prompted what EC
President Cole Dawson termed a
“legitimate complaint.”

At the EC meeting Monday
evening, Steve Roth, a freshman
class presidential candidate who
failed to qualify for today’s
runoffs by six votes, pointed out
that only one poll was open to
freshmen and contended that the
location of that poll was unfair to
some candidates.

Roth, a resident of Davis Dor-
mitory, said that candidates
from Graham-Lees Dormitory
had an advantage since the poll
was located in the Graham-Lees
quad.

“Everyone that won (in Mon-
day’s election) was from
Graham-Lees,” Roth said.

After Roth had presented his
criticism to the EC, sophomore
representative Andrew Caruth-
ers determined from the list of
voters that of 232 Graham-Lees
residents, 133, or 57 percent,
voted; of 58 Davis Dormitory
residents, 27, or 46 percent,
voted; and of 87 students living
in Gilliam, 34, or 40 percent,
voted.

Dawson said he believes the
figures to be ‘‘close enough’’ not
to have been a factor in the out-
come of Monday’s election.

Concerning Roth’s complaint,
Dawson said, “I think the stat-
istics show that having the one
poll in Graham-Lees was not as
great a factor as he thought.”

Dawson said he believes that
the amount of polling places had
no bearing on the election’s out-

come. “‘I think if it had been an
election other than the freshman
election then it would have been
a big deal,” he said.

“‘T think we did conform to the
rules,’’ he said. ‘‘That is my opi-
nion.”’

Vice President James White
moved to stand behind the elec-
tion results pending any input
from the Voting Regulations
Board, until last week chaired
by senior Burford Smith, who
resigned.

While this motion was being
discussed, Caruthers pointed
out, ‘But the VRB’s going to
turn to us and say, ‘What do I do
guys?’ ”’

The motion passed with only
Caruthers opposed.

According to the Voting
Regulation Board’s_ election
regulations, ‘‘there shall be a
minimum of two and a maxi-
imum of five places for polling.’

VRB Chairman Bill Metzger
accounted for that minimum,
saying that another poll was
located at the Law School, where
first year law students were
voting for an EC representative.

Metzger, however, confirmed
that no freshman ballots were
located at the Law School poll.

Chris Carter, who was the
VRB chairman for the latter
part of the ’83‘84 school year,
said, ‘‘If there were no ballots
(at the Law School) for the
freshmen, then they (the VRB)
are in violation of the regula-
tions.”

Carter, however, called the
rules ‘‘vague.”’ ‘“They need to be
straightened out,’’ he said.

At an EC meeting Monday,
Sept. 17, Carter recommended
that the VRB have more than
one main campus polling place.

That evening, the EC announced
that two main campus polls
would be set up for the election.

Metzger, who was appointed
VRB chairman Sept. 20, said
having only one main campus
poll was a ‘‘decision between the
EC and me.”’ He said he believes
the decision does not violate the
VRB regulations, “‘not in my in-
terpretation of the rules.”

‘“T’m standing by the elec-
tion,’’ he said.

“Shortness of time’’ was a fac-
tor in the decision to reduce the
number of polling places from
the number announced at the EC
meeting, said Metzger. “I really
didn’t know what was going on
until a few days ago when I got
hold of the regulations,”’ he said
Monday evening. One of the
responsibilities of the VRB
chairman is to be sure that the
polls are staffed at all times.

Metzger said he “realized
quite quickly that it would take a
lot of effort’’ to find the man-
power to staff the polls.

As a former VRB chairman,
Carter also acknowledged the
difficult task of finding students
to man the polls.

Roth, however, still is not
satisfied.

“Technically they (the EC)
got themselves out of it,” he said
in regard to the confusion over
the number of polls. But Roth
said that the Law School and
undergraduate campus are ‘‘two
different schools,’’ and that the
VRB’s and EC’s decisions re-
main questionable.

Roth also recognizes, ‘‘I can’t
do anything about their deci-
sion.”’

But he said he will not sit idly.
“T plan to run next year,”’ Roth
said, ‘‘to try and straighten it
out.”’

Visiting professor brings Oxford to WGL

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

In one way, saying that you
are going to study at Oxford is
like saying that you are going to
study in the Boston area. Neither
statement narrows things down
a whole lot.

But America’s claims to old,
tradition-filled universities,
even in the Boston area, pale in
comparison to Oxford, Harvard,
America’s oldest college, was
founded in 1636. University Col-
lege, the oldest of the more than
30 colleges that comprise Oxford
University, was founded in 1249.

From Friday to Wednesday,
Washington and Lee, the sixth
oldest institution of higher learn-
ing in the United States, played
host to George Cawkwell, the
vice-master of University Col-
lege.

After Professor Cawkwell’s
lecture to a history class, one
sophomore said it was the best
lecture he had heard since com-
ing to W&L. Why? “It was not
just a talk, but a lecture,’’ he
said. Another student said he
“Jost track of all time’’ during
the lecture.

Asked what makes Oxford uni-
que, a question which has been
scrupulously examined here at
W&L during the past year, Pro-
fessor Cawkwell did not answer
by citing the all-male atmos-
phere, because Oxford is coedu-
cational.

“The two most interesting
things about Oxford are the col-
legiate system...(and) that in-
struction is not based on lec-
tures, but on tutorials,’ said
Cawkwell, adding that some stu-
dents never even attend a lec-
ture during their Oxford years.

According to Cawkwell, the
' college system provides stu-
dents with ‘‘a fairly small group

 

George Cawkwell

and a fairly close group’ with
whom to associate. ‘They live
together in the college and form
their friendships,”’ he said.

Each of the 12,000 students at
Oxford is assigned to a tutor in
his respective college. Each
week, the student writes an
essay that he must defend oral-
ly.

“T would normally have 14 or
15 people who I am responsible
for. I spend about an hour argu-
ing with them about what they
said. It makes students work the
way they don’t work elsewhere,”
Cawkwell said.

The tutorial system is any-
thing. but heaven for a pro-
crastinator. ‘‘The college has
close supervision,” Cawkwell
explained. Those students who
do not do their work are ‘“‘sent
down,”’ as they say on the isle,
or, as Americans say, ‘‘expell-
ed.”’

Neither the college system nor
the tutorial system has been du-
plicated anywhere, according to
Cawkwell. ‘‘No one in his right
mind would set out to create

 

 

Snacks, Beer, Wine

such a thing now. It’s just an ac-
cident of historical survival,’
said the tutor of ancient history,
citing finances as the major rea-
son for his statement.

Although Cawkwell said he is
not very familiar with the
American system of education,
he believes that the English tend
to specialize in a subject at a
much earlier age than do the
Americans.

“They don’t do a broad sweep
of subjects as you do in your
B.A.’s,’’ Cawkwell said. “I think
you’ve got this broad problem
that if you have breadth, you
don’t have depth, and if you have
depth, you don’t have breadth.”

Breadth and depth do not seem
to be a problem for Cawkwell,
who seems very much the Brit-
ish schoolmaster with his white

hair neatly combed back, his
tweed jacket and his accent. A
native New Zealander, he earn-
ed a degree in Classics before
coming to Oxford on a Rhodes
Scholarship in 1946. At Oxford,
Cawkwell earned his degrees in
ancient history and philosophy,
and his ‘‘blue”’ in rugby.

Cawkwell explained that a
‘“‘blue’’ is someone who has
played against Cambridge.
“‘People try very hard to get a
blue,”’ Cawkwell said.

Students chosen to play
against Cambridge receive a
card asking them, ‘‘Would you
like to play against Cam-
bridge?”’ ona certain date.

Cawkwell said the Rhodes
Scholarships used to be more
sports-oriented. The major
sports at Oxford are rowing,

cricket and rugby, three of the
lesser known sports in America.

Cawkwell is the author of the
biography, ‘Philip of Mace-
don.”’ His position of vice-master
would be similar to that of a
vice-president at an American
college.

On Monday, the precise, con-
cise and dry-humored scholar
gave a lecture titled,
‘“‘Thucydides and Athenian Im-
perialism’” in Northen Audi-
torium. Cawkwell gave a lecture
on Tuesday titled, ‘‘Let Sleeping
Dons Lie,”’ a discussion about
his life as a member of the Ox-
ford family.

Cawkwell has been to W&L in
the past and has had contact
with W&L through the exchange
program between the two uni-
versities.

ROTC head will recruit women

By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

Lt. Col. Luke B. Ferguson, the
new military professor and head
of Washington and Lee’s Army
ROTC, said that women will be
included in the program next
year.

He said he hopes to enroll 10
percent of next year’s female
students in ROTC. “I know
they’ll be the cream of the
crop,”’ he said.

One innovation planned by
Ferguson is to have upper-
classmen in the program per-
sonally contact every freshmen
and sophomore to make them
aware of the benefits of the
ROTC Program.

Sixteen types of scholarships
are offered through ROTC, rang-
ing from four-year to one-year

programs that combine tuition
payments, book allowances and
monthly stipends. Sixty-one
W&L students are currently
receiving some type of ROTC
scholarship.

Ferguson holds an_ under-
graduate degree from Campbell
University and a _ master’s
degree in counseling from
George Peabody College of Van-
derbilt University. He is an in-
fantry officer and has seen duty
in Germany, Vietnam, Alaska
and several parts of the United
States. This is his first ROTC
assignment.

He describes the ROTC pro-
gram here as ‘‘solid.”’

“W&L historically has done
well’’ in maintaining its quota of
commissions, even during the
early 70s, when ROTC pro-
grams were being assailed on
campuses across the country,
Col. Ferguson said. ‘‘The ideal of
the citizen-soldier prevailed at
Washington and Lee.”’

His plans for this year entail
expanding on that solid founda-
tion. Fifty percent of this year’s
participants are new, but, he
said, ‘‘We’ve got quality. The
program includes captains of
athletic teams and presidents of
fraternities.”

There are plans to increase the
number of adventure and field
training exercises, along with
possible aviation assistance
from the local Air National
Guard. Also, experts will be in-
vited to lecture on various
topics, including a local lawyer
to discuss military law, ex-
POWs to explain the military

 

Col. Luke Ferguson

Code of Conduct, and experts in
the fields of special operations,
ordinance and counter-terror-
ism.

The military science depart-
ment is currently developing a
“four-year marketing plan for
1988’’ designed to introduce W&L
students to the military way of
life.

Most students haven’t experi-
enced Army life,” said Fer-
guson, ‘‘and we’d like to see
them for one or two semesters,
even if they’re not potential can-
didates. The Army is not for
everyone, but everyone ought to
know about the Army.”’

On the personal side, Col.
Ferguson and his wife are both
natives of South Boston and have
six children, ranging in age from
four to 17. Although they enjoyed
the metropolitan setting of the
St. Petersburg, Fla., area from
which they have just come, they
are looking forward to the easy
pace of life in Lexington. Col.
Ferguson said it’s nice to ‘‘wake
up and see the mountains
through the window.”

LSAT: 60 face pressure to perform Saturday

 

By BILL BLOOM
Staff Reporter

 

To become an attorney is the
dream of a large number of
Washington and Lee students.
On an orientation questionnaire,
roughly a third of the freshman
class consistently expresses in-
terest in entering the legal pro-
fession. Four years later, about
15 to 20 percent of them will
enter law school.

For approximately 60 W&L
seniors, a key step in the
weeding process on the road to
becoming a lawyer comes this
Saturday, when they will con-
front the Law School Admissions
Test, known as the LSAT.

The LSAT can be compared to
that nemesis of high school
seniors, the SAT, except that, as
one LSAT-bound senior noted,

 

“everything about this test is at
a much greater intensity.’’ The
test is more difficult, and the
results are a more important
factor in the admissions process.

“The most significant deter-
minants for admission to law
school are the LSAT score and
the undergraduate GPA,”’ said
Edward O. Henneman, assistant
dean of the W&L Law School.
‘‘Anyone who tells you different-
ly is lying.’’

Henneman said an LSAT score
of 40 or above (on a scale of 48)
accompanied by a grade point
average of at least 3.75 almost
guarantees admission to a num-
ber of law schools, including
W&L’s.

An LSAT mark below 35 or a
sub-3.0 GPA may cause some
‘“‘uncertainties,’’ Henneman ad-
ded, but is still acceptable to
many law schools.

Because of the obvious pres-
sure to perform well on the
LSAT, Mike Cappeto, the as-
sociate dean of students and
director of career development
and placement, encourages stu-
dents ‘“‘not to take the LSAT or
any other graduate school exam
without adequate preparation.”’

That preparation can be ac-
complished on one’s own or
through the purchase of LSAT
preparation materials.

A more popular route though
is commercial preparatory in-
struction, such as the National
Center for Educational Testing
course offered at W&L this
month at a cost of $375 for 40
hours of preparation.

David Deipierre, a third-year
law student who was the instruc-
tor for the NCET course, said
“some parts of the LSAT are
coachable,’’ although less so

David Delpierre teaches an LSAT class this week.

Law student teaches course

David Delpierre, a third year
law student who is acting as the
Washington and Lee instructor
for the National Center for
Educational Testing’s LSAT
prep course, says he tries ‘‘to
provide the personal prepara-
tion needs of each person taking
the course.’’

Delpierre is a graduate of the
University of Virginia and is the
national secretary of the Student
Bar Association.

He said that having gone
through the admissions process
himself just over two years ago,

he is able to relate to the needs of
students who are today facing
that rigorous process. He said
the peer teaching situation that
exists is ‘‘an indirect fringe
benefit’’ to him.

Delpierre refers to the LSAT
as a “mandatory admissions re-
quirment”’ which is ‘‘coachable
in parts” and ‘is “taken under
pressure.” He urges students not
to “‘take the test more than once
because law schools either
average scores or use them

over going into the test cold.

The class motivates some
students to prepare more in-

who has found the course to be
‘*a confidence-builder.’’

said. “I tell people who I don’t

“Some people took the course

Stitution’s reputation, extracur-
ricular activities, work ex-
perience and recommendations.

Sutton disappointed by Rush

By JON MILES
Staff Reporter

 

“‘A general lack of coopera-
tion” by the fraternities has
resulted in this year’s Rush be-
ing ‘‘disappointing,’”’ compared
to last year, Lexington Police
Chief L.O. Sutton said yester-
day.

An incident Saturday, Sept. 15,
underscores what Sutton said
was the major complaint about
this year’s Rush: Noise. Wash-
ington and Lee does have an
open party policy, but Sutton
said more people are aware of
the parties than expected.

“There are 1,500 students par-
tying, but 5,000 Lexington
citizens have to hear it,’’ Sutton
said. On Sept. 15, the Phi Kappa
Sigma house was repeatedly
warned to reduce the sound from
its band, which could be heard as
far away as the police station.

A

 

Fraternity President Jim
Cobb admitted that he was warn-
ed “‘seven or eight” times about
the noise. In fact, in recent
weeks, verbal as well as written
warnings have been issued
against the house for having
bands outside.

‘We were more than fair,”’

said Sutton, who was on the

scene. ‘We tried to work with
the people to control the band.”
By 10:20 p.m., after almost an
hour of discussion, tempers were
flaring. Sutton said the fraterni-
ty was “‘irresponsible”’ for its ac-
tions.

Other noise violations have
continued to present problems,
particularly from Wednesday
night parties. Three summons
have been written already for
noise violations from those mid-
week events. At least two of
those were issued to houses that
were warned not to have the par-
ties.

“So far, I’ve gotten a lot of lip
service from presidents about
the noise, but nothing else,”’ Sut-
ton said.

That apparent lack of coopera-
tion, Sutton said, leads him to
feel that some fraternity
presidents have not maintained
control over social activities.
Sutton said he has been called
unfair by certain fraternities,
although ‘‘very few’’ have abid-
ed by all of the Rush rules set by
the University.

Sutton also pointed out that
there were no summons issued
last year until spring term, when
this year’s presidents took of-
fice.

“This batch isn’t acting
responsibly ,’’ Sutton said.

More students than usual also
have been seen in public with
open beer bottles, Sutton said.
“Bither they’re walking around
unconscious or they don’t give a
damn,” he added.

There have been no arrests
this year, though, for open con-
tainers. An arrest can be made
only if the person with the con-
tainer is seen drinking, Sutton
said, otherwise, the police can
only issue a warning.

“We extend students the
courtesy of not following them
around waiting for them to
drink,” he added, ‘‘but they are
abusing that courtesy by ignor-
ing the law.”

The two-week Rush limita-
tions were themselves ignored,
Sutton said: ‘‘It was only shorter
officially.”’ Sutton added that he
understands the competitive-
ness of Rush and how that is
enhanced in a shorter period of
time. But he said he does not
regard that as an excuse to
deliberately circumvent set
policy.

Enthusiastically plunging into
its preparations for the arrival
of the first female students in
1985, the Coeducation Steering
Committee organized six sub-
committees last week and began
reviewing reports from other
colleges that had switched from
all-male to coeducation.

“The mood is incredibly up-
beat,’’ said Dean Pamela Simp-
son, chairperson of the commit-
tee. ‘‘Sure there are going to be
problems that are part of this,
but what an opportunity,’”’ she
said.

Ms. Simpson attributed part of
the reason for the committee
members’ enthusiasm to encour-
aging news from the admissions
office. Van Pate, associate
director of admissions, told the
committee that admissions of-
fice personnel visiting high
sohools have been swamped with
requests for information about
Washington and Lee.

Some of the issues related to
the transition, such as admis-
sions, will be reviewed by the en-
tire committee, while the six
subcommittees will study pro-
blems in specific areas, . Ms.
Simpson explained.

Frank Parsons, executive as-
sistant to the president, will
chair the Residential Accomoda-
tions subcommittee, Dean
Robert Huntley will chair Cam-
pus Security and Immediate Re-
novations, Professor Nancy
Margand will chair Health and
Counseling, Athletic Director
William McHenry will chair the
Athletics subcommittee, Mich-
ael Black will chair Student Or-
ganizations and Lee Hollis will

chair the Fraternities subcom-
mittee.

The subcommittees on Re-
sidential Housing and Campus
Security and Immediate Re-
novations will work closely
together. In planning for a new
dormitory, Residential Accom-
odations will have to be aware of
what modifications in existing
dormitories will be made and
whether these modifications will
be permanent, Parsons said?
Consequently, Huntley will not
only chair his subcommittee on
immediate renovations, but also
serve on Parsons’s subcommit-
tee so the two do not ‘‘work at
cross purposes,’’ Parsons said.

Parsons rejected the idea of
unifying the two subcommittees
because that would have created
a committee that was too large
to be effective, he said.

Ms. Simpson said each sub-
committee chairperson would be
responsible for selecting the
members of his own subcommit-
tee. No deadlines have been set
for when subcommittees should
complete their work, she added.

Most of the committee’s work
at present involves reading
reports and plans from other
universities that have recently
gone coed, Ms. Simpson re-
ported.

Committee members also
hope to visit schools that have
switched to coeducation and
seem to have things in common
with Washington and Lee.

Students told of vote laws

By PAUL SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

In a recent Washington Post
column, Haynes Johnson noted
that of all the factors that will in-
fluence this fall’s presidential
election, ‘‘none stands out as
sharply or holds greater long-
term political significance than
the behavior and attitudes of
young voters, especially those on
college campuses.”

The rising national debt, cuts
in educational programs and in-
creasing war and peace tensions
are all issues that today’s young
people will have to deal with for
the forseeable future.

As a result, the National Stu-
dent Campaign for Voter Regis-
tration observes, ‘‘you would
think that every student in the
United States would be
registered and anxious to vote
this year.”’

Nevertheless, notes that
organization, 14 million
Americans between the ages of

18 and 24 are not registered to
vote, partially because ‘‘many
don’t know how to register or
have been blocked by archaic
laws.”

Some Washington and Lee
students are eligible to register
to vote in Lexington or Rock-
bridge County. The deadline for
doing so is next Saturday.

Since most W&L students are
not natives of this area, state law
says they cannot vote here un-
less they pass certain residency
requirements.

“A student is really no dif-
ferent from anyone else,’’ ex-
plained Lexington registrar
Lucille Joyce. They must main-
tain ‘‘residence all year ‘round
with the intention of staying
here,” not simply for ‘“‘the pur-
poses of nine months of going to
school.”

Elizabeth L. Burch, assistant
to the Rockbridge County regis-
trar, said residence eligibility is
‘not based on any one thing”’
and is ultimately left to the

New day bad for Pit

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

Along with the switch of ‘‘band
night”’ in the Cockpit from Tues-
day to Wednesday, the establish-
ed fraternity party night, came
the question: will it work? So
far, the answer appears to be
“no.”

The change was made, accor-
ding to Mike Guerriero, exec-
utive director of the Student Ac-
tivities Board, in order to pro-
vide independents with another
social option and to give frater-
nity members an alternative to
Wednesday night parties.

After two weeks, a successful
night has yet to be had.

W&L Food Services Manager
Jerry Darrell said Cockpit reve-
nues this year are not anywhere
near where they were last year.
At the bar, he said, the receipts
are about one-third to one-half of
what they were on Tuesdays last
year.

This is due, he feels, to the fact
that the Pit must compete head-
to-head with the fraternities.
Darrell said he is not worried by
the decline in business, however.
‘“‘We’re there to provide a ser-
vice, and whatever happens,
happens,”’ he said.

“We're glad to have it on
Wednesdays,’’ he continued,

“‘because we need a good night.
It’s still the best night of. the
week,.”’

SAB Chairman Burford Smith
said the first two Wednesday
nights in the Pit were ‘‘not tre-
mendously well attended,’ but
that this is ‘‘not that far out of
line’ with the last couple of
years.

Smith cited a more strenuous
fraternity Rush this fall, which
kept some students (including
SAB members) occupied, as
well the failure of the SAB to
adequately publicize the new
band night, especially at neigh-
boring girls’ schools, as factors
in the decline.

Rush and lack of publicity
were also reasons for decreased
attendance stated by Cockpit
manager Chris Brooks. He feels,
though, that it is still too early to
tell how the new schedule will af-
fect the entire year. He does say
that it ‘looks like (the Cockpit)
will be hurt a bit.’”’ Nonethleless,
he is optimistic. ‘‘I think we can
have more successful nights.”’

Along with the drop in atten-
dance, Smith said that the ven-
ture is losing money. He put
losses at about $300 per week
thus far. This is, he said, a pro-
blem common to the beginning
of the year.

“‘discretion of the registrar.”’

She said the primary con-
sideration is ‘‘intent’”’ Whether
the student plans to remain in
the county for an_ indefinite
period of time.

Other factors that may be used
in determining residency, the of-
ficials said, include: location of

‘banking accounts, address on

driver’s license, jurisdiction in
which vehicles are licensed and
registered, degree of economic
independence and freedom from
parental control.

“‘We have some law students”’
who can vote locally, Mrs. Burch
said, “‘because they are mar-
ried, they have a home here,
they participate in community
activities, they drive with a
Virginia driver’s license, they
have Virginia tags, they pay tax-
es, their children are in school
here.’’.

Both the Lexington and Rock-
bridge offices say they will
assist students who wish to
receive an absentee ballot.

For Virginia residents, there
is a simple form that can be
completed and mailed back to
the student’s home city or coun-

ty.

320 choose drop/add

SaaS a EE NRE TTA NE TRAINER
By MICHAEL LONGSHORE

 

Fall term registration saw 320
Washington and Lee _ under-
graduates change their sch-
edules through the Drop/Add
program and 77 upperclassmen
choose to accept a Pass/Fail
grade in an elective course.

University Registrar Harold
S. Head said that the Drop/Add
Statistic, which remained vir-
tually unchanged from last year,
is low compared with most pri-
vate schools. Head expressed
some surprise, though, at the
number of students opting for
the Pass/Fail grade, which
dropped from 133 in fall term
last year to 77 this year, a reduc-
tion of almost 58 percent.

School policy for Drop/Add, as
outlined in the University cata-
logue, requires the approval of a
class change by both the stu-
dent’s faculty adviser and the
appropriate department head as
well as payment of $5. Head
noted that the money defrays the
cost of the forms involved in the
process, the computer work re-

uired and the more than 30
man-hours of overtime work in-

 

_ing to Head. The Pass/Fail

cluded in this phase of registra-
tion. Several years ago, the
University attempted to place a
restraint on the number of
students using the services of
Drop/Add by raising the fee to
$10. This policy was unsucces-
sful, though, and W&L since has
reverted to the $5 fee.

The Pass/Fail option, avail-
able to students from the sopho-
more level up, allows the in-
dividual to receive a grade of
Pass or Fail in an elective
course not counting towards his
major. Head said he feels that
the attitude of the students,
predominantly seniors, who par-
ticipate in the program is that a
teacher would not dare fail
them, especially in the winter or
spring term. The oft-touted psy-
chological advantage of
Pass/Fail is misleading, accord-

course is just as difficult as any
regular course, ‘‘and work is
graded on the same basis,’’ he
added.

Head attributed the decline in
the Pass/Fail option to the view
professional schools take of such
classes and the more serious at-
titude among students.

Dads take first step

on the road

 

By DAVE DONAHUE
Music Critic

 

Generally, the release of a
band’s debut album on a major
label heralds a big New York
party, with all its associated
trappings, an opening spot dn a
headliner’s tour and, especially
in the past few years, a man-
datory video with overblown
poses and technical gimmickry.

The Dads, a four-man band
from Richmond, celebrated on a
smaller scale this past Sunday
night, the eve of the release of
their self-titled album, by throw-
ing a party in their hometown for
their friends. Afterward, it was
back on the local circuit of bars,
college gyms and fraternity
houses. No studio recluses or
MTV mirages here — they work
out on the rock and roll fun-
damentals.

You won’t hear them com-
plaining, though. They have
forged their sound through three
years of nearly non-stop touring
up and down the East Coast.
Equally at home pounding out
‘‘Twist and Shout’’ and their
Stevie Wonder tribute, ‘Up-
tight,”’ they’ve also added their
own variations on other covers,

A Russian-language feature
film series will begin tonight
with a showing of ‘‘Alexander
Hevsky”’ at 7:30 p.m. in Room
327 of the Commerce School.
This 107-minute film is a
recreation of the Teutonic
Knights’ invasion of Russia in
1242 and glorifies the history-
changing role of single events
—especially the Battle on Ice (on
frozen Lake Peipus) that mark-
ed the Knights’ downfall. It
reflects Moscow’s early (1937)

to fame

most noticeably a space-reggae
version of Bobby Fuller’s “I
Fought the Law.”

Yet their passion is their own
music, and the songs they’ve
written, such as ‘‘Imagination,”’
“Do What you Wanna,’ and
“Rhythm Master,’’ hold their
own alongside the older classics.
Their sets have become more
polished, and the move from
cramped fraternity houses and
overcrowded bars to larger
stages is inevitable.

The album itself gives no in-

dication of the fullness and .

diversity of their sounds onstage
— a three-minute song may have
a long introduction, and _in-
strumental jams may pop up at
any time. They have jelled as a
working unit — Bryan Harvey’s
thumping, rumbling bass, Kevin
Pittman’s rhythm guitar and
organ, David Ayers’ multi-
textured lead guitar and Michael
Tubb’s rock (and roll) steady
drumming.

Vocals are their strongest suit,
with Bryan and Kevin alterna-
ting leads and David contribu-
ting backups. The band has
balance and self-confidence, aid-
ed by Victor Benshoff’s always
able and integral sound mixing,
and their live performances are

decision to prepare society
through cinema for the coming
war with Germany, and for the
revival of pre-revolutionary
themes.

Directed by Sergei Eisenstein,
it reflects his un-Marxist switch
from masses to individuals as
the heroes in his works.

will include four additional films
throughout the semester. Each
film mirrors a particular period
of Soviet history:

energetic and always interest-
ing.

They were able to reproduce
this “‘live’’ sound for the album,
thanks in large part to their pro-
ducer, Paul Leka (who is also
president of their label, the CBS
affiliate Estate). Recorded in a
week in a Connecticut studio, the
album has a minimum of over-
dubs and studio trickery, al-
though the band did take a more
active part in engineering side
two than side one, which basical-

ly set down songs they have had
in their repertoire for a while.
“Man With Machinery’ and
“Four Walls’’ give an indication
of even better things to come on
their (let’s hope) second album.

To get that album, however,
they must continue to do what
they’ve been doing — tour and
promote the album around Vir-
ginia and North Carolina. If they
can prove to the label that they
can sell their record, then they

get a bigger boost.

For now (fortunately for us)
we can catch them at fraternity
houses and college pubs, and
wonder at how long it will be
before they burst on the national

‘Karate Kid’ worth seeing

 

By TIM McMAHON
Movie Critic

 

How does the proverbial ‘‘new
kid on the block’ turn from
“‘picked-on Pete’”’ to black-belt,
win the heart of the best looking
girl in class and wind up face-to-
face with her (also) black-belted
boyfriend? The answers to these
questions are revealed in ‘‘The
Karate Kid,” a well paced, en-
tertaining, if somewhat pre-
dictable, movie being held over
for another week at the Lyric in
Lexington.

After moving from New Jer-
sey to southern California, the
“new kid,’ played by Ralph
Macchio, undergoes a pretty
rough adjustment period, spend-
ing half his time dodging a gang

of bullies, led by his new girl’s
ex. Nearly beaten to a pulp one
night, he decides to fight back,
and with the help of an old care-
taker (Pat Morita Arnold from
‘Happy Days’’), who just hap-
pens to know karate, he learns
not only the skills to fight back
using karate, but also the spirit
behind karate.

Central to this picture is the
relationship between Macchio’s
and Morita’s characters. The
boy has no father; the man no
son. Director John G. Avildsen
takes Robert Mark Kamen’s
script and gives each actor plen-
ty of room to work with, and both
come across well. I was particu-
larly impressed with Morita,
who showed much more depth
(and restraint) in this role than
he did serving Richie and Potsy
hamburgers on ‘‘Happy Days.”

There is something mysterious
about his character, almost
unbelievable, yet he also has a
human side, displayed realisti-
cally in a scene taking place on
his would-be anniversary, and
Morita carries it off extremely
well,

One other point, which was a
big plus, in my opinion, is the
way that Avildsen ends this
movie on an extremely high
note. The emotion reaches a
pitch, and he leaves it there, so
the audience can walk out feel-
ing good, rather than pondering
some explanation after the
climax. He used a similar tech-
nique at the end of another of his
memorable movies, ‘‘Rocky.”’

All in all, despite its predic-
tability, ‘‘The Karate Kid”
works. It is a movie worth see-
ing.

history. An extraordinarily pop-
ular work, the film consists
almost entirely of a lengthy din-
ner conversation between play-
wright-actor Wallace Shawn and
avant-garde theater director An-
dre Gregory.

Richard Grefe, faculty adviser
to the W&L Film Society, said
that ‘“‘unpromising premise de-
velops into an exchange sparkl-
ing with ideas and experiences.”

Watercolors displayed

An exhibition of watercolors
by Chinese-born artist Dora Lee
will go on display in Washington
and Lee’s duPont Gallery Oct. 1.

DuPont Gallery is open from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Satur-
day and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
Admission is free. The exhibition
will remain on view through Oct.
19.

The artist will present a lec-
ture/demonstration at 7:30 p.m.
Thursday, Oct. 4, in Room 9 of
Newcomb Hall. The lecture is
sponsored by the University lec-
tures committee, and is open to
the public.

A reception in Ms. Lee’s honor
will be held from 5 p.m. to7 p.m.
Friday, Oct. 5, in duPont Gal-
lery. That event also is open to
the public.

Born in Peking, Ms. Lee stud-
ied under the tutelage of Yen
Shao-hsaing and the traditional
master Chao Men-Chu. Later,
while living in Japan, she
became the student of one of
China’s great literati painters,
Prince PuJu.

She has lived in Washington,

D.C., since 1957 and has studied
sculpture there with Pietro Laz-
zari.

Her work provides an excel-
lent example of the fusion of two
cultures, the East and the West.

Although she continues to
draw upon traditional Chinese
themes, Ms. Lee also paints
Western subjects with an a-
wareness of Western traditions.

Her work is contained in the
collections of the Smithsonian
Institution, the Museum of
Natural History, the China In-
stitute of New York and the Na-
tional Cathedral in Washington.

She has given several ~“o-
person exhibitions, both in the
Washington area and in New
York City, and has won 42
awards in both painting and
sculpture.

Ms. Lee teaches Chinese tradi-
tional painting and calligraphy
privately in Washington. She
also teaches calligraphy at
George Washington University
and Chinese traditional painting

With new pavilion, SAB plans better bands

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

With the availability of better
facilities in the new student ac-
tivities pavilion, the W&L com-
munity soon will be able to enjoy
bigger and better bands, the Stu-
dent Activity Board’s John Hay-
wood said this week.

The Motown group, the Spin-
ners, will be the main attraction
at the grand opening of the
pavilion Oct. 12, Friday night of
Homecoming weekend.

This weekend also will include
a Sunday afternoon party at the
pavilion featuring the
SpongeTones, who performed
during last year’s Fancy Dress
weekend.

The Spinners are the first in a
list of bands — including the
Ramones, Stevie Ray Vaughan
and Scandal — the SAB feels

able to consider for social func-
tions at Washington and Lee
when the pavilion becomes fully
operational in January.

“‘We have the facilities now to
book big bands,’”’ Haywood said.
‘“‘We’ve always had the funds,”’
he emphasized, ‘‘now we have
the facilities.”’

When the SAB tried to book the
popular group Big Country for
Fancy Dress weekend, adequate
facilities were not available.

Haywood said ‘that if the
pavilion had been in use then,
Big Country would have played.

‘“‘We used to have to run bands
off about 100 amps,’’ he said.
“‘Now we have about 600 to 800
amps.”

In the past, Haywood said, the
SAB would be able to use Evans
Dining Hall once a year and
Warner Center once a year,
“‘and then we’d have to get down

September dry in area

A lack of rainfall in the Lex-
ington area this month has left
layers of dust and dirt on cars
and caused students to seek

relief in air conditioned
buildings.
The first 25 days of September

brought 1.22 inches of rain tc
Roanoke, according to the Na-
tional Weather Service there.
Roanoke’s normal September
rainfall is 3.42 inches.

Most of this September’s rain
occurred Sept. 3, when 1.12 in-
ches fell. An additional .04 in-

ches fell Sept. 5 and .06 inches
Sept. 14.

The lack of rain is caused by a
series of high pressure systems
that have dominated the area’s
weather during the past few
weeks, ‘‘Generally, we do have
quite a few dry days in the fall,”’
a National Weather Service
observer said. “Its nothing
unusual.”

A slight chance of showers was
forecast for today. Tempera-
tures are expected to be in the
mid 70s.

on our knees and beg to use the
athletic field,’ he added.

Now that the pavilion is being
built, Haywood said he expects
to see more entertainment for
the community, with the pa-
vilion being used for University-
wide activities Friday nights
and fraternity activities Satur-
day nights.

The higher quality entertain-
ment will be reflected in an add-
ed cost to students, though, SAB
President Burford Smith said
while explaining his group’s
budget request to the Executive
Committee Tuesday night.

“The entertainment out there
(in the pavilion) will be of higher
quality or be a national act,”
Smith said, ‘“‘so we expect to
charge higher ticket prices.”

In its budget request, the SAB
gave a projected need of $81,270,
but requested only $53,250.
Wednesday night, the EC award-
ed it $42,450.

‘“‘The more money we start out
with,’ said Smith, defending his
request, “‘the less money we
have to charge at the door.”

Admission to the Spinners will
be $5, with the entire show
costing over $15,000, twice as

much as last year’s Homecom-
ing weekend.

“This will be the first show in
the pavilion,” Smith added, ‘‘so
we felt justified to put forth a lit-
tle more, since (the pavilion)
will not be used in the fall.”

After Homecoming weekend,
the pavilion will be closed until
January, when the building will
be finished.

The rest of the SAB’s schedule
has not been set, except for the
Fancy Dress Ball March 8.
Tickets for the ball will be $30,
the same as last year, Haywood
said.

‘‘We won’t be looking at the
winter schedule until Novem-
ber,’’ Haywood said, ‘‘and that’s
when we'll start coordinating
with the girls’ schools.”

Lecture scheduled Oct. 4

James M. Cox, Avalon Pro-
fessor of English at Dartmouth
College, will deliver the third an-
nual Shannon-Clark Lecture in
English at Washington and Lee
next Thursday, Oct. 4.

His lecture, entitled ‘‘ ‘Adven-
tures of Huckleberry Finn’: A
Hard Book to Take,”’ is schedul-
ed for 8 p.m. in Northen Audi-
torium of the University Li-
brary. The lecture is open to the
public.

A native of Virginia, Cox holds
degrees from the University of
Michigan and Indiana Universi-
ty. He is editor of ‘“‘Robert Frost:
Twentieth Century Views” and
author of ‘Mark Twain: The

Fate of Humor’ and of nume-
rous essays on a wide range of
American writers.

The Shannon-Clark Lectures
in English were inaugurated two
years ago at Washington and
Lee by Edgar F. Shannon Jr.,
Commonwealth Professor of
English at the University of
Virginia and a W&L alumnus.
The series honors the memories
of his father, chairman of the
Washington and Lee English
department from 1914 until 1938,
and Harriet Mabel Fishburn
Clark, a grandmother of the
donor whose gift to W&L estab-
lished the lecture series.

 

Violations

that were blatantly broken.

“During Rush, you heard so
much that you can take all the
rumors with a grain of salt. Rush
was so short and different that
there was a lot of confusion — we
need fewer and more related
regulations.’’

Gray Sanders, president of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said there
were numerous unspoken under-
standings among the houses dur-
ing Rush.

“T think this Rush was cleaner
than in the past, but you don’t
want to turn anybody else in

 

because they could probably
turn you in, too,” he explained.

“Fraternities can sympathize
with their biggest rivals,’ he
continued. ‘‘And your biggest
rivals are usually the most like
you, so you don’t want to turn
them in — it’s definitely a last
resort,

“If you get turned in, more
than likely you got a lot more of
the guys that the other house
wanted.”

Jim Cobb, president of Phi
Kappa Sigma, felt more strongly
about the problems of dirty
Rush.

“‘T heard guys in this house say
that they had heard about viola-
tions,” he said. ‘“The one thing I
knew about with some other peo-

ple — the fact that the SAEs had
a Sunday band I took to the I.C.”’

‘‘Rush is over before anything
would be done about the viola-
tion. If the fraternity were to get
probation, it’s after Rush, so it
doesn’t hurt them. Generally,
though, the houses wouldn’t
want to turn somebody in for
smaller violations.”’

Jeff Boswell, president of Kap-
pa Alpha, particularly felt that
this had been a dirty Rush.

“I definitely don’t fee) that it
was a Clean Rush,’’ he asserted.
“‘T think a lot of houses didn’t
want to turn each other in.
Fraternities have, in general,
felt this year like they had to
abide by the rules now — they
feel the pressure from the Hill.”’

no clear policy on blacks emerg-
ed. Responses to this question
ranged from “Are you kidding
me?”’ to “If the guy is a solid in-
dividual, there should be no pro-
blem.”

Various members of SABU in-
terviewed at Lee House II, or the
Minority Cultural Center, all
said they felt an underlying
degree of tension. Eroll Skyers
said he didn’t think he needed to

have to feel uncomfortable to
join a fraternity and decided not
to go through Rush. Others
echoed his sentiments.

Calvin Rankin added that
“everything the fraternity had
to offer could also be found
within SABU or at Lee House.”’

The common consensus was
that it was easier to just go and
see friends at the various houses
than to have to subject oneself to
a feeling of inferiority due to
skin color.

Alpha Phi Alpha, a_national
black fraternity, in February
1974, according to Dan N. Mur-
phy, associate dean of students
for fraternity affairs. Although
11 students were initiated into
the chapter when its charter was
granted, the chapter only lasted
about two years because it could
not meet a minimum member-
ship requirement established by
the national fraternity.

Murphy added that the ad-
ministration ‘‘encouraged Rush
for any black student who feels
comfortable with the Rush pro-
cess.”’

All the minorities interviewed
as well as Dean White said they
felt a black fraternity was not
the answer. The problem is that
there just aren’t enough blacks
to sustain a chapter. Everyone
would have to be accepted,
destroying the whole idea of
choice within a fraternity. Yet,
all of them encouraged black
freshmen to go through Rush,
even if they did have to put up
with the Abduls and Moham-
meds of the world.

Kickers’ mark

goes to 1-3

Re Tat ER ES RLM
By MICHAEL McALLISTER

Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team captured its first win of
the season Saturday but was
turned back for its third defeat
Tuesday.

The Generals soundly de-
feated visiting Averett Satur-
day, 3-1. Their turnaround was
cut short, however, with a 5-2
loss at Mary Washington Tues-
day.

Coming off a disastrous open-
ing weekend in which they were
outscored 16-1. the Generals

Gridders

needed a strong performance in
their home-opener against
Averett. And a strong perfor-
mance was what they got as they
were able to control play on both
ends of the field.

Goalie Jay Werner remarked,
‘“‘We were a completely different
team (Saturday) than we were
at Emory.”

The visiting Averett squad,

although tied with W&L at the ©

half 1-1, could not keep pace with
the Generals’ team play.

Statf erat

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team dropped its second
consecutive game Saturday
against Centre College 27-12.

The Generals were ineffective
offensively in the first three
quarters, allowing the Colonels
to build an insurmountable 27-0
lead entering the fourth quarter.

Centre scored its first points o
the contest on a 30-yard field
goal in the first quarter. The Col-
onels put the game out of reach
in the second quarter scoring 22
points on a pair of 1-yard scoring
runs by Meredith Evans, a 1-
yard touchdown run by quarter-
back Mike Hall and a two-point
conversion. Centre led the
Generals 25-0 at halftime.

The Colonels increased their
lead to 27-0 in the third quarter
when W&L quarterback Bobby
Wilson was sacked in the end
zone for a safety.

The Generals were able to post

two fourth-quarter touchdowns,
but it was too little too late.
Tailback Gene Girard scored on
a 5-yard pass from Wilson, and
freshman reserve quarterback
Mark Oluvic ran four yards for
the second W&L score, making
the final score 27-12.

W&L totaled 234 yards of of-
fense for the game against Cen-
tre. However, most of this yard-
age came in the fourth quarter
after the outcome of the game
had already been decided.

Girard led the Generals with
73 yards rushing and five pass
receptions. Wilson completed six
of his 20 passes for 70 yards and
one touchdown.

“I was very disappointed in
every aspect of our game,”’ said
W&L head coach Gary Fallon.
“We are becoming very frus-
trated and have begun to put
pressure on ourselves. However,
we have not given up and will
turn the season around soon.’’

“Centre’s kicking game kept
us pinned deep in our own ter-
ritory, and when we could not
move the ball, they got it back in
good field position. We couldn’t
maintain any ball control which
put a lot of pressure on our
defense,”’ Fallon said. “In the
second half we regained a little
poise, but by then the game was
out of reach.”

The Generals (1-2) play host to
Randolph-Macon this Saturday
in an important Old Dominion
Athletic Conference game for
both teams. Randolph-Macon is
2-1 on the season.

“Randolph-Macon is a very
explosive team (32.3 points per
game average), so we will have
to get fired up and get back to
basics. We must get our offense
in gear and put together some
drives in order to keep their of-
fense off the field,’’ Fallon said.

The list of injured General
players continued to grow after
the Centre game. Defensive
tackles Alex Castelli and Mark
Weaver, linbacker James
Cockey and nose guard Jim
Lyall, all starters, sustained in-
juries against Centre. Backup
quarterback Jon Thornton also
was injured in the game. The
status of these players for the
Randolph-Macon game still is
undecided.

“T felt like I was watching
M*A*S*H,” Fallon said about
his team’s injuries against Cen-
tre.

Boxing: The Rocky story is just that—a story

TIME

By Mike
Stachura

 

 

....ven though he has been
pronounced as out of the danger
of ‘Parkinson’s syndrome,”
Muhammad Ali — the man who
personified to our generation

' that mysterious yet alluring
sport known as professional box-
ing — has given us all a scare
and perhaps a fearful realization
that the sport whose heroes we
had stood in awe of was some-
thing we should have left behind

with all those other archaic tests
of courage (read: stupidity).

The stories of the past cham-
pion and the great bouts that
may have been just another 40
punches too many that came out

in the past week cause one to
wonder about this once revered
test of men and manhood. Dave
Anderson, the sports columnist’s
columnist, paints an all too sad
— yet all too realistic portrait of
the once and future king of the
ring: ‘‘For more than two years

ed, but practically, its banning
can never occur. He writes,
“‘Boxing needs to be governed
better, much better. But boxing
is like sin. It’s too popular to be
abolished.”’

Boxing constantly piques a
spectator’s interest. It is our

now, Ali has been talking like a
man who was 80, his words cling-
ing together like cobwebs of
dust.”’ Anderson asks the ques-
tion that everyone has been ask-
ing for too long, ‘‘Should boxing
be banned?”’

Anderson’s answer is evasive,
yet it is the only answer. he said

ideally, boxing should be bann-

W&L golf coach Buck Leslie

to see how the players fare under
competitive conditions.

Low score for the Generals
was shot by Greg Wheeler,
whose rounds of 76 and 75 gave
him a match total of 151.
Freshmen Chip Gist and Andy

Leslie as standouts in the tourna-
ment.

The W&L-VMI Invitational is

animalistic nature that makes
us slaver in front of our televi-
sions as two of God’s wiser
creatures attempt to beat each
other senseless.

If you are able to step back
from ESPN or HBO the next
time a fight is broadcast, you
will see — regrettably, let us
hope — what fools we are. Let’s

 

face it. Boxing is a ridiculous
sideshow of where the rational
man has veered off course. One
need only look at the deteriora-
tion of its participants to see that
fact.

The Rocky story is just that, a
story. What Muhammad Ali has
gone through and will go through
is not. Perhaps now that we are
faced with just how detrimental
this sport can be, we will be wise
enough to control it before it is
allowed to deteriorate further...

Coach Gary Fallon sees frustra-

for turnaround, but note: R-MC
will be very tough....

.... Taking a casual glance at
the rest of the football world,

Polo looks to finish second

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee
water polo team suffered four
losses last weekend at the
Southeastern Invitational in An-
napolis, Md., but head coach
Page Remillard isn’t discourag-
ed. Remillard said, ‘‘We have to
take the weekends and put
everything together for the end
of the season.”’

The Generals (2-6-1) lost to
Brown, 20-1, Navy, 21-1, Buck-
nell, 12-1, and Slippery Rock,
17-6. Each team rates among the
nation’s top 20 and Brown and
Navy are members of the top 10.

Remillard, citing Bobby Pear-
son and Tim Stanford for their
outstanding performance last
weekend, said, ‘‘They could play
for any team.’’ Remillard views
the last two weekends of com-

petition as quizzes for his team.
‘“‘We try to take the weekends
and find out how effective our
coaching methods are,’’
Remillard said.

In these quizzes, Remillard
said he concentrates on what his
team needs to improve and not
necessarily the score, but added,
‘“‘We’re very cognizant of the
scores.”

Remillard said, “We could
have worked on scoring more
goals but that would not benefit
us at the end of the season.”

“We did have scoring pro-
blems, but primarily we were
working on other things,’ he
said.

Remillard used much of the
weekend to give experience to
many of his freshmen and sopho-
mores. He also worked on team
defense, which he said he
believes is improving.

Remillard also said that his
goalies have improved. Goalie

Kevin Davidson is injured and is
questionable for this weekend’s
competition. Currently, Jeff
Cohen is playing shall-end goalie
and Charlie Groh defends the
deep-end goal.

Referring to previous competi-
tion as quizzes, Remillard labels
this weekend’s competition a
mid-term when the Generals
host the State Tournament.

W&L’s first game is at 10 a.m.
Saturday in Cy Twombly Pool.

Southern League powerhouse
Richmond, along with Lynch-
burg, Hampden-Sydney, VMI,
Virginia Commonwealth and
James Madison, will be par-
ticipating in the tournament,

Viewing the implications of
this weekend’s competition,
Remillard said, ‘‘If we are going
to contend for the conference
championship we need to finish
second in the state,’ and con-
cluded, ‘‘If we are on our course,
we should finish in the top two.”’

Mark Sullivan, one of the team’s
captains, scored the winning
goal on a penalty shot. Other
leaders on the day for W&L in-
cluded forward Eric Obeck, who
scored the team’s first goal and

senior midfielder Gary
Clements, who got the assist on
Obeck’s head-in goal.

Piranian said the Generals
never really got things going
against the Scots, falling behind
early in the contest.

For their efforts, Sullivan and
Clements were named ‘Players
of the Game” by their team-
mates.

Coach Rolf Piranian said he
was pleased with the team’s
turnaround.

“The guys showed a lot of
character after the season-
opening disaster,’’ Piranian
said. ‘I hope this is the team ef-
fort that we can build on.”’

Unfortunately, Piranian’s

Last Saturday the Washington
and Lee cross country team
quickly became 2-0. Living up to
last week’s prediction of co-
captain Frank Pittman, the
Generals defeated both Mary
Washington and Washington Col-
lege at Mary Washington.

A Mary Washington runner
captured first place in 27
minutes and 34 seconds, just one
second ahead of junior Eddie
Goundry. The next six finishers
were also Generals. They were:
senior Frank Pittman (28:24),
freshman Bill Calhoun (29:27),
senior Gordon Ogden (29:30),
sophomore Ash _ Andrews
(29:40), freshman Richard
Moore (29:40), and freshman
Scott Rippeon (29:48).

As fraternity Rush comes to
an end, a new activity emerges:
Intramural sports.

Coach Verne Canfield,
assisted by senior Mike Hudson,
directs the intramural program.

The first three events this year
are tennis, football and golf.
Tennis was postponed from
Tuesday until Sunday due to un-
expected delays in the comple-
tion of the lower tennis courts.
The season will end with the
completion of playoffs Oct. 25.

Football started Tuesday and
will be played through Oct. 11.
Sixteen teams are expected to
participate.

was Washington & Lee 20, Mary
Washington 53 and Washington
College 66. If this had been a
dual meet versus either team,
W&L would have racked up a
20-43 victory over Mary Wash-
ington and a 15-50 devastation of
Washington college. The first
Washington College runner
finished in 11th place.

“T am very pleased with our
performance,”’ said Coach Rich-
ard Miller. “It is very early in
the season, but I am encouraged
by the way we ran on a mode-
rately difficult course.”’

“We will
harder because of our previous
victory,” said senior Ken Moles,
‘but we also feel fairly confi-
dent.’”’ This Saturday the Gene-
rals have a tri-meet in Salem
with Norfolk State University
and the ODAC champions,
Roanoke College.
