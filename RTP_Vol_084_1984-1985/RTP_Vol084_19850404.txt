Faculty studies proposed drug rules

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Possession or use of drugs would not be an
offense punishable by the University under a
proposed disciplinary policy being reviewed
by the faculty. The report says such regula-
tions are ‘‘impractical.”’

Distribution of drugs or possession of drugs
with intent to distribute them, however, would
be offenses under new Student Control Com-
mittee guidelines contained in the proposal.

The recommendations are included in the
report of the Drug Policy Review Committee,
formed in September by University President
John D. Wilson at the request of the Board of
Trustees.

The 30-page report will be voted on by the
faculty before it is submitted, possibly with
revisions, to the trustees next month.

“However much we want the student to
eschew drug use,’’ the report says, ‘‘we could
find no basis...for punishing a student for an
act committed in private, behind closed doors,
and which does not result in any of the behav-
ior already subject to disciplinary sanctions.”

Head Dormitory Counselor Bob Tomaso,
one of three student members of the commit-
tee and the only member to oppose the com-
mittee’s drug recommendation, wrote in a

. f ¥

strongly worded dissent that not penalizing
drug use would put dormitory counselors ‘‘in
an impossible situation.”

Other highlights of the proposal include a
distinction between ‘‘major’’ and ‘“‘minor’’ of-
fenses under the jurisdiction of Student Con-
trol and a number of changes in the proce-
dures of Student Control.

A minority report by Dean of Students Lewis
G. John and two other professors urges addi-
tional faculty involvement in the student disci-
plinary system.

The 10-member committee was composed of
six professors, John and three students — Pete
Baumgaertner, Darby Brower and Tomaso.

What Happens Next?: Psychology Pro-
fessor Leonard E. Jarrard, who chaired the
committee, said he expects a final reeommen-
dation to be adopted at the May 6 faculty meet-
ing so it can be presented to the trustees at
their May 24-25 meeting. He said a special
meeting of the faculty may have to be called to
discuss the proposal.

Wilson sent the report to the faculty and the
student body Executive Committee last week,
and Jarrard said he made a 20-minute presen-
tation of the recommendations at Monday’s
faculty meeting.

A meeting of the Faculty Discussion Club,
which meets occasionally for informal discus—
sion of issues of concern to professors, is

eeiiahiememiinimerteen: execneceesiess ceeatiee eee

scheduled for the first week of spring term.

“Some of the recommendations will meet
witha lot of controversy with the faculty,”’ Jar-
rard said. ‘‘To get agreement is going to re-
quire much discussion and consideration.”’

Jarrard declined to discuss specifics of the
report. ‘I can’t talk about particulars now
with the faculty just getting involved,’”’ he
said.

The report suggests implementation of the
recommendations for a trial period of three
years, after which the system would be re-
evaluated.

Drugs—The Committee’s View: The report
specifically points out that possession or use of
drugs is not included on the suggested list of
offenses.

The committee said that present University
regulations against drug use ‘‘operate in ways
that are capricious, discriminatory and con-
trary to our stated policy.”

“To those who might argue that our discipli-
nary system should discourage unwanted be-
havior, and drug use is certainly unwanted be-
havior,’’ the report says, ‘‘we answer that we
would also want just as much to discourage
such behavior as drunkenness and smoking to-
bacco, but using the disciplinary system to ac-
complish any of these ends seems impracti-
chi.”

Because the University does not specifically

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

penalize an act does not mean it condones it,
the report claims.

Drugs—Tomaso’s View: Tomaso vehement-
ly dissented from the committee consen-
sus, writing in a minority report that the pro-
posed drug regulations ‘‘may backfire’ and
would lead to ‘‘increased rowdiness in the dor-
mitories.”’

He said a defect of the plan is that students
would be ‘‘allowed to use drugs in the dormi-
tories when very few members of the commu-
nity are actually willing to allow such behav-
i0f.”

“It leaves a dorm counselor in a position
where he allows ‘non-disruptive personal drug
use,’ yet is forced to draw the line on when to
interfere,’’ he continued. ‘This is a most dif-
ficult task for even a professional drug counse-
lor.”’

“While I stress the fact that I am not person-
ally opposed to individuals who choose to ex-
periment with drugs, I ask the potential endor-
sers of this statement to consider the conse-
quences of allowing personal drug use in the
dormitories,’ Tomaso wrote.

“It is not in the best interests of Washington
and Lee.”’

Offenses: The committee recommended
that matters under the jurisdiction of the Stu-
dent Control Committee be classified as ‘‘mi-

Psychology Professor David G. Elmes remembers a

 

It’s last-ditch-effort time. Both teachers and students
try to telescope 12 weeks of classes into,one week of
finals. For some students, just taking the exam is not
enough, These are the ones who insist on writing little

notes to the professor at the end of the exam.

For instance, English department Chairman Sidney
M.B. Coulling received quotations from a particular
Robert Browning piece. ‘‘Ah, but a man’s reach should

exceed his grasp,/Or what’s a heaven for?”’

“It is a way of suggesting, ‘I tried, so grade me on my
efforts,’ ’’ Coulling said. ‘‘Of course, there is some merit

inthatidea.”’

Philosophy department Chairman Harrison J. Pem-
berton found a special note on part of a Meaning and Ex-

istence (Philosophy 251) exam.

“‘T had the class write a one-page term paper for their
exam and they had to pledge that it was the best work
they could possibly do,’’ Pemberton recalled. ‘‘One stu-
dent wrote and signed the pledge and put that if it was

not true, may lightning strike him down.

“What made the pledge particularly interesting was

 

somewhat different kind of student response toanexam.

“I had a student flip out once and answer the Psycho-
logy 102 exam with Religion 102 answers,” he said.

“But according to the religion department the an-
swers would not have been right there either.”

Elmes jokingly added that it would take an awful lot to
influence his grading. ‘‘I have not been offered a Rolls
Royce yet,’’ he said. “‘I think would need the keys and
the title, first.”

Mathematics Professor Robert S. Johnson also re-
members a student taking a completely different ap-
proach toanexam.

“This is from years ago, and he didn’t do any of the
problems on the exam.” he said,

‘“‘The student wrote about a four- or five-page note and
started asking for a ‘D.’ He was just certain that God
would bless me if I could find it in the goodness of my
heart to give hima ‘D.’

‘After three pages, he had so convinced himself of his
case that he changed his story. Instead of asking for a
‘D,’ he asked for a ‘C.” ”’

“‘Of course,’ Johnson said, ‘“‘the guy got an ‘F.’ ”’

Brown worked for W&L from 1971
to 1976. While at the University, she
developed a_ bibliographical _ re-
sources course, served as chairman
of the board of publishers of W&L’s
literary journal, Shenandoah, and in
1976, received a Ring-tum Phi award,
which recognizes faculty, staff and
students who have made significant
contributions to the University com-
munity.

“She is a very well-trained libra-
rian,”’ said Dean of the College John
W. Elrod, chairman of the eight-per-
son search committee. ‘‘She has ex-
cellent training in library science.
She has the experience of being a li-
brarian in outstanding libraries.”’

Brown, who said she’s been back to
Lexington an average of once a year,
added that she was excited when
Elrod informed her last Wednesday
of her selection.

“I’m still getting adjusted to it,”
Brown said in a telephone interview.
“T was very interested in coming
back to Washington and Lee.”’

Brown, who will begin work in Ju-
ly, was on campus in February for in-
terviews and meetings with the
search committee, the library staff,
the faculty library committee, Elrod
and President John D. Wilson.

useful for us to learn from the faculty
who were here that she served this li-
brary well.... She had been a very
positive influence in the library and
onthe faculty.”’

Among plans she has for the li-
brary, Brown said, are working with
surrounding libraries to exchange in-
formation, increasing the amount of
commercial information available
for retrieval and bringing the card
catalog up todate.

that the library has is to provide good

better service.”’

mation could be used are checking in
periodicals, keeping track of when
periodicals are not received and

could use a computer to find a publi-

Cinda Rankin sees herself in a
history-making role.

Rankin, if you'll remember, |

was named assistant athletic
director at Washington and Lee in
January. Her primary responsi-
bility will lie in coordinating
women’s athletics. It is a task
whose significance and challenge
she eagerly awaits.

“| definitely see this as a his-
tory-making position, and with
that there’s going to be pressure,
although I see the pressure in a
very positive sense in that it’s
something very exciting to me,”’
she said in her office this week.

Rankin arrived at W&L last
week and is currently adjusting to

her new surroundings. ‘‘I’ve real-
ly enjoyed it so far. Of course,
we’re still on the honeymoon.”’

Well, it’s been a _ working
‘“‘honeymoon,”’ Rankin has met
with the coaches of the proposed
women’s sports teams for next
year (cross country, golf, tennis
and swimming and diving) and
has begun her duties as one of the
administrators for the NCAA Di-
vision III Tennis Championships.
W&L will serve as host for the
May 13-19 championships.

Her immediate duties also in-
clude a survey of the women ac-
cepted to W&L to find out where
their athletic interests lie. She
said that one team sport for wo-
men could be added for the 1986-87
school year.

Rankin said she likes the chal-
lenge of starting a program. ‘I

think it will be much more rewar-
ding to know that I’ll be building
and working from the ground le-
vel. Then you can look back and
say, ‘Whatever happens, be it
negative or positive, it was my
creation,’ ’’she said.

As the central figure in the
development of a women’s athle-
tic program at W&L, Rankin said
she does feel some pressure to
succeed.

“T think it’s really critical for
any program to get as healthy a
start as it can. I tend to think the
stronger you start the more likely
you are to attract other quality
athletics,’’ she said.

Nice policy

The report of the Drug Policy Review Committee issued
last week, although beginning to head in the right direction,
represents a setback in the University’s campaign against
the use of illegal substances. The report attempts to create a
policy through which the Washington and Lee disciplinary
system can deal with students found using drugs. It fails
miserably in any such feeble try.

Most disturbing of the committee’s recommendations is its
delineation of major and minor conduct offenses. Foremost,
the report struggles to distinguish between the possession of
marijuana and its sale while never quite explaining how such
a difference should be formally expressed. Are we to assume
that the University would follow legal definitions of intent ac-
cording to the amount possessed?

Further, while the committee says it wants to ‘eschew
drug use,’’ it simulataneously gives tacit approval to the
abuse of narcotic substances by saying that what goes on
behind closed doors — even on University property — is not
to be closely monitored. The logic behind such a statement is
incredible. We can only suppose that the committee also
finds no basis for punishing a student for murder — another
act deemed illegal according to society’s laws — as long as
the student commits the act behind closed doors. We are not
suggesting that a witchhunt begin to determine who is using
what, but a University policy ought to be strong enough to
take a firm stand wherever one is needed. Is the faculty un-
sure whether they disapprove of student use of illegal sub-
stances?

Although the proposed policy makes fine reference to ex-
tenuation (a student’s behavior is not excused because
he/she is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol), it falls
drastically short of any direct dealing with any preventative
action. Using any disciplinary structure at the University
level in an attempt to ‘‘discourage unwanted behavior, and
drug use is certainly unwanted behavior, we answer that we
would also want just as much to discourage such behavior as
drunkenness and smoking tobacco, but using the disciplinary
system to accomplish any of these ends seems impractical.”
Are we to follow such logic and suppose that because no
practical disciplinary structures exist we should not do
anything about our opposition to drug use? Impracticality
should not be a basis for a ‘‘yes or no”’ decision. There is a
foolish consistency to such a notion. The committee seems to
have conveniently forgotten that the current Student Control
Committee does serve as an effective medium to discourage
unwanted alcoholic misbehavior.

Later in the report, the committee decides something
scientists continue to debate. In a curious twist to its already
erratic logic, the committee decides that marijuana use is to
be deemed ‘‘less dangerous”’ than other drugs students might
use. Such a conclusion seems, again, logically untenable. To
attempt to legitimize any narcotic by labelling it as less
dangerous is at best questionable, at worse, dumb. Grades of
harm do not exist in the context of drug use just as degrees of
guilt do not exist in honor cases. Society’s laws do not
recognize a grade of illegality and neither should we.

The committee follows up its statement of the degree of
harm of drug use by piously assuring itself of the effective-
ness of its drug ‘‘educational programs.” Any attempt to ad-
dress the problem of drug use through an educational pro-
gram seems weakened if the sponsor of the program is not
willing to go on the record as actively opposed to drug use.
Will such educational programs be strengthened from their
present insipid, milquetoast state? If anything, the Universi-
ty certainly does reserve the right to tell students how they
will act while at the University. Students attend Washington
and Lee knowing that certain rules will govern their behavior
while they are here. Yet, the policy seems to say otherwise.

In a dissenting report to one section of the proposal, senior
Bob Tomaso makes a cogent argument about the commit-
tee’s report on the whole — the distinction between ‘‘non-dis-
ruptive personal drug use’’ and potentially dangerous disrup-
tive drug use is at best nebulous. The committee’s recom-
mendation that dormitory counselors be monitors for distin-
guishing between potentially dangerous drug use and safe
drug use (oxymoron?) is, again, foolish.

The report is not all worthy of criticism. Indeed, the
dissenting report urging greater faculty input into discipli-
nary proceedings seems enlightened in view of seeming cur-
rent student reluctance to punish their peers. We would urge
that the SCC stay as a wholly student group were its past
record more respectable in regard to dealing with student in-
fractions. The committee’s recognition that alcohol is the
most common drug abused on campus is another step in the
right direction. However, while they condemn the current
University alcohol policy because alcohol abuse is out of
hand, they are promoting the same potential problem with
regard to drug use. Will the University 10 years from now
condemn this drug policy because it promotes drug abuse?
We believe that is self-evident after reviewing the commit-
tee’s findings.

What must be done to prevent this policy from being enact-
ed in its original form is evident. Students ought to speak with
faculty members and let their opinions be known. Additional-
ly, faculty members ought to consider carefully the report’s
recommendations. The report seems to be facing in the right
direction. It is only a pity that it takes one step forward for
every two it takes backward.

Study may reveal bias

 

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

 

In Saturday’s edition of the
Roanoke Times & World-News, Neil
T. Pentifallo, a 1980 Washington and
Lee graduate and a former member
of the Executive Committee, wrote a
letter regarding the situation of
‘‘blacks’’ a Washington and Lee.

‘I was particularly troubled to
read that black students live in ‘great
fear’ of the honor code,’’ he writes.
“Concerns over living in ‘great fear’
are exaggerated and suggest that
students are being watched and de-
serve special treatment because of
possible discrimination. Nothing
could harm these students more,
since any preferential treatment
causes resentment by other students
and is unnecessary in the first
place.”’

I could not agree more with his
premise. History has shown that
preferential treatment given any
group, industry or race backfires in
the long run, because such special
treatment leads to atrophy and,
eventually, decay. What matters to-
day, however, is that people even
perceive that the Honor System
“does not work”’ for them. Black or
white, male or female, law student or
undergraduate — when even one per-
son believes the system has failed,
the system begins to tarnish.

Last week, we urged that next
year’s Executive Committee under-

take an extensive study of the Honor
System and survey the student body
for their opinions regarding its effec-
tiveness. We also suggested that re-
consideration of the single-sanction
rule be studied, because some faculty
members have privately voiced
reservations about its effectiveness.
Perhaps we should have added that
next year’s group ought to study any
“‘biases’’ the system may now have.
This study could begin with the White
Book Revisions Committee currently
considering modifications to the
Honor System.

With women as fellow students,
and in light of an increased effort on
the part of some University officials
to enroll more minority students,
such a study seems in order. While I
believe that the system works well
now, I also realize that there may be
certain ingrained aspects of the
White Book that could be perceived
to favor the traditional ‘‘WASPy”’
student. I am not asking for a special
“representative” to be added to the
EC just to iron out any biases that
may appear nor do I believe such
special treatment is needed. What we
must do is admit that not everyone
perceives the system as being per-
fect.

Studying the system would require
all students to contribute. Discussing
race and gender and racism.and dis-
crimination can become a_ very
sticky matter, especially with the di-
verse views present on this campus.
But that should not inhibit our at-
tempt torefine the system.

Dean paid for SCC letter

Tothe Editors: :

Two letters appeared in The Phi
last week concerning wasted student
funds. One letter came from Nelson
Patterson, the other from Joseph C.
Jefferis. I have several comments to
make in regard to these letters that
may benefit them. First, the fact that
the Student Control Committee
letterhead names two committee
officers who were running for re-
election does not bother me. These
two gentlemen earned their posi-
tions. They have served as elected
class officers for a year and there-
fore deserve any advantage which
this service may give them. The EC
members get year-round publicity of
this type, and yet I have never heard
a complaint.

Secondly, both students question
the use or abuse of money for this
mailing. If either student had taken
the time to inquire about the source
of the money used, instead of assum-
ing that it had come from student
taxes, they would have found that the
Dean’s office paid for everything. If
this were known, both students would
realize that I could not have sent out
such letters without Dean John’s con-
sent. The letter was, in fact, proofed

by Dean John and we were in agree-
ment that the individual letters
would have a greater impact on stu-
dents.

Mr. Jefferis, it is a fact that many
students are not aware of the fact
that their elected class officers are
members of the SCC. Furthermore,
too many students do not know the
detail of our responsibility. This is
also a fact, as many students who
have cases to turn in do not know
which committee handles them, and
those students brought before SCC
had no idea about our jurisdiction.
This is a concern of mine as well as
the faculty, who can revoke the re-
sponsibility of this committee at any
time. I think that the efficiency of
this year’s committee — ‘‘people of
this nature,’’ as you described us,
Mr. Jefferis — is largely responsible
for the continued respect and support
which this portion of student govern-
ment shall receive. If you can sug-
gest that myself and other members
be kept out of office, Mr. Jefferis,
then I suggest that you attempt to run
for office.

Class of 1985

Pointers for Lewis

 

John Lewis is in place, with Webb
and Caruthers at his side. We all
know Lewis’ dedication and good in-
tentions, and so in light of this year,
we have high hopes. But here are a
few thoughts that might fit well with
those other qualities.

John’s zeal and frankness in the
Big Three forum impressed me, but
also frightened me when employed
with some of his views. He adamant-
ly believes law students should not do
the ‘‘defending’’ and ‘‘prosecuting”’
with the Honor System — which
shows that he views the Honor Sys-
tem as legalistic and adversarial. Al-
though public trials are set up this
way, it is very important not to view
them this way — and especially im-
portant not to view private trials this
way. If the Honor System is seen as
rules in the White Book, then execut-
ing the Honor System comes to be us-
ing those rules — not appealing to
one’s sense of honor. Our Honor Sys-
tem’s strength lies in its non-codifi-
able nature; it is, therefore, not le-
galistic. You don’t need legal train-
ing to defend the Honor System.

John talk: »out repre-
senting the views of the students.
Unrepresented students aren’t a pro-
blem — lack of a deep understanding
of the Honor System is.

Another point about the Honor Sys-

tem, for which he can look to Cole
Dawson as a lesson, is the role of the
president in protecting absolute con-
fidentiality. ‘‘Confidentiality’’ is an
all-important catch-phrase in run-
ning the Honor System It should be
always in the EC’s mind. That our
system is totally confidential demon-
strates and expresses where our va-
lues lie — not in punishment or moral
haughtiness, but in living honorably
with honorable people. Observing
confidentiality protects the sacred
privacy of the individuals involved —
as wellasthe EC.

Please, John, learn this right
away. Earlier in the year, after a
preliminary honor investigation and

Controlling costs?

Tothe Editors:

The current controversy over the
library raises two questions that go
beyond simply whether or not to re-
tain its current hours of operation.
The first of these is how serious the
administration is in trimming the
budget, and, secondly, where the U-
niversity’s priorities lie.

If, indeed, the University is serious
about budget-cutting, several areas
come to mind where effective action
could seemingly be taken to reduce
expenses. For example, why does the
University need several photograph-
ers with complete and separate dark
room facilities? It would seem that
one such facility serving the Univer-
sity photographer would suffice.

The fleet of University cars is
another example. Obviously there is
a need for such vehicles. However,
whether or not the current number is
needed is another question, as is their
assignment to individuals for person-
al as well as school use. In addition to
their physical upkeep, these vehicles
cost a great deal toinsure,

The constant modification and re-
decoration of offices is also extreme-
ly costly, and needs to be borne in
mind, particularly since Admissions
and Development are planning up-
coming moves. Much of what is done
is nice to have, but perhaps goes
beyond what is absolutely necessary.
Travel expenses can be exorbitant,
and seem to need extra scrutiny in an
economic crunch, yet the administra-
tion has said that such considerations
are strictly off-limits. In fact, more
traveling has been recommended, re-
gardless of cost.

The new University phone system
was installed last summer ata cost of
approximately one-half million dol-
lars. One has to wonder why, when
the administration considers the
$25,000 necessary to keep the library
open at night an extravagance. If any
expense seems superfluous, the
phone system would have to be deem-
ed as such, when the old system was
perfectly capable of meeting our
needs. Unquestionably, such equip-
ment is state-of-the-art technology,
but is it justifiable in a period of
strapped finances?

This leads to consideration of the
second question, namely the priori-
ties of the University. Hopefully, aca-
demic pursuits are the primary goal

of an institution of higher learning.
The proper role of a college adminis-
tration should be to further those pur-
suits, by making sure bright and ea-
ger students are attracted to the uni-
versity, that an intellectually vibrant
faculty is retained for their instruc-
tion and that the facilities for the use
of both faculty and students are the
best they possibly canbe.

Our 24-hour library not only pro-
vides a means for furthering know-
ledge among students and faculty,
but is also an incredible attraction
which draws the attention of prospec-
tive students to Washington and Lee,
so that it clearly falls within the
bounds of academic pursuit.

If one were asked if tastefully done
offices, a fleet of cars not specifically
set aside for University use, a state-
of-the-art phone system and any
number of photo studios fell within
those same boundaries, one would be
hard pressed to answer in the affir-
mative.

And yet, when push comes to
shove, where does our administra-
tion look to make cuts? Something
seems to be wrong with our priorities
when administrators turn their eyes
immediately upon academic needs,
in this case our library, while at the
same time exempting themselves
from similar belt-tightening mea-
sures.

According to the Department of
Education, the costs of college
administrations nationwide increas-
ed a hundredfold between 1929 and
1973, and yet faculty pay increased
by only half that amount in the same
period. Apparently a_ disturbing
trend exists all over the country, one
that sees university administrators
placing their needs above those of
academics.

One hopes that such a trend is not
to be found at W&L, either now or in
the future, but the facts uf the matter
are very disturbing. If we, faculty,
student and administratron, will
keep in mind that academic excel-
lence is — and always should be —
our primary goal, then cost-cutting
becomes, if not easier, at least more
rational and sensible in approach,
leaving a university free to get on
with the business at hand, namely ed-
ucation.

No trespassing, please

Tothe Editors:

Fourteen months ago, I purchased
property in Rockbridge County
known variously as ‘‘Twin Falls,”’
“Cypress Falls,’’ ‘“‘The Blue Hole,”’
ete. This was the former property of
Mrs. Virginia P. Mackey.

It seems that Mrs. Mackey had al-
lowed students in the surrounding
area to swim and picnic on her pro-
perty at one time. The word then
spread and more and more people
began to appear without permission.
Due to her age, she was unable to
cope with the problem. The property
was and is well posted with ‘‘No Tres-
passing”’ signs. They have been total-
ly ignored, and at one count last sum-
mer there were 75 or more persons il-
legally onthe property at one time
during one day.

We spent last summer warning all
trespassers of the change in owner-
ship and the fact that they were tres-
passing. This year, we shall vigor-
ously enforce the ‘‘No Trespassing”’
restrictions on the property. This let-
ter is an effort to bring this notifica-
tion to the students and faculty of
Washington and Lee University. It is
not my intention to embarrass people
with an arrest, but I must do what
must be done to preserve my control

over my investment and what will
soon be my home.

So that there will be no mistake re-
garding the location of the property
described above, it is located along
South River and state Route 609. The
property encompasses over one mile
of river and road. Both sides of the
river belong to the property for al-
most the entire distance and along a
goodly part, both sides of the road
belong to the property. Access to the
river will be strictly forbidden unless
written permission is received first.
Access across the river or up to the
falls and into the interior of the pro-
perty will not be allowed under any
circumstances. The only other ac-
cess to the property is via Route 705
to the old Mackey house. Parking
along this road, around the farm
buildings and to either side of the
South River on property owned by
myself will result in the vehicles be-
ing towed away. It is my intention to
contact a towing service to handle
this job.

I hope that you will make an effort
to convey the above information to
all parties in order to avoid possible
conflict during this and subsequent
years.

780 are
accepted

for fall

 

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Staff Reporter

 

A total of 780 men and women have
been accepted to Washington and Lee
for the Class of 1989.

The Admissions Office mailed 670
letters of acceptance on Friday. Cou-
pled with the 110 students accepted
earlier under the Early Decision pro-
gram, this brought the breakdown of
students accepted to 623 men and 157
women.

According to admissions counselor
Bennett L. Ross, the University ex-
pects about 50 percent of those ac-
cepted to enroll in the fall for a fresh-
man class of about 400. Ross said 42
percent of those who were offered ad-
mission last year enrolled in the fall.

The record 2,639 applications for
admission to W&L this year was com-
posed of 1,941 men and 698 women,
compared with last year’s 1,502 ap-
plications.

Thirty-two percent of the male ap-
plicants were offered admission.

‘‘More women really wanted Wash-
ington and Lee as a first choice,”’
Ross said. Because a higher percen-
tage of women than men are likely to
accept their admission offer, he
explained, a lower percentage were
offered admission.

 

 

40%—

30%—

 

1966

 

 

Women comprised 35.5 percent of
the Early Decision acceptances but
only 17.6 percent of Friday’s accep-
tances.

Although the total number of appli-
cations increased by 75.7 percent
over last year, the number of stu-
dents accepted declined by 14 per-
cent.

According to Ross, the students
who were offered admission have
average SAT scores of 1,228 and are
in the 86th percentile of their respec-
tive high school classes. The average
SAT score of last year’s incoming
freshmen was 1,132.

Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington police officer who
has appealed a conviction for the as-
sault and battery of a 17-year-old has
been dismissed from the police force,

' Police Chief L.O. Sutton said.

Sgt. Richard S. Rice, 44, was dis-
missed in a letter sent by registered
mail last Wednesday. ‘‘I think the ac-
tions are legal and proper because of
the totality of the case.’’ Sutton said.

He added that Rice’s actions were
“a violation of departmental rules
and regulations.”’

“Taking any kind of disciplinary
action is never easy, but my job is to
protect the public,’’ Sutton said. ‘‘We
all have to obey laws and rules and
the police are noexception.”’

Rice no longer has any connection
with the department, according to
Sutton. ‘‘As far as I'm concerned, it’s
a moot issue,”’ he said.

In other police action last week, of-
ficers on Thursday night were called

to the Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
where an ‘‘unsanctioned party’’ was
in progress, according to Sutton.

There was ‘“‘yelling, shouting and
cursing and abuse of officers,’’ Sut-
ton said.

The president and vice-president of
Beta, George Seavy and Andrew
Cole, respectively, were issued sum-

About $1,200 worth of valuables
was taken from the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team’s locker room dur-
ing its game Sunday against Towson
State University in Towson, Md., au-
thorities said.

Nine players reported losing valu-
ables, including jewelry, watches
and cash, according to Sgt. Joseph
Herbert of the Towson State Univer-
sity Police Department’s Criminal
Investigation Division.

Percentage of Applicants
Offered Admission

1975

Eighteen percent of the accepted
students are Virginia residents, and
59 percent come from public schools,
while the remaining 41 percent are
from private schools.

Ross said his ‘‘favorite”’ statistic is
that of those applicants who were in
the top 10 percent of their classes, 42
percent were denied admission.

In addition, of those applicants who
scored 600 and above on the verbal
section of the SAT, 49 percent were
rejected, while 56 percent of those
who received scores of 600 and above
on the mathsection were rejected.

Ross said the University looks for

with Seavy and was told that ‘they
will not allow their house to get out of
line like that again.”

Sutton also met this week with Del-
ta Tau Delta President Rich Gatti to

students who can ‘‘get it all togeth-
er.”

Ross, who has held his position for
two years, said the Admissions Office
faced a ‘‘mechanical’’ problem re-
sulting from the increase of more
than 1,000 applications over last
year. He said the initial shock of the
additional paperwork was handled
quite well by the Admissions Office
secretaries.

‘We have accomplished what we
set out to do,”’ said Ross, adding that
the University probably will consider
increasing its admissions staff for
next year.

The items apparently were taken

W&L lacrosse coach Dennis Daly

locker room during halftime.

“It had to be an inside job,’’ Daly
added, ‘‘because we know it was

nor’’ or ‘‘major’’ offenses:

e“Accommodation’’ or at-cost
sales of marijuana would be a minor
offense, while ‘‘sale of marijuana for
personal profit’’ would be a major of-
fense.

eA major offense would be ‘‘posses-
sion with intent to distribute, or dis-
tribution, of an illegal form of an
opiate, amphetamine, hallucinogen
or cocaine.”’

eOther minor offenses would in-
clude ‘‘conduct disruptive to the life
of the University,’’ other schools or
the community.

eOther major offenses would in-
clude threatening or inflicting death
or bodily injury, ‘‘including death or
injury resulting from driving while
intoxicated"’; vandalism of $200 or
more; ‘‘sexual assault, included un-
wanted sexual touching’; ‘‘use of
racial, ethnic or sexual slurs’’;
“preventing the beginning or com-
pletion of a public meeting’; and
theft and fraud offenses referred to
Student Control by the EC.

ePossible penalties for minor of-
fenses would include fines, social
probation, dormitory probation and
reprimands,

eAvailable sanctions for major of-
fenses would include suspension for a
defined period and expulsion.

Student Control Procedure: ‘‘This
started out as a review of the drug
policy and ended up being a review of
Student Control,’’ said Townes Pres-
sler, incoming Student Control chair-
man.

The proposal would give additional
power to the Student Control Com-
mittee and its chairman, according
to Brower, who currently holds that
office and was a member of the drug
policy committee.

Suggestions in the report include
the institution of a student adviser
system for students brought before
Student Control.

The committee recommended that
a student have ‘‘the right to refuse to
answer any questions which may
tend to be self-incriminating.”’

The report suggests that the facul-
ty resume the disciplinary authority
it had delegated to the University
Council.

Various changes in the procedure
Student Control uses in handling
cases also are recommended, includ-
ing creation of a Certification Com-
mittee to determine whether an of-
fense is major or minor.

Alcohol: Alcohol abuse is ‘‘the
most prevalent and recurrent drug

problem on this campus [and] the
most destructive of our academic
enterprise,’’ according to the report.

The committee questions why unli-
mited pitchers of beer are sold to one
or two people at a table in the Cock-
pit, why the Dining Hall is permitted
to advertise a ‘‘Hangover Special’
breakfast for the morning after Fan-
cy Dress and why cocktail parties
are ‘‘the principal means by which
the fraternities offer hospitality to
faculty.”

Although not suggesting ‘‘a policy
of prohibition,” the committee said it
recommends a position stressing
moderation and presenting ‘“‘absti-
nence as a legitimate alternative.”

Graduation Requirements: In
response to the question, ‘‘Does the
Washington and Lee degree carry a
testimony that reaches beyond aca-
demic competence? ,’’ the committee
stated that it felt it was ‘‘inappro-
priate’ to have any graduation re-
quirements beyond these two: com-
pletion of the academic requirements
and assurance that no W&L disci-
plinary proceedings are pending
against the student.

Faculty Involvement: Although
the majority of the committee re-
commended ‘‘retention of SCC as a
wholly student group with primary,
first-instance reponsibility for decid-
ing misconduct cases and imposing
penalties,’’ John, religion Professor
Louis W. Hodges and chemistry Pro-
fessor Michael A. Pleva dissented.

The three wrote in a minority re-
port that ‘‘any judicial body with full
and final authority over discipline in
major offenses should have faculty
representatives in its membership.”

They recommended creation of a
Joint Committee on Student Disci-
pline composed of six students from
Student Control and six faculty mem-
bers elected by their colleagues.

The Background: The trustees in
May directed Wilson to form an ad
hoc committee to examine W&L’s
policy on illegal drug use.

A local special grand jury had re-
commended earlier in the month that

“develop affirmative and effective’’
anti-drug guidelines for their stu-
dents.

The confusion surrounding a case
the board dealt with in May was like-
ly another impetus for its request for
the committee.

The trustees at that meeting over-
turned a faculty recommendation
and voted to deny temporarily a
degree to William L. Dederick Jr.,
who was arrested in 1983 after com-
pleting his graduation requirements.

He was convicted of three drug-re-
lated felonies and given a 12-year
suspended sentence and 10 years of
probation,

The faculty had voted to recom-
mend that Dederick receive a diplo-
ma, but the trustees postponed con-
sideration of his degree until his
court-ordered probation ends in Dec-
ember 1993.

Following the original faculty vote,
a professor had formally requested
that the matter be reconsidered after
he learned of testimony that Deder-
ick had threatened to kill a police in-
formant. The faculty voted not to
reconsider its recommendation.

In forming the committee in
September, Wilson charged it to
‘undertake a total review of our cur-
rent policies and practices bearing
upon the institution’s response to
drug offenses.”’

Other members of the committee
were accounting Professor Jay D.
Cook Jr., associate journalism Pro-
fessor Robert J. deMaria and history
Professor Robert W. McAhren.

UC examines
85 orientation

Freshman activities proposed
to occupy time before Rush

 

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

 

The University Council on Thurs-
day discussed ways of occupying
freshman free time during orienta-
tion, since the Interfraternity Council
has proposed that be a ‘‘no contact”’
period.

The proposal to delay Rush until
the end of orientation week, which
was unanimously approved by the
IFC, must still be approved by the
Student Affairs Committee.

Neither UC nor SAC voted on the
proposal at their Thursday meetings.

Geology Professor Samuel J. Ko-
zak observed that by moving the
start of Rush back to the weekend
following orientation week, the
school would be leaving freshmen
with about 15 additional hours of free
time during orientation week. Kozak
said that the school would need to
provide meaningful activities for
freshmen during this time.

Kozak said that in the past, some
people said that freshmen had too
much spare time during orientation
week. Last year when Rush had be-
gun during orientation week some of
those extra hours had been absorbed,
he explained.

English Professor Jean C. Dunbar
and Associate Dean of the College
Pamela H. Simpson, who heads the
Coeducation Steering Committee,
said that the committee would try to
provide SAC with examples of poten-
tial orientation week activities in
time for SAC’s meeting Thursday.

Noting that students have express-
ed a desire to have more contact with
faculty members early in their fresh-
man year, Dunbar said that one idea
the committee was considering was
to reimburse faculty members for
part of the cost of having students
visit their homes for dinner during
orientation week.

She said that such dinners had been
too much of a financial burden for
many younger faculty members. The
partial reimbursement might encou-
rage more faculty members to have
freshmen visit their homes, Dunbar
said.

‘“‘We're not going to impose this on
anyone, or make it required,’’ Dun-
bar added.

Dunbar also suggested that a bar-
becue could be held, there could be a
reception for freshmen, and movies

could be shown. She said that the
goals of orientation week activities
should be developing class unity and
making the week seem like a regular
week of school.

Dean of Students Lewis G. John re-
ported that the Alumni Association
also had expressed interest in spon-
soring a barbecue during orientation
week.

Simpson said that a series of events
concerning the history of women at
W&L and in the South were also being
planned for the weekend of Sept.
13-15.

Some of the events included in the
program will be a display on the his-
tory of Washington and Lee and an
all-day symposium Sept. 14 on the
history of women in the South, which
will feature two nationally known
women scholars.

Both UC members and members of
the coed committee seemed to be
generally pleased with the IFC’s
overall Rush proposal.

John said that it was important to
note that the IFC had voted to allow
Washington and Lee women to attend
most Rush functions.

Simpson concurred that it would
have been bad to exclude women
from all Rush functions.

Simpson said Tuesday that al-
though not all the members of the
coed committee were completely sat-
isfied with the shape of Rush, the IFC
had done a good job in taking into ac-
count that W&L will be coed next
year.

“They were very sympathetic and
sensitive to the fact that there will be
women on campus next year,”’ Simp-
son said. “I think the IFC did a very
good job of listening.

Regarding the exhibits on women
at W&L to be presented next Sep-
tember, Simpson said there are
many women who made significant
contributions toW&L.

Annie Jo White, who created Fancy
Dress, and a local chapter of the
United Daughters of the Confeder-
acy, which successfully fought a pro-
posal in the 1920s to completely en-
case Lee Chapel in a larger building,
were just two of the examples Simp-
son listed of women who have made
significant contributions toW&L.

Simpson added that the exhibit on
women at W&L had been planned for
a long time and was not solely intend-
ed to complement the arrival of wo-
men next year.

EC to question cold check chairman;
Political Review appointment appealed

 

By MARSHALL BOSWELL

 

Staff Reporter

Personnel matters dominated
Monday night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

EC Secretary Sam Dalton voiced a
complaint concerning Student Finan-
cial Relations Committee Chairman
Henry Exall. Dalton charged Exall
with increased negligence in regard
to his duties as head of the SFRC, or
cold check committee, as it is com-
monly called.

B. Scott Tilley, editor of the Wash-
ington and Lee Political Review, pre-
sented a letter asking the EC to over-
turn the Publications Board’s choice
of Christopher Lion as next year’s
editor of the Political Review.

all stemmed from a phone call from
Lloyd's of Lexington to Carole Chap-
pell concerning bounced checks that
had not been picked up.

“Carole was being insulted by
Lloyd Smith,’’ Dalton said. ‘‘Henry
has been rude to her too, and I think
we should reconsider his appoint-
ment.”’

Dalton said that Chappell has been
receiving phone calls all year from
local businesses complaining that
bounced checks were not being pick-
ed up. Dalton said most of the bounc-
ed checks come from Lloyd's.

“There have just been too many
problems,”’ Dalton said. ‘‘Carole and
Henry haven’t worked well together
all year. Either he’s going to have to
change or we're going to have to ap-
point someone else.”’

Exall will defend himself at the
next EC meeting, April 22.

Last week, Exall appeared before
the EC in regard to a $73 bounced
check that the cold check committee
had written to the Palms to cover a
previous check bounced by a W&L

student.

In response to Dalton’s accusa-
tions, Exall said, ‘‘I don’t think that
replacement is warranted. There are
some communication problems be-
tween Carole and I, though, and I feel
that they can, and will, be worked out
before the meeting.”

Tilley’s letter to the EC claimed
that the Publications Board had ‘‘be-
trayed’’ his trust in choosing an edi-
tor ‘“‘whom it feels will do the best job
and uphold the standard of excel-
lence.”’

The Pub Board chose Lion over
Nelson Patterson by a 5-1 vote last
Thursday. Tilley’s was the only vote
in favor of Patterson.

Although Tilley claimed in the let-
ter that he felt Lion ‘‘is capable of do-
ing the job,” he still felt that the Pub
Board’s decision was ‘“‘highly irre-
sponsible.’’

‘*My feelings are more that the de-
cision be made on different consider-
ations, I think experience should be
considered over personality,’’ Tilley
said.

Tilley noted that Lion’s experience
with the Pub Board consisted of his
submitting one article, which is inthe
issue currently at press. Patterson,
on the other hand, served as assistant
editor this year.

David Sprunt, editor of the Calyx

and co-chairman of the Pub Board,
Said the decision was made on the
basis of an interview and an applica-
tion. Sprunt said that Patterson had

not given any indication that he want- °

ed the job in the interview and that
Lion presented himself much better.

Patterson’s initial application
consisted of his name, his address
and the job for which he was apply-
ing. Lion’s application, Sprunt said,
was much more extensive.

“It wasn’t an easy decision to
make, but we are happy with it,”
Sprunt said.

Mike Allen, a chief editor of The
Ring-tum Phi and also a member of
the Pub Board, said. ‘‘that the Pub
Board has made a mistake.”

The Pub Board had scheduled a
meeting this afternoon to attempt to
settle the matter outside the EC.

Bruce Potter, also co-chairman of
the Puh Roard said he hanes to pre
sent the possibility of a dual editor-
ship between Lion and Patterson.

“T think that will be a good way to
solve a tough, badly handled pro-
blem,”’ Allen said.

Sprunt said Tilley was not justified
in bringing his complaint to the EC.

‘I think the decisions made by the
Pub Board should be upheld,’’ Sprunt
said. ‘‘There was a vote taken and
it’s unfair to Chris Lion for us to go
back on our decision.”’

‘‘We really dropped the ball,’’ Al-
len said. ‘‘This is a painful, stupid sit-
uation to be in because Nelson and
Chris could both be great editors. I
hope the co-editor plan will pass and
both of them will be willing to accept
the job in spite of our screw-up.”’

Appointments made
to W&L publications

The University Publications Board
last week appointed juniors Mike
Allen, Paul Foutch and Cotton Pur-
year as the three top editors of next
year’s Ring-tum Phi, and junior Jeff
Kimbell was named business man-
ager.

Other positions filled by the Publi-
cations Board last week were Ariel
editor, junior Bob Strickland; Calyx
business manager, junior Watson
Barnes; and Political Review editor,
junior Chris Lion. The Political
Review decision has been appealed
to the Executive Committee.

No applications for Calyx editor
were received. The Board said it
hopes to fill that position during
spring term.

The Publications Board is compos-
ed of the editors and business man-
agers of the four publications.

The Phi appointees announced that
next year they plan to expand the
newspaper to two sections — a broad-
sheet section and a tabloid sports and
entertainment supplement.

‘I look forward as always to hear-
ing from readers about how we can
make their paper more interesting
and helpful,’’ said Allen, who will
hold the position of Executive Editor
and, will have overall responsibility
for the newspaper.

Foutch and Puryear will each have

Paper cites
press's effect
on politics

Despite the increasing omni-
presence of television as a source for
political news, newspapers continue
to play a more important role in the
United States’ political system, ac-
cording to associate professor of
journalism Hampden H. Smith III.

In a paper presented last weekend
at the Southeastern Regional Spring
Convention of the American Associa-
tion for Education in Journalism and
Mass Communications, Smith cited
data that indicate that ‘‘newspaper
readership is a major determinant of
political knowledge and activity...”

Further, he said the data show that
the strong relationship between
newspaper readership and political
knowledge has remained constant
over time, indicating the relationship
is not simply the result of other, tem-
porary forces.

In his paper, Smith used figures
from the 1972, 1976 and 1980 elections
to show positive, and usually sub-
stantial, correlations between news-
paper readership and three gauges of
political knowledge and activity he

developed. Those three gauges mea-

sure supportive attitudes concerning
voting, campaign activity level and a
sense of personal political efficacy.

For several decades, researchers
have found that the people who are
most active in politics tend to be well-
educated, be at least middle class
and have higher incomes. Smith’s
study indicates that mewspaper
readership should be added to educa-
tion, class and income as a major
determinant of political activity.

In addition, he compared people
with the same educational and in-
come levels and found that news-
paper readership continued to be
closely related to political activity.

 

12-12-6

Wa&L calendar is not alone

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

What does Washington and Lee
have in common with Cazenovia
College, Rhodes College and El-
mira College?

Those four schools, along with
about 13 others, have a short
spring semester built into their
academic calendars.

Washington and Lee has what is
commonly called a ‘‘12-12-6’’ aca-
demic calendar — two 12-week se-
mesters followed by a six-week se-
mester during the spring.

According to a publication by
the National Association of Col-
lege Stores, ‘‘List of School Open-
ing and Other Dates,” 17 schools
in addition to Washington and Lee
have a short term during the
spring.

Using the same publication, Or-
ville Walz, president of Concordia
College in Edmonton, Alberta, de-
veloped a study that showed that
about two-thirds of U.S. colleges,
or 1,800, operate under the ‘early
semester’ academic calendar.
Schools using this calendar begin
classes in August, and the first
semester ends before Christmas.
The second semester ends some-

time in May.

Walz also found that:

eThe number of schools with
“traditional semesters’? — in

which the first semester doesn’t

- end until after Christmas — has
declined from 895 in 1970-71 to 114
this year.

eIn 1970-71, 539 schools used the
quarter system — three 10- to 12-
week semesters. That number in-
creased to 751 this year.

eA total of 75 schools, the same
number as in 1970-71, use the tri-
mester system — a year-round
calendar of three semesters.

eThe 4-1-4 calendar — two nor-
mal semesters with a short, usual-
ly month-long semester in Jan-
uary or February — is used by 255
schools, compared with 186
schools in 1970-71.

Washington and Lee’s calendar
was lumped into a sixth category
called ‘‘other’’ with 107 schools, or
about 4 percent. These included
the schools with calendars similar
to W&L’s, a number of schools for
which information was not avail-
able and schools with other types
of calendars.

For example, one school in this
category, Cornell College in Mt.
Vernon, Iowa, has nine 312-week
terms, with a four-day weekend
between each term. Each student
takes one course a term. A spokes-
person for the school said that
Cornell College and Colorado Col-
lege in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
are the only schools with such
calendars.

Many of the 17 schools that have
spring semesiers have a four-
week semester in the spring,
rather than W&L’s six weeks.

At least one school that has a

 

six-week spring semester is think-
ing about changing its calendar.
Rhodes College in Memphis,
Tenn. (formerly Southwestern of
Memphis), has a six-week semes-
ter from April 15 to May 24, ac-
cording to Helen Norman, assis-
tant to the president for public in-
formation.

“It’s supposed to be for more
creative sorts of endeavors,”’ said
Norman, who added that travel
abroad programs and internships
are offered during the short se-
mester.

Despite the advantages, “there
are and have been problems with
it,” Norman said. Among these,
she added, are that classes that
are supposed to be small actually
have large numbers of students.
In addition, ‘‘it’s a difficult term |,
system to organize in terms of fac-
ulty and scheduling and that sort
of thing,”’ she said.

“It’s just kind of an administra-
tive nightmare, I think.”

Although the students are op- |*
posed to any change in the calen-
dar and_ successfully lobbied
against a change a few years ago,
the faculty does seem to favora |,
change, Norman said.

A committee studying ways to
enhance the academic program |, y
recommended changing the cal-
endar because it ‘“‘thinks the quali-
ty of the educational program |+« ,
could be improved by getting
away from that,’’ Norman added.

An ad hoc faculty committee at
W&L studied the possibility last |- 4
year of changing the calendar, but
the faculty voted in the fall to re-
tain the 12-12-6 calendar. Still be- |j* *
ing studied is a calendar that
would divide the year into five six-
week semesters. mi

Walz found in his study. ‘‘Basical- |, | .

an interview this week. One rea- |- +

heating classrooms for that

Other colleges may be turning |< | +
away from the short semester at
the end of the school year, Walz
said, because ‘‘once the two se- |« | +
mesters are done, colleges are
finding that students want to get
out and get jobs.”’ ls

“In calendars, what are the ad-
vantages of one are the disadvan-
tages of another,” Walz contin- |. | .
ued. ‘‘The curriculum should de-

Two Virginia colleges, Ran-

and Mary Baldwin College in

university race relations —-

 

From Staff Reports

 

A group of Washington and Lee
students and faculty members par-
ticipated in a conference Saturday on
black-white relations at predomi-
nantly white school.

The 13 students — three of whom
are white — and four faculty mem-
bers attended movies and discuss-
ions about problems minorities have
on campus, interracial teaching
effectiveness, and strategies for
increasing interracial participation
in University activities,

Students and faculty members
from other area schools attended the
annual conference at the University
of Virginia.

Billy Rhinehart, treasurer for the
Student Association for Black Unity,
said he got a lot out of the conference.

“I got a lot of frustrations out,”
Rhinehart said. ‘‘It helped me just to
deal with [the problems]. I know
there are a lot of problems... You just
have to try to get what you can out of
the whole W&L experience and just
try tohelp make the minority agenda
a student body issue.”

SCC: ‘more respect’

From Staff Reports

 

Junior Townes Pressler, who last
month was elected president of the
Class of 1986 for the fourth straight
time, says that when he was deciding
whether to run for student body pres-
ident or senior class president, it
really came down to a choice be-
tween ‘‘my resume and where I knew
I should be.”’

There aren’t many people who
would choose the second option.

Pressler did.

He said the agonizing decision of
whether to run for student body pres-
ident, which heads the Executive
Committee, or senior class president,
which chairs the Student Control
Committee, was really a matter of
choosing ‘‘between myself and the
school.”’

“It was really kind of distressing to
me — I didn’t know what to do,”’ he
recalls.

Pressler said one consideration
was the recognition and trappings

A year

that accompany the student body
presidency that just don’t go with
senior class president.

“That's one thing that weighed on
my mind — the prestige,’’ he said. “‘I
knew it would help me later on. But
school is the best years of your life.
You can’t let something like that in-
fluence what you do.”’

Pressler said that although the
more prestigious office looked tempt-
ing at first, “‘I was not interested in
[EC] and I never have been.”’

The other people running this year
“were perfectly capable of being EC
president, and by running, I would
just have been splitting up the vote
even more,’’ Pressler explained.
“We're alla lot alike and have a lot of
the same ideas.”’

He said his final decision was bas-
ed on the fact that ‘‘Student Control
will have a lot more responsibility
next year’’ because of a number of
recommendations by the Drug Policy
Review Committee. (See story, page
‘

Darby Brower, the current senior

late

class president and a member of the
drug policy committee, said that
group’s proposal makes it critical to
have someone of Pressler’s ability
and reputation at the Student Control
helm.

“Townes and I talked about it a
lot,’’ Brower said of the choice be-
tween the two offices. ‘I think a lot of
that decision came from the fact that
the committee will have more re-
sponsibility next year.’

‘Townes has always been a source
of good judgment with respect to past
cases,”’ he continued. ‘‘Among other
people, he is well-spoken, and people
very much respect his word.’’

“He has a good deal of control and
is rational in his thinking,’’ he added.

“The only way the changes are go-
ing to stick is if the committee con-
tinues to bring out responsible con-
clusions to the cases they hear,”
Brower said.

Pressler, who has served on Stu-
dent Control for three years and act-
ed as its chairman for three months
last year, said his goal is to continue

   

 

TOWNES PRESSLER

the trend toward more respect for the
committee that has begun under
Brower’s leadership.

“‘We’ve handed out some pretty
stiff penalties, and now I think people
will think twice about doing some of
these things,” Pressler said.

“It’s going to be a whole new crew
next year,’’ he added, noting that he
is the only returning member of next
year’s Student Control. ‘‘With my ex-
perience, people will see that Student
Control is not just made up of popular
class officers — it’s made up of ser-
ious people.”’

Senior turns tables as write-in vote leads to UC post

 

By PAULFOUTCH
News Editor

 

Talk about irony — this beats all.

Last year David Sprunt was a can-
didate for senior representative to
the University Council. He was one of
only two candidates running for three
spots, but he still managed to lose the
election.

This year he wasn’t even on the
ballot, and he ended up winning.

The explanation of this curious
turn of events involves a student gov-
ernment election system that Sprunt
says needs revision.

“It’s really kind of a screwy sys-
tem that they have,” he said.

The story begins in the spring of
last year:

eAs a junior, Sprunt decides he will
be able to fit work on the UC, a stu-
dent-faculty-administration advisory
committee, into an extracurricular
schedule that will include the editor-
ship of the Calyx. He turns in a peti-
tion with 50 signatures to the Voting
Regulations Board and is placed on
the ballot with Harry Golliday.

eIn the election Golliday gets 52
votes and Sprunt gets 34, beating out
two write-in candidates, Bill Joel and
Andy Haring. Interpreting the Stu-
dent Body constitution, the Execu-
tive Committee decides that since no
candidate received a majority, a run-
off will be held among the top four

vote-getters — meaning the election
will be held again, but with the write-
in candidates on the ballot.

“The whole section on ballots in the
Student Body constitution is very am-
biguous,”’ Sprunt said.

“It doesn’t address the problem of
a three-position race. The EC didn’t
know how tointerpret it.”’

The constitution says that if no can-
didate receives a majority in a two-
position race, a runoff will be held
among the top four vote-getters.
There is no mention of a three-posi-
tion race.

“It doesn’t say anything about the
senior University Council elections,”
Sprunt said.

eIn the runoff, Golliday and Haring
win. Sprunt beats Joel, 34-33, but then
finds out that a senior friend of his
voted for him. He informs the EC
that the election must be a tie, since
seniors aren’t allowed to vote.

“What price honor?’’ Sprunt ask-
ed.

eIn the final election to resolve the
tie, Joel beats Sprunt.

So from running practically unop-
posed, he ended up losing.

This year a similar situation arose,
with Sprunt on the other side. Again
there were only two candidates —
McGowan Patrick and Andrew Wein-
berg — in the March 25 election for
the three senior UC spots.

Sprunt explained that Andrew Ca-
ruthers, next year’s EC vice presi-

 

DAVID SPRUNT

dent, was manning the poll near the
Commerce School when Sprunt walk-
edby.

‘He said, ‘Why don’t you vote for
yourself. Write yourself in.’ I voted
for myself and that was it.”’

He put a note on his ballot saying
he was a returning senior and would
like to be considered for a position.

That one vote enabled..Sprunt to
make the runoff, along with two other
write-in candidates — Lou Mondello
and Tom Spilsbury.

Sprunt won a UC position in the
runoff, coming in third place with 80
votes, six ahead of Spilsbury.

“T didn’t ask anybody to vote for
me at all,” Sprunt said. “I didn’t

think I could win.”

“‘T got more votes this year than I
got last year.”

He puts most of the blame for that
situation on apathetic voters.

“I don’t know if it would be right to
say it’s a popularity contest, but it’s
name recognition more than any-
thing,” he said.

As for how to correct the situation
that led to his defeat last year: ‘‘I
think the person who got his petition
in should win if he gets the most votes
the first time,” he said.

That would mean amending the
constitution.

“‘The student body constitution has
some unnecessary stuff. There’s a
whole section in there about a student
body teasurer, and there hasn’t been
a student body treasurer since 1972,”
he said.

VRB chairman David Hanna
agreed with Sprunt that candidates
who turn in their petitions should not
be penalized by having to run against
write-in candidates on a second bal-
lot.

“On the other hand, the voter
should have the option of voting for
whomever he wants,”’ Hanna said.
“They shouldn’t be limited.”’

Sprunt said he hopes his write-in
victory didn’t defeat a candidate who
turned his petition in on time.

He didn’t. The two original candi-
dates won. So did Sprunt — a year
late.

Chinese scholar calls for educational diversity

 

By PAULSMITH
Staff Reporter

 

The present reforms in Chinese
education are ‘responses to the
changes in China’s economic policy,”’
the president of one of China’s lar-
gest universities said Friday.

Dr. Xie Xide, professor of physics
and president of Fudan University in
Shanghai and a member of the Cen-.
tral Committee of the Chinese Com-
munist party, spoke at W&L under
the sponsorship of W&L’s East Asian
Studies Program.

Changes in the Chinese economy,
according to Dr. Xie, include the re-
instatement of a market economy in
the rural districts, relaxation of the
state’s control of businesses and en-
terprises and changes in the wage al-
location system.

“We are trying to encourage the
diligent and hard working people,”’

she said, noting that many of the
reforms are aimed at eliminating
complacency among the workers and
reinstating competition.

“There is a tendency after the
period of turmoil, that people don’t
work anymore,”’ she contended. ‘‘We
are moving away from the idea of
‘eating from the samerice pot.’ ”’

‘“‘We must relax the state control of
enterprises,’’ she urged, comparing
political managers to ‘‘mothers-in-
law,”’ an analogy that brought laugh-
ter from the audience.

Education’s response, according to
Dr. Xie, is to provide a better balance
in academic subjects, a variety of ed-
ucational subjects to a greater part
of tbe population and more freedom
from governmental interference of
both educators and students.

Dr. Xie stressed the theme of di-
versity in education. ‘‘We do not have
enough students in social sciences,”
she said. ‘‘These are the fields that
we muststress in the future.”’

IFC poll says upperclassmen
narrowly support early Rush

 

From Staff Reports

 

Interfraternity Council members
last week were given the results of a
poll that shows fraternity members
are ‘barely in favor of keeping Rush
as it is now’’ when offered the choice
of the current calendar or a deferred
Rush.

That’s the analysis of Lee Hollis,
chairman of the Fraternity Affairs
Subcommittee of the Coeducation
Steering Committee. The unscientific
survey of 280 fraternity members
and 75 independents was conducted
during spring term registration by
the coed committee and the IFC.

Hollis told the IFC members that
the poll was “really not that big of a
sample,” so the results should be
interpreted cautiously.

Incoming IFC President Jaimie
Hayne joined Hollis in his skep-
ticism.

“That poll, to me, is not really va-
lid because of the amount of people
responding,”’ Hayne said. ‘‘I think
everyone was in a hurry when they
filled it out and didn’t really think
about the consequences of their
answers.” :

“I think a lot of people are for a
deferred Rush in theory but in practi-
eality here at W&L it wouldn’t

work,”’ he added.

Hollis said administrators had
noted that the poll showed 12 percent
of the 120 freshmen responding said
they would have made a different de-
cision if they had more time, and 31
percent said they might have. Of the
30 independent freshmen responding,
30 percent said they would have
decided differently and 33 percent
said they might have.

IFC officers

Next year’s Interfraternity
Council officers elected by frater-
nity members are President
Jaimie Hayne (Kappa Alpha) and
Vice President Greg Wheeler (Pi
Kappa Alpha).

Elected at last week’s IFC
meeting were Treasurer Mac
McGrew (Phi Delta Theta),
Secretary Scott Adams (Phi Kap-
pa Sigma), Senior Justice Bill
Zola (Delta Tau Delta), Junior
Justices Chris Lynch (Beta Theta
Pi) and Will Esham (Sigma Chi),
Rush Chairman Sam Svalina (Chi

Hugh Black (Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon) and Rush Book Editor
Glynn Alexander (SAE).

 

 

 

She cited many statistics that
showed engineering and the physical
sciences as the major fields taught in
the Chinese curriculum since the
Communist revolution of 1949. More-
over, since the ‘cultural revolution,’
physical sciences have continued to
be emphasized, although alongside a
renewed interest in the natural
sciences.

She also expressed a great desire
to see law and politics return as a
major field of study. ‘‘We do not have
enough scholars in politics and law,”
she noted. ‘‘I have deep respect for
lawyers in this country.”’

She attributed much of China’s po-
litical turmoil to the lack of scholars
in law and politics. She also would
like to see more scholars in the fields
of economics, agriculture and jour-
nalism,

In terms of journalism, ‘‘We would
like more cooperation with you in de-
veloping these courses,’ she said,
referring to the possibility of an ex-

change between Fudan and W&L.

‘‘We would like to revise our curri-
culum...so that it is a more basic cur-
riculum,”’ she added. ‘‘For example,
less compulsory courses, more elec-
tive courses and more flexibility.”

In response to a question dealing
with her views on the present objec-
tives of the Chinese Communist Par-

Skipping Goshen
for the Galapagos

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

While the majority of Washington
and Lee students are slaving away in
the coming six weeks, deeply involv-
ed in spring term courses and taking
time out for an occasional trip to
Goshen Pass, a group of eight W&L
biology students and two professors
will be on a different kind of trip, a
field trip to the Galapagos Islands.

For four weeks in April and May,
biology Professor Cleveland P. Hick-
man Jr. and assistant Professor
Peter W. Bergstrom will lead the stu-
dent expedition to the Galapagos, a
Pacific island group about 600 miles
west of Ecuador.

The trip, the biology department’s
sixth to the Galapagos, is organized
as Biology 216, Supervised Field
Study, a six-credit course during
which the students study the plant
and animal life of the islands and the
biology of a tropical forest on the
Ecuadorian mainland. After their
field work, the group will return to
W&L, where the students must write
two essays in order to complete the
course.

Hickman, leader of the previous
five trips, outlined the itinerary of
this spring’s excursion. After a week
of orientation on South America — in-
cluding lectures about its economy,
culture and other topics — the group
will leave for Miami on April 29.

From Miami, the group will fly to
Guayaquil, Ecuador, and then on to
the Galapagos Islands. There they
will board a 60-foot ship that will
serve as their home base while they
tour the islands. From the ship, the
group will make daily excursions on-
to land to do their research, including
a hike to the top of Volcan Alcedo, a
volcano, Hickman said that as many
as 4,000 giant Galapagos tortoises
live inside the caldera of the volcano.

While these tortoises may be the
best-known of the Galapagos’ animal
inhabitants, they certainly are not
the most exotic. Hickman said there
are many species of plants, animals
and birds on the islands that are
found nowhere else. He added that
there are also many types of life that
are absent from the Galapagos.

The Galapagos are a unique biolog-
ical showcase, Hickman said, and
they are only two million years old,
relatively young in geological terms.

In addition to the islands’ relative
youth, their inaccessible location led
to “erratic colonization,’’ Hickman
said. Animals had difficulty getting
to the islands, which are volcanic in
origin, and many types of animals
never have been observed in the Gal
apagos. There are no amphibians or
freshwater fish, Hickman said, and
few mammals. Also, many plant
groups are not represented on the
islands.

Reconstructing the evolution of the
islands is fairly easy, Hickman said
There has not been much time for the
animals to change or to develop fear,
and because the Galapagos devel-
oped without predators, the animals
are tame. This allows the students to
study the animals freely, Hickman
said, and also provides good photo-
graphic opportunities.

The Galapagos recently have had
some problems, Hickman said, not
ing that about 50,000 acres of Isabela
Island have been destroyed by fires
in the past few weeks.

“‘We’re worried about Isabela,’
said Hickman, adding that there is
some concern about the group being
permitted on the island while the
fires are burning. Isabela is the loca-
tion of the volcano the group plans to
climb.

This time of year is usually the
rainy season, Hickman said, recall-
ing that the last trip W&L students
made to the islands was almost rain-
ed out by bad storms. When there are
extreme weather conditions, Hick-
man said, the biology of the islands
can become endangered. The rains
two years ago diluted the sea water
and threatened the sea life, he said,
and the drought the area currently is
experiencing is detrimental to the
life on this island.

Only 10 percent of the Galapagos
Islands are inhabited, Hickman said.
The remainder of the land is protect-
ed by the Ecuadorian national park
system. There is ‘‘nothing you'd call
a city,’’ he said. Instead, the island
has two small towns, and the
tion of the islands is about 6,000

While most of the time will be
taken up with researching and study-
ing the life on the Galapagos, Hick-
man said there is time for the stu-
dents to enjoy some of the more tra-
ditional aspects of spring term, such
as swimming and snorkling. One stu-
dent even plans to scuba dive, he add-
ed.

Campaign against apartheid
to include movies, speaker

 

From Staff Reports

 

A group of Washington and Lee
students and faculty began its cam-
paign last night to ask the Board of
Trustees to consider action to protest
apartheid in South Africa.

Members of the audience at two
movies shown by the Washington and
Lee Campaign Against Apartheid
were asked to sign a resolution call-
ing on the trustees to consider appro-
priate action the University could
take.

Such action could include having
the University’s financial portfolios
examined to determine if the Univer-
sity invests in any companies doing
business in South Africa, according
to one of the organizers, law Profes-
sor William S. Geimer. If so, the Uni-
versity could stop its investments in
that company, he added.

“If you’re in South Africa doing
business, you’re supporting apart-
heid,”’ Geimer said. ‘‘The issue is not
whether a black in South Africa is
making the same amount of money
per hour as a black in Zimbabwe. The
issue is, ‘When are they going to have
control over their own lives?’ ’’

The group originally had planned

it possible for more work to be done
with the same number of people.”
How soon such automation will be us-
ed at W&L, though, ‘‘is hard to tell,”
she added.

Brown said she was interested in
coming back to Washington and Lee
because she likes the school. “I like
its size; I like where it’s located; I
like the interdepartmental relation-
ships that there are among the facul-
ty,’’ she added.

The decision by the University to
become coeducational at the under-
graduate level also pleased her. ‘‘I

was delighted,’ she added. “I think
that it was a great decision to make.”’
Brown said the question of whether
the library should remain open 24
hours a day was discussed during her
February visit to campus, but she
refrained from expressing an opinion
on the issue. ‘“‘I’d have to know more
information,” she said. ‘‘I’d like to
know what resources they’re using
{at night] and whether they’re using
library materials or just studying.”’

Brown was born in Charles City,
Iowa, and graduated from Iowa State

University in 1963. In 1964, she
received her master’s degree from
Columbia University.

She worked as a librarian at Cor-
nell University for seven years
before coming to W&L in 1971.

In 1976, Brown left W&L to become
assistant university librarian for

  
  

General Reader Services at Prince-
ton University. In 1980, she took her
current position with Research
Libraries Group, a consortium of 30
large research libraries working
together to solve problems faced by
larger libraries.

Brown has written several papers
for library publications and is a
member of the American Library As-
sociation and the Association of Col-
lege and Research Libraries.

to ask the school to halt purchases of
IBM products, but later learned that
IBM has ceased sales to the South
African police and military.

Last night’s movies, Geimer saiq,
were designed to ‘‘give a flavor of
apartheid in action. They show
everyday life in South Africa."’

The group plans to show four more
movies during April — ‘Six Days in
Soweto’’ and “Discarded People’’
next Thursday at 7:30 in the Law
School and ‘Generations of Resis-
tance’’ and ‘‘South Africa Belongs to
Us” April 25 at 7:30 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

In addition, Law School Dean Fred-
eric L. Kirgis Jr. will speak on
“South Africa: Human Rights, Inter-
national Law,” April 23 at 7.30 p.m.
in the Law School.

Other plans include showin’ video
tapes of ABC News’ Nightline, ....icu

ca, according to Susan Stull, docu
ments technician in the Law
library.

In addition to attempting to plave
the issue on the Board of Trustee
agenda, another goal of the cam
paign is to bring the matter to the
attention of students, Geimer said.

Just look at the benefits (Yes, these prices are INNN-SANE!):
Games will not only feature competition between different teams but
conceivably also between different players on the same team. Can you
see a team trying to run a four corners when two guys have money
wagered on their opponents? Also, just think of the increases in TV

after they graduate magna cum prima donna from Bookie U. Hey, if
they fix games in the ‘‘amateur’’ (cough) game, is it much of a jump to
say they might do it in the big leagues, too? (A season of 82 games is
going to need some type of excitement every now and then.) It’s kind
of an internship program. And they’ve got a shot clock. Can 20-second

Point shaving adds a whole new dimension to the college game. Box

Slump, controversy surround baseball

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team dropped its record to 3-11 yes-
terday after losing 14-9 to Hampden-
Sydney in Lexington.

W&L head coach Jim Murdock
started freshmen Michael Suttle,
Alex Sutton and Carnpent Clement in
place of regulars Billy White, Milam
Turner and Chuck Nelson against the
Tigers. Freshman Kevin Topping
started at catcher for Mike Jacoby.
Murdock’s ploy failed as H-S jumped
out to an 11-2 lead before holding off a
late General rally.

The problems in the game went be-
yond the score. Generals starting pit-
cher Kirk Breen and Murdock ex-
changed words after the second in-
ning, eventually leading to Breen’s
being benched. The junior left the
field during the fifthinning.

“T thought Kirk was cooling off
{after being removed from the
game], and then I looked up and saw
him driving off,’’ Murdock said. He
said that Breen’s status with the
team is uncertain.

Breen could not be reached for
comment last night.

The game got off to a pleasant
start, however. W&L took an early
1-0 lead, only to see H-SC score three

runs in the top of the second off
Breen.

“T started the freshmen to add
some variety, some change,’ Mur-
dock said. ‘‘We’ve been losing any-
how, and I decided to give them a
chance. We've got to be thinking
about next year, even though we
haven't given upon this year yet.”

Freshman Eric Acra_ relieved
Breen in the third inning, and W&L
cut the score to 3-2 after Sutton and
Don Thayer led off with walks and
advanced a base after Clement
reached on an error. Suttle grounded
out, scoring Sutton to make the score
3-2.

The Tigers exploded for six runs in
the fifth, chasing Acra and forcing
Murdock to send freshman Carter
Steuart to the mound. H-SC stretched
its lead to 11-2 in the sixth when a
Tiger runner scored from second ona
passed ball and another scored from
third on another passed ball.

W&L first baseman Bill Schoettel-
kotte singled with one out in the sixth
and scored on Ricky Zahn’s triple.
Turner singled to score Zahn to bring
the score to 11-4.

H-SC struck back in the seventh,
scoring twice, only to see the Gen-
erals answer with four runs of their
own in the bottom of the inning. Nel-
son led off with a walk and scored on
White's triple. Tom Mack followed

Dr. James W. Worth, coach of the
W&L Fencing Club, placed third in
men’s foil in the U.S. Fencing Assoc-
iation 1985 State Championship Na-
tional Qualifiers last weekend.

The field of 22 fencers at Randolph-
Macon Woman's College competing
in various age levels included the
William and Mary fencing coach and
some of the top club fencers in the
state. The finish qualifies Worth for
competition both at the sectional
meet in May in Pittsburgh and at the

national meetin Cleveland.

It was the third official foil and on-
ly the second ‘‘electrical foil’’ com-
petition for Worth, who until last year
primarily used the saber. (It is called
electric because of the scoring device
used to judge the bout.) Although the
saber and foil fighters score points or
“touches”’ for different targets — for
foil the torso and for saber strikes
above the waist — according to
Worth, ‘‘The footwork, timing, speed
and strategy are complementary.”

‘You don’t need brute strength to
fence,’ he added, ‘‘but conditioning
can make the difference.’’ Worth has

The Washington and Lee track
team captured four second places at
Mary Washington College’s Battle-
field Relays last weekend.

At Friday’s field events, Mike
McAlevey and John Carder were run-
ners-up in their events. McAlevey
threw the javelin 178’ 6’, while
Carder pole vaulted 12’.

Saturday’s track events saw fresh-
man Andy White take second place in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of
15.3. The W&L sprint relay team of

‘Chris Ives, John White, Chris Bleggi
and Mark Pembroke finished second

head and controlling the game. All
was quiet until junior attackman
Todd Breithaupt decided to stir
things up. Breithaupt made things
closer with his first goal of the
season.

The first period was important in
the Generals’ development this sea-
son, They proved they could come
back. W&L did come back against
Maryland on March 16, but this was
the first time in '85 that the Generals
were able to come back to prevent an
early blowout.

Daly said the Generals were’ “‘out-
played” in the second period, but
they weren’t outscored. With 6:48 left
in the half the Tigers’ Mullins scored
for the second time in the game, this
time ona clear, making the score 5-3,

The Generals needed goals, and
they soon got what they needed. With
1:06 left in the half, Deringer took ad-
vantage of a man-up situation to
score his second of the day and cut
the margin to one goal. Then Rod
Santomassimo opened the field up on
a breakaway and found Deringer for
the hat trick to tie the game up at the
half as the teams went to the locker
rooms at the intermission.

(Pembroke) runs 800 meters.

Although team scores are not kept
at invitational meets, head track
coach Norris Aldridge maintains that
there is still team identity. ‘But you
concentrate on your own event,’’ he
added. Coach Aldridge continued:
‘‘We compete as a team but are pri-
marily concerned with bringing our
individual times down.”

He added that his teams usually
face very tough competition at invi-
tational meets. Aldridge concluded
that the work on individual times and
competition against tougher oppo-
nents prepares the Generals to de-
fend their crown at the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference outdoor
championships.

On April 20, the Generals will tra-
vel to Greenville, S.C., to compete in
the Furman Invitational. On April 27,
the Generals will host the ODAC out-
door championships at Wilson Field

When the teams headed back to the
field for the second half, nothing had
changed: There was still mist, mud
and cold. But with 12.47 left in the
third period, the score did change.

Junior attackman Bill Holmes
teamed up with Deringer to get his
first score of the game and give W&L
the lead. Towson, after a 3-0. dry
spell, figured a reply was in order.
Three minutes later, Winkoff came
from behind the goal to get his second
score and tie the gameatsix.

Things began looking much like the
first period again when Conley took
advantage of a man-up and scored
unassisted with 9:14 left in the
quarter. But that lead didn’t last, as
Deringer got his fourth on a return-
the-favor assist from Holmes.

The seesaw battle continued when
the Tigers capitalized on another
man-up situation. Mike Policastre
gave Towson the lead at 8-7,

The fourth period saw the tension
mount when Conley added his second
goal of the game to give the Tigers a
two-goal lead with 11:44 lefttoplay.

Sandy Brown then cut the lead to
one with an unassisted goal. With
1:03 left, W&L got the break it was

looking for — another man-up situa-
tion. But the Generals did not score
with the man advantage, and the
game ended at9-8.

Assistant coach Sam Carpenter de-
scribed his feelings with a movie
reference. ‘‘You know how [Chief]
Inspector {Dreyfuss} gets that ner-
vous twitch around Clousseau in Pink
Panther movies? That’s how I get
when people mention Towson State.”’

The Generals did have some fine
individual performances, however.
Goalie John DiDuro had 16 saves de-
spite the funny bounces in the mud.
Rich Schoenberg continued his domi-
nation of the face-off, winning 17 of 21
attempts. W&L also recovered 61 of
56 percent of the ground balls.

Daly is proud of his team despite
the current slump.

‘‘T think the team has represented
W&L well. They've played and train-
ed hard and continue to work as hard
as 33 players can,” he said. ‘I wish
we could have picked up a win here
or there, though, as positive rein-
forcement.”

its only victory coming in a doubie-
header against Emory & Henry.

Last Thursday, W&L lost a 10-1 de-
cision to Virginia Military Institute.
Schoettelkotte pitched three score-
less innings before allowing the Key-

W&L split an ODAC doubleheader
with Emory & Henry Saturday, los-
ing the first game 8-7 and winning the
second 8-4.

The Generals carried a 4-2 lead into

score 8-4. W&L’s comeback effort in

“T think fencing has tremendous
advantages over more _ popular

he said. ‘Twenty years after college,

cut to three in the bottom of the in-
ning.

E&H made it 6-4 in the sixth, but
the Generals put the game on ice in
the top of the seventh by adding two
moreruns.

Tuesday, Eastern Mennonite once
again proved to be too tough for the
Generals as W&L fell 8-i at home.

Just as in EMC’s 16-0 win over
W&L earlier this season, Doug Byler
baffled the Generals hitters as he pit-
ched a six-hit complete game. EMC
scored twice in both the second and
third against starting pitcher Schoet-
telkotte. Any hope of a Generals
comeback was killed in the top of the
ninth when EMC scored four times to
make the score 8-1.

Despite his team’s 1-7 ODAC re-
cord, Murdock remains steadfast in
his optimistic outlook for the season.

“T still believe that we have a
shot,’’ Murdock said. ‘We still have
an outside chance of finishing in the
top four inthe conference.”

‘“‘These are the times that will help
later on,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘These
guys are learning how to deal with
adversity. I just hope we keep our
heads up and keep working hard.
This has been a frustrating part of
the year.”

The Generals’ next game is April
16 at Lynchburg.

As a child, Worth recalls waving
sticks in imaginary sword fights and
seeing sword fights in movies. When
he was 15, he joined a Dayton YMCA
fencing class and began his formal
instruction.

Worth hopes to have increased par-
ticipation in fencing at W&L, espec-
ially with the transition to coeduca-
tion next fall. ‘‘This year we had five
or six [fencers] return to the club,
but we need about nine for a colle-
giate team with a backup.... There is
a women’s club in Virginia, and
women here would be able to com-
pete,”’ he said.

The Washington and Lee golf team,
sporting a changed lineup to test
some of its depth, was defeated by

W&L carded a team total of 324 for

N

o Norelco

Is this college hoops’
most exciting idea?

...Gee, isn’t it neat with all the
changes coming to light in college
basketball that we finally got one
that will really let the game turn the
corner toward more excitement.
Granted, the 45-second clock has
done some good things for the game.
Expanding the tournament to in-

{ clude 64 teams was a choice move,
too. (We'd really rather have the tournament open to everyone, Divi-
sion III champions, fraternity IM champs, YMCA champs and cham-
pions from the Big Sky Conference, in that order. )

No, these ideas were fine, but not good enough. You need something
that’s going to attract everybody, all the time. Well, there are only two
things that can fit that bill, and since Christie Brinkley just got mar-
ried, that attraction has got to be money, as in gambling. And college
hoops has finally conceived of an idea that puts the Big East con-
ference in the old hat category. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve got two
magic words for you: point shaving, and I’m not talking Norelco.

Just look at the benefits (Yes, these prices are INNN-SANE!):
Games will not only feature competition between different teams but
conceivably also between different players on the same team. Can you
see a team trying to run a four corners when two guys have money
wagered on their opponents? Also, just think of the increases in TV
revenues as more and more housewives become college basketball
fans. (‘‘This is more fun than the state lottery,’’ says Miss Sophie
Glutz from Ft. Lee, N.J.)

And let’s not forget how big a bonus it’l] be for our student-athletes.
They’ll get to experience life in much the same manner as it will be
after they graduate magna cum prima donna from Bookie U. Hey, if
they fix games in the ‘‘amateur’’ (cough) game, is it much of a jump to
say they might do it in the big leagues, too? (A season of 82 games is
going to need some type of excitement every now and then.) It’s kind
of an internship program. And they’ve got a shot clock. Can 20-second
timeouts, no zone defenses and Dancing Harry be far behind?

Point shaving adds a whole new dimension to the college game. Box
scores won’t give individual point totals any more, but how many
points under his average Joe Cash ‘N Carry is and whether the Green
Wave (isn’t that funny?) beat the spread. Scoreboards, once reserved
for the score and foul situations, now will include flashing pari-mutuel
odds. And when you walk into your favorite fieldhouse and ask the lady
at the $2 window if there are any seats in Section H, you might be rude-
ly enlightened. (‘‘No sir, bets are closed on whether Looie’s going to
wear that ugly sweater again.’’)

Yes, point shaving is an idea indeed whose benefits are limitless.
College basketball will be so changed we won’t ever again recognize it

as that silly game where giving your all never had an ulterior motive
and making a mistake was never something you tried todo....

A W&L batsman takes a crack in the third inning during yesterday's game with Hampden-Sydney. The Generals lost 13-9.

Slump, controversy surround baseball

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee baseball
team dropped its record to 3-11 yes-
terday after losing 14-9 to Hampden-
Sydney in Lexington.

W&L head coach Jim Murdock
started freshmen Michael Suttle,
Alex Sutton and Carnpent Clement in
place of regulars Billy White, Milam
Turner and Chuck Nelson against the
Tigers. Freshman Kevin Topping
started at catcher for Mike Jacoby.
Murdock’s ploy failed as H-S jumped
out to an 11-2 lead before holding off a
late General rally.

The problems in the game went be-
yond the score. Generals starting pit-
cher Kirk Breen and Murdock ex-
changed words after the second in-
ning, eventually leading to Breen’s
being benched. The junior left the
field during the fifthinning.

“IT thought Kirk was cooling off
{after being removed from the
game], and then I looked up and saw
him driving off,’’ Murdock said. He
said that Breen’s status with the
team is uncertain.

Breen could not be reached for
comment last night.

The game got off to a pleasant
start, however. W&L took an early
1-0 lead, only to see H-SC score three

runs in the top of the second off
Breen.

“T started the freshmen to add
some variety, some change,’’ Mur-
dock said. ‘“‘We’ve been losing any-
how, and I decided to give them a
chance. We've got to be thinking
about next year, even though we
haven't given up on this year yet.”

Freshman Eric Acra_ relieved
Breen in the third inning, and W&L
cut the score to 3-2 after Sutton and
Don Thayer led off with walks and
advanced a base after Clement
reached on an error. Suttle grounded
out, scoring Sutton to make the score
3-2.

The Tigers exploded for six runs in
the fifth, chasing Acra and forcing
Murdock to send freshman Carter
Steuart to the mound. H-SC stretched
its lead to 11-2 in the sixth when a
Tiger runner scored from second ona
passed ball and another scored from
third on another passed ball.

W&L first baseman Bill Schoettel-
kotte singled with one out in the sixth
and scored on Ricky Zahn’s triple.
Turner singled to score Zahn to bring
the score to 11-4.

H-SC struck back in the seventh,
scoring twice, only to see the Gen-
erals answer with four runs of their
own in the bottom of the inning. Nel-
son led off with a walk and scored on
White's triple. Tom Mack followed

Dr. James W. Worth, coach of the
W&L Fencing Club, placed third in
men’s foil in the U.S. Fencing Assoc-
iation 1985 State Championship Na-
tional Qualifiers last weekend.

The field of 22 fencers at Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College competing
in various age levels included the
William and Mary fencing coach and
some of the top club fencers in the
state. The finish qualifies Worth for
competition both at the sectional
meet in May in Pittsburgh and at the

national meet in Cleveland.

It was the third official foil and on-
ly the second ‘‘electrical foil’ com-
petition for Worth, who until last year
primarily used the saber. (It is called
electric because of the scoring device
used to judge the bout.) Although the
saber and foil fighters score points or
“touches”’ for different targets — for
foil the torso and for saber strikes
above the waist — according to
Worth, ‘‘The footwork, timing, speed
and strategy are complementary.”

“You don’t need brute strength to
fence,’’ he added, ‘but conditioning
can make the difference.’’ Worth has

Towson’s Jeff Peek moved the mar-

later, John Luppe was feeling a little
left out of the fun so he took a pass
from Conley and fired home Towson’
fourth unanswered tally.

Daly immediately called time out
before any additional damage was
done.

“Time out was to calm people
down,’’ said senior co-captain Dave
Johnston. ‘‘After that, we started to
play without mistakes and were able
to pick the tempo up. Nobody thought
we were going to lose. We still
thought we would win.”’

The time out proved effective. The
Generals’ offense began moving the
ball. With a man-up situation, the
Generals capitalized. Junior attack-
man G.T. Corrigan cut the lead down
to 4-2 with his second goal of the
season, assisted by Mark Knobloch,

The Washington and Lee track
team captured four second places at
Mary Washington College’s Battle-
field Relays last weekend.

At Friday’s field events, Mike
McAlevey and John Carder were run-
ners-up in their events. McAlevey
threw the javelin 178’ 6’’, while
Carder pole vaulted 12’.

Saturday’s track events saw fresh-
man Andy White take second place in
the 110-meter hurdles with a time of
15.3. The W&L sprint relay team of
Chris Ives, John White, Chris Bleggi
and Mark Pembroke finished second
behind Frostburg State. The team’s
finishing time was 3:31.2.

legs at three different distances. The

head and controlling the game. All
was quiet until junior attackman
Todd Breithaupt decided to stir
things up. Breithaupt made things
closer with his first goal of the
season.

The first period was important in
the Generals’ development this sea-
son, They proved they could come
back. W&L did come back against
Maryland on March 16, but this was
the first time in '85 that the Generals
were able to come back to prevent an
early blowout.

Daly said the Generals were’ “out-
played” in the second period, but
they weren’t outscored. With 6:48 left
in the half the Tigers’ Mullins scored
for the second time in the game, this
time ona clear, making the score 5-3,

The Generals needed goals, and
they soon got what they needed. With
1:06 left in the half, Deringer took ad-
vantage of a man-up situation to
score his second of the day and cut
the margin to one goal. Then Rod
Santomassimo opened the field up on
a breakaway and found Deringer for
the hat trick to tie the game up at the
half as the teams went to the locker
rooms at the intermission.

runs 400 meters and the anchor
(Pembroke) runs 800 meters.

Although team scores are not kept
at invitational meets, head track
coach Norris Aldridge maintains that
there is still team identity. ‘But you
concentrate on your own event,’’ he
added. Coach Aldridge continued:
‘“‘We compete as a team but are pri-
marily concerned with bringing our
individual times down.”’

He added that his teams usually
face very tough competition at invi-
tational meets. Aldridge concluded
that the work on individual times and
competition against tougher oppo-
nents prepares the Generals to de-
fend their crown at the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference outdoor
championships.

On April 20, the Generals will tra-
vel to Greenville, S.C., to compete in
the Furman Invitational. On April 27,
the Generals will host the ODAC out-
door championships at Wilson Field.

  
 

  
 

When the teams headed back to the
field for the second half, nothing had
changed: There was still mist, mud
and cold. But with 12.47 left in the
third period, the score did change.

Junior attackman Bill Holmes
teamed up with Deringer to get his
first score of the game and give W&L
the lead. Towson, after a 3-0. dry
spell, figured a reply was in order.
Three minutes later, Winkoff came
from behind the goal to get his second
score and tie the gameatsix.

Things began looking much like the
first period again when Conley took
advantage of a man-up and scored
unassisted with 9:14 left in the
quarter. But that lead didn’t last, as
Deringer got his fourth on a return-
the-favor assist from Holmes.

The seesaw battle continued when
the Tigers capitalized on another
man-up situation. Mike Policastre
gave Towson the lead at 8-7.

The fourth period saw the tension
mount when Conley added his second
goal of the game to give the Tigers a
two-goal lead with 11:44 left toplay.

Sandy Brown then cut the lead to
one with an unassisted goal. With
1:03 left, W&L got the break it was

looking for — another man-up situa-
tion. But the Generals did not score
with the man advantage, and the
game ended at 9-8.

Assistant coach Sam Carpenter de-
scribed his feelings with a movie
reference. ‘‘You know how [Chief]
Inspector [Dreyfuss| gets that ner-
vous twitch around Clousseau in Pink
Panther movies? That’s how I get
when people mention Towson State.”’

The Generals did have some fine
individual performances, however.
Goalie John DiDuro had 16 saves de-
spite the funny bounces in the mud.
Rich Schoenberg continued his domi-
nation of the face-off, winning 17 of 21
attempts. W&L also recovered 61 of
56 percent of the ground balls.

Daly is proud of his team despite

the current slump

“I think the team has represented
W&L well. They've played and train-
ed hard and continue to work as hard
as 33 players can,"’ he said. ‘I wish
we could have picked up a win here
or there, though, as positive rein-
forcement,”

Mack with his sacrifice fly to left
field, and Zahn singled home Chris
Militello, who was pinch-running for

In action earlier in the week, W&L
dropped three of four contests with
its only victory coming in a double-
header against Emory & Henry.

Last Thursday, W&L lost a 10-1 de-
cision to Virginia Military Institute.
Schoettelkotte pitched three score-
less innings before allowing the Key-
dets to tally twice in the fourth. VMI
ran its lead to 8-0 before the Generals
could score their lone in the seventh.
The Keydets scored twice more in the
seventh.

W&L split an ODAC doubleheader
with Emory & Henry Saturday, los-
ing the first game 8-7 and winning the
second 8-4.

The Generals carried a 4-2 lead into
the fifth inning in the first game
before letting E&H take command
with a six-run inning that made the
score 8-4. W&L’s comeback effort in
the seventh fell one run short as the
General could score only three runs.

In the second game, the Generals
went ahead 2-1 in the second and
never looked back. W&L scored runs

“T think fencing has tremendous
advantages over more popular
sports. You never have to give it up,”’
he said. ‘Twenty years after college,
I’ma better fencer.”’

Worth, who was third in saber in
the Big Ten when he was at Ohio
State, credits his father with helping
him to choose the sport. “‘I can’t ever
remember not being interested in
fencing. My father was interested in
fencing but never seemed to have

he said.

cut to three in the bottom of the in-
ning.

E&H made it 6-4 in the sixth, but
the Generals put the game on ice in
the top of the seventh by adding two
moreruns.

Tuesday, Eastern Mennonite once
again proved to be too tough for the
Generals as W&L fell 8-1 at home.

Just as in EMC’s 16-0 win over
W&L earlier this season, Doug Byler
baffled the Generals hitters as he pit-
ched a six-hit complete game. EMC
scored twice in both the second and
third against starting pitcher Schoet-
telkotte. Any hope of a Generals
comeback was killed in the top of the
ninth when EMC scored four times to
make the score 8-1.

Despite his team’s 1-7 ODAC re-
cord, Murdock remains steadfast in
his optimistic outlook for the season.

“T still believe that we have a
shot,”’ Murdock said. ‘We still have
an outside chance of finishing in the
top four in the conference.”’

‘These are the times that will help
later on,’’ Murdock said. ‘These
guys are learning how to deal with
adversity. I just hope we keep our
heads up and keep working hard
This has been a frustrating part of
the year.”’

The Generals’ next game is April
16 at Lynchburg.

qualifier

As a child, Worth recalls waving
sticks in imaginary sword fights and
seeing sword fights in movies. When
he was 15, he joined a Dayton YMCA
fencing class and began his formal
instruction.

Worth hopes to have increased par-
ticipation in fencing at W&L, espec-
ially with the transition to coeduca-
tion next fall. ‘This year we had five
or six [fencers] return to the club,
but we need about nine for a colle-
giate team with a backup.... There is
a women’s club in Virginia, and
women here would be able to com-
pete,’’ he said.

Linksters outshot by LBC

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee golf team,
sporting a changed lineup to test
some of its depth, was defeated by
Liberty Baptist on Friday in Lynch-
burg.

W&L carded a team total of 324 for
the afternoon, 12 strokes behind the
312 total of the hosts.

The Generals left their top four
players at home for the match, ac-
cording to team member William
King. But it was not the decreased
manpower that hurt the W&L effort.

“I think Liberty Baptist just played

really well,’ said King, indicating
that the W&L total of 324 was only
two strokes higher than the regular
team’s score last week against LBC.

Leading the Generals was fresh-
man Chip Gist, who turned in a 78. He
was followed by classmates James
Sowersby (80) and Andy Parkey (83)
and senior Mike Lehman (83).

LBC’s low card wasa 75.

The team will take two weeks off
for exams and resume competition
with the Shipbuilders Invitational
Tournament on April 19. The Old
Dominion Athletic Conference Cham-
pionships are slated for May 2-3 at

April 4, 1985

 

 

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

The latest art work on display at
the du Pont Gallery is receiving
some rave reviews.

‘Best show yet,’ ‘‘excellent,”
“intriguing’’ and ‘‘very impres-
sive in quality and quantity” are
just some of the comments made
by visitors to the gallery.

Obviously, this is no ordinary
show. Little, if any, of the art on
display will ever appear in public
again, not because it is of extraor-
dinary value or quality, but be-
cause of the artists behind it.

The sculptures, paintings and
sketches in the show were done by
students in the art classes at
W&L. For most of them, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance to have
the public see their work. After
the show is over, they will gather
up their creations and cart them
off to their rooms or give them to
parents of friends or even throw
them away.

The variety of work is astound-
ing. Entering the gallery, one en-
counters elementary sketches of
fledgling artists side by side with
oil and watercolor paintings. Mo-
dern sculptures of twisted and
warped metal and polished wood
lay scattered along shelves and
tables.

For many students, especially
those who have just taken their
first art course, seeing their art on
display is the end of a process that
began with an interest in learning
to create and ended with the de-
velopment of that ability

Paul Abbott and Alex Castelli
are twoexamples.

Abhott said he has alwavs been

interested in art but had never
been able to pursue that interest
After receiving instructions in the
basics of drawing from W&L art
Professor I-Hsiung Ju, drawing
comes naturally to him now, he
said.

“It’s intimidating when you
first start. It's hard to draw justa
little bottle or vase,” Castelli said.
“You figure you have to be an ar-
tist to get something in the show.
You're overwhelmed when you
see your work in there, consider-
ing some of the other work they
have inthere.”’

Mark Herman, who exhibited
his work in the student show last
year, said many people are sur-
prised at the quality of the work.

 

 

 

“It’s incredible how much you
can progress and have people ac
tually interested in buying some
of your work,’ he said

Joe Videler said having his art
in the show meant a chance to get
some reaction to his work.

“It's nice to be in the show be-
cause art is to be looked at,” he
said. “You get feedback from
other people.”

For Paige Wingert, having his
work inthe show has been a profit-
able experience, literally

He said he had not intended to
sell the sculpture, a series of

The idea to put such a high price
on the piece came from a visit toa
Roanoke gallery. He explained
that everything there had such a
high price that he thought that it
might improve the image of his
work by doing the samme thing

“If people looked at the price,
they might think the piece was
really good just because of the
price,’ hesaid.

Wingert said that unlike most
artists, he did not have any sym-
bolic meaning in his work.

“It's an aesthetic thing. The
wood and design are beautiful,”
he said. ‘‘People say that modern
art is meaningless, but does art
have to be a perfect image of
something?”’

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Student Art Show in du Pont Gallery features a variety of art work
by W&L students. The show, which has received positive reviews, runs

through next Friday, April 12.

Lime Kiln slates three

 

By TIM RICHARDSON
Staff Reporter

 

The Lime Kiln Theater will present
three plays, including a world pre-
miere, in its first full season this
summer.

The repertory theater company,
which began last summer with a li-
mited run of ‘‘Rock Kiln Ruin’s Tale
of Cymbeline,”’ will premiere ‘‘Stone-
wall Country,’ a play based on the
life of Stonewall Jackson and written
by Don Baker, the company’s pro-
ducing director.

In addition, they will also repeat
“Cymbeline,”’ an adaptation of the
Shakespeare play of the same name,
and will perform ‘“‘Red Fox/Second
Hangin,”’ a play acclaimed by critics
during its off-Broadway run.

Like ‘‘Stonewall Country,’ each
was written or adapted by Baker and

is set in Southwest Virginia.

Again this summer, the company
will consist of professional actors and
will perform at the Festival Theater
at Rock Kiln Ruin, west of Lexington.

In preparation for the upcoming
season, which will run from July 19
through Aug. 25, Lime Kiln Arts Inc.,
the theater group’s parent company,
has conducted a $50,000 fund drive, to
raise money to pay promotional and

_ production expenses.

According to Liz Butler, the com-
pany’s office manager, the organi-
zation reached its goal of $50,000 last
week. She added that the drive,begun
four weeks ago, will continue until
the end of the month.

Besides money collected by the
fund drive, the organization also re-
ceives revenue from grants made by
foundations and corporations and
from ticket sales.

No excuse

Nabobs nattering again
with new members, name

 

By JOHN WINTERS

There was no excuse when the
Nabobs broke up last December.
Area groupies thought they'd be at a
loss for ‘local talent.’’ Since Febru-
ary, however, things are better than
anyone could bepe for — there's a
new band.

Two former Nabobs recently have
teamed up with two of W&L’s very
own calendar men. Made up of third-
year law student John Miller and
seniors Landon Banfield, Marshall
Young (Mr. May) and David Wood-
ham (Mr. April), the band plays late
sixties and early seventies rock-and-
roll.

Despite Banfield’s claim that their
new name came about because they
thought of themselves as originally
as an excuse for a band, it was clear
from the start that ‘‘The Excuse’’
was nothing of the sort.

The band currently plays two of its
own compositions. One, “Girl of My
Dreams,” was written by Young,
lead guitarist and vocalist. The sec-
ond is a Chuck Berry instrumental
with lyrics by Miller, called
‘Suzanne.’

After having only four practices,
the band made its debut at Zollman’s
Pavilion on Feb. 9. Since then, it has
played at two fraternities, Hollins
College and the Cockpit.

Each of the members has played in
other bands in the past, but this band
is different. Woodham, who shares
lead guitar with Young, points out
that ‘this will be the last hurrah
before we hit the job market.”

Despite slight stylistic and sound
problems, normal in any new group,
individual talent is clearly evident.
With only a small number of formal
practices, the band consistently im-
proves and puts out quality perfor-
mances.

More than 300 people heard them at
the Cockpit last Friday.

Miller, who continues in the role as
drummer from his old Nabob days,
credits the group’s early success to
“having three great lead guitarists in
one band,’ and as he modestly adds,
“one adequate drummer."

Young echoed Miller, saying, “The

wav we sound is a tribute to every-
one’s expertise.’’ He also praised
their soundman, junior Nick Berents,
saying, ‘‘He gets a lot of the credit for
how we sound.”

Berents admits that he did not
know how to work a sound board
when Miller and bassist Banfield,
who used to play lead guitar for the
Nabobs, asked him to handle the mix-
ing.

“I didn’t have a clue on how to
work a sound board, so I went down
to Roanoke and learned how to oper-
ate one,’ Berents said. He says he
can now handle the minor trouble-
shooting problems, but judging by
their performances last weekend at
the Cockpit and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, he does a much better job
than that.

The band has progressed from four
excellent individual musicians to a
solid unit. One of the more notable
points of this group is that unlike
most new bands, you can actually
understand what these guys are
singing.

Vocals are split between Miller and
Young, with backgrounds coming
from Banfield and Woodham, who
adds, ‘‘when I have to.”’

Obviously, the band enjoys what
they're doing almost as much as
their audience. Young said, “‘It’s fun
making money doing something you
like," while Woodham, who the
others call ‘the experience,’’ adds,
‘‘We'll play anywhere for money.’

Banfield believes ‘‘our new group
blows the Nabobs out of the water.”’
Miller agrees, admitting the stage
has had a positive effect on their
“social life’’ as well.

That the band is gaining in popular-
ity and appeal is without question.
They plan to play again at Hollins on
April 26 and will back up Skip Castro
at the Rocklands on May 1. They are
also hoping to play at the University
of Virginia in addition to continuing
at W&L.

For the diehard fan who hasn't
been able to grab a souvenir (Wood-
ham’s Michael Jackson hair curl,
Banfield’s patent leather vest, Mil-
ler’s earring or Young's innocence)
there’s still hope. The band is plann-
ing on selling buttons . saying,
‘What's Your Excuse."’

Without a doubt, there's no excuse
not tosee this band.
