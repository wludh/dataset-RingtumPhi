Mr. FD takes a stroll through the SAB Mink Dynasty

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Supplement Editor

 

Once again, it is time for Mr.
FD and his date to take a stroll
through the Warner Center and
Doremus Gymnasium to gaze in
awe at the Spectacle provided
them by the Student Activities
Board with a re-creation of
China right here in Lexington for
the 78th Fancy Dress Ball, ‘The
Mink Dynasty.”

As has become customary,
Mr. FD will be guided to Warner
Center on March 8 by giant sear-
chlights that can be seen
throughout the southern Shenan-
doah Valley. As he approaches
the entrance, he will move along
a garden walkway lighted by
candle-bags.

The stairs leading up to the en-
trance of the Warner Center will
be covered by a red carpet and
the whole area will give Mr. FD
the feeling of being in the midst
of an orchard of cherry blossom
trees.

As Mr. FD escorts his date up
the stairs, he will no doubt notice
the large Chinese gong on his
right. From there, he moves
through the large gateway en-
trance and into the garden area.

Once inside, Mr. FD will feel
as if he has stepped right into a
lush Chinese garden. On his
right, he will see a goldfish pond
with floating lily pads. A small
bridge will go over the pond,
which will be surrounded by a
bamboo fence.

To his left, he will notice that

the athletic trophy showcase has
been replaced with several co-
lorful exotic birds.

As Mr. FD moves further on,
he will no doubt first choose to
enter Warner Center. The War-
ner Center will be decorated in a
mood that brings thoughts of old,
dynastic China.

Blue, white, gold and red ban-
ners with calligraphy drawn on
them will drape the ceiling. On
both sides of the room, a large
dragon mural will adorn the
walls.

Scattered about the room will
be a number of tables where Mr.
FD can rest as the night wears
on. These tables will be decor-
ated with bright Chinese floral
arrangements.

Performing in the Warner
Center Friday night will be the
Count Basie Orchestra. Over the
bandstand will be a large pagoda
that reaches toward the ceiling.

When the orchestra is taking
breaks, Mr. FD will be enter-
tained by a Chinese dance troupe
performing traditional Chinese
dances such as the ribbon dance.

When Mr. FD turns away from
the bandstand and looks to the
balcony area, he will see that
this area has been made to re-

.semble the Great Wall of China.

From the 400 level of the War-
ner Center, Mr. FD can climb up
the stairs of the Great Wall to
reach the 500 level balcony area.
Here, he will see more tables
and on the walls there will be
patterns of Chinese fans that
range in size from small, hand-

Moving around the balcony
area will be small acts entertain-
ing all the happy (we hope) FD-
goers. These acts could range
from fortune tellers to jugglers
to a lady on roller skates with a
boa constrictor.

Leaving the balcony area and
returning downstairs, Mr. FD’s
next stop will be the 400 level of
Doremus Gym. Doremus will be
decorated to give the feel of a
Chinese New Year.

The upper balcony will be co-
vered with cherry blossom
branches, and Chinese lanterns
will be strung across the ceiling.
Along the walls of the gym will
be decorated scrolls, and plans
are to have symbols for the var-
ious Chinese New Years adorn-
ing the area in between.

The entertainment in Dore-
mus Gym will be provided by
“A” Train and Otis Day and the
Knights. Mr. FD was a little dis-
couraged when he discovered
there would be no mantle to dive
from, but he realized that some
order must be kept to ensure
that all the FD-goers get the
most out of their Mink Dynasty
experience.

Tickets for the 78th Fancy
Dress Ball go on sale Monday at
a cost of $30 a couple. Fancy
Dress memorabilia also can be
purchased at the same time.

And don’t forget — if Mr. FD
wants to get an early start on his
Fancy Dress weekend, he can go
to the student activities pavilion
the Thursday before Fancy
Dress for a concert with Wild
Kingdom and the Four Tops.
Tickets for this show also go on
sale Monday and are $6.

The Bid

For some, season began in December

 

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

It was no coincidence that
Mary Baldwin College threw an
expensive party with Liquid
Pleasure Tuesday night. The
party’s purpose? The Bid.

It’s every Washington and Lee
man’s most powerful bargaining
tool. But only those fortunates
who have yet to succumb to
hometown pressure can legiti-
mately play the exciting ‘“‘I-
don’t-have-a-Fancy-Dress-date”’
game. Time is running out, how-
ever

‘“The closer you get to FD, the
better looking the girls get until
this weekend. If they haven’t
gotten The Bid by this weekend,
they have probably given up,”
senior Gray Sanders said.

Women who have never been
on campus before and may
never be here again until next
February are showing up.
Everywhere. The parties are
packed; there are special road
trips to Graham-Lees; even the
library is full of scheming
women. No place is sacred.

Yet these women don’t realize
that the only W&L students who
can study this close to The Ball
have already extended The Bid.
Even the students without dates
are starting to sweat. Margie
Copson, a sophomore from
Hollins College, agrees.

“It seems late in The Sea-
son...girls I know were looking
as early as January. If I didn’t
have a date by now, I would have
probably given up,”’ she said.

Yet Copson also said she
thinks that women are not exact-
ly “hunting” for a date at W&L
parties, but rather primarily
just having fun. A Sweet Briar
College senior who asked not to
be identified echoed a similar
idea.

‘The way to get a date is to go
over and have fun as often as you
can but not try too hard. Guys
usually see that pretty well,’’ she
said.

“You have to start being ‘seen’
early — as early as December,”
she continued. ‘But guys get
really cocky and they at least as-
sume that girls are all out for the

same thing — an FD bid.”

She added that the pre-F'D par-
ties have ‘‘every girl within a 50-
mile radius. The only difference
in the parties is the competitive-
ness and the tension between the
girls. They guys just sit back and
become spectators for the girls
who are trying to get a date.”

WA&L junior Bill Hanna agrees.
“T would say the guys would be a
little more cocky because they
think the girls are there just to
get an FD date.”

Blair Eddy, a freshman at
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege agreed that W&L students
have the upper hand for now, but
not for much longer.

“Yes, girls here are still look-
ing for dates this week. I think it
would be a little rude to ask one
next week, though,”’ Eddy said.
“But I think first of all the girls
are there to have a good time
and second of all to get a date.
It’s no big deal for the girls who
don’t get dates.’’

Kerri Castigan, a junior at
Mary Baldwin, went one step
further.

“I know a couple of girls who
have turned down FD dates be-
cause they wanted to go to Flor-
ida for spring break. I think
freshmen are more apt to look
for dates but I don’t think it’s a
big deal. Once you go, I don’t

think you feel that it is as big to
miss another one.’’ Castigan
said she also is impressed by the
increased courtesy shown by
W&L men at this time of year.

“IT think the guys are much
more polite and outgoing,’’ she
said, ‘‘because they are looking
for a date and they don’t want to
miss out.”

Freshman Brandt Wood
agrees that a lot of maneuvering
is going on.

‘A lot of guys are withholding
the coveted bid until late. But I
would imagine that everybody
would like to have given The Bid
out by now to avoid the pre-FD
panic that is setting in,’ Wood
said.

The mind games are every-
where. Signs for parties that are
taken to the women’s colleges
still display, ‘FD dates
available.”’ Guys at the parties
will even walk around with these
signs on their backs. But this
late in the game, it’s like reach-
ing into the Kentucky Fried
Chicken basket for some white
meat after your seven older
brothers have grabbed their
pieces.

90 students, faculty
taking dance class

 

By TIM RICHARDSON

 

Staff Reporter
British essayist Alexander
Pope once said, ‘They move

easiest who learn to dance.”’

For about 90 Washington and
Lee undergraduates, law
students and faculty members,
Pope’s statement is being pro-
ven true, thanks to ballroom
dance lessons taught by Frank
Roupas, a Roanoke dance in-
structor.

During the past six weeks, on
Wednesday nights, Roupas has
instructed his pupils in the basic
steps of the jitterbug, waltz,
tango, rhumba, cha-cha and fox-
trot. He hopes to have them
ready in time for the Fancy
Dress Ball on March 8.

“If you can walk, you can
dance. In 29 years of teaching,
I’ve never had a failure. I work
with each student,’’ Roupas
said.

Roupas, 45, said most of his
students at W&L take the class
to prepare for Fancy Dress, but
quickly added that his classes
are useful later in life.

“You aren’t going to disco ata
governor’s ball,”’ he said.

Lesley Conradi, a third-year
law student taking Roupas’ class
for the second time, agreed.
“It’s a social skill that helps
later in life,’’ she said.

W&L art history Professor
Gerard M. Doyon said it is never
too late to learn how to dance.
Doyon, who is several years old-

er than the other students in the
class, said, ‘‘I went to an all-
boys’ high school, an all-boys’
college and then joined the Ar-
my. I never had a chance to
learn to dance until now.”’

This is Roupas’ second year of
teaching classes at W&L. Be-
sides W&L, he teaches at the
University of Virginia, where he
has 400 students, the Greenbrier
Hotel, several community cen-
ters and churches and private
homes.

“I’m the only dance instructor
who makes house calls,’’ he said

Roupas’ students appear to en-
joy his classes. Part of the rea-
son is the enthusiasm and en-
couragement that he brings to
the classes. Throughout the
class, he is clapping, singing and
dancing.

‘“‘Wasn’t that wonderful,’’ he
says in a Lawrence Welkian ac-
cent after watching his students
demonstrate their skills

At first glance, Roupas does
not fit the image of a good dan-
cer. He is tall, about 6 feet, 3 in-
ches, and appears almost awk-
ward. But when the music
starts, he gracefully glides
across the floor in perfect time.

His expertise has led to two
television appearances, one on
the ‘‘Lawrence Welk Show,”’ the
other at a New Year’s Eve party
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in
New York City.

When asked why he teaches,
he replied, ‘‘Ballroom dancing
makes people happy, and I like
to see people happy.”’

The Count’s music lives

When Count Basie was honor-
ed at the 4th Annual Kennedy
Center Special Awards Ceremo-
ny in Washington, D.C., in 1981,
he was introduced by another
jazz great, Henry Mancini.

‘“‘No one and no one band has
contributed more to American
music than Count Basie,” Man-
cini said.

And, indeed, his assessment of
the man who dominated the jazz
band scene for almost 50 years
may be correct.

Although the Count Basie Or-
chestra that plays in the Warner
Center next Friday night as the
main band of the Fancy Dress
Bal! will be without its name-
sake leader, who died last April,
the band and Count Basie’s
music live on.

William Basie, an only child,
was born Aug. 21, 1904, in Red
Bank, N.J. His first musical
training came from his mother
and a ‘‘wonderful German lady
named Holloway” who gave him
piano lessons and charged 25
cents a session.

Basie’s first instrument choice
was drums. But Sonny Greer, a
boyhood friend, made Bill move
elsewhere after some early com-
petition.

Basie played the Harlem clubs
in the early 1920s. ‘‘Piano’’ was
the instrument of the day, and
the most important influence of
Bill’s playing style was Thomas
“‘Fats’’ Waller — infallible touch
and strong harmonic sense.

The Count then toured the fa-
mous T.O.B.A. ‘‘wheel,’’ the ma-
jor vaudeville circuit for black
entertainers. Stranded once in
Kansas City, he signed up with
the Walter Page Blue Devils.
Shortly thereafter, ‘several
members of the band joined the
Bennie Moten Orchestra.

When Bennie died in 1935, Ba-
sie took over as the leader.

The Count Basie Orchestra
was born when John Hammond

heard them on the radio, got Wil-
lard Alexander interested, influ-
enced Basie to add to his nine-
piece band and, in 1936, brought
them to New York. Then it was
one peak piled on another. From
high-spot to higher-spot to great-
er achievement.

Basie was one of five honored
at the Kennedy Awards, along
with Cary Grant, Helen Hayes,
Jerome Robbins and Rudolf
Serkin.

Count Basie played on — in
concerts, at dances and special
events on TV specials and an-
nual tours to Europe and Japan
and frequent jaunts to other far-
away places. Bill and his band
grew more popular than ever
before, year after year.

“Retire?’’ Basie would repeat
with disdain when the question
was raised, as if the word and its
meaning were strangers to his
life.

William James ‘‘Count”’ Ba-
sie died April 26, 1984. The last
sentence of the obituary read:
“Your melodies will linger in our
hearts forever.”

Freddie Green, who was so
much a part of the Basie magic
almost since its beginnings,
spoke glowingly and prophetic-
ally, a few years ago, about the
Count and the way, musically,
he prepared an entrance at the
end of his solos for the next man:
“He leaves the way open.”
Count Basie left the way open for
the Count Basie Orchestra.

From rude to extravagant:
planning a $65,000 ball

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

“It’s amazing to me that we do
all this for a four-hour ball,”’ said
Dain Dulaney, chairman of the
Student Activities Board’s Fan-
cy Dress Ball committee. He
was sitting among the rude be-
ginnings of the soon-to-be extra-
vagant decorations for the 78th
Fancy Dress Ball, the theme of
which is ‘‘The Mink Dynasty.”

Dulaney wasn’t speaking only
of the Oriental screens hand-
painted and decorated with dra-
gons, or of the other decorations
the SAB is assembling in the stu-
dent activities pavilion. He was
talking about a six-month opera-
tion that will have cost about
$65,000 and involved 60 SAB
members as well as many mem-
bers of the Lexington communi-
ty by the time the festivities
come to a close one week from
tomorrow night.

The Theme
The planning for Fancy Dress
begins in the fall when the SAB
directors start kicking around

ideas for the theme of the ball.
One of the first steps is to check
a list of themes from the past
balls, and try to come up with a
related concept or an offshoot of
an old theme.

‘‘Most of the themes have been
done in some form or variation
in the past. This year’s theme,
I’m not real sure it’s ever been
done before. It’ll be a new and
hopefully real colorful theme,
something that will be kind of
exciting,’’ Dulaney said.

From these lists, the directors
come up with a broad-based idea
which, Dulaney said, have been
“clever, or ‘a visit to: ,’ or some-
thing like that.”’

This year’s theme started as a
Oriental idea and evolved into
“The Mink Dynasty.’’ Last
year’s theme began as thoughts
about South America and be-
came the “‘Lost Cities of Gold.”’

Although ‘‘everybody has in-
put’’ into the decision on the
theme, Dulaney said it is the
Fancy Dress chairman, the SAB
chairman, the board’s executive
director and a couple of other
people who finally decide what

the theme will be. With 60 mem-
bers-at-large on the board, Dula-
ney said that this procedure has
proven to be the easiest and he
added that nearly everybody is
happy with the end result.

The directors brainstorm and
discuss and narrow their ideas
down until they arrive at a
theme. This is usually done by
the beginning of January, and
this is when the rumors and
speculation begin. When the
theme is chosen, only the direc-
tors know what it is. The rest of
the SAB is kept as much in the
dark as the rest of the Washing-
ton and Lee community until
just before the ball.

Dulaney worked this year with
the Fancy Dress committee,
something new this year, which
was part of the general reorgan-
ization of the SAB. The commit-
tee was told a week or so ago
about the theme, and the rest of
the SAB was let in on the secret
at Tuesday night’s board meet-
ing.

There is good reason for keep-
ing the theme secret, Dulaney
said. It revolves around the
SAB’s sale of Fancy Dress me-
morabilia. The T-shirts, posters
and cups that the board sells
make a good deal of money, Du-
laney said, and that helps keep
the cost of Fancy Dress within
reason. If the SAB can keep the
theme under wraps, it can main-
tain exclusive sale of the
memorabilia and use that
money to defray the operating
expenses of the ball. Keeping the
ticket price down for the stu-
dents is one of the main concerns
the SAB has in its Fancy Dress
planning.

There have been instances in
which other people have produc-
ed Fancy Dress items. ‘“‘We’ve
had problems in the past with
people turning stuff out. We run
into problems with that because
we copyright what we do — the
theme basically. We don’t want
to prosecute anybody.”’

members on how the decorations should be put together.

The Bands

The other major decision the
SAB must make for Fancy Dress
is the choice of entertainment.
The first and most important
part of the entertainment that
must be taken care of is the big
band. Dulaney said there is an
incredible demand right now for
orchestras because there aren’t
new big bands starting up any-
more. Since the orchestra is a
crucial part of the ball, the SAB
lines one up early in the year.
The Count Basie Orchestra was
booked in October for this year’s
ball.

The rock and roll bands are
booked later because there are
more variables regarding their
performance. Concert tours,
band break-ups and competitive
bidding with other organizations
all are among the factors that
must be considered.

Charged with this responsibili-
ty are SAB entertainment co-
chairmen John Haywood and
John Crawford. The rock bands
are contacted sometime in Feb-

ruary and the SAB tries to match
schedules with some of them.
The SAB then bids for a large
number of bands and chooses
one that will fit its budget.

“The way things worked out
this year, we got some real good
deals,” Dulaney said.

The Decorations

Also to be considered in pre-
parations for the ball are the de-
corations that will transform
Warner Center into the Far
East. ‘‘We try to construct and
design most of our stuff from
materials we can make, because
it usually costs less,’’ Dulaney
said. The procedure for decorat-
ing for the ball operates in much
the same way as does the theme
decision. A broad conception of
how the decorations will look is
the first step, From here, SAB
members begin to look for decor-
ations for the ball. This year,
Dulaney said, SAB executive
director Michael Guerriero went
to New York City to look for
decorations and things have
been ordered from Houston and
from all over Virginia.

At that point, when the decora-
tions and theme are determined,
the real work begins for the rest
of SAB. Most of the board, the
members-at-large, do not partic-
ipate in the decision-making but
play a big role in the implemen-
tation of the decision. What this
means is that they spend three
hours a day at the pavilion con-
structing decorations and doing
everything necessary to put on
the ball.

There are certain rewards for
this work. Each SAB member
receives free tickets to the ball,
a free T-shirt and a free poster.

Especially helpful in all the
preparations, Dulaney noted,
are the people of Lexington.
They show great interest, he
added, and their help in getting
the materials together is essen-
tial and something the SAB is
grateful for.

The announcement of this
year’s Fancy Dress theme ends
the months of secrecy that have
surrounded the event for almost
as long as there has been a Fan-
cy Dress.

Student Activities Board En-
tertainment Chairman John
Haywood said the theme used to
be revealed muci: earlier since
Fancy Dress was originally a
costume ball and people needed
time to get their costumes
ready.

Haywood said that in the 1960s
the event became a more for-
mal, black-tie event.

He said that the curtain of
secrecy is kept over the Fancy
Dress theme for two reasons.

One is that the SAB tries to
build as much “hype’’ around
the event as possible. ‘The ele-
ment of secrecy adds glamour to
the event,”’ Haywood said.

Haywood added that it is very
important that people continue
to want to go to Fancy Dress and
the element of secrecy helps add
to the promotion of the event.

The second reason for theme
secrecy at Fancy Dress is more
of a practical one, but is none the
less very important, he explain-
ed

The theme of Fancy Dress is
kept secret until the very last
moment in an effort to make it
more difficult for those people
who wish to market “‘unauthor-
ized’’ Fancy Dress memorabi-
lia.

While at first that may seem to
bea stab at the system of capita-
lism many Americans hold very
dear to their heart, Haywood

said that bootleg FD memorabil-
ia has a direct effect on ticket
prices.

‘When we make $5 on the sale
of a T-shirt, it goes to keeping
the price of FD tickets down,”’
Haywood said. ‘‘When some
other guy makes $5, it just goes
into his pocket.”’

The budget for Fancy Dress is
nearly $65,000, Haywood said,
and that money comes from stu-
dent funds and from ticket and
memorabilia sales.

“We have to get the money
from somewhere,’’ Haywood
said. “If we don’t make it on
sales of memorabilia then we
have to increase the ticket
prices.”

Haywood said that bootleg FD
memorabilia, if left unchecked,
could increase the ticket prices
anywhere from $5 to $7.

While most people are content
to wait patiently in suspense for
the announcement of the Fancy
Dress theme, there are occas-
sions where individuals try to
find out before the SAB decides
to make the theme public.

Such was the case last year.
Rick Swagler, co-editor of The
Ring-tum Phi, had a friendly bet
with Haywood that he could find
out what the theme was going to
be. Swagler said he would not
print the theme before the SAB
decided to release it if Haywood
would tell Swagler if he guessed
the theme correctly.

' Swagler toyed with different
ideas about how to find out the
exact wording of the theme and
finally hit upon an idea that
worked. Upon learning the name
and location of the plastics com-
pany that was printing the FD
grain cups, Swagler went to
work,

Swagler called the company
and identified himself as a stu-
dent from Washington and Lee
University. He said he needed to
check the wording on the cup.
They read it off and Swagler re-
plied, ‘“Yep, sounds good to me.”’

Soon after that, Haywood re-
ceived a “‘panicked”’ call from
the plastics company, which was
not about to print thousands of
cups with a questionable theme
on them. They then proceeded to
Federal Express a cup down to
Haywood so he could double-
check the wording on the cup to
make sure it was all right.

Haywood said that everything

more serious side, Haywood said
that there was a slight chance

For those who do not heed
warnings of ‘‘Don’t try to do this

ficult, even impossible, for any
unauthorized person to learn the
theme of Fancy Dress before the
