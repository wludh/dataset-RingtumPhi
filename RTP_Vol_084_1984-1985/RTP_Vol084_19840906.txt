Shortened Rush, tighter rules spark criticism

By TED LeCLERCQ
Staff Reporter

 

New Interfraternity Council rules that
put greater constraints on the frater-
nities and additional pressure on the
freshmen drew criticism from fraternity
leaders as Rush began this week, even as
administration officials defended the
changes.

This year’s Rush program is the
shortest in recent years, with less than
two weeks separating the beginning and
end of the annual fall event.

A frequently voiced criticism concern-
ed the requirement that freshmen sign
up for their eight open houses after only
“no contact” days, effectively meaning
that they had to eliminate nine of the 17
houses without ever having visited
them.

New restrictions this year include no
alcohol, women or music at the 10 Rush
Dates, which begin this evening.

Bids may not be extended until the fifth
Rush Date, which is scheduled for Mon-
day, the first day of classes.

A sharply altered Rush program was
originally proposed by the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee on Fraternity Affairs, which was
formed last fall by University President
John D. Wilson. The committee was com-
posed of three students and four
members of the staff and faculty.

The final rules for this year’s Rush are
the result of a compromise between the
committee report, which proposed a one-
week Rush, and an IFC counter-proposal
for a three-week program.

Wilson said he advocates a second-
semester Rush, which he says would in-
terfere less with freshman academic per-
formance.

The president also said he would like to
see a shift in what he admits is the
widespread perception that he is ‘‘out to
get”’ the fraternities.

“Fraternities and Rush in particular
were in desperate need of reform when I
came here,” he said. ‘“Their numbers
had dropped from about 85 percent (of
Students) to 63 percent. That kind of

- decline should have signaled the frater-

nities themselves that they had pro-
blems.”’

“If I had wanted to weaken the frater-
nity system, why would we have spent so
much colonizing Sigma Nu?” he asked.
“T continue to have faith that this frater-
nity system can keep from going down-
hill.”

Dan N. Murphy, associate dean of
students for fraternity affairs, said that
although the shortened Rush period is un-

fortunate, it is possible to have a suc-
cessful two-week Rush.

“The calendar doesn’t make too many
people happy,” he said. “I’m not a total
advocate of what’s being done, but it’s a
compromise.’”

English Professor John M. Evans, who
chaired the ad hoc committee, is op-
timistic about the alterations.

“The freshmen may not have had time
to meet fraternity members before open
house sign-up, but we had a more specific
rush book to help them get ready,’’ he ex-
plained.

Fraternity presidents and _ rush
chairmen varied in their criticisms of the
new system, but were nearly unanimous
in denouncing it.

“Rush is way too short — it’s wrong,”
contends Phi Delta Theta President

Team seeks fifth sls season

By MIKE STACHURA _
Sports Editor

 

You’d think a football team that’s lost four of
five starters from its offensive line, including an
All-American, as well as half of its defensive
starters would look to merely survive the storm of
its next season.

You’d think that way unless you happened to be
playing football for Washington and Lee under
head coach Gary Fallon.

Fallon’s Generals go looking for a record-setting
fifth straight winning season Saturday afternoon
in the friendly confines of Wilson Field against
non-conference foe Dickinson.

W&L’s seventh-year leader sees a confident
group of upperclassmen taking charge of his 1984
squad.

“Our upperclassmen are going to settle for
nothing less than what we experienced last year,”’
he said. Last season the Generals finished at 6-3,
tied for second place in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference, had 11 players named to Aill-

Conference squads and broke six team and in-
dividual records.

Fallon is somewhat more reserved in his op-
timism, but says he is just as confident in his
players capabilities.

“The season could go 10-0, or it could go 0-10. I
just don’t know, but I do know that if we’re on our
game, we’re going to give people some problems.”’

“We’ve got to stay healthy, we’ve got to
prepare, we’ve got to maintain our high, positive
attitude, and,”’ he said, pausing, ‘‘the bounces
have got to go our way now and then.”

Offensively, the Generals return a veteran
backfield. Leading the way for W&L will be senior
tailback and tri-captain Gene Girard. The record-
smashing back earned Honorable Mention All-
America status while rushing for 1,011 yards, the
first General to eclipse the 1,000-yard barrier
since the end of subsidized athletics in 1954.

Girard is joined by last year’s starting quarter-
back, Bobby Wilson, who completed over 52 per-
cent of his aerials in 1983, blocking fullback Frank

indicted, jailed for Fiy1

ly the white limestone walls of
the building, killed sophomore
Thomas J. Fellin of Penn-
sylvania, who had been sleeping
on the second floor.

Less than a month before the
Lexington fire, Mesner was con-
victed on an arson charge stem-
ming from a dormitory fire in
New Jersey.

Mesner was arrested less than
90 minutes after the four-man,
three-woman grand jury return-
ed the indictments Tuesday. He
was at the Catawba Emporium,
a restaurant in Roanoke’s
Crossroads Mall where he work-
ed as a waiter.

In an exclusive telephone in-
terview shortly before four Lex-
ington and Roanoke County law
enforcement agents arrived to
take him into custody, Mesner
said he knew he was a suspect in
the fraternity house fire.

“Several of my friends were
questioned pertaining to this
event — whether they were with
me and whether they thought I
could have done it,”’ he said.

Mesner said he ‘‘knew the per-
son who died and one other’’ at
the fraternity. He said he knew
Fellin because ‘I dated his
girlfriend’s roommate.”

He said he learned of the fire
from friends who saw accounts
of it in the newspaper, and added
that ‘‘there’s no way I could
have done it.”’

“T was home at 12:30 on the
night of the fire and my parents
saw me,” he said. Police say the
Lexington blaze began about 4

learned he was being in-

ago, his attorney sent a letter re-
questing a meeting to Captain

conducted the interviews with
Mesner’s friends. Mesner said
Spence had not responded to the

Enough

is enough

University President John
D. Wilson says the school is
“not interested”’ in promoting
the admission of women to the
fraternities. Several schools
have done so following the
decision to admit women to
their undergraduate pro-
grams.

“The experiments that have
been tried in other places of
opening up national frater-
nities to women seem to me to
be neither successful nor
called for,’’ Wilson said.

“The argument for it is that
all university programs, even
fraternities, should be open to
students regardless of gender.
I don’t believe that follows as
necessary from anything I
know about collegiate life.”’

Review and Outlook

Speaking of Tradition

As we settle into Lexington for yet another year,
and the hustle and bustle of fraternity Rush and
Orientation Week evolves into the more mundane
routine of classes and the occasional party, perhaps
this is a time for Washington and Lee students to con-
sider both the past and the future of their venerable
institution.

Last year undoubtedly was memorable — drug
allegations, fraternity problems, and, yes, even the
necktie debate, dominated the news. Even more so,
though, last year will be remembered for the spirited
debate about whether to admit women undergrad-
uates.

With the Board of Trustees’ July 14 decision to
begin admitting women next fall, discussion of the
coeducation issue has decreased noticeably in the
first few days of this year.

This perhaps is not so bad. It gives us a chance to
reassess other aspects of the W&L experience while
preparing for the first class of women next year,
when further discussion and news should result.

Some are disappointed about the coeducation deci-
sion. Others are elated. Whatever their personal opin-
ions, most would agree that we have lost a tradition.

But while we may have lost one, let us not squander
the opportunity to retain others. One that easily could
be renewed is the speaking tradition.

A former student committee used to discipline
students who didn’t speak to each other when they
passed on campus. One would hope — indeed, insist
—that re-creation of that committee not be necessary.
Common courtesy and civility dictates that we — as
Washington and Lee gentlemen — greet each other,
whether on campus, in town or ina dormitory.

Washington and Lee prides itself — and rightfully
so — on its small size and personal atmosphere. What
better way to re-establish that pride and that reputa-
tion than merely to say ‘‘Hello’’ when passing some-
one on campus? It is the very least we can do to
preserve the future of this university.

This year could be perceived as a lull between the
storms. Let us take advantage of that respite to im-
prove the University and make it an even better place
for future generations of students — male and female
— toenjoy for years tocome.

And maybe we can even get some studying done.

Two views on Rush
Short Rush great for profs, not students

By NELSON PATTERSON
Editorial Page Editor

Death and taxes, some say,
are the only certainties in life. I
disagree. Add to that list one
more item — a lack of consensus
on how Rush should be run and
‘what freshmen ought to know
about it.

As an independent by choice,
not a lack of bids, I think Rush is
great. Sure, it is a bit unrealistic,
but what during the first few
weeks of school is normal? What
better way to get to know your
fellow students (‘‘brothers’’)
than to talk to them over plastic
filled with beer — er, I mean soft
drinks, with all the new rules
—while a line-up of attractive
belles giggle as compliments are
dished up by freshmen eager to
receive that bid? After all, that
is fraternity life, isn’t it?

Wrong.

And that is where we need to
examine the system in greater

detail. This year’s two-week

 

Khakis, not acne

By MIKE McALEVEY
and SCOTT HENDERSON
Phi Columnists

It’s that time again: incoming
freshmen, scheduling, matricu-
lation, meetings with advisers
and, yes, resumption of the
Washington and Lee social
habits. Of course, heading the
list comprising the latter is the
fraternity Rush scene.

My View

Not to miss an opportunity to
lure unaware and often insecure
freshmen, each fraternity has
strategically posted its Open
House sign-up booth directly in
the center of the freshman dorm-

 

rushed Rush is great for the pro-
fessors and no one else. Granted,
some hope Rush-wearied
freshmen will now attend class
more readily and get better
grades and perform just as pro-
fessors desire. Gotta whip these
boys into academic shape, they
say. Rush over a _ four-week
period is distracting.

But while their intentions are
good, they are also misguided.
The question here is not so much
the distraction and length of
Rush, but the role which frater-
nities (the traditional center of
social life at W&L) play in rela-
tionship to the University’s role
as educator and, for at least a
freshman’s first two weeks and
no more, surrogate parent. The
important decisions made dur-
ing Rush — including potential
expenditures for fraternity
membership of $5,000 over four
years — deserve greater atten-
tion than a two-week preview.

Reforming Rush is not easy,
nor is it necessarily the solution.

 

itories. Ask you: How is one ex-
pected to make his choice for
Open House dates? Simple.
Some houses use the sure-fire
deployment of beautiful females
to attract attention. Others may
rely on sheer numbers of cloned
fraternity men to generate in-
terest. The false representation
of the house by a couple of face
men has also been successful,
and this is only the first step
whereby our naive youth will be
transformed into model W&L

gentlemen.

Quickly comes the initial
period of evaluation itself — the
Open House. This evaluation is a
two-way street with both fresh-
men and fraternities trying to
create good impresssions while

Someone will always complain.
Delayed Rush — theoretically
the best alternative — means
financial havoc for frats and the
prospect of a two-semester
Rush, since freshmen would un-
doubtedly visit fraternities in the
fall anyway. The four-week
Rush, we were told, kept fresh-
men away from their studies ina
time crucial to forming study
habits for their college life. And
a two-week Rush means quick
decisions and little under-
standing of what frat life is all
about.

Perhaps one area which could
be helped is better informing the
freshmen about the fraternity
system. This year’s Rush Book
at least published the financial
figures and guidelines for
membership in each house. Per-
haps in the future, a letter to
freshmen prior to their arrival
on campus outlining the fraterni-
ty system would be helpful. In-

sportily clad freshman is
sported off to the house at the ap-

creates a veritable parade of

either apprehension or con-
descension, depending on the
point of view. Throughout these

brother makes his sage decision
as to which of the 10 Rush dates
is most fitting for each par-

Perdue ‘not really sausfi ed’ with Rush rules

The following is a partial transcript of a
conversation Monday among Interfraternity
Council President David Perdue and Ring-
tum Phi chief editors Bruce Potter and
Mike Allen, Perdue is a senior from Atlanta.

Phi: There are quite a few changes in
the Rush rules from those of previous
years. Are you Satisfied with the set of
rules you’ve been given to work with?

Perdue: No, I’m not really satisfied.
Rush is such a touchy subject. There’s no
really good way to do it...We’ve thought
about all the different options and how it
would be easiest on the freshmen and
easiest on us. A one-week rush has been
done in years past, and apparently it’s
been very successful in the past, 20 years
ago. But before it starts, it’s hard for me
to envision one-week rush being very suc-
cessful because I think a lot of people can
get left out.

Phi: Is the short schedule your main
concern and the reason you're not
satisfied?

Perdue: The fraternities would all love
to have more parties and everything. But
the freshmen aren’t as concerned about
not having as many parties as they are
that they’re narrowing it down to eight
houses without ever having met anybody
at any of the fraternities, and I think that
a lot of people may get missed. With 17
fraternities, if you narrow it down to
eight, you may get missed by a fraterni-
ty, or you may miss a fraternity you like.
I’m a little concerned that some people
may get missed, but we’ll just have to
see. I plan on setting up some kind of
committee after rush is over that’l] go on
all year and try to doa little bit of evalua-
tion and try to come up with a little better
system for next year.

Phi: Rush for you all was five weeks,
then it was four, last year it was three,
and now we’re down to two. What does
this mean? Is this a trend to no Rush at
all?

Perdue: Well, the option of delaying
Rush until maybe after Christmas has
been toyed with. The option of having it
long is pretty much out — I don’t think
they like the idea of a long Rush, which is
understandable when the freshmen are
up here, and right off the bat get thrown
into all that confusion. Something’s got to
be done to appease both sides. The
freshmen have got to be protected, and
the fraternities have to be protected...

Phi: The argument, usually, against
the delayed Rush is financial. Is that
such a concern that that could never be a
reality here?

Perdue: The financial burden would be
hard on the fraternities, but I imagine
they could survive that. I think if ... they
had a delayed Rush, then it would be no-
holds-barred for three months before
that actual Rush started. If it’s put off un-
til after Christmas, I think it would be no-
holds-barred Rush from day one anyway.
That’s a certain possibility. That’s a fault
against that and a fault against the one
we have now because after two weeks it
may continue to be a no-holds-barred
Rush anyway.

Phi: There’s a perception that with the
shorter Rush period and with these dif-
ferent rules, that there’s going to be a lot
of dirty rushing and perhaps more rule-
breaking than we’d expect. Do you think
that’s a valid perception?

Perdue: Dirty rushing is always going
to take place, regardless. I think maybe
people feel pressured in this one week
and they have to go a lot faster in the one
week to make up for a lack of time, sc
maybe dirty rushing will take plaee...

 

 

By Cotton Puryear/The Ring-tum Phi
IFC President David Perdue

 

 

 

 

Dorm counselors are going to be keeping
a lookout and, of course, the IFC judicial
board’s going to be keeping a lookout.
Other than that, I can just call on
everybody to play by the rules as best as
they can.

Phi: There seems to be a perception
that Rush rules are made to be broken.
Does the IFC expect some infractions
here and close its eyes to some rules and
not to others?

Perdue: A lot of times, they honestly
aren't brought to our attention. There are
expected to be infractions, certainly. You
can’t expect anything otherwise...
Whatever’s brought to our attention,
we'll just have to dole out the
discipline....

Phi: You mentioned that in the short
time, there may be a lot of people left
behind. Do you think that deferred Rush
will become a bigger thing now than
perhaps it has been in the last few years?

Perdue: It may. I hope it will. I hope
that everything works out as best it can
during that week and a half, and then I
hope that people don’t just’ completely
drop the idea. I hope that deferred Rush
does continue. It’s not kind of talked
about in the past, it’s just kind of
something that goes on. There’s not real-
ly any guidelines or rules, But I’d like to
see a lot more deferred Rush and I'd like
people to keep their interest up. Cer-
tainly, there may be a lot of people that
are going to be left out. Deferred Rush,
on their own, without rules or organiza-
tion, is fine.

Phi: You mentioned that there’s a very
short time for the freshmen to evaluate
the houses. Let’s look at it the other way
for a moment. Is this a very realistic way
for the houses to evaluate the freshmen?

Perdue: That’s certainly possible. I
see a lot of problems in that. After sitting
around and drinking iced tea and Coca-
Cola and talking with a guy for an hour
and a half, a week later you have to
decide whether to invite him to join your
fraternity for four years. So, there’s cer-
tainly a lot of room for that to happen;
it’s just going to be up to the individual

fraternities to handle that problem.
Hopefully, we can figure out a better
way. I don’t mean to sound negative
about Rush at all; I think it’s going to
work out very well... think really,
basically, it’s a good plan. I’m a little
concerned with how short it is, but if
everything all the older men I’ve spoken
to have said is true, it shouldn’t be a pro-
blem. I’ve spoken with a lot of people
who’ve said they went through a one
week Rush ... they said it’s no problem.
You just have to be on your toes for that
week and really concentrate on just look-
ing at these guys and really getting
organized about it.

Phi: With all the discussion about the
fraternity system and coeducation and
the shorter Rush, is this going to be a
more intense Rush than in past years?

Perdue: Oh, I’m sure it will be a more
intense Rush. You’re going to have to be
more intense if you’re going to compete
with other houses for freshmen. You’re
going to have to be intense, I think.

Phi: Is that a good thing, to be that in-
tense? Does it give the freshmen the real

idea of what fraternities are all about?

Perdue: We’! just have to say I really
don’t know. I can’t really tell.

Phi: You’re familiar with all 17 houses.
It’s no secret that some of them are
fighting for their survival with this Rush.
Without naming them, how many houses

: are in that precarious position?

Perdue: When they start letting girls
here, there are going to be some houses. I
don’t want to put out a number, I really
don’t but there are going to be some
houses that are just going to diminish.
There are such small numbers, there’s
no way they can survive...This is going to
be a crucial year for those houses.

Phi: At least one administration has
used the term ‘‘eating club,”’ in which,
rather than the bid-and-accept system,
you’re assigned to a fraternity. As cer-
tain houses get weaker and we get the
women here, is that something that
perhaps some people see down the road
for our fraternity system?

Perdue: This is an important year for
all the fraternities. We’re just going to
really have to dig in our heels, and I think
the Interfraternity Council is going to
have to become a much stronger body,
and the fraternities are going to have to
realize the position they’re in this year
and just make a better self-image for
themselves so they can continue (with
the girls here). I don’t see that the frater-
nity system has to get weaker with the
admission of girls here, but we have to
prepare this year. I think this year we
have to put off a better image and we
have to do better for ourselves. This year
being important, what I’m trying to say,
we’re just going to have to dig in our
heels and be prepared for when the girls
get here, because a lot could happen
then.

Phi: You're saying that if you don’t
project a better image, then down the
road you might become something along
the lines of ‘‘eating clubs’’?

Perdue: I really don’t know.

Phi: Which rules are going to be en-
forced most stringently? What absolute-
ly should a house not break? What rules
are safe to break or fudge on?

Perdue: The rules that I would say are
absolute are no contact rules, which is, of
course, the most important ones,

because a lot of times the freshmen are
just bogged down. Dormitory rush is go-
ing to be a lot less. We want to let the
freshmen go up to the dorms and escape
the whole bit of that during the day and

then be able to go through Rush at night.
The alcohol rules are absolutely impor-
tant. No alcohol at these things. The con-
tact rules are important and taking the
freshmen to and from a fraternity and
not letting them stay around there after a
Rush date. If there’s a party afterward,
they have to take them back, and let the
freshmen choose to come back to that
house.

Phi: Are there any rules safe to fool
around with?

Perdue: Of course, I don’t want to say
that there should be any of these rules
broken. The only rules that are a little bit
intangible are just the dirty rushing
rules, where fraternities portray another
fraternity as being not what it really is.
That always takes place, and there’s no
way to control that kind of stuff. All these
rules, of course, should be followed, and I
really can’t see any that could be skirted.
Usually, the ones that are broken are the
contact rules. Every year, somebody has
freshmen where they’re not supposed to
be or they’re having parties when they’re
not supposed to be having one and there
are freshmen there.

Phi: The dominant feeling of some of
these houses is, we’ll take the fine. It’s a
very deliberate thing. Is there a way to
avoid that? Can you make it painful
enough that those rules won’t be broken?

Perdue: I said at the IFC meeting the
other night, that if these rules are broken
then social probation is going to go along
with that. And that’s going to start up as
soon as Rush is over, and so if a house
wants to portray an image to a freshman
that maybe hasn’t torn, they’re going to
be completely crippled for the next two
weeks, and they can’t have any kind of
parties, or any kind of action, or anything
for two weeks after Rush is over, so
that’s a pretty lousy way to start the
year.

Phi: Are there any big changes in the
rules during pledging?

Perdue: I think hazing has always
been, of course, frowned upon in the past
and strongly frowned upon. This year,
it’s going to be watched after a lot close-
ly. The dorm counselors are going to be
brought in; we’re just going to keep a
strict eye. The administration is, of
course, completely, fed up, with it.

Phi: At what point do you start enforc-
ing it?

Perdue: We’ll just have to decide case
by case. I don’t think W&L ever really
has had a bad problem with hazing, not
like a lot of other schools I’m familiar
with.

Phi: The fraternities are sort of under
fire at this point, some people think, from
the administration and the community.
What are some of the things, specifically,
that the fraternities can do that are con-
structive, that will give them a better im-
age?

Perdue: Well, the fraternities are
under a little bit of fire right now, but I
think we have generally pretty much
support. Of course, most of the alumni
are very supportive of us, and I think that
the administration is even somewhat
supportive, but they would just like to see
a little better image portrayed by the
fraternities, and I can certainly see room
for that. A lot of times it seems like all
the fraternities are just drinking clubs,
and we’d like to portray a little better im-
age. There’s a lot the fraternities can do.

We’d like to get a little more involved
—you know, not just be those big houses
in the middle of town — but be a little

Rush

Reynolds Thompson. ‘‘We stepped up our
summer Rush, but the really bad part of
the formal Rush is those guys having to
sign up for Open Houses before they have

even been to the houses.
‘Nobody knows how bad it will be,”’ he

added’ ‘‘Maybe it will be better than we
think.”’

Gray Sanders, president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, had a similar observa-
tion. ‘‘This year’s freshmen have been
cheated,’’ he said.

“Rush is way too short — 14 days to
choose a fraternity for four years means
there are going to be more misjudgments
on both sides than usual.” ;

Sanders also protested the ban on
females at Rush Dates this year. “‘It’s
ironic that we've let girls into the school
but taken them out of Rush,”’ he noted.

Kappa Sigma President John Haywood

 

 

says the new system ‘‘will only weaken
the fraternity system.”

“It’s ridiculous to think that freshmen
can make a good decision by eliminating
half the frats before they have seen any
of them,” he said. ‘‘They think it’s like
pulling a Band-Aid off a cut. The quicker
it’s done, the less it hurts.”

“The whole idea of Rush system is to
give everybody a fair chance, and the
two-week Rush doesn’t do it,’’ agreed
Sigma Chi President Bobby Pifer.

“It’s shifting the emphasis from school
tosummer Rush, and I think Rush will go
on an extra week here after formal Rush
ends.”’

A number of other house leaders
echoed the view that ‘‘deferred Rush’’
will become increasingly important for
freshmen.

“Rush will continue another couple of
weeks after formal Rush ends,’’ Beta
Theta Pi President George Seavy said,
“It just won’t technically be considered
Rush.”’

“I can see not having beer at Open

Houses, but I don’t understand why we
shouldn’t be allowed to have it at Rush
Dates,”’ he said.

“The new system is going to hurt the
frat system,’’ he concluded. ‘‘Maybe
that’s why it was done.”’

Pi Kappa Alpha President Jamie
Nance said he ‘‘came to W&L for the
social life as well as for the academics.”’

“The key combination is to have smart
students and a strong social life,’’ he
said. ‘‘I want the social life of Gainesville
(University of Florida) with the
academics of Harvard.”’

“TI got it here but they are destroying it
with the intensified party regulation,’’ he
continued. ‘‘The Hill wants to eliminate
about six of us, and this new Rush system
is just designed to crush frats. A two-
week Rush is like kindergarten. It’s like
a teacher giving assigned seats.”

Phi Kappa Sigma President Jim Cobb
sees a possible advantage to the new
system. ‘‘No beer and no girls may give
the guys a better idea of the house — a
real chance to get to know the group bet-

”

ter.

Sigma Nu Rush Chairman Mark
Fishman sharply denounced this year’s
Rush scheme, “It is my belief that the
administration is trying to get rid of
some fraternities with this vastly
shortened Rush,’’ he said.

“T believe that Rush not interfering
with academics is good, but they are go-
ing about it in the wrong way. It’s going
to choke off potential fraternity
members.”

Head Dorm Counselor Bob Tomaso
said ‘“‘many of the freshmen are totally
clueless about fraternities.”’

“Under the system where they can
pledge in a week and a half, I think
there’l] be mistakes all around and a lot
of depledging,’’ he said. ‘‘Whoever made
up this Rush claims they are trying to
protect freshmen by making it quick, but
they really are not.”’

“This pseudo-Rush system is not really
helping them get to know the frater-
nities,’ Tomaso declared. ‘‘It’s kind of
scary.”

Mesner was convicted in Bergen
County Superior Court of setting
an October dormitory fire at
Fairleigh Dickinson University.

A school spokesman said
Mesner was enrolled as a fresh-
man mechanical engineering
major at the time of the fire, and
withdrew following his arrest on
anarson charge on Oct. 22.

Chief Burke said Mesner
received a 30-day suspended
sentence, a $1,000 fine and $50 in
other fees.

Bill Carey, director of public
relations at Fairleigh Dickinson,
said the dormitory fire there
consisted of ‘‘a pile of smolder-
ing paper which gave off enough
smoke to set off a nearby smoke
detector and which was found in
the center of the first floor of the

Carey said the fire caused lit-
tle damage. ‘“‘Mesner was sim-
ply in the area and it proved out
that he had been responsible for
the fire,’’ he added.

Mesner said in the telephone
interview that his prior criminal
record includes ‘“‘traffic of-
fenses’’ and the New Jersey
charge.

“They put me up and tried me
along the same lines as the Lex-
ington case — criminal mis-
chief,”’ Mesner said, adding that
he thought the verdict was
“rather unfair.”

Mesner lives with his parents
on the Hollins College campus.
His father, Thomas Mesner, is a
lecturer in history and a
reference librarian atthe school.

Three former students
indicted by grand jury

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

Three former Washington and
Lee students were among the 20
individuals indicted on drug
charges Tuesday in the wake of
a special grand jury investiga-
tion of local drug trafficking.

A Rockbridge County grand
jury returned indictments on
more than 60 counts of drug-
related felonies, including
possession or distribution of co-
caine, marijuana, LSD and
psilocybin (a hallucinogen deriv-
ed from mushrooms).

The seven-month special
grand jury investigation includ-
ed interviews with more than 200
local residents, including the
W&L president, dean of students
and student body president; the
Virginia Military Institute
superintendent and comman-
dant of cadets; the mayor of
Lexington; and other local of-
ficials.

Records of W&L’s Student
Control Committee, which has
jurisdiction over drug-related
disciplinary matters, were
sought by and turned over to the
special grand jury.

from W&L in the spring of 1983,
was indicted on six counts of
distribution of cocaine between
September 1982 and March 1983.

John H. McLarin of Rich-
mond, who was a senior at W&L
in 1983, was charged with two
counts of conspiracy to possess
cocaine in Lexington.

One of McLarin’s roommates
said he was traveling in Califor-
nia and unavailable for com-
ment.

Marshall L. Shearin Jr. of Nor-
folk, who was a senior last year,
was indicted on four counts of
distributing cocaine in Lex-
ington between December 1982
and May 1983.

Shearin could not be reached
for comment. His father said
Shearin had no previous drug
charges against him.

Former VMI cadets indicted —

by the grand jury included:
Steven J.P. Bruening, charged
with two counts of distributing
LSD; Dana Holladay Neal, in-
dicted for possession with intent
to distribute marijuana; Jeffrey
R. Pack, charged with six counts
of distributing psilocybin; and
Vernon R. Perdue, charged with

distribution of LSD and
psilocybin.

Special grand juries are in-
vestigative bodies which

prepare recommendations for
regular grand juries, which may
then act on indictment requests.

The drug panel issued a report
recommending about 60 indict-
ments, according to Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts
III.

Law enforcement officials
were unwilling to specify which
of Tuesday’s indictments arose
from the work of the special
grand jury, but Lexington Police

College ‘basics’

telephones

By PAUL SMITH
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Ring-tum Phi has com-
piled the following to help
students with some of the
“basics” of college life:

* unecking accounts. Although
students may want to keep their
home checking account, local
merchants and bankers recom-
mend that students also open
Lexington accounts.

A spokesperson for Dominion
Bank, N.A., said, ‘‘Students
have difficulty keeping records
of the checks they write.’’ Other
bank representatives also noted
that the time delay associated
with clearing checks and receiv-
ing financial statements from a
home bank make having a Lex-
ington account advantageous.

Lexington has three major
banks, Dominion Bank, United
Virginia Bank and First
American Bank of Virginia, all
of which are branches of state-
wide banks.

First American, 22S. Main St.,
allows free checking as long as
the customer’s balance is more
than $200. If it falls below that,
there is a $4 service fee.

United Virginia, 45 S. Main St.,
both require a $300 minimum

have 24-hour automatic teller
machines.

A spokesperson for First
American said it would have a
machine by the end of October.

Remember, for an interest-
checking account, customers
usually need to keep a greater
minimum balance to avoid a
monthly penalty.

¢ Cable television. The Lex-
ington Cable Co., 5 W. Nelson St.,
installs cable service for $25, and
there is an $8 monthly charge.

The Home Box Office channel
can be received for another $9.50
a month. Among the regular
cable channels available in Lex-
ington are Cable News Network,
ESPN, WTBS from Atlanta,
WTTG and WDCA from Wash-
ington and the Washington and
Lee student-operated station,
Cable Channel Nine.

Because of the influx of in-
stallation orders, students who
order cable now will have to wait
until at least Oct. 4 to have it
hooked up.

¢ Post Office Boxes. Rental of

a regular size box is $20 a year,
and $1 of this will be returned

when you turn in your key at the
end of the year.

If you’re still looking for a box,
there are plenty left, according
to a spokesman. ‘‘We’ve com-
pletely filled the main post office
(on the corner of Lee Avenue
and Nelson Street), but we have
many left in the annex (on Jef-
ferson Street next to Domino’s
Pizza).”’

¢ Telephones. The Student
Telephone Union at W&L helps
lessen the cost of telephone ser-
vice for the students, explained
chairman Chris Carter, a
sophomore. A student who joins
STU does not have to pay the $75
deposit to the Central Telephone
Co. of Virginia, or Centel.

In turn, STU guarantees that
Centel will receive the money it
is due. Carter explained that the
STU membership fee ($7 for
first-time members) does not
cover the installation fee (for
those not living in a dormitory),
about $41.80, or the activation
fee.

Centel’s business office is at
102 E. Washington St., and an
STU representative will be there
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. the re-
mainder of this week. The STU
office is in Room 209 of the Stu-

Mid East weavings displayed in duPont

An exhibit of historic and con-
temporary woolen handweav-
ings from the Middle East will
open the 1984-85 season in
Washington and Lee’s duPont
Gallery.

“Tribal Textiles” from the col-
lection of the Sun Bow Trading
Company in Charlottesville will
go on display Monday, Sept. 10.
The exhibition will continue
through Sept. 28.

In connection with the exhibi-.
tion, Saul Barodofsky and Anan-
da Cronin of the Sun Bow
Trading Company will present a
public lecture at 8 p.m. on
Wednesday, Sept. 19, in duPont
Auditorium. The lecture also is

free and will be followed by a.

reception.
“This is the first textile exhibit
that we have had in the duPont

   

Gallery in quite a long time,”’
said gallery director Debora
Rindge. ‘The exhibition
features a great variety and in-
cludes works from different
tribes as well as contemporary
and ancient pieces exhibited side

by side.”

Most of the items in the exhibi-
tion represent the work of
nomadic tribes and were ac-
quired on the village level by
representatives of the Sun Bow
Trading Company.

rumors) and freshmen will still
find greater fascination in the
lure of the Greek houses than in
the classroom. Social life, in the
short run, will still center around
the fraternities.

My advice to freshmen in
Rush is simple. There does exist
social life beyond fraternities,
and with coeducation, the frater-
nity you join this year may not
exist next year. Search and
decide carefully. Remember
that the stage has sets you'll
never see again and all the ac-
tors have the same lines. But
most of all, enjoy it. It will never
be the same again.

dress, physical attributes and
the Open House date attended. A
fiber of polyester places one in
the 5-8 date category in most
houses, while a dapper navy
Brooks Brothers jacket, Duck-
head khakis and Sperry top-
siders may earn a top spot on the
roster. Long hair, acne, facial
hair and earrings bite the big
one. Weak handshakes, sweaty
palms and nasal mucous are
definite no-no’s that are con-
sidered far more important than
academic or athletic ability or
brotherhood potential. One can
discern initial impressions by
the brothers’ comments such as,
“T like the **** out of him,’ or
“He a good ****er.”’ Either of
these dubious honors should be
good for the privileged 1-4 Rush
Date category.

Regardless of one’s perform-
ance in the Open House prelimi-
naries, advancement into the
precarious second round of Rush
Dates is assured. The number of
each person’s Rush Date should
cue him as to what his chances
are for that elusive award of ap-
proval known as a bid. A number
1 denotes profound interest,
whereas a 7 or 8 is far less en-
couraging.

The crowning achievement
each one strives for is the bid.
This decision, of course, is arriv-
ed at by the brothers through no
easy means. Painstaking delib-

eration often leads to heated
debate which occasionally
erupts into violence of a sub-
human nature, whereby more
animosity is generated than is
brotherly love.

What does all this work from
both parties result in? Golden
showers of beer, a din greater
than that evoked by a Ted
Nugent concert, songs sug-
gesting perverted sex acts,
humanly impossible feats of
alcohol consumption and the
maladies associated with both.

This article is not intended as
an indictment of the entire
fraternity system — quite the
contrary, in fact. The social
function the houses serve with
respect to organizing activities
with our sister schools, in-
tramurals, and promoting in-
teraction among W&L students
is commendable. The problem
lies in the lack of time permitted
by a compacted early fall Rush
both for freshmen to become ac-
quainted with the various frater-
nities and for the brothers of the
house to be able to make sound
judgments as to the acceptibility
of the freshmen. After all, which
is more important — the finan-
cial security of the houses during
those early weeks of the fall, or
the proper academic adjustment
to the rigors of college studying
and the ability to make a well-
informed fraternity choice?

Fraternities accountable for
actions, Chief Sutton says

 

By JON MILES
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton feels he’s developed a
strong, positive relationship
with Washington and Lee frater-
nities, but he says that won’t pre-
vent him from “enforcing all
laws fairly and completely.”’

Although there are no plans to
increase patrols during Rush
beyond the two to six cars nor-
mally on the streets, Sutton cau-
tioned that fraternities are ‘‘ac-
countable” for their actions.

Sutton cited excessive noise
and alcohol consumption as the
most pressing concerns of his
department during the two-week

Rush period and during other
major party weekends.

“Many times, the noise can
get out of control if people are
drinking,’ Sutton said yester-
day. ‘‘The two seem to go
together.”’

Sutton added that the police
are obliged to investigate any
complaints or violations of
“noise permits’ ‘‘amplified
sound permits,’ actually
—issued to houses.

The sound permit form re-
quires the name of the individual
running sound equipment in a
house, and that person is respon-
sible for violations during or
after party hours.

Liquor consumption will be
monitored by the police as well

as by the state’s Alcoholic
Beverage Control board.

Although Chief Sutton said
he’s ‘‘not one to smell drinking
cups,”’ public possession of open
bottle or cans is actionable. If a
minor is found in posession of
alcoholic beverages, the frater-
nity can be held responsible.

The A.B.C. now has an agent
permanently assigned to Rock-
bridge to Rockbridge County,
Sutton said, since the agenit*y.has
recovered from an earlier man-
power shortage.

Sutton, a U.S. Army veteran
with 30 years of police ex-
perience in Virginia, reminded
the fraternities that they ‘‘are a
part of this community and
should abide by its rules.”’

Chief L.O. Sutton said that
“there was information contain-
ed in the report that was of
assistance to us.”’

He said that ‘‘a number’’ of the
indictments he sought and
received stemmed from the
special grand jury probe.

“There are other drug in-
vestigations pending and some
of them may very well have
resulted from the special grand
jury investigation,” he added.

Rockbridge County Sheriff
S.M. Reynolds said the in-
vestigation provided informa-
tion that law enforcement of-
ficials ‘“‘just had to check out.”

“We've acted on everything
we’ve checked out,” he said.
“There are more still to go.”

Honts said he “went through

the exercise’’ of impanelling the
special grand jury because he

respected the request of Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. “John” Read. Sutton and
Read had joined in Read’s re-
quest.

“If it were prescribed to me
again, I would grant it again, in
that context,” Honts said.

“Any time that you have im-
formation and couple that with
awareness and education, you
have a better community.”

Pi Kappa Alpha
President: Michael
Lehman

Rush Chairmen: Jamie
Nance and Bill Metzger
Description:

The house is a three-story
red brick structure located
at 106 N. Main St. Some of
the characteristics of our
typical member include
responsibility and well
roundedness.

Differences:

From a very geographical-
ly diverse bunch of guys,
we have a good mix of
leaders, scholars and
athletes.

Independents?

No, not unless they’re in-
vited.

 

Zeta Beta Tau

President: Jay Boggs
Rush Chairman: John
Riley

Description:

Diversity best describes
the brotherhood of ZBT.
Our members come from
all across the country and
pursue a wide variety of
academic and extracur-
ricular activities, including
journalism, the arts and
business. We emphasize
the idea of the ‘‘social’’
fraternity through a varied
social calendar, enhanced
by our new Little Sisters
program.

Differences:

With 28 members, ZBT is
one of the smaller houses
on campus. We find this
smallness to be not a
burden but an asset, ensur-
ing each member’s in-
dividuality, yet giving us
an uncommonly strong de-
gree of brotherhood. We
also have better food than
any other fraternity could
ever think of having.
Independents?

Of course.

 

Sigma Phi Epsilon
President: Thomas W.
Todd

Rush Chairman: Matt
Coudert

Description:

Sig Ep believes that an im-
portant part of one’s col-
lege experience is the
knowledge gained from
meeting different people
with different views and
lifestyles. The house
stresses the pursuit of
academic excellence while

offering its members an ac-
tive social life. The word
“brother” can describe
any member of the frater-
nity. Although many of the
members are from dif-
ferent parts of the country,
there is a close link be-
tween the members. To
characterize a_ typical
Sigma Phi Epsilon brother
would be almost impossible
because of the diversity of
each member.
Differences:

Many fraternities seem to
be composed in a geogra-
phical sense — members of
a certain fraternity seem to
be from one region of the
country. The members at
Sigma Phi Epsilon repre-
sent all sections of the
country from the West,
Midwest, Northeast and
South. Another major asset
is our location. Our position
is away from _ the
mainstream of college ac-
tivities, thus giving its
members a chance to
relax.

Independents?

Absolutely.

 

Phi Kappa Sigma
President: Jim Cobb

Rush Chairmen: Caulley
Deringer and Roger Dun-
novan

Description:

We have no ‘“‘typical’’
members. We have athletic
captains to Phi Beta Kappa
members. We don’t look. for
any one kind of person. It
would therefore be difficult
to describe our house to an
outsider and give him any
kind of accurate idea. The
guys in the house are all
very unique in my opinion.
Differences:

Again to try and describe
what is different about our
house would take away
from what we have. The
difference is in our
members. I am proud of
what we do at Phi Kap. The
way we keep our house, the
way we conduct ourselves
— but our most outstanding
aspect is our members.

Independents?

The IFC has just adopted a
resolution which limits par-
ties to fraternity members
and their invited guests. It
is therefore our policy to do
just that. Limit the parties
to our members and invited
guests only.

4
ue

Pi Kappa Phi

President: Edward But-
tarazzi

Rush Chairman: Scott
Waterman

 

Description:

The brotherhood of Pi Phi
represents a very diverse
range of social back-
grounds. We have always
thought that it was the
diversity upon which we
draw our strength. There-
fore, there is no one
description for a typical
brother. Prospective mem-
bers are chosen upon their
merit, not upon their
demographic and
economic backgrounds.

Differences:

The characteristics men-
tioned above can partially
answer this question.
Another difference is that
our brothers concentrate
on unity within the house,
not on conformity to the na-
tional fraternity.

Independents?

We have always prided
ourselves on the attraction
of ‘“‘non-fraternity” stu-
dents to our parties. Unlike
many fraternities we have
no parties that are con-
sidered ‘‘closed.”’

President: Fred Bentley
Rush Chairmen: Chris
Lion and Tom Hurlbut
Description:

At Lambda Chi Alpha, we
believe that a fraternity
ought to be a place to foster
close friendships in the
spirit of brotherhood.
Essential to the strength of
this brotherhood is diversi-
ty and individuality. Thus,
our members come from
throughout the country and
from various backgrounds.

Differences:

Lambda Chi is different
from the other fraternities
in several ways. Most im-
portantly, we have aban-
doned the outdated system
of pledgeship and hazing.
In short, our associate
members are accorded all
the rights and respon-
sibilities of a full, active
member. Furthermore,
Lambda Chi is involved in
the community and on
campus with several social
and philanthropic projects.
For example, we recently
raised $500 for Stonewall
Jackson Hospital and
tutored at Lexington High
School.

Independents?

Although official Rush ends
in two weeks, Lambda Chi
Alpha will continue to seek
new brothers. Therefore,
independents are always
welcome to come by and
further acquaint them-
selves with our fraternity.

Beta Theta Pi

President: George Seavy
Rush Chairman: Kreg Kurtz
Description:

Betas are a sociable, easy
going group of guys.
However, there is no
typical member. Members
come from all parts of the
country and represent a
cross section of the W&L
student community. Just
about anyone can feel
welcome at the Beta house.
Differences:

The Beta house is compos-
ed of a diverse group of
students who enjoy all
aspects of college life, in-
cluding student govern-
ment, academics, athletics
and social life. Betas have
traditionally been campus
leaders in these interests
and proudly continue to do
So.

Independents?

After Rush, our policy is to
welcome invited guests to
our parties.

AN

Delta Tau Delta
President: Rich Gatti

Rush Chairman: Paul Fearey

Description:

Although most of our
members come from the
Northern part of the United

‘States (Maryland, Mass.,

N.Y.), we do have mem-
bers from Louisianna and
Virginia. Most members
are or have been active in
sports in and out of W&L.
Our typical member is
casual and laid back —
rarely seen in coat or tie.
We like to party but are
also active in other ac-
tivities — intramurals,
raising money for Multiple
Sclerosis in the spring and
an alumni newsletter.
Differences:

Our house is not hung up on
where a person is from, but
what he is like as a person.
Weare very social minded.
We are a smaller house
than others, but feel this
does have its advantages —
we are a Close house which
does a lot together. Delt
does stuff with other houses
— we are not isolated from
them.

 

 

The Ring-tum Phi last week sent que:
nities on campus. The questions w
understanding of what the various hoi
answers to the following questions are r

1. How would you describe your ho
characteristics of your typical member

2. In what way is your house different

3. After Rush, are independents gene

 

Independents?

If they are friends of the
members, independents
are generally welcome to
parties. It is impossible to
support the partying of all
independents on our finan-
ces alone.

 

Kappa Sigma

President: John Haywood
Rush Chairman: Mike
Hutcherson

Description:

Kappa Sigma is a tradi-
tional fraternity whose
members believe that a
fraternity is more than just
a social organization. The
diversity and commitment
of our membership have
always been our major
strengths.

Differences:

We believe that our pro-
gram is the strongest and
most well rounded on cam-

pus. Our goals are sincerity -

and straightforwardness in
Rush, a good social life
with civility and the
development of a strong
fraternal _ relationship
among our members.
Independents?

Yes.

Rush Chairmen: Bill
Bloom and Scott Vanmeter
Description:

We are a very diverse
house with members from
both the far North and deep

erson M. South. We have numerous
campus leaders including
Jack Ruf- dorm counselors and both
captains of the football
; team. We were the first
p of well- house on campus and we
iuals. Our have now the newest house
ny high in on campus. Most of our
all as in in- members are very athletic.
ics. Many Differences:
participate I think we are different
ts and we because we really are all
in student good friends and do things
€ govern- together even outside the
sphere of the house. We
also interact with other
ipt to mold houses well because of our
‘9a certain involvement with school
, we en- activities and the friends
'idualism, we meet there. We have a
‘y diverse less rigidly structured

Rush than most houses and
are therefore less _pres-
surized. We start out with a
small pledge class and
usually end up with one of
the largest. Last year we
had 20.

Independents?

Yes, we have always used
an open door policy with
the W&L community.

Sigma Chi

President: Bobby Pifer
Rush Chairmen: Jim
Rikhoff and Greg Stites
Description:

Sigma Chi works with a
philosophy of balance with
diversity. Many members
are involved in varsity foot-
ball, soccer, track, tennis
and water polo. Our mem-
bers are representative of
various areas of the coun-
try. Academics, while
strong, are not hindered by
our active social program.
Differences:

Along with our diversity,
Sigma Chi maintains a con-
tinual sense of unity that
prevails throughout the
house. The members are
highly motivated and ex-
cell in all areas of campus
life, whether academics,
athletics or social.
Independents?

We have always had a
policy of accepting anyone
who meets the mandatory
drinking age and acts
responsibly. Many of our
friends did not join a house,
but are always welcome at
our house.

 

Sigma Nu
President: Kelley Ar-
mitage
Rush Chairman: Mark
Fishman

Description: .
There is so much diversity
in our house that it is dif-
ficult to find a_ typical
member. Almost everyone
in the house is from a dif-
ferent state. We have about
50 percent ‘‘Northerners”’
and 50 percent ‘‘Southern-
ers.’’ Some of the brothers
are into sports and some
are not. The common link
between us is our strong
brotherhood — this is true
regardless of where we are
from. Our house does strive
for academics first.
However we believe that in
order to have a strong
academic life we must
have a strong social life,
and we do.

Differences:

Our house is“ different
because we just started it
up again last year. Most of
the juniors ‘in our house

were freshmen who went
through Rush in 1982-83.
However we ended up
pledging Sigma Nu even
though we did it after Rush
was over and even though
we had no house. As stated
before, our house is more
diverse than any house on
campus. We do not look for
people who are from cer-
tain areas of the country
—instead we look for quali-
ty men.

Independents?

Yes.

 

Phi Delta Theta
President:
Thompson
Rush Chairman: Stewart
Speed

Description:

Describing my house to an
outsider (as you put it), I
would basically refer to the
Phi Delts as a solid bunch
of guys, meaning we work
hard (as can be witnessed
by the number of school of-
fices Phi Delts hold) and
we play hard like most
fraternities do. But I think
what separates us from
other fraternities...is the
amount of leadership with-
in our house, including Ex-
ecutive Committee Presi-
dent and Vice President
and the president ‘of the
Senior Class. Also, I think
our house has proven itself
to be one of the more stable
fraternities on campus
throughout the years.
Differences:

Again, I think it’s the
leadership in the house. In-
deed, as I’m sure you are
aware, many of the frater-
nities are ‘‘regional,’’

Reynolds

although this is somewhat _

unfortunate because it.
quite often eliminates peo-
ple based on where they
are from, this is the case,
and yes, I guess Phi Delts
consist mostly of men from
the Southeast.
Independents?

Our parties are generally
open to members and in-
vited guests.

 

Chi Psi

President: Henry Dewing
Rush Chairman:
Kinkead and Chris Jakubek
Description:

Chi Psi is a very diverse
house. Our brothers live in
15 different states, play on
five different University
athletic teams and are in-
volved in many other areas
on campus and in the com-

George

munity. We have brothers
on ROTC and academic
scholarships as well as
brothers on academic pro-
bation. There is no “typi-
cal’ Chi Psi brother.
Differences:

I think we’re perceived on
campus as an ‘‘academic
house.” Although we do
well academically, we
aren’t an ‘‘academic
house.’’ Each brother
strives to do his best in
whatever he does. This is,
however, a personal com-
mitment. That’s what we
look for in Rush — men who
will strive for excellence in
all things.

Independents?

After Rush independents
are generally welcome.

 

“For any of those people
interested in coming by
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, we
encourage you to stop in
and see the house,’’ said
SAE President Gray
Sanders. The house is at 205
E. Washington Street.
David Perdue and Thorn-
ton Brooksbank are the co-
Rush Chairmen.

FIJI

While most houses have |
only Rush on their minds
this year, Phi Gamma
Delta is faced with the task
of rebuilding its house, gut-
ted by fire last spring.

“We've already got some
plans drawn up and they
look really good,” said Fiji
President Alex Castelli.
“The outside will be pretty
much the same, but the in-
side will be much more
space efficient.’”’

Castelli said the walls
that remained standing
after the fire are being
tested this week to deter-
mine whether or not they
can be ifcorperated into
the new structure.

“We recovered some-
thing in the neighborhood
of $400,000 from the in-
surance company, and
we’re hoping to be all mov-
ed in by the fall of ’85,”
Castelli said.

Castelli said Fiji is op-
timistic about this Rush.
Working out of a house on
Henry Street hurts a little, :
he said, because it is not
near many other houses.

Even so, he _ added,
“We're all really sticking
together through all of this
and we’re putting out a
very concentrated effort to
make this a good Rush.”’

Summer News Update

 

Col Alto conveyed

Ownership of the historic Col Alto property on
East Nelson Street has been transferred from
Washington and Lee to Laura Fletcher of Bel Air,
Md., in an out-of-court settlement signed in July.

The settlement ended a three-year legal battle
over the property, given to W&L by Laura Tucker
Mason, Mrs. Fletcher’s sister, in 1957.

Mrs. Fletcher had filed a $1 million lawsuit
against W&L in U.S. District Court in Roanoke. In
the suit, Mrs. Fletcher alleged that W&L had not
lived up to the terms agreed upon when Mrs.
Mason gave the property to the school.

The 1957 agreement between Mrs. Mason and
W&L said that if for any reason W&L ‘‘no longer
desires or is able to retain the premises under the
conditions set forth herein, it will convey the
premises to those persons then living who shall be
determined to be the next of kin of the owner.”’

The building had been used primarily for
storage as well as for housing students and occa-
sional informal social functions. Several pro-
fessors also lived in the outbuildings, or
‘dependencies,’ of Col Alto.

The Col Alto property, near the Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity house, includes a 17-room house
and several surrounding buildings on eight acres
of land.

Col Alto was built in 1827 for James McDowell,
who was governor of Virginia from 1843 to 1846 and
a member of the House of Representatives from
1846 to 1851, For many years, it was the home of
Harry St. George Tucker, who was dean of the
W&L Law School from 1899 to 1901.

Wise wins awards

Dr. John H. Wise, professor of chemistry,
recently won first-place awards in two categories
of computer graphics at the Biennial Chemical
Education Meeting at the University of Connec-
ticut.

Dr. Wise’s graphic programs, which illustrate
chemical principles, won in the minicomputer and
above and microcomputer categories. One of his
graphics will be used as an illustration on the
cover of the publication, ‘‘Computers in Chemical
Education,” later this year.

Earlier this summer, Dr. Wise was one of 290
participants throughout the world at the Ninth In-
ternational Conference of Atomic Physics at the
University of Washington in Seattle.

Former dean dies

Dr. Leon F. Sensabaugh, a former Washington
and Lee dean and history professor, died July 26 in
Lexington following a lengthy illness. He was 80.

Dr. Sensabaugh came to Washington and Lee in
1956 as dean of the University. He held that posi-
tion until 1960, when he became a full-time history
professor. He taught history until retiring in 1974,
when he was designated a dean emeritus by the
W&L Board of Trustees.

A native of Dublin, Texas, Dr. Sensabaugh
received a bachelor’s degree in history from
Vanderbilt University in 1925. He received his
Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1928.

Before coming to W&L, Dr. Sensabaugh had

taught at Oklahoma City University for 13 years
and at Birmingham-Southern College for 20 years.
At Birmingham-Southern, he was chairman of the
department of history and political science and
chairman of the division of social sciences.

Dr. Sensabaugh’s field of special interest was
Latin American history, especially Brazilian
history. He spent a year in Brazil studying United
States-Brazilian relations on a_ Rosenfeld
Fellowship.

After retiring from W&L, Dr. Sensabaugh serv-
ed on Lexington City Council and as president of
the Rockbridge County Cancer Society.

Dr. Ennis dies

Dr. Thomas E. Ennis Jr., a professor of account-
ing at Washington and Lee, died in an apparent
suicide July 29.

Dr. Ennis, who was 54, died from carbon monox-
ide poisoning from a car, according to the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff’s Department.

A native of Salisbury, N.C., Dr. Ennis had been
a member of the W&L faculty since 1955.

He received his bachelor of science degree in
1952 and his master’s degree in business ad-
ministration in 1955, both from the University of
North Carolina. He earned his Ph.D. from the
University of Michigan in 1964.

He also served in the Army from 1952 to 1954.

Dr. Ennis, who studied the effects of inflation on
accounting, was a member of the National
Association of Accountants, the American Ac-
counting Association, Phi Beta Kappa and Beta
Gamma Sigma, the business administration honor

fraternity.

W&L receives

bequest from
Parmly estate

Washington and Lee has received a $1.3 million
bequest from the estate of the late Ruth Parmly of
New York City.

Miss Parmly, who died May 8 at the age of 80,
was one of the University’s most generous
benefactors. She had previously given W&L gifts
totaling $2 million to maintain its program in the
sciences, with special emphasis on physics,
physics-engineering and mathematics.

Although she did not have any direct tie with
W&L, Miss Parmly had been aware of a gift made
to the University in the early 1900s by Robert
Parker Doremus, a New York stockbroker.
Visiting the W&L campus for the first and only
time shortly before his death in 1913, Doremus was
so impressed that he bequeathed his entire estate
to the University.

Miss Parmly said that, the story of the Doremus
gift had provided her with ‘‘an indirect connec-
tion’? with W&L. The building that houses the
biology, physics and physics-engineering depart-
ments is named after her father, Charles Howard
Parmly, a professor at City College of New York.

The W&L Board of Trustees will consider a per-
manent use for Miss Parmly’s bequest at its Oc-
tober meeting.

Orientation said ‘hectic’ tor freshman class

 

By COTTON PURYEAR
Staff Reporter

 

Having freed itself from the
burdens of home, the Class of
1988 now faces the challenge of
its first days at college.

For some freshmen this week,
the challenge began with getting
used to living in a small town
such as Lexington. ‘‘It’s unusual
to live in such a small place, but
it’s a really pretty town,” said
Ty McMains of Baton Rouge, La.

Although McMains had been to
Lexington twice before he mov-
ed in Sunday, some of the fresh-
men were seeing the town for the
first time. Rusty Weiss of Cincin-
nati said he enjoyed being in
Lexington. ‘‘I love it. I was also
surprised that such a small town
_ would pretty much have
everything that you need,” he
said.

The Lexington area didn’t pro-
vide Rob Ryan with everything
he needed. When Ryan arrived
from Southern California at the
Roanoke airport at 7 p.m. last
Friday, he discovered that the
next bus to Lexington wasn’t.
leaving until 3 a.m. “‘I felt like a
total fool,’’ he said. ‘‘I ended up
paying a taxi driver $60 to bring
me to Lexington.”’

After settling in Sunday, the

freshmen were greeted on Mon-

day with placement tests and
orientation meetings. ‘‘It’s been
really hectic,’’ said McMains,
‘but everyone’s been really
friendly and it’s been easy to
meet people.”’

Although Ryan said some of
the meetings lasted a little long,
he said he felt the University
was doing the best possible job of
clearing up all the freshmen’s
questions.

“There still is some confusion,
but it is more of a general confu-
sion of being away from home
and getting used to new sur-
roundings,”’ he said.

Senior dorm counselor Joe
Morelos said everything is run-
ning smoothly. ‘‘Most of the
questions they have are about
curriculum and Rush,”’ he said,
‘‘and there has been more talk
about the chances of the drink-
ing age being raised than about
coeducation.”’

Ryan also said not many fresh-
men were talking about their
class being W&L’s last all-male
class. ‘‘Maybe this spring it will
hit us,” he added.

Ryan said he felt it was too bad
the all-male tradition at W&L
will end because ‘‘there just
aren’t many traditions left to-
day.”

Hunter Applewhite of Rich-
mond said that W&L’s all-male
tradition was attractive but add-

WGL welcomes 1, 715

Orientation for approximately
380 entering Washington and Lee
freshmen began Monday and
classes for all students start next
Monday, Sept. 10.

University officials anticipate
a total enrollment of about 1,350
students in W&L’s undergradu-
ate divisions for the 1984-85
academic year. That does not in-
clude the W&L School of Law,
which has an enrollment of 365.
Classes for law students began
August 22.

   

The entering freshmen were
selected from a pool of 1,502 ap-
plicants for admission. The new
students are from 38 states and
six foreign countries and repre-
sent 281 secondary schools.

Geographically, the largest
contingent of freshmen (82)
comes from the Commonwealth
of Virginia. Maryland is second
with 36 freshmen followed by
Georgia (26), New Jersey (23),
Pennsylvania (20) and New
York (19).

coeducation sounds. Besides, I
figure that the Board of Trustees
knows what’s better for the
university than I do.”’

Morelas said it is too early to
tell how this freshman class is
shaping up.

“T have seen more computers
and some really big T.V. sets.”
He added that he saw one fresh-
man bringing in a pair of six-foot
tall speakers. ‘‘Fortunately,’’ he
said, “he wasn’t on my hall.”’

McDonald’s arrives in Lexington

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

It may be a good time for the
great taste of McDonald’s, but
Lexington’s other fast food
restaurants are still reporting
increased sales since the Golden
Arches’ opening here Aug. 17.

The local fast food connoisseur
can expect some changes in
menu and service from these
eateries, though, including beer
on tap at Arby’s and home
delivery from Pizza Hut.

McDonald’s manager Kathy
McCarty said, ‘‘It (business) has
been great, super.’’ About half of
its business is coming from
Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute students,
while the other half is coming
from people passing Lexington
on Interstate 81, Ms. McCarty
said.

Both Wendy’s and Pizza Hut,
which are near McDonald’s on
East Nelson Street, have seen
sales increase since the middle
of August.

‘‘We don’t have a sign on the
highway,’ said Pizza Hut
manager Jerry Limerick. Both
Limerick and Wendy’s manager
Jeff Lilly said they feel that
motorists getting off the In-
terstate see the McDonald’s
sign, but find they have a choice
once they are on Nelson Street.
Due to state regulations that in-
clude being open for breakfast
by 7 a.m., neither Pizza Hut nor
Wendy’s qualifies to advertise
on the interstate.

Lloyd’s of Lexington and Ar-
by’s, although not reporting in-
creased sales, are not reporting
any decreases either. These two
restaurants, along with Wendy’s
and Pizza Hut, have already
made some changes or will be
making some in the near future.
Arby’s nationwide is_ incor-
porating a hamburger and a
baked potato, similar to Wen-
dy’s, into the menu. The local
Arby’s also has applied for a
beer license and should be serv-
ing beer soon, according to assis-
tant manager Carolyn Emma.

Lloyd’s, sporting new video
games and a “Watch Out
McDonald’s”’ sign, has cut ham-
burger prices from 80 cents to 59
cents. Pizza Hut will be offering
a delivery service starting Sept.
10. ‘‘It will eventually be incor-
porated on a national level. We

have to keep up with the com-
petition,” said Limerick, who
noted the rise of pizza delivery
services such as Domino’s. Piz-
za Hut’s hours are being extend-
ed to 2 a.m. in conjunction with
the delivery service.

Wendy’s, which is reporting
increased sales both locally and
nationwide because of it’s recent
“‘Where’s the Beef?’’ blitz, is
developing a breakfast menu.
‘“‘We had plans to start breakfast
way before McDonald’s came
in,”’ Lilly said.

So whatever the effect of the
new McDonald’s is, and
wherever the beef is, Lexington
has developed into more than a
one-burger town. Students in-
terested in part-time work at
any of these restaurants should
see the managers for applica-
tions.

There are 42 Virginians in the
first-year law class. Although
Virginia normally has_ the
highest representation of
students in the Law School’s stu-
dent body, the number in the

entering class is unusually
large.
The highest representation

from a single undergraduate in-
stitution is the University of
Virginia with 17 graduates
represented in the W&L first-
year class.

Next comes Washington and
Lee with 10 followed by Virginia
Tech with five, the University of
Alabama and Duke with four
each, and Smith and Vanderbilt
with three each.

Included among the first-year
students are a commercial
fisherman who also is the co-
founder of an environmental
organization; a Ph.D. who
taught all grades in a one-room
schoolhouse before teaching col-
lege English; a horticulturalist,
a social worker who specialized
in the prevention of child abuse;
and an administrator for a South
Texas organization that
distributes food to the needy.

Surface, whom Fallon saw as an
important team leader in the
summer workouts, and senior
slotback and tri-captain Tom
Wiser, whom Fallon calls ‘‘a fine
performer and a double threat
that the defense cannot ignore.”’

With senior tri-captain Pat
O’Connell as the only returning
Starter from last year’s All-
Conference offensive line,
Fallon set out to rebuild his of-
fensive line and is now quite
pleased with the result.

“We played a lot of people last
year, so quite a few players have
experience and have shown they
can handle the jobs in the line.
The players that have surfaced
to starting positions this year
were good performers last year.

“We may have lost a little in
size from last year’s line, but I
think we may be a little bit
quicker up front this year than
we have been in the past,’’ he
said.

Balancing out the line with
O’Connell at one tackle, Fallon
sees senior Paul Marasciullo at
the other tackle, senior Craig
Waddell and junior John San-
ders at the guards and senior
Harry Golliday to fill the shoes
of departing All-American Glenn
Kirschner at center.

Junior Chris Bleggi has been
moved from tailback to split end
and is slated to share duties with
classmate Hugh Finkelstein,
who returns after sitting out 1983
with a shoulder injury. At tight
end, seniors Ian Banwell and
Dave Sizemore will handle the
details.

Despite losing six starters,
Fallon remains confident in his
defense. ‘‘Up front, we’re going
to be quite similar to what we
were last year,” he said, in-
dicating returners Jim Lyall
(nose guard), Mark Weaver
(tackle) and Craig Westbrook
(end) will be joined by a pair of
‘‘hard-working’’ juniors in
tackle Alex Castelli and end Tim
Richardson.

Fallon said the real question in

the defense was at the line-
backer position where both of
last year’s starters, John Cole
and Bill Foster, were lost to
graduation. Filling those slots,
however is a group led by senior
Kurt Specht and sophomore Bob
Berlin.

“I have confidence in these
two. They’re both rea! good per-
formers,”’ Fallon said.

The Generals return three of
four starters to the defensive
backfield with hard-hitting cor-
nerback Kelvin Newsome and
strong safety Tim Janyska
leading the way from 1983.

Joining Janyska and New-
some will be junior Chris Wilson,
who filled in at free safety last

year when Bob Jenevein went
down with an injury, and junior
Scott Henderson at cornerback.
Fallon said he is pleased with his
team’s depth. in this area and in-
dicated that as situations dictate
he would use a fifth defensive
back.

The Generals will return the
same pair from last year for
kicking duties. James White,
who holds the W&L record for
most points-after-touchdown in a
single season, will handle the
placement detail, while Gene
Girard will continue as punter.

Saturday’s contest will be the
third meeting between Dickin-
son arid W&L. The Generals lead
the series 2-0, but Fallon is call-

ing this meeting a ‘‘mystery
game.”

“We're going into this game
almost blind as far as knowing
what to prepare for, as well as
what to prepare against,’’ he
said.

The Red Devils finished 1983 ai
2-7 and are under the tutelage of
interim head coach Wilbur
Gobrecht. Team leaders for the
Pennsylvania school include
two-year starter at quarterback
Stan Abromavage, three-year
starting tailback John Parker
and fullback John Grant.

“Our offense is geared more to
the run,’’ Gobrecht said. ‘‘Ideal-
ly, a good play mix would be two-
thirds' running and one-third
passing, but we'll vary that
some, depending on our situa-

tion, probably up to 50-50.”

“Our weakness could be lack
of overall depth, along with the
fact that we are a young team,”
he said, but proclaimed that
“our program is on the upsw-
ing.”

“It would be awfully nice if I
could say, ‘We’ve got them in
our pocket,’ but, doggone, we
don’t,’’ he said.

Fallon said Dickinson’s 2-7
record is a bit deceptive. ‘‘They
play in a tough league (the

Centennial Conference). I ex-
pect a very tough football
| game.”

Game time on Saturday is 1:30
p.m. at Wilson Field. W&L has
invited the students of Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College as
honored guests for the day.

Remillard plays key role in Olympic effort

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

When the accolades were be-
ing passed out to those victorious
at the Olympic Games in Los
Angeles this summer, Page
Remillard was not exactly
swamped with praise.

Yet, Remillard, who is enter-
ing his sixth season as swim-
ming and water polo coach at
Washington and Lee, played a
vital role in the silver-medal suc-
cess of the U.S. water polo team.

Remillard was the chairman
of the video committee for the
U.S. team. He was in charge of
scouting the American opposi-
tion in Los Angeles. As every
coach knows, a_ thorough
scouting report is crucial to a
team’s success.

Remillard, working with his
assistants on the committee
Gary Troyer and Jim Sprague,
compiled approximately 60
hours of film of various foreign
teams in action during the past
year and a half. The three men
worked for over 300 hours view-
ing and editing the films and
determining the tendencies,

strengths and weaknesses of the
foreign teams. The editing work
was done with equipment from
W&L.

The films were presented to
U.S. head coach Monty Nitzkow-.
ski on March 5. Remillard said
Nitzkowski was well pleased
with the work done by the com-
mittee.

Remillard was in Los Angeles
for the Games, where the U.S.
was undefeated in competition,
tying only eventual gold-medal
winner Yugoslavia. Perhaps, the
quality of the scouting work done
by Remillard and his staff was
shown by the fact that Yugoslav-
ia was the only team competing
in the Olympics that the video
committee was unable to film in
action prior to the Games.

“You can always look back
and say ‘if, if, if...,”’ Remillard
said. Remillard believes that his
Olympic experience will benefit
the water polo program at W&L.
The W&L players will gain
valuable knowledge from the
films made by the video commit-
tee. Remillard added that the ex-
perience and ‘‘inside stories” he
acquired by working with the

  

ALOHA WOK

409 South Main St., Lexington, Virginia 24450

 

U.S. team have “helped to
motivate the W&L water polo
players.”

Remillard views his Olympic
experience as a good one, but
said that he is “kind of burned
out’? due to his strenuous
schedule during the last four
years. He also stated that ‘‘if it
wasn’t for the W&L administra-
tion encouraging this type of per-
sonal exposure, I never would’ve
been involved with the Olympic

team.”’

Remillard plans to reduce the
number of commitments he
makes outside his position at
W&L in the future in order to
“get to know his community.”
He was away from Lexington
nearly 100 days this summer and
traveled approximately 10,000
miles. Remillard said that he
now realizes that ‘‘there is more
to life than water polo and
W&L.”

An objective view of Los Angeles

...Thank you, and it’s a
pleasure to be back in this cor-
ner offering my distorted and
disputed view of the world of
sports.

....Looking back over the sum-
mer, I have to make my first
stop at Los Angeles. Frankly,
I'm rather bored with the talk of
the Dan Rather and David
Brinkley types who have sudden-
ly rediscovered American
patriotism. These were the same
people who reminded us con-
stantly how athletics and sports
should not be mixed when those-
not-seeing-the light decided to
boycott the festivities in
southern California. Let’s look at
these games (remember, chil-
dren play games) in somewhat
of a more objective frame. Sport
is sport and should be enjoyed
for the simplicity of the concept
of competition. The L.A. Games
provided its viewers with many
of those positive moments.
Perhaps, they were positive
because many of those moments

centered around our own
athletes. But I think a fan should
appreciate the performance of
an athlete regardless of where
he comes from. I think it matters
not that four-medal swimmer
Michael Gross is West German,
the winner of the marathon is:
Portugese or that the winners of
water polo had a different ar-
rangement of red, white and
blue for their flag. Let us
remember and enjoy the effort
it takes to be a_ winner.
The appreciation of athletic
competition goes beyond win-
ning, though. For me, _ the

the highlight of the Games. It
was probably a moment of un-
fulfilled dreams but also and
most importantly it was a mo-
ment of raw emotion, feelings
that are at the core of sports.
Keeping all of this in mind, it
seems rather boring to mention
that the Communist-bloc nations
were not in the right place at the
right time. Were they missed?
Only in that we had no one to
cheer against, an unhealthy at-
titude indeed and one that has no
place in something as pure as
the Olympic Games. One need
only to look to the Games’ open-
ing ceremonies to realize that
boycotts and the like are a
mistake. Athletes, when they so
chose, have a special way of ris-
ing above the nonsense of this
trivial world in which we live.
Yes, it is a positive feeling we
can take from those last two
weeks in July. Funny, and our
Games did not need a silly and
superficial title to lend them
credence...

....F or our inaugural trip down
the Colonnade, we’ll look at the
General gridders. Frankly,
there’s a tall order to fill with the
departure of four of five offen-
sive frontliners. If that area is
reasonably replaced, a feat that
seems quite possible, W&L is
Staring. at winning season.
number five...A quick guess for
Saturday’s tilt at Wilson Field
against Dickinson: W&L in im-
pressive fashion over a team
that doesn’t have the horses to
play with the Generals...

i And while we’re on the Col-
onnade, here are a pair of an-
nouncements for you the W&L

fan. The new McDonald’s is
sponsoring a W&L-VMI contest
of sorts. The restaurant has
taken out ads in both the W&L
and VMI football programs for
the upcoming season. The school
that returns the most ads to
McDonalds by season’s end will
receive a $500 gift. If W&L men
return the most ads, the $500 will
go toward the University’s Big
Brother program. I don’t know
about you, but I’d consider it a
terrible misfortune if a VMI
gentleman had any reason to
think he was better than a W&L
gentleman. Let’s do our part to
remove any doubt in anyone’s
mind and at the same time give
the Big Brother program a
deserved helping hand...Another
item for the football fan is the in-
augural Woman’s College Day to
begin with Saturday’s game. Ac-
cording to W&L Sports Informa-
tion Director Mark Mandel,
every General home football
game will be devoted to one of
the surrounding schools for. the
fairer sex. This weekend, young
women from Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College will be bused
to Wilson Field for an afternoon
of football Generals’ style and an
evening of entertainment at
their choice. Indeed, an idea
whose benefits are limitless.
Needless to say, gentlemen, I
would recommend you get your
seats early on Saturday....

Finally, a thought on
basebrawls. There have been
two of note: The Padres-Braves
game a few weeks back and last
Sunday’s 15-minute bout be-
tween the Angels and _ the
Yankees. Getting away from
whether it is a horrendous act or
not — it is — I think what is most
disturbing is its reflection on the
professional athlete. These sorts
of brawls have no place in the
game, and what’s more, I do not
think they reflect any sort of
team-looking-after-its-own idea.
Rather, it is the childish reaction
of an over-priced child playing a
game who doesn’t have things go
his way. Somewhere the line has
to be drawn on what is accept-
able behavior for a_ baseball
player (pitchers notably includ-
ed) and what is not. Forget fines
and suspensions. Arrest the
perpetrators on assault and
disorderly conduct charges. The
professional athlete has become
a prima donna simply because
he has been allowed to evolve as
such. I remember when I had

athletes as role models...but just

barely...

...Would be nice if Martina
Navratilova were to lose. Won’t
happen this weekend, though...1
wonder if Tom Landry can pro-
nounce ‘“‘Hogeboom’’ yet. No
doubt Danny White keeps
repeating it in his sleep....

Summer vacation ends early for WGL athletes

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

Studying plays, watching
films, running circuits, swim-
ming sprints and running up
mountains, some Washington
and Lee students arrive at
school one-and-a-half to three
weeks before classes begin to
train and practice for fall varsi-
ty sports.

While many Wé&L students
recuperate from their summer
jobs and prepare for the begin-
ning of the academic year dur-
ing the final weeks of summer
break, cross country, football,
soccer and water polo team
members reported to Lexington
to attend pre-season practice
sessions in temperatures
greater than 90 degrees.

Football players returned first
on Aug. 18. Water polo players
arrived next with their practice
beginning Aug. 24. Soccer
players returned at two different
times: upperclassmen on Aug.
30 and freshmen the following
day. Some members of the cross
country team returned to Lex-
ington to train before the team’s
first organized practice on Sept.
1.

The football and water polo
teams have practice routines
that require more than eight
hours of an athlete’s time each
day. Pre-season water polo prac-
tice ends with a four-mile run up
a mountain. Soccer and cross
country also carry a busy sche-
dule with practices twice a day.

In team sports such as foot-
ball, soccer and water polo,
coaches usually require an
athlete’s participation in the pre-
season program if that athlete
wants to compete in the fall, ac-
cording to W&L coaches. These
sports require teamwork, best
obtained by practicing together.
Coaches and players utilize the
two- to three-week period before
classes begin trying to guaran-
tee the success of their pro-
grams.

In cross country, however, in-
dividuals can train on their own
and therefore do not need to
return as early as other athletes.
According to cross country
coach Dick Miller, W&L runners
have summer physical training
programs that require running a
maximum of 50 miles a week.
After returning to school, cross
country runners begin increas-
ing their pace and improving
their times so that their perfor-
mances peak at the end of the
season, when it counts the most.

Football coach Gary Fallon
said he believes upperclassmen
approach his three-week prac-
tice session with a positive at-
titude, but notes that some
freshmen have difficulties dur-
ing the course of the practices.
Freshmen usually have not en-
countered a physical training
program that requires so much
of their strength and energy, he
said.

Freshman Simon Perez of
Harrisonburg admits that water
polo practice drains him
physically. But Perez, who plays
water polo to enhance his
primary athletic ambition with
the swim team, said he has ‘‘no
problems’’ adjusting to W&L
despite the rigorous practice
schedule. Water polo practices
are from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. and
freshman orientation has been
keeping Perez busy this week,
but he said he believes his par-
ticipation in the water polo pro-
gram produces several benefits.
Not only does Perez enjoy learn-
ing to play water polo, but his
association with other players on
the team provided him with
many friends long before most
freshmen arrived in Lexington.
He said having such a group of
friends is important, especially
now. “It is invaluable having
friends at school before you
start. They help you adjust much
better.”’

The only drawback Perez said
he could associate with his par-
ticipation as a freshman in the

water polo program relates to
fraternity Rush. Water polo
practice times prevented Perez
from attending four open house
dates; however, he said this
drawback is a minor one.

Washington and Lee does not
provide athletic scholarships.
The university does not even
grant financial aid based on
athletic ability to athletes who
participate in programs at the
NCAA Division I level. W&L
athletes have no obligation to the
University to compete, much
less return to school early to face
extensive physical training and
day-long practices in summer
heat.

Why do W&L athletes (not only
those who return early to school
but also those who participate in
programs during the year) sac-
rifice so much of their time and
limit their social life to par-
ticipate in NCAA Division III
athletic programs?

“If I didn’t love it, then I
wouldn’t do it,”’ said junior foot-
ball place kicker James White.

 

 

“I play because I love the game,

and if you want to do something

then you go all the way.”’ Cotton Puryear/The Ring- tum Phi
Not only does he enjoy playing The Generals continue their daily grind of practice this week in

football, White also said he
values the discipline Fallon in-
stills in his players. White said
he strongly believes that this
discipline helps him on and off
the football field.

He said he does not mind being
exhausted from practice or sub-
jected to a curfew during Rush
because he finds football and the
values associated with it worth-
while.

White concluded, “‘If you find
something worthwhile, then you
have to be willing to make
sacrifices for it.”’
