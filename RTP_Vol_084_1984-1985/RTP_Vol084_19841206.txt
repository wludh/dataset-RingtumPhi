WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

SAB warned by ABC
about beer in pavilion

 

By BRUCE POTTER
Chief Editor

 

During a 45-minute meeting this
morning with an Alcoholic Beverage
Control Board agent, the Student Ac-
tivities Board learned that it will
have to develop improved security
and supervisory procedures in order
to continue selling beer at the student
activities pavilion.

“They want us to come up with
some procedures to better handle

security at the pavilion,’ SAB
Entertainment Director John
Haywood said after the meeting.

Despite earlier fears to the con-
trary, he said, ‘‘There’s not going to
be any problem coming up with ban-
quet licenses (to sell beer) as long as
we come up with acceptable proce-
dures.”’

New procedures may include hir-
ing professional security personnel
and bartenders and better training
SAB members who work at pavilion
parties, Haywood added.

ABC agents at Friday night’s
pavilion party were ‘‘unhappy with
the situation in the pavilion,”
said Associate Dean of Students
Michael Cappeto.

Although the party was open only
to Washington and Lee students and
invited guests, ABC agents who did
not identify themselves as college
students were sold tickets, according
to Haywood. The agents also were
concerned with the number of intoxi-
cated people at the party and the

number of bottles students had
brought into the pavilion, Haywood
and Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said.

They were definitely upset with
what they saw out there Friday
night,”’ John said. ‘‘The ABC people
have a real concern about violations
of ABC regulations there.”’

Either two or three agents were at
the party, Cappeto said.

About 12:15 a.m., two agents spoke
with Haywood, SAB Chairman Bur-
ford Smith and Bobby Pifer, who had
obtained the banquet license for the
party.

“They were concerned...that there
were a lot of intoxicated individuals,
some of whom were continuing to be
served beer,’’ Haywood
said. ‘‘The agents obviously were not
happy at all. They were very con-
cerned about the situation.”

On Monday, one of the agents tele-
phoned Dean John to explain the pro-
blems.

“He said that as a result of what he
saw Friday night, he was not of a
mind to recommend or approve any
further licenses for out there,” John
said.

During that telephone conversa-
tion, which John said was brief, this
morning’s meeting was arranged
among the ABC officials and John,
Cappeto, Student Body President
Cole Dawson, Smith and Haywood.

Haywood emphasized that this
morning’s meeting was not intended
to be an appeal of a decision that had
already been made. ‘‘We’re not clear

Change of venue

asked by

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

A request to change the location of
the trial of Scot Tanner Mesner, the
19-year-old accused of setting last
spring’s fatal Washington and Lee
fraternity house fire, was filed by his
attorney yesterday in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court.

The change of venue request was
one of three motions relating to the
Mesner case submitted to Circuit
Court Judge George E. Honts III yes-
terday. The documents were made
available late this morning.

The trial is scheduled to be held at
the Rockbridge County Courthouse
on Dec. 19 through 21.

Mesner was indicted Sept. 4 for ar-
son and murder in connection with
the Phi Gamma Delta fire. Each of
the two charges carries a potential
penalty of between 20 years and life
in prison.

In the change of venue motion,
Mesner’s lawyers said that media co-
verage of the case ‘‘has been of such
a highly inflammatory and prejudici-
al nature’ that the trial should be
moved to another region ‘‘in order to
preserve the defendant’s constitu-
tional right to a fair trial by an im-
partial jury.”’

Rockbridge Circuit Court Clerk D.
Bruce Patterson said about 35 jurors
will be summoned for the trial.

Patterson said that in past cases
when a change of venue motion has
been filed, a hearing has not been
held prior to the scheduled opening of
the trial.

If you’re way behind in prepar-
ing for exams and you've got a 10-
page paper due tomorrow morn-
ing, what do you do?

Common solutions might be
either to pull an all-nighter or just
to give up, get a good night’s sleep
and take your chances with the
Automatic Rule committee.

Professors and students inter-
viewed this week had some even
more original ideas.

Psychology Professor David G.
Elmes recommends three possi-
ble solutions. Prayer is first, and
asking the dean for forgiveness is
next.

“Or,’’ he added, ‘‘you could pos-
sibly give mea BMW.”

 

Just play ‘Alpine Ski’

Mesner

“They wait until the day of the
trial, and if they’re successful in im-
paneling a jury, then of course they’ll
deny the motion,” he said. ‘If they
can’t impanel a jury, then they hold a
hearing. But that’s all entirely up to
the judge.”’

The Code of Virginia says a circuit
court judge may grant a prosecution
or defense motion for change of ve-
nue “‘for good cause.”

A second motion also cited ‘‘exten-
sive regional media coverage’’ in its
request that prospective jurors be
questioned out of the presence of
other potential jurors. The motion for
individual voir dire states that due to
the publicity in the case, effective
questioning ‘‘simply cannot be
conducted in a group interrogation
without irreparable prejudice.”

A third motion dated yesterday ob-
jects to two of the three types of hair
that Commonwealth’s Attorney Bev-
erly C. ‘‘John’’ Read had requested
that law enforcement officials be
allowed to obtain from Mesner. The
motion did not object to the request
for samples of head hair.

Mesner’s motion states that ‘‘the
Commonwealth should be required to
show that the purpose of this request
is relevant to the issues presented by
the present case...and that the possi-
ble results of such requests will not
be prejudicially speculative in re-
gard to this defendant.”’

Read declined to comment on the
motion.

A report by the state Bureau of
Forensic Science dated Nov. 7 in

Senior Bob Spatig, a dorm coun-
selor, has another idea.

‘When in doubt, play Alpine Ski
at Lloyd’s,”’ he suggested.

On a serious side, though, those
interviewed agreed that the best
solution is to avoid procrastina-
tion in the first place.

In fact, all dorm counselors this
week received a set of guidelines
concerning the upcoming exami-
nation period, and one of the ma-
jor notes warns about procrasti-
nation.

“If you haven’t studied by now,
it’s probably too late,’ said
Elmes, who last year conducted a
study of students on the correla-
tion between mood and studying
efficiency.

whether they’ve taken beer out of the
pavilion or not,”’ he said earlier this
week,

The type of license the SAB obtains
for pavilion parties is known as a
banquet license. This license allows
for the one-day purchase, sale and
consumption of beer by a private or-
ganization, and must be obtained on
a per-event basis. ‘“‘The law assumes
that you are holding essentially a
closed party,’’ Haywood said.

Although only students and their
properly invited guests are supposed
to be admitted to events held with a
banquet license, University adminis-
trators noted that the ABC usually
regards women from the surround-
ing colleges as invited guests.

“T think it would be unfair to say
that the ABC has not been coopera-
tive. They have been,”’ Haywood add-
ed.

A problem arises, though, he said,
in that juniors and seniors at W&L
are not required to have college iden-
tification cards, and thus the SAB
cannot limit admission only to those
students with ID cards.

“It is almost impossible to require
college IDs because our people don’t
carry college IDs,’’ Haywood said.
“In the future, IDs are going to have
to be mandatory.”’

Even the freshmen and sopho-
mores, who are supposed to have

Brower in the buff?

 

 

No, sorry to disappoint you all. Darby’s wearing a
polo shirt and jeans.

Nevertheless, watch out, Tom Selleck: Here come
two different groups of calendar ‘‘pin-up’’ men from
Washington and Lee. Although neither calendar allows
its men to bare it all, both do show W&L student-mo-
dels in and about Lexington.

Darby Brower and Marquis Smith — Mr. February
and Mr. October, respectively — were production coor-
dinators for a calendar sponsored by Coors’ beer that
has a black-and-white picture of a different W&L fra-
ternity man for each month of 1985.

Tina Harrison, who produced the other calendar,
“Some Men of Lexington, Virginia,’ went for a much
wider cross-section of W&L that includes independents
and law students.

“Normally the guys who are in it have to pay to get
this kind of exposure,’ Brower said of the Coors calen-
dar. ‘‘As far as why we did it, it’s just an experiment in
private enterprise.”’

While Brower and Smith received a $2,300 loan from
Coors, Tina Harrison, a self-employed graphic-design
artist, put up $2,000 of her own for her calendar.

“T just graduated from Mary Washington College,
and this calendar is an addition to my portfolio,”
Harrison explained. ‘I’ve grown up in Lexington, and
some professors’ wives and some admissions people
gave me the students’ names.”’

Harrison emphasized that she was not after the typi-
cal “face man”’ calendar. ‘‘It seems to be a real good
cross-section, and that’s what I wanted.”’

Brower said there is not enough room in this town for
two calendars, and that their approach is better,

“T don’t feel like there is enough market for each,”’
he said. ‘‘Theirs is more expensive than ours, and may-
be in the long run ours is a little better.”’

Two Mink calendars published

He went on to say that the comments about Lex-
ington in Harrison’ calendar are overdoing it a bit.

The Coors calendar is priced at five dollars, and Har-
ae ’s costs $7.50. Both are available at the W&L Book-
store.

Student-models from both calendars said they have
been getting teased around campus,

“They start to talk about it, I start to frown and then
they stop,” said David Woodham, Coors’ Mr. April. -

Henry Dewing, the August model in Harrison’s cal-
endar, said he did not do it just for the two free calen-
dars he received.

“I did it for the hell of it,’’ Dewing said. ‘‘The reac-
tion has been a combination of, ‘It’s a nice picture,’ to,
‘Hey, what are you doing ina calendar?’ “

Bob Tomaso said he was a little skeptical before he
agreed to pose for September in Harrison’s calendar.

“I thought it would be a little exciting, I guess,” To-
maso said. ‘‘They (the Coors calendar) certainly have
more face men. Ours is obviously a calendar of people
who haveaccomplished something at school.”

Tomaso declined to say which calendar was better,
though.

Mike McAlevey said he has gotten lots of ‘infamous
notoriety” for his January pose in the Coors calendar.

‘I did it because I thought it would be interesting and
because it was flattering.’’ McAlevey said. ‘‘Outside of
the grief I've gotten from my friends, I haven't gotten
much out of it materially except my one free copy.”’

He added that he thought Brower and Smith have
priced the calendar too high, and that it should have in-
cluded a wider cross-section of students.

Mark Pembroke, Mr. February in Harrison’s calen-
dar, also has experienced a mixed reaction on campus.

‘ did it as a favor and was a bit flattered, too. The
reactions have mostly been kind of funny: ‘There he is:
Mr. Calendar Boy, Mr. February,’ It has all been in
jest.”

With coeducation coming up, maybe someone will do
a spread of ‘‘Women at W&L.”’

Discouraging

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting, Vice
President James White released the findings of his informal
poll of the Law School. While the poll contains no real sur-
prises, the statistical breakdown of the results is at once alar-
ming and discouraging.

Discounting temporarily the dismal 30 percent response
rate, the responses on the three sections of the poll reveal a
great deal about the opinions of the Honor System in Lewis
Hall. Over half of the students responding thought the Honor

_ System worked only ‘‘ok”’ (versus ‘‘great’’), but by about the

same margin, the same students believed the system was not
“*too legalistic.’

That is distressing, for it signals that something is foul in
the state of affairs. Do law students believe that the Honor

- System should be more legalistic, or does the code fail long

before it even approaches legalism? Similarly, do law stu-
dents really believe the Honor System should continue to be
the rule in their classrooms?

Equally interesting were the results to the questions as to
Law School representation on the EC. Of those polled, 62 per-
cent believed they did not receive adequate representation
with only two at-large law members on the EC, while 83 per-
cent thought an additional law representative would be in
order. Emphasizing the need for additional communication
between the EC and the Law School was the response indicat-
ing that 54 percent of those polled were not aware of the most
recent White Book revisions.

Law School involvement with undergraduates, according
to the poll, is minimal, except for large University-wide func-
tions such as Fancy Dress and pavilion parties. That is
understandable, for law students generally are not interested
in participating in activities led by undergraduates or cater-
ing solely to undergraduates.

All this points to several important initiatives that must be
made. First, the poll to be taken with the ‘‘Big Three” elec-
tions in March asking whether or not students on the whole
believe an additional law representative should be elected
must be emphasized as a means for bringing the Law School
closer to both the Honor System and the undergraduate popu-
lation. At stake with a third law representative is not merely
a question of equal representation but one of making the
Honor System a reality and a force in the Law School. Addi-
tionally, the EC in general and the law representatives on the
EC in particular should undertake a greater effort to commu-
nicate the issues before the EC with law students, especially
those issues dealing with the White Book. While additional
communication will not necessarily ‘‘unite’’ the two schools,
it certainly will quell the common perception that ignorance
of the Honor System is acceptable or allowed.

White’s poll, though wrapped in controversy, is certainly
an important step toward building (and not ‘‘mending”’) rela-
tions between the Law School and the undergraduates. The
challenge before both groups is to take action according to its
results. Only in recognizing the problem, confronting the is-
sues and working together toward solutions will the state of
affairs return to any semblance of normality.

Finest hour

For seven days beginning Saturday at 2 p.m., Washington
and Lee will enjoy its finest hours. Students will be studying,
faculty will be correcting, and coffee sales will soar. The
campus will be quiet, except for the groans heard when the
bell tolls noon or 5 p.m.

But besides the subtle changes in appearance, the Univer-
sity’s finest hours come with the onslaught of final examina-
tions, for in those quickly passing hours is the character of
the school put to the test. Washington and Lee has an Honor
System, but not just any honor system.(For example, hand-
ing in someone else’s work here has always been considered
dishonorable.) Our understanding of honor allows us to sche-
dule our final exams, take those exams without a proctor
frantically pacing the room observing the slightest blinking
or nodding, and trusts that those students who have complet-
ed exams will maintain a code of silence until the exam-
ination period has finished. That is a luxury few college
students are afforded in this nation.

So, in these few frantic hours remaining of the fall term, as
you sit studying those notes you took last September in fine
handwriting and a green felt-tip pen, remember that you are
part of an exceptional process, a system that at once refines
character while defining it. At test this week is not merely a
myriad of courses, but a way of life.

On my honor, I have neither given nor received any
unacknowledged aid on this editoral.

Remembrance of Christmases past

OUR VIEW

By Mike McAlevey
and Scott Henderson

 

It’s that time again. Christmas
spirit pervades the chilled December
air and the not-much-warmer hearts
of the people celebrating this joyous
occasion. That’s right, boys, we’re
back on that coaster into the fathom-
less recesses of our own misanthro-
pic, self-centered souls. Oh, so that’s
a little strong — but isn’t it about
time we removed our tinsel-tainted,
rose-colored glasses and took a
closer look at what this once most
sanctified day of the year has been
reduced to?

It’s not hard to see what I mean,
just take a look at prime time televi-
sion (you can be sure your little
brothers and sisters are). Let’s take
a little trip down memory lane to
where this materialistic indoctrina-
tion all began, that time when we,
too, were little kids.

Ah, yes, remember the nature of
toys back then, the simplicity that re-
quired a little imagination. How
about those GI Joes? I remember
when GI Joe was just a little figurine.

By B. Scott

Professor Nancy Margand, proba-
bly without realizing it, has profound-
ly changed my view on school...and
life.

It began four Thursdays ago when I
got a call from Washington. It was a
friend asking me to go to Bermuda
with him and his wife and some other
guys on a retreat the following week.

“Right,” I said. ““You want me to
take a week off from school — the
week before Thanksgiving break —to
take off on some exotic excursion.
Like I’m sosure.”’

“‘Well, you need to be up here the
day after tomorrow if you decide to
go,”’ he said. ‘But we need to know
tomorrow morning.”

This was all too weird for me. It
was like something that your friends
always do, but you never imagine
yourself doing. It was like a movie.
But for a couple of reasons, not really
important here, this time was impor-
tant to me.

I decided to ask for my professors’
advice, knowing that they would

Law students
reassured

To the Editors:

Mr. Leach’s statement that he
would not deny library services to a
VMI cadet any more than he would a
law student is a great relief to all
those who attend classes in Lewis
Hall. For some time we have been
apprehensive as to our status, not-
withstanding the fact that we each
pay the paltry sum of $6,515 in tuition
to the University.

On behalf of all the law students, I
would like to thank Mr. Leach for as-
suring us that he would not deny us
the services of the UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY.

When you wanted him to walk, you
waddled him; to talk, you were the
ventriloquist; to punch, you had to
wrench his whole body into the ac-
tion. And then the metamorphosis be-
gan. Joe got movable limbs, so he
could take one step at a time and use
only one arm to throw a mean jab at
the Viet Cong. But darn if he didn’t
have to move his whole body to spy
on his pinko Commie adversaries.
The obvious renovation was effected.
Joe was given movable eagle
eyes.(Never mind the lever protrud-
ing from the back of his head.) How
was our national hero to fight the
martial arts tactics he faced? Easy.
Give him a kung fu grip. Although his
repertoire of statements was
drastically reduced, it sure lessened
the mental strain on the kids when
Mattel put in a little voicebox so we
could hear him say, 100 times a day,
“T’ll not stand for this aggression, die
you foreigner.’’ Then in an exponen-
tial onslaught, out came the lunar
capsule and moon rover to keep up
with the times. Don’t fret too much,
kids, it probably won’t be long before
you can just buy mechanical kids to
play with the toy for you.

Most toys followed the same meta-
morphic race for technical superiori-
ty and contemporary realism. Take,
for example, the primitive Tonka

answer without placing myself
among those timid souls of Teddy
Roosevelt renown who live in that
gray twilight that knows neither vic-
tory or defeat.

Boy, did they fool me!

I could not reach one professor.
Another was reluctantly tolerant.
Another got excited and wanted to
accompany us. But Professor Mar-
gand amazed me.

“Will missing a week of school af-
fect where you are 10 years from
now?”’ she asked.

After a moment of thought, I re-
sponded, ‘‘no.”’

“Well go for it then. This is what
college is for,” she said.

I was inshock. But what impressed
me the most was that it was nota flip-
pant remark. She sensed how impor-
tant it was to me, and the opportunity
that was there for growth in a non-
academic realm.

And that I think is the key.

Through the University’s Big
Brother-Little Brother program, I
have a little brother out in East Lex-
ington. I was kind of shocked the first
time I talked to this 8-year-old and he
was unfamiliar with W&L and what
went on here. And he really didn’t
care.

I began to see a pew perspective.
The world does not revolve around
me or the Colonnade. But it is easy to

Toy. Remember when it was a scaled.

down, reasonable facsimile of a real
piece of construction equipment?
Sure, you had to push it around your-
self and after innumerable nights in
the rain, maybe a little rust would
begin to accumulate. Well, out of in-
novation, safety features, or more
probably an attempt to appeal to
kids’ desire for what daddy really
has, the basic Tonka Toy idea got ex-
ploited from every angle. I can take
cars that have a set track, on which,
from an elevated origin, they could
move of their own accord, but some
of the later updates got a little out of
hand. Soon cars could be joined by a
battery charger, and zip around the
banked curve track at a velocity that
would make Spot take cover behind
the Lazy-Boy recliner with the built-
in TV control device.

Cox planes buzzed around a vertex
attached to a string, and Vertibirds
with variable height and speed con-
trols could rescue distraught citizens
from a towering inferno of burning
stacked Hot Rod magazines (or used
to decapitate the make-believe vil-
lain who perpetrated the arson).
Thank God remote control was in-
vented so kids didn’t have to be re-
stricted by those unrealistic restrain-
ing cables. Was a little rust and im-
agination all that bad?

Well, back to Christmas. How
about the rendition we get on televi-
sion of the Christmas story itself?
“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer”’
is certainly an effective vector for
the transmission of the Christmas
story. It has all the elements of a
good show, touching our sentimen-
tality with Rudolph’s nasal anomoly,
evoking fear with the ominous pre-
sence of the Abominable Snowman,
and illustrative individualism and
good American  entrepreneurism
when the little toymaker announced,
“‘T don’t want to be an elf, I want to be
a dentist.’’ And yes, the happy en-
ding.

But what makes it happy? Is it San-
ta’s compassionate utilization of Ru-
dolph’s former nemesis, or the relief
that our presents won’t be delayed by
that “foggy Christmas Eve’’?

“The Grinch That Stole Christ-
mas”’ is almost as effective. I must
have missed the part when that phy-
sically repulsive devil ruthlessly
mushing his poor puppy over the
Himalayas stole Christ’s birth from
right under their noses. Stupid me,
and I thought all the people were de-
vastated simply because they
weren’t going to receive their gifts.
Wait a minute, which gift do we cele-
brate on the 25th? I seem to have
forgotten. Haven’t we all?

away from here?

going on here and only here.

As William Blake said, in trying to
make ourselves more than men, we
become less. In becoming muddled in
the finite, we lose all sense of the in-
finite.

Markham Pyle used this space a
year ago to extol the virtues of re-
treating with your six-pack of Coors
to Goshen. I’m not a Coors’ fan, but
he hada point.

There is an abundance of academic
riches out there for us. Professors
are an unending source of know-
ledge. In a meager four years here,
we will be able to grasp but the small-
est piddling of it. The short-run goal
is that we absorb that which will
prepare us for whatever step we take
after leaving the friendly confines of
our red-bricked and white-columned
sanctuary.

But let’s not lose sight of the long-
term goal. Let the piddling of infor-
mation you gather serve as a drop of
water does to a desert wanderer. De-
sire more.

And let that desire enable you to
transcend the formal academic
realm and reach that other bastion of
knowledge that awaits. Seek both.
One does not necessarily come at the
expense of the other.

If that means attending the next
cultural event in Lee Chapel, or tak-
ing an afternoon by yourself at Gos-
hen to get things back into perspec-
tive, do it. It might even mean to quit

worrying about whether you get an ~

A-minus or a B-plus in that class you
are sweating bullets over.

What will you take away from here
that will really affect where you are
10 years from now?

White releases poll results

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
News Editor

 

Sixty-two percent of law students said they are
not fairly represented by the Executive Commit-
tee, according to an informal poll by EC Vice
President James White.

In addition, 83 percent said they favor the con-
stitutional amendment proposal that would add a
second-year law representative to the EC to go
along with the first-year and upperclass
representatives. That proposal will be voted on in
March.

Of the 364 law students, 108, or 29.7 percent,
returned questionnaires

The poll, which White distributed in the Law
School four weeks ago, was initiated and paid for
by White, without the consultation of the rest of
the EC.

“It is in no way an official EC poll,” President
Cole Dawson said Tuesday.

Second-year law student Alice Sacks criticized
White last week for distributing the questionnaire
without the approval of the two Law School repre-
sentatives on the FC Some law students said

some questions were worded poorly and might
result in the survey being biased, Sacks said.

White defended himself by saying that he dis-
tributed the questionnaire to gauge law student
opinion on the numerous issues that have arisen
between the undergraduate and law campuses.

Last year, law students passed a referendum
calling for fiscal autonomy from the EC for the
Law School government, but turned down a simi-
lar referendum about the honor system.

At meetings the EC frequently talks of
strengthening the honor system in the Law School
and lessening the differences between the two
campuses.

According to White's poll, 88 percent of law stu-
dents favor fiscal autonomy for the Student Bar
Association, Eighty-five percent said the honor
system works ‘‘great”’ or ‘‘ok’’ in the Law School,
and nine percent said it doesn’t work at all.

Also, 57 percent said they did not feel they were
an integral part of the whole W&L community,
and 62 percent said there is a problem of campus
unity.

Sacks said last week the questions about fiscal
autonomy for the SBA were seen by some stu-
dents as an attempt to refute last year’s referen-

duns vue.

When he handed out the results at Monday
night’s EC meeting, White warned of the possible
inaccuracies of the informal poll.

In other action Monday night, the EC heard
budget reports from eight student organizations,
including the Mock Convention, which has receiv-
ed a $50,000 grant for the 1988 convention from the
Hatton Sumners Foundation, which donated
$25,000 for last spring's convention

“They liked it so much that they gave us double
what they gave us last year,” said Michael Shel-
ton, temporary tri-chairman.

Most of the organizations that reported were a
week late. The committee voted unanimously to
release the groups’ Business Office funds that
had been frozen when they failed to report.

The Frisbee Club, one of the organizations
whose funds were frozen last week, told senior re-
presentative David Jonson that they won’t need
any more EC funds because they are being
sponsored by a beer company.

Jonson suggested that the EC ask all student
organization leaders to attend the Jan. 14 EC
meeting to find out why so many organizations
weren't aware of the budget report schedule. His
motion passed 8-2.

Mesner

 

Continued from Page 1

Mesner’s case file gives the result of
an analysis of a blanket and two
sheets taken from the room of fire
victim Thomas J. Fellin.

“Several Caucasian hairs were
found on the blanket and sheets,”’ it
says. ‘“‘If...hairs...from Thomas
Fellin and the suspect are submitted,
comparisons can be made.”’

Read has requested subpoenas for
37 individuals from’ three states. He
also requested the long distance
telephone records from Oct. 1983 to
Oct. 1984 for Mesner’s home tel-
ephone number, listed in his father’s
name, and for a telephone number
listed in the name of Anita Hodges.

Frank W. Rogers, an associate of
Mesner defense attorney G. Marshall
Mundy, said Mesner plans to plead
not guilty. Mesner has also said in the
past that he will plead not guilty.

Rogers said it is uncertain whether
Mesner will testify. ‘‘We don’t know
at this point and we won’t know until
that day,’’ Rogers said. ‘‘He certain-
ly has the right not to.”’

In a letter to the three attorneys
dated Nov. 8, Honts stated that ‘‘the
Commonwealth has to prove beyond

a reasonable doubt that (1) the fire
was incendiary in origin (arson) and
(2) the defendant was the agent
thereof.”’

The April 11 fire, which gutted the
Fiji house, occurred during spring
break last school year.

Fellin, a 19-year-old sophomore
honor student who was co-president
of the fraternity, died in the blaze,
which was discovered at 4:45 a.m.

The medical examiner’s report sta-
ted that Fellin died of ‘‘smoke inhala-
tion, carbon monoxide poisoning due
to fire’ and that his body had been
“found on [the] next to bottom step of
({the] stairs, apparently trying to
leave [the] house.”

Mesner has been held in the Rock-
bridge County jail on $150,000 bail
since the day he was indicted. Honts
refused to reduce the bail at a Sept.
19 hearing. ‘‘The bond that has been
set in this matter is a proper bond,”
he said.

Mesner was visited in jail yester-
day by his father, his stepmother and
Lexington lawyer Eric L. Sisler, who
is working with Mundy on Mesner’s
defense. Mesner declined to talk with
a reporter.

Five other inmates were in his
upstairs cell yesterday afternoon.
Mesner said there were seven people
in the cell Tuesday night.

Arby’s drive-by window
favored by commission

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Lexington Planning Commis-
sion overturned a Lexington Public
Works Department recommendation
and voted 2-1 last Thursday to en-
dorse a request by Arby’s for a per-
mit for a drive-by window.

Several conditions were attached
to the recommendation that the Lex-
ington City Council approve the con-
ditional use permit for Arby’s, the
fast food restaurant located at 30 S.
MainSt.

City Manager John Doane sided
with the public works department
and voted against the recommenda-
tion. Commission members John De-
lany and Reid Agnor voted in favor of
the request. The other two members
were absent.

A public works department report
that had been requested by the com-
mission during its Nov. 8 meeting
listed four main reasons for opposing
the request.

Lexington attorney Bernard J.
Natkin, who along with local devel-
oper Clyde Mull represented Arby’s
at the meeting, said that ‘‘some of

these reports before the commission
just don’t make sense.”

“Shouldn’t this business, which
came here first, be given the chance
to compete with the others?’’ Natkin
asked. -

Natkin also said that he would have
no objection to a revocation clause
being included in the conditional use
permit. Mull said Arby’s would abide
by such a clause if one were included
in the permit.

“The drive-by window could be un-
done as fast as it was done,” Mull
said. ‘‘It won’t be that much of an ex-
pense.”

Mull told the commission that it
would take an average of three min-
utes to serve a customer using the
drive-by window. He added that the
McDonald’s in Lexington does not
have much more space for vehicles
in its drive-by window lane than Ar-
by’s would.

Doane questioned who would deter-
mine whether Arby’s was in violation
of the requirements of the permit if it
were granted. Doane also said there
would have to be ‘“‘substantial rea-
son’’ to revoke the permit once it has
been granted.

EC having trouble
with clubs’ reports

 

By JIM STRADER
Staff Reporter

 

A combination of lack of notifica-
tion and lack of response led to the
problems the Executive Committee
has had recently with student organi-
zations reporting on their budgets,
EC President Cole Dawson said.

Of the 17 student groups who re-
ceive funding from the student body
through the EC, only seven had
reported to the EC prior to Monday’s
meeting.

Dawson said it is important for the
groups to notify the EC of their finan-
cial situations so that the committee
can oversee the way in which the mo-
ney is spent and so that the various
organizations can rely on the EC in
the event that the groups have money
problems.

An example Dawson noted is the
Cold Check Committee. If for in-
stance, the committee is dealing with
a chronic offender, he said, the EC
should know about this if it threatens
the Cold Check Committee’s funds or
its effectiveness.

Some of the groups have not been
contacted early enough to allow them

 

to prepare a report for the EC, Daw-
son said. Dawson put this blame on
the EC. This may lead the groups to
be ignorant of the importance of re-
porting to the committee, he said.

Junior representative Pat Hayden
also noted that the EC had been slow

in contacting some groups, but added
that several organizations had been
contacted and had not shown up for a
meeting for two or three weeks. Hay-
den called this ‘‘blatant irresponsi-
bility on their part.”

At Monday night’s EC meeting,
nine groups presented their budget
reports to the committee, and the EC
voted to release their funds.

Dawson said he doesn’t expect pro-
blems in the future with the various
organizations. He thinks that mail-
boxes that wer? installed recently for
each of the groups will help with
notification of the groups.

The Executive Committee passed a
motion Monday night requiring all
chairmen of groups sponsored by the
EC to attend the next meeting of the
committee. The EC will explain to
them then that they must report reg-
ularly so that the EC can effectively
oversee their expenses and assist any
organization that may need help.

state Republicans
to meet in Staunton

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Chief Editor

 

A pep rally for officials of the
Virginia Republican party will be
held in Staunton this weekend in
preparation for the 1985 races for
governor, lieutenant governor, at-
torney general and the state legis-
lature.

Donald W. Huffman, chairman of

the state GOP, said the purpose of the
meeting is to foster party unity and
inform local organizers of their role
in the upcoming contests.

The retreat, which Huffman called
“a first-time thing for us,’’ will in-
clude the 75 members of the state
central committee and the state’s 125
unit chairmen, each of whom repre-
sents a particular city or county.

“The unit chairmen, I think, feel
they’re called up every time there’s
an election and they’re ignored at
other times,’’ said Huffman, a 1966
Washington and Lee Law School
graduate. ‘‘The idea is to give these
people an opportunity to have impact
in 1985.” :

He said local leaders will be en-
couraged to promote additional grass
roots party activity in their areas.
‘‘My job as I see it between now and
June is to preach party unity,” he ad-
ded.

Party candidates will be selected
at the state Republican convention in
Norfolk on May 31 and June 1. Del-
egates to the convention will be cho-
sen at mass meetings through the
state this winter.

W. Arthur Beeton, chairman of the
44-member Rockbridge Combined
Republican Committee, said the
local mass meeting is scheduled for
Wed., Jan. 23, at 8 p.m. in the county
courthouse.

Former Fairfax delegate Wyatt B.
Durrette Jr. and 8th District Con-
gressman Stan E. Parris have an-
nounced that they will seek the Re-
publican gubernatorial nomination.

“Philosophically, I don’t think
there are that many differences be-
tween them,” said Huffman, a for-
mer chairman of the Rockbridge
committee. ‘‘They’re both good men.
Either one would be good for the par-
by...
‘“‘Durrette is definitely the front-
runner at this point,’’ he continued.
He said Parris ‘‘has just got to go out
and get people to run for delegate
who will support him. That’s his job
at this point.”’

Huffman said former attorney gen-

Whose birthday
IS 1t,anyway?

The Episcopal Church believes the important news at Christmas is not
who comes down the chimney, but who came down from heaven. We invite you to come and join

us as we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.

The Episcopal Church

eral J. Marshall Coleman's an-
nouncement Monday that he would
run for lieutenant governor rather
than governor came as no surprise to
GOP leaders.

“‘T think he saw that he was not the
front-runner and thought he would be
a good candidate for lieutenant gov-
ernor,”’ he said, adding that he
agreed with that assessment.

The closeness of the contests will
not necessarily result in a divided
party after the June convention, Huf-
fman maintained.

“We've had hotly contested races
before that have been divisive, and
we've had hotly contested races that
weren’t,’’ he said. “‘It just depends on
the attitude of everybody. It needs to
be ‘let the best man win and then sup-
port the nominee of our party.’ ”’

The retreat speaker Friday night
will be New York businessman Lewis
E. Lehrman, a frequently mentioned
GOP presidential possibility. Lehr-
man is speaking this week in his role
as national chairman of Citizens for
America, a grassroots civic league
with a chairman in each of Virginia’s
10 Congressional districts.

At Saturday lunch, the
Republicans will hear from J. Wil-
liam Middendorf II, U.S. ambassa-
dor to the Organization for American
States, who will speak on Central
American issues.

J. Douglas Holladay, an associate
director of the White House public
liaison office, will speak Sunday on
religion in politics. Holladay’s office
said he specializes in education, fam-
ily and environmental issues and in
the concerns of Protestant churches.

Beeton, a 1939 W&L graduate, ex-
plained that mass meetings are open
and that anyone can attend. He said
the Rockbridge Combined Commit-
tee, which includes the county and
the cities of Lexington and Buena
Vista, will have 17 votes at the state
convention.

He said the meeting will elect dele-
gates who are then free to vote as
they wish at the convention.

He said he is unaware of any plan-
ned challenges to the Rockbridge
area representatives in the Virginia
General Assembly — Democrat
Frank W. Nolen, 24th District Sena-
tor; Republican S. Vance Wilkins Jr..,
delegate for the 24th District, includ-
ing northern Rockbridge County and
Lexington; and independent Lacey
E. Putney, delegate for the 19th
District, including southern
Rockbridge County and Buena Vista.

2 4, The Ri

Rezoning

 

From Staff Reports

 

The University’s targeted loca-
tion for the new dormitory is an
irea behind Davis and Gilliam
‘ormitories, where an uninhabi-
ed house, a bottling plant and
parking lots are now, according to
Frank A. Parsons, assistant to the
president.

Washington and Lee requested
ast week that the Lexington Plan-
ning Commission rezone the en-
tire area bounded by Nelson,
Washington and Lee streets so
that the dormitory can be con-
structed.

That area, with the exception of
the plot of land on which the Chi
Psi fraternity house sits, is in a
seneral residential zone, in which
construction of any building other
than a duplex (two-family unit) is
prohibited.

W&L hopes to have the property
rezOned into the central business
district, allowing the construction
f.the dormitory.

The planning commission has
tentatively scheduled a_ public
hearing on the request for Dec. 20
15 p.m. but that may be postpon-
ed for a week or two, Chairman
Henry L. Ravenhorst said.

W&L does not own all of the pro-
perty in the area it wants rezoned
and hopes to acquire some of that
property, Parsons said yesterday.

The Clifton Forge Ice & Bottling
Co, owns two plots of land near the
intersection of Nelson and Wash-
ington streets and Lucy P. Acker-
ly and William and Lucy P. Acker-
'y own the two plots of land next to
St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Church on Nelson Street, accord-
ing to records in the Lexington
commissioner of revenue’s office.

W&L is attempting to acquire
the land owned by both the bottl-
ing company and the Ackerly’s,
Parsons said. The house on the

\ckerly’s property has been unin-
habited for about two years, he
added.

“We know that the Coca-Cola
plant is interested and we know
that the Ackerly family is inter-
ested in selling,” Parsons said.

That location was chosen for the
new dormitory because of its
proximity to the Warner Center,
other housing and the academic
campus, said Parsons, who is

chairman of the Residential Ac-

commodations subcommittee of
the Coeducation Steering Commit-
tee.

The dormitory is expected to ac-

commodate about 240 students,
most of whom probably will be up-
perclassmen or law students, Par-
sons said. It is hoped that the dor-
mitory would be completed in
time to open in September 1987.

The dormitory also would fea-
ture some “‘common space,’’ such
as kitchens or lounges, on each
hall, Parsons added.

A “concept” for the new dor-
mitory will be presented to the
board of trustees at its meeting
next month, Parsons said.

At its last meeting, the board
authorized the University ‘‘to pur-
sue the purchase of the property,”’
Parsons said.

The Richmond architectural
firm of Marcellus, Wright, Cox &
Smith will design the building
with the help of GWSM Inc., land-
scape architects from Pittsburgh,
Parsons said.

By May, the committee hopes to
have a “more refined’’ plan to
present to the board, and Parsons
said construction, which is ex-
pected to last 18 to 20 months,
should begin by Ootober.

If the land is acquired, Parsons
said, the University also hopes to
turn the intersection of Nelson and
Washington streets into another
entrance onto campus in “‘an in-

Land the University is seeking to purchase Fd

192.0

 

viting and attractive way.”’

The University has informed
area residents about the planning
commission’s upcoming public
hearing, said Parsons, who added
that he is planning to attend the
hearing.

The current zones were estab-
lished after the Davis, Baker and
Gilliam dormitories had been
built, which is why those dormi-
tories can exist on property in a
general residential zone, accord-
ing to Ravenhorst.

If the University is unable to ac-
quire the bottling company pro-
perty and the Ackerly property, it
may try to build the dormitory on
what property it does own in the
area or will consider other loca-
tions, Parsons said.

Additional University housing is
needed because of the increase in
the student body expected as a re-
sult of coeducation next fall and
the fact that women often are
more likely to want to live on cam-
pus, Parsons said.

The University also investi-
gated the possibility of buying the
land along Washington Street bet-
ween the bottling plant and Gil-
liam Dormitory but was informed
it is not for sale, Parsons said.

Christmas shopping

 

By JIMSTRADER
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee students
either are not aware that Christmas
is in three weeks or they are planning
to do their shopping at home, accord-
ing to many of the merchants in Lex-
ington.

Local business people say few stu-
dents have been making the rounds
of city stores in recent weeks. Bill
Mason of the Lexington Dry Goods
Co. said that up to this point, it ap-
pears that W&L students aren’t plan-
ning to do their shopping in town. His
store has had a drastic price reduc-
tion on its entire stock since the day
after Thanksgiving, he said, but busi-
ness has not picked up.

Caroline Brown, also of Lexington
Dry Goods, said that ‘‘it may not
have hit them yet’’ that the holidays
are so close. On the other hand, she
added, students might just be plan-
ning to wait until they get home to
shop.

That practice is what Alvin-Dennis
owner Alvin Carter is trying to fight.
Carter stressed that students should
“stay away from the big city
crowds”’ and do Christmas shopping
here in Lexington. He said that a
good number of W&L students shop
in his store... ““We try to encourage
it.’ The most popular items for
Christmas this year, he said, are
accessory items such as belts, ties
and cuff links. These are more
salable than suits, he added.

Also big sellers, Carter said, are
flannel shirts and sweaters. One stu-
dent shopping at Alvin-Dennis said
he was doing his own Christmas
shopping. ‘‘My mother doesn’t know
what I want and I know where to find
what I want in Lexington,” he said.
He said that he planned to do all of his

other Christmas shopping at home.

The Lexington Shop for Pappagallo
seems to appeal more to law students
than to undergraduates, according to
Maryjohn Payne and Susan Craw-
ford, the owners. They said that those
students who do shop at Pappagallo
tend to buy presents along the lines of
jewelry, purses, gloves, belts or
sweaters. Most of the shopping
seems to be done for mothers and
girlfriends, they said.

Crawford stressed the advantages
of shopping in Lexington. ‘Who

 

issiow...

wants to hassle with shopping when
you get home? Get it out of the way
now.”

Most stores are planning some type
of Christmas special for shoppers.
There are extended shopping hours
planned in many of the downtown
stores this Saturday night in conjunc-
tion with the Chamber of Com-
merce’s ‘Holiday in Lexington”
weekend. The stores participating
will be open until 8 p.m. Saturday,
and many are planning to serve re-
freshments for shoppers.

To help kick off the Christmas
season, the Lexington-Rockbridge
County Chamber of Commerce is
sponsoring two events this weekend.

Tomorrow evening’s Lexington
Christmas Parade will feature the re-
turn of the award-winning military
color guard from Washington and
Lee’s military science department.

W&L’s color guard last year won
first prize for best marching unit.
The color guard is under the com-
mand of junior Tony Pfaff, the W&L
Ranger Company executive officer.

The Christmas Parade begins at
6:30 p.m. at Lexington High School,
travels down Main Street and turns
onto Nelson Street, where it disbands
in the Maxway parking lot.

said this week he is working on the
plans with architect Jim Wheeler of
Dallas. The planning commission
recommended to the city council Oct.
11 that the conditional use permit be
granted tothe fraternity.

A public hearing on the conditional
use permit application has been
scheduled for tonight’s meeting of
the city council. Council is expected

to decide at that time whether to

grant the permit.

Ravenhorst said that ‘general
clean-up work”’ is underway on the

If council approves the conditional
use permit, the contractor would
then submit the plans of the house to
Lexington Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Don J. Mette. If Mette
approves the plans, he would then is-
sue a building permit allowing the
construction of the house to begin.

Assembling next year’s University
Catalogue has proven to be a much
more difficult task than normal, As-
sociate Dean of the College Pamela
Simpson said last week.

Simpson said she wasn’t certain
exactly when the catalog will be
finished. There are two major rea-
sons why the book has run into trou-
ble.

First, Director of Publications
Romulus T. Weatherman is ill. The
task of preparing the catalog has
been turned over to News Office Di-
rector Jeff Hanna and Weatherman’s
secretary, Joyce Harris, who have
been working on the catalog since the
beginning of October.

Secondly, the decision to admit
women has added a new twist to the
book. Hanna and Harris are present-
ly making sure that there will be a
consistency in gender references.

‘‘The adopted policy is that we will
avoid gender-specific pronouns,”
Simpson said.

Similarly, the National Council of
Churches recently produced an ex-
perimental selection of Bible pas-
sages in which female references
were added and neutral language
was substituted for male terms. In
this new version of the scriptures,

and

Weatherman’s absence probably
will result in a marked decrease in
the number of new pictures in next
year’s catalog.

At a faculty meeting this month,
each department will announce any
changes to be made in the book. Each
section is sent to the corresponding
department to check accuracy.

Simpson stressed that accuracy in
the catalog is extremely important.
There is a contractual agreement be-
tween the faculty and the students
that guarantees that a student may
graduate under any catalog issued
during his tenure at the University,
Simpson said.

Next year’s catalog will include the
General Education Requirements for
graduation as well as the new compu-
ter science major courses and re-
quirements.

Harold Jackson.

  

Why did the chicken cross the road’?

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

A remodeled Kentucky Fried
‘Chicken will open on Nelson Street in
“April, and it will feature more of a
dining room atmosphere that will be
“very nice for the community,” ac-
cording to Harold Jackson, director
of real estate and construction for
‘Kentucky Fried Chicken.

Jackson said in a telephone inter-
‘view from his office in Columbia,
-Tenn., that ‘‘the former lot we oc-
cupied was substandard— it was not
*big enough to handle the sales that
,we feel arehere.”’

“The leased building was old and
yneeded remodeling, so instead of
pouring $100,000 to $125,000 into a
building that is not even ours, we de-
cided to purchase our own property,”
he explained.

He called the renovation an exam-
‘ple of ‘“‘image enhancement.”’ Every
seven to 10 vears Kentucky Fried

Chicken tries to update its facilities
so it will remain attractive to custo-
mers, he said.

Jackson said the new restaurant,
which will be located across the
street from the old location, will
feature a drive-through window as
well, but the real emphasis will be
placed on creating a ‘‘family-type
dining area.”

The dining room will have a blue
and gray color scheme. ‘‘We unders-
tand that there are some colleges in
that town of Lexington,’ Jackson
chuckled.

Jackson said his business doesn’t
fee] the need to compete with Lexing-
ton’s hamburger restaurants be-
cause he feels the businesses draw
different clientele.

‘We figure that they’re comple-
mentary,” he said. ‘‘McDonald’s will
attract more of the student trade, but
by drawing these crowds, we will
also benefit because people will eat
with us to avoid that rushed feeling.”

Christmas party
a success for IU

 

‘By PETER BOATNER
Staff Reporter

 

’ “Anunmitigated success.’

_ That is how Independent Union
Vice President Luke Cornelius de-
‘scribed Saturday night’s IU Christ-
mas party, held in the Cockpit and
featuring music by the Nabobs.

* “It was really a do-or-die situa-
tion,’ Cornelius said. ‘‘Nobody an-
ticipated the success we had, but it
‘was really a good crowd, good band
and good time.”’

The party, similar to a Wednesday
‘night in the Pit, featured free pop-
.corn, discount beer prices and egg-
nog supplied by the senior class at
‘Southern Seminary Junior College.

The party ‘“‘worked well in terms of
planning further events,” which ten-
"tatively include a party with South-
yern Seminary in late January and a
Fancy Dress alternative to the closed
"fraternity parties.

“A lot of guys aren’t comfortable
with the fraternities,” Cornelius
said. “If you’re an independent, or
-you’re from another house, you feel
,you’re on somebody else’s ground.

WLUR to carry
Met opera Sat.

Rossini’s ‘‘The Barber of Seville”
»will be broadcast live from the stage
,of the Metropolitan Opera House Sat-

urday, Dec. 8, at 2 p.m. on WLUR-
*FM (91.5 FM).
. Silvio Varviso will conduct the pro-
duction, which will feature Kathleen
‘Battle, Dalmacio Gonzalez, Leo Nuc-
ci and Enzo Dara.

WLUR-FM will carry all 20 Metro-
‘politan Opera broadcasts of the Met’s

1984-85 season.

With the IU, you have input, and
you're not gate-crashing.”’

Any independent can make sugges-
tions and vote at IU meetings, which
are informal and open.

“We just want to hear people’s
ideas,”’ Cornelius said. ‘‘We’re al-
ways looking for more independents
to take an interest, and hopefully
we’ll have a very good turnout”’ after
Saturday night’s bash.

But, as Cornelius said, the IU “‘is
not just a party organization.’’ It also
takes an active part in the intramu-
ral sports program. The Independent
Union sponsored a champion rac-
quetball team in this term’s in-
tramurals and interest in next term’s
teams is already ‘really great,’’ he
added.

“There are a lot more sports in the
winter term, so it will be a big thing
then,” Cornelius said. Any indepen-
dent can sign up for IM’s with the
Union.

Five guys who are good friends and
will show up for the games can come
to us and we'll sponsor them,’’ he ad-
ded.

Also, someone who just wants to
play a sport can sign up for one of the
TU’s teams.

“Theoretically, we can put a team
together out of 500 guys, as opposed
to 60 for the fraternities,’’ Cornelius
said. “It doesn’t work that way, but
we can sponsor as many people as we
want.”

Academically, the Independent
Union is trying to put together a
“cold test” file:

“By next term, we hope to have a
well organized and all-inclusive ‘cold
test’ file. Anybody who brings in an
old test will have access to the file,
and we’ll make copies of their old
tests for them,’’ Cornelius explained.

A system for peer counseling and
advice also is being arranged.

broken

One of the front glass doors of
the University Center was broken
during a Cockpit party for law
students, according to assistant
proctor Burr Datz, who is investi-
gating the incident.

Datz said today that Lexington
Police Officer Phil Joines disco-
vered the broken glass door dur-
ing a routine check on the Cockpit
party, which featured the Nabobs.

“He walked into the Cockpit and
the door was fine,” Datz said,
“and when he walked out it was
broken.”’

Datz has no leads in the case
and asks that anyone with infor-
mation about the incident contact
him or University proctor Charles
“Murph” Murray.

The door, still in one piece with
tape over the cracks in the glass,
will cost about $150 to replace,
Datz estimated.

 

 

Still kicking

Youth soccer league thrives in Big Lex

 

By JON THORNTON
Staff Reporter

 

Early autumn mornings for Lex-
ington youngsters are no longer re-
served for cartoons, sleeping late or
even Little Leauge football games.
Some 250 children, ages six to 14, are
now aspiring soccer stars in the Lex-
ington Youth Soccer League, founded
seven years ago by Frederic L. Kir-
gis Jr., dean of the Washington and
Lee law school. The league is divided
into three age groups and both boys
and girls can compete in its 10 Satur-
day fall season.

There are many members of the
W&L community who help make this
program extremely different from
other youth athletic programs that
suffer from the “Little League Syn-

drome.” There are no screaming
parents who expect their kids to be
Peles, nor are there scuffles or ill
feelings between members of oppos-
ing teams. Rather than the ‘‘win at
all costs,’’ Lombardi-style philoso-
phy that often finds its way into these
programs, the coaches say this lea-
gue stresses the participation and the
excitement of having fun while play-
ing the game.

“The pressure is virtually non-
existent here,’ said Jeff Hanna, the
W&L News Office director and coach
of the Lexington Panthers. ‘‘The par-
ents are so supportive, and that’s
really good for the kids.”

Journalism professor Hampden
Smith, another of the Panther coach-
es, said that ‘“‘some coaches have
been let go because they were too in-
tent on winning.”’

Both Smith and Hanna have sons
playing in the league. Smith, whose
daughter formerly played in the pro-
gram, calls his first year of coaching
a ‘‘den mother sort of thing.’’

History Professor J. Holt Mer-
chant, who began as a coach in the
league seven years ago, said that ini-
tially the league was total chaos.”
But thanks to W&L soccer coach Rolf
Piranian, Dean Kirgis, and the ef-
forts of many other members of the
W&L faculty, including Alfred Fra-
lin, Barry Machado, Taylor Sanders,
John Knox, Michael Pleva and
Thomas Williams, the program, Mer-
chant said, has vastly improved.
Merchant calls it ‘‘phenomenal,”’ but
he is now a referee in the league be-
cause as a coach he was ‘‘so nasty on
the sidelines’ and he found himself
‘‘abusing six-year olds.”’

Early Decision number higher

 

From Staff Reports

 

The admissions office received
more than twice as many Early Deci-
sion applications as it did last year,
and total applications have increased
by 61 percent.

The deadline for Early Decision
applications was Dec. 1, and the
University received the prayerfully
prepared applications of 191 high
school seniors — 54 of them women
—whose first choice of college is
Washington and Lee.

Last year’s Early Decision pool
consisted of 90 students—none of
them women.

Acceptance notifications will be
mailed Dec. 15, and admissions coun-
selor Bennett L. Ross said that usual-
ly about half of Early Decision appli-
cants are accepted.

“It’s not inconceivable that we’ll
have a fourth of our class filled from
Early Decision,”’ Ross said. The tar-
get class size is 400 students, includ-
ing 80 to 100 women.

A number of students submit appli-
cations in the fall but are not Early
Decision candidates. The total num-

ber of applicants to date is 351 men
and 127 women — a total of 478, com-
pared to 297 at this time last year.

“If we continue this trend, we’ll
have 1,800 applications for next
year’s freshman class, with 300 to 400
of them from women,” Ross said.
The admissions office received appli-
cations from 1,502 students last year
and offered admission to 60 percent
of them.

“So far the quality looks good —not
just quantity,’’ Ross said of the Early
Decision pool. ‘‘I think we’ll have a
class with good balance — a well-
rounded class.”

‘‘As far as the quality of the female
applicants we’ve had so far, some
look good on paper; others don’t,”
Ross said. “That perhaps reflects
what we’ve seen from male applica-
tions in the past.”’

He said many of the applicants
have been involved in student gov-
ernment and other activities. ‘‘Their
strength is not just based on their
SAT, class rank or GPA,”’ he said.
“It’s also involvement and leader-
ship — these are people who will take
an active interest in W&L.”’

Police make RAID on DUls

 

From Staff Reports

 

The new Report All Intoxicated
Drivers (RAID) program began this
week in Lexington. The purpose, as
might be guessed from the title, is to
stem drunk driving.

Under the program, anyone who
suspects a motorist of driving under
the influence is encouraged to notify
police.

Police Chief L.O. Sutton said the
program is ‘‘to help police find drunk
drivers.’’ He made the point that this

was not an opportunity for one angry
neighbor to get back at another.

‘“‘We don’t want someone calling us
up and telling us someone’s driving
drunk...just to get them in trouble,”’
he added.

To report a drunk driver, call the
Lexington Police Department at
463-2112. You will need to give a de-
scription of the car, its location and
your name. Sutton said that the
investigating officer will only stop
the car if he observes the usual char-
acteristics of a drunk driver.

Ross said the avalanche of re-
quests for campus tours and inter-
views continues. ‘‘October and Nov-
ember are traditionally the heaviest
months, but January is no cakewalk,
either,’’ he added.

‘We have a commitment to single
interviews and the personal contact
we want to maintain at a school like
this, but we also have a commitment
to spending time with these applica-
tions and doing enough analysis,” he
said. ‘‘It’s balancing those two.”’

Ross said the female proportion of
each class will be ‘‘scaled upward”
until 1992, when the plan is to have a
student body of 1,500, including 1,000
or more men and 400 to 500 women—
‘‘a 60-40 split.” The present student
body size is 1,350.

“There will be a_ significant
concentration of women, but not at
the expense of men,”’ he said.

 

 

“You see, I’m somewhat hyperac-
tive,”’ he explained.

Merchant said he wanted to stay in-
volved and contribute to the pro-
gram, so he began officiating. Three
years ago he became a qualified high
school official when he became in-
volved with the Lexington High
School soccer program, which was
also founded by many of the same
W&L soccer enthusiasts. He is now
qualified for the college ranks.

Merchant said he and the other
faculty members involved in the lea-
gue are “going out of their way to
educate parents and the kids’’ with
their philosophy of athletics.

“We're having fun, and that’s
what’s important,”’ he said. ‘““W&L
makes it possible for us to exist. We
owe so much to Dick Miller and Bill
McHenry.”

Cagers win fourth at home

 

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team got 16 points each from
senior co-captains Kevin McClatchy
and Scott Shannon in raising its
season record to 4-3 with a 67-51 win
over Averett College last night.

McClatchy hit five of his eight
shots from the floor and was a per-
fect six of six from the free throw line
in his best performance of the year.

Shannon was good on eight of his 12
field goal attempts and led all re-
bounders with nine.

The Generals were sluggish during
the first 10 minutes of the game, lead-
ing by only six points at 16-10. W&L
then slowed the tempo, holding the
ball for 3:30 before David Wilkinson
broke free for a short jumper to up
the lead to eight points. The Generals
then pulled away from the Cougars to
hold a 25-14 halftime lead.

Averett kept the game close during
the first 10 minutes of the second
half, trailing at one point by only five
points at 37-32.

The Generals thwarted the Cou-
gars’ comeback attempt, extending
their lead to 14 points at 50-36 after
senior Bill Yates’ three-point play
with 7:19 remaining in the game.

W&L continued to add to its lead as
the fouling Averett team sent the
Generals to the charity line 19 times
during the second half, with 16 of
those 19 being converted.

W&L had its biggest lead of the
night, 61-41, with 3:12 remaining be-
fore holding on to win by the final
margin of 16 points.

“There were some good signs to-
night,’ head coach Verne Canfield
said. “‘Kevin came out of his slump,
and Scott hada good game.

“T’m not satisfied. We’re still fight-
ing it a little bit,’’ Canfield added.
“We’re not playing consistently.
We're not satisfied with 4-3. I’m go-
ing topush them.”

In earlier action, W&L split its pair
of games with North Carolina teams,
UNC-Greensboro and Greensboro
College.

Last Thursday, the Generals de-
feated UNC-Greensboro at home,
76-64,

W&L trailed by as many as 15

the Spartans before reeling off 11
straight points to pull within six
points, 37-31, at halftime.

The second half was dominated by
WA&L as the Generals shot 76 percent

from the floor. W&L hit 28 of its 45
free throw attempts, also, compared
to just eight of 16 for the Spartans.

Yates pumped in 25 points to lead
the Generals, including 11 of 13 free
throws. David Wilkinson scored 10
points in the win.

Thursday in the Warner Center. The Generals also won
last night to move their record to4-3.

“We were down a little bit in the
first half,’’ Canfield said. ‘‘We were
patient, and they eventually played
into our hands.”’

The Generals’ road game woes
continued Saturday as Greensboro
College soundly defeated W&L 83-59
in Greensboro.

Greensboro jumped out to a 44-30
halftime lead in coasting to the easy
win.

W&L had a dismal shooting night
against the Hornets, connecting on
only 39 percent of its shots. The Gene-
rals also committed 21 turnovers.

Sophomore Jeff Harralson led the
Generals with his 15 points and six re-
bounds. Shannon tallied 14 points
against the Hornets.

Greensboro shot 59.6 percent
against W&L as every Hornet player
scored in the win.

W&L is now a perfect 4-0 at home
during the season, but has lost all
three of its road contests.

“T totally believe in these guys,”’
Canfield said. “If we can get a high
level of consistency, we can achieve
the goals we’ve set. We've got a
tough road ahead of us.”’

The Generals return to action over
the Christmas break when they tra-
vel to Pennsylvania for the Franklin
and Marshall Tournament on Jan. 4

LL Officiating, it seems, has come

under greater attack in the past few months than at any time in recent ’
memory. We have seen examples of. the problem in football games, -
(see Texas, Richmond) tennis matches (McEnroe’s cannot in full be .
disputed), basketball games (Monday night in Cameron Hall) and
almost every athletic contest where the decisions of an arbiter of the
court or field play an important role, :

What one has to ask is 1) Are these questionings legitimate? and 2)
What, if anything, can be done about this state of affairs? It cannot be
denied that a referee’s decision can be instrumental, indeed more im-
portant than a player’s ability, in the outcome of an athletic contest. ’
Yes, that’s right, despite all of you out there who were brought up
under that admirable but not always correct philosophy that ‘‘you
never lose a game because of the officials.’’ True winners rise above ,
such trivial things as an official’s mistake, we are told.

Well, children, as we go about how things really happen, the above
just doesn’t cut it. An official can hold that old intangible, Momentum,
in the palm of his hand, and each little whistle blow is a plus or a minus
for your team’s chances. Given that one mistaken whistle at a key
point in a game most certainly has the potential to send the game one y
way or the other.

And therein lies the problem. If you can have games being decided
by inept whistle blowers rather than the abilities of the participants
then I think you have to say that’s something wrong.

Therefore, it is obvious poor officiating can detract from the playing
of the game. John McEnroe — and by no means am I advocating that
everyone adopt a code of conduct similar to his — questions not only y
calls but those making the calls, and he may be right on target this
time.

If we supposedly have athletes who in some sense are the best in
their area, should we not also have officials to match that level of pro-
ficiency? Even the lowliest, 19th-string offensive tackle has to practice
everyday. Should not officials, who are on the field more than any
player, have this same level of practice so they are prepared to meet
any situation? Granted, again, that officials go through training pro-
grams and are evaluated periodically. But surely something’s not up
to snuff when you have situations like those for the Longhorns{his fall,
or like that experienced by Marty Fletcher’s Keydets Monday night.
We're talking Division I here, the highest level of NCAA basketball,
and we’ve got calls being made that you'd expect from a 15-year-old
refereeing CYO games. It might not be fair to attack someone’s judg-
ment, but then games’ being decided by those not playing isn’t fair
either.

The conclusion to all this is not cheery, however. Officials can be on-
ly human, and therefore mistake-prone. Stronger requirements,
tougher tests and more explicit scrutiny must be part of the solution. ‘
Another part is probably pay. (I mean, not many of us wanted to be
referees when we grew up, but if it became financially worth the ef-
fort, who’s to say quality wouldn’t improve.) It may be trite, but if no
bad calls are made, no one’s going to complain, and I do think that’s a
possibility...

Last weekend, the Division III
Washington and Lee Generals finish-
ed third in the Virginia Intercol-
legiate Swimming and Diving Cham-
pionships. Although the rest of the
field was composed of Division I
teams, the Generals, with 298 points,
finished behind James Madison (703
points) and William and Mary (397)
and ahead of VMI (296). Since the
team record depends only on dual
meets, the Generals still are 2-0.

The Generals didn’t finish in third
place because of poor times; actual-
ly, they swam faster this week than
they did last week when they defeat-
ed Johns Hopkins. Rather, the finish
was because of the small bench the
team had. Many swimmers sat out
the meet because it interfered with
Friday’s classes.

‘We gave up points to help grade
point averages,’’ Coach Page Remil-
lard said, ‘“‘which is part of the team

Grapplers 3rd in Invitational

 

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee Universi-
ty wrestling team finished third last
weekend in the Washington and Lee
Invitational at the Warner Center.
The Generals, with 54 1-2 points,
finished behind the champion York
(Pa.) College (74) and runner-up
Hiram (72).

“It was a good team performance.
Third place is a respectable finish,”
head wrestling coach Gary Franke
said.

Franke said that he thought that
his team could have finished’ higher
last weekend if the team had not lost

so many semifinal matches. Eight
Generals qualified for the semis, but

the point differences between first
and third place is significant enough
to hurt a team. The champion earns
10 points for his team while the third-
place finisher receives only four.

Coach Franke did add that his
team did very well in the consolation
finals.

Winning first place honors for the
Generals last weekend were Jeff Dix-
on and Joe O'Neill. Dixon defeated
Jim Ludden of Scranton to success-
fully defend the title that he won in
this tournament last year at 190 lbs.,
while O’Neill defeated Hans Kirr of
Hiram in the finals of the 177 lb. com-
petition.

Junior Larry Anker also placed
high for the Generals last weekend,
earning runner-up laurels at the 142
Ib. weight class.

(fourth place, 167 Ibs.), Jeff Mazza
(fourth place, 134 Ibs.), Brian Lifsted
(fourth-place, 126 lbs.), and Steve
Castle and Dave Cox with a third-and
a fourth-place finish at the 118 Ib.
class.

The reason for two Generals plac-
ing in the same weight class was that
W&L was able to field a B-team to fill
in some of the open spots left by
teams not having wrestlers in certain
weight classes.

The Generals had scheduled to
meet Lynchburg in their second dual
meet of the season and their last
match before Christmas break last
night at Warner Center, but the bad
weather prevented Lynchburg from
traveling to Lexington. The Generals
are scheduled to return to action
Saturday, Jan. 5, ina four-team tour-

philosophy and our program.”

While the whole team swam well,

freshman Eric Sullivan was the most
notable. He won the 500-yard free-
style in 4:45.6 and the 1,650-yard
freestyle in 16:47.87. Both times
qualified him for the NCAA Division
III Championships. Also qualifying
for the NCAAs was sophomore Jay
ReVille, who finished in second place
on the 400-yard individual medley
with a time of 4:17.58.

“T can’t think of a guy who had a
poor performance,’’ Remillard said.
“T can think of a lot of good swim-
ming.”

Under the category of ‘‘good swim-
ming” came three freshmen: Simon
Perez, who finished third in the 100-
yard breaststroke (1:03.05), Andy
Forbes, who won the consolation fin-
al in the 100-yard backstroke (59.51)
and Craig Garneau, the consolation
final winner of the 200-yard breast-
stroke (2:02.04). According to Remil-
lard, all of the freshmen have beaten
their personal lifetime best times,
which usually doesn’t happen until
February.

“IT surpassed my lifetime in the
first meet versus VMI,” Garneau
said. “It’s because of water polo, we

It wasn’t exactly your Super

that this game’s participants ex-
hibited the same type of intensity
as their professional counter-
parts.

Of course, we're talking about
Monday’s championship game of
the inaugural season for freshmen
intramural football. The team of
freshmen coached by dorm coun-
selor Dan DuPre was just too
much to handle for the squad
coached by counselor Tom Mack
as DuPre’s crew ran away from
Mack’s squad, 21-7.

The two teams, both from the
second floor of Graham-Lees
Dormitory, earned their ways to
the final following a long regular
season and grueling playoffs that
saw both start out as wild cards,
earning their place in the finals
with wins in last week’s semifi-

“That's the purpose of water polo,”’
junior David Lewis said. ‘‘It builds
speed, and guys usually beat lifetime
now or at the very end of the season.”’

Like many athletes at Washington
and Lee, the swimmers will report
back to school on Dec. 26 to resume
practices. The team members say
they are not thrilled with the shorten-
ed vacation but that they support its
purpose.

“I know hard work will pay off in
the end,’’ Lewis said. ‘‘I’m not going
back on Dec. 26 to swim slow.”’

While Lewis laughed, teammate
Garneau added, ‘‘And I don’t wake
up at 6 a.m. to weightlift to do poorly,
either.”

The swim team members say they
recognize the value of hard work.

“T think we can do as well as we
want this season,’’ Garneau said.
“We've got the coaching and we
practice hard.”

The last competition before the
Christmas vacation is the Senior In-
vitationals in Charlottesville Dec. 15

Debaters, Falwell’s students argue religion

 

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

 

LYNCHBURG — The same day
the Rev. Jerry Falwell’s lawyers
gave their opening arguments in the
libel trial pitting them against the
self-proclaimed ‘‘Mr. Sleaze,’’ better
known as Hustler publisher Larry
Flynt, two Washington and Lee de-
bate team members roadtripped to
Falwell’s Liberty Baptist College for
a debate on school prayer.

The topic of Monday evening's de-
bate was ‘‘Resolved: America should
have voluntary prayer in public
schools.” Liberty Baptist freshmen
Jamie Lund and Jeff Baity took the
affirmative viewpoint while W&L
juniors Ted LeClercq and Bob Kelly
found themselves on the ‘‘liberal’’
side of the question. At the conclusion
of the debate, the 58 students in the
audience were asked to choose not a
winner, but to choose whether they
were in favor of the resolution.

Although the affirmative support-
ers outnumbered the negative back-
ers 43-15, LeClercq and Kelly ap-
peared to have drawn some of ‘‘Jer-
ry’s kids”’ to their side.

Following an opening prayer that
was inoffensive to most, Lund pre-
sented the affirmative position. Lund
argued that the strict interpretation
of the First Amendment creates fear
and uncertainty, leads to the loss of
various religious freedoms and fur-
ther reinterpretations of the Consti-
tution, causes a reduction in patri-

“Hansel and Gretel,” the
familiar fairy tale written by
the brothers Grimm and set to
music in the late 19th century
by Engelbert Humperdinck,
will be performed in Lexington
Sunday by the Ensemble Com-
pany of the Cincinnati Opera.

The 3 p.m. performance at
Lexington High School, spon-
sored by Rockbridge Concert-
Theatre Series, is one of the
activities of the ‘Holiday in
Lexington’’ weekend.

In the production, the witch is
played by a male and Hansel is
portrayed by a female.

 

otism and hurts America’s reputa-
tion as a free country.

Lund never proposed a plan or
defined the terms of the resolution
being debated, although he was ques-
tioned by both the opponents and
members of the audience. According
to proper debate procedures, the bur-
den of proof was placed on Liberty
Baptist to show a need for change
and to present a workable plan. Be-
cause they did not define the terms of
the resolution or present a definite
plan, the Liberty Baptist students
lost on strictly technical terms.

In contrast to Lund’s overly brisk
speaking style, Kelly presented
W&L’s opening arguments in a very
relaxed manner. The negative case
was that there is no need to change
the status quo because it does not
prevent any students from silent
prayer. Also, argued Kelly, an
amendment in favor of school prayer
is ‘‘against God’s Word and Scrip-
ture.”’

Kelly attempted to prove his case
by showing that there is no attitudi-
nal or structural barrier preventing
silent prayer. ‘‘On this point we are
reminded of the cartoon we saw a few
days ago,” said Kelly. ‘‘As long as
there are history tests, there will
always be prayers in the schools.”’

Kelly cited Matthew 6, verses five
through seven, to illustrate his point
about the Word of God.

After a brief recess, Baity present-
ed a very ministerial type of argu-
ment in both tone and content, con-
tending that the Supreme Court has

Cincinnati Opera’s version of
the 90-minute opera is sung in
English by its resident compa-
ny of professional artists ‘‘EC-
CO!”’. The traveling production
is staged by Gordon Ostrowski,
““ECCO!”’ stage director, under
the direction of Cincinnati Ope-
ra General Director James de
Blasis.

“ECCO!”’ was created in Oct-
ober 1980 as the culmination of
the Cincinnati Opera’s first Ed-
ucation/Outreach plan. The
program brought opera and the
singing voice to over 90,000 peo-
ple last season.

“Hansel and Gretel” is the

misinterpreted the First Amendment
to the Constitution to such an extent
that the Constitution has decreased
to no value. “Any violation of one
freedom is the violation of all
freedoms...,"’ said Baity, who asked
how a child praying in school is vio-
lating the Constitution while the Su-
preme Court opens each session ask-
ing for God’s guidance and the incar-
cerated are given the right to see a
priest.

LeClercq followed with the second
negative speech. ‘“‘We only advocate
freedom of choice for all,” said the
W&L junior. LeClercq cited the Sov-
iet Union and Iran as examples of
countries that forced beliefs on peo-
ple, and said he did not feel people
should look to the state, the teachers,
and the school boards to orchestrate
and initiate prayer.

Debate moderator Cecil Kramer
then opened the floor to ‘audience
heckling,’ but there was very little
heckling from the students, who ask-
ed questions of both teams and made
speeches supporting both sides.

The heckling session provided
some of the liveliest discourse, al-
though much of it focused on Bible
study and holiday celebrations,
neither of which were covered by the
resolution at hand. Some of the stu-
dents cited Scripture and explained
that Kelly’s reference to the book of
Matthew was taken out of context.
Neither of the W&L debaters attemp-
ted to argue scripture or religious
history with the throng of Liberty
Baptist students.

“Kids have no sense of God any-
more. They think He’s a science fic-
tion character,”’ said one student,
who noted that Congress begins each
session with a prayer. Kelly respond-
ed that a sense of God must come
from the home and that one must dif-
ferentiate between maturity levels of
Congressmen and grade-school stu-
dents. ‘‘I think the safest thing to do
is take a neutral stance on an issue,”
he said.

One young woman asked what
harm would be done by a voluntary,
teacher-led silent ‘prayer. Kelly said
this would cause peer pressure on im-
pressionable children. ‘‘Peer pres-
sure’s put on everywhere. Give me a
real answer,’’ she retorted.

An argument mentioned by W&L
debate coach Halford Ryan on the
way to Lynchburg appeared to be one
of the negative side’s most effective.
“What if you don’t want to have your
relationship with God at 8:30 in the
morning?’’ queried Ryan.

‘“‘Why must religion be pushed on
them? Why must there be a set
time?” asked one member of the au-
dience. ‘‘I felt that prayer was need-
ed in schools...(but) there’s not a set
time to pray.”

‘You can pray before you go to
school, or you can find time. I found
time,”’ said a former public school
student who was greeted with a
round of applause.

The audience participation was
still dominated by pro-affirmative
speakers.

Philadelphia, both juniors at Wash-
ington and Lee, have been named the
winners of the Lewis Kerr Johnson
Commerce Scholarship for 1984-85.

The Johnson Commerce Scholar-
ship was created in 1974 by many
friends of Lewis Kerr Johnson, the
late professor of administration and
head of the administration depart-
ment at Washington and Lee.

The scholarship is awarded toa ris-
ing junior majoring in business ad-
ministration and seriously planning a
business career. Equal consideration
is given to academic record and non-
academic achievement, including

freshmen and sophomores) has been
stressed.”’

Haywood acknowledged that sell-
ing a ticket to an ABC agent without
checking to see if he had a college ID
“twas a mistake on our part’’ and that
“there were a lot of intoxicated peo-
ple there.”

However, he added, training the
nearly 60 students who worked at the
party would be difficult, and barten-
ders often have difficulty determin-
ing when people are intoxicated and
thus should not be served beer.

During Monday evening’s Execu-
tive Committee meeting, several
members expressed concern about
the pavilion party.

“I guess it was probably because I
was sober, but people were pretty out
of hand,” Secretary Sam Dalton said.

Vice President James White said,
‘People were pushing up (toward the
stage), and I could see how we could
have another Who concert.”

First-year law representative
James Crutchfield said, ‘I’m not ad-
vocating banning drinking there, but
I think it’s something we should look
at seriously.”

“T think it’s worthwhile consider-

ing that they not serve alcohol in the
pavilion,”’ he continued. ‘“‘Everybody
drives there, there’s no parking to
speak of and getting out is a hassle.”’

Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sutton
said some concern about the pavilion
also had been expressed to him.

“T understand from the ABC that it
was a mess, totally out of control,”
he said.

Sutton also noted that his depart-
ment does have jurisdiction over the
pavilion and the road leading to it
because Washington and Lee does
not have a separate police force.

Haywood said that Friday’s party,
which attracted 1,500 to 1,800 people,
was no different from the Homecom-
ing pavilion party. ‘‘I don’t see that
much difference between the Home-
coming crowd and this crowd,” he
added.

Both Haywood and John said the
ABC reported no problems with the
Homecoming party.

John added, though, that “my un-
derstanding is that the situation was
worse this time for a number of rea-
sons,”’ among them an increased
number of parties before the pavilion
party and a concert that lasted long-
er than the Homecoming concert.

“For us to obtain future banquet
licenses,’ Haywood said, ‘‘we’re go-
ing to have to improve on our opera-
ting methods out there.”’

Possible changes may include hir-
ing security personnel and barten-
ders rather than using student SAB
members, and changing the format
of pavilion events, he added.

‘What you may be seeing is a re-
turn toa more concert atmosphere,”’
in which seating would be provided,
rather than “ ’till 1 a.m. bashes.”

reporters Cotton Puryear and John

taxpayers want prayer,’’ stated one
woman. Kelly did not argue the fig-
ures with her, but said that it is the
responsibility of the country to pro-
tect minorities. ‘“‘In most schools,
Christians would be in the minority,”
contended another student.

One of the most well-received ar-
guments came from a Canadian stu-
dent near the close of the 45-minute
“‘heckling”’ session. ‘‘In Canada we
have the opportunity to have religi-
ous services, to have religious acts in

and it is working well.”

LeClercq closed by reiterating ar-
guments made by the negative team
during the opening statements. Lund
concluded the debate by repeating
that he was not calling for a constitu-
tional amendment, but for a less
strict interpretation of the Constitu-
tion to stop the violation of human
rights.

Although W&L’s duo lost in the
final vote, many of the Liberty Bap-
tist students approached them after-
ward with words of praise. “You
guys were brave. I was in favor of
what you said,’ exclaimed one stu-
dent. ‘‘I have to admit, I respect you
for coming here,”’ said Baity.

Ryan, LeClerecq and Kelly all
seemed fairly happy with the course
of the debate and the case presented
by the negative team.

“T thought it went well, but we
didn’t expect to change everyone’s
mind. We just wanted to present
some possible problems with prayer
in schools,” LeClercq said.

“‘T had a feeling they were going to
be courteous and polite,’ LeClercq
added. No member of the audience
booed, even after a reference to “a
President who very seldom attends
church, a clutch of loud-mouthed
television evangelists, and cynical
radical right-wing political organiza-
tions.”’

Ryan told his pair afterwards that
they should have driven home the
point that there is no structural bar-
rier blocking school prayer and
should not have debated about reli-
gious clubs and study groups when
they were not covered in the resolu-
tion. The W&L debate coach did feel
that the two handled themselves well
in what they were afraid might be a
hostile environment.

The Liberty Baptist debaters
travel to Lexington in the spring for a
similar confrontation, LeClercq and
Kelly asked the Liberty Baptist de-
baters if they might consider switch-
ing sides if the same question is de-
bated.

Also two W&L debate teams won
trophies in a regional tournament
sponsored at Ferrum College last
weekend by the national forensics
honorary society, Delta Sigma
Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha.

The junior varsity team, compris-
ed of freshman John Starks and soph-
omore Rick Graves, was awarded a
semifinalist trophy. Kelly and
LeClercq received a quarterfinalist
team trophy in the novice division.

Studying

who won the Phi Beta Kappa sopho-
more award for the highest grade
point average in his class, agrees. ‘‘If
you haven’t done anything since the
beginning of the term, you won’t do it
ina week,” he said.

At this point in the term, however,
many students find themselves face-
to-face with hundreds of pages of
reading.

“In a case like that, divide your
time well between all of your classes
or decide the best way to use your
time,” Bouffard advised.

In particular, Bouffard
recommended skimming and outlin-
ing those books that have not been
opened frequently during the term.

Elmes stressed the importance of

developing a frame of mind when
reading. ‘“‘The more you realize you
will be taking a test on the material,
the better off you will be,”’ he said.

Spatig noted a common problem,
especially among freshmen, regard-
ing time budgeting. ‘“‘Don’t sacrifice
a class you are doing well in for one
there is little hope for,”’ he said.

Quality study time, according to
Spatig, is more important than
quantity. “Everybody reaches a
point of diminishing returns,”’ he ad-
ded, and, therefore, no one should
pull all-nighters. ‘‘You need four
hours of sleep at the minimum,”

Bouffard said he also believes that
‘‘you reach a point where you are bet-
ter off sleeping than studying.”

Dividing up study time should be a
part of the ‘‘game plan,’’ Elmes
pointed out.

Regardless of a student’s game
plan, though, Bouffard said he reali-
zes that ‘‘you don’t have the time to
do everything you want . . . that is
just the way itis.”

Bouffard and Spatig both recom-
mended taking short breaks during
study time, but especially ‘‘after
each exam and before beginning the
next,’’ Spatig added.

For freshmen, Spatig said, ‘If you
really don’t know what to do, talk to
an upperclassman and ask.”’

As a student counselor, Spatig said
he believes it is most important to
‘learn from the mistakes of this term

. and don’t repeat them in the
next.”
