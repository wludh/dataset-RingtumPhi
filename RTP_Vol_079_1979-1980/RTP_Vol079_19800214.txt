Contact
Publicity
Questioned

by John Billmyre

Two Executive Committee
members gave different ap-
praisals of the Contact’s Com-
mittee’s publicity for visiting
speakers during a short EC
meeting Monday night.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole asked Contact Co-
Chairmen Scott Cardoza and
Channing Hall why they had not
put up several large posters and

announcements about Contact’s -

program.

“It’s getting pretty late in the
ballgame,’’ said Poole in
reference to the symposium’s
schedule.

Poole told the Co-Chairmen
he thought they should put up
several large schedules of Con-
tact’s speakers.

‘We put up publicity all over
town,” Cardoza said.

He also told the EC that
several speakers are not
definitely set on a date and ex-
plained he did not think it would
be a good idea to post an in-
complete schedule.

Another EC member,
Secretary Cove Geary, differed
with Poole about Contact’s
publicity.

“I think your posters have
been more than adequate,”
Geary said.

He told the Contact Co-
Chairmen, ‘‘You can’t get away
from them.”’

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould, who is also the EC
and hoc member to Contact,
told the EC Contact discussed
and rejected the idea of
scheduling several non-political
speakers.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg had suggested in an

earlier meeting the Co-
Chairmen look into getting non-
political speakers.

The Co-Chairmen announced
George McGovern will be
speaking on March 6.

Tuition and board for
Washington and Lee students
will rise next year as a result of
the expending inflation rate
that the entire nation is ex-
periencing.

Tuition will rise by $350 from
this year’s level of $3700 to
$4050, while board will climb to
$1250, a $200 increase from this
year’s price of $1050.

According to E. Stewart,
Washington and Lee’s
treasurer, the 9.5 percent in-
crease in tuition for the 1980-81
school year is the result of the
13.3 percent inflation rate cur-
rently afflicting the nation.

Because tuition is a major
source of income for the Univer-
sity, an increase is needed to
offset the costs of electricity,
labor and general maintenance
associated with the expansion
made in the past years at
Washington and Lee. Even with
the 9.5 percent increase,
however, a deficit of around
$600,000 is expected.

As a result of such a deficit,
the University must draw upon

Tuition To Rise $350

its surpluses from past years,
endowments and capital. Thus,
income that would have been
made through interest is used to
reduce the deficit.

Mr. Eply attributed the in-
crease in board as a result of
the increasing costs of food,
utilities and general
maintenance and repairs.

Of the $200 increase, $150 will
be used to pay the interest and
principle on the loan the Univer-
sity made for the construction
of the dining hall.

As a rule, though, the Univer-
sity refuses to use loans to
finance construction. In the
past, only Woods Creek apart-
ments and the apartments for
married students have been
financed by loans.

Because it is University
policy to raise housing costs
every other year, prices will re-
main the same in the 1980-81
school year for those living in
the dormitories. But those liv-
ing in Woods Creek next year
will see a 10 percent rise in
prices from this year’s cost.

Financial Condition Of |

by Ross Newell

An ad hoc advisory commit-
tee to study the financial condi-:
tion of the fraternities has been
established by W&L President
Robert E.R. Huntley, according
to an announcement by Dr.
Thomas C. Imeson to fraternity
treasurers at the _ Inter-
fraternity Council meeting
Tuesday night.

Imeson, a member of the
committee, said the purpose of
the study is to determine if the
university should change
itspolicy toward fraternities.
The school wants to know what
it can do to help fraternities

with regard to fiscal and
physical conditions, Imeson
said.

To assess the situation, the
committee needs an accurate
portrayal of each fraternity’s
current financial status. In the
past, fraternities were to have
worked with Mrs. Lowery to
prepare financialstatements at

the end of each month. —

However, Imeson said, seven
fraternities have not prepared
these statements for any month
of the year.

Only five fraternities are cur-
rent with Mrs. Lowery and at
least one has presented false in-
formation on its statement; it
listed all accounts payable as
current when, in fact, the ac-
counts were in arrears.

Imeson said it is in-
conceivable for a fraternity to
have an accounts payable
balance of zero. It would be
hard to find a fraternity that

Fraternities To Be Studied

does not owe a creditor, he said.

In an effort to assess the
financial status of the frater-
nities, each must present to the
committee a financial state-
ment current as of Dec. 31, 1979,
listing accounts payable and ac-
counts receivable.

If accounts payable has a zero
balance then the committee will
automatically hold a _ con-
fernence with the fraternity’s
treasurer. Before the con-
ference the committee will call
the common creditors of W&L
fraternities to see if the frater-
nity owed money on Dec. 31.

Imeson, who was a fraternity
treasurer while in college, said
he is well aware of the ‘‘finan-
cial wizardry” that can be in-
volved in preparing the
statements.

The investigative measures
are not punitive nor are they

dictatorial, Imeson repeated
several times during the
meeting.

“The committee must have
an accurate portrayal of the
fiscal condition of fraternities;
if we predicate a system based
on false knowlege its success
will be severely curtailed,’’ Im-
eson said.

Also, fraternities must pre-
sent the committee with an
estimate of their total expen-
ditures from Dec. 31, 1979
through Aug. 1, 1980.

The study is being conducted,
Imeson said, with the realiza-
tion that many fraternities are
in trouble regarding their

Journalist Robert Evans at SAE reception before his speech last

NUMBER 19

Journalist Assails
Soviet Invasion

by Ed Edge

The Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan could mark the
fateful corner of the beginning
of World War III, according to
former CBS Moscow Bureau
chief Robert Evans in his
speech at Washington and Lee
University’s Lee Chapel last
night.

“Ever since the revolution in
1917, the Russians have been
sensitive to the unrest within
the countries on their borders,
and they fear that any Moslem
restlessness may spread into its
population,” Evans said and
pointed out that, ‘The Soviet
Union has over 50 million
Moslems—more than any single
member state in the Arab
league.”

This Soviet fear of contagion
of unrest across its borders may
be what sparked the invasion of
Afghanistan, with the Russians
going in for what they term
‘defensive’? reasons, Evans
said, but added that there may
also be offensive reasons for the
military move.

“If the Soviets gain control of
Afghanistan, they will be able to
build airfields that will put
them within 300-350 miles from
the strait of Hormuz, where 60
percent of the free world’s oil
must pass en route to its
destination,’’ Evans said.

He pointed out that the 1'2
mile wide strait would be
susceptible to control by Soviet
tactical aircraft if the Soviets
do indeed move in and build the
airfields in Afghanistan.

“Hormuz is a geo-political
jugular that is the prime point
of Western vulnerability ; Soviet
control of the strait could hurt
us immensely,’’ Evans said.

Evans said the Russians are
getting stronger in Afghanistan
through the use of an American
innovation that arose in the
Vietnam conflict—the _heli-
copter gunship.

A single gunship can control a
valley or patrol a succession of
ridges and the tribal guerrillas

of Afghanistan cannot enjoy the
protection of a jungle canopy as
the Vietnamese did, Evans
said.

“The Soviets are effectively
keeping the Afghanis subdued
through the use of about 200
helicopter gunships and the
tribes are getting no super-
power flow of weapons to help
them knock the helicopters out
of the sky," Evans said.

The United States may even-
tually have to move forces into
Afghanistan to aid the
Afghanistan people in their
fight against the Russians; this
intervention could turn out to be
“Jimmy Carter’s Vietnam of

the 1980's,” Evans said in
speculation.

“The United States is a giant
on the world scene, a

bewildered Gulliver with its
future hobbled by a succession
of Lilliputian nations (Iran,
Afghanistan; Pakistan); it is
restrained to the point that it
cannot flex its muscles and
break the bonds,’’ Evans said.

Evans said, though, to look at
this period of time not as a time
of crisis, but one of opportunity.

Twice in the 20th century
when this country has been fac-
ed with an energy dilemma, a
revolution has arisen — in the
transition from wood to coal as
fuel, we moved into the In-
dustrial Revolution; when the
use of coal was beginning to be
replaced by the oil and
petroleum industry, a transpor-
tation revolution began,’’ he
said.

The increasing cost of oil puts
us on the threshold of a new
revolution, he said, and added
that we should pour our funds
into research that will offer us
another source of energy for the
80s.

“We in the United States
represent one-twentieth of the
world’s population, but we use
over one-third of the world’s
energy supply—we must find a
new way,’’ Evans said.

Mock Convention Report

 

Computer To Assist
Election Coverage

by Marc Birenbaum

An interesting thing occurred at the 1960 mock
convention; but, thanks to Washington and Lee in-
genuity, this year’s convention may run a bit
smoother.

Twenty years ago, candidate Adlai Stevenson
had accumulated enough votes to win that mock
convention on the fourth ballot but a shortage of
adding machines on the convention floor delayed
officials from ruling him a winner. In the interim,
several delegations switched their votes. By the
fifth ballot the Stevenson momentum had
dissipated, and the new front-runner was John F.
Kennedy.

This year, partly because of your friendly Har-
ris computer, such a delay could not happen.

The other part of that reason is that four W&L
students are building, as well as programming an
electronic scoreboard for the mock convention. As
votes are cast at the convention, one of the four—
Steve Biegler, Doug Swatski, Tom Hendricks or
Larry Wescott—will input the voting data into the
Harris system through the mock convention’s
remote terminal. After a complete ballot, prin-
touts of the breakdown of state-votings will be
available to regional coordinators and those on the
podium.

The scoreboard itself,.which wil be-hanging
from the press box in the Warner Center, will show
the totals for presidential candidates, vice
presidential candidates and yes/no votes on plat-
form issues, according to Biegler. for those who
may have a poor view of the scoreboard, five
airport-style monitors will be placed strategically
around the gym. A back-up system of two
microprocessors will be running simultaneously

with the Harris system for scoreboard operations.
The idea of using the computer for mock conven-
tion duties originated from former mock conven-

tion chairman, James MeNider. Since then, Jim

Hicks, director of computer operations has
developed programming for academic credit
under Professor Wilson, dealing mostly with ac-
counting.

A majority of that accounting deals with small
transactions, a real headache and a major factor
in past mock convention offices being cluttered
with many boxes of tally sheets and vouchers, ac-
cording to Hicks. ‘‘March and April will be when
we see how good the system is,” said Hicks. “‘I
think it’s really going to be appreciated when
things get hectic.”

The Harris system is being utilized in other
ways, according to facilities chairman, Goetz
Eaton. One function of his committee is to take
care of the convention’s telephone bills. That in-
cludes not only calls at the convention but also
those calls each chairman makes to their home
states for research purposes. The computer runs a
comparison with a telephone log sheet.

Another use of the computer will include securi-
ty. Lists of VIP’s, delegates and members of the
press are being stored as well as lists of mass
mailings. In addition, records of donations, atten-
dance and analyses of votes themselves can now
be recorded for future reference, according to
Eaton. ‘“‘The computer is very valuable to us
because all the information that was impractible
to retain last time, can now be retained,’’ said
Eaton.

“The computer really isn’t changing anything,”
said Hicks. “It’s a tool, an aid. It makes life
easier.”

 

  

Music F nae Established;

Initiates New Members

-by Rob Willis
Mu Beta Psi, a_ national
honorary music fraternity, of-
ficially re-restablished the
Washington and Lee University
chapter last week. The W&L
chapter, which was active bet-

‘ween 1965 and 1974, held a ban-

quet in December that was at-
tended by all of W&L’s Deans
and the chapter’s 32 new in-
itiates.

The president of the W&L
chapter, Eric Frey, said Mu
Beta Psi members’ would
recruit students for the various
music programs on_ the
Washington and Lee campus.
Frey also said Mu Beta Psi will
sponsor concerts on campus
and have parties for it’s
members.

The Washington and Lee
chapter is the fifth in the nation,
and will join chapters from N.C.
State, Clemson, Michigan Tech,

and St. Augustine’s College
each year at the Mu Beta Psi
National Convention, which is
being held at Clemson Universi-
ty this year. Next year the con-
vention will be held on the W&L
campus.

Eric Frey and Vice-president
Tom Lisk have been working
since the Fall of 1978 to re-
establish the Washington and
Lee chapter. They have gotten
support from Professor Robert
Stewart. (Professor Stewart
was the faculty advisor for Mu
Beta Psi at W&L when the
chapter was first established in
1965.) Frey also cited the con-
tribution which sophomore
secretary-treasurer Quinn
Peeper has made.

The 35-member fraternity
will be seeking financial sup-
port from the E.C. next year,
primarily to cover the costs of
the national convention.

Lewis Collection In duPont

Selections from the art collec-
tions of Sydney and Frances
Lewis of Richmond, will be on
exhibit in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery
starting next Monday. Gallery
hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
weekdays, and noon until 3 p.m.
on Saturdays.

A reception will take place
Tuesday, Feb. 26, from 5 to 7
p.m. in the gallery. The public
is cordially invited to attend.

More than a dozen paintings
owned by the Lewises — some
of monumental size — will be
shown in the W&L gallery. All
are from the period between
1973 and 1978, and the group in-
cludes a silkscreened canvas by
Andy Warhol of the late Golda
Meir (1975).

Sydney Lewis received his
B.A. degree from Washington
and Lee and studied law at
W&L. He has been a member of
the W&L board of trustees since
1972.

The Lewises are well-known

philanthropists whose benefac-
tions included a $9-million gift
to W&L toward consturction of
the new law building — Lewis
Hall — and to establish an en-
dowment named for Frances
Lewis to support research ‘‘at
the frontiers of the law.’’ They
have also been extremely
generous benefactors of other
colleges and of the Virginia
Museum.

In 1957, the husband-and-wife
team founded Best Products
Inc., now the nations’s largest
catalogue-showroom retail
chain. Sydney Lewis is chair-
man and chief executive of-
ficer, and Frances Lewis is ex-
ecutive vice president.

They are intensely interested
in contemporary art, especially
American works, and their col-
lections are considered to be
among the nation’s most impor-
tant.

Frances Lewis is a member
of the board of the Whitney
Museum in New York City, and

Sydney Lewis is a member of
the board of the Hirshhorn
Museum in Washington.

They have been recognized
repeatedly for their support of
the arts, and in 1978 when they
received the Thomas Jefferson
Award for Public Service in
Virginia, Gov. John Dalton,
commenting that their interest
in modern art traces back to a
time ‘‘when it was held up to
public ridicule,’ describing
them as a couple ‘‘not content to
wait”’ for an idea’s time to ar-
rive by itself.

In her response, Frances
Lewis said their ‘‘abundance of
good fortune and plain good
luck”? had given them ‘‘a suc-
cession of opportunities we
have been able to turn to our ad-
vantage — which we hope is not
entirely for ourselves.”’

There will be no admission
charge for the exhibition, which
will continue in duPont through
March 21.

Something that seems to be missed when
discussing new music these days is the era when
music was to a great extent the promoter of
human culture. Not only rock ’n roll of late, but the
twenties, forties and sixties each spawned a music
which in turn was a leader in the formation of the
sentiment of the day.

The twenties ushered in the carefree Charleston
dance and flappers, the forties and the Andrews
Sisters are analogous, and the sixties and counter-
culture movements of Woodstock and Haight-
Ashbury are all vivid examples of culture-based
music. The latter example is closer to us and thus
we cannot always be so objective about the oc-
currences, but it is clear that the advent of rock
and roll brought changes that pushed society
clearly into the ho-hum seventies. Nothing the
seventies could muster would ever be so dynamic
as the Beatles American tour or the Rolling
Stones’ rise to demagoguery.

What has happened, from my viewpoint at least,
is that the human factor has been subjugated to
the businessmen at lunch with record company ex-
ecutives. That is, that outside of the charismatic
performers of very high sales caliber, all other
acts are looked at on a coldly calculated scale of
profit vs. investment. It would take a total cretin
not to realize that the whole music industry has
grown senile and corrupt over the years, and that
truly original music has a dim future.

Not to be too pessimistic, however, I must give
credit to some premier artists like the Rolling

 

Music Predominates Our Culture

Stones, Steely Dan, Stevie Wonder and
Funkadelic, who are constantly getting better and
working to retain their status as supergroups.

There are also the commercial artists who are
facing a bit of a moral dilemma in that their
popularity will sell albums for a long while, but
they have to choose what to put on the record
itself. For example, the Eagles can continue to
play the same style of music as their debut, or lead
their audience into more progressive things. The
former is obviously the easier to do, but in reality,
how often can a band play ‘‘Take It Easy”’ and not
go tapioca?

Oh well, it seems that there will have to be a
definite consumer movement to get the industry
and the artists in question on the right track, but
maybe that’s asking for too much. Beware of the
independent record label in the eighties.

Notes: “Weird” Al Yankovic has cashed in
literally on his knack spoof ‘“‘My Bologna.”’ Capitol
Records has bought the rights for distribu-
tion...David Gates from the old ‘‘Bread’’ has a
new album out which is a real big ‘So
What?’’...“Ground Star,’’ a band from the
Washington, D.C., area was frat hopping this last
week and wowed all of the preps and rockers with
stunning Jimmy Hendrix covers and decent rock
tunes. They will be back in Lexington soon from
what I heard...Cchuck Mangione has a new
album...Todd Rundgren’s new album on
Bearsville records debuts at 26 on Billboard’s list

on all three of the major album rating charts...

More On ‘Apocalypse Now’

by Paul Hendry

It is difficult to write about a
film of which so much has been
written. All I can hope to offer
are a few quick observations
and impressions of what is
perhaps the most heralded and
talked about movie in our
lifetimes—‘‘Apocalypse Now.”’

Granted, comparatively little
has been said about
‘Apocalypse’ following its in-
itial extravagant marketing
and the first round of reviews
that accompanied its release.
This calm following the furor of
media-hype made me curious
enough to finally go out and ex-
perience this purported colossal
film achievement.

The film is consciously deriv-

ed from Conrad’s Heart of

Darkness, yet the director, Cop-
pola, uses the novel only as a
point of departure.

Martin Sheen does an ex-
cellent job in his portryal of the
film’s narrator and profoundly
disturbed protagonist.

The plot tells of his journey up
river into Cambodia during the
Viet Nam war to ‘‘terminate”’

Sheen’s Capt. Willard grap-
ples with his conscience and
large philosophical concerns as
he attempts to rationalize his

mission to assasinate the
nefarious Kurtz, played by
Brando.

The use of Conrad’s

character’s name in this in-
stance draws too much atten-
tion to the similarities in plots
and themes—an invitation for
comparison by which
‘‘Apocalypse”’ suffers.

The all-climactic encounter
between Willard and Kurtz is
far too loosely bound together
and inconclusive to act as a
significant punchline for the
long ardous journey up river.
The viewer is scarcely reward-
ed for anxiously sitting through
the lengthy film by having to

Sports

From the Pressbox
Heroes

by Bill Whalen
A popular fantasy of a sports writer is the one
where the victorious coach stands in the locker room
mements after winning the big game. The cameras

 

 

flash in on him and some reporter asks him a ques-

tion.

“Coach, where did you find the genius to stop the
Goons’ attack that way?”

‘“‘Well, Howard, as you know, we coaches spend the
entire week before a game waiting to see what the
papers say we should do. In fact, if it hadn’t been for
Joe Blah’s column in the Times. last Tuesday we
wouldn’t have stood a chance.”

Of all the columns I have done this year, only two
have given me reason to maybe think for a moment
that somebody out there reads this stuff.

The first time I got lucky was last fall, when I
predicted an “‘easy”’ way for the football team to beat
Georgetown. On that Saturday, the Generals played
the way I described and they actually won. For a few
moments, I had thought that it was my column that
had won the game, but when I didn’t get a game ball
and I had time to think it over, I knew it was only a
coincidence.

I had the same type of experience last Saturday
night, however. The W&L fans, whom I had criticized
in my last column, actually showed some spirit and
enthusiasm as the basketball team won one of the
most remarkable games I have seen in my two years
of following W&L basketball.

I know that I am not the real reason behind the good
feeling at the Warner Center.

If you’re looking for a hero, I have two candidates in
mind. Let’s give credit to the Unknown Fans. I don’t
know where you came from or how long it took you to
get here, but it certainly paid off. You helped spark
the Generals and you brought the crowd to life. If you
aren’t doing anything in the next few months, how
about returning for some lacrosse games?

But let’s also give credit to the basketball team
itself. When you’re in the midst of a losing season and
almost hopelessly behind in a game, it’s easy to give
up. But the Generals didn’t — making up eight points
in less than a minute-and-a-half.

Seeing the crowd mobbing the team after the game
will also be hard to forget for a while. It was one of
those special moments when the fans had been
rooting hard, the team had played well, and both par-
ties thanked each other.

It may also tell us something about the way basket-
ball is perceived at this school.

For some reason, the ‘‘everyone loves a winner’’
philosophy does not apply to W&L Basketball. The
crowds may have been larger when the teams would
go 22-6 or 23-5, but they did not show the feeling that
was present at Saturday night’s contest.

How that the basketball team is hovering around
the .550 mark, the fans are showing more interest and
this could be good or bad. Following the team because
they’re having a bad year is good—it shows a true in-
terest in the team and the sport in general. But follow-
ing the team because it’s fun to see them lose is
wrong—it is simply ill-conceived humor.

But what will happen next year? Will it take
another disappointing year to bring in the fans? If a
team has.to do poorly to draw a crowd, then
something is wrong.

And if you aren’t a real W&L fan after Saturday
night’s performance, then you can’t appreciate
basketball at its best.

Generals Edged 102-100

If you liked Saturday night's
overtime game _ against
Salisbury State, then you had to
love Tuesday night’s double-
overtime thriller against
Eastern Mennonite.

Leading by as many as 11
points in the second half, the
Generals were able to over-
come a three point deficit in the
27 seconds of regulation play to
send the game into overtime.
Rob Smitherman’s jumper with
two seconds left knotted the
game at 84-all.

The Generals trailed almost
the entire time in the second
overtime and found themselves
trailing 99-96 with 1:54 to play.
A Tom Jeffries jumper pulled
W&L within one and a Brian
Hanson followup put the
Generals ahead with only 1:03
to play. :

But Mennonite, led by the
play of guard Tim Crawford,

went ahead to stay when.

Crawford hit two of his game-
high 33 points with 0:53 left in
the game. Travis Sanders then
hit the front end of a one-and-
one free-throw opportunity to
put Mennonite ahead 102-100.
The Generals were unable to
connect on any of three shots in
the last 13 seconds, and the
game ended at the end of the se-
cond overtime, 102-100.

Oftensively, the Generals
played one of their finest games
of the season. Smitherman led
W&L with 23 points. “String”
was followed by Jeffries and
Hanson, who each tallied 18
points. Guards George Spears
and Clark New each had 13
points, while forward Travis
Patterson added 12 more.

From the way the second half
Started, it seemed as though
everyone at tht Warner Center
could have called it an early
evening. Two baskets each by
Patterson and Jeffries gave the
Generals a 57-47 lead with 14:57
to go.

Hanson then ripped off eight
points in a five minute span to
boost W&L to a seemingly in-
surmountable 74-63 lead with
only 6:29 to play.

Mennonite scored five
straight points to cut the lead to
only five. But in the last six
minutes of regulation play, the
Generals could muster only six
points. Meanwhile, Mennonite
was outscoring W&L, 20-6, to go
ahead 83-80 with only twenty
seconds left to play.

Clark New took the ensuing
inbounds pass and raced the
length of the court, hitting a 20-
foot jumper with only 21
seconds left to cut the deficit to

In Twin-Overtime Drama

one point. Pollard was then foul-
ed with 16 seconds lef but could
connect on only one of two free
throws.

The Generals then took the
ball past mid-court and called a
time-out to set up the last shot.
Smitherman’s. ten-foot jumper
from the left side evened the
score with only two ticks left on
the clock. Mennonite got off a
final shot, and a fifty-foot at-
tempt by Crawford came un-
comfortably close, hitting the
backiron.

Smitherman again appeared
to be the man-of-the-hour as his
lay-up gave the Generals an
88-86 lead with 1:35 to go in the
first O.T. Hanson then made a
lay-up to give W&L a 90-88 lead
with 36 seconds left, but
Crawford jumper with 21
seconds left sent the game into
a sceond overtime.

Actually, it appeared as
though neither team wanted to
win. Mennonite seemingly had
the game in control, holding a
three-point lead with less than
two minutes to go. Yet the
Generals had another chance at
pulling the game out. Clark
New missed fron underneath in
the closing seconds and seemed
to have been fouled, but no call
was made.

Grapplers Close Out Regular Season

by Chris Sisto

The varsity wrestling team
had a very uneventful week
recently as they had no dual
meets and did not appear in any
tournaments. Their one
scheduled dual meet against
Longwood College was cancell-
ed. This gives the team some
time to prepare fer the busy
week-and-a-half coming up.

The Generals will have three
dual meets this week. Then dur-
ing February Break, the team

will travel to Hampden-Sydney
for the ODAC Championships to
be held on Feb. 19.

The Generals can even their
dual meet record and finish the
season at 5-5 if they win all
three meets this week. Head
Coach Gary Franke is
somewhat skeptical, refusing to
make that long of a forecast.

He did say that the team’s
first opponent this week, James
Madison University, will be one
of the toughest teams that his

also said that at the moment,
the last team the Generals will
fact this week, George
Washington, has an advantage
due to several additions of
young wrestlers into the
Generals’ lineup.

In between these two mat-
ches, the Generals will also face
Davidson College.

As for the ODAC Champion-
ships, a tournament the
Generals have never lost, the
team will have its work cut out
this time around. They beat
Hampden-Sydney earlier in the
season but have also lost to Lyn-
chburg — the team that looks to
be the tournament favorite.

The only other wrestling news
of note after the ODAC Tourna-
ment is the NCAA Division III

Feb. 22-23. Wrestlers are chosen
through their performances

Lax Team Off To Bermuda

by Kip Gordon
With their season opener just
three weeks away, the lacrosse
Generals have begun final
preparations for the start of the
1980 season.

About sixty players reported
to Spring practice, which began
a week from last Monday.
Because of this large number,
practice time has been devoted
mainly to evaluation of talent so
that the varsity roster can be
completed by the winter break,
said Coach Jack Emmer.

Emmer intends to keep
thirty-two players at the varsity
level, and it is this squad which
will be taken to Bermuda for
practice over the Washington
Holiday break.

Virginia weather has been
less than suitable for outdoor
practices and the Bermuda
climate should provide a
welcome change in practice
field conditions. Emmer hopes
to get in around twelve
workouts, and thus expects the
trip to be a productive one.

The return of 6’8”’ attachman
Chris Kearney to the lacrosse
team has raised a_ few
eyebrows. Kearney, who led the
Generals in scoring his
sophomore year, has been away
from the game for two years,
having taken a year off from
lacrosse and spending another
away from school.

Said Emmer, ‘‘He’s a little
rusty after the two years off and

there are a number of other
talented attackmen, so it’s still
too early to tell how much he’ll
be able to help the team.

The Generals will first
display their talents in a two
day scrimmage with Bucknell
over Fancy Dress weekend, one
week after the Bermuda trip.
The following week they open
the season with a game against
Mt. Washington, a club team.

Just one week later the
Generals will face Syracuse, a
team which placed sixth in last

. year’s NCAA playoffs.

With the Syracuse game still
one month away, Emmer
believes his team will be ready.

| Apocalypse Reviewed

(continued from page 3)
watch a vague climax that suc-
ceeds only in making a long
movie longer.

If’ there is one thing
‘“‘Apocalypse”’ is, it is visually
compelling. The film is loaded
with exciting and powerful im-
ages. Coppola is very successful
in creating a bizarre nightmare
of war.

The difficulty for the viewer
is that the dreamlike quality—a
quality enhanced through the
photography, narration, and
Coppola-composed score—acts
as a barrier to entering the
world of the film.

It is all too easy to sit and
mumble ‘‘Weird.’’ The
Playboy-U.S.0. show scene
struck me as a particularly
strange and nightmarish in-
terlude.

Robert Duvall’s moments are
some of the finest in the film in

his Col. Kilgore role. The entire
Kilgore sequence from start to
finish is perhaps the finest in
the. film and the best
demonstration of Copola’s
power asia director.

Kilgore’s name makes one
mindful of Kubrick’s ‘‘Dr.
Strangelove,’’ and similarities
in the black comedy. and
nightmarish mood are overtly
recognizable in the two.
Kilgore, in one secen, a surfing
buff, makes a strategic decision
on the basis of the good waves
at one target — some of his men
surf during an attack.

‘‘Apocalypse’’ may be an in-
tellectual experience for some,
for others it may be a
memorable spectacle. Others
still may find its. esoteric quali-
ty difficult to digest and look
forward to catching “Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid”’
for the hundredth time.

Swimming Program On Rise

by Frank Jackman

What ever happened to the
W&L swim team?

There is a distinct possibility
that the team will finish no bet-
ter than 1-10 this year after hav-
ing only a 2-8 record last year. It
was not too long ago that the
Generals were considered one
of the best teams in the state.

Well, first year Coach Page
Remillard says that the student
body can expect the team to be
back at that high competitive
level in the very near future.

The team is in the midst of a
rebuilding year and, if all goes
according to plan, the swimm-
ing Generals should be at, or
above, the .500 level by next
season.

One of the greatest problems
faced by Remillard and his
team this year is. lack of
numbers. The average swim
team has 16-20 members. The
W&L team has only ten
members, eight swimmers and
two divers. It’s hard to compete
with such a small team.

To solve this problem, a full
scale recruiting program has
been initiated — something that
was not emphasized enough
before. And the recruiting has
paid off. Coach Remillard ex-
pects 10 to 12 new faces next
year. These should help the
team immensely.

Beside recruiting, an em-

phasis has also been placed on .

the development of a good pro-

gram for those swimmers
already here. With such a foun-
dation laid, the results are bet-
ter recruiting and a more com-
petitive team.

There is no doubt that the
team has worked hard to start

. that foundation. It practices

every morning at 6:30 for an
hour and a half, and every
afternoon for two more hours.
In addition to swimming, team
members also lift weights for
three hours a week.

Remillard sees a growing
trend toward swimming as an
intercollegiate sport in this part
of the country. In his opinion,
the W&L team has the potential
to be one of the more powerful
teams in this growing sport.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Small Bands...

If you were in the Cockpit Tuesday night you
already know that our tavern was host to another
“Small Band.” We refer, of course, to Jamie Small
and his University Center Committee which has con-
sistently placed top quality entertainment in the
Cockpit all year. But perhaps a brief history lesson
will put this in the proper perspective.

Three years ago, there were many more VMI
Keydets than W&L students in the Cockpit on most
nights. Then something called the Music Union was
born with the mission of bringing ‘‘bar music’”’ (as it
is called in some circles) to the tavern in an effort to
draw students back. The plan worked and has been
continued ever since.

Burr Datz, a W&L graduate and former Cockpit
employee, used his connections in the music world to
upgrade the quality of entertainment last year. Witha
little help from Datz, Small and company has in-
herited the chore and has done and exceptional job of
bringing high-grade live entertainment to the Cockpit
ona limited budget.

Tim Eyermann and East Coast Offering was the
latest in Smali’s series of successes. His committee
has often packed the Cockpit to capacity—to the ad-
vantage of both the management and the student
body. Maybe you thought bands just appear in the
W&L tavern? No, it takes the work of at least a few
students willing to go through the endless hassles of
dealing with agents and managers to get the sort of
entertainment Small and company has been pro-
viding us regularly in the comfortable atmosphere of
the Cockpit.

,.And Belated Thanks

A few weeks ago your student government did an
amazing thing: it lowered the price of your Fancy
Dress ticket—from $20 to $15.

The price reduction was the result of that sort of
diligent job the EC has done all year. EC members
added some figures together and found that the Stu-
dent Activities Board would make a $10,000 profit on
the dance at $20 a head. Some hard questions got $5 off
the ticket price.

We're glad to see the EC holding the line against in-
flation by keeping the price of Fancy Dress
reasonable.

Theft

Dear Editor,

In response to the Phi’s arti-
cle on stealing, I would like to
relate a recent experience of
mine.

About two weeks ago, I left
my watch in the gymnasium
weight room following a
workout. I noticed it was miss-
ing after a couple of hours and I
returned to recover it.

Lo and behold it was gone
(this didn’t shock me too much
since I had permanently “‘lost”’
two watches, a pair of running
shoes, and several other items
there on previous occasions).

I made the usual checks with
the equipment room, where lost
articles are collected with the
usual negative results. Anyway,
suffice it to say that I more or
less forgot about the loss.

However, the day before
yesterday, I recovered my
watch under unusual cir-
cumstances. I walked into the
weight room and spotted my
watch lying ona gym mat.

 

 

 

 

 

NU

“HEY. WHERE'S MY

BIOLOGY EXPERIMENT?”

 
   

 

 

I scooped it up and started to
put it on, but I quickly recon-
sidered and put it back down on
the mat and waited for the thief
to pick it up.

You can imagine my shock
when a faculty member picked
the watch up and started to
walk away with it. I confronted
him with the statement, ‘‘Hey, I

think that’s my watch,”’ to

which he responded, ‘‘Oh, is it?

I’ve had this for two weeks.”’

He gave me the watch and
walked away without any ex-
planation. I didn’t pursue the
subject with him nor do I plan
to.

Perhaps, though, I should
have taken a good look at his

shoes and asked him what pawn
shop he frequents.

Response To Carmichael Letter

Dear Editor,

I can tolerate ignorance; I can _ tolerate
ethnocentricism, I can even tolerate juvenile
behavior in an upperclassman, but J will not
tolerate an outright lie!

I sincerely hope that the majority of the W&L
community will not be misled by the inaccurate
statements of one misinformed young student!

The Student Association for Black Unity is ad-
vised by me and I approved of their choice to bring
Brother Kwame Toure to W&L. Bringing Brother
Toure here was intended to bring a new and dif-
ferent point of view to the W&L campus. Granted,
you may not agree with this position, but be adult
enough to attempt censorship of ideas you don’t
like ! Fortunately truth is independent of personal
Opinion.

David Mullin’s ‘‘lie’’ (Isn’t lying an honor viola-
tion!) hopefully won’t create a hostile environ-
ment between black and white students here.
Since David didn’t bother to check the accuracy of
his statements before he ran off at the mouth, I
would like to clarify the chief inaccuracy for the
record. Brother Toure, unlike Mr. Mullin, is a man
of principle, he came here for a small honorarium

Persi flage

and travel expenses. Kwame Toure was not paid
the enormous figure cited by Mr. Mullin. It is an
out-right lie ‘‘created’’ by Mr. Mullin that should
be apologized for publicly. The damaging conse-
quences for such irresponsibility should no go un-
punished! In his anxiety to get his “criticism’””’ off
his chest, Mr. Mullin could have created a situa-
tion imperiling the tranquility of the campus com-
munity.

In the charter of the Student Association for
Black Unity is the purpose of disseminating black
culture throughout the W&L community. The pro-
grams of SABU will not be dictated to by those
who want to bury their heads in the sand and go
back to the days when ‘‘negrohood’’ was in flower.
If that is allowed to happen, we will all lost
something valuable at W&L.

In the next few months SABU will sponsor black
speakers in business, the arts, and politics. Next
time David, rather than speculate and irrespon-
sibly criticize, why not come and simply par-
ticipate. Remember one thing, the ‘‘failure of a
revolutionary” said was “‘participation gives one
the right of observation!”’

John L. White
Director of Minority Affairs

Giving The Fancy Dress Bid

Obviously, you’re not worried about it now. I
mean, who could worry about such a thing the day
before vacation starts?

But let’s face it, deep down there’s that gnawing
doubt. Who the hell can you ask to Fancy Dress?

The key to the situation is remaining calm. Sure,
you don’t want a date who might be mistaken for
the Mock Convention’s logo, but that’s no reason to
jump after the first piece of candy coated fluff you
can find.

Those worshippers of plastic daddy don’t come
cheap, and they end up spending most of their
time in the bathroom with their girlfriends,
anyway. It’s like dating a mannikin that eats.

No, to get a really superior date for this night of
appearances and artificiality, you must realize
how coveted a prize is the golden bird.

To be able to tell her friends that she attended

one of the premier college social events of the
year, a normally discriminating debutante will
hop off her pedestal and grovel in the meat market
with everyone else. It is up to you to attend and
participate in the upcoming cattle shows if you ex-
pect to cut an acceptable heifer out of the herd.

But again, you must be patient. You won’t get a
good return on your investment if you panic and
surrender the bid without negotiations.

Perhaps she will be willing to experience a form
of intellectual inter-action with you. Maybe she’ll
agree to participate in a meaningful dialogue con-
cerning the creation of various life forms. Or, bet-
=e maybe she'll fix you dinner and make your

ed.

Whatever, you should remember that you are
not using coercion to achieve your ends. It’s only
because the carrot is so desired that rabbits take
the bait.
More Letters To The Editor
Student Calls For New IFC Charter

To the Editor:

I would like to express my appreciation to Syd
Farrar for responding to my letter which ap-
peared in the February 1 edition of the Phi. I
would also like to express my regret that Mr. Far-
rar did not choose to address the specific questions
that I raised. Well, let’s let bygones be bygones.
However, since we seem to have a public forum
going on here, I would like to focus on the fraterni-
ty problem as a whole, and then, offer a solution.

The fraternity problem is quite large and multi-
faceted. Therefore, I arbitrarily choose to begin
outlining this problem from the faculty point of
view. During my years here, there has been an in-
creasing effort on the part of the faculty and the
administration to interfere with the government
process of the fraternity system. There are some
who will abuse that. The faculty is most often
heard from through a vocal minority. However,
since I have not heard a dissenting view contrary
to that vocal segment, I assume the faculty is fair-
ly well-unified in its position. The administration
and faculty have tried to regulate social practices
ranging from party hours to housekeeping. As
well, those two bodies have expressed dismay at
the lack of constructive attitudes, goals and values
that seem to be rampant throughout the fraternity
system. I think it is fair to say, perhaps
simplistically, that the faculty feels impelled to in-
tervene because it does not think the fraternity
system is governing itself properly.

Also, during my years here, there has been in-
creasing rejection and resentment on the part of
the students toward any attempt by the faculty or
administration to interfere with the government of
the fraternity system. The students have made
some cosmetic concessions in the partying
schedule and there seems to be some improve-
ment in the appearances of the houses. However,
there has been no attempt by the students, as a
unit, to cure the real disease—the lack of construc-
tive attitudes, goals and values.

It is now necessary to focus on the mediator bet-
ween the faculty and the students— the fraternity
government, the Interfraternity Council. The IFC
has become the fulcrum of the community seesaw.
On one end of the board is an emotional faculty
calling for more control. On the other end of the
board is an emotional body of students rabidly op-
posed to faculty intervention. From my appraisal
of the situation, it is clear that the IFC is not satis-
fying either side of the controversy. To put it quite
clearly, the government of the fraternity system is
not governing. Why?

To answer question, ‘‘Why is the IFC not govern-
ing?’’, we must examine the Constitution of the
fraternity system and, keeping the word “‘govern’’
in mind, ascertain if that document is capable of
fulfilling the definition of that word in a manner
that is congruent to our needs today. So let’s take a
look at the Constitution. (See page 24 of the Stu-
dent Handbook. )

First, to govern anything, by definition, it is
necessary to set a goal, ideal or standard to
regulate and control by. Take a good look at the

preamble, that part which sets the tone for the
document. It reads as if it were a peace treaty bet-
ween warring tribes. It celarly does not set a stan-
dard, goal, or an ideal that is sufficient to fulfill
our needs of today. The rest of the constitution is
conspicuously void of any standards, goals or
ideals for the fraternities or the members to live
by. In fact, the only requirement that I can find is
that fraternity members conduct themselves as

Hanging

Dear Editor,

gentlemen during rush. (By-law 6, section 6a) No
doubt, gentlemanliness is an admirable quality,
but to survive in the future we face, we will have to
be considerably more than gentlemen. (And many
would argue that this one goal has yet to be realiz-
ed.)

In essence, the constitution merely defines the
powers of individual officers. How can these of-
ficers execute their powers if they don’t have a
relevant goal, ideal, or standard to lead them? I
believe there are few people in the fraternity com-
munity who, after reading the constitution, will
disagree with my assertion that the present
charter is insufficient for the purpose of governing
ourselves today.

Obviously, I am calling for the abolition of the
present constitution and the creation and ratifica-
tion of a new one. I am not suggesting the abolition
of the fraternity system. I am trying to strengthen
it. 1am fully aware of the magnitude of such a re-
quest and I do not suggest it lightly. So I shall pro-
ceed.

Before I get into the creation of a new constitu-
tion, allow me to make one qualifying statement.
Any new constitution should be conceived and
written entirely by students and without any input
from the faculty or administration. If we are not
capable of governing ourselves in a manner that is
constructive and beneficial to the society we live
in then we should not be here in the first place.

I would like to outline the general concept by
which I believe a new constitution should be
created. Any new constitution should set up a
fraternity system that is beneficial to our society
as a whole. To do this, we must look at the world
around us—the world which we must soon become
a part of.

Considering the many crises. we face now, and
the ever-growing complexity of the problems that
are bound to arise in the future, it is clear that the
next 30 years will present the toughest test of sur-
vival that our nation has ever had to endure. Since
it is our generation that will have to pass that test,
it is time to assess the qualities we will need to suc-
ceed.

The most important quality we will need, in a
general sense, is the ability to communicate with
other people in order to be able to grasp and to
understand their thoughts and ideas. We will then
have to be able to communicate our ideas and
thoughts so that other people can grasp and
understand them as well. To achieve this quality
we must possess the powers of analytical reason-
ing, and the mastery of the skills of writing and
oratorical rhetoric.

Therefore, any fraternity system should be con-
ducive to dispersion of thought and the goal of ac-
quiring and refining the skills of writing and
oratorical rhetoric. This is not to say that the new
system will force people to become involved in
areas that they might not wish to delve into. It is to
say that the new fraternity system will support
and encourage those who wish to attain those
goals.

I welcome any cirticism of the preceding
paragraph on the basis of merit. However, I can
sympathize with the people who will not suggest
that it is impossible to create a fraternity system
that could fulfill these goals. I ask you to wait until
the next issue when I will present the framework
of a new constitution that will outline how it will be
done. Meanwhile, read the present IFC constitu-
tion and think positively!

Thank you,

Notice

Because of mid-winter break
the next issue of the Ring-tum
Phi will be published Feb. 28.

How much longer must we en-
dure the irresponsible sports
commentaries from Mr.
Whalen? His latest attempt at
an analysis of the Super Bowl
was completely unfounded and
is an insult to the intelligence of
any semi-informed football fan.

Does Mr. Whalen possess
some prophetic ability which
enables him to pronounce that
the Rams will never be the best
team in pro football? Maybe he
can tell me what’s going to be
on my accounting final too. How
can Mr. Whalen refer to a con-
sistently winning team as ‘‘a

Furthermore, if he had ever
seen the Rams play, which I’m
sure he hasn’t, he would know
better than to compare them to
a, ‘“‘semi-comatose houndog.”’

I think anyone who saw the
Super Bowl observed a Ram
team playing with a great deal
of emotion, as they did for 18
consecutive weeks.

And finally, I watched the en-
tire game, maybe Mr. Whalen
missed it, and I failed to
observe any ‘“‘laughter’’ from
the Steelers during the contest.

Granted, Mr. Whalen certain-
ly has the right to an opinion,

Decisions About Energy

Dear Editor:

Washington and Lee is known
for producing men who will
recognize and overcome the
pressing problems. that
America faces, but presently I
see Washington and Lee
students flinching in the face of
these problems and running to
their secure little worlds which
they meticulously create.

How many times must our
present leaders announce the
monumental importance of the
energy issue before it is fully
addressed by the leaders of
tomorrow?

If one would give it some
thought, he would come to

realize that the means of con-
suming energy is a fundamen-
tal aspect of any society.

America, in the near future,
has to make some profound
decisions concerning the energy
issue and it is the responsibility
of all educated people to
become thoroughly
knowledgeable about this issue
and to voice their opinion.

I sincerely hope that
Washington and Lee students
will accept their responsibility
and take advantage of organiza-
tions such as S.T.A.N.D. in
order to meet the challenge.

Expression or Pollution?

Dear Editor,

Recently three W&L students
felt the necessity to pollute our
campus grounds with their per-
sonal political views. I suggest
that if every member of our
community chose this method
of expression, our campus
would be cheapened and lit-
tered. I personally have acted
to curtail the placing of ex-
cessive amounts of posters by
legitimate organizations which
I am involved.

If these ‘‘gentlemen”’ felt the
need to offend General West-
moreland, there are two other
more conventional and socially
acceptable means. They could
have passed out literature at
the entrance of Lee Chapel on
the evening of the general’s
speech. Or, alternatively, they
could have questioned the
general’s positions directly.

Yes, I personally found it of-
fensive that these students
cowardly posted a_ position
without identifying themselves

Dear Sir:

The Kinniburg description of
Bob Crosby’s musicmasters
who will play at Fancy Dress
was well-written and quite com-
plete — save for one interesting
detail that he may not know
about.

During the late '30s, Crosby's
Bobcats did more than anyone
to bring to national attention the
Washington and Lee Swing. I
remember this clearly, and I
still own a scratched but belov-
ed and highly melodic 78 r.p.m.

Call For More Freedom Of The Press

Dear Editor:

In response to IFC President
Syd Farrar’s questioning of the
allegations castigating his in-
volvement in several student
government committees.

I would like to commend and
hope that he will continue his ef-

forts to clear up the
misunderstandings that the
university community

sometimes entertains concern-
ing incidents such as the Fiji-
Pika altercation.

During the course of the cur-
rent school year, many in-
cidents have reduced the cam-
‘pus to a state of rumor because
of incomplete or inaccurate ac-
counts of controversial events.

This problem can be relieved
in many instances by the
governmental agency which
has jurisdiction over an issue.

In fact this problem primarily
exists because of the failure of
certain agencies to give a com-
plete and accurate account of
what actions they have taken
and THE REASONING FOR
WHICH THOSE ACTIONS ARE
DEEMED NECESSARY.

It is folly to criticize the
university community for opi-
nions which were derived from
the only sources of information
available to them.

Student government agencies
must be and are accountable to

the students which they repre-
sent. Therefore it is not un-
justified but necessary for stu-
dent journalists to inquire about
an apparent voting shift by a
representative of the students
and fraternities.

Moreover it is the duty of stu-
dent representatives to explain

the ‘‘facts or feelings surroun-
ding”’ particular votes.

Only then will the university
community be free of rumor
and controversey. Only then
will student government be just
and accountable.

Hangings Controversy Cont.

Dear Editor:

With regard to the “W&L
Hanging Controversy.” I want
to start off by saying that I think
it is unfair that just because Ms.
Gretchen C.F. Shappert, Esq. is
in the minority as a woman here-
at W&L, her article should be so
rudely placed on page 16 of the
Phi. I think she should have
been granted a full spread (with
picutres of the annual debu-
tante ball, etc.) on the front
page.

I do share her opinion about
the harsh, evil, vile, abusive
obscenity in the ‘‘infamous”’
sticker. It makes me sick to my
sensitive stomach.

I also plead with the supply
store to remove the sticker that
boldly asserts ‘‘Washington and
Lee IS THE University of
Virginia.”’ This is abusive and
violently demeaning to the
other Virginia college students,
who suffer an even more debas-

W&L Moot Court Team
Among Nation’s Best

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s moot court—legal debate
—team emerged as one of the
eight best in the nation in com-
petition in New York City
recently.

The W&L law school
representatives—William J.
Milani of Tappan, N.Y.,
Buckner P. Wellford of Mem-
phis and Kerry M. Wilson of
Lexington, all second-year
students—reached the quarter-
finals in the national contest by

defeating teams from the
University of Washington and
‘Vanderbilt University.

The W&L team qualified for
the national meet after winning
first place in a_ preliminary
four-state competition in
November.

In the quarterfinals, W&L’s
team was defeated by a team
from Boston University’s law
‘school.

About 250 teams representing

_ more than 160 law schools in the
nation participated in the moot
court competition in its initial
stages.

The debate this year centered
on the question of civil lawsuits
in instances where the facts of a
case are so complex that a jury

cannot be expected to unders-
tand them. Each team was re-
quired to argue both sides of the
question.

Samuel W. Calhoun, assistant
professor of law, was advisor to
the W&L team, and a third-year
student, Llewellyn Hedgbeth,
was student advisor and coach.

| Study Of Frat Finances|

(continued from page 1)
physical facilities with few, if
any, being maintained well
enough to last into the future.

J. Holt Merchant, IFC faculty
advisor, said if the university
waits any longer to take some
type of action then a house or
two will be lost to financial
hardship.

Imeson said the committee is
looking to see what alternatives
the university has to help
fraternities. Nothing will be
forced on fraternities, and any
programs implemented as a
result of the committee’s fin-
dings will be conducted on a
voluntary basis, he said.

Possible outcomes of the
study might be joint efforts bet-
ween fraternities and
university in such areas as
maintenance and food service.
Also, the committee’s findings
will be used to assess the
school’s fraternity loan pro-
gram.

Maintenance, for example,
might be provided by university
personel to fraternites for a
charge, Imeson said. The ser-
vices would cost the school
more than thefraternities would
be charged, he added.

After many treasurers ques-
tioned the committee’s motives,

the:

Imeson said if a_ traternity
perceives this action as a threat
then it is experiencing the latter
stages of paranoia. The com-
mittee is attempting to help
fraternities and to discover
what else the university can do
to help, he said.

In other business, IFC
presidentSyd Farrar said-
fraternity checklists are due on
Feb. 26. Spot inspections are
scheduled for the 27th. :

Greg McDonald, spokesman
of the Students for Community
Action group, said the organiza-
tion, in conjunction with a
federally funded group, Total
Action Against Poverty, needs
fraternity members _ topar-
ticipate in community service
projects arranged by TAP.

The work, to be done on Satur-
days, would include _ both
manual and _ skilled labor,
everything from shovelling
snow to doing carpentry work
and laying bricks. Fraternities
interested in participating can
leave word at the office in the
Student Center or contact
McDonald at 463-4916.

The IFC’s next meeting will
be the Tuesday after Fancy
Dress. The floor will be open to
nominations for IFC president
and vice-president at the
meeting.

EC Conducts Business

(continued from page 1)

The Calyx also reported to the
EC Monday night.

The Yearbook’s business
manager told the EC Studio
Costs were going to run higher

_ than allocated for in the budget.

Hamilton explained the Calyx
ran into additional expenses by
offering resale of pictures to
seniors.

Another expense, _ said
Hamilton, was the purchase of
equipment for color processing.

‘“‘We bought the equipment to
do our own color work,’’ said
Hamilton.

He said the Publications
Board also paid for the color
equipment.

In response to questions from
Poole, Hamilton told the EC
revenue will be coming in dur-

‘ing the next few months from

fraternities, advertising and the
University.

Hamilton said he expects to
collect $3,000 from fraternities
for house pictures.

The business manager added
money from the University will
not be collected before the year-
book is published, because the
library buys excess copies of
the Calyx.

Asked about the overall finan-
cial picture, Hamilton said the
Calyx should come out close to
budget.

Jim Vines, Chairman of the
Cold Check Committee,
reported to the EC that the CCC

-needs a law school represen-

tative.

“Law School attendance is
down now,” said Vines. He told
the EC that law students do not
show up as frequently when
there is no law representative.

Vines said he is going to put
posters up around the law
school to find a new law school
representative.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser suggested the Cold
Check Committee might save
money and create better public
relations if it wrote its own let-
ters to persons with long-term
cold check violations.

These violations are usually
from students who have left the
university earlier. in the year,
said Vines.

Recently the CCC has relied
on the school’s lawyer to notify
the long-term violators.

“The lawyer gets better
results than the Committee,”

_ said Vines.

Vines told the EC last month
was Slow for the CCC, but added
next month should be busy
because of Fancy Dress.

The EC unanimously voted
that the University Atheletic
Committee investigate the
reservation system for racquet-
ball courts.
