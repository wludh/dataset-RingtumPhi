How The Rally Was Reported

by David Greer

The Associated Press
reported in a news summary
yesterday ‘“‘a crowd of scream-
ing anti-Iranian demonstrators
in Lexington last night tried to
take over a radio station on the
campus of Washington and Lee
before it dispersed.”’

A later report said that a
crowd of about 50 ‘‘went to the
school radio station, WLUR”
and left after it was read a
report on the demonstration.

Despite the way it appears,
the WLUR staff did not have to
contend with two groups of peo-
ple in their facilities. Each of
the above reports describes the
same event.

Many students were amazed
to read that they had been part
of a ‘‘screaming, torch-bearing
mob as hundreds marched
through city streets.’’ Ac-

“The AP reports called it an

wrong. It started with a group
of people concerned about Iran.
I don’t think there was potential
for damage or violence,”
Dashiell said.

EC Takes Firm Stand
Qn Security

by Joe Scott

An Executive Committee
report studying the security
problem at Washington and Lee
suggests that persons acting
suspiciously who are not con-
nected with the University be
arrested for trespassing.

The subcommittee report was
approved at the Dec. 3 EC
meeting, Monday night.

“All in all, the report was a
good report, especially the law
section,’’ said
Sophomore EC Rep. Jim
Wenke. (The report is reprinted
in its entirety at the end of this
story. )

“It is a very broad topic,”
said Junior EC Rep. Bruce
Poole. ‘‘The real sore spot was
the no trespassing policy. What
it comes down to,” he added,
“is that any time you have a law
to enforce, it is up to the discre-
tion of those who enforce it. You
can carry any law to the ex-
treme.”’

“T just wanted to say that the
wording could have been bet-
ter,’”’ said first-year Law Rep.
Sam Allen. He was referring to
the deleted word ‘‘juveniles’’
which was replaced by “any
member not involved or con-
nected with the W&L communi-

ty.” Allen added that it could
create problems between the
town and the University.

“Students aren’t taken very

seriously in this town,” said
Ring-tum Phi Editor Randy
Smith. ‘“My own opinion is that
the Commonwealth’s Attorney
and police should vigorously
prosecute vandals.”’

Anti-lranian Rally
Marches On Lex

by Dick Moss

What began as a peaceful, if
somewhat rowdy, anti-Iranian
rally of about 400 Washington
and Lee students in the Law
School field last Tuesday night
ended in a mob march on Lex-
ington and the Virginia Military
Institute.

The flag-waving, torch-
bearing, banner-swinging
crowd repeatedly sang patriotic
songs amidst chants such as
“‘Nuke ‘em till they glow’, “‘It
worked in Japan, do it in Iran”
and ‘‘Test the Neutron bomb.”’

The mob wound its way from
the law school field to Main
Street in Lexington, where it
then moved to the police station
behind the R.E. Lee Hotel to
rescue one of its brethren who
had been picked up by police.
They then marched on the
Virginia Military Institute, and
returned to the Washington and
Lee campus after about an
hour.

It all began with an anti-
Iranian rally on the Law School
field, where the Ayatollah Kho-
meini was burned in effigy
three times. A speech was also
given on the field by freshman
Jim Gerrard which was pretty
well drowned out by the crowd.

 

The rally was organized by
Gerrard and a_ group of
freshmen students here at
Washington and Lee, to ‘‘show
that we aren’t going to stand for
letting anybody push this coun-

try around.”
After the crowd tired of this,
shouts of ‘‘March on Lex-

ington!”’ rang through the air.
The organizers of the rally had
not planned on this occurrence.

The mob then marched up
past the gym and down
Washington Street, singing and
disrupting traffic, until they ar-
rived at Main Street, where
they turned south. At the in-
tersection of Washington and
Main streets, two Lexington
policemen attempted to stop the
demonstrators, with little suc-
cess.

As the crowd began to near
the intersection- of Main and
Preston streets, another patrol
car stopped, and picked up one
of the demonstrators, Steve
Johnson, a W&L student, for
carrying a torch on the street,
and he was taken to the Lex-
ington Police Station.

The mob followed them there,
and stood outside of the station
chanting ‘‘Free the hostage!”

Johnson was released after

The awarding of tenure ap-
pointments, an accepted faculty
hiring practice here at
Washington and Lee, affords
tenured instructors a _ large
degree of job security; this
same practice can also make
the jobs and careers of
untenured instructors very in-
secure.

“I will be on the job market
this year,”’ relates Assistant
English Professor Carren
Kaston. Like two of her English
Department colleagues, Assis-
tant Professors Robert Fure
and John Swift, Kaston ac-
cepted her first-term appoint-
ment with the understanding

 

English Department’s Tenure Dilemma

that she would probably not
receive tenure.

The English Department’s
dilemma stems from what John
Swift calls the Department’s
decision ‘‘not to be tenured up.”’
Most of the instructors in the
English Department have
tenure, including Associate
Dean of Students Robert
Huntley and Associate Dean of
the College Edwin Craun, who
temporarily left their teaching
duties to assume ad-
ministrative positions. These
instructors plan to return to
their teaching positions even-
tually and the English Depart-
ment cannot confer tenure upon
any of the instructors presently

occupying those vacancies.

There is presently no pros-
pect for any instructor in the
English Department who has
not already received tenure to
obtain a tenure appointment.
Rather than contract any or all
of these three instructors for an
additional term appointment
that may extend their careers
at Washington and Lee beyond
seven years, at which time
tenure is automatically confer-
red, these instructors must be
discharged.

English Department Head
Dr. Sidney Coulling explains
that shrinking enrollments in
upper level English courses and

Mock Convention Report

Alumni
Accept
Convention
Invitations

Two alumni of Washington
and Lee University who are now
prominent in Republican party
politics — William Brock III,
national GOP chairman, and
U.S. Sen. John W. Warner of
Virginia — have accepted in-
vitations to take part in the
W&L student body’s 17th Mock
Convention next May.

Brock, a 1953 W&L graduate
and former U.S. Senator from
Tennessee, will deliver the
Mock Convention’s opening ad-
dress, and Warner, a 1949
engineering graduate, will be
parade marshall.

The Mock Convention will
take place May 9 and 10.

GOP Chairman
Brock

Brock has been national party
chairman for two years and is
credited with impressive suc-
cess in rebuilding the party’s
grass-roots strength. His open-
ing address May 9, defining the
Republican National Commit-
tee’s view of the 1980 Presiden-
tial race, ‘‘will be the capstone
to our three years of prepara-
tion,” according to student of-
ficials of the Mock Convention.

As grand marshall of the
lavish parade through Lex-
ington that traditionally kicks it
off, Warner will be the Mock
Convention’s principal good-
will ambassador, the students
said. The parade, which is ex-
pected to have more than 60
floats and a_ considerable
number of marching bands, not
to mention an actual elephant of
certified Republican lineage, is

  

WILLIAM BROCK

tentatively scheduled for 11
a.m., alsoon May 9.

Both Brock and Warner have
been active in GOP politics
since the early 1960s. Brock
began his series of upset vic-
tories over Tennessee
Democrats in 1962, when he was
first electsd to the U.S. House.
He was elected to the Senate in
1970, and in 1974 his party col-
leagues there chose him to head
the Republican Senatorial Cam-
paign Committee.

Senator
Warner

After he assumed the chair-
manship of the national com-
mittee in 1977, he sought to re-
establish its strsngth after the
declines associated with
Watergate and Richard Nixon.
In his initial test, the by-
elections in 1978, Republicans
gained almost 300 seats in state
legislatures across the nation,

Warner, who has been a
member of the W&L board of
trustees since 1968, became in-
volved in Republican politics as
a participant in several cam-
paigns, also in the ‘60s. He was

Late Story

 

Vandals Hit W&L,

Damage Boxwoods

by David Greer
Vandals damaged several
boxwoods on the Washington
and Lee University campus last
night. University spokesmen
say the damage could be as high
as several thousand dollars.
According to a university of-
ficial, extensive damage was
done to about two dozen English
boxwoods outside Newcomb
Hall, Tucker Hall, Howe Hall,
and the Dean of Students office.
No reason could be found for
the destruction and there are no

suspects. It is not known
whether the vandals were
students or local youths.

Apparently the vandals
jumped in the bushes or ripped
out the center branches.

Most of the plants can be sav-
ed, said a university
spokesman, but there will be
problems, as the plants grow
very slowly. For example, the
plants outside the Dean’s office]
are over 50 years old.

University Proctor Bob Mur-
ray is investigating the inci-
dent.

 

 

devotes particular attention to
efforts to keep down federal
spending and to limit the expan-
sion of federal powers.

Brock and Warner join

lineup — keynote speaker

pearance was announced
earlier this month.

Over Thanksgiving Break

Students’ Stereos Stolen

by Sam Campbell

Several robberies of
Washington and Lee student
property occurred during the
Thanksgiving vacation.

Scott Crawford, a member of
Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
reported that a padlock on his
door was ripped off its hinges in
the fraternity house. He listed a
Kenwood receiver, two Ken-

Several instances of van-

and Lee’s campus over the
Thanksgiving break.

the bulletin boards in front of
Payne Hall was torn off and
broken, as were several win-
downs windows in the building
itself.

Damage was done to the com-
puter system by a vandal on the
last Saturday night of break. An
adolescent reportedly threw
eggs through the wire protec-
tive cage at the central process-
ing unit after he had been using
a terminal.

were missing, along with 50

external cabinets, the egging
could have been costly if they
had reached the electronics.

The vandal apparently was
not a member of the W&L com-
munity, but had gained access
to the computer through a stu-
dent who had given him his user
number. The student who
divulged his number acted in
violation of the pledge signed at
the beginning of the term by all
users to protect their numbers
and access to the computer,
university officials said. He was
easily traced by the work areas
opened in areas opened at the
time of the incident.

Student Hits Centel

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has been charged with
Driving While Intoxicated after
he drove his jeep into the Centel
building downtown, early Satur-
day morning.

Mark Turner, a student from
Gainesville, Ga., was arrested
at 12:35 a.m. on Dec. 1. The in-
vestigating officer estimated
the damage to his 1978 Jeep
CJ-5 at $500. Centel has not yet

provided a damage estimate.

According to the police
report, Turner made a left turn
from Randolph Street onto
Washington Street and lost con-
trol of his vehicle. He then
struck the Lexington Telephone
Company office.

News Brief

Pigs In
Uniform

The Army used pigs in the
1950’s to test for radiation when
the effects of atomic blasts
were being investigated, a book
slated for release next summer
discloses. ’

The book, ‘‘Atomic Soldiers’”’
by columnist Jack Anderson’s
associate Howard Rosenberg,
details how the Porcine Platoon
was shaved, showered, and
neatly tailored in little U.S. Ar-
my uniforms—corporal pigs
had strips, officer pigs had
bars. All of the pig brigade were
quartered in the Pork Hilton,
near the atomic blasts.

There were really two groups
of test hogs. The First Pig Bat-
talion, fed downers and left out-
side all night, died from their
exposure. The Second Pig Bat-
talion had to wait so long for

 

their tests that they all grew out
of their uniforms and had to
have new outfits tailored, at
taxpayer expense, of course.

Finalizes
Dance

Plans

Plans are being finalized for
Washington and Lee’s Second
Annual Muscular Dystrophy
Dance Marathon to kick off its
fund-raising effort on the
weekend of Jan. 25-26.

The grand prize, for the
dancer who raises the largest
total of pledged contributions, is
an all-expense paid trip for two
to Nassau for three days and
two nights. In addition, there
will be a number of door prizes
and other special events.

Scheduled to wind up the
festivities are the Vandales, a
popular soul band from the
past, who will play for the
dancers from 10 p.m. until 2
a.m. Saturday night.

The Dance Marathon ex-
travaganza is officially titled
“Fighting M.D. for 30 Hours,”
and will have a boxing motif
with the participants dancing 30
rounds in their fight against

muscular dystrophy, a crippl-,

ing and fatal disease that at-
tacks the victim’s muscle
tissue.

Co-chairmen Jay Blumberg
and Jay Hemby told the Ring-
tum Phi that they have at least
50 Sweet Briar and Mary
Baldwin College girls already
signed up to dance. ‘‘Last year
we had more girls than guys.
This year we want at least
enough W&L guys to occupy all
the girls,’ Blumberg said.

The goal for this year’s Dance
Marathon is to raise $15,000. Ap-
proximately $13,000 was raised
last year.

After that episode, the crowd

but toward the 50,000 Iranian
students in this country as well.

There are currently no Ira-
nian students here at
Washington and Lee, and there
have not been any since 1974.

There are however, eight Ira-
nians currently attending the
Virginia Military Institute near-
by. Fortunately, they have not
yet suffered any hardships from
Americans due to the crisis in
their homeland.

The eight students are all
seniors, expecting to graduate
in May of this year.

That expectation received a
jolt last week when Governor
Dalton announced at a press
conference in Alexandria that
he is considering a request by a
member of the Virginia

Tehran are released. This
would apply to the cadets at
VMI

When Major J.L. Adams,
publicity officer at VMI, was

station in Reid Hall, dispersed.

asked about the possibility of
suspension for the Iranian
students, he replied, ‘‘We can-
not comment on that now. We
would probably have to comply,
but we’ll face that situation
when we come to it.”

Adams added that the Iranian
cadets “came here for an
education, and we are giving
them that. Our policy is to treat
them as any other student, and
we intend to stand by that.”’

The eight Iranians are all
members of the Iranian Navy,
and are at VMI in that capacity.
When asked if he thought this
presented a conflict of interest,
Adams repeated, ‘We do not

plan to treat them differently.”
It must be remembered
however, that all of these cadets
were members of the Shah’s
navy when they came to VMI.
For the time being, the Ira-
nian cadets at VMI, like the rest
of the world, can do nothing but
sit and wait, and observe what
happens in their homeland.

Rush To Be Shorter Next Year

by John Billmyre

Interfraternity Council
members learned Tuesday
evening that Rush will undergo
at least one major change next
year.

Fraternity members will not
be allowed to personally rush a
freshman before orientation.

The rule is the result of a Stu-
dent Affairs Committee recom-
mendation which was adopted
by the University Council Nov.
27.

SAC. made the _ proposal
because of complaints by facul-
ty members. The professors
feared that early contact and
other factors made fraternities
seem more important than
academics to freshmen.

The committee also con-
sidered the possibility of
holding Rush during the second
semester, but decided a delayed
formal Rush would not stop the
actual rushing process.

According to IFC President
Syd Farrar, many parents and
several students complained
about fraternity members
hounding them the moment
they set foot on campus.

The representatives’ reaction
to the change was mixed. Most
representatives did not com-
ment at all, but four of the reps
complained about the change
for several minutes.

Atwood
Elected To

Business
Association

The dean of Washington and
Lee University’s School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics,
Edward C. Atwood Jr., has been
elected to the executive com-
mittee of the Southern Business
Administration Association
(SBAA).

The organization is closely af-
filiated with the American
Assembly of Collegiate Schools
of Business, the agency that ac-
credited Washington and Lee’s
commerce program in 1927.
W&L is one of 200 colleges
whose program is accredited by
the national organization, of
some 1,000 business schools in
the nation. Atwood is a member
of the American Assembly’s
initial-accreditation commit-
tee.

He has been dean of the W&L
commerce school since 1969.
Prior to that, he was W&L’s
dean of students. Atwood is also
professor of economics. He
received his undergraduate,
master’s and Ph.D. degrees
from Princeton University.

   

‘“‘How can we get to know the

' freshmen very well if we are not

allowed to contact them im-
mediately?” said one represen-
tative. ‘‘The faculty tells us to
get to know these guys and then
tells us to stay away from them,
keeping us from really getting
to know them.”

But the overall sentiment was
against the change.

Fraternity members were
also pleased with one section of
a SAC report on fraternities
that said, ‘fraternities at W&L
will continue to be the primary
source of social contacts for the
students.”

Earlier in the meeting, Jay
Blumberg and Jay Hemby, co-
chairmen of the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon,
approached the IFC asking for
help with the event.

“‘As you know, there is a lot
the IFC can do for us,”
Blumberg said. He went on to
ask that fraternities not
schedule activities for the

Dance Marathon weekend, Jan.
25-26.

He also asked the IF€ to
donate kegs and encourage
pledges to participate in the
marathon dance.

The fraternity which raises
the most money will receive two
kegs of beer. The fraternity
with the best participation will

get its name ona plaque. The in-
‘dividual dancer who raises the

most money will win a trip to
Nassau.

The response to Blumberg’s
appeal was strongly in favor of
helping the Dance Marathon.

In other IFC business, Farrar
announced that Kappa Sigma
has been granted colony status
by its national fraternity,
located in Charlottesville.

The new members of Kappa
Sigma, which is trying to
restart at W&L, did not attend
the meeting Tuesday because
they were being initiated in
Charlottesville.

The IFC will meet again after
Christmas break on Jan. 14.

SBC Votes Out A+

The faculty of Sweet Briar
College has cracked down on
grade inflation. The A plus, or a
4.3 on a 4.0 scale, was voted out
of the grading system with little
discussion at a recent faculty
meeting.

Some faculty members felt
the A plus had been misused by

Noted Journalists To
Speak At Ethics Seminar

Clifford G. Christians, com-
munications professor at the
University of Illinois, will give a
lecture Thursday (Dec. 6) at
Washington and Lee University
as part of W&L’s annual pro-
gram in journalism ethics.

Christians will speak in the
Mary Moody Northen
Auditorium of W&L’s new
undergraduate library at 8 p.m.
on ‘Golden Means and
Penultimate Ends in Media
Ethics.” The public is invited to
attend.

Educated at Calvin College
and Calvin Theological
Seminary in Grand Rapids,
Mich., Christians developed an
early interest in journalism
ethics and philosophy. For
several years he was director of
communications for the educa-
tion division of the Christian
Reformed Church, with exten-
sive responsibility in magazine

editing, book publishing and
development of adult education
curricula. After going to the
University of Illinois in 1970, he
attained his Ph.D. degree—
again on the subject of the
social philosophy of com-
munications.

Christians is the author of
numerous monographs and ar-
ticles, and a book, ‘‘Respon-
sibility in Mass Communica-
tions,’ the third edition of
which is scheduled for publica-
tion next spring.

The Christians lecture will
begin the four-day weekend
conference for the visiting jour-
nalists, scheduled to continue
through Sunday, Dec. 9. In
Washington and Lee’s
academic setting, the visitors
will make use of the universi-
ty’s recently expanded library
resources and hold a number of
formal and informal workshops
with journalism students.

Review By Parker Potter

Ziegler Comedy In Theatre

Tom Ziegler’s new comedy
Weeds, playing through Satur-
day in the Troubadour Theatre,
is a fine way to spend an even-
ing. This opportunity to watch a
new play coming to terms with
itself shouldn’t be passed up.

Let me state at the outset that
the play and the production
don’t just have potential. They
are genuinely good. Certain tru-
ly inspired moments, though,
lead one to believe that Weeds
will be even better before all is
said and done.

Very briefly, the play is about
Clare (Pam Simpson) a widow
of 48 who is feeling her age. She
suspects the onset of “the
change”’ and longs for a grand-
child.

Living with Clare are
Henrietta and Harvey (Champe
Leary and Jay Blumburg) her
daughter and Leary and Jay
Blumburg) her daughter and
son-in-law. Harvey, a yet to be
discovered filmmaker, and
Henrietta are thirtyish veterans
of the sit-ins, lay-ins, and love-
ins of the late 60’s and early
70’s. They are hippies gone to
seed.

The play rolls through one
comic loop-d-loop after another
to show how Clare, thought to be
frigid and prudish, is not ex-
periencing menopause but
rather, pregnancy. And the plot
takes off from there.

As I said, Weeds is a good
play and this production,
directed by Ziegler and Lee
Kahn seems to do it justice.

Pam Simpson does quite well
as Clare. Particularly appeal-
ing is her ability to capture the
range of emotions of a woman
suddenly jolted from what she
sees as the end of womanhood
right back to the beginning.

And Simpson’s act III is just
marvelous. Her Clare is at the
center of all the action and
delightfully in control. Winsome

but not cloying, she can’t help
but be lovable here as she turns
her problem into probably the
best thing that ever happened to
her.

Champe Leary as Henrietta,
is blessed with excellent comic
timing. She knows how to
deliver a line without overplay-
ing it, and does particularly
well in the first two acts.
However, she loses some of her
range of expression in Act III,
when the strength of Simpson’s
performance makes Leary’s
whining just a bit monotonous
and annoying.

My largest complaint with the
play is Jay Blumburg’s Harvey.
Blumburg is full of energy, as
he must be, but even budding
young Canine
cinamatographers have a tone
of voice other than shrill. I
suspect that an infusion of
Zonker Harris cool might make
Harvey more able to connect
with his genuinely funny lines.

A real gem is Bill Rough’s
Leo. Leo is the father of Clare’s
child, a wheel chair bound
garden columnist who lives two
flights up. His voice and facial
expressions absolutely light up
the stage and his proposal scene
with Clare supurbly affecting.

The rest of the characters, in
particular Clare’s banker,
Howard (Chris Schram) and his
gay wrestler boyfriend (Mark
Suber) are played broadly and
quite fortuitously, not to the
detriment of the play. All these
agents of comic relief are suffi-
ciently far outside the main ac-
tion of the play that they do not
intrude on it.

Which brings us back to the
play itself. Weedsis not just a
promising play, it is a good
play. But it still has some grow-
ing todo.

Certain bits of it are pure
magic. Clare’s discription of
her husband and its wordplay is
amazingly witty and Leo’s pro-
posal is tender and touching.

All of Ziegler’s comic twists -
are original and well carried
out. Even more impressive than
the deft plot is the way in which
Ziegler plays with the audience
and shares things with it (Leo’s
plant stories) that not all the
characters are able to ap-
preciate.

For all the originality and wit,
though, mixed in with all the
marvelous lines (you either get
an abortion or get married, but
you did both!) there are some
gags that you can spot a mile
away.

There is a minor problem
with tone; comedy and life can
go together — as they do here —
but sometime Ziegler’s
preparation for their co-
existence here just ins’t enough.
On occasion the play almost
seems to want to make a social
statement on abortion, but then
backs off. Finally, we may not
be quite prepared for Clare’s
dramatic metamorphosis in Act
Il.

But the play and the produc-
tion both work. Ziegler is on the
right track, impressively so. So
is the cast. Weedshas some
growing to do, but it is a sturdy
seedling, in the hands of an able
group of gardeners. I plan to see

What better gift than the gift
of music? If you’re stumped on
what to get your sister for
Christmas or you can’t face
picking out yet another tie for
dad, here are some suggestions.
The Record Store has
something to satisfy all tastes
and ages.

1) For your sometimes
girlfriend who can’t decide if
you’re really her type or not,
but doesn’t want to talk about it
in case she decides you are:
Fickle Heart, Sniff ‘n’ the

Tears; Head Games,
Foreigner; Blue Valentine,
Tom Waitts.

2) For your little sister who
has just taken her first dance
course at Myrtle’s Academy of
Dance and is pirouetting around

an imaginary Nureyev: Arabes-
que, John Klemmer; Morning
Dance, Spyrogyra; Feets Don’t
Fail Me Now, Merbie Mancok.

3) For your father who keeps
harping on the awful music kids
listen to these days and why
your grades keep dropping:
Best of Nat King Cole;
Schoolboy on Disgrace, Kinks;
Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull.

4) For your mother who is
always complaining about the

cold and in whose eyes you can

do no wrong: Dirt Band, An
American Dream; To Drive the
Cold Winter Away — a fireside
presentation of music for mer-
rymaking down the ages.
Adeline Goldsten

it again.

Eye & Ear:From The Bookstore

Panic is rampant. Term papers overdue; com-
puter terminals unavailable; equations, both
mathematical and personal, unbalanced. And
ahead loom exams.

Beyond—on the far horizon—lies Christmas.
When to find time to shop? What to give to whom?
Where to buy the perfect present for the perfect
person? In the interests of student sanity I’ll take
on the unlikely role of Christmas angel.

Books are, of course, the delightful solution to
the Christmas-gift panic. They do not disappear in
quick gulps; they do not go out of style; they come
in all sizes and prices. They are not made of
plastic and their bearings do not wear out. Books
are gifts that last!

To turn Christmas chores into joys:

1) For younger brothers, sisters, nieces and
nephews: Jack Tales; The Chronicles of Narnia:
Reptiles Do The Strangest Things.

2) For the grandmother who always remembers
your birthday with generosity: The American Im-

age; The Last Enchantment; The Simon &
Schuster Crosswood Puzzle Book.

3) For the father who is always wondering what
the hell you are doing with all that money he has
sent you—show him with: White House Years;
Sylvia Porter’s New Money Book; Fix-It- Yourself
Manual.

4) For the mother who doesn’t ask the wrong
questions and who laughs at the right time; Habit
of Being: 60 Minute Gourmet Cookbook; Medusa
And The Snail.

5) For the one-and-only girl of the moment, A
Flight Of Butterflies; A Tolkien Bestiary; Les
Tres Riches Heures.

For the roommate who has everything: General
Lee’s College; The Joy Of Sex; Complete Sherlock
Holmes.

7) For the roommate who doesn’t have
anything: General Lee’s College; The Joy Of Sex;
Complete Sherlock Holmes.

Society Presents Kasper Houser

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film Society will pr-
sent its third feature of the season, Werner Her-
zog’s The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser, on Friday
and Saturday, December 7 and 8, at 8 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘C’’ of the Law School. The movie is
free and open to all members of the campus and
local communities,

Werner Herzog is one of the two most important
directors to emerge in the West German film
renaissance of the 70’s, perhaps the most vigorous
national cinema in Europe during that time, and
Kaspar Hauser is probably his best film. Herzog is
the director of the ski short we showed here last
winter, The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner,
and this movie, like that one, consists of
breathtakingly beautiful images.

The Mystery of Kaspar Hauser (1975) is a varia-
tion on the myth of the wild or feral child, the child
brought up in isolation from human society and
civilization. Perhaps the best known version of

this myth is the classical story of Romulus and
Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, who are
said to have been raised by a she-wolf. In the film,
Herzog’s treatment of the myth is preceded by
Truffaut’s remarkable meditation on the virtues
and limits of civilization. The Wild Child (1970).

Like Truffaut's film, Herzog’s Kaspar Hauser is
based on a true story. Herzog’s movie shows a
young man raised in almost total darkness and
isolation from human contact who in 1820, when he
is nearly twenty, is deposited at dawn in the
square of a small German town. (The fact that the
actor who plays the lead has had a life similar in
certain respects to Hauser’s gives his per-
formance added intensity. )

With great wit and charm, and not a few reser-
vations, Herzog documents the townpeople’s ef-
forts to introduce Kaspar to the virtues of civilized
life — walking upright, eating with utensils, talk-
ing, reading, writing, appreciating music, reason-
ing logically, and so forth. The movie constitutes a

Movie Review

APOCALYPSE NOWIn Technovision.

Directed by Francis Coppola.

Written by John Milius and Francis Coppola.
Narration by Michael Herr.

With Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Marlon Bran-
do, and Dennis Hopper.

It’s a spectacle. It has more powerful scenes,
more sustained tension, more awesome visions,
and just more amazing footage than any other re-
cent film. It’s visually overwhelming.

The plot is taken from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of
Darkness with Michel Herr (who wrote Dispatches)
overseeing the change of scene to Vietnam. At its
core, the plot is simple: a journey up river to an in-
tensely evil place, both the source of the river and
of the evil.

Colonel Kurtz (Brando) has broken off his ties
with the army and his unites are operating (with
great success) in Cambodia beyond army control.
The top brass realize he is insane (shades of Dr.
Tarr and Professor Fether!) and sends Captain
Willard (Sheen) to assassinate him, after a first
assassin has joined Kurtz’s forces.

Willard is given a Navy boat, and after Lt. Col-
onel Kilgore (Duval) secures its mouth, they move
right river after Kurtz. Through Kilgore is under
orders to aid Willard, he also wants to secure the
mouth of the river because the waves there are
great for surfing. Kilgore surfs during the battle,
after his air-cavalry charges to Wagner’s ‘‘Ride of
the Valkyries.”’

The journey up river is much like that in Hert-
Z0g’S Aggire the Wrath of God, where the crew
perishes one by one to an unseen foe. Along the
way they encounter a USO show in the middle of a
jungle, and a bridge built everyday only to be
destroyed every night by the Viet Cong. The in-
sane ineffectiveness of the American effort
becomes obvious.

The only one winning is Kurtz. He has abandon-
ed the army and set up base in Cambodia (neutral

Home For The Holidays:

Dash Reviews Coppola’s
Apocalypse Now

It’s an old story: the Mafia beat out the Cammora
for control of the NY mobs because while the Cam-
mora would slit the tongues of squealers before
killing them, the Mafia would castrate them
before killing them. The ruthless, calculated in-
vocation of horror. What makes Kurtz the very in-
carnation of evil is not his deadly efficiency, but
his amoral attitude and his purposelessness.

This is where the movie fails: how can one show
evilness that is so conceptual? What makes Kurtz
worse than the V.C. or the Americans is that they
were fighting for ideologies whereas Kurtz was
just fighting. The movie only hints at the dif-
ference.

The most successful image is when Kurtz talks
about how he came to be the way he is. He says
that one his first tour in Vietnam he was sent to in-
oculate the children of a village against polio.
When his company returned to the village later
they found that the V.C. had chopped off all the lit-
tle inoculated arms and had thrown them into a
huge pile both to show their hatred for the
Americans and to terrorize the villagers. Kurtz
then realizes that the soldier who would win was
the morally strong soldier who was nonetheless
barbarically ruthless. A vision not unlike
Cromwell’s, except Kurtz’s is amoral in outlook.

This movie is another failure to represent Viet-
nam. Coming Home, the Deer Hunter, and
Apocalypse Now have all missed the basic
message of the war that was captured so brilliant-
ly in Hearts and Minds: that we lost the war not
through a lack of military resolve (though that
was a factor) but because we failed to win over the
Vietnamese people.

Even with its faults the movie is brilliant spec-
tacle — awesome, flamboyant, and breathtaking.
If you can, you should see it on a wide screen with
Dolby Sound (i.e., not in Big Lex.).

(Movie Quiz: In Apocalypse Now what does

This week’s tragedy in Cinn-
cinati, Ohio, at theWho concert
brings to mind some other im-
portant disasters which were
associated with musical groups.
The most recent disaster,
however, has left 11 dead and
eight injured, but investigations
as to why such an occurance
was permitted to happen will
not explain the human motiva-
tion to trample another human
being.

As close as the wire services
will let me construct, this is
what happened. At a festival-
seating arrangement concert of
the Who, an extremely popular
English rock act, a crowd had
been gathered most of the after-
noon in order to have a chance
at a good seat.

Not long before the concert
was to begin, while the band
was making a sound check, a
door was inadvertantly opened
by an employee of the arena for
ventilation. The sound check by
the band was misconstrued by
the waiting crowds outside to be
the concert starting without
them, whereupon they rushed to
the entrance.

What becomes obvious is that
the people in front of the crowd
knew that the doors were not
really open, and those in the
rear thought they were.

The concert went on as plann-
ed because the Who were not
told of the problems at the door,
and when finally told right after
the show they were, as all
around them attested,
devastated.

Immediate repercussions of

city
manager of Cinncinati as to
why the concert was not
assigned-seat instead of festival
or ‘‘first come” seating.
Although no formal investiga-
tion will be completed in the
near future, I’m sure a major

finding will be that any pro- ©

moter given the opportunity to
stage a Who concert will want to
capitalize on the tremendous
draw power of a band of such
superstar status, and that, as
any promoter will attest, many
bodies can fit in a concert hall,
if there are no seats on the floor.

The trampling of 11 innocents
in Cinncinati is not at all a
remote occurance in the world
or rock.

It is regrettable, but at times
rock gets out of hand in a con-
cert environment, either by
deliberate provocation or acci-
dent, as the Who _ incident
seems to have been.

Anyone that has seen the
movie “‘Gimme Shelter’’ about
the Rolling Stones free concert
held at the Altamont Speedway
in California in 1969 will
remember the black youth be-
ing stabbed to death by a biker.
From the same film, there was
also a beating of a naked man
with puol cues by the same
bikers for another unknown
reason.

Another incident that makes
a case for the continued
violence associated with rock
‘n’ roll would be the Alice
Cooper concerts in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, during a_ three-night
engagement which saw the

in 68) where he is out terrorizing the Viet Cong.

largest-ever indoor audience.

Each night after the three
shows, mobs of youths roamed
the streets in gangs of hun-
dreds, looking for other gangs
with which to fight.

Police estimate that over a
thousand were injured as a
direct result of these provoked
gang wars, and-over 200 were
actually killed during street
brawls.

Aerosmith has been a victim
of violence, not only from fans
in an arena, but outside in daily

if not hostile audiences,
Aerosmith’s Joe Perry suffered
severe damage to his right hand
from an explosive device
thrown on stage, while lead

singer Steve Tyler received a
gash above his eye from a
similar explosive.
Firecrackers and _ other
pyrotechnics are an increasing
phenomena at concerts today,
and someone, either spectator
or performer is hurt by in-
discriminate ‘‘practical jok-
ing.”

Text Of EC
Security Report

This committee accepts the fact that there will be some damage
to the University physical plant in any given time period. However,
there is ample evidence of a growing lack of respect for all property
located on the campus. The Athletic Department reports that
vehicles have been driven onto the athletic fields. In other in-
cidents, spray paint has been used to write on the Colonnade, wind-
shields of student automobiles have been broken, and books have
disappeared from the new library and Lewis Hall.

There is some evidence pointing to students as the perpetrators
of these and other acts. The Student Control Committee and the Ex-
ecutive Committee adequately handle cases brought before them
involving Washington and Lee students who steal or damage pro-
perty on campus. Many cases of student misconduct go unreported.
The function of the Student Control Committee may not be well
known to the Student body. Also, many students who do know of the
Committee are apathetic toward reporting cases. The Student Con-
trol Committee has jurisdiction over Student misbehavior which is
not covered by the Honor Code. Students who know of vandalism or
other campus security problems should report the facts to Student
Control. The current chairman is Tim Brooks.

Several steps should be taken in order to make the function of the
Student Control Committee better known to students. The Commit-
tee will place notices around campus describing the types of of-
fenses it deals with, maintaining the confidentiality of the accused,
or those receiving penalties from the Student Control Committee.
The charter of the Student Control Committee shall be posted in the
EC bulletin board.

The Executive Committee can help publicize the role of the Stu-
dent Control Committee. It should request that all incidents of theft
or vandalism which may involve students be reported immediately
to Student Control.

Students involved in theft of property cai be deait with by the Ex-
ecutive Committee under the Honor Code. It bears repeating that
each student has a moral obligation to uphold the Honor System
against thieves.

2. The Law School

There are some problems which this committee has identified
which are peculiar to the Law School. These arise from its physical
isolation and the presence of female students. Otherwise, the pro-
blems of the Law School are treated in the general discussion
above.

Lewis Hall is isolated from the main part of the campus. The
bridge over Woods Creek has some lighting, but the fixtures are of
a variety which leaves the bulbs exposed to vandalism. The Ex-
ecutive Committee has been informed by President Huntley that
permanent light fixtures of a more secure type were ordered six
months ago.

The Law School has a substantial number of female students. The
women live in the Woods Creek apartments, Baker Dormitory and
in town. This committee received some complaints about the ade-

EC Discusses Campus Security

(continued from page 1)

Stealing in Student Center

Focus next turned to the
University Center and the pro-
blems of stealing and general
rowdiness. University Food
Service Director Gerald Darrell
said, ‘I’m very disturbed about
it. I’m thinking about keeping a
log of complaints.”’

“If you come in at lunch (in
the dining hall), set something
of value down, it will be gone by
the time you leave,” said Dar-
rell, ‘‘A vear or two age it got so
bad that we were going to set a
trap.” They were advised
against it, he added.

“I don’t know where the stuff
is going but it’s going,” he said.
“People, though, seem to be
wising up.”

Problems in the Cockpit

Concerning the Cockpit, Dar-
rell said, “If a student is drunk,
it seems like a license for him to
do anything. I had an incident

-earlier this year when people

almost got in a fight. I’m look-
ing for advice,’ Darrell said,
asking how to handle students
who get out of hand.

“I still think the best thing to
do is to take their name,”’ said
third-year Law Rep. John
Fraser. ‘‘Avoid physical force,”’
he added. ‘‘It may sound like a
limp-wristed approach — to
things,’’ but someone could get
hurt or bring a lawsuit.

“Some people have said to me
that under-aged juveniles are
being served beer in the
Cockpit,’’ said Poole. ‘‘I think it
definitely should be tightened
up,” he added.

“This is the first time
anybody has mentioned that to
me,” said Darrell. ‘I haven’t
heard of it.’’ He said he would
definitely takesome action.

tatives were added to the Stu-
dent Control Committee.

and Vice President of the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

The move now puts a total of
four law school members on the
SCC. Each member is the presi-
dent of his respective class. The
change takes effect in January.

SBA President Bill Garrett
said the move would better
represent all the law classes.
He added that currently
undergraduate SCC members
represent 130 students while the
law school has a 160 to one ra-
tion. The change will give each
law student 110 ) students.

“T talked to Dean John about
it and we do have the authority
to change it,’’ said EC Presi-
dent Steve Abraham. “The
reasons are pretty good for a
change.”

The unanimous EC vote was
labeled “heartwarming” by
Garrett.

Cold Check

The Cold Check Committee
returned its last $100 loan to the
EC.

CCC Chairman James Vines
also reported that the commit-
tee’s short term bad check

_ figure of $49.69 was ‘‘the lowest

it has been as far as I can
remember. The new rules are a
success,’’ Vines added.

Discussion followed, resulting
in two defeated motions con-
cerning the CCC’s policy for
first bad-check offenders. A
proposal for a $2 uniform fine
with the option of paying Carole
Chappell was defeated and
resulted in Vines stating ‘‘we
are not just some discount
house.”’

The move, said Poole, was to
cut time from CCC meetings.
EC Secretary Cove Geary
disagreed, saying, ‘‘The fact
that they have to go before the
CCC should say something.”’

Calyx

Calyx Business Manager
John Hamilton reported’ that
they had spent $13,431.26 to date
and had collected $18,995.18.

Sitting fees collected totaled
$6,115, said Hamilton, a figure
$36 higher than last month.

Hamilton added that the patron
contributions total $3,000
“‘which helps.”’

Hamilton said the senior

full and outstanding debts, one

an $8,000 bill from Hunter

$10,000.

The yearbook’s next deadline,
said Hamilton, will be on Jan.
29.

Mock Convention

Mock Convention Secretary
Rick Corrigan reported that
things are going well and they
are “definitely working at it,”
to get speakers for January.

Poole asked if any speakers
were being booked who gave an
“overall view,’’ such as jour-
nalists. Corrigan replied that
they were focusing on political
speakers.

Ariel

Ariel editor Chris Faye said
no expenditures were incurred
for the month. He added that
the expected cost of this year’s
first 48-page publication would
be $1,5000.

The Ariel will be ready on
Dec. 14 with Faye adding that

4 the majority of the copies would
‘be held until after Christmas
vacation.

No Time for MD

A petition asking for five
minutes in Tuesday’s Honor
Code speech in Lee Chapel to
explain the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon
was voted down.

MD Rep. Palmore Clarke ex-
plained that the talk was only to ©
make people aware of the
marathon.

“This is W&L’s big charity. I
don’t think it’s too ridiculous to
give five minutes of our time,”
said Poole. Wenke agreed, say-
ing ‘it was a good time to hit
them.”

Abraham disagreed, saying
that the talk should be devoted
solely to the honor system
because of the seriousness of
the topic. Allen added he
“agreed with Steve 100 per-
cent.”

Members of the committee
studying extra-curricular ac-
tivity courses to be offered in
the spring term said they had
seven courses, two of which are
bartending and _ self-defense.
Subcommittee Rep. Sam Allen
added that they will be taking
suggestions for other activities.

“The present plan,’ said
Allen, ‘‘is to get people to do it
for free.”’

UC Meeting

 

SAC Rush Change Passed

by Alan Kendrick

The University Council
devoted nearly all of their mon-
thly meeting last week (Nov.
28) to a discussion of the report
made by the Student Affairs
Committee on a study of the
relationship between
academics and fraternity life.

The report, which was five
pages in length, was a draft of
recommended rules governing
fraternities to be amended or
added to existing rules by the
Faculty Executive Committee.
The SAC addressed the question
of whether fraternities con-
tribute to academic life by em-
phasizing that no generalization
could be made in this meeting.

The SAC report, which was
augmented by two tables com-
paring grade-point averages,
stated that some fraternities
promote academic achieve-
ment and others do not and con-
cluded by saying that academic
performance should remain
primarily the responsibility of
the individual.

Five suggestions that frater-
nities might follow are to imple-
ment “‘upperclass tutors, study
halls, a chapter library as a
resource and quiet area, quiet
hours, and assignment of rooms
by grade point average.’’ The
recommended rules are that all
pledges be required to have a
1.9 cumulative G.P.A. before in-
itiation; that each fraternity ap-
point a Scholarship Chairman
to perform specific duties and
“promote an environment in
which academic achievement is
respected within the chapter’’;
that the IFC publish in the Rush
Book. each year the fraternity
GPA’s in comparison with the
all-men’s average.

The question of continuing
fraternity rush in the fall was
discussed at length, and had
been included in the SAC report.
Feelings against fall Rush in-
cluded an opinion that so much
pressure is placed on freshmen
to join fraternities upon their
arrival at W&L that they
overemphasize the priority that
fraternities should take in their
first term of college.

A recommendation was sup-
ported that freshmen not be
rushed until after Orientation.

EC Security Report

quacy of security in Baker. Two suggestions have been made for
remedying the problems in Baker. First, the women themselves
should keep all of the outside entrances to Baker locked after dark.
Second, the women should be assigned to the second floor of the
dormitory to deny access to their rooms through ground level win-
dows. Both of these are or will shortly be initiated.

Another problem that the University should deal with is the use eof
the student directory to harass feamle students. Law School women
have been subjected to harassing phone calls several times in re-
cent years. Some of the calls have been of a type that reveal the
caller’s source of the phone number. Some system that uses initials
for first and middle names for the law students in the student direc-
tory would probably cut down on this.

3. Juvenile Offenses on and off campus.

It is the opinion of this committee that Lexington is enduring an
outbreak of juvenile vandalism, theft, rudeness and violence. The
problem has spilled over onto the Washington and Lee campus.

Automobiles have been stolen from the campus parking lots.
Fraternities and dormatories have been pilfered. University pro-
perty has been damaged. Locked bicycles have been stolen.
Students have been assaulted on Main Street by juvenile gangs. Car
windows have been broken and tires slashed in almost every cam-
pus parking lot.

It is not enough to say that some vandalism is inevitable. This .

committee feels that the current level of theft, damage and assault
is not acceptable in a town as small as Lexington. The problems i in
the town spill over onto the campus because there is no clear
dividing line.

This committee suggests that any person not connected with the
Washington and Lee community and conducting themselves in a
suspicious manner be arrested for trespassing. We realize that a
minor may have to be warned before the police can take action. If
the standard law enforcement avenues will not deter unwanted
juveniles from entering the campus, the University may wish to
consider civil suits against their parents.

This committee also suggests that the Executive Committee
discuss the problem of juvenile gangs with University and city of-
ficials. Chief Kirby of the Lexington police department and Com-
monwealth’s attorney Beverly Read have stated that they are will-
ing to discuss the problem. The groups of juveniles who harass peo-
ple on the sidewalks are easily identified, and should be prosecuted.

The Ring-tum Phi’s Annual Exec

by Joe Scott

This year’s student body Executive Com-
mittee has been busy debating and in most
cases acting on issue of current interest to
Washington and Lee’s student body. The ap-
parent surge of vandalism and theft against
students throughout town resulted in a sub-
committee report advocating prosecution for
trespassers. A renewed effort to insure the
confidentiality of pass-fail procedures ended
in a recommendation to the faculty Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees. Even the ques-
tion of coeducation is being studied by an EC
subcommittee. This is just part of a record to
be proud of.

In most cases, committee budgets were
slashed to the bone by an EC critically short
of student body funds. Many complained,
some with reason, but in the final tally, the
slimmer budgets showed signs of fairness. It
was an unfortunately year for the fencing
club.

Perhaps the real test of EC awareness will
come when revisions to the White Book
(honor code) are debated in the future. Many
feel the honor system needs major restructur-
ing and point to the increase in theft and the
senseless vandalism as just two examples.
Some feel it is irretrievable and un-
salvagable. Certainly their progess on this
matter will be watched closely.

 

Steve Abraham

EC President Steve Abraham is one of three
returning committee members. He knows by
experience EC procedures, obscure by impor-
tant details and runs the meetings fairly and
objectively. Rarely do meetings get out of
hand.

Some have complained that Abraham tries
to control everything. Though occasionally
correct, the point must be made that a weak
president would do an ineffective job.

His comments are researched, open and
consistent. His record shows he had done a
good job.

 

Les Cotter

Vice-president Les Cotter is well versed as
to the rules and procedures of the EC. When
debate bogs down, he usually cites a specific

 

rule and subsequent discussion seems more to
the point. His other comments, mostly conser-
vative, are well worth listening to.

Perhaps Cotter’s finest achievement is the
unenviable task of putting together the EC’s
budget. Juggling hundreds of figures takes
long hours of dedication. Unfortunately, few
persons realize the amount of work this en-
tails.

Though not one of the EC’s most outspoken
members, he obviously is doing a more than
adequate job.

 

Cove Geary

Geary is facing a formidable task in fulfill-
ing his duties as well as his predecessor, Tom
McCarthy. McCarthy did an outstanding job
and was probably one of the best secretaries
the EC has ever had.

Geary is prompt in typing and distributing
the EC minutes and takes long and adequate
notes.

His comments, though restricted by his
secretarial duties, are objective and in-
teresting. He usually agrees with the majori-
ty opinion.

 

John Fraser

Third year Law Representative John
Fraser is emerging as one of the leaders of
the EC. His frank, open and concerned at-
titudes are starting to cut through red tape.
He deals with the heart of an issue and does
not worry about knowing every single detail.

The students he represents sould be proud
of their official. He rallies for SAB films to be
shown in Lewis Hall and gives needed input of
law school opinions.

Volunteering for numerous committees
Shows that he is interested in the student
government process. He rarely fails to in-
cisively discuss the issue under consideration
and consistently maintains a ‘hands off
policy” when dealing with other student com-
mittees and organizations.

His carefully measured arguments should
carry more weight with the committee than
they have thus far. He is one to watch at
future EC meetings.

 

Sam Allen

First year Law Representative Sam Allen
is a recent addition to the committee and is
still familiarizing himself with EC procedure.
The few comments he makes show a sincere
interest in current policies and procedures.
He is now looking into a law school policy
which enables professors to personally
change grades through a fractional fluxua-
tion.

He presently sits on a subcommittee study-
ing the possibility of extracurricular ac-
tivities in the spring term and showed con-
cern for the ‘harsh wording” of the security
committee proposal. ‘

The old cliche of getting your feet wet ap-
plies here and can only be concluded by say-

 

ing that we will hear a lot more input from

Allen. He appears to be outspoken on many
issues.

 

  

wi lla
Jay Blumberg

Junior EC representative Jay Blumberg of-
fers a unique down-to-earth approach in EC
meetings—a welcome change in student
government. He constantly offers frank opi-

nions and advice, but more importantly, ques-
tions subcommittees when they give their

 

“

monthly reports.

His record speaks for itself: he currently
heads the Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon and heads the subcommittee con-
sidering coeducation. Determination is the
word that best describes him. He also has
deep concern for current Student problems
and is not afraid to fight tradition. It is un-
fortunate that he has served only one year on
the committee.

  

Dee Keesler

Frankly, we have not heard enough from
Dee Keesler, a returning member of the EC.
The senior representative has rallied for
squash club funding and a coffee lounge in the
library (personal interests), but is growing
progressively quieter. Keesler generally sup-

ports the majority but he fights strongly for
what he believes. His opinions aie well worth
listening to and lean toward the conservative
side.

He is aware of student opinion and is
knowledgable of EC procedures. Keesler’s
voice is sorely missed but will hopefully
return in the next semester.

Junior representative Bob Willis is definite-
ly one of the powers sitting on the committee.

return in the next semester.

   

Bob Willis
Junior representative Bob Willis is definite-
ly one of the powers sitting on the committee.

He understands the issues, realizes the pro-
blems, if any, and always has something to
say.

Being a perfectionist in grammar and
sentence structure, though, sometimes works
in a negative fashion—it occasionally leads
the EC off the subject or hopelessly entangles
it on a minor point.

Willis also comments on most issues
brought up and usually brings out an in-
teresting twist on a topic. From time to time
his opinions solve debates by offering com-
promises which appeal to all the parites in-
volved.

His role appear to be that of a peace-maker,
the one who satisfies all sides. It is apparent,
though, that the decision reached is usually
the one he endorsed all along.

 

Bruce Poole

Junior representative Bruce Poole is
bright, eager and always ready to tackle a
new issue. His membership on various sub-
committees shows his enthusiasm to par-
ticipate and his comments are frequent as
well as spontaneous.

Always receptive to other points of view, he
argues effectively and sides mostly with the
majority. He is not afraid to question the
judgment of another EC member.

 

Jim Wenke

Sophomore representative Jim Wenke
seems to have a similar down-to-earth at-
titude, like Blumburg, and is quick to question
a point he does not understand. He speaks oc-
casionally and usually comments on the
broad overall picture. He thinks things out
and does not comment off the top of his head.

He views seem short, concise and to the
point. Wenke also appears to hate
bureaucratic red tape.

Photos By John Lowe

 

Nelson Ould

Interest and concern for current issues are
reflected in sophomore representative Nelson
Ould’s record this year. He always volunteers
for subcommittee posts and devotes a lot of
energy to his job.

Occasional overreaction to criticism makes
Ould seem defensive of his performance, but
his frequent comments are a welcome addi-
tion. He will probably return on next year’s
EC.

 
   

Bill Scheneker

The freshman representative seems in-
terested in the EC but has had little to say or
do, probably because he is the newest
member on the committee. His questions ap-
pear more for his personal enlightenment, but
his comments until now appear conservative.
It will be interesting to see how quickly he
opens up and gives his true opinions.

While anybody can assess a committee’s
successes and failures just by attending its
meetings and hearing each member’s views,
there is another side to the EC—the closed ex-
ecutive session for honor trials and private
conferences which the public does not see.
The time devoted to this hidden aspect is stag-
gering and probably takes a toll on many
members’ stamina.

We gratefully thank the EC for putting in so
much time and effort in working to make our
student government run smoothly.

 

EC Issues Pass-Fail

Recommendation

by Joe Scott

An Executive Committee
recommendation to make pass-
fail courses confidential be-
tween the student and the
registrar was unanimously
passed at the Nov. 26 EC
meeting.

The recommendation also
States that courses not offered
with a pass-fail grade should be
specified in the Washington and
Lee catalog.

This proposal was submitted
at the faculty EC’s meeting last
week, but must first go to the
Committee on Courses and
Degrees before it can be con-
sidered by the faculty EC.

“There is no legitimate pur-
pose in the teacher’s knowing
the student is taking (the
course) pass-fail,”” said EC
Third Year Law Rep. John
Fraser. “I think the pass-fail
option is a good one.”’

“T think the thing that worries
everybody is the influence of
the grade,”’ said EC Sophomore
Rep. Nelson Ould. He added
that the reason why he brought
up the motion was because a
student had complained to him.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it had collected
$282 in receipts from the Glen
Phillips band concert held in the
Cockpit but it had lost money on
its film showing of Soylent
Green.

“It probably wasn’t the most
popular film in the world,” said
SAB Co-chairman David Har-
pole. ‘‘People didn’t quite make
it over there.” (Lewis Hall)

When asked about Fancy
Dress progress, Harpole said
that the SAB had “started
ordering things and are getting

 

rough figures together.’’ Pro-

gress is going smoothly, he add-
ed.

The Ring-tum Phi reported ..
was running $800 over budget
and that the paper would print
27 issues this year.

“For Parent’s Weekend we
got $260 all together,” said R-t P
Business Manager Kevin
McGowan. “‘This puts us $1,200
over the subscription ceiling we
budgeted for,’’ he added.

Concerning the problem of
newspapers not being mailed on
time, McGowan replied that it
was the first time he had heard
about it. ‘They should have
been sent home.”

Changes in the Commerce
School exam distribution
system now require that
authorized persons will per-
sonally distribute the exams.
The Commerce School library
will also be off limits to those
taking tests.

EC President Steve Abraham
and Vice President Les Cotter
said they spoke with Commerce
Dean Edward C. Atwood and
worked out the agreement.

The procedure of alphabetical
distribution will remain the
same but students receiving
their exams will now have their
names checked. Names will
also be crossed-off once
students hand their tests in.

The University Infirmary’s
complaint box, reported
Abraham, has been installed
but as of yet no forms have been
made up. “‘It’s hard to tell what
it’s there for,” said Abraham,
who also volunteered to per-
sonally type up the question-
naires.

Discussion of the submitted
Security Committee report
from this meeting was held for
the Dec. 3 EC meeting.

From the Pressbox

A Final Look
At Football

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

 

 

With exams nearing and the Holiday season filling
the air, let’s take just a minute to look back on the 1979

W&L football season.

The football Generals once again improved on its.
record from the previous year. After a dismal 2-8
season in 1978, the 1979 team upped its record to 3-7
and there were signs of improvement.

With youngsters like Rich Hachenburg, Steve Cor-
beille, Chris Cavalline and kicker Bill Devine, the
Generals’ offense can hope for great improvements
on this year’s output. The Generals’ young and eager
defense also has to give coach Gary Fallon something
to smile about for next year. The play of
underclassmen like Mike Pressler, Phil Alletto, Gene
Newton, Dave Nichels, Tom Noble like Mike Pressler,
Phil Alletto, Gene Newton, Dave Nichels, Tom Noble
and John Winans was more than impressive and pro-
vides a solid foundation for next year’s squad.

As in the past, the Generals will not lose many
players through graduation. Only five seniors—
Stewart Atkinson, Syd Farrar, Mike Mrlik, Scott
Smith and Joe Wallace—will not return in 1980.
Although this small number should prove beneficial
to next year’s football team, it brings up a problem
that has played the football probram in the past. Out
of God knows how many freshmen players in 1976, on-
ly five stuck with the program the entire four years.
This is a problem that Coach Fallon has hopefully
solved—keeping students interested in the program.

As far as post-season honors go, the Generals plac-
ed three players on the 1979 all-ODAC team: tailback
Stew Atkinson (W&L’s all-time leading rusher and a
three-time all-conference selection), tackle Chip
Nunley (who did an outstanding job of leading the
way on many of Atkinson’s rushes), and senior offen-
sive guard Scott Smith (a repeat all-conference selec-
tion and W&L’s best offensive lineman).

So, with the fall season now complete, Fallon must
look ahead to next year—and what he sees has to im-
press him. He has a storng nucleus of young players
to build upon and enough experienced and talented
upperclassmen to produce a winning season. Of
course, he will need the leadership of tri-captains
Chris Leiser, Lee Minetree and John McKee to hold
the young team together.

With this enthusiastic nucleus coming back in 1980
and another year of experience under their belts, the
outlook for next year’s football team is optimistic.

Have fun during exams and enjoy the holidays!

Generals Show Trend As

Early Season Concludes

by Dale Park

“We played extremely well
together—there were many
positive things happening on the
court.” These are the thoughts
of Head Coach Verne Canfield
on the basketball Generals’
77-47 loss to Roanoke College
last Monday night.

The defeat was the second in
a row for W&L, following an
98-77 loss at Maryville last
Saturday.

As the early part of the season
comes to an end, several
themes in the Generals’ play
have become apparent.

W&L has played four good
games offensively, scoring 88,
91,77, and 67 points.

The offense has been an-
chored by its starting five, or
“blues” as Canfield refers to
them.

“The blues have done a good
job of holding the fort while our
bench matures,”’ said Canfield.

The key to the offensive
punch has been Junior guard
Carby Hoy. Hoy has averaged
22.3 points per game. The

Generals have received an of-
fensive bonus in the overall play
of Junior forward R.J. Scaggs.
Scaggs’ output of 9.5 points and
5 rebounds per game is signifi-
cant in that Scaggs has also
played tough defense against
opponents much bigger than
himself.

 

MAC N

Senior forward Tom Jeffries
has averaged 15.8 points per
game and has played solid
defense as well, his improved
jumping ability a testament to
the team’s off-season weight-
training program.

Senior guard Pete Farrell has
developed into a good floor
leader. The Generals’ captain
has chipped in an average of
15.0 points per game and leads
the team in assists.

Rob Smitherman, the ‘‘blues”’
final man, has averaged 6.5
points per game. The Junior
center is second on his team in
rebounds, averaging 9 per
game to Jeffries’ 11.

“The team is right where we
expected development-wise,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘As the season
develops our depth will im-
prove.”

Some signs of improvement
were evident in the Roanoke
game. Freshman forward
Brian Hansen entered the game
in only the first five minutes.
Hansen finished with four
points, but more importantly
played tenacious defense and
showed good court awareness.

Another force off the bench
was sophomore guard Clark
New. New socred eight points in
two spurts and gave the team
an offensive lift from the out-
side.

The Generais’ R.J. Scaggs (left) goes up for a jump shot against Roanoke College. Later, junior guard

Carby Hoy (right) hits for two points in the losing effort.

“Now we're waiting for
Travis (Patterson, sophomore
forward) and George (Spears,
sophomore guard) to join New
as a unit to supplement the
starting five,’’ said Canfield.

The first four games of the
season have given the Generals
the opportunity to see where
their strengths and weakensses
are.

The season now moves to the
ODAC, and the Generals’
defense will need to tighten up.
W&L gave up an un-
characteristically high 75 and
76 points in its opening wins
over Southeastern and Bowie
State, as well as 89 and 77 points
in the ensuing losses.

The basic problem for the
Generals has been stopping the
big men inside. Bowie State’s
Charles Jackson scored 38
points almost entirely from
within ten feet, and three
Roanoke big men, all over 6’4’’,
scored a combined 49 points.

“By the time we play
Roanoke again the depth will be
there,” said Canfield. ‘The
team has lots of pride and we’ve
been guarding against any let-
downs by practicing on the day
of the game.”’

Far from the time to panic,
the Roanoke loss showed a W&L
team that was poised and
should keep on improving as the
season progresses.

In Overtime Thriller

“We shot horrendously, but
one our good sustained defense
pulled us through,” said W&L
basketball Coach Verne Can-
field. Canfield’s Generals over-
came a poor shooting night and
physical fatigue to defeat
Hampden-Sydney, 56-55 last
night in an overtime contest in
Warner Center.

The win was important as it
was the Generals’ first ODAC
conference game of the season
and raised the team’s overall
record to 3-2.

The ‘‘blues”, the Generals’
starting five, looked sluggish i;
the opening minutes of the
game, as W&L fell behind 10-5.
But the Generals got a short-
lived lift from their bench.

Sophomore guard-forward
Clark New and freshman center
Brian Hanson checked into the
game and each popped in a
quick basket. On the night,
xowever, the W&L bench con-
tributed only five points, a fact
which became more significant
as the starting five became
more fatigued.

Yet the Generals’ offense
ame back to life with almost
eight and a half minutes left in
the first half. ‘“‘When we play
well, five men are moving on
the court and we’re freeing Car-
by (Hoy) to shoot,” said Can-
field.

For almost thirteen straight
minutes of the first half, the
Generals did just that. Led by
Hoy, a junior guard, W&L
outscored the Tigers 21-6 to
open up a 27-16 lead with 3:30
left in the half.

The Generals played good
transition ball for the remainer
of the half. Combined with
tough defense and rebcunding,
the Generals took a 30-22
halftime lead.

Although the Generals had
the lead, missed opportunities
would later come back to haunt
them. W&L shot only 58% from
the free-throw line, a factor that
was especially evident as the
game went into overtime.

   

the second half belonged almost
exclusively to Sydney. Led by
Senior center Ed owens, Sydney
outscored the Generals 20-8 and
pulled into a 43-43 tie with seven
minutes left.

Each team committed a
series of turnovers, including
one stretch of four in a row.

Again, it was Hoy who kept
the Generals close. Hoy scored
six points in the closing seven
minutes, including an _ im-
pressive three point play at 5:50
that brought W&L into a 47-47
tie.

“Everyone contributed to

some extent,” said Canfield.
“Pete (Farrell) and R.J.
(Scaggs) were good floor
leaders for us.”’

Led by two timely baskets by
Farrell and one by Scaggs,
regulation play ended in a 53-53

W&L’s leading scorer, Carby Hoy, looks to pass off in overtime

deadlock.

For the third time in the
game, it was Carby Hoy who
rose to the occasion. Hoy scored
four key points in overtime and
finished the game with a total of
24.

Yet down the’ stretch, the
Generals missed two one-and-
one free throw opportunities
with only a minute and a half
left in the game. The victory
was nailed down until Tom Jef-
fries stole the ball with seconds

left.

This Saturday, the Generals
will take on Shenandoah Col-
lege. Canfield described
Shenandoah as ‘a team with
good individual talent, good
speed, and that plays a physical
game.”

Gametime is 9:00 P.M. at
Warner Center.

Season’s Greetings

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t Sports Editor

“Tis is the season to be jolly.’’ But in the world of
sports, it is also the season to be humble. Here are
some thoughts I’ve collected during this period of
good tidings. So enjoy them and please pass the hum-
ble pie.

— Yes, Virginia, there is life after Woody Hayes. Earl
Bruce gets my vote for Coach of the Year for making
it possible to watch Ohio State without being bored to.
tears. In that same line of thinking, wasn’t it fun to
see Bo Schembechler fall flat on his fact three times
on national T.V. The Buckeyes, scoffed at by most of
the media folk in preseason reports, will go to
Pasedena. Meanwhile, the Wolverines get to play ina
second rate bowl. At least Bo can watch O.S.U. on
New Year’s Day.

—Speaking of Sports Illustrated, how in the name of
Adolph Rupp can they rank Kentucky 18th and
Brigham Young in the top ten? B.Y.U. plays in the
Western Athletic Conference, which is the same as
playing with a bunch of mountain goats. U.K. plays in
the S.E.C., probably the third toughest conference in
the nation.

—Looking at the bowl games, can you believe they’re
allowing Florida State on the same field with
Oklahoma. Somebody might get hurt — and it won’t
be the Sooners. But seriously, the game should be
close — until Billy Sims gets the ball. The Seminoles’
defense would stand a better chance wrestling an
Alligator.

—Also of collegiate interest, Bo Rein of N.C. State is
the latest man to try to turn around the fortunes of
L.S.U. Poor Charlie McClendon; his only fault was he
couldn’t be ‘“‘Bama.”’ Unfortunately, Rein will soon
find himself in the same boat — unless the Bear
decides to go into a hibernation from football. By the
way, I’ll give you a nickel for all the teams Alabama
played this year that are going to a bowl.

—In pro hoops, wha has happened to the once mighty
Washington Bullets? For one thing, they’re in the
same division as Larry Bird. If the Celtics make the

playoffs, Mr. Bird gets my vote for Rookie of the
Year. Sorry, Magic.

—Would somebody please send a Fleet’s Enema to
Mr. Thomas Henderson. c/o Dallas, Texas. Let me
tell you, the guy has diarrhea of the mouth. I can’t
help but laugh when Hollywood says he ‘“used’’ the
Cowboys. Henderson has lost the chance to make
megabucks for playing football. And besides, he’ll be
of no interest in a couple of years. If you still don’t
believe me, look at the awesome careers Jim Brown
and Joe Namath.

—In pro-hockey, where did the Islanders go? Maybe
they burned themselves out last year against the
Rangers. And how about those Flyers. By the way,
you get another nickel if you can name the last time
Marcel Dionne was shut out.

—When will Dick Miller or whoever is in charge of the
gym realize that we need more racquetball courts?
One solution is to convert one (maybe two) of the
handball courts. Let’s face it, people aren’t exactly
knocking down the walls to play handball.

—One last thought. By logic of association, the
basketball Generals have played two teams in the top
20 of Division I. Remember Bowie State? They played
Georgetown 19th in the AP Poll) and lost by 41.
Randolph-Macon, a team we play on February 14,
plays Virginia (No. 13 by the AP vote).

Grapplers Lose To VMI | Remillard Gets
In Season Opener 39-14

by Chris Sisto
Last Saturday, the varsity
wrestling squad opened its dual
meet season with losses to VMI
(39-14) and Carson Newman
(43-3).

Against VMI, the Generals
were stopped in the first four
matches until captain Ray
Gross won at the 142 weight
pound class. Other winners
against VMI _ included
sophomore Mike McFadden at
158 and junior Les Heart at 177.
The only winner against Carson
Newman was Gross who won on

I gave them that changed the
whole tone,’’ said Dashiell.

The first story to come over

the wires — the one Dashiell
first called in — read:
About 300 people, most of them believed
to be Washington and Lee University
students, marched through Lexington
streets tonight in an anti-Iran
demonstration.

The demonstrators met on the W&L
campus, burned an Iranian flag and
several effigies of the Ayatollah Kho-
meini, the Moslem religious leader and
ruler of Iran. The demonstrators then
moved through the streets, chanting
anti-Iranian slogans

They gathered in front of the
Rockbridge County jail about 10:30
p.m., demanding the release of a
demonstrator who had been arrested.

This report came out at 10:49!
p.m.

Later, more reports were

called in to the wire service, but
not all by Dashiell. The later
story read:

Washington and Lee students have ex
pressed their disgust with the situation
in Iran, About 300 demonstrators turn
ed into a screaming, angry torch
bearing mob last night as they marched
through Lexington and onto — the
neighboring VMI campus. They burned
an Iranian flag and effigies of the
Ayatollah Khomeini. They waited and
chanted outside the Rockbridge County
jail until an arrested protester was
released. The protesters tried to take
over W&L’s radio station WLUR bul
were pacified after the news director
read them an Associated Press report

on their protest

A later report said, ‘Four sta-
tion staffers barricaded
themselves in the studio.”’

‘All they did was lock the
door,’’ said Dashiell. He said he
told the AP the same thing;
they chose to use the word “‘bar-
ricade.”’

This season the Generals are
under the direction of six year
Head Coach Gary Franke. He
has had a winning season in
each of his years at W&L. His
teams have also not lost an
ODAC dual meet and have cap-
tured the league crown the last
four years.

Returning from last year’s
team aside from Gross, Heart,
and McFadden are Elbert

senior Joe Wallace, who

Dan Weiss, who was at the
station at the time of the ‘‘take-
over,’’ said the crowd was
spirited, wanted recognition,
and wanted to hear ‘The Star-
Spangled Banner.”’ Both he and
Bill Parks, who was also at the
station at the time, said they
never felt they were in any
danger.

One reporter said the crowd
was yelling and screaming.
Another, from Roanoke, said he
thought the crowd behaved like
what he would call a mob. Ac-
cording to AP reports Wednes-
day afternoon, Dashiell called it
‘‘a group of concerned people”’
and officials at W&L and VMI
said the demonstration “made
a lot of noise but wasn’t a
serious happening.”’

Lexington Chief of Police
James A. Kirby said it could
have been serious if it had got-
ten out of hand, according to AP
reports.

Accounts of the same event
vary with each reporter. One
man’s screaming mob becomes
another's group of concerned

Witness acounts of the torch-
bearing mob cites the mob as
bearing three to ten torches.

Wire reports vary the number
of participants from several
hundred to a few hundred, from
200 to 300 to 400.

The Generals finished in third
place. Competition lasts all day,
with the finals beginning at

spirited crowd is not an angry,
screaming mob. But who is to
say which is more accurate?

Most students at W&L have
their own conceptions of what
occurred Tuesday night. Com-
ments about the crowd range
from calling it “students show-
ing loyalty” to “misdirected
Christmas carollers.”’

Nobody’s perceptions will
ever agree exactly. But by see-
ing how an event one is familiar
with is perceived by others, and
how that perception can
become the reality for those
who were not involved but who
must rely on other’s reports,
one can see the problems in
reporting events accurately and
the danger of relying on one
source of information.

 

 

 

Chairmanship

Page Remillard, Washington
and Lee University aquatics
director, has been appointed
Southeastern Area Chairman
for the U.S.A. Water Polo Cor-
poration (USAWPC), governing
body for amateur water polo
and organizer of the 1980 U.S.
Olympic squad. The appoint-
ment was made at the USAWPC
convention, held in Las Vegas
this past weekend.

“The appointment is ex-
tremely satisfying since a per-
sonal goal has been to help the
growth of water polo in the
eastern half of the country,”
Remillard stated. ‘This is an
indication that the USAWPC
recognized the sport’s growth in
the East.”

As Area Chairman for the 10-
state Southeastern region,
Remillard and a staff of four
are charged with selecting eight
play players and a pair of
coaches to attend the Junior Na-
tional Team Trials, scheduled
for June, 1980 in Colorado
Springs. Players selected will
come from high schools and col-

leges located in the region and
must have been born after
January 1, 1961.

“The USAWPC has designed
the Junior Nationals to be the
starting ground for future
Olympic teams,” Remillard ex-
plained. “If an athlete is in-
terested in Olympic competi-
tion, the trials are the place to
begin.

“We'll be canvassing the
Southeast for the top players
and swimmers,” Remillard
continued. ‘“‘Specifically, we’ll
be looking for excellent swim-
mers. Speed and condition are
key requirements, with cutoffs
at 23.5 for the 50 free and 52.5 for
the 100 free.’’

Remillard, 32, recently
returned from the NCAA Water
Polo Championships of Nov.
24-25. His 1979 W&L team com-
peted at the NCAA Eastern
Regionals in Chicago and finish-
ed the season with a 20-7 reocrd,
In addition to his W&L duties,
he serves on the NCAA Swimm-
ing Rules Committee.

a decline in the number of stu-
dent majors over the past few
years make it necessary for the
English Department to contract
rather than expand at this time.

Coulling believes the tenure
system is a ‘double-edged
sword,” adding that ‘‘it protects
and hurts”’ instructors. Coulling
maintains that the academic
freedom afforded by tenure is a
necessity, judging that there ‘‘is
no full and systematic alter-
native,” but recognizes that
there are ‘‘exceptionally able
people (presently teaching at
W&L) and we cannot per-
manently retain them; if I hada
future position open I would be
delighted to vote for tenure.”

Citing rapid expansion in the
1960’s, Coulling blames
graduate schools as_ the
“villains”’ for. turning out too
many Ph.D’s and creating a
glut of qualified instructors on

the teaching job market.

Ms. Kaston explains that
while her situation is “regret-
ful,’ she believes that the
Department has handled it in
the best way ‘by making us
aware of the situation from the
start.”” John Swift adds that
tenure is “more complicated
than it looks,’’ because the
faculty must continually
“balance a variety of in-
terests.”’

Swift believes that any pro-
blems associated with tenure
are aggravated by the fact that
‘humanities divisions are not
growing,” for which he says the
current teaching job market
and declining college job
markets are to blame. These
problems are “not unique to
Washington and Lee and will
not be alleviated for a good long
time,’”’ explains Swift, adding
that to the best of his knowledge
only one instructor has received

ment at the University of
Virginia, where he taught for
three years as a graduate in-
structor, since 1975.

Associate Professor Robert
Fure is not as supportive in his
evaluation of the tenure system.

-Fure finds his experiences with

tenure to be ‘‘frustrating to the
young professional’ and a
“threat to his career.” Fure ex-
plains that other universities
will be less inclined to hire him
knowing that they will have less
time to decide whether to award
him tenure. ‘I cannot stay here
because I must find another
position at a university where I
will have enough time to
demonstrate my competance as
a teacher and a scholar.”’

Fure is very familar with the
working of the tenure system,
having brought a suit against

Northern Michigan University
as an undergraduate student on
behalf of a professor who was
“capriciously denied tenure”’
by the University’s president.
With the aid of the American
Civil Liberties Union, Fure won
his case and the university
president resigned.

In contrast, Fure points out
that he has been “happy with

teaching climate has _ been
wonderful, but the tenure
system has interferred with our
relationship.’’ Fure adds that
teaching unions could provide
solutions to many of the pro-
blems posed by the tenure
system. Teaching unions, Fure
believes, would ‘‘offer all
teachers protection, assure de-
cent salaries and_ protect
younger faculty members,’’
adding that under the present
tenure system junior faculty
members have ‘‘nothing to pro-
tect their interests other than
the beneficence of the Ad-
ministration.”

While the three faculty
members concerned offer dif-:

ferent evaluations of the tenure.

system, they will all continue to

‘

seek a tenure appointments if

not at Washington and Lee, then
somewhere else. As Robert:
Fure puts it, ‘we can stay here
but it’s not in our best interest.” -

Discrimination
Charged At

Princeton

A number of Princeton University’s female
professors are charging discrimination in the
manner in which tenure is granted there.
Tenure virtually assures job security because
the procedure involved in firing a tenured
professor is complicated and rarely suc-
cessfully implemented.

Of Princeton’s 390 tenured professors, only
10, or 2.5 percent, are women. But Princeton
is not alone among prestigious private univer-
sities with few tenured women professors.
Twelve (three percent) of Harvard Universi-
ty’s 364-member tenured faculty are women.
At the University of Pennsylvania, 81 of the
school’s 965 tenured professors, or 8.5 per-
cent, are women, according to a report in the
Washington Post.

Comparatively, all-male Washington and
Lee University has granted tenure to two of
its five female professors. In all, 115 of the
155-member faculty at W&L have tenure.

Throughout the country, almost 70 percent
of all male professors have tenure, while less
than half of the female professors in the U.S.
have been given job security, according to a
1978-79 report by the American Association of
University Professors.

‘‘We suspect that women are being held to a
stricter performance level in the tenure pro-
cess,’’ says Dr. Lilli Hornig, director of the
Higher Education Resource Services at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts. ‘‘Their
right to be in the university at all is still being
challenged.”

“There is evidence that women who have a
research commitment to women’s studies are
taken very lightly in the tenure process,”
Hornig told the Post.

At Princeton, associate professor of
classics Janet Martin resigned her position as
chairman of the soman’s studies committee
“because it became clear to me _ that
Princeton had no commitment to women’s
studies or the tenuring of women except in
token numbers.”’

Martin and several of her colleagues have

compiled statistics that they say demonstrate
that Princeton discriminates against female
professors :

Faculty Dean Aaron Lemonick said that
Princeton is not sexist in its tenure decisions.
“To say that we discriminate is ridiculous,”
he said. ‘‘It is simply very difficult for anyone
to get tenure in a time when our
demographics show that the university will
not be expanding very much in the near
future. Women and minorities entered the
academic fields after the expansion period of
the 1960s,’’ Lemonick said.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Security, Again

Frankly, there isn’t much more that we can do.
We’ve reported on crimes against students, documen-
ting that vandalism and burglary in Lexington are in-
deed on the increase. We’ve published articles on
what you can do to protect your property. We’ve prod-
ded the student body Executive Committee to look in-
to the problems of providing security for Washington
and Lee students. But it hasn’t seemed to have done
much good.

The two main problems here are that W&L students
are vulnerable — we leave our valuable possessions
behind when we go home for vacation — and that pet-
ty crimes by youngsters in rural areas are increasing
all over the country.

Property theft in rural areas like Lexington have
gone up 916 percent in the last 20 years, according to
statistics compiled by the National Rural Crime
Prevention Center at Ohio State University. When the
Center studied youngsters in rural Ohio last year,
they were surprised to find that more than half the
teenagers admitted to committing some type of van-
dalism.

Until a better solution can be found, we can only
urge our our student readers to exercise common
sense precaution: hide or take home all valuables ;
lock everything; and note all serial numbers on
stereos, cameras, etc. left behind over vacation.

Fraternity houses are routinely ransacked during

On The Rally

At a time when the student body Executive Com-
mittee is working to get both the townspeople and the
faculty to take Washington and Lee’s students more
seriously, Tuesday night’s rally against Iran could
not have been more inopportune. Besides doing
nothing to solve American Foreign policy problems,
the rally and its subsequent march on the town only
demonstrated once again how immature many
students at this university really are.

Let’s face it. The rally was just a good chance to
‘get drunk and have a good time raising hell,’’ as one
participant so articulately put it.

The actions of the ralliers really deserve no further
space here except to say that Tuesday night was a
stupid and inane outburst of misdirected emotions
and energies.

Letters To The Editor
Disagreeing With Colvin’s SALT Stance

Dear Sir:

I regret that I was unable to
attend Dr. Colvin’s presentation
on the SALT II treaty. While I
do not agree with his position on
ratification and can comment
only on the points set forth in
the 15 November RTP, it is
gratifying to know that there is
interest in a treaty which will
shape the future relations bet-
ween the United States and the
Soviet Union regardless of the
final Senate action.

Dr. Colvin makes a good case,
but there are two points which I
take issue with. First, the
Backfire bomber. It would be a
mistake to ignore this weapon
system even though according
to Dr. Colvin it “has a range of
5,000 miles and therefore could
not strike the United States and
return to Russia.”

I question the 5,000 mile range
because it has been placed at
6,500 by several authorities. No
matter. It has an_ in-flight

Ambulance

Call
Unheeded

Dear Editor:

I would like to make you
aware of a discouraging inci-
dent I witnessed last Saturday
night.

Some friends of mine and I
were walking along Jefferson
Street with our dates when one
of the girls stepped off a curb
and apparently broke her ankle
or her leg. After we discovered
that she was in too much pain to
be moved, someone phoned in a
request for an ambulance.

During the substantial wait
which followed we did all we
could to comfort her, keeping
her warm, for she showed some
symptoms of being in shock,
and trying to calm her, for she
was writhing in pain. Another
call was placed for an am-
bulance and then another.

Only after the fourth phone
call and an estimated wait of

refueling capability and could

delivering nuclear weapons on
targets in the United States.

Further, in case of war, it is
not at all unreasonable to ex-
pect assignments of one way
missions by the Soviet military
leaders if the situation so
demanded. I have friends who
were naval aviators and would
have volunteered for such a
mission if the call had gone out.
It is most likely the Soviets have
aviators who would do the
same.

the outcome of two confronta-
tions would have been quite dif-
ferent had the United States not
had strategic superiority. I cite
the Cuban missile crisis when
the Russina ships, enroute to
Cuba, reversed course on the
high seas when confronted by
the U.S. Navy.

The October 1973 crisis inci-
dent to the Yom Kippur War

Nixon ordered the world-wide

the Russians gave indications of
deploying airborne troops to the
Middle East. While conven-
tional forces played a large role

Opinion :

The Rights Of Others

Boy, it’s good to see that Washington and Lee men have got what
it takes. We’ve shown that we can sink as low as any other students
in the country.

The holding of an anti-Iran ‘‘rally,” and the submerged concepts
that lie behind it, show how easily we forget the supposed dif-
ferences between the United States and nations like Iran.

The cries of ‘‘Kill Khomeini”’ and ‘‘Nuke Iran”’ should not be seen
as a positive reflection of unity among the student body. The
mindless call for military force is not an encouraging sign coming
from the students of one of the finer liberal arts institutions in the
country.

While it probably would make us all feel better to torch a few tur-
bans, there should be a recognition, by those of us lucky enough to
be exposed to higher education in an open society, of the differences
between responsible action and simply satisfying action.

An open society allows the voicing of all opinions. At the same
time, however, there must be a recognition and securing of the
right for each opinion to exist. When, in times of stress, the call
goes out for the suppression of these rights, it must be resisted even
at the cost of allowing one’s opponents a voice.

An anti-Iranian “rally’’ might well be in most Americans’ in-
terst, but it also serves a more insidious function—it is a sign to
Washington that even the allegedly most tolerant and educated seg-
ment of society supports repressive measures within its borders.
The selective enforcement of deportation laws against a specific
part of society is a dangerous precedent that supposedly was
regretted after the harsh treatment of Japanese-American citizens
during World War II. While Iranian students obviously are not U.S.
citizens, the principles against selective enforcement of laws still
holds true.

A better way to show our concern about the present situation
would be to show our support for United Nations action and the safe
return of the hostages. Until such time as the captives are secured,
or all diplomatic attempts are exhausted, in which case a virtual if
unannounced state of war would exist, the call for military action
should be resisted. In any case, the protection of the rights of those
within our borders should never be subjected to the currents of pas-
sion. :

 
 

 

Coeducation: Debate Before Vote |

Dear Editor:

This year’s agenda to sweep the coeducation
question back under the rug looks like that of
years past. A pop quiz or poll is taken, without
much announcement, asking whether or not
students would favor having women at W&L. As I
can remember, the results are usually pretty
much split down the middle with some years
favoring it and some not, but only by a small
margin.

What the usual process of evaluating student
opinion on coeducation lacks is having a more
open debate on campus of the issue before a poll is
taken instead of afterwards.

When the question of coeducation was mention-
ed in the last Phi, the E.C. said a poll would be
taken to determine whether a study is warranted.
It seems, however, that in the face of good ‘ole
Washington and Lee apathy, not only will the poll
be poorly attended, it will also reflect the general
ignorance of the students as to what the positive
effects of coeducation could be.

The result is the same old stalemate which in
my mind is another example of how this communi-
ty seems to skillfully ignore most questions of
social importance. I find this kind of removal not
only stifling but also detrimental to a person’s
growth. I do see this as a problem, but not
necessarily isolated to Washington and Lee.

The more I think about the ‘‘apathy”’ problem
the more it perplexes me. Anyone who has spent
time at this school is perfectly aware of how dif-

Mocking The Choice

ficult it is to spark interest in people for anything
besides partying.

I feel Washington and Lee is a most unique
school, though not because it is single sex, but that
it could be so much better. Someone said to me
‘Look, many people here have a simple mind and
they don’t want to be confused with anything out-
side of just functioning day-to-day. It would con-
fuse their lives.’’ I can’t believe that this has to be
the rule. Must people always simply accept the
situation they’re set into even though they can ef-
fect a change which would expand and improve
their lives?

This again brings me to the issue of coeducation,
a change which I think could do just that for this
school and the students and faculty here.

People say ‘‘but it would change this school so
much it wouldn’t be the same.”’ For reasons I will
not go into here, I feel that the change would not be
detrimental at all.

Instead, of destroying the unique character of
the school it would enhance it.

If it is so important that W&L preserve its role
as a single sex institution, or maintain its tradition
as such, I would like to hear some good arguments
that present this as being positive and healthy.

But I emphasize that this type of public debate
should reach a healthy level before the E.C. takes
a poll so that people might be aware of the possible
effects (and I grant that you can argue them good
or bad) that coeducation may have at W&L.

Thank you for reading this.

Letters To The Editor

Manipulation

Dear Editor,

I should like to address this to
any rational minds at W&L who
care to listen. A private White
House memo from President
Carter’s chief domestic ad-
visor, Stuart Eizenstat, recent-
ly leaked to the Washington
Post. This memo eloquently
reveals the true nature of that
government which we: created
to protect individual rights to
“life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness’? more clearly than
anything since Nixon recorded
his criminal plots.

“With strong steps we can
mobilize the nation around a
real crisis and with a clear
enemy-OPEC,”’ read the memo.
It went on to say, ‘‘We have a
better opportunity than ever
before to assert leadership over
an apparently insoluble pro-
blem, to shift the cause for in-
flation and energy problems to
OPEC to gain credibility with
American people,...to regain
political losses.’’ The purpose of
such actions? ‘‘To buy us a
week or so before the public will
expect more specifics.”’

 

“To shift the cause’? Wishful
thinking, but the true cause of
any state of affairs is an objec-
tive reality; one may shift it in
writing, but not in fact. And the
fact is that the mind-boggling
(and economy-wrecking)
system of state planning,
regulation, and manipulation is
simply breaking down. ‘‘To buy
us a week or so ?”’ It seems that
the individuals who constitute
‘the public’ are viewed by our
government as foes to be out-
witted, rather than masters to
be served. And the politicians,
helpless in the face of a self-
created crisis, are desperately
trying to protect themselves by
clouding the facts and real
issues in the minds of
Americans with a flurry of false
accusations, public displays of
“concern,” and, of course,
more massive government pro-
grams to prove that they are
“taking action.”’

But that is only the Ad-
ministration, some argue, there
is always Congress. Well, as
Eizenstat points out, ‘‘Congress
is growing more nervous by the
day over the energy problem.

Of Sen. Goldwater

For The Convention

Dear Editor:

Regarding the lead article to
the November 1979 Mock Con-
vention Report: In no way do I
intend to criticize the tri-
chairmen of the Mock Conven-
tion. I believe that their choice
of Sen. Barry Goldwater as
keynote speaker is excellent,
for the Senator is indeed
representative of the
Republican Party. That
Goldwater is patriarch of the
GOP reveals the depths to
which the party has sunk since
the resignation of its “fallen
hero’’, Dick Nixon.

Yes, Washington and Lee is
familiar territory to the Arizona
Senator. I hope W&L will be just
as familiar to Gov. Reagan
when he comes as the keynote
speaker to the 1996 Republican
Mock Convention. I also hope
that our student delegates cor-
rectly predict that the Governor
be selected as his party’s
nominee, No doubt, he will be
able to fill Goldwater’s shoes
and follow the same path to
defeat in November.

Isn’t it amazing how ‘“‘sym-
pathy for the Democratic party
and its fallen hero, John Ken-
nedy, as well as the challenge of
upsetting a powerful incumbent
in Lyndon Johnson”’ is to blame
for the Senator’s defeat. None
dare think that Goldwater’s ad-
vocating “basic and extremely
conservative — themes time
and time again’ led to his
political defeat.

How _ interesting that the
Senator predicted during the
1964 campaign the immorality

that would ‘run rampant in the
government”’ of Richard Nix-
on! How did Sen. Goldwater
ever guess that Nixon’s federal
government would meddle in
the “private affairs’ of the
Democratic party —
Watergate, and in those of
many anti-war activists? The
Senator even foretold Nixon’s
appeasement of the COM-
MUNISTS in Vietnam and the
failure of ‘peace with honor’.
What a brilliant man!

If only the Blacks in the
South, Indians on the reserva-
tions, and Hispanics in the
Southwest had realized to what
extent the Senator was
dedicated to ‘‘individual
freedoms”, the GOP might
have gone on to victory in 1964,
Alas! — his “honesty” and ‘‘un-
popular stands’ have allowed
him to become ‘‘patriarch of the
Republican party”, America’s
minority party. Is it any reason
why?

One can “‘sagely reflect’’ that
this “popular” politician of
THE elitist GOP mades a great
choice for keynote speaker to
join the ranks of those honored
men who have spoken here
before him. I can only add that
we liberal Democrats, although

we be very few, will not extend.

the rude welcome to Sen.
Goldwater that conservative
Republicans extended to our
keynote speaker, Sen. William
Proxmire, in 1976. Finally, may
all future Washington and Lee

Mock Conventions be
Republican! !

Mary Baldwin Responds

To the Editor:

The following letter is aimed specifically at the
author of the article entitled ‘Regardless of
Scorn: A Freshman’s Guide to Surrounding Girl's
Schools,” which appeared in the Ring-tum Phi on
October 18, 1979, and those who may share his
point of view.

We have read the unsigned comments about
Mary Baldwin College and the young women here,
We could respond with counter charges and name
calling ;-we could point out the inconsistencies and
contradictions in statement of fact; we could la-
ment the ignorance of the author of the article who
apparently does not know that the parietals at
Mary Baldwin are in accordance with state law:
or, we could object to being called “‘targets.”’ A
more appropriate response however, can be found
in the real issue which underlies the article. And
the issue is not Mary Baldwin College. The issue,
as we see it, is the author’s assumption that the

world is (or should be) created for his own per-
sonal convenience, additionally, the notion that
personal gratification is the sole object of his
social interests.

The author states that our security needs to be
“beefed up,’’ yet at the same time he finds many
security procedures to be too much trouble and un-
comfortable for him. How confusing! “Even the
landscape is deficient’’? We suspect it is when one
is traveling through it at 3:00 a.m. So, what we
have to say, we will ask Robert E. Lee to say in
this sentence from a letter to his wife dated Oc-
tober 1867, Lexington, Virginia. ‘‘We have nearly
400 students at W. College and they all seem to be
ardently pursuing their studies.’’ We might add,
‘Regardless of Scorn.”

The issue of the draft is an issue of
rights. Philosophically, rights are condi-
tions of existence required by man’s
nature for his survival qua man. If man
is to live; then it is right that he must use
his mind, it is right that he must work to
produce his chosen values and dispose of
them as he sees fit in order to sustain his
life. A man and his life are identical, thus
man’s life is his by right-by his nature.
The single fundamental right, the right to
life, is the source of all others rights; and
their only implementation is the right to
one’s property, without which no rights
are possible. For man must sustain his
life by his effort; the man who has no
right to the product of his effort has no
means to sustain his life. Note that rights
pertain only to action, and only in-
divuduals act. Therefore rights pertain
only to individuals.

 

Kim Sawyer is a sophmore at
Washington and is a member of
Students for a Libertarian Society.

Should Selective Service Be

The Draft Is A Violation Of Human Rights

Others offer the ‘“‘public welfare’’ or
the “good of society” in support of the
draft (or some form of compulsory civil
service). There is no such entity as
“‘society,’’ since society is only a number
of individuals. Thus the ‘‘good of society”’
is simply the good of each individual. But
the good of an individual is a matter of

called ‘‘public welfare;’’ yet 4-10 billion
dollars is too much to spend on saving
American youths from the mangling,
brutalizing psychological — if not
physical — torture of war.

The practical question of the country’s
protection is not the real issue at hand.

 

As long as our government has the power to force
us to do anything except to refrain from violating

the rights of others, then the idea of a government

of the people is an empty myth.

 

 

Politically, a right is a moral premise
— a recognition of a fact of nature —
which defines and sanctions a man’s
freedom of action in a social context.
Rights, as such, impose no obligation on
others except not to violate those rights.
A crime is the violation of an individual’s
rights. Rights deal with action; human
action presupposes choice; and only
physical force and fraud are capable of
nullifying human choices. Therefore, to
violate a man’s rights is to use coersion
or fraud to compel him to act against his
judgement or to expropriate his proper-
ty. The only fundamental premise of a
moral political philosophy is that no man
or group of men may initiate such ag-
gression against the person or property
of another.

Individual rights supercede any
‘‘public’”’ or ‘‘social’’ concerns because
these rights are essential to the existence
of individual men, without whom neither
public nor society would exist. Since
rights pertain only to individuals, socie-
ty, a such, can have no rights; therefore,
the only moral justification for any law
or government is to protect individual
rights.

Our government, created solely to pro-
tect each individual’s right to live his life
as he so chooses, has today become the
biggest single violator of that right this
nation has ever known. The paradigm ex-
ample of this fact is the draft. Of all the
criminal acts perpetrated by our govern-
ments, the most evil is the draft. It
negates all of man’s rights at their very
source — his right to life — and eloquent-
ly illustrates the fundamental premise of
statism: that man’s life belongs to the
state and is simply leased out to him until
such time as. the state decides to con-
sume it. There is a name for ‘“‘an animal
which devours its own kind’’ — cannibal
(Webster’s).

A volunteer army is the only proper,
moral, and constitutional way to defend a
country. This is also most practical. No
one will fight better than those men and
women who have willfully ‘chosen
soldiering as their career. But some
argue, ‘‘what if we cannot find enough
volunteers?’’ If a government under-
takes to fight a war for other than self-
defense, then, true, it will not find many
volunteers — fortunately and rightfully
so. Moreover, there are not many men
(or women) who would not fight willingly
to protect their lives, property, and loved
ones from invaders. (Why, then, will they
not fight to protect the same from the
state?)

choice. Therefore no act which violates
individual rights can claim as a justifica-
tion “the good of society.” Another
variant of this argument is the use of
“national defense’’ to justify conscrip-
tion. True, the only justifiable use of
force is in self-defense (against the
criminal), but the idea of a government

When a principle such as that behind the
draft is accepted, even implicitly, it does
not take long to become explicit. The
government is always quick to find other
advantages in its logical implications.
For instance, during World War II, the
military draft was used as a justification
for proposals to establish compulsory

Americans. But the statists are struggl-
ing not to give up the power it gives them
in the form of an unnamed principle (and
precedent) — that man’s life is the pro-
perty of the government.

U.S. mobilization plans call for im-
mediate resumption of conscription upon
the outbreak of any hostilities involving
the U.S. — anywhere in the world. The
Selective Service Act of 1967 is still in ef-
fect and gives the president the power to
force young Americans away from their
lives and into the armed forces whenever
he so commands. The Selective Service
System stands ready with $8 billion and
plans designed to deliver up to 650,000
American lives to the war machine
within three months of the command.
Thus conscription is very much alive
within our present system, despite the
fact that the government failed in one at-
tempt to reinact the draft this past
September (only after massive
resistance and threats of organized civil
disobedience).

 

 

 

 

 

violating the lives and expropriating the
property of its citizens under the guise ot
protecting those citizens is such a brazen
contradition as to be hardly worth ra-
tional consideration.

Another proffered justification is not
even military, but financial in nature.
The volunteer army would be too costly

labor conscription for the entire’ U.S.
population. If men can be drafted to die,
it was argued, then why can’t they be
drafted to work?: Such totalitarian
powers aS mass slavery are the real
issue. To quote from Lieutenant General
Lewis B. Ramsey, director of the Selec-
tive Service System (June 24, 1966): “‘I
am not concerned with the uncertainty

 

The single principle of libertarianism is that no

man or group of men has the right to agress

against the person or property of another.

 

— $4-10 billion — it is argued. Therefore,
in order that the state gain money, we
are to pay with our lives, not just our ear-
nings. And, even accepting these figures,
compare 4-10 billion dollars to an annual
federal budget of (circa) $459.4 billion
(1978). Note, also, that the government
spends, by far, the largest portion of its
budget on programs directed at the so-

involved in keeping our citizenry believ-
ing that they owe something to their
country. There are too many, too many
people that think that individualism must
be completely recognized, even if group
rights (emphasis mine) go to the devil.”
The motivation behind all of this is glar-
ingly obvious. The draft is not needed for
the protection of the lives and property of

As long as our government has the
power to force us to do a anything except
to refrain from violating the rights of
others, then the idea of a government of
the people is an empty myth, and the
reality is that we are slaves of the state
(fully in principle and nearly so in fact).
We no longer own our lives, and our
“‘freedom”’ has become no more than a
mountain of political rhetoric. As
regards the draft, the issue at stake is
central — our very lives. If you hold
human life (your life) as a value, then
there can be only one moral response.
Abolish the Selective Service System; if
not, the price is high — your life.

Note: I would like to make the follow-
ing statement in order to dispel many
common misconceptions: Liber-
tarianism is a political movement which
has its philosophical roots in the men who

stitution. The single principle of this
movement is that no man or group of

Reinstated In The U.S. ?

Buddy Bowie

The United States Army currently
faces a crisis of such magnitude that its
future as an effective fighting force is in
grave doubt. That crisis is in manpower.
As serious and as pressing as the current
equipment and ammunition shortages
are, by almost universal consent the
single most serious threat to our national
security lies in the shortages and in-
creasingly low quality of our Army’s per-
sonnel.

 

Buddy Bowie is a senior at
Washington & Lee’s R.O.T.C.

program.

 

If current trends continue, the Army
will soon be able to field only a fraction of
the fighting forces deemed minimally ac-
ceptable. This is at a time when world
unrest places increasingly complex
demands on our defense establishment.
The root of these ills can be traced back
to one source — the abysmal failure of
the all volunteer army.

Since its inception in 1973, the all
volunteer army has proven increasingly
unable to meet either the quotas or stan-
dards required to adequately man our ar-
my. Recruiting for fiscal 1979 fell 15,000
men short of its goal, and recent in-
vestigations indicate that as many as
16,000 more recruits may have to be
released because of falsified records or
erroneous enlistments. Put into
managable figures, this is roughly one
and a half divisions out of a standing
force of only 13-14 divisions. An even
more dismal picture is projected by the
state of the Reserve forces, and this is
the area of of our greatest vulnerability.

In the event of war, the regular or stan-
ding army depends on the Reserve com-
ponents for most of its combat service
support and for individual replacement
of casualties. These Reserve components
are made up of both the authorized
reserve units and the IRR, or Individual
Ready Reserve.

Depending on whose figures one is will-
ing to accept, the estimates of the
Reserve’s strength shortage range from
72,000 to upwards of 300,000 men
understrength. Either figure makes our
Reserve forces woefully inadequate for
their task.

A report on the state of our army,
prepared for Sen. R. Beard (R-Tenn.) by
J.L. Reed in 1978, estimates that in event
of wartime mobilization, the army will
be deficient by at least 500,000 personnel
within the first 60 days of hostilities! This

sonnel have a high school diploma, and
the number of these who were passed
merely along for convenience sake is
unknown.

The army divides its personnel into
five categories of testable intelligence: I,
II, IITA, IIIB, and IV. The service does
not accept anyone in division IV and less
than one percent in division I. As of 1978,
the majority of recruits were in division
IIIB and that number is increasing year-

ly.

exactly what it asks for, no more, no less. What

it asks for tends to be a reflection of what it is,’

designed to improve reading
and learning skills in academic
subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-
centration and to deepen
analysis.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
Jan. 14 through Feb. 8. Schedul-
ing will be flexible to ac-
commodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be
small to permit necessary stu-
dent attention. Each student
will attend a total of twenty ses-
sions, five per week. Tuition for
the program will be $65,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.

 

 

 

is close to two-thirds of our total standing
army.

The Beard report goes on to state: ‘‘All
of the deficiencies listed above are a
direct consequence of stopping the draft
and moving to the use of volunteer
labor.”’ All analysts agree that the next
war, due to its ferocity and rapid expen-
diture of highly sophisticated weaponry,
will necessarily be a short one. Obvious-
ly, the outset of hostilities is not the time
to go looking for men — by then it might
be too late.

Unfortunately, the manpower shortage
is not the end of the problem. The quality
of the average recuit is dropping yearly.
Currently, only 56 percent of enlisted per-

The army has already made plans to
downgrade the reading level of manuals
from the 11th grade level to the seventh
grade level. This comes at a time when
new weapons systems are growing ever
more complex and highly technical.
Even the most sophisticated weapon
system is reduced to junk in the hands of
a man incapable of using it to its fullest
advantage.

The current enlisted force does not
reflect a _ realistic cross-section of
American society, either. The over-
whelming majority of personnel reflect
an all too similar background: lower in-
come, working class families, and a
totally disproportionate number of
minorities, especially blacks and

The Army Needs The Draft To Fight Effectively

Hispanics.

A draft would immediately alleviate
these problems by drawing from the
broad base of.the American public and
providing personnel of a diverse and
rounded nature that our army so
desperately needs.

My purpose in this article has not been
to elucidate the many Selective Service
schemes put forward by various
legislators — most of which have great
merit; rather, it has been to demonstrate
the desperate condition of our army and
the pressing need for some form of draft,
immediately.

General Sir John Hackett once wrote,
“What a society gets in its armed ser-
vices is exactly what it asks for, no more
no less. What it asks for tends to be a
reflection of what it is. When a country
looks at its fighting forces, it is looking in
a mirror; if the mirror is 4 true one, the
face that it sees will be its own.”’

The all volunteer army, noble as the
experiment was, has proven a failure. It
has had six years to redeem itself, yet
has only grown steadily worse. We can no
longer afford to gamble with our national
security and a return to some form of the
draft, regretable though it may be, is the
only realistic answer.

It is time we set about making the mir-
ror of our armed forces a ‘“‘true’’ reflec-
tion of American society and spirit. In
the words of George Washington: ‘‘It
may be laid down as a primary position,
and the basis of our system, that every
citizen who enjoys the protection of a free
government, owes not only a proportion
of his property, but even of his personal
services to the defense of it.

‘Sore At City Services

(continued from page 16)

30-40 minutes did the am-
bulance arrive. We were in-
formed that Lexington has only
two volunteer rescue squad
workers on duty, though they
did not state whether that is the
case all the time or only on
Saturday nights.

The thing that makes this
such a sore spot with me is that
I also witnessed the arrest in
September of several students
for playing football on Lee
Avenue. The time spent on this
matter by the police officer in-
volved was approximately 30

minutes.

Another crime I know about,
which occurred during
Thanksgiving vacation, was the
robbery of several pieces of
stereo equipment from a frater-
nity house. In this case, the In-
vestigating officer came the
day after the robbery was

strategic strength which car-
ried the day for us.

I oppose the ratification of the
SALT II treaty for reasons that
have been set forth often in the
media. They are quite involved
and only a listing of a few is
possible in this letter. They in-
clude (1) SALT II locks the
United States into a position of
strategic inferiority, (2) SALT
II makes our people hostages,
(3) SALT II is unverifiable, (4)
SALT II removes the nuclear
shield which used to protect our
allies. There is ample evidence
to support the above points and
others. However, even more
basic, I oppose ratification
because of the lack of trust in
theability of this administration
to negotiate an agreement with
the Soviet Union that enhances
the security of the United
States.

Make no mistake about the
significance of the SALT II trea-
ty. It may be one of the most
pivotal transactions in our na-
tion’s history. For that reason,
it seems important enough to
warrant a full discussion so that
those who will share in the
future of the United States may
hear both sides in the ongoing
debate.

I would hope that a prominent
citizen who opposes the ratifica-
tion of the treaty will be given
the opportunity to address the
issues in the matter. If such
cannot or will not be arranged, |
suggest that those interested
read the statement of Senator
Harry F. Byrd, Jr. in the 30 Ju-
ly 1979 CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD Proceedings «ind
Debates of the 96th Congress,
First Session. It will be time

well spent.

reported and only then after two
phone calls. He had no interest
in seeing the rooms from which
the stereos were stolen, no in-
terest in seeing the door locks
which had been pried open and
no interest in seeing some
evidence which had_ been
carefully set aside so that no
one would touch it. He then took
no notes on what seemed to me
to be some fairly relevent ver-
bal information.

To avoid injecting any un-
necessary emotion, I will end
my story here. My hope is that I
am not alone in feeling that the
set of priorities followed in Lex-
ington on matters such as these
is contrary to the way it should

be.
