4. Frats On Conduct Pro

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee placed four fraternities on
conduct probation until the end
of the school-year for a rule
violation that occurred over
Fancy Dress Weekend.

The Judicial Board of the
Inter-fraternity Council decid-
ed, two weeks ago, not to take
any action against Phi Kappa
Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Beta Theta Pi and Delta Tau
Delta for holding a party that
lasted one hour past the 6 p.m.
deadline established for Sunday
parties.

$110,000 Project

 

 

However, the matter went to
the Student Affairs Committee
last week and SAC initially
placed the fraternities on social
probation for a week which
would have included IFC
weekend this Saturday. The
fraternities appealed the deci-
sion and SAC imposed the con-
duct probation penalty.

All IFC cases are reviewed by
the SAC.

Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, said the conduct pro-
bation means that, if the frater-
nities appear before the IFC or

Plans For W&L

by Randy Smith

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity should build an open-air
pavilion-style facility
somewhere on campus, a
special ad hoc committee has
concluded after almost two
years of studying the proposal.

The W&L pavilion, which
would have about 5,000 square
feet of floor space (about the
size of Evans Dining Hall) and
would be similar in design to the
pavilion at Lake Robertson, is
estimated to cost over $111,000,
according to a_ preliminary
report obtained by The Ring-
tum Phi.

A proposal for a large enclos-
‘ ed structure which could be
heated and used in the winter
was rejected on the basis that it
“could not be justified finan-
cially.”

The pavilion committee,

which is made up of student Ex-
ecutive Committee members,
Student Activities Board of-
ficers, faculty members, and in-
terested students, interviewed
“a cross-section of University
administrators, faculty, and
students, and encountered only
one person who was opposed to
such a facility, and that per-
son’s concern was that the ex-
istance (sic) of a multi-purpose
facility might jeopardize the
fine arts department request
for a new theater.”

According to the report, the
student Executive Committee
has already approved a $5 sur-
charge on the annual student
tax to finance construction of
the pavilion.

Another option for financing
the pavilion was to use the
$13,000 in student money now in
an escrow account to cover

SAC again this year, the con-
duct probation will be taken into
account and the fraternities will
be dealt with more harshly.

John said the SAC does not
have automatic rules for deal-
ing with future violations.

However, he said penalties
would be more severe. The
degree of increased severity
would depend on the cir-
cumstances, John said. The
conduct probation, he said, is
essentially a warning to the
fraternities to watch their
behavior.

members on this committee did
not foresee any problems in us-
ing the money for construction
purposes,”’ the report states.

A third financing alternative
is for the University to pay for
all or part of the construction.

The committee recommend-
ed two possible sites for the long
debated pavilion: the northwest
corner of the upper fields down
the road from the Liberty Hall
ruins where the cross country
course turns into the woods, or
in the ‘‘Pine Forest’’ behind the

advantages for both sites:

EC Recommends Pledge Change

by John Billmyre

A recommendation sug-
gesting fraternity presidents
should not have to pledge that
their houses upheld social pro-
bation was passed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

When a fraternity finishes its
period of social probation, the
Student Affairs Committee re-
quires its president to sign a
statement saying his house
upheld the terms of social pro-
bation.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham said the
practice puts a strain on the
Honor System.

“The pledge puts fraternity
presidents in a bind — they
have a duty to the house and to
the honor system,’’ said
Abraham.

In response to a point made
by another EC member,
Abraham said the SAC pledge
required of fraternity
presidents is different from
other pledges.

“If you do not sign the SAC
pledge, you are assumed guilty,
not innocent,’’ the EC President
said.

Abraham also referred. to
page two of the White Book,
which says, “The Executive
Committee earnestly
discourages the use of pledges
in all matters of minor concern,
The use of a man’s word of
honor to regulate trivialities is
dangerous and should oertanaly
be avoided.”

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg agreed _ with
Abraham that the pledge should
not be used for trivial matters,

but said ‘‘The same trust that is
given by the faculty that allows
someone to sign a pledge is the
reason you (EC members in
favor of the recommendation)
want to do without the pledge.”’

After the meeting Blumberg,
who voted in favor of the recom-
mendation, said ‘Abraham
dominated the discussion of the
recommendation.”

Discussion on the problem
with pledges also drifted into
discussion of a situation at the
law school where a professor
uses a pledge to check class at-
tendance.

Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative, suggested the
EC stick to the problem with the
SAC pledge.

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould opposed early

SCA Helps

A new organization in the
University Federation called
Students for Community Action
(SCA) has formed at W&L.

As the name suggests, the
organization seeks to provide a
means by which students can
actively participate in com-
munity service, providing both
skilled and unskilled labor to
repair the homes of low-income
families.

SCA works in conjunction
with Total Action Against
Poverty (TAP), a Federally
funded organization. TAP
locates those homes needing
repairs, whose residents are
willing to provide the necessary
funds for supplies, but annot af-
ford the labor. SCA provides
this labor by giving individual
students and student organiza-
tions (such as Fraternities and
Clubs), the opportunity to work.

SCA had its first volunteers
last weekend. Saturday morn-
ing nine members of Chi Psi
Fraternity rebuilt two stair
cases in a_ lower-income
neighborhood of Glasgow. One
resident, Mrs. Mamie Dunne,
was “tickled to death’’ over her
new steps.

SCA, recently formed on cam-
pus, hopes to both improve the

News Briefs ——

Outer Space Arms Race

Remember the space shuttle?
It looked something like a stub-
by airplane and it was supposed
to shuttle us earthlings to a
space station floating around
the globe, just like the science
fiction movies. ;

Well, the shuttle craft’s first
purpose will be as a military
weapon for outer space war-
fare, not manufacturing or
medical research. In the now
escalating spy war between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, the
space shuttle will play a very
important part.

Defense Secretary Harold
Brown told the Senate Commit-
tee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation last month that
the shuttle will be used to build
military installations in space
Either military spy stations or
bases with large lasers to blow
away hostile missiles or enemy
spacecraft.

President Carter made an in-
teresting reversal on the shut-
tle, ignoring it until Pentagon

officials told him about the shut- -

tle’s potential as a weapon —
and increased the budget for the
shuttle’s development.

One of our spy satellites got
some pictures of a Soviet shut-
tle craft, which has a striking
similarity to ours. But the Rus-
sians are still supposed to be

behind us in development of a
shuttle ship.

“One thing seems sure,” the
Baltimore Sun lamented. ‘‘The
U.S. and the Soviet Union are
engaged once again in an arms
race, this time in outer space,
with manned military
spaceships that might be armed
with weapons straight out of a
George Lucas movie.

Tuition Increases

W&L has fared pretty well in
the battle of the tuition in-
crease. Our tuition increase of
$350 or 9.5 percent isn’t bad
when compared with: YALE -
11.9 percent; DARTMOUTH -
13.1 percent; UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO - 13.3 percent; and
MIT - 17 percent.

What Price Art?

Who can appraise the price of
art? The General Services Ad-
ministration thinks it can and
has decided to purchase totem
poles for the fronts of 10 federal
office buildings throughout the

country.
At $10,000 a shot it’s a $100,000
decoration package.

‘““Microscopic,’”’ one GSA _ of-
ficial scoffed to a reporter for
Jack Anderson. A real bargain
for the taxpayers who foot the
bill.

McCormick Renovation Nears Completion

By Will Jackson

Despite the rain, sleet, snow
and the necessity of arriving at
work during winter’s dark of
night, the construction crews
renovating McCormick Hall are
nearing completion of their
work, well within contract
schedules for both time and
price.

The $3.5 million project to
convert the former Cyrus Hall
McCormick Library into the
new home of the School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics
began last February. The job,
except for installation of fur-
nishings and educational equip-
ment, should be completed by
summer, with the actual move
to be finished in time for the
start of the next year’s term.

According to Frank Parsons,
assistant to the President of the
University, ‘‘one consideration
of the job was the preservation
of the character of the rooms.”’
This was accomplished by the
architectural firm of Marcellus,
Wright, Cox & Ladd primarily
through the use of dropped ceil-
ings.

All mechanical and electrical
systems are concealed within
the accoustical time-covered
ceilings, which curve up at the
sides to accommodate the
elaborate woodwork and tall
windows which are features of
the original building.

Maximum use of natural light
has been made throughout the
building. In some cases, walls

       

are angled to include more win-
dows in the rooms. Shadow-free
fluorescent grids, recessed in
the dropped ceilings, provide
ample artificial lighting.

The building is being com-
pleted from the top floor down,
which W&L’s Plant Projects
head, Pat Brady, says is the
sensible procedure for a
building of this size. Thus, while
all that remains to be done on
the third floor is painting, and
the second, or main, level is
mostly finished as well, the
basement still needs ceiling and
trim work and some further
wiring.

Brady noted that since the
project primarily involves in-
terior renovation, the persistent
bad weather has not caused
many delays. Intermittent dry
spells have allowed completion
of much of the masonry work
around the ODK circle, and of
the brick wheelchair access
ramp on the back of the
building.

The remodeled McCormick
building offers three times as
much space as Newcomb Hall.
Among its amenities are five
large classrooms, two semi-
circular, tiered ‘‘conference
classrooms” with projection
facilities, and several study and
seminar rooms.

Basement lounges are provid-
ed for both faculty and students.
(Though it lacks a_ private
bathroom, the student lounge
has more windows. )

Workman applies finishing touches to a ceiling.

     

   
      
   

The columned. reading room
of the former library has been
preserved for the same purpose
in the commerce school, and the
room immediately above it will
become the data center, to
which Tucker Hall’s computer
facilities will be moved.

Offices for 23 faculty
members are also included in
the renovation. Among these,
the most impressive is Dean
Edward C. ‘Atwood’s suite,
which includes a secretarial of-
fice and his large personal of-
fice, featuring three windows
and a private bathroom with
shower.

A major reason for the suc-
cess of the conversion project to
date, according to Brady, is
that ‘‘we have very good con-
tractors — they’re doing good
work.’’ The companies involved
are Bass Construction Co.,
general contractors, Howard P.
Foley, Co., electrical contrac-
tors, and Harris Heating and
Plumbing, Inc., mechanical
contractors, all Richmond-
based firms. In addition,
Charles W. Barger and Son of
Lexington are serving as sub-
contractors.

Tucker Hall is the next W&L
building slated for renovation.
Although contracts have not yet
been signed, work on the
building is expected to start in
April or May, with completion
in about 18 months. By necessi-
ty, said Parsons, that job will be
completed in phases, again pro-

“Once the computer center has
been moved,” Parsons said,
“they can complete the renova-
tion of that space.”’

Professional Directs ‘Pippin’

score consists of songs which
have since become pop stan-

By John Wells

The Washington and Lee
Drama Department is prepar-
ing for a March 24th opening of
the Tony award-winning
musical Pippin. Rehearsals
have been under way since
February for the production,
which will be presented at the
Troubadour Theatre.

Pippin was a major success
on Broadway when it opened in
the early 1970’s. Written and
composed by Stephen Schwartz
and Roger Hirson, (Godspell,
The Magic Show ), the original
production was directed and
choreographed by Bob Fosse,
who has been behind some of
the finest musical entertain-
ment to emerge on the stage in
the past two decades. Pippin
was a smash hit, winning im-
mense critical acclaim and
launching the careers of cur-
rent stars like Ben Vereen and
Oscar-nominee Jill Clayburgh.
The plot of the musical is based
on actual historical characters.
Pippin was the son of the
medieval e orer Charlemagne,
and the story deals with his at-
tempts to find a place for

dards; “Magic To Do” and
“‘Corner of the Sky.”’

The W&L case of Pippin in-
cludes sixteen players, among
them: Davis Sorrells, a senior
and a drama major whose
previous appearances include A
Doll’s Bouse, will portray the
“Teading Player’; Art Dun-
nam, also a senior recently seen
in Hamlet will perform the title
role; Pippin’s stepmother,
Fastrade, will be played by
Ginger McNeese; Charlemagne
will be played by Richard Boaz.
Other players include Robert
Schuman as Louis, Rose Gor-
don as Bertha, and law wife
Penny Westbrook as Kathy. The
musical director and producer
is W&L’s fine arts chairman .
Albert C. Gordon.

The cast and, undoubtedly,
the production has received the
benefit of work and assistance
from a professional director
and choreographer, Steve
Wiliford. Wiliford, a North
Caroline native, has himself
twice played the role of the

‘Leading Player’’ in Pippin
(most recently this summer at
the Haymarket Theater in Rich-
mond) and has been supervis-
ing rehearsals for several
weeks. Last week he was quoted
as saying ‘‘Without a doubt, this

- is one of the best rehearsed col-

lege shows I’ve ever seen.’’ The
director has had a wide and
varied career in the theater,
from Busch Garden enter-
tainments to Shakespeare com-
edies and recent fare such as
The Owl and the Pussycat.
Wiliford will return to New
York on closing night.

Drama professor Thomas
Ziegler has designed the set-
tings which take advantage of
the carnival-like atmosphere
and Charles Markley will con-
duct a five-piece orchestra,
located in a specially con-
structed off-stage pit.

Pippin will be performed at
the Troubadour Theatre from
Monday March 24th until Satur-
day the 29th. The box-office is
open, and required reservations
may be obtained by calling
463-9111, ext. 371.

African Jazz Group To Appear

”

“The Oneness of JuJu,’’ an
African jazz group from Rich-
mond currently touring
Virginia under the sponsorship
of the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts, will perform at
Washington and Lee University
tomorrow evening at 8 p.m. in
Evans Hall. The program is
sponsored by W&L’s Student
Association for Black Unity in
cooperation with’ the
Rockbridge Chapter of the
Virginia Museum.

‘Afro jazz by the Oneness of
JuJu penetrates your mind,
body and soul,” one music critic
wrote recently of the group. In
their hour-long performance

and seminar, the members at-
tempt to trace the development
of Afro-American music from
its primitive origins to contem-
porary avant-garde jazz and
even disco music. Included are
explorations of the relationship
between jazz and more modern
rock rhythms and melodies, the
fusion music of the 1960s, and
the essential color of traditional
African music. Innovators and
major personalities in the
development of this important
branch of Western music will
also be discussed.

The group has recorded on a
number of commercial record-
ing labels and has been featured

at the Newport Jazz Festival,
the New York Musicians’ Jazz
Festival, the Berkeley Jazz
Festival and San Francisco’s
Black Expo.

On the morning of March 21,
the group will conduct a
workshop for interested musi-
cians. Reservations for the
workshop may be made through
Barbara Crawford, president of
the Rockbridge museum
chapter, at 463-7395, or W&L
assistant dean of students John
White at 463 463-9111, ext. 240.

No admission will be charged
for the concert, which is open to
the public. Beverages will be on
sale in Evans Hall.

A Clockwork Orange (1972) Stanley Kubrick’s adaption of the
William 8urgess novel. The film is dominated by those concerns so
dear to the director’s heart: social satire, social sterility, and social
violence. These elements are developed in a wickedly entertaining
fashion in earlier Kubrick pictures, notable Lolita and Dr.
Strangelove; here, however, while there are scenes of satirical
humor, the overriding theme is senseless, orgiastic violence. With
Malcolm McDowell. Presented by the SAB, March 2ist — 23rd, in
Dupont Auditorium at 7 arid 9 p.m. Admission is $1.

‘Daddy’s Money Band’ Tonight

By Mark Beamer

Thursday night, March 20, the
foundations of the Cockpit will
be shaken by the forceful, hard-
driving vibrations of Daddy’s
Money Band, an unforgettable,
highly acclaimed five-man
blues band, who pound out rock
‘n roll, rhythm and blues, and
blues toa different beat.

Daddy’s Money appeal lies
in its retrieval of earlier rock
and blues tunes, which usually
tends to be disrégarded. The
members of the band interject
their own interpretation and in-
strumental skill into the 50s and
60s rock ‘n roll, giving it a new
dimension and allowing a
change from the tiresome, con-

If W&L students want to catch
a glimpse of a most unique ris-
ing talent, they should be sure
to see Willie Nininger in the
Cockpit on Wednesday, March

26 from 8-1 p.m.

Willie Nininger is a gifted
songwriter—folksinger, who
combines his wit, satire, in-
strumental skill, and glittering
personality to captivate his au-
dience, and to encourage them
to participate in the show that
he thoroughly enjoys perform-
ing. \

It is Nininger’s rare ability to
make his audiences feel at
home, as if he is playing for
them in their own family rooms,
that makes the artist so popular
in the New York area, where he
makes his home.

During the past few months,
Nininger has been visiting col-
lege campuses and small con-
cert halls along the East Coast.
He has made stops at William

and Mary, Virginia Tech,
University of Virginia, and
North Carolina State.

Although the talented folks-
inger performs songs from Bob
Dylan, Arlo Guthrie, Paul
Simon, Jackson Brown, Bruce
Springsteen, John Prine, and
the Beatles, his most popular
tunes are his own original songs
that include ‘‘Country Dough’’,
“Freshmen,” and ‘‘Proud to be
a Moose,” He also plays other
traditional tunes like his rock-
ing version of ‘“The William Tell
Overture,’’ which is the “Lone
Ranger Theme.’

There will be no cover charge

Falling,” and Jimmy Reed’s ’’]
Ain’t Got You.”

Whatever the band plays,
they don’t expect their au-
diences to sit still. In fact, Dad-
dy’s Money will be disappointed
if the entire Pit isn’t dancing in
the aisles when they kick off
their energized, rocking sets.

Although the group has only
been together as Daddy’s
Money for four months, they
have made such ‘an impact on
the musical scene that talk of a
recording contract in the near
future has been overheard.

Praised by radio stations
along the East Coast as one of,
if not the best, ‘‘professional’’
blues bands to play the concert
circuit, Daddy’s Money pro-
mises to rock the Pit without
pause from 8-11 p.m., this
Thursday night.

With no cover charge for the

‘show, don’t miss your chance to

see Daddy’s Money when they
perform live, in the Cockpit.

Movie Review

Empty ‘Gigolo’

By Frank Billingsley

Paul Schrader’s American
Gigolo seemingly attempts to
do for male prostitution what
Robin Hood did for robbery —
heroize it. Indeed, between his
black Mercedes convertible,
Georgia Armani attire, dinners
in chic restaurants, and good
looks; Julian Kay (Richard
Gere) certainly makes his oc-
cupation appear quite
fashionable — if not downright
enviable. Granted the costum-
ing is tasteful and elegant, the
scenery excellent, and the peo-
ple lead enchanting lifestyles;
but, unfortunately, this picture
remains strictly on the surface.

Julian Kay, the American
Gigolo, has risen quickly to a
world of profitable escorting
through a clientele of rich
Beverly Hills-Palm Springs
women. He is a slick harlot who
knows all the right things to do
and say, making his position
clear from the beginning, ‘‘I
don’t do fags or kink... I give
pleasure to women.”’

Yet Kay cannot receive
pleasure himself — apparently
not even from Lauren Hutton,
the beautiful wife of a powerful
Senator, who is destined to fall
in love with Kay and eventually
save his life. The screenplay,
also written by Schrader,
begins powerfully enough but
plummets weakly as_ the
minutes tick. As the story un-
folds, a previous client of Kay’s
is found dead — and Kay is left
holding the blame. No one will
accept his alibi. He has gotten
where he is in this world by
stepping on too many toes, slap-
ping too many faces, insulting
too many peopie, and now with
a charge of murder on his head
Kay has become persona non

grata in all circles, left only to
the mercy of those framing
him. But, alas, Lauren Hutton,
staking her marriage and hus-
band’s career, appears on the
scene to lie for Kay and spring
him from jail.

This is where the major flaw
in Gigolo arises. The ending
parallels too much the Greek
method of deux ex machina —a
device used in days of old when
a Greek god literally came
down from the clouds at the last
minute to rescue the drama’s,
hereo from’ inescapable
tragedy. It is a cheap way out.
And so with Gigolo — yes, the
ending is happy and typically
fairy-tale, but Kay is up a creek
and Hutton provides the
paddle much, much too easily:
It reminds me of the way Bat-
man and his pal used to escape
from their hopeless perils.

That’s the problem with the
plot.

Richard Gere’s_ problems,
which are not many, can be
blamed on the script which is
too confining to give Kay much
depth or produce a_ totally
steady character. When Gere is
called on for any kind of emo-
tion he fills the bill credulously
enough, and although his per-
formance is hardly Oscar
material he far surpasses
anything John Travolta could
ever hope to pull off: (Travolta
was originally cast in the film
but bagged it for who-knows-
why? — or cares?)

Lauren Hutton makes a par-
ticularly good showing
physically, lighting up the
screen, and as an actress. She
carries her role sincerely and
with a flair that makes her com-
fortable with the audience.

A Different
Look In ‘80

By Bill Whalen

Jack Emmer sat in the lacrosse lockerroom
after his team’s easy defeat of Syracuse and tried
to describe what happened.

You almost had to feel sorry for him.

You see, Jack Ammer’s lacrosse squad was low-
ly ranked in the pre-season polls and was not given
much of a chance to defeat the Orangemen, who
had been ranked sixth in one pre-season poll. And
there he was, almost an hour after the game, try-
ing to play down the win and his team’s per-
formance.

Sorry, Jack, but you had a right to be bragging
about your team after the way it performed on
Saturday.

Here were the Generals, a team which in 1979
could only depend on roughly four players to
score, getting goals out of eight different players.
Here was a team that was playing without one of
its better midfielders. Here was a team that had to
play in the muddy type of turf which normally
restricts its swing-style and cutting offense. And
all the Generals did was roll up their highest point
total since the Hofstra game of last year, the
lowest goals-allowed total since the Salisbury
State game of 1978 and the widest victory margin
since the Towson State game of last year.

No wonder Emmer was having such a hard time
trying to find flaws in his team.

Instead, the Generals seemed to have answered | n

any questions as to their strength and filled any
holes that may have existed before the season
started.

For example, W&L’s defense, which had dif-
ficulty clearing from its zone and picking up
ground balls, easily controlled the Orangemen’s

attack, which had rolled up 13 goals against a good
N.C. State team. Jim Herbert, playing man-to-
man defense against Brad Short, the All-
American attackman, held his man to only one
goal.

The middies corps, which was without the ser-
vices of George Santos, one of W&L’s better
players at that position, showed unexpected depth
as four different middies scored goals. Right now,
the middies would be the best asset of the
Generals, except for one fact.

Kearney Scores
Three In Romp

Chris Kearney, making his first appearance ina
W&L uniform in two years, scored three goals and
Rob Staugaitis added two goals and five assists as
the Washington and Lee lacrosse team upset
Syracuse, 12-5.

The win, the Generals’ first in the 1980 regular
season, moved W&L up to sixth place in the first
lacrosse poll of the regular season. The Generals
had been rated No. 12in pre-season polls.

“We needed this win to get our momentum
Started,” said winning Coach Jack Emmer. “It
also re-established us as a national contender.”’

Syracuse started the scoring, as Ralph Spinola
scored with the game only three minutes old. After
this score, all of the momentum went the
Generals’ way, as W&L cleared the ball effective-
ly and put pressure on the Syracuse goalie.

Kearney entered the game at approximately the
five-minute mark and immediately made his
presence known. Kearney scored the Generals’
first goal on a man-up situation at the seven-
minute mark of the first quarter.

Freshman John Doub scored two minutes later
to give the Generals a 2-1 lead. A man-up goal by
John Kemp at the ten-minute mark gave W&L a
3-1 lead.

For W&L in the second quarter, it was all
.Kearney. The 6’8” attackman scored twice in
seven minutes to give the Generals a 5-1 lead. A
Syracuse goal left the halftime score at 5-2.

If there was any doubt as to the outcome of the
game, it was answered by the midway mark of the
third quarter. After the Ordngemen scored to cut
the lead to 5-3, the Generals ripped off four
straight goals to take an imposing 9-3 advantage.

Freshman Geoff Wood made the score 6-3 and
John Hooper pumped in two goals to make it 8-3.
Staugaitis scored his first goal to put the score at
9-3.

One reason the W&L offense was performing so
well was the strong execution of the W&L defense.
All-American goalie Bob Clements was tough all
afternoon, stopping 18 of 23 shots. Jim Herbert
also played well, holding All-American attackman
Brad Short to one goal.

Netmen Lose To Strong ODU Squad, 8-1

By Dale Park

With the weather finally per-
mitting, the W&L netmen were
able to compete in at least one
of their last four scheduled mat-
ches.

Although last Friday’s and
Saturday’s matches against
West Chester State and George
Mason University, respective-
ly, were showed out, the
Generals did manage to play
Old Dominion University at
home on Sunday.

Old Dominion is one of the top
Division I tennis teams in
Virginia. Despite some good
first-set performances by some
of the Division III Generals, Old
Dominion won easily, 8-1.

The only bright spot for W&L

was freshman Steve Denny’s
6-1, 6-2 win over ODU’s John
Harrison at sixth singles.

The rest of the afternoon
belonged to Old Dominion.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson, playing Bill Clark at
first singles, barely lost the first
set, 7-46. Despite some tough
passin9 shots from Jackson,
Clark was able to take control of
the net late in the match and
Dominion’s flight-one singles
man took the second set, 6-3.

W&L freshman Jack Shar-
man had a rough time at second
singles as he was easily downed
by Robert Hale, 6-2, 6-0. Junior
Peter Lovell, like Jackson, lost
a close 7-6 first set decision
against Colin Davis at third

singles. Yet again, it was the
ODU player who took charge in
the second set and Lovell suc-
cumbed, 6-1.

Both senior co-captain David
Constine and junior Doug Gaker
went quietly against tough op-
ponents. Constine, the defen-
ding 0.D.A.C. champ at fourth
singles, fell to Todd Furniss,
6-1, 6-1, while Gaker bowed to
Ken Phelan, 6-3, 6-2.

The doubles were swept by
0.D.U.

Jackson and fellow senior Pat
Norris teamed at first doubles
for W&L, but were dropped, 6-1,
6-3, by Clark and Furniss of Old
Dominion despite some good
net play by iNorris.

At second doubles, Lovell and
Gaker of the Generals gave
Hale and Phelan a fight in the
first set, falling 7-5, while drop-
ping the second set 6-2. In the

meantime, W&L’s Constine and
Sharman of W&L, who teamed
at third doubles, failed to get on
track against Davis and Har-
rison, losing a 6-0, 6-2 decision.

By Chris Sisto

The Generals’ baseball team
opened its season on a negative
note as by dropping a 10-3 con-
test to Longwood Coilege last
week.

The game was much closer
than the score indicates as the
Generals had chances fo get
some runs but left the bases
loaded in both the eighth and
ninth innings, leaving a total of
six men on base.

Joel Weston went the full nine
innings on the mound for
Washington and Lee. Weston
pitched fairly well for his first

commenting on

outing as a college pitcher,
walking only three and giving
up four earned runs.

Weston’s undoing came in the
seventh inning when W&L’s
defense fell apart. The team co-
mitted five errors in_ that
stretch and gave up six unearn-
edruns.

Despite the loss, Head Coach
Chuck Kroll was pleased with
his team’s play and is sure they
will be winners in the future.
“This was the best we have
looked in the two years I have
been with the team,”’ said Kroll,
the game.

“Longwood didn’t beat us, we
beat ourselves.”’

“I’m confident we will do bet-
ter,’’ continued the coach.

Kroll praised the offensive
power of Chris Cavalline, who
had three hits, and the defen-
sive work of John Stagmaier,
who made some fine plays in
the field.

The Generals’ home opener
scheduled for last Saturday was
postponed due to poor playing
conditions. The team’s next
game is Thursday night against
ODAC opponant Bridgewater
College in an away game.

And that factor is the attack.
Rob Staugaitis had five assists
for the second straight game,
Mike Pressler scored a goal and
dealt out several checks to
Syracuse defensemen and
freshmen Geoff Wood saw lots
of playing time and scored
once.

But the biggest factor of all
had to be Chris Kearney. He
entered the game with W&L
behind 1-0 and; when he left,
had scored three times to give
his team a 5-2 advantage.

On a team which appears to
be strong all over, Kearney
may be the most visible
strength of all. His mere size
dictates fear from opposing
defensemen and his movement
draws enough attention to allow
his teammates to get open for
easy shots. In a game with his
team down by a goal, Kearney
can easily be called on for ins-
tant offense.

Which is what he did against
Syracuse.

But how should we evaluate
Saturday’s win? Actually, it
was the first in a series of
necessary wins to gain the
playoffs. The seven-goal win
vaulted the Generals six places
and dropped five

Still, it should’ be
remembered that the polls do
not determine who does or does
not go into the playoffs. Last
year, for example,
Massachusetts was not among
the top eight rated teams but
still was selected by virtue of
some impressive late- season
wins. So don’t pay too much at-
tention to the polls until the end
of the season.

Saturday’s game against N.C.
State will be another of those
contests that the selecting com-
mittee will look at when
deciding playoff berths. Con-
sidering the explosiveness of
the Wolfpack’s offense, it
should be another good test for
the Generals.

Golf Team To Start
With Youthful Squad

by Kip Gordon

Poor weather has plagued the
golf Generals so far this season,
forcing their first two matches
to be postponed and imposing
uncomfortable practice condi-
tions. But with any luck, the
Generals will open their 1980
season today against
Longwood.

This year’s team is a young
one with only two seniors and
two sophomores returning from
last year’s starting six.

Senior Gerry Barousse will
captain the Generals this
season and figures to be the

mainstay of the squad. A two-
year letterman, Barousse is the
defending ODAC titlist, and
finished 11th in a 120 player
field in. last year’s NCAA Divi-

.sion III Championships.

Other returning lettermen in-
clude Senior Tom Wall and
sophomores Jim Kaplin and Bill
Alfano.

Again, due to the weather,
practice time has been limited
and for this reason the team
roster is still not complete at
this writing. A junior, two
sophomores, and 10 freshmen

are new faces to golf tryouts
this year, bringing the total
number of candidates to 20 for
the 12 positions on the team.

The team this year will be

‘looking for its third ODAC title,

and a fourth-straight trip to the
NCAA tournament.

These goals may be a bit
overambitious for the golf
Generals considering their
youth, but Coach Buck Leslie is
still confident. “Although we’re |
a bit short on experience, we do
have some talent to work with,”’
he said.

Lax Team Hosts Wolf Pack

Syracuse cut the lead to 9-4,
but John Sancilio put the
Generals ahead, 10-4. After
another Syracuse score, at-
tackman Mike Pressler and
Staugaitis each scored to end
the game at 12-5, W&L.

After the game, Emmer had
nothing but praise for his team.
‘“‘We had a good balanced at-
tack,’’ said the coach, “‘and our
defense did a good job geeting
ground balls and making
stops.”’

undefeated record on the line
this Saturday at home against
the N.C. State Wolfpack. Last
week, the Wolfpack lost a 13-12
decision to Syracuse.

According to Emmer, N.C.
State has an “‘explosive offense,
which will give our defense a
good test.’’ To beat the
Wolfpack, Emmer says _ his
team will “have to control the
ball and keep the pressure in
their (N.C. State’s) zone.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Elections And The SCC

The president and vice-president of each academic
class do much more than organize the annual class
grain party—they sit on the Student Control Commit-
tee. Serving as members of Student Control is, simply
put, the most important funtion the class president
and vice-president perform. When you are caught for
‘“‘ungentlemanly behavior’? down the road or for
trashing bushes on campus, you will appear before
Student Control. Your future actions will be judged by
the peers you elect Monday.

Unlike last week’s election, there will be plenty of
choice on Monday’s ballot (see page 2). Three can-
didates are running for senior class president, five for
junior class president, and four for sophomore class
president. There is even more competition for the ex-
ecutive committee and vice-presidential positions.

With so many in the flock, there’s sure to be a lot of
hand-shaking and other politicking. There will pro-
bably be ample opportunity to query the candidates
about marijuana-smoking-in-the-dorm-penalties,
drunken-escapade-punishments, and other pertinent
questions about Student Control’s procedures. After
all, if they’re running for the position, surely they
know what the job entails, right?

Fraternities And Honor Pledges

Monday’s Executive Commit- —_ scious sidestepping of them.
tee vote ‘‘recommending”’ that
fraternity presidents not sign a
pledge concerning the uphold-
ing of their house’s social pro-
bation raises two important
questions.

It just goes to show, everyone
loves a party, and not even the
EC would want the honor

system to stand in the way of
having fun.

First, is the EC admitting
that fraternities often break the
rules of their probation? And
second, is the EC attempting to
grant fraternities permission
for future violations by
disallowing the pledge?

EC President Steve

member, summed it up clearly
when he said, ‘‘the pledge puts
fraternity presidents in a bind—
they have a duty to the house

Thoughts On
The $1,000 Shower

What happens when a big-league executive goes
down south to teach at a small, all-male semi-prep
college? It’s really quite obvious: he begins to miss
the hustle and bustle of the real world; the competi-
tion, the stress, the intense high-level meetings with
other execs; and most of all, the former big-leaguer
misses his shower. How badly does he miss his
shower? Well, if given the chance, he will have one in-
Stalled next to his office.

And that is exactly what Edward Charles Atwood
Jr., Dean of the School of Commerce, has done—
installed a shower next to his office. The tiled shower
only cost about $1,000; a real bargain.

Dean Atwood’s shower deal is such a bargain that
we are beginning to wonder if all professors shouldn’t
have their own showers adjoining their offices.
Maybe the younger professors could get hot tubs,
even suanas. The possibilities are limitless.

Of course, equal shower privileges could get a little
expensive—perhaps only the department heads
should be allowed the luxury. But other department
heads still do not have the advantage Dean Atwood,
not so affectionately known by his students as ‘‘Eddie
the Ax,’’ enjoys: he works a mere 40 yards from his
home. It is an old house, but we bet it has plumbing,
toilets, probably a bath tub, and maybe even a
shower.

God forbid Dean Atwood take a shower in the gym.
How demeaning! The mere thought is simply in-
tolerable. Besides, how else can a small-college pro-
fessor play big-league executive without his own
private shower facility?

proposed path

 

Is Abraham implying that ;
there is a breakdown between 1 Merwe. 3 evening
fraternity presidents and the 2 Fer att pefore during:
honor system or perhaps be- od afler classes,
tween the president and his
fraternity? In any case, there
should be no conflict in signing
a pledge if a house has adhered
to the probation. !

The EC believes that such a
pledge is ‘‘trivial,”’ and perhaps
many fraternities consider it
so—particularly ones which
break their probation.

W&L Should Become Co-ed

An interesting commentary
in last week’s edition. I’m glad
we can hear the arguments
against coeducation. Mr.
Willhite has presented his sen-

but I think we should examine
those arguments before we ac-
cept them as fact.

I stumbled first when I read
that ‘five (women’s schools)

about Mr. Willhite’s hometown,
but in my hometown, if my date
lives 35, 40, or 50 miles from me,

Commentary.

‘What’s This Tradition?’

“Hey dad, I’ve been looking at some of your old Washington and
Lee catalogs, but I’m having trouble understanding some of the
concepts they describe.’’

‘Bring them here son and let’s have a look at what’s troubling
you.”’

“Dad, I’ve been reading about single-sex colleges in my ab-
normal psychology text and I was wondering what you think to be
the advantages of all-male schools.”’

“It may seem funny to you son, but college life was great back
then. You see classes were very small and the students all had a
great time learning and socializing with the faculty. Most of our
time was spent studying, but there were times for parties, too and
boy were they ever good ones. In fact, the school was like one big
college class; everyone knew everyone else and we all enjoyed the
friendship and supurb education the small size and single-sex at-
mosphere W&L provided.”

“You say that a single-sex atmosphere contributed to the superb
education?”’

“That’s right son, you see we studied more often because girls
were not around to distract us. We could get them and make use of
them when we needed them, but we didn’t have to, Lee forbid, live
with them.”

“Oh, I see. Dad, can you define atequaee and sexism for me?’”’

‘‘Huh, what’s that son?”

‘‘Nothing dad.”’

“You see it’s not that we were afraid of them son, it’s just single-
sex schools gave people the freedom to choose the type of at-
mosphere they wanted. Co-ed schools did exist for those that
wanted both boys and girls on the same campus together, but for
the most part, it was tradition for boys and girls to go to separate
schools in my day.”

‘What was this tradition dad? Was it useful? Isn’t it what let peo-
ple choose a husband for their daughters, and keep slaves and deny
the vote to women, and establish literacy tests, and unify church
and state, and...”’

*“‘What?”’

“Don’t you see dad that a single-sex education denied you the
right to a logical education? Don’t you agree that the ability not to
be distracted from work by ‘objects’, like women, is a sign of
maturity and that a false maturity was thrust upon you? And how
can you justify the denial of admission to people whose only crime
was being female? Can’t you perceive the incredible amount of ar-
rogance needed to uphold such a moral and social anachronis?”’

“Tradition! Tradition!”’

‘‘But how is tradition useful? What is it?”’

“Tradition is where over the course of time a set way of doing
things is recognized as being the best and most enjoyable way anda
change would only be for the worst.”

“So, tradition is based on the past. Wasn’t it a rather rigid
system? Didn’t it lead to stagnation? You still haven’t told me how
it is useful. If it was so good, why did W&L stop this tradition?”

“Because the people didn’t appreciate a good thing when they
had it. They thought it would be fun having girls around all the
time; on the athletic teams, in ths classes, in the dorms, in their
showers, etc. They thought it would be great not having to fool with
road trips anymore.’

‘Road trip, what’s that?”’

“That means that we had to drive to a girls school to see them. It
was nice because putting on clean clothes and seeing the girls
became special occasion and we looked forward to seeing them.
Just like we look forward to seeing your mother on weekends when
we drive to see her on a road trip. We saw the girls, like we see your
mother, when we wanted to, not because we had to.”’

“But Dad, doesn’t that attitude imply the superiority of the male
who can pick and choose? Didn’t it debase the role of women as

‘human beings?’’

“Uh...yes...I can kind of see your point, but it must be wrong,
because it is not consistent with tradition which is always right.
Well, I hope I’ve cleared that up son.”’

“You sure have dad, but I did have one more thing to ask you.”

“‘What’s that son?”’

“Dad, are you for real?”

Richmond.

It also interests me that Mr.
Willhite believes the single-sex
atmosphere provides the friend-
ships and superb education we
enjoy at W&L, It may sound in-
credible, but I think there are
some small co-ed colleges that
also offer friendships and
superb education.

I didn’t realize those two ad-
vantages were inextricably
linked to. single-sex  at-
mosphere. Mr. Willhite might
even find that he would have
some friends who were girls at
those co-ed schools. Though
perhaps not, if he let them read
his commentaries.

I certainly agree with Mr.
Willhite that single-sex schools
allow freedom to choose bet-
ween co-ed and all-male
schools. But there are two pro-
blems here.

First, I don’t believe there is
much demand for single-sex
schooling these days. There are
obviously 1400 undergraduates
here, but the vast majority of
tnose students came here for
reasons other than the single-
sex atmosphere, I have, admit-
tedly, met two people who have
told me they came here because
the school was single-sex, and
there are undoubtedly others
who came here for that reason.
But those students are in a tiny
minority. Should we feel con-
strained to remain single-sex
for a-very few people out of our
population?

I think we should interest
ourselves, instead, in trying to
join (or remain in) the ranks of
the nation’s finest colleges. We
would be a better school if we
admitted a broader sampling of
the population?

The other problem is that I
don’t believe high school
students who have spent most of
their years in co-ed schools can
understand what it means to at-

Law School ee
To Burnham Letter

To the Editor:

At the risk of reviving an
issue that hopefully is dead, I
feel compelled to respond to Mr.
Burnham’s letter to the Phi of
March 13, 1980.

Mr. Burnham either did not
know or instead chose to ignore
the facts that led to the article
in the Law News and to the ac-
tions of Kevin Ross.

Neither of these things was in-
tended nor should have been
considered a personal attack on
Mr. Burnham. I, therefore, find
it difficult to understand or ex-
cuse the type of response that
Mr. Burnham chose to make to
the Phi.

Since the beginning of the
school year, the Phi has failed
to deliver nearly one-half of its
total number of issues to Lewis
Hall.

Part of each law student’s Ac-
tivities Fee is retained by the
EC each year to fund a portion
of the university-wide ac-
tivities, such as the Phi.

Repeated attempts through
various channels by several law
students to prompt regular
delivery of the Phi met with
repeated assurances that the
problem had been recognzied
and corrected.

When Mr. Burnham took over

. the job of delivering the paper,

it was hoped that everything
had indeed been straightened
out. Kevin Ross’s actions were
therefore justified when on
February 28, the Phi, once
again, failed to appear at Lewis
Hall.

Mr. Burnham told me that
this “‘oversight’’ was a result of
personal pre-Fancy Dress
preparations. Mr. Burnham
should remember that he is be-
ing paid each week from the
pocket of every student at
Washington and Lee. If his per-
sonal schedule is too crowded to
tully perform his duties,
perhaps other arrangements
should be made.

I have received personal
assurances from Mr. Burnham
that the delivery problems will
not be repeated. I take him at
his word.

Nonetheless, his supercilious
tone and derogatory references
to Kevin Ross offended many
law students and was complete-
ly inexcusable in light of the cir-
cumstances.

Kevin Ross is a valued friend
and a respected member of the
law school community. I
believe that Mr. Burnham owes .
him an apology.

Sincerely,
Bill Garrett
President, SBA

Studying And Fire Alarm Buzzers

 

 

As I sit in my carrol on the fourth floor of the
library, trying to write a term paper, my thoughts
are continually distracted by a high, shrill buzzer
which tells me that someone has either come in or
gone out of one of the fire doors.

It’s upsetting to me that the one place on cam-
pus which should allow students to study peaceful-
ly isn’t fulfilling that obligation because ‘‘someone
up there’’ hasn’t figured out that his sacred fire
doors are an inconvenience, and:no more.

The doors are not locked. So, are students com-
ing from Woods Creek Apartments or the ROTC
building expected to walk up to the main floor and
then down four flights of stairs to get to their ac-
customed study area. When an open door is right
in front of them?

Are students trying to get to one of these
buildings expected to go up four flights of stairs
and down the same amount to arrive at a place 20
feet from an open door? Sure, you say, take the
elevator. Great! They’re broken more than half

the time.

Well, if students continue to use those doors, the
buzzer will keep ringing. So are we expected to
post a guard to yell at the multitude going in and
out? Be reasonable. No one would listen and the
ones who get punished are those studying, not
those using the doors.

Furthermore, if these doors are meant to keep
down book thefts, why are they unlocked and why
doesn’t someone chase each offender to see if he or
she has carried out unchecked books? But some-
one needn’t set off an alarm to leave the library
with stolen books. Just put them with the rest of
your books and walk out the main doors. No one
will challenge you.

I hope that something will be done so that I can
Study quietly and undisturbed in an area so .
designated. I’m not fond of studying anyway and
the lack of places to do so encourages me to find
nice quiet liquor stores and drinking
establishments.

tend a single-sex school. One
reason is that they fall prey to
the claim that there are five
women’s schools ‘‘located pret-
ty close to W&L.”’

I won’t quibble with Mr.
Willhite’s definition of ‘“‘tradi-
tion,” but I will argue that
traditions are founded in a cer-
tain time period that embraces
certain ideas. When we leave
that period, we must remember
that the ideas often change.

We no longer believe, for ex-

ample, that duelling is the
honorable way to settle
arguments. Some _ traditions

last longer than others. We still
believe we can be trusted to
behave honorably on this cam-
pus, and we therefore maintain
the honor system tradition.

But surely Mr. Willhite will
agree that attitudes toward
women have changed since
1749; we should, therefore, ex-
amine our school’s attitude
women to see if we should step
into the modern era.

Apparently, the time when
men attended all-male schools
to avoid being pulled into the
quagmire of inferior female in-
tellect is over. A change in our
educational system, then,
might be wise.

Mr. Willhite contends that
many people would change our
all-male status because they
believe it would be fun to have
girls around campus. He conve-
niently overlooks the fact that
many advocates of coeducation
believe the change might im-
prove the education offered in
Lexington.

Co-ed classes would enable
students to hear opinions from
men and women and would
teach us that members of both
sexes are capable of having
good ideas. We might learn that
women can contribute to class
discussion as well as to party

A: Oh, so the IFC has complete jurisdiction over the fraternities?
B: Well, no. The SAC has the right to review any IFC decisions.

A: Oh. But I guess most of the time the SAC respects the decisions
of the IFC. After all, the fraternities represent a major segment of
the student body and the W&L viewpoint has always recognized
that students should be responsible for their own affairs.

B: Well, it doesn’t really work out that way. You see, the SAC
believes that the IFC sometimes acts irresponsibly. Therefore,
they feel that they must monitor the IFC to correct any difficien-

I must admit Mr. Willhite’s
commentary was the first men-
tion I’ve heard of people think-
ing it would be fun to include on

together.

Perhaps the most interesting
part of Mr. Willhite’s commen-
tary, however, included this ex-

seeing (women) when we
wanted to, not because we had
to, as in the case of a co-ed
school.”

It’s apparently going to be
quite a shock to Mr. ; Willhite
when he graduates in a couple
of months and has to see women
nearly every day. Of course, he
can try to look for a church job.

The ’79 Graduates

How Are They Doing Now?

by Mike Perry

A survey conducted by the
University Office of Career
Development and Placement
offers encouraging news about
Washington and Lee University
1979 graduates.

A report prepared by Career
Development and Placement
Director Michael Cappetto in-
dicates that 35 percent of 1979
W&L graduates entered grad-
uate schools this past fall while
57 percent obtained jobs; only
4.8 percent remained
unemployed.

The report concluded that
business professions (including
accounting), education, jour-
nalism and the military were
the most popular careers
among members of the class of
1979. The report also added that
while approximately one-half of
last year’s working graduates
had received job offers on or
before graduation day, about 10
percent obtained their jobs in
the five months following
graduation and 50 percent con-
tinued to receive job offers
throughout the summer
months.

Summer Anthro Program

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s anthropology department
will sponsor a field school in
historical archaeology _ this
summer, giving participants an
opportunity to explore patterns
of early settlements of
Rockbridge County.

In session from mid-June
through mid-August, with the
exception of the week of July 6,
the summer program is an
outgrowth of Washington and
Lee’s series of spring and sum-
mer excavations at Liberty

IFC Weekend

60 Kegs,

Inter-fraternity Council
weekend, scheduled for this
Saturday, will feature three
bands and 60 kegs, Ab Boxley,
social chairman, told the IFC
during a meeting Monday night.

The party at Zollman’s
Pavilion is scheduled to last
from 5 p.m. until 2 a.m. and will
also feature 25-cent hot dogs
and an IFC beer chugging con-
test, Boxley said. Each fraterni-
ty can enter one chugger in the
contest and the winner’s frater-
nity will receive a keg from the
IFC,

The bands signed are Boot
Hill Express, a southern rock

Hall, the university’s 18th-
century predecessor institution.

Cabin sites and other loca-
tions of interest have already
been pinpointed, most in the
House Mountain region, ac-
cording to asociate an-
thropology professor John M.
McDaniel, who directs the field
school.

Each student will work eight
hours a day in the field, with
two evenings a week spent in
classroom or laboratory exer-
cises, McDaniel said. Transpor-

tation will be provided from the
W&L campus to the excavation
site each day.

Participation in the program
requires no previous exposure
to historic archaeology, and is
open to interested adults as well
as high school and college
students.

Registration for the program
will begin later this month. For
further information about costs,
meals and loding, call the an-
thropology department at

band; Liquid Pleasure, playing
funk and soul; and the Good
Humor Band which plays a
variety of music with a tenden-
cy toward rock. The bands are
tentatively scheduled to play in
the order they were listed.

Tickets for non-fraternity
members will cost $5 each and
$8 per couple. No tickets will be
sold at the gate.

ing nomination were made: for

The median annual salary
range for W&L graduates was
$11,000 to $11,999, an increase of
$1,000 from 1978. Business and
humanities graduates attracted
the highest median salaries
($12,000 to $12,999), followed by
the social science and jour-
nalism graduates ($11,000 to
$11,999) with the science
graduates having the lowest
median salary range ($10,000 to
$10,999).

A survey by the College
Placement Council shows
salary means for W&L grad-
uates to be similar to national
salary means for all 1979 col-
lege graduates. Mean salaries
for 1977 and 1978 graduates
were below the national
average and 1979’s figures
could be an indication that the
two year trend of low salaries
for Washington and Lee
graduates has been reversed.
The W&L report noted that this
may be especially true for
humanities graduates whose
mean salaries have lagged
significantly behind the na-
tional average in the past.

The Office of Career Develop-
ment and Placement report
also states that 23.5 percent of
W&L’s 1979 graduates consider
themselves to be ‘‘under-
employed,’ and believe that
their skills, education and
resources are being underutiliz-
ed. Another 9.7 percent of
W&L’s working graduates ‘‘saw
no future in what they are (cur-
rently) doing.’ Cappetto term-
ed this percentage ‘‘favorable”’
in light of the tough job market
situation facing virtually all col-
lege graduates and he suspects
that this is probably below the
national percentage of job
dissatisfaction among recent
college graduates.

About 35 percent of the
graduating class _ entered
graduate and_ professional
schools as full-time students.
This figure is very close to the
average number of W&L
students who traditionally opt
for graduate study.

For the fourth year in a row,
the most popular choice of
graduate study among W&L
graduates was law school; 13.9

White Front = 1° S. Main Street

Super Market

percent of the class of 1979
entered a variety of law
schools. Mercer University of
Georgia had the highest
number of W&L graduages (4)
in its first year class, while only
2 graduates are attending
Washington and Lee University
Law School.

Four percent of the
graduating class entered
business school as full-time
students. Although programs
leading to a Masters in Business
Administration (MBA) are
open to graduates from all
academic majors, most W&L
graduates who entered MBA
programs over the past three
years were business and social
science majors. Like their law
school counterparts, W&L
business students chose a wide
geographic variety of graduate
schools. Washington and Lee is
best represented at William and
Mary College where three 1979
graduates are enrolled.

Nearly seven percent of the
class of 1979 reportedly entered
medical school. Again the
schools selected by W&L grad-
uates reflected a broad
geographical range; four grad-
uates chose the University of
Virginia.

Approximately 11,1 percent of
the 1979 graduating class
entered graduate school pro-
grams other than law, medicine
or business. These graduates
elected to study at a wide varie-
ty of schools in fields ranging
from linguistics to civil
engineering, with geology being
the most popular choice among
1979 graduates.

was the only EC member to
vote against it.

Ould suggested several
changes in the original recom-
mendations, which may have
altered some EC members’
votes on the measure.

Willis and Senior
Representative Bruce Poole ap-
peared to be in opposition to the
recommendation in early
debate, but voted in favor of it
after Ould’s suggestions.

In other action Monday night,
‘the EC decided to re-submit an
amendment that would raise
the balance of the EC Reserve
Fund from $2,500 to $4,000.

The amendment did not pass
the last time it was put up, dur-
ing the Big Three Election,
because 50 percent of the stu-
dent body did not vote in the
election.

Freshman Representative
Edmund Schenecker proposed
the motion and said voting on
the amendment should span a
three-day period.

That period will fall during
Law School elections and
registration for underclassmen,
if the registrar can work out a
schedule.

Jim Vines, Chairman of the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, requested and received
$25 from the EC.

The money will be used to buy
a ledger and files for the
SELC’s records.

Vines said the SELC has kept

blem he wants to rectify.
