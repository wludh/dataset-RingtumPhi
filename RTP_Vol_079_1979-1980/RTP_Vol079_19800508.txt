Warner Leads Parade

U.S. Senator John W. Warner of Virginia will
lead the traditional Mock Convention Parade, to
be held on Friday morning, May 9. As parade mar-
shal, Warner will be the Mock Convention’s ‘‘good-
will’’ ambassador to the community and the na-
tion. In this post, he joins the list of notables that
includes William Brock in 1968, Andrew Miller in
1972, and Henry Howell in 1976.

Warner graduated from Washington and Lee in
1949 and is on the University’s Board of Trustees.
He participated in the Mock Convention in 1948
and has been active in his support of the event
since his graduation.

Born on February 18, 1927, in Washington, D.C.,
Warner received his early education in the public
schools there. After a tour of active military ser-
vice in the U.S. Navy, Warner entered Washington
and Lee in 1946. He majored in general engineer-
ing courses, physics and mathematics, and receiv-
ed his B.S. degree in June 1949. In September of
that year he entered the School of Law at the
University of Virginia. His law training was inter-
rupted for a second tour of active military service,

this time with the United States Marines in Korea.
At the end of his tour he returned to U.Va. and
graduated from the law school with an LL.B.
degree in 1953.

Warner’s political activity began with the Nixon
campaign of 1960. In 1969, he was appointed Under
Secretary of the Navy by Nixon, then in 1972, he
was nominated and approved as the Secretary of
the Navy. President Ford appointed Warner to
coordinate the nation’s bicentennial celebrations
in 1975, and following the successful completion of
this assignment, Warner returned to private life in
Virginia.

Last year, he was elected to the Senate from
Virginia over Democrat Andrew P. Miller. He has
been active in the Senate, with special efforts to
limit the role of the federal government and con-
trol federal spending.

Sen. John W. Warner’s experience and leader-
ship qualities will add to the convention's authen-
ticity and help to bring it to the notoriety it
deserves as being, in the words of Newsweek, “the
most realistic’’ event of its kind in the nation.

Since 1933, the fabled hitch
has been thundering its way
around America, appearing at
parades, festivals, rodeos and
shopping centers from coast to
coast.

Ancestor to the noble steed
which bore warriors to battle in
the Crusades, more recently of
Scottish descent, the Clydesdale
was declining in numbers when
August A. Busch, Jr. acquired a
team to celebrate the repeal of
prohibition.

In the early days of American
brewing, it was said that a
brewer’s success was determin-
ed by how far his draught
horses could pull their sudsy
load in a day’s time.
Horsepower went under the
hood after World War I; that
and packaging innovations
made two things obsolete: local
beers and the horses that pulled
them to market. The Clydesdale
breed seemed to face a bleak
future.

Today, in comparison, they
flourish. What began 43 years
ago as a ceremonial gesture has
become breeding science. At
Grant’s Farm in suburban St.
Louis County, nearly 100
champion-sired pure breds
roam in picturesque pastures

By Guy Steuart

Leading this year’s
calvalcade of floats, marching
bands, and dignitaries in the
traditional Mock Convention
parade this May 9th is one of the
co-stars of the upcoming movie
Smokey and the Bandit Part II.

No, it’s not Burt Reynolds or
Sally Fields, but rather the 10-
foot-tall African elephant and
representative mascot of the
G.O.P., Jewel. Jewel will head
the pageant which proceeds
down Main Street, turning on to
Washington Street and continu-
ing on Route 60 up to Liberty
Hall Field, where she will be on
display to the public.

Securing the services of an
elephant — not to mention a
famous one — is more frus-
trating, baffling and costly than
procuring the use of its Demo-

cratic counterpart. Every type
of establishment which had
even the slightest chance of ren-
ting an elephant had been con-
tacted since September. Mock
Convention Co-chairman Dick
Schoenfeld said ‘‘every time I
received a flat rejection from
one person, I’d ask if I could be
referred to atiyone who might
be able to helps in our search.
Finally our efforts paid off
when we discovered that Jewel
would be passing by Lexington
around the time of the Conven-
tion.”’

To help raisé the money to
pay Jewel and her trainer’s fee,
the Mock Convention initiated
an elephant fund. Contributions

adjacent to what was once the
spread of America’s 18th presi-
dent. They comprise the largest
band of Clydesdales in the na-
tion.

Between 20 and 30 Clydesdale
foals are born at Grant’s Farm
each year. Standards are
demanding. All hitch horses are
at least three years of age.
Each must stand approximate-
ly 18 hands high, be bay in color,
have four white stockings and
feet, a blaze of white on the face
plus a black mane and tail.

Two eight-horse hitch teams
— one based in St. Louis, the
other in Merrimack, New
Hampshire — travel the U.S.,
logging about 40,000 miles and
300 appearances yearly;
answering the question of how
the Clydesdales can show up in
Miami’s Orange Bowl Parade
on New Year’s Eve and appear
fresh and appropriately regal in
the next day’s Tournament of
Roses procession in Pasadena.

Transporting the Clydesdales
is itself a mammoth undertak-
ing. The horses travel in style,
befitting their designation as
“The King’s Steeds.’’ Each en-
tourage includes three 40-by-8
foot vans with air cushion

PARKING
RULES

As you know the Mock Con-
vention gets underway this Fri-
day with the parade down Main
Street. The loss of parking
along Main and Washington
Streets and the influx of over
1,000 alumni and numerous
spectators will create a severe
parking problem,

We request that the Universi-
ty community make use of
parking along Letcher Avenue
and Dupont Hall thereby leav-
ing the lots around Doremus
Gymnasium free for alumni
and press. We would also re-
quest that if possible you walk,
bike or carpool on Friday.

Thank you for your coopera-
tion in this matter and we hope
that you will join us during the
weekend at all the activities.

Senator Warner will appear in the parade.

Goldwater To Deliver Keynote Address

Barry M. Goldwater Jr., four-term Senate
verteran and patriarch of the Republican Party,
will preside at the 1980 Washington and Lee Mock
Republican Convention next May 9th and 10th.

Washington and Lee is familiar territory to the
Arizona-Senator — the connection goes back to
1964, when student delegates at the 13th Mock Con-
vention correctly predicted that Goldwater would
be selected as the Republican Party’s nominee for
the presidency.

First elected to the Senate from the Grand Ca-
nyon State in 1952, Goldwater’s first business ex-
perience was in a highly successful, family-owned
general merchandise firm. His bid for the Oval Of-
fice came at a time of great popular sympathy for
the Democratic party and its fallen hero, John
Kennedy, as well as the challenge of upsetting a
powerful incumbent in Lyndon Johnson. As a
result, he suffered what was then the worst
margin of defeat — 16 million votes — in presiden-
tial election history.

During his campaign, Goldwater advocated
basic — and extremely conservative — themes
time and again. That immorality runs rampant in
government, that the federal government is too
powerful and meddlesome in private affairs, that
the nation’s defenses are gradually decaying into
an alarming condition, that the Johnson ad-
ministration’s foreign policy followed a line of ap-
peasement and failure — all these were expanded
in the months before the election.

His continued emphasis on the preservation of
individual freedoms didn’t win him many votes —
except in the South — but his determination to
place honesty before politics and maintain an un-
popular stand for what he deemed just are still
considered major factors contributing to his
respected position today.

Columnists were quick to criticize Goldwater
after his presidential defeat, claiming he not only
lost the election but the entire conservative cause

as well. They maintained that he had splintered
the Republican party for years to come and
declared strongly that he would never be recogniz-
ed as a national party spokesman-leader again.

But time decreed otherwise — Goldwater was
welcomed back to the Senate with an enthusiastic
vote in 1968, a victory that was repeated in 1974. At
the age of 70, he is once more the dominant figure
in the Grand Old Party, though the years may
have mellowed some of those rigidly conservative
attitudes and changed his image to one of sage
reflection.

Senator Goldwater’s appearance will make this
his second visit to the W&L campus in three years.
As Mock Convention keynoter, he joins a most
distinguished list that includes Sen. Alben
Barkley, Sen. William Proxmire, then-Gov. Jim-
my Carter, and Harry S. Truman.

(Traditionally, the keynote speaker is a promi-
nent leader of the party out of executive power,
His speech is designed to spark the crowd of
delegates, press and gallery observers with a
spirig of convention exhilaration and political
pride. )

Goldwater was born in Phoenix, Arizona Ter-
ritory. He was educated in public schools of
Phoenix and Staunton Military Academy in
Virginia. He attended the University of Arizona
for one year, and served during World War II in
the China-Burma-India theatre. He is a retired
Major General in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He
began his political career in 1949 when he was
elected to the City Council of Phoenix on the
reform ticket.

He currently serves on several Senate commit-
tees, including the Armed Services Committee,
the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee
(now called the Commerce, Science and Transpor-
tation Committee) and the Select Committee on
Intelligence, on which he is now the senior
Republican member.

Regional coordinators act as
advisors to the state chairmen
and are the all-important liason
between the state officials and
the Mock Convention § co-
chairmen on the _ podium.
Responsible for monitoring the
development of _ political
research in their region
throughout the year, the coor-
dinators will meet regularly
with the officials of their
respective states.

An added duty for these
dedicated individuals is their
position on the Credentials
Committee. Here they serve
with the Mock Convention
Chairman in charge of politics,
Craig Cornett, and act as the
final authority in all matters
regarding political accuracy
and credentials policy.

Chosen last spring, these four
were selected for their acute
understanding of regional
politics; they already have a
large amount of information to
relate to the state delegations
on campaign developments. At
the convention itself, the coor-
dinators will be constantly
available to the various state
chairmen as they move to and
from sessions of the Credentials
Committee.

Platform Director Edward H.
Brown and his committee have
been selected to draft the Mock
Convention’s model platform.
This document will attempt to
reflect W&L student opinion
—the only deviation from the
standard of absolute impartiali-
ty — and will regularly survey
student opinions on current
issues. In addition, this group
plans to research various policy
alternatives, hold hearings to
gather various options, and de-
fend the final version of the
platform on the convention
floor.

Journal Editor Samuel Flax
and his committee compile the
official Convention Journal and
Record and oversee its national
distribution. The Journal is
perhaps the most lasting
memento of this three years or
more of hard work, and is
distributed to state delegates
and guests at no charge during
the Mock Convention.

Facilities Chairman Goetz
Eaton looks after all the
physical arrangements for the
affair — including design, con-
struction and decoration of the
hall in Doremus Gymnasium —
which is no small task, if one
may judge from the pictures of
previous conventions on these
pages. This committee also
works with each convention
committee in making similar
arrangements throughout the
year for related activities.

Be Discreet

Drinking And The Gym

The official policy on drinking is that no food or
beverages (alcoholic or otherwise) are allowed in
the gym. Of course, we know better. We are not
naive enough to think that there will be no drink-
ing; all we ask is that you be discreet. You will not be
allowed to bring coolers, kegs, etc. onto the floor.

You might want to plan ahead. By no means,
however, will there be unlimited drinking. Every-
thing must be within reason and rowdiness cannot
be tolerated. On Saturday the policy concerning
drinking will be considerably stricter. Security

Committee.

will do its best to minimize any drinking.

Security will remove anybody on the floor who is
not wearing his proper delegate card. Cards must
be worn during all three sessions. If a delegate
pass is lost another one can be obtained from the
Delegate Information Table setup by the Facilities

We do not have many extra cards and issuing a
new one is a pain so therefore stress to your
delegates not to lose them. To get a new one the
delegate and one of the delegation officers must re-
quest a new one at the table. Remember, cards
must be worn by everyone at all times.

In The Convention

Media and Public Relations
Director Guy Steuart is respon-
sible for the overall public-
relations and news-
dissemination efforts of the
Mock Convention. In_ this
respect, he and his committee
will work extensively with local
and national media represen-
tatives — in particular, with
W&L’s Assistant News Director
Gray Coleman, who will look
after the University’s own
media relations in this respect.
Mock Convention news will be
released to major sources in
each state in order to establish
political contacts and aid in
fund-raising. A variety of posi-
tions is still available on this im-
portant committee.

Speakers Chairman Dan
Westbrook handles all the ar-
rangements for the conven-
tion’s distinguished guests, both
before and during the actual

Police Set
Parade

Restrictions

The parade is always a good

time for everyone and this one
will be one of the biggest ever.
We are sincerely trying to put
as few restrictions on you as
possible. It has been made very
clear to us, however, by Chief
Kirby and people like him that
there are some regulations we
must follow. There can be no
drinking in the recreation area
where the floats will be
assembled (use good judgment
and don’t ask for trouble). We
are also responsible for clean-
up, so keep your trash to a
minimum and pick it all up.
Chief Kirby says that there is no
drinking allowed on the floats.
He is especially firm on this
point because there will be so
many children there. He will be
at the gate of the field and will
pull anyone off the floats who is
drinking or drunk. He has done
it in the past and I am sure he
will do it again. There will be
other policemen doing the same
along the route. Please
cooperate with our security peo-
ple — they are not trying to has-
sle anyone.

 

event. From travel and accom-
modations to security and
receptions, this group: will be
busy with candidates; platform
speakers and others throughout
the year.

Parade Chairman Donald
Swaggart and his committee,
last but not least, have the
awesome responsibility of plan-
ning and executing the tradi-
tional cavalcade through Lex-
ington on Friday morning.
Always one of the highlights of
the weekend, the parade often
sets the tone for the entire con-
vention — and, as in past years,
many special attractions are
being planned to set this parade
apart from its predecessors.

The state chairman and
members of his delegation have
the primary duty of developing
broad and effective expertise in
the nature and profile of politics
in their respective states, (Old-
time political commentators
might have compared them to
‘“‘ward bosses” who were saddl-
ed with the responsibility for
predicting the turn of a vote
within a hairline margin. )

The chairman recruits a
delegation himself and assigns
members to certain key posi-
tions such as_ secretary,
treasurer, and resea i

 

 

tor. After these preliminaries,
the group sets out to establish
close political contacts with of-
ficials in its state. In the end, it
is these all-important relation-
ships that are the foundation of
the convention's reputation for
accuracy. During the balloting
sessions, toll-free telephones
are installed in rows off the con-
vention floor — and it is no oddi-
ty tosee a W&L state chairman
talking in a frenzy to his real-
life counterpart back home
about the swing of a particular
state’s vote.

The state chairman is also ac-
countable for his delegation’s
financial obligations and fund-
raising efforts, through the
solicitation of funds from
donors in his state. The money
raised is used for payment of a
fixed fee to the Steering Com-
mittee, for postage and phone
expenses, and so forth. Finally,
the chairman (already burden-
ed though he may be) is also
committed to enter a float
representing his state. Con-
structed by the members of the
delegation and financed by
private donations, the state
floats are often extremely
elaborate, recently including a
double-decker Mississippi

Governor Ronald Reagan :
10960 Wilshire Boulevard - Suite 812
Los Angeles, California 90024

Dear Governor Reagan,

Because a Republican incumbent President, who by virtue of his
rank and candidacy had to be looked upon as the leader of the
Party, was defeated by his Democrat opponent, it is quite
reasonable to now regard you as the titular head of the Party
and the person most able to rebuild.

The enclosed copies of correspondence are rather self-explana- a
tory but do not encompass the full meaning of "truth in taxatrvon
or "ultimate consumer tax". It is practically impossible to
express all the ramifications of such a plan by correspondence.
The NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION has been alerted that this scheme
does exist, but it would be far better if the Republican party
would adopt it and use it to elect a Republican Congress in

1978. There can be no doubt that the greatest concern of all
Americans is taxation and the growing "Statism" propounded and
endorsed by the Party that was once the party of Thomas Jefferson.
The plan outlined does more than all the speeches by so called
Republican leaders about “broadening the base of the Party",
"getting grass roots support", etc., etc., etc. endlessly. It
provides the nucleus for a broad and revolutionary program that
could only result in Republican victory and complete reversal

of the SPEND and tax philosophy advocated by the Democrat Party.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Sincerely yours,

Cfarle AY yy

Honorable James L. Buckley

United States Senator

Suite 304, Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Buckley,

The enclosed copy of my July 20th letter to Lieutenant General
Arthur G. Trudeau, a Director of Magnetic Forming Corporation,
is somewhat indicative of my thoughts in regard to the following
prior to the Republican Convention,

Since the convention, however, which brought the people a campaign
which promises only the same old, shopworn, politics as usual -
without even a single new and fascinating idea, that could capture
the imagination of the people - it has been necessary to reflect
on who was best qualified to embrace a revolutionary new plan on
taxation and carry it through to the election of an Executive
branch and a Congress to put it into effect. The selection
narrowed to Senators Buckley and Helms. Helms because of his
close ties to the almost winning side of the Republican Party and
you because you were elected as neither a committed Republican or
Democrat but as the candidate of the Conservative Party, with
strong affinity with the right side of the Republican Party.

In searching for the means to get my message to you without dis-
closure to anyone else, I called your office and was able to talk
with one of your assistants, William Gavin, who recommended that

I write to you and mail the letter to his attention. But,

because I planned to be in Washington, Friday, August 25th, any-
how and a letter would not get there any sooner, I decided to hand
carry it to Mr. Gavin, I trust you will quickly see the merit of
what follows and will resolve to act on t.

1, Immeasurable words have been spoken and written about
returning government to the people, yet nothing has been done
about it.

2. Power to rule themselves cannot be accomplished until the
power to tax themselves has been returned to the people.

The first step in returning power to tax must be - TRUTH IN
TAXATION.

 

The Ring-tum Phi, May 8, 1980, Page 5

Brock To Open Convention

Washington and Lee alumnus and Chairman of
the Republican National Committee Bill Brock
will deliver the opening address at the Mock Con-
vention on May 9, 1980.

The role of the opening speaker is varied, but
Brock’s major task will be to present the view-
point of the Republican National Committee on the
1980 presidential race. In delivering the first ma-
jor address, Brock will also set the tone of excite-
ment for the convention.

Throughout his career, Bill Brock has recogniz-
ed the need for a “‘get-involved program”’ in the
determination of one’s future. After his gradua-
tion from Washington and Lee in 1953, he served as
an officer in the U.S. Navy. Following his military
service, he became a marketing executive for the
Brock Candy Co. of Chattanooga, Tenn.

It was not until 1960, at the age of 30, that Brock
placed a foot into the political arena. Along with
several associates, Brock became disillusioned
with the traditional one-party rule of the
Democrats in Tennessee. As a result he revitaliz-
ed the 3rd District Republican Committee with
emphasis on the young voter. By starting at the
“grass roots,’’ Brock successfully built a strong
precinct system and first instituted a ‘‘get involv-
ed program.”’ His activities quickly showed their
success in terms of the high financial support the

political organization received. Brock was then

named executive director of the state central com-
mittee.
After working for two years to form a strong

‘party organization, Bill Brock became the first

Republican since the 1920’s to be elected to Con-
gress from the third district of Tennessee. After
four terms in Congress, he challenged three-term
Democrat Albert Gore for a Senate seat. Involving
10,000 volunteers in his campaign, he won in an
upset victory. Along with Senator Brock, Ten-
nessee elected the first Republican Governor in a
half-century and five out of eight Republican Con-
gressional candidates.

In 1974, Brock was selected by his Senate col-
leagues to head the Republican Senatorial Cam-
paign Committee. With this background, it was on-
ly a matter of a few years before he was asked to
lead the entire party in re-establishing its base of
strength after the ravages of Watergate and the
Nixon pardon.

Brock inherited the leadership of a party that
traditionally placed their emphasis on strong
races at the top of the ticket — the glamourous
contests for president, governor and senate.
Brock’s appointment signalled an end to this
trend, and in the 1978 elections, the Republican
Party gained nearly 300 legislative seats across
the country, succeeding in halting the party’s
downhill slide at the grass-roots level.

Income taxes must be abolished and replaced with a tax system

their consumption, will be taxed at an equal rate for all.

Goods, wares, materials and commodities purchased for processing
into other forms for resale, or goods, wares, materials or
commodities purchased for resale in the same form, will be

In case of multiple purchases made from a central point for
widespread use, the point of use will be the point of purchase
and the point of purchase, the point of tax.

In the case of leased equipment, the lessor will pay the tax and
add it into the cost of the lease agreement.

When purchases are made on credit, the tax will be collected at

time of sale.

ALL taxes will be collected by local jurisdictions and passed up
to the higher echelons of government after retaining the portion
tax. Preemption of tax bases
by the Federal Government and State Governments need no longer

be feared.

With the power to tax returned to the people, the Power to
administer the multitude of programs instituted by the Federal
and State Governments must return to the people.

The former thoughts are not complete and certainly need embel-
lishment, but they should provide enough of a skeleton upon which
to build a revolutionary but sound program.

Thank you for your attention.

Much has been said about
vice-presidential possibilities
this year. Many presidential
candidates use the appointment
as a kind of trump card they
pull out near the end of a cam-
paign to keep voter enthusiasm
and wonder at its peak.

But what do people really
think of the job a vice-president
does. Here are a few descrip-
tions.

“It’s not worth a bucket of warm
spit.” —John Nance Garner

“It's indoor work with no heavy
lifting.” —Sen. Robert Dole (R-
Kan)

Peanuts
and Camelot

Democrats have an_ in-
teresting choice this year be-
tween peanuts and Camelot.
Campaigning on both sides has
been fierce and occasionally
despicable.

While one side criticizes cur-
rent job performance (or lack
of), the other camp questions
truthfulness and integrety.

But Teddy didn’t always have
these political views. Long
before throwing his hat into the
political arena he said, “Uh,
well, as I, uh, have said before,
uh, several times in fact, 1, uh, 1
expect the president to be, uh,
renominated, and I expect him to
be reelected and 1, uh, Lintend to
support him.”

It Doesn’t Pay

It just doesn’t pay to get out of
bed some mornings, especially
if you’re one of two men from
Morris Udall’s 1976 campaign
who were looking over Boston’s
Faneuil Hall a day before the
candidate was to make an ap-
pearance.

The two men somehow got
locked in at night and found all
the doors and windows on the
first floor sealed tight.
Desperate, they called Udall’s
secret service who in turn call-
ed local police.

The police arrived with a
large ring of keys. Unfortunate-
ly, none fit.

Later a hook-and ladder truck
rescued the pair by going
through a second-story window.

The operation took some time
— one man had a fear of
heights.

Reagan Still Front Runner

by Ed Taylor

Despite the fact he’d be near-
ly 70 when he took office in the
White House, a recent Time
magazine poll shows Ronald
Reagan as the front-runner for
the 1980 Republican presiden-
tial nomination.

Ronald Reagan was born on
February 6, 1911 in Tampico,
Ill. As a child he became fond of
acting and later attended
Eureka College, a small Chris-
tian Church School near Peoria.
He graduated in 1932 and took a
sports announcing job in Des
Moines, Iowa at WHO, where he
became known as “Dutch”
Reagan.

While covering the Chicago
Cubs at spring training in
California, he was asked to take
a screen test and from this his
movie career began. He starred
in such films as ‘‘Knute Rockne
— All American’”’ and ‘‘King’s
Row.”’ Although he didn’t win
any Academy Awards, Reagan
utilized his acting career to
sharpen a stage presence that
became a tremendous asset for
him in politics.

During his acting career,
Reagan was a liveral Democrat
but he later gained fame as an
energetic spokesman proclaim-
ing Opposition to centralized
government and support for a
hard-nosed stance by the United
States in foreign affairs. He
strongly supported the free-
enterprise system and virosous-
ly opposed big government.

In 1966, persuaded by friends
from the movie industry,
Reagan ran for governor of
California. He was not given
much chance in the race, but
when the votes were tallied he
had swamped _ incumbent
Democrat Edmund G. Brown
by nearly 845,000 votes.

To put to rest the belief that
his election was a fluke, Reagan
won re-election in 1970 by near-
ly 500,000 votes.

Reagan left the governor’s of-
fice in 1974 and in addition to his
unsuccessful presidential cam-
paign in 1976 he has prospered
as a lecturer, radio commen-
tator and syndicated collum-
nist. He now lives in Pacific
Palisades, California with his
wife, Nancy. They have two
children; a daughter Patricia,
26, and a son, Ronald, 20.

As a front-runner in the 1980
Republican presidential
nomination Reagan’s,
strategists feel he must start off
winning or he will quickly fade |
from the Public’s favor.
Therefore, a few early primary |
victories seem to be a necessity |
for Reagan if he expects to win}
the Republican nomination at |
the 1980 convention in Detroit. |

As for the age issue, one sup- |
porter said ‘If we win a few |
early primaries, it'll disappear. |
If we lose a few, it’I] killus.” |

Profile.

George Bush

by Carlo Carlozzi, Jr.

After having been considered
three times for the vice
presidency by Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, George Bush
announced in early May of this
year his Presidential can-
didacy. His announcement was
somewhat overdue. No
Republican aspirant started
earlier than Bush. In 1978 alone,
he toured 42 states laying down
his grass roots organization
which he claims will get him the
nomination in 1980.

George Herbert Walker Bush,
54, is a man with a deep sense of
noblesse oblige. However,
unlike most of his predecessors
of the old Eastern establish-
ment of the Republican party,
George Bush is no liberal, not
even a moderate. Rather, Bush
is running pretty much as a
standard conservative.

His credentials are impre-
sive: Greenwich County Day
School, Andover, youngest pilot
in the Navy and graduated Phi
Beta Kappa in 2 '2 years from
Yale. While at Yale, he was also
a member of Skull and Bones,
captain of the baseball team
and President of the Senior

Class.

Mr. Bush is the former-
almost-everything. He served
two terms as a member of Con-
gress, from Texas, former en-
voy to Peking, former CIA
Director, former Republican

National Chairman in_ the
darkest Watergate days. He
performed all of these jobs with
ability, if not always brilliance.

In his declaration of can-
didacy, on May 1, 1979, Mr.
Bush said he wasn’t promising
‘‘a new deal”’ or ‘‘a new Foun-
dation’, but rather, he was of-
fering ‘‘a new candor.”’ Mostly
due to his background, Mr.
Bush has been speaking almost
entirely about foreign policy.
What he says about foreign
policy is generally tough and
conservative.

Bush opposed the Panama
Canal treaties, and now re-
mains cautious on the Salt II
treaty. Bush contends that his
CIA assignment fortified his
belief that the Russian
challenge is dangerous. On the
Salt II treaty, Bush stated that
“the fact is that under this trea-
ty we are virtually unable to
monitor whether the Soviets
comply with its terms...when it
comes to vertification of Salt II,
Jimmy Carter will ask us to
trust the Soviets as he once ask-
ed us to trust him...But I
say...that a treaty that can not
be verified tomorrow shouldn’t
be ratified today.”

George Bush favors the ERA,
thinks that the CIA has been
undercut and opposes a tax cut
without a cut in federal spen-
ding. He favors. nuclear

development, favors a shared
reduction in government
regulation of business, a
phaseout of some of the social
programs dating to the
Kennedy-Johnson years. Bush
favors a supply-oriented energy
program including _ oil-price
decontrol and a ‘“‘windfall pro-
fits’’ tax with a strong
‘“plowback”’ provision to en-
courage oil development, and
sharp tax cut to move the
economy forward.

A big problem for George
Bush is the fact that he is not a
household name. This, though,
can be rectified as the elections
of 1976 showed us with the
nomination and eventual elec-
tion of Jimmy Carter to the
White House.

Depending on the poll read,
George Bush’s name can go
from non-existent to leading the
field of names. A June
Washington Post poll of 1,976
Republican delegates showed
Bush running third, at 11 per-
cent, following former Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan and John
Connally. Ina survey conducted
by the Christian Science
Monitor in late July of 1979, of
Republican leaders, George
Bush led the field as their
nominee for president, with 27
percent, over 24 percent for
Reagan and 22 for Connally.

Republican Party Changes Strategy

by Marc Birenbaum

Believe it or not, there was a
time when political commer-
cials were simple, cut and dry
advertisements — a speech to a
special interest group, an at-
tack on a supposed weakness of
an opponent or an ad depicting
your favorite candidate as the
All-American all supporters
truly knew him or her to be.

Then came the advent of the
presidential contender’s media
blitz, described so well in books
like The Selling of The Presi-
dent, 1968, The People Machine,
The Image Candidates and The
Political Persuaders. >

Even this year’s campaign
showed brief glimpses of a good
candidate commercial. Sen.

Howard Baker produced one of
the most effective and con-
troversial commercials, when
he responded to an Iranian’s
question while stumping in
Iowa. When George Bush was
interviewed on ‘‘Sixty
Minutes,”’ his campaign was
caught in an embarassing situa-
tion when the CBS crew filmed
Bush’s people re-enacting a
welcoming party at a New
England airport.

Now the Republican party
itself is sinking $5 million in an
ad campaign with the general
theme: ‘‘Vote Republican. For
a change.”’ — a theme reminis-
cient of the 1946 campaign in
which the GOP captured both
chambers of Congress.

unique is that it seeks to provide
an idealogical theme for the
Republican Party as a whole,
and is very similar to the
British Conservative party’s
media campaign of last spring.

Perhaps you’ve seen one of
the Republican ads. In early
February, the first, entitled
“Land of Hope,’’ aired national-
ly on ABC. The five-minute
message was about present pro-
blems facing the nation: Laws
that restrict productivity, infla-
tion, and overtaxation caused
by government spending.
“What went wrong, what went
wrong...in the Congress of the
United States,’ says the ad.
“But tomorrow can be dif-
ferent...We have the resources
to restore prosperity.”’

Throughout February, five
other messages, varying in
time from 30 seconds to five
minutes, appeared nationally.

“Earlier, our test marketing
of the messages produced
favorable responses from the
previewers,”’ said Republican
National Chairman Bill Brock.
“We believe the. television
messages will help promote the
growing feeling among
Americans that the Republican
party can do a better job than
the Democrats in restoring
stability to America — in both
domestic and_ international
areas.”’

These commercials are only a
part of the first phase of a three-
part plan, which will culminate
in June.

You Can’t Make Chicken Salad...

It’s Mock Convention Weekend! The culmina-
tion of years of work! Parades! Demonstrations!
You name it, they’ve got it.

Of course, there is one minor problem.

Unfortunately, an authentic imitation of our na-
tional political process tends to intensify the feel-
ing that we are all slightly insane in this country.

Now it is expected that all so called “‘intelligent’’
people will rag on the candidates selected. Lord
Bryce is quoted. The political pundits shake their
heads at the ignorance of the general population.
Reforms are proposed and then forgotten.

Yet this year’s results, more than most, deserve
the abuse heaped upon it.

As the Mock Convention will reaffirm, old

rockin’ Ronny will get the nod from the GOP. On
the other side, we have old Mr. Incompetent.
Then, suppoesedly in the middle, we have the
alleged intellectual, Preacher John.

These are our choices for what is probably the
most powerful position in the Western world.

Now it is not the Mock Convention’s fault that it
is forced to work with such material. Its purpose
of attempting this simulation of national follv.

I guess it is democracy, and that the alter-
natives aren’t so hot, but it seems that our
presidential nomination process is just a tad
ridiculous.

There—I’ve proven that I can be just as big a
snob as really neat, respected columnists.

Alben Barkley’s Famous Last Words

by Robert Keefe

There are lots of errors con-
nected with Washington and
Lee. Such a large quantity of
the mail meant for us goes to
Lexington, Kentucky, that the
post office there has a rubber
stamp to redirect it. The story is
told that many years ago, at his
first faculty meeting, a new
president expressed his
pleasure at arriving on the cam-
pus of William and Mary. We
ourselves have a plaque on
campus on which the name of
another man, who was our
president for 30 years, is
misspelled. Half the world
thinks the statue of Cyrus Mc-
Cormick on the Front Campus
is really of Robert E. Lee, and
the other half thinks Lee is
buried inside Edward Valen-
tine’s marble Recumbent
Statue in the chapel.

Perhaps no error is more per-
sistent or widespread, however,
than the one about Alben
Barkley’s famous Last Words.

We ourselves have committed
the error more frequently than
anyone else.

It is all the more a shame
because Barkley’s Last Words
must rank, by any yardstick,
among history’s most a propos.
(Contrast them, for instance,
with Elvis Presley’s, uttered to
his girlfriend: “Baby, I’m going
into the library to read."’)

In fact, others than us at
Washington and Lee also
regard Barkley’s Last Words as
transcendent. In their book The
Best (1974), Professors Peter

Passell and Leonard Ross label
them “Best Exit Line.’’ But
they misquote Barkley. They
have the occasion wrong. And
they say it happened in Lex-
ington, Kentucky.

Passell and Ross meant well.

(“*...A misquotation set in the
wrong locale at the wrong
time,” NBC newsman Lloyd
Dobyns, °57 wrote to Time
magazine, ‘“‘which must set
some sort of Best Record for
Most Errors in_ Shortest
Apace.”’)

So far this year, we ourselves
have issued at least one news
release and one brochure that
have the Last Words wrong too.

It is Henry Mencken’s “‘Law
of Millard Fillmore’s Bathtub”’
that does it to us and to
everyone.

It snuck into print once, and
it’s been there ever since.

Our boss, however, possibly
alone among the _ whole
populace, knew we and
everyone were wrong then,
wrong now, and likely to be
wrong forever. That’s why he’s
the boss.

So after who-knows-how-
many repetitions of the error,
we were prodded actually to go
toa primary source. (Apparent-
ly, no one else had had a similar
notion for years, either. It took
two days to track down our own
recording of the Last Words. )

And here is the Straight
Truth, finally.

Alben Barkley was at
Washington and Lee (Lex-
ington, Virginia), on April 30,

suspension and thick rubber
flooring.

Putting the Clydesdales
through their precise paces is
demanding. Although the ex-
pert hitch drivers make it look
easy, guiding eight tons. of
horsepower is a far cry from
power steering.

“It’s having 60 or 70 pounds of
weight in your hands at all
times; you’ve got to maintain
constant tension on the reins or
you lose contact with the
horses,” says one veteran
driver.

The horses are harnessed in
such a way as to give each
almost complete freedom of

movement forward and
backward. Driver skill alone
determines pace, position and
movement. Both the driver and
assistant have their hands full
continuously. While one drives,
the other is busily straightening
the reins. The stress of guiding
12-plus tons of horse and wagon
is so great that drivers general-
ly trade duties often during an
appearance.

The “official” home in St.
Louis of the Clydesdales is
perhaps the most lavish
quarters ever designed for
horses. In 1885, Anheuser-Busch
founder Adolphus Busch built
an ornate $35,000 building on the
St. Louis brewery grounds to
house the family horses. The
Clydesdales’ stable is one of the
three buildings within the 70-
block Anheuser-Busch head-
quarters complex in South St.
Louis which has_ been
designated a registered Na-
tional Historic Landmark.

1956, to speak to the student
body’s Mock Democratic Con-
vention.

But he never said he would
rather be a servant in the house
of the Lord than sit at the feet of
the mighty, and then keel over.

Almost, but not quite.

The problem is with the feet.
If one is a servant in anyone’s
house, after all, one has no
choice but to sit at the feet of the
mighty.

It was just a little more than
three years after the end of
Truman administration, after
the end of Barkley’s vice
presidency. The man who coin-
ed the word Veep confessed to
his student audience that once
upon a time, he’d aspired to
even higher office. But, he said,
no longer did he entertain such
ambitions. (‘“They could go fur-
ther and do worse,” he quoted
Thomas B. Reed, ‘‘and it seems
they will.’’)

Someone in the audience yell-

ed, ‘‘Aw, come on, y’ole
firehorse!”’
BARKLEY: “I think I am

sufficiently alert to present con-
ditions to know that all fire ap-
paratuses are now automotive,
not horse-drawn. (Laughter and
applause)...But I no longer
have any personal interest (in
standing for highest office). I

people for half a century...I

Convention abounds!

Make no mistake about it
—the primary focus of the 1980
Mock Republican Convention
will be to select the eventual
Republican presidential
nominee. Even so, the weekend
has always been an entertain-

carnival atmosphere which
captures the true spirit of the
“‘real’’ political gatherings in
the summer.

vention parade on Friday morn-
ing — with more than 50 floats,
marching bands, ever-present
elephants and U.S. Sen. John
Warner as 1980 Parade Mar-
Shal.

There can be no true pagean-
try without regalia and decora-
tions — hence, a wide variety of
souvenir items have been
created for the 1980 convention.
Included in the group — all
creations of the Public Rela-
tions office of the convention
—are bumper stickers, T-shirts,
lapel buttons, commemorative
plastic grain cups, posters, and
matches.

And best of all —-a novelty to
conventions past and present
—a special edition, Mock Con-
vention bourbon. The liquor
comes in a 750-milliliter bottle.
Made by the Jim Beam
Distillery Co., the bourbon will
be sold through Lexington’s
ABC Store starting in mid-
April, as will the rest of the 1980
souvenirs. Further information
may be obtained in the Mock
Convention office, 703-463-9111,

The His
The Mock (

The tradition of W&L mock convention began
unpretentiously enough as a class project sug.
gested by W. Jett Lauck, an assistant professor of
economics and politics at Washington and Lee.

students who only a few weeks before had heard

Gold” speech at a Lexington skating rink. Bryan
appeared as part of the traveling Chautaugua
series, those carnival-like events which brought
speakers and entertainers to rural communities
early in this century. The enthusiastic students)
garnered enough support for Bryan to obtain the
nomination on the first ballot — the only first-
ballot victory in the history of the Mock Conven-
tion. Two months later, the delegates to the actual
Democratic National Convention, meeting in
Denver, made good on that original prediction.

The first Mock Convention was of such little note
to the editor of the student newspaper, the Ring-
tum Phi that he chose to carry only a brief account
of it on page two of the paper. The Lexington
Gazette, however, reported on. its front page that
“the young gentlemen entered into the meeting
with the zest of seasoned politicians plus the en-
thusiasm of collegians.”’ If we are to believe the
first-hand accounts, an imprudent combination of
political ‘‘zest’’ and collegiate ‘‘enthusiasm’’ pro-
duced volatile results. The ’08 convention saw the
only political dispute among delegates that led to
actual fisticuffs. After the nomination of Bryan,
members of the Kansas delegation, who had sup-
ported the candidacy of Minnesota Governor John
A. Johnson, in no uncertain terms invited the
Bryan supporters to join them outside the gy...
nasium, where, according to newspaper accounts,
a “heated set-to’’ ensued. When it was through,
those Johnson supporters who remained healthy
enough gathered at the engineering building, held
their own convention, and nominated the ‘‘man of
the hour’’ — in their eyes at least Governor
Johnson.

There is historical evidence that the Mock Con-
vention which produces a nominee in the early
balloting stands the best chance of having
predicted the correct candidate. The '52 conven-
tion, which went only four ballots, appears to be a
model of how, in theory, every Mock Convention
should turn out.

The delegates, including senior economics ma-
jor David Constine, chairman of the California
delegation, had done their homework. Constine
had established a correspondence with Governor
Earl Warren, who would later head the California

Those conventions which have made correct
predictions even after extended balloting have
often done so because of some fortuitous oc-
currence. For example, in 1960 Adlai Stevenson
accumulated enough votes to win on the fourth
ballot — but a shortage of adding machines
delayed Mock Convention officials from ruling
him a winner, and in the interim several delega-
tions switched their votes.

delegations present. That summer, the
Democratic National Convention, meeting in New
York City, conducted a protracted and hotter ver-
sion of what had taken place in Lexington that spr-
ing. There were 103 ballots before a consensus was
reached on a nominee — a record that still stands.
.|By the time it was all over the Democrats had
passed a dry platform and had selected the same
“wet” candidate, John W. Davis. Before the con-
vention adjourned, the band struck up the fight

in |ing;’’ it became his campaign theme song.

Fundraising

 

The Finance and Develop-
ment Committee of the 1980
Mock Convention, under the
direction of Economics major
Richard Makepeace _ since
November 1979, is responsible
for the accumulation of funds
from corporations, foundations
and the exclusive ‘‘Committee
of 100.’ Total contributions
since the endof the 1976 Mock
Democratic Convention have
totalled approximately $24,000.
Even before the committee was
officially organized, it may be
noted, the convention was the
recipient of a most generous
donation from the Sumners
Foundation of Dallas.

In its attempt to solicit more
grants of this type, the ‘“F&D”
Committee has pursued cor-
porate contacts around the
country. Makepeace, a senior
from Greensboro, N.C., notes
that “the committee has con-
centrated primarily on those
foundations which would have a
natural interest in a political
science endeavor. To a large
degree, we have concentrated
our efforts in Virginia, realizing
that corporations within the
state are more familiar with the
convention’s reputation for ac-
curacy than potential con-
tributors a greater distance
from Washington and Lee.
Nevertheless, we have spent a
great deal of time carrying out
special out-of-state work — and
donations have begun to come
in from that area as well.”

Makepeace acknowledged

1976 entry) and a “Land of Oz”’
float complete with Dorothy —
in ruby-red Topsiders, of course
— and a band of costumed Mun-
chkins (Kansas’ first-place en-
try in 1976).

State chairmen already ap-
pointed and organizing their
delegations include the follow-
ing, who should be contacted by
those who wish to join a par-
ticular state’s group:

that larger corporate donations
have been limited to date. ‘But
this should not be seen as a sign
of disinterest,’ he added. ‘“‘Due
to the fact that these larger
bodies meet at longer intervals
each year, we should be hearing
quite a few responses after the
spring meeting season is clos-
ed.”

The individual state
chairmen and the delegation
members pursue smaller and
more traditional areas of fund
raising. By contacting parents,
small businesses and friends of
the convention, the states as a
unit have raised $14,000 with
convention weekend more than
six weeks away.

In some cases, a state chair-
man initiates contact with a
corporation in his area. Those
which express more than a
passing interest in the event are
referred to the F&D Committee
for further contact. This pro-
cedure has paid off in a number

of instances — most notably,
the Ethyl Corporation and
Philip Morris Inc. of Richmond,
both of which have made
substantial donations.

A third source of revenue
managed by F &D is the Conven-
tion’s ‘“‘Committee of 100,” a
select group composed of W&L
alumni who have worked on the
Steering Committees of past
conventions. To date, this group
has given in excess of $1,000 to
the 1980 Mock Convention
—many stating their gifts are in
return for the valuable ex-
perience and practical educa-
tion they received while serving
in their respective conclave.

And these methods are just a
sampling — other means of
fund raising have ranged from
cocktail parties to door-to-door
solicitation. In all, F&D is one of
the primary reasons for op-
timism among staffers in the
1980 Mock Convention, pro-
viding an ample budget for a
unique educational experience.

Tom Wolfe Speaks At Contact

by John Wells

Tom Wolfe, a 1951 graduate of
Washington and Lee and author
of a number of highly praised
books (of greatest renown The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and
more recently The Right Stuff)
addressed an enthusiastic au-
dience in Lee Chapel yesterday.
His appearance was sponsored
by Contact.

Nattily dressed, not in white
but in a three piece pale yellow
suit with thin blue-grey stripes,
the returning alumnus main-
tained the audience’s interest
and highlighted his remarks
wtih colorful, witty descrip-
tions, usually about modern ex-
cess. The substance of his talk,
he explained, dealt with an un-
published chapter of his latest
success, The Right Stuff
entitled a ‘‘National History of
Bravery.”

Wolfe commented that since
the beginning of this century,
there has been “‘practically no
literature of a serious nature’
about the modern military hero.
The perception of it has been
reduced to a set of stereotypes
on television, in MASH and
Gomer Pyle, which depict the
military man as a “‘facist brute
of an idiot.” He noted that the
risks of active service fliers are
almost as grest as those taken
by calvery men in the 19th cen-
tury.

The New York City journalist
said that when he observed the
launching of the last manned
space mission, Apollo 17,
among a crowd of Merv Griffin-
calibre celebrities, he asked
himself, ‘what makes a man
capable of ascending into a
huge rocket and waiting for so-
meone to light the fuse?’’ After

many years of research and
analysis, he found hte answer,
which is the title of his new
book.

Wolfe illustrated an example
of the ‘right stuff,’ as he does
in the book, in a particularly
humorous account of being
soothed during a mechanically
troubled commercial flight by
the chuckling, avuncular drawl
of the airline captain. As he
watched the wings unloading
fuel into the ocean (laughed off
by the pilot as unnecessary)
and was instructed by the
stewardess to kneel and remove
his glasses, Wolfe said ‘‘I was in
two frames of mind. On one side
I was thinking ‘this is it,’ but on
the other hand, if it were so
dire, ‘how could the captain, the
man who knows the actual
situation most intimately...how
could he keep on drawlin and
chuck chuckling...?’’’ This
courage, displayed during a
possibly fatal mid-air crisis, is
what the writer says epitomizes
the concept.

In the middle of his talk, and
again near the conclusion,
Wolfe quoted the former Chur-
chill aide, Lord Moran, who
wrote that the only way to have
brave men in battle (or
presumably, in orbit) is to
make sure that there is no
honorable alternative. Wolfe
said that the phrase stuck with
him, and that it is the secret of
routine bravery, even during
unpopular wars in this century.

In person, perhaps more so
than in media appearances,
Wolfe comes across as easy-
going, intelligent, and sharply
funny. His literary
achievements are noteworthy
for their originality and diversi-
ty of content.

 

EC Hears Health Complaints

by John G. Billmyre

According to Scott Williams,
a member of the Student Health
Committee who appeared
before the Executive Commit-
tee Monday night, ‘‘some
dispute exists as to whether Bill
Calore received treatment at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital
during February’s mid-winter
break.”

Calore, a first-year law stu-
dent, injured his head during
the undergraduate mid-winter
break.

Last week Calore told the EC
that he had been charged for
treatment by the hospital even
though he did not receive treat-
ment.

Whether he received treat-
ment will probably remain
unknown, but the university has
agreed to settle the bill for the
disputed treatment with the
Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

The EC requested that a
member of the Student Health
Committee attend the meeting
after it learned last week that
Calore did not get a response
from the Committee after he fil-
eda complaint:

Williams said Calore’s com-
plaint went unanswered be-
cause there are sO many com-

plaints from the law school that
they are dealt with as a group.

According to Williams, of the
25 complaints about Health Ser-
vice at W&L, 15 are from Law
School Students who are dis-
pleased with the infirmary be-
ing closed during under-
graduate breaks.

The Student Health Commit-
tee Representative said the
Committee has dealt with all
the complaints it has received
this year.

A regular Health Committee
meeting, according to Williams,
consists of Dean of Students
Lewis G. John reading com-
plaints about the health ser-
vices to the Committee.

Williams left the impression
that Committee members then
investigate the complaints.

He said he would recommend
to next year’s Committee that
all complaints be responded to
on an individual basis.

Williams also said that he
handed out a survey to 50 law
studénts': and’ received a

response from 16 students.

The randomly selected law
students, said Calore, respond-
ed that they preferred having a
doctor available for seven hours
a day in his office to two hours a
day in the infirmary during the
undergraduate break.

Under the University’s agree-
ment with Dr. Feddeman, the
doctor is to give the law stu-
dents preferential treatment
during the undergraduate
break.

Ariel Editor Chris Fay gave
his publication’s monthly report
and announced the publication
should be ready by next week.

The Journalism Lab Press is
printing 400 copies of the 52-
page literary magazine for ap-
proximately $700.

The Ariel has about $957 left
in its budget, according to Fay.

EC President Steve Abraham
reported that he talked with
President Huntley about the
possibility of hiring more
security for next year and
changing locks in the freshman
dorms.

Abraham said Huntley

believes changing the locks in
the freshman dorms would not
be a good solution to the securi-
ty problems jn the dorms, since
dorm counselors would still
have keys, which could be lost
or stolen.

Abraham said there is a
possibility that the security
force could be beefed up, and
added that freshmen may be
provided with padlocks for their
closet doors.

Sophomore Representative
Jim Wenke said he did not think
padlocks would help much since
the doors could still be lifted off
of the hinges.

In the final business of the
evening, Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative, said a ODK
leadership forum will be held
this spring.

The purpose of the forum, ac-
cording to Keesler, “‘is to allow
new campus leaders to meet
one another and to discuss per-
tinent problems.

Keesler emphasized that no
student funds will be spent on
the closed forum.

He added that an open forum
is being planned for,next fall. -

Spring term and the Michelin
man couldn’t be happier.

Spring term is associated
with several traditional ac-
tivities, and one of them is tub-
ing. Students engaged in this
perilous sport risk life, limb,
and property to bounce through
rapids and land on sharp rocks.
Double hydraulics and sea
monsters add to the romance of
the sport.

The first day that the sky
behind House Mountain is blue,
the students sack the tire stores
for all the large inner tubes
available. And on that first day
every year there will be novices
(read “freshmen’’) who buy
small tubes — the kind the pros
carry beer in — and end up
either at Stonewall General
with a busted coccyx or lost
forever in the jaws of Devil’s
Kitchen.

Tubing trips start with about
six people and their over-
inflated tubes all piled into one

town, and promptly stops on the
other side of the Maury at East
Lex to buy beer or just to stand
around in the walk-in cooler.
The car is re-packed and with
the additional weight of two
cases of beer, cans please, the
fearless adventurers set off.

The ride out is always an
adventure, part of the pregame
warmup. The driver finds
himself shifting gears, holding
a tube on the roof when the
string breaks, trying to tune in
WLUR, and sucking on a Natty
Bo for the road.

In the back is always the
uninitiated freshman, sitting on
the hump with his chin below
his knees, holding his towel,
shades, Sea’n’Ski, shoes, radio,
and everyone else’s beer. His
face grows paler as he hears the
horror stories about those who
went before him, those who did
not return. }

He is made to recall the pla-
ques in Lee Chapel. He is told of
the wrestler who was sucked

car. Trucks are nice, but the car
usually ends up being an Opel.
No matter, the tubes are tied on
top or held out the window by
passengers.

Some tubers depart with
tubes deflated, to be pumped up
at Rockbridge Baths, but there
is still the problem of getting
them to Goshen from there.

So everyone is packed into the
car and heads out of town, past
the Snu lodge where the civic-
minded ones hold _ tornado

until the river went down (he

who went down the wrong side
of the run and was sucked back
under a waterfall so that all that
could be seen of him was his red
Converse in the churning froth.
Closer to Goshen and the
freshman’s face has_ turned
from one of fear to one of pain;
he has a muscle cramp and also
needs to get out for a minute but
the driver won’t stop and his
fellow passengers keep jabbing

him in the kidneys. Finally, the
rapids unfold beside the road
and everyone peers over the
right side of the car, remember-
ing the runs and looking for new
rocks.

As Laurel Run approaches,
there is the annual fight as to
where is the best place to start
and whether Devil’s Kitchen is
just above or is just below the
campground. (It doesn’t mat-
ter; it just seems so profes-
sional to have names for your
rapids. )

Speaking of professionals,
you can always tell a profes-
sional tuber because he stashes
beer along the river as he drives
up it so he can retreive it on the
way down.

So it’s into the water. Some
plop down into their tubes and
bear the sudden shock; others
ease in slowly, dipping each
part of their undercarriage a
millimeter at a time. Those who
take the latter approach often
find themselves still dry at the
top of a rapid and get the sud-
den dunking anyway. Some
never get wet and ride the
whole way with their hands and
feet on the tube, like inverted
spiders.

The top of a rapid separates
the different personalities of the
tube team. Some just go with
the flow, never paddling, since
each hand holds a beer, and run
fast to the bottom of the sluice.
Others backpaddle to see what
everyone else is going to do and
end up too exhausted to fight the
ride down and end up over the
waterfall they sought to avoid.
Others shout, ‘‘Go left! Go
left!’’ while they go right and
make it, while the freshman
who took the advice is sacrific-
ed to the angry river.(The river
is only appeased if he is a virgin

— about half the time. )

Every tuber will at one time
experience the Major Loss. This
particular form of locomotion,
sans tube, entails gently feeling
the bottom of a long run of white
water with the back of one’s
head, while one’s legs and
tubeshoes flash in the noon-day
sun. A pro will come up with all
his teeth, and most importantly
his tube hat, at the end of the
run.

If the team starts above the
campground it will usually stop
there to drop off its dead and
pick up more beer. The runs
above the campground are fast
and rocky, much rougher than
the ones below, and the scrape
rate is high.

Below the campground, for
those that venture further, are
some of the best big runs. The
first involves a double-S, two
drops, and several hydraulics
which will suck in a tube or
tuber and never let it go. This is
often called Devil’s Kitchen.

Below this stretch is a nice
straight run along a flat wall.

Below that are some small runs
and lots of smooth sailing, and
lots of time to pick up that
stashed beer.

The tubers find a spot where
the road comes close to the
water and climb out. Some
teams take two cars and leave
one at the exodus point for easy
return to the main vehicle.
Others thumb back up river,
which is fine as long as you are
not picked up by any of the mill
workers on their way to the late
shift; they like to run tubers
through their own course at the
lumber mill, feet first, of
course.

The return to Lexington is
always a fast one when the tube
team relizes that they have ten
minutes to make dinner. The
pros compare the runs to last
year or last week. The fresh-
men are ready to show their
scars to the ladies down the
road that night.

And the river, well, it never
gives up its dead...

Raves For ‘The States’

given a little more of themselves in concert.

As a contrast to The States, a west coast band
calledSpider, also one album veterans in the same
situation as The States , has picked a very dif-

by Mark Kinniburgh

Last week’s SAB concert in front of Doremus
Gym was a rare and excellent opportunity to see
great talent at a very low price. What more could
you ask for? We had lacrosse, tunes and beer and
it didn’t cost a thing!

I have yet to hear any substantial complaints
about any facet of the whole production outside of
one question as to why more students weren’t in
attendance.

The States opened up the festivities with a set of
hard, semi-Styx new wave that did little to help
their record sales around Lexington. The States
are a funny story that is duplicated around the
country daily by record companies unable to find
a “killer’’ band to gain national recognition with
their first album. Like The States, most of the
rookie bands are regional successes with little, if
any, Stage experience.

The gamble that a record label takes in this case
is that after one album, along with a tour or two,
the water will be ready for a second, and hopeful-
‘ly, asuccessful album.

I don’t like to criticize, but The States are head-
ed the wrong direction. Although quite blessed
with talent, most evident through the lead singer
Jimmy McDonnell, they blew a chance at W&L to
really floor an audience with a show.

It makes me wonder if they do that all the time
That is, are all the performances they give as
lack-lustre and emotionless? Especially with a
great audience such as W&L audiences usually
are, one would think that The States could have

ferent route.

 

All That Jazz — a self-indulgent oddity by Bob Fosse, an
autobiographical backstage musical with polished production and
energetic visuals. Roy Scheider was oscar-nominated for his per-
formance as the central character, Joe Gideon, a hard-driving, ag-
gressive, pill-popping filmmaker and choreographer who finally
suffers a breakdown and undergoes open heart surgery, an opera-
tion which Fosse has permrtted the audience to closely observe.
Surpassed only by Kramer vs Kramer in numbers of Academy
Awards this year (four in editing, score, costume design, and art
direction). Directed and co-written by Fosse, with Jessica Lange,
Ann Renking, Leland Palmer, and Ben Vereen. Starts tomorrow at

 

First, Spider features superior talent and
songwriting, both of which are keys to a new
band’s longevity. Secondly, Spider’s first album is
a hit — it is very, very good.

I would rate it as a ‘“‘Best Debut” record and ad-
vise buyers that the stuff is habit forming. Rarely
does a new band give you all the energy of a
Jefferson Airplane with the musical hooks of
Kansas or Pink Floyd.

Part of the lure of Spider is the female vocalist,
who defies current practice of cutesy, vicious or
sexpot vocal inflection, and opts for her own
urgent, concert-like projection. My favorite so far
is “Little Darlin’,” a nicely woven tune with spec-
torish drums and a very clean mix.

Vocally it is magnificent — lots of talking,
singing and catchy background vocals. Nothing
new wave about Spider, they have the foundations
for a long future in rock.

NOTES: Grateful Dead’s latest is out and ready
for purchase. There are some nice efforts on the
album, but nothing hits me yet...Pete Townsend’s

- new album “Empty Glass” is very nice and whoish,
but with the brains of Townsend behind all the in-
struments, “Empty Glass’’ is a winner... Thanks to
Louisiana Leroux for the best thinking rock we’ve
had at W&L in the last five years...their new
album will be out on Capitol records this summer.

Little Darlings — Praise has not been abundant for this story of
two teen-age girls at summer camp, which attempts to entice
patrons with a ludicrous ad campaign (‘‘Don’t let the title fool
you,” the posters snicker, ‘The bet is on — whoever loses her
virginity first wins”). Tatum O’Neal, who looks nice, but whose
talent has not ripened with age, and T.V. actress Kristy McNichol

The Washington & Lee
Generals continued their im-
pressive season by routing the
Roanoke Maroons’ lacrosse
team, currently ranked second
in the nation in Division II, by a
score of 15-6.

The Generals showed no mer-
cy as they gained revenge for
losses to Roanoke over the past
two years. The Generals out-
shot the Maroons, kept them
primarily on defense, and came
away with yet another scoring
streak, this one bringing ten
consecutive goals.

Roanoke held tough for the
first quarter, due mainly to to
the play of its goalie, John
Neurohr. W&L shots which
Neurohr did not block bounced
over the goal due to the hard-
ness of the Maroons’ crease.

‘The first quarter ended 2-1 in
Roanoke's favor.

The second quarter marked
the start of the scoring streak
which lasted until the latter half
of the third quarter. Rob
Staugaitt is decided enough was
enough and scored twice after
John Sancilio tied the score at 2-
all. This gave the Generals a 4-2
halftime lead.

Chris Kearney led the scoring
in the third quarter by by con-
necting three times, while
Roman Kupecky, George San-
tos. Art Caltrider and Geotf
Brent each scored once. The put
the Generals into a comman-
ding 12-3 lead going into the
fourth period.

Koaunoke managed to score
three more times in the fourth
quarter, but not before W&L
had also put in three more
tallies. Bob Carpenter,

The 1980 edition of the varsity
baseball team has finished its
season and now, on the surface
it appears as if this year wasn't
any different from last year or
any of the other umpteen losing
seasons in Washington and Lee
history, '

This, however, is not true.

Improvements occurred in all
facets of the team this year ex-
cept in the “win” column. The
overall record was 5-13, which
is one better than last year’s
4-17 mark. '

Losing seasons aren't any-
thing new to W&L’s baseball
since the school has had only 20
winning years out of over sixty
seasons of play. And only three

tos is second) each scored to
end the game at 15-6 in favor of
the Generals.

The Generals continued to
play impressive lacrosse, fin-
ding and exploiting their oppo-
nent’s weaknesses as well as
rotating players to the fullest
extent. With a record of 10-1 and
only two games left in the
season, a playoff bid for W&L is
now virtually assured.

 

Generals 17
Rutgers 7

 

by Robert Massie

The Generals continued their
undefeated record at home and
regained the No, 3 position in
the USILA Lacrosse poll by
humiliating Rutgers University
17-7 before a Spring Weekend
crowd of almost 3,000 on Wilson
Field last Saturday.

The Generals’ lacrosse team
put together one of their best
games this season and shined in
every aspect. ‘‘We played a
solid 60 minutes. of lacrosse,”
commented coach Jack Emmer

of these have come since 1960,

The reason for the poor show-
ing this year appears to have
come from erratic scheduling of
games due to inclimate weather
and the break between the
winter and the spring terms.
Top performances in baseball
(unlike football or Lacrosse) oc-
cur when teams play every day.

The Generals didn’t have this
benefit because: (1) they had
ten games rained out in a four
week period and (2) were fore-
ed to play eight games in eight
days after a two week lay-off for
winter term exams.

These factors kept the team
from getting into any kind of
rythmn and caused erratic
showings in many of the games:

‘and we gained a little momen-
tum for our remaining games.”

The first quarter ended in a
2-2 tie with W&L goals by Geoff
Brent and Jay Foster. Though
the Generals were finding the
openings and took a lot of shots
on goal (21), they were just off
the mark and managed to score
only twice.

In the second quarter the
Generals zeroed in on the net
and produced one of their
patented scoring bursts, netting
six straight goals starting at the
14:51 mark.

The half ended with W&L in
the lead 8-4.

The most impressive score of
the third period came when
Jerry Broccoli, usually a defen-
sive and fast-break artist, went
in to score when the Generals
were a man down. Broccoli also
captured Player-of-the-Game
honors.

The third quarter ended with
the Generals in a commanding
14-6 lead.

The final period saw W&L
outscore Rutger’s Scarlet

Coach Chuck Kroll, in his see-
ond year as head coach of the
team, points out that one must
look beyond the team’s record
to see the improvements made.
‘First of all, the attitude of the
players was different from last
year. We were hungrier than
last year’s team but we didn't
inflict any of the pressure on
ourselves that I saw happening
last season. The players were
always working hard and they
never complained about some
of the tough breaks we had in
our schedule,”’ said Kroll.

The team statistics also point
out that the W&L team played
better baseball this year. Com-
pared to last year, the team had
a higher batting percentage,

 

Knights 3-1 with goals by Mike
Pressler, Chris Kearney and
Defensiveman John Sancilio to
put the final tally at 17-7.

Throughout the game the
Generals looked sharp in every
catagory. Their passes were
sharp and accurate and they
penetrated well inside, even the
outside shots found the mark.
They picked up ground balls
well and generally played good,
aggressive Lacrosse.

Twelve different Generals
scored as every member of the
team got into the action and the
crowd showed their apprecia-
tion by enthusiastic applause,

Geoff Brent continued his
scoring by netting two goals as
did George Santos, John
Hooper, John Kemp and Jay
Foster. Rob Staugitis and Mike
Pressler led the assist catagory
with three apiece.

Goalie Bob Clements played
another excellent game with 16
blocked shots and Ware
Palmer, taking over in the goal
in the second half, didn’t allow a
single shot to pass him by.

twice as many extra base hits,
less strikeouts and a_ higher
fielding percentage.

It was also a time for several
firsts this year. In a double-
header against Emory & Henry,
the Generals, for the first time
in four years, completed a
sweep of both games and
recorded their first shutout
(7-0) at the time.

This season was also the first

time W&L beat Randolph-
Macon in baseball.
In individual notes, Thad

Ellis led the team in hitting
(,393), Chris Cavalline in total
bases (44), Chip Childs in pit-
ching (2.50 era), and Jeff Hag-
gerty in fielding (.971 ave. )

The Generals, now 9-1 on the
season, showed that they can
play the caliber lacrosse that
they are capable of; even with
the draining two-game _ per
week schedule they have been
facing.

 

Generals 15
Baltimore 6

 

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals Lacrosse team travel-
ed to Baltimore University in
Baltimore, Md. last Wednesday
and walked away with a convin-
cing 15-6 win.

The Generals upped their
overall record to 8-1 and
brought a possible playoff bid
closer to home.

The first half of the game was
tight as the Baltimore Bees
played well on defense, not
allowing the inside pass. The
result was a University of
Baltimore lead of one goal, 4-3,
at the half.

Geoff Brent scored two of the
three Generals’ goals, with two
coming on extra man situa-
tions.

In the second half, the
Generals began to penetrate the
Bee’s defense.

After two W&L scores and one
by Baltimore to tie the game at
five, the Generals came up with
six consecutive goals in a little
over three minutes to put them
well in the lead, 11-5.

The Generals continued to
dominate play for the rest of the
game, virtually shutting down
Baltimore's offense and scoring
on 9 of 16 extra man plays. W&L
scored once more in the third
period and three times in the
fourth to lock up the 15-6 vic-
tory.

W&L Baseball Only Season Away

According to Kroll, ‘leaving
the team will be five seniors
who have done a tremendous
job. They led the team in so
many different ways and will be

missed next season.’’ Grad-
uating will be pitchers By
Steele, Vic Sheppard, and

Childs. Along with them will be
infielder John Stagmier and
outfielder Don Swagart.

The outlook for next year is
optimistic. The Generals will
have onr junior, seven sopho-
mores, and six freshmen retur-
ning. Kroll feels that if the team
can work on improving upon the
pitching they will be ‘‘one step
away from. having, a great
season.”

On April 28-29, the
Washington and Lee varsity
tennis team didn’t just win its
fourth ODAC team title in as
many years; the netmen vir-
tually walked away with the en-
tire tournament. Before that
Tuesday afternoon was over,
four Generals had taken first
place in their singles flights,
while two others took second. In
doubles, it was a virtual W&L
sweep, with Generals capturing
the crown at the first and se-
cond flights, while posting a
secondplace finish at third.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson ended his senior year

Commentary:

 

as he began it, as the ODAC’s
first singles champion. Jackson
eliminated Scott Goodman of
Hampden-Sydney in the finals,
7-6, 6-2.

Peter Lovell, a junior who
was moved up to second singles
for the tournament, rose to the
occasion as he routed Lynch-
burg’s Kevin Record, 6-2, 6-1, to
claim the second singles crown.
David Constine, senior co-
captain and last year’s fourth
singles champion, moved up to
third singles but remained a
champion as he crushed Bo
Hoart of Roanoke, 6-1, 6-2.

Two Sports Are
Treated Poorly

by Bill Whalen

Washington and Lee is a
school which prides itself in its
philosophy of not recruiting
athletes or trying to compete
with the big-time public schools
in most intercollegiate sports.
Yet beneath this philosophy lies
a schizophrenia of how certain
sports are treated.

Take the sports of baseball
and tennis, for example.

The baseball team has long
been mired in the depths of los-
ing seasons. Yet in the past few
seasons, the team has shown
marked improvement, But
despite the team’s improve-
ment, the university has seem-
ed anything but enthusiastic
over the prospects of a winning
baseball program.

This is why the team is coach-
ed by a man who was brought to
the school originally as a foot-
ball coach.

Before I go any further, I do
not at all mean to slander Chuck
Kroll. He seems to have a gen-
uine enthusiasm for the
Washington and Lee baseball

 

  

program and he is trying his
hardest to make the program
into a winner.

Who I really find at fault is
the administration. While Kroll
is giving the baseball team his
best shot and the program is on
the rise, the fact still remains
that the University is treating
the sport as a second class
citizen by dishing it off on a
coach who would probably pre-
fer to spend his time coaching
football.

Kroll is doing a good job with
the program, but he probably
would be willing to step down in
favor of another man who has
more experience in coaching
collegiate baseball.

The same can be said about
Washington and Lee’s tennis
program. The school currently
has given the job to Gary
Franke, who originally came to
this school to coach wrestling.

Very few people realize it, but
the varsity tennis team has
been a _ consistent winner
against other teams both in
Division I play and the NCAA

singles during the season, mov-
ed to the fourth spot for the tour-
nament and it payed off; Shar-
man came from behind to
demolish Jim Cain of Hampden-
Sydney, 5-7, 6-1, 6-0.

Both freshman Steve Denny
and sophomore Wes Younge,
after winning their first two
matches, succumbed in the
finals finishing second overall.
Denny, playing at the fifth
flight, lost a tough 2-6, 6-3, 6-2
match to Lou Dibos_ of
Hampden-Sydney, while
Younge, at sixth, fell to Jeff
Armbruster of Hampden-
Sydney, 7-5, 6-4.

The Ring-tum Phi, May 8, 1980, Page 21

Netmen Control ODAC Tourney (Again)

Jackson and Lovell later add-
ed a first place finish at the top
flight doubles position, cruising
past Hampden-Sydney’s team,
6-4, 6-1. Constine and Denny
followed closely behind at the
second position, taking the title
in a 6-3, 6-0 rout over their
Hampden-Sydney opponent.
But it was H-S’ third doubles
team that prevailed over the
duo of W&L’s senior Pat Norris
and Wes Younge, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 in
the finals, giving W&L the third
of its three second place
finishes.

In addition to winning their
fourth ODAC title in a row, the

 

Division II] Tournament. Only
the lacrosse team can boast of
as many appearances in post-
season play.

Yet once again, the school has
treated the tennis program like
a second-class citizen. Does the
school really believe that a ten-
nis team can prosper without
the advice of a seasoned tennis
coach? So far, the tennis team
has gotten as far as it has ona
lot of pure talent.

Seniors:

Pick up your reprints
before May 15th or you
will not receive a copy
of the yearbook.
Someone will be in

the Calyx office every

morning.

Once again, I do not mean to
take an unnecessary swipe at
Gary Franke. He seems to en-
joy coaching tennis and the
players like him. But like any
other coach in his situation, his
first love is wrestling.

Of course the University will
make the argument that it can-
not bring along any more
coaches because there is not
any room on the school’s staff.
This is due to the fact that so
many athletic ‘‘professors’’

Generals will keep another
tradition going by sending a
strong team to the NCAA III
Championships at Claremont-
Mudd College in Claremont,
California. The tournament will
be held May 14-17, and this year
marks the fourth time in a row
that the W&L netmen have
gone.

This year’s team will include
Jackson, Lovell, Constine, and
Sharman at the singles spots.
Jackson and Lovell will again
team up as the first doubles
team, while Gaker and Norris
will man the second doubles

position.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Mock Convention
Spirits

For at least two days this weekend the Washington

and Lee community will be immersed in another
world.

Attention will be focused on little Lexington,
Virginia, to see the results of the 1980 Republican
Mock Convention.

Much of this attention will come from the media
and it should be focused on the proceeding of the ac-
tual convention, not the behavior of the students of
Washington and Lee.

Lest the writer be criticized for acting like an old
maid, of for being more paranoid that a father sen-
ding his daughter out on her first date, which happens
to be at a fraternity party, let some examples of W&L
students’ behavior in years past be recalled.

_ In 1960 Harry Truman was pelted with various ob-
jects, from oranges to beer cans, while people
chanted ‘‘Give’em hell Harry.”’

Though John F. Kennedy was nominated that year,
the conduct of W&L students nearly received as much
press as the actual outcome of the convention.

And not too long ago an overzealous W&L lacrosse
fan saw fit to dump a drink on the Navy lacrosse
coach's wife.

Even more recently a large crowd listening to a
band in the old gym during a big weekend was stunn-
ed when one W&L student smashed a bottle over
another's face.

We hope that no such unfortunate incidents will oc-
cur this weekend, the Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee has put alot of time and thought into planning
the latest edition of the Convention.

So remember, no matter how much you celebrate
this weekend, have a good time but don’t do

something you will regret when you see it on the even-
ing news.

it was to comment on a more

Dear Editor:

Recently we had the great
pleasure of joining the
Washington and Lee Glee Club

Under the superior direction
of Dr. Gordon Spice, accom-

talented, well-mannered and
cultured young gentlemen
represented the United States
and Washington and Lee in the
most diplomatic and traditional
manner.

Dear Editor:

When I saw the picture of the rain-soaked crowd
at the Washington anti-nuke rally two weeks ago,
and then read the article which duly anathematiz-
ed it as a band of left-wing crackpots, I shook my
head and said ‘‘Why bother?’’ The media has done
such an effective job of associating the anti-
nuclear movement with personalities and causes

which are alienating to middle America that it vir- > e

tually ensures that legitimate discussions of the
subject fall on deaf ears. More nukes, less kooks,
hah-hah, hand me another beer. Why bother in-
deed?

Characteristic responses of W&L students to
nuclear power issues also fall into patterns which
indicate that opinions may be based more on
parents’ revulsion for Jane Fonda than personal
assessment of benefit vs. risk. However, it is
possible after a time to see past knee-jerk
responses into the heart of the anti-nuclear posi-
tion, and discover that the position usually rests on
one or more of three fundamental beliefs, all of
them wrong.

(1) What you can’t see won’t hurt you. If drunk
and backed into a corner, most W&L students will
angrily respond with their gut-level feeling that
people are not dropping like flies around nuclear
power plants and what the hell is all the brouhaha
about, anyway. This is an understandable carry-
over from our primate past, where unseen
dangers lay mostly in the spiritual realm. But this
is the modern age — radiation, slowly and
cumulatively, kills. A _ full-fledged reactor
economy (about 200 reactors, or three times the
number we have now) will under normal operat-
ing conditions leak enough radiation to cause
200,000 cancers a year in twenty years unless it is
99.999 percent efficient in containment. (See Dr.
John Gofman, Irreverent Illustrated View of
Nuclear Power). This is a degree of perfection
never attained in any industry (airlines are good,
but nowhere that good); when you use machines,
things go wrong. The near disasters at Fermi in
1966, Brown's Ferry in 1975, and Three Mile Island
in 1979 prove this beyond contention.

We are, sadly, out of the primitive age and into a
new one where statistics accumulate and inter-
twine to paint a more accurate picture of reality
than our own senses. We need a banker’s eye for
the ultimate results of small effects, added
together over time. If we do not have it, we will
certainly one day smack into a radiation growth
curve, as real and substantial as compound in-
terest; but the profits we take will be counted in
grief.

(2) We need nuclear power to decrease our
dependence on foreign oil, and eliminate that as a
possible cause for war. The student saying this is
likely to betray a feeling that, hmm, deep down in-
side, going to war over oil (or anything else) might
not be such a bad idea at all. In fact, only about 10
percent of our oil is used for generating electrici-
ty. Nuclear power is used exclusively for generat-
ing electricity. If we convert entirely to nuclear,
we will still be consuming petroleum at 90 percent
of our present rate (Harvard Business School,
Energy Futures), assuming consumption for
other uses does not rise. How will this eliminate
our need for foreign oil? Moreover, and this is an
important moreover, uranium is a_ scarce
mineral, of which this country has only a 10-15
year supply remaining. Uranium prices have
already risen 600 percent in 6 years — what hap-
pens when we run out? Almost certainly we will
find ourselves dealing with a usurous UPEC, cut-
ting their heartless pound of flesh with as much
gusto as the Arab nations do today. Future
scenarios could include war with Australia over
its uranium — a tragedy, since they make such
fine beer.

The real untapped energy source in this country
is efficient technology. About half of all energy
consumed is simply wasted, leaked through unin-
sul ‘ted ceilings and blown out through smoke-
stacks. These flaws in design can be corrected,
will be corrected, if the market is permitted to res-

 

pond to new, more realistic perceptions of the
availability of energy resources. When oil prices
go up, engineers and architects will find ways to
save oil, something they have not done in the past
largely because they have not had to.

It is not gigantic central mega-planning, Soviet
Union style, which will get us through the energy
crisis; the result of such planning everywhere is
waste and failure based on wishful thinking. It is
many, many enterprising individuals, always this
country’s strength, acting on true data free from
government meddling, which will point us in the
direction of national survival like a compass nee-
dle toward the pole.

(3) In the long run, we will do whatever is
cheapest. This is a shark’s-eye view of the reality
of economic process, elicited from the cynical in
dark, smoky rooms. It is absolutely correct. It is
therefore imperative to realize that nuclear power
is anything but-cheap; its costs do not appear only
in utility bills, but are also buried deep in the
federal budget. Nuclear and coal generated elec-
tricity are now about equally costly, if one con-
siders only utility rates; but including fuel enrich-
ment, reprocessing, waste storage and other sub-
sidies, consuming $2 billion worth of tax dollars in
1980, we see that nuclear power is vastly more ex-
pensive than coal.

A greater expense than direct subsidy is the
psychological price we pay in exempting the in-
dustry from responsibility for its acts. The $560
million dollar limit on liability set by the Price-
Anderson Act amounts to little more than a license
to kill. Congress, prompted by nuclear True
Believers, has committed its grossest insults to
the Bill of Rights in the name of nuclear power. It
is as if Congress has forced us to hire a bad-
tempered giant with a stick, at our own expense,
to work for us, but if the giant were to cut loose and
beat the hell out of somebody with the stick, well,
too bad — it’s our fault for hiring him! !

Now is it a surprise that fledgling attempts at
alternative solutions to the energy problem have
trouble competing with the massively subsidized
nuclear energy? What private entrepreneur can
risk the $20 billion in research and development
capital spent by the government in 30 years of
nuke-mongering? Geothermal, photovoltaic,
wind, ocean thermal and several other tender
young flowers of human genius are being expected
to compete with an overgrown, poisonous weed. If
you want to reckon the cost, add this one to the
nuclear side of the ledger: our other possible
futures.

Returning to that crowd of cold, wet idealists
and their desperate dreams, I asked m¥self again,
why bother? And I must answer, because they are
right. Their solutions are not my solutions, but
their analysis of the problem is dead on target, I
perceive them, and their freakish vision, as an ad-
vance receptor for the human race nervous
system, like a woman’s intuition or a bird’s
awareness of danger. They sense the ongoing rape
of the earth and the fallacy that one can take
forever, without ever giving back. To them and to
me, cooling stacks are an impetuous and terrible
symbol: Man’s Dominion at last, over a dead
planet.

As someone said, it may come down blue or it
may come down green, but all of it is going to
come down heavy. Count on it.
