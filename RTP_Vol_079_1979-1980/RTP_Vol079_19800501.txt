musical entertainment for their
official Spring Weekend beginn-
ing this Friday, May 2nd.

That evening at Zollman’s
Pavillion the juniors are spon-
soring their class party which

 

begins at 8:00 p.m. At 9:00 the

jazz band Child’s Play will ap-

will be followed at midnight by
Street Talk, the popular
Southern rock band, who is
scheduled to play until 2:00 a.m.
Refreshments for the party re-

dicate a choice between popular

grain and perennial beer hinges
on an increase in ticket sales.
Tickets may be purchased,
$3.00 single and $5.00 for
couples, and class passes will
be honored.

Law Student Charged By
Hospital For No Treatment

by Randy Smith

Bill Calore, a first-year law
student at Washington and Lee,
injured his head during
February’s mid-winter
undergraduate break.

He went to Stonewall Jackson
Hospital in town because he
assumed W&L’s _infirmery
would be closed, since it keeps
such short hours when the
undergraduates are out of
school.

Once at the hospital, he was
told that the infirmery was open
and he should go there for treat-
ment.

Now, over two months later,
Calore is in dispute with the
hospital over a $15 bill for not
receiving treatment.

The law student related his
story to the student body Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night and asked the govern-
mental body to look into it.

Although Calore had left a
note in the complaint box out-
side the infirmery shortly after
the accident, he has received no
response from the University

Health Committee established
by the EC several months ago.

“We're being ignored one
more time around,” said EC
law school representative John
Fraser. ‘Bill got shafted. This
committee (the health commit-
tee) should get behind him.”

Bob Willis, junior EC rep. and
next year’s student body presi-
dent, called for a meeting of the
health committee to take place
sometime this week, with a
report to be delivered to the EC
this Monday.

Willis also wants an explana-
tion from administration offi-
cials about the practice of cut-
ting off 24-hour on campus
medical service when
undergraduates are on break.

The EC has spent $1,951.49 so
far this year, Les Cotter, EC
vice-president, reported.

Over $400 was spent on kegs
of beer for freshman orientation
last fall.

Printing expenses have totall-
ed $298 and the telephone com-
pany has been paid $190 this
year.

The EC has $1,548.51 remain-
ing in its “Office Expense ac-
count”’ from an original $3,500.

In the ‘‘Student Body Reserve
Fund Account,’ the EC has
$9,607.28 left to distribute. This
amount is almost $200 more
than the committee had
originally.

The committee also approved
‘money for three kegs”’ of beer
for a “meeting of campus
leaders’ on May 16. The
‘“meeting’”’ was proposed by
Bob Willis, junior EC rep.

The purpose of the gathering
is so that present and future
campus leaders can meet and
discuss problems in an informal
setting.

But all are invited.

The ‘‘meeting’’ is scheduled
to be held in the Alumni house
on- May 16, from 4-6 p.m.

Professor Profile Series

Dr. Griffith To Retire

 

By Jim Feinman

Dr. E.C. Griffith, Professor of Economics, will
retire from teaching at the end of the academic
year. Griffith, 65, will continue his work with the
Federal Mediation and Arbitration Service while
spending more time with his family as well as in
his garden and wood-working shop. 7

Claybrook Giffith came to the University in 1946
after six years at the University of Georgia. He
has served as Chairman of the Department of
Economics since 1955.

In the same third-floor office he has occupied in
Newcomb Hall for the past 34 years, Professor

greatest attributes of the University is its em-
phasis on classroom performance, for both faculty
and students. The main object ve is teaching — we
emphasize research and allow ample opportunity
for it — but the University allows people who’s in-
terest is in teaching, to teach. Here teachers are

 

Griffith related to the Alumni Magazine his feel- -

able to use their research to supplement their
teaching, unlike other schools where the emphasis
is on research, and teaching is merely a means of
support while research is underway.”

“During my years here, the University has
maintained and assembled a faculty of great com-
petence, and there has been considerable im-
provement in the physical plant such as library
facilities and laboratory space. On the other hand,
I have seen some changes in the University that
have bothered me considerably, In terms of
students for example, I have been troubled over
the years by the collapse of traditions that I think
were an outstanding part of the University when I
came here.”’

One disappearing tradition that disturbs Pro-
fessor Griffith is the ‘‘speaking”’ tradition. ‘‘It us-

professor without some friendly recognition, such
as a hello, a wave of the hand or a nod of the head.
Now, speaking is more honored in the breech,

sities.

The Gilliam Award is given
annually to the student ‘‘who
has made the most valuable
contribution to student affairs
in one or more fields.’’ The
award is one of the university's
most prestigous because the

   

recipient is chosen by a com-
mittee of student
underclassmen.

The award is named for Dean
Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam as a
tribute to his long and devoted
service to Washington and Lee.
It consists of a silver bowl and a
cash donation to the university
organization or department
selected by the recipient.

‘‘T feel it is a great honor,”
Cornett said after receiving the
award. ‘I was really surprised
and honored.”

The $100 cash award will be
donated to the Mock Convention
committee, Cornett said.

The award presentation was
made by University President
Robert E.R. Huntley.

In Memorium

David A. Madison, Jr.

David A. Madison Jr., a 23-
year employee of Washington
and Lee University and for
many years the head of the
campus mail service, died Fri-
day morning in a Lexington
hospital. He was 60.

He is survived by his wife,
Mrs. Mary Madison of Lex-
ington; two sons, David A.
Madison III and Michael
Madison, both of Dale City, Va.;
his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth
Madison of Lexington; a sister,

Mrs. Elizabeth Butler of
Bridgeport, Conn., and six
grandchildren.

Washington and Lee’s presi-
dent, Robert E.R. Huntley,

said: ‘‘Dave Madison was a
part of the actual fabric of
Washington and Lee — easygo-
ing and hardworking, as good a
yarn-spinner, as good-natured,
with as good a sense of humor,
and as devoted to W&L as
anyone I’ve known. For many
of us, certainly for me, he was a
sounding-board and advisor as
well as good friend. Not much
ever managed to happen at
W&L that Dave didn’t know

about and approve of.”’
A funeral service took place
Monday in First Baptist

Church. Interment followed in
Evergreen Cemetery. J.B.
Lewis Funeral Service was in
charge of arrangements.

UC Petitions Received

Fifteen petitions were receiv-
ed Monday for positions on the
University Council.

problems. )

The following five students
are running for senior positions
on the UC: Jamie Small, Robert
Neely, Chris Gammon, Ray-
mond Best and Joe Robles.

To Speak
Tonight

James David Barber, pro-
fessor of political science at
Duke University and author of
the soon-to-be-published book:
“The Pulse of Politics: The
Rhythm of Presidential Politics
in the 20th Century,” will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Thursday, May 1, on his
view of the role of the mass
media as the decisive influence
in today’s presidential elec-
tions.

Scheduled for 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel, Barber’s address is
open to the public at no charge.

Barber’s often startling grasp
of the American political scene
began to surface prominently in
1969 — then, in a paper on
Richard Nixon, he predicted the
to come in_ that
presidency. Three years later,
he challenged many long-held
standards of political assess-
ment in his book ‘‘The Presiden-
tial Character.”’

A native of Charleston,
W.Va., Barber attended the
public schools in the area before
moving to the University of
Chicago, where he received
both his B.A. and master’s
degrees. He received his Ph.D.
in political science from Yale in
1960.

From 1960 to 1972, he held a
variety of positions in Yale’s
political science division — as
professor, director of graduate
studies in politics, and associate
director of the department's
research library. In 1972 he
moved to Duke, where for the
past eight years he has been

department head and James B.
Duke Professor of Political
Science.
 

Book Review

Tom Wolfe, noted journalist
and author of the recent best-
selling The Right Stuff, will
speak in Lee Chapel on Wednes-
day, May 7 at 3:00 p.m. as part
of the Contact ’80 program.

Recognized as a master of the
non-fiction novel and_ short-
story, Wolfe is a_ self-
proclaimed proponent of the
‘‘New Journalism’’ which
blends hard-reporting and fic-
tion narrative techniques. As a
documentor of pop culture in
the ’60’s and early ’70’s, he rose
to popularity with such books as
The Kandy-Kolored Tangarine,
Flake Streamline Baby (1965)
and Ratical Chic and Man-
Maning, The Flak-Catchers
(1970). The Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test (1968), perhaps his
best known work reported on
the acid culture and Ken
Kesey’s psychadelic, freaked
out Merry Pranksters.

A native of Richmond,
Virginia, Wolfe graduated from
Washington and Lee University
(cum laude) with a B.A. in
English. While an
undergraduate, he was sports

The Right Stuff

by Channing Hall

Tom Wolfe’s recent book, The Right Stuff, is a
history of the early space program from the dar-
ing antics of the fighter test-pilots to the selection
of the first astronauts and the early Mercury
flights. The book is as smooth as his sartorial
vanilla: the free-wheeling prose reveals the essen-
tial, vibrating dazzle of Wolfe.

Wolfe supplies electricity to the work by blend-
ing the best of the novel and the analytical scholar-
ly essay with the facts of hard reporting. The
result is delightful reading.

The author gives the reader not mere descrip-
tion, but an ability to get inside, under the skin of a
‘phenomenon, and transmit its pulse.

Wolfe is fascinated by subcultures—whether
they be the acid culture of Ken Kesey, the radical
chic of Leonard Bernstein, or the elite fraternity of
hotshot Navy pilots who volunteered for the space
program.

The author attempts to find out what makes
them tick; what drives a test pilot to put his hide
on the line (almost joyfully) everyday, while
pushing a machine to its limits, or perched in a
Mercury capsule on top of a rocket.

To explain this, Wolfe formulates the theory of
“the right stuff’ — the unspoken cannon of non-
chalant cool, nerve, and ineffability that went
beyond mere bravery in the face of death.
Everyone knew what the right stuff was and who
had it, but no one actually talked about it. By prov-
ing his “‘right’’ness, one could join the elite group
and progress up the steps of the pyramid ‘“‘to join
that special few at the very top, that elite who had
the capacity to bring tears to men’s eyes, the very
Brotherhood of the Right Stuff itself.”

These were the best, the Chuck Yeagers and the
Deke Sleytons. But one could fall from the
pyramid at any step: indecision could precipitate
one’s death, and this made life at the top
dangerous. Wolfe reminds one of this fact con-

stantly by the reappearing image of testpilots’

wives awaiting news of their husbands’ deaths.
When Scott Carpenter returned from orbit early,
heedless of his fuel supply, the consensus was that
he had panicked and lost his “‘stuff.”’

Wolfe’s undertone in The Right Stuff hints that
the astronauts, especially John Glenn, became
heroes because of driving ego and personal ambi-
tion. America need heroes at that point of the Cold
War — astronauts were our last combat heros
dueling with the Russians for mastery of the
heavens. Even the press, which Wolfe describes as
‘‘an anachronistic colonial animal, a Victorian
Gent,’’ accomodated these new heroes by
overlooking their personal lives to portray them
as flying saints.

What distinguishes this book, however, is not its
subject matter, but the wild rush of Wolfe's witty
prose. It is pure fun for the reader. The barrage of
hyped vocabulary, run-on sentences, and wild
punctuation in his exclamatory journalism traps
the stream of consciousness as he imagines it in
his subjects: The reader can actually feel the
“right stuff.”’

Wolfe’s new-fangled, pop, op, ellipsed, wild-
wowie-metaphorical, over-italicized, super-
capitalized, em-dashed, vinyl-lined, gadzooks,
overlain prose is almost as outrageous as his
clothing. He grabs the reader by his lapels and
thumps the heart.

Wolfe seems to find the proper voice to describe
the brothers of the cockpit: technical jargon,
testpilot drawl, and whizbang hyperbole mixed
with a touch of nostalgia.

The Right Stuff is Tom Wolfe at his best. It
demonstrates that besides being the most spec-
tacular journalist in years, he is the master of the
non-fiction novel. In the words of Karl Shapiro:
“Tom Wolfe is more than brillant...He is more
than urbane, suave, trenchant...Tom Wolfe is a
goddam joy...Also, not to insult him, he writes like
a master.”’

pus, president Robert E.R.
Huntley presented Capt. Scott
C. Long of the school’s military
science department with the Ar-
my Commendation Medal —
Capt. Long’s third such decora-
tion for distinguished achieve-
ment.

The award was given to
recognize Long’s role in
expanding and improving the
Washington and Lee Reserve
Officer Training Corps _pro-
gram, which has nearly doubled
in enrollment during his tenure
there.

Participating in the
ceremony was Lt. Col. Thomas
B. Vaughn, professor of
military science at W&L, who
described Long as ‘the prime
architect in improving W&L’s
ROTC program.”

Long, a native of Richmond,

Film Notes

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) Frank Capra’s highly-
acclaimed political comedy/drama, with heavy doses of morality
and patriotic sentiment, made James Stewart a superstar and
earned him his first Academy Award nomination (he won the next
year for The Philadelphia Story, many believe, on the merits of the
former. This is a well-made, well-written film, often nostalgic when
seen today with young Jimmy as the wide-eyed junior senator from
Wisconsin gawking at the marble splendor of Washington and then
taking political corruption head-on. Jean Arthur, a fine actress and
comedienne, co-starred in this Columbia ‘‘A’”’ picture with an
amazing supporting cast which includes Claude Rains, Thomas
Mitchell, Guy Kibbee, Eugene Pallette, Edward Arnold, William
Demerest, Beulah Bondi, and radio announcer H. V. Kaltenborn.

The Candidate (1972) Robert Redford stars as an attractive but
unwise senatorial candidate in a role that won him scattered
praise, but which stands a disappointing distance from the rash of
Redford successes in this fruitful period of his career. With Melvyn
Douglas, as one of the seemingly countless elder statesmen he has
played in his latter-day period of character parts. To be shown at
the conclusion of Mr. Smith, which begins at 7:00 p.m., Friday
through Sunday, in Dupont Auditorium. Admission for each show-
ing will be $1.

Picnic at Hanging Rock (1977) A brilliant success by the
Australian director Peter Weir, a discussion of which appears in
this issue of the The Ring-tum Phi. Presented by the Film Society in
Lewis Hall, May 2 and 3, at 8:00 p.m. No admission is charged.

‘Picnic At Hanging Rock’

By Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Picnic at
Hanging Rock’ (Australia,
1975), directed by Peter Weir.
Weir’s movies Picnic at Hang-
ing Rock and The Last Wave
are among a number of films
from the newly emergent
Australian cinema which are
currently exciting attention and
praise in this country. Picnic
will be screened Friday and
Saturday, May 2 and 3, at 8 p.m.
in classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall.
Admission is free, and everyone
is cordially invited to attend.

Picnic at Hanging Rock has
been compared to Antonioni’s
L’Avventura (1960) in that it too
is based on a true story of a
disappearance which, like that
of the girl who vanishes from
the volcanic island in Antoni-
oni’s film, remains unsolved
and disquieting.

Picnic concerns’ the
mysterious disappearance of
several girls on their Valen-
tine’s Day picnic from Apple-
yard College in 1900. They ‘‘as-
cend’’ Hanging Rock, a geolog-
ical formation in Australia, in
an act that has both meta-
physical and sexual suggestive-
ness. One girl is later found
alive, but she has no recollec-
tion of what has become of the
others, and they are never
found.

Both Antonioni and Weir take
the mystery as an occasion for a
meditation on the emotional
and sexual nature of the sur-
rounding society. For Antoni-
oni, that sexuality, flawed by
twentieth century ennui, is arid
and futile. Weir, however, uses
the repressiveness of Austra-
lian Victorianism to give the

Met. Opera

There is good news for opera
lovers who are mourning over
the end of the 1979-80
Metropolitan Opera broadcast
season. Beginning next Sunday,
May 4, at 6 p.m., and continuing
for six successive weeks at the
same time, performances from
the Lyric Opera of Chicago may
be heard on WLUR-FM,

This marks WLUR’s first
association with the Lyric
Opera network, which may
become a familiar yearly
follow-up to the 20-week Met
series.

Leading the list of produc-
tions will be Verdi’s poignant
‘Simon Boccanegra,” starring
Sherrill Milnes. Subsequent
weeks will bring Prokofiev’s
fantasy ‘‘The Love For Three
Oranges’ May 11; Gounod’s
‘‘Faust,”’ which was televised
on PBS last January, to be
presented May 18; a new pro-

mystery a sense of both of hor-
ror and lush sensuality. The
movie is especially noted for its
visual opulence, and its beau-
tifully composed and edited
scenes.

Our last movie of the 1979-1980
season will be Federico
Fellini's Roma (Italy, 1972),
scheduled for May 16 and 17.

Generals Survive Washington Threat;

Get Placed Behind Syracuse In Poll

By Robert Massie

Under threatening, overcast
skies, the Washington and Lee
Generals battled their way
Saturday to a 9-7 victory over a
young Washington College team
on the strength of a fourth
quarter rally that broke a 5-5
tie.

The victory boosted the
General's record to 7 wins and
one loss and maintained their
undefeated record at home.

Chris Kearney again led the
team with three goals and one
assist as well as capturing
Player of the Game honors. Rob
Staugitis came up with three
assists, boosting his season's
total to 27.

The game turned out to be
surprisingly even, with a fired-
up Washington College team

forcing the Generals at every
point.

The Generals again struck
early with Geoff Brent scoring
only 26 seconds into the game.
Half a minute later Roman
Kupecky stretched the lead to
2-0 on a pass from Rob
Staugitis.

But then Washington College
came back. Shoremen fresh-
man Paul Hooper (John
Hooper's brother) tossed one in
to-cut the lead to one.

Chris Kearney then scored his
first goal unassisted, but the
Shoremen returned the favor by
scoring twice more to tie the
score after one period, 3-3.

The second quarter was a
dead heat

W&L's Geoff Brent hit his sec-

ond goal on a pass from Rob

Lax Team Seeking Funds For Trip

The Washington & Lee
lacrosse team, in an effort to
support next season's winter
practice trip, will seed a $1
donation at the Generals’ home
game with Rutgers University
on Saturday, May 3. Game time
at Wilson Field is 2:00 p.m. with

donations to be collected at the
gates.

W&L head coach Jack Em-

Netmen Upset

By Dale Park

The W&L varsity tennis team
began turning up for the upcom-
ing ODAC tournament,
registering two victories in
their last three matches.

On April 22, W&L faced the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers. In a

preview of things to come in the’

ODAC tourney, the Generals
cruised to an easy 8-1 victory.
Winners included senior co-
captain Stewart Jackson at first
singles, junior Peter Lovell at
number three, senior co-captain
David Constine at the fourth
flight, junior Doug Gaker at
fifth and freshman Steve Denny
at sixth.

The Generals went on to
sweep the doubles positions,
with the usual combinations of
Jackson and Lovell at the first
spot and Constine and Denny at
the second flight. Yet the third
flight doubles saw a new face,
with sophomore Wes Younge
making his first varsity ap-
pearence of the year, Younge
teamed with senior Pat Norris
for an easy 6-1, 6-4 victory.

The following day, the
Generals faced Division I

Davidson College and came
away with one of their biggest
wins of the year. W&L all but
locked up the match in the
singles competition, taking four
of the six flights, but squeaked
to a 5-4 triumph by winning only
one of the three doubles posi-
tions.

Jackson continued to play
superb tennis for the Generals,
bouncing back after losing the
first set 2-6, to take the remain-
ing two sets by the identical

day break toward the end of
February. Two years ago the
Generals travelled to Florida
for a week of practice; this
season the team flew to Ber-
muda. The Bermuda journey
cost the team $5500, all of which
was raised by the players.

scores of 6-2, 6-2, Freshman
Jack Sharman got back on the
winning track, posting a 6-4, 6-7
(5-1 tie-breaker), 6-4 victory at
second singles, while Gaker and
Denny, at the fifth and sixth
spots, stayed on the winning
track. Gaker easily dominated
his man, 6-3, 6-2, while Denny
went the distance, winning 6-2,
4-6, 6-2.

All three doubles matches
were as close as they come.
W&L's first doubles team of

by Paul Hooper, his third.

After another goal by the
Shoremen, W&L middie John
Tunney tied the score 5-5 at the
half.

After a scoreless third period,
Kearney hit his second goal to
put W&L up by one. Kupecky
then threw in his second at the
9:27 mark to put the Generals in
a comfortable 7-5 lead.

But Washington College
wouldn't let it rest at that. Paul
Hooper came back to score an
amazing fourth goal to put the
Shoremen within one.

Then the Generals put the
game away by scoring two
more consecutive goals.

First George Santos took a
feed from Kearney and tossed it
in. Then Kearney bulled his way
inside to score his third.

- captured

A final score by Washington
College gave W&L the win 9-7.

The game pitted the Generals
against the best goalie they
have faced.

‘We outshot them 49 to 29, but
their goalie blocked most of
them,’’ commented Generals
head coach Jack Emmer. ‘‘This
is the first time we had to face a
red-hot goalie, and the mark of
a good team is when you win in
games like that.”

Standouts in the game were
Kearney, John Hooper, who
14 of 19 face-offs
despite an injured shoulder, and
Rob Staugitis, who had 3
assists.

The Generals’ next home
game is this Saturday at 2 p.m.
against Rutgers University on
Wilson Field.

 

 

Soccer Club Wins Tourney

The Washington & Lee spring
soccer club, composed primari-
ly of players from the Genrals’
varisty squad, captured first
place Saturday in the Bedford
Invitational Tournament.

W&L'’s club, directed by head

soccer coach Rolf Piranian,
defeated Dabney Lancaster
Community College 8-1 and the
Valley United Club 4-1 to take
the win. Bryan Williams paced
the Generals’ attack with seven
goals in the games.

 

Jackson and Lovell fell 7-6 (5-2
tie-breaker) in the third set,
while the third flight team of
Constine and Denny went down
7-5 in the third. Yet the
Generals’ second doubles com-
gination of Gaker and Norris,
after losing the closest possible
first set (6-7 (4-5 tie-breaker) ),
came roaring back to win the
next two sets 6-2, 6-3, and
secured W&L’s 5-4 victory.
Although the Generals lost 7-2
to powerful Division I UVa. on

Davidson, Lose To UVa.

Apr. 25, the day was highlighted
by Stewart Jackson's wins boty
in singles (winning 7-5, 6-1), and
in doubles (teaming with Lovell
for a narrow 5-7, 7-6 (5-4 tie-
breaker), 7-6 (5-3 tie-breaker )
win). Other highpoints included
Gaker taking his man to three
sets, and close losses by both
Lovell and Sharman at singles,
all good indications that the
Generals should continue their
dominance in the ODAC this
year.

 

Over 28 runners braved a
cold, rainy and _ otherwise
miserable morning to run in the
Blue Ridge Classic’ held last
Saturday in Lexington.

The ten kilometer (6.2 miles)
race, formerly known as the
Ring-tum Phi Road Race, was
held to raise funds for the
Muscular Dystrophy Founda-
tion. According to Gerald Dar-

rell, director of the race and
head of W&L's food services,
donations from local merchants
and registration fees totalled

over $500.

From this total, however, has
to be subtracted the cost for 100
t-shirts which were given to
runners and race workers. Dar-
rell said that the race should
end up netting over $270.

Dean Greer, a law student at
W&L, won the men’s race by
covering the course in a time of
33:30.68. Phil Bishop and Mike
Bartini finished second and
third in the men’s division.

In the women's race, Carol
Phemister was the winner.
Overall, the classic was divided
into several age-group races
and a one-mile ‘fun run.”’

Blue Ridge Classic Raises Over $270

Despite the inciement
weather, many of the runners
were not at all disappointed.
“This was one of the better
races I’ve run in’’ said Bishop.

Darrell was likewise pleased
with the race but frustrated
over the weather. ‘‘We have the
resources to run a race,”’ said
the director, ‘‘but we can’t
seem to pick the right
weekend.”

 

 

 

 
Generals’ Ellis Leading
Team, ODAC In Hitting

By Chris Sisto
The baseball Generals were a
victim of politics this year when
it came time to select times for
the ODAC championship tour-
nament.

Last year it only took four
wins to make the tournament
and the Generals fell two wins
short of the mark. This year the
minimum number of wins was
upped to six.

So with a 5-8 record in ODAC
play the team’s only game last
week against Lynchburg Col-
lege, unbeaten in league play,
was very important.

When it was all over Lynch-
burg proved to be too much of a
match winning 13-3. The
Generals managed to get 10 hits
but they just couldn’t hold down
their opponent’s powerful of-
fense.

There are several positive
notes on this year’s season.

The team’s batting average
continues to rise and is much
higher than last year’s mark.
They have played seven less
games than last year at this
time, but already have eleven
more extra base hits.

   

The
ODAC.

On a personal note,
sophomore team captain, Thad
Ellis, the best batting average
in the ODAC with a mark of
.412. Freshman Chris Cavalline
is eighth in the league with a
.345 average.

So with a 509 record the

nerals’ Thad Ellis, holder of the best batting avera

 

    

ge in the

Generals have a chance at a
.500 seaso:.

They have four games tert on
the schedule and will play two
games against Newport News

header Saturday against, a
Division I, VMI.

Track Is Third
In ODAC Meet

THe Washington & Lee track
team finished third in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Championships held last Satur-
day and Sunday at Roanoke Col-
lege.

The Generals finished behind
league leaders Bridgewater
College and Eastern Mennonite
College with a total of 47 points.

Leading the Generals were
three individual champions.
Senior and tri-captain Rich Bird
won the one-mile race, junior R.
J. Scaggs won his 400-meter
race and sophomore Mike
Fogarty won the javelin throw.

Over Spring Break, the

Generals finished second in a
four-way meet also held at
Roanoke. Once again, the top
individual performers for the
Generals were Scaggs, Fogarty
and Bird.

W&L, which finished second
behind Lynchburg by a total ot
84 points to 68.5 points.

Other strong finishers for the
track team this season include
W&L’s one-mile and 440-yard
relay teams. The Generals have
posted a time of 3:31.6 in the
mile relay (second best in the
conference) and have run the
440 relay in a time of 44.1
seconds (also second best in the
conference).

Golf Team Ups
Record To 11-1

A first-place finish in a five-
way meet with Lynchburg,
Randolph-Macon, Ha _ den-
Sydney, Longwood and Ferrum
improved the Washington & Lee
golf team’s record to 11-1.

The Generals were led by
sophomore Jim Kaplan, who
posted a low score of 69.
Overall, the Generals shot an
18-hole total of 369, seven
strokes ahead of second place
finisher Lynchburg.

Currently, Bill Alfano has the
lowest average on the team,
shooting an average of 77.7 per
round. Kaplan has the next
lowest average at 78.4. Senior
and captain Gerry Barousse is
posting an average of 80 per 18
holes.

Barousse’s lowest total so far
has been a 74, while his highest
score is a 90). Both kaplan and
Barousse have the lowest
scores this year for one round.

Despite Confusion, Generals Should Be In The Tournament

By Bill Whalen

You can feel it in the air
around the campus. All the talk
about the lacrosse team has
switched from not whether it
will make the playoffs but to
whom it will play in the first
round. Such talk makes sense,
but the campus should not be
lulled into a sense of security
until the final bids have gone
out.

The reason for not trying to
guess the Generals’ opponent in
the tournament quarterfinals:
it is too early to make any type
of educated guess as to where
the Generals will be seeded and
how the other seven teams will
be placed.

I may eventually hate myself
for saying this, but the Generals
will qualify for this year’s tour-
nament. That is, if some type of
disaster does not occur in the
next three weeks. The reason
why I am going out on a limb:
look at the remaining schedule.

irst, you start with Rutgers,
ranked 13th in the nation this
week. The combination of the
Generals being a better team
and the game being played in
Lexington (or B.V. if you want a
guaranteed win) should get
W&L through this one.

The following Wednesday, the
Generals travel to Roanoke to
face the Maroons. When it plays
W4&L in lacrosse, Roanoke is the

proverbial pea in the show. But
once again, it is not the caliber
of the Generals. Besides, the
Maroons are in the midst of an
off year in which they will pro-
bably not qualify for a post-
season playoff spot.

Which brings us to North
Carolina. The Tar Heels are the
only team to beat Virginia, but
are not that same team. Since
the 14-5 cakewalk, the Heels
have lost to Maryland, UMBC
(the nation’s top Division II
team) and N.C. State. The com-
bination of last year’s loss to
U.N.C. and playing in Lex
should give W&L the edge.

Finally, we come to Hofstra.
The Dutchmen are another of

those spoiler teams but are not,
on paper, the same caliber of
team as W&L. This is a key
game, however, because it
would (A) be a victory on the
road and (B) a win over a jinx
team. A victory over Hofstra
would be the ideal way to gain
playoff momentum.

When compared to the rest of
the top-ranked teams, W&L is in
a rather secure position. In the
current top five, Virginia
finishes out this Saturday in a
non-game at Virginia Tech,
Johns Hopkins travels to Navy
on Saturday, Syracuse has to
play Massachusetts, and Navy
has to play Hopkins and then,

be certain, Virginia will be the

Under the ‘Hoos will be seven

IFC President Briscoe
Sees Upswing For Future

by Richard Moss

Monte Briscoe, newly-elected
president of next year’s IFC,
says that he forsees ‘‘positive
signs and better trends”’ for the
IFC next year, although he also
says that he doesn’t forsee any
major changes over this year’s
IFC.

Briscoe, a junior majoring in
politics and a member of the
PiKA social fraternity, said
that while ‘‘I thought there were
some good ideas’ in Jim
Fineman’s’ proposed’ IFC
charter published in the Mar. 6
issues of the Phi that, ‘I don’t
think the problems with the IFC
are the result of a poor constitu-
tion.”’

Briscoe said recently that he
feels the most important thing
for the IFC next year will be to

W&L Debate Team Squares Off Against Russians

The American reaction to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
forces ‘‘a pretext of a Soviet
military threat,’ said Alexis
Kruglov, a Russian graduate
student said last Thursday
night in Lee Chapel.

Kruglov was here as part of a
debate series in the United
States. His presentation stress-
ed the peaceful spirit of the
Soviet people. “*The Soviet peo-
ple want to live in peace,” he
said,

But the debate was not a
discussion of current affairs.
Both sides focused on the role of
the individual to the state.
However, the questioning
period following presentations
by both sides centered primari-

The News

Playboy magazine has caus-
ed quite a stir at Baylor Univer-
sity in Waco, Tex.

The magazine is doing
another of their photo sections,
this one is called ‘‘Girls of the
Southwest Conference.”’

But the president of the Bap-
tist college, Abner McCall, de-
nounced the magazine as ‘‘a
representation of Northern
sleaze,’’ and warned Baylor
women not to pose in the buff.
Expulsion was hinted as a
possibility for those who do.

The editors of the campus
newspaper, The Lariat, criticiz-
ed the university president in an
editorial, prompting him to
order that all future editorials
would have to be cleared

through his office before they

appeared in print.
Editor-in-chief Jeff Barton

responded to McCall in an

mood,

Visions of this weekend's festivities. We thought we'd get you in the

In Brief
uncleared editorial protesting
the new guidelines.

The university’s publications
board, acting on the president’s
recommendation, fired Barton,
the city editor, and the news
editor.

‘Historically and_ legally
freedom of the press has always
been the freedom of the
publisher,’’ McCall said. ‘‘This
constitutional freedom does not
belong to the editors or
reporters employed by the
publisher.”

Since that time the following
has happened: One professor
has resigned in protest of the
way the university handled the
affair; Barton was offered a job
at the local daily newspaper;
and Playboy is going ahead
with the project. (The magazine
has also offered free legal aid to
any students who pose. )

“take a strong stand on the
issues, instead of compromising
all the time.”’

Briscoe noted however, that
he did not intend for this state-
ment to reflect upon any
previous IFC administrations,
and went on to say, ‘Certainly
some compromises need to be
made, but we should have the
weight and influence to further
our goals.”’

In keeping with this, Briscoe
said that he ‘‘will be strict with
fines and infractions,’’ and that
he will ask the IFC judicial
board to do the same. “The IFC
laws should be followed by all,
not just some,” Briscoe added.

One of his biggest duties as
IFC president will be in the area
of public relations, Briscoe
feels. He said that Syd Farrah
(current IFC president) has
started a good community rela-
tions effort, and that he plans to
continue that trend.

As for the faculty, Briscoe
says that while he feels. the
fraternities as a group have
been ‘‘over-discriminated
against lately,”’ that encourag-
ing signs such as the IFC-
members higher GPA overall,
would put the IFC in ‘‘a better
bargaining position.”

Briscoe also said, however,
that he would try ‘‘a little more
understanding of the faculty
viewpoint’’ and added that ‘‘I
am going to do my best to
understand the faculty because
it is good to hear all sides of the
issue, even from the more
outspoken members of the
faculty.”

Faculty problems with the
IFC seem to be ‘‘fizzling out”’ in
Briscoe’s opinion, though, and
he says he hopes that trend will
continue, and that the faculty
will respect a stronger and
more judicially strict IFC.

One of Briscoe’s objectives
for next year is the formation of
a food co-op among the frater-
nities. He said that while this
idea was still in the planning
stages, such a program would
provide a ‘financial stability”
which many of the fraternities
need.

The IFC president said that
he would appoint a small com-
mittee to work on the idea over
the summer, but that in any
event if a co-op were to be
started, the management of the
project ‘‘should be solely in the
hands of the IFC.”

Briscoe added that he also
looks forward to fewer frater-
nities taking out major loans,
improving the financial situa-
tion of the fraternities as a
whole.

Another objective is ‘‘more
active participation at the
grass-roots level of the IFC by
fraternity members.” ,

Briscoe added that, ‘‘I think
the frats in general are on an
upswing—I am looking forward
to a good year and a smooth
path.”

Prof. Griffith Discusses

than in the actuality. Certainly there are many
students who continue to speak, like they always
have, but not nearly as many as in the past.

‘‘In the recent years I have had many students,
students whom I have taught, pass by without the
slightest recognition of my existence. The reason
that this bothers me is not that a tradition has been
broken, after all, we probably have some tradi-
tions that should be destroyed.

‘But I look on speaking as a simple symbol peo-
ple have of recognizing those whom they are
associated with in a common pursuit. I speak to
you, even if I don’t know you, simply to say to you
that I recognize that you are a student and I am an
instructor, and we are both seeking the truth
together.

‘‘T can’t do my job without you and you can’t do
your job without me. We are partners, fellows, and
I think that is all that speaking involves. When this
tradition breaks down, when a student passes
without speaking, I feel that this reflects an at-
titude of ‘I don’t need you any more...I have used
you as much as I can and I discard you.’ I am hurt,
so to speak, by this in terms of an atmosphere that
I once enjoyed and an atmosphere that I see
dissipating very quickly.”’

Jim Feinman is a Ring-tum Phi staff writer and
wrote this story for the July issue of the W&L Aamni
magazine,

Dr. Griffith also has misgivings concerning re-
cent decisions of the administration and faculty,
although he hastens to explain that his criticism is
offered in a constructive spirit. ‘‘I want it clearly
understood by everyone that my 34 years here
have been a delightful experience,

‘‘T think the proof of that is during those years, I
never made a serious attempt to find another
job,”’ he said. “‘I have been totally committed to
this University and totally happy in my work. But
there are flaws in the job we are doing, myself in-
cluded, and while I don’t wish to appear complete-
ly negative, I think it is necessary to speak out on
these things.”

One area of criticism that Dr. Griffith offers is
in the major requirements and in the distribution
of courses each student must achieve. ‘‘In the past
ten years we have made graduation from
Washington and Lee easier. We have reduced the
requirements for graduation by two courses. It is
possible for a student to receive a Bachelor of Arts
Degree without ever taking an English course, a
mathematics course, or a history course.

‘“‘For a man to have a B.A. degree who cannot
say that ‘I have had at least one course in British
or American literature, or in the history of my
country; is almost like saying to a medical student
‘We award you a medical degree but you don’t
have to study anatomy.’”’

The school calendar and the placement of vaca-
tions is another matter of concern with Dr. Grif-
fith. ‘‘We have a system in which we almost pro-
vide a week of vacation after six weeks in the
classroom,”’ he said. ‘‘We interrupt the continuity
of the program by interspersing it with holidays.

“When we break the continuity of the
classroom, it breaks the chain of thought and cer-
tainly detracts from the kind of work that comes
by maintaining a long period of class attendance.
As an illustration, one of the reasons we went to
the three-term system with examinations before
Christmas was to avoid that two-week period of
holidays in which the momentum was lost before

 

exams.

 
 
 

 

   

he
“I heartily agreed with that decision, but look
what we have done now. We give a whole week’s
vacation before the Christmas exams, again
creating the type of problem that we were trying
to solve.”’

Dr. Griffith has noticed some changes in his
students over the years. Of his present students he
says, ‘‘Generally, the students want to learn, they
are interested in the work that I try to teach. But
the problem that I have with students is a basic
lack of industry in their willingness to discipline
their minds, to discipline their habits, to exert that
kind of initiative that they have to exert to reach
their maximum achievement.

“Of course there are still some excellent
students and there are some poor students, but
this would be my overall appraisal. I think the

students today have had a too easy life for them to
display this type of industry of which I am speak-
ing. Their general attitude is not ‘How much can I
produce’ but rather ‘How much can I consume.’ ”

Dr. Griffith feels that this problem is not without
remedy. ‘I think that this University has to pro-
vide even greater scholarship aid than it is
presently offering. We must be able to go into the
academic market and say to any industrious,
conscientious, ambitious boy from the poorest
economic background, ‘We want you at
Washington and Lee.’ And if that boy says he can’t
handle the financial aspects we can then say,
‘Don’t worry about the expenses, you can have
scholarship aid and receive the benefits of the fine
faculty and facilities that we have. ‘I think that if
we did more of this it would benefit those boys who
are not quite as industrious, but whose fathers can
afford to send them here, not to mention the
benefit the underprivileged boy would receive as
well.”’

Of his upcoming retirement, Professor Griffith
says, “It isa sad experience, although not as sad
as I anticipated. After such a long and pleasant ex-
perience there is always a certain sadness, but to
be quite honest, I am tired. I don’t like to go to the
classroom and teach when I feel that I wish I
didn’t have to go this morning. I don’t think that is
fair to the students or to me. I think the time has
come when we need new ideas from younger peo-
ple trained in a manner different from that in
which I was trained. I believe the department will
benefit from this, ‘new blood’, so to speak.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The UC Choice

At last there will be an election on this campus with
some genuine competition and choice. No less than 15
students applied for positions on next year’s Universi-
ty Council. The UC has gained in importance and will
probably be the battleground for the next war over
students’ rights at Washington and Lee.

This year has seen a faculty proposal made to not
only ban live bands from fraternities on weeknights
but also from appearing in the Cockpit. This proposal
was really an outgrowth of the faculty’s objection to
weeknight parties in general, but it is significant that
it was in the University Council where the issue was
raised and debated. Once again the UC is becoming
the important deliberative body it once was. No
longer is it restricted to discussion of the university
calendar and faculty EC minutes.

A broad range of personalities is represented on
Monday’s UC election ballot. The strongest can-
didates must be chosen because the UC, limited as it
is with no actual power, is the only forum where
students can express their viewpoints and have an op-
portunity to determine the outcome. We can petition
the faculty or the board of trustees, but only on the UC
are we given the chance to vote effectively and pro-
tect our diminishing freedoms. The student body’s
representatives must be capable and willing to take a
firm stand and stop the erosion of student rights at
W&L.

Use your vote wisely on Monday.

Mad Money

Eight months ago all the student organizations
were asked to tighten their belts because student
funds were less than the budgetary requests. Some
groups, like the W&L fencing club, got barely enough
money to survive. But the budget was tight—we were
told—and we were all supposed to bite the bullet
together (misery likes company?” ).

Well, the EC gave its long-awaited yearly financial
statement Monday night and guess what? The student
government has over $9,000 to play with in its ‘‘Stu-
dent Body Reserve Fund Account’’—$9,607.28, to be
exact. The EC has been very stingy with this money,
‘orcing everyone to undertake austerity measures. In
‘act, this account now has almost $200 more in it that
it did back in August.

With only one month remaining in the school year,
we were wondering what about the fate of all that nice
cash now collecting dust in the vault. Most organiza-
tions stopped borrowing large emergency funds from
the account in October. The largest withdrawal since
then has been $100 (which was repaid) — hardly a
justification for maintaining a $9,000 balance. The
money will not be needed next year because a wind-
fall of cash will come out of a legal defense fund
escrow account now maintained in case the Student
Activities Board is sued over last spring’s aborted
Firefall concert.

So, it looks like it may be time for a few needy
organizations to make another pilgrimage to the EC
room. There’s no need to let that money go to waste
and non-profit organizations don’t require a surplus,
now do they?

Opening The Door A Crack

THE STUDENT BODY EXECUTIVE COMMIT-
TEE has been very busy this week revising
Washington and Lee’s honor system. The commit-
tee has been appropriately deliberative
throughout this annual ritual of changing the
White Book. And as usual, few significant changes
have been made; it has been mostly a process of
closing the gaps that became apparent in the
course of two open honor hearings.

Out of 23 proposed changes, over half failed or
were withdrawn from consideration. Among the
most significant revisions passed were those
which allow a transcript of testimony given at the
private honor hearing to be used at the open public
trial. One of the proposals states the matter quite
explicitly: “‘If...it appears...that the testimony of
that witness differs significantly from his
testimony given in the private hearing, the person
questioning the witness may approach the Chair-
man and call this fact to his attention.”

Admitting testimony given in the private hear-
ing is a significant change in procedure in the
honor system with ominous overtones— ominous
for what it implies. It implies that the testimony
given in.the last open honor trial was indeed dif-
ferent from that given during the closed honor
hearing (testimony given during the EC honor
hearing was not admissible in the recent open stu-
dent body hearing). If this is true—and we may
never know for sure—then Washington and Lee's
honor system is in serious trouble. Evidence of the
shaky foundation on which our honor system now
rests became evident in the course of the meeting
to change the White Book in both the proposed
changes and the comments made by several EC
members.

Consider this sampling of statements by EC
members:

—Jay Blumberg (senior EC rep.)
honor code may be in trouble.”
‘We've been elected to do a job and we should do it
despite the fact that we've been slapped down by
the student body,’’ Dee Keesler (senior EC rep. )
said in reference to the last open honor trial.
—John Fraser (law school EC rep.) - ‘It is my opi-
nion that the honor system no longer functions at
the law school.”’

THERE WAS ALMOST AN AIR OF PARANOLA
in the EC room Monday night—concern for both
the EC’s own image on campus and for the future

- “] think the

of the honor system. Many have sensed for a long
time that the honor system is in trouble, but it is
only now that our officials elected to uphold the
system are admitting it publicly. Such an admis-
sion is significant and disheartening. That is why
this year’s White Book changes are so important.

Most of the changes proposed to shore up the
honor system have come from law school
representative John Fraser. One of his proposed
changes was to eliminate the ‘‘single sanction,” or
permanent dismissal from the university for con-
viction of an honor offense. This revolutionary
proposal was made as a result of Fraser’s assess-
ment that the honor code does not work in the law
school because no one wants to be responsible for
booting a fellow student out of school and ruining
his career. It failed 2-10.

THE MOST INTRIGUING CHANGE was to
allow “‘observers’’ to view the closed proceedings.
Many on the committee seemed to like the idea of
opening the door a little to allow some of us:on the
outside to view the now secret proceedings. But
there was disagreement as to who the three
observers should be—friends of the accused or
randomly chosen students. Although the
“observer’’ proposal failed 3-9, there does seem
hope for a compromise solution which would allow
the honor process to be opened slightly—but only
at the discretion of the accused. An opening of the
honor system can only strengthen and improve it
by making students more aware of its pervasive
impact on this campus. The EC should reconsider
this important proposal and vote to allow
observers in the now closed EC hearings. Only
then will the students begin to regain respect for
this institution and for the manner in which the EC
tries to uphold it.

There was an obvious tone of frustration and
disillusionment in the comments made by several
EC members Monday night. But there was also a
sense of determination to preserve the system. We
are fortunate that this year's EC is so dedicated to
conscientiously carrying out its appointed duties.
A slightly open trial would ensure fairness in the
proceedings and dispel any lingering doubts in
students’ minds about the EC's motives and con-
duct during private honor hearings. The
“observer proposal is one whose time has
come—it should be implemented, before it is too
late.

Proposed EC White Book Changes

Proposal A
1. The student will be expelled = the University
for at least a period of one year. 2. Anytime after
the expiration of the year the ales may petition
once for readmission to the University.

FAILED - 2-10
submitted by: John Fraser

debate (Fraser): ‘It is my opinion that the honor
system no longer functions at the law school.”’
Students are unwilling to report honor offenses
because the student reported may be thrown out of
school.

(Allen) - ‘This is one of the few single sanction
honor systems left in the country, and if people
aren't going to turn in honor violators, then the
system isn’t working.’

Proposal E
“The hearing shall be closed to all but the
following persons: Executive Committee
members, witnesses, the accused and his ad-

visors, and up_to three members of the
Washington and Lee student body designated as
observers, The students present as observers shall
be removed from the hearing if any of them inter-
rupt the proceeding in any fashion. A potential
witness may not be an observer. The observers
shall not be permitted to take notes or record the
proceeding in any other manner.”’

FAILED - 3-9
submitted by: John Fraser
voting in favor: Fraser, Blumberg, Allen

debate: (Fraser) - ‘If a student wants to bring ina
reporter from the Ring-tum Phi, that is his
business.”

(Blumberg) - ‘‘I think the honor code may be in
trouble. The more we can show how the pro-
ceedings are conducted, the more people will
realize that we don’t try to go after people.”’

Dee Keesler and Les Cotter worried about the ac-
cused bringing in three friends who might spread
rumors after the trial about the accused (Keesler)
- “The motive of this proposal is to legitimize
honor proceedings. We've been elected to do a job
and we should do it despite the fact that we've
been slapped down by the student body (reference
to the last open honor trial). Passing this proposal
would show that the EC is too insecure about its
own proceedings and that’s why (the proposal)
sucks.”’

(Blumberg) - ‘‘What better observers can we have
than three friends of the accused? If they say (the
proceeding) was a fair honor hearing, people will
be sure it was fair.”

Proposal G

‘*...(The accused) shall be told that the testimony
given during the course of the hearing, including
that of the accused, will be recorded. A transcript
of this recording will be made available for use by
the EC advocates, the accused and his advisors,
and the Chairman in the event a Student Body
hearing is requested.”’

PASSED - unanimous
submitted by: Cove Geary

Proposal L
“If a student is found guilty in either an EC
Hearing or a Student Body Hearing a notation will
be made on the student’s official transcript that
the student left the University as the result of an
Honor Violation.”

FAILED - 1-11
submitted by: Jay Blumberg

debate: (Blumberg) - ‘‘This school has an obliga-
tion to other schools to tell them that the student
left W&L as a result of an honor violation.”
(Wenke) - ‘I don’t think we should persecute so-
meone their whole life.”’

Persiflage

(Blumberg) - ‘My purpose is not to persecute but
to inform future employers about his character.”
(Wenke) - ‘Our only purpose here is to ensure that
an atmosphere of trust exists in W&L’s society,
not to be concerned with his later life.”

Proposal S$

“If, in the course of questioning a witness, it ap-
pears to an EC advocate, the accused, or his ad-
visors that the testimony of that witness differs
significanUJy_{rom bis testimovy_given in the
private hearing, the person questioning the
witness may approach the Chairman and call this
fact to his attention. The Chairman shall compare
the transcript with the allegedly inconsistent
testimony and rule on the admissibility of the
evidence of the testimony given in the private
hearing. The accused is considered a witness if he

Support The Rites Of Spring

I hate to draw down upon myself the rath of
W&L’s large feminist population, but I must print
the truth in the best traditions of journalism,
yellow or otherwise.

There occurs every spring a rather amazing
phenomenon among the surrounding girl’s
schools. After years of fastidiously guarding their
vaunted reputations, the graduating seniors of our
neighboring sister schools realize the error of
their ways and attempt to rectify the situation as
rapidly and rabidly as possible.

While some might argue that the only reason to
take note of this annual purging of virtue is in
order that one might take full advantage of the
situation, I believe that there are other reasons to
study the development.

It appears that, to the practicioners of this rite
of spring, virtue is not an end in itself. Rather, the
preserving of one’s virtue is seen as merely the ac-
cepted way of achieving some degree of respect
from the opposite sex. Deep down, except for those

      

who were brought up on a strict diet ot the nur -
rors’’ of the human body, females have the same
desires as we nasty old boys.

It seems rather ridiculous that we deny
ourselves the pleasure of each other’s physical
charm solely for the purpose of perpetuating a
social hoax. We are not total lechers and they are

~ not bundles of sugar and spice.

I propose that we throw off the burden of this
hypocrisy.

The women of the area should blaze a trail of
openness that will act as an example to the women
of the nation. They should openly and freely show
their common bond with their fellow male
students by joining together with us in the beauty
of physical pleasure.

However, time is short. We must act as quickly
as possible to perform as many of these unions as
possible before the onslaught of summer.

Women of the world unite! You have nothing to
lose and a lot of meaningful relationships to gain!

Next year’s EC has been meeting to determine appointments for various committees. Pictured are Jim

Vines, Bud White and Bob Willis.

EC Hears Monthly Reports

(continued from page 1)

In other business Monday
night, the EC made a little pro-
gress on its investigation of
ticket scalping and recom-
mended to the Student Activi-
ties Board and the University
Center Committee that infor-
mation should be printed on
tickets sold in the future that
scalpers should be turned in.

“The realities of the world
are that if you allow people to
buy large blocks of tickets,
someone will scalp them,”’ said
law school representative Sam
Allen. He suggested more con-
trol over ticket sales and that

Notice

The student body Executive
Committee is now accepting ap-
plications for the positions of
student member-at-large on the
faculty EC.

‘T think it’s very important to
have two students on the com-
mittee because it deals with stu-
dent concerns,’ EC _ vice-
president Les Cotter said.

The vacancy is senior Tony
Carli’s. Carli is away from the
university for the spring term.

ticket purchases be limited.

“There's really not a whole
lot we can do to stop it (scalp-
ing),’’ said Jamie Small, UCC
chairman. (The UCC provides
entertainment for the Cockpit. )

The EC hopes the warning
that scalpers will be turned in
will reduce the resale of enter-
tainment tickets for profit.

Channing Hall, co-chairman
of the Contact committee,
reported that the group has
$3,946 remaining in its budget
and that plans are now under-
way for bringing the Contact
program's last speaker to cam-
pus on May 21 or 22.

(W&L graduate and author
Thomas Wolfe will speak as
part of the Contact program
next Wednesday, May 7. (See
story, page 3.)

John Hamilton, business
manager of the Calyx, said that
the yearbook should be in ‘‘the
third week of May.” He also
predicted that the book would
make a profit this year.

Guy Steuart of the Mock Con-
vention committee reported
that the $1,500 ‘‘elephant fund”’
has raised $900 to date.

He said that the committee is
having no budget problems for
next weekend’s Mock Conven-
tion.
