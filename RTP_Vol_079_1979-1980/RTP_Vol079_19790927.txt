Publishing prices’ for
Washington and Lee’s yearbook
have gone up $1,200, Calyx’s
business manager, John
Hamilton, said at Monday’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

The new price, set at
$10,219.70 was blamed on higher
paper prices, a cover costing
$100 more and a_ larger
allowance for corrections now
set at $1,000.

Failure to continue a three-
year contract with the Hunter
Publishing Co. would force the
Calyx to rebate a two percent
discount savings for the past
two years.

The E.C. voted unanimously
to forward $5,000 to the com-
pany and discuss the remaining
amount later.

SAB Spanked

Verbally spanking the S.A.B.
again, the E.C. continued its
discussion on lack of publicity
for their past meeting.

“I was a little bit mad that no
signs were up for the Sunday
night meeting,’’ said Senior
E.C. Representative Jay
Blumberg. ‘I registered my
complaint with Harpole and
Ridge. It happened that there

Washington and Lee University

was a very important deci-
sion.”’

The decision discussed was
the feasibility of celebrating
Fancy Dress with the alumni.

Suspect Held;
Goods Recovered

by Sam Campbell

A laborer from Lexington,
and an undetermined number of
juveniles have been arrested in
connection with a robbery over
the summer at the Pi Kappa
Alpha house.

According to Lexington
Police Chief James .A. Kirby,
Anthony Wayne Higgins, 19, has
been charged with two counts of
receiving stolen goods and four
counts of contributing to the
delinquency of a minor. The
robbery occurred in June, but
the losses weren’t determined
until the occupants of the house
returned this fall.

‘*..(University Proctor)
Charles Murray does a real
good job watching the frater-
nities during the summer, and

he did report the burglary, but
we had no way of knowing what
was missing until the students
began showing up again, ‘‘ Kir-
by said.

Investigating Officer John
Colbert said that one speaker
and two amplifiers had been
recovered, and the investiga-
tion is continuing. When asked
if this was part of a contracting
operation, with the defendant
paying the juveniles to break in-
to the house and steal the stereo
equipment, Colbert replied,
“That’s exactly what’s happen-
ing.”’

Higgins has been released on
$2,000 bond, with trial set for
October 16 in Rockbridge Coun-
ty General District Court. Trial
has been set in Juvenile Court
for October 19.

imately 5,000 attended Fancy
Dress.

Three alternatives were con-
sidered. One would bar alumni
invitations, another would limit
the amount of alumni tickets on
a first-come, first-serve basis,
or moving the party to the
Warner Center.

Exclusion of the alumni
would not satisfy the fire code
capacity. Undergraduate and
law school students with dates
would still overload the building
with a possible 3,400. This also
does not include faculty invita-
tions.

Considers

Barring

by David Greer
W&L Alumni will not be in-
vited to attend Fancy Dress
Ball this year, the SAB ten-
tatively decided Sunday. The
Ball will be held in the Student
Center.

The decision to allow only
students, faculty, and _ staff
came after 5,000 persons attend-
ed last year’s ball. The capacity
of the Student Center, including
the dining hall is 2,139.

The fear of a fire is the major
factor in deciding to limit the at-
tendance.

See Letter to the Editor
on page 10.

 

The Student Activities Board
first voted to hold the ball in the
gymnasiums and to allow alum-
ni to attend. This decision was
revoked after the SAB discuss-
ed the logistics of having the
ball there.

Problems lay in the immense
area to decorate, the locating of
several activities in two gyms
and a classroom, and the at-
mosphere. “‘It’ll look like your
high-school prom,’’ said Jamie
Small.

Last year, 600 to 650 alumni
and their dates attended Fancy
Dress. This year, one ticket per
student will be printed. A stu-
dent can sell his ticket to
whomever he pleases.

The Student Activities Board
will meet at 7 p.m. on Sunday in
Room 208 in the University

Center building to discuss fur-

ther plans for this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball. All students are in-
vited to attend.

Fancy Dress will be held this
‘ year on February 29.

 

 

Homecoming Weekend

 

Allstars To Play

Final arrangements are be-
ing made to bring the Allstars,
from Charlottesville, back to
the Cockpit on Thursday, Oc-
tober 4th, for a show that should
really help kick off the
Homecoming weekend. The
Allstars, one of the most
popular bands in this region,
have no trouble delighting pack-
ed houses every time they play
here.

The University Center Com-
mittee received $500 from the

Executive Committee last week
to book the band, and UCC
chairman Jamie Small said
that the contract has _ been
delivered, and only the last
details remain to be worked out.
Small forsees no problems.

At this time, only one show
has been planned, with a limit
of 200 people allowed. Tickets
will be sold at the door for $1.00
to W&L students and $2.00 to
others. Watch for the time of the
show to be announced.

Letter From S.A.B.

(continued from page 10)

And there is the most difficult
aspect of putting off a Fancy
Dress, that of putting the theme
to work, so to speak, by making
all of the ideas pertaining to a
theme blend together. This is
what makes Fancy Dress what
it is, and not a high school prom.
This is what will be missed.

The second part of my argu-
ment concerns alumni.
Although Fancy Dress is un-
doubtedly the big weekend At
W&L, it certainly is not the only
weekend alumni attend. There
is, of course, Homecoming,
which is especially designed for
alumni, and the annual Spring
Reunion, which promises to get
bigger in years ahead.

As I’m sure many alumni will
agree, the priority lies with the
students of W&L. I’m also sure
that alumni would sacrifice
their privilege to attend Fancy
Dress if it meant preserving the
most prestigious collegiate
social event in the South. Not
even alumni want to go to a
Fancy Dress that smells of
socks and jocks. As an alumnus
to be, I would subscribe to these
views.

The initial motion to have
Fancy Dress in the gym passed
8-3. But after further discus-

Wenke
Arrives
In Korea

Michael F. Wenke, a 1979
graduate of Washington and
Lee, arrives in Korea this week
to begin a ten-month internship
as a Luce Scholar assigned to
the Korean Amateur Basketball
Association in Seoul.

Wenke is one of fifteen Luce
Scholars for 1979-80 who com-
prise the sixth group chosen in a
national competition for par-
ticipation in this program
operated by the Henry Luce
Foundation.

‘he Luce Scholars Program
was established by the founda-
tion in 1973 to give outstanding
young Americans an exposure
to Asia at an early stage in their
careers.

The 15 winners of Luce
Scholar awards in 1979 average
25 years-of-age and include 10
men and five women. The pro-
fessional fields they represent
range from medicine to music
and include philosophy, law,
finance, film-making, jour-
nalism, psychology, and social
work.

The competition for 1980-81
Luce Scholars is already under-
way. Nominating institutions
have been asked to present
their candidates to the Henry
Luce Foundation no later than
December 3.

Interested seniors, graduate
or professional school students,
or recent alumni under age 30
are asked to contact the local
Luce Scholar liaison, Dr. Edwin
D. Craun,

Fancy Dress Problems

(continued from page 1)

Last year, the S.A.B. used too
many flammable materials,
added Student Body President
Steve Abraham. “If they had it
in the gym, everybody could
come,’’ he said.

“T think everyone should hold
their opinions until next week,”’
said Dee Keesler, Senior
Representative to the E.C.

SAB co-chairman David Har-
pole left with the E.C.’s wishes
that the communication situa-
tion improve significantly.

Gerald Darrell, director of
the University Dining and Food
Services, addressed the E.C. on
relations between the Universi-
ty Center Committee and the
Cockpit, and also on current
financial structure. Saying an
understanding had been reach-
ed between himself and U.C.C.
chairman Jamie Small, Darrell
went on to say that beer sales
during concerts are the only

way to offset losses on low sales

shutting down at times,”’ sai:
Darrell, refering to the Cockp
hours between 2 and 9 p.m.

“We don’t have a stead
business that we can rely on,
said Darrell. ‘‘The advantage ¢
that restaurant is that we don
have to make a profit. All w
have is to is operate in th
black.”’

A Rugby Club request for .
$600 loan was approved. Th
Club promised to return th
money in two weeks.

The loan, given because of <
C.0.D. uniform delivery ex
pected later this week, was em
phasized as just a loan. The
Rugby Club stated that in
dividuals will pay for their owr
uniforms.

Instead of a Freshman’s Guide—

Senator Howard Baker

 

The Ring-tum Phi, Sept. 27, 1979, Page 3

 

Howard Baker Profiled

Tennessee Senator Howard
Baker all but formally announc-
ed his bid for the 1980
Republican _ presidential
nomination in a TV appearance
May 6. Responding to inquiries
about his possible candidacy on
“Face the Nation,’’ Baker
replied, ‘‘ You know I am a can-
didate...I!’m running hard, I
have a good organization and I
plan to win.”’

This announcement by the 55-
year-old Senate Minority
Leader casts him into an
already cluttered field of GOP
presidential hopefuls, among

| them John Connally, George

Bush, Philip Crane, Bob Dole
and, although he has yet to
declare his candidacy, Ronald
Reagan.

In recent polls, though, Baker
has emerged reasonably well,
often placing behind Reagan,
Ford and Connally as the most
desirable Republican presiden-

tial candidate.

No stranger to Washington,
Baker first served as a Senator
in 1966, winning handily over
longtime Tennessee governor
Frank Clement.

In 1972, he won re-election
with an impressive 62% of the
vote, carrying all eight of the
Sstate:s congressional districts,
and his '78 election was equally
decisive. Baker's struggle to
grasp Senate Minority Leader
was just that. He managed to
pull one more vote than Robert
Griffin, his opponent in a heated
contest. Baker had tried for the
position two times before
without success.

The Senator first received na-
tional exposure as the ranking
Republican on the Senate
Watergate Committee, and his
name was brought frequently
as Ford’s most probable runn-
ing mate on the ’76 GOP ticket
(although, of course, Robert
Dole was eventually chosen).

A Reporter’s Probing Investigation

I was sure the moment I saw
her, although she seemed
uncertain at first and perhaps
was originally only charmed by
my matching watchband and
belt—anyway I was_ positive
that she was the one.

Perhaps you noticed her too”
It was last Friday night at that
Frat House with the white
pillars—I can never remember
its name—anyhow you know the
one I mean.

I first saw her standing there
at the entrance to the dining
room, where tapes were playing
and people were dancing. She
looked so unlike all the other
girls as she stood there in her
kelly green monogramed
sweater, navy blue (except for
those little green grogs, whales
or whatever) skirt and
topsiders—I knew she was dif-
ferent from the word go.

I slowly made my way toward
her speaking casual greetings
to friends (and anyone else I
passed) hoping that she would
notice my popularity and
charm. When our eyes first met
she sort of smiled (naturally
she was shy) so I decided the
first line would have to come
from me.

‘‘Hi—can I get you a beer?”

What?" she replied. It oc-
curred to me at first that she
might not have heard me over
the blarring music, but more
than likely she was probably
trying to play hard to get so I
decided that I would go along
with her game.

“WOULD YOU LIKE A
BEER,” I repeated. This time
she had to admit she heard me
and she nodded in approval. As
we walked to the patio we in-
troduced ourselves and ex-
changed vital statistics such as
hometown, year in school and
major.

There was a slight line as we
reached the keg so I explained
to her that this frat had the best
beer on campus. She looked a
little puzzled so I went on to
clarify my statement by admit-
ting that although it was the
same brand served by other
Frats, it was their specially
designed aluminum kegs that
made all the _ difference.
Needless to say, this really im-
pressed her.

As we drank our beers we
chatted about many things such
as her recent trip to Europe and
her Daddy’s business, and when
we were finished we decided to
dance.

During the next hour or two
we spent equal time between
the dance floor and the beer keg
and finally ended up on the
couch engaged in stimulating
conversation. Before we cculd
go further I felt that she should
know my true motive for trying
to get to know her. I confessed

that I was the Ring-tum Phi’s
star investigative reporter and
that I must have her
(figuratively speaking) for an
in depth interview,

She was of course, over-

whelmed that she should be the
one chosen for my probing arti-
cle, and then meekly blushed
and said she only hoped she
would be able to satisfy my
needs. I quickly assured her
that the pleasure was indeed
mine.

She smiled and I slipped my
arm around her waist (merely
to reassure her), and then led
her off to my posh Woods Creek
apartment where I traditionally
conduct such nocturnal in-
vestigations. | dare say you
would scarcely believe all I un-
covered in this extensive and
prevailing interview (which on-
ly proves that Mom was right
about beauty being more than
skin deep), and although we

were both exhausted by Sunday
afternoon when we bid adieu,
we were nevertheless complete-
ly satisfied with our endeavor.

But now dear readers comes
the sad part of my story upon
your sympathy and understan-
ding toward the cruel trick
which fate has played on me. On
returning from the Cockpit Sun-
day night, I found that the tape
on which I had recorded my en-
tire interview had been (ex-
pletives deleted) erased. Alas
my friends I have no record of
my deepest and most satisfying
probe, but all is not lost—I still
have some great photos—
perhaps they can be arranged
into a pictorial for next week’s

As Congress considers SALT
II, Baker's positions on the
Foreign Relations Committee
and the Arms Control Subcom-
mittee will offer him added na-
tional recognition.

Ideologically, Baker is hard
to define. He has opposed many
of the traditionally held conser
vative views during his career
his most recent defection being
support of the Panama Canal
Treaties—a position which
many Republicans claim will
seriously damage his nomina
tion chances. During the great

Baker was one of the few
southern politicians who chose
not to exploit the situation,
although he could have preach-

ed racism effectively in

nessee.

It is expected that much of
Baker’s support will come trom
moderate Republicans, par
ticularly Ford’s old supporters
He has few enemies in the party
and in the case of a deadlocked
convention, he might be ad-
vanced as a compromise can

Higgins Chairs DuPont Showing ,¢ p,;,

Doug Higgins has an exhibit
of paintings and drawings in the
DuPont Gallery through Oct. 5.

The exhibit is made of three
groupings of material. The
most prominent is a series of oil
paintings of chairs. There is a
selection of pencil drawings.
Plus there is a series of mixed
media ensembles.

The large, colorfilled oils of
chairs have twisted and exag-
gerated parts of the object. The
parts of the chair patch in even-
ly applied color. Higgins tries to
“flatten out the painting.’’ He
said that he aims only to paint.
He tries not to create an “‘illu-
sion on paper representing a
three dimensional object.’’ The
oils are of two sets, one using oil
and gaouch and the other only
oil.

The oil and gaouch are snap-
pier and are more preplanned.
They remind me of the packag-
ing for a Matchbox car, or
Saturday cartoons on color TV.
The words help present the pic-
ture as a literal work. Higgins
describes it as a dialogue bet-
ween himself and the paper.

‘‘CAFE-CHAIR-
NANTUCKET” has purple and
green strips making up the
backing and seat of the chair.
The white armrests spread
across the paper. There are
touches of pink amost on a
horizon that are distinctive.
There are no shadows. Shadows
are real, he’s painting a picture.

The second set of chair oils
are bigger, cruder. The frames
are wooden strips even with the
surface of the painting. Their
are swiped on bands of color for
a frame. These paintings have
the quick, forceful look of con-
struction work. ‘NANTUCKET
STREET CHAIR” has the
startling colors webbed across
black for tar.

The sketches are squiggles
from the color pencils and thin
black outlines. The sketches are
exercises with color and form.
They are a held lysergerized vi-
sion, almost a flash-back. He
gives typical touristy pictures
of seascapes, landscapes, and
museum foyers. He overex-
poses color groupings to form a
scene. With his drawings Hig-
gins says he “represent a quick
record of my concept.”

These paintings are a sample of Doug Higgins’ works, ranging from oils and pencils to mixed media

ensembles.

Signal flags are waving all over the place.
Washington and Lee alumnus, Tom Wolfe,
‘51, has just published what looks to be a top-
notch, solid best seller. In The Right Stuff
Wolfe has turned his keen eye and kinetic pro-
se to a history of the first seven American
astronauts, a’ la the New (now read middle-
aged?) Journalism.

Tom Wolfe’s prose fires off like a capsule on
top of a 13-story pencil loaded with compress-
ed explosive. His story of the selection, train-
ing and exploitation of the early space ex-
plorers is worthy of his razzle-dazzle style.

According to remembrances of Tom
Wolfe’s days at Washington and Lee there
were no hints of the flamboyance to come.
Charles McDowell, in an article in the Alumni
Magazine, Spring 1965, says Wolfe was “a
good student, good influence and a promising
writer,” with an ‘tambition to be the world’s
greatest pitcher’. He did succeed in manag-
ing the baseball team. He also was sports
editor of the Ring-tum Phi, and contributed to
Shenandoah, W&L’'s literary magazine. After

 

ye and Ear: from the Bookstore

graudation in 1951 he went to Yale getting a
PhD. in Sociology, which he has called ‘‘the
social side of political activity among
writers.”

His subsequent career as an enfant terrible
in New York journalism is being retold these
days in Time; Saturday Review; and lead ar-
ticles in the New York Times Book Review
and Chronicle of Higher Education. No word,
however, is in the New Yorker, a magazine
that Wolfe has written about with less than
reverence.

His two most recent appearances at W&L
were both colorful. In the dead of winter, 1967,
he spoke in Lee Chapel dressed in his
customary white suit with a chartreuse chif-
fon handerchief cascading from his pocket.
Then in May, 1974 while wearing a black gown
over his white suit, a blue and white hood was
placed on his shoulders: an Honorary Doctor
of Letters from his Alma Mater.

Today, the frustrated pitcher has become a
wide receiver of praise and attention for his
latest blast-off. Terrific, as he would say.

sional pictures is conceptualiz-
ed with his mixed media. They
are collages of magazine cutups
of bits of chairs, patches of pen-
cil color, tape around the sides,
and graph paper. These images
represent a real chair as much
as an accountant’s graph
represents what happens in the
selling place.

A friend said ‘‘some of it is
really good, some of it is really
absurd. Like the prices.”

To accurately recreate the

work I’d have to show you the
rough draft of this. That

the W&L team on the proposi-
tion that “America is governed

The visitors will argue
against the assertion. The
Washington and Lee men—
junior Steve Bigler and senior
Sam Perkins—will take the af-
firmative side. All community
members are invited to witness
the showdown, which is
scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. in

Bands In
Cockpit

by Alan Kendrick

The University Center Com-
mittee, under chairman Jamie
Small, has been formed this
year to provide a consistent
schedule of good bands in the
Cockpit for W&L_ students.
Already, the UCC has made
plans to bring the Allstars here
on Oct. 4th.

In the past year or so, under
the guidance of Burr Datz,
more and more bands have
been brought to the Cockpit to
provide a variety of live enter-
tainment to students.

According to Small, Datz and
others originally had to actively
seek out bands to play here, but
now the bands are beginning to
call the Cockpit. ‘‘The Cockpit
is beginning to get on the map
And hopefully we’ll be able to
draw even more bands from
Atlanta, D.C., New York, and
other big cities,’ said Small.

Small also reported that he
had spoken with Mr. Gerry Dar-
rell, Director of University Din-
ing and Food Service, and found
Mr. Darrell receptive to having
more bands in the Cockpit. The
Cockpit staff also wants to see
more bands play here.

On a few occassions last year,
a band was booked on the spur
of the moment, and the staff
was caught short of help, but
the UCC plans to work with the
staff this year and notify them
of all shows well in advance.

Small commented, ‘I want to
see the independents get a bet-
ter deal for social life, and the
freshmen, being so close to the
Cockpit, also stand to benefit.
The entertainment brought
here will provide everyone with
a good alternative to the usual
fraternity parties. By providing
a steady place for entertain-
ment, we can afford to go down
the road less by bringing the
road here.”’

Small added that because
students are not compelled to

come to Cockpit attractions, as
they are to their own prepaid
fraternity parties, the faculty
would probably have no objec-
tions to weeknight bands.

A large variety of bands was
provided last year, and Small
said this year would be even
better. ‘We will get everything
from punk rock to jazz,
southern, and blue grass. If
anyone wants to see a certain
type of music, we'll try to get it
in here.”’

Small added, ‘‘I hope students
are as psyched as I am about
getting good live entertainment
this year. It’s your Cockpit and
we want to help you get the
most out of it.”’

Meatballs has no plot, three

Murray plays the head of the

amed Rudy (Chris
akepeace) who needs to find
‘ceptance among his peers,
id Murray is after one of the

1e. Murray’s camp wins the
ter-camp olympics, Rudy

sceptance with his peers, and
(urray and Roxane decide to

The bits and scenes are about

humor is cleaner though, it’s
less profound, the sex is rude
rather than sick, and on the
whole the tone of Meatballs is
more enthusiastic and less
cynical.

Ivan Reitman’s direction is
mediocre. Rife with uninspired
camera angles and editing, the
movie works chiefly because of
the strength of the humor and
skill of Murray. Reitman did a
far better job as Co-producer of
Animal House.

Meatballs is pale compared to
Animal House. Without a
stronger plot the humor of
Meatballs, while funny, can
never achieve the moments of
Animal House. While I saw
Animal House three times, I
doubt I will see Meatballs
again.

No, I have no idea what
“‘Meatballs”’ refers to.

Having now seen the
previews to both North Dallas
Forty and Meatballs I am
amazed at how poor they (the
previews) are. Neither preview
tells one much about the move,
and both take disparate scenes
and re-edit them to create new
punch lines.

The preview to North Dalls
Forty has a tone completely op-
posite that of the movie and is
downright misleading. The
Meatballs preview gave away a
good number of punch lines, so
that during the movie I found
myself saying, ‘Oh, this must

be where he says....” thus
wrecking the joke.
Both of these previews

manage to mislead the viewer,

and don’t flatter the picture. So
who came up with these things?

Now, get out of here you
maniacs.

From the Pressbox:

Only JV. ?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Junior varsity sports are alive and well at W&L.

Despite a lack of emphasis, W&L’s six JV teams
continue to serve as both a ‘‘feeder”’ program for the
varsity squads and an avenue for student participa-
tion in intercollegiate athletics. The six JV
programs—soccer, basketball, tennis, lacrosse,
water polo and this year, football—are all considered
integral parts of their respective varsity programs.
Almost all of the varsity coaches whose programs in-
clude a JV team said the JV has been a big plus for
their program.

Several of the coaches feel that the JV teams allow
them to develop future players for the varsity squads.
They said they could accomplish this by letting

 

freshmen get actual game experience on the JV level ,

before letting them play for the varsity. However,
each coach has his own philosophy about the role the
JV program should play.

JV basketball coach Jim Casciano, who also assists
varsity coach Verne Canfield, described the JV pro-
gram as ‘“‘a feeder program to the varsity.” ““We hope
to get a couple of players out of each freshman class,”’
explained Casciano, ‘“‘It also provides the opportunity
for freshman members of the varsity squad to get
some playing time on the JV level.” This philosophy
has proved successful for Canfield'as three members
of the varsity team—Tom Jeffries, Pete Farrell and
R.J. Scaggs— are graduates of the JV program.

Varsity soccer coach Rolf Piranian also considers
the JV to be a feeder program to the varsity. Piranian
considers the JV to be a vital part of the varsity pro-
gram and said he has done ‘“‘a lot of work” to upgrade
it. The coach said he likes to consider the JV as a “B-
team” and treats the players on both squads in the
same manner. Contrary to the philosophy of the other
coaches, Piranian likes to bring several JV players up
to the varsity team at the end of the JV season. One of
this year’s captains of the varsity, Doug Seitz, is just
one of several players on the varsity roster who spent
time on the JV level.

Probably the strongest of the JV programs is the JV
lacrosse team. Every year the varsity squad includes
at least one former JV player. Former JVers on last
year’s team were captain Sandy McDonald, Art
Caltrider, Mark Ottinger and Bart Peaslee. A few
years back, Doug Fuge worked his way up from the
JV level and was rewarded his senior year when he
was selected as an honorable mention All-American.

Varsity coach Jack Emmer tries to limit the JV
program to freshman and sophomore players who
have aspirations of making the varsity. ‘I think the
JV has allowed us to keep people involved in the
lacrosse program and at the same time allowed
younger players to develop their skills before moving
up to the varsity level,” said Emmer. He added that
“the JV program has also helped stimulate interest in
lacrosse on campus.”

Despite the popularity of the JV lacrosse program,
Emmer finds himself without a JV coach. Former JV
coach Rolf Piranian will become a full-time trainer at
the end of the fall season and will not coach the JV this
year. Emmer said he is still uncertain about the situa-

tion.

Just Call Him ‘Hoops’

by Dave Murray

"I; came here for the
challenge of playing the best
lacrosse in the country,” says
W&L midfielder John Hooper.
He thinks about it-and then
adds, ‘‘but don’t make it look
like the only reason I came here
was to play lacrosse.” He
laughs.

Hooper arrived at the Co-op
wearing a white cowboy hat. He
has just come from his home in
the country, a silver trailer
named the ‘Submarine.’ He
has also brought along his two
dogs. When asked about
himself, he would rather talk
about the team.

“The big names are all
gone,’”’ he said, “I don’t mean
that we don’t still have some ex-
cellent players, but the Fritzes
and the Blacks—they’re gone.
What’s left is a nucleus of team
players, very close
players...instead of relying on a
couple of guys, everybody’s
gonna have to contribute.”’

Last spring, Hooper was
elected by his teammates to
serve as a co-captain along with
second-team All—American
goalie Bob Clements. Coach
Jack Emmer said of ‘Hooper,
“He sets a fine example and I

think his teammates appreciate '

that.”

Hooper spent his freshman
year at the Univresity of Ver-
mont. He had been a three-sport
star in high school in
Maplewood, N.J. He played
guard and linebacker on the
football team, midfield on the
lacrosse team and also played
hockey. He decided after his
freshman year to transfer to
W&L and concentrate on
lacrosse.

It was never easy. His
sophomore year, before the
season started, Hooper suffered
from bursitis in his hips. Em-
mer stuck with him even though
he could not run for a while.
Finally, the doctors were able
to help and Hooper says now
that he has only occasional
pain.

But Emmer’s faith paid off.
“He never lost his enthusiasm
when he got hurt,’’ said the
coach. Hooper soon developed
into a fine midfielder and a key
player for the Generals.

Junior midfielder George
Santos remembered his first
impression of Hooper: ‘When I
first came here I thought he was
nuts.’’ He continued, ‘‘Here’s
this guy who has just transfer-
red, running around with a
marine haircut and growling on
face-offs. But after you get to
know him...he’s different.”

Hooper shared the face-off
duties with Clements and others
during his first season. He also
saw action as a defensive mid-
die Hooper made a lasting im-
pression on the W&L fans with
his hard hitting.

Hooper has never been a
flashy offensive player,
although he moves well without
the ball. He is a cutter. Emmer
notes, “John’s a hard worker
who gets the most out of his
ability.”

The NCAA changed the face-
off rule before the start of last
season to speed up the game. In-

 

Co-Captain John Hooper —

stead of a face-off after each
goal, the ball was brought into
play at midfield by the team
that was scored on. This promp-
ted the use of defensive
midfielders—specialists—and
Hooper was one of them. He
also contributed at the other

_end of the field with eight goals.

This year, the face-off rule
has been changed back to the
way it was. Hooper will share
the duty with Joe Olive and
others. Again he hesitates to
talk about himself.

“On any given day, our face--
off guys can stay with
anybody...everybody’s got their
own tricks. Between all of us,
we'll get our share. The face-off
is supposed to be individual, but
here it doesn’t have to be,”’ said
Hooper.

So how does a defensive mid-
die get to be a captain?
Manager Palmore Clark ex-
plains, ‘‘People really respect

Hoops. He’s just so intense. He
knows when to let loose at prac-
tice and at games ...that’s what
he’s there for.”

Emmer says of his captain,
“John’s his own man. He won’t
be afraid to speak up and tell
someone he’s out of line. He’s
more outspoken than captains
of the past.” |

One teammate called Hooper
the most physical player on the
team. Last season on the spring
trip, he broke W&L attackman
Pere Robert’s collarbone dur-
ing a collision at practice. ‘“‘He
popped me like he _ usually
does,”’ said Roberts.

Hooper’s ‘‘play hard-practice
hard” philosophy is simple.
“Well, you know,” he said,
“there’s an old saying—
Saturday is wash
day...whatever you’ve done
during the week comes out on
Saturday.” And Hoops seems to
Sparkle on Saturdays.

We Won!

Leiser Return Gives W&L 14-10 Win

by Dale Park

Last Saturday when Centre
College won the toss and elected ,
to receive the ball, head coach
Gary Fallon also allowed the
Colonels to pick which goal they
wanted to defend. ‘‘The kids —
were flat before the game”,
said Fallon, “‘and I thought that
letting the Colonels have their
own choice might get our
players excited.”

This philosophy obviously
paid off. Led by a superb defen-
sive effort, the Generals upend-
ed Centre College 14-10.

On the Cononel’s very first
play from scrimmage, Centre’s '
running back, Jim-Bob Green,
fumbled and an alert defensive
back Gene Newton recovered
for the Generals on the Col-
onel’s 38 yard line.

W&L quickly capitalized.
Sophomore Jim Wenke, making
his deubt as W&L’s starting
quarterback, lead the Generals
to the one yard line in seven
plays, setting up tail-back
Stewart Atkinson’s touchdown
plunge. The conversion was
good, making the score 7-0
W&L.

This proved to be the only
scoring drive the Generals had

all afternoon. But if the offense
had its problems, the defense
surely did not.

The Colonel’s only touchdown
drive came as a result of an in-
tercepted Wenke pass which
was taken to the General’s 13
yard line. Behind the running of
Mike Shannon, the Colonels
scored what proved to be their
only touchdown of the day.
After a successful two-point
conversion, Centre had the lead
8-7; but only for the moment.

On the subsequent kickoff,
Leiser took the ball at his own
seven yard line. Slicing up the
middle behind a well-formed
wedge, the junior slot-back rac-
ed 93 yards for a touchdown.

“Leiser’s run was a big lift”
said Fallon, ‘Because he im-
mediately countered Centre’s
previous scoring drive.”

For the day, Leiser gained 110
yards on two kickoff returns. He
gained an additional 15 yards on
two carries from scrimmage
and 10 yards on two pass recep-
tions.

With the conversion suc-
cessful, the Generals took the
lead 14-8 never to trail again.

The only other scoring that
took place in the first half oc-

cured as a result of a W&L
mistake. Late in the second
quarter, while attempting to
punt from their own endzone, an
errant W&L snap flew over Syd
Farrar’s head, crossing the
endzone backline. The safety
left the score at 14-10 as the half
came toan end.

Both teams lost the ball
through fumbles three times,
yet the Generals actually threw
more interceptions (two) than
Centre (one).

Despite an offense which
stagnated due to missed op-
portunities, the defense pulled
through. Defensive standouts
were sophomore noseguard
Mike Pressler, who recovered a
fumble, and Newton, who in-
tercepted a pass to go along
with his earlier fumble
recovery.

Next week the Generals
travel to Ashland to face
Randolph-Macon College.
Macon, 1978 ODAC Champions,
are favored to repeat as
champs again this year. Both
offensive and defensive units
have seven starters returning.

Game time is 2:00 p.m. at
Day Field.

W&L To Host North-South

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will be the site of the 39th
annual North-South Lacrosse
All-Star game, the United
States Intercollegiate Lacrosse
Association has announced. The
event, which features the na-
tion’s top seniors, is scheduled
for 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, June
14, 1980 and will take place at
W&L’s 7,000 seat Wilson Field.

‘Washington & Lee Universi-
ty is delighted to have been
chosen host for the North-South
game,”” commented Generals’
lacrosse coach Jack Emmer.
“This game has traditionally
been the showcase for the best

players in_ intercollegiate
lacrosse, and the W&L com-
munity is exicted about bring-
ing the game and its associated
festivities back to Lexington.”

The announcement of the
selection came from USILA
president Dick Clower, Athletic
Director at Western Maryland
College, and North-South Com-
mittee Chairman Richie Moran,
lacrosse coach at. Cornell
University. 1980 will mark the
second time Washington & Lee
has hosted the event, the first
being in 1970.

Festivities for the event begin
on Friday, June 13, with the All-

American Banquet. Saturday’s
game will involve approximate-
ly 54 players, who will be
selected prior to the NCAA
Championship in May. Coaches
will also be announced at that
time.

The South leads the 38-game
series 19-17-1 (the 1964 game
was called the ‘All-American
Classic’ and teams were
chosen using a different for-
mat). The North has won the
past five contests, including last
year’s 21-15 win at the Universi-
ty of Maryland at Baltimore
County.

Hero For a Day

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

The final score: Washington & Lee 14, Centre 10.
Yes, make no mistake about it, the Generals actually
won their first game of the season and in a most
unlikely way—beating a team no one had given them
a chance against.

Last Saturday, W&L was outrushed, outpassed,
fumbled the same amount as their opponents and
even received more penalties. But what the hell, a win
is a win.

When a football team wins, the entire squad gets
congratulated. But let’s be honest, only twelve men
deserve an ovation—the 11 players on defense and
Chris Leiser.

The Generals’ defense should have been paid time-
and-a-half for last Saturday’s performance. The
defense caused four turnovers, including one fumble
which resulted in one of W&L’s two scores.

More importantly, the defense caused that turnover
on Centre’s first offensive play of the game, giving the
Generals enough momentum to score twice. Still, the
defensive heroics might have gone unnoticed had it
not been for another player—Chris Leiser.

His height is listed at 5-8, he weighs 170 pounds and
stands taller than only three other men on the squad.
Chris Leiser would not be your first choice in a pick-
up basketball game.

If you’re starting a football team, however, it’s
hard to overlook this guy. How many other players
can be used at quarterback, running back, wide
receiver and even return kicks?

At the first three positions, Leiser can do an ade-
quate job. Last Saturday, Leiser earned his keep by
returning kicks—an art he perfected against Centre.

Having taken a quick 7--0 lead only to fall behind
8-7, the Generals had to be emotionally in the dumps.
To pick up a team in this type of situation, you need a
big play—which is where Leiser fits in.

All Leiser did was take a kickoff from his seven
yard line and race 93 yards untouched for the
Generals’ final touchdown. Had Leiser not scored or
had the defense not played as well as they did, the
Generals would have probably lost because their of-
fense was practically negligible after the first
quarter.

Of course, anyone can run from one end of the foot-
ball field to the other, but try it returning a punt or a
kickoff with 11 angry players running towards you at
full speed. It can be a fatal experience.

What made Leiser’s run so special was the com-
bination of three factors: good running, good blocking
and a little luck. Leiser’s teammates formed a solid
wedge up the middle of the field, allowing the
speedster to go relatively untouched for most of the
jaunt.

By the time he reached the 30 yard line, Leiser
made a quick cut that left him only one more oppo-
nent away from the goal line. That man was Centre’s
kicker, who fortunately did not seem too thrilled with
the idea of trying to tackle Mr. Leiser.

In contrast to almost every other position on the
field (excepting the two kicker Spots), kick returning
is a lonely job. With the ever-present danger of fumbl-
ing, it’s not too big 4 leap from hero to goat in one
afternoon.

He might fumble everytime he gets the ball this
Saturday, but for the moment, Chris Leiser is a hero.

From the Pressbox

(continued from page 6)

Because of his late arrival at W&L, water polo
coach Page Remillard was unable to recruit and is
presently without a formal JV program. ‘“‘I did my
first recruiting during the freshman swimming test.
From that alone I recruited seven freshmen who I’m
very pleased with,’’ said Remillard. He explained
that because of a lack of numbers, there will be no for-
mal JV squad this year but there will be one next
year. Remillard is presently using his water polo
physical education class as an informal JV program.
The coach added, ‘‘The JV program will be developed
as numbers dictate.”

Although varsity tennis coach Gary Franke
believes the JV program should act as a feeder in an
idealistic sense, he said that realistically it often
doesn’t happen that way. “The JV team is
idealistically for freshmen and sophomores who have
aspirations of making the varsity,” said Franke add-
ing, ‘‘it allows them to develop their tennis skills and
gain experience to help them.”’ Realistically, Franke
said, many of the JVers may not make the team, but
will still have the opportunity to participate in inter-
collegiate athletics.

The newest addition to the JV family is the JV foot-
ball team. The concept of a JV football program has
been reborn under the leadership of varsity coach
Gary Fallon. Fallon feels there is a definite need for a
JV program at W&L. ‘‘We have 72 players on the var-
sity team, including 38 freshmen. It isn’t possible to
get everyone into the game,” explained Fallon.

Fallon said the JV program will allow those on the
varsity squad who are not playing to work on their in-
dividual skills and keep interested in the program. In
addition to the second and third stringers on the varsi-
ty, the JV team includes 15 W&L students who were
not playing football before. In all, about 50 players
will comprise the JV football team. Pallon said that
he hopes to make the varsity a junior and senior
oriented team and let the freshmen work their way up
through the system. The JV schedule already in-
cludes three games in October and Fallon hopes to
add two or three more games. The games will be
played on Monday afternoons so the varsity coaches
can observe the younger players and so those varsity
players also playing for the JV will have four days to
prepare for the following week’s varsity game.

Not only are the JV teams beneficial to their varsity
programs, buy they are also beneficial to the W&L
student body. They allow for increased participation
in intercollegiate sports. More students can get in-
volved in these sports and gain experience in playing
a sport they’re not familiar with such as soccer,
lacrosse or water polo.

JV sports also fit in very well with W&L’s
philosophy on athletics. Athletics are here for the
students. Not everyone is good enough to play on a
varsity team. And not everyone wants to participate
in sports on the competitive level of a varsity pro-
gram. |

Although each coach has his own philosophy of what
a JV program should be and include, the programs
are here for the students. Intercollegiate athletics can
be a very enjoyable and fulfilling experience. So if
you can squeeze it in between homework and frat par-
ties, a JV sport could be for you. Remember, many a
star athlete started out on a JV team.

First year W&L swimming
and water polo coach Page
Remillard has recently been ap-
pointed to the NCAA Swimming
Committee. This committee is
responsible for overseeing rule
changes, validating records,
and developing policy for na-
tional championship meets.
Remillard becomes one of three
Division III representatives on
the twelve man committee. .

The NCAA sponsors an an-
nual meeting of this committee
each spring. During the two-
and-a-half day meeting, the
committee discusses the rules
of swimming and of the cham-
pionships. The three Division
III members also attend the
division championships each
year.

‘I was very pleased and sur-
prised at being appointed,”
commented Remillard, ‘‘and I

. am looking forward to working.

with the national body of swim-
ming.” Remillard is impressed
with the high caliber of coaches
and swimming experts with
whom he will be working on the
committee.

Remillard’s qualifications for
the appointment are extensive.
His administrative experience
includes service on the NCAA
Games Committee for the Na-
tional Water Polo Champion-
ships in 1977 and service on the
NCAA Division III National

Championship Meet Committee
for swimming in 1978.
Remillard’s coaching record
was no doubt partially responsi-
ble for his appointment. In
three years cf coaching at
Claremont Men’s-Harvey Mudd
Colleges, he coached 21 All-
American swimmers, and twice
finished in the national ‘‘top 10”’
in Division III. In his last year
at the California school, his
swimming team was fifth in the

Fishing
For Bass

by Jim Feinman
Barring another tropical
depression, some of the best

smallmouth bass fishing of the

year will be available to anglers
in the area.

The James River around
Natural Bridge yielded some
excellent catches at the end of
the past week. The water level
was low and clear and the
cooler weather made the bass
eager to strike. Some of the hot
baits were Mepps spinners and
balsawood minnow imitations.

By the middle of this week,
the streams should have reced-
ed to a fishable level following
the weekend’s deluge. The
Maury River will be a good spot
from Goshen all the way to
Buena Vista. The Maury is easi-
ly wadeable in low water as
compared to the James, which
is best fished from a canoe. The
James is a large river with deep
holes and strong currents. Only
experienced boaters should
voyage out on it.

Some of the smaller streams
in the area, such as Buffalo
Creek, will also provide good
fishing for bass. in the next cou-
ple of weeks. These streams are
perfect for the solo angler who
desires an hour or two of fishing
in the afternoon.

Light spinning tackle with 4-6
test line is adequate for the
Maury and the smaller
streams. Anglers on the James
might need 6-12 test line as
several large muskies are taken
from the river each year in the
fall.

Spinners and medium depth
lures will provide good action in
most areas. Live bait, especial-
ly sculpins and _ hellgramites,
can be deadly at times on the
smallmouth.

kk

George Irvine reports little
success on the doves during the
past week. ‘‘I was out there all
day Saturday and didn’t see a
bird. I even shucked corn for
‘em but they wouldn’t come in,”
said Irvine.

Edward Morrison, an avid
amateur ornithologist, reports
that the fall migration of many
species of birds will begin soon.
Morrison is on the lookout for
ospreys, great blue herons,
green herons, and many species
of hawks. Morrison made at
least one siting of all these
migratory birds last fall in the
vicinity of his Buffalo Creek
home.

ming Committee

nation and his water polo teams
won their conference champion-
ship.

An appointment to the NCAA
Swimming Committee is an
honor for any swimming coach,
but it is especially impressive in
Remillard’s case. To have
achieved this level of national
recognition in only his fourth
year of coaching at the college
level speaks highly of
Remillard’s coaching talents.
 

Netmen To Play
in Navy Tourney

by Frank Jackman

If past performances are any
indication of things to come,
Washington & Lee tennis fans
have a great deal to look for-
ward to this spring. The tennis
team has started fall practice
and the entire squad has return-
ed from last year’s highly suc-
cessful season.

Last spring, the Generals
totally dominated the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference
finishing fourth nationally in
the NCAA Division III national
tournament.

Leading the team this year
are co-captains Dave Constine
and All-American Stewart
Jackson. Also returning from
last year’s squad are Robert
Schuler, Wes Yonge, Pat Nor-
ris, Doug Gaker and Sumner
Bouldin.

Fall tennis is designed
primarily as a team tryout for
spring. Over the next few weeks
there will be challenge matches
to decide positions on the roster.
Among those challenging are
eight promising freshmen who
hope to give the upperclass
players a tough time.

In addition to the practice
calendar, the team plays a
rigorous fall tournament
schedule. During the fall, the
Generals travel to Annapolis to
compete in the Navy tourna-
ment against seven other
schools from this part of the

country.

Following that, the Generals
play in the Quadrangular
James Madison Tournament
against James Madison, Rich-
mond and George Mason
University. But without a doubt,
the highlight of the fall schedule
will be the annual Washington &
Lee Invitational Tournament
scheduled for October 14-15.

When the Generals open
camp in the spring, they will
face what is reputed to be one of
the most difficult Division Il
schedules.

With 24 matches during the
regular season, the stiffest com-
petition should come from the
University of North Carolina.
Also, during the spring break,
the Generals will head south to
Florida to face some of the stif-
fest competition in that area.

Even at this early stage,
Coach Franke has set forth
three objectives: first ‘to im-
prove on last year’s fourth
place finish at the NCAA na-
tional tournament; secondly, to
defeat the toughest competition
possible; and finally, to again
dominate the ODAC for the
fourth consecutive year.

Coach Franke appears confi-
dent about both the fall and spr-
ing seasons. With the quality of
players on the squad this year,

it could prove to be the
Generals’ most successful
season yet.

CC Team Wins

by Greg Branan

Despite running on an im-
provised five-mile course, the
Washington and Lee cross coun-
try team opened its 1979 season
with victories over Davis and
Elkins and Mary Washington in
last Saturday's tri-meet. Parts
of W&L’s regular course were
impassable due to the rain.

Coach Dick Miller was ‘‘very
pleased” with the team's show-
ing at this point in the season.
The final score was W&L-30,
D&E-33, and Mary
Washington-73.

Football,

Tennis
Begin
In IMs

by Chris Sisto

Intramural sports for the
1979-80 season began this past
week as both football and tennis
kicked off their schedules with a
full slate of games Monday.
Both sports will run until Oc-
tober 11 with the finals con-
cluding October 18.

The entire intramural pro-
gram at Washington and Lee is
under the direction of Verne
Canfield and senior Joe Olive.
Accorto Olive, “I do the
organizing and the busy work
while Coach Canfield makes
sure the job gets done. He is full
control and has the final say in
all matters.”’

Olive expressed that he had
only minimal problems in get-
ting the season underway. The
only two problems that exist are
in football.

First, there is not enough
space to play the games. Olive
explained, ‘‘We have two teams
more than we had last year and
the use of two less fields, which
is making the organizing a little
more hectic.’’ The second pro-
blem is a lack of referees. Olive
urges anyone who is interested
in being a referee and earning
some extra money to contact
him at the IM office, ext. 154.

Other than those two pro-
blems, Olive said the rest of the
program is running smoothly.
There are no rule changes in
either sport this season nor are
there any major organizational
differences. Both sports have
three divisions with 17 teams
competing in football and 19
playing tennis. Eight teams will
make the playoffs in each sport.

In football, last year's cham-
pion SAE has already lost its
opener to Beta, 8-6. In tennis,
the defending champion is Law
3.

“REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr:

Economics 101

Although we have not received any official com-

plaints from the faculty or administration, we have

heard distant rumblings from the direction of The Hill
about an advertisement we ran last week for
‘Research Papers.’’ Now, everyone knows that
‘Research Papers”’ can be purchased and submitted
by a deceitful student as his own work—that’s called
plagiarism, and plagiarism is a violation of the honor
code.

So why did we run an ad advertising plagiarism?
Well, for the money of course. Unfortunately, for all
the high-minded, idealistic purposes behind
publishing a newspaper, it takes money to ‘‘serve the
interests of a free and democratic society.”

We were hit by a hefty increase in our publishing
costs this year which will necessarily expand our
budget by $7,000 if we want to put out a newspaper of
any size and quality. Since the Executive Committee
has not yet held its budget hearings and since we are
not at all sure the student government will be willing
to help us make up this awesome amount, we have to
rely on advertising to make up our increased printing
costs. Our advertising lineage for the first two issues
is actually lower than last year, however.

Besides, we put a disclaimer above the ad advising
interested students that use of the advertised
material would be at their own risk. If Washington
and Lee’s Honor System is as strong as we are told it
is, all of the University’s students will ignore the ad
while we still collect our money. We are also remind-
ed of the story about the student who bought such a

paper and turned it in as his own: the professor com- .

mented, ‘‘This is an excellent paper; it was also an
excellent paper when I wrote it 20 years ago.”’ Of
course if some generous benefactor were to give us
the money to make up for our increased costs, then we
would be in a position to turn away such ‘‘dirty
revenue’’ in the future.

Creative Writing

Our campus is one of the most beautiful in the coun-
try and we believe this can be attributed to the pride
the students take in the school’s appearance. Many of
the larger State schools and less respected private in-
stitutions cannot make this claim as they enroll an
element of undesirables who express themselves in
socially unacceptable forms—we’re referring to
spray-painted graffiti.

In the past four years there has never been an inci-
dent we’ve seen of spray-painted graffiti written with
the intent of communicating disparaging sentiments
toward another fraternity. Such communiques can be
seen on the footbridge and on many of the steps of the
State school to the northeast. W&L gentlemen have
always been above such sophomoric pranks, at least
until Saturday night.

We doubt the student body will tolerate such
behavior. It is unfortunate that an element exists
among us who can only communicate with such a
base form of expression. We have only seen a small
incident, but we hope that unlike so many of the
behaviorisms admired by the lemmings among us
who can only function by conforming to the pack, this
one act of social irresponsibility will be the last of its
kind. We'd hate to see the Colonnade look like a sub-
way station.

Editor:

There is a movement afoot in
the SAB to move the Fancy
Dress Ball from the Student
Center to the gymnasium. As
advisor to’ the SAB Michael
Cappeto stated, the crowds at
Fancy Dress have become so
big that we are facing a poten-
tial fire hazard. The crowd last
year was nearly twice the legal
limit.

From a fatalist’s point of
view, whether 3,500 or 5,500 go
to the Ball, everyone will go up
in smoke should there be a fire.
Suppose all 3,500 manage to
squeeze in the Dining Hall to
watch an encore performance
by Beau Dudley. Hypothetical, |
realize, but so is a fire. Never-
theless, we face a tough deci-
sion,

What the issue boils down to is
the privilege of alumni to attend
Fancy Dress. Of the 5,000 who
came last year, alumni ac-
counted for 1,200 (including
dates). Thus, the alternatives
seem to be, as stated in the last
SAB meeting, either to
eliminate the carte blanche
privilege of allowing alumni to
come to Fancy Dress or to hold
Fancy Dress in a place that
would accomodate everyone,
like the gymnasium or even
Zollman’s for that matter.

First of all, the notion of put-
ting a first class gala event in
the gym would be an anomaly.
No matter how extensive the

To The Editor

Fancy Dress Complications

decorations are, the gym is still
going to look like a gym. The
idea of walking down a flight of
stairs to the training room, a la
Studio 54, strikes me as
distasteful.

There is no way the gym can
undergo the total and complete
transformation that we have
come to expect in recent years

in the Student Center. As a
veteran of Fancy Dress Work
Week and former chairman of
the Paper Cutting Committee, |
can tell you that the easiest
thing to do in the world is to cut
paper and tack it on a wall. But
there’s more to Fancy Dress
decorations than that. There is
the special attention to detail.

(continued on page 2)

Persiflage
Success With Women

Let's face it. To be ‘‘successful’’ with women, while at W&L, re-
quires more than a clean button-down shirt or massive quantities of
alcohol. The old ‘‘get ‘em wasted” scheme might get you a few
blurry experiences with some pock-marked blimps, but it is hardly
going to earn you that desired ‘‘stud” label. _

To really rack up the notches on your belt you have to be utterly
unscrupulous. Forget that you are dealing with people. Your air is
to maximize pleasure while minimizing the subtle effects of the
warped female mentality.

Too many guys make the mistake of chasing the whole field at
once. This strategy might pay off in the short run, but even future
homemakers of America can figure out that they are being two-
timed. A much better approach, one that has consistently scored
high marks on the long term pleasure scale, is lying.

Now lots of people lie to get what they want, but they go about it
haphazardly. I’m advocating a calculated scheme of organized
deception.

First, you supply your target with enough sentiment so that it
becomes easy for her to rationalize her future downfall. Then, you
set out endearing yourself with her friends. Impress them with
your loyalty and sincerity.

After a carefully orchestrated break-up, in which the “callous
vamp” throws you to the wayside, these friends supply vou witha
new base from which to work. They'll be glad to connive against
their ex-friend in their attempts to avoid becoming secretaries with
a good background in art history.

Now is that difficult?

Taking Issue With John Warner

Prominent alumni can play a
large part in enhancing the
reputation of a _ school.
However, after reaching
former Secretary of the Navy
John Warner’s little torpedo in
the premier issue of Shenan-
doah Valley Magazine entitled
‘“‘My College Days at
Washington and Lee,’’ one
almost wonders if the Senator,
presently a member of the
Board of Trustees, is a friend or
foe of his alma mater.

Half of Warner’s article is
dedicated to prasing ‘‘The spirit
of W&L.”’ Washington and Lee’s
code of gentlemen’ and
‘‘Washington and Lee, its cam-
pus and principles.” The rest of
the article is a_ self-serving
tribute to Warner's derelec-
titude as a W&L student, his
subsequent generosity, and his
grave misunderstanding of
what W&L is and what it can be.

Says Warner, ‘‘Washington
and Lee's code of gentlemen the
honor code, and the heritage otf
the school have guided me all
my adult life.”’ Let's deal with
these three issues one at a time.

Warner claims allegience to
the “Code of Gentlemen,” yet
he finds it curious that he has
been invited back to Hollins,
Sweet Briar, Mary Baldwin,
and Lynchburg College on
speaking engagements, He at-
tributes these invites to the fact
that these schools have either
“forgotton or forgiven. (his)
deportment as a W&L student.
Great recruiting tool, that state
ment. Anything that needs to be

forgotten or forgiven couldn't
have been too gentlemanly.

Warner claims to be big on
the Honor Code, yet he boasts of
making 50 cents a night ‘‘sleep-
ing in’ at VMI, filling the beds
of wayward Cadets. Though this
isn't exactly lying, cheating or
stealing, it ain’t real above
board either. But perhaps the
Honor Code stops at the proper-
ty line.

More disturbing, though, than
these triffles, more disturbing
than Warner's espousal, the
work hard-play hard myth, and
even more disturbing than a
prose style which suggests that
Warner never saw the inside of
Payne Hall, is his utter
misunderstnading of the great
potential of Washington and
Lee, a potential based upon its
rich heritage.

Warner's sole mention of
academics is a_ passing
reference to the well-worn work
hard-play hard fantasy. He
could have mentioned a few of
W&L’s truly great men, nor like
James Leyburn who emphasiz-
ed their commitment to the in-
tellect, to honor, and to the
gentlemanly ideal by quietly
living it.

Instead, using the voice that
he and only a few others can at
ford, Warner proposes a tradi
tion rich in heros like “jabbo

I'm sure the prospeets of tin-

know a man a home, a promi-
nent law professor, who, when
he discovered that I went to
W&L, couldn't wait to tell me
about one of his fondest
memories of the school.

Every homecoming and Fan-
cy Dress his fraternity would
buy an old piano, hoist it three
stories with a rope and pully on-
ly to drop it, to listen to the ping
of the breaking strings. Then, of
course, to make sure that all the
strings pinged, they would set
the piano ablaze.

And lest we forget, these
masters of the framing were
around during the hey day of
big time W&L football. Gator
Bowl and all that. And now
these fellows are all reformed
piano torchers looking tor tax
deductions to deserve to be (ex-
pect to be?) entertained on
alumni Saturday afternoons at
old Wilson Field, scene of their
former glory. If W&L’s_ big
budget football program isn't

aestretaully pleasing it is at
least cost effective in the long
run

With alumni like that as
salesmen tor the school can we
honestly wonder why a few
fraternities have a little trouble
with late night noise

What Is Wrong With The Ring-tum Phi?

I Man Committee Assails Phi

EC Pres Blasts Newspaper

Dear Students,

Every year I have anxiously awaited the
printing of the Ring-tum Phi in hopes that
the new year will provide accurate repor-
ting of the important events on campus. I
have been disillusioned each year, and
alas, this year is no exception.

After reading the Phi’s article on the
new honor trial, I was disappointed to find
it misleading and frankly incorrect in
parts. If the Ring-tum Phi is to be the
Washington and Lee community’s paper,
then_it should concentrate on accuracy
rather than controversy.

First, Randy Smith, this year’s editor,
misconstrued my statement concerning
the extension of a request for a public trial.
The statement in no way attempts to com-
ment on a student’s ability to receive a se-
cond honor hearing as Mr. Smith implied. I
merely attempted to clear up an earlier
problem the Phi had in understanding the
situation.

Previously, the Phi had claimed that the
granting of an extension of the 24 hour time
period was unprecedented. This is simply
not true. I quoted from the White Book in
an effort to inform the student body that
last year’s E.C. had not overstepped its
bounds in this matter. Last year’s E.C.
gave the accused an extension of the 24
hour time period, which is in perfect ac-
cordance with White Book procedure. My
statement in no way attempted to com-
ment on our granting the accused a private
trial, as Mr. Smith stated.

Secondly, Mr. Smith said, ‘‘the situation
for granting a second private honor trial
was still unclear.”” Mr. Smith seemingly
did not digest the entire statement issued
because the initial paragraph dealt with

t ) Ring 7um Phi

 

 

 

 

 

the granting of the second honor trial. As I

‘quoted from the White Book: ‘‘A hearing

may be reopened upon the production of
new evidence directly bearing on the ques-
tion of guilt or innocence or to prevent in-
justices.” (Article L, p. 8).

Thirdly, the Ring-tum Phi claimed that

“the non-suit papers had been drawn up
for several weeks.”’ Although this is cor-
rect, Mr. Smith’s use of the word
‘“however’’ cast doubt onto my statement
that the suit was still pending. As of the
printing of the article, the suit was still ac-
tive.
- Finally, Mr. Smith stated that I ‘“‘would
not answer any further questions about the
case.”’ This is a total misrepresentation of
the facts, as anyone who was there will at-
test. I answered each and every question
directed to me. When no further questions
were asked, the meeting was adjourned.
Obviously, what actually occured is quite
different from what was reported.

I write this not to instigate a Phi-E.C.
conflict, but to inform the Washington and
Lee community about the actions of its
elected officials so that they will see this
situation in the proper light.

Sincerely,
Stephen H. Abraham
Student Body President

Editor's Note: The Ring-tum Phi regrets the
implication in last week’s EC story that no
further questions were answered when, in
fact, no other questions were asked.

We otherwise stand behind the story as
written.

Student Upset With EC

Dear Editor:

An incident occurred at the Executive
Committee meeting Monday night that
distressed me considerably.

Steve Abraham disclosed that Nor-
thcross High School in Roanoke had re-
quested a member of the E.C. to speak to
its student body on the importance of the

laugh, prompting laughter from one end of
the table to the other, and commented,
“Bag that.”

After the laughter had died down,
Abraham asked if any member of the com-
mittee did not have class before 10:30 a.m.
on Friday, as Northcross was going to hold
its assembly at 8:45 that morning. Mr.
Fraser, the third year law school represen-
tative replied that he did not. Abraham
asked if he would like to give the talk to
which Fraser replied, ‘‘No.’’ As an after
thought Fraser added, ‘‘I don’t think I’m

Dear Editor:

In my opinion, your second editorial of
the year had useful insight into the break-
in case. Likewise, many of the Phi’s new
articles have been clear and thorough.
However, so far, at least part of the Phi’s
content has been harmful, in bad taste, or
at least trivial A newspaperman’s
freedom to print what he likes, especially
in a student-owned paper, does not justify
uninhibited or unthoughtful _ self-
expression.

First, it is reprehensible for the Phi to
advertise for the sale of a ready-made
term papers (page 8, September 20). The
advertisement encourages violations of
the Honor Code, plain and simple. Respect
for the Honor Code is the thread of unity
which runs through, or should run through,
every aspect of Washington and Lee.

Second, there is no justification for
slandering local women’s colleges (‘‘A

 

Freshman’s Guide’). The Phi represents
all W&L students to the public, and should
consider the effect of articles on students’
reputations, especially when the articles
are unsigned.

Third, triviality makes poor reading.
Please reduce the number of pages in the
Phi, rather than ‘“‘filling’’ with trivia.
Photos with “‘isn’t-that-cute”’ captions and
the extraordinarily limp ‘‘Persiflage”’
would be grateful candidates for omission.

These opinions come from a committee
of one and are certainly subjective.
However, I think most students would
agree that the Phi must continually recon-
sider the content of the paper, in light of its
responsibility to the W&L community.
Then the editors can confidently begin to
sign their articles.

Sincerely
Andrew Trotter

 

 

Sweet Briar Student Blasts Phi

Dear Editor

I have more than a few words to say in
response to “A Freshmans’ Guide to sur-
rounding Girl’s Schools’’—a profile of
Sweet Briar College (Sept. 13) written by
some (naturally) anonymous journalist.

To begin with, in any type of profile, I
feel that it is necessary to have an UN-
BIASED opinion in the mind of the author.
It seems to me that this particular writer
has had some out-of-the-ordinary en-
counters with our security force, as that is
what he spent two-thirds of his article talk-
ing about.

Granted, our security system has
become stricter since last year, but did the
author ever stop to wonder why? Obvious-
ly some need for additional control must
have presented itself. This need stems
from the amount of unwanted trespassers
(hence, the reason you are questioned at
the gate) invading our grounds, and even
more so, from the perpetual damage in-
curred last year from too many unacciden-
tal ‘“‘accidents”’ (such as throwing a 30 lb.
cement receptacle through dorm win-
dows). Personally, I agree with the addi-
tional control, as the money to cover such
damages comes out of my _ pocket
whenever the so-called ‘‘man’’ fails to
report himself and own up to his respon-
sibility.

Furthermore, the writer also seemed
somewhat insulted that the security of-
ficers (which, by the way, are no longer

“rent-a-cops,”’ if you don’t mind) did not
take to ‘‘a lot of lip, or a swing in their
general direction.”’ This to me is appall-
ing. The least favorite aspect of a security
officer’s duties is the role of a
disciplinarian. Why ‘must the writer and
others further burden this duty hy harass-
ing the officers and generally making a
fool of themselves? Does this habit prove
one’s manliness or something? I’ve yet to
figure it out.

Moreover, the writer mentions that
there is a lack of women at Boathouse par-
ties. Did he ever stop to think the reason
behind it may be that there are few girls
who would want to attend the same party
as a guy with his kind of attitude? Most of
the guys I know at W&L do not share his at-
titude, but of the ones I know that do, I, too,
find my books more interesting.

Another point: I found it rather peculiar
that the author feels a ‘‘meaningful rela-
tionship” can only be established after
‘“‘pumpkin-time.”’

I happened to show a copy of the
aforementioned article to a freshman at
W&L on his first visit to SBC—which, by
the way, he had not previously read. He
stated that he had no problems with securi-
ty and found the women here to be quite
nice. After reading the article he said he
probably would not have visited our school
if he had read the article beforehand. Isn’t

Warner

(continued from page 10)

One might suggest that a part
of this dilemma is due to the
fact that many of the men who
are now becoming successful
are significant alumni are men
who attended W&L in the late
40’s and early 50’s as veterans
of WW II and were thus a little
wilder than your basic 18-year-
old freshman. There even is a
precedent for this phenomonen.

Quoting Henry Ruffner, a pro-
fessor and _ president of
Washington College, from the
recently published history of
Liberty Hall Academy, speak-
ing about Revolutionary War
veterans who enrolled in the
academy:

‘Many of these young men of
the fields and woods had been
taken away to camps and towns
where depraved manners grew
familiar to their eyes and cor-
rupted their hearts. They on
their return home too easily
communicated their acquired
knowledge of evil to their young

contemporaries... The number
of those who studied amuse-
ment and roguery was so great
as to make the teachers office
exceedingly irksome _ and
discouraging.”

But the number of men who
recognized and seized the in-
tellectual opportunities offered
by W&L suggests that an inflex
of veterans is far too simplistic
an explanation for the problems
illustrated by a perception of
W&L such as that articulated by
Warner.

A large measure of what
could be termed an identity
crisis stems from an imperfect
understanding of W&L’s
heritage and tradition.

Senator Warner and many
others trumpet the honor code
and the ideal of the gentleman
while bragging about exploits
which run counter to both.
Though their lip service seems
to be their only service to these
high ideals, they feel that they
have somehow topped into the

W&L tradition.

Thus connected in some
mythical way to the school, they
vow to maintain the great tradi-
tions of which they are a past.
Warner’s goal as a Trustee is
“to preserve Washington and
Lee as (he) knew it and as (his)
father knew it.”

A key aspect of his preserva-
tion effort is a commitment to
keep W&L all male. Other in-
stances of ‘‘traditionalism”’ at
W&L are numerous and ob-
vious.

But the maintenance of these
aspects, these superficial
“‘traditions,”’ the work hard-
play hard myth, the exagerated
role of fraternities and other
social indicators are not at the
heart of the Washington & Lee
tradition.

“Strict constructionalists”’
like Warner are too busy mak-
ing sure the buildings stay red
and white and the student body
stays all male, to understand
the heritage of men like William
Graham and Robert E. Lee.

The five years of Lee’s
presidency are five of the most
vibrant years in the school’s
history. Lee established the
first school of journalism in the
country, one of the first
business departments in the
country, and generally turned
the curriculum upside down—
reshaping it to serve the needs
of the day.

The tradition of Lee is one of
experimentation and innova-
tion, one of excitement and
change. Based upon the legacy
of Lee, W&L should have been
one of the first schools in the
country to become co- educa-
tional, not doomed to be one of
the last. Old Robert E. is pro-
bably in his crypt, in his chapel,
spinning like a dervish over
what the school named after
him has done in the name of
tradition.

It is said that Lee’s father,
Light Horse Harry, was pro-
bably influential in helping

George Washington decide to
donote his 100 shares in the
James River Company to the
then Liberty Hall Academy in

1796. Just think what W&L

would be like today if Lee had
thought like John Warner and
had tried to preserve the school
his father knew.

We’d all be out of Mulberry
Hill and the triuium and the
quadrivium would seem like a
major educational break
through.

What I’m trying to say is that
W&L is far too good a school to
be trivialized and misinter-
preted by Mr. Warner’s drivel.
And it has far too much poten-
tial as an educational institution
to be encyained by a limited no-
tion of tradition which im-
mortalizes piano stoked bon
fires and Jabbo the beer man
while it makes ‘‘honor’’,
“education’’, and ‘‘gentleman”’
to pass’’ words to mouth, but
not ideals to live by.

qualified.’ Abraham ended the discussion
by saying, ‘‘We’ll call ‘em back and tell
them we can’t make it this time.”

My complaint is threefold. First, I think
Mr. Abraham’s conduct was inexcusable.
His attitude will set the tone for every
issue the E.C. addresses itself to this year.
I realize that an E.C. meeting need not be a
strictly formal affair, but I hope Abraham
will use better judgment in the future in
deciding what is serious and what is not.

My second complaint concerns Mr.
Fraser’s after thought. I am assuming that
as a third year law student Mr. Fraser is
an adequate public speaker, therefore, he
meant he was not qualified to speak on the
particular subject. In the course of the
year, if not already, Fraser will be respon-
sible to pass judgment in many honor
trials. If Fraser is not familiar with the im-
portance of the Honor Code, is he then
qualified to judge an honor trial?

Third, I think the Executive Committee
is responsible to represent the student
body in all respects. Failing to send a
speaker was not only rude but stupid. The
E.C. missed an excellent opportunity to
enhance Washington and Lee’s image out-
side of the community. Opportunities such

as this do not occur often. If the opportuni-

ty arises again I strongly urge the Ex-
ecutive Committee to take advantage of it.

it a shame that the misrepresentation of
Sweet Briar College in your newspaper
may cut out one-fifth of the area’s women
from your other freshman?

I am very proud to attend this college
and to see it so grotesquely portrayed
hurts me deeply. Especially when this por-
trayal was written by a student from a
school I admire. Sweet Briar College has a
great deal more to offer than an effective
security force and crowded parties. I feel
that if the editor cannot choose a journalist
who will report an assignment of this sort
without bias then he should eliminate the
article altogether. Thank you for the op-

portunity to air my views.
