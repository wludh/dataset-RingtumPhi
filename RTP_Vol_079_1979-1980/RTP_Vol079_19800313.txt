cGevern Speaks Out

Washington and Lee University

 

On Current Issues

By Marc Birenbaum
Speaking Thursday night as
the Contact symposium’s lec-
turer, Sen. George S. McGovern
related recent U.S. foreign
policy developments to the
following:

The Future of SALT — ‘‘We
should not fall into the trap of
thinking that the SALT treaty is
a reward for good behavior on
the part of the Soviet Union or
that withdrawing of it is
something of a punishment to
the Soviet Union. We should
have no interest in the SALT
treaty at all unless it is in dur in-
terest.”

On this year’s presidential
race — ‘‘Once again, two rather
small and minor countries,
judged by any standard of
military or economic power,
have come to dominate the
presidential debates.”

On Iran and Afghanistan — ‘‘I
would argue that there is very
little relevance between the
combat readiness of the
American army, the American
navy, the American air force
and in what took place either. in
Iran or Afghanistan. I would
also argue that it would be a
mistake to assume here tonight
that the Soviet troops in
Afghanistan are heading for the
oil in the Persian Gulf.”

Concerning America’s
military strength — ‘‘Does that
mean that because. they have
50,000, 60,000, or even 100,000

Soviet troops in Afghanistan
that the Soviet Union is stronger
tonight and that the United
States is weaker than we were
six months ago? I don’t believe
that. It may just be the opposite
They have stumbled into a can
of worms that has actually
weakened the Soviet Union.”
The South Dakota senator said
he has heard intelligence
reports the Soviets are receiv-
ing up to 250 casualties a day.

NUMBER 22

EC To Give Monthly Reports

Discusses Nationwide Grade Inflation

by John Billmyre

After deadlocking 6-6 on a mo-
tion that would have required it
to make a fourth report each
year summarizing its financial
transactions, the Executive
Committee passed another mo-
tion that requires it to report
monthly.

The first proposal came dur-
ing Monday’s meeting and was
brought up by Business
Manager John Hamilton and
Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Kevin McGowan.

Their proposal said the EC
should report four times a year,
in September, January, April
and May.

But EC President Steve
Abraham said the EC is already
required to make three of the
recommended reports, with the
April report being the only addi-
tion.

Abraham added that the EC
was supposed to make a finan-
cial report in January, but
neglected to do so. He said the
January report will be made at
the next EC meeting, Monday
night.

The EC President questioned
the intent behind the motion,
but said, “It would be a good
thing for the student body to
know what the EC is costing
them.”

EC Secretary Cove Geary
supported Abraham, but Senior
Law Representative John
Fraser asked Hamilton and
McGowan how the motion

would help them, since they
proposed it.

They replied that knowing the
EC’s printing costs would help
them gage their printing costs.

After the first motion stalled
and died, the second motion, for
monthly reports, was proposed.

Fraser supported the second
motion, ‘‘so people can check on
what we are doing.”’

He said the concept for mon-
thly reports is the same as open
meetings. ‘‘Once we get in the
habit of making monthly
reports, it will be easy,” said
Fraser.

Abraham also brought up
what he called a ‘‘nation-wide
problem of grade inflation.”

The average grade point
average at W&L is 2.65, but the
national average is between 3.0
and 3.2 said Abraham.

After discussing the situation,
the EC made a recommenda-
tion that students be given the
option of including their class
rank with transcripts.

To make the option obvious to
all students, the EC recom-
mended the registrar put a box
on all transcripts, which can be
filled in if students want their
class rank included with grades
and transcripts.

The recommendation was
unanimous.

The EC also chose three new
members for the Student
Emergency Loan Committee.

David Cook, Frank Eppes and
Eric Kolts were selected to sit

on the SELC, to replace the two
Student Control Represen-
tatives and fill the slot for one
student member from the stu-
dent body.

The EC heard reports from
subcommittees during the re-
mainder of Monday’s meeting.

Contact reported it has about
$4,500 left for this year.

Co-Chairman Channing Hall
said Contact plans to have Tom
Wolfe, a W&L alumnus and
author of several books, speak
on the Thursday of Mock Con-
vention.

Hall also said Contact might
sponsor one more speaker, who
has not yet been selected.

Senior EC Representative
Jay Blumberg asked Hall why it
cost $61 for Senator George
McGovern’s dinner.

Hall said three Contact
members and Dr. Barry
Machado took McGovern out to
dinner and added McGovern
ordered drinks.

The EC also wanted to know
why Machado went along for
the dinner.

Hall explained that faculty
members do not always go out
to dinner with the speaker, but
Machado is an “expert” in
American diplomacy.

The Mock Convention made
its monthly report and
answered questions from the
EC about funds and Jim Hicks’
status with the Steering Com-
mittee.

Big Three, IFC Elections Decided

Bob Willis will be the next
Student Body President and
Willy Mackie will be the next
Vice President.

Neither victory in elections
Monday came as a surprise
since both candidates ran unop-
posed.

Bud White won the Secretary
position over write-in can-
didates Robert Neely and Dan
Weiss. White received 397 votes
to Neely’s 163 and Weiss’s 109.

In the Interfraternity Council
elections, Pi Kappa Alpha
Monte Briscoe defeated Phi
Kappa Sigma Rob Brooke,
304-225.

Phi Kappa Psi Chip Nunley
won the Vice President spot,
defeating Kappa Alpha John
Northington and Delta Tau
Delta Hall Vetterlein.

The elections went smoothly,
but the Executive Committee

discussed what did and did not
constitute a valid ballot.

After discussing the issue, the
EC passed a motion that only
ballots indicating a perference
for a student be counted as a
valid ballot.

The EC amendment that the
student body reserve fund be
raised to $4,000 from $2,500, was
defeated.

 

Petitions for rising
sophomore, junior and senior
EC representative are due Mon-
day. There will also be a rule-

    

Willy Mackie
setting session at that meeting
which all candidates must at-
tend.

Candidates who want to run
for EC positions should attend
the meeting and bring a

   

petititon with 50 signatures.

The election will be held on
March 24.

Petitions for Law School
Representatives are due March
24, when there will be a rule-
setting meeting.

Elections for the law school
will be held the following Mon-
day.

The Selling Of The Party 1980

by Marc Birenbaum

Believe or not, there was a
time when political commer-
cials were simple, cut and dry
advertisements — a speech to a
special interest group, an at-
tack on a supposed weakness of
an opponent or an ad depicting
your favorite candidate as the
All-American all supporters
truly knew him or her to be.

Then came the advent of the
presidential contender’s media
blitz, described so well in books
like The Selling of The Presi-
dent, 1968, The People Machine,
The Image Candidates and The
Political Persuaders.

Even this year’s campaign
showed brief glimpses of a good
candidate commercial. Sen.
Howard Baker produced one of

Student Offers
‘Alibi Service’

An enterprising college stu-
dent at the University of
Arizona has come up with a
unique way to make a living: an
“Alibi Service’ for those
female college students who
don’t want their parents to
know they have moved in with
their boyfriends.

Lisa, a 22-year-old student,
makes her service available for
$20 a month. For that sum, she
will take unexpected telephone
calls from unsuspecting
parents, receive mail and
deliver messages to her clients.
She will also play the part of
roommate in case the parents
pay an unexpected visit.

Defense Plans
For Laser Gun

The 2ist century may already
be upon us, in term of futuristic
warfare.

The Defense Department is
planning to issue a contract
next month for construction of
its High Energy Laser System
Test Facility at White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico.
The Pentagon has already spent
$2 billion in developing and
testing the application of laser
light for attacking tanks, air-
craft, missiles, and orbiting
satellites, the New York Times
reported this week.

A powerful beam of laser
light could destroy a target

partly by the heat it generates
and partly by the shock wave
the sudden heat would cause in
the target. A laser beam
demonstrated in 1978 by a
California technology company

 

the most effective and con-
troversial commercials, when
he responded to an Iranian’s
question while stumping in
Iowa. When George Bush was
interviewed on ‘‘Sixty
Minutes,” his campaign was
caught in an embarassing situa-
tion when the CBS crew filmed
Bush’s people re-enacting a
welcoming party at a New
England airport.

Now the Republican party
itself is sinking $5 million in an
ad campaign with the general
theme: ‘Vote Republican. For
a change.’’ — a theme reminis-
cient of the 1946 campaign in
which the GOP captured both
chambers of Congress.

What makes this campaign so
unique is that it seeks to provide

Briefs —

successful shot down a missile.

One drawback to the new
weapon might be the cost. One
estimate has placed the cost of
shooting down an _ incoming
ballistic missile with a single
pulse of energy at $1.5 million.
But the Pentagon is still moving
ahead with the project and is
considering placing the new
weapon in outer space, where
intercontinental missiles would
be easier to destroy.

More DOE
Waste Projects

Here are some more ex-
amples of how the Department
of Energy dispenses with the
$56 million available for energy
research grants, according to
an internal DOE memo on the
subject.

One million dollars went to a
Northwest Mississippi Junior
College for a ‘‘Total Solar Con-
version System.’’ That scien-
tific sounding project was real-
ly a wood-burning heating plant
for the college, but was not in-
vestigated before the grant was
given.

DOE investigators said the
system “‘is not intended to ad-
vance the state of the art’’ and
also found that no one at DOE
was overseeing how the money
was being spent.

The University of Missouri
was given $830,000 to study ex-

tracting gasses from wood. |

DOE asked eight scientists to
evaluate the project, but six of
the eight were recommended by
the university. You won’t be
surprised to learn that the
scientific panel approved the
gas from wood project.

Why doesn’t W&L get in on
some of the DOE gravy train?

an idealogical theme for the
Republican party as a whole,
and is very similar to the
British Conservative party’s
media campaign of last spring.

Perhaps you’ve seen one of
the Republican ads. In early
February, the first, entitled
‘‘Land of Hope,’ aired national-
ly on ABC. The five-minute
message was about present
problems facing the nation:
Laws that restrict productivity,
inflation, and overtaxation
caused by government spen-
ding. ‘‘What went wrong, what
went wrong...in the Congress of
the United States,’’ says the ad.
“But tomorrow can be dif-
ferent...We have the resources
to restore prosperity.”

Throughout February, five
other messages, varying in
time from 30 seconds to five
minutes, appeared nationally.

“Earlier, our test marketing
of the messages produced
favorable responses from the
previewers,’’ said Republican
National Committee chairman
Bill Brock. ‘‘We believe the
television messages will help
promote the growing feeling
among Americans that the
Republican party can do a bet-
ter job than the Democrats in

restoring stability to America
— in both domestic and interna-
tional areas.”

These commercials are only a
part of the first phase of a three-
part plan, which will culminate
in June.

Business Team Honored

In National Competition

A team of students from
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics finished
with first runnerup honors at
the 1980 Intercollegiate
Business Games in Atlanta. The
W&L team placed second in a
field of 21 competing groups
from across the nation.

Washington and Lee
members of the team, all
seniors, included Robert Mar-
shall Merriman, Jr. of Spencer,
Va.; Raymond Charles Nugent
of Virginia Beach; Mark
Grahame Walker of Bethesda,
Md.; and David Walter West of
Washington, D.C. Faculty ad-

‘visor for the W&L team was Dr.

Joseph Goldsten, associate pro-
fessor of business administra-
tion.

The games began in early
January and tested the business
skills and managerial expertise

of the participating students to
manage a hypothetical firm in

financial arrears, and _ the
team’s task was to restore it to
profitability.

Each team teletyped a series
of decisions to the central com-
puter at Emory University,
which analyzed the merits of
each choice against a simulated
business environment and rank-
ed each team according to per-
formance.

The schools were categorized
in four divisions, and a winner
was chosen for each.

Wake Forest and Washington
and Lee both won their respec-
tive divisions, while Loyola of
Baltimore, Md., and Simon
Fraser University of Burnaby,
British Columbia, were other
division winners. It was from
these four schools that Wake
Forest emerged as the competi-
tion’s best.

More Praise For ‘Kramer’

by Paul Hendry

Perhaps the most critically and publicly ac-
claimed film of the year has arrived at Lex-
ington’s “State”: KRAMER VS. KRAMER. Part
of the popularity no doubt comes from the film’s
subject matter, American marital dilemmas that
have come to the forefront in recent years:
separation, divorce and child custody.

One of the film’s attributes is that it succeeds in
provoking a broad range of responses from its
compelling portrayal of the trials of a family being
wrenched apart without straining to make
strenuous moral and social comments. The story
itself is tightly constructed and focuses on the
ordeal of divorce for the parents and child. Any
impact or message imparted is derived from the
story itself and the strong performances by the ac-
tors — not through didactic rhetoric.

The acting moves beyond the competent and
solid efforts found in the minor roles to the truly
outstanding work exhibited in the four major
characters. Dustin Hoffman is the Madison Ave.
huckster around whom the story revolves. It is the
shock of separation from his estranged wife that
alerts him to a new awareness of fatherhood. The
film’s plot is centered around the touching growth
of his relationship with his son. He proves both a
warm father and a fiery competitor in his fight for
his son.

Mery] Streep, the latest and greatest, according
to popular media critics, lives up to her reputation
as the hurt and confused mother. By design, her
character is not a likeable one, and she never
presents an honest claim to her child in the
viewer’s mind for this reason. What is the au-
dience meant to think of her character and claim
to the child after she deserts her home to go to
California to ‘‘find’’ herself and become ‘‘a com-
plete human being?”’

The movie is definitely a father-son story, and
Justin Henry steals the show as the son with one of
the most affecting performances by a child in re-

Record Review

cent memory (since Tatum O’Neal in PAPER
MOON? Justin plays a totally believable, real,
seven year old — which I’m sure he is — and it is to
the director’s credit that he coaxes so engaging a
performance from him.

Jane Alexander’s role of friendly divorced
neighbor and companion of Hoffman is equally
well done. This relationship adds depth to Hoff-
man’s character and serves as a fine complement
to his own marital situation. Alexander’s
character, like the viewer, becomes a witness to
Hoffman’s and his son’s growth and adjustment
and accentuates the transitional period which is
the film’s emphasis.

The movie is shot against the cold and bleak
New York landscape that appropriately appears
to be perpetually in winter to lend a grey mood to
the happenings. Short scenes of great emotional
impact are shot in near silence and then fade-out
to black before the plot continues. These brief
glimpses bring the audience even closer to the
characters’ lives — as if the camera were in-
truding into their homes to give a special look or
insight. These scenes likewise sustain mood.

Tears are sure to be shed by many viewers, yet
KRAMER VS. KRAMER — like Hoffman’s
character — does not wallow in emotion. The light
touches of comedy found in everyday life are pre-
sent throughout and are a source of great enter-
tainment.

The first breakfast scene, the child’s encounter
with his father’s overnight ‘‘friend,’’ and the son’s

‘mutiny by eating ice cream instead of dinner

stand out in my mind because of their ability to in-
voke such a broad range of sympathies and
laughter.

The subject matter of KRAMER VS. KRAMER
may not sound thrilling, but the performances and
plot acutely reveal so much about human nature
and popular institutions that the chance to enjoy it
at least once should be a virtually iresistable pro-
spect for all.

 

Blotto; The Mingus Dynasty

By Mark Kinniburgh

We devote space this week to
a rock and a jazz favorite, with
help in the jazz department
from Spencer Leffel.

My rock favorite for the week
is a band from Albany, New
York named ‘‘Blotto.”” The
force behind ‘‘Blotto’’ is not the
music, although it is ample, but
rather the lyrics. A selection of
4 songs was just released on
Blotto records, their record
company, and even though the
Blotto singles won’t be found on
a record shelf at a store, you’ll
be hearing a lot from Blotto on
the radio.

I first became acquainted
with Blotto through a postcard
which simply said ‘‘Blotto is
coming.’ No earlier than two
months later, I receiwed an
envelope with nothing but a but-
ton that said, ‘“‘Hello my name
is Blotto, what’s yours?”’ Very
much intrigued by this time, I
sent a letter to the return ad-
dress on the postcard asking
what was going on, and I receiv-
ed a notice that a record was on

the way. Blotto seems to have a
very imaginative marketing
staff, which in turn promotes
their imaginitive musical ef-
forts.

Blotto itself is a new brand
made up of refugees from other
successful and_ not-so-
successful rock bands in the
upstate New York area, the
most notable of which was the
Washboard Band. Members of
Blotto have appeared in one
form or another on the Mike
Douglas show, stages at
Washington’s Cellar Door and
Austin’s Admadillo World
Headquarters, among many
others.

The strategy for Blotto in past
months has been to sharpen up
a live show for a national tour,
but without a record company’s
financial support, the tour will
be a difficult endeavor. Along
with radio support and record
sales there is a definite possi-
bility of Blotto’s continued ex-
istence in the music world.
WLUR will be airing the Blotto
singles and we’ll gladly accept

requests. Our favorite at WLUR
is ‘‘I Wanna Be a Lifeguard,” so
give it a listen!

This week’s jazz favorite is
“Chair In The Sky” by the
Mingus Dynasty, a group com-
posed almost entirely of alumni
from past bands of Charles
Mingus. Organized by Susan
Grahom Mingus, the wife of the
late bassist and composer, the
group’s personnel is not always
the same, but it is always
strong.

On this date John Handy
plays alto sax while Jimmy
Knepper handles trombone.
This pair worked with Mingus
during the classic Jazz
Workshop years of the late
1950's and early ’60’s. From
more recent Mingus groups
come two fine, under-rated
musicians, pianist Don Pullen
and trumpeter Jimmy Owens.
Dannie Richmond, the only
drummer Mingus had during
the last 20 years of his life, pro-
vides his usual tasteful yet ex-

Film Notes

The African Queen (1951) Humphrey Bogart won the Academy
Award for his performance as gin-swilling Charlie Alnutt, who
rescues missionary Katharine Hepburn from the Germans during
World War I. Their adventure to safety on an African riverboat is
‘comedy of the highest order. John Huston — who had previously
collaborated with Bogart on The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre — directed and, with James Agee, wrote the
script. Hepburn’s performance is considered to be one of he ‘inest.
Filmed on location in the Belgian Congo. With Robert Morley.
Presented by the SAB March 14 — 16 at 7 and 9 p.m. in Dupont

Sports

Outdoor Track
Opens At Home

Head coach Norris Aldridge
and 14 lettermen will lead the
1980 Washington & Lee track
team into its season opening
meet, which takes place Satur-
day, March 15 against David-
son.

Aldridge, beginning his 11th
year as head coach, reports that
W&L regularly fields a strong
track outfit, ‘mainly due to
depth in all areas. We can enter
two or three men in each event
and count on good per-
formances.”’

1980 appears as no exception
to this, with lettermen and a
host of newcomers blending to
give W&L strength across the
board.

In the distance events, three-
year letterman Richard Bird
and two-year letterman Chris
Daniel are the leaders. Bird is a
senior who holds school records
in the 800 and 1500 meter runs;
Daniel is a junior. Additional
distance men include senior
Ham Davis in the 880 and junior
Howard Herndon, sophomore
Greg Branan and freshman
John Kelafant in the three-mile
event.

In the springs, five lettermen
and two newcomers give W&L a
strong contingent. Senior and
co-captain Stewart Atkinson, a

three-year letterman, and
junior Jeff Brown, a two-year
letterman, compete in the 100,
200, and 440-yard = runs.
Freshman Pat McGuire joins
them in the 100 and 220. Junior
and two-year letterman Billy
Morris, sophomore and letter-
man Dave Cordell, junior and
letterman R. J. Scaggs and
senior Jimmy Parker all run
the 440.

In the weight department,
sophomore lettermen Buz Man-
ning, Bob Shaver and junior let-
terman Chip Nunley lead the
way. Manning puts the shot and

throws the discus, Nunley
throws the discus, and Shaver
hurls the javelin.

Joining them are senior Tony
Walker and junior Larry Davis
in the shot, sophomore Bill
Chesbrough in the discus,
freshman Eric Nelson in the
discus and javelin’ and
sophomore Mike Fogarty in the
javelin.

In the jumping events,
Aldridge counts on four let-
termen for leadership: Senior
and co-captain Paul Hendry in
the high jump; sophomores

Lacrosse Season Opener
Sat. Against Orangemen

by Dave Johnson

The W&L varsity lacrosse
team was defeated, 9-7, in an
exhibition game against a tough
Mt. Washington club team.

But despite the loss, Coach
Jack Emmer believes that his
team accomplished its objec-
tives in the tune-up match: ob-
taning valuable playing ex-
perience and executing well.

The came was very close, as
the Generals had tied it up in
the fourth quarter, but W&lI’s
difficulties in capitalizing on
scoring opportunities allowed
Mt. Washington to take the
game.

Both midfielder John Kemp
and freshman attackman Geoff
Wood scored two goals for the
Generals, but attackman Rob
Staugaitis came up with a goal
and five assists to earn himself
the ‘Cannon Award’’ for the
game. Emmer also praised the
play of defenseman Jim
Herbert and goalie Bob
Clements. Clements made 19
saves overall.

Emmer was also pleased with
his team's effort, citing their
hustle and determination as im-
portant strong points. He did
note, however, that his squad
did not Shoot as well as we
would have liked and that the
Generals must put more than
seven points on the board to win
games.

But considering the quality of
the Mt. Washington squad, an
opponent W&L_ has_ never
beaten, the Generals’ showing
was at least admirable.

Looking forward to the rest of
the season, the Generals will be

relying on the experience of
eighteen returning players who
have started at some time, in-
cluding midfielders George
Santos, John Hooper, Geoff
Brent and Kemp. On defense,
Clements and Herbert are the
key players to watch. Com-
plimenting these veterans will
be a strong corps of freshmen,
includind John Doub, John Tun-
ney and Joe Siefert at midfield
and Wood at attack.

Avoiding any predictions,or
even any showing of en-
thusiasm, Emmer looks for a
solid team which will be ‘‘very
competitive against a very
demanding schedule,’’ which is
a coach’s way of saying that
you'll have to wait and see.

The Generals begin the

regular season with their home
opener against the Syracuse
Orangemen this Saturday. Last
year’s Syracuse team ended the
season ranked sixth nationally
and defeated the 1979 Generals,
10-7.

Syracuse will be coming off a
victory against N.C. State and
Emmer expects ‘‘one hell of a
lacrosse game.” The Generals
look ready to take on the
Orangemen, who have been
ranked as high as sixth in
preseason polls.

This years looks to be another
in a long line of excellent
seasons for the W&L lacrosse
team and it is surely something
any sports fan would not want to
miss. Gametime on Wilson
Field this vee is 2:00 p.m.

 

Steve Johnson (29), Bob Clements (14) and Jim Herbert will read
the Generals on defense.

 

1980 Should Start New Lacrosse Decade

by Bill Whalen

1980 is the first year of a new
decade. And here at W&L, 1980
may also be the first year of a
new decade of lacrosse.

If one takes a close look at the
1980 lacrosse squad, much of
the future of this school’s
lacrosse program can be found.

Gone are the days when-a
W&L would enter the season
ranked in the nation’s top five.
Instead, in 1980, the W&L team
will not be found among the top
squads in consideration for the
national title.

On the contrary, this team
will have to pull a few upsets to
get both a good position in the
polls and consideration for the
postseason playoffs.

The reason is obvious. In a
time when money is being spent
generously to update and
popularize the sport of college
lacrosse, W&L has not been one
of the leading spenders.

Because of the school’s
‘laissez-faire’ attitude to
athletics in general and the idea
that the team does not have to
give scholarships to remain
among the nation’s elite, the

lacrosse program has_ been
equalled and/or surpassed in
several other universities.

But even though the program
has slipped, W&L still remains
as one of the most prestigious
teams in the country. If
anything, the Generals look like
the common man’s hero. When
the W&L lacrosse team takes
the field, it almost seems to be a
challenge between the big time
athletics and the wav college
sports used to be.

But being realistic, the little
man is almost always the first
to suffer in any type of squeeze
— hence the slip in the national
ratings. But don’t give up yet —
there still may be a turn-around
in the 1980’s — and this year in
particular.

If the Generals are entertain-
ing any thoughts of postseason
play, they will have to obtain a
good record. And considering
the 1980 schedule, the Generals
only have to play well at home
to earn a playoff berth.

W&L is scheduled to play 13
regular season games this year.
Of the thirteen games, eight are
at home and five are away. But

more importantly, almost each
team that the Generals will
compete against for a playoff
spot will be faced in Lexington.

Last year, Syracuse and N.C.
State occupied the seventh and
eighth spots, respectively in the
lacrosse tournament. Both
teams will take on the Generals
here in Lexington. And if the
Generals want a bid, they will
have to score convincing wins
over both of these teams.

From the
Pressbox

Of the five away opponents,
only Virginia is likely to make a
playoff appearance. Other op-
ponents such as Duke and
Hofstra don’t appear strong
enough to make a run.

But another interesting note
can be made about this year’s
schedule. If you look closely,
you will find Virginia Tech,
Baltimore University and Air
Force, all of which were not on
last year’s schedule.

 

 

None of these teams are con-
sidered among the nation’s
elite, although each is good
within its own rights. Each is in
a different class from the
Hopkins and Maryland teams,
however.

The Generals play them
because the good teams do not
want to play W&L anymore.
They figure that since the
Generals are not among the
highest rated, there is more to
risk than to gain from an en-
counter. The only way Johns
Hopkins could benefit from
playing W&L would be scoring a
total wipe-out. A close win or a
loss would only hurt its ranking.

So what is Jack Emmer to do
in this situation? Nothing, ex-
cept what he is doing right now
— which is trying to play the
best competition available and
hope for a good season. A good

season would guarantee some
attention and better recruits.
Which brings us back to our
original discussion of the im-
portance of the 1980 season. For
the program to keep up its suc-

cess, a good showing this season

is crucial.

With the rising cost of college
and the increasing amount of
scholarships at other schools, it
is imperative for this year’s
team to come out well. Such
strong finishes linger strongly
in the minds of impressionable
recruits.

So to this year’s team, I wish
plenty of luck. The schedule
seems to be in your favor and
everyone is rooting for you, so
good luck in your quest for the
playoffs.

Let’s make the 1980’s another
decade of successful lacrosse at
W&L.

Netmen Win Debut, 5-4

by Dale Park
Last Saturday, the
Washington & Lee Varsity
netmen faced a surprisingly
tough University of Rochester
tennis team. Unlike’ the
General’s easy 7-2 victory last
year, W&L squeezed to a 5-4 vic-

tory this time around.

“Eric Friedman, who played
first singles last year for
Rochester, was playing third
singles this year,”’ said head
tennis coach Gary Franke,
evidencing the new depth the
Yellowjackets have this year.

At first singles, W&L senior
co-captain Stewart Jackson fac-
ed young freshman Bob Swar-
tout. Swartout’s quickness
enabled him to take Jackson to

6-6 in the first set, yet the ex-
perienced senior prevailed 5-3
in the tie-breaker for a 7-6 win.
After the tie-breaker, it was
all Jackson as his powerful
serve and quick net play enabl-
ed him to breeze to a 6-2 victory
in the second set. W&L lost the

next two singles positions,
however.

Jackson Sharman, W&L’s
freshman second singles

player, fell to the other new
Rochester addition, freshman
Mike Mahoney, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. In
the meantime, W&L junior
Peter Lovell battled Friedman

at third singles.

Lovell lost the first set, 7-6, in
a close 5-2 tie-breaker, came
back to take the next set 7-5, but
succumbed in the third set, 6-3.
Yet the Generals rebounded by
taking the next two singles
flights.

Senior co-captain David Con-
stine, in a tough fourth singles

 

Dave Constine

match versus Yellowjacket
Alex Gaeta, prevailed 6-2, 2-6,
6-4, while W&L teammate Steve
Denny, a freshman at fifth
singles, downed Rochester’s
John Conlin by the nearly iden-
tical score of 6-2, 4-6, 6-4.

But the Yellowjackets forced
a 3-3 split in the six singles mat-
ches as Generals’ freshman

Mike Read, playing at sixth
singles, failed to get on track
versus Scott Semisch and fell
6-3, 6-4.

The outcome of the match
depended sntirely on the three
doubles matches.

The first doubles match
belonged to W&L as Jackson
teamed with senior Pat Norris
to defeat Rochester’s Swartout
and Mahoney 6-3, 7-6, (a 5-3 tie-
breaker). But in the third
singles it was all Rochester, as
Gaeta and Semisch swept past
Sharman and Denny of W&L
6-4, 6-3.

This left one match, the se-
cond doubles, in which W&L’s
Lovell and his teammate, junior
faced Yellow-
jackets Friedman and Conlin:
Although they lost the first set
6-2, Lovell and Gaker thundered
back to overwhelm their op-
ponents, 6-2, 6-1, and gave the
Generals an important opening

Doug Gaker,

match victory.

In all, five of the nine matches
played went to three sets.

‘“‘We didn’t anticipate
Rochester being as tough as
they were,’’ said Franke. ‘“‘We
let Gaker rest and just play
doubles, but it’s hard to tell how
much that effected the out-
come.”’

Joe Farrell, who has played

some of the best tenor sax I’ve

Charlie Haden fills the Mingus’

Mingus has done.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

“Told You So...”

Consider this fair warning. The Student Activities
Board is now making plans for Spring Weekend (May
2).

Will the Four Tops be the SAB’s spring band? Could
the sellout by Monday of 200 tickets for tommorow
night’s Nighthawks late show be an indication of the
student body’s preference in music? We don’t know
yet, but you can get in on the ground floor. Discussion
of the spring concert will resume this Sunday at 7:30
p.m. in the SAB’s second floor office in the University
Center building.

From The Editor’s Desk

Americans across the country should be outraged by the latest
example of broken promises and political cover-up to come out of
the Carter Administration’s Justice Department.

Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti told the Senate Banking
and Judiciary Committees Tuesday that a two-year Justice Depart-
ment investigation of questionable Textron and Bell Helicopter
payments ‘‘has not revealed evidence that Mr. Miller was informed
by anyone of improper payments.”’ Mr. Civiletti said that because
of this report and a technicality in the Ethics in Government Act, no
special prosecutor would be appointed to investigate the Security
and Exchange Commission’s charges against Treasury Secretary
G. William Miller.

‘None of the assertions that Secretary Miller has committed a
criminal violation have been substantiated by the investigation
conducted since early 1978,’’ the attorney general continued.

Yet the evidence against Mr. Miller was so strong that both
Democrats and Republicans called for the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate the charges. Among the SEC’s charges:
—That Textron Inc. wined and dined Pentagon officials out of a
$600,000 slush fund from 1971 to 1978 (a federal offense) and then
doctored the company’s books and records to conceal the entertain-
ment expenses ;

—That while Mr. Miller was chairman and chief executive of Tex-
tron, the company made 13 payments totaling $5.4 million to of-
ficials in 10 foreign countries over an eight-year period to convince
them to buy Bell Helicopters;

—That Mr. Miller had made “erroneous and misleading”’
statements to stockholders at Textron’s annual meetings in 1976
and 1977, when he assured them that the company had not made im-
proper payments to foreign officials;

—And that Mr. Miller and other top Textron officers ‘‘made false
and misleading representations”’ to the Senate Banking Committee
in 1978, during the Treasury Secretary’s confirmation hearings by
falsifying company records and doctoring or destroying documents
to hide the improper payments.

The SEC does not make such charges lightly. (It is important to
note that 11 top officers of Textron Inc. took the Fifth Amendment
when questioned about the payments. )

Mr. Miller has maintained his innocence in the payments matter,
although he told the Senate Banking Committee last month that he
knew of the $600,000 worth of ‘‘meals’’ for Defense Department
employees—a contradiction of his 1978 testimony before the same
committee—and called the illegal practice ‘‘not serious.”’

What is most disturbing is that the Carter Administration has
promoted Miller as being an excellent manager and administrator.
If he is, how could he not have known of $5.4 million in illegal
payments in his own company? How much can the American tax-
payers depend on this man to watch the nation’s money, where
there are many more millions of dollars to lose than there were at
Textron?

The Carter Administration has handled the Miller matter as bad-
ly as it handled the Lance affair. With a strong case made by the
impartial SEC that Mr. Miller has at least committed perjury, the
failure to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the charges
against the Treasury Secretary is yet another blemish on the
apolitical and pristine image the Administration has attempted to
project. Mr. Miller is known to be popular within the Administra-
tion (as Mr. Lance was), a factor which supports the notion that a
political fix has occurred in the Justice Department to help the
charges fade away.

Mr. Civiletti’s announcement Tuesday is, at least, an indication
that the Justice Department is as politically partial under Jimmy
Carter—who promised fairness—as it was under Richard Nixon,
making a mockery of the word ‘‘justice.”’

The only hope remaining is that Senators William Proxmire and
Bob Dole will continue their vigorous pursuit of the Miller case and
not allow these serious charges to fade into the background.

Letters To The Editor

Student Vandalized Second Time

Dear Editor:

For the second time in less
than a month, my car has been
vandalized while parked out-
side the University Center. The
first incident left my car
without an antennae, and a dent
in the hood. Following last
weekend’s rampage I will now
be driving minus one window.

Although owning a converti-
ble inevitably makes one a
more likely target for vandals,
college students should be
above such juvenile behavior.
Being an eternal optimist, I
would like to believe that the
destruction could be credited to
the ‘‘townies.”’

Unfortunately, I was foolish
enough to believe that the
‘‘bush-killing’’ incident was
committed by persons outside
the W&L community.

Vandalism is also very
prevalent within the confines of
the freshman dormitories. The
number of windows broken
each weekend is phenomenal.

Persiflage

Last weekend, for example,
trash was thrown throughout
the dorm, glass from broken
beer and liquor bottles littered
the floors, the stench of sulfur
smoke bombs wafted in the air,
and quite a few light bulbs were
knocked out.

Vandalism of a more serious
sort is also on the rise. Wallets,
records, and other valuables
are often reported missing from
dorm rooms. Once again the
‘‘townies”’ are blamed.

It is time the E.C. and the ad-
ministration recognized the
severity of this problem, and
dealt with it accordingly. Van-
dalism within the jurisdiction of
the University would not be too
particularly difficult to resolve.

Increased awareness of the
problems on the part of dorm
counselors would most likely
cut down on misdeeds within
the dorms. The counselors were
certainly not hired as
policemen, but at times a firm
hand is necessary.

Controlling delinquency in
areas surrounding immediate
University property is admit-

tedly more difficult to deter.
Ideally all students should
adhere to the principles of

gentlemenly conduct.
Then perhaps the W&L com-
munity would only have to con-

cern itself with the ‘‘townies.’’
Scott S. Bond ’83

Irony

Dear Editor:

The ironies of our little world
constantly amuse me. Each day
the faculty reiterates the opi-
nion that the student body needs
moral and social guidance.

Yet, I find that they have
scheduled the calendar so that
Easter Sunday lies in the midst
of final exams. This celebration
of the redemption of man is
usually set aside by believers as
a time of prayer and family
gatherings. Here it will be
forgotten among cold tests and
cafeteria beans.

God and our faculty works in
mysterious ways. They must
know what’s best for us.

Christopher DuRant

 

The Secret Of Success

Well, Mexico was just beautiful. I’d tell you all
about the enormous quantities of drugs and
beautiful women that are available south of the
border, but my editor continues to constrict the
space open to this grossly underappreciated col-
umn. Instead, I’ve decided to share with you the
secret of my success.

People are constantly coming up to me and ask-
ing, “Percy, how do you do it? How did you learn
to totally submerge all ethical and moral judg-
ment to the pursuit of wealth?”

Usually, I have to clear up some misconcep-
tions. Some guys have been so warped by all this
intellectual stuff that they automatically assume I
must have some kind of master philosophy to
justify my amorality. But that’s baby stuff,

Spencer, Carnegie, and the other Social Dar-
winists may make nice bedtime primers for the
kiddies, but they hardly help one actually reach
the pinnacle of material accumulation. I mean, if
you spend all your time trying to justify what
you've already done there’s no time left for fun,
right?

The same thing goes for all that stuff the C-
school tries to push off on people. Sure, they teach
you a bunch of neat little graphs and formulas, but
what help are those in showing you how to fore-
close on the local orphanage or how to quietly get

rid of the old widow in the tenement you’ve plann-
ed to turn into a condo?

For that sort of cold-hearted action you need the
type of experience that comes only from practice.
You could try to learn it on the job, but that sort of
lackadaisical attitude will condemn you to a life of
bitter drunken nights, a wife with a trailer for a
rear-end, and two weeks of Disneyland every
year. In short, you’ll end up a salesman or an of-
fice water cooler jockey.

Yet, if you plan ahead, you might be able to
avoid such a fate. A life of physical pleasure can
be yours as long as you learn early on to jettison
those unwieldy morals.

My own suggestion to this end, and it might seen
rather simple, is to play ‘Monopoly’ everyday.
What it lacks in realism it easily makes up in the
training it provides in becoming a real s.o.b.
(Take it from Percy.)

You learn to take pleasure in crushing your op-
ponents. You can feel the thrill of power and the in-
toxication of profit as you order some hapless vic-
tim to cough up the rent or clear out. The
adrenalin rush while counting one’s money is, by
itself, enough of a reason to play.

This ‘indoctrination into the vacuous world of
business ethics will always be valuable. Not only
will you feel better about yourself, you’ll also not
give a damn about what others think of you.

“Hey Dad, I’ve been looking at one of your old Washington and
Lee catalogues that I found up in the attic but I’m having some
trouble understanding some of the words in it.”’

“Bring it here son and let’s have a look at it. Now, what’s giving
you trouble?”’

“‘Let’s see... what’s an ‘all male institution?’.”’

“Well son I know you'll find this hard to believe, but that’s
another name for a college or university in which you just have
men and no women.”’

“You're kidding Dad?!!! You went to a school for just men?
Where did all the women go?”’

‘In those days they went to all women’s schools; five of them
were located pretty close to W&L.”’

‘“‘What was W&L like without girls Dad?”’

“It’s funny son, but college life was great back then. You see,
classes were very small and the students all had a great time learn-
ing and socializing with the faculty. Most of our time was spent stu-
dying, but there were times for parties, too, and boy were they ever
good ones. In fact, the school was like one big college class;
everyone knew everyone else and we all enjoyed the friendship and
superb education the small size and single sex atmosphere W&L
provided.

It’s not that we were afraid of them son, it’s just that single sex
schools gave people the freedom to choose the type of atmosphere
they wanted. Co-ed schools did exist for those that wanted both boys
and girls on the same campus together, but for the most part, it was
tradition for boys and girls to go to separate schools in my day.”

“Dad, what’s this ‘tradition’ you’re talking about?”’

“Son, that’s where over the course of time a set way of doing
things is recognized as being the best and most enjoyable way anda
change would only be for the worst.”’

“Then why did W&L stop this ‘tradition?’”’

‘Because the people there didn’t appreciate a good thing when
they had it. They thought it would be fun to have girls around all the
time: on their athletic teams, in their classes, in their dorms, in
their showers, etc. They also thought it would be great not having to
fool with road-trips anymore.”’

‘Roadtrip, what’s that?”’

“That means we had to drive to the girl’s schools to see them. It
was nice because putting on a clean set of clothes and seeing the
girls became a special occasion and we looked forward to seeing
them when we wanted to, not because we had to, as in the case of a
co-ed school.”’

“Gosh Dad, I wish those days were still here, they sure sounded
great.”’

“They were. Well, I hope I’ve helped you out a little bit son, I
know it’s hard trying to understand those old catalogue terms for
things that don’t exist anymore.”’

You sure have Dad, but I did have one more word to ask you
about.”’ .

‘“‘What’s that son?”’

‘“‘What’s a fraternity?”

Dear Editor and Students of
Washington & Lee University:

gratulate you on the success of
your Fancy Dress Ball. Despite
the problems of the snow on
Saturday, Friday night seemed
like it was a success.

It is wonderful to see all the

Support For

Feinman’s
Constitution
Dear Editor:

We heartily support Jim Fein-
man’s new IFC constitution.
Fienman bold, thoughtful, in-
itiative is just what is needed to
propel the fraternity system in-
to a healthy, much needed new

along so well. Usually you are
divided up by fraternities — but
on this one night you seemed
united as a university. I think
that is one of the best things that
could come out of a weekend
like Fancy Dress.

So students of W&L you may
pat yourselves on the back. It is
nice to see unity in Lexington,
too bad it cannot happen more
often.

Sincerely,

Mountains,

Dear Editor:

In the natural progression of
molehills to mountains, found
only in the smallest enclaves of
frustrated sycophantics, lies
the latest example of Rossian
diplomacy. Kevin Ross, who
succeeded in turning an un-
conscious oversight on my part
into a major reprimand by the
Executive Committee of the
Ring-tum Phi and _ business
manager Kevin McGowan, suf-
fers from this syndrome. I call
it the Burt Lance syndrome

(because of his | stiking
resemblance to the former
Budget Director).

Plagued by the ever present
problem—lack of time—I did
not deliver 300 copies of the
newspaper to the law center on
the Thursday afternoon of Fan-
cy Dress weekend. (I apologize
to all for this oversight. I had in-
tended to deliver the papers,
but it slipped my mind. )

But law students should not
despair. Mr. Ross waited until
midnight Thursday and when

 

the paper failed to materialize
he set the ball rolling for the en-
suing storm.

There was no need for Kevin
McGowan to be castigated at
the hands of the . Executive
Committee. I had
spoken with representative
Fraser, President Abraham, as
well as Mr. Ross. There was no
need for Ross to pursue this
matter. It is a silly matter em-
braced by a silly man.

But where a simple problem
was correctly handled by a con-
ference with all involved par-
ties, Ross, like a Sydney
Greenstreet character, decided
to propel this very simple mat-
ter into a major E.C. discus-
sion.

The Ring-tum Phi has
assured all parties that this
oversight will not occur again.
It had done so before Monday
night’s meeting and now does so
again.

Secondly, I guarantee
delivery to the law school of the
Ring-tum Phi in the future.

But to Mr. Ross, who acted ir-

responsibly and in an immature
manner, let him eat cake.

The Ginsburg Affair Continued

Dear Editor:

In the March 6 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Brian Ginsburg
replied to my letter of the Feb.
28 issue. Although this is getting
a bit old, Ginsburg still fails to
deal with the salient point in my
letter either because he is not of
sufficient intellectual depth to
do so or because he is choosing
to ignore it. Since he is a stu-
dent at W&L, I shall presume
the latter. The issue is not if
posters are signed or if they
foster discussion on campus.
The question here is whether
one individual, in this case
Ginsburg, has the right to judge
another’s posters and then
destroy the posters if his
criteria are not met.

For me, we are questioning
whether we are going to have a
free society. If people like
Ginsburg are going to judge and
destroy at will, other people will
be restricted in their right to ex-
pression. Ginsburg does not
speak to this issue at all but in-
stead diverts our attention to
tangential issues like

autographing posters.

A Dean of W&L, Lewis G.
John, says it well in a letter op-
posite to Ginsburg’s regarding
the SABU lecture: ‘“‘the univer-
sity community exists as a
forum for an open exchange of
ideas and points of view.’’ But
Ginsburg has decided he will
veto the Dean in that he will
regulate which ideas and points
of view will be exchanged. This
is wrong and I protest against
it. =

Brian, in your letter you ac-
cused me of making an “‘at-
tack’”’ on you. The Ring-tum Phi
headline called my letter an at-
tack not me. The last thing in
the world I want to do is to at-
tack you, On the contrary, as
much as I abominate your point
of view and am fearful of its
becoming widespread, I will
always defend your right to say
it.

It is you who is on the attack
— attacking the natural right of
human beings and the civil
right of Americans to openly
and freely express their point of

To the editor:

This Ginsberg affair is get-
ting out of hand and becoming
ridiculous. All of the controver-
sy and rhetoric boils down to
one simple fact; Mr. Ginsberg
is an admitted thief and as such
should have been expelled from
W&L.

His unbelievable arrogance
aside; idealogues are not im-
mune from the honor code. A
thief is a thief is a thief. The

been grossly unfair.

How can a plagiarist, who is
convicted on relatively shaky
evidence, be kicked out of

has admitted and is indeed pro-
ud of his thievery, not even be
indicted? So much for the
fairness of the honor system.

I would sincerely hope that if

threat to commit future crimes,
that he be subject to the same

Corrigan told Keesler that
