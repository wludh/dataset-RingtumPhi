Bands Ban St cninntdonend |

by John Billmyre
The University Council recon-
sidered banning paid live music
during the week in fraternity
houses Wednesday nights and
once again voted the measure
down.

Banning live music from
fraternities is a measure which
has surfaced this year, but is
really the outgrowth of an issue
that came up last year.

At the heart of the matter is a
faculty resolution, passed last
year, aimed at stopping mid-

Basketball Team Wins ODAC

by Dale Park

“IT am extremely proud of
these young men. They have
weathered an adverse season
with great character and pride
and represented themselves
very well.”’

W&L head basketball coach
Verne Canfield said these words
for a very good reason — his
hoopsters were 0.D.A.C. cham-
pions again for the third time in
four years after winning the
conference tournament held at
Hampden-Sydney, February
21-23.

To top it all off, the Generals
defeated HampdenSydney in
the championship game on the
Tiger’s home court, 58-56, on an
18-foot jump shot at the buzzer
by W&L center Rob Smither-
man. ‘I have fonder feelings for
this squad than any other team
Ihave coached,”’ said Canfield.

The Generals began the tour-
nament by defeating the Emory
& Henry Wasps, 56-50 for W&L’s

week parties in fraternities.

During the UC meeting
Wednesday several faculty
members said the resolution is
being upheld in letter, but not in
spirit.

The issue came up Wednes-
day because the faculty is
displeased with the comti-
nuance of mid-week parties.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John said, “there should be an
end to mid-week parties, no
matter how they are financed.”

John said he was speaking

third win over E&H this season.
Smitherman led the Generals’
attack with 15 points and seven
rebounds. Senior forward Tom
Jeffries scored twelve points
and grabbed five rebounds,
while sophomore guard George
Spears chipped in ten points.
The other two “‘blues”’ (start-
ing five) players, junior for-

 

Sen. George
Metipees (D-S.D.), irs
Democratic candidate for
President, will speak at

ficulties into the 1980s.

Scheduled for 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel, McGovern’s address is
open to the public at no charge.

A native of South Dakota,
George McGovern has long
been recognized as a liberal
leader in Congressional circles.
He began his career as a pro-

EC members study loan committee revisions during Monday
‘night’s meeting.

‘Loan Committee

Revamped by EC

by John Billmyre
The Executive Committee
discussed and debated the
operations of the Student
Emergency Loan Committee

-for nearly two hours Monday

night when the Committee’s

Chairman told the EC about ir-:

regularities in the Committee’s
operations.

Only a few of the EC
members knew about the
SELC, its funding or its opera-
tions.

When the smoke had cleared
and the dust had settled, the EC
had passed a series of motions
to correct problems in the
SELC’s operation.

While SELC Chairman Jim
Vines, who is also Chairman of
the Cold Check Committee, said

the EC motions might clear up
the problems experienced by
the SELC, he expressed doubts
about the EC discussion.

“I just question that the ef-
fects I really wanted to bring
about were not the major issues
of the discussion,”’ said Vines
after the EC meeting.

During the meeting Vines told
the EC the SELC has been run
by a few members of one frater-
nity during the past few years.

He said the SELC has loose,
unwritten rules which have
been made up as it gave out
loans.

“Freeman Jones, (Chairman
of the SELC last year) told me
that the rules for the commit-
tee’s operation had changed,

nalism at W&L.

Tho publisher describes the
book as ‘‘a no-holds-barred in-
vestigation of the scandals,
abuse of power, and

Women Respond
To Wife Ad

John Hart has thousands of
women from all over the coun-
try calling and writing him.

Hart, a laborer and rancher
in Colstrip, Mont., became so
popular by telling a small Mon-
tana newspaper that he is sear-
ching for a wife to help him at
his lonely ranch. The story was
picked up by The Associated
Press and_ circulated
throughout the country, produc-
ing a flood of response.

The wife-hunter says he has
been married once, although of-
ficial records show he has ac-
tually been married twice. He
also claims to be 33, but one of
his marriage licenses indicates
he is 44.

Despite these minor
discrepencies the calls have
been coming in. A number of
well-meaning parents have
thought Hart might be perfect
for their daughters.

Students Produce T.V. Show

Journalism students. at
Washington and Lee University
are producing a weekly news
program on public television in-
tended expressly to meet the in-
terests and needs of viewers in
far southwestern Virginia, the
‘“‘mountain empire,’’ who have
no local daily newspaper or
television news coverage and
little radio coverage.

‘‘Southwest Chronicle’’
presents a half-hour summary
of state news, news of the
southwest region, sports,
agriculture and_ business
reports, and newsmaker
features.

Joseph B. Dashiell, a senior
journalism major from Norfolk,
is producer and anchorman for
the program. Half-a-dozen
other W&L journalism majors
work directly on ‘Southwest
Chronicle” as well, and there
are 14 writers and two senior
reporters.

“Southwest Chronicle’ is
broadcast each Friday evening
on WSVN (channel 47), a public-
television station in Norton in
Wise County. WSVN is a
satellite of WBRA (channel 15),

Roanoke, and WBRA also

Annual

Condom Week

We're sorry but you've
already missed the officially
recognized date.

The week of Feb. 14-21 was
the state of Maine’s Second An-
nual Condom Week.

There was even a Condom
Week Committee whose job it
was ‘‘to dispel myths and misin-
formation about condoms and
to promote their use by the sex-
ually active population.”

A spokesman for the commit-
tee, Marjorie Love, cited the
importance of Condom Week:
‘In this day of supposed sexual
sophistication, the condom has
been joked about, maligned,
given a bad name and often
forgotten.”

We’re sure the W&L student
body will heed the words of Ms.
Love on the importance of Con-
dom Week and choose this
weekend to honor and promote
the lowly “rubbery sheath.”’

According to R. H. Mac-
Donald, the head of W&L’s jour-
nalism program and faculty
supervisor of ‘Southwest
Chronicle,’’ few daily
newspapers circulate at all in
far southwest Virginia,
although it encompasses 10
counties and a quarter-million
people — and those daily papers
are principally concerned with
coverage of their ‘“‘home’’ areas
in Tennessee, West Virginia and
Kentucky.

Weekly newspapers exist in
nine of the 10 counties, but their
coverage is strictly local, Mac-
Donald notes. Television sta-
tions which reach the area
operate in the same manner as
the daily press, focusing on
news of other areas, he says.

Course

Fifteen Washington and Lee
students will live at Mary
Baldwin College this spring
when an_ interdisciplinary
course—‘‘Male-Female
Relations’ —will once again be
offered.

Interdepartmental 250, an ex-
amination of sex roles and role
relationships from the perspec-
tives of biology, law, literature,
philosophy, psychology,
sociology and theology, will be
taught by both W&L and MBC
faculties. Professor David

The 3-credit course, which
was born three years ago when

decided to encourage students

Offered

‘‘to get to know members of the
opposite sex as people—not just
potential dates,”’ will begin with

a week of supervised reading.
Then, the remaining four weeks

of the course will be at MBC.

Baker Spring, an alumnus of
the course two years ago, noted
that one of his favorite things
about the course that it was an
open seminar and covered
many disciplines.

But the course’s original con-
cept is still the same. ‘‘Let’s
face it,’’ said Professor Sue
Rosser, a founder and MBC’s
co-ordinator, in a national stu-
dent magazine feature on the
course. ‘‘Understanding
masculine and feminine roles is
useful in everything you do
from your personal relation-
ships to your success in the
business world.”

University Federation

Volunteers Are Helping In Many Ways

by Robert Massie

If you happen to be looking for
Paul Koehler on any given Fri-
day afternoon, chances are you
won't be able to find him. Paul,
a senior from El Paso, Texas,
gives his Friday afternoons to
the elderly men and women
housed in the Geriatric ward of
the Western State Hospital in
Staunton, Virginia.

Every Friday after classes,
he and four other volunteers
carpool to Staunton as part of
the Western State ‘‘outreach”
program, only one of the many
such programs co-ordinated
through the University Federa-
tion. There the volunteers may
play basketball with the kids in
Substance Abuse or sit and talk
with the elderly, or just listen to
what the patients have to say.

The students are there to give

the patients something they
rarely have, contact with life
outside Western State. Paul is
the co-ordinator of the pro-
gram, which at present has
about eight volunteers who
travel to Staunton several times
a week. But, all told, there are
over 200 students volunteering
their time to the various pro-
grams the University Federa-
tion offers.

The Federation is headed this
year by Mark Broughton, a
senior from Virginia Beach.
The Federation is strictly
volunteer and _ co-ordinates
several programs aimed at giv-
ing students practical ex-
perience in community aid;
while offering the community
various social services. Big

Conference Held On Library Resources

The function of the
undergraduate college library
and the kinds of conflicting
pressures it must face were the
focus of a two-day conference at
Washington and Lee University
last week involving more than
70 librarians, professors and ad-
ministrators from 15 private

program and a local tutoring
program are just some of the
social services now operating.

The Big Brother program is
co-ordinated by Brian
Ginsberg, a junior from
Narberth, Pennsylvania, and
provides fatherless boys with
students who take them to the
movies, or to a local basketball
game or bowling. The students
are requested to spend a
minimum of B hours a week
with the boys and are encourag-
ed to participate for the full
year. Last semester there were
about 20 Big Brothers and the
number has jumped to about 25
this term.

The community fix up pro-
gram, which has just been
organized, provides student
labor for lower income families
who wish to fix up their homes.
The students do odd jobs such
as painting or fixing the plumb-
ing in homes around the city,

But by far the most popular
program is the tutoring pro-
gram.

Last term about 70 students
visited area schools and helped
the teachers with students who
were having trouble in their
classes. This term the number
of tutors has dropped to about
35, but this is still 4 good turnout
for the program. The tutoring
program is run on a term by
termbasis by Carol Chappel
from her office in the Student
Center.

liberal-arts colleges in Virginia.

The conference, ‘Library
Resources for College
Scholars,’’ was sponsored by
the Washington and Lee
Library as the first in a series of
events leading to the formal
dedication of its new $9-million
building in May.

Maurice D. Leach Jr., head

University Federation y seen
a dramatic surge in student in-
volvement. This year almost
one-sixth of the student body
will be involved in one program
or another and Mark Broughton
attributes much of the increase
to the recent involvement of the
University’s Psychology
department.

‘About 70 percent of the
students involved, volunteer
due to the extra credit the
department offers,’’ says
Broughton. The psychology
department offers extra credit
in Many courses to students
who become involved in one or
more of the programs.

The key idea in the programs
is ‘‘volunteer’’. Whether a stu-
dent is receiving credit for his
work or participating simply
for the satisfaction of helping
someone who needs help, he is
giving up several hours a week
from a busy college schedule.

Whether he is acting as a big
brother to a fatherless child, or
giving an elderly person some-
one to talk to, the student is
helping those around him and
showing a sense of responsibili-
ty to the community in which
Washington and Lee exists, and
for this they should be com-
mended,

If you would like to become
involved in any of the programs
mentioned in the article above,
see Carol Chappell in the Stu-
dent Center or call Mark
Broughton at 463-2355.

W&L librarian, defined the

general topic of the conference

as an examination of the ques-
tion ‘‘what library resources—if
any—are needed to support
research on a small, private,
liberal-arts campus.”’

And in a summary review,
William J. Watt, dean of The
College at Washington and Lee,
described the ‘‘conflicts’’ the
conference had _identified—
‘‘students versus faculty; books
versus machines; shared
resources versus special collec-
tions; balance versus additional
support for new programs; a
directed development of collec-
tions versus meeting faculty
needs or demands.

“But unfortunately,” Watt
said, ‘‘there seems to be no ab-
solute right and no absolute
wrong. Its library is central to
the educational process at any
college or university, and
because the strength of our pro-
grams will determine whether
our institutions survive, these
are critically important ques-
tions for us to consider.

“Solutions will come out of
groups such as this—involving
faculty, students, ad-
ministrators and librarians.”’

Throughout the series of con-
ference sessions, lectures,
panels and small-group discus-
sions, the conference addressed
issues that included:

—Whether : library resources
should be centered solely on the
curriculum or whether _in-
dividuals’ research re-
quirements should also be met;

—Means beyond traditional
collections that might be
employed to support research;

—Whether a small college
should even attempt to promote
research.

—Which techniques for col-
lection development are the
most effective;

The W&L library plans to
publish the proceedings of the
conference later this year.

Ensemble To Appear In Chapel

A performance by the An-
napolis Brass Quintet will con-

clude the Washington and Lee .

University Concert Guild’s
season Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
W&L’s Lee Chapel.

Since its formation several
years ago, the Annapolis Brass
Quintet has become the busiest
and most respected ensemble of
its type both in Europe and in
North America. The group has
made three tours of European
countries in the past 18 months
— including an appearance in
Vienna’s magnificent
Brahmshaal. Its appearance in
that capital of musical tradi-
tionalism marked the first ma-
jor recital ever given in Vienna
by a brass quintet, and the per-
formers were allowed to leave
the stage only after several en-
cores and a standing ovation.

‘The

by Dash Coufal

This is as much a Car] Reiner
movie as it is a Steve Martin
movie. Whereas Martin’s style
as a comedian has been total in-
sincerity, the character he
plays in The Jerk is based on
total sincerity; Martin plays an
oaf, not a sharpie.

Martin plays a black share-
cropper’s son who finds out he is
adopted and so leaves his home
for St. Louis to find his fortune.
He first starts working at a gas
station (where there is a
tremendous scene with some
defective cans) and then at a
carnival where he works guess-
ing peoples weight, selling
pizza-in-a-cup, and running the

In addition to tours during the
concert season, the Quintet has
an impressive list of summer
music festivals to its credit, in-'
cluding the Carinthian Summer
Festival in Austria and the
Casals Festival in Spain. Its
members have recorded per-
formances on numerous com-
mercial labels.

Commenting on their role in
today’s music world, members
of the Quintet mention two
primary aims — rediscovery of
old masterpieces in the brass
repertoire and frequent per-
formances of new compositions
for brass ensembles. Many
famous American and Euro-
pean composers have written
works specially for the An-
napolis musicians, and group
members themselves have
spent years uncovering and

miniature choo-choo. There he
meets a woman stunt-rider who
takes him on as her lover. She is
sooo PUNK and everyone else
in the theatre thought she was
funny, but I didn’t get it;
doesn’t everyone’s girlfriend
dress in black leather?

While running the choo-choo
Martin meets Bernadette
Peters and falls in love with
her, but this S&M mistress
breaks it up. Martin leaves the
carnival to find fame and for-
tune and thus wins her back.

He does find fame and for-
tune, and wins back Ber-

nadette, but then loses it all.

There are some _ hilarious
scenes though of Martin spen-

 

rearranging compositions from
the Renaissance and Baroque
periods.

At Washington and Lee, the
Annapolis Quintet’s program
will include a composition by
W&L music professor Robert
Stewart, as well as pieces by a
host of old and new masters —
Bach, Pezel, Molineux,
deCabezon, Etler, Pauer,
Robert Washburn, Speer and
Susato.

Admission to the concert is by
season ticket or $3 individual
performance fee. In addition,

tin; as in the restaurant where

‘her reaction to being served

escargots is priceless.

The directing by Reiner
shows that he is a master of
comedy. Each scene is fully
played-out . (unlike MEAT-
BALLS) yes is never over long
(as Woody Allen can be). His
directing is a paradigm.of com-
edy direction; it is clean and
uncluttered.

The Jerk is what Jerry Lewis
movies should have been. It is
missing the two annoying Lewis
elements: pathos and Jerry
himself. Lewis’ movies always
had some sort of a plot that in-
cluded both sympathy for
Lewis’ role, and a_ totally

straight girlfriend for Lewis;
both ruined the comedy by mak-
ing what was funny become em-
barassing for Lewis, and thus
for the audience. The
characters Martin and Peters
play in The Jerk are in the same
vein as the two crazy Czech
brothers on Saturday Night
Live, not the pathetic wretches
Lewis played.

One must remember that a
stand-up-comic can be funnier
than a movie because he doesn’t
have to sustain a plot and can

jump out of character to com-
ment; thus The Jerk isn’t as

funny as Martin’s stage per-
formances, yet it is a funny
movie.

Coppola’s Stallion:‘Well Worth Seeing’

by Paul Hendry

Adapted from Walter
Farley’s well known children’s
novel, “The Black Stallion’’ is
United Artists’ box office sur-
prise of the season. Although
not currently playing in Lex-
ington, ‘“The Black Stallion’ is
well worth seeing for a
refreshing change of pace. It is
not a children’s movie despits
its “G” rating—a label that
usually discourages the crowds.
Not that a child would not enjoy
the tender and often exciting
tale of a boy and his horse that

lies at the heart of the film, but
the deliberate pacing and artful
photography is best ap-
preciated by the more percep-
tive and frequent film-goer.
“The Black Stallion’ is not
artful in such a way that stifles
the entertaining quality of the
movie. The carefully
photographed sea and_land-
scapes, particularly in the first
half, lend a sense of beauty and
mystery to the simple plot that
is seldom seen in commercial
films. ‘‘The Black Stallion’’ was
produced by Francis Ford Cop-

pola. If one were to speculate on
his role in the film making, one
might suggest the influence of
‘Apocalypse Now’ is present in
the spectacular images along
with the creative use of the
score for maximum effect.
“The Black Stallion,”’ like Cop-
pola, seems to maximize der-
rive power from the essential
elements of the medium-sight
and sound-than any other
American filkmaker. _

The plot is streamlined. A boy

Review Knocks The Knack

by Mark Kinniburgh

Currently on the record market list are two

noteworthy records that deserve closer inspection
than a look at the album cover. I am speaking of
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ latest release
“Damn the Torpedoes’’ and the Knack’s second
effort ‘“‘The Little Girls Understand.” The reason
for inspection here is to caution against a waste of
money for the Knack album and bring attention to
Petty’s fine work.

With record prices so high now, the purchase of
a new album is a risky task because we cannot
always be sure of the entire album from the basis
of a single played on the radio. The Knack really
does not deceive the public, though, as the song
getting AM radio airplay ‘‘Baby Talks Dirty”’ is
representative, almost to the note, of the rest of
the album. Actually, there is little difference bet-
ween the first and second album, and even then,
the only points of departure are the actual lyrics
themselves. What ‘‘My Sharona’’ did for the
Knack on the first effort is not even approached on
this second fiasco. For sure, the fresh sound of last
summer was a welcome addition to the dry
market of the time, but now all the songs sound the
same. It was as if the contents of ‘‘The Little Girls
Understand”’ was the second of a two record set
that contained ‘‘Get The Knack.”’

The Knack are a marketing wonder and a real
success on tour due to their faithful audience of ad-
ditive engorged eighth grade female types.
Something that does escape me is the appeal that
the absolutely stupid lyrics have to this audience,
because if not degrading, the lyrics are at least the
caliber of eleven year old bathroom jokes. The
cover art and accompanying liner photograph
show pretty much what the Knack is about. On
front, there is a picture of a very young girl look-

ing up knowingly at a street lamp and a group shot
on the back with self-indulgent banter printed with
the idea that the Knack are the future of rock. The
inner sleeve is a panorama of the backseat of a
limosine with the four members of the band wav-
ing to a mob of young girls on the outside. So much
for the Knack-this may be their last album.

Tom Petty provides an excellent example of a
quality product with an ‘A plus” rating all
around. At first, it is not hard to imagine that
‘‘Refugee”’ or ‘‘Don’t Do Me Like That”’ could be
the only stars on the album, because usually we
don’t find a record with more than one or two
great songs. Be prepared for both sides of Petty’s
latest ‘‘Damn The Torpedoes’’ because they are
non-stop rock at its pre-new wave best.

Petty is a veteran of the recording industry,
with several albums to his credit, including the
last one which sponsored ‘‘Breakdown,”’ a minor
AM radio hit. ‘‘Torpedoes”’ is proof the rock and
roll with the British roots of Dave Clark and the
American innovation of Chuck Berry is still alive
and rocking. Besides the two I have mentioned,
my other picks for hits on ‘‘Torpedoes’’ are ‘‘Even
the Losers” and ‘‘Century City’’ but all of them
are good. There will be many more albums from
Tom Petty, but this effort is well worth a listen.

Notes: Linda Lovelace is going to record an
erotic selection from her own poetry for sale to
discos as accompanyment for instrumentals, . . .
Linda Ronstadt’s new album is out and it is much
more rock then ever before. . . Graham Nash’s
new album lacks the direction of his other work
and wallows in lyrics of personal nature and inside
jokes not too enjoyable-so what?. . . Response to
Gary Numan’s performance on Saturday Night
was so great that added concert dates and an ex-
tension of the tour was planned.

friends with the horse. He is
rescued and returns home
where he meets up with an old
farmer, Mickey Rooney, who
just happens to have been a big
man in the world of horse rac-
ing. The plot doesn’t really
thicken much as the boy decides
to race “‘the Black’’ and trains
toward that end. The climatic
race that followsis admirable in
its resistance to follow the lines
of ‘Rocky.’ That climactic
scene is aS equally well show
and as evenly paced as the rest
of the film and completes a
technically well composed pic-
ture.

The only complaint I can
muster is in regard to a certain
looseness in the story and a
slight inconsistancy in em-
phasis. The scenes of the boy
and the horse castaway on the

idyllic island are enchanting in °

their power to evoke raw, inno-
cent emotions. The friendship
between the boy and horse is
carefully cultivated by the
director, and the result is
scense of uncompromising sen-
sitivity. Moments that could
easily become tear jerkers or
pure corn are masterfully

managed. One of the best
scenes is one which the boy
woos the horse into allowing to
be ridden is cleverly shot in the
form of an underwater waltz
with nothing but legs and ocean
floor.

But the second half of the
film, after the rescue, does not
follow through with the develop-
ment of the deep friendship bet-
ween boy and horse that was
established on the island. The
concern with training and rac-
ing seems to be in the way of the
fun of the island days. An old
farm hand, in a scene that
seems to pretend profundity,
suggests that the horse’s soul
suffers as long as he is not free.
Nothing comes of this unex-
pected indictment, because the
horse continues to train and
finally races. During the race
there are flash backs to the
island, perhaps suggesting
either that racing is a form of
play for the horse or that he
yearns for the days long gone.
After the race, the end of the
movie, the link is unclear and
troublesome, despite the open
ending to the story.

Business As Usual

by Bill Whalen

50 miles up I-81 sits University Hall, otherwise
known as ‘The House That Ralph Built.’’ Now surely
you’ve heard of this building. In December and early
January, it was a powerhouse as the Virginia
Cavaliers were ranked in the top ten.

The only problem was that the house rested on some
rather weak timbers and, the whole edifice came
crashing down recently, landing as low as fifth in the
ACC. ;

Meanwhile, there sat another house in the town of
Lexington. This house also supposedly had strong
support, but, as the season progressed, it too. almost
fell victim to a collapse.

But there the story ends. For as the Virginia
Cavaliers exit stage left, fighting and squabbling all
the way, their neighbors, the Washington & Lee
Generals, will remain on the stage for at least two en-
core performances.

If you haven’t heard by now, the Generals captured
the ODAC Tournament last weekend by defeating
three teams in three consecutive nights. Of course, all
of this is even more impressive when one realizes that
the Generals won the championship game by beating
Hampden-Sydney on Sydney’s home court.

In the meanwhile, the Cavaliers will travel to
Greensboro, where they too will probably have to beat
three teams in three straight nights to qualify for the
postseason playoffs.

The only difference between the two teams is that
the Cavaliers will probably fail where the Generals
have succeeded. And the reason for this is that U.Va.
and W&L have two entirely different philosophies
toward athletics.

Take the game of basketball, for example.

At W&L, the sport has been placed in the confines of
Division III regulations, where scholarships are
outlawed. While the players are good, there is more of
an emphasis on academics (at least ideally there is).

Virginia could also promote the ‘“‘academic’”’ aspect
of its program — at least until it started to be known
as “Ralph’s House.” If the Cavaliers are guilty
of anything, they are guilty of turning their basketball
program into a business.

And that is why the University of Virginia is having
such problems. Because of increased pressures from
its fans and financiers, Virginia has to go out and
stomp each of its business rivals (otherwise known as
the rest of the ACC). And so far, all the Cavaliers have
done is stub their toe, rather than stomp anybody.

Let’s face it, when sports become a business, they
just aren’t fun to play. Why else would so many pro-
fessional players be willing to retire at such young

Grapplers Place Second
In ODAC Tournament

by Chris Sisto
The varsity wrestling team
finished out the season last
week with the ODAC champion-
ships at Hampden-Sydney. The
Generals came in second place

with 40 3/4 points and had three

-weight class champions.

Lynchburg College came in
first place with 59 points.
Rouding out the rest of the
teams were Hampden-Sydney
in third with 38 3/4 points and
Maryville finishing last with
nine points.

This is the first time in the
four year tournament history
that the Generals did not come
in first place. The three first
place finishers for the Generals
were Captain Ray Gross at 142
Ibs., senior Ed Rodgers at 158
Ibs., and junior Les Heart at 167
Ibs.

Gross’ win in the final, which
was a 7-0 shutout, was the
fourth time in a row he has won
his weight class. He was also
named the tournament’s Most
Valuable Wrestler.

Said Franke, “The young
wrestlers just couldn’t pick up
the void left by the injuries to
Mike McFadden and Dave
Stoeffel.”” Franke did however

  

i

Ray Gross
have praise for his seniors this
year.

“Joe Wallace at unlimited
and Stoeffel at 167 lbs., did a
fine job for us here,’ said
Franke. And, of course, you
have Rodgers who was a great
leader and Gross who is the win-
ningest wrestler in Washington
& Lee history.”

Gross had a 19-3 overall
record this year and over eighty
wins in his four year career at
the school.

‘Rodger’s win, a 13-1 decision,
avenged a loss in the finals of
the tournament last year to the
current runner-up. Heart’s vic-
tory, a close 14-12 march, was
also the first ODAC title for
him.

 

The Generals finished out
their dual meet season with a
disappointing 3-7 record. They
closed out the year with losses
to George Washington (38-9)
and James Madison (39-12).
The team’s only win came
against Davidson College
(38-18).

The second place finish for
the Generals was not a surprise
for Head Coach Gary Franke,
however, ‘“The team did as well
as expected since there have
been so many injuries in the
lineup, I was, however, pleased

-and surprised by the first place

finish of Les Heart.”’

Franke feels that the main
reason for the team’s first los-
ing record in seven years was
the fact that of the wrestlers
called upon to replace those in-
—" many were inexperienc-

As for the future Franke is
somewhat skeptical about next
season, feeling that the team
has a lot of work to do because
of the graduation of four seniors
and the lack of experience of the
young wrestlers on the roster.

‘‘We have a ways to go, but
I'm fairly optimistic about next
year”

scouting as usual,’’ said Can-
field. ‘‘We stayed with our man-
to-man defense, yet were spur-
red on by _ individual _ per-
formances, such as Scaggs and
Hanson (freshman forward)
gave.”

W&L next faced Eastern
Mennonite’s Royals, a team
which had beaten the Generals
twice during the regular
season. This time it was dif-
ferent as the Generals received
incredible offensive  per-
formances from three ‘‘blues.”’

Smitherman did it all, scoring
22 points and collecting 14 re-
bounds. “‘Robbie’s shooting and
scoring potential has increased
dramatically this year,
especially in the latter part of
the season,” said Canfield.

Jeffries was close behind,
scoring 21 points and grabbing 6
rebounds. The game’s leading
scorer, however, was Clark
New. New scored 24 points,
halfof which came on foul shots,
a major reason why three of
Eastern Mennonite’s starters
fouled out.

Hanson and Scaggs con-
tributed six and eight points,
respectively, yet provided the
defense which, for example,
helped hold the Royal’s guard

Timmy Crawford to 17 points
(Crawford scored 33 points in
Mennonite’s previous win over
W&L).

Comments Canfield: ‘‘All
season long, Hanson and
especially Scaggs, have
sacrificed their offense in order
to concentrate to a greater ex-
tent on defense.’’ As a result,

W&L rolled to a 95-84 victory
over Mennonite and earned the
chance to play Hampden-
Sydney in the finals.

There was Sydney, the home
team, gaining the chance to
play in the O.D.A.C. finals
against W&L, a team it had split
with during the regular season
but had beaten previously at
home, 62-58, in an emotion-
packed game.

But the Generals, as Canfield
said, “believed.”” “The squad
believed in what they could ac-
complish together.”’

It showed.

Down 30-27 at halftime, the
Generals battled back to tie the
score at 56-all with half a
minute left. A missed H-S shot
gave W&L the ball as the clock
ran down to four seconds and
the Generals called time-out.

Comments Canfield, ‘‘Our
plan was to free Robbie
(Smitherman) at the top of the
key and let him shoot.” With 6-6
Ed Owens in his face, Smither-
man arched the 18-foot jumper
home and a stunned Hampden-
Sydney crowd watched their
team fall just short, 58-56, to the
Generals, the new champions.

Smitherman and Spears led
all scorers with 16 points each,
followed by Jeffries with 15.

Once again, W&L’s defense,
sparked by Scaggs and Hanson,
held two Tiger stars under their
season scoring averages. Drew
Payne was held to a team high
12 points (his average was 17)
and Ed Owens held to eight
points (his average was 14).

The Sydney victory gave
W&L a season record over .500
(14-13) for the first time since

Bernot Is Leader Of

Swim Team’s Hopes

by Kip Gordon

They have given up their
winter break in order to prac-
tice, and they will devote their
time this weekend not to the
festivities on campus, but
rather to competition in the
Virginia state meet in Norfolk.
They are the W&L swimmers,
and the amount of time which
they must sacrifice to their
sport is stunning.

Now consider the sport of
swimming itself. Weight train-
ing and countless laps in a pool
are the basic components for
improvement. In other words,
the only way to get better in this
sport is by inflicting pain and p
sical (as well as mental) fatigue
on one’s own body. Why do they
do it?

Sophomore Mike Bernot put it
this way, ‘‘For me the ultimate
goal is to find out just how fast I
can swim. Right now I really
don’t know what my limits are,
and unless I continue swimming
I’ll never find out.”

For Bernot more immediate
goals are presently within his
grasp as he has already
qualified for the Division III
NCAA meet in two events (the
50 and 100 yard freestyles), and
has a strong shot at All-
American honors. He is cur-
rently ranked among the top ten
Division III swimmers in these
events.

Freshman Ken Johnstone, a
sprint specialist, will swim the
50 and 100 yard freestyles and
the 100 yard breast stroke.
Remillard expects his best
showing to come in the 50 and
100 yard freestyles.

Senior captain Bob Newcomb
will be swimming the 50, 100
and 200 yard freestyle events,

and Remillard feels he is
strongest in the 50 and the 100.

Sophomore Herb Gresens will
swim the 100, 200 and 500 yard
freestyles. Remillard predicts
his qualifying threats will come
in the 100 and 200 yard events.

The four swimmers will also
swim three relay events, and,
accordmg to Remillard, the
four-man squad is all but
guaranteed to qualify for na-
tionals in the 400 yard freestyle,

and are strong contenders in the

800 yard freestyle.

But so far Bernot is the only
W&L swimmer to qualify for
the national meet. In order to
qualify for the nationals a
swimmer must beat a standard
time set for his event.

Three other swimmers still
have a chance to qualify and
have set their sights for this
weekend’s state meet. Of these
swimmers, Coach Page Re-
millard said, ‘‘They’re all
swimming very well right now
and I’m confident they’ll all
qualify for nationals. I’m not
sure how the other teams will do
at the state meet, so for our pur-
poses we will be competing
against the clock
weekend.”’

For Mike Bernot the meet will
decide whether he competes in
the NCAA’s in two or three
events. But, for the others, it is
now a matter of making it to the
national meet at all. As Coach
Remillard said, ‘‘Again, they
should all qualify — physically
they have what it takes so it
may be a matter of mental
preparation. But I’m confident
they’ll all be ready — they’ve
given up se much for the chance
to compete at the nationals.”

ages? And why are the Cavalier ball players com-
plaining? Because they’re not having any fun, either.
So when Terry Holland tries to find the culprit for
all his team’s woes, maybe he should look in his own
backyard instead of pointing his finger at his players
or the press. Holland should rightly blame the alumni,

fans and the university’s administration for turning

the UVA basketball program into a conglomerate.

And if you’re not having fun as a Wahoo, Ralph,
then maybe you’d prefer to play ball in Lexington
next year? I think you’d have a good time playing

basketball at W&L.

You can even leave you Snisdeetene’s suit at

Student Control Committee
Chairman Tim Brooks question-
ed the reasoning behind the mo-
tion.

“If different faculty members
have different attitudes, I do not
see where there is unity in the
spirit of. the motion,’”’ said
Brooks.

Junior UC _ Representative
Jeff Bartlett said no one had hit
home on the problem.

Dr. Frednick L. Schwab said
there is a problem which the
students should solve.

Schwab said fraternities have
solved many of their own pro-
blems already, but added, ‘‘the
students should do a better job
in this area.”

Brooks said he still did not
think the area in which the pro-
blems exist had been defined.

He said the Student Affairs
Committee did a report on
academics and fraternities
which is conclusive.

Brooks did not say what the
report concludes, but he hinted

The Ring-tum Phi, February 28, 1980, Page 7

Mid-Week Parties, Bands Attacked

that fraternities are following
the no-weeknight-party rule in
letter.

“I don’t think the faculty
should disclaim the report
simply ‘because they don’t
agree with it,”’ Brooks said

Dr. John M. Evans said that
one house, whioh could not par-
ty for awhile because it was on
social probation, rose from fif-
teenth to fifth in overall
academic standing.

He added that attendance and
preparation is better on
Tuesdays than it is on
Thursdays, after parties,

Spontaneity of parties was
also discussed at length at the
UC meeting.

“I think there is a big dif-
ference between a fraternity
party and the getting together
on a free night of several peo-
ple,” said Evans.

Evans said he is not opposed

the UC mid-week parties do not
accomplish any good.

At this point of the meeting
Dr. Philip L. Cline called the
question and made a motion to
ban live music from fraternities
during the the week.

The measure was defeated
13-5, with one abstention.

Before the meeting was over
however, Dr. Robert A.
Roberts made several com-
ments.

“The problem here is with
perception, you once found that
fraternities were actively sup-

porting their members in
becoming educated,’’ Roberts
said.

Roberts told the UC the
dissatisfaction is real, as is the
concern.

‘The faculty may be forced to
take some action they may be
reluctant to take,’ Roberts
said.

Roberts also said that dif-
ferent fraternities’ records are
mixed, yet that the perception
of fraternities and not their
records is the problem.

Actor To

Speak
Next Week

Ossie Davis — renowned as
an actor and playwright for
more than 30 years — will be the
guest of Washington and Lee
University next Wednesday,
Mar. 5, for a public lecture and
reception as part of the Student
Association for Black Unity’s
annual ‘‘Black Emphasis
Week.”’

His lecture, scheduled for 8
p.m. in the Warner Center of the
Washington and Lee gym-
nasium, will include dramatic
performances centering on the
development of black American
culture from slavery through
the present.

Davis is the author of three
plays — ‘‘Alice in Wonder,”
“Last Dance for Sybil’? and
‘‘Purlie Victorious,’’ his best-
known work, which opened on
Broadway in 1962.

He is most familiar to the
public, however, as an actor,
with dozens of roles to his
credit. He began his career with
the Rose McClendon Players or
Harlem, and after service with
the U.S. Army in World War II,
became a featured player on
Broadway in such plays as
Mare Connelly’s ‘‘Green
Pastures,’’ Lorraine
Hansbury’s ‘‘A Raisin in the
Sun,” ‘“‘The Wisteria Trees,”’ in
which he appeared with Helen
Hayes, and the musical

ington beginning at 8p.m.

Ending the week’s activities
will be the traditional ball for
students and their guests in
Evans Hall on Saturday even-
ing, Mar. 8. Music for the dance
will be provided by ‘‘Standing
Room Only”’ of Richmond.

“Black Emphasis Week”’ is a
project of W&L’s Student
Association for Black Unity
(SABU), and friends of the
university as well as faculty,
students and staff are en-
couraged to participate in all
the events. Established in 1972,
the week of events is designed
‘to bring to the cemmunity’s at-
tention some of the many ac-
complishment’s, idiosyncrasies
and problems of blacks in
America today.”

the first of a series of ap-

author and director — another
first in his career.

In addition to acting and
writing, Davis is active as an
educational lecturer and civil-
rights worker. He received the
award for meritorious service
given annually by the Congres-
sional Black Caucus in 1972 for
his work on behalf of the under-
privileged, and is a member of

but that they were unwritten,”
said Vines to the EC.

In one incident Vines related
to the EC, a member of the ‘‘cli-
que’ which frequently uses the
SELC got a loan to buy a new
transmission for his car.

Vines said members of the
group still come to him fre-
quently and constitute 95 per-
cent of the SELC’s business.

After explaining .how one
group has monopolized the
SELC, Vines made several sug-
gestions to remedy the situa-
tion.

He told the EC that persons
who did not repay their loan
within 30 days should pay a
small daily interest on their
loan.

Vines also said he wanted the
power to grant $50 loans
himself, but that the power to
give loans greater that than $50
should rest with the four-
member committee.

The Committee is composed
of two members of the Cold

Check Committee and two
members of the Student Control
Committee.

Though all members of the
Committee are to be present at
emergency loan meetings, ac-
cording to the Committee’s
policies as stated in the student
handbook, Vines said when he
took over the Committee it was
policy for small loans to be
given out by the chairman.

Loans are not always paid
back within 30 days, as required
in the SELC’s statement of
policies, Vines said.

Vines also told the EC that the
emergency loans are not funded
through fines levied by the SCC,
as stated in the Committee’s
policy, but that loans come
from the EC’s reserve fund.

ed discussion and voting on the

suggested be divided into three
parts.

Willis agreed and his first mo-
tion was that the Chairman be
allowed to grant $50 loans if he
reported the loans to the EC
once a month. The motion also
called for persons needing loans
larger than $50 to approach the
whole Committee.

The motion failed by a 9-2
margin, and Ould and Jay
Blumberg, Senior Represen-
tative, said the EC should con-
sider the SELC’s size and com-
position.

Junior Rrepresentative
Bruce Poole suggested the
Committee be enlarged to in-
clude six members, with four
members making a quorum.
Poole said the EC should select
the members at large from the
student body.

The motion passed 7-4, but
was replaced by a later vote
which charged the SELC to five
members, and eliminated the
two SCC representatives.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Leiters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Party Problem

Once again the faculty is dissatisfied with the
fraternities and their mid-week partying. And once
again the actual problems perceived by the faculty
are only vaguely defined—issues, when presented,
are not addressed but skirted.

The complaint this time is that while the “‘letter of
the law”’ is being obeyed, the ‘‘spirit”’ is not—or so the
faculty says. Parties are still being held during the
week at fraternity houses and the faculty is restive
about the situation. However, the problems the facul-
ty claimed it was trying to solve have been solved;
this further action only demonstrates that the pro-
blems the faculty said it was addressing were not the
real problems the faculty had in mind.

Consider the problems put forth last year:
—Noise during the week is no longer a problem;
—Police confrontations during the week are no longer
a problem (as evidenced by the decline in arrests and
complaints for noise violations);
—The feeling of compulsory attenda ce to protect
financial interests, which seemed a major concern of
those pushing for tbe party ban, has been eliminated
by changes in the financing of parties—now only those
students who wish to party pay.

The notion of enhancing the academic atmosphere
on campus by legislating conduct is as absurd as at-
tempting to legislate morality. A set of rules does not
change attitude.

Spontaneous parties are acceptable, says another,
and the planned party is not spontaneous. But a stu-
dent who is in control of his work load ean determine
whether he can budget his work and plan a night off,
or part of a night off, and which night it will be. Those
who cannot judge their schedules are going to get in
trouble no matter what the temptations.

The faculty apparently perceives a problem in
academic attitude but is focusing attempts to change
the attitude on the wrong issues. The problems caused
vy the mid-week parties as defined by the faculty last
year have been solved. Until other real problems can
be defined and addressed, and the causes of the pro-
blems determined, further attempts at legislating
student conduct is unjustified and can be likened to
the wild swingings of a man with a stick who hears a
noise in the dark.

The faculty is challenged, then, to present solid
arguments and justification for its actions that affect
student liberties. Let it define a specific problem,
justify its reasoning for selecting the focus of the pro-
blem, and explain just how the action will solve the
problem. This is the only way intelligent men make
decisions.

Students and faculty both must be constantly aware
of the problem of misperceptions surrounding the
‘ssues. All actions or considerations by the faculty
concerning fraternities are not an attempt to close
them down or destroy student freedoms. But not all
the problems of attitude and atmosphere on campus
are rooted in fraternity functions. If both sides would
keep these basic concepts in mind then perhaps the
problems that do exist can be solved in a proper man-
ner,

And yes, we know the faculty has the power and the
authority to rule over student life. But shouldn’t it at
least consider that students also have a legitimate
claim on the choices of their lives? Study halls might
be a solution to the problem, but should a college
become a prep school?

Faculty
Theft

Situation

Cleared Up

Dear Editor:

I would like to take this op-
portunity to lay to rest my re-
cent allegation that a faculty
member stole my watch.

I had originally wanted to
avoid pursuing the matter due
to personal reasons.

However, I felt there existed
a responsibility to the student
body and to the other segments
of the University to point out
what appeared to be an honor
violation — thus, I wrote to the
Phi concerning my experience.

My letter precipitated an in-
vestigation by the administra-
tion in which I agreed to take
part.

Let me state that the matter
has been looked into, both to my
satisfaction and to that of the
administration.

No honor violation did, in
fact, occur. Circumstances
were such that I honestly
believed a theft had occurred,
but this was definitely not the
case.

Mullins Replies To Charges

Dear Editor:

In his vitrolic letter, replying
to my charges, Mr. White called
me a liar, accused me of
violating the honor system, of
juvenile behavior and of
ethnocentricism. Since the only
point in my letter which he
disputed is the amount of the fee
paid Carmichael, this must be
the cause of my naughtiness.

I could be wrong as to the ex-
act dollar amount, but I was
told $2000 by a faculty member
and it will take the word of a
better man than Mr. White to
convince me that I am wrong.
Even if the fee were less than
$2000, the basic premise of Car-
michael the revolutionary
engaging in _ capitalist
endeavors still stands.

The other points were
unrefuted by Mr. White. Indeed,
when he insists on calling Car-
michael ‘‘Brother Kwame
Toure,’’ he shows the same sort
of attitude as Carmichael,
posturing as some keep while
enjoying all the advantages ac-
cruing to an American.

Mr. White was worried about
my letter ‘‘imperiling the tran-
quility of the campus communi-
ty,” presumably by causing
racial strife. We are fortunate
at W&L in having so few
negroes that there is no danger
of that.

Mr. White may write that
“SABU will not be dictated to’’
but, as an organization funded

by the University, it remains:

open to comments from Editor's Note: Mr. White is not a

students and faculty. And, any
faculty member who accuses a
student of creating an outright
lie should be able to prove his
claim. If, as is the case with Mr.
White, he cannot, he should be
dismissed from the faculty.

ty Affairs.

arts of Mr. Mullin’s letter were
deleted beeause the editors felt
the language used was offensive
and inappropriate.

From The Editor’s Desk

Thoughts On Fancy Dress

The EC might have kept the price of Fancy Dress tickets for the
student body at last year’s prices, but if you’re dealing on the open
market you’re in trouble.

The latest report we’ve heard is that FD tickets are selling on the
black market for as much as $40. We’re not sure who would pay
such an outrageous price but one scalper explained that ‘‘when
some alumnus brings his wife all the way from Atlanta, he’ll pay
any price to go to the dance.”

We'll have to see...

At least two W&L seniors started the weekend early—on Monday.
One of them was admitted into law school and thought an ap-
propriate celebration would be to fly to Wyoming to visit a friend.

Of course no one believed they would actually do such a crazy and
expensive thing—until they phoned from Atlanta enroute.

The latest word is that Wyoming is even more boring than Lex-
ington and they will return in time for all the parties before tom-
morrow’s dance...

One of the unreported tidbits about the Big Dance is that W&L
didn’t get sued. You see, Parker Brothers has a copyright on their
Monopoly game which they invoke whenever they get wind of so-
meone using their game for other purposes. The object isn’t to get
more money but to stop the exploitation of their product.

Apparently, one of W&L’s distinguished lawyers told the SAB to
go ahead because they are a non-profit organization. Of course an
untimely suit would have ruined FD. Maybe it’s a good thing the
SAB isn’t making the $8,000 profit on the dance they had originally
planned for... othe nag gn

The Politics of Afghanistan

Public apathy as is illustrated by low voter tur-
nouts has characterized our electoral process
throughout the 70’s. In the past few months
however, international crises in Iran and
Afghanistan have sharply focused public attention
on the: 1980 Presidential race. Although it is
reassuring to see that the public has become more
willing to take an active role in our political pro-
cess, these international crises have diverted
public attention from the most significant issues
with which Americans have been preoccupied
since 1976, inflation and energy.

In fact, the inability of our nation to decrease its
dependence on foreign oil is precisely the reason
why the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan poses a
threat to our security. If the United States had laid
aside partisan interests and developed an energy
policy which could reduce our dependence on Per-
sian Gulf oil, the urgency and tension surrounding
the Afghanistan invasion would not be nearly as
great as is now evident. In President Carter’s own
terms, ‘‘world peace’ would not be so gravely en-
dangered.

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan indirectly
brings into focus the United States’ most pressing
domestic problem, double digit inflation. This con-
temporary round of inflation has two major com-
ponents — energy consumption and the federal
government’s deficit spending. Our dependence
on external sources of oil has forced the Ad-
ministration to greatly increase defense spending,
thereby expanding the federal deficit and adding
to the already great inflationary pressures.

Before the 1973 oil embargo, the United States
paid $6 Billion for imported oil. In 1980 it is
estimated that the U.S. will pay $100 Billion for im-
ported oil. Over the next five years, the U.S. will
pay $500 Billion to OPEC. The U.S. cannot even
hope to effectively combat inflation if we are to
continue to pay this excise tax to the OPEC na-
tions. Moreover, the military and foreign aid ex-
penditures that will be necessary to safeguard our
sources of oil will only increase deficit spending
and aggravate the inflationary spiral. Therefore,
the most significant way in which the United
States can guarantee its security and help reduce
inflationary pressures is by creating a serious
energy policy which can dramatically reduce U:S.
dependence on foreign oil.

Not only have the Iranian and Afghanistan
crises exposed our weak and dependent energy
situation, they have dramatically changed the for-
tunes of the Democratic presidential candidates.
The international crises havehad little discernible
effect on the Republican race. President Carter
has utilized these crises as a rallying point for his
campaign and has been quite effective in doing so.

The resurrection of the Carter campaign can be
directly attributed to what the public perceives as
skillful handling of the international situation by
the President. More specifically the President has
assumed a popular hard-line stance toward the
Russians after theinvasion of Afghanistan. The
President has denied the Russians American
grain, technology transfers, cultural exchanges
and has called for a boycott of the Summer Olym-
pics to be held in Moscow.

The Administration’s foreign policy has
transformed from a three year old policy of ac-
commodation to one which resembles the ‘‘Dulles
policy of containment,’’ as is manifest by the
strengthening of ties to China and offers of aid to
Pakistan, India and Turkey. These reactionary
Carter policies are a direct outgrowth of the

heightening frustration of the American public in —

an election year, a public frustrated by the im-
punity with which terrorists hold Americans
hostage in Iran, the inability of the U.S. to restrain
OPEC price increases, the declining value of the
working man’s wages and the blatant Soviet
disrespect for international laws.

The President’s recent show of strength against
the challenge posed by Senator Kennedy
demonstrates the effectiveness with which the
President has used the crises to deflect criticism
of the policies of his first three years in office.

This recent foreign policy shift starkly contrasts
with the President’s previous record and perhaps
his very essence as a man. The President has ask-
ed Congress for a substantial increase in defense
expenditures, has tabled consideration of Salt II
(temporarily), has proposed the development of a
rapid development force thereby increasing
American military presence abroad, and has call-
ed for reinstatement of draft registration for men.
He has also appealed to Congress to include
Women in draft registration.

No measure smacks of political maneuver as
does the reinstatement of draft registration. The
President claims that it is a gesture of American
resolve to restrain Soviet expansion. In essence it
is an astute political move to convey to the
American people that Carter is a firm and resolute
leader. Moreover, by recommending to Congress
that women be included in the draft, the President
has appealed to the sensibilities of ERA sup-
porters, while leaving the political hot potato in
the hands of Congress. Since passage of a Congres-
sional amendment to include women in draft
registration is unlikely, Carter will not lose sup-
port from either supporters or opponents of ERA.

Moreover, there appears to be little numerical
need for the draft at the present time. The army is

More On
Mullin Letter

Dear Editor:

About John L. White’s
response to David Mullin, I
have a few words.

I believe it’s a well known fact
that on this campus, lying is a
very serious offense. So much
so, that accuasations of lying
should never be made lightly.

For this reason, if White is go-
ing to charge Mullin with lying,
he had better be willing to
substantiate his claim. In his
letter he does not.

In fact, he himself seems to
be confused as to whether
Mullin is guilty of lying, or is
merely mistaken. There exists
a great difference between the
two.

Moreover, White’s con-
spicuous omission of the actual
cost of Carmichael’s speaking
engagement gives his whole
argument a rather insincere
ring.

I propose that we all learn
from White that irresponsible
criticism is never a very good
rebuttal of irresponsible
criticism.

KNO COULD §E VALUAB- ets Dear Editor:
I was greatly taken aback

when I read the letter of Mr.
Brian Ginsburg printed in the
Ring-tum Phi of February 14,
1980 (Vol. LXXIX, Number,19).
I publically ask Mr. Ginsburg
two questions. Firstly, who has
appointed you, above everyone,
to decide which posters on cam-
pus are garbage? Secondly,
what possible right do you have
to take down anybody’s
posters?

Mr. Ginsburg, you were of-
fended by the fact that the
posters were unsigned. Sir, this
pales into insignificance com-
pared to your conduct. You
have taken it upon yourself to
decide what views will be heard
and then deliberately suppress-
ed what you don’t like. If the YD
and CRs can post political
posters, then everyone can,
regardless of whatever you
think. Furthermore, I believe
that you owe a public apology to
those who authorized the
posters you removed and to the
University community as a
whole for disgracing this liberal
arts institution.

Unfortunately, conduct like
yours has happened before and
will probably happen again.
During the election of 1932, the
Nazis often would take down the
posters of the opposition.
Perhaps if the SA still existed,
you could do this professionally.

Gary Langan Goodenow, ’80

Dear Editor:

To Mr. Brian Ginsburg, who,

last issue, attempted so
presumptuously to detend nis

misdeeds with some anti-draft
posters. I have the following
things to say.

First, the attachment, in a
non-damaging manner, of
posters and notices on the walls
is presently the most effective
means of general inter-student
communication available on
campus. It makes possible a
whole host of necessary univer-
sity activities from private and
commercial transactions to
campus events and activity op-
tions to the broader field of in-
telectual and political issues
that have a bearing on the lives
of a significant number of W&L
students. Granted that this
function could be fulfilled more
efficiently (say by the strategic
placement of large covered sur-
faces specifically designated
for such communications);
nonetheless, it is a tool that has
become valuable to many in-
dividuals and student groups
alike as well as helping to
cultivate the active and con-
troversial intellectual environ-
ment which is cardinal to any
academic institution.

Second, and of greatest im-
port, is the fact that neither the
notices nor the walls were Mr.

Key To Pres. Election

not having trouble maintaining the number of new
recruits to fill the volunteer army. Rather the real
problem is that the reserve is greatly shorthanded
and not enough experienced and skilled soldiers
are choosing to re-enlist. Since 1972, the purchas-
ing power of military personnel has declined
dramatically. As a stop-gap measure, a bill is
before Congress which will increase the pay of
military personnel 3.41 percent in excess on the
annual increase which will be given to all federal
employees. This bill is indicative ofthe need to
make the pay of military personnel competitive
with private industry in order to help induce the
re-enlistment of skilled personnel. Reinstatement
of the draft or draft registration Will not solve this
problem.

Thus it seems that President Carter is allowing
political consideration to influence his responses
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Presi-
dent is using the crisis to shift attention from the
inflation rate which grew during his term from an
“unacceptable’’ 6 percent in 1976 to the highest
peacetime inflation rate since immediately after
WW ILat 13.3 percent in 1979.

Moreover, Carter’s hard line stance toward the
Soviets and increased defense spending stands in

contrast to his decisions to cancel the development

of the neutron bomb and the B-1 bomber and the
Administration’s original 1976 campaign goal of
total nuclear disarmament. The Carter Ad-
ministration’s failures in gaining a consensus on
the windfall profits tax or practically any energy
legislation now seem equally remote from the
public’s attention.

Thus the international situation has rallied the
nation behind the President much to the dismay of
Senator Kennedy and Governor Brown. The initial
stumbling and subsequent deflation of the Ken-
nedy campaign has forced the Senator to
definitively take a stand on the controversial
energy issue. Kennedy has stated that he endorses
the use of either gas rationing or a stiff excise tax
on gas in order to reduce consumption and
dependence on oil imports. This solution is
perhaps the only means of immediately reducing
the nation’s consumption of oil.

Either measure is harsh and likely to be un-
popular in an election year. An increase in the tax
on gasoline will provide money for development of
alternate sources of energy and will make other
fuels more competitive with gas. A high tax on
gas, however, will place an undue burden on the
poor, who have already been devastated by
unabated inflation. Gas rationing is a more
equitable means of reducing consumption but any
absolute restriction placed on the amount of fuel a
person can use is also likely to be unpopular.

Although Senator Kennedy appears to be grop-
ing for issues in which he can oppose the Presi-
dent, he has decided to remain in the race for the
duration. Even though Kennedy was beaten in
New Hampshire, the Senator realizes that the
volatile international situation could work to his
advantage as quickly and decisively as it has for
Carter.

All Jerry Brown can do is watch with anguish as
Carter rides this recent crest of his popularity.

 

Brown’s highly publicized flip-flop on the Proposi-
tion 13 issue following its passage has given the
Governor a credibility problem. Brown’s only
chance to become a serious challenger for the
Democratic nomination was to score heavily in a
public debate against Carter and Kennedy.

The nation’s mood seems to be shifting toward
the right — away from the progressive stance with
which Brown is usually associated. Since Carter
now finds it expedient to run a Rose Garden cam-
paign and avoid a public debate, Brown has little
hope of establishing himself as a candidate with a
serious chance to capture the nomination.

Hollins Replies
To Bill Leachman

Dear Mr. Leachman:

I read with great interest your letter to the
Hollins Columns and feel a reply is definitely in
order.

In addition to the expense of gas for the trip
twice a week to and from Lexington, we also incur
other minor monetary setbacks, including board-
ing houses for weekend dates and coffee or No-
Doze to keep us awake on the trip back. But
seriously, we are not really concerned with the
petty point of who spends more money. .

Although most of the other schools in the area
have facilities capable of handling large crowds
with little or no danger of destruction to property,
we at Hollins do not. Our choices are either to have
private parties, outdoor parties, impossible until
later inthe spring, or parties in the Rathskeller.

Expenses incurred in Rathskeller parties in-
clude security, entertainment, and damage
deposits. For every 100 people attending a party
on the Hollins campus there must be one security
guard. Each officer is paid $22.50 for a three hour
period. In addition to the 1 per 100 ratio indoors,
there are a number of guards outdoors for traffic
control, also paid the same amount.

While most fraternities have a brother who pro-

’ vides music or a music system belonging to the

house, we have no such facilities; therefore we
must hire someone to serve us in this capacity. An
average charge for this service would be between
$25 and $50 per hour.

For any party on this campus, a damage deposit
must be paid. For parties over a certain number of
people or which are held in certain places, this
deposit is not wholly refundable.

Also, the Rathskeller, although on property own-
ed by the college, is maintained under separate
management and has the right to charge for the
beer they serve. Our cover charges, too, are paid
by everyone.

I resent the tone implied in your letter, but as
this is a factual rebuttal, I shall not breach this
subject. Suffice to say that your letter was not one
of the more pleasant things I have read.

In closing I wish to say that I hope I have helped
to clarify some of our reasons behind our cover
charge policy.

Ginsburg’s property. In addi-
tion, Mr. Ginsburg is no official
representative of the Universi-
ty. Therefore this makes Mr.
Ginsburg guilty of vandalism
and theft of private property,
which is an honor code violation
anda crime.

At such time as_ legal
representatives of Washington
and Lee University ownership
request that its property be kept
clear of all such literature (as is
and ought to be the perogative
of ownership) I, for one, will
cease this practice. But until
such time, I not-so-respectfully
request that Mr. Ginsburg and
associates discontinue their
criminal activities and allow
the free individuals of this
university to peacefully conduct
their affairs, unharrassed.

C. K. Sawyer ’83°

Dear Editor:

I am basically a tolerant per-
son about most things written or
spoken (i.e. I am usually too
shiftless to react to anything I
see, read, or hear). But the
repugnance of Brian Ginsburg’s
letter, written to the Editors

before vacation, extends
beyond my tolerance and com-
pels me to react.

First of all, his logic stinks.
Those signs were not an attack

~ on General Westmoreland but a

simple statement of political
principles. Those people behind
the signs were not cowards.
They identified themselves by
wearing black armbands on the

day of Westmoreland’s speech.

 

Finally the act itself, and the
Spasmotic sanctimony that
motivated it, repugns my sen-
sibilities as an American. In our
views, Ginsburg and I agree. I
want to see the economic,
political and military vigilance
of the United States restored to
the levels of the pre-Vietnam
sixties. But we conservatives
obviously have nor cornered the
market on brains. Other valid
views exist and ought to be ar-
ticulated. I, like Ginsburg, want
to see the sovereign integrity of
the republic maintained against
the external threat posed by the
U.S.S.R. But what is the use of
defending the republic from
without if we destroy her from
within—by denying the basic
democratic right of self-
expression from minoritarian
opinions?

After all, the freedom -of
speech, without fear of reprisal
is a fundamental inalienable,
and sacred right of every
American—that right that
makes us a democracy in fact,
not in appearance (remember
the Soviets’ government, on the

_surfact, is very democratic).

Ginsburg’s bogus sense of
aesthetics and his empty in-
tellectual arrogance in pulling
down the signs is tantamount to
unilateral censorship. I am
most distressed to see that the _
totalitarian psyche still lives in
late 20th century America.

tended),
