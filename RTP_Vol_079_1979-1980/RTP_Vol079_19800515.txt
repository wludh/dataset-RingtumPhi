Problems With Graham-Lees

by Edward Gonsalves

Graham-Lees dormitory
rates ‘‘not too high” on a scale
measuring fire prevention and
protection, according to
Charles Wisecarver, Housing
Inspector and Chief of Sanita-
tion for the Rockbridge County
Health Department.

After completing an inspec-
tion of Graham-Lees Dormi-
tory, for the Ring-tum Phi,
Wisecarver stressed the need
for a fire escape and better elec-
trical wiring. .

When asked if the dormitories
should have fire escapes, Wise-
carver declared ‘‘unquestion-
ably, yes”’.

He refused to speculate as to
why the University has failed to
construct fire escapes even
though they are part of the cur-
rent state safety standards.

But Frank Parsons, assistant
to the president, claims that
building codes applied to old
buildings are ‘‘subject to local
administration and interpreta-
tion.”

Parsons went on to say that
the reason fraternities are re-
quired to have fire escapes
while the dormitories are not is
because fraternities are ‘‘more
unsupervised,’ therefore allow-
ing the “building directors to

lean more heavily on them with
respect to current safety stan-
dards.”

Another major flaw of
Graham-Lees Dormitory is the
condition of the electrical
wiring.

Labeling the electrical condi-
tions as poor, Wisecarver notic-
ed many potentially dangerous
electrical outlets and cords.

He said that it would be ‘“‘very
easy for anyone to suffer an
electrical shock” from some of
the outlets.

Wisecarver noted that many
of the refrigerators used by the
students in Graham-Lees are
connected to the outlets with
very questionable extension
cords. A lot of the cord, accord-
ing to Wisecarver, seemed very
small and brittle to be used as
extension cords, especially with
the age of the electrical wiring
of the dormitory.

Wisecarver said that areas in
the dormitory where the plaster
is loose and peeling off are in
violation of the Lexington Hous-
ing Code.

Although Wisecarver said
there were plenty of fire
alarms, he _ still questioned
whether they were operable
because no fire drills take
place. (State regulations re-

 

LEXINGTON — Edward Lee
Pinney, professor of politics at
Washington and Lee University
and one of W&L’s most highly
regarded and_ well-liked
teachers for 17 years, died sud-
denly Wednesday afternoon. He
was 49.

Dr. Pinney and his wife,
Winston, were playing tennis
when he was stricken with an
apparent heart attack. He died
almost immediately.

Funeral arrangements were
incomplete Wednesday night.

Surviving him in addition to
his wife are his mother, Mrs.
Robert Pasho of Pensacola,
Fla.; and two sons, Reese B.
and Edward Lee Jr., both of
Lexington.

He was born Nov. 2, 1930, in
Jacksonville, Fla., and received
his undergraduate education at
Auburn University in Alabama.
He earned his master’s and
Ph.D. degrees in_ political
science at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

He taught at Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, prior
to joining the W&L political
science faculty in 1963. His
fields of teaching specialty in-

cluded European governmental

 

systems, and he was a par-

government of West Germany.

He was the author of the book
‘Federalism, Bureaucracy,
and Party Politics in West Ger-
many and edited another
book, ‘Comparative Politics
and Political Theory,’ which he
developed as a tribute to one of
his graduate professors at
Chapel Hill.

One of Dr. Pinney’s distinc-
tive traits was an unparalleled
wit, which was based on a vast
vocabulary and a_ jet-speed
ability to pick out flaws of logic
or philosophy in any discussion,
no matter how exotic the topic
— and to see and play upon the

quire regular fire drills. )

According to Parsons, an ade-
quate alternative to the state
safety codes exist. He believes
that the present system, where-
by every floor has a planned
escape route and every room
has a fire extinguisher, is
enough protection against any
fire hazard — even without
regular fire drills, until the
renovation of Graham-Lees is
completed sometime in 1982.

Parsons said that renovation
of Graham-Lees has been con-
sidered for many years, but it is
only in the past year that it has
become a high priority.

(The renovation is in the
schematic stage and alternate
methods are being considered.
The Board of Trustees will meet
later on this month to decide the
manner in which the renovation
will occur. )

No matter which way the
dorm is renovated, it will be up-
dated to meet state safety and
health codes.

When asked if the dormitory
would pass the W&L fraternity
fire safety checklist, Wise-
carver hesitatingly said, ‘‘no
comment.”

Trouble On

by David Greer

For the past week, many
students walking from Main
Street down Nelson and across
the bridge have found them-
selves accosted, harrassed, and
in some instances beaten by
local youths hanging out there.

So far, two locals have been
arrested in connection with the
incidents.

Last Wednesday night, two
freshmen, David Smith and
John Solitario, were crossing
the bridge and were accosted.
During the scuffle, Solitario
reportedly sustained a_ knife
wound to the hand.

Marshall David Clark, 20, of
644 Waddell St. was arrested on
a complaint by Smith for
assault and battery in connec-
tion with the incident.

Later that same night, Mike
Cost and Andy Holds, both
students, and Jeff Donahue, a
guest of theirs, were crossing
the bridge when two cars pulled
into a service station at the end
of the bridge. According to
Donahue, someone jumped
them from behind and a group
of five youths began beating
Holds. Others joined the crowd
and there were about 10 people
involved. The gang left, how-

police arrived, and confiscated

Nonetheless, the bat was con-

witnesses, the police officer told

EC Revises Plagiarism
Pamphlet, Kills Salaries

by Randy Smith

At a special meeting yester-
day afternoon, the student body
Executive Committee took the
first step in ratifying a new ver-
sion of Washington and Lee’s
plagiarism pamphlet.

The new pamphlet, which was
composed by Senior represen-
tative Dee Keesler and EC
President-Elect Bob Willis with
the help of faculty and students,
more directly addresses
plagiarism problems at W&L.

The book defines plagiarism
as: ‘‘The unacknowledged use
of someone else’s work in...an
attempt to deceive one’s reader
into thinking that it is one’s
own.”’

examples are

shorter than the old version and
the new pamphlet tries to be
clearer in defining exactly what
constitutes plagiarism at W&L.

The new book also notes that
some journalism assignments
and law school work employ dif-
ferent styles where the source
of information would not be ap-
propriately footnoted or
acknowledged. ‘‘Where no pro-
per means for acknowledging
indebtedness within the assign-
ment are available, the Honor
Code does not require acknowl-
edgement,’’ the pamphlet
states.

The book, which was months
in preparation, identifies three
areas of plagiarism: (1) “‘lying

Poet Woiwode Speaks
Monday In Fairfax

Larry Woiwode, author of two
highly acclaimed novels and
several works of poetry, will
speak at Washington and Lee
University next Monday (May

supporting Glasgow Commit-
tee, and is open to the public at

no charge.

Woiwode’s first novel, ‘“‘What
I’m Going to Do, I think’”’ (1970),
won the Faulkner Foundation
Award for that year. His sec-
ond, “Beyond the Bedroom

Phi Beta Kappa President
To Speak At Library Dedication

Dr. Edgar Finley Shannon Jr.
— currently the national presi-
dent of Phi Beta Kappa, former
president of the University of
Virginia, Rhodes Scholar grad-
uate of Washington and Lee
University, and member of the
W&L board of trustees — will be
the chief speaker at the dedica-
tion of Washington and Lee’s $9-
million undergraduate library
May 24.

The 130,000-square-foot facili-
ty, completed in 1979, will be
dedicated in a two-day series of
celebrations and ceremonies
beginning Friday, May 23. The
events have been scheduled to
coincide with the spring
meeting of W&L’s board, and
among the events to which the
public is invited will be a recep-
tion Friday evening in the new
building.

The dedication activities will
begin Friday (May 23) at 11:30
a.m. when Warren J. Haas,
president of the Council on
Library Resources and former
librarian at Columbia Universi-
ty, will speak in the Mary
Moody Northen Auditorium in
the new W&L building.

The trustees’ reception will
take place at 8:30 p.m. that
evening.

Dr. Shannon will speak at
11:30 the following morning at
the actual dedication ceremony

Skyrocketing Textbook Prices

by David Dallam

The increasing cost of tex-
tbooks is a matter of primary
concern among Washington and
Lee students.

Inflation and other factors
have been taking their toll on
the pocketbook of the average
student (or his parents), for
quite some time.

While the comprehensive tui-
tion fee for undergraduates has
increased from $3,700 in the fall
of 1979 to $4,050 next fall, the
cost of textbooks for a single
course may be as much as $45
and in some cases higher.

The time may come when a
student will consider the cost of
his books before taking a par-
ticular course.

One aspect of the textbook
problem is the conflict between
the store manager and
publisher.

Most publishers suggest the
retail price that the store should
charge for a given book and a
publisher will usually offer a 20
to 22 percent discount on his
books. The store will only break
even with a 28 to 30 percent in-
crease over the publisher’s
price.

Under such a system, the
bookstore becomes only mar-
ginally profitable. Betty
Munger, manager of the W&L
bookstore, says publishers
claim to be losing money by of-
fering their customary dis-
counts, and she cites the in-
creasing use of computers and
the edition of revised texts as
possible factors in their increas-
ed costs of publication.

Yet, she counters their claims
by stating that most of the ma-
jor publishing companies are
owned by congolmerates which

ensure that they are kept in the
black.

But congolmerate control
may be a problem in itself, for
although they give the publisher
complete editorial freedom,
they force him to stop publica-
tions which are unprofitable.
Many of these are college text-
books.

According to Mrs. Munger,
many of the smaller publishing
houses which used to cater
more adequately to the needs of
colleges and universities have
folded through mismanage-
ment.

A new policy which has
recently been innovated is net
pricing. Harper and Row Com-
pany is implementing this
system by billing the store only
for the price of its books.

The store may then deter-

Library Dedication
Schedule; May 23, 24

AN OPEN LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY

As you know, Washington and Lee — the Board of Trustees and
the entire campus community — celebrates the dedication of our
new University Library on Friday and Saturday, May 23 and 24.

A number of public events will take place in the library itself dur-
ing the two days. I think we may be quite confident that the
trustees, distinguished alumni, and other notables and eminences
who will be here will not be so rowdy as to disrupt your studying
completely. But it is possible, on the other hand, that at certain
times during the dedication celebrations, the library will not be
quite as tranquil as may customarily be expected. We certainly
have no intention of discouraging you from using the library. In
fact, the opposite is true: We hope our guests will see the library ex-
actly as it is used every day — in actual routine operation. We do
simply wish to alert you to the likelihood that there will be numbers
of people, from far and wide, who will be walking through this
building from time to time. We hope and expect that the inconve-
nience to you will be minimal, but some inconvenience there may
be.

This is, of course, your library. And therefore the members of the
Board of Trustees and all of us who work and teach on the campus
hope you may find it convenient to join us for the dedication events.
The two-day program will begin with an address Friday morning
by Dr. Warren Haas, president of the Council on Library
Resources. The Board of Trustees will give a reception in the
library Friday evening to which you are warmly invited. The for-
mal dedication ceremony itself will take place Saturday morning,
and Dr. Edgar F. Shannon Jr. — national president of Phi Beta
Kappa, former president of U.Va., a W&L Rhodes Scholar, and
member of our Board of Trustees —will be the principal speaker.
And you are also invited to join us for lunch immediately after the
dedication ceremony. (In order that we may know how many to ex-
pect, we ask you to pick up a luncheon ticket in the main lobby of
the library well in advance.) Details about the dedication events
will be found in the Weekly Calendar and in news articles which will
be issued over the next two weeks by the W&L News Office.

I know you share our feeling of immense pride and satisfaction in
this excellent facility and will welcome our guests as we show our
University Library off and say thanks to those whose generosity,
energy, and talent have made it possible for us to have it.

IFC President

by Richard Moss

Praising this year’s IFC and
Judicial board as. ‘stronger
than any other year,” former
IFC president Syd Farrar said
last week that ‘‘what we did was
with the best interest of the
frats in mind.”

Farrar said, however, that he
feels the actions and_ public
relations of this year's IFC
were hampered by “‘inaccu-
rate” and ‘‘biased’’ reporting
by the Ring-tum Phi.

Saying, “I cannot compli-
ment the members of the
Judicial Board enough,’ Far-
rar added that he felt the
members worked well together
as a group because they were
not dominated by one indi-
vidual. ‘I don't think there was
any favoritism shown toward
Red Square or non-Red Square
fraternities,’ he continued.

Citing the Phi's reporting of
the SAE-Phi Delta-Phi Kap
Fancy Dress affair, Farrar said
that he felt some stories were
inaccurately reported. ‘The
SAE, Phi Delt and Phi Kap
houses were placed on one
week’s social probation simply
because there are no parties
allowed on Sunday, not because
they went over the deadline by
an hour-and-a-half as was
reported in the Phi,"Farrar
stated.

Farrar also said that he felt
the reporting of the decision on
Wednesday night parties was
‘“‘a complete blow-up on partial
facts.”

‘I did not feel as though there
was a personal vendetta being
run against me by the Ring-tum
Phi, I just felt that there was a
lot of inaccurate reporting,”
Farrar added.

“You hear a lot about the
power of the press in politics

classes, and you don’t realize
that that newspaper (the Phi)
carries a lot of weight around
here — it’s the only campus
news source,” Farrar said.
“Certainly it is better than hav-
ing rumors circulating, but it is
of the utmost importance that
the reporting be as accurate as
possible,’ he added.

Pointing out Phi editorials
and Jim Fineman’s articles
about the IFC this year, Farrar
stated, ‘I think Jim had some
good ideas, but it seemed like
everything Jim wrote was
above rebuttal.’’ He added that,
“We were accused of passing
the buck by giving the PiKA-
FiGi case to Student Control,
and yet at the same time,
earlier in the year, we were told
that we were wrong in our
handling of the SAE case by not
turning it over to Student Con-
trol.”

“There were no suggestions,
just criticism,” he said.

Farrar did say however, that
his biggest disappointment over
the year was his handling of the
SAE incident at the beginning of
the year, in which the SAE
house was punished as a whole
for the actions of some of its in-
dividual members at the
Howard Johnson's out on Route

Future Of New Frat Still In Doubt

After voting last week to ac-
cept a new fraternity, the Inter-
fraternity Council left the
group's future at Washington
and Lee in doubt. Another vote
to accept the new fraternity will
be held next week.

“This is my fault entirely,”
said IFC President Monte
Briscoe. “I just took it that we
needed a majority vote.’ The
IFC's constitution requires a
three-fourths vote of accep-
tance to admit a new fraternity
into the group.

The fraternity, ACACIA,
would be a community service
oriented group and is affiliated
with the Masons. The organizer
of the fraternity, Stan Doobin,
told the IFC that he already has
15 potential members and the
backing of the national
organization.

Last week, the IFC voted 9-4-3
to admit the new group. The
three abstentions were all
houses absent from the meet-
ing. But the admittance vote
was not a three-quarters ma-
jority.

“IT should have sent it to Stu-
dent Control so that the in-
dividual members could be
punished instead of the house as
a whole,” he stated.

Farrar said that he was also
very unhappy with this year's
block voting for the IFC elec-
tions. “I don't think that in
block voting you can get. the
best overall results — it’s not a
natural democratic process,”
he said

He added however, that he
thinks the officers elected this
spring will be strong. ‘I don’t
want to take anything away
from them, I just do not feel
that .it is a good process,”’ he
added.

Farrar said that one of his
major problems this year was
with his meetings with the SAC,
“The SAC meetings were clos-
ed, and I didn’t have a group to
confer with,’ Farrar stated. ‘‘I
just had to vote my conscience
— evidently the students
thought it was wrong.”’

“IT could have vindicated
myself, but we agreed that the
decisions would remain con-
fidential,’’ Farrar added.

Discussing the Faculty-IFC-
Administration situation, Far-
rar stated, ‘I think very few
students realize how strongly

Several IFC representatives
argued against admitting the
new fraternity at Tuesday's
meeting. The basic argument
against admittance was that the
IFC at W&L is already too large
and that one more fraternity
would place a financial burden
on the other established groups.

“Who's to say we can deny
them the right to colonize,”
countered Briscoe.

“If they're just a service
fraternity, I don’t see why we
should give them a vote on the
IFC,” said Alan Pryor. ‘‘There
are other service groups on this

the alumni feel about the frats.
They feel good about the at-
titude and physical changes
which have taken place. They
feel strongly about fraternities
at W&L and don’t want them to
see them go down.”

Farrar added, ‘Changes are
so easy to come about. It was a
big change to have Wednesday
night parties. After three or
four years it will probably be
history.”

“IT am firmly convinced that
the administration and faculty
think that what they are doing is
best for the school in the long
run. We are here for only four
years — it is they who are and
should be concerned with the
long run,”’ he continued.

“I’m not saying the student
body and the IFC should fall to
the ground before the admini-
stration. I had a good working
relationship with Dean John,
but I was never told what to
do,” Farrar added.

trend toward improving the
physical appearance of the

placed on the conduct of in-

this to community relations is
greater than most of us
realize,” he stated.

“We should try to keep this

last fully independent fraternity
systems in the country.
Changes are occurring how-

havoc with the fraternities, and
things will have to change —

added.

Farrar concluded by saying,
“College life is to be enjoyed,

what rules are made, the
students are going to find some
way to have fun to get away
from their studies when they

you can not change.”

Movie Review

‘Darlings’ Fail To

by John Wells

Little Darlings, which has
been held over for an additional
week at the State, is a smutty,
innocuous attempt at pubescent
humor which contains a handful
of laughs and line after line of
incredibly bad dialogue.

I will admit that I walked into
the theater with a jaundiced
mind, expecting the worst, and
in that respect was completely
satisfied. Here are two adoles-
cent stars of individual ac-
complishment in a ludicrously
advertised picture with an R
rating slapped on to insure
greater box office earnings.
Little Darlings’ central pro-
blem seems to be a total lack of
credibility.

Tatum O’Neal, who hasn’t
landed a decent role since she
won a premature oscar for
Paper Moon way back when,
shares top billing with Kristy
McNichol whose only previous
movie was The End as Burt
Reynolds’ daughter. O’Neal has
grown quite a bit, but her
talents have not matured with
the years. McNichol displays
great talent and marvelous
potential for a future starring
career. Why she wasted herself
on this trash is hard to fathom
(until you realize how much
money she probably got for it. )

The film opens with introduc-
tions of the two girls, preparing
to go to summer camp, and we
can tell that Tatum is rich and
Kristy is not because one ar-
rives in a Rolls and the other in
a battered ’68 Chevy. After they
reach their destination, Camp
Little Wolf, the plot (no secret if
you've read the poster) unfolds.

The two, who don’t exactly hit
it off at first, share a cabin with
a group of stereotypes of nearly
every kind, save ethnic
varieties: a conceited child
model who looks like Brooke
Shields, wears bedtime attire
from Frederick’s, says stuff
like ‘Nobody makes a fool outta
me, is that clear?”’ and is a real

heard to remark ‘This is bad
Karma,”’; and a fat girl named
Chubby. All the girls (except
Kristy) are  pseudo-
sophisticated, using big words,
quoting Shakespeare, and
simultaneously squealing about
John Travolta and Andy Gibb’s
rear end (apparently there is a
distinction).

I wasn’t expecting a polished
production, so it made perfect
sense for torrential downpours
to fall from sunshiney skies,
and noctural scenes to take
place in obvious daylight. The
musical director has been kind
enough to subject the audience
to an interpolation of several
timeless melodies such as “Let
Your Love Flow” and “Shake It.”

One unbelievable scene
follows the next. The girls hop
on a camp bus and take off for
town, apparently for the sole
purpose of removing a condom
dispenser from the men’s room
of a filling station. The place
has a big OPEN sign on the
door, but no one seems to care
that seven silly-looking teenage
girls have driven up in a yellow
school bus and noisily removed
a profitable machine from the
premises. They don’t even get
caught ripping off the bus.

The obligatory food fight
scene is equally realistic, when
one considers it takes place at
breakfast where tartar sauce,
raw eggs, and flour become
suddenly available for the cast
to hur] at each other.

Kristy McNichol is a fine
young actress and truly
transcends the material (her
first scene requires her to
huskily boot an _ unfortunate
greaser in the groin). Of course
some scenes are so poorly con-
ceived they’d make anyone look
pretty bad. But, despite the fact
that she chain smokes to the
point of encouraging this writer
to consider giving it up,
McNichol is the most ex-

pressive and most effective

Tatum O’Neal floats through
her role and nearly out of the
picture, resorting to eye-
crinkling cutsiness she has
previously avoided unless for
comic effect. This will probably
be a financial boost to her
recently sagging career.

Matt Dillon, this country’s
newest sensation according to
the posters, plays McNichol’s
prospective lover from the
boy’s camp across the lake (and
you can be she keeps the water
hot canoeing back and forth as
frequently as she does). The
boy’s camp activities seem to
be limited to drinking beer,
skinny-dipping, and spinning
around on trail bikes. Anyhow,
Dillon, who obviously has taken
this sensation business serious-
ly, snerls his upper lip and
garbles most of his lines soun-
ding like a cross between
Belushi’s Brando send-ups and
Sly Stallone under anesthesia.
Nothing he does betrays
qualities the audience might
confuse for intelligence, so one
is confounded when he makes
the fantastic admission
‘Sometimes I come out here to
think.’’ Right, stud.

The film rapidly deter-
riorates towards the end as an
attempt is made to be con-
templative and serious. Actual-
ly, the last 15 minutes or so are
a study in mawkishness, with
conflicts resolved and friend-
ships rejuvenated. The bitch
gets told off by Chubby (‘‘You
think you're so good. I’d rather
be fat and feel good inside!”’).

One of O’Neal’s final lines in
the movie is ‘‘We’ve really been
idiots, y know?” I would hearti-
ly agree, and would consider
myself one for paying admis-
sion to see it but for the amount
of copy this column consumes
and the fact that admission on
Monday nights is only $1.50.

The right fare to the right
place with the right guarantees
have made the Air France
“Vacances” flights to Paris the
new choice for student summer
travel to Europe.

Almost half of last year’s
23,000 ‘‘Vacances”’ passengers
were students and teachers.

Senior Art Show

Silkscreens, drawings and
photographs are currently on
display in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery as
part of the annual senior thesis
art show. The exhibition, which
continues through June 5, will
be highlighted by a lecture and
reception in duPont Auditorium
this Sunday (May 18) at 2 p.m.
The public is invited to attend.

Five undergraduate seniors
from W&L who are represented
in the art show will speak on
their subjects in the lecture: J.
Arthur Dunnam III on_ the
history of architectural
elements in the houses of Rock-
bridge County; Douglas C.
Dorsey and Hugh Montgomery,
each with a _ variety of
silkscreens and drawings;
series of photographs by
Richard §. Essex; and an ar-
chitectural study of Rockbridge
Baths by John R. Risch.

Gallery hours are 9 to 4, Mon-
day through Friday. Admission
is free.

The program's popularity may
be attributed to its reasonable
fare, convenient non-stop

Film Society Closes Season With Fellini

by C. Kaston

The W&L Film Society will
close its second year with
Federico Fellini’s Roma (Italy,
1972). Screenings will take
place on Friday and Saturday,
May 16 and 17, at 8 P.M. in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. Everyone is cor-
dially invited to attend this last
film.

Many of Fellini's mature
works have seemed so fantas-
tical, surreal, and even deca-
dent, that it is difficult to
remember that Fellini’s roots
lie in Italian Neorealism. Most
notably, Fellini worked with
Roberto Rossellini at the end of
W.W. II on the neorealist land-
mark Rome, Open City (Roma,
Citta Aperta).

Dash is gone.

He left on a Trailways bus out
of Lexington this morning head-
ed for Roanoke where he caught
a plane back to Chicago. Dash is
from Chicago, if anyone is in-
terested.

The trouble is that Dash
didn’t have a whole lot of
friends. In fact, he had many
more enemies than friends here
at friendly ol’ Washington and
Lee.

He was spat upon twice at the
Fancy Dress Ball by his fellow
students. His date cancelled out
on him when she found out who
he was. He went anyway.

Jefferson Robert Coufal.

He got the nickname ‘“‘Dash”
his second day at W&L. He was
at Natural Bridge for freshman
orientation running around try-
ing to look intellectual and a
dorm counselor called him
Dash. The nickname stuck to
the point that few people knew
his real name almost two years
later.

He probably liked it that way.

But he’s gone now. He got
himself into some trouble. He
didn’t think what he did was
that serious. But his troubles
just escalated and he got
himself suspended and then he
got arrested and had to stay in
the Rockbridge County jail for a
day with the “real criminals”
and now he’s gone.

Dash claimed that he was un-
fairly dealt with, that he was
persecuted for his _ political
views. ‘‘I try to be myself,’’ he
said, ‘‘which just happens to be
different.”’ He is a self-avowed
Marxist.

Dash never really avoided
trouble. He knew the frater-
nities didn’t want him in their
houses and at their parties. But
that didn’t concern him, not
Dash. He went to the fraternity
parties for awhile, even though
he knew they’d throw beer on
him.

“I think most of these guys
here (at W&L) don’t like

Italian Neorealism channell-
ed the energies released after
the war into a cinema of social
conscience and concern for the
ordinary man. It expressed a
faith in the documentary power
of everyday surfaces to reveal
what was meaningful and
“real’’ about experience.

But Fellini felt a lifelong at-
traction to the circus, and
believed that it too revealed
something real about human
experience. Turning increas-
ingly to dreams and the inner
reality of spiritual and psycho-
logical experience. Fellini pro-
duced the films for which he is
most famous: La Strada (1954),
La Dolce Vita (1959), the
ground-breaking New Wave
classic 8 1/2 (1962), Juliet of

themselves,’”’ he said. ‘‘Other-
wise they wouldn’t be threaten-
ed by someone who’s different.
I love myself, which is why I
don’t care what they think of
me.”’

‘What really bothers me are
the people who hate me without
knowing me, or even meeting
me. I don’t like people hating
me second-hand.”

Dash’s problems began when
he started writing on the walls.
He wrote a lot of things that peo-
ple around here don’t unders-
tand. His graffitti was subject
to whim, it was ‘‘a lark,”’ and
usually it was in chalk “so I
never thought it would bother
anyone.”

Then he started writing graf-
fitti in the bathrooms around
campus, but mostly in the new
library’s bathrooms.

“T like writing good graffitti.
At least mine was interesting—
and did not encompass
anonymous personal shots,”’ he
said, almost with pride. ‘‘My in-
tent was not to permanently
destroy or deface anything.”’

But the Student Control Com-
mittee didn’t see it that way.

the Spirits (1965), and Fellini
Satyricon (1969).

In these movies, although
such judgments are obviously a
matter of personal taste, Fellini
is occasionally guilty of cross-
ing the fine line between depict-
ing reality as grotesque and
depicting what is grotesque as
‘“‘the norm.” One occasionally
feels that the human has been
objectified, put on show, until it
becomes something unrecog-
nizable, freakish.

Fellini’s own Roma is the
story of a city a vast historical
and cultural excavation of
Roman life. The grotesque and
freakish here, as in the lovingly
analytical Amarcord (1974),
are humanized by their presen-

tation as we move from the °

Dash Has Left W&L And Gone Back

His punishment was to clean all
graffitti from every bathroom
wall on campus. He was in-
sulted, taunted, and jeered by
his fellow students as he carried
out his punishment.

So he stopped. It was “per-
sonally humiliating,’’ he said.
But Student Control, the student
disciplinary body, thought that
suspension from school would
be the appropriate punishment
for noncompliance.

But Dash thinks the suspen-
sion was an overly harsh penal-
ty. “I didn’t destroy $30,000
worth of boxwoods,’’ he said,
‘“‘of course, I’m not on the
basketball team either.”’

Then there were some pro-
blems at Spanky’s, the local
delicatessen/restaurant. He
broke a bottle on the rail outside
the establishment and put the
jagged end under a car’s tire.
The manager caught him so he
pulled it away.

He was officially suspended
from the university on April 24
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, acting on Student Control’s
recommendation.

He went out that et and _

clesiastical fashion show at the
Vatican to the motorcycle sub-
culture whose members
threateningly circle the city’s
great piazzas at night in a final
stream of light and color. Per-
haps this is because Fellini’s is
an imagination that has been
repressed by Catholic taboos as
much as it has been enriched by
the extravagance of Catholic
ritual.

Fellini’s flair for combining
urban realism with a sense of
magic finds its consummate ex-
pression in a scene in which
modern technology confronts
the Roman past. A team of sub-
way builders, literal ex-
cavators, comes upon a walled-

off cavern of beautiful ancient
frescos which, as they are ex-
posed to the air, first appear
and simultaneously vanish for
all time right before our eyes.

We have very much enjoyed
bringing movies to the W&L
campus again this year, and we
thank all of you for your support
and interest. We are planning a
new schedule for next year and
would welcome suggestions.

drunk ‘‘drunk off my ass,”’ in his
words,

In the early hours of the mor-
ning he and his companion
decided to relieve themselves,
right on the yellow line running
down Nelson Street. The ever-
watchful Lexington Police
Department was on the prowl,
though, and gave pursuit.

His friend got away, but Dash
didn’t take being chased by the
cops seriously, so he stopped
and surrendered. They threw
him in jail on charges of
urinating in public and drunk in
public.

He was in jail until 7 o’clock
Friday evening, when a. friend
of Sally Mann’s paid the $135 to
bail him out. He got himself a
lawyer and had his day in court
Tuesday.

And now he’s gone, on his way
back to Chicago.

Dash was different from
everyone else at W&L, and he
liked it that way. He like to
“blow people out ”’ It’s ‘‘good
sport,’’ he said.

‘A lot of these guys (at W&L)
deserve a good shaking up.
They all

have middle-class

values—all they think about is
security and money. This place
is just a rich boys’ school,’’ he
said.

He found the girls who fre-
quent W&L to be “mindless”
and only interested in ‘‘looking
for husbands.”’

‘Most of the professors are
good, but they’re trapped with
students looking only for a
grade,’’ he said. ‘‘These
students are spouting
hypocrisy. They are born
privileged and they are saying
that in America there is equal
opportunity—which is horses--
."

“W&L confirmed and inten-
sified my Marxist views. If
these guys are capitalism’s
finest, then this country’s in
trouble. Most of the guys here
are scared they’re fags.”

So Dash has gone home to the
punk-rock bars where he feels
comfortable. ‘I’m not different
in the Chicago punk bars,’’ he
said, “there I’m quite at
home.”’

“It was just a waste of time
being a Punk among preppies,”’
he said, and he was gone.

A Look At Washington And

by Alan S. Kendrick ARR

“The faculty Executive Committee will con-
sider a motion passed by the Executive Commit-
tee that will extend the hours that women will be
allowed to visit in the Freshman dorms and frater-
nity houses. This, along with a new rule allowing
women on the upper floors of residence areas,
gives W&L students more freedom and respon-
sibility than ever.’ If this seems to you a
somewhat dated decision for the administration to
be making, you're right. They acted on it ten years
ago. But it serves to point out the sweeping
changes that have come about in campus life in
just the past decade.

The seventies have marked a very active period
of growth and change at this school, in the
physical campus, academic schedules, and policy
governing student affairs.

The $3.5 million renovation of McCormick Hall
and the remodeling of Tucker Hall, two projects
still being completed, are the final steps of a huge
expansion program contained almost completely
in the last decade. In '69-’70, Dean Lewis G. John
and others were discussing expanding the campus
to provide needed space for the influx of women,
expected due to the strong movement to coeduca-
tionalize the institution. The planners felt that if
expansion was not feasible, the coeducation move-
ment would have to be scrapped. Although plans
for bringing women to W&L gradually faded, the
expansion was carried out ina very big way.

At that time, a plan was considered to “‘move
the commerce school to McCormick Hall and relo-
cate the library into a new ravine location or the
west campus.’ It was reported that “the plans are
still in their infancy, but funds are being increased
and studies made to see if the plans can be trans-
formed into a new W&L University.’ Today, the
dreams, the architects’ models and the incessant
sound of construction blasting have resulted in
much larger, more convenient facilities.

The first phase of construction was a giant addi-
tion to Doremus Gymnasium that is now known as
Warner Center. Construction went rather slow at
times, and the tied-up facilities were a real in-
convenience to the students. But finally the work
was completed, in December 1971, and the com-
plex was inaugurated with a rousing defeat of UVa
on the new basketball court.

The same year, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Lewis
donated $9 million to construct a new law school

 

 

that would relieve the crowded conditions in
Tucker Hall, which then served as the law school.
The Lewis Hall complex was built across Woods
Creek and completed in the Fall of 1977. The same
company that built the law school was contracted
to build the $8 million undergraduate library in the
‘Ravine location,’ and the Woods Creek apart-
ments, completed about the same time as the law
school.

Also in the first part of this ten-year period, the
university center was built across Washington
Street from the rest of the campus, and the newer
freshman dormitories were added (as originally
outlined in the coeducation plans).

The undergraduate library was then started, as
the last big building project and was completed in
around four years and slightly ahead of schedule. ~
The construction company is now working to
finish preparing McCormick’s interior, as part of
the last phase of the work.

While the campus was undergoing change, the
ideas of the student body were also redeveloping.
The nation was in the middle of its involvement in
the Vietnam war, and all the students were con-
cerned with the issue of the draft. The possibility
of selection under the Nixon administration’s lot-
tery system was the dominant topic of conversa-
tion everywhere. When the lottery was completed
in mid-December of ‘69, all the students “heaved a
sigh of relief Those who got ‘fat numbers’ (far
away from the cutoff point) started trying to
figure out how to break their ROTC contracts.”

Some who were chosen were visibly upset, while
others merely accepted their fate. These last were
berrated by some of their colleagues for their
‘‘will-less passivity.”’

Wrote one concerned student, ‘‘As long as the
U.S. fights in that small country, we are involved
and responsible for whether or not we are pulling
triggers and bombsight mechanisms or putting in
another nickel and punching pinball flippers.”’

Another student, whose number was chosen,
tried to take matters as lightly as possible, He
wrote his own version of the John Wayne movie
heriocs, ‘Military code for the faint of heart,’’ And
printed it in the Ring-tum Phi.

Others were noticed for their participation in na-
tional conventions of the John Birch Society.

But all of the anti-war sentiment eventually

. came toa head nation-wide in the infamous period

of the *‘seven days in May,”’ when several students
were killed by national guardsmen at Kent State

University. The demonstrations were happening
' on college campuses all over the country.

Washington and Lee also shared in the experience.
Three weeks before the end of the semester, in
early May, many students began to boycott

classes and held a number of rallies, as well as at-
tending rallies at other schools. At this time many
colleges caught up in the protest of the war came
under pressure from students to discontinue
classes and close for the rest of the year. A
number of institutions did; while the administra-
tions of others simply told students to pipe down
and go back to class. The most radical segment of
the W&L student body asked for, and received per-
mission earlier in the semester, to take in-
completes in their courses and leave to participate
in the protest. A movement was then undertaken
to make W&L the southern regional strike head-
quarters for all the colleges in the protest.
Brandeis, in Massachusetts, was the national
headquarters. Meanwhile, W&L itself was still in
session, and exams were fast approaching. A
movement was started to close the school and
adopt a curriculum of protest, with seminars to
discuss the sociological implications of the war. A
resolution was fielded to the student body for a
referendum, to achieve this idea. Students were

asked to vote according to whether they thought
the school should be a part of the national move-
ment. The student body, which has traditionally
been apathetic, turned out in large numbers: of a
total of 1,367 students, 1,319 voted in the referen-
dum, and only 254 voted against the resolution.

The faculty met that night and decided not to
allow the resolution to be carried out. But, at the
same time, they had an interest in allowing the
school to express its opinion. President Huntley
called an open-air meeting in front of the Lee
Chapel to announce the faculty's resolution: To
allow students to take incompletes on part or all of
any courses, with a completion deadline of
September 30, so that those who desired to pursue
the protest could do so. Classes were still held, and
most of the students who took incompletes came
back in a short time to complete their work. Presi-
dent Huntley summed up the feeling of the student
body as *‘A deep committment, lightly held.”’ In
the aftermath of the college strike movement,
W&L gained a reputation of having acted rational-
ly in a time of great stress. This stance was
reflected in a statement printed when the resolu-
tion was being considered:

“Closing Washington and Lee for a month is not
like closing an elementary school three days for
snow. The faculty resolution allows those who feel

 
The Ring-tum Phi, May 15, 1980, Page 7

Lee During The Volatile 70's

more immediate concerns to postpone their school
work. The proposed student body action is a cop-
out. We cannot declare Washington and Lee edu-
cation irrelevant and simultaneously expect the
rest of the world to continue to take it seriously.”’

Aside from the war, the student body was
undergoing turmoil in a number of other ways.
Between ’69 and ’71, three fraternities folded and
another managed to remain solvent only by aban-
doning its stately house and moving to smaller
quarters. Kappa Sigma, ATO, and Pi Epsilon Phi
all closed, and Delta Upsilon followed a few years
later. The student body was becoming apathetic to
one thing that it did take seriously: Fraternity life.
The number of pledges in these years dropped
drastically. Many students felt that they just did
not need fraternities, and the Greek system was
having a hard time convincing many freshmen
otherwise. Obviously, this trend, like all others,
reversed itself.

Sweeping changes were made in student affairs
policy. In addition to more lenient parietal rules
and visiting hours on upper floors, which were
finally opened totally in ’74, after it was observed
that UVa had done so, (the parietals at other peer
colleges were frequently cited in arguments to
free restrictions), dress codes were gradually
loosened. Freshmen were allowed to have cars for
the first time in 1969, and decisions were made
that year for even greater changes in the next
year.

In 1971, the old semester system was changed to
the current trimester system to allow students to
finish their exams before Christmas break, and
allow for greater curriculum flexibility. Most of
the required freshman courses were cut.

In the same year, a deferred rush policy was in-
stituted, and freshmen could not pledge until the
7th week of the fall term. And to the question,
“‘How can a freshman be oriented to the campus if
you take him away from the campus?”’ Freshman
orientation was held on campus for the few years
that deferred rush was in effect.

The University council, which was established
in response to demands that students have a big-
ger part in campus policy, was also instituted mid-
way through the ’70-’71 year, along with the honors
system.

The faculty worked to manage locally the drug
problem that was sweeping the country. Said Dr.
Imeson, on a committee to control the problem
and help students who were addicted or otherwise
in trouble, ‘‘The policy of the school is to counsel
students who have been affected and help them to
recover, and educate those who have not been af-
fected through a distribution of literature on the
subject.”

Partly as a result of the new yearly schedule,
but primarily because of increasing student
disinterest, Fancy Dress was cancelled in ’71. It
had come off with great difficulty the year before,
and the Executive Committee decided early in the
school year to can the project for “‘lack of funds.”’
The fact that the regular time for Fancy Dress, in

 

 

 

 

longer existed made it hard for the students to get
excited about it. The big ball was to remain in lim-
bo for the next three years until it was revived in
"74.

The issue of going coed had some interesting
turns in the early seventies. The law school admit-
ted women for the first time in the 1972-1973, but
there was not as great a pressure for the under-
grad segment to follow suit. In one instance there
had been a movement to have coed short term and
admit at least a hundred women to classes. But
the only successful program has been to have a
few exchange students each year.

One exchange student attempted to help stu-
dents experience the coeducational experience in
her own way. A Miss Red, a freshman at
Randolph-Macon, had been admitted to W&L for
her sophomore year. She decided she wanted to be
as active as possible, so in the spring before her
year at this school, she ran for sophomore class
president. After getting a petition signed, she
threw the Executive Committee into an uproar as
to whether a non-regular student should be allow-
ed to run for office, or be included on the ballot.
After much heated debate, they finally agreed
that she must be included, and Miss Red ran for
the votes just like the rest of the guys. She was not
elected.

One other notable student movement came in
1975 when the E.C. recommended and sought to
pass a resolution to abolish the academic proba-
tion standards, on the grounds that the pressure
was not fair to students.

People making the headlines in the first part of
the decade: Prof. Milton Colvin, who ran for the
democratic nomination for senator in Virginia.
After considering running early in the period, he
dropped out because he did not think 'e had
enough funds to run a successful camp?” 1. When
Senator Harry Byrd decided torun* 1 Indepen-
dant, Colvin renewed his camr’ ,.. and made a
strong effort to gain the nor ..ation. He was not
successful in his bid however, and was defeated by
a candidate from Northern Virginia.

“I’ve known some pretty smart peanut farmers and by God this isn’t one of them,”
Senator Barry Goldwater said at Friday evening’s Second Session. The Arizona
Republican was the keynote speaker at the Convention, appearing with Congressman
Henson Moore.

There were few surprises in Goldwater’s speech. The Senator asked his student au-
dience to work hard and make the United States so strong ‘that another country will
never dare to take American hostage again.”’

In another blast at the Democratic Party, Goldwater said: ‘‘Think of all the junk, all
the lies that we’ ve had to listen to from these liberals and radicals.”’ The Senator ended
his comments with a plea to W&L’s student body: ‘‘If you want to live a good life, one
upon which you can look back upon with pride, do your duty.”’

Reagan Wins On First Ballot; Second Time In M.C. History

Front runner Ronald Reagan
received an overwhelming ma-
jority of delegate votes at
Washington and Lee’s Mock
Republican Convention _ last
weekend and walked away as
this year's Republican
presidential contender,

The former California gover-
nor received 1,587 votes. Am-
bassador George Bush finished
a distant second with 386 and
John Connally received two
delegate votes. There were five
others.

The state of New York put
Reagan over the 998 mark need-
ed to capture the nomination.
They gave all 123 votes to him.

Minutes be‘ore all votes were
thrown to Reagan, a powerful
New York party official was
called, (he was pulled off the
golf course), who authorized all
43 of New York’s uncommitted
delegates to put Reagan over
the top.

Within five minutes, an of-
ficial from Bush’s mid-Atlantic
headquarters in Baltimore
knew and called Lexington to
find out what happened.

He said he was impressed
with the authenticity of the Con-
vention, but naturally unhappy.

Earlier in the state roll call
vote, Reagan scored heavily,
capturing most of the delegates
from California, Illinois, In-
diana and Florida. Bush did
well in Michigan, Massachu-
setts and Connecticut.

After adjourning one hour for
lunch, conventioneers and spec-
tators returned to hear Reagan
address the convention by
phone.

Reagan began by_ praising
Barry Goldwater and jokingly
asked if he had to continue cam-
paigning.

He then launched into a pro-
Republican speech for the quiet
crowd.

‘The situation in the world to-
day is very precarious,”’ said
Reagan. ‘‘I believe all of this
was due to misguided govern-
ment policies.”’

‘We have it in our power to
begin the world all over again,”
he said. ‘We have a rendezvous
with destiny. Mankind is
waiting for this (American)
dream to come true.”

Reagan was the second man
in Mock Convention history to
be nominated on the first ballot.
The last one was William Jenn-

ings Bryan in 1908.

Tennessee's favorite son,
Howard Baker, was chosen as
Ronald Reagan's vice-
presidential candidate by the
WA&l 1980 Mock Convention. The
senator received 1,005 delegate
votes.

But the discussion became

Also at last week’s meeting

week’s paper because of a lack
of space), the IFC altered the
selection process for Contact

As a guide to keep students
from falling into the plagiarism
trap, the pamphlet advises that
“facts or opinions acquired
before the assignment was
made require no_ specific
acknowledgement, but informa-
tion gained after the assign-
ment was made must be
acknowledged.”

The new book was given to
students in some English 101
classes for their comments and
suggestions.

At Monday night’s EC
meeting, the committee voted
to strip all editors and business
managers of campus publica-
tions of their salaries. Any
surplus profit the publication
might make would revert to the

Myers brought the proposal to
the IFC, which allows for the
President, Vice-President, and
Secretary of the IFC, the EC’s
Big Three officials, as well as
the President of the Student Bar
Association to interview and
select Contact applicants.

(In the past, the IFC and EC
president and’ vice-president
have selected the Contact
chairmen, but the chairmen
selected their own committee
members. )

Contact chairmen this year,

that he feels the former

Jay Blumberg, senior EC
representative, led the fight
against the salaries, saying that
he thought salaries for editors
and business managers were
unfair to leaders of other cam-
pus organizations.

(The Publications Board con-
stitution now provides for the
editor and business manager of
the Ring-tum Phi and the Calyx
to receive 22.5 percent of the
surplus made by the publication
at the end of the year. Last
year’s editor and _ business
manager of the Ring-tum Phi
each received $130. )

The EC’s motion to abolish
salaries, which passed 7-4,
would not affect this year’s
editors and business managers,
but is supposed to take effect
next year.

“Salaries are inconsistent
with everything else on this
campus,”’ said senior law
school representative John
Fraser.

chairmen of Contact should

process of next year’s commit-
tee. )

The change in procedure was
instituted because of com-
plaints in the manner Contact
has been selecting committee
members.

(At least one student has com-
plained to this year’s EC that he
applied to be a committee
member, but was never con-
tacted. )

Also last week, the IFC voted
to spend $90 to send three Lex-
ington youths to camp this sum-
mer.

Willis, Keesler, EC President
Steve Abraham, and EC Vice-
President Les Cotter voted
against the motion to take away
salaries.

A representative from the
Publications Board was not pre-

- sent at the meeting.

The Executive Committee
also made some_ cosmetic
changes to the Voting Regula-
tions Board’s elections rules in

_ response to the problems en-

countered this year when fresh-
man John Lowe received cam-
paign contributions.

The rule that write-in can-

didates are subject to the EC’s-

spending and poster limits was
reinstated. Also, write-in votes
will no longer be allowed in run-
off elections.

In addition, the committee
added a clause stating that: ‘
“Any action or event influenc-
ing voters in an unfair manner,
as well as any question of possi-
ble violation of the stated rules,
shall be brought to the attention

hearing of the matter, will
decide whether or not the can-
didate is permanently dis-
qualified from the pending elec-
tion. The decision of the VRB
may be appealed to the Ex-
ecutive Committee.”

EC President Abraham also
announced that W&L will dou-
ble its night security force to
two persons on duty in response
to the increase of crimes
against students.

He also thanked the Mock
Convention committee for the
job it did on last weekend’s
Mock Republican Convention
and called it “the most organiz-
ed and well-run event on this
campus in four years.”

support of the highest ideals of
this institution were unstinting.
He will be sorely missed.’

Munger Discusses Textbook Problems

(continued from page 2)

mine its own price for resale to
the student, possibly adding to
it the cost of shipping. Net pric-
ing appears to be the marketing
trend of the future, according to
Mrs. Munger.

The second major aspect to
the textbook problem is the
faculty. Although Mrs. Munger
says that relations between the
faculty and the store have
always been good, she notes
that some faculty members

have created difficulties for her
in determining what kind and
quantity of books they will need
for next year.

Professors are required to
complete forms listing these re-
quirements but are often late in
returning them to the manager.
As a result, Mrs. Munger says
she often has had to resort to us-
ing silly gimmicks, such as the
pinning of carnations on jacket
lapels, in order to encourage
them to return their forms.

In determining the texts to be

used, the various departments
remain conscious of costs to the
student, even though they may
miscalculate by ignoring the
further costs entailed by net
pricing. Mrs. Munger says the
faculty is constantly kept in-
formed of impending price in-
creases.

But even with price rises
given all due consideration,
history speaks for itself. The
Mathematics Department has
changed its textbook for use in
Calculus 101 each year for the
past three years.

The student must bear the im-
pact of both of these aspects of
the problem. Mrs. Munger says
that although the bookstore has
a monopoly on business, its pur-
pose is first and foremost to
serve the students.

She is fully conscious of the
fact that many students must
mitigate heavy expenditures by
buying used books for a dis-
count of one quarter of their
original cost, although she will
not accept for “‘buyback”’ books

which are heavily highlighted,
believing that students should
think for themselves and not let
others do their thinking for
them.

Two major problems exist
with the “buyback”’ policy: the
first is that the store knows only
one week before buying back
which texts the faculty will be
utilizing during the coming fall
semester and which texts will
be obsolete.

The second major problem is
that students engage in text-
book commerce among them-
selves, distorting projections of
the number of textbooks needed
and eliminating the potential
“‘buyback”’ market.

Mrs. Munger said that
although price increases hurt
the students, the student body
is, in general, affluent enough to
absorb the costs. But for how
long? Because of inflation and
the increased cost of living,
solutions must be found.

One solution may be for stu-
dents to continue buying and

selling among themselves. The
bookstore currently buys text-
books from students for half the
original price and resells them
for 75 percent of the original
price. If a student were to sell
his textbooks to another student
for, say, two-thirds the original
price without using the book-
store as middleman, then both
students would profit from the
venture.

Another solution may be to
encourage the marketing of
textbooks at other bookstores in
Lexington, thus effectively
breaking the monopoly of the
campus store.

Until a practical solution is
found, however, students will
have to live with the harsh
realities of the present situa-
tion. Take the rather insidious
example of the textbook cur-
rently used in History 107, The
National Experience, which has
increased in price three times
this year alone from $9.95 to
$10.95 to the current price of
$11.95.
 

Tennis To Compete In
Div. [1] Championship

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team, which last week cap-
tured the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference title for the fourth
consecutive year, will compete
in the NCAA Division III Cham-
pionships at Claremont-Mudd
College in Claremont, Califor-
nia. The four-day event began
Wednesday, May 14.

Six Generals will join head
coach Gary Franke at the
Championships: Seniors
Stewart Jackson (Lake Forest,
Ill.), David Constine (Rich-
mond, Va.), and Pat Norris
(Dallas, Tx.); juniors Pete
Lovell (New Bedford, N.H.) and
Doug Gaker (Middletown,
Ohio), and freshman Jackson
Sharman (Tuscaloosa, Ala.).

Co-captain Jackson has had
impressive showings the last
three years in the NCAA tourna-
ment. As a freshman, Jackson
teamed with former W&L great
Ben Johns (class of 1978) to win
the Division III National
Doubles Championship. Later
that same year, Jackson and
Johns participated in the 1977
NCAA Division I National
Championships at the Universi-
ty of Georgia.

The following year, 1978,
Jackson and Johns almost did it
again, finishing second in the
NCAA doubles competition and
again traveled to the Division I
tourney.

In 1979, Jackson, now a
junior, made it to the singles
quarter finals of the Division III

tourney, gaining All-American
honors for his third year in a
row.

Says head tennis coach Gary
Franke, ‘“‘We’re heading west
playing our best tennis of the
season. The tough competition
we played early in the season
(W&L met 10 Division I op-
ponents this spring) may not
have helped us post a great dual
match record, but it enabled us
to win the ODAC title and we
hope it will help us in the NCAA
Championships.” ,

The Generals completed their
regular schedule with a 7-12
dual match record, nine losses
coming at the hands of NCAA
Division I members. The team
claimed the ODAC title on Tues-
day, April 29, when four singles
and two doubles entries won in-
dividual honors. W&L posted 78
points to outdistance runner-up
Hampden-Sydney, which had 67
1/2 points.

At the NCAA event, W&L will
have entries an all four singles
flights and both doubles divi-
sions. Jackson, Lovell, Con-
stine, and Sharman will man
singles positions; Jackson and
Lovell will comprise one
doubles unit, Gaker and Norris
the second.

Last season W&L finished ina
fourth-place tie with Swarth-
more College at the NCAA
Championships; in 1978 the
Generals took runner-up honors
to Kalamazoo; and in 1977 the
team tied with Claremont-Mudd
College for second place as
Swarthmore claimed the title.

Lacrosse Drops To Fifth;
Lose To UNC, 7-5

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals Lacrosse team drop-
ped to fifth in the recent USILA
polls as a result of a 7-5 defeat at
the hands of the University of
North Carolina last Saturday at
Wilson Field.

The game, which was the last
home game for the Generals
and ended the season for the
Tarheels, was attended by over
6,000 Mock Convention and
Alumni weekend fans and was
marked by slow deliberate

play.

‘People think it was a slowed.

paced game, but is was just a
different kind of game,”’ com-
mented Generals head coach
Jack Emmer. ‘You can credit
the low score to the play of the
goalies.”’

W&L got off to a good start,
taking a 2-0 lead on goals by
Roman Kupecky (the only score

quarter) and Mike Pressler on
an extra-man situation. But the
Tarheels came back to tie the
score at 3 apeice by the end of
the half.

The Third quarter saw the
Generals go ahead twice, but
UNC came back early in the
fourth period to tie the score at
5-5,

The result of the fourth
quarter belonged to the
Tarheels as they scored at the
5:06 mark to put them ahead
and then again with only 1:17
remaining in the game to give
them a two goal lead. The
Generals were able to find the
shots but UNC’s goalie denied
them any further goals and the
game ended with North
Carolina claiming a 7-5 victory.

The loss put the Generals’
season record at 10-2 and moved
them down to fifth place in the
National rankings behind No. 1

 

UVA, Johns Hopkins, Syracuse
and Navy. W&L has one re-
maining regular season game
at Hofstra this Saturday. North
Carolina’s record is now 7-3 and
they are ninth in the standings.

As a result of the defeat, the
Generals lose the home field ad-
vantage in the first round of the
playoffs, but coach Emmer
feels that-a win over Hofstra,
should move W&L back up into
fourth position and regain the
home-field for the first round.

“If we beat Hofstra, which is
no easy feat, we believe we
should be seated No. 4,” he
commented.

The top four ranked teams
are given the home field advan-
tage in the playoffs, which start
on May 21 and the finals will be
played at Cornell University on
May 31.

Soccer Team Beats Alumni

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity soccer team maintained its
hold on the cherished ‘‘Golden
Boot” last Sunday with a 2-1
double-overtime win against
the W&L Alumni team in the
third annual meeting of the
squads. The varsity how holds a
2-0-1 series lead.

The alumni took a 1-0 first-
half lead before the varsity
knotted the score during the
second half to send the contest
into overtime. After a scoreless
first overtime period, Brad
Poorman netted the winning
goal in the second extra period.

W&L head soccer coach Rolf
Piranian reported that 19 alum-
ni participated, the most since
the series began two years ago.
Greet Barriault, W&L class of
1978 from Houston, Texas,
received the award as the alum-
nus having travelled the far-
thest to the game and as the
outstanding alumni player.

Joining him on the alumni
Squad were: 1970 graduates
Buddy Bahakel, Doug Pinotti,
Doug Dorsey, John Stagamier,
Dana Samuelson, and Doug

Seitz; 1970 graduate Ken
Newman; 1973 grad Mike
Schaeffer; 1974 alumni John

Lane and Buck Leslie; and 1978
class members Ace Dods, Todd

Tyson, Bill Stone, Murray
Holland, Mark Derbyshire,
Roger Yale, and Sandy Bishop.
Dods and Tyson served as co-
captains.

Funds Needed For Nature Hike

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent is heading an effort to raise
$40,000 for a matching grant to
be used for repairs and addi-
tions to the Maury River Nature
trail.

The contribution deadline is
June, 30. All those interested
should contact Marshall Clark.

In December, 1979, the
Virginia Environmental En-
dowment pledged the grant to
the VMI Foundation, Inc. after
the institute obtained the
former Buena Vista-Lexington
right-of-way of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railroad Co.

Work has already been done
on the nature trail. Bush and
weed removal is nearly com-
plete except for a small section
just east of the South River
bridge, The roadbed has been
repaired and is in acceptable
condition. _

Future plans call for the con-

stuction of a foot bridge over the
Maury River. The probable
location will be the pilings from
the old wooden trestle that was
destroyed by Hurricane
Camille.

Two other foot bridges, one
over Mill Creek and the other
over South River are also plann-
ed.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Mock Convention

By almost anyone’s measurement, last weekend’s
Mock Convention was a huge success. There can be
no doubt that it was one of the best organized and
most efficiently run events held at this school for
quite some time.

It was a massive undertaking involving a very
large group of students. Yet, the organizers—despite
the difficulties of their jobs and differences in
personalities—worked very well together. In one
observer's words, they became almost a fraternal
organization, in the better sense of the phrase. There
was no infighting or backstabbing, but there was a lot
of teamwork—as there had to be in order for such a
large affair to be successful.

Of course everyone knows who the Mock Conven-
tion chairmen were: Craig Cornett, Sidney Simmons,
and Richard Schoenfeld. But there were some other,
unsung behind-the-scenes people who were also
responsible for the smoothness of the event. Goetz
Eaton was in charge of transforming the gymnasium
into a convention hall and for troubleshooting those
inevitable little problems that always seem to crop
up. If you saw the Mock Convention Journal then you
already know what a good job Sam Flax did (even if
he is a law student). Guy Steuart kept the media fat
and happy and made our job much easier..

There have been some complaints that the conven-
tion was an exercise in futility because ererybody
knew that Reagan was going to win. But it is not the
fault of the conventioneers that the present national
delegate selection process has almost locked up the
nomination for the former California governor by
mid-May.

What is significant is that within five minutes of the
New York delegation’s vote—reportedly based on a
high-ranking party official’s instructions—one of
Bush’s men was on the phone to find out what went
wrong. Now that is clout. It is a definite sign that the
W&L Mock Convention is highly respected for its ac-
curacy to predict the actual outcome of a convention
Which is still two months away.

Something else to note are the remarks of the
speakers. Both Senators Warner and Goldwater had a
marked tone of pessimism in their speeches. Their
general message was that America is in trouble—
serious trouble.

It is long past time that we wake up in this country
to the realization that we are not the great, domineer-
ing nation we once were. The United States is being
humiliated in Iran, outmaneuvered in the Middle
Kast, and bounced around by our so-called allies.
Even if our military manpower is adequate, the
equipment with which we ask our soldiers to fight is
not.

The politics of applying a recession to correct an
overheated economy is a painful remedy of doubtful
wisdom. Graduating seniors already know what the
climbing unemployment rate has done to the job
market. These are grim times and it looks as if things
will get worse.

Senators Warner and Goldwater were both calling
to our generation to clear up the mess that the past
generation has made of the world. We hope that the
next groups of college graduates will heed the call—
before it is too late.

Advice For The Future

Dear Editor:

I am writing to you students
for the purpose of saving you
money.

Nowadays there is a great
speculative boom in housing.
Millions of homebuyers are
stretching their budgets to buy
the biggest houses they can. In
fact, they use so much leverage
that their outstanding mortgage
balances remain approximate-
ly unchanged for many years.

Little do they know, there are
two directions that the price of

anything can go: there is up,
and there is down. Do you think
housing prices will ever go
down?

History shows that every
great speculative boom has
ended with a crash. Soon there
will be an historic crash in the
housing market. Millions of
home prices will fall far below
their mortgage balances, plung-
ing their once-proud owners
deep into debt.

Millions of greedy
homeowners are planning to

cash in on your ignorance,
(even after they could have
taught you better in school). So
warn all your friends: Don’t
buy a house until after the
prices crash, and even after a
crash, there are always two
directions that the price of
anything can go: there is up,
and there is down.

Contrary to popular belief,
prosperity is caused by in-

vestments for income, and
never by investments for
capital gain.

Persiflage On Irresponsibility

Irresponsibility doesn't come
easily. It takes many years of
dedicated practice and deter-
mination.

‘ro a lot of people, irrespon-
sibility means something along
the lines of watching T.V. all
night before the hardest exam.
But that's baby — stuff
—something a 14-year-old kid
can do.

True irresponsibility must be
spontaneous and unquestioned.
You must accept the challenge
presented by circumstances
and totally blow off whatever
‘serious’ matters you might
have had planned.

Now some might argue that
irresponsibility is a great evil
and should be corrected, but
that’s a bogus viewpoint
developed and perpetuated by
healous little worms who never
had the guts to test themselves.
One of the greatest virtues of
being irresponsible is that you
can get to discover your
capabilities.

Can you go on a week-long
roadtrip and still pull off an ac-
ceptable grade? Can you give in
to your friends’ taunts, take a
few b-hits and still perform in
your seminar class? In short,
can you have your cake and eat
it too? I have been testing these
hypotheses for years and can
now report that not only is it
possible to successfully blow it
off, it’s fun and easy too.

Of course, if you do achieve
this goal, you will inevitably
receive the condemnation of
certain people in our small com-
munity. They simply cannot
tolerate the fact that someone
might be having fun and yet be
successful at the same time.
They wish to see everyone
brought down to their own
stodgy, close-minded existence.
But let’s face it, it’s just not fun
to sweat in that hot, stuffy
library ona nice spring night.

Kinniburgh Column Blasted

Dear Sirs:

As regular readers of your
music column, we have always
hesitated to write in disagree-
ment with any of the reviews
found therein. Everyone is en-
titled to his or her own opinion
about an artist, record, or
musical style, and Mark Kinni-
burgh’s views are certainly as
valid as those of anyone else.

Opinions are one_ thing,
though, and facts are quite
another. Over the past several
months your reviewer has been
casually throwing out errors,
misstatements, and_ ill-
informed comparisons that
should make even a casual
music fan cringe:

1) Referring to the author and
performer of the new single
“Cars’”’ as Gary Norman is
simply inexcusable. Gary
Numan has been featured on
Saturday Night Live, and in all
the major music publications
(and his name does, after all,
appear on his album covers! ).
The error occurred a half dozen
times over the course of two

separate columns, so this was _

no typo. How can a reader place
any credibility in a review of
Numan’s music, when the

reviewer can’t get his name
right? ;
2) Perhaps hoping that his
readers wouldn’t know the dif-
ference, Mr. Kinniburgh recent-
ly wrote that the new Elvis
Costello album had ‘‘hit number
one on the album charts’’. In
fact, the record hasn’t even
come close to doing so. Bill-
board (the most respected
music industry publication)
currently places the album in
the teens.

3) What exactly is ‘‘semi-Styx
new wave’’ (last week’s col-

umn)? Styx has never had
anything at all to do with the so-
called new wave, either music-
ally, socially, or politically.

I realize that all of this may
seem trivial in the overall
scheme of things, but these are
just a few examples of your
reviewer’s irresponsibility to
his audience. Mr. Kinniburgh is
welcome to his opinions, but
he’d be well advised to get his
facts straight first.

c
Parker Potter

Last weekend was my second Mock Convention. My first, the 1976
affair, left a bad taste in my mouth, but I’ve always chalked that up
to a freshman’s naive and incomplete understanding of the college
world around him.

This time I know better.

My principal concern, four years ago and today, is Friday night’s
platform session. There is no reason in the world why that session
needed to be the 90 proof farce that it was.

One would think that in a year when even the stray dogs on the
collonade knew that Saturday would be a one ballot cakewalk for
Reagan some great effort would be made to make Friday night’s
activities a little less festive and a little more meaningful.

A well-planned platform session could have been an excellent
forum for intelligent discussion of several key issues of the day. As
it was, Friday night was an overloud cocktail party with an occa-
sional voice vote thrown in.

For that, I hold the organizers of the convention directly
responsible.

First, I feel that the central committee or whatever allowed too
few people to become centrally involved in the planning etc. of the
convention. There were just far too few people on the convention
floor with much of a stake in what was going on. For them, drinking
was as good a thing to doas any.

As well, I don’t think the platform session was adequately plann-
ed or encouraged. One gets the feeling that the big wigs felt that the
platform session was just an inconvenience, something that needed
to be done, and treated it just that way. And that attitude certainly
filtered down to the convention floor.

Part of the problem with Friday night was the fact that it was
next to impossible to hear anything. Why is that? Well, some have
suggested that the widespread drinking and subsequent socializing
on the floor is responsible.

And whose fault is that? Why, the very people who could not be
heard above the din (co-chairmen, people like that...) are the peo-
ple who sent out a flier stating that drinking on the floor was
against the rules and suggesting discreet ways to smuggle in li-
quor. Talk about stacking the deck against yourself.

The combination of limited involvement and endorsed drinking
was a one-two punch that KOed Friday’s second session.

And since I’ve seen two separate platform debates go down the
same tube, perhaps it’s time to ask a few questions. What is this
convention and what is it trying to do?

It seems that it is very proud of its accuracy and is very proud of
its high level of student involvement.

The accuracy part could be handled quite neatly (and quite ex-

 

\ pensively) by a dozen people in a small room. But part of the uni-

; >)
Thoughts On The Mock Convention

queness of the convention is its high rate of student involvement. It
is imperative that our convention be the “boomingest,”’ at least to
Time magazine. ;

But what is the nature of this student involvement? For 95 per-
cent of the Mock Conventioneers it is staying up all night building a
float, watching a parade, drinking and socializing Friday night and
voting Saturday in a roll call or two in a manner already specified
to state chairmen by somebody regionally coordinating them.

I think that the planners of the 1984 Convention must ask
themselves one question: At what price spectacle? The very Marc
Hannas | alluded to above who-could have been the Mock Conven-
tion were the Mock Convention.

The vast majority of the delegates were simply neck-tied window
dressings in a giant puppet show. At one point Craig Cornett had the
assembled masses ready to jump through a hoop called rule 16-B.
In fact, he called for a vote before he had explained just what 16-B
was.

One chairman from a large northern industrial State, less than
one week before the convention, indictated that he would give all
his delegates to one candidate because he’d seen in a News Brief
that that state’s governor had endorsed the candidate. Not to worry
— there’s a regional coordinator.

As it is, the Mock Convention is a shameful fraud. I felt so sorry
for the fellow nominated for vice-president by Texas, the man from
the foundation who had donated so much to the convention. The
poor sap bought himself a party.

The Mock Convention cannot continue to butter its bread on both
sides. It can’t keep endorsing drinking on the floor while pretending
to do things from one podium.

Most of all, it can’t keep up the pretense of student involvement
when so few have so much stake in things.

The two options are clear.

The convention can maintain its presently spectacular size and
make a monumental effort to involve people in the proceedings by

enforced sobriety and by putting greater time and effort into the
platform session.

Or, the convention can keep real involvement in the smoke-filled
room and reduce the size of the thing.

In any event, a convention whose leaders rigidly enforce a
necktie dress code while teaching ways around its own drinking
regulations can’t fool too many people too much longer. A well-
dressed drunk is still a drunk.

And a convention hall full of people who know what’s going on,
who care what’s going on and who are part of what’s going on sure
beats last weekend’s drunken charade.

they are not pleased with the
way the police have handled the
incidents. According to Hughes,
“The police are totally un-
cooperative.”

A spokesman at the Lexing-
ton Police Station said that
while no extra men have been
put on duty, patrolling has been
intensified in the area at night.
More arrests are reportedly
forthcoming.

. Assistant Dean of Students
Danny P. Murphy has been
alerted to the situation. He has
spoken with Dr. Thomas Ime-
son, who is a member of the
Lexington City Council.

Imeson said he in turn spoke
with .Lexington Police Chief-
James A. Kirby and Lexington
City Manager John V. Doane
about the situation.

“The only approach the
University can take is to con-
tinue to talk with those people,”
Murphy said. He pointed out
that it would be improper to try
to have University. Proctor
Charles *“‘Murph” Murray
patrol the area.

“IT hope the students don't
take it upon themselves to
retaliate; that would only
escalate the problem,” Murphy
added.
