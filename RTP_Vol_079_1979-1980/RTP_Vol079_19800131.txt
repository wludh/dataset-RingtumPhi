Yesterday’s University Council Meeting

by David Greer

The University Council
yesterday rejected two por-
posals that would had banned
live bands at both the Cockpit
and fraternity houses during
the week.

The proposals came from the
Student Affairs Committee
after ‘‘consideration of the
January 2 Report to the Univer-
sity Faculty on Implementation

 

of the University Council Action
of May 3, 1979.”

The proposals postulated that
‘‘no paid, live music be permit-
ted on any such weeknight”’ at
fraternity houses and ‘“‘that the
prohibition against weeknight
social functions, including live

music, be extended to the
Cockpit and all University pro-
perty.”’

The first proposal was

defeated 13-8 and the second
17-2, with two abstentions. Pro-
fessors John Holt Merchant and
Edward L. Pinney voted for the

proposal and Dr. John M.
Evans and IFC President Syd
Farrar abstained.

Most of the discussion was on
the second issue. The SAC had
intended for the two to be con-
sidered together, but the UC

EC Lowers Fancy Dress Price

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
learned Monday night that
tickets to Fancy Dress will cost
five dollars less than the
original price given by the Stu-
dent Activities Board.

_ Tickets to the dance will cost
$15.

Bill Ridge and David Har-
pole, Co-Chairmen of the SAB,
were told last week to appear
before the EC and explain the
SAB’s Fancy Dress budget.

After making and examining
its Fancy Dress budget, the
SAB voted to drop the ticket
price $5 from the original
price—$20.

Ridge told the EC two weeks
ago he was not sure how much
the Ball was going to cost since
alumni were barred.

‘‘We were concerned that we
lost 650 tickets from the alum-
ni,’ said Harpole Monday
night.

‘The 1980's will see organized
rebellion and Africans in
America will be on the front
lines to destroy the capitalist
system,’’ said civil-rights
leader Stokley Carmichael in
his speech at Washington and
Lee University’s Lee Chapel
last night.

The prominent crusader for
equal rights was sponsored by
the University’s Student
Association for Black Unity.

Carmichael is a member of
the All-African Peoples’
Revolutionary Party, an
organization whose objective is
Pan-Africanism, ‘‘the total
liberation and unification of
Africa under scientific
socialism.”’

Carmichael blamed the capi-
talist system for the oppression
of blacks in this country, citing
the system as the reason for
originally bringing slaves out of
Africa.

Once the capitalist system
has been destroyed, Car-
michael said the goal is a
“society where those who labor

 

 

Several EC members still had
questions about the SAB’s
seeming carelessness with the
Fancy Dress budget.

“I’m concerned how you
came up with the figure twenty-
dollars,’ said EC President
Steve Abraham.

Ridge and Harpole said the
mistake was their fault and told
the EC that they held a meeting
at which SAB members voted to
sell the tickets for $15.

EC Secretary Cove Geary
noted that the SAB would pro-
bably not spend $7,000 of stu-
dent funds allotted by the EC
for Fancy Dress.

The SAB Co-Chairmen ex-
plained that Fancy Dress
should cost about $25,000. They
said 1600 tickets would probably
be sold, raising $24,000 or $1,000
less than the Ball will cost.

“I think this is ridiculous, are
you planning on making money
on Fancy Dress?” Jim Wenke,

get the fruits of their labor in-
stead of all the goods going toa
select few.”

In order to reach this goal, he
places the responsibility on the
African students in the colleges
and universities, using the term
African to refer to all blacks.

Sophomore Representative,
asked Ridge and Harpole.

The two SAB members ex-
plained that they need the $7,000
in the SAB budget for cash flow
reasons.

They explained that SAB
Chairmen had always done it
this way in the past.

‘In a sense you deceived the
EC about the $7,000 in the fall,”’
said Geary.

The Co-Chairmen said they.

did not intend to deceive the EC,
but were working on precedent.

Wenke also asked the pair
why they cancelled a meeting
Sunday evening.

“We called off the meeting
because we had done
everything we needed to do,”’
said Ridge. Harpole added that
they are waiting for materials
to come in.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg also criticized the Co-
Chairmen for an incident this
weekend in which a SAB
member lost $140 collected
from the SAB movie.

You two .are the two Co-
Chairmen, it is your respon-
sibility to watch the money,”’
said Blumberg.

Ridge explained that a SAB
member, Dan Weiss, left the
money in the computer room,
where someone found and
returned it.

Dance Marathon

Raises $23,594

Students at Washington and
Lee University raised $23,594
this past weekend toward
muscular dystrophy research
and treatment by ‘‘rocking
around the clock”’ in the second
annual W&L MD _ dance
marathon.

Some 150 determined dancers
tripped the light fantastic for 30
hours beginning Friday night in
Washington and Lee’s Evans
Hall.

When they stopped, in the wee
hours of Sunday, they had sur-
passed their $15,000 goal by 60
percent.

To raise the money, each
dancer or couple had to obtain
pledges totaling at least $45
each from individuals and
businesses. Sponsors agreed to
pay either a certain amount for
every hour a dancer could stay
on the floor or a regular fee for
completing all 30 hours of the
marathon.

Jay J. Blumberg of Boonton,
N.J., two-year chairman of the
marathon and a senior at
Washington and Lee, led this
year’s steering committee with
the help of co-chairman James

B. Hemby, a junior from
Wilson, N.C.
Anheuser-Busch Co. was in

the forefront of business
supporters—donating $800 for
entertainment expenses. Many
of Washington and Lee’s 16
social fraternities supplied
copious amounts of beer as well
as cash donations. Even a
number of the bands that had
been scheduled to play by
regular contract gave back
large portions of their fees as
gifts.

In all, seven bands performed
for the students and guests,
keeping spirits high. A galaxy
of special events also served to
help the dancers through the
wee hours of the morning—

Gen. Westmoreland Discusses

Global Problems Facing U.S.

by Ed Edge

The United States in the 80s is
going to have to strengthen its
position on world issues and
regain some of the international
respect it had in earlier years,
former Army Chief of Staff
William C. Westmoreland said
in his speech Tuesday night in

Washington and Lee Universi- -

ty’s Lee Chapel.
“In the 70s, our nation
became tranquilized and

militarily weak,’’ the general
said.

Westmoreland pointed out
some shaking events that oc-
curred in the past decade that

include a break between China
and the Soviet Union, the over-
throw of the Shah in Iran, the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the establishment of cordial
relations between Israel and
Egypt.

He said that the Chinese-
Soviet break has only served to
make each more suspicious of
the other; the reason the Egyp-
tians and Israelis made peace
was to protect their borders
from outside forces. The over-
throw of the shah was encourag-
ed by our building him up
militarily, said Westmoreland.

‘The United States has got to

make itself more assertive on
international issues,”’ he said.

The Soviet Union is making
major moves in the world
toward expanding its power;
‘the Russians are imperialistic
and make no bones about it,’’ he
said.

Westmoreland said that the
Russians are skillful and alert
to any chance for gain and do
not care about world opinion-
that every move they make,
they provide an excuse for do-
ing it.

‘I feel that the likely targets
of the Soviets, after
Afghanistan, would be

3 W&L Students

Involved In
Texas Inn Scuffle

by Mike Perry

Students visiting the Texas
Inn in Lynchburg may have
more to fear than the possibility
of an upset stomach. Last Fri-
day evening three Washington
and Lee students were involved
in a Skirmish with two uniden-
tified locals and an employee of
the Texas Inn.

The incident began when Jim
Abeloff, a W&L junior, ac-
cidently nudged the elbow of an
unidentified restaurant patron
seated at the counter of the
Texas Inn. The man questioned
Abeloff’s action angrily, accus-
ing Abeloff of attempting to
start a fight. Abeloff apologized
and attempted to explain away
the matter.

Jeff Hamill, one of the W&L
students involved, explained
that the man then ‘‘stood up and
pushed Jim onto the floor,” at
which time Hamill and Will
Hodges, another W&L student,
tackled the man and wrestled
him to the floor.

Immediately after the scuffle
started the cook came out from
behind the counter and _ hit
Hamill in the face while another
unidentified man emptied a
Coke bottle and broke it over
Abeloff’s head.

The two men ran out of the
restaurant and drove off in a
pickup truck. Hamill claims the
Texas Inn cook knows the iden-
tity of the man who hit Abeloff
with the bottle and called him
by his first name.

David Proctor, another W&L
student who witnessed the inci-

-dent, said the cook ‘‘seemed to

know him” (the man who hit
Abeloff with the bottle). When
Proctor asked the cook, ‘‘Is this
the way you keep order in
here?’’ the cook showed Proctor
an automatic pistol he had tuck-
ed in his belt.

When the police arrived at the
scene, Hamill said, ‘‘they
weren't very much help.” Proc-
tor agreed and added that ‘‘the
police had to hear the story 15
times before they would even go
in and talk to the guy with the
gun.”’

When Proctor persisted in
questioning the police about the
cook’s gun, he was told to ‘shut
up or he’d throw me in jail.”’

Later, Cove Geary, another
W&L_ student, witnessed
another incident at the Texas
Inn which did not involve
Washington and Lee students.

Geary Says a group of ‘‘locals
started throwing plates and
glasses behind the counter,”
and in a matter of minutes three
police cars and a paddy wagon
arrived.

Mock Convention Report

 

Rep. John Anderson:
‘A Formidable Task Ahead’

by Mark Birenbaum

As the focus of the Republican presidential
primary process switches from Iowa to New
Hampshire, several things are clear. Among those
has to be the candidacy of John Anderson of Il-
linois.

Mind you, Anderson, the third-ranking
Republican in the House of Representatives, is by
no means a “‘front runner’’ in the horse-race con-
text in which we view the candidates today. And
he even admits that. But, how far behind can any
‘‘horse’’ be so near to the starting gate?

Anderson did not campaign in Iowa, but he did
receive 4.1 percent of the vote of Republican par-
ticipants, according to the New York Times.

Votes aside, perhaps the best thing Iowa, par-
ticularly the Des Moines debates, did for Anderson
was to establish a potential chain reaction. He’s
been noticed: he was the only Republican to state
a position in favor of the President’s grain em-
bargo. People are beginning to realize that Ander-
son is not as' ‘‘liberal’’ as they first thought. And
along with that, people are seeing that he is a
qualified candidate, if such a beast exists.

On social issues, Anderson does seem ‘‘liberal,”’
if professor Hughes will excuse the term. He was:
one of the first Republican representatives to urge
ratification of ERA; he opposes the development
of the B-1 bomber and the neutron bomb; he sup-
ported the Panama Canal treaties, he has co-.
sponsored a program to finance House general
election campaigns, and, along with Rep. Morris
Udall, he has co-sponsored the Alaska Lands Bill,
which will conserve blocs of that state while allow-
ing for responsible development of Alaskan
natural resources.

Anderson stands alone among Republican
Presidential candidates in that he has endorsed
ratification of the Salt II treaty.

Concerning energy, he has proposed a 50 cents
per gallon tax to reduce consumption and was one
of seven House Republicans to vote for President
Carter’s standby gasoline rationing plan.

Anderson’s campaign manager, William G.
Bradford, admits that he has a formidable task
ahead in making people aware of Anderson’s
fiscal conservatism, a record that shows support
for former president Nixon’s ‘‘New Federalism”’
plan.

A bill to limit government spending, authored by
Anderson, would constrain government spending
so that it corresponds only to the rate of national
economic growth, review tax levels annually to
assure that they do not impede economic growth
and require that the President present a balanced
budget to Congress by fiscal 1982.

“I do not believe in the quick fix, the $50 rebate,
the huge surge of spending as a way of suddenly
reversing the economy,’’ Anderson has said.

Bradford characterizes his candidate as a
‘‘Republican who dares to wear his wallet on the
right and his heart on the left.’ Perhaps that
description helps explain Anderson’s 1978 ratings
of 55 percent from Americans For Democratic Ac-
tion and 44 percent from Americans For Constitu-
tional Action.

Whatever, Anderson’s heart has not always
been in the political ventricle where it is today. He
came to Congress in 1961 as a “‘typical Midwestern
conservative,” reports the Congressional Quarter-
ly. He was elected on a platform opposed to ‘‘big
government”’ and communism.

During the 1960’s, ACA hailed Anderson’s record
as one of the most conservative in Congress. “He
stands firm against the liberal processes in Wash.-
ington, the wild spending schemes and the per-
missive society offered by proponents of the Great
Society,”’ was the rhetoric of a 1968 ACA release
endorsing Anderson for re-election.

Over the years, he’s also been loyal to his party.
He backed Nixon’s plan for a re-negotiated settle-
ment in Vietnam, although he publicly stated the
was was ‘“‘the most tragic error in diplomatic and
military policy in our nation’s history.” In 1964, he
supported Sen. Barry Goldwater for president,
and today he can still take ‘‘digs” at Carter and

“the greedy, parochial, self-interested,
democratic Congress.’’ Gerald Ford, Henry Kiss-

inger, Bill Brock and Jack F. Kemp all campaign-
ed for Anderson in his 1978 House campaign.

Anderson’s political chameleon act came in
1968, according to CQ. As a member of the House
Rules Committee, he cast the deciding vote that
sent an open-housing bill to the floor. There, he
was instrumental in swinging several Republican
votes for what eventually became Civil Rights
Law.

In his 1970 autobiography, Between Two
Worlds: A Congressman’s Choice, the first-
generation American of Swedish heritage, wrote
about that vote: ‘‘There came to bear in my think-
ing the realization that even to the point of subor-
dinating something as fundamental as the right of
contract to the even more fundamental principle
of human rights.”’

Religion plays a large role in Anderson’s life. In
1964, he was named the outstanding layman of the
year by the National Association of Evangelicals.
But his heroes, he has said, are Republican
figures. He admires Abe Lincoln for his compas-
sion, Teddy Roosevelt for his dynamism and
Dwight D. Eisenhouer for his tenets of fiscal
responsibility and decentralized government.

Watergate has had a refective effect on him. If
elected, goes the campaign promise, he would use
the presidency to re-establish what he describes
as the nation’s ‘‘vital center,’’ appealing to com-
peting interest groups to work together toward a
common national prupose.

If his deep religious beliefs and his campign
stomping sound similar to a dark-horse candidate
of 1976, another similarity could be the running of
“John who?” ads in New Hampshire. But any
comparison stops there. Anderson has had exten-
sive experience in national government.

He has been a member of the House for 20 years,
Chairman of the House Republican Conference for
11 years and a senior member of the House Rules
Committee. He also has some Foreign Service ex-
perience. As a member of the Ad Hoc House
Energy Committee, he has argued for creation of
an oil-purchasing cartel to deal with OPEC.

On the hill he has established a “reputation as
one of Congress’s best orators and finest minds,”’
according to CQ. The Washington Post has written
that he is ‘‘one of the most highly respected public
servants of any party.’ Even one of his opponents,
Sen. Robert Dole, has called him ‘probably the
brightest of the Republican candidates.” The Des
Moines Register described him as ‘‘a silver-haired
orator with a golden tongue, a 17-jewel mind and a
brass backbone. He is a man of charm, grace and
intellect...’’

Anderson is no stranger to sponsoring bills
either. Last year he was chief sponsor of the
Regulatory Reform Act, legislation which would
benefit both business and consumers by pro-
moting competition and reducing governmental
bureaucracy.

His strategy for the Oval Office in three-phased.

His first concern is to achieve name recognition.
A Gallup poll in September showed that only 20
percent of their respondents recognized his name.
Of course, finances limit his efforts. In September,
Anderson has only one-tenth as much money as
John Connally.

The second phase is to finish in the top two or
three in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, the
top two in Illinois and win in Wisconsin.

The final phase will be to develop a Midwestern
strategy; Anderson has noted that region will send
more delegate votes to the National Convention
than any other region.

‘‘Maybe he thinks in his own mind that he can be
elected President,”” Paul Weyrich, Director of the
Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress,
has said. ‘‘But if he does, he’s not as smart as I
think he is.”

Stranger things have happened in American
politics, according to Bradford. In November, he
commented: “‘If there were only two candidates in
next year’s Republican race, we wouldn’t do well.
But there are more than two. We will have our
whole slice of the pie. Others will have to cut
theirs.

State Chairmen Begin
Search For Delegates

by Sidney Simmons

Although the Mock Conven-
tion is over three months away
state chairmen have already
begun recruiting delegates for
their respective states.

At the real Republican Na-
tional Convention in July there
will be 1994 delegates. Because
of size limitations at Washing-
ton and Lee, delegations will be
‘scaled down to three-fourths of
their real size. This means that
the number of delegates to the
Mock Convention will be around
1495. Each state chairman is
responsible for filling his
delegation with students bet-
ween now and the weeks just
prior to the Convention.

For obvious reasons not every
student will get the opportunity
to be on the delegation of his
choice or on his home state's.
Many of the states from which
there are a large number of
students have rather small
delegations while some very
large delegations have only a
handful of natives.

Each delegate will be issued a
floor pass with his name on it
similar to the real convention,
only those people confirmed or
approved in advance by the
Credentials Committee can par-
ticipate in the convention pro-
cess.

At the Convention only dele-
gates, press, and officials will
be allowed on the floor, Spec-
tators will be confined to seats
at one end of the hall.

Because of students coming
from surrounding schools there
will probably be more people
who would like to participate
then there will be room to ac-
comodate them.

It is important for W&L
students to sign up as delegates
to insure they will be included in
a delegation. Nobody should
assume that because they know
a state chairman they will be
able to get on his delegation.
State Chiarmen are limited by
the size of their delegation and
unfortunately will not be allow-
ed alternate delegates.

To insure your position on a
delegation you should talk to a
state chairman. Lists of the
chairmen and their phone num-
bers are posted around campus.
In the next couple of weeks give
one a call. If his delegation is
closed you will have plenty of
time to look elsewhere. There is
no reason to be left out this May
9 and 10.

Preacher Jack Wows
Them In Cockpit

by Rob Walton

Preacher Jack started play-
ing dive bars in and around the
Boston area after his expulsion
from school in the ninth grade.
He remained in these dive bars
for 20 some-odd years until
George Thorogood
“discovered” him in Boston and
arranged for his singing with
Rounder Records. Rounder is
now promoting Preacher on a
general southern tour for addi-
tional exposure before he starts
his European tour in March.

Preacher’s first album on
Rounder will. also be released
sometime in March. Following
his return from Europe in May,
Preacher will be appearing on
Saturday Night Live.

Preacher Jack is_ finally
receiving the exposure and the
acclaim he has worked so hard
for SO many years.

Preacher's love for ‘Boogie
Woggie’’ rock and roll started in
the ’50’s while he listened to the
likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, now a
personal friend, Little Richard
and Elvis. Preacher claims to
have taken all these great rock
personalities and melted them
down to form his own personali-
ty.

Preacher says that he
depends on the electricity that
develops between himself and
his audience. He sees himself as
the Billy Graham of rock and
roll, bringing Jesus Christ to the
audience through the medium
of rock and roll.

While many members of his
audience may not relate to the
religious aspect of his  per-

‘Menagerie’ Opens Season

“The Glass Menagerie,’ Ten-
nessee Williams’ haunting
memory play, will be
Washington and Lee University
Theatre's first production of the
winter season. The play opens
Monday and continues through
Saturday. The curtain is at 8
each evening for the show,
which will be presented in
W&L’s Boiler Room Theatre, in
the basement level of the Old
Main Street shopping mall in
the center of Lexington.

Leonel L. Kahn, associate
professor of drama _ at
Washington and Lee and head
of the University Theatre for 15
years, will direct the drama.
Scenic design is by Thomas J.
Ziegler.

“The Glass Menagerie’’.open-
ed on Broadway in March 1945,
and was the first major success
for the young Williams and a
brilliant comeback vehicle for
actress Laurette Taylor in the
lead role of Amanda Wingfield.
The play signaled the rise of a
new postwar school of
American drama, in which

Williams was soon joined by a
number of talented new writers
including Arthur Miller and
William Inge. For Williams
himself, the semi-
autobiographical play marked
the start of three decades of
success in the theatre.

In the spotlight for W&L’s
version of the four-character
play are Joellen Bland as
Amanda, the faded Southern
belle still living in a world of
‘gentleman callers’’ and coy
girlishness; Katherine Reiche
as her daughter Laura, a crip-
ple as fragile as the glass or-
naments she collects; John
Fort, a freshman at W&L, as
Amanda’s son Tom, a factory
worker yearning for a better
life; and Grant Kunkowski,
W&L sophomore who played
Hamlet in the successful pro-
duction of that tragedy earlier
this season, as the ‘‘gentleman
caller’’ who is eventually coax-
ed into visiting the Wingfield
home.

Kahn

acknowledges the

Dash’s Movie Review

relative ease of directing such a
small company of actors, and
called the rehearsals for the
show ‘‘great fun.’’ He says that
‘‘like all of Williams’ plays of
the era—‘A Streetcar Named
Desire,’ ‘Summer and Smoke,’
and ‘The Rose Tattoo’—the
beauty of the play is in the
language. The writing is so im-
peccable, and characters so
alive.

“Still, there is a great danger
within that very virtue,’ Kahn
Says. “It is so good a script that
it’s easy to let the play simply
‘run itself’ and miss altogether
the intellectual power hovering
just beneath the surface.”’

The box-office for the produc-
tion is open all this week and
throughout the run of the play.
Tickets are free for all
members of the Washington
and Lee community, and seats
are available for guests at a
small charge. Reservations are
necessary in any case, and
should be made by calling the
theatre at 463-9111, ext. 371.

In Search of Historic Jesus
Directed by Henning Schllerup
Written by Marvin Walk and Jack Jacobs
With John Rubenstein and Bob Crandan

From Summ International, the people who
brought you In Search of Ancient Astronauts, and
In Search of Noah’s Ark, bring you another of their
exciting educational films! The tragedy of it all is
that this thing is sure to make money.

Basically the whole movie revolves around the
shroud of Turin, the linen cloth that Christ is said
to have been buried in that has the image of a man
of it.

What little structure there is to the movie is as
follows: first they try to prove the authenticity of
the Bible by proving the authenticity of the Old
Testament using leftover footage from Noah's
Ark, then they tell the story of Christ and go into
endless speculations as to the missing years of his

life, then some ‘‘experts’’ tell us why the Shroud of
Turin dumbfounds them (one of them actually
says, ’’Here we must leave science behind...!!!’’).

The narrater, Bob Crandan, both looks and talks
like Roger Whitaker. His voice is annoying, he is
constantly summing up what has gone before, he
is constantly making meaningless and moronic
gestures with his hands, and the phony interview
scenes are the worst.

The movie’s methods are, needless to say, less
than scientific. All the ‘‘experts’’ keep saying that
something could have happened one way and ig-
nore all other hypotheses.

And let’s fact it, it’s not history, and it’s not
spectacle. The special effects are poor, the sets
are cheap, and all the actors look like scrubbed-up
hippies. It’s hard to believe that the Roman em-
pire could have been so low-budget.

All I can say is that as far-as finding the historic
Jesus, Cecil B. DeMille came closer.

Intense Marathon Music

by Mark Kinniburgh

It’s always difficult to write after a big weekend,
but this last weekend and the second annual
Washington and Lée Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon was the ultimate killer. | really don’t
think I’ve ever seen a party so big or intense in my
four years here. The music was excellent and
varied all weekend from rock to disco to blue-
grass, each of which kept the dances interested
and moving. My thanks and congratulations go out
to all of the groups, but one in particular caught
my attention as probably the best band to visit
W&L was ‘‘Tracks.’’ Not only did they provide
Super dance tunes, they performed at a profes-
sional level which is rare for a band on the college
circuit. Be prepared to catch them the next time
they come to W&L or UVa, and listen to WLUR for
their tapes. Not to drag on, but these guys are
headed for much bigger things than anyone else
that has ever been here—stay tuned.

Onto a more national setting and new artists
who seem to be coming on very strong, let’s begin
with “The Romantics."’ The draw of this band lies
in the driving 60's rhythm in their songs, usually
accompanied by bright percussion, solid bass
lines, and acoustic guitar. Although their first

album entitled “The Romantics” has not been
released all over the country yet, a special four-
song record has become a very hot item in radio

and retail circles.

“The Pretenders’ are another‘band that has
become a reasonable success with their first
album of eight songs. Led by a female vocalist/
guitarist, The Pretenders play a heavy brand of

distorted music featuring urgent, piercing lyrics.

Although it would seem that the power-pop market

is packed full with less than acceptable sometimes
trashy talent, more bands like the Pretenders are
surfacing literally weekly. Besides the two I have
mentioned, there are Pear! Harbor and the Explo-
sions, The Starjets, The Specials, The Dukes, The
Babys, The Jam Off Broadway, The Rockets and
many more with releases in the last two weeks.
My real gripe abcut all this attention that is being
given to this type of band is that the record com-
panies begin to resemble the big car manufac-
turers in that they are all offering the same pro-
duct under different names. There are few labels
with the coverage to try something new for fear of
short-term economic penalty, but if they would on-
ly realize that the future is in something complete-
ly new, they could insure their companies success
for many years.

Notes: Coming from the Knack this week—their
second album...also this week, new stuff from
Nazareth, David Gates, Warren “Exitable Boy”’
Zevon, Chuck Mangione, Iggy Pop, The Ramones
and others believe me!...Remember the Cowsills?
They just signed with Columbia Records...Cheap
Trick is recording number five in the British West
Indies. ..The Who switched record companies from
MCA to Warner Brothers for an exchange sum of
12 million dollars...The Tom Robinson Band is
reforming in England now to head a “Rock

against Racism” tour...The New J. Giels Band

albumn “Love Stinks’ and the new quote of the
year ‘‘What you need Jim are the latest SEX
FACTS”’...Band name of the week “The Hotmud
Family.” Listen to WLUR-FM.

‘Nyet’ To Moscow

by Bill Whalen

And so it looks like the United States will not par-
ticipate in the 1980 Summer Olympics. What at the
moment seems to be a serious matter will be one day
be placed in the annals of history. For the moment,
let’s forget about the games and concentrate on
something more important—like saving civilization.

My writing on this subject is a sad indication of the
current state of international sports. Gone are the
days when the countries of the world could convene in
an internationally neutral site and play games for a
couple of weeks. Instead, welcome to the world of
“realpolitik” and its partner: ‘‘realsport.”’

Yes, “‘realsport’’: that wonderful game where per-
formances are secondary to political issues. But don’t
blame just the Communists for this problem; it’s a
crime that’s been committed by more than one party.

Remember the 68 Games in Mexico City? Before
the Games even started, there were bloody riots in the
streets. Of course, none of the problems were noticed
until the two American medalists gave the Panther
salute during the playing of our national anthemn.

The Munich Games continued the Olympic slide.
The terrorists’ attack will always come to mind first,
but how many of you still remember the controversy
involving Rhodesia and the possible withdrawl of 20
other African nations? Lord knows what would have
happened had not Rhodesia been expelled.

The ’76 Games did not pass without controversy
either. For one, Canada refused to recognize Taiwan
as the “‘real’’ China. Uganda was not present because
of the antics of ‘“‘Big Daddy”’ Amin, preventing the ap-
pearance of John Akii-Bua, winner of the 400-meter
hurdles race at Munich.

And now we have come to Moscow.

It’s the year 1980 and the Russians are on the move,
the United States is beefing up its forces and Ar-
magedon does not seem too far around the corner.

And all we can argue about is sports.

O.K,, let’s talk about it. For example, who’s to
blame? How about Jimmy Carter? Sure, why not, it
was his idea anyway.

What about the United States Olympic Committee?
After all, they went along with the President’s idea.

What about the Russians themselves? They started
the entire controversy by invading Afghanistan.

I personally like to question the International Olym-
pic Committee. First of all, they had the stupidity to
put the Games in Moscow. If the Games represent the
“spirit of universal friendship,’, they why place it in
an oppressive, tyrannical state?

Who are these senile gentlemen trying to fool? The
world as we know cannot simply stop everything and
jock around for two weeks.

To avoid anymore of these boycotts why not place
both the Winter and Summer Olympics in a neutral
place on a permanent basis, such as Geneva,
Switzerland?

' Of course, my solution will do no good. They Olym-
pics will almost always be marred by politics and con-
flicting ideologies. Perhaps the Olympics should be
stopped completely. Do we have such a “jock men-
tality” that we are only concerned with athletics at a
time when your future and mine are in doubt?

And when there is world-wide peace and the prac-
tice of ‘‘realpolitik’’ has been stopped, then we can ap-
preciate the Olympics.

But at the moment, both “‘peace”’ and the idea of the
Olympics are both myths from a world we no longer
live in.

Cagers Win Second Straight
By Routing Wasps, 66-50

by Dale Park

There was a lesson to be
learned in Warner Center last
Tuesday night. The subject was
defense, and the instructor was
the W&L basketball squad.

The Generals did such a good
job of instructing that they held
Emory & Henry to 50 points (the
lowest allowed this season by
W&L), held the Wasp’s league
leading scorer Chuck Ogle to
nine points (his average is 22.0
points) and subdued Emory &
Henry, 66-50.

‘Tonight we played some ex-
cellent team defense, the best in
a couple of years,”’ said Coach
Verne Canfield.

The win was the second in a
row for the Generals, coming on
the heels of an 87-74 win over
Bridgewater last Saturday
night. Junior: center Rob
Smitherman. scored 17 points,
yet the big story was freshman
forward Brian Hansen’s 20
points and 11 rebounds.

Prior to the Bridgewater
game, W&L had lost to Gettys-
burg College, 66-59. Despite im-
pressive showings’ by
sophomore guards George
Spears and Clark New (who net-
ted 17 and 10 points, respective-
ly), a defensive lapse late in the
second half cost the Generals
the game.

Against Emory & Henry there
were no lapses.

‘We never let them get their
spots to shoot from,”’ said Can-
field. ‘‘We kept fresh men on
Ogle and R.J. (Scaggs, junior
forward) did an especially good
job on defense.”’

The pace of the entire game
was slow, as W&L’s defense
forced Emory & Henry away
from the basket. Spans of up to

two minutes separated some.

baskets, but W&L grabbed con-
trol of the game early and never
trailed.

 

tenacious man-to-man
os spurred on the offen-
sive effort. Said Canfield, ‘‘We
used our defense to help us
score.”

The leading scorer for the
Generals was senior forward
Tom Jeffries. Jeffries scored 19
points and grabbed several re-
bounds, coming alive for W&L
after several sub-par games.
Spears was the other big man
for the Generals with 12 points.

For the night, the Generals
shot 56% from the field and 83%
from the line.

W&L has now won two games
in a row, both being ODAC con-

tests. Another important test

will occur tonight when the
Generals face Roanoke.

The last time the Generals
faced Roanoke was _ last
December 3, with W&L winding
up on the short end of a 77-67
score.

Canfield comments’ on
Roanoke: ‘‘We must maintain
the same defensive intensity
and we must be especially
careful to box out on the
boards.”

Says Canfield, ‘‘We want to
show that we are still a part of
the ODAC race.. We want to
show that the rest of the league

Indoor Track Opens At VMI

The Washington and Lee in-
door track team open a four-
meet 1980 season on Saturday,
Feb. 2, when the Generals
travel across town to par-
ticipate in the VMI Relays.

W&L will join 30-35 colleges
and universities in the event,
which begins at 12:00 p.m. in
the VMI Field Houso.

Coach Norris Aldridge, in his
ninth year as track coach, and
second-year assistant Frank
Miriello will try to direct the
squad toward an improvement
over last year’s third-place
showing in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Champion-
ships.

Toward this goal, Aldridge
and Mireillo count on the per-
formance and leadership of tri-
captains Steward Atkinson,
Richard Bird and Paul Hendry.

Atkinson leads the W&L
sprint department, running the
60-yard dash and the 440 mile-
relay events. Bird, a four-year
letterman in cross country,
runs the mile and half-mile
races. Hendry specializes in the
high jump.

Although the graduation of
1979 standouts and_ school

 

record holders Jack Norberg,
Phil Dunlay, and Norville Scott
left holes in the W&L line-up,
the Generals have men ready to

step in.

Joining Atkinson in the
sprints will be juniors Chris
Leiser and Jeff Brown. Impor-

_ tant weight men should be

senior Mike Mrlik, juniors Chip
Nunley, Larry Davis, Tony
Walker, and sophomore Buz
Manning.

Seniors Bob Campbell and
Hamilton Davis will man the
pole-vault event. Junior Chris
Daniel will join Bird in the
middle-distance running.

This season’s ODAC meet, the
final event on the W&L
schedule, is set for Feb. 23 at
Lynchburg College.

Gross Earns Top Award | 7, door Soccer

In Wrestling Tourney

by Chris Sisto
Led by captain Ray Gross,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team finished third in its
own tournament here last
Saturday.

The Generals completed the
day with 43.5 points while
Catawba of N.C. finished first
with 70.25 points. Lynchburg
College came in second with a
score of 68.25 points.

In the eight-team tourna-
ment, four Generals finished in
the top four spots, Three
players, Ed Rodgers, Joe
Wallace and Gross, made it to
the finals. Rodgers and Gross
came away with the top honors.

Gross finished the day with a
perfect 3-0 record, after a 14-4
win in the 142-pound final. He
was also named the tourna-
ment’s Most Valuable Wrestler.

Rodgers also capped off his
perfect day with a 10-7 win in
the 167-pound final.

In the unlimited weight class,
Joe Wallace finished second.

Another General, Mike
Deighan, finished in fourth
place in the 134 weight class.
The only other General that had
a win was Les Heart, who
finished 1-2 at 177.

Head Coach Gary Franke felt
his team finished about where
he had expected, saying, ‘‘Our

players did the best _per-
formance they possibly could
have done.”

Earlier in the week, the
Generals lost to their ODAC
rival, Lynchburg College, 33-19.
This is the first time the
Generals have lost to Lynch-
burg in the six years they have
wrestled them.

According to Franke, the
reason for the loss was. that
Lynchburg has a better balanc-
ed lineup and the Generals have
suffered so many __ injuries.
Perhpas not coincidentally, the
only Generals to have wins

against Lynchburg were the
Same ones who won in the tour-
nament.

Deighan and Gross won on
points while both Rodgers and
Wallace had pins. The team’s
current lineup has_ several
players that simply need more
experience.

Franke says, ‘“‘We have
several young players from
whom we can’t expect too many
big things right away.

The Generals next competi-
tion will be the Pembroke In-
vitational Tournament on
Saturday.

Westmoreland On Soviet Strategy

Yugoslavia after the death of
Tito, Pakistan and Iran,’’ he
speculated.

A 1921 treaty the Russians
have with Iran could be a good
excuse for a Soviet invasion of
the pretense on restoring order,
the general said.

“If the Russians continue to
move through that section of the
world, our oil supply could be
affected and that would be a
severe blow to us,’’ he said.

Westmoreland said that 40
percent of the world’s oil supply
flows through the strait of Hor-
muz and the Russians are only
“one country away’’ and have
military bases only 400 miles
from the strait.

“‘We should not be naive; we
should be aware of the moves
the Russians are making and

he said.

The former General said that
the attack on Pearl Harbor was
an event that helped pull our
country together and _ that
perhaps we should look upon the
events in Afghanistan and Iran
as a “new Pearl Harbor inci-
dent” and try to pull ourselves

disciplined,” he said and added
that, ‘‘there must be a change in
attitude in this country that
starts immediately ; we must be
persistent in the pursuit of in-
ternational respectability.”

‘As we look to the future, we
must recycle old ideals such as
those held by George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.
If we set our moral standards as
highly as those men, we can
regain the international respec-
tability that we once enjoyed,”
he said.

Finds Success

Soccer at Washington and Lee
is more than just a fair-weather

sport.

When the fall season ends and
the winter winds begin to blow,

head Coach Rolf Piranian and ~

the Generals simply pack up the
balls, trade cleats for tennis
shoes, shrink the goals and
move inside. The result: a
three-month indoor soccer
season which keeps everybody
kicking until pleasant weather
returns in the spring.

“It’s part of our concept of a
year-round soccer program,”
explains Piranian, now in his
fifth year at W&L. ‘‘We main-
tain winter and_ spring
schedules so our players cah
keep in touch with the game
while they’re at W&L.”’

The highlights for the 1980
“winter season”’ are a pair of
indoo!’ tournaments. The first,
which takes place on Saturday,
is the third annual W&L College
Indoor Soccer Classic. The sec-
ond, which is scheduled for
February 23, is the W&L High
School Classic.

This season’s college tourna-
ment will feature eight teams:
George Mason University,
Davidson College, Western
Maryland College, West
Virginia Wesleyan, two squads
from W&L, and the Roxborough
(Philadelphia, Pa. YMCA.

The teams, which will be
divided into four-team divi-
sions, will compete in a round-

AIRC EE
RAR Re ARPOEN rp

  

robin format for the champion-
ship.

“These tournaments are the
life of the indoor season,” Pira-
nian relates. “‘It’s nearly im-
possible to schedule regular
matches but we’ve found that
there’s plenty of interest for
tournaments on both the college
and high school levels.”’

Indoor soccer, of course, is
not simply the outdoor variety
moved under a roof. The goal
mouth is smaller (seven feet
high by ten feet wide)) the
“field” is smaller, (60 feet by
110 feet); each team has six
players (including the
goalkeeper) and’ substitutions
are made on the ‘“‘fly’’ (similar
to ice hockey). One game runs
30 minutes.

“The result is a quick, ex-
citing game,’’ says Piranian.
“Since the action is virtually
non-stop, it’s just as demanding
and just as intense as outdoor
soccer.”

Dance-a-thon Great Success;
Strong Student Involvement

(continued from page one)
including a bubble-gum blowing
contest, a ‘hairy legs’ contest,
a mini-concert by ‘Southern
Comfort,’ W&L’'s informal
singing group, and disco lessons
by a local dance instructress.

And there were the ever-
popular ‘‘pie throws,”’ in which
several W&L professors and
other notables volunteered to
act as targets for cream pies,
the honor to go to the highest
bidder. A new record was set
this year when Dan N. Murphy,
assistant dean of students and
coordinator of fraternity af-
fairs, fetched a price of $90.
Close behind were Dean of

‘Students Lewis G. John at $82,
journalism professor Hampden
H. Smith at $50, and politics pro-
fessor Edward L. Pinney at $45.

Another highlight of the
marathon was the appearance
of eight-year-old Rhonda Dee
Adkins of Lynchburg, this
year’s MD Poster Child from
southwest Virginia, who stayed
on the scene until the final
dollar figure was announced.
Also present was native Lex-
ingtonian Jim Fuller, a
muscular dystrophy patient
who supported the students
from their earliest planning ses-
sions last year, and designed

the logo that was used suc-
cessfully in publicizing last
year’s dance marathon.

W&L_ student involvement
was extended well beyond the
150 dancers on the floor; for
every one of them, there was at
least one student counterpart
adding up receipts, serving
refreshments or selling tickets.
And with an audience of nearly
750 people crowding Evans Din-
ing Hall at times, the marathon
rivaled W&L’s annual Dancy
Dress Ball in terms of wall-to-
wall people.

The close of this year’s
marathon was both a jubilant
and poignant moment for co-
chairman Blumberg, who saw
tho event through its earliest
Stages two years ago. He has
spent both years’ 30-hour ses-
sions as master of ceremonies
capering on the stage in full tux-
edo dress and urging the
dancers to stay awake, (In fact,
another college has already
asked him to perform the same
duties later this year at its
dance benefit. )

“The let-down is starting to
set in now,” he admitted on the
day after the dance, ‘‘and it’s
going to be incredibly tough to
leave this behind after two
years of work. At the risk of

Piranesi
Etchings
At duPont

Giovanni Battista Piranesi,
an 18th-century Venetian ar-
chitect whose professional
dreams were never materializ-
ed in a republic already in
decline, is the subject of a new
exhibition in Washington and
Lee University’s duPont
Gallery beginning Monday,
Feb. 4.

In all, 25 etchings are includ-
ed in the show, entitled ‘‘Prints
by Piranesi,’’ co-sponsored by
W&L’s fine arts department
and the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts.

Born in 1720, Piranest came
from a family of stonemasons
and architectural experts, and
as aresult, his education follow-
ed those lines.

The duPont exhibition
includes many of his most noted
projects, including a sketch of
the ‘‘Temple of Apollo’’ and the
“View of the Sepulchral Room
of Lazarus.”

Gallery hours are 9 to 4 each
weekday. There is no admission
charge for the show, which
follows the widely attended
showing of photography by Lex-
ington’s Michael Miley. The
Miley exhibit will close Satur-
day, Feb. 2.

Carmicheal Calls |

For Revolution

(continued from page 1)

He said the American capital-
ist system has reduced students
from having critical minds,
adding that a student needs a
critical outlook so he doesn’t
lose perspective in the world
around him.

‘African students must
understand that they have a
responsibility to organize their
people to fight the oppression,”’
Carmichael said.

In this fight, Carmichael told
them to, ‘‘never look for the
easiest road.”’

“The capitalist system has
taught us to take the road of
least resistance, but we must
look for the roughest road and
fight in any way that is
necessary,” he said.

He said, ‘“‘Those who don’t see
need for the cause have been
blinded by the capitalists.”

Evans

‘To Speak ©

Robert Evans, CBS News cor-
respondent and Moscow bureau
chief for the network, will ap-
pear at Washington and Lee
University next Thursday, Feb.
7, to speak on the topic ‘‘Oil Is
Power.”’ The address is part of
the W&L_ student . body’s
speakers’ series, ‘‘Contact,”
dealing this year with the
dangers and complexities of
current U.S. foreign policy.

In addition to his duties as a
newsman, Evans is well known
as a film and television pro-
ducer.

Evans’ speech will begin at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. It will be
preceded by a reception at 5
p.m. at Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity, 205 E. Washington
St. The public is invited to at-
tend both events.

   
 
  

A contradicting factor to the
gaining of their freedom, ac-
cording to Carmichael, is the
Democratic Party.

“Ever since the 60’s_ the
Democratic Party has been
fooling African masses into see-
ing quantitative progress, but
no qualitative progress: our
legislative power in Washington
was almost nothing in the 60's—
now we have a greater repre-
sentation, but still not enough to
be strong at all,”’ he said.

He said the problems in the
1980’s_ must be solved by
qualitative change, a change he
sees as revolutionary.

“This revolutionary change
must be accomplished by the
masses; history is made by
masses of the people,” Car-
michael said.

“The capitalist sytem has
taught us and let it be thought
that history is made by indivi-
duals like George Washington.
George Washington didn’t beat
the British—it was the support
of the masses that did it,’’ he
said.

“Any people, under any con-
ditions, who are oppressed, will
fight to be free because freedom
is innate and_ instinctively
understood, but,’’ he added, ‘‘it
must be governed by reason.”’

The draft was done away with
by the black people, he said,
because it was they who were
the ones getting drafted
because they were the poorest.

“Johnson tried to maintain
the draft, but it fell apart in the
end because we united and
made it do so; now Carter
wants to bring the draft back
in—Carter’s crazy!’ Car-
michael heatedly said.

He asserted that every war in
American history the blacks
fought in, they got nothing in
return.

‘After the American Revolu-
tion, we were still slaves, and
even after Vietnam, we still
couldn’t find jobs,”’ he said.

‘In the 80's we must get the
masses together and fight and
remember that the secret of life
is to fear nothing,’ he said.

EC Hears Contact Com. Procedures|

(continued from page 1)

Blumberg asked Ridge and
Harpole if they could find so-
meone more responsible.

The EC also. voted
unanimously to have Weiss ap-
pear at the next EC meeting
and explain the incident.

During most of the SAB
report several EC members
pumped away at calculators.

Contact was also called
before the BC Monday night to
explain some of its procedures.
The central question posed by
the EC was the composition of
and role played by the Contact
Committee.

Contact Co-Chairmen Chan-
ning Hall and Scott Cardoza
were on hand to explain their
committee’s activities.

Cardoza said prospective
committee members submitted
applications. He told the EC 20
applications were received and

that he and Hall tried to pick ex- —

perienced upperclassmen and
some underclassmen.

‘We tried to get some people
who were underclassmen to
carry the program on,” said
Cardoza.

He added that a majority of
the people selected had been in-
volved with Contact last year or
spoke to him last spring.

Cardoza said he did not get in
touch with all applicants and
agreed with a suggestion from
Bob Willis, Junior Represen-
tative, that Contact Co-
Chairmen send a letter to all ap-
plicants, whether the applicants
get on the committee or not.

Hall told the EC that Commit-
tee members put up posters and
bulletins, make arrangements
for speakers, hand out bulletins
at Contact presentations and
help write preview articles
about speakers.

Abraham asked the Co-
Chairmen how they select
speakers.

“We kick around some
names,” said Hall. ‘“‘Then we
make a !ot of calls to various
agencies and ask them about
speakers on various topics.”’

The list of possible speakers
dwindles as price and
availability are investigated,
explained Cardoza.

Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould asked Hall and
Cardoza if they had considered

conducting a poll among the
students to determine areas of
interest.

‘Suggestions -+un from’
Playboy ‘Playmate of the
Year’ to Henry Kissinger,’’

said Cardoza. He explained that
Kissinger is too expensive.

‘“T guess what I had in mind
was a list of five people who you
could get an opinion about,”’
said Ould. .

Cardoza told the Committee
that most of this year’s
speakers have been booked, but
added that Ould’s suggestions
should be made to next year’s
Co-Chairmen.

Jay Blumberg asked Cardoza
if he thought Contact should
have greater variety.

“The complaints last year
were the opposite,’ Cardoza
said.

- “Contact was originally made
as a Symposium,”’ he explained.

Willis and Senior Represen-
tative Dee Keesler commended
Cardoza and Hall on their selec-
tion of topic, but expressed con-
cern over Contact’s scheduling.

‘‘T don’t think you could have
picked a better topic, but I think
the problem is the scheduling of
the program,”’ said Willis.

“IT must commend you on
your stretching the money and
making it go a long way,” said
Keesler.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole said Contact might be
able to generate more interest
in its program if it had a
speaker in the fall.

Willis suggested that Contact
and the Mock Convention get
together so they do not book
overlapping speakers. _

The EC also expressed in-
terest in Contact’s providing
more publicity for its program.

‘Jay mentioned putting up a
poster with the theme and
speakers sponsored by Con-
tact,” Ould said.

Hall and Cardoza said they
will get a poster made.

After hearing reports from
several clubs to which it gave
money in the fall, the EC

discussed revisions of the
pamphlet which explains
plagiarism.

When the EC finishes debate
on the pamphlet, it will
distrubute copies of the revision
around campus to see what

students think about the
changes.

Willis and Keesler, who have
worked with faculty members
on the revised pamphlet, said
the new one would be shorter
and more relevant than the pre-
sent edition, which is 15-years-
old.

The EC approved three ques-
tions for a questionnaire, to be
conducted on the phone, about
co-education at Washington and
Lee.

EC Vice President Les Cotter
and Blumberg said they think
the survey, which will be con-
ducted on 10 percent of W&L
students, should be accurate.

The Fencing Club reported to
the EC on the large expenses it
faces and the steps it is taking
to meet those expenses.

Colt Puryear, who spoke for
the club, said it is holding a raf-
fle to raise money and has also
received donations.

He said the Club will need
more money if it is going to con-
tinue.

The Fencing Club can apply
for intercollegiate competition
next year, but it cannot play
matches in the Warner Center.

“Dick Miller will not let us
use the gym for home meets,”
said Puryear.

Poole told Puryear that the
University Athletic Committee
might be able to help the team
get permission to play in the
sym.

Alex Richards gave a detailed
five-page report to the EC and
requested more money.

“IT would like to commend
Alex for getting the show on the
road,” said Abraham.

“The attitude and morale of
the team has improved ten-
fold,” said Richards.

The EC said it will consider
Richard's request at its next
meeting.

IFC Reminds Frats
To Get Act Together

by Ross Newell

Washington and Lee’s Inter-
fraternity Council, Tuesday
night, reminded fraternities
that it is time to get their act
together for the administration.

Inspection checklists are due
in Dean Danny N. Murphy’s of-
fice at 4p.m. today. Syd Farrar,
IFC President, said spot inspec-
tions are scheduled for this Fri-
day. Fraternities that fail the
inspection are usually placed on
social probation.

However, recently some
fraternities have appealed their
probation and won reversals
from the Student Affairs Com-
mittee because they claimed
that they were not aware that
the checklists were due. Farrar
said that the committee will no
longer consider appeals based
on this excuse.

Also, fraternities received
from the administration this
fall a list of projects designed to
improve the houses’ exterior
appearance. A letter detailing
the progress made on the top
priority project is due in Mur-
phy’s office at 4 p.m. Friday.
Farrar said that if no progress
has been made the letter should
detail the reasons for this lack
of progress.

In another matter, the IFC
repeated its stance on hazing of
fraternity pledges. Farrar said
that a second fraternity has
been questioned on pledging ac-
tivities and that all fraternties
should be aware of the IFC haz-
ing rules before they conduct in-
itiation rituals.

Finally, a spokesman for the
dance marathon committee
thanked fraternities for thier
help in making the event a suc-
cess. Kegs donated by frater-
nities were important in helping
to defray the costs of the

 

marathon, the spokesman said.
_ During the marathon, the
IFC, through Farrar, was the
highest bidder, $45. on a pie
thrown at Edward L. Pinney, a
politics professor. Farrar said
he got a good shot at Pinney ad-
ding that the professor fired
back at him and left a substan
tial portion of the pie in his hair

Four W&L
Seniors In
Business

Competition

Four seniors in Washington
and Lee University’s School of
Commerce, Economics and
Politics—Robert Marshall Mer-
riman Jr., Raymond Charles
Nugent, Mark Grahame Walker
and David Walter West—will
form one of 24 collegiate teams
competing in the 15th annual
computer-simulation business
competition at Emory Universi-
ty this winter.

Sponsored by Emory’s
Graduate Business Association
with financial support from
local and national firms, the
game offers participants a
chance to test their skills of
management, finance, market

analysis and basic economics °

While ‘‘operating’’ an
imaginary company.

In this year’s version of the
game, the stockholders of a fail-
ing fertilizer firm have remov-
ed the company’s directors and
replaced them with new
managers in an attempt to re-
establish a profit margin. The
student group which is able to
achieve the greatest profit in
the computer competition will
be the 1980 champion.

"REVIEW and OUTLOOK.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

On Banning Bands

Yesterday’s Univereity Council meeting raised a
number of disturbing questions. The purpose of the
UC meeting was to consider two Student Affairs Com-
mittee proposals: the first, prohibiting live bands at
fraternity parties during weeknights; and the second,
banning live bands in the Cockpit on weeknights.
Members of SAC and the UC speaking in favor of the
proposals to ban live bands were clutching at straws
in an attempt to legislate a change in student at-
titudes at Washington and Lee.

There is a feeling among many faculty members of
the faculty that students at W&L do not believe in the
academic purposes of college life and those faculty
members are casting about in an attempt to locate the
possible sources where they think the problem
manifests itself. The primary attack has been on the
fraternities, of course. But when the students find
other diversions that are not deemed by the wise ones
as befitting their impression of what students should
be, those diversions are also attacked.

But mainly the fraternities are attacked, and their
chief assailant has been Dr. Merchant, a member of
the SAC, the UC, and now, faculty advisor to the Inter-
fraternity Council. Few faculty members have mat-
ched the zeal which Dr. Merchant has demonstrated
in attacking the fraternities—a circumstance which
brings to mind some important questions. Should Dr.
Merchant, who has proven himself opposed to frater-
nity social aotivities, be advisor to the body which
legislates and passes judgment on fraternity con-
duct? Did the fraternity representatives to the IFC
realize what they were doing when Dr. Merchant was
named IFC advisor? Is there a conflict of interest for

Dr. Merchant to represent the faculty position in SAC _

meetings and the fraternity position in IFC matters
when they are seemingly in conflict? It seems ironic
to us that a professor who has consistently taken a
hardline stand against W&L’s fraternities should be
named as the advisor to the entire fraternity system.

Even more disturbing, possibly embarrassing, was
the conduct of IFC President Syd Farrar. Earlier this
year Farrar’s IFC mishandled a discipline case in-
volving several members of the same fraternity. The
students should have been sent to the Student Control

Committee and not received additional punishment

from the SAC. But they did, and their fraternity
brothers were punished for the actions of a few
members who were not acting on the house’s behalf.

Just what is the position of the IFC President in this
matter of the bands ban? This is not easily answered.
In the SAC meeting Farrar voted in favor of the two
proposals; that is he voted against the fraternities he
supposedly represents. But in the open public meeting
yesterday Farrar opposed the fraternity bands ban
and abstained on the Cockpit bands ban—a very dif-
ferent reaction from his voting posture when alone
with administration and faculty members at the SAC
meeting.

Frankly, we don’t know what to make of Farrar’s
voting shifts, which seem motivated by the audience
he is playing to. We cannot ascertain to whom Farrar
owes his allegiance—the faculty and administration
or the students who elected him IFC President. He
told us last night that he voted in favor of the bands
ban at the SAC meeting because of ‘‘a bargain,’’ but
he would not elaborate. Unfortunately, this whole in-
cident has made Farrar look like a puppet of the ad-
ministration. We imagine that several IFC represen-
tatives will have some very pointed questions to ask
their President about his turnaround voting habits.

The Editor

 

SAB Meetings Are Not ‘A Circus’

Dear Editor,

I found your article last week
on the conduct of SAB meetings
to be very interesting. The arti-
cle quoted Jay Blumberg as
saying “The (SAB) meetings
are run like a circus, they are
very unorganized and there
could be some improvement.”’

Although I am a freshmen
and probably can’t grasp all the
intricate workings of student

government, I fail to see how
the EC and more specifically
Jay Blumberg could possibly
know whether our meetings are
“‘unorganized”’ or not.

I make this statement to br-
ing to your attention the atten-
dance record of the EC repre-
sentative to the SAB, Jay
Blumberg. To the best of my
knowledge, Jay Blumberg nor
any EC representative has been
at an SAB meeting since the
first of November.

Unless Jay Blumberg has
some divine gift that permits
him to monitor our meetings
without his presence and that
we mere mortals know nothing
about, I believe that regular at-
tendance by the EC represen-
tative would reveal a method to
our madness.

I am neither confirming nor
denying the alleged ‘‘unorganiz-
ed’’ conduct of our meetings,
but I am saying that we get

A Sense Of Sacrifice

I’m amazed and shocked by
some of the reactions I have
heard from my fellow students
concerning Mr. Carter’s an-

nouncement of the possibility of’

registration for the draft.

No sooner does the President
hop off the tube that people
around here start planning
vacations to Canada, Old frac-
tures start to hurt again. Feet
that were fine for dancing just
last weekend suddenly seem
flat. Pre-meds become popular
as students want to know,
hypothetically of course, the
least damaging method of pass-
ing a bullet through one’s foot.

Even the surrounding girls’
schools are not immune to this
new spirit. The forces of pink
and green have, for the most
part, reaffirmed their desire to
spend a happy existence bring-
ing up baby and spending Dad-
dy’s and/or  husband’s
paycheck. The Equal Rights
Amendment, not so long ago a
popular battle-cry, seems to
have vanished with the know-
ledge that there is no
Papagallos section of the Army

day of next week,

In short, no one seems willing
to pay the price of maintaining
freedom and democracy in our
society. There is no sense of
responsibility of sacrifice. Peo-
ple are just out after their own
self-interest.

Well, I’m sick of that sort of
attitude. I’m willing to do my
part. Why, if my asthma wasn’t
so bad, I’d probably enlist to-
day. As it is, however, I’ll do
what I can, Even though I can’t

serve actively, I can help out.

If a draftee’s wife or girl-
friend is lonely, I’ll comfort her.
If they need people to serve on
the draft boards, I’ll be there.
Bonds to finance the fight? I’ll
buy more than my share from
the wages I'll receive in the
opened-up job market.

I’m willing to do my part in
keeping this great country go-
ing, Isn’t it about time that you
make the same commitment?

To the Editor,

Who decides what a store
sells? The letter in the Ring-
tum Phi last week from J.
Cabell Acree highlighted the
primary problem and pleasure
of all store managers. Cabell
Acree is right that the customer
should have a say (with his
money) in what is sold. But
behind that lies the standard
and image which the manager
sets for the establishment
he/she runs. ;

Certainly, nobody can stock
everything, so from the beginn-
ing, choice and discrimination
set in. A gathering of college
store managers can talk—even
shout—round the clock about
what to place on sale in their
stores. What sells, yes, but

 

To Hangings Complaint

there is a point beyond which...
It is a matter of taste and quali-
ty.
In books, the crisis is over
obscenity. (Not that I think the
banner will upset Cabell Acree
is obscene, it seems to me just
tacky). Even the Supreme
Court has a crack at obscenity.
“Of no redeeming literary,
social or intellectual merit”’
was their guideline in the Miller
decision. So it is up to the
managers to’set their own stan-
dards of quality for the kind of
store they want to run. We keep
an eye on that bottom line, but
we won’t be trashy about it.

As so often, Oscar Wilde said
it best: “There is no such thing
as obscenity, there is only bad
taste.”’

Letters To The Editor

Bookstore Manager Responds

Is Syd Farrar ‘Passing The Buck’?

To The Editor,

I would like to comment on the IFC meeting of
Monday, Jan. 21. I was not at the meeting but I did
read the Ring-tum Phi account on Thursday of
that week. I am assuming that the Phi story is cor-
rect.

The Judicial Board of the IFC heard a case
where two Fiji’s threw snowballs at the Pika
house, resulting in some broken windows. The Fi-
ji’s then became the subject of return fire from the
Pika house, which consisted of snowballs and
pellets from a BB gun. The Fiji’s entered the Pika
house to find the person who was firing the BB gun
and a fight ensued. The Fiji’s were shown the door
and they proceeded to their house to round up
some ‘‘brothers,”’ at which time the mustered Fiji
group marched back to the Pika house. Police
were called to the scene to prevent a fight at the
Pika house.

Syd Farrar, president of the IFC, commented at
the Judicial Board meeting that since no fight ac-
tually broke out between the two groups, the case

was not within the jurisdiction of the IFC. He sug-
gested that it was a matter for the Student Control
Committee.

Is Syd Farrar serious or is he merely passing
the buck? Does the IFC need a couple of smashed
faces or a broken limb or two before it can pass
judgment on an altercation of this nature?
Regardless of whether blows were exchanged or
not, is this the type of conduct the IFC condones
for fraternity members (or for anybody )?

I would suggest that one would not need a J.D.
degree to understand that the behavior of these
people is not consistent with any code of conduct in
a civilized society. If the IFC continues to neglect
the responsibility of insuring at least civilized
behavior from fraternity members, then the
fraternity system is destined to continue in the
descending spiral it is now in. If Syd Farrar is
merely passing the buck, then why bother with
having an IFC at all?

 

 

“More On

Dear Sir:

I have delayed writing this
letter in the hope that someone
else would address the issue.
Seeing that no one else has, it is
my hope that you will print this
letter despite its anonymity.
Unfortunately, I am in a posi-
tion where it is best that no one
can identify this as my opinion.
I should note, however, that I do
not personally know any of the
people I am about to discuss.

I am writing in regard to the
‘‘Boxwood Incident.’’ I am not
writing about the severity of the
penalty, for I am not a party to
all the facts and cannot act as
judge and jury. I am writing to
express my displeasure with
the way the problem was handl-
ed by the University Communi-
ty.
Several W&L students (I use
the term ‘‘students’’ and not
“basketball players’’) were in-
volved in some vandalism on
campus. The Student Control
Committee handled the matter
in its usual manner, and punish-
ed the students. In addition, the
Athletic Committee also took
the matter into consideration,
and handed out an additional

penalty.

A quick glance at the Student

Handbook will evidence that the
Athletic Committee has only a
general power to offer advice.
On the other hand, the Student
Control Committee was specifi-
cally established to control stu-
dent conduct.

The SCC’s jurisdiction ex-
tends to any University related
activity, and it may impose any
one or more of an extensive list
of penalties. These penalties in-
clude prohibiting participation
in any athletic event. (See
Penalty (d), page nine of the
1979-1980 Student Handbook. )

It is clear that the SCC was
established to handle student
misconduct such as the ‘‘Box-
wood Incident.’”’ It is not so
clear that the Athletic Commit-
tee was intended to have juris-
diction over student misconduct
of this nature.

Admittedly, the Athletic Com-

ro mo Me Oe He Oe

‘ might be

1094 Wh Ow Oe Oe ee ee

The Handling Of The Boxwood

mittee has an interest in the out-
come, but the SCC is more
suited to finding the facts and
less likely to be influenced by
outside pressure. The Athletic
Committee should have yielded
to the SCC.

Although I believe this was a
matter for Student Control, the
Athletic Committee’s assump-
tion of jurisdiction would not
bother me as much if they were
the only committee involved.
Only one organization should
have retained jurisdiction, and
that organization should have
had exclusive power to dispose
of the matter.

The result of concurrent
jurisdiction over punishment is
that the students are placed in
the position of continually
defending their actions. Such
double jeopardy was outlawed
by the U.S. Constitution
because of the inherent pro-
bability of vengeful punish-
ment. I think it is obvious that
the additional penalty was no
more than an extra kick in the
behind to make sure the
students felt it.

What is there to stop the
Library Committee from ex-
cluding these students from
entering the library, or the
Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee from excluding © these
students from its activities? If
the Athletic Committee can
have its turn at the students,
why can’t everyoneelse?. ..

I’m sure that the Athletic
Committee can make some sort
of argument that if the students
can’t behave at W&L, they they
won’t behave on the road, But
this reasoning is only, good
enough to suspend them from
away games. No matter how it
rationalized, the
Athletic Committee imposed an
additional punishment.

I keep referring to, the
Athletic Committee’s decision,
but it was really (at least
ultimately) President Huntley’s
decision. No one overruled the
SCC. The President did how-
ever, sidestep the SCC. This of
course enhances his image with

eter ae®

 

the Alumni and the faculty as a

stern administrator, but his ac-

tions are also a statement of no
confidence in the SCC.

President Huntley reacted to

, public opinion, and very neatly

avoided a confrontation with

students by using another com-

~ mittee as a cover. (It’s even

- questionable . whether’ the
- Athletic Committee had such
- broad power). He did overrule
G the SCG, although not express-
2 ly; his actions cut into the SCC’s
~ power, .

_$ Huntley could not possible have

taken. President

; If you do not see President
« Huntley’s action as a threat to
, your ‘student’ irights, you are
‘ probably not alone. The Presi-
dent has only taken away a tiny
little bit of the SCC’s power.
This loss may never hurt you,
but it has hurt your fellow
students. They have had to pay
for their actions—twice.

Incident

Has Justice Been Done?

Dear Sir:

Has justice been done in the
now infamous W&L boxwood in-
cident? Looking at the situation
from the view of the defendants,
I say ‘‘no.”’

Sure, what the students did
was wrong. But, it’s also wrong
that the school painted itself in-
to a corner by making the case
a media event. It’s wrong that
as we lose: to the likes of
Eastern Mennonite, Carby Hoy
and Pete Farrell (certainly not
a pair of hardened convicts) are
not representing us on the
basketball court. It’s wrong
that on the weekends Ken
Manganiello and Rob McDevitt
are condemned to walk the
streets of Lexington for enter-
tainment.

The ‘‘powers that be’’ may
contend that the punishment
was largely intended to serve as
a deterrent to any such future
incidents. I can agree that the
“‘sentence’’ had to be more than
just restitution for the
damages. But how much more?
And, in this case repayment is

no small matter. Student Con-
trol simply went overboard. A
“slap on the wrist,’’ some peo-
ple called it? I say it was more
like a shotgun blast in the face.

It seems to me that no one in
the administration has _ put
himself in the defendant’s
shoes. They are not malicious
rednecks—they must have
character or they wouldn’t be
here in the first place. And, they
do have feelings—how would
you feel having their punish-
ment?

If the Student Control was
afraid that showing leniency
would make the university look
weak and establish a bad prece-
dent, then let me ask this—if
tomorrow a student is found
guilty of breaking a window in
the same circumstances as the
“W&L 10,” am I correct in
assuming that he will re eive
the same punishment?

For his s?’ 2, I certainly hope
the answ, 10.”

Sincerely,
Jim Hess

UC Kills Bands Ban

(continued from page 1)

decided to them
separately.

Dr. Merchant said SAC was
striving for consistency by ban-
ning mid-week bands at both
fraternities and in the Cockpit.
“Once we decided to cut out live
music at fraternities, we decid-
ed to end discrimination,’ he
said.

University Center Committee
member David Blackwood said
the UC, to be consistent, would
have to cut out all diversions
during the week, such as Con-
tact speakers and classical
music performances. By not do-
ing so, the UC was only
demonstrating its prejudice
toward Cockpit entertainment.
Blackwood and Guy Steuart,
another UCC member, said the
Cockpit bands give many peo-
ple a form of cultural ex-
perience, providing a number of
diverse types of music.

Dr. Evans replied that it was
ridiculous to try to find a link
between classical concerts or
lectures and bands in the
Cockpit. ‘One cannot say a lec-
ture is the same educational
value as ‘bar music,“ he said.

When the accusation of
cultural bias came up again,
Dr. Merchant interupted with,
“Of course I’m culturally bias-
ed! That's why I'm here.”’

Student Control Chairman
Tim Brooks asked what pro-
blem would be corrected by
banning bands from the
Cockpit.

Dr. Merchant said, ‘*You're
here to put in five good days of
studying a week. I can't see the
need for entertainment during
the week.”

Dr. Pinney said he objected to
the use of University money for
Cockpit bands. But UCC chair-
man Jamie Small, who books
the bands, said that less than
$3,500 was psent on mid-week
bands during the first semester
and much of that was off-set by
funds collected from cover
charges. He later said he
figured about 40 cents per stu-
dent was used in University
funds to put the bands in the
cockpit.

Student Body President Steve
Abraham said he felt the large
scale diversion aspect was
false. He said the distinction
between restrictions on frater-
nity functions and restrictions
on Cockpit functions is that with
the latter, the attack is on the
student body, not just a small
part of it as when one attacks
the fraternities.

Howard L. Boetsch, a faculty
member on the UC, said, ‘We
sponsor basketball games dur-
ing the week. We are deceiving
ourselves if we say there is no
difference between fraternity
parties and Cockpit activities.”

Several people pointed out
that many of the students atten-
ding the Cockpit bands only
stay for a while for a ‘study
break,’ Blackwood said the
bands finish playing by 11:30
p.m. and the Cockpit closes at
midnight and that there is not
the lingering type of party at-
mosphere that exist at fraterni-
ty parties.

The UC conducted no further
business after voting down the
two proposals.
