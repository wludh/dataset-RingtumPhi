IFC VotesDown

New
Fraternity

by Ed Edge

The Interfraternity Council
voted 9-4 not to accept the newly
proposed fraternity, ACACIA,
Tuesday night in its second vote
on the issue.

Two weeks ago the IFC voted
to accept the new fraternity, but
the vote did not comply with the
council’s constitution, which re-
quires a three-quarters majori-
ty vote in favor of acceptance
before a new fraternity can be
admitted into the IFC.

The first vote was 9-4-3 in
favor of allowing the new fra-
ternity in, but the IFC was
under the false assumption that
only a simple majority was
needed to accept the new group.

ACACIA was to be a service
fraternity, but its local
organizer, Stan Doobin, wanted
it made clear that the fraternity
was also to be socially-oriented.

“We want to get involved in
the community as much as pos-
sible and act as a bridge be-
tween the townspeople and the
fraternities; we are not strictly
a service fraternity, though,”
said Doobin.

In other business, IFC Presi-
dent Monte Brisoce informed
the council of the Student Af-
fairs Committee’s decision to
retain the pledge required of

fraternity presidents at the end
of a period of social probation.

The pledge is required of the
president of the fraternity com-
ing off of probation and states
that the fraternity has complied
with the terms of probation.

The pledge has been revised,
however, to begin with the
words, ‘‘To the best of my
knowledge...’ This revision was
the subject of concern for some
representatives at the meeting
and was initiated by the Presi-
dent of the Executive Commit-
tee, Steve Abraham.

‘‘All the pledge rule is doing is
causing the students to be
sneaky; girls are always going
to be around during probation
and the pledge is going to cause
the presidents to lie,” Mac Ken-
nedy, a Beta Theta Pi member,

 

said.

Several other fraternity
representatives echoed Ken-
nedy’s point.

A possible alternative that
was looked into was to let the
sophomores, who live in the
fraternity house, have their
girlfriends come visit them, but
have no parties.

SAC members, according to
Briscoe, were apprehensive
about this because it would be
too difficult to distinguish be-
tween a party anda visit.

“SAC decided to keep the
pledge in because there was no
viable enough alternative of-
fered, and I think the matter
should be taken up next year
when more work can be done on
it,”’ Briscoe said.

Renovation To Begin

In

by Ed Gonsalves

Beginning in the fall of 1981
Washington and Lee University
will start renovating Graham-
Lees dormitory. The move will
satisfy Virginia fire codes and
improve the safety, health and
overall conditions.

According to Frank Parsons,
assistant to the President, the
University has taken so long in
improving the conditions of
Graham-Lees because the
renovation will be = ‘‘an
unglamourous and disruptive
chore.”

But Parsons also admitted
that the “University has a
responsibility” to keep the dor-
mitories updated with respect
to safety, health and comfort.

The renovation is currently in
the schematic stage and the
Board of Trustees will consider

all the proposals this weekend.
Ul,

The Board must consider the
method of renovation as well as
the displacement of students
that the renovation will cause,
said Parsons.

Alternative methods of
renovation include refurbishing
one section of Graham-Lees at a
time.

“This is the easiest way to
handle the displacement of
students,’’ said Parsons, but

September

would lenghen the entire
renovation process, which the
University wants to be cun-
pleted by the fall of 1982.

One must also consider the
reduced capacity that renova-
tion requires. Fire escapes
would take up a lot of room
space, Says Parsons.

To get around this problem, a
proposed method is to fill in the
current ‘‘donut’’ (quad) of
Graham-Lees.

Another scheme is to build a
new dormitory behind the ten-
nis courts near Wilson Field.
Costs for the renovation have
been estimated to run as high as
$3 million.

This method would solve the
problem of where to put the
students while the im-
provements are made _ to
Graham-Lees.

Freshmen can also use Woods
Creek Apartments. But this
would only take care of about
2/3 of the freshmen class.

Of course, this would force
upperclassmen to live in town.
However, Parsons said this
wouldn’t be a problem.

In addition he stated that
more W&L students used to live
in town than do now.

 

Dr. Emmons Retlects On Changes

by Will Jackson

unanimous.”

 

Most present-day Washington and Lee students
were still in diapers if not, as yet, unborn, when
Lyman Randlett Emmons arrived, fresh from
receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia,
to begin teaching biology here.

Twenty years have brought a lot of changes,
positive and negative, to the world at large and to
W&L in particular. Professor Emmons has seen
these changes as they evolved, and gave a few of
his opinions on them during a recent interview.

Emmons began his academic career in New
England, where he was born and raised. After
high school, he entered Trinity College in Hart-
ford, Conn., a college which Emmons termed
‘very much the same”’ as W&L — at least at the
time. An all male, relatively small school, adher-
ing to the liberal arts tradition, Trinity differed
from W&L mainly in its northern location and
lesser emphasis on the fraternity scene.

At Trinity about a third as many students were
in fraternities as are here, primarily because in
Hartford, “alternatives in social life were not so
restricted as in Lexington.’’ Nonetheless, ‘‘it was
considered a privilege to live in a fraternity,’’ and
because members desired to maintain that privi-
lege, ‘there was less of the silliness’ that

sometimes seems to predominate among W&L’s
fraternities.

Today Trinity College remains a very similar
school to Washington and Lee, with one crucial dif-
ference. Trinity went coed in 1969, a move which
Emmons thinks W&L would do well to emulate.
‘“‘We want to have an institution of exceptional
people,”’ says Emmons, ‘But we're limiting
ourselves to half the market of bright students
who'd come to W&L.”’

A Fall 1979 issue of the Trinity Reporter hangs
on a wall opposite Emmons’ professorially clut-
tered Parmly Hall office, near: the stuffed
platypus. The issue deals with the tenth anniver-
sary of Trinity’s coeducation and contains infor-
mation which seems very pertinent to W&L’s cur-
rent, occasionally heated, debate on the subject.

Apparently at Trinity, the decision to coeducate
was made so quickly that the time for heated
debate was limited.

Theodore D. Lockwood, who had just become
the college’s president in 1969, is quoted in the
Reporter as saying, ‘Early in our discussions, it
became apparent that we weren’t talking about
whether the college should go coed, but rather
when and in what numbers. When the time came
to vote, the decision to admit women was

Within four months after consideration of
coeducation had begun at Trinity, recruitment of
women began. There were some minor initial dif-
ficulties when the first batch of women arrived on
campus the following fall.

There was some growling from alumni, though
annual giving continued to increase. The women
faced occasional male antagonism and a lack of
full-length mirrors and shower curtains. The men
were startled when the women started making
road trips of their own.

From a decade’s perspective, however, the con-
sensus, agreed upon by Emmons, is that Trinity’s
coeducation has been a real success, creating not
only a diverse student body, but also “‘other, in-
tangible, benefits such as a livelier intellectual at-
mosphere and a more natural social environ-
ment.”

According to the Reporter, “Perhaps the
greatest tribute to the success of the venture at
Trinity is that those faculty and administrators
who have known the college both as a single-sex
institution and as it is today have difficulty
remembering what it was like before the women
came. ‘Except that it’s better now,’ one faculty

Library Dedication

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will formally dedicate its
new $9-million undergraduate
library in a series of events this
Friday and Saturday.

The University board of
trustees has invited the public
to be its guests at a reception
Friday evening at 8:30 in the
main lobby of the library,
located immediately behind
historic Washington Hall.

The two-day dedication
celebration will begin earlier
Friday when Warren J. Haas,
president of the Council on
Library Resources Inc., speaks
in the Mary Moody Northen
Auditorium on the first lower
level in the library. He will
deliver his remarks at 11:30
a.m.

The Council on Library
Resources is a private founda-
tion, created in 1956 and sup-
ported since then by the Ford
Foundation, whose purpose is to
help find solutions of problems
of libraries in general and of
academic and_ research
libraries in particular.

Saturday’s events will focus
on the actual dedication of the
new undergraduate library, as
Dr. Edgar F. Shannon Jr.,

Law Students

To Graduate
Sunday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law will award
103 juris doctor degrees during
commencement exercises this
Sunday at 4:30 p.m. on the
historic Front Campus.

The public is invited to attend
the ceremony, which will take
place under the trees in front of
Robert E. Lee’s home, weather
permitting. If it should rain, the
ceremony will take place in Lee
Chapel.

Washington and Lee’s
undergraduate commencement
will take place June 5. The
reason for the earlier law
graduation is the difference in
the academic calendars be-
tween the law school and the
undergraduate divisions.

The law school remains on a
two-semester system, while the
undergraduate schools are on a
three-term, 12-12-6 week
system, and their spring-term
examinations do not conclude
until June 2.

The speaker at Sunday:s law
commencement will be W&L
president Robert E.R. Huntley.
By long-standing tradition at
Washington and Lee, the presi-
dent delivers the principal
graduation addresses.

A reception for the law
graduates, their family and
guests, faculty and alumni, will
follow the graduation
ceremony.

LH

former president of the Univer-
sity of Virginia, now president
of the federated chapters of Phi
Beta Kappa and Com-
monwealth professor of English

at U.Va., delivers principal
remarks at an 11:30 a.m.
ceremony.

The public is also invited to
attend that event, which will
take place on the new walkway
at the rain entrance to the
library. If the weather should
be bad, the ceremony will be
moved into the main lobby.

W&L moved into the new
library 15 months ago. This
weekend’s ceremonies coincide
with the regular spring meeting
on campus of the university
board.

The new library has shelf
space for half a_ million
volumes. Currently, W&L’s
undergraduate library collec-
tion numbers about 400,000
volumes, although some of
those holdings are located in
departmental libraries in the
natural sciences and in jour-
nalism.

W&L students and other users
of the library also have free ac-
cess to an additional 200,000
volumes in the Wilbur C. Hall
Library of the W&L law school.

The library is open 24 hours a

day when undergraduate
classes are in session.

Construction on the new
library was begun in mid-1976.
The architects were Marcellus
Wright, Cox & Smith of Rich-
mond, the firm that also design-
ed Lewis Hall, W&L’s four-
year-old law building. Bass
Construction Co. Inc., also of
Richmond, was the general con-
tractor.

Although it is a five-story
structure, the library was built
down into Wood’s Creek Valley,
and the roofline is only as high
as the first floor of Washington
Hall. The site, the scale, ex-
terior design, and_ building
materials, red brick and white
concrete vertical accents, com-
plement the neo-Classical ar-
chitecture of the historic Colon-
nade buildings behind which the
library is situated.

In a remark in a booklet the
university is publishing to mark
the library dedication, E. Mar-
shall Nuctxols Jr., rector (chair-
man) of the W&L_ board,
describes the library as “‘func-
tionally efficient (and) ar-
chitecturally distinguished,”’
and says it has already become
the “‘intellectual second home”’
of W&L’s professors and stu-
dent body.

EC Hears
Year End Reports

by Kevin Kirby

Year end reports from the
clubs and committees on the
W&L campus were presented to
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night.

Contact Chairman Channing
Hall told the EC that speakers
fees for the academic year
totaled $7,250.

He said this cost was as high
as it was because a plane had to
be chartered to fly Army Chief
of Staff William C. Westmore-
land to Lexington to speak
before the Washington and Lee
University community.

Hall noted that the committee
ended the academic year with a
$3,444.35 surplus in its account.

He said that this was due to
the unexpected low cost in
bringing Tom Wolfe to speak in
Lee Chapel.

“] don’t think this year’s
surplus should be reason for
lessening Contact’s budget next
year,’’ said Hall. We were just
lucky to get Tom Wolfe for next
to nothing.”’

He cited unsuccessful at-
tempts at getting choice
speakers for the Spring Term as
another reason why Contact’s
surplus account was high.

EC Junior Representative
Bob Willis moved that disperse-
ment of Contact funds revert
back to a reseve account which

Herrick To Head Economics

Bruce Hale Herrick, current-
ly associate professor of
economics at the University of
California at Los Angeles, will
become professor of economics
and head of the department at
Washington and Lee University
next fall.

Dr. Herrick will succeed E’
Claybrook Griffith as depart-
ment head at W&L and will
serve a five-year term in that
administrative capacity.

Dr. Griffith, 65, is retiring at
the end of the 1979-80 academic
year.

The incoming department
head is a native of Minnesota
and received his A.B. degree
with distinction from Carleton
College there.

He earned his Ph.D. in
economics from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1964,
and joined the UCLA faculty in
that year. In addition to his
teaching duties, he is also chair-
man of the UCLA economics
department’s graduate com-
mittee.

Herrick is a member of
several professional societies
including the American
Economic Association, the
Royal Economic Society and
the Society for International
Development.

At UCLA he has_ been
associate dean of the Graduate
Division, coordinator of the

EC President Steve Abraham
explained held all excess money
in univesity accounts during the
summer.

“This will encourage future
committees to get their money
back in the early summer or as

He added that Contact could
pay bills encountered during
the summer out of the reserve
fund and have its negative
balance reimbursed in the fall.

The Film Society showed nine
films this year at a cost of
$1,525, Jay Diesing told the EC.

He said the Society had $25

Diesing listed $950 in contri-
butions to the film Society and a
$600 grant from the EC as the
source of financial backing for
the 1979-1980 academic year.

The English Club reported to
the EC that because of adver-
tisement in advance, among
other things, club activities this
past academic year were well
attended.

When asked by EC President
STeve Abraham if the club con-
sidered charging dues, a
spokesman responded, ‘‘The
club thought about charging
English Club members dues;
but only nine people showed up
at the first meeting and because
funds were received from the
EC and outside sources, there
was no shortage of funds and

thus, no need to charge dues.”’

A Look At The 70’s

by Malcolm Kendall

The bicentenial year, 1976, started off well,
when Mr. John Lee Pratt left twenty percent of his
estate, the equivalent of eleven million dollars, to
Washington and Lee. Mr. Pratt, a prominent
business executive, died at the age of 96 and left
the money to W&L under the conditions that it be
used for scholarships to outstanding students, and
to increase salaries of faculty.

When the SAB signed the Spinners for Spring
Weekend in 1976, the rock fans protested. The rock
fans felt that soul fans had had enough perfor-
mances for one year, while rock fans had not hada
concert to satisfy them.

Rock fans argued that the Spinners were only
playing an hour and a half away the night before in
Charlottesville, if anyone wanted to go see them.

In defence the SAB said that they had tried to
get a good rock band, but they were either too ex-
pensive or already booked, and that they had only
sponsored two soul bands that year.

The SAB went ahead with the concert, and to the
disappointment of the rock fans, the Spinners
were a great success.

Of all the events this year, the Mock Convention
had to be the biggest and most successful. The 1976
Mock Convention not only nominated Georgia
Gov. Jimmy Carter as the Democratic Presiden-

tial Nominee, but also correctly chose Senator
Walter Mondale as his running mate.

There were a few celebrities on campus that
year also. They included Truman Capote as a
guest Contact speaker. George C. Scott also
visited our campus, filming a documentary on
Robert E. Lee’s post-Civil War years as president
of Washington and Lee, which aired on NBC.

George Stadler, an SAE pledge, did not think
much of the 1977 school year, when his costume
made out of cotton adhesive tape caught fire,
engulfing him in flames. Unable to put the flames
out himself, he was immediately assisted by those
standing near by.

He was taken to Stonewall Jackson Hospital and
later transferred to the University of Virginia
burn center, where he was released a few days
later.

In protest over stricter marijuana rules set
down by the Student Control committee, EC
member Rick Goddard lit up and smoked what
looked like a joint. Goddard felt that the new rules
were “foolish” because they only applied to the
dorms and pot.

He was quoted as saying, “‘I’ll give my key to
anyone who wants to smoke in the EC room.”

ner visited W&L as a Contact speaker, and spoke
on his philosophy for succeeding in sports. The Phi
was quoted as saying that he was ‘‘greeted with an
ovation only second to that given his wife
Christe.’ Elizabeth Taylor was also a guest
speaker.

The Law School was also dedicated that year.

The basketball team was ranked 2nd in the
NCAA Division III, finishing the season with a 21-2
record, but lost in the first round of the Division III
tournament.

Coincidentally, eighty Boxwood bushes were
given to the University by Wilmer S. Poiner, Jr.

In the spring of ’77 the Phi listed all of the ‘gut
courses” available, so students could maintain, as
they put it, ‘‘a road trip-party-lacrosse game to
studying ratio.”’

The courses ranged from Art 101 to Computer
Science 100, giving the handbook description, then
their own...“‘easy.”’

The 1978 school year started in controversy over
Charlie Hulfish, the SAB co-chairman, who had
taken out a loan for $175 from the SAB the year
before. He was to have paid it back within two
weeks, but had not.

Rock Goddard, an EC member who had found
out about the loan, wanted to have Hulfish kicked
off the SAB and pay the money back with interest.

After an “emotional and tensewrought’”’ EC
meeting Hulfish was retained by a 5-4 vote, only to
resign his position a few months later, and have to
leave school.

Contact also got into trouble with the EC by

By a unanimous vote the EC took back $590 from
Contact. This had also been the responsibility of
EC member Rick Goddard, who resigned a month
later, because it took up too much time. He had
been responsible for more than 75% of all the EC
motions.

The basketball team had another great year,
and were 22-6 for the season, but only won their
first round game in the NCAA Division ITI tourna-
ment. Coach Verne Canfield was named the
District III, Division III coach of the year.

for Division II and III by the Roanoke Sports Club,
which consists mainly of sports writers.

He was also first team ODAC and MVP in the
Atlantic Division III play-offs.

As the 1978 year began in controversy it also
ended in it, with the “‘Rank-Tam Poon.” This was
the lampoon issue of the Ring-tum Phi which the
administration labled as ‘‘distasteful, disgusting,
and a disgrace to the University.” It was thought
that the administration also had 50 to 75 of these
papers picked up because they might offend the
parents of prospective students. The Publishing
Board fired the R-tP editor Michael Gallagher for
“‘irresponsibility,’’ but the EC reinstated him as
editor. The Publishing Board then suspended the
R-tP, in protest to the reinstatement, until they
reached a decision with the EC. Gallagher finally
resigned saying the pressure was too much.

The 1979 school year had to be highlighted by the
“‘library move.”

All the books needed to be moved from the old
library, 150,000 volumes. As it turned out, 1,600
people including students, faculty, and townspeo-
ple, helped, moving all the books in just two and a
half hours when it was planned to take up to eight
hours.

The whole thing was a great success, and to top
everything off, there was a party in McCormick.

The old library began its $3.5 million, 18-month
renovation to become the new School of Com-
merce, Economics, and Politics.

The Muscular Distrophy Marathon was started
this year by Jay Blumberg, raising $17,000 for
M.D., which was three times more than they ex-

ee pected. The only other memorable event of this

year was the visit of Ralph Nader to W&L, to

speak on corporate power.

The ’70’s ended with a “‘bang,”’ with both the
anti-Iran rally and the Boxwood ‘‘bush hopping”
incident. The anti-Iran rally, sparked by the tak-
ing of fifty American hostages in Iran, involved
approximately 400 students gathered in front of
the Law School, chanting ‘Nuke ’em till they
glow’, ‘It worked in Japan, try it in Iran’, and
“‘Nuke the Ayatollah...’

The students also burned the Kohmeini three
times in effigy, and finally marched through
downtown Lexington, where they had a brief en-

Le Cardinal Offers French Cuisine Spring

by John Wells

Lexington is fortunate to
boast a new resaurant at the
corner of Lee and Nelson. ‘‘Le
Cardinal Restaurant francaise”’
opened its doors two weeks ago
and offers the area a variety of
traditional French dishes in a
pleasant, relaxed atmosphere.

The owners, Francois Blot
and Geoffrey Hoge, have each
acquired years of experience in
their profession, and this is
quite evident in Le Cardinal’s
unique atmosphere, excellent
service and fine, meticulously
prepared foods.

The menu, which changes
from time to time, will feature
regional French cuisine with
two specialties each day. Begin-
ning in the fall, the owners plan
to offer food from Russia,
China, North Africa, Belgium,
Hungary and other countries on
a monthly basis.

The current menu includes a
variety of entrees, legumes and
desserts at relatively moderate
prices.

Dining is an important aspect
of French culture. Most schools
and businesses in that country
close down from noon until 2
p.m. for a relaxed midday
meal. In addition, most produce
in France is sold fresh at open
markets. Good wine and lots of

freshly baked bread is con-
sidered essential.

The owners of Le Cardinal in-
sist on this in America as well.
They receive fresh produce

 

from Roanoke and Charlottes-
ville, and each morning the
baker freshly prepares and
bakes the breads, pastries and
pate en corute.

Every dish at Le Cardinal is
made from scratch, from pate
to the delicious vinagrette in the
Salade Cardinal.

The owners, both French
born, chose Lexington as a loca-
tion for their restaurant from
previous associations with the
city.

Potter Finds Words Of Praise For Ariel

by Parker Potter

Reviewing a literary magazine like Ariel is a tricky business
because it requires a critical assessment of two distinct acts, the
primary act of creation of literary works and the secondary, but no
less creative act, of compilation and ordering of those pieces of
literary creation.

A lapse of either end of things, poor writing or poor editing, can
sink a magazine and poor writing, poorly edited, well—the result of
that combination is too messy to even think about.

And besides — the point of this exposition is the fact that Chris
Fay’s second Ariel is a triumph on both levels. It contains a good bit
of good writing effectively and attractively presented.

(One interesting note is the fact that this time around Fay lists
himself not as an editor but as a member of the collective which in-
cludes Chip McPhetters, John Sadd, Tom Salley and Channing
Hall.

I’m not quite sure how this editorial board operated, but with no
intention of slighting the other members, I am inclined to give Fay
much of the credit for this Ariel if only because he took so much of
the heat for the last one.

Speaking of the last Ariel, I find this one to be light years more
satisfying. Generally I like the individual works better and I also
prefer their presentation this time around.

One of the real bright spots last time, the use of art work, was
taken a step further in this Ariel by the inclusion of brush painting
by Nick Martin, Chris Menefee and Jeff Shumate. Giving new
perspectives on the creative life at W&L is just whatAriel is here to
do.

There are other praiseworthy aspects to Ariel’s construction.
Space is quite well utilized. (There’s a great deal going on in Ariel
— surprisingly much — but it doesn’t look cramped or crowded).

Further, there is a clearly conscious and intelligent arrangement
of the pieces in Ariel.

For example, the first six pieces each deal with the outside world.
Winos, pigeon feeders, Asbury Park. These six disparate examina-

 

photograph by Richard Essex

tions of a very public world work well together.

Then for the next five pieces we are jolted sharply to the very
private vision which so dominated the previous Ariel. In this group-
ing too, we have a number of different perspectives, each strugg]-
ing to show the reader a different, very personal world.

The rest of the magazine doesn’t work for me in quite so formal a
manner but that is no implicit criticism. Generally speaking, the
pace of the rest of the magazine is very good with the possible ex-
ception of the placement of Jim Leva’s two pieces next -to Phil
Welch’s poem.

Not that your basic reader is a simpleton, but a bit of a breather
between these thoughtful and thought provoking pieces might have
been helpful.

Though this Ariel might not have quite the single vi-
sion/wholeness of its predecessor, it is as carefully crafted and any
apparrent conventionality of presentation is achieved with no loss
of artistic integrity.

In all, then, this is a fine editorial effort. But like I said above
—the best editorial job in the world can’t save trash. And in this
case it doesn’t have to. Good writing is what makes this Ariel go.

So onward.

There is all kinds of good stuff going on in these poems which lead
off Ariel.

The opening of Chris Fay’s “Holes ‘N Winos”’ is delightfully ar-
resting, ‘‘Winos like saxophones/on the bandstand/lean/sunning/in
front of a stone/sucking the warmth/out of cigarettes.”’

One is set to accept that the winos get their heat from the sun
which holds them in place like saxophones, but Fay plays upon our
expectations to show the differentness of winos.

A big shiny sun is doing its thing, but winos turn to the smokey
orange glow of a cigarette for their warmth.

And this all works well with the wino dream which closes the
poem. The best that ‘‘big human wings” can fly a wino away to isa
romantically lit boxcar, certainly hobo heaven, but a pretty empty

the home field advantage in the

last two regular season contests

The Generals took a 6-3 lead

About Yesterday's Game

Unforunately, the powerful

you when it comes to games
which are played nine hours
away, a day after our deadline.

But we do know this: the
Generals lost to Syracuse by a
score of 12-4. W&L was even at
the end of the first quarter but
fell behind at the half, 6-2.
Syracuse then ran the score up
to 9-2, and the game was all but
decided at that point.

Mike Pressler scored two
goals for the Generals, while
George Santos and Jay Foster
each netted one.

Chris Kearney scored to
break a 3-3 tie at the 11:56
mark. About a minute later
Geoff Wood netted a goal to put
the Generals up by 2. Co-
Captain John Hooper then
scored early in the fourth period
to put W&L ahead by three
goals with about 14 minutes to
play.

Hofstra took advantage of
that time to mount a scoring
drive of their own which tied the

game 6-6 at the end of regula-
tion play.

That sent the game into over-
time periods of four minutes
each, the game going to the first
team to score.

Play was stalemated for the
first 3 minutes of the first over-
time period. But the Flying Dut-
chmen’s Bob Quinlan scored his
third goal of the game to give
Hofstra the 7-6 victory.

Commentary:

In the 1980 Lax Tournament,
Prepare For the Unexpected

by Bill Whalen

For the gentlemen in charge
of giving out bids to the NCAA
Division I lacrosse tournament,
what a difference a year makes.
Instead of the anger and confu-
sion over last year’s pairings,
the lacrosse community seems
content with this year’s selec-
tions.

And here’s why.

In 1979, the only positions
guaranteed in the tournament
were the top four positions.
Johns Hopkins, Maryland,
Navy and Virginia each had re-
mained firmly embedded in the
top four places throughout the
regular season. But below those
teams existed a mad scramble
for the remaining five spots.

In 1980, there has been a
scramble below the top spots,
leaving six spots up for grab go-
ing into the final few weeks. But
fortunately for the selection
committee, some trends began
to take place in these last
weeks, making the choices all
the simpler.

And here are some examples.

— Syracuse, despite losing (to
be more accurate, being
humiliated) by W&L, did not
lose another game, making the
Orangemen’s position stronger
with each rating.

— Maryland, perennially a
high finisher, lost important
games at home throughout the
season and kicked itself out of
the tournament by losing to
Baltimore.

— The Northern teams
(Rutgers, Army, and
Massachusetts) knocked each
other out by playing a round
robin elimination sort of season.

But of all the teams involved
in this year’s selecting process,
perhaps the Washington and

Lee Generals had the greatest
influence on who would play
whom. By slipping three not-
ches in the polls, the Generals
allowed some teams who would
normally not be invited.

The luckiest team, obviously,
was North Carolina. Had the
Tar Heels lost to W&L two
weeks ago, they would have
been fortunate to get the No. 8
spot. Instead, the Tar Heels are
fifth, facing a showdown with
Dick Szlaza’s Navy team.

But even though the pairings
have received favorable
reviews, not much is different
from last year. Three of last
year’s top four teams were in
this year’s tournament’s top
four, and only three teams in
this year’s playoffs were absent
in 1979. It is interesting to note
that Syracuse and Virginia, two
teams which seemed crippled
by early and embarassing
losses, made the biggest climb
from last year. The Wahoos
were fourth last year and first
this year, while Syracuse was
seventh last year, but third this
year,

Because this was written
before the playoffs began, I
shall refrain from picking any
team to win it all. I will,
however, note who has an easy
road and who does not.

At No. 8, Cornell seems to
have benefited more from its
reputation than anything else in
making the magic eight. If the
Red Men beat Virginia, they
will then visit either UNC or
Navy. One road win in the tour-
nament is amazing, two are
almost unheard of.

At No. 7, Harvard made the
grade by unanimously staying
high in the polls each week. The
Crimson Tide will earn upset of
the year awards if they beat

players had a good game.

Goalie Bob Clements made an
astounding 31 saves as the
Generals were outshot 58-39.
Rob Staugitis came up with two
assists, boosting his season
total to 37.

W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer commented about the
General’s final regular season
game, ‘‘Hofstra just never gave
up...they were a_ relentless
group and managed to turn it
around.”

Hopkins — but don’t count on it.

At No. -§ UNC it «4
schizophrenic’s delight, either
winning or losing in a grandiose
fashion. The Tar Heels’ for-
tunes depends on whether the
Dr. Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde team
plays.

At No. 4, Navy has had the
luck to lose most of its games
early in the season. The Middies
can bury a team (as they did
against Maryland), or be buried
(as they were against Hopkins).

At No. 3, Syracuse could be
the hottest team in the nation.
Despite an incredibly tough
schedule, including three
playoff teams, the Orangemen
have lost once.

At No. 2, Johns Hopkins has
also lost only once, with that
loss also coming at the hands of

a Virginia-based team. Since
the loss to UVA, Hopkins has
been unstoppable — most
noticeablly against Navy and
Maryland.

At No. 1, Virginia is com-
peting against two tough op-
ponents — injury and nerves.
The Cavs need a healthy Steve
Kraus and Bato Pellington, as
well as nerves of steel to withs-
tand the pressures of being the
top team,

And what of W&L?

Well, the Generals need ot-
fense, and tons of it, to go all the
way. If W&L gives the same
performances it did against
Rutgers and Syracuse, then
look out. But if the Generals
continue to score only seven
goals a game, then the season

will be over before you know it.

So in the meantime, enjoy this
tournament. In one of the most
unpredictable years of lacrosse,
the winner of the tournament
may also be a longshot.

He asked EC members to
take note that the uneven spend-
ing of funds for the year re-
sulted because the club usually
operates only during the cold
months of the year.

Fencing Club spokesman Colt
Puryear reported that of the
seven matches held this past
season, the club won three and
lost four.

The team finished top among
fencing clubs in the state,
managing to do so in spite of
graduating two of last year’s
starters.

Puryear noted that the team
managed quite well even
though it received only one-
tenth of the $2,500 it requested
from the EC, which was one-
fifth of what the club had
received from the EC last year.

Puryear said that funds
generated by the club covered
expenses for the year and left
an ending balance of $35.62.

Cold Check Chairman Jim
Vines presented the financial
report to the EC noting that the
figure with which they started
the academic year was almost
exactly the same as the $1,152
figure in their present, end-of-
year account.

Vines said, ‘‘This is due to the
pretty good improvement over
last year in the number of
bounced checks.”

“We started the year with a
good position and we ended up
in a good position,” he told the
EC.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg said that School
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley re-
quested in a letter to the Univer-
sity that transcripts be held on
cold checks.

past, on beer for those people in-

over 100 cases of yearbooks to
the CALYX office.

The EC granted his request
with a 7-1 vote and one absten-
tion.

Hamilton told the EC “as
soon as the yearbooks arrive we
will start handing them out.”

Parker Roberts, co-editor of
next year’s CALYX, told the EC
that Mock Convention related
material would appear in the
CALYX, byt pictures of the con-
vention itself would not appear
in the yearbook until next year.

He indicated that inclusion of
the Mock Convention pictures
could have held up completion
of the yearbook until late in the

completed his second year at

in its recent decision to take
away the salaries of editors and
business managers.

‘‘The Pub Board objects to be-

than being worked with,” said
Potter.

In rebuttal, Blumberg said
that he felt there was little stu-

ion of salaries for some editors

on the Pub Board, and that
‘nothing has stopped the

No more than ten universities

Dan Weeks provides this Ariel with another of his thoughtful str-
ings of images, called ‘‘Asbury Park in Mid-September.’’ Of par-
ticular interest is his linkage of a scuffling leaf peircing
nothingness and ‘‘a man hurtling into silence.”

Here he shows that it is the observer and the observer only who'
can bring together the teenaged slut and the burst of rock ’n roll to!
people and furnish the implicit vacuum of the city.

(Just as an aside, my favorite line in the whole volume is ‘‘The
custard is gone”’ from Weeks’ poem).

Phil Welch’s poem ‘‘Maxie”’ is a faScinating study of motion. The
idea of winds being cornered and dying and the idea of wind not be-
ing able to escape makes one wonder if the last brief whirl of the
bread crumbs isn’t indeed a beginning and not an end.

For me, the end of this poem is a beginning and serves as an ex-
cellent jumping off point for Jim Leva’s long poem.

For Leva it is not bread crumbs but blood and he details the cycle
of degeneration and regeneration, the cycle of life hinted at in
Welsh’s poem.

Leva’s is an artful construct which finally realizes itself as artful.
‘But really, what's the big deal now?’’ Suddenly Leva jumps from
the ‘‘artistic vision,’ what the poet can create of symbols and im-
ages,

‘the cold blood that made Bokassa fat for la gloire

de la France (like the gore of France

that painted the Pont d’ Arole

or christened the rues bourgeois Paris )

From this he jumps to a “real vision’’ of what an over ‘‘prac-
tical’ man makes of the ideas around him:

Perhaps as in Belgium, poppies will grow.

They'll be more useful now. There

they're a traditional crop. I believe,

a common cash crop, at least in neighboring Laos.”’

Which vision do you think is Leva’s?

Like his poem, Leva’s story ‘‘Izaak,”’ deals in contrasts. His
great skill here is dealing in modern idiom with characters and
issues to seemingly medevial.

What Izaak’s mother and her prodigious buboes clearly beg for is
a Guiness Book of Records reporter and a camera crew from the
Six o'clock news.

As always — one is impelled through Leva’'s story by his unique
vision of the language and the freedom it allows him,

And in terms of freedom allowed by language, the more I read by

amination of a man’s position vis ’a vis other men and the con-
structs we all must make.

Katherine Reich is back with two very personal, probing poems.
And Phil Welch provides a major poetic work ‘‘Saigyo” which I’ve
simply not had time to consider.

In all, Fay’s second Ariel is a triumph and if anyone was looking
for such a thing, a vindication. This Ariel contains a wide variety of
styles and genres yet retains a style and certainly hangs well
together.

With this Ariel I think that Fay has found the broad audience that
is out there without any artistic sacrifice. A tribute to that is the
fact that there are so many stones I’ve left unturned in this review.

The solution to that minor problem? Easy — read Ariel.

Emmons; 20 Years At Washington & Lee

' (continued from page 1)

member has said. ‘The quality of life here is much
healthier — less frenetic and more civilized!’ ’’

Following his graduation from Trinity in 1950,
Emmons taught biology and mathematics at
Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va. for
seven years. He says that he hasn't ‘‘kept up well
enough”’ with Episcopal to comment on changes in
that school during the last three decades, but notes
that “‘it’s entirely different — I don’t recognize it
any more.”

The events which ultimately brought Emmons
to Washington and Lee began, oddly enough, with
the Russians’ launching of Sputnik in 1954.
America’s science community was sufficiently
shocked by this display of Soviet technology that
they hastily established the National Science
Foundation, its primary aim being to compete
with the Russians.

Among the foundation’s programs was the crea-
tion of university “‘institutes’’ which ‘‘gave secon-
dary school teachers a chance to catch up on
scientific development.”

It was under one of these one-year grants that
Emmons first came to the University of Virginia
in 1957. Since it was only a one-year program, Em-
mons says, “I really went hog wild! I took full ad-
vantage of it, really worked myself to my limit...
and when that year was over, I was awarded other
grants to continue.”’ He adds, magnanimously but
sincerely, ‘‘I owe all my success to NFS.”’

Emmons considers graduate school to be a
highly gratifying experience because ‘‘there can
be total involvement in a particular area. It’s ex-
citing...plus, you’re older. I was more highly
motivated than as an undergraduate.”’

During his final graduate year, Emmons came
to W&L exploring job opportunities. ‘‘Arriving at
W&L in 1960,’’ he says, “‘was like coming to UVa,”
for at that time the two schools were still very
similar, especially on the undergraduate level.
“The old guard traditions were still in vogue...coat
and tie, the conversational tradition, the friendly
atmosphere.”’

  
   

Within a decade, most of these traditions had
ended. The University of Virginia had even begun
to admit women as undergraduates. While Em-
mons, with his gray beard and casual manner,
hardly seems tradition-bound, he maintains that
some of the time-honored forms had their value.

‘When I came to W&L,”’ he says, “everyone
spoke to everyone — faculty and students alike. If
you had to cross campus for something, you'd
never try it between classes...you’d end up talking
to everyone!”’ This conversational tradition ended
with that of the coat and tie, as the late sixties and
Vietnam brought a temper to the university.

“Everyone was doing his own thing,’’ Emmons
recalls. ‘‘It was the age of relevance.’’ Even at
historically conservative Washington and Lee, a
‘Free University’’ was established. ‘‘People were
growing potatoes, composting, raising bees.”’
Non-credit classes in these disciplines ‘‘were held
in various rooms around town, with as many as
twenty to thirty people sitting in on them.”

On campus, also, changes were being made to
accommodate changing times. In May, 1970, for
example, the faculty permitted students to elect to
receive an ‘incomplete’ in any or all second
semester courses in order to “participate more
freely in national issues.’’ The work was to be
made up by September 30 or recorded as an F.

At the end of the semester, 397 students had
taken 889 I’s. Most courses were ultimately made
up. 150 ended up as F’s.

Longer-lasting trends began also. A new cur-
riculum was introduced, changing distribution re-
quirements and contributing to a decrease in the
number of students involved in certain disciplines.

More students became involved in ‘“‘relevant’”’
courses like economics, history and the sciences,
and less in some of the traditional liberal arts
courses. Business Administration, for example,
was twice as popular a major in 1970 as it had been
five years earlier.

Emmons refers to the current academic.scene
as one of “‘new relevance — now, with a depressed
economy, the business school is the largest’’ at
W&L. ‘“‘When you get out of college, you’re going
to have to know something, to have a salable com-
modity.”’

He also notes that in the Commerce school,
“demands are tough. If the other departments
made the same demands, they wouldn’t have
students.”’ This problem and that of grade escala-
tion can be traced directly back to the new cur-
riculum, says Emmons. ‘There was grade escala-
tion in order to attract students. If you didn’t have
‘relevant’ courses, you couldn’t attract students
otherwise.”’

For evidence of grade escalation, Emmons sug-
gests taking a look at the Reports of the Registrar
for various years. From these, some trends can be
easily detected.

The fall term Dean’s List in 1967 included 237
people; in the fall of 1975, that number was up to
492. Last year’s list carried 454 names.

Similarly, the number of students graduating
with honors increased from 42 in 1965 to 121 in 1975,
with 14 attaining summa cum laude status in 1975
as compared with one ten years earlier. Last year,
106 people graduated with honors. —

The percentage of A’s given in courses has in-
creased from slightly over 11 percent in 1960 to
over 23 percent in 1979. In the same period, C’s
have decreased from almost 40 percent of grades
given in 1960 to about 25.5 percent, with B’s hang-
ing steady at about 35 percent.

Emmons deplores the high incidence of grade
escalation at W&L and other universities, as well
as the “how little do I need to do, just to get
through”’ attitude of many of today’s students. He
feels a “how much can I do to satisfy my needs”
attitude would be desirable, but admits that
widespread adoption of such an attitude would be
highly unlikely.

‘The way the system stands now, there’s really
a self-perpetuating problem. If you do make
demands and expect your students to do things
and find they don’t, there’s not much you can do.
We (professors ) are aware of your failure to do the
minimum amount of work. If you make an assign-
ment, you don’t expect the student to do it,’ Em-
mons says.

‘The problem of permissiveness,” he continues,
‘‘is started at home, and generated in the secon-
dary schools. We are teaching students who have-
not been disciplined.’ As a result, ‘‘students
categorically are not as well prepared, nor as in-
volved or diligent,’’ as they were in the early six-
ties when ‘‘students requested seminars, extra
reading and discussions, for no credit.”’

Only partially tongue-in-cheek, Emmons also
notes that Wednesday night parties were not in ex-
istence then, being yet another innovation of the
late sixties. Prior to that, he explains, ‘‘there were
party weekends — four a year — when there were
real bashes with lots of preparation. They were
very successful.”

Emmons finds some consolation in W&L’s low
student-faculty ratio and its selective admissions
standards. ‘‘We’re very selective,” he says, “‘yet
we still get students who meet our prerequisites
and can’t read or write.’’ He adds that most can do
math and have some proficiency in the natural
sciences. This, too, he credits to Sputnik.

When he isn’t musing over the problems of the
current academic system, trying to correct them,
traveling to far-flung places to pursue his re-
search, or giving interviews, Emmons likes to
take pictures, fly, soar, hike, camp and brew beer
at home with his family.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Salaries

The door to meddling in the daily operations of the
university’s publications has been left wide open by a
recent EC decision regarding the salaries of editors
and business managers of Ariel, The CALYX and the
Ring-tum Phi.

The writer is opposed to salaries, but is even more
opposed to the manner in which the EC abolished
salaries.

There seems to be two problems with the EC’s deci-
sion, which is pregnant with dangerous possibilities.

First the EC appears to have violated its constitu-
tion in handing down its verdict on salaries.

Two sections of the constitution could be used here,
but the latter of the two sections is more applicable
than the first.

Section V of the Constitution is found on page 18 of
the Student Handbook.

Section A. states, ‘‘The Executive Committee shall
have legislative, executive and judicial powers in all
matters pertaining to the Student Body Organiza-
tion.”

However, Section G. says, ‘‘It shall have appellate
jurisdiction of the Publication Board and may after
notice and hearing and upon two-thirds vote of the en-
tire Committee at two successive meetings, reverse
any order of the Board.’

Salaries are an order of the Publications Board, but
the EC did not give notice and did not achieve a two-
thirds majority of the entire committee.

While the abolition of salaries is a good idea, it is an
end that would be best achieved if so done within the
framework of the Student Body Constitution.

Does this decision by the EC mean that every time
it does not like a publication or a Publications Board
decision it will hand down an arbitrary ruling?

We hope not—that would certainly have a bearing
on the editorial policy of the Phi and detract from the
overall quality of the University’s publications.

A second question which arises is why did this
year’s EC and not next year’s EC act on this matter?

EC President-elect Bob Willis has gone on record as
being opposed to salaries but voted in favor of
salaries two weeks ago because he opposed the pre-
sent EC acting on this matter.

Obviously the problem is a difficult one for the EC.
It has legislative, executive and judicial powers, a
combination most likely to be found in the Soviet
Union.

But this is not the Soviet Union, it is not even the
real world.

Yet we hope that next year’s EC will see that the EC
has made an error (we all do) and move to correct a
potentially dangerous situation.

We don’t think the EC should or even wants to
monitor and dictate the University’s publications
standards and practices, a situation which could arise
because of the EC’s decision on the salary question.

Dear Editor:

I have just a few comments
about the EC’s May 12 decision
to abolish the Publication
Board’s salaries and its affir-
mation of that decision Monday
night.

At stake here is not the ques-
tion of salaries but rather the
propriety of a governmental
body, the EC making decisions
about actions of the press (the
Publications Board).

Dictating to the Publications
Board how to spend its money is
not far from telling the Ring-
tum Phi what to print.

(You can spend only $400 this
week. That is eight pages. So
bag this, this, and this story and
run that one. )

The rub is that the EC, for the
student body, allocates money
to the Phi and therefore has a
responsibility to oversee the
spending of that money.

And so we have a justifiable
green-backed link between
the press
(government superior, of
course).

The real world, though, has a
first amendment, freedom of
speech, etc. But then, Congress
does not fund the Washington
Post.

Things are tricky, admitted-
ly. But what we need here is
trust. The EC must trust the
Publications Board exclusively
to deal with its money matters
as well as with its editorial mat-

ters, if only because every

fiscal decision is a_ little
editorial and every editorial

matter is a little fiscal.

The Publications Board
recognizes the right and the
responsibility of the EC to ex-
press student opinion and to
protect the best interests of the
student body.

But we feel that that respon-
sibility is adequately discharg-
ed by getting issues, salaries
among them, on the record in
open EC meetings. Monthly
reports are an excellent step in
this direction.

These comments are inspired by a recent editorial about Univer-
sity Council elections. In that editorial the point is made that
W&L is the one place where students and faculty administration
can come together to talk about issues like Wednesday night par-
ties and weeknight Cockpit bands.

We’ve been round and round about these two issues before but
there are a couple of points that need to be made.

First, if a fellow wants to blow off on a Wednesday night, he’ll
blow it off, party or no party. Perhaps without Wednesday night
parties per se that fellow and his friends would spread their
slackness around and blow off different nights each week, thus
making whatever problem exists far less easy to detect, probably
satisfying those shortsighted few who equate Wednesday parties
with any and all academic ills at W&L.

sul whatever the academic problems — a party ban won't solve
it.

This isn’t to suggest that there aren’t problems with Wednesday
parties. But the degree to which a weeknight party is a problem is
the degree to which a fraternity member (particularly a
freshman...) feels obligated to attend it, because it is paid for by
regular social dues.

As long as week night parties are pay-as-you-go affairs (as many
are now) attendance and non-attendance become equally viable
choices. And so long as it is as easy not to go as it is to go, there is no
problem.

Banning Wednesday parties is just a short step away from telling
people that they can’t watch “Charlie's Angels” on a school night.

A large part of college is learning to be adult and a large part of
being an adult is dealing with choices. The right of the individual to

choose what he wants to do shouldn't be legislated away.

Further, I don’t think that there's any pressing need to legislate
away that right to choose. When other matters have pressed I've
Kinniburgh Replies

Dear Editor:

I confess that through the
course of 22 articles I have writ-
ten for the Ring-tum Phi, I pur-
posely misinformed my fans not
once, but on many occasions.
For example, throughout the
course of the year, I have
misspelled Gary Numan as
“Gary Norman’, ‘Gary Non-
man’’, “Gary Neuman’’ and
“Gray Numon.”’ I apologize
sincerely to Mr. Numan and
Atlantic Records, but I just
couldn’t decide on the correct
spelling or for that matter, any

spelling. I can’t blame such a _

series of errors on the first
typist or typesetter, because
that would be silly.

Also, I have’ purposely
mislead one-half of my public in
that I routinely quote Billboard,
Walrus, and College Media
Journal, especially the charts
that deal with new album
movers and retail action, and I
don’t specify which new album
chart I am using. Of course, my
original intentions in each case
is to dupe the public into believ-
ing that Pink Floyd has not held
the number one spot on
Billboard’s Hot 100 Album
Chart (Based on Retail Sales)
for the last 20 weeks. I really
shouldn’t give that credit to
Elvis Costello because he has
held the top spot on _ the
Billboard New Album Action
Chart (Based on Radio Play).
Again, my attention to specifici-
ty is lacking.

Finally, I have polluted the
print of the Ring-tum Phi by us-
ing images that a 4th grader
could have figured out. The use

of words such as ‘‘semi,’’ and
“Styx” I will readily agree is a
bit stupid and take much in-
tellect to correctly put together.
I really should refrain from any
use of a word that is not 1) a pro-
per noun 2) a verb or 3) a con-
junction, as this will preclude
any irresponsible imagery that
might offend a RTP reader. To
close my apology — I will ask
for each reader’s forgiveness
and if possible make restitution
for all damages incurred by
reading my articles. Be assured
also that I am recalling all ar-
ticles that I have written for
Paradise Records’ in
Hollywood, CA, Atlantic
Records of New York, RSO
Records of Los Angeles, RCA
Records (Division of Video
Research), Warner Brothers
Records and 415 Records of Los
Angeles and San Francisco,
Sire Records and many, many
others. But funny, they never
complained or refused to print
any of my lies.

Outing Club Proposal

Rockclimbing And Canoeing

(continued from page 8)

The recent survey of the
freshman class indicates that
students are overwhelmingly in
favor of the establishment of an
Outing program which would
provide such activities as
rockclimbing, backpacking and
canoeing. The proposal sug-
gests that a commensurate
percentage of upperclassmen
may be interested in such a pro-
gram as well.

The proposal does not sug-
gest, however, that this Outing
program would be offered in
competition with fraternity ac-
tivities, but rather, as a comple-
ment. Noting that the frater-
nities used to provide their
members with an adequate
range of extra-curricular ac-
tivities, the proposal states that
they no longer fulfill this func-
tion satisfactorily. Through an
outing program, both indepen-
dent and fraternity ,»member
alike would be given the oppor-
tunity to broaden thefnselves.

The proposal further states

that other colleges, such as
Dartmouth, Williams and the
University of Wisconsin, have
successfully implemented pro-
grams of their own and found
them useful in attracting and
developing a well-rounded stu-
dent body. Washington and Lee
could, conceivably, adopt from
these existing programs the
blueprint for its program. This
task should not be difficult,
since the University is sur-
rounded by mountains, rivers
and forests of which it presently
makes minimal use.

The organizational structure
detailed in the proposal calls for
the establishment of various
clubs—canoeing, hiking, etc.,
all of which would be under the
auspices of an executive board
headed by a Program Director.

Each club, in turn, would
have its own president, vice
president and_ secretary-
treasurer. The president of
each club would serve on the ex-
ecutive board, meeting regular-
ly with the Program Director.

Singleton

At a special ceremony held
April 19th in the Marshall
Library in Lexington, Virginia,
Major James W. Singleton,
Assistant Professor of Military
Science at Washington and Lee
University, was decorated with
the Army Commendation
Medal.

This was the 4th award of the

The University Council Elections

chosen not to attend Wednesday parties and even weekend parties.
And I’m not exceptional in this respect. Hardly.

We have few enough choices as it is once we hit Big Lex. I’m not
knocking Lexington but it is a fact that there’s not a great deal to do
in town or near by.

But all colleges aren’t located in the idyllic Shenandoah valley, as
cut off as we are from so much. Some of the greatest universities
this country are located in great cities like New York, Chicago,
Boston, and Philadelphia which boast a whole lot more distractions
than weeknight bands in the Cockpit.

If the people who want to ban weeknight bands in the Cockpit
were at an urban college they’d be digging moats, buying elec-
trified barbed wire and happily drawing straws for bed check duty.

No, banning bands isn’t the answer. Outlawing weeknight parties
is like putting make-up over measles and calling it a cure. You take
away a guy’s party and you've done nothing about his opinion that
partying is more important than booking.

(And hey — who knows — just maybe this fellow bagged his
Wednesday afternoon tennis game to spend the time doing Wednes-
day night’s work ahead of time...stranger things have happened. )

Like I was saying — the band banners are attacking symptoms
without addressing causes. If the real problem here is academics
(and that is the only legitimate problem) the solution should be
sought in the classroom.

If the problem is poor student performance, there is a solution to
that. Poor students get poor grades. And habitual poor grades have
a whole string of weighty consequences.

But if a student can come to class hung over once or twice a week
and still do well enough on papers and tests to get a good grade,
that’s the professor’s problem, not the student’s. (In “real life’’ an
obligation met is an obligation met, )

And a professor has a real problem when he starts juggling
course requirements to dictate student behavior. (Yes, I’m talking

ber

about Thursday morning quizzes and Wednesday before
Thanksgiving tests. )

If the function of a course requirement has more to do with polic-
ing student behavior than it does to the material of the course, then
it is nothing more than an elaborate game.

Due dates on course work should be determined by the content of
the course, not the social schedule of the student body.

The point here is choice. It seems to me that good academic work
is far more valuable, far richer when it is done by choice rather
than because there’s nothing else to do.

And the job of the teacher in the scheme of things? That’s easy.
The good teacher doesn’t_ban bands or threaten students away
from parties. He simply presents what he’s selling as a more
desirable way to spend an evening than getting drowned in stale
beer and staler tunes.

And really, that shouldn’t be all that difficult, People have been
reading Shakespeare for close to 400 years. I doubt that the Drifters
will prove to have such staying power.

Response To * Convention Thoughts”

by M. Gray Coleman

Well, here it is — the next-to-last issue of our venerable Phi, and
the ex-ed has managed to keep his trap shut all year. But after last
week’s bit of contemplation by my ole’ comrade in arms, P. Potter,
I figure one last gasp of exasperation by a voluntary five-year man
deserves another. In short, Parker, if you want someone to play
John to your Shana (or vice versa), never fear, because here |
come.

For those with short memories, a brief review of where we stand.
Last week, we saw a column, ironically entitled ‘‘Thoughts on the
Mock Convention.”’ A neatly-boxed item in two-column-wide type,
the piece refers to the platform session as a ‘‘90 proof farce,” con-
tinually — and with some personal asperity — argues against the
rigidly enforced necktie code, and all but accuses the Steering
Committee of making the decision to nominate Reagan all by
themselves, in smoke-filled splendor, in the 5th floor gym
classroom or some other exotic locale...It’s hard to decide where to
start when responding, there’s so many goose feathers flying
around.

Let’s start, just for fun, with the platform session complaints. In
some areas, I agree with Parker: it was too loud for some to hear
the debate. And for anyone to say that there wasn’t alcohol floating
around seems to me to be the quintessence of wishful thinking.

But I fail to see how you can hold the organizers of the event
‘directly responsible.”

First, I do not believe that people remain in places where they
are unable to follow the course of events. And I saw several hun-
dred students with platform booklets open — following the session
attentively. A quick look at Cable Nine’s videotape bears this out.
Parker should take a gander at it — it’s free. I would like to suggest
that the bulk of the noise Parker complains about was caused by
the mass exodus of alumni leaving Warner Center after the
speeches to attend their own booze-it-up affair with Lester Lanin.
In fact, many students are up in arms over what they perceive as
unforgivable rudeness on the part of hundreds of alums — guests,
not sponsors of the Convention, I might remind readers — many of
whom had to be asked to leave due to enormous noise in the spec-
tators’ areas and in the rear of the delegates’ seats. Others formed
a mini-mob for the purpose of getting autographs or a chat with an
understandably bewildered Barry Goldwater.

I am not saying that many students didn’t let the spirits fly (in all
senses of the word), but the blame is not to be found there. And for
alumni complaints, may I suggest you leave the Steering Commit-
tee out of it, and confer instead with the alumni association hon-
chos. (Indeed, it is my feeling that realizing they are no longer
bound by the rules of Student Control has left a large number of our
alumni a bit giddy...)

Last week’s editorialist also admits that his understanding of the
1976 convention was “‘incomplete.’’ How true, how true...Attentive
observers of the last convention and this one actually found the
platform debate to be the most active, intelligent — yes, even
stimulating — that they had seen in some time. Surprise! Approx-
imately 75-80% of the delegates remained in their seats for the en-
tire platform debate, casting votes as their own consciences guid-
ed. Again Cable Nine has the proof on film. More students spoke at
the podium than ever before — around fifty on platform night
alone. And if it was loud, I chalk it up to honest enthusiasm, not
merely to liquor. Most of our students share a Republican/conser-
vative outlook, and if they got loud or heated, I honestly believe that
it was because they felt there was a personal stake for each of them
in what was going to be touted as the platform of ‘‘The Student
Body.”’

Contrast that response with 1976, when the platform was more
liberal, Democratic—and, by the end of the session, only some
three hundred remained on the floor. You'd have loved it, Parker —
it was really quiet then — but I don’t think as many thoughtful
students came out feeling they’d learned something. And, no — it
wasn’t as much fun,

Now I probably shouldn’t get into the subject of ‘‘fun,’’ because
that’s what really makes the Mock Convention a ‘‘shameful fraud”’
in Parker’s view. Such elevated phrases ought to have a little fac-
tual material behind them, n’est-ce pas? Regretfully, they don’t.

I cannot believe that Parker has ever witnessed a single instant
of any real political convention in person or on the tube. If so, he
would have realized how the Mock Convention fails to mirror the
genuine article. And these are the only ways. If it were the real
thing, and say you were a delegate, chances are you wouldn’t have
heard anything from the podium at all...Any chance for pre-
convention involvement or getting in on the organizational side
would be near to impossible. (You'd be surprised how many people
took that ‘‘90 proof’ platform seriously at the open hearings in Lee
Chapel — that is, if you’d attended.) And, at the risk of being flip-
pant, let me suggest that delegates sneaking booze into real con-
ventions is probably the rule.

I really loved the nonsense last week about Rule 16-B. Dispensing
with this procedural rule for the vice-presidential nominating pro-
cess is quite acceptable — and could only be seen as a devious trick
by someone looking pretty hard (and not too accurately) to find
fault with the process.

And now, to the matter of student participation. It is agonizingly
true that the average delegate has very little input into the
presidential balloting. But do you honestly believe that the legally-
bound delegates in Detroit this summer will have any more say-so?
And, although the Steering Committee probably appreciates the
compliment, it would be unfair to suggest that the 18 members of
that group made all the plans, did all the research, etc.

It would be impossible to calculate how many hundreds—yes,
hundreds—of state chairmen, research coordinators, facilities peo-
ple, Journal writers, float coordinators, fund-raisers and platform
speakers all together joined forces to pull out the victory that was
the Mock Convention. And anybody who was interested in the
political decision-making angle of it was always welcome to climb
one short flight of stairs to the MC office and offer a little help in
place of after-the-fact criticism of verbal sniping.

Readers may remember that two things Parker did not accuse
the committee of were fiscal irresponsibility or unfair appoint-
ments to committees. And these two evils...There were none, in
fact, and I can think of no better proof than his omission of said
topics. Because if there had been — sweet Jesus, how we would
have heard about it in his column!

In short, Parker seems most disgruntled by the fact that there
isn’t more political uncertainty, that the shots are often called by
the regional coordinators and their political researchers, that a
state chairman cannot cast all his presidential votes for the
manager of the A.B.C. store. Well, that’s just how it is in the real
world, and that’s all that the Mock Convention has ever attempted
to mirror. If he still has complaints, let him take them to the Com-
mittee on Procedure this summer in Detroit.

But to lay such abuse upon a committee that has conscientiously
tried to reflect the American political process is simply un-
forgivable. Although I have usually had the greatest respect for the
logic and organization behind Parker Potter’s judgments (and will
continue to do so), I am equally certain that I’m not the only one

blushing for him over his awesome lack of understanding on this
one.
