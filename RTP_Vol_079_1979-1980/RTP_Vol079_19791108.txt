More than 1,000 parents and guests are
expected to attend Washington and Lee
University’s 25th annual Parents’
Weekend, Friday through Sunday (Nov.
9-11).

The three-day event offers parents an
opportunity to meet W&L faculty
members, attend classes, tour the cam-
pus, view departmental displays and
witness several sporting events. Of par-

will be Washington and Lee’s new
undergraduate library, opened in
January 1979 and in its first full year of
round-the-clock operation.

Also scheduled for the parents are a
number of social events and other in-
formal activities, many staged by W&L’s
16 national fraternities.

Among the highlights of the weekend is
a public concert scheduled for 8:15 p.m.

Sponsored by the W&L music depart-
ment, it features the student Brass and
Percussion Ensembles, under the direc-
tion of Dr.. Robert Stewart, and the
Washington and Lee Glee Club, led by
Dr. Gordon Spice.
Parents and guests have also been in-
vited to attend a reception given by
University President Robert E. R.
Huntley and Mrs. Huntley in Evans Din-

‘25th Annual Parents Weekend Begins Tomorrow

On Saturday at 11:30a.m., Huntley will

matches — the annual alumni-varsity

The Student Activities Board
reported a $3,500 loss from Sun-
day’s Stillwater concert during
Monday’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

The loss was blamed on lack
of attendance and a conflict
with other parties also held on
the weekend.

“The weather was beautiful.
The bands were good, but the
attendance was horrible,”’ said
SAB co-chairman David Har-
pole. ‘‘We knew about Hollins
(Civic Center party) but didn’t
know about Janice being book-
ed,” he added.

In other SAB business, co-
chairman Bill Ridge reported
that Dave Meyers, SAB
member at large, would have to
resign due to fraternity,
academic and Muscular
Dystrophy conflicts.

The Contact Committee
report given by Channing Hall
revealed that no speakers to
date had been booked for the
Fall. Hall said that within the
next three weeks their speaker
agenda should be finalized.

“I’m a little disappointed we
didn’t get one (speaker) for the
Fall,’’ said senior EC Rep. Jay
Blumberg. EC President Steve
Abraham said he wished to echo
Jay’s sentiments and added he
wanted a ‘‘more cohesive set-
up” in their next report for their

winter program speaker line-
up.

That program, said Hall, will
be a “concentrated speaker
line-up in January = and
February.’ The reason, said
Hall, was ‘‘so students will have
an active interest and to show
some continuity.”’

Calyx treasurer John
Hamilton said that ‘‘things are
going pretty well,’’ for the year-
book. He added _ that
underclassmen pictures total
690 and senior photos stand at
180 with 120 scheduled.

‘The patron response is going
over very well,’’ said Hamilton,
adding that they might go over
projected figures. Currently
they have received about 100
replies. He added that the

IFC Fines Beta For Hazing

by Charles Tucker

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council Tuesday
night fined Beta Theta Pi $150
and placed the fraternity on one
year conduct probation for haz-
ing pledges.

The probation stipulates that
a second hazing offense by Beta
will result in a two-week social
probation for the fraternity.

The board levied the penalties
as a result of a fraternity func-
tion last Thursday in which
Beta pledges were’ reportedly

each required to bring two six-
packs of beer to the fraternity
house for consdmption by
pledges and actives after din-
ner.

IFC President Syd Farrar
said the board’s decision was
based on findings that all the
pledges were required to be at
the activity and were required
to drink the beer, and that some
of the pledges got sick as a
result of the drinking.

The activities constitute haz-
ing, said Farrar, and as such

are forbidden by the IFC.

In defense, Beta President
Dickie Finney argued that the
drinking was not restricted to
pledges, but was a house func-
tion which active members
were required to attend as well.

“It was not meant to offend
anybody, there was no physical
abuse,’’ Finney said. “It was

supposed to be fun.”
“It was a _ relaxed at-
mosphere.”’
Finney added that he did not

The Married Life At W&L

Goldwater
To Deliver

Keynote
Address

The 1980 Washington and Lee
University Mock Convention
Committee announced today
that Sen. Barry M. Goldwater,
R-Ariz. four-term Senate
veteran and patriarch of the
Republican party, will deliver
the keynote address at the con-
vention next May 9-10.

The announcement was made
by convention co-chairmen
Craig Cornett, Dick Schoenfeld
and Sidney Simmons.

Washington and Lee’s name
is nothing new to Goldwater—it
goes back to 1964, when the 13th
Mock Convention correctly
predicted that the Senator from
Arizona would be selected as
the Republican nominee for the
presidency. He was personally
on hand in 1968 as part of a Con-
tact symposium on the future of
the Republican party, and he
visited again in 1977 for an ad-
dress sponsored by the W&L
College Republicans.

First elected to the Senate
from the Grand Canyon State in
1952, Goldwater’s bid for the
Oval Office came at a time of
popular sympathy for the
Democratic party and the
challenge of upsetting a power-
ful incumbent in Lyndon
Johnson. As a result, he suf-
fered what was then the worst
margin of defeat in presidential
election history—16 million
votes. Still, his Arizona con-
stitutency sent him back to the
Senate with enthusiasm in 1968,
and in that office he has remain-

It’s a life of frequent frustration, of dif-
ficulty, of isolation, and yet, in the words
of Penny Norfleet, although, ‘‘it’s not a
bed of roses, it’s not all thorns, either.”’
It’s the life of married undergraduate
students at Washington and Lee.

There are currently nine
undergraduate couples at W&L, a
number greater than most students
would probably guess. They are not a
particularly visible group, their married
status tending to set them somewhat
apart from the mainstream, which they
occasionally seem to resent slightly. In
general, though, they are satisfied with
the decision they made, a decision unor-
thodox in this college community.

Sam and Debbie Perkins are a good ex-
ample of this feeling. “Home town
Honeys,”’ in Debbie’s words, they came
from the same Michigan high school.
They married after Sam’s freshman
year here, Debbie leaving her college to
do so, although now, as Sam works
toward law school acceptance, Debbie is
studying nursing at Stonewall Jackson
Hospital.

‘‘Marriage doesn’t make you feel more
mature, really, but it gives you more
responsibility,’ says Sam, an observa-
tion echoed by others of the married
students. In Sam’s and Debbie’s case, the
responsibility is compounded by their
daughter Elizabeth, who will be two in

ed the prominent figure within
the Grand Old Party.

As the Mock Convention
keynoter, Goldwater joina a
distinguished list that includes
Sen. (and former Vice Presi-
dent) Allen Barkley, then-Gov.
Jimmy Carter, Harry S,
Truman and the 1976 speaker,
Sen. William Proxmire. Tradi-
tionally, the keynote speaker is
a prominent leader of the party
out of executive power. His
speech is designed to spark the
crowd of delegates, press and
gallery observers with a spirit
of convention exhilaration and
political pride.

Dirty Words

A British novelist is claiming
a new world record that is even
more usual than most of the
items to be found in the Guin-
ness Book of World Records.

The author claims that her
racy new novel, ‘Lovers and
Gamblers,’’ uses a_ certain
familiar four-letter word 718
times in 503 pages of text. She
also says the word is not an
obscenity ; the novel is about the
rock music scene and ‘“‘in that
millieu, it’s polite conversa-
tion.”’

 

The News In Brief

Big Daddy

Deposed Ugandan dictator
and “president for life” Idi
Amin may have lost his country
and may have a bounty on his
head, but he’s still up to his
same old outrageous tricks.

He admitted killing former
political enemies and other
citizens in torture chambers at
his palace during his reign in an
interview last week with a
French reporter in Libya.

Amin also said that the only
way to achieve world peace is to
make low-priced nuclear

weapons available to all in-
terested countries. ‘‘Only when
one nation fears another can
mutual respect between nations
be truly attained,’ reasoned
“Big Daddy.”

Amin promised to regain
power in Uganda and said he
considers the frequent com-
parisons between himself and
Adolph Hitler ‘‘a compliment,
in the sense that Hitler
dominated the world despite his
difficult start and a physical
handicap. I have nothing
against Hitler because he wish-
ed to fight the war to unify
Europe.”

In the interview, published in
Le Figaro, the former Ugandan
dictator also chided newspaper

editors for the photographs
they’ve printed of him. ‘‘They
always selected the worst
photos which made me look like
an overfed monkey,” Amin
said.

Kennedy 7-4

Ladbrokes, a London agency
which runs hundreds of street-
corner betting parlors, lists
Sen. Edward Kennedy a 7-4
favorite for the Democratic
Party’s presidential nomination
over President Jimmy Carter in
1980. But if Carter beats those
odds, the gamblers give him a
2-1 chance of keeping his job.

The London gambling agency
said that it began taking bets on

the U.S. presidential race in
response to ‘‘public demand.”

Disco Bombing

A 22-year-old Virginia man
was arrested last week in con-
nection with the tear-gassing of
a popular Fairfax City disco-
teque.

Patrick William Samson was
charged with maliciously
releasing a tear gas cannister in
The Library disco, according to
police. Nearly 200 customers
were evacuated from the
nightclub when the tear gas
grenade was thrown through
the front door.

Twenty people were treated
for tear gas inhalation.

 

 
 

 

 

Isaac N. Smith Jr.

 

by Dave Dudka

Isaac N. Smith Jr., of
Charleston, W. Va., has been
elected to serve a six-year term
on the Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees.

Smith, who is executive vice-
president of Kanawha Banking
and Trust Co. of Charleston,
told the Ring-tum Phi in a re-
cent telephone interview that he
is “‘very flattered’ at being
elected to the Board and that he
hopes to ‘‘preserve the fine
standards of Washington and
Lee.”’

Prior to his election, Smith
worked actively with the West
Virginia alumni association and
said that he hopes to be able to
continue his work with them in
the future.

Smith said that he considers
“maintaining the quality of the

Mock Convention Report

The Ring-tum Phi, November 8, 1979, Page 3

W&L Appoints Trustee

University’’ as his principle
goal. This, according to the new
trustee, refers not only to
academia, activities, and social
affairs, but more importantly to
“train the student for leader-
ship roles.”’ Smith views this as
one of W&L’s greatest
heritages.

Three of the University’s
most important aspects, as seen
by Smith, are the honor code,
the size of the school, and the
student-teacher ratio. Students
at W&L are not only taught by
professors (unlike most larger
institutions where graduate
students often teach many
classes), but also the small
class size allows students to talk
to and get to know their
teachers, who Smith sees as
always ‘‘willing to help.”

These features of intimacy
could be lost in a larger college,
and Smith strongly believes
“the size of W&L should be
maintained if at all possible *

One of the University’s most

positive forces, according to the
new trustee, is in the person of
President Robert E.R. Huntley.
Smith is an enthusiastic sup-
porter of Huntley’s many
achievements and has been im-
pressed with him not only as a
particularly able ad-
ministrator, but also as a fine
teacher and leader.

Before going to W&L, Smith,
a native of Charleston, attended
the Mercersburg Academy and
Charleston High School. At
W&L he was co-captain of the
football team, received his B.A.
in 1957 and graduated from law
school here in 1960.

Since graduation he has been
associated with Kanawha Bank-
ing and has’ undertaken
graduate studies at North-
western’ University (in 1962)
and Rutgers (in 1972).

Other business affiliations in-
clude the presidencies of
Kanawha City Co., West
Virginia Land Co., and
Kanawha _ Co.

George Bush: “A Former Almost Everything”

by Carlo Carlozzi, Jr.

After having been considered
three times for the vice
presidency by Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, George Bush
announced in early May of this
year: his Presidential can-
didacy. His announcement was
somewhat overdue. No
Republican aspirant started
earlier than Bush. In 1978 alone,
he toured 42 states laying down
his grass roots organization
which he claims will get him the
nomination in 1980.

George Herbert Walker Bush,
54, is a man with a deep sense of
noblesse oblige. However,
unlike most of his predecessors
of the old Eastern establish-
ment of the Republican party,
George Bush is no liberal, not
even a moderate. Rather, Bush
is running pretty much as a
standard conservative.

His credentials are im-
pressive: Greenwich County
Day School, Andover, youngest

pilot in the Navy and graduated

Phi Beta Kappa in 2% years
from Yale. While at Yale, he
was also a member of Skull and
Bones, captain of the baseball
team and President of the
Senior Class,

Mr. Bush is the former-
almost-everything. He served
two terms as a member of Con-
gress, from Texas, former en-
voy to Peking, former CIA
Director, former Republican

National Chairman in the
darkest Watergate days. He
performed all of these jobs with
ability, if not always brilliance.

In his declaration of can-
didacy, on May 1, 1979, Mr. Bush
said he wasn’t promising ‘‘a
new deal’’ or ‘“‘a new Founda-
tion’’, but rather, he was offer-
ing ‘‘a new candor.”’ Mostly due
to his background, Mr. Bush
has been speaking almost en-
tirely about foreign policy.
What he says about foreign
policy is generally tough and
conservative.

Bush opposed the Panama
-Canal treaties, and now re-
mains cautious on the Salt II
treaty. Bush contends that his
CIA assignment fortified his
that the Russian
challenge is dangerous. On the
Salt II treaty, Bush stated that
“the fact is that under this trea-
ty we are virtually unable to
monitor whether the Soviets
comply with its terms.... when
it comes to vertification of Salt
II, Jimmy Carter will ask us to
trust the Soviets as he once ask-
ed us to trust him... But I say...
that a treaty that can not be
verified tomorrow shouldn’t be
ratified today.”’

George Bush favors the ERA,

thinks that the CIA has been
undercut and opposes a tax cut
without a cut in federal spen-
ding. He favors nuclear
development, favors a shared
reduction in government
regulation of business, a phase-
out of some of the social pro-
grams dating to the Kennedy-
Johnson years. Bush favors a
supply-oriented energy pro-
gram including oil-price decon-
trol and a “‘windfall profits’’ tax
with a strong ‘‘plowback’’ pro-
vision to encourage oil develop-

ment, and sharp tax cut to move
the economy forward.

A big problem for George
Bush is the fact that he is not a
household name. This, though,
can be rectified as the elections
of 1976 showed us with the
nomination and eventual elec-
tion of Jimmy Carter to the
White House.

Depending on the poll read,
George Bush’s name can go
from non-existent to leading the
field of names. A June
Washington Post poll of 1,976
Republican delegates showed
Bush running third, at ll per-
cent, following former Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan and John
Connally. Ina survey conducted
by the Christian Science

Monitor in late July of 1979, of
Republican leaders, George
Bush led the field as their
nominee for president, with 27
percent, over 24 percent for
Reagan and 22 for Conally.

Most recently Bush scored a
campaign coup in Iowa, site of
the nation’s first delegate-
selection caucuses in January
and the state where Jimmy
Carter first made his mark in
1976. Bush can hardly hope to
defeat Reagan, whose Iowa ties
date from his days as a Des
Moines sportscaster. However,
a strong second-place finish in
Iowa would give Bush an early
advantage over other
Republican candidates. Bush is
hoping Iowa will be for him
what it was for Carter in 1976.

Halloween Night

 

Local Youths Attack Fraternity

by Alan Kenrick

Some teenage Lexington
youths apparently damaged the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house and in-
jured two of its members during
activities Halloween night.

In a night described by police
as historically low in van-
dalism, teenagers broke a
number of windows in the SPE
house, hit one pledge with a bot-
tle, and beat up a member.

Four girls, who apparently
planned to hit the house with
eggs, had come to the door
repeatedly during the evening,
while more friends waited at
the street, talked to members at
the front door, then left. They
showed up again, this time with
eggs in their pockets and in-
dicated their intentions,

whereupon two house members
smashed the eggs in the girls’
pockets, frustrating their plans.
The girls returned later with
four more friends, two of them
male, and burst inside the
house. One of the original group
announced, “This house is
dead!’’ Seconds later, before
members had time to react, a
number of French windows
were broken by cans of
chestnuts hurled from outside.
A Boone’s Farm Apple Wine
bottle, similar to one seen
earlier in the possession of one
of the teenagers, broke a storm
window
bedroom.
Members ran outside at this
point, whereupon one pledge
was hit in the face with a bottle

in a_ second floor -

which glanced off his cheek,
broke, and cut his lip. None of
the offending youths were
caught, and members in the
house attributed the damage to
another fraternity.

License plates on_ the
teenagers’ cars were traced
and some children of W&L pro-
fessors were found to be involv-
ed. The names of most of the
vandals have been uncovered
and many are students at Lex-
ington High School.

A member of SPE, Glen
Koontz, stated that SPE does
not wish to press charges if they
can only be reinbursed for the
damages. Charges of van-
dalism and assault will be
pressed if they receive no more
cooperation, said Koontz.

Student Charged With Hit And

Run, Driving Under Influence

A Washington and Lee senior
was arrested Friday morning
and charged with one count of

_ driving under the influence of
alcohol and one count of hit and

Sgt. Marvin Hamilton, who
made the arrest at 1:50 a.m.,
said the accident occurred at
approximately 1:24a.m.

Several freshmen rushed out
of the Gilliam and Grahme-Lee
dormatories after hearing the
accident.

“I thought two cars had col-
lided head-on,”’ said one dorm
resident who was reading in bed
when the accident occurred.

The collision was the second
hit and run accident involving a
W&L student this year.

Student Jumped

The final assault came, in a
related incident, when SPE
member Bob Forsyth was at-
tacked by ten of a predominate-
ly black group of youths.

Forsyth related to the Ring-
tum Phi that he was returning
home just as the violence
erupted and pursued one of the
teenagers to the vicinity of the
Presbyterian church at Main &
Nelson streets where he lost
sight of him.

Walking back to the house,
Forsyth saw a group of about 30
youths standing across the
street near the Lyric Theater.
Crossing the street down by the
Methodist church, he was ap-
proached by about ten youths.

One asked, ‘‘Did you find the
guy who trashed your house?’’

Forsyth replied, ‘‘No, but I
know what he looks like.”’

Youth: “Do you see him here
(with us)?”

Forsyth: ‘‘No.”’

Youth: “Well, he’s probably
one of our friends, and we’d
hate to see one of our friends get
in trouble.”

At this point, several youths
surrounded Forsyth and pum-
melled him. Forsyth managed
to escape and ran down an alley
by the church but was
trapped at the other end by ad-
ditional youths who tripped him
and kicked him repeatedly on
the ground until he got to his
feet and fled, returning home.
Forsyth finished his statement
by saying he did wish to trace
and prosecute his attackers.

Student Files For
Assault And Battery

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has filed charges against a
Hampden-Sydney student for
assault and battery, stemming
from an incident at Sweet Briar
College.

Timothy Reid Harris, a W&L
sophomore, filed charges this
week against Billy Harrison of
Hampden-Sydney with the
Amherst County  sheriff,s
department.

Harris said he was in the dor-
mitories at Sweet Briar around
midnight on Oct. 18. Harrison
was allegedly spraying a fire

extinguisher, and when Harris
ran to him to try to make him
stop, Harrison hit him in the
mouth with the fire  ex-
tinguisher.

Harris said one of his teeth
was knocked out, four more
shattered, and he required
many stitches inside and out-
side his mouth. Harris said he
spent about three and a half
hours in the emergency room in
Lynchburg and four hours in the
dentist’s chair in Richmond, his
home town.

Married Life At W&L

(continued from page 1)

December. The Perkins find they have to
schedule their already limited time
around her.

Debbie handles all the cooking and
cleaning, which Sam says is an ad-
vantage, as it “frees up a certain amount
of time” for him. ‘I’m taking more than
giving right now,” he admits, ‘but that’ll
change. It’s a two-way street.”

In the case of Jay and Penny Norfleet,
who were married in June, Penny also
does the majority of the housework, as
well as doing volunteer work at the Lex-
ington branch of the ASPCA. They feel,
as do the other couples, that the hus-
band’s studies must take precedence
over other activities. Jay is carrying a

stiff Commerce school workload, in the |

interest of ultimately owning and
operating a classics and art film theater,
with Penny’s assistance, in their home
town of Memphis.

None of the husbands cited any real
academic difficulty as a result of mar-
riage. On the contrary, grades have tend-
ed to rise. Joe Olive, also a senior Com-
merce major, says he experienced a
period of adjustment following his
August, 1977, marriage to his wife, Bar-
bara, and their subsequent move to Lex-
ington, during which his grades fell. This
was only a temporary problem, however,
and since then, his grades have improv-
ed, a result, he thinks, of his greater
responsibility and better time-budgeting
ability.

Irregular daily schedules and a lack of
time spent together are problems cited
by all the couples. Most of the wives, like
Kathy McNulty, whose husband, Ray, is
a senior double-majoring in Sociology
and Journalism, work, often contributing
a great deal to the family’s support.
Kathy works at a variety of jobs,
waitressing at Pizza Hut and (as does
Barbara Olive) The Cockpit, doing typ-
ing and babysitting. A trained secretary,
she, like some of the other wives, is
discouraged at the lack of good job op-
portunities available in Lexington. Pen-
ny Norfleet noted that Lexington
employers seem particularly reluctant to
give jobs to out-of-town people who do not
plan to be year-round residents, or to

allow much time off during college vaca-
tions. Consequently, most of the married
students, to accommodate job schedules,
spend the majority of their vacation time
in Lexington.

The amount of time spent apart, plus
the difficulty of making trips hone even
during holidays, tends to make the lives
of married undergrads, and particularly
of their wives, rather lonely. The transi-
tion from family life in locations as
diverse as Long Island, Michigan, and
Tennessee to an all-male school in rural
Virginia was, in most cases, not an easy
one. Barbara Olive, for instance, came
from a Long Island family of four sisters
and, after only a few weeks of marriage,
was thrown into the W&L scene—a scene
offering almost no female companion-
ship, and where, as Joe Olive remarked,
a major problem ‘‘is getting guys to keep
their hands off my wife.”’

In a similar vein, Debbie Perkins
notes, partygoers from the nearby
women’s colleges are occasionally
shocked to find the object of their atten-
tions is married. At fraternity parties

‘ (Sam is president of Chi Psi), ‘girls will

come up to me and say, ‘Who’s that guy?’
I say, ‘That’s my husband,’ and get some
pretty strange looks.” Pledges also are
frequently surprised to find that a
member of a “‘wild’’ college fraternity is
married, although the husbands who are
or were frat members maintain that
marriage hasn’t really strained those
relationships. Jay and Penny Norfleet
are called ‘“‘Mom and Dad’’ by his Sigma
Phi Epsilon brothers, and Ray and Kathy
McNulty are referred to as Mr. and Mrs.
MeNulty when they drop by parties at Fi-
ji, his former fraternity.

Joe Olive and Ray McNulty maintain,
however, that their social lives have
changed considerably since marriage,
though Joe, at least, did not expect quite
such a radical change. Having lived in a
house with three other guys his
sophomore year, he had established sort
of a pattern of late nights of drinking and
playing cards. Following his marriage,
however, “‘one night of staying out till six
playing cards and that was that!”’

They have also found that married
couples tend to associate primarily with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other married, or at least engaged,
couples, and while the men still have
single friends, the women usually don’t.

Joe Olive also remarks that Staunton
and Roanoke are ‘‘fine for entertainment
if you’re married,” although not
especially recommended for the single
guy looking for kicks.”

All agree that a real benefit of mar-

riage, from both a social and financial ©

point of view, is the elimination of con-
stant phone calls and visits back and
forth. During the year Ray and Kathy
McNulty were engaged, for example,
“the phone bills were incredible—we
were writing each other every day, too.”
During that year, Kathy came to W&L
for the big social weekends, with Ray
returning to their hometown of Brent-
wood, Long Island on many of the in-
tervening weekends. All things con-
sidered, however, they find they aren’t
really seeing that much more of each
other, between his studying and part-
time sports information office job and
her working. “I have weekends free,”’
complains Ray, ‘‘and that’s when she’s
working double shifts!”

Five of the nine undergraduate couples
live in Davidson Park, the university-
owned “‘barracks” apartments located
between Washington and Nelson Streets,
where most of their neighbors are law

Ray and Kathy McNulty

students and their husbands and wives.
Most of the couples feel that the
reasonably-priced apartments are the
main concession the university makes to
married students, although Ray McNulty
and Sam Perkins both cited the ex-
cellence and helpfulness of the Financial
Aid program here, especially useful to
self-supporting couples subsisting
primarily on loans, grants and part-time
jobs.

Several of the couples noted, however,
that they did not feel particularly a part
of the law-oriented Davidson Park Com-
munity, where the existence of the mar-
ried undergrad faction occasionally
seems forgotten.

In general, though, the undergrad
couples seem pretty content with their
current status. Early marriage is not an
easy thing to do—parental resistance has
to be overcome, responsibility has to be
assumed and, as Penny Norfleet says,
“you have to make certain decisions—if
they fail, it’s our fault only.’’ Still, the
benefits are there, and, if he felt he’d
missed anything by being married when
he did, Sam Perkins quickly replied,
“From a single student’s point of view,
yes; from my view, no.”’ That statement
seems to capture the state of affairs
among married undergraduates at
Washington and Lee.

 

Couple Establishes Unitrust To Benefit W&L

A “‘‘Unitrust’’ valued at
$305,000 has been established to
benefit Washington and Lee
University by a Gloucsster, Va.
couple, Mr. and Mrs. James
Bland Martin.

A Unitrust is an irrevocable
arrangement that provides the
donor with a lifetime income
and an immediate, substantial

income-tax deduction. Under -

certain circumstances it results
in no capital-gains taxes, and

estate taxes on the value of the
trust will be eliminated or
reduced.

When the Unitrust terminates
on the deaths of the donor-
beneficiaries, the charitable re-
mainder comes to Washington
and Lee for a purpose chosen by
the donors.

Mrs. Martin is a member of
Washington and Lee’s Board of
Trustees. Her husband, a 1931
W&L law graduate, is the

retired founding partner of the
Gloucester law firm of Martin,
Hicks & Ingles.

The Martins’ Unitrust con-
sisted of 12,265 shares of stock
in United Virginia
Bankoucester. That bank grew
from the Bank of Gloucester,
founded by Mr. Martin’s father
before World War I.

When the Martin Unitrust
comes to Washington and Lee,
the Martins have designated the
funds to establish an endow-
ment in honor of the late Frank
and Louise Gilliam, Mr.
Gilliam, who died in 1976, was
dean of students and director of
admissions at W&L for more
than 30 years. Mrs. Gilliam was
extremely active in The Garden
Club of Virginia, as Mrs. Martin

 

has also been, and it was
through that association that
the Gilliams and the Martins
became lifelong friends.

Because of the terms of the
Martin Unitrust, the donors will
receive a greater annual in-
come from the trust assets than
before the creation of the
Unitrust.

In addition, an immediate
income-tax deduction of more
than $100,000 resulted from the
gift. And because of the
Unitrust’s irrevocable

charitable nature, they will in-
cur no capital-gains tax liabili-
ty.

Glasgow Endowment
To Present One-Man Show

“Exit Burbage,’ a title deriv-
ed from the epitaph on
Shakespearian actor Richard
Burbage's tombstone in Lon-
don, is a one-man show, an
Elizabethan entertainment
starring Peter Whitbread,
renowned Shakespearean actor
in his own right. The play will
be presented at Washington and
Lee University for one night on-
ly, next Wednesday (Nov. 14) at
8 p.m. in the Troubadour
Theatre. Admission is free and
the public-is invited.

Sponsors for the performance
are W&L's Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee and the
Department ot English and
Fine Arts.

As the greatest
Shakespeare's age,
Burbage was the original
Hamlet, Othello, Lear and
Richard III. But he was only
one star in a family that has
been called ‘'the first first fami-
ly of the English theatre.”’ The
family saga began in 1576, when

actor of
Richard

James Burbage built ‘The
Theatre’ — the first permanent
Playhouse and the first resting
place for the wandering actors
of English drama. James’ older
son, Cuthbert, used the timbers
of The Theatre to build the
legendary Globe in 1599. And
there the younger son, Richard,
acted out most of Shakespeare's
tragic heroes.

In the role of Burbage, Whit-
bread combines a series of anc-
cdotes, readings from contem-
porary writers, and excerpts
from the plays of Marlowe, Jon-
son and Shakespeare. The in-
tention of the play, according to
Whitbread, is to ‘show
Shakespeare as a man, rather
than piece of bookish history —
and the period in all its vivid
reality.”

The selections in “Exit Bur-
bage’’ illustrate a variety of
dramatic styles, ranging from
Marlowe's ‘‘Tamburlaine’’ to
Shakespeare's ‘“‘Richard III.”

Whitbread dons female clothing
to portray the Nurse in ‘“‘Romeo
and Juliet,’ pointing out that all
female parts were enacted by
men at the time.

A section featuring the fat,
cowardly Falstaff
demonstrates the use of
character make-up. And on hs
goes through the cycle — from
tragic heroes Antony and
Othello to the ‘‘wise fools.’’ All
the parts are presented with
changes of costume and props.

Born in England, Whitbread’s
first professional role was
Romeo at the Old Castle
Theatre, Farnham, in 1951.
Since then, he played leading
roles in most major repertory
houses. He toured with Sir John
Gielgud in Africa in ‘‘Richard
II’ and ‘Much Ado About
Nothing,’’ then to Moscow in
Paul Schofield’s ‘‘Hamlet,’’ the
first English company to play
that country since World War I.

Movie Review

More American

Graffiti

By Dash Coufal

 

MORE AMERICAN GRAFFITI

Written and Directed by B.W.L. Norton
With Paul LeMat, Ron Howard, Cindy
Williams, Candy Clark & Macenzie Phillips

At the end of American Graffiti they told us
how things turned out, thus giving away the
ending of any sequel.

Another handicap of More American Graf-
fiti is that the end of the original was the last
time the characters would all be living in the
valley.

Add to that the absence of two stars
(Susanne Sommers and Robert Dreyfus) and
the writer/director of the original, and one
can easily understand why the sequel fails.

The brilliance of American Graffiti was
that it captured an age. It was a cross section
of a Southern California valley. It gave one
the flavor of the early sixties. The sequel
repeats that flavor in one episode, but fails to
capture anything of the late sixties.

The unity of American Graffiti was one of
its strengths. Though there were several
stories being told, they all affected each other
and all share a deadline on their resolution.

The stories were indeed intertwined. The
sequel tells four stories on four different New
Year's Eves. The stories are only intertwined
by being told simultaniously through cross-
cutting. None of the stories affect each other
and only once does anybody make reference
to another story: Toad tells us that LeMat
died a year previous (gee, Toad, you gave it
away.) To make it more annoying each story
has a different screen size.

The first story is by far the best. Paul
LeMat is the drag racer who we were told at
the end of the original, was killed by a drunk
driver. They save the story by choosing not to
concentrate on this; rather they show him
winning a race on New Year’s Eve Day
(remember, it doesn’t snow in Southern
California). He also meets and establishes a
rapport, of sorts, with an Icelandic girl who
can’t speak English. It’s a very human se-
quence that perhaps has the most in common
with the first movie. But he gets it.

Toad goes to Viet Nam and is filmed with a

screen size that’s like looking through a peep-

hole, very annoying. This just isn’t the Toad
of the first movie, it’s only the same actor.

The character of Toad is violated and the plot

is only fair up to the real un-Toad-like ending.

Yes, Ron Howard marries Cindy Williams,
but at first not all is happy. Cindy wants a job
and Ron says she had to take care of the kids.
Cindy runs off to talk to her brother and ends
up in a grossly brutal police riot and Ron
saves the day’ My only question is what ever
happened to the party they were supposed to
throw that evening? It’s about as foamy as it
sounds.

Cindy Clark is in Height-Ashbury, but
where is the plot? She had a very nice hat, and
seems to be having trouble with her old man
(hip lingo for a paramour), but really I can’t
sympathize with this vaporous plot. The
screen size, that is screen sizes, are annoy-
ingly psychedelic. Some kind of bad trip,
man.

One last word on Ron Howard: even if he
can grow a natty red moustache I still can’t
accept him as being a day over fourteen.

writing, Whitbread returned to
the stage in ‘Exit Burbage,”’
which he devised and produced.

of the Warsaw Autumn Festival
in 1977, and has been received

Record Rewiew

Root Boy Slim’s Latest

by Mark Kinniburgh

Root Boy Slim has just releas-
ed his second album on Illegal
Records, and be advised the
record stores may not have any
Root Boy Slim and the Sex
Change Band in its racks for
sale.

The new album is called
“ZOOM”, and it features all the
attributes that made the first
release by Root Boy great, and
even more new _ production
twists from Donald Fagen and
Gary Katz (of Steely Dan fame)
make this a must for fans and
those who can get into bizarre
music.

Let me explain ‘‘bizarre™
Root Boy Slim and the Sex
Change Band come from the
Washington, D.C., area, and
have been local favorites for
many years. As the name of
these strange art-rockers
spread and as they became
more accepted by cult ‘Root
Boy Rooters,’ the tales of the
band with the ‘‘great lyrics”
and ‘‘funny’’ stage show
preceeded them all over the
country and, of late, England.
The music is supplied by an ex-
tremely tight musical back-up
group and a chorus of female
vocalists dubbed the ‘‘Rootlet-
tes."

I mentioned lyrics, and lyrics
they are in the greatest sense of
the word, as Root Boy has given
a fine representation of his ex-
periences throughout his event-
ful life. (Including prep schools
anda Yale diploma! )

In his song ‘‘Do the Gator,”
he observes quite casually
“There’s a dance you can
do/Ifyou’re drunk like me/Get

down and Boogie/Horizontal-
ly!’’ In another tune ‘Dare to
be Fat’’ we are told of a 202 lb.
sweetheart that Root Boy drools
over, and how to “‘have a ball
with cholesterol.”

On to the stage shows that ac-
company The Sex Change Band
in concert, just a look at the
album cover will suggest what
this band is capable of and more
so, what to expect from Root
Boy in his next U.S. tour to ac-

* company ‘‘ZOOM.”’

The ‘“Root’’ glasses and
“Stoned’’ headgear are
trademarks of Rootboy from
wayback. Cut from styrofoam
and glued together in various
alphabetical configurations,
these glasses are then placed on
the head to resemble sun-
glasses. Where the motivation
lies for the music, glasses or
general Root boy Slim and the
Sex Change Band attitude is not
really important, but I really
wonder if Root Boy has
anything on his mind besides a
good time.

“ZOOM” will be a national
success and one can even ex-

pect to see some preferred
selections on AM radio by next
summer. I give it an “A” with
honors for crazy. But please, be
patient with local record con-
cerns as it is difficult to obtain
copies at this early date, and
those receiving a few albums
will probably already have sold
them.

NOTES: The Knack is record-
ing their second a album in L.A.
— can't wait!...more notewor-
thy, Jeff Beck will have a new
album out in early 1980 — his
first since ‘Wired’ in 1976...
The Fabulous Poodles’ new
album, “Think Pink,”’ is out on
Epic and really doesn't
measure up to ‘Minor Star’’—
all sounds the same.... Joe
Perry of Aerosmith has left the
band to go solo, but he does ap-
pear on the new Aerosmith LP

Roadside Theater Relates
Appalachian History

by John Wells

‘‘T love stories,’’ says Don Baker.

For the past five years he has helped make
folk stories, so strongly evocative of mountain
lore and tradition, into an art form. His
traveling group, the Roadside Theater, has,
since 1974, taken a collection of stories and
music indigenous to the Southern Ap-
palachian area and developed them into a
program that looks as far removed from for-
mal theater as listening to tales on Aunt Min-
nie’s porch. But it is theater, and on a level
that can be understood and related to back in
the hollows and coal camps where conven-
tional theater is unheard of.

The scripts used by Roadside are derived
from the oral history of the area, and many
stories and songs were originally gathered as
part of the W.P.A.’s Writer’s Project in the
middle 1930’s. Its style may be attributed to
the traditional story-telling associated with
southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky.

The Theater’s program, Brother Jack, was
presented at the Troubadour on October 10 by
the Glasgow Endowment Committee.

Don Baker graduated from Washington and
Lee in 1968, a drama major. He un-
characteristically began the show here by
personally telling the tale which provides the
show's title, “‘Pretty Polly.’’ The only real
prop used in the entire show is a rocking chair
set in the middle of the stage. Baker agrees
that there is ‘something special about a live
performance.” His credits include Waiting
For Godot and the title role in Richard I.

He thinks it is important for home folks to
be exposed to the regional theater. ‘They
have the tube,” he says, ‘‘and they can watch
the tube comfortably.:’ But, your average
resident of Drift, Ky., is not likely to sit inona
performance of Shakespeare or Beckett and
receive any great amount of edification.
Roadside Theater, with its stories and music,
is familiar to them.

Much of the charm of the program may be
attributed to the players, three of them: Ron
Short, from Dickinson County, N.C., who,
with Baker, wrote the script; Tom Bledsoe,
who, like Baker, is from the Wise County
area; and Angelyn DeBord, a South Carolina
girl who supplies the spark of feminine wiles
to the show.

The stories are accompanied by songs
which run parallel in theme, and which repre-

sent a reservoir of traditional music, ac-
cording to Short. As a reaffirmation that the
process goes on, Short is able to compose
music that is compatible with other songs in
Brother Jack that are generations, even cen-
turies, old. This, he says, gives the music a
‘new identity.”

Tom Bledsoe provides much of the humor in
the show, as the glint in his sharp eyes would
indicate. Long, straw-colored hair, and a
beard—the type normally associated with a
Confederate renegade or Gabby Hayes—add
a physical dimension to the proceedings
which, along with superb timing and rapport
with the other players, make up for the
absence of props.

To Bledsoe, the ideal theater is Fuller’s
General Store in Snowflake, Virginia. It is
essential to strive for this effect, he says, to
“get the closest you can get to that at-
mosphere.”’

It is hard to imagine what the show would
be like without Angelyn DeBord. She wears a
simple brown print dress, the ruffled
shoulders of which she raises or lowers,
depending upon the age and nature of the
character she plays. Her hair is used to
marvelous effect: pulled back tight as Gran-
ny, tale tellin’ from her rocker; loose and
seductive as the Devil’s Daughter; complete-
ly wild-looking in the hilarious ‘Hairy
Woman” sketch. Unlike some of the others,
offstage, Ms. DeBord’s country accent
doesn’t change.

“What I love,”’ she says, ‘‘is goin’ back to
the hollers, and seein: the reaction of the peo-
ple back there to what we do. They love it!
And if they think you didn’t tell that story just
right, now, they ain’t a bit afraid to grab you
by the arm and say ‘Now listen here...’ ”’.

The populace of the Southern Appalachians
are grateful for having theater brought to
them by Roadside, but it is important that this
fascinating, restricted element of our culture
can be dramatized for others to appreciate as
well.

Roadside travels all over the south, has per-
formed Off Broadway in New York, and was
featured at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival
in Washington, D.C.

Don Baker’s love for stories and his native
heritage have become an entertaining pro-
gram that is an important mirror of the dis-
tant, and not-so-distant, past.

agree with that type of fraterni-
ty activity, and said ‘‘I don’t
forsee it happening again.”

Phi Kappa Sigma was also
placed on one year hazing con-
duct probation for ‘‘kidnapp-
ing” a pledge and tying him toa
Wilson Field goalpost last Tues-
day.

According to Farrar, the IFC
received a report last week that
a Phi Kap pledge involved in a
raid on the fraternity house had
been “grabbed actives, taken
into the house, had mustard
dumped in his mouth, and was
generally trashed.”

The pledge was then
reportedly taken to Wilson
Field, stripped, and tied to one
of the goalposts. It was reported
that girls had been present dur-
ing the kidnapping, said Far-
rar.

Phi Kap member Andy Wiley
said the report was ‘‘greatly ex-
aggerated.’’ According to
Wiley, who was present at the
incident, the pledge hit and ac-
tive member with two eggs dur-
ing the raid at dinner last Tues-
day. He was then grabbed by
fraternity members and
‘mustard was put on him” said
Wiley. ‘‘No mustard was put in
his mouth.”’

After taking a shower, the
pledge was found to a goalpost
on Wilson Field, from which he
“easily freed himself,” ac-
cording to Phi Kap President
Ab Boxley.

Boxley added that the pledge
was not completely stripped of
his clothes, and that there was
no girls present.

“It’s not like we went up to
the dorms and kidnapped so-
meone,’’ Boxley commented.

When asked if he condoned
raids, Boxley said, ‘“yes—
probably everyone in this room
has done it, particularly the
seniors. Nobody ever minded.
And there’s no way now that we
could do what was done to us
when we were freshmen.”

“I just can’t see getting riled
up about this penny-ante stuff.”’

Phi Kap was not fined
because the pledge provoked
the action and was at the house
on his own free will, said IFC
Secretary Sam Perkins.

Both decisions by the IFC
Judicial Board are subject to
approval by the Student Affairs
Committee, which will ‘review
the cases at a meeting Thurs-
day night.

The Judicial Board also
agreed Tuesday to investigate
allegations by Sigma Phi Ep-
silon Pres. Chris O’Connor, that
his fraternity house was
damaged last Saturday by
members of Phi Gamma Delta.

EARN OVER $
WITH ARMY ROTC.

Before you ee from college! Because now, you can com-
e Army Reserve or National Guard with ye

ROTC. It’s called the Simultaneous Membership Program (SMP).
And, depending on your academic year when you enter, SMP
can help you earn over $6,500.

Here’s how it works. If you qualify and a vacancy is available,
you become a member of an Army Reserve or National Guard unit
as an officer trainee and, at the same time, enroll in the Army
ROTC advanced course at your college. Your Reserve or Guard
membership will pay you at the minimum level of Sergeant E-5, and
you'll receive $100 a month during the regular school year as an
ay | ROTC advanced course cadet.

t the end of your second year of advanced ROTC, you'll be

6,500

 

commissioned a second lieutenant and, assuming there’s a vacancy,
serve with a Guard or Reserve unit while you complete the require-
ments for your college degree. Upon graduation, you may con-
tinue service with a Guard or Reserve unit while rears your
civilian career, or you can, if you prefer, compete for active duty as
an Army officer.

So if you’d like to earn over $6,500 while you're still in college,
get into SMP. Because SMP can help you do it. You can bank on it!

Liberty Hall Excavations: Artif

by Parker Potter
The Liberty Hall ar-
chaeological excavation,
directed for seven years by Dr.
John McDaniel, is a project of
which the University can
rightfully be proud.

It is a fine example of how the
resources of a small teaching
university have been mobilized
to support a research project
the equal of any in the state of
Virginia.

A great point of pride with
McDaniel and others associated

with Liberty Hall is the fact that
our work is a valid and produc-

Close-up view of the uncovered structure.

tive academic exercise, and at
the same time a project of great
significance to the ar-
chaeological community in
Virginia and beyond.

Archaeology first. Liberty
Hall is a unique site in many
respects. Washington and Lee is
one of the very few schools that
can archaeologically examine
its early history. W&L’s

predecessors hopscotched their
way down the valley, arriving
here, in the town of Lexington,
in 1803-after 54 years of moving
around. (Most colleges seem to
have stayed

disturbing the remains of
earlier structures. )

Ours is not only the first pro-
ject to investigate the Scotch-
Irish west of the Blue Ridge in
Virginia, but it is one of the very
first applications of historic ar-
chaeology in the western part of
the state.

Even the brand of historical
archaeology being practiced at
Liberty Hall is exciting. Much
of the work at Williamsburg and
other Tidewater areas is
directed toward stocking period
room displays and fleshing out
established and documented
histories.

However, at Liberty Hall we
are using a cultural approach to
historic archaeology to
challenge a number of deeply
rooted historical misconcep-
tions concerning the early years
of Rockbridge County.

Many local histories and
popular stories (now being
challenged by historians too)
paint a picture of cultural isola-
tion and great peril in
Rockbridge County well into the
late eighteenth century. Indian
massacres seem to receive par-
ticular attention in these ac-
counts, accounts accepted by a
large segment of the local
population.

Armed with these, the only
available historical concepts at
the time, McDaniel and his first
crews expected to find evidence
of a frontier existence at Liber-
ty Hall. But the artifacts could
not have contrasted more vivid-
ly with the local historical tradi-
tion.

Among the 25,000 artifacts ex-
cavated at Liberty Hall are a
wide range of British ceramics,
Chinese porcelain, English but-
tons, French gunflints and
Dutch and English pipes.

This wide range of imported
commodities, which reached
Rockbridge with amazing
speed, as well as the general
paucity of arms-related ar-

 

tifacts, underlines the fact that
Rockbridge in the last decades
of the eighteenth century was
hardly a perilous frontier area.

But the truly exciting aspect
of the findings at Liberty Hall is
the fact that ours isn’t a project
carried out in the name of the
University by a group of
graduate students and profes-
sionals, as is the case at many
institutions.

Students Do Survey Project

by Jim Feinman

Seventeen Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students are currently involved in an
intensive archaeological survey project
under the auspices of Dr. John M.
MeManiel, advisor to Washington and
Lee’s Regional Office of the Virginia
Research Center for Archaeology in
Williamsburg.

The students are responsible for ex-
cavating several sites that are suspected
to have been occupied by settlers during
the late 18th and early 19th centuries.
The sites are located in the western half
of Rockbridge County in the vicinity of
Big House Mountain.

The long-range goal of the project is to
provide insights into the culture and lives
of the predominantly Scotch-Irish people
who were the first colonists to occupy the
area.

The W&L students are supported in

this educational program through a
grant from V.R.C.A. The grant provides
annual funding for the Washington and
Lee Regional Office. The grant is used to
hire a full-time archaeologist and to
cover expenses incurred by the regional
office.

W&L was chosen as one of five regional
offices by the Virginia Commission of Ar-
chaeology in 1978. The selection was in
recognition of W&L’s intensive ar-
chaeological project at Liberty Hall.

The major responsibility of the
regional office is to assess the impact of
proposed construction projects on poten-
tial archaeological sites. Another role is
to place sites on the National Register of
Historic places. The Historic Preserva-
tion Act of 1966 provided for the

Any site that is placed on tnis National
Register is immune from any construc-
tion or other disturbance that may
damage or destroy it.

Other responsibilities of the regional
office include education and research in
the field of archaeology. It is in this
aspect that most of the students are in-
volved. The students, most of whom are
enrolled in an upper level archaeological
survey course, are conducting research
on several sites that could be of im-
portance in determining the cultural,
commercial and industrial activities of
the earliest settlers in the area.

The research the students are involved
in consists ofthe intensive excavation of
the area in which the site is located. Ar-
tifacts are collected, cleaned and stored.

After the area is sufficiently excavated
the students will offer interpretations of
the site. These interpretations will help
to educate the students and others on the
lives and culture of the colonial ancestors
of Rockbridge County.

Dr. McDaniel offers an explanation of
the importance of these studies: ‘“‘We are
confident our focus will provide valuable
insights concerning the first settlers in
Rockbridge County. We are proud of the
fact that our effort brings historical ar-
chaeology west of the Blue Ridge and in-
to an area of chronological focus for
which our knowledge is still inadequate.
Our data should allow a more precise
understanding of 18th and 19th century
cultural adaptations. For today:s inhabi-
tant’s of the area, our findings should in-
crease their appreciation of the culture
and accomplishments of their
ancestors.”’

dividuals in the field as it does
must certainly be counted as a
credit toW&L.

Over the course of five sum-
mer field seasons, three dif-
ferent outside groups have been
brought in to work with us at
Liberty Hall, two of them for
four years each.

In addition to exposing people

McDaniel has attracted for
Liberty Hall grant money total-
ing over $43,000, most notably
from the Greenbaum Founda-
tion, the Virginia Bicentennial

It should be noted, though,
that none of our work at Liberty

without the tremendous support
offered by Washington and Lee

On balance, the Liberty Hall

It is the type of project which

Speaking Of
Sports...

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

After four years of fan apathy at W&L, wasn’t it
nice to see a packed house at the gym last weekend?
And at a water polo match yet?

And isn’t it a shame that after an outstanding four-
year career at W&L, Stew Atkinson couldn’t go out a
winner?

 

Speaking of W&L football, if anyone can explain
what happened last Saturday on Wilson Field, I’ll give
you a nickel.

Wasn't it nice to see cheerleaders at a W&L football
game the past two weekends? Wouldn’t it be nicer if
W&L had their own cheerleaders again?

While we’re on the topic of cheerleaders, aren’t
those pro cheerleaders great during a boring N.F.L.
game?

Speaking of pro football, aren’t you tired of watch-
ing the Deadskins every Sunday? Especially when the
Cowboys and the Giants were playing a thriller last
weekend up in New Jersey while the Skins were get-
ting clobbered by Pittsburgh in the Dull Bowl?

It doesn’t look like anyone is going to beat Pitts-
burgh again this season, does it?

Getting back to T.V. football coverage, when will
sportscasters learn to speak English properly?

Changing sports, it’s free-agent time again in
baseball. Isn’t it amazing what some of these guys are
going to get paid for playing a game they enjoy?

Back to W&L, isn’t it nice that the basketball
Generals will travel to Europe to share the great
American dream? And don’t forget the goodwill tour
of the Bahamas?

And isn’t it amazing that over 40 college-educated
lacrosse players would push a bed 50 miles along a
highway? Doesn’t it seem more logical to raise
money by doing something constructive for the com-
munity?

Will Bill Devine still be able to kick barefoot as cold-
er weather approaches Lexington?

Has Rich Hachenburg won the starting job as
W&L’s QB? Or will we still play musical quarter-
backs?

Moving on to the Olympics, will N.B.C. be able to
cut through the Soviet Union’s ‘‘red”’ tape and provide
unregulated coverage of the 1980 summer Olympics?

And back to the pros, can Larry Bird lead the
Boston Celtics back the the N.B.A. playoffs?

Finally to boxing, isn’t boxing dead without the
shenanigans of Muhammed Ali?

And despite winning his first professional bout,
wouldn’t it be wiser for Ed ‘“‘Too Tall”’ Jones to return
to football while he still has control of his senses? And
if he does decide to stick to the ring, maybe he should
get Billy “‘Sucker-Punch”’ Martin to manage him.

Oh yeah, did you know that Arizona State Universi-
ty’s controversial recently-fired football coach,
Frank Kush, played a year of freshman football at
W&L? He never completed a semester.

Generals Embarassed;
Down 41-0, Lose 55-21

By Dale Park

The W&L football team drop-
ped its third game in a row last
Saturday in a 55-21 rout at the
hands of the Maryville Scots.
The loss lowered the Generals’
overall season record to 2-7.

Maryville combined an ex-
plosive offensive and im-
pressive special teams effort,
scoring touchdowns in all but
one of their first six posses-
sions.

“We are a young team,” said
Head Coach Gary Fallon. ‘“‘We
started off poorly against
Bridgewater two weeks ago and
against Maryville last week.
The team is still looking for a
leader.”

While Scots’ running backs
Ken Adair and Alvin Nance
combined for 205 yards on the
ground, the Maryville defense
held Generals’ tailback Stewart
Atkinson to only 47 yards on 21
carries.

Maryville beat W&L in a
variety of ways: running, pass-
ing blocking and _ returning
punts.

Midway through the first
quarter, the Scots took over at
the W&L 27 yard line after a
General fumble. Three plays
later, Maryville quarterback
Dave Kibben scored on a kep-
per to put his team in the lead
7-0.

Yet the glaring weakness in
the Generals’ defense was its in-
ability to stop the screen pass.

The Scots scored on their next
two possessions using screen
passes of 44 and 36 yards. Both
plays were run to the left and
caught the Generals out of posi-
tion.

Fallon explained, “We fell
behind early and the tendency

is to press too hard to try to get
back in the game. Some of our
young players still lack the
discipline to stay in their areas
and as a result, Maryville beat
us on the screen plays.”

The second quarter
highlighted Maryville’s special-
ty teams.

Seconds into the period,
Scots’ linebacker Keith Martin
blocked a W&L punt which
teammate Larry ~ Wright
recovered in the Generals’ end-
zone for a touchdown. Kick
Cary Starnes added his fourth
point-after as Maryville rolled
to a 28-0 lead.

Unable to move the ball on its
next offensive series, W&L
punted to Scot return man Steve
Moffett. Moffett took the ball at
his own 47 yard line and spurted
53 yards for another Maryville
touchdown. The point-after at-
tempt failed, and the Scots took
a 34-0 halftime lead.

The second half saw the
return of sophomore Rich
Hachenburg at quarterback for
the Generals and an offensive
recovery.

“Hachenburg: came into a
tough situation and did a fine
job for us,”’ said Fallon.

Hachenburg completed 11
passes for 166 yards — all in the
second half — and helped im-
prove the Generals’ offensive
output from 26 total yards at the
half to 283 yards at the end of
the game.

Scots’ running back Adair
opened the third quarter by go-
ing 65 yards on a trap play for a
touchdown and gave Maryville
a staggering 41-0 lead.

Hachenburg’s passing lead to
the Generals’ two scoring
drives in the third quarter, the
first culminating in a pass from

Hachenburg to tight end Syd
Farrar and the second ending
with a one yard plunge by
freshman tailback Pat
McGuire.

The touchdowns put W&L on
the scoreboard and cut an insur-
mountable Maryville lead to
41-14. “For most of the fourth
period,” said Fallon, ‘we
substituted freely, trying to
give our younger players a feel
for real game action.”

Yet Maryville continued to
pour on the offensive pressure.
Scots’ -running back Melvin
Douglas plunged in from the
one yard line early in the fourth
quarter to up the score to 48-14.

Hachenburg responded
several minutes later with a 19-
yard touchdown pass to Atkin-
son making the score 48-2] in
favor of the Scots.

Maryville was not content,
however, as Scots’ quarterback
Mike Wortman set up a third
and final screen pass to
Douglas, who raced 30 yards for
the score with only 4:28 left in
the game. The successful con-
version iced the 55-21 Maryville
victory.

On the afternoon, the Scots’
wishbone offense rolled up 383
total offensive yards, gaining
an incredible 6.5 yards per play.

The Generals will faee
Georgetown University in their
final game of the season next
Saturday. “The Hoyas, like the
Scots, run out of a wishbone on
offense,’’ said Fallon.
“Georgetown also has a tough
experienced defense.”

Georgetown was ranked
seventh in Division III East last
season and has half of last
year’s 22 starters returning.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.
 

Richmond Wins Again |As / See It:

As W&L Takes Second

In Conference Tourney

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
took second place in the
Southern Water Polo Con-
ference Championships held at
W&L last weekend. The Rich-
mond Spiders ended up as the
Conference Champs.

W&L played four games,
defeating Georgia Southern and
Duke, and losing to Richmond
twice. The Generals first game
was against Georgia Southern,
with W&L winding up on top by
a 15-8 margin.

W&L’s main objective in the
game was to contain the con-
ference’s leading scorer,
sophomore Eric Peterson, who
is respectfully known around
the league as “‘Rocket-arm”’.
This job was delegated to
seniors Mike Foley and Bob
Newcomb, who handled it well
enough to come up with the win.

The next game the Generals
played was against Richmond,
who had earlier defeated Duke.
Richmond won the game bya
score of 9-5.

The first half of the contest
was a display of water polo at
its best, with effective offense
and successful defense played
by both teams before a capacity
crowd.

W&L entered the second half
down by one point, but their
failure to execute properly in
“man advantage’’ situations
prevented their taking the lead.

In the fourth quarter, Rich-
mond was able to capitalize on
errors made by the W&L
defense in their last minute ef-
forts to come from behind.

The third game for the
Generals was a must win game
with Duke University, a team
which W&L had played three

times earlier in the season, with
each game being decided by a
one point margin. The winner of
the game would go to Easterns
in Chicago, and also get a shot
at Richmond the next day.

An improved man advantage
game, a fine team effort, and
superior conditioning on the
part of W&L gave them the vic-
tory, 17-7. W&L’s coach Page
Remillard cited the game as
‘‘an indication of the improve-
ment our team has made since
beating Duke by one here two
weeks ago.”’

The final game was played
between W&L and Richmond. A
W&L victory meant that the two
teams would play a third time
to decide the championships.
Richmond won the game 10-6,
ending the Generals’ hopes for
their first conference cham-
pionship.

Kichmond opened the game
with a fast break offense which
allowed them to jump out to an
early 3-0 lead. But after a time
out and some offensive
changes, the Generals came
back with two quick goals of
their own, and the first half end-
ed with W&L down by one, 5-4.

There are times when
everything goes right for a
team, and the third quarter was
that time for Richmond. Every
slightly errant pass was picked
off by the Spiders and turned
back on W&L.

It seemed as if every time
they touched the ball, the Rich-
mond players could find some
strange way to get a score. The
Spiders scored several ‘‘fluke”’
goals but Remillard stressed
the fact that it was Richmond’s
athletic ability which created
those flukes.

Despite the fact that the
Generals lost the final game,
Remillard was pleased with
their play, and praised it as
‘much improved’’ over their
previous Richmond game.

By virtue of their second
place finish, the Generals have
earned the right to compete in
the Basterns to be held at
Chicago Circle this weekend.
Competition at Easterns will be
extremely tough, and as
Remillard put it, “Should we
win a game at the Easterns, it
will be W&L’s biggest water
polo victory.”

Remillard commented on the
tournament play of Drew
Pillsbury, who played extreme-
ly well and with “a total
disregard for pain.” The coach
also praised the play of Mike
Foley, whose defensive game is
good enough that he “could
have played on any team on the
East Coast’.

The water polo Generals now
hold an impressive 19-5 record,
with three of the five losses
coming at the hands of Rich-
mond.

There is always a tendency to
judge an entire season by the
team’s performance against its
main rival, but this should not
be the case. Despite the fact
that.W&L lost three to Rich-
mond, they beat them once, and
that was something that had
never been done before.

And a record of 19-5 is
something that is not to com-
mon to W&L athletics. Says
Remillard: “I just hope people
realize the tremendous growth
that the water polo program has
experienced this year.

Last Chance

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Before I commence with this week’s column, let me
make one thing perfectly clear. I am not trying to add
injury to insult. W&L lost, last Saturday, 55-21. The
score just about says it all.

I thought I would mention this for two reasons.
First, trying to cut down a team after it has been
beaten by 34 points is similar to rubbing dirt in the
face of someone who has already been knocked down.
Second (and most importantly), I don’t want my face
rearranged by anyone holding a grudge against me.

But what happened against Maryville cannot go
without any mention. The Generals lost to a team that
was better in almost every facet of the game. W&L
was not defeated by the Scots — they were thoroughly
beaten. es

Look at the ways Maryville scored. They did it in
almost every possible way. The Scots scored on two
short runs, one long run, three long passes, a blocked
punt and a punt return.

But by humiliating W&L, Maryville was actually
doing the Generals a favor. The W&L coaching staff
got to see a welltuned offensive machine and, hopeful-
ly, they were able to see just how much their own of-
fense must be realigned in order to become as potent
as Maryville’s.

Maryville rolled up 55 points because their offense
is diverse. Diversity — remember that word. The
Generals did not start playing with a diverse offense
until the second half. Unfortunately, they were five
touchdowns behind at the time.

The staple of Maryville’s offense are two
breakaway runners — Alvin Nance and Ken Adair.
But did these running backs hurt the Generals with
their running? No, they were much more effective
with their pass receiving. It was the combination of
Adair and Nance on long screen passes which did the
most damage.

And while Maryville was moving the ball with a
combination of runs and passes, the Generals stuck to
their original game plan — no matter how far they fell
behind in the first half. As Maryville went further and
further ahead, the W&L coaches stuck with their
time-consuming, ‘‘three yards and a cloud of dust’’-
style football. Fortunately, they finally saw the light
and loosened up the offense in the second half. Had
they not, it is very likely W&L could have been shut
out.

Here is the big question. Why did the coaches wait
until the second half to change their strategy? Why
did the coaches wait until it was too late before they
varied the offense?

In the second half, the Generals threw more to the
tight-end and set up more screen passes. One tight-
end pass was good for a touchdown while another set
up a short run. The Generals’ other touchdown was
the result of a screen pass. Just why the coaches do
not use this type of offense for four quarters is beyond
me.

If the Generals want to beat Georgetown, they
should do the following. First, start Rich Hachenburg
and give him a chance to make things happen. None
of the other signal-callers seem to be able to generate
as much offense as does Hachenburg.

Also, why not throw on first down? Too many times,
the Generals will run up the middle on first and se-
cond downs, leaving them with third and impossible
situations. In other words, the Generals should say
the hell with being conservative. There is only one
game left in the season; there is no tomorrow.

Please, gentlemen, stop running plays straight out
of ‘‘The Knute Rockne Story.’’ You may win or you
may get run off the field, but when you’re 2-7, you
can’t be choosy. If for lack of any better reason, then
do it for the Gipper.

Dougal: A Jack Of All Trades

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Who is that friendly elderly gent taping ankles in the training
room? It’s W&L’s newest trainer Tony Dougal.

Dougal — a member of the National Training Hall of Fame, a
former professional football and baseball player and the former
coach of six different intercollegiate sports — has been assisting
W&L head trainer Tom Jones with his duties in the training room
and on the sidelines. Most of Dougal’s work has been with the soc-
cer team.

And the soccer team seems to be more than pleased with the
training staff's newest addition. ‘Not only is he a very good trainer,
but he’s such a nice guy. He’s great,”’ said one member of the soc-
cer Generals.

Dougal, an energetic man in his 70s, is a 1933 graduate of Temple
University in Philadelphia. There he lettered in football, basket-
ball, boxing and baseball while majoring in business and physical
education. At Temple, he played football under the legendary coa
Pop Warner.

After graduating from Temple, Dougal played professional foot-
ball as a guard with the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL. A four-
year pro, he also pitched for the Boston Red Sox.

During his stint as a professional athlete, Douglas also served as
athletic director, physical education teacher and coach of also
sports at Smithport High School in Pennsylvania. In 1937, Dougal
went on to coach basketball, boxing and wrestling at West Texas
College.

For the next eight years, he coached football, lacrosse and ice
hockey at the University of New Hampshire. In 1942, his football
team was undefeated. While at New Hampshire, he received his
master’s degree in anatomy and rehabilitation from Columbia
University in New York.

Dougal moved to Dartmouth College in 1947. There he served as
head trainer and assistant coach of football, lacrosse and ice
hockey. After 15 years at Dartmouth, Dougal moved to Boston
University where he was the school’s head trainer and instructor
and supervisor of corrective therapy classes.

Upon retiring from B.U. in 1976, Dougal and his wife, Lucile,
moved to Tampa, Florida. Shortly following this move south, he
became director of aquatics at Eckerd College.

During the spring, Dougal worked with the St. Louis Cardinals
baseball team helping pitchers with sore arm muscles. He also
worked as a part-time scout for the Detroit Tigers.

While in Florida, Douglas became associated with a new sport —
jai-alai. In addition to working at the jai-alai fronton in Ocala, Fla.,
he also worked as the trainer at the Tampa Jai-Alai Fronton—one

 

 

Dougal, a 50-year veteran of physical training. has also worked
with Olympic teams, war veterans, paraplegics and polio victims.
During his career as an athletic trainer, he has attended to athletic
stars such as Pele.

Dougal believes strongly in the preventive and therapeutic

aspects of physical conditioning. ‘I always felt that conditioning
was very important. Each muscle has a job to do and if it isn't
strong enough, it gets sore or injured. The idea is to build up those
muscles so that injuries are prevented,’ he explains.

It is this philosophy that Dougal has brought to W&L. Wishing to
stay in contact with training and still keep his retired status,
Dougal sent an inquiry to W&L with the intention of working as an
assistant trainer.

With W&L needing an extra hand in the training room, this prov-
ed to be a convenient opportunity. ‘We've needed another trainer
around here for the last couple of years... especially in the fall. One
trainer is not enough. There's football, soccer, cross country, water
polo, fall tennis, fall lacrosse, fall baseball and basketball practice.
We havea graduate assistant (Peggy Hogan), but she’s in class two
days a week," explained head trainer Jones.

Enter Tony Dougal.

The arrangement between Dougal and W&L seems to be an ideal
situation for all parties concerned. W&L is getting Dougal’s expert
service which it needed, and Dougal—an assistant trainer but not
considered part of the W&L faculty—can maintain his retired
Status and still stay involved with athletic training on the college
level.

And how have Dougal's services been appreciated at W&L?

oe s doing a great job for us,” said Jones, ‘and the kids love

of the top jai-alai locations in the United States.

Lax Team Completes Bed-Push

by Mare Birenbaum

The Washington and Lee
‘acrosse team had a workout
Sunday they may never forget,
although some of them might
‘want to.

Strangely enough, it involved
t bed, several policemen, and,
after a 10-and-a-half-hour trek,
alot of soreness.

But then, not every workout
‘Will yield between $2,000-$2,500
‘n donations to the team.

That's the amount of money
“o-captain John Hooper
‘astimates the team earned Sun-
‘ay in pledges from people who
sponsored lacrosse team
members to push a bed from
Hollins College to Zollman’s
Pavilion. The marathon bed-
push was the lacrosse team’s
datest episode in their quest to
finance their planned nine-day
nid-winter trip to Bermuda.

Head Coach Jack Emmer
astimates the cost of the trip,
‘which is scheduled for Feb.
16-24 during W&L’s mid-winter
preak, as being about $7,500.
rhe team is scheduled for two-
a-day practice sessions each
day there, something they say
they cannot effectively have in
Lexington because of the
weather.

Prior to last weekend, the
team’s major fund-raising ac-
tivity, had been, selling ‘|acrosse
hats.

It all started at 4a.m. Sunday
when. 17 members of the
lacrosse squad gathered at the
University Center for the ride to
Hollins. Once at Hollins, the fun
began. Two people pushed the
bed while two others acted as
flagmen to keep traffic away
from the rolling bed.

Soon, though, one of the axles
supporting the frame of the roll-
ing bed began to crack, ac-
cording to team manager
Palmore Clarke. The problem
was soon rectified by ad-
ministering athletic tape to the
axle and then conductor tape.

But that was the least of their
problems. After the first four
hours of the push, the team had
pushed the bed only three miles.

A policeman soon visited the
expedition and informed the
team that the permit they were
issued was for hiking on the side
of the road, not for pushing a
bed. Furthermore, according to
Clarke, the officer said that the
permit was from W&L to
Hollins—not the other way
around.

The frame was then dismantl-
ed and two pieces of wood were
inserted on each side of the mat-
tress. Soon the team began jog-
ging, the pace picked up and it
was said to resemble a relay
race. Reinforcements came
about 11 a.m. when the bed mat-
tress, which was now being car-
ried like a stretcher, was out-

- «side of Buchanan, Virginia:

“After about 35 miles,’ said

co-captain John Hooper, ‘‘some
of the kids were losing faith.”
He said it was not overly en-
couraging when he saw a sign
that said Lexington was 15
miles away and then further up
Route 11 a sign said Lexington
was 16 miles away.

Around 3:30 p.m., after the
bed frame was reassembled, a
lacrosse player's girlfriend was
put on the bed, and, clearing the
identification check asked of
them by some policemen near

the pavilion, the marathon end-
ed to cheers of those attending
the S.A.B. party at Zollman’s.

Monday, members of the

“It was a long day, an ex-
asperating day,’ said Hooper

‘and it will help us.’

Law Ill

Wins IM
Grid Crown

by Marc Birenbaum

Law II built up a 1946
halftime lead and held off Pi
Kappa Phi 19-13 to capture the
Washington and Lee intramural
football championship last
Thursday.

Law II quarterback William
Jeffrey teamed up with
Buckner Wellford and threw
three first-half touchdown
passes. Pi Phi scored in the first
half on an 80-yard kickoff return
by freshman John Buttaruzzi.
The frat’s final score came with
moments left in the game. After
making the extra point, a Pi Phi
onside kick failed and Law II
held on for the win.

In addition to Edwards and
Wellford, another key player
for the winners was lineman
Dave Weaver, said Joe Olive,
student director of W&L's in-
tramural program and head of-
ficial at the championship
game.

With three playoff wins, the
law team—which also won the
Division II crown—finished the
season undefeated with a
record of 8-0. In the semifinals,
second-seeded Law II beat Phi
Kappa Sigma 25-19. Pi Phi beat
number one seeded Delta Tau
Delta in the semifinals, handing
the Division I champs their first
defeat of the season and ousting
them from the playoffs.

Both semifinal games were
decided in overtime.

Reflecting on the intramural
football season, Olive expressed
his concern over the “ongoing
problem” of fraternities not
always supplying referees. “'l
got most of my referees from
Coach Lord’s refereeing class,’
said Olive. He also said he
thought there was a decrease in
blatant roughness in the foot-
ball games this year.

“Football worked out very
well despite the lack of fields
and the rain,”’ he added. This
year the intramural football
program was restricted to only
two fields instead of the four
allowed in previous years, he
said.

Outdoors:

by Jim Feinman

It is still not too late to get into
the field for pre-season scouting
before the opening of hunting
season. Quail, grouse, rabbit
and turkey become legal game
cn Monday and deer season will
commence the following week
on Nov. 19.

The single, most important
element to pre-season scouting
is time. The hunter should
spend as much of it as possible
in field or forest. Since most
hunters do not enjoy the luxury
of ample time to devote to
scouting (not to mention actual
hunting!) It is necessary to
utilize whatever time is
available in the most produc-
tive manner possible. Just one
or two afternoons of intelligent
scouting will greatly enhance
the possibility of a heavy game
bag on opening day.

Intelligent scouting, over-
simplified, is to locate suitable
terrain with ample food and
cover for the desired species.
Quail, for example, will often be
found in heavy cover adjacent
to a pine wood or in areas that
have been clearcut in the past
two or three years and have a
high density of primary growth.
Quail will often feed in
harvested grain fields which
are accessible from deep cover
of any kind. The birds will ven-
ture into the fringes of the field
in the early morning and late
afternoon for a usually short

Game Scouting

feeding period.

Grouse are generally found at
higher elevations than quail,
although in Rockbridge they
will often be found in the same
cover. A typical grouse covert
would be the thickest cover in
the area that is often en-
compassed by an impenetrable
tangle of grape vines.
Overgrown orchards and fringe
areas such as an abandoned log-
ging road or a dilapidated fence
line are also likely spots.

Turkeys forage on a variety
of food, ranging from grasshop-
pers to acorns. A good way to
locate turkeys is to search for
scratchings. A turkey scrat-
ching is an area that the bird
has pawed clear of leaves while
searching for food. The scratch-
ings are quite obvious and spur
prints can often be seen in the
‘disturbed dirt. A flock of
turkeys will greatly disrupt the
forest floor and it is occasional-
ly possible to determine the
direction of their path by close-
ly examining the scratchings.

Keep an eye out for roosting
areas that turkeys will often use
habitually. A roost is identified
by the large amount of dropp-
ings found underneath it. A
single large evergreen tree ina
predominantly hardwood forest
is worth hiking to as turkeys
will occasionally pick this tree
out for a roosting site.

(Next week: Deer Hunting.)

 

 

 

Booters

by Chris Sisto

Last Sunday, the varsity soc-
cer team completed their
season with a disappointing 2-1
loss to rival VMI. Despite the
defeat the Generals improved
over last season and showed
some promising signs for the
future.

The Generals’ overall record
for 1979 was 5-7-1, as compared
to last year’s mark of 3-8-2.
Head coach Rolf Piranian was
pleased with his team’s im-
provement despite missing the
chance for a .500 record with a
win over the Keydets.

As Piranian stated, ‘I’m
sorry about missing the even
record but we went out as win-
ners. We had several op-
portunities to win and fought to
the end.”

The winning goal for VMI was
scored with about five minutes
remaining in the game. This
came after W&L freshman
Brad Poorman tied the score
early in the second half.

The game was very close
throughout as there was no
score at halftime and the shots
on goal were also fairly even.
The Generals had 15 shots to
VMI’s 11. W&L’s player of the
game was midfielder Dana
Samuelson.

In last Tuesday’s game
against Virginia Wesleyan, the
importance of team play was.
demonstrated as the Generals
won 1-0 and denied Wesleyan an
NCAA tournament bid for the
second year in a row.

The player of the game was
given to the entire team. Pira-

nian explained by _ saying,
‘Everyone on the team con-
tributed an equal and important
factor in the victory.”

Looking back at the season,
Piranian was pleased with his
team’s play, saying that toward
the end of the year the squad
was playing the best soccer he
had seen at Washington & Lee
in the past four years.

“After the Radford game
(seventh of the season), the
team Jost many of its in-
consistencies,’’ said Piranian.
We have no regrets about what
happened this year. The team
played good soccer and improv-
ed a lot over last season,’’ add-
ed the coach.

This is especially true of the
defense, which allowed eight
fewer goals than last year and
tied the school record of five
shutouts in one season. The
goals against average for the

year was 1.76.

The offense did not show
much of an_ improvement,
however. They scored only one
goal more than last year and
had a .846 goals a game
average.

Piranian explained this by
saying, “Our problem on of-
fense was not a lack of talent
but a lack of cohesiveness.
Overall, | am proud of the team
this season.”’

The outlook looks optimistic
for next season. The Generals
will lose only four seniors, two
of whom started.

Five freshmen who started
this year, should also return
and play better with a year of
experience behind them. The
new captains for the 1980 team
are Brian Williams and Mark
Turner.

In other soccer notes W&L’s
“B”’ team finished out their
season with a 2-6-1 record.

Sobering Thoughts

The hit-and-run accident involving a Washington
and Lee student driving under the influence of alcohol
(page 4) brings to mind some disturbing thoughts
about our liquor comsumption and the rising in-
cidence of alcoholism throughout the nation.

Our society has practically sanctified the use of
alcohol as an acceptable recreational drug. No one is
very concerned in this country with the mass general
use and abuse of alcohol. When a number of leading
senators, congressmen, and other influential citizens
are forced to endure the painful ordeal of alcoholism,
we can summon only feelings of sympathy, smug in
our self-assurance that it can never happen to us.

But this national lackadaisical attitude rings false,
and we know it. Some 200,000 deaths a year are at-
tributed to excessive drinking. The federal govern-
ment estimates that seven percent of the adult
population in the United States suffer from alcohol-
related problems—that’s about 10 million Americans.
For college age citizens, the estimates hover even
higher—around 19 percent.

The costs of supporting our national alcohol habit
are staggering, too. An estimated $43 billion is lost
each year in lost job time, decreased productivity,
and health care. Is it any wonder that we have an
alcohol problem in this country when the liquor in-
dustry spends $310 million a year on advertising to
promote our habit with the aid of generous tax deduc-
tions? By comparison, the federal government spent
$313 million in 1976 to combat alcoholism through
various programs.

We bring all this up not in advocacy of abstinence
and teetotalism, but as a _ recognition that
alcohol abuse is a serious problem in this country.
The W&L campus is not immune. You probably know
someone who is becoming an alcoholic right now; it is
a process that takes a number of years to evolve. But
you will probably ignore the signs until it is too late—
we havea tendency to close our minds to the problem.

We can only echo the thoughts of others on this pro-
blem: ‘‘The sad fact is that those who challenge the
drinking habits of Americans and the pervasive use of
alcohol as a social crutch—the climate in which
alcohol flourishes—are too often ignored or, worse
yet, attacked for calling attention to this insidious
phenomenon.”’

Editor’s Judgement Questioned

To the Editor:

As a former college
newspaper editor and as a spec-
tator at the Oct. 20 Honor Trial,
I was satisfied with your
coverage of the event. I must
object, however, to the story,
“Phi Editor Ejected,” which
appeared beneath the piece on
the trial.

The story consisted of several
quotes from the editor, attack-
ing the note-taking ban at the
trial. I have three major com-
plaints about the article.

In the first place, an editor
who prints an exclusive story
about himself does so in poor
taste. Such an effort is an
egobuilding puff which at-
tempts to prove what a macho
crusader for freedom the writer
is.

A good editor is a newsman,
not a news-maker bent on giv-
ing himself free publicity. Your
story casts a shadow of doubt on
your ability to understand your
role on this campus.

Secondly, your piece painted
an inaccurate picture. You fan-
cied yourself the hero, battling
the oppressive Executive Com-
mittee and Student Bar
Association. In truth, you were
the abusive culprit.

You failed to mention that you

Persiflage

were warned before the trial not
to take notes. A sign outside Lee
Chapel boldly stated that no
note-taking was permitted, and
the Chairman repeated this
caveat before the trial began.

I agree that an accurate ac-
counting of the facts was impor-
tant, but this does not justify
your violation of an established
policy.

Responsible newspersons
play by the rules even if they do
not agree with them. You acted
improperly in taking notes and
thus have no excuse to attack
the rule you knowingly violated.

Finally, a front page news
story should never contain the
editor’s opinions. If you must
complain about the treatment
you received at the trial, do so
on your editorial page. To at-
tempt to pass your views off ina
news piece is, to say the least,
unprofessional.

The ‘“‘story”’ of your ejection

was an abuse of your editorial
powers. You were not reporting
news; you were grinding a per-
sonal axe on page one.
_ Cheap shots such as this force
me to nod in accord when I hear
others refer to your paper as
“The Rag-tum Phi’’ and other
unprintable epithets.

Parents Weekend

Dear Editor,

Why can’t we drink in the
library?

A child must be about 13 mon-
ths old before it is mature
enough to hold a cup. I don’t
think there are very many pro-
digies this young at Washington
and Lee. Last Friday night, I
did see some fraternity
members spill their drinks. I
doubt this was due to lack of
practice at holding a cup.

Smoking is offensive to a
large number of people. No one
has ever complained about the
smell of my coffee. There aren’t
even special rooms for drinkers
in the library.

There are a large number of
garbage cans in the library. I
can hit two from my carrel with
a crumpled first draft. I don’t
believe the addition of coffee
cups and coke cans to the
general debris and tobacco

juice will overload them.
While I hate to belabor the
point, I study better with

something to drink; be it coffee,
tea, coke, or water. Don’t tell
me about the water fountain; I
have to interrupt my train of
thought to get up and get a
drink. As far as library coffee
goes, if I’m still awake from two
to six in the morning, I’m not in
the library studying. |
If drinking in the library
helps us study more effectively
and adds relatively few pro-
blems to the administration of
the building, why is it pro-
hibited?
George Irvine ’8]

Thanks

Dear Editor,

On behalf of the United Way,
we would like to thank Pres
Henderson, Cockpit night
manager, for his help and
cooperation during the benefit
show we put on last Saturday
night.

Thanks are also extended to
the students who came and
donated their dollars to support
this year’s fund drive. Forty-
five dollars was collected at the
door and has been handed over
to Penny Henneman, a United
Way worker.

We are encouraged by the
response to charity in the face
of other entertainment in the
area last weekend, and plan to
make next year’s benefit bigger
and better.

Sincerely,
Burr Datz
Chris Rohrs

My parents arrival this wekend has in-
troduced a little added pressure into my life.
It’s not that I don’t like seeing my parents, I
mean, sometimes they actually are fun to
have around. It’s just that their immediate
presence seems to interfere with what I see to
be one of main purposes of college.

I came to school, at least partly, to learn
how to handle my own affairs. For the first
time I was making my own decision and liv-
ing with the resulting consequences. Obvious-
ly, over the years I’ve developed my own set
of values on which to base my actions. This is
how it should be for any responsible young
man.

But this process of developing values and
recognizing responsibility is interrupted
when my parents visit and review my actions.
Suddenly, events that I can accept as a nor-
mal part of life require precise and logical ex-
planations. Occassionally, we differ in inter-

preting the results of some of these actions.
For example, I was pretty happy when that
paternity suit was dropped. But all my

. parents could say was that I had been pretty

lucky that the girl had been lost in that freak
boating accident.

Another time, I felt I was pretty clever in
turning state’s evidence when they caught me
with those few pounds of reefer. Yet, instead
of congratulating me on my sharpness, my
parents chose to emphasize the fact that I was
doing something illegal.

With reactions like that is it any wonder
that I haven’t told them that I’ve been runn-
ing numbers to help pay for that small three
car accident I had after the grain party?

It just seems to me that I’m never going to
learn responsibility if they don’t let me
develop my own set of morals. I mean, it
worked for the prodigal son, so why not me?

Letters To The Editor

Coeducation Would Make W&L A Better School

Dear Editor,

I have to agree with one of
Randy Talley’s statements in
his letter to the editor last week.
Randy told us he had to
“wonder about the type of
students we now have.” Our
student body is, as the catalog
states, quite diversified, as soon
as we disqualify half the human
species. We talk about honoring
tradition, avoiding distractions,
and fostering a unique at-
mosphere. I think we should try
to restrict our discussion to
this: would coeducation make
Washington and Lee a better
school?

Traditions are, admittedly,
often a valuable addition to
campus life; the honor system,
for example, makes a positive
contribution to a student’s ex-
perience here. But we should
not cling to traditions under the
assumption that traditions are
intrinsically good. Times do
change, and change renders
some traditions obsolete. We
are living in a world that re-
quires more and more coopera-
tion between the sexes, and the
skills learned at parties are not
the skills that are going to be
most valuable in a few years.
We are going to have to learn to
work with women rather than
concern ourselves solely with
drinking and dancing with those
women.

It is a nice escape to be able to
see a date on the weekend and
then forget her during the week.
But college years should teach
us that we cannot avoid our pro-
blems and_ responsibilities
simply by watching those pro-
blems come and go when we
please. If there are problems
with girls on the weekend, we
should learn to deal with those
problems during the week, too,
rather than be able to avoid
those dealings by sending dates
forty miles away after the
weekend. Learning to face pro-
blems is part of the maturation
process.

We do form firm friendships
on this campus. But we also
learn that friendship is for
males, and it is difficult to have
friends who are girls;
girlfriends are-the only alter-
native. The result is a stifling
social system that pressures
students to find beautiful dates
to show off to other students. It
is nearly impossible, subse-
quently, to avoid thinking of
women as mere objects for
weekend amusement. We con-
struct codes concerning the ac-
ceptability of talking to a
friend’s date: we cannot seem
to be “moving in” on the
friend’s ‘‘catch,” and again we
fail to make friends with a
female. Friendships between
males are an important part of
our social relationships, but
without friendships between
males and females, we get only
a one-sided view of life.

Some students say the single-
sex aspect is a unique feature
that sets us apart from three
thousand other colleges in the
country. I certainly agree that
characteristic sets us apart, but
I wonder if that is the trait we

want to distinguish us. Why
can’t we be unique in the quality
of education we offer, rather
than in our status as one of the
few remaining all-male col-
leges? There is no inherent
value in remaining all-male;
there are some advantages in
being in a top-flight school. We
should direct our attention to
improving the diversity and
talents of the students, thus
distinguishing Washington and
Lee among the nation’s col-
leges.

Proponents of the single-sex
system point out that social life
is quite active—there are often
more girls than guys at frat par-
ties, and the girls’ schools are
nearby if the guys get anxious.
That sounds terrific, but there
are a couple of problems. First,
I find it difficult to classify a
sixty-minute ride over moun-
tain roads as a quick trip to a
“nearby” girls’ school. That is
the smaller problem, however.
Now, the bigger problem. We
might have a great school here
if the social life were as good as
many contend and if social life
were the only facet of college
life. But those who support the
single-sex concept because the
social life is adequate fail to
note the importance of other
facets of college life, notably
academics. Coeducation offers
the chance to hear the woman’s
side of issues—in and out of the
classroom. Especially in
literature and history courses,
this perspective would be a
valuable addition to the class
discussion. With no women in
the classroom, it is almost in-
evitable that male students will
stereotype women as partiers
who have no interest in
academics.

Another strong anti-coed
argument is that W&L offers an
alternative to coeducation. At
first glance, that is a puzzler.
But should we offer that alter-
native when there is so little de-
mand for an all-male school?
Did our 1400 undergraduates
apply here because this is an
all-male school? I hardly think
so; I know I didn’t. Then did
half the students apply for that
reason? Again, I think not. Then
how many of our students are
here because they wanted to at-
tend an all-male school? A
fourth? A seventh? a tenth? I
only know that in my three-and-
a-half years here, I can’t
remember meeting anyone who
said he came here for that
reason. Then do we remain
single-sex to benefit a tenth or
less of the student body?

Back to the main question:
would coeducation make
Washington and Lee a better
school? Because our applicant
pool would double, enhancing
the possibility of our getting
better students; because
students would learn to com-
municate effectively with both
sexes in social academic, and
extra-curricular areas;
because there would be
decreased tension as a result of
the ‘“‘normalized’’ social at-
mosphere. I think our school

would be a better school with
coeducation.

A closing point. Transferring
is not an easy solution for
students who are dissatisfied
with the all-male aspect. There
are many factors to consider in
choosing a_ college, and
coeducation is one of those fac-
tors. But other considerations,
including cost, distance from
home, size, course offerings,
and academic quality are also
important, and the mixture of
those factors may be enough to

prevent a student from leaving
school.

Even without mass transfers,
we should note that there is
much dissatisfaction with the
present single-sex aspect.
Whether that dissatisfaction is
a majority opinion is a hotly
debated question. In any event,
I think the bottom line in this
argument is that a shift to
coeducation here would im-
prove the quality of education
our school offers.

Cold Check Procedures Clarified

To the editor:

The purpose of this letter is to
clear up some ambiguities that
have possibly caused some
hostility and resentment toward
the Cold Check Committee. The
committee also wishes to make
public some _ procedural
changes made this year which

_ have not yet been entered into

the ‘‘Handbook.”’

Let me begin by stating the
purpose of the Cold Check Com-
mittee: To safeguard the
privilege of Washington and
Lee students to write checks in
the Lexington area. This is done
by going around to area mer-
chants, picking up student bad
checks and then bringing the
student before our committee to
present an explanation.

The Committee exists under
the auspices of the Honor
System, one of whose purposes
is to maintain an air of reason in
the activities of the school com-
munity. One of these activities
is the use of checking in the
area and it was deemed to be of
sufficient importance to have
an E.C. sub-committee created
for its control. To give an idea of
the scope of businesS we carry
on, the volume of bounced
checks handled by the commit-
tee during the °’78-’79 school
year was over $4,000 and the
amount already dealt with in
the first two months of this year
is approaching $800.

At the request of the E.C.,
after passage of some rather
controversial policy changes, I
present below the major
guidelines followed by Cold
Check:

1) When a student is found
guilty of bouncing a check, he is
subjected to maximum fines of
$10 for the first offense, $20 for
the second offense and $30 for
the third offense. These fines
may be appealed before the
E.C. within 72 hours.

We carry a full line of Cuisinart accessories plus
gift items, jewelry, gourmet foods and candies.

 

2) After the third offense, the
committee has the option of
referring the case to student
control.

3) A students ‘‘slate’’ is wiped
clean after two years. This has
been raised from a period of one
year to increase the penalties
incurred by students who ap-
pear beforethe committee
repeatedly in their 4 years at
W&L and manage to stay within
the 3 offense range due to spac-
ing of their offenses.

4) The Committee will not
convene unless there is a
quorum present made up of five
members. These five members
must include the three officers
plus two members at large.
This is to erase the possibility of
arbitrary decisions made by the
Committee.

5) Failure to appear
before the committee on the re-
quested date constitutes an ad-
ditional offense.

6) Decisions made by Cold
Check are not based on blanket
policies, rather they are made
after consideration of the rele-
vant racts in each case.

7) There are, however, some
common practices which are
the most frequent causes for a
decision to fine the individual.
These are:

—‘‘Floating’’ a check—

writing checks with the expec-
tation of money coming in from

an outside source.

—Math errors resulting from
the lack of proper control a good
running balance affords.

—Closing an account with
checks outstanding.

—Other math errors such as
not accounting for service
charges and those caused by
slackness.

In the event of a bounced
check, the merchant involved is
the one who suffers and the stu-
dent involved must be made to
bear the consequences. I ask for
your careful consideration of
these matters and truly ap-
preciate your co-operation in
making the actions of the Cold
Check Committee flow as
smoothly and as painlessly as
possible for everyone involved.

President’s Commission On Three Mile

The President's blue-ribbon
panel investigating the Three
Mile Island nuclear accident,
known as the Kemeny Commis-
sion, submitted its report to the
nation last Tuesday. The 179-
page report and foot-high stack
of supporting documents detail-
ed many of the human problems
associated with the accident
and the government’s response
to it.

The Commission had several
findings, among them:
—Abolishing the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
—Creating a new. nuclear
regulatory agency, directed by
a single administrator rather
than a panel of commissioners,

Overall Conclusion

Our findings do not, standing
alone, require the conclusion that
nuclear power is inherently too
dangerous to permit it to continue
and expand as a form of power
generation. Neither do they sug-
vest that the nation should move

forward aggressively to develop

additional commercial nuclear
power, They simply state that if

reasons, to confront the risks that

nuclear power

ifter many years of operation
of nuclear power plants, with no
evidence that any member of the
general public has been hurt, the

belief that nuclear power plants
are sufficiently safe grew into a

conviction... The) commission — is
convineed that this attitude must
that

nuclear power is by its very nature

be chinged to. one says

potentially dangerous, — and,
therefore, one must continually
question whether the safeguards
already in place are sufficient to
prevent major accidents...

We note a preoccupation with
regulations. It is, of course, the
responsibility of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to issue
regulations to assure the safety of,
nuclear power plants. However,
we are convinced that regulations
alone cannot assure safety. In-
deed, once regulations become as
tolumninous and complex as
those regulations now in place,
they can serve as a negative factor
in nuclear safety...

Causes of the Accident

. AW hile the major factor that
turned this incident into a serious

accident’ was inappropriate
operator action, many factors con-
tributed to the of the
operators, such as deficiencies in
their training, lack of clarity in
their

action

operating — procedures,
failure of organizations to learn
the proper lessons from previous
incidents, and deficiencies in the
design of the control room. These
shortcomings are attributable to
the utility, to suppliers of the
equipment, and tothe federal
commission that regulates nuclear
power, Therefore—whether or not
operator this
particular case—given all the

error “explains”
above deficiencies, we are con-
vinced that an accident like Three
Mile Island was eventually in-
evitable...

Reflecting
On The NRC

“We kept asking: What do these
guys do? But we couldn't find out.”
— A member of the Kemeny com-
mission, reflecting on the NRC.

by Robert Ruby

Washington — When the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission conducts a hear-
ing to license a new plant, the people best
equipped to offer expert views — those on
the NRC’s panel of independent con-
sultants — are now allowed to testify.

If, before the hearing, the staff
discovers a safety problem affecting not
only the new facility but some already
built, the agency takes the seemingly
logical step of classifying the problem as
““generic.’’ But once the problem is so
labeled, the plant can be licensed without
resolving the problem.

Mr. Ruby is a staff correspondent of the
Baltimore Sun, from which this article is
reprinted with permission.

Such procedures are among many ex-
amples by which the Kemeny commis-
sion laconically set forth last week just
how scary business-as-usual at the NRC
can be.

In releasing a stack of carefully word-
ed reports last week, the President’s
Commission on the Accident at Three
Mile Island documented not the physics
but the troubling sociology and politics of
nuclear energy.

The Kemeny commission—so named
after its chairman, John G. Kemeny, the
president of Dartmouth College—made
nearly four dozen recommendations for
lessening the dangers of the NRC’s and
the industry’s methods, but the 12
members wrapped their suggestions in a
gloomy caveat:

“We do not claim that our proposed
recommendations are sufficient to
assure the safety of nuclear power...,’’
the commissioners wrote. ‘‘We must not
assume that an accident of this or
greater seriousness cannot happen
again, even if the changes we recom-
mend are made.”’

 

Instead of finding what it called a
“magic formula’’ for peace of mind, the
commission directed attention back to an
old and often criticized study of the NRC
and the agency it replaced in 1975, the
Atomic Energy Commission.

That report was the product of 60
specialists working three years and re-
mains the basic study of reactor safety, a
report an NRC review committee this
year also admitted to be “‘inscrutable.”’

If it only could have been more easily
understood, the study would have warn-
ed the regulators that the course of
events last March at Three Mile Island
not only was possible but was more pro-
bable than that to which the AEC and the
NRC committed most of their research
funds.

“So much effort has been expended in
criticism of the report,’’ the Kemeny
commission staff said, ‘‘that little atten-
tion has been paid to the messages it con-
tains.”

The messages for the future include
these: During the 1980’s, a 40 percent
chance exists of at least one accident in-
volving a radioactive release. In the
1990’s, the chance rises to 50 percent. The
Kemeny commission staff concluded
that while those risks are smaller than
many others faced by society, ‘‘accidents

similar to Three Mile Island should be
expected.’’

Joseph M. Hendrie, the NRC’s chair-
man, acknowledged much the same in an
interview last week. ‘The aim in regula-
tion here is to recognize that we’re just
not going to be able to achieve absolute
guarantees,’ Mr. Hendrie said. ‘‘What
you try to do then is identify the high risk
points,”

In the case of $1 billion plants, each
capable of generating electricity for a ci-
ty of 500,000 people; it is hard to decide
where to look first. But the Kemeny com-
mission noted that the NRC has hardly
tried; until a month ago, the agency had
never systematically reviewed the acci-
dent reports accumulated since the first
commercial nuclear plant opened in 1957.

Even at the design stage, many
systems are exempt from review. There
is a type of valve, for example, called a
pressurized relief valve, that played a
major role during events at Three Mile
Island because it stuck open—as similar
valves at other plants had done many

times before.

Reactor manufacturers had _ never
been required to test that particular
design because it was protected by a
backup valve. The Kemeny commission
found that the backup valve never had to
be tested either, since the NRC reasoned
that it was backed up by the first valve.

“If you want to know about airplane
crashes, there’s no great mystery—you
look it up in the almanac,”’ observed Vic-
tor Gilinsky, one of the five NRC com-
missioners. “There’s an uncertainty
about the state of safety of nuclear
power. There aren’t statistics. You can’t
look it up.”’

The problem is not only the regulators.
At Three Mile Island, the Metropolitan
Edison Company (the operator and part-
owner) assigned “technical analysts’’ to
study accidents at other plants. But there
was no requirement that the analysts
have a nuclear background; they were
offered no training, nor any instructions
as to ‘‘what kind of analysis they were
expected to do.”’

Island Presents Its Report To The Nation

evitable, the evidence suggests
that the NRC has sometimes erred
on the side of the industry's con-
venience rather than carrying out
its primary mission of assuring
safety.

Two of the most important ac-
tivities of the NRC are its licens-
ing function and its inspection
and enforcement activities. We
found serious inadequacies in
both...

NRC's primary focus is on
licensing, and insufficient atten-
tion has been paid to the on-going
process of assuring nuclear safe-
ty. An important example of this

is the case of “generic problems,”
that is, problems that apply to a
number of different nuclear
power plants. Once an issue is
labeled “generic,” the individual
plant being licensed is not respon-
sible for resolving the issue prior
to licensing. That, in itself, would
be acceptable, if there were a
strict’ procedure within NRC to
assure the timely resolution of
generic problems, either by its
own research staff, or by the utili-
ty and its suppliers. However, the
evidence indicates that labeling of
a problem as “generic” may pro-
vide a convient way of postponing

decisions on a difficult ques-
tion...

The existence of a vast body of
regulations by NRC tends to focus
industry attention narrowly on the
meeting of regulations rather than
on a systematic concern for safe-
ty. Furthermore, the nature of
some of the regulations, in com-
bination with the way rate bases
are established for utilities, may
in some instances have served as a
deterrent for utilities or their sup-
pliers to take the initiative in pro-
posing measures for improved
safety.

to us what the precise role of the

bureaucracy under the commis-

talized with insufficient com-
munication among the major of-
fices. We do not see evidence of

For all these reasons we recom-

‘portions of the industry and its

regulatory agency undergo fun-
damental changes, they will over
time totally destroy public con-
fidence and, hence, they will be

nuclear power as a viable source
of energy.

 

Commission Outlines Inadequacies In The NRC

The Kemeny commission noted that
even if the analysts read every report,
their work could not have been good
enough, because the regulators had
never taken into account the entire world
of problems connected with people
rather than machines.

It was the ‘‘people problem,”’ in fact,
that created many of the equipment pro-
blems at the Pennsylvania plant: Control

accident.”

Some of the confusion may have been
due to human failings embodied in the
design of the control room, where more
than 100 alarms lit up in the first minutes
of the accident.

A year earlier, an engineer had com-
plained about the design in a letter to his
supervisor. The Kemeny commission
would later learn that the room’s lighting

“It’s naive to think you can insure the

room engineers were trained to follow
written procedures religiously, pro-
cedures since found to be unclear.

The procedures also were most ap-
propriate for a sudden loss of cooling, re-
quiring extremely fast reactions best
performed automatically by mechanical
means. A slower-moving accident, like
the one that occurred, is more dependent
on the actions of the engineers—who
were not adequately trained to respond.

“This was the tragedy of Three Mile
Island,’ The Kemeny commission
reported, ‘“‘where the equipment failures
in the accident were significantly less
dramatic than those that had been
thoroughly analyzed, but where the
results confused those who managed the

made it difficult to see some alarms even
when they were on, and when bulbs burn-
ed out on the panel, it was impossible to
tell where the alarm was coming from.
The operator’s letter was never followed
up.
“The utility industry is by nature a
very conservative industry, particularly
where operation of the plant is concern-
ed...,"” Howard Stevens, one of the con-
trol room designers, told the commission
in explaining the layout.

Metropolitan Edison accepted the
design, he said, ‘‘simply because that it
is the way it was done before, and it
worked, and with no motivation to
change it and a risk involved in chang-
ing, they tend to stay with it.”

Thinking like that caused at least three
members of the Kemeny commission to
reconsider whether utilities should be in
the business of running nuclear plants.
Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona sug-
gested it might be better for utilities to
retain ownership of the plants but turn
over their operation to specialized ser-
vice organizations whose sole business
would be to sell nuclear expertise.

“It’s naive to think you can insure the
safety of nuclear power through regula-
tion, regulation, regulation,” Mr. Babbitt

said. “We miss the point if we don’t
recognize that utilities are the center of
gravity of the whole thing.

“T think to date there has been an
underlying assumption that any utility
that wants a license will ultimately get it.
It’s been tacitly understand that they’re
not going to be shut down. You get it and
then say good-bye.”’

Mr. Babbitt had at least limited sup-
port from fellow commissioners
Theodore B. Taylor, a physicist, and
Patrick E. Haggerty, the general direc-
tor of Texas Instruments, Inc., but the
full membership never voted on the idea
as a former recommendation.

Mr. Hendrie of the NRC would assure
commissioners that things, at least
among the regulators, are much improv-
ed. “‘It’s a different shop,” he said, com-
paring it now to March 28. Congress and
the public have ‘‘sort of been booting us
along.”’

“We should have found Three Mile
Island before it happened,’’ Mr. Hendrie
admitted. ‘“‘No question. No question. It’s
a serious failure.”

But as for the future, the NRC chair-
man, like the Kemeny commission itself,
can Say only this:

“Could I guarantee we’ll never miss
another one?

“Well,’’ he said, ‘‘I don’t like to make
guarantees.”
