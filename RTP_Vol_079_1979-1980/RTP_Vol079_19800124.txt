EC Pres. Reprimands Poole

by John G. Billmyre

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham and Junior
Representitive Bruce Poole
argued during Monday night’s
EC meeting about the role
Poole has played this year as an
ad hoc member to the Student

Control Committee, the elected _

student self-discipline body.
The argument followed
Poole’s answer to one question
and before his response to a se-
cond one from a reporter.
In response to the first ques-

_ Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Alpha Circle of Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national
leadership society founded on
the campus in 1914, initiated 26
new student members in the an-
nual ‘‘tapping’’ ceremonies
held Friday. The group includes
six third-year law students, 14
undergraduate seniors and six
undergraduate juniors.

Students are elected to OD}
by a vote of the “circlef
(chapter’s) current memife
ship, composed of studen | i
itiated in previous years, fa
ty and administrators. Crit
for election include outstand
scholarship and _ extrac\y
ricular involvement in a varia

   

vices, student government and
journalism, and the creative
and performing arts.

ODK now has circles on more
than 160 college campuses
across the nation, and induction
to the oldest chapter is regard-
ed as one of the highest honore
Washington and Lee bestows

 

upon its student leaders. Among and track teams,

tion, Poole said that he stopped
voting on Student Control Com-
mittee cases after Abraham
told the SCC ‘I don’t think that
it is proper for any ad hoc
member to vote on student com-

mittees because the EC
members are there in an ad-
visory role.”’

* Abraham made the comment
to the SCC during a brief inter-
mission in the boxwoods case.
At that time he said Poole, who

sat on the SCC last year, agreed ~

with him.

other interesting sidelights is
the fact that W&L is the home of

Yet Poole voted again after
the intermission, according to
Abraham.

The EC President reprimand-
ed Poole for his actions and said
that he mentioned the subject
only as a point of clarification;
Poole has said twice during the
EC meetings that he stopped
voting on Student Control cases
after Abraham spoke to the
committee.

This incident, fully brought to
light for the first time Monday,

apparently caused Abraham to

bring up the subject two weeks
ago.

The end result was a motion,
proposed by Jay Blumberg,
that, “‘EC members act in an
advisory capacity and not vote
in any decision.”

At that time Abraham said
there had not been any com-
plaints about EC members
voting on subcommittees, but
that the matter had come to his
attention.

Poole disagreed with
Abraham’s accusation and
said, ‘‘I’d like to see you find
somebody that would say I

_ voted after you talked to the

SCC.”

Abraham said that he would
find people to support his claim.

Poole criticized the SCC for
not notifying him about all
meetings.

“Tim Brooks has not notified
me of all meetings, but I got on
him about that,’’ said Poole.
Tim Brooks is President of the
SCC,

Poole also praised Brooks for
his leadership on the SCC say-
ing, ‘‘the meetings are well run
and the committee has handled
some tough cases.”’

Other ad hoc members to sub-
committees also _ leveled
criticism at their subcom-
mittees.

Jay Blumberg criticized the
Student Activities Board for the
way it runs its meetings.

“The meetings are run like a
circus, they are very unorganiz-
ed and there could be some im-
provement,’’ Blumberg said.

SAB Co-Chairman Bill Ridge
was on hand to defend his com-
mittee, but only seemed to
make matters worse for
himself.

Ariel Cost
Could Have
Been Halved

The Publications Board
learned last Thursday night
that the first edition of Ariel
which cost $1,450, and was
printed at the Lexington News-
Gazette, could have cost $700 if
it had been printed at the
Washington and Lee print shop.

The startling revelation was
made by former Ring-tum Phi
editor M. Gray Coleman, who
said it took him 20 minutes to
find a lower price than that
given by the News-Gazette.

“You got ripped off,”’ said
Coleman to Ariel Editor Chris
Faye.

As a result of the incident,
which was initiated by Jay
Blumberg, Senior Represen-
tative to the Executive Commit-
tee, during an EC meeting, the
Publications. Board voted to
find a business manager for the
Ariel.

Several members of the EC
who criticized the Ariel during
an EC meeting last week were
on hand to comment to the
Publications Board.

At the EC meeting earlier in
the week, Faye told that Com;
mittee the magazine was going
to cost $1,582.90, or nearly two-
thirds of the total Ariel budget.

But Faye later informed the
Publications Board and the EC
that the magazine was going to
cost $1,450.

He presented the EC with a
bill for $1,582.90, from which a
$132.90 credit had been sub-
tracted. Faye said the credit
came from the News-Gazette
because the final bill was larger
than the initial News-Gazette
estimation.

IFC News

Fijis Fined For Pledge

by Ross Newell

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council slapped
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
with over four weeks social pro-
bation for conducting fraternity
pledging activities in violation
of IFC rules.

During a meeting Monday
night, the IFC placed Fiji- on
two weeks social probation for
informal initiation rites which
violated the council’s definition
of hazing. Another two weeks
probation resulted from having
pledges at a fraternity after 8
p.m., which violates a rule
established by the IFC last
year. The incident occurred last
Thursday night, Jan. 17.

The IFC defines hazing as
“any possible activity that
might possibly cause physical
or emotional harm to pledges.’’
The rites included having the
pledges drink a mixture of
tomato juice and tabasco sauce
and asking them to climb a tree

 

General William Westmoreland

   

in front of the Fiji house to sing.
While the pledges were in the
tree, upperclassmen dumped
buckets of water on them from
the roof of the fraternity.

Syd Farrar, IFC president,
said that climbing the tree
violated hazing rules because of
the possiblility that a pledge
might fall and hurt himself.

However, Jerry L. Broccoli,
president of Fiji, emphasized to
the IFC that all of the initiation
activities were voluntary. He
said that upperclassmen ap-
plied no pressure to participate
and that some pledges decided
not to participate in certain ac-
tivities.

Under a rule implemented
last year, fraternities cannot re-
quire pledges to be at the frater-
nity house after 8 p.m. on a
school night.

Broccoli said that the
freshmen were not required to
be at the initiation ceremony
and were told to complete their

Westmoreland To Lecture
On Directions For

General William Westmore-
land will speak in Lee Chapel
Tuesday, Jan. 29 at 8 p.m. He is
the second speaker to be spon-
sored by the Contact committee
this year.

In conjunction with Contact’s
theme of “American Foreign
Policy Directions for the
1980’s,’” Gen. Westmoreland
will focus on U.S. defense
posture and the changes he sees
for the future.

A veteran of over 36 years of
military service, Gen. West-
moreland has played an active
role in every U.S. military in-
volvement from the invasion of
the Normandy beaches to Viet-

nam.

homework before they came.
He said that if he had known
about the rule, the activities
would have been scheduled to
end at 8 p.m.

The freshmen arrived at the
house about 9 p.m., Broccoli
said, and left at about 10:30.
that night.

The incident came to the
IFC’s attention when IFC
secretary Sam Perkins learned
that a freshman ‘“‘had to be at
the house” at 9 p.m. When he
arrived at the fraternity, the
pledges and upperclassmen
were leaving the front yard and
entering the house. As he was
talking to Broccoli the fresh-
men were returned to the dor-
mitories, Perkins said.

The social probation started
Tuesday and will end on Feb.
27.

Farrar also said that the Fi-
ji’s are required to participate
in a community service project.
For two Saturdays, he said,

He served as Commander of
the U.S. Military Forces in Viet-
nam as well as Army Chief of
Staff, the Army’s highest posi-
tion. He retired from military
service in 1972.

A reception for Gen. West-
moreland will be held at the
Sigma Chi fraternity house at 5
p.m. Tuesday. There will also
be a gathering following the
General’s speech in Fairfax

The ‘80s

Lounge for persons interested
in attending.

In the next few weeks, Con-
tact ‘80 will continue its sym-
posium on U.S. Foreign Rela-
tions with speeches by Robert
Evans, A CBS correspondent,
and Sen. George McGovern, a
long-standing member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee.

 

Black Activist
Stokely Carmichael
To Speak On Monday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Student Association for
Black Unity will bring noted
civil-rights leader Stokely Car-
michael to the campus Monday
(Jan. 28) for a public lecture in
Lee Chapel beginning at 8 p.m.

Carmichael, a prominent
figure in the black activist

 

movements since the early
1960’s, will offer an assessment
of social change in America
during the past decade and a
disucssion of pan-Africanism.
Admission is free for the
speech, and the public is invited
to attend.

A reception is_ tentatively
scheduled to follow the address.

 

they are to help clear a trail in
the Woods Creek park. Only 10
or 12 persons are needed each
Saturday.

In another matter, the
Judicial Board recommended
that two student involved in a
snowball fight between mem-
bers of Fiji and Pi Kappa Alpha
be dealt with by the Student
Control Committee.

The incident took place dur-
ing the first week of classes
after the Christmas holiday.
Two Fijis were throwing snow-
balls at the PiKa house, and
windows were broken.

The PiKas threw snowballs
back at them and one member,
Chris Greatwood, fired a BB
gun at the Fijis. One of the BB
pellets hit a member of Fiji in
the shoulder and he and another

2 Cars Vandalized

“I got in the car and saw
there was glass all over the
dash and the windshield was
bashed in.” Stewart Hinckley
was shocked when he came
back from a party at 4 p.m. Sun-
day to find that someone had
jumped on his 1978 Firebird and
kicked in the windshield.

The vandal struck Hinckley’s
car, parked along Lee Avenue
across from the Sigma Chi
house, at approximately 1 a.m.
A car belonging to Mike Drink-

water, parked on Washington
Street near the Graham-Lees
Dormitory, was also smashed.

Hinckley said the culprit was
wearing about a size 10 tennis
shoe (possibly Nike brand) and
had left an imprint on the hood
of the car. The same person ap-
parently did damage to both
cars.

The repairs to Hinkley’s car
will cost $115. Hinckley said he
would not press charges if the
offender turns himself in.
Drinkwater said he would also
be willing to compromise.

‘With all those people
around, somebody must have
seen who did it,’”’ Hinckley said.

Police are investigating the
incidents.

UVa Student

Arrested For

SPE House
Damage

by Richard Moss
A University of Virginia stu-
dent has been arrested and
charged in connection with a
paint-throwing incident at the
Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity
house early Sunday morning.

' The student, John E. Thorn-
ton, of Charlottesville, Va., was
arrested at 2:20 p.m. on
January 20, and charged with
giving false information to a
police officer and destroying
private property.

According to Tom Gillen, a
SPE member, the incident
began when five students came
into the house claiming that
they were members of the Rich-
mond University and Virginia
Commonwealth University SPE
chapters.

After they left the house, ‘‘one
of them threw paint on the front
door,’’ Gillen said. It was then
that SPE members “got in a
scuffle” with the other students.
“The fight was broken up when
two police cars pulled up,”
Gillen stated.

The police then took the sup-
posed Richmond U. and VCU
students, along with four SPE
members, to the police station
and charged Thornton, ac-
cording to Gillen.

EC On SAB, Contact, The Pub Board

(continued from page 1)
Blumberg toid the EC that the

SAB gets things done despite its

disorganization.

‘‘The meetings are
disorganized, there are so many
reports and committees that
often a lot of things don’t
mesh,’’ said Ridge in defense of
the SAB meetings.

But Senior Representative
Dee Keesler suggested that the
size of the SAB demanded more
organization.

‘‘What we need to get done we
do get done,”’ said Ridge, who
promised to improve .the
meetings.

Ridge also said the Ad-
ministration ‘‘screwed us’’ by
barring alumni from Fancy
Dress.

‘‘Fancy Dress is going to cost
more and we are going to have
one-third less people without
the alumni,”’ explained Ridge.

Abraham asked Ridge how
much the SAB made on Fancy
Dress last year and EC
Secretary Cove Geary said, ‘‘I
remember during debate that it
was brought up that the Fancy
Dress budget is figured up
without the alumni.”

Ridge said he thought Geary
was mistaken and estimated
the cost of Fancy Dress to be
$24-25,000. He said tickets will
cost $20 and that the SAB ex-
pected to sell approximately
1,700 tickets.

Fraser pointed out that Fancy
Dress would raise about $34,000,
a surplus of $10,000.

Junior Representative Bob
Willis asked Ridge why the SAB
did not have a sheet of paper
budgeting cost for this year’s
Fancy Dress Ball.

“It seems like before you
went in you should have a
balance sheet of how much you
are going tospend,”’ Willis said.

Ridge said he would report
back to the EC next week when

he will have all the facts and .

figures on the Ball.

Contact was also criticized by
some members who requested
that the Contact Co-chairmen
appear before the EC next week
to investigate the selection pro-
cess for members of the Contact
Committee.

The EC is acting on a letter
from a student who applied to
the Contact co-chairmen and
never got a reply.

“I think we should ask them,
(the co-chairmen) about the

selection process for the com-
mittee.”

The EC also requests in a let-
ter to the Co-chairmen, Chann-
ing Hall and Scott Cardoza, that
the two tell them the structure,
name, class, fraternity affilia-
tion and selection process for all
committee members.

Nelson Ould, Junior
Representative and ad hoc
member to Contact, questioned
the EC’s motives in the in-
vestigation. ‘‘It is as if we are
accusing them of favoritism,”
said Ould

Ould also made a suggestion,
with Senior Representative Dee
Keesler, that ‘‘Contact take a
student poll before it contacted
speakers.”’

“It concerns me that maybe
the chairmen make too many
decisions about speakers,”’ said
Ould.

The EC also discussed Con-
tact’s scheduling of speakers.
Professor Gunn, according to
Sophomore Representative,
Jim Wenke, ‘‘was concerned
that Contact was booking peo-
ple before checking the calen-
dar.”

Wenke said Gunn gave the
glut of speakers appearing on
campus and speaking on the
same topic last week as an ex-
ample.

“T don’t think that it is
anybody’s fault but Mr. Gunn’s
because he doesn’t call
meetings,’’ Dee Keesler said.

Ould explained that affairs of
interest come up suddenly, such
as the Afghanistan and Iranian
crises, and that Contact is try-
ing to include these affairs in a
coherent program.

Before discussion of Contact
was over, Fraser suggested
that Contact should establish a
list of priorities for speakers,
selecting speakers as they go
down the list.

The Publications Board also
drew fire from the EC.
Blumberg, Fraser and Poole
accused Pub Board President
Ben Keesee of trying to close
the last meeting, which dealt
with Ariel, before discussion
from the public was heard.

“What really bothered me
was that Ben tried to close out
the meeting before people made
comments,”’ said Poole. He ad-
ded that Keesee made people
‘feel like outsiders and that
their opinion was not wanted.”’

|

Poole also criticized Keesee
for holding the meeting in the
Cockpit.

Cove Geary defended
Keesee’s holding the meeting in
the Cockpit.

“This was the first time since
the Gallagher Lampoon issue
there was a reason to hold a pub

board meeting outside the
Cocknit ”’

Vyeapae.
=

Keesee, who attended the
meeting after the accusations
were made said, ‘There was
not an attempt to hide anything
from anybody; I wanted to
close it so the Secretary would
not have to record the conversa-
tion.”

Blumberg suggested that
Keesee model his committee

after the EC.

SS ee ee oe a

“If there was ever a commit-
tee which you should model
your meeting, it is this commit-
tee,’ said Blumberg. “It is a
better procedure to leave a
meeting open to entertain mo-
tions.”

The EC commended Jim
Vines for the job he has done
this year on the Cold Check

Committee

Fleetwood Mac & Pink Floyd

Artists Cut Double Albums

by Mark Kinniburg
The new year brings many
new albums and artists, and
behind each and everyone there
is a record company with a
great financial investment.

Unfortunately for the record
companies, record sales are at
a low that has been witnessed
- for the past year with only
slight deviations for The
Eagles, Doobie Brothers, and
Led Zeppelin.

Some artists have actually
been forced out of the record
business because of poor sales,
including Ace, Jesse Colin
Young, Peter Frampton, and
many smaller, lesser known ar-
tists, not to mention the literally
thousands of artists signed for a
single 45 r.p.m. release.

There are those, outside of the
losers, who are selling records
at a breakneck pace, and prob-
ably would if their albums were
even more expensive that the
$8.98 list price.

Pink Floyd’s latest, ‘The
Wall” and Fleetwood Mac’s
“Tusk” are two examples of
double album sets which are
and have been at the top of
retail movers since before
Christmas.

Pink Floyd has been produc-
ing quality experimental rock
for nearly a decade, and besides
their well known ‘‘Money,”’ they
have yet to go commercial.
“The Wall” is obviously not
meant as a sell-out to their
many fans from their other cult
albums, but it seems that there
is a more accessable mix on this
effort. The killer on this album
set is “Another brick in the
wall” a trilogy spaced through-
out the four sides with the
recurring refrain—‘‘We don’t
need no education...all in all

you’re just another brick in the
wall.”’ Along with Roger
Water’s social commentary we
see a musical side of Pink Floyd
mixed with technical ad-
vancements usually avoided by
less adventuresome recording
artists. Actually, new techni-
ques of master disc alteration
which didn’t even exist two
years ago, such as analog
delay, parametric equalization,
and oral ring modulation, are
all present on ‘The Wall.’’ The
result of the advanced tech-
nology and excellent songwrit-
ing talent produces an album
which is listenable and bound to
be a classic. Although introduc-
ed at a steep list price of $14.98,
“The Wall” is available through
discount record stores for a few
dollars less, and I’ll add it’s
worth it.

Fleetwood Mac needed a
followup for ‘Rumours’ with
the same potential for platinum
sales and airplay. The - two
record set of ‘‘Tusk” has proven
to be a powerful followup in
every sense despite the $15.98
retail price. Since last year’s
release, ‘“‘Tusk’’ has produced
no fewer than four top 40 singles
including “Tusk” and “Sara,”
with many more on the way for
the spring, summer and fall.
‘‘Tusk’”’ lacks all the lyrical
sophistication of Pink Floyd
and the album could have been
the outtakes of the recording
sessions of their first two
albums.

I quess what bothers me the
most about “‘Tusk”’ is it seems
geared to sell and produce more
revenue through singles
releases, based largely on the
reputation of Fleetwood Mac.
Sure, there are some good tunes
and some possible killers, but
nothing that couldn’t have fit in-
to a single album package. Not
surprisingly, as Warner

Pub Board Meeting

(continued from page 1)

At the Publications Board
meeting EC President Steve
Abraham criticized Faye’s
handling of funds and said,
“This off-the-wall figure is ir-
responsible to the student
body.’’

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg attacked Faye’s
handling of the Ariel and said,
“When the Publications Board

picks an editor, he should use
his money wisely.”’

Blumberg recommended the
Publications Board select a new
editor for the Ariel.

During Monday night’s EC
meeting Abraham said, “‘It
flabbergasts me that you came
in here and gave us a wrong
figure.”’

Faye apologized for the
mistake and said that it will not
happen again.

IFC Discusses Fight

(continued from page 2)

Fiji went into the PiKa house to
find the person firing the gun.

A fight ensued involving the
two Fijis and six or eight PiKas.
The PiKas involved said they
were trying to make the Fijis
leave the house.

The two Fijis then returned to
their fraternity and recruited
approximately 20 brothers to go
with them to the PiKa house.

Shortly after the Fijis reach-
ed the PiKa house, the police ar-
rived, answering a call from
PiKa Tom Goss. He said he had
received word that a group of
Fijis were on their way to the
PiKa house.

The police were called to stop
a possible fight between the Fi-
jis and the PiKas, Goss said.

Tensions eased when the police
arrived.

Farrar said that a fight never
broke out between the two
groups and therefore the inci-
dent was not within the jurisdic-
tion of the IFC. The incident
primarily involved two in-
dividuals, Farrar said, and thus
it was a matter for Student Con-
trol to handle.

In other business, Farrar said
the Judicial Board is in-
vestigating the funding of
Wednesday. night parties that
have been held this semester.

“We are investigating the
funding in general and two
cases in particular,” Farrar
said. He would not say which
two cases were receiving closer
scrutiny.

Dash’s Picks For °79

Now that everybody else has come out with a
“Ten Best’ list of movies for 1979 (except for
Time magazine, which had a ‘‘Best of the Decade”’
list), I thought that I would list what I thought
were the ten best of the year.

My problem in listing them is that I haven’t seen
all the movies of the year that I’d like to have seen,
thus I thought I’d list five I wish I had seen, and
then five I have seen:

The Five Movies of 1979 I Wish I Had Seen:

Eraserhead by David Lynch—Lynch’s first
feature film is ‘“‘A dream of dark and troubling
things’’ and a punk-cult film already.

Despair by Ranier Werner Fassbinder—is a
decadent comedy adopted from Nabokov. I was in-
vited to the Chicago premier (Fassbinder was
there!) but I had to give my pass to a chum
because I was in Big Lex (GAAHHH!).

Rock and Roll High School by Allan Arkush—
stared Chuck Berry and The Ramones and has in-
cited people to yell, ‘I don’t wanna be a pin-head
no more!”’ Very punk (i.e. artistic).

Peppermint Soda by Diane Kurys—another
premier film for the director; Kurys is a protege
of Truffaut. The film is about an adolecent girl
making the transition into womanhood.

Escape From Alcatraz by Don Seigel—is not
just another Clint Eastwood film. It is, rather, a
low-key film noir; showing what a powerful genre
this is.

At last, The Five Best Films of 1979.

1) Dawn Of The Dead by George Romero—the
superior sequel to the classic Night Of The Living
Dead. This is both the most horrible film ever pro-

duced (more gore than ever before! ) anda serious
film asking questions about the nature of humani-
ty.

2) Saint Jack by Peter Bogdonavitch—a power-
fully subtle movie by a master craftsman. This is
about honor and decency in the demi-monde of
Singapore. Jack (Ben Gazara) is a pimp cor-
rupted by forces greater than himself. This movie
manipulates the audience like no other.

2) Fedora by Billy Wilder—is the artistic sequel
to Sunset Boulevard. This is the story of a
Garbo/Crawford-esque movie actress whose life
is shrouded in mystery. An excellent reflection on
the previous film and on the whole of Wilder’s
(and to a lesser extent his fellow German, Lang’s)
career.

3) The Marriage of Maria Brun by Ranier
Werner Fassbinder—is the second film of the year
by the prolific Fassbinder. This is a political
analogy between the war bride Maria and Ger-
many after the war. The film is incredibly rich on
all levels.

4) Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola—
the year’s spectacle. Flawed in many places, but
too powerful to be forgotten. (Oh, and thanks,
Flamer. )

5) Kramer vs. Kramer by Robert Benton—this
film belongs to its excellent cast. Someone will
probably re-write this inevitable film of the seven-
ties and put it on T.V., but the acting by Meryl
Streep, Dustin Hoffman, and Jane Alexander is
faultless. The intensity of the characters as they
portray them is astounding.

The No.1
Debate

 

 

Look out fans, but here we go again. Just as the
debate over who was No. 1 in college football seemed
to be dying down, the same question has popped up in
college basketball circles.

With a 16-0 record, DePaul has earned the top spot

in both polls for the second straight week. However,

DePaul is not the dominant team that a top ranking
implies.

Sure, they have a perfect record, a sentimental
favorite in Ray Meyer and an electrifying player in
Mark Aguirre, but they aren’t the best.

Let’s face it. No team in the country can claim to be
supreme over all others. A look at some of the top
challengers should prove my point.

Case No. 1: DePaul has the only perfect record, but
only on last Sunday did they play a team that has been
a legitimate national contender (LSU). A good per-
formance against Notre Dame would merit DePaul
the top spot.

Case No. 2: Oregon State will now claim it should be
No. 1. I have only two questions for the Beavers: (1)
where is Oregon State? and (2) who have they
played? (Besides U.C.L.A.).

' Case No. 3: Duke continues to be the season’s biggest
enigma. Sometimes the Blue Devils are unstoppable
and sometimes they look like a coach’s nightmare.
Take ro its ACC games and Duke has a perfect
record.

Case No; 4: Kentucky is likewise a team of mystery.
The Wildcats beat Notre Dame without three of their
best players and then got dumped by Alabama and
Tennessee. For the time being, UK will have to forget
about national prominence and try to win its con-
ference.

Case No. 5: Syracuse’s claim to fame was beating
Purdue at Purdue. Unfortunately for the Orangemen,
one game does not a ranking make. For every Purdue
on Syracuse’s schedule, you can find the likes of
Canisius, LeMoine and St. Francis.

Case No. 6: Notre Dame will be in serious trouble if it
has to face any more quick teams. Losses to Kentucky
and San Francisco prove this fact. If the Irish had
more team speed and more depth, they could win it
all. However, these are big “‘ifs’’.

Case No. 7: Louisville has been quietly closing in on
the top spot with each new poll. The team responsible
for “The Doctors of Dunk”’ and ‘Dr. Dunkenstein’’
has loads of talent, but it is hampered by playing a
nearly anonymous schedule. The Cardinals are

notorious for choking in the playoffs — and will pro- -

bably do the same this year.

So now you have seven of the best teams in the na-
tion. Instead of making a prediction as to who will win
it all, I’ll leave that thought with you. After the bids
have been passed out and the regional brackets have
been set up, then, maybe, a favorite can be establish-
ed.

Until that time, your guess is as good as mine.

Cagers Spend Week In
Midst Of Losing Skein

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee
basketball team continued to
struggle through the toughest
part of its season last week, as
the Generals dropped a pair of
games and watched their

_ record slip to 5-8.

The combined losing margin
for both games was only twelve
points, however.

Against Eastern Mennonite
last Thursday night, W&L fell
behind early due to hot shooting
by Mennonite. The Generals
trailed 30-40 at the half, yet
were able to cut the margin to
three midway through the sec-
ond half. That was as close as
the Generals were to come.

“Mennonite was really up for
us and we were not ready to
play,”’ said head coach Verne
Canfield. ‘‘We may still have
been emotionally spent from
the Hampden-Sydney game.”

Freshman forward Brian
Hanson had a big game against
Mennonite, scoring 17 points
and grabbing six rebounds.
Junior R.J. Seaggs added
eleven points and six rebounds,
and sophomore guard George
Spears chipped in eleven points.

Although the starting five’s
scoring was balanced, the out-
puts of both senior forward Tom
Jeffries and junior center Rob
Smitherman ‘fell to nine and
eight points, respectively.

The Generals got a big lift
from their bench as sophomore
Clark New scored 14 points and
snared seven rebounds. Sopho-
more forward Travis Patterson
tacked on the remaining seven
points from the bench, yet these
efforts were not enough as the
Generals ended up on the short
end of the score, 84-77.

The key to the Generals’ prob-
lems has been their inconsisten-
cy on defense. Against Men-
nonite, W&L allowed two
players to each score over twen-
ty points.

Similarly, in W&L’s 85-80 loss
to Lynchburg last Saturday, the
problem remained the same—
defense. After trailing by only
three points at the half, the
Generals were outscored 13-5 in

 

Clark New (above) and George
Spears are now the starting
guards;

 

a quick, three minute burst by
Lynchburg.

‘‘What we need to establish is
more overall consistency, stop-
ping the bad stretches that hurt
us in the end,” said Canfield.

Lynchburg maintained a dis-

tance of no more than thirteen

points but no less than ten,
stretching their lead to 76-66
with 6:30 left in the game. The
worst news for the Generals

was Lynchburg’s incredible
86% field goal shooting in the
second half.

Yet a W&L squad that could
have settled for trying to stay
close mounted an incredible
comeback in the last six
minutes of the game; a come-
back that fell just short.

New, who played a big part in
keeping the Generals close for
the better part of the second
half, scored five of his team-
high 18 points in the last six
minutes. Jeffries collected five
of his 16 points during this
stretch and the Lynchburg lead
melted to three points with just
:30 remaining.

As time ran down, W&L was
forced to foul Lynchburg’s
dead-eye guard Scott Huffman,
who‘canned all four free throw
opportunities to put the game
out of reach. Both Huffman and
the Hornet’s All-Conference
center E.D. Schechterly netted
27 points apiece.

Again, a two-man combina-
tion was able to hit for at least
40 points against the Generals.
W&L’s own scoring, in addition
to New and Jeffries, was very
well balanced; Spears had 13,
Smitherman collected 14 and
Patterson scored 10.

“Our bad stretches are
becoming less now, and the play
of Clark New and Travis Patter-
son are really positive signs,”
said Canfield. ‘“‘The kids musn’t
worry about past mistakes but
what is ahead of them.”’

In a game played last night,
the Generals faced Gettysburg,
a team which, according to Can-
field, ‘has been playing good
ball, winning their last five
games. Yet the point is not what
they will be able to do to us, but
what we can do to beat them.”

Grapplers Split In Tourney;
Host Invitational This Sat.

by Chris Sisto

Last week the Washington &
Lee wrestling team posted a 1-1
mark in dual meet play and had
a disappointing appearance in
the Citadel Tournament.

At the tournament the
Generals had only four victories
and a loss that could prove cost-
ly for the remainder of the
season. Two of the victories
came from team captain Ray
Gross, who finished second in
the 142 pound weight class. He
lost in the finals 8-5. The other
wins came from seniors Ed
Rogers at 167 lbs. and Mike
Deighan at 150 lbs.

What was more important
however, was the injury to
sophomore Mike McFadden. He
suffered a leg injury in his first
match at the tournament and
according to Head Coach Gary
Franke he could be out from one
week to the rest of the season.
Last year McFadden was
ODAC champion at 150 lbs. and

won the Generals’ Outstanding
Freshman Wrestler award.

Franke said about the tourna-
ment he felt his team didn’t do
as well as he had expected, say-
ing the team ‘‘had made some
mistakes.”

Earlier in the week the
Generals lost to Glassboro State
32-13, and successfully defend
their ODAC crown with a win
over Hampden-Sydney 30-25.

Winners against H-S were Scott
Lindsey (126), Gross (142),
Rogers (167) and Joe Wallace
(heavyweight). Against
Glassboro only Gross, McFad-
den, and Rogers were winners.
The team will try to improve
upon their 2-5 record with a
match against ODAC opponent
Lynchburg College tonight and
then hosts the Washington &
Lee Invitational Tournament

Saturday.

by Ed Brown

| As the candidates begin to put their campaigns
in high gear for the first round of caucuses and
primaries, the Republican Party as a whole is
beginning its assault on the Carter administration.
January 14th and 15th saw the first in a series of
Republican platform hearings held by the
Republican National Committee. The hearings,
described by R.N.C. Chairman Bill Brock as the
‘most comprehensive and open platform develop-
ment process ever attempted by’ either party,”
were held in Washington, D.C. A number of ex-
perts in a wide variety of fields testified as to their
recommendations for the Republican platform.
Nine more open hearings will be held in various
cities around the country over the next five
months. :

Chaired by Senator John Tower of Texas, the
Resolutions Committee included Washington and
Lee graduates Brock, a former Senator from Ten-
nessee, and Senator John Warner of Virginia. Both
Brock and Warner will be on hand for the May 9th
and 10th Mock Convention with Brock delivering
opening remarks and Senator Warner serving as
Parade Marshal.

Never far from the political scene, W&L’s Mock
Convention was well represented at the hearings.
Tri-Chairmen Dick Schoenfeld, Craig Cornett and
Sidney Simmons along with Platform Chairman
Ed Brown spent two days listening to the
testimony of the witnesses that included Senators
Jacob Javits of New York and Larry Pressler of
South Dakota, Carla Hills, former Secretary of
H.U.D., former Senator James Buckley, Con-
gressman Jack Kemp of New York and Governor
Pete du Pont of Delaware. ;

Javits led off the testimony with an explosive
call for an expanded NATO alliance. Echoed by
others throughout the two days, Javits urged the
Committee to adopt a platform plank increasing

the US. and western presence in the volital area

Chairmen Attend Platform Hearings

of the mid-east and south Asia. The plan would re-
quire an effort to securc the free passage of oil
through the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean and the
Persian Gulf. In addition, the NATO allies would
agree to bring the oil fields of the area within their
defense perimeter. In the same vein, numerous
witnesses saw a need for increasing the ability of
the intelligence community to perform their func-
tion by repealing what they feel to be overly
restrictive legislation and allowing the agencies to
conduct their affairs with a lesser amount of con-
gressional intervention, while mainting executive
oversight to protect against abuses of power.

The hearings saw the traditional Republican
values of more free enterprise and less govern-
ment. This concept, as stated by Hills of a “‘decen-
tralization of decision-making away from
Washington toward the people,” was a theme
often repeated. While most speakers seized the op-
portunity to take a preemptory potshot at the
Carter administration and the Democrats at
large, it was seen that this was not the sole func-
tion of the hearings. Representative Kemp was
adamant on this point. ‘‘We must first advance
positive solutions which repair the damage done
by the Democratic Party” were the words of the
New York Congressman.

As with the Republican Party, the Mock Conven-
tion has gotten off to an early start in forming the
1980 Mock Convention platform. It is the hope of
the Platform Committee to prepare drafts of the
platform prior to the convention and to hold open
hearings on campus as well as at other schools in
the area to allow input on the controversial issues
that will be taken up in this year platform.
Although often overlooked and ignored by the
nominee, it is the belief of Republicaneaders that
“The lines are clearly drawn between the two par-
ties’’ in the words of Chairman Brock, and that the
platform will gain new significance in the general

EC Will Not Pay

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously not to pay
the City of Lexington for
damages done to a_ police
cruiser on the night of the Ira-
nian rally.

Action on the matter was tabl-
ed during a meeting two weeks
ago when the EC decided not to
take action until it had more in-
formation about the city’s in-
surance on the automobile.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Steve Abraham talked
with Chief of Police James A.
Kirby, who notified the Univer-
sity that he wanted the school to
pay for the damages.

Kirby told Abraham that he
talked to Dean of Students Louis
G. John on the night of the rally
and quoted John as saying,
“We'll take care of any
damages done to the car.”’

Abraham said he did not
know that John had already told
Kirby that the University would
pay for repairs. The EC Presi-
dent said that he still did not
think that the EC should pay for
the damage and the EC then
voted unanimously not to pay

for the repairs.

However, the EC also left the
door open for restitution to the

For Damage To Car

city should there be any more
information indicating that it
should pay the city.

Junior Representative Jay
Blumberg restated the argu-
ment against paying the city
that John Fraser, Senior Law
Representative, made two
weeks ago.

Fraser said, ‘I don’t want to
start a precedent where
everytime a W&L student goes
downtown and raises hell the
University has to pay for it.’’

ODK Speaker

Korry Paints Grim
Picture For Future

by Alan Kendrick

‘“‘A generation symbolized by
three little words, ME, MORE,
and NOW. Americans did not
want to be drawn into messy
foreign situations. We wanted a
muting of idsological and par-
tisan passions, were far more
dedicated to consumption than
to savings and investment, far
more cynical about politicians
and parties, and far more
devoted to the exploration of
one’s self.’’ This is the descrip-
tion W&L alumnus Ambassador
Edward M. Korry gave of this
country as he outlined the re-
cent developments in Iran and
Afghanistan at the ODK
assembly Friday.

“So we have a government,”
said Korry, “which mirrored
this mood and these priorities.
The President announced that
the era of foreign policy built on
fear of the Soviet Union and
Communism had ended — the
U.S. would substitute moral ex-
ample and human rights for
overseas involvement. No one’s
lifestyle would be upset — there
would be no wrenching changes
to deal with the energy crunch
— no sacrifice to maintain the
dollar as the foundation of the

MMA

global economic system — no
annoying tax increases for
weapons and troops for the
perilous game of Balance of
Power. Instead, the Soviet
Union would play by our rules.”’

Of the Ethiopian crisis, Korry
said, ‘“‘We acted as if nothing
had changed.” Korry, former
ambassador to Ethiopia, said
that the all-out Soviet committ-
ment to that country in 1977
greatly explains the current in-
ternational developments:

“When the Afghan govern-
ment was overthrown in 1978,
for example, the State Depart-
ment and the New York Times
promptly emphasized to us that
there was no evidence of Soviet
involvement,. no basis for
believing the new regime in
Kabul would be aligned to
Moscow, no cause for concern.

“Again, when the Soviets
dumped Somalia for its larger
neighbor, Ethiopia, the White
House and the Times informed
us that the Somalis, in fact, had
dumped the Soviets; the Rus-
sians, we were told. would soon
find themselves mired in
Ethiopia, too.”

“The Carter  administation
changed no policy in response to
the Soviets actions in Ethiopia;
it avoided any alarm which
might jeopardize the SALT
treaty and the central dialogue

‘ the power

with the Russians. Instead, we

dispatched an ambassador to.

Addis and we renewed our ef-
forts to persuade the Arabs and
Isrealis to meet with the Rus-
sians and us to establish peace
in the Middle East.”

Korry stressed that decision-
making errors were often at
fault, “It is mot only in
authoritarian governments that
of decsion is
obscured, but also in the murky
processes of our divided
democracy,”’ as he quoted Sen.
Moynihan. Korry attributed
much of the problem with Iran
to these faults in decision-
making. “First, we tried to
reassure the Sheiks and the
Ayatollahs of our good inten-

* tions by opening an under-the-

table dialogue with the Palesti-
nian Liberation Organization.
Then, we reversed direction.
The White House ignored the
strongest warnings from our
top diplomat in Teheran not to
admit the Shah. And when we
did, Khomeni reacted as ex-
plosively as our Embassy had
forewarned. He applauded the
hostagetaking because it
dramatized his cultural
counterrevolution. The Shah

circumstances similar to the
overthrow of the Czars...a
period of rapid, belated in-
dustrialization...the whole tur-
bulent process called socializa-
tion.”’

Three goals of U.S. policy
coincided with the dethrowned

_ Shah’s objectives, according to

Korry, and these were:’’1)
Tokeep the Russians out of Iran
— and out of the entire Persian
Gulf area. 2) To keep oil flowing
to the West and to Japan. 3) To
keep Isreal independent and
secure. These three pillars of
U.S. policy in the Mid-east,”
said Korry, collapsed with the
Shah, yet they did not provoke
any major shift in our foreign
policy...nor did they halt the
politics-as-usual at home.”

In regard to Afghanistan,
Korry said, ‘“‘The Soviets don’t
like failures either, particularly
in a sensitive place such as a
neighboring country. The fiasco
of its own puppet would be
motive enough for the Kremlin

into a longer term vertue.”’
Korry gave six major reasons
for the Soviet invasion: ‘‘1)
There would be little effective
resistance. 2) The U.S. was not
ready to stop or interfere. In-
deed, just before the Politburo
gave the green light to its tanks,
Washington was hoping to enlist
Moscow in its political push to

free the hostages in Iran...and
one argument we emphasized
was our determination to avoid
force if at all possible. 3) The
thrust gives Russia a weighty
influence over Iran’s future. 4)
The Soviets are now installed on
Afghan airfields only 350 miles
from the Persian Gulf — poised
to ‘protect Iran.” 5) The
Soviets can now lean more
heavily against China and its al-
ly Pakistan. These Asians are,
of course, very concerned. zbu
But only 72 hours ago, President
Zia of Pakistan stated the
lesson of Afghanistan plainly:

‘You cannot live in the sea
and creat the enmity of whales;
you have to be friendly with
them. The Soviet Union is on
our doorstep. The U.S. is 10,000
miles away...’

That’s the sort of prudence
many governments will share.
6) The Soviets are well-
positioned to profit in the most
critical area of all-the Middle
East...from the festering
cancer which sickens our rela-
tions with the Arab states...the
unsettled situation of Isreal and
the Palestinians.

“If the U.S, does not now app-
ly its full weight, election year
or not...if it does not risk, does
not expend, whatever is
necessary to push the parties
toward a final settlement, the
Kremlin will certainly add to its
ascendancy.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Dancing The Night Away

Last year at this time there were cynics among us
who felt that the W&L community was not conducive
to a massive fund-raising effort. Everyone knew that
the W&L student was self-centered and egotistical,
and would only cooperate in activities that would
enhance his hedonist seekings. Not enough people
seemed up for the event—it was just something to
drop by if nothing else was going on. How wrong we
were! Our first dance marathon netted about $10 per
student enrolled, the highest per capita yield in
Virginia. Our neighbors at Virginia Tech set for their
goal a dollar per student, and they had been having
dance marathons for quite some time. Everyone
deserved a slap on the back for the effort, from the
dancers to the drinkers to the administrators.

This year there are more than three times as many
students registered to dance as last year and more
are coming in. But we cannot be lured into false
security by last year’s success. We need particiaption
more than ever, in workers, dancers, and revelers.
This is one of our ‘Big Weekends” and we can only
make it work if we all contribute something. So often
charity efforts are merely the signing of a check or
the attending of some grueling sports event. Here’s a
chance to get something out of the giving—a damn
good party and a lot of fun.

Our Threatened
Traditions

Can the W&L gentleman survive the gas crisis?
Changes that occured over Christmas break have
made several of the more serious minded among us
consider the grim picture before us. We fondly
remember our freshman year road trips, usually
made in lieu of the Wednesday night parties, when we

Musings On Current Events

John Connaliy-believes that staying awake for 40
hours will show that he is the best man for the
presidency. The Carter Administration believes
that the best interests of our democratic republic
are served by throwing money at a bizarre-looking
politically unstable despot in Pakistan. Teddy
Kennedy is able to divert questions about his

 
 
 
 
 
 

swimming ability by having his ex-aiconolic wife
say that she believes his stories. °

Because of the mass media, and its ‘‘predic-
tions,”’ a candidate can lose a primary and still be
a winner. Tens of millions of people actually
believe that Jimmy the Greek, Jane Kennedy,
Brent Munsburger, and Irv Cross know their col-
lective digestive systems from a hole in the
ground. Some poor people are so desperate for
entertainment that they actually watch more than
the last five minutes of any basketball game.

Roone Arledge is the head of a national net-
work’s news department. Barbara Walters gets a
million dollars a year. Jane Fonda believes that

Y someone takes her seriously. California is still in

the union, despite such contributions as George
Allen, roller disco, Jerry Brown, Richard Nixon,

drive circle we are familiar with. Now we debate who

shall drive by considering the issue of who has the =

smallest car rather than the biggest; instead of roll-
ing-until the beer runs out we plan to go to the closest
school and no further. The infirmary is plagued with
an epidemic of fanny fatigue cases as six are piled in-
toa Toyota rather than a suburbanite ‘‘lead sled.”’

Now we wince at the sound of our own voices admit-
ting that gas at $1.06 isn’t bad. But the energy crisis
has now hit below the belt, beyond the gas tank and in-
to the fraternity social program. Reports are that
Virginia’s grain alchohol, which we all know is made
for drinking and not for burning, is now going into
gasahol and then automobiles rather than into big
jugs and then garbage cans. We may now be incited to
drive less so that perhaps our children can enjoy the
bliss of trudging to ‘“‘A’’-hour classes with their
mouths still red and their faces green. One of the
wealthier fraternities has started a ‘‘grain cellar”’
with the finest spirits bottled, labeled by vintage, and
stored securely away for future generations or ar-
cheologists. (What a find for The Dig in 200 years! )

Rush candidates will be judged, we suspect, by who
holds a gas credit card, and the popular girls will be
those who use ‘‘plastic Daddy”’ on the tank rather
than the clothes. The effects will be felt in the admis-
sions office and studied in the sociology department.
And when we are old and gray, with quivering voice
we can relate to our open-mouthed successors the stir
in the heart we felt at the cry of ‘‘Road trip to
Hollins !’’—a sound that will only be an echo of a by-
- gone culture.

To the student body of
Hampden-Sydney, on behalf of
the basketball team, I would
simply like to express apprecia-
tion for the support Tuesday
night during the Washington
and Lee game.

Your enthusiasm made the
game into the truly exciting
event that it should be. Your
presence makes all the dif-
ference in the world and instills
a spirit too often lacking here.

Keep your eyes on the sched-
ule—we have some excellent
contests coming up and an
ODAC tournament to win in
February.

Keep it up,

Ariel. Different things to different people. Dif-
ferent things to different editors. Chris Fay’s Ariel
is nothing if not different.

Before I get to the meat of my argument, I
would like to applaud Fay for his inclusion of art-
work in Ariel. In particular the works of Drayton
Smith are a welcome addition to a magazine too
long dominated by photography.

Ariel, Vol. XVIII, No. 1 certainly has a different
feel than most Ariel’s I’ve read. Rather than a col-

 

Parker Potter is a 1979 graduate of Washington and
Lee University and a former editor of Ariel.

 

lection of specific pieces whose only commonality
is being printed between the same covers, Fay’s
Ariel presents a number of pieces which work
together to pose a number of interrelated ques-
tions.

Put simply, the magazine asks whether art is a
public or private act and whether the goal of art is
to entertain or to challenge its audience. My feel-
ing is that Ariel is indeed challenging if not enter-
taining, instructive if not delightful. And for me,
the challenge of Ariel is making my own some of
the intensely private or at least foreign expres-
sions in it. (By “‘making my own” I am referring
to the process by which we all come to understand
a work of art—in whatever way we need to. )

Perhaps what I’m trying to say (what I need to
say) is that Ariel is a totally honest attempt by
Fay and his staff to present one vision/version of
literature. And for the record, while some of what
happens in Ariel seems a bit on the fringe, there is
nothing going on in it that isn’t pretty old hat to
any moderately knowledgable reader of modern
poetry. But on to the heart of the issue, which is
the issue.

Like any literary magazine, Ariel has its high
points and low points, and in between, many points
to be made.

One high point is Hike Moore’s story “The
Orange-Tinted Window.” I admire its well-
craftedness. The dialogue is consistent and it
works. Even more noteworthy is Moore’s atten-
tion to detail and his ability to manipulate the
details of the actual world through the mind of the
oldman, .

Finally, though, it is Moore’s ability to translate
the old man’s thoughts into words and actions in

contemplation.

Jim Leva’s story (a fragment extracted from
another longer work) is pure Leva. It is notable for
his usual sophisticated wordplay and generally
provocative use of language. And the premise of
this little chunk of story is clever but not cute—
delightfully wry.

It is good to know that Palmore Clark is alive
and well. With his rather unusual style he is able to
pack together quite a few insightful moments and
even string them together but maybe just maybe
some of his keen observations and feelings might
do better each in its own pot with its own little soil
and not all brambled and bristled together but who
am I tosay to say to say...

Dash’’s story, ‘‘Lucid,” is another of Ariel’s fic-
tions. If we can untangle Dash’s fiction from the
fiction of Dash I think its a whole lot easier to deal
with ‘‘Lucid.’’ What Dash does he does well. He
needs few words to vividly splash colors onto the
surface of the weird little world of his story.

I feel compelled to speak up about the infamous
phone booth scene. Well—things like that do hap-
pen, I suppose. And the scene is certainly germain
to the story, and—strange though it may be—a
story which works. Enough moral mountains
made of artful ant hills.

Much of what is left of Ariel, for me at least,
doesn’t work. Tom Baker’s ‘6:00 P.M. at the
Local A&P” has a narration problem. Neither nar-
rative nor essay, this story struggles to find a tone
and in doing so deep-sixes everything but its easy
moralism.

As for ‘‘Maggie’’ by Kitt Donne—I’m not real
sure what it’s trying to do, so I’ve got no idea
whether or not it does it well.

And my problems with “Maggie” and ‘“A&P”’
are as good as gloss as any for the generally
perceived problems with the rest of Ariel. Obvious-
ly Baker and Donne have some clear idea of what
their stories do. They are no doubt successful as
private acts. They just haven’t become successful
public acts.

“The Vantage Point,” ‘“‘Anyone Home,” ‘‘Loch
Ness Likeness,”’ and Ed Bloomquist’s piece all
mean something to the person who put them in
Ariel. And to the person who made them. These
along with Katherine Reiche’s, Chip McFeeter’s,
and Geof Bain’s are all intensely personal works.

“If it is trash at four bucks a pop

it would be trash for a quarter.”

 

the real world which is most arresting and most
praiseworthy in the story.

I also like very much Dan Weeks’ “‘Improvisa-
tions in Cool.’’ These six small poems all use
their sound to underline their meaning. The slight-
ly muted, slippery twisting of ‘sensual smoke
rings” does what a saxophone does. And ‘‘the deep
darkness of night’’ has the measured beat of a
thumping bass line.

As well, Weeks’ deserves credit for the deft un-
forced way in which he uses so much visual im-
agery to make us hear the instruments in his jazz
club.

There is much to be admired in Phil Welch’s
long poem. Welch states the central dilemma of
the poem clearly, early on, then allows the poem
to go on about its business. And in doing that
business the poem repeatedly returns to its cen-
tral thesis—that war, while a creation of man, has
grown out of control, like some Frankenstein’s

monster, bigger than life, somehow no longer

comprehensible.

The tone and diction of the poem are generally
very well controlled. Welch can talk of something
“whose origin precedes history...beginning
beyond beginning and ending beyond end”’ and not
have the brittle, stilted sound of something written
by a horn-rimmed high school freshman who just
read his first philosophy book. Welch’s is a good
poem with many fine moments.

Among the other poetry, I find both Andrew
Trotter’s short pieces and Brett Lovejoy’s ‘‘Por-
trait: Hatteras Solitude’ to be unpretentious and
effective, in a word-appealing. They are
understated yet complete, suggesting to the
reader further avenues of interesting and pleasant

The question we face is whether poetry can be
anything other than personal, not whether is
should be or must be. These poems suggest that
the meaningfulness of a poem to a reader is pure
happenstance, a fortuitous accident.

Certainly these poems challenge the reader. Be-
ing faced by a blank page is an uncomfortable
thing. And being shown something like ‘Anyone
Home,”’ as personal as that poem is, can be pretty
unnerving. (Who can say whether or not it’s
trash—it’s somebody’s damn notebook—you
should see what I’ve got in mine—).

But is it the goal of art to be comfortable—to ex-
ist for the audience? I don’t know. Nobody knows.

There are things in Ariel I can’t write about.
Things I’ve not yet made my own. But that’s o.k.
And Fay’s certainly isn’t like any Ariel I’d put out.
But that’s o.k., too. There are some things in Ariel
I wouldn’t blow my nose on. Finally, that too is o.k.

Perhaps Fay hasn’t pleased his audience or
even been very conscious of it. His Ariel has been
much read and much discussed. That’s good. A
number of people are pretty damn sure they know
what they don’t like in Ariel. Good. That can help
them know all the better what they do like.

I’ve probably raised more questions than I’ve
answered here. Fay’s probably isn’t an Ariel very
many of us would put out ourselves. But not very
many of us were asked to put one out.

If it is trash at four bucks a pop it would be trash
for a quarter. And if we were ripped off or
mismanaged, the sin would be just as great if the
thing was to win a Pulitzer Prize.

Letter To The Editor
EC Should Not Have

Criticized Magazine

Dear Sir,

In reference to the E.C. com-
ments on the Ariel, I think Dee
Keesler was on the right track
when he said discussion of the
matter was outside of their
realm. By now the members of
E.C. should have more tact
when they express public opi-
nions such as those criticisms
expressed.

Let me first address Mr.
Fraser who felt much of the
Ariel was trash. My first im-
pression was similar; however,
I did give the magazine more
than a fifteen-minute glance.
Closer inspection led me to ap-
preciate some of the accom-
plishments of the magazine.
First of all, this last issue was
one of the first attempts I have
recently seen to present the
material in a creative, modern,
and free-form style. Undoubted-
ly Mr. Fraser would call some
of E.E. Cummings poems,
which are scrawled and often
without titles, trash.

A few pages featured graffiti
which is finally coming to be
recognized as an art form.
Some very successful associa-
tions were made between the
drawings, photographs, and
poems. It was rather refreshing
that the book didn’t overdo the
typical appearance of sunrises,
forests, clouds, and beach
scenes that accompany equally
humdrum poems. Further-
more, Chris Faye has a limited
donation of creative works to
choose from. If they were lack-
ing in talent, then that would be
the fault of the students, not the
editor.

Jay Blumburg claims he is no
literary critic and should re-
main so. (He would also do well
to refrain from comments on
some financial matters.) The
E.C. has let more blatent ex-
amples of poor budgeting slide

!
'

in its recent dealings with the
Cold Check Committee, the
U.C.C. and the S.A.B. Remem-
ber the $3,000 lost when Levon
Helm canceled his concert? By
these standards $182 over the
estimated budget is a drop in
the bucket. Having investigated
the matter further the original
$1582 was negotiated down to
$1450 when Chris Faye disputed
the bill with The News-Gazette.
Going only $50 over his
estimated budget seems com-
mendable to me. I do agree,
however, that Chris Faye could
have shopped around for a bet-
ter bid. The University un-
doubtedly would have been
cheaper than The News-Gazette
by a long shot.

Most disappointing was Eddie
Schenecker’s comment that
some of the material was offen-
sive. Some material was shock-
ing. The response was the same
when Monet produced A Lunch-
eon on the Grass and Olympia.
DuChamps when he placed a
urinal on display and called his
sculpture The Fountain was
viciously attacked by an ig-
norant press. It was, however,
one of the most revolutionary
breakthroughs in modern art
and precipitated the Dadaist
Movement.

Casual analysis would reveal
that the Ariel’s editor is not
bound by the same code of jour-
nalism ethics which binds the
editor of the Ring-tum Phi. The
editor of the Ariel is not trying
to be objective nor is he an
honest broker of facts. Instead
he is reproducing creative
works of artistic merit. It is
often hard for those who are so
firmly rooted in a traditional
art form to accept this. The
Ariel was not printed for the
closed-minded or little old
ladies. Perhaps this can be best
summed up in a quote of

Letters To The Editor

 

‘Misunderstanding’ Resolved

Dear editor:

We are writing this letter in
an attempt to clear the muddy
waters which seem to have
developed as a result of a
misunderstanding at Monday's
Executive Committee meeting.
This controversy arose over
Bruce Poole’s role as an E.C. ad
hoc member to the Student Con-
trol Committee, and the fact
that he may have voted twice
during a proceeding. It is possi-
ble that he may have cast the
second vote after having agreed
that he should not continue this
practice.

Bruce was unable to recall
these facts, and Steve Abraham
acted to “clarify the situation
for the record."’ This occurred

only after a reporter at the .

meeting had opened discussion
on the topic.

Since the meeting Monday,
Bruce has reflected upon his
participation in the Student
Control meeting in question. He

realizes now that he indeed may |

have voted twice and makes his
sincerest apologies to the Stu-
dent Body for his wrong actions.

Steve in no way intended his
comments to Bruce to be view-
ed as if he was publicly attack-
ing Bruce, he merely sought to
clarify the situation. However,
he does realize that he should
have possibly done so when this
issue first discussed. Steve
regrets this misunderstanding
has arisen.

The misunderstanding has
been resolved, and we hope that
its ramifications are not blown

out of proportion.
Sincerely,
Steve Abraham
Bruce Poole

 

 

STAND To Meet

Dear Editor,

As we begin the second
semester and enter the 1980's
STAND, Students and
Townspeople Against Nuclear
Development, will be expan-
ding its efforts to inform the
community of the unacceptable
dangers of nuclear energy.
Since we have been back, two
film presentations have been
made. No Act of God, an award
winning documentary by the
National Film Board of Canada,
and I Have Three Children of
My Own, an excellent slide
show prepared by Dr. Helen
Caldicott, a pediatrician who
has worked extensively with
children diseased by cancer,
were both well received by
students and local citizens.

This Monday at 8:00 in Reid
203 a lecture on the history of
the nuclear waste program in
this country and where it is go-
ing will be given by Chris
Tolleson. Following the presen-

Bruce W. Whipple '80

Dear Sir,

After reading Bruce Whip-
ple’s letter, I would like to add a
few comments of my own. Aside
from a few typographical and
layout errors, I thought the
Ariel was quite creative and ex-
plorative. Coufal’s tale was
tasteless and perhaps reflected
an S/M mentality. I recognize
artistic license, but blatant porn
is offensive to me. Otherwise,
the Ariel was quite appealing.

tation we will try to organize an
action group whose duties will
be to keep an eye on reports in
the media and in government,
and to orchestrate petitioning
and letter campaigns, and to
keep us up on activities going on
across the nation and in the
State of Virginia.

Incidentally, Lightworks in
Lexington is the base of opera-
tions for a Renewable Energy
Legislative Proposal which is
now being considered in Rich-
mond. It includes a proposal for
a tax deduction of 25% on the
cost of any energy im-
provements made on homes
and businesses. More informa-
tion about the proposals and
what you can do to help can be
obtained directly by calling
Lightworks at 463-9445. Mostly,
however, they are in need of
envelope stuffers and the like.
Any time you can spare in this
way would be greatly ap-
preciated. The lobbying effort is
being spearheaded by a local,
John MacLeod, who will be
speaking on his experiences
with the legislation as well as
the potentials of renewable

energy resources for the’

economy at one of the STAND
meetings in the near future.

In the meantime a benefit for
STAND is being held in the
Cockpit tonight. The band’s new
name is the Surburban
Parasites, (once considered to
be the Space Rangers) and is
made up of local musicians and
one or two students. They
played in the pit just before
Christmas break and do ex-
cellent versions of the Allman
Brothers, Grateful Dead, as
well as a few originals. We'll
also be showing two short films.
One of which is of the student
demonstrations held here at
U.Va. after the Kent State kill-
ings. Because it is a benefit we
can’t charge a cover, but we ask
for a donation of a dollar or
more if you can give it. Your
support will be greatly ap-
preciated when the band starts

Bring Back The Hangings

To the Editor:

One afternoon before the be-
ginning of Christmas break, I
went to the Supply Store to find
out if I could purchase one of
those wall hangings stating:
‘When Better Women are
Made, W&L Men Will Make
Them.” To my chagrin, I was
told by one of the cashiers that
these particular hangings were
no longer sold due to objections
voiced by some women law stu-
dents. I was rather disap-
pointed and very much surpris-
ed.

I have two objections regard-
ing these hangings no longer be-
ing sold. The first of these is
that a few women law students
that make up a very small
minority of the student body
can, according to their whim,
elimate the sale of a certain
product that happens not to ap-
peal to them. This is obviously
unfair to the rest of the student
body (especially those of us who
want to buy one of these hang-
ings). Why should student de-
mand for these hangings (which
was obviously present because
they were being sold) go un-
fulfilled because of the ideas. of
what I assume to be a few
crusading zealots? I assert that
there is no reason why the sale
of these wall hangings should
have been stopped. Further-
more, the sale of the hangings
should resume immediately.

My second objection to this
occurrence concerns the ac-
tions of the women law students
who were successful in banning
the sale of the hangings. If these
women are truly interested in
pursuing women’s liberation, or
whatever they wish to call it,
why do they waste their time on
trivial matters such as this? It
seems to me that if they were
truly interested in their
“‘cause,’’ they would appeal, via
writing, to the various state
assemblies which have not ap-
proved the Equal Rights
Amendment, instead of spend-
ing their time seeing to it that a
certain wall hanging (which I
assume they perceive to be ex-
ploitative) is no longer sold at

Boycott The Olympics

President Carter has found himself in the center of controversy
because he has urged the United States Olympic Committee to
withdraw from the summer games in Moscow if the Soviets refuse
to withdraw from Afghanistan by Feb. 20. This is yet another issue
in which Americans must look beyond special interests if the in-
terests of our nation are to be safeguarded. When the President in-
itially suggested that a boycott by the American Olympic con-
tingent may be imminent, my initial reaction was that this
measure would be grossly unfair to the athletes who have trained
for years in pursuit of elusive Olymipic glory.

The sobering effect of more recent developments such as the
Soviet buildup on the Iranian border and the threatening Soviet
troop alert in Eastern Europe has led me to conclude that we must
deprive the Soviets of the policy legitimization and propaganda
benefits of hosting the Olympics. The Soviets clearly preceive these
as benefits of the Olympics and therefore desire American par-
ticipation in the world’s greatest spectacle.

It is true that our amateur athletes will bear the overwhelming
burden of an Olympic boycott. They will be no more adversely af-
fected than the farmers, however, because the future absense of
the Soviet market and the surplus grain intended for the Soviet
Union will surely depress the long term grain market. The value of
an Olympic boycott and a trade embargo lies in attempting to.deter
the expansionist Soviet policies without -resorting to military
responses. Should we fail to peacefully restrain these bearlike ag-
gressions on virtually defenseless nations, the sacrifices many of
our peers will be asked to undergo will make those of Olympic

athletes and farmers look paltry indeed.
