Sunday Party Fie

Violation
Dismissed

by Ross Newell

The Interfraternity Council,
during its meeting Tuesday
night, investigated a Sunday
fraternity party in violation of
IFC rules and decided not to
take any action.

The party, held by Phi Kappa
Sigma, Delta Tau Delta, Beta
Theta Pi and Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon, violated the rules because
it ran past 6 p.m. on Sunday.
IFC rules require that Sunday
parties end at 6 p.m. because
this is recognized as the time
when the coming school-week
begins.

A spokesman for the frater-
nities said a band that the
fraternities had signed was
scheduled to stop playing at
6:00; however, because of dif-
ficulties, they could not start
playing until 3 P.M. The party
continued until 7 p.m., the
spokesman said, because the
band had to be payed $700 and it
would not have been worth this
price if they had only played for
three hours.

Also, he said the Saturday
blizzard had prevented some of
the fraternities involved from
having bands Saturday night
and their houses wanted to have
at least one band during Fancy
Dress weekend.

Also, during the meeting, Rob
Brooke and Monty Briscoe were
nominated for IFC president.
For vice-president, Chip
Nunley, John Northington and
Hall Vetterlein were
nominated. All fraternity
members can vote in the elec-
tion which will be held Monday
in conjunction with the student
body elections.

Nominations are open until 8
a.m. Friday and additional
nominations are to be reported
to IFC president Syd Farrar or
to Carole Chappell in the
University Center.

 

IFC Weekend

Regarding IFC weekend, it is
scheduled for March 22. The
Good Humour Band has been
signed and another band is be-
ing sought. Approximately 40-50
kegs of beer will be provided at
the party and non-fraternity
members will be charged
around $10 per couple to attend
the party.

Return To
Communities,

Davis Urges

by Ed Edge

The responsibility of minority
students, as well as all other
black students, once they have
been educated, is to not turn
their back on their origin, but
return to their communities and
pass down the cultural riches to
younger generations, Ossie
Davis said last night in his
speech at Washington and Lee’s
Warner Athletic Center.

Davis was presented by the
university’s Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity as their
third speaker for this ninth an-
nual ‘‘Black Emphasis Week.”’

_He stated that a person who
belongs to a minority group can
only advance as far in life as the
others that are in his minority
group, adding that he must
have a ‘‘power base”’ of his peo-
ple under him to back him.

“We (blacks) never had the
same opportunities to get ahead

Untenured Teachers In Tough Job Competition

by Mike Perry
Declining enrollments, coupl-
ed with an increasingly com-
petitive teaching job market,
make the frustrations suffered
by untenured teachers here at
Washington and Lee typical of
the national situation.
Approximately 63.5 percent of
the nation’s full-time faculty
members’ have tenure.
Washington and Lee’s 75 per-
cent ranks well above this na-
tional average.

Petitions Filed With EC

Only one petition for each of
the Excutive Committee “Big
Three” positions was submitted
Monday night.

Filing petitions were Rob
Willis for president, Willie
Macke for Vice-president, and
Bud White for secretary.

Elections will be held Monday
from 9-4, Polls will be set up in
the quad, the law school, and in
front of the commerce school.

Candidates are limited to 30
campaign posters, two banners,
and a $20 spending limit. Write-
in candidates are subject to the
same rules.

This increase in the number
of tenured faculty members
serves only to increase the com-
petitive nature of the teaching
job market. ‘“‘The person who
loses out on tenure is angry,”
says Jordan Karland, national
associate secretary of the
American Association of
University Professors (AAUP).
“If he came along five or 10
years ago, he would have made

everywhere,’ .Sheldon H.
Knorr, Maryland State Com-
missioner for Higher Educa-
tion, told the Baltimore Sun.
“Tenure is going to be much
more carefully granted now.”
Still, there are variations
from state to state. Public in-
stitutions tend to have a higher
tenure ratio (66.4 percent) than
private institutions (56.2 per-
cent) and some states such as
Washington (72.3 percent) have
a particularly high percentage
of tenured faculty members as
compared to a less tenured
areas such as the District of
Columbia with 27 percent.
University administrators

must continually concern
themselves with maintaining
their flexibility to deal with
‘changing enrollments in
various academic disciplines.
Currently, interest in such
liberal arts as history and
philosophy is on the wane while
enrollments climb in business
and engineering programs.
Educators say they must
carefully portion faculty spots
leading to tenure where enroll-
ment demands are greatest.
Those teachers competing for
the limited number of tenured
positions now must amass glow-
ing credentials in three areas:

Candidates For Secretary Square Off On Issues

by Joe Scott

Candidates for Washington
and Lee’s big three Executive
Committee positions discussed
and debated their views
Wednesday night in the Nor-
thern Undergraduate Library
auditorium.

Bob Willis is running unop-
posed for EC president while
Willy Mackie is the only entrant
tor the vice-presidential spot.
Three persons are entered for
secretary; Bud White, Robert
Neely and Dan Weiss. Neely
and Weiss are write-in can-
didates.

Elections for the positions
will be held Monday, March 10.
Differences in the secretary
candidates views are listed
below.

White Book changes

Weiss-‘‘Honor has not chang-
ed that much over the years’”’
Every year brings up its own
situations. Changes are impor-
tant. Regarding the honor code,
‘Re-education of classes could

be important. I also think that if
you put all the honor informa-
tion into one packet it would be
helpful.”

Neely-Freshmen orientation
is probably the most important
thing the EC does in the beginn-
ing. We are supposed to be
representatives of the student
body.’’ Honor is very important
tome.

White-‘‘Upperclassmen don’t
need to be reindoctrinated. I
don’t think it is necessary.”’
When a change is instituted it
should be adhered to. Freshmen
orientation could have more
emphasis placed on the honor
code.

Coeducation

White-‘‘The disadvantages
outweigh the advantages at this
time. It would hurt the system
more than it would help.

Weiss-‘‘The survey idea was a
good one. I agree with Bob
Willis’ idea of increasing the ex-
change program. It would ex-
pand discussion in classes.

$1.2 Million —
To Grow

Seaweed

Guess what you paid for. A
$1.2 million project to grow
seaweed on the Pacific Ocean
floor and try to use it for
energy.

General Electric Co. was
given the grant by the Energy
Department to transplant 100
kelp plants in the ocean even
though DOE scientists sug-
gested growing the seaweeds
“under well-controlled condi-
tions...on land-based aquatic
test sites.”

The kelp had all been washed
away within two months and the
project was a $1.2 million
failure.

The project and others were
disclosed in an internal DOE
report outlining millions of
dollars in worthless projects.

Record Review

Linda Ronstadt’s

By Mark Kinniburgh

Linda Ronstadt has a new album out on Asylum
Records, and if you liked the old Linda Ronstadt,
Mad Love is for you. Linda has been accused of
failing to live up to her debut solo album since
1970, partly because of the quality of Heart like a
Wheel, but even more so because of the early sup-
port she gained from her California Buddies, the
Eagles.

It seemed that when Linda departed from the
easy country feel of that first release she would be
charged with selling out to the popular side of the
music business. Time was when the The Eagles
and Linda Ronstadt were mentioned in the same
breath as being the same stylistically and of one
big musical family. Despite the constant
criticism, Linda has continued what could best be
described as a metamorphosis from one style of
musical expressions to the next, while never
forgetting the previous stage.

While some critics felt that the last album, Liv-
ing in the USA, was the definitive sell-out, (Look at
that!!! Roller Skating on the cover in a disco get-
up!!), there was a definite originality and identity
that was Ronstadt. Even more important about
Living is that it stands as a transition between the
Ronstadt of the East Coast and the Ronstadt of the
West Coast. Back in the West, the relaxed artist
comes through in the environs of Los Angeles
again with an album of the quality and consistence
of Heart Like A Wheel.

Mad Love is not many things, and that is what
makes it such a complete record. Number one, it
is not a highly polished, technically flawless album
thereby devoid of any personality. With someone
of the talent of Ronstadt there is a danger of mak-
ing a perfect record without feeling because
realistically, the caliber of musicians is high and

 

and reception that evening at 8 p.m., to mark the
opening of the exhibition in the library's Northen
Auditorium. The public is invited both to view the
exhibition and to attend the reception. The artist's
exhibition at Washington and Lee will continue
through April 12.

‘Mad Love’

rarely would make those little mistakes that re-
mind the listener that an artist is human be made.

Secondly, Mad Love is not a copy of any other
Ronstadt album, nor does it depart from being ob-
viously a Linda Ronstadt album. The feeling is
there, the vocal hook that sets Linda apart from
the rest in its sensual phrasing is there, and to put
all the pieces together, the music selection is
outstanding.

My favorites are the title cut Mad love and the
Elvis Costello tune Girls Talk, one of three
Costello songs on the album. Another favorite that
is getting a great deal of attention on the AM air-
waves is Hurts so Bad the old popular song which
Linda handles in her own soulful way.

Reading the liner notes one will notice the new
force behind the Ronstadt of the West in the person
of Mark Goldenberg who has replaced Andrew
Gold as Linda’s favorite writer and musical com-
panion. Goldenberg supplies several of the albums
songs and, according to Ronstadt, is the next best
writer in rock to Elvis Costello. The listener
should not be afraid of the criticism that this
album is the new wave Linda because even though
there is a Costello influence and it may seem at
first listen that there has been a real change, with
further spins the old Ronstadt will come through
and be just as strong as before.

Next week look for a review of the new Elvis
Costello by quest commentator John Cole...Heart
has a new album on CBS records and it’s called
Bebe Le Strange...Johnny Winter is back with
another one called Raisin’ Warren Zevon’s latest
on E/A is called Bad Luck Streak in Dancing
School...Pink Floyd is still at number one on all
major record rating charts...Queen is writing and
recording the complete soundtrack to Dino
Delaurentis’ production of Flash Gordon...

_—— Film Notes

The Front (1976) Martin Ritt’s look at the red scare of the 1950’s
as it affected a portion of the entertainment business in New York
during the McCarthy era. Woody Allen, starring in his first non-
directoral film, provides the movie’s comic highs as a small time
bookie who poses as the author of television scripts written by a
blacklisted friend. The story bogs down into pathos with Zero
Mostelas an aging comic who finds his career and life ruined by
communist witch-hunting. Not a comedy. Presented by the SAB,
March 7th, 8th, and 9th, at 7 and 9 p.m. in Dupont auditorium. Ad-
mission is $1. ;

 

The Passenger (1975) Starring Jack Nicholson and Marie
Schneider, presented by the Film Society. A discussion appears in
this issue of the Ring-tum Phi.

The Garden of the Finzi-Contini’s (Italy, 1971) Directed by Vit-
torio DeSica, one of the original Italian neorealists. One of his last
films and, while similar to his earlier works in theme, it is un-
characeristically sentimental. To be shown in Reid 203, Tuesday
March 11th, at 7 and 9 p.m. Admission is free.

Film Society Presents

Antonioni’s “The Passenger’

by Jay Norfleet

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will screen
Michelangelo Antonioni’s The
Passenger (1975) on Friday and
Saturday, March 7 and 8, at 8
p.m. in classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis
Hall. Admission is free and
everyone is cordially invited.

Antonioni’s works before The
Passenger constitute some of
the landmarks in New Wave
cinema: L’Avventura (1960),
Red Desert (1964), and Blow Up
(1966). In these films, Antonioni
explores the uneasiness and
lack of meaning in the lives of
upper middle class people, and
the way they bring meaning in-
to their lives. ThePassenger is

-also in this vein.

The plot revolves around a
documentary news reporter
who seeks to change places with
a man whose death he
discovers. The man has been a
gunrunner for a group of
African revolutionaries and the

The. Nighthawks Return

by Ross Newell

The Nighthawks are schedul-
ed to appear in the Cockpit next
Friday night and the show pro-
mises to be so hot that it might
start the spring thaw early.

The Hawks played at the 1980
Winter Olympics and sources
close to the scene say that the
American hockey team used
energy from the band’s power-
ful brand of rock ’n roll to help
them pound the teams from
Russia and Finland.

If you get into blues and good
music, you too will get a charge
from the Nighthawks. Their
shows represent a nice change
of pace from the soul and beach
music that students at
Washington and Lee so often
see for live entertainment.

Campus entertainment is im-
proving and scheduling the
Hawks is a further step in the
right direction. The band has
been gaining national
acclaim—their tours now carry
them nationwide and few who
see them are disappointed.

Also, many nationally promi-
nent blues and rock artists have
played with the Nighthawks, in-
cluding Muddy Waters, John
Hammond, George Thorogood

and Gregg Allman.
The band has released five
albums and is said to be

negotiating the release of
another album, on a major
label.

The Hawks are most noted for
the guitar playing of their lead
Jim Thackery and the harp
wailing of Mark Wenner. Music
critics generally agree that
Thackery can blow most better-
known commercial guitarists
off the stage. During January,
in Washington, D.C., the
Hawks’ home base, Thackery
jammed with Thorogood in the

middle of M Street—stopping
traffic for several minutes. The
two bands were playing in bars
on opposite sides of the streets
and apparently the guitarists
couldn’t resist meeting midway
for an impromptu session.

Critics have also acclaimed
Wenner’s harp playing. They
say Wenner can leave most
harp players with their mouths
hanging open—including Magic
Dick of the J. Geils Band.

The Hawks’ music is hard-
driving and loud; however, it is

both tight and professional.

The University Center Com-
mittee has scheduled the
Nighthawks for two Cockpit
shows at 8:30 and 10:30 on
March 14. 200 tickets will be
available for each show at $4
per ticket. The tickets went on
sale today and will be sold until
the 14th during class hours C-G

in the Co-op and at Carole Chap- |

pell’s office in the Cockpit lob-
by. The Nighthawks played two
shows in the Cockpit last year
and both were well received.

ex-reporter runs into trouble in
keeping the appointments he
has inherited. While he is on his
journey, he is accompanied by a
girl he meets, the ‘‘passenger,”’

and is also sought by his wife -

whom he left in London when he
took on the African assignment.
In the end, his new life and his
old catch up with him.

Besides being a film about
identity, The Passenger also
poses other questions, primari-
ly through the use of striking
visual imagery. The ability to
know or be certain is called into
question, to the extent that even
the camera cannot fully know
the truth (for the camera is a
definite character in the film).

' Also, there are existential im-

plications in the search for
meaning the reporter under-
takes. Antonioni explores the
limitations of both man and his
invention, film.

The movie stars Jack
Nicholson, with Maria
Schneider as the passenger.

The Film Society will soon
hold a meeting to select
spring movie(s). Watch for an-
nouncements giving details of
date, time, and place, or call
Professor Kaston at 463-9111,
ext. 367, or Jay Diesing at
463-4532 or 463-2750.

The Film Society’s next
scheduled presentation will be
Franco Brusati’s “Bread and
Chocolate,”’ to be shown Mar.
28-29.

The Folly Of 48

By Bill Whalen

‘Good afternoon and welcome to the 1999 NCAA
basketball tournament! We’re glad you decided to
join us at NBC as we telecast each tournament game
from the original round of 128 all the way to the final
four round to be held sometime in September.”

This may seem a little far-fetched, but it probably
won’t be too different from what will eventually hap-
pen in the NCAA Tournament. With more and more
teams qualifying for postseason bids, the NCAA
tourney cannot help but turn into the same fiasco that
is otherwise called the NBA playoffs.

In the 1980 tournament, the NCAA is showing us
that they are trying to make their tournament more
evenly matched per each round. Unfortunately, the
tournament committee is taking the wrong approach.

The NCAA’s theory is that in order to guarantee
that an uncolossal amount of teams don’t get left out
of the postseason festivities, the field:should be ex-
panded by eight positions. If ever there were a case of
misconstrued logic, this is it.

Before this year, there seemed to enough positions,
seeing as the tournament went for a long time but
didn’t drag along like the NBA postseason does. What
the NCAA should have done (and didn’t) was to keep
the field at the same number but disregard the
automatic bid policy.

This seems to be the NCAA’s problem. First, the
selecting committee is straddled by having to admit
too many weak sisters, such as VCU and Furman,
through the automatic-qualifying policy. And more
importantly, the selecting committee should look a
little harder at seasonal performances before setting
up the regional brackets.

In the Eastern Regional selecting, the committee
must have been drawing names out of hats to deter-
mine who went where. Syracuse, losers in the Big
East final to Georgetown, are ranked first while the
Hoyas, who have won 16 of their last 17 contests, are
seeded third and will more than likely face Maryland
in the round of 16.

Kentucky, loser of two of three encounters with
Louisiana State, got to stay home (in Lexington, no
less) while the Tigers were placed in the Midwest.
Duke, winner of the ACC Tourney, was placed in the
Mideast, while two of its conference opponents got
places in the easier East.

Meanwhile, Depaul, arguably the best team in the
Midwest, was ranked first in the Western Regional.
And who’s got the top seeding in the Midwest? Why
LSU, of course. You try to figure it out.

The only explanation that I can make for all of this
is that, in the rush to get the bids out, the selection
commitee looked at records instead of judging such
relative factors as how hard a team’s conference was,
who its opponents were, and what the team’s recent
record is. In each case, the NCAA has shown a disdain
for these factors.

Nonetheless, the NCAA maysomeday read this and
will probably laugh. And laugh all the way to the
bank, I might add. For despite the mismatches, over-

Cagers Dropped Twice
In Tourney Appearance

By Dale Park

The Washington and Lee Var-
sity Basketball team, the new
O.D.A.C. champs, traveled to
Orange County, New Jersey
last weekend to take part in the
N.C.A.A. Division III Tourna-
ment held at Upsala College.

This marked the fourth time
that Head Coach Verne Can-
field’s hoopsters had gone to the
N.C.A.A.’s and for the fourth
time the Generals were unable
to advance past the first round,
this year losing a close one to
nationally-ranked host, Upsala,
75-70.

Behind by 49-40 at the half,
the Generals roared back to
take a_ two-point lead . with
roughly three minutes to go.

Yet an Upsala surge late in
the game ended W&L’s hope of
continuing in the tournament.
With Upsala’s Steve Keenan
leading the way with 22 points
and eleven rebounds, the
Generals fell behind for good
and were finally laid to rest.

Despite the loss, the Generals
had a well-balanced scoring at-
tack with four players in
double-figures. Sophomore
guard George Spears led all
scorers with 19 points, followed
by junior center Rob Smither-
man who poured in 15 points
and grabbed seven rebounds
and remained the Generals’
mainstay of consistence in the
latter part of the season.

In addition, freshmen for-
ward Brian Hansen, a good
asset for W&L’s future basket-
ball hopes, and junior forward
R. J. Scaggs, the key man on
the Generals’ defense all season

 

George Spears, starting point guard, was named to the all-

around jumper.

long, both netted 12 points
apiece.

Team-captain senior forward
Tom Jeffries, a member of this
year’s first team all-O.D.A.C.
squad, accounted for 10 points.

In the consolation game ver-
sus Alleghany, playing as
though drawn by the long and
emotional season, the Generals
were easily downed 103-80.

Having trouble containing
Alleghany’s Jim Wheeler and

 
       

tournament team in the NCAA Regionals.

     

ent

Rob Smitherman, the Generals’ starting center, goes for a turn-

Eric Lingburg, who scored 24
and 21 points respectively, W&L
fell behind 48-32 at halftime and
never lead during the contest.

Although the Generals’ scor-
ing was balanced, the team shot
only 40 percent from the field.

Jeffries led his team with an
impressive 22 points and 10 re-
bounds, followed by Hansen
with 14 points. Spears and
Smitherman picked up 13 points
apiece, while sophomore guard
Clark New chipped in eight.

For the season, Jeffries led
the Generals in rebounding (7.1
per game), and scoring (15
points per game), followed
closely by Smitherman who
averaged 7.0 rebounds and 11
points per game over the
Season. Spears led the team in
assists with 89 on the season and
averaged 10.4 points per game,

The season is over. Despite
everything, including a 14-15
final record, the Washington
and Lee Generals are the 1980
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference Champions.

By Chris Sisto

“I’m very excited about the
enthusiasm from the players
this year; they’re working real-
ly well together and I’m sure
we’re going to have a different
look this year.” This flow of op-
timism came from Head Coach
Chuck Kroll about the 1980
Generals’ baseball team.

Kroll, in his second year as
head coach, is confident that
this year’s team can change the
record set last year when the
Generals didn’t win more than
six games and finished last in
the ODAC. His plan this year is
to have a smaller and younger
squad.

“I decided to make cuts this
year and get the team down toa
more workable 22 man roster,”’
said Kroll. ‘‘Of this, we have on-
ly five seniors, .one junior, and
the rest are sophomores and
freshmen (eight apiece).”’

Kroll feels that this young
talent could be an advantage as
they work toward a winning
season. Said Kroll, ‘“These guys
are quicker and more agressive
than last year. They really want
to win.”

To have a winning season this
year, the Generals must play
more consistently in all facets
of the game. What happened too
often last year was that the
team’s hitting would break
down while the pitching was

good or the Generals would lose
high scoring affairs when the
pitchers couldn’t get the timely
outs.

Kroll is positive that with both
the team’s depth and more sup-
port from the school during
home games, this year’s situa-
tion will be different.

The pitching staff is led by
five returning upperclassmen
and two freshmen. The big gun
for the Generals is Chip Chiles’
who posted a 0.00 earned run
average last year.

Chiles is somewhat of a ques-
tion mark, however, suffering a-
broken leg injury this past sum-
mer and having a steel plate in-
serted in his leg. Other return-
ing pitchers who had consistent
performances last year are
sophomores Mark McLaughlin
and Rick Hachenburg and
senior Vic Shepherd.

In the infield, the Generals
have two returning starters:
Sophomore Jeff Haggerty at
third base and senior John
Stagmaier at second. Rounding
out the rest of the infield will be
freshmen Mark Hough at first
base and Chris Cavalline at
shortstop. The catching chores
will be split up by junior Tom
Coates and sophomore Trip
Brower.

The outfield will be led by

Netmen Look Strong As Usual
With Combo Of Jackson, Norris

By Dale Park

The W&L VaristyTennis team
opens up its 1980 season this
Saturday, March 8, against the
visiting University of
Rochester.

The contest is the first of five
home matches for W&L’s
On Sunday, the
Generals will host Penn State,
with three more matches to be
held the following weekend.

W&L has been 0.D.A.C. ten-
nis champ for the past three
seasons, and has a strong trio of
seniors returning this year.

Co-captain Stewart Jackson,
from Lake Forest, IIl., will lead
the Generals’ attack. Jackson is
a three-time Division III All-
American as well as last year’s
0.D.A.C. Player of the Year.

The other captain, David Con-

stine from Richmond, Va., is
the defending fourth singles
champion in the O.D.A.C. Con-
stine will again play at the
fourth spot this year.

The third senior, Pat Norris
of Dallas,Texas, was one-half of
last years’ second doubles team
that finished second in the
0.D.A.C. Norris’ partner is

Robert Schuler, who as a junior
letterman, returns this year.
Two freshmen, Jackson Shar-
man (Tuscaloosa, Ala.) and
Steve Denny (Bethesda, Md.)
are among the remaining
singles starters for this Satur-
day’s match, playing at second
and sixth singles, respectively.

Fancy Dress Report

 

$10,000 Mink Recovered

by Mark Suber

A Hollins College freshman
returned to the coat room after
the Fancy Dress Ball Friday
night to find that her $10,000 full
length mink coat had been
taken.

Sarah Whitney Lindsey said
she returned to the coat room
with her date, W&L sophomore
Michael Collier, and could not
find her coat. After repeated ef-
forts to locate it, the two decid-
ed to wait until all the coats
were gone and then check
again. When the coat still did
not turn up they realized it had
been taken.

Lexington Police Chief J.A.
Kirby said at approximately
6:30 p.m. on Sunday he received
information from a W&L stu-
dent about who had taken the
coat. The student was able to
recover the coat and turned it
into the police department.

pocket of the coat, was still
missing.

Kirby said the case is still
under investigation.

Police Violations Down
From Last Year

by Marc Birenbaum

The recent snow storm may
have helped the Lexington City
Policy as a low 57 complaints
were filed last weekend.

“On some weekends like Fan-
cy Dress, with good weather,
the complaints are over 70,”
said Police Chief J. A. Kirby.
“‘We found most students park-
ed their cars on Saturday night
and walked to their parties.”’

More than sixty percent of the
complaints filed dealt with
violations of parking in a
restricted zone of which
“probably a majority of those
involved are students,” said

Kirby.

One complaint, which Kirby
said did not involve a student,
charged an individual with
operating a snowmobile on
public streets without proper
equipment and a license.

On Friday, one Washington
and Lee student was charged
with possession of marijuana
when police stopped his car at
the intersection of Washington
and Jefferson streets for
allegedly running a light, said
the student.

The student, said Monday he

had some drug paraphanelia
with some resin on it in his car.

Party Rescheduled

I apologize to all those who
made plans to attend the
Freshman class party on Satur-
day, March 1. The cancellation
was made due to severe driving
conditions. However, the party
has been re-scheduled for Sun-
day, April 27, 1980 at the
Pavillion.

All class passes and tickets
purchased will be honored. Fur-
thermore, all those who bought
tickets and will not be able to at-
tend the April party will be
refunded in full.

Minority Affairs Office Busy
With Recruiting Activities

by David Greer

This week is Black Emphasis
Week and this function is keep-
ing one of the assistant deans
very busy.

John White is the coordinator
of minority affairs. Presently,
his office deals chiefly with the
interests of black students on
campus and those who are ap-
plying for admission to W&L.

White says he is trying to ex-
pand recruitment efforts to
other minorities, but most of his
recruiting efforts have been
focused on blacks. He spent
about six weeks this year on
recruiting trips.

While most of the activities
sponsored by White’s office
seem to focus on black students,
they are designed to include all
students.

“The big misconception is
that white students see the
black activities are for black
students only. They are open to
all students,’’ White says.

For example, the SABU Ball
this weekend is open to all
students free of charge. Only
those outside the W&L com-
munity will be charged.

White is the advisor for the
Student Association for Black
Unity. Of the 12 black
undergraduate students, 10 are
members of SABU. There is
another group for black law
students.

The minority affairs office
sponsors many functions during
the year. It is presently spon-
soring a Black Alumni Con-
ference in conjunction with
Black Emphasis Week.

Many of the functions are not
funded entirely by the minority
affairs office but are shared
with other organizations.

For example, poet Vernon
Turner’’s fee was split with the
Glasgow Endowment Fund,
each paying $300.

Stokely Carmichael’s speak-
ing fee was $350, Ossie Davis’
$2,000.

The office is co-sponsoring a
jazz group with the Va.
Historical Society. The group
will perform here later this
semester and admission will be
free to students. The office is
paying $300 so no cover will
have to be charged.

The office is paying $1,200 for
the SABU Ball. It will provide
hors d’oeuvres; the university
will sponsor a cash bar.

There are many misconcep-
tions about special privileges
for minority students on cam-
pus. For example, they are not
given special housing
preference in the dorms, seven
of the 12 are freshmen and
many of the others live in
Woods Creek.

The lounge in Davis dorm has
not been given to SABU either,
despite a popular notion. The
facility is open to all students
who would like to sign it out for
functions.

SABU does have an office in
the student center, which is also
used by the university for other
needs.

we were converted to cheap

freed them, Davis said and add-

Admitted to the Tennessee

serving as an ordained Baptist

He was named to the FCC in
1972, and was a commissioner

ladder there was a place for
them.

“It is not bigotry that has held
us down for so long; we could
outrun the bigots—it is the in-
stitution of racism that has been
the barrier to us,”’ he said.

Davis went on to explain that
bigotry is purely related to in-
dividual beliefs, but racism is
an istitution that can affect
large segments of society, and
he cited the industrial shift of
the factories in the Northeast to
the South where there was little
or no unionization and there
was cheap black labor as an ex-
ample.

In his call for the students to
return to their communities to
help the less fortunate ones left
behind, he reminded us that
what works for one group
should, could and would work
for another group and pointed
out that all people are brothers
and should keep in mind as we
try to solve the race problems.

“As you prepared in these
walls to find your niche in socie-
ty, don’t forget those you left
behind, don’t turn your back on
them, for they are your base on
which to build,” Davis again
pointed out to the students.

‘*Responsibility—never
forget responsibility that you
have to your fellow people, and
keep in mind that you are the
exception to the rule, you are
the fortunate one—you are the
one that the people will look to
for advancement,’’ Davis
reminded the students.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Monday’s Contest

In case you haven’t heard yet, there’s an election
Monday. It’s called the Big Three Election because it
will fill the three most important positions on our stu-
dent government. The Interfraternity Council is also
holding its elections for the president and vice-
president of that body.

Apathy reigns at W&L. The presidential candidate,
Bob Willis, and the vice-presidential candidate, Willy
Mackie, are running without opposition. We could rail
against the student body for its apathy and the lack of
competition for these two important posts, but that
would be useless—we’ve done it in the past without
success.

There is some choice when selecting the school’s
secretary. Bud White will be on the ballot and Robert
Neely and Dan Weiss are write-in candidates. Un-
fortunately, most of you don’t know the candidates’
views on various issues that will affect you next year.
The candidates gave speeches and stated their posi-
tions in a meeting last night, but only three students
bothered to show up—one of them a Phi reporter.

As usual there is more choice in the fraternity con-
test. Two students are running for the presidency of
the IFC, Rob Brooke (of Phi Kappa Sigma) and Mon-
ty Briscoe (of Pi Kappa Alpha). Three are in conten-
tion for the vice-presidency: Chip Nunley (of Phi Kap-
pa Psi), John Northington (of Kappa Alpha), and Hall
Vetterlein ( of Delta Tau Delta).

Perhaps fraternity members take their own
government more seriously than the students take
theirs. We don’t know, but we do detect a distinct
trend in the lack of competition every year for the
highest offices in the student government.

Frankly the choice is yours. It’s your government
which is supposed to represent your views. It’s also
your job to support our student government even if
you feel they are ineffective. They are your only ma-
jor outlet to express your ideas and concerns.

So if you didn’t run for an elective office, at least
give them a show of support by voting.

At least the candidates will know they weren’t the
only ones who knew there was an election.

Carmichael
Speech

Dear Editor:

Because of the allegations
contained in the exchange of let-
ters between Mr. David F.
Mullin and Mr. John L. White in
recent issues of the Ring-tum
Phi, I have investigated the
matter to determine the actual
amount paid to Stokely Car-
michael for his speech here at
Washington and Lee on January
28.

The total fee paid to Mr. Car-
michael was $345, which includ-
ed an honorarium of $300 and
travel expenses in the amount
of $45. Because the only figure
stated in print up to now has
been the highly inflated sum of
$2,000 given by Mr. Mullin, I
thought it was important for the
University community to be
aware of the actual amount. |
hope that this disclosure will
put the controversy to rest.

endorse and support the respon-

Association for Black Unity, as

well as all other campus
organizations, in sponsoring a

I certainly do not agree with
all positions advocated by the
many speakers who appear at
Washington and Lee each year,
but I defend their right to be
here and to express their opi-
nions in public forums. All of us
can learn from them.

Dear Editor:

David Mullin has achieved
the dubious distinction of
writing a rebuttal that was even
more offensive than his original
comments.

I wish Washington and Lee
had more black students. It is
quite probable that if more
blacks applied to W&L they
would be accepted and persons
of Mr. Mullin’s ilk would be re-

student body would accordingly

‘Endless Paternal Attacks On Our Social Life’

Dear Editor:

I am disappointed with the seemingly endless
paternal attacks on fraternity social life by our
professors and administrators. These attacks are
based upon the belief that the rights and privileges
of students can be manipulated to create activities
which would ‘‘complement, rather than conflict
with, the academic environment” at Washington
and Lee.

Although I can sympathize with the faculty’s
concern about the tendency students have towards
attending fraternity functions instead of studying
or participating in extracurricular events, I see
the faculty’s attempt to control student life as
detrimental to the ‘‘liberal’”’ environment a liberal
arts college is supposed to provide.

One professor claims that mid-week parties ‘‘go
counter to college.”’ I am extremely puzzled by
this attitude. Isn’t there more to college than
academics? Maybe mid-week parties do conflict
with the academic environment. But who ever
said that academics is the sole concern of a col-
lege?

Isn’t it a function of this college, or any college
for that matter, to develop a student’s awareness
of his strengths and weaknesses in order that he
can carry on a responsible life after graduation?
How can this be achieved if a student is not allow-
ed to discover for himself what his capabilities are
and where his limits lie?

By coercing the students against their will, the
university will not only create unnecessary con-
troversy, but create an environment in which a
student is unable to mature. This, in my opinion, is
“counter to college.” :

Contrary to what this professor believes, the
fact that one fraternity’s G.P.A. rose ten places
because it was put on social probation doesn’t
necessarily indicate that the rise was due to the

*

two-three week probation. The top nine frater-
nities do not vary tremendously with regard to
grade point average (2.6-2.8).

I would be curious to know how many of the
other eight were put on social probation? I know of
one fraternity which finished in the top five
without being placed on social pro.

For the sake of argument though, let’s assume
that a fraternity’s G.P.A. can be raised as a result
of social probation or any other ban on partying.
Should every fraternity be told by a surrogate
parent when to have parties and when not to?
Granted, social probation, except when carried to
the absurd (as it sometimes is), is a necessary
deterrent against actions such as hazing and
destruction of property.

But social probation, which in effect is what the
university is attempting to impose, as a punish-
ment for socializing rather than studying? Are we
going to a college or a prep school? As was said in
the Phi last week, the next thing that the faculty
will desire is study halls!

It strikes me as slightly hypocritical that a
university which prides itself on its liberal educa-
tion is punishing its students by the coercive bann-
ing of Wednesday night parties. What kind of
liberal education can be achieved if students are
not allowed to discover for themselves the path to
maturity they should take?

The activities which best complement the
academic life at college are those outside the
“ivory tower’ which develop a person’s capability
to know his potentialities, thus becoming a respon-
sible member of society. This capability will be
impaired if the paternal protection the faculty ex-
hibits over its students continues.

War is the health of the state.

It stimulates the economy and shifts public at-
tention away from the economic destruction
wreaked by government intervention, thereby
saving countless totalitarian laws and political
careers. War also gives government contracts to
favored businesses, thus keeping them artificially
afloat in the marketplace.

All of this sounds dubious enough, if not for the
fact that, at the point of a very large gun, innocent
individual human beings are forced to foot the bill
at the expense of their lives and property. This is
outright crime and ought to be eliminated, not sup-
ported and protected in the name of defending
freedom and ‘‘vital interests.’ Whose freedom?
Whose interests? Obviously not those ofthe
citizens who merely constitute the cannon fodder
in this activity. The purpose of this, then, must be
to protect the interests of those. businesses and
politicians who stand to gain in power,
‘‘prestige:’’ and ill-gotten wealth from these sor-
did affairs.

All of this brings us, of course, to Afghanistan
and the present manufactured American war-
hysteria. The criminal Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan was not an act of world conquest: it
was not an attempt to take over the oilfields. It
was merely a costly resort of desperation, after a
twenty-year sequence of bumbling intervention by
Russia in the unstable and often bloody
politic/religious affairs of Afghanistan—much
like our fiascoes in Viet Nam and Korea.

The Afghan army has been entirely equipped by
the USSR since 1954; the country’s government
has received over a billion dollars in aid, and
Russia has always been Afghanistan’s major
trading partner. In 1978, the small, communist
People’s Democratic Party (PDP) overthrew and
killed President Mohammed Daoud, a royal fami-
ly member and long time Soviet puppet.

The PDP, whose entire base of support con-
sisted of about 5,000 urban intellectuals in a rural
nation of 27 million, quickly staged massive
purges, executions and jailings in order to
establish control. Afghanistan and Russia im-
mediately signed a 20-year Treaty of Friendship
and Cooperation, and several thousand Soviet
economic and military “‘advisors’’ (remember
Vietnam? ) appeared on the scene.

From the outset, the new Afghan government
was plagued with internal opposition between two
major factions, the Masses Party and the Banner
Party. Soon the Masses Party succeeded in
ousting nearly all members of the Banner Party,
which was the most closely tied to the Soviet
Union. Russia intervened, attempting to juggle op-
posing factions, being concerned with the ‘‘stabili-
ty’’ of its interests.

The new coalition government immediately
launched into a series of forced revolutionary
reforms which aroused considerable popular
resistance. The attempt to impose a new social
order from the top down necessitated a police
state which cost the regime much support.
Political repression, Islamic reaction, and fear of
being sold out to the Russians fueled rebellion in
nearly all the provinces. The regime's drafted ar-
L my suffered desertions and mutinies. Soviet ad-

 

: Backstage Afghanistan

visors were attacked and often killed. Russia at-
tempted to oust and replace President Amin, who,
apparently, was too totaliarian for even the
Soviets, but failed in a bloody shoot-out in the
Presidential Palace.

Angered, Amin rejected all Soviet pleas for
friendship, charted an independent, hard-line
Marxist course, and continued to generate popular
hostility. Threatened by a massive Moslem upris-
ing like the one in Iran (generated similarly by the
U.S.), the Russians moved in to save face and
clean up their mess. Within two weeks, there were
50,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, the U.S. hadbeen cultivating similar
client regimes (like the Shah’s) in Turkey, Oman,
Somalia, and Egypt; it has been shipping millions
of dollars of military aid to Pakistan; the U.S.
defence budget is up 5% plus inflation per year;
recent curbs on the CIA are being reconsidered;
and draft registration is about to be imposed. It
seems, hypocritically, that the American govern-
ment is so impressed with the Soviet operations, it
is planning to imitate them.

All ‘of these developments, begun prior to the
Soviet invasion, along with the creation of a Rapid
Deployment Global Strike Force, makes it temp-
ting to suspect that the desperate Soviet interven-
tion in Afghanistan is being used as a pretext to br-
ing the state’s agenda for similar action to public
awareness. What with an economy crumbling
under the ravages of inflation, taxation, and
regulation; many corporate ‘‘friends-of-the-state”’
floundering on the brink of bankruptcy; and in-
creasing numbers of growingly restless, angry
and bitter young Americans who are unable to find
work because of minimum wage and licensing
laws—it is logical that the government would
welcome, indeed cultivate, any opportunity to
stimulate the economy, to bail out its business
friends with massive ‘‘defense’’ contracts, and to
draft the politically dangerous masses of
unemployed young people.

All this, as well as to generate that infamous
political panacea, hearty war fever, nationalism
and collectivized pride and outrage. In other
words, here we go again—

‘Realistically all wars have
been fought for economic

reasons. To make’ them
politically and_ socially
palatable, ideological issues

will always have been invoked.
Any possible future war will,
undoubtedly, conform to
historical precedent.’’—U.S. Of-
fice of Naval  Intelligence-
report to the president, 1938.

When our government begins utilizing such
criminal and totalitarian methods of violating
human rights that would make even Russia proud,
what position are we then in to justify our-
militarism in the name of ‘‘defending freedom?”
The main threat to American freedom and
capitalism if from within our own borders—our
renagade and criminal government.

Persiflage

Foul Play And Mexican Vacations

The Ring-tum Phi regrets
that there is no Persiflage this
week.

Percy claims that he’s too
emotionally disraught to crank

It seems that his parents were
killed in an unfortunate plane
accident and there is some
question as to whether there

was any foul play involved.

Percy says he'll resume his

companies drop their investiga-
tions and pay off the various
hundred thousand dollar
policies that he just happened to
take out before the flight.

Until that time, however, he

Ginsburg Responds

Dear Editor:

In the February 28 issue of the
Ring-tum Phi, Gary Goodenow,
C. Sawyer, and Ned McDonnell
felt compelled to ‘‘attack’’ me
on the issue of the removal of
unsigned posters. I would like to
clarify a few issues.

First, Goodenow claims the
degree of my having been of-
fended: ‘‘pales in in-
significance” in comparison to
my act. Announcements located
ina public place are a reflection
of this University community
and all its members. If the
views are not identified, they
may easily be mistaken for the
views of a larger segment of the
community then they, in reali-
ty, represent. These posters did
misrepresent a large number of
students, myself among them.
Had these views been signed, I
would have objected to their
content, but not necessarily
have removed them.

Secondly, I agree with Mr.
Sawyer’s assertion ‘‘posters at-
tached in a non-damaging man-
ner make possible a whole host
of necessary University func-

tions...’’ However, these posters
did not announce a forum to
discuss the issue, nor the forma-
tion of an organization to fur-
ther these views, nor did they
announce any type of Universi-
ty function. The authors of these
posters claimed they intended
to foster discussion of this
pressing issue within the com-
munity. They failed because the
only discussion is the exchange
in which I am currently par-
ticipating.

Thirdly, I would like to crush
the notion that these posters
were ripped down in any
organized group of hostile
students. The action was spon-
taneous.

Finally, I offer no apologies
because I owe no apologies. If
additional anonymous posters
appear in the future, if they
may be misconstrued to repre-
sent a disproportionate percen-

, tage of the community, I will

repeat my actions. Unsigned
posters of this nature are of no
more worth than unsigned graf-
fiti on bathroom walls.

Accolades For The
W&L Basketball Team

Dear Editor:

Although this sports year pro-
bably will be remembered na-
tionally as the year of the U.S.
Olympic hockey team, I will
remember it as the year of the
Washington and Lee basketball
team.

In my 18 years at the Univer-
sity, I have never been so proud
of an athletic team and its ef-
forts as I am of the players,
managers and coaches of this
year’s team.

I doubt seriously that any
other group of collegiate
athletes ever had to deal with so
severe a psychological blow as
that which befell this squad. I
am certain that no group has
ever accepted a challenge and
dealt with it more magnificent-
ly then did this one.

Winning the ODAC title was
frosting on the cake as far as I
am concerned since the team
had already proved to me that it
was comprised of winners.
Prior to the tournament, the
players had shown repeatedly
what they were made of as they

endured threats, taunts, and
poor home game attendance
while still battling every oppos-
ing team down to the last whis-
tle.

Of course, by winning the
tournament, the team was able
to exhibit to all who would take
notice that tremendous results
can be accomplished by dedica-
tion, hard work and excellent
coaching. How great it would be
if all those who graduate from
this institution could take away
the satisfaction of knowing
what inner resources they
poszess to the extent these fine
young men undoubtedly will.

Congratulations to the most
courageous basketball team in
the history of Washington and
Lee.

Proposal For A New Interfraternity

Jim Feinman

In my last column, I outlined the problem in the
present fraternity government with respect to the
IFC constitution. In summary, the present docu-
ment is meaningless because of the lack of any
valid goals, ideals or standards. Recognizing that
the largest problem at WAI. is the lack of a con-
structive and beneficial attitude among a large
number of fraternity members and other students,
I now present the outline for a new constitution.

Keep in mind that this is a general outline and is
not intended as a final draft.

PREAMBLE

We, the students of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, in order to form a fraternity system that is
constructive and beneficial to our society, that
promotes thought and the dispersion of ideas, and
that is conducive to the acquisition of the skills of
written and oral rhetoric, do establish this con-
stitution.

PROGRAMS

To realize the goals set forth in the preamble,
the following programs will be participated in by
all fraternity houses. POINT SYSTEM—This pro-
gram is to establish a competition between frater-
nities to see which house can accumulate the most
number of points in a semester. Points will be
tallied and recorded by a 16-man, one-man-from-
each-house, committee.

Points will be awarded for participation in ex-
tracurricular cultural, civic and athletic ac-
tivities. For example, for each member of a
iraternity that attends a Contact presentation, one
point will be awarded to his respective traternity.
Likewise for the Michael Miley photograph ex-

hibit, dance or drama productions, Republican
Club meetings, etc., etc.

Higher point values will be assignea tor par-
ticipation in activities that require more than a
one-night showing. For example, for each frater-
nity member that participates in the Rugby Club,
his fraternity will receive 10 points. Likewise for
actors in drama productions, officers of the
Republican Club, E.C. committee members, Ring-
tum Phi staff, etc., etc.

15 points will be awarded to a house for every :

member that participates in inter-collegiate
athletics as well as for each member that has a 2.5
average or better per semester. 20 points will be
assigned for members of a fraternity that par-
ticipaté in upper-level student government such as
E.C. members, Ring-tum Phi editor, Ariel editor,
Contact chairman, SAB chairman,etc., etc.

The purpose of this program is not to make peo-
ple involved in areas that they might not care to
participate in. The purpose is to encourage and
support people who participate and achieve in
areas that they are interested in.

The purpose of the tabloid is to promote thought
in the individual houses (which will be facillitated
by the pride involved when your house has its
turn) and to disperse ideas and _ thought
throughout the fraternity system and the com-
munity as well. Obviously, this program will also
be conducive to acquiring and strengthening the
skill of writing.

Substantial prizes will be awarded to the top
three houses in the point competition each
semester. However, to insure that each fraternity
actively participates, a minimum number of
points must be accumulated by each house per
semester. Several methods could be used to deter-
mine the minimum number of points. One way
would be to tabulate the total number of extracur-
ricular activities that occur on our campus. The
minimum point value each house must ac-
cumulate would be equal to the number of points a
house would receive if three members went to
each event. This does not mean that three

members of each house must attend each event.
The minimum point value can be reached by each
house by participating in whatever that house (or
its individual members) care to participate in.
For example, 40 points will be awarded to a house
if 40 members attend a Contact presentation, but
no members of that house will have to attend a
porcelain exhibit if they don’t care to.

Severe penalties will be in order for any house
that does not attain the minimum number of
points each semester. If a house fails to meet the
minimum, it will be required to do so for two suc-
cessive semesters. Failure to do this will result in
social probation for a semester.

A mathematical ratio will have to be assigned to
each house to determine the winners of the point
system for each semester. This is necessary
because each house does not have the same

number of members. an

TABLOID—The fraternity system will sponsor an
interfraternity tabloid consisting of one sheet of
paper folded to make four pages. The responsibili-
ty for editing, layout, printing and circulation will
be delegated to a 16-man, one-man-from-
eachhouse, committee. The responsibility for
writing the articles that will appear in the tabloid
will be rotated to each fraternity house. This
means that once every 32 weeks, your fraternity
will be responsible for writing the tabloid
material.

The format for the tabloid can be established in
any number of ways. One format could be totally
free style; the individual fraternity can write on
anything it chooses. Another format would be to
set a number of general topics and the articles
must address these topics in any manner the
fraternity chooses. For example, if Justice were a
general topic the articles could range from the
legalization of marijuana to the criminal code of
Lexington. If Energy were a general topic, the ar-
ticles could range from, well, the possibilities here
are limitless. If Politics were a topic, the articles
could range from serious support for a candidate
to satires of famous-or infamous-politicians.
INTERFRATERNITY DEBATE CIRCUIT—The
fraternity system will sponsor a debate tourna-
ment every semester. A 16-man, one-man-from-
each house, committee will be responsible for set-
ting the format, arranging the brackets and judg-
ing the competition.

There are several ways to set up the debate
competition. One way would be to require that

each fraternity field a three-man team. The first
round of debate would have no winners or losers.
Beginning the second round, a single-elimination
tournament would commence with substantial
prizes for the top four teams. Debate topics could
be extremely varied but should always be of con-
temporary concern and of general interest to the
student body. Attendance at the debates will be
awarded with one point under the point system.
INTERFRATERNITY COMMUNITY
COMMITTEE—The purpose of this committee
will be to initiate and carry out worthwhile com-
munity projects by the fraternity system as a
whole. Imagination and awareness on the part of
the 16-man, one-man-from-each-house, committee
will be necessary to facilitate this program. This
committee will make the initial plans for the
variety of community projects that are possible
and then delegate the responsibility for carry-out
the projects among all the fraternities.

‘ The diversity and number of community pro-
jects that can be performed by the fraternity
system as a whole is endless. Examples would be
blood drives, paper drives, book drives and
aluminum can drives. Many other projects are
possible. Fraternity members could be sent to the
area high schools to speak on the value of an
education, whether that education be high school
or college. This is an area that has been vastly ig-
nored in the past.

Again, the function of this committee will be to
look at our community to see what can and should
be done by the fraternity system to make a civic
contribution. This program will promote the
fraternities’ image in the community and will help
us all to be more civic-minded.

GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE—The purpose of this
16-man, one-man-from-each house committee will
be to provide a forum for fraternity members who
have a complaint aoout anything in our communi-
ty. The committee will hear complaints and
research the problem if it sees the need. After
researching and discussing the problem, the com-
mittee, if it chooses, will be able to present a state-
ment directed to the appropriate authority in an
effort to alleviate the problem. The statement will
be considered as representative of the fraternity
system as a whole.

This would be an example of how this committee
would work: Joe Student has a complaint so he
calls the committee to make an appointment for
the next committee meeting. Joe goes to the
meeting and addresses the committee. ‘“My com-
plaint is that while this school is named after Gen.
Washington and Gen. Lee, very few people here
know much about the beliefs, values or ideals of
these men—unless they learned it before they got
here. I think this is a shame because these men
were great leaders—renaissance men of their day.
I think an interdepartmental history-philosophy
course would be very interesting and of interest to
a large number of students. Can this committee
look into this?”’

The committee would decide whether or not to
pursue this problem. If they decided to, they would
research it and ascertain if a statement is
necessary. If this was determined, the committee
could present a suggestion (as strongly worded as
they saw fit) to the faculty requesting that such a
course be established.

This committee would give fraternities and
their members a forum for whatever grievance
they might have. It could conceivably make the
fraternity system an interest group of con-
siderable strength.

This is the end of the program section of the pro-
posed constitution, These programs are offered as
guidelines for the large number of possibilities in this

area. The following section will deal with many
diferent areas of concern,

DISCIPLINE

Preface—(The disciplinary bodies presently in
authority are extremely shackled in thead-
ministration of justice throughout the fraternity
system. This is due to the lack of a written code to
guide the judicial board. It is also due to an inter-
pretation that the judicial board can only
discipline fraternities as a whole and not in-
dividual members. I would like to note that I can-
not find the specific phrase in the existing con-
stitution that makes this interpretation possible.

Another. area of concern in relation to the pre-
sent disciplinary problem is the number of deci-
sions that are reviewed by the Student Affairs
Committee and deemed unacceptable. In effect,
this means that the present disciplinary body may
not have performed its function at times. )

The judicial branch of the new constitution will
be able and effective in disciplining fraternities as
a whole and individual members as well. There
will be a written code of conduct that all frater-
nities must adhere to. Also, there will be a written
code of conduct that all fraternity members must
adhere to. A code of conduct for individuals is
necessary because the new judicial board will not
consider fraternity membership a right. Fraterni-
ty membership will be considered a privilege,
therefore all members must conduct themselves
in a civilized and gentlemanly manner—and be
held accountable if they don’t.

The new judicial board will be made up of a 16-
man, one-man-from-each-house, committee. The
IFC president will serve as chairman of the com-
mittee. The function of this board will be to hear
all cases of alledged misconduct by fraternities or
members. Judgments made by this board will be
consistent with and guided by the written codes of
conduct. Penalties administered will rarely in-
volve monetary fines. Penalties will be based on
the assignment of constructive work projects con-
sistent with the severity of the misconduct of each
case.

In the case of disciplining individual members
of fraternities, the board will give the fraternity
involved the opportunity to discipline its own
members. All judgments made by individual
fraternities will be subject to review by the board.
If the judgment is deemed satisfactory by the
judicial board, that body will ensure that the guil-
ty party fulfills the requirements of the penalty .|If
the judgment is deemed unsatisfactory by the
judicial board, that body may overrule and ad-
minister justice in a manner consistent with the
written codes of conduct.

All cases handled by the judicial board will be
subject to review by the SAC. Cases where the
SAC intervenes should, ideally, be non-existent. In
reality, such cases will be extremely rare because
the fraternity system will be able to govern itself
in a manner that is constructive and beneficial to
society in accordance with the written codes of
conduct.

A sub-committee of the judicial board will be set
up to investigate cases of alledged misconduct in-
volving female visitors to our campus. This is
necessary due to the alarming number of women
at the surrounding colleges who will no longer visit
W&L because of incidents in the past where they
were abused, tormented or treated in an otherwise
ungentlemanly manner. The stance of this sub-
committee will be that such conduct is by a
minority of fraternity members and is in no way
condoned by the vast majority. This sub-
committee will give females the opportunity for
redress is they feel they have been mistreated;
publicity to that effect will be dispersed at each
campus. This committee will strengthen W&L’s
image at the surrounding colleges and will result
in an increase of female visitors to our campus.

RUSH
The new constitution will administer rush in the

== same way it is administered now with one excep-

tion. Rush will be held in the winter semester. This

Bis necessary due to the present misplacement of

priorities among the freshmen in the beginning of
the year. Rush in the winter will enable freshmen
to have a better opportunity to get off to a good
start in their academic careers. Rush in the winter
will also enable some upperclassmen to get off toa
better start in the beginning of the school year.

A 16-man, one-man-from-each-house, commit-
tee will be established to create opportunities for
freshmen to meet as many of the upperclassmen
as possible during the fall semester. There are
many ways to do this. One way would be to have
freshmen eat at different houses on a rotating
basis. Another way would be to start a car-pool
program. This program would allow freshmen to
sign up for rides going-down-the-road. Fraternity
members will notify the car-pool program as to
where and when they are going down the road and
how many freshmen they can take. Freshmen will
then be assigned rides on a first-come-first-served
basis.

Another function of this committee will be to
make sure that any activities that could be con-
strued as ‘“‘rushing’’ do not take place until the
winter semester.

HAZING

All forms of hazing that are physically or men-
tally abusive will be outlawed under the new con-
stitution. These forms of hazing will be replaced
by (an equally degrading, equally demeaning,
form of hazing—but one) activities serve a con-
structive and beneficial service to our community.

This new form of “‘hazing”’ will take place under
the auspices of a 16-man, one-man-from-each-
house, committee. The members of this commit-
tee should be of similar character and tempera-
ment as the current pledgemasters.

One of the responsibilities of this committee will
be to administer a ‘“‘What’s Happening”’ program.
This program will work in this manner: Any
organization in or around our community that
desires to have publicity on our campus will phone
or write the committee and give them the what,
where, when, who, etc. that it desires to be
publicized. The committee will then organize the
pledges to begin the creation, printing and circula-
tion of the necessary publicity material. For ex-
ample, if Sen. Warner is going to speak in Lee
Chapel on a given night, the pledges will create,
print, and distribute flyers and posters that con-
tain all the necessary information. In addition,
pledges will make sandwich signs with similar in-
formation and take turns wearing and parading
them along the collonade and in town on the day
the Senator will speak.

This program will single out pledges to do
something that no one else will have to do. It will
make them the subject of some good-natured teas-
ing and at times, it may even embarrass them.
But while the pledges are the subject of such
humiliation, they will be performing a valuable
service to our community and to themselves. The
pledges will have a much better idea of what is go-
ing on around our campus because they will have
to tell the rest of us; and we will have a better idea

The Ring-tum Phi, March 6, 1980, Page 15

of what is happening on campus because some for-
cibly ostentatious pledge will be telling us.

In addition to the ‘“‘What’s: Happening”’ pro-
gram, the upperclass committee will be responsi-
ble for creating and printing several pledge
manuals that all pledges will have to read. To in-

sure that the pledges master the material in these
manuals, tests will be administered and a passing
grade will have to be obtained or the pledge will be
subject to an oral review of the material. If a
pledge does not satisfy the reviewing committee,
he will be assigned extra duty on the ‘‘What’s Hap-
pening” program.

The content of the pledge manuals will be of con-
temporary concern and interest. Examples would
be the Honor Code, the qualities of a gentleman,
and the dangers of venereal diseases. Another
good example would be mental health. This
manual could cover everything from alcohol and
drug abuse to sexual problems to manic-
depression. Again, the possibilities for construc-
tive pledge manuals are limitless.

SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS

Social restrictions in the proposed constitution
will be limited to two requirements. Fraternities
and individual members will have to conduct
themselves in accordance to the written codes of
conduct and applicable Lexington ordinances will
have to be adhered to. Otherwise there will be no
social restrictions or regulations of any kind. The
reasoning behind this is that if this proposed con-
stitution is adopted, the fraternities and their
members will be conducting themselves in a man-
ner that is constructive and beneficial to our socie-
ty. When this occurs there will be no reason to, or
anyone who will be able to, dictate or control the
social habits of the fraternities or their members.

HOUSING RESTRICTIONS

Housing restriction or regulation will be limited
under the proposed constitution. A regular inspec-
tion by a team of students, with faculty and fire
marshall guidance, will be made to insure the
safety of the houses with respect to fire hazards
and other potential dangers. The appearance and
cleanliness of the houses will be left to the discre-
tion of the individual houses and members. The
reasoning behind this is the same as for the social
restrictions.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF HOUSE OFFICERS

Under the proposed constitution, house officers
will have considerably more responsibility than
they have now. House officers will have to adhere
to and support the constitution and will be respon-
sible for encouraging as many individuals as
possible to participate in the various programs. In
addition, officers will work closely with all the
representatives who serve on the constitutional
committees.

House officers will also be responsible for
leading the members of their houses in creating
and maintaining the type of constructive and
beneficial house atmosphere that is consistent
with the ideals and principles of the constitution.

This is the end of the guideline for the proposed
constitution. The many advantages that we would
reap by adopting such a constitution are too
numerous to name in the already generous
amount of space which I have been allotted. The
major disadvantage would be the establishment of
a rather large bureacracy. However, it can be
argued that the world is a huge bureacracy and
that is we create our owr, perhaps we will be
prepared to do a better job in the future than is
presently being done in this area.

What will it take to adopt the proposed constitu-
tion? Primarily, it will take a large effort by a
large number of people. Enough of us will have to
look at what we have now and decide that we can
have something better. Enough of us will have to
decide that it is time to concentrate our efforts and
energy towards things that are constructive and
beneficial to us all. It enough of us decide that we
can, then we will. If enough of us decide that we
can’t, then we won't.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Please feel free to call me if you have any ques-
tions, comments or ideas.

Vote For Amendment

Dear Editor:

An amendment to the Student
Body Constitution is to be voted
on Monday. The amendment
calls for the raising of the
minimum balance for the Stu-
dent Body Reserve Fund from
its present level of $2,500 to
$4,000.

Tenure
Problems
Nationwide

(continued from page 1)

teaching, research and service.

Teachers who have _ been
denied tenure are beginning to
take their grievances to court—
generally with little success.

Last September, two former
assistant professors of English
at the University of Maryland
at College Park lost a suit in
federal court in which they
charged they had been denied
tenure unfairly. -

In another court case, a
federal judge in July, 1977,
overruled a jury award of
$180,000 to a tenured associate
German professor at Goucher
College who had sued the school
for dismissing her.

Although most educators
staunchly defend tenure as a
proven system for developing
and rewarding top-notch
teachers, one school in Mary-
land recently scrapped the idea.
In 1971, St. Mary’s College, a
small liberal arts school, in-
stituted a system of five-year
contracts with review instead of
hiring new faculty members
under the tenure program.

But St. Mary’s is only one of a
few schools in the country that
have shelved tenure and the
College’s President J. Renwick
Jackson concedes that the
number is not likely to grow.

“‘T don’t think that most peo-
ple think they can eliminate
tenure. As a way of bonding
faculty members to an institu-
tion, it’s a fine system,”
Jackson said.

The Reserve Fund provides
the necessary financial security
for Student Body organizations.
If a group receiving Student
Body Funds ends its yearly
operations with a deficit, the
Reserve Fund is emploved to
eradicate this problem. This
has occurred in the past, and as
a result of spiralling inflation,
$2,500 is no longer a safe or
viable Reserve Fund.

The proposal to raise the
Reserve Fund would not cause
an increase in the Student Ac-
tivities Fee, by itself, nor would
it result in any organization
receiving less funding.

In order for this amendment

’ to pass half of the Student Body

must cast ballots with twe-
thirds of those favoring adop-
tion of the amendment.

The Executive Committee
unanimously supports this pro-
posed amendment and urges
the entire Student Body to vote
yes for the amendment on Mon-
day.

The reason for this is that all the teams involved
tend to give the best performances they are capable
