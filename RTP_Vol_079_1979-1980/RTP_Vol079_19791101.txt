Lambda Chi Fined
For Kidnapping

by John Billmyre

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council fined
Lambda Chi Alpha $150 Tues-
day night for- kidnapping a
freshman from the Graham-
Lees dormitory on Friday, Oct.
26.

Members of Lambda Chi
waited almost an hour before
the Judicial Board reached a
decision, issued a statement on
kidnapping and fined the frater-
nity.

“The IFC Judicial Board does
in no way condone kidnapping.
Kidnapping that causes mental
and/or physical harm or in-
terferes with school work will
not be considered a legitimate
activity and will be dealt with
on an individual basis,”’ read
Secretary Sam Perkins when
Lambda Chi representatives
returned to the room.

Syd Farrar, IFC President,
noted that the kidnapping did
not harm the freshman or keep
him from doing work, but said
that freshmen are not to be
removed from the dorms.

After being removed from the
dorm, the freshman was driven
around town, given beer to
drink and left on a university
playing field.

During the Judicial Board
hearing representatives of
Lambda Chi, including IFC
Treasurer Hunt Shuford, stress-
ed that Lambda Chi’s house
policy prohibits kidnapping and

Vandalism And

by Sam Campbell
Many recent acts of burglary
and vandalism have been at-
tributed to Lexington area
juveniles.
A juvenile has been arrested
- in the theft of a student’s

that the kidnapping was an in-
dividual effort.

Shuford said the policy was
posted in a two-page letter in
the house. .

Representatives indicated the
three individuals responsible
for the kidnapping will pay the
fine.

A precedent for the case was
set last year when Sigma Chi
was fined $150 for leaving a
freshman on the Blue Ridge
Parkway in his underwear.

Farrar said that the Judicial
Board will not tolerate kidnapp-
ing or hazing.

Hazing
Dorm counselors’ were
recently issued letters requir-
ing them to report any possible
cases of hazing, broadly defined
as physical and/or mental
abuse.

Farrar said paddling, hosing
with water, kidnapping, ‘‘dum-
ping on,’’ forced drinking bouts
and forced sitting in ice water
are considered hazing and will
not be tolerated.

He added, ‘“‘the Student Af-
fairs Committee might view
hazing differently than the IFC.

“If you do haze, it is more
than likely that someone will
come down hard on you,”’ Far-
rar said to IFC representatives
during the regular meeting.

This Weekend

Country rock bands Stillwater
and Boot Hill Express will play
Sunday at a Student Activities
Board concert at the pavillion.

The mixer will be from 2 un-
till six Sunday afternoon. The
SAB plans to have 30 kegs for
the party. Beer will be free.

Admission is $2 in advance
and $3 at the door for W&L
students and $3 in advance and
$5 at the door for non-students.
Tickets are on sale at the Co-op,
Flip Side Records, and are
available from any SAB
member.

 

Bands To Play

Both bands offer high energy
Southern rock and country
rock. Stillwater, who opened for
C-Level this summer, has two
albums on the market and has
been receiving a lot of air play
and attention.

Boot Hill Express, who was
on the W&L campus during
Rush, hails from Virginia
Beach, where it has played to
packed houses in the more
popular bars there. The band
features a female vocalist who
sings many Linda Ronstadt
songs and a peddle steel guitar.

EC Changes Cold Check Rule

by Joe Scott
The Executive Committee
authorized the Cold Check Com-
mittee to extend its bad check
stautute of limitations to two
years at Monday night’s EC
meeting.

The move could substantially
increase penalties for habitual
offenders with a graduated fine
scale rising with the number of
offenses.

“Raising the statute of limita-
tions to two years would make

Three juveniles were ar-
rested on charges of robbery at
the Phi Gamma Delta fraterni-
ty house of Oct. 23. Whiskey,
money, billfolds and a watch
were stolen. The watch and
billfold have been recovered in
the incident.

On Oct. 24, a student reported
thata pong key had been stolen
from his front porch.

Bill Brock, a resident of the
East Nelson Street Apartments,
told police that someone had set
fire to his pumpkin on the back

porch. While Brock was putting ©

the fire, thieves removed the
keg from his front porch.

Brock was hosting. a small
gathering at the time of the
theft. The invesitgating officer
said that the only thing left was
“the ice around the keg.”’

Another student saw a keg be-
ing transferred to a car near the
place of robbery. The invesitga-
tion is continuing.

people think more about
floating checks,’’ said CCC
Treasurer Mike Malesardi, ad-
ding that a student’s third of-
fense would bring him before
the Student Control Committee.

Jim Vines, CCC Chairman,
said he was opposed to the two
year limit and in favor of rais-
ing the time limit to four years.

The 9-2 vote legalizes the new
rule which will go into effect
Nov. 1.

The CCC was also given per-
mission to withdraw up to $100
from the EC Reserve Fund at
any time during the week.
Previously the loan request had
to be submitted at the EC’s
regular Monday meeting.

“The $100 is a_ safety
cushion,”’ said Vines. “It would
keep the money_from coming
out of my pocket.” The reason
for the money, Vines said, was
to act as a safeguard against
checks bouncing that were writ-
ten to the CCC by bad check of-
fenders.

During the normal course of
operations checks sometimes
come pouring in, said Vines. He
added that “for the first two
months of school, we have had
$700 worth of bad checks,” a
figure much higher than before.

The motion, receiving
unanimous EC _ approval,
stipulated that the money tran-
saction could only be made bet-
ween Vines and EC Vice Presi-
dent Les Cotter and that the
loan would only be given if the
committee’s checking account
ran below $100. The loan must
be repaid within a month.

During the CCC’s monthly

report, Vines said they have
already received responses
from students, now out of Lex-
ington, about the letter EC at-
torney Thomas Spencer wrote
asking that bad checks be reim-
bursed within 10 days. Spencer
will receive one-third of the
recovered revenue for his ser-
vices.

The Student Activities Board
gave its monthly report outlin-
ing all entertainment expen-
ditures and noted that film
receipts hovered $434 over ex-
penses for October. SAB Co-
Chairman David Harpole added
that they will pick out some
more expensive films for the
winter.

EC President Steve Abraham
questioned the $44 projectionist
charge saying that his impres-
sion was that the service was
free. SAB Co-Chairman Bill
Ridge noted the Sunday night
showings conflicted with SAB
meetings and that the projec-
tionist was being paid $3.00 per
hour. Harpole said the SAB had
discussed the projectionist pro-
blem, had a ‘‘scolding session,”’
and now seemed to have all
under control.

Plans for Sunday’s Pavillion
party were detailed by the SAB.
Tickets for the party—featuring
Stillwater and_ Boothill
Express—will be sold at the
door and the Co-op. The party
runs from 2-6 p.m. and includes
30 kegs of Budweiser.

The Ring-tum Phi’s financial
statement during their monthly
report showed higher subscrip-
tion revenues. “I think it’s

Cockpit To Get Giant TV

by Jim Feinman

Whether you are looking for a
nice place to take a date or just
want to watch the ball game
with the boys, the Cockpit is an
ideal choice.

The Cockpit, located on the
first floor of the University
Center, has always been a good
spot to take a date and soon, it
will be an even nicer place to
watch the game. Gerald Dar-
rell, manager of the Cockpit,
announced this week that a five-
and-a-half foot wide screen
television will be installed by
the beginning of next week. The
television will be used to watch
sporting events and movies.
This new addition should be
well-received by the student
community.

With the addition of the wide
screen T.V., the Cockpit will be
one of the nicest entertainment
rooms in town. The spacious
facility is well-equipped with
tables, booths and a bar. Hot
and cold sandwiches are served
along with a variety of
beverages, including beer. A
soup and salad bar is often
featured as a luncheon special.

Darrell, who has been respon-
sible for the Cockpit for the past
three years, has strived to
create an alternative to frater-
nity membership as_ the
primary source of student
entertainment at W&L. It is
well known that the social op-

portunities for a student who
does not wish to join a fraternity
are rather limited on campus as
well as in Lexington. Darrell
has tried to fill this void. Bands
appear frequently and feature
length movies are scheduled
often in the Cockpit.

Darrell feels that his efforts
are beginning to appeal to
students. He explains: ‘‘For
years there was a certain
stigma attached to the Cockpit.
For whatever reason, people
didn’t think anything was done
down there. Now, we're trying
to build up the business as a stu-
dent tavern. This would be an
alternative to fraternity parties
or going down the road. We
want to bring the road here.”

When Darrell says he wants
to bring the road here he means
it. Beer was half-priced for any
girl fron an area college for the
first month of school.

Greg Dyer, a senior accoun-
ting major from Bethesda, Md.,
Speaks well of the Cockpit. “‘It’s
a convenient place to relax
after studying. The beer is cold
and the burgers are hot. It was
a lot of fun watching the Series
in there, until the Birds started
losing.”

Darrell stresses the fact that
the Cockpit is managed for
students and relies heavily on
them for business. ‘‘Because
Washington and Lee is a non-
profit organization, and we are

a university facility, we do not
compete with the restaurants or
bars in town. Our only advertis-
ing is in the student newspaper
or on campus. Without the stu-
dent business we couldn’t func-
tion,”’ he explains.

If cold beer and good music is
the key to attracting students,
the Cockpit should not have
much trouble. Several _per-
formers have appeared in the
Cockpit already this year. The
All-Stars, a rock group from
Charlottesville, entertained a
packed house two weeks ago
and are expected to return in
the future.

Some of the bands that ap-
pear in the Cockpit are funded
by the tavern. However,
because the Cockpit is primari-
ly for students, the University
Center Committee also spon-
sors bands in the Cockpit. This
helps to make an active enter-
tainment calendar for the
tavern

Jamie Small, chairman of the
U.C.C. explains how his com-
mittee functions. ‘“‘We have
about $2,300 a semester in our
budget that goes for entertain-
ment in the Cockpit. The way it
usually works is a student will
approach us with a band that is
available for a certain date and
we have to make a decision on
whether the band is good
enough. We have an open
meeting at 7:00 p.m. every
Monday night in the Cockpit
and we urge students to attend.
We desire student input.’’

As the percent of freshmen
that join fraternities drops
across the nation and at
Washington and Lee, the
Cockpit will be looked to as a
source of entertainment in-
creasingly more in the future.
The way Darrell is running the
Cockpit, it doesn’t look as if
students should have much
trouble finding something to do.

SAC Imbalance Discussec

by Alan Kendrick

A proposal to correct an im-
balance of votes on the Student
Affairs Committee was brought
before the University Council
meeting yesterday afternoon.

Tim Brooks, one of the five
student members of SAC,
declared that the administra-
tion had had a 5-4 advantage in
SAC, voting when Dean Huntley
could not attend, while no stu-
dent voted for head dormatory
counselor Dan Carrucci, who
has been unable to attend a
single meeting this term due to
a schedule conflict.

Brooks proposed that a per-
manent student alternative be
selected from vice-presidents of
the represented committees.

After some debate, an alter-'

native motion was _ intoduce:
and passed to bar any voting i
place of regular members of th
SAC.

Changes in the academi:
calendar to be acted on at th:
next Faculty EC meeting wer
endorsed by the UC. Thre
changes were effected in th
new calendar:

(Freshmen orientation wil
start six days later, or Tuesday
of the week following Labo:
Day, and extend six days in
stead of the present seven)
Classes will begin on Monday
two weeks after Labor Day
This will hopefully relieve pro
fessors of the inconvenient
basis for making weekly plans
The examination schedule wil.
return to the normal plan
beginning on Saturday after
noon.

In Memoriam

Hiland

Newton
Moore

1959-1979

Society is a recurring topic in many of Hike’s
literary efforts. He questioned the sanctity of society
and dared to cut across its grain. The following poem
was written by Hike in December of 1978.

Hike Moore was raised in Lynchburg, Va. He
graduated from E.C. Glass High School, and in the
fall of 1977 he enrolled in Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. He loved to play frisbee in the street and soccer
in the hall. He enjoyed golf and was a member of
Oakwood Country Club. He was a Parkway driver
who toured the Blue Ridge with his friends on sunny
afternoons and starry nights.

Society

Downstairs there is no music

No voice of sweet pleasure.

But there is society, as silent as hell;
[hear it, yet physically it is not there.

Hike was a persistent person, whether studying or

at a party, he gave it his all. He had a nucleus of close:
friends, whome he cared a great deal for. One of’
Hike’s most outstanding qualities was his literary
ability. He was an avid reader and spent a large por-
tion of his time composing poetry and writing short
stories. In his writing he displayed a great sense of
perception and a high degree of sensitivity for the
world he lived in. He forced himself to see, feel and
articulate the inconsistencies and failures of our
society.

Now give mea bottle, a joint or a toot.

Let me imagine a solitude in this house,

No sunshine seeps through my window,

Like its acquaintance, it has crossed the
street.

Do I dare kill a relative, or spill my wine;
Shall I get arrested, or attend church without
a tie?

No one will hear me, but society will tell.

That wicked gossip, as silent as hell.

 

Hike Moore’s poetry will be
featured in the fall edition of
Ariel in December.

 

 

 

The rumor will fly, wetting many a tongue,

So wretched an act—I knew his parents well,
He came from such a fine family—stocks and
bonds you know,

But of course they’re not members here, they
belong to the public club.

Two weeks ago Hike wrote a poem entitled ‘‘Chang-
ing Leaves.’’ This poem describes a late-night trip he
and a companion took to the Parkway.

Changing Leaves

Society ran its trap, caught the news before
the press,

No one said a word, the buzz went away.
There was no solitude that society refused to
accept.

So I shot myself, alone, while all of society
slept.

Stand on a mountain peak

dawn rising up on one corner
darkness fading down the other
We stood, just we

mothers wailed as their calfs fed.

Empty streets fill

up with laughter in darkness
Casually we stroll,

One hand in your pocket,

the other catching Stars!

The city dissipates.

The trees laughed to see it gone.
Then turned a piercing glance
Toward Katherine’s Knob.

We stood, We embraced and stood
And casually smiled,

Then laughed at the rising sun.
One hand ina pocket

The other catching stars.

The death of Hike Moore should force us all to stop
and examine the world we live in. Should we redefine
our values, are we searching for whatever it is in life
that is truly important? Can we learn to love and to be
loved—for human’s sake alone? The following poem
was written by a member of Hike’s family.

Dear Hike

You saw society
at tea
at cocktail buffet.
You chose not to join
should we?
Words for the living
the surviving herd
Society can as we will
Society will as we allow
We—Society
Dear Hike

Sinister cat-eyes took out
The laughter. We stopped.
But laughed at the darkness.
We took out the dullness.
You and I.

Laughter.

Vincents’ red night

Fired out.

Vincents’ final plight

cast down in laughter.

One was scared

One was cas’

It’s time to put the capsules out,

Hold me warm and make the morning sprout.

Till the time capsules sprout
Hold me in darkness

See the topaz

Be blinded by

The Technicolor rainbow
And laugh!

Mock Convention Report

Republican Director Addresses State Chairmen

Hold me warm

Hold me in darkness
Blind me.

Know the laughter

in my Technicolor eyes!

 

 

The director of Local Elec-
tions for the Republican Na-
tional Committee addressed a
group of State Chairmen for
W&L’s Mock Republican Con-
vention Oct. 25.

Joe Gaylord, head of the divi-
sion of the Republican Party
responsible for targeting impor-
tant state and local election con-
tests, spoke on procedures for
the Republican National Con-
vention, the relative im-
portance of primaries and state
caucuses, and national conven-
tion psychology.

Mr. Gaylord shared his wide
experience and knowledge of
Conventions with the state
chairmen. He held important
positions at the 1968, 1972, and
1976 Republican National Con-
ventions. In 1976 he served as
executive director for the Rules
Committee, one of most power-
ful and prestigious committees,
and is expected to be named to a
similar position for the 1980
Convention.

Mr. Gaylord told the group

how a convention is organized,
beginning with the naming of
committees on arrangements,
contests, and credentials, rules,
resolutions (platform), and per-
manent organization.

He explained why the
Republicans chose Detroit as
the convention city over other
contenders, which included
Dallas and New Orleans
(Detroit and its recently com-
pleted Renaissance Center pro-
vided the the best facilities and
demonstrated that’ the
Republican Party wasn’t aban-
doning Northern urban areas).

About two-thirds of the states
will hold presidentail primaries
in 1980 while the remainder will
have state-wide caucuses and
conventions. The latter group
proves more difficult to
research. Mr. Gaylord in-
dicated that governors and
other state-wide officeholders
usually wield the power in these
non-primary states.

Discussion of changes in par-
ty rules and election laws pro-

vided the state chairmen with a
great deal of information. For
example, Mr. Gaylord main-
tained that in the Illinois
primary, delegate slates will
not be listed with the name of
the candidate they intend to
support. This means that II-
linois voters will not know
which dandidate they are
casting their vote for unless
they know the persons running
for delegate positions. The ef-
fect: people will vote for the
names they recognize, meaning
state-wide elected officials
most of whom are supporting
John Connally.

An issue Mr. Gaylord believes
will return to the forefront in
1980 is the so-called ‘‘16-C ques-
tion” where a presidential can-
didate would be forced to name
his running mate before the
convention balloting begins.

It was precisely this issue
that Ronald Reagan used to
challenge Gerald Ford in 1976
after Reagan had named Penn-
sylvania Senator Richard

Schweiker as his running mate.
Reagan is thought to be par-
ticularly interested in the “‘16-C
question’ because of the belief
that he is too old to be president.
But on the other hand, Mr.
Gaylord pointed out the dilem-
na a candidate might face if he
is asked to abandon his cam-
paign and become a vice
presidential candidate before
the convention.

The Illinois primary, the
ninth primary in 1980, will be
held on March 18 and Mr.
Gaylord said he believes that
this will be the last primary for
several contenders. The can-
didates worth particular atten-
tion, according to Mr. Gaylord:
Reagan, Connally Baker, Bush,
and Dole.

Mr. Gaylord said that Philip
Crane is more interested in the
1984 election and Congressman
John Anderson was simply try-
ing to prevent the Republican
Party from excluding its
moderate and liberal wings.

Hamlet Triumphs In Troubadour

by Parker Potter

Lee Kahn’s Hamlet, playing
in the Troubadour Theater
through Saturday, is a triumph
beyond all possible expecta-
tions. The entire cast and crew
of this sumptuous production
cannot be praised too highly.

Shakespeare is always a dif-
ficult assignment and Hamlet is
one of Shakespeare’s longest
and most complex plays. Given
these difficulties as well as the
limitations one should expect in
a small school drama depart-
ment, the prospect of Hamlet in
the Troub was a frightening
one.

And I’m here to say that
Kahn’s Hamlet isn’t just good
by W&L standards, it is a fine
production by any standards

The key to the success of the
play is Kahn’s direction. The
degree to which the entire cast
has integrated language and
meaning, words and actions, is
breathtaking. Kahn’s
characters, and in particular
Grant Kunkowski’s Hamlet,
don’t recite lines; rather they
live and breath the poetry of
passionately living people.

Perhaps the real hallmark of
this production is the seeming
ease with which the whole thing
is carried off. Everyone who ap-

Benefit Concert

pears on stage, from the prin-
ciples down through the
messengers, looks and sounds
comfortable in the
Elizabethean idiom. Which br-
ings me to the next point.

The decision to do Hamlet in
traditional dress with
Shakespeare’s language was a
sound one indeed. The cast’s
mastery of the language
meshes with the impeccable
costuming both of which in turn
work along with Tom Eiegier’s
intelligently and imaginatively
conceived set to make the
Troubador stage truly and com-
pletely the world of
Shakespeare’s Hamlet. And
that world is well peopled.
Grant Kunkowski’s Hamlet is a
performance of which any actor
could be proud. So complete is
his command of the language
that we don’t ever see the strug-
gle of an actor in a difficult
part—we see the torments of
Hamlet writ on Kunkowski’s
face. Kunkowski’s movements
on the stage, the way he gives
over every fiber of himself to
Hamlet is superb.

However, we are prepared for
Kunkowski’s masterful Hamlet
by Stan Nolan and Kurt Kam-
merer as Bernardo and Horatio
in the opening moments of the
play. These two, in the early go-

ing, don’t shout chunks of
Shakespeare at each other,
rather they make of
Shakespeare’s poetry the con-
versation it was always meant
to be.

Terry Frankenberger and
Beth Kahn as the King and
Queen of Denmark work well.
Frankenberger in particular br-
ings a certain needed loud
flashiness to the regal, but
greasy Claudius. His pomposity
is exactly that of a man at the
head of a train of such crazed
courting as his.

David Jones and Nelson Ould
as Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern a.k.a. Chip and
Dale, along with Rob Davis’
Polonius are both diverting and
informative. Most importantly,
these three actors have con-
structed complete and unified
characters, not the usual light
figures who wilt after a suc-
cessful bit of mugging.

Sherry Moore distinguishes
herself as Ophelia. She handles
with ease the range of emotions
required of her and really.
shines at the end when she is
deranged by the death of her
father. As her brother Laertes,
Frank Billingsly turns in a
solid, sincere performance.

rooted deeply in traditional folk
music, and when revived by
their personal interpreations,
prove most entertaining.

Rohr’s original songs possess
unique story-telling ability
coupled with his rich warm
voice, and Datz’s_ tasty
background licks offer many
listening delights. And when
these boys play an instrumen-
tal, it goes through the wash
and comes out spanking clean!

A one dollar cover charge will
be collected at the door and pro-

short of mesmerizing, as a

A word must be said about the
close of the play. One of
Shakespeare’s most monumen-

couldn’t have been played bet-

rarely has been played better

At the outset of the play I was
tremendously impressed with
the way it came out of the

wonder when the wheels would
come off. They never did. The
mood was a harmonious >* the

beginning.

Lee Kahn and his cast have
achieved a stunning dramatic
achievement. Period.

 

Record Review

 

by Mark Kinniburgh

A strange new sound has
begun to settle in the U.S. Some
call it a combination of David
Bowie, Brian Eno, Kraftweck
and Ultravox, but those who
know call it Gary Norman and
the Tubeway Army.

The band consists of Gary
Norman and various other folks
who happen to suit the music
mood of the hour. Gary Norman
does all the pre-production
work, all engineering coordina-
tion and plays guitars,
keyboards and all modes of syn-
thesizer.

The current U.S. exposure of
Gary Norman is_ the
albumReplicas with the song
“Are Friends Electric?’ The
entire album was _ recorded
while Norman was involved in
the production of blue-hean
commercials in England, and it
is in England that he is an un-
qualified star.

In the middle of July of this
year, the albumReplicas and the
single ‘‘Are Friends Electric?’’
were at the top of the British
album and single charts. Only
10 weeks later, he repeated his
feat with the albumPleasure
Principle and single ‘‘Cars.”’

The music is the big draw
with Gary Norman, as he is only
now beginning to tour the U.K.
in anticipation of an early 1980
tour of the United States. The
music then, is future rock-

 

synthesizer oriented with a

Gary Norman’s Sound

good does of paranoid lyrics
about robots, clones,
dehumanization and the aspects
of a gloomy high tech future.

The music of Gary Norman is
easily misunderstood, as is his
own personal manner which
borders on schizophrenic. All
this contributes to a rise in
public interest toward him, and
in translation, record sales.

At 21, Gary Norman is very
young to have been the holder of
two gold albums and singles,
but he is not a novice at the
record business. After signing
his first contract, he said “‘If I’d
started playing the stuff I do
now, I’d never got anywhere.
Get signed, and then you’re in
and can do what you want.”’
Replicas is currently number
124 on the Billboard chart, and
has been rising since its entry in
the middle of September.

Notes: The MUSE concert
film which was made at the
September shows in Madison
Square Garden will be released
in late spring, 1980. Although a
writer has yet to be procured
for the film, swift production
has been promised through a
$400,000 budget and a volunteer
staff of no-nuke radicals. The
major problem with the whole
deal-record and film, is the
balance between music and ac-
tivism, as some sides want
more political content as oppos-
ed to a musical good time which
might hold up the release of the

Ibum!

Film Society To Present Comedy

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film Society will pre-
sent its second feature of the season, Louis
Malle’s French comedyThe Murmur of the
Heart, this Friday and Saturday. The movie will
be screened at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A’’ (note
change of room) of the Law School, free of
charge, and everyone is cordially invited to at-
tend.

Louis Malle, who is also the director of the
recently distributed Pretty Baby, has a history
of making movies on taboo subjects. Through his
de-sensationalized treatment potentially unsettl-
ing subjects are humanized and made moving.
For instance, his early movie The Lovers (1958),
with Jeanne Moreau, helped break the ground
for a frank presentation of sexuality in serious
film.

Malle’s The Murmur of the Heat (1971) is one
‘of the gems of cinema history. It is what would

appear at first to be an unpromising paradox: a
comedy about incest.

The plot concerns a young adolescent boy
whose “‘heart murmur” forces him to drop out of
school for a year. He spends the year at home in
increasingly greater closeness with his mother,
who is played by the ravishingly beautiful Lea
Massari.

With typically French deftness and drollery.
Malle shows the boy having his first sexual ex-
perience, with his mother, and then getting up
and finding himself a girlfriend of his own age.
This is one of a very few works of art that have
the wit and the courage to imagine a way out of
the oedipal triangle.

The Film Society’s next movie is Werner Her
zog’s treatment of the myth of the wild or feral
child, The Mystery of Kasper Hauser, set out
December 7 and 8. The next meeting of the Socie-
ty will take place November 13 at 7:30 p.m. in
Payne 3. We will be selecting winter films. and
all members are invited to attend

 

 

Film Notes

Soylent Green (MGM, 1973) Charlton Heston stars as a New York
cop in this futuristic drama about the struggles of man after a
. nuclear holocaust. There is no plant life, people live in automobiles
and even worse. Presented by the SAB, Friday, Saturday and Sun-
day, at 7 and 9 p.m. in classroom ‘‘C’’ of Lewis Hall. Admission is
$1.00.

The Murmur of the Heart (French, 1972) A comedy of incest and
adolescence, directed by Louis (Pretty Baby) Malle. A further
discussion appears in this issue of the Ring-tum Phi. Presented by
the Film Society, Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. in classroom ‘‘A”’

The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (British, 1962) An ear-
ly film by Tony Richardson, adapted from Alan Sillitoe’s highly

lacks the staginess so common in Richardson’s early works. To be
shown in Reid 203 on Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m. Admission if free.

Movie Review

Concorde ‘79 Is One
Airport Too Many

by Dash Coufal

 

The Concorde Airport ’79
Directed by David Lowel Rich
Written by Eric Roth

With George Kennedy, Alain
Delon, Susan Blakely and
Robert Wagner

Another jaunt into the world
of the rich, famous and power-
ful that once again comes off as
tacky.

Remember the thirties when
Hollywood set the styles of the
nation? Well, that era is long
past, as this movie so blatantly
shows.

The plot, tenuous at best, goes
something like this: Robert
Wagner is trying to shoot down
the Concorde, en route from
Washington to Paris to the
Moscow Olympics, because a
woman reporter on_ board,
Susan Blakely, has papers that
prove Wagner authorized il-
legal arms sales by his corpora-
tion.

First Wagner tries a cruise
missle, then a private Phanton
jet, then an internal device. Stir
into this numerous sub-plots,
and cameos with sub-sub-plots
such as: a Russian gymnastics
team on board, a human heart
on ice, the crews’ private lives,
and the fact that almost

Now you know what’s going to
happen: everything turns out
OK. Every sub-plot and sub-
sub-plot turns out for the best.
This is a complete lack of hones-
ty on the part of the movie.

With so much going on at
least some of it could go sour,
just to give the movie honesty,
not to mention that there is no
real danger to the plane. Let’s
make an Airport movie where
the plane goes down just to give
the series some honesty.

The sets, lines, and women
are equally cheap. Most of the
scenes not filmed on the plane
or on location look like they
were filmed in a Howard
Johnson's. The hotel rooms look
cheap with polyester carpeting
on the floor.

The lines are too dumb to
even remember; not once does

anyone, not even Robert
Wagner, have a snappy line.
And the women all look to be
rich chippies. Why is it that only
Harold Robins’ movies have
that touch of class?

The movie isn’t even thrilling.
Since we know that the plane
couldn't go down, it ceases to be
at all exciting. For thrills go see
Dawn Of The Dead.

A temptingly tasteful
comedy for adults

If you buy the old paper-chase
idea that America’s law
students are all work and no
play, stick around this
weekend.

A pair of them at Washington
and Lee University will become
“‘players”’ in the literal sense on
Saturday (Nov. 3) when they of-
fer a review of the American
popular song, from ragtime to
swing. Their extravaganza,
‘Jackie and Phil: Words and
Music,”’ will be presented free
in duPont Auditorium on the
W&L front campus at 8 p.m.

Jackie Boyden, soprano, and
Phil Calderone, pianist, will
begin their tour through the na-
tion’s musical memories with
the Nashville rags of the 1890s,
‘‘a school characterized by a
mix of black folk sources and
white Tennessee hill music,”
according to Calderone.

From there, the program will
cover many of the high spots of
American pop and show music
— from the Gershwins (‘‘Em-
braceable You”’ and ‘‘Our Love
is Here To Stay’) through Cole
Porter (‘I’ve Got You Under
My Skin” and ‘‘I Get a Kick Out
of You’’) to Rogers and Hart
(‘‘Where or When’’ and ‘‘Bewit-
ched’’) and the swing-era sound
of Duke Ellington and Billy
Strayhorn (‘‘I Got It Bad and
That Ain’t Good’ and ‘Take
The A Train’’).

Both weekend showmen are
third-year law students at W&L.
Boyden, an honors graduate of
the University of Michigan, is
from Grand Rapids. Calderone,
from Merrick, N.Y., is a magna
cum laude graduate of the
University of Virginia.

Their production is sponsored
by Phi Delta Phi legal fraterni-
ty. The public is invited to at-
tend.

everybody knows each other

side Salt Lake City in ’75...’’)

From the Pressbox

Babe Was Wrong?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Willie Mays said he was bewildered. Frank Sinatra
called it an outrage. And W&L’s Chuck Strome billed
it as his ‘‘Boo of the Week.”’

In a seemingly unreasonable and unfair decision,
Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered Hall of
Famer Willie Mays to sever all connections with
baseball. Kuhn’s verdict was made in light of Mays’
decision to sign a multi-million-dollar contract with
the Park Place Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J.

Because Mays will be connected with a gambling
firm—although Mays will in no way be directly af-
filiated with the gambling operations—Kuhn told
Mays to relinquish his working ‘‘sweet-heart’’ agree-
ment with the New York Mets.

Mays said he made his decision to work for the hotel
in consideration of what would be better for his fami-
ly. His contract with the Mets called for $50,000 a year

for 10 years after his retirement. The Park Place con-
tract is for $100,000 a year for three years with a pro-
vision for an additional seven years at an escalating
salary that could go as high as $150,000.

Why has the commissioner forced the greatest
centerfielder to ever put on a pair of spiked shoes to
disassociate himself from the game he loved and
served so dearly? I guess because the commissioner
feels that Mays’ duties with the hotel would conflict
with his duties with the Mets. He felt Willie’s connec-
tion with the hotel would give baseball a bad name.

But do not several baseball owners also own and
race thoroughbred horses? Did not Dick Allen own
and train race horses while still a part-time player?
Isn’t this considered to be an affiliation with gambl-
ing? Is the casino less respectable than Belmont Park
or Churchill Downs?

What is really distressing is that Atlantic City is not
off limits to other baseball people, only Willie Mays.
Other players have access to both casinos and race
tracks across the country. And Willie Mays doesn’t
even gamble!

Mays’ duties for the hotel will range from shaking
hands with celebrities to visiting children in hospitals
and serving as master of ceremonies at the annual
hotel picnic.

Also, Mays is no longer an active player and is not
that close to the game anymore. It is doubtful that a
part-time coach and a good-will ambassador for the
Mets could throw a ballgame. The Mets don’t need
any help throwing games—they throw away 100
games a year without Willie’s help.

Mays made a smart decision in signing with the
hotel. It is an all-around sound offer which should
benefit Willie, his family and the hotel.

Kuhn made a not-so-smart decision. I cannot
understand how he could think that Willie Mays could
embarrass baseball. Many fans across the country
are outraged with the commissioner’s decision.

He has told Willie Mays—the same Willie Mays who
thrilled baseball fans with his amazing fielding and
his potent hitting for 22 years—that he must
disassociate himself from the game. Mays has pro-
bably done more for baseball than all of the commis-
sioners put together.

Willie Mays devoted his life to baseball—as a
player, as a coach and as a good-will ambassador. Is
this how baseball repays him? Is his goodwill no
longer good enough?

Babe Ruth once said, “Baseball is a great game.
Give it all you have all the time. Be good to
baseball and baseball will be good to you.’’ Willie
Mays was good to baseball—he gave it all he had.

Maybe the Babe was wrong.

 

 

Generals Dunked 7-4;
Richmond State Champs

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
travelled to Richmond last
weekend to compete in the
Virginia State Championships.
Despite winning four games
against only one loss, they
finished the tournament second
to the University of Richmond.

The Generals defeated
Hampden-Sydney, Richmond’s
JV, and Virginia twice.
However, they lost to arch-rival
Richmond, who ended up the
tournament winners.

The weekend’s games
brought W&L’s record to 17-3
going into the Southern League
Championships which will be
played this weekend at W&L.
The General water polo team
holds the number-one seed for
the tournament.

W&L Coach Page Remillard
had ‘‘mixed feelings’’ about last
weekend’s tournament. He feels
that some of the other teams in
the state, and Virginia water
polo in general, would benefit
more from what he calls a
“developmental tournament.’’
He feels that the obvious
dominance over the rest of the
teams in the state by W&L and
Richmond necessitates a tour-
nament in which these teams
are not allowed to play. Instead
he feels that the two schools
should send only their JV teams
to this tournament in the in-
terest of “developing water polo
in the state of Virginia.”

Against Richmond last
weekend, the Generals played
well despite coming out on the
short end of a 7-4 score. In the
words of Coach Remillard, ‘‘We
got all the bad _ breaks.”
However, he was pleased with
his team’s overall performance
for the game and the tourna-
ment.

Commenting on the team’s of-
fense, Remillard praised the
play of Trip Johnson, who show-
ed great improvement as an of-
fensive threat and who was one

of the team’s most consistent
scorers. Remillard also men-
tioned the defensive play of
senior standout Mike Foley,
who held Richmond’s key offen-
sive player to one point.

The Generals, although they
would have like to win last
weekend, put the main im-
portance for the season on the
upcoming league tournament.
Teams competing in the tourna-

ment are: Georgia Southern,
Duke, Richmond, and W&L.

~ nament.

Remillard expects to get by
GSU in their match Saturday at
10 a.m. after which they should
take on the winner of the Duke-
Richmond game at 4 p.m.

As usual, beating Richmond
is the key to victory in the tour-
Remillard believes
that the Generals can and will
do it. He encourages fan sup-
port and promises quality water
polo, saying, ‘“We have momen-
tum, confidence, and the talent
to do the job.”’

Pushing For Bermuda

by Bill Hogan

While most of the W&L com-
munity will be going home dur-
ing the upcoming February
break, the 1980 varsity lacrosse
team will be flying south to Ber-
muda for a nine-day ‘‘vaca-
tion.”

According to. senior
defenseman Steve Johnson, the
trip will not be all fun and
games as head coach Jack Em-
mer has scheduled two-a-day
practice sessions for each day.
The agenda calls for the team to
leave for Bermuda on February
16th from Roanoke Airport.
They will return home on
February 24 in time to resume
classes.

While in Bermuda, the
Generals will stay in a
dormitory-type facility set up
by the Ministry of Sports in an
attempt to keep housing costs
down. The team will bring
enough food with them to last

 

the entire vacation. This will
also help keep costs at a
minimum.

“I think the trip will definitely
help the team get ready for the
season,’’ said senior co-captain
Bob Clements. ‘‘The warm
weather will allow us to prac-
tice outdoors whereas here we
spend a lot of time indoors
because of snow.’’ The players
generally agree that the trip
certainly compensates for prac-

ticing during the vacation.

Coach Emmer estimates the
trip to cost around $7,500, which
the lacrosse team is raising at
present. The Generals have
been selling lacrosse hats and
are planning a marathon ‘‘bed-
push” from Hollins College to
Zollman’s Pavillion on Sunday,
where the team will celebrate
their feat with a party. The
“bed-push” is scheduled to
begin at 5 a.m. Sunday.

Bridgewater Stomps W&L;
Generals Last In ODAC

by Dale Park
The Bridgewater Eagles foot-
ball team ended a nine-game
dry spell against the Generals,
handing W&L a 19-3 loss on
Wilson Field and dropping the
Generals’ ODAC record to 1-4.

The Eagles had not beaten the
Generals in the first nine
meetings between these two
teams. But the 1,733 W&L fans
watched a W&L team that was
plagued by untimely errors and
missed opportunities.

“Last week we lost our con-
centration at key times,” said
head coach Gary Fallon. “We
let them have a few big plays on
offense and gave them the ball
on defense.”

The Generals’ problem was
two-fold. First, they coughed up
the ball twice and both fumbles
were costly.

W&L fumbled the ball on its
own 19-yard line during its very
first offensive series. Eagles’
kicker Dan Callaghan quickly
put Bridgewater on top 3-0 with
a 30-yard field goal. Callaghan
later added a 25-yarder in the
opening seconds of the second
period, giving the Eagles a 6-0
lead.

A second W&L fumble was to
prove even more costly. Early
in the fourth quarter, the
Generals had driven to the
Bridgewater one yard line only
to furnble the ball out of the
Eagles’ endzone. The ensuing
touchback moved the ball out to
the Bridgewater 20-yard line,
giving the Eagles the ball and
killing a golden scoring op-
portunity for the Generals.

The second of W&L’s pro-
blems was interceptions. Three
W&L passes were picked off due
largely to the tenacious Eagles’
front four which put pressure on
W&L’s quarterbacks all after-
noon.

Bridgewater defensive back
Kevin Wholey had a field day,
picking off two W&L passes and
running the first back 56 yards
for a touchdown. Callaghan’s
conversion gave the Eagles a
13-0 lead with 12:26 left in the
first half.

 

Harriers

Beat H-S

The Washington & Lee cross
country team managed a close
22-33 win over rival Hampden-
Sydney in a dual meet last
Saturday at W&L.

The Generals were led by
their captain, senior Rich Bird,
who paced the team with a
second-place finish.

The Generals will face
Hampden-Sydney again this
weekend when they travel to
Farmville to run in the fourth
annual ODAC Championship.
Saturday’s meet, which starts
at 11 a.m., will feature seven
schools on a five-mile course.

 

 

 

 

Tight end Syd Farrar hauls in a pass against Bridgewater. W&L is
at home Saturday against Maryville.

Four General quarterbacks
saw action during the after-
noon; sophomores Jim Wenke
and Rich Hachenburg, and
freshmen Chris Cavalline and
Jeff Snyder. In all, they combin-
ed for 131 yards through the air.

Equally impressive was
W&L’s 207 yards rushing
spearheaded by senior tailback
Stewart Atkinson. Atkinson
gained 108 yards on 20 carries,
upping his season’s rushing
total to 760 yards.

Freshman kicker Bill Devine
remained flawless for the
Generals, giving W&L its only
points of the afternoon by con-
verting on a 30-yard field goal
attempt as the first half ran out.
His boot cut the Eagles’ lead to
13-3.

Although the Generals
outgained the Eagles in total of-
fense, 273 to 258 yards, W&L
was beaten by the big play.

The Eagles drove to midfield
in the opening minutes of the se-
cond half, where Bridgewater
quarterback Duanne Harrison
threw a a pass to his wide
receiver Joe Kunlo.

The General defensive back
made a good play on the ball,
batting it with his hands. Yet
the ball struck Kunlo sharply in
the chest, and bounced into his
hands. After juggling the ball
for several yards, the Eagle
receiver somehow maintained
possession and raced the re-
mainder of the field to complete
a 50-yard touchdown pass play.
Callaghan’s conversion was
blocked, and the score remain-
ed 19-3 for the rest of the game.

“We can’t have these slip-ups
if we’re to give Maryville a
challenge next week,’ said
Fallon. ‘‘Maryville runs from a
wing and I-slot on offense and
has two fine running backs in
Ken Adair and Alvin Nance.
They are impressive on film
and will be as tough as last
year.”

One of the reasons the Scots
will remain tough is that 15 of
last years 22 starters are retur-
ning. Maryville was a big win-
ner last week, beating
Southwestern Tennessee 294.

As I See It ..
What Happened?

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

What happened last Saturday on Wilson Field is
almost beyond belief. Washington & Lee lost to
Bridgewater. That’s right, Bridgewater — the same
team the Generals had not lost to in nine previous
meetings on the gridiron. But all good things must
come to an end, which happened last Saturday.

Before I analyze last Saturday’s results, let me tell
you a little bit about Bridgewater. The Eagles were a
2-4 team that had lost 18-6 to Emory & Henry (a team
W&L lost to by six) and 27-10 to Hampden-Sydney (a
team W&L beat 20-0). In other words, Bridgewater is
one of those teams you want to schedule for
Homecoming weekend. Bridgewater is also one of
those teams you look at before the season and count
on as being a guaranteed win. At least, this is what
most of us in the pressbox were thinking before the
game started. Two hours later, we didn’t know what
to think.

Last Saturday, the Generals ran more offensive
plays, gained more first downs, outrushed and out-
passed the opposition and even held the ball longer.
But when the final gun went off, the Generals had lost,
19-3.

The only apparent reason for this loss was that
W&L was a flat football team on Saturday. Perhaps it
was an underestimation of the opposition or perhaps
it was a continuing state of depression from the
Sewanee game, but the Generals simply did not have
their act together against Bridgewater.

Offensively, W&L played a statistically good game.
But sometimes statistics don’t tell the real story.
Along with an advantage in plays and yardage, the
Generals also had three big turnovers — three ugly
plays which changed the game’s outcome.

The first turnover came with the ball on W&L’s 38.
The ensuing fumble gave Bridgewater the ball on the
18. Four plays later, it was 3-0.

The second mistake occurred with the score 6-0 and
the ball on W&L’s 44. A poorly thrown sideline pass
was converted into a 47-yard interception return and
a 13-0 Bridgewater lead.

The final mishap was the one which killed any
hopes of a W&L comeback. With the ball on the
Bridgewater five, the Generals ran the ball down to
the one and fumbled it out of the endzone. This hap-
pened early in the fourth quarter and kept W&L a
comfortable 16 points away.

Without these three turnovers, a 19-3 disadvantage
could, instead, have been a 10-10 deadlock.

Besides the turnovers, one other statistic tells why
the Generals lost. W&L used four quarterbacks while
Bridgewater stayed with one signal-caller. Last
Saturday, it was clear that W&L could not find one
player to effectively run the offense.

Candidate number one, Jim Wenke, completed four
of ten passes for 75 yards and two interceptions. Can-
didate number two, Chris Cavalline, completed three
of seven for 33 yards and one interception. Candidate
number three, Rich Hachenburg, two for two, gaining
28 yards. Candidate number four, Jeff Snyder, com-
pleted three of four passes for twenty-five yards.

Overall, the four quarterbacks completed 12 of 21
passes for 131 yards and a lot of confusion. What the
offense needed was one quarterback, not four, who
could do it all.

Bridgewater had one quarterback who could do it
all — which is why they came out on top. Duane Har-
rison threw the long ball (a 50 yard TD pass), he
threw short passes and was quick enough to escape
big losses. He also was a lot luckier than the W&L
signal-callers.

Jim Wenke is a good veer quarterback who can also
throw an occasional short pass. Chris Cavalline is a
good wishbone quarterback who is more of a runner

by Kip Gordon

About this time last year,
W&L freshman Bill Devine was
a high school place-kicker who
could be generously described
as average. Yet one year later,
he is a college level place-
kicker whose performance has
been flawless. The adjustment
which Devine made during that
year made him a blue-chip foot-
ball player and brought the
Generals their first barefoot
kicker.

Devine explained: ‘‘I figured
if Tony Franklin could set the
NCAA record for the longest
field goal kicking barefoot, then
it was worthatry.”’

He did most of his work on the
new style over the summer,
receiving the coaching of VMI
All-American _ place-kicker
Craig Jones. Jones was able to
instruct him on the technical
aspects of placekicking as
Devine, in fact, knows little
about the mechanics of booting
a football.

 

The results of his work speak
for themselves. Devine has yet
to miss a field goal or extra
point in six attempts for each.
His longest field goal was 40
yards (four yards short of the

school record) and he_ has
booted a 55-yarder in practice.

Devine attributes some of his.
success to the fact that, unlike
his high school program, he can
now devote all the time he needs
to his place-kicking. This prac-
tice time usually involves about
forty-five minutes each day,

In ODAC

conference. This was good
enough for a second place finish
while Lynchburg won the con-

ference title, which the
Generals captured in 1978.
Against Lynchburg, the

Generals were plagued by the
same problems which have
haunted them all season long.
Their offense simply could not
get untracked. The Generals
could only muster six shots on
goal while Lynchburg wore
down W&L,s defense with 20
shots.

The Generals went through
three goalkeepers in giving up
the three goals. Player of the
game for the Generals was
defender Homer Bliss.

The varsity’s next opponent
will be VMI in a match to be
played this Sunday on Wilson
Field. Game time for the
General's final home game is 2
p.m.

alone on Wilson field, before
joining the rest of the team for
regular practice.

Most of the improvement, of
course, seems to be due to the
switch to the barefoot style,
which Devine claims has
drastically improved his ac-
curacy.

There are, however, a
number of problems that can
accompany this unique kicking
style. Striking the wrong part of
the ball or getting stepped on
can each produce disabling ef-

fects.

Outdoors:

Kicking Up A Storm

' But one of Devine’s main con-
cerns is the weather. ‘‘So far
I’ve been lucky...I’m not really
sure what it would belike to kick
in cold weather.”

He is certain, however, that
without the switch to barefoot
kicking he would not be playing
for the football Generals. Of
course, there was the case of an
NFL barefoot kicker who tried:
to remedy the effects of cold
weather during a game played
in Minnesota, numbing his foot
with ice water. Said Devine, ‘‘I
don’t think I’d like that.”

Maryland Geese

by Ross Newell
Guest Columnist

Arriving in Chestertown,
Maryland before daybreak, the
magical sound of goose music
combined with the lapping of
waves on the shoreline to con-
vince me that I had indeed
found a goose hunter’s heaven.

Fifteen minutes passed
before I could pull myself away
from the shore of the Chester
River where the symphony of
thousands of honking geese fill-
ed me with a sense of exhilara-
tion which I usually lack at 5
a.m. Climbing out of bed an
hour later, I was again greeted
by the honking of geese, but now
the symphony was occasionally
accented by distant shotgun
blasts; opening day of the
Maryland goose hunting season
was in full swing.

The goose blind, on the shore
of a cove bordered on two sides
by cut corn fields, had a stand of
about 60 goose decoys bobbing
in front of it. Still 200 yards from
the blind, I watched, trying to
take in the scene before me. It
was a beautiful fall day and the
blue sky, whitened by whisps of
clouds, was filled by huge flocks
of geese that resembled swarm-
ing gnats more than waterfowl.

Once in the blind, I barely had
time to load my gun before my
buddy uttered several pro-

fanities that caused me to look

up. Wings cupped, necks stret-
ched forward, feet extended,
four huge but graceful Cana-
dian geese were gliding over the
decoys.

You might have heard about
deer hunters getting buck
fever; I’d like to tell you about
goose fever. Looking one of
those big geese square in the
eye, knees shaking, palms
sweating, eyes watering, breath
short and irregular, I stood and

_ missed not one, but three of the

easiest shots I’ve ever had.

However, there was no time
for excuses. Of the thousands of
geese in the air, two had made
up their minds to retest my
nerves. Low on the river in front
of the blind, they came in an un-
wavering path towards the
decoys. At the last minute the
pair of geese gained altitude
and sailed past the decoys and
over the blind.

I knew before I pulled the
trigger that my first shot would
miss. Pressing cheek to the
stock of the gun I looked down
the barrel at the goose grabbing
with powerful wings for
altitude. Swinging in front of
him I pulled the trigger a se-
cond time and my first goose of
the day dropped with a splash in
front of the blind.

For the next two hours the sky
remained filled with geese and
action was nonstop. Accepting
the fact that we were not in a
dream that might at any minute
be ended, my friend and I
assumed the arrogant attitude
of seasoned Maryland goose
hunters. We no longer even
picked up our guns unless the
goose in question presented a
perfect shot at less than 30
yards.

-Perhaps the spirit and ex-
cellence of Maryland goose hun-
ting, and this hunt in particular,
was captured in a single mo-
ment late in the hunt. A lone
goose, typically demonstrating
his species’ aerobatic
gracefulness, sailed into the
decoys. As I stood to shoot, my
buddy said, “Why don’t we let
that one go; he’s mighty
small.”’ Putting my gun down
as the goose landed in the
decoys, I turned to my friend
with a smile and said, ‘“‘Nobody
is ever going to believe us.”’

 

Four QBs Too Many?

(continued from page 7)
than a passer. Rich Hachenburg is a good runner with
better passing skills than Wenke or Cavalline. Jeff
Snyder is potentially the best passer of the four but
needs more playing experience. All four men also
have at least two years of eligibility left after this

season.

What Gary Fallon and his coaching staff must now
do is choose one these quarterbacks and develop a
team around him. Last Saturday, the Generals could
not stick to one offensive style and it hurt them.

Playing one quarterback would eventually produce
a team leader; a take-charge player who could be the
difference between winning and losing. Last Satur-

day, this was the case.

 
 

Chicago Symphony On WLUR

Sir Michael Tippett’s Sym-
phony No. 4 — commissioned
especially for the Chicago Sym-
phony on the occasion of the or-
chestra’s 80th anniversary in
1977 — will highlight this week’s
symphony broadcast on WLUR,
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s radio station beginning at 6
p.m. this Friday. (Nov. 2) Sir
Georg Solti, music director of
the Symphony, will conduct the
performance.

Also featured that night will
be a presentation of Tchaikoy-
sky’s Symphony No. 6 in B
Minor, the ‘‘Pathetique.’’ One
of the most expressive of 19th
century Romantic composers,
Tchaikovsky referred to this
work as his ‘monument to
woe.”’ Although he was often
harshly critical of his own work,
of this symphony he wrote to a
friend, “‘I love it as I have never
loved any of my other musical
creations.”’

As an encore, Rossini’s Over-
ture to ‘‘The Barber of Seville”’

will be broadcast as the con-

by Todd Smith

Despite flying words and
tempers, the Washington and
Lee Debate Union reconvened
for the year without resolving
the question of whether or not to
recognize the Palestine Libera-
tion Organization.

The only point of agreement
at last Thursday night’s debate
was on the next debate’s topic:
‘‘Resolved, Nuclear Power
should be banned.”’

Arguing for the proposition
that the United States should
recognize the P.L.O., James
Rodriguez briefly traced the
history of the recognition con-
troversy. He cited the P.L.O.’s
recognition by the United Na-
tions and by over a hundred
foreign nations, a number even
greater than those recognizing
Israel.

Todd Smith led the opposi-
tion, questioning whether
P.L.O. leader Yassir Arafat
could retain power if he made
any conciliations to Israel.
Smith claimed recognition of

IPLO Tackled In Debate

the P.L.O. would cause a
resurgence of turmoil in the
Middle East and undo all

previous diplomatic progress.

Then teammate Danny Eins-
tein took the floor to remind the
affirmative side of Henry Kiss-
inger’s promise as Secretary of
State in 1975 that the United
States would not recognize the
’.L0. wet: we F.4.0.
recognized Israel by accepting
U.N. Resolution 242.

Scott Van Dyke rose to defend
the P.L.O. ‘Israel is an
economic drain on the U.S.,”
claimed Van Dyke, and not
worth the trouble it has caused
us among oil-producing nations.
The argument broke into a
heated discussion of Israel’s ex-
panionist policies and the ter-
rorism associated with the
P.L.O.

The debate was chaired by
Sam Perkins, who was forced to
call an end to the proceedings
as the argument strayed fur-
ther from the topic.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

You Can Wear Jeans
To Our Party

Hollins has distributed flyers at Washington and
Lee advertising their Sunday party—and it looks like
the same old song. Janice is playing, and those in-
terested are advised by the posters that one must pay
$4 a person, 40‘ a beer, no BYOB, and no jeans.

NO JEANS! Can you believe it? One can stomach
only so much of a certain attitude. Granted, it’s their
party (we wonder how many Hollins students would
prefer to wear jeans, if they had a say in the deci-
sion). Granted, the party is part of their big weekend.
But when it comes time to stand in line for beer and
tickets, many of us will be footing the bill—just as we
do when we have free (for girls) live bands and free
(for girls) drinks at our fraternity parties and class-
pass parties.

For those who would like a change of pace, the SAB
is sponsoring at the same time what looks like a really
great party at the ‘‘nasty ‘o’ Pavillion.”’ For $2 a per-
son gets two bands, all the beer he wants, and no dress
code. Stillwater and the Boot Hill Express will play
some fine country rock tunes perfect for a Fall Sun-
day afternoon. This is a rare chance for most of us to
take our dates to see something different.

W&L students are a complaining breed, and nothing
receives more complaints than the music here. The
SAB is offering an alternative; those of you who want
more of these types of bands and parties must support
this one. But if you get roped into a situation of double
jeopardy, this is the ‘“‘pay twice syndrome,”’ and come
out feeling like you’ve seen it all before, all we can say
is, ‘“Told you, I told you so...”’

Pass-Fail, Again

We don’t want to repeat ourselves, but we just
thought before the next faculty meeting that we’d put
in another plug for making the pass-fail option
private. We hope the faculty will give serious thought
to relinquishing its control over pass-fail so that just
the student and the registrar have to worry about it.

We’ve heard the arguments extolling the dangers of
students not taking a pass-fail course as seriously as
his other subjects. Surely the faculty realized when
pass-fail was instituted at W&L, limited as it is, that it
was helping to promote experiments in a liberal arts
education by reducing the risks. We think the incen-
tive for choosing a course or examining a different
academic discipline would be further incieased if it
) a matter only between the registrar and the stu-

ent.

More EC Minutia

The student body Executive Committee debate
Monday night over two changes in last week’s EC
minutes resulted in a 6-5 victory for those backing the
corrections. Freshman EC Rep. Edmund Schenecker
was the Edmund Schenecker gave the deciding vote,
which deleted a ‘‘p”’ floating in the left hand margin,
and reworded ‘‘There being no further business to
discuss, the meeting adjourned at 7:35 p.m.” to “Be-
ing that there was no further business to discuss, the
Committee adjourned the meeting at 7:35 p.m.”

Should we consider the EC’s protracted discus-
sion as merely a concentration on the minutia?

 

Letter

To The Editor
More
Grafitti

Dear Editor,

During the past week there
have been at least three in-
stances of grafitti on the cam-
pus academic buildings. It was,
to say the least, sickening.
While I have great respect for
this institution and its tradi-
tions, I have to wonder about
the type of students we now
have here (Yes, I believe
students were responsible for
the acts).

It was no accident, I am sure,
that the grafitti appeared the
same weekend that the Board of
Trustees were meeting. What I
fail to understand are 1) what
the writer was trying to ac-
complish and 2) why some peo-
ple have a need to deface
private property. There is ab-
solutely no justification for such
an act, and this weekend’s ex-
ample could not have been in
poorer taste.

, . Last weekend’s incident br-
oe ings me to another point, not
totally unrelated. There are
many clubs and organizations
on campus that put up posters
advertising meetings and other

Both Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Kappa Alpha fraternities held

ing. By all accounts, both fraternity parties were a big Success and

events, and almost each group,
at one time, has had their
posters torn down or written on,
many times within hours of be-
ing posted. Certainly this could
be a technical honor violation.

Persiflage

A Wednesday Night

It’s 6:30 in the evening on a
late October day and already
it’s cold and dark outside. Stark
classical music is on WLUR and
its sound echoes through the
shack that my _ landlord
somehow deems worth more
than $60 a month.

Cars are prowling ominously
outside.

I put down my copy of The
Painted Bird and venture
over to the refrigerator. The
harsh light inside reveals only a
lump of cheese and a rotted
piece of fruit.

I pass by the pictures of
Dostoevski and Solzhenitsyn
hanging in the hallway and
enter my room. The light is out
but I can hear mice scurrying
about as they sense my
presence.

I reach for the bag of goods I
purchased earlier in the day. I
am prepared for the inevitable.

As I head back down the
hallway I hear footsteps on the
gravel outside. I stop in my
tracks. It’s too late to reach the
light in the kitchen to turn it out.
They know I’m here.

I trudge toward the door
reconciling myself to my fate. I
had hoped that somehow I
might be spared, that I
somehow might not be noticed.
No more time for pity — the
pounding on the door is getting

In the current essays marking the 50th an-
niversary of the Crash of ’29, the question, stated
or not, inevitably pops out at the reader: ‘‘Can it
happen now?” The mood of the day might en-
courage such a somber connection of past and
present, even though the raw economic facts
bear little resemblance.

The nation is seen these days to be heading into
a recession, inspiring concern about how deep it
will be. Federal Reserve policy seeks to fight in-
flation by significantly tightening money and
credit, at the expense of a more pronounced
downturn.

 

Both this editorial and Mr. Olipant’s cartoon are
reprinted from The Washington Star, where they
originally appeared on Monday, October 29.

 

Wall Street in the last month has had days of
extreme nervousness, if not panic, with prices
dropping in huge volumes of sales. Strange
clouds are on the horizon: a bruising presidential
contest, an energy crisis that could lead
anywhere, dangers of international confronta-
tion. Economists, formerly confident in their
recommendations, offer humble and divided
counsel.

So there is some coincidence of atmosphere
between now and then, when the boom of the ’20s
started coming apart. It can be dismissed at
that. No one has to treat seriously the resuscita-
tion (in The Wall Street Journal) of a Russian
economist’s theory about economic events hap-
pening in 50-year cycles. The differences bet-
ween 1929 and 1979 are more telling than any ap-
parent similarities.

Take the stock market, whose collapse herald-
ed and in some histories was seen as a cause of
the Great Depression. It’s a different place now,
in part because of government efforts to end
speculative abuses that helped bring on the
Crash. People can no longer buy stock with only
10 percent down. The Securities and Exchange
Commission polices against fraud. Institutional
investors—professionals charged with the care
of funds for the millions—have come to dominate
the buying and selling of securities.

Today’s economic dangers
are plentiful. We hardly

need to revive any from
half a century ago.

 

American society is much changed, and the
economy has many built-in safeguards it didn’t
have to soften violent fluctuations. Economic
policy-makers, whatever their limitations, did
learn from the bitter experiences of 40 or 50
years ago. At least they understand what actions
will tend to make hard times harder.

Does that mean Black Tuesday (October 29,
1929) and its aftermath cannot be repeated? It
takes a brave optimist to make that claim. John
Kenneth Galbraith sees the possibility of another
“cycle of speculation and collapse,”’ despite laws

against ‘‘the more egregious behavior’ of the
1920s. ‘‘Nothing has been done about the seminal
lunacy that possesses people who see a chance of
becoming rich,” Dr. Galbraith concluded in a re-
cent commemorative piece in THE NEW
REPUBLIC.

Provided we get safely past this anniversary
(one analyst actually blames articles like this for
Wall Street’s recent jitters), other economic
dangers are more deserving of the attention of
professional worriers. Severe inflation is behind
the Federal Reserve's tightening of money and
credit. International oil supplies are subject to
disruption. OPEC’s prices could damage the
world monetary system, not to speak of many
national economies. Some experts fear a col-
lapse of the Eurocurrency market, posing dif-
ficulties for international trade. Today’s
economic dangers are plentiful. We hardly need
to revive any from half a century ago.

 

To avoid a preachy sermonette, (if you
don’t know the term “‘social responsibility’’
by now you deserve the world’s pity) let me
tell you about other schools. Oh, let me see,
how about... Princeton. (Please let one of
those nasty boys from Thursday read this! )

The eating clubs at Princeton such as Ivy
and Cottage are similar to fraternities.
Similar in that some boys live there and other
boys are members. That’s as far as it goes.
The houses are something your mothers
would love. They are well taken care of. The
boys are too, in their jackets and ties.

When you enter the club, oriental rugs,
gilted mirrors, polished staircases and silver
fountains bubbling of various beverages greet
you. If you haven’t seen a real powder room in
a while check out the third floor of Ivy. (The
entire third floor is devoted to the needs and

the Rock.”

 

comforts of female guests). A clean powder
room, not bathroom, with matching chairs
and couches, all of you. That may be a bit
much but I wouldn:t mind going in one now
and then.

What really floors you is the presence of ash
trays. Being overwhelmed by the sight of an
ashtray in a fraternity is a sign of previous
primitive living. Just knowing that we stomp
cigarettes on the floor of someone’s house is
so disgusting. I feel sorry for the guys who
have to wake up to all of that sloshed beer,
sticky floors, and wet cigarette butts.

So Princeton provides ash trays, powder
rooms and the treatment distinct to that of a
lady. I’m not sure we are ready for that. If we
want to be treated like ladies, we had better
start acting like them. Getting drunk is fine.
Most of us do it. But, I think psychologists
have something to say about the future of
those to whom vandalism accompanies in-
ebriation.

Monthly Reports At EC Meeting

Manager Kevin McGowan. ‘‘We
did budget only $1,000 for
subscription fees,” he added,
“but we might end up with
$2,000." The amount currently
stands at $1,887.

Abraham said that he had
talked with Bill Washburn, Ex-
ecutive Secretary of the Alumni
Association, and came to a
mutual agreement that
Washburn will contribute
another $200 to the Ring-tum
Phi, bringing his total to $450 for
issues sent to alumni. McGowan
thanked Abraham for his ef-
forts.

The Ariel’s monthly report
noted that all work to date has
been preparatory. The Ariel is
narrowing the choices for works
to be printed in the magazine.

Ariel Editor Chris Faye
pointed out that deadlines for
submitted materials are Oct. 31
and that as of yet the only ex-
pense incurred was one dollar.

Discussion on
honor trial was brought up by

- Abraham, who said several

students had talked to him
about the lack of publicity. ‘I
think it’s not necessarily our
fault,’ Abraham said, ‘‘but in

IFC Hazing Proposals

(continued from page 1)
Two Proposals
Following Farrar’s com-
ments about hazing, Delta Tau
Delta president Andy DeMuth
had two suggestions.

The first involved providing
freshmen with a list comparing
aspects — such as cost of room,
board, social dues — of dif-
ferent fraternities.

The second suggestions in-
volved setting up a cooperative
that could save fraternities
money on _ food through
wholesale purchasing.

Action on both suggestion is

planned for the next IFC
meeting, Tuesday, Nov. 13.

the future we should increase
notification by posting signs on
all academic buildings.’’
Abraham added he ‘“‘would like
to see it be a_whitebook
change.”’

Third Year Law Rep. John
Fraser said the Security Com-
mittee had met and decided to
draft a letter to various
students and townspeople ques-
tioning the security problem at
Washington and Lee. Written
comments, said Fraser, should
be submitted to the EC room.

The Committee will hold two
meetings dealing with campus
security on Monday at 4 p.m. in
the EC room and Tuesday at 4
p.m. in Classroom D of Lewis
Hall.

The EC approved a $33.70 bill
for flowers sent to Hiland
Moore’s funeral last Friday.

 

 

Vandalism

(continued from page 1)

Chief Kirby also said that a
stolen tape player has been
recovered from a car in the
parking lot of the Stonewall
Jackson Hospital. Several
juveniles have been charged
with stealing the tape deck.

Kirby said that “‘tape players
are the hottest item of larceny
right now, because they’re
worth more than they used to
be.” Also, they seem to be an

grants, loans, or scholarships,”
Ju said. In this way financial
problems would be overcome.

Visiting artists could come
here to teach or demonstrate
their skills in Oriental art.
Graduate students could come
to continue their research and
teach. Performances like the
one held last Fall on the steps of
Lee Chapel by Normal Univer-
sity of Taiwan students could be
held. DuPont Gallery could be
used to exhibit oriental art.

Presently, the University has
a collection of originals and
replicas of classic oriental art
that it cannot exhibit because of
a lack of space. “‘There is an
over-emphasis on books and
magazines for the program,”
Jusaid.

The best way to improve the
program would be to make the
teaching more graphic. ‘“‘Not
every place has an Asian art

collection or Asian _ per-
formances,’’ he said.

Of course money for W&L’s
program is needed. Sung-
hsiung Hung, who has helped
W&L students studying in
Taiwan, has proposed a plan
that will raise some money. He
is willing to set up an export
company dealing in fine
porcelain and artworks. The
profit from this program would
be turned over to the Asian
studies program. A catalog of
the wares offered could be
distributed to the extended
W&L family. This might be a
constant supply of money, but it
probably wouldn’t be enough.
Initiatives like this would be a
help, however.

It is programs like Asian
Studies that distinguish a
liberal arts college from the
others. W&L could be a center
of study of what will be an in-
creasingly important field, Ju
said.
