Mull Sells College Inn

by Dick Moss

The College Inn, for ten years
a traditional haunt- of
Washington and Lee students,
was Closed over the summer by
its proprietor, Clyde Mull.

Mull, who closed the Inn
because “it was just too much
work,” has leased the building
at 16 N. Main St. to Michael and
Sue Anne Brooks, who have
opened Brooks Metalware,
which sells primarily pewter
items. The Brooks’ expect most
of their business through the
tourist trade.

The large keg beer concession
which Mull ran out of the Col-
lege Inn has been moved to the
Paramout Inn on Washington
Street. Mull is advising the

Mull said that his decision to

which he purchased late last
February and is refurbishing.

The Interfraternity Council's
Judicial Board placed Phi Kap-

Homecoming, for violating Lex-

Both fraternities had been
convicted in court and fined $28
each,

Under a rule passed last spr-

not decide the case until the
fraternities went to court.

Mull said that he is planning
to equip the second floor
ballroom with a large screen
T.V. and a pool table, and will
rent it out for parties. When he
was asked by a reporter how
much the rental for the com-

replied, ‘whatever the market
will stand.”

EC Explains
Second Closed

Honor Trial

by Randy Smith

The student body Executive
Committee attempted to clarify
its stance on the recent granting
of a second closed honor trial to
a former Washington and Lee
student at Monday night’s EC
meeting.

The situation involved a W&L
senior who was found guilty of
an honor code violation last
May, four weeks before he was
to graduate. The situation came
into the public’s view when the
student filed suit in Lynchburg
Federal District Court contend-
ing that his rights of due pro-
cess had been violated and ask-
ed that he be reinstated as a stu-
dent and given another trial in
order to present additional
evidence.

Normally, all honor trial pro-
ceedings are secret.

Steve Abraham, Student
Body President, reading from a
prepared statement, cited a
provision in the White Book
(which explains the honor
system) providing for the
reopening of an honor case:

‘“‘A hearing may be reopened
upon the production of new evi-
dence directly bearing on the
question of guilt or innocence or
to prevent injustices.”’ (Article
L, p. 8)

Abraham then went on to say
that ‘‘the granting of extensions
to the 24 hour time period an ac-
cused student has to request a

public trial is not unprece-
dented but commonplace.”

He went on to quote again
from the White Book: ‘‘the time
for making such a request (for a
public trial) may be extended in
particular cases at the discre-
tion of the Executive Commit-
tee.”’ (Article J, p. 7)

However, the student involv-
ed, Peter Engel of Oakhurst,
N.J., was granted a private
trial, not a “‘public’’ trial as
Abraham stated, leaving the
situation of granting a second
private honor trial still unclear.

Abraham continued:

“At no time did any ad-
ministrative official of this
university bring on pressure to
bear on any member of the E.C.
to conclude an agreement with
the accused. The agreement
was made by last year’s E.C.
and was found to be binding on
this year’s E.C.

“Finding ourselves in this
position, we sought to clarify
the situation for ourselves, the
accused, and the Honor System
by adding one item to the agree-
ment: a reopening of the case,
to be reheard in its entirety, ac-
cording to procedure of the
White Book.”’

Abraham also said _ that
Engel’s federal suit against the
school has not been withdrawn,
as had been reported in the
Ring-tum Phi last week. The
Ring-tum Phi has learned, how-

Big Rock Concerts
Are Dead At W&L

 

by Stuart W. Snyder

There will be no more big rock concerts at
Washington and Lee, according to Michael
Cappeto, Director of the University Center
and Assistant Dean of Students. Cappeto,
faculty advisor for the Student Activities
Board and signer of any major concert con-
tracts, cited a landslide of problems over the
past several years that led to the decision.

Last year the SAB’s Spring Concert was
supposed to be Firefall. According to William
Ridge, one of the SAB Chairmen, the group
was selected from a list of possible acts.

The standard procedure in selecting a
group according to Cappeto is to first select
an agent. Then the agent locates possible acts
based on: music type, an estimated budget
and the proximity to Washington and Lee.

Once the agent has obtained. a list of bet-

ween 2 and 20 acts, then he sends the list to the
university. Next, the SAB selects a group and
notifies the agent.

The agent then contacts the group’s agent
and obtains from the group a ‘‘rider”’ or a list
of items that the university must provide
above and beyond the contract price.

Firefall’s concert would have cost the
university approximately $12,000. Their ten
page rider included such things as ‘‘a local
piano tuner, who is a registered member of
the Piano Technicians Guild,...(to be)
available six hours prior to show time’ and
300 amps of power, according to Cappeto,

enough power to supply all of Lexington with
electricity.

Other features of the rider included: one-
fifth of Jack Daniels Whiskey, three cases of

No More Big Concerts

(continued from page 1)

Heineken Beer, Remy Martin
Cognac, Cuervo Gold Tequila,
specially carpeted rooms for
the Artists crew, furnished
throughout the day with beer,
coffee, juice, soft drinks and
sandwiches and finally a
special diabetic meal that had
to be provided or ‘‘there would
be a breach of contract.”

Next, the university

acknowledges all that it can
provide and the rest of the
negotiations are left to the
agents.

However, according to Ridge,

apparently last Spring there

had been a break down in com-
munications and _ Firefall’s
manager arrived here expec-
ting more than W&L could give.

In the winter of 1977 The
Atlanta Rhythm Section ap-
peared before a crowd of about
1,000 people at a cost of $3,000 to
the university. ‘‘We had hired
them before they became
popular. They were just releas-
ing a new album when we con-
tracted them,’’ Cappeto ex-
plained.

Earlier that year the SAB had
booked Orleans for a Fall Con-
cert. That concert, according to
Cappeto, ‘‘fell apart because of
back stage problems.”

In 1976 The Spinners played
W&L to the tune of $18,000
before a crowd of 1600-1700 peo-
ple. “It was successful...but
there were student complaints
because it was a soul band,”

Cappeto said.

undertaking, said Cappeto.
Virginia Polytechnic Institute,
which has one of the largest
concert schedules, has six or
seven concerts a year. By the
time an underclassman is a
senior, he has a lot of ex-
perience behind him.

“Our university is too small

for a big concert population. All
other schools our size gave up
years ago. We just can’t do
them any more,” Cappeto
stated. He added, “There are
many other benefits that our
university provides that other
schools our size don’t
have...There are sacrifices that
one must make in order to at-

tend a smaller university.
Large concerts are one of
them.”

“There are sacrifices that one must make

in order to attend a smaller university.

Large concerts are one of them.” -Michael Cappeto

 

The biggest complaint of
Firefall’s manager was there
was not enough power, Ridge
said. (200 amps were provided)

According to Ridge, at the
time of the concert it was
agreed that both sides had
“messed-up’’. Since there
would be no concert both par-
ties agreed to let it drop.
However, in July Firefall’s
lawyer sent word to the univer-
sity demanding their ‘‘guaran-
teed’’ pay for the concert or
they would take legal action.

According to Cappeto, he has

“not heard from them since.

“But who can tell about the
legal process,” Cappeto added.

In the past four years, W&L
has booked Harry Chapin, Or-
leans, The Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion and the Spinners. Cappeto
has only termed one of these
concerts as very successful—
The Atlanta Rythm Section.

In 1978 Harry Chapin per-
formed. “‘It was good music,
but only 500 people showed up.
The people who balked at the
Spinners were satisfied but
other people were dissatisfied,”’
Cappeto said. According to Cap-
peto the concert cost $6,000 to
$7,000. Ridge said the people
who went thought it was an ex-
cellent concert.

“As far as a future for ‘big
concerts at W&L, I don’t see
any...The cost is not justifiable.
The money could be put to bet-
ter use,’’ stated Cappeto.

According to Cappeto W&L
just does not have enough ex-
perienced people to handle
large concerts. There is a lot of
work involved,” he added.

James Madison University
has two full-time faculty
members to supervise such an

According to Cappeto, one of
the biggest problems is getting
a group to even come. ‘Then
you have to face what can go
wrong such as: the group
doesn’t like the location or food,
they dislike the drive and
hotels, no convenient airport,
not enough power, stage size is
not big enough and no equip-
ment. There’s just so much that
can go wrong,” Cappeto said.

“Before, the groups would
come here and would try to
work things out,’ he added,
“but recently they have just
come, looked at the place and
said NO!”

The university is planning to
build a pavilion in the future,
but not for the purposes of con-
certs. ‘“The gym is a good place
for it,”’ Cappeto said.

Pi Kappa Alpha, through the
services of an attorney, had its
case postponed.

All penalties imposed by the
IFC are subject to review and
possible revision by the Student
Affairs Committee, a joint
student-faculty body.

While on social probation no
fraternity is allowed to have
women in the house, hold par-
ties or have members con-
gregate in groups consisting of
more than five persons.

Sigma Chi was charged $25 by
Sweet Briar College for
damages done to a carpet dur-
ing a recent impromptu party.

The fraternity was also warn-
ed not to take kegs into the
dorms again.

During the regular IFC
meeting which preceded the
Judicial Board hearing Syd
Farrar, IFC President, discuss-
ed his recent meeting with Lex-
ington Officials and explained
pledging as it will be handled
this year.

“Not much came out of the
meeting with City Manager
Doane and Police Chief Kirby
that we didn’t already know,”
Farrar said.

One change was made in the
issuance of noise permits.

“Originally the police were
not going to issue noise permits
on weeknights, but they have
changed their stance and will
issue them now for big occa-
sions like Fancy Dress,” ex-
plained Farrar.

However, Farrar told repre-
sentatives that summonses will ,
still be issued at the officer’s
discretion.

Farrar also reminded
representatives that freshmen
can attend parties after rush
dates 3 and 4, even if they do not
pledge.

Fraternity members were
warned not to go after freshmen
when it comes time to pledge.

“No fraternity members are
to go and pick up freshmen at
the dorms or to be in the vicinity
of the dorm after rush dates 3
and 4,” warned Farrar.

Representatives were also
reminded that ‘‘no-contact”’
rules do not apply after a
freshman has ‘“‘torn”’ (pledged)
with a house.

Fraternity inspection lists
were handed out and are due
October 1.

The next IFC meeting will be

What The Hell’s A Ring Tum Phi

(Reprinted from the Ring-tum
Phi of Tuesday, Dec. 5, 1967)

Back in the days when
telephones (all 68 of them in
Lexington, an advertisement
boasted) were known as “‘up-to-
date electric call bells,’ back
when stealing a_bell-clapper
was called “a naughty-one’s
frolic,” in the same year that
the New York Post conferred on
this city (really) the title
“Athens of the South’’—there
came into being a little
newspaper published weekly,
“by the students for the
Washington and Lee University
community,’’ and named after
the most popular of that Univer-
sity’s football cheers: ‘‘Ring-
tum Phi.”

“Coincident with the ad-
ministration of President
Wilson begins the career of a
new publication at Washington
and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi. The
Ring-tum Phi is a weekly jour-
nal and presents a pleasing ap-

pearance. it meets a distinct
need in the University and
relieves the Collegian of what
formerly has tended only to clog
and retard.”

Literary Magazine

“The Collegian is primarily a
literary magazine, and when
the editors heretofore were
forced to cram in a limitless
number of locals, they always
bewailed the dismal incongrui-
ty. Henceforth, we rejoice to
say, the Collegian is freed from
matters of this kind, and will
not be compelled to try to serve
two ends at once...”’

“Gentlemen of the Ring-tum
Phi, you have our best wishes.
Gentlemen of the Ring-tum Phi,
we give you our sincerest
thanks. Students of W. and L.,
we congratulate you on the ad-
vent of the long needed week-
ly!”

The year was 1897. The
Southern Collegian was still a
high-quality magazine, being

published by the Graham
Literary Society. The Ring-tum
Phi was designed to be a
somewhat lighter, perhaps even
ribald, complement to the Col-
legian.

Eighteen and _ ninety-seven.
The year the football coach had
to send away for a special
noseguard ‘‘to protect the col-
ossal proboscis which ac-
companies Mr. Fitzhugh’s
countenance.”” (‘‘Mr.”’ Fitz-
hugh was a student; everybody
then was Mister or Doctor or
Professor or Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse

Eighteen and ninety-seven.
The year of the Great Hell Scan-
dal. It seems the very first
editor-in-chief, George
Houston, in the fourth issue of
the neophyte newspaper,
published a column of ‘Foot-
ball Songs,” one of which con-
cluded with this verse:

‘Each other’s back, boys,

“Has got a knack, boys,

“For making gains, sir,

‘Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sir,

“For Oberlin
player], sir,

“To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line

so awful hard.

“Then join the yell, boys,

“And yell like hell, boys,

‘Sure enough.

“To W&L U., boys,

“And foot-ball, too, boys,

“Let’s give a rousing, rumbl-
ing,

roaring football yell.

“Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,

“&c, &c.””

Well, hell broke loose. The
next issue, an incensed letter-
to-the-editor writer (we told you
things haven’t changed much)
said:

fa W&L

“There appeared in the col-

umns of the Ring-tum Phi, last
week, a song which, to the
thoughtful person had very lit-
tle to recommend it..,.The only

thing that I can see that would
have recommended it to the
editorial eye is the little smack
of naughtiness which makes the
first rhyme in the last verse.

“The Editor seems to be filled
with pride to even know the
author; he puts the verse in the
first column of his newspaper,
and writes an editorial com-
mending it as ‘especially good.’
He says the words tire the voice
very little.

“Now everyone, who knows
anything of the subject, knows
that the sound of that ‘h’ has a
very rasping effect on the vocal
chords. How much better it
would have been had the line
read: ‘And yell right well,
boys.’ It would have sounded
better, been easier on the voice,
and would have saved the

writer and Editor from showing —

off their weakness.

“It can be admitted that, to
some eyes, there is something
worthy of admiration in a dark,

An extensive search cam-
paign is underway throughout
the Valley of Virginia, in order
to locate original photographic
prints by Michael Miley—
‘*General Lee’s
photographer’’—for a major ex-
hibition next January at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The four-week show, schedul-
ed to appear in duPont Gallery,
is being researched by Mame
Warren of Rockbridge County,
and supervised by Pamela H.
Simpson of the Washington and
Lee art department.

Preliminary research has
already begun for the exhibi-
tion, according to Ms. Warren.
“We have found a number of
unique items,’’ she commented,
“but it is absolutely essential
that we encourage area
residents to dig in their attics
and drawers if the show is to be
composed entirely of original
Miley prints.”

Miley was the most noted
photographer in this area of
Virginia for some 50 years. He
first arrived in Lexington in
1866—shortly after Lee assum-
ed the presidency of
Washington College—and con-
tinued making prints almost un-
til his death in 1918.

Original prints are easily
recognized—on most of them,
‘““M. Miley” may be seen on a
front corner or the back side.
Extremely early works may be
distinguished by the words
“Boude and Miley,”’ referring
to the photographer’s partner-

ship with a local financier in the
period 1866-1870. And still others
may be marked ‘Miley and
Son,”’ dating from the 1890s,
when Miley’s son Henry entered
the family business.

An oral history by Henry
Miley, transcribed in 1941 and
now in W&L’s_ University
Library, provided a ‘‘wealth of
dates, inside family (stories),
and valuable technical informa-
tion,’’ according to Ms. Warren.
The document tells of the ad-
vanced carbon process Miley
used regularly in his work—a
technique used by no more than
a half-dozen photographers in
the entire country at that time.

Also noteworthy are Miley’s
pioneering efforts in color
photography. His color work
dates from the 1890s, and in-
cludes 100 subjects, from the
painting of the Battle of New
Market in Jackson Hall at
V.M.I. to still life photos of
flowers and bowls of peaches.
Several of these prints have
already been collected, as well
as the bowl used for the still life
photos, now owned by John
Whitesell of Brownsburg, Va.
(Whitesell, a _ relative of
Miley’s, has also uncovered a
number of fine family pic-
tures.)

“All the color prints are ex-
traordinarily well preserved,”
Ms. Warren noted. ‘‘They don’t
fade, and may not even be
recognized as photographs, soa
careful examination is
necessary.’’ She added that
scenic prints and bridal por-

traits are of particular interest
for the exhibition.

Other items already located
include Miley’s large view
camera, to be displayed with
his prints; prints of V.M.I.
historical figures Scott Shipp
and Francis Smith; and George
Marshall’s football team por-
trait from the V.M.I. class of
1901. Many other original prints
are known to exist—such as the
scenes of Lee’s funeral—but
locating the works will be near-
ly impossible without the help of
area residents.

Ms. Warren concluded that
items loaned to the university
for the exhibition would be held
about 2 months, including
several weeks necessary for the
prints to be matted, mounted
and framed. But those with
Miley originals should call in
their information as soon as
possible—either to Mame War-
ren at 703-348-5036, or to Dr.
Simpson at the W&L art depart-
ment, 463-9111, ext. 228 or 351.

New Faces In Admissions

Two men—a new Washington
and Lee University graduate
and the assistant director of ad-
missions at a college in
Alabama—were appointed ad-
missions counselors at
Washington and Lee during the
summer.

They are Peter M. Williams
of Cincinnati, who received his
B.A. degree with honors in
history last spring from
Washington and Lee, and W.
Michael Hallman, formerly
assistant admissions director at
Southern Benedictine College, a
small, Catholic liberal arts in-
stitution in Cullman, Ala.

Williams, 21, and Hallman,
24, will have substantial respon-
sibility for student recruitment
of W&L’s behalf, including
visits to secondary schools, on-
campus interviewing, and
reviewing applications for ad-
mission to Washington and Lee.

Williams was president of his
class at W&L in both his
freshman and junior years. He
was elected to Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national honorary
leadership society, in his junior
year. He was a member of
W&L’s Student Recruitment
Committee throughout his
undergraduate career and
played on the General’s tennis
team as well.

Hallman is a B.S. graduate of
the University of Alabama and
earned his master’s degree in

   

 
       
   

 
 

 

 

counselor education from the
University of Virginia last year.
He joined the admissions staff
of Southern Benedictine a year
ago as an admissions counselor
and was named assistant direc-
tor this past January.

W&L Concert Guild Announces Season

The Washington and Lee
University Concert Guild has
announced a five-concert series
for the 1979-80 season—
including the first symphony or-

chestra to be heard on the -

campus—according to Robert
Stewart, professor of music and
head of the music department
at Washington and Lee.

Opening the season on Tues-
day, Oct. 2, at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel will be the Richmond
Sinfonia, the nucleus of the
Richmond Symphony. Estab-
lished in 1973, the Sinfonia is the
only fully professional, full-time
orchestra in Virginia.

Led by French conductor Jac-
ques Houtmann, the group is
comprised of outstanding musi-
cians from conservatories and
orchestras across the country,
and has been described as a
“tightly knit, well-disciplined
ensemble, flexible in technique
and musicianship, and respon-
sive to the interpretive aims of
its conductor.”

The Sinfonia has appeared in
all areas of Virginia, and is
especially noted for its educa-
tional concerts, which have
been attended by more than
50,000 school children.

The program at Washington
and Lee will feature Clark Sut-
tle, virtuoso bassist, in the per-
formance of ‘‘Concerto for Dou-
ble Bass” by Johann Sperger.
Suttle is the assistant conductor
of the Richmond Symphony. In
addition, the orchestra will pre-
sent music by Handel, Stravin-
sky, and Tchaikovsky.

Other performers scheduled
to appear during the year in-
clude two piano soloists and

both a brass and a wind quintet.

Leon Bates, pianist, will be
seen at the Concert Guild’s se-
cond presentation on Nov. 13.

Movement Toward
Regional Music

by Mark Kinniburgh

Recently, you may have pur-
chased a record album on a
record label such as Warner
Bros., Elektra or Columbia, but
you probably didn’t even see an
album or 45 on the LIMP
records label. That is probably
because of the limited distribu-
tion of these records, but also
for another major reason, the
talent which each label offers.

What is happening all over
the music world is a move away
from the major record pro-
ducers and management, and a
move toward more regional
oriented success formulas. A
band with the appeal of the Cars
on Elektra records is an exam-
ple of a local success made good
on a national market.

The Cars were bums around
Boston, Mass. for a good while
before the backing from a ma-
jor label surfaced. In the in-
terim, however, they were very

well known on regional radio
and interested outsiders
through their practically
homemade, home _ pressed
records and demonstration
tapes.

Major record companies are
now more than ever backing
down on their search for new,
untried talent. They are going
behind successes in regional
markets, such as The
Nighthawks from_ the
Washington, D.C. area, or Exile
from Lousiville, Ky. or
Facedancer from Northern
Virginia. (Each of the above
had several albums on a small,
local label before signing with a
major label.)

Billboard magazine reports
that to produce a new band
from the street, into the recor-
ding studio, and into the record
stores can cost a minimum of
$500,000. A quality demonstra-
tion tape to use as an audition

The members of the quintet are

musicians, his achievements in- first recording of Cage’s

clude winning the prestigious
Philadelphia Orchestra compe-
tition, which gave him the op-
portunity to perform with that
group.

A second pianist, Joshua
Pierce, will present a program
on Jan. 15. A graduate of the
Manhattan School of Music, he

Lye and Ear from the Bookstore

Between the ages of 12 and 24 I kept, for

* some earnest reason, a list of every book I

read. Today, I find those notebook listings

with their varied colored inks (even purple),
appalling...

First off, I read far too fast. It was almost
as if I had a master list of Culture. So that a
classic was swallowed whole, checked off and
never opened again. Too, how much time I
had! Books were a window on the world: ac-
tual living offered very few diversions.
Reading was both retreat and recreation.
However, by far the most absurd aspect of
that long list of books is my narrow—almost
minute—range of experience within which to
place the powerful human emotions and
dread crises that I was reading about. How
could I know of murder and soul-searching
guilt when I read Crime and Punishment at
16? The self-destructive passion in Wuthering
Heights at 15? These and similar books told it
with greatness but I had no frame of
reference except a tendency to cry (secretly)

over lost love-affairs.

A marked change appears in the list after I
entered college. A high majority of the books
are out-and-out relaxation types: mystery
stories, romances and humor. The only real
carryover from the earlier years is poetry—
an addiction which I have never lost. Obvious-
ly, in college, especially as I was a science
major with long hours of lab work, textbooks
were the solid reading; lovely trash was for
pleasure.

This message from the past is an important
guide post for me in the Bookstore today. We
must offer a wide variety of recreation
reading. There must be pure delight and ex-
citing excape. But even here there are limits:
a certain level of dignity; a respect for the
= of the English language, and above all
olerance and understanding. P
healthy dash of nonsense. oe

Bands Take Up
Local Emphasis

for a major recording contract
will invariably run $10,000 after
pre-production costs, actual
studio time, engineering, mix-
ing, remixing and final pressing
or dubbing onto the final
cassette.

It appears that most of to-
day’s working bands are con-
tent to be local favorites as op-
posed to trying to make a dent
in the iron market of nationally
established rock acts. Simon
Kirke of Bad Company reveals
the secret of the hugh success of
the English rock quartet in the
same manner.

“We were wary of the big
record deals at first because
they (the record company ex-
ecutives) had no idea if we’d
last even one more gig. Actual-
ly, we all preferred to play
small clubs and halls until we
were sure that Bad Company as
a band could achieve what
would be called ‘‘commercially
successful’’ status.

Along these same guidelines,
there is a year-old rock band out
of Washington, D.C. by the
name of D. Ceats (pronounced
“deceits”). D. Ceats are the
hottest new wave band in the
metropolitan area, if not the
East coast. They are a band full
of personality and what could
be called ‘‘star-quality”’
because of the amount of
energy which they can develop
onstage backing larger draws
such as theClash on their first
U.S. tour.

D. Ceats record on Washing-

ton’s LIMP records, a label
which is very sympathetic to
the new talent in the area, and
more specifically, rock acts.
LIMP puts out 7” extended play
records which contain two
songs per side, and D. Ceats has
titled their e.p. ‘Monumental’.

Although the production is
very poor due to a limited re-
cording studio, there is an
energy and urgency that ac-
companies live performances
clearly audible on “Monumen-
tal’’.

D. Ceats put the formula to-
gether of: 1. a good, solid base
of local fans, providing an im-
mediate response to new mate-
rial; 2. a local record label will-
ing to press e.p.’s or 45’s ata
risk, and 3. talent enough to ex-
press the musical feelings that
they have to offer.

Consequently, a major re-
cording contract would be very
little risk for both the company
and the band, because each has
a type of insurance. D. Ceats
could continue making Wash-
ington fans happy for years,
even without expanding to a na-
tional level, while Warner or
Polydor could count on at least
a regional market with good
possibilities of semi- or national
acceptance.

A final note. These 7’’ extend-
ed play records are available at
most reputable record stores
for about $2.00, and they are an
excellent way to hear good local
talent while helping to support a
struggling band that someday
could be million sellers.

North

Dallas
Forty

by Dash Coufal

 

The weird part is that while
having a petty narrative
NORTH DALLAS FORTY
leaves a powerful impression:
the movie both fails and suc-
ceeds.

It fails in its attempt to to be
covertly artistic. What is meant
to be a deep and profound rela-
tionship between Nolte and his
girlfriend is hopelessly shallow
and enigmatic.

The movie’s attempts at sym-
bolism (e.g. NORTH DALLAS
FORTY: the football team is
the NORTH DALLAS BULLS,
there are forty men on the foot-
ball squad, and Nolte owns forty
acres of ranch land north of
Dallas) are clever but lack
meaning. Someone _ involved
was pushing hard for art and
failed.

The narrative is spotty. The
characters are there right from
the start rather than being in-
troduced and emerging. Much
of the first quarter of the movie
is spent in confusion trying to
figure out who’s who, with even
strong characters becoming en-
mired in confusion. In order to
catch what’s going on at first
one has to see the beginning
twice.

The movie succeeds in leav-
ing a powerful image. While the
narrative is spotty the charac-
ters are strong and resilient.
Nolte plays an aging football
receiver who is rife with con-
trasts.

On one hand he is the old pro
whose body is bent and torn,
whose hands are the best in the
business, and who risks further
injury just to give one hundred
percent. Yet he is also the cocky
youth who is overconfident, who
thinks he can buck the system,
and who plays for what he can
get out of the game.

While Nolte is the best man on
the team he is also the disrup-
tive element who first sits on
the bench, and later is purged
from the team. In the end he is
wholly the old hand who, losing
his youthful enthusiasm for the

Mock Convention Report

 

Presidential Hopeful Phil Crane Profiled

by Kevin Dwyer

Presidential campaigns have
been starting earlier every four
years than they did before. The
1980 Republican contest kicked
off in August 1978 with a very
early announcement from Rep.
Phil Crane of Northwestern
Chicago, Illinois. Crane figured
that only a start some 27 months
before the election could offset
his terminally low name recog-
nition among voters, even in II-
linois. Carter started early,
Crane figured, so I will too.

What kind of man is Phil
Crane? He and his wife Arlene,
Methodists, have eight
children. He considers himself
a born-again Christian. Crane’s
brother Dan is also a Con-
gressman from downstate.
What about Crane’s politics, the
central issue for a Presidential
candidate? Crane is more ccn-
servative than the undisputed
front runner, former California
Governor Ronald Reagan. On
most issues he has staked out
positions to the right of Reagan.
Crane honestly thinks that the
electorate’s shift to the right
since Reagan’s loss in 1976 is
enough to elect him in 1980.

For an unknown, the Crane
candidacy was achieving a
remarkable success until May
of this year, when a series of
mishaps beset the campaign.
First, Crane fired his campaign
manager, Rich Williamson.
Williamson said Crane lacked
“the commitment or capacity
to wage the sort of campaign
necessary to win.”’ At the same
time, it was revealed that New
Right direct-mail fundraiser
Richard A. Viguerie had raised
an admirable $2.3 million for
the Crane campaign, at the cost
oi over $1.8 million. Crane’s
campaign was acknowledged to
be in debt to Viguerie to the tune
of $500,000.

Following Williamson’s fir-
ing, the entire senior staff

4-

resigned. Several days '~

  

Phone 463-5985

the $2 million Viguerie mailing
list was misplaced by the cam-
paign staff. After the FBI had
been called in, the list was
discovered in the desk drawer it
was supposed to be in. Crane’s
new campaign manager, Iowan
Jerry Harkins, was revealed to
have been an unindicted co-
conspirator in one of the largest
stock frauds in Iowa history.

Enough! you say. But there is
more—and the most serious
problem Crane seems to have is
his strong-willed wife Arlene.
Reports concerning the staff fir-
ings and_ resignations
unanimously place the blame
on Arlene. “I’m even gutsier
than Betty Ford,’’ says Arlene
and her statements and actions
support her claim.

Despite the traditional
backseat role of a candidate’s
wife, this one seems determined
to run the campaign herself.
Her terming the top three aides
“the devil’s triangle’ led to
their firings and resignations.
Personal gossip about the
Cranes goes to lengths seldom
seen in politics. A vituperative
Manchester (N.H.) Union-
Leader article in March, 1979
accused the Cranes of being
sexually promiscuous, heavy
drinkers, power-mad and _in-
veterate partyers. The New
Hampshire legislature roundly
denounced the newspaper. Yet
Arlene, on politics: ‘I love it. . .
love the scheming, the power
grabs, the ego of it all.’’ Of
Williamson and the campaign
organizers, she says, ‘“‘Those
punks weren’t capable of runn-
ing a notions counter much less
a presidential campaign.’ To
quote the Washington Star:
“She is, they say, one tough
customer. In fact, Crane herself
may have gone too far with one
woman who once worked for
Crane, and a slander suit is in
preparation. Believe it or not
she calls he ‘sand “‘Philsie-
poo.”

  

Will Mrs. Crane be Mr.
Crane’s ultimate downfall?
Time will tell, but at least she
has remained in the back-
ground for sometime now.
Crane is back out on the cam-
paign trail, stressing issues like
SALT II, abortion, gun control
and taxes. And the crowds love
it. Most of them haven’t heard
the Arlene Crane horror stories.
They just know the handsome

candidate and like what he
says. And a few primary wins
on the issues can offset a lot of
gossip and maliciousness.

To quote John Connally cam-
paign chairman Eddie Mahe,
“Phil Crane is far from finished
in this campaign. We still con-
sider him a_ threat.” The
Reagan forces do not write him
off, either. Crane will get $2
million or more in federal

Two million can do a lot to pay
debts, of course, but it can do
more in the last few minutes of

primary campaigning. If he can
keep things settled and keep his
wife’s mouth shut Phil Crane
may surprise Connally,
Reagan, and a lot of other peo-
ple who relegate him to the
lunatic fringe.

weeks.

Abraham said that no’ new
trial date had been set as of
Tuesday evening and would not
answer any further questions
about the case.

Cold Check

In other business during Mon-
day night’s first EC meeting of
the academic year, the Cold
Check Committee was allowed
to raise its fining power from $5
to $10 for the first bad check, $10
to $20 for the second bad check,
and from $25 to $30 for the third
bad check.

Jim Vines, chairman of the
Cold Check Committee, made it
clear that he and his committee
would take a_ hard-line ap-
proach this year toward stu-
dents who write bad checks.

“The people who bounce a lot
of checks are 50 percent of our
business, which was about
$4,000 last year,”’ Vines told the
EC.

“In the past, in my opinion,
the Cold Check Committee has
been too lax”’ in fining repeat of-
fenders, Vines said

The purpose of the increased
fine, Vines said, ‘‘is to keep it
from being a discount fine for
the students’? who know the
Cold Check Committee will
cover their checks for a smaller
fine than the banks or many
businesses in town would im-
pose.

Vines said that he especially
hoped the increased fines would
stop ‘“‘people from floating
checks hoping to get a deposit
from their parents before the
check bounces. That’s a really
bad habit,”’ he said.

Not voted on by the EC was
another request by Vines that
he be given permission to
distribute lists to merchants in
town of those students barred
from obtaining credit because
they had a history of bouncing
checks.

Vines also requested that the
statute of limitations for first,
second, and third offenders be
raised from one year to two. (If
a student does not bounce
another check within that
period, his record would be
wiped clean.) But the EC dead-
locked 5-5 on the: proposal and
the motion failed.

Cockpit Bands

The University Center Com-
mittee was advanced $500 to
finalize its plans for booking the
All-Stars band in the Cockpit
the night of Thursday, Oct. 4.

To help pay for the band, a $1
cover charge will probably be
charged either at the door or
through advanced ticket sales.
It was also not clear whether
the All-Stars would play one
show or two.

During his request for the
money for the All-Stars Jamie
Small, chairman of the Univer-
sity Center Committee, lashed
into Jerry Darrell, director of
university food services (which
includes the Cockpit), for not
having given ‘“‘any money in the
past for bands in the Cockpit.”’

‘‘He made $1,000 in beer sales
the night the Nighthawks
played (last year),’’ Small said.

“He (Darrell) makes more
money in cne night with a band
than he would make in a week
without one,”’ Small continued.

He said he felt the Cockpit
should ‘‘kick in”’ to help pay for
the band.

But Burr Datz, former assis-
tant manager of W&L food ser-
vices and the man who helped
put most of the bands in the
Cockpit last year, refuted much
of what Small said.

“IT remember in the case of
the Jack Skinner Band from
California that the Cockpit paid
$70 to help make up for the
guaranteed price not met in
cover charge collections,’’ Datz
said when asked about Small’s
statements.

He said he also- recalled
another instance where the

Cockpit threw in $40-$50 to a
band to make up the difference
between the guaranteed pay-
ment and the cover charge
take.

Datz also cited food and
refreshments provided to band
members by the Cockpit.

“Jamie is under a misconcep-
tion,” he said. “To say that
Jerry Darrell makes money in
there (the Cockpit) hand over
fist is wrong. He does a lot that
just can’t be measured in
dollars and cents.”’

S.A.B.

Also at the EC meeting
Abraham verbally spanked the
Student Activities Board for not
having given notice of their
meeting last Sunday night.

SAB chairman Bill Ridge said
that it had just been “an in-
troductory meeting,’’ strictly
for the SAB members to get ac-
quainted with each other, and
that nothing important happen-
ed.

Ridge and his co-chairman
David Harpole then went on to
report about the Homecoming
weekend activities for Friday,
Oct. 5. The bands Sandcastle
and The Catalinas will play
beginning at 8 p.m. in Doremus
Gym. They were reportedly
booked last year because
Homecoming comes so early
this year.

The EC also adopted the
following statement:

“The Honor System applies
fully to the University Library,
Evans Dining Hall, and the Law
School Library. Students are
advised to become familiar
with the procedures of each and
abide by them.”’

Price War In Lexington?
No, Just Lower Beer Prices

by Dick Moss

While everyone’s denying it,
there does seem to be a beer keg
price war going on in Lex-
ington.

Of the five major stores in-

volved in the beer keg business: -

East Lexington Grocery: Red
Front; Central Lunch; Lee’s
Corner; and the Paramount
Inn, at least three have lowered
either some or all of their prices
for the duration of Rush.

Jim Bowen, manager of the
East Lexington Grocery, said
that while he has lowered his
prices on Old Milwaukee and
Black Label kegs, he does not
think that a price war, as such,
is occuring. He did admit.
however, that ‘‘everyone’s
scrounging around to get the

business” that has suddenly
grown with the closing of Clyde
Mull’s College Inn.

Jim Greene of Lee’s Corner
Restaurant also denied that
there was a price war, but he
too stated that things were “‘up
in the air’’ as far as the fraterni-
ty keg business went.

The Paramount Inn, which
purchased Clyde Mull’s conces-
sion and records, according to
Wayne Hartless had to lower
their prices to compete with ‘‘a
certain place” (which he would
not name), which is “‘selling its
kegs at only one to two dollars
profit, rather than the usual
five’.

Elizabeth McKemy of the Red
Front Grocery Store, said
merely, ‘‘I don’t think we’re ina
price war.”

Mr. Duck of Central Lunch
said, ‘“‘ I haven’t changed my
prices since last year, and I
don’t intend to. I just don’t do
business that way.”’

One of the cheaper beer keg
buys in town last year was Old
Milwaukee at the College Inn
for thirty dollars.. When this
figure is taken into account,
along with the 13% inflation
rate of the economy over the

summer, and the prices givenin ©

the price chart below, the

results are interesting.

At any rate, if you start doing

keg business this Rush, be

prepared, because after Rush,
after exactly who is doing
business with whom has been
settled, prices may very well go
up.

Randolph--Macon
Women’s College
in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Over the mountain in Lynch-
burg, Randolph Macon
Women’s College looms in the
distance complete with pines
house parties, Smith Hall mix-
ers, The Dell and about 750
women.

Those who brave this 40-mile
drive on Route 501, also will find
off-campus night spots, Lynch-
burg College, ‘‘The Texas
Tavern’’, in addition to ‘‘Randy
Mac’’, or ‘“‘Macon Bacon’’, as
known to those blessed with suc-
cess there.

Security at RMWC has
noticeably increased. New
alarms now guard dormitory
doors traditionally known as
easy entrances and a larger, all
new, beefed-up security force
makes its presence known
throughout the campus.

Parietal violators will be
dealt harsher punishments, so
they say, with automatic pro-
secution for  tresspassing.
Father Time advises sneeking
up the fire escapes. ‘‘Just don’t
park in the fire lanes.”’

Parking is frequently your
first problem. The best bet is to
get there early and to look for a
space in the main lot. You will
be ticketed if you park on the
Main front drive as well as on
surrounding streets.

Once on campus, the next
‘wall of defense comes when you
enter one of the dormitories and
are met by a quiet, sometimes
annoyed, ‘‘guard’’ who watches
the sign-book, listens to your
phone calls and forbids you to
walk past her until your escort
arrives. Once properly signed
in, you are free to go.

Your date, according to the

A Freshman’s

Guide To The

rules, should be at your side at
all times. She’s the one who gets
to yell ‘man in the hall”
everytime you-round a corner
Hallmates upon such_notioe
then usually peek through thei:
doors and giggle.

Visiting hours are posted al
all dormitory entrances. Week
end parietals are longer. Then
you can stay until one or two.
During the week though, it’s out
by 11:00. These hours ensure
that no hanky-panky goes on.
After all, everyone knows that
“that activity’’ only goes on in
the wee hours of the morning.

Pine House parties are usual-
ly free. Mixers are not. Three
dollars per person is standard
plus a quarter per beer.

Sometimes you will get the
feeling that you are paying for
everything. How ludicrous!
Fraternities bring free beer for
all at the ‘‘pines’’. Mixers are
different though. The entrance
fee and extra charge for beer
surely must go to pay clean-up
costs and the price of getting
your hand stamped at the door.

Macon offers a diverse crowd
of ‘intellectual’? women. Con-
versations range from sugges-
tively stimulating to rather
amusing. Dress is varied but
undoubtedly someone will com-
ment on your outfit whether in
front of you or behind your
back. An entertaining evening
certainly can be had by all.

After the party, well it’s back
to beautiful Lexington, over the
mountain where many have lost
their lunch as well as hub caps
at Horseshoe Bend. Many ques-
tion why we go down the road.
After all, we are located in the
beautiful Shenandoah Valley
where Washington and Lee
gentlemen have little problem
finding dates.

The History Of Beer— In The Beginning

According to Chinese legend,
its creation was decreed by
heaven. Egyptian mythology
credits the gods Iris and Osiris
as having been the first to make
it. An Assyrian tablet of 2000
B.C. relates that it was one of
the provisions taken aboard the
Ark. And in the University of
Pennsylvania Museum, a slen-
der golden straw on display is
said to have been used by Queen
Shubad of Mesopotamia to sip it
in royal celebration.

The subject, of course, is
beer—one of mankind’s oldest
occupations and enjoyments.

But what is this mysterious
brew? What had Isis wrought?
What goes into this (usually)

amber liquid which today fol-
lows only coffee, soft drinks and

the American adult? The fact is
that despite the popularity of
this ancient beverage—more
than 160 million barrels of beer
were consumed in the United
States in 1978—few beer buffs
know much about its origins or
the art of brewing.

It is believed that contrary to
the usual course of cultural
migration, the consumption of
beer and the knowledge of
brewing were not transmitted
from one race or nation to
another. Brewing developed in-
dependently among several,
separate agricultural peoples,

beer being made from practi-
cally any grain but primarily
barley.

By the time Alexander the
Great was moving from Mace-
donia to the world, brewing had
developed among most peoples
on the continents of Europe,
Asia and Africa. Brewing ex-
panded even further through
the Middle Ages, but beers of
ancient times and even of the
Middle Ages were not like beers
of today. Generally a sweetish
beverage then, beer was often
mixed with pungent spices to
make it more palatable.

But perhaps the biggest ad-
vance in the brewing process
was the introduction into the

brew of hops, an ingredient that
added aroma to beer and also
served as a preservative. Hops
were used first in brewing by
the Finns of ancient times, but
were not used again until the
ninth century inGermany.

Lagered or aged beer, which
originated in Germany in the
eighth century, was a brew that
was allowed to ferment and
ripen at low temperatures,
brought to a mellow maturity
and enlivened with natural car-
bonation. Originally, because of
the cold temperatures needed,
it had to be brewed in the winter
and stored in caves.

While Germans brewed with
hops seven centuries before

most other nations, England
followed suit in the 1500s. Enor-
mous quantities of hopped
English beer were exported to

the continent, especially
France.
Ale, however, which was

believed to have originated in
England, was still brewed
without hops. This was at a time
when approximately 13 million
barrels of beer were consumed
annually in England, which had
a population of just over five
million.

The colonization of America
developed new markets and
gave a marked increase to the
production of beer in England.

From the Pressbox:

Winning Soccer?

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

This could be the year. After five years of mediocri-
ty, it looks like the soccer Generals have come alive.

While the W&L football team was down at Emory &
Henry losing its second game of the year, the 1979 ver-
sion of the W&L soccer team opened its regular
season Saturday with an impressive 2-1 victory over
the Hampden-Sydney Tigers on Wilson Field. The
Generals were led by junior forward Mark Turner
who scored both W&L goals and by tri-captains Doug
Seitz, Dana Samuelson and Doug Dorsey (who each
played an outstanding two-way game. )

But individual praise seems unimportant to this
year’s soccer team. Saturday’s win was a total team
effort. Team play is emphasized and has become an
effective weapon used by Coach Rolf Piranian.

“This is a much more balanced team than I’ve had
in the past. We have a very cohesive group and the
captains have done an outstanding job,’”’ explained
Piranian after the game.

Piranian attributes much of the improvement of
this year’s squad to the development of the upper-
class players, the leadership of the tri-captains and
the addition of several good freshman players. “We
have some talented freshmen who are playing well,”’
said the General coach, adding, ‘‘this has been a big
plus for us.”’

And there has been improvement—vast improve-
ment. Improvement in team offense. Improvement in
team defense. Improvement in all-around team hus-
ile. The passing game was crisp and accurate while
the stubborn General defense stymied the Sydney at-
tack. Except for one short lapse in the second half,
W&L dominated every facet of the game and played
almost flawless soccer.

Another improvement has been in their goalkeep-
ing. Junior Kevin Carney has developed into a
capable and dependable goalkeeper for W&L. He is
presently chasing the school record for most career
saves.

Although soccer is not my favorite spectator sport
(I’ve always preferred football and hockey), it was a
pleasure to watch the Generals play Saturday. They
were explosive and exciting. And from the cheers I
heard in the bleachers, I would assume the other 150
or so fans who watched the game would agree. It’s a
shame more of you weren't out there...but that’s
another story altogether.

Anyway, Washington and Lee University has a good
soccer team this year. They played a superb game
against Sydney and hopefully they played just as well

 

Tailback Stewart Atkinson will be in action this Saturday as the Generals entertain Centre College.
Atkinson is the Generals’ leading ground gainer.

Generals Lose 12-6;
Atkinson Gains 164

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

Leo Durocher, the elder
statesman of baseball
managers, once said, ‘‘nice
guys finish last.’’ Leo Durocher
cbviously had W&L football in
mind when he uttered those in-
famous words.

Head coach Gary Fallon is a
nice guy—too nice to have a
career record of 2-10 after last
Saturday’s 12-6 loss to Emory &
Henry. Let Woody Hayes or Bo
Schembechler lose’ every
Saturday—they‘re poor enough
sports to deserve so.

The General’s record slipped
to 0-2 after last week’s game, a
loss in which the Generals made
only a handful of mistakes and
shut out the Wasps for three
quarters of the game. The
Generals led in every offensive
category except one—the score.

‘“‘We got ourselves in an early
hole,”’ said Fallon. ‘‘Our drives
were Stalled and we couldn’t get
those needed inches. We domi-
nated the game,’ added the
coach, ‘‘except for twice when
Jimmy Wenke was stopped in-

 

ches short of a first down and
Stewie Atkinson was stopped
short ‘‘.

The Generals started the
game with the same mistake-
prone football that resulted in
last week’s 30-0 rout. On the se-
cond play of the game, starting
qui ick Rich Hachenburg
fumoled on the W&L 27 to set up
the first E&H touchdown.
Wenke replaced Hachenburg
later in the quarter.

On their second possession of
the game, the Wasps moved 99
yards in 15 plays to boost their
lead to 12-0. That ended the
scoring in the first half as the
Generals found themselves shut
out for the fifth and sixth
straight quarters.

The second half was a dif-
ferent story. Atkinson, who had
picked up 63 yards rushing in
the first half, exploded for 101 in
the second half to put W&L back
in the game.

“It was Stewie’s best per-
formance,” said Fallon of
Atkinson, who carried the ball

38 times without fumbling. Not
only did Atkinson not fumble,
but the entire team committed
only three turnovers—a far cry
from the week before. °

Still, the Generals could only
produce six points despite roll-
ing up 266 yards on offense. The
reason was simple—W&L could
not move the ball for short yard-
age on fourth down.

In the fourth quarter, Atkin-
son was stopped short on fourth
and two with the ball on the
E&H 26. Another drive was
stopped deep in Wasp territory
after a Wenke interception.

One of the standouts was
backup quarterback Wenke,
who probably earned the star-
ting slot for this Saturday’s
game against Centre College.

Fallon described Centre as
being ‘‘a physical team, quick
and aggressive. They have a
breakaway threat on offense
and two standout performers in
their defensive secondary,”
said the coach.

Kickoff time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Dove Hunting
In Rockbridge

by Jim Feinman

The first half of a split dove
season opened in Virginia on
September 8, with the. Rock-
bridge County area offering
good dove hunting for
Washington and Lee students.

The season will run through
November 3, at which time it
will close and re-open Decem-
ber 22-January 3. Shooting is
allowed after 12 noon and the
daily limit is 12 birds.

In Rockbridge, the dairy
country to the north and the
James and Maury River basins
are choice areas. Many hunters
who were able to find harvested
corn fields during the first week
of the season reported plenty of
birds and quick limits. Other
hunters, however, were frus-
trated in finding a field to hunt
as a late growing season has left
standing corn in more than one
nimrod’s favorite field.

All hunters should be sure to
secure the landowner’s permis-
sion before taking to the field.
Most landowners are receptive
if approached in a polite and
considerate manner. Outdoors-
men, especially W&L students,
should treat hunting property

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer Generals played a good first
half in yesterday’s match on
Wilson Field. The second half
was a different story.

The Generals, who had
played well enough to earn a 1-1
first half deadlock with Division
II West Virginia Wesleyan,
were outscored 4-1 in the final
period to end up on the short
side of a 5-2 decision.

‘‘We made some defensive er-
rors,” said a very disappointed
coach Rolf Piranian. ‘‘We show-
ed we could play with those
guys and we never quit,”’ com-
mented the coach.

‘he contest was started be-
fore only 20 spectators, half of
which were other athletes
waiting for their own practice to
begin. The crowd later ‘‘swell-
ed”’ to over 50 but the game was
decided by then.

Wesleyan started the scoring
with the game not quite five
minutes old. Martin Woodstock

ly eluded W&L goalie Kevin

Four Goal Half

Soccer Team

right hand corner of the net.

The Generals retaliated five
minutes later on a penalty kick
by Brian Williams. Williams
was given a free shot when a
Wesleyan defender was called
on a hand ball penalty in front of
his net.

W&L was able to keep the
game deadlocked thanks to
some strong defense by Carney
and his teammates. On one se-
quence, Carney was caught out
of the net but stopped a point-
blank shot whose rebound was
headed away from the goal by
the ever-present Williams.

Unfortunately for the
Generals, no such luck prevail-
ed in the second half. It took the
visitors only two minutes to net
their second goal, a 10-yard chip
shot by Matt Engle that crossed
the goal diagonally.

Three minutes later, Engle
netted his second goal of the
game by scoring in almost the
same way. Wesleyan now had a
3-1 lead and was seemingly in
control of the game.

“That third goal broke our

backs,”’ said Piranian. ‘‘It look-
ed like the man (Engle) was off-
sides, but you can’t rely on that
as an excuse.”

Not content with only two
goals, Engle picked his way
through the Generals’ weaken-
ing defense for his third and
fourth goals of the afternoon.
Wesleyan moved ahead 4-1 at
the 10-minute mark and added
their fifth goal at the 15-minute
mark.

W&L was able to make the
score look semi-respectable by
adding one more goal less than
a minute later. Ben Muskin
scored on a deflection of Tad
Renner’s shot to end the scoring
at 5-2.

Despite a _ losing _ per-
formance, Piranian still has
faith in his team’s ability. “I
believe that we can win as long
as we play a good game against
every team,” stated the coach.

The Generals’ next game is
Wednesday, September 26,
against the University of Rich-
mond. The match will be held at
Richmond and game time is
3:00 p.m.

Water Polo Begins

by Dave Johnson

The 1979 W&L water polo
team opens its season next
weekend with the Johns Hop-
kins Invitational Tournament.
The two-day tournament, which
will be held at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Sept.
28-29, is one of six tournaments
in which the water polo
Generals will compete this fall.

Unlike most W&L varsity
teams, the water polo squad
plays only in tournaments, with
no dual matches on the sched-
ule. This is due to the large
distances between collegiate
water polo teams here on the
East Coast.

The team enters this season
with a new coach and a lot of op-
timism and desire. The new
coach, Page Remillard, comes
to W&L from California, which
is the water polo capital of the
world. Last season, as coach at
Claremont Men’s College in
Claremont, CA, Remillard com-
piled a 20-8 record against top

national competition, while tak-
ing the conference champion-
ship.

Remillard is outspoken and
extremely positive concerning
his views on water polo and on
the way it should be coached.
He feels that his time is best
spent on the pool deck coaching
his players, and not in the office
dealing with the administrative
duties that plague coaches of
every sport. To this end, he is
engaging several students who
are interested in taking over
some of this administrative
work, including recruiting,
keeping statistics and manag-
ing finances.

W&L has consistently finish-
ed second to Richmond in the
Virginia State Championships
over the past several years.
Last year the team posted an
impressive 15-9 record in the
highly competitive Southern
Water Polo Conference. Led by
senior co-captains Mike Foley

Hoke Wins
Scholarship

 

Harry Franklin ‘‘Chip”’ Hoke,
III, a four-year All-American
swimmer at Washington & Lee
and a June honor graduate of
the University, was awarded a
$1,500 NCAA _ Post-Graduate
Scholarship this summer.

Hoke, a resident of Rich-
mond, Va., and 1975 graduate of
St. Christopher’s High,
becomes the sixth Washington
& Lee student-athlete since 1970
to receive the coveted award.
He joins Bill Brotherton (W&L
‘75) as the only W&L swimmers
to win the scholarship.

“Chip had an_ outstanding
career at W&L, academically
and athletically, and is most
deserving of this prestigious
scholarship,” said W&L athletic
director and physical education
chairman William D. McHenry.
“As an All-American swimmer
and straight-A student, Chip
represented the University in a
manner with which we are all

- proud and pleased.”’

Hoke: won six varsity letters

at W&L, four in swimming and
two in water polo. He received
All-American swimming honors
in the 1650-yard freestyle event
(senior year), and 800 freestyle
relay (freshman, sophomore,
and junior years), and the 500
freestyle (sophomore year).
Hoke helped the Generals attain
three top-ten national rankings
in swi ing and a pair of second-
place state finishes in water
polo.

Hoke graduated second in a
class of 305 this past June, earn-
ing summa cum laude honors
for his 3.95 grade point average.
At W&L’s’ commencement
ceremonies, Hoke received the
Algernon Sydney Sullivan
Medallion, awarded by the
faculty to the graduate who ex-
cels in high living ideals,
‘spiritual qualities, and
generous service to others.

Hoke, 22, is included in Who’s
Who in American Colleges and
Universities, and was inducted
into Phi Beta Kappa, the na-
tional scholarship fraternity,
and Omicron Delta Kappa, the
national honorary leadership
fraternity founded at
Washington and Lee in 1914. In
addition, he served as vice-
president of the W&L chapter of
Lambda Chi Alpha.

A mathematics/physics ma-
jor, Hoke will use his scholar-
ship at the University of North
Carolina, where he plans to ob-
tain his doctorate in
mathematics.

Lax Team Opens Fall Practice

by Kip Gordon

Although the season opener is
still many months away, pre-
paration for W&L’s number one
spectator sport is already well
under way.

On September 12, the lacrosse
Generals commenced a four-
week practice session in which
new talent is being evaluated
and fundamentals reviewed, as
recruitment and fall practice
are vital steps toward the final
product which is showcased in
the spring.

Seventy-five players are com-
peting for positions on the 1980
W&L lacrosse team. Thirty-five
freshmen, about a dozen. of
whom were recruited, reported
to fall practice. Of the 35, Em-
mer expects about 10 to make
the varsity squad.

The first week of fall practice
was devoted entirely to the
freshmen for a period of evalua-
tion which one freshman
described as ‘‘vigorous and in-
tense.’’ Lacrosse fans can get
their first look at the rookies on
October 14 in a game against

Under Remillard

( continued from page 11);

‘and Biff Martin, along with

fellow senior Drew Pillsbury,
the team and its coach have
high hopes for this season.
Although he falls short of
making any actual predictions,
it is obvious from talking with
Remillard that he is very confi-
dent in his players and is op-
timistic about W&L’s chances
of capturing the conference
championship in his first year
here. The key to this goal will be
to defeat Richmond, the peren-
nial powerhouse in this area.
East Carolina is also expected
to present the Generals stiff

competition.

Remillard is convinced that
water polo is on the rise in the
Bast as a major intercollegiate
sport. He is insistent that he and
the W&L water polo team will
play a large part in that rise.

There is a long road to be
traveled before reaching the
Southern Water Polo Con-
ference Championships, which
will be held here at W&L,
November 2-3. Considering the
attitude, talent and energy ex-
hibited by the coach and
players alike, that road could
quite possibly be a bright and
pleasant one.

the Roanoke College freshmen
which will be played on Wilson
Field. The game will provide
the coaching staff with a view of
the new talent under game

situations before the squad is .

trimmed to 45 for pre-season
practice which begins in
February.

The annual Alumni game,
always the highlight of fall
lacrosse, is scheduled for Oc-
tober 7. It will feature the 24
returning veterans of last

year’s varsity as well as a
number of. highly-talented

 

alumni. The game will be
played, as it is every year, on
Wilson Field.

In spite Of the large fall tur-
nout this year, the familiar
question remains: Can
Washington and Lee lacrosse

continue to compete against the
larger schools without the aid of
athletic scholarships? Coach
Emmer himself is uncertain
about the future and said, ‘‘As’
long as we can stay com-
petitive, we’ll keep playing
Division I lacrosse.”

Basketball Team Travelling To Europe

by Bill Whalen
Asst. Sports Editor

Last Spring we reported on a
certain W&L sports team’s
plans to travel to Europe. We
were not joking.

The basketball Generals are
definitely going to Europe over
Christmas vacation. Following
the tour of Europe, the team
will rest in Nassau for a few
days and then return to the
mainland for a tournament in
Florida.

There is only one problem
with a trip of this magnitude—
money. To get the players,
coaches and the rest of the en-
tourage through the tour, the
cost will be approximately
$25,000.

“We're about 70 percent of
the way there” said assistant
coach Jim Casciano. If this is
true, that would give the team a
total of between $17,000 and
$18,000 leaving them almost
$8,000 short of their goal.

To earn the extra money, the
team has several projects set
up. Among the top three possi-
bilities are a raffle for a vaca-
tion in Myrtle Beach, S.C., a
raffle for a ‘“‘basket of cheer’

(full of beer and liquors) and
possibly a raffle for a chance to
travel with the team.

Casciano also mentioned two
other gimmicks. The team
might hold a ‘‘24-hour running

marathon’’ or sponsor a
“eoncert out at Zollman’s
Pavillion.”

The entire touring group will
consist of 20 players, three
coaches, one trainer and 12
other people making a total of

38. The players, who each had to
raise $625 this summer (plus
$200 out of their own pockets),
will be selling raffle tickets at
this Saturday’s football game.

As of this writing, 12 seats
were still available to anyone
who wants to travel to Europe
with the Generals. The cost of
the trip would be approximately

$900 and does not cover the trip
to the Bahamas and Florida.
Anyone interested should get in
touch with Casciano or Head
Coach Verne Canfield.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Miscarriage of Justice

Several weeks ago now, an Evans Dining Hall con-
struction worker made an apparent attempt to break
into a female law student’s room. That’s good jour-
nalistic form for saying that the guy broke down the
woman’s window screen and may have actually en-
tered her room through the window. We will never
know for sure because the frightened student fled her
room to take refuge elsewhere with a friend. She had
been bothered before by the workman and did not
want to take her chances again.

What is important about this case is that today,
over two weeks after the incident, the man has not
been prosecuted and no charges are even pending
against him. ‘In order to press charges and pro-
secute,’’ Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. Read
told our reporter John Billmyre, ‘‘an intent to commit
crimes prior to the offense of break-in must be

established.”’

What legalese is this? There are a number of nag-
ging questions in this most bizarre case. Perhaps
there is not enough evidence to prosecute the intruder
on charges of attempted rape, but could he not have
been prosecuted for destruction of private property?
Why were no finger or footprints taken by the Lex-
ington police when they arrived on the scene? The
most nagging question of all is why is this man still
roaming the streets as if he had done nothing wrong?

The Commonwealth’s Attorney claims that ‘‘a
pecularity”’ in Virginia law prevented him from pro-
secuting the worker for the break-in and he hinted
that the reason the Lexington police department was
unable to positively identify the man for destruction
of property was their gross ineptitude. But, in the true
tradition of bureaucratic buck passing, Chief of
Police James A. Kirby says that it was Read’s deci-
sion not to prosecute, while Read claims that both
men had a hand in deciding to do nothing.

Meanwhile, the only group to take any decisive ac-
tion was the University, which told the worker that he
would no longer be allowed on school property—a
move that had the effect of firing him from his job.

We find this whole situation very disturbing. A
potentially dangerous man is still prowling the streets
of Lexington while the police and Commonwealth’s
Attorney sit idly by. And we cannot help wondering if
this city’s law enforcement officials wouldn’t be bet-
ter occupied if they devoted more time to criminals
than parking tickets and noise violations.

Getting Dumped

Persiflage

It’s amazing how insensitive some people can be. Here I sit, emo-
tionally crushed, and the only thing these journalists can think of is
their deadlines. These alleged human beings expect me to crank
out the words after having gone through a devastating and
traumatic experience. Evidently, a broken heart isn’t a good
enough excuse to get out of writing for this rag sheet.

Look, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t talk this way. It’s just that I’m very
distraught.

She was everything to me. Although she had the intelligence of a
toaster, she made up for it in other ways. Her acrobatic body and
rabbit-like inclinations might not have been enough for some peo-
ple, but I’ve never been a snob.

We used to go everywhere together. My room, her room, a motel,
a car—it didn’t matter to us. Ours was a love that seemed capable
of enduring the strain of time.

Alas, it was not to be. While we were apart this summer she
began to change. On my return to school she told me that she had to
be alone for awhile, that she had to find herself. Maybe it was the
way that I laughed in her face that made her suspect that I wasn’t
very sympathetic to her emotional needs.

Anyway, it ended just a few days ago. She’s going on to major in
dance while touring Europe with Daddy’s American Express card.
Me? Well, I’m just sitting here with a six-pack, a naive young
freshman girl and a lot of imagination, trying to kill the pain.

Has Social Security Become The
Nation’s Largest Welfare System

Donald Lambro

With all the pious rhetoric swirling about the social
security system, no one seems able to summon forth
the courage to say out loud what a few economists
have now realized, namely, that for many young,
middle- and upper income Americans just entering
the labor force, social security’s retirement program
is arotten investment.

Certainly, for retired workers and those ap-
proaching retirement, social security remains a
bargain. These workers have been taxed at the
substantially lower rates of the past while their total
future benefits have been raised far out of proportion
to what they have contributed into the fund.

For example, a 25-year-old man who began work in
1937, when the program began, upon retirement in
1978 had paid in a maximum employee share of only
$8,728. Today, this worker is receiving a monthly
benefit check: of $459.80, or $5517.60 per year. At this
rate he will recover his payments in less than 32
months—assuming they earned interest at the time
they were taxed, at 5 percent per year compounded
annually. If the worker is married with a spouse age
65 or older, his monthly check is $689.70, and it will
take only twenty-one months to recoup his share of
the social security tax plus the interest his money
would have earned over forty years.

increases to 6 percent, the couple’s annual social
security taxes in three years will climb to $2,803. By
1981, their total employer-employee tax will be $5,506.

Each year the social security fund receives nearly
$112 billion from 110 million workers. And each month
it sends out almost $5 billion in checks to 21.5 million

But the option of staying out of social security is
available only to people who work for the govern-
ment—like members of Congress and federal civilian
workers—and for those who are privileged enough to
work for nonprofit organizations.

State and local governments also are able to

But most workers live considerably longer than
these payments would allow. Today the rest of the
retired worker’s benefits come out of the earnings of
the nation’s current work force. This is why social
security is anything but an insurance or pension
scheme: It is the nation’s largest welfare program.

The story is considerably different, however, for
those just beginning their working lives. These
workers—people who have been working for several
years and those just getting started—will be paying

vastly more in social security taxes than they can
ever expect to recoup in pension benefits during their
retirement years.

When social security’s retirement provisions are
examined it is clear the plan is an abysmal invest-
-ment for young workers. They are finding, par-
ticularly this year, that sharply rising payroll taxes
are expropriating bigger chunks of their weekly in-
come. Under the tax rate hikes enacted by Congress
in 1977, social security levies will eat up nearly 14 per-
cent of all payrolls by 1987, compared with less than
two percent in 1940. It is no wonder that today, among
all federal, state, and local taxes, the bite of social
security is second in size to that of the federal income
tax.

On January 1, 1979, workers found that the max-
imum tax had shot up from $1.070.85 to $1,403.77. That
is because the payroll tax rose this year from 6.05
percent to 6.15 percent and total wages subject to
social security taxes went up from $17,000 to $22,900.

This sharp escalation, however, is only the beginn-
ing. Social security taxes as set by Congress are due
to rise dramatically in the years ahead in order to
finance expanded benefits for an ever increasing
number of beneficiaries. By 1981 the maximum
employee share of the tax will be $1975.05, compared
to the $374.40 maximum that workers paid in 1970,
and taxes for workers earning the maximum taxable
income will nearly triple in the next decade.

Married working couples will be among the hardest
hit‘in terms of their total tax bite. For a couple, each
earning $17,700, the combined social security tax last
year was $2,141. Their employers’ matching tax
payments, which after all are paid on their behalf,
pushed their annual total to $4,283. Allowing salary

As this table illustrates, the percentage of
both the employee and employer contribu-
tions to Social Security has increased
dramatically over the past several years with

the percentage of contribution and the tax-
able earnings limit being pushed ever higher
each year. Social Security levies will eat up
nearly 14 percent of all payrolls by 1987.

 

retirees, $1.5 billion for 7.6 million widows and
children, and $900 million for 4.8 million disabled. It
also pays out an average of $1.4 billion per month in
medicare payments to 9.6 million recipients.

Best To Get Out

A relatively small number of economists have
finally begun to question the program’s true value as
a retirement plan for moderate- and upper-income
Americans in the years ahead. Is social security a
good buy for these and other Americans? Jodie Allen,
once an analyst for a Washington economic research
firm and now a top assistant to Labor Secretary Ray
Marshall, is one of the few to have spoken frankly
about it: “Social Security is no longer as good a buy
as it once was for the average, relatively well-paid
worker,” she said. ‘Anyone who can legally do so,’’
she added, ‘‘will do well to opt for his own private
system of retirement benefits.”

withdraw from social security, and since 1970 more
than 477 separate groups have taken themselves out
of the system. Another 284 muneipalities have given
notice of their intention to withdraw.

San Jose, Calif., is one community that has with-
drawn and had added benefits to its own pension plan
which, a city official siad, ‘‘provides better benefits
than by continuing in social security.”’

Employer’s Share

Figuring out whether the social security retirement
component is a good buy in and of itself, depends
largely upon whether an employee counts his employ-
er’s matching tax share when computing the overall
return on his or her “investment.”

Robert Myers, formerly chief actuary for the
Social Security Administration, believes strongly

Social Security Has Become A Rotten Investment

that it is ‘dead wrong”’ to include the employer’s
share because, he says, that money “should be con-
sidered as being pooled for the general benefit of all
covered workers in the system.”

Most economists, however, disagree. Rudolph Pen-
ner, director of tax policy studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, correctly argues that the em-
ployer’s matching share is paid on the worker’s
behalf and that some share of it, if not all, must be
considered payment in lieu of wages. In other words,

If this worker, at age 65, were to take just his own
investment payments and buy a life insurance annui-

bearing account during his working years. The pre-
sent value of his benefits-to-taxes figures out to 94.4
percent, however, als close to a break-even point. If
this worker bought the same type of annuity with his
invested payments, at retirement he would receive
an annual income of $104,714, or $21,854 more per
year than social security would pay.

Even figures compiled by the social security
system’s own actuaries indicate that the program is
not a good buy for a single male worker, age 22, who
always earns at least the maximum wage base on
which the payroll tax is levied. Using their figures,
the present value of that individual’s benefits upon
retirement as projected for the year 2022—will only
be 35 percent of the present value of the social securi-

generation would find that its initial net Social Securi-
ty wealth was negative....Each generaltion would
pay taxes with a greater present value than the
benefits it received.”’

The Harvard economists said that of 150 million
Americans 18 years of age or older, about 50 million
have negative net social security wealth. Older peo-
ple have a positive net social security wealth
‘because they are closer to receiving benefits and
have fewer taxpaying years left.”

In another study, June O’Neill, a Congressional
Budget Office economist, sets the real rate of return,
adjusted for inflation, for those now entering the
system at between 1 percent and 2.2 percent for mar-
ried couples, with a negative return for single men.

In a paper presented to the American Economic
Association O'Neill said the rate of return on social
security investment over the long haul “is expected
to fall below 2 percent in real terms for workers retir-
ing over the next 75 years.” Her figures are based
solely on the retirement tax plus survivors’ benefits.

Greater amounts of income will have to be taken

Establishment circles have been able to dismiss
out of hand every proposal that would allow optional
modifications according to some ‘‘investment’’ for-
mula. Such highhandedness would not be possible if
the public were aware of these alternatives and their
implications. If people understood that they could
achieve greater wealth if they were able to invest
their social security contributions—perhaps grand-
fathering in everyone who prefers the present pro-
gram and giving only new workers the option to
invest—there is every reason to believe that most
Americans would enthusiastically embrace the op-
portunity.
