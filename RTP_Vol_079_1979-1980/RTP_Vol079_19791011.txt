On Social Probation

The Interfraternity Council’s

Phi Kappa Psi was convicted
in court earlier this week and
fined $15 for breaking Lexing-

having an amplified sound per-

Canfield said that what he has

freshman should consider care-
fully when joining a fraternity.

He also said he warns fresh-
men about being too impressed
by upperclassmen in a fraterni-
ty.

“Half of them they’ll never
see again, except for parties,”
said Canfield of some upper-
classmen participating in rush.

“TI certainly would not lump
all fraternities together, there
are going to pe good ones and
bad ones when you have 17 or so
on campus,” said Canfield.

Canfield said he gives his
freshmen more counseling than
they get in other sports because
he is “interested in all aspects
of players’ lives.”’

“I don’t think all fraternities
are as interested in the fresh-
men as I am,” said Canfield.

Canfield pointed to Rob
Smitherman as a good example
of a fraternity member who
plays basketball; Smitherman
is a member of Sigma Phi Ep-
Silon. (See Smitherman’s Letter to
the Editor)

 

 
 
    

No More Money

by Joe Scott

After lengthy discussion, the
Executive Committee refused
to allocate additional money to
the Rugby Club, setting their
limit at $250 Monday night.

“We are struggling for our se-
cond generation,’ said Rugby
Club advisor and coach James
W. Worth, referring to the new
freshmen on the team. ‘‘Prices
keep going up all the time,” he
added. ‘Literally every cent we
get determines the future of the
team.”

“Tt’s a question of
economics,’’ said EC Senior
Representative Jay Blumberg.
“It is not a question of
legitimacy.’’ Other EC
members agreed saying that
the money situation this year
was the main factor in their
decision. A motion allocating
$250 from the Student Body
Reserve Fund passed 7-3.

Monthly reports by the Calyx,
Contact and Mock Convention
subcommittees outlined finan-
cial expenditures incurred.

Contact reported few new
transactions and stated their
balance at $1,228.14. Co-
Chairman Channing Hall, when
asked about the nature of the
balance, said he was unsure as
to its origin. The question arose
when EC Vice President Les
Cotter asked the exact amount
in the balance which should
have reverted back to the
Reserve Fund. A portion of the
amount was student body funds.

The Calyx reported expen-
ditures of $10,210 resulting from
three checks, one, a check for
$10,000, going to the Hunter
Publishing Company. Yearbook
collections to date total $6,079
with a current deficit of $4,201.

Calyx Business Manager
John Hamilton said this year’s
book would cost $17.14 per copy,
$6.70 of which comes from the
student tax. Self-generated
funds account for the rest.

Rugby Club Refused

Yearbook Editor John Cole
said only 683 underclassmen
pictures had been taken and
that a make-up day was being
discussed.

Rich Corrigan from the Mock
Convention reported a lone ex-
pense of $50 for copying costs.
He said that the major em-
phasis of their work was being
devoted to fund raising.

‘“‘We have no plans but are
open to suggestions,’’ said Cor-
rigan responding to questioning
concerning a Contact/Mock
Convention joint speaker. ‘‘In
general, we are not looking for
their help.”’

Concerning the Ring-tum
Phi’s attempt to cut costs, EC
President Steve Abraham said
that he talked to William -C.
Washburn, Executive Secre-
tary of Alumni Association,
about possible compensation
for newspaper issues sent to
alumni. Washburn said $250
would stretch his budget to the
limit and he foresaw no possi-
bility to pay more. Washburn
added he was sympathetic to
the paper’s needs.

Abraham noted that Wash-
burn had bought 300 extra
issues Homecoming weekend
for a total expense of $39.

Abraham opened discussion
on a student health box which
would be placed in the in-
firmary for student comments
on their treatment.

The EC unanimously recom-
mended that the suggestion be
given to the Student Health
Committee.

Tuesday’s EC meeting for-
mally approved the budget as
proposed. It was noted that this
year’s SBA amount was based
on a two percent attrition rate
and that last year’s budget did
not take that into account. Also
an attrition rate of three per-
cent was applied to the
undergraduate body.

 

Petitions for four freshmen
class positions and a First Year
Law EC Representative were
filed for the Oct. 15 elections.
Polls will be open from 9 a.m.
until 4 p.m. in the freshmen
dorm area and in Lewis Hall.

The President Speaks Out On Fraternities

University President Robert E.
R. Huntley was interviewed by
Ring-tum Phi News Editor David
Greer about his views on the
fraternity situation at Washinton
and Lee.

This is the first part of an exten-
sive interview. The second part
will appear next week in the Ring-
tum Phi.

Ring-tum Phi: What do you
see as the administration’s role
in fraternity management?

President Huntley: I would
prefer that the University’s role
be largely advisory. By the
“University’’ I would include
the administration and faculty.
That’s traditionally been the
case. I think we should stand
ready and offer and urge the
fraternities to utilize techniques
of management, property con-
trol, and other forms of controll-
ing activities in the fraternities,
by offering, as a backup, techni-
ques in which the university be
helpful.

My own hope would be that
the University does not find it
necessary to engage in an ac-
tive role in management. A
main advantage of the frater-
nities is that they provide
students an opportunity for self-
government, self-management,
self-discipline. That is what the
school stands for and that would
be my preference.

On the other hand, the
University does have an obliga-
tion to see to it that students
have an opportunity for an ef-
fective and helpful living and
social life on campus. Therefore
it is not impossible to imagine a
situation where, should frater-
nities fail to fulfill that function,
the University would have to
fact the question of whether it
should exert some _ stronger
measure of control. Obviously,
the difficulty with that is the
techniques—how does one go
about exerting stronger. control

over fraternities and more im-
portant than that, if you have to
do what in any great degree, it
would, to some extent, under-
mine one of the purposes of hav-
ing fraternities in the first
place?

RtP: Do you think the frater-
nities are governing themselves
in a proper manner now?

Huntley: I think there have
been many times in the recent
past when they have not. Last
year, I undertook to talk with as
many of the then and upcoming
fraternity leaders as I could
find. I hope to do that again this
year, with the view of trying to
implement the thoughts I’ve
just expressed: letting them
know the University’s interest
in how well they are managed,
giving them advice when they
want it about the needs they
might have, and generally urg-
ing them to exercise as high a
degree of responsibility as they
are capable of doing.

I don’t know whether the
period of somewhat sloppy
fraternity management as
characterized in some of the
fraternity houses has _ been
reversed or not.

RtP: In your speech to the
IFC last spring you expressed a
need for greater fraternity-
administration communication,
and asked for responses from
the fraternities. What was the
response? How many respond-
ed?

Huntley: All of the frater-
nities came by to see me follow-
ing that IFC meeting. The
response was generally very
favorable; favorable in terms
of the fraternities wishing to im-
prove both their image in this
community and the actual
operation of the houses. I was
encouraged by the response.
Whether there will be any
follow-through remains to be
seen.

Rtp: What is the faculty’s role
in fraternity management?

Huntley: The university’s by-
laws entrust to the faculty
ultimate authority over all mat-
ters involving student conduct
and student organizations with
the sole exception of the honor
system. That’s a somewhat
legalistic point of view, certain-
ly. Another way of looking at it
is: What role does the faculty
actually play in such gover-
nance? Again, I think the facul-
ty’s attitude over the past has
been that it is best if fraternity
activities are governed effec-
tively by student organizations.
I think that continues to be the
faculty’s hope—that the
organizations will want and be
able to govern the fraternities
effectively. But the faculty cer-
tainly has the power, if it choses
to exercise it, to order the ad-
ministration to take closer
supervision of fraternity life.
They have not really done so at
this point.

 

 

RtP: What do you see as the
purpose of fraternities at
Washington and Lee?

Huntley: They obviously
serve a social purpose. In a
small community like this, they
provide another dimension to
the social life of the students
and the living experiences that
are available to them. They pro-
vide an alternative that would
not otherwise exist on this cam-
pus.

Another thing to be noted
there is that whether or not one
had fraternities, it’s likely that
there would be, as I guess there
are, other groups within the stu-
dent body who would band
together for social activities
and for fellowship.

Fraternities, therefore, are
probably a natural outgrowth of
any group of people that is as
large even as our student body.
In that sense, you might think of
them as essentailly a necessary
growth of any student body.

Apart from that, fraternities

have served purposes beyond
merely providing young men
here with a level of fellowship
and friendship of a smaller
group than our student body
would represent. There have
been many occasions in the past
when fraternities have
stimulated the students who are
in them to achieve in a higher
level, both in curricular and
non-curricular matters, than
they otherwise would have
done. That’s what they ought to
be able todo.

It would be a sad thing if all of
one’s friends were simply folks
who were only interested in
drinking bouts on Saturday
night. That would be a sunder
substitute for friendship. If
fraternities are supposed to pro-
ffer the opportunity for close
friendships to the members, the
fraternities should render the
kind of friendship that has a
deeper dimension. And I think
often they have done that, and
sometimes they have not.

Society Returns —

by John Wells

The Washington and Lee Film
Society, again under the leader-
ship of faculty advisor Carren
Kaston, begins its second year
with a showing of Francois
Truffaut’s color film The Man
Who Loved Women on Friday
and Saturday.

The organization has ten-
tatively been granted $600 from
the Executive Committee. The
Society offers recent films free
of charge to campus and local
communities, and is especially
interested in obtaining films
available to patrons in larger
cities, but which don’t often

reach Lexington.

Following both of the 8 p.m.
showings of The Man Who Lov-
ed Women, a 1977 French com-
edy, there will be an open recep-
tion at the Washington and Lee
law school. At the reception, the
Society’s members will give in-
formation concerning this
year’s program and seek sug-
gestions for the series. They
will also be seeking student,
faculty, and community spon-
sorship to help pay for the films.

Also slated for the Fall Term
are French director Louis
Malle’s Kaspar Hauser (1975),
filmed by German director

Werner Herzog, on Dec. 7-8. All
movies will be shown in class-
room ‘‘C’’ of Lewis Hall.

Last year’s program included
Bergman’s Cries and Whispers,
Fassbinder’s Chinese Roulette,
Welles’ Falstaff, and a double
bill of Running Fence and
Memories of the Under-
developed.

Ms. Kaston is assisted by Jay
Diesing, president, and Mario
Pellicciaro, who is faculty co-
sponsor. She advises that any
comments or _ suggestions
should be directed to her at
W&L ext. 367, or Mr. Diesing at
463-2750, or to either of them at
the receptions.

(Mime )

The acclaimed Mime Theatre
of the Warsaw Chamber Opera
Company returns to Washing-
ton and Lee University’ this
Saturday evening (Oct. 13) for a
new series of pantomime pro-
ductions. Curtain time is 8 p.m.
for the show, which will take
place in the Troubadour
Theatre. There is no admission
charge. .

This marks the third visit by
the mimes to Washington and
Lee since their debut on the
campus in October 1976. Lee
Kahn, director of the University
Theatre, made the initial con-
tact with the group during a trip
to Poland — resulting in their
first American tour. The troupe
then returned to W&L early in
1977 as resident artists for
several weeks, under a visiting
scholars program established
by the late Arthur Graham
Glasgow in 1959 to promote the
creative arts at the university.

(Opera)

Leontyne Price, the world-
famous soprano of the
Metropolitan Opera, will be the
featured soloist with the New
York Philharmonic in its next
broadcast over WLUR-FM,
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s radio station, at 91.5 on the
dial. The performance is
scheduled for Sunday (Oct. 14)

 

at6p.m..

The broadcast will feature
Price in arias from a number of
famous operas, including Ver-
di’s “Il Trovatore,’’ Barber’s
“Antony and Cleopatra,’’ and
Puccini’s ‘‘Tosca.’’ In addition,
the orchestra — under the
direction of Zubin Mehta — will
play Mozart’s Symphony No. 40.

(Exhibition)

An exhibition exploring the
theories of color interaction as
espoused by artist Josef Albers
will be on view at Washington
and Lee University beginning
Monday (Oct. 8) and continuing
through Oct. 26. The exhibition
is sponsored jointly by the
Virginia Museum and W&L’s
Department of Fine Arts, and
may be seen in duPont Gallery
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on
weekdays.

In the end Keyton and Mur-

The film is full of truisms and

This Tuesday, the sixteenth,
in Reid 203 the Journalism De-

Buster Keaton’s classic 1927
film The General. It’s the story
of a southern railroad engineer
who loves both his southern
belle and his locomotive. In the

Evaluation

L by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

Once again the W&L football team lost. It was a
valiant effort—but unfortunately—in vain.

Despite losing their fourth game of the year, the
Generals did show signs of improvement. There were
even flashes of offensive punch.

The highlight of the afternoon for W&L was provid-
ed by none other than slotback Chris Leiser—who has
been the Generals’ major (only?) offensive weapon
this season. Leiser scored W&L’s first touchdown on
an 84-yard kick-off return. Two weeks ago against
Centre, Leiser won the game with a 93-yard kickoff
return. Against Fordham, the junior speedster caught
five passes for 144 yards and one TD, He also rushed
six times for 21 yards and returned two punts and four
kick-offs for a total of 103 yards. In all, Leiser ac-
counted for 268 yards—over 50 percent of the team’s
total for the afternoon.

However, Leiser had some help. W&L sophomore
quarterback Jim Wenke played his best game of the
season, completing 12 of 18 passes for 185 yards and
one TD. What’s amazing is that Wenke did not play
the entire game. He switched in and out with
freshman Chris Cavalline, depending on the situation.
Cavalline came in on running downs and Wenke came
in on passing situations. This same concept was used
a few years ago by Bear Bryant down at Alabama
with Jeff Rutledge and Richard Todd running the
wishbone.

Speaking of the wishbone, W&L tried using it
against Fordham—and that’s probably not a bad
idea. The Generals have had offensive problems this
year and a change to the wishbone could be just what
they need. With Stew Atkinson and Leiser at the
halfback positions, they would have enough speed to
go to the outside. The difficult tasks would be training
a quarterback to run the option with precision. But all
of W&L’s quarterbacks are underclassmen and there
is plenty of time for them to learn.

Despite W&L’s improved offense, offense alone
does not win football games. The defense—which has
played spectacularly all season long—once again
played well. Unfortunately, not well enough. Ford-
ham scored two touchdowns in the second quarter to
take a 14-0 halftime lead. Their first score was on a 64-
yard screen pass and their second on an eight-play 47-
yard drive with two minutes left in the half. Also, For-
dham rushed for 229 yards, including a 102-yard effort
by Steve Zirpoli.

 

 

 

 

Still, the Generals must be commended for their'ef-

fort. Down 14-0 at the half, they did not quit. Scoring
two touchdowns on their first two possessions of the
second half, the Generals battled back to cut Ford-
ham’s lead to 14-12. Leiser’s stunning run and a five-
yard dash by Atkinson kept them in the game, only to
fall behind again and eventually lose 27-15.

What seems to be the Generals’ problem is that they
cannot put 60 minutes of solid football together. When
the defense is playing well, the offense is making
mistakes. And when the offense is moving the ball,
the defense isn’t up to par.

True, as we said last week, the team is young and
still learning. They will make mistakes. But it is also
true that the team under coach Gary Fallon seems
more inspired than in past years. The team never
seems to quit and always seems to come back. We can
only wait and hope for the day when there will be no
need to come back—only to stay ahead.

Fordham Dumps W&L;
Record Falls To 1-4

by Dale Park
The W&L football team’s
record dropped to 1-4 last Satur-
day after losing a tough game to
the Fordham Rams, 27-15.
A Homecoming crowd of 4,751
watched the most impressive

offensive effort the Generals .

have shown this season.

“Early in the first half, the
defense did a good job of stop-
ping the Fordham offense,”’
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.
But with 3:53 left in the half,
Ram quarterback Vince Con-
nolly hit his wide receiver
Roger McGloin with a screen
pass that appeared to be going
nowhere. McGloin was able to
break free however, going 64
yards to score Fordham’s first
touchdown. ‘‘We had the screen
well contained but were unable
to bring McGloin down,”’ said
Fallon. The conversion was
good and Fordham led 7-0.

The Rams _ scored again
before the half ended. Ford-
ham’s quarterback Connolly
brought his team 50 yards in
seven plays before connecting
with Jim Pacheco from six
yards out. The conversion was
good and, with only :31 left in
the half, the Rams led 14-0.

In the first half W&L could
manage only 78 yards total of-
fense to Fordham’s 230 yards.
Yet the second half prove ‘to be
different.

Taking the ball on his own 16-

yard line, the Generals’ '
sophomore quarterback Jim
Wenke threw a screen pass to
junior slotback Chris Leiser.
This screen play also appeared
to be dead. Yet Leiser slipped
away from the Ram’s defense,
racing 84 yards for the score.

“‘Leiser made an outstanding
run on the play, the key to which
was some good down field
blocking,’ said Fallon. An
aborted point-after try turned
into an attempted two-point
conversion scramble which fail-
ed, and the score stood at 14-6
early in the third quarter.

Having stopped Fordham,
W&L took over on their own 6
yard line. Behind some deft
misdirection plays engineered
by Wenke, the Generals moved
the ball 94 yards, capped off by
senior tailback Stewart Atkin-
son’s five-yard touchdown run.
Yet the two-point conversion
again failed, and W&L trailed
14-12.

This was as close as the
Generals were to come. The
W&L defense has had a tenden-
cy this season to be scored on in
the closing minutes of a period
after playing solid defense
beforehand.

This became evident as the
Rams immediately countered
the Generals’ score, going 64
yards in nine plays. Fordham’s
Pacheco carried the ball the
final six yards for the

‘touchdown with only :12 left in

the third period.

In the fourth quarter,
freshman Bill Devine, Offen-
sive Player of the Game last
week against Macon, again hit
on a field goal attempt, this
time from 25 yards out as a
W&L drive stalled on the Rams
seven-yard line.

For the moment, the Ramzy
led 21-15. Controlling the ball for
5:34, Fordham marched steadi-
ly down to the W&L two-yard
line. Ram running back Craig
Miller plunger in for the score
with only :18 left in the game;
the point-after failed, for a final
score of 27-15.

The Generals gained 304
yards on the day, led by Wenke
who completed 12 of 18 passes
for 185 yards and a touchdown.

Again this week, the defense
was led by the play of defensive
end Tom Noble. Noble re-
covered a Fordham fumble ear-
ly in the game to go along with
his fine play in the previous
games.

Next week the Generals play
away against Hampden-
Sydney. Fallon described
Sydney as a ‘‘quick team that
plays together well on defense
and that throws a lot of different
alignments at its opponents.”’
Sydney finished second in the
ODAC last season and has 14 of

_ last year’s 22 starters _re-

turning.

Varsity Beats Alums 19-10

by Bill Whalen

The past and present of
Washington & Lee lacrosse met
last Sunday and for the first
time since 1975, the present
came out on top. Aided by seven
first quarter goals, the varsity
lacrosse team rolled to a 19-10
win over the lacrosse alumni.

The victory—the varsity’s se-
cond in the five year series—
was a_ hard-played, well-
enjoyed game for the players on
both sides. ‘“‘We had a lot of fun
and that’s what this game is
about,”’ said varsity coach Jack
Emmer.

The varsity opened the scor-
ing less than a minute into the
game and soon controlled the
contest for the rest of the after-
noon. Lightning-quick goals by
midfielders John Kemp and
Scott McLam and another by at-
tackman Mike Schuler posted
the varsity to an early 3-0 lead.

Another goal by midfielder
and co-captain John Hooper and
Kemp’s second tally of the
period increased the lead to 5-0.
The alumni were able to score
twice in the first quarter, but
goals by attackmen Pere
Roberts and Stu Rienhoff kept
the varsity five goals up.

Jim Lewis, who played on the
varsity team 21 years ago, was
replaced by Charlie Brown in
the alumni goal for the second
quarter. Brown fared better
than his teammate, allowing on-
ly three shots to get by him.

Attackman Jay Foster sand-
wiched two goals around
another goal by Roberts to give
the varsity an insurmountable

10-2 lead. Sam Englehart (class
of 73) later scored for the alum-
ni, cutting the margin to 10-3 at
halftime.

At this point, the game
became a chance for the varsity
to experiment with different

lines while the alumni could ~

showcase their talents.

The third quarter was
highlighted by the opposing
goalies. In goal for the varsity
was Bob Clements, All-
American goalie 1979. Tending
the nets for the alumni was Bill
Clements, All-American goalie
1950—Bob’s father.

The elder Clements was given
a rude welcome from varsity
middie George Santos. Santos
pumped in three goals within
three minutes to widen the gap
to 13-3.

Goals by Schuler, Foster and

middie Steve Herold further in-
creased the margin to 16-3. The
alumni were able to cut the lead
to 1646 before the end of the
third quarter, on goals by Jeff
Fritz, Brown (who was an All-

- American goalie in 1978) and

Charlie Stieff (class of ‘78).

The alumni outscored the var-
sity in the fourth quarter. Goals
by Roberts, Reinhoff and mid-
die Chris Cahill closed out the
varsity scoring attack.

Though the opposition was not
the same as a regular season
opponent, Emmer found much
to be pleased with. “We were
very competitive,” said “Em-
mer. “It’s obvious that we'll
have 32 solid players on our
roster when the season starts.”

The varsity will be stacked
with plenty of. midfielders.

Water Polo 8-0

by Dave Johnson

The W&L water polo team
continued its winning ways last
weekend with five victories
over conference competition to
boost their season record to 8-0.

The wins came in the first
half of the Southern Water Polo
League Tournament held at the
University of Richmond. The
second half of the tournament
will be played at W&L October
19-20 when the Generals will
meet defending champs, Rich-
mond, for the first time this
season.

In their first game of the tour-
nament, the Generals faced
East Carolina University, one
of the teams Coach Page
Remillard had tagged as this
season’s ‘‘tough competition.”
W&L won the contest 14-10.

The following game _ was
something of a breather for the
W&L squad as they defeated
Lynchburg handily, 21-3, to
complete Friday evening’s
games.

Saturday morning, the
Generals began by knocking off
Georgia Southern, 9-6, and then
doing away with George
Washington University by a 9-5
score.

The W&L team rounded out
the weekend with an easy win
over James Madison. The final
score of that game was W&L 15,
JMU5.

Despite the apparent success
of the water polo team in the
tournament, Remillard was not
pleased with his team’s per-
formance. ‘‘I was disappointed
in our lack of execution, lack of
aggressiveness, and our lack of
ability to put teams away. We
need to develop a killer in-
stinct,’’ said the coach.

Remillard feels that to con-
tinue winning, his team must be
able to handle the ball better
and react better to game situa-
tions. The team must improve
in these areas if they are to
have a shot at the Southern
League championship.

Individual standouts of the
tournament were Biff Martin—
who led W&L with 19 goals—and
Drew Pillsbury, whose constant
movement made him a
dangerous offensive threat,
while his tough defense was
responsible for several steals
and turnovers.

This weekend, the water polo
Generals will have another op-
portunity to test their skills at
the Brown University Invita-

tional in Providence, RI. W&L
will be competing against
Brown, Chicago Loyola, and
MIT. The first two of these
teams are among the top 10 in
the nation and are serious con-
tenders for the national cham-
pionships.

In Remillard’s words, the
Generals will be playing ‘‘out of
our class,’’ but he still has hopes
of a good showing. In practice
this week, the team is concen-
trating on game situations ‘‘in
an attempt to reinstitute the ag-
gressive style of play which was
lacking this past weekend,”’
said Remillard.

If this aggressiveness can be
regained and combined with a
disciplined offense, W&L should
perform well this weekend.
Remillard feels that, consider-
ing the quality of the competi-
tion, one win would be ‘‘ex-
cellent,” and two wins would
prove that the Generals are
ready to take on arch-rival
Richmond. “If we win three,”
said Remillard, “they better
batten down the hatches and put
out small-craft warnings,
because. we have arrived.”
That, however, is a very big
sof”.

Booted, Booted... Tied

by Chris Sisto

The varsity soccer team fell
upon hard times last week as
they dropped two games and
saw their record drop to 2-4. The
Generals lost a close 2-1 game
last Wednesday to Davidson
College and a 5-0 Homecoming
defeat to Averett College last
Sunday.

Against Davidson, the
Generals could not hold on to an
early 1-0 lead. The goal came in
the first half on a shot by Bill
Brown. Davidson came back
with two goals, one in each half,
to finish off the Generals.

Coach Rolf Piranian was not
totally displeased with his
team’s play, however, ‘‘We
were very competitive with a
team of Davidson’s caliber.’’
Davidson is a Division I team.

Talking about Sunday's loss,
Piranian expressed more disap-
pointment. ‘‘The loss to Averett
was a combination of them hav-

‘ing a few superior players (four
from Finland) and our not ex-
ecuting very well,” said Pira-
nian.

The offense could not pose
any strong scoring threats and
did not get on track all day. The
-Generals had only nine shots on
goal, compared to Averett’s 19.
Piranian went through three
goalies but still could not stop
the blowout.

The Washington & Lee soccer
team travelled to Radford Col-
lege and battled to a scoreless
tie in a game played Tuesday
afternoon.

The Generals were led by a
stingy defense and freshman
goalie, Rudy Halcomb, who
turned in the shutout. Halcomb
has apparently replaced Kevin
Carney as the Generals’
number-one goaltender. When
asked if Halcomb would con-
tinue to start in the W&L goal,
Coach Rolf Piranian said, ‘He

Ht

played well against Radford
and we have to judge by per-
formance.”’

Piranian said that his game-
plan called for a “‘rope-a-dope”’
tactic of laying back on defense
and waiting for just the right

moment to explode offensively.

Piranian was apparently
pleased with his team’s defer.
sive effort after being blown out

5-0 by Averett on Sunday. This

strong defensive effort

precedes a three-game homes-
tand in which the Generals will
face Navy, Mary Washington
' and Roanoke.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr:

Pass-Fail

The Pass-Fail grading system at Washington and
Lee is a productive and viable option. It encourages
students to choose a course or examine an academic
discipline that might not otherwise be considered if a
grade were involved. Pass-fail may be one of the few
incentives left for an increasingly vocation-minded
student body to experience a true liberal arts educa-
tion.

But we feel that pass-fail should be a private alter-
native. There is simply no reason for a professor to
know which of his students have elected to take his
course on a pass-fail basis. We are not calling into
question the objectivity of W&L’s professors. We
merely feel that it would be an improvement for pass-
fail to be a matter only between the registrar and the
student—as it is at many other academic institutions
across the country.

Wilson Bridge Rip-Off

Were you one of the lucky few who made it to the
football game without losing your life’s savings? I
tried to make it across Wilson Bridge without spend-
ing a cent, but I couldn’t. Coming down the steps from
the gym parking lot, I was confronted by several
husky lacrosse players—each trying to unload their
ballcaps at $5 a piece. How could I say no—especially
when it’s a 30-foot drop off the bridge.

And speaking of your ‘‘Catch-22” situations, there
were all those high schools girls selling programs at a
dollar each. If I had played my cards right, I could
have escaped only $1 poorer. But since I had just
spent five bucks, it was obvious that I could afford a
measly program. So how could I say no?

By this time I thought I was home free. But nooo....
I ran into the basketball team and one of their raffles.
I ended up spending several dollars. Even though
each ticket was $1, I had to buy several to stand a
chance of winning. Once again, how could I say no? I
couldn’t pretend to be a cheapskate—especially with
a program in my hand anda balleap on my head.

Now I had only 20 yards to go, but not without
dishing out more money. First, some frat-rat was
hawking these silly posters of some fool who is sup-
posed to be a “‘preppie.” I personally find these
humorless because I have to see 1,000 guys just like
him on the Colonnade every morning.

Only 10 yards from the stadium, I had to buy
several grain cups. I think I finally made it to my seat
by the second-half kickoff.

I wish I could have bought a hot dog and a coke, but
I was wiped out after crossing the bridge.

I live in a stacked deck.

Persiflage

An Outlet For Aggression

There are few more exciting activities on
campus than I.M. football.

Although most people might not understand
the exultation one-can feel in accumulating
bruises, ‘‘tough”’ football is more than just a
masochist’s utopia. It provides an outlet for
aggression and enables we Walter Mittys of
ex-high school jockdom to really believe that
NFL films should send a camera crew up to
the practice fields.

First comes the pre-game ritual. You must
prepare to willingly slam your body into other
human beings, at full speed, without the
benefit of pads.

Unless you are some kind of simian psycho-
path this process calls for some very serious
mind alteration. I personally find that
Budweiser and Ted Nugent do the trick.

Letter To Editor

Then there is the actual playing of the
game. Here is your chance to show that pro-
fessor how you feel about that little paper he
assigned you over Homecoming, to let that
girl know how foolish she was in preferring
The Last Convertible to your company, or just
to prove to yourself that a 1.9 grade-point
average is not the sum worth of your college
experience.

It really doesn’t matter if you play well, or
if you win or lose. A few beers and a fertile
imagination can always correct any deficien-
cies.

What is important is that you’ve been able
to clear out all those nasty, evil feelings
without going to jail, or please note, breaking
the Honor Code.

No Basketball Blacklist

Dear Editor,

I was shocked to read of the
accusation a certain fraternity
president made against Coach

sons for

Canfield in last week’s Ring- one.
For a decade there have
always been basketball players

‘tum Phi: “Canfield doesn’t
want basketball players to
pledge fraternities, and has
threatened to blacklist those
who do,’’ said this uninformed
person.

This statement could not be
further from the truth.

This is my third year in the
basketball program.

As a freshman I pledged and
subsequently joined a fraterni-
ty. At no time was I told not to
join a frat or threatened to be
“‘blacklisted’”” by Coach Can-
field.

I have obviously not been
‘“‘blacklisted,’’ for I have
started for the team much of
my first two seasons.

Coach Canfield does suggest
that the freshman prospects
‘‘look over the situation’”’ during
rush, not get caught up in rush
and join the first house they see.

The IFC seems to agree with
this philosophy, having imposed
the rule of pledging until after
the fourth rush date. Coach
Canfield is just trying to help
the freshman clear up some of
the chaos of rush.

While I understand the IFC’s
opposition to donating kegs for
a fundraising concert, I see cost

and precedent as the major rea-
opposition.
‘‘blacklisting’’ as a reason is not
just a poor excuse, it is a wrong

(Outdoors:
Fall Colors

by Jim Feinman

The Blue Ridge Mountains
will be ablaze with color this
week as the peak of the fall col-
oration approaches. Area out-
doorsmen will be able to enjoy
hiking, camping, fishing and
hunting amidst the brilliant red
and yellow of autumn.

Blue Ridge Parkway rangers
predict that the color peak will
occur around October 16 if
seasonal winds and rain co-
operate. Rangers report that
the above average rainfall this
year has brought out thicker
foliage than usual and, combin-
ed with the recent cool weather,
should provide a spectacular
season for fall color.

The Blue Ridge Parkway will
be a good choice for students
who wish to spend an afternoon
driving through the mountains
to enjoy the scenery. The park-
way is easily accessible by
following. Route 60 east from
Lexington. It is recommended
that students attempt to visit
the parkway during the week if
possible as it is a popular—and
crowded—spot on weekends.

Students interested in hiking
and camping will find the Ap-
palachian Trail a good choice
this weekend and next. The trail
can be reached from the Route
60-Blue Ridge Parkway in-
tersection and where Route 501
crosses the James River. Both
of these segments of the trail
are interesting and clearly
marked.

If the recent (two days!) dry
spell will hold up the streams
and rivers should recede to pro-
vide some good fall fishing.
Bass will be hitting on small
streams and on the Maury and
James Rivers. Look for a few
large (10-20 lbs.) muskies to be
taken from the James in the
vicinity of Buchanan.

Squirrel season is open in
Rockbridge until October 13.

There were 18 middies on last
Sunday's roster and Emmer
mentioned that there are 15
more in the freshmen class.

In Sunday's contest, the mid-
dies provided i1 of the
Generals’ 19 scores. Santos led
the seven scoring midfielders
with a hat-trick. On the day, 10
different players scored for the
varsity.

The goalie position also look-
ed strong. Sophomore Ware
Palmer started the game and
allowed only three goals in the
first half. Clements played the
second half and despite allow-
ing seven goals, made several
sharp passes downfield to
breaking middies.

Notices

Clubs and Organizations

Please check one of the following; you are:
A) Anti-nuke

B) Illiterate

C) Impotent

D) Stoned

If you picked A), then you should definitely
read on. If you picked B), C), or D), then
you're obviously a typical Washington and
Lee student. If you picked none of the above,
then read on anyway. This is to announce, as
you may have guessed by now, STAND, or
Students Totally Against Nuclear Develop-
ment.

The name is interchangable, but the pur-
pose behind the formation of W&L’s first Anti-
Nuclear group is clear: Phase ’em out, shut
’em down, and let’s get on with the solar age.

Many universities have active student
groups who have investigated the issues, the
alternatives, and the consequences of nuclear
energy, and have decided to work against the
further development of nukes.

Student groups and the grass roots com-
munity movement have proven that united
citizen action can make a difference.

Our group will focus on projects such as let-
ter campaigns, learning the art of non-violent
civil disobedience, participating in local

 

rallies, raising funds for national and local
lobbying efforts, and most importantly edu-
cating ourselves about the real potentials of
solar energy and conservation, and the
economic international, and medical pitfalls
(to put it lightly) associated with our present
proposed reliance upon nuclear energy.

Our first meeting will be held Monday at 8
p.m. in room 203 of Reid Hall.

An eight minute film made by two W&L stu-
dents who went to the recent anti-nuke rally
sponsored by the Musicians Union for Safe
Energy in New York City will be shown to
help launch the group with purpose. And
remember what Captain Radiation says:

“Better active today than radioactive
tomorrow!”’

From

College?

Adventure?

Add It To Your Schedule.

Try rappelling... descending
a precipice by arope and the
seat of your pants. The fast-
est way down. Except for free
fall. :

Rappelling is one part of a
challenging academic and
extracurricular program of-
fered by Army ROTC.

Army ROTC teaches pro-
fessionally oriented students
to lead people and to direct
equipment to achieve speci-
fic objectives as an Active
or Reserve Officer.

If you’re looking for the
challenge of leadership, in
college and afterwards, look
into Army ROTC.
