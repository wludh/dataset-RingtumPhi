Student Acquitted In
Open ilondé Trial

On the Monday of exam week
a student was found innocent of
an honor violation in a public
trial in Lee Chapel. The vote
was unanimous.

The student was charged with
lying to an Executive Commit-
tee investigative team.

The team was investigating
the theft of a case of Coors beer
from the freshman dormitories.

During the course of the in-
vestigation the team interview-
ed several witnesses who
testified that they saw the beer
in a room in the Graham-Lees
dormitories during the early
hours of March 15, after the
Nighthawks concert in the
Cockpit.

The accused student stated-

that he did not see any Coors
beer and that he spent the night
in the room.

He said that he had been
drinking heavily and that he
passed out on a mattress while
others in the room continued to
party.

A member or members of the
investigative team turned the
accused in for lying.

Student Hit Again

The accused student received
a closed Honor hearing on the
night of April 2.

Two members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee disqualified
themselves from hearing the
case because they were impor-
tant witnesses.

The accused was found guilty
in the closed trial; giving him
the option of withdrawing from
the university of taking the case
public.

The public trial in Lee Chapel
was attended by a large crowd
of students and faculty, despite
winter semester exams.

The Executive Committee
prosecution was handled by
Bruce Poole, Junior Represen-
tative, and John Fraser, Senior
Law Representative.

The accussed was defended
by Tom Schetelich and Jack
Carrado.

The trial was mediated by
Bill Garrett, the head of the Stu-
dent Bar Association.

Many witnesses testified in
the eleven-hour trial.

At times the testimony of the
EC investigative team centered
around a key witness in the

- Case.

Two of the team members
testified that the team did not
question this key witness in
their preliminary investigation.
One member of the team
testified that the team did inter-
view this witness.

Contradiction in the
testimony of the individuals
present in the dormitory room
were evident in details such as
how much Coors beer was in the
room and the beer’s location.

Most of the witnesses testified
that the accussed was lying on a
mattress on the floor during the

$4,100 In Possessions Stolen During The Year

by Joe Scott

“One of the main reasons I
came to Washington and Lee
was for the honor code. Now I
know the honor code is a joke. I
think it is a facade that should
be torn down to reveal the reali-
ty of our campus.”

Over the past two years,
junior Andy Pick has had more
than $4,100 in possessions
stolen. The most recent theft in-
volved a $1,400 stereo taken
sometime over spring vacation.

The list of missing items is
long and varied. Cash, clothes,
a tape deck, a C. B. radio, 40
record albums and a shotgun
are only several examples.

The list does not include his
car, stolen in October, or a
down jacket, recovered with the
car. Several juveniles were
later charged and pleaded guil-
ty to the offense.

“‘T come from a small town in
Alabama where you can leave
your keys in your car overnight

and nothing would happen and
now I’ve come come to the
sophisticated gentlemen’s
school in Virginia to learn about

dishonesty and thievery as a

way of life.”’

The thieves broke in to Pick’s
house, 820 McCorkle Dr.,
through the back door during
break. ‘‘They didn’t bother my
roommates’s things, they went
directly to my room,’ said
Pick. “‘I have an idea who did it

because they broke into my
room earlier this year. These
thieves know my room so well
you'd think they’d lived there
before,’’ he said. ‘‘To all poten-
tial thieves — I have nothing
left.”

Pick believes his stereo is not
on Campus or in town, ‘‘some-
one would see it. I think they
have good friends at other cam-
puses to fence it.’’ He. also

So far, 30 Washington and Lee

$800 for the National Multiple

Mass Media and Politics Topic of Speech

James David Barber, pro-
fessor of political science at
Duke University and author of
the soon-to-be-published book
“The Pulse of Politics: The
Rhythm of Presidential Politics
in the 20th Century,’’ will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Thursday, May 1, on his
view of the role of the mass
media as the decisive influence
in ‘today’s presidential elec-
tions.

Scheduled for 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel, Barber’s address is
open to the public at no charge.

Barber’s often startling grasp
of the American political scene
began to surface prominently in
1969 — then, in a paper on
Richard Nixon, he predicted the
tragedy to come in _ that
presidency. Three years later,
he challenged many long-held

But no words are so ‘‘stunn-
ing,”’ according to Time maga-
zine in a feature last month, as
the opening sentences of his

new book on media control of
Dolitics: ‘‘A revolution in
presidential politics is under-
way. No longer do the Demo-
cratic and Republican parties
control the choice of standard-

- bedrers. In their place a new set

of king-makers has arisen: the
journalists. For it is in the
newspapers, the magazines and
on television screens that the
presidential candidacies are
created and destroyed.”’.

Barber continues: ‘‘What is
new is not mass communication
as one of the major forces in
politics, but rather its
emergence to fill virtually the
whole gap in the electoral pro-
cess left by the default of other
independent elites who used to
help manage the choice....

presidential candidate faces to-
day is not building a coalition of

moving to the University of
Chicago, where he received

both his B.A. and master’s .

degrees. He received his Ph.D.
in political science from Yale in
1960.

From 1960 to 1972, he held a
variety of positions in Yale’s
political science division — as
professor, director of graduate
studies in politics, and associate
director of the department’s
research library. In 1972 he
moved to Duke, where for the
past eight years he has been
department head and James B.
Duke Professor of Political
Science. An energetic critic of
several White House admini-
strations, Barber has written
articles and interpretive pieces
for such periodicals as World
Magazine (‘‘The Presidency
After Watergate’’), the New
York Times (“Ford as the
President: Some Hard Ques-
tions’), and the Washington
Post (‘‘Predictions on Jimmy

Evans Wins
Grant

John M. Evans, professor of
English at Washington and Lee
University, has been awarded a
research grant from. the
Maurice L. Mednick Memorial
Fund, administered by the
Virginia Foundation for In-
dependent Colleges.

Evans, who teaches courses
on Augustan and later 18th-
century English literature, will
use the grant this summer for
study of the works of John
Milton and Alexander Pope at
Yale University and at the
Library of Congress. He will
also be on a sabbatical leave-of-
absence during W&L’s winter:
term in 1981 to continue the pro-
jects.

The Mednick Memorial was

and whose family and business
associates wished to perpetuate
his name by establishing a
scholarship fund to emphasize
his interest in higher education.

EC Addresses Security;
Makes Recommendations

After hearing the details of a
rash of burglaries that occurred
in the freshman dorms over spr-
ing break, the Executive Com-
mittee passed two recommen-
dations Monday night aimed at
W&L's “‘security problem”.

In its first recommendation
the EC requested Steve
Abraham, the EC President, to
talk with President Huntley
about strenghthening the
security force at W&L.

The second recommendation
asks the Administration to have
all the dorm room locks chang-
ed.

It also asks the University not
to give the janitors pass keys
for the new locks.

The role that pass keys
played in the thefts and the

strength of the EC's action were-

the focal points of discussion.

First-year Law _ Represen-
tative Sam Allen spoke in favor
of stronger action thatn the EC
eventually took.

“We've (the EC) talked about
security all year long, and what
do we have?...a couple of
lights,’ said Allen, in answer to
his own question.

Allen told the EC that it hada
chance to take strong action ina
concrete way.

After Allen's motion, failed,
one favoring pass keys to held
only by the head dorm
counselor, he supported another
by Freshman Representative
Edmund Schenecker.

Schenecker proposed _ that
dorm counselors be punished
for losing pass keys and no
janitors have pass keys.

When that motion stalled 6-6
Allen said, “It is obvious the
Executive Committee does not
want to take strong action on
this matter.”

Allen called the eventual mo-
tion a ‘wave in the wind.”

passed.

After Abraham's proposal to
change the locks in the dorms
and keep janitors from having
pass keys, one EC member
referred to him as ‘‘the great
compromiser”’ Henry Clay.

And the EC discussed _ pro-
blems which have arisen over
the free courses it organized for
the spring.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole said the auto mechanics
course will probably be can-
celled because of the death of
the mechanic who was to teach
the course.

The wine-tasting course caus-
ed considerable debate and
theree votes before it was
straightened out.

First-year Law  Represen-
tative Sam Allen said he
thought the wine could be pur-
chased wholesale.

But several EC members op-
posed the idea of the EC spon-
soring a course that only
Students over 21-years-of-age
can take.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg proposed a motion,
which passed unanimously, that
the EC should not pay for any of
the courses.

“These costs are minimum,
so people should pay for them,”
Blumberg said.

Allen offered to look into the
cost of the wine, and Cotter put
his offer into a motion which
failed 66.

After Cotter’s motion to have
the matter investigated failed,
Abraham proposed the course
should be dropped.

That motion also failed and
Cotter’s original motion was
brought up again and passed.

Earlier in the meeting, Cotter
brought up a project he has
been looking into with Athletic
Director William McHenry and

The project is the construc-
tion of a jogging and walking
path along the C&O Canal-
Maury River trail.

The organizers of the project
want W&L students to raise
$7,500 by June 30, 1980.

After talking about the pro-
ject, the large amount of money
and short period of time in
which to raise it, the EC recom-
mended Cotter look into the
matter.

The EC will also begin mak-
ing White Book revisions Mon-
day night.

At the same meeting, the EC
will accept petitions for persons
who want to run for the Univer-
sity Council,

The UC is composed of Ad-
ministration members, faculty
members and students.

The EC had planned to talk to
the SAB Co-Chairmen about
ticket scalping at the
Nighthawks concert.

But the co-chairmen did not
attend the meeting and the EC
said it will request their atten-
dance at the next meeting.

Allen also asked Danny
Raskin, the sole SAB represen-
tative, why movies are no
longer shown at the law school.

Raskin said he will look into
the matter.

stereo equipment.

Neither the Lexington Police
nor the University have any
clues thus far in the investiga-
tion.

There were five rooms involv-
ed in Graham-Lees and all were
entered with a pass key, accord-
ing to University proctor Bob
Murray. Those who suffered
losses include John Billmyre,
whose $370 Bose speakers were
stolen; Ken Johnstone, who is
missing a $300 Onkyo amplifier;
Doug Woodson, a $550 tape
deck; Townsend Oast, who
reports missing a pair of meter
indicators valued at about $40;
and Craig Albanese, who lost a
tape deck.

The hinges were taken off of
the door of Johnstone's closet
and the amplifier was removed
from under several other pieces
of stereo equipment.

None of the other equipment
was touched, and the boxes
were left in order. The other
victims’ equipment was taken
directly out of their rooms.

The apartment break-ins in-
cluded the removal of a set of
headphones and a tape deck
from the apartment of Andy
Pick, 820 McCorkle Drive.

The items had a combined
value of $1400, according to
police reports.

The other break-in was at the
home of Michael Sokolowski of
116 Lee Avenue. He reported
missing an estimated $165
worth of articles including
music books, a brief case and
jumper cables.

Movie Review

“The Changeling’ Creaks

By John Wells

The Changeling, which opens
this Friday at the State
Theater, is a well acted
although not particularly in-
novative variation of the old
haunted house thriller.

The director, Hungarian-born
Peter Medak, displays a skillful
sense of timing, and his execu-
tion of an adequate screenplay
is immeasureably aided by the
fine acting of George C. Scott,
his wife and frequent co-star
Trish Van Devere, and veteran
star Melvyn Douglas
who most recently won the
Academy Award for best sup-

porting actor.
The story opens as Scott’s
wife (Jean Marsh) and

daughter are killed, even before
the principal credits are shown
(a la Hope Lange and child in
Death Wish). Scott, as a
celebrated composer, moves
out of his apartment and buries
his grief by accepting an offer
to lecture at a_ university
somewhere in Washington
state. There he decides to rent
an older home from the local
historical society, whose
representative (Van Devere)
takes him and the audience on a
tour of The House.

Scott’s prospective dwelling
seems benignly sinister at first,
but he brightens the place up a
bit with tapestries and Chagall
prints, and sets up a music

illusion of tranquility is dissolv-
ed when the actor leaves the
room and a single piano key is
sharply pressed by an unknown
force. This is followed by bang-
ing noises (couldn’t be the
pipes) and then a succession of
several cliche-ridden haunted
house occurrences: Doors that
open and creak by themselves,
mysteriously turned-on water
faucets, an ominously tinkling
chandelier, and eventually the
discovery of a cobweb-cloaked
secret room, containing a small
wheel chair and a music box
(which happens to play a tune
Scott himself had composed).
Here’s where the plot begins
to unfold as Scott consults Van
Devere, with whom he’s
become friendly, and .the
historical society for informa-
tion about the house’s past. A

tight-lipped old crone named |

Minnie Huxley warns him that
the house is ‘‘not fit for people”’
but refuses to exvlain why. A
seance is then held, providing
one of the film's better directed
scenes and showing admirable
control by not resorting to gore
tactics.

After the spirit of a crippled
child is contacted, Scott persists
in digging up the whole story
even at the risk of locking horns
with a powerful Senator
(Douglas, trim and spry at 79)
who once lived in the house and
is mysteriously associated with
a darker aspect of its history. It

in the process.

George C, Scott handles his
role well, and actually develops
a sort of fascinating rapport
with the real star, the House,
which rumbles and quakes as
he confronts it with hoarsely
shouted questions, Van Devere,
a fine actress who really
deserves better, finally breaks
with the laid-back coolness she
maintains throughout the first
half of the picture and sweats,
shouts, and darts her eyes
around just like George. Many
of the scenes appear to be
humorous in content, and are in
that respect honest for surely
performers of such calibre
regarded many of the lines they
were required to speak as
satirical. In the film’s funniest
sequence Van Devere is chased
throughout the house by the
decrepit but belligerent old
wheelchair, which bears down
on her with such speed and
ferocity as to induce involun-
tary mirth. The film’s final
moments are entirely with the
realm of prediction.

Music Review

Popular

By Mark Kinniburgh

Elvis Costello has finally taken the number one
position on the album charts with his latest release
Get Happy. Anyone who has followed Costello
through his first three albums will assert that it is
about time that the recognition came, and
although Get Happy may not be Elvis’ best try to
date, it is certainly a commercial success. The
Costello phenominon is a strange one at best,
because it seems that you can love him or hate
him — I haven't heard anyone say anything in bet-
ween. As a songwriter, Elvis Costello can’t be
compared, for he far outdistances all rivals. But
as a performer and a musician, Costello manages
to alenate some listeners while enchanting others.

On his first album, My Aim Is True, Costello
writes such songs as ‘“‘Alison,’’ (to be recorded
later by Linda Rondstadt), ‘‘Watching The Detec-
tives,” (performed on Live At Hollywood High) and
‘‘Miracle Man,”’ (later recorded by the Outlaws).
The first album is unique because it was recorded
in three days in a basement studio with minimal
production and tampering. The quality of the
record is therefore quite raw with a great deal of
spontaneous energy.

The second album, This Year's Model, ranks as
the most straight-forward rock album that
Costello has done to date. As if to prove that the
first try was no fluke, Elvis hits hard with ‘Radio,
Radio,”’ ‘Lip Service,’ ‘‘No Action” and ‘“‘Pump
It Up,” each of which has a distinctive rocking
quality and definite Costello tag. On This Year's
Model we see the introduction of the Attraetions,
Costello's back-up band made up of seasoned bar

Acceptance For Elvis

musicians who still accompany him.

Armed Forces, as Costello’s third album, stands
out as a blatant political statement with songs
such as ‘‘Oliver’s Army” and “Green Shirt” and
“Goon Squad.” There are more orchestrated
songs on ‘Armed Forces,’’ a far cry from the
simplicity of the first album. This third album
reflects the Costello philosophy of not repeating on
one album what he has done or said on a previous
one.

Finally to Get Happy, we see Costello’s bid for
commercial acceptability with an album of twenty
songs. Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk and The Clash’s
London Calling each are dual album sets and yet
they lack the number of songs on the one disc
Costello album. There is also a plus to Get Happy in
that there is very little ‘‘filler’’ material. Most of
the songs are good enough to carry an entire
album, which is the trend these days. So, even if
you never cared for Elvis Costello, you might want
to buy or borrow Get Happy and give it a few listen-
ings, and be advised, it could grow on you,

The News In Brief

 

The Economics Of
. Coal Costs

Interesting fact: it is cheaper
to ship coal from South Africa to
Corpus Christi, Texas, than
from Colorado to Texas.

“It is ridiculous that you can
bring in coal 7,000 miles from
Africa for less than from Col-
orado,’’ James Burkhardt, an
official of Central Light &
Power Company told the
Baltimore Sun.

Other United States seaport
cities are also considering ship-
ping in coal from Australia. “It
is amazing that you can ship
coal halfway around the world
for less than bringing it in from
a state north of us,”’ said the
mayor of San Antonio.

It is a special irony that the

U.S., with the world’s largest
coal reserves, enough to last
hundreds of years, imported 3
million tons of coal last year—
almost twice the level of two
years ago. (770 million tons of
coal were produced domestical-
ly last year.)

Railroad industry officials
maintain that without even
higher rates for hauling coal the
railroads will continue to fall in-
to financial troubles. (Rails now
haul three-fourths of the na-
tion’s coal. )

While coal costs have remain-
ed relatively stable at about
$7.20 a ton, it costs an additional
$19.25 a ton to haul it by rail
from the Wyoming mines to to
south Texas cities.

Is This Any Way To Run A

Student Government ?

This is the story of two very
crazy college students who have
gotten hold of the student
government.

They are Jim Mallon and
Leon Varjian, president and
vice-president of the Wisconsin

_ Student Association.

Their first act in office was to
change the name of the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin to the Univer-
sity of New Jersey. ‘‘Do you
know that every other state of
the union has a ‘University of ’
except New Jersey?” exclaim-
ed Leon Varjian, pounding the
desk for emphasis. “So we
figured, what the hell, we can
afford to be big about it. There
are 13 Universities of Wiscon-
sin, right?”’

At an early political rally,
their supporters The Pail and
Shovel Party — were mudsl-
inging and backstabbing life-
size cardboard pictures of their
opponents with rubber knives
and real mud. (They publicly
pledged a campaign of “‘graft,
money-laundering schemes,
bribes, and other forms of cor-
ruption”; they also “bought
off’’ voters with $35 million in
play money.)

Their platform was sum-
marized by the slogan. ‘‘Give
students what they want: sex,
drugs, and rock and roll — the
Big Three.”’ They promised to
buy the Statue of Liberty and
move it to Wisconsin, provide
escalators on steep hills, give
trading stamps with bookstore
purchases, provide helicopter
service to the dorms, and flood
the football stadium for mock
naval battles.

Last September they spent
about $2,500 in student money
buying hundreds of plastic pink
flamingos, which they set up on

the lawn in front of the main ad-
ministration building to

welcome new students.

The pair has also declared
war against UCLA, Berkeley
and about 50 other college cam-
puses.

The secret to political suc-
cess, according to Jim Mallon is
to ‘‘buy off the opposition, pay
off the press, and give the peo-
ple what they want.”’ He gave a
reporter for the Washington
Post a check for $15 trillion to
write a good story about them.

But not everyone is happy
with this unique form of student
government’ The student
newspaper, the Daily Cardinal,
charged that Mallon and Var-
jian had paid four friends $3 an
hour to pass out penny tuition
rebates during registration
week; made more than $100 in
personal long-distance phone
calls charged to the student
government; bought $600 worth
of toys for their office; and
spent $125 on a_ telephone
answering machine for their
“Dial a Joke”’ service.

The graft is not hidden,
Mallon’s sister is student
association secretary, his
girlfriend is its official
photographer, and his room-
mate is his executive assistant
and field marshal of his army of
draft beer drinkers.

Other student leaders have
complained that Mallon and

Varjian are hurting the reputa-
tions of student government all
over the country.

They have had their budget
frozen and audited by the
dean’s office. ‘“‘We found no
evidence of _ illegalities of
misuse of funds,’’ says the dean
of students. ‘‘We did find a lot of
evidence that (some) people
wished they’d spent their
money differently.”

But apparently, the students
like them because they were re-
elected for a second term.

Answering the charges of
misappropriation of student
funds, Varjian told the Chroni-
cle of Higher Education: ‘‘Sure
we are squandering funds. Ab-
solutely true! We squander
them on beer. We squander
them on parties. We squander
them on drugs. We squander
them on all sorts of things.’

“Of course there are il-
legalities every day,’’ he con-
tinued, pounding the table for
emphasis. “The bribes, the
graft, the payoffs, the under-
the-table deals; the money in
the back pocket...”

And although he _ has
graduated, Malion is thinking
about running for a third term.
“It’s the greatest job in the
world,” he said. ‘I’ve got four
electric typewriters and my
phone has six buttons on it.”’

Casper, Wyo, was jilted by his
girlfriend recently, So, he put
up a sign in front of his house:
“For Sale, Used Boyfriend.
Good Condition. 266-4382.”’

Weckwerth has gotten a good
response to his plea and hopes
to find someone nice out of all
who have responded.

Silver Honesty

New York’s Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel has had a windfall of
honesty lately. Three months
ago, when the price of silver
was at an all-time high, a New
Jersey woman sent six silver
demitasse spoons back that she
had taken years before as
souvenirs.

Since then, 33 stolen silver
spoons have been returned to
the hotel, along with two silver
candlesticks, a silver cham-
pagne bucket, and a silver
oyster fork.

W&L Defamed

From Dr. John D. Battle, Jr.,
class of °34, comes an_ in-
teresting item from. the
Cleveland Amory. The book
seems to discuss the drop in
SAT scores and the general in-
eptitude of today’s college
students, using us aS an exam-
ple:

“The chaplain of Washington
& Lee University had told
him...that the students there
didn’t know how to do anything

from completing an assignment
to writing a decent paper.

“Well, we all sat up at that.

Washington & Lee isn’t exactly
Harvard or Yale, but it’s not
one of those tiddlywink colleges
either. The chaplain had told

him...that the simple inability
to do a job had replaced sex and
religion as the Number One pro-
blem in the colleges.”’

Who could be the source of
this defamation on our school’s
character? Granted, students
are a little lazy once in a while,
but really, are we all illiterate?

Anyone who feels he has been
defamed may contact the Ring-
tum Phi, where our legal ex-
perts will explain all about libel
and how to get rich through
lawsuits.

(P.S. — Will the ‘‘chaplain”’
please report to a small public
lynching to be held in his
honor? )

Logo Logic

Everyone knows how impor-
tant a good logo is. The better
they are, the more expensive
they get.

The U.S. Department of
Transportation is paying (with
taxpayer money, of course)
$140,000 to a New York firm to
have its graphics and, perhaps,
the DOT seal redesigned. And,
to put your mind at ease, the
people at DOT have promised to
use up all the old stationery
before they use paper with the
new design.

The Washington
lacrosse team took on the Duke
University Blue Devils in
Durham yesterday, after only a
twoday layoff from their en-
counter with the Virginia
Cavaliers.

The Generals came out well
in a physical match that saw the
temperatures soar into the 90’s.
The Generals walked away with
a 15-4 win, upping their season
record to 6-1, following their
first loss Sunday.

Chris Kearney led the way
with five goals after being shut
out against Virginia, while
three different players, Roman
Kupecky, John Tunney and
George Santos, each scored
twice.

The first half of play was
dominated by the Generals, as
Duke was kept on the defensive
most of the time. Kupecky
Started the scoring at 13:43 of
the first period on a feed from
Mike Pressler.

Tunney then scored on
another pass from Pressler and
the Geenrals had a quick 2-0
lead. Another goal by Kupecky,
followed by a score from Bob
Carpenter and another tally by
Kearney, put W&L in a com-
manding 5-0 lead.

The Blue Devils finally scored
in the second period; but went
into the lockerroom trailing by
four goals.

Neither team looked terribly
sharp in the first half, as there
were wild scrambles for ground
balls and an excessive amount
of slashing fouls. The key to the
Generals’ lead, however, was
their ability to bombard the
Duke goalie with sharp shots.

Generals Lose To Virginia; Beat Duke

 

Chris Kearney (No. 17) and Jay Foster (No. 13) put pressure on UVa goalie during last Sunday’s game.

Generals lost, 13-8.

The second half belonged to
Kearney more than to his team.
Back on track again, Kearney
scored four times in the second
half and, at one point, the 6’8”
attackman reeled off three con-
secutive scores.

By the fourth quarter, the
roughouse hitting began to take
its toll. Carpenter suffered what
was diagnosed as an apparent
concussion in a collision on the
Generals’ end of the field. John
Hooper, who had _ been
dominating the face offs, was
forced to leave earlier with an
apparent separated shoulder. —

“We warned the referees
earlier about cheap shots,”’ said
Coach Jack Emmer,’’ but the
game just got out of hand.”’

Ware Palmer took over in the
goal for Bob Clements in the se-
cond half and gained some
valuable playing time.

Santos, Hooper amd Art
Caltrider each scored early in
the third quarter to boost the
lead to 10-1. After Duke’s se-
cond score, Kearney put in
three goals. The Blue Devils
scored twice more, but John
Sancilio ended the scoring with
a goal to give the Generals the
15-4 win.

Netmen Win Twice On

By Dale Park

For the W&L varsity tennis
team, the last five matches
have turned out to be all-or-
nothing affairs.

Before the break, the netmen
hosted the visiting University of
North Carolina team. As could
be expected, the Division I
Tafheels proved too much foi
the Division III Generals,
walloping W&L 9-0. The
Generals most impressive per-
formances were turned in by
freshman Steve Denny at fifth
singles and the second doubles
team of junior Doug Gaker and
Peter Lovell.

Denny was able to take his
man to 5-5 all before falling 7-5
in the first set and then 6-3 in the
second. Lovell and Gaker, after
dropping th> first set 6-4, came
back to win W&L’s only set of
the day 7-5, yet succumbed in
the third set, 6-4.

During the break, the
Generals were able to compete
in four of their five scheduled
matches, as their match with
Georgia Tech, scheduled for
April 13, was rained out.

The Generals started their
Southern tour. off right,
crushing Division I Stetson 9-0
on April 15. Winners included
senior co-captain. Stewart

Jackson at first singles,
freshman Jack Sharman at se-
cond singles, Lovell at the third
flight, senior co-captain David
Constine at the fourth spot,
Gaker at fifth and Denny at the
sixth flight. Doubles winners in-
cluded Jackson and senior Pat
Norris at the first flight, Gaker
and Lovell at second, and Shar-
man and Constine at the third
spot.

Against N.A.I.A. champ
Flagler College the next day,
the story was entirely different,
as the Generals fell 8-1. The solo
W&L victory was registered by
the second doubles team of
Gaker and Lovell, who posted a
6-0, 4-6, 6-1 win.

Over 13,000 spectators show-
ed up to witness the rivalry and,
when it was all over, the crowd
left sunburned while Virginia
left with a 13-8 victory, having
proven that they are, indeed,
the best team in the nation.

But throughout much of the
game, that position was
challenged by a fine effort on
the Generals’ part. It wasn’t un-
til the fourth quarter, when the
Cavaliers dominated play and
scored five unanswered goals,
that the outcome of the gam’
was apparent.

Washington and Lee struck
first with a goal after the initial
face-off, Attackman Jay Foster
threw it in only 48 seconds in the
first quarter. About a minute
later, Geoff Brent added
another to put the Generals
ahead 2-0.

On April 17, the Generals
traveled to Division II Rollins
College, where the netmen fell
9-0. Yet W&L was able to take
Rollins to three sets at four posi-
tions; Denny at sixth singles
went down fighting 6-3, 3-6, 6-1,
as did the three revamped
doubles flights.

Jackson and Lovell teamed at
first doubles, losing 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.

Virginia then answered with
its first goal, coming at the 8:02
mark on a shot by Lou Ruland.
W&L scored next on an extra
man play, stretching its lead to
3-1.

Two more scores by the
Cavaliers and a final goal by the
Generals ended the period in a
4-4 tie. UVA scored the only goal
in the second quarter, which put
the Wahoos ahead for the first
time, 5-4, at the half.

The third quarter turned into
a see-saw battle with the score
knotted at 6-6 and then again at
7. But with about four minutes
remaining, the Cavaliers found
the handle and took control of
the game.

Carried by a combination of
fine inside passing and consis-
tent wins on the face-offs by
middie Steve Kraus, the
Cavaliers reeled off five
unanswered goals to put them
in the lead for good. By keeping
the Generals on defense for
much of the fourth quarter,
UVA was able to lengthen their
lead to put the final tally at 13-8.

With the victory over W&L,
Virginia secured its first place
ranking and now sports a
record of eight wins and only
one loss. The defeat, the
General’s first, dropped W&L’s
record to 5-1. Standouts for UVA
were Steve Kraus, who won 17
of 27 face-offs, and midfielder
John Driscoll who scored three
goals.

Seven Cavaliers scored one
goal apiece.

For Washington & Lee,
Foster and John Kemp threw in
three each with Roman

Southern Swing

Gaker and Norris were paired
at second doubles, where they
fell 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Constine and
Denny rounded out the doubles
at the third spot, dropping their
three set match, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

But the Generals ended their
southern swing by smashing
Division II Eckerd, 9-0. On the
afternoon, not a single set was
dropped at any W&L position,
and no set was closer than 6-4.

Baseball Team Wins Once Over Break

By Chris Sisto
The varsity baseball team fell
upon some rough times last
week as they compiled a 146
record in a seven day stretch.

After losing a close game 4-2
to Clarion St. before exams they
did not have a game scheduled
for twelve days.

When the Generals returned
to play it appeared that they
lost some of their early season
momentum.

Spring break began and the
team was shelled by Lynchburg

College 17-1, Hampden-Sydney
9-4 and 11-4, and Bridgewater
College 11-2.

The Generals finally got
together and split a double-
header with Eastern Men-
nonite, taking the first game 7-3
but dropping the second 5-4.

Head Coach of the Generals,
Chuck Kroll, does not blame the
team’s collapse on the players.
‘‘We’re not throwing any of the
games away it’s just that our
opponents are playing better
than we are right now.”’

Some of the overall statistics
help point out Kroll’s sentiment.

The team’s .253 batting
average is higher than last
season’s average at this time.
The General’s defense has also
improved. It has committed
fewer errors than last year.

One area that has suffered
some recently is the pitching
department. It gives up an
average of 6.19 earned runs a
game.

The Generals leading pitcher
is senior Chip Childs who has a

UVa Game Shows Lacrosse

By Bill Whalen
Have you ever looked long
and hard into a mirror? At
first; you don’t believe that
what you’re looking at is the
real thing, but after a while, you
accept what is there.

For some reason, this is the
impression I had as I watched
the lacrosse game last Sunday
in Charlottesville. Neither
school will accept it as truth,
but there really was no dif-
ference between the crowds on
opposite sides of Scott Stadium.

And I’m not just talking about
looks, choices of wardrobe or
even which side rooted harder.
When you sit in a neutral corner
of the stadium (which I did) and
compare the W&L and UVA
crowds, you come away with
the feeling that these two
schools are not entirely dif-
ferent in the ways they support
their lacrosse programs.

Figure it this way. The W&L
contingent occupied roughly
one-half of its side of the
stadium. Across the way, the
UVA mob filled up almost
three-fourths of its space. When
you calculate how many girls
from Hollins, Sweet Briar,
Macon, etc. showed up and how
much larger UVA is than W&L,
you get about the same percen-
tage of fans.

Considering that over 13,000
people showed up for the after-
noon showdown, it is evident

that the lacrosse programs are.

alive and strong at both institu-
tions. Sunday’s attendance is
highly indicative that lacrosse
games are rapidly becoming
the Spring social event.

But what about the game
itself? The Generals got off toa
fast start (they scored less
than.a minute into the game)
and seemed on the way to an
upset. But around the half-way
mark, the ‘Hoos’ speed and dep-
th, coupled with the summer-
like weather, were too much for
W&L.

- experience.

There is no real reason for
either W&L fans or players to
panic, however. First, the
Generals lost to undoubtedly
the best team in the nation. Se-
cond, and more importantly,
the pollsters will more than
likely not regard this loss too
seriously.

Although it will go down in the
record books as a loss to
Virginia, the Generals actually
fell victim to the worst enemy of
any unbeaten team — time. The
odds say the Generals were
destined to lose a game.

It’s too bad it had to happen
against Virginia.

Headache

If you’re one of those people
who likes to predict trends in
sports, don’t bother with trying
to predict lacrosse scores this
year. Like the motto the ACC
carried a few years ago: expect
the unexpected.

Once upon a time, the safest
lacrosse gamble was backing
Johns Hopkins to win every
time. That was before the Blue
Jays lost to Virginia and
escaped near-disaster against
Army. -

Following the Maryland
Terps has also been a painful
Predicting a
Maryland score is easy. Just
guess which Maryland team
will show up! the one which
blew out UNC at Chapel Hill or
the one which has lost at home
to Rutgers, Navy and Virginia?

- This Saturday will feature a
lacrosse doubleheader of confu-
sion in the state of Maryland. At
Annapolis, the up-and-down
Middies of the Naval Academy
will host the Virginia squad. At
the same time, Maryland will
be fighting for its life against
Hopkins.

Either way, the Generals will
benefit from these games. If
Virginia and Hopkins win, then
Navy will return near its
season-long No. 8 ranking.
Another loss will give the Terps
four on the year and put them
near the brink of playoff
elimination.

If Virginia wins and Hopkins
loses, the Generals could
possibly take over the No. 2 slot.
But if both Virginia and
Hopkins lose, then what do the
pollsters do?

Answer: Navy will probably
take a jump ala UVA into first
place.

Don’t forget all of this is bas-
ed on the premise that the
Generals will not lose this week.
That too is not guaranteed.

 

 

WEL Will

The Generals, still ranked
third in the nation (this week’s
poll was decided before the
Virginia contest), will next play
Washington College in a 2:00
game this Saturday on Wilson

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Half An Honor
Hearing

The trial proceedings at the recent public Honor
Trial have brought many strong reactions from those
who saw the trial. Many do not realize, though, that
they only saw half of the proceedings. The EC found
that it had a case and pursued it in closed session, as
provided for by the White Book. The student was
found guilty and requested a public trial. He was
acquitted by unanimous vote.

The trial that was presented was incomplete,
though, as the EC could not present its original case
based on original evidence and testimony. There is a
real possibility that the EC’s case seemed so weak
because the testimony it relied on for its original ver-
dict was not the same testimony that was heard in Lee
Chapel.

If the testimony was changed, the EC could not cite
an Honor Violation for lying simply because all EC
members involved in the case would have to dis-
qualify themselves and there would be nobody left to
carry on the proceedings. But had the original
testimony been admissible as evidence, there would
be no changed stories and the students could judge
whether the EC had brought to trial a case that should
never have been tried, as some feel.

Inconsistant with not allowing the testimony from
the closed proceedings is the fact that a deposition
from a witness was used as evidence in the public
trial. A deposition is nothing more than a recorded
and certified testimony, and the information in it
brought more light to the case. Why not allow other
testimony to do the same?

Junior EC representative Bruce Poole has submit-
ted a proposal for a change in the White Book rules
that would allow the testimony from the preliminary
proceedings to be used if and only if there is a public
trial. This proposal would insure that witnesses would
not be inclined to modify their stories and would allow
the student body to see how capable their elected
leaders are in handling matters of such importance.

We do not advocate having the preliminary trial
open to the public as a rule or that the transcripts of
testimony be made available to the public. The only
time the transcripts would be used would be in the
event of an open trial.

Keeping the preliminary trials closed prevents the
situation of the accused being considered guilty by
virtue of his arrest rather than by virtue of his convic-
tion, something well worth protecting in a society as
closed as ours. But open trials are held to allow the
University community the opportunity to consider the
case at hand, the jury decides the verdict and the
gallery insures proper proceedings.

It is most important that the whole student body,
and not just the EC, be presented with the case in its
entirety, rather than the half of it we saw in Lee
Chapel. The EC should accept the proposal in the in-
terests of insuring just proceedings for both parties
involved.

Letters To The Editor
In Favor Of Coeducation

Dear Editor:

I was glad to find that David
Mullin, self-proclaimed racist,
has found a new cause: the
preservation of W&L as a
single-sex school. As_ his
arguments for both show a
similar intellectual foundation,
I can only wonder whether he
construes the two to be similar.

Certainly they are both suffi-
ciently deficient in logic. Mr.
Mullin responds to Palmore
Clarke's argument that
students come to W&L for
academics by claiming that
either: a) the quality of W&L’s
education is superior to that of

co-ed schools because there are
no women here, or b) that Mr.
Clarke is wrong and people
choose W&L because it is all
male.

It seems obvious by the
repugnance and ludicrousness
of the first option that it was
meant as a joke and that Mr.
Mullin therefore wishes to
claim the second as true.

As his solvency Mr. Mullin of-
fers the fact that ‘tabout half’’
of the incoming freshmen each
year come from private
schools, some of which were
single-sex, and that they liked
the experience enough to wish

to continue it in college. The
problem with this argument is
that he is talking about some
nebulous fraction of one-half of
the student body, obviously not
anything approaching a majori-
ty.
Thus, it would seem that Mr.
Mullin has in fact proved
Palmore Clarke's original con-
tention that the majority of in-
coming students don’t know the
impact of single-sex schools
before they matriculate, and
that it does not play that signifi-
cant a part in their decision to
come here.

Now that we've got that

Persiflage

 

I don’t know how it happened. It seems like just
a few months ago I had reordered my life and
developed a plan that would successfully take me:
through the last few terms of my academic
career.

After what some people evidently regarded as a
subpar first term, I had the strongest motivation
to do. well in my last run around the track. I mean,
who wants to find himself out on his own after 22
rather pleasant years as a tax deduction?

Thus, with a clear message from my benefac-
tors I decided it was time to get to work. I would
set the Colonnade on fire with my blazing intellect.
I would amaze teachers with my newly found
dedication and interest. I, in short, would once
again secure for myself a place in the hearts, and
hopefully the house, of my beloved, financially
sound, parents.

Alas, fate conspired to block me from my noble
air. For some cruel and arbitrary reason, the
spirits that be sought to keep me from the love and
economic assistance that only a parent can pro-
vide.

Despite my determination to change, I was
unable to overcome the circumstances that were
forever confronting me. My effort was heroic but

(continued on page 9)

Circumstances Beyond Control

doomed by forces out of my control.

Was it my fault that there is a happy hour the
night before my econ. test? Can a person be ex-
pected to read page after page of obscure texts
written by men long planted in the ground when
great contemporary works can be viewed simply
by turning the dial of a small box? Was I to spend
the best days of my life wasting away in clammy
classrooms when the beauty of snow covered
mountains could be viewed while descending from

their majestic heights?

It should be obvious that I did not stand a
chance.

Nevertheless, some have taken the nar-

rowminded view that I, rather than cir-
cumstances, must bear the responsibility for my
actions. Unfortunately, these closeminded little
twerps went out of their way to publicize their
judgments by mailing their evaluations to my
benefactors. By butting into my private life, these
alleged intellectuals have made my existence into
a living hell. They are just damned lucky that hap-
py hour is still around or I would probably take out
my frustrations by doing several gross and
perverse things to their immediate families.

After all, they ruined my home life why
shouldn’t I return the favor?
(continued from page 8)

straightened out (?), it’s time to
turn to Mr. Mullin’s charge that
the co-ed advocates are trying
to destroy the school and should
leave.

While I don’t think it’s worth
looking at the ramifications of a
mass-exodus of the minimum of
50 percent of the student body
who consistently support
coeducation (which would un-
doubtedly result in the destruc-
tion Mr. Mullin is speaking of),
I would like to examine the
charge that the co-ed advocates
are trying to destroy the school.

The coed advocates do not
want to destroy W&L. In fact,
they feel so strongly for W&L
that they wish to offer their sug-
gestions as to how it might be
improved. It is an unfortunate
fact that many good students
have taken Mr. Mullin’s advice
and have for one reason or
another left, or, have exercised
the ‘‘choice’’ which Messrs.
Mullin and Willhite advocate,
and have chosen not to come.

The problem for W&L is that
many times this involves a good
student, a student who might
have added to the quality of the
student body. Thus, the quality
of the student body has suf-
fered.

And as the quality of a school
is a direct function of the quali-
ty of its students, the quality of
the school has likewise suf-
fered. As such we see that the
“‘choice’’ W&L is giving its ap-
plicants is in fact hurting the
school.

The advocates of co-
education see terrific potential
at W&L, a potential that could
be realized if the school were to
become coed. In addition to pro-
viding the social atmosphere
with a much needed touch of
realism and the broadening of
the intellectual basis of the
school (it seems questionable
that the liberal arts tradition
can grow healthy in an at-
mosphere that excludes one-
half of the intellect of the
populace), W&L would no
longer be stigmatized by stan-
ding out to some as all male, an
attribute which I would suggest
likely turns away at least two
for every one it attracts.

Mr. Mullin and those who
agree with him are in effect
strangling W&L, condemning it
to mediocrity, while the ad-
vocates of co-education are in
effect trying to liberate W&L, to
free it from the shackles which
keep it from attaining the
distinction which it wants and

   
     

   

{

bd er

deserves, a distinction based on
intellectual excellence, not on
its unique single sex status.

The ‘“‘choice” which Messrs.
Willhite and Mullin offer is, as
Mr. Mullin says, much larger
than any one student. It is one of
greatness or mediocrity for
W&L, and the advocates of
coeducation would like to go on
record as casting their vote for
greatness. :

Dear Editor:

I had been following the
series of letters concerning the
values of co-education at W&L
with some interest when I hap-
pened to read Mr. Mullin:s
response in the March 27 issue
of the Phi. The logic of his
arguments was questionable to
say the least.

While I admire the W&L
tradition of an all-male school
and do not favor co-education at
this historic institution, I do feel
it necessary to reply to Mr.
Mullin’s comment that perhaps
students choose W&L over co-ed
schools because ‘“‘the quality of
education at W&L is superior to
that of schools where women
are admitted (perhaps because
we do not admit women).”’

I feel this statement to be a
particularly good example of
why the enrollment of women
would be an asset to W&L To
widen the scope of Mr. Mullin’s
narrow viewpoint, which is
typical of the attitudes of many
students at all-male colleges! I
am not disputing the academic
excellence of W&L, it is certain-
ly a much finer school than
many others that are co-ed.

However, this has nothing to
do with the fact that women are
not enrolled (unless perhaps
Mr. Mullin believes that with
women around he would not be
able to discipline himself
enough to study, and then yes,
his GPA would fall).

He also seems to suggest that
women reduce the quality of
education, yet there are schools
better than W&L and some of
those are co-ed, namely
William and Mary, one of the
most selective schools in the
state, where the women’s
overall GPA is higher than the
men’s!

.,1,would also be willing to
wager that Vassar, which is all-

{ an”)
Sean Gg |

female, can compare to W&L.

Furthermore, having taken
classes at W&L and having met
many students there, I have
found that in general the stu-
dent body would benefit from
learning to be friends with
women and not merely seeing
them as Friday night dates.

Single sex living is unnatural;
the world is not all-male and
some day you will have to learn
to deal with females as well as
males.

Once again, while not ad-
vocating co-education at W&L,
I'd like to say that if everyone
had Mr. Mullin’s attitude of let-
ting tomorrow’s generation im-
plement changes if they want
them, there would be no such
thing as progress and our socie-
ty would stagnate.

If every generation of blacks
had waited and let their
children decide if they wanted
to be free, they’d still be slaves
today and if my _ great-
grandmother had waited for
some successive generation to
open the doors of education to
women, I’d still be at home do-
ing some menial domestic task
instead of in college studying
thermodynamics!

Coeducation Sparks Student Debate

Well then, you also narrowly
answered with the old “‘if not A,
then B’’ argument, by which
neither of your proposals was
an acceptable solution. A, you
said that if people choose W&L
over many other co-ed schools
because of academic quality,
‘then the quality of education
at W&L is superior to that of
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women).”’

It’s OK to think that we may
stand better academically than

ludicrous to think that we are
superior to all of them. Also
where are you coming from to
think that men are always
smarter than women. Probably
W&L. We could say that men
have more aptitude for certain
things than women, but it’s also
vice versa, if you please.

B, Dave says that, well, if not
A, then ‘“‘Mr. Clarke is wrong
and people chose W&L because
it is all male.’’ That, of course
cannot be the only criteria, but
how many people really came

 

Dear Editor:

First of all I'd like to say to
David Mullin that I didn’t think
Mr. Wilson was mocking Jack
Willhite’s ‘“‘clever approach”
which he used to express his
views (hats off to Jack for being
the original one), rather Mr.
Wilson was simply using that
narrative style to present the
other side of the coin.

You see you can argue both
ways. Obviously the issue can’t
be answered with cut and dry
logic. Yet Dave, you later main-
tained that Palmore Clarke’s
argument was too narrow to
support.

He had said that for one, peo-
ple come here for reasons other
than for simply going to an all-
male school, one being for the
pursuit of that abstract stan-
dard we try to define as
“academic quality.’’ He also
said that the introduction of
women to the rolls would result
in an improvement to that

quality:

a lot of co-ed schools, but it’s See W&L, page 10

The Open Honor Trial

The exam week Honor Trial was an event that provoked many
thoughts — some disturbing, some pleasing.

One thought that comes quickly to the mind is that the student in-
volved should have never been brought to a closed Honor Trial in
the first place. The White Book stipulates that 10 members of the
Executive Committee must sit as jurors in any closed Honor Trial.
Two E.C. members excluded themselves from the jury because
they were either the accusers of the student or an important
witness in the case against him. That left 10 members to hear the
case, but one of these was Ed Schenecker, the freshman represen-
tative who was the victim of the Coors Beer theft.

Could Schenecker have believed that he was qualified as an un-
biased juror? Evidently he did because the closed trial was held.
Perhaps Schenecker abstained from voting after the original
testimony was heard, but this is impossible to determine because
the White Book specifies anonimity in the vote. However, the fact
remains, the victim sat as juror.

Another disturbing thought concerns the unrelenting conduct of
the E.C: prosecutors during the open trial. Certainly John Fraser
and Bruce Poole had the responsibility to present to the jury all the
evidence possible that could show that the student was lying. But
after all the testimony was heard, and after it became clear to the
majority of the people in Lee Chapel that there was not enough
evidence to convict the student (this at least became clear to the
jury), the prosecution’s responsibility to attack ended.

But John Fraser continued the attack after all the testimony was
heard. In his summation he used rhetorical devices to ingratiate
himself with those who must pass judgment, he used convoluted
logic in his reasoning, and at times he came very close to twisting
the testimony to serve his purpose — all to convince the jury of the
student’s guilt. This advocacy to the end may be standard practice
in a court of law, but the objective of our Honor System is the trust
— regardless of which side of the bench it comes from.

Common sense and good judgment, not to mention a legal educ-
tion, should have told John Fraser that the evidence needed to con-
vict the accused was lacking. Those same attributes should have
told Fraser that his conduct could have done far more damage to
the Honor System than the student and his cronies could ever do.
How many of the spectators in the crowded gallery will be reluctant
to turn a fellow student in for a possible Honor Violation after they
have witnessed the E.C. prosecution try every trick in the book to
throw the accused out of school?

Another thought crosses the mind: Is the common sense and good
judgment on the part of Ed Schenecker and the E.C. prosecution
reflective of the common sense and good judgment that we, the stu-
dent body, used in electing our E.C. representatives? Did we
carefully pick the best candidate for the job? Did we even have a
choice of the best candidates possible? Perhaps now more of us will
have a better understanding of the awesome responsibility we
delegate in the E.C. elections. Perhaps now more of us will discuss
the candidates and the issues so that we may cast our votes more
wisely. Perhaps now more of us will choose to seek office rather
than to let E.C. seats be won unchallenged.

After all possible thoughts concerning the Honor Trial are
evaluated, one is left with the pleasant realization that in this case
the Honor System worked. The checks and balances built into the
system to protect the innocent arose from the White Book and flex-
ed its muscles, demanding that the accused be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Once again it was proven that the best
path to the truth is through an informed and concerned public. But
must we wait for another student to sit in Lee Chapel for the judg-
ment of his peers before we once again become informed and con:

about to go through again. |
went to a boys’ school in
Virginia which I would consider
the perfect prep school for the
stereotyped image of W&L tor
over a vear.

I later went to a Quaker prep
school that’s been co-ed since if
started in 1789 tor my last two
vears ‘how’s that for a tradi-
tion), For me the experience
revealed an intense difference
in atmospheres) produced tor
men by either the presence or
absence of female peers. |
sincerely felt’ a co-educational
experience Was much_ better
‘not to say that those who go to
a single sex school have
miserable lives)

Consequently I came to W&L,
but not because it was all-male,
and not specifically — for
academic reasons either. I
came mostly because of the ex-
cellent) opportunities at the
radio station and because | love
Virginia cand especially Lex-
ington) and the physical plant
ol W&L

There are a multitude ot
reasons for being here besides it
being all-male, and T guarantee
you many others here now
believe it would be the ultimate
school if only it was co-ed.

Mr. Mullin contends that if we
go co-ed we will be imposing our
views on all of tomorrow's
students. Have you ever con-
sidered that maybe if you are
here because you liked the idea
of an all-male school then you
have had someone elses will im-
posed upon you, distorting your
concept of the “natural environ-
ment.”

There’s nothing prestigious
about maintaining a single sex
atmosphere. Its outdated and
inhibiting. You're excluding a
whole side of society from your
day to day experience, How can

that be beneficial? I think it’s
pigheaded.

Finally, and get this, he says
that “W&L is bigger than any
student.” Does this imply that
my existence here is to help
support and perpetuate — this
sytem rather than this system
filling and replenishing me in
the best way possible? You can
only knock down the wall when
you see that it has obstructed
your path.

I hope that I have brought a

different insight to those who
might have thought otherwise
about’ the merits of co-
education. I would also like to
thank David Mullin for provok-
ing me into writing these
thoughts down.

And finally I would like to pro-
pose we lay out plans for a
modestly scaled exchange pro-
gram for the spring of next
year. Anybody willing to work
on this?

Flying Bottles And
Child Psychology

Dear Editor:

I'm having a problem which I
find hard to understand. It in-
volves the psychology of the
group of young vandals who
throw bottles out of the upper
areas of Graham-Lee  dor-
mitory.

The other night, an acquain-
tance and I were returning from
a rather interesting evening at
a friend of our’s home in the
quiet country surrounding Lex-
ington. (Little did we know we'd
be there until 3a.m.).

Anyway, we were moving
slowly into the quad, tired and
ready for the sack, when a huge
36 0z. bottle comes sailing out of
an upper story window. It just
missed my head. If that thing
had hit us, it would have been a
major trauma — kinda like
sleeping througha test.

So, we went inside, discussed
the near fatal incident, and
went to bed. That's where we
are now and if you think at all
like I do, then you'd be ready to
gotosleep.

McDaniel Work Published

An article by John M.
McDaniel, associate professor
of anthropology at Washington
and Lee University, entitled
“Effects of Behavioral and
Ecological Variations Upon the
Incidence of Parasitic Disease

Among la Gente of Concepcion,

Peru,” is included by Mouton
Publishers in a_ recently
published reader on medical an-
thropology, ‘Spirits, Shamans
and Stars.”’

The anthology is one of a new
series under the general title of
“World Anthropology,” edited
by Prof. Sol Tax of the Universi-
ty of Chicago. The series is a
product of the ninth Interna-
tional Congress of Anthropo-
logical and Ethnological

Sciences, held in 1973.

McDaniel began teaching an-
thropology and archaeology
courses at W&L in 1971, and he
received his Ph.D. degree from
the University of Pennsylvania
a year later. From 1974 through
its conclusion in 1979, he
directed the Liberty Hall ex-
cavations, unearthing evidence
about Washington and Lee’s
18th-century predecessor in-
Stitution. The results of that
research were eventually
printed in a series of articles
and longer pieces, notably, the
monograph ‘‘Liberty Hall
Academy: The Early History of
the Institutions Which Evolved
Into Washington and Lee
University,” published last fall.

Richmond.

The Bishop exhibition will be

to what is still a new event in the
community.” He said the spon-
sors hope to have an exhibition
of the award-winning photo-
graphs and other entries after
the contest next year.

 

Power Out
For 2 Days

A burned-out underground
cable caused a power outage
Monday in Lewis Hall and the
Woods Creek Apartments.

The electricity went out at
6:11 p.m. (according to one
Woods Creek clock) and af-
fected ‘‘just that one zone,” ac-
cording to Buildings and
Grounds Superintendent James
L. Arthur.

The trunk line was damaged,
said Arthur, and now the job is
to locate and replace the old
cable.

A new cable was laid and
power was restored by 5:30
p.m., Tuesday.

Changeling

to members of the cast, and
while the haunted house ritual
may seem tiresome, it is bless-
ed with good production values
in design and photography. The
supporting cast is not used to
any real potential, with
Madeleine Sherwood and John
Colicos filling small parts.

The Changeling is well made,
occasionally convincing, and
certainly better than most re-
cent efforts to revive the genre.
It is considerably milder in its
content that it’s R rating might
suggest.

time that the beer was in the
room.

Some witnesses testified that
the accused was either asleep of
appeared to be asleep shortly
after the Nighthawks concert.

Evidence of cans and six-
pack wrappers from the miss-
ing case of Coors beer was in-
troduced to document that the
beer was in the room that night.

In the preliminary investiga-
tion the accused said the only
thing he saw in relation to Coors
beer was an empty six-pack
wrapper in the bushes outside of
the dormitory room.

He said he did not see this un-
til the following morning
around noon.

A deposition from an area
youth was introduced as
evidence in relation to this
testimony.

The youth said he saw several
full cans of Coors beer in the
same bushes before 10 a.m.
Saturday.

When the investigative team
searched these bushes they
found the wrapper the accused
saw and a few empty cans of
Coors.

The key testimony in the case
appeared to be that of one of the
freshman in the room during
the time in question.

This witness testified that he
had fallen asleep around 8 p.m.
and awoke about midnight.

He said that he entered the
room shortly after the other
witnesses arrived from the con-
cert and stayed for roughly one
hour.

During the time he was in the
room, the witness said he saw
no Coors and that the accused
was asleep when he left.

The accused took the witness
stand and testified that he had
been drinking heavily from late

that afternoon until after the
concert.

He said that when he entered
the dormitory room he became
concerned because it was late,
he was drunk and he had a
lacrosse game that day.

He testified that he was a
good friend of the person who
lives in the room and that the
person was out of town for the
night.

The accused testified that he
decided to sleep in the room
because his room is four flights

up and he knew the owner of the
room would not mind.

The accused said that he slept
in the room and woke up bet-
ween 9 and 10 a.m. Saturday.

He said that at no time did he
see any Coors beer in the room.

The testimony of the accused
was followed by the final sum-
mations to the jury.

The jury withdrew from the
chapel shortly before 6 p.m. and
returned the unanimous deci-
sion of not guilty shortly before
8 p.m.
