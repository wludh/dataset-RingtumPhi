EC Considers Coeducation

by Joe Scott

A subcommittee studying
coeducation at Washington and
Lee was created by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

Members will consist of two
EC representatives, Senior Jay
Blumberg and Vice President
Les Cotter, and an additional
four subcommittee members
will be drawn from the student
body.

Blumberg, who brought up
the motion, said a student body
survey will be conducted to ac-
curately poll opinion on the
question of coeducation. “This
one would be completely ac-
curate,’ said Blumberg who
complained that last year’s
Ring-tum Phi survey could
have been misrepresentative.
“The Ring-tum Phi survey only
took those who wanted to vote,”’
said Blumberg. “By computer
random sampling we could be
sure of accuracy,” he said.

Michael Cappeto, Associate
Dean of Students, has offered to
be the faculty advisor because
of his experience in conducting
other public opinion surveys.

       

 

Other EC representatives
questioned the survey’s ac-
curacy noting students could
give their “gut reaction’ and
not a carefully thought out. opi-
nion. ‘The survey is really pret-
ty worthless unless the students
are aware of the pros and
cons,” said Senior EC Rep. Dee
Kessler. Blumberg responded
by saying it was “impossible to
know all the pros and cons of
coeducation.”

The subcommittee will report
back to the EC when the ques-
tionnaire is completed.

Students interested in being a
subcommittee member should
submit their typed request to

Buttoning
Up For

Vacation

by Sam Campbell

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby made several sugges-
tions for students who are leav-
ing for Thanksgiving vacation
this weekend. ‘‘Holidays are
when (thieves) hit us pretty
hard. The more precautions the
students take, the better off we
will be.”’

Kirby said the following
things should be done to ensure
the safety of your possessions
while you're away:

—all doors and windows should

be locked and anything of value

should be removed or hidden;

—if you have a paper delivered

to your door, have it discon-

magazine but added that if
release occurred in December,
he should retain some of the 400
copies for a January distribu-
tion.

Discussion on the Commerce
School exam distribution ended
in an EC recommendation that
“they should divide it up.”’

Vice President Les Cotter
said he talked to Dean Edward
C. Atwood about the problem
but Atwood responded by claim-
ing the problem was not as
severe as thought.

“It’s definitely a zoo situa-
tion,’’ said Cotter. EC President
Steve Abraham agreed saying
that he “‘sees it as a strain on
the honor system.”’ Abraham
suggested exams be handed out
in the same manner as the
history department. There, said
Abraham, individual teachers
call out the names and hand
each student an exam.

EC Third Year Law Rep.
John Fraser said the Campus
Security Committee’s formal
report will be delayed until
after Thanksgiving vacation
“because of the generally poor
response.’’ He cited lack of at-
tendance at the two security
committee open hearings as one
example.

Fraser said approximately 30
letters sent out had _ been
answered by students, mostly
female law students, and that
the subcommittee was still talk-
ing to those people.

The possibility of offering ex-
tracurricular courses during
the winter term was brought up
by EC Rep. Bruce Poole. The
courses, said Poole, would
range from self-defense to
bartending. EC First Year Law
Rep. Sam Allen, who with Poole
will study the possibility this
winter, said a similar program
he backed at University of
Mississippi was very successful
and well attended.

Colvin Speaks On
SALT II Treaty

by David Greer
The SALT II treaty “is an
issue about which honest men
and women can honestly dis-
agree,”’ said Dr. Milton Colvin
in a lecture on the treaty Tues-
day night.

Colvin, professor of politics at
Washington and Lee, said SALT
is ‘‘one of the most complex in-
ternational documents ever.”’
Colvin said his remarks would
try to ‘get at the sense and
spirit of SALT.”

Colvin favors ratification of
SALT, and suggests that one
read the document or at least
familiarize oneself with the
facts of the document before
forming an opinion. Colvin said
it is a matter of co-existence or
co-incineration.

ty, which Colvin called a

IFC Endorses New Fraternity

by John Billmyre

A group of 15 students is try-
ing to re-establish the local
chapter of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity, which folded under
financial pressure in 1970.

The group took an important
first step Tuesday night when
the Interfraternity Council
unanimously approved a mo-
tion to endorse re-establish-
ment,

According to the IFC Con-
stitution, fraternities that want
a charter at the university must
receive approval from the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee as well
as the IFC.

All social fraternities are re-
quired to be members of the
IFC.

If the group receives SAC’s
approval, it will approach its
National Chapter to establish a

“colony” at Washington and
Lee.

The group will become a
member of the IFC upon receiv-
ing colony status from Kappa
Sigma National.

Tony Weiss, a local represen-
tative of the National Fraterni-
ty, explained to IFC represen-
tatives that the group, if
granted colony status, will have
to prove itself worthy of receiv-
ing a charter.

He said the colony will need 30
charter members who are in-
itiates before it can become an
active chapter.

“No colony can become a
chapter in less than 90 days or
more than two years,” said
Weiss.

Weiss added that the national
fraternity is particularly in-
terested in re-establishing the

chapter at Washington and Lee
because it is the fraternity’s
third oldest chapter.

Kappa Sigma was established
at W&L in 1873.

Several IFC representatives,
noting that the original Kappa
Sigma went into debt so deeply
it had to sell its house to pay
debts, asked Weiss how Kappa
Sigma National plans to help
the local group.

“Harvey Allen, President of
Washington and Lee’s Alumni
Association, has pledged his
moral and financial support,”’
said Weiss.

He said that 900 alumni have
graduated from the Washington
and Lee chapter of Kappa
Sigma and that he anticipated a
great deal of support from those

graduates.

ty,” areas follows:

A ceiling of 2,250 launch
vehicles for each country; the
US will have to build more to
reach this ceiling, the USSR
would have to scrap some. Col-
vin noted that only 400 missiles
could destroy the Soviet Union
and 300 could destroy the United
States.

Of the 2,250, only 1,320 could
be MERV missiles (MERV
missiles carry several smaller
missiles launched from the
main missile much the same
way a shotgun shell works com-
pared toa rifle bullet.)

Each country will be allowed
820 ICBMs to be MERVed.

The Soviets will be limited to
300 heavy missiles (which they
already have). The US will not
be allowed any heavy missiles,
but the US has not developed
any and has instead based its
defense program on _ light
missiles. The United States
negotiators made the decision
to include this clause.

There are no limits on mobile
ICBM systems such as the pro-
posed MX system.

Aircraft that can carry cruise
missiles will be limited to a
2,500 mile cruising range.

Prior notification must be
given of testing.

Neither country may in-
terfere with the other’s verifica-
tion processes.

The Backfire bomber is not
under the treaty, but the USSR
agreed to limit production to 30
per year. Colvin pointed out
that the Backfire bomber has a
range of 5,000 miles and
therefore could not strike the
US and return to Russia.

‘“‘Nuclear war is not much of a
threat.’’ Colvin said. adding

“Do you realize the difficulty
of starting a _ fraternity?”
Hamill asked Weiss and student
representative Dan Schott.

‘I've already traveled a long

and rocky road to get this far,”
said Schott.

Perkins asked Weiss about
Kappa Sigma’s goals and
pledge program.

Weiss said the pledge pro-
gram involves guest speakers,
community services and fund-
raising projects, and is design-
ed to give participants an
understanding of brotherhood.

“The goal of Kappa Sigma is
to be the best or one of the best

SPE Case Goes To SAC

The Judicial Board of the In-
terfraternity Council turned a
discipline case over to the Stu-
dent Control Committee Tues-
day night.

“We are not really getting
anywhere with this case, so we
are turning it over to Student
Control,’’ said IFC Presidnet
Syd Farrar.

It was the second time in as
many weeks that the IFC heard
information about the case.

The case involves a raid on
the Sigma Phi Epsilon house by
another fraternity or a group of
students.

IFC Secretary Sam Perkins
conducted an investigation into
the raid and estimated $800
worth of damage to Sig Ep pro-
perty.

Perkins mentioned that no
one was willing to talk about the

incident and Farrar said he
believed Student Control might
be able to gather more
evidence.

According to Judicial Board
members, all evidence
presented thus far was second
and third hand.

From what the Judicial
Board was able to establish, at
11:30 on Halloween night, about
a dozen people ran through the
Sig Ep house, breaking a com-
posite photograph, a television
set and two speakers and ruin-
ing a stereo cabinet.

An antique photo, a banner
and a composite photograph
were listed as missing after a
second raid, which occurred at
midnight.

Perkins said the bill for
damages could be even higher
because the television has not
been checked yet.

endorse Kappa Sigma shortly
before the vote and several
representatives expressed
doubt that W&L needs another
fraternity.

But IFC President Syd Far-
rar spoke in favor of the motion.

“T really don’t think there is
any reason to be paranoid about
having another house on cam-
pus,” said Farrar. He added
that fraternities worried about

_ increased competition should

probably examine their house.

Junior justice Monte Briscoe
asked Assistant Dean of
Students Dan Murphy if the IFC
would be responsible if Kappa
Sigma got into financial trou-
ble.

Murphy explained that the
fraternity is responsible for its
debts and financial affairs.

Student
Assaulted

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent was assaulted Thursday
night while walking home to his
McCorkle Drive apartment.

Junior Frank Jones said he
was walking past the VMI
athletic bridge at 11:30 p.m.
when a car loaded with four or
five men and one woman stop-
ped, verbally abused Jones, and
they started pushing him
around. The persons fled when

Law Students Win
Moot Court Debates

A team of law students from
the School of Law at
Washington and Lee University
won first place in a four-state
regional round of the National
Moot Court Competition in
Richmond last week, Nov. 3-4.

Members of the three-man
team were second-year law
students William J. Milani,
Buckner P. Wellford and Kerry
M. Wilson. Law professor
Samuel W. Calhoun served as
the team’s advisor.

The group was judged on the
basis of a written brief and an
oral argument, counting 40 and
60 percent of the score, respec-
tively. As in previous years, the
problem was devised by
members of the New York Bar
Association and was used in all
14 Moot Court regions.

The argument this year dealt
with the Seventh Amendment
“right to jury” in civil actions
that are so complex or technical
that a jury cannot comprehend
the details of the case. Each
team was required to argue
both sides of the question and,
as in the written portion of the
competition, was judged by a
group of Richmond attorneys.

The regional tournament
drew 24 teams from a total of 14
law schools in Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina and
Kentucky. A second W&L team
— composed of students Clara
Smith, John Sullivan, and Neal
Brickman — won against a

team from the University of
Northern Kentucky, but drop-
ped out of play after losing to
the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill by a tenth
of a point.

 

 

Student
Convicted
For Accident

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent has been found guilty of
one count each of hit and run
and reckless driving following
his arrest Halloween night.

Murry G. McClintock, a
senior, answered the charges in
Lexington General District
Court on Nov. 13. He pleaded
guilty to both offenses.

Early on the morning of Nov.
1, McClintock hit a parked Dat-
sun on Washington Street in
front of Davis dormitory and
fled the scene. He was stopped
on Rt. 11 North and charged
with driving under the influence
of alcohol and hit and run. Blood
tests showed a 0.22 percent con-
centration of alcohol in his
blood stream. (0.1 percent con-
stitutes legal intoxication in
Virginia.

McClintock was fined $100 for
reckless driving, $50 for hit and
run, and court costs. In addi-
tion, his privilege to drive in
Virginia was suspended for six
months.

 

 

Thwarting Thieves

tinued during the holiday ;
—also, if you own expensive
sound equipment, which is in
great demand by thieves, write
down the serial numbers and
store them ina safe place.

If you live in town or in the
country, it would be a good idea
to notify your neighbors that
you are leaving and how long
you will be gone.

Another precaution is to
notify the police or sheriff's
department and they will make
periodic checks on your proper-

ty.

Kirby’s advise for fraternity
members living in the chapter
house is to make sure the house

is locked.
‘“‘We have no way of knowing

who’s going or coming from
fraternity houses. A lot of times
we can see a person in a house
and we don’t know whether he’s
a fraternity member or not,”
the police chief said.

Several recent robberies of
students during the current
school year should provide the
incentive to lock up houses and
protect possessions during the
upcoming holiday.

Stolen Camera Found

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent’s camera, worth $400, has
been located after two weeks of
searching by the student and
Lexington police.

The camera was reported
missing from the student’s se-
cond floor library carrel on Oct.
6...

It turned up a week later in
the Jefferson Street Second
Hand Shop. A student who had
used the camera once recogniz-
ed the camera and noticed the

owner’s name engraved on the
camera.

The owner was notified and
went to the store with a police
officer.

But the camera had already
been sold to a W&L faculty
member who gave it to his son.

The owner of the store iden-
tified the man who sold him the
camera and notified police.

Police have been _ in-
vestigating the incident but
have not made an arrest yet.

Students Attend Conference

Wade Forsman and Thomas
Lisk, both seniors at
Washington and Lee University
participated in a major
academic conference on the
Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty at Hampden-Sydney
College on Oct. 18, 19, and 20.

Nationally-known experts on
arms control and defense
policies had gathered at the Col-
lege to speak out about their
views on the proposed SALT II
Treaty before one hundred and
fifty students from mid-Atlantic
colleges and universities.
 

Eye & Ear:From

It all begins with a Sunday morning trek to the
Hop-In store. The New York Times and the
Washington Post weigh over five pounds and cost
$2.29. Cheap by printed-work prices today.

There is a certain ritual to be followed in dealing
with this accumulated mass of news, opinions, and
advertisement. A broad expanse of living room
floor is essential, none of which will be visable by
evening.

First comes the sorting out. All colored inserts of
drug store mart sales, all apartments and houses
for rent and sale in New York suburbs are pulled out
for direct delivery to the fireplace. The remaining
sections of both papers are then divided into two
sprawling piles. One contains the comics, Parade,
Outlook, the sports news. These get read with the
support of a large glass of sherry before lunch.

Then the serious gnawing on the solid stack of the
second pile begins. ‘“‘What have you done with the
Post Book World?”’ ‘‘No, I haven’t read the News In
Review yet, so don’t put it with the throw-aways.”’
‘‘Where is Miss Manners and Art Buchwald?”’ ‘‘The
continued part of the article I’m reading is in the
section you’ve got!”’

For business reasons the book reviews get a
careful going over. Someone is sure to turn up
tomorrow saying that he can’t remember the name
of the book but it was in the New York Times Book

Kecore

Entertainment

 

The Bookstore

Review on Sunday. Barbara Tuchman has a long
review—depressing—on Henry Kissinger’s White
House Years. She wonders if he has his eye on
elected office and I wonder how many more copies I
should order.

There’s a fascinating book about an unusual
plant, Amaranth, which has a very high protein con-
tent and could help the growing starvation in our
over-populated planet. This is balanced by the arti-
cle about the Thai doctor who pedals around the
country peddling birth control materials along with
ice cream cones and tee shirts which say ‘‘Not So
Many Children.”’

By evening, it’s time to try the New York Times
crossword puzzle. ‘‘Afghan City” ‘Rain forest
plant”’ and “Song hit of 1934’. Fiends must make up
these tortures. Only thing to do is give up on the
lower right hand corner.

Finally, the news itself in all its far-flung
coverage. These Sunday summaries put a perspec-
tive on the week’s piecemeal information. Perhaps
one’s understanding becomes a bit broader; cer-
tainly one’s feelings are heavier. At day’s end,
awash in newsprint, surfeited of words and awed by
the mere logistic of producing such weekly tomes,
the prospect of going back to work next morning
seems simplicity itself.

Rewiew

Independent Record Company
Enters S.F.’s Record Industry

by Mark Kinniburgh
I have determined that the
difference between large record
companies and small, indepen-
dent record companies can be
measured by their enthusiasm
and personal attention.

Enter 415 Records of San
Francisco and another indepen-
dent label with lessons to still be
learned by Warner, Columbia,
and Capitol. 415 began on the
philosophy that the new wave
musie of San Francisco was
good, and the time was right to
start producing records for the
energetic public of San Fran-
cisco’s new wave underground.

To begin, 415 Records does
not sign artists who only have
studio releases or previous ef-
forts on other labels. They opt,
instead for working bands with
local followings and firm roots
in the music they are playing.

Day to day business at 415
Records is not as fast paced as
would be a day at Warner Bros.,
but then again, the money of big
business hype is not present at
415.

When I called San Francisco
for information on 415, I was
treated very kindly on the
phone, and less than a week
later I received all the material
I had asked for and more. Ma-

jor labels with a whole staff
devoted to correspondence can-
not match that figure under any
circumstances.

Howard Klein of the founding
duo at 415 also puts emphasis on
college radio and young record
buyers: ‘Colleges are much
more open to new music, things
that aren’t on major labels.”’
Klein also cites the outrageous
album pricing scale as a real
deterrent to the would-be album
buyer, and explains that opera-

. tions at 415 are geared for ex-

posure rather than sales.

When a major label decides to
print thousands of copies of a
particular single, ‘‘that’s when
the money comes in.” In the in-
terest of exposure, prices of 45’s
and 7’ EP’s are lower than
most commercial singles on the
415 label, and the investment of
a buck is low to hear some of the
trend-setting music around to-
day. Here is a rough sampling
of 415 artists:

ed “‘too aggressive for an open-
ing band”’ by the Rolling Stone,

Sports

From the Pressbox
Exit, Atkinson

by Ray MeNulty
Sports Editor

Thank you Stewart Atkinson.

Thank you for four years of thrilling and exciting
football. Four years—it went by so quickly.

I can still remember 1976—our freshman year at
W&L. I remember watching you cut through defenses
for 469 yards, averaging 3.2 yards per carry. And
don't forget your average of 13.3 yards per catch and
four touchdowns. It might not have been a fantastic
year, but it was a start.

And what a start it was.

In 1977 as a sophomore—despite playing in only
eight games—you rushed for a total of 767 yards, a 4.6
yards-per-carry average and an average of 95.9 yards
a game. This includes two 200-yard efforts. In addi-
tion, you scored six touchdowns—a feat you would
repeat as a junior and senior. At the end of the season
you were a second-team AIl-ODAC selection at run-
ning back—not bad for a sophomore.

1978 may have been your finest year. Only a junior,
you started all of (the team’s) 10 games, set a school
rushing record for most yards gained in one season
(928) and became W&L’s all-time leading rusher with
2,164 yards. You scored six touchdowns averaging 4.7
yards per carry, 92.8 yards per game and 10 yards per.
catch. You were chosen as W&L’s “offensive player
of the game”’ three times and led the team in rushing,
scoring and total offense. Again you were a second-
team All-ODAC selection. What a year!

And your senior year was no disappointment.
Rushing for another 908 yards in 1979, you ended your
W&L career with a school-record 3,072 yards rushing.
Despite the team’s dismal 3-7 record, you went out a
winner.

In your final game, you gained 103 yards on 24 car-
ries and scored two touchdowns to lead W&L to vic-
tory. Your 103 yards enabled you to go over 900 yards
for the season and 3,000 yards for your career. Had it
not been for that shoulder injury in the fourth quarter,
you were a sure bet to break your own single-season
rushing record—you only needed another 20 yards.

The injury was unfortunate, but the ovation you
received was touching. As you walked off the field;
the standing ovation you received was the W&L fans’
way of saying, ‘“Thank you, Stew—you were great!

And great you were.

In 38 games at W&L you: set the school’s career
rushing record with 3,072 yards; averaged over 4.5
yards per carry; averaged over 80 yards per game;
averaged over 11 yards per catch; scored a school-
record 22 touchdowns; set the school’s single-season
rushing record with 928 yards in 1978; had two 200-
yard games (215 against Bridgewater and 213 against
Georgetown) in 1977—both single-game records; and
had the second-longest run from scrimmage in W&L’s
history (82 yards) in 1977.

At W&L, you were the best. You’ve done everthing
the football program could ask of you—and then
some. And W&L has tried to show its appreciation.
You were a second-team all-conference selection in
1977 and 1978, you won the Dan Ray Justice Memorial
Award as W&L’s offensive player of the year in both
1977 and 1978, you were selected as team captain in
1979,.and of course, that wonderful ovation you receiv-
ed when you left Wilson Field for the final time in a
W&L uniform. Each time, someone was saying thank
you.

And so with your brilliant college career now com-
plete, we must say it once again. From myself, the
Ring-tum Phi and the rest of the W&L student body,

‘Thank you Stewart Atkinson—you were great.”

 

Generals Upset Hoyas;
Final Record Is 3-7

by Dale Park

Take two running backs who
gain over one hundred yards
each, add a quarterback who
throws for one hundred more,
toss in a solid performance by
the defense in crucial situations
and what do you get — W&L's
stunning 28-20 victory over the
Georgetown Hoyas last. Satur-
day.

The victory gave the
Generals a 3-7 final record for
the season. Yet more im-
portantly, the win offered the
3,182 fans the chance to see an
entirely new offensive look for
W&L.

Quarterback Rich Hachen-
burg played virtually the entire
game, completing 11 of 20
passes for 115 yards, and led a
much more daring and diver-
sified Generals’ offense.

‘“‘Hachenburg did a fine job,”
said Head Coach Gary Fallon.
‘Rich lost his job earlier in the
season and it would have been
easy for him to become disillu-

sioned, but he struck with it and

came back.”’

After falling behind 7-0 early
in the first quarter, the
Generals engineered a brilliant
16-play, 80-yard scoring drive.
Led by Hackenburg, W&L held
the ball for over six minutes,
running and passing eight times
each during the series. Hachen-
burg took the ball ir in himself
from two yards out, and
Freshman kicker Bill Devine
added the conversion to tie the
score at 7-7.

“We've got the offensive
weapons,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘We
kept them guessing with the
pass and then we would throw a
delay draw at them with Stew
(Atkinson) or Lee (Minetree).”’

The defense play superbly in
the final stages of the game, yet
had trouble’ containing
Georgetown quarterback Bob
Gerard. Gerard, who broke a
41-yard run to set up the Hoyas’
first score, finished the after-
noon with 81 yards.

 

Stewart Atkinson leaves the
game with a 4th quarter injury.

Georgetown immediately
countered with a 12 play, 59
yard scoring drive, culminating
with a six-yard Gerard-to-tight
end Keith Speidel touchdown
pass that resulted in a 14-7
Georgetown lead.

At this point the Generals’
defense stiffened. Holding the
Hoyas on some crucial short
yardage situations, the defense
gave Hachenburg the ball.
Hackenburg in turn gave the
Generals a 14-14 halftime score,
taking his team 55 yards in
eight plays.

The drive was completed as
Senior tailback Stewart Atkin-
son plunged in from one yard
out. Said Fallon, ‘‘the defense
seemed to be taken aback at
first, yet quickly established
itself as the offense came to
life.”’

The stars of the offensive
rebirth, especially in the third
quarter, were Atkinson and
junior fullback Lee Minetree.
Atkinson gained 104 gards on 24
carries, while Minetree picked
up 124 yards on 11 carries.

Atkinson gave W&L the lead
for the first time on his two yard
touchdown run in the third
quarter. Devine missed his first

 

extra point of the season,
however, and the Generals took
a 20-14 lead.

Yet it was Minetree who
“really ignited the offensive ef-
fort’’ in Fallon’s words. On
W&L’s very next posssssion the
junior fullback raced 71 yards
for a touchdown on a brilliant
piece of running.

Freshman Chris Cavalline
made up for the missed extra
point by scampering in for the
two point conversion with a fine
second effort, giving the

_ Generals a 28-14 lead.

Yet a tough Hoyas team came
right back. Return man Jim
Corcoran took the ball all the
way to the W&L yard line.
Three plays later, Georgetown
running back John Federico
scored on a ten yard run. But

the Hoyas’ two point conversion
attempt failed and the score re-
mained 28-20, W&L.

For the enitre fourth quarter
the defense held the Hoyas at
bay. ‘Seeing another wishbone
offense for the second straight
week helped us,”’ said Fallon.

Outstanding defensive
players were senior defensive
back Gene Newtown,
sophomore linebacker Bob
Shaver and freshman
linebacker Bob Boyle, who each
had one interception. Shaver
was especially crucial in stop-
ping a final Georgetown scoring
threat by breaking up a Hoyas’
asss that might have tied the
score. .

The victory was marred by
Stewart Atkinson’s shoulder in-
jury in the fourth quarter.
W&L’s all-time leading ground-
gainer had to be helped from
the field after having his right
shoulder separated during a
scramble for a loose ball.

Atkinson finished the season
with 908 yards, bringing his
career total to a record 3072
yards. Yet more importantly
for Atkinson and the Generals,
they finished the season as win-
ners.

Cagers Out To Regain ODAC
With Deep, Talented Squad

Ass’t. Sports Editor

On Saturday, Nov. 24, while
most of us will be home eating
turkey leftovers, the
Washington & Lee basketball
team will be opening its 1979-80
season here in Lexington. This
years marks the fifteenth
season the team has been under
the guidance of Verne Canfield,

whose career record at W&L is
242-136, for a winning percen-
tage of .640.

This year’s squad enters the
new season with plenty of bad
memories from last year’s 17-10
season—disappointing only by
W&L’S standards. “Our goals
this year are to reach our fullest
potential as a team, win the

ODAC Championship and go to
the NCAA Tournament,” said
Canfield.

In trying to reach these goal,
the Generals will be a squad
which is more inexperienced
than in past seasons. This
year’s team consists of six
freshmen, four sophomores,
three juniors and only two
seniors.

“Our experience level is not
as high as in the past,’’ said
Canfield, ‘‘but we can become a
good basketball team if we gain
experience. It’s a daily process
we're going through,’’ added
the coach, ‘‘but it will pay off as
the season progresses.”’

One reason for Canfield’s op-
timism is the team’s incredible
depth at each position. In
almost every case, there are at
least two men who can come in-
to the game and do something

Water Polo Ends Year
By Upsetting Richmond

by Dave Johnson

The 1979 W&L Water Polo
team wrapped up their most
successful season ever with one
win and two losses at the NCAA
Eastern Regionals last
weekend. The Generals flew to
Chicago for the tournament, in
which they were defeated by
Bucknell and Indiana before
demolishing rival Richmond in
their final game. The weekend’s
results bring the team’s season
record to an impressive 20-7.

In the Generals’ first game,
played against Bucknell, W&L

lost 19-8 in what Coach Page -

Remillard described as ‘‘the
best team we played all year.”’
Bucknell went on to take the
tournament championship by
defeating Chicago Circle.
Despite the score, the Generals
played well, improving greatly
in an area that has been a
weakness the entire season—
the man advantage situation.

The offensive punch for W&L
was supplied by senior co-
captain Biff Martin, who scored
four of the Generals’ eight
goals. Freshman Bob Marshall
and sophomore Steve LaPrade
drew praises from Remillard
for their play coming off the
bench.

W&L’s next game was a 13-9
defeat at the hands of Indiana.
The game was close throughout

and could have been won by
either team.

The reason that the victory
went to Indiana, according to
Remillard, .is that W&L
“underestimated our potential
for improvement.” In other
words, if they had known a
month or even a week ago how
well they were capable of play-
ing, then they would have had
the necessary confidence to
win.

Once again, W&L’s leading
scorer was Biff Martin, who put
in six goals. Aside from Mar-
tin’s play, the most pleasing
aspect of the game, from
Remillard’s point of view, was
that Indiana, a highly touted
swimming school, was unable
to ‘‘out swim”’ the Generals.

In their final game of both the
tournament and the season,
W&L defeated their biggest
water polo rival, the University
of Richmond, by a score of 14-7.
Richmond got off to an early 3-1
lead but the Generals came
back strong to take a com-
manding 7-3 halftime edge.

Unlike the last two games be-
tween these teams, W&L was
able to put together two good
halves instead of one, and they
continued to dominate until the
final gun.

The key to the defeat of Rich-
mond was, once again, W&L’s

ability to capitalize on man ad-
vantage situations. Against
Richmond, the Generals scored
on 9 of 11 of these six and five
situations.

Drew Pillsbury had six goals
to lead the offensive attack,
while Biff Martin added another
three to the W&L score. Martin
was the Generals’ leading
scorer in the tournament with
thirteen goals. The W&L
defense was led, as usual, by
the fine play of seniors Mike
Foley and Bob Newcomb.

Looking forward to next
year’s water polo season, Coach
Remillard can only lament over
the graduation of four seniors
whose play was instrumental in
the success of the team: Foley,
Martin, Pillsbury and
Newcomb. All four of these
seniors were awarded All-
Southern Conference honors
and Pillsbury was also honored
as an All-East Honorable Men-
tion recipient.

Commenting on the fine per-
formance of his first team at
W&L, Remillard had high
praise for his team, saying:
“Considering personalities, at-
titudes and talent, I will con-
sider myself very fortunate if I
ever coach another team like
this.”’

With a 20-7 record, that’s not a
difficult statement to believe.

As I See It:
Burger King
Is Back Again

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Welcome back, Burger King man — we certainly
missed you. Burger King man, otherwise known as
Rich Hachenburg, returned to Lexington last Satur-
day and threw his magical football all over the field
as the Generals rolled to a 28-20 win.

Now surely you remember B.K. He was last year’s
darling who started eight of W&L’s ten games and
won many a fan’s heart with his rah-rah, go get ’em
spirit.

Early this year, however, the Burger King was
playing more like a Burger Commoner, and Hachen-
burg soon found himself standing on the sidelines as
the Generals’ third-string quarterback.

But as the season progressed, the Generals degress-
ed. Suddenly, the Burger King was in the running
again and, in a scene seemingly straight out of
Grimm’s Fairy Tales, our hero was able to vanquish
his rivals and once again rule over the offense.

It almost seemed anti-climactic that Hachenburg
would complete 11 of 15 passes for 115 yards. But, then
again, who’s ever heard of a fairy tale without a hap-
py ending?

Realistically, of course, Hachenburg (and the en-
tire Generals’ offense for that matter) did not succeed
due to a magical football. The bearded signal-caller
was able to produce four touchdowns out of a little ex-
tra effort and a lot of old-fashioned, common sense.

Instead of playing three yards and a cloud of dust
football (although three yards and a bucket of mud
seemed more appropriate last Saturday), the
Generals came at Georgetown with a balanced run-
ning and passing attack. The Hoyas seemed so con-
fused-after W&L’s first two drives that the Generals’
predictable Power-I formation must have looked
more like a Power-Questionmark formation.

The big switch was so simple, yet so effective. In-
stead of plugging it up the middle on first down,
Hachenburg took to the air, usually finding his
receivers open on short slant-in or down and out pat-
terns. On the Generals’ first scoring drive, for exam-
ple, Hachenburg threw eight times while handing off

 

 

. eight times, covering 80 yards in over six and a half

minutes.

Hachenburg’s short passes had another effect on
Georgetown’s defense. The Hoyas’ linebackers, a
group that likes to blitz on first and second down
situations, had to play off the line, giving W&L’s run-
ning backs the unique experience of having some run-
ning room.

In these instances, Hachenburg would drop back to
pass, pushing the Georgetown linebackers deep, and
then hand off to Steward Atkinson or Lee Minetree.
Atkinson, who gained 103 yards in less than three and
a half quarters, had runs of 17 and 10 yards courtesy
of the delayed draw. And Minetree, used mostly in
short yardage situations, raced for a 71-yard
touchdown run because Georgetown was guessing
pass, instead of run, on first down.

Hachenburg was the leader of an offense that was
exciting, unpredictable and, most importantly, effec-
tive. For the first time this year, the Generals’ offense
played with the wide-openness that is the trademark
of college football. Last Saturday’s effort may have
been a bit madcap at times, but it worked.

And, as the Burger King would gladly admit, there
is something magical about that.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Kick The Habit

The American Cancer Society has proclaimed to-
day a national non-smoking day. We lend our support
to this day of common restraint from smoking
cigarettes and other forms of tobacco and urge the en-
tire university community to join with smokers
across the country in their abstinence.

Scientific studies have shown, with little room for
doubt, that smoking can lead to cancer and is
dangerous to the nation’s general health. There is
strong evidence that Americans and people living in
some of the other advanced industrial nations are
smoking less because of high taxes and health warn-
ings about the harmful effects of cigarettes.

But despite the advances of this country in kicking
the cigarette habit, the United States is manufactur-
ing more cigarettes than ever before and we are ex-
porting nearly 67 billion cigarettes — twice as many
as we exported in the early years of this decade.
Among other industrial nations, West Germany ex-
ported 24 billion cigarettes in 1977, or about four times
more than it had sent abroad six years earlier. Bri-
tain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland also showed
important export increases in the late 1970’s. The
Soviet Union and China are eager to jump in to the
cigarette export business.

In fact, world consumption of tobacco reached a
new record: 4.69 million tons last year (that’s 4.2
trillion cigarettes, 100 billion more than were smoked
in 1977). But if the industrial countries are consuming
less and exporting more, where are the increases
coming from? Japon accounts for some of the in-
crease in tobacco consumption, despite the efforts of
an antismoking drive that includes educational pro-
grams, health warnings on packages, and advertising
limits. Rapidly-developing Venezuela also has an in-
creased demand for cigarettes.

Most significantly, however, the smoking increases
have come primarily from the world’s emerging third
world countries. The industrial nations are sending
the poorer countries the cigarettes they discourage
their own citizens from smoking. The Worldwatch In-
stitute, a nonprofit research organization supported
by the Environmental Program of the United Na-
tions, describes the situation in part of the Third
World this way:

“Throughout most of Africa, venders must break
open packs and sell cigarettes one by one...In isolated
Sudanese towns, tor example, one sees young men
with annual incomes equivalent to only a few hundred
dollars buying Benson and Hedges cigarettes at 10
cents apiece.’’ In 1977, the Sudan made about 700
million cigarettes and imported an additional 900
million. Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest coun-
tries, produced 11.65 billion cigarettes in 1977, and the
pattern is similar throughout Asia and Latin
America.

The United States government is actively par-
ticipating in the moral contradiction between warn-
ing its own citizens against an American product
which is exported for other people to consume. And
cigarettes are big business, too, bringing in as much
as $66 million annually because they are exported
under the easy terms of the Food for Peace program.

As we nervously bite our fingernails today while
trying to refrain from lighting up a cigarette, we
should consider the moral implications of shipping
out dangerous products for others to consume and the
irony of making them easy to purchase under the
Food for Peace program.

Wednesday
Nights

Dear Editor:

I read with great interest
your article about the assault on
the SPE house last Wednesday
night.

Ah yes, Wednesday nights,
weren’t we just told by the
faculty last year that it was to
be a night of study? :

Yet some faculty members
saw fit to let their children loose
on the town for a night of riotous
fun at the expense of the poor,
studious SPE’s. Didn’t the
faculty’s proposal on frater-
nities cite weeknight parties as
disruptive to the academic en-
vironment at W&L?

As any Ayatollah knows, loud
music is a much more disrup-
tive force than a little harmless
violence.

Additionally, | was wondering
whether the fraternity inspec-
tion committee will be willing to

overlook this latest bit of Photographers
shameless destruction of frater-
nity property?

Obviously, the above- Illustrator

mentioned incident is no way
mitigates the well-documented
faults of the fraternity system.
Yet it does place them in an in-
teresting perspective.

different. Moreover, several
players can play at more than
one spot.

The point guard situation is
“stronger than ever,’ ac-
cording to Canfield. Captain
Pete Farrel (6’0’’) is the ob-
vious starter and is backed up
by at least two other team-
mates.

George Spears, a_ 6’0”’
sophomore, has been converted
from shooting guard fo the point
but can play either position in a
pinch. The other point guard is
Rob McDevitt, a 5’10”’
freshman, who is straight out of
the Mike Wenke mold.

The point guard position
should be the most point-
productive area on the court.
Starting there will be Carby
Hoy, a 6’1’’ junior, who could be
an All-American by the time he
graduates. Hoy was the team’s
leading scorer last season.

Backing up Hoy will be a pair
of sophomores. One of them, 6
6’2”’ Clark New, ‘“‘has to come
off the bench and score” ac-
cording to Canfield. The third
guard, Chris Schrauth, can play
either guard position but is still
recuperating from a severely

sprained ankle.

The small forward position
will also be strong, as Tom Jef-
fries, a 6’3” senior and last
year’s leading rebounder will
pe the starter. ‘“‘We’re looking
for more consistency from T.J.
this year,’’ said Canfield.

The strong forward position is
also deep. R. J. Scaggs, a 6’2”
junior who took over the posi-
tion last year, is the likely
starter. “I wouldn’t hesitate at
putting ‘“Rags’’ anywhere on
the court,’’ commented Can-
field.

Backing up Scaggs is Travis
Patterson, a 6’5’’ sophomore
who saw limited playing time
with the varsity last year. Jay
Fecktal, a 6’5”’ freshman, gives
the ‘four’ position three-man
depth.

Rob Smitherman, a 6’7”
junior, will be the starting
center.. In Canfield’s words:
“Rob has improved more than
the other players. He plays as
good a team defense as any
center I have had.”

If he gets into foul trouble,
Smitherman will be replaced by
one of three freshmen, all of
‘whom stand at least 6’6’’. Bri22
Hanson, a 6’6”’ freshman, ap-
pears to be the second center.

Three other freshmen, Rick,
Melvin, Frank Epps and Steve
Jones, will also play in the
pivot. All three players stand at
vy.

The Generals start the season
with what Canfield calls ‘‘five
tough games.” The Generals
open with Southeastern and
Bowie State, two black schools
from Washington, D.C., and
then travel to Maryville (a
team they lost to last year.)

The W&L will then play three
games at home against
Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney and
Shenandoah. The H-S game will
also serve as a good indicator of
the OCAC’s strength this year.

“Lynchburg is the conference
favorite,’ said Canfield, ‘‘but
we are the team to beat for
anyone to win the champion-
ship.’”’ Both Sydney and Lynch-
burg return All-Conference
players in Ed Owens and E.D.
Schecterly, respectively.

This preseason, Canfield has
been more demanding than
ever before. ‘I want to carry
this toughness into game situa-
tions,’’ said the coach. ‘Any
team that beats us will have to
do it by playing better. We will
not beat ourselves.”

SALT No Threat To US Security

(continued from page 1)

that conventional war poses a
more realistic threat.

Colvin said that missile
superiority has not worked as a
deterrent in the past from keep-
ing the USSR from doing
anything it wants to. Russia has
been “‘fighting wars by proxy”’
with the US even when the US
had missile superiority to the
Soviet Union; Colvin pointed to
incidents in Korea, Vietnam
and the Mid-east as examples.

Colvin said the Senate is
basically divided into four
groups on the SALT issue,
being:

The McGovern group, which
is lukewarm or hostile toward
SALT, saying it keeps the same
race going rather than stopping
i:

The Jackson group; which
says the treaty is adequate and
a step in the right direction and
that ratification is not in-
compatible with US arms build-
up and development; and

The Administation, which
feels the treaty is not all it wish-
ed but is all that is negotiable
and is a step on the road to
meaningful arms control;

The Goldwater group, which
feels any negotiations with the
Soviets are bad.

Colvin said no NATO nations
officially object to SALT, but
“total commitment of our Allies
is suspect”’ since the US is “‘the
dog of NATO and the other
countries are the tail.”’

“At every level, both civilian
and military, you have people
on both sides of the issue,”’ Col-
vin said.

In answering audience ques-
tions, Colvin said any cheating
on verification would not give
either nation a decisive edge, as
any cheating that might would

be detected by intelligence
forces. Colvin added that ac-
cusations of Soviet violations of
agreements of the Nixon and
Ford administrations have been
denied by US intelligence and
military sources.

Colvin does not feel the SALT
agreement will endanger fur-
ther development of defense
techniques, saying “‘the US has
all the alternatives it needs,”’
such as the MX system and
other proposals.

As for the question of using
SALT for leverage on other in-
ternational issues, Colvin said,
“It is childish to believe we can
deter the Soviet Union from do-
ing what it wants to do,
especially within its own
borders and in countries it con-
tols. They will not behave any

differently because Senator
Jackson says. to on the Senate
floor.”’

Several students were han-
ding out literature condemning
SALT at the lecture.

The literature was printed by
the young Americans for
Freedom. According to
member David Tyson, a
freshman at W&L, the organiza-
tion is the largest conservative
political group, with 80,000
members and supporters.

Tyson said the group is non-
partisan and purely conser-

‘vative. An essay in the pam-

phlets encouraged not ratifying
SALT as it would give the
Soviets too great a military
edge and that the Soviets and
International Communism is a
viable threat to the United
States.
