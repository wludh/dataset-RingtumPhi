EC Questions Deposit

by John Billmyre

Student Activities Board Film
Co-Chairmen, Dan Weiss and
Jose Amorin, appeared before
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night to explain problems
they have had depositing, on
time, money from the SAB
movies.

Last week EC Vice President
Les Cotter recommended Weiss
and Amorin appear before the
EC because money from the
movie “Go Tell The Spartans”
was left in the computer center.

‘It has come to our attention
that in the past you hvae had
trouble depositing the movie
money on time,”’ said EC Presi-
dent Steve Abraham, Monday.

“The money was never lost,”’
said Weiss, ‘it was merely
misplaced.”’

Proceeds from ‘Go Tell The
Spartans’ were donated to the
MD Dance Marathon.

Weiss told the EC he original-
ly went to watch the movie on
the night he left the money in
the computer center.

The film co-chairman said
when he arrived there was no
one to show the movie and he
had to be the projectionist.

After the movie, Weiss said

- he went to work on an assign-

ment in the computer center.

Weiss said he left the com-
puter room after 30 minutes to
work at the radio station on
coverage of the dance
marathon.

Dash Coufal found the money
and turned it over to someone
who works on the computers,
who in turn gave the money to
Jay Hemby, Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon Co-
Chairman.

Weiss said he finally caught
up with the money when
another dance marathon

 

 

 

worker, Tripp Brower, had it.
According to the film co-
chairman, depositing the film
money has not been a problem.
‘The money has_ been
deposited the night of the movie
most of the time,” said Weiss.
SAB Co-Chairman David Har-
pole explained the SAB
members usually pick up the
money and deposit it.
. After discussing the film com-
mittee, the EC heard a report
from the SAB about its Fancy
Dress budget and expenditures

also asked students interested
in the revision to look over the
proposed revision and attend
the next EC meeting to make
comments.

The EC is also going to accept
petitions for the positions of

Stealing Is Surprisingly High On Campus

by David Greer

At a school that professes to exist under a
system of honor, stealing occurs frequently and
the culprits are not always the nebulous
“‘townies.’’ There is good reason to believe that
students are the thieves in too many cases.

The supply store, the book store, the dining hall
and the record store are all scenes of unexplained
disappearances of goods. The gym loses equip-
ment—as much as $2,000 per year, and at the radio
station, records disappear before they are aired.

“For a school that has an honor system, the
record stealing is uncalled for,” said Robert S. de
Maria, professor of journalism and general
manager of WLUR, the university’s radio station.

De Maria says he has found WLUR records for
sale around town. Albums sometimes disappear
and then reappear. But most are gone for good.

A recent inventory found that over 400 records
disappeared over a four-year period. De Maria
says most student radio stations do not lose
records as much as WLUR. He said when he was
at Syracuse University, where the radio station
had twice the staff and the students generally
weren’t as wealthy as W&L students, the number
of records stolen was about 25 percent of the
number missing here.

Al Stewart’s “Year of the Cat”’ disappeared 10
minutes after it arrived in the studio. The ‘‘No
Nukes”’ album was stolen over Christmas break
before it could be aired.

Of 100 “‘New World Music”’ records 40 were
stolen. The series consists of native American
music such as sea chanties and folk songs.

“The people that steal abuse not only the radio
station and not only the honor system; what
they’re doing is shafting the audience,”’ de Maria
said.

De Maria said there is no problem with equip-
ment being stolen, just records. Even when the
station drilled out records so that they required
special adapters, the adapters were stolen as well.

In the dining hall a couple of coats are stolen
from the lobby each week, according to Gerald J.
Darrell, director of university dining and food ser-
vices.

Darrell says he does not see outsiders in the din-
ing hall who might steal coats and does not suspect
the employees. He pointed out that last year a stu-
dent was expelled for stealing a coat from the din-
ing hall.

Darrell says he plans to lock up the coat room so
there is only one entrance to try to cut down on the
stealing.

In the Cockpit, over 70 beer mugs disappeared
last semester. Most of them were plastic and were
not broken during use.

The Co-op has trouble with students not paying
for their food, says Darrell. It’s easy to do, he
says, because of the informal system there. Most
students, when stopped at the door, claim they
“forgot”’ to pay.

Darrell says often the same students forget fre-
quently.

“It happens more often than it should,”’ he said.

Employees at the Supply Store say legal pads,
pens, and shirts are stolen. They suspect an old
jacket found in the corner suggests someone trad-
ed jackets while in the store.

The inventory at Christmas was short $50-$75.
The employees say they have seen some stealing
but could not prove the theft or catch the thief.

They say the stealing is done by students.

And it’s “students absolutely’ who steal from
the record store, according to the store’s
manager, Adeline Goldsten.

Goldsten suspects that most of the stealing oc-
curs while she is at lunch. She loses two or three
tapes a week and five to 10 records a month.

Last year there was a problem with records be-

EC Hears SAB

(continued from page 1)
for the year. Jay Blumberg, EC
ad hoc member to the SAB, had
praise for the SAB.

‘Leaving this incident aside
(the misplaced money), I think
films are doing a good job this
year, as I understand, better
than before,’’ said Blumberg.

The EC was pleased with the
SAB budget, EC Secretary Cove
Geary said, ‘I like it.”

Geary has been instrumental
in motions dealing with presen-
tations of budgets.

After a lengthy discussion,
the EC voted 7-3 to give the
Rugby team $300. One EC
member, Edmund Schenecker,
a rugby player, abstained.

Alex Richards, speaking for
the rugby team, originally ask-
ed for $864.55, which included
money for gasoline.

‘The EC cannot fairly pay the
Rugby Club for gas when it does
not pay other clubs for gas,”
said Senior Law Representative

, John Fraser.

Other EC members echoed
Fraser’s belief.

Following more discussion,
Jay Blumberg proposed a mo-
tion the EC give the club $300.

Richards argued for more
money, but several EC
members pointed out that the

_EC could not give him more
money.

“The fact that you spent your
money wisely in the fall does
not give us the right to give you
more money,”’ Fraser said.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole called the question and
the EC voted to give the rugby
club money.

Bob Willis, Junior Represen-
tative, suggested the Rugby
club get its entire budget in the
fall next year, so it does not
have to come back for money.

Business Manager of the
Ring-tum Phi, Kevin McGowan,

gave his report on the
newspaper.

He told the EC that the Phi is
$400 in the black.

New Image
For The

Palm Parlor

by Bruce Jones

Lexington’s student popula-
tion has found a refreshing ad-
dition to its somewhat limited
range of gastronomical refuges.
The Palm Parlor, known in the
past only as an ice cream, sand-
wich and beer shop, is now, ac-
cording to owner Doug Higgins,
“a full lunch and dinner
restaurant.”

An array of appealing innova-
tions demonstrate Higgins’
assertion that he ‘“‘is making a
thrust at the student market.”

A new menu features the
traditional sandwich and ice
cream dishes and a_ large
assortment of hot, hearty
meals. Roast beef, ‘‘cooked on
the premises, not brought in
from outside,’ and homemade
soup are the specialties.

W&L student and two-year
Palm Parlor employee Brian
Leschner explained that a
newly-installed stereo system
enhances the night atmosphere
with “something more than

juke-box music.’

Numerous ‘‘College Nites’’
provide I.D.-carrying college
students with half-price sand-
wiches and draft beer at
bargain prices during Thursday

7 p.m.)

Play Review

 

by Parker Potter

Stage productions are a
tricky thing. There must be
Muses involved, or magic, or
something. After last fall’s
stunning and brilliant Hamlet,
one would have thought that no
script was too difficult for the
University Theatre to handle.

I am sorry to report that the
magic which flashed about the
stage of Hamlet is sadly miss-
ing from Lee Kahn’s production
of Tennessee Williams’ The
Glass Menagerie.

Rather than a lack of magic,
though, there are several fairly
specific ways in which the play
breaks down.

The first of these breakdowns
is John Fort’s Tom Wingfield.
Fort just doesn’t have the voice
or the presence to do the
character properly.

Tom is nobody’s hero but
Fort’s slushy delivery makes
him far less sensitive and far
less astute than he is. There is a
lot of good stuff going on in the

lines that Fort is too uncomfor-
table to deliver with any sense
of pace and timing.

As a result, much of the
strength and richness of
Williams’ language and much
of Tom’s sensitivity and insight
are lost in the shuffle.

To Fort’s credit, there are
moments when he looks the
part. In several of his dealings
with Amanda we can see Tom
listening and feeling. Trouble
is—we just can’t hear Tom.

Katherine Reiche has vocal
problems as well, but her slight-
ly clipped delivery doesn’t bad-
ly mar an otherwise fairly solid
performance.

One of Reiche’s assets is her
ability to act her Laura while

‘AAmanda’s

  

her delivery bring meaning to
each and every syllable she ut-
ters, Nothing is lost.

Further, she brings a reality
to Amanda that I’ve not seen
before. Sure gentleman callers
and planters and carriage rides
and cotillions are remnants of a
by-gone age, faded flowers
pressed in the memory book
that is Amanda.

But they did serve a purpose.
All of the props and customs of
dream’ world
were/are ways of ordering,
making sense of a large and
ever more complicated real
world.

Amanda may be off in the
clouds, but Bland shows us how
a handful of old lace can be a
pretty practical thing if it can
be used to net a gentleman
caller—a chunk of security in
an insecure world.

But for all her practicality
woven of dreams, Amanda was
crossed up by chance, by
charm, by the illogic of her
telephone man in love with long
distance. Bland plays well the
scenes where the order and
logic of unreality and the
disorder and illogic of reality
came together in Amanda’s
memories of her husband.

And indeed it is illogic which
prevails—for better or for
worse. Personifying the caprice
of the outer world is Grant
Kunkowski’s Jim, the
gentleman caller.

Kunkowski’s_ slick, high-
energy portrayal makes «the
gentleman caller just the inex-
plicable, unharnassable intru-

sion from outside that Jim is
supposed to be.

More than just a well-polished
golden boy, though, Jim is,
underneath it all, sensitive and
thoughtful. Kunkowski’s ability
to change moods and to wax
thoughtful is the play’s way of
saying that life isn’t all order
and gentleman callers.

Life is the disorder from out-
side that may fall in love with
long distance—or may just as
easily show the way to break off
an unwanted horn and survive
in a world full of horses—none
of them thoroughbreds.

Another problem is the set.
The theater-in-the-round con-
cept might be okay, but I’m not
sure. The contrast between the
ordered little world of the
Wingfield’s apartment and the
dark urban impersonality of St.
Louis beyond is shown well by
surrounding the play with the
black brick of the boiler room.

But if the stage-in-the-round
concept is on target here, the
blocking is way off base. It often
semms as if the audience isn’t
taken into account. Perhaps the
necessity of different acting
areas simply conflicts with the
round stage concept. The acting
area just isn’t well used and the
audience suffers.

Finally, though, the greatest
sin of the set is the way it
hamstrings Laura. She is hobbl-
ed by its confined area. The
limited space Rieche is given to
work in doesn’t allow Laura’s
handicap to be absorbed into
any sort of representation of the
graceful otherness Laura

The Ring-tum Phi, February 7, 1980, Page 3

Entertainment

should possess.

In all, this is not a very
coherent or controlled produc-
tion. Even though much of what
Tom says is virtually lost, the
poetry of Williams’ language
and the compelling issues of the
play aren’t unsalvagable.

But this cast and this produc-
tion are too uneven to pull off
the tight ensemble work
necessary to make a success of
this play. Our attention is too
tightly focussed on the sparcely

populated small world of the
play to tolerate even a single
misstep. And, unfortunately,
there are several here.

And while I’m at it, I have two
gripes with the business end of
this production. The lack of
publicity posters on campus
was inconsiderate, and the
seating of spectators after the
start of the play (Monday
night), especially in a theater-
in-the-round, was_ incredibly

eae.

Sports

From the Pressbox

Where Are
The Fans?

by Bill Whalen

Ken Ries, W&L’s Sports Information Director,
hates to tell lies.

Unfortunately, every time he computes the atten-
dance at a W&L home athletic event, he must resort
to lying.

Here is the reason Ken Ries has to lie about
attendance—the truth is too embarassing to admit.
The fact is: W&L has one of the least impressive at-
tendance records of most campuses around the coun-
try.

At last Saturday’s basketball game, the announced
attendance was a little over 200. My own head count
was somewhere near 175-180. You can imagine the
noise a crowd of 180 people makes in a facility which
is designed to hold 2,500.

Lalso listened to WLUR’s broadcast of the Emory &
Henry game of January 29. There were fewer than 100
fans to support the basketball team.

But this situation is not unique to the basketball
team, either.

Look at the crowd at a W&L lacrosse game. The
average attendance is somewhere between 1,500-2,000
people. The problem is that about one-third of these
spectators will take off for parts unknown (probably
Zollman’s) at halftime.

Now just imagine, for a moment, that you are a
W&L lacrosse player. The game is tied at halftime
and you glance over at Wilson Bridge and see it pack-
ed with people leaving Wilson Field like rats from a
sinking ship.

It’s a sight that no one who goes to this school should
be proud of.

One also has to feel sorry for the football team
because they suffer the same problem. It’s personally
hard for me to forget last year’s Homecoming game
against Hampden-Sydney when, with the score 7-0 at
the half, almost half the crowd went rushing for the
gates.

The attendance situation is so bad that several
coaches will refuse to make comments. One coach
has even lamented that W&L could be ‘‘the Notre
Dame of the South”’ if it could only get some honest
support.

 

 

But any support will have to come from the
students, themselves. If Hampden-Sydney can fill up
their new gym for a game against us, then why can’t
we do the same?

For some unknown reason, W&L students don’t sup-
port their teams with the same intensity that other
schools do. After all, we’re talking about college
athletics, which are life-or-death situations on other
campuses. Right now, a little of that enthusiasm
could be sorely used on this campus.

So the next time you have nothing better to do, go to
a W&L athletic event. You just might find that you
can have a good time rooting your school on to vic-
tory. And if you like it that much, you can even stay
for the second half.

Defeat At Lynchburg
Drops Generals To 8-11

Team Shoots 35.6% In 77-59 Loss

LYNCHBURG—In a_ season
already stocked with plenty of
lowpoints, the Washington and
Lee varsity basketball team
reached absolute bottom here
on Tuesday night.

Shooting 31 percent from the
floor in the second half and only
35.6 percent for the entire
game, the Generals dropped a
77-59 decision to Lynchburg Col-
lege. W&L, now 3-4 in ODAC
and 8-11 overall, is all but
eliminated from the race for the
league title. Lynchburg is 4-2 in
the conference.

“The turning point in the
game was when we showed up,”’
said a disappointed Coach
Verne Canfield. ‘We didn’t play
more than three minutes of
good ball. Just why, I don’t
know.”

Once again, the Generals
started off the game well but
eventually fell into shooting
droughts which would foil any
possibility of a comeback. Led
by the steady ball-handling of
guard George Spears, the
Generals moved into early
leads of 17-14 and 23-20.

However, W&L could not
score a basket for the next two
minutes, while two baskets
each by Lynchburg’s Scott
Mann and Joe Flynn gave the
Hornets a 28-23 lead.

It was a lead they would
never give up.

Two free-throws by Tom Jef-
feries cut the lead back to three,
but five straight Lynchburg
points put the Hornets up by
eight.

R.J. Scagg’s short jumper cut
the lead to 33-27, but Lynchburg
again rattled off five points to
go up by 11, 38-27. Rob Smither-
man’s shot at the buzzer ended
the half at 38-29, Lynchburg.

The second half looked more
like a one-on-five game, with
Jefferies providing the only of-
fense for W&L. T.J., who led all
scorers with 20 points, scored 14
of his team’s 30 second half
points.

Clark New hit a pair of free-
throws and then a long jumper
to cut the deficit to 50-39. Spears
hit one of two free-throws and a
T.J. baseline move put the
Generals at the closest they
would come, 52-42, with 7:42 re-
maining in the game.

Then, everything started to
go wrong for W&L.

Generals went scoreless. Mean-
while, Lynchburg scored eight
straight points, mostly off lay-
ups and fast-breaks, to take a

commanding 60-42 lead. The
Generals closed to within 14
twice (both times thanks to
free-throws by Frank Eppes)
but could never come closer.

For W&L, only two player:
Spears and Jefferies, shot over
50 percent from the field. With
the exception of Spears and Jef-
feries, the Generals’ starting
five hit on only six of 23 shots.
The bench could provide no
relief, as the total of sex
reserves shot a collective two
for 13.

The difierence in the game
was depth--or lack of it. Four
reserves scored for the
Generals, totalling only 10
points. The Lynchburg bench
totalled 33 points, hitting on 50
percent of its shots,

The Generals had a hard time
with their fundamentals, too.

Many of Lynchburg’s baskets
came on either lay-ups or offen-
sive rebounds. Several other
times, the Generals did not keep
a man back and Lynchburg
would score easily on quick
outlet passes.

After the game, Canfield had
no praise for his team, saying
its performance ‘‘showed no
pride.”

What particularly upset Can-
field was the fact that his team
did not stick with the original
gameplan of running a spread
offense and maintaining a slow
tempo. ‘‘We worked on our at-
tack,” said the coach, ‘‘but we
simply did not execute.”’

‘‘So many of our problems are
mental,’’ said Canfield. ‘“‘We
haven’t played together too long
and when one or two individuals
break down, so does the rest of
the team.”’

Unfortunately for the
Generals, the schedule does
work in their favor. Tonight,
they travel to Emory and Henry
College to face a team they
defeated earlier, 66-50.

Following that, W&L has
ODAC games against Bridge-
water and Eastern Mennonite
and two non-conference games
against Salisbury State and
Randolph-Macon.

The Generals’ next home
game is this Saturday against
Salisbury State. Gametime is 8
p.m. in the Warner Center.

Last week the only action the
General’s wrestling team saw
was participating in the Pem-
broke Invitational Tournament.
Once again, those wrestlers
who have been consistent win-
ners, played an important role
in gaining points for the team.

Captain Ray Gross, who
finished second and last year’s
captain, Ed Rodgers, who
finished in third place, were the
only Generals to come away
with wins.

The eight teams in the tourna-
ment did not officially keep
team points. Therefore, no
school was named the overall
winner.

Gross lost in the 142-pound
tinal, 5-3, after being seeded
first and finished the day with a
2-1 record. Rodgers also had a
2-1 mark and won his consola-
tion match, 7-1, to pick up third.

The Generals have four dual
meets before the ODAC cham-
pionships in late February. Of}
the four matches, Head Coach
Gary Franke feels the team has
a good chance at winning
against Longwood College
(which is the team’s next oppo-
nent) and Davidson.

Of the others Franke feels
that, ‘‘At the moment George
Washington has better team
strength and James Madison
will be one of the best dual meet
teams we will face all year.”’

A Stroll Around The Board

by Mike Perry

Washington and Lee’s
seventy-fourth annual Fancy
Dress Weekend, one of the na-
tion’s premier’ college
weekends, is slated for Feb. 28,
29 and 30. Although the event
has changed a great deal
throughout its long history, its
charm and character is still
best represented at the Fancy
Dress Ball. In the old days, Fan-
cy Dress was a costume ball,
participants came attired in
elaborate costumes. Today, the
seventy-five keg gala affair still
retains much of its rich historic
charm.

Each Fancy Dress is perhaps
best remembered for the
elaborate decorations
employed to depict the selected
theme. This year should prove
to be no exception. The SAB has
been working diligently to
transform Early-Fielding Stu-
dent Center into a real life

recreation of the famous
Monopoly gameboard.
Utilizing the theme of

Monopoly, SAB officials have
strained their creative genius to
produce the kind of event that
W&L students have come to ex-
pect at Fancy Dress. SAB co-
chairman David Hapole claims
that this year’s extravaganza
‘‘has the potential to be the best
Fancy Dress ever.”’

PARK PLACE

Drawn to the student center
by a searchlight, this year’s
Fancy Dress goer and his date
will present a property deed as
his admission ticket to the In-
come Tax office. Having passed
“Go,” Mr. F.D. collects $200,
(in W&L money) and procedes
around the Monopoly Board.
His first stop will be Park
Place, the center of this year’s
Ball, formerly Evans Dining
Hall. The Ballroom will be
decorated in blue and white,
Park Place’s colors and not
unknown to W&L, either. Trees,
streetlights and park benches
will be added to create a ‘‘park”’
scene, while a giant monopoly
board gazes down upon W&L
revelers enjoying the big band
sounds of Bob Crosby and his
Orchestra.

THE BOARDWALK
Leaving Park Place, Mr. F.D.
may elect to take a stroll along
the Boardwalk. The more
adventurous Fancy Dress goer
may elect to escort his date
‘under the Boardwalk,”’ to a

beach scene complete with:

lifeguard chairs, beach um-
brellas and fishnet. Rounding
out the scene and supplying
entertainment will be, who else
but Bill Pinkey and the Original
Drifters.

MARVIN’S GARDENS

Walking along a yellow color-
coded Oriental Avenue, lined
with colorful Japanese
lanterns, Mr. F.D. may procede
to Marvin Gardens. The trans-
formed Fairfax Lounge will
be decorated with trees, hang-
ing baskets and terre natural.

The garden effect will be
enhanced by the music of
Minas, a Brazillian jazz band.

RAILROAD
If Mr. F.D. needs to visit the
rest rooms at this point, he will
be happy to learn that Water
Works is located just around the

corner, near the Train Station.
The E.C. hallway will feature a
train complete with tunnel and
suitable sound effects.

JAIL
If Mr. F.D. gets out of line he
may find himself in Jail,
ironically the former E.C. head-

quarters. The Jail decor will
feature bars and metal cups
and include a mellow pro-
gressive jazz band.

STATE’S AVENUE

Mr. F.D. may elect at this
juncture to head upstairs to
State’s Avenue. Strolling down
State’s Avenue, Fancy Dress
goers will be sure to notice
posters representing all fifty
states.

CHANCE

Feeling lucky, Mr. F.D. may
venture into Chance; formerly
the T.V. Room, where he will be
entertained by Bob Dubac, a
comic-magician from Los
Angeles. Under the spell of Fan-
cy Dress, Mr. F.D. may venture
across the hall to visit two
pieces of prime Monopoly real
estate, Atlantic and Pacific,
formerly Rooms 112 and 113.
The transformed lots will
feature an arcade housing free
pinball machines, — slot
machines and other games of
chance.

Heading further down State’s
Avenue, Mr. F.D. will probably
welcome the opportunity to
duck into Room 114 for a chance
to rest his feet and catch a
variety of cartoons or film
shorts.

TICKET INFORMATION

Tickets are scheduled to go on
sale next Wednesday, Feb. 20,
at 12:00 in the Student Center.
The charge is $15.00. Grain cups
and souvenir posters have been
ordered in greater quantities
than last year in an attempt to
avoid shortages and will be
available Monday, Feb. 24:

Depression Didn’t Dampen Fancy Dress

by John Wells

January, 1930, was separated
from the stock market crash by
less than three months, and the
effects of the Great Depression
had not yet reached Lexington.
Huge ads in the Ring-tum Phi
urged students to smoke
Chesterfields, patronize Mc-
Crum’s and flock to see the cur-
rent picure at the New Theater,
Hot in Paris. While it is uncer-
tain (though doubtful) that the
advent of Hard Times
restricted leisure activities for
students in general, it does not
appear that any visible
economies were imposed upon
the Fancy Dress Ball of 1930, fif-
ty years ago.

On January 8th of that year,
the Ring-tum Phi reported in
headlines: “Fancy Dress Plans

Indicate That Affair Will Sur-
pass All’ and “Elaborate
Scheme is Prospect In
Transforming Doremus Gym-
nasium.”’ The projected theme
was “A Spanish Fiesta in Old
Valencia’ representing ‘“‘the
eveing prior to a_bullfight
climaxing the fiesta given by
the King and Queen in honor or
their heir to the throne.’’ Once
again in charge of the ‘famed
spectacle’”’ was W&L professor
C.E.L. Gill, also a 1922
graduate. Prof. Gill was famous
for staging elaborately
thematic balls and 1930 was no
exception. The newspaper
reported: ‘‘For the first time,
specially designed scenery will
be used in addition to the usual
decorations. Workmen have
been busy for the past month

constructing sets to be used in
the gymnasium.” Prof. Gill
reportedly gathered ideas and
materials for the dance from an
extended Spanish tour he had
taken the previous summer.

The paper rather stuffily an-
nounced: “Because of the gala
occasion, the decorations will
carry out a festive air.’’ The
gym was transformed into a
courtyard with buildings facing
an open square. Readers were
assured the dance would be
alive with color, using exten-
sively red, pink, yellow, blue,
green and lavendar.

By January Lith,
measurements had been taken
for the costumes. It was an-
nounced that Jean Goldkette’s
famous Victor recording or-
chestra had been secured to

supply the music. The group
boasted the fact that it was the:
original Casa Loma orchestra ’
which had its origins at the New
York cabaret of the same name.
Prior credits under the band’s
belt included the Great Yuletide
Ball in Brooklyn, Finals at
Princeton, and the National
Electric Railway Convention in
Atlantic City.

Fancy Dress weekend at that

‘time occurred during a brief

break between the first and se-
cond semesters, a period cram-
med with social events. The
Junior Prom was held the even-
ing prior to the ball. On January
3ist “‘dasants’’ were given at
SAE from 11:30 until 2:00 p.m.,
and at Alpha Tau Omega from

See 1930, p. 6
Page 6, The Ring-tum Phi, February 7, 1980

Fancy Dress 1930

2:30 until 5:00 p.m,, both ac-
companied by Jean Goldkette’s
famous Victor recording or-
chestra. That evening, follow-
ing the gala occasion itself,
W&L seniors were invited to a
hop at neighboring VMI (this is
an old newspaper). The next
day Phi Epsilon Pi offered the
Southern Collegians at a dance
from 9-12 a.m. which hard core
rug cutters could hit only after
attending a similar event at KA
from 3-5 that afternoon. Of the
latter event it was advertized:
“Locklayer’s Virginians, a col-
ored orchestra from Roanoke,
will furnish the syncopation.”’

‘PHANTASMORIA’

The ball itself went off
without a hitch, and the follow-
ing day the Ring-tum Phi pro-
claimed it ‘“‘One of the Most
Brilliant Affairs in the History
of the Ball.’’ The paper reported
that students and their dates
glided ‘‘amid a phantasmagoria
of color” (one at first wonders
how many survived that
ordeal). The reporter, who
wisely remained nameless, was

probably aided by Prof. Gill
when he went on to identify the
characters that the dancers’
costumes represented: ‘El
Cids, Don Juans of Austria,
Isabels, Matadors, toreadors,
picadors, and Don Juan
Tenorios’’ were joined by ‘“‘Gyp-
sies from Andalusia, Flamenco
dancers, Infanatas, Goyescas,

 

  

segovians, Jota dancers,”’ and
even ‘‘street-singing Penitents
from Holy Week in Seville.”’

TANGO

W. Van Gilbert, the student
who was in charge of the ac-
tivities, led the figure with his
date, Miss Bebe Saunders of
Athens, Alabama. (A
photograph of Miss Saunders,
slightly reminiscent of Zelda
Fitzgerald, adorned the front

page of the Ring-tum Phi.) The
highlight of the evening came, it
was reported, when “Miss
Mildred Peirce of Birmingham,
Ala., danced a tango with
Thomas Smith of Havana,
Cuba.”

It is doubltful that this year’s
Fancy Dress will be as
elaborately staged as it was fif-
ty years ago. Over the years the
nature of entertainment has
changed, from contemporary
tastes reflected by selection of
the Casa Loma band during the

Latin American craze of that
period, to the more traditional
sounds of the Lester Lanin
crowd. Whatever the theme is
this year, it is sincerely hoped
that newspaper accounts won’t
reach the level of pomposity as
recorded in 1930.”

Fancy Dress Ball

 

Crosby To Supply Swing

by Mark Kinniburg

Bob Crosby and his orchestra will be performing
as the major dance band in the Evans Dining Hall
this Fancy Dress. One does not need to tax the
memory too much to realize that Bob Crosby is the
younger brother of Bing Crosby, the great crooner
who passed away recently. Bob, like his brother,
also has had a very big stage career—from his
beginnings as an amateur singer in an orchestra
at 15 years of age to his famous shows of today.

Zany Career

Along with Bob’s long career, there are many
zany events which are recorded in his semi-
official biography of the same title. There was that
time when the orchestra played five introductions
in a row, and poor little Bob couldn’t even utter a
sound, Another slap-happy antic was when Bob
showed up an hour late to an audition with the An-
son Weeks Orchestra because he had forgotten his
suspenders. So, in front of all those listening, Bob
held up his pants while singing! How silly he must
have looked holding on for dear life to his pants!

There are many interludes in the career of Bob
Crosby where he can be found with the names of
the day. Bob was the first male vocalist in the
Dorsey Brothers Orchestra and. began his recor-
ding career with them on the Decca and
Brunswich labels. The ‘‘big break”’ for Bob Crosby
came in 1935 when Ben Pollack had decided to
leave his orchestra, and the musicians he had
fronted wanted to stay together as a band.
Needing a front man to be the personality of the
band, they contacted Bob to help them out.

Bob Crosby took the band on one-nighters across .

the country playing a peculiar blend of Dixieland
Jazz which became known as Dixieland Swing.
From this early 1936 tour of the United States also
came the now classic ‘‘South Rampart Street’’—
which surely brought down the house at the Lex-
ington Hotel in New York City. (Note: the Lex-
ington Hotel was to have few bands after Bob
Crosby’s because it was obliterated by lightning in
the Great Storm of 1937.)

From September 1936 on, Bob Crosby and his
Bobcats were the talk of the popular band set. The

competition between brother Bing began to sub-
side as Bob’s, not Bing’s, face was on the cover of
Downbeat Magazine. By 1938 he had been voted
the youngost Grade A bandleader of his time. In
1938, Downbeat named the Bob Crosby Orchestra
the Best All-American Jazz Band in the land.
Bob’s unequaled legacy likens surely his inherent
talent.

Not only did Bob Crosby win fame for himself
and the Bobcats, he helped many girl singers
become famous. In fact, Doris Day, Kay Starr and
Gloria De Haven are still stars today. Gradually,
the Bob Crosby Orchestra progressed to a weekly
radio show on NBC and subsequent record deals.
Getting more and more exposure to the American
people was no problem for the Bobcats, as they
were chosen for film roles by Paramount and
Republic. Entering films on his own, Bob Crosby
acted in the great MGM films. ‘‘The Singing
Sheriff’’ and “‘See Here Private Hargrove’ with
such fine actresses as Judy Canova and Joan
Davis. Requests for Bob as an actor were more
than rivaling his musical career, but both were
put on ice for World War II.

USO Entertainer

In May of 1944, Bob enlisted in the Marine Corps
to fight in the Fifth Marine Division combat unit.
He was quickly transferred to the Headquarters,
however, and ordered to form a whole show of
Marine entertainers. This Marine show was sent
to the combat areas where regular U.S.O. shows
weren’t allowed because of dangerous conditions.
He was honorably discharged from the Marine
Corps with a Lieutenant’s commission in
December 1946.

Bob Crosby is married to his wife of 42 years,
June, and together they have five children.
Besides this family connection, though, Bob main-
tains close ties with his music friends in the
business. As a closing quote, Bob relates, ‘My
Bobcats played it 15 years ago in a night club were
the lights were so dim we couldn’t read the
music...so what’s all the excitement about?” Well,
Bob, that’s rock ’n roll for you! !

Thursday Night

 

Pavillion Party

 

Pavillion Bands

Brice Street And Fat Ammon’s

by Robin Meredith

This year’s traditional pre-Fancy Dress, Thurs-
day night concert has been moved from the gym
out to the Pavillion for logistic reasons, and conse-
quently has been scaled down just a bit out of
necessity. But whatever you do, don’t despair; the
SAB has put together such a solid line-up of bands
that this BYOB party, beginning around 8 p.m.,
Feb. 28, promises to be just as good, if not better,
than those held in previous years.

The Brice Street Band will kick things off that
evening, featuring their spirited mix of
mainstream rock 'n roll and Southern funk.
Although they concentrate mostly on covers of
material by established artists, Brice Street is not
your typical bar band by a long shot. Indeed, any
group whose repertoire includes songs by such a
diverse bunch as Jean-Luc Ponty, The Band,
Chick Corea, and The Beach Boys can hardly be
said to be typical of anything!!! Not only are they
versatile, they’re just plain good; after a few

The Fat Ammon’s Band

 

 

 

beers, you just might have a little trouble telling
their versions from the originals!

Thursday night’s headliners, returning to Lex-
ington after a relatively lengthy absence, are pro-
bably among the best and classiest acts going in
the Southeast today. Everything you need to know
about Fat Ammon’s Band can be summed up in
one word: professional. Their lighting and sound
are first-rate and, like Brice Steet, they’re a lot
more than just your run-of-the-mill cover band.
After warming you up a bit with their polished,
disco-soul stylings, Ammon’s invariably closes out
the evening (and brings down the house) with a
fast-paced, witty, entertaining floor show that
should work like gangbusters in the intimate at-
mosphere of the Pavillion.

Sound good??? Well, the price of admission is in-
cluded in the cost of your Fancy Dress ticket, so
don’t forget to BYOB out to the Pavillion Thurs-
day, Feb. 28, around 8 p.m. and get your F.D. 1980
off to a strong start.

Freshman Class Present

 

Rock, Country, Juke... Vodka |

by Pryse Elam

Having taken a stroll around
the board on Friday night, the
Fancy Dress Weekend con-
tinues on Saturday afternoon
with the Freshman Class Grain
Party, which should be no less
spectacular. It will begin at 1:00
p.m. on Saturday afternoon and
draw to a close at 6:00. The par-
ty is put on each year by the
Freshman Class and according
to this year’s Class President,
Jim Averett, “It should be a
really great party!” Featuring
three bands, the goal of the par-
ty is to satisfy everyone’s
taste.‘‘I got three bands, rock,
country, and juke to give
everyone a taste of what they
want.”’ With three bands and
unlimited alcohol this should
prove to be one of the best par-
ties of the year.

Unfortunately, the energy
crisis has struck deep into the

Grain Party 1979

heart of this year’s party by
steering the use of grain alcohol
away from humans _ to
automobiles as gasohol. Lucki-
ly, Averett has averted this
crisis by switching to an alter-
nate form of fuel, vodka. ‘‘I ex-
plored a number of grain
possibilities, but found them to
be unreliable. Rather than risk-
ing it with one of them, I decid-
ed to get vodka. It is certain,
and it is cheaper, so I can get
more.’’ Averett says that the
vodka will be mixed strong
enough with orange juice and
punch to produce the desired ef-
re

The first band to play will be
‘“‘Tracks,” a wide-range rock
band blending everything from
New-Wave to Rock and Jazz. In-
cluded in their repertoire are
songs by such known artists as:
Elvis Costello, The Cars, The
Beatles, Billy Joel, and Steely

the W&L Campus at the
Muscular Distrophy Dance |
Marathon where their per- |
formance was heralded as one_ |
of the best at W&L in years. |

The next band to play will be |
“‘Nobody’s Real,” a blend of |
country and _ bluegrass. |
Nobody’s Real has played up
and down the East Coast and is
described as one of the best.
Their repertoire includes songs
from: Little Feat, Bob Dylan,
Pure Prairie League, and the
Marshall Tucker Band. This
band should provide excellent
entertainment as the afternoon
continues.

Highlighting the afternoon
will be the “Grandeurs,’”’ an
energetic band blending soul,
beach, and disco. This band
having been introduced at
Princeton University in 1978 has
quickly become a_ favorite
among East-Coast colleges.
They will be playing music by
such famous artists as: the O’-
Jays, Spinners, and Bee-Gees.
This band should complete the
afternoon and polish it to a shin-

Golden Coach Screening Honors Renoir

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will screen as its second
movie of the winter term the
legendary film The Golden
Coach (France Italy, 1952) by
the great French director Jean
Renoir. Screenings will take
place on Friday and Saturday,
February 8 and 9, in classroom
“A” of Lewis Hall, free of
charge. This rarely seen film is
being shown in honor of Renoir,
who died last year, and who
was, in my judgment, in the
richness of his sensibility, the
greatest director in the history
of cinema.

Two of Renoir’s best known
works, the war film Grand Illu-
sion (1937) and The Rules of the
Game (1939), appear  con-
sistently on critics’ lists of the
ten best films of all time.
(These are often shown here in
Professor Jennings’ Tuesday
night movie series, which is

open to the public.) Jean Renoir
was the son of the Impressionist
painter Auguste Renoir, and
shared the Impressionists’ con-
cern with the relation between
art and our ideas of reality. The
Rules of the Game, which takes
as its subject the French ruling
classes on the eve of World War
II, offers a beautifully complex
meditation on the value of
civilization and civilized life. It
explores the damage that
civilized society does to nature
and the ‘‘natural self,’’ and at
the same time reveals the
richness of the civilized self.

The Golden Coach concerns
the loves of a beautiful Italian
actress in a commedia dell’ arte
troupe traveling through Peru
in the 18th century. Commedia
dell’ arte is a popular art form
that dates back to 16th century
Italy. It weds the artificialities
of early Italian drama to more
popular forms of

entertainment—satiric ‘songs,
dancing, and farces. It is of
great historical importance to
the development of the theater
also because it admitted women
to the stage. Employing im-
provised dialogue and masked
characters, it gave rise to the
traditional characters of pan-
tomime: Harlequin, Clown,
Pantaloon, Scaramouche, and
Columbine.

The film suggests that art and
reality, or civilization and
nature, can be synergistic as
well as antagonistic) and that

what we call the ‘‘natural self”’
may be not only immeasurably
enriched, but actually made
more natural, more alive, more
itself through the imagination
and the civilized world of art
and artifice. Renoir’s distinc-
tion is in the number of tensions
and seeming contradictions he
can feel and hold in balance, in
his unparallelled ability to
grant life its full complexity.

Electric Horseman: Comic Throwbac

by Paul Hendry

They don’t make movies like
they used to? Well, they do, and
one of them is currently at Lex-
ington’s Lyric—The Electric
Horseman. In fact, The Electric
Horseman so outshines the
other recently released com-
edies that it is provocation for a
careful examination of trade
trends.

The film is an atavism, a
throwback to the screwball
comedies of the thirties and
simpler times. It greatly
resembles many films of the
‘screwball’ genre, but most
noticeably It Happened One
Night starring Clark Gable and
Claudette Colbert.

In Electric Horseman the
roles have been reversed: the
runaway heiress becomes run-
away media-celebrity cowboy;
and the calculating _ in-
vestigative reporter who starts
out after the big story and winds
up in love is changed from
Gable to Jane Fonda.

Robert Redford is the ‘‘Elec-
tric Horseman’’—a former
rodeo world champion who has
bowed to the dollar and taken to
selling breakfast cereal for a
conglomerate.

A fish out of water in the high
powered advertising, media-
orientated world, Redford con-
scientiously hijacks the cor-
porate symbol, a_ valuable
thoroughbred horse who is
abused by the bad guys of big
business.

The rash action of the proud
man humiliatingly reduced to a
pitchman clad in a ridiculous
electrically lighted cowboy suit
inspires roving reporter Jane
Fonda to cooly follow the out-
cast’s fight for pride, fairness,
and that which is morally right.

The plot follows along these
simple lines to an inevitable
conclusion. Good old-fashioned
entertainment.

There is something essential
to the plot that is not old-
fashioned, however, and that is
the love interest at the core of
the story. The screen relation-
ship between Redford and Fon-
da is enjoyable in its clash of
personalities and sharp ex-
changes, but it fails to be com-
pletely convincing with respect
to their tempestuous love affair.
It seems obvious that the cow-
boy prefers his horse (who he

does kiss at the movies end) to .

Fonda, to whom he only directs
a few winsome gazes and occa-
sionally beds down.

The potential for a serious
and sensitive union of the two is
trashed for a couple of tosses in
the hay. This is a failing of
script writer and director and
not the actors.

Redford and Fonda are both
very adept at creating
believable personages, and if
one can forgive Fonda her
demonstrative public image it
is possible to enjoy her rare
talents. She is the quintessential
stuck-up city professional

woman and her conflict with the
country-wise Redford is classic.

There are also notable sup-
porting performances by
Valerie Perrine as the cowboy’s
ex-wife and by Willie Nelson as
Redford’s best friend.

The second half of the film
lulls itself into a pretentious
lyrical folk ballad’ with
beautifully photographed
panoramas of the West, ap-
propriately scored. Without the
earlier tension between the
characters and without insur-
mountable obstacles for the
heroes to overcome, the film
does drag.

The long awaited climax ends
the drawn out picturesque in-
terlude with its ‘‘profound”
developments.

Where is the comedy? Red-
ford and Fonda are not off
Saturday Night Live and have
no comedy albums. They don’t
even have a T.V. series of their
own.

What is funny in the film—
and it is very funny—comes out
of the skillful exchange be-
tween two outstanding actors
working off of an intelligent and
provoking script.

The Electric Horseman is a
Versatile film that strikes at
more than the funny bone. It is a
success, too.

Movies like Spielberg’s 1941
and Reiner’s The Jerk are
significant failures although
they boast the comic talents of
such standouts as John Belushi;

Dan Aykroyd, Slim Pickens and
Steve Martin. They fail in an ef-
fort for a continuous laugh.
Mindless slapstick, due to its
essential elements of quick sur-
prise and explosiveness, does
not lend itself to long sustained
forms, but rather to short sket-
ches.

The Electric Horseman,
while trotting at too slow a pace
at times, has moments of genu-
ine humor that are produced by
believable screen characters. It
is in these moments that Elec-
tric Horseman takes off at a full
gallop that leaves the likes of
1941 and The Jerk in its dust.

 

Film Notes

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), George
Roy Hill’s buoyant western, has many memorable
moments for everyone, and the initial teaming of
Paul Newman and Robert Redford nailed the coffin
shut on the so-called ‘“‘woman’s picture” for years.
William Goldman’s script is well paced and effective-
ly carried out by the principle players and the
beautiful Katherine Ross. The film is remarkable for
its sharp contrast to the harsher, more violent films
which characterized the period. The Bachrach-David
score (especially ‘‘Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My
Head’’) dates it slightly.

Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979), an ill-
advised ‘‘prequel”’, made nearly ten years after the
fact, which didn’t sell. Director Richard Lester is at
least consistant: this was his fourth flop in as many
years. The title provides a wonderful summary of the
plot of this critical and commercial dog. With Tom
Berringer and William Katt who, Rona Barrett
hooted a few years ago, would be our next Clark
Gable. Sure, Rona.

Note: The most recent of the two films will be shown
at 7 p.m. in Dupont auditorium, Feb. 8-10. A separate
admission ($1) will be charged for each.

WLUR, Gym Hardest Hit

(continued from page 1)

ing stolen at night—$400 worth of records were
stolen in night thefts in one month. Managers at-
tribute the thefts to students. More doors being
locked at night (while the Co-op is open) has
eliminated the problem, Goldsten said.

There is some problem with “slippage” in the
textbook department of the book store, according
to manager Betty Munger. Slippage is the term for
“‘unaccounted-for disappearances.”

She has locked up the back door to stop some of
the thefts. Munger says she really cannot estimate
the losses or where they occur because the book-
store runs on a deficit and records of specific book
sales are not kept.

“The only thing I can count on is the rapport
with the students,”’ she said.

The main problem in the gymnasium is the
disappearance of towels, said Chub Yeakel, the
supervisor of the equipment.

About 600 towels were stolen last year, he said.
They usually are taken while nobody is at the
equipment room window.

Balls are often checked out and not returned on
time, but they eventually get back to the equip-
ment room, he said. Squash and handballs are
broken, he suspects, and says he would appreciate
students bringing the broken ones back so they
can be accounted for.

Practice equipment is stolen, especially gym
shorts and shirts. Yeakel says he loses more than
$500 a year on that equipment. Much of it is
reported stolen from the students it was issued to,

he said. He suspects much of that stealing is done
by the students.

As for stealing in the dormitories, ‘‘there’s a lot
of it,’ says Head Dorm Counselor Danny Carucci.

Most of the thefts occur on the first floor, he
said, and there have been reports of ‘‘townies’’ in
the building. Often, he says, a student reports as
stolen something he has lost or misplaced.

Hall refrigerators are frequent targets, he said.
Beer is often taken, sometimes as much as a case
ata time.

Are students doing any of the stealing? “Only a
few, who need to be caught,” said Carucci.

The book loss rate in the library is about 112
percent, according to head librarian Maurice
Leach.

While this is a low loss rate, says Leach, the
department libraries have a loss rate of 6 percent.
A rate above five percent is cause for concern, he
said.

Leach said that 30 to 50 books appear in student
apartments over the summer and when new rent-
ers move in in September.

There is also the problem with books that are not
checked out, as sometimes the library needs to
retrieve the book and there is no record of its
whereabouts.

Some types of books tend to disappear and reap-
pear more than others, especially those in ‘‘cer-
tain humanities’’ departments, said Leach.

As for items stolen from the carrels, Leach said,
“The student body would be wise not to leave
anything of obvious monetary value in the car-
rels.”’

Applications For
Admission Up

Applications for admission to
Washington and Lee University
are up 46 percent this winter
over the number at the same
point a year ago, admissions of-
ficials reported today.

As of Jan. 30—with two more
weeks to go before the 1980 ap-
plication deadline—W&L had
received 1,012 applications
from prospective freshmen.

The Jan. 30 figure is the
highest in many years and
points to the probability that
more than 1,400 applications
will be processed in all, ac-
cording to admissions director
William M. Hartog.

The total is likely to be the
second-highest Washington and
Lee has ever received, he said.

Beyond numbers, according
to Hartog, the quality of
students who are applying to
Washington and Lee this year is
higher both by statistical
measures of achievement and
in terms of personal records.

The mean College Board
scores for the 1,012 students
who have applied so far this
year are up 10 points from last
year’s average. .

Twelve -National Merit
Scholarship competition final-

ists have named W&L their first
choice among all colleges, Har-
tog said—against four on the
same date a year ago.

On the basis of the 1,000-plus
applications received so far,
Hartog said, the overall quality
at the top of the group is so
superior that Washington and
Lee has already doubled the
number of acceptances it has
sent out under its ‘‘clearly ad-
missible”’ criteria to 200 as of
Jan. 30 this year. The figure a
year ago was 100.

The ‘‘clearly admissible”
category refers to applicants
whose records are so outstand-
ing that they can be offered ad-
mission without waiting to be
compared against the entire
group of applicants.

Of those 200 who have already
been accepted by W&L, 65 per-
cent are in the top tenth of their
secondary-school classes.

Only once in the past decade
has W&L received a total of
more than 1,400 applications—
in 1973, with 1,412.

The Jan. 30 application
figures for recent years were
694 a year ago, 544 two years
ago, and 928 in 1977.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Letters To The Editor

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Hazing

The time of initiation is upon us, when all good
pledges make the passage from goat to brother into
the fraternity of their choice. Here a fraternity’s
traditions manifest themselves, often to the detri-
ment of the pledge but for the general amusement of-
the brethren. Hazing practices have been around
since the stone age, but we are no longer in the stone
age and nobody can seriously believe that a pledge
will not become a man if he does not do obscene things
with olives.

The administration and the IFC is cracking down on
hazing. Some houses have been caught, others are be-
ing careful, many are modifying their activities. One
of the houses formerly associated with a rigorous Hell
Night voted as a chapter just to simply abolish all haz-
ing, cold turkey. The logic was that although they
might get away with some things this year, or even
pull the whole thing off, eventually they will get
caught and the penalties are too stiff totake the risk of
getting caught.

All fraternities could take a similar action and not
suffer any loss of ‘‘pledge unity” or whatever excuse
is used. Hazing is propagated by peer pressure; when
the peers all agree and the pressure is removed, the
fraternities will be surprised to see how little is miss-
ed. And nobody can logically buy the old line, ‘“They
did it to me, so the pledges should have to do it, too.”’

We have all heard the horror stories about hazing
incidents that end in tragedy. Many of the hazing ac-
tivities that occur on this campus may be safe when-
practiced as intended, but it is too easy for something
to go wrong. The dangers of exposure and especially
alcohol poisoning are underestimated but very real.

Consider the risks your fraterntiy takes by engag-
ing in hazing practices, ‘‘voluntary”’ or not. Besides
the risk of harming a pledge there is the very real risk
of stiff punishment by the IFC, punishment that
seems worse with the approach of Fancy Dress. The
IFC is hitting fraternities for what may seem trivial
infractions, things the pledges enjoy and cause no
harm to anyone, but the punishments are being hand-
ed out and enforced. SAC does not see the harmless-
ness of many incidents, and is seldom amused.

We do not suggest that all Initations should stick to
the hocus-pocus in the secret book. The activities do
not have to benefit the community or the house. They
can still be enjoyed by all and will probably be more
memorable. Will it matter in five years that you had
to drink molasses and Tabasco in order to learn a
secret handshake?

Admission Price At Sweet Briar

Dear Editor,

The following letter was received by The Sweet
Briar News, and in turn given to me. As the chair-
man of the Social Committee I believe I can
clarify any misunderstandings about our admis-
sion/cover charge policies. This letter and reply
will also appear in the next issue of The Sweet

Briar News.

Dear Editor,

I am a student at Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, and for my own Satisfaction, I would like to
know why you charge admission at your social
functions. This has puzzled me for quite some time
because I feel that this policy is unjustifiable.

The girls from your school attend our fraternity
parties here in Lexington, and we supply the beer,
grain alcohol, etc. The only cost deferred upon the
girls is the price of the gas over here.

Not only do the fraternities sponsor FREE par-
ties, but the school itself does also. The Student
Activities Board sponsors many parties and bands
When there is a cover

throughout the year.
charge, it is paid by everyone.

It seems only natural that your school would
reciprocate. We drive over—the price of gas isn’t
exactly cheap—and once we get there, we are
charged for admission as well as for beer. Is this
considerate behavior? What’s wrong, girls? Spen-
ding all your money on makeup and clothes?

In this day and age of ‘‘Women’s Lib,” have you
not—figuratively speaking—have you not stooped
” charging your men for

to a level of ‘‘prostitution :
your female companionship?

Sincerely yours,

First, there is obviously a misunderstanding con-
cerning our admission/cover charge policy. Sweet
Briar students are neither given free admission
nor any special rates to events where our guests
are asked to pay a fee. EVERYONE (both boys
and girls) is charged the same amount.

Secondly, Social Committee is run on a very
tight budget, about one-third of our budget is spent
on parties. Our budget also includes the movies

which are shown almost every Saturday night (25
cents admission),
wine and cheese parties, playreadings, and guest
theater productions. Thus the revenue from a par-
ty must cover the costs of the band, the beer, a
professional cleaning crew, security, and any
DAMAGES done to the campus (the latter cost be-
ing very unpredictable). Since I do not know how

coffeehouse entertainment,

the budgets of the Student Activities Board or the

individual fraternities are organized, it would be
presumptuous for me to comment on their admis-
sion/cover charge policies.

Thirdly, Sweet Briar usually charges one all-

inclusive admission price. The most recent party

a beer,”’

on the 19th of January was the first time we have
ever charged two fees (admission and beer). The
flyers plainly stated ‘‘$2.00 admission and 25 cents
thus the charges should not have been a
shock once one reached the party.

I trust this has answered Mr. Leachman’s ques-
tions and clarified our admission/cover charge
policies. Thank you for the opportunity to explain
Sweet Briar’s admission/cover charge policies

and to correct any misunderstandings concerning

them.

In response to Mr. Leachman’s letter to the
editor, I believe I can solve the ‘‘puzzle’’ as to why
we “charge admission to our social functions.”’

War Fever And Torn Down Posters

Dear Editor,

In response to the war fever
that seems to be gripping our
country and to the recent
clamor for the reinstitution of
conscription we, as a group of
alarmed and concerned
students, wanted to express our
opposition to this growing way
hysteria.

We chose to do this by putting
up a series of posters around
campus that had anti-war and
anti-draft slogans emblazoned
on them. While we did not ex-
pect that all members of the
W&L community would agree
with us we did expect that our
right to express ourselves free-

The Error Of Our Ways

I thank the heavens that I have seen the error of ability to make decisions as either groups or in-

my ways.

For several years, I was under the absurd
assumption that I bore sole responsibility for my
actions. I believed that I was capable of deciding
when, and to what extent, I would pursue the in-
tellectual studies assigned to me by my betters. I
even believed that the consequences of ignoring

ly would be respected.

Unfortunately this was not
the case. Within three hours of
the time that the posters went
up 95 percent of them had been
ripped down. We had expected
that some individuals would
find our message offensive and
that there would be sporadic
and isolated attempts to censor
us but we were apalled to en-
counter a seemingly systematic
effort by self-appointed censors
to silence us.

We are disappointed by this
show of intolerance but one of
our main hopes in initiating this
poster campaign may yet be
realized. This was the desire to
open a dialogue in the W&L
community on the disturbing

dividuals.

Sincerely,

Ann T. Rockwell

Chairman, Social Committee
Sweet Briar College

implications that recent events,
both foreign and domestic, have
for all Americans.

To this end we call upon all
those who found our message
offensive enough to warrant
censorship to come forward and
publicly defend their actions.
We also call on all members of
the W&L community to par-
ticipate, publicly or privately,
in a re-examination of those
ideas that have brought us so
perilously to military confron-
tation.

Finally, any member of the
W&L community who wishes to
lend us their support, moral or
otherwise, is invited to contact
us at 463-9752.

Sincerely,

Obviously, because these great men have said
so, the present level of unfavorable grades is not
enough of a deterrent to keep students away from
those social activities that have been demmed so
repugnant. Yet, to increase the number of op-
portunities for unfavorable grades would be to un-

justly require these great discerners of truth to
spend more time away from the quiet contempla-
tion that their superiority deserves and requires.
Therefore, I beg the student body to grant the fiats
of these hallowed men their unqualified support,
as Ihave.

Throw away your recordings of ‘bar music.”
Do not participate in mid-week festivities as
groups. Recognize and ignore the transitory temp-
tations of the opposite sex. Help raise the level of
professors, salaries. Do homage to the past while
remaining blind to the present. In short, dedicate
yourself to the will and whims of those who believe
they possess the true basis of judgment and who
are willing to impose it on anyone who disagrees.

my studies (i.e. bad grades) would be enough to
spur me on in even those fields where sweet
apathy seemed to cloud my judgment.

Ahh, but I was mistaken.

Those members of the faculty that have ap-
pointed themselves philosopher-kings have shown
me the folly of my past beliefs. As the possessors
of the highest wisdom and virtue, they, and cer-
tainly not any students, should determine the form
and limits of this institution’s social experiences.

With their heightened insight, these philosopher-
king-professors have seen that we are incapable of
governing ourselves. As lesser beings, it is only
correct that we bend to their will and renounce our

Faculty Movement To Undermine The UC

To the Editor:

A number of alarming topics are currently be-
ing debated by certain factions within the
Washington and Lee community. Specifically,
these are the removal of policy-making authority
from the University Council, and the prohibition of
all weeknight fraternity parties.

The University Council was established ‘“‘by
faculty action on December 7, 1970, and among its
specific responsibilities was to exercise delegated
authority.”” This authority was delegated on April
1, 1974 by further faculty action—the University
Council was henceforth to develop policy for stu-
dent conduct.

The University Council is composed of admini-
strators, faculty, and students. It has, in recent
years, proven to be rational and judicious in the
performance of its duties. It is a well-balanced
representative body, and to remove the UC from
any effective role on this campus would be a
heinous crime because the UC has emerged as the
only forum where all views are represented and
can be heard. In essence, this is the only body (ex-
cluding the student body EC) where we have a
fighting chance to affect the policies which control
us.

Faculty discussion to remove the policy-making
capability of the UC has surfaced in response to
recent decisions of this committee. This move-
ment appears to be little more than spoiled
children throwing a tantrum because they did not
get their way.

Although the faculty gave the UC its authority
and can just as easily remove it, I believe that it
would be a grievous error to do so.

No More Restrictions

The fraternity situation has drastically changed
since my freshman year. The mere suggestion of
further prohibitions of weeknight fraternity par-
ties is disturbing, to say the least. A compromise
of opinions appears to have been reached. The
fraternities are settling into the current state of af-
fairs with regard to weeknight parties, and addi-
tional restrictions in this area should not be ac-
cepted. The fraternities at W&L are the most
cohesive interest group, and if they were to form a
unified front, their voice would be_ heard.
However, this is not the crux of the situation.

The faculty’s action is like the scatter pattern of
a shotgun shell—the faculty has not aimed on the
central issue but is hitting around it. The in-
dividual student should be the focus of the facul-
ty’s concern. The Student Affairs Committee
made this point clear in its report on the Relation-
ship between Academic and Fraternity Life:
‘*’.._Individual students, not organizations, bear
the responsibility for that student’s grades.”’

If Washington and Lee is to retain its emphasis
on liberal arts then the faculty should realize that
part of this education is the ability to set one’s
priorities. If one chooses to party seven nights a
week, the faculty has within its powers the ability
to teach the student where he may possibly be
wrong in his conduct. We came to W&L to receive

_an education, not to be wound up like robots.

The faculty can control our academic lives, but
outside of the classroom we are free to live as we
please—including our social lives.

Response To The Motion To Ban Bands

Thanks For
Editorial

Dear Editor,

Thank you for your editorial
“On Banning Bands,”’ in which
you exposed IFC President Syd
Farrar’s position, or lack
thereof, concerning live bands
at mid-week fraternity parties.

If your allegations are true, it
is obvious that Mr. Farrar’s
voting is, indeed, ‘“‘motivated by
the audience he is playing to,”’
not the fraternity members
whom he_- supposedly
represents.

It is unfortunate that the
fraternity system, now under
siege, is represented by an IFC
President who is apparently
willing to put his own interests
above those of the constituency
which placed him in office.

Perhaps it is time that we, the
fraternity members at
Washington and Lee, seek out a
leader who will take a stand
against the Administration’s

encroachment on_ fraternity
rights.

Sincerely,

David G. Stoeffel

Regulating
Social Life

Dear Editor:

The continued attempts of
various faculty members to
regulate the social life of the
student body forces me to com-
ment on the issues at hand.

The 1979-80 University
Catalogue states that ‘‘the same
code of honor that governs
academic life guides personal
life. Washington and Lee in the
words of its current President,
confidently entrusts the largest
possible measure of choice and
freedom to its students.”’

The said Honor Code, as
established by a former Presi-
dent, rests firmly in the
freedom of the students to
establish acceptable behavior.

President Lee echoed a hun-
dred years ago Plato’s idea that
it is unnecessary to dictate to
men of breeding. I hope the re-
cent moves of the faculty does
not signal the end of these noble
ideals at Washington and Lee.

I came to W&L under the
assumption that the concepts
printed in the Catalogue were
the governing forces. I trust
these policy statements were
then and are now more than PR

see REGULATIONS, page 16

 

IFC President Questions Phi Allegations

For Fraternities Needed

Dear Editor,

After reading the articles con-
cerning fraternities and the pro-
posals of the University Council
in last week’s issue of theRing-
tum Phi I believe it is necessary
to write a letter about the real
issues behind the intellectual
movement on this campus and
the restrictions placed upon the
fraternities.

The faculty and the ad-
ministration are blaming a lack
of individual responsibility for
their actions. The faculty

believes we should study five |

nights a week. I must agree
with some of the lack of in-
dividual responsibility, but not
the reasons for the lack of it.

Fraternities and bands on
campus during the week are not
the problem. The lack of
responsibility is an attitude of a
minority of the students.

I did not come to this universi-
ty or choose to go to college to
study five nights a week. I
believe there is a lot more to
college than academics.

There is more to be learned
than what can be gotten out of
the classroom or the library.
There are athletics, school
publications, Mock Convention,
fraternities, etc. all of which
are a worthwhile learning ex-
perience.

The fraternities have improv-
ed a lot over the last year anda
half. They have an improved
reputation, cleaner houses,
more respect for the Lexington
community and have taken part
in some community projects.

The Interfraternity Council
has donated $5,000 to Contact, a
couple hundred dollars to the
United Way and no telling how
much to the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon.

Obviously the fraternities are
not totally free of guilt, but they
are not at the base of the pro-
blem.

Most people just do not want
to spend all their time learning
in the classroom or doing
homework. The fraternities
have improved and are continu-
ing to improve.

Do not try to impede progress
by placing more restrictions on
the fraternities or taking the in-
tellectual movement too far.

Secondly, I agree whole-
heartedly with the editor that
Dr. Merchant should not be the
advisor to the Interfraternity
Council. He is not on the side of
fraternities and seems to have
little compassion for them.

I would also like to point out
that he showed a lack of respon-
sibility when» speaking out
against fraternities and one in
particular during his lectures.
From my limited experience
with the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, he has been totally irra-
tional during the proceedings.
Luckily, the rest of the commit-
tee is able to control itself.

I have no solution or com-
promise for the problems that
some say are debasing our
education at Washington and
Lee. Those in charge should
deal with the problems-and not
the effects of those problems.

I just hope that they realize
the situation as it is and only
make the necessary changes
that will neither hurt the frater-
nity system nor student life as a
whole.

Sincerely,
Andy deMuth

To The Editor:

In regard to the letter by Mr. Feinman address-
ing the question “Is Syd Farrar ‘Passing the
Buck’?,’’ I would like to respond in the following
fashion. Mr. Feinman, you suggested that ‘‘one
would not need a J.D’ degree to understand...’’
something or another. It was soon obvious after
reading your letter that you are certainly the one
that does not have his J.D. degree. Most lawyers
make it their business to know the facts of the case
before they enter the courtroom. You not only did
not know the facts (for which I’m sure you will
blame the Ring-tum Phi reporting), but then you
attempted to become both judge and juror on a
case based on hearsay evidence and third-hand
knowledge. For your information:

(1) After three IFC Judicial Board sessions,
with much conflicting testimony, it was decided
that although the two Figis involved did throw
snowballs and perhaps broke windows, it was up
to Student Control to handle the individuals involv-
ed instead of penalizing the whole fraternity for
their actions.

(2) The two Fijis involved never entered the
PiKA house as you suggested.

(3) It was the duty of the IFC Judicial Board to
decide whether either fraternity was guilty of a
violation in the incident. It is not the duty of the
Judicial Board to decide the guilt or innocence of
individuals and on that basis the decision to find
out who should be responsible to the PiKAs for
damage, was passed to the Student Control Com-
mittee.

(4) In regards to fraternity involvement, the
PiKAs were commended by the Judicial Board for
their actions in trying to prevent the incident while
the Fijis (the house as a whole) were severely
reprimanded for their march down to the PiKA
house. It was suggested by the Judicial Board that
both houses keep their members away from each
other and that any future incidents would be look-
ed upon unfavorably by the Judicial Board.

So, Mr. Feinman, if you want to bitch, get your
facts staight. The IFC Judicial Board was respon-
sible only for the acts of the fraternities and not
the individuals in question. Student Control and
SAC handled the incidents of the individuals in
question. Student Control and SAC handled the in-
cidents of the individuals involved, in case you
didn’t know. From the standpoint of fraternity in-
volvement, the Judicial Board handled its case.
Maybe if you have complaints about the handling
of the cases of the students involved you ought to
take that up with Student Control. Of course, you
may disagree with the Judicial Board’s decision

not to go further than reprimanding the frater-
nities involved, but that is your perogative. It is
Strange to note, though, that on two adjoining
pages the Judicial Board was accused of ‘‘passing
the buck” to Student Control on a case involving
two individuals while in an anonymous editorial
the Judicial Board was further accused of
“‘mishandling”’ a case involving several members
of a fraternity which in the minds of the writer (or
should I say, writers) should have been sent to Stu-
dent Control. I guess it’s a no-win proposition.

Regarding the Ring-tum Phi editorial which, I
think it is interesting to note, was left unsign-
ed...anybody can write a letter to the editor or an
editorial, but I guess it takes a man to sign his
name to it. It is easy to state remarks both un-
founded and untrue, easier still to do this when not
having to say who you are and not having to back
up your statements. Isn’t that true Mr. Smith and
Mr. Billmyre? You made light of my voting record
in SAC concerning the band issue, not knowing the
facts or feelings surrounding my SAC vote. You
spoke of a “‘bargain’’ I made..I wish you had that
on tape because I’m sure that statement is quite
untrue, and inserted into your editorial to arouse
the ire of the student body.

And as to being a puppet, one thing for sure—I
won’t be a puppet to your editorials. The decisions
I’ve made, most of which have been made with the
help of the IFC Judicial Board, have been made in
good faith. So Mr. Smith and Mr. Billmyre I’m
sure that if you keep making your opinions based
on unsubstantiated facts and second-hand in-
formation that one day you will make a great cub-
reporter for a gossip column in a small town
newspaper.

Syd Farrar
Editor's Note: Comments appearing under . the
heading “Review and Outlook” express the opinions
of the editors of the Ring-tum Phi. Often they are
written by one or more persons and are intended to
represent the editorial stance of this student
newspaper. They have been unsigned all year.

Editor Randy Smith telephoned Mr. Farrar twice
last Wednesday night to give him a chance to express
his reasons for his voting switch. He declined at that
time to relate to us the “facts or feelings surrounding”
his SAC vote, as he has again failed to do in the above
letter. The word “bargain” was Mr. Farrar’s own.

Until such time as the IFC President can explain his
voting switch and can demonstrate that the facts in the
editorial were indeed “unsubstantiated” and “‘second-
hand information” (although they came from Mr. Far-
rar himself), the Ring-tum Phi stands behind the Jan.
31 editorial.

More On W&L Hangings Controversy

To the Editor:

I read with interest Mr. J.
Cabell Acree’s lamentation
over the fate of thos infamous
wall hangings (‘‘When Bettor
Women are Made, W&L Men
Will Make Them.’’)

Criticism Of
Carmichael

Dear Editor,

Today as I read the Ring-tum
Phi article ‘‘Carmichael
Predicts Organized Rebellion,”
I sat back and though about the
irony of the W&L blacks using
money given them by the
University to pay $2,000 to a
negro revolutionary for an hour
harangue on the evils of the
capitalist system. I am an ar-
dent capitalist, but I would feel
guilty if I were paid any more
than $1,000 an hour for my time.

Not only is Carmichael a
failure as a revolutionary, but
he is certainly not aiding his
race with his attitude. For
negroes to call themselves
Africans is as silly as for me to
call myself English because my
forebears came thence. For a
group of American citizens to
designate themselves
‘Africans’ calls into question
their loyality to this country and
makes one wonder to what ex-
tent they value the citizenship
which was given them.

It is quite interesting that a
speaker of Carmichael’s
notoriety was invited onto our
campus. Would it perhaps be
better to transfer most of
SABU’s budget to Contact and
bring onto campus speakers of
more general interest to the
University?

Sincerely,
David F. Mullin ’81

hype.
I caution the faculty against
Washington fever and ask them
to consider the consequences of
a Leviathon of rules and regula-
tions. The suggested regula-
tions cannot logically be enforc-
ed and more importantly they
would drastically damage the
‘‘play hard—work _hard’’
reputation of the school (which
nets most of W&L’s students).

Finally, the faculty should
concentrate on establishing ‘‘a
climate of learning’ by ex-
emplification, not by forcing
parties down icy mountain
roads. I challenge them to in-
spire us from within so that ex-
ternal regulation is made un-
necessary.

Mr. Acree’s first objection to
the Supply Store’s discontin-
uance of their sale is that since
women at W&L are such a small
minority, it is ‘‘unfair to the rest
of the student body,’’ who, ac-
cording to Mr. Acree, is clamor-
ing to purchase these items.

Questions of taste notwith-
standing, I firmly object to his
notion that slogans offensive to
a particular minority should be
tolerated and merchandized by
an institution of higher learn-
ing. Blacks are also a minority
at W&L. Would you have us
poke fun at them, Mr. Acree?

Mr. Acree’s second argument
is even more ignominious. He
objects to the law women’s
disapproval of these hangings,

because we should be busy
writing our Congressmen con-
cerning the Equal Rights
Amendment (many of us have),
rather than protesting  in-
justices closer to home.

I have two proposals for Mr.
Acree. First, if the obnoxious
hangings are to be restocked at
the Supply Store, equal space
should be given to the feminine
(feminist?) counterpart: ‘‘Until
Better W&L Men are Made,
W&L Women Will Ignore
Them;”’ and second, since Mr.
Acree is so in favor of hangings,
perhaps he would volunteer
himself as the first victim.

Gretchen C.F. Shappert

Fencing Club Neglected

Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter as a
question to the editorial staff of
the Ring-tum-Phi, specifically
those people in charge of the
sports section of the paper.

I am curious as to why the
University Fencing Club has
received almost no attention in
the sports section of the paper
this semester. Although the
paper covered our _ season
opener against James Madison
University late last semester,
(a meet which we easily won),
the paper has not printed any
articles which the club has sub-
mitted to it, as it has done in the
past.

To bring your readers up to
date, the fencing club is now
holding a 3-2 win-loss record, a
better percentage than some
varsity teams here. We have
competed against schools
where fencing has varsity sport
status, and have done extreme-
ly well for a club sport. We
defeated James Madison, lost a
close match to UVa., (which is
one of the stronger teams in the
state), and last weekend finish-
ed second to William and Mary
in a four team tournament, in
which we defeated the Universi-
ty of Maryland at Baltimore,
and Virginia Tech. We have
some talented fencers. Many of
us came home with a better
than .500 average, and soph-
omore Dave Hepler defeated
the defending state champion in
epee by the score of 5-3.

Later this year we will fence
VMI, and in two weeks our
fencers will compete for honors
in the Virginia State cup, which

Although the fencers have
club status, we are not a fly-by-
night organization. We had a
strong group of freshmen
recruits this Fall, and we will
lose only 4 seniors from the
starting nine positions. Our
team is dedicated to the sport,
we have worked hard, and we
have financed most of our own
equipment.

We feel justified in complain-
ing about the lack of attention
the paper has given to us, and
we hope that if your sports
reporters will not cover our
meets, then at least you will
print the articles we write for
you.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
William B. Sherwin ’81
