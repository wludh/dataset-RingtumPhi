 

Washington and Lee’s Homecoming
will see a weekend of sports, music, and
revelery as the school greets returning
alumni and friends.

The Allstars, the ever-popular rock
band from Charlottesville, get the week-
end off to an early start tonight with a
concert in the Cockpit. The Allstars will
play two shows, at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Tickets, which are limited to 200 per
show, are available at the door for $1.00

for students and $2.00 for others.

The festivities begin again Friday at 4
o’clock with a Student Activities Board
party on the law school field. The SAB
will provide 25 kegs and tapes.

 

E A double concert is slated for Friday

night in the old gym. The rock band Sand-
castle will start at 8:00 p.m. and will be
followed by the Catalinas, who play fif-
ties, beach, and rock music. Both the
concert and the law school party are free
to students and guests.

Saturday’s activities will be kicked off
by a rugby game at 1:00 o’clock on the
Alumni field. The football team will play
Fordham at 1:30 0n Wilson Field.

During halftime the Homecoming
Queen will be selected from one of the
talented beauties nominated by the fra-
ternities, the law school, and the Student
Association for Black Unity. As tradition
mandates, Dr. James Shillington will
crown the queen.

s Homecoming Weekend Events Begin Tonight

The Homecoming activities continue
after the game with a sophomore class
grain party at Zollman’s Pavilion fea-
turing the Bruce Hornsby Band. Class
passes are required for admission. Satur-
day night will see many fraternity par-
ties.

Rounding up the festivities will be the
annual alumni-varsity lacrosse game on
Sunday at 11a.m. on Wilson Field.

More than 250 alumni guests and their
families are expected at Washington and
Lee University for Homecoming
Weekend.

The number of alumni visitors for the
fall weekend will be somewhat smaller
than in previous years because of recent

)

changes which have placed all class re-
unions in the spring, W&L’s alumni
secretary, William C. Washburn, said.
Even so, Homecoming will be the setting
for a special alumni conference, to which
some 65 of the visiting alumni have been
invited as delegates.

“These delegates represent various
alumni chapters across the country,’’
Washburn said. ‘‘The theory is to bring
back special friends of the university for
a three-day intensive review which-will
make them better informed—alumni,
who also, in turn, will bring a great deal
of expertise to us at Washington and
Lee.’’ Special alumni conferences have
been a regular feature on the campus for
many years. J

EC Distributes
Student Funds

by Joe Scott
Working with $1,000 less
than last year, the Executive
Committee divided $73,170 of
student funds between 10 com-
mittees at Tuesday’s budget
hearings.

The recommended amounts
are still tentative with possible
future fund shuffling.

‘“‘We have less money to work
with and a lot more money was
requested,”’ said EC President
Steve Abraham. With approx-
imately 35 less students this
year, we are already at a disad-
vantage, he said.

Committee requests totalled
$97,969 or $24,799 over what was
collected from student fees and
taxes.

SAB Requests

Emphasizing fiscal tightness,
the EC cut the Student Ac-
tivities Board request by $13,020
to a level just under the $30,850
they received last year. The
figure, set at $28,430, was divid-
ed between the University
Center Committee and the re-
maining SAB expenses.

UCC Representative Jamie
Small, receiving $7,130, said
that his reason for the increase
over last year ($4,600) was
maintaining or increasing the
quality of the bands for the
Cockpit. ‘‘I would like to expand
the number of bands to around
35,’’ said Small,’’and have
bands of a little more higher
quality.’’ Small added that he
wished to put the Cockpit on “‘a
tour like circuit.’’ ‘We are
becoming a known spot on the
map,’’Small said.

‘A lot of what Jamie is trying
to do is pick up the slack,”’ said
Bill Ridge, co-chairman of the
SAB. He was refering to the
lack of on campus parties on
Wednesday nights. ‘‘I’d like to
keep the road up here,”’ Small
said, adding that the lack of
weeknight entertainment would

force many to other colleges.

Law Representative John
Fraser then moved to reduce
the ban allocation to $6,000
because ‘‘I don’t think we are
being realistic. The amount re-
mained $7,000.

The remaining $21,400 was
divided between the film com-
mittee ($3,400) with the rest
funneled to entertainment.
General office expenses and
publicity costs were budgeted
at $2,000.

Notable changes in entertain-
ment were the scratching of a
Winter Weekend and a serious
reduction in funding for the Spr-
ing Weekend. These funds were
channeled to the mixers
category with the explanation
that large rock concerts were
no longer feasible and that

_more top bar bands would be

playing at Zollman’s Pavillion.

Alumni exclusion from Fancy
Dress was discussed with Ridge
and co-chairman David Har-
pole agreeing that substantial
money would be lost with the
new ticket limit and forecast a
probable increase in this year’s
prices.

The film committee noted
that they were absorbing the
Student Bar Association films
and the EC granted an addi-
tional $100 to the SAB to be
atken from the Film society.

The Mock Convention, which
technically receives no EC
funds, was budgeted at $33,000.
The money was raised in part
by a $5 increase in student tax,
approved by the Board of
Trustees. The increase put the
tax at $50 per person and was
directly put into the Conven-
tion’s account. This procedure
is standard every convention
year.

SBA

The SBA was given $12,581.
Requested was $13,527 for this
body who governs 334 law

SAC Fines SAE

by David Greer

Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater-
nity was fined $300 by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee and the
Interfraternity Council when
some of its members misbe-
haved at Howard Johnson’s
restaurant early this year.

The IFC fined the fraternity
$50 for restitution and levied a
$50 fine for punishment. When
the case reached SAC for re-
view, as all IFC Judicial Board
cases do, SAC added a $300 fine
and placed SAE on conduct pro-

bation for the rest of the term.

Conduct probation is a warn-
ing and if the fraternity comes
before the board again it could
be in serious trouble.

Dave Constine, president of
SAE, said he appealed the SAC
fine and it was reduced to $200,
so that the total in fines was
$300. He said he wrote Howard
Johnson’s a letter of apology.

The action stemmed from an
incident at the Howard John-
son’s restaurant earlier this

NUMBER 4

Alumni

Barred

From
- Fancy
Dress

The Student Activities Board
made final its decision to stop
selling Fancy Dress tickets to
alumni and to hold the ball in
the student center.

The SAB made its decision
after holding a meeting to
discuss the issue with the stu-
dent body Sunday night. Very
few students attended the

meeting.
The decision to allow only
students, faculty, and_ staff

came after 5,000 persons attend-
ed last year’s ball. The capacity
of the Student Center, including
the dining hall is 2,139.

The fear of a fire is the major
factor in deciding to limit the at-
tendance.

The Student Activities Board
first voted Sept. 23 to hold the
ball in the gymnasium and to
allow alumni to attend. The
decision was reversed after the
SAB discussed the logistics of
having the ball there.

Problems lay in the immense
area to decorate, the locating of
several activities in two gyms
and a classroom, and the at-
mosphere. “‘It’ll look like your
high-school prom,”’ said Jamie
Small.

Last year, 600 to 650 alumni
and their dates attended Fancy
Dress. This year, one ticket per
student will be printed. A stu-
dent can sell his ticket to
whomever he pleases.

The SAB suggested that the
Alumni Ball, held in the spring,
be open to all alumni. Present-
ly, the Alumni Ball is open only
to alumni holding reunions that
weekend,

Monday Night

 

EC Apologizes To Pub Board

by Joe Scott

Personal apologies were
given to the Publications Board
resulting from an unauthorized
withdrawal from their reserve
fund of $2,000 at Monday night’s
Executive Committee meeting.

“Tt turns out it was improper
advice,” said EC vice-president
Les Cotter. ‘‘An oversight was
made. It was a mistake made
out of ignorance,’’ he added.

The discrepency surfaced
when the Pub. Board was told of
the EC withdrawal after it had
already occurred. The money,
added to $3,000 from the Student
Body Reserve Fund, was used
as an advance payment to the
Calyx in order to take ad-
vantage of a two percent dis-
count publishing rate. The Pub
Board’s money is independent
of EC funding. (See letter to the editor,
page 14.) ‘

The financial advice was
given to Cotter by Louis V.
Synder, Business Manager and
Assistant Treasurer, who also
offered his apologies. The
dispersement has already been
put back in the account.

Ben Keesee, President of the
Pub Board who submitted a

statement questioning the ac-
tion, said he had no objection to
the procedure itself. ‘“The over-
sight” he said, ‘‘was not notify-

ing the Pub Board.”’
Research Ad
“I think it’s potentially

dangerous,”’ said Senior EC
Representative Dee Keesler
referring to the Ring-tum Phi
research paper ad. “It is a
potential object of abuse.”

The EC discussion emerged
when the committee’s general
opinion on the ad’s effect on the
honor code was sought by Ran-
dy Smith, Editor-in-Chief of the
Ring-tum Phi.

”T would like to see it out of
the paper,”’ said Sophomore EC
Representative Nelson Ould.
EC President Steve Abraham
agreed saying that it should be
withdrawn.

“I see no problem with runn-
ing the ad itself,’’ said Senior
EC Rep. Jay Blumberg. “By
taking it out we are saying that
we don’t trust the students,” he
added. ‘‘I don’t think it offends
anyone who has confidence in
the honor system.”’

Later a point was made by EC
senior Law Rep. John Fraser

that a better procedure would
be to ask the Pub Board’s ad-
vice.

Junior EC Rep. Rob Willis
disagreed. ‘I think we shouldn’t
sjuff this off on the Pub Board.”’
Further comments by Fraser
still contended that it was im-
proper for the EC to comment.

The motion to delete the ad
failed with a tying vote of 5-5.
Willis then recommended that
the Phi discontinue the ad until
the payment for the advertise-
ment had been received and un-
til the Pub Board had met to
discuss the matter. Keesee then
said the Pub Board could ac-
tually accomplish nothing on
the matter.

Monthly Reports

Monthly reports by the Stu-
dent Activities Board, the Cold
Check Committee, and _ the
Ring-tum Phiwere reviewed by
the EC.

Jim Vines, chairman of the
Cold Check Committee, paid
back $400 to the EC from a
previous loan to cover bad
check offenders. Adding that
money still has not been receiv-
ed from some students, one of
whom is no longer at
Washington and Lee, Vines sug-
gested that the lawyer on re-
tainer by the EC, Thomas
Spencer, be authorized to of-
ficially send letter to habitual
offenders.

Keesler asked if any other
measures were being taken by
the committee to which Vines
‘replied that ‘other transcripts
are being held.”

The EC cited a serious com-
munications problem that ex-
isted in the SAB showing of Pat-

ton this past weekend. The SAB
explained that an experienced
projectionist was needed for the
five-reel movie and that no one
from the Board was able to han-
dle the scheduled showings
because of the conflicting SAB’s
Sunday meeting on Fancy
Dress.

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Kevin McGowan filed
an informal report outlining an
$800 deficit for the first three
issues of the newspaper. Addi-
tional comments citing costs
and savings were noted.

“IT hope we don’t step on any
toes tomorrow night,” said
Abraham, speaking about Tues-
day evening’s budget hearings.
(See story page 1.) ‘‘We will try
to be as equitable with the
money as we can,”’ he said. ‘‘We
will try to be fair to everyone.”

by the EC is still in effect with
the SBA supplying an additional

Friday to explain W&L’s honor
system. The discussion was
reportedly well received.

Mock Convention Report

 

by Jim Vines

The most widely known
aspect of Gerald R. Ford’s can-
didacy these days, is the uncer-
tainty of its existence. Mr. Ford
seems to be the Republican
Party’s counterpart to Sen. Ed-
ward Kennedy, playing the
waiting game to the hilt.

Though Mr. Ford is con-
sidered to be among the
strongest choices for the
Republican nomination, there is
sentiment that he will not even
choose to run. At best, he con-
siders himself ‘‘available for
the campaign, only if invited.”

Close associates feel several
‘improbable things will have to
happen in an improbable se-
quence before Mr. Ford’s name
will be seen on any ballot in the
state primaries.”

In the event he decides to run,
Mr. Ford will probably skip the
first few primaries and wait un-
til some of the secondary con-
tenders are dropped from the
ballots. This is due to a visible
trace of self-confidence on Mr.
Ford’s part. He is reasonably
sure that he is seen as the only
anti-Reagan savoir, besides be-
ing certain the population is
aware of its mistake in 1976.

His strength against Mr.
Reagan has been affirmed in
several unofficial, unpublished
polls taken by the National
Republican Party, which shows
the former president as the only
man within reach of the ex-
actor.

Hopefuls like Sen. Howard
Baker and former Texas Gov.
John Connally fall behind Mr.
Ford despite the certainity of
their participation in the race.

Regardless of the fact that
President Jimmy Carter’s
volatile two and one half years
in office are making Mr. Ford’s
two and one half years of firm
leadership look rather attrac-
tive, Mr. Ford is up against
some formidable personal bar-
riers to his candidacy.

Betty Ford’s health has been
known to be aggravated by
public life and it appears that
two years out of the limelight
have been beneficial to her well-
being. There is little doubt this

will weigh heavily in Mr. Ford’s
decision, not only because of
consideration for his wife but
through memory of _ her
outspoken candor during his
term in the White House.

Besides his wife, there is the
obstacle of a pleasant retire-
ment to overcome. For the past
30 months Mr. Ford has been
living what has been sar-
castically described as a
“rough’”’ life.

At his well-known retreat at
Vail, Colo., close to his favorite
pipe and his beloved ski slopes,
Mr. Ford is understandably
hesitant to resume the rigors of
a politician’s career.

He has been able to satisfy his
appetite for the political game
through his writing—A Time To
Heal—and the frequent and
lucrative public appearances he
claims to enjoy, though it is
rumored that he considers these
functions a despised duty.

Last week, Mr. Ford took his
predicted stand against SALT II
in a lengthy essay appearing in
the Washington Post.In the
event that he does elect to enter
the race, he will likely need his
opposition to the SALT II treaty

_ to offset the nagging memory in
the minds of many conservative
Republicans of his support for
the controversial Panama
Canal Treaty.

Mr. Ford has also been spend-
ing some time trying to explain
the validity of the Nixon pardon
with the expectation it would

Ford Candidacy Uncertain

not be used against him in a
future campaign.

A final indication that he is
definitely considering abstain-
ing from the action, is the go-
ahead he has granted to some of
his most important financial
supporters, who have displayed
a desire to back other can-
didates in the event Mr. Ford
does not run.

For a candidate who is not in-
dependently wealthy, though he
would have a difficult time in
qualifying for food stamps,
missing such major support
with very little time left to ac-
quire new resources would be
dangerous in this day when
cash flow is as vital in the pur-
suit of a primary victory as are
the issues,

Theater Group Performs Soon

Roadside Theater, a traveling
troupe from the mountains of
Kentucky, will present its most
recent show on the Washington
and Lee University campus
next Wednesday (Oct. 10). En-
titled ‘Brother Jack,” the pro-
duction will begin at 8 p.m. in
the Troubadour Theatre at the
corner of Main and Henry

Review

Streets.
Roadside’s style evolved
from the storytelling its

members grew up watching and
hearing — southern Ap-
palachian “‘tall tales,’’ remem-
brances, and both original and
traditional songs aecompanied
by guitar, banjo and fiddle.

Americathon

 

Directed by Neil Israel, Written
by Phillip Proctor and Peter
Bergman, With Harvey Kor-

 

man, Fred Willard, and
Richard Sehall
by Dash Coufal Korman is uninspired as the

Americathon is full of clever
lines; proving once again that
cleverness, while amusing, has
no substance.

In Americathon America
owes some 400 billion to a
manufacturer of clown-feet
(trust me). The treasury is flat
broke, there are no fossil fuels,
people live in cars, bicycles are
the major form of transporta-
tion, and Vietnam is the Rivera
of the future (I didn’t invent
this). After rejecting such ideas
as raffeling off the tomb of the
unknown soldier (‘‘T.V. Raffels
don’t work’’), the President, a
graduate of EST, decides to
have a thirty day telethon to
bail America out, the
Americathon.

The only strength of the
movie is in its cleverness. Say-
ing that dinosaurs died out
because they were all teeth and
no brains, and then showing
Jimmy Carter, is funny, but
hundreds of these cleverisms
are hardly enough to propel a
movie. The movie has a unify-
ing plot, but the plot itself is not
funny and can’t be saved by one
liners.

Fred Willard, the genius who |

played Gerry Hubbard on
America 2-nite, is wasted in the
role of the movie’s villian. His
great gift, acting dumb with
sidesplitting irony, is nowhere
to be seen in this part. Harvey

television host, having but one
funny moment.

Richard Schall, who played
Boon in Aminal House, is lost in
chaos as the central character,
a media specialist, and seems
to be there only to add a sense of
the first person. He hasn’t even
been given straight lines that
are played upon. Things are fur-
ther complicated since Schall’s
first-person voice-overs have
been given to George Carlin,
who sounds more like Willard
than Schall.

The authors, Proctor and
Bergman, are masters of the
fifteen-minute sketch but not
two-hour movies. Having seen
them live, I can say that by and
large they and their material
are funny. They a 2, alas,

nowhere to be. seen in
Americathon.
Americathon is, however,

funnier than Jerry Lewis on -

Labor Day.
If you’re still thinking of go-
ing, then do, because

Americathon is preceded by a
short called Doubletalk that is a
small masterpiece. In
Doubletalk a boy comes to pick
up his date and we hear not only
the dialogue, but also the peo-
ple’s thoughts. The situation is
laced with prejudice and
hypocrisy. If only Doubletalk
could have been the feature,
and Americathon a_fifteen-
minute Proctor and Bergman
sketch.

were collected within 50 miles
of Roadside’s home by the
W.P.A. Writers’ Project in the
1930s. With this blend of actual
history and original material,
the players weave a sense of the
flow of time in the mountains
from the turn of the century to
today.

The group is a “road” com-
pany in the strictest sense of the
word. Roadside has no resident
theater, but performs continu-
ally throughout the southern
and mid-Atlantic states. Its cur-
rent tour includes stops at Lin-
coln Center in New York and at
Washington’s Kennedy Center.

In addition to its performance
in Lexington, the three mem-
bers of the troupe — Ron Short,
Angie DeBord, and Tommy
Bledsoe — will conduct a
workshop Thursday morning
(Oct. 11) in the Troubadour
Theatre. Both events are free,
and the public is welcome.

W&L Grads Present Art

Two Washington and Lee |

University graduates will re-
turn to the campus this fall to
exhibit some of their recent art-
works in the campus bookstore.
The first, Stephen K. Roberts,
has already opened his show,
which continues until Nov. 8. He
will be followed by Drayton N.
Smith, whose drawings will be
on display until the start of
W&L’s Christmas vacation.

Roberts is diligent in his pur-
suit of art as a full-time career,
and acknowledges ‘‘varied
amounts of success.’’ Most of
his projects are in silk-screen,
and are being exhibited this
year in five galleries, most of
which are in the Washington
area.

His style — dominated by
black lines and vibrant colors —
is an offshoot of techniques he
developed as a student at W&L
in the early 1970s. Roberts gives
much of the credit for his ar-
tistic development to I-Hsiung
Ju, W&L’s artist-in-residence,
who “has kept me in the art
scene until the present,” he
said.

Roberts was a student of Ju’s
when the Art Farm was estab-
lished — a local haven for bud-
ding artists to work and exhibit
— and he also accompanied the
teacher to Taiwan for further
study. ‘Prof. Ju paid for my
airplane ticket in return for my
work at the Art Farm in its in-
itial summer,’’ he said.

A 1976 graduate of W&L,
Roberts’ recent commissions
include the official poster, ex-
ecuted in silk-screen, for
Children’s Day at the National
Collection of Fine Arts of the:
Smithsonian Institution last
summer. For his bookstore ex-
hibition, he has prepared a suite
of W&L campus scenes, ‘‘the

first time I’ve tried this style

with outdoor subjects.”’
Drayton Smith’s exhibition,
which will immediately follow

Roberts’ collection, is compos-
ed primarily of drawings and
etchings of human figures. Con-
sidered a realist in the technical
sense, he comments that he
“tries not to overlook the ob-
vious. In essence, I guess you
could call me a ‘day-to-day’
realist ‘

Smith also cites Prof. Ju as a
guiding force — along with such
diverse figures as Dr. James
Leyburn, emeritus professor of
sociology and former dean of
the university, Dr. W. Barlow
Newbolt of the physics depart-
ment, emeritus professor of

John Gunn of W&L’s economics
department. Gerard M. Doyon,
also of the W&L art depart-
ment, ‘“‘has been a great help to
me even after graduation,”
Smith added.

The 1974 graduate taught for

four years at the Porter-Gaud
School in Charleston, S.C.
(Coaching the football team
was the best part, the artist
laughingly adds.) He spent the
summer of 1977 studying at the
Sorbonne in Paris, and the next
summer saw him at the Medical
College of South Carolina, ex-
ecuting detailed studies of
human anatomy.

Among Smith’s most inter-
esting projects was a series of
sculptures for the blind, com-
missioned by the Gibbes Art
Gallery in Charleston, where
W&L’s collection of Louise
Herreshoff paintings was ex-
hibited last spring. Another
noteworthy project was carried
out this summer when he
designed sets for the Henry
Street Playhouse production of
“The Contrast,’’ in Lexington’s
Troubadour Theater. One of
Smith’s drawings — a scene of
Washington Hall — was fea-
tured on the cover of W&L’s
alumni magazine last October.

WLUR Plays Ball

And to think it all started with
a game of touch football...

Such is the story from WLUR-
FM station manager Robert J.
deMaria, assistant journalism
professor, about the part to be
played by Washington and Lee
University in the founding of a
student-operated radio station
at Sweet Briar College.

According to deMaria,
students involved in W&L’s
radio station — _ primarily
Junior Ben Keesee, Public Af-
fairs Director, and Junior Cur-
ran Snipes, Music Director —
called Sweet Briar to challenge
their female counterparts to a
game. Instead, they received
their own challenge — to aid the

girls in the debut broadcasts of
WSBC, as -the new station is
called.

Today the WLUR staff will
drive to Sweet Briar for a three-
hour training session concern-
ing the behind-the-scenes world
of radio production. Supervis-
ing this and other programs for
the emerging 10-watt station is
student manager Stephanie
Stitts. Her staff has said WSBC
is in dire need of records and
tapes, and donations will be
greatly appreciated.

Another case of W&L gallan-
try to the rescue? To be sure.
But never fear — the football
game is also going on as
scheduled, and the post-game
drinks are on the girls.
“Fidelio” Airs Monday

The Chicago Symphony’s
fourth season of radio broad-
casts opens this year with a con-
cert performance of Beetho-
ven'’s only opera, ‘‘Fidelio,”
Monday (Oct. 8) at 6 p.m. on
WLUR-FM, Washington and
Lee University’s radio station.
WLUR is at 91.5 0n the FM dial.

Performed under music di-
rector Sir Georg Solti, the
presentation will feature
soprano Hildegard Behrens and
tenor Peter Hofmann as the
principals, Leonore’ and
Florestan, with bass Theo
Adam as the evil Don Pizarro.

“High minded” is the most
common phrase used_ to
describe Beethoven's
‘Fidelio.”’ Its themes are the
celebration of married love,
and the triumph of freedom
over tyranny.

Beethoven disapproved of the
more frivolous type of operatic
subjects in fashion — the year
was 1805, and works in the style
of Mozart were the rage — and
never sueceeded in finding a se-
cond suitable libretto. However,
into ‘‘Fidelio’ he poured
enough energy to have compos-

Rock

by Mark Kinniburgh

Modern rock and roll, dating
from the mid-sixties, has taken
many different paths which
have established currents of
popular music. A_ rough
schematic would feature, say,
Fats Domino or Elvis at the lub
of a wheel, and the ever-
growing spokes would be the
many classifications of today’s
rock. In very rough terms,
there is Country Rock, Hard
Rock, New Wave, Soft Rock and
Traditional Rock.

New Wave would appear to be
the junior member of this set,
and maybe even an unabashed
fluke or incorrect choice. The
fact is however, that the old
Beatles when they were star-
ting, wore leather jackets and
were about as punk as today’s
Romones.

New Wave has always been a
factor in rock, although never
really labeled as such. I tend. to
call my driving force in rock
**New Wave” because of the im-
plication that it is, in reality
leading the rest of its contem-
poraries through a “wave” of a
new style or feeling in music.

But back into the discussion
of where the music world on its
wheel of ‘‘genve"’, and to begin
with Country Rock, there is a
real problem. Bands like the

ed several others. He revised
the work completely twice, and
as for overtures — the case is
unique in music history — he
composed no less than four: the
three well-known ‘‘Leonore’”’
overtures, and finally the
“Fidelio” overture that is
generally acoepted as the most
suitable to his operatic purpose.

The story of ‘Fidelio’ starts
before the action of the opera
begins. Florestan, the idealistic
victim of political oppression,
has been imprisoned for two
years by Don Pizarro, governor
of a Spanish state prison.
Florestan’s devoted wife,
Leonore, suspecting the truth
behind her husband’s mysteri-
ous disappearance, has manag-
ed to enter the service of Rocco,
the jailer — hoping to win his
confidence and find her hus-
band. To obtain the post, how-
ever, she has had to disguise
herself as a young man, Fidelio.
The action of the opera deals
with the gradual unfolding of
Leonore-Fidelio’s successful
ploy and the last-minute rescue
of Florestan.

Musical highlights include, in

Music Classification

Allman Brothers have been
kicking around since 1969 with
various personel changes and
internal troubles, and now, with
the fall of the South’s Capricorn
records, it’s difficult to say
where the future of country is to
be.

One suggestion is the quintet
of Molly Hatchet, who some
contend is the reincarnation of
Lynrd Skynyrd. On their latest
album entitled ‘‘Flirtia -With
Disaster’’ they show the pro-
mise of an early Lynyrd with a
new twist of power.

The new sound also is com-
plemented by the superior
musicianship of the band, and
although they lack an anthem
such as *‘Freebird’’, be on the
lookout for some more albums
from Molly Hatchet.

Hard Rock is always difficult
to rationalize and even worse to
pick what will be trend setting
and commercially successful
even 2 months in advance. Most
major record companies are
skeptical about hard rock
releases because of the high

 

Act. I, Don Pizarro’s aria ex-
plaining his hatred of
Florestan, a showpiece for a
bass, and the famous
‘‘Prisoner’s Chorus’? which
closes the act, and in Act II,
‘“Florestan’s Aria,” in which
the tenor laments his state and
dreams ecstatically of Leonore.
Currently in his 11th year as
music director of the Chicago
Symphony, Sir Georg Solti has
led the orchestra to a position
perhaps unmatched since the
days of Toscanini and the NBC
Orchestra. He made _ his
American debut in San Fran-
cisco in 1953, and assumed
directorship of the Royal Opera
House at Covent Garden in 1959.
His reign lasted 10 years and
culminated in his knighthood,
bestowed by Queen Elizabeth
II. Last month, Solti assumed
the additional post of principal
conductor and artistic director
of the London Philharmonic.

burn-out rate.

For example, the Kiss album
“Dynasty” had a great deal of
publicity and was expected to
be a huge commercial success.
It failed miserably.

My favorite hard rock album
of late is the Queen double
album “‘Live Killers’’, recorded
on an early 1979 tour of Europe.
Critics may pan this album as a
typical Queen album with what
they deserve, an audience.

Library Obtains Letter Collection

An important collection of
ante-bellum letters written by
Dr. Alfred Leyburn, native of
Lexington and a student at
Washington College in the early
1820s, has been added to the
special collections of the
undergraduate library at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.
The letters, primarily per-
sonal in nature, discuss many of
the leading families of the col-
lege community from the 1820s
through the 1840s. Donors of the
collection are Mrs. Marion
Junkin and Margo Junkin,
descendants of Dr. Leyburn.

Born in 1803, Alfred Leyburn
was the son of Capt. John and
Jane McDowell Leyburn. He at-
tended Washington College for
two years before transferring to
Princeton University. After
medical school, he set up prac-
tice in Lexington and began a
long period of closs association
with Washington College, as
Washington and Lee was called
until 1871. In 1840 he was elected
to the school’s Board of
Trustees, a position he held for
several decades.

Perhaps the most noteworthy
contribution made by Dr.
Leyburn in these years was in

pn an

1865 when, as secretary of the
Board of Washington College,
he drafted the letter inviting
Robert E. Lee to become the
president of the war-torn
school.

Leyburn became the rector of
the board in 1872. During all
these years, and up to his death
in 1878, Leyburn was an active
force in the affairs of the
Presbyterian church.

W&L Head _ Librarian
Maurice D. Leach Jr., com-
mented that the group of letters
and genealogies ‘‘complement
superbly our  Lexington-
Rockbridge manuscript
resources such as_ the
Zachariah Johnson and William

A. Anderson papers, the
University archives, and the
Rockbridge Historical Society
manuscripts which are housed
here. Historians studying the
area will find these items of ex-
ceptional interest.”’

Alfred Leyburn’s  great-
grandson is Dr. James Graham
Leyburn, the eminent
sociologist and social historian
who taught at Washington and
Lee for a quarter-century until
his retirement in 1972. James
Leyburn was dean of the univer-

. Sity at W&L from 1947 until 1955.

Irish” and the award-winning
‘Haitian People” among many
volumes, Dr. Leyburn now lives

Major casting has been an-
nounced for the Drama Depart-
ment’s production of William
Shakespeare’s Hamlet which
will be presented at the
Troubadour Theatre from Oct.
29 until Nov. 3. Rehearsals for
the tragedy have begun.

Cast in the title role of the
play is sophomore Grant
Kunkowski, a drama major who
has previously appeared in
Ghost Sonata and played the ti-
tle role in The Guardsman.

Hamlet’s friend Horatio will
be portrayed by Kurt Kam-
merrer, a junior, who is also a
drama major. He played the
lead role last year in Otherwise

Engaged.

Rob Davis, a sophomore, will
play Polonius. A drama major,
he was featured last year in The
Guardsman and Otherwise
Engaged.

Frank Billingsly has been
chosen to play Polonius’ son,
Laertes.

Also cast have been Terry
Frankenberger, a senior drama
major, as the King, Claudius,
and Betty Kahn as his wife,
Gertrude. The part of Ophelia

will be played by Sherry Moore.
The play is being directed by
Lee Kahn, head of the Drama
Division of Fine Arts. His most
recent assignments have _in-
cluded The Guardsman,
Oedipus Rex and Uncle Vanya.

designed by faculty designer
Tom Ziegler. He told the Ring-
tum Phi that the play is “‘being
done in the traditional style”’
with Medieval period settings.

Ziegler also said the play
would be a challenging one in
that the ‘‘logistics of getting (a
hugh cast) together learning
their lines’’ is difficult, and it is
hard to make a_classic—
especially a Shakespearian
tragedy—interesting to modern
audiences. He feels that they
are lucky to have a good pro-
duction and a strong cast.

Hamlet will play from Mon-

We are aware of the financial
constraints, said SBA President
William L. Garrett. ‘‘We are in
the same position you are in,”’
he added, ‘‘and our padding is
minimal.”

“This is one example of how
costs are going up and they are
asking for the same thing,”’ said
Law Representative John
Fraser. ‘‘Even though we have
eight students fewer, we're get-
ting screwed out of $1,000-that’s
the bottom line.”

The EC’s reason for granting
less funds was attributed to
fewer law school students. Of
the student tax that the law
students paid, 86.2 percent went
to the SBA.

“We are faced with more
awesome costs then ever
before,” said Ring-tum Phi
Editor-in-Chief Randy Smith.‘
It is now going to cost $6,000 to
$7,000 more to put out the
paper,” he said. ‘‘Our printing
costs are up about than 20 per-
cent.”’

The Phi requested $13,367 to
offset the increases and keep
the paper at or slightly above
last year’s size. ‘“This year we
are going 16 per week,” said
Business Manager’ Kevin
McGowan. A 14 page issue was
the previous average.

“We are cutting costs every
way we can,”’ Smith said and
added that this year’s issues
would have. anational flavor
that directly affects W&L
students. Also hoped was an in-
crease in investigative pieces.

Senior EC Representative
Jay Blumberg motioned ten-
tatively to give them $8,500 with
Senior EC Rep. Dee Keesler ad-

ding that additional money
could come from the Contact
budget.

EC Secretary Cove Geary ad-
ded that Mock Convention copy
every week gave the paper less
room to work with.

A total of $500 was withdrawn
from Contact and the Phi was
awarded $9,000.

Co-Chairmen Scott Cardozo
and Channing Hall of the Con-

Concerns were raised by

Keesler as to possible cost cut-
ting by co-sponsoring a lecturer
with the Mock Convention. Hall
said that they had not as yet
looked into a Mock Convention

joint venture because Contact

had yet to develope a
‘‘speaker’s theme.”
Additional discussion  con-

cerned the selection procedure
for fraternity receptions. It was
noted that several houses had
entertained speakers more fre-
quently while others had yet to
have a reception at all. ‘No
potential for scandal”’ would ex-
ist if fraternities were picked in
order, “right down the list,”

received $600 for the W&L Film

from the SAB budget. The socie-
ty hopes to sponsor nine films

helpful. Diesing said though
that the SAB was “‘going for a

English Club
The EC gave $300 to the W&L
English Club, a $200 increase
over last year. The money will
help pay for three visiting lec-
turers, their meals and

Rugby Club

‘“There’s a good possibility
that we may cease to operate,”
said Alex Richards during the
Rugby Club budget request.
The EC considered cancelling
the request due to past
mismangement of the team.
‘“That’s in the past now,”’ said
Richards.

Asking for $670 for the
semester, Richards placed
most of the expense on gas.
Richards said that the club
members already were paying
for their own uniforms and for
$15 in club dues.

There are 43 people on the
team this year and we have an
eight game schedule. Fan sup-
port has also increased tremen-
dously. Our club is definitely
improving, said Richards.
Awarded was half the amount
of $330.

Keesler submitted the first
Squash Club budget request and
was given $50. Reasons given
for social expenses were that it
“goes alone with the squash
match.” Keesler added that
“people would shy away from
the club if $2 dues were charg
ed.”’

The EC noted that if litigation
between the rock group
‘“Firefall’” were successful,
more money would be available

to all. They cautioned though
that the matter might not be
settled this vear.

Currently in the three EC ac-
counts of expense, funding, and

total $1,809.89 excluding the ex-

Students Convicted, Fined
For Playing In Street

Three members of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were found
guilty of ‘‘playing in the street”’
in Lexington General District
Court Tuesday by Judge Joseph
Hess.

The three students, Hall Vet-
terlein, Ham Davis, and Scott
Graham, were issued sum-
monses by Sgt. Jack Purvis of
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment on September 9 for throw-
ing a football in the street in
front of the fraternity house.

Judge Hess said that he was
concerned that someone would
get hit by a car. He told the
three students to pass the word
on to others, especially
members of fraternities with
small yards, that the city has
several designated recreation
areas, which, though not always
conveneint to the students, are
necessary so people are not all
over the place.

  

y

€

Velterlein stated that the
three were not involved ina full-
fledged game, and therefore the
chance of getting hit by a car
was diminished. Hess ruled that
no fine would be imposed, but
that the students must pay $13
court costs. The football, which
was conficatea at the time of ar-
rest, was returned.

Today’s Lesson:

Winning!

by Ray McNulty
Sports Editor

O.K. class, now I’m sure of it. After watching the
lowly Green Bay Packers humiliate the mighty New
England Patriots on national television Monday
night, I’m convinced that all it takes to be a winner in
sports is the desire to outplay your opponent, a little
luck and an extreme amount of pride.

The Packers went into the game with several
starters injured, the second worst offense and defense
in the league, and a 1-3 record. The Patriots went into
the game with a 3-l record and the NFL’s number-one
offense and number-two defense.

But the Pack came to play. Playing at home and on
national TV, the Packers looked like the Packers of
the Lombardi era. Lombardi’s philosophy was
simple—the team that blocks and tackles better is the

team that will win. And who can argue with Lom-

bardi’s record?

Monday night, the Packers out-blocked, out-tackled
and simply out-hustled the Patriots. Playing with the
same pride and enthusiasm that has been the
trademark of football in Green Bay since 1919, the
Pack earned a 27-14 victory.

The Packers were not supposed to win Monday
nightThey were 10 point underdogs. But point spreads
didn’t mean much to the fellas from Wisconsin. New
England may have had the statistics on their side, but
the Packers had their pride—and pride can go an
awful long way.

Even when they were down and it looked like it
would be an easy New England victory, the Pack
didn’t quit. The Patriots jumped out to an early 7-0
lead in the first quarter, but the Pack came back.
Scoring three unanswered touchdowns and stifling
the Patriots’ usually-potent offense, Green Bay took a
commanding 20-7 lead. They even surprised Howie.

The Patriots did manage to score again, but a com-
bination of some hard running, timely passing and
tenacious defense enabled the Pack to hold on for a 13-
point win.

Pride, hustle and desire are the elements for any
winning formula. Of course, there is the element of
luck—but everyone needs a little luck once in a while.
With these four ingredients, any obstacle can be
overcome—even having less talent than your op-
ponents. This was proven Monday night in Green Bay.

End of lesson.

Generals Lose

Late TD Downs W&L 15-8

by Dale Park
If last week’s game against

. Randolph-Macon could be sum-

med up in one word, the word
would be frustration.

The Generals showed the
same tenacious defense as they
did the week before against
Centre and included an improv-
ed offensive effort. Yet this was
not enough as W&L lost in the
final minutes of the game, 15-8.

The Yellow Jackets were held
scoreless for almost the entire
first half. Senior defensive back
Mark Lewis led the effort,
breaking up a crucial pass in
Macon’s first offensive series
and intercepting a pass to stop a
subsequent series of downs.

The W&L offense began to
move the ball early in the se-
cond period as quarterback Jim
Wenke hit slotback Chris Leiser
with a pass to move the ball to
the Yellow Jacket 26 yard line.
The drive was stalled, however,
as a W&L fumble was
recovered by Macon’s Sam
Larsen.

This was the only fumble
recovered by Macon all day. In
all, W&L fumbled three times
yet lost the ball only once. The
General defense caused four
Yellow Jacket fumbles, three of
which were recovered by W&L.

The General defense
countered immediately. A
Macon sloppy snap was im-

mediately recovered by senior
defensive tackle Mike Mrlik on
the Macon 26 yard line.

This time the Generals
capitalized. Although the offen-
sive drive stalled, freshman
kicker Bill Devine booted a 40-
yard field goal to give the
Generals a 3-0 lead.

“Devine did a super job for
us,’’ said head coach Gary
Fallon. ‘‘Bill has a lot of en-
thusiasm, yet was’ very
relaxed—he showed a lot of
poise.”

Yet two defensive lapses were
to cost the Generals the game,
lapses that become more
frustrating when compared to
the overall defensive effort.

The first occurred with time
running out in the first half.
Macon drove to the Generals’ 20
yard line, but a defensive surge
led by sophomore defensive
ends John Winans and Tom No-
ble pushed the Yellow Jackets
back to the W&L 33.

Faced with a tough fourth and
25, Macon quarterback Sean
Shull threw a desperate pass to
wide receiver Roger Casseum.
Barely in bounds, Casseum
caught the pass for a touchdown
with only 1:34 left in the second
quarter. The conversion was
successful and the half ended
with the Generals trailing 7-3.

Passing and_ defending
against the pass proved to be
the key to the Generals’ loss.
While Macon was able to gain
111 yards through the air, the
General managed to connect for
only 46 yards.

On the ground, the situation
was different. W&L outrushed
the Yellow Jackets 127 to 95
yards, and were penalized for
only 25 yards as compared to
Macon’s 70 yards.

In the third quarter, the
Generals defense quickly cut
Macon’s lead to 7-5 as defensive
end Noble sacked Yellow
Jacket quarterback John
Lysher in the endzone for a
safety.

Receiving the ball on the free
kick, W&L moved to the Macon
36 before being stopped.
Randolph-Macon took over
after a Syd Farrar punt, but im-
mediately fumbled. Again, the
ever-present Mike Mrlik
recovered on the Macon 16.

Four plays later, Devine was
called on to boot his second field
goal of the game, this time from

W&L, VMI Golfers

Begin Invitational

Golf teams from Washington
& Lee University and the
Virginia Military Institute will
pool their resources this
weekend to host the first annual
VMI/W&L University Invita-
tional. The 36-hole event is
scheduled for Saturday, and
Sunday, October 6 & 7, and will
take place on the 6444-yard Lex-
ington Golf and Country Club
course,

“This tournament is a first
for our area of the state, looking
at the response we received
from the schools invited, I’d say
we’ve got a strong annual
event,”” commented Generals’
coach Buck Leslie, referring to
the fact that 13 Virginia schools
will participate in the Invita-
tional.

Play on both days begins at
8:00 a.m, A practice round is
scheduled for Friday, October
5.

All of the state’s Division I
schools are lined up (Rich-

mond, Virginia, Old Dominion,
Virginia Tech, VMI, and
William & Mary) along with
five schools from the Division
III, Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference (W&L, Lynchburg,
Roanoke, Hampden-Sydney,
and_ Bridgewater).
Madison and Virginia Com-
monwealth round out the field.
Captain Gerry Barousse will
top the Generals’ line-up in the
tourney. The senior from New
Orleans, La., earned All-
American honors last year and
won the ODAC inidividual title.
Lettermen Bill Alfano, Tom
Wall, and Jim Kaplan will man

W&L’s second, third, and fourth '

positions, respectively. Titus
Harris will round out the team.

28 yards. With 14:15 left in the
game, the Generals had an 8-7
lead.

It was not to remain so,
however, as Macon began to
move the ball late in the final
period. Yellow Jacket quarter-
back Shull took his team to the
W&L 35 yard line.

Under a fierce General pass
rush, Shull threw up a wobbly,
last chance pass and what ap-
peared to be an easy intercep-
tion.

For just a moment, the
General defense again lapsed,
allowing the ball to find its way
through three W&L defenders to
Macon’s Chuck Gupton at the
W&L 8 yard line. Three plays
later, Macon running back
David Beatty scooted in for the
score. The two-point conversion
was successful, and with 2:32
left in the game, Randolph-
Macon took the lead, 15-8.

A last-chance drive by the
Generals ended in the arms of
Yellow Jacket defensive back
Ted Koepsel who intercepted a
W&L desperation pass. °

“‘We have to put 60 minutes of
good football together,” said
Fallon after the game. ‘‘At this
point, the team is still highly ag-
gressive and very com-
petitive.”

Other defensive standouts
were defensive tackle Dave
Nickels who recovered an early
fumble, and defensive back
Gene Newton who broke up
several Macon passing at-
tempts. .

The Generals take on the
Rams of Fordham at next
Saturday’s Homecoming game.
Fallon describes Fordham as
“a big, explosive football team
with an especially good
defense.’’ The Rams have 13 out
of last year’s 22 starters return-
ing and have a present record of
1-2.

“Not much more could have
gone wrong for us,’’ were Coach
Dick Miller’s words for last
Saturday’s cross country meet
at Salem, Virginia. The
Generals lost to Roanoke Col-
while they did
manage to nip Norfolk State
52-55.

The team got into trouble
when two of its top five harriers
could not finish the meet. The
two freshmen, Jon Kelafant and
Fred Cuadel, had finished se-
cond and fifth, respectively, in
the General’s previous meet.

The top finisher for the team
was senior captain Rich Bird.
Bird finished second overall.
Placing second for the team and
ninth overall was Greg Branan.

Following him were Charles
Warner in 1ith place, Walt
Anasovitch in 13th place and
Howard Herndon in 17th place.
Other finishers were Nick
Stieglitz, Ted Fletcher and Ham
Davis.

 

 
Commentary:

WE&L Football:
Young & Eager

by Bill Whalen
Last Saturday was Youth Day at Randolph-Macon.
No, it was not a promotional gimmick, the youths
were out on the field playing for the Generals.

 

Of the 22 players who started for W&L last Satur-
day, 17 were underclassmen. Of more importance is
_the fact that nine of the 17 started on defense.

In football, individual games are decided by the of-
fense. A good defense does not win games, it wins
championships. If you don’t believe me, look at the
teams which make the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh has
won it the last three years thanks mainly to its “Steel
Curtain” defense. Dallas has won because of its
‘“Doomsday”’ defense and who can forget Denver and

its “Orange Crush” or Miami and the “No-Name”’
defense?

After only four games this year, a trend has already
set in. The W&L defense, anchored by a front line of
four sophomores and a senior, has been able to hold
its opponent to either one or two’ touchdowns a game.
With a defense capable of allowing only two scores
every four quarters, the Generals can stay close in
every game.

Last Saturday, the front line of sophomores John
Winans, Tom Noble, Dave Nickels, Mike Pressler and
senior Mike Mrlik combined for a total of three fum-
ble recoveries and made life miserable for Macon
running backs all day long. Noble even scored a safe-
ty by tackling the Macon quarterback in his endzone.

But these weren’t the only underclassmen to play a
big part in the game. Freshman kicker Bill Devine
provided W&L’s other six points by booting field goals
of 40 and 28 yards. And in the closing moments of the
game, sophomore quarterback Jim Wenke was taken
out in favor of—you guessed it—another sophomore
quarterback, Rich Hachenburg.

Having a lot of underclassmen starters is nothing
new to a W&L football team. Traditionally, football at
this school has been a sport in which two-year par-
ticipation is normal. Juniors and seniors are hard to
find. But this too seems to be changing.

The reason is simple: Gary Fallon has incorporated
a positive attitude and has also developed a system to
place quality players on the varisty team.

This year, Fallon has started a J.V. football team to
complement the varsity program. The cause of this is
numbers. With an increasing number of freshmen
coming in each year, there simply are not enough
spots for everyone on the varsity.

Instead, Fallon will take those players who would
not see much playing time with the varsity and give
them plenty of game experience with the J.V. team.
After a year or two of J.V. ball, the players will
theoretically be able to play on the varsity level.

Fallon is not the first to use this idea. Verne Can-
field develops his basketball players in the same way.
Freshmen basketball players typically spend a year
or two on the J.V. team in order to learn the Canfield
system of basketball.

Hopefully, Fallon will meet with the same amount
of success as has Canfield. In his first year at W&L,
Fallon went 2-8. In his first year at W&L, Canfield also
won two games (his record that year was 2-17). Two
years later, Canfield’s team was 20-5.

If Gary Fallon’s program matches the success of
Verne Canfield’s, beware of the Generals next year.

Homecoming Highlight:
Lax Alumni Game

 

by Kip Gordon

The fifth annual Alumni-
Varsity lacrosse game is
scheduled for Sunday, October
7, at 11:00 a.m. on Wilson Field.
A popular event among lacrosse
fans, the game provides an en-
joyable look at former W&L
stars, as well as a preview of
the General’s 1980 team.

Head Coach Jack Emmer ex-
pects his squad to perform well
against the alumni, and said,
“‘we’d like to think we can beat
them this year; they’re starting
to get a little too cocky.”’ In-
deed, the veterans have every
reason to be confident, having
won the last three contests in-
cluding last year’s game, 14-13.
The varsity has won only once,
in 1975, taking the series opener
7-4,

The alumni squad this year is
as strong as ever, and features
recent first-team All-
Americans Sam _ Englehart
(’73), Skip Lichtfuss (’74), and
Tom Keigler (’77).

Englehart is best
remembered for his potent
shot—as well as his ability and
desire to use it. He tops the
record books with career totals
in most goals (180) and most
shots (457). He will be joined by
W&L’s all-time leading scorer

Don Carroll (’76), who amassed
229 points.

Dave Warfield (75) will also
be on hand. He was a second-
team All-American and is se-
cond on the W&L scoring list
with 207 points. Rounding out
the attack will be two of last
year’s tri-captains, John Black
and Jeff Fritz, who respectively
occupy the fourth and fifth
places on the scoring list. To
say the least, these five scoring
threats should provide an offen-
sive powerhouse.

Defensively, the alumni are
again more than solid. Keigler,
a skilled stick-handler who was
most notable for his tenacity on
ground balls, will be supporting
Charlie Brown (’78), a second-
team All-American goalie. Jim
Farrar (’74), another defensive
standout, was a third-team All-
American.

Ted Bauer (’74), a three time
first team All-American mid-
die, is unsure about playing. He
currently holds the W&L record
for most assists in a game with
seven, and if he shows he will
join mid-fielders Jack Dudley
(77), Doug Fuge (’78), Charlie
Steiff (78), and ’79 tri-captain
Sandy McDonald.

Also playing will be a fair
number of vintage talent. Bill

Clements (50), W&L’s first
first-team All-American at
goalie, will be opposing his son,
Bob Clements, himself a
second-team All-American
goalie and co-captain of this
year’s team. It is the only
father-son confrontation in the
game’s history.

Jim Lewis (58), another first
team All-American, completes
the list of netminders. It is said
that Jim played without a chest
protector in order to quicken his
reflexes. But it is more than
likely that Jim will don one for
the upcoming contest.

Jim Perryman (’54) is still
active in lacrosse, playing for a
club team in Texas. His son is
currently a freshman lacrosse
player at W&L.

The amount of talent and ex-
perience which the varsity
Generals will face must certain-
ly offer a bleak outlook for the
game. Yet the fact remains that
the Generals have lost only
three players to graduation,
and thus have an experienced
roster. Nevertheless, the 24 var-
sity members returning from
last year’s squad will be, in
fact, pitted against veritable
legends who will certainly hold
a psychological, if not physical,
edge in the upcoming contest.

 

Tennis

The W&L fall tennis team
opened up its 1979 fall campaign
by taking sixth place in the
Navy Fall Invitational played
last weekend. Despite the sixth-
place finish (host Navy swept
the top team honors), Coach
Gary Franke termed it ‘‘a good
tournament for us,” noting that
W&L was competing with five
Division I schools and Division
III power, Swarthmore.

Freshman Steve Denny from

 

Team Takes 6th

Bethesda, Md. turned in the top
individual performance as he
won two matches in the ‘“‘C”’
division before bowing 6-0, 6-1 to
his Navy foe. Winning first-
round matches were All-
American Steward Jackson,
Peter Lovell, and the doubles
team of Lovell and Doug Gaker.

Franke explains that the fall
season gives the freshman
players a chance to establish
themselves in the program and

all players an opportunity to
win positions by playing
“challenge matches.” Six to
eight Generals will earn varsity
berths while the remainder of
the 21-man squad will play on
the JV team.

The W&L netmen will again
be in action this weekend at the
James Madison Tournament in
Harrisonburg. Other _ partic-
cipating teams are James
Madison, George Mason, and
Richmond.

General Mark Turner injured his leg, but it did not stop W&L. A
late second half goal enabled the Generals to upset Eastern

Mennonite.

Booters Win 1-0

by Chris Sisto

The varsity soccer team
evened its overall record at 2-2
last Saturday with a 1-0 win
over Eastern Mennonite.

Late in the second half,
W&L’s Mark Turner was il-
legally taken out of the play by
a Mennonite player within 18
feet of the opposing goal. This
gave the Generals a penalty
kick with 20 minutes left in the
contest. Brian Williams
capatilized on the opportunity
to score the only goal of the
game.

W&L coach Rolf Piranian
praised everyone on the team
for the win, but gave special
notice to the defense. He ex-
plained, ‘‘It was a total team ef-
fort, but the defense really
sparked us. Our defenders beat
Mennonite to the ball
throughout the entire game.”’

This strong defensive effort
accounted for the offense hav-
ing several opportunities to
score. In the first half, the

Generals outshot their op-
ponents 13-7. Scoring chances
by Mark Turner and Bill Brown
were stopped by the Mennonite
defense.

In the second half, the
Generals continued their
physical style of play and solid
defense until they scored their
goal. Following the goal, the
Generals played conservatively
as Piranian used his ‘‘prevent
defense” to stall for the win.
Goalie Kevin Carney saved the
win in the last few minutes
when he stopped several scor-
ing bids by Mennonite.

Piranian was happy about the
win and said, ‘I am very pleas-
ed with the way we played to-
day. The team is starting to put
things together now. Also, this
gives us our second ODAC con-
ference victory against no
defeats.”’

W&L tri-captain, Doug Seitz,
played superbly on defense and
was named W&L’s player of the
game,

The W&L water polo team got
off to an extremely successful
start of their 1979 season last
weekend, coming up with three
wins in three games at the
Johns Hopkins Invitational
Tournament.

Coach Page Remillard was
very pleased with his team’s
performance, citing excellent
defensive play by the entire
squad as instrumental in the
wins.

The Generals started off slow-
ly in their first game, falling
behind 3-1 against Johns
Hopkins at the half. But W&L
stuck to its game plan, and
came back to score six goals in
the second half whild holding
the Blue Jays scoreless. The
final score of the initial game
was W&L7, Johns Hopkins 3.

In their second game, W&L
was matched against the Naval
Academy. On the previous day,
Navy had played Johns
Hopkins, giving the Generals a
fine opportunity to scout the op-
position.

Relying on a ‘“‘tight, ag-
gressive man-to-man defense,”
the Generals were able to stifle
Navy’s superior outside
shooting and take an im-
pressive 12-3 victory.

W&L’s third and final game of
the tournament was a rematch
against the Johns Hopkins team
they had defeated on the
previous day. The Generals
again won the game, but in
what Remillard called ‘‘a slug-
gish, anticlimactic victory.”

Part of the reason for the ap-
parent lackluster play during
the contest was that the game
was played only one half hour
after the victory over Navy.
The final 7-4 win gave the
Generals first place in the tour-
nament.

Commenting on the tourna-
ment, Remillard made it very

23 South Main Street

 

The Ring-tum Phi, October 4, 1979, Page 11

Water Polo
Undefeated

clear that he was pleased.
‘“We’re right about where I
would have hoped we would
be,”’ said the coach.

He also noted that there is
much improvement to be made
if the team is to become a con-
tender for the Southern League
championship. Specifically, he
said, improvement must come
in being able to ‘‘read’’ op-
ponents and identify what they
are attempting to do.

Another area which demands
improvement is that of “‘man
advantage”’ situations, which
are the equivalent of power
plays in hockey. The Generals
scored on only three of 11 such
opportunities. This figure
should be closer to 50 or 60 per-
cent.

Standout individuals in the
tournament included co-captain
Biff Martin who led the
Generals in scoring with 11 of
their 26 goals, and Bob
Newcomb, who played
“outstanding defense’ and had
four goals. Both were praised
by their coach.

But the player who was the
key to all three W&L victories
was goalie Will Hodges. Says
Remillard: ‘“‘That was the key
to our success—tough defense
in the field and Will’s closing off
everything else that they shot.”

Hodges had 23 blocks, and he
allowed ten goals for a .696
block percentage. According to
Remillard, anything over .500 is
respectable for a water polo
goalie.

Hodges prefers to credit his
defense with his success.
“When the defense plays as
tight as our defense played, it’s
much easier to make the

Duck

Season
Opens

by Jim Feinman

Area hunters have a chance
to cash in on early migrations of
wood ducks and teal this week
with the early duck season in
Virginia which opened Wednes-
day. The October 3-6 season is
specifically designed to give
waterfowlers an opportunity to
bag certain species of birds that
will normally have passed
through the area when the
regular season begins
November 20.

The daily limit for ducks is
based on a 100-point system that
assigns specific values to dif-
ferent species of birds. A hunter
must keep a tally on the com-
bined point value of the ducks
he bags. When the last duck
bagged equals or exceeds 100
points, the hunter has reached
his limit.

 

Ducks that have a 70-point
value are black ducks, hen
mallards, mottled ducks and
hooded megansers. Twenty-
five-point birds are wood ducks
and drake mallards. Blue and
green winged teal, pintail, gad-
wall and widgeon have a 10-
point value.

The James and Maury rivers
should have large populations
of wood ducks and perhaps a
few mallards and_ blacks.
However, high water from the
heavier-than-usual rains will
hamper much of the gunning on
these rivers. Smaller streams
in the area might be the best bet
for local hunters. Careful stalk-
ing along the banks could pro-
vide good jump-shooting with a
more than reasonable chance of
retrieving fallen game.

A special duck stamp is need-
ed in addition to a Virginia hun-
ting license to hunt waterfowl.
Stamps are available at the post
office.

Squirrel season opened in
Rockbridge County on October
1 and will run through October
13. The season will open again
on November 12 and continue
through January 31. The limit
will be six squirrels per day.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK T otters To The Editor

Alumni Banished From Fancy Dress

kditorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Pr.

The Budget Hearings

The blood is on the floor after the Executive Com-
mittee’s record five and a half hour budget hearing
Tuesday night. Although last year’s budget meeting
lasted just under four and a half hours, most student
committee’s got amounts close to the sums they ask-
ed for. This year the deadly combination punch of in-
flation and fewer student bodies (and, hense, less
money) resulted in a smaller pie for all the student
organizations to share.

The process was in many ways similar to cutting
the head and feet off a person to make him fit a
smaller bed. The Student Activities Board took it on
the chin, with their budget being slashed by $10,000.
The law school walked away with close to a $1,000 less
this year than last year’s take. Actually, we came out
of the hearing in pretty good shape and we’re very
greatful. The whole process made it very evident that
the student tax will have to be raised at least $5 next
year just to keep up with inflation.

But that’s enough about the budget hearing for now.
We'll tell you what we really thought about it next
week—after we’ve gotten our money.

Enough Is Enough

First there was Hurricane David. Then we were hit
by Hurricane Frederick. The two combined to bring
us one of the wettest Septembers in the history of the
region, and October has not shown much promise for
letting us dry out.

So we urge the powers that be to end this damp
weather. The sun hasn’t been out for so long that
we’ ve almost forgotten what it is like to be warmed by
the sun’s rays. And these hurricane-flash-flood
downpours have simply got to stop—before the entire
town washes away.

And as long as we are on this subject, why is it hur-
ricanes are now named after men? The unpredictable
nature of hurricanes makes it more appropriate that
they be named after women.

Taking Issue

I really must take issue with
myself concerning last week’s
article. I just don’t know what
got into me. Imagine, referring
to females as objects solely of
desire and lust. Surely, such a
point of view is both warped and
somewhat fearful to behold.

Because we exist in an all-
male environment, with in-
creasingly shrinking social op-
portunities, it is difficult to
understand the female _per-
sonality. Misconceptions arise
from the lack of both com-
munication and sympathetic in-
terpretaton. Too often, it is easy
to draw a_ depreciating
generalization concerning the
opposite sex.

Alleged ‘‘free’’ parties at
neighboring girls’ schools
which deteriorate into expen-
sive displays of affectionate in-
terest might be viewed as
unreasonable stinginess on the

part of people with enough
plastic credit to buy all of
Rockbridge County. Lime green
or pink ensembles with mat-
ching hair bands, skirts, shoes,
and purse might be seen as ex-
cessive bad taste, or vanity,
depending on one’s degree of
color sensitivity. Total devotion
to soul music while harboring
deep-seated unacknowledged
prejudices could be
misconstrued as shallowness.

The opportunities for
misconception, then, are many
and varied. Only by constantly
realizing that we are dealing
with very nice people with very.
nice parents can the urge for
dehumanizing stereotyping, of
which the “piece of meat”’ view-
point might be one of the more
flattering, be avoided.

Of course, someone, certainly
not me, might point out that
some of the same things could
be said about us.

Vepco Has Bad Nuclear Safety Record

A. Robert Smith

Norfolk—If Virginia Electric and
Power Company, the most heavily fined
utility in the nation for nuclear safety
violations, were in traffic court with its
record, it would have its license suspend-
ed for recklessness, be sent to driver-
education school, and be tested for com-
petence before being reinstated.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has repeatedly cited Vepco for with-
holding information or providing mis-
leading information, for weakensses in
its security system, for design and con-
struction inadequacies as its Surry and
North Anna nuclear plants, and for fail-
ing to follow required procedures for
guarding workers against radiation.

Mr. Smith is associate editor of the Nor-
folk Virginia Pilot.

 

Fines against the Virginia utility have
been levied on five occasions since 1973,
most recently a $15,000 penalty in
August, for a_ not-so-grand total of
$127,400. Only Consolidated Edison of
New York, with seven fines totaling
$105,000, is in the same league as a per-
sistent offender of federal nuclear safety
regualtions.

When questioned about this dubious
distinction, Vepco President Stanely
Ragone claimed that ‘anti-nuclear
forces and disgruntled employees have
probably caused Surry to be inspected
more than any other plant in the country.
It’s like an audit. The more you audit, the
more you find.”’

That’s rather like saying Virginia’s
auto inspectors find many safety viola-
tions because they inspect autos too
often.

If it isn’t the freaks and inspectors, it’s
the bureaucrats. In 1976 when the NRC
fined Vepco $32,500 for making false
statements about its North Anna plant,
Ragone claims that a high NRC official
‘told me they had to start showing they
were cracking down on people, and they
needed an appropriation. That was the
reason (that Vepco was punished).”’

If such bureaucratic gamesmanship
was a factor in penalizing the utility, it
reveals something about the govern-
ment’s past permissiveness with nuclear
power development rather than an un-
warranted crackdown on Vepco.

Growing public concern about nuclear
safety induced President Ford and Con-
gress in 1974 to abolish the Atomic
Energy Commission because it was both
promoting and trying to regulate nuclear
expansion. If the NRC felt compelled to
show that it was putting safety first, it
was only because the public and Cngress
thought a tough appraoch was overdue.
Whether the NRC has in fact been strict
enough is a question for the president’s
Three Mile Island Commission to con-
sider.

Federal inspectors fault nuclear plants
for all sorts of infractions, but only the
most severe or repeated violations result
in fines. Of the 48 public and privately
owned utilities licensed to operate nu-
clear plants, only 18 have ever been fin-

No Prosecution

ed. Either the other 30 have relatively
clean records or the NRC is still not a
tough cop.

But do utility fines have a useful ef-

 

fect? As a practical matter, such sums
can be paid from a giant utility’s petty
cash fund. And in Vepco’s case, company
officials seem more intent on justifying
infranctions than promising safer prac-
tices.

If there is any way of scolding a utility
into doing better, it is to force it to shut
down an unsafe plant. Most of Vepco’s re-
actors are currently shut down for modi-
fications required by the NRC, causing
the company to buy more expensive elec-
tricity from other sources. It has, of
course, applied for stiff rate increases, so
it is the consumers—not management or
the stockholders—who get stuck with
paying for its mistakes.

Instead of levying fines, the NRC

More Letters To

might do better with a point system. Like
moving violations by motorists, serious
and repeated violations can be assumed
to indicate careless, if not reckless,
management that threatens public safe-
ty. Upon receiving a dozen points, the
utility would have to shut down all its
nuclear plants until it has persuaded the
NRC that its management is_trust-
worthy.

Moreover, any extra expenses incur-
red by such an order should be absorbed
by the company and its stockholders, not
passed onto ratepayers. If dividends are
cut because management fails to obey
safety rules, stockholders will have an in-
centive to insist on safe, not just pro-
fitable, management practices.

Utilities became used to being coddled
by the AEC when nuclear plants were
considered costly and experimental. To-
day Vepco justifies its tilt toward nuclear
plants by saying they are less expensive
than oil or coal plants to operate. That
means that rising fossil-fuel costs give
the utilities greater incentive to keep
their reactors on line.

But the mechanism for forcing the in-
dustry to observe public-safety rules is
faulty. Modest fines for violations are
easily paid, and expensive shutdowns for
safety-inspired modifications are charg-
ed to rate-payers. A point system carry-
ing the risk of loss of operating permits
would strengthen the NRC’s hand.

It that seems drastic, consider the
alternatives. Better a shutdown than a
meltdown.

Really Now, Who Cares?

Dear Editor,

Student apathy on campus is
at an all-time high in my opi-
nion. This assertion is sup-
ported by the lack of student
participation at Sunday’s Stu-
dent Activities Board meeting.
The decision to ban alumni
from the Fancy Dress Ball is

obviously a controversial issue,
but fewer than 15 students
bothered to attend.

I could carry on a lengthy
dissertation concerning — this
matter but I don’t feel like it
right now.

Sincerely,
Who Cares?

Sing-A-Longs On Sundays

I'd like very much to make a
suggestion. I guess everyone
has their own causes that they
would like to further. Mine is
singing—traditional, old-
fashioned ‘‘sing-a-longs’’.

When I grew up (I’m now 50)
we had our “‘now’”’ songs just as
today—but
somehow, we were taught songs
of former days as well. We all
knew World War I songs as well
as songs of the West, Civil War
songs, World War II songs,
“gay ninety” songs.

Music, I think everyone will
agree, is a very important,
vital, and representative ex-
pression of the times.
Nowadays, no effort is being
made to keep the old songs
alive. Every year they are be-
ing buried a little deeper. The
beautiful songs of Stephen
Foster!! Those heart breaking
songs of the Civil War...such
songs as “There’ll be Blue
Birds over the White Cliffs of
Dover’’...They are, in essence,
ballads telling of current
events.

My suggestion is this! — Why
not have—on a regular basis a
“‘sing-a-long”’ of traditional old
songs on Sunday evenings in
front of Lee Chapel? Students
could lounge around on the
campus under the trees—

listening and singing. The lights
from the Colonnade and Lee’s
Chapel (which are on anyway)
would be ample light. Music
students could perform! Solo
violin or flute!! How perfectly
hauntingly beautiful it would be
to have such music in that set-
ting!

V.M.I. offers its parade for
public entertainment. These
evenings of informal, tradi-
tional music could be W&L’s
counterpart—and most ap-
propriate for an educational in-
stitution.

It could be so easily started,
too. Just get as few as ten peo-
ple together who like to sing and
put a notice on the bulletin

board announcing the time. The
just couple of times it might be
poorly attended—but so what?
The sessions could end with a
lovely old hymn such as ‘‘Now
The Day Is Over.”’ (Even the
old hymns are not being sung
like they used to. It seems to me
that whenever I go to church,
they rarely sing the ‘‘old
faithfuls” any more).

It would just take a little in-
itiative on the part of one person
who reads this letter to get this
idea started. I hope that ‘‘one
person”’ reads this letter.

Whither The Gentlemen

Sir:

I have one question. Where
are the gentlemen of
Washington and Lee? It certain-
ly was not a gentleman who
broke my Baker dormitory win-
dow Friday afternoon without a
note of apology. It could not
have been.

A gentleman would have had
the intelligence to read the
regulations concerning games
in the quad (they are pro-
hibited), the sense to follow the

regulations, and the courtesy to
at least leave a note of apology
for the damage and inconven-
ience caused.

This letter is not meant to in-
sult the gentlemen who must be
on campus somewhere, only the
cowards who, by their in-
considerate and_ infantile
behavior, disgrace the reputa-
tion of the University and the
student body.

Even More Letters To The Editor

Prof. Decries ‘Murky Moralism’ EC Rep Defends Newspaper

Dear Sir:

I was shocked and sadly disappointed
in reading your most recent issue of the
Ring-tum Phi. It started out okay with a
pleasant (but meaningless) photograph
of the Colonnade and four solid news
stories on the front page, but then
noticeably disintegrated throughout the
next twelve pages.

Page two had one more news story,
another photograph with no accompany-
ing article and a letter that was con-
tinued from page 10—hardly consecutive
and logical reading. I realize layout pro-
blems and deadlines are hard to deal
with, buy my real concern was with the
quality of material and writing that I
found in the rest of the paper.

Page three had a cynical story of boy

conquers girl in the guise of a
‘“‘Reporter’s Probing Investigation.’’ The
least that can be said is that it was fairly
well written, but I found myself wonder-
ing why it had been written at all. There
seems to be a policy in your paper this
year of introducing humor in the form of
sexually exploitive articles. The one on
page three was fairly mild compared to
the unsigned article ‘Success with
Women” on the editorial page. Was it on-
ly my perception or was there some sub-
conscious motivation in placing this
sophomoric hymn to the double standard
next to Parker Potter’s thoughtful piece
on Sen. John Warner’s article in Shenan-
doah Magazine.

Mr. Potter’s essay made the point that,
with all his lip service to the W&L ideals
of the code of gentlemen, the honor
system and the great history of this in-
stitution, Sen. Warner had negated these
ideals by the trivial behavior he recalled
as part of his conduct as a W&L student.

EC Vice-President Apologies For‘Inconsiderations

Dear Members of the Publications Board
and Students,

At Monday night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting a letter was filed by the
Publicatons Board President, Ben
Keese, concerning the financing of a cash
advancement to the ‘‘Calyx’’ which I
would like to take the opportunity to ex-
plain to the Student Body.

On Sept. 24, John Hamilton, Business
Manager of the Calyx, requested and
received by a unanimous vote of the E.C.
a $5,000 advancement in order to take ad-
vantage of a 2 percent discount offered
by the contracted publisher of the Calyx.

Realizing the urgency of this request,
as Vice-President I contacted the proper
University official in the Business Office
to seek his advice on the advancement of
this amount in light of the fact that the
Central Student Body Funds had not been
channeled into the various accounts of
student body committees.

It is only after the E.C. has received,
studied, and approved the individual
committees’ budget requests and subse-
quent allocations that the Student Ac-
tivities fees are transferred into the
separate committee accounts.

Since the Vice-President is the
manager of the ‘‘disbursements of stu-
dent body funds, subject to the approval
of the Executive Committee,” I discuss-
ed this advancement, as I had with
previous advancements, with the Univer-
sity official who oversees the accounts of
the Student Body.

After discussing several alternatives,
the advice I received was to divide the
$5,000 advancement two ways: $3,000
coming from the Student Body Reserve
Fund and $2,000 from the Publications
Board Reserve Fund (so as not to deplete

either account below the minimum) with

Where do gentlemen’s codes, the honor '
system and our heritage fit in with an ar-

ticle advocating lying as a best means to
achieve the desired ‘notches on the
belt?”

This murky moralism was even more
graphically demonstrated in your
editorial defending the publication of an
ad for research papers that could be pur-
chased by students and, in violation of all
our ideals, presented as their own work.

You defend yourself by claiming that
you needed the money and commented
that students used this service at their
own risk. Come now. You choose to
publish that ad; you could have refused,
and you certainly could have sought
advertising alternatives to make up the
money you so sorely need. There is no ex-
cuse for offering such a service in the
newspaper published by the students of a
school dedicated to academic excellence
and high ideals of living.

If Mr. Potter pictures General Lee as
spinning like a dervish as a result of
alumni triviality, what is the poor
General doing in response to your asser-
tion that anything is fit to be published—
even articles advocating lying and
cheating—as long as they bring in the re-
quired rewards.

One final comment. The few articles
worth reading in the September 27th,
issue were marred by slopping editing
and proofreading.

I have in the past come to respect the
Ring-tum Phi and the hard working
students who put it together. I find it very
sad to see what it has disintegrated to
this year.

Sincerely,
Pamela H. Simpson

the understanding that the accounting
procedure would reverse itself once the
1979-80 budgeted funds for the Calyx
were properly channeled.

After informing John Hamilton of the
disbursement voucher written on
September 25 deriving the funds as
stated above, it became clear to me as a
theretofore unrealized point of informa-
tion ‘‘that the funds of the Publications
Board are not student funds in the sense
that they are not derived from student
activities fees.”’

In short, by virtue of the advice I
received I was misinformed, not inten-
tionally to be sure but rather, as Mr.
Keese states in his letter, in a matter of
‘“‘a simple oversight’ on the part of the
University official.

However, Mr. Keese’s strongest objec-
tion was of the “Executive Committee’s
failure to notify the Board of its inten-
tions; a failure which is, to say the least,
inconsiderate.”’

This also became quite clear to me
once I was educated to the fact that the
Publications Board Reserve Fund is
totally independent of other student body
funds and does not come under the Vice-
President’s managing of disbursements
of Student Body funds.

Therefore, on the next day, Sept. 26, I
authorized a voucher and transferred the
$2,000 back into the Publications Board
Reserve Fund to correct this oversight.
The Reserve Fund thus returned to its
original balance of September 25.

The Calyx did not receive its entire
$5,000 allocation which will be carried as
a temporary deficit in its account until
the 1979-80 budget is finalized on October
9th.

= es Let me reiterate that the Publications

 

Dear Prof. Simpson:

At last Monday night’s Executive Com-
mittee meeting the editor of this
newspaper came before the E.C. to ask
our feelings about the research paper
advertisement in the Ring-tum Phi.

I am very flattered that the editor

came and inquired as to the students’ opi-
nion on this matter, but the real question

is whether this ad abused the honor
system in anyway. Specifically, he refer-
red to your ‘“‘letter to the editor.”’

You, sharply criticize the newspaper
for many of its articles, and in your letter
you do focus on the research paper
advertisement.

There are two sentences in your letter
which I would like to address. These
sentences are: “This murky moralism
was even more. graphically
demonstrated in your editorial defending
the publication of an ad for research
papers that could be purchased by the
students of a school dedicated to
academic excellence and high ideals of
living.”

These two sentences bother me quite a
bit. Implied in both of these thoughts is
the fact that given the opportunity,
Washington and Lee students will buy a
research paper and try to hand it in as
their own work.

Are you saying, Professor Simpson,
that you do not trust the students at
Washington and Lee? I think you are.

You believe that students are inherent-
ly dishonorable and should not be subject
to such tempting ideas as paying for a
research paper. I believe you are way off
base and should be set straight.

First of all, there are many other uses

Board’s major point of objection—that of
the E.C.’s failure to notify the Board of
its intentions— and the point of informa-
tion concerning the nature of the Publica-
tions Board Reserve Fund are now
unbelievably clear and, moreover, ap-
preciated by me.

I offer my sincerest apologies for any

of this service rather than handing in a
paper as one’s own work. Why can’t
these research papers be used for their
bibliographies?

It is perfectly alright to read an article
in a journal and pick up on its sources to
write a paper. What makes a research
paper from this service so different, or
maybe we shouldn’t read the articles in
journals? Is that what you are saying Dr.
Simpson?

Secondly, why can’t a student just be
interested in a subject and want to read
about it. Is that so hard to believe?

Lastly, what makes you so sure that
sutdents will do as you say? In the Sept.
27 issue of the Ring-tum Phi there was
never any mention of using these
research papers in a fraudulent manner
in the ad itself.

It seems to me that the Ring-tim Phi is
not degrading or immoralizing our com-
munity by running these ads, but rather
you are with your allegations.

What you are saying is that if a student
can buy a research paper and hand it in
as his own, he will. You are dead wrong
Prof. Simpson.

In a community such as ours where
honor is regarded as very important, a
great deal of trust is needed to keep this
atmosphere sustaining.

I do feel sorry for you if you can’t trust
the students more than you say.

Trust is a very great thing to have in
people; you should try it Prof. Simpson, I
guarantee you'll like it.

Freya Members Explain Role

To the editor:

During our traditional walk around the
Hollins campus on September 10th in
honor of the opening of the College, it
became evident that many of the
students visiting Hollins for the evening
did not understand who or what we were.
We realize the disruptive behavior of
many people was due to this lack of
understanding. Therefore, we are
writing you in the hopes that in the future
you can accord us enough respect to let
us walk unhindered.

The name of our organization is Freya,
founded by a group of Hollins women in
1903. It has had varying roles over the
years, but it is now a functional organiza-
tion that deals with the particular pro-
blems and needs within the Hollins com-
munity. The members of Freya remain
anonymous in order to preserve a unified
character. We serve the community
through two funds: the Freya Scholar-
ship Fund and the Freya Emergency
Relief Fund.

Much of what we do for the Hollins
community is behind the scenes and
without any desire for recognition. But to
retain a tangible contact, we walk on
significant occasions, or in order to call

_ attention to an issue or event. When we

walk, we wear black hooded robes to
preserve our anonymity and to promote
the symbol of unity. We also carry
candles as a symbol of hope and faith.
This is a very cursory description of
Freya, but it is sufficient to illustrate to
you how much we are a part of the heart
of Hollins. We welcome you as our guests
and ask only for you to respect our
motives enough to allow us to walk in
peace.
Sincerely,
The Members of Freya,
Hollins College

Health Complaints

Dear Students,

I have recently had an unfortunate ex-
perience at the W&L infirmary. As a
newly appointed member of the Student
Health Committee, I feel that it is my du-
ty to see that similar incidents do not oc-
cur.

Therefore, I would like the cooperation
of the W&L student body in this matter.
Anyone who has had similar experiences
at the infirmary should contact me at
463-7478, Your cooperation in this matter
will be appreciated. Thank You,

Dean Kalamaras

IFC Pledges *350 To Fund

by John Billmyre

The Interfraternity Council
voted unanimously to donate
$350 to the local United Way
Campaign and decided not to
donate kegs for a_ basketball
benefit concert, during a short
meeting Tuesday evening.

While every representative
voted in favor of donating the
$350 collected by the IFC for
rush violations, not one repre-
sentative supported the basket-
ball team’s effort to get free
kegs from the IFC.

The kegs would have been us-
ed at a fund raising concert fea-
turing the Charlottesville
Allstars and Catfish Hodge.

Sentiment was strong against
supporting the basketball team.

“Canfield doesn’t want
basketball players to pledge
fraternities and has threatened
to blacklist those who do,”’ said
one fraternity president, “‘I
don’t see why we should give
him money.”

The fraternity president ask-
ed not to be named because his
fraternity is rushing a potential
basketball player.

Andy DeMuth suggested the
IFC make a_ budget before
donating any more money.

Treasurer Hunt Shuford said
that he will make a budget and
announced that the IFC has
‘about $7,500” in its budget.

Other Business

IFC President Syd Farrar an-
nounced that fraternity house
inspections will be conducted
Friday beginning at C hour.

While no noise ordinance vio-
lations were brought up, Farrar
reported that three professors
living in the faculty apartments
had complained about the noise
following parties.

Farrar advised Phi Kappa
Psi, Lambda Chi, Zeta Beta Tau
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon to
make less noise after parties.

Representatives were also
urged to contact any interested

faculty members about serving
as a faculty adviser to the IFC.

Nominations for the represen-
tative position will be taken at
the next IFC meeting on Oct. 16.

The judicial board heard two
cases following the regular
meeting.

Pi Kappa Alpha was fined $25
for returning pledges to the
freshman quad late after the
first rush date.

Phi Gamma Delta was fined
$25 for parking a car loaded
with freshmen in the quad be-
tween rush dates three and four
and for ungentlemanly conduct.

Students and fraternities that cook some or all
of their meals might be interested in opening
charge accounts at the White Front Super-
market. AT the end of each month, the bill can be
sent to your parents, your Lexington address, or
fraternity house. Written permission from a
parent is necessary for students under twenty-
one. Obviously a grocery bill sent home will
leave more money in your own bank account.

Riegel
Surveys
Hungarian

Film

O. W. Riegel, professor
emeritus of journalism at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, is the author of a major
survey of Hungarian film
history, “The Reflective Eye:
Hungarian Cinema,” published
in the recent edition of Osiris, a
magazine which includes both
French and English works in
poetry and prose.

 

A W&L teacher since 1930,
Riegel was head of the depart-
ment of journalism and com-
munications for 34 years. He
came to Washington and Lee
after working for newspapers in
Wisconsin, New York and
Paris.

During his 43 years at the
university he remained a prin-
cipal authority in the field of
propaganda and the media. His
classic work, ‘Mobilizing for
Chaos: The Story of the New
Propaganda,”’ was originally
published in 1934, but its
significance was lasting enough
for it to be called back into print
in 1972 by the New York Times’
book-publishing division.

Party Ban
Leads To

Violence

Plymouth, N.H.—A ban on
keg beer parties at Plymouth
State College prompted a
violent outburst Sunday in
which about 750 students and
visitors threw rocks and bottles
at police before they were sub-
dued by the spray from
firehoses.

A lamp post was torn down
and a number of windows were
broken in buildings near the
campus in the small central
New Hampshire town during
the five-hour long confrontation
while the students chanted,
‘“‘We want kegs! We Want kegs!

Six persons were arrested as
a result of the demonstration
which sent one fireman to the
hospital and injured several
others.

“This is the most destructive
thing I have ever seen,” said
the college’s president, Casper
Marking. Marking said the col-
lege had initiated the ban
against keg beer parties after
New Hampshire raised the
legal drinking age for all
alcoholic beverages from 18 to
20 earlier this year.

year. About 15 members of SAE
and some other students were
throwing sugar packets and be-
ing rowdy.

Although Constine said he has
no complaints with the final
decisions of the boards, some
members of the fraternity feel
they were dealt with too harsh-
ly, pointing out that the incident
occurred before school started
and was in no way a fraternity
function,-and that there were
also members of other frater-
nities present.

‘It should have gone before
Student Control,’ said one
member.

The IFC passes judgment on
all cases involving complaints
against fraternities. Its decision
is subject to automatic review
by SAC, a committee made up
of five students and five faculty
members.

Presently, the members of
SAC are: Syd Farrar, president
of the IFC; Steve Abraham,
president of the student body;
Tim Brooks, head of the Student
Control Committee; Danny
Carucci, head dorm counselor;
and Bill Garrett, president of
the Student Bar Association.
The faculty members are:
Dean of Students Lewis John,
who is chairman of SAC; Assis-
tant Dean of Students H. Robert
Huntley; and professors Gary
Dobbs, Nancy Margand, and
John Merchant. Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Murphy sits on
the board in cases of absence of
a faculty member.

Student Control cases can be
reviewed by SAC either at a stu-
dent’s appeal or when there are
two or more dissenting votes.

A SAC decision can be appeal-
ed to the University Council,
who will set up a seven member
appeal board to hear the case.
