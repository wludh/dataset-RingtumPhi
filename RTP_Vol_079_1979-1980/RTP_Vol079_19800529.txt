103 Law Degrees

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity awarded law degrees to 103
men and women Sunday, and in
his commencement - address,
President Huntley cautioned
them to be conscious of the
urgent need to strike a balance
between the extremes of view-
ing the system of laws as a
machine, on the one hand, and
giving in wholly to emotion and
instinct, on the other.

The law ceremony took place
in Lee Chapel, instead of on the
front lawn because of intermit-
tent showers throughout the
day.

President Huntley told the
graduates and the standing-
room-only audience of families
and friends: ‘“The most impor-
tant thing lawyers do is think.
Lawyers are paid to think,
because they seem to be better
at thinking than most others
are. They are expected to be
able to think effectively about
almost any subject and not just
about purely legal matters, if
indeed there are any purely
legal matters...

“The very best lawyer,’’ he
said,”’ is one who lives the life of
the mind in a practical world
—a life of reason,”’

He noted the 19th-century
Scottish philosopher Thomas
Carlyle’s attack on
mechanism: ‘‘‘All is by rule and
calculated contrivance,’ and
literature, religion, the arts,

and even government become
corrupted by a neglect ot the
‘moral, religious and spiritual
condition of people.’”’

Huntley warned .the new
lawyers ‘‘the kind of
Mechanistic thinking Carlyle
attacks is one of the gravest
risks to be encountered in the
process of ‘thinking like a
lawyer.!”’

But the other extreme,
Huntley said — “to replace
(Mechanism) with a reverence
for emotion and instinct’ — is
likely to lead to just as severe a
deterioration of the fabric of
society. The ‘‘cults’’ that pro-
liferated in recent years
“provide adequate examples,”’
he said, of excess in ‘reaction
against the intellect, reaction
against the life of reason.”’

Huntley told the law
graduates their challenge must
be ‘‘to continue to sharpen those
disciplines of thought to which
your legal education has at
least introduced you...

“It is perilously dangerous
—and dehumanizing,’’ he said,
‘‘to allow the intellect to avoid
confrontation with the profound
values that give meaning to life.

‘Tf there is no reason, no
possibility of truth, no justice
—then law is reduced to an ab-
surd effort, ‘full,’ in Macbeth’s
phrase, ‘of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.’”’

EC Discusses Honor

by John Billmyre
The Executive Committee

ii held its final meeting of the

year Monday night and the ma-

| jor topic of discussion was the

Honor System.

“Law School students in
general don’t take the honor
system seriously,’ said First
Year Law Representative Sam
Allen.

He said that first-year law
students do not learn about the
honor system during orienta-
tion.

‘‘Neal Brickman was suppos-
ed to tell us about the honor
system during orientation, and
he told us not to worry about the
honor system,”’ Allen said.

Brickman was a represen-
tative for the first-year law
students last year, after the
original law _ representative
resigned.

Allen’s comments followed
the EC’s report on honor trials
and investigations during the
year.

EC President Steve Abraham
announced that there were 33
investigations into possible
honor violations this year which

Code

resulted in 15 honor hearings.

Three students withdrew
upon being informed of their
honor hearing.

Another three students were
convicted of honor violations
and two students went public
with their honor hearings.

And 12 students who had
honor trials were acquitted.

Abraham said some cases
may have involved more than
one student and that the figures
are still subject to change. The
EC met in Executive Session

after the regular meeting. Ex-
ecutive Sessions are held in
order to discuss matters of
honor. ;

The three-year EC member
and present EC president also
praised this year’s EC in his
closing comments for the year.

‘It has been an honor for me
to serve on this committee and
this is the best EC that I have
seen in three years,” said
Abraham.

Rinp- Phi investigntive Sorics

Drunk Driving

by W. Cope Moyers and John G. Billmyre

It is late Saturday night and you know you’ve
had one too many beers. Unfortunately, so does
the cop who just pulled your car over.

It is not hard for a police officer on patrol to spot
a drunk driver, according to Virginia State
Trooper J. L. Hines.

‘We always look for the probably cause, such as
weaving and excessive speed,’’ said Hines.

“But sometimes we don’t know we have one un-
til he’s stopped,’’ Hines added.

Once you become one of the unlucky ones pulled
over Hines said his next step is to actually deter-
mine how drunk you really are. .

As you step from the car, the police officer will
make mental notes of the condition of your eyes,
how you get out of the car and what you smell like.

If the officer has reason to believe you’ve done a
little too much partying, he will next give you the
‘‘Roadside Test’.

You are asked to breath into a balloon attached
to a glass vial filled with chemicals. The more
you’ve had to drink, the greener the chemicals will
turn.

‘The test aids the officer in determining to what
extent the subject has been drinking,’’ Hines said.

If you refuse to submit to the test, the fact can-
not be used in court, according to Hines.

But there are several other ‘‘on the spot”’ tests
the officer can administer.

You may be asked to walk a straight line or

touch your nose, actions that are difficult when
you've had too much to drink.

By this time, the officer has established you
have had just a little too much to drink and places
you under arrest. :

Next it’s off to the police station, where things
get complicated.

On the way to the station, the officer is required
to inform you of your rights and of the “Implied
Consent Law.”

This law states that by the mere act of driving in
Virginia, you are automatically required to take a
brethalyzer or blood test, tests that don’t lie.

Either test must be administered by a certified
person, sometimes another police officer but
usually the local magistrate. The blood test can
only be given at the hospital.

And you can’t give the tests to yourself; it takes
four hours of intensive studying before one is cer-
tified.

You can refuse to take either test and a lot of
people do in fact say no when it’s time for the test.
But if you do, be prepared to suffer the conse-
quences.

Not only are you charged with driving under the
influence, but you also pick-up a failure to take a
blood or bretherlyzer test charge. The charge car-
ries a fine and 90 day suspension of your drivers
license. (see side bar )

World Premier Of —

 

Ramdoolal Dey March

One of the most unusual
events of the weekend at
Washington and Lee, or
perhaps of the decade, was the
world premiere of the ‘“‘Ram-
doolal Dey March’ — an
original composition by Dennis
Burnside, a professional com-
poser, conductor and arranger,
written in honor of the 19th-
century owner of the George

Washington portrait was.
presented to W&L last weekend.

The ‘‘Ramdoolal Dey March”’
was featured in a 15-minute
multi-media presentation
shown Friday night to the W&L
board of trustees and special
guests of honor who were on
hand for the dedication of the
university’s $9-million
undergraduate library and the
simultaneous presentation of
the circa-1796 portrait of
Washington.

Burnside is affiliated with
Odyssey. Productions in
Nashville, and his recent
credits range from ‘Macho
Duck,”’ a disco Donald Duck

recording from Disney Studios,
through country-and-western
music, to the new recording of
Aaron Copland’s ‘‘Appalachian
Suite’’ released by National
Geographic, for which Burnside
was orchestra conductor.

The music and_ technical
work, including productions of

_the “Ramdoolal Dey March”

and a series of variations on the
familiar ‘‘Washington and Lee
Swing’’ in the styles of the 18th
and 19th centuries also arrang-
ed by Burnside, are a gift to
W&L from Odyssey through
Paul Whitehead, a partner in
the studio who himself produc-
ed the new W&L musical ex-
travaganza.

Whitehead is the son of W&L’s
board secretary, James W.
Whitehead, and Mrs.
Whitehead.

In addition to his board
responsibilities, James
Whitehead is also the curator of
W&L’s art collections, to which
the Ramdoolal Dey portrait of
Washington has now been add-
ed.

The newly donated portrait,
painted about 1796, toward the
end of Washington’s life, spent
163 years not in American but in
India.

It had been given in 1801 as a
mark of ‘‘esteem and affection’’
to a self-made Hindu multi-
millionaire, Ramdoolal Dey, by
a group of influential American
ship captains and merchants
whom Ramdoolal had befriend-
ed and supported in the very
first years of America’s inter-
national trade following in-
dependence.

His friends whom he had
helped to wealth decided to pre-
sent him with a_ uniquely
American gift in thanks — and

English Dept Selects
Mahan Award Winners

by John Wells

The English Department has
announced four recipients of the
Mahan Awards in Creative
Writing for this year. The
poetry prize was given to Jack
Sharman, and three fiction
prizes were awarded to Steve
McCabe, Palmore Clarke and
James Leva.

Among the oldest continuous
student prizes awarded annual-
ly, the Mahan awards were
established under the will of
George A. Mahan of Hannibal,
Missouri, a ‘‘Lee student,’’ who
died in 1936.

There are four awards of $150
each for prose entries from
freshmen, sophomores, juniors
and seniors and one prize of $200
for a poetry entry from an
undergraduate. The awards
will be officially announced dur-
ing the commencement pro-
gram on June 5.

All entries must ascribe to a
strict set of guidelines handed
down by the English Depart-
ment. Limits are placed on the
number of entries made and no
student may win a class award
and a verse award in the same
year.

In announcing the winners,
the judging committee com-

mented on the work of the in-
dividual recipients.

Of Jack Sharman, who won
the poetry prize: “‘Abstract and
moving, Sharman’s poetry
brings together images from
earlier lines into quiet resolu-
tions in which the words have
almost physical weight and
presence. In The Aching Rib,
his prize-winning sequence of
three . poems, Sharman lifts
hedonism into plangent rhap-
sody.”’

Of Steve McCabe, a fiction
winner: ‘‘McCabe’s prose in
‘The Praying Mantis’ and ‘The
Angelus’ is carefully wrought
and slow with the small in-
crements and shifts in con-
sciousness by which the mind
comes to know the world, mo-
ment by moment. The effect is
calming. McCabe has a rare
ability to make small, slow ef-
fects feel large, timeless and
complete.’’

Of Palmore Clarke, a fiction
winner: ‘Clarke experiments
with stream of consciousness
techniques to generate a
coherent interior monologue, an
undifferentiated and
understated mental narrative
convincingly punctuated by the

\4 W&L Receives Portrait

Winstanley which has noe been
given to W&L by the Warner
Foundation.

The painting was eventually
sold to another Indian by Ram-
doolal’s grandson, and it re-
mained in Calcutta until 1963,
when it was purchased by a
Czech-born American, Erick
Kauders of Marblehead, Mass.

The Warner Foundation pur-
chased it this spring specifical-
ly for Washington and Lee.

The portrait joins two other
important early works of
George Washington art in
W&L’s collections that are of
exceptional value -— Charles
Willson Peale’s priceless 1772
portrait of Washington in the
uniform of a colonel in the
Virginia militia, the first pain-
ting ever made of Washington
from life, and an_ original
Gilbert Stuart portrait in his
famed Athanaeum style.

Cornett

Coleman

P. Craig Cornett, who will
receive his B.A. degree this
week from Washington and Lee
University with majors both in
politics and in economics, will
join the university administra-
tion for a year as assistant
director of publications and
assistant director of the news
office.

Cornett was co-chairman of
the Washington and Lee student
body’s Mock Republican Con-
vention last month and is one of
17 Fellows of the Center for the
Study of the Presidency. He was
elected to membership in
Omicron Delta Kappa, the na-
tional campus leadership socie-
ty, in his junior year and is vice
president of the founding
chapter of ODK this year. He is
one of two student represen-
tatives on the Faculty Commit-
tee on Courses and Degrees.

He joins the university ad-
ministration under a program
that brings a new graduate into
the publications and news
operations for a year at a time
in order to bring that particular
perspective to W&L’s com-
munications activities.

Cornett will be a regular con-
tributor to the W&L Alumni
Magazine and editor of the
university’s Weekly Calendar.
He will also have considerable
responsibility for preparing
news releases.

He succeeds M. Gray Col-
eman II, a 1979 graduate, who
will leave the position at the end
of the month. Coleman will
enter the University of
Virginia’s law school this fall.

Although it is against the law to refuse a blood or
breathalyzer test in Virginia, the chances of ever
being found guilty of non-compliance appear to be
slim.

By agreeing to enroll in the Alcohol Safety Ac-
tion Program, Rockbridge County District Court
Judge Joseph E. Hess will often reduce the drunk
driving charge to reckless driving, and dismiss
the failure to take the test charge.

As a result, the defendant pays a smaller fine
than the one imposed if a person were found guilty
of driving under the influence. The lesser charge
also means the operators license is not revoked.

The Alcohol Safety Action Program in
Rockbridge County is the only one of its kind in
rural Virginia. When the Virginia program was
begun in 1975 in Fairfax, it was intended for areas
with 50,000 people or more. Since Rockbridge
County only has 32,000 people, it was not eligible
for the program.

In 1977, however, a ‘‘test’’ program was in-
itiated in Buena Vista and the number of those ar-
rested a second time for DUI after completion of
the course is low.

‘For the 1978 classes, we had 261 people and of
these there have been only five who were arrested
again for DUI,” said Dr. Robert P. Varley, direc-
tor of the Rockbridge County ASAP program.

Varley said the Governor’s Report of 1979 in-
dicates this county has one of the highest rates of
alcoholism in the southwest area of Virginia.

Buena Vista and Lexington rate 10 and 11 as the
communities with the greatest percentage of

_ alcoholism and third and fourth in percentage of

mortaility rates from alcohol abuse, said Varley.

The rural population presents unusual dif-
ficulties for the four-man staff.

“Very often, about 20 percent of the class cannot
read or write,’’ said Varley.

“Since some of the people are illiterate, we try
to use films and discussion in the classroom,” he
added.

Varley also said there are usually three or four
W&L and VMI students in each class of 20, making
it necessary to alter some classes.

During the last class, three W&L students were
given private showing of a scheduled film because
they wanted to go home for Spring Break, accor-
ding to Varley.

Although the program is successful, Varley said
Lexington has not thrown its entire support behind
the project.

“According to the next Lexington budget, the
ABC store will be giving $31,000 in revenue to the
City of Lexington,”’ Varley said.

“If they are going to get money from the people
who cause alcoholism, they should turn some of
that money over to us,’’ he added.

City Councilman Larry Mann, contacted at his
office, said he was not sure why the ASAP pro-
gram was not getting more money from the city,
but added that Varley had an opportunity to go to
the council and request more money.

Mann added that he does not remember Varley
reappearing before the council giving reason why
ASAP should receive more money from Lex-
ington.

Mann told a Phi reporter that he is more than
willing to listen to requests from the ASAP pro-
gram.

(Though the budget is not yet final, of the $1,000

Rockbridge County’s Alcohol Program

the ASAP program requested Lexington plans to.

allocate $250. Buena Vista is planning to give the. .

program $5,000).

According to Varley, the Lexington Police
Department does not give enough cooperation to
the ASAP program.

“Chief Kirby thinks alcoholism is the result of
not enough willpower. Willpower doesn’t work
with a disease and alcoholism is a disease,’’ said
Varley.

“It’s a difference in perception,’ he added.

In a telephone interview, Chief Kirby said he
does believe alcoholism is the result of not enough
willpower, but flatly disagreed with Varley’s
statement that he has not cooperated with the
ASAP program.

Kirby says he cooperates with ASAP and says
he thinks it is a good thing to give a man a chance
to rehabilitate himself.

‘“‘We’ve had pretty good results with the ASAP
program,” Kirby said, though he noted they have
had a few repeaters.

Varley credited area courts and especially
Judge Joseph Hess with helping fulfill the pro-
gram’s goals.

‘The most important thing to remember is that
we are not attempting to penalize the individual
—just trying to rehabilitate him,’’ Varley said.

man team in Mr. Mollenhoff’s investigative jour-
nalism class. By Steel, Bruce Vale, Cope Moyers,

of how much the subject has had to drink in the
last couple of hours,’’ Hines said.

In Virginia, if the tests indicate .10 level of
alcohol in your_body there is no way you can tell
the judge you weren’t drinking much. In fact, if
you do have that much alcohol in you the law says
you are presumed intoxicated.”

If the test indicate levels between .09 and .05,
there is no presumption of intoxication. And if
you're lucky enough to have less than .05 of alcohol
in your body, the law says there is ‘‘presumption
of no intoxication.”

If you are drunk, it is up to the magistrate as to
whether you'll be staying in jail for a while.

If he feels you are intoxicated, it is the
magistrate’s responsibility to hold you for at least
four hours.

“If. the subject isn’t legally drunk, the
magistrate can be a little more lenient,’’ Trooper
Hines said.

Once you dry out a little, you just don’t leave.
You aren’t going anywhere until the magistrate
sets bond.

In the case of Washington and Lee students, a
surety or personnal recognizance bond will pro-
bably be set.

A surety bond releases you into the custody of
someone else, usually a person of authority. The
indicidual accepts the responsibility you'll show
up for your court date.

A personnal recognizance bond releases you into
the custody of yourself. In other words, the
magistrate trusts you’ll be around when it comes

time for you to face the judge.

Two other types of bonds exist and there is no
guarantee you won't have one of them imposed
upon you.

A cash bond can be set, requiring you to post bet-
ween $250 and $350 before you can be released.

A property bond is usually double what the cash
bond would be and is set depending on the proper-
ty owned by the accused. If you fail to appear for
trial, a lien is placed on the real estate.

Before you finally leave the jail, the magistrate
informs you of the court date and reminds you that
should you fail to appear, you not only forfeit the
bond but send the police out looking for you.

Before the trial, get yourself a lawyer. In
researching past DUI cases, it was determined
that lawyers ensure you'll get a break. More than
half of all drunk driving cases in Rockbridge
County are defended by lawyers. While the
lawyers most unlikely cannot clear you of the
charges, they usually offer important advice and
get the charges reduced.

Bernard J. Natkin and Shuler Kizer handle most
of the drunk driving cases in the county.

If you are a first time offender, things aren’t too
bad.

In fact, you’ll probably have the DUI charge
reduced to reckless driving, provided you agree to
attend the Alcohol Safety Action Program.

The 14-week course costs $200. If and when you
complete the course, the judge is notified and finds
you guilty of the reduced charge of reckless driv-
ing. The fine is $120.

Professor Profile Series

by Parker Potter

John McDaniel is probably
best known for his work with the
Liberty Hall Archeological Pro-
ject. But McDaniel’s impact on
Washington and Lee began
much before the first spadeful
of dirt was moved at Liberty
Hall in 1974.

McDaniel is a 1964 graduate
of W&L. At W&L he was an all
conference quarterback on the
football team and an all-
American midfielder on the
lacrosse team. He was voted
most valuable athelete his
senior year.

Not simply a jock, McDaniel,
a sociology major and biology
minor, was a solid academic
performer. His work in an-
thropology under Dr. James
Leyburn was good enough to
land him in the Ph.D. program
at the University of Penn-

sylvania, one of the top
graduate schools of an-
thropology in the country.

And somehwere or other
McDaniel found the time to par-
ticipate in ROTC. In_ short
McDaniel has fully participated
in the W&L experience from
both sides of the fence.

After graduating W&L in 1964

he went to Penn, earning his
M.A. in 1969. He spent 1968 and

1969 in Peru doing his Ph.D.
research in physical an-

thropology. 1970 and 1971 were
spent as a captain in the Army
and in 1972, the year he return-
ed to W&L McDaniel received
his Ph.D. from Penn.

Asked why he returned to
W&L to teach McDaniel cited
three reasons. ‘‘Leyburn had a
major influence...there were a
lot of people on the faculty I
respected.”’

As well,’ the Penn experience
had a lot to do with it. I became
disenchanted with major
research oriented institutions
where people were interested
exclusively in research, where
students were taught by
graduate assistants. That ex-
perience made what W&L of-
fers even more impressive.”’

Finally, ‘“‘there are other
small institutions which do the
same thing (academically as
W&L), but here I saw a sensible
approach to atheletics, none of
the professionalism which one
sees even at many small
schools.”’

“One reason I chose to attend
W&L over Johns Hopkins as an
undergraduate was my fear
that at Hopkins I would be
nothing but a lacrosse player I
had no such fears about W&L.”’

Since returning to W&L
McDaniel has compiled an im-
pressive record of achievement
in areas other than atheletic.
The Liberty Hall project, under
his direction, was not only a
laboratory for student ar-
cheologists but was and still is
an archeological site of
statewide and national impor-
tance.

The regional archaeological
office established at W&L in
1979 brings state wide recogni-
tion as well as significant fun-
ding to the school.

The State Commissioner of
Archeology at the time, William
Kelso, said that W&L was
awarded the office ‘‘becuase of
the job McDaniel is doing in
historical archeology.”

McDaniel is a recent reci-
pient of the Ring-tum Phi
award, his second since his
return to W&L in 1972. This
award was made in part for
‘this inspired teaching.’’
(McDaniel is, in fact, the only
faculty member to receive two
Ring-tum Phi awards).

About these recognitions
McDaniel says, “I’m very pro-
ud of the awards and the ex-
posure our archaeology has
achieved in the state, but
tremendous credit must be
given to the undergraduates
who have worked hand in hand
with me on our research.”’

“All of our research and
publications that have come
from it are the results of pro-
jects directly involving
undergraduate research.”

As a former player and coach
and now as a techer, McDaniel
has_ strong feelings about
athletics and academics should
dove-tail.

‘Athletics were a major part
of my undergraduate life. I am
convinced that intercollegiate
competition can represent a

valuable educational ex-
perience.”’

“IT am however deeply
disturbed by changes I

perceive. In many sports there
has been a tremendous increase
in both the recourses, personal
and other, allocated to the
sport, and in the time committ-
ment demanded of the stu-
dent/athelete.”’

Of the eleven football starters
is McDaniel’s senior year,” five
went to med school. three to law
school, one was first in his class
in a graduate program at MIT,
one is president of a bank in
Florida and one holds a Ph.D. in
Anthropology.

Further, ‘‘Our program
operated with a total of three
coaches...practice from four
o’clock ’till six o’clock...and
one one hour meeting a week.”’

“The immediate implication
of this confession is a modest in-
vestment might be that it pro-
duced a mediocre record. Our
record for my four years at
W&L was 30 wins, 4 losses and 1
tie. The two years we were in a
conference, we won it.

McDaniel and his teammates
“took tough courses and were
late to practice because of labs.

“TI am committed to the con-
cept that the football ex-
perience helped us in_ the
classroom. However, there was
a recognition that we had other
important things to do at
W&L...we needed time to do

them...the concept of total im-
ersion in an atheletic program
was not a part of our
philosophy.”

“Recently I was appalled
when a student of mine told me
he was really disappointed he
couldn’t engage in a research
opportunity with us because of
an off season committment to a
sport.”

“Off season activity is becom-
ing a growing part of W&L
atheletes. I believe it, and other
insidious escalations in a com-
mittment to winning are a
threat to what has been one of
the most positive aspects of this
unique institution.’’

“The concept of liberal
education articulated so elo-
quently by Edgar Shannor of
U.Va. last weekend demands
that the student be exposed to
many realms of thought and ex-
perience.

“President Huntley, in his

- 1978 speech the ‘W&L Mission’

concurs, ‘first he (the student)
must have a significant learn-
ing experience. in each of the
several kinds of subjects which
make up the liberal arts cir-
riculum.’”’

Says McDaniel, ‘Off season
sports and the implicit, if not
explicit demand for total com-
mittment to a sport raises the
question of the ability of the
W&L athelete to undertake
tough and challenging locals
academically.”

“Perhaps more importantly,
total imersion in sports can
deny the student the opportuni-
ty to become involved in an
academic realm. Grade point is
not the critical index.”’

“The critical clue is the
number of students who become
excited, involved and commit-
ted to learning.”

“The gifted student athelete
may be able to maintain a 3.0
average, but if he has not had
the time to really get involved,
then 3.0 is a testimony to his in-
ate talent, not to what W&L has
done for him.”’

“If we do fail to mirror the
record of the 1963 football team
the tragedy of that loss will for
overshadow the fleeting glory of

winning seasons, national
recognition and the even more
ephemoral ecstasy of personal
recognition.”’

McDaniel’s concerns go fr
beyond those of the stucent
athelete. He takes an active in-
terest in the intellectual health
of the institution.

“I am proud of this institu-
tion, but I am not complacent
about the future. Despite the in-
ane bumper stickers, W&L is
not the University of Virginia. It
is a fine small school that has an
opportunity to become even bet-
ter.”

“Tf all our problems, the most
critical is the attracting and
maintaining of good students. I
enjoy having great students and
I am encouraged by the in-
crease in the applicant pool.

However. I think we have a long
way to go in the realm of attrac-

ting superior students.”’

“The loss of gifted students is
particularly . frustrating. That
loss is no less than an institu-
tional tragedy.”’

“My admittedly biased sam-
ple indicates a lack of an in-
tellectual atmosphere and a
lack of student body diversity
as reasons for leaving.”’

“I favor co-education as a
step toward greater diversity.
In terms of fairness a qualified
girl should not be denied a place
at W&L.”

“T feel that being all male has
little to do with what makes
W&L unique. How many young
Ruth Parmley’s have we denied
the opportunity to attend W&L?

 

“The challenge of developing
a more fertile intellectual at-
mosphere at W&L is sobering.”

McDaniel suggests two
courses of action, an increased
support of undergraduate
research on a decreased institu-
tional acceptance of an overly
strong party orientation.

As for research, McDaniel
feels a need for programs ‘‘that
attract students to work during
the summer (though the R. E.
Lee Research program is a
wonderful start). I’d like to be
able to offer gifted students a
stipend that would make stay-
ing the summer something
other than an economic set-
back.

“Economic support in the
realm of equipment and
research tools would help at-
tract students to academic pur-
suits.”’

McDaniel also suggests the
creation of competition in the
area of student research with
modest awards and wide ex-
posure for the winners.

As well, he feels that there is
much that can be done to adver-
tise the academic opportunities
at W&L as professionally as the
atheletic programs do with
their award winning pamphlets.

McDaniel also suggests that
“alumni support could be
solicited for academically
oriented opportunities. My
students have worked with me
over vacations, however the
funding has all been from out-
side W&L.”’

Reeves Collection At
The Brandywine

More than 200 of the finest
pieces of porcelain made 150 to
200 years ago in China for ex-
port to the United States will be
on display beginning this
weekend at the Brandywine
River Museum in Chadds Ford,
Pa.

The historical pieces are from
the Reeves Collection of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. They will form the major
loan exhibit during the Bran-
dywine’s annual four-day anti-
ques show beginning Friday,
(May 23) and will remain there
through Labor Day weekend.

The Brandywine, with an ex-
traordinary collection of pain-
tings by Andrew Wyeth and
Jamie Wyeth, is one of the na-
tion’s most distinguished art
museums, although it is one of
the newest.

The Reeves Collection exhibi-
tion will show in porcelain form
the artistic influences that
prevailed in the new nation — in
the form of the pieces and in
their decorations, which reflect
political, religious and aesthetic
themes and values. Almost all
the items on loan to the Bran-
dywine from the 2,000-piece col-
lection at W&L were made in
the last years of the 18th cen-
tury, when America began in-
ternational trade on its own in
1783, and the first quarter of the
19th century.

Euchlin D. and Louise Her-
reshoff Reeves donated their
porcelain collection, and other
works of art including almost

 

100 paintings Mrs. Reeves had
painted in the first quarter of
the century, to his alma mater,
Washington and Lee, in 1967.

Since then, the porcelain has
been exhibited through the
United States — partly under
the sponsorship of the Smithso-
nian Institution’s traveling ex-
hibits service during the na-
tional Bicentennial, and partly
under the university’s own
sponsorship in connection with
alumni groups in a_ large
number of cities.

In addition to more than 50
museums and galleries in
America, the Reeves Collection
returned:to its homeland in 1978
— to the Republic of China
(Taiwan) — prior to derecogni-
tion. It was, according to the
Chinese ambassador to the
United States, the first time the
Chinese people had ever had the
opportunity to see the historic
wares their ancestors fashioned
when porcelain-craft was a
principal industry.

In addition to the Reeves
porcelain, five of Mrs. Reeves’
brilliant paintings will be on
Inan to the Brandywine.

When the Reeveses made
their gift to Washington and
Lee, the paintings — which she
herself had hidden for 40 years
Were unknown. But when the
glass under which they were
framed was cleaned off, experts
were astonished at her artistic
talent and her bold, vigorous
use of color. Painting primarily
under her maiden name of

Louise Herreshoff, she had,
subsequent research showed,
been at the forefront of the
revolution in art in the first
years of the century. It remains
a mystery why she abruptly
stopped painting in 1927 and put
all her works into storage in her
home.

The national premiere exhibi-
tion of the paintings of Louise
Herreshoff, ‘‘An American Ar-
tist Discovered,” took place in
Washington’s Corcoran Gallery
of Arts in 1976 — on the centen-
nial of her birth. Since then, the
paintings have been on loan for
exhibitions in 23 museums and
galleries.

McDaniel Talks
About W&L

(continued from page 5)

McDaniel also cites the pro-
giams. where graduates are
kept on campus for a fifth year
as being valuable to both the
students themselves and the
community as a whole.

Also, ‘‘work study students
could be directed to many more

academie areas.” All of these -

are concrete ideas _ which
McDaniel feels will bolster the
intellectual life of the W&L
community.

His other area of concern was
parties. ‘‘An institution wide ef-
fort (should be made) to put
parties in perspective. It is high
time we gave up the party line
on parties — before our reputa-
tion is further damaged.”’

“If you think our party-hardy
reputation is cute, fine. I have
been told by extremely
knowledgable people that our
party school reputation has
kept us from getting certain
research funds.”’

Damaging as well, says
McDaniel, is the passive accep-
tance by the community of
abusive behavior resulting
from intoxication.

“The fact that someone did
something abusive in 1963 and
got away with it is unfortunate,
but it should not set a prece-

stands at a lacrosse game he
should be gone the next day —
period.”

“Those of us who witness
such an event and complain
about what didn’t happen have
no one to blame but ourselves.”’

Though he can be outspoken
about the problems he sees at
W&L, John McDaniel is firmly
committed to the institution and
to the spirit of community he
sees as its centeral tradition.

W&L doesn’t attract teachers
through “‘high salaries, im-
mense research opportunities
or instant pristeige by associa-
tion.”’ Rather, the attraction is
a campus where ‘‘openness, ac-
cusability, and honesty
prevail.”’

To McDaniel W&L is a place
where ‘‘gentle manners go hand
in hand with a committment to
teaching.”’ The aggressiveness,
brashness, arrogance and con-
ceit that were so prevalent at
Penn simply were not a part of
the great teachers I had at
W&L.

‘We at W&L can be proud of a
tradition of successful careers
for our graduates.’’ McDaniel
would attribute that success ‘‘to
a tradition of teachers who en-
joy undergraduate teaching.”’

Sports Wrap Up

by Bill Whalen

As I sit before my typewriter
and bang out this column, I find
myself possessed with mixed
emotions. In some ways I am
happy that I won’t have to write
another story for several mon-
ths, but I am also sad that
another year of sports has pass-
ed by.

Like any other season, I
guess, the 1980 athletic year at
Washington & Lee had its ups
and downs. Naturally, some
sports were surprises while
others failed to live up to their
expectations.

Here are some of this years
highlights and low points:

—To begin with, the football
team suffered through another
losing year. Not since Lyndon
Johnson was President, the
Beatles were still together, and
gas was one-fifth of what it is to-
day, has W&L seen one of its
football teams finish in the
black. But don’t give up, help is
on the way.

—The W&L water polo team
established itself among the
Sport’s southern elite in 1980.
The Generals took on the best

teams in this area, beat them
all, and went to the NCAA Tour-
nament. Not bad for a sport
still relatively unnoticed around
here.

—The basketball team was on
its way to one of its best years in
1980, at least until some players
decided to perform their own
version of ‘‘Push, Push In the
Bush.”’ Despite the Boxwood in-
cident, the Generals were still
able to win another ODAC title.

—The lacrosse team has one
of the most confusing years
ever. Playing the role of the
underdog, the Generals ran
over the likes of Syracuse and
N.C. State. But once the
Generals got up in the polls, the
wins became harder. We’ll pro-
bably never know what went
wrong in the last three weeks of
the season, either.

But despite some nadirs,
there were also some
highlights. In fact, the highlight
of the 1980 athletic season oc-

curred at a time when no one
was paying any attention.

In case you haven’t heard, the
tennis team finished fourth in
the nation among Division III

teams. That’s right, fourth.
Even more impressive is the
fact that Stewart Jackson
managed to collect All-
American honors in both singles
and doubles play. In four years
at W&L, Jackson earned All-
American honors five times.

The reason that you may not
have heard about Jackson’s ac-
complishments is that they
came at a time when the W&L
community was more concern-
ed about the prospects of the
lacrosse team. This just proves
the point that the tennis team

will always have to play the se-

cond .banana among spring
sports as long as the lacrosse
team continues to play well.

That just about sums it all up
for 1080, but what does 1981 hold
in store? For one, the football
and baseball programs. are
bound to improve as better per-
sonnel arrives each season.
Also, this year’s success in
lacrosse may also induce a few
more high school stars to visit
Lexington.

EC Holds Final Meeting

(continued from page 1)

Before delivering his final
remarks, during the period
reserved for suggestions to next
year’s EC, Abraham recom-
mended a change in the way
honor violations are handled.

““Because of the increase in
workload in the honor system,
the EC might consider an honor
council,’’ Abraham said.

He mentioned that Vanderbilt
University runs a similar pro-
gram with 24 to 30 people sitting
on the council which deals ex-
clusively with honor violations.

In this model, the regular EC
would maintain its governing
powers over student organiza-
tions and let the Council handle
matters of honor.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Abraham
and said the workload EC
members carry almost makes
it necessary to change the
system as it stands.

Les Cotter recommended that
next year’s EC pay close atten-
tion to the new organizations
such as the squash, racketball
and outing clubs.

Helping these organizations
out, Cotter said, will help the
students enjoy the university
more.

The EC also heard year-end
reports from the Mock Conven-
tion, The CALYS, the Ring-tum
Phi and the Student Activities
Board.

John Hamilton, Business
Manager of the CALYX,
reported that the yearbook is
going to make a profit of
$1,067.82.

Forty-five percent of the pro-
fit will be divided between
Hamilton and CALYX editor
John Cole.

The other 55 percent of the
profit will go to the Publications
Board reserve fund.

Hamilton told the EC that
yearbooks cost $17.95 a copy.
Last year the CALYX cost
$17.14 per copy.

The CALYX received 38 per-
cent of its budget from the EC
this year. The EC provided the
yearbook with 39 percent of its
budget last year.

Hamilton told the EC that the
yearbook made $1,000 from the
resale of senior pictures this
year and picked up extra money
by helping Southern Seminary
with its color deadline.

He added that shipping the
books was less expensive than
he thought it would be and that

the cover was less expensive
than he thought it was going to
be when the budget was made

up.

The Mock Conventio
reported it is still wrapping its
books up, but that things seem-
ed to be in order.

One of the Mock Convention
Chairmen, Sidney Simmons,
said the individual states were
to raise $10,000 and spend
$9,000.

Simmons was happy to report
that the states ended up raising
$12,000.

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager Kevin McGowan
reported that the paper still has
$3,000 in accounts receivable.

McGowan attributed the
large sum in _ accounts
receivalbe to the Size of the
issues the Phi has published in
May.

He said he and Business
Manager-elect Trent Dickerson
will get out -to collect money
after the last issue of the paper
goes out.

The Student Activities Board
reported that it will have ap-
proximately $400 left in its ac-
count which it plans to give to

Something Nice
For A Change

No one can say that this has been an ordinary and
run of the mill year. We started out with new Rush
rules and surprisingly enough, had little trouble with
Lexington’s finest during Rush. The school has
witnessed several tragic deaths this year. Even
sports had a roller coaster year; the basketball team
lost several top players only to return and win the
ODAC tournament.

In the midst of all this, the Executive Committee
was plugging away, facing one of the largest case
loads in years. There were 33 honor investigations
this year, 15 hearings, 3 convictions and 2 public hear-
ings. While some would have claimed that the EC was
on a witch hunt, anyone who followed and watched
this year’s EC work knows otherwise.

Students at W&L were fortunate this year to have a
hard working, open EC. Two members, Senior
Representative Jay Blumberg and Secretary Cove
Geary, seem to typify the latest edition of the EC.
Geary did an outstanding job as Secretary—he had a
mountain of work to do each week, yet never missed
getting it all done on time. And few people have
represented their class, or the student body, as well
as Jay Blumberg.

The EC faced a difficult year, and came through
quite well. Some of the credit must be given to the
leadership and experience of Steve Abraham, but the
committee as a whole and individually has done a
solid job.

Dear Editor,

Ordinarily, letters to the
editor address an issue of cur-
rent significance or are in
response to an item run in the
paper. This letter fits neither
category. Nope. This one is
merely to correct an error of
omission in the 1980 CALYX.

Before I cite the error; I
would like to reprimand the per-
son responsible John Cole. As a
fellow journalism student and
classmate of Mr. Cole’s, I am
particularly crushed that he
should have such little regard
for a member of the “family.”
Mr. Cole’s mistake has cost him
the favor of this writer (I know
he is equally crushed).

Now for correction. The
following name and information
was excluded from the senior

 

index section of the recently
released yearbook for 1979-80:
CY NESBE BAHAKEL Jr.
Journalism—Dean’s list, two
terms—WLUR staff—Program
Director, _WLUR—President;
Society of Professional Jour-
nalists, Sigma Delta Chi—
Producer, ‘‘Southwest Chroni-
cle,” WBRA-TV—One year,
varsity soccer—Media. Coor-

' dinator, North Carolina Delega-

tion, Mock Convention—super
guy, always.

I urge all of you (members of
1980 especially) to tear this
“editorial’’ out of the Phi and
stick it in the back of your year-
book. Better yet, just put the
whole paper in the yearbook
cover as a token and keepsake
item. You’ll be glad you did.
Buddy Bahakel ’80

The Last Week

The departure of our cherubic little editor,
known affectionately as Mr. Sluggo, to the fields of
free enterprise has made me realize how few are
the days I have left at this fine institution.

Realizing that I’ll probably end up working in
Sears’ men’s department, I decided to look back
rather than forward. While others might face
bright futures, some of us might actually end up
seeing these past four years as the best ones of our
lives.

Therefore, recognizing my future existence as a
beer-swilling Babbitt, I figured that I should set
out to recapture a bit of my past. Grabbing enough
beer, weed and speed to keep my motor running, I
set out with some companions to make my last
week here my most memorable.

Monday — Obviously, we had to get in a road-
trip. So, with music pounding through our smoke-
filled portable coffin, we went careening down
America’s highways,

Luckily, we had few decisions to make as
Hollins was the only target in session at the time.
This was fortunate as I-81 provides probably one
of the best stretches of road for those experienced
in the exhilaration of drunk driving.

Well, after trashing a few apartments, embar-
rassing ourselves in public, and finding the
ugliest, most desperate females, we decided we
were bored.

Stuffing the beasts in the back, we decided to
play Mr. Whimpy while getting some high speed
driving under our belts. Mr. Whimpy, for the
uneducated, consists of non-stop b-hits until either
all members pass out or are willing to admit that
they are whimpies and, thus, devoid of manhood.

Tuesday — We woke up on a golf course
somewhere in West Virginia. The beasts were
gone, but we evidently had captured some
undergarments.

We decided to gear up, return to base, replenish
our suppies and play some all-day Monopoly.

Wednesday — About 3 a.m., halfway through
our 6th game, someone handed me a piece of
paper that I thought was a Frito. I don’t know
what happened, but I did have a dream in which I

met a love goddess who felt beer guts were sexy
and receding hairlines were a sign of virility.

Thursday — ???

Friday — I became aware that I was conscious
around 7 p.m., in the midst of some party. There
were a lot of orthodontized faces and all the
females had designers’ names on their tight-
fitting jeans. We were ina bar in D.C.

I couldn’t handle the fact that, except for the
change from Pappagallo’s to Halston and Calvin
Klein, there was no difference between this bar
and a W&L fraternity party. I asked for another
‘‘Frito’’ and decided we should once again head
back to base camp.

My companions became wary of me, however,
when I tried to accomplish this task by clicking
together three times what I took to be my ruby red
sneakers while chanting ‘I want to go home.’
Sorry, Scarecrow..

After a late night swim in the Wilbur Mills
Reflecting Pool, we pointed the deathmobile
southward.

Saturday — Having decided that everything we
had done before was ‘‘baby stuff,’’ we concluded it
was time to create some action. Unfortunately,
the tanks over at VMI wouldn’t start, so after a
quick drive through the Colonnade we headed for
the beach.

After being mistaken for a beachéd whale, I
decided that the world was too hostile and grabbed
a few, more ‘‘Fritos’’ and joined a game of Mr,
Whimpy played with a pistol and one bullet.

Sunday — After taking a friend to the hospital to
have his ear sewn back on (not a very good shot), I
knew it was time to crash. However, I was
dissuaded from passing out by a roommate who
was in the mood for some full contact golf. After
winning, . by virtue of a five-iron to his thorax,
however, I knew I was on the ropes.

Yet, I was pleased. I had condensed a four-year
career into one week of memories. Sure, my car
was beat up, and one guy had lost an ear, and we
did have a few tickets, and the news office is com-
plaining about our charging the whole thing to
them, but hey...it was all just in fun.
