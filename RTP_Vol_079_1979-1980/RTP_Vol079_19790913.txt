NUMBER 1

 

 

A former Washington
and Lee student who was
asked to leave school last
spring because of an
honor offense has been
granted a second closed
trial, apparently in re-
sponse to a federal suit
asking for the proceed-
ing, according to a story
which appeared in the
Roanoke Times and
World News yesterday.

Peter Engel of Oakhurst,
N.J., was found guilty of an
honor code violation last May,
four weeks before he was to
graduate, according to the suit
filed last spring in Lynchburg
Federal District Court. The suit
contended Engel’s  constitu-
tional rights of due process had
been violated and asked that he
be reinstated as a student and

 

| given another trial in order to

Student Granted Second
Private Honor Trial

present additional evidence.

Engel confirmed to Roanoke
Times reporter Richard
Lovegrove that University of-
ficials have granted another
private hearing to be conducted
later this month, an almost un-
precedented occurrence in the
history of the school’s honor
system.

Washington and Lee’s honor
system is run by the students.
Members of the student body
Executive Committee are
charged with the duty of hear-
ing reported honor code viola-
tions and generally upholding
the honor system. Honor hear-
ings are closed to the press and
school officials are forbidden to
comment on cases either pen-
ding or resolved.

According to the suit, Engel
was accused of an honor viola-
tion on May 1 and received his
closed trial on May 2. After the
trial, the senior was given a
five-day extension to uncover

further evidence to prove his
innocence—also an_ un-
precedented move. Engel did
not produce the new evidence
until May 8, or later than the ex-
tension allowed for, according
to the suit.

As could be expected in such a
circumstance, University
President Robert E.R. Huntley
and W&L attorney Eric Sisler
declined to comment on the
case, Engel’s attorney, William
O. Roberts, and student body
president Steve Abraham also
refused to comment on the
honor trial.

The Ring-tum Phi has learned
that Engel’s federal suit against
the school has been withdrawn.

The student body Executive
Committee meets Monday at
6:30 p.m. in their room in the
University Center building and
is expected to be questioned
about the status of the case at
that time.

 

 

by John Billmyre

Strict enforcement by police
of Lexington’s noise ordinance
for amplified music seems to
have driven a wedge between
Interfraternity Council
representatives and members
of the Interfraternity Council
Judicial Board.

During the Tuesday evening
meeting many IFC represen-
tatives complained that the IFC
lacks unity and purpose in fac-
ing the city on the noise or-
dinance question.

Six fraternities, Lambda Chi,
Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa
Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi
Kappa Phi and Sigma Nu, have
been served summonses to
court for violating the noise or-
dinance.

Under a rule passed by the
IFC Judicial Board, the elected
body which handles fraternity
discipline, fraternities receiv-
ing summonses will not go
before the IFC Judicial Board
until the fraternity has been to
court.

* Lambda Chi, which received
its summons earlier in the year
than the other houses, has
already been to court and fined
$63.
The Judicial Board decided
not to act on the Lambda Chi
noise violation because it in-
volved individuals living in the
house and making repairs and
not a party. Those individuals

were ordered by the board to
pay the fine.

‘We have no jurisdiction over
the case because it was not a
fraternity function,’ said Syd
Farrar, IFC President.

A special meeting between
Chief of Police James A. Kirby,
City Manager John Doane and
several W&L officials was
scheduled for yesterday.

But it was earlier in the
meeting that tempers flared
and discussion was loud.

Dave Meyers, President of
Phi Kappa Psi, suggested the
IFC hire a local attorney to de-
fend the fraternities in court.

Meyers was arrested on Sept.
8 on a noise ordinance violation.

Delta Tau Delta President
Andy DeMuth suggested to
representatives that noise per-
mits be taken out in the name of
individuals instead of frater-
nities.

“Then the individual and not
the fraternity will lose the
privilege to take out a permit
because of a violation,’”’ said
DeMuth.

Without permits, fraternities
making excessive noise are sub-
ject to larger fines and general-
ly harsher punishment.

IFC Vice President Charles
Terry told representatives to
hold their suggestions until IFC
President Syd Farrar arrived.

When Farrar arrived several
minutes later a heated discus-

IF C Discusses Noise

sion began.
Split Body

Most representatives com-
plained that the IFC lacked
cohesion on the noise issue and
some representatives even
blamed the Judicial Board for
the problem.

Break In

No Prosecution

For Intruder

An Evans Dining Hall con-
struction worker who apparent-
ly tried to enter through the
window the room of a female
law student, Sept. 3, has been
expelled from campus, but will
not be prosecuted.

‘In order to press charges
and prosecute,’ said Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. Read, ‘‘an intent to commit
crimes prior to the offense of
break-in must be established.”

Read cited a lack of evidence
and peculiarities in Virginia’s
law dealing with trespassing as
major factors contributing to
the decision not to prosecute.

“My duties as prosecutor are
governed by Virginia law,”’ said
Read. ‘‘And if a technicality of
the law prevents a man from
being charged, then it would be
improper to have a man ar-
rested without sufficient
evidence.”

Read explained that trespass-
ing can only be prevented by
prior notice.

The worker has been notified
by the University and is no
longer allowed on the W&L
campus, subsequently causing
him to lose his job.

According to the student, she
first noticed the man staring in
the window while she combed
her hair, looking ina mirror.

On the following day, Thurs-
day, the worker came to the stu-
dent’s door and apologized for

staring through the window.

Later that night the man
returned and knocked on the
student’s door.

Recognizing the voice as
belonging to the worker whom
she had seen staring in her win-
dow, the student locked her
door, told the man to leave and
ran through an adjoining
bathroom and into another stu-
dent’s room.

Apparently, the man ran out-
side and tried to climb through
the window.

Lexington police arrived and
found a crushed window screen,
and a muddied footprint on the
window sill.

According to Lexington Chief
of Police James A. Kirby, the
police picked up a_ suspect
shortly before 8:00 A.M. Fri-
day.

Kirby attributes the decision
not to prosecute to Read while
Read claims both men had a
hand in the decision.

Read said he and two law
clerks investigated the case and
could not find grounds for pro-
secution.

“Often actions take place that
may be crimes, but if there is
not sufficient evidence, charges
cannot be placed.

School Proctor Bob Murray
said patrolling of the area has
been stepped up, but no other
changes have been planned.

Five Fraternities Cited

For Noise Violations

by David Greer

Once again, the Lexington
noise ordinance is on the minds
of the fraternity members.
Already, five fraternities have
been issued summons for
violating the city code.

Lambda Chi Alpha was found
guilty of violating the noise or-
dinace and of havigg amplified
sound without a_ permit.
Substitute Judge Robert S.
Culpepper fined the fraternity
$25 and costs for each offense.

Phi Kappa Sigma and Sigma
Nu were each issued summons
for violations at 2 a.m. on
September 7. Pi Kappa Alpha
was issued a summons at 4a.m.

on September 9 andPhi Kappa
Psi at 2:30 a.m. the same day.
Those cases have not appeared
in court.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said he will not issue
amplified sound permits to
fraternities for weeknights.
“Any music that’s amplified
must have a permit,” Kirby
said.

Interfraternity Council presi-
dent Syd Farrar said University
Proctor Charles F’. Murray will
try to keep an eye on the frater-
nities and warn them when the
music is too loud.

Wednesday afternoon Farrar,
IFC Vice-president Charles V.
Terry, Assistant Dean of

Students Danny Murphy, Kirby,
and Lexington City Manager
John B. Doane met in Doane’s
office to discuss the noise or-
dinance and its relation to
fraternities.

The group agreed to have all
amplified sound permits for
houses that have been issued
summons first approved by
Farrar and then by Kirby.
“This is to make the IFC aware
that a house has had trouble,”’
Terry said. The IFC Judicial
Board cannot act until after a
house has been tried by the city.

“The meeting was to help us
understand each other’s posi-
tions and get on good footing for
the rest of the year,” Terry
said.

State Chairmen Gear Up
For Mock Convention

Intensive work toward the
1980 Mock Convention has
been underway since the
spring of 1977, under the
leadership of co-chairman
Craig Cornett, Dick
Schoenfeld amd _ Sidney
Simmons. As the 17th W&L
Mock Convention draws
near, every possible means
to carry on the traditions of
authenticity and accuracy
are being used. The Con-
vention staff and _ state
delegation chairmen have
been named, and_ their
work is already well under-

way.
State delegation
chairmen and_ research

directors have perhaps the
greatest responsibility for
assuring the accuracy of
the Mock Convention; their
diligent, conscientious ef-
forts are crucial to success.
The Washington and Lee
Mock Convention will take
place three months before
the actual Republican con-
vention and prior to many

state primaries. In feature
articles to appear every
week we will be addressing
various aspects of the con-
vention from _ candidate
profiles to updating the
progress of the committees
and state delegations in-
volved in the planning and
coordination of the Mock
Convention.

by Guy Stewart

When embarking on a
political exercise such as the
Mock Convention, problems
arise which can only be
alleviated through cooperation
and diligience by everyone in-
volved. From the Convention
Chairmen down to members of
each state delegation, a total
commitment is. required in
order for the Mock Convention
to succeed. —

Vital to the Convention’s suc-
cess and continuation of the
reputation for accuracy is the
State Chairman and his delega-
tion. The selection of the State
Chairman is undertaken with
great care for a_ state
represented by an irresponsible

 

Parents

ever

  

 

and unorganized State Chair-
man results in a state delega-
tion which cannot contribute
significantly to the nominating
process at the Convention.

The fundamental assignment
of a State Chairman os to
organize his delegation and try
to infect its members with a
dedication towards making
their delegation the best coor-
dinated at the Convention.

There are an abundance of
duties for which each state
delegation is responsible;
however the most important
tasks are fund raising and
political research. State Chair-
man solicit contributions from
donors in their states. The
money raised is budgeted for
expenses which include a fixed
fee to the Steering Committee,
postage, stationary, phone ex-
penses, and accomodations for
visiting dignitaries. There are
also expenses for parties and
the state float which each
delegation is committed to
entering in the parade.

The main obstacle to be
hurdled for a State Chairman
and his delegation is their defi-
ciency of knowledge about their
state’s political process. This
situation is remedied through

the establishment of political
contacts within the actual state
delegation and by researching
as detailed as possible, each
state’s political affairs.

It is the duty of the State
Chairman to know how the state
he represents feels about cer-
tain issues and how each can-
didate reacts towards these
issues. By maintaining cor-
respondence with state leaders,
party chairmen, Convention
delegates and by reading the
state’s major newspapers, a
state chairman will be able to
capture the political mood of his
state and generate that same
feeling within his Mock Conven-
tion state delegation.

The true indicator of the
Mock Convention’s excellence
is the ability of the student
delegates to accurately repre-
sent the many diverse sectors of
the national political scene.
Although the students who con-
stitute the 1980 Mock. Conven-
tion delegations are not as
geographically varied as the
American citizens, their at-
tempt to emulate the diverse
society will be successful if they
can correctly predict the 1980
Republican Presidential can-
didate in May.

 

 

Students

Arrested
For

Playing
In Street

by David Greer

Three Washington and Lee
students were issued sum-
monses Sunday for throwing a
football in the street.

Lexington Police Officer Jack
Purvis issued summonses to
Ham Davis, Hall Vetterlein and
Scott Graham. Purvis con-
fisoated the football, which
belonged to another student.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said the three were
violating a city ordinance which
prohibits playing in the street,
throwing objects in or across
the street, or “running things
across the street, like a water
hose.”

Kirby said the police had the
football and the owner had not
claimed it. He said it will be
held until the court decides
what to do with it.

“We tried to get.it back and
he (Purvis) wouldn’t give it to
us,” Davis said. ‘‘They’ve
played catch in front of the Delt
house before and no one has
ever been hurt.”

The case will be tried Oct. 2.

to write home once a week from college

is in for more of an education than the son.

Changes In

by David Greer

Freshmen will not be allowed
to pledge fraternities until after
the fourth rush-date on Sept. 21,
according to new Interfraterni-
ty Council rulés.

IFC Vice-president Charles
V. Terry said this measure was
enacted to ‘take the pressure
and confusion of Rush off the
shoulders of the freshmen.”’

According to the new rules,
freshmen will return to the
dorms after the fourth rush-
date. At 11 p.m. the freshmen
will go to the houses they have
received bids from and wish to
join.

All fraternity members must
be inside their houses at 11
p.m., and no fraternity can pro-

vide transportation to the
house.
Freshmen will turn in

preference cards on Monday,
Oct. 1, stating which fraternity,
if any, they wish to join.
Freshmen can also pledge
anytime after the fourth Rush-
date.

No contact rules this year
prohibit fraternities from giv-
ing freshmen rides to girls’
schools during no contact and
limited contact periods.

Fraternities can give
freshmen rides on Saturdays
and Sundays and can _ lend

Rush Rules

treshmen cars. Fraternities are
also not allowed to give rides to
freshmen to parties outside of
Lexington during the no contact
or limited contact periods.

IFC president Syd Farrar
said the no transportation rul-
ing was made to prevent situa-
tions where freshmen would be
obligated to stay with one
fraternity. With independent
transportation, they would not
be trapped down the road and
would have a chance to attend
other parties.

Only two fraternity-
sponsored parties during the
week will be allowed, and they
must be held on the Wedsnes-
day nights of September. In-
formal parties not sponsored by
fraternity funds may be held,
but the no-transportation rule
applies.

During no contact periods,
fraternity members cannot
associate with freshmen
anywhere, including the dorms,
the Dining Hall, the Co-op, or
the Collonade.

‘“‘No contact’”’ means no con-
tact. Any violations will be left
up to the Judicial Board”’ of the
IFC, Farrar said.

Farrar said that about 340 of
the 368 freshmen are _par-
ticipating in Rush. “It’s been
pretty much free of controver-
sy. There haven’t been as many
conflicts as last year,’”’ Farrar
said.

New Wave Speads Over Summer

by Mark Kinniburg

This summer’s album crop
was more than enough to put a
dent in summer earnings, and if
one desired to limit his choice to
a few selections, there would
have been considerable trouble
in determining which one
deserved purchase. In every
phase of the wide musical boun-
daries of rock, jazz and folk,
there were very respectable en-
tries into the summer album
buyers spree.

Among my favorite rock en-
tries are a varied collection of
new wave, older style R’n’B and
a nice dose of standard
quasiheavy-metal-shake-the-
room-rock. Although very much
a matter of personal choice,
music can be thought of as an
ambiguous entertainment.

Two people may enjoy the
same music for different
reasons, or dislike it for the
same,

Rock’s new wave was kicked
off this summer by the B-52’s
from Athens, Ga., with “Rock
Lobster” A favorite of East
Coast beach bums, the once
obscure tune has become a
focal point for Warner Brothers
Records’ new wave sales pitch,
calling to retailers that new
wave can make money. A more
“traditional’’ approach to new
wave was the Talking Heads
“Fear of Music” album with its
songs about life during war,
drugs, cities, (‘Did I forget to
mention Memohis, home of the
ancient Greeks and Elvis?”)
and other concerns of the day.
The excellent reception of the
album by critics and record
buyers alike proved that the
success of ‘“‘Take Me to the
River” in 1977 was no fluke of
talent.

Calendar

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will again offer free
subscriptions to its “Weekly
Calendar’ for the 1979-80
academic year.

The Calendar is published
each Friday except during the
Christmas vacation, and lists
every public event scheduled at
W&L for the following two
weeks, with details about loca-
tion, lecture topics, and admis-
sion fees if they are charged.

Almost every event at W&L is
open to the public. All speeches,
art exhibits, most athletic
events, and many musical and
dramatic offerings are free,
and admission costs are
minimal for the relatively few
events on which a charge must
be placed, the university said.

The free subscriptions are
available through the W&L
News Office, and those in-
terested in receiving the Calen-
dar may write or they may
telephone 463-9111, ext. 317.

If a person has a post-office
box, postal regulations require
W&L to use that instead of a
street address. In addition, a
complete route and box number
are required by the Postal Ser-
vice for rural patrons.

Another new album that rais-
ed the questions of why it takes
so long to get such a great
album out of the studio was
Robert Fripp’s “Exposure.”

most recently for The Roches,
Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno.
His solo album has all the
touches which make his work so
unique and enjoyable on the
albums of others.

Exposure is a concept album

The B-52s

which draws on slow melodic
tunes to hard driving rock ‘n’
roll, and then again back to ex-
perimental tape manipulation
and studio magic. One of the
best points of the album,
however, is the impression that

 

the album fits so well together,
not as if the songs were record-
ed haphazardly and one song at
a time, but as if they were,
rather, recorded with a single
take in a very fluid mix.

In another excellent summer-
released album, Led Zepplin
proved that they are still the
kings of loud rock in the English
tradition. Adding a few years of
experience into the standard
form, however, Led Zepplin has
turned almost every selection ,
on the album into an accessible
song in the same manner that
made ‘Stairway to Heaven” a
prom theme classic. Touching
into funk and disco at times,
and mocking rockability at
others, the album is bound to be
the top seller of 1979.

Be on the lookout for...Bruce
Springsteen’s new albumn the
first part of October...A new
collection of Beatle greats at a

Muppet Movie Revives ‘Old Hollywood’

Jefferson Robert Coufal
Remember ‘*Old
Hollywood?’’ Remember

polished studio productions,
good vs. evil, a man with a
dream, romance, and happy en-
dings?

The Muppet Movie is ‘Old
Hollywood.’’ Kermit the Frog is
almost the reincarnation of
Bing Crosby just as Henson’s
studio seems to be Disney’s
studio of the 30’s born again,
with its impeccable production
and craft.

The plot is simple enough:
Kermit the Frog sets out to
answer an open audition for
frogs in Hollywood in order to
become rich and famous and
more importantly to make
millions of people happy.

On the way, he befriends Foz-
zie Bear (with a Studebaker, no
less), Gonzo the plumber with
his girlfriend (a chicken, forc-
ing us to ask yet again: what is
Gonzo?), Miss Piggy (the love
interest), Rolf, the piano play-
ing dog, and Dr. Teeth and the
Electric Mayhem.

The villan is a Colonel
Sanders type who is trying to
get Kermit to promote his
french fried frogs legs.
Needless to say, Kermit wins
and signs the ‘Standard rich
and famous contract’ with
World Wide Studios. A plot not
only like old Hollywood, but
about it as well.

The movie sags only during
the cameos by human. Mel
Brooks blows some terribly fun-
ny dialogue and Dom DeLouise
is pathetically un-funny while

the considerable talents of Or-

son Welles, Milton Berle, and

Richard Pryor have almost no

lines to go with them. Having
the late Edgar Bergen and
Charlie McCarthy do a scene
was a nice touch of nostalgia.

As it was directed by James
Frawley, The Muppet Movie
doesn’t have the fast paced,
almost manic speed that Jim
Henson’s projects normally do.
‘This is perhaps for the best as a
high energy level would be both
hard to maintain and difficult to
endure for two hours.

The jokes are funny, and the
running gags are underdone

rather than overdone. The
music by Paul Williams is
benign, which makes one
wonder what ever happened to
the genius who composed the
muppet classics ‘‘Rubber
Duckie,” “It’s Not Easy Being
Green,” and “Gone With the
Wind?”

Some of the special effects,
like Kermit riding a bicycle, are
fairly amusing, and I only saw
puppet wires once.

Most of the Muppets are in the
movie, but few new ones ap-

pear. There is no sign of Burt
and Ernie, Floyd (and his:
boomerang fish) has only one
line, and Big Bird makes a
cameo appearance. (Big Bird is
met on the road going East to
New York to become rich and
famous in public television. )

On the whole it’s an in-
credibly bright, funny film. It’s
entertaining in the ‘Old
Hollywood’’ tradition—
unpretentious, and fun. And if
you see it, stay through the end
credits for one last laugh.

Bookstore: Fighting Inflation

, Overheard in the Textbook
Dept: “What a rip-off!’’ “That
book has gone up $2.00 since last
year!” “I’m going to change
courses, the books for this class
are too expensive.’ ‘Mrs.

- Munger, what are the cheapest
course books you have here?”’

These and many more
remarks are ringing in our ears
(with the expletives deleted).
We heartily agree with you.
Textbooks are out of sight, man.
But the students here can be
assured that every book is pric-
ed at the publishers’ suggested
list price. The Bookstore’s
margin of profit is small—
barely enough to cover the cost
of shipping the books to Lex-
ington (enormous!), salaries
(modest) for the staff and our
overhead.

As a glimmer of comfort for
the future, the Bookstore is em-
barked on an expanding used-
book program. Next spring we
will buy back textbooks which
will be used the following fall.
We will pay % price for texts in
good condition. Emphasis on

good condition! So if students
want to recover some of the

they must treat their texts with

One other serious reminder:
We will accept books for return

W&L Receives Gift

A series of personal letters
and records spanning 80 years
in the history of an important
industry in southwest Virginia
has been added to the special
collections of Washington and
Lee’s undergraduate library.

The documents, which record

the growth of a Botetourt Coun- .

ty limestone industry founded
in 1869 by Confederate Col. Ed-

ward Dillon, were presented to
Washington and Lee by three of
his grandchildren, who are still
frequent visitors to the area.

Donors of the collection are
Miss Mary Unity Dillon, Miss
Susan Pendleton Dillon of
Washington, D.C., and Frank C,
Dillon Jr. of Roanoke.

Born in Salem, Va., in 1835,

a prominent Valley family. His
grandfather was the owner of
Botetourt Springs, now the site
of Hollins College. Dillon’s
career in the U.S. Army began
in 1857, but he resigned his com-
mission in 1861 when Virginia
seceded from the Union. Before
the fall of the Confederacy, he
had reached the rank of colonel
in the 2nd Mississippi Cavalry—
but found himself destitute at
the close of the war.

To support his family, Dillon
accepted the position of traffic
agent and manager of the
James River and Kanawha
Canal, and it was then that he
discovered the tremendous in-
dustrial potential in the
limestone of the upper James
River Valley. Several years
were spent investigating the
area, as Dillon continued with
his duties for the canal—the
same company whose stock,
donated in 1796 by George
Washington, saved W&L’s
predecessor institution, Liberty
Hall, from financial ruin.

In 1869 Dillon signed the first
lease for a quarry, lime kiln and
other facilities and within three
years the family was firmly
established at Indian Rock, a
bluff overlooking the river. The
Indian Rock estate remained
the Dillon home for more than a
century, until the last residents

closed the house in 1976.
Col. Dillon moved to Lex-
ington in 1890, living at

Mulberry Hill, near the site of
Liberty Hall, until his death in
1897. During his lifetime, the
limestone company’s success
led to the opening of railroad
lines, post offices and entire
residential communities.

Sweet Briar College in
Amherst, Virginia

This is the most closely
guarded bastion of the Southern
female gentry in the area, pro-
bably in the entire South.
Security is the tightest here and
a few of W&L’s fraternities are
even banned from the premises.

You hit the main guardhouse
at the front gate where a securi-
ty cop will check your license
and take down your name. Then
he (or she) will ask you who you
are visiting and which dorm she
lives in. He’ll probably record
your car’s license plate number
and may take down the names
of the passengers with you.

They come looking for you at
midnight or whenever the wit-
ching hour comes—when all the
little girls turn into pumpkins,
or whatever happens to them. If
you’re lucky and don’t hassle
the rent-a-cops too much,
they’ll let you go.

The security guards do not,
however, like it if you play
games with them, give them
alot of lip, or take a swing in

their general direction. No
sense of humor those rent-a-cop
types. Sometimes, if you’re real
nasty, they’ll call in the
Amherst police. Those who
have slept there don’t recom-
mend the accommodations at
the Amherst jail.

Perhaps you’ll have occasion
to attend a boat house party,
which you will find hot, smoky,
and too crowded, with, surpris-
ingly, not enough girls. Well,
girls study hard at Sweet Bush.

Needless to say, with all the
obstacles involved in
establishing a meaningful rela-
tionship with a Sweet Briar girl,
W&L students don’t go down the
road to the Bush with the same
frequency as they used to. (And
I haven’t even told you about
the ride over the mountains to
Amherst on Route 60.)

Reliable sources report that
some Sweet Briar girls are
beginning to feel a bit isolated
because of what the strick
security measures have done to
their social life. But the solitude
gives them more time to ride
their horses.

Generals Lose Opener
Travel to Emory and Henry Saturday

by Bill Whalen

The 1979 version of
Washington and Lee football
took their act on the road last
Saturday. Considering the way
the game went, the Generals
should be happy that the contest
was played in the anonymity of
Delaware Valley College.

W&L fumbled the opening
kickoff, turned the ball over a
total of eight times and lost to
Delaware Valley by the score of
30-0.

Despite the lopsided score
and the plethora of mistakes,
second year coach Gary Fallon
was not too disturbed by his
team’s performance. ‘You
have to remember we're a
young team and we have a shot
at every game we play,”’ said
the coach. ‘“‘How well we play
depends upon how well we ex-
ecute.”’

Last Saturday, the Generals
did not execute. The offense
fumbled a total of eight times,
losing all but two. Two passes
were also- intercepted, as the
Generals continue to be plagued
by the miscues of last vear’s
team.

In last year’s opener at
Madison (a 49-7 loss), the
Generals fumbled a total of four

times and were likewise in-
tercepted twice.

Offensively, the Generals had
many problems. Besides losing
the ball eight times, the offense
could not establish a running
game. Senior tailback and tri-
captain Stewart Atkinson ran 17
times for 48 yards. Junior
fullback Lee Minetree rushed
five times for 15 yards while
sophomore quarterback Rich
Hachenburg was sacked for a
total of minus 38 yards. On the
day, the Generals gained only
39 net yards while Delaware
Valley controlled the ball, and
ran nearly twice as many plays
(80 to W&L’s 46) to roll up 278
net yards on the ground.

Defensively, the Generals did
not play a bad game. The
defense allowed two first half
touchdowns (one in each
quarter) and a third quarter
field goal as the score was only

16-0 going into the final fifteen
minutes. Delaware Valley add-
ed two late touchdowns to end
the scoring at 30-0.

Hachenburg enjoyed more
success in the air than on the
ground. The quarterback who
hit on 50.5% of his passes in
1978, hit on 7 of 10 passes for 68
yards. The longest completion
was a 21-yard strike to tight end

Mike Fogarty. In his last two
games, Hachenburg has com-
pleted 23 of 34 passes, good for
316 yards.

This Saturday, the Generals
travel to Emory & Henry for a
1:30 ODAC contest. The Wasps
scored an 18-17 comeback vic-
tory last year and Fallon ex-
pects another ‘‘tough contest.’
“Their team is well-coached
and is a scrappy outfit,”’ said
the coach. “‘We don’t expect to
run over them but we don’t
want to beat ourselves.”’

Though stalled on offense last
week, W&L will once again use
their I-slot running formation.
Said Fallon: ‘‘We’ll take
whatever is available and we’ll
stay with whatever is  suc-
cessful.”

The Generals will be at home
on Wilson Field on Saturday,
September 22. The opponent is
Centre College of Danville, Ky.

Anyone interested in playing
J.V. football, please come to

Doremus Gym in the upper

Reis Takes Over
as New S.LD.

LEXINGTON, VA.—Ken
Reis, assistant sports informa-
tion director at Furman Univer-
sity and a _ recent honor
graduate of the Greenville,
S.C., school, was named sports
information director at
Washington and Lee University
early this summer.

“Our staff was impressed
when meeting Ken for an inter-
view and feels that, in spite of
his youth, he will bring vigor
and enthusiasm to the fine pro-
gram developed by Bill
Schnier,”’ W&L Athletic Direc-
tor and Physical Education
Department Chairman William
McHenry commented when an-
nouncing the appointment.

Schnier, W&L’s sports in-
formation director since
August, 1976, resigned in April
to become SID at Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, Va.
While at W&L, Schnier won na-

tional recognition for 13 of his
sports publications.

Reis graduated cum laude in
June from Furman, where he
majored in communica-
tions/public relations and serv-
ed as assistant sports informa-
tion director for three years.
During spring, 1978, he was the
schools interim -SID. His
primary sports information
responsibility was coordinating
publicity for eight of Furman’s
12 varsity men’s sports.

In addition to his sports in-
formation duties, Reis served
two years as sports editor of the
The Paladin, Furman’s stu-
dent newspaper, and one year
as sports department assistant
at The Greenville News.

“Ken has had extensive ex-
perience in the Furman pro-
gram and promises to continue
his fine work here,’’ McHenry
concluded.

Powell Jones, Junior Class
President and Sigma Nu
representative, accused the ad-
ministration of cooperating
with the city to “crack down”
on fraternities.

“It looks like there is some
cohoots between the town and
the faculty,” said Jones.

University Representative
Dan Murphy denied the accusa-
tion, but not before several
other representatives vocally
supported and applauded
Jones.

When the meeting finally got
down to business, the existence
of another problem was con-
firmed.

Farrar announced that Chief
Kirby will no longer grant noise
permits during the week.

He also told representatives
that the outcome of the meeting
with city officials will be reveal-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Ph:

 

The Fraternities’ Situation

Let's not kid ourselves. Underneath the candy
coating of the hectic, almost dizzying pace of Rush
lies the reality that not all is well with Washington and
Lee's fraternity system. As the year begins, the
fraternities seems to be backed into a corner, with no
room for bargaining or even negotiation.

A sizeable number of college students were shocked
and wounded last year when the city fathers sent a
third-year law student/student body president pack-
ing home with his ‘‘reasonable and fair’’ solution to
the ‘‘noise problems”’ dragging on the ground behind
him. The city council didn’t buy the argument that
they should compromise Lexington’s noise ordinance
in return for some ‘concessions’ on fraternity
rowdiness. What the fraternities’ ‘‘concessions”’
amounted to were promises that they would try not to
break the law as much as they had in the past. But
fraternity men still do not seem to have figured out
that the city does not want the law broken at all.

 

We may not agree with your point of view. We may even think

your criticisms and opinions are misplaced or downright wrong.
But we will always print the letters you send into us. After all, if you
can't voice your sentiments in your student newspaper, then
what good are we?

After not even coming up to bat with city hall, some
bitter fraternity members talked about a boycott of
the city’s businesses. The idea was to “‘pressure’’ the
city council to bend to the fraternities’ will. But the
idea was scrapped when they realized that the loss of
fraternity business, even if possible, would probably
not shut down the city of Lexington, or even cripple it
into submission.

‘hen when the fraternities started talking about
fighting city hall with the aid of the faculty and alum-
ni, they discovered that alumni and faculty support
had been eroding for years. Oh, the indicators had
been around for a number of years, but fraternity
men hadn’t noticed them until several faculty
members publicly expressed their unfavorable opi-
nions of the fraternities. In fact, many members of
W&L’s faculty are among the fraternities’ strongest
critics. The alumni lost their enthusiasm for the
fraternities’ plight in this matter when they saw the
shape that their old houses had deteriorated into.

With no substantial support from the faculty and
alumni forthcoming, the fraternities found
_ themselves in their present situation—with little or no
clout or bargaining leverage. The next chapter in this
story was the claim that this ‘‘sudden’’ enforcement
of the law was ‘‘unfair.”’ But the timeless fraternity
man’s tactic of blaming the members who were there
before him for causing his predicament is not selling
well anymore. The faculty, alumni, and the towns-
people want the whole show cleaned up now. All they
really want is for fraternity members to act respon-
sibly according to the laws of society and in ac-
cordance with their role as members of the communi-
ty. And they seem to be serious about wanting that
responsible behavior to begin immediately.

_ The irony of it all is that the students who have
realized the fraternities are backed into a no-
compromise situation and are trying to work within
the system have been denounced as traitors to the
cause. If Syd Farrar and the Interfraternity Council’s
Judicial Board act as they know they have to, they
will be among the most hated members of the student
body. But if they don’t fine heavily for infractions of
the rules, self-government for fraternities might be
lost and a few fraternities may be disbanded to make
the point clearer. As it is, the whole fraternity system
is under review by what is now a majority of the facul-
ty. The faculty has made it it very clear that they hold
the future of W&L’s fraternities within their collective
hands, but it is up to the fraternities to demonstrate to
the University and to the town their intentions to
behave in a more responsible manner in the im-

mediate future.

Parker Potter

Here we are, ready for the kickoff of yet
another season of W&L’s biggest fall sport—
not football, fraternity rush.

Many freshmen are probably full of ner-
vous anticipation. Sophmores are excited to
be playing it from the other side of the hand-
shake for the first time. Juniors, who’ve been
there before are busy trying to see that things
are done right. And those seniors involved,
those grizzled veterans, could probably live
without the hustle and bustle of their fourth
Rush—but there’s no stopping it.

 

Parker Potter, a 1979 graduate of Washington
and Lee, is currently studying at the University
under a Liberty Hall Fellowship

 

It seems to me, that of all the aspects of
what must be called an artificial social situa-
tion at W&L, the four weeks of Rush are the
most artificial. I mean, you can be charming
and attentive to only so many housefuls of
strangers in the course of one evening. And on
the other side, best behavior is hard to main-
tain through 10 car rides, five Mr. Pibbs, 150
handshakes and hundreds of new faces.

There is no denying that Rush is, if nothing
else, a strange and difficult way to spend four
weeks. But alas, it does its job better than any
conceivable alternative. Strange as it may be,
this particular system survives because it
does its job.

This is not to suggest that there aren’t ways
to make the system work more smoothly or
more happily. To the end of making this hec-
tic, anxious month of Rush as easy as possible
on everyone involved, I offer a few sugges-
tions:

To you upperclassmen:

Remember your first few weeks at W&L.
Absolutely everything about your life was
brand new. The place you lived, the people
around you, the things you were doing.
Remember that you weren’t always the stud
you are today; that you were at times confus-
ed, didn’t know exactly what to wear, what to
say. Most of all, realize that a freshman’s
first real introduction to W&L is through
Rush.

I’m not saying be best buddies with every
freshman who passes through your house. |
am saying, be friendly or at least civil, be
helpful, be honest, at least give everyone a
chance. Just because a guy doesn’t fit into
your house doesn’t mean that he is a leper or a
dolt or has nothing to offer. It takes more than
just Delts or just Phi Kaps or just Lamb-
chops to make a University.

To you freshmen:

Try to understand the attitude of the up-
perclassmen. They’ve all been through this
before, shaken a million hands. There are
many things which may be more fun or press-
ing than Rush: girls, Goshen, booking, or ap-
plications to law school; but they’re there,
drinking the beers, shaking the hands.

Many houses have a pretty good idea of
what kind of man they’re looking for before
you even hit campus. This makes things
easier for them, harder for you.

In spite of that, the key is to be yourself, and
to a degree, to remember your place. You’re
no longer the King of the Hill in your high
school; you’re the new kid on the block. The
point is nobody likes loud, obnoxious
freshmen. They get blackballed quickest of
all.

But nobody likes a ‘‘bump on a log,’’ either.
You’re tossed into this whirlpool both to sell
yourself and to let the houses sell themselves
to you. You’re not in any one house long, so
make the most of it. Answer questions when
asked and ask your own.

And one other thing. If you don’t get a bid
from a particular house, it isn’t the end of the
world. If they don’t want you, you probably
wouldn’t be happy with them. In those mat-
ters the house is probably the best judge. Put-
ting all your money on one house can be a
quick ticket to unhappiness. With our 16 dif-
ferent houses there is someplace for
everyone. Bo open—be yourself and you can
find that place.

From all my exhortations it sounds like
Rush is the next best thing to an all expense
paid vacation to Dachau. It really isn’t. It is a
hectic, exciting time which requires a great
deal of effort. For all its strangeness, though,
Rush can be fun, and with a little considera-
tion on both sides, it can be a very construc-
tive four weeks.

 

 
 

In Focus
Is Time Running Out On W&L’s Fraternity System?

 

Syd Farrar

 

Although the fraternity system at
Washington and Lee has been through many
conflicts and changes in the past two years,
including increased pressures from the alum-
ni, faculty and administration to mend our
ways, I feel that the fraternity system will
weather the storm and remain an important
part of student life at Washington and Lee.

The key for the fraternities to remain a
strong part of student life lies in the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The alumni, administra-
tion and especially the faculty, because they
stated such in their resolution passed last
spring, are looking for a fraternity system
which can govern itself within the rules and
regulations set forth in the Student Handbook.
The ability of the IFC and specifically the
Judicial Board to justly interpret and enforce
these rules while receiving the support of all
the fraternities will be very important in
the months to come.

 

Syd Farrar, a senior at Washington and Lee, is
president of the Interfraternity Council

 

The Faculty Motion passed in the spring left
the outcome of fraternity affairs in the hands
of the IFC and the fraternities. The faculty
does not want to directly administrate the
functions of each fraternity. The decision was
left up to the fraternities to govern
themselves.

I agree that the faculty established some
guidelines which all fraternities do not agree
with, but I do not see that we have any choice
but to try to honestly live within these
guidelines. The Faculty is very concerned
about the conflicts between academics and
social life within a fraternity and especially
the way in which a freshman, in the beginning
of the year during Rush, is hit with a party
system which he may construe is the norm in-
stead of the exception. Along these lines, the
Faculty is looking for a decrease in the size
and number if the weeknight parties.

The IFC has banned all house sponsored
weeknight parties as a result of this faculty
preference, but it has maintained the right of
a group of individuals to hold a party within a
fraternity house. A house is allowed to have a
house sponsored party two of the three weeks
of September to coincide with Rush. But after
this there will be no house sponsored
weeknight parties.

Another problem arising from the
weeknight parties is that the Lexington police
are denying any noise permits during the
week, reserving the right to issue them only
on weekends. A meeting with Chief of Police
Kirby and City Manager Doane this Wednes-
day will hopefully clear the air as to the
reason for this change along with letting the
fraternities know what the City of Lexington
will expect of fraternities this fall.

Last Spring I was worried that everyone
concerned with the University was against
the fraternity system. Fortunately, I was told
that this is not the case. The Faculty and Ad-
ministration, especially Dean John, Danny
Murphy and President Huntley were especial-
ly interested in our problems and in finding
solutions to them.

Perhaps the greatest amount of support
came from the Alumni Board and the Board
of Trustees. Through the years they have
given the fraternities a large amount of sup-
port through physical means in the approval
of low interest loans for for the upkeep of the
houses. Again in the spring they reiterated

Faculty Resolution of May, 1979

To the IFC, SAC, and the University Council:

The Faculty appreciates the constructive action toward more ef-
fective self-control of fraternities taken by the IFC and endorsed by
SAC and the University Council.

The Faculty concurs with the IFC’s position that self-regulation
by fraternities is preferable to rules the faculty might impose. And
it urges you to bear in mind the following observations.

Fraternities and fraternity members are to govern themselves in
accord with the following catalogue statement:

“Fundamental to all other aspirations of Washington and Lee
University are two basic purposes :

—the dedication of all its resources to the development of man’s
capacity and desire to learn, to understand, and to pass on to others
the varied benefits of this intellectual growth.

—the pursuit of its educational purpose in a climate of learning
that stresses the importance of the individual, his harmonious rela-
tionship with his fellow-man and his responsibility to serve society
through the productivity of his training and talent.

Fraternities undeniably add a dimension to student social life at
W&L; that dimension should complement the educational purposes
of the University. Mid-week party activities on fraternity premises
conflict with, rather than complement, academic life. The Faculty
feels confident you will, in the months to come, eliminate such con-
flicts. .

All initiation and pledge activities classifiable as hazing violate
the ‘importance of the individual, his personal honor and integri-
ty.” Inrecent years student reports to faculty about hazing have in-
creased in number and frequency; many of these reports describe
abhorrent actions degrading to the participants, actives as well as
pledges. You can, by open discussion and inquiry, bring your own
forms of pressure to bear upon those whose behavior disgraces the
entire fraternal system.

Excessive noise, ear-splitting live or recorded music, obscene
comments, and lewd or destructive conduct, whether in Lexington
or on neighboring campuses, violate a “‘harmonious relationship”’
with one’s fellow-man. Fraternities enjoy a generous compromise
in the matter of noise since fraternity neighbors generally tolerate
loud party music during weekend evening hours. Fraternities
must, however, respect their neighbors’ right to rest undisturbed in
the privacy of their homes during late night and early morning
hours.

The Faculty also anticipates your re-analysis of both the present
rushing system and the entire question of fraternities’ interference
with the freshman’s adjustment to academic demands. In the
months to come, faculty representatives on the University Council
and SAC will discuss these subjects with you.

The Faculty requests the University Council to submit before
January 7, 1980, a written report on the implementation of its policy
of May, 1979, and of its disciplinary actions taken to enforce that
policy. The Dean of Students should include in that report a list of
fraternity-related complaints including their general source,
nature, and disposition. The University Council is also to share with
the Faculty all results of the SAC investigations of fraternities’ role
in academic life and any steps the Council takes pursuant to that
report.

Reluctant but not unwilling to legislate directly upon any of these
matters, the Washington and Lee Faculty expresses its faith in this
institution’s students and in their desire to cooperate in achieving
the exalted goals common tous all.

The question is raised: has time run vut on
fraternities at Washington and Lee? The
question has a grisly side. It invites a worst-
case scenario: imagine all the seamy
episodes of the recent past associated with
fraternity men and lump them together.

The picture that results is enough to make
any serious student look for fresh air—public
drunkenness ; obscene language and gestures
and public urination at sporting events;
malicious and insulting remarks directed at
faculty members from house windows, doors
and balconies; loud weekend and week-night
parties disrupting academic purpose and
violating community sensibilities, if not the
law as well; lapses into physical violence and
grossly undignified behavior during fraterni-
ty initiations; house faculty advisors resign-
ing in disgust and despair, destruction of
fraternity house property and property at
near-by women’s colleges. Not so good, huh?

Washington and Lee University

 

This scenario is, of course, not unavoidable.
Most of the things mentioned above have not
been typical of all fraternities, or more than a
small handfull of individuals within any
single house.

It is puzzling to me why house officers have
so often been reluctant (unable?) to impose a
code of acceptable behavior and to enforce
house rules and some degree of discipline
within the brotherhood. Since the faculty
delegated self-government to the fraternities
in 1970, the machinery has been there. It is
probably only a short step to the point
wherein fraternities can meet a felt social
need and yet still meet their obligations as
organized groups within the university com-
munity. A fraternity need not be a roving
gang of rowdies. The time need not have run
out.

A new beginning will be for every present
and prospective fraternity man to read
carefully the faculty resolution enacted last
May 28th, rather than the curious misinter-
pretation that appeared in last year’s final
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. That resolution is
reprinted on this page, and attention is
directed particularly to those paragraphs
stating the university’s mission and stating
that fraternities are to govern themselves in
accordance. If the reader will then reconsider
the illustrations of fraternity un-, mal-, and
misbehavior described above, the contrast is
too vivid to ignore.

Between now and next January 7th much
can be done and much can be stopped. These
changes are best managed, in my view, by the
IFC and the fraternity houses themselves;
but the faculty has stated that it is ‘“‘not un-
willing” to do so if need be. There is still time.
At least I hope so.

certain improvements would be made, in- .

cluding increased improvement in the
physical appearance of the houses, the doing
away with any instances of hazing, and the
move for fraternities from being just a social
center to that of one which promotes
academic excellence as well.

With this solid support from those con-
nected with the University and with the in-
creased strength of the IFC through fraterni-
ty support I hope to see the fraternity system
noticeably strengthened as a result of the
events of the past year. After Rush the IFC,
with the help of all the fraternities and the
Student Affairs Committee, will conduct an
intensive self-study, which I also hope will
demonstrate to everyone the value of the

fraternity system at Washington and Lee
University.

Persiflage

This is it. This is my year.

I’m really going to settle down and work. Yes sir, I’m going to be
a studying fool, a veritable tome groupie.

Why, as soon as Rush ends I’ll be over at the library every night. I
figure that between the end of Star Trekand the beginning of the il-
legal mid-week parties I can really get some work done. .

My trouble last year was that I got too distracted. But after the
lecture my parents laid on me I’ve really reformed. I’ve set down
guidelines that I’m really going to stick to. No matter what, I’m
limiting myself to only two beers before dinner. I’m only going
down the road once a week, unless something really special comes
up. As for drugs, hey, only every once and awhile and then only if
its good stuff.

You see, it’s only a matter of discipline. If you tell yourself that
you only need a pint when you feel like a fifth you'll be able to cut
down. I just thank Bacchus that I was born with enough determina-
tion to fight off the desires of the flesh.

Renovations

Walking along Lee Street to
the Post Office one cannot help
but notice the huge Ann Smith
School adjacent to both Lee’s
Corner and the Post Office.

Few people realize that the
huge building is being con-
verted into the largest fraterni-
ty house at W&L, to be occupied
by W&L’s smallest fraternity,
Chi Psi.

Alumni from the national
chapter of Chi Psi are donating
money to pay for the renovation
and maintenance of the old
school.

According to Chi Psi Presi-
dent Sam Perkins, a national
representative is handling the
project through Pat Brady, the

 

(

University’s Plant’s Project

Manager.

The yard, which will even-
tually undergo landscaping, is
being maintained by Buildings
and Grounds.

At this time the gutters and
roof are being repaired.

Roof work is only part of what
Perkins calls “a multiphase
project.”’

When the project is finished,
possibly next fall, Chi Psi will
have a house with living
quarters for forty people.

WLUR Workshop

A month long summer pro-
gram for Lexington High School
students interested in the
management and operation of a
radio station was held last July
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

The program, sponsored by
Washington and Lee’s Jour-
nalism Department, was under
the direction of Robert J.
DeMaria, assistant professor of
journalism at W&L and
manager of WLUR, the Univer-
Sity’s radio station. DeMaria,
supervised the students who
learned techniques and pro-

blems of broadcasting manage-
ment while operating the sta-
tion.

“It was a great success. The
kids learned so much,” said
DeMaria. Now they are going to
see if they can form a radio club
at the high school which will
hopefully run WLUR during
vacations.

“This year,”’ said DeMaria,
“we will be doing regular
surveys:to poll the entire listen-
ing area. In 1967 the station was
conceived with a community
oriented philosophy. We are try-
ing to get back to that.”
