Washington and Lee University

Student Convicted Sat. In
Open Honor Hearing

by Randy Smith

A former Washington and Lee
senior was found guilty of an
honor offense last Saturday
after a lengthy student body
hearing in Lee Chapel.

After deliberating for over
two hours, a jury of 12 students
found the defendant guilty of
cheating on a pop quiz last spr-
ing.

The penalty for committing a
violation of W&L’s_ honor
system is expulsion.

An open student body hearing
is the appealate process after
the defendant has been found
guilty of an honor infraction ina

private hearing before the stu-
dent body Executive Co ittee.
Student body hearings are
open only to members of the
W&L community. Because .the
results of public honor hearings
are omitted from the student’s
record, and because the circula-
tion of the Ring-tum Phi ex-
tends beyond the boundaries of
the campus, the names of the

participants in the trial will not

be reported.

The defendant was accused of
cheating on a pop quiz worth
less than two percent of his final
grade in the course, according
to the testimony. Two students
were eyewitnesses to the alleg-
ed cheating incident. The

W&L Student Dead

In Apparent Suicide

A Washington and Lee
University junior died Tuesday
from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound in his Henry Street
apartment. He was an English
major at the college.

Hiland Newton Moore, 20, of
Lynchburg, was the son of Mrs.
George H. Fralin Jr., 600 Trents
Ferry Rd., and of the late H.N.
Moore Sr.

Rockbridge County Medical
Examiner Dr. F. A. Fedderman
ruled the death as suicide. The
time of death was tentatively
thought to have been between 10
p.m. and midnight Tuesday.
The body was ‘found shortly
before noon yesterday.

A graveside service will be
held at 11 a.m. Friday at Spr-

fraternity,) according to
figures supplied by Lewis G.
John, Dean of Students at the
university. In addition, 15 up-
perclassmen joined fraternity

ranks this month, bringing the

total figure up to 240 pledges.

Dean John noted that the
“rush yield” was down slightly
from last year’s figure of 65 per-
cent. No official reason has
been given for the decline;
however, several fraternity
spokesmen have pointed to a
new Interfraternity Council
rule as a possible source. Under
the new rushing procedure,
freshmen may not affiliate with
a fraternity until the third week
of the program. Previously,
pledging was allowed after one
week’s time. With the new
system in force, freshmen ap-
peared to move with greater
caution into the fraternity fold,
said a number of student
observers.

 

defense rested on the testimony
of the accused and a polygraph
expert.

The EC prosecuted the
former student, having already
found him guilty of cheating ina
private honor hearing. The pro-
secution presented ‘‘expert
testimony”’ to cast doubt on the
accuracy of polygraphs to
detect lies; the expert
documented a number of ways
to ‘‘beat the machine’’ and said
polygraphs are 65-75 percent ac-
curate in criminal detection.

In contrast, the defense
presented the defendant’s hired
polygraph examiner who said
that the machines are 90-98 per-
cent accurate in detection.

(Polygraph examinations are
admissible in Virginia courts if
both the prosecution and
defense agree to enter it into the
record before the test is ad-
ministered. )

There were great discrepen-
cies between the testimony of
the two eyewitnesses and the
defendant’s account of the inci-
dent. Both eyewitnesses were

Car, Other Items
Reported Stolen

by Sam Campbell

A student’s automobile,
stolen Oct. 8 from in front of the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house, has been recovered.

The car, belonging to junior
Andy Pick, was returned to
Lexington from a spot east of
Lexington on US Route 60,
where it was recovered. The
keys had been left in the car at
the time of the theft but were
missing when the car was
found.

Pick said he felt the police
handled the case well, but warn-
ed students to be careful.

‘“‘Burglars are getting more
aggressive,” he said. ‘“‘So much
stuff is getting stolen now, and
this was the biggest. I know now
that people should lock up their
cars.”’

Other robberies

Arobbery was reported at the
Sigma Phi Epsilon house.
Robert H. Forsyth told police
that his wallet, containing a
driver’s license, voter registra-
tion card, several ID cards,
meal tickets, and a small sum
of money was taken from his
room on the third floor of the
fraternity house on the after
noon of Oct. 22 while he was
sleeping.

No arrests have been made in
the case.

Another student had his car
battery stolen Thursday night
in the university parking lots in
front of Red Square.

The car, a 1966 Volkswagon
owned by senior Paul Nathan
lost the six volt battery at 2:15
a.m., the time shown on the
car’s electric clock. Replace-
ment costs total $40.45.

 

Survey Reveals Where Grades Are

 

by David Greer

Chemistry a gut course? You've got to be kid-

ding!

But more A’s are given in chemistry than
any other grade— 35 percent, to be exact.

According to a fact book compiled by the
university for the Fall Alumni Conference,
the most frequently received grade at W&L is
B. Of all the grades received last fall and
winter terms, 35 percent were B’s.

The Ring-tum Phi surveyed 16 depart-
ment’s grades for last year and found what
each department’s most frequently received
grade was. This guide will not be useful to
students looking for easy courses, though, as
grade frequency is not a measure of how
much work is required to get that grade. Ask
any pre-med.

The department that gave A’s most fre-
quently was Military Science, with 60 percent
of its grades being A’s. This was followed by
Drama at 57 percent, Music winter term at 46
percent, Chemistry at 35 percent, and Math
fall term at 26 percent.

Most of the courses were B courses. 47 per-

cent of the Music department’s grades fall
term were B’s, with the following courses in
decending frequency: Philosophy 45 percent,
Sociology 43 percent, History 41 percent, Art
40 percent, Journalism 39 percent,
Psychology 38 percent, Politics winter term
37 percent, Religion 36 percent, Accounting
winter term 36 percent and Math winter term
34 percent.

Of the courses giving C’s most frequently,
Politics winter term was the leader, with 38
percent of its grades: being C. The other
courses which had as their most frequently
bestowed grade the letter that starts the word
‘“Commerce”’:: Administration—36 percent,
Economics—34 percent, Accounting—fall
term—31 percent, and English—25 percent.

Only one department, Accounting (winter
term), had more F’s than A’s; 13 percent of
the total grades given in that department
were F’s while 8 percent were A's.

During Spring Term, B was still the most
frequently received grade at 35 percent of the
total, but A’s were received 31 percent of the
time while during the fall and winter A’s were
received 20 and 23 percent respectively.

Pres. Huntley On Fraternities

This is the last of a series of inter-
views with W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley. Ring-tum) Phi
News Editor David Greer inter-
viewed Huntley in September
about the fraternity system at
W&L. This article focuses on the
fraternities’ problems with noise,
conduct, and house maintenance.

RtP: What is the relative
shape of traternities today com-
pared to tive years ago?

Huntley: That's a very short
time span, and I am not sure
there has been any significant
change in the fraternity system
in a five-year term. I'm not
aware of any major deteriora-
tion in that time period or any
major improvement in it. Over
a longer time period, I'd say
there's been a_ deterioration
that probably began ten or so
years ago.

1 don't Know all the causes of
it. But I think whatever the
causes, - the changes” or
deterioration are manifested in
attitudes of less responsibility
for fraternity property. fre-
quently lack of concern for the
kind of conduct that occurs in
fraternities, and about the im-
pact of the conduct on the sen-
sibilities and the rights of those
who live near fraternities.

More important, more basic
than any of these, it seems to
me that many fraternities, not
all of them, I'm sure, but many
of them do not pay much atten-
tion to the deeper dimensions of
fellowship or friendship.

Now, that’s not to imply that
fraternities were ever perfect —
they certainly never were. No
human institution ever is. There
always were, examples and
episodes of fraternity
mismanagement and miscon-

duct and irresponsibilty that
came to the attention of the ad-
ministration.

The issue is not new. The oc-
casion for discussion of it is not
new. But I'm inclined to think
that there have been in the last
ten years less of the kind of
qualitively desirable fraternity

There have also been dif-
ficulties that fraternities in the
past might not have had. The
financing of the food service in
fraternities is more difficult
than it has ever been. It seems
to me that’s an area the Univer-
sity ought to try to help them in
any way we can.

‘““,.many fraternities do not pay much
attention to the deeper dimensions
of fellowship and friendship.”’

 

fellowship on the campus than
there was in a period, say, 25
years ago.

RtP: Have the efforts of the
IFC and students improved the
shape of the fraternities?

Huntley: It does appear to me
that there have been im-
provements. There are varying
views about that, depending on
whom you ask. I certainly have
made no personal inspection of
them so | am relying largely on
views that others have express-
ed.

An alumni committee that
was asked by the Alumni Board
of Directors to look into the
fraternity plant situation
reported last year that it has
seen definite improvement over
the last two years. The Alumni
still express great concern
about the condition of some of
the fraternities, but they did
note they have seen some
significant improvements.

I'm aware that some of the
houses are very old and have
not seen significant renovation
in a long time. Nevertheless,
that’s no excuse; for the house
that's the oldest and the least
renovated is probably the one
that requires the greatest care.
I doubt if lack of major renova-
tion is the basic problem.

After all that is said, there
has been a deterioration in the
houses, in the plant, that is not
merely explained by the houses
being old, or that the {66d ser-
vice is hard to come by. But I do
believe there has been'some im-
provement. When you'te living
in the middle of a trend it’s hard
to know you are.

RtP: Last year the frater-
nities made massive efforts to
cooperate with the town in
regards to the noise ordinance,
which, granted, is a law and is
being violated but is considered
unreasonable.

Huntley: There certainly
were efforts to cooperate; how
massive they were might be a
difference in perspective be-
tween the fraternity members
and the people who live in town.
I don't know if the ordinance is
unreasonable, but there cer-
tainly is more than one side to
the question.

The constant noise level that
has eminated from fraternities
for a number of years has
reached a point where it has ex-
hausted the toleration level of
Lexington citizens. Whenever
that occurs, you can expect
some reaction. This is a small
community, which is largely
very tolerant of the activities of
students.

Lacrosse Team

Pushing A Bed To

Most veterans of the Road
Trip know that the dreary drive
home is a task no one likes to
face but usually must. Hotels
are too expensive and overnight
lodging at girl's schools is often
difficult to arrange.

I think what you're really
dealing with is the desire of peo-
ple who live in close juxtaposi-
tion to each other to get along
together. That requires some
give and take on both sides.

RtP: Do you think frater-
nities have made enough effort?

Huntley: I think some made
that effort last year. Of course,
I'm aware that even if a frater-
nity makes an effort there may
be some who may not, and those
who don't tend to be the ones
who are thought of as being all
fraternities. One fraternity can
affect the image of them all.
That's just a fact of life. It’s just
as unfortunate fact that one or
two fraternities, behaving in a
way that as seen by those living
around it as_ being
unreasonably, will affect the
images and hence the privileges
of all the others. Just as
students will tend to associate
with the community of Lex-
ington its most unreasonable
members so the community will

tend to see fraternities in terms
of its least responsible
members.

Rtp: Do you perceive that the
town’s tolerance is running out?

Huntley: Yes, I think it is,
again speaking in a ten-year
time span. That's one of the
messages I tried to pass on to
the IFC, that the time for frater-
nities to improve both the fact
and image of their existence
was at hand.

I am also aware of the fact
that the students here are not
the ones primarily responsible
for tarnishing the image of
fraternities. That may strike
some as unfair, but if it’s unfair
it’s not an unfairness to anyone
who can't do anything about it.

tempt to push a bed on wheels
from Lexington to Hollins along
US Route tH on Sunday, Nov. 4.

John Hooper, co-captain of
the lacrosse team, said the
team will work in shifts on the
trip, estimated to take 10-12
hours. The bed-push will start
at5a.m.

Hooper said the bed-push will
be attempted rain or shine. He
said he is not sure yet who may
be invited to ride in the bed.

The team is asking students
to pledge money to the team for
every mile it pushes the bed.
Pledges can be made to any
member of the lacrosse team.

Hooper said the team will
plan a party at Hollins to
celebrate the feat.

When asked why the team
picked pushing a bed to Hollins,
Hooper said, ‘‘What else are
you going to push?”’

How W&L’s Professors Are Granted Tenure

by Mike Perry

The following article is the first
in a series evaluating the pro-
cedure under which tenure is
granted at Washington and Lee.
This initial story provides a
description of and background
surrounding the tenure proce-
dure. Upcoming articles will in-
clude interviews with instructors
and administrators and an
analysis of tenure at W&L—its
successes and failures.

Tenure has had a widespread
influence in the contemporary
American educational scene.
Virtually all instructors from
kindergarten teachers to uni-
versity department chairmen
work under a contract that in-
cludes some provision for
tenure.

Whether seen as a safeguard
of academic freedom or simply
compensation for a relatively
low pay scale, tenure means job
security.

Although the attainment of
tenure generally means that
faculty members cannot be
removed from their teaching
positions without due cause,
there are likely to be as many
definitions of due cause and
practical applications of the
tenure principle as there are
tenure clauses in teachers’ con-
tracts across the nation.

For an overview of the role
tenure plays in the hiring and
firing practices here at
Washington and Lee, we con-
sulted the September 1979 edi-
tion of the Faculty Handbook.

New Faculty

New faculty member con-
tracts are awarded as term ap-
pointments, or ‘‘an appoint-
ment for a specified period of
time (one or more years), or an
appointment which
automatically renews -from
year to year until further
notice,”’ according to the Facul-
ty Handbook,

After serving on the faculty
for seven years, generally in the
form of one or more term ap-
pointments, those faculty mem-
bers initially appointed as In-
structor or Assistant Professor
will be considered for a tenure
appointment.

Exceptions to this policy in-
clude appointees who have
served on the faculty of another
institution for more than three
years; their term appointments
may only be for as long as four
years, and those faculty mem-
bers appointed initially to the
rank of Associate Professor or
Professor need only two years
of service before receiving
tenure consideration.

Promotion to the rank ot
Associate Professor or Pro-
fessor following an initial term
appointment to a lesser rank is
also ‘deemed to confer tenure
unless accompanied by an ex-
plicit written agreement to the
contrary.” Faculty members
may also be hired with tenure.

   

What It Means
All faculty members, as
stated in the Faculty Handbook,

“upon receiving a tenure ap-
pointment...shall have perma-
nent and continuous tenure,
which is defined as meaning
that his service shall not be ter-
minated or his academic rank
reduced except for adequate
cause, or because of attainment
of the established retirement
age, or under extraordinary cir-
cumstances because of finan-
cial exigencies.”’

This provision is not ap-
plicable to administrative posi-
tions and a_ teaching ad-
ministrator may be removed
from his administrative posi-
tion, but not from his teaching
position subject to policy re-
garding academic tenure.

Faculty members holding
tenure appointments may only
be removed with the approval
of the Board of Trustees of the
University who have recognized
the functional purpose of tenure
as “‘to create an atmosphere of
mutual goodwill and dedication
in achieving a stimulating in-
tellectual exchange between
members of the University
Community,” according to the
Faculty Handbook.

Decision Process

One measure of the im-
portance accorded tenure at
W&L is the involved decision
process used as a basis in grant-
ing tenure appointments.

The Department Head and
the tenured members of the de-
partment all voice their input to
the President’s Advisory Com-
mittee, consisting of three

elected faculty members and
the three academic deans, who,
in turn, issue a recommenda-
tion to the President of the
University. The President then
formulates a recommendation
which he submits to the Board
of Trustees for their approval.

If it seems that a great deal of
time and consideration is given
a candidate for tenure it is done
with good reason: dismissal of a
tenured faculty member is a
very difficult and involved
process.

“Adequate cause for a dis-
missal will be related, directly
and substantially, to the fitness
of the faculty member in his

professional capacity as a
teacher and researcher,” ac-
cording to the Faculty Hand-
book.

 

Dismissal of a tenured faculty
member must follow a discus-
sion ‘with appropriate ad-
ministrative officers looking
toward a mutual settlement and
an informal inquiry by the
President’s Advisory Commit-
tee whose opinion is not binding
upon the President.’’

Actual dismissal comes from
the President in a statement of
charges.

The accused faculty member
can dispute the President’s
dismissal decision in a hearing
before an Ad Hoc Committee
comprised of five elected facul-
ty members.

The faculty members also has

the option of waiving such a the P

hearing and presenting his case
to a hearing tribunal for their
recommendation.

Like A Trial

Should the faculty member
opt for a hearing, a procedure
not unlike that used in an open
student honor trial is followed
with the hearing committee de-
ciding whether the hearing
should be public or private.

Both the accused faculty
member and the President are
permitted to have legal counsel
present as well as provide
witnesses and forms of
evidence.

Any decision by the hearing
committee, whether to sustain
ident’ mmenda-

    

tion, overturn it or lessen the
penalty is passed on to the
President of the University.

The committee’s findings are
subject to the approval of the
Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees. The Ex-
ecutive Committee will review
the hearing taking into account

any specific objections or new
evidence. The Executive Com-
mittee also has the option of
returning the case to the hear-
ing committee with specific ob-
jections and new evidence.

The Executive Committee’s
action is presented to the Board
of Trustees for ratification.

W&L To Host Italian Sculpture

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s duPont Gallery will pre-
sent sculptures by Bruno Luc-
chesi beginning Monday, Oct.
29, and continuing through Fri-
day, Nov. 23, in duPont Hall on
the north edge of the college
campus.

The exhibition is composed of
“genre sculptures,’’ which are
story-telling groups dealing
with everyday people and situa-
tions. The majority of the
figures are in bronze, and treat
a variety of subjects, from
Italian housewives on a balcony
to a collection of weary
travelers waiting at a transit
station.

The noted art crrtic Thomas
S. Buechner commented recent-
ly that Lucchesi’s ‘‘attitudes,
influences and skills are both

natural and contemporary,”’ .

although he was raised in the
classical traditions of
Renaissance art. As a result of
this fortunate blend, Buechner
says Lucchesi and his craft
reach a level of competence
‘seldom achieved — or even
sought — in these days. This
craft is all-embracing in a
Renaissance sense — not only
does it include the intricacies of

High Prices And Radio
Play Hurt Album Sales

by Mark Kinniburgh

The fall selection of record
releases are now veryavailable
with the notable exception of
Bruce Springsteen, and even
without an addition from
Ashbury Park, there are plenty
of nice music buys in the store
racks.

Along with the normal record
promotion hype that is going on,
radio is an integral part of
whether an album becomes a
“success” or not. A major pro-
blem has surfaced this year
particularly, and it involves
these new releases and the
radio stations.

To explain through example,
take Led Zeppelin’s latest
album on Swan Song records.
As soon as the album was
released on August 20th, 1979,
every major radio station in the
country bombarded the album
with airplay and attention. On
that evening, almost everyone
in the country could have heard
the entire album, _uninter-
rupted, as it was presented in a
feature spot from coast to coast.

Here’s the problem. A record
company makes money through
record sales revenue, and the
$8.98 list price has made it dif-
ficult to insure mass sales of
even a popular album. To add to
the sales difficulty, a radio sta-
tion plays the entire album one
evening, and a listener with a
good FM radio and cassette
deck gets a copy of the album
for the price of a cassette.

Chris Pool of Fantasia
Records and Tapes in Arl-
ington, Texas complains this
way “I wish I knew how many
record sales are lost in this area

 

 

Movie Review

Monty Python’s Latest

Is A Disappointment
by Dash Coufal

 

MONTY PYTHON’S THE LIFE
OF BRYAN

Written and performed by
Grahm Chapman, John Cleese,
Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry
Jones, and Michael Palin.
Directed by Terry Jones.
Animations by Terry Gilliam.

Funny and sacriligious! The
Life of Bryanis the story of a
Jew named Bryan who was
born on the same day as Christ.

Bryan grows up to join the
Hebrew underground and
become entangled with the
Romans. Quite as a fluke he is
taken as the Messiah and ac-
quires a following.

In the end he is crucified
despite numerous attempts to
save him. Which all goes to
show that the Romans can’t
take a joke.

Funny as it is, Bryan can’t
hold a candle to Monty Python’s
earlier work. The problem is ob-

vious: The Life of Bryan tries to
have a coherent story (unlike
anything they’ve done before)
and thus misses out on the
sillyness, insanity, and hillarity
of their previous disjointed
works.

The only totally extraneous
sequence is one with some
aliens, one of the funniest
scenes in the film, whereas The
Holy Grail was rife with mean-
ingless bits that failed to tie in
with the mainstream of the
movie.

Gilliam’s animations are us-
ed only in the credits, and while
they are more polished and air-
brushed than before, they
aren't half as funny. One of the
funniest parts of the TV show
and The Holy Grail was the con-
stant interruption by the
animated sequences.

The funniest thing Monty
Python’s ever done was the TV
series, which dealt with the pre-
sent rather than with quasi-

historical material. Who do
their movies depart from this
format to indulge in less funny
costume dramas? Why cant’t
they make a movie about
modern day London, an easier
target for lampooning?

As actors, once again the
Python crew is impeccable.
Each of them plays many roles,
and each role is clearly
characterised.

Some of the roles are
hilarious in themselves: such as
the lisping Roman counsel and
his “‘fwend Biggious Dickious,”’
the mad jailer, the man who
picks his nose, and the man who
contends that the Romans can’t
take a joke.

Also, I should mention that
Carol Cleveland, one of the few
real women in the cast, must be
ranked with Margret Dumont
(who played opposite the Marx
Brothers) as one of the most
tolerant and long suffering
women in history.

from the local radio stations
playing both sides of new LP
releases...d.j’s really don’t
have to tell people to get their
tape recorders ready.”’ Record
retailers at this level are really
hurting because of radio
overplay, and it sends shock
waves up to the company ex-
ecutives themselves.

The company cannot function
if the album doesn’t get any
airplay, so there is a trade-off
point. I would recommend
lowering the price of the albums
themselves, to make them
economically feasible for the
majority of record consumers.
If the list price of an album
were $4.98, and discount con-
sumer outlets sold the album
for, say, $3.99, there would pro-
bably be double the album sales
than at a list price of $8.98.

Another advantage of the
lower list price would be that
lesser-known artists would get a
better chance in the retail
market, where it is now certain
death for a young artist, if the
“hit” on the album does not sell
the entire album.

In the past, the major labels
found out that an unknown is not
going to make it at an $8.98 list
price, because the consumer
won’t risk the money. Now, for
the test — will the new Fleet-
wood Mack album ‘‘Tusk”’ sell
at a $15.98 list price?

There are some labels which
are trying to get around the
high-cost barrier to albums by
lesser knowns. Atco for one is
the pioneer in the $5.98 list price
field. Sire records, on the other
hand, seems to take beatings
financially on every venture,
the latest of which is a release
by the Alda Reserve Band.

This is the kind of band that is
good, but not really an attention
grabber like a Ramones or
Blondie. They are destimed to
be FM radio children and not
much more, especially to the
Sire folks. Notes: The reason
Springsteen’s album is being
held up until the new year is
that the record label doesn’t
want to compete with the
Eagles and Fleetwood
Mack...Gary Numan will be
touring this February, ac-
cording to Atco records, concur-
rent with the new release in
January of ‘Passion Play’’...

Enjoying Our
Little Game

By Ray McNulty
Sports Editor
Dear Readers,

It has come to our attention that there are some
students who are dissatisfied with the sports section
of the Ring-tum Phi. The criticism have ranged from
our ‘monumental waste of space’’ — our Grid Picks
— to our lack of school spirit.

First, let me entertain the complaint that our Grid
Picks column is a waste of space. This year at the
Ring-tum Phi, especially in the sports department,
we are trying to make the school paper more appeal-
ing than it has been in the past. For that reason, we
have decided to try new and different ideas, i.e. Grid
Picks, This Week In Sports, a wider range of sports
coverage and better layout.

Contrary to minority opinion, these additions to the
section have met with at least some degree of suc-
cess. Students have found the sports calendar helpful,
they are enjoying our wider range of coverage and —
believe it or not — they are reading our Grid Picks.
(Whether or not they agree with our picks is irrele-
vant.)

As for our success at picking winners, both Mr.
Whalen and I have been correct just less than 60 per-
cent of the time. Compared to the records of the pro-
fessionals, we are not doing too badly. (We also
choose only games that are expected to be a close con-
test.) And for our being informed, both Mr. Whalen
and I are ardent football fans and try to keep abreast
of the latest sports news.

The letter to the editor in last week’s edition of the
Phi accused Mr. Whalen and I of having no school
spirit. The author of that letter was obviously a mis-
informed babbler with an urge to publicize his ig-
norance.

Had he first researched his claim, he would have
found out that Mr. Whalen and I are both firm sup-
porters of W&L athletics. He would have found that
Mr. Whalen has attended every athletic event he was
capable of attending, rooting for the Generals. As for
myself, I have worked at the Sports Information Of-
fice for four years turning out PR material about
W&L sports. In addition, I have also played on the
varsity and JV lacrosse teams. Had he looked even
further, he would have seen that in most of our com-
mentaries, we are very supportive of W&L sports.

Also, if we did not have any school spirit, it is doubt-
ful that Mr. Whalen and I would bother to take the
time (and it takes up a lot of it) to put together an in-
formative and interesting sports section for the
students to read every week.

We have been attacked for criticizing W&L athletic
teams and for picking the football team to lose in our
Grid Picks column. We have been criticized for not
saying nice things about the teams even when they
lose or play poorly. These attacks are accurate — but
so are our criticisms.

The Ring-tum Phi is not a public relations sheet for
W&L sports. Mr. Whalen and I both consider
ourselves journalists — objective journalists. We can-
not let our biases for W&L affect our stories. If there
are students out there who disagree with this
philosophy and just want to read positive things about
W&L, they can stop by the sports information office

Water polo coach Page Remillard discusses strategy during a short break in weekend action. The
Generals went unbeaten in Southern Conference play to boost their season record to 13-2.

Tourney Sweep Gives

Water Polo 13-2 Mark

by Dave Johnson

If you enjoy sports and you
were on the W&L campus Satur-
day afternoon, then you should
have been at the Cy Twombly
pool watching the Generals tak-
ing on Richmond in water polo.
For the first time in nine years,
W&L beat Richmond 6-5 in over-
time.

The victory over Richmond
was W&L’s fourth win of the
weekend, the others coming
against VMI, Duke, and UNC
(Chapel Hill), bringing the
General’s record to an im-
pressive 13-2. The team has
received votes for the NCAA
Top Ten for the past two weeks
and after the weekend’s games,
they are sure to be awarded
that distinction once again,

The games were played Fri-
day and Saturday in the second
half of the Southern Water Polo
League Tournament: a
qualification tournament for
the Southern League Champion-
ships — to be played at W&L
Nov. 2-3. Last weekend’s
games, along with five wins two
weeks earlier at Richmond,
earned the Generals the top
seed in the Championships.

W&L’s first game was against
VMI Friday afternoon. The
Generals totally dominated the
game and won it by a 16-1 score.

Despite the easy victory,
W&L coach Page Remillard
had good things to say about the
VMI team. ‘‘They have some
skilled athletes, and with a little
more time they could put
together a_ seriously com-
petitive team,’’ said the coach.

The W&L’s second game of
the tournament was much
closer and exciting as the
Generals battled to a 10-9 vic-
tory over Duke University.
W&L trailed for most of the
game due to what Remillard
called ‘forced’ play and a
“failure to execute’.

Throughout the game, W&L
was plagued by offensive tur-

novers which kept them from
generating any offense. The last
two minutes of the game saw
the Generals turn around and
show the way that they are
capable of playing, however.

W&L’s next victim was the
UNC team, which was polished
off 15-1. One reason for the lop-
sided score was the absence of
several key players from the
UNC lineup. Another reason
was the fine offensive play of
Drew Pillsbury, who scored a
total of seven goals, four of
which came on assists from co-
captain Biff Martin.

Also having an impressive
game was goalie Will Hodges,
who held UNC scoreless
through almost three full
periods. The defensive effort
was led by the squad’s other
captain, Mike Foley.

Then came the big game:
W&L versus Richmond. The
Generals jumped out to an early
4-1 lead on the strength of a very
mobile offense. This aggressive
offensive play was also respon-
sible for getting the Richmond
team into deep foul trouble.
Good defense by Richmond
allowed them to come back
strong and tie the game at the
end of regulation play, 4-4.

The game was still tied at the
close of the first overtime
period, as each team scored
once. W&L scored the winning
goal with about a minute left in
the second overtime period to
end this exciting game.

The standout player of the
game was Bob Newcomb whose
defensive efforts, along with
those of Foley and Trip
Johnstone, were, in Remillard’s
words, ‘‘the key to the victory’’.

Remillard was extremely
pleased with the victory and
points to this game as ‘‘the one
that makes W&L a true con-
tender in water polo.” He also
was very happy with the fan
support for the big games of the
weekend, during which the 500
seat gallery was filled almost to
capacity with very vocal fans.

He called the support
“motivational”, saying: ‘We:
really appreciated the support
by the faculty and the frater-
nities, and we hope that support
will continue.”

The water polo Generals will
face Richmond again this
weekend, in the Virginia State
Championships at Richmond,
followed by the Southern
League Championships.

Generals Beat Roanoke As
Halcomb Gets 3rd Shutout

by Bill Whalen

The Washington & Lee soccer
team made it two in a row
yesterday with a 1-0 victory
over Roanoke College. The win
moved the Generals to within
one game under .500 with three
games remaining in the season.

‘People have written us off,”’
said coach Rolf Piranian, ‘‘but
we're 4-5-1 and going after
Lynchburg.’’ The Generals play
Lynchburg, a 9-2-1 team, this
Saturday.

From the beginning of the
game, it appeared to be all
W&L. The Generals controlled
the ball deep in Maroon ter-
ritory and rarely let Roanoke
get past midfield.

Throughout the first part of
this period, however, the
Generals missed several scor-

 

ing opportunities. The constant ing the shutout fell on freshman

    
 

pressure from corner and in-
direct kicks soon payed off,
however.

With 20:30 left in the first half,
W&L scored the game’s only
goal off one such opportunity.
Freshman forward Brad Poor-
man lofted a shot from the cor-
ner and into the goal crease,
where junior forward Mark
Turner took charge and headed
the ball into the right corner of

the net.
While the Generals had a

relatively easy first half, the se-
cond half proved to be a more
harrowing experience. All the
close calls which were going
W&L’s way in the first half were
now going against them.

The result of this was alot of
pressure put on the General’s
defense. The chore of preserv-

General Doug Piunote goes up for the ball in soccer action against Mary Washington College. Tri-
captain Doug Seitz lends support.

goalie Rody Halcomb.

Halcomb, who recorded his
third shutout in his fourth start
in goal, resonded by stopping all
of Roanoke’s 13 second half
shots. On the day, the Generals
were outshot 18-17.

‘Rody Halcomb played
another outstanding game for
us,”’ said Piranian, ‘‘We’re also
getting better defense — which
always helps.”’

Still, Piranian expressed
some worry over his team’s of-
fensive performance. ‘‘We’re
still not getting our goals,”’ add-
ed the coach,” and we'll have to
work on that.”’

The Generals’ last three
opponents are Lynchburg,
Virginian Wesleyan and VMI.
The VMI game is also the last
home game of the season.

Booters Dump MWC
On Brown’s Late Goal

by Chris Sisto

Last Saturday, the varsity
soccer team executed its third
shutout of the season in a 1-0
victory over Mary Washington
College. The win improved the
Generals’ overall record to
3-5-1.

Against Mary Washington the
team had several opportunities
to score but tallied only once
when Bill Brown, assisted by
Chris Daniel, put in a shot with
only 5:10 remaining in the
game.

W&L Coach Rolf: Piranian
was pleased by his team’s
superb defensive effort. ‘‘Our
defense played great,’ Pira-
nian said.

“They didn’t allow Mary
Washington any significant
scoring opportunities,” added
the coach. They had sixteen

shots on goal and none of them

really threatened.”

The only exception to this was
a penalty kick by Mary
Washington following a ques-
tionable call late in the second
half.

With about ten minutes re-
maining in the game several
players from both teams went
scrambling for the ball in front
of the Generals’ net.

A Generals’ defenseman was
penalized for taking an oppo-
nent off the ball and Mary
Washington was awarded a
penalty kick.

This kick was beautifully
stopped by Generals’ goalie
Rody Halcomb. Preserving the
shutout seemed to spark the of-
fense. Several minutes later,
Brown put in his winning goal.

Piranian, was still not

satisfied with his team’s offen-

sive output, however. Several

times early in the game,
General forwards Ben Muskin
and Mark Turner could not
capitalize on chances to score.

Piranian stated about his of-
fense: “It is definitely not a
lack of effort from our offensive
players; it is just that they are
inexperienced.”

The Generals hope to improve
this situation by Wednesday
when they face rival Roanoke
College. This is the 40th meeting
between the two teams and is
also an ODAC match. Piranian
feels confident his team can win
if the Generals can get more of-
fensive output.

In other soccer notes the
Generals’ ‘‘B’’ soccer team tied
Valley United College, 2-2,
Saturday, running their record
to 2-4-1. Their next opponent is
Eastern Mennonite, in a match
to be played today.

Commentary:

T.V. Torture

by Bill Whalen
Ass’t. Sports Editor

Last Saturday was one of those rare occasions at
W&L it-was a sports smorgasbord day. In the period
of one day, there was too many things going on at the
same time for the avid sports fan to keep up with.

 

After a leisurely noon lunch, the sports freak could
have marched out to Wilson Field where the J.V. soc-
cer team was playing. If he found this to be too boring,
he might find the nearest T.V. set and park himself on
the sofa, to be entertained by an afternoon of college
football, which started at 12:30 p.m.

But all this bliss ended at 3 p.m., when complica-
tions began to set in. ‘Should I stay with Notre Dame-
USC or should I listen to the W&L game?”’ he asked
himself.

At this point, a major commitment had to be made.
Take it from the voice of experience, it’s impossible to
watch a game on T.V. while listening to another on the
radio. Eventually, you’ll find yourself too wrapped up
in one game to understand what’s happening in the
other.

I opted for the W&L game and, as it happened, I
made the right choice. While USC was putting the
screws to Notre Dame, I was listening to W&L losing
a true heartbreaker, 15-14.

Of course, my motives were not purely instinctive.
The Fighting Irish was one of my least favorite teams
and I was deathly afraid that they would upset USC -
the school with my favorite fight song and the best
looking group of cheerleaders.

(Editor’s Note - Princess Margaret of England
recently said that the Irish were ‘‘pigs.’’ How about
that! Princess Margaret is a USC fan?)

The W&L game left me depressed but not for long
when I remembered that the second half of ABC’s
football doubleheader was Texas-Arkansas. So I rush-
ed to the tube and did I see the Longhorns and the
Razorbacks? Nope, UNC - N.C. State.

But Saturday was not the first time this has happen-
ed to me. Other past disappointments include NBC’s
replacement of the Steelers-Browns game with the
Jets and the Colts matchup. And who can forget last
year’s gem when ABC cancelled USC-UCLA in favor
of that annual fall classic — Furman vs. Appalachian
State.

Moves like these make me wander about the in-
telligence of television programmers. These last
minute substitutions are not caused by popular de-
mand, but are the result of trying to get better ratings
through ‘‘regional’’ broadcasts.

A reasonable argument can be made that we are in
the same broadcast region as Appy State and UNC.
But how can the networks claim that Baltimore and
Roanoke support the same teams? Look at a map.
Baltimore, not even the closest NFL city, is almost
275 miles from the nearest Roanoke stations.

At least some sort of justice prevailed in the
Baltimore case. While the Colts were playing in one of
the dullest games of the season (which usually hap-
pens when an 0-5 team plays a 2-3 team), the Steelers
and the Browns had the highest scoring game of the

Say goodbye to the principle of providing the public
with the best available entertainment. Profits, not
performance, are what control television sports-
viewing today.

Who suffers the most in this conflict of interests?
The viewers, of course.

as possible scouting terrain
before the opening day. Com-
petition will be keen that first
week but the well-prepared
hunter will have a distinct ad-
vantage over those whose first
step in the woods this year are
on opening day.

For Washington & Lee
hunters, the first problem en-
countered, when scouting for
game, is finding some land to
scout on. The federal and state
governments maintain
thousands of acres of prime
hunting land for public use.

These lands, though often
miserably overcrowded on
opening day, are usually
deserted after the first week of
the season. Much of this land is
in easy reach of Lexington. The
Goshen-North Mountain
Wildlife Area is controlled by
The Va. Game Commission and
has 16,000 acres open to public
hunting. Turkey, grouse and
deer are abundant in this area
which has several convenient
access trails. Maps of the public
land are available from the
Pedlar River Ranger District
Office in Buena Vista. The
state-owned Lake Robertson
Area has 500 acres open to
public hunting. Deer and
turkeys can be found in this
area as well as several coveys
of quail. Maps may be obtained
in Buena Vista. Perhaps the
largest tract of public hunting
land in this area is found on the
George Washington National
Forest. This immense area is
located on either side of the
Blue Ridge Parkway north of
the James River.

Game of all species abound in
this area, including some of the
state’s best bear hunting land.
Maps are available at the
Buena Vista Ranger’s Office.

The Jefferson National
Forest is found on the southeast
side of the James River in the
Arnold’s Valley area. This land
is similar to the Washington Na-
tional Forest in that it is very
large and has excellent hunting.
Maps can be obtained at the
Glenwood Ranger District Of-
fice in Natural Bridge.

Sewanee Edges W&L
As Defense Falters

By Dale Park

For W&L football, it has been
a season of ups and downs. The
Generals came off with a spec-
tacular win against Hampden-
Sydney two weeks ago, only to
be tripped up in the final
minutes by Sewanee, 15-14.

Sewanee, the University of
the South, avenged its loss last
year at the hands of the
Generals and dropped W&l’s
overall record to 2-5.

The Generals played an un-
characteristically sub-par
game defensively. “We were
not ready to play,” said Head
Coach Gary Fallon. ‘We may
have been overconfident — we
tackled poorly, allowing their
running backs to pick up yar-
dage on second and third ef-
forts.”

Yet if the defense had its pro-
blems, the offense continued to
show signs of improvement. By
alternating quarterbacks Jim
Wenke and Chris Cavalline, the
Generals improved their pass-
ing and option attack.

Freshman Cavalline also ran
the bootleg effectively several
times, picking up 30 yards in six
carries. ‘‘Cavalline has the
speed to make the option plays
go,”’ said Fallon. ‘“‘We’re gain-
ing more confidence in him all
the time.”

Kicking proved to be an im-
portant factor in the General’s
joss. While being pinned in their
own territory by deadly punts,
W&L game Sewanee good field
position through poor kicks.

The game started on a good
defensive note. Late in the first
quarter the Generals’ goal-line
stand held Sewanee for three
plays, finally forcing and
recovering a fourth and goal
fumble on the two-yard line.

The’ field position was less
than opportune however.
Several plays later, junior slot-
back Chris Leiser was nailed
for a safety, making the score
2-0 Sewanee. The safety proved
to be the deciding two points in
the game.

Two possessions later,
Sewanee engineered a six-play,
42-yard drive ending in an eight
yard touchdown scramble by
Sewanee quarterback Holland.
The successful point-after
boosted the score to 9-0
Sewanee.

Although allowing 244 yards
rushing, the Generals
themselves compiled 198 yards
on the ground, due mostly to
senior tailback Stu Atkinson.
Atkinson gained 161 yards on 31
carries and was the major

figure in two impressive W&L
scoring drives.

Starting late in the first half,
Cavalline took the Generals
from mid-field to the Sewanee
five, depending heavily on the
running of Atkinson. The drive
was capped off by a five-yard
Cavalline touchdown pass to
tight end Syd Farrar with 2:05
left in the half. The successful
conversion cut the Tiger’s lead
to 9-7.

At this point and for most of
the second half, the W&L
defense stiffened. Led by a pair
of freshmen, linebacker Phil
Alletto .and defensive back
Barry Thompson, Sewanee net-
ted zero yards through the air
all afternoon.

Midway through the third
quarter the Generals were on
the move again. Cavalline took
his team to the Sewanee 39 yard
line in six plays. The drive was
completed when Atkinson raced
the remainder of the field for
the touchdown. The Generals
now lead, 14-9.

Once again what seemed to be
the perfect scenario for a come-
from-behind W&L victory was
ruined by the Generals’ inabili-
ty to stop its opponents final and
decisive drive.

In a long, 14-play series,
Sewanee plodded downfield to
score a one-yard run. The two
point conversion attempt failed,
leaving the score 15-14 in favor
of the Tigers with 4:35 left in the
game. “The Sewanee backs
were very tough and converted
several fourth down situa-
tions,” said Fallon.

Trying to come back, the
Generals were able to drive to
the Sewanee 36 yard line. Faced
with a fourth and eleven situa-

tion, W&L opted to go for the
first down, with Sophomore
Rich Hachenburg now at
quarterback.

‘‘A field goal would have been
50 yards-plus into the wind,”
said Fallon. ‘Instead we opted
for a first down try. Hachen-
burg is particularly familiar
with the pass play we ran,
which is why he came into the
game.”

The pass, and with it the
Generals’ hopes for victory, fell
just short.

Next week the Generals face
Bridgewater College at home.
Fallon said, ‘the game should
be interesting in that
Bridgewater is number-one
against the rush in the 0.C.A.C.
while we are the top rushing
team in the conference.’’
Bridgewater was relatively
unhurt by graduation, with 15 of
last year’s 22 starters return-
ing.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. at
Wilson Field.

EC Investigates
Campus Security

by Joe Scott

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed three of its members to
a new subcommittee dealing
with campus security at Mon-
day’s short session.

The decision was reached
after lengthy debate over the
Ring-tum Phi’s Oct. 18 security
editorial.

“It kind of blasted us,’’ said
Sophomore Representative
Nelson Ould about the editorial.
He added that a response from
the EC might be considered.

“‘We are not a police force,”’
said EC President Steve
Abraham. “‘I would be willing to
talk to Huntley about it,” he
added but we can’t deal with
these student problems unless

_ they come to us. The EC’s job

though is ‘“‘to cover any pro-
blems of the students.’’

“T think the Phi’s assumption
(security problem) is just that
— an assumption,” said Third
Year Law Rep. John Fraser. “‘I
would be willing to work on a
subcommittee to look into this,”’
he added.

Fraser will head the commit-
tee. Ould and Junior Rep. Bruce
Poole are also looking into the
matter. They will report back to
the EC on Nov. 12. (See letter to
the editor, page 10).

Run-off elections for two

freshman class positions ended
in victory for Edmund

Schenecker and James Averett.

 

Schenecker won the EC
Representative race with a
total of 101 votes and Averett,
now Freshman Class President,
won with 126 votes cast.

In other EC business, appoint-
ments for the Student Health
Committee and the University
Athletic Committee were ap-
proved with the newly opened
positions going to David
Williamson, who assured the
EC that he had time to devote to
health matters, and Thomas
Wall, who said it would be good
for the school if we looked into
the possibility of athletically
competing with Ivy League Col-
leges. Being the only students to
apply for the positions the EC
unanimously voted them in.

Bill Ridge, co-chairman of the
Students Activities Board,
reported on the SAB’s past
meeting. Ridge said they had
talked about the problem of get-
ting a projectionist for-Sunday
films and have postponed
discussion of Fancy Dress until
next week.

Ridge said that 26 students
had applied for SAB positions
but only five or six would be ac-
cepted. The final decision will
be given at a future meeting of
the SAB.

Thomas Spencer, the EC’s
lawyer, was reported to have
drafted a letter to all bad check
offenders specifying that legal
action will be taken if replies
are not received in ten days.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Notes On The Trial

After last spring’s carnival-like open honor hear-
ing, the serious approach taken by all concerned in
Saturday’s proceeding was a reassuring affirmation
of the strength of Washington and Lee’s honor
system. There are no doubts here that justice was ful-
ly rendered during the 13-hour-long hearing.

The proceeding was ably run by Bill Garrett, presi-
dent of the Student Bar Association, who correctly
allowed both sides the necessary time to present all
their evidence and supporting testimony.

Most importantly, it was obvious that the jury of
student peers took their responsibility with the ap-
propriate seriousness; their questions were often
tougher than those posed by the student attorneys
during cross-examination.

Both eyewitnesses to the cheating attended the
hearing with great reservation and at a substantial in-
convenience. Yet both came long distances on rather
short notice to spend their Saturday at W&L. They
both expressed a strong sense of duty to their role in
upholding the honor system; they attended to “‘see
justice done,”’ as one of the eyewitnesses so aptly put
it.

The hearing had a certain dignity to it, if one can
say that of a proceeding for an honor offense with ex-
pulsion the penalty.

The hearing was of some significance because the
controversial polygraph machine was also on trial.
The defense, which apparently invested heavily in the
machine’s results, was allowed to admit the lie detec-
tor test as evidence for the first time in a W&L honor
hearing, to our knowledge.

It is doubtful if the hearing erased any misgivings
about the accuracy of polygraphs as admissible
evidence. But is is imp important to note that the stu-
dent jury was apparently unswayed by the test
results, judging from the conviction handed down
which conflicted with those results.

A major drawback in the hearing was the con-
spicuous lack of students attending to watch their
honor system at work. Part of the problem was the
scheduling of the trial—few students were sufficiently
interested in spending most of an otherwise very plea-
sant Saturday inside Lee Chapel. More importantly,
however, many interested students never got the
word because notice of the hearing was posted less
than 48 hours before the proceeding began.

We should reiterate here our impression that the
hearing was fairly administered and justice was
rendered. But we must end this analysis with some
questions.

In the past six months there have been two appeals
of honor convictions to the student body—more ap-
peals than in the preceding five years. A finding of
guilty in an open hearing is no longer recorded on the
student’s transcript. Does this mean that we may see
more honor offense convictions appealed to the stu-
dent body in the future simply because the accused
has nothing more to lose? And if so, is this necessarily
bad for W&L’s honor system?

Letters To The Editor

Report Security Problems To EC

Dear Editor:

It has come to the attention of
the Executive Committee that
there may be a need for improv-
ed campus security. In order to
determine whether there is in-
deed a need the Executive Com-
mittee has appointed a subcom-

mittee to investigate the mat-
ter.

I feel that I can speak for the
E.C. in stating that we are un-
willing to assume that there is a
new or expanded problem with
vandalism or _ violence.
However, the role of the E.C. is

not to sit back and cope with
problems only when they reach
crisis proportion.

‘The members of the Campus
Security Subcommittee are
Nelson Ould, Bruce Poole and
John Fraser. Any member of
the student body, or any person
associated with the University
should feel welcome to address
comments to these people. Writ-
ten comments can be sent to the
Executive Committee offices in
the University Center. The com-
ments will be particularly
useful if they are received
before November 9.

The subcommittee will also
try to schedule opportunities for
students, faculty, staff and
others to comment at open
meetings scheduled during the
next two weeks. Interested per-
sons should watch the campus
bulletin boards for an-
nouncements of the time and
place of these meetings.

The subcommittee requests
that all comments, written or
oral, include a suggestion as to
how problems can_ be
alleviated. We hope that the
result of all this will be an im-
proved University.

The Advantages Of A Gut

 

A lot of people have pointed out to me that I
am developing a gut. Despite many long
hours of viewing sports on the tube, my flesh
seems to be continuously expanding over my
once quite comfortable pants.

Even my practice of religiously doing a few
12 oz. curls everyday seems to be of no avail.
But as I look toward the ground in search of
my feet I have to ask myself, ‘‘so what?”’

Even though the physical-fitness freaks
might disagree, being portly has some ad-
vantages. With the coming of winter, my ex-
tra layer of skin can help keep me warm and
thus conserve energy, in accordance with the

Graffiti

Dear Editor ;

As a vistor to W&L recently, I
was encouraged at the many
positive changes that have oc-
curred since I graduated.

I believe the renovations and
new construction will allow the

President’s energy guidelines.

Portly people also get invited to a lot of par-
ties because: a.) people automatically
assume that you are funny, and b.) your cor-
pulence makes them feel better in com-
parison.

You even get to find out if girls like you for
yourself. For if we must be reminded that
beauty is only skin deep, only those who really
care will take the effort to go through those
extra layers of flesh.

Now, some people might say that I’m just
rationalizing, that no one could really enjoy
having a spare tire at such an early age. But I
say to them that by not worrying about such a
trivial matter as girth, I am more capable of
considering truly substantive and weighty
matters.

students to learn and study in
an atmosphere that I have
found unparalleled in any other
institution in Virginia.

The new library is especially
nice, as I had occasion to study
this past week. I was, however,
discouraged to see the graffiti,
in the bathrooms on every floor,
carved into the new wood doors,
and inked on the marble and
masonry.

These buildings belong to all
of us — students, faculty, and
alumni. Your tuition gives you
the privilege of learning here,

‘In Response:

Ed Falkowski

Nuclear Power: Not Morally Acceptable

I take issue with the premises upon which
Earnest B. Ferguson bases his ‘‘reform-the-
industry’’ pro-nuclear opinion. (Ring-tum
Phi, ‘‘In Focus,”’ Oct. 18)

‘Without nuclear power we cannot do,” Mr.
Ferguson says. But authorities (including
those in the Department of Energy) agree
that 45 percent of U.S. energy is sheer waste.
This has nothing to to do with our allegedly
‘materialistic,’ life-style. The 45 percent
waste is simply a measure of the inefficiency
with which we use energy to satisfy our life-
style.

 

Mr. Falkowski is a first year law student at
Washington and Lee.

 

Efficiency alone would allow us to double
our effective energy supply. In several
Western Eupean countries our standard of
living is achieved with about half the per
capita consumption of energy.

As John Gofman (Professor Emeritus of
Medical Physics, the University of California
at Berkley—co-discoverer of Uranium 233)
points out, the choice is not between ‘‘clean
nukes” and ‘‘dirty coal,’’ but is rather “‘filthy
nukes” vs. “‘clean nuclear efficiency’’ (with
clean solar power coming along well in spite
of pitifully feeble government support). Gof-
man, ‘‘Nuclear Power: The Need For a Fog
Cutter,” National Forum, Fall, 1979.

By the statement, ‘‘without such reforms
we cannot continue to have nuclear power,”
Mr. Ferguson is implying that nuclear power
can be made acceptable. That is false.

Nuclear power cannot exist without routine
emissions of radioactivity. This is fully

recognized by the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission and the nuclear industry. The NRC
published a table estimating the number of
cancer deaths between 1975 and 2000 caused
by the use of nuclear power in the USS.
Assuming all goes well, there would be 1,100
deaths (26 in foreign countries ).

Direct evidence shows that the NRC has
underestimated this factor by a very large
margin. Studies by Ernest J. Sternglass,
Director of Radiological Physics, University
of Pittsburg, have correlated in a number of
instances the introduction of a nuclear reac-
tor in an area, with a sharp increase in cancer
death rates (these do not involve dramatic
“lapses” for which Mr. Ferguson would
punish violators.

As Dr. Sternglass testified in the trial of a
Federal court case (Honicker v. Hendrie, 465
F. Supp. 414 (M.D. Tenn., 1979)):

‘“‘We rely solely upon a comparison between
a city which has suddenly had nuclear power
operating in it...and suddenly, for no other ex-
plainable reason that has yet been advanced
by anyone in the industry or the Atomic
Energy Commission or the NRC, there was a
sudden and unexplainable rise in infant
deaths, in leukemia, and many years later in
various types of cancers.”’

(Testimony detailing some of these studies is
reprinted in Shutdown: Nuclear Power on
Trial, The Book Publishing Company, Sum-
mertown, TN. (1979).)

The use of nuclear energy will create vast
amounts of highly radioactive wastes. A re-
cent report by the U.8. General Accounting
Office criticized the Department of Energy

and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for

“understating the problems that exist with pro-

posals for waste disposal, and for claiming
the problems can be solved (GAO Report
“Major Unresolved Issues Preventing a
Timely Resolution to Radioactive Waste
Disposal,” July 13, 1978).

“Nuclear power cannot
exist without routine
emissions of radioactivity.
This is fully recognized by
the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission...”

 

After thirty years and millions of dollars
spent on research, the federal government
has not yet developed and adequately tested a
safe, permanent means of storing radioactive
wastes.

These wastes will remain dangerous for
hundreds of centuries. To submit future
generations to the risk of a breach of contain-
ment, for the sake of a few decades of electric
power, is an act of irresponsibility that is un-
precedented in human history.

Thus, Mr. Ferguson is skirting the real
issues when he calls for a “rolling of heads
among those responsible for lapses.’’ Lapses
or no, nuclear power is not a morally accep-
table alternative.

respondence sent to our office. Letters to the

someone is convicted of an honor violation, he is im-

this. I can imagine the delight that I would feel if I
was gotten out of bed at 2:00 a.m. to hear the results of
a J-Board case.

The final instance that hit home with me at the con-

Hampden-Sydney College. He allowed pressure from
