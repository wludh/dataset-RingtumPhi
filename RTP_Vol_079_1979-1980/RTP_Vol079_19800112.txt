What Really Happened
To The W&L 10?

by Randy Smith

Saturday, Dec. 8

Four members of Washington
and Lee’s varsity basketball
team are suspended by Coach
Verne Canfield for their role in
the damage to 37 of the school’s
English boxwood bushes.

Team captain Pete Farrell
and the Generals’ leading
scorer, Carby Hoy, are
suspended for ‘‘disciplinary
reasons” along with teammates
Rob McDevitt and Chris

Schrauth. The four sat in the
crowd for the game that night
graduated from the University
in 1962.

state-wide publicity.

That night, the Student Con-
trol Committee, an all-student
disciplinary body which has the
power to impose penalties and
can recommend expulsion,
meets for what will be a six-
hour session to hear the case of
the 10 W&L students involved in
the boxwood damage.

Also involved, they admit to
the committee, are Brad Lewis,
the basketball team’s manager,
Brian Murphy, a junior varsity
basketball player, Chris Cahill,
a member of the lacrosse team,
Ken Manganiello, a football
player, Tracy Hodge, an assis-
tant to the j.v. basketball team,
and Dave Leunig, an assistant
to the varsity team.

students were also involved in
the damage but were beyond
SCC’s jurisdiction. )

they are all equally guilty, they
say.

Basketball Season In Doubt

This Week

Players Fail In

Reinstatement Bid

University President Robert
E.R. Huntley has formally and
officially ruled out all
possibilities that any of the
students involved in damage to
37 of Washington and Lee’s
English boxwoods will be allow-
ed to participate on W&L
athletic teams this year.

(The University Athletic
Committee, in a meeting before
Christmas break, recommend-
ed to the president that all 10
W&L students involved in the
damage to the boxwoods not be
permitted to represent the
university in intercollegiate
athletic contests for one year.
President Huntley adopted the
committee’s recommenda-
tions. y

Varsity basketball team cap-
tain Pete Farrell and teammate
Carby Hoy went before the
Athletic Committee Tuesday
reportedly to see if they could
be reinstated on the team.

The committee reaffirmed its
earlier decision of suspension
Tuesday, a ruling that applies
regardless of the exact extent of
any individual student’s in-
volvement in the incident.

President Huntley backed the
Athletic Committee’s latest
decision on the case: “I agree
also that the athletic suspension
for the remainder of this
academic year should not be
lifted as to any student who was

involved in the incident.”’

The committee apparently
left the door open for an appeal
of the suspensions later this
year, possibly in April.

The meeting Tuesday be-
tween Farrell and Hoy and the
Athletic Committee is the latest
in a series of actions taken by
several of the students and their
families in an attempt to appeal
the suspensions and get the
students back on the team.

’ A number of parents had con-
versations with administration
officials over the vacation.

The original punishments
handed out by the Student Con-
trol Committee Dec. 10 found all
10 W&L students involved in the
incident to be equally guilty in
damaging the boxwoods. The
SCC is the only committee to
have reviewed all the facts and
evidence in the case.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee “uncritically’’ accepted
the SCC’s findings and recom-
mended adding thé one-year
suspensions to the list of
punishments for the students in-

volved.

One of the students involved
in the incident, Chris Cahill, has
taken a leave of absence from
the university.

Several of the other students
are said to be considering tak-
ing a leave of absence or
transferring to another school.

 

 

The Team’s Future

by Bill Whalen

The bulletin board outside of
W&L Basketball Coach Verne
Canfield’s office seems to best
reflect what has happened to his
squad in the past month. Gone
are the individual pictures of
his players and the plans for the
team’s ill-fated trip to Europe.
Tacked up in their place is a
simple piece of paper bearing a
message:

Life is 100 percent what
happens to you and 90 percent
how you react to what happens to
you. Positive thinking people
never quit or compromise. They
simply adjust and find a way.

This philosophy, undoubtedly
posted and probably written by

Canfield himself, is the
guideline for the rest of the
Generals’ season. With the loss
of four players, including both

starting guards, W&L will now
face the hardest part of its
schedule with what is basically
a makeshift team.

The four players who are off
the team, Captain Pete Farrell,
Carby Hoy, Chris Schrauth, and
Rob McDevitt, have left a huge
void in the squad’s backcourt
depth, as all of the players in-
volved were guards. Moreover,
Hoy and Farrell were the
Generals’ first and_ third

Concert Pianist To Perform Tuesday

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Concert Guild will present
its third program of the season
next Tuesday (Jan. 15) at8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel, with a_per-
formance by contemporary
pianist Joshua Pierce.

His W&L performance will in-
clude a _ broad variety of
musical styles and figures —
from Mozart and Beethoven
through Chopin and Liszt, ¢on-
cluding with pieces by Gott-
schalk and Persichetti.

A graduate of the Manhattan
School of Music, Pierce has per-
formed new compositions by

Josef Alexander, Giampaolo
Bracali, Doris Hays, and W&L
music professor Robert
Stewart.

Also a student of the well-
known music director Dorothy
Taubman, Pierce has assisted

her for the past three summers
as artist-in residence and facul-
ty member at the Taubman
School in Amherst, Mass. and
Rensselaerville, N.Y.

The artist’s touring career
dates from 1976, when he com-
pleted a highly successful visit
to southern Spain in solo and
chamber music recitals with
the American Festival Or-
chestra, part of cultural
festivities honoring America’s
bicentennial celebrations. Most
recently, Pierce performed in a
concert for Mrs. Joan Mondale,
wife of the Vice President and a
contemporary music enthusiast
in her own right.

A recording by Pierce of John
Cage’s ‘‘Sonatas and Interludes
for Prepared Piano’ was
nominated for a Grammy
Award in 1977 as best classical-

contemporary album. This
record, as well as a second,
received the highest rating
from the prestigious Downbeat
Magazine. Still to be released
on Serenus Records are works
by Josef Alexander in col-
laboration with soprano
Rosalyn Reese and the Paul
Price Percussion Ensemble.

Though the concert is free for
members of the W&L communi-
ty, admission is $3 for the
general public. Tickets will be
available at Lee Chapel on the
evening of the performance.

As the Concert Guild’s first
winter-term performer, Pierce
is the initial attraction in a busy
season. He will be followed by
two popular groups — the
Clarion Wind Quintet on Feb. 10
and the Annapolis Brass
Quintet on March 5.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Boxwood Incident

There can be no doubt that the so-called boxwood in-
cident was a disgrace and embarrassment to the var-
sity basketball team, to Washington and Lee’s
athletic program, and to the university as a whole.
The destructive acts of 10 W&L students and their
four Longwood College companions can never be con-
doned or justified.

We will not, however, cast judgment on the in-
dividuals involved. It seems unreasonable to us to
castigate and recommend punishment when all of the
facts about the incident are not available for our ex-
amination. (How, then, can we make an informed
judgment? )

We find it astonishing that so many members of the
W&L community jumped to impulsive, emotional and
uninformed judgments. As soon as the Student Con-
trol Committee’s punishments of the 10 students in-
volved became known, there was an outpouring of
grumbling throughout the campus that the penalties
weren't “‘harsh enough” and amounted to merely ‘‘a
Slap on the wrist.’’ All of this second-guessing was
done by those who had not attended the marathon six-
hour SCC session and, therefore, did not have access
to the evidence and circumstances upon which Stu-
dent Control had based its decision. And the SCC judg-
ment was reportedly a unanimous one.

Again, we cannot and will not condone the destruc-
tive acts of these 14 individuals. But it is also wrong
for those without access to all the facts to cast judg-
ment and recommend alternate penalties.

What we really lack is information. Although we
have done our best to fill in the gaps about what hap-
pened during a series of closed meetings on the box-
wood incident, our information is still sketchy and in-
complete. Rumors provided the only information
many people had—and the rumors proved to be
predictably unreliable.

One possible solution is to allow press access to im-
portant disciplinary hearings in which the university
community clearly has an interest—the boxwood inci-
dent would fall into such a category. This incident
demonstrates the dangers inherent when a society
lacks the vital information it needs to formulate in-
formed judgments. We recommend that in the future
a member of the campus press be granted access to
what have traditionally been closed hearings so that
the information needed by the community can be
disseminated.

We were shocked by the reactions of some, by the
bitter contempt several members of the W&L
community—faculty and students alike—expressed
toward the 10 students involved and toward Student
Control and what was preceived to be a lenient form
of punishment. Some of this hostile reaction might
possibly have been alleviated somewhat if the facts
had been available for the community to inspect. We
all have a right to know in what manner and why a
certain disciplinary action was taken in an incident
which has such a profound affect upon our entire com-
munity. *

The Ring-tum Phi views its role as a responsibility
to convey as much information as possible to the W&L
community about matters which directly affect it. We
will continue to disseminate information, when possi-
ble, and serve as a forum for the responsible views of
members of the W&L community.

Again, we feel duty-bound to warn against hastily
conceived judgments based only upon incomplete in-

formation.

 

 

Generals

Need Us

Dear Students,

As we all return to Lexington
to begin a new term and a new
decade, I would like to wish
everyone a happy New Year
and hopes that the holidays
were joyous for all.

I am sure that you are all
aware of the unforeseen prob-
lems and pressures which have
befallen the Basketball
Generals.

The team entered this season
with high hopes for an ODAC
Championship. Three of the five
original starting players re-
main on the team, and a strong
bench is now filling the
vacanies created by the un-
fortunate incident involving the
boxwoods.

However, no matter how
much talent this team
possesses, it cannot regain its
confidence and pride without
support. The Generals need us,
the STUDENT BODY, to show
them that we care and that w
are behind them.

Defense Reporter

To Speak On Monday

Charles Corddry, defense and
foreign policy reporter for the
Baltimore Sun and panelist on
the television series
‘‘Washington Week in Review,”
will speak at Washington and
Lee University next Monday
(Jan. 14) as part of a week-long
visit to the campus sponsored
by the Woodrow Wilson Visiting
Fellowship.

Team’s Future In Doubt

(continued from page 1)
leading scorers, respectively.

Before and after the boxwood
incident, W&L has played like
two entirely different teams.
Before the loss of the four
players, the Generals had a
record of three wins and two
losses and were outscoring their
opponents by an average of
eight points in each of their vic-
tories. In the last three games,
however, the Generals are 1-2,
including two losses at the Sun-
coast Classic in St. Petersburg,
Florida.

But the worse seems yet to
come. In a nine-day period, the
Generals will play five games.
The first two gdmes are at

home in the Washington and ~
Lee Tournament this weekend. ~

Then come the three most im-
portant games of the year.

The first of these three en-
counters is a rematch with
Hampden-Sydney on the Tigers’
home court. Two days later, the
Generals must play Eastern
Mennonite, a vastly improved
team, in another away game.

Finally, W&L will be at home
to take on the Lynchburg
Hornets, who at this moment
seem to be the best team in the
ODAC. It will be in these three
games that much of the pair-
ings for the ODAC Tournament
will be decided.

Replacing Farrell and Hoy in
the backcourt are a pair of
sophomores, George Spears
and Clark New. Both Spears
and New saw limited playing
time last year but have been im-
proving with each game. New
has already hit for 21 points in
one game and Spears has had
two 16-point efforts as a starter.

Where the Generals have
been hurt the most is on their
bench. With the movement of
New and Spears to the starting

five, W&L is left with only two
experienced players coming off
the bench—Brian Hanson and
Travis Patterson. However,
Hanson is a center and Patter-
son is a strong forward.

To at least have enough
guards to hold an inter-squad

' practice, Canfield called up Ken

Jaffe and Mark Shaver from the
junior varsity team. Neither
player had seen a minute of ac-
tion with the varsity before this
year.

As an indication of how bad

- things have gone for the

Generals, the team cannot hold
a decent practice when the j.v.
has a game. Of the thirteen
players now on Canfield’s team,
six also suit up for j.v. games.
This leaves only seven players
for Canfield to work with. And
of these seven, Smitherman,
Scaggs and Patterson have
each been hobbled with in-
juries.

Thus, it is apparent that the
outlook for the rest of the
basketball season is anything
but optimistic. All the Generals
can hope for is to find a consis-
tent offense and defense in the
remaining six weeks until the
conference tournament.

And the tournament may be a
blessing in disguise. As is the
case in the ACC and the SEC,
the ODAC uses its season-end
tournament to determine which
team will get an NCAA bid. If
the Generals do not fare too well
in the regular season, they
might possibly be playing their
best basketball by the time of
the tournament. If they are
peaking and if they get a good
seeding, then the Generals
might very well walk away with
a championship.

But until the tournament rolls
around, all the basketball team
can do is wait. Wait and hope.

Scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in the
Northern Auditorium of W&L’s
undergraduate library, Cord-
dry’s lecture is entitled ‘Iran,

Afganistan, Pakistan: There
Goes the Whole’ Neigh-
borhood?”’

The confused state of Mideast
news events is a natural subject
for Corddry, who has nearly 40
years of reporting experience to
his credit. He joined the Sun’s
Washington Bureau in 1967,
after 25 years on the reporting
staff of United Press Interna-
tional. And he has appeared on
‘Washington Week in Review’’.
since that series began more
than 12 years ago.

Corddry specializes’ in
military and foreign affairs and
has reported on NATO for most
of its 30-year history. Other
assignments have taken him
from Berlin, including a visit
when ‘‘the wall”’ was erected, in
1961 to Cape Canaveral for the
early missile and space ac-
tivities.

He was sent to Korea upon the
outbreak of war there in 1950
and returned in 1977 to cover
U.S.-South Korean defense
negotiations during a reporting
trip through the Pacific. He
covered Senate debates over
SALT I and II in 1972 and 1979
and American responses to the
1973 Middle East war.

While at W&L, Corddry will
address selected classes in
history, journalism, politics and
military science. Informal
meetings with professors and
students will continue through
the week.

mitted their guilt for the
destruction and said they knew
they were doing something
wrong.

Members of the group told the
committee that they did not
realize the extent or the cost of
the damage while they were do-
ing it, but that there was no
malicious intent in their ac-
tions.

has not been determined by the
university. )

story before he suspended the
four players prior to the
Shenandoah game.

In his testimony before the
SCC, Canfield emphasized that

Assistant to the President.

Poyner died before the third
installment arrived but left in-
structions in his will to remove
the remaining bushes from the
‘Weeks Estate.”” The bushes,
according to Parsons, were
already numbered and catalog-
ed by University represen-
tatives.

their mistakes and asked that
the SCC not recommend expul-
sion for this ‘‘one mistake.”’ He
offered an alternative: a work
program of some kind; he even
offered to supervise the work.

“No one on the: committee
really wanted to kick them out
and nothing would have been
solved by it,” a participant in
the meeting, who asked not to
be named, told the Ring-tum
Phi.

The SCC places all 10 students
on social probation for the re-
mainder of the school year
(which forbids them to partake
in any fraternity function or to
use some of the university’s
recreational facilities), conduct
probation (a ‘‘severe warning’’
for misconduct) for the re-
mainder of their enrollment at
W&L, and that each must work
eight hours a week in the com-
munity for the remainder of the
school year under the supervi-
sion of the SCC.

The committee also recom-
mends that all ten make ar-
rangements with the university
to pay for the damages. (The
SCC does not have the power to
interfere with athletics. )

After the meeting, Tim
Brooks, chairman of the SCC,
told the Ring-tum Phi his com-
mittee ‘feels that this punish-
ment is one which is not merely
punitive but constructive. After
lengthy deliberations, the com-
mittee decided that of those

Parsons. The six heirs to the
‘‘Weeks Estate”’ disagreed.

The question of ownership
eventually went to court. At one
time the litagation went to a
federal court in Alexandria, Va.
but was returned to the Virginia
state courts. Both sides of the
case, Washington and Lee being

the defendant, settled the case,

‘out of court with the University
agreeing to return 12 boxwoods.

not preclude any legal action by
the university nor any indepen-
dent disciplinary action taken
by the athletic department.”

Student Body President Steve
Abraham said that, ‘‘the’
students shouldn’t be so quick to
prejudge the punishment in this
case without knowing the
facts.”

However, the facts of the case
are known only to those few who
had attended the SCC meeting.

though final exams begin the

Wednesday, Dec. 12

The University Athletic Com-
mittee meets at ‘‘the direction
of’’ University President
Robert E.R. Huntley (who is in
New York) at noon.

In an hour and a half-long
meeting, the committee accepts
“uncritically”’ the findings of
the SCC and votes to recom-
mend to the president that all 10
be suspended for one year from
positions in which they would
represent the university in
athletics.

The vote for suspension is
unanimous and the committee’s
concensus is that the 10 students
involved in the bush destruction
were not given sufficient
punishment by Student Control.

(The Athletic Committee is
an advisory group with no
direct powers. )

The committee did not have
the opportunity to examine any
of the evidence considered by
the SCC.

After he has been informed of
the Athletic Committee’s rul-
ing, President Huntley then
reportedly calls Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry and in-
structs him to implement the
committee’s instructions.

There the matter rests until
Christmas break.
