Freshman Removed From Ballot ;

But Sti

By John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
held a special meeting Sunday
night to discuss a , Voting
Regulations Board recommen-
dation that a freshman can-
didate for the EC be removed
from. Monday’s election
because he _ overspent his
budget.

When the meeting ended two
hours later, the eandidate, John
Lowe, had been removed from
the ballot for overspending his
budget, but was allowed to par-
ticipate in the election as a
write-in candidate.

The next day, Lowe received
66 votes from the freshmen
class, finishing second behind
Kraig Armantrout, who had 71
votes, and advancing to today’s
freshman class run-off.

But the hastily called meeting
Sunday night was more com-
plicated that the outcome in-
dicates. The EC went through
five votes with much debate and
some heated words.

   

Jim Wenke, Sam Allen, and Jay Blumberg listen to the discussion

of John Lowe’s status at Sunday’s EC meeting.

Before voting on the VRB
recommendation, the EC asked

Lowe to explain the cir-
cumstances which led to the
overspending charge.

“T Jet the VRB have my ex-
pense list, which was $4.80 for
flyers and $4.80 for a Ring-tum
Phi ad,’’ Lowe said.

Lowe said friends made dona-
tions to pay for a party, which
the candidate advertised on his

 

W&L Tenure Series

 

by Joe Scott

Of the 14 full time employees
in the Physical Education
department, 11 have tenure.

The same tenure process is
used in the P.E. department as
in other parts of the University.
Those promoted to associate
professor or those who have
taught full time for seven years
are eligible.

First there is a meeting of all
tenured professors in the
department to discuss the
merits of the teacher being con-
siderad, then a vote by secret
ballot. A unanimous vote will
mean a positive recommenda-
tion written by Athletic Direc-
tor William McHenry. If there
are dissenting votes then
McHenry makes a recommen-
dation on how he feels.

The recommendation is then
submitted to the Dean of the
College, William Watt, and then
to the university’s tenure com-
mittee. Ultimately the decision

 

The P.E. Department

will be made by the Board of
Trustees.

Currently there is no one be-
ing considered for tenure in the
P.E. department.

Average salaries for the
1978-1979 positions at
Washington and Lee are $30,110
for professers, $23,488 for
associate professors, assistants
make $18,883 and instructors
take home $15,427. All figures
include fringe benefits.

Professors McHenry,
Richard Miller; associate prof.
Verne Canfield and assistant
prof. Jack Emmer share the ad-
ministration duties and titles.

In addition, Associate Direc-
tor of Athletics Miller coaches
cross country and teaches a
class, P.E. 300 in Physical
Education and Health. Canfield
coaches basketball and also
oversees the intramural pro-
gram, and Emmer coaches

flyer, and to pay for extra
posters.

The flyer had endorsements
for Lowe’s candidacy.

Lowe said he helped plan the
party and put up the additional
posters with his tape, but added
that he did not pay for the addi-
tional campaign expenses.

EC President Steve Abraham
asked Lowe if he recommended
his friends make donations.

IFC Positions
Decided

Brian Gibson of Chi Psi was
elected Secretary of the Inter-
fraternity Council and Jamie
Hall of Lamda Chi won the
Treasurer position at the IFC
meeting Tuesday night.

John Snedden of Phi Delta

~ Theta was elected to the Senior

Justice position.

The two Junior Justice posi-
tions were won by Scott Dacus
of Kappa Sigma and Mark
McGlaughlin of Phi Gamma
Delta.

Alan Pyror of Pi Kappa Phi
won the Rush Chairman posi-
tion and Don Rigger of Delta
Tau Delta took the Social Chair-
man position.

Kevin Dwyer of Sigma Phi
Epsilon will be the Rush Book
Editor.

In other IFC business, frater-
nity house members were
reminded that checklists for
house inspection are due March
31 with spot inspections

See IFC, page 12

Lowe said he did not, tnat his
supporters asked if they could
help his campaign by throwing
a party.

He also told the EC that there
is no mention of donations in the
VRB rules.

The efficacy and clarity of the
VRB rules governing elections
caused a split in the EC debate.

Members of the EC who later
supported Lowe’s withdrawal
said the rules were clear
because of the rule’s spirit,

while EC members who voted to .

let Lowe remain in the election
said the rules are nebulous on
the point of contributions.

‘‘What do you think is the pur-
pose of the VRB rules?”
Abraham asked Lowe.

“So people will not go wild
with spending,”’ replied Lowe.

Senior Representative Jay
Blumberg asked VRB Chair-

‘man Robert Neely if there was

any room for misinterpretation
of the rules.
Neely said there was room for

Advances Into Runoff

misinterpreatation, * ‘in a small
way.

Neely defended the VRB rules
saying, ‘We wanted a fair elec-
tion and equitable effort for all
candidates.”’

He added that all candidates
were told to ask him if they had
questions about the rules.

The VRB Chairman said the
VRB’s 4-0 disqualifying recom-
mendation reached by Neely,
George larossi, Jeff Bartlett,
and Edward Gonsalves,
members of the VRB, meant
Lowe would not be allowed to
participate as a write-in can-
didate.

The other member of the
VRB, Toni Carli, could not be
reached in time to vote on the
matter.

But Abraham disagreed with
Neely, “if we struck Lowe’s
name from the ballot, he would
become a write-in candidate.”
And interpretation of the rules
caused a majority of the debate

Trouble In The Pit

by David Greer

After a rash of crowd control
problems at the Cockpit during
concerts the management has
affirmed that it will take
stronger action in the future in
dealing with customers who get
out of hand.

Student manager Mark Gin-
nevan said the Cockpit will en-
force its standing policy of war-
ning students who misbehave,
and that tbose who do not heed
warnings will be subject to ac-
tion by Student Control. If
necessary, police will be called.

During the Nighthawks show
two weekends ago, six students
were removed from the
Cockpit. Four left quietly when
accused of smoking marijuana ;
the other two were forcefully
removed.

Richard ‘‘Dyke’’ Wagner, a
1979 graduate, was found hiding
under a table between shows.
He refused to leave and
wasbodily removed. During the
altercation, according to
witnesses, Wagner attempted to

hit a doorman and the doorman
returned a_ punch,loosening
some of Wagner’s teeth.

Senior Andy Holds was asked
to leave while drinking a beer
between shows. He resisted but
finally complied. Later he ap-
proached Ginnevan and verbal-
ly abused him and grabbed him,
Ginnevan said. He was remov-
ed, the police called, and Holds
was arrested for being drunk in
public.

“Students don’t realize that
even though this is university
property it has to abide by state
laws,”’ Ginnevan said.
Nonetheless; the management
wants to try to handle any pro-
blems through the university.

“Student Control is aware of
the problem; anybody who does
mess up will be brought up
before Student Control,” Gin-
nevan said.

“If someone is found guilty of
causing trouble or of un-

Author Speaks Tonight

John Toland, widely known
historian and author, will speak
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity tonight. His talk,
“The Rising Sun,”’ will focus on
his Pulitzer Prize-winning
history ‘“‘The Rising Sun: The
Decline and Fall of the
Japanese Empire, 1936-1945.”
Toland says ‘‘the speech
describes why I wrote the book,
how I researched it, and what I
found out — and what I’ve
learned since the book’s release
that hasn’t held up.”’

The lecture will take place at

p.m. in the Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library. All interested

members of the public are in-
vited to attend the program,
which is under the joint spon-
sorship of W&L’s Department
of History and the East Asian
Studies Program.

In addition to “The Rising
Sun,”’ Toland is the author of a
number of best-selling
histories, many dealing with
German themes. He first ad-

dressed the subject of Hitler in’

an account called ‘‘The Last 100
Days,’’ which was later made
into a motion picture. This was
followed more recently by the

   

Selling W&L

Stretching Statistical Truth

By Mike Perry

According to a pamphlet writ-
ten by the Washington and Lee
News Office for distribution by
the Admissions Office to pro-
spective students and high
school guidance counselors,
“more than 80 percent of our
freshmen stay until gradua-
tion.” This is an impressive
statistic, but depending upon
how it is interpreted, may or
may not be true.

If one interprets this state-
ment as an indication that
Washington and Lee has a 20
percent attrition rate (the
number of students who enter
as freshmen, but do_ not
graduate from W&L), among
its undergraduates, the state-
ment would seem to be not only
impressive but false.

In fact, the attrition rate here
as W&L has fluctuated over the

EC Postpones Reserve Fund Vote

By John Billmyre
The Executive Committee
decided Monday night during
its regular meeting to postpone

an amendment raising the
balance in the reserve fund
from $2,500 to $4,000.

The amendment will be
brought up next fall, probably
to be voted on as _ students
maticulate.

Originally the amendment
was going to be brought up
when students got their
schedules for next semester.

The amendment failed to pass
during the Big Three elections
because less than 50 percent of
the student body voted.

From now until April 21 the
EC will be accepting White
Book changes. EC Secretary

Cove Geary said the recommen-
dations should be typed.

The EC also voted that third
year law students should not be
allowed to vote in the EC
representative elections Mon-
day.

Candidates for the third year ~

position are:

Jeff Edwards, second year;
Bruce Meyers, first year;
Nathan Smith, first year.

Jamie Small, Chairman of the
University Center Committee,
was on hand to answer EC ques-
tions about ticket scalping.

Several freshmen complained
tickets for theNighthawks con-
cert in the Cockpit were sold for
high prices by individuals.

Director of Admissions
William Hartog admits that the
phrase is ‘‘stated incorrectly.”
because it imphes that 8U per-
cent of W&L’s_ entering
freshmen graduate after four
years and will be clarified in
future publications. Hartog is
quick to add that many students
who leave Washington and Lee
do so with the intention of retur-
ning to graduate and in fact do
so.

New York Sludge

How much sewage does New
York City produce each year?
About 10 million cubic yards, or
enough to fill the Empire State
Building 20 times.

Sewage has become a big pro-
blem for the Big Apple. For
over 50 years they have been
barging the stuff 12 miles out to
sea and dumping it into the
ocean in an area called the New
York Bight.

But last fall, the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency found all
sorts of nasty things in the
water around New York’s har-
bor and told the city they could
no longer use the Atlantic as its
septic tank.

The problem is that the city
has no other place to dump its
waste, which adds up to 8,300
tons every day. And the sludge
has cadmium (which is from
tires) in it, as well as other
dangerous bacteria. Cadmium
is a heavy metal and has been
linked to kidney and _ liver
diseases.

“The land on which sludge
compost is spread may never be
used for any agricultural pur-
pose whatsoever,’’ New York’s
Department of Environmental
Protection grimly concluded.

A fight is developing in Con-
gress on the future disposal of
New York’s sludge. In a stall

Hartog explains that the
desire of more college students
to ‘‘take a year off,” the strain
of inflation and the increasing
cost of a college education are
of reasons why
students leave W&L which are
completely beyond the Univer-
sity’s control. Hartog adds that
80 percent of entering freshmen
eventually graduate with W&L
degrees.

GRE Answers Available

PRINCETON, N.J. — Nearly
40,000 students throughout the
world who took the Graduate
Record Examinations Aptitude
Test on Jan. 12 can now obtaina
copy of the questions used in
that test and a list of the correct
answers.

The Graduate Record Ex-
aminations Board, which spon-
sors the test, released a 40-page
booklet containing the questions
that were counted toward the
actual scores, a list of correct
answers, instructions for ob-
taining “raw” scores and a
table for finding scaled scores
reported for the test. The
booklet also includes a descrip-
tion of the test and explanations
of the kinds of questions asked.

The booklet costs $2 per copy.
For $3.50, examinees can also
obtain a photocopy of their
answer sheet.

The release of test questions
and answer sheets meets the re-
quirements of the New York
State Admissions Testing Law
of 1979, which went into effect
Jan. 1.

The law requires that ques-
tions and correct answers for
any standardized test used in
connection with admission pro-
cedures to colleges and
graduate schools be made
public shortly after the test is
administered to students in
New York State. Students who
take the test in New York State
may also obtain a copy of their
answer sheet.

A booklet containing the ques-

tions and answers used in the
April 26 and April 28 GRE ad-
ministration will be available to
anyone after July 1.

LSDA Delay

Shortened

PRINCETON, N.J.—Law
School applicants are advised
that the eight-week delays in
processing Law School Data
Assembly Service (LSDAS)
reports, caused by the late
delivery of a new computer
system, have been reduced to
two weeks — the level ex-
perienced in the past at this
time of year. ;

Because earlier delays slow-
ed the decision process in some
law schools, the Law School Ad-
mission Council, sponsor of the
LSDAS, has recommended that
the earliest deposit deadline
date of law schools be extended
from April 1, 1980, to May 1,
1980. Individual law schools,
however, determine their own
deadline dates.

As an additional measure, the
LSDAS has also asked law
schools to verify that each
school has all the information
from the LSDAS necessary to
complete its admission deci-
sions for the year.

Students who are faced with
specific problems involving
LSDAS reports are asked to
write to Law Programs,

Edgar W. Spencer, head of
the geology department at

grant from the Petroleum
Research Fund of the American
Chemical Scciety to support his
geological research in the Blue
Ridge area.

The grant will enable Spencer
to carry out research primarily
during the coming two sum-
mers. His goal is to construct
‘“‘detailed geological cross-
sections showing the mineral
composition in the region’”’ he
said — data that will be ‘“‘of
great use” in petroleum ex-
ploration.

Oil firms have begun to show
an interest in western Virginia,
purchasing mineral rights at $1
to $5 an acre on speculation.

Theatre through March 29th, Tickets may be reserved by calling 463-9111, ext. 371.

Lively ‘Pippin’ at Troubadour

By Paul Hendry

Playing at the Troubadour
Theatre till Saturday, March 29
is PIPPIN — the play made
famous by Bob Fosse on the
Broadway stage. The intimate
and electric theatre experience
awaiting all members of the
W&L community each season at
the ‘‘Troub”’ is too often passed
over by far too many students.
This week everyone has the op-
portunity to see the W&L
University Theatre in an am-
bitious and lively performance
of a rather unique, and at times
bizarre, ‘‘musical comedy.”’

Pippin, the son of
Charlemagne, is a young col-
lege grad (out of Padua in
Medieval days) loose in the big
wide world on his own for the
first time, and he has his heart
set on finding ‘‘it’’ — the fulfill-
ment of life. His various en-
counters and disappointments
stretch the plot to its
philosophic conclusions.

The Opening is one of the
strongest and most polished
scenes, an exotic and erie mo-
ment that is slickly directed,
and it serves as a fine introduc-
tion to the dream-like world of
the theatre that the play con-
sciously depicts. The hypnotic
power and excitement of the il-
lusion of the stage is well em-
bodied from the outset.

The lighting is used for
tremendous effects throughout

the show, especially in the
Opening and the “‘orgy”’ scene.
The play is easily racey enough
to keep any all-male population
entertained. The music, which
is faciliar to many, is
memorable and engaging from
the start.

The audience immediately
meets the intrusive Leading
Player, who is performed with
distinction by David Sorrells.
His enthusiasm generates
brightly on stage, and his lively
singing and dancing are the
highlight of the show. The
character serves as moderator
of the action as well as com-
mentator.

Art Dunnam is equally

likeable in the title role. His -

Pippin is properly confused yet
strangely self assured in the
whirlwind of encounters he
undergoes. Both Sorrells and
Dunnam maintain a relaxed
closeness with the audience that
is essential in such a small
theatre.

Richard Boaz’s Charlemagne
proves to be one of the crowd’s
favorites, as do the characters
played by Ginger McNeese,
Robert Shuman, Rose Gordon
and Penni Westbrook. The rest
of The Players do admirably,
playing multiple roles and ad-
ding many of the audience’s
favorite comic touches.

What makes PIPPIN most
enjoyable is its music and the

effervescent quality of its grand
production numbers. Sorrells’s
Leading Player makes keen
enough spectacle alone in the
Opening or when teamed up
with Pippin in a number like
“Right Track.”

Some of the most memorable
and amusing moments are the
larger scenes that involve most
all of the Band of Players. ‘‘War
is a Science’ and any one of a
number of moments from Pip-
pin’s pastoral interlude in
which he encounters the
pleasures of the flesh and a
secularized existence stand out
for their sheer ability to please
the audience.

The Finale is as powerful as
the opening, only instead of ask-
ing ‘‘what am I seeing?”’ the au-
dience is forced to examine the
question “what have I seen?”’
The ending is very dramatic
and philosophic, and the —_-use
of the rear screen projection of
Medieval art works is both
creative and effective within
the simplistic set that allows the
imagination to roam more free-
ly.

The choreography and music
combine for entertainment that
keeps the audience happily in-
volved, especially in the larger
production numbers. Warning:
PIPPIN is more than a stan-
dard musical comedy. It is an
out of the ordinary theatre ex-
perience well worth enjoying.

Film Notes————

Young Frankenstein (1974)—Mel Brooks’ talent has never been
as evident as in this send-up of horror movies, full of excellent ver-
bal and slapstick humor. It is a visual tribute to the 1940’s film mak-
ing it satirizes; the softly-lit black and white settings in Tran-
sylvania evoke a dormant genre. The familiar surroundings make
sharper the parody of the ancient monster story, and Brooks
couldn’t have directed a funnier cast: Gene Wilder as the young Dr.
Frankenstein (pronounced “Fronkin-steen) ; Madeline Kahn as his
obnoxious fiancee; Peter Boyle as the monster; and the incredible
Marty Feldman as Eyegore. They are assisted in their efforts by
Teri Garr and Cloris Leachman as the equine hag Frau Bluche.
Gene Hackman does a cameo in perhaps the film’s funniest se-
quence as a blind old peasant serving the monster soup. Brooks and

Wilder wrote the script. Presented by the SAB Friday through Sun-\-
day, March 28th-30th in Dupont Auditorium at 7 and 9 p.m. Admis-
sion is $1.

Bread and Chocolate (1978)—Highly reputable comedy by the
Italian director Franco Brusati. A discussion of which appears in
this issue of the Ring-tum Phi. Friday and Saturday at 8:00 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall. Admission is free.

Hester Street (1975)—Joan Micklin Silver directed this
meticulous, thoughtful account of the travails of Jewish im-
migrants in Manhatten’s lower east side in the late 1890’s. The
highly competent cast includes Steven Keats, Doris Roberts, and
Carol Kane, who received an Academy Award nomination for her
performance. To be shown in Reid 203, Tuesday April 1st, at 7 and 9
p.m. Admission is.free.

Film Society Presents ‘Bread and Chocolate’

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present as_ its
seventh film of the 1979-80
season Franco’ Brusati’s
brilliantly skeptical and pro-
found comedy Bread and
Chocolate (Italy, 1978). Show-
ings are scheduled for Friday
and Saturday, March 28 and 29,
at 8 P.M. in classroom ‘‘A”’ of
Lewis Hall, free of charge.

Bread and Chocolate won the
New York Film Critics Award
as the year’s Best Foreign
Film. Brusati, with Ermanno
Olmi (The Tree of the Wooden
Clogs), is one of the Italian
directors whose work has
recently become highly visible

in this country.

The movie centers around the

mishaps of an Italian migrant
worker who is trying to earn in
Switzerland the meager living
he cannot make in his own coun-
try. The comedy arises from the
clash of national tempera-
ments, Italian warm-
heartedness and sweaty sen-
timentality against Swiss
refinement and neatness. The
hero is a swarthy misfit in a
world of prospering and
fastidious blondes.

‘Ethnic identities are
developed in a series of brilliant
scenes: the hero urinating on a
Swiss park wall, a crime for
which he is to be deported,

while the apprehension of a
Swiss child murderer causes
barely a ripple because his
crimes don’t violate the park’s
beauty or the sense of public
propriety; the hero dyeing his
hair blonde in an effort to fit in-
to Swiss society by denying

even to himself his Italian iden-

tity; and the widely praised
Rhine Maidens scene in which
the hero watches through the
windows of his chicken-coop-
home, the blond, elegant
children of the wealthly bathe
naked in a nearby stream.

The movie’s refusal to
simplify the appeal and the
liabilities of either national
temperament raises the treat-

Music Review

‘Cretones,’ ‘Urban Verbs,’ etc.

By Mark Kinniburgh

The new music piles up so quickly at the beginn-
ing of a'year and it gets difficult to sort out the gar-
bage from the worthwhile releases. Maybe a quick
look at a few very new and not-so-new artists and
the products of their latest efforts.

Cheers to The Cretones, from California, for
their latest release at the hands of Ronstadt’s good
friend, Mark Goldenburg. The most powerful ver-
sion of ‘‘Mad Love’ can be found on the Cretones
album, along with two other songs which made it
on Linda Ronstadt’s ‘‘Mad Love’ LP. The
Cretones have retained all the rock ’n roll that was
forgotten on ‘‘Mad Love,”’ A good 2.7 ona 4.0 scale.

Also cheers to go The Urban Verbs a new wave
band from Washington, D.C. featuring the brother
of Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz, Roddy.
Lyrically, the Verbs are a mixture of the B-52’s
and Tom Waits, both bizarre and very meaningful.
Musically, the Verbs provide a foil for Roddy
Frantz by blending synthesizer, guitar, and heavy
percussion into a very listenable collage. 2.5 on a
4.0scale.

“Best of the Week”’ award goes to The Motors an
English rock duo famous until now only through
imports and very select distribution by their
parent record company, Virgin Records.

At first listen, the music sounds like Blondie
with a male vocalist, but given a little time, The
Motors prove that Blondie lyrics are third grade
compared to the Motors skillfully poetic construc-
tions. This album will be big on radio by the sum-
mer, and a single is being released this spring for
national distribution. 3.25 ona 4.0 scale,

‘Keep your wallet in your pocket” award this

week goes to Ron Goedert probably the ugliest
man (or whatever) to ever wear stretch pants, (in
pink no less). Goedert attempts to sound like Van
Halen, but comes out to a big idiot that would lose
a junior high school talent contest. The worst joke
about the album is the blatant idiotic appeal of the
songs, all of which approximate, ‘‘hey there high
school baby, hop in my truck, let’s drink some
beer, and then we’ll ahhhh!!. Rate it a 0.7 on a 4.0
scale.

Another waste of vinyl this week is the Currie
Sisters debut album entitled ‘‘Messin with the
Boys,”’ The only thing the Currie Sisters have go-
ing for them is their looks, but even that can’t
make up for their severe talent deficiency. These
so-called vocalists are backed up by the Acme of
Los Angeles studio musicians, and thinking about
it, those musicians must be extremely embarrass-
ed to have done such a rotten record. I guess they
got paid. Rate it a 1.0 on a plus 4.0 scale (for their
looks. )

Notes: New Dead album due in mid-April... The
African jazz band in the Dining Hall this Friday
will really impress you — good stuff...Van Halen
will release “‘Women and Children First’’ any day
now...

Robert Fripp’s latest is going to be amazing and
called “Under Heavy Manners/God Save the
Queen”’ it features live tracks from last year’s
tours... Jeff Lorber Fusion is working on a new
record that is slated for release in early April...If
anyone knows where Bruce Springsteen’s new
album is, please call him in Asbury Park. He lost
it last December and hasn’t been able to find it
since. Listen to WLUR-FM.

ment above simple cliche,
although in the case of
Switzerland, in particular, the
treatment ‘is so shrewdly
caustic that it is a wonder the
Swiss government hasn’t sued.
Because of the way in which
ethnic value are balanced, the
hero finally becomes a man
without a country emotionally
as well as politically.

The Film Society will show

ing Rock (Australia, 1977),

Generals Now Ranked Fourth In Nation

Washington & Lee’s 13-10 win
over North Carolina State,

coupled with upset defeats of.

Maryland and Navy, vaulted
the Generals into fourth place in
this week’s lacrosse poll.

The Generals, who had been
ranked sixth in the previous
week’s ratings, also won their
third straight game last Mon-
day afternoon, routing the Air
Force Academy on Wilson field,
20-6.

On Saturday, while the
Generals were collecting win
their victory over the Wolfpack.
both Maryland and Navy were
upset on their home fields.
Maryland was edged by
Rutgers, 9-8, while Navy was
defeated by Syracuse, 11-8.

In this week’s poll, Johns
Hopkins remained the toprated
team, while North Carolina,
ranked fourth in the previous
week, moved into the second
spot. Rutgers moved up to the
third spot, as opposed to its No.
8 ranking the week before.

Meanwhile, the Generals
moved into the No. 4 spot, ten
points ahead of Mayland.
Following Maryland are: Cor-
nell, Syracuse, Virginia, Navy,
Army, Massachusetts, Hofstra,
Towson State, Brown and North
Carolina State.

Though the scores of the N.C.
State and Air Force games dif-
fer, a similar pattern can be
seen. In both games, the
Generals got off to quick leads
in the first few minutes of the
first and second quarters.

Against N.C. State, the
Generals relied on a strong first
half and then held off a
Wolfpack rally in the closing
minutes. Leading the Generals
was attackman Chris Kearney,
who had his usual three goals.

But the Cannon Award for
player of the game went to mid-
fie, midfielder Geoof Brerit. The

 

   

lanky middie provided strong
ball-handling all afternoon as
he was one of the quarterbacks
of the Generals’ swing offense.

Behind the scoring of
Kearney and the strong defense
of Bob Clements, Jim Herbert
and Steve Johnson, the
Generals rolled to an imposing
10-3 halftime lead. Senoir Jay
Foster scoring in the opening
seconds of the game, indicating
it would be a_ high-scoring
game.

But if the first half belonged
to the Generals. then the second
half was a little too close for
comfort. N.C. State was able to
pull within two goals at 10-8, but
the Genrals defense did an ex-
cellent job clearing the ball in
the closing moments.

The victory did have one

limited action in the second
half. Staugaitis did not even suit
up for Monday’s contest.

And against Air Force,
Staugaitis was really not need-
ed. The Generals ended any
doubt as to the outcome in the
first six minutes of the first
quarter, scoring six goals to
take a 6-0 lead.

It would have been more than
merciful to have ended the
game at that point.

Some Sports Thoughts Between

By Bill Whalen

Here we are in the middle of
sports seasons. The NCAA has
concluded its longest basketball
season ever, the NBA is about to
begin its three-month odyssey
called playoffs and baseball is
or is not around the corner.

Here are some thoughts I’ve
compiled over the past few
weeks:

—Isn’t it impressive that the
W&L baseball team is at .500 so
far this year. Trivia question:
when did a W&L baseball squad
last finish at .500 or better?

—The Boston Celtics may
have the first pick in this year’s
NBA draft. Will the Celts take
the best bag man in the country,
Joe Barry Carroll, or will they

announce that they have signed
Ralph Sampson? Will they do
the unlikely and select Dr.
Dunkenstein, a.k.a. Darrell
Griffith, or will they pick a
sleeper like Roosevelt Bouie?

—The 1980 baseball season
may or may not get under way
thanks to a notion by the
players that they aren’t paid
enough. Don’t get me wrong, I
think arbitration is wonderful.
In fact, the next time I get a low
grade, I’m going to get Marvin
Miller to argue my case.

—My favorite hockey team,
the Washington Capitals, is
‘“‘marching”’ to the playoffs. Ac-
tually, 16 of 21 teams in the NHL
can qualify for the playoffs.
Talk about an elitest society.

—My favorite basketball
team, the Washington Bullets,
is also ‘‘marching’’ to the
playoffs, according to the pro-
moters. The Bullets haven’t
been at the .500 level since the
season was a month old. Big
joke trying to accept the theory
of sub .500 teams qualifying for
a postseason spot.

—Speaking of he who laughs
last, isn’t it amusing that CBS
has scheduled all of its late-nite
NBA telecasts to include the
San Diego Clippers. Un-
fortunately for CBS, the Clip-
pers are minus the services of
both Bill Walton and Lloyd Free
for the rest of the regular
season.

—Have any of you seen the
cola ad which features the
Olympic goalie, Jim Craig?
Talk about cornball! I could
handle Mean Joe Greene slugg-
ing down a soda after getting
beat up and then giving his
jersey to some kid, but the
Craig ad goes overboard.
Maybe I’m just having a
delayed reaction to an overdose
of the Winter Olympics.

—Speaking of the Olympics,
wasn’t it amusing to see the
European countries vote
against Carter’s boycott? The
best idea I have heard yet is for
the American team to par-
ticipate in the games but not be
present at either the opening or
closing ceremonies,

 
 
 

Wood each had three tallies to
lead a blaanced scoring attack.

The game was so lopsided at
the end of the first quarter (it
was 8-1 at the time) that Coaeh
Jack Emmer pulled starting
goalie Bob Clements and
replaced him with sophomore
Ware Palmer.

By halftime, the score was
14-1 in favor of W&L and a ma-
jority of the 1300 people on hand -

decided to they had had enough.

Using mostly second and third
string units, the Generals still
outscored the Air Force 6-5 in
the second half.

With a perfect record and two
of the season’s tougher op-
ponets already disposed of, the
Generals are in prime position
to gain an NCAA playoff berth.
Even more important to the
team is keeping the
psychological advantage of be-
ing in one of the top four posi-
tions.

If the playoffs were held to-
day and positions were decided
by ranking, the Generals would
be at home against Maryland. A
No. 4 seeding in the playoffs
would make possible an en-
counter with the top-seeded
team in the semi-finals.

But from the three games
already played, several pat-
terns can be seen in this team.
For one, the Generals are one of
the best first half teams in the
country. The Generals are
outscoring their opponents 16-5
in the first quarter and 13-3 in
the second quarter.

Such weak points as face-offs
and clears have also been fixed.
The Generals are clearing ap-
proximately 70% of their clears.
In the face-off department,
John Hooper is winning 60% of
his attempts and freshman
Craig Albanese has won 73% of
his face-offs.

See LAX, page 9

Seasons

—Here’s a trivial note. The
North American Soccer League
begins its regular season in a
few days. The NASL is one of
those leagues that you never
notice until the season is about
half over. Then you wish you
had never noticed it.

—One final note. Talk about
turn-about fair justice. Looking
at this week’s lax poll, you will
see our own Generals at the No.
4 spot. They’re ahead of such
heavyweights as Navy, Cornell
and Maryland. More important-
ly, they will play the current no.
2 and 3 teams here in Lexington
later in the season. Wouldn’t it
be interesting to have a playoff
game at Wilson Field?

Netmen Drop Three To Strong Opponents

By Dale Park

The W&L varsity tennis team
has certainly not been taking
the easy way out lately, facing
three tough Division I teams in
their last three matches.

On Wednesday, March 18,
W&L lost a close match to
James Madison University, 5-4.

The Generals dropped the
first three singles flights to
Madison. Senior co-captain
Stewart Jackson was downed
by his first singles opponent 6-2,
6-4, while his teammate,
freshman Jackson Sharman,
was upended 6-3, 6-3, at the se-
cond position. W&L junior Peter
Lovell, playing third, lost a
tough 7-6 first set, and sueccumb-
ed in the second, 6-2.

Yet W&L rebounded to take
the next three singles. Steady
senior co-captain Dave Con-
stine dropped his opponent, 7-5,
7-5 at the fourth spot and
freshman Steve Denney con-
tinued to have a fine early
season, winning 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 at
fifth singles. At flight-six it was
junior Doug Gaker in a close
5-7, 6-2, 6-4 triumph that evened
the score at 3-3.

At the first doubles, however,
senior Jack Norris and Jackson
dropped a close 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 deci-
sion. Madison clinched the
match with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory
over Gaker and Lovell and the
second spot, Still, W&L’s Con-
stine and Sharman closed out
the scoring with a solid 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 win at third doubles.

 

Baseball Evens
Record At 2-2

By Chris Sisto

It appears that this year’s edi-
tion of the Generals’ baseball
‘team is beginning to break with
some of the dubious traditions
that have plagued W&L teams
in the past.

Last week the Generals had a
2-1 mark and_ established
several firsts. It was the first
time ever that the Generals
beat Randolph-Macon College;
the first time in four years that
a relief pitcher came in and won
a game for the team and, for the
first time in a long while, the
defense went two games in a
row without committing an er-
ror.

The Generals began the week
with a 9-5 win over ODAC oppo-
nent Bridgewater College.

This time the team got
several clutch hits while com-
ing from behind by scoring one
run in the eighth inning and
three in the ninth. Vic Shepherd
went six innings on the mound
for the team and Joel Weston
came in to pick up the first
relief win since the 1976 season.

Head Coach Chuck Kroll said
the win was ‘‘very significant
for us. It was our first ODAC
victory and it was accomplish-
ed by a total team effort.”’ Kroll
pointed out that the team had 14
hits by more than six players.

Last Sunday, the Generals
opened their season at home by
splitting a double-header. W&L
took the first game 2-1 and then
dropped the second game 6-2.

Chip Chiles went the distance
to pick up the win in the first

game, surrendering only two
hits. The game was won in the
last inning when Mark Car-
duner drove in the winning run
with a sacrifice fly.

In the second game, the
Generals started off well when
leadoff hitter Chris Cavalline
homered. In the second inning,
Jeff Haggerty slugged his se-
cond home run of the season
with none on.

But then the team gave up
four hits and committed three
errors, while giving up two runs
in both the sixth and seventh in-
nings.

For the moment, the
Generals are 2-1 in ODAC play,
(2-2 overall) and will next face
Emory & Henry in an away

On Thursday, March 19, the
Generals were at Richmond.
Despite good performances by
most of the team, W&L lost
another close one, 6-3.

Jackson, playing at the first
singles, easily dispatched his
opponent, 6-4, 6-2, while Gaker
walloped his man, 6-4, 6-0, at
sixth. Denny finally fell at fifth
singles but not without a fight,
losing 3-6, 7-6, 6-1.

Both Sharman and Lovell fail-
ed to get on track against tough
opposition. Sharman went
quietly, 6-2, 6-1, while Lovell fell
6-0, 6-1.

The Generals needed all three
doubles to win, yet Jackson and
Norris came up short in a tight

7-5, 6-3 loss at first doubles.

Though Gaker and Lovell breez-
ed to victory at second, 6-1, 6-2,
Constine and Sharman dropped
a pair of tie-breakers in a losing
7-6, 7-6 effort.

At Maryland on Sunday,
March 23, the Generals faced
their toughest Division I oppo-
nent yet. This time, the second
doubles team of Gaker and
Lovell, 7-6, 7-6 winners, were
the only Generals to come out
alive as the Terrapins speared
the Generals, 8-1.

At three positions, however,
W&L was able to take its op-
ponents to three sets.

Sharman, at second singles,
after winning the first set 6-3,
dropped the next two, 6-2, 6-0.
Lovell, at third, lost a tough 2-6,

6-0, 4-6 bout but had an outstan-
ding second set.

In doubles, Jackson and Nor-
ris went the distance before giv-

ing in, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
Although last Monday's
match against George

Washington was rained out, the
Generals are scheduled to play
six matches in seven days.

On March 26, W&L will host
Radford College. On the 27th,
the Generals will travel to
William and Mary.

From March 29 — April 1,
W&L will have four straight
home matches, against, respec-
tively, High Point College, the
University of Charleston,
Brown University, and the
University of North Carolina.

Kaplan, Alfano Are Leaders
As Golfers Survive Opener

By Kip Gordon

The Varsity golfers finally got
their season under way last
week, handing Longwood a

394-414 defeat on Thursday, and -

picking up a pair of victories in
a tri-match against Shepherd
and Bridgetown last Tuesday.

 

double-header. This is, of
course, if the weather holds out.

So far this season, the
Generals have had six of their
ten scheduled games rained
out. Kroll is disappointed about
all the cancellations saying,
“It’s too bad we can’t play more
games at this point in the

_ season. The players are really

enjoying the game this year.”’

Winning games does seem to
make people feel this way.

The tri-match against
Shepherd and Bridgewater
brought the Generals two more
easy victories, as the golfers
fired a 396 to Bridgewater’s 412
and Shepherd’s 453. Alfano took
the low honors, firing a 74 on the

Ingleside course in Staunton.
Rookie golfer Bert Ponder
again carded a respectable 78.
Barousse shot 80, while Junior
Steve Everette and Jim Kaplan
each shot 82.

Although the scores on the
whole have not been im-
pressive, they can at least in
part be explained by the less
than ideal weather conditions,
and the fact that the golfers
have yet to face challenging
competition. But their quality of
play thus far was summarized
best in Coach Buck Leslie’s
comment following’ the
trimatch victory; ‘It ain’t pret-
ty, men, but it’s a win.”’

EC Debates Candidate’s Overspending

(continued from page 1)
and preceded the write-in status
debate.

Secretary Cove Geary said
Lowe already benefitted from
his campaigning, and should be
disqualified for that reason.

EC Vice President Les Cotter,
who attended the meeting
despite the pain of a recently
broken nose, also favored dis-
qualifying Lowe because of the
rule setting meeting.

‘John Lowe has a respon-
sibility like any other can-
didate, a responsibility he has
not lived up to,” said Cotter.

Sophomore Representative
Jim Wenke opposed Lowe’s par-
ticipation in the campaign
because, ‘‘all the money was
spent on that campaign.”’

Junior Representative Bob
Willis asked Neely to read the
VRB regulations on spending.

After Neely read the regula-
tions Willis said, ‘‘the statement
was Clear that there was a $10
spending limit on the cam-
paign.”’

Although the rules governing
the election seemed clear to
several representatives, other
EC members said the rules
were unclear.

Blumberg disagreed with Cot-
ter and Geary that the rules
were clear and said the lack of
clarity caused the problem.

“‘T see this situation as a con-
sequence of not having the VRB
rules specific enough to work in
this case,’’ said Blumberg.

Abraham said, ‘‘I think the
rules say the campaign should
not spend more than $10.”’

Neely added that no rule
could cover every aspect of the
campaign.

“The fact that you passed a
rule that did not fit your needs
does not solve the problem of
the rule that you did pass,” said
First Year Law Representative
Sam Allen in response to Neely
and Abraham’s comments.

Abraham‘said the EC had to
decide what was fair for Lowe
and what was fair for the whole
election.

Nelson Ould and Bruce Poole at Sunday’s special EC meeting.

Allen brought the discussion
back to the rules and asked the
EC if it planned to regulate
what other people did for a can-
didate. .

“Maybe the specifics will
have to be spelled out,”
Abraham said.

Nelson Ould, Sophomore
Representative, also questioned
the VRB rules.

“‘We have rules here that do
not spell out what we mean,”
said Ould in reference to the
spending limitations.

“We or the VRB are at fault
for not specifically spelling out
the rules,”’ he added.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Ould and pro-
posed a motion that the EC not
accept the VRB’s recommenda-
tion to disqualify Lowe from the
election.

debate and the sides had been

Bob Willis proposed the vote
on this matter by secret ballot.

(If one member of the EC re-
quests a secret ballot, the EC is
required to use it. )

But Allen and Poole opposed
using the secret ballot.

“If you use the secret ballot I
swear I will do it for every vote
for the rest of the year,” said
Allen.

“I agree, we have a respon-
sibility, people have to know
how we voted,” said Poole.

Willis withdrew his call for
the secret ballot. He said it was
obvious how he felt, but that he
wanted to protect other EC
members.

The vote to disregard the
VRB recommendation failed
46-1. Blumberg, Ould, Allen
and Poole voted in favor of the
recommendation Keesler,
Geary, Abraham, Cotter,
Wenke and Willis opposed it.

mund Schenecker abstained
from voting in this and on the
other three votes that night.

In a subsequent vote the EC
decided to accept the VRB
recommendation.

The second vote mirrored the
first, with the same four EC
members voting to keep Lowe
on the ballot, the same six mov-
ing he be withdrawn from the
race, and Schenecker abstain-
ing.

The EC did have a short
break in the action between the
first two votes as it decided
whether it needed a two-thirds
vote to strike a candidate’s
name from the ballot.

The central issue in the third
and fourth votes was if Lowe

should be allowed to run if he
violated the spending limit.

Several EC members said
Lowe should be totally dis-
qualified, but others said he had
become a potential write-in can-
didate since his name was taken
off the ballot.

It appeared the EC thought
another vote would give Lowe
the status of a write-in can-
didate.

The vote to do so stalled 5-5-1,
and it looked like Lowe was out
of the race.

But Blumberg pointed out the
EC had voted against one of its
own stipulations, “‘that a valid
ballot was one which is cast for
a student.”’

Allen, Poole, and Blumberg
said the privilege to vote in the
election belongs to every stu-
dent unless taken away.

So the EC voted again, this
time to take away Lowe’s right
to be a write-in candidate.

The vote failed 5-5-1, with
Ould, Poole, Blumberg, Keesler
and Allen voting to keep Lowe
in the race.

Abraham, Geary, Cotter,
Willis and Wenke voted to dis-
qualify Lowe.

Schenecker abstained from
the vote.

Neely said that in his opinion
the EC was trying to place
grades on different types of dis-
qualification.

The EC agreed, and deadlock-
ed again, leaving Lowe in a
position to run for the office.

WLUR Opera Schedule

Performances of old and new
favorites will be featured in the
final four weeks of Metropolitan
Opera matinee broadcasts,
heard each Saturday afternoon
on WLUR-FM, the Washington
and Lee University radio sta-
tion.

Giacomo Puccini’s popular
“Manon Lescaut” will in-
augurate this final Met series
next Saturday (Mar. 29) at 2
p.m. Singing principal roles in
this new version of the classic
tragedy will be soprano Renata
Scotto, tenor Placido Domingo,
baritone Renato Capecchi and
tenor Philip Creech. James
Levine will conduct. Opera
News on the Air and Texaco’s
Opera Quiz will be among the
various intermission features.

“Parsifal’’ will follow on
April 5, starting at 1 p.m. It is
the only opera.by Wagner to be
heard this season. And a long-
absent masterpiece will return

to the broadcast circuit on April
12 at 2 p.m., Mozart’s “The Ab-
duction From the Seraglio.”’ An
early work by the classical
master, ‘‘Abduction’’ was last
broadcast over the Texaco-
Metropolitan network in 1947.

Closing the Met’s 40th an-
niversary season of matinee
broadcasts on April 19 at 1 p.m.
will be the modern classic ‘‘Bil-
‘ly Budd,” composed by Ben-~
jamin Britten and _ initially
presented last season at the
opera house in Lincoln Center.
Based on the story by Herman
Melville, the opera had its
premiere at London’s Covent
Garden in 1951. Among its
several unique characteristics
are its absence of any love in-
terest and an exclusively male
cast, as well as its virtual
absence of arias and ensemble
numbers.

WLUR is at 91.5 on the FM
dial.

Overall, the team is showing
an incredible amount of depth.
Three players are in scoring
double figures and eight players
are averaging at least one goal
per game.

Leading the scoring parade is
Kearney, who is averaging
three goals per contest. At this
rate, he would come close to his
39 goal total of his freshman
year. Behind Kearney are
Staugaitis and Mike Pressler.

Pressler and Staugaitis are
typical of this year’s success.
Both players are replacements
for last years’ AllAmerican duo
of Jeff Fritz and Johnny Black.

So far, both Pressler and
Staugaitis have scored five
assists in a game. Like
Kearney, Pressler has 11
points. Staugaitis is the team’s
third leading scorer with ten
points.

The Generals’ depth is

~ “especially if he is a head coach

On the average each coach
receives three to four courses a
semester. Coach Joseph Lyles
has a full time teaching load
and teaches between six and
eight courses a semester. He
also is the head of the Rules
Committee for NCAA Division
III sports. He is currently
finishing his term of office.

Lyles arrived at W&L in 1959
after playing professional
sports. His first year here he
coached freshman basketball,
soccer and baseball. 1977 was
his last year as soccer coach.

In late February of 1978, a
W&L student, also on the varsi-
ty baseball squad at that time,
went to President R.E.R.
Huntley to complain about the
condition and general attitudes
surrounding the baseball team.
He said he felt there was a lack
of respect for the sport within
the P.E.department itself and
cited one instence where an
employee at the gym made
derogatory statements about
the sport in front of the coach,
Joseph Lyles.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC Antics

A lot of editorial fodder from the student body Ex-
ecutive Committee this week. So much so that it’s
hard to know where to begin. Let’s start with next
year’s EC President Bob Willis.

During Sunday’s special emergency session to
remove John Lowe from the freshman ballot, Willis
requested a secret ballot on the first vote. Bob has
always been for justice and accountability in the past.
So we cannot say what motivated his request Sunday
for anonimity and his attempt to escape accountabili-
ty for his fellow EC members on an important and
controversial vote. Certainly, he must realize what
bad practice a secret vote would have been.

No one remembers, but a few years ago open
meetings were a big issue. The current EC President
championed open meetings and open votes so the

- students could see how they are represented. We hope
this tradition will continue next year, but it’s off toa
shaky start.

Then we have Ed Schenecker, the freshman EC
representative. Mr. Schenecker distinguished himself
this week for his indecisiveness. We had been
withholding judgment on the freshman rep., but his
incredible inability to choose his conscience on a
variety of issues is astounding.

Monday, he couldn't |
decide whether or not the |
EC should print forms so
that students could have
their class rank sent our
with their transcripts.
Not a particularly con-
troversial issue. The rest
of the EC favored this
scheme, but Ed
Schenecker  couldn’t
decide how he felt, so he 2
abstained. The next vote }}
was about making future
EC recommendations in :
writing so they will have
more impact. Again, not a very difficult topic. Ed had
trouble with this one too, but it passed without his sup-
port by an 11-0 margin.

The most serious situation was Sunday’s debate
over whether Schenecker’s fellow freshman John
Lowe might possibly be thrown off out of the cam-
paign. There were four votes in all: two concerning
taking Lowe off the ballot and two on whether Lowe
should be allowed to run as a write-in candidate. The
battle lines were drawn dead even with five who
wanted Lowe out and five who wanted to let him stay
in the race. But Ed, with the tie-breaking vote, abs-
tained again.

This was an issue of whether a fellow classmate
would be allowed to be a candidate for a position Mr.
Schenecker now holds—possibly one of the most im-
portant EC votes this year. Certainly one during
which the freshman EC representative should have
made his opinion known. It is unconscionable that he
did not vote on an issue as important as a candidate’s
eligibility.

(The real irony of Sunday’s EC meeting was that
although a majority of representatives thought Lowe
should be taken off the ballot for overspending his
budget, they gave him an additional $10 to finance his
run-off campaign just like everyone else. Fundraiser
anyone? )

Shower Still
Unexplained

Dear Editor:

The University administra-
tion is grateful to The Ring-tum
Phi for having brought the mat-
ter of the shower facility in Mc-
Cormick to its attention.

Neither Dean Atwood or any-
one in a position of responsibili-
ty can recall requesting the in-
stallation of a shower as a part
of the toilet facilities. It is cer-
tainly not our practice to pro-
vide bathing facilities in
academic buildings.

One can only speculate as to
how the shower became a part
of the renovation plans, for no
references to it are included in
the architectural conference
memoranda that trace the
development of the project.
Often in planning discussions
with architects there will be
facetious remarks, recognized
as such by all present, and
dismissed from further con-
sideration. It is conceivable
that a comment about a shower,
made in jest, was taken serious-
ly by the architects, became
part of the design, and was not
spotted here during later
review meetings.

The University has requested
its architects to study more
useful functions of the. space
now designated as a shower.

and Coordinator of
Physical Planning

Auditorium

Dear Editor:

In all my connection with
Washington and Lee, I’ve never
seen anything approaching the
consistence with which almost
everybody gets the name of the
auditorium in the new
undergraduate library wrong.
(Even my office used to be no
exception. But at least we have
learned. )

It is an understandable error.
Even the library itself made the
mistake not long ago in a widely
circulated memorandum. The
poster put up by the faculty’s
Glasgow Committee this week
has it wrong.

(The Ring-tum Phi routinely
has it right. But apparently
everyone assumes it is simply a
routine typographical error. )

The name is Northen.

Not as in the compass direc-
tion, northern.

name of the auditorium.

Call For

Reason

Dear Editor:

I should like to ask that any
readers who are advocates of
the philosophy of Objectivism
please contact me at 463-2725.

The philosophical vacuum in
which we presently live is
pathetic and stifling.

To any individual who
recognizes the absoluteness of
reality, the supremacy of
reason, the moridity of rational
self-interest, and the sovereign-
ty of the individual in society —
I extend an invitation to engage
in some valuable and all-too-
rare philosophical rationality.

Symbols Of Worth And Merit

There are few greater trivialities than those
signs by which we judge each other’s worth.

Ideally, a person should have a sense of his own
worth. Since each individual must determine his
respective values and standards, only that person
can really decide whether or not he has met his
own goals. Others will criticize and praise, but
ultimately it is a matter of personal reflection.

Yet, since we are notoriously social beings, we
are not satisfied with simply knowing privately
that we have answered self-imposed requirements
and limits. No, we must seek out rewards for our
talents and behavior in order that we may reap the
homage due us by society.

These overt symbols of our worth and merit take
on many forms. Acumen in financial matters is
rewarded by wealth and demonstrated by either
the subtlety or gaudiness in which one parades
one’s possessions. Success in academia is amply
proven by framed diplomas, admission into
credential fraternities, and little keys in one’s vest
pocket. Socially, one’s prowess is judged by the
quality and quantity of one’s consumption of
females and alcohol.

I really have no gripe against these quirks of
human nature. I strive just as mindlessly after

them as everyone else. In fact, no one really pays
attention to these things unless they are too pain-
fully silly. But because I’ve got some C-school
classes, and do not want to be showered with
abuse, I’m not going to get into specifics.

I do, however, have a suggestion. What we real-
ly need is someone to determine universal stan-
dards by which we can judge each other. As it
stands now, economically strapped academics
make fun of the Babbits of the business world
while the money moguls wonder aloud about the
subversives who teach all those subsidized
athletes.

What we need is the Wizard of Oz.

As he fully demonstrated with the Lion, the Tin-
man, and the Scarecrow, the Wiz knew which
rewards represented which qualities to our socie-
ty. All we have to do is ask the old guy to draw upa
master list with some form of graduated
equivilancy ratings and we’ll all be set. No one will
have to keep up with the Jones, run for resume
padding.offices, or make the honor role because
their ratings will already be set. Just check the list
and you'll know exactly how arrogant or humble
you can act.

Simple, huh?
 

E Commentary

By Richard Moss

As we have now passed two of the more
strategic primary states in our presidential selec-
tion process, Illinois and New York, it may be
worthwhile for a minute to sit back and reflect
upon that process.

Recent opinion polls and studies of voter
registration have shown that the percentage of
Americans who register as independents is grow-
ing steadily. If this tread continues, the studies
show, independents may soon outnumber Demo-
cratic and Republican party voters. Nowhere is
this increase more evident than in the campaign of
John Anderson, who has relied almost solely on
the independent and cross-over vote to strengthen
his campaign. We must ask ourselves what effect
this trend may have on our two-party system.

Obviously, if we reach the point where indepen-
dent voters outnumber all party voters, then we
must conclude that the two-party system is inade-
quate. It would no longer be representative of the
majority of the voters, and therefore would not be
a viable process for selecting the leaders of our
country.

We appear to be living today in a country whose
political needs are best exemplified by the term
“broker state.’’ There are thousands of special in-
terest groups, each assaulting our political
leaders for the purpose of attaining their own
goals. Nowhere is this more evident than on
Capitol Hill, where lobbying has grown into a
highly appreciated art form, although one of ques-
tionable . morality. This constant barrage of
special interests, many of which conflict, is, it
seems, becoming a strain which two parties alone
canoe bear.

Thoughts On Our Political Process

For this reason, many voters may be faced next
November with a choice between two candidates,
neither of whom represent the voter’s particular
needs in selecting this nation’s chief executive.
While we have not yet reached the point where a
majority of voters are in this position, we must
consider its growth, and the effects that growth
will have.

In all likelihood, the effect will be a spiraling
growth of political apathy as the result of discon-
tent with the way our country is being run. When
faced with only two candidates at the end of the
primaries and party conventions, we find many
voters either not voting at all, or deciding upon the
“Jesser of two evils,” a phrase which has been
bandied about for the past 10 or 20 years in regard
to presidential elections.

Certainly, we will never be able to please all of
the people all of the time, but it would be hoped
that we could please most of the people most of the
time with our political system process. Indeed, it
must be so, otherwise the system would not and
will not work. Traditions (i.e. the two-party
system) are fine, and are necessary to calm the
volatility of our present age. However, a tradition,
when it becomes stagnant, when it no longer
fulfills the needs of the people, must be changed.

It may be feasible to organize a new party, to
utilize a multi-party system such as is in use in
some European countries, or even to have just one
election day. with many candidates and to do away
with the primary process. In any event, if this
trend continues, something must be done to
change the presidential selection process, or we
may be faced with more than just political apathy
and disgruntlement in this country. We must look
toward the future. -

SAB Bands And Pavilion Structures

Dear Editor,

Each year the Student Ac-
tivities Board discusses the
possibility of hiring a large
band for the party held on the
Thursday night before Fancy
Dress. Until two years ago, the
SAB had succeeded, bringing
large bands such as ‘‘The Four
Tops” and “Atlanta Rhythm
Section.”’

Unfortunately, this tradition
came to a screeching halt in ’77
when a fight erupted at a ‘‘Four
Tops’ concert on Thursday

night; the fight resulted in one
student having a bottle broken
over his face and the other leav-
ing the school.

The fight solicited a response
from the administration that
consisted of an unwritten ‘‘NO”’
to any more large bands play-
ing at the Thursday night party.
This “NO” forced the SAB to
literally turn away ‘‘Tavares’”’
the following year when they
would have played at the party
for a very cheap price.

I would not like to see such op-

portunities missed in the years
to come.

The year, following the ad-
ministration’s instructions, the
SAB hired two bands for the
Thursday night party that
would be playing again that
weekend at several frater-
nities; thus they were con-
sidered a smaller band.

If the administration’s
philosophy held true, less peo-
ple would be attracted to the
party, thus making it more safe
for those attending, and plus if
there was no beer served there
would be fewer intoxicated peo-
ple.

After one of the bands had
finished one of its sets, a mob of
people began moving for the
door; at the same time a few
people began trying to come in
the door. What resulted was a
shoving match between those
coming and going (about 20-40
people) for control of a small
door that seemed to be the only
exit. This was a much more
potentially dangerous situation
as has been demonstrated at a
“Who” concert in Ohio; so-
meone could have fallen and
been trampled.

Furthermore, inside the
pavilion there were so many
people that it was hard to
breathe.

Had something happened,
such as one of the gas heaters
caught on fire, it would have
taken a fatally long time to get
everyone out, plus the rush for
the door would have knocked
some people down and trampl-

Against Co-education

Dear Editor:

When Jack Willhite’s com-
mentary “Free To Choose”’ ap-
peared in the paper of March 13,
it was only to be expected that
the pro-coeducation camp
would be heard from on the
20th. One might have hoped,
however, that they could have
made a better response. All Mr.
Wilson could do was to mock
Jack’s clever approach, while
Mr. Clarke’s objections,
although more rationally based,
are somewhat flawed.

Mr. Willhite said just about
everything there was to say
about co-education, but several
points raised on the 20th
deserve to be answered. Mr.
Clarke does not believe that
there is much demand for
single-sex schools,
most of us are here at W&L for
other reasons — such as
academic quality. He also
believes that the academic
quality of a W&L education
would be improved by the addi-
tion of women to the student
body.

This strikes me as quite
strange. If people chose W&L
because of the quality of the
education, choosing it over hun-
dreds of co-educational schools,
might that either be a sign that:
a) the quality of education at
W&L is superior to that of
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women) or b) Mr.
Clarke is wrong and people
chose W&L because it is all
male.

Of particular ludicrousness is
Mr. Clarke’s ‘‘other problem.”’
Perhaps students who have
spent most of their years in co-
ed schools would have some dif-
ficulty understanding what it
means to attend a men’s school.
Perhaps. Mr. Clarke chooses,

but that |

though, to forget that each year
about half of our incoming
freshmen come _ from
preperatory, not public,
schools, many of which are not
co-ed. These people know what
sort of a situation they are
entering and yet they enter it.
Could it be one which they like?

Something Messrs. Wilson
and Clarke ought to bear in
mind too is that any attempt to
change the basic structure of
the University is going to take
time. If W&L were to decide to
go co-ed, none of us here now
would still be here to see the
decision implemented. What
would have happened is that
some of today’s students would
have succeeded in imposing
their views on all of tomorrow’s
students.

W&L is bigger than any stu-
dent. I dare say that every stu-
dent finds something here
which he does not like. If the
school were to change each of
the things disliked by every stu-
dent, it would not be W&L, in-
deed it would not bear any
resemblance to W&L.
Therefore, let those who like it
here stay, while those who wish
to destroy W&L leave. Let’s re-
main, as Jack suggests, free to
choose.

Drivel And
Wahoos

Dear Editor:

After reading the incessant,
incoherent drivel that Bill
Whalen has inflicted on us about
the ACC basketball teams In

but one thing to say after their
NIT Tournament win this even-
ing! How about those Wahoos!

ed them in the process of get-
ting out.

And as for fewer intoxicated
people, the floor was littered
with masses of broken bottles
and cans; there was even one
car off the road before the party
started.

The administration’s philos-
ophy obviously failed this year;
you can’t keep people away
from the party, they are going

to fight.

What you can do is protect the
people attending, and this can
be done by providing a facility
with enough room to breathe,
serving beer in paper cups thus
keeping the broken bottles and
cans out which could seriously
cut someone and also be used as
a weapon. Providing a facility
with enough exits to prevent the
bottle-necking of people, and
fast escape in the event of an

to drink, and it is human nature

IFC Voting Blocks

Interfraternity Council elections were held Tuesday night and a
specter, believed dead or gone, came back to haunt the body which
runs and adjudicates in fraternity affairs.

Nine of W&L’s 17 fraternities decided who would hold seven of
nine elected posts on the IFC. Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi
Kappa Phi, Zeta Beta Tau, Lambda Chi Alpha, Chi Psi and Kappa
Sigma formed a block and selected a slate of candidates to fill posi-
tions on the IFC.

In the past a ‘“‘Red Square’’ machine has elected its candidates,
sometimes to the detriment of other fraternities, and the inter-
fraternity system. Only an oracle or a mystic can say for sure what
type of job the persons elected by this ‘‘machine”’ will do.

But chances are the ‘‘non-Red Square” machine will serve the
same purpose the recently deceased ‘‘Red Square” machine did;
keeping its own people in office and out of trouble.

Maybe the new machine has more high-minded principles in its
sights, then maybe it does not. In either case, the problem remains
the same no matter which machine puts people in office; frater-
nites do not get the best man for the job when they vote in blocks.
IFC office-holders should be elected on merit, not fraternity affilia-
tion.

At least one non-Red Square fraternity was approached, given a
slate of candidates which included one of its members, and was
asked to join the new voting block. That fraternity refused because
it wanted to vote for the best candidates, not a block.

On a judicial body such as the IFC, experience is a necessity for
the members who listen and make rulings in discipline cases.

Yet one candidate, who has a year’s experience and has done a
fine job according to other Judicial Board members, will not sit on
the IFC next year. He is a member of a Red Square fraternity and
was subsequently excluded from the slate of candidates.

While experience on the IFC is valuable, so is experience within
the fraternity sytem. The block vote has placed juniors in two im-
portant positions, secretary and treasurer. Kappa Sigma is only a
colony with hopes of becoming a fraternity, yet it has a representati
ve. While Kappa Sigma’s man may prove himself competent, he
has not lived in a fraternity house or in the fraternity system for
very long. In terms of actual experience with fraternities, he is in
the same position as most fraternity sophomores who have only
seen a fraternity function from the inside for a year.

This year’s IFC faced a difficult, if not impossible task, it had to
revitalize an embattled and sagging fraternity system. And
because the IFC had a diverse and experienced group, it came
through shining. A good IFC has put fraternities on the path back
up to respectibility.

Next year will be just as crucial as the year past: fraternities are
making improvements, yet still have a long way to go.

The IFC must be instrumental in prodding fraternities along the
way, and you do not have to ask Syd Farrar just how difficult a task
it can be. But did we, the members of fraternities, really elect the
best candidates to represent and lead us? We should vote for can-
didates on their merit, experience and ability. Have we done this?

It might do well to remember that the guy you elected so your
fraternity brother could be on the IFC, might not be worth endur-

emergency.

 

These solutions would allow a
party to go on without en-
dangering anyone’s safety, but
where are these facilities.

Unfortunately, this is the
heart of the problem. In plann-
ing the large band parties
(other than Fancy Dress), the
SAB has found the facilities that
would fulfill these require-
ments, Doremus Gym, Evans
Dining Hall, and Wilson Field,
for the most part unavailable.

Not only do these facilities
have the necessary exits and
area, they also have the power
and changing rooms that larger
bands require. Then why can’t
we use them?

A special committee is con-
sidering the construction of a
new ‘“‘pavilion-style structure’
costing in the neighborhood of
$110,000. I would urge the com-
mittee to design the facility to
its maximum potential, within
reason, so it would be of max-
imum possible value to the
students.

The building should have the
space to handle large crowds
such as those at the Thursday
night parties before Fancy
Dress.

It should have adequate
bathroom facilities.

It should have four walls and
heat so it can be used all year-
around.

Finally, it should be able to
handle large bands, and for this
it needs 220 power and changing
rooms.

With these suggestions in-
corporated into the design of the

building, it will be large enough
and have enough power to han-
dle the parties planned for
W&L’s major weekends. As
long as you are planning to use
this much money, you might as
well get maximum value out of
what you spend it on.

Unfortunately, the new
pavilion is still at least a year
down the road if approved; until
then I would urge the ad-
ministration and expecially Mr.
Darrell and Mr. McHenry to
work with the SAB exploring
various plans for the use of the
facilities without damaging
them.

After all, the facilities exist
for use by the students as long
as they are not damaged.

With the support of the

students and the help of Steve
Abraham and Bob Willis next
year, I am sure that a solution
can be worked out with the ad-
ministration that will enable the
students to safely use their
facilities for the larger bands.
This plan would enable the SAB
to create a social program that
fits the size and caliber of this
college.

Furthermore, I would en-
courage the quick and complete
construction of the new pavilion
as the best answer to this pro-
blem.

Finally, I encourage anyone
and everyone to voice their opi-
nion to the SAB or the EC and in
their letters to the editor.
