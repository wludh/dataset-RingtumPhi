Students Split
On Coeducation

by John Billmyre

According to a_ report
presented to the Executive
Committee Monday night, the
student body is split down the
middle on the coeducation ques-
tion.

The EC subcommittee on
coeducation decided the student
body is neither in favor of nor
opposed to coeducation.

Subcommittee members Jay
Blumberg, Les Cotter, Palmore
Clarke, Tony Carli and Robert
Neely were on hand to present
their report and make recom-
mendations based on the report.

But before they could make
suggestions, the subcommittee
answered questions from the
EC.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser asked the subcom-
mittee about the second ques-
tion, ‘‘In your opinion, do you
know the advantages and disad-
vantages of coeducation at
W&L?”

“IT wonder whether you think
the second question is phrased
in such a way to ask someone if
they are ignorant,’ Fraser
said. ;

Blumberg said he did not
think so and added the commit-
tee worked with Associate Dean
of Students and Director of
Placement Michael A. Cappetto
to develop good, unbiased ques-
tions.

“IT am not sure if there is a
proper way to ask someone if
they know something,” said
Fraser.

Text Of

The E.C. sub-committee on
coeducation surveyed 145 ran-

during the week of February
11-15, 1980. The 145 subjects
were randomly selected by us-
ing a computer program
developed by the W&L Com-
puter Center. Statistical com-

Junior Representative Bob
Willis questioned the meaning
of the results from the second
and third questions.

He pointed out that 77 percent
of the people polled said they

knew the advantages and disad- ;
vantages of coeducation, and }
the same number of respond- |
ents said they would like to see ,
more public discussion of the 4

coeducation question.

Carli and other subcommittee
members said a correlation
could not be drawn between the
two question.

Before there were any more
inquiries about the questions
Blumberg reminded the EC
that they approved the ques-
tions earlier in the year.

“If the EC tells us the ques-
tions are bad, I am going to be
mad,’ said Blumberg. ‘‘We
brought them to the EC earlier
this year and they were approv-
ed.”
Fraser also asked about the
effect of the pollsters, adding
that Carli had already indicated
his preference for coeducation.

“There was one group . of
questionable answers, so I
made a second call to verify
them,” said Blumberg.

Carli said his answers were
the set which Blumberg review-
ed.

Fraser then proposed the EC

accept the subcommittee’s
report.

The motion passed
unanimously.

Law Student Arrested
After Walking Out Of Ted’s

By Guy Sweet

A legally minor altercation at
Ted’s Restaurant last Tuesday
night may result in drastic con-
sequences to the restaurant and
toa W&L law student.

The student, William
Nicholson, was arrested Tues-
day night by Lexington police
for failing to pay his bill at
Ted’s. In response, several law
students have said they plan to
boycott the restaurant.

This entire conflict developed
over a $2.35 spaghetti dinner.

At about 6:30 p.m. on Tues-

day, Mar. 24, Nicholson and a

fellow law student, Lester
Bates, entered Ted’s and
ordered dinner.

When Nicholson’s dinner ar-
rived, he said that it ‘tasted
funny,”’ and he told the waitress
to return the spaghetti to the
kitchen.

She gave the dinner to head

cook and owner, Ted Snyder. He -

tasted the spaghetti and said
there was nothing wrong with it,
so the waitress took the plate
back to Nicholson’s table.
Nicholson again insisted that

EC Coeducation Report

error, showed results to be ac-
curate to within plus or minus 2
percent. In other words, the
results contained in this study
approximate (to within plus or
minus 2 percent) those results
which would be found if the en-
tire student body were
surveyed. Simply stated, we
believe these results are highly
accurate and reflect the opinion
of the undergraduate student
body.

The respondents were con-
tacted by telephone’ by
volunteers who had _ been
carefully instructed on how to
ask these questions in an un-
biased manner. (See attached
form.) The three questions
state:

1) Are you in favor of
coeducation at W&L?

2) In your opinion, do you

know the advantages and disad-
vantages of coeducation at
W&L?

3) Would you like to see more
public discussion of this issue?

46.9 percent of those surveyed
were in favor of coeducation at
W&L, 49 percent were against
coeducation, and 4.1 percent
had no opinion on the matter.
The committee feels there is no
clear-cut majority on this ques-
tion. The student body is neither
for nor against coeducation.
Opinion is very evenly split
(Keep in mind the plus or minus
2 percent).

In response to the second
question, 77.9 percent of those
surveyed believe they know the
advantages and disadvantages
of coeducation; 15.2 percent feel
that they did not know the ad-
vantages and disadvantages;

6.2 percent had no opinion on
the matter; and 0.7 percent
refused to answer. The commit-
tee feels that there is a clear
distinction between the two
groups and concludes that the
majority of those sampled
believe they know the facts.

Finally, in response to the
third question, 77.1 percent of
the sample would like to see
more public discussion of
coeducation; 17.4 percent would
not like ‘to see more public
discussion; and 5.6 percent
have no opinion. The committee
concludes that a majority of
students would like to see more
public discussion of coeducation
and recommends that the Ring-
tum Phi use this report to begin
a coeducation forum.

something was wrong with the
meal and ordered a lasagna din-
ner.

Snyder prepared the lasagna
but told the waitress to bill
Nicholson for the spaghetti din-
ner because there was nothing
wrong with it. She did so and
later stated that Nicholson
never asked her whether he
would be billed.

Nicholson’s bill totalled
$20.51, including the spaghetti
dinner. Nicholson told the
cashier that he would not pay
for a meal that he did not eat.

Snyder, who was seated near
the cash register, approached
Nicholson and demanded the
full amount.

“I tried two or three times to
pay the undisputed portion, but
he (Snyder) insisted on ‘all or
nothing’,’’ said Nicholson. ‘‘He
also said that he was going to
swear out an arrest warrant if I
didn’t pay the full bill.”

Nicholson then walked out of
the restaurant at about 9 p.m.
At the urgings of Bates,
however, Nicholson wrote out a
check for $18.16 and left it on the
spike next to the cash register.
This check did not cover the
spaghetti dinner.

Immediately after Nichol-
son’s departure, Snyder went to
the Lexington Police Station
and swore out a criminal com-
plaint, charging Nicholson with
unlawfully procurring food
without paying and with intent
to defraud an innkeeper.

Progress Report On The Boxwood Incident

by John Hastings

The anger and frustration of
the ‘Boxwood Incident” has
passed and now students and
faculty are turning their atten-
tion to final examinations and
Spring break. The fate of the
students involved in the inci-
dent, however, is notso simple.

All seven of the remaining
students who were involved in
the December damage of
several boxwood bushes around
campus are each performing
eight hours of manual labor a
week in some form of campus
or community-related project.
Along with their labors, the
seven were also placed on
Social Probation for the re-
mainder of the school year and
on Conduct Probation for the
rest of their W&L careers by the

Student Control Committee.
One aspect often overlooked
in considering the punishment
of the students is that they are
responsible for repayment to
the University for the damage
of the bushes. According to Tim
Brooks, chairman of the Stu-
dent Control Committee, the
University’s lawyer has con-
tacted all the families involved
and repayment is being worked
out on an individual basis.
Recently six of the students
worked for the Historic
Rockbridge Society chipping,
priming and painting walls. A
spokesman for Historic
Rockbridge, Dick Fletcher,
spoke highly of their work and
was impressed by their good at-
titude. The seventh member of
the group was doing clerical

work at Stonewall Jackson
House.

Another ‘‘satisfied customer”
of the group’s efforts is Jerry
Darrell, who sent a letter of
commendation to Brooks when
the students cleaned Evans Din-
ing Hall after the Muscular
Dystrophy Dance Marathon.
The work was done from 2-6
a.m. in order to prepare for the
next day’s meals.

Another plan for their labor
calls for a cleaning of the cross-
country course, which came at
the request of Asst. Director of
Athletics Dick Miller. Also in
the works, says Brooks, ‘“‘is the
possibility of using them to help
clean the gym after Mock Con-
vention.”’ Brooks added that he
was working with Lexington Ci-
ty Manager John Doane to find

Toland Lives The Life Of A Writer

by Ed Edge

Talent is not the main thing to
possess if you are to write; you
must have the stubbornness and
willingness to live the life of a
writer, well-known author and
noted historian John Toland
said when he lectured in Nor-
then Auditorium last Thursday
night.

Toland was presented by the
East Asian Studies program
and the history department of
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty.

Toland, who paid his way
through college by running the
campus book store and playing
bridge, told all those interested
in becoming writers not to get
upset if they are not immediate
success, adding that he did not
have anything published until
he was 42 years old.

“I wrote articles on anything
from impotency to...well, you
name it, and even dropped my
first wife before anything I
wrote was published,’ he said,
adding that dropping your first
wife is, by no means, the way to
gain success, even though it did
work for him.

After going through the files
of reporters to gain the informa-
tion for his work, and not being
totally satisfied with the ac-
curacy of the material he had
obtained, Toland decided that
he should resort to interviewing
the people who were actually in-
volved in whatever he was
writing on.

“I’m interested in the way
human beings are; other
writers have ignored humani-
ty,”’ he said and added, “The
people who were there are the

Plans Soon!

ones who know what happen-
ed.”’

Toland’s book, The Rising
Sun, came as the result of ex-
tensive interviewing in Japan.

Toland said he ignored any
advise offered him and followed
instinct in his research and in-
terviewing, and succeeded in
gaining the trust of a person
who led him to some buried
records that were believed to
have been destroyed.

“Once they found out that I
was seeking to tell the true
story of World War II Japan,
the Japanese were eager to talk
to me—the losers are easier to
talk to than the winners (who
write history ),”’ he said.

“Real fact is what I’m in-
terested in. I need to know the
plot of what I’m going to write
about,’ Toland said.

some area where the group
could be useful. Brooks has also
contacted TAP (Total Action
against Poverty), but has had
noreply.

The Student Control Commit-
tee has received many com-
pliments on their handling of
the affair, from President
Huntley on down. “Because of
the complicated facts and
pressure from the university
community,”’ said Brooks, ‘‘this

was one of the most difficult
decisions any Student Control
has ever faced. Since Student
Control was the only group with
all the facts, we tried to make
the same decision as would the
community if they had all the
facts.’’ Brooks added that at the
time of the incident, most peo-
ple he spoke with were in favor
of suspension and now most see
the committee’s actions as
“fair and reasonable.”’

Coeducation

(continued from page 1)
fraternity members attitudes
proved quite interesting. When
controlling for fraternity
membership we find the follow-
ing figures which show indepen-
dent students much more in
favor of coeducation than
fraternity member students ;

When the committee attemp-
ted to control for students’
class, the number of
respondents became too small
to report with any confidence,
but there appeared to be little
differences on any of the ques-
tions among the four
undergraduate classes.

There is basically one sugges-

tion that this sub-committee
would like to make: We feel that
the student body would like a
public forum on coeducation.
The committee would be willing
to organize a series of debates
on coeducation. These debates
would try to cover all aspects of
coeducation at W&L. Debate
would achieve two goals: It
would allow the 15 percent of
the student body who don’t feel
they know the advantages and
disadvantages of coeducation to
learn those aspects, and it
would also attempt to satisfy
the 77.1 percent of the student
body who would like to see more
public discussion of this issue.

Entertainment

 

 

By John Wells

Once again it’s time for tnat secular Hollywood
orgy of self gratitude: the 52nd annual Academy
Awards will take place on April 14th.

The nominations, announced last month, didn’t
seem to stir great surprise or jealousy among
stellar egos. The major contenders this year ap-
pear to be Kramer vs. Kramer and All That Jazz,
with nine nominations each, Apocalypse Now with
eight, and, to the delight of many, the low-budget
Breaking Away received five nominations.

A look at the individual categories:

Jane Fonda can safely be removed from con-
sideration since she won last year in the Best Ac-
tress category. The nomination may be con-
sidered a nod, and a deserved one, for there are
few actresses of her calibre in the mainstream to-
day. Marsha Mason and Bette Midler seem to be
long shots (particularly the latter, in my opinion).

It used to be considered normal in Hollywood for
an actor or actress to win an Oscar for a ques-
tionable performance out of sympathy for an
undeserved loss the previous year. (It happened to
Jimmy Stewart when he lost for Mr. Smith ).
Although belated recognition for Jill Clayburgh’s
An Unmarried Women would be nice, Starting
Over isn’t the picture and the tradition is dead.
I’m putting my money on Sally Field who had the
title role in Martin Ritt’s Norma Rae.

Dustin Hoffman seems like a shoo-in for Best
Actor; he was fine in Kramer, and has never won
before despite The Graduate and Midnight
Cowboy. Recent years have proved such criteria
unreliable, but Hoffman might be the exception.
Jack Lemmon deserves it for China Syndrome,
but he just won a few years back. Don’t count on
Roy Schneider or Al Pacino (yet). If Hoffman
doesn’t get it, it seems highly likely that Peter
Sellers will win for Being There.

The supporting categories are a mess: Meryl
Streep has received more praise lately than prac-
tically anyone and while she deserves it, it would
be nice if she held out for the big stuff in a year or
so. She may be cancelled out by Jane Alexander,
another fine actress, who was also nominated for
Kramer. Mariel Hemingway can act circles
around her mush-mouthed sister but she probably
won’t get it, and who even heard of Barbara Bar-
rie? Candice Bergen may be a banquet for the
eyes, but I hope to God she doesn’t win for Starting
Over.

The seemingly yearly lets-give-something-to-
an-old-timer ordeal this year concentrates on the
venerable Melvyn Douglas (Being There). Who
once co-starred with Garbo and Dietrich, and
Mickey Rooney (The Black Stallion) ,who replaced
Donald O’Conner in the Francis the Talking Mule
Series awhile back. Douglas has won before,

Rooney has not. If there is a stalemate between
these two, the most deserving winner would be

Robert Duvall for his work in Apocalypse Now. I
really don’t think Justin Henry should win simply
as a matter of principle, but he was exceptional in
Kramer VS Kramer. Frederic Forrest provides
feeble competition for The Rose.

It could be rough going for Best Picture.
Realistically, Francis Ford Coppola is a year late
for competition among Vietnam epics, and, not be-
ing a completely satisfying movie for all its chop-
pers and napalm, Apocalypse Now is more likely
to capture other, minor categories. Bob Fosse,
who deserted Hollywood years ago for the theater,
might expect the same for his highly exploited All
That Jazz (I mean, it’s so blatant). Norma Rae
didn’t even nab a Best Direction nomination for
Martin Ritt, making it an unlikely winner. This
leaves the highly praised Kramer in competition
with the equally highly praised Breaking Away
(the production costs for which were probably less
than the Cambodian mortician who supplied the
corpses for Apocalypse). A victory for either one
would be satisfactory.

It does seem a shame that Woody Allen’s
brilliant Manhatten received no more academy at-
tention than it did (probably because the Wood-
man won big with Annie Hall two years ago).
Many believe the academy underrated the widely

acclaimed Black Stallion, Shirley MacLaine’s per-

formance in Being There, and Barbara Harris’ in
The Seduction of Joe Tynan (how about Diane
Keaton in Manhattan?). Perhaps they thought
that they couldn’t nominate Ricky Shroeder for
The Champ because they already had one child
star and two senior citizens vying for Best Sup-
porting Actor.

It’s been years since any one picture has swept
more than five major awards, and this year it
again appears that awards will be apportioned
among several films. It’s important to remember
that The Turning Point and Heaven Can Wait got
something like 11 nominations, but both went
home on Oscar night empty-handed.

Fortunately for everybody concerned, Johnny
Carson will once again host the awards, broadcast
live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los
Angeles. Last year Carson provided customary
wit and kept the intermittently dull proceedings
moving along smoothly. Dolly Parton is a schedul-
ed presenter this year, and I’m sure everyone will
enjoy her introduction by Johnny. It has been an-
nounced that a special award will be given this
year to Alec Guiness for his various contributions,
etc., to the industry (you’d think they could have
waited at least a couple of years after honoring
Laurence Olivier). Nominations for Best Song will
be performed in lavish production numbers.

So if you’re so inclined this vacation, on April
14th you can witness generations of luminaries
participating in a ritual of thrills, chills and excite-

Bernot Named
All-American

Mike Bernot, a Washington &
Lee sophomore, received All-
America recognition for his per-
formances in the 50 and 100
yard freestyle events at the
NCAA Division III Champion-
ship swim meet, held March
20-22 at Washington & Jefferson
College.

In both events, Bernot com-
peted in the consolation finals,
where he set school records to

go along with the All-America
Awards. The finals in each
event consisted of the top six
swimmers from the
preliminary competition; the
consolation finals consisted of
the following six swimmers.

Bernot’s award in the 50-yard
event came Thursday, March

field, he advanced to 10th place
during the preliminary com-
petition. In the consolation final
he turned in a time of 21.83
seconds, breaking the W&L
record of 22.00 set by Tad Van
Leer in 1977.

Bernot’s award in the 100-
yard event came Saturday.
Seeded 37th in a 54-man field, he
advanced to 11th place during

The W&L varisty tennis team
ended the month of March by
winning two of its last five mat-
ches as the netmen continued to
play tough Division I and II
competition.

On Wednesday, March 26th,
the Generals defeated visiting
Division II Radford College, 6-3.

Senior co-captain Stewart
Jackson got W&L off to a good
start with his 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory
at first singles. Both junior
Peter Lovell (third singles) and
senior co-captain Dave Con-
Stine (fourth singles) followed
suit.

Lovell trounced his opponent
6-2, 6-0,.while Constine breezed
to a 6-4, 6-4 win. The final
singles victory was registered
by junior Doug Gaker, who
went the limit in a decisive 6-2,

3-6, 7-5 victory at sixth singles.

The Generals needed to win
only one doubles to clinch the
match, yet came away with vic-
tories at the first and second
flights. Jackson and senior Pat
Norris teamed for a 5-7, 6-1, 6-2
win at first doubles, while
Gaker and Lovell had no trouble
in their 6-3, 6-3 triumph at se-
cond.

The following day the
Generals: were away against
William and Mary College.

Despite several close mat-
ches and wins by both Jackson
in singles and Gaker and Lovell
at secend doubles, W&L’s
netmen fell 7-2. Jackson, as in
the previous match, registered
an identical 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph,
while Gaker and Lovell squeez-
ed by their opponents 6-3, 7-6
(5-4 tie-breaker).

Generals Climb To 5-0;

by Robert Massie

The Washington and Lee
Generals walked to their fifth
victory in as many games
Wednesday by defeating the
Virginia Tech Hokies, 24-3,
before a crowd of 1600 on Wilson
Field.

The Generals dominated their
first game on Wilson Field in
two weeks in every category.

With sophomore Ware
Palmer starting in the goal for
the first time this year, the
Generals took 73 shots com-
pared to only 19 for Tech and
captured an impressive 29 of 32
face-offs.

The loss dropped Virginia
Tech to 1-1 on the season. The
Hokies had earlier beaten
Randolph-Macon, 14-9.

The Generals leapt to a quick
9-1 lead in the first period, while
putting in every team member.
Geoff Brent started the scoring,
followed by Art Caltrider, but
Tech scored to cut the lead to
2-1. From the 9:03 mark down,
W&L went on a scoring spree
which resulted ih 19
unanswered goals to put the
lead at 21-1.

Midfielder Rob Carpenter
scored his first career gaoal
while Chris Kearney scored
four times and. Rob Staugaitis
and Mike Pressler each threw
in two.

It wasn’t until the third period
that Tech managed to score
again, one coming with 10:28
left in the third stanza and
another almost nine minutes
later. Both scores came on
extra-man situations.

But that was to be all for the
Hokies. Jay Foster scored the
last goal in the fourth quarter to
end the game at 24-3 in favor of
the Genérals.

The netmen were able to take
only two positions from the
visiting High Point College
team also, losing a 7-2 decision
on Saturday, March 29th. Again
it was Jackson who was one of
the Generals’ bright spots, as he
chalked up a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 win.
Gaker, at flight six, was able to
overcome his opponent, 6-0, 7-6
(5-4 tie-breaker ).

The visiting Division III
University of Charleston team
offered W&L a needed rest.

The Generals had no trouble,
sweeping the singles 6-0, while
dropping only one set. Winners
included Jackson (his fourth
straight win at first), freshman
Jackson Sharman at flight two,
Lovell and Constine at the third
and fourth positions, respec-
tively, freshman Steve Denny
at number five, and Gaker at

Washington and Lee now
leads the Tech series with five
wins and no losses. Leading
scorers in the game included
Kearney with four goals (he
now leads the team with 15
goals in five games), Geoff
Wood with four tallies and
Brent who netted a hat trick.

John Kemp, one of the
Generals’ leading midfielders,
did not play in the Tech game.
Kemp suffered a broken hand
against Towson State but will
return to the line-up against
Virginia on April 20.

Coach Jack Emmer_ was
again pleased with his team’s
performance, commenting:
“We wanted to look sharp
before the Spring break and
before we met Virginia.”

Well Jack, your team looked
just that.

The Washington and Lee
Generals extended _ their

undefeated record to 4-0 with an
11-7 victory over the Towson
State Tigers last Saturday at
Maury Park.

The victory came on the
strength of a fourth quarter ral-

unanswered goals. The victory,
coupled with a Rutgers loss,
moved the Generals into third
place in the NCAA Division I

Jackson finally succumbed at

Baseball Team Keeps Winning Despite

By Chris Sisto

Bad weather continues to
hamper the Generals’ road to a
winning season this spring as
four consecutive games were
cancelled last week due to wet
grounds. This brings the total
number of rain-outs to nine
while the team has only been
able to get six games under
their belt.

Head Coach Chuck Kroll,
however, hasn’t been complain-
ing about the cancellations

since his team’s situation isn’t
unique in Virginia this year, but
he does feel it has hurt the
players. ‘“‘It is difficult to give
everyone a good look with the
amount of games we’ve played
and it’s hard for the pitchers to
get inasetrhythm.”

The team has proven so far
that it can rise above these set-
backs’ When the Generals have
played, they’ve given some
masterful performances, the
most recent being a double-

header sweep against ODAC op-
ponent Emory & Henry last
week.

The score of the first contest
was 2-1, and the Generals com-
pleted the sweep with a 7-0
shutout in the second game. It
was the first time in four years
that W&L has won both games
of a double-header and the first
team this year,’’ Kroll said, ‘‘is
that everyone is getting into the
act.”’

“There hasn’t been one per-

time since then that the
Generals earned a shutout.

Chip Chiles went the distance
on the mound in the first game,
picking up his second win. It
took extra innings to win this
game, however, as reserve out-
fielder Jody Harris drove in the
winning run in the top of the
eighth.

In the second game, Joel
Weston gave up only four hits
and the defense only committed

Weather

one error in serving the win.
“What’s different about the
son who has totally carried the
team this year,” said the
Coach. “The defense has im-
proved significantly and the
winning runs have come froma
number of different people.’’

The team is now 4-2 overall
and 4-1 in ODAC conference
play. Their next opponent is
Clarion State. The Generals
play eight games in eight days
during Spring break.

Generals 5-0 After Overpowering Hokies, 24-3

(continued from page 4)

ran up a 2-0 lead in a first
quarter characterized by less
than admirable play by both
teams. The Generals had trou-
ble clearing the ball with their
passing and trying to get shots
past the Towson State goalie,
Tim Hastings.

The Tigers lengthened their
lead to 3-0 at the outset of the
second quarter and seemed to
be taking command of the
game. But the Generals finally
got on the board with a goal by
attackman Jay Foster with
11:58 left in the half,

John Kemp then scored four
minutes later to put the
Generals only one goal down at
the half.

The third quarter was a see-
saw battle as the Generals had

to play catch-up most of the
time. Mike Schuler scored 30
seconds into the period to tie the
game at 3-all.

Three times in the period
Towson State took the lead by a
goal and three times the
Generals battled back to tie the
game, with two goals coming
from Foster and one from mid-
die Joe Olive to tie the game at
66 at the end of the third
quarter.

Early in the final period,
Towson State went ahead 7-6 on
a goal by attackman Mike
Burke, but Geoff Brent
answered with a goal of his own
only moments later to start a
scoring spree that gave the
Generals the win. With the
scored tied for the fourth time
in the game at 7-7, Foster

scored his fourth goal to put the
Generals in the lead for the first
time.

After’ a quick time out, the
Generals went back on the at-
tack with Scott McLam scoring
on a one- man fast break to give
W&L a two goal lead at 9-7. This
play firmly shifted the momen-
tum to the Generals’ bench.

Two scores by attackman
Chris Kearney solidified the
lead. The first came at 5:30 in
the fourth off a pass from Mike
Pressler and the final score
came with 4:28 left in the game
on an extra-man play, with the
assist going to Rob Staugaitis.

Standouts in the game were
Foster with four goals, Kearney
with two, and Staugiatis, who
contributed six assists while

playing with a broken rib he suf-
fered during practice.

The Generals scored on three
or four extra-man opportunities
while Towson State managed to

“capitalize on only 2 of 6. W&L

also won 17 of 22 face-offs with
John Hooper winning 12 of 13.

Coach Jack Emmer express-
ed satisfaction with his team’s
performance, stressing that,
though the Generals failed to

play well in the first half, the
team came through in the
clutch. Emmer praised the play
of McLam and Olive,
characterizing the latter, as a
‘solid but unsung player.”’

Emmer also said that though
his team is currently ranked
third, it ‘can’t play with the
rankings in mind. We have to
concentrate on the games
ahead.”

Heart Fund Race

Seven members of the

No Jinx Last Saturday

By Bill Whalen

I must confess that before last Saturday’s
lacrosse game, I was a bit skeptical of the W&L’s
success. Afterall, the Generals had won their first
three games and one had to wonder if and when
the roof would fall in.

Well, Saturday’s games seemed to be the
perfect opportunity for all of my doubts and
nightmares to come to life. The Generals were fac-
ing a team that had nothing to lose and everything
to gain from beating W&L — and for a while, it
looked like they damn well were going to.

In case you weren’t there to see, Townson State
gave the Generals the type of game that they did
not want to have, but probably necded. Before run-
ning out of gas sometime in the fourth quarter,
Towson has stayed even with W&L, and were
prepared to pull off one of the bigger upsets of the
young season.

But thanks to a flurry of scores and some deft
clearing and passing, the Generals were able to
escape from what was their toughest game of the
season. More importantly, the game probably
erased any of the smugness which goes with a No.
4 national ranking.

Ask a coach and he’ll tell you. The toughest
game is the one which comes after the high rank-
ing. For some unknown reason, teams play poorly
when the realize just how good they might be.

And, on Saturday, the Generals almost fell vic-
tim to that same curse.

But they didn’t, thanks to the work of two
players who are in the final season of their four-
year stays at this school. If I were in charge of giv-

ing out MVP awards after Saturday’s games, my
two choices would have been Scott McLam and
Jay Foster.

On the field, McLam and Foster are almost the
same type of player. Both go relatively unnoticed
unless they score and both seem dedicated to the
type of team ball which has resulted in their
team’s high position. Against Towson, both were
key reasons why the Generals were able to over-
come their early stagnation. ’

Foster’s presence as a little more noticeable
than McLam’s. The senior attackman scored four
of his team’s 11 goals. And in case you haven’t
noticed, Foster has always been a consistent
scorer, connecting on better than one-third of his
attempts throughout his career.

Scott McLam, on the other hand, is one of those
players who has an anonymous role. McLam plays
what is best called a ‘‘defensive midfielder” role,
which means his job is basically to clear the ball to
someone else who can score. But many of you may
not realize that this guy can run, pass and shoot as
well as anybody else on his team.

On Saturday, McLam was one of the middies in-
strumental in getting the ball into the Generals’
scorers. He did his job so well that he even scored
a goal himself after running two-thirds of the
length of the field and beating the goalie one-on-
one.

The next time you watch the Generals in action
(which will be Sunday, April 20, against Virginia
in what is. looking like a true classic), take a look
at these two players. They might not score as
much as some of their teammates, but they come
through when they’re needed.

Washington & Lee University
administration participated in
the annual Heart Fund Run held
Saturday, March 22, at VMI.

In the 20-29 year old group,
W&L Financial Aid Director
Mike Bartini finished fifth in the
ten kilometer run with a time of
35:52. Paul Kochler and Jeffrey
Robitalle tied for 13th with a
time of 45:09, while Jeffrey
Buntrock finished 18th with a
time of 49:16.

In the 30-39 year old group,

W.L. Sessions placed eighth
with a time of 45:57, edging
Harlan Beckley by only 41
seconds. In the age 40-49 group,
Fred Schwab finished in third
place with a time of 38:31.

Two of Dr. Schwab’s children
also competed in the races. Son
Bryan finished 12th in the mile
run, while daughter Kim was
16th.

The race will be held again at
VMI next year and will be spon-
sored by Col. Louis Hundley.

Bernot All-American

(continued from page 4)

stated W&L head coach Page
Remillard, who accompanied
Mike at the meet. ‘“‘Sometimes
a coach will have a different
view of an athlete’s potentials,
but now, in this case, both coach
and swimmer can see what can
be achieved.”

Concerning the — school
records, Remillard reported

that Bernot is now intent on bet-
tering the marks. “Just as Van
Leer was an outstanding com-
petitor whose marks were
lowered by an eager young
swimmer, so does Mike realize
that one day his records will no
longer stand.

“In the meantime, however,
he’s gonna make it as hard as
he can for someone else to
establish new records.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Shower Chagrins Architect

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Ramblings

Things have been pretty dead around here this
week so we didn’t know what we would comment on in
this space. Even Persiflage couldn’t think of anything
trite to say, so he went down the road last night.

Yesterday was an exceptionally nice day and one of
the editors suggested a ‘‘nice weather”’ editorial, but
others present threatened to resign if we wasted this
space again on that. :

Then someone suggested we warn people again that
they should lock up tight for vacation so, maybe, they
won’t get robbed over break—but you’ve heard all
that before.

One vindictive type said we should make some
snide remarks about how no one seems to know the
origins of the now famous shower, but that would just
be rubbing salt in the wound. (A professor recently
suggested that bidets might be nice bathroom addi-
tions for the female professors. )

Moving on to another topic, has anyone seen two
Burma teak benches lying around? They’re worth
almost $600 and belong to the University. No one
seems to know where they are. We aren’t supposed to
blame the Lexington townies again, are we? (If
found, please return to area in front of the new
library. )

We were tempted to say something about how glad
we are this term is finally over. It’s been a long haul
and it’s ending with the usual flurry of term papers
and final projects. But the last thing you want to read
about are term papers and exams.

Someone else thought it would be a good opportuni-
ty to congratulate the lacrosse team for being ranked
third in the nation and blowing away Tech yesterday
24-3. Now there’s something. It’s too bad the second
half of the schedule is mostly away games—a lot of
road trips. That’s why lacrosse is so big here:
because the lax team is the only chance W&L has to
beat Tech and N.C. State and Virginia. Now you can
feel i: at the lacrosse games—that this is the year. But
we've run out of space. Have a good and well deserv-
ed break.

P.S.—Please, Bob, don’t take away our money. We
won’t say anything else nasty—promise.

Dear Editor:

Please refer to your article
dated March 20, 1980, entitled
“Thoughts on the $1,000
shower’’, giving credit to Dean
Edward C. Atwood for the
shower installed adjacent to his
office.

As planners assisting the
University in renovation of the
McCormick Library into the
School of Business, we were
much chagrined after sear-
ching our files to learn that the
shower had been called for and
installed in the space.

The fact of the matter is that
this facility shares plumbing
pipes with an adjacent janitor’s
closet containing required

plumbing.

The inclusion of the shower
was completely an_ internal
communication planning error
on our part. The additional cost
of the tiled shower was approx-
imately $650 not $1,000.

Anyone can err, Our check for
same has been directed to the
University to cover these costs.

On the subject of Dean At-
wood, during this planning of
the Business School Facility, he
and his faculty employed a
careful and conservative ap-
proach to the school’s needs and
requirements, and made every
effort to provide your student
body with a Sound, long-lasting
and economical facility.

necessitated this measure.

Black
Emphasis Week

Impresses
Turner

Dear Editor:

Recently, I had the pleasure
of being the guest of
Washington & Lee University in
celebration of Black Emphasis
Week. I was impressed by the
concern shown me by Dean
John White and other members
of the administration.

The students, primarily
members of S.A.B.U., showed
genuine interest in my work and
posed intelligent questions. It
was a pleasure to meet fellow
author, Clark Mollenhoff, a
member of the faculty as well
as speak with professors from
various other departments.

I would like to thank Mr.
DeMaria of the journalism
school for his interest and stu-
dent Greg Coy for an intelligent
interview on Cable television.
Student Robert Stephen was ex-
tremely helpful in a personal
way and did much to encourage
my present work in progress.

I found lunch at the Cockpit to
be well-prepared and delicious.

Black Emphasis Week is a
vital part of the total educa-
tional experience for those of us
who live in a multi-ethnic coun-
try. It would be encouraging
and wise for members of the
larger campus community of
different racial backgrounds to
participate in the programs of-
fered during this time. I am
sure they would be weleomed.. -

This restricted admittance
policy will be strictly adhered to
and an advance ticket will be
required for entrance to any
event. We are attempting to
make Easters safer and more
enjoyable for all those concern-
ed. We therefore suggest that
you do not visit the University
during Easters Weekend unless
you have made specific ar-
rangements with a friend at
UVA for a place to stay and ad-
mittance to events.

Easters has a long tradition

hours of effort and planning

beyond his normal duties in

assisting us and others involv-
ed.

hope that you will show your
cooperation.

It is a fallacy to assume that
ideas and programs that stem
from the Black experience are
open or of interest only to Black
people. This is a narrow and un-
productive way of thinking.

Cultural exchange and inter-
racial knowledge can enrich the
life of all who participate in it.
Indeed, such interchange prov-
ed beneficial throughout
history, such as the cultural ex-
change practiced between
China and Japan which resulted
in classical schools of art and
literature.

Finally, while on your
historical campus I became
aware of the controversy aris-
ing from the appearance of
Stokely Carmichael on your
campus.

About that I can only say
diversity in, thought and the... 00...

right to express them is an in-
herent right guaranteed to all
Americans, even to those who
may seem to berate the coun-
try, itself. It is a mark of ex-
treme narrow-mindedness to
assume that only speakers one
agrees with should be allowed
to speak on campus.

A University is the natural
forum for free-thought. Your
marvelous library is full of
material from authors of
diverse opinion; would you
have it otherwise?

Thanks to Reference
Librarian, Ms. Anita Williams
for the grand tour.

I hope that I am fortunate
enough to come to your campus ~
again. I wish you all much suc-
cess.

Flaws In Anti-coeducation Argument

Dear Editor:

In response to the letter dated
Mar. 27, I would like to point out
some basic flaws in Mr.
Mullin’s reasoning. Mr. Mullin
writes:

“If people choose W&L
because of the quality of the
education, choosing it over hun-
dreds of co-educational schools,
might that...be a sign that: A)
The quality of education at
W&L is superior to that of other
schools where women are ad-
mitted (perhaps because we do
not admit women)...”

Mr. Mullin implies that the
quality of education at W&L is
better than at. other schools
because we do not admit
women. It can be inferred then
that women, placed in a learn-
ing environment, negatively af-
fect that environment.

This is strange. I do not See
how women can adversely af-
fect the relative quality of
education, or conversely, how
the removal of women from an
educational system can im-
prove that system.

I can point out reasons why
many W&L students believe
that co-education is bad. Some
say that:

A) Men study harder because
there aren’t any women around
to distract them.

B) Women aren’t as smart as
men, or, at least do not think
like men.

 

April Fool
At W&L

Two W&L professors and two
students were hospitalized for
radiation contamination from
an accident in the physics lab,
or so it was reported on the noon
news Tuesday on campus radio
station WLUR.

Seems two playful freshmen
thought a little April Fools joke
might be in order, but a few
listeners thought they were
serious and made frantic calls
around campus trying to verify
the information.

The journalism department
swept in to handle the problem
and barred both freshmen from
further access to the airwaves
for the rest of the year. These
broadcast people, when will we
ever be able to take them
seriously?

C) The traditions associated
with the present system will be
jeopardized.

The first argument is
popular. Students here see that
they could be distracted from
their work if they could get a
date without having to drive 35
miles. True we at W&L might
be more distracted, but the
ability not to be distracted from
one’s work when there are more
fun things to do is a definite sign
of maturity and and important
skill to leave college with.

Too bad the men at W&L who
see women as nothing but
distractions haven’t had the op-
portunity to develop this
maturity.

The second argument, which
is less popular, but nevertheless
used, is obviously ridiculous
and it ties in with the first. The
fact that these arguments are
considered arguments against
co-education is sad and it
Strangely enough stems from
the fact that we at W&L are not
co-ed.

At W&L today the majority of
the undergraduates’ contact
with women centers around oc-
casional big weekends. As a
result, some of the
undergraduates here tend to
regard women their own age as

“sex objects,:’ as companions
for entertainment only, not as
fellow human beings, as_in-
telligent, as sensitive, as
curious and as courageous as
themselves.

This patently absurd and
degrading view leaves most
W&L undergraduates less well
off than they ought to be or
could be — to cope with and
derive full benefits from the
social and intellectual milieu in
which most of them will pursue
their lives after leaving W&L.

The third argument deals
with tradition which is assumed
omnipotent, but tradition can
lead to stagnation and when it
hinders rational argument or
even denies a different point of
view, it should be abolished.

Another thing that Mr. Mullin
pointed out is that I and Mr.
Clarke should ‘‘bear_ in
mind...that any attempt to
change the basic structure of
the university is going to take
time.’’ To answer this, first of
all, is the basic structure of the
school simply based on the sex
of its students? If so, then this
structure should be rebuilt.

Secondly, just because a
change might not effect us im-
mediately is no reason to deny.
that change. This selfish at-

titude is counterproductive and
does not contain a genuine argu-
ment.

Finally, Mr. Mullin says that
all people who wish to destroy
the school (by simply admitting
girls) should leave. This
primitive love-it-or-leave-it at-
titude ignores the basic argu-
ment. Let’s fact the issue and
consider its relative merits and
not the motivation of the people

who wish to change the system.

A move to co-education will
obviously involve change. Let:s
act in a rational manner and
consider the future. Remember
opposition to change is a defini-
tion of conservatism, but it can
also be a definition of stagna-
tion.

What to know what the
students at the University of
Southwestern Louisiana do for
fun? One student, Rip Howell,
spent 17 and / hours in a tub full
of ketchup.

He claims his feat was a
world record. “I’m totally in-
sane,” he said after the event,
trying to explain his motiva-
tions.

Maybe they call it ‘‘school
spirit” down in Louisiana.

Student Arrested In Dinner Dispute

(continued from page 1)

Shortly after 10 p.m., two
Lexington Police cars arrived
at Nicholson’s apartment. He
was arrested and taken into
custody for booking. One hour
later, Nicholson arranged to
have $200 bail posted and was
released.

Nicholson will face a
preliminary hearing on Tues-
day, Apr. 8, at noon.

The charges against him con-
stitute a ‘‘class one’’ misde-
meanor, carrying a possible one
year jail term.

“This is a serious charge
because it may imply moral
turpitude and would look bad on
my professional record,”’ com-
mented Nicholson. ‘I do not
take this as a joke or a minor
matter.”’

Snyder agreed that the
charge is serious because inn-
keeper laws are strictly enfore-
ed.

“This is a vulnerable
business, so the law protects
innkeepers like myself,” he
said.

He added that on one occa-

EC Hears Reports

(continued from page 1)

The EC also passed a motion
that the subcommittee set up a
series of debates on coeduca-
tion, to be held in the spring.

That motion passed 11-1, Sam
Allen dissenting.

In business earlier in the
night, the EC recommended the
racketball club conform to the
standards set by other club
teams before it approaches the
EC for money.

Bill Towler, a racketball club
member, said the club is com-
posed of six undergraduates
and six faculty members.

They wanted fifty dollars to
cover the entrance fee for a na-
tional tournament on April 20.

After being denied the money,
Towler compared his club to the
squash club and asked what it
had done to deserve student
funds.

EC President Steve Abraham
said the squash club was open to
all members of the community
and advertised for members.

He added the squash club has
a ladder ranking its members.

The motion, “‘if the racketball
club is to request money in the

charge but the judge would not
do so.

Nicholson declined to discuss
his case in detail. He only stated
that the charges are “‘off the
wall.”

“I’ve consulted a local at-
torney and he told me this
would be an open-and-shut case,
so I plan to handle my own
defense,”’ he said.

Nicholson added that he is
‘‘considering other legal alter-
natives,’’ which may include a
civil suit against Ted’s.

him.

He said that although
Nicholson was a_ regular

my people a hard time. Some
waitresses refuse to serve
him.”’

Snyder added that he was
sure that there was nothing

‘‘He told the waitress that the
sausage on his spaghetti was
spoiled. I know that’s not true
because he ate lasagna made
with the same sausage,’’ he
said. ‘‘I cooked that spaghetti
myself and ate some of it
later.”

“If the spaghetti ‘tasted fun-
ny,’ it was probably because he
(Nicholson) smothered it with
hot peppers and_ cheese,”
Snyder added.

Between 15 and 20 percent of
Ted’s business comes from
W&L. Snyder said he does not

business.

Despite their seemingly un-
solvable differences, both
Nicholson and Snyder said they
were “embarrassed” by this
event.

“It was a very humiliating ex-
perience. I didn’t sleep very
well that night,’’ said
Nicholson.

“I wish it had never happen-
ed. I get no pleasure out of it at
all. It didn’t do anybody any
good, but I had to protect my
business,’’ elaborated Snyder.
