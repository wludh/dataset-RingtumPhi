Magazines Cost $4 Apiece

 

Ariel Attacked By EC

Ariel editor Chris Faye
reported Monday night to the
Executive Committee that he
spent approximately two-thirds
of his budget on the first 40-page
edition of the Ariel.

The 400 copies of the literary
magazine, initially estimated to
cost $1400, actually cost $1582.90
to print and averaged $4.00 a
copy.

Many EC members express-
ed their personal displeasure
with the latest edition of Ariel.

‘“‘As a student I would like to
express my disappointment in
the Ariel,’’ said Senior

Representative Jay Blumberg.
“I’m not a literary critic, but

some of these things don’t seem

worthwhile,”’ said Blumberg.

Blumberg criticized Faye’s
budgeting for the magazine.

Senior Law Representative
John Fraser was also displeas-
ed and voiced his opinion, ~

‘Just to say that Jay is not a
minority, I would like to voice
my displeasure,’’ said Fraser.

Fraser also said ‘‘a fairly
large portion of the Ariel was

*trash.”’

“By and large, I would have
to agree with Jay,” was

Fraser’s concluding comment.

Other members of the EC also
voiced their displeasure with
the Ariel, among them Les Cot-
ter, EC Vice President, and Ed-
mund Schenecker, Freshman
Representative, who said some
of the material in the Ariel was
‘‘offensive.””

Discussion on the matter
stopped when Dee Keesler said
“I think this is out of our
realm.”

The EC decided the matter
should first be discussed by the
Publications Board, which
meets tonight at 7:30 in the
Cockpit.

Students On Student-Faculty
Committees Have Little Effect

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
learned Monday night that two
student representatives on joint
student-faculty committees
have little or no effect on their
committees.

Channing Hall, a member of
the Lecturers Committee, told
the EC that his committee has
not met in over a year-and-a-
half, yet has _ presented

speakers under the direction of
John McKenzie Gunn, associate
professor of economics.

Hall told the EC that only
Gunn can call a meeting.

Most EC members stared in
disbelief while Hall gave his
report, but Senior Law
Representative John Fraser
suggested that ‘If you have a
vote, I think there should be
meetings and you should go to

‘Carterization’ Of America

by John Billmyre

President Carter's foreign
policy has been fragmented and
ineffective thus far, possibly
leading to the recent crises in
Afghanistan and Iran, but the
President may turn his foreign
policy around as a result of the
crises, according to NBC cor-
respondent Richard Valeriane.

‘I’m not here to criticize the
President's foreign policy. You

could have invited Andy Young
to do that,’ said Valeriane last
night during the first Contact
program of the year.

Valeriane’s topic was the
“Carterization’” of American
foreign policy.

He is a 16-year veteran of the
Washington press corps and
covered Watergate and the Bay

the meetings.’’ Hall reminded
the EC that the cannot force
meetings but said he would talk
to Gunn.

Stuart Miller and Chris Burn-
ham, members of the Library
Committee, told the EC that
while they offer much informa-
tion during Library Committee
meetings, Maurice Leech Jr.,
the University’s head librarian,
often ‘‘shucks off”’ their sugges-
tions.

Miller told the EC that
Leech’s attitude is, ‘‘we’ve
heard them, (the students on
the committee), now what do
we want to do.”’

One major point of controver-
sy for the committee and the
library staff is the use of the
door on the library’s lower level
four.

Jay Blumberg, Senior Repre-
sentative, asked Burnham why
students should not be able to
use the door and _ said,
“realistically, it’s not difficult
to take a book out of the
library.”

Blumberg was referring to
arguments by some that leav-
ing the door open would allow
people to take books out on the
lower level without checking
them out.

Burnham said he brought up
the idea to head librarian
Leech, but that Leech discarded
the suggestion.

“Leech has said that in-
surance will not cover the door
being unlocked,” said Burn-
ham. He was not sure if Leech
meant the building’s insurance
or insurance on the books.

After hearing about three pro-
posed student motions which
were tabled, Blumberg had
several questions about the
students’ role on the committee.

At one point during Blum-
berg’s questioning of Miller and
Burnham, EC President Steve

Dystrophy Dance Marathon is shown here leading a train of
dancers in last years dance which netted over $12,000.

MD Dance Marathon
Slated For Jan. 25

Students at Washington and
Lee University will try to raise
$15,000 later this month for
muscular dystrophy research
during their second annual 30-
hour dance marathon.

The event, sponsored by
W&L’s Interfraternity Council,
begins at 8 p.m. Jan. 25 in the
university’s Evans Hall. Some
120 dancers have already
registered to participate, ac-
cording to the marathon
chairmen, Jay Blumberg and J.
Hemby.

This Saturday’s basketball
game against Lynchburg will
benefit M.D. Contributions will
be taken at the door and a free
throw contest at halftime will
give away shirts.

Southwest Virginia’s poster
child, Ronda Lee Adkins, will
also be there.

A year ago, when Blumberg
organized W&L’s first Muscular
Dystrophy benefit dance
marathon, he set his goal at
$5,000. But it captured the im-
agination of students and others
beyond anyone’s expectations,
and by the time it was over,
more than $12,000 had been rais-
ed for clinical research and

equipment.
Participants are expected to
secure pledges — a certain

amount to be donated per hour
danced. To take part in the

marathon this year, each
dancer has to start with at least
$45 committed. ‘

The marathon will open with
the music of ‘‘Apaloosa,”’ a
Baltimore rock band which will
play until 10 p.m. “Union
Pacific” will perform from 10
until 2 in the morning, featuring
a program of ‘‘beach music.”

Taped music will be provided
for the energetic dancers dur-
ing the wee hours on Saturday,
from 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 a.m. The
two intervening hours will pro-
vide a rest break for the
dancers.

At 8 a.m., the marathon will
pick full speed again with the
bluegrass sounds of ‘Wild-
grass,”’ which will conduct its
usual two-hour program heard
on WREL radio live from Evans
Hall. WLUR-FM, Washington
and Lee’s_ student-operated
radio station, will take over the
entertainment reins at 10 a.m.,
for a three-hour remote borad-
cast of music hits.

Live bands will play from 1
p.m. on Saturday through the
end of the 30-hour dance, begin-
ning with the 1950s rock-and-roll
sound of loca] favorite ‘‘Dodge
D’Art,”’ frequent visitors to the
W&L Cockpit. Following at 3
p.m. will be another local band,
‘“Albatross,’’ specializing in a

founded at W&L 66 years ago —
during the  university’s
Founders’ Day convocation Fri-
day (Jan. 18).

Among honorary ODK _ in-
itiates will be Edward M.
Korry, former ambassador to
Ethiopia (1963-67) and Chile
(1967-71). Korry, now a writer
and consultant in the field of
foreign affairs, will also be the
principal speaker of the day,
lecturing on the current
hostilities in the Middle East.

Other honorary initiates will

Calif., co-owner of the William
Morris Agency, the world’s
largest talent agency; Daniel C.
Lewis Jr. of West Point, Va.,
vice president in charge of ad-
ministration for the Chesa-
peake Corp.; and Dr. James H.
Sammons of Chicago, IIl., pro-
fessor of medicine and ex-
ecutive vice president of the
American Medical Association.

All four honorary initiates
will attend the ceremony, which
begins at 12:30 p.m. in W&L’s
Evans Hall. Robert E.R.

Huntley, university president, -

will preside over the occasion.

Korry, who graduated from
W&L with a B.A. in 1942, work-
ed for the National Broad-
casting Corp. and as a foreign
correspondent for United Press
before entering the diplomatic
corps. From 1954 to 1962 he was
European editor and assistant
to the president of the Cowles
Magazine and Broadcasting Co.
During his tenure as am-
bassador to Ethiopia, he wrote
the Korry Report on African
Development for President
Johnson. Currently residing in
Stonington, Conn., he teaches at
Connecticut College in addition
to his other activities.

Kamen is a 1949 law graduate
of Washington and Lee, and for
many years has been involved
in the university’s Annual Fund
drives. As co-owner of William
Morris, he has been involved in
arranging talent packages for a
large number of successful film
productions, including ‘Love
Story,’’ The Summer of ’42,”
“The Day of the Jackal,” and
“The Sterile Cuckoo.”’

Lewis was another member

23 South Main Street

of W&L’s undergraduate class
of 1942, and continued his
studies at Harvard, where he
received his M.B.A. doctorate
in commercial science. For a

time, he was also a member of-

the Washington and Lee faculty
in the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics. A
naval officer in World War II,
Lewis has also been active for a
number of years in community
projects. Before joining the
Chesapeake Corp., he was

secretary and treasurer of the

Lynchburg Foundry Co.
Sammons is a 1947 W&L
graduate. After receiving his
M.D. degree from St. Louis
University in 1951, he became
very active in Texas medical
circles. He has been president
of the East Harris County

(Tex.) Medical Association,
chairman of the board of coun-
cilors of the Texas Medical
Association, and chairman of
the board of directors of the
American Medical Political Ac-
tion Committee. For several
years, he was president and
chairman of the Houston
Academy of Medicine. In addi-
tion to his ANA position, he is
professor of family medicine at
Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.

The four honorary ODK in-
itiates will be joined by six law
students and 20 undergraduates
at W&L who have also been
chosen for ‘‘tapping’’ this
Founder’s Day. By tradition,
the names of the on-campus in-
itiates are kept secret until the
ceremony itself.

Former Ambassador

Richard A. (‘Captain Dick’’) Smith

Scholarship Created
To Honor Longtime
Athletic Director

An honor scholarship endow-
ment in memory of the late
Richard A. (Captain Dick’’)
Smith, longtime athletic direc-
tor at Washington and Lee
University, has been created at
W&L through a $25,000 gift from
his son.

Richard W. Smith, a 1941
graduate of Washington and
Lee and a prominent lawyer in
Staunton, established the
scholarship program to
recognize outstanding student
leadership — _ including
character, competitive spirit,
scholarship and _ athletic
achievement.

“Captain Dick,’’ a member of
the Virginia Sports Hall of
Fame, was director of inter-
collegiate athletics at W&L for
23 years, baseball coach for 30,
and basketball coach for five.

More Burglaries
Over Break

by David Greer

Several Washington and Lee
students returned from
Christmas break to find their
farmhouses had been burglar-
ized.

At least five houses had
stereos and other valuables
stolen from them over the
break. One student’s car was
broken into while it was parked
on the campus over break.

Mark Turner found his turn-
table, amplifier and tapes miss-
ing when he returned, but the
thieves left his speakers. In a
farmhouse next door, also oc-
cupied by students, two tape
decks, an amplifier, a chair and
some pictures were stolen.
Again the thieves left speakers
behind as well as some other
equipment.

Two stereos were stolen from
Bruce Moore and _ Tobin
Cassells at their house in the
country. A_ television and
another stereo was not taken.

Richard Schoenfeld and
Marsh Dougherty each lost
stereo equipment from their
house. Here, speakers were
again left behind, as was some
other equipment.

Richard Wallerstein and
Bruce Poole had stereos and
guns stolen from their house.

All of the burglarized houses
are in the county and are
generally isolated from each
other and neighbors. In most
cases liquor and bulky equip-
ment was left behind.

Richard Essex had _photo-
graphic equipment stolen from
his car while it was parked
behind the Graham-Lees dorm-
itory over break.

Sweetbriar student Lori
Faust had clothes valued at
over $1,000 stolen from her car
Sunday night, Jan. 6. The car
was parked below the Gym-
nasium in a Woods Creek park-
ing lot.

 

 

Pub Board
Meeting

The publications Board will
hold a meeting Thursday night
at 7:30 p.m. in the Cockpit. At-
tendance is mandatory.

 

 

he was an outstanding athlete
himself throughout his under-
graduate years — in spite of a
chronic shoulder separation
which ended his chance to play
major league baseball. ‘“‘Cap-
tain Dick’’ died August 15, 1975,
at the age of 86, credited with a
legacy of having helped mold
the character of hundreds of
W&L men. Washington and
Lee’s baseball field is named
Smith Field in his honor.

Income from the new scholar-
ship endowment will be used to
award “Captain Dick’’ Smith
Honor Scholarships to students
with financial need who have
compiled academic and extra-
curricular records of unusual
distinction.

The university said its hope is
that friends of ‘“‘Captain Dick,”
including alumni he influenced,
will choose to honor his memory
by helping increase the size of
the special scholarship endow-
ment. The goal is eventually to
increase the endowment to at
least $50,000.

When “Captain Dick’’ died,
the sports editor of the
Richmond Times-Dispatch,
Chauncey Durden, recalled him
as a “Washington and Lee in-
stitution and a Lexington land-
mark ... a delightful compan-
ion.”” W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley said: ‘‘ ‘Captain
Dick’ Smith has been an institu-
tion at Washington and Lee. It is
from persons like him that this
school has derived its strength
and its character over the cen-
turies. I shall miss him sorely,
as will his many friends, but he
will never be forgotten at
W&L.”

The university said it is
especially fitting that ‘‘Captain
Dick’’ should be memorialized
by an honor scholarship pro-
gram. ‘Captain Dick’’ himself
once recalled that he almost
went to another college because
tuition at Washington and Lee
when he arrived in 1909 was $85,
but his scholarship was for only
$50.
A friend talked him into stay-
ing ‘for another day”’ beforo he
left Lexington. ‘‘Well, they fix-
ed me up with another $50
scholarship,” he reminisced.
“They weren’t supposed to give
but one, but I got two. Then I
had $15 change, and that went
for six months’ rent.”
One Less Nightspot

 

Paramount Inn

by Ed Edge

The Paramount Inn on
Washington Street has closed,
leaving the Washington and Lee
students one less “night spot”
that they may frequent.

Students returned from their
Christmas holidays to find the
restaurant and bar closed.
Thursday night “‘happy hours”’
that the establishment had been
offering the public were no
longer available.

Thursday nights between 10
p.m. and midnight students and
townspeople alike used to crowd
the Paramount Inn to take ad-
vantage of the lower beer
prices, but now there are few
bars for them to pick from.

The Paramount Inn offered
an informal atmosphere that
was attractive to students who
wanted to be in a casual setting.
Every type of attire could be
seen on these Thursday nights—
everything from coats and ties
to ragged jeans. It was a ‘come
as you are”’ type of situation.

With the loss of this place, the
person who is looking for a
place where he may sit, relax
and have a beer now finds his
choices limited.

Other establishments, or
pubs, similar to the Paramount
Inn in Lexington are the White
Column Inn and Central Lunch,
both on Main Street,

The White Column Inn, also
known for its “happy hour”’ on

Thursday nights, offers the
public a place to go for a cheap
beer, but it is not quite as large
or informal a place as was the
Paramount.

The White Column Inn does
give the student a place to go
and have a beer in more of a
“sit down” situation and be
served by waitresses.

The White Column has been a
long-time favorite for many
local people. There are always
the ‘regulars’ to be seen
around the establishment.

These ‘“‘regulars’’, some who
appear to be Washington and
Lee graduates, add to the per-
sonality of the White Column
Inn.

Across the street from the
White Column Inn is Central
Lunch, better known as
“Ducks.”’ .

Central Lunch is an even
smaller place than the Para-
mount or White Column inns. It

In duPont

Closes

is more of a walk-in place where

you can come in, get what you

want, and get out ina hurry.
Owned and run by Mr. and

- Mrs. Duck, the place is fre-

quented by students on a
regular basis.

Central Lunch is a favorite
among a great number of
students and has been for a long
time.

These three gathering places
for the W&L students — Para-
mount Inn, White Column Inn
and Central Lunch — have
given the students a place to go
to relax and get away from the
academic atmosphere of
school. With the closing of one
of these places, choices on
where to go at night are limited
to two.

Perhaps some enterprising
businessman will recognize the
need for another social gather-
ing place and capitalize on that
need.

Photographer’s Prints Still On Exhibit

Michael Miley, who produced
what are believed to be the first
color photographic prints—but
who is best remembered as
‘‘General Lee’s_ photo-
grapher’’—is the subject of a
month-long exhibition at
Washington and Lee beginning
next week.

The exhibit, the fifth in an an-
nual series at W&L devoted to
artists and works of art of im-
portance in the area, opened
Jan. 8 in duPont Gallery. More
than 180 Miley photographs are
on display.

In the first years of the 20th
century, Miley perfected a pro-
cess of printing color photo-
graphs by superimposing
separate single-color images in
each of the primary colors. He
and his son, Henry, patented the
technique in 1902, and in 1905
were awarded a Medal of Merit
by the Franklin Institute.

Miley looked on his own pro-
cess as too time-consuming and
too costly for commercial

development, however, and for
those reasons he ‘‘made no ef-
fort to have it brought into
general use,

His principal success resulted

graphs he took of Robert E. Lee
when Lee was president of
Washington College, now W&L,
between 1865 and Lee’s death in
1870.

Among those pictures was the
famed photo of Lee on his
favorite horse, Traveller, made
in 1868 near Rockbridge Baths.
It became Miley’s best-selling
print and remains perhaps the
most popular Lee picture today.
Last year alone, W&L answered
more than 4,500 requests for
copies of a poster with that pic-
ture on it.

In addition to Miley’s Lee
photographs, the W&L exhibit
includes a large number of
other portrait photographs
Miley took of notable and not-
so-notable figures, visitors to
the area and residents.

Most of the color prints in the
exhibit are of still lifes or paint-

ings, because fixed objects lent.

themselves more easily than
people to the lengthy picture-
taking process Miley used.

In addition to portrait
photography, which comprised
the largest part of Miley’s
business, and his experimental
color photographs, the W&L ex-
hibit has a large number of
landscapes, which Miley took

largely because he was
fascinated by unusual cloud and
sunlight effects.

Every photograph in the ex-
hibition is a print actually made
by Miley or his son, who
became a partner in 1895.

Miley was born in 1842 in
Rockingham County, but grew
up in Rockbridge, near Fair-
field. After Civil War service
with the Confederate army, he
began his career in _photo-
graphy in Staunton, but soon

moved to Lexington. Although
he suffered from ‘‘infirmities”’
for the last three years of his
life, he continued to take an ac-
tive part in the business, which
by then was operated by his son,
until his death on May 23, 1918.

“Michael Miley: American
Photographer and Pioneer in
Color’’ will continue in duPont
Gallery through Feb. 1. The
gallery is open weekdays from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m., and there is no
admission charge.

Youth Charged In

A young Rockbridge County
man was arrested by Lexington

and charged with 10 counts of
breaking and entering, eight
counts of grand larceny, and
three counts of petty larceny.

Among the other charges Ed-
ward Lee Aldrige, 18, of Rt.4,

Subcommittees Report
Problems To EC

(continued from page 1)

Abraham told Blumberg that
his best chance of having ques-
tions answered might be ‘‘to
take the matter up with Mr.
Leech personally.”’

“I wonder if it’s even worth
the EC’s time or the Library
Committee’s time,’’ said
Blumberg in
Abraham’s suggestion.

Vandalism is.a major pro-
blem according to the commit-
tee. Burnham reported that
over 3,500 volumes are missing.

He also said the library is
regularly defaced and told the
EC about an incident in which a
freshman cut an assignment out
of a book and returned the book.

But most of the vandalism
goes unnoticed until it’s too late,
said the committee.

‘*T don’t know how to stop peo-
ple from doing things if you
don’t catch them,” said Burn-
ham.

‘“‘Maybe it’s time to rebrief
the freshmen,” said Burnham,
in response to a question about
who the main offenders may be.

The Library Committee, did
have some encouraging news.

Members on the committee
are- checking on the possibility
of obtaining a computer to per-
form duties in finding volumes
available at other libraries.

Robert Neely, also a member
of the Library Committee,
reported the committee is going
to VMI to see its computer and

 

response to

observe its operation.

A computer would eliminate
calling other libraries and
writing letters when searching
for books not in the new library.

The Committee announced
that a formal dedication of the
library will be held on May 23
and will feature three speakers
who have not yet been selected.

The EC also heard reports
from other committees that in-
dicate students have been suc-
cessful in their endeavors to
voice opinions and get results.

Tony Carli, a member of the
Faculty Executive Committee,
said, ‘‘The faculty is responsive
to student suggestions.”’

‘“‘We’ve had no conflicts and
we usually agree with the facul-
ty or they agree with us,” said
Carli.

But Senior Representative
Dee Keesler had a question
about the effectiveness of
students on the committee.

“Is the lack of conflict
healthy?’’, asked Keesler.

Les Cotter, Executive Com-
mittee Vice President, said the
lack of conflict was not bad.

“It’s a good give and take
situation where each case is
decided on its individual
merits,’’ said Cotter.

The Faculty EC decides
whether a student can take an
under or overloaded schedule.

Junior Representative Bruce
Poole asked Carli why school
starts and ends so late.

“It’s kind of a tradition, we
never start before Labor Day,”
said Carli.

But Les Cotter added, ‘‘We
start so late because of the
trimester system.”’ He explain-
ed ‘‘That is the price we have to
pay for the trimester.”’

Carli told the EC that the
Faculty EC only makes recom-
mendations about the schedule.
The University Council has a
greater say about the schedule
than the Faculty EC and the
faculty has the final word on the
schedule.

The EC also passed a motion
after it was told by John
Hamilton, The Calyx business
manager, that a graduate had
bought materials tax free,
under the university’s name,
and then repaid The Calyx.

Bob Willis, who said he was
greatly upset by the graduate’s
use of the tax-free status said,
‘‘T want to make a proposal that
this does not happen again.”’

Blumberg reprimanded
Hamilton, who did not find out
about the purchase until after it
had been made.

“It seems this is the second
time this has happened,” said
Blumberg.

He proposed, ‘I would recom-
mend that private purchasing
under the school’s tax-free
status not be allowed.”’

The vote passed 11-0, with one
member, Bruce Poole, absent.
Poole left the meeting early.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee also reported on its ac-
tions during the past few
months.

The Committee met three
times, once for a _ regular
meeting, once at the Presi-
dent’s request and once at the
request of two basketball

players who were suspended
from the varsity squad.

Tom Wall, a member of the
University Athletic Committee,
told the EC, ‘‘President Huntley
just told us to meet and discuss
the basketball players, he did
not recommend what’ action
should be taken.”’

Wall explained that since all
W&L students were found to be
equally guilty, they were all
given the same penalty.

The nine .athletes involved
will not be allowed to represent
W&L in any athletic contest for

 

one calendar year.

The penalty also applies to
the two assistants to the basket-
ball team.

_ And the W&L graduate who
was coaching will not be allow-
ed tocoach at W&L again.

Jack Norberg, also of the
University Athletic Committee,
said the basketball players felt
they had been judged too harsh-
ly and wanted their case to be
appealed.

The University Athletic Com-
mittee did not hear the case

again. ;

Dr. Merchant Named
New Advisor To IFC

The Washington and Lee
Inter-fraternity Council Tues-
day elected John Holt Merchant
Jr., assistant history professor,
as its faculty adviser.

Merchant was one of the four
faculty members considered for
the position, a position that the
IFC felt was needed in light of
faculty-fraternity strife which
came toa head last year.

Syd Farrar, IFC president,
said that the role of the faculty
adviser would be to attend IFC
meetings and help the IFC im-
prove the image of fraternities
in the faculty’s eyes. Also, Far-
rar said the adviser could give
the IFC a taste of faculty reac-
tion to its proposals before they
became policy. .

In other business, IFC
weekend has tentatively been
planned for the weekend of
March 22. Ab Boxley, social
chairman, suggested that. a

Also, Boxley said the IFC has
plenty of money to spend and
might work towards a party at

two bands after the home

Finally, the IFC passed a
recommendation that each

Farrar called a meeting of

Wednesday at 7:00. Besides
minor intra-fraternity disputes,
the board will investigate the
funding of several Wednesday
night parties that fraternities
had last week.

Last Week

City Charges Student Body $385

For Damage To Police Car

by John Billmyre

The Executive Committee
tabled action on restitution to
the city of Lexington for
damages done to a police car
and defined the role of ad hoc
members to EC subcommittees
during a short meeting last
week.

EC President Steve Abraham
read a letter to the EC which
Chief of Police James A. Kirby
sent to the university.

Dean of Students Louis G.
John received the letter and
gave it to the EC because “‘it in-
volved a student-matter.”’

Kirby’s letter charged that
Washington and Lee students
were responsible for $385 worth
of damage done to a police
cruiser during the anti-Iranian
rally before the Christmas
break.

Abraham suggested that the
committee not act on the matter
until it had information about
the department’s insurance on
the car. ;

‘‘We want to see if the city’s

‘insurance will pay for the
damage,” said Abraham.

- Junior Representative Bruce
Poole agreed with Abraham,
but Senior Law Representative
John Fraser said a greater
question had to be answered.

Fraser condemned W&L stu-
dent’s behavior on the night of
the rally, but the students’
behavior was not really the
question.

“The students showed
juvenile behavior to start with,
but I don’t want to start a prece-
dent where everytime a W&L
student goes downtown and
raises hell the University has to
pay for it,”’ said Fraser.

Fraser said the University
cannot be responsible for the

actions of all of its students and
asked the committee, “Are we
going to pay for the boxwoods?”’
Abraham stopped discussion
before the boxwoods were dis-
cussed at length and the EC
voted unanimously to table the
matter until it has more in-
formation about the incident.

The role of ad hoc members to
EC subcommittees was also
defined after several minutes of
debate.

“It has come to my attention
that some EC members have
been voting on their ad hoc com-
mittees,’’ said Abraham.

Senior academic represen-
tative Jay Blumberg criticized
that practice.

“It is not fair, as in the case of

Student Control, for an ad hoc °

member to vote on an elected
board,” said Blumberg.

Bruce Poole, who was a mem-
ber of the Student Control Com-
mittee last year and is an ad hoc
member this year agreed with
Blumberg but said that he has
voted on Student Control mat-
ters this year, a practice he said
he has stopped.

Dee Keesler, the second
senior representative, explain-
ed his view on the role of the ad
hoc member.

“I feel it is our duty to express
the EC point of view to the sub-
committees,”’ said Keesler.

Following discussion, Blum-
berg proposed that “EC mem-
bers act in an advisory capacity
and not vote in any decision.”’
The motion passed unanimous-
ly.
The EC also heard reports
from its subcommittees.

Members of the Student Ac-
tivities Board reported that
they are staying within their

budget, though they could not
file a complete budget since all
bills had not been received.

In response to a question from
Dee Keesler, SAB member
Danny Ruskin said attendance
at meetings has been good.

The University Center Com-
mittee, which is subordinate to
the SAB, reported that it has
two-thirds of its budget to spend
during the remainder of the
year.

Contact announced its
schedule for January and

February. The schedule in-

cludes three speakers: Richard
Valerini, a State Department
Correspondent with NBC news,
Gen. William Westmoreland,
and Robert Evans,

Blumberg and Keesler asked
Contact Co-chairman Scott Car-
doza if the platform for the
speakers could be more varied.

Cardoza explained that he is

working for a program that will -

have people attend the Contact
program on a regular basis.

Cardoza also said that Con-
tact has saved $300 this year by
using a different type of postal
permit than has been used in
the past.

Correspondent Is Grim
On Soviet Intentions

Washington correspondent
Charles Corddry painted a dim
picture of the Soviet Union’s
policies in the 1980’s and their
relationship to the United States
Monday evening in Lee Chapel.

Corddry, a Washington mili-

tary affairs correspondent for
the Baltimore Sun addressed
the audience with his talk
“Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan—
There Goes the Whole
Neighborhood.”’

In the course of his discus-
sion, Corddry speculated as to

| the Soviet Union’s intentions in

Afghanistan. The reason for the
invasion, Corddry said, ‘‘could
lay in the fact that the Soviet
Union does not wish any
political instability on its
borders, or possibly the Soviets
have long range plans.”’
Corddry explained the Soviets
must have felt that American
opinion was not important, par-
ticularly in light of the Senate’s
failure to ratify SALT II and the

recent buildup of NATO defense
forces.

With Soviet influence already
present in North Africa, Cord-
dry expressed concern over a
possible Soviet plan to take over
the Strait of Hormuz, in the Per-
sian Gulf. With 60 percent of the
world’s oil traveling through
the Strait, a Soviet takeover of
that area would be strongly felt.

In addition to outlining what
he viewed to be the aims of the
Soviets in the mid-East, Cord-
dry came to the aid of the
Carter Administration by say-
ing that they, ‘‘had been taking
a bum rap on defense.”’ Corddry
explained that even though
most people equate Carter and
defense with the cancellation of
the B-1 bomber and the neutron
bomb, the President recognized
a dangerous defensive situation
when he took office.

Corddry pointed out that
Carter has made strong moves

Opera On WLUR

WLUR-FM’s broadcasts of
Saturday matinee Metropolitan
Opera performances will con-
tinue this month with master-
pieces by Verdi, Puccini and
Beethoven. All programs may
be head on the Washington and
Lee University radio station at
91.5 on the dial.

Verdi’s popular three-act
opera ‘‘Rigoletto,’’ scheduled
for broadcast this Saturday
(Jan. 19) beginning at 1:30
p.m., will open the series. Tell-
ing the story of the hunchback-
ed buffoon Rigoletto, his
beautiful daughter Gilda, and
her death at the hands of the
evil Duke of Mantua and his
comrades, the opera was one of
Verdi’s first important suc-
cesses. With “La Traviata” and
“Tl Trovatore,” it forms part of
the so-called ‘‘golden trilogy”’ of
masterpieces that had their
premier performances during a
hectic 18-month period between
1851 and 1853.

Singing principal roles will be
soprano Gail Robinson as
Gilda; baritone Sherrill Milnes
in the title role; tenor Carlo Bini
as the Duke; mezzo-soprano
Isola Jones as Maddalena; and
bass Jerome Hines as
Sparafucile. David Stivender
will conduct.

During the first intermission,
musicologist Boris Goldovsky
will present a musical and
dramatic analysis of ‘‘Rigolet-
to’’ in “Opera News On the
Air,”’ and a panel of opera ex-
perts will face quizmaster Ed-
ward Downes during the second
intermission for another round
of Texaco’s Opera Quiz.

The following Saturday (Jan.
26) WLUR will broadcast Puc-
cini’s “‘Tosca’’ beginning at 2
p.m. First heard in 1900,
“Tosca’’ remains a triumph of
‘‘verismo’’ opera — a form that
deals with brutal passions in an
utterly realistic fashion.

Soprano Montserrat Caballe
will sing the role of Floria
Tosca, with tenor Giuseppe
Giacomini as her lover, the
painter Mario Cavaradossi.
Cornell MacNeil, a familiar
face at the Met for decades in
roles from Tonio in ‘‘Pagliacci”’
to Trinity Moses in this year’s
‘‘Mahagonny,’’ will be heard as
the villanious Baron Scarpia.

That performance will be
followed on Feb. 2. by
Beethoven’s only opera,
‘Fidelio,”’ scheduled to start at
2 p.m. A high-minded version of
the familiar ‘‘rescue opera’’ so
popular in the early 19th cen-
tury, ‘Fidelio’ deals with ex-
alted themes such as_ the
celebration of married love and

the triumph of freedom over

tyranny. It is perhaps best
known for the four overtures co
osed by Beethoven to introduce
it to eager audiences.

Verdi’s ‘‘Otello”’ will be heard
the following Saturday, Feb. 9,
also at 2 p.m. Composed after 16
years of retirement by Verdi,
“Otello” opened to madly en-
thusiastic audiences in 1887 and
has retained its. pre-eminent
position ever since. This lyrical
version of Shakespeare’s
tragedy of marital distrust and
murder was_ broadcasted
earlier this year, as the season
opener for PBS _ television’s
‘‘Live From the Met” series.

Videodiscs: Music’s Newest Wave

by Mark Kinniburgh

The advent of the 80’s promises a new decade of
musical advances, ranging from the new digital
mode of recording master tapes to videodisc
jukebox. One company that is leading the charge
into the new technical branches of music
reproduction is Paradise Records from Burbank,
California. Through their most illustrious artist,
Leon Russell, Paradise has the chance to test two
40-track recording studios, (a far cry from the 4
and 8 track studios of the Beatles and Rolling
Stones a few years back), audio-mobile units
capable of remote recording and mixing, and
television set-ups to record an artist on a video
cassette.

The relationship between Leon Russell and
Paradise Records unites two innovators with
great results. Leon Russell has been with Jerry
Lee Lewis, playing piano and arranging new
music.

His talent developed in early rock and blues
roots, as he did most of the Spector Records pro-
ductions of the Crystals and Rovettes, plus the
Righteous Brothers sessions. He was the pianist
for the Byrds classic ‘Mr. Tamborine Man”
recording and Ike and Tina Turner’s ‘‘River Deep,
Mountain High.”

After an experimental interlude with Marc Ben-
no, Russell contributed to Delaney and Bonnie’s
first album and worked with Joe Cocker, for whom
he wrote “Delta Lady.’’ Russell may have gained
his greatest fame for his song writing, with such
hits as ‘“‘Superstar”’ (recorded by the Carpenters)
and ‘“‘This Masquerade’’ (George Benson) and his
own “Lady Blue.”’ Currently, Russell has his
latest album ‘Life and Love” doing well in most
major radio markets.

Leon Russell is a very worthy candidate for the
many developments in recorded musical per-
formances, and he has invented and implemented
many of’ the experimental techniques of audio-

visual reproduction coming to light today. -

Especially with the new video disc concept which
entails using a highly advanced recording studio
in conjunction with a TV set-up and recording that
entire project on a video cassette which is used as
promotion or home entertainment. The latter, now
more than ever, has been the focus of a rather
large marketing push involving a ‘‘jukebox”’
mechanism whereby a patron at a bar or other
establishment could deposit his quarter and see
and hear someone like Todd Rundgren or Blondie
in concert.

In tests of this experiment,

Movie Review

 

Catfish Hodge

 

Dash Doesn't Like ‘Yanks’

Directed by John Schlesinger

Written by Colin Welland and Walter Bernstein
With Rich Gere, Vanessa Redgrave, Will Devane,
and Lisa Eichman

Spontaneous me is at work! Ah, what fun to be
an anglophobe reviewing an Anglaphilic movie!
What fun to launch into those inbred, syphilitic
sheep-buggers (with their decayed complexions)!
But, oh yes, the movie.

Here we have a trite melodrama, in the vein of
Summer of ‘42, trying to cash-in on all the
nostalgia we all must have for a better time when
things were cheap, especially human life. Our
story concerns three romances between British
lasses and our wholesome American boys who’ve
come to save their two-bit, fourth floor, cold-water
walk-up of an island while their own whimpy
manhood is off defending their Imperialistic col-
onies in Africa and Burma.

Romance number one is a fun romance.
Rachael Roberts, a conductor on an “omnibus,”
meets Chic Vennera, his unit’s token Italian, on
her bus. They go to the movies, fall in love, get
married, and say goodbye in a train station in that
order, She’s sultry, he’s easygoing, and that’s
that.

Rich Gere meets Lisa Eichman and all is not so
simple, Lisa it seems is at first unwilling to go out
with curly haired Rich because she has a fiance
fighting in Burma (and her family hates
‘“‘Yanks’’), But, on a companionate basis, they do
agree to go out. Her ‘lad’, however, is killed in
Burma and the predictable Summer of ‘42 things
tug on all your heartstrings in a vain attempt to

false sentiment cheaply earned. Oh, and her mom
dies too.

Will Devane, one of the ugliest actors to be work-
ing now, is having an affair with Vanessa
Redgrave, here playing an aristocratic navy of-
ficer’s wife (shame on you, Vanessa! What would
Arafat say?). Here the complications are many;
they are both married, her young son dislikes be-
ing buggered by the other sadistic waifs at his
boarding school (he’s not sporting!) and calls
home at all hours crying into the phone! Devane
has trouble getting passes, and she feels dirty
about the whole thing, It’s nice to know that
Devane, however, is an officer, so it’s not like
she’s being a tramp and forgetting her inbreeding.

Oh, and how those Limeys dislike us! You would
think that they would appreciate our bailing out
their exploitive mercantilist empire from a
menace that they, to a large part, had created, but
nooo! They seem to resent our presence and freely
pour urine on our boys in uniform! Gad, if only the
alternative to being allied with them hadn’t been
so wholly repugnant!

Ah, but all that nostalgia! This is a rather
faithful movie when it comes to portraying life in a
small British town in the 1940’s, and this is the
movie’s only strength. Of course, there are the
cliche’ genre movie things: a race riot ensuing
when a black soldier dances with a British girl and
a George Wallace look-alike intervenes, those cute
elfish Limey boys beating up on each other if
they’re lucky enough to go to prep school, bar-
racks life (the man’s life) etc., etc., and so on. Not
on par with most films of the genre.

Fassbinder’s ‘Fox

and His Friends’

by Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present its first film
of the winter season, Rainer
Werner Fassbinder’s Fox and
His Friends (also known as
Fist-Right of Freedom), on Fri-
day and Saturday, in Classroom
‘‘A”’ of Lewis Hall, free of
charge. All members of the
campus and community are
cordially invited to attend.

The director of Fox and His
Friends (Germany, 1975), is one
of the two best-known and most
important film makers in the
West German film renaissance
of the past decade. Fass-
binder’s most recent. film, The
Marriage of Maria Braun, is
perhaps the most impressive
new film now playing in New
York. The other director is
Werner Herzog, who made the
last film we showed, The
Mystery of Kaspar Hauser. The
two directors create radically
different worlds.

While Herzog is interested in
transcendental experience and
metaphors of flight, Fassbinder
is a cinematic naturalist, with
some of the melodrama and all
of the power that term implies.

Herzog shows man escaping the
limits ordinarily associated
with social life and the human
condition; Fassbinder explores
the power of society, cir-
cumstance, and_ personality
itself to restrain and even
deform individual aspiration.

Fox is the story of a lower-
class carnival entertainer,
played by Fassbinder himself,
who wins the lottery and falls in
love with a man from the upper
classes. He enters a world of
money and new friends in which
he is ultimately stripped of
everything he owns and is.
Gauche, sloppy and educated,
he hopes that love will turn him
from an ugly duckling into a
swan, but he is finally left to die
in utter anonymity in the Ger-
man metro.

Fassbinder’s movie is a study
of outsiders caught in a society
which places immense value on
social legitimacy and ap-
pearances. As a homosexual
and a member of the lower
classes, Fox is the supreme out-
sider, although even the
wealthy gay world into which he

From the Pressbox

Of Stupor Bowls

by Bill Whalen

Come Jan. 21, I might be the happiest person alive.
The 21st is the day after the Super Bowl.

Here is my problem. My roommate is a Pittsburgh
Steelers fan, and since the beginning of the season,
almost four and a half months ago, all I have heard
about are the ‘‘Super”’ Steelers. Now I have nothing
personal against the city of Pittsburgh and I even
think Terry Bradshaw can spell ‘‘cat’’, but enough is
enough. Let’s just play the damn game and end all the
talk of how great the Steelers are.

This is not to say that the Steelers are not the best
team in football today. They are — and Super Bowl
XIV should prove this. The Los Angeles Rams are 10-
point underdogs. That amounts to a touchdown and a
field goal. But this is the key question: Can the Rams
score a touchdown and a field goal against the ‘‘Stee!
Curtain’? The answer: More than likely, but after the
game is out of hand — like 28-0 Pittsburgh.

Let’s face it, some things in life are simply unat-
tainable. No one will ever figure a way to beat the
Four-Corners offense; I will never get a date with
Cheryl Tiegs and the Los Angeles Rams will never be
the best team in pro football. The Rams have always
struck me as being a bunch of losers. For one, they
play in the worst diversion of the weaker conference.
The Rams also show as much emotion as Duke, the
semi-comatose houndog of ‘“‘The Beverly Hillbillies”’
fame.

Of course, it is not totally unlikely that the Rams
will lose this Sunday. But considering how both teams
match up on offense and defense, the coaching
abilities of Ray Malavasi and Chuck Noll and the way
the Rams played in the NFC Championship, it should
be a laughter for the Steelers.

The number ‘‘3”’ will play a big part in this game,
the Steelers winning for the third time in four years
by a score of 33-13.

And College Capers

On a more serious note, there seems to be some
type of cancer which is spreading through all types
and levels of college sports. It all started in the fall
with the antics of Frank Kush, the former football
coach at Arizona State. Only recently, the disease
spread to next-door neighbor New Mexico State,
where the transcripts of several basketball players
were found to have been doctored.

Now there is a problem in the ACC Heartland —
Tobacco Road. The issue at hand is how N.C. State
player Clyde ‘‘the Glide” Austin has managed to ob-
tain an M.G. and a Cadillac. But down the road at
Chapel Hill, there is the news that Mike Okoren and
Dave Colescott received brand-new Hondas last year.
Sounds like something is rotten in the state of
Carolina.

In 1980, the NCAA appears to be at the crossroads in
the battle against bribes and kickbacks. But are the
players at fault when they take cars from greedy
alumni or sell tickets to over-anxious fans?

No.

The original fault lies with the administrators who
have pushed collegiate athletics into its current state
of near-professionalism. When collegiate sports reach
this level, no one is a winner. Athletes may be
suspended or dismissed for being involved, schools
can be placed on probation and lives are ruined in the
process. And when the players, coaches and schools
are penalized, the fans themselves become the
ultimate victims.

 

 

 

The Generals in action in last weekend’s basketball tournament held at Washington and Lee.

Generals Lose To H-SC;
Record Now Below .500

Second-Half Drought Leads To 62-58 Loss

by Bill Whalen and Dale Park

It certainly is funny how the
shoe can be on the other foot at
times. Take Tuesday night’s
basketball game at Hampden-
Sydney, for example. The
Generals, who are gaining fame
around the O.D.A.C as_ the
‘‘Boxwood Five’’, found
themselves not to be the only
“‘bush’’ team.

That honor and many more go
to the Tigers and their ignorant,
classless supporters who have
the nerve to call themselves

basketball fans. Waving bran- -

ches and cheering ‘‘B-U-S-H’’,
the Sydney students seemed to
be more preoccupied with their
antics than their team’s per-
formance.

Nonetheless, the Generals
came out on the short end of a
62-58 decision. The loss, the
Generals’ second in a row, drop-
ped the team’s record to 1-1 in
conference play and 5-6 overall.

‘My players showed courage
and guts,’’ said Coach Verne
Canfield, ‘‘and I’m extremely
pleased with that.’”” What must
have especially pleased Can-
field was the fact that his young
squad (five of the eight players
who participated for W&L were
either freshmen or  sopho-
mores) seemed to handle the
pressure that accompanies an
important road game.

Led by the outside bombing of
Drew Payne, H-SC jumped to
an early 14-8 lead. But the
Generals stayed close thanks to
strong inside play by Rob
Smitherman and R.J. Scaggs,
and a tip-in by Brian Hanson
knotted the score at 20-all.

“We played well enough to
win,” commented Canfield,
“and I can honestly say that we
would not have done anything
differently.’’ Both teams traded
the lead four times in the last
two minutes of the period.
Another tip-in by Hanson, this
time at the buzzer, gave the
Generals a 34-33 lead going into
the lockerroom.

At the start of the second half,
it appeared to be all W&L. Clark
New scored six of the team’s
first eight and eight of his
team’s first 14 as the Generals
moved to a 50-43 lead with 13:23
left in the game.

It proved to be a lead they
Could not handle.

W&L’s 2-1-2 zone defense was
also taking its effect on the
Tigers’ game plan. The zone
was effective in keeping
Sydney’s Ed Owens off the
boards. The man who usually
burns the Generals for 20 re-
bounds only collected 12 on the
night.

But the Generals could not
Stay in front due to some timely
shooting by Bill Shelly. Shelly
connected on three 25-footers to
pull his team to within one
point, 54-53, with 6:13 remain-
ing.

After the Generals could not
score on three attempts, the
Tigers put together a three-
point play to go ahead for good
with only 5:30 to go. Sydney’s
comeback was also helped by
the Generals’ inability to score
for over three minutes.

By the time Tom Jeffries
scored two of his- team-high 12
points, there was only 3:13 left

and H-SC was ahead by four.
Neither team was then able to
score until only 0:29 remained
in the game. The Generals’ of-
fense, which had been master-
ful in building second-half leads
of seven and five points, could
muster only eight points in the
final 13 minutes.

Another W&L miss gave the
Tigers the ball and Jeff Kroll
sank both ends of a one-and-one
opportunity to seal the game at
60-56. Jeffries hit from the top of
the key with nine seconds left,
but Kroll hit two more free
throws with seven seconds left
to. end the scoring at 62-58,
H-SC.

Though the loss dropped the
Generals below .500 for the first
time this season, Canfield was
not about to admit any panic.
“We will use this game as a
foundations for others’’, said
the coach. “If we can build a
strong bench, we should do 0.K.
for the rest of the season.”’

Surprisingly, Canfield was
not too bothered by the hecklers
who threw branches at the
Generals throughout the game
amd placed some pieces of
shrubbery on the W&L bench
during halftime. ‘‘When I’m on
the court, I don’t let them
bother me,”’ said the coach. “I
concentrate on coaching.”’

With the threat of more
hecklers awaiting them on the
campuses of Lynchburg and
Roanoke, for example, at least
the Generals know what the ex-
perience is like.

Chalk this one up to ex-
perience, ;
Cagers Bow In Finals
Of W&L aicone

by Dale Park

“We're still working to get
our players adjusted to the new
starting line-up and to the new
systems on offense . and
defense.’’ So says W&L Head
Basketball Coach Verne Can-
field after his Generals split
their two games in last
weekend’s W&L_ Invitational
Basketball Tournament.

Friday night’s game, which
pitted W&L against York Col-
lege, gave General fans their
first look at a new starting five
or “‘blues” team.

Remaining from the old start-
ing unit were juniors Rob
Smitherman and R.J. Scaggs
and senior Tom Jeffries. The
new faces both Friday and

Saturday night for the Generals -

were sophomore George Spears
and freshman Brian Hansen.

Against York, W&L concen-
trated on patient ball handling
and a widespread offense that
keyed on looking for the good
shot.

The Generals raced to a quick
32-19 halftime lead behind the
good playmaking and passing of
Spears at guard. Spears’ 15
points on the night helped fill
the greatest void in the
Generals’ offense — the lack of
an experienced, playmaking
guard.

Jeffries, a forward, was the
big offensive weapon for W&L
— scoring 17 points and grabb-
ing seven rebounds. Yet ‘‘T.J.”’

has been equally important by ©

providing leadership and ex-
perience to a team during a
period of readjustment.

Smitherman, although
hampered with a leg injury,
proved tough defensively and
poured in 10 points to aid the of-
fensive effort. The 6’7”’ center
\ also allowed only seven total
points to be scored by the two
York centers he faced ‘that
evening.

Both Hansen (forward) and
Scaggs (guard) added five
points each to round out a
starting-five shooting average
of 45 percent from the field and
- 52 points total.

Wrestling Team Returns

by Chris Sisto

Since returning to school
from the holiday break the var-
sity wrestling team has lost two
dual meets and extended their
record to 1-4.

The losses came at the hands
of .Campbell College (32-18),
and Duke University (50-3).
Against Campbell, Captain Ray
Gross, sophomore Mike McFad-
den, and senior Ed Rogers were
the individual winners for the
Generals. They all won by
points. In the Duke matchup on-
ly Gross was a winner, also by
points.

Head coach Gary Franke is
somewhat disappointed by the
early season play of his team.
‘“‘We have not fielded the best
possible team yet,’’ Franke
said. He placed some of the
blame on injuries to Rodgers,
Mike Deighan, and freshman
Bill Hogan. Franke also said he
felt that some of the younger
players have come around

 

pre

 

Patterson, ‘“‘T’’ scored 10
points, including several key
baskets down the stretch. In ad-
dition, Patterson grabbed seven
rebounds and had _ several
assists that guaranteed the
Generals’s 65-55 victory.

Against York, the Generals
played a tough, primarily man-
to-man defense and rarely
allowed the Spartans more than
one shot on offense. W&L faced
a much quicker team in Ogle-
thorpe in Saturday night’s
championship game, however.

Several positive factors were
evident in the Generals’ 70-55
loss.

Scaggs scored four points and
grabbed four rebounds, while
Hansen had six points and two
rebounds, close to the equiva-
lent of their previous night’s
totals.

Jeffries continued to play in-
spired basketball, scoring 16
points and hauling in eight re-
bounds.

Smitherman, as well, increas-
ed his offensive output, shooting
7-for-13 for 14 points and nine re-
bounds. In the opening minutes
of the game Smitherman block-

slower than he expected. This
season there are four freshmen

was sophomore forward Travis

ed three shots, and, like the en-
tire team, played solid defense
and patient offense, enabling
the Generals to take a 31-29
halftime lead.

Yet the negative factors that
cost the Generals a poor second
half and the game become im-

portant as W&L moves into the
vital part of its O.D.A.C.
season.

Spears’ output as guard drop-
ped to four points total for the
night and the team shot a
dismal 38 percent from the field
in the second half. In addition,
an offense, which had been look-
ing for the good shot, seemed to
grow restless and force the ball
up.

Some consolation was given
by sophomore guard Clark
New’s nine points off the bench.
Yet New’s performance was not
enough to offset the poor overall
shooting of the team.

Experience and patience are
the key words as the Generals
prepare to face their rivals in
ODAC. “We’re short on depth,
especially at guard,” said Can-
field, ‘‘and it’s taking time to
develop some.”’

“But time is something we
don’t have much of at this point
in the season.”’

Skiing Report:

 

ocal Resorts Lack

(2m Necessary Snowfall

The ski season has started rather slowly this year, with milder
than normal temperatures delaying the planned openings of almost
all Eastern ski areas. The exception is at Killington in Vermont,
which had its annual publicity stunt with its Oct. 9 opening of two
slopes, earlier than any other ski resort in the nation with the ex-
ception of the year-round resort on Mount Hood. The skiing in the
East until the Christmas-New Year’s holidays was practically non-
existent, though, with ski areas such as Killington and Stowe open-
ing about 15 percent of their skiable terrain.

The best skiing in the East has been at nearby Srowshoe, West

_ Virginia, where they have been operating with extremely favorable

weather conditions since the first day of their season on Nov. 24. In
addition to the excellent snow condition at Snowshoe, there are also
to be found some of the best trails in the east, with Snowshoe’s best
being Cup Run, which is about one and one-fourth miles long with
excellent mogul runs.

Sugar Mountain in North Carolina was not able to ski above its
half-way point until last weekend and the large crowds that have
descended there have made it practically impossible to keep a good
snow surface,

In contrast, Beech Mountain, located only about seven miles
from Sugar, has been skiing from the top of the mountain for over a
month, with lift lines of less than 30 minutes, compared to Sugar’s
lines of over one hour on the weekends. The recent snowfalls have
given Beech, which has the highest skiing east of the Rockies, an
excellent base on which to made snow, which is very important
since snow making is the lifeblood of Eastern skiing.

Two areas close to Lexington that attract many W&L students
are Massanutten and Wintergreen. Massanutten has the most ver-
tical of any area in Virginia when it opened on Dec. 1. Massanutten
used to be the destination for W&L students enrolled in the skiing
P.E. class, but this year the P.E. skiers will travel to Wintergreen,
which has less vertical, but the same degree of challenge as
Massanutten. In addition, Wintergreen cut a new expert slope over
the summer and installed lights on the advanced and expert slopes
for much more challenging night skiing. So far, however, the lack
of consistently cold weather has hurt Wintergreen’s skiing with
there being very little snow on the expert slopes.

While the weather has not cooperated completely so far this ski
season, there is still good skiing to be found in the East, whether it
is in West Virginia, North Carolina, Vermont, or Virginia.

All it takes is a few phone calls to check out the present conditions
and a decision about at which area to spend a day, weekend, or holi-
day week.

Many Students Benefit From ROTC Experience

by Dave Dudka

If it is true that “‘Washington
and Lee men have little trouble
finding dates,’’ (and who would
admit it even if it weren’t), then
it may be asserted that
Washington and Lee men have
even less trouble finding jobs
after graduation.

For this reason it is notable

that over the past several years ~

an increasing number of
students have committed them-
selves to serve in the Army
after graduation, whether it be
on active duty or in the
Reserves.

What is more interesting is
that very few of these students
had any intentions of being in
the Army when they first came
to W&L.

Each year many freshmen
and sophomores enroll in those
R.O.T.C. courses, which are
both open and _ nonbinding,
mostly from a passive interest
in the military, and because
they are an unusual alternative
to most electives offered on the
“hill,” (not to mention that
these courses are generally
easier to do well in).

For interested students there
are a variety of ways to serve in
the Army. Cadets who consider
an Army career will often
receive a ‘‘Regular Army”
commission which has a
minimum four year active duty
and two year Army Reserves
commitment.

A Cadet repels from the footbridge.

Cadets with R.O.T.C. scholar-
ships are also required to serve
for four years on active duty
and two years in the Reserves,
no matter whether they are on
one, two, three or four year
scholarships. It is noteworthy
that most of the Washington and
Lee cadets on_ scholarships
received them after they had
entered college.

Many cadets not on scholar-
ships will receive ‘‘Reserve”’
commissions which also have a
six year obligation with three or
four years of active duty and
the rest spent in the Reserves.
Those cadets not interested in
active duty usually choose to go
ADT (Active Duty for Train-
ing), which consists of just 90
days active duty and-a six year
Reserves or National Guard
commitment.

Although some students will
receive two or three year
R.O.T.C. scholarships, most
students interested in the Army
will decide before the beginning
of their junior year whether or
not to ‘“‘contract,’’ which is a
formal commitment to duty.

Those who do ‘“‘contract’’ at
the beginning of their junior
year have obligatory military
service after graduation and
receive $100 a month for their
last two years while in school.

Although $100 each month is
admittingly an incentive, it is
rarely a major factor in a stu-
dent’s decision to ‘contract’

 

 

 

with the Army.

When Cadet Junior Doug
Shipman entered Washington
and Lee he was only mildly in-
terested in the R.O.T.C. pro-
gram and never thought that he
would ‘‘contract.”’ His decision
to go into the military had much
to do with the good job ex-
perience and leadership poten-
tial that he believes the Army
offers as well as benefits such
as travel and an opportunity for
“personal development.”

Although Shipman has receiv-
ed a two year scholarship, he is
certain that he would have
“contracted” anyway.

Like Shipman, Cadet Senior
Bill Hill said he was ‘‘confident
I would not join’’ when he first
came to college but by the end

of his sophomore year both the _

money and the opportunities
had changed his mind. Some of
the reasons he gives for his
decision to ‘‘contract’’ are the
leadership training, confidence
building, and good opportuni-
ties he feels he will get from the
Army.

Hill intends to spend only 90
days on active duty and then go
into the Reserves.

This will not only be an extra
$180 per month but also a good
“change of pace’ from law
school which he plans to enter
next fall.

Cadet Junior Alan Pryor con-
siders the challenge of the Ar-
my as a major reason for his
commitment, although a three
year scholarship certainly
helped. Pryor’s idea of

; challenge consists partly of
| receiving airborne training, (a

three week parachute school he
attended last summer), and go-

3 ing to Ranger Camp for 11

weeks this summer which will

* comprise tough combat train-

ing under severe physical and
mental conditions. Pryor plans

~ to take a three year defferment

before going on active duty in

ferent reasons for wanting to

%, Edge is going not only for the

challenge, but also ‘‘just for

fun.’”’ Cadet junior Tom Gillan
hopes that Army experience
will made him a marketable
commodity in the business
world.

And yet, even with all its op-
portunities and_ benefits,
R.O.T.C. cadets do see that
there are problems as well.
Some are bothered by the enor-
mous amount of “red tape”
they expect to find and ques-
tionable regulations that must
be followed.

A major concern among a few
is having to do petty projects
designed to keep a large peace-

time army busy, and almost all ~

are aware of difficulties that
they will probably encounter
with an all volunteer Army.
Most are not very disturbed
about these problems, however,
because they would expect to
find similar ones in any profes-
sion.

In recent years the R.O.T.C.
department at Washington and
Lee has successfully maintain-
ed a low profile in contrast with
military programs at other
schools.

Students here generally feel
that this is the best approach,
particularly with a_ strong
military school like VMI as a
neighbor.

Unlike VMI, there are no
drills, no uniforms or short hair-
cuts; instead, the R.O.T.C.
Department sponsors a large
number of activities open to the
student body such as rapelling,
spelunking, backpacking and
orienteering, which all cadets
consider one of the strong points
of the program here.

One criticism seen by
R.0.T.C. cadets is that the in-
structors normally only remain
for three year periods, and
many feel this effects the con-
tinuity of the overall program.

However, most say they are
more than satisfied with the ex-
isting program, and some
believe that the ‘‘low key’’ ap-

proach is the only way that the
R.O.T.C. could survive on a
campus like W&L. ~

Although all the R.O.T.C,
juniors and_ seniors. see
numerous benefits and ad-
vantages with military science
of some type, very few consider
mading the Army into a career.

For some, the money is just
not enough, and for others,
there are different careers
which they would rather pur-
sue. However, many believe
they would like to remain in the
Reserves indefinitely, like
Cadet Senior Doug Barton who
called it ‘‘the best part-time job
you can get.”

The Reserves offer many of
the same opportunities and
benefits of active duty except
that the time commitment is not
very demanding and W&L
R.O.T.C. cadets find this ar-
rangement particularly appeal-
ing.

But no matter how long they
plan to stay in the Army, or
what their career goals may be,
all seem to agree that the Army
offers challenge and leadership
prospects unusual for someone
just out of college.

of Pigs. Valeriane has also
traveled over 400,000 miles
covering Henry Kissinger.

Despite his opening vow not to
simply criticize the President’s
foreign policy, most of
Valeriane’s comments were
critical of the Carter Ad-
ministration’s policy, or the
lack thereof.

“The president has learned
how not to pull troops out of
South Korea. how not to pass a
strategic arms limitation trea-
ty, how to be nice to Cuba and
Viet Nam and get nothing in
return and the merits of in-

consistency,’’ Valeriani said.

According to Valeriane,
Carter’s early policy stressed
an international “good feeling.”’

Carter set out to change the
“lone ranger’”’ image of foreign
policy established by Henry
Kissinger during the Nixon
years.

Carter initially took a hard
stance in favor of human rights,
reduction of the sale of

weapons, and was_ against
nuclear proliferation, said
Valeriane.

But the realities of world
power have caused the Presi-
dent to back off from his hard
line on these issues. The result

 

The News

There’s a new twist to armed
robbery.

An armed man wearing a
black stocking mask entered a
Bakersfield, Calif., 7-Eleven
store and successfully tied up
the lone employee and left him
in the cold storage locker.

Then the robber pulled off his
mask and waited on customers
for 20 minutes. He even told in-
vestigating police officers that
the report of a robbery in pro-
gress was wrong. After the
commotion had died down and
the police had left, the robber
did too, with $86 — $29 of which
he had collected in sales while
manning the register.

Marriage

An ad in the Willamette, Ore.,
newspaper read: “I will pay $
for any avail. female willing to
marry me. No sex.”’ The box
number accompanying the ad
belongs to an inmate at Oregon
State Penitentiary. The inmate
is taking college courses inside
the prison and the Veterans Ad-
ministration will pay him an ex-
tra $59 a month if he’s married.

Swim Team
Hosts

Davidson

The Washington and Lee
swim team continues a five-
meet homestand this weekend
when the squad hosts Davidson
College on Friday and Towson
State on Saturday. Meet time is
4p.m. Friday, 2 p.m. Saturday.

The Generals will seek their
first dual meet win in the
events, having suffered an 82-29
set-back to George Washington
University last Friday to fall to
0-4 on the year.

Several W&L swimmers are
included in the American Swim-
ming Coaches Association col-
lege division national time
rankings released last week.

Sophomore Mike Bernot is
listed in two events: fourth in
the 100 freestyle event, in which
he has qualified for the NCAA
Division III nationals, and
seventh in the 200 free.
Classmate Herb Gresens is
ranked 10th in the 1000 free.

Senior and captain Bob
Newcomb is listed 10th in the
500 free. W&L’s 400 free relay
team, composed of Bernot,
Gresens, Newcomb, and Ken
Johnstone is 7th.

In Brief

(VA pays single students $311
a month and married students
$370.)

“We don’t question why a
man gets marreid,” said the
local VA director.

The inmate says he’s willing
to pay some woman up to $250
and a three-year contract. He’ll
even pay for the divorce.

Recruiting

Patrick A. Pitts has been get-
ting Marine Corps recruiting
brochures for the last six
months, which wouldn’t be so
unusual if he weren’t 14 months
old.

Not only has young Patrick
been on the mailing list since
last May, he even got a call a
while back from a man who
identified himself as a
recruiter.

The boy’s parents say they
didn’t sign their young son up
for the service. A Marine Corps
spokesman explained that
sometimes. practical jokers
mail in recruiting forms with
someone else’s name and ad-
‘dress.

Justice

Old-fashioned justice return-
ed to a North Carolina court-
room when two teenaged boys
were given a choice of whipp-
ings or five days in jail.

One boy got his belts from his
grandmother right there in
court. The other was sent home
with a promise from his parents
that he would get his, but in
more private surroundings.

They had pleaded guilty to
resisting arrest in a case involv-
ing throwing fireworks and
stealing $20 worth of gasoline.

has been the projection of
Carter as an inept leader.
“Carter has become the
Rodney Dangerfield of interna-
tional politics,” said Valeriane.
Valeriane believes that
Carter cannot project an image
of being in control of foreign
policy and sometimes his own
administration.

“Sometimes a_ perception
becomes a reality,” said
Valeriane.

People perceive Carter as
“inept, ineffective and _ in-
competent,” Valeriane said.
The best example, he said,
was Carter’s relations with
Iran.

At one point early in Carter’s |

‘term, the President embraced
the Shah in public.

Yet while the President was
supporting the Shah in public,
the White House sent am-
biguous notes to the monarch
about’ relations between
tion,” Valeriane said.

The Ring-tum Phi, January 17, 1980, Page 11

America and Iran.

The problem became worse
when the skeleton embassy
staff was taken hostage and the
President did not take im-
mediate action, according to
Valeriane.

Admitting the Shah into the
United States and then sending
him to another country com-
pounded the problem, said
Valeriane.

“The Administration made a
policy then changed its position
under political pressure,’’said
Valeriane.

“The result is that the pro-
blem is the same now as it was
the day the hostages were taken
captive.”’

The Soviet Union is taking a
verbal tongue lashing from the
world community, Valeriane
said, but the Soviets expected
the reaction and knew the
President would not take im-
mediate action.

“They knew what they were
doing and calculated the reac-

Afghanistan has jolted the
President and his advisers into
a more realistic view of world

politics, the reporter said.

“My view is that we should
move the olympic games,”
Valeriane said.’’That would hit
them where it hurts, it would be
a sign of international hostility
and would deny the Russians an
aura of respectability.”

Valeriane contends the pro-
blem with the United States’
foreign policy is a lack of direc-
tion from the top.

“President Carter has not
been convincing in his foreign
policy, we have no clear con-
cept of it and no vision of where
it is going to take us,’’ said
Valeriane.

The consensus in Washington
on Carter’s foreign policy is
that it is ‘amateurish and in-
ept,” he said.

Yet Valeriane predicted that
Carter’s foreign policy may be
reborn or clarified when the
President gives his State of the
Nation speech.

Valeriane concluded his for-
mal speech saying, ‘‘Domestic
policy can hurt a president,
foreign policy can kill him.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Cheap Shots

No matter what your opinions are about the so-
called boxwood incident, it is not difficult to let your
emotions rise in the matter of Tuesday night’s
rematch basketball game against Hampden-Sydney
College.

In case you haven't heard yet, the Generals lost the
game—by a four-point margin. But it’s what happen-
ed during the game that should really irk you, maybe
even stir your blood a little.

You see, the Hampden-Sydney supporters ap-
parently travelled all the way to their new gym just to
try to humiliate our team in the most base manner:
they wore branches from boxwood bushes in their
hair and threw them at our team during a time-out in
the second half as a not-so-subtle reminder of the un-
fortunate incident here before Christmas.

The H-SC boys also had banners up to heckle our
team: ‘‘Farrell and Hoy—Nice Boxwoods, Nice Cap-
tains, Nice Team, Nice Institution” and ‘‘Save Box-
woods, Kill Minks.”’ But despite it all, our team han-
dled all the pressure with a lot of poise.

They even had their own raunchy little cheer to go
with the bush waving—B-U-S-H. Now that cheer pret-
ty much sums up our sentiments and the feelings of a
number of people in our sports department. If their
ever was a classless act, the H-SC basketball fans
Tuesday night outperformed it hands down.

Hampden-Sydney’s athletic director was at the
game, but made no attempt to quiet or control the ac-
tions of the crowd, although he did apologize to Coach
Canfield after the game.

W&L fans can be just as ugly and debasing. But we
hope our fans will not try to underclass the ’necks
from southern Virginia. In that respect, W&L
students have a lot to be proud of. Our basketball
team handled the pressure with a lot of poise.

The H-SC boys don’t aim very high—they aim about
groin level—but they kick hard. So congratulations to
all the Hampden-Sydney boys who were there Tues-
day. You all get the Ring-tum Phi’s cheap shot of the
month award for Most Unsportsman-Like Behavior.
You won it with no dissenting votes.

If that’s what they learn in Farmville, then we’re
damn glad we came to Lexington.

Crisis For Freedom And Integrity

To The Editor:

After essentially two decades of waning
American respect internationally, we now find
ourselves at a trial point in which terrorists such
as the ayatollah and outlaws such as Soviet Russia
are measuring our integrity as U.S. citizens. With
the new decade ahead, I find myself wondering
whether we can possibly withstand the current
position our government maintains on avoiding, at
almost endless cost, rather than controlling
foreign crises.

The causes are evident. For over two months
America has been held hostage in Tehran, with
ever more irrational demands. New links are con-
tinually being added to the chain of Russian ag-
gession and oppression in Europe. What are the ef-
fects?

For the past few months the effects have been

. reviewed through the eyes of the Ayatollah Kho-

meini. Thus far he has not overstepped his image
of the United States as a nation too feeble to place
its own ideals as a free country over those of ter-
rorist and outlaw nations.

Our trial is not without end, however, and the
verdict of the jury is for we as Americans to
decide. We are in a position to determine our own
future, just as those were 204 years ago who wrote
down their ideals of freedom and integrity in the
form of a constitution. It is these two ideals which
are now on trial.

Are we to fulfill, as we recently have, our image
as a nation steeped with decadence and sheepish
leadership? I only hope and pray not.

Persiflage

Dear Sir,

I was shocked that your last issue did not include
the reaction from either myself or my brethern. I
though that it was standard journalistic practice
to get statements from all the principal actors par-

ty to an incident. Either this is a misconception on ,

my part or another example of shoddy reporting
on the bchalf of you and your staff.

Your last issue did not even try to present our
feelings on the past tragedy. Instead, all you had
were articles dealing with the administration, the
basketball team, and the disgruntled heirs to the
‘‘Weeks Estate.’’ At no time was there any effort
to explain our point of view.

We are the ones who have experienced the
greatest sense of loss in this incident. We are the
ones who have lost friends and neighbors to this
brutal slaughter. We are the ones who must stand
a lonely vigil over our fallen brothers. But did
anyone spare us sympathy? Did anyone come to
console the relatives of those who died defending

The Forgotten Fallen Brothers

- For the liberties which we now enjoy,
Americans have had to make decisions similar to

_ those which we now face; and they have lived up

to their heritage as a nation founded on individual
freedom and integrity. Our decisions are again
difficult but quite evident. If we continue to avoid
and accomplish nothing, as we have done, then the
decision has already been made. Our only other
choice is to act, not simply to react, to gain again
respect internationally and a new self respect na-
tionally. The risk is great in either option, and the
loss or gain is equally enormous.

As a nation, and as individuals, we must decide
if the risk in acting is worth the consequences of
the slow decay of our ancestral base. For me, they
are, and I grow more concerned daily that we may
have already decided on our former option.

Am I alone?

Reacting To ‘Foolish Rhetoric’

Dear Editor,

After reading Tony Carli’s
statements in ‘Mocking the
Choice of Senator Goldwater for
the Convention,” I must react to
some of his foolish rhetoric.

One of the major strengths of
the American two-party system
is the diversity of each respec-
tive party. Senator Goldwater is
a major exponent ‘of the
Republican conservative point
of view. Republican Senator
Javits of New York is more
liberal than many Democratic
politicians.

Surely to the dismay of Tony
Carli, the American populace is
everyday embracing a more
conservative attitude. Witness
the popularity of proposition 13
and the general rejection of
sixties-style big spending pro-
gram’s such as Kennedy’s
socialist health care program,
as evidence of such. The Tony
Carli ‘‘we can save the world”’
brand liberalism should have
died with the sixties. Former
President Richard M. Nixon’s
political views are on the re-
bound.

When one reads the opinion
polls, one finds Teddy’s
mindless utterings are beginn-
ing to affect his popularity.
Carter’s popularity is rising,
due to his firm conservative
handling of the tense Iranian

On The Rally

Mixing Emotional Reactions

Imagine, if you will, the
following dilemma. It is 1938. A
middle-aged German man who
has been a bartender in the
American embassy for many
years, and who has formed
many American friendships,
decides that he abhors the
direction his country is taking.
He leaves behind the familiar to
immigrate to America — the
land which he feels will offer
him freedom, hope, and an en-
vironment which nurtures
humanism, not hatred. Under-
standably, anti-German senti-
ment runs high in his newly-

situation. Ronald Reagan’s ap-
peal is holding. This country
must not make a_ similar
mistake to 1964.

The blind obedience to ex-
treme liberal doctrines will be
the downfall of Kennedy. This is
the factor most affecting his
slide in the polls. It’s amazing
how the blind lead the blind to
slaughter.

I refer Tony Carli to Victor
Laskey’s It Didn’t Start With
Watergate. As a matter of fact,
I'll loan him my copy. Nixon’s

policy of detente has allowed
some benefits, such as SALT I.
Appeasement, no; brilliant,
yes. SALT II is appeasement,
the bastardization of a fine
policy.

Tony admits that liberal
Democrats are fewer in
number. I hope I have
demonstrated a few reasons
why. As for the possible election
of Ted Kennedy, we’ll cross that
bridge when we come to it.

MD Dance-A-Thon

Dear Students:
Once again Washington and
Lee’s annual Muscular

Dystrophy Dance-A-Thon is
upon us. The plans and events
for this year are set to go. Un-
doubtedly we are much more
organized than we were last
year.

But we still have a problem.
We need guys to dance!! There
are a lot of registration forms
out that have not been returned.
If you plan to dance, these
registration forms (the white
sheets in the information
packet) must be returned to
Carole Chappell in the Universi-
ty Center by Wednesday the
23rd of January. We need to
know how many people are go-
ing to dance so that the final ar-
rangements can be made re-
garding food for the dancers.

We think that it is now time to
explain exactly where the
money goes that is donated to a
dancer. There has been some
debate on this issue and we
would like to clear up some
misunderstandings.

First of all, Muscular
Dystrophy Association is the se-
cond lowest (Red Cross is the
first) organization in terms of
salaries and management. Only
3.2 cents out of every dollar
goes towards someone’s salary.
That alone is a very impressive
figure.

Next, 13.3 cents of every

dollar goes towards what is
known as fund-raising. This
helps support dance-a-thons
such as ours all across the na-
tion. It takes a great deal of
money to start a dance-a-thon
which the Muscular Dystrophy
Association provides on a loan
basis.

The last chunk of the pie, a
phenomenal 83.5 cents goes
directly to patient services.
This includes research, medical
services, clinics, summer
camps, professional education
and public education (pam-
phiets etc. ).

There is no trying to hide
where each dollar goes; in fact
we are quite proud of it. If
anyone wants more detailed in-
formation contact Carole Chap-
pell in the University Center.

So that’s where it goes. Our
goal this year is $15,000, but it
will be very difficult to reach. It
can be reached but only with the
help of people like you; danc-
ing. We think enough has been
said about the material benefits
of dancing in the thirty-hour
event. If you are going to dance
it must be in your heart. So have
a heart, help us search for the
cure and please ‘‘dance for
those who can’t.”’

Thank you

Readers React To The Anti-Iranian Rally

Professor
Ashamed Of
‘Lynch Mob’

Dear Sirs:

This morning’s Roanoke
paper reports, ‘“‘Screaming mob
at W&L protests Iranian ac-
tions.”’ The headline is an
understatement, if anything,
for it is also reported, ‘Later,
about 200 students marched on
Virginia Military Institute,
where nine Iranians attend
classes.”’

If this is not the first instance,
surely it is the most serious
manifestation of Lynch Mob
Mentality, associated as always
with Cowardice, in the history
of the University. In striking
contrast, the students in atten-
dance in December of 1941 exer-
cised the restraint and acted
with the courage expected of de-
cent persons.

While it is to be hoped that the
newspaper account is exag-
gerated, it matters little. A
Lynch Mob is a Lynch Mob is a
Lynch Mob whether its objec-
tive is intimidation or a
stringing-up to a limb of the
nearest tree.

Was Key To The Rally

Sirs,

I was rather disappointed at
the predominantly deprecatory
attitude taken by the press con-
cerning the Anti-Iran rally held
December 4th and the march,
which occurred shortly there-
after, through the streets of
Lexington. I was especially
dismayed that the Ring-tum
Phi’s editorial staff was the
leading source of disapproval.
Evidently those who wrote the
“‘opinions’’ were not present at
the rally. Either that, or they
sadly misinterpreted the event.

The key word in interpreting
the affair is Nationalism. The
pervading atmosphere at both
the rally and the march was one
of pride and unity, the cause
and effect of Nationalism. Na-
tionalism has served a vital role
throughout history in strength-
ening nations in times of trou-
ble. The feeling of American
pride, the Nationalism, did
much to unite the students of
Washington and Lee on that
Tuesday evening. Joining in one
the epithets against Iran were
both Southern students and Nor-
thern students. Joining in on the
several renditions of ‘“The Star-
Spangled Banner” were both
Democratic students and
Republican students. Chanting
for the release of the American
hostages in Iran as well as for
the release of Steve Johnson in
the police station were both
liberal students and conser-
vative students. The collabora-
tion of rival fraternities was a
further manifestation of the
rampant Nationalism ex-
perienced by all that night. The
rally and parade dissolved, for
a while, the ancient, rigid divi-
sions that have long plagued
W&L student body unity.

Albeit, mob action often gets
out of hand and does more evil
than good. However, Tuesday’s
occurrence did no ‘‘tangible’’
destruction (nor was it ever in-

tended to do so). A definite
alternative to the possible
destruction that does often oc-
cur with the emergence of a
mob is the simultaneous rising
of a charismatic leader who can
grasp the situation and in-
stigate the actions it requires.
This idea makes it ever so clear
how important the the up-and-
coming election is.

One of the editorials voiced its
disappointment that “‘one of the
finer liberal arts institutions in
the country” could drop as low
as any other university. A
‘recognition’ of responsibility,
it was said, is necessary to
those “lucky enough to be ex-
posed to higher education.”
Another recognition, which the
editorial seemed to miss, is one
of utmost importance at this
time of American turmoil: a
recognition that this country is
on the verge (if it has not yet
fallen) of a crisis which can be
altered only by a united nation.
Tuesday’s rally, and others like
it, although minute and localiz-
ed in its and their effects, was a
step in that direction.

Sincerely,
Fred Welden Caudill III

Opinion
Dear Sir:

In your reporting of Washing-
ton and Lee’s anti-Iran rally,
your editorial on the same and
particularly your Opinion piece,
you seem to have confused two
issues: a rally designed to show
support for America ina time of
crisis and a march that was a
result of mob action, of emo-
tions easily sparked, rather
than a planned consequence of
the rally. This distinction must
be made, for I imagine that if
the organizers of the rally had
had a chance to finish their
speeches, you might have heard
what is being echoes at forums
across the nation and in the
halls of Congress: support for
America, endorsement of Presi-
dent Carter’s handling thus far
of the crisis, and the sentiment
that while this country stands
for peace, it stands for peace
with horor and peace through
strength, a challenge we are
willing and able to meet.

At first President Carter ask-
ed for restraint form the na-
tion’s leaders; now he is asking
for a show of unity. At no time
has he asked for a stifling of the
opinion of the American people,
and you are criticizing some of
your peers for trying to give
theirs.

There is a difference between
the expression of opinion and
rabble rousing. I suggest you
are too quick to judge those who
were not heard. What would you
be saying, I wonder, if the rally
had not degenerated under out-
side influences and speeches
had indeed been given and even
finished? What if, then, as a
symbolic gesture, an Iranian
flag had been burned? Remem-
ber, ours has recently been used
to carry out garbage. What is
wrong with students, so often
accused these days of selfish-
ness and lack of purpose, wan-
ting to speak out in defense of
our national honor and price?

I further submit that the
‘Rights of Others,”’ as you so
entitled Opinion, were not for a
moment a target of the rally’s
organizers. I wonder how you
ever got that idea, unless you
simply jumped to a conclusion.

More Letters To The Editor

Disputing Dash Review

Editor:

I usually do not write ‘‘Let-
ters to the Editor’ but the
movie review in the December 6
issue of the RTP was.....

I respect Dash Coufal and his
opinions (after all, we both sur-
vived the R.E. Lee Hotel last
year), but his assessment of
‘Apocalypse Now”’ was a little
off base, through no fault of his
own. He wasn’t there — how
lucky he is! Books and movies
can project but can compensate
for first hand experience.

“Apocalypse Now”’ was very
realistic in the Vietnam portion
of the movie—the attention to
detail was accurate. Yes, peo-
ple did go water skiing and have
beach parties. When you might
be dead tomorrow, why not
make the most of today? After a
hard (and hot!) conflict with
the enemy, what could be more
refreshing than a dip in the
river or a cold brew? This may
sound bizarre today, but in a
“live today, die tomorrow’’ at-
mosphere, it was a very ra-
tional philosophy. If only we
had had road trips and Duck’s
to boost our spirits...

The Cambodian portion of the
film was very surrealistic—
mind blowing—contrived, etc.
Coppola wanted to make a

definitive statement on the hor-
rors of war and he certainly
succeeded.

Having been attached to 173d
Airborne on numerous occa-
sions, and frequently stationed
at LZ English (remember the
scene in the mobile home?), I
can’t really take Dash to task
for his review. He wasn’t
there—and it would be great if
no other W&L students have
similar experiences in the
future.

Sincerely,

Bookstore
Overcharge

Dear Sirs:

The Bookstore wants to
return an overcharge to a stu-
dent. We, wrongly, charged him
$3.00 too much for a copy of Cost
Accounting. He will remember
when I made the change in
price.

If he will come to see me I will
give him both the money and
our abject apologies.

Book Lists Summer

Employment Possibilities

Over 15 million students and
teachers will want summer jobs
in 1980. Many have started look-
ing already, but even those who
begin early may find jobs much
harder to come by this year
than last. Higher unemploy-
ment has made competition for
all jobs tighter than ever this
year.

If you’re looking for a sum-
mer job, there’s still a shortcut
way to find one. That’s with the
help of the 1980 Summer
Employment Directory of the
United States (Writer’s Digest
Books: $6.95), an annual hand-
book that lists employers with
over 57,000 job openings.

 

This year’s version of the an-
nual directory lists 900 summer
employers: amusement parks,
summer camps, national parks,
private resorts, summer
theaters, office temporaries,
marketing and sales organiza-
tions — literally everybody who
hires summer workers.

Foreign Policy Problems Discussed

to strengthen NATO forces and
has been behind increases in the
defense budget. Corddry con-
ceded that there will be time in
the upcoming years when the
United States will be militarily
inferior to the Soviet Union in
many respects. Corddry quoted
New York Senator Jacob Javits
saying that, “‘it looks like we’ve
been goofing off for the last ten
years.”’

Corddry said that for several
political reasons, a_ policy
change as fundamental as
reinstatement of the draft is not

imminent.

The armed forces, though
having difficulty recruiting per-
sons to fill the jobs most needed,
are still within three percent of
their overall recruitment goals.
Within a margin that close, the
draft is not a necessary
measure, Corddry said.

Also, with an election ap-
proaching, it is unlikely that
President Carter or the Con-
gress will want to initiate
anything as controversial as the
draft. “If Carter can’t get
together with the Congress on
something as ——— as gas ra-

tioning, how could he get them
to pass the draft?” Corddry
said.

The journalist noted,
however, that some work is go-
ing to have to be done to
strengthen the reserve forces.

Corddry concluded by saying
that the competition between
the United States and the Soviet
Union is more than a struggle
between two world powers.
“The competition,” Corddry
said, “is between values and

systems and cannot be treated
lightly.”

Team Uncovers

 

Ancient Indian

Hunting. Site

by John Hastings

The residents of Lebanon,
Va., will soon have a new water
filtration plant and they can
partially thank Washington and
Lee University.

During the last week in
December and the first week in
January over a dozen students,
alumni and faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee went to Lebanon to
excavate and authenticate what
appeared to be an Indian hun-
ting camp. The site is on Big
Cedar Creek in Russell County,
and is ideal both for hunting and
for a water treatment site, ac-
cording to Anthropology
Department intern Parker Pot-
ter.

In accordance with federal
law, any site or proposed con-
struction involving federal or
state funding must be ar-
chaeologically surveyed before
construction is allowed.
Lebanon solicited bids for the
project and received only one
other besides Washington and
Lee's. The bid came from the
Iroquois Research Institute
headquartered in Fairfax.

Although not officially disclos- 9
ed, Iroquios’s bid was
estimated at between eee

 

 

$30,000-$60,000. Washington and
Lee was chosen with a bid of
