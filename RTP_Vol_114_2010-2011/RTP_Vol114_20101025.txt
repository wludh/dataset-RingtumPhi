Internship

New Career Services
program helps studentsﬁnd
valuable internships

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Career Services is launching a new program
aimed at helping Washington and Lee students ob-
tain internships.

Junior Mac Davis created the program, which is
called the W&L Internship and Opportunity Initia-
tive.

The program’s goal is to help students expedite
the often tedious and time-consuming internship
search process. According to the W&L website, Da-
vis said that he “applied for 20 internships and spent
100 hours ﬁlling out applications, writing essays,
prepping for interviews and being interviewed.”

Students and staff of Career Services involved
with the launch of the Internship and Opportunity
Initiative program are contacting alumni in order to
locate a wide variety of available internships in sev-
eral different locations.

Seven major cities have been targeted for the
first year’s search: Atlanta, Ga., Birmingham, Ala.,
Boston, Mass., Charlotte, N.C., Washington, D.C.,
Louisville, Ky. and Richmond, Va.

Juniors Jayna Johns and Stephen Wilson said
they both see the value of the internship rogram.

Johns, a mass communications major, spent the
past summer working at WSET, the ABC affiliate
in Lynchburg. Johns discovered this opportunity to
work at the TV station by searching online.

Johns earned one credit from her summer’s work
and still needs two more credits to fulﬁll her degree
requirements. These credits must be ﬁlled during
this coming summer.

Johns is hoping for “something big” for this up-
coming summer. She has compiled a list of heavy-
hitters in the news and entertainment industries that
she would like to intern for this summer. Fox News
and ESPN are at the top ofthe list.

Johns said she equates her search for an intern-
ship at a big-name company to a college search in
the sense that she is applying “to the Ivy Leagues”
now. '

Wilson, a double major in politics and studio art,
said he is also hoping to land a bigger and better in-
ternship, after spending this past summer interning

with the program “Life Pieces to Masterpieces” in

Washington, D.C. .

Wilson took Poverty 101 as a freshman and was
able to ﬁnd this internship by using resources avail-
able through the Shepherd Poverty Program. He said
that he talked with Professor Harlan Beckley about
people who had interned with various programs in
the past, and ultimately decided that “Life Pieces to
Masterpieces” would be the best ﬁt.

Wilson said that word-of-mouth from fellow stu-
dents and advice from professors are two necessary
components of the intemship-hunting process.

The ﬂedgling Internship Opportunity Initiative
program adds another possible resource.

According to an article in the Wall Street Jour-
nal, the demand for internship placement programs
has increased from 15 percent last year to 25 per-
cent. The same article also said that more and more
parents are paying to help their child’s chances of
landing an unpaid internship. Some parents are even
going so far as to hire “marketing consultants to cre-
ate direct-mail campaigns promoting their children’s
workplace potential,” while others are bidding for
internships for their children in online auctions.

As internships become increasingly competitive,
W&L students have many opportunities to improve
their chances of obtaining a valuable position. Ca-
reer Services holds “Quick Questions” walk-in hours
every Monday and Friday. The lntemship Oppor-
tunity Initiative program will be updating students
about new positions throughout the year.

Students interested in ﬁnding out more about the
W&L lntemship Opportunity Initiative program can

line at wlu.edu/x51050.xml.

In his welcome address, Rector

of you here participated in this en-
deavor,” Childress told the trustees

One of the goals of renovating Newcomb was to maintain

President Ruscio said that indi-

the renovation effort. According to
his speech, _over 400 donors con-
tributed to the Colonnade restoration
process, with the’ largest gift at $5.5
million.

Ruscio also gave a brief history
ofthe building. It was built in I882
with money from a $20,000 gift in
honor of Warren Newcomb. New-
comb Hall ﬁrst served as the library

 

and then as the commerce school
before housing the departments of
history, philosophy, religion and so-
ciology. The building was last refur-
bished in 1936.

While preserving the histori-
cal authenticity of the building, the
renovation also incorporated modern
updates. Elevators, a women’s rest-
room, 30-inch monitors, improved
plumping and new technology were
added.

The restoration earned the Award

Strengthening the General’s Army  

A new contest sponsored by the bookstore attempts to create more support for Washington and Lee is athletes

By Hannah Esqueda
sun warren

This year’s General’s Army
shirts mark the beginning of
what many hope becomes a new
tradition for Washington and Lee
sports. The Athletics Department
and the University Store are
working together to sell and pro-
moteithese T-shirts as part of a
contest that encourages students
to attend more home games-.

“We want to promote some
sort of school spirit and get stu-
dents enthused about events” said
KC Schaefer, Assistant Direc-
tor of the University Store. “We
have a high participation rate of
varsity sports but we don’t have
a rabid fan base.”

Students participating in
the contest can buy a General’s
Army shirt from the store, and
then wear the shirt to any home
game. Each time they attend a
W&L sporting event they can
enter into a rafﬂe for a chance
to win one of several prizes. Ac-
cording to Schaefer, the raffle
ends in the spring after the last
W&L regular season so that “all
the sports teams will be treated
equally.”

Several members of the Ath-
letic Department came up with

the idea for the contest after no-
ticing that many big universities

who have large turnouts of fans
have similar promotions. This

past summer, Director of Athlet-
ics Jan Hathom and Sports infor-

The University Store is selling General’s Army T-shirts to

grow grow a fan base for
varsity athletics. Students who wear the shirts to sporting events throughout the

year can enter raffles and win prizes.

mation Director Brian Laubscher
approached the store staff about
bringing that tradition to W&L.
Together they worked out a de-
sign and slogan that they thought

themselves more to the gymna-
sium environment.

The store plans to continue
promoting the contest all year to
encourage students to support all

“We have a high participation rate of varsity

sports but we don ’t have a rabid fan base. ”

KC Schaefer, University Store

would appeal to students.

Schaefer said that he would
like to see the shirts every year in
a show of school spirit, but said
he realizes that they ﬁrst have to
see how this year’s contest goes.
So far, he is not sure how much
things have changed.

Schaefer mentions the “W&L
culture” as being a possible rea-
son the shirts have not been pop-
ular at football games yet. “Peo-
ple get dressed up for the football
games. There is something very
preppy about them.”

Still, nearly 200 shirts have
already been sold, and the store
expects that number to pick up
more once winter sports like bas-
ketball begin. Schaefer said that
the General’s Anny shirts lend

the W&L sports teams, big and
small. To make promotion easier,
the store now has its own Face-
book and Twitter accounts. The
accounts were activated on Oct.
21, and Schaefer said they plan
to use the social media to notify
students about new products and
promotions. They will also re-
mind students to wear their Gen-
eral’s Army shirts to each home
game.

Even though the contest is
targeted to students, Schaefer
says some parents and Lexington
locals have bought shirts. Since
the promotion is meant to get as
many people possible excited
about the Generals he said “the
contest is open to everyone.”

Coeducation and women leaders

Princeton professor Jill Dolan spoke last week about the process of co-education and women in leadership

‘By Paige Gance
STAFF wruren

Jill Dolan, professor of Eng-
lish and Theater at Princeton,
gave a talk last Monday focus-
ing on women and leadership,
both on the college campus and
in society.

Dolan’s talk, titled “Feminists
in Charge: Women Performing
Leadership,” was part of the
Johnson Lecture Series. Panhel-
lenic Council and Career Servic-
es have also both brought speak-
ers on women and leadership to
campus this semester in honor_of
a quarter century of co-education
at Washington and Lee.

“Sexism continues to plague
American culture,” said Dolan in
introduction to her speech on co-
education, activism and the cur-

rent status of women and gender
studies.

Dolan discussed both the
progress institutions like Princ-
eton and W&L have made since
admitting women and the work
that still needs to be done to
reach gender equality.

Before Princeton went fully
coeducational in 1969, Dolan
said that administrators worried
alumni would stop giving to
the university or male students
would stop applying.

Now, however, Dolan said,
it seems now that there have al-
ways been female students on
co-ed campuses. “Change gets
naturalized very quickly,” she
said.

Dolan continued to say that
this normalization can cause
people to forget the struggle
necessary for this change to oc-
cur. “It required myth-busting
facts,” said Dolan, and the “yield
of many years of activist agita-
tion.”

W&L professor Domnica
Radulescu helped bring Dolan
to this campus in the hopes that
her visit “would serve as a cata-
lyst for faculty and students to
engage more actively in campus
activism, to be proactive about
enhancing women’s leadership
on our campus.” A

Radulescu said she thinks
various courses in the women
and gender studies minor can

help improve discussion of these
issues at W&L.

“I think as per Dolan’s sug-
gestions, making the issues vis-
ible and having continued con-
versations about them,” would
increase “student’s sense of re-
sponsibility towards the campus
they love,” said Radulescu.

Radulescu also cited the “sex-
ist practices of the Greek organi-
zations,” as a source of gender
inequality. Dolan likened these
organizations to the eating clubs
at Princeton, which serve as the
main social outlet for students.

She used an eating club par-
ty invitation as an example of
the “bombardment of images”
that make up a negative “visual

diet” for college women. The in-
vitation was for a party themed
“CEO’s and Oﬂice Hoes” [sic],
and Dolan discussed the differ-
ence between the portrayal of
men as powerful and women as
objects. .

in another anecdote, Dolan
recalled how a ﬁrst-year girl
said some of the behavior by up-
perclassmen males was “preda-
tory.”

“Freshmen girls are particu-
larly vulnerable to sexual harass-
ment,” said Dolan.

At W&L, clubs like KEWL
and End It work to decrease the
high rates of sexual assault. The
Gender Studies Advisory Board
also works to bring programs,

events and new course offerings
related to these issues to campus,
according to board member Sara
Sprenkle.

Radulescu encouraged wom-
en to apply for leadership posi-

_ tions on campus. She said that

we need more than “token wom-
en,” we need a “critical mass” of
women in leadership roles.

Dolan ended her speech by
saying that she has hope for this
generation to bring about true
gender equality. Before opening
up the floor for audience ques-
tions, she said, “we need femi-
nism now more than ever.”

C finalizes budget policychange

A new policy implemented by the EC requires student organizations to update the Committee twice during the year

By Eleanor Kennedy
mews EDITOR

After multiple meetings and
several revisions, Washington
and Lee’s Executive Committee
has adopted a policy to audit stu-
dent organizations twice a year.

The plan, proposed by Vice
President Bill Larson, requires
student organizations to update
the EC on their activities every
November and February. Infor-
mation Technology Services is
creating forms which student
organizations can simply ﬁll out

and e-mail to the EC.

Larson drafted a proposal
about three weeks ago which de-
veloped a system for auditing or-
ganizations. Student organization
heads were then invited to three
meetings where they could voice
their concerns and suggestions.
Larson and the other EC mem-
bers worked together to compose
the ﬁnal plan, which incorporates
many of the students’ sugges-
tions.

The vote to pass the new plan
was unanimous.

EC President

Scott Centorino said everyone on
the EC was very excited about the
new version of the policy, which
he called “infinitely more stream-
lined” than the original draft.‘
Centorino said that many stu-
dents were worried that increased
EC oversight would involve more
bureaucracy and put an undue
burden on them. “A lot of mem-
bers of the EC echoed a lot of the
students’ campaigns,” he said.
After meetings with the stu-
dent organization heads high-
lighted several of the problem
areas of the proposal, the EC
developed and voted on the new
draft. Centorino and Larson both
praised the collaborative effort to
make the proposed plan a reality.
According to Larson, “The
new policy brings together the
best ideas of the EC and student
leaders to create a policy that will
ensure the student body’s money
is spent responsibly and effec-
tively, while not being overly
burdensome on student leaders.”

Centorino said he was pleased
with the EC’s responsiveness.
“What you saw was a really good
example of student government
responding to student concerns
in a really aggressive way,” said
Centorino.

The EC did more than just
increase its oversight of student
organization at its last meeting. lt
also created a new award to re-
ward student organizations that
excel at providing valuable pro-
gramming while managing their
funds effectively and responsi-
bly.

The Americus White Award,
named after the ﬁrst President of
the student body, will be awarded
every spring to a student organi-
zation chosen by the EC.

Centorino said that the award
will likely be accompanied by a
monetary prize to be used as the
winning organization sees ﬁt.

Administration and students responded to police concerns

After on-campus parties were shut down during homecoming due to noise complaints, the school worked carefully
with the Lexington Police A *

Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to
Stockton Bullitt’s October ll ar-
ticle, “The War on Noise and its
Effect on Off-Campus Parties at
W&L.” I read Mr. Bullitt’s ar-
ticle on the evening of the llth
and, after reading one of his ﬁnal’
lines: “Like I already pointed
out, the adults stopped reading
this long ago,” I felt compelled
to contact him directly. I felt
the need to contact him, ﬁrst,
because I wanted him to know
I do, indeed, read his column
every week ~ as I read each and
every Ring-Tum Phi and, sec-
ond, because I disagreed with
the assumption that “the admin-
istration” wouldn’t have much
interest in police shutting down
an event. He also discussed, at

length, the concern that shutting
down on-campus events encour-
ages students to go to off-cam-
pus events which, inherently, are
likely to have a higher degree of
risk. He also posited the correla-
tion that donations to the institu-
tion drive decision-making about
policy.

While I won’t go into as great
of detail as I did with Mr. Bullitt
in our email exchange and, later,
in our in-person conversation, I
will share that the “administra-
tion” is VERY interested in see-
ing events happen on campus.
l’ll brieﬂy share what actually
happened in response to one of
the cases cited by Mr. Bullitt in
his op-ed piece. The social chair
of the fraternity sponsoring one
of the events contacted me on

Sunday. ‘By Monday morning,
Student Affairs staff made con-
tact with the Lexington Police
to understand why the event was
shut down and, by Wednesday,
Student Affairs staff worked
with leadership of that fraternity
to convey the concerns and offer
suggestions as to how to avoid
in the future noise concerns that
were raised.

Regarding on-campus so-
cial events, 'I am very thank-
ful to Lindsay Crawford in his
leadership of the Interfraternity
Council, and for encouraging
fraternities to host events on
campus. And I am thankful to
individual house leadership who
chose to make the call and ask
for assistance when something
didn’t seem to be working right,

as opposed to simply going off-
campus in the future and making
higher risk choices. Such actions
on the part of IFC and house
leadership demonstrate a willing-
ness to work together. Likewise,
every signal I am receiving from
the new Lexington Police Chief
is that he and his staff want to
support students in safer choices.
And, with all of that said, laws
are laws and blatant violation
of laws results in arrests (and/or
sanctions in the University con-
duct system).
To be clear, donations do not
drive policy  student safety,
our educational mission and the
laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, drive policy. Anyone
iwho examines beneath the sur-
face of that statement can quick-

ly see that some might argue
student safety and the laws of the
Commonwealth may be in con-
tradiction. For example, if we
know students are going to drink
underage, can’t we just provide
a safe place for them to do that?
From my perspective it is a valid
point to make, but Washington
and Lee must abide by the laws
of Virginia in its policies — in
the same way private citizens
must abide by laws. And so we
provide the central message: “It
is illegal to drink underage, but
if you’re going to do so, please
do so in the safest manner pos-
sible and do not call attention to
yourself in your conduct.” In the
end, we are educators, not law
enforcement, and we put our role
as educators ﬁrst and foremost

No chase, big challenge: why being easy is hard

Campbell explains some of the pitfalls that can occur without parental supervision during freshman year

Everyone wants something
they can’t have. '

There is nothing as thrilling
as a chase and nothing as satisfy-

When I was little, most of
the things that I wanted were out
of reach because of my parents’
rules or my age.

I remember...

...sitting in the driver’s seat
of a stationary car for hours, talk-
ing on my “cell phone” and pick-
ing up my dolls from “school”. ..

Much has changed since
the days of time-outs, playing
house, and my mother’s strict
“one dessert a day” rule. Life has
changed.

Here at Washington and Lee,

ery kind of food I could hope for
at D-hall. Reese’s frozen yogurt
with honey, bananas, M&M’s
and chocolate sauce sound
weird? Everyone’s doing it. And

best of all, everyone takes the .

same walk of shame back to the
dessert table.

There is a never-ending ﬂow

I can drink as many Cokes as I

...wishing I could add enough

ﬁt into a’ cup bra...

everything that I could ever want

At ﬁrst, this seems ideal.

doing anything else. All of my

And I thought I was addicted

overdose or struggling to keep
my eyes open wide enough to
make the teacher think I’m look-

Thanks to the attractive pool

hosting events tough. When stu-
dents make choices that take into
account the complexity of the is-
sues we all face, then we’re see-
ing the type of student leader that

leadership.

Thanks, Mr. Bullitt, for rais-

for our conversations following

Strategy for finding the right teachers at Washington & Lee

How to minimize Snapes and maximize Dumbledores in the process of searching for classes

By Tim McAleenan
COLU MNIST

Now that half the semester
has already passed us by, our
dear freshmen (ahem, ﬁrst-years)
have ﬁnally learned what the rest
of us upperclassmen have known
for quite awhile.

Thomas Jefferson may have
said that all men are created
equal, but when it comes to pro-
fessorial teaching quality, noth-
ing could be further from the
truth.

To give you a rough estimate,
teaching quality breaks down
roughly to a I0-20-40-20-10
tiered system‘. .

The top tier is self-explanato-
ry. It consists of the three or four
life-changing professors you
encounter during your time at
W&L, and you can only describe
them with words like “Dumb-
ledore.”

At the tier right below them,
you encounter the professors
with their heads screwed on
straight.

As you will learn, this is
quite rare in academia, and these
professors must be clutched onto
at all costs. You’re drinking their
kool-aid, so to speak, and you
make sure to sign up for any
classes they teach that remotely
relate to your major. This is
good.

The middle tier is, by deﬁ-
nition, average. When describ-

’ ing your experience with these

teachers, you say things like
“Well, I,had to, for my major...”
or “At least I got a B.”

By the time you get to the
second-to-last tier, things are re-
ally moving downhill. These are
the types of professors who are
responsible for most of the page
views on the Registrar’s website
for dropping classes.

You’re not sure what the Fac-
ulty EC even means, but sud-
denly, the thought of dealing
with them and $100 ﬁnes doesn’t
seem like such a bad thing after
all.

These teachers are not always
easy to spot, but as a general rule,
they are usually teaching classes
that are absolutely required for
the completion of a given major.

And then there’s the bottom
ten percent.

This is what happens when
you merge the -personalities of
people who shouldn’t be allowed
too close to stoves and have the
personalities of Napoleonic Deb-
bie-Downers.

When you take a class with
them, you begin to understand
why tenure is every professor’s
wet dream, because no matter
how bad things get, like Brett
Favre, they’re here to stay.

And if you ever see the num-
ber “36” or “24” in a student’s
notebook, that means you have
found one of these teachers, be-
cause even on the ﬁrst day, the
student knew he had to start the
countdown until the end of the
term. ‘

But luckily, there are a few
mechanisms you can utilize to

avoid taking classes with the
Snapes of the teaching profes-
sion.

The ﬁrst, and most common
of all, is to visit the website
ratemyprofessor.com. I don’t
particularly recommend this op-
tion. Think about it, what type
of people are going to create an
account and leave feedback for a
professor?

Someone who has an extreme
experience with the professor:
they’re either spending their eve-
nings wondering what the Vir-
ginia laws are on student/profes-
sor relations, or they are crafting
a voodoo doll of that professor
Gust because, you never know, it
might work). .

Most of the opinions on rate-

, myprofessor tend to be extreme,

and I have found only a little bit
of correlation between the online
postings and the reality of a giv-
en teacher’s quality.

, You’d be much better offjust
asking someone in your frater-
nity or sorority for an opinion,
rather than consulting ratemy--
professor.

But when I want to get a de-
cent read on a professor before
signing up for classes, I usu-
ally send them an e-mail asking
about the course or to see if there
is room for additional students.

And here’s what to look for. If

you get an unduly long response

or a really quick response, run.
The best response I have ever
received when asking to join a

class was, “Why not?” Short,
mildly-humorous, and simple.
Ask this professor to be your
academic advisor on the spot.

Another important thing to
pay attention to is the professor’s
signature at the end of the e-
mail.

it can be incredibly insightful.
Ask the teacher to e-mail
you a copy of the syllabus be-
fore class starts. It can tell you
so much.
, I mean, a syllabus shouldn’t
be a threatening document, and
there are little warning buzz

tree!” You’re going to have a fun
semester with that guy.

Heck, one professor even in-
cluded the line (I’m paraphras-
ing here) “I’m a deals kind of
guy” in the syllabus. You don’t
think that is going to come in
handy around exam time? Like

Thomas Jefferson may have said that all men are created equal, but

when it comes to professorial teaching quality, nothing could be further

from the truth. To give you a rough estimate, teaching quality breaks
down roughly to a 10-20-40-20-I0 tier—system.

The number one sign of a
professor to avoid is a long tag-
line that lists all of the professor’s
accomplishments dating back to
their own graduation.

I don’t even know where to
begin on this one. It just sort of
comes off as pathetic and desper-
ate.

It would be like changing
your birthday on Facebook every
month to get girls to talk to you. I
mean, come on. There’s gotta be
a better way.

If you’re a quality teacher,
you accomplishments will shine
through in the classroom, and
you won’t have to brag about it.

If their e-mails are preten-
tious, imagine four months in the
classroom...

As for my last suggestion,
most students don’t do this, but

words to watch out for that can
give you a glimpse of things to
come.

My rule is to count to ﬁve.
If the teacher hands you a syl-
labus that mentions the number
“zero,” includes adjectives like
“unacceptable,” uses verbs like
“fail,” and includes nouns like
“penalty” and “violation,” steer
clear.

To use a dating metaphor, if
this is how the professor is going
to act on the ﬁrst date, imagine
what things will be like during
marriage. Yikesl

Ideally, you want to ﬁnd signs
of reasonableness or humor
(even if it’s incredibly dry) in a
syllabus. A calculus professor’s
syllabus once included’ the line
“What is a tree’s favorite class?
(Drum roll please) Gee, I’m a

anything else, when it comes to
syllabuses (or is it syllabi?), tone
means everything.

That’s about it. Visiting a
teacher during office hours won’t
help much; there must be a rule
somewhere that all professors
must maintain mini-libraries in
their oﬂices.

But again, if you can ﬁnd ev-
idence of a sense of humor, take

- that professor’s class.

If you do it right, you’ll spend
your ﬁrst two years here weeding
out the good and bad professors,
and then you can spend your
junior and senior years taking
classes with a strong nucleus of
the best four or ﬁve you’ve had
at W&L.

Epic drama on the national political stage this November

With Democrats spending needless time and money creating political drama, Beall asks where the issues went

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

All across the nation political

battles to the death have grown-

increasingly intense as many
candidates have pulled out all the
stops leading up to the big day:
November 2.

Incumbents and political in-
siders have sought to maintain
the status quo, but more and
more Americans are growing
so dissatisﬁed with the political
performance that we all can be
certain that change is coming,
just not at the hands of those who
promised it.

In California, where we lay
our scene, the stores of drama
know no bounds in times of po-
litical peace or war.

The candidates for California
Senate, Barbara Boxer-D and
Carly Fiorina-R, have locked

released information that’ Meg
Whitman had employed an il-
legal immigrant as her house-
keeper, and ﬁred her not too long
before the campaign began.

His claim is that she knew the
housekeeper was illegal, though
records show that the housekeep-
er was hired via an employment
agency, which had social secu-
rity and a driver’s license on ﬁle
for her. She had been in Califor-
nia since 1992, when one could
acquire a license without proving
citizenship.

Of course, who better to‘ de-
fend the housekeeper but the
infamous star-chasing attorney
Gloria Allred, an active Demo-
crat who has a penchant for creat-
ing very graphic media conflicts?
For her role in this obvious move

When he thought he had hung
up the phone, Brown and some
of his campaign staff started in
on a conversation resulting in
someone (most now think it was
Mrs. Brown) calling Meg Whit-
man a whore, and Brown heartily
agreeing.

Califomia’s branch of the Na-
tional Organization of Women,
who is endorsing Brown, "de-
manded disciplinary measures
from Brown for the use of the
offensive term. Later, however,
NOW—~like Gloria Allred—ac-
knowledged political expediency

cided to issue a press release all

Whitman a “political whore.”

lier. ‘ A

ward in the polls, Boxer began to
feature some particularly unﬂat-
tering pictures of her opponent in
her. commercials, and F iorina has
done the same: showing Barbara
Boxer looking aged, vexed and
maybe drooling a little.

For the California Guber-
natorial race, Jerry Brown-D
(formerly known as “Govemor
Moonbeam”) has also _ engaged
in smear tactics towards Repub-
lican Meg Whitman (commonly
referred to as eBay Lady), who
had been leading by a fairly large
margin.

Just aﬁer the ﬁrst political
debate, the Brown campaign

for publicity and political sake,
she was lampooned in an open-
ing sketch of SNL.

The San Francisco Chroni-
cle, Brown’s hometown news-
paper and one of the most liberal
papers in the nation, came out in
defense of Whitman and still re-

» fuses to endorse the Brown cam-

paign.

But Brown is famous for his
gaffes, and he made a pretty big
one that has all but reversed the
small effects of his smear cam-
paign. He made a phone call to a
Police Department Union in Los
Angeles and left a message ask-
ing for a political endorsement.
Even as Califomia’s current At-
torney General, Brown has lost
many of the law enforcement en-
dorsements to Whitman.

THE MEDIA BOARD

fomia is an interesting choice on
NOW’s part. But I guess in poli-

tics, drastic times call for drastic A

measures.
California is not the only place
where campaigning has got-

ten messy. In Delaware, Barack‘

Obama and Joe Biden descended
into the ring to back the Demo-
cratic candidate for Senate, Chris
Coons, over the Republican
Christine O’Donnell.

O’Donnell’s momentum has
been spirited away due to the
subsequent controversy over her
dabbling in witchcraﬁ, also high-
lighted in several SNL sketches.

The’ Obama administration
appeared at a very appropriate
place considering the theatrical
nature of the current political
climate.

They went to the largest op-
era house in Delaware and sang

songs of praise for Coons. All
this vocal support seems unne-
essary, particularly because at
this point Coons expects to win
the race easily. Bloomberg.com
observes, “Because Delaware
is in the same media market as
Philadelphia, the president’s visit
also draws attention in the larg-
est metropolitan area of Penn-
sylvania, where Democratic U.S.
Senate candidate Joe Sestak is

engaged in a close contest with,

Republican candidate Pat Toom-
ey.” ~
Leaving Wilmington, the
Obama troupe continued its na-
tion-wide tour by visiting Mas-
sachusetts for the incumbent
Democratic governor Deval Pat-
rick, who is in a fairly close race.
After that, they went to Ohio (the
Great Lakes swing state) where
the Democratic candidates are
suffering at the hands of their
Republican opponents.

Obama is especially inter-
ested in Ohio because one of its
Republican senators is retiring.

He then went down the west
coast and is now in Nevada.
Clearly, the President who was
supposed to usher in an enor-
mous amount of change has a lot
of spare time right now. I’m just
wondering why the taxpayer has
to pay for his gasoline!

South Carolina’s political
stage for the past year has been
airing drama, and it has only
continued through elections.

Inﬁdelity seems to be the the-
atrical theme as incumbent Gov-
emor Mark Sanford received
censure last June over his misuse
of state travel funds -to see his
Argentinean mistress. Making
matters worse, the GOP hope-
ﬁll Nikki Haley has been twice
accused of inﬁdelity in commer-
cials.

And all the while, W&L
alumnus Joe Wilson is still catch-
ing heat for his famous two-word
interjection, “You lie!”

/

But for the Senate seat, there
is a twist. Apparently, a ghost is
challenging the Republican in-
cumbent Jim DeMint. His oppo-
nent Alvin Greene is a 32-year-
old unemployed veteran who
won the Democratic nomination
with more than l00,000 votes

‘without any rallies or campaign

websites.

But this ghost has skeletons in
his closet, as it seems Greene has
felony charges brought against
him for showing lewd Internet
pictures to a college student.

But where are the issues? Ap-
parently they are on vacation in
Buenos Aires. '

There are many more cases
of drama across the US: think
Kentucky, Florida and Nevada.
However, the important point
here is that our political system’s
affection for the drama of poli-
tics over the function of our gov-
ernment is a big reason for the
recent failures sustained by our
government.

The party in power is guilty
of transforming the politicized
sections of our government into a
realm where spectacle means too
much and substance too little.

For example, ObamaCare
was not about providing Ameri-
ca with the best possible solution
to recent health care problems.
Rather, it was about a public dis-
play of power and revenge, by
putting on a C-SPAN prime time
showing of Titus Andronicus
with the GOP playing the part of
Ophelia.

All anyone needs to do any-
more to explode the diet in Con-
gressional deliberation is label
the other group with one word,
“extremist,” with or without just
cause.

Responses to the current po-
litical system, especially the Tea
Party movement and Republi-
can momentum in the elections,
seem to show that the American
people feel the need for govem-

ment to quit playing dress-up
and get back to the fundamentals
of government.

Why else would Constitution-
al themes take such prominence
in these political reactions?
America wants the stability and
equilibrium of a more perfect
union that the Constitution was
supposed to ensure.

America wants its problems
ﬁxed, and indeed there are more
than a few, but it does not want
each of these problems to be-
come mere stage settings in a
congressional reality TV show.

First order of business should
be the economy.

In engaging in behavior that
can only render political instabil-
ity, how can the economy recu-
perate? Economies thrive under
politically stable conditions, and
in examining the playbill of this
last Congress, there was nothing
politically stable about it.

As this most tumultuous of
decades comes to a close, we are
provided with a choice.

We can move on, or we can
continue to relive the past and
suffer at the hands of political
playwrights as we have suffered
for the past four years.

We can choose to bring an im-
mediate end to the cycle that ails
our nation, or we can perpetuate
that cycle and bring a mighty na-
tion to a slow and humiliating
decline.

That choice is manifest in an-
other choice, and fortunately we
live in a country where it is ours
to make.

You can vote and end it all, or
remain silent and leave America
to its political upheaval.

This is the election of a life-
time, and we all need to be
heard.

Adding a personal tone to the debate
over Obamacare

With elections looming, Victor Jackson puts to rest some of the debate over
health care by sharing his own experience

By Victor Jackson
c o L u M N IS T

Republicans have, over the
last year, told the American peo-
ple again and again of the alleged
evils of the program they have
lovingly coined “Obamacare”.

This evil program is the gov-
ernment overstepping its bounds,
they say, intruding into our per-
sonal lives and wrecking the free
market, an institution our coun-
try values so much. This could
not be farther from the truth.

The health care system in
America has, over the last 20
years, grown more and more
into a proﬁt-maximizing institu-
tion.

My mother, going through an
autologous bone marrow trans-
plant procedure last December,
had a month-long stay in the hos-
pital. _

Looking at the health insur-
ance statement showing the
crazy costs of such simple things
as bags of saline and clean bed
sheets every day was shocking.

More shocking was the small,
5-milliliter vial of medicine that
I held for a nurse one day’ when I

"visited my mother which, when I
checked later, costs $15,000.

I understand the costs associ-
ated with health care today.

I understand that advances in
treatment increase the costs of
medicine.

I have encountered many pro-
cedures as my mom has received
treatments, which are brand-new

and very effective, but very cost-
ly in their infancy. '

But like all other technologies,
the costs should trend downward
the farther they are from their be-
ginning, not upward.

regarding the simple, inexpen-
sive parts of a hospital stay like

a bag of sterile saline and clean-

sheets—it is clear that some-
thing has gone wrong. Health
care shouldn’t be about making

having to worry about whether or
not they will be the next person
to be struck with a debilitating
disease which they cannot afford
to cure.

We may be at the cutting

We may be at the cutting edge of health care technology in the world,

and we may have the worlds best health care system—for those who

can aﬂord it at least—but its time to make sure we extend this to

everyone, not just the privileged few who are fortunate enough to afford
the inﬂated costs of health care today.

I also understand that the doc- —

tors, nurses and professionals
who have toiled for many years
to become the experts they are
deserve to be paid well. That I
do not deny.

Over the last two years, I have
met many knowledgeable, caring
individuals who, every day, give
patients I 10 percent of their time,
attention and effort to make sure
they are improving and stay-
ing well, both in body and mind
—and they truly deserve com-
pensation for the amazing work
they do.

But when the prices of pro-
cedures which are not optional,
but required in order for people
to live, are so high—especially

as much money as you can, it
should be about health.

Republicans may complain
about health care reform, but I
say it’s about time.

It’s about time we take some-
thing as important as life out of
the hands of proﬁt-driven corpo-
rations.

It’s about time we make sure
that those who encounter dis-
eases and problems they are born
with, or that they develop not as
a consequence of their actions
but simply out of happenstance,
are taken care of during and after
their treatment.

It’s about time we make health
insurance more affordable so that

all people have the beneﬁt of not

edge of health care technology
in the world, and we may have
the world’s best health care sys-
tem—for those who can afford
it at least—but it’s time to make
sure we extend this to everyone,
not just the privileged few who
are fortunate enough to afford
the inflated costs of health care
today.

That’s why I support health
care reform.

It upholds that American ideal
that, no matter what your posi-
tion in life is, you always have
the ability and the tools to make
yourself better and be successﬁil,
despite what obstacles might be
put in your way.

Presidential assassins subject of controversial play

W&L students portray the lives and mentalities of several successful and attempted presidential assassinations

By Anthony Ballor
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s Music,
Theater and Dance Departments
present Stephen Sondheim’s As-
sassins, premiering October 28
in Lenfest Hall’s Keller Theatre.
Assassins is a controversial (and
musical) look at ten successful
and attempted presidential assas-
sins. Featuring an ensemble cast
which includes senior Johnny
Coyle as John Wilkes-Booth,
sophomore Tyson Janney as
Charles Guiteau (the assassin of
President Garﬁeld), senior Dave
Curran as Leon Czolgosz (who
killed William McKinley), As-
sassins presents pe0ple—some
patriots, some anarchistsrwho

have been viliﬁed by history,
despite motivations that were
sometimes noble.

‘ The play begins in a sinister
playground, where the Propri-
etor (sophomore Jay Stephens)
meets assassins from various
periods of American history, and
assures them that they can solve»
their personal problems by kill-
ing a president. Their problems
range from “[the] constitutional
right to peaceably petition the
government for the redress of
grievances” to, in the case ofGi-
useppe Zangara, a simple stom-
achache. Throughout the play,
we see the assassins talk to each

other~even though this would
have been impossible in many
cases—often egging each other
on to commit their crimes, or
convincing innocent people to
murder. For example, Lee Har-
vey Oswald is presented as plan-
ning to kill himself before the
assassins convince him to aim at
President Kennedy instead, tell-
ing him that murder is the only
way he can become part of the
American experience.

Assassins is clearly a gritty
play, one which confronts the as-
sassins themselves, but also con-
fronts the audience; it implores
us to ask ourselves what lengths

we would go to in our pursuit
of the American dream. Those
who are interested in history will
also be interested in Sondheim’s
transformation of the assassins.
Generally we know little about
assassins besides the nature of
their crimes, but on stage they
become human. The audience
sees both their transgressions,
and the aspirations which steered
them toward their fateful deci-
sions.

But don’t forget that despite
its subject matter, Assassins is a
musical. The pit band, directed
by Peter Del Vecchio, is distinc-
tive because it is staffed entirely

by students and community
members. Previously, pit bands
for the Bentley musicals had
been staffed by hired, profes-
sional musicians, but now, ten of
the fourteen members of the pit
band are students. The decision
to have student performers was
made in order to allow for more
educational opportunities for stu-
dent musicians, but according to
Del Vecchio, “the audience won’t
miss the professionals at all”.
For director Rob Mish, “Sond-
heim’s genius as a composer and
lyricist is evident mostly in his
treatment of the ‘period’ pieces
throughout the work.” Sondheim

plays with the music associated
with his material~for example,
look for strains of “Hail to the
Chief’ in a waltz, or a nod to
Sousa’s famous marches. Sond-
heim’s ability to suit his music to
the shows different time settings
results in some truly “humma—
ble” music, according to Mish.

Assassins will play in the
Keller Theater on Oct. 28-30 at
7:30 p.m. and on Oct. 31 at 3
p.m. Tickets are $5 for students
and can be purchased at the Box
Office by calling (540)458-8000,
or online at lenfest.wlu.edu.

Artist inspired by sense of environment

Artist Ray Kass speaks to W&L community abauthis exhibit in Staniar Gallery and his artistic techniques, experiences

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Artist Ray Kass spoke to mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
community this past Wednesday
in Wilson Hall. The renowned
artist discussed his exhibit “Since
Painting in the South,” his career
experience and his sources of in-
spiration.

“Since Painting in the South”
features a selection of 'Kass’s
paintings from the past thirty
years. The artist chose to present
these paintings because he felt
that they represented his relation-
ship with landscapes and the en-
vironment. Kass told students that

he seeks inspiration for his work
by spending signiﬁcant amounts
of time outdoors.

He believes that his work rep-
resents the essence of nature and
the emotional feelings that people
experience in various environ-
ments. Kass also said that he tries
to avoid creating literal represen-
tations of his pieces, but instead
wants viewers to interact with the
painting physically or by inciting
a memory.

Along with his artistic accom-
plishments, Kass is the founder
and director of the Mountain Lake

Workshop. According to the orga-
nization’s website, the workshops
are used to teach artists to use the
“environmental and technological
resources of the New River Val-
ley and the Appalachian region.”
Several well-known artists have
participated in Mountain Lake
workshops, such as'Howard Fin-
ster, J iro Okura, and John Cage.
Kass is a nationally recog-
nized painter and has had works
exhibited across the county. The
majority of his pieces currently
reside in the Reynolds Gallery in
Richmond, Va. Staniar Gallery

will exhibit Kass’ paintings until
Nov. 11.

Kass is currently a Professor
Emeritus of Art at Virginia Tech.

Lee defeats Jackson in Classic

Men 3 lacrosse closes the fall season with a 16-5 victory over VMI

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s men’s lacrosse
team took apart the Virginia Military Insti-
tute’s team on Saturday for a 16-5 victory
in this year’s Lee-Jackson Classic.

Over 600 spectators attended the 24th
annual encounter between the two teams,
played at VM1’s Foster Stadium, as, W&L
scored three points in every period except
the third—where they put up seven.

The Generals’ scoring for the day was

led by junior Scott Meehan and sopho- .

more Jack Switala, who each scored four
goals. Sophomore Cooper Brown contrib-
uted with three assists for the game. Mee-
han also added two assists.

Meehan was awarded the Worrell-Fal-
lon Trophy at the end of the game, which
is presented to the team MVP from each
squad. Freshman Ross Whitehead earned
the honor for VM1 as he contributed two
goals for the Keydets.

The Generals started the game strong,
quickly scoring three straight goals, each
of which came courtesy of Meehan. VM1
put up their ﬁrst score in the second quar-
ter, but the Generals could not be stopped.
The Keydets’ ﬁrst score was the closest
they would get to the Generals, who an-
swered VM1’s goal by putting up seven
unanswered scores. The Generals were

leading 10-1 just minutes into the third
period.

Ending a nearly 16-minute scoring
drought, VM1 managed to score two goals
in the third and add two more in the ﬁnal

minutes of the game, but they could do ‘

nothing against the Generals attack.

Six of the Generals’ scores did come
from VM1 penalties, as they racked up 17
for the day. But W&L outshot VM1 46-20,
clearly showing their ability to ﬁnd scor-
ing opportunities.

Saturday’s game marked the end of the
fall season for the Generals. They will be-
gin play again in February.

teams resulted in a split against Mary
Washington last Friday night.

The men beat the Eagles with a score
of 141-121, while the women fell 149.5-
112.5.

The highlight ofthe evening came from
10 General victories, eight of which were
individual events while the other two were
relays.

Five different Generals, had ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes for the men. Junior Brian Stirling
and sophomore Rick Sykes led the team,
each claiming a victory in an individual
event while also playing a role in two win-
ning relays. Stirling and Sykes were part of
the victorious 200—yard medley relay team
and 200-yard freestyle relay, and Stirling
won the 100-yard freestyle event while
Sykes took the top spot in the 50-yard free-

style event. .

On the women’s side, ﬁrst-year Lauren
Kasoff had two ﬁrst-place ﬁnishes for the
Generals, ﬁrst in the 100-yard butterfly,
followed by the 200-yard individual med-
ley. Junior Katie Salvati also won an in-
dividual event, taking the top spot in the
100 fly.

The women competed again Saturday 
in the ODAC Relays held at W&L, which »

ended in an impressive home team win
over six other schools.

The team captured six event victories,
led again by Kasoff, who was part ofthree

winning relay teams. Juniors Katie Salvati -9

and Dana Fredericks, sophomore Brittany
Ross and ﬁrst-year Rebecca Lawrence
each helped two relays to victory.

pressive beginning on Friday when they
