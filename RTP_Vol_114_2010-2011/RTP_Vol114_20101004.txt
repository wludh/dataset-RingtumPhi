EC meets
with student
organizations

Proposed plan would give
the EC more oversight

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

Washington and Lee’s Executive Committee is
developing a new program to better communicate

with student organizations in order to more efﬁ- V 3

ciently manage fund distribution.

According to EC Vice President Bill Larson, the
EC bylaws require the vice president to audit stu-
dent organizations. Until now, there has been no sys-
tem for doing so.

Larson, who has seen the budgeting issue from
the perspective of both organization leaders and the
EC, drafted a proposal for a system that would im-
prove the EC’s understanding of student organiza-
tions. '

Under Larson’s proposed plan, student organiza-
tions would update the EC on their activities at least

once a semester. Larson said his goal is to make the . ,

EC more aware of these organizations’ activities
throughout the year so that the budgeting process is
“easier and more fair.”

Larson also said that it is important to “make sure
student organizations are being responsible because
[their budget] is the student body’s money.”

EC President Scott Centorino said that he saw
the need for more structure in EC auditing when. he
served as vice president. Although he has not been
directly involved in Larson’s.development of the
new program, Centorino said, “I tliink—l1e’s done a
great job.”

Larson stressed that the proposal he came up with
was just a draft, and he wants to incorporate student
opinions. Last week, the EC held three meetings for
headsof student organizations to voice their opin-
ions on the new plan. Larson said 50 or 60 organi-
zation heads came to the meetings and had “really
good ideas.” A

“[ T he goal is to create] a structure
that encourages responsible use of

~ student funds... while maintaining
student liberty. ”

Scott Centorino, EC president .
 >

One of the students in attendance at last Tuesday’s
meeting was Tricia King, the head of W&L’s largest
student organization,: Mock Convention, . She said
she was “a little bit hesitant” at ﬁrst, because she
had heard a lot of students complain about increased
oversight. However, according to King, all of the
students at her meeting offered “constructive criti-
cism” and great ideas to improve the proposed plan.

For example, in Larson’s original draft, student
organizations are required to send a representative to
an EC business meeting once a semester. King said
that the students at her meeting suggested that the
updates could be done through e-mail to decrease
the burden on organizations.

Centorino said he understands students’ concerns
about increased bureaucracy. However, he said that

P p this program is “something that has needed to hap-

pen for a long time.” -
According to Centorino, the adninistration woul
have probably stepped in in the near future without
the implementation of some kind of structure. Since
W&L is a school that prides itself on self-gover-
nance, Centorino said administrative intervention
would certainly be even less advantageous than a

small amount of increased student oversight. “The ’

EC is deﬁnitely kinder than faculty oversight would
be,” said Centorino. ‘

Larson said that the administration is both “sup-
portive and excited” about the steps the EC is taking
to implement a structure. He also said he is going to
incorporate many of the ideas from the student meet-
ings into the ﬁnal proposal he brings before the EC

Both Larson and Centorino said it is important to
them that students are not overburdened by this new
program. Larson said that students should not expect
the new system to add any more than an additional
hour to the time they currently spend working for
their organization.

Accordirig to Centorino, the goal is to create “a
structure that encourages responsible use of students
funds... while maintaining student liberty.”

STAFF WRITER

After several months of work, the
ADPi Sorority House is well on its
way to completion.

The Theta Zeta chapter of Alpha
Delta Phi recruited its ﬁrst pledge
class in 2009, but had no house
where the sisters could live, come
together, eat and hold weekly chap-
ter meetings. Fortunately, the new
ADPi house is almost complete '
and will be ready for residents in
the fall of20ll. '

Project Manager Carole Bai-
ley said that the new house will
be LEED certiﬁed. LEED, which
stands for Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design, is a
certiﬁcation issued by the United
States Green Building Council,
USGBC. Bailey says that design
elements and construction efforts
to obtain Basic LEED Certiﬁcation
are the most signiﬁcant distinctions
that the house will have.

Some of these efforts are listed
below: '

struction debris will be diverted
from the landﬁll.

- 10% of the building ma-
terials will be from recycled con-
tent. _

- 10% of the building ma-
terials will.be manufactured re-
gionally. ‘

- Entire building systems
are designed for efﬁci_ent use of
water and electricity.

- The mechanical and
electrical systems will be commis-
sioned to. ensure correct installa-
tion and set up, therefore enabling ‘

- Window quantity and
placement is to maximize daylight.
Bailey said that “the University
was diligent in designing the ADPi
house in a very similar way to en-
sure parity with the existing houses.
Small changes that might be noticed
once the house is completed would
be due to knowledge gained from

main ﬂoor, and a chapter room on the
bottom ﬂoor.

One difference between the new
sorority house and the others is that
ADl_’i will not have a full kitchen,
but will be sharing with Kappa. This
is deliberate: a half-kitchen is more
environmentally friendly.

Cugliari said she is excited for

Young alums: coming home again

Recent alumni will return to campus this weekend for both Homecoming and Young Alumni weekend events

By Chelsea Stevenson

STAFF WRITER

Approximately 500 to 700
W&L alumni will grace the Gen-
erals with their presence this
Friday and Saturday for W&L’s
second annual Young Alumni
weekend.

The weekend’s events will
celebrate alums who have gradu-
ated within the last 15 years. Ac-
cording to Executive Director of
Alumni Affairs, Beau Dudley,
’74 ‘79L, each class will be rep-
resented.

On Friday, alumni will have
the opportunity to attend a pro-
gram hosted by W&L’s Johnson
Professor of Entrepreneurship
and‘Leadership,‘ Jeff Shay. At 4
p.m., Shay will discuss new en-
trepreneurship in Huntley Hall.
Alumni can also partake in a
campus tour and a reception at
the Lee House in honor of the

President’s Society.

On Friday night while the
class of 2005 celebrates their 5-
year reunion, the class of 2000
will be celebrating their 10-year
reunion. Each class will attend a
Welcome Reception and ‘cocktail
party at Wilson Field Plaza.

Dan Grattan, ’00, who is the
co-chair ofthe class of2000’s re-
union, said he is looking forward
to the reception because many of
his classmates haven’t been back
to visit and have yet to see Wil-
son ﬁeld. According to Grattan
this will be the first time that the
members of the class of 2000 will
be together without other W&L
alums. “We have never had the
chance to do something like this,
because at the last reunion there
was no speciﬁc space for just our
class,” said Grattan.

W&L is expecting nearly
100 members from the class of
2000 alone. “Class members will
come from all over the coun-
try, including Texas, California,
Florida and the upper Midwest,”
said Grattan. Gratten credited
co-chair Ginger Baker, ‘00, with
helping to bring this many alums
back for their reunion.

The co-chairs for the class"

of 2005’s reunion are Patrick
Hastings, ’05, and Emily Wolf-
ing Heinauer, ’05. According to
Beau Dudley, the class chairs
were chosen based on their dedi-
cation to W&L and how well
their classmates knew them.
The alumni and development of-
ﬁces also assisted in selecting the
class co-chairs.

Following the celebratory
reception, a band party featur-

ing 10 spot will take place for
alumni near the Ruins. 10 spot,
which was formed in 2001, is a
ﬁve-piece band that plays a va-
riety of music, from classic rock
and Motown hits to today’s top
hip-hop songs.

Saturday will feature many
events for the alumni’ ranging
from athletics to a bluegrass
barbecue. The day will begin
with something that last year’s
Young Alumni Weekend didn’t
offer: “Story Time for the Young
Ones.” At l0 a.m., a W&L facul-
ty member will read to children
of alumni in the library’s North-
en Auditorium.

Meanwhile, alumni can at-
tend the alumnae lacrosse game
on Alumni Field or take a tour of
Wilson Field. A lacrosse game
for male alums will take place at

4:30 p.m. on Wilson ﬁeld. Grat-
tan, who played on the men’s
varsity lacrosse team during his
time at W&L, said he is looking
forward to the alumni game.

W&L’s rugby team will also
play at home on October 9, on
Fuge Field. The l p.m. match
will be played against The Col-
lege of William and Mary.

The football team will kick
off at 1:30 p.m. against Emory
and Henry. Alumni will have
the opportunity to participate in
an athletic tailgate on the Law
School ﬁeld prior to the game.

After a day celebrating Gen-
erals spirit, alumni will gather
on the front lawn for a wine and
beer tasting and BBQ dinner with
bluegrass music. Due to the ex-
pected capacity of this weekend,
the location has been changed

from last year’s tasting, which
took place near the Ruins.

Dudley and the other staff
members of W&L’s Alumni Of-
ﬁce are excited for the upcoming
weekend and hope that it will be
just as successful as last year’s.
“It’s a pleasant surprise, when
you start something new, after
you’ve been doing something for
a while, and people come and ex-
perience exactly what you hope
for. We think that we’re starting
something that will catch on and
we hope that this group will re-
act the same way that last year’s
young alumni did.”

Celebrating Granvil George’s life

A memorial Friday afternoon offered the W&L community the chance to say a final goodbye to Granvil George

By Sam Gilleran
COPY EDlTOR

Dozens of students, faculty
and staff turned up in Wilson
Concert Hall Friday afternoon to
commemorate the life of Granvil
George, the Washington and Lee
senior who died ofgerm cell can-
cer on September 20, a few days
short of his 21st birthday.

Organized by his fellow stu-
dents and Dean Tammy Futrell,
the service was ofﬁciated by Rev.
Jon Talley of Reformed Univer-
sity Fellowship and Kevin Wat-

also in attendance.

Before the memorial service
began, clips of Granvil’s piano
recitals at W&L were projected.
Kevin Watkins opened the ser-
vice with a call to worship, fol-
lowed by a Scripture reading
from 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 by
Christian Roden, one of Gran-
vil’s freshman hallmates. Wat-
kins then gave a prayer, and those
assembled sang the hymn “On
Christ the "Solid Rock I Stand,”

Six community members, in-
cluding ﬁve students, eulogized
Granvil. They all spoke of his
humble nature, his academic bril-
liance, his competitive and ad-
venturous spirit, his love of food
and his deep Christian faith.

Granvil’s philosophy adviser,
Dr. James Mahon, also spoke
movingly about Granvil, as he
did at Granvil’s funeral in W. Va.
Mahon said that one of things
he would most miss -was the op-

the GRE and, while undergoing
treatment, had applied for fel-
lowships and proposed his senior
thesis.

After the eulogies, members
of the W&L Chamber Singers,
under the direction of Dr. Shane
Lynch, sang an arrangement
of “The King of Love” by Paul
Christiansen. The service then
came under the direction of Rev.
Talley. Talley gave a homily la-
menting the loss of Granvil, but

rial was one of the most difﬁcult
things to do as a minister, stating
in his homily that “there are no
classes in seminary for leading a
memorial service for a 20 year-
old.”

Dawn Watkins, Dean of Stu-
dents, came to the microphone
after the homily was concluded
and communicated a message
from Pres. Ruscio, who was out
of town and unable to attend Fri-
day’s memorial. She. also gave

tion from the book of Hebrews;
following the benediction, there
was a slide show of pictures of
Granvil, his family and friends.
Finally,’ Dean Futrell presented
Granvil’s parents with a framed
picture of Granvil, and the crowd
was dismissed to a reception in
the atrium of Wilson Hall.

The ﬁrst Fall Nabors Service

then the event has maintained its
strength and support. Holding
a Nabors Service Day early in
the year “helps to get everyone
involved,” said Kate Michelini;
one of the Special Project Chairs
for the NSL, “especially the

The volunteers were dis-
persed to various sites on and

I “My belief is that volunteer-
ism is kind of like a currency for
humanity,” said Nabors Special
Project Chair Joan Oguntimein.
She said that she considers com-
munity service to be a valuable
experience not just for those who
are being helped, but also for
those who are sacriﬁcing their
time and doing the helping.

According to Oguntimein,
the hope of the members of the
NSL is that students who volun-
teer on Nabors‘ Service Day will
make connections to the service
sites and will want to return to

Each person who sac-
riﬁced four hours of
his or her Saturday

reason for doing so.

Sophomore Juhi
Amin, the NSL Issue
Project Assistant and a

er, said that volunteer-
ing allows her to apply
what she learned in her
Poverty l0l classroom
to real life. '

Nabors Service
Day is not the only
event that the NSL or-
ganizesvthe Nabors
committee members
will be busy all year
working to get stu-
dents connected with
the Lexington commu-
nity through service.

Donnelly ex-
plained that NSL has
many events planned,
already, including a
Halloween carnival
for kids in Lexington,
-blood drives, a Spring —
Nabors ‘ Service Day
and Hunger and Homelessness
Week.

NSL serves as a liaison be-
tween students and organiza-
tions, ﬁnding placements for vol-
unteers in areas of interest, such
as working with children, work-
ing with the elderly or working
with the Campus Kitchen.

Oguntimein promises pro-
spective volunteers‘ that “to be
able to see your investment make
some returns is really a wonder-
ful feeling.”

Mark Zuckerburg and “The Social Network” can suck it

Furious at the F acebook founder is lack of character, Jon Salm gives the only negative review of “T he Social

Network ”

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I ST

A movie came out Friday
night that has been dubbed the
“ﬁrst truly great fact-based
movie of the 21st century” by
the New York Post, the “movie
of the year that also brilliantly
deﬁnes the decade” by Rolling
Stone and “brilliantly entertain-
ing and emotionally wrenching”
by the New Yorker.

What could a movie receiv-
ing such universal acclaim be the
topic of‘? Facebook, of course.

“The Social Network,” often
egregiously referred to as “the
Facebook movie,” comes with
an impressive Hollywood pedi-
gree.

Written by acclaimed screen-
writer Aaron Sorkin and pro-
duced by Academy Award win-
ners Scott Rundin (“No Country
for Old Men,” “There Will Be
Blood”) and David Fincher
(“Zodiac,” “The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button”), “The Social
Network” has all the makings of

First, the subject of the ﬁlm
is still in its infancy. It would
be like making a biopic of Ryan
Leaf following his ﬁnal season at

tory. “He’ll be a much better pro

onto the social networking scene
in 2003 with an enigmatic cre-
ator, Tom, and a penchant for
both reliable social network-
ing as well as some incredibly
creepy users.

Despite the creepiness,
Myspace was a runaway success.
But now, Facebook boasts over
500 million users while Myspace
can only claim 66 million.

Sure, Facebook looks great

right now, but then again so did
Myspace circa 2005.

What’s to say in another ﬁve
years Facebook has been reduced
to a paltry 66 million users while
another social network takes its

place?
Not only will I boycott “The
Social Network” because of

Facebook’s relative infancy, but
I will also boycott it because
of its holier-than-thou, super-
douche of a creator and CEO,
Mark Zuckerberg.

Much controversy remains
surrounding Zuckerberg’s in-
volvement with HarvardConnec-
tion. com (now C onnectU. com).

Similar to Facebook, Har-
vardConnection was founded by
Harvard students as a Harvard-
exclusive social networking site.

Before the site’s launch, the
creators hired Zuckerberg as
a coder. After working on the
project for about two months,
the eventual Facebook founder
dropped their project to work on
his own.

That project became Face-
book, which quickly eclipsed the
former in both success and popu-
larity. D-bag move? I think so.

While early reviews of The
Social Network have noted the
Zuckerburg’s portrayal as an
anti-hero, it pales in comparison
to the opinion I (and likely many
others) have already formed.

An article from businessm-
sider.com last May leaked an
instant message conversation be-
tween Zuckerburg and a friend:

“Zuck: Yeah so if you ever
need info about anyone at Har-
vard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000
emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend’s Name]:
What? How’d you manage that
One?

Zuck: People just submitted
it.

Zuck: I don’t know why.

Zuck: They “trust me”

Zuck: Dumb f“‘**s.”

Even more messages, in-

cluding those about his work on
Harvard Connection, are just a
Google search away.

I am boycotting this ﬁlm on
premise—and not because of
poor quality (in fact, it seems
to be exceptionally good), but
because of the premise of Face-
book itself.

Quick recap: arrogant, Ivy-
league educated 19 year-old
goes on to become the world’s
youngest billionaire by steal-
ing ideas and then cashing in on
“his” success.

Perhaps this boycott stems
from jealousy, but I choose to
believe it comes from a purer
place. “The Social Network” is
out now.

It may be a good ﬁlm, per-
haps the best of the year, but I
guarantee that you won’t catch
me dead seeing it.

Getting up to date with all the situations on “Jersey Shore”

Washington and Lee is most medium ginger pitcher recaps America is most ingenius television show since “Tyra ”

By Patrick Smith
COLU M N I ST

I am proud to say that I am a
native of the Garden State. I re-
member growing up and driving
down I-287 S to Bay Head, New
Jersey with my family.

We would visit my grand-
mother, who lived there for over
40 years, and have a grand ole’
time.

I loved the boardwalk fries,
Caricatures, Ferris wheels and
the clear, crisp ocean water (okay,
maybe that last one is a stretch).
Then something happened...

Dec. 3, 2009, marks a monu-
mental day in my homeland’s
history, and I remember it like it
was yesterday.

It was a cold and dreary night,
with not a stir in the air. I turned
on my television to enjoy some

. late-night entertainment, and on

it came: the season premiere of

“The Jersey Shore.” It was ter-
rible.

Terribly amazing that is.
You know what they say—any
press is good press, and boy did
New Jersey get some press that
night. The show featured a man
calling himself ‘The Situation”;
how great is that? Really ﬂippin’
great.

SPOILER ALERT. This is
the point in the article where you
should stop reading if you have
not seen last Thursday’s episode
(9/30).

If you do not care that I am
about ruin the world’s best real-
ity show for you, I strongly en-
courage you to read on.

As you all know, Angelina
is back after ditching the show
in the second week of the ﬁrst
season. She decided to be room-

mates with Pauly D (my boy),
and Mike “The Situation” (does
he have a last name?).

This is tailor-made drama,

The headline of last week’s
episode and the season ﬁnale pre-
miering Oct. 7 revolves around
Snookie. I have a direct quote

Snookie: ‘What I would love to ﬁnd is a juice
head. Can I ﬁnd that somewhere? Cuz I ’m not

gonna go on Match.com again. ’

people. As everyone and their
mother know, Angelina punched
The Situation in the face after a
strong verbal altercation involv-
ing some PG-13 language. The
Situation went on to ironically
downplay the situation.

Just kidding... he made it a
huge deal and Angelina left the
show. Who cares, she sucks.

from Snookie that occurred dur-
ing last episode.

“What I would love to ﬁnd
is a juice head. Can I ﬁnd that
somewhere? Cuz I’m not gonna
go on Match.com again."

Come to Washington and
Lee, Snookie. Copious amounts
of guido-gorilla-juicehead-ﬁst-
pumpers, left and right. I love

extending words. Currently in
the Snookie saga, Snookie is
Snookin’ for some love. Below I
have a list of demands courtesy
of the guidette herself. And I
quote...

Snookie’s Ideal man:

I. Tan guido-juicehead-go-

2. Big sense of humor

3. Likes to party

4. Fist pumps

5. Frolics (?)

So tune into the “Jersey

witness greatness in the true
sense of the word.

See what happens to Snookie,
and see what type of Situations
can possibly occur.

I’m sorry, ' my Microsoft

All about oral: how to get girls using words, not your body

Campbell Burr tells guys what proper and inproper diction to use when cajoling women into falling head over heels

By Campbell Burr
C0 LU M NIST

When I show my college
friends pictures of the most desir-
able boys from my high school,
some of them are surprised.
“He’s not that cute.” “Looks like
he’s 5!” “Ew bad haircut!”

I try to see the pictures from
their perspective and understand
what makes the boy seem unat-
tractive.

Searching for an explanation,
I look at his Facebook pictures
back through the awkward early
high school years...

Generally my friends are
right; the boy _ really isn’t that
cute. It’s his game that makes
him irresistible.

The ability to use words well
can make any boy attractive.

Here are some of the best and
worst lines that have been used
on me. You’re welcome to bor-
row, as long as you acknowledge
your source!

1. “I have a sister, so I un-
derstand your concern.”

Boys, this line is a winner.
There is nothing a girl wants
more than to be understood, and
there is nothing sexier than a guy

who is a good brother to his sis-
ter.

A boy I dated over the sum-
mer compared me to his sister.

“You dress like her, you enjoy
the same thing. You guys would
get along so well.”

When I would start to tell him
something, his jaw would drop,
“No, that’s so weird, you sound
like my sister.”

My heart would flutter so
much I had to lean over and kiss
him.

[Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum
Phi does not, for the most part,
promote incest.]

Guys with sisters have it easy.
For those who don’t have sisters,
try other lines.

2. “I don’t tell most girls
this, but....”.

Boys, don’t test this one. Even
though I may or may not have
fallen‘ for this line in the past, it’s
not original and most girls will
see right through it.

And, just a side note, if you
are trying to get with the sister of
a girl you’ve hooked up with in
the past, DO NOT use the same

lines...,especially not, “I don’t
tell this to most girls.” Sisters
talk, don’t blow your cover.

Another note: if you are two
brothers trying to get with two
sisters, do not share lines.

One boy said the sweetest
thing to my sister about how his
parents’ divorce forced him to
grow up. He used it to prove that
he was mature and would make a
dependable boyfriend.

It seemed so sincere I got
goose bumps when she shared it
with me — and then his brother
used the SAME line on me six
months later, adding that he was
especially responsible because
his older brother had “milked”
the divorce. Poor planning.

3. “I want you like a fat
boy wants cake.”

Yes this line has been used on
me. Pathetic. I wanted to scream,
“Do you mean ‘I love you like a
fat kid loves cake??’”

If you’re going to reference a
50 Cent song, don’t.

4. “Let’s just go by feel
and see what happens.”

This line might work if “go-

ing by feel" seemed even re-
motely like a good idea.

One thing boys seem to forget
is a little something called the
double standard.

Yes boys, you may not be
criticized for hooking up with 30
girls or eating 3 Big Macs, but if
I lived my life “going by feel”
I would probably weigh 300
pounds, have a couple of chil-
dren, a drug habit and a colorful
reputation.

5. Flattery works.

Anything along the lines of,
“You are so sexy,” “My friends
think you are so hot” or “You
have a banging body” will get
you far.

But don’t overdo it or the girl
may start feeling like she is too
good for you and ditch you for
the friend she knows likes her.

Beyond oral, don’t forget the
importance of carefully worded
texts.

Texting is a danger zone be-
cause, like your mom always
said, you can’t read “tone” off a
screen.

‘ An old boyfriend would send

me texts that I guess he thought
sounded cute, but actually sound-
ed feminine and emotional. For
example:

Me: “sweet dreams.”

The boyfriend: “I’ll dream
about you as long as you promise
to dream about me back :).”

It was especially annoying
because he didn’t realize how
obvious his motive was. Some
people just don’t know how to
use technology.

The truth is that lines are all
about delivery.

You can make a terrible line

The truth is that lines are all about delivery.

You can make a terrible line adorable with

a smile and alaugh acknowledging that you

sound like a huge tool.

And yes, he actually used the
smiley face.

Another error this boy made
was putting question marks at
the end of texts to ensure that I
would respond. This was a bad
choice because it always sound-
ed like he was giving me attitude.
For example:

“...make sense sorta?”

“. . .get it now?”

“. . .okay?”

adorable with a smile and a
laugh acknowledging that you
sound like a huge tool.

How else would I have ended
up making out with the boy who
wanted me like a fat boy wants
cake?

Oops! Good luck.

Republican party forges ahead in national elections

After two years of ineﬂective Democratic rule, the GOP looks to surge ahead this coming November

By John Paul Beall
STAFF WRITER

The last week of September
was marked by more signs that
the GOP is getting its mojo back,
as more and more polls indicate
that Republicans are closing in
on, if not leading their Demo-
cratic counterparts in both gov-
ernor and senator elections.

One exception to this trend
is the New York election, where
the Democratic candidates for
governor and senator, Rivers
Cuomo and Kirsten Gillibrand
respectively, lead their Repub-
lican opponents by over 10 per-

I cent. Outside the state of New

York, the GOP looks much more
comfortable.

It seems many of the Demo-
crats’ “safe haven” states are be-
ginning to shift toward the right,
with little to no ground move-
ment in the other direction.

The inﬂuential Democratic
Senator Russ Feingold of Wis-
consin is a good 12 percent be-
hind his Republican opponent
Ron Johnson, who is expected
to gain 54 percent of the vote.
Feingold’s lack of support shows
a striking lack of the coat—tail ef-
fect for the Obama administra-
tion.

California, the state often
hailed as one of the safest of the
Democratic Party’s strongholds

(besides “Senator Kennedy’s
Seat,” that is), is in danger of hav-
ing two Republican governors in
a row and losing one Democratic
senator, Barbara Boxer, to the
conservative Carly Fiorina, ex-
CEO of Hewlett-Packard.

Fiorina has been ‘essentially
tied with the incumbent Boxer,
ﬁghting over a seat that the
Democrats once believed to be
untouchable.

Meg Whitman, ex—CEO of
eBay, is running as the GOP’s
gubenatorial candidate against
former governor and current
Attorney General Jerry Brown,
who hopes to become both the
youngest and oldest governor in
California history. .

Whitman had been leading
Brown in the polls until recently,
when Democrats attempted to
tarnish the campaign’s reputa-
tion by claiming that Whitman
had knowingly hired an illegal
immigrant as a housekeeper.

To make their case, Demo-
crats brought in star chaser attor-
ney Gloria Allred to defend the
cleaning woman, who had pre-
sented a falsiﬁed Social Security
card and driver’s license to the
cleaning agency Whitman used
to hire her. .

The Nevada State Senate rac-

es are also neck-and-neck as Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid
pulls out all the stops to keep
from being ousted by Republi-
can Sharron Angle, who boasts

considerable support from the _

constitutionally literalist wing of

in campaign his numbers are ex-
pected to increase. In all likeli-
hood, splitting the Republican
vote will leave Coons with the
win.

In the high-profile Florida
elections, the governor seat is

won because of backlash to the Bush adminis-

tration, a base they took for granted, is begin-

ning to falter.

the GOP, the Tea Party.

The race is currently 48 to 47
percent in Reid’s favor. Reid is
the third inﬂuential Democratic
senator to come to crosshairs in
the polls.

Of course, we all saw the SNL
sketch lampooning the Repub-
lican candidate for Delaware’s
Senate seat, Christine O’Donnell,
for dabbling with witchcraft.

Nevertheless, she still sits
only nine points behind Demo-
crat Chris Coons. Republican
Mike Castle, a long—time Con-
gressman for Delaware who lost
the primary to O’Donnell, cur-
rently has 5 percent of the vote.

However, if he begins a write-

practically tied between Republi-
can and Democratic candidates.

The Florida senate election
draws particular attention as
Republican Marco Rubio con-
tinues to control the race with
a remarkable ll-point lead on
independent Charlie Crist and
20-point lead on Democrat Ken-
drick Meek.

Statistics are also starting to
work against the Democrats:
23 percent of Colorado citizens
count themselves believers in the
Tea Party Movement, and for the
second month in a row there is an
all—time low in citizens who con-
sider themselves Democrats.

On Oct. l, a Rasmussen Re-

port indicated that the Demo-
crats’ customary advantage
over Republican voter turnout
is dwindling. At this point two
years ago, 39 percent of Ameri-
cans counted themselves Demo-
crats compared to a Republican
33.4 percent.

Last year, Democrats counted
for 37.5 percent of Americans,
compared to the Republican 32.1
percent. This year, 34.6 percent
of Americans consider them-
selves Democrats, compared to a
Republican 33.1 percent.

If the trend of Democratic
voter apathy continues, Republi-
cans will reap the beneﬁts in the
mid-term elections. ’

The change in party alle-
giance is also a wake-up call to
the Democratic elites in OTTICC
that the general population is
growing tired of tax-and-spend
initiatives, such as the gargan-
tuan health care bill.

Projections predict that after
the elections, Democrats will
control 49 Senate seats, to the
GOP’s 47, leaving 4 non-affili-
ated.

The House of Representatives

_holds more dismal tidings for

Democrats. A Rasmussen poll
reports that 46 percent of respon-
dents who expect to vote this

November said that they would
sooner vote for the Republican in
their district; 40 percent said they
would vote for the Democrat.
Among independents, Repub-
licans hold a 14 percent lead over
Democrats. Independents are a
group on whom Democrats have

generally‘ counted to swing elec-

tions their way.

It appears that the reliable
power base the Democrats won
because of backlash to the Bush
administration is beginning to
falter.

So now it is time for Presi-
dent Obama to reassess his strat-
egy from resting on the liberal
order’s laurels to embracing the
general resurgence of conserva-
tism in America.

After all, we are overdue for
a one-term president. As a matter
of fact, the only time in presiden-
tial history that there have been
three two term Presidents in a
row was the reign of Jefferson,
Madison and Monroe.

With Obama posing to be-
come a lame duck in his ﬁrst
term, this does not bode well for
his Judgment Day in 2012.

It’s that time of the year again.
No—not rush or watching Ala-

Between conservative and liberal divisions in both major parties, a new party knocking out

entrenched incumbents across the nation, and the highly contentious and emotional issues of

healthcare, tax, and military policy at stake, this midterm season is going to be one of the most

signiﬁcant in recent history.

Taking its name from the
Boston Tea Party of 1773, the
modern Tea Party movement is
generally characterized as a po-
litically conservative populist
movement.

Loose organizations and lo-
cal chapters generally opposed
to larger levels of taxation, gov-
ernment spending and business

noying, I think they have made
the last two years of politics a lot
more fun to watch.

With antics like sending tea
bags to Washington and ﬂocking
to rather silly rallies with keynote
speakers such as political antago-
nist Glen Beck, the Tea Party has
certainly mixed up the traditional
two-party landscape.

grievances the party has raised.

While American history has
shown us that third parties rarely
manage to survive on any ma-
jor scale, it is not outside of the
realm of possibilities to imagine
the Tea Party gaining enough mo-
mentum to propel several of their
candidates to victory this fall.

Theﬁght between the GOP
and the Democrats is typically
pretty good, but this year, the
mudslinging will really not be
one to miss.

Battle lines have been drawn
for years. Since President Obama
took ofﬁce, the GOP has been
gearing up for this election sea-
son, fundraising like crazy and
attempting to attract candidates
who bring in voters from outside
the traditional conservative base.

The Obama wave that swept
the nation in 2008 brought in
many Democrats from tradition-
ally conservative districts. These
conservative Democrats, known
by many as “Blue Dogs,” are go-
ing to be hard-pressed to defend
the agenda the Obama adminis-
tration has put forth.

In particular, many of these
Blue Dogs will be susceptible to
attack on the grounds that they
do not really represent the true
political inclinations of their dis-
tricts.

Democratic congressmen

across America are being forced
to take one of two positions: ei-

him with harsh cries that those in
the Democratic base are “just sit-
ting on their hands,” and that “it
is inexcusable for any Democrat
or progressive right now to stand
on the sidelines in this midterm
election.”

Obama is giving us some
measure of the division with
which Democratic leadership is
struggling. Is this the best way to
raise a depressed base’s motiva-
tion in a tough election year? By
yelling at them?

I’m not sure that talking down
to your voters is the best way
to raise turnout, but what do I
know?

Between conservative and
liberal divisions in both major
parties; a new party knocking out
entrenched incumbents across
the nation; and the highly con-
tentious and emotional issues
of health care, tax and military
policy at stake, this midterm sea-
son is going to be one ofthe most
signiﬁcant in recent history.

With the potential to alter the
political landscape as much as
the I994 midterms, the stakes for
both parties couldn’t be higher.

This no-holds-barred brawl
between the exhausted and the
enraged will show the true colors
of both parties, and will make for
some excellent entertainment for
the rest of us.

Study Abroad Fair last Thursday encourages students to be global citizens across the globe

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

Lastweek, Washington and
Lee sponsored the Study Abroad
Fair in an effort to showcase the
University’s own -international
education offerings, as well as
outside programs and compa-
nies. Twenty different booths
representing various organiza-
tions were displayed at the fair
where students had the opportu-
nity to browse, pick up brochures
and chat with representatives
from the study abroad outlets.
Representatives talked about
how to incorporate study abroad
with their curricula and offered
insight about the merits of inter-
national education.

The Study Abroad Fair fea-
tured opportunities to study
all over the world, which over
half of all W&L undergraduates

choose to do. One of the com-
panies, Intemational Education
of Students (IES), provides 80

, programs in 31 countries. Sea

Semester offers a unique expe-
rience living aboard a ship and
studying environmental science,
public policy and culture for a
semester while also awarding 17
credits from Boston University.
Each program provides mul-
tiple courses to satisfy a range of
major requirements, and many of
the companies are able to tailor a
set of courses to individual stu-
dents. Another company present
at the fair was the School for In-
ternational Training, which spe-
cializes in hands-on interaction
within the foreign community
and incorporates an extended
home-stay with educational ex-

periences, seminars and ﬁeld-
work for true immersion into the
foreign culture.

Whether a student is looking
for a home-stay, an internship,
an intensive language course or
ﬁeldwork, the Center for Intema-
tional Education at W&L can ac-
commodate the student internally
or ﬁnd the right program to sat-
isfy the student’s needs. For ex-
ample, W&L has partnered with
St. Andrew’s in Scotland to offer
pre-med students the chance to
study abroad while still fulﬁlling
all of the lab and science require-
ments.

There are some W&L require-
ments for study abroad, includ-
ing a cumulative GPA of at least
2.5, departmental permission for
coursework and country-appro-

priate foreign language ﬂuency,
but the university aims to assist
all students in planning a trip that
is conducive to their major and
their interests. W&L has devel-
oped many of its own trips and
programs to facilitate transfer-
ring credits and major require-
ments. Spring Term now offers
more study abroad courses, with
trips to Costa Rica, Tanzania,
Spain and China, among others.
The CIE can also place students
for fall term, winter term and
summer programs.

The CIE can also arrange
internships and work abroad
opportunities for students who
wish to do outside work in con-
junction with their studies. Some
of the more popular jobs held
abroad are teaching, professional

internships and volunteering.
Studying abroad is very im-

portant to the University’s ad-

ministration: it is implementing
a two-year strategic initiative to
ensure the development of new
programs. The University aims,
through the mission statement of
the CIE, to “create an elfective
global learning environment by
providing leadership, adminis-
trative oversight and broad sup-
port for international learning
and global engagement.”

The center also aims to help
students apply for university
grants, country-speciﬁc grants
and scholarships from outside
sources. Students who receive
Johnson Opportunity Grants are
able to use this scholarship to
plan summer trips abroad to work -

   Fair brings opportunities to travel the world

and study in a new environment.
Last summer, six W&L students
used their grants to travel and to
ﬁt their academic interests.

W&L’s study abroad offerings
are numerous, and the Center for
International Education can help
students to arrange the perfect
trip for each student.

“Cheese Louise” celebrates art collection

The Reeves Center hosted its biannual event honoring artist Louise Herreshoff Reeves

By Mary Helen Turnage
STAFF WRITER

Cheese, art and conversa-
tion were in abundance this past
Thursday evening at the Reeves
Center during the biannual event,
Cheese Louise. Since 2005, the
Reeves Center has held this affair
for students and faculty in order
to showcase the artwork of Lou-
ise Herreshoff Reeves. Though
the spring Cheese Louise has
been happening annually since
2005, this is only the second year
that there has been a fall event.

The spring Cheese Louise
offers wine, while the fall event
offers sparkling cider and other

nonalcoholic beverages. Katie
Gardner, curatorial assistant at
the Reeves Center, said the cen-
ter organized a fall version of
Cheese Louise so that everyone
at W&L, including those under
21, could enjoy the experience.
Many younger students know
nothing about the Reeves Center,
so this affair provides an excel-
lent opportunity for them to get
to know this educational center
for the arts that is right on cam-
pus.

According to Gardner, W&L
owns about 160 works of Lou-

ise Herreshoff Reeves. Born in,

I876, Reeves studied at the Aca-
démie Julian in Paris. She mar-
ried Euchlin Dalcho Reeves, a
1927 graduate of W&L Law. The
Reeves donated a remarkable
amount of Chinese l8th- and
19th-century porcelain as well as
many of Louise’s impressionist-
style paintings. Though she died
in 1967, her legacy lives on in
her artwork.

Along with the beautiful
paintings, guests enjoyed deli-
cious hors-d’oeuvres and des-
serts. The food included crab

tartlets, mushroom tartlets and
vegetables with Roquefort dip.
Also at the food table were all
sorts of cheese: buttermilk bleu
afﬁnée, MezzaLuna fontina,
Grand Cru Gruyere Reserve and
red spruce cheddar. Local apple
cider, orange pineapple punch
and ice water were provided
for beverages. And for dessert?
Cheesecake, of course!

The event had a great turnout
of students and professors who
conversed over Reeves’ paint-
ings.

“Cheese Louise was such an

eye-opening experience,” said
sophomore Camie Carlock. “It
was my ﬁrst time to attend the
reception, and I was blown away.
The food was delicious, and I
loved getting to mingle with
friends and professors in such a
sophisticated setting.”

Though the focus of the event
was on the art, many non-art
major students also enjoyed the
event.

Senior business and econom-
ic major Skip Wood said: “The
event was a nice change of pace
from the average grind of the

Williams School activities. The
food was great and I really en-
joyed the art exhibits.”

For more information on
Reeves, view her artwork dis-
played in the Reeves Center next
to Tucker Hall or attend the next
Cheese Louise this spring.

Gender inequality still a challenge in academia

Four regional professors participate in a public reading from their collection “Feminist Activism in Academia ”

By Collins Rice
STAFF WRITER

One wouldn’t expect a call
for gender equality in the aca-
demic sector to be revolutionary.
However, the tone of Monday’s

- reading of Feminist Activism in

Academia.‘ Essays on Person-

_al, Political, and Professional

Change was one that called at-
tention to the need for closer ex-
amination of the current state of
gender politics in academia.
Hosted by the colleetion’s
co-editor, Washington and Lee’s

Professor of Romance Lan-
guages Ellen Mayock, the event
included readings from four ‘of
the collection’s contributors:
Mayock’s co-editor and Profes-
sor of Romance Languages and
Chair of the Women and Gender
Studies, Domnica Radulescu,
Professor of Politics Robin LeB-
lanc and Hollins University’s
Vice-President of Academic Af-
fairs Jeanine Silveira Stewart.
The collection’s essays span a

range of subject matter, includ-
ing reproductive rights, moth-
ering language in the academic
workplace and gender-based
discrimination in classroom and
administrative settings.

In reading a selection from her
piece, “Get Out of My Uterus! A
Manifesto against Reproductive
Politics in the Academic World
and in the World at Large,” Rad-
ulescu drew upon her experiences
living in communist-era Romania

in order to illustrate the potential
violence of policies that regulate
women’s bodies. The fundamen-
tal right to choice and reproduc-
tive freedom, Radulescu asserts,
should not be a matter of public
discourse, but accepted for its
status as an inalienable right. In
her home country, 10,000 people
died as a result of draconic re-
productive laws, emboldening
Radlescu to echo the feminist
mantra, “I shouldn’t have to be
here,” indicating the obvious
danger of a totalitarian restric-
tion of reproductive rights.

In her selection, “Teaching .to
Spite Your Body,” LeBlanc re-
counted her struggle to be taken
seriously in an academic area
historically dominated by men.
As the only woman in the poli-
tics department, LeBlanc wrote,
she worked hard to seem less
feminine in order to gain respect
from both her fellow professors
and by her students. In addition,
LeBlanc stated the fact that fe-
male professors are sometimes
threatened simply because they
are women. At times in her ca-
reer, she confessed, this threat
encouraged her to disguise gen-
der differences in the same man-
ner against which she cautions
her students.

Stewart of University dis-
cussed discrimination against
mothers in professional settings
in a reading from her piece,
“Mothering out of Place: Decon-
structing the Maternal Wall in
Academia.” She illustrated the
underrepresentation of women
and mothers on the tenure track
at four-year universities, as well
was the differing effect parent-
hood has on the career trajecto-
ries of men and women. Although
men and women are almost
equally represented in graduate
schools, the same cannot be said
for professorship. Stewart also’
highlighted the disparity with
which parenthood is perceived
in considering those of different
genders for employment: while
mothers are popularly perceived
to lack the ability to perform at
the highest level professionally,
fathers are more employable in
academia than non-fathers.

Mayock closed the reading
with a selection from her piece,
“Mothering Language in the
Academic Workplace.” She ex-
pressed the importance of hav-
ing both accomplished men and
women in the “front ofﬁce” in
administration of academic in-
stitutions. The prevalence, she
says, of the terms “mom” and

 

“mommy” attached to other
terms~“Soccer mom,” “Ser-
geant mom,” “Hockey mom”——
gives the impression that women
do not belong in the workplace.
Such an idea, Mayock postu-
lated, ﬁirther perpetuates the
deeply ingrained ideas of moth-
ers’ capabilities. She encouraged
universities to be more aware of
language and its implications.

In regard to the Feminist Ac-
tivism in Academia, Jill Dolan,
Director of the Program in the
Study of Women and Gender
at Princeton University, wrote,
“This collection clariﬁes the vex-
ations of trying to be an ethical
professor, an honorable human
being and a woman, in a context
in which ‘female’ and ‘academic’
are too often oxymoronic.” The
book is available in the campus
bookstore and online for $55.

The Generals place 9th out of 3 6, leaving rival Bridgewater in the dust

The women’s cross country team trav-
elled to Lehigh University in Bethlehem,
Pa., on Saturday for the Paul Short Invita-
tional, a huge and highly competitive meet
thatover 4,000 college and high school
runners attended. The Generals ﬁnished
9th out 0f36 teams in their race, narrowly
beating out ODAC rival Bridgewater Col-
lege. Sophomore Lauren Schultz ﬁnished
ﬁrst for Washington and Lee in 36th over-
all with a time of24:02.

The excitement was high within the
team before the race. “I don’t think l’ve
been this nervous for a meet since high
school,” admitted sophomore Louisa

Phillips of Charleston, S.C. “The course

looks good though,” Phillips added. Only
ten members were selected from W&L’s
squad of 22 to attend this meet, known for
its high entry numbers and fast course.
Lehigh’s level, grassy course was heav-
ily affected by the previous week’s rain,
and parts of the course were turned into

wallows of ankle-deep mud. “It wasn’t too
terrible, but some of the corners were pret-
ty messy,” said team top-ﬁnisher Schultz
after the race. Before the race, sopho-
more Molly Ortiz of Ketchikan, Alaska,

‘predicted that the muddy course would
probably have a negative impact on times '

but would turn out to be “an advantage to
us as a team” since the team is known to
do “best in challenging conditions.” The
W&L home course is considered one of
the toughest in the ODAC, giving the team
the advantage of training on difﬁcult ter-
rain.

The muddy course still produced some
fast ﬁnishes. First-year Annelise Madi-
son of Roca, Neb., clocked an impressive
24:08. She was closely followed by senior
captain Katherine Fenwick of Berwyn,
Pa., in 24:28.

“I think it’s great we came to such a
competitive meet; there were over 400
teams here,” Fenwick commented post-

race. She was pleased that within the team
“everyone really pulled their weight and
really stepped it up.” The fast course and
cool weather were deﬁnitely positive fac-
tors, and the positive effects of several
weeks of tough training showed in the
W&L runners. After the race Fenwick not-
ed, “We all did a great job pushing, each
other; everyone ran a season best." All of
the W&_L runners were among the top 70
ﬁnishers of their 280-runner ﬁeld.

The team’s performance overall

was impressive in such a large group of *

schools. ‘‘I’m really excited. I think we
did a great job out there,” commented
Coach Kris Hoey. Hoey was particularly
impressed with the team members’ ability
to ﬁnd each other on the course and work
together. “Our top ﬁve all ﬁnished within
63 seconds of each other. That’s really in-
credible.” The Generals will race again on
October 16 at the Gettysburg Invitational.

Generals score big

W&L and Coach Miriello get record-setting win over Guilford, 55 - 29

By Jordy Stern
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Generals out-
paced the Quakers of Guilford College
55-29 on Saturday, making history in the
process. Not only did the Generals score
the most points in a game since 1962, but
they also gave Coach Frank Miriello a
coaching milestone. With Saturday’s vic-
tory, Coach Miriello now holds the record
for most wins in W&L football history, a
mark held previously by Gary Fallon. The
emphatic 77th win of Coach Miriello’s
career showcased plenty of Generals’ of-
fensive ﬁrepower, with 545 total yards
compiled against Guilford.

Though the Quakers were ﬁrst on the
board with Tyler Hall’s 27-yard ﬁeld goal,

the Generals struck back on the next pos-
session as Brett Murray scored on a Char-
lie Westfal pass for W&L’s ﬁrst touch-
down of the game. Guilford running back
Mike Williams took the lead back in the
second quarter with a 23-yard touchdown
run. This would prove to be the last time
the Quakers had the privilege of leading
the Generals in Saturday’s game. Harri-
son Hudson brought the ball into the end
zone twice in the second quarter, reclaim-
ing W&L control of the scoreboard once
and for all.

Amplifying the ﬁrst half’s offensive
production, the Generals racked up ﬁve
second-half touchdowns, including three

unanswered in the third quarter. Despite
two scores put up the by the Quakers in
the fourth quarter, the Generals ended the
game with a comfortable 36-point margin
of victory. Individually, the Generals’ vic-
tory was propelled by several outstanding
performances. Murray led the offense with
three total touchdowns, two rushing and

one receiving. Luke Heinsohn surpassed

the century mark for the third consecutive
game, rushing for 223 yards, the most by
a W&L player since 2001. The Generals
and their high-powered offense return to
Wilson Field this Saturday to face Emo-
ry & Henry for the 2010 Homecoming
