’ Residents lose everything, but remain unharmed
- Stockton Bullitt has eyewitness report

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR. EYEWITNESS

A student house at 232 Furrs Mill_

Road in Lexington burned down on
Sunday night, Mar. 20th. The house,
otherwise known as “Pole 2," housed
six Washington and Lee senior women.
No one was at the house when the ﬁre
started, and none were in the injured in
the ﬁre.

According to multiple sources, the
ﬁre started a little after 8 p.m. below
the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the house. Within min-
utes, the entire house was completely
engulfed in ﬂames. Flames extended t_o
twenty to thirty feet above the house.
The ﬂames could be seen from clearly
from the Route ll Bridge. The ﬂames
were even visible from campus.

The origin of the ﬁre is currently un-
known. However, the ﬂames appeared
very strong‘ and powerful. They were
so strong that they blew a power line
near to the house, cutting off power to
the rest of the pole houses. A student’s
car underneath the pole house was lost
to the ﬁre.

A neighbor to Pole 2, an eyewitness
to the ﬁre, did not notice the ﬁre until
approximately ten minutes after the ﬁre

started. After he and his roommates
evacuated their house, they called the
Lexington Fire Department, who had al-
ready been notiﬁed about the ﬁre.

Around 8:15, the Lexington and
Buena Vista Fire Department arrived at
the scene. The armada of ﬁre trucks then
spent the next hour putting out the rag-
ing ﬁre at the scene. After half an hour
of spraying water at the roaring ﬂames,
the ﬁre departments were ﬁnally able to
quell most of the ﬂames by around 8:45,
when the roof collapsed.

For most of the ﬁre’s duration, a
group of about ﬁfty W&L students gath-
ered on Furrs Mill Road to watch. Al-
though ambulances arrived quickly to
the scene, no students were injured by
the ﬁre or by any consequences of the
ﬁre. News sources were also quick on
the scene ﬁlming the situation at hand.

Students at the surrounding pole
houses were evacuated from their
houses, while the situation was being
resolved.

If you would like to help out, please bring donations of clothes

to your next chapter meeting or to your Greek house ASAP.

 

’ W&L feels tremors from Japan’s quake  

Students, professors and alumni all aﬂected by the events halfway across the world; relief fund set up by organizations

By Emily Mosh
smrr WRITER

For more than a week, the world has

watched Japan ﬁght against the worst.

natural disaster in the country’s history.
Even Washington and Lee in Lexington,
Va. isn’t immune to its effects.

By now, everyone on campus likely
knows the approximate death toll after
the earthquake and tsunami hit the small
island country—8,000. Everyone has
heard about the ongoing nuclear crisis.
Everyone, however, might not know
about the personal effects the event has
had on members of the W&L commu-
nity. Not only do students and faculty
have familymembers and loved ones
in Japan, but two recent alumni are cur-
rently living and working there.

John Henzel, ‘I0, is in a teaching
program stationed in Japan. He is there
with his wife, Beth Valentine Henzel,
a member of the class of 20ll who
graduated early. Though he could not
be reached for an interview directly,
Henzel did post a note on his Facebook

I S ‘ page days after the earthquake struck. It

 

was his way of answering the hundreds

' of questions he knew he’d receive in the

upcoming weeks about his experience.

. “My experiences were relatively
mundane,” he wrote. “I never had to
evacuate or anything, and mostly just
had to put up with being without utili-
ties for a little while.”

In his note, Henzel said the hard-
est part now is that several of the local
stores are still closed and getting such
necessities asdrinking water is difﬁcult.
The school he’s been teaching at has
been particularly helpful, though, both
to the Henzels and to its students. It has
been serving as a shelter and has been
offering food and water to those who
need it.

The disaster has also affected stu-
dents and professors on campus.-

I

Sophomore Vera Higgs has family
in Japan. Her 97-year-old grandmother
lives in Tokyo, as do four of her aunts
and their families. One other aunt lives
even closer to the center of the disaster.

“I called my mother as soon as I
heard the news,” said Higgs. “[She]
was desperately trying to get a hold of
my family...l believe one of the worst
feelings in life is that of not knowing;
not only is it unbelievably frustrating,
but also overwhelmingly frightening.”

Higgs’s mother was able to make
contact with one of her sisters in Japan.
One of Higgs’s aunts was in a shelter,
and her grandmother’s house had caved
in. ‘Though shaken, they were all safe.

Mary Knighton, a visiting assistant

professor of Japanese, received news of
the earthquake and tsunami on Friday
morning through an email news alert.
Her husband, Scott Gold, is an archi-
tect who is currently running his ﬁrm’s
Japan ofﬁce in Tokyo. She was luckily
able to contact him by Skype that mom-
ing. '
“We looked together at the news
and terrifying images of the tsunami,”
she said. “Time and space just shrunk,
and the planet seemed very fragile and
small—my home here in Lexington si-
multaneously connected with my hus-
band at his worksite in Tokyo.”

Knighton made it to her 8 a.m. class,
though she said she was shaky the whole
day. She constantly checked for updates
and watched live streaming videos.

“Eerily enough, in disasters, the peo-
ple right there sometimes cannot see the
bigger picture that family and others are
seeing via television on the other side of
the country, even the world,” she said.

Knighton said she could see the de-
struction and devastation the tsunami
had left all over Japan on every channel

and website she visited, while her hus-
band and his colleagues had only their
small ofﬁce television set to receive in-
formation.

“By Saturday late afternoon, 1 was
thoroughly depressed and worried de-
spite having spoken to Scott,” Knighton
said. Her husband had assured herithat
he was ﬁne, facing only inconveniences.

Knighton said her husband has re-
ceived several emails from friends over-
seas concerned about the nuclear crisis
and asking him when he intended on
leaving.

“He had no intention or thought of
leaving at this stage,” she explained,
despite her husband noting that several
foreigners iniJapan had already started
ﬂeeing the area. “Panic can be danger-
ous and exacerbate an already crisis
situation.”

Knighton said she knew she had to
do something to distract herself from
worrying. She quickly contacted stu-
dent groups to ask for help in setting up
a relief fund for Tohoku.

“Within the hour, SAIL had started
organizing and even getting a poster
made,” she said, calling them “compas-
sionate about the cause and eager to be
part ofthe solution.” Soon, PAACE and
other organizations were helping too.

There is a table in Elrod Commons

taking donations for the relief effort,.

with money going to the Japanese Red
Cross. Also, There will be a panel of
East Asian Studies professors and His-
tory Department professors leading a
discussion about the crisis next Wednes-
day at noon.

Kickballfor
a cause

Philanthropy event
supports CASA

By Lizz Dye
STAFF wrmza

LIZZ DYE / staff writer

Ten teams from various organi-
zations participated in Theta’s
kickball tournament Saturday.

A Kappa Alpha Theta hosted their second
annual “Kicks for CASA” on Fuge Field
last Saturday. Ten teams participated with
participation from various fraternities and
sororities on campus.

CASA, which stands for “Court Ap-
pointed Special Advocates,” is a national
network of 1,000 program offices that are
recruiting, training and supporting volun-
teers to represent abused and neglected
children in the courtroom and other set-
tings.

Senior Lauren Bohdan is a certiﬁed
CASA. She said her experience has taught
her important lessons about both law and
social services.

“I feel like I understand the problems
with the foster care process and system
and can be useful in making it work more
effectively,” Bohdan said.

Emily Zankman, Theta’s philanthropy
chair, ran the event. According to Zank-
man, over $3000 were raised for CASA.

“It was the perfect day for a kickball
tournament, the competition was ﬁerce,
and the donations were plentiful. It was a
greatsuccess,” Zankman said.

The winning team, composed mostly of
Washington and Lee soccer players, won
a $100 gift certiﬁcate to Macado’s. Sweet
Things, Frank’s, and the Livery also do-
nated gift cards for rafﬁe prizes.

    

Registration redux: the new system’s big test "

Seniors begin registration this week while students wonder the new system will work

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The new WebAdvisor registration
software will be tested this week as stu-
dents begin the first round of registra-
tion for the upcoming fall term.

Registration for seniors begins at
7:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 22.

The new registration software that
will be used was implemented during
spring term registration of this year,
but now students will be registering for
four or ﬁve courses instead of just one.

Some students had a relatively
seamless spring term registration ex-
perience, but others were not so lucky.
Freshman Melissa Campion said she
thought spring term registration was
going to be easy. All she had to do was
register for her study abroad class in
Costa Rica.

But Campion said she had to try to
register on three different computers
before the new web registration pro-
gram would process her request.

Campion said she did not want to
have another stressful registration ex-
perience, so she attended last Friday’s
web registration information session,
led by University Registrar Scott Dit-
tman. A total of four students attended
the session.

Why the switch?

Dittman said that his office was re-

ceiving a lot of pressure from students
to switch to a system in which they
could pick their own course times.

The students’ requests and the fact
that the old web registration software
was 13 years old contributed to the
university’s decision to implement the
new registration software. The new
web registration software was studied
for about two and a half years, Ditt-
man said, and has been used at the law
school before.

Thanks to the new software, stu-
dents’ schedules will now be built
around speciﬁc sections of courses.
Gone are the days when the Registrar’s
Ofﬁce would sort students into sections
that would ﬁt their schedule—students
now have to decide on their own which
section of a course they want sign up
for.

The drop/add process will also
change. The new system makes it all
electronic. Students will no longer
need to run around with those blue
sheets of paper trying to get signatures.

Passwords have also been eliminat-
ed. Instead of having to get a password
from their adviser and keep it safe until
their registration window opens, stu-
dents will now receive an email from
their [adviser informing them that they
have been given permission to regis-
ter. Again, the paper component of this

 E

 

l\ Yb’li‘ll_..lil‘

process has been eliminated.
What could go wrong

One of the biggest problems that
Dittman sees with the new registration
process is that the software on WebAd-
visor does not provide all of the details
about the courses that it lists, such as
prerequisites required for the course.
In order to obtain full course informa-
tion, students need to go to the course
offerings section of the Registrar’s
website, making it even more impor-
tant that students plan for registration
in advance, Dittman said.

‘The new waiting list process, which
will actually begin after regular regis-
tration is complete, is another aspect
of registration that could potentially be
problematic, according to Dittman.

“We’re still kind of fooling with this
to ﬁnd the best way to do it,” said Dit-
tman.

Waiti-ng lists will now be ap-
proached on a student-by-student basis.
If a ‘spot in a course opens up, emails
will be sent out to one student at a time
offering them a chance to go online and
remove their name from a waiting list
and enroll in a course.

“That seat offer is. yours and yours
alone until the time runs out,” Dittman

. said.

     
 

  
 

H
r’

These emails will be time sensitive,
typically giving a student 24 hours to
take action and enroll in a class. But
the emails will only be sent out Monday
through Thursday, so students will not

have to worry about constantly check- _

ing their’ email over the weekends.
Dittman said that the new waiting list
process will stay open all summer long,
providing ample time for students to

change their mind about courses and/or

get off of waiting lists.

While the new registration software
offers beneﬁts to students, it also re-
quires that they take some time to get
acclimated to the system.

“It requires more work on our part,”
said current junior Frank Cullo as he
scrolled through the list of politics
courses available for him to take next
fall. Cullo said that he had already
tried to make a preferred course list
once, but the registration software gave
him nothing but error messages. He
had to wait a few days and try again.

WebAdvisor registration process, in-
cluding 'a schedule of registration
times, can be found on the Registrar’s

' These shoes ruIe...These shoes suck

W&L women are not creative when it comes to shoe fashion, but is fashion really the only reason to buy shoes?

By Ali Greenberg
C0 LU M N I ST

Girls like shoes,just like fat kids like
cake or Kobe Bryant likes hotel con-
cierges. (Allegedly.)

In fact, surveys show that Ameri-
_can women on average have 17 pairs of
shoes.

I personally own 13 pairs of TOMS
alone, but I did intern for them and am
a sucker for charity shopping. Well,
for shopping in general. And shoes. It
comes with being female middle class
and white.

So in my opinion, and this is an opin-
ions column after all, a shoe article has
been a long time coming. However, I
wasn’t sure how I wanted to approach
the topic until my deadline itself was
approaching, and I remembered a recent
Spanish class.

On a recent abnonnally warm spring
day, in between learning about la prim-
era y segunda republica, I was staring at
my feet overcome with the hazy feeling
of aftemoon sunshine and the chirping

’ of the birds far outside of DuPont’s as-

bestos riddled walls. (Allegedly.)

Soon I carried my gaze around the
classroom ﬂoor, and spotted the follow-
ing: Uggs, Cowboy Boots, Frye Boots,
Rainbows, Tory .

phenomenon in one of your classes,
chances are you have. Chances are you
are wearing one of those types of shoes

right now.

each type of shoe, I decided that I actu-
ally wanted to use the rest of this space
to talk about something that is actually,
well, important.

As mentioned

Burch’s. Clarks Wal-
labees, New Balanc-
es and Sperry’s.

Since it" wasn’t
raining, we were
missing Hunter’s and
Bean Boots, and giv-
en the calendar, Jack
Rogers would have
been about as aggres-
sive as the chick that
took off her pants at
Das Klub.

Honestly, thejokes write themselves.

here because every female in the class
was wearing one of the above varieties;
it was like a real life fun house where
every irony I have ever thought about
came true!

Maybe you have observed a similar

It is sometimes diﬁeult to remember how
lucky we are when our biggest issue is
which pair of overpriced ballet ﬂats go
better with our summer shift dress.

VI want to be clear that there is no
shame in this, not even in wearing Uggs,
which are really just bundles of warmth,
lambs and clouds enveloping your feet
with love. Shoes are a highly personal
choice and whatever you choose is ﬁne

by me.
But because it is boring to go through

previously, I own a
borderline obscene
amount of TOMS
shoes. However, I
did not become inter-
ested in these shoes
because they are
stylish, but because
they actually help the

world.
If you aren’t
familiar with the

TOMS model, their motto is very sim-
ple: One for One. This means that for
each pair of shoes a customer buys,
TOMS will donate a pair of shoes to a
child in need.

It is sometimes diﬁicult to remember
how lucky we are when our biggest is-
sue is which pair of overpriced ballet

ﬂats go better with our summer shift
dress. However, for much of the world,
whether or not they have shoes in gen-
eral is the real concern.

. If the world ‘were a village of 100
people, 40 of them would have no shoes
and in much of the third world, walking
is the primary mode of transportation,
often on unpaved and underdeveloped
streets.

And much like the dance ﬂoors on
Windfall, the water that covers these

' streets is infested with parasites. Being

barefoot in these conditions opens the
door for cuts, infection and disease.

I guess my point is, before you look
into your closet and think you have
nothing to wear, remember how privi-
leged you and your ugly shoes are.

Also, Virginia Tech got screwed in _

the NCAA Tournament. Not allegedly.

New album does not live up to former glory

Jon Salm forgets that 2002 was nine years ago and reviews the album “Angles” by rock band The Strokes

ByJon Salm
COLUMNIST

Dear The Strokes,

Hey guys, how have you been? I’m
sure the ﬁve years you’ve spent since
First Impressions of Earth have served
you well. Albert, I really enjoyed your
two solo records. I couldn’t wait to hear
more of those jangly, simplistic pop
tunes. Julian, your own solo release left
something to be desired, but it was great
to ﬁnally hear that snarl again (even if
it sounded more like l980’s Miami than
tum-of-the-millennium Manhattan).

Nick, Nikolai, and Fabrizio - I know
you all spent the break working on the
guitar riff to the next “Last Nite,” the
bass line to the next “Reptillia,” and the
drum into to the next “The Way It Is.”

So, what the hell happened?

The Strokes were supposed to be
the saviors of Rock n’ Roll, for Christ’s
sake! You hit the stage with such ven-
geance, such swagger, such pure, un-
adulterated tenacity that you were im-
possible to ignore. You were the darlings
of the New York music scene. You were

the hippest of the hip, the coolest of the
cool. You were the kings of the lower
east side. Your songs were described as
a mix of“punky brevity and gnarly faux
simplicity.” But on

Is This It. However, this is clearly not
the case.

Angles is an unfocused mix ofvintage
garage rock and failed experimentation.

tunately, those are the only two tracks
on par with anything else in your back

catalog.
The rest of the album sounds like a
good band that has

your newest record,
Angles, it sounds like
you’re lost.

Angles is unlike
anything you have
done before, but is
unmistakably a re-
cord by The Strokes.
There are intricate-
ly linked guitars,
steady, pounding
bass lines, and Julian
Casablancas’ signa-
ture baritone. But at
the same time, this is not The Strokes
that I know.

After a mid-career misstep on your
last record, you promised a return to
form on Angles. “Rolling Stone” even
declared Angles your best record since
your slick and self-assured 2001 debut,

ignore.

The Strokes were supposed to be the
saviors of Rock n ’Roll, for Christis sake!
You hit the stage with such vengeance,
such swagger, such pure, unadulterated
tenacity that you were impossible to

When your return to your roots works, it
works well. Lead single “Under Cover
of Darkness” could ﬁt in seamlessly on
any ofyour releases, and “Life is Simple
in the Moonlight” has a surging chorus
that could ignite any crowd. Both are
sharp, catchy and charismatic. Unfor-

lost its way. “Gratis-
faction” has a saccha-
rine hook but quickly
falls into a repetitive
trap. The opening
guitar riff on “Me-
tabolism” echoes the
main riff of “Elec-
tricityscape,” one of
the weaker tracks on
First Impressions.
Don’t even get me
started on the Carib-
bean drumbeats of
“Games” or the failed Coldplay imita-
tion on “Call Me Back.” Were you even
trying?

On previous releases, your band op-
erated under a sort of advantageous dic-
tatorship under Casablancas’ leadership.
Despite this, you opted for a much more

democratic approach on Angles. Each
of you shares in the songwriting credits,
and it shows. The result is a distracted
album that tries to do too much. _

“I won’t just be a puppet on a string,”
Casablancas croons on “Under Cover of
Darkness,” but he appears to be wrong.
Angles is a record made by ﬁve individ-
uals with ﬁve distinct personalities and
approaches to songwriting. Such collab-
oration may work for some bands, but
for a group known for an iconic sound
and tightly coiled production, it does not
work here.

Angles_ is inherently ﬂawed. Al-
though it does have its moments, it is by

far your weakest offering. It does show .

a desire for growth and experimentation,
but remains a sad reminder of a band
that was once great.

' “€-
Ra“ Sincerely,
Jon Salm

PatSmith explains the unnecessary necessities of a typical college male is vocabulary - complete with deﬁnitions

By Patrick Smith
c o L u M N I sr

After a conference sweep, a win over
a ranked opponent and countless bone-
less wings and tequila shots with the
baseball team, I decided to write my
ﬁrst article under the inﬂuence of alco-
hol. At least that’s what you all think...

Over February Break I had the pleas-
ant opportunity to frequent Atlanta for
.the second time in my life as a member
ofthe Generals’ baseball team. Many of

school actually read my articles. I don’t
even read my own articles, which is why
they suck. Finding out that all of these
mothers read the Phi was both exciting
and horrifying for me at the same time.
I was excited to see that I am not the
only one who laughs at my lamejokes. I
was horriﬁed to discover that a substan-
tial number of people know that I love
beer and am a closet Guido. True story;

I don ’t even read my own articles,_which is

why they suck.

my teammates’ parents, as well as mine,
were in attendance for this trip. The At-
lanta baseball trip is a great way to catch
up with the parental units and get some
free meals. I love pocketing my per
diem from the university.

While in Atlanta, I came to realize
from many of the mothers of the base-
ball team that people outside of this

my left ear is indeed pierced. ‘Twas a
game-time decision at the Jersey Shore.
Shit got real, and I was doing it live.
Knowing that such a wide demo-
graphic of individuals read what I have
to say, I thought I would put a bit more
thought into this one. In addition, know-
ing that so many mothers of W& L’s sons
read the Phi, I think it would be nice to

clue them in on some real shit.

What I would like to do is highlight
some of the key words apparent in the
average male’s vocabulary for today’s
standards. I have carefully picked ﬁve
words that men on this campus use far
too much, yet cannot refrain from using.
These words are vital to everyday com-
munication and have several different
meanings, depending on the context.

Let me start you off with a few ex-
amples:
“Dude...”
“Bro... Das Klub was so dank..”
“Damn, chill out, bro.”

If you were in any way able to de-
cipher the meanings of these phrases/
sentences: congratulations, you are not
a complete loser.

Without further ado, the ﬁve unnec-
essary necessities of a college male‘s
everyday vocabulary.

Dude:

Dude is a great word. In the afore-
mentioned phrase, “Dude. . .,” this could
mean several different things. For ex-

ample, this could be interpreted as,
“What the hell,” \“Check out this shit,”
“That chick is smokin’,” etc., etc.

Dude is an extremely flexible word.
That is perhaps the reason so many

Bro is a word that has come to frui-

Freedom by force, not an option

John Paul Beall argues that America should not intervene and decide how a foreign government should govern itself

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

A few days ago I was beset with the
question of whether or not America has
the right to impose republican govem-
ment on other countries. Does America
have the mandate to force choice upon
another nation?

The answer is a resounding no. While
in some cases intervention is justiﬁed
for various reasons, the overwhelming
majority of cases will not turn out as
planned, wasting America’s resources
and political capital, and only further
destabilizing the delicate societies in
which we intervene.

Where does this idea even origi-
nate? It is born from a national idea
called American Exceptionalism—a

kind of nationalism. This article is not
placing American Exceptionalism on
trial, as I am an Exceptionalist myself,
but complex phenomena have beneﬁts
and drawbacks. The resulting philoso-
phy is essentially a “mother knows best”

left, yet they are not the only perpetra-

herently hypocritical on multiple levels.
It is not America’s job to be the police-
man ofthe world.

Examine the following analogy. It
is not our job to choose what govern-

If your shirt does not ﬁt well and you
ask for someones help, that person can
help you go shopping for a new shirt and
help you remove it, but it is not anyone’s
job to dress people. Although ,with some
people, sometimes I wish it were.

Consider the French. They did not in-
tervene in our revolution until we asked
for help, and never did they impose upon
the thirteen colonies to construct an ab-
solute monarchy modeled on the French
government (and thank God, they did
not). Unless a country’s people ask for
assistance, it is nothing more than barg-
ing in; and often times when America
has barged in and toppled governments
it ﬁnds unsavory, it negotiated with an-
other unsavory government to be able to
get into this country in the ﬁrst place!
For every dictator we topple, we assist
another. Plus, there is something inher-

govemment and freedoms are not a one
size ﬁts all solution but cannot really be
true. The most important step in estab-
lishing a republic is investing popular
sovereignty in a country‘s people. As
long as they retain sovereignty over the
legislative process, they can literally
make the country whatever they want it
to be.

- This cuts both ways. If a country is
not ready for such a step, then the gov-
ernment will sink back into the abyss
of dictatorship, often times with more
strength than the last go-round, because
then it can possess the veneer of repub-
lican deliberation. Take Egypt, for ex-

ample. It was a puppet monarchy dur-

ing the time Great Britain occupied it.
After they relinquished control during
decolonization, the Western world as-
sisted the construction of a new Egyp-

tian govemment. After it was complete,
the military developed a powerful grip
on the country’s political system, and it
took ﬁfty years for the people to ﬁnally
rise up to cast off this organization. This
uprising was the populace deciding for
itselfthat it was ready to take its govem-
ment into its own hands~something it
was not ready to do during decoloniza-

_ tion. Americans see the bestowal ofour

political system as a gift, and indeed it
is, but it is a monumental gift that is ul-
timately the receivers’ to accept. There
are cases where people are so oppressed
and impoverished that they are unable to
revolt, and indeed it would be justiﬁed
to grant them assistance in some form.
but again, is it solely America’s burden
to help these people?

. America should not totally block it-
self out from foreign policy—that would
only be detrimental to America’s inter-
ests. Rather, America must cease mean-
ingless government toppling, because
it will almost always make conditions
in that country even worse than they
already are. Instead, let caution guide
American foreign policy. Intervention is
not always the answer.

Tennessee orchestra blings beloved musical to life

Two weeks ago, the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra performed the music from Sweeney Todd at Washington and Lee

By Holly Suthers
ARTS&L|FE EDITOR

The booming sounds of saxophones,
trombones and trumpets ﬁlled the con-
cert hall in Wilson Hall two weeks ago.
The Knoxville Jazz Orchestra performed
“Fleet Street: The Music of Sweeney
Todd” to a large audience. Led by com-
poser Terry Vosbein, the jazz orchestra
played two acts ﬁlled with memorable
music pieces from the musical.

The music of the play is emotional,
vehement and robust. The tone of each
piece captures the setting of the scene
and the mood of each character. Vos—
bein’s rendition ofthe music maintained

the same feelings and portrayed the
twisted and unusual plot ofthe play.

“Even though I hadn’t seen Sweeney
Todd, the music was both well-played
and well—written. l enjoyed the per-
formance and actually went home and
watched the musical afterward because
I wanted to know the story that went
with the music,” said senior Cameron
Dewing. V

The concert consisted of two acts
with a brief intermission between the
two. The Knoxville Jazz Orchestra had
a complete brass section, a percussion-

ist, pianist, bassist, and drummer. The
compilation of the diverse sections
united the music throughout the entire
performance.

Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber

' of Fleet Street was written by Stephen

Sondheim and performed for the ﬁrst
time in 1979. The musical is based on
the play under the same name and fol-
lows the tale of Benjamin Barker, also
known as Sweeny Todd, and his retum
to London. Todd returns l5 years af-
ter he was expelled from the city on
false charges. The plot follows the pro-

tagonist’s plan of revenge on the city’s
prominent judge whom forced him
to leave, raped his wife and kept his
daughter away from him.

“It lnade me feel like l was on Fleet
Street. It really conveyed a message.”
said junior Connor Danielowski.

Vosbein is a professor of music
at Washington and Lee and an active
composer. He and the Knoxville Jazz
Orchestra released l)l‘()gl'C.S'.\‘ll’€ Jazz in
2009. It has been praised as "a masterful
and rewarding tribute" and continlles to
receive high marks since its release. The

CD is a tribute to formerjazz bandleader
Stan Kenton, a model and inspiration for
Vosbein.

W&L will host several upcoming
concerts in the future. For a schedule

The Washington and Lee men’s ten-

win Friday aftemoon against Hampden-

Following an easy 9-0 away victory
over Randolph College on Tuesday af-

8-0 record in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

The match was a clash between the

Best basketball blockbusters

In honor of March Madness, an AP writer lists her favorite basketball movies...but where s “Love and Basketball”?

By Christy Lemire
AP MOVIE crmrc
LOS ANGELES (AP) — There are

a lot of basketball movies in the world, _

and most of them are pretty terrible.
They’re corny or too feel-good, they
feature awkward celebrity cameos or
they try to wedge in an uncomfortable
romance. But some of them get the sport
— and the people who play it — just
right.

With March Madness upon us, these
are ﬁve of my favorite basketball mov-
ies. Your bracket will probably look dif-
ferent. You will notice the omission of
“Hoosiers,” which is not an oversight.
Yes, it’s the standard for basketball
ﬁlms, but it’s too obvious, and has long
since felt like a manipulative underdog
cliche. Gene Hackman is always great,
but sorry, the slow clap doesn’t play
here; I cringe just thinking about it.

them exactly as they are, lets us get to

hard to be either, and it’s far more en-

scripted melodrama. Not just one of the

A “The Basketball Diaries” (1995):
Leonardo DiCaprio is electrifying as
Jim Carroll, the late New York poet
and musician who chronicled his teen-
age descent into heroin addiction in his
memoir of the same name. Growing up
in Manhattan, Carroll played basketball
for his elite Catholic high school and
dreamed of athletic stardom. Instead,
he would follow a dangerous path of
sex and drugs, artistic inspiration and
self-destruction. (The ﬁlm moves the
time period from the 1960s to the pres-
ent.) This early DiCaprio performance,
along with his Oscar-nominated work in
“What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,” offer an
exciting glimpse at the fearless actor he
would become.

height of his “Family Ties” and “Back
to the Future” fame, Fox came out with
this comedy about a scrawny player on
a struggling high school basketball team
who discovers he’s a werewolf. It’s as
high-concept as you can get. Turning
into a werewolf turns him into a mon-
ster both on and off the court — and yes,
“Teen Wolf” turns into a very tradition-
ally ‘80s-style cautionary tale about the
perils of instant popularity. But there’s
something nostalgically comforting
about that, and Fox, with his endear-
ing sense of self-deprecation and natu-
ral comic timing, somehow makes it all
work better than it should.

After three straight wins, baseball is 9-8 on the season led

By Stephen Peck
5 TA F F W R IT E R
.,,,F,.  _ a  ,, 

Just ﬁve days ago, the Washington and
Lee baseball team found themselves at 6-8
after dropping both games of a doubleheader
to Southern Virginia University by scores of
l I-9 and 7-4. ‘

They now stand at 9-8 and above .500 for
the ﬁrst time since March 1, after rattling off
three straight wins thanks to three dazzling

' pitching performances: 8-3 and 5-0 wins over

Guilford and another 5-0 win versus Tufts.

The Generals welcomed the Knights of
SVU to Cap’n Dick Smyth Field on Wednes-
day and hoped to keep the momentum rolling
from their demolition of Roanoke the prior
Saturday. SVU had other ideas.

SVU, enjoying one of their best starts in
school history at l0-2,jumped on W&L early
in game one, tagging freshman pitcher Jake
Rudolph for two quick runs in the ﬁrst. W&L
would answer in the bottom of the frame with
three runs of its own, and the slugfest was on.

SVU’s Andrew Snider went deep in the
third to tie the game at three, and the Knights
wouldn’t stop there. They added two in the
fourth and three in the ﬁfth and extended their
lead to 8-3. The Generals clawed their way
back, thanks to a two-run bomb by sopho-
more ﬁrst baseman Alex Maragos and forced
extra innings when sophomore outﬁelder Joe
Scalzo tied the game at eight with a bases
clearing, three-run double. The late inning
heroics eventually ran out for the Generals, as

‘ they fell by a ﬁnal score of 1 1-9.

Snider had a career day for the Knights,
going 5-6 with two RBIs and four runs scored
as SVU continued the Generals out-of-con-
ference woes.

, Sophomore shortstop Jonathan Stutts says
there is a method behind the apparent non-
ODAC struggles.

“The true measure of the team should be
seen in our conference record,” he said. “We
don’t play enough games to earn an at-large
bid to the NCAAS, so we need to win the
ODAC and those are the games we get more
hyped up for.”

in game two, SVU had similar success,
this time against W&L’s ace, junior pitcher
Roger Strong. Strong was knocked out of the

/\
t 5

l 

  

game after giving up ﬁve runs in only l.l in-
nings of work, although no runs were earned.

' Freshman pitcher Britt Dalton picked up
the win for SVU, allowing only two runs and
ﬁve hits over six innings.

Stutts led all W&L hitters on the day,
going 4-9 with three doubles, a triple, three
RBIs, and four runs. Maragos ﬁnished both
games with three hits in six at bats with four
RBls.

To ﬁnd a measure of consistency, Strong
said they “need to ﬁnd our rhythm pitching
and ﬁelding." They did just that over the
weekend.

—After dropping ﬁve of their last seven
games, the Gennies were determined to right
the ship when they traveled to Guilford for
an ODAC doubleheader on Saturday. A bit of
redemption from Strong in game one wasjust
the spark W&L would need to go on a win-
ning streak of their own.

Strong scattered nine hits and only two
runs while striking out four in his 6.1 innings
of work. Despite his efforts, W&L still found
themselves down 2-] going into the bottom
of the eighth. Stutts’s double to lead off the
inning sent Guilford starter Zach Daw, who
was having a brilliant outing of his own, to
the showers and the Quakers turned to the
bullpen. It would be the worst mistake they
made all day.

The Generals batted around the order and
exploded for seven runs in the inning before
Maragos showed some mercy and popped out
to end the onslaught. A sacriﬁce fly was all
the offense Guilford could muster in the top
ofthe ninth, bringing the ﬁnal score to 8-3.

Strong seemed conﬁdent that this was
a big step to regaining his dominant 2010
form. “Until Saturday I was deﬁnitely pitch-
ing much less than my best,” he said. “Coach
Smith has been working with me the last
week to get my, mechanics back in order,
which likely was the reason why I pitched
better this last game.”

Senior pitcher Gregg Laswell outdid the
efforts of Strong in game two, as he twirled
a complete game shutout en route to a 5-0
W&L win. His masterful performance in-

  

by strong pitching

    

cluded seven strikeouts amid four hits, all of
which were singles.

“He simply overpowered every hitter four
times,” Stutts said of Laswell’s dominance.
“He used the same approach against every
individual guy.”

A double by Maragos in the top of the
ﬁrst that drove in senior outﬁelder Anthony
Cardona was all the scoring Laswell would

need. They would eventually bang out 15 hits"

in total though, with sophomore third base-
man Mike Savas going 3-4 with an RBI to
lead the way. ‘I

The way the season has gone for the
Generals, one wouldn”t be wrong to expect
the worst when W&L faced Tufts at home
on Sunday afternoon. W&L’s shoddy out of
conference record, coupled with Tufts being
ranked 17th in the nation and the fact that
W&L had yet to win three games in a row
this year, added up to impending disaster.
Jody Davis was having none ofthat.

— The junior right-hander got the start for
the Generals and did his best Gregg Laswell
impersonation. He went the distance, shutting
out the Jumbos and striking out ﬁve in lead-
ing the Generals to the 5-0 upset win.

“He threw out of his mind,” Stutts said of
Davis.

Much like the game before, a run by Car-
dona in the ﬁrst off of a Stutts sacriﬁce ﬁy
would be all the offense Davis needed to
work with. Cardona ﬁnished 3-5 with two
runs scored.

‘After an up and down season, the Generals

are now enjoying a modest winning streak. .

“We are starting to get conﬁdent,” Stutts said.
“Our chemistry is really starting to come to-
gether. We can’t get complacent.”

The Generals will need a similar perfor-
mance on Tuesday as they host the number‘
one team in the nation in the Shenandoah
University Hornets. First pitch is scheduled
for 3:30 p.m.

Team members encourage and con-
gratulate each other they head off
the field during Saturday’s game.
