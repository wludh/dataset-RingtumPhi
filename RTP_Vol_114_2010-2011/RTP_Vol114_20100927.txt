Dining .
Services goes
green

New take-out boxes part
of an eﬂortto increase
sustainability

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

During orientation week, 25 freshmen and 25 up-
perclassmen received free eco-takeout containers to
use in the marketplace. The system works by allow-
ing students to trade in a wooden token for a takeout
box, ‘which they use and then return back to the mar-
ketplace to get their token back.

Participants in the pilot program will soon give
official feedback on how well the program works.
The one-month test is set to end Oct. 10.

The new containers are both larger and sturdier
then the current paper and oil-based to-go boxes.
This means no more soggy, overstuffed cardboard.
But the real benefit is in their sustainability.

They are made from renewable plastic and, at
other schools with this system, like the University of
Florida, they have lasted for several years. U Florida
reports that they only had to replace approximately
10 percent of their containers per year.

While all marketplace cups, plates, and plas-
tic ware have been biodegradable for the past two
years, Dining Services feels that in light of the Rock-
bridge County landﬁll closing in 2012, even this is
not enough.

“Dining Services is trying to do everything it
can for sustainability,” said Chris Carpenter, spe-

“Dining services is trying
to do everything it can for
sustainability... the program
works. ”

Chris carpenter, Dining Services

cial projects coordinator with Dining Services. Past

. projects include environmentally safe dishwashing,

going tray-less in the dining hall and buying more
locally produced food.

At this point, it seems that this new program will
be added permanently to the list of W&L’s green
initiatives because there has been “no feedback that
would make us pause,” said Carpenter. “The pro-
gram works.” He has already received e-mails from
students praising the eco-takeout boxes.

‘ Research for this program started three years ago,
after U Florida implemented the system with great

success. The program worked so well that W&L had _

to get in line while the industry caught up to demand
from colleges across the country. -

The program is scheduled to go public on Oct.
15, assuming positive reviews from the pilot group.
At this time, students must pay approximately $3 of
cash, food debit or general debit for the to-go boxes,
but this will be a “one-time purchase,” said Carpen-
ter, “Just don’t lose your token.”

Marketplace Director Dennis Fowler estimates
that dining services will have to order between 300

and 400 containers just to get started. These contain- 5

ers will be available for drop-off and pick-up at the
Marketplace, Cafe’ 77 and the sorority houses.

The
(SEAL) and the W&L Food Council have also been
involved with the pilot program, according to a
W&L news release. ‘

Carpenter said that W&L’s push for sustainability
goes right along with its motto, “Not Unmindful of
the Future.” .

“We have a great responsibility,” he said of Din-
ing Services, which is “still part of the education
structure.” For Carpenter, the green initiative simply
reinforces what is taught in any environmental sci-'
ence or bioethics classroom.

To taste Dining Services’ commitment to sustain-
ability by buying local food, stop by the Fall Har-
vest Dinner this Wednesday. Going green has never
tasted so good.

The new Washington and Lee
Hillel House was dedicated Saturday
Sept. 25 at the end of a celebratory
weekend full of events.

Thursday night Hillel hosted a
speech by’ Ruth Messinger, presi-
dent of the American Jewish World
Service. She spoke ofJews as global

staff, parents and alumni. Vice Presi-
dent of Hillel Rimona Carton said,
“The entire W&L community com-
ing together for this special weekend
made me truly appreciate everything
W&L has done to help bring this
wonderful Hillel House to our cam-
pus.” The service was followed by a

Ruscio, who spoke on the complete
involvement of the W&L commu-
nity in bringing a‘ Hillel house to
campus. '

According to Ruscio, “our build-
ings [at W&L] reflect our values.”-
He told of the generous ‘donations of
the members of the Board of Trust-

Mark Grunewald. The new women’s
choir under the direction of Shane
Lynch sang “Shalom Chaverim”
in celebration of the event. After
the ceremony, the E. Café offered
samples of bagels and was open for
lunch. Tours were also provided.
The Hillel House serves as both
a home for the Jewish community
of W&L and Lexington, and as a
space accessible to the entire W&L

' community. The inulti-purpose room

can host lectures and classes as well
as Hillel services. For the ﬁrst time,

 Lexington is home to a Torah, the
 , scrolls containing the sacred Jewish

texts, which is housed in this room.
The E. Cafe, a student lounge and a

kosher community kitchen make up

the rest of the downstairs. Offices and
a conference room used to host both
seminars and meetings complete the

 ‘second story ofthe building.

Remembering Granvi

A tribute to an amazing young man whose legacy, intelligence ana’ personality will not be forgotten

By Diandra Spicak and Eleanor Kennedy

MANAGING AND NEWS EDITORS

“Granvil was the type of per-
son who made others happy,”
said senior Susan Taylor.

With eyes that lit up behind
wire—rimmed glasses, Granvil
George, a member of the class
of 2011, brought joy to all those
who knew him. Diagnosed with
germ cancer in December while
studying abroad at Oxford, Gran-
vil seemed more concerned with
how his illness would affect ev-
eryone else. He would engage in
normal activities with his friends
and family, crushing them in
games like Scrabble.

A quick perusal of the com-
ments left on Granvil’s F acebook
wall show just how much of an
impact he had on those around
him, from brightening a friend’s
day in class or inspiring another
to live up to higher academic
standards. Granvil did not dis-
criminate but forged friendships
with everyone. Quiet and hum-
ble, the thin boy from Charleston
had a way with people.

“My life is layered with
his positive impact,” said Jes-
sica Jones, another classmate of
Granvil’s. “No one so amiable
and laid-back could provide the
ﬁnest guidance for the nitty-
gritty situations in life. No one
so young could know so much.
No one so skinny could eat that

much. No one who is so addicted
and devoted to Arrested Devel-
opment, Frisbee and Boggle
could be so academically unpar-
alleled.”

Granvil’s dedication to aca-
demics began at an early age.
Interested in everything he stud-
ied, he latched on to varying sub-
jects ranging from chemistry and
Spanish, theology and philoso-
phy. He always seemed to have
his nose in a book.

His passion for learning did
not wane when he started at
Washington and Lee. A double
major in philosophy and neu-
roscience, Granvil was a Lewis
Scholarship recipient, a Uni-
versity Scholar and a member
of both Phi Eta Sigma and Phi
Beta Kappa honorary societ-
ies. He consistently made the
Dean’s List and the honor roll.
He made a perfect score on the
Graduate Record Exam (GRE)
and planned to attend graduate
school for philosophy.

According to senior Sam
Gilleran, Granvil was “simply
brilliant.”

“He was always overloading
to take 17, I8, 19 credits because
he had an unquenchable thirst for
knowledge and he had the ability
to process it all,” Gilleran said.

But Granvil was more than

Granvil George was one of the most-loved students at
W&L. According to senior Susan Taylor, “Granvil was the

just an excellent student. For phi-
losophy professor James Mahon,
Granvil was a valued friend who
always made life a little more fun.
When Mahon e-mailed Granvil
to tell him he’d been accepted
to study at Oxford, Granvil ﬁrst
responded, “I joyfully accept the
position and am very grateful for
the selection.”

Moments later, Mahon found
another e-mail in his inbox. With
the subject line, “on a less for-
mal note,” Granvil had written,
“Hooray!”

Mahon says he will always
remember Granvil as that same
joyous young man who was “al-
ways laughing, always smiling.
And tall.”

Even those who did not know
Granvil particularly well recog-
nized that he was an impressive
young man. Junior Clarke Mor-
rison knew Granvil only from a
few interactions during the short
time they were -on this campus
together. Still, Morrison said he
recognized Granvil as “a meek
man” with a “quiet strength.”

This strength came from
Granvil’s steadfast faith, a qual-
ity which deﬁned him. He be-
longed to both the Generals
Christian Fellowship and the Re-
formed University Fellowship.
Senior Beth Valentine took sev-
eral classes with Granvil, was his
teammate in the Ethics Bowl and
attended the same church he did
for a time. She said that Granvil’s
faith “was very obvious in all of
his interactions.”

Perhaps it was this faith that
made Granvil so optimistic, even
when discussing the difficult sub-
ject of his cancer. Valentine said
she felt like Granvil spent more
of his time comforting those who
were worried about him than
looking for their comfort.

When Granvil e-mailed his
friends to tell them of his illness,
Taylor said he focused on the
science of it, since many of his
peers were in the sciences. Even
in the face of such unpleasant

I George  

news, Granvil was eager to re-
main positive and share his thirst
for knowledge with others.

This passion for sharing
knowledge, for teaching and
learning from his peers, is one
of the qualities Mahon appreci-
ated most about Granvil. Mahon

I took great pleasure in the books

that Granvil recommended him,
something few other students
have ever done.

While Granvil was abroad,
Mahon sent him an e-mail de-
scribing the novels of Stieg Lars-
son as “the latest intellectual
must—read.”

Granvil responded, with
characteristic intelligence and
wit, “Ahh, the latest intellectual
must—read, that makes sense.
Those tend to be fun; I at least
always enjoy being able to dis-
cuss Umberto Eco. I actually saw
a big advertisement in the Prague
metro today for one of his books,
which made a nice change from
the far more ubiquitous Twilight
advertisements.”

That’s how Mahon says he
likes to think of one of his bright-
est and best students: “Standing
on a metro platform in Prague,
about to explore the world.”

Saying good bye to a good friend

A group of Washington and Lee students heads to-Alum Springs, W. Va. for Granvil George is funeral

By Sam Gilleran

COPY EDITOR, SUBMITTED VIA TEXT MESSAGE

The Forks of Coal Baptist
Church in Alum Springs, W. Va.,
was ﬁlled beyond capacity Sun-
day night as mourners assembled
to remember Granvil George.

Four eulogizers, including
W&L Prof. James Mahon, re-
membered Granvil as a gregari-
ous and brilliant student. The
service began promptly at 5 p.m.
with pealing bells.

There were several selections
sung by the church choir, as well
as instrumental interludes in be-

tween speakers. The comforting
words of the eulogies, which
quoted Psalm 23 and other tra-
ditional Scriptures, failed to halt
the tears throughout the country
church; the numerous anecdotes
recollecting Granvil’s sense of
humor provided welcome laugh-
ter to lighten the somber mood in
the hall.

After the service, the church
provided a dinner of fried chick-
en, mashed potatoes and other
vegetables.

About 40 students made the
trek from Lexington to Alum
Springs to memorialize Granvil.

The Office of Student Affairs
rented a charter bus, which left
the parking deck at noon, to ac-

“It was nice to see the place
where Granvil came from, his
family and friends,” said senior

across the hall from Granvil his
freshman year.

Crystal Spencer, a senior who
was on RA staff with Granvil, re-
ferred to it as the happiest funeral
she had ever attended, while an-
other attendee said, “It really ex-

The women of W&L: then and now

First president of Panhel speaks to W&L about the ways things have changea’, for better or worse, since her time here

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The classrooms of Washing-
ton and Lee are quieter than they
used to be, according to W&L
alumnus and ﬁrst-ever Panhel-
lenic Council president Jane Lee
Forster. ’

Last Thursday, Forster gav
a speech about how much W&L
has changed since it ﬁrst became
a co-ed institution, 25 years ago.
Forster was a member of the
class of 1990, the second co-ed
class at the university.

Forster said that there seems
to be a pressure on present-day
W&L women to be somewhat
unobtrusive and inconspicuous
in the classroom. This contrasts
with the account provided of the
ﬁrst classes of W&L women,
whom she described as being
“audacious.”

These women, according to
Forster, were willing to take big
risks. ‘‘I think we had to be,” she
said.

These risk-taking women
were members of a W&L com-
munity that is very different

from the one that exists today. ‘
‘ and the creation of a Panhellenic

Lexington was even smaller 25
years ago than it is now, and
there were not very many oppor-
tunities for women on campus to
interact with one another social-
ly. Women could not meet up on
the weekends to go to Pumpkin-
seeds or Alvin Dennis, which did
not have a women’s department
back then; there was no sushi
restaurant where these women

could chat and dine on spicy tuna
rolls. Even the number of ladies’
restrooms on campus was insuf-
ﬁcient—another crucial blow to
the social life of the W&L wom-
en. Predominantly male fratemi-
ty parties comprised pretty much
the entire social scene. '

“We decided to take control of
our own destiny,” Forster said.

In order to do this, Forster and
other women of her class with
strong leadership skills founded
a women’s forum called Trident.
This forum was a social outlet for
women, providing opportunities
for interaction and discussion.

One example of this collabo-
ration was the social event that
Trident coordinated called Con-
fetti. Confetti was the ﬁrst social
function at W&L where one had
to be invited by a woman in or-
der to attend, and it was a major
success.

The innovation of the W&L
women paid oﬂ‘ with Confetti,

and it was then on to a much larg— ‘

er endeavor: the colonization of
the ﬁrst three sororities at W&L

Council to oversee them.

“I didn’t do anything magical,
but I did stand up,” Forster said
when she discussed her role as
the ﬁrst president of Panhel. This
idea drove much of her speech;
the idea that all a woman on this
campus has to do in order to be a
leader is to speak up and express

_ her ideas to others.

Forster said that sororities
became a “perfect vehicle” for
leadership and service opportu-
nities, as they still are today.

Forster touched on some of

the aspects of the W&L commu-
nity of the present day that may
be cause, not for concern, but
for action on the part of W&L
women.

“I think that gender relations
have regressed a little bit,” For-
ster said, after she discussed the

seem to behave in the classroom
these days.

started something and now it is
time for this generation of W&L
women to pick up where they
left off, she said.

Forster described the current
composition of the Executive
Committee and the Student Judi-
cial Council as an enigma. While

women now make up about 50
percent of the student body, they
do not occupy anywhere near 50
percent of the seats in the gov-

While Forster conceded that
she may not have done anything
magical, she was a part of a cata-
lyst for a huge and lasting change
on this campus: the inclusion of
women in the Greek system.

the motto of our school, a motto
that the women working to cre-

Part I : Some Democrats excited about report that

Controversy has erupted over
the consensus of the National
Bureau of Economic Research’s
Business Cycle Dating Commit-
tee.

On Sept. 17, they declared
that the recession started in Dec.
2007, has been over since June
2009, lasting a total of eighteen
months. Also dubbed the worst
recssion since the Great Depres-
sion, this recession is now of-
ﬁcially four months longer than
any of the other recessions in the
Post-Depression Era.

This means that, according
to the National Bureau of Eco-
nomic Research, the recession
has been over fora year and three.

employment rates went up past

endorsed by these individuals.

This behavior comes at a time
when they certainly have incen-
tive to boast about economic
“improvements”: on the eve of a
midterm election where the GOP
is projected to swing back hard,
perhaps even to retake Con-
gress. .
Most politicians know that,
among voters, the economy acts
as the primary voting criterion
at the polls. And nowadays, the
Democrats do not have the nec-

months. However, the ﬁfteen
months since the recession sup-
posedly ended have been charac-
terized by abysmal ﬁow of credit
and a recovery of 749,779 jobs
out of over 7 million lost (ac-
cording to recovery. gov). The
national unemployment average
is hovering around 9.6 percent as
of last month. However, certain
states are still have unemploy-
ment rates as high as 14 percent

tics).

There has not been a marked
improvement as of yet; rather,
the economy just seemsto have
bottomed out for a while.

Most of the current economic
data is relatively unchanged
from one year ago, right after the
recession supposedly ended.

Did I forget to mention that in

three days following the report
was one of the ﬁrst truly marked
upswings since the recession ap-
parently ended, but this upswing
is unsurprising considering the
effect of expectations on mar-
kets.,

Granted, the agreed deﬁni-
tion of a recession is a period of
economic contraction; however,
the end of this contraction is not
necessarily the beginning of new
expansion. Furthermore, expan-
sion seems increasingly doubtful
considering the many worries
that developed nations will have
a slow recovery, maybe even a
second recession.

"   Parties gearing up for 2010 elections

Part2: (GOP announces new “Pledge to America ”

Last Friday marked the dawn-
ing of a new political chapter in
the annals of the Republican Par-
ty as leading conservative mem-
bers of Congress met in a lum-
beryard of a Virginia suburb of
Washington to announce the new
“Pledge to America,” the new and

rity, summarized in the following
paragraphs.

Important points under the
section of economics include a
commitment to “permanently
stop any and all job-killing tax
hikes,” subsidize small business
growth by reducing business in-

way, Americans can be insured
more easily and at lower cost.

mind), a mandate that legislation

improved platform for the Grand
Old Party.

It is currently a fascinating
time to be involved or interest-
ed in politics, especially if you
are a conservative. The last two
years have been tumultuous and
demoralizing, with some of our
own hailing it as “the end of the
GOP.”

Of course, it has not helped
that there are no faces that Repub-
licans could hold as their standard
bearers except Glenn Beck, Rush
Limbaugh and Sarah Palin.

All we could do these past two
years was watch powerlessly as
the health care bill was ram-rod-
ded through the hallowed halls of
Congress. It was as if we were lost
in the woods with no breadcrumbs
to lead us out. But no more.

The former GOP juggernaut
has continued to pick up steam
lately, especially as projections
foreshadow a possible change of
power in Congress. Nowadays,
the once-dismayed and embar-
rassed constituents of the GOP
are re-energized for the coming
elections in November.

The legislative agenda an-
nounced for the Republican Party
was divided into ﬁve sections:

the economy, government ex-.

penditure, health care, govem-
ment reforms and national secu-

come taxes by 20 percent, stream-
lining government “red tape” and
undoing certain cumbersome and
“job-killing business mandates.”

One of these business man-
dates the GOP has pledged to
kill is a clause of the health care
bill that requires all businesses
to make a report to the IRS for
any income or expenditure in
excess of $600 (seriously, that’s
in there!). These are expected to
foster economic growth in these
difficult times. .

The major concern for gov-
ernment spending is a balanced
budget, to be created by capping
discretionary funds at a certain
level, a'cut in general spending
to pre-bailout levels, a request for
weekly votes on spending cuts, an
end to “TARP for once and for all”
and a hiring freeze for all federal
bureaucracy positions not dealing
immediately with security. All of
these measures should slim down
the government through natural
attrition.

For health care, essential points
made are the permanence of the
Hyde Amendment, ensuring no
federal money is applied to abor-
tion (which has to be reviewed
annually) and a motion to replace

- the health care bill with one spe-

ciﬁcally geared to legislate medi-
cal liability or tort reform. This

Democrats not quite sold on “Pledge to America”

Democrats do not believe that the new GOP plan will ensure a Republican November victory

By Summer Lollie
COLU M NIST

Last week, Republican lead-
ers revealed their “Pledge to
America,” a 21-page document
that outlines policy principles
that House Republicans pledge
, to follow.

The pledge was designed to
echo Newt Gingrich’s “Contract
with America,” which is widely
associated with the 12-year Re-
publican congressional majority
(shudder) that the country ex-
perienced before the 2006 elec-
tions.

Eerily similar, if not just a
photocopied version of Newt’s
“Contract,” the “Pledge” touches
' on many hot-button GOP issues:
make the Bush tax cuts perma-
nent for the top 2 percent, repeal

health care, institute hiring
freezes and cut spending—but
pledge to ﬁilly fund missile de-
fense programs.

Speaking about the pre-
amble to the GOP “Pledge,”
House Republican Leader John
Boehner admitted to America
that the GOP plan is much of
the same: “‘We are not going I
to be any different than we’ve
been.”

It seems as if, in the four
years that the Republicans have
lost control of Congress, their
soul-searching (remember the
website Americaspeakingout.
com?) to come up with fresh new
ideas returned fruitless.

Or maybe it was a conscious

us 8 million American jobs, dou-

our economy.”

The CIA’s professed core values of “Service, Integrity and Ex-
cellence” would be laughable if the Agency were not such a threat
to our national reputation and a peaceful world. Its long and proven
record of murder and covert action in support of dictatorships and
against democratically elected governments, perceived by the right
as too liberal, demonstrates the agency’s real values: Capitalism,‘
US Domination and Underhandedness.

ratively and literally). And I re-
spect them for that. I really do.
With more ﬁlibusters than
~in the history of Congress, Re-
publicans have obstructed and
destroyed important pieces of
legislation such as the repeal of
“Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” cam-
paign ﬁnance reform, unemploy-
ment beneﬁts and tax credits for

small business. They did this ‘

while weakening the Wall Street
reform bill, among a laundry list
of others.

It is predicted that the Demo-
crats will face a bloodbath come
November. This is a prediction
that makes me lose sleep at
night.

However, after reading the
Republican “Pledge to Ameri-
ca”, I was reminded of why I am
and always will be a Democrat.

As imperfect and disorga-
nized as Democrats may be, I
belong to a party that is open to
fresh ideas. I belong to a party
that wants to move forward to
something greater.

I’ve been called naive, too
hopeful or just plain stupid. But

writers include a clause demon-
strating the constitutionality of
the bill if passed and an effort to
prevent non-topical bills from be-
ing joined. ’

It further goes on in the na-
tional security to keep troop fund-
ing bills “clean,” in order to cut
down on pork barrel funding, that
Iran be sanctioned unless it abides
by the nuclear security constraints
that the UN negotiated earlier this
year and that all persons suspect
of terrorism be kept off of United
States soil.

The l 994 Contract With Amer-
ica was highly successful. Repub-
licans took 54 seats in the House,
gaining the ﬁrst GOP majority in
the House since Eisenhower was
president.

Of course, Speaker Pelosi has
already issued a most fervent
statement via e-mail against the
platform.

One thing is certain, though:

this upcoming election will be

one for the history books.

it is not I who will return the
keys to the party that drove us
into the ditch that we are in. It is
not I who will hand the mop over
to the ones who made the mess
in the ﬁrst place.

This is my pledge to Ameri-
ca: I will not let my myopia and
anger cloud my judgment about
which party is on the right side
of history.

Politics around the country: Bell tolls for CA city officials

Alarmingly high payments for city oﬁicials outside Los Angeles show massive corruption among civil service unions

By John Paul Beall
COLUM NIST

The arrests of eight civil ser-
vants brought justice to Bell, Ca-
lif. on Sept. 20. j

This working class, inner-city
town, within view from the Los
Angeles City Hall, had woken up
in July to ﬁnd that its top eight
top‘ city employees were taking
the highest salaries, beneﬁts and
pension plans in the state and the
nation.

City Manager Robeit Rizzo
accepted an exorbitant $787,637
annual salary and another
$712,000 in beneﬁts, collecting a
total of$ 1.5 million last year. His
salary was contracted to increase
every year by 12 percent, and
also to receive 156 vacation days '

per year as part of his contract.

Consider that congress-
men make $l74,000 annually,
the President makes $400,000
and most other California up-
per city employees make about
$200,000.

Other members of the City
Council and lower city employ-
ees were earning more than
$100,000 per year until taking a ‘
pay cut when the salaries came to
light. There were several instanc-
es when the city nearly erupted
in riots.

The enormous salaries of
Rizzo and seven other city em-
ployees were supported by three
known cases of illegal taxation

of citizens and businesses within
the city, found by state auditors
this past month, culminating in
the Attorney General’s ofﬁce
ﬁling a criminal lawsuit against
these eight employees arrested
on the 20th.

Those arrested include Rizzo,
former Assistant City Manager
Angela Spaccia; Councilmem-
bers Luis Artiga, Teresa Jacobo
and George Mirabal; Mayor Os-
car Hernandez; and former Coun-
cilmembers George Cole and
Victor Bello. Police had to use a
battering ram to break down the
mayor’s door.

The State Controller’s office
estimates that the citizens of Bell

and more than 1,000 area busi-
nesses were illegally taxed over
a sum of $5.6 million, charged
large sewer maintenance fees, a
“retirement tax” ($2.9 million,
to support pension plans) that
lacked sufﬁcient voter approval,
and an over-large property tax
rate, 1.55 percent of the assessed
value of their house, 34 percent
above the average. L.A. County
average is 1.16 percent, and Bev-
erly Hills, a city with four times
the per capita income of Bell,
pays 1.19 percent for its property
taxes.

Bell has the second highest
taxation rate in L.A. County. One
of the poorest towns in Calif, it

is also one of the worst hit areas
by the recession.

State Controller John Chiang
concludes that the tax levels were
too high to be legal, though Rob-
ert Rizzo shamelessly responded
to outrage over his $1.5 million
king’s ransom of a paycheck in
saying that, “If that’s a number 1
people choke on, maybe I’m in
the wrong business... I could go
into private business and make
that kind of money. This council
has compensated me for the job
I’ve done.” What a disconnect
certain parts of our government
have with respect to the private
sector!

In light of this, perhaps it is

time for Californians to consider
some serious civil service re-
form. I

Reform is needed especially
with respect to the civil service
unions, who wield a huge amount
of power within the state.

Still, all Americans, whether
or not their public employees are
cheating them, should consider
what happens when we are not
paying attention to our govem-
ment, and what a ,dear price we
pay for our ignorance.

Twitter is not the narcissistic waste of time you believe it is

Forget the stereotype; it 3 time that to grow up and start implementing Twitter into your daily session of Internet surﬁng

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

We spent decades in America
trying to minimize racial and
gender stereotypes around the
country. Nowadays, an i1l—ad-
vised joke or offhanded remark
can cause someone to lose a
friend or even ajob.

However, there are still ste-
reotypes that are used unabash-
edly all the time. People make
references without really know-
ing what they are talking about
or how people will take their hor-
ribly offensive comments. Yes,
Internet stereotypes are no joke.

I am tired of constantly hear-
ing people bash these harmless
websites simply because these
people want to believe the ig-
norant lies that are spread about
them. Craigslist is for serial kill-
ers. MySpace is for pedophiles
and people who genuinely enjoy
wearing black nail polish on a

daily basis. Men only use Google
Images for. . .uh. . .paintings from
the late Northem Renaissance.
We’ve heard all these miscon-
ceptions before, and while all of
them have some basis in fact, the
point and the way that these web-
sites are actually used completely
differs from the stereotype.
Today, Craigslist is used to
ﬁnd legitimate jobs and servic-
es, some of which actually pay
good money. Bands have used
MySpace for years, and there are
a good amount of musicians to-
day that would not be where they
are if it were not for MySpace.
As for Google Images, well, let’s
not cover that one right now.
This brings me to my most
hated Internet stereotype: Twit-
ter. According to conventional
wisdom, Twitter is used by nar-
cissists and aspiring Perez Hil-

ton’s. ~
Although both of those types

of people do play a role in the '

Twitter universe, they end up
playing the same role as pedo-
philes on MySpace and serial
killers on Craigslist. Twitter is
not about those people. Maybe
that is what made Twitter a fad,
but what keeps Twitter still going
is what it is really used for.

Simply put, Twitter is an in-
stantaneous, customizable news-
feed. That’s it. It provides that
simple service for you, and all
the other garbage used on the
website is irrelevant.

Now, before you remember
that this is Twitter I’m talking
about, think about this. Wouldn’t
you like to be able to go to a
website either on your phone or
on the web and having a running
news feed of information that
you care about?

Is that really going to end up
being a drain on your life to the
point where you are embarrassed
to mention your association with
it?

I have had a Twitter account
since March 2009. Even now, it
feels like I’m tellingyou that l’ve
been interested in bestiality since
March 2009. I joined for two

reasons: I like sports, and I like
knowing more than other people.
Twitter has helped me out with
my two likes perfectly.

Before any news hits the In-
ternet or even television, it goes
to Twitter. Before analysis hits
the newsstands or even the rest
of the Internet, it goes to Twitter.
‘Therefore, when something you
care about happens in the world,
Twitter lets you be one of the
ﬁrst people to ﬁnd out. Plus, you
can be the ﬁrst one to know what
other people think about what
just happened.

Knowing other people’s
analysis can get you pretty far in
life. The majority of insightful
and funny things I say are solely
thanks to Twitter. l’ve tried be-
ing original, but in the end, those
jokes fall ﬂat and that insight
usually gets laughed at.

Only on Twitter can I have
Kenny Powers tell me “If you
think the Little Dick World Se-
ries means anything then you’re
probably a big fan of horoscopes,
too.” That little joke earned me
a chuckle or two at a lunch dur-
ing O-Week. Without Twitter, it
wouldn’t have been possible.

Besides jokes and meaning-
less sports stories, Twitter actual-

ly serves a role in news that mat-
ters. After Hurricane Gustav and
Ike hit the Gulf Coast in 2008,
gas prices in the Gulf soared,
and many gas stations in Atlanta
didn’t have any gas to sell. Gas
starved Atlanta natives turned to
the upstart Twitter to solve their
problem.

Whenever an Atlanta resident
would ﬁnd a working gas station
they would Tweet the location
and follow it with “#atlgas.” This
trending topic would let anyone
search Twitter for all mentions
of “#atlgas.” This story was
covered relentless by the media
when it ﬁrst happened, but situa-
tions like this happen all the time
on Twitter.

So, the ﬁnal question you
are probably asking yourself is,
“What would I Tweet about?”
Well, nothing actually.

That’s the best part about
Twitter. You don’t need to Tweet
to use it. Most people who use
Twitter are probably not that in-
teresting. I am one of them. So,
why would I need inﬂate my al-
ready monstrous ego and tell the
Internet something that nobody
will care about?

I really don’t need to, and
when you join Twitter (you’ll

get there eventually), you won’t
need to either. '

That’s really the point. In Au-
gust 2009, a research company
ﬁrm named Pear Analytics con-
cluded that only 4% of Tweets
on Twitter were news related.
Due to that low percentage, in
Nov. 2009, Twitter made a point
of focusing on making news a
priority. That prioritizing is now
starting to come to fruition and
almost every conceivable news
source now posts links and up-
dates on Twitter.

So now that you know how to
properly use Twitter? What’s the
problem with it?

The Ashton Kutcher’s and
Kim Kardashian’s of the world
still play a major role on the web-
site, but they are getting a less
and less share of the trafﬁc.

This medium for providing 1

quick updates, good links and
breaking headlines is currently
the hottest thing in media right
now.

Just try and explain to me why
this website is still deserving of
its negative stereotype. Well, ex-
plain in less than 140 characters.
You’re going to‘be abiding by
that limit more often.

Dating 10:]; a boy’s guide to first dates

Tired of watching them constantly screw up easy chances, Campbell Burr gives
guys some much-needed advice

By Campbell Burr
C0 LU MNIST

The home phone rang, wak-
ing me from my Saturday mom-
ing slumber. I leaned over and
looked at my clock, 10:01. Too
early. After lingering in bed for
another 30 minutes, I» headed
downstairs for some breakfast.

“Campbell!” my mom greet-
ed me as I entered the kitchen,
“Some boy, John Wilson, called
the home phone this morning. He
wants you to call him.” '

John Wilson??! No big deal,
I mean, I’d only had a huge
crush on him for a month, even
though we hardly knew each oth-
er. A huge smile formed across
my face. “What was he calling
about?” '

“I’m not sure. He seemed
sweet. He left his number.”

I hadn’t received a call on the
home line since middle school. I
decided not to get my hopes up;
it was probably school-related,
even though we were in none of
the same classes. Maybe he had
a question about student govem-
ment or needed a lift to school?
I was somewhat confused, but
after reciting, “Hi Mr./ Mrs. Wil-
son, this is Campbell Burr; is
John available?” and a casual,
“Hey John, what’s up?” a few
dozen times, I took the leap and
called the dream boy back.

Our conversation went sur-
prisingly well, minus the pause
between the exchange of “what’s

up’”s and the “I was wonder-

ing if you wanted to hang out at

some point this weekend.” I had
to take a breath. Hang out?? This
random boy who I had spent way
too many hours Facebook stalk-
ing wanted to go out with me?! I
took a breath and followed with
a nonchalant, “Yeah, sure That
would be fun.”

He suggested lunch in town,
which made me even happier and
a bit relieved. After all, “hang
out” to many boys means “movie
in dark basement when your par-
ents aren’t home.” I accepted, in-
sisting that we wait a bit because I
had “to ﬁnish something at home
ﬁrst.” I had over an hours worth
of hair straightening, wardrobe
grazing and Listerine gargling to
do.

We met at a casual sandwich
place in town. John and I didn’t
have that much to talk about. We
were in different friend circles,
played different sports and had
only talked to each other maybe
twice atrcrowded football games.

I stuck with the basic ques-
tions to keep the conversation
going: siblings, where he was
looking for college. (I had trou-
ble remembering that it was not
every juniorfs favorite topic...)
I may have even gone. as low
as talking about teachers and
classes, I was starting to hope my
phone would ring. John brought a
bottle of soda to the cash register.
“Aren’t you ordering?” I asked.

“Nope, ate at home.”

Perfect! 1 love people watch- I

ing me eat! Especially boys that
I’m trying to impress. How did
he know?

As if that wasn’t bad enough,
he left me to pay for my over-
dressed salad. Ouch.

We sat down. I was so preoc-
cupied with eating neatly that I
could hardly focus on the con-
versation. I crunched on crou-
tons while John’s eyes rotated
from my eyes to my chest to his
phone.

Halfway through my salad,
John slammed his empty Coke
bottle on the table and announced,
“Well, I have some stuff to do at
home, so I need to go.” Was this
boy out of his mind? Ask me to
lunch, don’t eat, then after ﬁfteen
minutes decide you have some-
thing to do. He was becoming
less attractive by the second.

I assumed that he was not in-
terested in me. Whatever, I could
cope with disappointment. But
as we were about to part ways,
he reached out and hugged me.
“Would you like to see a movie
tomorrow aftemoon?”

SEE A MOVIE?! No, I don’t
want to give up three hours of a
beautiful Sunday to sit in "a dark
movie theater and-... not make
out with you. I told him I was
busy.

Boys, listen up. First dates are
simple and should be fun. Here
are a few guidelines:

1. Call the girl. It projects
conﬁdence. If you want to show

more conﬁdence, call a girl you
hardly know on her home phone
early on a weekend morning.

2. Be appropriate. Pick a rea-
sonable movie that interests both
of you, nothing too violent or too
sexual. Also choose your car mu-
sic carefully. One boy had made
a special country CD just for our
date. It was adorable... until he
told me he had a funny song for
me to hear and proceeded to turn
on a vile, very offensive rap song.
Yeah... the boy didn’t even get a
good night kiss...

3. Eat. I’ve been on two
dates where the boy “isn’t hun-
gry.” Most girls don’t head out
to dates starving. Often, neither
person is hungry. So don’t leave
the girl to suffer on her own with
a plate full of random stuff she
ordered in the midst of panic
when she heard you weren’t
getting anything. Suggest split-
ting something. And don’t ever
take the “Well, if neither of us is
hungry, let’s just chill in my car”
route... It won’t end the way you

_ planned it to...

Lexington is ﬁlled with fun
restaurants and ice cream par-
lors. Boys, you don’t even have
to deal with parents or a home
phone. Use the gifts Washing-
ton and Lee has given you. Need
practice? My number’s on Face-
book.

Washington and Lee takes

While many take advantage of
these opportunities, the commu-

Junior Gillian Sacks, along
with Allison Ferrara, is one of the
current captains of W&L’s club
cheerleading team. Like most
students, she has mastered the art
of time-management and multi-

tasking. However, Sacks tact-
fully balances the “push and
pull” of her commitments with
efﬁciency and energy. Hailing
from Little Rock, Arkansas,
she began cheering at the age
of ten and hasn’t stopped en-
joying it since.’

Phi: How long have you
been involved in W&L cheer-
leading? '

Sacks: I began cheering

so 3 years now.

Phi: Why did you choose
to cheer at W&L?

Sacks: I hadn’t intended
on cheering once I got to col-
lege, but it had become such
an integral part of my life, I
couldn’t give it up yet.

Phi: What is your favorite
aspect of cheerleading?

Sacks: Even though I’ve

grown up a lot during the time
in which I started cheering, I re-
ally love the friendships and the
bonds created while being on the
squad. When I first started cheer-

about being friends with girls I

Sacks: Cheerleaders are sup-

If we’re winning, we try to keep
it that way.

Jewelry sale bedazzles campus

Designer Katie Thompson shares "her pieces from ktcollection with the women (and men) of Washington and Lee

By Holly Suthers
ARTS 81 LIFE EDITOR

Washington and Lee students
take advantage of any opportuni-
ty to “swipe it home,” especially
when the product is as enticing
as the opportunity to pay out of
pocket. This past week, Katie
Thompson sold her handmade
jewelry on campus from her
business, ktcollection.

Students admired and pur-
chased the beautiful pieces for
two days in front of the Elrod
Commons. Thompson, "a native
of Lexington, also took the time
to get to know various customers
on campus. While she does not
usually show herjewelry on col-
lege campuses, she makes a spe-
cial effort to visit W&L.

“I only come to W&L be-
cause I grew up in Lexington,
my parents live in Lexington and
I always love an excuse to come
home. I also love working with
the University Store. They are re-
ally accommodating and so nice
to do business with,” Thompson
said.

The designer began making
jewelry at the age of 10, and even
sold her products to a local store.
However, Thompson did not be-
come serious about owning her
own business until her career in
the magazine industry inadver-
tently led her to create a career in
jewelry design. After moving to
New York City, she began mak-

ing jewelry for herself in order
to inexpensively add a sense of
ﬂair to her wardrobe. When more
and more people took notice of
her handmade designs, she and
her husband opened up a stand in
the East Village to sell her pieces
part time.

Her success encouraged her
to continue with her hobby, but
after leaving the magazine indus-
try and receiving her masters in
European politics, she said she
realized that her possible career
options were limiting to what she
wanted to focus on in life.

“I chose to stick with the jew-
elry as it offered a great lifestyle
for our family. My husband,

Zoubir, joined the business and
we haven’t stopped since. We
work really hard, but we love it
because we have flexibility in
our lives: we can usually pick
our two children up from school,
we get to dictate our own hours
and choose where and when we
want to work.”

Pieces from_ ktcollection have
been worn by Drew Barrymore,
Giselle Bundchen, Tori Spelling
and Amy Adams. Thompson said
that her designs are inspired by
the fashion world of New York
City and from the experiences
she has had while traveling the
world.

W&L alums Helen Coupe,

Paten Hughes and Jenna Wor-
sham currently work for her, and
enjoy it because it allows each of
them to pursue their own career
paths with a part-time job on the

* side.‘ They have also said that it

provides them with a sense of
family, which is not a common
sentiment to find in the city.

While Thompson’s visits are
meant for business, she is always
able to combine pleasure with
it through her interactions with
the W&L women. After this past
weeks successful visit, Thomp-
son hopes to return to campus
this spring.

“I really enjoy selling to
W&L women. They know what

they like. I find that they are pret-
ty adventurous in accessorizing
and that they have cosmopolitan
taste. Plus, they are just fun and
interesting women to talk to.”

 Field hockey mops up Marlins

The Generals’ ﬁeld hockey team be-
gan their voyage to the ODAC tourna-
ment with a win over the Virginia Wes-
leyan Marlins on Saturday afternoon
6-2. Four Generals scored to secure their
ﬁrst home ﬁeld win.

“It feels great,” Coach Wendy Orri-

son said. “It’s setting the right tone for
the season. It was a great team effort.”
The battle began early in the ﬁrst
half, with the Generals not letting the
Marlins’ goalkeeper even catch her
breath after the warm-up.
“We were dominating and getting

a lot of shots,” said sophomore Emily
Kunkel. “We were playing really scrap-
py, and once we ﬁnally got it in [the
goal], we knew we could keep doing it.
It was a real conﬁdence boost.”

Kunkel began the scoring spree for
the Generals 20 minutes into the game.

The field hockey team dominated over Virginia Wesleyan on Saturday, scoring four goals in the first
half. The girls kept the Marlins on their toes, trying out new plays during the second half.

Sophomore Annie Stevenson followed
with a goal of her own just two minutes
later. Three minutes later, senior defend-
er Jennie Norcini scored her ﬁrst goal of
the season off of a penalty corner.

“I did feel very pressured, but I tried
not to think about it,” she said. “I don’t
practice them, so that way I don’t over-
think them during a game.”

Senior forward Kelly Tran scored
just before the break giving the Gener-
als a 4-0 lead at halftime. W&L had 23
shots in the ﬁrst half keeping Virginia
Wesleyan’s goalkeeper on her toes.

The scoring continued into the sec-
ond half with Stevenson’s second goal,
but the Marlins scored 52 minutes into
the game after converting a penalty
corner. “There were a couple of times
when our heads were down, but we got
them back up,” said ﬁrst-year defender
Riley Hampsch.

Tran scored her second goal of the
game off an assist from junior mid-
ﬁelder Christina Benedetti with fewer
than three minutes left in the game. The
Marlins’ game was not over though.
With fewer than 30 seconds left on the
clock, Virginia.Wesleyan was awarded
a penalty corner that wasn’t executed
until time expired. Three corners were
executed while time was expired before
the Marlins scored their second and ﬁ-
nal goal.

“We tried a lot of new things in the
second half, so tliat’s probably the rea-
son we didn‘t look as good, but it was
great to try them out,” said Norcini.

The defense played a really strong
game, allowing only ﬁve shots and four

penalty corners on the game—compared
to W&L’s 40 shots and 14 penalty cor-

ners. “Coach Alexander has been con-
stantly correcting us on getting a player
after shot and it’s really helped [us on
defense],” said Norcini. “We still need
to work on defensive comers though.”

. “After a tough loss against Hopkins
[on Sunday], this game was a great way
for the team to really come together and
prove to each other that we can do this,”
Kunkel said. “We’re on the right track
now and we aren’t going to give in until
we make it to the ﬁnals.”

Hampsch is currently the only ﬁrst-
year starting for the Generals and has
really made an impact on the defensive
end coming up with many interceptions
and two defensive saves on the season.

“I tell myself, ‘I better not screw up,’
because most of the time I’m the last line
of defense, and if I screw up, I’m the last
resort,” she said. “It’s terrifying, honest-
ly. I wasn’t expecting to play, so getting
playing time is kind ofa bonus.”

The Generals are looking forward
to the challenging games ahead in the
ODAC schedule, including next week-
end’s games against Sweet Briar (Friday
at 7 p.m.) and non-conference game
against Mary Washington (Sunday at 2
p.m.). “lt’s gonna be hard,” said Norcini.
“We deﬁnitely have the potential to have
home ﬁeld advantage up to the ﬁnals.”
