‘L Healthy

minds

New student organizatition
promotes mental health

By Colleen Moore
STAFF WRITER

Catching a cold is almost inevitable in the fall or
winter, but most people know exactly how to treat
such a common illness. And yet, when it comes to
mental illness, few students know how to address
the related complications.

Fear of the words “depressed” or “bulimic” of-
ten prevents the education that will help a friend,
teammate or classmate suffering from a diagnosable
disease. Active Minds, a new organization at Wash-
ington and Lee, works to bring awareness to mental
health issues on campus and to lessen the stigma as-
sociated with them.

Active Minds was initiated last winter under the
direction of Dr. Christy Barongan, a clinical psy-
chologist in the W&L counseling center. Barongan
said she organized this student-led organization in
an effort to dispel myths surrounding Inental health.

Barongan said she hopes that ending the stigma
attached to mental illness will help students open
their eyes to prevalent issues on campus.

Acitve Minds President Lauren Ashley Tipton, is
ajunior pre-med student who plans to dedicate her
life to helping people affected by mental health is-
sues.

“People absolutely fascinate me, and I honestly
love, love, love to help them through listening and
just being a person they can count on to respect them
unconditionally,” Tipton said.

Tipton said she wants to provide the resources
necessary to help both students who are struggling,
as well as educate others to recognize a situation as
serious as a mental illness. Active Minds will orga-
nize and sponsor mental-health related panels and
speakers.

Members of the organization will also encour-
age balancing the programs with small gestures to
spread happiness. ,

Students who want to get involved in Active
Minds can contact Tipton or pick up an application
at one of their programs.

 mg flu outbreaks

Health Center oﬂers vaccines to ﬁght both swine ﬂu and normal strains

By Samuel Smith
STAFF WRITER

After multiple years of “swine
ﬂu” paranoia, the Health Center is
going above and beyond to prevent
another mass outbreak of swine ﬂu
on campus.

Every Wednesday from Oct. 6 to
Oct. 27, the Health Center is offer-
ing weekly “vaccine clinics.” The
vaccine itself is available at anytime
during the day, and no appointment
is required. '

Although the vaccine is not re-
quired of Health Center employees
nor work-study students, many of
those students and nurses have al-
ready taken precautions and have
been inoculated.

The 2009 HINI virus, or “swine
ﬂu," was a new and more powerful
strain of the seasonal inﬂuenza virus.
In response to HINI, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services

‘issued a “nationwide public health

emergency declaration” on its web-
site on April 26, 2009. At ﬁrst, only
a few international travelers were
stricken by the new virus, but con-
tainment efforts failed. The virus
spread until the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) declared it a “global
pandemic.”

The American media showed con-
stant coverage of the virus from the
ﬁrst conﬁrmed cases both worldwide

and nationwide, to the ﬁrst American
fatalities, to the closure of schools,
to the around-the-clock efforts of the
US. Government to ﬁnd a vaccine.

American schools were particu-
larly hard hit by the swine ﬂu, and
Washington and Lee University was
no exception. W&L had almost a
dozen conﬁrmed cases last spring.

According to an article in the
W&L archives, in May 2009 the
“Virginia Department of Health had
conﬁrmed ll cases of the HINI
inﬂuenza among patients” in the
Health Center.

Nurses likened the amount of
sickness to just another busy ﬂu sea-

son, and apart from the ferocity of
the HINI virus, didn’t see too much
different in it than the seasonal ﬂu.

First-year Allison Swagler chose
to get the ﬂu vaccine because she
doesn’t want to “get sick.” The swine
ﬂu outbreak didn’t really inﬂuence
her decision because she “always
gets [the ﬂu]”.

On the other hand, ﬁrst-year Eric
Notari chose to opt out of the ﬂu vac-
cine this year.

“I never get ﬂu shots. I’ll take my
chances with getting the ﬂu. I haven’t
had it yet, so I’m not going to change
it up this year,” said Notari.

Student athletes succeed

Two alumnae spoke about the lessons they learned as athletes at Washington and Lee

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR ‘

Playing a sport in college teaches
skills which give student athletes an
advantage in post-graduate life, ac-
cording to two recent Washington
and Lee alumnae.

Dr. Kelley Zagol, ’05, and Emily
Wolﬁng Heinauer, ’05, both former
W&L student athletes, delivered this
message as part of a panel discus-
sion focusing on women at W&L on
Thursday, Oct. 7. The discussion is
one ofﬁve events to be held this year
in a series titled “Leadership, Gender
and Community at Washington and
Lee.”

Around 40 people, mostly student
athletes, attended Zagol and Heinau-
er’s discussion. The pair talked about
the lessons they learned from being
athletes while maintaining a rigorous
academic schedule.

“To be a student athlete, you have

to do both,” said Zagol.

Zagol, a former soccer player, is
currently enrolled in a residency pro-
gram at the University of Virginia.
She said that her time at W&L taught
her that if she worked hard, she could
accomplish anything, a lesson she
has carried into her professional life.

Heinauer, who works for a de-
fense contractor, said that her W&L
experience gave her the conﬁdence
she needs in her job, especially be-
cause she is the only person under
the age of 30 there and often the only
woman in the room. “Sports give
you that conﬁdence to stand up and
say, ‘I have something to bring to the
table,’” Heinauer said. ,

After talking about their experi-
ences both at W&L and after col-
lege, Heinauer and Zagol ﬁelded
questions from the audience. In an-

swer to questions about how they got
the jobs they have now, the young
women talked about the importance
of ﬁnding ajob that you enjoy doing
rather than focusing on having ev-
erything planned out right away.
“After college life isn’t linear
anymore,” said Zagol. “If you hate
yourjob, do something else.”
Heinauer said she found her cur-
rentjob through Colonnade Connec-
tions. Like many seniors, Heinauer
was not sure what she wanted to do
after college, but she was able to ﬁnd
a great job thanks to the university’s
support system. '
“You don’t' have to know what
you want to do -forever,” Heinauer
said. “But there are people at your
ﬁngertips who are willing to help
you.”
Heinauer said that her varied ex-

periences at W&L gave her the edge
over other ‘applicants when looking
for a job. She said the opportunity
to play sports, succeed as a student,
and participate in other activities like
Greek life makes W&L graduates
unique.

“Not only are you smart enough
to do whatever you want to do. . .but
you also have all these other things
going for you that other people
don’t,” said Heinauer.

Both young women had nothing
but praise for the education and ex-
perience they received at W&L. “You
are a better professional because you
went to W&L,” said Zagol.

The War on Noise and its effect on off campus parties at W&L

By shutting down most parties before 11:30, the Lexington Police Department is crippling the school ’s future

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

For some reason, I started—fol—
lowing the news around April
2007. I was in another country
and had just discovered pod-
casts, so it was nice to download
news videos that kept me up to
date with what I had been miss-
ing back home. Before then, I
hadn’t followed major national
news stories that intently, so
when “The McLaughlin. Group”
told me that there was a possible
housing crisis, I didn’t know

how big of a crisis that whole _

situation would become.

Around that time, the major
sentiment, at least in the media,
was thatthe housing market was
just at a down point in the cycle.
The only pundits delivering dark
and ominous messages were the
ones playing devil’s advocate;
they weren’t really taken seri-
ously.

The problem, like most major
economic problems developing

certainly has directly affected a
higher percentage of students. If
this problem goes unabated, this
school will be radically different
in the next few years. _
During this Homecoming
Weekend, just like every other
Homecoming Weekend, numer-
ous fraternities hosted parties
designed to rush freshmen and
entertain young alumni who
were returning to their alma ma-
ter for three days. The alcohol
and appetizers that were served
and the bands that were hired
all cost a fair amount of money,
and they served one purpose: to
keep the fraternity ﬁnancially
stable. Fraternities make money
from incoming freshmen pledges
and alumni donations. Everyone
knows that. But what everyone
might not realize is that these
fraternity parties are ultimately
investments designed to make
more money in the future. '

these werewolves of Lexington
is that’, quite simply, they shut
down parties. I’m not going to
bicker about the legality of shut-

.ting down parties before their

noise permits have expired. I’m
sure that’s already pretty well
covered (although, Law School,
did I ever tell you how nice you
look in that decrepit building
next to the football stadium?).

Instead, I’m going to talk
about the principle of the matter,
mostly because that’s how I can
best bullshit my case. By shutting
down these on-campus parties
with noise permits, the police are
depleting a part of Lexington’s
economy. I know LexPo prob-
ably doesn’t care for fraterni-
ties enjoying a proﬁt, but these
parties end up being a source of
income. So, yeah, you are cost-
ing legitimate businesses money.
Don’t know if that’s something
you really want to be doing.

never thought I would see the day
when it takes longer to download
a document in the library than for
the police to show up at the cab-
ins or polehouses. Houses have
been sound proofed and numbers
at parties have dwindled, yet the
police keep showing up.

This is around the time most
adults will tune out this article.
Having parents of my own, and
listening to my younger family
members complain about things,
I realize they have already shrunk
this article down to “Why won’t
the police let us have any fun?”
I get it. We are simply kids who
want to drink and break the law
without any repercussions. En-
joy the sports section, and I hope
your high horse doesn’t cause
you chafﬁng.

Now, for those of you still
reading, this is why the Lexing-
ton Police’s actions are wrong.
By the way, administration, I sin-

ing points as a university is that
our freshmen aren’t exposed
to the dangerous habit of binge
drinking in dorm rooms that has
plagued NESCAC schools for
years. Maybe LexPo is more
comfortable with unorganized
hall parties centered on shots
and pulls than pole parties with
kegs, but I’m certainly not. Also,
moving parties further and fur-
ther away from campus will all
but eliminate any of Traveller’s
positive effect. When kids can’t
use Traveller, they will resort to
drunk driving, and we all know
how that ended up.

I know there are proponents
of shutting down main sources
of alcohol to cut down on overly
drunken students, but I was lucky
enough to visit the Health Cen-
ter last Friday night. Let me tell
you, I’m pretty sure kids keep
drinking. If the War on Noise
becomes the success that LexPo

Ultimately, Washington and Lee is selling itself as a product, and for 18-year-old seniors in high school, part of that

product includes a social life. This active social life, coupled with an active academic life, is why most current students

during that time, was acknowl-
edged but neither acted upon nor
given appropriate concern. Ob-
viously, we didn’t know it then,
but the country as a whole would
drastically change in the next
few years.

I started to think a lot about
those podcasts during Home-
coming Weekend. No, it wasn’t
because I was sitting at home
watching “The McLaughlin
Group.” However, I’m starting
to get the feeling that Washing-
ton and Lee may have a little
developing crisis of its own.
The crisis is not nearly as bad
as the housing collapse, but it

I don’t think that I’m throw-
ing any economists for a loop by
saying all of this, but let me get
to my point. The Lexington Po-
lice broke up at least two of these
bands before their noise permits
expired. Anyone who was at Sig-
ma Chi’s dance floor on Friday
or Red Square’s dance ﬂoor on
Saturday must have had a much
shorter weekend than expected.
By shutting down these two par-
ties and shutting down countless
others due to the new, very vague
noise violation policy is causing
problems. And these problems
are only going to get worse.

The second problem cre-
ated by NWA’s muse is a much
broader one that has happened
throughout the year. I have never
been a huge fan of Windfall, but
as of right now, it’s an integral
part of Washington and Lee’s
culture. Serving as the second act
of the majority of party nights,
Windfall parties have been the
day-to-day constant for a major-
ity of students during their W&L
careers over the last couple of
years.

Every night features a differ-
ent theme and ﬂavor, but those
parties always end up funneling
towards Windfall. Windfall is
where the plot development hap-
pens. Where the story reaches its
apex. Where the nostalgia origi-
nates. Regardless of your inter-
ests, spending your career avoid-
ing Windfall is like never taking
an elective in college or meeting
Burr Datz. It’s something you
have to experience at least once.

The Lexington Police appar-
ently seemed so enthralled with
the magic of Windfall that they
have decided to come visit be-
tween 11 and 11:30 p.m. every
chance they get. According to
the people who live there, Lex-
Po’s daily presence on Windfall
is BPing the nightly gulf of stu-
dents. How can there be Wind-
fall late night, if the nights end
before it gets late?

Windfall isn’t the only victim
in Lexington’s War on Noise. 1

cerely hope you are listening—
this affects you too.

All students who live off
campus realize that they neigh-
bor the same areas as families
and responsible adults who don’t
treat Wednesday evenings with
the same vigor. I’m all for mak-
ing sure that these families aren’t
disturbed by our fun. That’s why

noise violations exist, and that’s.

why we occasionally try to obey
them. However, by closing down
parties early, the Lexington Police
are forcing a very high number of
already drunk students, wired for
a sleepless night, to find a new
place to consume their liquor.
After this weekend, the were-
wolves made it abundantly clear
that partying at fraternity houses
is a no—go. A little side note: who
buys a house next to these giant
Greek monoliths without expect-
ing there to be some loud noise
at night? Lexington’s social edu-
cation must be lacking. Anyway,
these now drunk students are still
going to look for a place to party
after LexPo arrives, so what’s
going to happen? Either students
are going to start drinking earlier
and we’ll have people passed out
by the time Jeopardy airs or new
places will become popular.
These two places are either
going to be in the freshman
dorms or further out into the
country. Of these two places, I’m
not really sure that W&L wants
either of them. One of our sell-

hopes it will be, binge drinking
and drunk driving numbers will
increase. Have fun with that PR
nightmare, Ruscio.

The second problem cre-
ated by the vultures with sirens
is harder to decipher. Because
I’m a Democrat who still de-
fends Obama, I’ve had one idea
pounded in my head more times
than I care to say. In the end, it’s
all about the money. See, that’s
why I don’t hate the Lexington
Police Department. They are
wisely jumping on the cash cow
that is the W and L student. We
are walking disposable incomes,
and every parking ticket, speed-
ing ticket for the family and
drunk in public is just as much
of a money making venture as
is defending the public from the
evils of 18-21 year olds. I know
that I’m about to be called “the
spoiled little I‘*** who thinks he’s
entitled to everything,” but when
it comes down to it, us spoiled
little brats are either the most
dangerous people in Lexington,
or we help subsidize some qual-
ity dental coverage. Either way,
I’m not sure if I’m really com-
fortable with the situation.

This is not just the students’
problem either. Like the hous-
ing crisis, the War on Noise is
going to affect the entire W and
L community. The university
raises money through the year-
ly influx of new freshmen and
through alumni donations, which

actually resembles how the pros-
ecuted fraternities make money
(English majors, this is what
you call bringing it full circle).
After seeing some of the faces
of the young alumni members
this weekend, I think cancelling
bands before 11:30 p.m. worked
about as well in your favor as
paying Wale $36,000 for a one
hour set on a Thursday before
a day. of tests for many classes.
Plus, as the Lexington Police
shuts more and more houses
down earlier and earlier, word is
going to get out. ,
Ultimately, W and L is selling
itself as a product, and for 18-
year-old seniors in high school,
part of that product includes a
social life. This active social life,
coupled with an active academic
life, is why most current students
chose to attend this school. Take
the social life away, and we’re a
certain school in North Carolina
without the Division I basketball
team. Parents aren’t going to
want to send their kids to schools
where they know that they’ll
most likely have some meaning-
less mark on their record because
god forbid they had a beer on a
Saturday night. Future students
aren’t going to want to go to a
school where the curfew is 11:30
p.m. or where every party sud-
denly becomes a silent movie
after midnight. Donations will
dwindle, applications, will de-
crease, and before it knows what
happened, W and L will be star-

ing September 2008 right in the

face.

All of these negative conse-
quences are possible because the
biggest problem in Rockbridge
County right now is an excess of
noise. I would love to think that
I was horribly ignorant about the
real situation going on in Lex-
ington. I would also love if some
kind of peace agreement could
come between the warring par-
ties of the Lexington Police De-
partment and the students of W
and L. I think that, if students are
given select spots where they can
entertain themselves until at least
1 am, there really won’t be too
many more problems. I’m just
not sure ifthat will happen.

I feel like one of the dev-
il’s advocate pundits on “The
McLaughlin Group.” This will
be read by the students and cared
about, and the only action that
will be taken will be more ap-
peasing to our obviously base-
less complaints. Like I already
pointed out, the adults stopped
reading a long time ago. So with
that, I’ll end with two words for
LexPo. Well, I think Cee-Lo
already said it best on his new
single.

Rapper headlines GAB conce

Wale performs in front of hundreds of students last Thursday at the Pavilion

By Holly Suthers
surr wamzn

“Yeah they keep sayin’ whale,
but my name is Wale.”

This lyric was heard by hun-

dreds of students last Thursday
night at the Pavilion. The con-
cert, sponsored by the Generals
Activities Board, featured the
rapper Wale.
, Known for his songs
“Chillin”’ and “Pretty Girls,” the
‘rapper put on a successful per-
forrnance.

_ “It was really fun and the stu-
dents had a great time dancing to
his beats,” said senior Catharine
Gregorie.

Relatively new to the music
scene, Wale reached his highest
point of success in 2009 with the
release of his album Attention
Deficit. The album contains his
three singles “Pretty Girls featur-
ing Lady Gaga,” “Chillin” and
“World Tour.” The rapper stated
in an interview with Blues and
Soul that he chose the contro-
versial title in order to reﬂect the
various ideas that are expressed
in his lyrics.

Even though Wale is typically
considered a rapper, he has in-
corporated the newgenre Go-Go
Music into his songs. Go-Go mu-
sic is described as a raw, percus-
sion-driven genre that is similar
to disco. It originated in Wash-

ington D.C. and is still popular
in the area.

to Washington D.C. at a young
age, the rapper continues to live
in the area. He also attended Vir-

from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The menu has a wide variety

of Grecian specialties like Spana-

The interior of the building is

spacious, but also creates a wan'n
family atmosphere. The walls
are lined with black-and-white
pictures of Lexington, creating a
local ambience. There is a wide
array of seating and has the ca-
pacity to easily host large private
functions. The menu is also fair-
ly priced and provides a quality
product.

My recent visit to Niko’s was
delightful to say the least. The
service was wonderful and the
food was delicious. Our wait-

ress was extremely attentive and
catered to every whim. After
speaking with other diners, the
high quality of the service was
agreed on by all.

The food was also as good as
the service. I ordered the Spana-
kopita, a Greek dish of spinach
and feta cheese baked in ﬁlo
dough, and received an extreme-
ly large portion. The entree also
came with a side Greek salad and
hummus and pita bread, all for
just $12.95. My friends ordered

the Gyro Platter, the Gyro, and
the Chicken Kabob and all said
that they thoroughly enjoyed
their meals, as well.

While I have not eaten break-
fast at Niko’s, l have spoken to
a few people who frequently
visit the downtown eatery in the
early morning because ofthe low
prices and variety of breakfast
plates.

As most students will admit,
it is easy to become tired of the
few restaurant options in the city.

However, Niko’s diverse menu
and long hours are a welcomed
attribute to Lexington.

As a local family business,
Niko’s Grill is a wonderful op-
tion for a casual dining experi-
ence that is close to campus.
Take-out is available for those
who are unable to take the time
to dine-in, but I strongly encour-
age the community to go in,
enjoy the ambience, talk to the
friendly waiters and havea deli-
cious meal.

Self-defense event comes to campus

Three Greek organizations bring TAKE to campus to teach self-defense to students

By Elenaor Kennedy
STAFF WRITER

After months of planning and
fundraising, TAKE Self—Defense
is coming to Washington and Lee
on Oct. 23 to teach young women
how to deal with dangerous situ-
ations. . ‘

TAKE, which stands for The
Ali Kemp Educational Founda-
tion, was founded in honor of
Ali Kemp, a sister of Pi Beta Phi
whose life was cut short between
her freshmen and sophomore
years of college.

Kemp’s parents founded TAKE
to prevent tragedies like this from
happening to anyone else. Since it
was founded in'2005, over 20,000
women ages 12 and older have
been trained. The class is free,
and participants also receive a
handbook with more useful self-
defense tips.

Senior Christina Torres, Pi
Phi’s vice president of event plan-
ning, spearheaded the effort to
bring TAKE to W&L.

In order to bring TAKE here,

   

Di

Torres submitted a bid with an
explanation of how TAKE would
beneﬁt our campus and commit-
ted to raise the necessary funds.
TAKE costs every campus it visits
over $2000.

Two other Greek organizations .

on campus, Alpha Delta Pi and

Sigma Phi Epsilon, are helping Pi _

Phi with this massive undertaking.
Together the three organizations
are working to raise the money in
a number of diverse ways. T-shirts
will be sold in the weeks leading
up to the class, and local restau-
rants are hosting nights where all
proceeds go to support TAKE.

During Parents’ Weekend par-
ents can pick up a tasty treat from
their kids and support a good
cause at the same time as part of a
cookie sale to raise money.

Although TAKE is just a one
day event, Christina said she sees
the event as a good ﬁrst step for
women on campus. “Knowledge
is power,” she said.

. Volleyball sweeps Sweet Briar

Vixens helpless against W&L teamwork and unity; a team total of 3 6 kills powers the women to victory

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF wmrzn

The women of the Washington and
Lee volleyball team dominated in their
3-0 victory over Sweet Briar College on
Wednesday night.

The Generals won the ﬁrst set 25-8,
the second 25-9, and the third 25-10 as
the Generals improved to 13-2 for the
season.

Teamwork and unity were evident af-
ter every play throughout the match. Af-

ter every point that they scored, the spir-
ited W&L players huddled together in
the middle ofthe court to yell, cheer and
sometimes even dance together, much to
the delight of the fans who came to sup-
port the team.

“Oh my gosh, I love when they do
that little dance,” said one clearly enter-
tained spectator.

' The players on the sidelines were

equally enthusiastic, making sure to
high ﬁve every player that subbed out of
the game as she returned to the bench.

Although the match was not the most
competitive the Generals have played
this year, they never lost their focus or
allowed their play to get sloppy.

“We did really well playing our own
game and keeping our own pace,” said
sophomore Taylor Maxey of her team’s

performance on the court.
‘ In contrast to the noticeable unity on

. the blue and white side of the court, the

Sweet Briar team seemed to be plagued
by a lack of communication. More
than once, multiple Sweet Briar players
made a move towards the ball before si-
multaneously backing away as it hit the
ground, each player expecting the others
to get the ball. Toward the end of the

second set, the frustration was visible on
the faces of the Sweet Briar players.

While many W&L players perfonned
solidly, two freshmen outside hitters had
a notably strong showing. M.A. Boles
ﬁnished the game with 11 kills, and Al-
lison Rouse was right behind her with
10.

Women’s soccer downs Hollins 4-O  

The Generals extend their winning streak to three games following Wednesday is victory over a conference rival

By Barbara Knipp

This past Wednesday, Oct. 6, the
Generals Women’s Soccer team defeat-
ed Hollins in an aftemoon game at their
home ﬁeld. Clearly the faster and more
athletic team, the Generals dominated
both halves of the game. They were the
ﬁrst to every ball, which ensured that
they maintained possession. Junior de-
fender Page Minton explained that this
is a skill that they “try to engrain from
the beginning of the season because be-
ing ﬁrst to balls spurs offense.”

With more than ten shots on goal in-

each half and close to thirty the entire
game, the Generals kept their opponents

‘ '35.?‘ i-"!21)“I.,‘@W.‘A‘{‘B9'l%"!‘,'X}'tdK?1$.T‘T'%l!.'v. 3‘

defense constantly on their toes. On
the other hand, if a green Hollins jersey
managed to approach the Washington
and Lee goalie, General’s defense suc-
ceeded in clearing the ball each time.
Minton, the General’s sweeper, stood as
the last line of defense against Hollins’s
offense. She ensured that no one entered
the box, making the game fairly boring
for the goalies.

Throughout the entire game, the Gen-
erals showed unparalleled communica-
tion skills. One could hear shouts of en-
couragement and instruction non-stop,
especially from senior captain Caroline

ended the day with an assist on a goal.

Lamberti. Minton commented, “Com-
munication has been one of the areas
that has been up and down this season,
and I think that we were playing a new
formation... We knew that communica-
tion was key to understanding the new
formation and being prepared to play
it against Lynchburg." Thanks to solid
hustle and communication, the Generals
succeeded in scoring three goals before
halftime. Two of the goals were scored
with only a fewminutes left in the half
by senior Taylor Garrett.

They were more offensive and always
ﬁrst to the ball in the first half, but in the

\

second half the ball was in the middle
ofthe ﬁeld more often. Minton explains
that it was because “games like that are
tough because they pack a lot of people
in the box, and we aren’t scoring.” The
home team proceeded to take a shot on
the Hollins goalie before a whistle was
blown in the second half. There was less
scoring in the second half, however they
continued to take multiple shots. Hollins
was denied a single shot on goal.
Fitness is one of the team’s strengths,
and the Generals look forward to a prom-
ising season. Two freshmen joined the
team, and have seen time on the ﬁeld,

adding “depth,” as Minton described.
After this week the team is focusing
on getting accustomed to the new for-
mation and strengthening the on-ﬁeld
support system. Team cohesion on and
off the ﬁeld continues to be a main com-
ponent to the successof the women’s
soccer team. The team looks forward
to improving upon their new formation
and is ready to face future opponents.

SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee football team
put on an exciting and dominating show
Saturday, beating conference-rival Emory
& Henry College 45-24 in front of an ap-
preciative Homecoming crowd.

For the third consecutive week, sopho—.

more running back Luke Heinsolm rushed

 

      

W&L gave up an early touchdown
to the Wasps in the 1st quarter and still
trailed 7-3 by the start of the 2nd quar-
ter. That was until Murray had a 52-yard
touchdown run just over 2 minutes into
the 2nd. That was followed by two more
General touchdowns.

The defense also had an outstanding
day. E&H boasts a 1st Team All-American
running back on their team. W&L held
him to only 69 yards on Saturday, well be-
low his 145 yards per game average prior
to Saturday.

more running back, Brett Murray. also
broke the century mark.

As a team, the Generals rushed for 425

where they have accumula_tcd over 400
rushing yards.

   

Junior ‘quarterback Charlie Westfal
found first-year tight end Alex Evans on
a 6-yard pass for a score that ended an 86-
yard drive.

Sophomore defensive back Jake Pelton
intercepted E&H, in the end zone on the
ensuing drive, and the Generals capped
the resulting possession with an 8-yard
touchdown run by Westfal to ﬁnish out the
half. W&L went into the ‘half with a 24-7
lead as junior place kicker connected on
each of his extra-point attempts.

Just over two minutes into the third
quarter Westfal found Murray again‘ for a
17-yard touchdown pass to add to the al-
ready impressive lead.

The Wasps managed to put up 10 points
in the third quarter, but the Generals an-
swered with two more touchdowns in the

‘ fourth quarter to put the game out of reach

for Emory & Henry. The ﬁrst was a l-yard
run by Heinsohn, and the second a 6-yard
by Murray. '

more defensiveback Jake Pelton added
eight stops, along with two pass breakups
and one interception. The team also forced
and recovered two fumbles.

Senior captain and defensive lineman
Colin Campbell summed up the game say-
ing, “It was a big win...having the crowd
and alumni here deﬁnitely added to the
motivation to win.” Still reeling from the
excitement of the game, Campbell added,
“I can’t say enough about the offense and
defense today. They were great.”

The Generals improved to 3-2 on the
season and 2-0 in conference play. Wash-
ington and Lee plays again Saturday as
24th-ranked Randolph-Macon comes to
Lexington for a l:00 pm contest.

Homecoming queen was awarded to Elsa Friis during half-time of C
Saturday’s football game. She was selected out of six finalists.
