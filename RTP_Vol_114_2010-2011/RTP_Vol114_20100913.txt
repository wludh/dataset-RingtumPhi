Helping
orphans ﬁnd
homes

Senior Elizabeth Gorman 3*
Summer in Ghana,

By Lizz Dye
STAFF w R ITER

While most Washington and Lee students spent
their summers slaving away in mundane internships
and nine-to-ﬁvejobs, senior Elizabeth Gorman spent
her summer working at orphanages in Ghana.

Gorman worked as a KaeMe Summer Intern.
KaeMe, which means “remember me” in Twi, is a
non-governmental organization whose mission is to
give every orphan and vulnerable child in Ghana a
loving and supportive family.

Although many NGOs in Africa have a similar
goal in mind, KaeMe realizes that the orphans in
Ghana face a unique situation. While other NGOs
focus on orphans who have lost parents to AIDs,
sixty percent ofthe orphans KaeMe serves have liv-
ing parents. _ -

Many of these children’s parents left them in the
hope that an orphanage education would ultimately
be better for their child. Despite these hopes, empiri-
cal research has shown that children have develop-
mental delays when placed in orphanages.

In order to address this problem, the Ghana De-
partment ofSocial Welfare has replaced many ill-run
children’s homes with a type of community center.
where families have access to food, clothing and ed-
ucation without giving up custody of their children.

Gorman worked at KaeMe as the organization

was first working in the ﬁeld, so she spent most of

heritime proﬁling children at the children’s homes.
She and her fellow interns worked with three recent
graduates of the social welfare program at the Uni-
versity of Ghana, Legon.

While the interns conducted an informal inter-
view, which consisted mainly of playing with the
younger children and asking about the likes, dislikes
and ambitions ofthe older children, the social work-
ers conducted formal interviews in the children’s na-

their past both at home and in orphanages.

Gorrnan’s group also scanned their existing ﬁles,
which ranged from a few scant pages to all-inclusive
proﬁles with family pictures, medical records and
school reports. <

The ultimate goal of KaeMe within the next fou
to ﬁve years is to ensure that each child has an ex-
tensive ﬁle in order to assess all ofthe children with
more accuracy.

With these nevi/gand improved ﬁles, the Depart-
ment of Social Welfare can work with adoption
agencies domestically and internationally more ef-

ﬁciently so that more children can be adopted or‘

placed with other family members.

Gorman said that she gained “a feeling of em-
powerment” from her experience. “Everyone can
make a difference ifthey put the effort in.”

New Volunteer Venture trip
explores healthcare in Ric/zmond

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

On August 30th, ten ﬁrst-years,
three sophomores and onejunior set
out for ﬁve days of service, learning
and bonding in Richmond as part of
the newest Volunteer Venture pre-
orientation program.

According to Volunteer Venture
coordinator senior Kara Karcher,

the Richmond trip focused on ‘‘ac- ‘

cess to healthcare in relation to pov-
erty.” Karcher said that Richmond is
known for its great healthcare sys-
tem, and it made particular sense to
create a trip with a medical focus in
light of the recent debates about na-
tional healthcare policy.

According to one of the Rich-
mond trip cooidinators, junior Shiri
Yadlin, the medical focus was a
major draw for incoming students.
“We had a lot of bio majors,” said
Yadlin. ‘

Students on the trip spent most
of their time visiting free clinics,
community centers and nonproﬁt
organizations that aim to provide
healthcare to the less fortunate, Yad-
lin said. Students helped out these
organizations by weeding, stufﬁng
sex-ed packets and cleaning out a
cluttered gym, a project which Yad-
lin said produced “a very dramatic
change.”

First-year Nicole Gunawansa
chose the Richmond trip because
she knew she wanted a service-re-
lated trip and she plans to pursue
medicine.

Gunawansa said one of her fa-
vorite visits was to the International
Children’s Hospital, where students
got to meet children of immigrants
from developing countries. She par-
ticularly remembered a seven year-
old who was about to undergo heart
surgery. She said it was “really neat"

to hear about the children’s experi-
ences ﬁrsthand.

Although Gunawansa and Yadlin
both said the trip was a success, they
admitted that there is room for im-
provement. Because the clinics the
students visited had limited work
available for non-medical profes-
sionals, many ofthe visits were more
observational than participatory.“We
couldn’t do as much hands-on as we
wanted,” said Gunawansa.

But Yadlin sees this lack of
hands-on volunteering as a challenge
that she is eager to meet. “That’s one
thing I’m hoping for next year... to
do more service work,” she said.

Although this was the Richmond
trip’s ﬁrst year, the coordinators are
conﬁdent that it will continue in the
future. “The Richmond trip lead-
ers laid the foundation for the trip
to continue in future years,” said
Karcher, “and next year we hope to
increase the number of students that
will be able to participate.”

Karcher, who went on a.,Volun-
teer Venture trip her ﬁrst year at
Washington and Lee, said she stayed
involved in the program because of
the great effect it had on her W&L
career. .

“I met and become friends with
my leaders and fellow participants,”
said Karcher, “but also found out
about programs like the Shepherd
Poverty and Bonnet Leader pro-
grams that I am still involved with
to this day.” '

Like Karcher, Yadlin says she
likes that the program provides ﬁrst-
years with an introduction the Shep-
herd Poverty program. “It was re-
ally cool for me to see the ﬁrst years
grasp the concepts of poverty,” Yad-
lin said.

Of course, Volunteer Venture is
also a great opportunity for incom-
ing ﬁrst-years to make new friends.
Gunawansa appreciated the intro-
duction to what the Shepherd pro-
gram teaches, but she also said that

\&

it was great to meet people with
similar interests. _

v“I made some really close
friends,” Gunawansa said. “It really
helped me coming in.”

Matarese said his experi-
ence was made even better by
the cultural exposure he enjoyed
through his host family.

He lived in a hostel whose
owner was also principal of the
school where he taught. The two
directors of education for the
program were also Ecuadorean
and were therefore more attuned
to the exact needs of the com-
munity.

The rural nature of Otavalo
impacts how students make it to
school. Houses are spread across
miles of farmland, so some stu-
dents must walk up and down
foothills and dirt roads for over

O-week: more than just parties

F rosh do community service around Rockbridge Co. in new orientation event

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

On September 9, while most
upperclassmen were tucked com-
fortably in their beds, recovering
from a little too much fun the
night before, Washington and
Lee’s newest students ventured
out into the community for a day
of service. ‘

Due to the timing of the
Jewish new year, Rosh Hasha-
nah, the ﬁrst day of classes was
pushed back from Thursday to
Friday. This change left a day
void of established Orientation
Week activities. A new activity
was created, one which would
expose ﬁrst-years to the needs

of the community they have just
entered.

According to junior resident
advisor Phil Jackson, 15 groups
of ﬁrst-year students spent three
hours Thursday morning doing
service everywhere from Lex-
ington to Buena Vista to Natural
Bridge. Jackson’s group painted
walls at a nursing home, while
some groups worked with Good-
will, Habitat for Humanity 0
Project Horizon. ‘

Although Jackson admitted
some students seemed unhappy
with the early morning hours,
he said that in the end “a lot of

people really enjoyed it.”

For ﬁrst-year Ashley Bishop,
the experience was “really cool.”
Her group worked at Habitat for
Humanity, painting and restock-
ing a library. Bishop said she
liked learning about Habitat for
Humanity programs as well as
having fun with her peers while
serving others.

Jackson said he saw the event
as valuable for W&L’s image. “It
is a good way to show that W&L-
students aren’t here just to party,”
he said.

Bishop said she liked the op-
portunity because it exposed her

and her peers to the world around
them. “A lot of people aren’t
from here so it really helped them
see what’s going on in the com-
munity,” said Bishop.

Can Weezer find true redemption in Hurley?

After a decade of selling out, Weezer is new album may be a step in the right direction

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N IST

For the greater part of the
21st century, Weezer has been
utter shit.

Pardon my language, but
there is no better way to describe
a band with a self-titled debut
that redeﬁned power pop and a
follow-up record that has been
labeled the “comerstone of the
late-nineties emo movement.”

While l994’s Weezer and
l996’s Pinkerton will likely nev-
er be matched, die-hard Weezer
fans have been waiting for a re-
turn to form as intently as Cubs
fans have been praying for a
World Series ring.

With each post-Pinkerton al-
bum came disappointment and
frustration.

(a close-up of actor Jorge Gar- ,

cia, who portrayed the charac-
ter Hugo “Hurley” Reyes from
Lost), Weezer’s newest album is
anything but a gimmicky throw-
away. First track and lead single
“Memories” kicks off Hurley
with a pounding bass line, sing-
along choruses and lyrics that re-
call Weezer’s mid-90’s heyday:
“Pissing in plastic cups before
we went on stage/ Playing hack-
eysack back when Audioslave
was still Rage.”

“Ruling Me” and “Brave
New World” are two power pop
bamburners that are pure, vin-
tage Weezer.

“Unspoken,” Cuomo croons, “I
can feel those metal chains/ And
they’re holding back the hope
that keeps me sane/ I can ﬁght

explodes into an climactic, ca-
thartic rush of guitar and drums
that recall the conclusion of
“Only in Dreams” off Weezer’s
debut.

While there may be more
highlights on Hurley than on
Weezer’s last two (or three) ef-
forts combined, there do remain

tracks such as “Wliere’s my
Sex?” This track is so absurdly
stupid that it makes the album’s
cover look like avant-garde art.
Spoiler: It’s a track about socks
that replaces the word socks with
sex. Seriously.

Although the better tracks on
the album recall and possibly ri-
val early Weezer, Hurley lacks
the cohesiveness and consisten-
cy ofa truly great album.

There are numerous flops on
the album, including the closer
“Time Flies,” a bland folk song
with lyrics that could have been
penned by a 13 year-old.

certainly deteriorated over the
years, as well. Songs like “El

of collapsing porches, Traveller
incidents and multiple snowpo-
calypses, it is imperative that we,
as a community, stick together
and continue the efforts we start-
ed to pursue last fall term.

Let’s not beat around the
bush. We all have heard of the
alarmingly high sexual assault
statistics on campus. Begrudg-
ingly or‘ not, we have accepted
this as part of life at W&L. But
it shouldn’t end at acceptance.
With one of the biggest party
weeks behind us, we must stay
constantly vigilant in our efforts
to change these statistics in the
coming year. I know we hear
about sexual assault all the time,
but we can’t just sweep it under

a somewhat integral part of the
W&L experience. Many of us
like to let loose, throw back a few
brews and dance the night away.
It’s a nice break from all of the
work we put in as students at one
of the most prestigious schools
in the nation. At the same time,
we must know our limits and
maintain some sort of control.
Upperclassmen know much
more than the frosh do about lim-
its and our culture here. There-
fore, while we all like to lose a
bit of control, we must keep an
eye out for potentially danger-
ous situations. If we notice a girl
or guy stumbling around, obvi-
ously a little too intoxicated, we
can spare a few moments to ask

about her or his well-being. You
could be their hero of the night—
who knows if there’s a creeper
trying to grind up on them on

the dance ﬂoor? (Speaking from V

experience, that’s a situation best
avoided.) Or, ifyou notice some-
one with whom you aren’t par-
ticularly friends hunched over
a toilet alone, would it take too
much out of you to get them back
to the Health Center? It is a safe
haven, and you don’t have to
spend the whole night watching
over someone.

These suggestions aren’t
meant to chide anyone into be-
ing a good Samaritan or to com-
promise the party experience,
but they are small steps toward
preventing statistics. If some-
one steps in before the frosh
girl blacks out, perhaps we can
prevent an incident of sexual as-
sault. If someone takes the boy
who’s projectile vomiting to the
health center, perhaps a preda-
tor’s plans could be foiled. Do
you see where I’m going with
this?

So, go forth and be merry. V

Party hard, but not too hard. Take
into consideration that you were
once a freshman, and some mis-
takes that you made could have

been prevented if only a guid-
ing hand had pointed you in the
right direction. Some mistakes
are funny stories, but other mis-
takes can signiﬁcantly impact a
person’s life in a negative way.
We are a small school: what goes
around comes around. Instead
of spreading mono, let’s spread
concern for one another’s well
being.

Hurley clearly has its short-

Hurley will never match mid-

First Year advice that wasn’t quite covered during O-Week

Stockton Bullitt outlines the true do 3 and don ’ts for the first year spent as an undergrad at Washington and Lee

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Now that we’re all a year
older, we’re going to have to get
used to the fact that we’re all
now in new grades.

Seniors, you have to start
coming to terms with the fact
that you have nine months until
your lives come down to 40lKs
and youth soccer games.

Juniors, you have to start
coming to terms with the older
version of bar mitzvah season:
21st birthdays.

And sophomores, you have
to start coming to terms with be-
ing irrelevant because you matter
about as much as Sasha Gray’s
acting career. I

Freshmen—oh sorry, ﬁrst-
years—you have quite a bit of
issues with which you need to
come to terms.

You’re in college now. It’s not
just any college, but a college
with a dead president in its back-
yard. Surviving this year will be
,an adventure, but it will be made
much easier if you follow a cou-
ple of guidelines.

Older people, you can feel
free to disagree with my advice
to the new kids, but freshmen,
trust me: I’m right.

So, without further ado, here’s

some advice for passing freshmen .

year at Washington and Lee.
1. You are the Master of the
Universe

See, you spent your last four
years in high school falsely as-
suming that you were at the cen-
ter of the universe. Luckily, now
that you have entered your fresh-
men year here, you’re actually
right.

All the other grades are go-
ing to court you, kiss your ass
and ﬁght for your attention in the
upcoming weeks. You are to the
Washington and Lee social scene
what Silly Bandz are to eight
year—olds.

2. Embrace being the center of
attention

Live up your freshmen fall as
best you can. Every day that you
don’t embrace your inner joie de
vivre is one more day that you
will regret later in your college
career.

This is the time to go on ad-
ventures. This is the year to
leave Windfall long after the sun
comes up. This is the year to go
camping deep in the woods for
days at a time. This is the year
to live out Vince’s current season
on “Entourage.”

You won’t have time to cel-
ebrate your college freedom the
older you get, and worse, you
won’t have three years of people
following your every move af-
ter this year. And in case you’re
wondering what your uniform
should be for these celebrations,
remember that when he was I8,
Jesus wore knee-high socks, a
lax penny and a backwards hat
from the town where he had a
summer house.

So regardless of who you
are and regardless of the extent
to which you do it, suck all the
air you can out of the whipped
cream can of freshmen year. That
being said...

3. Remember that you know
nothing

You heard me. My favorite
part of O-Week this year was sit-
ting back and listening to fresh-
men tell me what college is re-
ally like. .

Oh, you watched “Greek,” so
obviously you know what life
here is like. Gotcha. Nobody
likes a younger know-it-all, so
learn to shut your mouth.

I don’t care if a senior is tell-
ing you that Kevin Kolb is a le-'
gitimate NFL quarterback or that
Ron Paul will be president one
day; it’s not worth arguing about
it.

4. Assimilate into the culture
a little

I’m not saying that you need
to start calling it the War of
Northern Aggression but put a
little effort into ﬁnding ways to
identify with your surroundings.

Get a deﬁnitive opinion on
whether you are a Salemo’s or a
Frank’s person. Start listening to
some frat music: ifyou like good
music try listening to Chiddy
Bang, and if you like bad music
try listening to Sam Adams‘.

By no means does this mean
that you _ need to change your
personality, but now that you’re

you from the Walmart shelves.

populated with creatures in blue

5. Appease the shareholders

Even though they have shifted
from domestic tyrants to ﬁnan-

still need a little bit of love.

Give them a call occasionally,
especially when you’re running
low on funds. Think of yourself
as a politician and them as cam-

You will probably need at

may not be all they seem, and
heartbreak warfare is not really
fun to go through during rush.

The only real exception to this
is if you are Paul Rudd from “I
Love You, Man.” And even then
you’ll be forced to spend your
evenings watching “Chocolat.”

10. Spend this year taking in-
troductory classes

I know parents are going to
kill me for this one, but this is
really not the time to be taking
super-interesting, yet incredibly
demanding classes.

If you spent your high school
career killing yourself to get into
this college, which I’m assuming
most of you did, then you might
be a little bumt-out on academ-
ics.

Make this year about tak-
ing classes you need to take and
maybe trying a few new kinds
of classes. Save the fascinating
classes for a time when you are
once again fascinated by classes.

Now, if you spent your aca-

demic career chained down by
the intellectual incompetence of
your former peers and are dying
to ﬁnally spread your academic
wings, then completely disregard
this section, but when you have
to bite your tongue to stay awake
at your 8 a.m. 300-level class,
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Oh, and guys, it might be
a good idea to go easy on your
classes for the winter semester.
Just, um, a hint.

11. Never anger the Co-op

ladies

Purveyors of both wisdom and

sunrises, the Co-op ladies, along

with the crew in D-Hall,,hold the ‘

key to your stomach. Don’t mess
with them.

I have seen many overly ag— I

gressive students badger the la-
dies around midnight when free
food is occasionally given away

(this used to be a secret until se- "

crets stopped being possible at
W&L around 1789), and ‘their
lives have gone progressively
downhill.

Maybe it’s a buffalo bite or
two being taken away, maybe
it’s an extra 50 cents added onto
the cash tax, or maybe they will
just call another name when your
food is ready.

Regardless, these Venuses of
the commons are to be treated
with respect and admiration-
and who knows, maybe a sunrise
sandwich will ﬁnd its way into
your welcoming hands.

12. Listen to this article

This is one of the only places
you’ll hear sagely advice, like
that partying under the County
Seat porch is never a good idea.

_ Other little tidbits to note
are to avoid College ACB only
if you live on the fourth ﬂoor of
Graham-Lees and to make sure

you’re near a bathroom 10-15

minutes after eating at D-Hall.
You’ll thank me in due time.

Oh, and one last thing, to that
kid from Arizona who won the
trivia game at the beginning of
O-Week: don’t use it to try and
get laid. It doesn’t work. I know
from experience. Use this article
instead.

COLUMNIST

For those of you with good
memories, think back to the
ﬁrst time in your life when you
said something negative about
someone else.

One of your parents prob-
ably stepped in, chiding you to
“put yourself in the other per-
son’s shoes” before you rush to
judgment.

In this (Marlboro) light,
we’re going to take a look at
life through the eyes of one of
the country’s most persecuted

‘ minority groups: that of the
American smoker.

A hundred years ago, many
Americans disapproved of the
lifestyle of Irish immigrants.
Restaurants banned the Irish
with their unwelcoming “No
Irish Need Apply” signs, and
even the American government
supported harsh restrictions
aimed at controlling the Irish.

Substitute “smokers” for
“Irish” in the previous para-
graph, and it is obvious that we
have a minority group in need
of some love on our hands.
To quote the great bard Snoop
Dogg, “let’s take a journey” into
the life of the average American
smoker. You might think this is
just a “puff” piece, but hope-
fully it will give you something
to enjoy and read during class
as your ECON 101 professor
teaches you about inelastic de-
mand (assuming you’re laid-
back enough to appreciate the
irony).

Every day, you, the Washing-
ton and Lee smoker, feel alone,

unwanted, neglected. Your “real
friends” refuse to accompany
you as you shiver outside, alone
in the cold. Whenever you ap-
proach attractive women (or
even unattractive women for
that matter), they recoil in hor-
ror, as if you were brandishing
a burning stick on ﬁre or some-
thing. Elitist professors snort at
the habits you apparently share
with the Neanderthals, conde-
scendingly musing, “How hoi
polloi.” Even airline pilots taunt
you in your misery, leaving the
“No Smoking Sign” that lies
above your head fully lit right

once a week,” you feel unappre-
ciated. After all, if more Ameri-
cans were like you, there would
be no Social Security crisis.
Heck, there would be no Medi-
care crisis, and we’d probably
have a balanced budget.

Come on, you voluntarily
buy an item taxed at 300 percent
(every week no less) and this is
the thanks you get‘?

Even though what you’re do-
ing is perfectly legal, you’re re-
garded as an outcast. Your uncle,
Philip Morris, is such a pariah
that he is not even legally al-
lowed on television anymore. A

Come on, you voluntarily buy an item taxed at

3 00 percent (every week no less) and this is the

thanks you get?

next to the “Seatbelt Required”
sign, as if there is the slightest
chance that American Airlines
will let you light up midﬂight if
you play your cards right.

Worse, when you ﬁip through
the dozens of pages that denote
the minority groups protected
under your company’s “Equal
Opportunity Employer” code of
conduct, you notice that smok-
ers are conspicuously absent
from the list. After all, this is the
twenty-ﬁrst century. And you,
sir, are a social albatross.

Like a parents paying thou-
sands of dollars to send their son
to college who “only calls home

free market, indeed. A double
standard, you insist.

The FDA doesn’t mind giv-
ing pharmaceutical companies
TV time to air those drug com-
mercials that end with the mo-
notonous voice warning that
“side effects may include AIDS,
pregnancy or death (among oth-
er things)”, but heaven forbid we
ever see a gentleman churning a
Churchill. Oh well, life goes on
(err, maybe).

You wryly smirk when you
enter a bar or restaurant that
the (*cough*) liberals haven’t
slapped with a No-Smoking ban
yet. You rub your hands_ with

glee when you see that the bar
is divided into “Smoking” and
“Non-Smoking” sections, which
is kind oflike a pool roping itself
off into “Peeing” and “N0n-Pee-
ing” sections.

Instead of spending your night
chasing women, you choose to
sit next to the most obnoxious
person you can ﬁnd. It’s time to
“kill” two birds with one stone,
so to speak. You casually light
up your cigarette and take a nice,
slow puff, knowing full well that
your persecuted lifestyle choice,
much like Ted Kennedy’s driv-
ing, could potentially lead to the
death of those around you.

While everyone you meet
wishes that you would quit smok-
ing, you wish that you could go
back to a simpler time. I

A simpler time like the 1920s:
the good old days when smoking
was healthy. Back when it mat-
tered what brand four out of ﬁve
doctors endorsed (of course, even
back then, you had to watch out
for the “hatemongers” who went
as far as to argue that America’s
sweet ﬁery sensation “caused
cancer,” but I digress).

Obama must have made a
thousand» promises on the cam-
paign trail, but “quitting smok-
ing” is the only one he seems
to have kept, you note with a
twitch. For the third time in two
years, the Democrats are raising
taxes on cigarettes “to discour-
age consumption,” they claim.
On that note, you take a drag as
you‘ ponder what the purpose of
the “income tax” is.

! Locavo res feast

in Staunton r

Local food trend succeeds in surrounding areas and grows in popularity on W&L campus

By Marie.Locke
STAFF WRITER

The recent Locavore Fest,
held in Staunton, VA, celebrated
the use of locally grown foods.
The festival, which was hosted
by the Transition Organization,
was held on September 4.

The event featured a talk by
Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms,
“a family-owned, multi—gen-
erational, pasture-based, beyond
organic, local-market farm and
informational outreach in Vir-
ginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” ac-
cording to the farm’s website.

Several Staunton restaurants,
including Zydore, Staunton Gro-
cery and Mockingbird Artisan
Fare and Grill featured locavore
menus in honor of the event.

The evening highlighted a
growing trend towards the use
of local food in homes, restau-
rants, and here at Washington
and Lee. According to Assistant
Manager of the Marketplace
Kelly Brown, the push to use
local food on campus started
two years ago but has recently

Soco serenades frosh

gained momentum.

“We use a lot more [local]
product than we did in the begin-
ning,” Brown said. i

The initiative to cook with
local food came largely from
President Ruscio and several
student committees, accord-
ing to Brown. Currently, W&L
spends more than 12 percent of
its budget on products from over
50 local farms. W&L has also_
been awarded by the College
Sustainability Report Card with
an “A” grade for its food and re-
cycling program.

Special Projects Coordinator
Chris Carpenter has helped in
the quest for local food.

“Carpenter works with local
producers and inspects any new
vendors [dining services] uses,”
said Marketplace Chef Geral-
dine McCutcheon.

According to McCutcheon,
Carpenter is an experienced chef
and who is able to ﬁnd qual-
ity products while keeping cost

limitations in mind. He ensures
that the eggs are cage-free and
that the meat and dairy are free
of hormones and antibiotics.
The Marketplace menu is a

buys items that are already pur-
chased from another source.
Also, several of the products are
seasonal, like the local tomatoes
currently found in many reci-

blend of source- and menu-driv-
en lo.cal items. When Carpenter
ﬁnds new companies, he works
with Ms. McCutcheon to see if
she can develop a way to use the
product in Marketplace menus.

F irst-years get a taste of W&L tradition and culture

By Holly Suthers
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Orientation Week, affec-
tionately known to most as “O-
Week,” is a time where new stu-
dents are introduced to timeless
Washington and Lee traditions.
One of the most notable‘ and
loved events of all is the a Capel-
la concert at the Alumni Picnic at
the Liberty Hall Ruins.

This past Sunday evening,
choral groups JubiLee and
Southern Comfort provided an
entertaining and memorable ex-
perience for new and returning
students alike.

“I always enjoy the a capella
concerts. The songs are great and
the voices of all of the singers
are amazing,” said senior Mag-
gie Dozier.

W&L has four a capella
groups on campus: JubiLee,
Southern Comfort, General
Admission and Washingtones.

While the last two groups did not
perform at the picnic, they will
have several events throughout
the year.

Each group has unique char-
acteristics, but their high caliber
of performance is equal across
the board.

JubiLee, the all-girls group,
‘sang “Higher” with a solo by
senior Sarah Vinegar and “Ain’t
Too Proud to Beg,” with a solo
by junior Kaelin Fraley. JubiLee
is led by Emma Redd and held
auditions for new members this
past Sunday.

The infamous men’s group
Southern Comfort, or SoCo,
performed a rousing rendition
of “Kiss the Girl,” in which the
men invited two freshmen to par-
ticipate and even kiss. The group
also held auditions this past Sun-
day and is led by senior Clark

Simcoe.

“SoCo has been one of the
most memorable experiences for
me at W&L,” said senior Graham
Perkins. “I will always remember
Malcolm Hines and Thomas Sell-
ers’ entertaining faces and voices
during every performance.”

A capella performances take
place several times throughout
the year. The most popular events
are held on Parents Weekend and
during the holiday season. Ticket
information is available from the
Box Ofﬁce at the Lenfest Center
and remember to reserve tickets
in advance.

pes. Carpenter and McCutcheon
work closely together to ensure
that the products are of the high-
est quality. The Chef also re-
quests for Carpenter to ﬁnd spe-
ciﬁc products that she has seen
at the local markets in the area.
Students and faculty eating at
the Marketplace should look for
the many locally sourced menu

items, which are often fresher
and healthier than other prod-
ucts. Lexington farmer Charlie
Potter supplies all the burgers
and ground beef in the Market-
place. The chicken is local from
Sunrise Farms, and producer
Steve Baker supplies breakfast
sausage.

The Marketplace also fea-

tures cheeses and yogurts from’

Mountain View Farms, one
of the most popular being the
“Moogurt.” The honey is bought
from Whistle Creek Apiary, and
grits and whole-wheat ﬂour come
from Wade’s Mill. Even the tofu
is made locally by Twin Oaks,
which uses soybeans grown in
Virginia.

One ofthe most popular items
is milk supplied by Homestead
Dairy, located in Burt Chimney.
This milk is fresh, additive free
and has more solids in it than
the commercially produced milk
found in grocery stores.

W&L has plans to expand

its reliance on local products. In
part, the focus is on responding
to the changing tastes of each
class and expanding the array of
healthy Options. For example,
pizza is now made with a whole-
wheat crust and whole-grain-
pastas and brown rice have been
added to the menu. Other addi-
tions include sweet potato fries,
a variety of breakfast choices
and baked goods.

 

Lyrics every W&L student should know....
The Washington and Lee Swing

Come cheer for Washington and Lee,

We're going to win another victory!

The White and Blue we will ever wave in triumph
For the University. RAH! RAH! RAH!

Fight to the ﬁnish we are with you,

Break through the line on every play;

Rush the ball on down the ﬁeld
And we will win thisgame today.

When Washington and Lee's men fall in line,
We're going to win again another time;

For W&L I yell, I yell, I yell,
And for the University, I yell, like hell!

And we will ﬁght! ﬁght! ﬁght! for every yard;
Circle the ends and hit that line right hard!
And we will roll those Wahoos on the sod!
Yes, by God! RAH! RAH! RAH!

HEY!

its season opener in a 3-0 loss. The Gen-
erals, picked to be No. 2 in the ODAC
conference in a preseason vote by league
coaches, managed to hold off the Cardi-
nals for the ﬁrst half but three second-

games under their belt and they’re a very
athletic team, so I think it was a good
learning experience for everyone to take
us forward into the next couple games.”

Senior midﬁelder Tory Gagliardi

 

scored the ﬁrst goal for Catholic on an
unassisted toss. Junior forward Tracey
Scanlon brought the Cardinals’ lead
to 2-0 with another netter. Senior mid-
ﬁelder Caroline Reilly struck the W&L
goal again for the Cardinals with a shot
off a penalty corner and an assist from
defender Catherine Mirsky. The Gener-
als, meanwhile, struggled to get their of-
fense offthe ground.‘ ’ .

“I think our passing and receiving
could have been better... just looking as
a team up the ﬁeld to get some offense
going,” said junior offensive player
Christina Benedetti. “We had no offense
whatsoevef....The good part about it is
all ofthat is so ﬁxable. We can do drills
to work on passing and receiving. We
can do things to work on defense.”

The opening loss comes on the heels
of a largely successful 2009 season. The
Generals closed out the year with a loss
in the ODAC semifinals to‘ Eastern Men-
nonite University. The team ﬁnished l0-
7 overall and 5-2 in the ODAC confer-
ence.

The Generals lost their leading scorer
Sallie Armstrong, who graduated, and
her absence will be felt on the offensive
side ofthe ﬁeld, saidjunior forward Em-
ily Kunkel.

“She deﬁnitely had the momentum

that we could have used in the game,”
she said. “But we bumped Kelly Tran
[senior] up to forward and that really
helped us a lot.”

The team returns several other key
players, including sophomore forward
Katharine Price who notched ﬁve goals

last season, and team captains Emmy
Mathews and Kate Donnelly.

The Generals’ next game is set for
Tuesday at Frostburg State University.
Game time is at 6 p.m.

Volleyball takes first in W&L Invite

The Generals went 3 -I over the weekend and dropped only three sets to claim victory in their opening tournament

By Rosie Purdy
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee volleyball
team had a triumphant beginning to its
2010 season this weekend, defeating
three out of four teams to win the W&L
Invitational for the seventh time.

Senior defensive specialist and cap-
tain Summer Goldberg said she is proud
of the team’s early victory.

“One of our biggest goals from pre-
season was to win a tournament,” said
Goldberg. “So it was really nice to ac-
complish that so early in the season.”

. The Generals success in the tourna-
ment began with a 3-0 sweep against
McDaniel College.

First-year outside hitter M.A. Boles
and junior middle hitter Lindsey Dee
aided in the win, totaling 14 kills and six
digs, and nine kills and eight blocks, re-
spectively. Senior middle blocker Lou-

ise Brooks also contributed, with ﬁve
kills, ﬁve blocks and four digs.

F irst-year setter Meghan Meleski
totaled 22 assists and four service aces,
while sophomore libero Cameron Hill
chipped in 17 digs.

W&L struggled in its next match-
up, falling 3-2 to Averett University.
After battling Averett through four sets
and forcing the game into a ﬁfth set, the
Generals were ultimately defeated 15-9
in the ﬁnal set.

Leading the Generals’ offense for the
match was junior outside hitter Megan
Daily, who added 17 kills, while Boles
contributed 16 kills.

Meleski helped the Generals rally
with 35 assists and 13 digs. Hill totaled
20 digs, and Goldberg added 10 digs and
three service aces.

Goldberg said that unforced errors
were a big part of the team’s loss, but
she wasn’t completely disappointed in
the outcome.

“We made a lot of mistakes that al-
lowed [Averett] to rack up a ton of
points,” Goldberg said. “But the game
showed that we could battle back, even
when we were down. We weren’t just
going to give up.”

The team rebounded from Friday’s
loss with a 3-0 victory over Southern
Virginia University on Saturday mom-
ing. W&L won an easy ﬁrst ‘set with
a score of 25-10. Tensions were high
during the second set of the match, as
the SVU Knights stole the lead several
times, but the Generals held them off
and triumphed 35-33. A 25-10 beating
in the third set secured W&L the win.

Highlights of the match included
nine digs apiece for Dec and Boles, six
kills from Daily and four kills each from
sophomore right side Bailey Walker and
ﬁrst-year outside hitter Allison Rouse.

The invitational wrapped up with a
3-0 sweep for W&L against Transylva-
nia University in the ﬁnal and touma-
ment-deciding match. Boles led the of-
fense with ll kills, ﬁve digs and three
service aces. Hill added 16 digs, while
senior defensive specialist Jenna Finger
chipped in eight digs and three "service
aces.

With a three-way record tie between
W&L, Transylvania and Averett, the
win went to the Generals, who lost only
three sets throughout the tournament,
compared to Transylvania’s four and
Averett’s ﬁve.

Boles’ weekend record of 50 kills, 40
digs, and 13 service aces earned her the
title of tournament MVP. She was also
named to the invitational’s All-Touma-
ment team, along with Dee and Meles-
ki.

Senior defensive specialist Marah
Schmitz said the ﬁrst-year players such
as Boles will play a big part in the team’s
success this season.

“It doesn’t usually happen that
so many.of our freshmen are on the
court with so much playing time,” said
Schmitz. “We have a very strong group
of freshmen this season.”

The Generals will ﬁght for another
win when they play Guilford on Tues-
day night.

Women’s soccer breaks even in invite

The Generals dropped their ﬁrst game, 1-0, to Sewanee, but defeated Methodist University, 1-0, to start season I -I

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Back-to-back home games for this
weekend’s Washington and Lee Invi-
tational gave the women’s soccer team
a 1-1 start to the season. The Generals
stumbled to a 1-0 loss versus Sewanee
on Saturday, but rebounded with a 1-0

win over Methodist University on Sun-
day.

It’s “kind of a mixed reaction,” said
senior midﬁelder Taylor Garrett. “The

team played really well. There were a lot
of positive things coming out ofit. .. but
at the same time we had a lot oftrouble
putting the ball in the back ofthe net.”
Facing off against Sewanee, the Gen-
erals were able to hold off the Tigers for

much of the game. But Sewanee defend-
er Lilly Barnett used an assist from mid-
ﬁelder Bess Goodman to break the 0-0
tie and earn the win for the University

of the South.

The loss marked a sluggish start for
the Generals, who last year claimed the
ODAC Conference Championship and
earned a bid to the NCAA Division III

women’s soccer tournament. A second- .

Saturday’s game

The Generals are hoping for similar re-
sults this year.

“Going into every season our goal
is to win ODACS [and] make it into the
NCAAS, and so that’s what we’re look-
ing toward,” Garrett said. “We started
with a loss which is unfortunate, but
we’re looking to keep winning...We’re
expecting to do really well this year.”

A late-game goal from Garrett put the
Generals right back in winning form in
their second weekend match-up against
Methodist University.

Scoring the ﬁrst team goal of the sea-
son “was really exciting [and] not an ex-
perience I’ve had before,” said Garrett.

The Generals outshot the Monarchs

I5-l and took the lead in comer kicks as
well at 14-2.

Returning goaliejunior Emily Leary,
held strong in the goal for the Generals
for the entire game and recorded her
ﬁrst shutout of the season. Leary put up
a conference-leading 13 shutouts last
year. Her 0.54 goals-against average in
22 appearances meanwhile was good
enough for second in the conference and
20th in the nation.

The Generals will play Guilford Col-
lege on Saturday.

A pack of W&L women runners hit their stride during Saturday’s W&L Invite. The women’s team finished

first place overall.

Generals dominate W&L Invite  

Women ﬁnish ﬁrst and men ﬁnish Second in Season opener,

By Brooke Sutherland

The Washington and Lee cross coun-
try teams opened the 2010 season with
top place ﬁnishes on their own turf. The
women’s team placed ﬁrst, and the men’s
team earned a second-place ﬁnish in the
W&L Invitational on Saturday.

 

Runners flash by during the men’s race at the Dick Miller Cross country

Course on Saturday morning.

On the women’s side, W&L sophomore
Lauren Schultz led the pack with an indi-
vidual ﬁrst-place ﬁnish at a time of 24: l 8.
Schultz comes into the season crowned
with ODAC laurels. Following her ﬁrst-
year showing last season, she took home
the title of ODAC Rookie of the Year and
earned All-ODAC honors.

New team additions also made their
mark on the course with three Top 15 ﬁn-
ishes. First-year Annelise Madison took
eighth with a time of 25:43 and Bella
Zuroski was close behind in llth place
with a time of 26:02. Fellow ﬁrst year
Ashley Gerard placed l3th with a time of
26:14.

“We have nine freshmen, which is the
most we’ve ever had since l’ve been at
W&L, and they all are really great,” said
senior captain Katherine Fenwick. “Each
one brings so much to the team.”

Fenwick, who returns for her fourth
season, took ﬁfth place with a time of
25:16. One of Fenwick’s goal for this sea-
son is to win the ODAC championship and
with this strong opening invite, the team is
already off to a great start.

“We’ve been training really hard for
the past few weeks, and we came out and
worked together really well,” F enwick
said. “And obviously it worked because
we won.”

Junior Matt Gossett gave the Generals
the top spot on the men’s side, earning ﬁrst
place honors with a time of28:56. Gossett
ﬁnished 22 in last year’s ODAC Champi-
onship race. He was joined in the top six

by sophomore returner Tyler Gehrs, who ,

took ﬁfth with a time of 29:21, and new-
comer Kane Thomas, who took sixth with
a time of29:24.

“There weren’t a ton of teams there,
but we were pretty happy with how we
ran,” Gossett said. “We lost our top two
guys from last year, but we still had three
guys in the top six.”

The Generals’ effort fell just short of
a top ﬁnish and Roanoke College went

home with the top prize. The Generals will
race again this Saturday in the Dickinson
Invitational in Pennsylvania. The men
start at 10:30 a.m. and the women run at
l2: l 5 p.m. '
