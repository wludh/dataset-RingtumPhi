Phinding the
phishers  

W&L ’s ITS staﬂ gives tips on

how to avoid e-mail scams

By Victoria Taylor
STAFF WRITER

When you get an e-mail urging you to send in
your password or other personal information in order
to keep your account from becoming invalidated, do
you do it? , ’

Absolutely not, said Jeff Overholtzer, the Direc-
tor of Strategic Planning and Communication for
the university’s Information Technology Services
department. ITS and legitimate organizations will
never ask for your password.

These e-mails represent typical “phishing” at-
tempts. Forget the bait and tackle; this kind of phish-
ing is thedeceitful process of attempting to gather
crucial information (such as usernames, passwords
and credit card numbers) through e-‘mails masquer-
ading as valid messages. And these attempts tend to
swell at the beginning of the academic year.

So what are the consequences of taking the bait?
According to Overholtzer, each threat has to be ex-
amined individually. When a user gives his pass-
word, the phisher can use it to take over his account
and in turn use that to send out more spam messages.
This could yield disastrous results. If a company like
Google or Yahoo, or another university starts to re-
ceive dangerous e-mails from a “wlu” account, they
could blacklist the university, thus putting up a bar-

ricade against all messages from Washington and -

Lee.

ITS and the other departments have put I25 hours
into‘ troubleshooting problems caused by phishing
since Jan. I, Overholtzer said. Last year, Overholtzer
said between 5 and 10 students reported falling vic-
tim to phishing attempts. Post-phish attack clean-up
can involve locking the student’s account and isolat-
ing the machine from the network. In other words, it
is a major inconvenience.

There is also the problem of identity theft. A suc— I

cessful phisher can access any person’s information
stored in an e-mail account, like the user’s social
security number and mother’s maiden name. Once
a user gives the phisher his password, the phisher
might be able to subsequently hack into the same
individual’s Facebook account and make use of all
of the information stored there.

Overholtzer said the university has surveillance
tools at multiple levels, antivirus software on all of
the campus desktops and more e-mail-speciﬁc soft-
ware and spam ﬁlters to protect users against phish-
ing attempts. The software has been intercepting
an estimated 800,000 phishing attempts a week for
faculty and _staff accounts, he said. Overholtzer es-
timates that the number is comparable or greater for
student accounts.

Education about phishing and other security is-
sues is key to preventing problems.

“Anyone who asks you to disclose information in
an e—mail is probably fraudulent,” Overholtzer said.

Phishing can get technical, so ITS has chosen to
use metaphors to make the message hit home for
students. Among their campaigns was as series of
posters that showed a few garden hoses and a snake,
asking the viewer to “ﬁnd the phish.”

Misspelled words, run-on sentences and improp-

er grammar are red ﬂags (or, in this case, the snakes I

among the garden hoses) to look for in that e-mail
asking for you to verify your account. Also, be leery
of threats that are too good to be true, like money of-
fers and messages urging you to act quickly. Check-
ing the e-mail address of the original sender can also
be helpful, as many phish attempts come from non-
edu addresses.

Overholtzer urged anyone who has questions re-
garding an e-mai|’s authenticity to ask ITS before
responding.

“No one should be embarrassed about asking ‘is
this real?’” he said. Even ITS staff members “have
had to look quite closely before we could decide.”

Kappa Sigma fraternity begins its much-anticipated recolonization on W&L is campus

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The excitement and hope that the
Kappa Sigma national organization
and the school administration had
for Kappa Sigma at the close of the
2009-2010 school year has contin-
ued into the new recruitment season.

In an interview last year, Mic
Wilson, Executive Director of Kap-
pa Sigma, was conﬁdent that the fra-
ternity’s history and opportunity for
student leadership would attract new
members. Clay Coleman, Director
of Student Activities and Greek Life,
said he also thought that the frater-
nity would have a successful recruit-
ment.

Now that the new school year and
the new recruitment season have be-
gun, Coleman, and other members of
Kappa Sigma’s ‘national organization
and alumni are still optimistic about
successfully restoring the third old-
est chapter of Kappa Sigma at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Kappa Sigma’s recruitment pro-
cess will be facilitated by Trey Weit-
zel, Area 1 Recruitment Manager,
who is also managing over 60 other
chapters located between Canada
and North Carolina. Weitzel was one
of the founders of the Omicron Phi
chapter at Washington College in
2007.

Weiztel is mainly targeting ﬁrst-
year men since “there are not a lot of
guys interested in Greek life that are
not already in a fraternity,” he said.

Weitzel said that Facebook ad-
vertisements have already generated
some interest, and reported a “pretty
good” showing at the open-house
events. However, he expects the
number of people to ebb and wane.

“You might take two steps for-
ward and half a step back, but that’s
how it works... Slowly, one guy a
time, we’ll work toward our goal of

30 to 35 guys,” he said.

In addition to hosting open-house
events, Weiztel is trying to appeal to
ﬁrst-year men through the women on
this campus. He has delivered plat-
ters of cookies to each of the sorority
houses, and is planning to invite one
sorority to each of his open-house
events.

Last week, he invited the women
ofAlpha Delta Pi to the cookout and
open house. He said that because
ADPi recently colonized, he thought
they would be on the same wave-
length as Kappa Sigma. '

“I always like to build relation-
ships with the sororities because
they can be an asset. It’s always nice
to have ladies at the events,” said
Weitzel, who believes that women
have bearing on the decisions poten-
tial new members make in choosing’
a fraternity.

The event was also attended by
brothers "from the Lambda-Sigma
chapter at James Madison Univer-
sity, and the Nu-Sigma chapter at
Radford University.

Chaz Trant, a senior brother of
the chapter at J MU, was present at
the event to help Weitzel with the re-
cruitment event.

“I know how hard it is to recruit. I
was recruitment chair, and we really
wanted to help create a good atmo-
sphere for an event like this. It’s hard
to do it by yourself, so we wanted
to lend a hand,” said Trant, whose

grandfather was a member of Kappa

Sigma.

One of Weitzel’s tactics of re-
cruiting new members is to instill
a sense of the fraternity’s and the
W&L chapter’s rich history.

“This history is only so relevant
to people who aren’t in Kappa Sig-
ma, so I tell the guys: there are over

1,000 members of Kappa Sigma
who have been initiated through this
chapter, and there are a lot of alumni
that want this chapter to come back,”
Weitzel said. “You have an oppor-
tunity here, if you’re interested in
Greek life and you want an opportu-
nity to shape itjust the way you want
it to be. It’s an opportunity to leave a
legacy at W&L.”

The alumni of Kappa Sigma are
also supportive ofthe re-colonization
process. Trey Hart, who was a Kappa
Sigma brother at W&L from 2003 to
2006, believes that Kappa Sigma has
a lot to offer its new members.

“The new Kappa Sigma chapter
provides for a unique and exciting
opportunity for both upperclassmen
and freshmen to form their own start-
up fraternity that will form an iden-
tity all its own on campus. Kappa
Sigma has long held a storied place
in fraternity history at W&L and the
re—established chapter will have the
full support ofits alumni,” said Hart,
who is planning to help re-establish
the chapter.

Clay Coleman, Director of Stu-
dent Activities and Greek Life,
though hopeful, does not believe that
much of the recruiting success will
come from upperclass students.

“I’m thinking realistically, I don’t
think they will have much luck with
sophomores, and by that I mean,
I don’t think they’re going to get a
pledge class of 5, and I’ve shared
that with them,” said Coleman, who
believes that Kappa Sigma will have
its biggest success with ‘ﬁrst-year
studentsrather than upperclassmen.

However,‘ some _of the ﬁrst-year
students that are targeted do not
seem to be as excited as those who
are working behind the scenes of the
recruitment process. Some ﬁrst-year

men argue that re-colonizing the
chapter will be too time-consuming
while others give different reasons
for shrugging off the fraternity.
First-year students Timothy
Moore and Matt Ziemer said they
are not seriously considering Kappa

‘Sigma because the dynamics of the

fraternity are unclear since there are
not any existing members.

“I would only do it ifl knew a big
group of my friends were doing it
too,” said Ziemer.

Despite the opinions of the ﬁrst
years, both Coleman and Weitzel
believe that there is a place on the
W&L campus and in the Greek com-
munity for Kappa Sigma. '

“The student body is staying 80
percent Greek because we have or-
ganizations that aren’t all the same. I
think that people can ﬁnd a niche in
a home at Kappa Sigma, speciﬁcally
those who really want a challeng-
ing experience at developing their
leadership skills rather than solely
engage in the social environment,”
said Coleman.

Weitzel said that the fraternity is
looking for men who will uphold the
four pillars of Fellowship, Leader-
ship, Scholarship, and Service, as
well as respect their ideals as mem-
bers. He adds that the future brothers
of Kappa Sigma will be an asset to
the W&L community.

“We are coming on campus to ac-
tively participate in the Greek com-
munity, and we want to enhance what
is already here. Even with 15 other
fraternities, one more isjust going to
make it better,” said Weitzel.

The CIA comes a-calling at W&L

An upcoming information session will expose students to potential careers in the Central Intelligence/Ignecy

By Teresa Soley
STAFF WRITER

A Central Intelligence Agen-
cy recruiter will be visiting
Washington and Lee as a guest
of Career Services next Tuesday,
September 21.

Steven Peyton, Mid-Atlantic
Recruiter for the CIA, willbe
holding an information session
open to students of all years and
majors. Peyton will address top-
ics such as obtaining security
clearance, career opportunities
and student internships.

The CIA’s core values of
“Service, Integrity, and Excel-
lence” coincide with the values
embodied by W&L’s Honor Sys-
tem. Paired with W&L’s strong
academic tradition and involved

Wonderful widening W&L wireless  

student body, W&L students are
additionally appealing to recruit-
ers. W&L is a highly respected
institution and is ranked amoung
US News and World Report’s top
colleges, garnering the attention
of employers such as the CIA.

The CIA recruits from a di-
verse pool of both large and
small schools, but speciﬁcally
focuses on the Mid-Atlantic re-
gion (including Virginia) since
students from this geographic
area are most likely to be open
to relocation to the Washington

' D.C. area.

Liz Shupe, Associate Director
of Career Services, said she en-
courages “all students who might

be interested in learning about
full—time jobs and internships” to
come to the information session,
adding that students of “all ma-
jors, all class years are invited.”
In addition to the open infor-
mation session, the recruiter will
be‘ giving students the opportu-
nity to meet with him in a one-
on-one setting, in which he will
review and critique students’ re-
sumes and discuss future careers
with the CIA or other federal
government positions. Employ-
ment opportunities range from
clandestine service positions to
analytical positions to linguistics,
with opportunities in the scien-
tiﬁc and technological ﬁelds also

available. The CIA also offers
competitive student internship
programs. The application dead-
line for summer 2011 student
employment is October 15, and
requirements for application can
be found on the CIA website.
Kimberly Cole of Career
Services explains that “CIA
recruiting begins early in the
school year because of the time
it takes to earn a security clear-
ance, which is 9 to 12 months.”
The recruiter will explain this
process, as well as the different
career paths available within the
‘agency, during his information
session.
The CIA, and the federal gov-

ernment in general, typically hires
students of all majors and back-
grounds; however, “students with
international travel experience,
foreign language skills, and ex-
ceptional writing skills have the
best chance of being hired,” Cole
said. Recruiters are also seeking
students with “well-rounded pro-
ﬁles” who have strong academic
records and who are involved in
“extra-curricular activities such
as athletics and community ser-
vice,” according to Cole.
Careers in the CIA are not “as
seen on TV,” and recruiters seek
to dispel common myths about
professions in the agency when
visiting college campuses. “Re-

cruiters want to educate students

_ on the realities of working for the
agency,” said Ms. Cole, and this '

will certainly be the core of the
recruiter’s information session
this Tuesday. The information
session will be held in Huntley
Hall room 235 at 5 p.m., and ap-
pointments for individual meet-
ings may be scheduled by phone
or in person through the Career
Services ofﬁce.

Summer improvements make W&L wirless service faster and more powerful, despite early diﬁiculties

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Over the summer, Washing-
ton and Lee’s wireless Internet
service doubled in capacity, but
this improvement was not with-
out growing pains. Information
and Technology Services have
been hard at work ﬁxing issues in
the new system so that students

. can enjoy fast, glitch-free service
as classes get underway.

W&L’s Internet ‘connection
has jumped from 100 megabits
per second last year to 200 Mbps
this year. ITS has upgraded the
system to the “N” broadcast stan-
dard, the most advanced standard
available, allowing increased
speed, range and security.

But most transitions are a
little bumpy, and this one is no
exception. Erratic service has
plagued both Mac computers and
students in all ﬁrst-year dorms.

For Mac users, losses of con-
nectivity commonly occuired
when moving the computer on-
campus from an off-campus
location and after the computer

came out of sleep mode.

Mike Courtney, network en-
gineer for ITS, has been work-
ing with W&L’s service provider
ARUBA to address the problem
and they implemented a ﬁx this
past Wednesday.

“We think this has resolved
the issue,” said Courtney.

According to surveys on stu-
dent computer use, the number of
Mac users has increased steadily
every year, and Jeff Overholtzer,
director of strategicrplanning and
communications, believes the
number of Mac users now equals
the number of Windows users.
He encourages any Mac users
still experiencing problems with
connectivity to contact ITS with
details oftheir problem.

With regard to those students
having problems in the freshmen
dorms, Overholtzer said, “wired
technology is still better than the
best wireless technology.” He
cited the Ethernet jacks in each
dorm room as a fast, consistent

alternative to the wireless net-
work. _

. Besides these temporary is-
sues, the entire system overhaul
has been a signiﬁcant improve-
ment. Access now extends out
to every athletic ﬁeld, allowing
play-by-play coverage of sport-

Facebook, to 20 mbps out of the
available 100 mbps. Now, us-
ing a new tool called a “packet
shaper,” ITS has conﬁned the
restriction to business hours
only, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and
increased the allotted bandwidth
to 80 mbps. At all other times

“We are among the most advanced when com-

pared to peer schools in terms of speed, breadth

of coverage and secure access. ”

JEFF OVERHOLTZER, director ofstrategic planning

ing events onthe athletics web-
site. Recreational use of the In-
ternet, which Courtney deﬁnes
as “anything that’s fun,” has also
been allowed greater bandwidth
access.

Last year’s policy applied a
24/7 restriction of recreational
use, such as Youtube, Hulu and

during weekdays and all day on
weekends, recreational use is al-
lowed the full 200 mbps. Court-
ney even mentioned a possible
loosening of restrictions dur-
ing March Madness, when web
streaming is at its absolute peak.

In addition to the increased
speed and range of the new sys-

tem, the security is now airtight.
All data sent through the network
is encrypted to protect private in-
formation.

Along with the improvements
to W&L’s system, Rockbridge
County will soon get a network
upgrade of its own. As part of the
stimulus package program, the
Rockbridge Area Network Au-
thority won $7 million to build
a new data center to beneﬁt the
community. W&L will match
this grant up to $2.5 million and
the county is contributing anoth-
er $0.5 million.

The new data center, which
may be located on campus as
soon as 2012, would provide
faster Internet connection to ma-
jor utilities, ﬁre stations, police
stations, schools, hospitals and
local businesses.

According to a White House
press release, “studies link avail-
ability of broadband Internet ac-
cess to economic vitality.” Rural

Better off dead than co-ecl at W&L

Washington and Lee is problem with diversity is now starting to resemble its problem with gender 25 years ago

By Michele Farquaharson
co LU M NIST

One ﬁne day in Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, a senior woman
at UVA met a ﬁrst-year law
student who just graduated from
the esteemed Washington and
Lee. Upon their meeting she
noticed the bumper sticker on
the cooler he is carrying, which
reads: “W&L, Better off Dead
than Co-Ed.” Now, being the
calm, cool, sophisticated woman
that she is, she proceeds to stick
her ﬁnger in the man’s face and
berate him with how much of
an old-fashioned, fascist, low-
down, no-good, son of a. .. well
you get the idea. She ﬁnished
with this comment: “Just wait:
one ofthese days you’re going
to have a daughter, and all she’s
going to want to do is go to your
school and you are going to be
thrilled!”

Little did they know how
true that statement was, because
hey, here I am, about to gradu-
ate from W&L and let me tell
you, things have changed since
my dad graduated in 1985. Not

to give anybody the wrong
idea about my dad’s opinions
of co-ed education—he could
not be happier with my deci-
sion to' attend his alma mater,
and believes the addition of
women have boosted the qual-
ity of education at W&L as well
as increased its competitive-
ness with other elite liberal arts
institutions. So my question

is, ifa change as big as adding
women to W&L can occur with
such positive effects, why is it
that the biggest criticism of our
school is its lack of diversity?
Why does W&L seem to be
afraid of change? ’

I believe one of the reasons
is the strength of tradition on
campus. As the Class of 20l4_
has heard over and over again
for the past two weeks, W&L
is all about history and tradi-
tion. From the honor code and
the speaking tradition to leav-
ing Traveller’s door open and
not walking through the center
of the main entrance-way of

Graham-Lees, the history of
this place cannot help but in-
fect those on campus to fall in
line with the traditions of the
past. And as I hope most of you

statistics surpass those of cam-
puses twice our size and half our
caliber? How can you change a
place like W&L without losing
the traditions that made us all

“So why is it that we struggle with diversity;

that despite our honor system and behavioral

expectations, our sexual assault statistics sur-

pass those of campuses twice our size and half

our caliber? How can you change a place like
W&L without losing the traditions that made us

all apply?”

would agree that the education
you receive from W&L is truly
one of the ﬁnest.

So why is it that we struggle
with diversity; that despite our
honor system and behavioral
expectations, our sexual assault

apply?

In pursuit of these changes
I look to the steps that were
taken over twenty years ago
when W&L decided to admit
women. An honest discussion
was had throughout all walks of

life on campus addressing what
changes;would need to be made
in order to meet the desired goal
of admitting women.

At the time of these discus-
sions, my dad was a senior and
president of his fraternity. One
of the big concerns was the tra-
dition of Greek life on campus,
and what effects adding women
would have. The fraternity
presidents agreed that for Greek
life to continue on campus the
University would have to make
a conscious effort to bring in a
strong sorority system to create
equal opportunities for women
to participate in Greek life.
While fraternities outnumber so-
rorities on campus two-to-one,
these efforts resulted in sorority
row and six strong chapters of
Greek women, who contribute
daily to W&L’s tradition of
Greek life.

I’m not saying these changes

" were immediate, or that there

was not signiﬁcant trial and er-
ror, but they were made, and

they were successful in enrich-
ing and diversifying the W&L
community while also uphold-
ing the traditions of the school.

In looking to the future of
W&L and the changes I believe
need to be made in diversifying
the culture on campus, I hope
those involved remember to
have the necessary, if difficult,
discussions that preserve the
essential traditions that deﬁne
Washington & Lee while im-
proving upon this great place I
call home.

his soul. The product I’m talk-
ing about would be located in
the shower and used during a
shower.

Nair for Men would be a fan-
tastic smelling lotion one could
rub on their face and wash off,
resulting in a perfectly clean-
shaven face. Aside from apply-
ing an extremely acidic mixture
to your face, it sounds like a
great idea, right? Wrong.

Gotcha.

Now, since I have your at-
tention, let me get to my main
point. By the way, that little
introduction gimmick was the
dumbest shit that I have writ-
ten... excluding a certain prob-

lem I had back in elementary
school that somewhere around
15 percent of all boys go
through. It’s not a big deal (“Su-
perbad” reference, for anyone
who is totally lost). Now for my
main point: I’m talking about
Major League Baseball here,
people.

This is the time of year when
people like me get really pissed
off. The NFL season has started
and Major League Baseball has
once again taken a back seat. I
usually just deal with it, have a
four loco and blend in. But this

is the ﬁnal straw.

' Everyone needs to watch
MLB baseball right now. The
race for the playoffs is in full
stride, and what’s happening
around the league this season
is truly unbelievable. Just two
weeks ago, the Phillies took
the lead in the National League
East for the ﬁrst time since May.
After leading the NL West the
entire season, the San Francisco
Giants now have a half-game
lead over the San Diego Padres,
whose home city is named for a
whale’s vagina. Not to mention

Everyone needs to watch MLB baseball right

and whats happening around the league this

back from

the best
changeup
in baseball.
Oh, and
he’s 3-1

in his last K

four starts

with 32

strikeouts

during that span.

Now, the main event of base-
ball: THE New York Yankees.
You may think that I’m just
some arrogant Yankees fan, and
you would without a doubt be
correct. People hate me for my
undying love of the Yankees,
and I love it.

The race for the American
League East crown between
the Tampa Bay Rays and the

  
  

Yankees is one of the best to
date. Rarely does it happen in
baseball when the clear two best
teams are in the same division.
The Rays travel to New York
for a four-game series tonight
at 7:05. When you watch this
matchup, realize that you are
watching the consummate base-
ball game.

OK, now that I got the mes- .
sage across, I feel a bit better
and want to tell ajoke. ‘

opinions

 

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS snrron

As a liberal at Washington
and Lee, I am ashamed to say
that it took me this long to start
reading “Game Change.”

As a liberal, reading John
Heilemann and Mark Halperin’s
detailed account of the 2008
election, released this past Jan-
uary, is like watching a sport’s
team championship DVD. Ev-

tastic campaign and had lots of
ingenuity and blah, blah, blah.
Ultimately, most American vot-
ers in 2008 were dissatisﬁed
with Bush and consequently
picked the polar opposite for

their next president. End of

story.
That led me to think (actu-
ally, needing an article topic

However, just because people of authority

on subjects profess to know a complicated

solution to a problem, it doesn ’t mean that

an easier answer isn ’t a better one.

 

ery paragraph reads like a giant
pat on the back to Obama, and
I couldn’t be happier to accept
the compliments.

Reading about McCain’s
handling of the ﬁrst debate
with Obama made me feel like
a Red Sox fan going to You-
Tube to see the Dave Robert’s
steal one more time; uncover-
ing Clinton’s strategy for Iowa
made me feel like a Saints fan
watching Manning’s face as he
threw to Tracy Porter in Super
Bowl XLIV.

Okay, enough sports analo-
gies. Once you get past the
championship highlights of
Obama’s campaign, the book
left me with one major conclu-
sion: Obama was going to win
from day one.

All 464 pages really can
be boiled down to “2008 was
a change election and Barack
Obama represented the most
change.”

It really could not be more
simple. Yes, Obama ran a fan-

24 hours before the deadline
led me to think) that there are
plenty other major stories and
problems in the world that are
made to seem much more com-
plicated than they really are.

‘ Crazy, right?

Okay, there are certainly
times when the simplest answer
or solution is not the right one.

Figuring out health care?
I don’t care where you stand
on the topic, health care is
one freaking complex solution
whatever you choose.

Registering for classes?
There is deﬁnitely no easy so-
lution to. get everyone into the
class they want.

Diagramming the various
friendship and relationship his-
tories of “Jersey Shore?” Deﬁ-
nitely complex. I don’t think
we’ve invented an algorithm to
solve that puppy yet.

Still, there are a couple of
times when the simple solution
is right.

Unfortunately, you probably

won’t ever ﬁnd out what that is
that simple solution. Making a
problem seem complex implies
that there are only a set amount
of people who can understand
the solution.

Therefore, it is advantageous
for whoever istelling you about
the problem—your friends,
newscasters, politicians—to
complicate the situation so they
can provide you with the exclu-
sive, complex answer.

By giving you an easy and
clear answer, these purveyors
of information would give up
their legitimizing power of ex-
clusive knowledge .

For example, who "would
pay an art professor to give lec-
tures on how to just throw col-
ors randomly onto something
white and make bank?

However, just because peo-
ple of authority on subjects
profess to know a complicated
solution to a problem, it doesn’t
mean that an easier answer
isn’t better. If you think that
the complicated jargon you are
learning in a class is bullshit,
then there’s a chance there’s an
easier answer.

So instead of spewing more
paragraphs of broad generaliza-
tions, I thought that I would ap-
ply this theory to three problems
I ran across over the summer.

For these three situations,
so called experts on the subject
consistently made something
simple seem much more multi-
faceted than it really was.

The ﬁrst major problem I
encountered this year was eye
contact.

Like many of you in‘ the
ADD generation, I tend to let
my eyes stray throughout the
day. During a lecture or a party,

it’s hard to keep from scan-

ning the room and see what
the rest ofthe world is up to.

So why is it when two
eyes randomly meet, espe-
cially from people of war-
ring sexes, there suddenly
becomes a flurry of mental
commotion?

You know what I’m talk-
ing about. Everytime eyes
randomly lock, there is that
inner ﬂutter instinctively es-
calating the situation.

There are three responses
every person has when com-
ing into sudden eye contact
with a stranger.

A) Upon eye contact,
an all-out offensive into
the peers subconscious be-

gins. The pupils are penetrated
against their will.

The look is accompanied
with a supposedly coy smile
that either says “I caught you
"red-handed” or “There’s an
open closet I know of that
seems lonely without you and
me inside it.”

B) When looking eyes,
the stranger changes a flat‘ex-
pression into one of aghast dis-
gust. The recipient is certain
that you, the initiator ofthe eye
contact, have been staring at
this person for the last hour des-
perately hoping for him or her
to acknowledge your presence.
By recoiling, he or she is telling
you to take down the shrine you
made in your closet from his or
her used gum.

C) Finally, most of the
time when two parties engage
in random eye contact, they turn
their attention sharply to some-
thing else. The best time for this
is in the library or at church or
synagogue when embarrassed
students go from initiating the
eye contact to suddenly check-
ing the ceiling for bats.

By engaging in easily the
stupidest human reﬂex, we all
pretend that by turning away
quickly, the other party will
probably just ﬁgure he or she
was mistaken in thinking that
you made eye contact.

Throughout adolescence, I

over-complication came when
news networks started cover-
ing the Deepwater Horizon oil
spill.

Every day, I had to hear
about how the magnitude of
this spill would rival the ef-
fects of Hurricane Katrina and
Exxon Valdez.

I also got hear, repeatedly,
about how BP was so evil that
they were replacing CEO Tony
Heyward with Jafar. I had to
hear about how Obama was
screwing this whole mess up
and should be impeached for
such a gross disregard for jus-
tice. "

According to the media,
this mess was going to have
consequences not seen since
the movie “Z012.” Jobs would
irreparably suffer and the Gulf
environment was damaged for-
even ‘

But guess what? BP and
Obama actually went about it
the right way. There weren’t
too many grand gestures and
sweeping overhauls, but have
you heard anything about oil in
the Gulflately?

The media silence is because
instead of detonating a nuclear
bomb at the bottom of the gulf,
BP took their time covering the
leak (they permanently covered
the leak yesterday) and weeks
later found out that 75 percent
of the dangerous light, sweet

Instead of focusing on all the various details

of how he or she looked at you, or what BP

was going to do with the spilled oil—or what
the Greenwich Boys and Girls Club had to
do with the Miami Heat—just ﬁnd the answer

in the basics.

 

made way too much of these
ocular encounters. My friends
and I would go into tremendous
detail analyzing every little ac-
cidental gaze.

It wasn’t until I started giv-
ing out the B look of feigned
disgust that I realized how stu-
pid all this was.

Instead of reacting so much
when we meet someone’s eyes,
why don’t wejust acknowledge
and continue? 99 percent ofthe
time that’s all we want to do
anyway.

My second problem with

crude oil in the gulfhad already
completely evaporated.

BP’s stock has more than
paid the price for the mistake,
and life is getting back to nor-
mal. Instead of turning into a
Katrina or an Exxon Valdez,
this spill was more like Ixtoc,

Mexico in I979 and the Gulf»

War oil spill in 1991. There’s
a reason you haven’t heard of
these spills. It’s because they
had an equally simple solution,
and their spilled oil evaporated
just as quickly. ‘

My ﬁnal major problem with

Solving problems the easy way

Issues in personal and private lives tend to get needlessly over-complicated when it comes to ﬁnding the right solution

over-complication came during
the most important event of the
summer: LeBron taking his tal-
ents to South Beach.

Being an ESPN addict, I
scoured the Internet daily to
ﬁnd out LeBron’s possible mo-
tives behind playing second
ﬁddle to Dewayne Wade.

I spent hours researching the
legitimacy of Delonte West’s
alleged affair with LeBron’s
mom during the playoffs last
year

I followed Twitter accounts,
listened to Stephen A. Smith
and used pretty much every
other embarrassing method of
attaining information on LeB-
ron.

This turned out to be a huge
waste of time. Well, obviously
it was because I was reading
about a free agent signing in
a professional sport, but even
in that realm I should have fo-
cused on the obvioussolution
that was staring me in the face.

LeBron ultimately had to
choose between living in Chi-
cago, Cleveland, New York or
Miami for at least the next ﬁve
years of his life. Keep in mind
that he .wouldn’t live in his
home city during the summer
because he will be busy doing
basketball camps around the
world.

So basically, LeBron had to
choose between spending Sep-

’ tember through June in Chi-
cago, Cleveland, New York or
Miami.

Are you serious? What 25
year-old who is getting paid
to play a sport is choosing to
live in the cold and snow when
there is a beach with clubs adja-
cent to it?

Seriously, who isn’t making
the same decision as LeBron
there? ~

Instead of focusing on all
the various details of how he or
she looked at you, or what BP
was going to do with the spilled
oilﬂor what the Greenwich
Boys and Girls Club had to do
with the Miami Heat—just ﬁnd
your answer in the basics.

Its really that simple.

Getting physical with

Campus Rec encourages W&L students to become involved in one of its many activities

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

Campus Recreation is one
of the largest organizations on
Washington and Lee’s campus.
Whether you’re looking for ex-
ercise classes, an outdoor adven-
ture or intramural team sports,
Campus Rec provides opportuni-
ties for all students to stay active.
Campus Rec encompasses many
of the university’s extracurricu-
lar trips and activities.

James Dick oversees Campus
Rec and has developed the pro-
gram to itscurrent state. Before
his arrival as director of Campus
Rec, the Athletic Department
and various other departments

oversaw branches of the organi-
zation. Dick absorbed many of
those responsibilities and now
directs a major hub of student
extracurricular life.

Campus Rec staff hires na-
tionally certiﬁed instructors for
all group exercise classes. The
teaching staff is a mix of profes-
sional instructors, W&L faculty
members and even some stu-
dents.

Campus Recreation hopes to
offer a certiﬁcation course to all
students interested in becoming
certiﬁed instructors.

Campus Rec started off the

academic year with a series of
events such as a free zumba class,
a rafting trip and an introduction
to salsa class.

This year’s additions to the
Campus Rec offerings include
group exercise classes featuring
kickboxing and zumba, club wa-
ter polo and club disc golf have
been added. James Dick has re-
designed the ropes course that
is a part of the Outing Club, and
even offers a new PE class on the
ropes course.

92 percent of W&L students
participate in intramural sports,
one of Campus Rec’s offerings.

W&L’s participation rate rivals
that of larger universities rate,
according to Ray Ellington,
Campus Rec’s Assistant Director.
Many compete for their respec-
tive sororities or fraternities, but
any student or group can register
a team for any intramural sport.
Flag football and basketball are
the two most popular intramural
sports.

Campus Recreation’s broad
offerings also include Washing-
ton Break and Spring Break trips
to many different locations. A
vacation to the Outer Banks in
North Carolina entails kayaking,

ﬁshing, and sightseeing. Another
trip to New Mexico offers hiking
and a trip to a hot spring.

The Outing Club also spon-
sors PE 195, a scuba diving in-
struction class offered Fall Term
and Spring Term. Students can
also rent equipment for many
outdoor activities from both the
Outing Club and from intramu-
rals. Equipment for ultimate fris-
bee, bocce ball and even poker is
available for rent.

This year, Campus Rec made
changes to the registration pro-
cess. A simpliﬁed registration
for all branches of Campus Rec

Campus Rec

is on the W&L website. All re-
quired forms are also available
for download from the website.

Alum teaches children through lyrics

William Avery, class of ‘9I, seeks to enlighten children through his music and songs in his CD “Learning Buﬂet”

By Julie Hansen
STAFF WRITER

At Washington and Lee, the
liberal arts education encourages
and ignites interdisciplinary con-
nections and passions among its
students. It is this ability to ap-
proach singular subjects from
multiple disciplines that stays
with W&L students their entire
lives. In this case, I’m talking
about William Avery, W&L class
of ’9l.

During his years here, he said
he used music as an outlet for
stress, gaining most of his inspi-
ration from -hectic ﬁnals weeks.
In fact, while his fellow students
were cramming, Avery spent his
time playing piano. To the sur-
priseof his friends, it was those

piano sessions that helped him ‘

pass. By focusing on a creative
outlet, Avery used his personal
talents to distract and relax him-
self. Feeling like you’re prepared
really is half the battle.

His sophomore year, Avery

had the chance to study abroad
in Taiwan, where he met his fu-
ture wife (don’t get too excited,
Generals: W&L does not guar-
antee love with any of its study
abroad programs). After retum—
ing to W&L to ﬁnish his major,
Avery returned to Taiwan for
the love of his life. There, he
spent 10 years teaching English
as a second language, published
educational materials and even
tried his hand at acting. Since
he learned Chinese at W&L, he
hosted an educational children’s
show for teaching Chinese!
Now, this takes us back to
the present. After returning to
the United States and pursuing a
career in computers, Avery never
lost his love of children, educa-
tion and music. This is where
“Leaming Buffet” comes in, a
32 track CD that features songs
about everything from the ABCs
to different, difﬁcult phonics

tones, to the months and even the
skeleton! My personal favorites
are “America, the Grand Tour
(50 State Capitals)” and “ABC
Chant—ABC Animals.”
Musically, “Leaming Buf-
fet” tends to fall short. While
the introductory track, “Really
(lnstrumental)” was quite musi-
cally sound, the rest of the CD
focuses much more on mono-
tone “rapping” and synthesizer.
Now, as I am over 10 years old
and have no younger siblings, I
cannot fully predict a child’s ap-
preciation of this music. How-
ever, it seems that without basic
tunes for children to follow it
might be more difﬁcult for them
to remember the words. Look at
The ABC Song, the Alphabetical
State Song and the planet song
from “Blue’s Clues”... I still
sing those songs in my head
when looking through a diction-
ary, counting license plates or

studying astronomy.

Also, a lot of Avery’s words
are a bit sophisticated for a
younger audience. While “Read-
ing is Fundamental” deﬁnitely
made me giggle, I’m not so sure
that little kids will be able to fol-
low his words so quickly. And,
again, almost every single song
makes excessive use of synthe-
sizer. Avery might be better off
focusing on exposing children to
higher quality and more complex‘
music to which they might not be
otherwise exposed. Synthesized,
auto-tuned songs ﬁll the radio
these days, along with droning
lyrics that blur together. Avery
should take this opportunity to
use his musical talents to focus
on making music that children
can enjoy and that will encour-
age them to appreciate different
instruments and styles, rather
than just the current popular cul-
tural trends. v

While I’m not the keenest on
his musical styles, I must stress
that many of his songs do pres-
ent important information for
children to learn that may not be
so prevalently taught in schools,
including “American Presidents”
and “My Good Friend (Learn
Chinese).” I mean, I’m a col-
lege freshman and I still don’t
know all of the state capitals,
the bones in the body or the US
Presidents-«let alone in chrono-
logical order!

Either way, Avery has simply
made an excellent effort in fol-
lowing his passions while pre-
senting elementary knowledge
that the whole family should
have. If he uses the outstanding
information that he is present-
ing in “Leaming Buffet,” and
instead sets it to more complex,
instrumentally driven music of
which I am sure he is capable,
with clever sing-along tunes, he

will no doubt be a great success.
Whether or not Avery contin-
ues making music for children,
I’ll be listening to “American
Presidents” on my iPod until l’ve
got all 44, and their respective
facts, down pat. My US History
teacher would be so proud.

Working alongside Cy Twombly

Local professor spoke to W&L students about her experience working with the esteemed artist in Paris

By Mary Helen Turnage
STAFF wrmsn

This past Wednesday, Profes-
sor Barbara Crawford of South-
ern Virginia University gave a
lecture about her experiences
working at the Louvre with artist
Cy Twombly, W&L class of] 953.
Lenfest’s Keller Theater was full
of students, faculty members and
Rockbridge County locals who
wanted to hear ﬁrst-hand about
Crawford’s work at perhaps the
most celebrated art museum in
the world.

As she clicked through doz-
ens of photographs projected on
the screen behind her, Crawford
described the intricate process

Wine festival succeeds again

of installing a modern mural for
the ceiling ofthe Louvre’s classi-
cally decorated Salle des Bronz-
es. Twombly asked Crawford to
come to Paris to mix the colors
for the colossal painting he de-
signed. Nothing less than perfec-
tion was acceptable. Crawford
discussed the hours of analyzing
she did in the studio and in the
Salle des Bronzes in order to ﬁnd
the ideal blues, grays, and yel-
lows for the mural.

Though the Louvre could
have afforded any technology
for the project they desired, the
staff relied on the human eye to

judge the colors effectively. With
such limited use of technology,
Crawford kept notes in excru-
ciating detail of the percentages
and dabs of paint used for the
mural. Throughout the lecture,
Crawford alluded to David and
Goliath to describe her experi-
ence with the giant mural in such
a respected museum. She kept
notes and dabbed paint on 8xll
paper and stored the excruciat-
ingly analyzed paint in plastic
food containers.

When the correct colors
for the mural had been ﬁnally
chosen, it was time to paint

the several canvases to cover
the ceiling. In order to capture
Twombly’s famous artistic spirit
and rhythm, the staff used’ all
sorts of brushes—even different
kinds of brooms.

The gluing of the painted can-
vases to the ceiling took a total
of two months. During this tran-
sitional period, a covered corri-
dor served as the passageway in
the Salle des Bronzes for Louvre
tourists to walk from one wing of
the museum to the other.

Professor Crawford described
the ﬁnal product as “perfect”
and proudly stated that critics

referred to the ceiling mural as
an experience “like being under-
water and in the sky at the same
time.” When an audience mem-
ber asked to hear her favorite
part of the experience, Crawford
did not hesitate to answer that
the camaraderie of the staff was
the best part of her work at the
Louvre.

“Having seen the exhibit this
Spring Term when l was visiting
the Louvre, I was so impressed
and intrigued by it that I didn’t
even think about how they cre-
ated and ‘installed something of
that size, said junior art history

major Emily Rigame. “Hearing
Barbra Crawford speak about the
process made me realize just how
impressive and groundbreaking
the installation is.” Art history
majors and non-majors, as well
as many of Professor Crawford’s
SVU students attended the rivet-
ing lecture.

The annual Rockbridge Wine Festival set record attendanceion September I] at the Lime Kiln Theatre

By Marie Locke
STAFF WRITER

On a beautiful fall day last
Saturday, students, local resi-
dents and tourists headed to the
Lime Kiln Theater for the six-
teenth annual Rockbridge Wine
Festival. The festival featured an
appealing combination of food,
wine tasting and music provided
by Pop Rivets.

The festival was sponsored
and organized by the Rockbridge
County Chamber of Commerce.
It featured twelve vineyards, each
of which brought several dif-
ferent wines for tasting. Bottles

of wine were also available for
purchase. Sammy Moore, execu-
tive Director of the Chamber of
Commerce, said that the invited
vineyards are generally within an
hour or two’s drive of Lexington.
He noted that there are about 20
vineyards in Charlottesville and
Albemarle County. Many medal
winners from the Virginia Wine
Competition were represented,
including Barboursville Vine-
yards, DelFosse Vineyards and
Winery, Fincastle Vineyard &
Winery, Horton Cellars Win-

ery and Kluge Estate Winery &
Vineyard.

Festival attendees were seri-
ous, yet enthusiastically tast-
ing the many different available
wines. Most festivalgoers paid
$10 to $15 (depending on ad-
vance or at-the-door purchase),
which entitled them to tastings
and a souvenir wine glass.But
mixed into the crowd were the
designated drivers who, in return
for their abstinence, received a
reduced admission fee.

In addition to the many inter-

esting wines, local restaurants
offered an array of tantalizing
treats for purchase. Participating
restaurants included the Southern
Inn, Virginia ‘Q and Salemo’s.
According to Moore, the fes-
tival was a great success, having
the largest attendance in the last
ﬁve years. There were approxi-
mately one thousand attendees.
About 60 percent of the crowd
consisted of local students and
residents. Moore thought it was
“ironic” to have a record year
when the festival was “as bare

bones and basic as it’s ever been.”
Proﬁts from the festival beneﬁt
the Chamber of Commerce.
Moore says he has already
started planning for next year.
He indicated that the Chamber of
Commerce is doing substantial
marketing research for next year ’s

festival. He noted that many of ,

the attendees have become aware
of the festival through the Inter-
net. There are also numerous re-
turn patrons, and local~W&L and
VMI students are always well
represented. Moore said he wel-

comes student volunteers at the
Chamber of Commerce. In past
years, students have provided
valuable marketing assistance.
Anyone who is interested should
contact Moore at the Chamber of
Commerce.

The Chamber of Commerce
is also planning a dinner dance in
February and a golf tournament
in June 2011.

1-1 in weekend play for Generals

W&L defeated Guilford 1-0 on Saturday, but fell to Greensboro 2-0 on Sunday

SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team knocked off its ﬁrst ODAC
opponent with a l-0 victory over Guil-
ford College on Saturday, but dropped its
second game of the season in a 2-0 loss

to Greensboro College on Sunday. The
Generals are now 2-2 overall and 1-0 in
ODAC conference play.

In the Guilford match-up, a shutout
from junior goalie Emily Leary and a
goal from sophomore midﬁelder Ainsley
Daigle secured the win for W&L. Daigle
ﬁred away early in the second half to
give the Generals the lead and silence the
Quakers.

“l wasjust really excited because we’ve
had so much trouble scoring,” Daigle said.
“We’ve gone into halftime without scor-
ing so manytimes.” ‘

W&L held a 7-5 advantage over Guil-
ford in shots and a 6-1 lead in corner
kicks.

On Sunday, the Generals put up a
tough ﬁght, but it wasn’t enough to hold
off the Pride of Greensboro College. Nei-

ther team crossed the goal line in the ﬁrst
half, but the Pride got off to an early lead
in the second half off ofa goal from ﬁrst-
year forward Mary Randolph. Another
goal from sophomore midﬁelder Meredith
Kelly late in the second halfset the Pride’s
lead at 2-0 and kept the Generals from a
comeback. 0

However, the lopsided scoreboard be-
trayed the shot count as the Generals led
the Pride 16-4 in shots. W&L also held a
7-1 advantage in corner kicks.

V “We just need to work on scoring,’
Daigle said. “That’s been our biggest is-
sue is to score early rather than let teams
hang around.”

The Generals will hit the road this
week as ODAC competition begins to
pick up. W&L will play at Randolph Col-
lege on Wednesday at ‘6 p.m. and then be
back on Watt Field on Saturday for an 1 1
a.m. match’-up against Eastern Mennonite
University. ‘
