Students fend for themselves
over Thanksgiving break

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

Not all students will be headed home this week-
end for Thanksgiving break.

According to Dean David Leonard, international

students and students from far away states frequent-

ly stay in Lexington during the break.

One such international student is sophomore Si
Young Kim.

Kim, who hails from South Korea, will be spend-
ing his second Thanksgiving break on campus this

. year. He doesn’t get to travel home very often to see

his family and friends in South Korea due to the high
cost of a plane ticket to his native country.

During his Thanksgiving break in Lexington last
year, Kim had to fend for himself for meals. This
was not easy for him, since as a freshman he had
grown accustomed to unlimited sandwiches, fro-yo,
etc. all of the time courtesy of D-Hall.

“I basically got fat,” Kim said, after explain-
ing that his diet during last year’s break consisted
of nothing but instant meals that he bought from
Kroger.

Now a more seasoned veteran when it comes to

“Mainly, I am expecting my break

to be a perfect rest. ”

Sl Young Kim, international student
 

surviving in Lexington during school breaks, Kim
has high hopes for this year.

He already has plans to take a trip to Washington
D.C. on the ﬁrst day of break to visit a Korean gro-
cery store and stock up on food that that has more
nutritional value than a Hungry Man TV dinner. He
plans on supplementing his healthier eating habits
with some exercise as well.

But Kim’s Thanksgiving Break will not just be
about staying ﬁt. He, like many other college stu-
dents on temporary hiatus from their schoolwork,
has a list of several movies that he is planning to
watch. Topping the list currently are Wallstreet,
Wallstreet II and The Social Network.

“Mainly, I am expecting my break to be a perfect
rest,” said Kim.

Kim might have more company this year in Lex-
ington than in the past. If they defeat their opponent
in the opening round of the NCAA Division III tour-
nament, the members of the ODAC-champion foot-
ball team will remain on campus over the break.

Because staying on campus for Thanksgiving
break is often a less than optimal choice for many
students, members of the Washington and Lee com-
munity have traditionally opened their doors to the
students who, for whatever reason, do not go home
for Turkey Day.

For the past two years the Pi Beta Phi House Di-
rector, Carol Garvis, hosted Thanksgiving dinners at
the Pi Phi sorority house. Garvis extended invita-
tions to the women and house directors who were on
campus on Thanksgiving Day, nomatter what soror-
ity they were in.

According to Garvis, about 20 guests came to
each of the dinners. After the feasting was through,
everyone played games like Scrabble or Apples to
Apples.

Garvis said that she would have hosted another
dinner this year were she not spending Thanksgiv-
ing in Copenhagen where her son, Professor Denny
Garvis, is on sabbatical.

Although Garvis cannot host a dinner here in
Lexington this year, her son seems to have inherited
his mother’s desire to share the spirit of Thanksgiv-
ing with others.

“He is inviting some W&L students that are
studying in Copenhagen over for Thanksgiving,”
said Garvis. “I guess the tradition will continue but
at a different location.”

Spring option: the only option?

Spring term boasts new “dream ” courses, but that may not encourage students to register

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Last spring term, spring option
was almost the only option for then
sophomore Keke Nichols.

Having spent fall term in Brazil
with the US-Brazil Exchange for
economics and environmental stud-
ies, she knew that despiteher great
experience studying abroad, neither
of those ﬁelds was her calling.

She then changed her major to
romance languages, and knew she
would need to take a class for her
major in the spring in order to stay
on track to graduate in time.

But the Spanish class she signed
up for wasn’t the spring term she was
used to.

“I wanted a more traditional
course,” said Nichols.

What she got was a class that met
five days a week for several hours a
day, and even involved community
service outside of class.

After the first day of classes, she
wanted to transfer out. She sent six
emails to professors to be admitted
to their classes. Three had already
admitted too many students and two
didn’t even reply.

Nichols’s advisor recommended
she simply take spring option. But

luckily the last professor had room ,

in his 200-level sociology class and
Nichols was able to stay on campus.

Her story seemed to be the an-
ecdotal buzz on campus last spring.
Everyone but the freshmen were nos-

talgic for the old spring term (an easy
class or two with lots of free time to
enjoy spring’s festivities).

This year’s spring term courses
were recently added to the registrar’s
page, leaving many students wonder-
ing if this year will be better.

But according to the numbers,
students weren’t nearly as unhappy
as they let on.

According to a satisfaction sur-
vey collected last year at the end of
spring term, 80 percent of students
were admitted to their ﬁrst choice
class. Even though not everyone was
initially satisﬁed, 97 percent said
they ultimately enjoyed their class.

Professor Marc Conner, direc-
tor of the new spring term, said that
Nichols’ case just happened to be the
“perfect storm.”

“That’s going to happen in the
ﬁrst few years of a large init?ative,”
Conner said.

And large initiative is an under-
statement.

Typically it takes 18 months for
a professor to develop anew course.
According to Conner, l 25 new cours-
eswere developed in less than a year
to prepare for the new spring term.

This was made possible through
workshops,
roundtable meetings and one impor-
tant question: “What is your dream
course?”

Although many professors leapt

course development, ’

at the chance, not all professors were
interested in teaching spring term
courses. Subsequently, it appeared
preregistration numbers indicated
that there would be too few courses
offered.

According to University Reg-

istrar Scott Dittman, spring option
numbers ballooned in March. “The
numbers weren’t even close,” said
Dittman.
‘ During preregistration in Decem-
ber, 90 students said they were con-
sidering spring option. By April, 165
had opted to take spring off.

It ended up being a tight fit for the
registrar. There was an 18% cushion,
or available room for students to ﬁll
a course, whereas in a typical semes-
ter there is a 25-30% buffer. Had all
the students not chosen to take spring
option, the cushion would have been
much smaller.

Even though a few courses have
been added to the course listings, it
will still be close as to the number of
courses offered and the students who
want to take them.

Dittman recommends that every-
one who is really interested in spring
option should declare so during win-
ter preregistration, and get a form
from the Ofﬁce of the Registrar,
which is strongly requested before
by March 4. A

While both Conner and Dittman

acknowledge that spring option is

right for some, with reasons varying
for studying for grad school exams
to getting internships or jobs, they
advise students to take classes if they
can.

“Stick around for spring term,”
said Dittman. ’

Spring term is a time to explore
and take classes outside of your ma-
jor, he said.

Conner admitted that even he’s
jealous of the opportunities, as he
looks at the listings and sees “l5
courses I’d like to take.”

Soon-to-be-approved courses in-
clude an interdepartmental course
on the physics of sound and an art
history course on Bollywood, with
more being added daily to the re-
cently posted listing.

This only adds to the plethora of
courses offered last year, from The
Science of Cooking to Digital Media
& Society to Biological Illustration.

These courses aren’t supposed to
be just another class to meet major
requirements, said Conner. lt’s a new
way of thinking and teaching for just
one term a year.

And hopefully, you’ll have a
chance at a course that will “change
your life.”

Seniors at/W&L answer the call

Job-hunting seniors turn to T each for America for teaching opportunities in low-income communities

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

College seniors are faced
with myriad options for alter
graduation, ranging from gradu-
ate school to fellowships to brav-
ing the murky waters of the job
market. But for some gifted,
passionate and talented students
there is a third option: Teach for
America.

Ever since its founding in
1990, Teach for America (TFA)
has placed teachers in under-
privileged schools throughout
the U.S. According to the pro-
gram website, TFA has “become
one of the nation’s largest pro-
viders of teachers for low-in-
come schools.”

Although TFA began with

only 500 teachers in six commu-
nities, numbers have risen sharp-
ly over the past 20 years. Accord-
ing to recruiter Matt Taylor, last
year’s 46,000 applications set a
record for the program. Taylor
said he thinks the TFA’s popu-
larity stems from “a growing
interest in public service and the
reputation [they] have developed
for achieving results with under-
served students over the past two
decades.”

Washington and Lee seniors
are no strangers to the opportuni-
ties in TFA. According to Taylor,
7 percent of the class of 2010 ap-
plied. Taylor credits the Shepherd
Poverty program for the high in-

terest from W&L students. ’

Senior Katie Tonneman, who
has already been accepted and
offered a job in south Louisiana,
also thinks that the many pov-
erty-related community service
and educational opportunities at
W&L peak student interest in the
program.

Tonneman said she heard
about TFA while in high school
and always kept it as an option
in the back of her mind. She
made the decision to apply at the
end of this summer. “I thought I
wanted to do something mean-
ingful before law school,” said
Tonneman.

Like Tonneman, senior Sar-

ah Warsco has graduate school
plans but is considering doing
TFA ﬁrst. Warsco wants to get
her doctorate in music, and she
said that teaching experience
before grad school will better
prepare her. “I really want an op-
portunity to teach,” said Warsco,
“and I want to be able to spend
that time somewhere I’d be help-
ing in the best possible way.”
The application process for
TFA is anything but simple. Ap-
plicants are required to submit
an initial application with stan-
dard resume information, plus a
complete list of every class they
have taken in college and the
grades they received. After sub-

mitting the initial application,
some potential teachers have a
phone interview while others,
like Warsco, skip ahead to a full-
day interview.

According to Tonneman, who
had her full-day . interview in
September, applicants who reach
that stage must put together a
lesson plan and teach other in-
terviewees. They must also com-
plete several small group activi-
ties as well as problem-solving
and writing activities.

Taylor said that although the
application process is lengthy, it
helps TFA select the best possible
teachers. “The many components
of our application process allows

us to get to know applicants bet-
ter as we look for the charactef-
istics that we’ve learned through
our 20 years of recruiting and
training teachers are predictors
of success in the classroom,”
said Taylor.

Warsco also sees the applica-
tion process as a way to weed out
people who are not really pas-
sionate about the work that TFA
does. She said she thinks TFA
is looking for people “with the
heart for teaching.”

“Everybody wants a job,”
said Warsco. “But you have to
want to teach, and you have to
want to help people.” ’

“It Gets Better” at Washington 8: Lee

GLBT Equality Initiative hosts event to share youtube videos from the national campaign in response to gay suicides

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

Students and faculty honored
Washington and Lee’s GLBT
community last Thursday by
gathering in the Commons to
watch videos from the “It Get
Better” project. ’

“It Gets Better” started as a
response to the increasing vis-
ibility of gay teen suicides in the
news. In these videos, openly
gay adults urge gay or question-
ing teens to value their own life
as they promise that everything
will get better.

Professor Theresa Braunsch-
neider began It [Gets Better at
W&L with one of her favorite
videos from the project, which
featured a couple named Dan
and Terry.

Braunschneider said she used
the “Little Red Riding Hood”
reference in the video as an ex-
cuse to e-mail it to her English
students, who were studying the
fable. V

“But I really just wanted
some way to spread the word
about this project which I admire
so much,” said Braunschneider.
Braunschneider and Professor
Ellen Mayock received positive
feedback leading up to the event.
The Women’s and Gender Stud-

ies program even donated re-
freshments.

The event itself attracted

around 50 people, who gathered

around to watch the video and
hear student testimonies.

Anthony Nardini, a 2008
W&L -graduate, contributed to
the event by describing his jour-

ney through W&L as a closeted
and then openly gay student.
“I’m happier about who I am
because I’m not trying to hide
anything anymore,” said Nardi-
ni, who described coming out to
his friend in Leybum Library as
a weight lifting from his shoul-
ders.

At first he anticipated W&L
being another version of high
school and even thought about
transferring. But then, he said,
he found a support group who
accepted him as he was.

“It’s not an easy place to be
out,” said Braunschneider of
the social environment at W&L.
She said that most GLBT stu-
dents end up transferring.

The goal of last Thursday
was to celebrate and affirm
GLBT students at W&L through
the “It Gets Better” project.

It was also a follow up to the,

candlelight vigil in late October
that honored gay teen suicides
through a moment of silence.
This event, however, was
much louder and had a celebra-
tory rather than somber nature.
When the people in the videos
mentioned bullying, the crowd
hissed and booed, but when

they talked about how life got
better, the crowd cheered.
First-year Jeromey Mann also
took a turn showing the audience
his favorite videos. Both clips
were lighthearted and at times
funny, but the ultimate message
was directed at teens struggling
through bullying and abuse.
According to Braunshneider,
although programs like the John-
son Scholarship and Questbridge
have helped W&L increase di-

versity and tolerance, there is

still a lot of work to do. Some
groups are still struggling for ac-
ceptance or are completely unac-
knowledged.

“Lesbians are invisible at this
school,” said Braunschneider.

Two of the videos from the
event featured women talking
about their lives as lesbians. The
ﬁrst was a college ﬁrst-year only
four months out of high school,
who talked about how much
her life has improved in her few
years at college.

GOP could have done more to affect western political races

Despite a hugely successful midterm season, Republicans left a little to be desired in the key area of the Sun Belt

By John Paul Beall
COLUMNIST

They Should Have Said “I’m
Meltingll”

The Midterm Elections have
ﬁnally passed and the data gives
people the ability to reflect upon
the strategies ofthe political par-
ties involved.

While this election was clear-
ly a Republican victory in the
short run, GOP administrators
and party members alike need to
think about posterity.

The GOP, while having a
large following, has made sev-
eral miscalculations in strategy
that can only be linked to the
absence of strong leadership in
the upper echelons of the party
structure.

This election was disastrous
for Democrats, particularly in the
house. States that lean Democrat
found themselves under the at-
tack ofa crimson tidal-wave that
spread across much of the East
Coast and the Midwest.

Many positions assumed to
be secured by the Democrats

went Republican, with a few
pop-up Independents, like Rhode
Island’s Governor.

Many high-proﬁle Democrats
bit the dust, like Senator Fein-
gold of Wisconsin. However,
the GOP seemed to slip up in the
West.

and Nancy Pelosi are all inﬂuen-
tial Representatives from Cali-
fornia who were not unseated,
and against all odds, Harry Reid
of Nevada has survived to tell
the tale.

Barbara Boxer of California
came out on top of a close race

Thurmond-in the Sixties.
Republicans also lost the gu-
bernatorial seat of California (if
you consider Schwarzenegger a
Republican) to an old hat in the
California Democratic Party,
Jerry Brown (a former governor
with a poor record), against one

Because while critical gains could have been made in the West, the

Republican Party was concentrating in the East, boosting for people
like Rand Paul for Kentucky Senator (a race that was pretty safely his

from the moment he announced intention to run). while leaving strong

candidates in highly contested races like those in the West out for the

wolves.

The West is not necessarily
as liberal as many believe, but
regardless the area is a veritable
hotbed for high proﬁle Demo-
crats. Maxine Waters, Joe Baca,

against a likely winner Carly
Fiorina, and the Republicans’
endorsed candidate for Senate in
Alaska lost to the ﬁrst successful
write-in campaign since Strom

of the most dynamic Republican
candidates the nation has seen
since Reagan, Meg Whitman.
As a matter of fact, the west-
ern coast-line north of San Fran-

cisco and many of the districts
along the southem border held
blue.

If all odds spoke for Repub-
licans to win, and the areas in-
volved are not generally liberal
in bias, why did this occur?

Because while critical gains
could have been made in the
West, the Republican Party was
concentrating in the East, boost-
ing for people like Rand Paul for
Kentucky Senator (a race that
was pretty safely his from the
moment he announced intention
to run), while leaving strong can-
didates in highly contested races
like those in the West out for the
wolves.

While Obama was out sweep-
ing the nation and trying to whip
up support, the Republicans have
no one who could do so, a fault
that the leadership of the GOP
can surely claim.

Furthermore, as demographi-
cal changes demonstrate a shift
in emphasis from the Rust Belt to

the Sun Belt, places in the South
and the West will be picking up
importance in the electoral pro-
cess (California has 56 electoral
votes as of 2010).

Republicans used poor strat- I

egy putting up a weak effort in
such important areas while in-
stead rallying areas in the East,
which for the most part are slow-
ly losing inﬂuence.

Those of us who are Republi-
cans can still all applaud the his-
toric turnout ofthis election. Still
we must be skeptical of our party
leadership (what little there is),
because while the gains Demo-
crats made were those made by
the Party, those made by Repub-
licans were largely the result of
public referendum.

Those losses and important
missed opportunities of the GOP
are casualties of Party tunnel-vi-
sion and lack of good strategy.

Congratulations to all candi-
dates and their families.

OMG, Emma Watson has short hair: the world must be over

Pat Smith contemplates life is true meaning after one tragic haircut shattered all his childhood hopes and dreams

I was casually surﬁng our
campus’ ferociously high-speed
Internet one day in the library
(hah), and went to the Yahoo
homepage. The front headline
that appeared was something so
obscene, so offensive, and so not
fair. Brace yourselves...

Emma Watson pulled a Brit-
ney Spears.

It was one of the hardest days

of my life. To see such a great

Witch go to waste nearly broke
my heart.

I have been an avid Harry
Potter fan since day one and this
travesty ranks up there with the
death of Albus Dumbledore, Or-

der of the Merlin — First Class,
Chief Warlock of the Wizenga-
mot, Headmaster — Hogwarts
school of Witchcraft and Wiz-
ardry, Founder — Order of the
Phoenix (R.l.P.).

OK, she didn’t go full-on Brit-
ney Spears, but her hair is shorter
than mine. Imagine missing the
Hogwarts Express and having to
highjack a ﬂyingicar in order to
get to school. Yea, that’s kind of
how I felt. Bad, Bad Dobby.

Emma Watson is about the
same age as me so I don’t feel
bad in saying that I have had a
crush on her since the beginning.
lfl had even half the skills she

has as a Witch, I would be con-
tent for the rest of my life. But
now, the Whomping Willow has
crushed my heart, and I don’t
know what to think anymore.

I always knew I could win
over Hermione one day because
quite frankly, Ron is a "wuss.
But who to turn to now? I mean,
Ginny Weasley is kinda hot,.but
only a fool would,’ mess with
Harry Potter. Have you seen his
Patronus?

Now that my life is in sham-
bles, I’m debating whether to see
the new ‘movie coming or not. I
was so pumped to see the ﬁrst
installment of the seventh book,

but now that I know Emma Wat-
son has gone off the deep end, I
question myself.

How the Phi got its name...

Taken from the Sept. 25, 1974 issue, this article ﬁnally
provides the answer to a frequently asked question

This is an excerpt from an ar-
ticle which originally appeared
in the Dec. 5, I967, issue of
Ring-tum Phi.

In 1897, the same year that
the New York Post conferred
upon Lexington the title of“Ath-
ens of the South,” the Ring-tum
Phi was born at Washington and
Lee. The name of the ﬂedgling
journal was taken from what
was then considered a scandal-
ous football cheer.

The Phi began as both a
news publication and a compli-
ment to The Collegian, which
started as a fairly serious liter-
ary magazine and ended in 1968
as a humor magazine. The ﬁrst
editor-in-chief George Houston
ran a series of football songs in
the fourth issue which he appar-
ently thought were the type of
thing that the Phi was designed
to print. One of these songs was
that from which the name of the
paper was taken:

“Each other’s back, boys, '
Has got a knack, boys,
For making gains, sir,
Round the end.
And it’s a sin, sir,
For Oberlin (a W&L player),
sir, ,
To buck the V.M.I. boy’s line

So awful hard.
Thejoin the yell, boys,

And yell like h--I, boys,

Sure enough.

To W.&L.U., boys,
'And football, too, boys,
Let’s give a rousing,

Rumbling,

Roaring football yell.
Ring-tum phi, stickeri bum,
We’re hot stuff from Lexing-

ton.

Well, h--I broke loose. (End
excerpt)

The editor of the new pa-
per received an infuriated let-
ter from an anonymous “R” for
publishing such this “sinlet” on
the ﬁrst page of the paper, call-

ing it a “dark, purple crime.”
Times sure have changed.

We have no idea what Ring-
tum Phi means. We have tried
endless translations and creative
thinking, and the best we have
is that “tum” means “then” in
Latin, and “phi” is the symbol,
for the golden proportion.

Since we are lost, we want to
invite you to come up with your
own ideas for what this could
mean and e-mail them to phi@
wlu.edu. While you are at it, go
ahead and come up with some-
thing for “stickeri bum.” That
one is also beyond us.

Rejected article ideas from thisterm

Lacking any solid article ideas, Stockton Bullitt explains some rejects in his quintessential rambling, incolzerant style

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Sometimes, youjust need to call a spade a spade. I was not in the
mood to write an opinion article this week.

Most weekends, I can pound these babies out effortlessly, but the
anticipation for the Lions-Bills game was simply too much for me
to keep properly focused. So what do you do when you can’t think
of anything to write about? Use a cheap gimmick that makes it look

like you were trying.

Thankfully, this is a great week to use a BS gimmick for an ar-
ticle. The Ring-Tum Phi only has one more issue left in the ﬁrst
semester, and there’s no way that I won’t have plenty of entertaining
material after watching freshmen experience their ﬁrst Christmas

Weekend.

So, to keep you entertained, I present to you the seven articles
that just didn’t quite make the cut for the ﬁrst semester of this year.

All of these articles were either drunkenly discussed on Windfall
or seemed like legitimate articles up until I started to write them.
Unfortunately, either they were a little too controversial, offensive
or just plain stupid to stretch into a full article.

So, while you enjoy your time on the library bathroom toilet, en-
joy these article ideas that still beat anything published in the “Stall

Street Ioumal.”

Kanye West is an
iconic genius, which -
kind of sucks

Ever since I heard his ﬁrst
leak off his new album, I wanted
to write an opus convincing the
world that although Kanye is a
self-righteous douchebag, he is
still the greatest musical genius
ofthe last decade.

Yeah, that may sound like a
hyperbole, but if you take out
the unpopular “808’s & Healt-
break,” every one of Kanye’s al-
bums have been simultaneously
pop hits and far ahead of their
time music wise.

“College Dropout,” released
in 2004, sounded like music in
2006 and “Late Registration,”
released in 2005, sounded like
music in 2008.

amazing reviews. Here is what
Rolling Stone wrote in their ﬁve
star review of the album, which
drops on November 22: “lt’s his
best album, but it’s more than
that — it’s also a rock-star mani-
festo for a downsizing world. At
a time when we all get hectored
about lowering our expectations,
surrendering our attention spans,
settling for less, West wants us to
demand more.”

Even more stunning was a
rap mogul’s description of the

album: “Think about the ﬁrst
time you heard Midnight Ma-
rauders or Reasonable Doubt
or 36 Chambers. It’s hard to
take those feelings, sound sub-
ject matter and passion -- all of
those ingredients -- and take it a
step further. It’s stupid.”

So, you get it, people think
his music is good. But the nor-
mal counter to anyone praising
Kanye’s music is his complete
lack of sanity.

However, I have a feeling
Kanye knows a lot more than
you give him credit for. Just look
at how the Taylor Swift moment
at the VMA’s worked out for ev-
eryone involved. Kanye looked
like the bad guy, but still got
enough attention to keep people
interested in him in a year when
he didn’t release an album. Be-
yonce got to play victim while
still getting praised in public.

And Taylor Swift got the best
deal of all. She was able to gain
tons of fan loyalty and public
sympathy for free. Plus, she has
earned permanent empathy on
any situation even when her new
song “Dear John” sounds like it
was written by a bitter middle-
schooler who just discovered
that the boy world doesn’t com-
pletely revolve around her. Plus,
everyone seems to forget this,
but Kanye was freaking right.

Taylor Swift’s video for “You
Belong to Me” was pedestrian
at best, and I’m no diva, but Be-
yonce did have one of the best

videos of all time with “Single
Ladies.”

Still, there’s no way I could
make this into a legitimate arti-
cle. People have and always will
hate Kanye. George Bush won’t
forgive him. Taylor Swift won’t

really forgive him. His fans

won’t forgive him for “Love
Lockdown.” And more impor-
tantly, nobody will forgive him
for being as cocky as he is.

Despite him having a small-
er ego than Bono and Kenny
Powers, he’s the one who gets
viewed in the bad light. I guess
that’s what you get for liking ﬁsh
sticks.

How to write an ,
article in a school
publication

This article would’ve been
one giant hate on both “In-
General” and “MockCon.” The
only disappointing aspect of the
general lack of “I in 4” articles
this year is that I have no real
enemies to make jokes against.
I tried going after the Lexing-
ton Police, but unfortunately,
their police chief was too damn
accommodating and pleasant to
interview. So, after the Parent’s
Weekend editions of “lnGener-
al” and “MockCon” came out, I
thought that it’d be nice to throw
some cheap shots and make
some enemies.

I would’ve ﬁrst tried to ex-
plain to “lnGeneraI” what an
actual blind date is. I’m no ex-
pert, but I don’t think a blind
date is when two friends who
know each other well go out to
dinner without any romantic
expectations. I realize that it’s'
tough to convince anyone at
Washington and Lee to go on
an actual date (Oh, that’s just
me...um...nevermind), but
when you purport a section
of your magazine to be about
blind dates, at least try and
make it a charade.

With the “M ockCon” publi-
cation, I would’ve taken some
even cheaper shots, noting that
Career Services already does a
fantasticjob telling people how
to interview. Also, the whole
“we would tell you more sto-
ries, but” line is a waste of the
energy it took me to read that
sentence. That’s like going to
all of your friends and telling
them, “I have the greatest story
from last night, but I can’t re-
ally talk about it.” Itjust makes
people hate you.

I ended up not writing this
article for three main reasons.
First and foremost, I think you
can already tell that I was doing
some serious nitpicking there.
Overall, both publications were
fantastic, and any real criticism
I made just sounded a lot like
me calling the kettle black.
Second, I just wrote an article
hating on Republicans. Did
you really want another article
ﬁlled with “Haterade?” I didn’t
think so. Third, the editors of
both publications hold way too
much power at this school, and
I can’t waste any opportunities
to brown-nose. By the way,
“lnGeneral” is that a new top?
It looks radiant.

Hawto play -
preventdefense on
yoursisterduring
Parent’s Weekend

C’mon, tell me you’re not
reading this article. As every

older sibling knows full well,
there is nothing scarier than
bringing your younger sibling
out on a Friday or Saturday
night. Not only is there the worry
that he or she will see you for the
morally decrepit person you’ve
become, but he or she also has a
direct line to the parents, which
can always be dangerous.

Worse is when the younger
sibling gets out of your sights.
Usually, he or she ends up overly
drunk in a very precarious situ-
ation. And you’d never believe
this, but there is no shortage of
students at Washington and Lee
who wouldn’t mind hooking up

with a high school student. Who
would debase themselves so
much as to do that?

What this means is that the

entire night is spent either try-
ing to look as religiously pure
as possible or playing some
serious prevent defense on the
sibling. Some quality defensive
procedures include accidentally
inserting embarrassing child-
hood stories into conversation,
getting a cadet to bodyguard for
the night and keeping a “Call of
Duty: Black Ops” level recon on
the sibling at all times.

Overall, I would’ve loved to
write this article and was com-
pletely ready to implement all
my various strategies when my
eighteen year old sister visited
campus during Parent’s Week-
end. Sadly, nothing came to fru-
ition for one main reason. My
sister has something in common
with Veronica Mantooth and
Reggie Bush. She is a SAINT,
and would not do anything re-
motely incriminating ever. Yeah,
I’ll stick with that story.

Kevin Gamett and .
“cancer”:
not a big deal

There was a ruckus made
in the NBA over the past week
over an alleged comment Bos-
ton Celtic Kevin Garnett made
to another NBA player, Charlie
Villanueva. Garnett, a known
trash talker, allegedly called Vil-
lanueva a “cancer patient” dur-
ing a game. Villanueva, who
suffers from a skin disease that
prohibits him from growing hair
anywhere on his body, broke this
story over his Twitter account.

This story was beat to death
on ESPN and other sports news
outlets, and it quickly took the
Brett Favre’s Body Part Memo-
rial Award for dumbest news
story of the moment.

For one, Kevin Garnett tried
to back out of his comment by
saying that he called Charlie Vil-
lanueva “a cancer to his team
and the league.” C’mon KG,just
man up and admit what you said.
Watch any Celtics game, and ev-
ery cut to Garnett on the bench
features him dropping a different
version ofthe F-Bomb. Like he’s
going to resist the softball trash
talk line on Charlie Villanueva.

Much worse things are said
even in IM ﬁag football games
on campus here. Plus, I know
it’s brutally offensive and in bad
taste, but take the time to look
at Charlie Villanueva and try
not to laugh. He’s about as good
looking as Kenny Powers’ half
brother.

comAprehensIvegiant’ '
preview ofthe NBA

In early October, a friend of

mine sent me the 380 page Bas-
ketball Prospectus for this up-
coming NBA season. As my test
grades show, I spent most of the
month digesting all the informa-
tion I could. Say what you want
about the NBA, but this is the
best regular season product the
league has put out in years. 24
of the 30 NBA franchises have a
legitimately exciting element to
their game and far fewer teams
are employing the coasting
method that has alienated sports
fans for years.

To highlight how great this
season would be, I planned to
make some bold predictions
about the NBA. This would’ve
been a sweet idea until I remem-
bered that I am terrible at mak-
ing predictions. I was certain
that the Ivory Coast would be
this year’s dream team in the
World Cup. I convinced all of
my friends that “Avatar” would
be taken seriously. Most of all, I
knew that laMarcus Russell was
a lock for rookie ofthe year.

So, even though I did call the
success ofthe Golden State War-
riors and the New York Knicks,
I decided that I’d let the sports
section cover sports and stick to
the opinions section.

Hawto survive being
the token dumb
kid in class

Considering we all go to
Washington and Lee, I’m guess-
ing that most of us are pretty
smart students. However, now
that we’re in a pretty tough col-
lege, there will always be the
classes that seem like they are
taught in a different language.
Well, yeah some of them actu-
ally are, but you get my point.

Most of us didn’t spend our
high school careers being the
kid who simply could not grasp
the material no matter what was
said. So, I thought now that I’m
a junior and I’m getting very
good at being the token dumb
kid, I’d give some valuable ad-
vice to those new to the feeling.
See, instead of getting down on
yourself and checking out of the
class, strategy is most important
in the class you’re hoping to get
a C in.

There are some valuable strat-
egies to abide by when donning
the dunce cap in class. First, nev-
er sit in the front or in the back of
class. Sitting in front makes the
professor all too aware of your
blank stare while she is lectur-
ing, and sitting in back makes
you the target of the “I’m going

to call on a random member of -

the class to make sure he or she
is paying attention” method that
pretty much every liberal arts
teacher uses every lecture.
Second, get very good at hav-
ing your facial expressions mir-
ror the professor’s. So when the
professor is smiling and giddy,
you should look happy and gid-
dy yourself. When the profes-
sor is serious and focused while
lecturing, you need to seem just
as focused and serious about
the material. Couple this with
continuous eye contact with the
professor, and you’re guaranteed

at least ﬁve token pity points, '

which is really what you’re aim-
ing for in the dumb kid strategy.

Lastly and most importantly,
always talk to the professor.
You should not do this so you
can learn the material better,
but rather so you can improve
your grade by manipulating
every professor’s dream of mi-
raculously turning the dumb kid

in the class into a hard work-
ing genius. Say you didn’t do
the reading, then you deﬁnitely
should visit the professor to talk
about the material. Just shoot
out some line like “I worked for
hours on this material, but I feel
like I don’t understand a word,”
and boom, the teacher will buy it
hook line and sinker.

This really couldn’t be a le-
gitimate article because then the
secret of grade manipulation
would be over. Good thing my
professors didn’t make it this far
because otherwise, I’d actually
have to do the reading.

Over the last month, every
college from Eastern Washing-
ton to Harvard has come out
against Four Loko. If you’re
reading this in a bathroom stall,
you also might notice the ﬂyer
to the right of you calling for the
banishment of Four Loko.

Look, I get spreading aware-
ness for the potential dangers of
mixing alcohol and caffeine, but
calling for it to be made illegal is
more pointless than hiring a ma-
riachi band to accompany farm
animals.

Having had a Four Loko or
two in my life (and even writing
an article about it last year) has
given me some insight into the
drink. For one, everyone who
drinks a Four Loko has a pretty
good idea of what one are put-
ting into his or her body. It’s not
like people are drinking these
things for pleasure and acciden-
tally getting drunk.

Second, if you are going to
condemn college drinking just
for the sake of getting drunk,
don’t act like Four Loko is the
only enabler here. If you want to
go after Four Loko, then go after
shots, games like beer pong and
funnels. It’s not like Four Loko is
breaking any new ground here.

Lastly, all the attention these
health groups are giving Four
Lokos are working against them.
Like Pokemon, Miley Cyrus and
Razor Scooters, Four Lokos are
a fad. Once you drink enough of
them, they tend to get old after
a while. Instead of letting the
fad run its course, these health
groups are givingmore attention
and coverage to the drink.

Letting people know that they
will feel less drunk while still
having the same damaging ef-
fects is not exactly stopping any
college student from drinking a
Four Loko. If you really want to
get people to cut down on their
drinking of Four Loko, just ﬁlm
students who are eight to twelve
loko deep, and show them the
next day how intelligent they
sound. End of story.

International House hosts eye-opening film screening

Film exposes the cruel and devastating lives of sugar cane cutters in the Dominican Republic

By Nay Lin
STAFF wrmen

International House hosted a
screening of the ﬁlm “The Price
of Sugar” and followed it with
a discussion panel. The screen-
ing attracted over 50 students,
faculty and staff from a variety
of disciplines, ranging, from En-
vironmental Studies and Ceram-
ics (Reeves Center) to Romance
Languages and Economics.

The idea for the movie screen-
ing was motivated by a similar
screening event hosted by United
Nations Associations for United
States ofAmerica (UNAUSA) in
New York City.

The movie shows the be-
hind-the-scenes view of sugar
from the perspective of Father
Christopher Hartley. The priest
traveled to the Dominican Re-

public to improve the Haitian
sugar cane cutters’ living situa-
tion. Haitians’ desperate needs
for jobs led them across borders
to Dominican Republic’s sugar
plantation ﬁelds where they were
paid minimally in vouchers to
exchange food and kept under
armed guard called bateyes.

Cane cutters suffered from
malnutrition and had to rely on
sugar cane as the only nutrition
source. Jhonny Belizaire says, “I
am not afraid because I believe
there is no death worse than
this.”

At one point in the movie,
Father Hartley says, ‘‘I’m sure
most American families would
be embarrassed to know at what
price they putsugar in their cof-

fee every morning."

The discussion following the
movie focused on how the Unit-
ed State’s sugar protectionism
factorslinto this situation and the
idea that the free trade of sugar
could be a possible solution. The
impact of sugar on the consump-
tion of tea, coffee and cocoa in
the United States, as well as the
alternatives for sugar such as
maple syrup, corn, honey and ap-
ple, were also explored. Panelists
included Mike Smitka, Professor
of Economics, Susan Dixon,
Professor ofFrench, Leah Green,
Professor of Environmental
Studies and English, Ron Fuchs,
Reeves Center Curator, Laura
Henry-Stone, Post-Doctoral Fel-
low of Environmental Studies

and senior Cailin Slattery, the
100 Projects for Peace winner,
who spent her summer working
with a microﬁnance organization
in the Dominican Republic.)

In the spirit of the occassion,
Amy Richwine prepared Haitian
snacks - Coconut bread, Pain Pa-
tat (Sweet Potato Bread), Banane
Pese (Fried Plantain) and Pine-
apple Nog that were served be-
fore the screening.

The mission of the Interna-
tional House is to promote inter-
national learning by facilitating
interaction and communication
between students and members
of the W&L community.

Arts League will host Holiday Art Sale

W&L Arts League is accepting donated pieces of art from the community to sell at an art sale before Christmas break

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

The Arts League of Wash-
ington and Lee is sponsoring a
holiday art sale for the ﬁrst time.
The sale will be held on Wednes-
day, December 1 from 4' p.m. to
7 p.m. in Wilson Hall.

The league is currently col-
lecting art from students and fac-
ulty, and will continue to do so
until the end of the week. Com-

munity members are encouraged
to attend.

The pieces will be sold for
less than $100 each and the prof-
its will go towards a trip to New
York City.

“We thought that selling art
would be an appropriate way to
raise money for a trip to visit art
galleries and museums in New

York City," said freshman lva
Weidenkeller.

Half of the selling price for
each piece will be given to the
artist and the other towards the
Arts League. The group is hop-
ing to travel to New York over
the first weekend of Washington
Holiday in February.

“We’re hoping that this sale

can raise a lot of money for the
trip and for Arts League, provide
a lot of people with Christmas
presents, and give some students
and local artists some good ex-
posure.”

Refreshments and music will
be provided at the event, as well
as holiday cheer while Christmas
shopping. Students may submit

their aitwork by ﬁlling out forms,
which are posted around Wilson
Hall, by the end ofthis week.
The Arts League will host
similar events in the future and
encourages all interested stu-
dents tojoin. ‘
“[Arts League] is not just
for visual artists, but musicians,
dance performers, art historians,

and basically anyone who wants
to see and interact with more art
on campus.”

For more information about
participating in the Holiday Arts
Sale or to take part in other ac-
tivities, e-mail artsleague540@

W&L Women continue to innpress

The swimming team racked up its third straight victory as they took down Sweet Briar last Friday an

By Jayna Johns
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s'
swimming team is on a roll as it cap-
tured two victories in two meets the past
couple of weekends. in one of those

‘ meets, a relay team broke a pool record
that had stood since 1984.

Last Saturday, November 6, the
women took down Randolph-Macon in
Lexington with a score of 153-102 in
their ﬁrst conference meet.

Friday, the women travelled to Sweet
Briar and came away with a 145-106
win. The Generals now post a 3-1 sea-
son record and have not lost since the
season opener.

Against Randolph-Macon, six swim-
mers took home individual ﬁrst-place
ﬁnishes in eight events. The Yellow

Jackets managed to win both relay
events, although one of those the Gen-
erals missed by less than a quarter of a
second.

Sophomore Delaney Rolfe touched
in ﬁrst in two events. She swam the 200
yard free style in 1:59.84 and the 500
yard free style in 5:23.24. Junior Katie
Salvati also won two events, coming
in ﬁrst in the 100-yard backstroke in
1:03.32 and in the 200 yard backstroke
in a time of 2:14.06.

Sophomore Ann McCampbell won
the 1000 yard freestyle in 11:06.95, and
fellow sophomore Brittany Ross took
the 200 yard butterﬂy in 2:15.49. Junior
Dana Fredericks swam the 200 yard
breaststroke in a time of 2:35.31_and

ﬁrst-year Lauren Kasoff won the 100
yard butterﬂy in 1:02.50.

The Generals had the top three ﬁn-
ishers in the 1000 yard freestyle, the 100
yard backstroke and the 200 yard but-
terﬂy.

The following Friday, an exhibition
team consisting of_Fredericks, sopho-
more Izzy Brassﬁeld and ﬁrst-years
Rebecca Lawrence and Meredith Hardy
broke a 26 year old record after ﬁnishing
the 200 yard freestyle relay in a time of
1:53.06.

The women’s day followed that
success as they collected eight indi-
vidual victories and one relay win, de-
spite swimming competitively in only
11 events. They swam the other three

events as exhibitions, so their ﬁnishes
in those races did not count towards the
ﬁnal score.

Fredericks won two of her events,
coming in ﬁrst in the 100 yard back-
stroke in 1:10.86 and the 100 yard free-
style in 1:02.25. . ‘

Senior Tess Hayden won the 400
yard freestyle in a time of4:46.46. Rolfe
came in ﬁrst in 2:32.68 to take the 200
yard butterﬂy, and McCampbell took the
200 yard backstroke in 2233.67.

The team’s younger swimmers had
a successful day as well, as three ﬁrst-
year swimmers had top ﬁnishes. Kasoff
touched in in a time of 2:16.79 to win
the 200 yard freestyle, Alexandra Vi-
ers ﬁnished in 1:25.57 in the 100 yard

set a pool

breaststroke and Michelle Szymczak'~

came in in 3:02.02 to take the 20() yard
breaststroke.

The relay team consisting of Hayden,
sophomore Stephanie Krasnov, junior
Erin Schwartz and senior Becky Guynn
brought home the ﬁnal ﬁrst-place ﬁnish
for W&L, winning the 200 yard medley
relay in 2:13.02.

The women will return to the pool
on Nov. 20 as they travel to Franklin &
Marshall to compete against Rochester,

Carnegie Mellon and Franklin & Mar-

shall at 11:00 a.m.

Football ODAC Champs! 

A historical season for the Generals continues on as NCAA playoﬁfs loom

By Jayna Johns

SPORTS EDl_TOR

They were expected to ﬁnish ﬁfth in a
conference of only seven teams. It made
sense, really. They were young, they were
inexperienced and they were coming off
back-to-back losing seasons. Even their
head coach understood that this did not
look like it was going to be their year.

“I didn’t expect this to happen this year.
Maybe next year, but not this one,” Head
Coach Frank Miriello said.

Looks like someone forgot to tell the
team that.

The Washington and Lee football team
shattered expectations while breaking re-
cords in a historical season capped by a
45-3 dismantling of Juniata College last
Saturday.

But that wasjust icing on the cake. The
real prize was winning the ODAC title
while posting a perfect conference record
for the first time in school history.

Before a packed Parent’s Weekend
crowd on Nov. 6, the Generals sailed
by previously-unbeaten conference foe
Hampden-Sydney 38-27 to claim the title.
The score only looks that close because
of a Tiger touchdown with seven seconds
left on the clock that meant nothing to the
game’s ﬁnal outcome. W&L took a 31-I4
lead early in the fourth quarter and never
looked back.

Saturday’s crowd packed the stands,
while many more fans were left to ﬁnd a
place to stand. And the crowd’s presence
was felt by the team.

“The atmosphere...was just electric,”
said sophomore running back Brett Mur-
ray, who rushed for 95 yards and two
touchdowns in the game.

Coach Miriello seemed to agree, say-
ing the team historically responds well to
large crowds. “I wish we could have ﬁve
parent’s weekends,” he said.

Even more surprising than the number
of people was that the W&L crowd, infa-
mous for leaving games at half-time, stuck
with the team through the very end, a de-
tail that the team noticed gratefully.

“And the crowd stayed!” Miriello ex-
claimed, adding emphatically, “Thank
God they stayed.” -

The Generals added to their already im-
pressive resume with a routing of Juniata.
Any worry that the team would lose focus
was put to rest early as sophomore running
back Luke Heinsohn pulled off a 63 yard
run in W&L’s ﬁrst offensive play of the
game. Junior running back Harrison Hud-
son found the end zone two plays later.

W&L was leading 21-0 before Juniata
managed to get on board in the ﬁnal min-
utes of the ﬁrst half. The General’s de-
fense absolutely dominated, allowing only
a 29-yard ﬁeld goal for the entire game.
This marks the ﬁrst time this season the
General’s kept their opponent out of the
end zone. ,

The win over Juniata marks the ﬁrst
time since 1981 that W&L football has
had eight wins in regular season play, and

the ﬁrst time since 1961 that the program
has won seven games in a row. That year,
W&L went undefeated and was named
the best small college team in the nation,
according to generalssportscom. There
were no conferences in Division lll foot-
ball that year.

The past two games show just how
much the team has improved. This season
did not begin promisingly, as the Generals
opened by getting “waxed” by Franklin
& Marshall, said Miriello. They followed
with a promising win over Sewanee, giv-
ing the team “a ray of hope,” only to “give
one away” against Averett, a game in
which they were leading 10-0 going into
the fourth quarter and fell apart, giving up
20 unanswered points.

At this point, the team looked like they
were going to live up to earlier expecta-
tions. But something changed within the
team.

being close. Perhaps most astounding is
their ability to end an opponent’s drive
with a turnover. Throughout the season,
the defense has accumulated an astound-
ing 22 interceptions, led by sophomore
ball-hawk Jake Pelton, who has had six.
in comparison, W&L has been intercepted
only three times.

Since the team’s turnaround, they have
won each game by an average of just over
2l'points.

This season was especially nice after
“the frustration of the last two years,”
Westfal said. He has been the starting
quarterback since his freshman year.

Next up for the team is the NCAA

‘Championship playoffs. The team is ex-

cited, but Westfal also said the idea of
competing was a “weird feeling.” The
team has always felt like they were on the
outside looking in when it came to football
on the national stage.

Junior linebacker Rob Look takes down a Tiger ball carrier during the
Parent’s Weekend match. Look recorded seven solo tackles and two
pass break-ups in the game, which lead the team is both areas.

Junior quarterback Charlie Westfal said

players began stepping up and taking more '

active roles within the team, These players
helped foster a positive team chemistry, an
internal conﬁdence that grewevery day.

Miriello said everything just began to
click. The team was no longer “young and
inexperienced,” and players were “buying
into” the system of focusing on fundamen-
tals and discipline.

“To achieve success, you have to be
disciplined and focused, and that requires
maturity,” Miriello said. The team was
getting better and playing better every
week as a result.

And they have not tasted defeat since.

The defense took slightly longer to
mature than the offense, but they still
managed to keep all but one game from

“lt’s hard to get a gauge of where [the
team] stands compared to other teams na-
tionally,” Westfal said. “All the team can

’ do is play the way we’ve been playing.”

Miriello hopes that Saturday’s win will
give the team momentum heading into the
Championship games. .

And players are optimistic for the fu-
ture of the program.

“This season is by no means a ﬂuke,
and we plan to continue building upon our
success this year,” said Murray. The team
wants to “really give the fans something to
get excited about [for the] future.”

The team’s Cinderella story will con-
tinue next Saturday as they face Thomas
More in Kentucky at 12 p.m.
