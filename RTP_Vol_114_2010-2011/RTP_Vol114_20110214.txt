Students turned out in droves to com-
pete in last Sunday’s dodgeball tourna-
ment and to show their support for their
classmates, Natalie Stier and Kevin
Dyer. The event raised over $2000 each
for the Stier and Dyer family to help pay
medical bills that resulted from the car
accident in December.

Before the teams hit the court to
unleash their completive spirit, Doug
Bealle and Sarah Monte, the event or-
ganizers, presented Dyer and Stier with
ceremonial super-sized $2000 checks.
But with t-shirt sales and donations yet
to be ﬁnalized, they said the ﬁnal amount
would deﬁnitely be higher.

Sixteen teams entered the competi-
tion, but only one could win could win
the tournament and Fancy Dress tickets
for the entire squad. The rounds in-

Wells appointed to Executive Commi

volved some impressive evasive maneu-
vers and more than a few painful look-
ing smacks of ball hitting skin.

if the ofﬁcials decided a match was
running too long, they would abolish
the boundary lines, allowing a mad dash
free-for-all as the remaining players
chased each other down.

Both Stier’s track and ﬁeld team-
mates and Dyer’s Phi Kappa Sigma
brothers battled their way through the
bracket to the ﬁnal match, and after a
close championship game, the track run-
ners ﬁnished ﬁrst.

Marissa Thompson, who helped or-
ganize the track team, said it was a great
bonding experience for a team that has
been missing its captain since the De-
cember accident.

After the accident, which involved

ﬁve Washington and Lee students, both
Stier and Dyer were in critical condi-
tion. They each remained in the hospital
for over a month.

But both have made stunning prog-
ress and they continue to improve with
physical therapy. Stier is expected to
make a full recovery.

Although Dyer is currently conﬁned
to a wheelchair, his outlook on life re-
mains resiliently positive.

“Since my accident, I have come to
realize that it is true that 10% of life is
what happens to you, and 90% is how
you deal with it,” reads one of his jour-
nal entries on Caringbridge.com, a site
that connects patients to their friends
and family.

The W&L community also needed to
recover after the accident. Bealle said

STUDENTS AND FOR THE STUDENTS SINCE 1897

the idea for the tournament came to him
over winter break because so many peo-
ple were asking how they could help.

He said the event was as much about
helping out the Dyer and Stier families
as it was about the student body coming
together to support their injured friends.
He called the event a “cathartic experi-
ence,” and said he thanks everyone for
the outpouring of support.

When Bealle told Monte about the
idea, she said she thought it would be
a great way to help both Dyer and Sti-
er, who she said is one of her closest
friends.

Monte, Bealle and other volunteers I

went door to door in downtown Lexing-
ton asking for donations for the raffle.
They designed t-shirts, reserved the
gym and even overcame a few problems

W&L students team up to support their injured classmates

with the swipe machines.

“l’m really proud of the student
body,” said Monte after the tournament.

Stier said she was also very excited
about the number of students that par-
ticipated. “The turnout was awesome,
more than I expected,” she said.

Overall, Stier said, the tournament
was a lot of fun and that dodgeball was
a good choice because it’s a sport every-
one can play.

Stier had one other reason to smile
after the tournament. ‘‘I’m very happy
the track team won,” Stier said.

After an intensive nomination and interview process, EC appoints new junior representative to ﬁll vacant spot

By Eleanor Kennedy
NEWS EDITOR

John Wells, a junior from Columbia,
S.C., is the newest member of Washing-
ton and Lee’s Executive Committee.

Wells was appointed to the EC to
replace junior Luke Anderson, who
resigned last Tuesday for personal rea-
sons. '

When a member steps down, the Stu-
dent Body Constitution requires the EC
to ﬁll the vacancy, but does not specify
how a new member should be selected.

Although special elections have been
held in the past, the EC decided not to
do so this time.

President Scott Centorino said that
since regular elections are only a month
and a half away, the EC felt “that to ap-
point someone would be the best thing
for the class.” ‘

Centorino asked all members of the
EC to nominate juniors whom they felt
could best represent their peers. About
30 names were suggested at ﬁrst, and
that list was eventually pared down to
six.
The EC tried to be as thorough as
possible in its selection of potential
members. “We didn’t want to leave any
stone unturned,” Centorino said. '

The six nominees were invited to
interview for the position last Sunday.
One student chose not to participate
because of other commitments. The EC
conducted 25 minute interviews with
the rest of nominees in order to make
their selection.

Centorino said subjects _covered
ranged from the honor system, to the

candidate’s personal temperament to
other activities they were involved in.
Every current member was allowed to
ask questions, and Centorino said that
made for some very interesting inter-
views. L

“Everybody on the EC is looking for
something different,” Centorino said,
“but we all want the best representa-
tive.”

One area which the EC paid special
attention to was nominees’ experience
in other governing bodies. Because the
new member must immediately begin
representing his peers and ruling on
EC business, current members wanted
someone who would be prepared to take
on that level of responsibility.

Centorino said that choosing the new

member was one of the most difﬁcult
decisions he has made in his time on the
EC.

“Once we got to theinterviews, it
was clear we were going to get a great
new member,” Centorino said.

That new member is Wells, a biology
major who currently serves as treasurer
of the IFC. .

Centorino said Wells was selected
because members believe that he can
represent his class effectively while still
keeping an open mind to others’ points
of view.

“His abilities are unquestionable,"
Centorino said. “Nobody had anything
bad to say about the guy.”

Wells said. he feels honored that he
was even considered for the position.

Although he has not beeninvolved with
student government before, he said he
thinks his time on IFC will give him a
strong perspective on Greek life and stu-
dent government.

Wells said he is not sure whether he
will run for EC in the upcoming elec-
tions, but he sees this time as a great
opportunity to see if he would like to
continue representing his class.

1‘:

“I look forward to representing the A

class of 2012,” Wells said. “l'hope peo-
ple will feel comfortable coming to me
if they have any questions about the EC
or about me.”

Ben Stein “love, |ove,loves” W&L

Economist, actor, game show host, professor and author Ben Stein speaks to Generals about his priorities in life

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

“The most polite, well-mannered,and
charming people I have ever met have
come from Washington and Lee," said
author, speechwriter, presidential advi-
sor, professor, actor and economist Ben
Stein.

Last Tuesday, Stein visited W&L as a
result ofpersistent efforts by the student-
run Contact Committee. Depending on
how you look at the Columbia under-
graduate and Yale Law School gradu-
ate, Stein is mostly known for his role
in the 1986 classic Ferris Bue/[er Is Day
Oﬂ, his Comedy Central show Win Ben
Stein 3 Money, and his role as a speech-
writer to Presidents Richard ‘Nixon and
subsequently Gerald Ford. But after lis-
tening to Stein’s lecture in Lee Chapel,
W&L community members will surely
remember Stein differently.

Stein began his lecture by telling
three brief anecdotes. Before the stories,

he said, “I have to tell you some sto-
ries, or else it’s not me!”

But after the stories, Stein spent
the rest of his lecture expressing an
intense sense of gratitude for every-
thing that our country has~from his
wife to our armed forces.

“I thank God every day for wak-
ing up with my wife,” Stein said.
“Getting married to the right person
is the biggest step you take in life

and ﬁnding the right life partner is V

the most challenoin step in life.”
D A
Stein referred to his wife as
a “literal saint” numerous times

throughout his lecture. Despite all I

he has accomplished and succeeded
in throughout his life, Stein said his
family has been the most impor-
tant,‘ along with those who serve
for our country. Stein said everyone
should be grateful for our military,

our nurses and doctors, our teachers
and professors, and for our military
wives.

Stein also said that he is not con-
cerned with recent challenges that
America may face with the increas-
ing economic stability of China.

“America has always been a great
country,” said Stein. “China is four
and half times the size of the United
States. It doesn’t bother me if we
don’t stay as the world’s most indus-
trial power.”

What worries Stein the most
about China’s increasing stability is
the education system in the United
States. Stein said he is concerned that
at other universities and especially at
high schools, most students cannot
handle basic-level work. According
to Stein, many college sophomores
know less about history and English

 

than theydid in high school.

“If people don’t know history or
basic things, how will they know to be
grateful for good in America?” asked
Stein. “How will they know how much
to sacriﬁce to keep America as [glori-
ous] as it is?”

When asked by an audience mem-
ber, Stein said that he has sacriﬁced
very few things, if any, throughout his

life. He thoroughly enjoys sharing his_

accomplishments and experiences with
other educated individuals throughout
the world. I

Stein will always have the utmost re-
spect for W&L. After all, he did say, “I
love, love, love Washington and Lee.”

opinions

‘ Enjoy

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I’d like to thank Hallmark.
No, not for their channel. When
your programming makes Oxy-
gen seem masculine, WE seem
tolerable and Lifetime seem not
that melodramatic, you know
that you have the worst channel
since My9.

I’m not even a big fanof the
cards either. The Hallmark aisle
in CVS is probably the second
worst aisle in the whole store.
The worst, of course, is the femi-
nine hygiene aisle. That aisle is a
trail of tears in its own right.

But I digress: I want to thank
Hallmark for an action that has
gotten a good amount of ridicule
over the last few years: turning
Valentine’s Day into the con-
glomerated nightmare it is to-
day. I have heard many protests
against the company claiming
h'ow evil Valentine’s Day has be-
come.

I mean, the holiday origi-
nally was about an early Chris-
tian martyr who was not even
a big Cupid fan himself. How
could Hallmark turn such a holy
holiday into a movie that starred
Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift
among other horrible actors?

After doing a little bit of light
research on the subject (see:
MLA’s favorite Wikipedia), I
found out that Hallmark wasn’t
even started as a company until
the.modem view of Valentine’s
was established. Nevertheless,
they still receive others’ blame
and my praise.

See, I want to thank Hallmark
for their piece in the destruction
of American society because I ac-
tually like the modern Valentine’s
Day. The cultural phenomenon it
has developed into has been an
annual adventure for me.

After numerous failures and
successes, I think I can now say
that I have conquered Valentine’s
Day, and as a true connoisseur
of the subject, I will do my best
to defend it and advise others on
how to conquer it.

The most common case made
against the modern Valentine’s
Day is its superﬁciality. As
America seems to get more and
more focused on surface appear-
ance as a result of its heavy re-
liance on the service industry,
Americans seem threatened by
the lack of depth that the upcom-
ing youth perceive in others.

They argue that because we
no longer rely on making things
as a country, the value of what
someone does is no longer as
important as what others think
he can do or what he looks like.
Also, with an economy of excess
wealth, we have more money to
spend on these unnecessary fri-
volities that heighten our surface
appearance without us having to
better our spirit or intellectual
determination. Valentine’s Day,
these others argue, is the epitome
of this problem. We buy pieces
folded pieces of paper, terrible
tasting candies with no nutrition-
al value, buy cotton stuffed fake
animals and purchase millions of
dollars worth of shiny things for
no real reason other than satisfy-
ing our temporary wants or bet-
ting the surface appearance of
those we are close to.

While these other people
might have somewhat of a point
(mostly because I made up their
argument), why does America’s
superﬁciality seem like a new
thing and why is Valentine’s
Day seeming embrace of excess
wealth and surface appearance
so bad in its own right?

Let’s not kid ourselves;
America has been superﬁcial
since about day one. Unfortu-
nately though, back in the days —
before Valentine’s Day, it was
just called racism and it was a
much less dapper form of super-
ﬁciality. Nowadays, superﬁcial-
ity just hurts people’s feelings.
Back then, it hurt their backs. I
say we made progress.

Furthermore, if we’re go-
ing to bunch the entire country
and compare it to other coun-
tries, then it’s probably safe to
say that we do have a little too
much excess wealth. So, what’s
so bad about using that wealth to

ing Valentine’s Day at W&L@

buy stuff that makes us happy? I
know that about 100 economics
majors just scoffed loudly (I’m
looking at you, freshman room-
mate), but it’s not like we’re
investing our money into smart
decisions anyway, so why not
gratify ourselves? Every civiliza-
tion has their certain things that
they spend capital on to make
themselves look pretty, so why
should we be any different?

Okay, I even bored myself
with all that mumbo-jumbo. I
know that you just want to get
to my lead—in about fraternities.
We’re getting there. Be patient.

So, now that we know Valen-
tine’s Day isn’t evil, what’s so
good about it?

Well, there are two answers
to that question, depending on
whether or not you have a Y
chromosome.

If you do, that means you are a
male, and you have a really hard
time seeing how Valentine’s Day
is anything other than a drain on
your wallet. Look, guys, by not
embracing Valentine’s Day you
are doing terrible things to your
reproductive organs. Don’t view
Valentine’s Day as a burden, but
rather as an opportunity. For 364
days out of the year, you have to
earn affection by spending time
with girls, pretending to pay at-
tention to their problems and
getting involved in drama. How-
ever, Hallmark and a little known
martyr have given you a valuable
gift: the ability for one night to
simply purchase affection.

Okay, KEWL, chill out, I’m
not that shallow. Well, maybe
a little, but that’s not the point
I’m trying to make. See, the pur-
chased affection does not neces-
sarily need to come in the form of
money. By putting in a little time
and effort, you V eally get far
with va1en;m'é‘*§‘b ‘ “

 
 

there also get you far with
Valegitiije’s Day, so don’t neces-
sarily discount that.

What5gI’m really trying to say
is that,ﬁVaIer1tine’s Day is the day
of the year when you literally get
the best/"bang=;~..for your buck. In
that respecll‘,-dtjtii‘-narrowly edges
out Tear Night"-fo'r.—i.tl'ie..‘night of
the year when  ‘results
in high dividends in theisédidom.
For you Econ majors, theiiiagvj
opportunity cost lets you break?
down those barriers to entry cre-
ating a night of high utility.

Plus, this year, Valentine’s
Day is on a Monday. C’mon,
have you ever tried to hook up on
a Monday without chocolate or a
teddy bear to back you up? It’s
hard. Girls here are usually hav-
ing a bad case of the Mondays
and are more focused on the TV
lineup for ABC Family than on
making some bad decisions. This
is the only real opportunity you
have for a quality Monday. hook-
up the entire year and all it costs
is a dinner at the Red Hen or a
thoughtfully put together “Roses
are Red” poem. Is that really so
difﬁcult?

And for you single guys with
seemingly no one to turn to on
Valentine’s Day, this is the only
day of the year when you can
make an ass out of yourself and
actually, maybe get positive re-
sults. If you tell a girl way hotter
than you that you have loved her
for the last six months at KA’s
Resurrection party, you will
probably be greeted with a nice
little restraining order or an SJC
hearing. But if you confess that
same love to the same girl on
Valentine’s Day and accompany
it with a cute song or poem and
a glass of champagne, there’s a
chance that you might actually
get lucky. In other words, Valen-
tine’s Day is the only day where
“Eww, creepy” becomes “Aww,
cute.”

Now for the ladies, I know
that you all probably love Valen-
tine’s Day, so I don’t need to do
that much convincing. However,
there are some single ones out
there who sadly will be without a
pursuer this Valentine’s Day, and
I’m guessing that this article is
making you reach for that box of
chocolates extra fast.

_ y':“weii.; also ~ 
putting little money here ait'tl'—

 

However, even for you guys,
there is an upside to Valentine’s
Day. You have a no holds barred
excuse to throw your very own
pity party for an entire day. No
self respecting ‘girl is going to
quell the complaints of the girl
who wasn’t sent ﬂowers on Val-
entine’s Day because every girl
isjust as afraid that that might be
her next year. Normally, buying
yourself ﬂowers, teddy bears and
boatloads of chocolate would be
enough for you-r friends to have
a little intervention about the re-
lationshipbetween you and your
sanity. However, it’s Valentine’s
Day, the only day when watching
“He’s Just Not That Into You”
seven times isn’t a committable
offense!

And for you girls in relation-
ships at Washington and Lee, be
warned. Make sure you know
what you are getting into when
you celebrate Valentine’s Day
with your W&L date. Each fra-
ternity has developed their men
in very speciﬁc ways, meaning
that each fraternity will give
you a unique experience when
it comes to your Valentine’s Day
date.

Now, if your date is a GDI or
an Independent if you will, there
are a whole slew of problems
you might confront. Mostly like-
ly, your Independent date is too
busy to take you out to dinner be-
cause he’s too busy in the library,
in the church or in his own room
being lame and playing video
games. Either that, or he’s bak-
ing you such a fantastic meal and
treating you so exquisitely that
you have no   est
of this ami_<;il§', 6 let’sjust_fdr’”",

 

big brother didn’t agree with me.
Let’s be honest, if an SAE is tak-
ing you out on a Valentine’s Day
date, you are probably a Kappa.
And because you are a Kappa,
you will need to rush to dinner.
You and your date are probably
not that famous of lovers, but
I’m sure ifyou rush to dinner fast
enough, you’ll get there in ﬁve or
six snaps. Still, your shrimp and
grits dinner will be delightful,
or maybe it was steak and grits.
Who knows? The details with
what happens with SAEs at night
are always so questionable.

Kappa Alpha - Don’t try
and wiggle your way out of it,
your KA date is taking you to a
buffet for Valentine’s Day. Yeah,
he will give you tons of presents
throughout your date, so you will
be plenty entertained, but most
likely they will all come from
Walmart. As you’re explaining to
your date that bigger does not al-
ways mean better, he will notice
some ofhis pledges eating dinner
at the table next to him. You will
see his face getting red as the
pledges obviously are not study-
ing as they should be. But have
no fear, because soon the anger
will subside when he realizes
that those are just KA’s “B” team
pledges, and as you leave, he’ll
wish them luck in the Kappa Sig
house next year.

Sigma Chi — Your Sigma
Chi date will pick you up early
for your wonderful night on the
town. You will think to yourself
that Niko’s probably isn’t the
most romantic place to ‘spend a
Valentine’s Day, but he’s a little

about _Ip§iependents and"‘their‘3§s;;broke from rush. That won’t

dates folifnow. I’m just goingto

focus  the fraternities and their,‘ g H

these rankings were done using

a complicated statistical formula
based on community service and
GPA, so I’m going to trust that

Phi Delta  (‘U ike
many of the subseqiientif ater-
nities on this list, you carfmeet
your Phi Delt at his house before
going out to dinner. Yeah, he
might wear a suit and tie out to
the Bistro, but you can bet that
the tie will be loosened and the
shirt unbuttoned. Make sure that
you have candles at your table
because I’m guessing that it’s
been a while since his last show-
er. After dinner, he’ll probably
take you out partying. So, either
you’ll end up in the basement
having a Helen Keller themed
party so security doesn’t hear,
or some freshmen from a sweet
Southern prep school will pick
you and take you ﬁfteen minutes
out to a party. Your cell phone is
not needed because there’s no
service.

Phi Kappa sigma — Unless
you want to meet him at Woods
Creek, you will be picked up in
(at worst) a 5 series BMW be-
cause lax bros simply don’t put
up with Lexus. Before getting in
the car, make sure you move his
mirror into the backseat. I know
you probably wanted a group date
with some friends, but Phi Kaps
are no longer Congregationalists.
Luckily, you will not even have
to reach for the check because
he’ll be signing the bill “Trust

your group date with the armada
developing outside County Seat,
but I don’t think you’ll love the
atmosphere: they’re all too nosy.

~ they are accurate‘ and whollyyfepsfﬂiii wards to giggle with each other
‘eaaegent fraternities at this schoogg’

i

and chat about how the night’s
going. You might wonder where
their dates are though.

Pi Kappa Phi —Your dinner
will be average with your date Pi
Phi Joe, but he’ll constantly be
lamenting the fact that he’s get-
ting shut down by Globo Gym.
The night will be pretty nonde-
script for the most part. Yeah,
you’ll get chocolates, but they
will be your run of the mill Rus-
sell Stover’s. He"ll almost get
you the teddy bear that you really
wanted for Valentine’s Day, but
he won’t. Finally, after having a
pretty good night spent mostly
in shaded areas, you will head
home to whoops from his pledge
brothers. That is, until you step
into the light...

Phi Kappa Psi — Speaking
of face issues, if you are the type
of girl-who likes giving her date
useful gifts for Valentine’s Day,
why not give the gift that keeps
on giving? Proactiv. You will
not ﬁnd a date who tries harder
to impress you than a Phi Psi
on Valentine’s Day. He will pull
out all the stops, just for you.
So what if the dinner is ined-
ible and whatever-that-thing-is
that he made you himself as a
gift will soon makes its way into
the dumpster, who are you to
take away that adorable shit eat-
ing grin? Just make sure that his
busy schedule doesn’t get in the
way of your date; it would be a
major downer if he skipped an-
other date to attend KA’s'class on
social climbing.

Beta Theta Pi — You are
going to have to remind your
Beta date that it is, in fact, Val-
entine’s Day, and that means he
does, in fact, have to take you
out on a date or at least buy you J

something. Finally realizing that
you’re serious, he’ll put on his
Monday best: an NBA jersey
that shows off his...well...are
those muscles? He’ll take you to
his version of a fancy restaurant:
Taco Bell, where you’ll probably
have to pay because he “forgot
his wallet at home.” Better use
the drive-thru though, because
if you eat inside, he’ll ﬁnd some
random dude looking at you the
wrong way and haymaker him

_ for no reason whatsoever. As

he’s kicking the guy while he’s
down, you’ll leave quietly. Later
on that night, he’ll either text you
numerous times or just call you
and mumble incoherently as he
attempts for a Hail Mary booty
call.

Lambda chi Alpha — You
are going to spend most of your
time trying to ﬁnd an amply
fancy enough dress for dinner. If
you assume that he will be wear-
ing anything other than interview
attire, you will be overshadowed
in dressiness on Valentine’s Day
and guys should never be the
center of attention today. This is
your day, but since no Lambda
owns a t-shirt, he won’t get that
memo. You’ll have to pick up
your date at the freshmen dorms
because he’ll be busy advising
his resident freshmen boys --
well, the ones that are still there
on a Monday evening in Febru-
ary. The most important thing to
remember is to never mention the
fact that you voted for Obama in
2008 or like any government in-
tervention whatsoever, because
if you do, he probably won’t pay
for the check.

Phi Gamma Delta — Do
not, I repeat, do not try and pick
your Fiji date up at his house.
GPS can’t even ﬁnd that house.
Also be sure to ask refrain from
replying, “No really what fra-
ternity did you pledge?” when
he tells you how great Fiji is. I
assure you that people are mem-
bers there.,Speaking of, if you
are tired of the small school
atmosphere and feel like meet-
ing l7 people who go to school
with you who I’m sure you have
never met, try hanging out with
the Fiji pledge class before going
on your date. They’re a blast. I’m
sure you’ll get adequate gifts and
have a ﬁne dinner with your Fiji,
date, but make sure you remem-
ber his name or the whole night
will be for naught.

Pi Kappa Alpha — Expect
vast bouquets of ﬂowers from
your PiKA date. In fact, expect
a fruitful accompaniment to your
vast bouquets of ﬂowers. You
will lose track oftime over dinner
because you and your date will
be chatting for such an extended
period of time that you will not
know what happened to your din-
ner. How can he be so focused on
the conversation at hand and yet
talk so fast and excitedly for the
three to ﬁve hours you will hang
out for the night? No idea; he
must just be a tangential thinker.
He will graciously pay for the
bill even though he didn’t even
touch his salad. However, the
night will end up on somewhat
of a sour note when you reach
for his endowment, and he looks
at his watch and exclaims, “Look
at the time! I have so much work
to ﬁnish”

Chi Psi — After dinner, your
date will take you back to the Chi
Psi house for an after dinner ren-
dezvous. You will be thoroughly
surprised to discover something
you haven’t seen since Roeth1is-
berger held the Lombardi Tro-
phy: freshmen running around
the house. After you wipe your

‘eyes in disbelief, you will start

heading upstairs with your date
when one of these mysterious
freshman will ﬁnally speak up.
Yeah, it’ll be a little bit ofa tum-
off when your date has to fetch
the freshman water and then do
pushups for not doing it with a
smile, but, hey, who are you to
complain? After you get upstairs,
be careful not to make out with

your date too «loudly or a kid
down the hall will call security
on you for distracting his study-
ing. Good news for you though:
if you actually do spend the late
night at Chi Psi, hanging out up-
stairs at that hour will end the
same way as hanging out in their
basement at the hour. . .with your
pants off.

Sigma Phi Epsilon - Try to
wear ear plugs on the drive over
to dinner, because your Sig Ep
date will probably be playing his
new CD in the car. If you don’t
bring the ear plugs, make sure
you zone out, and if he asks, say
his music sounds edgy and “kind
of like a revolution of your ears,”
and he’ll be appeased enough to
pay for the check. If you want
gifts to go with the check how-
ever, you’ll probably have to do
a little more appeasing during
dinner. Just keep nodding and
smiling whenever he tells you,
“No seriously, we’re getting cool
now. Have you seen our pledge
class? Have you been to our par-
ties? They are legit now. We’re
getting hot girls here all the time,
especially freshman bitties.” Try
and avoid adding sarcastic u’s
to your “Sure,” or you won’t be
getting the earrings he got from
Jared.

Kappa Sigma — Look, I
don’t know anything about Kap-
pa Sig. You don’t know anything
about Kappa Sig. And even if we
did know anything about,Kappa
Sig, I have a feeling that they are
more random than Lady Gaga
arriving inside of an egg at the
Grammy’s. Therefore, I’m go-
ing to talk about something else:
C0llegeACB. After traveling to
the site for the ﬁrst time in a year,
let me tell you how hilariously
awful this site has become. Not
only do people still say phrases
like “when was the last time any
respectable big 3 guy attended
a KA party? NEVER” (I must
be hanging out with the wrong
people if there are people who
actually think like that), but there
are other students who somehow
only seem to ﬁnd enjoyment in
going past the school’s encryp-
tion to a blocked website just
to question the validity of the
statements made on that site.
Really? You’re going to change
someone’s degrading comment
by going onto a blocked website
and patronizingly waxing po-
etic about how you shouldn’t be
mean on an anonymous site that’s
designed for people to say mean
things? Two questions: how did
you get into this school and have
you ever tried not reading these
postings? One last thing: I rarely
like to give the administration
credit, but you have to admit they
did a pretty good job with the
whole “Jdicy Campus” situation.
It was a legitimate problem two
years ago, and now that problem
is damn near close to extinction
at W&L. You really can’t say
that their initiatives weren’t as
successful as they could possibly
be in that respect. Parents, make
sure you read that last sentence,
and administration, I will now
gladly accept my get out of jail
free card now.

Sigma Nu — Hopefully on
Tuesday, there isn’t a math or
science test. If so, you will ba-
sically have the same problems
dating a Sigma Nu on Valentine’s
Day as you do dating an indepen-
dent on Valentine’s Day (not that
you don’t without the test). Your
dinner will be fantastic... as long
as you know Elvish. That’s re-
ally where the Sigma Nu knows
his best love poetry. Don’t be
worried on the walk over to the
Bistro: just because he’s follow-
ing you at a distance of 100 feet,
doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you.
That’sjust his MO. Unlike going
on a date with a Phi Delt, you are
deﬁnitely going to need your cell
phone with your date with a SNu.
If you need a ride home the next
day, you can’t borrow his phone
to call a friend: he used all his
minutes calling the cops on par-
ties and snowball ﬁghts.

Protecting the Chesapeake Bay

Doing your part to help protect the Chesapeake Bay Watershed is imperative in preserving the area 3 natural beauty

By Jackson Buttery
C 0 L U M N IS I

To the Students, Faculty, and
Members of the Washington and
Lee University Community:

There exists neither a simple
nor singular way to save the en-
vironment.

Neither Superman nor Cap-
tain Planet will appear from the
clouds; no solution no matter
how brilliant will eradicate the
unfathomable amounts of waste
from the surface of the earth; no
magic chemical will erase the
stains of human pollution.

While saving the environ-
ment is the ultimate and most
important goal, it is also terribly
impractical. The environment is
and isn’t the world around us.
I can best deﬁne it as a series
of interconnected, various and
unique natural systems whose
roots ,can each be traced deeply
and speciﬁcally. The most prac-
tical goal, then, is to save our
environment and hope and con-
vince others to save theirs.

Our school, Washington and
Lee University, belongs to one
of the most important and largest
bio-regions in the United States,
the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

As Ned Tillman, the author
of The Chesapeake Watershed
writes:

“The Chesapeake Bay Wa-
tershed is large and diverse, col-
lecting waters that fall on parts of
six states. Rain falling on farms,
factories, and probably even on
your house,,lawn, and driveway
ﬂows along countless streams
and rivers that crisscross the
land and eventually mixes with
the saltier waters of the bay. The
water quality, biodiversity, and
health of the bay and its ﬁsher-
ies are all related to every part of

the habitat throughout this vast,
ﬁfty-million acre watershed. We
are all in this together” (91).

While many daunting issues
face the bay — including pollu-
tion, the rising level of sea water
and the declines of the popula-
tions of many native species, to
name a few — perhaps the big-
gest problem the bay must deal
with is its own reputation.

While I can not speak for the
rest of the country, for years the
only environmental rally cries I
heard (besides SAVE THE PO-
LAR BEARS! and SAVE THE
AMAZON!) were SAVE THE
BAY! and THE BAY IS DY-
ING!

As hard as it was to not hear
about the dying bay, it was just
as easy to believe that the en-
vironmentalists — who I then
imagined as scraggly ex-hippies
munching granola in some sort
ofenvironmental VW bus — were
already handling the issue.

The bay wasn’t my prob-
lem because I live in northeast
Philadelphia, far away from the
the Chesapeake Bay. My fam-
ily doesn’t even recycle. Most
nights we eat from cheap paper
plates. The Bay was at least a
couple of hours away and I had
only been there once, a long
time ago.

My brother says we went in
the water and crabbed with met-
al cages and raw chicken necks,
but all I can remember is eating
crabcakes sitting in a mostly-
wooden restaurant that was little
more than a shack.

I still haven’t been back and
the bay, for me, is a region I am
very unfamiliar with and a natu-
ral beauty that I truthfully can
not picture in my mind.

THE MEDIA BOARD

I can read books about it and
look at pictures and try to put
the pieces together but I still can
not grasp it completely. It is not
mine.

While I am not as well ac-
quainted with the landscape of
our university as well as I am
with the city grid of Philadelphia
or the trails of Pennypack Park,
I have gained a deep apprecia-
tion for the wonder this region
holds.

Upon first driving down
Interstate 81, the green roll-
ing hills and lush grass and the
mountains shading the sky in
the background brought vivid
memories ofthe summer before,
of a train ride through the tran-
quil Austrian countryside, from
Munich to Salzburg, with the
similar framing and colors ofthe
Shenandoah Valley.

There is something unde-
niably special about this area.
Maybe it’s the way the sun sets
over the Blue Ridge Mountains,
or the red brick paired with the
snow lying fresh on the ground,
or the bike trail along Woods
Creek in late fall when no one
else is around and the crisp air
cuts into your lungs but you feel
alive.

I traded skyscrapers, row-
homes and subways for Traveler
and the Colonnade and the bones
of Robert Edward Lee, and this
place is my homejust as well as
yours.

To preserve and maintain
our university and its surround-
ing environment, we -- all of us
-- must continue the “green” ef-
forts we have already began and
create others when possible, not
just practical.

The environment isn’t some

ambiguous form that can be
solved at once. It is a series of
systems and we are capable of
tracing our system to its root
and beginning our undertaking
there. While helping to clean the
Chesapeake Bay is the recogniz-
able opposite-endpoint of our
route, we are not going to save
the Chesapeake Bay by setting
out to do exactly that.

We are too small and too few
to accomplish such a feat. But our
area of Virginia is a part of the
Bay Watershed, and Rockbridge
County is a part ofthis Virginian
area, and this university is a part
of Rockbridge County, and each
member of this university com-
munity is a part ofthis university
and it is there that we must start
cleaning the bay: with each of
our individual efforts.

Our minute efforts arejointly
ampliﬁed just like a single rain-
drop or a single drop of acid
dropped into our little Woods
Creek will eventually ﬂow into
the Maury River, which will
eventually flow into the James,
which will eventually flow into
the Chesapeake itself.

. The university is already do-
ing its part: installing energy-ef-
ﬁcient light bulbs, keeping the
temperature in student dormito-
ries at moderate levels so as to
conserve energy, working with
local food sellers to distance
itself. from chemicals and the
inhumane treatment of animals,
using recycled paper cups and
offering the option of re—usable
to-go trays at all meals and reno-
vating each building ofthe icon-
ic Colonnade to make it more
energy-efﬁcient.

But our university’s efforts
should reflect our individual at-

totheetilior

Respected Editor,

1 am writing to you today
to take issue with a piece pub-
lished in the February 8, 2011 is-
sue of the Ring-Tum Phi. When
ﬂipping through this paper the
other evening, I, as well as those
around me, was appalled by the
article entitled “Take me out to-
night to a frat party”.

After reading the dismissive
and generalizing statements
written with a condescending
tone, I could not decide whether
to laugh or cry. The way that this
columnist portrayed freshmen
girls at W&L was diﬂicult to
read—after all of the initiatives
to change the way that women
in our community are treated,
things like this are a big step
in the wrong direction. The use
of .valley girl-isms like “totes
adorbs”, discussion of trying to
“DFM” and looking “‘edgy-’ but
not slutty” is simply embarrass-
ing. I can speak for most of the
population in saying that I love
some quality satire, but this
was just distasteful arid tactless.
W&L girls are more than willing
to poke fun at themselves,’ but

this article was demeaning in a
way that crossed many a bound-
ary.
My feelings about this ar-
ticle aside, I think in the future
it is imperative to consider the
circulation of this newspaper.
I am never one for censorship,
but were I to pick up a copy of
the Phi as a prospective student
in the admissions ofﬁce, this ar-
ticle alone would have deterred
me from applying to Washington
and Lee. With W&L’s desires to
retain tradition while diversify-
ing its population, how does it
look to have a female member
of the community deriding her
peers like this? It makes this
place seem unwelcoming and
shallow, which I don’t believe

_ it is.

I look forward to quality
journalism in the future~—speak
your mind, opinion writers, but
consider your audience as well.

Sincerely,
Noel Price

titudes and work towards better-
ing the environment: we must
begin with ourselves.

Simple acts that may have
been previously seen as mean-

ingless inconveniences can
eventually change the health of
the bay.

To “restore the bay’s water
quality and fisheries,” Tillman
writes that “individuals...can
replace aging septic systems
with new nitrogen-reducing sys-
tems. Garbage disposals in our
sinks should not be ‘used at all.
Nor should we dump medicines
or pharmaceuticals down the
drains” (68).

To ﬁx “erosion, siltation, and
legacy sediments,” we should
“start learning more about natu-
ral processes and how our every-
day activities affect the water-
ways and the bay. Right in our
back yards we can begin shifting
focus ﬁ‘om encouraging water to
run off our land and instead en-
courage it to ﬁlter into the soil”
(25).

To combat “sea level rise”
we “can help immediately by
changing our wasteful energy
practices; We can stop buying
things we don’t need, because
it takes energy to create, dis-
tribute, maintain, and dispose of
things. Each of us can also help
create and articulate a vision of
a healthier earth to our friends,
families, and representatives. If
people lead, politicians will fol-
low” (I3-I4).

These suggestions are good
places to start, for we must start
somewhere.

Every member of this com-
munity has the potential to be-
come an environmentalist.

It’s not left-wing to be an

it



   

Being previously lost for a
(topic for‘ this week, I was actu-
fgally slightly relieved to receive
,§an email from our “respected
'f'editor” (Stockton was also ex-
{tremely pleased to be respected
‘(for once in his life) giving me
}-something to respond to.

3? First, I would like to thank

,,,the reader for reading my article.
zgsecond, I would like to thank the
Ereader for having an opinion of
Eher own; I appreciate construc-
lfitive criticism and understand that‘
fiputting my name on something
 asking for it to be published
 opening the door for potential
ijdisagreement.

 I want to be clear that my in-
iitent has always been, and will

  

’ ""always be, to playfully poke fun

at this uniform we seem to have
on this campus. Malicious is not
a word that comes into my vo-
cabulary and I have never, ever,
targeted an individual. Except
for Stockton. And he deserves
it.

The outﬁt I described in
“Take me out to a frat party” was
the exact same one that I wore
to the White Panda/Ghostland
Observatory concert (except my
going-out boots are Cole Haan,
which is even worse). I was that

environmentalist; it’s not right-
wing. It’s not the hip thing to
do, it’s not a bunch of ex Dead
Heads, it’s not wrong and it is
not some hobby.

It is a duty that each of us
owes the earth.

It is a justified and rightful
cause that rests in not only bet-
tering the world but bettering
ourselves.

We are not going to save the
Chesapeake alone. But it’s not
only about saving the Chesa-
peake. It’s about starting small,
with ourselves, and nurturing
the root of a thick and compli-
cated system of environments,
eco-systems and bio-regions.

It’s because Rockbridge
County is an environment that
depends on the well-being of the
Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

Because if we don’t start
somewhere, if we as individuals
and parts of a larger group allow
the Chesapeake to die, then what
else but the same fate can we ex-
pect for our university?

If we lose the Chesapeake, if
it becomes more over-polluted
and overrun and undesirable and
unﬁt for natural species, if we
allow these things to pass, the
university we love will never be
the same.

I am the topic. I am my
audience. So if I can take
being “demean[ed]” and
“embarrass[ed]” in a “conde-
scending” tone that was “appall-
ing,” “distasteﬁil,” “tactless,”
“unwelcoming” and “shallow,”
then I should hope that everyone
could be in on the joke as well.

I sincerely apologize if any-
one else was offended by what
has been published in any of
my previous articles. But at the
same time, this is the opinions
section of a school newspaper,
one to which anyone is encour-
aged to contribute. So I ask, why
so serious?

Trust me whenlsay that] can

handle it when someone criti- ‘

cizes my clearly Pulitzer-worthy
“quality journalism”. However,
I do not believe thatquestioning
someone’s character is the cor-
rect approach in bringing about
this criticism.

Organization hosts talent show to raise money and awareness for displaced victims of violence and revolution

By Collins Rice
STAFF warren

Every year, the members of
the Student Association for Inter-
national Learning (SAIL) focus
on raising awareness on campus
about a particular country in
need. This year, the organization,
which addresses international is-
sues and promotes exchanges
between diverse cultures repre-
sented at Washington and Lee,
has chosen to shed light upon the
violence in Kyrgyzstan.

On Friday, March 4, the club‘

will present its Showcase for
Kyrgyzstan, a fund-raising event

in the form of a talent show.

“We invite students from the
university to perform and com-
pete with their talents,” said
Bermet Zhumakadyr kyzy, the
event’s organizer.

In the two decades since
the breakup of the former So-
viet Union, the small central
Asian country of Kyrgyzstan
has struggled to attain political
stability. Despite showing signs
of development in the form of
civil society and a free press, the

Akayev was deposed amid accu-
sations of corruption, nepotism
and authoritarianism.

Unfortunately, Akayev’s
successor, Kurmanbek Baki-

prosperity. Under Bakiyev, the
government was again subject to
opposition for its abuses of hu-
man rights including censorship
within the press and ﬁxing of
elections.

revolution in the nation’s capital,
Bishkek. The event left 85 peo-
ple dead, the capital was looted
and Bakiyev was removed from
power. The country fell into so-
cial chaos and the violence in the
city spread into southern Kyr-
gyzstan in the form of inter-eth-
nic clashes.

Currently, the death toll re-

ber is over 400, but many claim

Senior Night ends withvictory  

T he ﬁnal home game for two W&L seniors closes with a 67-58 win over conference rival Randolph-Macon

By Mike Decembrino
STAFF WRITER

The ﬁnal home game for Washington
and Lee seniors Allie Long and Felice
Herman could not have turned out any
better as the Generals women’s basket-
ball team snapped the Randolph-Macon
College Yellow Jackets’ 12-game win
streak with a 67-58 victory on Tuesday
evening at the Warner Center.

Long and Herman were honored be-
fore the game for “Senior Night,” which
recognized thetremendous four year ca-
reers of both players.

Long and junior forward Becca
Bolton led the attack for the Generals.
Bolton scored 26 points, going 7-for-
l0 from the ﬁeld and connecting on all
12 of her free throws. Long played the
entire 40 minutes for the Generals and
keyed a 21-4 game winning second half
run in which she knocked down three 3-

pointers to ﬁnish with 13 points.

Earlier this year, W&L lost to ﬁrst
place Randolph-Macon on the road 72-
55. That, combined with the Jackets’
12-game winning streak and the Gen-
erals’ two game losing streak heading
into this game, would lead many to pick
R-MC as the favorite for this contest.
W&L Head Coach Mandy King thought
otherwise.

“We really didn’t pay attention to
their winning streak or our losing streak.
We just focused on what we had to do

for these 40 minutes,” King said. “We '

actually had a lot of conﬁdence [heading
into this game]. We had a great practice
yesterday and we were just excited for
the opportunity today.”

After Maggie Roy of the Jackets
scored the game’s ﬁrst ﬁeld goal two

seconds into the game, W&L went on a
6-0 run keyed by Bolton. The Generals
held onto the lead until Jordan Cantrell
of R-MC hit a 3-pointer in the comer
with 6:56 to play in the ﬁrst half to bring
the score to a 16-16 tie. -
Down by two points with 30 seconds
to play in the ﬁrst half, Bolton connect-
ed on a short-range jump shot to tie the
score at 26 going into half time. Bolton
went 6-for-6 from the ﬁeld in the ﬁrst

' half.

“I thought we were terriﬁc on the
defensive side of the ball,” King said of
the Generals ﬁrst half defensive perfor-
mance. They held R-MC’s top scorer,
Maggie Roy, to only two points and
blocked six shots in the ﬁrst half. Three
of those blocks came from sophomore
Rachel Warrick. »

Trailing 35-33 with 15:38 to play
in the second half, Long hit a 3-pointer
to make the score 36-35 in favor of the
Generals. This began the 21-4 run that
buried the Jackets. Long made two
more consecutive 3’s and junior guard
Meg Ingram added another to cap off
the run.

At the end of this run, the Generals
led 54-39 and never looked back. R-
MC made a push in the ﬁnal six minutes
thanks to the sharpshooting of Roy, but
it was not enough as the Generals held
on fortthe 67-58 win.

King was happy with the defense in
the second half as well. “We knew we
needed to maintain the pressure against
them and keep them from scoring points
in transition,” she said. The Generals
did just that, as they held the Jackets to

just 27.1% shooting from the ﬁeld.
Ingram scored 12 points and picked

up seven rebounds while sophomore,

Katy Wilson led the team with nine re-
bounds. The Generals shot 42% from
the ﬁeld, just above their season mark of
40.6%. - V
The win improves the Generals’ re-
cord to 14-7 overall and 10-6 in Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference play. They
have won seven of their last ten games
and are on track to make the ODAC
Conference Tournament to try to repeat
as champions. The Generals ﬁnish off

the regular season with a four game road ‘

trip beginning on February 11 at Guil-
ford College.

Last second free-throws give Eagles a one-point win over Generals in W&L is last home game of the season

By Gage Smith
/STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s bas-
ketball lost a heartbreaker Saturday as
Bridgewater defeated the Generals 65-
64.

The Generals, who were up by as
many as 8 and led 27-22 going into the
half, played a strong defensive game,
but chose poor shots throughout .the
game. Both teams played a messy ﬁrst
half, each making less than 30% of their
ﬁeld goal attempts.

First-year Drew Kimberly had the V ,

ﬁrst score of the game on a free throw,
putting the Generals up 1-0 30 seconds
into the game. Bridgewater answered a

minute later, as Rick Maloney hit a la-
yup to give the Eagles their ﬁrst 2 points
of the half. '

With sloppy play as the most promi-

nent factor of the ﬁrst half, neither team
seemed to be able to make an impact on
the court. The Eagles shot 60% from the
free throw line, while the Generals shot
50%. Both teams struggled from outside
the arch, with Bridgewater shooting fail-
ing to make a single 3-pointer.
Generals sophomore Jeremy Atkins
lead the team in the ﬁrst half with 12
points, and Bridgewater senior Maloney
added 9 points for the Eagles.

The Generals entered the second
half up by 5, but the game soon became
more heated as the Eagles scored 5 un-
answered points in the ﬁrst 4 minutes to
bring them within 2 points of the lead.

By the halfway mark of the second
half, Bridgewater had cut W&L’s lead to
one, and took the lead 47-46 on another
layup by Maloney.

From there the game was a back-
and-forth battle between the two teams.
Bridgewater lead by as many as 7 with
3:28 left in the second half, and for a

I moment it looked at if the Generals were

about to give up without a ﬁght.

W&L didn’t quit, however, and
scored 7 unanswered points to tie the
game up 60-60 on a layup from Kim-
berly assisted by sophomore JD Ey with
just under 2 minutes left in the game.

The Generals suffered a setback as

‘Bridgewater senior Kyle Hammond hit

a triple with just over one minute left
in the game, but scored 4 unanswered
thanks to ajumper by Atkins after Kim-
berly stole the ball with 27 seconds left.

The ﬁnal shots in the game came on
two three throws made by Hammond
after being fouled by W&L junior Kyle
Bond, which brought the Eaglesup 65-

64 with 13 seconds left. The Generals
inbounded the ball, but were unable to
score on a missed jumper by Atkins with
2 seconds left. -

The Generals were unable to beat out
Bridgewater on‘ what was senior Jason
Cimino’s last home game. Having lost
5 of their last 6 games, W&L will take
on Hampden-Sydney away at 7 pm on
February 14.

‘team fell to the Apprentice School Build-
ers 36-9 in an away match Saturday af-
ternoon. Twelve of Apprentice School’s
points were attributed to a W&L, and
the Generals could not overcome this
‘ disadvantage.
W&L ﬁrst-year Eric Fessel put the

ﬁrst points on the board for the Generals.
Following a forfeit at 125 pounds and an
uncontested match at 133 pounds, the

the Builders pinned at 157 pounds and
Ricky Anderson for the Builders was
able to pin his opponent after only 52
seconds at 165 pounds. "

Men’s lacrosse preview

An in-depth look at the upcoming season for this year ’s Generals

By Justin Donati
STA FF w R lTE R

The 2011 W&L men’s lacrosse
program looks to rebound this year
after a disappointing 2010 season
(1 1-6 overall). Despite being left
out of pre-season Top 25 polls, ﬁfth
year head coach Gene McCabe be-
lieves that his 2011 squad has all
the necessary tools and talent to
achieve its goal of returning to the
NCAA tournament. F

Looking ahead, the team will
undoubtedly face some challenges
along the way. The most discern-
able roadblock is their schedule.
In addition to the teams difﬁcult.in
conference schedule, the Generals
will continue to face top ranked
powers such as Middlebury, and
Ohio Wesleyan. McCabe has also
arranged match-ups against two
new Top 25 teams, Salisbury and
Denison.

McCabe admitted that “this
year’s schedule will prove the ulti-
matetest of skill and talent for my
men.” However, McCabe is quick
to say that every team has to make
choices about how they perceive
challenges and adversity. In his
opinion, “to be the best you have
to play the best,” he
said.

onship team, when multiple play-
ers have the potential to ﬁnish the
season in the double-digit points
category,” said McCabe.

On the other side of the ball, the
defense continues to remain a sta-
ple of the Washington and Lee pro-
gram. Last year, the defense con-
ceded only 6.71 goals per game.

Although the defense has im-
proved year after year statistically,
Coach McCabe still sees room for

improvement. From his "observa-

tions, “the defense has been very
strong statistically, but collectively
the group struggles to hold the top
teams under 10 goals per game.”
In large part, McCabe recognizes
that overall team defense, which
includes midﬁelders, must im-
prove in order to prevail in the big
games.

The loss of two-year defensive
coordinator Jason Archbell ap-
peared troublesome for the defense
earlier this fall as the group looked
for leader to ﬁll his void. How-
ever, McCabe said, ‘‘I have been
impressed so far with the work
accomplished by Michael Kruger

experience with the Generals, he
will undoubtedly have to improve
the team’s extra man offense from
last year. As a special teams group
in 2009, the W&L men’s team
posted a national best 51 percent
conversion ratio. However, last
year that number fell to roughly 31
percent on the season. A

The coaching staff attributed
this decline in efﬁciency last year
to new personnel and a lack of
chemistry between the players on
the man-up unit. On the contrary,
they see this year group as much
more experienced and cohesive.

“For the most part, last years
unit remains intact, minus Will
Kiegler,” McCabe said.

Another part of their game that
the team will have to improve on is
its ability to successfully clear the
ball. McCabe asserted, “our clear-
ing percentage was not where we
wanted it to be last year.” In fact,
the team only managed to success-
fully clear the ball out of its defen-
sive half at a rate of 75 percent in
2010. ’

The team’s adjustments to its
, stick-work pro-

grams during the

Beyond the dif-
ﬁculty of this year’s
schedule, the Gen-
erals also face the
task of replacing
nine graduated se-
niors. The big-
gest setback comes
from the loss of Will
Kiegler, who posted
212 points for the
Generals over his
career. To replicate
the offensive production provided
by Kiegler and other graduates, the
players and coaching staff have ap-
proached this year with increased
testing standards that have forced
each player hone their skills and
become more rounded players.

The coaching staff has also re-
vamped some of its offensive and ,
defensive tactics to align with the
team’s renovated roster and abili-
ties. With this new approach in
place, McCabe recognizes that
the team has grown by leaps and
bounds from the end of last year.

Already in pre-season practices,
the team has demonstrated a more
balanced offensive attack then it
had in previous years. At the helm
are “a core group of four to ﬁve at-
tackmen and around six midﬁelders
that are regularly‘ producing scor-
ing opportunities on the offensive
side of the ball,” said McCabe.

In previous years the Generals
relied on one or two players to win;
however, this year’s“ squad is ﬁnd-
ing increased production from all
over the ﬁeld.

“This is the mark of a champi-

strengths ”

  
 

“If you look at the way we played the Lee Jackson
game this fall, and the way we dominated on the
defensive end of the ﬁeld, I feel confident saying

that our defense will again be one of our team 3

GENE McCABE, headcoach

who took over the reins following
Archbell’s departure.”

McCabe went on to explain that
“Kruger’s addition of new defen-
sive schemes, and his focus on
teaching better defensive mechan-
ics has already proven invaluable

to keeping the defense on track to‘

become a nationally ranked unit.”

“If you look at the way we
played the Lee Jackson game this
fall, and the way we dominated on
the defensive end of the ﬁeld, I feel
conﬁdent saying that our defense
will again be one of our team’s
strengths,” said the Generals’ head
coach. _

Nat Saint Laurent also returns
to the Generals’ coaching staff this
year. As a member of the coaching
staff during the 2009 championship
season, Saint Laurent knows what
it takes to win. Now heading what
looks to be a new and rejuvenated
offense, “Coach Saint Laurent’s
continuity and familiarity with the
Generals is perfectly suited to this
year’s players and program,” said
McCabe.

Even with Coach Saint Laurent’s

  /as  

off-season targeted
this exact vulner-
ability. Now with
increased stick-han-
dling ability from
the defense down
to the attack, “as
a coaching staff, I
don’t think we have
any glaring weak-
nesses, but we need
to prove that on the
ﬁeld” said the ﬁfth-
year head coach.

With all of the modiﬁcations
made to the team during the off-
season, the biggest unknown head-
ing into 2011 remains the starting-
goalie position. After graduating
starting goalies in back,-to-back
years, the team must ﬁnd a man ca-
pable of commanding the defense,
and quickly dishing the ball to
midﬁelders who have been trained
to push transition opportunities.

McCabe has four players con-

tending for the starting role at

goalie. Two are veteran seniors that
have both seen time between the
pipes. Regardless of who takes the
starting nod, with a strong defense
behind them, McCabe feels conﬁ-
dent that whoever wins the job will
have an outstanding season.

Now the real question that re-
mains to be seen is whether or not
the Generals will get off to a hot
start in the beginning of their sea-
son. Playing three of its ﬁrst four
games against teams that were in
the NCAA tournament last year,
the Generals must come out of this
ﬁrst stretch rather unblemished if it

hopes to keep alive any dream
of reaching the Division III
playoffs.
The team begins its season
on Tuesday, February 15, as it
' takes on Ferrum College (5:00
PM) on Wilson Field. Fans
are strongly encouraged to at-
tend the game, as it marks the
ﬁrst time in national lacrosse
history that a men’s team will
sponsor the Green Dot Pro-
gram, an initiative that trains
individuals how to look for
and prevent sexual assault and
misconduct.
