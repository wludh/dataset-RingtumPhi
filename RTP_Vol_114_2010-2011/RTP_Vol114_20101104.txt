Housing
pitfalls

Dealing with bags, bats and
bad landlords .

By Courtney Ridenhour
STAFF WRITER

lt’s that time of year again. The leaves are falling,
Barbour jackets are making a return to campus and
leases are being signed.

After the security deposit is in, all that’s left to
do is name the place and answer the all-important
question of where the beer pong table will go. But
the joys of leasing a fabulous off-campus house can
be cut short by the discovery of bugs. Or, in the case
of junior Grace Cushman, bats. '

Cushman and her four housemates had just set-
tled into their off-campus house when they received
the unsettling news.

“We had bats in our attic that we didn’t know
about when we ﬁrst signed the lease,” Cushman
said.

The group had to pay for an exterminator and_

evacuate the house for a week while it was fumi-
gated. Because the bats had been a problem before
the group moved in, the ﬁve students thought the
landlord should help pay for the exterminator. The
landlord disagreed.

“For the most part, we were pretty upset with our
landlord,” Cushman said. “We felt he may have tak-
en advantage of the fact that we had never lived in a
house before without our parents and had absolutely
no idea what we should pay for as tenants.”

“For students looking at housing:
don ’t stress and don ’t feel obli-
gated to sign a lease if you think...

repairs need to be done. ’

Danielle Bowman, senior

‘ Other students have also run into issues with their
landlords. Senior Danielle Bowman said her land-
lord has been unresponsive to repair requests.

“The problem is that she doesn’t own the house,
someone else does. And for anything to get done, we
have to wait until they’ve communicated. Getting
something done takes a lot longer,” she said.

The problem for many ﬁrst-time renters is that
they don’t know what to look for when they are
looking for a place. But Washington and Lee hasn’t
left students to completely fend for themselves.

lnforrnation on renters’ rights and a guide to off-
campus housing are available on the Washington and
Lee website under Residential Life. The 28-page
guide includes a list of local real estate agencies and
a Home Condition Checklist. ‘I

Despite these resources, when renters do run
into trouble with landlords, W&L has “no legal
recourse,” Dean of Student Affairs Dawn Watkins
said. According to Watkins, signing a lease is a deal
between two private citizens and the school cannot
intervene.

If major problems occur, renters can submit a
written request for an inspection to the Rockbridge
County Building Department.

“There is no charge,” Rockbridge County Build-
ing Official Erich Schnetzler said. Depending on
the severity of the infraction, landlords are given
anywhere from one week to 30 days to remedy the
problem. .

The request can only be made by current tenants.
Students searching for a house need to be careful
and vigilant. ,

“The nuance that students have to understand is
what they’re buying,” said Watkins said.

Bowman said she learned some important les-
sons from her housing experience.

“For students looking at housing: don’t stress and
don’t feel obligated to sign a lease if you think some-
thing like repairs need to be done,” she said. “I felt
pressured because we sign leases so early. 1 pretty
much settled for the first house I saw.”

Cushman also offered advice for those in the
house-hunting process. “Know your landlord’s
reputation before you sign the lease, and make sure
you’re both aware of the expectations,” she said.

“Every house has its little issues and weird
tweaks, and having a heads-up about them before-
hand would have saved us a lot of time.”

VOLUME CXIV,

Washington and Lee is capital campaign seeks to raise $500 million in seven years

By Paige Gance
STAFF w RITER -
Washington and Lee University’s

capital campaign, “Honor Our Past,
Build Our Future,” launched into its
public phase with the announcement
ofa $500 million goal.

This goal was revealed at a kick-
off celebration on Oct. 22, with 350
trustees, donors and friends of the
university in attendance. The quiet
phase began on July 1, 2008. The
entire campaign will last seven years
and end on June 30, 2015.

The campaign goal is one of the
highest ever set by a liberal arts col-
lege. It doubles W&L’s last cam-
paign, “For the Rising Generation,”
which totaled almost $243 million
and ended in Dec. 2003.

Donations thus far total $310 mil-
lion and include Rupert H. Johnson’s
gift of $100 million and Gerry Len-
fest’s gift of $50 million.

According to Vice President of
University Advancement Dennis
Cross, early progress is encouraging.
The campaign has raised 62 percent
of its goal, more than the 40-60 per-
cent Cross said a quiet phase of a
campaign should raise.

“Our goal is aggressive, but
reachable,” said Cross. “We have
great conﬁdence in our abilities to
meet it.”

The campaign breaks the total
goal into ﬁve main categories, with
the ﬁrst four adhering closely to the

  

  
   
 

‘ii

 
  

University’s 10-year Strategic Plan
developed in 2007. These include
student recruitment, faculty and staff,
campus improvement and academic
programs. The last category is grow-
ing the annual fund, which isnot part
of the Strategic Plan but still vital for
the University’s ﬁnancial ﬂexibility.

Cross describes the priorities of
this campaign as more broad based
than the last one. He said the differ-
ence is like that between a riﬂe and
a shotgun.

According to Cross, the ﬁnal goal
amount is based on a compromise
between the estimated cost of the
Strategic Plan and an evaluation of
potential donors’ abilities to give.

“It allowed us to think of what are
the highest priorities of the Strategic
Plan,” said Cross. The difference be-
tween the cost of the Strategic Plan
and the campaign goal is an extra
$100 million. Cross said that reallo-
cation of funds, tuition revenue, and
loans could cover this gap.

The estimated goal began more
modestly, only $400-450 million.
Cross recalled a meeting of the cam-
paign cabinet in New York City in
Nov, 2008, right as the economic
downturn intensiﬁed.

“Things seemed bleak,” said
Cross. They continued their plan
however, and as the quiet phase pro-
gressed, “it became clear that 400

was too small, we could go higher.”

Campaign Co-Chair Phil Norman
said that a signiﬁcant portion of the
goal has already been invested in the
ﬁrst two priorities because of John-
son and Lenfest’s gifts.

Since the Johnson Scholarship
program was announced, the number
of applicants to W&L has increased
from 3,700 to 6,200. The gift also
established a lecture series, opportu-
nity grants and two new professor-
ships.

“We want to bring in students
from all over the country and the
world so that we have a more diverse
environment for students to learn in,
that is more reflective of the world
in which they will spend the rest of
their lives,” said Norman.

The gift from Lenfest focused
more on recruiting and retaining
exceptional faculty. According to
Cross, the salaries of W&L profes-

sors are 10 percent lower than those

at peer institutions.

Funds from Lenfest will be used
to improve professor salaries as well
as to support research, sabbaticals,
visiting scholars and faculty initia-
tives in emerging areas such as envi-
ronmental science and entrepreneur-
ship.

“We want to keep our great teach-
ers active scholars,” said Cross. V

Of the remaining goal, $120.5

aignijellofc

° $160m for student recruitment

° $122m for faculty and staff

° $120.5m for facilities

° $37.5m for academic programs

- ALSO: growing annual fund $60m

million will support campus im-
provements such as the Colonnade
renovation and a new indoor athletic
facility. Academic programs like
Spring Term and internships will re-
ceive $37.5 million. The campaign
will also increase the annual fund to
$9 million per year.

While these investments will im-
prove many facets of the University,
Campaign Co-Chair Warren Ste-
phens said that W&L will stay true
to its traditions and core academic
offerings.

“I think any major change in the
way Washington and Lee educated
young people would be ﬁercely re-
sisted by the board and by every con-
stituency we could possible think of.
We’re not looking to make wholesale
changes in how we operate,” said
Stephens.

As the public phase of the cam-
paign moves forward, the cabinet
will focus on matching donor inter-
ests to particular priorities, Cross
said. Rector J. Donald Childress is
conﬁdent that the Board of Trustees
and Campaign Cabinet will be able
to inspire gifts to the University.

“More than any other college or
university with which 1 am familiar,”
said the Rector, “those who come in
contact with this University develop
a relationship that is both intense and
indelible.”

 

This is a campaign of meaning and renewal. It is about our core mission

and its relevance to a very challenging future for Washington and Lee and
its students. And it is ambitious and historic. It will be noticed not only for
its reach but also for the priorities we have established within it. It says
something about this university.’ It also says something about the leadership
role we will assume in shaping the future of the liberal arts.’:*,‘;;e‘t-ii-,i‘i"

dary anchor speaks at W&L

Former CBS anchor Dan Rather delivers the keynote address at the 5 0th Institution on Ethics in Journalism

By Becky Mickel
STAFF WRITER

Speaking to a crowd of over
300 on Friday at Washington
and Lee University, former CBS
managing editor and anchor Dan
Rather compared passionate
journalism to the patriotic sacri-
ﬁce of soldiers ﬁghting overseas
to protect our country.

Rather’s speech, titled “The
Crisis in Journalism and Why
We Should Care,” was the key-
note address of the university’s
50th Institute on Ethics in Jour-
nalism. In addition to attending
Rather’s speech, W&L joumal-
ism students spent the weekend
discussing ethical issues with
journalism fellows from media
outlets around the country and
with Rather himself.

Although his speech was at
times very critical of the process
of news-gathering today, Rather

repeatedly including himself
when he spoke about the mis-
takes reporters often make.

Rather said that one of the
biggest, problems in journalism
today is the tendency of report-
ers to accept obviously “spun”
answers from authority ﬁgures
without asking needed follow-up
questions. i

According to Rather, journal-‘
ists have a patriotic duty to ask
the tough questions and to pre-
vent the crisis that stems from
insuﬁicient reporting. Because
journalists’ actions and inactions
can have just as much signiﬁ-
cance as the men and women in
uniform, reporters owe it to the
public to report the facts and to
protect democracy, said Rather.

In addition to shoddy report-
ing, Rather said conglomeration

and increasing entertainment
media has created a crisis for
journalists and the public.

“The news has become cor-
poratized, politicized and trivial-
ized,” said Rather. According to
Rather, news is now a byproduct
of international conglomerates,
safe thoughts and even safer re-
porting. ‘

Rather said that journalism is
crucial to democracy because it
allows America to remain a fact-
gathering society.

According to Rather, if jour-
nalism is to be rescued from the
“entertainment crisis,” the public
must educate themselves prior
to elections and news resources
must be available to the public.

Rather emphasized that free-
dom of the press is essential to
democracy, which is why it is

protected in the Constitution. He
did, however, distinguish free-
dom of the press from freedom
of the media. According to Rath-
er, entertainment media is not
protected at the same level as the
press because media is not news.

Although all forms of media
may not be protected, Rather
stressed the importance of de-
fending freedom of the press as
well as the importance of solid,
reliable well-researched news.

“[News is] for us, for Amer-
ica and for the freedom of the
ﬂag for which we stand,” said
Rather.

Payne Hall closed for renovation

Payne Hall, home of the W&L English department, is the next step in the Colonnade renovation project

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

As any student or faculty
member passing by the Colon-
nade may have noticed, the next
phase of the Colonnade preser-
vation and rehabilitation project
is underway. Phase 2B, the reno-
vation of Payne Hall, began in
late September.

Payne Hall is the home of the
Washington and Lee English De-
partment. Now that work on the
building has begun, the olﬁces of
the English Department profes-
sors have been temporarily relo-
cated to Baker Hall. The work
on Payne will be completed by
early August 2011, giving the
members of the department time
to get settled back into the build-
ing before classes start up again.

According to the university’s
Director of Design & Construc-
tion, Tom Kalasky, work will be
performed over the next year on
both the interior and exterior of

the building. Kalasky said that
the exterior of the building will
be “renewed and freshened” but
not changed in any major way.

The interior of the building is
another story.

New mechanical and electron-
ic systems will be installed on
the inside of Payne Hall, includ-
ing new ﬁre alarm and sprinkler
systems. Central air condition-
ing will replace the individual
air conditioning units that used
to jut out from almost all of the
windows of the building. The
building will also be completely
handicap-accessible, meeting

standards set by the Americans’

with Disabilities Act.

Kalasky said that the new
and improved Newcomb Hall is
a good benchmark for the work
that is to be done on Payne.

The new Payne Hall will con-
tain l2 faculty ofﬁces, a semi-

nar room, several classrooms
and a student lounge. Members
of the design and construction
team worked with deans from
the university to create the plan
for the interior of the building.
Classrooms will be located on all

floors, with the hope of increas-

ing student trafﬁc to all parts of
the building.

The design and construction
team is also attempting to mini-
mize the impact that the Colon-
nade preservation and rehabili-
tation project will have on the
environment. A waste manage-
ment plan was created in order
to maximize the amount of waste
that is recycled, as opposed to just
shipped off to the landﬁll. Also,
whenever possible, regional con-
struction materials are used. The
use of regional materials means
that fewer fossil fuels are used in
the transport of these materials

I because they come from nearby

suppliers.

Despite the fact that so much
work is being done to Payne
Hall, Kalasky said that the build-
ing is going to look pretty much
the same as it did before all of
the construction and rehabilita-
tion began.

“The simplicity of the archi-
tecture speaks for itself”

Payne Hall is the second
building on the Colonnade
to be renovated. The first,
Newcomb is an example of
coming improvements.

Moms and dads come to campus

Parents weekend events range from concerts and classes to athletic events, early-morning hikes and parties

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Every year students look for-
ward to the two fall days that are
spent with their parents, not at
home during Reading Days but
on campus, with approximately
2,000 other visitors.

If you ask a returning student,
they’ll tell you that they love
having fun with their parents,
who may or may not have been
Washington and Lee students
once themselves, at various par-
ties throughout the weekend.
These parties usually range from
“Tex Lex” (an event to celebrate
all of W&L’s Texans) to pledge
class dinners, and the traditional
Red Square band party. But be-
yond the nightlife that brings
parents back to their college
days, the W&L Student Affairs

Department has a lot in store for‘

this year’s Parents and Family
Weekend Celebration.

The weekend kicks off on Fri-
day, November 5, where parents
are welcomed to join students in

their classes. According to Nel-
lie Rice, the Executive Assistant
to the Vice President for Student
Affairs and Dean of Students,
parents are welcome to attend
any on campus class.

Before or after attending
class, parents should drop by the
registration table in the Elrod
Commons Living Room to pick
up a complimentary tote from
Student Affairs and student vol-
unteers.

Rice said she enjoys meeting
parents during registration, “they
email you, but it’s really nice
talking to them face-to-face.”

Parents will also have the op-
tion to attend pre-arranged Finan-
cial Aid Conferences throughout
the day. Between 1 p.m. and 6
p.m. several departments will
host open houses, for students
and their families to attend. The
open houses may include stu-
dent research presentations and
self-guided tours. Career ser-

vices will also host two events
on Friday: an open house and
an hour-long class titled “From
Major to Career.” Appointments
with faculty, administrators and
the University Registrar can also
be pre-arranged throughout the
weekend.

Original to this year’s Par-
ents and Family Weekend will
be an afternoon book signing
with alum Dr. Horace Douty,
class of’54. Douty is the author
of Histogg Lessons from a Coun-
try Church, a book about the
stories ofaRockbridge County’s
250-year-old Oxford Church.
The book signing will be held in
the Elrod Commons Atrium and
is sponsored by the W&L Book-
store.

Earlier on Friday evening,
families of ﬁrst-year students
will have the opportunity to at-
tend a Greek Life Q&A, and
ﬁrst-year females and their fami-
lies will have the chance to tour

the sorority houses. Following
the information on W&L’s Greek
recruitment process, ﬁrst-year
students and their parents are in-
vited to a reception at President
Ruscio’s house.

W&L has organized events for
families to continue on through
the night such as a Night-Sky
Viewing in the Canary Islands,
which will display photos of
planets and galaxies from a 14-
inch shared telescope. The Uni-
versity Choral Concert will take
place in the Wilson Hall Con-
cert Hall at 8 p.m. Tickets are
required for the concert but are
free of charge.

After a long day of tagging
along with students and seeing
what life at W&L in 2010 is re-
ally about, the fun will continue
bright and early on Saturday.
Clay Coleman, director of Stu-
dent Activities and Greek Life,
will direct a 6:30 a.m. morning
run throughout campus. For ex-

ercise fans who ﬁnd 6:30 a.m.
too early after a long night with
their students, the Cycling Club,
also known as Team Traveller,
will lead an hour-long bike ride
for all skill levels.

Once mid-moming exercise
has concluded, the Generals Ral-
ly and Luncheon will be held in
the dining hall before the l p.m.
football game. The rally will fea-
ture the University Jazz Ensem-
ble in the Marketplace. Tickets
are $8.75 per person.

In addition to the football
game against Hampden-Sydney,
W&L swimming will face off
against Randolph Macon Col-
lege at l p.m.

After the athletic events, there
will be a special welcome recep-
tion for grandparents in the Elrod
Commons.

W&L’s a cappella groups and
University Wind Ensemble will
hold concerts Saturday night.
Both events require tickets,

which can be obtained through
the box oﬁice. According to
Rice, the concerts during the
celebratory weekend have been
very well attended in past years.

The W&L Student Affairs
ofﬁce has spent an entire year
putting this weekend celebration
together, with the help of Facili-
ties Management, the Develop-
ment Ofﬁce, Dining Services,
various academic departments,
and of course, W&L students.
Each year, W&L receives an
abundance of positive feedback
from parents and strives to have
the weekend run just as smooth,
if not easier, than last year’s.

According to Rice, “Parents
are easy to please, as long as they
get to spend time on campus with
their students.”

Stopping alcohol-related tragedies

The student health center, Traveller and the new Green Dot program enourage behaviors that keep students safe

By Randi Wilson
COPY EDITOR

Every year 150-200 Washing-
ton and Lee students will wake
up in the health center. Accord-

place on campus they could be.
When a student is taken to the
health center, the nurse on duty

Throughout the night, they are
often checked on to be sure they
are sleeping soundly and still
breathing.

An average of 40-50 students
are sent to the emergency room
for special care before they can
return to the health center for the
rest of their night. Only one or
two cases a year require extend-
ed hospitalization.

W&L’s nurses take care of
those students who might oth-
erwise be put to bed by their
friends and expected to “sleep
it off,” just like they do at other
colleges across the nation.

According to Horton, W&L
students are great at bringing stu-
V dents in when they seem unsafe.
At other colleges, sometimes
the only options are the hospital
(where there is a fear of judicial
action) or just going to bed.

I If a student does not receive
care they might never wake up.

A few weeks ago, Radford
University sophomore Samuel
Mason, 20, was found dead in an
off-campus Tau Kappa Epsilon
house, according to the school
paper. He was a pledge of TKE,
a fraternity already on probation
for serving alcohol to minors.

Mason was seen drinking a
bottle of liquor at the fraternity
house the previous night before
being walked by friends to the
off-campus house and put to
bed.

Police found his body the

poisoning, though there have
been other alcohol-related deaths
in the University’s history.

The last time alcohol played
a role in student deaths was a
drunk driving accident in Octo-
ber of 2000, when two students,
Adam Burchett, 20, and Kristin
Shelton, 18, lost control of their
SUV homecoming weekend and
ﬂipped over on the highway sev-
eral times. The trees on the right
side of the GBD quad are in their
memory.

The student health center
is one of the reasons W&L has
been able to avoid alcohol-re-
lated deaths. Judicial action is
not brought against students that
spend the night in the health cen-
ter. While it has always served
this purpose unofficially, a task

can be brought into the health
center at any time of night, free
of charge and free from worry
about legal or university conse-
quences. “If assistance is needed,
it shouldn’t be denied,” said Hor-
ton.

Horton said that some schools
are not as understanding as
W&L. These schools’ health
centers may turn away intoxi-
cated students, saying “we do
not do that.”

For example, the Radford
University health center is open
until 6 p.m. on Friday, and does
not reopen until 8:30 a.m. Mon-
day morning, according to their
webpage. While they do have a
24-hour emergency call line stu-
dents can access, it’s a far cry
from W&L’s overnight health

According to Horton, chang-
ing times have made it more dif-
ﬁcult for college students to be
safe. Binge drinking is a new is-
sue that simply wasn’t a problem
decades ago. Women are keeping
up with men, going shot for shot
and drink for drink. Men have
discovered alcohol energy drinks
like Four Loko, which contain
5-6 standard drinks in one con-
tainer. The “energy” components
like taurine and guarana, combat
the effects of alcohol, allowing
consumers to drink more without
feeling as poorly.

All of these factors caused
October to be the record month
for the health center: 55 students
were treated, thehighest num-
ber in its history. September was
also very high. Horton believes

Book club turns
the pages back

Page Turners, a new club at W&L, reads lighthearted
children 3* books to destress students

By Kelly Mae Ross
STAFF WRITER

The newest club on campus
aims to put some fun back into
the art of reading—fun that can
be lost during long nights of
reading nothing but textbook af-
ter textbook.

Sophomore Cassie McGinty,
founder of Page Turners, said she
hopes to help members “return to
the roots of reading” by delving
into exciting books.

McGinty said she started
Page Turners because she be-
lieves that despite how academi-
cally successful students are at
W&L, they don’t do enough ﬁin
reading.

McGinty chose works for the
club that she hopes will attract a
variety of people. She said that
she selected works that would
“challenge assumptions” that

people might have, for instance,
about fantasy novels or about
the value of reading a children’s
book when you are 20 years old.

The club will read
works from several
different genres and
meet biweekly to
share their thoughts.

The ﬁrst book that
the club will be read-
ing and discussing
is a children’s novel
entitled Inkheart.

McGinty selected
Inkheart as the ﬁrst
work for the club
because she thought
that reading a chil-
dren’s book during
midterms would put
the least amount of
stress upon members
of the club.

Page Turners will meet some-
time next week to discuss the ﬁrst
several chapters of Inkheart, but
it is not too late for new members
to join the club and get in on the
discussion.

 

Used copies of Inkheart are
available for purchase at a dis-
counted price in the University
Bookstore.

Earlier this week, I sat down
with Alfred S. Thomas, Lexing-
ton’s Chief of Police.

Despite having only been
Chief of Police for the past six
months, Thomas has a ﬁrm grasp
on life in Lexington and how his
department can help improve it.

During our conversation,
Thomas spoke about the con-
cept of community policing and
how he has introduced it to his
ofﬁcers in order to increase com-
munication within the Lexington
community. ‘

Thomas also responded to a
number of criticisms of his de-
partment, including a response to
the “War on Noise” that has seen '
parties shut down earlier and ear-
lier this year.

Ring-Tum Phi: Tell us about
yourself. How did you end up in
Lexington?

Chief Thomas: I’ve been
here for about six months. I was
appointed Chief of Police in Lex-
ington back in April of this year. I
started my career with the Lynch-
burg Police Department. I was in
Lynchburg for over twenty years
and had a number of assignments
during my career there. I attained
the rank of captain, worked as a
patrol captain, the IA [internal af-
fairs] commander for a stint and
also served as a staff captain.

Phi: After entering the police
department, what have you want-
ed to change about it? Is there
anything particular to Lexington
you have wanted to change?

Thomas: One promise I made
the employees here in Lexington
when I ﬁrst arrived was that I am
not going to come in and try to
turn this agency upside down
with changes. I am not going to
try to make this the Lynchburg
Police Department. We will
move slow and deliberate to ﬁnd

out what works here. We will
custom ﬁt the changes towards
Lexington PD. We will not make
changes just to make changes.
It turns out I was wrong, I have
made a lot more changes than
I thought I would make so far.
When problems arise and if I see
an opportunity to do something
better, then we’ll make change.
We’ve made a number of changes
in the last six months, more than
I anticipated. Not changes be-
cause there were major problems
— that is one of the reasons why
I came to this city. This wasn’t a
police department that needed a
culture change. We weren’t hav-
ing problems with ofﬁcers doing
anything rimmoral, unethical or
illegal. But I saw opportunities
to see the department run a bit
more eﬂiciently. I am a huge pro-
ponent of community policing. I
saw an opportunity to take that to
a new level with the talented of-
ﬁcers we have here.

Phi: Can you tell us a little
more about the idea of commu-
nity policing?

Thomas: Absolutely. The
essence of community policing
is partnerships with the com-
munity. Let me preface that by
saying something about the 911
phone system. We made a prom-
ise to the community — if you
dial 911 a policeman will show
up and solve all your problems.
We started to really have that
mindset. Call us; we’re the ex-
perts; we’ll solve your problems
for you and we’ll leave. What we
have discovered over time is that
we are not always the experts.
We don’t always know what all
the problems are and we can’t
solve all your problems. That’s
when community policing really
started to really take hold. Police
started working more as a part-

ner with the community and with
other city government employ-
ees to truly identify, prioritize
and problem solve.‘

Phi: How has community po-
licing come to affect Lexington?

Thomas: There are a num-
ber of programs. Because we
are a small city, that can be good
and that can be bad. Everybody
knows everybody, which is great.
But what I’m ﬁnding is that al-
though we’re small, there is still
sometimes a disconnect. I’ve
seen a number of civic groups
that are all doing good work in
this community, but I’m not sure
they always communicate with
each other. Sometimes you can
have different groups working
on very similar projects that are
not combining or pooling their
resources to become more effec-
tive. That’s where the police can
come in. If were reaching out
and partnering with all the civic
groups that we can, if were going
to community watch meetings, if
were talking to people, we can
be that conduit. We can be the
communication between all the
groups in the city. Especially in a
smaller community, I think that it
is important. You just automati-
cally assume that we all know
everything that is going on in this
area, and we don’t.

Phi: How do you feel you can
help 'Washington and Lee stu-
dents or Virginia Military Insti-
tute students?

Thomas: Well, I don’t really
distinguish between the commu-
nity and W&L students or VMI
students. You are all part of the
community the way I see it. The
students at VMI and the students
at W&L live here. You need to
have ownership in this commu-
nity and that’s how we treat the
students — you are members of

the community. You should not
be treated any differently. You
should have a voice in your com-
munity and be involved in your
community. I know for a fact
that students are very involved.
I gave a speech at the Lexing-
ton Women’s Club and I com-
mended the students, particu-
Iarly at W&L, because of how
involved they are. Students have
more stress now that ever before.
They are doing so much more
and so much more is expected.
But there is still a sense of com-
munity, a sense of service. I am
seeing more and more of that and
I am so impressed. I told the la-
dies at the Women’s Club about
my daughter. She is a 13 year
old at Lylbum Downing Middle
School. One thing that she is
excited about is that W&L girls
go to the school every week and
mentor young girls. I don’t know
if people in the community know
how important that is. My mid-

college student as a mentor. She

The best idea occurred to me
last Wednesday night when a
couple of friends and I went to a
rock concert at the University of
Virginia.

Think about this: driving
your car somewhere and being
able to park it. SAFELY. Iknow
this idea seems a little crazy, par-
ticularly in Lexington.

Lexington is the city where
you can go somewhere for only
two hours at a time. It’s great on
days when you have 3+ hours of
class in a row to attend, and even
better on days when you forget
your car is in two-hour parking.

It is just the best feeling ever
when you stroll back to your car
after a hard day of work and ﬁnd
that shiny green parking viola-
tion on your windshield.

I LOVE paying ﬁfteen dollars
to the City of Lexington, almost

says, “Dad, I can talk to them
about life problems, what its like
to go to high school, what its
like to go to college and we just
talk about life in general.” These
are things that I can’t talk to her
about. She has students who can,
who come in and do that on their
own. I think that is invaluable.
There are programs and things
that students do in our commu-
nity that you don’t get credit for.
Its fun to talk about noise com-
plains and shutting parties down
because that sells papers. I really
don’t think students do a good
job of talking about your com-
munity involvement and all the
important things you do in our
neighborhood. I think you sell
yourselves short, quite honestly.

Phi: You seem to have quite

the positive image of W&L stu-
dents. What about any negative
things you have seen from stu-
dents? .
Thomas: Well, there is one
negative. lt’s not that unusual.
I ’ve seen students make some
poor decisions related to alcohol.
Whether it is underage drinking,
underage possession of alcohol
or excessive drinking, I have seen
some students make some very
poor decisions in that area. Al-
cohol alfects people differently. I
am concerned when I see people
who are drinking in excess leave
a party and are walking alone. I
know we live in a safe city, and I
am proud that this is a safe city.
But you are more likely to be a
victim if you are not using your
faculties, if you are inebriated to
a point where you are not aware
of your surroundings. It is dan-
gerous, and I think that is a prob-
lem. I have seen students leaving
parties walking across the street
laughing and talking, not a care
in the world. They don’t even see
cars driving around. They don’t
pay attention to traffic concerns.
But I will say that I don’t see as
much of that as I used to see in
Lynchburg. It is still problemat-
ic, but what I do see a lot of here
is that people tend to walk in
groups. I think that girls are do-
ing a betterjob of looking out for
each other. I think the male stu-
dents need to step up. If they see
a female or two females by them-
selves and they are walking back
at midnight, they need to escort
them home. Chivalry is not dead.
We are still in the South.

Phi: The W&L community,
especially students, has the per-
ception that the police depart-
ment is out to get them. That of-
ﬁcers want to arrest them, to give
them speeding tickets, violations
and citations in order to increase
department revenue. How do you
respond to this criticism?

Thomas: I would say that is
just the opinion of a few. Over-
all,-the students I’ve met with
and talked to are very intelligent.

as much as I love typing words
in all-caps to accentuate my ar-
guments. ‘

Now, here comes the sob sto-
ry. Have no fear for I have hired
my own violinist to follow me
around. Just this year already, I
have received three parking vio-
lations.

The ﬁrst one I deserved be-
cause I forgot my car was in two
hour parking and left it there all
day.

The second one, I was parked
for about two hours and four min-
utes. That guy was just WAIT-
ING for me.

For the third ticket, I got a
little too cute and thought I could
beat the system.

There is a brick parking lot
below Lee Chapel that is labeled,
“visitor parking”. Apparently

V this is not the case.

They want to learn. They want
to know why things are done the
way they are done. I think that is
the majority of the student base.
There are two sides to every
story. When I met with the IFC
a couple of weeks ago, I asked
them how many noise permits
they thought were issued per year.
The answers ranged from 50 to
100 to 200. We issue in excess of
100. Then I asked how many vio-

' lations they thought were issued

on average each year. I got ev-

. erything from 20 to 50 to 70. The

fact of the matter is that this year,
we have issued four summonses.
I am not sure that is all W&L. It
may not be any W&L. We don’t
distinguish between W&L, VMI
and the community. Last year, for
the entire year, we issued ﬁve. I
don’t like to argue with some-
one over their opinion. Everyone
is entitled to their opinion. I do
like to engage folks in intelligent
discussion. Let’s talk about what
really happens. This community
is very tolerant of students hav-
ing social activities. We don’t
go to parties unless we receive a
complaint from the community.
If there is no complaint, we don’t
respond unless we need to. If we
respond to a complaint, then we
issue a warning. We let students
know that it is time to lower the
noise, control the crowd. If we
get a second complaint, then we
can make a decision whether or
not to take enforcement action.

Phi: How much do you work
with the W&L administration?

Thomas: I interact on a regu-
lar basis with W&L ofﬁcials,
primarily with public safety of-
ﬁcials, but also with the Dean
of Students. We talk whenever
necessary. We have an excellent
relationship to the point where
I feel comfortable contacting
them any time I have a problem.
Believe me, they do the same.
When they hear complaints and
concerns from students, they
pick the phone up and call us.
We’ll either talk on the phone,
email, or if it’s serious, have a
face-to-face meeting. That’s the
best way to work out your prob-
lems. Sit right across from each
other and talk about it.

Phi: Have you spoken with
Dean Watkins concerning a re-
cent article published in the
Ring-Tum Phi? It introduced the
“War on Noise” ~ the fact that
parties have been getting shut
down earlier and earlier com-
pared to earlier years.

Thomas: Yes, Dean Watkins
sent Mike Young [W&L direc-
tor of public safety] over here
to have a face-to-face discussion
with me about that incident. For-
tunately, the deputy Chief of P0-
lice was actually there that night
the party was shut down. I credit
Dean Watkins and Mike Young.
They wanted to know ﬁrsthand.

I purposely did .not register
my vehicle with the school be-
cause I knew that where I live is
too close to campus to utilize the
parking deck.

If I am not going to get any
utility out of registering my car,
why pay the registration fee? So
here is where the trickery comes
in to play.

One day I decide to park in
the Lee Chapel parking lot for
thirty minutes so that I can run
into the Beta fraternity house to
get a quick bite to eat. My vehi-
cle could have been any random
alumnus’, a recruit’s, a prospec-
tive student’s, etc.

Yet, after my totally‘ killer
lunch (it was fajita day), I had
a fat ticket sitting on my wind-
shield and a light bulb hovering
above my head in the form of a
great idea.

Before they jumped to any con-
clusions, they wanted to know
the facts.

.Phi: How would you have a
party operate if you were a part
of the W&L administration?

Thomas: I think something
is working. If we’re having well
over 100 parties in this small
town every year and there are
only four or ﬁve violations, I
think something is working,
don’t you? If we were having
150 parties and 100 violations, if
people were being arrested, if we
were shutting parties down, then
I’d say we have a serious prob-
lem. What we’re lacking now is
communication and planning. I
think that the students being held
accountable should have a plan
if a neighbor feels that a party is
too loud and calls the police. You
can’t plan that at ll:30 the night
of a party. If you are planning a
party and you have a week’s no-
tice, you need to have a plan to
make sure the party stays under
control. That’s an opportunity
where students can do a better
job. Do I have a plan? Can I shut
the music down lower? Can we
have a tent erected? It surprises
me how much a tent really helps
with the sound. We encourage
the students to go out and talk to
the neighbors. It’s important to
be good neighbors. Talk to the
people who live in the area and
let them know. There is a lot of
planning that can be done on the
students’ part. If students have
concerns, then I encourage them
to come sit down and talk to us.
Come meet with the police de-
partment. We want everyone to
have a good time and be safe.
Phi: The W&L administra-
tion has strongly encouraged
on-campus social events, such
as those in fraternity houses, to
those off-campus at Windfall or
the Pole Houses. Do you have a
preference to as where students
go when they go out?
Thomas: I don’t necessar-
ily have a preference. I have no
authority to say where a party
should take place. I know there
is a lot of talk now about bring-
ing parties back to the city. We
don’t have many alcohol-related
arrests right now in the city. I
know folks won’t believe that
[we do], but we really don’t have
very many. The more parties, the
more those numbers will go up.
It’s a numbers game. When par-
ties are in town, we don’t have
students operating motor vehi-
cles. lt’s one thing to be walking
on the street when you’ve had
too much to drink. You might
become a victim. You might put
yourself in danger. If you operate
a motor vehicle, you put every-
one around you in danger.

Cars beware; they are out to get you

Lex Appeal: Helping prospective students choose W&L

After suﬂering bad experiences herself Campbell Burr explains the do is and don ’t for hosting a prospective student

By Campbell Burr
STAFF WRITER

Despite the countless plane
rides, road trips, hotel stays, in-
formation sessions and tours that
made up my college search, it
was ultimately Washington and
Lee Parents’ Weekend that left
the strongest impression.

Parents of younger siblings,
be forewarned: come Sunday,
your second child will want to be
a General, too.

Some thoughts that crossed
my mind over my inaugural Par-
ent’s Weekend:

Are all applicants required to
submit a headshot?

Why is everyone going to the
football game in every color but
royal blue and white?

Is shag/swing dancing a pre-

requisite for admission?

Overnight visits can make or
break an applicant’s view of a
school. My visits to W&L have
been wonderful, but I’ve had less
pleasant experiences at other uni-
Versities.

A word to anyone hosting a
prospective student: you have
the power to make or break his
or her view of your school. Here
are some pointers...

1. Do not drink too much.

My overnight visit to a Vir-
ginia state school would have
been awesome if I hadn’t spent
the entire night making sure my
host didn’t pass out.

I expected that she would take
it easy and look out for me, as I

Remember, rememb

was a senior in high school. Not
so.

The night began with her
having a cocktail (or three) in
her room. She told me that most
nights she ended up “blacking
out somewhere.” That made me
feel good.

We headed to a pregame
down the street. My host walked
in, headed to the bar, and downed
a strong mixed drink.

Before I could say “Gucci,”
she was wasted. She couldn’t
even stand up without putting a
death grip on my shoulder.

When I tried to mingle with
the other students, she followed
me, clasped her hands around
the neck of the nearest boy and
passed out against his chest. At-
tractive.

At one point, my host started
laughing so hard that she fell
onto her back and began rolling
back and forth on the ﬂoor, mum-
bling something indecipherable.
People were staring at her. I ran
over to pull her up. She preferred
the ground.

2. Do not try to impress your
prospective with the amount of
alcohol you can get your hands
on or how “hard” you apparently
go.
During my college visits, I re-
alized that the nerdier the reputa-
tion ofa school, the more its stu-
dents bragged about “how hard
they partied” and the more they

pretended that they didn’t work
or care about school.

At one school it seemed as
if everyone I met was obsessed
with destroying his nerdy high
school reputation, despite the
fact he was attending the world’s
most prestigious university.

As I prepared to head off to a
big football game with my host at
an Ivy League school, I met some
boys determined to convince me
that their weekends involved se-
rious binge drinking.

The moment I walked into
one eating club to meet my host’s
friends, one of them handed me a
beer. Not in the genuine, consid-
erate, “this girl might be thirsty”
kind of way. It was more of an” I
want to show this girl how tight
I am because I can give her alco-
hol” kind of offer.

I considered taking a sip then
spitting it out, “Ew, this tastes
weird!” orjust refusing it, “Mom
would kill me.”

I decided not to accept the
beer. The girl I was with laughed.
“No! Do not start corrupting her
already!” I wanted to remind her
that I actually had a social life
in high school. I probably came
across as awkward and uncom-
fortable, even though I was nei-
ther.

Shortly after another boy
walked into the room holding a
backpack. My guest introduced
us

er the 2nd

Before I could ﬁnish the “nice
to meet you,” he unzipped his
bag to show off the “goods” for
the game.

He described every‘ drink in
his bag, while nodding his head
and laughing about how sick the
day would be. This scene was
faintly reminiscent of a l6-year-
old bragging about raiding his
parents’ liquor cabinet.

3. Do not leave your prospec-
tive to hook up.

and had no way of letting myself
into her locked apartment. To
make matters worse, my phone
was on low battery.

I didn’t know if she had al-
ready gone to the bars down
the street or if she was in one
of the apartme ‘s with her new
“friend.” .

I decided to take a risk and
head downtown. I felt more com-
fortable being in an area that was
populated.

As if that wasn’t bad enough,
later on that night, she left me
in her apartment to go make out
with the boy.

Whatever. At least I got the
bed to myself for part of the
night.

The main point here is to be
a responsible host and don’t act
too cool for school.

This brings me back to Par-
ents’ Weekend. W&L students
seemed normal, well-rounded,

W&L students seemed normal, well-rounded, and most importantly,

happy. There was no bragging about alcohol and no acting like they

didn ’t care about anything. This was rare.

Most of you are probably hor-
riﬁed to think that a host would
actually leave a high school stu-
dent alone on a college campus
to go hook up with someone. Un-
fortunately, it happened to me.

The same drunk girl at the
Virginia state school told me that
she would wait for me outside
of an apartment complex with
the boy she had been leaning on
before while I went to get some-
thing from my car.

When I came back ten minutes
later, she was gone. I tried calling
her. No answer. And again. Still
no answer.

I was unfamiliar with the area

I kept calling her. Still no
answer. And then, I felt it com-
ing. Tears. And then slowly, a
sob, and then as people probably
started wondering, “Who is the
random girl shivering and crying
on a street corner?” My phone
began to ring! My host was call-
ing.

She said she would meet me
outside the bars in a second. She
had been in one of the apartments
hooking up with the boy.

I waited ten minutes, and then
saw a girl in a revealing shirt
stumble over. “I’m so sorry.”
It was the same whiny, drunken
voice. It was too much to take.

of November

and most importantly, happy.
There was no bragging about
alcohol and no acting like they
didn’t care about anything.

This was rare.

It’s refreshing to attend a
school where the students have a
range of talents and interests.

What other schools have fra-
ternity presidents who are skilled
chefs, tennis stars who can recite
the platform of every politician
or future investment bankers
who can use the words “valu-
ation” and “dank” in the same
sentence? I can’t think of one.

The GOP gains in the midterm elections are overshadowed by a rise in independent presence among voters

’. By John Paul Beall

STAFF WRITER

The midterm elections are
ﬁnally over, and they were cer-
tainly interesting to watch. The
political landscape has greatly
changed. In other words, this
election was explosive.

The GOP can cheer that Nan-

For the Senate, the gap has

of blue and red, because the real

has some fundamental changes

Other races have also seen
independents take charge. Con-

system still has enough integrity
to be the dominant force in our
nation’s elections, a non—aligned
movement is picking up speed.

While this election posted
great gains for the GOP and the
Democrats’ power base is large-
ly intact, the old-time oddity of
having an independent such as
Lieberman is becoming more
of a commonality, which speaks
loudly‘ to the change in our coun-
try’s voting habits.

It could either mean that dis-
satisfaction with gridlock has
rendered a need for a third per-
spective, which would mean that
people are largely looking at the
virtues of each candidate (which
would explain some of occur-
rences like the Senate race in
Delaware).

The corollary ofthis indicates
that this movement is positive re-
flection on voters, who are gener-
ally accused ofvoting by party.

Furthermore, the rise in inde-
pendent voting could be a tempo-

rary phenomenon that will recur
as long as the two—party system
is destabilized though partisan-
ship.

On the other hand, it could
be a reflection of the decline of
the party system and its loosen-
ing monopoly on the political
system, which may not be such a
temporary occurrence.

So now that the system has
returned to balance, all politi-
cians must tread carefully. Any
more gridlock could lead to the
dissolution of the political es-
tablishment under two parties, a
system that has given our coun-
try strength in the past.

To paraphrase Benjamin
Franklin, Republicans and
Democrats must hang together
or together they will each hang
separately, as independents are
setting vital precedent with every
move.

This is the inflection point
from which the great change
promised will come.

  How the Democrats lost the midterm elections so badly

Looking back on the successes and failures of the last Congress and what to look for in the next two years

By Summer Lollie
STAFF WRITER

As I watched the midterm
elections come in on Tuesday
night, I’ll admit, I shed a tear or
two, yelled, screamed and possi-
bly threw a few things.

While the Democrats did
manage to retain control ‘of the
Senate (thank you, Tea Party),
the Democrats lost control of the
House of Representatives in a
devastating fashion, leaving me
wondering how we got to this
point.

The Democrats were always
poised to lose seats in both
chambers. In Congress, the party
in power will almost always lose
seats during mid-terrn elections.
Also, the party in power will
most assuredly lose seats if the
economy is down and unemploy-
ment is up.

The Democratic-controlled
111th Congress started their ses-
sion facing the worst economic
downturn since the Great De-
pression and was faced with near
double-digit unemployment ﬁg-
ures.

It is unsurprising that the exit
polls found that almost 9 out of
10 people thought the economy
was in bad shape, and, despite the
fact that the majority of Ameri-
cans still believe that George
Bush and Republican policies
got us into the mess, the Ameri-
can people blamed the party in
power for not ﬁxing it.

However, Democrats can-
not come out of the loss simply
blaming the economy. The Dem-
ocratsplayed a role in their own
defeat.

President Obama and Con-
gressional Democrats had con-

trol of both houses and the presi-
dency, yet decided to play footsie
with a Republican Party that was
determined to be the party of
“no” from the very beginning.
The Republican Party played

except to send a few annoying
videos and encourage people to
hold “Healthcare Parties.”
Instead of mobilizing the
base, the Democratic Party did
the opposite; they demobilized it

as many troops to Afghanistan,
and continued and expanded the
Bush/Cheney national security
policies.

How much more centrist
could Obama and Congressional

Now, the Republicans have to deal with a fractious party as they ﬁgure

out who the hell these Tea Party candidates are and what they want.

Republicans will quickly discover what they learned in 1994 — that it is

much easier to talk than to govern.

the obstructionist legislation af-I
ter legislation with the goal of
gridlock.

Democrats could not swal-
low the fact that the Republican
Party was not going to come to
the middle and work with them.

In 2008, the people gave
President Obama and Congres-
sional Democrats a mandate, and
instead of using that mandate to
govern, they gave the public tep-
id legislation in the name of bi-
partisanship that was never really
going to come. The Republicans
were dead set to block anything
the Democrats put out.

And what happened to the co-
alition that Obama and the Dem-
ocrats built in 2008, anyway?

President Obama’s presiden-
tial run left the Democrats one of
the strongest voter mobilization
networks this nation has seen,
promising to keep the voters en-
gaged as they governed.

Yet, until the upcoming days
of -the election, the Democrats
did not use their Organizing For
America network for two years

by chasing after the Republicans
and ignoring their base.

It didn’t help any when Rahm
Emmanuel called the Demo-
cratic base “t"‘*king retards”.
One should not bite the hand that
feeds them and then expect more
snacks.

However, do not believe the
things you will hear following
the election. President Obama
and Congressional Democrats
did not overreach. The TARP
(bank bailout) was Bush’s baby.
The stimulus package, deemed
too small anyway, was needed to
stave off the economic downturn
the Bush policies created, and
the ﬁnancial regulations bill was
deemed insuﬁicient by the ma-
jority of Americans.

Do not believe that this elec-
tion loss meant that Obama and
Congressional Democrats should
have moved more toward the
center.

He was always in the center.
He cut taxes, passed Mitt Rom-
ney’s healthcare plan, opened
off-shore drilling, sent twice

Democrats be?

In fact, it was the Blue Dog
Democrats who took the most
losses. While unfortunate for
those needing Democratic rep-
resentation in purple states, Blue
Dogs chose to act like Republi-
cans and thus shot themselves in
the foot.

Trying to imitate a Republi-
can will not bring you votes, es-
pecially if voters can pick a real
Republican.

Do not believe that this elec-
tion is a vindication of ‘conser-
vative philosophy. Demoralized
Obama voters stayed at home,
and non-aligned independents
defected, voting against a lousy
economy—they voted for perfor-
mance rather than ideology.

Democrats did do a lot: passed
ﬁnancial reform law that prohib-
ited banks from engaging in pro-
prietary trading and established a
Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau to look out for the inter-
ests of everyday Americans.

Democrats passed the health-
care reform bill, preventing in-

surance companies from denying
insurance because of a pre-exist-
ing conditions, cut prescription
drug cost for Medicare recipi-
ehts by 50%, extended beneﬁts
to same-sex partners of federal
employees, passed the Ameri-
can Recovery & Reinvestment
Act of 2009: a $789 billion eco-
nomic stimulus plan and signed
the Children’s Health Insurance
Reauthorization Act, which pro-
vides health care to 11 million
kids - 4 million of whom were
previously uninsured. They
also signiﬁcantly expanded Pell
grants, which help low-income
students pay for college. The list
goes on and on.

On a side note, I would like
to say that one of the biggest ca-
sualties of Tuesday night (setting
aside Prop. 19) is that Nancy Pe-
losi will no longer be Speaker of
the House.

Speaker Pelosi walked lock-
step, synchronized with President
Obama and ALWAYS got the
votes. The House was dispropor-
tionally blamed for the Senate’s
failures. Nancy Pelosi didn’t de-
serve this. Harry Reid did, yet it
was Pelosi who lost her job.

Where, you ask, does all of
this lead us? Well, more grid-
lock, that’s for sure.

Keep a lookout for Boehner
and Cantor calling to shut the
government down.

Watch out for moves to put
Wall Street in charge of Social
Security and insurance compa-
nies in charge of Medicare, and
get ready for the ridiculous use of
Congressional time and money as
the Republicans try to “investi-

gate” the Obama administration.
For Republicans, the NoBama
policy stopped Tuesday.

Now, the Republicans have
to deal with a fractious party as
they ﬁgure out who the hell these
tea party candidates are and what
they want.

Republicans will quickly
discover what they learned in
l994—that it is much easier to
talk than to govern. Republican
policies got us into this mess;
let’s see if their policies can get
us out of it. -

President Obama does have
one advantage: he is one voice
against the babble of Republican
and Tea Party voices.

This is the time when Presi-
dent Obama and Congressional
Democrats can make the differ-
ences between Democrats and
Republicans very clear.

This is not the time to appease
Republicans. Stand your ground,
President Obama.

Truman stood his ground,.
Reagan stood his ground. Now
it is time for President Obama to
stand his ground and stay true to
the principles he campaigned on
to get elected.

As the Republicans struggle
to bring their caucus together,
improve the economy and create
jobs while beholden to the busi-
ness interests that funded their
campaigns, the Democrats need
to let it be known that they are
a party of political courage, not
political contributions.

Democrats need to regain their
voice as the party for the people
by the people and remember who
and what they are ﬁghting for.

The trouble with rooting for both Donkeys and Cowboys

As his beloved Dallas Cowboys and Democratic Party take their seats in the cellar, Stockton Bullitt laments on the loss

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I’m a Democrat and a fan of

I the Dallas Cowboys, so this re-

ally hasn’t been the ideal autumn
for me.

I’ve had the joy of listening to
Sean Hannity call Barack Obama
racist against black people, and
even worse, I’ve had to remind
a friend of mine who is a Giants
fan that Jon Kitna was a washed
up quarterback for the Lions
three years ago!

I really wanted to make this
article a giant pity party for me.
Oh, how difficult my life is: Re-
publicans kicked the Democrats’
ass this past Tuesday almost as
badly as the Jaguars (reminder:
Jacksonville is a city in the Unit-
ed States, albeit an irrelevant
one, and it does have a football
team) dismantled the Cowboys
in their own stadium.

Did I mention my best fantasy
football player is Peyton Hillis?

But the more I think about it,
the happier I am about this situ-
ation. Being a Democrat and a
Cowboys fan hasn’t really been
that easy since early 2009. This
school is ﬁlled with Republican
fans of every other team in the
NFC East, so it’s not like the
daily taunting I get is new to me.

Plus, for the last three years,
the head coach of my favorite
football team and the Congres-
sional speaker for my party have
been Wade Phillips and Nancy
Pelosi.

Are you serious?

With the unemployment rate
hovering around 9%, it is noth-
ing short of a crime that these
two strangely similar individuals
have been getting a generous sal-
ary for a combined seven years.

Every time either one of their
faces ﬁashes on the TV screen, I
have to ﬁght the insatiable urge
to throw something. And I’m the
one who’s supposed to root for

these guys.

By the way, Republicans,
wipe that smile off your face. Re-
member, Michael Steele, a.k.a.
Brad Childress, is still the head
of your party.

Yes, this is a time of cleansing
for both the Democrats and the

Dallas Cowboys.

I can ﬁnally sit back and put
all my chips on Obama like I
wanted to do from day one of
his presidency, and I no longer
have to wait until early January
for Tony Romo to treat my hopes
and dreams like his own personal
Jessica Simpson.

I am in the position I was
used to growing up: watching the
“Daily Show” for clips of blatant
Republican lying and reading
Mel Kiper Jr. for his thoughts
on early draft picks of defensive
backs (I’m preordering my Cow-
boy Prince Amukamara jersey as
we speak).

Moving forward, this apoca-
lyptic week could not be better
for the long term future of both
my party and my team.

The Cowboys are ﬁnally go-
ing to get themselves rid them-
selves of Jason Garrett and Wade
Phillips, who proved to be as in-
telligent under pressure as W&L
students on Windfall once the
cops show up.

Plus, Dallas leads the league
in attendance and has the most
money, so it’s not like they are
the Cavaliers and won’t be good
for another quarter of a century
or so. Sorry, Cleveland, at least
you have Eric Mangini to look
forward to.

My certainty in the Demo-
crats is a little more complicated
to explain.

For starters, is having a Dem-
ocratic President and a Repub-
lican Congress all that bad for
anybody?

The last time we had it, 1994,
led to a pretty sweet six ‘years in
America. The economy was good
and the biggest foreign policy
issue was a war in Kosovo that
mattered inﬁnitely less to Ameri-
cans than Kurt Cobain’s death
and Hanson’s new album.

For the last two years, I’ve
had to constantly hear about how
evil and idiotic Democrats were.

I had the pleasure of listen-
ing to extended tirades about
the similarities between Barack
Obama and Vladimir Lenin.

So, Republicans, you got
what you wanted. I look forward
to seeing the fruition of all this
proposed change that I keep see-
ing in commercials. __

You say that you are going to
ﬁx the way Washington is run,

Remember the wonderful job
you did with responsibly coming
out of the 2001 recession, con-
trolling government spending
from 2000-2008, and getting out
of wars during the Bush admin-
istration?

Oh, you’re over that now.
Well, have fun ignoring the Tea
Partiers and leftover neo-cons
in your own party now that you
have the power back.

More importantly, let’s say
you are who every single Repub-
lican here says he or she is: “Lib-
ertarians” with a little Reagan
thrown in there.

In other words, you ﬁnd ways
to drastically cut down on gov-
ernment spending without hav-
ing to resort to taxes and ﬁx this
war in Afghanistan, all the while

Republicans do works out. Then
Obama can just take credit for all
that success.

If you believe that Americans
are too smart to see that logic.
Remember they were dumb
enough to expect Obama to pay
their mortgage and Christine
O’Donnell to perform witchcraft
once elected.

Just know this, Republicans:
enjoy this election as much as
you can for the next two months.

Despite not controlling the
Senate, you are the ones with the
momentum.

You just started dating the
hot, popular chick, and right now
she’s in the honeymoon phase.

This is the time when you
break out your “NObamaCare”
t-shirts.

mg once spring rolls around.

So with my football team and
political party in disarray, I’m
looking to the future.

I’m excited for Bill Cowher
to be introduced as the new head
coach of the Dallas Cowboys.

I’m excited to see some won-
derfully stagnant Congressional
bills.

Mostly though, I’m excited
to see what you Republicans do
with this opportunity.

Yes, you guys might ﬁnd suc-
cess with all your proposed leg-
islation, and maybe you’ll even
wise up to the fact that your best
candidate for 2012 BY FAR is
Haley Barbour.

The current governor of Mis-
sissippi is the only member of
the GOP who actually scares

Oh, how diﬁicult my life is: Republicans kicked the Democrats ’ass this

past Tuesday almost as badly as the Jaguars (reminder: Jacksonville is

For all the shit you give us
Democrats, these past two years
haven’t really been the complete
failure you said it has.

Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell? Mis-
sion Accomplished.

Troops out of Iraq? You’re
welcome.

Health Care? Failed. Oh wait,
that passed? Sucks bro...

Now it’s your turn.

You think you can balance
this economy, stiﬂe government
spending, and win the war in Af-
ghanistan? Go right ahead. I’m
all ears.

somehow getting our economy
out of the toilet.

If that happens, then my life
has just been made drastically
better, and I’m perfectly ﬁne
with that scenario.

This is where Baracka Flaka
Flame‘ comes in (Barack Obama
for those who haven’t seen the
YouTube video). He’s a winner
either way this works out.

Let’s say the Republicans de-
cide to abide byvtheir “no com-
prise” slogan and don’t work
with Obama _on anything. Then,
Obama can play the helpless
president card for the 2012 elec-
tion.

And let’s say everything the

This is the time when you re-
mind Democrats about how this
is the biggest swing in the House
since 1932.

This is the time when you
go around telling everyone you
kicked out the only thing worse
than Michael Moore, a San Fran-
cisco liberal, for some guy named
Boner. . .er. . .Boehner.

Remember though, once Jan-
uary rolls around, you are going
to be the ones with the respon-
sibility.

You are going to have to
convince that hot, popular girl
why she needs to stay with you
through 2012, and let me tell you,
her eyes are going to start drift-

any Democrat, and his fund rais-
ing efforts with the Republican
Govemor’s Association have
surpassed even the RNC’s. Trust
me, the only thing stopping this
guy is_ a heart attack from his
umpteenth Wendy’s run.

But, just like I know that the
Cowboys will make the playoff
in 2011, I know that Republicans
won’t ride off into the sunset that
easily.

I know that Sarah Palin or
Mitt Romney will ﬁnd some way
to get back into the presidential

will be distracted.

So, have fun with your new
Congress, Republicans, I’ll be

. Rugby player from half way around the world

W&L sophomore applies his skills from F iji on the rugby ﬁelds of Southwest Virginia

By Holly Suthers
ARTS&LlFE EDITOR

Hailing from the remote vil-
lage of Natewa, Fiji, Tuwi Ro-
kodulu became involved with
Washington and Lee’s Scream-
ing Minks Rugby Team in an
eﬂ°ort to stay in touch with his
roots. The sophomore has been
involved with the team since the
pre-season of his freshman year
and has continued to be an inte-
gral member.

. The Screaming Minks have a
long-standing history at W&L.
Established in 1966, the team
has traveled all over the country
to compete. The Minks are cur-
rently in the midst of their fall
season and will have another
season in the spring. The rugby
team is part of Campus Activities
and Recreation and is coached by
Tom Lovell and John Welsh.

As a continuation to the'Cam—
pus Recreation Spotlight series,
Tuwi agreed to answer questions
about the team and his involve-
ment in it.

Phi: How long have you
played rugby? .

Tuwi: I have played rugby
ever since I can remember. In
Fiji primary school rugby is di-
vided into four grades namely
A’s, B’s and C’s and D’s. D’s are
grades 1 and 2, C’s are 3 and 4
up until A’s which encompass the
upper grades of primary school,
I guess it would be termed mid-

dle school here. In Form 3, I
switched to soccer but promptly
switched back the year after that.
After that it has been all rugby up
until this point.

Phi: What is your favorite as-
pect of playing rugby at W&L?

Tuwi: I really like the com-
radeship between the players,
themselves and with the coaches.
I’m used to a cutthroat competi-
tive environment if I wanted to
play for the starting 15 or the
starting 7. Here it is more re-
laxed and friendly and really
allows me to just enjoy playing
with friends.

Phi: Do you have a favorite A

memory or story that took place
during a rugby match, practice,
etc.?

Tuwi:
memory last year was that of
Vos David, Law Exchange stu-
dent last year, and [sophomore]
Miguel Garza I3’. Vos would
put in a perfect cross the ﬁeld
kick and Miguel would have the
sheerspeed, balance and timing
to score time after time. This
season so far [sophomore] John
Hale’s kicking game has been
quite impressive. Of course off
the ﬁeld, it is having dinner with
Coach John and his family and
especially being entertained by
his son JP.

Phi: How much time do you

My favorite rugby ,

put into the Rugby Club?

Tuwi: Basically it is just two
hours every Tuesday, Thursday
and Friday and usually the whole
of Saturday, too.

brute force, loads of injuries and
a lack of elegance. However, it
all comes down to preparation,
not unlike any other sport. In
fact once a team starts getting to-

because that deﬁnitely played a
role. It also helped that friends
were already here namely [ju-
nior] Raisa Velasco and [senior]
Anitesh Lal.

  

comments that you would like to
add? -

Tuwi: I would really like to
thank thosefamiliar faces on the
rugby ﬁeld sidelines, thanks for

Tuwi Rokodulu takes to the rugby field at the beginning of the match on a gorgeous fall Saturday.

Phi: Is there anything about
the rugby team that you would
like the campus to know about?

Tuwi: Other than the fact that
we still need people to come out,
not really, no. But on a more se-
rious note I think rugby has the
misconception that it isjust sheer

gether, it is uniquely elegant and
makes for a good watch. -

Phi: Why did you choose to
come to W&L?

Tuwi: It was a variety of fac-
tors, chiefly among them the
Honor system. I would be re-
miss to blot out rugby here, too,

Phi: What is your favorite as-
pect of W&L?

Tuwi: The small classes
would have to be it and the easy
relation to the professors. Other
than that it would have to be my
friends.

Phi: Do you have any other

coming out to support the team.
Also to those of you who buy
rugby tee’s, thanks, as well. Ku-
dos to my Host Mum and Dad

rugby’ cheerleader [sophomore]

Subject of musical too dark for one student

‘Assassins ’reviewer says that the story line and music was depressing, but that the actors played their roles to a tee

By Julie Hansen
smrr wnmzn

Washington and Lee’s dq-
partments of Music, Theater and
Dance showed their portrayal of
Assassins, a musical based on
an idea by Charles Gilbert, Jr.,
with music and lyrics by Ste-
phen Sondheim; think “Sweeney
Todd.”

Before I get into the nitty—grit—
ty details, let me just warn you,
Assassins is a play you probably
shouldn’t take your grandmother
or younger sister to. There is no
want of swearing or gunﬁre; there
are rather vivid interpretations of
death and execution; and, for a
musical, there is a great deal of
long soliloquies.

The musical itself has an eerie
vibe to it, dealing with the deaths
of presidents and the thoughts
that possess people to murder a
national ﬁgure, whether the rea-
sons were for infamy, politics
or pure psychosis. Furthermore,
the anachronistic conversations
between assassins left me con-
fused; it was a break from the
historical facts and speculations

that the musical is greatly based
off of. Adding to the confusion
was the non-chronological pre-
sentation of assassinations, espe-
cially since I need to brush up on
my U.S. presidents.

In all fairness, most of my
complaints really can be blamed
on the script and my own person-
al preferences in musicals. I had
a conversation with a classmate
who saw the same showing and
he came away praising the things
I was criticizing, namely “Un-
worthy Of Your Love,” a song in
which John Hinckley, played by
freshman Yates Wilbum, and Ly-
nette “Squeaky” Fromme, played
by freshman Kaitlyn Farley,
sang to their respective muses,
Jodie Foster and Charles Man-
son. I said it felt bizarre hearing
crazy people sing to their unre-
quited loves as though they were
religious ﬁgures; he said that was
the point, he had never thought
about assassin’s reasoning’s be-
hind their actions.

Despite, what I interpreted as a

very dark musical, W&L music,
theater and dance stars shined
throughout. Senior Johnny Coyle
played a relatable, almost likable
John Wilkes Booth; that is, when
he wasn’t acting as menacing,
time-traveling instigator of more
than a centuries’ worth of assas-
sinations, which he did just as
convincingly. In fact, Booth is
the sanest assassin in the whole
show, killing the president as a
political statement against the
Civil War, rather than for an ul-
cerated stomach, like Giuseppe
Zangara, played by freshman
Raya Taylor, attempted.
Furthermore. with freshmen
comprising more than a third of
the cast, Assassins was a genuine
exhibition of new W&L talent.
Freshman Keith Trump brought
an endearing quality to the musi-
cal as he performed as the Bal-
ladeer. With an excellent voice
and stage-presence to match",
Trump helped break the ten-
sion and serve as comic relief;
especially in Charles Guiteau’s.

execution scene. While the au-
dience (well, at least I) cringed
and waited for Guiteau, played
by sophomore Tyson Janney, to
be hanged Trump came in danc-
ing along with Janney, mocking
the evangelist jack of all trades
up until his ﬁnal breath. Not to
mention, “The Ballad of Booth”
kicked off the musical’s almost
comedic view of Booth’s actions,
which was seen as more chann-
ing than derogatory.

Other new talent included
Kaitlyn Farley who, despite
playing a crazy hippie, was able
to show off her voice while sing-
ing about her equally crazy idol-
boyfriend-son of god, Charles
Manson. Also, freshman Sarah
Williams had an excellent vo-
cal presence in “Something Just
Broke,” a favorite song of mine
from the musical considering it
seemed to restore the severity of
the acts ofthose portrayed in As-
sassins.

W&L really excelled at
bringing out the humor in this

dark comedy. With her excellent
comic timing and stage presence,
junior Jeni Pritchett brought Sara
Jane Moore to life as a hilarious,
naive, crazy-mom-down-the-
street character.

And, when Assassins wasn’t
making me laugh, it was cer-
tainly giving me chills. From
the executions to the projection
of John F. Kennedy’s assassina-
tion, I was sucked into the past
and experienced ‘both what the
assassins may have felt and what
the general public may have felt.
At times, both understanding
and sympathy were felt for all of
the assassins, even the psychotic
ones like for Leon Czolgosz,
who was played heartbreakingly
genuine by senior Dave Curran.
Czolgosz was it ﬁrst-generation
Polish-American who worked in
a glass factory until the pressures
and inequalities of immigrant
overcame him. If there was any
assassin I felt the most compas-
sion for, it was Czolgosz.

While W&L Music and The-

ater did an excellent job of pre-
senting Assassins as an informa-
tive and compelling presentation
of U.S. history, ifl could have
changed one thing, it would have
been the projection screens on
the back of the stage. Though
at times they did show relevant,
heart-wrenching photos, such
as the children living in the city
slums during the late l9th centu-
ry, a lot ofthe time I found them
rather distracting. It is true that I
have a short attention span, but
also it seemed like at times it was
just a Google images search. The
action would have been more
compelling with just the bare
stage.

Despite my criticisms, Assas-
sins was an amazing musical that
left me feeling chilled and reﬂec-
tive, especially about the types
of circumstances that lead to as-
sassination attempts; It made me
want to ﬁght for equality, as well
as increase security measures ev-
erywhere.

Greeks put on a successful carnival again

Members of fraternities and sororities organize and volunteer at the Halloween Community Carnival at the YMCA

‘By Mary Helen Turnage

STAFF WRITER

Several Lexington and Rock-
bridge County families attended
the annual Halloween Commu-
nity Carnival last Saturday to
show off their costumes, play
games and win prizes. The tunes
of “The Monster Mash” and
“Thriller” played throughout the
day while children, parents and
Washington and Lee student vol-
unteers were ﬁlled with smiles
on the crisp fall afternoon.

The event is a joint effort
among the Greek men and wom-
en of W&L. The Panhellenic
Council organized and plarmed
the event, while the lnterfraterni-
ty Council (IFC) provided a large
number of volunteers and helped
cover expenses.

“This year we chose to beneﬁt
the YMCA’s Fall Membership
Drive and the event was held
in their parking lot,” said junior
Kenzie Doss, Panhellenic’s Pro-
gramming/Public Relations Ex-

ecutive and head of the carnival
this year. I

In previous years, each frater-
nity or sorority was responsible
for running a given booth, but this
year the fraternities were asked
to provide the actual games.

“A few fraternities really
went above andbeyond. Sigma
Chi made a great ‘Pin the Tail on
the Donkey’ and a few members
of Beta sacriﬁced themselves
for ‘Pie a Greek,’ which just so
happened to be the most popu-
lar game with the kids. KA was
also very enthusiastic about their
face-painting,” said Doss.

In 2004, the manager of Wal-
Mart proposed the idea to Pan-
hellenic because he thought that
Greeks might be interested in
volunteering for a community
carnival. W&L Greek organiza-
tions have participated in the
event ever since.

Local organizations also con-

tributed to the carnival. Dave’s
Produce donated 50 hay bales
and 300 pumpkins. The mission
ofthe carnival is to improve rela-
tions with the Rockbridge Com-
munity.

As a winner ofthe Gamma Phi
Beta College Panhellenic Award
in 2008, the Panhellenic Council
at W&L works hard to enhance

the Greek image on campus and 

in the Lexington area. With help
from all Greek organizations on
campus, the carnival serves as
a great way for fraternity and

sorority members to show their 

loyalty to the Rockbridge area.
i“We don’t raise money, we

don’t raise awareness, it is just

about giving to the community,”

said senior Panhellenic President , '

Sarah Merritt.

ing of ﬁrst-years Brendan Mc-
Goldrick and Matthew Hesser,
senior Dorsey Terry and junior

Brian Stirling, came in with a
time of 1:32.34.

The women also had an im-
pressive showing on Friday. Five
different swimmers came home
with ﬁrst-place individual ﬁnish-
es, and, like the men, landed one
relay team in the top spot.

Juniors Elizabeth ‘Stames
and Jocelyn Cassada claimed
event victories in the 1000-yard

who ﬁnished on top in a time of
1:54.91.

Both teams swam again the
following day in the Centre Col-
lege Invitational. They swam

women. The Generals’ men’s
team came in right behind them

touched in ﬁrst in the 50-yard
freestyle in a time of 21.39 and

ner in the 100-yard backstroke,

Generals stopped short of ﬁnals

Washington and Lee s ﬁeld hockey season ended after a loss in the ODAC semiﬁnal game Wednesday

By Kirsten Kyne

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld
hockey team ended their season
Wednesday night at Randolph
Macon College in the ODAC
semiﬁnal game. After suffering
a 2-0 deﬁcit in the ﬁrst half, the
Generals began to come back but
were shut down, the score ending
at 5-3.

“I don’t think the score re-
ﬂected how we play the game,”
said sophomore Katherine Price.

off the scoring for the Generals
and senior Emmy Matthew’s goal

the game to allow the Generals
to have an 11th ﬁeld player. The
strategy seemed to work because
junior Christina Benedetti scored
the third goal, but the team was
unable to capitalize on the shots
and comers they had.

The Generals held a 28-7 shot
advantage and 19-2 penalty cor-
ner advantage against the Yel-

ﬁnd the goal. “We had so many

there,” Edmonds said. “Luck

Generals’ streak continues

W&L Football Continues ﬁeld dom

By Burl Roiett
STAFF WRITER

The Generals extended their winning
streak to ﬁve games with a record—break-
ing 49-14 victory last Friday at Catholic
University.

Washington and Lee (6-2, 5-0) rushed

‘for an ODAC single-game record 496

yards and broke the ODAC record and the
W&L’s school record for rushing yards in
a single season on their way to the ﬁrst
5-0 ODAC conference start in school his-
tory. They are currently at 3,008 rushing
yards for the season with two games left
to play.

The Generals’ entire offensive line
earned ODAC Player of the Week Honors
for their performance. The players on the
line are senior Greg Kurkis, junior John
Fitzgibbons, sophomore Mike Stefanelli
and ﬁrst-years Bobby Jones and Connor
Hollenbeck. .

Sophomore Luke Heinsohn led the way
with 114 rushing yards and a touchdown,
while fellow sophomore Brett Murray ran

for 101 yards and junior Harrison Hudson

added 100 yards and two touchdowns. Se-
nior Jason Zelesnik also ran for his ﬁrst

touchdown of the season.

Junior quarterback Charlie Westfal had
three completed passes with only ﬁve at-
tempts, including a couple of long touch-
down passes. He hit senior tight end Pat-
rick Conley over the middle for a 36 yard
catch and run in the ﬁrst quarter, and later
found Harrison Hudson down the right
sideline for a 30 yard touchdown. Westfal
also added 71 yards on the ground.

The Generals held the Cardinals to only
14 points, the lowest they have held an op-
ponent all season, and forced turnovers at
crucial times. Catholic’s ﬁrst drive ended
on a fumble deep in Generals’ territory,
recovered by sophomore linebacker Doug
Fraser inside the W&L ﬁve yard line.

Sophomore safety Jake Pelton also
intercepted Catholic quarterback Greg
Cordivari at the one yard line in the sec-
ond quarter. Pelton would add a second
interception in the second half and earned
ODAC Defensive Player of the Week
honors for his perfonnance. This week
marked the third week out of the last four
that Peltbn was awarded this honor.

ination as they move to 5-0 in ODA C play

Catholic managed only 100 yards rush-
ing yards, almost exclusively by running-
back Nick Cortese, but the Cardinals did
move the ball effectively through the air.
Cordivari completed 21 of 36 passes for
209 yards, and Lawrence DeSi1none led
the way with six receptions.

Ball control played a huge role in the
lopsided victory. The Generals held pos-
session for 41 minutes and 22 seconds,
compared to only 18 minutes and 38
seconds for Catholic. W&L also scored
touchdowns off of each of Catholic’s four
turnovers for a total of 28 points.

The Generals also set a new ODAC
record for rushing touchdowns on the sea-
son with a current total of 33.

Looking ahead, W&L will host Hamp-
den-Sydney this Saturday at 1:00. Both
teams will enter the game undefeated in
the ODAC, and Washington and Lee will
clinch the outright ODAC championship
and an automatic bid to the NCAA tourna-
ment with a win.

Women win 3, lose I at Emory National Invitational; move to 25-5

By Llzz Dye
STAFF wmrsn

Washington and Lee opened the Emory
National Invitational in Atlanta, Georgia
with a 3-2 win over Berry College, which
would lead them to three more victories
and a tough loss on Friday, October 30.

W&L, with a season record of 23-4 at
the time, came from behind to defeat the
Vikings, 20-9, and post its ninth-straight
victory, 25-23, 21-25, 23-25, 25-20, 15-
11.

The W&L volleyball team won its 10th
match in a row with a 3-1 victory over
Maryville. W&L defeated the Scots, who
were 14-15 on the season, 28-26, 19-25,
25-22, 25-18. It was the second 10-match
winning streak of the season for the Gen-
erals.

First year outside hitter M.A. Boles was
one of three to record at least _l0 kills and
had15 total, while junior middle blocker
Lindsey Dee had 12 and junior outside hit-
ter Megan Daily added 10. Boles also had
11 digs and two service aces.

Sophomore libero Cameron Hill posted
a team-high 13 digs and ﬁrst-year Nikki
DelZenero had 21 assists, 7 digs and two
service aces.

The Generals’ volleyball team was

once again victorious as they recorded
their llth win in a row with 3-2 over
Birmingham-Southem College in at the
Emory National invitational in Atlanta,
Georgia on an exciting afternoon. W&L
(25-4) defeated the Panthers (23-11) 25-
17, 21-25, 25-23, 18-25, 15-8.

Junior Lindsey Dee led the Gener-
als with an impressive career-high nine
blocks and complemented that with eight

skills with a team-high 13 kills to go
with 15 digs and a pair of blocks. Junior
Megan Daily came out with twelve kills
while sophomore right side Bailey Walker
had ten and senior middle blocker Louise
Brooks recorded nine. '

A great day for the Generals got even
better when ﬁrst-year setter Nikki Del-
Zenero had a team-high 23 assists and 11
digs, while ﬁrst year Meghan Meleski had
21 assists, and sophomore libero Cameron
Hill led the team with 23 digs.

Unfortunately, when the Generals ad-
vanced in the tournament to play No. 2
Emory University, they lost 3-0. W&L
(25-5) fell to the second-ranked Eagles
(27-4), 25-19, 25-17, 25-10.

Daily tallied seven kills while Dee
recorded ﬁve kills and a pair of blocks.
Hill had ten digs and once again led the
defense. Meleski had a team-high 14 as-
sists. At the conclusion of play, both Dee
and Boles were honored and named to the
All-Tournament Team.

Captain Daily said that she is “con-
tinually impressed with how well our ﬁrst
years ﬁt in with the team. They all came in
and have made immediate contributions.”
She also noted that the “seniors have re-
ally fostered a positive team chemistry,
which has manifested in how well we
have done this season. Every day we are
working hard in the gym to get better and
maximize our performance.” She also said
“while we were successful at Emory, we
are building up to the ODAC tournament
to hopefully win and have a great run in
the NCAA tournament.”

The Emory National Invitational con-
cluded W&L’s regular reason play. The
ﬁrst-seeded Generals will next take on
