Ford speaks at VMI

on leadership

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The United States should take
‘the mantle of leadership of the
free world,” former President

,Gerald R. Ford told a Cameron
Hall audience of about 5,000 last
night.

Before accepting that leader-
ship role, though, Ford said, the
U.S. must continue to pursue
“sound fiscal and monetary
policies’ and modernize and
strenghten its military forces to
obtain ‘‘a sufficient margin of
safety for our own security.”

Ford said the free nations are
beginning to look toward the
U.S. for leadership and he said
he was encouraged by a trend
away from the ‘‘anti-American-
ism’’ of the early 1960s and late
1970s.

After holding the second
World Forum in Vail, Colo., in
August, Ford said the 57 leaders
came to the consensus that ‘‘the
free world looked to and was
dependent on the United States
of America for leadership to
carry them forward to meet the
Soviet Union and the Com-
munist threat around the globe.

“Since then,’ Ford con-
tinued, ‘‘I must confess, I have
asked myself are we prepared
in this country to carry on this
role of global leadership?

“IT believe the U.S. will res-
pond to that call for leadership,
and the best evidence is the
growing economy, our improv-
ed military preparedness and
our firmness in dealing with our
global military adversary, the
Soviet Union.”

Ford decried the federal
budget deficit of $200 billion in
the fiscal year that ended Fri-
day. “For one year, this deficit
is manageable, but over the
long haul, it is totally unaccep-
table and intolerable.... It
could abort our economic pro-
gress out of the recession.”’

The government should hold
the line on domestic expen-
ditures, increase defense ex-
penditures by 5 to 6 percent and
develop some _ alternative
revenues by the fiscal year 1985,
Ford said.

“Reagan is doing the right
thing, and we’re on the right
track,’ Ford said. “But we’d
better keep a steady hand on the
tiller.”’

A Constitutional amendment
requiring a balanced federal
budget is ‘not the answer,”’
though, Ford said, and it would
be full of loopholes. ‘‘Under no
circumstances can you solve
our country’s fiscal problems
by quick fixes,’’ he added.

Professor injured in plane crash

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Prof. Lyman R. Emmons was
listed in satisfactory condition
late Wednesday night after the
single-engine Cessna he was
piloting crashed in the nearby
town of Glasgow Sunday night.
The four passengers on board
were injured.

Emmons, a_ professor of
biology who has been with the
university since 1961, was taken
to the University of Virginia
Hospital in Charlottesville.

State Trooper W.L. Warren,
who was called to the scene on
U.S. 501 about thirty minutes
after the 5:30 p.m. crash, said
that Emmons was practicing
takeoffs and landings when the
accident occurred.

‘*He was coming in to land,”
Warren said, ‘‘and when the
wheels touched the ground,
there was something he didn’t
like, so he tried to get the craft
airborne again — make a ‘go
around.’

“He applied power to in-
crease his altitude, and when he

pulled up the left wing touched
the ground, causing the craft to
go into an embankment with a
cartwheel effect.”

Warren, who called the plane
‘a total loss,” said that he is
taking photographs and gather-
ing statistical data as part of his
investigation.

“My primary concern is if
any violations of Virginia law
were involved,” he said. ‘I’m
still looking.”

Review and Outlook
EC Kudos

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

When this year’s Executive Committee was elected
last spring, many questioned the Committee’s poten-
tial effectiveness. They had reason to be skeptical
—only two of the EC’s 10 members had prior EC ex-
perience.

Last week, the Executive Committee, under Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein, demonstrated that experience is
not necessarily a prerequisite to good government.

Budget hearings and allocations often show the
stuff of which an Executive Committee is made, and
if that is the case this year, the 1983-84 EC does indeed
have a significant amount of potential.

The EC had $108,000 in student taxes to work with
but $172,000 in requests for funds from the various stu-
dent organizations.

Complicating the matter was the fact that this was
a Mock Convention year, and the Mock Convention re-
quested over $13,000 in student taxes.

But this year’s EC was not fazed. Two significant
changes in the format of the budget hearings and
deliberations led to a more thorough review of each
organization’s request and a more comprehensive
decision-making process.

In previous years, the EC had made a decision on
each organization’s allocation immediately after the
organization had defended its request and answered
questions from the committee members. This often
led to confusion on the part of EC members, who did
not really have ample time to study each request
before casting a vote.

That problem was alleviated last week by the EC’s
not making any decisions until all organizations had
defended their requests.

When the time for those decisions rolled around
Thursday evening, the second major change became
apparent. The finance subcommittee, consisting of
vice-president Dave Judge, upperclass law represen-
tative Jim Green and senior class representative Jim
Messer, had reviewed and discussed each request
—apparently often at great length — and made a
recommendation to the EC.

It would be difficult to challenge the validity of
these recommendations because 12 of the 18 were ap-
proved by the entire committee. Debate on many of
the organizations’ requests was surprisingly brief, as
EC members had been able to review each request.

Whether the EC made the correct decisions in the
allocation of funds is a moot point. What is important
is that this year’s EC has made noticeable strides
toward simplifying what used to be a_ tedious
budgeting process.

And from that we can hope that even better things
are tocome.

Phi reporting questioned

To the Editors:

Racism lives at W&L, subtly.

Two weeks ago in the Ring-
tum Phi, there were two reports
about assaults on students. A
pair of W&L students had been
beaten up in Lexington and a
freshman from Randolph-
Macon Women’s College had
been raped at a W&L fraternity
house.

None of the suspects in the
crimes, the Phi told us, were
W&L students. In addition, all
of the assailants, it told us just
as matter of factly, were black.
Last Thursday a follow-up story
on the assault on the two W&L
students again identified the
suspects as black.

Including the suspect’s race
in the stories was unnecessary
— it accomplished nothing
other than stirring up racial
tension and reinforcing old
stereotypes.

Does the Phi make it a
regular policy to identify people
who appear in its news columns
by the color of their skin? Cer-
tainly not if they’re white. Had
the assailants been white,
would the Phi have described
them by their race? I don’t
think so.

kKkkk

The Ring-tum Phi invites
readers to submit letters to the
Editors but reserves the right
to edit letters provided the
meaning remains unchanged.
Letters to the Editors are not
the stated views of the Ring-
tum Phi or its editors but sole-
ly those of the letter’s author.

The two incidents were
vicious, inexcusable criminal
acts directed at college students
by, apparently, non-students.
The race of those involved had
nothing to do with the issue and,
unless it could have shown some
compelling reason to include
racial descriptions, the Phi
should have left them out.

Almost all newspapers make
it a policy not to identify people

by their race unless it is rele-
vant to the subject. If, for in-
stance, two black firefighters
sue the City of Roanoke for
discrimination in its promotion
practices, their race is certain-
ly relevant. But in most stories,
identification by race is not
necessary.

There was a time, not too
many years ago, when this

Time for discussion

By BEN HALE

Nhen the editor discussed the
ssibility of a column with me,
iad no idea how difficult it
uld be to focus on a par-
ular topic that could benefit
least most readers. I had sug-
stions for every topic from
esident Wilson’s wardrobe to
an Atwoods’ office shower in
: C-School blueprints. I have
tled, however, on a couple of
ngs that ought to be on our
nds these days — perhaps
re strongly than they
eady are.
n last week’s Ring-tum Phi
‘re was an article on page 4
yorting Student Body Vice
asident David Judge’s im-
ssions from the Alumni
ird of directors meeting.
less Mr. Judge is dramati-
ly exaggerating the board’s
itiments, the report should
woke some serious interest
Jaction from us.
ividently the issue of
iducation is coming to a head
h the alumni; students
uld make their opinions
ywn. This is a_ heavily
cussed issue. Its importance,
vever, remains the same.
are is no issue more rooted in
marrow of W&L. We should
let the alumni make a

recommendation to the Board
of Trustee without letting the
alumni with whom we are ac-
quainted know our feelings.

In Monday’s’ Richmond
Times-Dispatch, President
Wilson is quoted as saying:

“‘T want to put the question of
coeducation to rest by May ...
one way or another. I will either
ask the Board of Trustees to ap-
prove a change or tell them that
we should remain all male at
the undergraduate level.”’

This is definite language — no
vague rumor — about the im-
mediacy of the issue. This is
serious talk about the most
serious change of all. Please

don’t discuss it as a rumbling in
OTOL

My View

the distance. President Wilson
has met with the faculty and
outlined procedures for incor-
porating student opinion. By all
means let us cooperate.
According to the Voting
Regulations Board, there will
already have been a student
referendum by the time this is
published.
It’s regretful that the Ex-
ecutive Committee felt the need

 

to rush this. It should have been
disconnected with other elec-
tions and well publicized. But if
you didn’t vote, here is more
motivation for you to speak out
in other ways.

The other point of concern
from Judge’s report was the
statement on Fraternities. If
the phrases: ‘embarrassment
to the university”? and “rock
bottom’’ accurately reflect the
Alumni board’s sentiments, we
should be stirred. The alumni
are the main channel for any
funds outside of dues.

President Wilson met with the
IFC Thursday evening and gave
a lengthy speech outlining the
already well-known pros and
cons of the fraternity system as
it is now. His speech was,
however, a way of putting the
ball in the IFC’s court. He made
it somewhat clear that he’d like
nothing better than seeing the
fraternities straighten them-
selves out. If the fraternities
analyze their own problems
(e.g. run-down structures, sag-
ging alumni relations, com-
munity relations, etc.) and take
measures to solve these pro-
blems, administrative legisla-
tion will not be necessary. We
should appreciate this oppor-
tunity and act accordingly.

 

 

Letter

(continued from page 2)

wasn’t always true in the South.
Photographs of blacks were not
used to illustrate routine news
stories and news about the
black community was
regulated to the ‘‘Negro News’’
sections. In fact, about the only
sure way for a black to get in
the newspaper was to commit a
crime against ‘‘law-abiding’’
whites. And, of course, the
criminal’s race was played up,
reinforcing prejudices and fur-
ther adding to the indignities of
living in a segregated society.

The reporters who wrote the
articles probably didn’t include
the information as intentional
racial slaps. Their actions,
however, were thoughtless ex-
amples of the subtle kinds of
prejudice that still vex blacks
long after the demise of Jim
Crow laws.

A newspaper has a respon-
sibility to print the news ac-
curately and fairly. The stories
were accurate, but biased. In
this case, irresponsibly.

ritics of Congressional

ieve the apparent
elessness in spending and

budgeting can find its roots in
college days.

Three student groups which
receive sizeable grants from
the EC were bleeding their
hearts last Thursday night, beg-

past

and budgeting.

Witness the ‘‘Calyx,’” the
undergraduate yearbook. Last
year’s business manager
FORGOT to bill advertisers
$5,000. How one could forget
money — especially $5,000
—that was due him I’ll never
know. While the ‘‘Calyx’”’
received all but $500 of its re-
quest ($11,500), the fact re-
mains the yearbook will be
responsible this year for a stu-
dent’s carelessness with stu-
dent activity funds last year.

Then there was last year’s
business manager for the Ring-
tum Phi. Upperclassmen will
remember last year’s paper
had a full-page advertisement
on the back page for every
issue. The page, worth $165 was
sold to an advertiser for $130
provided the ad ran every issue.
At the end of the year, with a
contract signed earlier promis-
ing payment and a $1,690 debt

by the advertiser to the paper,
some think the business
manager offered a ‘‘deal’’ with
the ‘suddenly broke’’ adver-
tiser for payment of $1,120 and
no further obligations. The con-
tract was not found at the begin-
ning of this year. This was a loss
to the paper of over $500 be-
cause one student may have
been eager to leave campus.
(Additionally, the ad _ upset
other competing stores so that
future advertisements in the
paper have been hurt.)

Finally there was the Mock
Convention. They received
$10,000 in EC funds, far short of
the $13,632 they had hoped for
and only $1,500 above what had
been promised them last year.
The Convention’s budget man
cried the blues about low cash
flows and great expenses. His
cries fell on deaf ears, and
rightfully so. The cash flow pro-
blems stem from a misunder-

standing about a bond’s due
date (somehow $6,000 will not
be available for spending until
nearly four months after the
Convention) and the Conven-
tion’s Finance Committee’s in-
ability to raise funds from cor-
porate sponsors by the assigned
time.

In fact the Finance Committee
met only once last spring.

Cry, weep and gnash their
teeth as they may, each of these
groups is shedding bitter tears.
It is not the responsibility of the
EC to pay for students’ mis-
takes, carelessness, or follies.
The EC does not appropriate
student funds -—parents’
money, in most cases — for fun
and frivolity. Rather, funds are
given organizations with the ex-
pectation that they will be
handled and spent judiciously.
Begging for more money when
past spending habits show
carelessness is begging in vain.

Kennedy speaks to
conservative crowd

at Liberty Baptist

By TODD SMITH
Staff Reporter

Introduced to a gym full of
conservative Liberty Baptist
College students as ‘Mr.
Democrat and Mr. Liberal,”
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-
Mass.) made a _ relatively
painless trip through the lion’s
den Monday night.

Despite the controversial
mix-up that brought him as a
speaker to the college founded
by Moral Majority leader, the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, Kennedy’s
speech on religious toleration in
politics received a polite stand-

ing ovation. Kennedy took only
screened questions from stu-
dents and none from the large
group of Washington and
regional reporters, as both he
and Falwell sought to avoid a
repeat of the jeering that
Falwell received when speak-
ing earlier this year at Harvard
University.

On the contrary, the mood
was congenial. After breaking
bread with Kennedy, Falwell
said, ‘We'll probably like each
other better now.’”’ And Ken-
nedy began his speech joking
that he had arranged with
Falwell ‘to permit all the

students an extra hour next
Saturday night before curfew.
And, in return, I have promised
to watch the Old Time Gospel
Hour next Sunday night.”

Kennedy, a Roman Catholic,
spoke for the separation of
church and state, and cautioned
women and men “of deep
religious faith’ against the
temptation “to misuse govern-
ment in order to impose a value
which they cannot persuade
others to accept.

“Once we succumb to that
temptation, we step onto a slip-
pery slope where everyone’s
freedom is at risk,’’ Kennedy
said. ‘‘Those who favor censor-
ship should recall that one of the
first books ever burned was the
first English translation of the
Bible.

“T respectfully suggest that
God has taken no position on the
Department of Education —and
that a balanced budget constitu-
tional amendment is a matter
for economic analysis, not
heavenly appeals,” Kennedy
said.

But aside from these barbs
pointed at the conservative
Moral Majority, Kennedy
quoted the apostle Paul and ap-
pealed to his critics: ‘‘As fellow
citizens, let us live peaceably
with each other.”

“Dr. Falwell is not a ‘war-
monger’ — and ‘liberal
clergymen’ are not, as the
Moral Majority suggested in a
recent letter, equivalent to
‘Soviet sympathizers’.”’

It is because Kennedy has
signed onto conservative mail-
ing lists, and receives letters
like the one referred to that he
received a plastic Moral Ma-
jority membership card.

“The long and the short of it
was, a letter went to the senator
saying, why don’t you come
down and speak to us, and just
that quickly — and not a sur-
prise as I heard on ABC last
night — he accepted,” Falwell
said Monday.

A Falwell aide, however, said
that he invited Kennedy only as
an afterthought in a_ light
apology for sending Kennedy a
membership card. When Ken-
nedy accepted, the aide told the
New York Times, Falwell turn-
ed white as a sheet and said,
‘What?’ ”

Although the campus chapter
of the Young Americans for
Freedom reportedly distributed
pamphlets with Kennedy’s
voting record on_ abortion,
homosexual rights and the
nuclear freeze, there were no
signs of student dissent Monday
night.

Kennedy took questions about

his views on the Democratic

nomination for President and
nuclear arms from a_ pre-
selected, neatly dressed group
of politics majors — five men
first, then three women.

Sharolyn Schrodt, a Liberty
Baptist junior said she heard
some ‘‘people who were
swayed” by Kennedy ‘“‘being in-
terviewed saying, ‘yeah, he was
all right, he quoted Scrip-
ture.’ ”’

“‘We’re glad he came to speak
here, but he didn’t say
anything.”’ she said.

EC chops $64,00C

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

“If we’re going to have to cut
your budget, where should we
cut?” Executive Committee
President Bob Jenevein asked
Ron Magee, president of the
Student Association for Black
Unity, at last week’s budget
hearings.

‘‘Whew...”’ responded Magee,
echoing the response of many of
the other 15 organizations who’d
requested money from the EC.

When it was all over at 11:30
Thursday night, the EC had
pared budget requests of over
$172,000 down to $108,961.77

Two organizations, Excelsior
and the Outdoor Club, did not
receive any money. Excelsior
had requested $900 to publish
three four-page issues, while
the Outdoor Club had agreed
previously to be incorporated
into the Student Activities
Board.

Only two organizations, the
Hockey Club and the Ariel, had
their requests granted. Every
other organization had its re-
questreduced. _

This year’s hearings were
marked by two format changes.
First, deliberations were held
after all clubs had defended
their requests. And in a move
that sped up the process some-
what, all requests were review-
ed by a finance subcommittee,
consisting of Vice-President
Dave Judge, law rep Jim Green
and senior rep Jim Messer.

The finance committee re-
viewed each budget and made a
recommendation to the EC as to
how much money each
organization should receive.
For 12 of the 19 requests
(including EC expenses and EC
funding), the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation was
approved by the EC, often
unanimously and frequently
with little debate.

On four occasions, the EC
raised the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation, and
twice that recommendation was
reduced.

Following is a breakdown of
the organizations’ requests to
the EC and the points around
which debate centered. The
organizations are listed accord-
ing to how much money each
received.

e¢ Student Activities Board.
The SAB requested $61,288 in
what Jenevein described ‘‘an
impressive request.’’ Most of
that money, $36,612, would have
been spent on entertainment,
with the University Center
Committee taking up $17,693.
The finance subcommittee
recommended the SAB receive
$42,000, which was approved
unanimously by the EC. “‘It
almost feels like we’re penaliz-
ing you for doing such a good
job last year,” Judge said.

¢ Student Bar Association.
The SBA’s request of $25,540
represented 102 percent of the

law school’s contribution to s
dent taxes. Last year’s S)
received 72 percent of that c:
tribution. The finance subco
mittee recommended that |
SBA receive 80 percent,

$17,907. Law rep Jim Green p
posed that the amount be rais
to 82 percent, or $18,354.67,
amount approved unanimou
by the EC. Also, the SB:

for the Convention’s request.

The finance subcommittee
recommended $10,000, or
$1,687.10 over what the Board of
Trustees had mandated. That
amount was approved unani-
mously by the EC, with Jene-
vein saying, ‘“‘We’re without
alternatives. We don’t have

tion of the Interfraternity Coun-
cil, Contact is now funded by
both the EC and the IFC. They
requested $13,000 from the EC
to go with $8,000 from the IFC to
sponsor six speakers. ‘‘We’re
facing a big problem this year
in that speaker prices have just
gone through the wall,’’ Gov
Slahor said.

“Why the decision to hit the
EC for 13 [thousand dollars]
and the IFC for only eight?”
asked Secretary Len Howard.
“Is it really fair for the EC to
foot the larger portion of the
bill?”

Sophomore rep James White
said, ‘‘The IFC obviously isn’t
taking a whole lot of respon-
sibility here in funding it.”’

The finance subcommittee’s
recommendation of $9,400 pass-
ed 91, with Howard voting
against. Howard said the EC
should give Contact that much
only if the IFC agreed to match
it.

eAriel. “‘Of all the requests
we’ve seen, I think the Ariel is
the most bare-bones request,”
Howard said. Editor Rick
Swagler’s request for $1,800 to
publish two issues was approv-
ed by the EC, even though the
finance subcommittee’s recom-
mendation had been $1,200.

e Student Association for
Black Unity. SABU’s $5,100 re-
quest included $3,000 for two
speakers. ‘‘We couldn’t really

 

¢ Contact. Originally a crea-

see a place for that,’’ Judge
said. His subcommittee’s rec-
ommendation of $1,500 was ap-
proved unanimously.

e Film Society. The Film
Society had requested $3,000 in
order to show 12 films this year,
instead of the usual eight. That
request was denied by the EC,
though, which, at the recom-
mendation of the finance sub-
committee, gave the Film
Society $1,200 on an 8-2 vote.

¢ International CLub. The In-
ternational Club received the

‘same amount as they did last

year, $1,050, which was also the
finance subcommittee’s recom-

* mendation. During the hear-

ings, vice-president Nelson Pat-
terson questioned how many
students would be willing to pay
dues to the club but said about
60 attended the club’s first

~ meeting of the year.

¢ Fencing Club. ‘We have
some really dedicated people
and they need your support,”

+ Dr. James Worth told the EC in

requesting $1,200. The athletic
department had turned down
the club’s request for varsity

~ status because of a lack of

money. The EC gave the club

~ $1,000, as per the finance sub-

committee’s recommendation.
“They’re really pushing to try
to make that an NCAA sport

and we’d hate to see them fall
apart,’’ Judge said.

e Political Review. The
Political Review, which has

gained membership in the Pub-

lications Board for a trial

~ period of three months, asked

for $1,800 to produce two issues.
When the finance subcom-
mittee’s recommendation of
$1,000 was announced, Editor
Mike Singer said he only needed
$850 to put out one issue and
asked for the EC’s promise that
if the first issue were good, a se-
cond issue be funded.

“That shows a very selfless
interest in the student body, and
we appreciate that and will
keep it in mind,’’ Jenevein said.
The $850 was approved unani-
mously.

eRugby Club. About 30-35
students participate in this
club, Herb Funsten said, and
each pays $15 in dues as well as

paying their own traveling ex-
penses and buying their own
uniforms. The club’s request of
$880 included $490 for member-
ship in the Virginia Rugby
Union, a 300 percent increase in
those dues since last year. The
finance subcommittee’s recom-
mendation of $830 was approved
unanimously.

¢ Hockey Club. With less than
a minute of debate, the EC ap-
proved the Hockey Club’s $390
request. Each member of the
club msut pay $25 in dues, and
the biggest expense is ice time
at $65 an hour.

e Frisbee Club. The Frisbee
Club’s $535 request included
money for the purchase of 30
frisbees, transportation and
tournament fees. The finance
subcommittee recommended
$265, with Judge saying, ‘“Some
people have raised questions
that in the Frisbee Club, the in-
dividual members put in very
little.” The EC cut the request
even further to $100, an amount
approved by the slimmest
margin, 6-4, of the evening.

e Excelsior. Excelsior was
formed with the idea that a
symposium would be held every
four years on a pressing na-
tional or international topic.
Chris Fulton, editor, told the
EC, “basically, we’re bagging
the symposium and the White
Paper.”’

Excelsior proposed to publish
three four-page issues as in-
serts to the Ring-tum Phi at a
cost of $900. ‘“‘My problem,”
said Jenevein, “‘is that I’m not
sure that there is some interest
in Excelsior.”

Chairman Steve Keros,
defending the publication, said,
“It’s the ‘intellectual journal’ of
the school. This is a college-
university, and there’s almost
nothing like it.”

The EC decided unanimously
to put Excelsior ‘‘in a state of
financial hold mainly due to a
lack of funds.’’

¢ Outing Club. The Outing
Club has been disbanded, and
the Student Activities Board
will oversee distribution and
maintenance of the equipment.

The EC will take a final vote
on the budget at 7 tonight.

Grads return for seminar

The Washington and Lee
University placement office
will present a panel discussion
titled ‘‘The World of Work”’ on
Wednesday, Oct. 12, featuring
three W&L graduates from the
field of commercial banking.

The panel will initiate a series
of six discussion seminars on
varying professional areas, ac-
cording to Michael A. Cappeto,
associate dean of students and
director of placement at W&L.

Cappeto, who has planned the
seminars in conjunction with
Stephen P. Bredin, W&L place-
ment consultant, said the series
reflects a more aggressive
policy of seeking placement for
W&L students.

“T think there is a need to
establish a program like this,”’
Cappetto said.

He added that when he made
a request for a placement con-
sultant last spring, university
administrators and faculty
‘wholeheartedly approved.”

Bredin, former director of
placement for the University of
Virginia business school, will
work with Cappeto in an effort
to increase the number of re-
cruiters 4t W&L as well as the
involvement of corporations on
the W&L campus.

Bredin said he will strive to
achieve the ‘“‘total involve-
ment” of large companies and
corporations in the areas of

development, research and en-
dowment.

Bredin added that the pro-
gram was also designed to raise
liberal arts students’ awareness
to the availability of jobs in
business.

“The idea, in effect, is to say
to students that the world of
business and government is
fun,’’ Bredin said, ‘‘because it
uses all sorts of skills.”’

“TI guess what I’m trying to
say is that you don’t have to
have five courses in accounting
to get into banking,”’ he said.

‘‘You hear all this about the
poor liberal arts gradu-
ate...well, that ain’t so,”’ Bredin
explained.

The seminar on banking will
presnt James Matthews, (W&L
70) +~vice-president, Private
Banking and Investment Divi-
sion, Citibank, New York City,
N.Y.;Robert Brookby, (W&L
72) +~+vice-president National
Banking, Wachovia Bank and
Trust Company, Winston-
Salem, N.C.; Frank Brower,
(W&L ’82) Management
associate, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Company, New York Ci-
ty, N.Y.

Other seminars will include
investment banking, govern-
ment services, marketing and
advertising, manufacturing and
high technology, Bredin said.

Generals sting Yellow Jack

Oe ee 7 mre

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee quarter-
back Bobby Wilson scored on a
three-yard run with :59 remain-
ing in the game to give the
Generals a hard earned, crucial
28-21 victory over the Randolph-
Macon Yellow Jackets last
Saturday.

Wilson’s run capped off a 13-
play, 78 yard drive that began
after R-MC had tied the score at
21-21 with 6:53 to play.

Head coach Gary Fallon ex-
pected, and got, a tough game
from the Yellow Jackets.

“We weren’t surprised by
what we found down at Ran-
dolph-Macon. We had expected
to find a winless football team
that would be very hungry for
its first win. That’s exactly
what we found,” Fallon said.

Washington and Lee jumped
to an early lead when tailback
Gene Girard dove in the end
zone from one yard out. James
White converted the first of his
four PAT’s on the day and W&L
led 7-0 with five minutes re-
maining in the first quarter.

Randolph-Macon retaliated
with a pair of second quarter
scores, a 33-yard run by Alan

Wright and a one-yard plunge
by Andrew Tate, giving the
Yellow Jackets a 14-7 lead. This
lead soon vanished as QB
Wilson hit split end Dave
Sizemore for a_ four-yard
touchdown pass just 17 seconds
before intermission. After
White’s kick, the score was tied.
But the Generals had momen-
tum on their side going into the
locker room at the half.

The Generals regained the
lead midway through the third
quarter when Gene Girard’s
fumble was recovered in the
endzone by offensive tackle Pat
O’Connell. W&L held this 21-14
lead until R-MC’s Andrew Tate
scored his second touchdown of
the day on a one-yard run. Cody
Dearing added the point after,
making the score 21-21 with 6:53
remaining in the game.

Wilson then took control as he
led the Generals down the field,
completing several key third
down passes to keep the drive
alive. Wilson scored the win-
ning touchdown on a three-yard
run, making the final score,
28-21.

Coach Fallon once again had
praise for Wilson’s play.

“Bobby continues to improve
as we go along,” Fallon stated.

‘‘What I like is that he has not
been rattled. Even though he
threw two interceptions at
Macon, he didn’t let those
bother him.”

Defensively, Fallon singled
out free safety Chris Wilson.
Wilson, a sophomore from Sal-
isbury, Md., is filling in for in-
jured Bob Jenevein. Fallon add-
ed that he ‘‘continues to be im-
pressed with our defensive
secondary. They’ve played
tough football all year.”’

The Generals (2-1, 1-1 ODAC)
entertain the Maryville College
Scots (1-2, 1-2 ODAC) at Wilson
Field this Saturday. According
to Fallon, the Scots are ‘‘some-
thing of an unknown for us be-
cause this is the first year for
their coach (Bobby Saylor).
When you put a new personality
into a situation, you don’t really
have a feel for a team. We do
expect Maryville to be very
disciplined and to be a sound
team fundamentally.”’

Fallon also talked of the com-
placency his team must avoid.
‘‘We cannot rest on last week’s
laurels,” he warned. ‘‘If we do
that, Maryville could run us
right into the ground.”’

last Wednesday’s 2-1 victory
over Mary Washington.

Yesterday’s loss put the
Generals out of the race for the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association title, according to
head coach Rolf Piranian. Of
the title race in the ODAC, Pira-
nian said, ‘‘We’re not out of it,
but (this loss) certainly didn’t
help.’”’ The Generals are 0-2 in
VISA, 1-2 in the ODAC, and 3-2
overall.

The Generals appeared to
take the lead over Roanoke 27
minutes into the game when
junior Mark Sullivan headed in
a Gary Clements free kick from
the right side, but it was
disallowed by the referee, leav-
ing the first half scoreless.

Sullivan had to wait until the
second half to get his second
goal of the season, but by then
the Maroons were up, 2-0, add-
ing another near the end of the
game for the 3-1 final score.

On Saturday the Generals
traveled to Maryville, Tenn.,
and came away with their se-
cond shutout of the season, a 2-0
victory over ODAC opponent
Maryville College.

Piranian descirbed the game
as ‘‘totally dominated by us.’’
W&L out shot Maryville, 40-3.

The first goal came three
minutes into the game when a
penalty kick of Roland Simon
rebounded to sophomore for-
ward Steve McGrath, who pun-
ched it home for a 1-0 lead.

The Generals kept up the at-
tack but could not score the rest
of the half. “‘They were a very
physical team, and that took us
out of our game plan a little,”
Piranian commented.

The constant pressure paid
off twenty minutes into the se-
cond half when junior Gary
Clements scored the Generals’
second goal.

General goalkeeper Jay
Werner recorded his second
shutout of the season against
Maryville, collecting three
saves and Player of the Game
honors.

Polo, Killer Bs win big

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee var-
sity water polo team went
undefeated (3-0) last weekend
to win the W&L Generals Invita-
tional water polo tournament.
The tournament was played at
the Cy Twombly Pool. The three
victories stretched the
Generals’ overall record to 10-5.

Head water polo coach Page
Remillard stated, “The high-
light of the weekend was that
the A team, as a unit, started to
develop an offensive and defen-
sive rhythm.” He continued, ‘‘I
am very happy about this
weekend. Everything is star-
ting to fall together.”’

The B team also had a suc-
cessful weekend. The en-
thusiasm displayed by the B
team has earned them the
nickname “Killer Bs.” The
“Killer Bs” picked up their first
win of the season when they
defeated George Washington
University by a score of 9-8. Jay
Re Ville scored the winning goal
for the Generals with seven
seconds remaining in the game.
Commenting on the B team’s
performance, Remillard said,
‘“‘We’re maturing right on time.
We're getting ready.”

Coach Remillard believes
that all of his players are play-
ing well. He cited Bobby Pear-

son and Don Smith for outstand-
ing individual performances on
the A team. He also commend-
ed David Lewis for outstanding
play as a member of the B
team.

Remillard mentioned that all
four of his goalies have improv-
ed more quickly than he thought
that they could have improved
at the beginning of the season.
He believes that the leadership
of senior goalie Kevin Kadesky
has produced this improve-
ment.

Concerning the entire team’s
progress, Remillard stated,
‘“‘All season our improvement
has been depending on the im-
provement of the freshmen. If
we beat Richmond at the
Southern League Champion-
ships it will be the result of the
B team’s improvement.’’
Remillard believes that the B
team needs to follow up last

weekend’s success with more
successful play this weekend.
“‘We need the same results this
weekend,’’ he said.

The Generals will host the
Southern League (Zone I) Tour-
nament this weekend on Oct. 8
and 9. Teams from James
Madison University, George
Washington University, Lynch-
burg College and VMI will par-
ticipate in the tournament.
W&L will enter a B team in ad-
dition to the varsity squad. The
teams will compete at the Cy
Twombly Pool.

Remillard will work on
generating offense and han-
dling special situations this
week in preparation for the
tournament. Regarding the
tournament, Remillard said,
‘We don’t know what JMU has,
but we will be ready. I hope that
we repeat our performance
from last week.”

Remember,
sports are only games

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

..If you’ve ever gotten up
early on a Saturday morning
(Yeah, I love pretend games,
too) and taken a walk over by
the law school field, you might
be able to catch a glimpse of
what athletic competition was
originally intended to be. It’s
some sort of community youth
soccer league whose _par-
ticipants are a half century
away from worrying about
retirement benefits. Indeed,
they are relative light years
away from worrying about
anything other than whether to
wear their blue or their white
wristbands. Why so much in-
terest in little league soccer?
Perhaps, these youngsters
reminded me of what sports
should be, namely games for
games’ sake. Not a startling
revelation, you say? Maybe so,
but just look where the real
world of sports has gone of late.
That world seems a bit
disordered when compared
with the world of the law school
field. No contract disputes here.
No coaches on the verge of be-
ing fired. No steroids. No win or
die philosophy. No cocaine or
alcohol problems (hence no
chemical dependency con-
sultants, either). No boycotts or
bannings. And no prima donnas
looking for glory and excuses.
Of course not, you say, they’re
just kids. No, I say, they’re just
games...

Street, was in one of the craft’s
rear seats at the time of the
crash.

Professor Emmons’ wife
learned of the accident from
friends Tuesday afternoon
when she returned from an ex-
amination in Atlanta.

She said her husband had suf-
fered a ‘“‘crushed ankle,’’ and
that “‘plates were put in the
ankle to replace the broken
bones.”’ She said he suffered
“severe facial lacerations’”’ and
had undergone plastic surgery.

 

Ford

(continued from page 1)

Ford also spoke out against
the continuing increases in
government welfare policies
that began in the 1960s.

“This trend has worried me
as I saw it developing as a
member of Congress and as
President,”’ he said. ‘‘More and
more, individuals become
dependent on government hand-
outs.

‘“‘A government big enough to
give us everything we want is a
government big enough to take
from us everything we have,”
he added, as the audience inter-
rupted his address with ap-
plause for the first of five times.

Ford was interrupted by ap-
plause again when he said, “‘I
strongly support President
Reagan’s military program.”

He called for the U.S. to build
100 B-1 bombers, modify the
MX missile program, acceler-
ate the cruise missile program
and modernize and expand all
military forces.

“If we do this,” Ford said,
‘‘all of us can feel the U:S. is
meeting its leadership respon-
sibilities in this area.

‘Peace through strength is a
sound policy; weakness invites
aggression and it invites op-

pression.”’
Paraphrasing Winston
Churchill, Ford said,

“Democracy is the worst form
of government in the history of
mankind, except it’s better than
any other that’s ever been
tried.”’

over the ’skins, and on Monday
night Pittsburgh over Cincin-
nati. He comments further on
the pro football scene, saying,
with regard to his AFC East
choice the Jets, ‘‘Their perfor-
mance without McNeil was im-
pressive.’’ (I don’t know if he
was talking about Monday night
or Studio 54). About the Giants,
the royal soothsayer sees an
out-break of Expos disease.
Says He that knows all,
“There’s no way their defense
should give up 41 points to Air
Sickness Coryell.” Finally, he
has those playoff picks you’re
waiting for. The royal word:
‘In a short series, the team that
gets the pitching and makes the
fewest errors usually wins. It’s
a toss-up, but I like Chicago in
five and Philadelphia in four.”’
Remember, you heard it here
first...Er, then again...

only that bastion of sports jour-
nalism The Washington Post
can give us three ‘“‘rah rah”
stories on the Redskins on a
Tuesday...
