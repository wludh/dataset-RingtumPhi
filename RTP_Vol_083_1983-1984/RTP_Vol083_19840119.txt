EC to vote on exam policy

Committee also defends policy on withdrawls

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Washington and Lee students
will be able to take exams dur-
ing any exam period without
specifying a day and time on
their exam envelopes if a pro-
posal presented at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting is approved by the
faculty.

Junior representative Cole
Dawson, presenting his findings
on the possible open exam
policy, said, ‘‘I think it will be
very good and very well receiv-
ed.”’

The EC will vote Monday on
whether to recommend
Dawson’s proposal to the Facul-
ty Executive Committee.

Dawson’s proposal consists of
the following major points:

— Students must hand in ex-
am envelopes with their name,
course and professor’s name to
their professor by 4:30 p.m. on

the Wednesday preceding ex-
ams. A student who fails to
meet that deadline will not be
allowed to take a Saturday ex-
am unless he receives an ex-
emption from his professor.

— Students are not required
to specify a date and time for an
exam on their envelope; nor do
they have to notify their pro-
fessor of the date and time.

— The same exam times (9
a.m.-noon and 2 p.m.-5 p.m.)
still will apply.

— The EC must pledge the
services of four or five students
per exam time (i.e. — twice a
day, 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.) to help
the secretaries in the Com-
merce School, history depart-
ment and math department
distribute exams. Executive
Committee members, Universi-
ty Council members and class
officers will share that respon-
sibility.

The Faculty EC will make a
recommendation on the plan to

Grand jury calls Jenevein
in local drug investigation

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Robert C. Jenevein
testified last Thursday before
the special grand jury in-
vestigating drug use in Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

University President John D.
Wilson and Dean of Students
Lewis G. John have also been
subpoenaed by the panel.

Commonwealth’s Attorney
John Read told Jenevein that he
had been called in connection
with his role as president of the
Washington and Lee student
body. r

The special grand jury, which
convened on Nov. 2 and has
since had nine other sessions,
was created by Circuit Court

the faculty as a whole during its
regular meeting Feb. 6. If the
faculty approves the plan, it
would go into effect for this
term’s exams, Dawson said.

Scott Mason, a _ junior
representative to last year’s
EC, initiated the study, which
Dawson was appointed to con-
tinue this year. ‘

Also Monday night, the EC
announced that, following the
receipt of letters from the law
school administration and an
executive session last week, it
had decided not to change its
policy regarding withdrawals in
the face of an honor violation
charge. A student who with-
draws after being charged with
an honor violation is no longer
considered in good standing
with the university.

‘“‘A student would not really
consider withdrawal in the face
of an honor violation unless he
had committed an honor viola-

(continued on page 12)

Judge George E. Honts III in
response to a request from
Read.

Read’s motion had been en-
dorsed by Lexington Police

Chief L.O. Sutton and
Rockbridge Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds.

At the time, Honts said the
nine jurors’ purpose was ‘‘to in-
vestigate drug trafficking and
certain other criminal activity
in this community.”

Special grand juries in
Virginia do not indict, but in-
stead issue recommendations to
a regular grand jury. According
to the Commonwealth code, the
jurors have subpoena power
and can cite witnesses for per-
jury and for contempt.

As with all grand juries, the
testimony is secret.

Clerk of Court Bruce Patter-
son said that this is the first
special grand jury in this area
in memory. He said the best in-
dications are that the last one
was in the 1920s.

According to records made
available by Patterson, Jene-
vein is currently the only W&L
student to have received a sum-
mons from the grand jury.

Among the 80 names released
are several VMI cadets. A few
of the people called have

testified more than once. In ad-
dition, a number of juveniles,
mostly from Lexington High
School, have testified, but their
names were not made public.

Former W&L students Wil-
liam L. Dederick, Marc A. Ham
and Thomas J. Rohrig, all of
whom have been convicted of
drug possession, have appeared
before the panel. The three are
serving suspended sentences
and are on ten years’ probation.

VMI Superintendent Sam S.
Walker and Commandant of
Cadets Harold B. Snyder Jr.
have been subpeonaed.

Walker said in a statement
obtained through his office that
he was unable to testify last
Thursday as originally schedul-
ed, and that his appearance had
been postponed.

Dean John said that his ap-
pearance has been rescheduled
for Jan. 27, and Wilson was ex-
pected to testify today.

Jenevein said that prior to his
appearance he expected that
they would ask him ‘about
honor system proceedings and
who we’ve dealt with in regard
to drugs.”’

“T can’t think of any other
reason that they would have
called me,”’ he said.

ODK initiates 26 students
at annual convocation

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s Alpha Chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa, the
honorary fraternity for campus
leaders, held its annual inita-
tion, or ‘“‘tap day,’ ceremonies
during the Founders’ Day con-
vocation today.

W&L President John D.
Wilson delivered the principal
address for the convocation pro-
gram.

During the _ initiation
ceremonies, 26 W&L law and
undergraduate students were
“tapped” into membership in

the fraternity along with
Washington and Lee Dean
William J. Watt and three pro-
minent alumni of the university
— J. Carter Fox of West Point,
Va.; W. Hayne Hipp of Green-
ville, S.C.; and William J.
Wilcox Jr. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.

ODK was founded at Wash-
ington and Lee in 1914 and
recognizes superior leadership
achievements in various areas
of campus life.

Review and Outlook

 

Honor and the Law

In calling Washington and Lee Student Body Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein before his special drug grand jury
last Thursday, Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly C.
“John” Read came dangerously close to opening a
conflict with numerous and monumental repercus-
sions.

In an effort to crack down on the major drug
distributors in the Rockbridge area, Read has formed
a grand jury to investigate drug trafficking which in-
evitably intersects with the W&L community. But by
tapping a witness for testimony without concrete
reasoning that he has valuable knowledge about drug
trafficking, Read has seemingly taken a stray step.

In calling Jenevein for testimony merely because
he is the student body president, Read and the of-
ficials behind the grand jury have come uncomfor-
tably close to clashing Virginia State law and the
Washington and Lee Honor System. As president of
the student body and the Executive Committee, Jene-
vein is entrusted with an honor code which transcends
law and consequently he is expected to hold that code
in complete confidentiality.

Although that confidentiality was not threatened
Thursday, Jenevein could have potentially been pos-
ed with the choice of being cited and charged for con-
tempt of court for an attempt to uphold the integrity
of the Honor System or exposing to public view an
Honor Code which has been Kept in reverent secrecy
for 119 years.

“I hope they’1l understand.” Jenevein said after the
testimony.

We also hope that such a confrontation does not
arise and apparently the honor system was not
threatened last week. But the grand jury is em-
powered to operate for four more months and as the
investigation heightens such a critically dangerous
situation could take place.

While Jenevein’s attitude is noble and loyal, such
qualities do not often hold up in a courtroom. It is
necessary for the University administration to take
action to ensure against such a disastrous choice. And
it is mandatory that the commonwealth’s attorney
limit his subpoenas to those who he is positive can of-
fer concrete and crucial evidence in the grand jury’s
investigation.

EEC function explained

To the Editors:

With all due respect to Mr.
Patterson and his article con-
cerning the Common Market
which appeared in last week’s
Phi, the common agricultural
policy of the E.E.C. does not
“pay farmers not to produce
above a given quantity.” To the
contrary it guarantees farmers
minimum prices for given pro-
ducts regardless of their sup-
ply. Although the guaranteed
price is below the expected
market price, this guaranty
nevertheless leads to a
misallocation of resources, that
is, overproduction in certain
sectors. This is one of the

negative aspects of CAP as it
presently exists.

The principal complaint of
Great Britain and West Ger-
many is their feeling that they
are getting an “unjust return”’
from the E.E.C. These two
countries and France are by far
the largest contributors to the
community’s budget which
grew at an average annual rate
of 24 percent from 1973 to 1981.
FEOGA (European Fund for
Agricultural Orientation and
Guaranties) is presently ac-
countable for approximately
two-thirds of the annual budget
expenditure. Due to the struc-
ture of their economics, Great

Britain and West Germany
each receive a small portion of
these funds and thus resent the
fact that they are making little
more than transfer payments to
those countries in the communi-
ty whose economies depend
more heavily on agricultural
production than do _ theirs.
However, a_ cost-benefit
analysis of the gains that in-
dividual member countries
have reaped from the communi-
ty’s agricultural policy is an in-
complete measure of the
benefits of economic integra-
tion.

IU details funding stand

To the Editors:

We would like to take this op-
portunity to expand upon Bruce
Potter’s article in last week’s
Phi, which concerned itself with
the Executive Committee’s
denial of the Independent
Union’s budget request.
However, we still feel that we
are entitled to EC funding and
would like to point out why.

First of all, the EC has an ac-
count called EC Funding, which
has a balance of $2,000. The pur-
pose of this account is two-fold,
1) to help those groups which
have a deficit, and 2) to help
new groups which missed the
first budget hearing. Since we
are a new group, we feel that we
are entitled to a portion of this
account.

Second, since every student
pays $70 a year on student tax-
es, we feel that those students
who belong to IU are entitled to

see their money used by an
organization in which they par-
ticipate.

Third, the EC claims that we
do not deserve money since
they perceive us as a fraternity
and the fraternities don’t get
any money from EC. Why then
did the EC allocate $1,500 to Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty?

» Fourth, the EC refused our
request because they feel we
cater to a narrow scope of the

EC must avoid prejudice in

dealing with independents

By SCOTT MASON
Phi Columnist

The Executive Committee
seems to have had a quiet year
so far. It hasn’t made any
heroic achievements but hasn’t
made any serious blunders
either. It appears to be doing its
job efficiently, and as long as it
continues to do so, there’s no
need for bold headlines. After
all, no news is goodnews.

But last week the EC stepped
out from under its shell and
very quickly throttled cries for
financial help uttered by the
newly-formed Independent
Union. The IU asked for more
than $600 — ‘‘hardware’”’ to get
the organization on its feet. It
didn’t get a cent.

It’s probably safe to say that
there’s a certain antagonism
that exists between fraternity
members and independents —
“goddamn independents” as
they’re commonly referred to
on the Hill. They’re seen as out-
casts in a fraternity-dominated
environment — guys who just
don’t fit in.

It’s ironic but also a little bit
disturbing that nine of the 10
undergraduate members of the
EC belong to fraternities. On
the surface, that may suggest
that the EC was biased when it
decided not to give the in-
dependents money. However,
the EC said its reason for refus-
ing the Independent Union’s re-
quest was the IU had not
previsouly informed the com-
mittee of its intentions to ask for
funds. Executive Committee
policy states that organizations

seeking funds must notify the
EC a week in advance. Further-
more, some EC members be-
lieved the IU would be better off
working strictly among
themselves.

To IU Chairmen Joe Cadle
and Jim Sarle, it must have
seemed as though their pro-
posal was doomed from the
start. It was probably like step-
ping into enemy territory; they
weren’t facing the EC, but
rather a bunch of fraternity
boys eager to gun down any
move by the ‘goddamn in-
dependents’’ to organize. Better
to keep the outcasts out than to

 

Reader’s
Advocate

give them a foot in the door of
the “elite” W&L social scene.
Whatever the independents’
feelings, EC President Bob
Jenevein assures the commit-
tee made its decision without
bias when it chose to reject the
IU’s plea for funds. “‘If there is
an antagonism between frater-
nity members and independ-
ents, I’m sure it played no role
in our decision “‘ Jenevein said.
The incident brings to light
the issue of objectivity, an issue
which not only the EC should be
aware of, but the Ring-tum Phi
as well. From the press’ point of
view, a reporter has a tough
job. He must report events ac-

 

curately without interjecting
his own personal opinions into
the news. It’s often a job easier
said than done. Time and again,
the press has been accused of
slanting the news. When that
happens, when news is slanted
the public is mislead. Further-
more, the press goes beyond its
role of informing the public and
takes on a role of telling its au-
dience what’s right and what’s
wrong.
Even a_ small-college
newspaper like the Ring-tum
Phi must realize the danger
when personal biases get in the
way of facts. But the Phi isn’t
alone in its obligation to watch

‘ out for this danger; a. small-

college student government
must recognize it too.

No one is accusing the mem-
bers of the Executive Commit-
tee of letting their personal opi-
nions interfere with their
judicial decisions, in this case,
their refusal to grant funds to
the Independent Union. But it is
something the EC should take
note of. Even subconscious
biases are apt to affect the out-
come of a decision or the repor-
ting of news, and the more an
EC member of Ring-tum Phi
reporter is aware of these
biases, the easier it will be to
take an objective point of view.

The Executive Committee
may have caused a ripple in the
calm waters of its so-far quiet
year. But whether the EC’s ac-
tions are ‘‘quiet” or capture
bold headlines doesn’t really
matter. It’s quiet consciences
that count.

Kissinger committee overlooked morality

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

When the Kissinger Commis-
sion on Central America releas-
ed its findings this past week,
Spanish Professors’ S.J.
Williams Jr. and Laurent
Boetsch were watching careful-
ly — watching to see whether
the report would be just another
stamp on Reagan’s policy in the
region or whether it might
signal a real change in policy.
What they saw neither surpris-
ed them nor pleased them.

Most upsetting to the two pro-
fessors was a glaring absence in
the report.

‘‘Lacking in the commission’s
report was morality. There was
a refusal to acknowledge the
morality involved. It just did
not incorporate the moral with
the political,’’ Boetsch said.

Williams concurred. “There
is no mention of morality in the
report, much less a mentioning
of humanitarianism. And
humanitarianism is just what is
in our national interests,” he

noted.

The commission report, re-
leased last Thursday in
Washington with great fanfare
proposed an increased aid
schedule to Latin American
countries. It urged that a

“In El Salvador, military aid
will kill people. Tying military
aid to human rights assumes
that some killing is okay, other
is not. Is that human rights? It
must be addressed,”’ Boetsch
pointed out. ‘The commission

 

‘We tread on thin ice when we

tell countries they must

improve their human rights.

’

 

greater emphasis be placed on
human rights when military aid
is given, and it. placed greater
emphasis on economic aid to
the region.

The whole question of aid to
the region irritated the pro-
fessors a great deal.

Boetsch was upset by the no-
tion of tying military aid to
human rights, for reasons not
commonly cited.

addressed the issue (of human
rights) but their conclusions are
really nothing new.”

On the question of economic
aid to the region, Boetsch is

equally adamant. “It’s hard to
oppose economic aid to a pover-
ty stricken region. But before
we give it, let’s find out where it
is going and what happens to it.
We may just be bolstering the
elite. We just have little idea of

where it goes,”’ he said.

The idea of sending aid to a
country in the midst of a civil
war is equally preposterous to
Boetsch.

“Send economic aid to a coun-
try in civil war? What sort of
economic infrastructure is pre-
sent?” he questioned.

Williams, while not as ada-
mant as Boetsch, agrees that
aid is a tricky question. He ap-
proaches the commission’s
recommendations on aid from a
different perspective.

“We tread on thin ice when
we tell countries they must im-
prove their human rights. What
is human rights? If the people
cannot address their grievances
to a responsible government,
then, you see, to what extent
can we tie aid to that region?”’
Williams asked.

“Aid is theoretically, I sup-
pose, humanitarian in purpose.
Don’t we act paternalistically in
giving this aid? ‘Won’t you be
good children?’ we seem to be
saying to the countries,”’
Williams said.

“Our capitalistic enterprises
have worked these countries
over,’’ he added.

While the report made no
mention of the contras receiv-
ing CIA backing in their at-
tempt to overthrow the San-
dinista government in
Nicaragua, both professors
pointed to the U.S. backing of
such subversive movements as
indicative of the short-
sightedness of U.S. policy in the
region.

“IT am absolutely opposed to
covert aid. I am opposed in the
strongest terms,’’ Boetsch
stated.

Boetsch continued to defend
his policy by noting that all the
contras seem to be doing is kill-
ing innocent civilians and
wreaking havoc on _ the
Nicaraguan economy, an
economy which until two years
ago the U.S. subsidized.
Boetsch is no strong supporter
of Nicaragua, either.

“The original intent of the
revolution was good,’’ Boetsch

IU seeks to ‘clear
the air’ with SAB

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Communication between the
Independent Union and the Stu-
dent Activities Board (SAB)
has begun as a result of a
meeting among Independent
Union Chairman Jim Sarle,
SAB Chairman Andy Cooney
and Assistant Dean of Students
Mike Cappeto.

The two chairmen said they
want to ‘‘clear the air’ between
the two organizations.

After being denied $623.40 in
funds by the Executive Com-
mittee last week, the Indepen-
dent Union is now seeking help
from the SAB in hope of expand-
ing on the number of social ac-
tivities offered to students.

Requests made by the In-
dependent Union include offer-
ing more social activities and
that these social activities not
always be “‘band parties.”’

SAB chairman Andy Cooney
said he is open for suggestions

- and added that he anticipated
no major problems in working
with the Independent Union.
“It’s no real problem unless
there is a conflict with bands at
the same time,”’ Cooney said.

Last weekend, the two
organizations had scheduled
bands in the Cockpit for both
Friday and Saturday night.

Sarle said that he did not wish
“to step on the toes’’ of the SAB
but wanted to enhance the
social life for the independents
at W&L.

As it stands, Cooney said
there is one problem, however,
in regard to competition be-
tween the SAB and the frater-
nities at W&L. Cooney said the
majority of the students in
fraternities, which compose ap-
proximately 60 percent of the
student body, would rather at-
tend their respective house par-
ties than an SAB party. Conse-

“THE

quently, Cooney said he
recognized that there is not an
adequate amount of social ac-
tivities for the independents. He
added, though, that it was not
financially feasible for the SAB
to have parties at the same
times fraternities did.

Dean Cappeto said he too
realizes the problem the in-
dependents face. “Weekends
can be pretty dull for in-
dependents,,’ he said.

Suggestions have been pro-
posed to force fraternities to
leave one weekend open for an
SAB party, yet both Sarle and
Cooney said they felt the idea
would not work.

SAB Treasurer John Hay-
wood said he thinks the building
of a new University pavilion
would help matters. He added
that the SAB is limited by its
current facilities and pointed
out that a new pavilion could
prompt a possible reorganiza-
tion of the SAB. With this possi-
ble reorganization, the desire
among the students for more
weekend parties would be
seriously taken into considera-
tion, Haywood said.

According to EC President
Bob Jenevein, the answer to the
independent students’ problems
is not the Independent Union.
Jenevein said that the feeling
among EC members is that the
Independent Union is like a
fraternity and should not be
eligible for money from the stu-
dent tax fund.

Jenevein said that although
he “perceived social problems
for the independent students, he
is far from convinced that the
Independent Union is capable of
solving these problems.

‘Maybe the SAB needs to do
more,” Jenevein said.

Sarle said he wanted the In-
dependent Union to help unify
the independents, promote in-
tramural participation, and act
as a meeting place for in-
dependents.

Sarle added that he also saw a
need for the Independent Union
to act as a lobbying group,
because, he said, ‘‘Decisions on
campus...overlook the in-
dependents.”’

Although the Independent
Union, which is financed from

bring probation
total up after Fall

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

An increased number of
freshmen and sophomores on
academic probation at Wash-
ington and Lee has led to a
higher-than-average _ total
number of W&L undergradu-
ates on probation this term.

is below 1.50 as freshmen, 1.6 as
sophomores, 1.8 as juniors or 1.9
as seniors. )

According to statistics releas-
ed by Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, a total of 77 students were
placed on academic probation
after Fall term.

That figure was coraposed of
48 freshmen (13 percent of the
class), 12 sophomores (3.6 per-
cent), seven juniors (2.3 per-
cent) and 10 seniors (3 percent).

The total number of students
on probation is up slightly from
the fall term total last year, 70,
and the fall term total of 1981,
72.

The number of freshmen on
academic probation rose sharp-
ly from last year’s 33, but Dean
John feels that last year may
have seen ‘“‘an unusually low
number.’’

This is supported by the fact
that there were 48 freshmen on
probation two years ago, and 47
in 1977, 1978, and 1979. The
freshman average for the past
seven years is 42.

Students on probation may
not participate in more than one
extra-curricular activity during
the tenure of their probation,
while students whose G.P.A.’s
are below the minimum at the
end of the shool year will fall
unter the Automatic Rule and
will not be asked back, unless
reinstated by the Automatic
Rule Committee.
SAC extends Pika penalty

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A recommendation from the
Interfraternity Council Judicial
Board to extend a social proba-
tion penalty for Pi Kappa Alpha
from two weeks to three weeks
was accepted Wednesday by the

Student Affairs Committee,

The original IFC ruling,
which was a penalty for a
pledge-fraternity activity which
resulted in medical attention
for two Pika pledges, was ex-
tended after new evidence was
discovered, according to Dean
of Students Lewis G. John.

In addition to the social pro-
bation period, Pika was penaliz-
ed $150 and was required to
begin an alcohol awareness pro-

gram, Dean John said,

The probation period began
after the first IFC ruling Jan. 5
and will end Jan. 26.

The pledge activity which
drew the penalty occured in
early December. One freshman
suffered a broken leg attemp-
ting to dodge a falling tree to be
used for a house Christmas
tree. A second freshman was
treated the same day by an
Emergency Medical Service
team for severe intoxication.

In addition, the IFC Judicial
Board placed Phi Kappa Sigma
on social probation following a
noise violation conviction in
Lexington District Court. The
noise violation is the first of the

1983-84 year.
The conditions of social pro-
bation are:

— No fraternity-sponsored
social functions are allowed by
a fraterntiy on social probation.

— No females are allowed in
the fraternity house of a frater-
nity on social probation.

— No more than five mem-
bers of a fraternity on social
probation can congregate at
any fraternity- or IFC-
sponsored social functions.

— A statement pledging that
all regulations have been
adhered to must be signed by
the house president.

14% of DUIs g0 to W&L

By BILL WOOLFOLK
Special to the Phi

Who remembers the party

Saturday, Feb. 20, 1982? Or the ©

one on Sunday, July 11, 1982?
How about the dance on Satur-
day, April 23, 1983?

There are three Washington &
Lee students who probably wish
they hadn’t been on the streets
of Lexington those days. Those
three dates were randomly
chosen from a two-year list of
arrests for driving under the in-
fluence of alcohol in the city of
Lexington, and one each of
those dates a W&L student was
charged with driving under the
influence.

Judicial records for the city
show that 121 persons were ar-
rested and charged with driving
under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) during 1982. That figure
for 1983 is 124.

Seventeen W&L students
were charged with DUI during
1982, 14 percent of the total DUI
arrests. In 1983 20 students were
arrested, 17.7 percent of the
total.

Can you recognize any of the
dates mentioned before? The
calendar shows no major

holidays, social functions or
university ceremonies on those
dates. However, in 1982, 29 (35)
of the DUI’s occurred the day of
a major holiday, social function
such as Fancy Dress and
Homecoming, or major univer-
sity function such as com-
mencement. Of those 35, seven
were W&L students. In 1983
those figures shifted upward,
with 45 DUI’s, nine of which
were W&L students.

You might expect more
students would be stopped for
DUI during major social func-
tions. Indeed, the records show
there were more DUI arrests at
those times in 1982 and 1983.
Take Fancy Dress weekend, for
example. In 1982 there were
eight DUI arrests, including
three W&L students, Fancy
Dress weekend. Four people
were arrested for DUI during
Fancy Dress 1983; none were
students. Someone could
possibly make a big deal out of
Friday March 5, 1982, the night
of the Fancy Dress Ball. The
greatest number of students ar-
rested on a single date occurred
that day: two.

What about fraternity rush?
September 1982 ranks tenth out

of the 24 months studied with
eight DUI’s, two of them
students. But September 1983
ranked first in the two years
with 29 DUI’s, seven of those 29
being students.

The percentage of W&L
students arrested during the
two rush periods actually drop-
ped between 1982 and 1983, fall-
ing almost nine-tenths of one
percent. :

Judge postpones battery trial

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Two men accused of assault-
ing a Washington and Lee stu-
dent following an altercation
outside the Cockpit last year
have had their court date
postponed to Feb. 21.

John A. Keeting and Louis
Carletto, both students at
Lebanon Valley College, were
granted the continuance Tues-
day by Lexington General
District Court Judge Joseph E.

charging Carletto with assault
and battery and Keeting with
assault and battery and
destruction of property.

The two were in town because
W&L, in its final football game
of the year, was playing
Lebanon Valley that afternoon.

According to Lexington
Police Chief Lawrence 0. Sut-
ton, the Parents’ Weekend inci-
dent began at about 1:30 a.m. as
Valder was leaving the Cockpit.

Carletto told officers he was
in the road when Valder began
to back up his car which almost
struck Carletto. A confrontation

resulted, according to the
report, and Carletto jumped up
on the hood of Valder’s car.

Valder then drove away,
throwing Carletto into the
street, the report says. Keeting,
a friend of Carletto’s, is said to
have pursued the vehicle, and

when it stopped at the stoplight
at Main and Nelson streets,
Keeting is said to have knocked
out Valder’s driver’s window
with his fists.

Keeting then held Valder, Sut-
ton said, until Carletto arrived.
A fight apparently ensued
among the three of them. Police
arrived shortly thereafter.

Carletto and Valder were
taken to the Stonewall Jackson
emergency room, where they
were both treated for facial
cuts, bruises and swelling.

Valder was released, and
Carletto was held for observa-
tion because of stitches he had
received.

Sutton said that Valder
originally requested charges of
malicious assault, a more
serious offense, but the
magistrate refused to issue a
warrant with that charge.

Nobel Laureate Cheslaw

Milosz will present a reading
from his works at Washington

day, Jan. 25.

Sponsored by the Glasgow
Endowment

Committee at

  
   

~ CHESLAW MILOSZ

W&L, the program will be at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. It is open to
the public at no charge.

The winner of the 1980 Nobel
Prize for Literature, Milosz is
an internationally honored poet,
essayist and novelist who has
been hailed as ‘‘one of the
greatest poets of our time,
possibly the greatest’ by
critics.

He is the author of two.

volumes of poetry, ‘‘Selected
Poems” and “Bells in Winter”’
and two novels, ‘‘The Issa
Valley” and “The Seizure of
Power’ as well as_ several
essays.

Since coming to the United

States in 1961, Milosz has
translated his early works from
Polish into English. His reading
will be given in English though
he will include some poems in
Polish.

Milosz was born in Lithuania
in 1911. A few years later his
engineer father moved the
family to Russia. But after
World War I, they returned to
his hometown, which had be-
come Polish territory known as
Wilno.

During World War II he work-
ed in Warsaw as a writer and
editor of Resistance publica-
tions. When the war ended, he
joined the Polish Diplomatic
Service, but broke with the
Regime in 1951, settling in Paris
to devote himself to writing and
translating.

He came to the United States
from France in 1961 at the in-
vitation of the University of
California, Berkeley, to teach
Slavic languages and literature.
Now an American citizen, he re-
mains at Berkeley as a tenured
professor on leave. He has also
served recently as a Dis-
tinguished Visiting Professor at
Harvard and at the University
of Michigan.

In 1981, after 30 years of en-
forced absence from Poland,
Milosz was invited to revisit his
homeland and was presented
with an honorary doctorate
from the Catholic Univesity in
Lublin. During his visit, he met
and talked with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.

Jenevein clarifies EC
view of drugs, honor

Executive Committee Presi-
dent Robert C. Jenevein
reacted this week to confusion
and controversy over whether
the EC has stated its view of
drugs in light of the Honor Code.

“There is a gross misunder-
standing among the student
body,”’ he said. “We are not
about to codify the system.

“Everything is treated case
by case. That is not to say that
any particular case of drug-
dealing will result in an honor
violation. Many cases may still
end up in Student Control.”

Last year’s EC had stated
that drugs would be the ex-
clusive province of the Student

Control Committee.

“Our statement was an effort
to free the system of codifica-
tion,’ Jenevein said. ‘‘We felt
we had to clarify our return to
policy.”

Jenevein expressed some
uncertainty as to how students
were reacting to knowledge
they might have of other
students’ activities involving
controlled substances.

“It’s a culture barrier with
this generation,” he said.
“Modern students are not likely
to turn in fellow students either
to the law or to the EC for use or
distribution of drugs. We can
only encourage them to do
that.’’

‘It’s a chance to do well while doing good. ’

Superdance provides WGL with a party and MDA funds for the handicapped

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s 1984
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance will give students a
chance to do something good
while having fun, Superdance
co-chairman Rick DeAlessan-
drini said.

Scheduled for Jan. 27-29 in
Evans Dining Hall, the Super-
dance will include four bands,
pie throws and a radiothon on
WLUR. The four bands will be
Brice Street, The Sparkplugs,
Caspar and Steps.

“It’s a chance to do well while
doing good. It’s a lot of fun,”’
said senior Mark Mitschow,
who will be dancing in the
Superdance for the second time.

The reason for the Super-
dance cannot be overshadowed
by the fun, however. Super-
dance co-chairman Markham
Pyle notes that many of the
poster children who attend the
dance cannot make it back the
next year because their condi-
tion has gotten worse.

‘That is not good. We have to
raise money to help solve the
problem. This is one of the
places where capitalism anc
charity intersect,”’ Pyle said.

DeAlessandrini also recalled
some of his experiences with
victims of muscular dystrophy.

“Some of the children who
are afflicted with MD come in
wheelchairs. They lose their
muscle control, but their minds
still work. They’re really not
handicapped when it comes to
the mind.” Dealessandrini said.

“They’re having to deal with
problems that are bigger than
life,’’ DeAlessandrini said.

DeAlessandrini said that
remembering what you’re dan-
cing for gives you the adrenalin
to keep going during the 30-hour
dance.

“Even though you're tired,
you realize what it’s for,’’ he
said.

DeAlessandrini has been

working on the Superdance for
three years. He previously had
served as entertainment chair-
man.

“At first, I just got into it
because it’s such a big
weekend. It’s a lot of fun. It’s
not anything that I consider a
burden,” DeAlessandrini said.

‘“‘Now, I sense that the at-
titude is that we can do
something good by having fun
ourselves. It’s probably the
most rewarding thing that I’ve
been involved with at W&L,”’
observed DeAlessandrini.

Mitschow said that he had
some reservations about the
Superdance at first because of
the 30-hour duration of the
dance.

“I didn’t think I could do it.
But I really enjoyed it,”
Mitschow said.

Mitschow said he was tired
after the two-hour break at 6
a.m. Saturday and near the end
of the dance.

“It’s not as bad as 30 hours
sounds. They keep you oc-
cupied. Anything to keep your
mind off the time,’’ Mitschow
explained.

However, Mitschow advises
anyone who is planning to dance
not to go to sleep during the two-
hour break because it is dif-
ficult to wake up after the short
nap.

DeAlessandrini said the pie

idea of W&L journalism pro-
fessor Robert de Maria.
DeMaria will again be one of

Although the dancing natural-

dance, the pie throws have
become popular in the last few
years.

  

We're refining the menu, too. So drop

DeAlessandrini said the
Superdance committee tries to
get professors who will attract
different groups of students who
are eager to toss a pie at a pro-
fessor in exchange for a con-
tribution to MDA. The commit-
tee usually tries to get someone
from the commerce school, the
military science department
and the physical education
department.

But the target who brought in
the most money last year was

tor, Pyle, said DeAlessandrini.
Several of the staffers who
worked for Pyle on the Super-
dance raised over $200 in order
to earn the right to smash a pie
into Pyle’s face.

“He was a pretty good sport
about it. He knows how he can
get people going,’’ DeAlessan-
drini said regarding Pyle’s
sacrifice. :

“He saw it as a chance to
benefit a good cause, or, as
Markham would say, a chance
to be cost effective,’ DeAles-
sandrini joked.

“The pie was a surprise. Ap-
parently, I’d been working my
staffers a little too hard,” Pyle
remarked.

“‘T was glad to do it, of course.

_ Anything for the kids,” he said.

DeAlessandrini said _ that
W&L President John D. Wilson
had said that he would be will-
ing to become a target of a pie,
but his schedule forced him to
be out of town this weekend.

‘‘President Wilson, as an out-
sider, came in and observed the
Superdance last year, and he
picked up the sense of it im-
mediately. If we can come off
that way, then I think we’re
headed in the right direction,”
DeAlessandrini said.

Superdance committee hopes to
raise $28,000 this year for the
Muscular Dystrophy Associa-
tion.

W&L’s 1983 Superdance rais-
ed more money per capita for
the Muscular Dystrophy
Association than any other col-
lege fundraiser. W&L was 12th
in total funds raised.

DeAlessandrini said that the
steering committee began work
on the Superdance almost im-
medrately after classes began
in September. The committee
started having meetings twice a
week in December.

In addition to the steering
committee, the dancers, spec-
tators and athletes who serve as
security guards all are vital to
the event’s success, DeAlessan-
drini said.

Jerry Darrell, who provided
Evans Dining hall for the Super-
dance, and the W&L frater-
nities, which contributed money
to pay for one of the bands, also
deserve credit, noted DeAles-
sandrini.

One addition to the Super-
dance this year will be the
WLUR radiothon. WLUR will
broadcast segments of the con-
certs, and disc jockeys Bob
Halloran and Taylor Hathaway
will broadcast live from Evans
Dining Hall form 2 p.m. to 5
p.m. Saturday. Halloran and
Hathaway will play three dance
sets Saturday afternoon.

“If you’re not dancing, come
out and have a beer and enjoy
the concert. Pledge money to
somebody to dance,’’ DeAles-
sandrini said.

Lee Chapel curator returned to W&L
on basis of his first visit

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Robert C. Peniston — known
as Capt. Peniston to those
around the university — seems
to epitomize the essence of the
mythic Washington and Lee
gentleman.

His blue blazer, gray vest and
tartan wool pants effervesce the
spirit of traditional Washington
and Lee dress.

But even more so, the spirit of
Peniston, who directs Lee
Chapel and the museum, seems
to come to life when the Captain
' speaks.

“The first time I stepped foot
on campus was in the summer
of 1971, when we brought our
son’s gear up from Florida. My
wife and I remarked then that
there was something different
about W&L,”’ said Peniston, sit-
ting in his “home” in Lee
Chapel.

“As I reflect back over the
years, the spirit of Robert E.

plain it. Somehow General
Lee’s spirit endures here. I’ve

historical atmosphere that
abounds at his alma mater, the
U.S. Naval Academy.

“The historical aura is strong
there, but I feel it just as strong-

 

ly here. The two institutions go
about it differently, but there is
not two cents worth of dif-
ference bewteen their objec-
tives — turning out men of
Honor.”’

Capt. Peniston arrived at the
Naval Academy by way of
Wichita, Kan., where he grew
up. He graduated in the Class of
’46 in an accelerated three-year
curriculum designed to turn out
officers for the war effort. His
first ship assignment was the
U.S.S. New Jersey.

After 23 years of various
assignments, Peniston ex-
perienced ‘‘the biggest thrill of
my life, really,’ when he was
assigned to return to that first
ship, the New Jersey, as com-
manding officer.

That assignment also proved
to be ‘‘one of his greatest heart-
aches’’ as the New Jersey was
inactivated during his com-
mand. Just last year, though,
Capt. Peniston took part in the
fanfare accompanying the
recommission of the ship.

After leaving the New Jersey,
he commanded one of the
“Goldplated cruisers,’ the
U.S.S. Albany. “I take great
pride,’’ he said, ‘‘in the fact that
I am one of the few officers of
the navy to command both a
battlehsip and a cruiser.”’

Peniston said his hardest job

was as assistant chief of staff —

One day in particular stands out
in Peniston’s mind as especially
frightening and trying.

“The day I remember most
vividly is 25 October 1973;’’ he
said, ‘‘when President Nixon
ordered all U.S. forces on alert

“I try to present the Chapel

to have it presented. Every-
thing here is to enhance the
reputation of General Lee, as if
it needs to be enhanced,” he
said with a chuckle.

endures here. I’ve always

been impressed with it.’

to possible Russian entry into
the Arab-Israeli War.”’

Peniston’s association with
Washington and Lee first began
in 1971 when he was command-
ing the Albany. His son, Robert,
wanted to go to the University.
As Peniston remembers, being
Florida residents and with 1971
being the first year Virginia ac-
cepted women, Robert didn’t
stand a “snowball in Hell’s
chance of getting in.” Peniston
then recommended to his son a
school in the Shenandoah Valley
that he had never visited, but
that was named after General
Robert E. Lee.

“If it has anything to do with
Robert E. Lee, you can’t go
wrong,”’ he said.

The family was ‘‘enamored”
with the place, but the son, who
was a Phi Kappa Sigma, died in
1975, just short of graduation.

“The four years he spent here
were the four happiest years of
his life,’’ reflected Capt.
Peniston, ‘‘and if he was so
pleased with it, the best thing
we could do was to become a
part of it, and be of assistance.”’

Peniston is now in charge of
all aspects of Lee Chapel, a job
he accepts with reverent
seriousness.

insurance coordinator, and in
1981 he coordinated the first
successful movable equipment
inventory ever taken at W&L.

“Anything I can do to
enhance the image or stature of
Washington and Lee, I’m glad
to do it. I’m willing to do
anything willing to be done.”’

Mrs. Peniston has also
become active in the W&L com-
munity, according to her hus-
band.

“She has taken many history
courses, and she loves them.

Peniston, paraphrasing Will
Rogers. ‘‘I find that they are a
pretty darn good cut of
America.”’

Because of the love he has
developed for the university,
Peniston opposes the lingering
question of coeducation, though
he admits he has ‘‘..no basis
other than a visceral feeling
that it is not necessary. It just
seems to me that W&L is unique
now, and if it changes I don’t
know if it would continue along
that line or not. I would hope
that Washington and Lee could
find a way to remain all-male
and still be the outstanding in-
stitution that it is.”

But, Capt. Peniston em-
phasized in conclusion, the
coeducation factor has not been
the significant tradition that
has set this school apart.

“The punchline with me is
that Washington and Lee has
endured over the years because
of the principle General Lee
laid down...that every man has
to be a gentleman.

“That is the most difficult
rule you can put down. Most

And she hasn’t met a troop up
there she didn’t like. Everyone
treats her with dignity and
respect, which one comes to ex-
pect at W&L.”’

Capt. Peniston even ‘‘saw to

tended Randolph-Macon

it is easier. It tests a man if he is
free to live, and yet expected to
live up to a standard.

“Much to the university’s
credit, that has endured. You
can count on one hand the in-
stitutions in the United States
that are ‘Strongholds of Honor.’
Washington and Lee is one of
those. I hope it never abandons

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton is urging Washington
and Lee students to report
break-ins and other crimes im-
mediately after they occur.

“They don’t report things
promptly,”” he said Monday.
‘They’ ll have to if they expect
any help from the police.

“We usually get the reports
second- or third-hand. We'd
prefer to get them from the in-
dividual.”

This includes matters which
involve W&L proctor Charles
Murray. ‘Instead of calling
Murph, call us,”’ Sutton said.

“If it is an offense and if it oc-
curs within the city limits of
Lexington, we’re responsible
for it we’ll come out,” he said.

“We'll assist even in very
minor instances. We need a
report, though, because what
we don’t know about, we can’t

Chief calls for student
support against crime

do anything about.”

Sutton said that often
students wait for periods rang-
ing from hours to days after a
crime has occurred before
reporting it.

“Sometimes they wait until
they find out that they need a
report for insurance purposes,”’
he said.

“The result is that frequently
the crime scene has _ been
destroyed or altered by the time
an investigating officer ar-
rives.”’

The police chief said that no
separate crime statistics are
available for Washington and
Lee or its students.

“They’re all citizens,” he
said. ‘I don’t see the University
as being separate or apart from
the community. They're all part
of the citizenry and that’s the
way the records are kept.

German professor to
lecture on Soviet law

Dietrich Andre Loeber, pro-
fessor of law at the University
of Kiel in West Germany, will
present a lecture entitled ‘‘On
the Importance of Understand-
ing Soviet Law’’ at the Washing-
ton and Lee University School
of Law on Monday, Jan. 23.

Sponsored by the Tucker Law
Forum and the International
Law Society at W&L, the lec-
ture will begin at 8 p.m. in
Classroom D of Lewis Hall. It is
open to the public at no charge.

Loeber is a visiting professor

at the Columbia University law
school.

A native of Riga, Latvia, he is
the author of four books and
about 70 articles and studies
written in English, German,
French, Italian, Spanish and
Latvian.

He has previously been a
visiting professor at the law
schools of UCLA and Stanford
University and was a research
associate in law at Harvard. He

spent a year of research at the »

Institute of International
Economic Relations in Moscow.

Grand jury ——

(continued from page 1)

Jenevein said that in order to
preserve the integrity of the
honor system’s principle of con-
fidentiality, he would refuse to
answer any such questions.

“If they were to ask me about
any personal information I have
gained outside my post as EC
President, I am bound by law
not to commit perjury but to
answer those questions.”’

He said questions regarding
the honor system were a dif-
ferent matter, however, “I was
prepared, if pressed, to tell
them that if they couldn’t
respect the confidentiality of
the honor system, they couldn’t
expect me to maintain the con-
fidentiality of the grand jury
proceeding,” he added.

“They have to do their job,
though,”’ he continued. ‘I can’t
blame them for that — I’d pro-
bably do the same thing.”

Before Jenevein testified, he
expressed concern that the
special grand jury might sub-
poena the Executive Commit-
tee’s honor records.

He indicated that his Thurs-
day appearance did not allay
those fears.

“I’m concerned that in the
desire to purge W&L of drug
users, they might subpoena
these files, and that would be a
monumental mistake,” he said.

“Those files are crucial to the
strength of the honor system.
Confidentiality is one of the ma-
jor tenets that’s allowed it to
survive all these years.

“Everybody’s good is at
stake. If they ask that the files
be opened, it will have long-
term ill effects on the honor
system as a whole.”

Jenevein said that ‘‘there are
several legally recognized
reasons for -maintaining con-
fidentiality, none of which cover
our honor system.”

On Friday he sent a letter to
Read which said in_ part:
‘While there is perhaps no legal
ground for the Honor System
secrets to be kept that way,
morality and the law do not
always go hand-in-hand.

“And we all know that the
school’s Honor System and the
law are on the same side of
right and wrong.”

When asked about Jenevein’s
concern, Read said, ‘I don’t
have any comment to make
about him or the records or
anything else.

“I’m not talking to anybody
about the special grand jury.
Now is not an appropriate time
to make any comment.”

Read would say only that the
jury is “going to be a while
longer.” By law, the panel can
function in its present form for
a maximum of six months.

Before Jenevein testified, one
of the grand jurors told him that

they expected to be in business
for about two more months.

President Wilson said that he
expects that the jurors ‘‘want
my sense of the overall problem
in Lexington and the University
and they want to become more
acquainted with University
policy for student drug of-
fenses.”’

The W&L policy statement on
drugs says that the University
“shall act as neither a sword
nor a shield’? when the state
acts on an individual’s use of
controlled substances.

Wilson said that ‘‘after the
shock of last spring’ and “the
major arrests,”’ people became
“aware of the grievous conse-
quences to the career and well-
being that occur with this sort of

 

To the Editors:

The subject of my argument
is Mr. Stachura’s section in the
‘“‘Phi’’ where he shows his bias-
ed views and his stupidity. Per-
sonally, I can’t believe the Phi
promoted Mr. Stachura to
Sports Editor this year. All of
last year we heard his verbal
assaults on last year’s Heisman
Trophy winner, Hershel

Walker. Tell me something Mr.
Stachura, if someone offered
you a multi-million dollar con-
tract to be an editor for a well-
circulated paper, now, wouldn’t
you take it? I thought so.

I thought to myself, if I don’t
read his column, maybe others
are thinking on the same lines
and he won’t get to waste the
page of the ‘‘Phi’’ on his idiotic

their own union. While we are
not against charging each
member $4 or $5, this alone will
not cover our costs. As to the
contention that the _ in-
dependents don’t support their
own cause, we point to the
Automatix, the band in the
Cockpit last Saturday. The in-
dependents came out in
numbers and even enabled the
IU to net a marginal profit.

Contrary to the EC belief, we
are trying to become neither a
second SAB nor an 18th frater-
nity, claims the EC made.

Rather our purpose is to get the

W&L community to recognize
and deal with the problems we
as independents face here at
fraternity-oriented W&L. In-
dependents are an integral part
of W&L and we deserve to be
treated as such. If Deans Cap-
peto and John, as well as Presi-
dent Wilson, are able to

recognize the importance of and
need for the Independent Union,
why then cannot the EC

reflections. Then, maybe the
editors will use the space to
report more of the less popular
sports that many of our fellow
students participate or perhaps
something on the IM sports. It
hasn’t happened at least not
yet. I broke down and read Mr.
Stachura’s column this week
only to see he was still writing
his absurd column. (See Out,
Time) In this (Jan. 12) issue of
the “Phi” he refers to the swim
team as “The boys over at
Twombly Pool.”” How gay can
you sound? This is sports, there
is no need to exercise poetic
license.

The paragraph that disturbed
me enough to write this letter
was his “putting things into
perspective” about Georgia’s
upset victory over Texas in the
Cotton Bowl. I think it is impor-
tant to point out that both UGA
and UT have very similar game
plans — a strong defensive that
causes their opponents to make
mistakes and an offensive to
capitalize on these mistakes. In
his article Mr. Stachura says
that game films show a Georgia
lineman guilty of “flagrant”
holding penalty on the play that

Reader attacks Sports Editor’s Time Out

the winning touchdown was
scored. It’s ironic that the
referees did not make the call,
considering the Univ. of Texas
is so close to where the game
was played.

Second Mr. Stachura says
that the UGA player who re-
covered the fumbled punt that
set up the final score has failed
out of school. What does that
have to do with the price of tea

in China? Are you saying that

Gary Moss, who has now failed
out, was destined to recover the
fumble and if he wasn’t playing
that Texas would have gotten
it? Mr. Stachura fails to men-
tion anything about the Texas
player who fumbled the ball in
the first place. As I mentioned
earlier, Georgia and Texas both
prey on their opponent’s
mistakes. It was the Texas
player that made the mistake
and that’s the reason Texas lost
the game.

In closing, there are more in-
triguing sports stories that I’m
sure the students would be more
interested in reading than Mr.
Stachura’s respections.

experimentation.

“I would think that use had
fallen off after that. I get the im-
pression from conversations
with students I trust that the use
is lower. I’m leaving alcohol out
of that.”

“These felony convictions
will reverberate through the
lives of our former students in
debilitating ways,’’ Wilson con-
tinued. ‘‘I hope that some good
can come of that — that others
will realize that this is a very
serious business.”’

‘“‘We have a responsibility,”’
he said, ‘‘for creating an en-
vironment where people have
the opportunity to learn and
grow into responsible social be-
ings.

“If a student finds himself in
trouble, he should be able to ap-
proach a University official
without the fear that if he did he
would necessarily face discipli-
nary action.

“‘We would fail in our role as
mentors and ‘counselors if
Students . hesitated to seek
help.”’

“I have one further concern,”
Wilson said. ‘‘That is that our
disciplinary system is student
run and depends to a high
degree on confidentiality. I
hope that confidentiality can be
maintained.”

Lexington Police Chief Sutton
said that ‘even though the
grand jury is_ investigating,
we're still doing investigations
and making arrests.

‘“‘We’re not concentrating on
the users: we’re concentrating
on the dealers.”

Two people were recently ar-
rested in Lexington and charg-
ed with possession of narcotics
with intent to distribute.

Clinton O’Neill Turner was
located while in town with his
car with Washington, D.C.,
tags.

His preliminary hearing in
General District Court was
scheduled for Tuesday, but
Judge Joseph E. Hess granted a
continuance to Feb. 21 because
the tests on the substances con-
fiscated from his car had not
come back from the laboratory.

David Jeffrey Latrud was ar-
rested in conjunction with coun-
ty law enforcement officials.
They were able to establish
enough probable cause to
secure search warrants, raid
the house where he was staying,
and make the arrest.

Latrud’s preliminary hearing
is scheduled for Jan. 25. Both
men are free on bond.

Judge Honts, who signed the
order setting up the special
grand jury, said that the report
will come to him sealed, and
that it will be his decision
whether or not to make the
panel’s findings public.

“T haven’t made up my mind
on that, and I won’t until the
report comes in,’’ he said.

Factors he said he might take
into account include: ‘‘public
interest,” ‘‘the protection of in-
nocent people’ and ‘‘the sancti-
ty of the procedure itself.”

“The report will remain seal-
ed unless someone requests that
it be opened, and then J’ll rule
on it,” he said. “I fully expect
someone to make that request.”

because the moderate left
organizations have _ been
eliminated from the political
process by physical measures.
If we want pluralism, we need
to encourage and permit
them.”’

Boetsch noted that in Spain,
Italy and France, once the Com-
munist Party was allowed to
participate in elections and
field their own candidates, the
popularity of the party decreas-
ed. He sees the same carry-over
occurring in Latin America

noted, referring to the revolt
against the Somoza regime,
‘“‘but it has strayed from its
original intent.”

By continually attacking
Nicaragua in the press and on
land through the contras, a
polarization of political thought
and philosophy is occurring in
the region.

“The situation in Latin
America is not an East-West
conflict,” he said. “The situa-

tion results from hunger —
physical hunger and poverty.
The region has more than its
share of military rulers who
disregard human rights.”’

“The tragedy of our policy
has been that every time an op-
portunity for reform and in-
digenous revolution has raised
its head, we have been there
stomping it in the bud. We need
to back pluralism in the region.
All we now see is a radical left

were the left allowed to partake
fully in national elections. As
long as such groups do not ad-
vocate the overthrow of the
democratic process, Boetsch
believes they should be allowed
to participate.

While both professors have
problems with parts of the
report, both find hope in it also.

“The findings are positive,
though the recommendations
are not,” Boetsch said. “It is a

positive move. We now realize
that we cannot consider the
region in one-dimensional
terms. It is complex, and the
problems are different for each
of the nations.”’

Williams agrees. “If the
report shows anything, it points
to the fact that we need to
reconsider establishing rela-
tions with Cuba.”’

One glaring absence from
both the report and the recom-
mendations is the mention of
the church in Central America.

“It’s remarkable! Not one
mention of the church. It would
behoove us to listen to what the
church has to say, especially of
social injustice, of reform, and
all from a non-Marxist, non-
Leninist point of view,’’ Boetsch
said.

Both professors noted the role
of the church in Latin America
has figured prominently in the
past. Military leaders once

sought the consent of the church
in establishing any new govern-
ment. Recently, especially
after Vatican II, the church has
taken a more independent role.
Liberation theology and calls
for the righting of social in-
justices have been the new
gospels of the church, gospels
many military leaders do not
want to hear.

Criticism and praise aside, by
what authority can a professor
of modern languages comment
on a political statement?

‘*My approach does not come
from political science or
economics. My knowledge
comes from literature and
culture, and they are no less
valid. There is a great deal to be
learned in how these people ex-
press themselves. After all,
isn’t literature just another
form of revolution?’ Boetsch
asked.

tion,’’ EC President Bob Jene-
vein said.

Jenevein added that the
authority to determine whether
a student is in good standing has
been granted the EC by the
Board of Trustees.

The EC also castigated two
committees for their lack of a
proper budget report.

David Thompson of the
Frisbee Club had not prepared
a printed, duplicated budget
report for the EC. He said he
had not been informed that he
was to present a report until
Monday afternoon. Jenevein,
though, mentioned that the
schedule for budget hearings
had been in the EC minutes in
November and December.

Three members of the
Frisbee Club have paid dues for
both the fall and spring seasons
and three more paid for the fall
season, Thompson said. Dues
are $10 per season. Thompson
added that the club might have

 

Sunfire

a budget surplus at the end of
the year.

The Student Association for
Black Unity, meanwhile, had a
written budget report but no one
present to answer questions.
And there were questions.

SABU’s initial budget request
in September had been $5,100;
$3,000 for two speakers and
$2,100 for the SABU ball. The
EC cut that to $1,500, all intend-
ed for the ball.

The budget report Monday
night showed projected expen-
ditures of $750 for the ball,
which touched off debate
among the EC members as to
whether SABU was spending its
funds correctly.

“I’m not too concerned that
they’ve deviated from their
original plans.” vice president
Dave Judge said.

Dawson said, ‘‘If they’re go-
ing to substantially change
(their projected expenditures),
they should come back to us.”’

Green, agreed.

“If it had gone the other way
around (used speaker money to
pay for the ball), perhaps we
wouldn’t agree,’’ Green said.

Senior representative George
Youmans and freshman
representative Andrew
Caruthers said it was SABU’s
prerogative to do whatever it
liked with its money.

Action Monday night, the EC
heard an initial report from a
subcommittee, chaired by
secretary Len Howard, _in-
vestigating the possibility of
hiring a secretary for the stu-
dent organizations. Howard
said a 10-month contract for an
$8,500 salary was being con-
sidered. The secretary’s salary
would be paid from university
funds.

The EC decided also to limit
voting in tomorrow’s coeduca-
tion poll to undergraduates and
to allow the Student Bar
Association to conduct a similar
poll among law students.

Injury-ridden

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Second-leading scorer Lex
Fitzenhagen is out of the W&L
basketball lineup for at least
two weeks with a hyperextend-
ed knee joint.

Second-leading rebounder
Scott Shannon is taking anti-
inflammatory pills to combat a
nagging knee injury.

Freshmen forwards Rob
Spencer and Jeff Harralson are
recovering from a broken bone
in the ankle and a broken
finger, respectively.

And head coach Verne Can-
field has a very big headache,
as his 8-5, injury-plagued
Generals host fourth-ranked,
undefeated Roanoke College
tonight at 7:30 in Warner
Center.

With a three-game winning
streak and a 3-0 ODAC record
after a Thursday night

thrashing of Emory & Henry,
91-49, the Generals traveled on
Saturday night to Bridgewater

College, where a_ promising
season suffered a setback.

Two minutes into the game
Fitzenhagen, who had a game-
high 21 points against Emory &
Henry, went down with the in-
jury to his knee. The Generals
went on to a 64-53 defeat at the
hands of the Eagles.

“With Bridgewater we just
got outplayed,”’ explained Can-
field. “They were very ag-
gressive, we lost our concentra-
tion and we deserved to be beat.

‘Losing Lex would certainly
be a factor,’’ added Canfield,
‘not only in the number of
points he scores, but in the
things he creates with his speed
and quickness.”’

In addition to the hyperex-
tended knee, Fitzenhagen has
possible rotary instability and
cartilage damage, according to
trainer Jim Murdock, who
estimates a two-week absence
for Fitzenhagen.

With Fitzenhagen out, leading
scorer and rebounder John Lee

Sports

Graves had to carry the scoring
load against Bridgewater. The
senior forward was nine of 15
from the floor and had a game-
high 20 points.

Junior guard Kevin McClat-
chey followed Graves with 10
points. No other General had
more than five.

W&L was outshot 59 percent
to 45 percent from the field, but
the team showed typical con-
sistency from the free-throw
line with 87.5 percent shooting.
This percentage had little effect
on the outcome, though, since
the Generals only had eight at-
tempts, compared _ to
Bridgewater’s 25, of which it
made 18.

Despite being slowed by in-
jury, junior forward Shannon
had a game-high seven re-
bounds. He was less effective in
the scoring department,
however, going one for seven
from the field, for two points.

According to Canfield, Shan-
non’s injury is less understood
than Fitzenhagen’s. ‘‘Scott has
got something wrong with his
knee, and we don’t quite know
what yet,” said the 20th-year
coach. ‘‘I think he should be
able to play (against Roanoke)
but he may not be up to full
speed.”

In the demolition of Emory &
Henry in Warner Center a week
ago, the Generals held a 52-23
halftime lead and cruised to the
easy victory.

Emory & Henry shot a miser-
able 39 percent from the floor in
earning the loss.

In addition to Fitzenhagen’s
21 points, Graves had 17 and
junior guard David Wilkinson
added 10.

In preparation for the
Roanoke game, Canfield is try-
ing to come up with a strategy

to offset the injuries. ‘‘Obvious-

ly we’ve got to make some other
plans,” said the coach.

For example, said Canfield,
“‘We’ve got to take better care
of the ball, which we didn’t do
against Bridgewater.

“I’m sure some time or
another with Roanoke we’ve got
to spread the ball out,’’ he add-
ed. ‘‘We sure as heck can’t run
with them.”

Whatever strategies Canfield
comes up with, he has full con-
fidence in his players. ‘‘I think
it should be noted that they’re

not quitters; they have never
quit,” said the coach. “It just
doesn’t enter my thoughts that
they’d ever quit, no matter
what the odds. And I’d say for
the Roanoke game the odds will
be very much against us.”’
Roanoke is led by senior for-
ward Tim Woodson (22 points
per game), one of three players
who averages in double figures.
Following the Roanoke game,
the Generals travel to Lynch-
eg College on Saturday, Jan.

Warner Center was the scene
last Saturday of the Washingotn
and Lee fencing team’s first
regular season meet. The
Generals triumphed over the
University of Virginia for the
second straight year by a score
of 14-13, but fell to Virginia
Tech, 11-16.

Senior Pat Berg and junior
Chuck DePoy led the team
against U.Va, each going 3-0 in
sabre. Sophomore Mike Berg
was 1-2, bringing the sabre
squad score to 7-2.

A strong 2-1 performance
from freshman Steve Holmes
paced the foil squad, while
sophomores Mike Grow and
Lou Mondello finished 1-2 and
1-1, respectively. Freshman
Jeff Blomster was 0-1, giving
the foil squad a 4-5 mark.

The epee squad finished 3-4
with senior Rick Swagler,
sophomore Cotton Puryear and
freshman Charles Grandpierre
all finishing 1-2.

The Generals finished off the
Hoos last year when U.Va was
the Virginia Cup Champion. It
was the first victory over U.Va
since 1941.

The Generals had more trou-
ble with the Hokies of Virginia
Tech. Holmes led the team with
a 3-0 performance, with Grow

A sate bet?

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...AS you head over to the
Warner Center tonight to watch
The Game (W&L vs. Roanoke
Who?), here are some thoughts
on what the evening’s festivities
might bring. Frankly, the
Generals may be the only
ODAC squad able to unseat the
Maroons. But with the injury to
junior intensity man Lex
Fitzenhagen and assorted other
Generals looking like extras
from an outtake of ‘“‘The Day
After,” the game has a changed
outlook. But there’s no sense
crying over spilled milk. in
Roanoke, W&L will be facing
the No. 4-ranked team in Divi-
sion III, and one that, for the
most part, outmans the
Generals. It would be undeni-
ably a safe bet to go with the
Maroons tonight. To win, W&L,
as it has in all previous vic-
tories, has to be able to
establish its game first, and
then make sure Roanoke does
not settle into its game. A tall
order for even a_ healthy
Generals’ squad. There are,
however, these things to con-
sider. At 10-0 the Maroons have
yet to be tested. As No. 4 in the
country, they, like last year,
have everything to lose. What’s
more, they undoubtedly can’t

help from considering these
facts, either, a sort of self-
inflicted pressure that Coach
Verne Canfield certainly won’t
mind. One final relevant state-
ment: W&L 91, Emory & Henry
49; Roanoke 82, Emory & Henry
68. I’ve never been one much for
safe bets, and I’m sure the good

guys in white aren’t, either....

Time Out...

....Checking other campus ac-
tivity, kudos are extended to the
W&L fencing-club on its im-
pressive weekend performance.
The query from this corner is
how much longer until this
group is justly elevated to varsi-
ty status...

....Tennis is in the sportlight,
once again, as John McEnroe
reaffirmed his claim to the
world No. 1 ranking with his
weekend thrashing of the dour
Czech’ Ivan Lendl. With four
different gentleman taking
each of the four majors, this
year’s Volvo Grand Priz
Masters — a heretofore ex-
traneous post-year playoff
money binge — actually meant
something. All this aside, the
man to watch is the 19-year-old
Swede Mats Wilander, who will

The Washington and Lee
swim team lost a close meet to
Virginia State champion James
Madison University but
defeated Towson State and
Loyola last weekend to even
their dual meet record at 3-3.

The Generals lost at Division
I Madison by a score of 61-52
last Friday night. W&L bounced
back to claim victories against
Towson St. (64-47) and Loyola
(91-20) in a double dual meet
last Saturday at Towson.

Against Madison, W&L divers
Joe Donovan and Matt Devito
placed ist and 2nd on both the
one- and three-meter boards.

Junior Bobby Pearson and
freshman Dan Trice also led the
Generals with outstanding in-
dividual performances last

weekend.

The Generals have lost two
dual meets to Division I and II
teams. Both meets were decid-
ed on the final event. Head
swimming coach Page Remil-
lard noted, though, ‘‘We don’t
get frustrated by being touched
out on the final relay by a Divi-
sion I or II team who is not in
our league.”’

Though the Generals want to ~

do well against Division I and II
teams, their primary concern is
performing well against Divi-
sion III teams.

“This year we want to get
back into the top 20 (Division
III),” said Remillard. ‘Right
now we are in the midst of a suc-
cessful season,’’ he added.

This weekend the Generals
travel to Washington, D.C., to
face Georgetown and Frostburg
State in a double dual meet.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team returned to its
pre-Christmas form by regis-
tering four victories at two
triangular meets. Last night at
the Davidson College Triangu-
lar, the Generals defeated
Davidson, 34-17, and Pfeiffer
College, 47-12. On Saturday they

swept two at the Loyola College
Triangular, thrashing the hosts,
44-9, and slipping past Johns
Hopkins, 26-20.

Last ‘night’s road victories,
which upped the W&L season
mark to 6-1, were paced by
strong efforts from tri-captains
Tim Valliere, who saw duty at
167 lbs. and 177 lbs., and Jeff

be the next to win the Grand
Slam, maybe this year, certain-
ly next....And miracle of
miracles, Martina Navratilova
did not win a tournament that
she entered. Czech-mate Hana
Mandlikova ended Martina’s
streak at 54 match victories.
Her last loss was in the French
Open last May. Tennis writers
say it’s the best thing that could
have happened to women’s ten-
nis, that a new rivalry is
developing. Martina is relieved.
Now, she can return to playing
left-handed again....

....More news in the continu-
ing saga of Mike ‘‘Sign the Dot-
ted Line’ Rozier. The Boy
wonder from Husker land has
fired his agent, Mike Trope,
who brought him the Pittsburgh
Maulers on a silver platter.
What Mr. Trope forgot to tell
Rozier is that he will get 13 per-
cent of the running back’s
salary over the next six years.

Gee, maybe if Rozier had turn-
ed the contract over to the front
side and read it before signing
the back there would be no
cause for concern. But then, he
didn’t. Gee, I remember when
football used to be a game...It
was much more enjoyable
then....

....The Prince of Prophetdom
has come forth to proclaim
these words on America’s
favorite football feast: ‘The
team that ‘wants it the most’
usually wins the Super Bowl. It
is impossible to determine
which team that is, however,
before the game begins. So that
leaves us prophets to play the
percentages, and as much as I
hate to admit it, the Redskins
look unbeatable. The Redskins
have more weapons than the
Raiders do (watch out — Mark
Moseley had his bad game two
weeks ago), and if Theismann
can steer clear of Lester Hayes,
the Redskins will win.” The
Prince picks it like this: 34-31,
Redskins...

....Finally, this word from the
NCAA: The tournament com-
mittee has agreed to up the
basketball championship to a
64-team event, the fourth in-
crease in as many years. Says
Dave Gavitt, head of the tourna-
ment committee, ‘I think we
have the right number, now.”
That sounds good, Dave, until
next year when teams 65-68
petition for another increase....
