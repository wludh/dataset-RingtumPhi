Drop in student
market projected

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

The Washington and Lee
Class of 1996 will only number
265, a drop of 104 students as
compared with the class of 1986,
according to the Admissions Of-
fice Demographics report for
the faculty. The prediction is
based on the assumption that
the economy and federal finan-
cial aid situations remain stable
and that the two classes are
academically comparable.

These figures — from the Na-
tional Center for Education
Statistics — are based on the
study’s prediction that the 18-
year-old population will dwindle
making admissions more com-
petitive among colleges.

Associate Director of Admis-
sions, Van H. Pate pointed out
that beyond 1992 “there is
another bubble.” Pate said that
the children of ‘‘baby-boom”
babies will be entering college.

Pate discounted this increase,
though, saying it was ‘‘flatter
and not as “‘wide.”’

Adults from the baby-boom
era, Pate said, are having fewer
children and are having them
later in life.

According to the study,
W&L’s 15-state market which
has accounted for over 84 per-
cent of the student enrollment

in the past five years, is ex-
pected to suffer a 22 percent
decline in 18-year-olds between
1982 and 1992. (See accompany-
ing graph.)

W&L’s five-state market (ex-
cluding Texas), which has ac-
counted for nearly half the
enrollment over the past five
years, is expected to drop by 33
percent. Only Texas is pre-
dicted to post a gain, .02 per-
cent,

The 15-state market is of key
importance to W&L, according
to the report, because it ac-
counts for 84 percent of both the
accepted pool and the enrolling
class.

According to Pate, the bulk of
the statistics, particularly the
15-state market projections are
from the national report but,
“the Center also ran some
special searches for us.’’

The Admissions Office has
also prepared a breakdown on
the number of students who
possess characteristics typical-
ly found in W&L students.

eMales who score 500 or more
on the verbal section of the SAT

eMales who also score 550 or
better on the Math section of the
SAT, and

top 2/5ths of their class and

Coed issue

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

This generation of
Washington and Lee gentlemen
is not the first to confront the

issue of coeducation. As early .

as 1896, the faculty considered
the possibility of coeducation,
voting the idea down. In 1902, it
was again br t up, and
again it was defeated in a vote
of the faculty.

In recent years, most of the
remaining all-male schools, in-
cluding Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, and Virginia, have decided
to go coed. Their decisions led
W&L twice to consider the ques-
tion of coeducation — in 1969
and 1975.

  

addressed before

‘Many of those schools were
making changes for pedagogi-
cal reasons, to enrich their
overall educational experi-
ences,” said Frank Parsons,
the executive assistant to the
president and a 1965 graduate of
W&L, from his office in Wash-
ington Hall.

‘Many others, though, looked
ahead and saw difficulties for
themselves. Student recruit-
ment possibilities were enhanc-
ed by the admissions of women.

“In that climate, in 1969, the
question was addressed here by
a faculty student committee,”’
said Parsons.

That committee, he explain-
ed, was deliberately ‘‘loaded’’
with proponents of coeducation
by then-President Robert E.R.

Huntley. They were charged
with looking at the issue and
determining the consequences
of going coed, ‘‘not necessarily
whether to go coed.”

The faculty committee
studied coeducation’s conse-
quences from two angles: from
that of simply adding women,
thereby increasing the student
body size, or from that of
substituting women, thereby
maintaining the same student
population.

The conclusions of the com-
mittee, explained Parsons,
were never made public or
acted upon. The Board of
Trustees, in response, simply
thanked the committee and ask-
ed Huntley to keep them
abreast of the situation.

The 1975 study was requested
by the Board of Trustees pro-

‘bably at the request one year

earlier of the student body
president, remembered Par-
sons. He was a law student who
had not attended W&L as an
undergraduate and who had run
emphasizing his pro-coeduca-
tion stance.

Dean Lewis John’s office pro-
vided the staff support for that
study, which Parson’s describ-
ed as “substantial.’’ John’s of-
fice consulted several schools
that had recently gone coed,
asking them to assess their
gains and losses, and asking for
faculty comment.

W&L Siadents
Board to examine issue with
great care, Ballengee says

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Since formally making the
announcement that they will
reexamine the issue of coeduca-
tion at Washington and Lee, the
members of the W&L Board of
Trustees have adjourned until
their February meeting to
study the question and probe
the options, according to Board
Rector James M. Ballengee.

Ballengee said that the Board
plans to make a preliminary
study of the issue in February in
an effort to be ready to make a
final judgment at its May
meeting.

“‘We have been looking at pro-
jections that Bill Hartog and his
people have brought to us,”’ Bal-
lengee said. ‘‘and that, coin-
ciding with the arrival of the
new president of Washington
and Lee, has raised this issue
again.”

- Ballengee said that the Board
was given no particular direc-
tion on how to study the issue in
preparing for the vote.

‘‘We’re taking our lead from
President Wilson,” he said.

“I have not appointed any
committee or committees,’’ he
continued, ‘“‘my current think-
ing is that we would do this a
committee as a whole.”

“We will examine it in a very
careful and deliberate way.”’

Ballengee said that it would
be difficult to predict the pre-
sent opinion of the current
Board on the question and that
he thought the board would vote
as individuals.

“T don’t think there are any
factions on the Board,’’ he said.

The announcemcnt of four
new Board members to replace
retiring members is expected in
the next week. Although the
names of the new members
have not been announced yet,
Ballengee said he is in the pro-
cess of speaking to the can-
didates and that he foresees no
dramatic change in the senti-
ment of the Board because of
the transition.

“T don’t think the change will
affect the decision in any way,”’
he said.

In the press announcement
released arter the Board’s

meeting two weeks ago, Ballen-
gee wrote that the reexamina-
tion of the question stemmed
from the board’s ‘desire to
understand all of the options
before (it).’’ Ballengee men-
tioned alternatives of lowering
enrollment or lowering stan-
dards as the other viable ‘‘op-
tions.”

Ballengee agreed with Presi-
dent Wilson that the major con-
stituents in the decision are the
faculty, the alumni and the
students. He also said that pro-
spective students, college
counselors and citizens of Lex-
ington would be considered in

the decision.

He added that all of these con-
stituents would be informed of
any major actions by the Board
before its May decision.

“We're not going to handle
this like Grenada,” he said.
‘“‘We are going to keep people in-
formed.”

In a statement released after

the Board’s October meeting,
Ballengee wrote, ‘‘...American
colleges and universities are
now facing an unprecendented
fall-off in the number of high
school graduates who will enter
upon collegiate study.”’

Coeducation would be tough on fraternities

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

The question of coeducation
and its possible effect on the
fraternity system at Washing-
ton and Lee is still lingering
around the campus, but accor-
ding to officials at the Universi-
ty of the South (Sewanee) and
Randolph-Macon College, two

In 1968 Seiter said Sewanee
had 800 males enrolled, while
only 380 were enrolled last year.

According to Seiter, the abili-
ty of the fraternities at Sewanee
to pay their bills has been ham-
pered by the decline of the num-
bers in the respective houses,
yet he added, “I think the
change in the social life has
been extremely positive.”’

 

“we do have a significant decline in

the number of males in fraternities.”

 

schools that changed their all-
male status and admitted
women over a decade ago,
coeducation has only had a
minimal effect on the survival
of the fraternities.

At the University of the South,
the arrival of women did not
pose any serious problem to the
fraternity system said the uni-
versity’s dean of men, Doug
Seiter. Seiter said that since the
decision to go coed in 1969, the
number of fraternities on the
university’s campus has re-
mained the same.

“Presently, we have the same
number of fraternities,’’ Seiter

said, but he added, ‘“‘we do have ©

a significant decline in the
number of males in frater-
nities.”

 

Seiter explained that the cam-
pus of the University of the
South is somewhat isolated with
no other colleges nearby, which
is not the case at W&L. As a re-
sult of the school’s accepting
coeducation, the students now
have many social outlets and
have parties every weekend,
Seiter said. Having graduated
from Sewanee in 1965, Seiter
said the school “has gained so
much more” by admitting
women.

Although many people at
Sewanee were afraid the
change would wipe out much of
the tradition of the school,
Seiter said, “‘we were able to
preserve what was of value of
the all-boys’ school.”’

Andrews agreed with Seiter
that the change to coeducation
has been for the better.

There have been no momen-
tous changes in the structure of
the fraternities, Andrews said.
Identical to Sewanee, the num-
ber of fraternities has remained
the same since the decision of
the school to go coed in 1972, An-
drews said.

Of course there are now fewer
males at the college, but An-
drews said, ‘‘there is simply no
problem at Randolph-Macon
with the student population.”

Andrews pointed out that the
relationships between the
males and females were not
healthy before women were ad-
mitted to the school.

“TI think Randolph-Macon was
not normal because women
came to campus for only social
purposes,”’ he said.

According to Andrews, wom-

said.

Meanwhile, here at W&L,
Dean of Students Lewis John
anticipates that if the school
does go coed, some fraternities
could run into trouble.

“Obviously, it’s going . to
make it tougher to keep all 17
fraternities on campus with
fewer males,” John said. He ad-
ded that he felt the social life

would still revolve around the
fraternities at W&L, but an-
ticipated that there would be
less ‘frenzy activity’? on
weekends and on Wednesday
nights.

John did point out that
previously at W&L over 80 per-

cent of the student body was af-
filiated with fraternities and if
the interest increased to that
point again, there would be less
of a problem with the stability
of the fraternities.

en have since been fully in-
tegrated into both the social en-
vironment and the student af-
fairs of the school.

“It’s all gone very well so far,
and it’s as if women have been
here the whole time,’’ Andrews

President of the the Inter-
fraternity Council Emery Ell-
inger said he does not foresee
the interest in fraternities in-
creasing with the advent of
coeducation.

“It is absurd to think W&L
fraternities will increase from
60 to 80 percent.”’ he said.

Ellinger explained that fra-
ternities will not have as many
members if women enter the
school and said that many of the

fraternities would fold because
of their inability to fulfil] their
financial responsibilities.

Ellinger also said, ‘...the
W&L fraternity system has
been so strong because of its be-
ing an all-male school surround-
ed by five girls’ schools.”’

Surrounding
women’s colleges

fear coed W&L

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

If W&L were to go coed,
neighboring women’s colleges
say they fear the ‘‘new W&L”’
might, in the long run, irrevers-
ibly harm the social life and
academic life of their schools.
While none of the schools
believe such a move would
force them to go coed also, they
acknowledge that there will be
immediate effects.

One of these effects will be on
the social life W&L shares with
neighboring schools. All of the
area women’s colleges feel the
close social network developed
over the years would be broken
by coeducation.

“Mary Baldwin and Washing-
ton and Lee have always had
close social ties, but I believe
that we would have to recon-
sider those ties if coeducation
comes to light. We are close to
Hampden-Sydney also because
of our Presbyterian ties,’’ said

Kris Milker, admissions
counselor at Mary Baldwin Col-
lege.

The Director of Public Rela-
tions for Sweet Briar agrees
that the social environment
would change.

“One can only speculate as to
the effect of coeducation
academically, but socially I’m
sure it would be there. Sweet
Briar students spend a great
deal of time with W&L students,
and women at the W&L campus
would affect that to some ex-
tent,” said Janet Lowry.

“As you well know, Randolph-
Macon and W&L are socially
active. But I’m sure that with
other girls around, that might
change,”’ said Bill Driskill,
Associate Director of Admis-
sions at Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College.

None of the schools believe
coeducation at W&L would lead
to coeducation at their schools.

“The applicant who looks at
Mary Baldwin definitely looks
at it because it is all-women. If
W&L were to go coed, I don’t
think it would force us to go
coed,’’ Milker said.

Driskill agreed. ‘‘I doubt we
would have to consider going
- coed. We are a traditional
school, just as W&L is. But we
are deeply committed to the
principles and ideals behind
women’s education,”’ he said.

That same committment to
principles and ideals in
women’s education also holds
true for Hollins College.

“Let me make one thing
clear! (W&L’s going coed)
would not force Hollins to go
coed. We would hope that what-

ever the outcome, there would
still be a close relationship bet-
ween the schools,”’ said Sandra
Loveinguth, Director of Admis-
sions for Hollins.

Loveinguth wondered what
type of woman would attend
W&L.

“‘Would the type of woman at-
tracted to W&L be the type of
woman W&L men would want to
date?’’ she asked. ‘‘What type
of woman would be attracted to
W&L?”

The question of traditional,
all-male education means much
more to neighboring women’s
colleges than most would
believe.

“We use W&L, Hampden-
Sydney and VMI as selling
points in the admission process,
and with W&L coed, that would
change, drastically,’ said
Driskill.

“There’s just a_ historical
tradition to your institution, an
all-male tradition. I don’t think
Hollins is threatened by coedu-
cation, but concerned we are.
We would think thoughtful
men’s colleges should exist to
complement women’s colleges.
The role of the all-male college
is as distinctive a role as ours
is,’’ said Loveinguth. “It takes
judicious planning.”

The academic effect on other
schools is of great concern to
the neighboring schools. While
fewer high school graduates are
attending college, many more
women are opting for higher
education. Competition for top
students will heat up, admis-
sions counselors at the
neighboring women’s colleges
predict.

“‘W&L would skim the cream !

off our applicant pool, and I fear
the academic students might be
lost,”’ said Loveinguth, citing
past gains in average SAT
scores as typical of Hollins’
growth in the academic realm.

‘While it is conceivable that
applications might drop off, I
doubt that it would. Enrollment
is at its second highest in the
history of Sweet Briar. In that
sense, it might not necessarily
affect us,” Lowrey said.

Each of the women’s colleges,
however, admits the real effect
of W&L’s going coed is pure
speculation.

“It is hard to anticipate ex-
actly what the effect would be.
However, we need to remember
that the strength of each of the
schools in the area is derived
from the strengths of all of the
schools, and Washington and
Lee’s going coed would mean
some strength would be lost,’’
Loveinguth said.

According to VMI officials, there will be no women in the ranks in the near future.

 

Hampden-Sydney, VMI look on

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Although neither Virginia .

Military Institute nor Hamp-
den-Sydney College currently
has any plans to abandon its all-
male status, officials at
Hampden-Sydney said that they
are keeping track of the coedu-
cation issue.

“‘We’re monitoring the situa-
tion, but at this moment we
don’t have any high-level com-
mittee studying it,’’ Lewis
Drew, the dean of students at
Hampden-Sydney, said.

Drew said that about 18
months ago a study group had
recommended that Hampden-
Sydney remain all-male for the
foreseeable future. The pro-
hibitive cost of going coed was
the main reason for the deci-
sion, Drew said.

Hampden-Sydney officals
also realize that demographic
trends show that there will be a
sharp drop in the number of

    
 
 
   
  

persons of college age in the
next decade, Drew said. The
college is trying to broaden its
recruiting base in order to
make up for this, he said.

Roughly 52 percent of. this
year’s freshman class at
Hampden-Sydney are Virginia
residents, Drew said. A large
percentage of: the non-Virgin-
ians come from states that
border Virginia, Drew added.

“We've set records for ap-
plications in the last two years.
But the worst years are yet to
come,” Drew said.

W. Sydnor Settle, the chair-
man of the Board of Trustees of
Hampden-Sydney, said that the
Board has supported attempts
to broaden the college’s re-
cruiting area.

“For whatever reason, the
college has a tradition of draw-
ing most of its students from
Virginia and bordering states,”
Settle said.

Both Drew and Settle said

“T really think that you might

no right or wrong about it,’’ Set-

of the coed question.

“I think we would probably
have to look at the issue again,”

‘Settle said concerning Hamp-

den-Sydney’s reaction to a
possible decision by Washing-
ton and Lee to go coed.

“As the number of all-male
colleges gets smaller, it might
seem more unique. It might
seem somewhat unusual,”’ Set-
tle said.

Drew said that if W&L went
coed, Hampden-Sydney would
have to ‘‘consider more closely
the coed issue.”” The necwork of
single-sex colleges in Virginia
provides a comfortable social
atmosphere that might be hurt
by a decision by W&L to go
coed, Drew said.

Alumni express divided opinions

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Recent telephone interviews
with a handful of prominent
Washington and Lee alumni
show that opinion is divided on
the coeducation question, with
few willing to lend whole-
hearted support to either posi-
tion in the debate.

Although most had a strong
idea of their general sentiments
about such a change, a hesitant
sense of doubt pervaded the
- responses. Peter A. Agelasto III
(62), president of the 17-
member Alumni Board of Di-
rectors, said ‘“‘it’s a little pre-
mature” to have an opinion on
the question. ‘I speak for the
alumni. I need to be as aloof as I
possibly can so that I can make
a responsible evaluation,’”’ he
said.

The Norfolk lawyer con-
tinued, “I think what’s being
done from the University’s
standpoint is to educate every-
body. This is a very important

question for the alumni, the —

students and the University.”

“This is definitely not an
adversary proceeding,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’re all on the same
side of the fence. It’s just that
we represent different consti-
tuencies.”’

Agelasto said he believes he
can accurately speak for the
University’s alumni when he
submits his written recommen-
dation on the coeducation ques-
tion later this year. ‘I think the
Alumni Board is a big, diverse
group, and I think it will be
representative. A day doesn’t
go by that we don’t get input
from somebody.”’

He emphasized, however that
he ‘‘wouldn’t recommend for a
minute that we send out a post-
card asking for everybody’s
opinion.”’ ;

“T think it’s a question of
education,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s awful-
ly hard to keep the emotional-
ism out of the argument. You
get that on both sides. It’s not

black and white. It’s very
gray.”
He concluded by adminishing

the reporter, ‘I don’t think
anybody you contact ought to
give you a response with enough
meat to digest.”

William C. Norman Jr. (’56),
vice-president of the Alumni
Board, said, ‘‘I would anticipate
that any decision by the Board
of Trustees or the administra-
tion would be made in the in-
terest of what is going to be
needed to ensure the survival of
W&L into the next century.

“That’s a pretty heavy re-
sponsibility. I would not pre-
judge any decision that would
be made.”

However, he said, ‘‘If there’s
any possible way that the school
could survive as an all-male in-

West Virginia, Army and the
University of Virginia.

“There was all this hue and
cry from the students and the
alumni. We felt we’d been be-
trayed. But it was absolutely
the right decision,’’ he said.

According to Norman, ‘‘Ma-
jor changes are in the short run
disruptive. Unfortunately,
there is only one generation
that’s going to suffer the conse-
quences of this, and that’s
yours.

“It’s easy for me to take a
liberal viewpoint — and I’m not

I have no problem with being one

of five schools in our position.”

 

stitution, I’d be the first to say

that it was folly to try to change
that.’
The Crossett, Ark., bank

president said that an Alumni
Leadership Conference held in
Lexington last month was ‘‘the

first indication we had that the -

current administration might
be moving very rapidly toward
a resolution of this problem.”’

Norman said he was meeting
with a group of Arkansas alum-
ni over the weekend, and said
that ‘‘it’ll come as a big shock to
many of the alumni, I’m sure.”’

At the Alumni Leadership
Conference, the administration
gave a presentation which some
interpreted as being pro-coedu-
cation.

“T think it is possible that we
were not given and have not
been presented a totally balanc-
ed view if there is an opposing
constituency,’’ Norman
ackowledged.

Norman said his main con-
cern is that ‘‘I want that school
to survive. I think the debate
that is going on is healthy. All
opposing sides should be allow-
ed to present their point of
view.”

He pointed out that change
has racked the institution
before. As an example, he cited
the dropping of subsidized ath-
letics when he was a student.

At the time, W&L was playing
football with such schools as

saying I favor that.

“It would disrupt a pattern of
life and living that you folks
have out there now. That would
be extremely unfortunate. I’m
wrestling with that.”’

William E. Latture (’49),
treasurer of the Alumni Board,
had originally agreed to ex-
press his views on coeducation
for publication.

When he was contacted again,
however, he said, “Since we
talked last, I’ve received a com-
munication’’ asking him not to
speak with The Ring-tum Phi.
He said he would ‘‘prefer not to
say’’ who had made the request.

“‘We are in the process of for-
mulating our opinions,”’ he said.
“T don’t feel free to discuss it.
We will be submitting a report
by December. We feel this is
what’s in the best interest of the
University.”

James M. Slay Jr. (’65, ’71L),
chairman of the Alumni Admis-
sions Program for the ‘Del-
marva”’ (Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia) region, said, ‘I’m not
sure there’s any way for the
trustees to know (the effects of
coeducation) short of trying it.

“If they do that, and they’re
wrong, then it’s going to be too
late. They’re going to make sort
of a god-like decision.”’

“T’m not convinced that
there’s not a market for an all-

men’s school,” he said. “It -

frankly strikes me as being
change for change’s sake.”’
Slay, who concentrates his
recruiting efforts in the Eastern
Shore area, brought seven
freshmen to the class of 1987.
“‘We have never had any pro-

blem with boys being turned off
by the single sex. They’re much
more likely to be turned off by
geography or the expense.

“In fact, many of them like
the idea of not having women
around during the week and
then having big party week-
ends. That’s the same attitude I
had when I went up there from
Richmond.”

“We are unique,”’ he said. ‘‘I
have no problem with being one
of five schools in our position.

“When I go out and sell the
school, I’m selling a spirit, and
a lot of that is the spirit that I
experienced when I went there.

“Maybe we’ll lose that with
coeducation. Perhaps coeduca-
tion will improve it. I don’t
know.”

Slay praised the Admissions
Office for the assistance it gives
him, and says his W&L ex-
perience has been invaluable to
him. ‘‘The whole school is like a
big fraternity after you gradu-
ate,” he said.

The contacts are so helpful,
he said, that in legal circles,
people talk of ‘the W&L
Mafia.”

This could be lost-with coedu-
cation, according to Slay.
“Under the guise of academic

coeducation.

“The Admissions Office can
quantify demographic trends.
The people who are in favor of
coeducation have lots of dry,
empirical data.

“The way they respond, the
undergraduates trivialize their

position. An observer sees it as
cold, hard facts versus buf-
foonery.

“There’re a lot of good, sound
arguments that could be mus-
tered in opposition to coeduca-
tion. A rational defense is possi-

ble. But they’re probably
outgunned in the assembly of
data and cogent arguments.”’
Slay was also extremely
displeased by what he saw at
the fraternity houses he visited.

“They were given enough rope
to hang themselves with, and
they did,’’ he stated.

With these actions, Slay said,
“The people in the fraternities
may have just played into the
hands of those on the faculty
who want to close them down.”’

I. Langston Donkle III (’74),
Alumni Admissions Program
chairman for the South Caro-
lina/Piedmont region, said he
“would generally be opposed
to’’ coeducation at W&L.

 

“I think it’s a question of education.

It’s awfully hard to keep

the emotionalism out of the argument.

You get that on both sides.”

 

excellence, We could be losing
something even more valua-
ble,” Slay stated.

One proposal involves _in-
creasing the size of the school if
women are added. ‘‘I’d certain-
ly be opposed to raising the size
of the school, whether it’s coed
or single sex,”’ Slay said.

At the Alumni Conference,
Slay said, W&L President John
D. Wilson ‘‘was careful not to
state his views to us. I don’t

doubt him, and he says he
hasn’t made up his mind yet.”’
Slay was critical of the me-
thods he saw used by under-
graduate students opposed to

‘1 saw them try it at schools
like Davidson, Sewanee, Dart-
mouth and Virginia, and it
didn’t seem to work out at all as
they planned,”’ he observed.

Donkle said that the respon-
sibility for dealing with the
shrinking applicant pool lies
with the Admissions Office.

“If they’ll get out and do their
work and meet with the pro-
spective students, they can
overcome their apprehension
and misunderstanding’ about
the single-sex environment.
“It’s something we can easily
work with,’’ he said.

“They need to recruit more
intensely if we’re going to get
the quality of students we’re ac-
customed to. We need intelli-
gent, personable and im-
pressive people in admissions.

“IT need more help. I frankly
don’t get the help that I need
from admissions...I can tell the
difference.”’

Donkle said he thinks Direc-
tor of Admissions William M.
Hartog ‘‘might be a little more
cut and dried about admissions
— a little less personable’’ than
the previous director.

“IT see no reason for’’
coeducation, he concluded.

Wilson:

Copyright 1983,
The Ring-tum Phi

The Ring-tum Phi- You've
been president of Washington
and Lee since January, what
are your feelings about the
university in general?
President John Wilson- Well, I
have a very positive feeling
about Washington and Lee. I
think it was, from my point of
view, a very happy day when I
was elected in August...

I am immensely impressed
with the quality of the people
here. The faculty are superb
people to be with. The staff I
have inherited I think is full of
lovely, decent people. They are
also great characters and good
human beings. I think that’s
true of the students too...I think
the civility and the decency of
our students is impressive. So I
am enjoying it a lot, frankly. I
am stimulated by it every day.
Phi- During your interviews
with the Board, presumably the
question of coeducation was
raised. What was your initial
reaction when the Board of
Trustees asked you about coed-
ucation?

Wilson- Well, I was asked
about my attitudes in general,
not in the particular context of
Washington and Lee. I had to
say this, that I was a student in
a coeducational undergraduate
institution, large and public.
Then I was a student in an all-

male institution — essentially
private — though Oxford Uni-
versity is a very mixed institu-
tion in the terms of its support
but it was fundamentally a
small, private, superior-quality
kind of place, all-male. Then I
turned out later to be president
of a college for women-single-
sex (Wells College) and I de-
fended the single-sex institution
as vigorously as I could from
the perspective of the female as
opposed to a male institution.
And then I — of course — went
from there as you know to a
large public setting (Virginia
Tech) again where I was chiefly
taken up with the academic pro-
gram and relationships with
faculty...So it wasn’t an issue at
VPI though it had been in the
60s. VPI was also all male until
1963. So I knew a lot about what
they had gone through.

Back in the period at Wells, I
read every report that was ever
published on coeducation by the
major private institutions that
were then thinking about it. It
was necessary for me as a pres-
ident of a single-sex college to
become very much acquainted
with the literature and I
published a few articles on the
question of single-sex (educa-
tion). I thought frankly in 1982
when I came to Washington and
Lee that the question was rela-
tively moot. I didn’t think it was
a burning question. After all

 

“I thought frankly in 1982 when I

came to Washington and Lee that

the question was relatively moot.”

these decisions were made 10 or
12 years ago in most institu-
tions. The decision was made at
Washington and Lee in 1972 or
so to permit women to the law
school and they were happily
accomodated there... ©

When I had my first press
conference I wasn’t five min-
utes into the press conference
before that question was asked.
I said to the Board and I said at
the press conference that I
thought that...the success of an
institution was certainly to be
taken into account as well as
how well it had succeeded over
the years. How many genera-
tions of young people had it
prepared to go out into the
world they inherited and to suc-
ceed in that world? That if there
were to be a shift, to play with
the characteristics of an institu-
tion, the proof surely would rest
upon those who advocated a
significant shift. I still believe
that’s true... There were many
more concerns expressed by
faculty and by some students
about the total quality of life at
Washington and Lee... Now I
could have stopped them. I
could have said, ‘Look, that
issue has been settled. I don’t
care to take it up.’ I was trying
to learn about the university so
I didn’t really cut them off... So
obviously I probably — as a new
person whose views weren’t
known, whose views were still
being formed in fact — I pro-
bably turned out to be more of a
catalyst than I realized to this
whole process of self-examina-
tion.

So I didn’t bring the issue of
coeducation to Washington and
Lee, the Western World has
brought it to all of us. When my
Oxford College, which was
established in 1314, decided that
it could no longer sensibly
restrict its enrollment to men
alone in 1975, I knew that
something very serious was
afoot...

I tried to say to Lem Tucker
(CBS News Reporter) the other
day when CBS was up here with
the red light on, Washington
and Lee isn’t Amherst, it isn’t
Princeton, it isn’t Yale, it isn’t
Davidson. It’s its own special
place. It has its own great
characters in its past and in its
present. It has quintessentially
Robert E. Lee and what he
stood for and the values that he
represents and continues to
represent here and one has to
make, if one can, a calculation
of how translatable those values
are into a_e different
undergraduate setting... The
question is, what is the female
presence at W&L? Is it good
that it should be strictly social,
strictly weekend and mid-week
social events where women are
present here, where the serious
work of the university, its col-
lege, is reserved for men? So
the people who advocate
coeducation here say it isn’t to

Improved Intellectual

increase the presence of women
here, it is to change the nature

‘of the presence of women here

and therefore to change the en-
vironment in ways they think
will be constructive and helpful
for the young men as well as the
young women who are going to
be going out into a very dif-
ferent, changed world.

Phi- You have had a chance to
observe academic and social
life here at Washington and Lee
for a year now. Has your at-
titude toward coeducation
changed during that course of
time?

Wilson- Well, not my attitude
about how the matter should be
approached. I think it should be
approached in the most. ra-
tional, intelligent, thoughtful,
sober way it could possibly be
approached. And I feel a genu-
ine responsibility to ensure as
much as I can that that be done.
I cannot stop bumper stickers
or banners to be flown ... that’s
part of the fun and zest of an in-
teresting, important conversa-
tion.

But I do feel an obligation to
contrive as objective an assess-
ment as we can of what is to be
lost and what is to be gained,
what is at stake, what is at
risk...SO my own. attitudes
about it, I am going to reserve,
frankly... If I don’t come
through the next few months
with some of my attitudes
shaped, changed, altered,
modified in one way or another,
then I will have not been very
observant...

So I am still learning about
Washington and Lee. There are
some people who say ‘How dare
he, how dare he indeed, with on-
ly seven months, come in here

 

‘I didn’t bring the issue of (

and advocate Coeducation?’

that’s a simplistic way of look-
ing at it.

Phi- Whose decision was it to
raise the question of coeduca-
tion this seriously? Was it your
decision or the Board’s deci-
sion?

Wilson- Well, the Board at the

meeting - just concluded — as
you know — formally took steps

to ask that the matter be
seriously re-examined...

I said in the spring at the
Alumni Association meeting in
Lee Chapel “I do not believe
that a serious re-examination
can be avoided, much as you
would like to hear me say that it
can be avoided.”’ So it is cer-
tainly true to say that I have
recommended that this matter
be taken off the table and re-
examined...

We cannot go into this decade
blithely skipping through the
tulips, assuming that all is go-
ing to be well and that we’ll
have our 1,325 undergraduate
men. It’s just not going to hap-
pen unless we cause it to hap-
pen... If we decide to remain all
male at the undergraduate
level, then some very extraor-
dinary things are going to have
to happen in order to protect the
quality of this place and I don’t

know what all those are yet. So
it’s part of trying to take stock
and that’s what I am for. That’s
what any president must do. To
try to plan what needs to be
done in order to secure a
stronger, better Washington
and Lee. That’s the only thing
that is important here. Not me
or my feelings or you and your
feelings or the alumni’s feelings
about this. Those are all part of
a mosaic. But it’s all part of try-
ing to figure out what is in the
best interest of this University.

Phi- Eventually you will make
a recommendation about coedu-
cation to the Board. How big a
factor is tradition in that recom-
mendation?

Wilson- The point about tradi-
tion is I think it’s silly to say
that anything that was here 234
years ago must remain. Be-
cause then you would be
reading Livy, Suetonius,
Herotodotus and Thucydides
and you wouldn’t be remotely
connected up with the courses
and curriculum. But you have
to inquire beneath the label
“What is meant by Tradition?
What is exactly at stake here?
Now when people say ‘‘Well, the
Honor System.”’ That’s the first
thing that comes to mind of
those who invoke tradition...

programs change that?...

You start out with a defini-
tion of Washington and Lee as a
first-rate university; national in
scope, pretentions to the highest
quality, successful alums, etc.
That’s the definition of Wash-
ington and Lee. That’s the in-
stitution most of you applied to.
To what extent did you also app-
ly because it was all male?
Since coming — whether in
spite of that or because of it
—you have become fond of the
place, you see how it works, and
you like how it works, and that’s
associated with its gender. Can
you untangle that in some kind
of intellectual exercise to see
whether or not what matters
most would survive or whether
what matters most would in
some way be changed.

Phi- When you make your
recommendation regarding co-
education to the Board, whose
opinion — student or faculty or
alumni — will you consider the
most?

Wilson- When I make a recom-
mendation to the Board, I am
going to have to make it in a
way that I can live with. it.
That’s first and foremost...

I would have to say that the
faculty who are here now who
know the University well and
have committed their lives to
the University and who are re-
sponsible for its chief activity
and especially those who were
also students here...I am going
to pay special attention to the
law faculty who were here be-
fore and who took their under-
graduate degrees here and who
have seen coeducation in that
context. And I am going to pay

 

attention to key emeritus
trustees as well as the current
trustees and I am going to be
obviously interested in key
donors and alumni who have
been responsible and who love
the place, who have given
money to it. I am going to pay
attention to what they have to
say. And then I am going to try
to tap into responsible student
leaders... And then I am going
to trust my own judgments.

Phi- You say you are going to
consider key alumni. What goes
through your mind when you
get a letter from Supreme Court
Justice Lewis Powell?

Wilson- Well, I take Mr.
Powell very seriously. He is a
thoughtful man. He enclosed in
his letter — I don’t think it
would be wrong to say — a copy
of his dissent in the Mississippi
Women’s College case and
made a point about diversity in
American higher education and
his hope that it would remain a
diverse system. I replied to that
letter in some length and tried
to explain to him some of the
things that were being raised
here in the Washington and Lee
context. He has since replied to
me to say that he was grateful
for my thoughtful letter and
that I had raised some points
that he hadn’t considered and
that dialogue will continue.

Phi- When do you think that
this issue will be decided?
Wilson- May may be too early.
The Board may judge other-
wise. I have said to the Board
that I hope that we do not have
to carry this over into another
academic year. Let’s try to
work within that framework
and see how we come out. I hope
I am in a position to take a posi-
tion in May and don’t ask me be-
fore the Board meeting.

Phi- How far are you away
from making your decision?
Wilson- Well, I am still trying
to find out how students truly
think about it. We have got to
get beyond the bumper sticker.
And I have got to get with the
faculty and get their considered
views... 1 am half way there in
the sense that I believe the mat-
ter requires serious examina-
tion.

Phi- Are you an advocate of
coeducation?

Wilson- No, I am not going to
declare that. Iam going to be an
advocate for what I think is best
for Washington and Lee and the
Board is then going to have to
make a judgment about that
and they will then finally make
a decision based on what they
collectively think is best for
Washington and Lee. I am not
an ideologue when it comes to
coeducation, I didn’t come here
saying the first and foremost
thing we must do is change this
institution. I would not have
come here. Why would I have
come here? I was happy in my
work... I came to Washington
and Lee because it is a first-rate
institution and I wanted to be

associated and have something
to do with a first-rate institution
and to be president of a first-
rate institution with such
memorable people who have
been here before me. All of that
is immensely attractive and
satisfying. I didn’t come think-
ing it’s deeply flawed in its cen-
tral characteristic. I have bet-
ter things to do than take on
15,000 alumni and 1,325 under-
graduates and 350 law students
— you don’t come for that. But
you don’t shrink from issues
that seem to be important to
people and that seem to mat-
ter...

I have no choice but to look at
coeducation seriously and any-
body in my position would.

Phi- Is this just an academic
problem, or does it become an
economic problem?

Wilson- To be sure there are
financial implications to the
problem of contraction. If you
are going to reduce your fresh-
‘man class by 25 percent, and
then over four years reduce the
total undergraduate student
population by 25 percent, you
are compelled to do that in
order to keep some modicum of
standards. Then you are not
able to contract your faculty the
same way. Then you have a fi-
nancial problem to be sure; an
acute one, a serious one.

Phi- During your time here as
president you have raised such

controversial questions as
coeducation, fraternities and
housing. Do you feel that rais-
ing these questions has
alienated you from members of
the university community?
Wilson- I don’t in any way
shrink or apologize for raising
those questions. I think that’s
my job. I do have the human
weakness of not wanting to be
desperately dislikes, and that is
troublesome because I think in
some cases I am thought to be
meddling without license in
things I don’t understand —
either through ‘ignorance or in-
experience’ I believe is the
phrase — and that’s trouble-
some...I don’t go through life
saying that everything I do, say
or may be or stand for is going
to be universally applauded.
Especially in a position like this
where I happen to be the focal
point of a lot of interests, some
of them not entirely compati-
ble...No, I don’t like not to be
liked. I like to feel that what I
am doing is understood and gen-
erally approved of, but I fully
realize that I will not satisfy
everybody. I only hope one
thing and that is my motives
are not suspect, that I am not
thought to have some hidden
ideological agenda.

Other coed schools cite improvements
R-MC, Sewanee, Davidson compared to WGL

- By TODD SMITH
Staff Reporter

Comparisons between W&L
and three similar universities
— Randolph-Macon in Ashland,
The University of the South and
Davidson College — seem to in-
dicate that recent conversions
to coeducation have improved
the schools and that they have
not consequently suffered from
a fall of alumni support.

“As for overall impact, it’s .

probably the greatest thing
Randolph-Macon ever did,’’ Ad-
missions Director John Conk-
right of Randolph-Macon said.

The University of the South at
Sewanee, Tenn., “‘has been
nicer,” Dean of Men Doug
Seiters said. “It’s a more nor-
mal community with a better
social situation,”’ he said.

Davidson vs. W&L

The situation of Davidson Col-
lege, Davidson, N.C., is most
comparable to that of Washing-
ton and Lee, according to W&L
Dean of Students Lewis John
and Associate Dean of Admis-
sions at Davidson Gardner
Roller.

‘‘We were drawing from ex-
actly the same applicant pool,
we had the same quality stu-
dents,’’ Ms. Roller said. In 1971
the two schools accepted about
60 percent of applicants in order
to fill their freshman classes,

although Davidson had ac-
cepted a lower percentage
throughout the 1960s.

Since coeducation in 1972,
Davidson has surged ahead, ac-
cording to W&L admissions
figures. Davidson now accepts
35 percent of its applicants to
get enough to fill up its
freshman class; because only
41 percent of W&L’s accepted
students will matriculate, W&L
must accept 57 percent of its ap-
plicants. In other words, David-
son extends admission to fewer
applicants because it knows
three in five will accept; W&L
can only count on two in five
coming.

Another yardstick is SATs, in
which Davidson led W&L by
roughly 20 points in 1971;
Davison now leads by 100
points, according to W&L ad-
mission figures.

Ms. Roller believes that the
effect of coeducation ‘‘is entire-
ly positive. The applicant pool
has increased dramatically and
the quality has also improved,”
she said. ‘‘The change has been
more rapid in the last five or six
years as the concentration of
women has increased.”’

“The world has changed and
single-sex education is no
longer in vogue,” Ms. Roller
said. ‘‘As a result, students
have begun to seek out coed en-
vironments.”

“If W&L was to make the

 

“The world has changed

and single-sex education

is no longer in vogue.”

decision in favor of coeduca-
tion, we would be competing for
the same students in a very
short time,”’ she said.

Davidson’s trustees made the
decision to admit women as
degree candidates in May of
1972, after a poll showed that a
substantial majority of stu-
dents, faculty, staff and alumni
favored the move.

According to Dr. Julius
Melton of the Davidson develop-
ment office, alumni giving did
not drop off after coeducation.
In fact, the unrelated instiga-
tion of an annual giving cam-
paign drove alumni funding up.

Because alumni were in favor
of coeducation from the start,
and because there would be no
displacement of men by wom-
en, Melton found little alumni

resentment. He has never met -

an alumnus disgruntled over

"the issue, he said.
‘
As planned, the admission of

women would not have displac-
ed men because total enroll-
ment would have increased
from 1000 to 1500. In reality,
Melton said declining applicant
pools have kept enrollment at
around 1400 — 900 men, 500
women.

“I got here about the time
coeducation began,” Melton
said. ‘‘We have been consistent-
ly going up ever since.”

Sewanee’s intangibles

At Sewanee, Dean of Men and
alumnus Doug Seiters mea-
sures the impact of coeducation
in less quantitative ways, and
yet defends coeducation. “I
have always been a supporter of
the change. For our isolated
community it was necessary,”
Seiters said.

Coeducation “‘had a leveling
effect. When I was a student in
1965 there were three big
weekends when women were
here, and otherwise we just sat

around the fraternity house and
listened to the juke box, and
thought about how miserable
we were,”’ he said.

“We liked to think, as you
may, that being different was
part of the distinctive charm of
the school. But the social life is
much healthier and less abnor-
mal now.

“There was something in-
tangible that was lost...There
was a kind of closeness among
students and faculty that’s not
the same today.

“A lot of it (the closeness)
was out of necessity, too. You
just didn’t go out on a date, so
you socialized with your pro-
fessors more,’’ he said.

Sewanee’s applicant pool had
shrunk so greatly during the
1960s that in 1968 over 90 per-
cent of the applicants -were of-
fered admission. Since coeduca-
tion in September of 1969, the
number of applications has
shown an overall increase.

“It seemed to me that it was a
total breath of fresh air,” said
Oliver Marcus, director of an-
nual giving at Sewanee. ‘‘The
girls hit the ground running.
Within a year or two the
valedictorian was a girl...It was
a civilizing influence of a

~ serious magnitude.”

Marcus found annual giving
to increase between 1968 and
1969, despite any chilling effect
of coeducation on alumni.
‘There was no serious reaction
that could be measured in gifts
atall.”

“‘T think there was a residual :

regret that the world was mov-
ing on and that it was necessary
to change in order to maintain
quality,’”’ Marcus said. But ‘99
percent of the alumni under-
stood and approved,”’ excluding
the “crabby individuals who
say, ‘I hate change even if it’s
for the better.’ ”

John Conkright, Director of
Admissions at Randolph-
Macon, finds a similar re-
sponse. ‘I am sure the majority
of alumni are realistic and saw
it (coeducation) was an ex-
cellent decision.”

Like Sewanee, Randolph-
Macon’s declining pull on ap-
plicants suggested financial
danger. The trustees voted in
January 1971 to plunge into
coeducation the following
September.

“The transition was not
traumatic at all. Now the
women contribute to the life of
the college in every way,”
Conkright said. Most of the
students who earn academic
scholarships are women, he
noted.

Conkright in turn asked about
coeducation as an issue at W&L.
News that a change may be in
the offing has obviously moved
through the network of
Southern college administra-
tions, especially through admis-
sions and development offices.

“‘T think the fact that it comes
up over and over again (at

W&L) means it won’t go away,”
Conkright said.
