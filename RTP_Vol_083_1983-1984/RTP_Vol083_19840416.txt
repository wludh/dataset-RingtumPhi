Student killed in fire

Fu

house destroyed

by Wednesday blaze

By MIKE ALLEN

Staff Reporter
Washington and Lee
sophomore Thomas John

Fellin, an honor student and
member of the varsity baseball
team, was killed Wednesday in
a pre-dawn fire which
destroyed the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity house.

Fellin, 19, was co-president of
the fraternity and co-chairman
of the Pennsylvania delegation
to the Mock Democratic Con-
vention. He was on the honor
roll and was a member of Phi
Eta Sigma, the freshman
scholastic honor society.

The fire, which was
discovered at 4:45 a.m., gutted
the three-story building, leav-
ing only the limestone walls and
a pile of charred, mangled rub-
ble.

The cause of the blaze, which
took three hours to control, has
not been determined.

Fellin, whose room was on the
second floor at the front of the
house, is believed to have been
the only occupant of the house.
The school was on spring break.

nity who was asleep in an ad-

joining building,
through a window.
Lexington Fire Chief Keith Ir-
vine, an electrician for W&L,
said that the building was “a

escaped

total loss,’’ and estimated the
damage at at least $200,000.

‘Because the building’s been
destroyed, it’s going to be very
difficuit to determine the
cause,’ he said.

He said that five fire trucks
and about forty volunteer
firefighters, including units
from nearby Buena Vista, bat-
tled the blaze. The entire force
was on the scene shooting water
into the smoldering re-
mains of the house until late in
the morning.

The victim was pulled from
the flaming house at about 5:15
a.m. by David W. Stevens Jr., a
W&L senior who has been a
Lexington Fire Department
volunteer for four years.

Stevens said that Fellin was
on a Staircase and less than six
feet from an exit when he ap-
parently was overcome by
smoke and heat and fell.

‘‘We thought there was a per-
son in the house,’’ Stevens said.
“I went in to do a search and
rescue....his head was on the se-
cond stair’’ from the door of the
side exit which faces the adjoin-
ing building.

Positive identification of the
victim was made by the state
medical examiner in Roanoke
using dental records.

Fire Chief Irvine said the
weight of the water and falling
debris weakened the floor
joists, causing most of the
building’s floors and ceilings to
fall through to the basement.

He said the construction of
the cement-rock house made
the. fire unusually difficult to
fight.

“The stone walls confined the
heat so that our men couldn't go
inside,’ he said. ‘‘After we got
the victim out, we couldn’t go
back in.”’

“Also, the slate roof was an
extreme hazard,’ he added
‘The falling, sharp edges were
very dangerous for the men.”

Unscorched trees against the
front of the house attested to the
confinement of the heat, which
Stevens said was extraordi-
narily intense.

A charred fragment of the
slate tile could be seen deeply
lodged in a wooden railing at
the front of the building.

The building Forte was sleep-
ing in, a former house mother’s
quarters which is connected to
the main house by a covered
porch, suffered only water and
smoke damage.

The contents of one room in
the southwest corner of the
second floor were salvageable.
Firemen could be seen Wednes-
day afternoon carrying the
possessions of senior Carlton
Peebles, including stereo
speakers and a television, out of
the wreckage

‘We were just able to get

enough water in the right place
at the right time,”’ Irvine said.

Some items in the kitchen
may also be salvageable.

The wooden fire escape on the
south side of the building was
undamaged. Fire fighters and
photographers walked up and
down it all day on Wednesday.

One fire truck returned to the
scene at 5:45 a.m. on Thursday
when from his window a nearby
resident saw first smoke and
then a flame in the debris

Irvine said it was not unusual
for a large quantity of charred
wood to re-ignite

Members of the fire depart-
ment worked Thursday and Fri-
day removing debris from the
structure, aftempting to ascer-
tain the cause of the fire

Lexington Police Chief L.O
Sutton, who is trained in arson
investigation, was on the site to

assist in ‘‘determining the
cause and origin of the fire.’
'T suspect it will be some

time before we determine
anything conclusive,’’ Sutton
said.

The remaining structure will
probably have to be torn down
because the limestone blocks
have been ‘‘spalled’? — weak-
ened to the point that the walls

are unsound.

| Service tomorrow

A memorial service for Tom
Fellin will be held at 11:40 a.m.
tomorrow in Lee Chapel.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
Jobn said that classes will not
be cancelled.

University Chaplain David W.
Sprunt said the program will be
“simple and brief.”

Tf we goin now, we ‘re going down’

By MIKE ALLEN

At 4:45 Wednesday morning, I
was sitting at my typewriter in
the corner room of the third
floor of the Sig Ep house. For
several minutes, I’d heard a
banging sound next door at the
Fiji house. I didn’t pay any at-
tention to it at first, but the
crashing noise continued.

It sounded like the racket the
trash people make when they
empty the dumpster on Fiji’s
side of our yard. I looked at the
clock. It was too early for that.
PEER

Eyewitness
Account

I went to my side windows
and looked out. There wasn‘t
anything going on in our yard.
Then I turned to the set of win-
dows which faces. our
neighbors. The entire back cor-
ner of the Fiji house was engulf-
ed in flames.

I grabbed the telephone but
couldn’t think of the police
department’s number, which I
dial several times every week
for stories.

I pushed ‘“‘O.”’ “How do I

report a fire?’’ I asked as if I
were three years old.

“‘What city is it in, sir?” the
operator asked.

“Lexington, ma’am.”’

“T’ll connect you,’’ she said.

After hanging up, I looked
around my room. Only one tree
separates our house from Fiji's,
and I fully expected that after I
left, I wouldn’t be coming back.

What’s important? What do
you take with you? At that
point, nothing mattered. I threw
on a jacket and grabbed a pad
and pen. I didn’t even have my
wallet.

I dashed down our fire
jescape. Sixty seconds had pass-
ed since I discovered the fire.

As I went down the outside
stairs and into the yard, I saw
Jim Forte, who had_ just
escaped through his window.
‘“‘Hey guy!’’he said. ‘‘Call the
fire department.”

“T have! Is anybody in the
house?’’ He wasn’t sure. There
were two cars in the yard. That
had to mean there were people.
He said one of the cars was his.
I looked at the burning house.
Somebody might be in there.

I made an initial attempt to
go in the back door, which was
right next to us, and was im-
mediately choked by the smoke.

Perhaps the car had been left
there over break. There was a
car in our yard, too, and the per-
son it belonged to was in South
Carolina. I knew there was no
point in going into the house if it
were empty, or if I was just go-
ing to get myself killed as well.

“Help me yell,” I said to Jim.
“T’ll go in if we know there’s
someone in there.”’

“Fire!” we shouted. ‘‘Fire!”’
And then: “Is there anybody
there? Is there anybody
there?”’

The only-reply was the crack-
ing of timbers and the shatter-
ing of roof tiles. I tried again to
go in the back door. Impossible.

The police arrived. It hadn’t
been five minutes since I put
down the receiver. Sergeant
Richard Rice got out of his car
and took charge. ‘“‘Get away
from the house,”’ he said.

“There might be someone in
there! We have to get them,” I
said frantically.

“It’s too late,” he replied. ‘‘I
want everyone away from the
building!”’

I mentally cursed the officer.
He was the cool professional. I
was the terrified kid who
thought there might be a human
being in there.

Officer Edward Funkhouser

and I went around to the front of
the house, shouting and hoping
to wake up anybody who might
be in the front — there weren’t
any flames there yet.

The two of us tried unsuc-
cessfully to go in the slightly
open front door. The thickest,
blackest smoke imaginable was
pouring out of the top of it.

I panicked and ran to the back
of the house.

“There’s someone in there,’’ I
shouted impulsively at
Sergeant Rice. ‘“‘We’ve got to go
in.”’

“If we go in now, we're going
down,” he said. “If there’s
someone in there, it’s too late to
do anything for them. It only
takes five seconds for it to go
up.”

Ignoring him, I went to the
front of the house. Officer
Funkhouser and I tried again to
see if we could get in the front
door. There was no way.

“IT want everybody back from
the building,” Sergeant Rice
screamed over the officer’s
walkie-talkie.

We went back around into the
yard. Between the houses, we
saw the first fire truck arriving
out front.

When there was nothing we
could do for anyone in Fiji, I
went back into our house, which

hadn’t been in danger, to get my
fraternity brother who was on
the second floor. He’d been
awakened by the noise.

“Is there anyone else in the
house?”’ I asked. We were both
certain there wasn’t.

I went back and stood in Fiji’s
front yard. After a few
minutes, I watched Dave
Stevens bring the victim out of
the house.

Moments later, I saw
Sergeant Rice standing next to
the body on the front lawn.

“If we’d gone in, we might
have saved him,’’ I said accus-
ingly.

We couldn’t have, of course —
the exit the trapped victim
could use had been consumed
by flames when I first saw the
fire. I just wanted someone to
yell at. Desperate people do
stupid things.

“You know what would have
happened if you’d gone in that
building?”’ the sergeant said.
‘In 15 seconds, you would have
been overcome by smoke.

“It’s an extremely dangerous
thing to enter a_ burning
building. Most of the time, you
don’t come out. We tried to go
in, but we couldn’t.”’

“It’s a tragedy,” he said as
we stood there watching the
house burn. “It’s a tragedy.”’

“T think it will have to be
razed,”’ Irvine said.

Early Wednesday morning,
professors, students and ad-
ministrators gathered in the
residential neighborhood begin-
ning shortly after the first fire
truck arrived.

Witnesses who viewed the
blaze in its intial stages said
that it appeared to have started
on the first or second floor in the
southeast corner of the
building.

Earl Poindexter, a W&L
security guard and member of
the rescue squad, said that
shortly before 5 a.m. he could
see the flames from in front of
Washington Hall on the Colon-
nade.

The baseball team, for which
Fellin was an outfielder, re-
turned shortly after midnight
Wednesday morning from play-
ing Virginia Wesleyan College
in Norfolk.

Most of Fellin’s teammates
learned of his death when they
gathered for their regular team
breakfast at 9:30 a.m. at the
Kappa Sigma house.

“Some of the guys had
already heard, but the majority
were told at breakfast,’’ head
coach James W. Murdock said.

Fellin’s number 27 jersey will
be retired. ‘We all decided on
that,’’ Murdock said. ‘“‘It wasn’t

just my decision — it was a

team decision.”’

The team attended the Satur-

day funeral at Sacred Heart
Roman Catholic Church in
Fellin’s hometown of Weston,
Pa., which is in the eastern part
of the state near Wilkes-Barre.

The coach said Wednesday
that Fellin had improved
dramatically this season, and
that he would have played quite
a bit this spring.

“Tommy has always been
hard-working and a tremendous
student,”” said Murdock, who
said Fellin’s grade point
average approached 4.0.

“He was never complacent
with his performance, and was
always trying to improve
himself,’’ he continued. ‘‘He
proved that this year by moving
from J.V. to the varsity team as
a sophomore.

‘He was continuously trying
to better himself both athlet-
ically and scholastically.

‘“‘He-was respected by myself
and the team. He was well-
liked, but not overly outgoing.
Tommy was trusting, loyal and
a very dependable friend.”’

“You can’t say anything bad
about the kid,” said Captain
Buddy Keller, who taught Fellin
in military science for two
semesters this year. ‘If he
didn’t get 100, he’d get a 99, no
matter what you asked him.”’

Richard B. Sessoms, director
of alumni programs for the
university and Fiji’s chapter
adviser, and Dan N. Nolen,
associate dean of students for
fraternity affairs, represented
the school at the funeral.

Sessoms said that Fellin

played a key role in the
reorganziation of Fiji this year.

‘“‘He and Alex Castelli have
been co-presidents,” he said.
“When the Alumni Board of
Control stepped in to try to
assist Phi Gam with the situa-
tion last fall, they appointed a
cabinet of leaders.

“Tommy and Alex, who were
close friends and roommates,
were regarded by people in the
house as natural leaders for the
future.”’

Fellin told The Ring-tum Phi
in January that the reorganiza-
tion had been very successful.

“Everyone is showing a lot of
enthusiasm and there is a big
group effort in everything we
do,” he said. ‘I think we spent
more time on Christmas decor-
ations than any other house on
campus.”’

‘He was a strong student and
had good leadership skills,’
Sessoms said. ‘‘He was a quiet
person. His was a quiet, very ef-

fective means of leadership. It
was leadership through
example.”

“I felt like I knew him as well
as anybody could possibly know
him,”’ said the adviser, who
lives diagonally across Jackson
Avenue from the fraternity.

“He was very highly ar-
ticulate. He didn’t do a lot of
talking, but when he did talk, he
really said something. That’s a
rare trait.”’

On Wednesday morning,
News Office Director Jeffery G.
Hanna reached University
President John D. Wilson, who

was traveling on business at
West Virginia University in
Morgantown.

“Words cannot express my
personal sadness,” President
Wilson said in a statement.
“This is simply a_ terrible
tragedy. This community has
suffered a tremendous loss.

“I feel deeply for Tom
Fellin’s family. My thoughts
and my prayers are with them.
I know I speak for everyone
connected with the university in
expressing our grief over this
tragedy.”

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John notified Fellin’s parents

 

 

FELLIN
Wednesday morning. He said he

spoke with both his father and
his mother, who were last in
Lexington during Parents’
Weekend this fall.

Dean John said that smoke
detectors are required on each
floor of the fraternity houses.

 

 

The fraternities complete
monthly inspection sheets of
fire safety equipment. The last
completed sheet for Phi Gam-
ma Delta is dated April 2.

Dean Murphy said that he and
Sessoms were notifying the
members of the fraternity.

He said that most of the 12
students who lived in the house
will be put in Baker Dormitory.
Some may be put in Woods
Creek Apartments.

Sessoms said Thursday that
nearly all of the fraternity
members had been contacted.
He said the reaction was
generally ‘‘stunned silence and
shock to hear that such a
tragedy had occurred.”’

He said a field representative
of the national fraternity, which
is based in Lexington, Ky., will
be in town when students return
on Sunday.

Sessoms said the house is ful-
ly insured. He said the coverage
was recently increased to
$385,000.

University Treasurer E.
Stewart Epley said the school
does not own the house or the
land. Fiji is one of only six
fraternities in which that is the
case.

He said a portion of the in-
surance money will go to the
university because it has two
loans to the fraternity still

outstanding.
The Zeta Deuteron chapter of
Phi Gamma Delta was

established at W&L in 1868, 116
years ago. It is the sixth oldest
fraternity on campus.
