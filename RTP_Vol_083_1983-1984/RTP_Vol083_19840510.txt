NUMBER 27 “

Washington and Lee University

Lexington, Virginia

May 10, 1984

 

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The number of guilty votes
needed to convict a defendant in
a public honor trial will be
reduced from eight to five if a
motion given initial approval by
the Executive Committee Tues-
day night is confirmed next
Tuesday.
The proposal was introduced
by Student Body President Bob
Jenevein, who expressed con-
cern that there is a lack of stu-
dent faith in the EC’s closed
honor hearing verdicts.
“Basically, our decision (in
the closed hearing) means
nothing if it goes to appeal,”
sophomore representative
James White said.
Three of the four students who
have appealed their cases to a
student body jury this year have
had their closed hearing convic-
tions overturned.
A second resolution passed in-
volves adding the word ‘‘Expel-
led’ to the transcript of a stu-
dent convicted in a public hear-
ing. Jenevein said that would
reduce the number of appeals of
closed hearing convictions
because a convicted student
might not want to risk having the
notation on his transcript.

But junior representative Bob
Tomaso objected that passing

 

EC proposes reducing
votes for conviction

both resolutions would be ‘‘a
step too far.”’

AS a compromise, a friendly
amendment was passed saying
that if the first resolution is con-
firmed Tuesday, when the EC is
required to vote on all White
Book revisions a second and
final time, the second resolution
would be dropped.

Jenevein began discussion of
the first proposal by reading a
letter from a faculty member
who was involved in an honor
trial this year.

“As the system now func-
tions,” the letter said, ‘‘a deci-
sion reached by these specially
chosen representatives (the EC)
can be reviewed and overturned
by a student jury randomly
selected. Indeed,... a mere five
members of a random jury can
overturn a conviction. Such an
arrangement is patently ab-
surd.”’

“T think ... you would do well to
treat an appeal from an EC judg-
ment not as a fresh start with the
burden of proof once again on
the prosecution. Rather, if you
wish to operate out of a random-
ly chosen review panel, require
that the appellant convince a
majority of the panelists that in-
justice has been done.”’

Noting that individual EC
members had previously dis-
cussed the difficulty of getting

...introduced open trial change
convictions in open trials, Jene-
vein said he strongly supported
the faculty member’s letter.

But junior representative and
President-elect Cole Dawson ex-
pressed a concern that a future
EC might become frustrated by
a lack of convictions and just
start “looking to kick someone
out.”

Senior representative George
Youmans disagreed, saying, ‘‘I
think it’s presumptuous to think
that an EC will ever be out to get
someone.’

The motion, which will put the
burden of getting a two-thirds
majority vote of the 12 jurors on
the defendant rather than on the
EC in public trials, was passed
7-1, with Secretary Jim Messer
against and Dawson abstaining.

The EC will meet again Tues-
day night for the final votes on

Alumni respond to coed poll

By JOHN CLEGHORN

Chief Editor

Approximately 40 percent of Washington and
Lee’s 16,500 current alumni have responded to an
extensive questionnaire on whether W&L should ad
mit women to its undergraduate program, accol
ding to Farris Hotchkiss, director of University

development and relations.

The results of the 117-question poll, which was
sent to all alumni in February, are being analyzed
by Southeastern Institute of Research in Richmond,
Va. and will first be released to the W&L Board of
Trustees at its May 25-26 meeting.

Questions on the poll cover general attitudes
about W&L, the University’s current academic
reputation, its size and traditions, and how coeduca-
tion would effect those elements of the school in the

opinions of the alumni.

‘It’s not a simple yes or no poll,’’ said Hotchkiss

ed.”’
Hotchkiss said

“It is a considerable amount of work.”

“I imagine what we'll find is that there are all
kinds of answers to coeducation,” he said. ‘‘The
survey is going to tell us a lot more about what our
alumni aspire to as far as this university is concern-

that some of the ‘traw, uninter-

preted data’’ from the poll will be given to the Alum-

New party rules

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

A set of guidelines for the pro-
posed student activities center,
including a clause limiting the
number of weekend parties that
can be held in each fraternity
house per term, will be
presented to the Board of
Trustees at its meeting in two
weeks.

“No more than four weekend
parties per term may be held in
any one house, with possible ex-
ceptions for Rush and Fancy
Dress,” the third section of the
guidelines states, although
fraternities co-sponsoring par-
ties at each other’s houses will
have an opportunity for more
parties.

Another section states that
‘*Tuesday Nights in the Pit’ will
be moved to Wednesday nights,
with Wednesday night fraternity
parties limited to members and
their dates.

Admitting that some of the
changes are ‘‘pretty drastic,”

i SAC to issue decision on changes

Student Body President Bob
Jenevein, who helped draw up
the plan with the Student Ac-
tivities Board and the Inter-
fraternity Council, said Tuesday
that the plan does not limit
fraternities as much as it seems.

‘In a 12-week term two houses
can get together and have eight
parties in their houses,’ Jene-
vein said, ‘‘and they still haven’t
partied out at the pavilion.”

SAB Treasurer John Haywood
said that the plan, passed by the
Student Affairs Committee two
weeks ago, will still allow frater-
nities to have parties every
weekend.

The pavilion, which is ex-
pected to cost over $500,000 and
to be built by October, still needs
final approval by the board.

“The idea behind (the guide-
lines) is to reduce the wear and
tear on the fraternities,’ Dean
Dan N. Murphy, an SAC
member, said, ‘‘which is ob-
viously a result of the very large
parties that sometimes take
place at fraternities now.”

Fire probe nears end

Officials investigating the fire
which destroyed the Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity house met into
the early afternoon today
without announcing a decision
on the cause of the blaze.

The investigation into the
cause and origin of the fire is in
its final stages and an announce-
ment is expected shortly. Addi-
tional laboratory tests on
materials from the house were
conducted early this week.

Review and Outlook

 

 

Patently Absurd

Four students convicted of honor violations this
year have appealed their convictions to student body
juries. Three of these students’ convictions have been
overturned by the student jurors.

The purpose of the public appeal is to prevent the
Executive Committee from becoming an omnipotent
body. A student convicted of an honor violation by the
EC has a chance to seek justice if he feels he has been
wronged.

Students must not abuse their right to public honor
hearings — a student should appeal his EC conviction
only if he knows he has not committed an honor viola-
tion.

Recognizing the problem of an abundance of open
trials, the EC took steps to correct it — to guard
against continued misuse of the public trial — in its
White Book Revisions hearings this week. Formerly,
eight of the 12 student jurors had to vote guilty for a
student to be convicted. Responding to a letter from a
faculty member that called that process ‘‘patently ab-
surd,’’ the EC passed a revision lowering the number
of student jurors to five who must vote guilty for the
student to be convicted.

Although we understand the frustration the EC
must feel at consistently having its convictions over-
turned by a student body jury, we feel this move was a
step too far in the other direction. Under the proposed
change, a majority of student jurors could vote inno-
cent, and the student would he found guilty.

There are other ways of altering fhe public honor
trial proceedings so as to make appeals less attrac-
tive. Lowering the number of votes needed to convict
to less than a majority of the jurors is not a sensible
solution. Above all, our honor system should be fair to
both student and EC.

If this proposal receives final approval next week, it
would not be so.

Mommy, we’re big boys now

To the Editors:

I never try to get involved in
anything I don’t know about, but
after looking at the asinine Rush
proposal, I must protest. Being a
freshman and just recently hav-
ing gone through Rush, I laugh-
ed scornfully at the proposal
passed by the out-of-touch UC. I
didn’t know I was a student at
Washington and Lee High
School; someone told me it was
college.

The administration’s infringe-
ments upon my private life can
no longer be tolerated. I quote
the proposal: ‘The Student Af-
fairs Committee agrees that the
nature of Rush should be chang-
ed to put less emphasis on
amplified music (get a load of
that term) and alcoholic
beverages (let’s protect those
freshmen; they’ve probably
never had beer) and should be
shortened to lessen the distrac-
tion from the academic charac-
ter of life at W&L in the opening
weeks of fall term.”’

Oh yes, I agree with the ad-
ministration; I think we should
tell the freshmen that frater-
nities are really just study
groups and keep all real views of
fraternities from their naive
eyes. Concerning the shortened
Rush, I also agree. We should
hurry up their decision. After
all, they’re only making a deci-
sion which will affect the next
four years of their lives. Turning
in homework that first week is
by far more important (if we
make the assumption at all that
during Rush a freshman would
not do his required work). Fur-
thermore, the proposal makes
Rush dry, except for two beer
parties on only two nights — dry
of girls and beer. Only on these
two nights are bands permitted,
however, one of these nights
happens to fall the night after
bids are to be accepted (a fast
one on the SAC’s part). To go on,
Rush orientation and registra-
tion is scheduled for the first day
of Rush. How are the poor, inno-

cent freshmen to decide which
houses to sign up for if they
haven’t had a good week to
select several houses to return
to?

The Rush proposal is just the
tip of the iceberg as far as the
“Mommy” administration is go-
ing to restrict our social lives.
Next year, “Tuesday Nights in
the Pit” are no more; they’ve
been moved to Wednesday night
(I wonder which fraternal
engagements are the target of
this slick move — yes, Wednes-
day night parties! If and when
Wednesday night parties occur,
they are to be limited to “frater-
nity members only”’ and are also
to be “‘chip-in” parties).

Oh yes, let’s not forget about
restrictions on fraternity parties

in general. ‘‘Mommy’’ had
decided for us that fraternities
are to only be allowed four
weekend parties per semester.
Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?

It is absolutely ludicrous for
this maternal administration to
be making such drastic changes
in the social life at W&L. I am
here to make my own decisions
such as whether I will drink on a
school night or whether I will do
my schoolwork. It is none of the
administration’s business to in-
terfere with my private life, or
that of any other student’s at this
school. It is for this reason that I
chastize the moves being made
against the social life at W&L by
the administration.

Student is shocked

by White

To the Editors:

I was shocked after reading
the article in the May 3 Phi
describing Dean John White’s
behavior at last week’s ‘‘pre-
trial conference.” Pulling a per-
son out of a chair by the ankles is
indicative of a second-grade stu-
dent, but a second-year law stu-
dent? Please. The ability to
react rationally in a ‘‘heated
discussion” would seem essen-
tial for an aspiring lawyer. I do
not feel that death threats reflect
rational behavior. Mr. White
continued to dine on his own foot
as he branded the President of
our Student Body and captain of
our football team a “‘crybaby”
who “‘needed something to com-
plain about.”” Why should Mr.
Jenevein need to complain? The
EC’s decision was _ upheld!
Assuming that Mr. White is still
intent on pursuing a career in
law, I suggest that he review the
basic elements of common

’s actions

courtesy before entering a court-

room. After all, contempt there

may result in more serious con-
sequences.

Low Ball turnout
leads to SABU loss

By JOHN WINTERS
Special to the Phi

After planning for a crowd of
over 1,100 and spending more
than $10,000 preparing for the
13th Annual SABU Ball, the W&L
Student Association for Black
Unity was stung financially
Saturday night when only about
300 people attended.

SABU officials are blaming
the timing of the ball for the poor
attendance. The loss has been
estimated to be between $5,000
and $8,000.

Ron Magee, past president of
SABU, felt the main problem
was student apathy, especially
in regard to the conflict with the
Spring Weekend. “I got a few
remarks that because of the con-
flict with Spring Weekend, peo-
ple were upset and not coming,”
he remarked.

Magee stated that SABU had
‘“‘made an honest attempt to pro-
vide a good time for the W&L
community and to make it more
accessible to everyone.’’ Yet it
turns out that by trying to give
everyone a chance to par-
ticipate, SABU was financially
hurt. One of the main reasons for
moving the ball to the spring
term was so that students would
not have to shell out more money
so soon after Fancy Dress,
Magee said. The usual date for
the ball is in late March.

Attendance for the ball was
approximately 200 fewer than
usual, according to Magee. The
reason for this was in the late
date, he said. Many people from
surrounding schools in Roanoke,
Lynchburg and the area
women’s colleges attend. Yet
due to the late date, Magee said
many of the schools were either
in exams or, as in the case of
James Madison University, out
of school.

The lower attendance had a
profound effect upon the finan-
cial status of SABU. D Train
alone cost $7,000 while Lite Year
added another $700, according to
Dean of Minority affairs John L.
White. Added to this were the
costs for food, security, and ren-
tal tables. Cleanup and the set-
ting up and break down of the
band’s equipment were all done
by the students themselves,
White said.

SABU was alloted $1,500 by the
EC in September, and Magee
said that the EC refused in April

to grant SABU additional funds.

White said, ‘‘We didn’t lose any

Red Front

money, but we didn’t have
enough to give a substantial gift
to the Poindexter Fund.” This
fund is in memory of Marjorie
Poindexter, a secretary for over
15 years here who recently died
while at work. She handled the
affairs for the minority students
before a dean was selected to
handle it. The fund -is an
emergency loan for students
with urgent need.

When questioned further about
where the additional funds to
pay for all the expenses came
from, Dean White responded,
“‘Jet’s just say that all the bills
were paid,’’ he said. Magee was
more open and admitted that
they had to use funds from the
SABU budget. He added that, ‘‘I
do not believe that we are in the
black, we took a beating and it
will have repercussions on our
future activities.”

Overall both men felt that
despite the poor turnout, every-
one there had an excellent time.
Magee felt that ‘‘on May 5,
SABU put on the best show found
anywhere in the area.’ White
furthered that line by stating:
“The bottom line is that it was
an outstanding show and I wish
more people could have seen it,
but it didn’t slow down D Train
or the people there.”

By MARKHAM S. PYLE
Phi Columnist

Tomorrow night, there will be
considerable debate on the plat-
form of the Mock Democratic
Convention. The platform, this
time around, really does reflect
as best it might the views com-
mon to the National Democratic
Party. Tuesday, President

My View

Reagan spoke to the Council of
the Americas on Central
American Affairs. On Saturday
— Cinco de Mayo — there were
the Democratic caucuses in Tex-
as.

All of these have a common
note. They have a lot to do with
some modern confusions. The
confusion between freedom and
democracy. The confusion be-
tween hierarchy and tyranny.
The confusion, most of all, be-
tween liberty and license.

The president has little choice
but to employ the most common
terms of political discourse. He
could hardly do otherwise than
accept the present situation in
which freedom, secured to the

 

United States by their careful

“Opinion

Clearing up the confusion

avoidance of untrammelled
democracy, by their commit-
ment to republican constitu-
tionalism, is actually spoken of
as something dependent on
democratic voting procedure.
But the persistence of this confu-
sion can only debase_ the
language and tangle thought.

Certainly, my own party, the
Democratic party, has, on the
national level, fallen prey to this
confusion. As reflected in our
own Mock Convention platform,
the prevailing attitudes of the
elite which has captured and
which controls the national par-
ty are best characterized as
“‘unidea’d leftism.’”’ By some
curious alchemy, a commitment
to The People has become
transmuted to a program of
legislation directed toward
nothing so much as the reduction
of popular liberty: the expansion
of the state, in the people’s name
at the people’s expense.

The Texas Democratic Party
does things differently.We are
committed to the caucus system.
Those who feel that freedom on-
ly exists in democracy will ob-
ject that the caucus is inferior to
the primary, that it is a vile

_mechanism for the stifling of the

popular will.
In fact, the caucus structure
back home is anything but an

oligarchic despotism. Party
members who vote in the pri-
mary for local and statewide of;
fices are credentialled to their
precinct caucuses. The caucus
endorsement is based on ‘the
sense of the meeting.’

Now this, it seems to me, is a
vindication of the principle of
‘natural aristocracy.’ Before I
am drawn and quartered, let me
explain. That tart, prim
Calvinist John Adams best defin-
ed ‘natural aristocracy’ in a let-
ter ta Josiah Quincy—the
natural aristocrat is that man
who can control two votes: his
own and another’s. His principle
of hierarchy is natural to men,
and politicians ignore it at their
peril. Indeed, it is proper that
this principle be obeyed. It is the
process of ensuring that those
who are interested in a political
question are made aware of
their interest, the process
whereby the natural aristocrat
convinces his constituency of the
validity of his opinions, which
serves as a check upon the
tyranny of a majority opinion. It
forces deep consideration of
issues and public debate upon
them, and it preserves liberty
and diversity. Let us who are
concerned with liberty and

 

diversity preserve it.

 

Contact budgets to be cut in future

Speaker committee funding reduced in effort to fill $6,000 deficit.

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Three thousand dollars will be
deducted from Contact’s budget
in both 1984-85 and 1985-86 to help
eliminate a deficit of $6,000 that
had built up over a period of
several years.

The deficit cutting measure
was approved 9-1 by the Ex-
ecutive Committee last week.-

Contact, an ~ organization
designed to bring speakers to
campus, is funded by student
taxes, individual contributions
and a contribution from the In-
terfraternity Council.

The deficit was not discovered
until March, when Contact co-
chairmen Marty Harmon and
Gov Slahor found out that the
organization has a deficit of
$15,000 accumulated in previous
years. The deficit went unnotic-

 

 

Rent A Kegtainer

  
   

ed because Contact’s records
showed the group had a $950
surplus in 1982-83, while Univer-
sity records showed the group
had a $10,000 deficit. In addition,
Contact had begun the 1982-1983
year with a deficit of nearly
$6,000, putting the total deficit at
$15,000 at the start of this year.

It was originally estimated
that $13,500 in additional funds
would be needed to eliminate
Contact’s deficit. A preliminary
proposal had called for $5,200 to
be cut from Contact’s budget in
1984-85 and $5,400 in 1985-86 as
part of a plan to retire the
deficit.

Junior EC representative Cole
Dawson said Contact’s deficit
actually was only $6,000. Dawson
reported that a $7,500 con-
tribution by the IFC to Contact in
April had not been figured into
the estimate of the deficit.

Dawson said that it was confu-
sion over an IFC contribution
last year that caused the deficit.
Last year the IFC made two
$7,500 contributions — one in
September and one in April —
because it had forgotten to pay
Contact the previous year. The
September contribution was
meant to be credited to Contact
‘*82,’’ explained Dawson.

Dawson said last year’s Con-
tact assumed that both contribu-
tions by the IFC were to be

credited to them. Consequently,
Contact spent more than $25,000
last year when actually they on-
ly had about $15,000 to spend,
Dawson said.

Slahor said he was satisfied
with the EC’s final plan.

“‘We had made a preliminary
arrangement. At the time the
cost to next year’s Contact was
much greater. The way it’s turn-
ed out, it’s much more scaled
down than originally,’ Slahor
added.

Slahor said he thought the ar-
rangement was fair to everyone.
He said he hoped next year’s
Contact would be able to work its
way around the $3,000 cut.

“It’s not going to hurt the pro-
gram too much. The program’s
back on course. Two years from
now it will be solvent,” Slahor
said.

Slahor said that one way next
year’s Contact could get around
the $3,000 deficit was by launch-
ing an extensive fund raising
drive aimed at parents and
alumni. Sponsoring one fewer
speaker or less-expensive
speakers are also possible solu-
tions to the problem, Slahor said.

“T think that it’s very possible
that with an active drive to the
parents and alumni it could be
made up,” Slahor said.

Contact could also split the
cost of a speaker with another

organization such as the Law
Forum, Slahor said. This year
Contact co-sponsored a speech
by Hugh Sidey with the Mock
Convention, Slahor pointed out.

Slahor said that most speakers
considered by Contact charged
between $2,000 and $8,000. Con-
tact’s most expensive speaker
this year was Malcolm Forbes,
who charged $8,000 including
travel fees.

Although Contact is in debt
from past years, Slahor said this
year’s Contact did not add to the
deficit.

‘We stayed within the budget.
We’re not in debt for our year,”’
he said.

A final budget report will be
submitted to the EC as soon as
possible, Slahor said. Contact
was supposed to report to the EC
Monday night, but did not. The

EC reprimanded Contact for its _

failure to report on time.

Slahor said Contact found out
about the deficit too late in the
year to cut back on this year’s
program in order to start reduc-
ing the deficit.

‘“‘When we found out about it,
we already owed money for
Hugh Sidey and Seymour
Hersh. And we were under con-
tract to Malcolm Forbes. We
paid off our debt of $5,000 and the
rest went to Forbes,’’ Slahor re-
ported.

UC passes dry, two-week Rush

dry, two-week Rush calendar for
September of the next school
year,

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent David Perdue presented the
two-week calendar as a proposal
to the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, which passed it without ob-
jection and sent it to the UC,

which passed the proposal by a
10-6 vote.

The calendar is a compromise
of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Fraternity Affairs’ recommen-
dation of a one-week Rush and a
previous IFC proposal of a three-
week Rush that was rejected by
the SAC.

Next year’s Rush will begin
with Rush Orientation and
Registration on Tuesday, May 4,

tation begins.

Eight Open Houses are
scheduled for the first two days.
The first four Rush Dates will
take place Thursday and Friday
of that first week, with no bids to
be offered until the second week.

No contact will be allowed
after any Rush function during
the first week, including after
the fourth Rush Date Friday
night. Also, all Rush functions
are dry and limited to members
and freshmen only.

Alcohol can be served for the

_ first time Saturday night of the

first week, when one-band par-
ties are allowed.

The only functions scheduled
for Tuesday and Thursday of the
second week, the first week of
classes, are optional dinners at

the fraternity houses, with no
contact after 7 p.m.

Rush Dates five through eight
are scheduled for Monday and
Wednesday of the second week,
with bids being offered but no
contact allowed after 10 p.m.

Friday, September 14, will in-
clude dormitory Rush from 3-5
p.m. and Rush Dates nine and
10, after which Rush is officially
over, bids may be accepted, and
non-band parties are allowed.

One band parties are permit-
ted that Saturday night.
Preference cards are due Sep-
tember 17.

“IT think it will be short and
very intense,’’ Perdue said, ‘‘but
that’s what they want it to do as
far as getting the freshmen into
the academic aspect of school

earlier than the old Rush did.”

Dean of Students Lewis John,
a member of the SAC and UC,
said that by moving the start of
Rush back it did not impinge on
classes as much but still remain-
ed long enough to satisfy
everyone.

“There was some sentiment
expressed that the calendar was
too short,’’ John said of the UC
meeting.

Perdue said there was a dif-
ferent dissenting opinion in the
SAC meeting.

‘“‘A couple of them wanted to
see a little change (in the pro-
posal) but saw that we could use
this as a transition year, and
may'e we could cut it down even
further next year if we see the
need for it,’’ Perdue said.

Dederick to receive degree

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

A Washington and Lee student
convicted last fall on three drug-
related charges can receive his
diploma May 31, the faculty
decided Monday.

William Loren Dederick, who
was given a 12-year suspended
sentence and 10 years probation
for the sale of cocaine, posses-
sion of cocaine, and posession of
marijuana with intent to
manufacture, was suspended
from the university for this
academic year by the Student
Affairs Committee in October.

Dederick had completed his

requirements for graduation
when he was arrested a few days
before the commencement
ceremonies last May.

Sources within the faculty in-
dicated the vote was close Mon-
day.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John, in a background letter to
faculty members, wrote, “‘Disci-
plinary cases are treated in-
dividually, and there is no
general university policy gov-
erning the disposition of student
cases which involve felony con-
victions.”’

Thomas Rohrig, another
Washington and Lee student con-
victed at the same time as

Dederick, was suspended for
three academic years. “In
Rorhig’s case, there was
evidence of numerous sales of
marijuana; for profit, over a
considerable period of time,”
John wrote.

While serving 90 days in jail
and awaiting completion of a
pre-sentence report last fall,
Dederick conducted research
and performed some r-
cheological work under the
supervision of W&L anthro-
pology Professor John
McDaniel.

A work-release program such.
as this must be approved by the
Rockbridge County Sheriff S.M.
Reynolds and Circuit Court
Judge George E. Honts III.
Honts gave his approval to the
plan Nov. 14.

Guidelines issued by the
sheriff’s office for work-release
programs read, ‘‘In order to
qualify, the inmate must first be
approved by the sheriff and the
court.”

“No drug related . . . inmates
will be considered for this pro-
gram.”

Reynolds said yesterday that
because Dederick was doing
work for the community and was
not earning any money, he did
not technically fall under those
guidelines. ‘“The judge let this go
because he was trying to rehabil-
itate these people,’’ Reynolds
added.

Honts said that when the
sheriff approves a work-release
program, he usually concurs.
“My position on work-release
from jails has been that so long
as the sheriff establishes
reasonable guidelines to ad-
minister the program, I'll go
along with his administrative
policies,’’ Honts said.

‘nis particular work-release
program was a little bit unusual,
Honts said, because Dederick
was supervised by both
McDaniel and by his attorney,
Thomas Spencer.

on the weekly public television
program Washington Week in
Review.

McDowell is a_ Lexington
native. He joined the staff of the
Times-Dispatch in 1949, after
earning the M.S. degree from
Columbia University’s graduate
school of journalism.

He became a regular colum-

nist for the Times-Dispatch in
1955 and Washington correspon-
dent for the paper in 1965. He has
covered each national political
convention since 1952.

W&L awarded McDowell an
honorary degree in 1975.

Reunion activities have been
planned for 11 W&L classes, in-
cluding the 50th reunion for the
Class of 1934.

Ethics program granted $75,000

Washington and Lee has
received a $75,000 grant from the
Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tions of Jacksonville, Fla., to
assist in establishing an $800,000
endowment for the University’s
program in applied ethics,
“Society and the Professions.’

The $75,000 from the Davis
Foundations will complete a
challenge grant from the Na-

tional Endowment for the
Humanities. With the addition of
the Davis Foundations grant,
Washington and Lee has raised
$600,000 to meet the NEH
challenge and thereby qualify
for $200,000 from the NEH.

“With this generous gift, the
Arthur Vining Davis Founda-
tions have enabled us to meet
our challenge and to establish a

permanent endowment for one
of the most distinctive teaching
programs at Washington and
Lee,’’ W&L President John D.
Wilson said.

The Davis Foundations make
gifts in support of private higher
education, hospice, medicine,
theological seminaries and na-
tional public television pro-
grams.

Wilson said the Campus Life
and the Academic Affairs sub-
committees seemed to be carry-
ing. the largest burdens. The
Campus Life committee, which
was created earlier this year, is
examining the potential effects
of coeducation on the athletic
program, the fraternity system,
the University residential life
and the University food services.

The Academic Affairs com-
mittee is examining the effects
on the “admissions office and
the quality of the applicant pool”’
as well as potential shifts in the
size of the undergraduate
academic departments, Wilson
said.

The Executive Committee,
which is made up of the subcom-
mittee chairmen, is studying the
‘‘intangibles”’ of the issue which
Wilson said include such sub-
jects as honor and tradition.

“The Executive Committee is
trying to figure out what the am-
bience of W&L is,” Wilson said.
‘That’s a different set of con-
siderations but a very important
set,’’

The Planning and Develop-
ment committee is handling the
questionnaire, Wilson said, and
is also trying to estimate the ef-
fect of coeducation on alumni
donations to the University.

Frank’s King of Pizza
passes the Beat’s inspection

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

If you like your pizza authen-
tic, and by that I mean made by
real Italians, then Frank’s King
of Pizza is the place for you — to
buy pizza. But while the pizza is
good, I recommend Frank’s for
other reasons, namely the sand-

The

Eat Beat

wiches, the calzones and the
very reasonable prices.

Frank’s has two kinds of piz-
za: the regular pizza, with the
regular crust, and the much
thicker-crusted Sicilian pizza. I
prefer the regular crust,
because I would rather fill
precious space with as high a
cheese-pepperoni-sausage-and-
tomato-sauce-to-bread ratio as
possible, but this is strictly a
matter of personal preference.
For those who like thicker crust,
Frank’s Sicilian pizza should
surely please. Despite its
thickness, it does have a crunchy
bottom, as well as a generous
supply of toppings.

The crust on the regular pizzas
is closer to the chewy of
Domino’s than to the crispiness
of Pizza Hut. As for ingredients,

Frank’s puts much more on than
the sparsely decorated Domi-
no’s, and more than Pizza Hut as
well. If I have one specific
“beef”’ with Frank’s, it’s that
their sausage comes in strips
rather than chunks, and I missed
the texture of chunks. In an
overall comparison, I would rate
Frank’s Pizza in the middle of

the two magnates, behind Pizza .

Hut and ahead of Domino’s. Yet
it is for sandwiches and
calzones, and not pizza, that I go
to Frank’s.

Frank’s sandwiches range
from $2 to $2.25 and constitute
one of the real bargains in Lex-
ington fast food. It wouldn’t be
telling to compare their sand-
wiches to say, Spanky’s, because
Frank’s sandwiches are so
distinctly Frank’s, and don’t fit
in the Spanky’s deli category.
Where Spanky’s sandwiches are
soft and melty, Frank’s are
crunchy and juicy, and are an
entirely different kind of sand-
wich.

Frank’s makes their sand-
wiches by grilling the ingre-
dients together, lightly grilling
the open bun, putting the grilled
ingredients in the bun and then
folding it. This makes for a sand-
wich with a spontaneous, throw-
it-in appearance rather than the
neatly manicured layer look. My
favorite is easily the steak and

cheese (without onions, though
you have the choice), with
mustard, mayo and lettuce. The
steak strips and cheese are grill-
ed until they become, essential-
ly, as one. It’s very hot, with a
crunchy bun, and dripping juice,
as opposed to grease (an impor-
tant distinction).

Also delicious is the ham and
cheese, which is the only other
one I’ve tried. Chow hound Hall
of Famer Bubba Schaffer had
nothing but good to say about the
meatball sandwich and the
sausage and cheese, so further
experimentation is likely.

A review of Frank’s would not
be complete without mention of
the calzones. I had never heard
of a calzone before coming to
W&L, and it’s difficult to
describe them to those who re-
main uninitiated. They’re like
contained pizzas without tomato
sauce, like a huge breaded
pocket filled with cheese and
ham. Calzones have what must
bea block of mozzerella in them,
and after most bites you’ll have
to stop the cheese stretch with
your fingers. Though the regular
calzone comes with ham, you
can treat it like a pizza in that
you can add whatever ingre-
dients you like.

Next week, the Eat Beat has a
square meal and a cold Bud. And
plays a little pool.

When the chances are one in a
hundred for a play to make it on
Broadway, a playwright such as
Washington and Lee professor
Thomas J. Ziegler knows the
odds are stacked against him.
Despite the ever-increasing
possibility that Ziegler will beat
the odds with his current ‘‘off-
off-Broadway production,’’ the
road to Broadway success still
appears long and arduous.

According to Ziegler, an
associate professor of drama,
there are two basic routes a
playwright can take. ‘The
popular route today is to send
the script to a regional theatre.
The play is tried out there first.”

“The old fashioned way,’’ the
Illinois native said, ‘‘was to
simply send your script toa New
York producer...” This method
has become too expensive, as it
now costs at least a million
dollars to produce a Broadway
show.

This is the path Ziegler took in
marketing his most acclaimed
work to date, “‘The Ninth Step.”’

“There are three stages of
New York productions,” Ziegler
said. The pinnacle, of course, is
Broadway, but with so few
theatres, a play must establish
some credentials first. These are
gained through ‘‘off-Broadway”’
and ‘‘off-off-Broadway’”’
theatres.

Approximately 1,000 ‘‘off-off-
Broadway’’ theatres exist.
These are largely non-profit
theatres that either specialize or
serve as vehicles for potential
Broadway plays. The 150 ‘‘off-
Broadway”’ theatres are all
commercial theatres and may

W&L drama profe
serve as the next stop before the
bright lights of Broadway.

Ziegler’s ‘“‘The Ninth Step’
received strong reviews at an
“off-off-Broadway” theatre in
New York, the Riverwest earlier
this year. The play tells
the story of an alcoholic who has
stopped drinking and is trying to
re-establish a relationship with -
her daughter. The ninth of

Weary conventioneers and
alumni should save a little
energy for Sunday afternoon.
The Student Activities Board
and the Interfraternity Council
will present Clarence Clemons
and the Red Bank Rockers. You
might remember Clemons as the
‘‘big man” with the sax pictured
next to Bruce Springsteen on the
cover of Springsteen’s album
“Born to Run.” This distinctive
sax is an integral part of the E
Street Band. ‘“‘When you hear
my saxophone,’’ Clemon says
candidly, ‘‘you know it’s me, it’s
not just anybody’s thing, it
makes you stop and say, ‘Hey,
that’s the Big Man!’ ”’

Clemons was born in Norfolk,
Va., and raised in a devoutly
religious Baptist family. His ear-
ly musical experiences came
from singing in the church choir
and taking sax lessons at Nor-
folk State College. Later
Clemons attended Maryland
State College on a football and
music scholarship. During his
sophomore year, Clemons
discovered the ‘‘beach music”’ of
Chesapeake Bay. He joined a

group called The Vibratones,
whose lead singer was John
Bowen. After college, Clemons
moved to Philadelphia, where he
played semi-pro football for the
Newark Bears. He was also a
member of the original Jersey
Generals. At night, Clemons
moonlighted his way through
small bands which would later
pay off in an unexpected way.
The lead singer of a band called
Joyful Noise’ introduced
Clemons to Bruce Springsteen.
They immediately became
friends and Clemons appeared
on the next Springsteen album.

It was during these early days
that Clemons earned his nick-

name “Big Man.” The group had |

become known for upstaging
their main acts, so managers
constantly warned them.
Clemon relates, ‘‘They would
say, ‘if you’re not off the stage in
20 minutes, we’re pulling the
plug!’ and I’d say ‘if you pull the
plug, I’ll kick your tail all over
this auditorium!’ ”’

Yet, even after Springsteen
and the E Street Band earned
their fame, Clemons always
dreamed of forming his own
band. So, in 1981, he opened Big
Man West in Red Bank, N.J. The

he Big Man G Company |

Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers play Wilson Field

nightclub gave him a chance to
explore his musical direction
and gave young talent a chance
at the spotlight. Clemons
assembled a house band, the
Red Bank Rockers, from crack
studio musicians and his friend
John Bowen. Clemons describes
Bowen as a classic soul shouter,
reminiscent of Wilson Pickett.

Clemons’ next step toward
fulfilling his dream was to
record an album. ‘‘Rescue” was
the result. The album relies on a
few chords (Resurrection Shuf-
fle’), as well as originals penned
by Clemons. The album also
features ‘‘Savin’ Up,’’ an
original Springsteen composi-
tion. Record magazine des-
cribes the music as ‘‘fat, frolic-
some R&B band sounds of the
’60s. Rescue conjures up mental
pictures of a recording studio
crammed to the monitors with
players, friends, and hangers-on
shouting out choruses between
sipping brews.’’ Another review
States ‘It’s a record for rolling
back the chairs and having a
good time.’’ If the record is any
indication of what the band is
capable of, Sunday afternoon
should provide one heck of a par-
ty.

Tom Ziegler
\leoholics Anonymous’ 12 steps
s to patch things up with friends
ind relatives. Said Ziegler,
‘Most alcoholics feel the ninth
tep is the most difficult of all.
t's very difficult...to patch
hings up.”

The play was written and
pened at W&L in 1980. Ziegler
wen circulated his script around
lew York, and actor/producer

Roderick Cook bought the rights
to the play. “It’s called an ‘op-
tion.’ They buy the rights to pro-
duce that show...for one year,”
Ziegler explained.

The general manager, the
man who ‘“‘makes or breaks’”’ the
show, according to Ziegler, is
now being hired. ‘‘Then they’ll
cast the play. Then the show will
go out of town,”’ he says. Out of
town theatres are those ‘‘off-
Broadway’’ theatres located in
the cities of Philadelphia,
Washington and New Haven.

Although it is easier for a well-
known playwright to get a piece
onto Broadway, even the best
may receive poor reviews and
see their plays quickly with-
drawn. In the case of a revival,
“if they get a powerful enough
cast, that show can open direct-
ly,” says Ziegler.

It is the producer’s job to raise

‘ money from investors, accord-

ing to Ziegler. ‘‘A person almost
needs to be a tax lawyer to start
in this,” he says, and notes that
most investors plan on losing
money. Shows have been known
to close despite good reviews for
the sole purpose of giving the in-
vestors a tax break.

Having received good reviews
from critics and plenty of local
media coverage, Ziegler is now
working on a musical and look-
ing for a composer.

“I’ve pretty much finished the
book of a musical. It’s what New
York is buying right now,”
Ziegler said.

Having joined the faculty in
1976, Ziegler’s main background
is in theatre and light design. He
had done work in Chicago,
Toledo, Ohio, and the Virgin
Islands before coming to W&L.

Seniors display art

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

The duPont Gallery will host
n exhibition of the works of six
Vashington and Lee senior
tudio art majors May 9-31.

The six students — Lewis
Jlen, Steve Brooks, Peter
‘ronin, Lee Heimert, Doug
vuhn and Ross Lynde — have
een exposed to numerous ar-
istic trends while attending
V&L, and it is not surprising
hat the 32 pieces in the show
epresent at least six different
1ediums and as many styles.

Lewis Allen is presenting
ree paintings in acrylic and
halk on canvas. He chose these
jaterials primarily because of
is familiarity with their proper-
ies and the contrast in texture
hey provide. He has been in-
tuenced most profoundly by
alvador Dali and surrealism.

Steve Brooks is showing sever
‘aintings in mixed media. He
eels that collage and footage
re the medias of the 20th cen-
ury, and through them he can
nost easily capture the origin of

particular image. His work is
oncerned with rubbings of com-
non materials arranged to sug-
est their significance to each

scene.
Peter Cronin is the only senior
exclusively presenting a series
of photographs. To him photog-
raphy represents a major move-
ment in art of the 20th century.
His abstractions of everyday
scenes show the influence of the
photographers Minor White and
Ralph Gibson. He plans to enter
a program in photography at
Ohio State University next fall.
Lee Heimert is showing a
series of paintings in acrylic on
canvas. For the past two years
he has been deeply influenced by
contemporary abstractionists.

Doug Kuhn will present four
pieces of sculpture in lead as his
thesis. His works begin as wax
molds because he feels wax is
easier to work with than clay. He
has been influenced by the work
of Degas and David Hockney.

Ross Lynde is exhibiting six
works of sculpture made of cop-
per pipe, iron and steel cable.
Following a style he developed
late last year, Ross’ work shows
the influence of the contem-
porary sculptor David Smith.

All six artists will be honored
at a reception in duPont Gallery
on Wednesday, May 30, from 3-5

Much to the dismay of this

all their oily, nude glory in at-

I realize that I risk certain
chastisment for taking such a
hard line on Hardbodies but I
feel obligated to rail with all my
might on this, the fourth mind-
less beach, breasts and buns ex-
travaganza of the term.

Actually, Hardbodies has a
script that reads like Terms of
Endearment compared to its re-
cent cohorts Where The Boys
Are 84 and Up The Creek, but to
mention Terms and Hardbodies
in the same line borders on the
sacreligious. Another positive
factor about this movie is that

Satire set

By BOB BRYANT
Entertainment Editor

Reagan Rex, a political satire
in the classic Greek style, will be
presented by the University
Theatre on Friday as part of the
festivities for the Mock Conven-
tion. The play will be performed
at 4 and 6 p.m. on a parade float
in front of the W&L student
center.

W&L Drama Professor Albert
C. Gordon wrote the play with
the help of his spring term Total
Theatre class, a class in which
students take an active role in
every stage of a theatrical pro-
duction. ‘‘The play has been an
interesting project,’’ said Gor-
don, who began soliciting ideas
for the script last fall but was
forced to rewrite the script
repeatedly as the plot and

shudder to think what our stoic
rivals would say upon viewing
this masterpiece of American
cinema. (‘‘The fall of the United
States is imminent! Ha ha ha!’’)
So, my advice to the W&L
moviegoer is basically the same
as last week. Go see Hardbodies,
but only if you can’t do

“The idea was to create the
sort of political satire that
Aristophanes would have done in

decision to perform the play as
street theatre came later,” Gor-

Gordon’s strategy is to park
the float near the student center
and perform the play in the
street between sessions of the
Mock Convention, in the manner
that traveling medicine acts and

for years. ‘‘We hope to have

House Corporation, who travel-
ed to Lexington two weekends
ago from as far away as Dallas,
met with a local architect and
made contact with several con-
tractors, according to Sessoms.

“Their hope is to rebuild by
the fall of 1985,"’ he said. ‘‘That’s
not impossible, but it’s certainly
ambitious.”

‘Their general thought at this
early, early stage is to see if they
can rebuild the house with a
slightly different plan,” he said.
“They'll retain the first-floor
plan, but will possibly consider
redoing the second and third
floors to accommodate more
people.”

The existing house, the
limestone walls of which remain
standing, held 18 people, and the
new structure may be designed
to house 24 people. The fraterni-
ty has just under 35 members.

It is uncertain whether the
present structure will have to be
razed or if it can be retained.

While the alumni board was in
town, it met with University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
Associate Dean of Students Dan
N. Murphy and several private
insurance adjusters.

At the suggestion of Sessoms,
the board also toured the Sigma
Nu and Kappa Alpha fraternity
houses, both of which have
recently undergone extensive
renovation.

Insurance claims have not yet
been settled, preventing the
alumni board from making
definite arrangements for
reconstruction, Sessoms said.
“Since a death was involved, the
fire investigation is proceeding
very painstakingly,’ he said
yesterday.

“Until they know what they
have to work with, it’s hard to
make plans,” he continued.

“If the official report on the
fire is filed soon, and there’s
nothing in it that causes any fur-
ther delay, we hope to settle the
insurance matters quickly.”

The contents of the house were
insured for $66,000, and the
structure was covered for as
much as $385,000. Some of the
contents of the house, including
some personal possessions and
kitchen equipment, have been
salvaged.

Shortly after the fire, the inter-
national headquarters of Phi
Gamma Delta sent a letter ex-
plaining the situation to all
alumni of the fraternity from
Washington and Lee and schools
within a 60 mile radius of Lex-
ington.

The letter said that ‘‘an early
report would indicate the fire
was caused somehow by a fire-
place.”

Religious leader Norman Vin-
cent Peale, a member of the
fraternity, sent the chapter a let-
ter expressing his ‘‘sorrow over
the death of our beloved and
talented brother, Thomas J.
Fellin.”

“The loss of your chapter
house by fire represent an
adversity to overcome by the
thought that something even bet-
ter can result,’’ he said in the let-
ter. ‘‘A finer house will rise of
which all Fiji’s can be proud.

“Phi Gamma are never de-
feated by a problem, however
difficult. The positive spirit is
built into our inheritance.’’

‘Nine’ claims best ODAC tourney finish ever

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team completed its
most successful season in 12
years in an appropriate manner
last weekend by finishing second
in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament in
Lynchburg.

The Generals knocked off
regular-season conference
champion Randolph-Macon, 9-7,
in the semifinals before falling to
Lynchburg, 4-1, in the finals.

W&L finished the season with
a record of 11-12 (7-4 in the se-
cond half of the season), giving
the team the most victories of
any General team since 1972.
The second-place finish in the
tournament was the best ever
for the Generals.

‘In the semifinal game, the
Generals spotted Randolph-
Macon a big lead in the first in-
ning. W&L starting pitcher Kirk
Breen was relieved in the first
inning by Randy Brown after
giving up five runs, four of which
were unearned, on three walks
anda bases-loaded triple.

W&L got on the scoreboard in
the fourth inning after Hugh
Finkelstein and Milam Turner
both singled. Dave Warrenfeltz’s
sacrifice fly scored Finkelstein
from third base, cutting the
Yellow Jackets’ lead to 5-1.

The score remained unchang-
ed until the seventh inning, when
designated hitter Bill Curtiss led
off with a single and Mike
Jacoby reached base on an er-
ror. Curtiss scored after con-
secutive singles by Finkelstein
and Bill White. Pinch runner

Eric Campbell scored on a pass-
ed ball, cutting the lead to 5-3.
Turner followed with a triple to
right field, scoring White and
Finkelstein and tying the score
at 5-5. Warrenfeltz put W&L
ahead for the first time when he
singled, scoring Turner.

In the bottom of the seventh in-
ning, the Yellow Jackets regain-
ed the lead by scoring two runs
after there were two outs. Brown
gave up a double, a run-scoring
single and a walk before being
relieved by bullpen ace Peter
Detlefs. Detlefs walked the first
two batters he faced, scoring one
of the runners and giving Ran-
dolph-Macon a 7-6 lead, before

getting the third out.

W&L trailed 7-46 entering the
ninth inning before rallying for
the win. Mike Walsh led off with
a walk and Kevin Golden follow-
ed with a single. With one out,
Curtiss grounded to the pitcher
for a possible game-ending dou-
ble play, but the throw to second
base sailed into center field,
allowing the runner to score
from second. Jacoby singled to
right, loading the bases, and
White delivered the crucial hit
—a single to right field that
scored two runs and put W&L
ahead to stay at 9-7.

Detlefs earned the win after
getting the final three outs in the

Loyola loss hands

lax worst record
since ’69 season

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team saw its regular
season draw to its poorest close
in 15 years Saturday with a 12-8
loss to Loyola on Wilson Field
that dropped the Generals’
season record to 5-9.

Against Loyola, the Generals’
downfall began, as it did
throughout the second half of the
season, late in the third quarter.
The Greyhounds’ Pat Lamon
notched three goals and used a
head dodge to set up another ina
five-goal outburst that broke a
4-4 deadlock.

Once they had established con-
trol, the Greyhounds held on to
the ball and used up the clock on
two separate occasions. Asked
why W&L did not put much

pressure on the ball when they
were behind, Daly said, ‘‘We
were taking the chance that
Loyola was going to make a
miscue.”’

Jeff Mason’s fifth goal of the
day and Lee Heimert’s low
bouncer from just inside the re-
taining line drew the Generals as
close as 10-7 with 3:26 left. But
another stall, which was com-
pleted by Lamon’s sixth goal,
took away the chance for a rally.
Chris John’s third solo rush of
the game created the final score.

No lacrosse team at W&L has
finished as many as four games
below .500 since the 1969 squad
went 1-8.

First-year coach Dennis Daly
discussed the year in which his
team lost four straight games,

ninth inning. Brown pitched 6 14
innings and allowed one earned
run.

‘Detlefs did one heck of a
job,” said W&L head coach Jim
Murdock. ‘‘Randy Brown also
did an excellent job in the middle
innings. We were patient at the
plate and eventually got to their
starting pitcher.”’

Finkelstein, Turner and White
each had three hits for the
Generals.

In the championship game
against Lynchburg under the
lights at City Stadium, a tired,
banged-up General team went
hitless through the first seven in-
nings as Lynchburg built a 40
lead.

The Hornets scored two runs
in the fourth inning against W&L
starter White on a double, a walk
and a single. Lynchburg added
two more runs in the fifth when
the lead-off batter reached base
after striking out when the ball
eluded catcher Jacoby. The next
batter tripled, scoring the lead
runner. The second run came
when a Lynchburg player scored
from third base on a passed ball.
White was relieved by Bill
Schoettelkotte in the fifth inning.

W&L scored its lone run in

the eighth inning, when Finkel-
stein singled, reached second
after Turner walked, and scored
after Walsh singled.

White, pitching on only two
days rest, after going 1014 inn-
ings against Eastern Mennonite,
took the loss for the Generals. He
ended the season with a 6-2
record and an_ earned-run-
average of 1.63, best in the con-
ference.

“The greatest satisfaction we
got as a team from this season
was that we had fun. It was en-
joyable for the kids to play
baseball,’’ Murdock said.

The Generals lose four seniors
from the 1984 squad, co-captains
Warrenfeltz and Walsh, Golden
and Campbell. Warrenfeltz,
Walsh and Golden, all four-year
Starters at W&L, comprised
three-fourths of the Generals’ in-
field.

“These are four super young
men,’’ Murdock said. ‘‘As I’ve
said all season, a good deal of
our success can be attributed to
our seniors. They’ve settled for
nothing short of excellence yet
weren’t concerned with _in-
dividual statistics. They were
concerned with winning ball
games.”

Blythe earns bid

Senior Bruce Blythe has been
selected to receive an at-large
berth in the NCAA Division III
Golf Championships to be held at
the State University. of
New York at Oswego on May
15-18.

Blythe served as co-captain of
the Generals and earned All-Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
honors this year.

‘IT am extremely pleased for
Bruce because he worked hard
on his game and really earned
the right to play in the NCAAs,”
W&L head golf coach Buck Les-

lie said. ‘I am also proud for the
team because his selection is a
reflection on the entire pro-
gram.”’

Blythe is the fourth W&L
player to receive the at-large
berth in the championships’ 10-
year history. W&L has twice
sent an entire team: 1977, when
the Generals finished seventh,
and in 1979 when they placed
ninth.

Blythe fired a combined 155 at
the Ingleside Country Club at the
ODAC Championships to lead
the Generals to a third-place
finish.

Downpour stymies
track NCAA attempt

Despite the fact that they ran
some of their fastest races of
their careers, three Washington
and Lee runners failed to qualify
for the NCAA National Cham-
pionships in a downpour at the
Maryland Invitational Sunday.

Angus McBryde ran his sec-
ond-fastest 1,500 meters in a
time of 3:56.0, but did not better
the NCAA qualifying time of
3:53.7. McBryde, a cross country
All-America, competed in the
NCAAs last year.

Mark Pembroke, who broke
the school record in the 800

meters with a time of 1:53.9, and
Paul Chapman, who covered the
distance in 1:54.8, also came up
short. The qualifying time for
the 800 meters is 1:52.3.

“The steady rain was a
definite factor and could have
been the difference in not quali-
fying,” said W&L track coach
Norris Aldridge.

Saturday, the three, plus shot
putter Tom Murray and triple
jumper Bill Rhinehart, will try
again at the Cavalier Classic in
Charlottesville.

Lacrosse: Should we stay or should we go?

MIKE STATCHURA
Sports Editor

..As the clock ticked down Saturday
afternoon at Wilson Field, the tired sort of
frustration that one feels after failing on
numerous attempts to complete a task
that-you-once-did-effortlessly seemed to
fully settle itself not only on the W&L
lacrosse players and coaches, but also on
the fans, who have perhaps come to expect
too much and now are bitter and
frustrated, too. The question of the NCAA
Division I status of W&L lacrosse is too
pressing right now to be avoided. Head
coach Dennis Daly said in an interview
just after he took over the reins, “As long
as we can remain competitive, I say ‘Why
not (continue to compete in Division I)?" "’
Daly also said that ‘‘competitive’’ was a
word that would have to be evaluated after
every year. His reasonable goal for stay-
ing competitive was to be in the running
for an NCAA tournament bid. Well, W&L is
not going to be one of those teams in the
running this year. Nor was it last year.
This is the first time in 15 years that there
have been back-to-back losing seasons.
(This is not an attack, just putting things in
perspective. )

We come back to the word ‘‘com-
petitive.’ Does ‘‘competitive’’ mean winn-
ing half of your contests against Division I
schools? Pushing a Division I squad to its
limit? Having some sort of chance at
beating all your Divison I foes? Or
something else? Reviewing the season,

‘there were games that W&L was very

capable of winning (against scholarship
schools), but did not (could not?). On the
negative side, when the Generals faced top
Division III schools they were more than
seriously challenged —they Were beaten

will be smashed. (We will be lowering
ourselves, I believe the sentiment would
be.) With the advent of the scholarship in
college lacrosse — and thus the increased
efforts of schools like Johns Hopkins,

In Division I, they are not on the same
level. I do not see this trend changing, and
this belief is solely based on the effects of
the scholarship. Even if a good lacrosse
player has the grades to be here, he
logically will still choose to go to the school
that will promise him a free education.
W&L can’t promise that. Thus, my sugges-
tion for W&L lacrosse is a choice.

We can choose to compete in Division
III, where we will maintain the cherished
student-athlete tradition and be a very
‘“‘competitive’’ team. Or there is another
route. We can start to give scholarships.
That’s right, with an important stipula-
tion: We must not allow educational stan-
dards to deteriorate. In this way, W&L
would remain attractive for the student-
athlete who is qualified educationally to be

times successful, but in the long run

to push W&L out of the competitiveness
range. Right now, and this can be of little

here, but cannot gather the bucks. ( Finan-
cial aid is important, but too often it does
not fully combat this situation.) W&L
needs to be a force in lacrosse again and it
can be, given the right thinking...

(This has not in any way been an indict-
ment of the coaches or especially the
athletes of the lacrosse program. On the
contrary, my respect for these exceptional

gentlemen will always be high. It is one
thing to face external pressure, but
another thing entirely when your unin-
formed peers are not satisfied with your
best efforts. My hat is tipped to you
gentlemen for time and again picking
yourself up off the ground and meeting the
adversary eyeball-to-eyeball, knowing full
well that he might be carrying a pistol to
your slingshot. )

.... Speaking of spitting adversity in the
eye, praises are to be extended to the
Smith Field (baseball) group and Coach
Jim Murdock, on their reaching the ODAC
finals before bowing out. Was quite im-
pressed with the way they turned them-
selves around. Just goes to prove the
adage that the cream always raises to the
top...

bably heard the Parkway Prognosticator

foretell Preakness winner next week....

....Finally, I'll give you more on this
Russian Olympic-pullout story, if it holds,
next week. In the meantime, let this suf-
fice: The boneheads who made this
brilliant decision in Moscow perhaps are
too far removed from understanding the
spirit of athletics — and in particular the
Olympic movement — to ever act with
common sense. I guess that explains their
decision....

This spring, aside from
lacrosse, baseball, track and the
other sports going on, a new
fetish has taken over in the
quads. Dormitory basketball,
featuring the best talents from
each hall under the leadership of
their dorm counselors has pitted
hall vs. hall in fight-to-the-finish
basketball.

Picture if you will Roland
Simon vs. Bob Tomaso, Tori
Richardson vs. Chris Cartmill,
Tim Schurr vs. Tom Schurr in
the battle of the brothers. The

 

goes on and on.

According to Roland Simon,
one of the dorm counselors, the
primary purpose of the games is
just to have fun. Under the direc-
tion of dorm counselor Tomaso,
games are scheduled during con-
venient hours such as after sup-
per on weekdays and on the
weekends.

Weather permitting, the inter-
dormitory games are played on
the outdoor courts, located be-
tween the tennis courts and the
baseball diamond at VMI. Be-
cause of scheduling conflicts,
games weren’t able to be

scheduled in the gym until
recently.)

“I think the main intention of
these games is to get guys who
don’t already know each other to
meet each other in a relaxed,
friendly atmosphere,” Simon
continued, ‘‘besides, they (the
games) are a good way to have
fun during this term.”

Plans for next year include
broadening the scope of the
games to include other sports
besides basketball.

And you thought the Roanoke-
W&L basketball games were ex-
citing.

then won three of four but ended
up losing four of its last five. Da-
ly said that the basic strategy at
the beginning of the season was
to have a man-to-man defense
that would create unsettled
situations for the attack. But
after the Generals opened with
four losses in five games, they
started to use a patient offense
that would hold the ball for as
long as possible. With that ap-
proach, W&L went 3-1 and had
its best showing in three years
against Virginia.

Another losing streak follow-
ed, but Daly pointed to the
overall record (4-4) under the
new strategy. Referring to the
losses to Denison, UMBC and
Washington, Daly said that the
team did not execute the game
plan, especially when it came to
taking high percentage shots.

as any in the past. Two addi-
tions, Cornell and Yale, will be
away games over spring break.
North Carolina will return to the
schedule for another away
game. The home schedule is
made up of Maryland, Virginia,
Roanoke, Duke, U.M.B.C. and
Middlebury. The number of mid-
week games was reduced from
six to three. Said Daly, ‘This
will eliminate some class con-
flicts for the players. I felt this
was a concern for us this year.”’
He added that having fewer mid-
week games will help the team
be better prepared for games the
following weekend.

The Generals will play an
alumni game at 3 p.m. on Satur-
day at Wilson Field. The alumni
squad will feature members of
the 1974 team which finished
with a record of 15-1 and advanc-
ed as far as the semifinals of the

Cannon, Mize go for

Division Ill crowns

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee tennis
players Craig Cannon and Roby
Mize began singles and doubles
competition today in the NCAA
Division III National Champion-
ships at Emory University in
Atlanta, Ga. The tournament
has a 64-man draw in singles
competition, while 32 teams are
competing for the doubles title.
The tournament is scheduled to
end Sunday.

Cannon, team captain and a
senior, enters the tournament
with a regular season singles
record of 14-7 and a single rank-
ing among Division III tennis
players in the country of 25.

Mize, a freshmen, enters the
tournament with a 14-9 record
and ranked 41. Cannon and Mize
compiled a 13-7 record as a
doubles team and achieved a No.
29 ranking. Head tennis coach
Gary Franke remarked, how-
ever, that the Cannon/Mize
team has defeated teams ranked
ahead of them since the coaches
released the last rankings and
that they are now probably rank-
ed as high as 25th.

Assessing the Generals’
chances at the national tourna-
ment, Franke believes that the
top 30 players in the 64-man
singles draw are capable of win-
ning the championship. Coach
Franke added, “It (the cham-
pionship) depends on who can
put it all together and have a
good weekend of tennis.”’

Rain and bad weather have
prevented Cannon and Mize
from practicing as much as they
would like, but Craig said he

believes that he is prepared for
the tournament.

“It’s hard to get motivated
after a long season, but I feel
ready,’ Cannon said. Cannon
would like to make it at least to
the round of 16, which means he
has to win his first two matches.
He said he believes he can reach
the round of 16, but he also
stresses the importance of his
first round match. Cannon said,
“The first round match is
always the hardest because you
area little nervous and uptight.”
He added that a victory in the
first round builds a player’s con-
fidence and gives him momen-
tum.

Concerning doubles, Mize said
he believes that he and Cannon
are playing very well as a team.
Mize said, ‘Since the beginning
of the season we have been try-
ing to become familiar with each
other’s tendencies on the court ‘‘
Mize believes that he and Can-
non played their best together in
capturing the ODAC doubles ti-
tle earlier this month. He also
belives that he and Cannon have
made a lot of progress this
season as they acquired more
experience playing together.
“We lost a lot of matches earlier
in the season that we would not
lose now,”’ Mize said.

Cannon has represented W&L
in singles and doubles competi-
tion at the NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championships, however,
Mize will be playing in the na-
tional championships for the
first time. Mize stated, ‘‘It’s go-
ing to be a learning experience,
but that doesn’t mean I’m going
to write it off as a freshman lear-
ning experience. I’m going for
it!”
