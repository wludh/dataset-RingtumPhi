EC president calls incident ‘honest oversight’

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

A case of jury tampering by
Student Body President Bob
Jenevein resulted in the strik-
ing of a juror prior to the public
honor hearing Monday.

Jenevein, who argued the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s case in the
trial along with Vice President
David Judge, spoke to the juror,
‘Scott John Fitzgerald, on Satur-
day.

Fitzgerald said that Jenevein
approached him and another
student, Emory Edwards, at
the Board of Trustees luncheon
Saturday.

Although specifics were not
discussed, honor in general was
discussed.

‘‘My intention was just to say
‘hi’ to some other students,”’
Jenevein said. ‘‘At the time it
never crossed my mind that it
would be questioned.”

Fitzgerald, a member of the
Class of 1984, said, ‘For my
part, I thought it was pretty
harmless.”

Jenevein, Fitzgerald and Ed-
wards all agree on the facts of
the incident, including that the
specifics of Monday’s trial were
not discussed.

Fitzgerald told Jenevein and
Edwards that a juror from a
previous public honor trial had
told him that the deliberations
had centered on the ethics of
‘‘booting’”’ someone rather than
on guilt or innocence.

‘“‘T wouldn’t have that pro-
blem. I could try a case on its
facts,’ Fitzgerald said he told
Jenevein.

According to Edwards, Jene-
vein mentioned the incident to
senior law representative Jim
Green because of the potential
effect on the outcome of the
hearing, in which the two de-
fendants were acquitted. Green
raised the question with Student
Bar Association President Kel-
ly Wrenn prior to the hearing to
ensure a fair trial, Edwards
said.

Fitzgerald was informed that

he had been struck from the
jury when he reported to the
trial Monday morning.

‘] think I could have tried the
case on its merits,’’ Fitzgerald
said. ‘I figured if there was a
policy of non-contact with the
jurors, Bob wouldn’t have sat
down — assuming he knew
about it.”’

Jenevein called the incident
an “honest oversight’” and ‘“‘un-

fortunate, given the waves it’s
caused.”

‘“Tt’s unfortunate when
something like this comes up,
but it reminds us to be careful
with the Honor System,’’ he
said.

Jenevein added that after
discussing the matter with
Wrenn, all parties agreed that
Fitzgerald could be struck from
the jury without jeopardizing
the fairness of the trial.

Trustees hike tuition,
endorse party pavilion

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
University Board of Trustees
decided last weekend to begin a
comprehensive study of the
coeducation question.

Board rector (chairman)
James M. Ballengee said that
the study would be ‘‘as thorough
and as systematic as possible.”’

In other action, the Board:

e Approved a tuition of $6515
for next year, up $715 from this
year;

¢ Endorsed the idea of a stu-
dent pavilion and the proposed
student tax to partially finance
it;

e Formed a Campus Life
Committee, which becomes the
seventh committee of the
Board.

Ballengee said that the for-
mation of such a committee has
been under consideration for
some time.

‘‘We didn’t have a committee
that focused on the residential
life of the University, and we
thought that would be valua-
ble,”’ he said.

The rector said the commit-
tee is responsible for Board
matters involving co-curricular
and extracurricular activities,
the dining hall, the fraternities
and ‘“‘all residential aspects of
Washington and Lee.’’

He said the committee’s work
will involve ‘‘some visitation to
campus.”

The committee will be
chaired by H. Gordon Leggett
Jr. of Lynchburg.

The Board met in committees
Friday morning and gathered
as a body to approve committee
recommendations on Saturday.

Friday afternoon was devoted
to an extensive discussion of
coeducation.

Rapist given 50-year sentence

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A Lexington man was found
guilty in Rockbridge Circuit
Court yesterday for the Sept. 15
rape of a Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College student at a
Washington and Lee fraternity.

Daniel R. Tinsley, 21, of 224
Maury St., was convicted by an
eight-woman, four-man jury for
the rape which occured about
3:45 a.m. at Pi Kappa Alpha
following a party there.

He was sentenced to 50 years

in prison by Circuit Court Judge
George E. Honts III.
Commonweatlh’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘‘John’’ Read called
three Washington and Lee stu-
dents to the stand in his pro-
secution of the case. The stu-
dents testified that they had
seen Tinsley with the victim on
the third floor of the fraternity
house the night of the rape.
Under questioning by Read,
Tinsley testified that on the the
night of the rape he had been to
a party at a nearby fraternity
but had not entered the Pika

house. Tinsley said he returned
home that night about 2 a.m.

When Read questioned Tin-
sley about the identity of the
victim Tinsley referred to her
previous testimony.

“I can say in my heart that
that’s the first time she (the vic-
tim) has ever seen me.”

Forensics tests showed that
the type of pubic hair found at
the scene of the attack cor-
responded to Tinsley’s.

At the time of the rape,
Tinsley was on parole for a

Review and Outlook

Cold policies

The public honor trial on Monday raised a number
of questions concerning the use of cold materials.
Although the precise issues in the case on trial seem-
ed clear cut, there are many peripheral issues that
should be addressed by the faculty so that further con-
fusion can be avoided.

 

The use of cold materials is increasingly common
at W&L. Many professors recommend it as a useful
study method. Volumes of cold tests are provided in
the library during exam periods.

But complications can arise when cold answers
enter the consideration. Any time cold materials are
used there is an inherent risk in that their use could
represent another student’s work to some extent.
Clear distinctions can be drawn when cold material is
used for study purposes, but confusion occurs when
cold answers are used in any way to answer home-
work or test questions.

The key to avoiding this type of confusion lies with
the individual faculty members. Each course is u-
nique and cold material is consequently used in a
wide range of ways. As with the case Monday, pro-
blems can be sidestepped if the instructor adresses all
types of study aids, especially cold material, and sets
the -guidelines for his particular course. Such in-
dividual policy setting, we think, would be a much
more advantageous solution than a university-wide
policy. Such a policy would only quickly become laden
with footnotes, explanations and exemptions par-
ticular to each course which would make it com-
paratively ineffective.

Although the bitter circumstances in which these
questions were raised are far from desirable, it is for-
tunate that they have been brought to light.

Letters

EC fails to represent students

To the Editors:

I am responding to the letter
from Bob Jenevein that was
printed in the Jan. 27 Phi. I
would like to point out to Mr.
Jenevein that the Executive
Committee is based upon the
idea of representative student
government, and unfortunately,
I don’t feel that my interests are
being represented. This feeling
springs from two sources, the
EC’s treatment (particularly
Jenevein) of the Independent
Union, and the controversial tie

issue.

First of all I would like to ad-
dress a number of points that
Mr. Jenevein put forth in his let-
ter. First of all, I’m not sure
who he encountered, but the In-
dependent Union had a very
large turn-out for their first

‘meeting. Secondly, I did not

realize that the ‘‘chucklings”’ of
a few of Mr. Jenevein’s friends
was a decision-making factor of
the EC’s budgetary decisions or
the legitimacy of the I.U.

Next, if 40 percent, even 10

percent of the W&L population
were ‘“camel-watchers” and
they set up an organized union
consisting of executive posi-
tions, a large membership and
some common goal, then I
would expect that they should
be able to receive a little of the
money that is supposed to be
used for their benefit. My God,
why should the Frisbee Club be
granted funds, and the Indepen-
dent Union be forced to live out
of Dean John and Dean Cappet-

‘We already have coeducation’

To the Editors:

Some young men, for various
reasons, find it very helpful to
have their masculinity, or sense
of sexual identity, reinforced by
experiencing for several years
in later adolescence a strictly

masculine enviornment. Such
an environment, such an at-
mosphere, was once provided
by our university. No more. A
choice? Meaningless.

In my time the faculty was all
male. There were no girls in the
classes. For sanitary reasons,

Student views requested

To the Editors:

The Calendar Committee is
seeking the views of the student
body regarding the academic
calendar. This questionnaire is
designed to obtain information
and suggestions concerning the
present calendar.

As you consider answering
this questionnaire, keep in mind
that any change from our pre-
sent calendar may entail
changes in both student load
(probably 5 courses in a
semester system) and faculty

load (probably 4 sections in a
semester system) as well as
changes in the daily class
schedules.

We would appreciate an early
reply to this questionnaire, and
we hope to hear from each of
you by February 24th. You may
pickup (starting February 20th)
and return this questionnaire to
the boxes placed in the Dining
Hall, Library, Co-op and
Registrar’s office.

Trial sparks comments

To the Editors:
The recent open honor trial
was a gross miscarriage of

justice and disgrace to the

honorable traditions of this in-
stitution. This farce exemplifies
some of the weaknesses of our
honor system that most certain-
ly should be mended. Although
both defendants admitted to us-
ing ‘‘unacknowledged aid’’ on
the assignment, without in-
cluding this in their pledge, they
were not convicted. We care too
much for the traditions of the
honor system to see them so
blatantly ignored.

Restraint

gives way
To the Editor:

I’ve calmly refrained fron,
commenting on the often
ridiculous commentary
emanating from coeducation
and its related issues over the
last few months because I felt
that everyone was entitled to
his opinion, But, unfortunately,
I can tolerate only so much.

Whose opinion, other than its
own, was the EC expressing last
week when it resolved that a
recommendation should be
made to the faculty that we

(continued on page 3)

The main weakness we
observed was the inequality of
the legal counsel. We find no
fault with Mr. Jenevein and Mr.
Judge, nor with the advocates
of the accused. But, the ad-
vocates for the EC did not have
the luxury of two-and-a-half
years of legal training to aid in
the presentation of their case.
We also believe that decisions

Correction

Because of a reporter’s error,
the Executive Committee’s vote
on coeducation was incorrectly
reported in last week’s Ring-
tum Phi. The correct vote was
11-0-1 against coeducation, with
Secretary Len Howard abstain-

ing.
Clarification
The Ring-tum Phi apologizes
for any confusion caused by last
week’s issue, which included an
eight-page Front Lawn supple-
ment on Virginia Military In-
stitute. A pressman’s error
caused The Front Lawn pages
to be mistakenly shuffled into
The Ring-tum Phi pages, in-
stead of being kept as a
separate center supplement.

bathing suits were not permit-
ted in the pool.
Today we have many female

' teachers, a fair number of girls

in the classrooms. Nude swim-
ming is not even an option, with
women allowed in the pool.

Let us not fool ourselves. The
masculine atmosphere is gone.
We already have coeducation.
Let us either phase out these in-
novations, or go the whole way.

I am adamantly opposed to
even the slightest increase in
the enrollment. I would rather
cut it to 1,300. And let us have no
sort of quota system for girls.
Let us admit students, not boys
and girls.

Media celebrities battle over necktie story

By BEN HALE
Phi Columnist

To tie or not to tie — that is
the question these days. It
seems to be an especially im-
portant question to the news
media. Actually the folks at The
Washington Post, The Roanoke
Times and World News, Rolling
Stone magazine, Good Morning
America and even George F.
Will are more concerned about
the EC tie recommendation
than most students around
here. I have been curious as to
why the media seems so con-
cerned about neckwear at our
little college in the Valley of
Virginia. Finally I decided to
get on the phone and find out,

putting in a call to Good Morn-
ing America. After several
minutes on hold, I was put
through to Clyde Crumbum,
David Hartman’s personal
secretary. He seemed to be try-
ing to hustle me off the phone
until I told him I had called
about the ties; he then became
very cordial.

I told Clyde that I just wanted
to know why Good Morning
America had jumped on the lit-
tle obscure issue of our dress
code. “Because,” he said,

Public trial results in

hypocrisy about honor

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

It is rare these days that a
student can spend a few hours

on the hill without hearing at

least one conversation between
students about any of the recent
actions of the Executive Com-
mittee. In the wake of charges
of student apathy, students are
~ now furiously chattering about
issues ranging from ties to the
Independent Union. Conse-
quently, many students have
come to know the members of
the EC both as individuals and
as a body in their student
government roles. Although re-
cent decisions have made
students painfully aware that
the members of the EC are
responsible for being represen-
tative of the students, many of

us, itseems, have forgotten that .

the EC also shoulders the
responsibility of upholding the
Honor System.

Comment

 

On Monday the University ex-
perienced a rare occurrence in
the public honor trial held in
Lee Chapel. A student had been
found guilty of an honor viola-
tion in a closed hearing and ap-
pealed to a jury of his peers for
a new judgment. To all but the
freshmen, such -public honor
trials are becoming increasing-
ly common. It is in these public
trials, and Monday was no dif-
ferent, that many students
forget that the EC also strives
to uphold the Honor System.

At times Monday, members
of the audience at. the trial
snickered, sneered, whispered
and laughed at the attempts by
Bob Jenevein and Dave Judge
to argue and prove their case to
the student jury. Finally, after
almost 11 hours of trial and jury
deliberation, the verdict was

announced. Audience members
cheered in unmistakeable de-
fiance of the EC and its then-
overturned ruling. Such a reac-
tion by any member of the W&L
student body, no matter the cir-
cumstance, is grossly inap-
propriate.

We at W&L take great pride
in our Honor System. It is rare,
if not unique, in that it has
withstood the onslaught of
changing generations and
values. The Honor System
works and because it does we
like to consider ourselves
‘gentlemen.’ It is this pride in
our Honor System and the con-
current show of disrespect for it
by more than a few students
Monday night which produces a
most embarrassing kind
hypocrisy.

Each year we elect the mem-
bers of the Executive Commit-
tee. They are the popular choice
for the job and all of its duties.
We also still rely on a confiden-
tial Honor System in which we
trust those elected members to
do their best in trying a student.
As the EC must perform part of
its job in secret, and as we still
uphold such a_ confidential
system, no one is justified in ac-
cusing it of trying to convict a
student outside the letter of the
law as defined in The White
Book.

But it was apparent Monday
that a number of such hypo-
crites were present. There they
were jeering and chuckling at
Jenevein and Judge who at that
point were the very embodi-
ment of the Honor System to
which we all cling desperately.
Many students quibble with the
EC members as student govern-
ment leaders and that is only
natural. But when we show that
same antagonism toward them
as they strive to ensure as best
they know how the survival of
the Honor System, our
hypocrisy is shameful.

“W&L is is spearheading the in-
evitable national swing toward
right-dress, and besides, we had
to act quickly to beat the Today
Show.” He went on to explain
that their sources confirmed
that Jane Pauley was trying to
slot Bob Jenevein and Jerry
Darrell even before the EC’s tie
vote, saying that she had
predicted the vote for months.

“This can’t be true,’’ I pro-
tested.

“Oh no,” Clyde replied, ‘‘This
is a tough business and a very
real issue. I am not kidding.
Besides we morning shows
must compete against the eve-
ning news shows. But there’s
where the real fight is bubbling
over the tie exclusive.”’

‘What fight?” says I, becom-
ing numb with disbelief.

‘‘Well,”’ Clyde chuckled, “‘the
word is that Bill Moyers and
Walter Cronkite are at logger
heads over who called first on
the feature.’’

“This isn’t the type story for
either of their shows, not to
mention...”

“Oh, this story has so many
leads it could fit on almost any
spot. I heard this morning that
Charles Kuralt was heading

down 11 South today.” I was
dumbfounded, but before I
could express my _ astonish-
ment, Clyde lowered his voice
to a whisper. ‘‘And,’’ he said,
“Tl let you know a secret.
Geraldo Rivera is planning a
big spot on the next 20/20 featur-
ing Jim Green, Markham Pyle,
Eddie Atwood and Dick
Miller.”’

“Hmmm,’’ I said, ‘‘Why isn’t
Bob Jenevein going to be on?’’
Clyde explained that Geraldo
had promised Time Magazine
the Jenevein exclusive. ‘“‘What
about President Wilson?”’ I ask-
ed.

“Oh,” Clyde said, “‘the show
only lasts one hour and he
thinks it would take a series to
get Wilson to address the
issue.”

I was almost chuckling with
shock and said, ‘I suppose
you’re going to tell me 60
Minutes is going to run the
ties.”’

‘‘They were,’’ Clyde
answered. ‘‘but Mike Wallace is
angry at Geraldo for beating
him to the draw and now says
he wouldn’t touch it. But I think
they’re making a big mistake.
Parade magazine is going to hit

it Sunday and then the flood
gates will open.”’

‘“‘Wait!’’ I half shouted, ‘‘why
in the world is everyone so in-
terested in this?”

“Oh my, you really don’t have
a clue,’’ Clyde sighed. He ex-
plained that it is known around
Washington that Jerry Falwell
is pushing the President to re-
quire ties on all government
employees at all times; he also
wants the president to recom-
mend to Tip O’Neil that con-
gressmen wear ties at all times
while in the D.C. city limits.
Clyde said everyone is convinc-
ed that Reagan agrees because
lately he has been walking
around the White House re-
citing a new Bible verse about
bare necks being the root of all
evil.

I was stupefied when Clyde
started to ask what I thought. I
began to try to explain how I
thought it would be nice if cer-
tain W&L traditions re-sprang
from their dormant roots. But
before I could address the ties
specifically, Clyde was rushing
me off the phone, saying some-
thing about a phone interview
with the W&L _ Bookstore
clothing selection staff at noon.

 

More ties

(continued from page 2)
students be required to wear
ties? Obviously, someone has
lost his mind making such a
recommendation without even
first consulting the student
body. Five members of the EC
are my fraternity brothers and
no members of my house knew
about this until we read it in The
Phi. Is that what the EC con-
siders responsible decision-
making?

The situation was bad
enough, but then the fearless
leader of the EC, Bob Jenevein,
was quoted in The Roanoke
Times and World News, as say-
ing that the wearing of ties
would further promote
homogeneity at W&L. Is he im-
plying that W&L needs to
become more homogeneous?
Come on now, James Watt
would not even make a com-
ment that ridiculous. But, none-
the-less, Bob did.

Tell me, is what we have now
at W&L a picture of multi-
dimensionality? I seriously
doubt that even the staunchest
of conservatives among us can
even begin to imagine a more
homogeneous community than
our little refuge on the Blue
Ridge.

Steve Matrazzo said it very
well last term when he noted
that the main reason W&L need-
ed coeducation was to relieve
the one-dimensionality that ex-
ists here in Lexington. Maybe
going coed is too great a step in
that direction for too many peo-
ple to fathom, but by reacting
with moves in the opposite
direction is not the solution to

«~ our problem.

If everyone would take the
time to read the University’s
formal statement on_ its
philosophy. in the catalogue,
they~would see that the main
purpose of this institution is the
development of minds in a
climate that stresses the impor-
tance of the individual. In no
way does this philosophy imply
homogeneity, conformity, or
what ever you want to label the
sitnation at W&L.

Prof. J.K. Jennings made a

Independents

(continued from page 2)
to’s pockets?

We as independents should be
given some consideration when
the budget is planned, and Mr.
Jenevein’s personal rantings
should not be taken too serious-
ly. Which brings me to my next
humorous consideration — the
issue of ‘‘asking”’ the faculty to
require us to wear ties to class.
This is very funny; the EC has
decided to say to the faculty on
an individual basis, ‘‘oh please
may we wear ties to your
class?” If the EC and/or
anyone else wants to wear ties
to class then the more power to
them, but I don’t feel it is
necessary for you to cry to the
teacher that I should wear a tie
too. The comment that springs
to mind is, “If I wanted to wear
a uniform, I would have gone to
VMI.”

Is this representation? I find
this more to be the instigation of
a few students who want to im-
pose their personal habits on

very noteworthy comment
when he said that when you re-
quire someone to conform to
tradition, that tradition ceases
to exist and becomes a rule.

The question we must ask
ourselves is do we really need
more rules. Hopefully the EC
will think about that (or at least
just think) the next time it
comes up with one of its
brilliant ideas.

more weight. The EC members
are not monsters trying to ruin
the lives of all Washington and

ing to maintain the traditions

 

which General Lee had in mind
when he created the honor
system.

We don’t feel that we are
alone in this position, but rather
that a large portion of the stu-
dent body was horrified by the
scene that recently took place in
Lee Chapel. In closing, we
would like to repeat the words
we heard repeatedly abused
Monday night: WE OBJECT.

Trustees give ‘tentative’ approval to pavilion

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees last
weekend approved the pavilion
project, with the size of the
building to be determined by
University President John D.
Wilson in ‘“‘direct consultation”
with Athletic Director William
N. McHenry

The student tax proposal sub-
mitted by the Executive Com-
mittee of the Student Body was
also endorsed by the Board.

Wilson said the trustees gave
the proposed student pavilion
“tentative approval, pending an
administrative recommenda-
tion and the May board
meeting.’”’

“The decision will come in
two parts,”’ he said. ‘‘We didn’t
have a clear decision on which
of the optional plans the Board
is willing to endorse, because of
the difference in capital costs.

“There will be a final recom-
mendation of the administra-
tion after we’ve refined our cost
and size figures,” he added.
“But I don’t think we’re losing
any time this way.”’

Frank Parsons, executive
assistant to the president and a
staff assistant to the Board’s
Planning and Development
Committee, said he expects
construction can begin by June
1.

‘“‘My expectation is that we
will resolve the size issue, pro-
ceed with planning and begin
building,” he said.

Parsons estimates that the
structure will be ready for use
five months after construction
is begun.

The pavilion, which has been
designed to accomodate be-
tween 1000 and 1200 students,
will be named for former
University President Robert
E.R. Huntley.

The site, one of three which
were considered, is in the pine
woods directly north of Lewis
Hall, about 500 feet from the

plex.

Two floor plans were
presented to the Planning and
Development committee.

One contained 7,440 square
feet of activity space (11,976
total), and one had 9,692 square
feet of activity space (14,700
total).

An additional plan was also
submitted for each of those
sizes, but with flooring,
lighting, and ceiling height
adapted for use by the athletic
department.

It is the latter two plans which
are under consideration.

The smaller size with the
higher ceiling, Parsons said,
was “no larger than the Student
Activities Board felt would
work for them, and no smaller
than the athletic department
thought would work for them.”

When President Wilson
reviewed the options, Parsons
said he viewed that plan ‘‘as be-
ing a reasonable compromise
among the needs of the S.A.B.,
the needs of the athletic depart-
ment, and the ability of the
University to provide additional
funds.”’

McHenry was one of those
present at the committee
meeting to assist in explaining
the features of the various plans
to the trustees.

“The committee felt that
some of the points made by Mr.
McHenry in response to ques-
tions from the trustees created
a strong argument for the
larger building,” Parsons said.

“They felt that perhaps
another look should be taken at
the feasibility of funding the
larger building.”

The financing plan approved
by the trustees calls for $25 of
the student taxes from each stu-
dent for the next 25 years to be
used as the student contribution
to the funding of the building.

Figuring enrollment at 1700
students per year yields
$1,062,500, of which $404,000 is
the principal on a loan at 9.5
percent from the University.

“The University would make
the funds available from the en-
dowment at this rate, which is
in line with the lending policies
of the University,’’ Parsons ex-
plained.

The difference between the
student contribution and the
proposed cost will be made up
by the trustees from the capital
projects budget.

In the case of the smaller
building, that would be $178,053

(total estimated cost: $582,053) ;
for the larger building, that
would be $273,475 (total
estimated cost. $677,475).

Parsons said that while the
resources available are limited,
“there were never any thoughts
expressed in Planning and
Development about limiting the
building to student funding on-
l eae
"He said that President Wilson
will make a recommendation on
the size ‘‘very soon.”’

“If there is any merit
discovered in the larger size,
then the final decision to con-

duct planning on that may
await the budget analysis we
will be going through very
shortly,’’ Parsons said.

“That will determine the
amount of capital available. It
may be that we can’t afford to
build the bigger building even if
we want to.”

Parsons said the Budget and
Audit Committee has a meeting
in the early spring at which it
determines a_ preliminary
budget, with final approval
coming at the May trustee
meeting.

‘In formal terms, approval

for the pavilion would come at
the May meeting. But in prac-
tical terms it would come when
the budget is finalized,”’ he said.

“At that point, it might be
possible to proceed with the
plans, and begin some
preliminary site work before
the May meeting.

“We don’t think there’ll be
any change in the trustees’ at-
titude toward the building.”

“The students have been very
creative and very positive in the
way they’ve approached it and
their willingness to be involved
through the tax,” Parsons said.

Trustees initiate coed study,
schedule meeting for July 13

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The Board of Trustees last
weekend initiated an intensive
review of the possibility of ad-
mitting women to the Universi-
ty’s undergraduate program.

The study will be conducted
by the standing committees of
the Board, and will include a.
systematic survey of alumni
opinion on the question.

A tentative special session of
the Board was set for July 13-14
to assess the results of the in-
quiry. The subject will also be
discussed at the regularly
scheduled May 25-26 meeting.

Two sessions last weekend
were devoted to coeducation.

Board Rector (chairman)
James M. Ballengee said that
those were primarily
‘‘procedural rather than
substantive” in nature.

“I didn’t try to test the
temperature of the water at
all,”’ Ballengee said Tuesday.
‘I hope everyone still has an
open mind on the question.

“The Board has an obligation
to make a decision that’s in the
best interests of the University,
regardless of personal feelings.

“This is of course, a very im-
portant decision,” he continued.
‘‘Kither way, it will have great
consequences for the Universi-
ty.
“There has been a great deal
of heat on this question. Now we
hope there’Il be more light.”

“Each committee is free to
set its own agenda,’ said
University President John D.
Wilson. ‘‘It will be totally up to

them to do what they want to
about this.

“T will be working with each
chairman to help them relate to
the relevant groups on cam-
pus,”’ he said.

Each committee will have a
liaison in the administration to
assist it in its study.

The Committee on Academic

- Affairs, Wilson said, will ex-

amine staffing patterns, course
enrollment patters, classroom
and faculty office space, and
what changes would need to be
anticipated in those areas.

Working with Dean of the Col-
lege William J. Watt, the com-
mittee will also examine admis-
sions projections and _ alter-
natives, and new initiatives
which could be taken there.

Additionally, Academic Af-
fairs will look at the overall size
of the undergraduate school,
and how that size could or
should shrink or expand.

The new Committee on Cam-
pus Life, assisted by Dean of
Students Lewis G. John, will
assess the possible effects of
coeducation on the athletic pro-
gram and the fraternity
system.

The Planning and Develop-
ment Committee, in conjunc-
tion with Development Director
Farris P. Hotchkiss, will deal
with alumni reactions and in-
put, and, Wilson says, deter-
mine how communications can
be maintained with that group.

The Committee on Budget
and Audit, along with Universi-
ty Treasurer E. Stewart Epley,
will examine the impact of
coeducation on operating costs
and assess the capital and
renovative costs involved.

They also will look at the
number of students enrolled
and determine if present policy
should continue, or if the
number should shrink or ex-

pand.

Wilson said that the Ex-
ecutive Committee, which he
chairs, “thas the most difficult
task of all.

“We will be looking at the in-
tangibles — the spirit of Wash-
ington and Lee, its purpose, its
institutional character, and the
factors that make Washington
and Lee distinctive.

“‘We will make an evaluation
of its all-male character in that
context.”

Wilson said that this under-
taking is warranted, in spite of
the extensive study completed
in August 1975.

“Things change,’’ he said.
“The society has changed
some. We have a deeper set ot
institutional experiences to
draw on — Princeton, for exam-
ple.

‘We know a lot more about
this than we could have in 1975.

“Faculty opinion hasn’t
changed in any dramatic way,”
he continued. ‘‘Student opinion
will have changed — I’m not
sure how much.

“Life is a moving stream, and
so, too, are our social institu-
tions. They move, too, over
time.

‘We want to know how the
quality of Washington and Lee’s
academic, co-curricular and ex-
tracurricular programs can be
enhanced,” he said.

“Coeducation is clearly a
very conspicuous option among
others. But my hope is that,
should the Board decide to re-
main all-male, we will emerge
from this with a_ sharper,
clearer idea of how Washington
and Lee’s all-male character
contributes to its distinc-
tiveness.

“We won’t be content to say
that we’re all-male because we
haven’t yet been compelled to
change.”’

Wilson recently received a
letter dated Jan. 30 from a
trustee. It read in part:

‘“‘My mind remains quite open
on the coeducation issue, and it
is my intention to consider
every fact, opinion, concept,
perception, prediction, and idea
before deciding how I shall
vote.”

The Ring-tum Phi, February 9, 1984, Page 5

 

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The tuition of $6,515 for the
1984-85 academic year which

was approved by the Board of -

Trustees last weekend repre-
sents a 12.3 percent increase
over this year’s fee of $5,800.

“We try to keep it as low as
possible,”’ said University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley.
“We’re in good shape, com-
pared to other private institu-
tions.

“‘We haven’t priced ourselves
‘way beyond Wake Forest,
Duke, or Davidson,”’ he con-
tinued.

“Several trustees expressed
the sentiment that we could go

higher if we had to and still be

competitive with our indepen-
dent competitors.

“If anything, we’ve been on
the low side,”’ he said. ‘‘Now I
suspect we’re getting up so
we’re more comparable.

“Of course, we’re getting far-
ther and farther apart from
public institutions, of which we
have three in our own back-

yard,” he said, referring to the
University of Virginia, William
and Mary, and the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Initially, the tuition to be pro-
posed to the Budget and Audit
Committee was $6,500, but
Epley said that ‘last minute
refinements’’ increased it
slightly.

For purposes of planning the
budget for the fiscal year which
begins July 1, the University
projected inflation at 5 percent.

Epley pointed out several |

reasons that the tuition increase
is well above that rate.

All of the University’s sources
of revenue do not increase with
the cost of living, and, in fact,
the amount available for the
operating budget from two ma-
jor pools of capital will
decrease next year, he said.

The trustees this weekend
adopted what Epley called a
“more prudent’ formula for
determining the amount availa-
ble in a given year from the the
endowment and the Pratt Fund.

“It makes fewer dollars

available,’ the treasurer said.
“If the rules were in effect that
applied this year, there would
be $75,000 more available than
will be under the new rules.”

Another factor in the increase
is a reserve capital provision
which is being instituted next
year.

Also, Epley said that Presi-
dent John Wilson is _inter-
ested in increasing the level
of compensation for the faculty.

The Chronicle of Higher
Education reported on Feb. 8
that the average faculty
salaries at Washington and Lee
for the 1982-83 academic year,
not including fringe benefits,
are as follows:

Professor, $34,300; Associate
Professor, $25,000; Assistant
Professor, $21,300; and Instruc-
tor, $15,500.

Director of Admissions
William M. Hartog said that,
while ‘the cost structure
always has a significant im-
pact’’ on admissions, ‘‘our costs
are very competitive.

FC votes not to request ties

Decision ends two weeks of discussion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Faced with a petition signed
by 383 students, the Executive
Committee voted Sunday not to
ask the faculty to require ties in
the classrooms and merely en-
couraged students to wear ties
on campus.

Senior Mark Mitschow, with a

tie wrapped around his waist,
protested the EC’s original de-
cision two weeks ago to ask fac-
ulty members to require their
ty members to require tneir
students to wear ties to class.
The petition accused the EC of
making an “‘ill-timed and
ludicrous” decision that ‘does
not reflect the views of the stu-
dent body as a whole,” without
any input from the student
body.
“We wish to remind the EC
that they are neither autocrats
nor potentates,” the petition
continued, ‘‘but elected
representatives of the student
body.”

About 30 students were
shoehorned into the EC room
for Sunday’s debate during a
special meeting originally call-
ed to discuss the open exam pro-
posal, which was adopted
unanimously.

EC President Bob Jenevein
defended the original decision
but also pointed out the
clarification approved by the
EC the previous week.

“It’s the opinion of this com-
mittee that (the wearing of ties)
is a good thing,”’ Jenevein said.
“This committee admits that
we were out of line to (recom-
mend) that.

“We don’t pretend to tell peo-
ple how they can and cannot
dress.’’

Mitschow, who said about 10
man-hours were spent obtain-
ing signatures on the petitions,
said his biggest complaint was
that the EC didn’t get any sense
of student opinion before acting
on the issue.

“What bothered the people
was that one day they woke up
and they looked at the EC
minutes and they said, ‘Wow,
the EC has done this without
asking anyone,’”’ Mitschow
said.

“They’re very resentful and
I’m very resentful,”’ he added.

Senior Lee Feldman said he
supported the EC’s decision
because the EC members are
elected representatives of the
student body and can’t consult
every student.

“They’re going to consult the
people who are close at hand,”
Feldman said, ‘‘and I think the
EC’s done that. They did what
was within their bounds and I
think they did it well.”’

Vice president Dave Judge
echoed Feldman’s point. “We
can’t take a referendum on
everything we do here,” he
said.

Just as citizens have the right
to petition their congressmen,
though, Mitschow said, students
have a right to petition the EC.

“I believe you owe them an
explanation,” he added. “‘If a
professor doesn’t like what
someone’s wearing, that’s his
business. That’s not the
business of the Executive Com-
mittee. I would think that you

gentlemen have something bet-
ter to do with your time.”

Jenevein said, ‘“The intention
of this committee was solely to
benefit Washington and Lee. We
felt it would result in an improv-
ed atmosphere in direct propor-
tion to the number of ties
worn.”

Secretary Len Howard said
he believed the EC should have
had a wider discussion on this
issue.

“Even though we are en-
trusted with certain rights and
responsibilities, that doesn’t
mean we're infallible,”” Howard
said.

He added that he stands
behind the original decision, but
made the motion for the EC to
merely explain the issue and its
intentions to the faculty without
asking them to require ties.

Howard’s motion, seconded
by junior representative Darby
Brower, passed unanimously,
ending 30 minutes of debate.

Senior representative Jim
Messer represented the EC at
Monday’s faculty meeting and
said he was well received and
that the faculty understood the
EC’s actions.

Freshman Steve Pockrass
presented another petition,
signed by 105 students, calling
on Jenevein to ‘quote facts,
rather than merely presenting
his own personal opinions” and
to properly represent the stu-
dent body on national televi-
sion.

Jenevein confirmed that he
had been invited to appear on
ABC’s ‘‘Good Morning,

(continued on page 12)

sive private university,” he
said. ‘“‘We are generally quite a
bit less expensive than our
private northeastern com-
petitors, and we’re less than
many schools around the
South.”

Hartog named Washington
and Lee’s primary private
Southern competition as David-
son, Duke and Vanderbilt.

He pointed out that ‘“‘we have
in our own state two presti-
gious, nationally-known public
institutions,’ and said it was in
those two schools and in Chapel
Hill that the most students
enrolled who were also admit-
ted to Washington and Lee.

A survey last September of
371 students who declined ad-
mission to Washington and Lee
showed that 24 percent were in-
fluenced by the cost, and 14 per-
cent named it as the number
one factor in not coming to the
school.

Hartog said that the area in

  

- Tuition to increase to $6,515

which the tuition increase
“really has impact”’ is in finan-
cial aid.

“At a school like this, when
we go up significantly in tuition,
that puts pressure on financial
aid, which has an impact on ad-
missions,’’ he said.

Hartog said this pressure is
partly the result of the fact that
no student’s tuition is used to

_ Supplement another student’s.

“‘We are one of a handful of
schools that does not apply a
percentage of tuition revenue to
financial aid,’’ he said.

That type of “redistribution”
of tuition, he said, is ‘‘a short-
term remedy, but a long-term
disaster,” because ‘‘you have to
keep raising the tuition until
you price yourself out of the
market.”

“I don’t think any of us can
lose sight of the fact that for a
number of years, we have been
a very well-managed, well-run
institution,”’ he said.

Responsive or responsible?

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

One word describes this
year’s Executive Committee
and explains many of the ac-
tions it has taken: homogene-
ous.

Of the ten undergraduate
members, nine belong to frater-
nities, and five belong to the
same fraternity.

Of the 12 members on the EC,
10 — including three from
Texas and three from Georgia
— are from southern states.

Only two of the members had
served on the EC before this
year.

This homogeneity is
represented in nearly every
vote, every decision the EC has
made this year. The closest vote
on an issue of any significance
was a 93 vote not to pay
students to man the polls during
elections. And even the three
(President Bob Jenevein,
sophomore _ representative
James White and freshman
representative Andrew
Caruthers) who voted for the
proposal did so for different
reasons: Caruthers, for exam-
ple, didn’t see a need for anyone
to man the polls at all.

On nearly all other issues,
even such potentially explosive
ones as coeducation, spring
term, Wédnesday night parties
and the wearing of ties, votes
have been unanimous, perhaps,
with an abstention or two.

Perhaps this is due to skillful
behind-the-scenes manipulating
and expert leadership by Jene-
vein. While there seems to be
little question that he confers
with other EC members before
bringing a provocative issue to
the floor, the outcome almost
undoubtedly is a result of the
homogeneity.

This is further exemplified by
the fact that issues often are
resolved with little discussion
and compromise during the
open meetings. What discussion
there is usually consists of dif-
ferent members espousing
basically the same ideas.

Of course, this is not entirely
a fault of the EC, because the
lack of debate on most issues
enables meetings to move
smoothly and questions to be
resolved rapidly. The casual
observer, though, sometimes
gets the opinion that perhaps
not all student interests are be-
ing represented. Then again, if
students want their interests
represented, they can go to an
EC meeting to express them or
at least tell their represen-
tative.

This all boils down to the sim-
ple question of whether the Ex-
ecutive Committee should be
responsive or responsible.

A responsive EC considers
the wishes and desires of every
group of students before mak-
ing a decision. A responsible EC
makes decisions that, although

perhaps not appreciated by
many students, may prove
beneficial to the university.

The 1983-84 EC, thus far, has
been more responsible than
responsive, particularly earlier
this semester through such ac-
tions as denying funds to the In-
dependent Union and asking
professors to require their
students to wear ties to class.

Within the last two weeks,
though, there has been a shift
toward responsiveness as Jene-
vein delayed a decision on the
pavilion for a day and on the
student advisers for a week so
that members would have an
opportunity to sound out their
classmates on these issues.

Following the actions of
previous ECs, this year’s EC
has formed many subcom-
mittees to investigate such
things as social activities in
conjunction with Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, open
exams, independent life and a
gift of appreciation for former
W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley. Most of these subcom-
mittees, with a few exceptions
(R-MWC, independents and ad-
ditional lighting in the parking

Jot), have been effective.

Perhaps the most effective
was the finance subcommittee,
which reviewed all budget re-
quests and made recommenda-
tions to the entire EC, This sub-
committee expedited the
budgetary process tremendous-
ly but again exemplified the
EC’s homogeneity.

Of the finance subcom-
mittee’s 17 recommendations 12
were adopted by the EC, often

unanimously and frequently
with little debate. In past years,
this process has lasted until the
wee hours of the morning. This
year, it was over by 11 p.m.

Again, this is another aspect
of the responsive-responsible
debate. The EC acted respon-
sibly by having most of the in-
itial discussions and debates
take place in the finance sub-
committee. Some would ques-
tion, though, whether having
nearly all debate take place
behind closed doors is respon-
sive,

One problem that could have
plagued the EC this year, but
usually doesn’t appear during
open meetings, is the fact that
10 of the 12 members had never
served on the EC before. Only
junior representatives Darby
Brower and Cole Dawson had
previous EC experience.

Whether this inexperience
has presented any problems in
the EC’s other jurisdiction
—honor cases — is a question
that cannot, of course, be
answered.

As the Executive Committee
turns down the backstretch and
heads for home, with Big Three
elections less than a month
away, it has tackled many
issues of importance to this
university and has tackled most
of them responsibly and has
made some difficult decisions.

Whether these decisions have
been correct and have ac-
curately represented the feel-
ings of the student body are
matters for the voters to decide
next month.

 

 

  

BOB JENEVEIN

Despite the criticism he has
received in the past few weeks,
Executive Committee Presi-
-dent Bob Jenevein seems to
have done a respectable job in a
tough, time-consuming _posi-
tion. ;

Jenevein’s biggest drawback
has been his lack of prior EC ex-
perience, and this occasionally
has shown during meetings and
in other actions. —

On at least two occasions,

Jenevein has said during an~

open meeting something that
was told him confidentially and
afterward had to ask reporters
to refrain from printing it. On
other occasions, Jenevein will
make statements directed espe-
cially for the media present (he
is a political science major),
but his politicking is not a
serious fault.

Jenevein’s' most serious
mistake may have been the
curtness with which he treated
the Independent Union’s budget
request during the Jan. 9
meeting and in a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi. The EC Presi-
dent seemed to forget that 35

percent of his constituency are

independents.

Jenevein may have been
right, though, in charging that
part of the fault lay with the
IU’s inability to assess dues and
meet with the Student Activities
Board. Appointing a subcom-
mittee Oct. 31 to investigate the
problem, he said, ‘‘It’s
(independent life) certainly an
issue that’s come to the
forefront.”

Enough has been written
about the recent tie debate, both
in this newspaper and in others
around the country, so that
everybody should know that
Jenevein apparently still favors
the idea.

The whole question of student
apathy and a dress code seems
to stem from a November
Omicron Delta Kappa sym-
pusium, after which Jenevein
told the EC that the consensus
of the participants was that
“‘we’ve slipped in a lot of dif-
ferent ways,’”’ such as_ the
speaking tradition and the dress
code.

Jenevein must be credited for
turning what could have been a
nasty debate Sunday night into
a reasonably calm discussion of
the tie decisions, resulting in an
outcome that seemed to satisfy
all involved.

Jenevein apparently has
worked closely with President
John Wilson on the coeducation
issue and is to commended for
asking and being allowed, to
participate in last weekend’s

Jenevein’s quibbles may have
been valid, there was little ap-
parent reason to bring them up
during a public meeting.

After criticizing Howard,
Jenevein turned to vice presi-
dent Dave Judge, who had
prepared a memo to all student
organizations about budget
reports and asked the EC to ap-
prove the memo _ without
Judge’s reading it. ‘‘Let’s just
approve what Dave’s done and
trust Dave,’’ Jenevein siad.
“‘That’s a good job, Dave, and I
appreciate it.”

Meetings have run smoothly
and generally under control
thus far this year, but squabbles
among the Big Three must be
resolved if the EC is to achieve
ultimate effectiveness.

As president, Jenevein has
the responsibility for guiding
the EC and for controlling the
meetings and handling _in-
dividual grievances. Drawing
on leadership skills gained as a
co-captain of the football team,
Jenevein has basically ac-
complished those respon-
sibilities. After the necktie
issue, though, increased
pressure will be on him to per-
form with all of the students in
mind.

seems to have made sensible
decisions as to whether the EC
can afford additional expen-
ditures. For example, he ap-
proved of giving the Political
Review an additional $500 for a
second issue and voted against
paying students to man the polls
during EC elections.

Working with SBA treasurer
Cheryl Boggs, Judge helped
establish a new account system
for the SBA that helped clear up
many past problems.

On the pavilion issue, though,
which would involve raising the
student tax by $25, Judge has
had little to say, although he did
support raising the tax.

Judge did represent the stu-
dent body during the meetings
of the Alumni Association and
the Board of Trustees last fall,
when Jenevein was playing
football.

Judge was the major force
behind forcing the Student
Association for Black Unity to
spend its $1,500 on the SABU
Ball, for which the money
originally had been intended.
SABU had planned to split the
money between the ball and a
speaker. Thus, Judge helped
establish a precedent that
organizations must spend their
money for what they say they
are going to spend it for.

After many weeks of confu-
sion, Judge also finally worked
out a schedule for organizations
to present budget reports to the
EC

 

LEN HOWARD

Secretary Len Howard, the
lone independent on the EC, has
done his best to champion the
cause of the independents this
year, but has been out-
numbered on most issues by the
other members of the Big
Three, Jenevein and Judge.

Howard has hurt his cause
somewhat through his chair-
manship of two apparently inef-
fective subcommittees, one to
arrange joint social functions
with Ranolph-Macon Woman’s
College and the other to study
the problems of the in-
dependents.

Formed Sept. 19, the R-MWC

Secretary
Len Howard

committee did not even fill all
its positions until December
and had not scheduled a
meeting until the middle of
January. This may have been a
good idea that never got off the
ground.

The independent subcom-
mittee — as demonstrated by
the antagonism among the In-
dependent Union, the EC and
the SAB — seems to have done
little toward that problem.

Howard’s failure on many oc-
casions to post the minutes of
EC meetings until several days
after the meeting also has hurt
him and brought some criticism
from Jenevein. However, the
minutes generally have been
accurate.

The highlight of Howard’s
year thus far may have been his
ability to forge a compromise
Sunday between the EC and
students protesting the necktie
decision. When the meeting
threatened to degenerate into a
shouting match, Howard seized

the initiative and introduced a
proposal acceptable to
everyone.

Howard did write a letter re-
questing the hiring of a student
organization secretary. Wheth-
er this will produce any
results is yet to be seen.

When Contact’s budget re-
quest came before the EC,
Howard was the sole person to
vote against granting the
organization $9,400, because it
was more than Contact would
be receiving from the Inter
Fraternity Council.

‘“‘Why the decision to hit the
EC for 13 (thousand dollars,
Contact’s original request) and
the IFC for only eight? Is it real-
ly fair for the EC to foot the
larger portion of the bill?”
Howard asked.

In the weeks ahead, Howard
may have to take even more in-
itiative while diligently per-
forming his usual duties if he is
to get anywhere against the
homogeneity of the EC.

 

 

DARBY BROWER

Jumwor representative

Darby Brower

Junior representative Darby
Brower, the only member of the
EC who also served last year,
has used his experience to con-
tribute greatly to the EC’s ac-
tivities this year.

Brower’s work with the Stu-
dent Activities Board in for-
mulating the plans for the stu-
dent activities building
(pavilion) apparently was
momentous and may benefit
generations of students to
come. He originally began
working on the pavilion idea
last spring and has not stopped
since.

Brower also has spoken out
against giving additional
money to organizations he

doesn’t feel deserve it, such as
the Independent Union (‘I
would find it impossible to give
you all any money”’) and the In-
ternational Club for the Mock
United Nations (“I myself
would be upset, let alone the
people who are paying the tax-

‘es.’’) The rest of the EC agreed

with him in both cases.

Sometimes, it almost seemed
as though Brower were leading
the EC, or at least helping Jene-
vein, and he has put his
previous EC experience to good
use both in open meetings and
in committees.

If Brower wants a Big Three
position next year, he certainly
would be a deserving candidate.

 

COLE DAWSON

 

Jumior representative

Cole Dawson

Junior class representative
Cole Dawson has devoted
almost the entire year thus far
to chairing the open exam sub-
committee and has done a
remarkable job of resolving the
various conflicts and pounding
out a workable proposal.

Dawson has worked effective-
ly to iron out the problems the
Commerce School had with the
open exam policy — problems
that prevented a similar pro-
posal from getting anywhere
last year.

Dawson also has remained
patient in dealing with the
quirks of the faculty and the
Faculty Executive Committee
(which was unable to obtain a
quorum the day it was supposed
to vote on the proposal last
week ).

Dawson has parlayed the ex-
perience he gained as a fresh-
man class representative two
years ago into a position as one
of the more respected EC
members.

His value to this EC also
stems from the fact that he is
one of the student represen-
tatives to the faculty EC, where
nearly all important faculty
decisions originate. Dawson has
kept the rest of the student EC
informed of what the faculty is
doing.

Dawson has made few sug-
gestions outside of his work
with the open exams, but he
usually contributes to most
discussions. Dawson certainly
could be a potential candidate
for a higher position next year.

 

JIM GREEN
Semior law rep
Jim Green

While upperclass law
representative Jim Green’s
performance in honor situations
and subcommittee delibera-
tions may be worthwhile (he did
serve on the finance subcom-
mittee), his contributions to the
open EC meetings sometimes
have been meaningless.

You have to give this much to
Green: He’s not afraid to speak
his mind:

— ‘I’m not sure what it’s
tried to do,’’ he said about the
Political Review. '

— ‘I’m wondering if we can
afford a Frisbee Club at all.”’

— ‘Well. That’s nice... think
we ran out of money the first
time,” he said when the
Political Review asked the EC
for an additional $500 for a se-
cond issue.

— ‘‘We applaud John D. Wil-
son as president of this univer-
sity...a gifted and conscientious
administrator...,’’ Green wrote
in a letter trying to quelch
rumors flying around campus.

Green, apparently a fiscal
conservative, also voted to pay
students to man the polls during
EC elections.

As many law students are
wont to do, Green will cite
volume and verse of the law
code during EC meetings, even
if it doesn’t apply.

Representing the law stu-
dents has been Green’s only ap-
parent strong point. He suc-
ceeded in having the finance
subcommittee’s recommenda-
tion for the Student Bar
Association, $17,907, raised to
$18,354.67. And he made the mo-
tion to rescind the requirement
that upperclass law students
sign their honor cards in order
to vote in EC elections.

Still, the major responsibility
of the upperclass law represen-
tative should be to bridge the
gap between the law school and
the undergraduate campus.
Few moves have been made
toward bridging that gap this
year.

Perhaps Green’s’ most
notable accomplishment was
his receipt, by a unanimous
vote of the EC, of the ‘First An-
nual Wounded Beached Whale
Award.”’

in elections, several law
students showed up during the
EC meeting to complain.
Eleven EC members backed
the original policy; one,
Caruthers, suggested that the
EC rescind its earlier actions,
only to be told off by Jenevein.
The following week the EC,
faced with an onslaught of law
school protest, did indeed re-
scind the honor card require-
ment by a unanimous vote.
Caruthers always has ex-
pressed his opinions, no matter
how much he disagrees with
other members. He questioned
the need to man polls at all dur-
ing elections. (‘‘The freshmen
are kind of in the dark about
why there needs to be people
manning them’), and said
about the pavilion, “I’d like a
building we could grow into.”’
When the plus/minus poll was
taken, Caruthers lobbied for the
freshmen to be_ included.
Although unsuccessful, his ef-
forts showed that he has looked
out for the wishes of his class,
as well as for the entire school.

Freshman law rep
Steve Grist

Perhaps the most difficult
job, in terms of representation,
on the EC is that of the first-
year law representative. The
reason is that this person is not
elected until almost two months
after law school classes begin
and thus doesn’t have a whole
lot of time to accomplish much.

Steve Grist, this year’s first-
year law representative, has
done a little better job than his
predecessors and generally has
stood up for the rights of the law
students, even in such seeming-

On a vote to sponsor last mon-

wished), Grist abstained. Even

Messer also still is fighting
the Lexington bureaucracy
over the seemingly eternal pro-

Messer and James White serve
on the “Lexington Lighting and
Public Safety Committee,”
which is attempting to resolve
the problem.

Messer served on the finance
subcommittee that reviewed
budget requests at the begin-
ning of the year and made
recommendations to the entire
EC.

However, he has, on occasion,
adopted seemingly hypocritical
stances on various issues. For
example, during debate over
whether drug dealing should be
considered an honor violation,
Messer said, ‘‘I’d love to be able
to do it, but I think we’re going
to get in trouble trying to do it.”

He voted for the measure,
though.

Senior representative
George Youmans

Senior class representative
George Youmans is one of the
quietest members of this year’s
EC.

Youmans’ contributions to
discussions rarely range much
further than to agree with a
point someone else has already
made, and he rarely introduces
any new items for discussion.

Youmans did serve on the
open exam subcommittee with
Cole Dawson and presumably
helped with that proposal.

When the Independent Union
appeared before the EC to re-

quest student tax funds,

Youmans quickly suggested
that the IU should charge dues,
perhaps five dollars per mem-
ber, before coming to the EC for
money.

He was one of the few people
on the EC who questioned the
necessity of having the Student
Association for Black Unity
spend its funds like it had told
the EC the funds would be used.

_ Youmans said he didn’t see

anything wrong with shifting
funds from the SABU Ball to a
speaker, an intellectual event.

Sophomore. representative

James White

For a first-time EC mem-
ber, sophomore representative
James White has been effective
and seems genuinely concerned
for the interests of the Washing-
ton and Lee student body as a
whole.

White lost perhaps his biggest
battle of the year, even though
he had the support of EC Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein. White
orignially proposed that the EC
pay students to man the polls
during EC elections after the
returns from the freshman
class elections had to be
discarded and the election held
again.

‘‘We need some kind of incen-
tive to get people out there,”
White said.

White backed his proposal

‘through two. EC meetings

before losing on a 9-3 vote.

White himself manned the
polls during the coeducation
poll last month. He was in
charge of developing the ques-
tions, obtaining people to man
the polls and tabulating the
results. The turnout of nearly 60
percent is a tribute to his ef-
forts.

When the issue of what to do
about various rumors flying
around campus came up, a sug-
gestion was made at the EC
meeting to draft a statement
supporting President Wilson.
White wasn’t so sure that should
be done, though, and he said,
“Are you sure you’re represen-
ting the whole student body
when we say this?”’

Sophomore. representative
Ken Lindeman

Sophomore representative
Ken Lindeman has_ been
another relatively quiet
member of this year’s EC.

His most important duty was
the writing of a letter to The
Ring-tum Phi concerning noise
and food in the library, and
even then he had to be cajoled
into writing the letter.

However, Lindeman general-
ly does participate in discus-
sions, even if he rarely offers
any new ideas or brings any
complaints or problems before
the EC.

Lindeman missed two crucial
meetings within the past few
weeks. He was absent Jan. 23,
when the EC made its necktie
decision and he also missed two
special meetings, the Jan. 26
meeting to approve the open ex-
am policy and the Jan. 31
meeting to discuss the proposed
student activities building.

When ad hoc reports were
presented a few weeks ago,
Lindeman, an ad hoc member
of the Student Bar Association
said he had yet to be contacted

about a meeting. Perhaps he
needs to be a little more ag-
gressive both during regular
meetings and in other situations
in order to be a completely ef-
fective representative.

Artist describes her influences

By SCOTT PRYSI
Staff Reporter

Ann Glover of Roanoke, Va.,
is currently exhibiting a collec-
tion of her most recent water-
color and oil paintings in du-
Pont Gallery. She graduated
from Mary Baldwin College in
1972 with a degree in studio art
and has recently taught pain-
ting at the Roanoke Museum of
Fine Arts and Virginia Western
Community College. Her work
has been included in over 20
group exhibits and six solo
shows since 1978. Nearly all of
the paintings in this exhibit
depict her impressionistic inter-
pretation of a landscape similar
to Goshen near Arcadia, just
south of Lexington.

A few hours before the recep-
tion in duPont Gallery last Fri-
day, which officially opened her
show, she discussed her back-
ground, artistic influences and
method of painting.

Q. When did you first begin
painting?

A. With oil paints, at Mary
Baldwin, about 1969. I was do-
ing full-length portraits there. I
did not, to my surprise, become
a painter immediately after
graduation. I worked in
Charlottesville for two years as
a short-order cook, then went
into advertising as a graphic
designer. I finally began to
paint nearly full-time in 1978.

Q. When were the works in
this show done?

A. Most of the watercolor
sketches and oil painting of Ar-
cadia were done this past sum-
mer and fall. The four interior
still-lifes were done earlier,
sometime in the spring of last
year.

Q. On the average, how long
did the paintings in this show
take to complete?

A. The watercolors took about
two days. The oils took from a
week to eight or nine months.
That’s not working every day
but just looking at it and coming
back to it many times.

Q. How are working in oils
and working in watercolors dif-
ferent?

A. The logistics of each kind
of painting are different. The
watercolors are done on a flat
drawing board with all the col-
ors within a square-foot area,
literally. It’s much less of an
athletic event than working
with oils which require a great
deal of movement and mixing of
colors. The smell is very dif-
ferent also.

Q. There seems to be a
chromatic link between all the
paintings in this show. There is
an aqua-blue in almost every
work. Did you purposely do
this?

A. No. I think it’s a color I
need to see right now. It’s not
like a favorite color, but one I
need to use. For a while I had to
see red and black. It probably
will disappear.

Q. When I go out to Goshen
and look at scenes like what you
are depicting, I don’t see these
brilliant colors. Is this what you
actually see or do you add color
to enhance the painting?

A. There are interpretations
of what I see. I take liberties
with the colors I see. Since I
have the license and the choice
to change the colors slightly, to
intensify them, I do that. But I
try to allow the natural color to
give me the suggestion.

Q. Why do you paint?

A. I identified with the
picture-making works in the se-
cond grade. And early that was
an escape from uncomfortable
situations — from math class to
any social situation which to me
was overwhelming. I share that
with a lot of people who enjoy
things that involve solitude
—like writing music. By
temperament I was suited to
solitary pursuit. I want to make
some record of the awesome
things I see around me
—whether it’s in a fish-bowl or
in dishes in the sink or on a win-
dowsill. It involves a personal
interpretation. That, I feel, is
my job.

Q. Everyone who walks into
the Gallery certainly has come
reaction to your work. Do you
want people to like it?

A. Since my work is about a
place I think is awesome or
wonderful in terms of visuals
and evidence of something
magnificent, I try tomake some
approximation of it and always
fall short. I will always fall
short and feel frustrated. They
are pleasing to me. The best
thing that could happen would
be for someone to see my work,
then look at a place similar to
Arcadia with more clarity and
meaning. I don’t want to flatter
the place or just please people
but I want to clarify and
simplify an enormously com-
plex scene.

Q. You use photographs to
complete some of the paintings
you do. How do they influence
your work?

   

$9.13

 
 

Long Necks

   

A. I need them for the large
shapes. For an oil painting I
spend quite a while just looking
at the landscape. I make
sketches in pencil and water-
color and take photographs of
the area. Back in my studio I
refer to the photographs to
check on details and general,
larger forms. I don’t use them
as a color guide.

Q. What direction do you see
your painting taking?

A. I want to take several of
my paintings and blow them up
to a very large scale — about
the size of an entire wall — us-
ing pieces of cut paper of
various colors. That’s
something I want to work with
soon.

Q. Why?

A. I want to simplify the
shapes and colors in work I’ve
already done. Two or three
shades of a color will become
one.

Glover is strongly influenced
by 19th century Impressionism
and particularly the work of
Mary Cassat. Her fascination
with light and color keenly

shapes her paintings, which are |

dominated by subtle, natural
shapes and an impressive range
of brilliant colors. Her work will
remain on display in duPont
through Feb. 24.

 

 

‘Angel’ defiles

the silver screen

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

As a rule films usually come
under one of three headings
here in Lexington; Foreign,
First Run, and B movies. I per-
sonally refuse to relegate the
movie Angel, to any one of these
three catagories for fear of tain-
ting the good name of show bus-
iness. No, Angel, is in a class by
itself. (F-, perhaps).

Never has the silver screen
been so defiled by such sopho-
moric dialogue, moronic plot or
cliched setting. But what sets
this movie apart as a classic in
garbage is the mindbending
cast of characters.

For example, the villian is no
less than a_ schizophrenic-
necrophiliac with an Oedipus
Complex who sucks raw eggs
(with shell), pumps cinder
blocks for jollies, washes with
Ajax and kills hookers while
doubling as a Hare Krishna.
They didn’t show him eating his
buggers, but I bet he does.
Anyway, they just don’t come
any better than this guy.

The heroine is your basic high
school honor student turned

hooker by night. This role is
toughingly played by newcomer
Donna Wilkes (smart money
says she’s the new Dorothy
Stratten). The supporting cast
includes a transvestite with a
heart of gold, a dyke who makes
Wendy O. Williams look like the
Ivory Soap baby, an octogener-
ian Kit Carson impersonator
who is rumored to have a hot
iron in his pants, and a black
who is portrayed as being so
dumb that the NAACP should
file suit. There is one straight
guy, Hollywood Cop Anderson,
whose brilliant detective work
leaves Angel no other choice
than to avenge her cohort’s
deaths with a .357 Magnum.

I’m chomping at the bit to rail
on the final scene, but such a
classic piece of celluloid has to
be seen to be appreciated
(believed? ).

My recommendation to the
W&L moviegoer: by all means
go see it. It will make you feel
like Einstein himself compared
to the guys who made this farce.
Haggling, however, is required
at the box office because high-
way robbery is illegal, even in
Lexington.

 

 

‘The Cottage’ portrays incarcerated life
by using realism and improvisation

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“If you put anyone behind
bars, they act like animals,”’
said Ted Petrides, whose play
“The Cottage,’’ was presented
at the Boiler Room Theatre this
week. The one-act play centers
on the initiation of a new inmate
to the social hierarchy of a
juvenile detention center.
Petrides describes his work as a
“living script. We add stuff
every night, and that’s part of
the whole process.”

This week’s production is just
one step in the writing of the
play, according to Petrides.

‘“‘What happened was I wrote
the play once, turned it in think-
ing I had finished it, and my
professors kind of panned it,”
he said. ‘‘They thought the plot
was contrived, and the story
was kind of boring. They said,
‘Let’s improvise it.’ ” He then
had actors perform improvisa-
tional exercises based on situa-
tions in the original script.

“These gave me a much bet-
ter feel for it. My biggest pro-
blem was natural dialogue: just
setting the words down on
paper. I had done all my re-
search, I knew what I was try-
ing to say, I was just having
problems accomplishing it,”’ he
added.

Each actor was given a
character in the detention
center and told to play certain
objectives, which Petrides
observed and used in his final

script.

‘We would say, ‘Gus, I want
you to go to George’s locker and
take his brownies. Your goal is
to eat as many of the brownies
you can and have no one get
upset at you.’ That would force
that actor to use the manipula-
tive qualities that his character
has. In this way we developed
the characters as well as the
situation,” he said.

Petrides said this improvisa-
tional process has been used in
writing such works as “A
Chorus Line,’’ ‘‘Nicholas
Nickleby” and ‘‘Hair.”’ ‘‘It’s an
old process but one that hasn’t
been used at W&L for a while,”’
he added.

Petrides originally intended
to major in sociology at
Washington and Lee. He draws
heavily on his background in
that discipline in the writing of
“The Cottage.”

“As a writer, social problems
are very good topics to write
about. I need to care about
something, and I feel I need to
teach people something,” he
said.

He was inspired to write
about detention centers after a
friend who worked at one told
him it might be a good subject
for a play. As part of his
research he spent several days
observing young people at the
Natural Bridge Learning
Center, which he describes as
“one of the best in Virginia,’
and visited juvenile homes in
Philadelphia. ‘‘I’ve had people
tell me, ‘Anything you write in-

to the play could actually hap-
pen,’ they’re so bad,’’ he said.

“There are several different
ways a student can be exploited
or victimized in these places,”
he added. ‘‘Other inmates do
things to alienate a newcomer
and put him on the low end of
the inmate subculture. In our
play the central character is
Vanny, who’s a naive, pretty
nice kid when he came in.
Rather than using other types of
corrective measures, his father
recommends that he be placed
in one of these homes, and by
the end of the play he is doing
bad things and has become a lot
more of a jerk.”’

Petrides uses Danny to
demonstrate a phenomenon
known as “labeling.” ‘Once
you’ve been given so many
labels and called so many bad
things, like ‘troublemaker’ or
‘burn-out’ by the end of the day
you begin to believe what
they’re saying about you,” he
said.

After this production'is over,
Petrides plans to sit down and
write the finished product,
which he will turn in for his
senior thesis. Although ‘The
Cottage”’ is a one-act, he hopes
the final version to be a full-
length play.

The actors Petrides has been
working with are David Marsh,
Chris Carmouche, Blake
O’Neill, Ned Richardson and
Turner Friedman, all of whom
are sophomores. Senior Bob
Ferguson directed the produc-
tion.

Cagers upset Bridgewater

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
basketball team continued its
streak of inconsistency this
week.

The Generals crushed Emory
& Henry on Thursday night, lost
on Saturday night to a Lynch-
burg team it had already
defeated earlier in the season,
and defeated on Tuesday night
a Bridgewater team it had

game for senior co-captains
John Lee Graves and Chris
Baldwin.

The team rose to the occasion
by breezing past the Eagles,
who had defeated W&L 64-53 on
Jan. 14.

Graves turned in another
stellar performance, scoring 26
points — including two on a
slam-dunk that brought the
crowd to its feet — and grab-
bing 10 rebounds.

Graves now has 1,350 career
points at W&L, putting him
eighth on the all-time list. He
passed Brian Hanson Tuesday
night, who graduated last year
with 1,338 points.

Head coach Verne Canfield
could not recall the last time
—if there ever was a first time
—that Graves had dunked.

‘You could almost see it com-

ing from halfcourt,”’ said Can-
field. “I think there was a lot of
adrenalin built up for that
play. ”

Baldwin scored six points and
had six assists while running
W&L’s offense. Junior forward
Scott Shannon added 16 points
on eight-for-11 shooting.

The Generals dominated the
team statistics, outrebounding
the Eagles 34-26, outshooting
them from the floor 60 percent
to 49 percent, and outshooting
them from the free throw line 91
‘percent to 56 percent. The
Generals made 23 free throws in
a row during the game,
finishing 30 of 33 from the line.

W&L was never in any real
trouble after taking a halftime
lead of 38-25. Down 17-14 after
seven minutes of play, the
Generals went on a 10-0 streak

to lead 24-17 four minutes later.
Their lead didn’t fall below five
for the rest of the game.

The Jeckyll-and-Hyde
Generals met Lynchburg on
Saturday night in Warner
Center, two weeks after W&L
defeated the Hornets in Lynch-
burg 46-45.

The usually poor free-throw
shooting Hornets shot 21 of 25
from the line while winning
67-59,

Graves again led the Gener-
als, who were 43 percent from
the floor, with 17 points and 10
rebounds.

On Thursday night the
Generals traveled to Emory &
Henry College and came away
with a 74-62 victory.

The Generals shot 67 percent
from the floor and were led by
Graves’ 26 points and Bride-
weser’s six rebounds.

Canfield is hoping to complete
the regular season without los-
ing the Generals’ hold on third
place in the ODAC.

spring athletic teams will be
taking a different sort of break.

The Generals’ baseball and
lacrosse teams will be making
their annual trips to Florida
over the Washington holiday for
a week of practicing and what
both baseball coach Jim Mur-
dock and lacrosse coach Dennis
Daly termed a “coming to-
gether as a team.”

Both teams have worked to
pay the expenses for their trips
south. “Our kids take a lot of
pride in the fact that ‘we work-
ed hard to come here and we’re
going to put it to good use,’ ”
Murdock said of his players.

This year’s trip will be Mur-
dock’s third as the Generals’
coach, and he feels they have
been a large contributing factor
to the team’s play during the
regular season.

“I think a great deal of our
success can be attributed to
Florida. In the past, our first
time outside would be for an ac-
tual game. Now, we can work

on things, and if they make a
mistake, they learn from it, but
there’s no pressure. It builds a
very positive attitude,’ Mur-
dock said.

The baseball squad will have
two practice sessions a day, an
early morning run everyday,
and the opportunity for night
practice sessions. In addition,
on Friday they will play in a
double-header against Eckerd
College. The team will have at
least two free days in Sarasota,
as well as having most of the
evenings off.

Head lax coach Daly, in his
year at the Generals’ helm, sees
three objectives for the team’s
trip to Fort Lauderdale. One is
to gain a sense of team unity,
another is to return from
Florida as better lacrosse
players, and the third is to have
fun.

“Tt expect to accomplish all
three,” Daly said.

The Generals will hold double
practice sessions daily and
scrimmage against various
club teams in the Fort Lauder-
dale area. The club teams are
composed of many ex-college
players, Daly said.

Daly agreed with Murdock
that a major benefit of the trip
would be the weather. “We
can’t stand and teach and go
over things up here because the
guys are just freezing. For that
reason, Florida gives us a
chance to really concentrate
solely on lacrosse. It‘s worth at
least two weeks if not three
weeks of practice up here,’’ he
said.

Daly probably best summed
up the real worth of the break in
this way, “This is one of the
times that the team is really at
the focus, where everyone is
thinking along the same guide-
lines, everyone has the same
frame of reference.

“It really allows a team to get
to know each other, which I
think is a definite plus.”’

..AS we head home for a
deserved rest, here are some
Olympic thoughts on the
festival in Sarajevo. I’m begin-
ning to wonder if the Olympics
mean that special something
anymore. Four year’s ago, I
could think of nothing else but
flicking on the talking heads
box and spending umpteen
hours viewing everything from
the biathlon to an update on the
transportation problem in Lake
Placid. This go-round, I’m still
willing to do that, but that ex-
citement seems gone. With the
U.S. and Canada screaming
“Injustice! ’’ about each other’s
hockey teams, various and sun-
dry skiers from tiny European
countries being banned from
the competition, and everything
from instant soup to designer
clothes (Yes, you the American
people can vote for the U.S.A.
wardrobe) being plugged as of-
fical contributors to ‘‘our Olym-
pic effort,”’) the whole concept
seems a bit overdone, leaving
me with more than just your
average bad aftertaste. Does
anybody care to remember
what the Olympics is all about?
Or is it that they’re not willing
to speak up for fear of being
laughed at by those “‘real com-

Grapplers finish with four wins,

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team closed out its
regular season with four wins
last week, raising its record to
12-2, its best record in ten years.

Jeff Dixon finished the
regular season with a perfect
record of 19-0, making him the
first W&L wrestler to ac-
complish that feat. Dixon also
established a new W&L mark
for the fastest pin by taking only
10 seconds to defeat his oppo-
nent from Furman.

“I cannot say enough about
what Jeff has meant to this

team, both on and off the mat,”’
said head coach Gary Franke.
“His record is testimony of his
hard work, determination and
his ability. He was also a leader
who helped everyone on the
team this year.’

The Generals defeated
Longwood 33-18 on Wednesday
and won the W&L Quadrangu-
lar meet in a laugher, beating
Lynchburg, 42-11, Furman 540
and LaSalle 37-14.

For the season, six W&L
grapplers with 15 or more deci-
sions have winning records. The
team finished first in the W&L
College Invitational meet and
fourth in the W&L Invitational.

head to Eastern Regionals

The Generals were undefeated
at home, and outpointed their
opponents by a total of 449-163.

“It was a very satisfying
regular season and a very good
week for us,” said Franke. “We
had a lot of wrestlers perform
well, and I feel that we are
peaking at the right time. We
have the Eastern regional
(NCAA Division III at Trenton,
N.J., on Feb. 10-11) coming up
and I hope we continue to do
well.”’

Franke now has 85 career vic-
tories in his 11 years as wres-
tling coach at W&L, making
him the most successful wrestl-
ing coach in the school’s
history.

Booster Club loaned $100

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Ex-
ecutive Committee has given a
$100 loan to a group of Universi-
ty students interested in form-
ing a Booster Club. Heading the
group is Ed Buttarazzi, a junior
from Auburn, N.Y., who has
promised to pay back the loan
by March 5.

“It’s important to know that
we didn’t allocate any money,”’

said Executive Committee
President Robert Jenevein, who
said that the loan will be used on
a mailing to alumni.

The purpose of the mailing
would be to find out about the
former Assimilation Commit-
tee, which according to a recent
‘Washington Post’’ article
(Jan. 31, 1984) ‘‘disciplined
students who walked on the
grass, failed to greet fellow
students, or were caught
without a necktie,” Jenevein

America” Tuesday, but said,
‘““My feeling and the feeling of
this committee is that further
publicity in this light is
something the students don’t
want. As it stands now, I won’t
do that.

“It’s technically my decision,
and I’m asking the committee
to help me decide...I would not
go under any circumstances if
this school would not benefit.’’

No action was taken on
Pockrass’ petition, but Jene-
vein did not appear on the pro-
gram.

In other action this week: the
EC took less than three minutes
to approve four minor changes
to the open exam proposal,
which now awaits action by the
Faculty Executive Committee

and the faculty as a whole. The
entire faculty is expected to
discuss the issue at its March 5
meeting, and if the proposal is
approved then, it would go into

effect for this semester’s ex-
ams.

Monday’s regular meeting
was postponed until Tuesday
afternoon, at which time the EC
approved the student adviser

system 11-1, with freshman law
representative Steve Grist op-
posed.

Selected by the EC, student

advisers would advise other ~

students on course and pro-

fessor selection. Each student
adviser would specialize in his
major.

said that Buttarazzi’s group
merely wants to find out
what made the Assimilation
Committee and its policies a
source of pride to the students,
was quoted in the Post article as
saying, ‘“‘We have no intention _

of going back to an Assimilation
Committee.”

Jenevein does not feel that the
Booster Club would try to in-
stitute an Assimilation Commit-
tee. ‘‘There’s no way anybody
would try that. I think the
Assimilation Committee is out
‘of date here.”’

According to Jenevein, the
Booster Club advocates ap-
proached the EC once they saw
the Committee’s concern about
student apathy. Regardless of
what the Boosters do, Jenevein
has certain goals that he would
like to see met.

These include some way for
all of the students to learn ‘‘The
Washington and Lee Swing,”
the University’s fight song. He
would like to see students take
more pride in W&L’s traditions
and the school’s namesake,
General Robert E. Lee, as well
as gain an understanding of Lee
and his personal history.

“T’d like to see more people
attending athletic events,”’ said
Jenevein, yet what makes all of
this difficult is the fact that
pride must come willingly from
the student body. ‘“‘You can’t
force anyone to have school
spirit,’’ he said.

Trustees

(continued from page 1)

The trustees and their wives,
along with some University ad-
ministrators and the Dean

banquet in Evans Dining Hall.

President Wilson introduced
three of the trustees who were
just beginning their terms:
James F. Gallivan of Nashville,
Frances A. Lewis of Richmond
and Charles S. Rowe of
Fredericksburg.

 

Tom Wolfe of New York City,
the fourth trustee to join the
Board at this time, had an
engagement scheduled prior to
his election to the Board.

University Secretary James
W. Whitehead said that 22 of the
trustees attended the meeting.

Edgar J. Shannon Jr. of
Charlottesville and Frank G.
Young of Fort Worth were
unable to attend. Wolfe will at-
tend his first meeting on May
25-26.
