One-week break

The faculty calendar commit-

plan that was approved.

The committee also sup-
ported its earlier decisions
recommending continuation of
the 12-12-6 calendar and exten-
sion of classes from 50 to 55
minutes. A recommendation
that students register for all of
their following year’s courses in
the spring of the preceding year
was Clarified, Feldman said.
The committee voted ‘‘to
recommend to the faculty that

tee will recommend a one-week
October vacation as a substitute
for Thanksgiving vacation to
President John D. Wilson next
month.

After rejecting a proposal for
a two-day vacation in the mid-
dle of October and a three-day
vacation over Thanksgiving by
a 3-6 vote, the committee Fri-
day supported its original deci-
sion for an October vacation by
a 6-2 vote, with one abstention.

Student representative Lee
Feldman said he and Rob

they look into ways to relieve
the burden of registration,’’ he
added.

Saying the committee ‘‘waf-
fled’”’ on the issue of the
Thanksgiving vacation, Dr.
John Wise, chairman, added
that no formal recommendation
will be made to Wilson regard-
ing Thanksgiving break, but
that the October break is view-
ed as a ‘‘substitute’’ for it.

$15,000 Contact fund shortage goes unnoticed

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Contact, the student organization that
brings speakers to campus, has a section
on its budget reports titled ‘‘funds dispers-
ed,’’ which is perhaps more appropriate
than the term that is presumably meant,
‘funds disbursed.”’

University records show the organiza-
tion ran a deficit of nearly $10,000 last
year, at the same time that Contact’s own
accounting showed a $950 surplus for the
year.

That deficit, added to the nearly $6,000
negative balance that the University show-
ed Contact began last year with, put this
year’s organization more than $15,000 in
the red before the year even started.

,pparently no University or Contact of

ials were aware of the shortfall until last

hen Contact co-chairmen Marty

ttamn

withdraw non-existent funds from the
group’s University account.

‘They have come up short,” University
Treasurer E. Stewart Epley said.

‘I don’t know what the explanation is.”’
Founded in 1965, Contact is funded by stu-
dent body taxes, by the Interfraternity
Council and by individual contributions.
The IFC has appropriated $7,500 for the
organization for the last two years. In ad-
dition, the EC contributed $8,500 in student
taxes last year and $9,400 this year.

The final budget report prepared by Con-
tact 83 (as the 1982-83 group was known)
showed that it spent $19,996.54 while taking
in $20,958.38, putting the organization
$961.84 in the black. According to Universi-
ty accounting, however, Contact °83
started the year with a deficit balance of
$5,789.71 which had been carried forward
from bese previous vear’s $ organization

no the ney me 31} ng \ veal

expenditures of $25,592.40 on revenues of
$16,075, a difference of $9,517.40.

“This was a very expensive year,’’ said
assistant University treasurer Vernon
Snyder, who handles student body ac-
counts.

Therefore, although Harmon and Slahor
did not realize it until late February, ac-
cording to University books the $16,900 in
funding they began the year with was
credited against a deficit balance of
$15,307.11, leaving them only $1,592.89 in
effective operating funds.

According to its Dec. 6 budget report to
the EC, the group spent close to that
amount just on the solicitation letter which
was sent to parents last fall

The deficit, had anyone noticed it, looked
smaller on paper than it actually was,

ecause the $7,500 IFC appropriation in-

i¢
i

deposited in April and credited to Contact
83.

Outgoing IFC President on Ellinger
explained that the organization does its
budgeting and appropriation in the winter,
just before the new officers begin their
terms.

‘‘We’ve just given Contact the money
and haven't watched over it,”’ Ellinger
said.

Because they have differing categories
for disbursements, line-by-line com-
parison of University and Contact reports
is impossible.

In addition, Contact maintains a check-
ing account of its own at United Virginia
Bank. Transactions involving that account
are reflected in reports prepared by the
student organization, but do not appear on

Review and Outlook
Priorities

This week in the Executive Committee meeting
minutes, in a slot always used to list its absent
members, the committee complimented us by mark-
ing us absent as though we were a member.

We cannot sufficiently express our gratitude.

In addition, a rumor has been quickly spread that
we are “boycotting” its meetings out of some
unknown reason, a perception that seems to have
been born and bred in the EC’s office.

These occurrences create in us a feeling of ap-
prehension. In a year of over 25 meetings so far, The
Ring-tum Phi has missed one, an attendance record
better than some of the committee’s own members.

As we are not required to attend each of its gather-
ings or include EC news in our weekly coverage, the
EC’s action strikes us as a bit presumptuous.

The Ring-tum Phi cannot cover all the news that
takes place every week. We must then make judg-
ments as to what we will include in our pages. The EC
is no exception in our decision-making process.
Nothing can receive automatic coverage.

As the authority over almost all of the student
_organizations on campus, the Executive Committee
plays a large part in the news picture of the W&L
campus. Indeed it is often rightfully the subject of
lead and front-page stories. When it takes notable ac-
tion, it is our job to report it and we are at fault when
we do not.

One might argue that the Phi must cover every mo-
tion, vote and budget report so that concerned stu-
dents can then participate in their student govern-
ment. For such complete detail, the EC produces ex-
tensive minutes after every meeting and posts them
on campus bulletin boards.

We hope then that the EC members realize that
they are competing with such demanding issues as
coeducation, the Mock Convention and the special
grand jury as well as other important stories that ap-
pear each week, and that they will show a little bit
more understanding of news judgment in the future.

Students discuss SNu incident

White replies

To the Editors:

I would like to clarify some of
the misconceptions about my
involvement in the SNu inci-
dent. Please refer to last week’s
article, “SNu Decides to Drop
Issue,”’ for details of the facts.

First of all, my involvement
was minor in that I only
possessed the simulator.

Second, this gadget was sold
at a public exhibition as a novel-
ty item. Since it was sold to the
public, the question of its legali-
ty never entered my mind. In
retrospect, I should not have
had it in my possession, nor
should I have given it to anyone
else. I made a mistake, and I
am paying a stiff penalty for it.

Regarding the opinions ex-
pressed in last week’s Phi, I
hope the student body will not
consider a minor involverhent
in a childish prank to be worthy
of resignation. I would like to
think the students recognize the
positive contributions I have

made to this year’s Committee
and my continuing determina-
tion to represent the students
well.

If any ambiguities remain, I
earnestly hope the students will
contact me personally.

James White

EC leaders
support White.

To the Editors:

Although we do not condone
the possession of an artillery
simulator, we remind the stu-
dents that James White has con-
tributed effectively and

’ representatively to the Ex-

ecutive Committee this year.
Requests that he resign seem
ill-founded and inappropriate.
We encourage James to dismiss
such requests and rededicate
himself to another year of quali-
ty service.

Pyle’s view of North

To the Editors:

Mr. Pyle’s column in the
March 22 issue was undoubtedly
most offensive to the many
students here from Northern
states. I am sure that many of
them will take the opportunity
to reply to his hardly flattering
remarks about their homeland.

As a Westerner, I am not par-
ticularly concerned with the
relative merits of the North and
South. My concern, (and this
concern should be foremost
among the student body) is
that, judging from Mr. Pyle’s
own description of the event,
Washington and Lee was hor-

WLUR seeks

To the Editors:

When one ascends the heights
of Reid Hall to the WLUR
studios, one is assaulted by
signs reminding him that the
honor code applies fully to the
third floor and that it is an
honor violation to remove
records or equipment without
proper authorization.

By the end of last year and
through the Fall Term this
year, I thought that we had
finally driven this point home
and that the problem of records
‘walking away” had been sup-
planted by an awareness of the
honor code and what it entails.

After an exhaustive search, it
has been determined that at
least four albums are recently
missing from the WLUR record
library. These include the Foot-
loose soundtrack, 99 Luftballons
by Nena, Making Movies by
Dire Straits and Pictures at 11
by Robert Plant. Legally these
records are the property of the
record companies, not WLUR.
The radio station is responsible
for them while they are in our

ribly misrepresented at the
Model United Nations at
Princeton. It appears that, at
the very least, the delegation
sent by our University showed a
significant lack of tact. As an
example, the members of the
delegations should have recog-
nized that immaturely display-
ing the Confederate banner is
bound to elicit very negative
feelings among large segments
of the American population,
many of whom were assuredly
represented at Princeton that
weekend. I fear that
Washington and Lee has been
unfairly shown as a bastion of

lost albums

custody.

We do not know why these
albums are AWOL. We do not
know if someone on our staff
may be responsible, or if it may
be someone else. We would hate
to think that they have been
stolen on a campus which
prides itself on a tradition of
honorable conduct.

“We do not think it is too
much to ask for a student to ...
claim only that which is his.”
(Washington and Lee Universi-
ty White Book, page 1.)

Regardless of the circum-
stances surrounding the disap-
pearance, these records are
missing, of that we are sure.

If anyone has a copy of one of
these albums_ stamped
‘‘WLUR,”’ we appeal to this per-
son’s sense of honor to them-
selves and this community and
ask that the records be returned
in any manner the person
chooses, with no questions ask-
ed. Thank you.

comments

To the Editors:

I definitely think it is about
time that the incident between
Phi Delt and Sigma Nu a few
weeks back was laid to rest, but
first someone needs to respond
on behalf of Phi Delt.

Mr. St. Clair and Mr. Steil-
berg both referred to the inci-
dent in last week’s Phi as the
BOMBING of the Sigma Nu
house by members of Phi Delt.
I, personally, was under the im-
pression that the Iraqi’s were
bombing the Iranians and that
the Shiite Moslems were bomb-
ing Beirut. For some reason I
just don’t see one fraternity
bombing another. Notice, the
newly painted columns at 4
Henry St. are still standing; the
masonry still stands as a fairly
imposing structure; even the
dead hedges lining the yard still
surround the fortress. 0.K., I

In partial response to Mr.

North, may I say that in New

Do any of the men of W&L

EC backs SAB restructuring

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

An improved ability to offer
social activities will be the main
result of the Executive Commit-
tee’s recent approval of a plan
to decentralize the Student Ac-
tivities Board, according to the
two SAB officers who proposed
the change.

Vice-chairman Burford Smith
and treasurer John Haywood
said they welcome the EC’s
Monday night decision, which
will give next year’s SAB a
board of directors structure.

“I’m glad that the EC took the
action that they did,” said
Smith. “They saw that it was in
the best interests of the Student
Body to meet the problems
we've been having.” |

Under the reorganization
plan the SAB will be headed by
a chairman who will be assisted
by an executive director, a

Calendar proposal

should have that one day
(Thanksgiving Day) off. The
possibility was mentioned of
having that day off and making
up classes on the Saturday.”’

Although each of these pro-
posals was discussed, Wise
said, none was voted on.

Wise said members of the
committee cited two main
reasons for rejecting the two-
day vacation in October and the
three-day vacation over
Thanksgiving. ‘‘A partial break
very soon deteriorates into
students’ going (home) earlier
and coming back later that
eventually will extend (each
shorter break) to a week,” he
added.

Feldman, who was not at Fri-
day’s meeting but voted by pro-
xy, said he was disappointed
with the committee’s decision
to substitute the one-week Oc-

treasurer and a secretary. One
member of a newly formed
Board of Directors will be
assigned to coordinate work in
each of the six areas of SAB ac-
tivity. These areas are enter-
tainment/bands, entertain-
ment/weekends, outing/recrea-
tion, films/special events,
publicity and operations.

“T think that the Student Body
is going to be surprised next
year by the number of activities
we can offer,’ Haywood re-
marked.

Haywood said that under the
present SAB structure the
group did not have enough peo-
ple to concentrate on certain
areas such as outings. The addi-
tional people will enable the
SAB to try new things and con-
centrate on areas that previous-
ly had been neglected, he add-
ed.

“We're pretty good at what
we do now,” said Smith, ‘‘but
we're limited in the things we

can try,’’ said Haywood
finishing the sentence.

Smith added that he hoped the
EC would appoint a subcom-
mittee to go over the SAB ap-
plications in the spring and
would consult with former SAB
members before making selec-
tions. Many new EC members
are not aware of the workings of
the SAB, he said.

“If competent people are ap-
pointed to the different posi-
tions, then any needs that the
Student Body has will be ac-
comodated. If the people ap-
pointed don’t work, then you
will have three or four people
doing all the work just like
now,” Smith said.

New officers for the SAB will
be appointed in the spring by
the EC. Freshmen, first-year
law students and anyone who
had a legitimate reason for not
applying in the spring can still
be appointed next fall, Smith
said.

tober vacation for the
Thanksgiving vacation.

“The mindset in the faculty
was that students would be tak-
ing two weeks off,” he said. ‘I
felt that could be greatly reduc-
ed if the professors assigned
work when (the students) were
supposed to be there.”’ The com-
mittee will report to President
Wilson within the next two
weeks, Wise said. Wilson can
then decide whether to pass the
report on to the whole faculty
for its approval. Faculty ap-
proval — which would be re-
quired for any changes to be
made — would follow action by
one or more standing faculty
committees and the University
Council.

An appendix to the commit-
tee’s report, Wise said, is

another proposal under which
the calendar would be split into
six-week segments, enabling

courses to vary from three

“The flexibility there does
seem to provide some interest-

Sen. Proxmire

to address Mock
Convention

U.S. Sen. William Proxmire,
D-Wisconsin, will deliver the
keynote address May 12 at the
1984 Washington and Lee Mock
Democratic Convention.

Proxmire has been in politics
since 1950, when he was elected
to the Wisconsin State Assem-
bly. In 1957 he was elected to the
U.S. Senate in a special election
to fill the seat left vacant by the
death of Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
He was re-elected the following
year to his first full six-year
term and again re-elected in
1964, 1970, 1976 and 1982.

Proxmire’s keynote speech,
Saturday morning, May 12, will
precede the nomination and roll
call voting process for president
and vice president.

 

Cappeto says stress
over jobs increasing

By STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Despite increased graduate
school openings and the best job
market in recent years, Associ-
ate Dean of Students Michael A.
Cappeto has noticed a sharp in-
crease in student anxiety about
what to do next year.

‘What I’ve noticed in talking
almost exclusively with seniors
is an awful lot of stress, much
more than in the past,” said
Cappeto, who has observed this
stress among underclassmen as
well. “I really don’t know why,”’
he said.

According to Cappeto, the
current job market is better
than it has been in the past five
or six years. Prospective em-
ployers who visit W&L are hir-
ing more people than they have
in the past. National reports in-
dicate more openings in
graduate schools and better
employment opportunities. The
economy has improved, and
unemployment is down.

“Graduate school is easier to
get into,’’ said Cappeto,
because fewer people are apply-
ing. He noted a high demand for
teachers, chemists and a host of
other professional people.

The situation is still very
stressful, however, ‘‘The
seniors have pretty much nar-
rowed down what they want to
do. You have to be _ thick-
skinned to enter the job market.
Its the same thing with
graduate school.”

Dean of Students Lewis John
has not noticed more students
coming to his office for counsel-
ing, but has observed a change
in why they are coming.

“I think there is more con-
cern among seniors about what
they will do next year,’’ said
John.

Neither University Chaplain
David Sprunt Sr. nor University
Psychologist James Worth has
noticed any change in the
number of students or their pro-
blems.

“I believe he (Cappeto) is
seeing more stress. At the same
time...I can’t say I’m seeing
students coming in with more

stress,”’ said Worth.

Both Worth and Cappeto feel,
however, that there is a mis-
perception about’ the
psychologist’s role as a
counselor.

“It’s simply a matter of label-
ing,’ said Cappeto. ‘Dr. Worth
is...labeled the psychologist.”

“The overwhelming majority
of things I talk about with
students are issues I faced when
I went to school,’ said Worth,
who sees about 130 students dur-
ing the course of the school
year.

Worth does believe the anxie-
ty in students noted by Cappeto
is real, and both he and Cappeto
have speculated about reasons
for this stress.

“‘T think it’s too early to say
there is a trend,’’ said Worth,
who feels the added stress may
be a reaction to change at W&L
or to past years’ economics.

“‘We’re in a period of reas-
sessment,”’ according to Worth.

Cappeto agreed, ‘‘Things are
moving and changing. Many un-
derclassmen are anxious about
that.’’

According to Cappeto and
Worth, the University does offer
a variety of services to students
who feel anxiety about the
future. ‘‘We offer more [place-
ment] services than 80 percent
of the schools our size,” said
Cappeto. ‘‘Seniors receive peri-
odical literature from me.”

‘‘Mike and I each have some-
thing to offer,” said Worth, who
wishes more students would
make appointments to see him
whenever they feel anxious or
depressed.

Cappeto is especially desirous
of seeing the perceived tension
lessened.

‘“‘Everyone’s so uptight about
what they’re going to do next
year. I would like to say,
‘Relax. Your senior year is sup-
posed to be a year to
remember,’ ”’ he said.

‘I’ve had two or three people
sit down in my office and cry,”
said Cappeto. ‘“‘Everywhere I
walk I see people who are very,
very concerned about next
year. I’ve never seen that
before.”’

come on, I once saw my own
mother break a pane of glass,
but, of course, that too was just
an accident, as was the break-
ing of Sigma Nu’s windows.
Capt. Ripple of the military
science department has de-
scribed this so-called bomb (ac-
tually an artillery simulator) as
a “large firecracker,’ and
James White has said that he
was unaware that the device
was dangerous. So, when Frank
Surface chunked the
‘firecracker’ into Sigma Nu’s
front yard it was hardly in an
attempt to BOMB our poor
neighbors. As a matter of fact,
it sounded like a fairly harmless
joke when I first heard about it.
Therefore, all of the members
of Phi Delt were very amazed
that the members of Sigma Nu
became so upset about the
whole affair. In order to ap-
pease them, we have stolidly
accepted our two weeks proba-
tion and $150 fine for our con-
nection with the firecracker.

So, let’s all drop the whole
matter and let everyone get on
with his respective business.
Phi Delt, White and Surface
have already had their names
undeservedly and repeatedly
dragged through the mud, and I
personally think it is time it was

It's tough, but the people who

pretentious to condemn an en-

on your warped “Southern”
beliefs. Everyone from the
North does not, as you might
like to believe, wear polyester
or AC-DC T-shirts or live near a
chemical plant. In fact, after
living in New Jersey for my en-
tire life, I must say that it has
been quite pleasant.

I come from a small city not
very unlike Lexington, except
in that there are no Nazi-like
“special grand juries’’ running
around handing out subpoenas
to people who they think might
use drugs. There are also many
fewer people who are as confor-
mist and cynical as yourself,
Mr. Pyle, and this may, in part,
account for the fact that
everyone in Northern schools
does not dress exactly alike.

In closing, I would like to add
that although I cannot account
for the routing of the interstate
highway system, perhaps the
reason the view is so ugly is to
keep people, such as yourself,
from ‘‘invading’’ our state any

more than is_ absolutely
necessary.

To the Editors:

In regard to Markham Shaw
Pyle’s recent report about his
adventures with the model
United Nations meeting, or
more appropriately his very
negative view of the environ-
ment in which it was held, I felt
the letter to be very detrimental

to the relations between North-

erners and Southerners at

W&L. This school prides itself _

on the harmonious relationship
between North and South, and
for a school that derives a large

percentage of its students from
the North, it cannot afford for
such a relationship to be
damaged. The letter Mr. Pyle
wrote only serves to underscore
his obvious old fashioned, close-
minded attitude, an attitude
that does not belong at a univer-
sity such as Washington and
Lee. One must feel regret that
Mr. Pyle felt he had to impose
his negative opinion at the ex-
pense of many fine students
from the Northern states. Most
students here have the sense to
recognize bad taste, all except
Lord Pyle.

As to Mr. Pyle’s thoughts
about fashion, he himself is no
candidate for G.Q. One must
bear in mind that his comments
may be out of embarrassment
at his faux-pas more than
anything else. Since Mr. Pyle
had not been north before, I feel
he is an unqualified candidate
to make such rash judgments
about the area.

In closing, may I point out
that while New Jersey and
Delaware produce more chemi-
cals than any other states,
without which this country
could not survive, they also
possess many natural regions of
beauty, something that Mr.
Pyle chose to ignore in his opi-
nionated evaluation. In the
future, I hope that Mr. Pyle will
keep his foot out of his mouth
and think before he speaks. His
letter brings to mind the old
adage ‘People in glass houses
shouldn’t throw stones.’

Long John’s comes up short

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter
Before reviewing Long John
Silver’s Seafood Shoppe, I
would like to clear my con-
science with an admission of
selfishness. What with a load of
term papers and exams in the
near future, and with professors

Eat Beat

ATALANTA I A TITERS TR
stubbornly continuing in their
underestimation of my academ-
ic performances (that’s what
you get for being too deep), I’ve
been a little frustrated of late.
So instead of attempting to il-
luminate some gem of a
restaraunt, as should be my
aim, I’ve opted out of spite to be
the one to hand out a bad grade.
Nevertheless, I believe. that
what follows is a fair review of
Long John Silver’s, and as com-
prehensive as one trip with one
stomach could be.

To get to Long John’s, get on
State Highway 60 heading out of
town, pass Wendy’s on your
right and KFC on your left
(‘‘Why did I keep going?”’), and
it’s to the right just after the
underpass.

One of my favorite things
about Long John’s is the en-
trance walkway, which re-
sembles a wharf (referred to by
northerners as a pier, or a

dock), with a thick ship-rope

railing. This reminds me of
home, but without the water.
Inside, Long John’s has the
national chain look; you order
at a counter, it’s clean; it’s
comfortable, the employees
wear uniforms, etc. On the wall
before you get to the counter

‘are pictures of the Long John

meals, and I imagine that it is
this visual effect which has a lot
to do with whatever degree of
success Long John Silver’s en-
joys. The pictures, like the food,

look. enticing. Seafood
—‘check’’ — crunchy-looking
—‘‘check’” — golden —
‘check’.

Last year, I went to Long
John’s several times, always
because the thought of crunchy,
golden-fried seafood overcame
that part of me which should
have remembered and known
better. Like any wise Pavlov
dog, I’ve learned.

But in the name of duty I
returned and ordered the
seafood platter, the clam din-
ner, an oyster, and a chicken
piece, so as to avoid missing a
possible house specialty. The
waitress who brought the meal
asked me if I always ate like
this.

That I was alive and relative-
ly zit free should’ve answered

the question, but I told her I’d

missed lunch.

With the seafood platter, you
get a piece of fish, two scallops,
a couple of shrimp, french fries,

hush puppies, cole slaw and a

    

bed of krumblies.

Easily the nastiest thing on
the plate is the fried fish;
though the fish itself might be of
good quality, it’s always better
to know what kind of fish you’re
eating. Seeing only ‘‘fried fish”’
as the description should make
you as suspicious as ‘‘fried
meat.’’ But what makes this
fish inexcusable is the fried
outer layer. The batter forms a
bright, crunchy glaze around
the fish, somehow keeping the
grease on the inside. After a bit,
you see that it glistens with
grease, makes the fish sticky,
and is so rich that it over-
whelms the fish. The flavor,
while unique, is ultimately just
Long-John-Slivery.

The scallops, as they are
cooked like the fish, taste very
much like the fish, equally
greasy.

The shrimp, though cooked
the same, are not as affected as
the fish and scallops, because
shrimp doesn’t soak grease like
fish and scallops. But the
shrimp is not real good either,
with the naked shrimp being

much smaller before it’s cooked -

than after.

The best thing on the plate is
the cole slaw. Though it’s basic
generic fast food cole slaw, it
sits out like a clean, fresh oasis
of nutrition on the plate. The
hush puppies and french fries
are filling at best.

The clam dinner, however,
was far better than the other
seafood. The clams come to the
store already breaded, in a dif-
ferent batter, so they’re spared
the Long John method. They’re
not at all greasy, the batter is
flaky, and the clams _ them-
selves are good and chewy. I ate
all the clams, which is more
than I can say for the platter.

The chicken piece wasn’t
greasy, but there was more
bread than chicken. If chicken’s

Kudos to the management at
the State theatre for having the
far-sightedness to schedule
Blame It On Rio during the
finals week. This hedonistic (as
well as chauvinistic) romp in
the sand is a sure cure for
whatever ails you during these

days of intellectual overachiev-
ment. The medicinal list of in-
gredients includes more T&A,
flesh, skin, etc. than should be
allowed to be screened in a town
supporting two all-male col-
leges, and a fantasy of a
screenplay that will delight
even the most grievous class-
room burnout victims.

 

Blame It On Rio is reminis-
cent of the old surf’s-up movies
of the early 60s with an 80s tem-
po and a big enough budget to
elevate it above the status of a B
movie. The selling point of this
movie, however, is not the plot
line, as is apparent five minutes
into the first reel. The star at-
tractions are the opulent
beaches of Rio de Janeiro (and
more importantly the wall-to-
wall nudity) and the bodacious
debut of actress Michelle
Johnson, whose “tubular per-

formance’’ will not soon be
forgotten (although I can’t
remember a word she said).

Michael Caine is superb as a
middle-aged man in mid-crisis.
Joseph Bologna is very convinc-
ing as Caine’s cohort and future
cardiac arrest candidate.
General Hospital’s Demi Moore
is attractive as Michelle’s
playmate and Valerie Harper
plays the role of a typical wife
who’s gone through one too
many sessions of hot-tub
psychotherapy.

The first hour and fifteen
minutes is a veritable highlight
film of Miss Johnson and a host
of other nubile young things.
Unfortunately the ending gets
bogged down in several amoral
plot twists that left me begging
for one more glimpse of Miss
Johnson’s anatomy, but to no
avail. It was an obvious plot
designed to necessitate multiple
viewings.

My strategy for the W&L
moviegoer reads as follows:
Schedule your exams on alter-
nating days starting Saturday.
Go see Blame It On Rio after
every exam. I guarantee that
for the hour and a half that you
are ensconced in the theater
you will be oblivious to the fact
that you just flagged your
Macro-economics final and
won’t graduate in May.

P.S. Eddie Curran’s contribu-
tions to this review were greatly
appreciated.

 

 

what you want, see volumes I &
II of The Beat.

I’m not a fan of fried oysters,
but I’ve enjoyed them more
than I enjoyed this one. It was
greasy, and after a bite it fell
out of its bread sac.

The most obnoxious part of
the Long John’s experience is
the bed of what they call
krumblies, upon which all the
seafood sits. They’re little crun-
chy pieces of fried batter and
are nothing but cholesterol
grease balls, with no pretense of
nutritional value. They are a fit-
ting symbol to the Long John’s
outlook: If it’s golden and crun-
chy, somebody out there will
eat it.

Usually I have this pride

thing about finishing everything
on my plate, but swallowed
pride doesn’t threaten to haunt
you later like Long John’s fish,
so the fish stayed behind, and I
went to take a shower.

For another side of the story,
here’s what fellow chow hound
Charlie Alcorn has to say: “‘I’ll
stick my neck out for Long John
Silver’s. I feel that the cuisine
there is of a quality that defies
description.’’ Maybe so, _ if
you’re hard up for seafood and
have an iron belly. But be warn-
ed, after you eat that fish, you
might end up running out of
there.

joys cakes, cookies, doughnuts

Baseball drops three
ODAC contests

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team’s hopes of win-
ning the ODAC title were dealt a
severe blow last week as the
Generals lost three conference
games.

W&L saw its record fall to 4-8
(1-5 in the ODAC). The Gen-
erals lost to Lynchburg 5-4
Thursday and dropped a
doubleheader with Randolph-
Macon, 4-3 and 7-4, at home on
Saturday.

Against Lynchburg, the
Generals never led. Trailing 5-2
entering the ninth inning, W&L
scored two runs in the inning
but was unable to tie the game
as a man was left stranded on
third at the end of the game.

W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said that his team ‘‘played
very well against Lynchburg
but had a couple of defensive
lapses that coust us the game.”

spotted Randolph-Macon an
early lead in both games of the
doubleheader and was unable to
make up the lost ground.

In the first game, R-MC
scored three runs in the first in-
ning against W&L starter Kirk
Breen.

The Generals battled back
and trailed 4-3 in the seventh in-
ning. The failure to produce the
crucial hit hurt W&L again as
the game ended with a General
runner on third base. Breen
(1-3) got the loss for the
Generals.

In the second game, the
Generals fell apart early in the
game as the Yellow Jackets
tagged freshman Jon Thornton
for four runs in the second in-
ning.

“We seem to put our game
together in one area, only to
have another area fall apart,”’
said Murdock. ‘When we hit’
our pitching lets us down, and
vice versa. The big innings
where we let our opponents
score three runs against us
also.”

“But we are not mentally
defeated,”’ Murdock added.
“Our attitude is still good and
we can still make a run for the
conference title.”’

Lax dumps Guilford

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

What a difference an after-
noon makes.

Washington and Lee head
lacrosse coach, who was
desperately looking for the little
things to start going his team’s
way, found relief with an im-
pressive 17-7 win over Guilford
yesterday afternoon in the mud
at Glen Maury Park, snapping a
four-game skid.

“They just went out there and
said, ‘Let’s doit,’ and they did. I
was really pleased. It’s a very
nice feeling,’’ Daly said.

The Generals, for the first
time since their opening win
against Virginia Tech, got an
early jump on their opponents,
racing to a 4-0 first quarter lead
from which they never looked
back.

W&L took a 7-4 lead at‘ the
half, and after the Quakers’
Tim Diamond scored with 5:23
gone in the third quarter, the
Generals got a pair of goals
from junior attack Rod San-

tomassimo and a third from
sophomore midfielder Steve
McGrath to end the quarter
with a 10-5 lead.

The Generals added seven
tallies in the final stanza, get-
ting two from sophomore G. T.
Corrigan and two from scoring
leader Lee Heimert, who had

five goals on the afternoon.

Reversing another pattern,
the dominant goaltender in this
game was in the Generals’ net
in the person of junior John
DiDuro. DiDuro turned away 17
shots, including an early first-
quarter Guilford breakaway at-
tempt that Daly saw as the
‘whole ball game.”’

“It made them think that we

. had Plexiglas in front of the net.

He was just great today,’’ Daly
said, emphasizing — that
DiDuro‘s early saves gave the

‘Generals the momentum that

carried them to the victory.

The Generals got fine offen-
sive performances from San-
tomassimo with four goals, one
assist and junior Jeff Mason
with three goals, one assist.

The Generals controlled the
game statistically, as_ well.
Senior Rich Schoenberg con-
tinued his dominance of the
faceoff, winning 20 of 27. The
Generals also picked up more
ground balls, were successful
on 94 per cent of their clears
while limiting Guilford to a 65
percent rate, and scored on
nearly half of their shots while
the Quakers were on target with
less than one fifth of their at-
tempts.

Daly was quick to praise the
Quakers, however. ‘‘If we didn’t
take their stuff away like we

did, they could have beaten us,”’

he said.

The victory comes off Satur-
day’s 10-8 loss to Towson State
where a W&L second-half com-
eback fell short in the fourth
quarter.

“There were a couple of big
plays that looked as though we
had the ball in position to get a
goal and didn’t. Those situa-
tions hurt us,”’ Daly said.

The Generals fell behind 5-2
after the first period as the
Tigers got two goals from
senior attackman Mark Miller,
who took part in seven of the 10
Towson goals.

The Generals, paced by two-
goal efforts from Mason and
senior Barry Waterman, storm-
ed back to pull within one goal
twice, only to have Tiger goalie
Gavin Moag, who ended the day
with 16 saves, shut the door.

“‘We’re fortunate to get out of
here with a win. Washington
and Lee plays real solid
lacrosse,’’ said Towson mentor
Carl Runk.

The Generals (2-4) will travel
to Williamsburg after exams
for a game against William and
Mary in the team’s ninth and
possibly final meeting as W&M
will discontinue its lacrosse pro-
gram at the end of this season.

The Generals will face off
against archrival Virginia, Sun-
day, April 15, in Charlottesville.

Netiers win three of four

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team won three of four
matches last week to give them
a record of 9-4 before beginning
their Southern tour which
begins April 9.

The Generals began the week
on Thursday by losing a close
match to Division I Richmond
by a score of 5-4.

Concerning the Richmond
match, head tennis coach Gary
Franke said, ‘‘We played really
well and I believe that we were
capable of beating them.”

After losing four of the six
singles matches, the Generals
needed to sweep the doubles in
order to win the match. Franke
said that a lot of pressure was
on yhe W&L doubles teams to
play well, but that they handled
it well winning two of the three
matches.

On Friday, the Generals re-
bounded with a 6-3 victory over
Division III Christopher New-
port. Franke stated that the
match gave a couple of his
players the chance to play
against players who were rank-
ed higher in Division III.
Although Craig Cannon (ranked
21st) lost to Detlof Schulz (rank-
ed llth) 74, 64, Roby Mize
(ranked 35th) was able to defeat
John Mourning (ranked 23rd)
6-7, 6-3, 7-5 after falling behind
2-5 in the final set.

The Generals defeated Salis-
bury State by a score of 8-1 on
Saturday. “I thought that we
really played well that day,”’
said Franke...

W&L finished the week on
Tuesday by defeating VMI 7-2 in
what Coach Franke described
as “the match for the city
championship.”

On April 9, the Generals begin

their Southern tour with five
matches on the road opening
against Division I Stetson. W&L
will play Florida Southern and
Rollins, both Division II
schools, on April 10 and 11
respectively, and finish the trip
with matches against Ogel-
thorpe and Emory on April 13
and 14.

Kelly paces golfers

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

Captain Whit Kelly’s 78 paced
the Washington and Lee golfers
past two of three opponents in a
four-team match Tuesday at
the Lexington Country Club.

The Generals posted a team
score of 326 to finish ahead of
squads from neighboring VMI
(329) and Old Dominion Athletic
Conference opponent Bridge-
water (337). W&L was topped,
however, by another ODAC foe,
Lynchburg. The Hornets took
top team honors with a 321
score.

Coach Buck Leslie said he
was pleased with the team’s
victories and felt the Generals
had a good chance to defeat the
Hornets.

“Lynchburg got a 79 from
their No. 5 man (Peter Burch)
that we weren’t able to pick

up,” he said, explaining that the
Generals were relatively even
with the Hornets at the other
positions. The 79 was one of
three sub-80 scores posted on
the day. Leslie attributed the
low number of sub-80 scores to
the course playing very tough in
the less-than-ideal weather con-
ditions,

Leslie said W&L needs to
strengthen their five and six
positions because ‘‘we’ll need
help from there if we’re going to
win the big matches.”

Leslie also said the Generals
were suffering from a lack of
playing time, citing the cancel-
led matches against Bluefield
and Rochester as hurting the
team’s early season efforts.

‘‘We’ve worked hard,” Leslie
said, ‘‘but we’re just going to
have to work harder than we’ve
been working.”

Tracksters run past
Roanoke, Apprentice

The Washington and Lee
track depth, which resulted in
the ODAC Indoor track cham-
pionship, was evident again in
the Generals’ win of a tri-meet
with ODAC-rival Roanoke and
Newport News Apprentice
Tuesday at Wilson Field. W&L
had 86 points, while Newport
News Apprentice finished with
49 and Eastern Mennonite had
43.

The Generals also _ par-
ticipated in the Liberty Baptist
Invitational meet on Saturday.
There was no team scoring in
the competition, but a number
of individual Generals put in top

performances.

Junior Mark Pembroke, who
broke his own 800-meter school
record with a time of 1:55.1, and
senior Angus McBryde, who
covered 1,500-meters in 3:59.9,
indicating he may be recover-
ing from a bout with mono-
nucleosis, were two of many
standouts.

“T am very encouraged with
our results this early in the
season,” said head coach Nor-
ris Aldridge. “Our success
depends on a team effort, and
thus far, everyone has been con-
tributing.”’

Triathlon approaches

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Athletic Department is sponsor-
ing a race next month, and, of
the 20 people who have entered
so far, one of the favorites is a
51-year-old man.

So, all you boob-tube boobs
who’ve been gobbling potato
chips while watching the
NCAAs, get out, jog, get in
shape and enter the race,
because anyone can win a race
against an old man.

Here’s all you’ve got to do:
Get up on the morning of Sun-
day, April 29, and go over to
Warner Center; swim 30 laps in
the pool, ride your bike 12 miles
and then run another 3.1 miles.

Better start wolfing down the
Wheaties right now.

Yes, it’s W&L’s first and
hopefully annual _ Triathlon,
directed by assistant basketball
coach Tim McDonald and a host
of other athletic types.

Although still in its organizing
stage, the triathlon is definitely
set for April 29, with the rain-
date a week later.

‘‘We pretty much have it on
track right now,’’ McDonald
said, not intending the horrible
pun.

Former Sports Information
Director Ken Ries, now the SID

of the triathlon with McDonald.
Assistant Athletic Director

part and Coach Robert New-
comb is handling the swim-
ming.

And checking in as veteran
triathlete is Athletic Director
William McHenry, who has
completed a course longer than
W&L’s in one hour and 45
minutes.

Although he recently injured
his back, he said yesterday
there was a 50/50 chance of his
competing.

Before his injury, McHenry
said, he was swimming 40 laps,
cycling 10. miles and running
five miles at least five days a
week.

Sounds easy, huh? Alright! I
want you out of bed at five
tomorrow morning, swallow
four raw eggs, put the ‘“‘Rocky”’
tape in your Walkman, run
around Lexington three times,
and . . . oohhh, I don’t wanna
enter no triathlon. I’ll just

otherwise never witness. Sun-
day, I got a chance to see the
NCAA Division I Ice Hockey
Championship final. The prin-
cipals were the University of
Minnesota at Duluth and Bowl-
ing Green. The game went into
a fourth sudden death overtime
period before Bowling Green
scored to win the game. Now, I
don’t. know how long ago this
championship was played
(knowing ESPN it could be
anywhere from last week to last
year), but then again that didn’t
seem to matter all that much. It
was just a pleasure to watch
such an athletic contest. Here
we had a group of young men
and their coaches toiling. in
relative obscurity, waiting to be
recognized and justifiably so, as
I soon saw. It was refreshing to
just sit back and be amazed at
how enjoyable a good game is
when it doesn’t matter who
wins. Too often (but then, I
guess, it can only be expected)
we’re caught up in the ‘‘Is my
team winning?”’ attitude and
we see only half of the great
plays. We’re so busy hating
“the other team’’ that we miss

the point of watching an athletic
contest. We should simply be
witnesses of athletes striving to
do their best and revel in our
observations. It’s difficult to be
a non-partisan observer, es-
pecially in a sporting event, but
if the opportunity ever presents
itself, do yourself a favor and

take advantage of it....

....Returning to the colon-
nade, I’ve been informed I
made a mistake last week. It
was Lacrosse magazine not In

reconsider its Division I status.
Machts nichts. Still a thought-
less suggestion....By the way, it
seemed that everytime
lacrossers got within a step,
they took two steps back. Let’s

pressive) has permanently
reversed the trend....Looking

Rugby loses to

UR, throttles
hamsters

The Washington and Lee
rugby team split a pair of con-
tests over the weekend, losing
to the University of Richmond,
24-15, and throttling the club
from Hampden-Sydney, 27-4, to
even their season record at
1-1-1,

Saturday, the Generals fell
short of the Richmond squad
despite the play of Dave Arthur,
who scored a try and Captain
Herb Funsten, who added a cou-
ple of penalty kicks.

Against the Hamsters on Sun-
day, W&L was able to turn
things around in impressive
fashion as Arthur, Nick
Berents, John Miller and Jack
Cleary scored tries and Bill
Jones added a penalty kick.
Charlie Baker also turned a fine
all-around performance against
H-SC.

Contact

(continued from page 1)

Snyder has not traced the
deficit back any further than
the $6,000 negative Contact
balance at the end of the 1982
fiscal year. To do so, he said,
would involve records which
are now “‘in the vault.”’ He said
he would initiate such a search
at Epley’s direction.

Neither of the two University
officials was certain why the
shortfall was not realized and
the organization’s officers con-
tacted.

Contact is provided with mon-
thly, computerized statements
showing the exact status of its
University account. In inter-
views, both Harmon and Slahor
acknowledged having received
the reports.

‘People go by the budget
they’re given,” Slahor said.
‘“‘We’d been allotted the budget,

 

 

so we assumed we had that
much money tospend.”’

“T don’t think it’s incumbent
on the new, entering committee

to be the watchdog for former
committees,’ he said. ‘‘I don’t
think it was up to us to catch it.”

Epley said he expects the
funding problem would have
been noticed when the books
were closed for this fiscal year,
which ends June 30. “I think we
would have blown the whistle
then,” he said.

‘“‘We thought sooner or later
they’d get caught up,’’ Snyder
said. ‘‘We thought they might
have sources of revenue we
knew nothing about.”

‘“‘We rely on the students to
budget and spend responsibly,
spending no more than they
have,” Epley said. ‘‘We got sur-
prised this year.”’

chairman of Contacts ’82 and
’83, said when reached by
telephone in Dallas that he was
unaware of any deficit spending
involving Contact. ‘‘It would
have been quite apparent if
we’d had a negative balance,”
he said.

“TI would tend to think there’s
been some sort of mixup,” he
said. “I have trouble believing
that six or ten thousand dollar
deficits wouldn’t have been
pointed out if they had actually
been occurring.”’

Shortly after Contact’s deficit
problem came to light, it was
determined that $13,500 in addi-
tional funds would be needed to
meet the obligations already in-
curred by Contact ’84 and still
keep the organization solvent,
according to Epley.

An agreement was arranged
under which a portion of the
shortfall would be recovered
immediately from Executive
Committee reserve funds, and
the rest would be realized
through deductions from the
next two years of Contact
budgets.

In the meantime, Epley said
the University would fulfill Con-
tact’s obligations using
‘general University revenue.”’

The plan calls for $2,900 to be
taken from the EC reserve fund
and, assuming the same level of
funding for Contact as in past

years, for $5,200 to come from
its 1984-85 budget and for $5,400
to come from its 1985-86 budget.
‘That means they would pro-
bably reduce the number of
speakers, or get less expensive
speakers,” Epley said. ‘‘The
alternative was to cut out Con-
tact completely for a year or
two, and nobody wanted that.”’
Referring to the $2,900 ap-
propriation from the EC
reserve fund, Epley said Snyder
“could make that entry right
now and capture that amount.”

Thus Epley was under the im-
pression from Slahor, who was
the liaison, that the agreement
was binding.

However, EC Vice President
Dave Judge, who manages stu-
dent body funds, said that the
document in question is a ‘‘ten-
tative agreement” and that the
committee has not voted on it.

He said he is investigating
Contact’s financial status and
will make a presentation to the
committee early in the spring
term.

EC President Robert C. Jene-
vein said that he is aware of the
Situation but has not yet
brought it before the commit-
tee. He said the matter has not
been discussed in executive ses-
sion.

which is dated March 15, is on

Executive Committee | sta-
tionery, and is signed by David

C. Judge, Gov Slahor and Mar-
tin Harmon.

It is titled ‘Proposal for Con-
Committee Repayment
Plan,’’ and concludes by
stating, ‘‘These funds are to be
paid to the University.”

When informed that the EC
had not approved the funds,
Epley said that because the
three had signed it, he thought
the plan had been finalized. °

“By ‘proposal,’ I thought they
‘meant that the terms were
agreeable to them if they were
agreeable to us,”’ Epley said.
‘They were agreeable to us.”’

He said that Slahor did not in-
form him of the apparently ten-
tative nature of the document.

“T think there is little doubt as
far as I understand it that the
EC will approve it,’’ Slahor
said. ‘It was not in my view a
flippant gesture on their part.’’

“When I talked with Epley,
we could either cancel the pro-
gram, or find a solution,’ he
said.
Slahor said he considered the
amount requested from EC

reserves ‘‘quite fair.”’
‘We inherited the problem

from the previous Contact,’
Harmon said. ‘‘We had to work
out a compromise that wouldn’t
hinder this program or those of

future years.’’
