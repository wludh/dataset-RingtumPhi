Convention

preparations

— began two
years ago

By JOHN WILTSE
Mock Convention Correspondent

When the first drum rolls
tomorrow morning and the ban-
ner announcing the ‘‘Washington
and Lee 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention’’ begins to make its
way down Main Street, a week-
end consisting of over two years
of preparation will have begun.

The long cycle of research and
planning will be complete for co-
chairmen Steve Lewis and Pete
Muller.

Having all eyes focused on
Washington and Lee for this
event, with its $102,500 budget
and accomodations for thou-
sands of participants, one would
expect an air of tension and anx-
iety around those student
organizers responsible for the
quadrennial project — but none
can be found.

‘We are better prepared than
any other convention. We wished
it was this past weekend,” said
Lewis, a senior. ‘‘The tension of
not having things done is just not
there.”’

The two chairmen have follow-
ed a broai four-stage process
beginning in May 1982, with their
permanent appointments by the
Executive Committee and lead-
ing up to the opening gavel
tomorrow afternoon.

Lewis and Muller explained
that the first stage lasted ap-
proximately six months and con-
sisted of ‘‘establishing our direc-
tion’’ by looking through the files
of previous conventions and
creating an organizational
framework, budget and
schedule.

A three-month appointment
stage, which Muller described as
a ‘‘tedious process,’’ followed in
October 1982. Applications and
interviews were processed for
the positions of 50 state chair-
men as well as approximately 20
members of the Steering Com-
mittee, which consists of the
heads of the various convention
committees.

The third phase, beginning
last spring and continuing into
this past fall, was described by
Lewis as ‘‘when we molded
everything together and saw the
gaps ... we saw people we had to
replace among the state
chairmen and the Steering Com-
mittee.”’

In September the EC rescind-
ed the appointment of the third
Mock Convention chairman, in
charge of political research,
Save Matrazzo. The resigna-

tions of Len Howard, Lower
South Regional Coordinator, and
John Haywood, Facilities Chair-
man, followed the EC’s decision.

“It was definitely our lowest
point,’’ Muller said. ‘‘We simply
had to consolidate the leadership
in the upper echelon.”’

At the time of the organiza-
tional shake-up, Student Body
President Bob Jenevein termed
it ‘potentially very destruc-
tive.”’

‘“‘We did have the potential to
fall behind schedule, but it just
didn’t slow us down,” Muller
concluded.

The 1984 chairmen worked
within the basic Washington and
Lee convention structures con-
sisting of two main branches —
the Steering Committee and the
state chairmen.

“We brought the Steering
Committee along to a point
where they knew their job well,
so they could relate their posi-
tion and direction to the in-
dividual state chairmen, Lewis
explained. ‘It was interesting
watching Steering Committee
members make presentations to
the chairmen without having to
rely on us for everything.”’

The major change from
previous conventions cited by
the two chairmen was in the
Steering Committee framework.
They split up some tasks that
had been under one steering
committee member and created
new positions when they saw the
need.

Unlike past conventions,
Muller and Lewis also shared
the responsibilities of chairmen
with the authority ‘‘coming from
both of us.’’ Both students sat in
on Steering Committee and state
chairmen meetings and worked

.in all facets of the planning.

“‘What we did was broaden our
responsibilities while tightening
up on the Steering Committee
positions,’’ Muller said.

Commenting on W&L’s “‘sys-
tem’’ for predicting the correct
presidential nominee, Lewis and
Muller said that the key to the
success is each state chairman’s
doing political research in his

State. —
Ensuring the 13th correct

prediction became the job of
Jack Dent during the convention
reorganization process in Oc-
tober. It was at this time that
Dent, a senior, was named chair-
man of the Credentials Commit-
tee and became responsible for
coordinating the political resear-
ch.

The Credentials Committee is

composed of Dent along with the
four regional research coor-
dinators. In addition to oversee-
ing each state’s political
research throughout the cam-
paign, the committee will serve
as the final political check for
each state chairman at the con-
vention.

Serious research began in Oc-
tober and November of 1983.

“The political
was not done last spring as it
should have been...that is why I
was appointed,”’ Dent said.

Dent described the political
research process as simply lay-
ing the groundwork of contacts
and organization and then just
keeping abreast of develop-
ments through various re-
sources.

He stressed that the state
chairmen have been doing the
research and said that ‘‘we (the
Credentials Committee) are let-

ting them make the prediction.... .

It is their thing now.”

Dent said that some of the
chairmen split up the respon-
sibilities of political research by
districts and have gotten many
members of their delegations in-
volved.

“Many of the state chairmen
and regional coordinators know
much more politically than I
do,”’ he said, adding that in the
past two weeks he has been con-
centrating on the organizational
details of the Convention with
Lewis and Muller.

For those state chairmen
whose states have not had their
primaries or caucuses yet, their
work has been one long research
process continuing through
Saturday.

For the other three-quarters of
the state chairmen, whose
states already have gone to the
voting booth, the last few months
have been spent verifying their
state delegate counts and con-
centrating on determing the
preference of any uncommitted
delegates.

Dent cited three major
political barometers the student
researchers utilized. Factual in-
formation about the campaign
was obtained from the press
while party leaders served as
contacts for inside and subjec-
tive information. Questionnaires
sent out to various people were
helpful in confirming their final
hypothesis.

groundwork.

Each state chairman has also
familiarized himself with his
state’s rules governing the loyal-
ty of delgates in case the mock
nomination should go beyond the
first ballot, which Dent feels is

kely.

ent and his staff did not have
much to work with as far as
political information from past
conventions was concerned.
_ ‘We had seen barely what
they had done in the past, and
then we learned by experience
..., altering things which didn’t
work along the way,” Dent said.

A common goal mentioned by
all leaders of this year’s Mock
Convention has been to keep ac-
curate records to pass on to
future conventions.

One of the new political tools
begun by this convention was the
predicting of state primary and
caucus results. The W&L predic-
tions had a 65-70 percent ac-
curacy rate.

“Predicting the primaries
really got the political ball roll-
ing,”’ Dent said.

Dent admits that a complex
nomination still exists just in the
fact of having three candidates
left in the race and 35-40 percent
of the delegates still to be
chosen. At the end of last
week, Walter Mondale had ap-
proximately 1,236 delegates to
Gary Hart’s 670 and Jesse
Jackson’s 206 delegates with
roughly 1,400 delegates still to be
selected before July.

Dent said that once the uncom-
mitted delegates start to commit
their votes, Mondale will most
likely be ‘‘put over the top.”

647 votes will be needed to
secure the nomination at the
Mock Convention.

“We are 99 percent sure of a
correct presidential nominee,”
related co-chairmen Lewis and
Muller.

For the past two weeks; the
politcal emphasis has been on
the vice presidential nomina-
tion. Each state chairman has
been researching possible can-
didates from his state and
leaders have been finalizing a
list of nominees.

Sen. Lloyd Bentsen from
Texas seems to be a popular can-
didate and a likely nominee ac-
cording to Dent.

The financial end of the 1984
convention has also developed

into a strong and supportive
aspect.

At the end of last September
only one-fifth of the projected
budget had been raised while the
end of last week saw 90 percent
of all funds raised, according to
Mike Shelton, treasurer for the
Mock Convention.

The remaining 10 percent of
the budget is expected to be rais-
ed this week in memorabilia
sales and final contributions
with the convention ending up
“‘in the black.”’

Having no lists from previous
conventions to use as a guide,
fund-raising efforts began in
September with contributions
solicited from alumni, former
convention participants, parents
and the individual state delega-
tions.

Shelton was very pleased with
the efforts of the delegations in
raising close to $20,000; $5,000 of
which went to the Steering Com-
mittee. A total of $8,000 was rais-
ed through contribution and the
February pavilion party.

The remainder of the Mock
Convention funds came from a
Hatton W. Sumners’ Foundation
grant that totaled $31,000 in
February and another $14,000 in
interest resulting from a
separate endowment also given
to W&L by the Sumners’ Foun-
dation.

A final $10,000 came from stu-
dent taxes.

The 1984 budget has been by
far the largest of any Mock Con-
vention.

“I was overwhelmed with the
fund-raising response we got,”’
Shelton said. ‘‘It is a testimony
to the high regard the convention
is held in across the country.”’

That high regard will be tested
this weekend when the 18th W&L
Mock Convention is convened.

Many processes and cycles
have been completed to bring
this event to its completion.
Muller summed it up this way in
speaking about his goals for the
Convention: ‘“‘It should be a
sense of a shared project ... a
culmination of a lot of people to
be proud together of what we
have done.”

The EC already has called for
the applications for the tem-
porary chairmen of the 1988
Mock Convention. With the clos-
ing gavel on Saturday, a new cy-
cle of success will begin.

Conservatives & their liberal education

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

For many Washington and Lee
students, the Mock Convention
will be just that, a ‘‘mock” con-
vention, although not in the pe-
jorative sense.

Many students will be arguing
for Democratic candidates and
issues they could never support
in real life. Of course, this is not
the first time that this has oc-
curred at our traditionally con-
servative campus.

According to junior Scott
Tilley, who served as president
of W&L’s College Republicans
this year and will work on the
state level next year, the 1976
Mock Convention was especially
divided. The College Republi-
cans were so upset with the plat-
form submitted by the Platform
Committee that year that they
had the Committee’s platform
defeated and submitted their
own proposals, which were pass-
ed. by a majority of the
delegates. Tilley, who chairs this
year’s Platform Committee, will
not allow a similar incident to
occur this weekend.

A major question is whether
W&L is as conservative as
everyone believes, and what ef-
fect this will have on our Conven-
tion. “I’ve heard many times
that W&L is one of the most con-
servative schools in the eoun-
try,” Tilley said. While he has no
data on where the University
ranks on a conservative scale,
Tilley believes this to be true,

and uses as evidence the com-
parative size of the College
Republicans (200 members,
each paying four dollars dues)
and the University’s Young
Democrats (less than a dozen
members and no dues. )

Convention co-Chairman
Peter Muller feels that the
school is definitely Republican,
but that liberals on campus feel
too intimidated to be vocal.
“There is a more liberal under-
current which is less pronounc-
ed,’’ Muller said.

If such an undercurrent does
exist, it has not resulted in any
left-wing or liberal groups that
other campuses find a need for,
according to Tilley.

With the campus’ conser-
vative tendencies and the large
number of College Republicans
participating in the Convention,
two more major questions arise:
“Do the students have any pro-
blem representing a viewpoint
they don’t believe in?’”’ and ‘‘Has
working on the Mock Convention
affected students’ views?”’.

“TI can separate (my personal
views and Convention views). I
have to do the research in my
state. There’s really nothing per-
sonal about that,’ Vermont
State Chairman Ron Fenster-
macher said, adding, ‘‘I would
find it very hard to argue against
what I think.”

Mike Bearup, chairman of the
New Mexico delegation, feels it
is a good idea for students to be
exposed to both sides, although
the Convention has not altered

   

his political outlook. ‘‘I don’t see
any conflicts,” he said.

Muller does feel that the Con-
vention has affected his outlook.
“It may have dulled my ada-
mant Republican views a bit. It
made me more sympathetic to
Democratic views,”’ he said.

“Tt hasn’t really affected me
either way,’’ said the Conven-
tion Executive Director, Lee
Feldman, a senior and a mem-
ber of the College Republicans.
“| know that I have my views
outside of the Convention.”’

Tilley feels that working as
Platform Chairman has actually
solidified his Republican ideas
because he discovered how
““Judicrous’’ some of the
Democratic planks are. “It

helped polarize my views,”
Tilley said.

But Tilley said he and his com-
mittee have developed a plat-
form that may be more liberal
than anything the Democrats
could ever produce. It may seem
odd that the committee would
develop such an authentic plat-
form but that is in the spirit of
the Convention, which can be
divided into two parts.

The major part of the Conven-
tion is the students’ striving for
authenticity in determining the
party’s candidate. The second
part is the students’ opportunity
to voice personal opinions con-
cerning the platform.

“The way we’re doing it is
good,”’ Tilley said. ‘Once we’ve
researched it (the platform), I

 

aoe CQ lendar

think it’s good that we can have
the students’ input.”

Indiana State Chairman Greg
Flentje considers it a smart idea
to allow student opinion to be ex-
pressed in the platform. ‘‘The
platform will be the most dif-
ficult to argue against their
views,”’ he said.

“It’s important to have some
aspect that represents the
University,’’ said Bearup, who
believes that it would be too dif-
ficult for a delegation to
research the platform accurate-
ly.

According to Muller, the Con-
vention is meant to be both ac-
curate and collegiate. “It (the
platform) is such a stringent
Democratic view...moderated
by W&L students.”

As the media concentrate on
the Convention’s accuracy the
platform gives the students the
occasion to make their views
known to the nation, according
to Feldman. “The platform is

present our views. It’s our
chance to actually be heard,”’ he
explained.

Marion County, Ind., offers an
example of what it is like
to be a Democrat in a very

‘Republican sector of the nation

or on a very Republican campus.
Supposedly the second most
Republican district in the nation,
Marion County was ger-
rymandered street by street
following the 1980 census.

Marion County Democratic
Chairman John Livengood be-
lieves that there are actually
more Democrats than Republi-
cans in the county. His approach
to politics may be the opposite of
what some would expect.
“Traditionally, Marion County
... has been a primary (election)
influence,’’ Livengood said.
“‘We’ve shifted gears since I’ve
been chairman.”’

Rather than concentrate on
the primary, where the party
could have definite influence,
the Democrats have switched
emphasis to the November elec-
tion, which any decent
Republican candidate is almost
sure to win. The Democrats will
not publicly endorse any can-
didate in the primary in an at-

tempt not to divide the party
during the general election,
Livengood said. ai : ER

Livengood presents an overly ''* . 7 <a a -
positive attitude in an area , al
where a liberal would seem to
have little to be positive about.
Terming his party ‘‘out-
organized and out-financed,”
Livengood still is optimistic.

‘“‘We’re going to make our can-
didates competitive,’’ he said.
For the most part, the
Democratic candidates in
Marion County who have been
competitive are those who
display a more conservative
outlook.

No matter how weak a state’s
Democratic party, none of the
states will have trouble attract-
ing delegates for the real
Democratic Presidential Con-
vention in San Francisco. On the
W&L campus, that is hardly the
case.

At a University where many
students will not go to hear a
Soviet speaker because he is a
Communist, could it be that die-
hard conservatives are bypass-
ing this year’s Convention
because it is Democratic? The

correlation does not seem to ex-
ist.

According to Feldman, both
the incoming and outgoing State
Chairmen of the Virginia College
Republicans are traveling to
Lexington: this weekend to

delegate slots with Lexington
High School students, and at-
tributes the poor turnout com-
pared to the 1980 Republican
Convention to student apathy.
“I’ve seen increased student
apathy toward events,”’ he said.

Tilley believes that the lower

political outlook ‘‘only on a very
superficial level.”” ‘“‘They (the
students) realize this is a one-
time thing when they’re here,”
he said.

With the large number of
dyed-in-the-wool Republicans
who are participating, it does not

that students are shying away
because of political ideology.
Those who are strong Republi-
cans can still take heart in the
fact this is a Mock Democratic
Convention and, like Tilley,
should hope that W&L holds a

Republicans will always be in
power.

For better or for worse, no
matter how accurate our predic-
tions, this weekend’s quadren-
nial event will certainly have to
go down in W&L’s annals as one

turnout can be attributed to every four years. That, of of our truly mock conventions.

The tale of one state delegation

By MIKE SINGER
and
PARKER SCHENEKER
Summer Interns

A year ago the 1984 Mock Con-
vention was just a distant vision
of some unknown (or rather
‘‘well-known’’) happening,
perhaps even bigger than Fancy
Dress itself. After the positions
for state chairmen of the Con-
vention had been filled through
the application and interview
process, we began some early
work in preparation for the com-
ing year.

During the spring of 1983 we
began to brainstorm about the
possibilities for the Texas
Delegation, especially in fund-
raising. .Having printed our
delegation stationery, we sent
our first fund-raising letters to
graduating seniors. Although we
received no response, we had
our first exposure to the hard-
ships of soliciting for delegation
funds.

During the summer a slew of
letters was sent to raise money
for the delegation. Working with
delegation Secretary Anthony
Interrante, three different let-
ters were sent to parents of
delegates, parents of potential
delegates and parents of enter-
ing freshmen from Texas. At the
time we were unsure as to the
response to the letters, but we
had made a good effort, per-
sonalizing each letter and typing
every envelope. The letter would
eventually raise over $7000! In
addition, we sent letters to. the

co-chairmen of the Texas Dele-
gation of the 1980 Mock Conven-
tion. The response was prompt
and most helpful.

When we returned in the fall,
we began efforts to find cor-
porate sponsors. A letter was
sent to Dod Distributing Com-
pany, the major distributor of
Coors beer in the area, two days
after our return to Lexington.
We had chosen Coors as the of-
ficial beer because of its great
popularity in Texas, plus the
availability of it in the area. A
week after sending the letter, we
received a telephone call from
Steve Dod, president of the com-
pany, to meet him in Lexington.
During our visit with him, we
were assured of a sponsorship by
Coors.

We returned in the winter to
meet with Mr. Dod’s assistant,
Henley Carter, and Michele
Burgwyn, the ‘young-adult
coordinator’ for the regional
Coors office in Charlotte, N.C. At
the meeting with Carter and
Burgwyn, we finalized plans for
a float design and received
Coors paraphernalia. In addi-
tion, Mr. Carter promised us
$500 to “cover research ex-
penses.’’ When we returned to
Lexington that.day, we informed
the Steering Committee of the
sponsorship.

The money from the three
summer letters began to roll in,
as we had already raised $500
before most states had even
begun fundraising. Moreover,
our largest check was for just
$100, while most were for $25.

Before we left for Thanksgiving,
we sent 200 more letters to alum-
ni.

Our firs: delegation meeting
was Called during the latter part
of fall term, when we explained
that we would handle different
areas of delegation business.
Parker Scheneker handled the
finances, parties and float, while
Michael Singer would handle the
research, prediction and conven-
tion activities.

At our second meeting the
delegates were asked to fill out
information cards so we could
assign them to a certain area of
the convention (float, parties,
research, etc.). Perhaps the

most embarrassing point at the
meeting occurred when we ask-
ed the 30-or-so delegates if they
knew the name of their con-
gressmen. Only two or three said
they were absolutely sure! How
ironic that would later be.

With most of the states being
unable to raise sufficient
delegation funds, we decided to
give the Steering Committee our
summer solicitation letters,
along with several ideas that we
had incorporated in our letters.
The letter and the pledge
sheet/‘‘Mock Convention
History’’ was sent by every
delegation except ours, which
had already done so.

By the time the Iowa caucuses
had finished, we had printed a
research survey to be sent to our
contacts. However, with the
steering committee’s interest in
the survey, we gave it to them to
be fine-tuned for the entire Con-
vention. Furthermore, with the
race developing, we could only
hope that it would not be a Mon-
dale run-away. We began to view
the other primaries with interest
and soon began to realize that
this could very well be an in-
teresting race.

Meetings were scheduled for
the delegation every Tuesday
night, as we assigned a delegate
to each of the 27 congressional
districts. We planned on even-
tually voting on our choice for
the Democratic nomination by
district, and we decided that we
would predict the outcome of the
important May 5 Texas cau-
cuses. During every Tuesday
meeting each delegate from the
various districts gave a short
report on the political situation
in the area.

Plans had also begun for a par-
ty sponsored by Coors. Having
informed the steering commit-
tee of our plans, we were put ‘‘on
hold’’ to investigate the idea
before the February break. We
were finally informed that we
could have the party just one
month before the date we had
planned for it. Because of this,
the selection for bands was low
and dates to actually have the
party were slim-to-none. After
scheduling the party, we asked
the Alabama, Colorado and Ten-
nessee delegation to join us. All
plans were finalized.

Two days before the party, the
administration informed us that
we could face serious problems
with the law, having advertised
a ‘‘BYOB” pavilion party. After
long discussions concerning the
potential legal ramifications of
the party, we decided to go for
broke and have it. The result

Proxmire is keynote speaker

Sen. William Proxmire, a
Democrat from Wisconsin, will
deliver the Mock Convention’s
keynote address at the Conven-
tion’s final session Saturday,
May 12, beginning at 9:30 a.m.

Proxmire’s distinguished
political career goes back to
1950, when he was elected to the
Wisconsin State Assembly. In
1957 he was elected to fill the
US. Senate seat left vacant by
the death of Joseph McCarthy.
He was re-elected the following
year to his first full six-year
term and was again re-elected in
1964, 1970, 1976 and 1982.

In both the 1976 and the 1982
campaigns, Proxmire accepted
no campaign contributions and
spent less than $200.

The former chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee,
Proxmire now is ranking minori-
ty member of the Senate Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs
Committee and a member of the
Appropriations Committee and
the Congressional Joint Eco-
nomic Committee.

Proxmire has the longest un-
broken record in the Senate

for answering roll call votes. He
has not missed a single one of the
over 8,000 roll call votes since
April 1966.

Proxmire’s ‘‘golden fleece’’
award for wasting federal
money has become a monthly

Washington tradition.

According to the National Tax-
payers Union, Proxmire held the
best record in the Senate during

each of the last four years for
holding down spending.

 

fundraising paid off.

By Thursday, May 3, just two
days before the Texas Caucuses,
those delegates who had resear-
ched the various districts met to
fill out questionnaires and
ballots concerning the election.
Each had made numerous
telephone calls from the Mock
Convention office asking for the
favorite Democratic candidate
in the area and the percentage
lead of the front-runner.

From the ballots and ques-
tionaires, a group of four (Mike
Singer, David Webber, Anthony
Interrante and Markham Pyle)
met to make the prediction from
the information provided by the
questionnaires. The final predic-

tion was then posted in the Mock
Convention office a day in ad-
vance of the actual caucuses.
The greatest irony of all in-
volved the members of the
delegation who had not even
known their congressmen. They
were now predicting with amaz-
ing accuracy how their districts
would vote in the May 5 caucuses
for the Democratic nomination.
Based on months of research,
the delegation had made an ac-
curate prediction; just a few
percentage points off the actual
vote. With the work on finances,
the float and prediction in the
final stages, the Texas Delega-
tion is indeed ready for the 1984
Mock Democratic Convention.

Sen. Randolph
will present platform

Lawmaker ending 52-year career

Sen. Jennings Randolph, a
Democrat from West Virginia,
will deliver the platform address
at the convention’s second ses-
sion Friday evening.

Randolph, who will retire
following the completion of his
term in January 1985, is a
veteran of the New Deal. He was
first elected to the House of
Representatives in 1932 with the
Franklin Roosevelt administra-
tion. Defeated in 1946, he entered
the private sector and then was
elected to the Senate in 1958.

The former chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee, Randolph is
now ranking minority member

on that committee and is the sec-
ond ranking Democrat on the
Labor and Human Resources
Committee and the Committee
on Veterans’ Affairs.

During his 40-year legislative
career, Randolph, 82, has been a
champion of a nationwide trans-
portation system and the rights
of the handicapped.

One of Randolph’s brightest
moments occurred in 1971, when
the 26th Amendment to the Con-
stitution was ratified, lowering
the voting age to 18. An advocate
of allowing younger citizens to
vote, Randolph had introduced
similar legislation in the House
of Representatives as early as
1942.

Sen, Biden to open
Friday Ly night SESSION

Sen. Joseph R. Biden
Democrat from Delaware and a
leading foreign policy expert,
will deliver the opening address
at the second session of the Mock
Convention Friday evening.

Biden, 41, has served in the
U.S. Senate longer than over half
of the other 99 members. First
elected in 1972, he was re-elected
in 1978 and serves on four of the
Senate’s most powerful commit-
tees.

Biden is the ranking Democrat
on the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee, second ranking on the
Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and third ranking on the

Senate Budget Committee and
the Select Committee on In-
telligence.

Recognized as one of the
Senate’s leading foreign policy
experts, Biden was a leader in
the effort to win Senate ratifica-
tion of the SALT II treaty and is
in the forefront of most foreign
policy debates. Biden also is
chairman of the Senate Demo-
cratic Task Force on Crime.

Biden is a graduate of the
University of Delaware and the
Syracuse University School of
Law. He lives in Wilmington
with his wife, Jill, and three

Sen. Ernest ‘‘Fritz’’ Hollings,
a Democrat from South Carolina
and a former presidential can-
didate this year, will deliver
greetings from the Democratic
party at the Mock Convention’s
first session May 11.

Hollings was one of the eight
Democratic presidential can-
didates this year until he
withdrew from the race after the

New Hampshire primary.

Hollings holds several impor-
tant positions in the Senate
hierarchy. He is the ranking
Democrat on the Senate Com-
merce, Science, and Transporta-
tion Committee and is a re-
spected member of two other
powerful committees — the
Senate Appropriations Commit-
tee and the Senate Budget Com-
mittee.

Parade to begin Convention

A parade through downtown
Lexington, speeches by Virginia

_Gov. Charles Robb and four

leading U.S. senators, and the
nomination of presidential and
vice-presidential candidates will
highlight the 18th Mock Conven-
tion this weekend.

Nearly 100 student organizers
have been working for over two
years planning this weekend’s
event, which will begin tomor-
row at 10 a.m. with the tradi-
tional Mock Convention parade.

Each of the 55 state delega-
tions has built a float for the
parade, which will begin at Lex-
ington High School and wind its
way to Main Street, where it will
head north. The parade then will
turn left onto Washington Street
before finishing at the Warner
Center.

In addition to the imaginative
and creative floats, several
bands from area high schools
and some other special attrac-
tions will be featured in the
parade, which is expected to last
about two hours.

The first session of the Mock
Convention will begin at 1 p.m.
tomorrow in the Warner Center.
Following welcoming remarks
by W&L President John D.
Wilson and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips, Gov. Charles S.
Robb will deliver a brief ad-
dress.

Sen. Ernest ‘‘Fritz’’ Hollings,
D-S.C., will bring greetings from

the Democratic party to the
Mock Convention. Hollings was
one of the eight Democratic
presidential candidates this year
before withdrawing from the
race after the New Hampshire
primary Feb. 28.

Speeches by Sens. Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., and Jennings
Randolph, D-W.Va., will open
the second session, beginning
Friday at8 p.m.

Biden, 41, is one of the
Democratic party’s rising
leaders, and Randolph, 82, has
announced his retirement from
the Senate. Randolph’s congres-
sional experience began when he
was elected to the House of
Representatives in 1932 with the
Franklin Roosevelt administra-
tion and the New Deal.

Randolph’s address. will
precede the platform debate Fri-
day evening. A Mock Convention
committee, headed by junior
Scott Tilley, has prepared a plat-
form report similar to the one
the Democrats will debate at
their convention in San Fran-
cisco in July.

Mock Convention delegates
will debate and vote on various
planks of the platform, which
will be a combination of
Democratic stances and student
opinion.

The final session will convene
at9:30a.m. Saturday.

Sen. William Proxmire, D-
Wisc., will deliver the keynote

address that morning. Prox-
mire, noted for his careful
spending of both federal money
and campaign funds, has _ in-
itiated a monthly Washington
tradition with the awarding of
his ‘‘golden fleece’ awards for
the wasting of federal funds.

Following Proxmire’s ad-
dress, the actual nomination
process will begin. Just as at the
real Democratic National Con-
vention this summer, candidates
must be nominated and second-
ed in order to be considered.

When the roll-call voting
begins later that morning, an in-
teresting battle is expected to
develop between former Vice
president Walter Mondale and
Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo., with
the third remaining candidate,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, playing
an important role, according to
convention organizers.

Each of the 1,313 mock
delegates will cast three votes,
equaling the 3,939 votes that will
be cast in San Francisco this
summer. When a nominee is
selected by the Mock Conven-
tion, convention organizers hope
to contact him by telephone for
an acceptance speech.

Also Saturday, the delegates
will determine a vice-presiden-
tial nominee, a task first taken
seriously in 1976 with the correct
prediction of Mondale. That final
session is expected to end in the
early to middle afternoon.

All of the events of the Mock
Convention will be open to the
public free of charge.

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

The history of Washington and
Lee University’s Mock Conven-
tion is an often-told story, but
one whose rich tradition and
record of accuracy make it ripe
for repetition.

Political rhetoric and hoopla,
prominent speakers (including
two presidents — Truman and
Carter), national media
coverage, the death of a vice-
president and in-depth research
resulting in an uncanny record
of accuracy have made the W&L
Mock Convention the best known
and most widely respected col-
legiate political extravaganza in
the nation.

The visit of presidential can-
didate William Jennings Bryan
in 1908 gave occasion to the first
Mock Convention, which not sur-
prisingly nominated Bryan.
That convention was marked by
the only floor fights (in the
literal sense of the word) in con-
vention history, as supporters of
Governor John A. Johnson of
Minnesota became over-zealous
and invited the Bryan sup-
porters outside.

After the brawl the convention
continued, and thus began its
record of accuracy. The Lex-
ington Gazette reported after
that first convention that ‘‘the
young gentlemen entered into
the meeting with the zest of
seasoned politicians plus the en-
thusiasm of collegians.”’

The students missed in 1912,
when they nominated Ohio
governor Judson Harmon over
Woodrow Wilson, but they did
not miss again until 1936. In 1924

the convention accomplished its

most amazing feat.

Heated debate that year over a
“wet”? plank in the platform
(these were the days of Prohibi-
tion) carried over into a heated
battle for the Democratic nomi-
nation. Thirteen candidates

were nominated, and a heated
and frustrating debate ensued.
After the 22nd ballot, the north-
eastern states united behind
W&L graduate John W. Davis,
West Virginia’s favorite-son can-
didate. The ‘‘dry’’ states of Tex-
as, Ohio and Connecticut walked
out, but upon their return Davis
was nominated on the 24th
ballot.

That summer in New York Ci-
ty, the Democrats were dead-
locked for 103 ballots before a
compromise candidate was
chosen: John W. Davis. The
band struck up “The W&L Sw-
ing,’’ which became Davis’ cam-

paign theme song.
The convention went through a
dark spell from 1936-1948,

predicting incorrectly in three of

the four conventions in that —

period. In 1936 the students turn-
ed down the eventual candidate,

 

ie

3 vidas eo : - 7 : ] | y j
is

Alf Landon, for Michigan Sen.
Arthur Vandenburg. Oregon
Sen. Charles McNary was
selected in 1940 rather than the
correct choice, Wendell Wilkie,
and in 1948 W&L again went for
Vandenberg, although Thomas
Dewey would eventually get the
nod.

Since 1948, though, the Mock
Convention has been wrong only
once, in 1972. In that year the
eventual ‘‘real’’ nominee,
George McGovern, was only 25
4 votes short of the necessary
1,509 after the third ballot, but
his support waned and, as he fell
into a deadlock with Hubert
Humphrey, the convention tried
to repeat its 1924 magic with
another compromise candidate,
Edward Kennedy. This time it
was not as fortunate, as
McGovern went on to win the
California and New York

1968—cangsters pass in front of R.E. Lee Episcopal Church.

The W&L Mock Convention extravaganza
A rich history of rhetoric, speakers, hoopla and a record of accuracy

primaries to sew up the real
nomination.

Brilliant research paid off in
1952, when the convention was
deadlocked between World War
II hero Dwight Eisenhower and
Sen. Robert Taft. After three
ballots Taft led Eisenhower, and
California Governor Earl War-
ren was a distant third. The
California chairman at the con-
vention had been in touch with
Warren and received a wire
after the third ballot to swing his
support to Eisenhower, who won
the nomination. Warren was
thanked by being given the vice-
presidential bid.

conventions: Harry S. Truman
in 1960 and then-Governor Jim-
my Carter in 1972. 1964 can-
didate Barry Goldwater was the

vention, but the most dramatic

speech of all occurred in 1956,
when the entire nation turned its
eye to this small college com-
munity.

Former Vice President Alben
Barkley keynoted the convention
that year, and his fiery oratory
prowess had fired the student
delegates up. As his speech
reached a stormy climax, he
screamed, ‘‘I would rather be a
servant in the house of the Lord
than to sit in the seats of the
mighty’’ — and fell dead of a
heart attack.

‘‘You have’ unfinished
business,’ Mrs. Barkley re-
minded the convention, and it
convened one week later to
nominate Adlai Stevenson.

Seventy-six years of history
and tradition are on the line in
1984 — a tough tradition to try to
live up to.

Since 1912, Latture’s been there

92-year-old professor snseritus has supported Wilson, FDR, Truman

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

There are a few landmarks at
Washington and Lee. The Colon-
nade, Lee Chapel and Lee House
come to mind. And don’t forget
Professor Emeritus Rupert N.
Latture, a walking and talking
fount of knowledge about W&L.

For Latture, remembering the
1912 Mock Democratic Conven-
tion isn’t very difficult. His
knowledge of the event, how-
ever, doesn’t come from books
but from first-hand experience.
Latture was a student at the
time, and like most students at
the second Mock Convention he
just did what he was told.

“I was just present and
voted,”’ he said, adding with a
glint in his 92-year-old eyes, ‘‘I
was a (Woodrow) Wilson man.
Stillam.”

Even the 1916 Republican
Mock Convention stands clearly

.

in Latture’s mind.

“In 1916 I was working for my
M.A. degree,’’ Latture noted. ‘‘I
was chairman of the Tennessee
delegation that year. Had about
15 guys on that delegation, quite
a few when you consider we had
a little less than 600 students
here at the time.

“Let’s see. In 1911, we had 636
students, I believe, when I
entered. That hadn’t increased
much after 1911-1912. It decreas-
ed up until the first World War
and then came back up after the
war.”

Then there’s the 1924 conven-
tion. (Latture was quick to note
that there were no conventions
in 1920 or 1944, due to the wars).

In 1924, we nominated John W.
Davis. I was adviser to the con-
vention that year. Everybody
was surprised. The contest had
been between (Alfred) Smith
and (William) McAdoo. At the
time we needed two-thirds vote

of the delegates to nominate. It
was a real battle between those
two,”’ he said. ‘‘Of course, the
most amazing thing was that we
nominated Davis first. Nobody
expected it.”’

‘1932 was certainly important
for us also. We nominated FDR.
Then he was nominated in
Chicago three weeks afterward.
I attended the convention in
Chicago that year, quite a battle
it was. A.W. Robertson, the
Senator from Virginia, got me
tickets.

“Dr. (Frances) Gaines was
President (of the University) in
1932. His brother-in-law, a law
student named Cavat Robert,
nominated Roosevelt. He was
chairman of the New York
delegation. He now speaks
before large groups as a profes-
sion and says he discovered his
talents for speaking to audiences
while nominating FDR for the
convention in ’32,’’ he said.

His conversation slowly mov-
ed back to his experiences at the
Chicago National Democratic
Convention, (including) hearing
Roosevelt accept the nomina-
tion. This was the first time a
Presidential candidate ever ad-
dressed the nominating conven-
tion.

“In the 1932 convention, Mr.
Roosevelt flew to Chicago to ac-
cept the nomination. I was sit-
ting about as close to him as the
wall over there,’’ he noted, point-

€

17 S. Main St.

ing to a wall about 12 feet away.
“TI was in the balcony above the
podium.”

“I remember two or three
things about the 1932 convention.
One was the Chicago delegation.
They were afraid Roosevelt
wasn’t wet enough. They were
afraid he couldn’t get enough
money or that he would push for
more liquor, hard liquor. I saw
Al Smith. Saw Huey Long but
didn’t speak to him.

“At the last meeting of the
convention, we found out
Roosevelt was coming to town.
So they decided on an additional
session. I didn’t have a ticket to
it. Hadn’t anticipated it. I was
staying at the Steven’s Hotel in
Chicago, and when the New
York delegation came into the
lobby, I walked up to one of them
and asked where I might get a
ticket. One guy said, ‘Here. Take
the damn ticket.’ He was mad Al
Smith hadn’t been nominated. So
I got to hear Roosevelt,” he said.

Roosevelt wasn’t the only
president whom Latture
remembers readily. He recalls
Harry Truman’s visit to the 1960
Mock Convention and _then-
Georgia Governor Jimmy
Carter’s address to the 1972 con-
vention.

“TI remember Harry Trumea
very well. He and Dr. Gaines sat
out and watched the parade on
the lawn between the Presi-
dent’s house and (R.E, Lee)

Episcopal,’’ Latture said. “I
didn’t have much contact with
him. Just shook hands.”’

“In 1972, Carter left a
favorable impression on the con-
vention. A fine man,”’ he said.

The convention that made the
biggest news was the 1956 con-
vention, when former Vice
President Alben Barkley. died
after finishing his adress to the
convention.

“TI was sitting as close as the
door to Barkley,’’ said Latture,
pointing to a door about 12 feet
away. ‘‘He had said his famous
statement — ‘I would rather bea
servant in the house of the Lord
than sit in the seats of the
mighty’ — and then stepped
back. He was standing on a plat-
form on the podium and there
were ribbons around the edge. I
thought he had fallen when ac-
tually he had died. In a few
moments, we realized he had
dropped dead. He fell right at
Mrs. Barkley’s feet. Some
photographer tried to take his
picture as he lay there. Dr.
Gaines didn’t think that was too
appropriate and didn’t allow it.
Of course, Mrs. Barkley insisted
they continue the convention,
though they stopped the conven-
tion for a few days,’’ he said.
“We went on to nominate
(Adlai) Stevenson.”

Will Latture attend this
weekend’s convention, his 17th
and the University’s 18th Mock
Convention?

“Oh, I guess I’ll take a look in.
I’ve seen every convention since
the first one in 1912. Only missed
the 1908 convention,’ he said,
chuckling.

After all, he’s only one shy of
perfect attendance.

Convention

finances in
good shape

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

With $95,333 raised as of Mon-
day, the W&L Mock Democratic
Convention should reach _ its
fund-raising goal of $102,500 this
week, according to Treasurer
Michael Shelton.

“This week memorabilia
(went) on sale. We ought to see
our goal reached if not surpass-
ed,’’ Shelton said.

Shelton said that the $95,333
raised so far represents 93 per-
cent of the total budget. The
Mock Convention has_ spent
$48,000 so far. Shelton said the
Mock Convention expected to
make $10,000 from the sale of
memorabilia this week.

Shelton said that as the con-
vention approached, the pace of
contributions and expenditures
increased. As evidence, Shelton
reported that between April 18
and May 3 the Mock Convention
raised $3,548 and spent $17,460.

State committees should begin
spending a large amount of their
money this week, as they begin
construction of floats, Shelton
said. State committees are allot-
ted $20,000 of the total budget,
and the 13 committees and the
reserve fund of the Mock Con-
vention are allocated the re-
maining $82,500, Shelton explain-
ed

‘We hope to leave a little nest
egg for the next convention,”’ he
said, anticipating a small
surplus.

Shelton said a large part of the
convention’s success in fund
raising was due to a $25,000 bond
the Hatton Sumners’ Foundation
gave the Mock Convention.
Shelton said the bond has bee

the contribution.

The Sumners’ Foundation also
gave the University a $100,000
endowment, from which the
Mock Convention has received
$14,000 in earnings on the in-
terest, Shelton said.

Believing that businesses
would also be willing to donate
money to the Mock Convention,
Shelton said that early fund-
raising attempts were directed
at companies and banks. How-
ever, response from business
was “‘zilch,’’ Shelton said.

Consequently, in November
the Mock Convention began
sending out requests for dona-
tions to alumni, parents and
relatives of students. The
response from this campaign
was tremendous Shelton said.

‘‘We had a list of every parent
of the University. We contacted
friends and family. We were
very surprised with the re-
sponse, he said.

Shelton said the state commit-
tees also have been successful in
raising funds. The states have
almost reached their $25,000
goal, of which $5,000 went to the
Mock Convention in _ taxes,
Shelton added.

“States from all around the
country have been able to raise
money. Many delegates will ap-
proach their family and
friends,’’ Shelton said, explain-
ing why states like California,
with large delegations but few
students at W&L, have been able
to raise funds.

Shelton said that the Mock
Convention’s fund-raising ef-
forts would have been aided if

the staff of the previous Mock
Convention had left records of
their fund-raising efforts.

“When we came in we had no
records of the previous conven-
tion’s progress. It would have
been helpful to understand how
they raised funds.”’

“This convention will leave ex-
cellent records. The two
chairmen have done a study on
the progress of the convention,”
he added.

Shelton said that the fund-
raising efforts have been tedious
at times but that he has enjoyed
it.

‘Hopefully, this convention
will be a weekend when every-
one will learn something about
the political process, and a suc-
cessful budget will enhance the
prospects for that,’’ he com-
mented.
