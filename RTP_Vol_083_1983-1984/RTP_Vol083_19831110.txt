Former CIA agent will speak

John Stockwell, a former
agent of the Central In-
telligence Agency who has writ-
ten a controversial analysis of
covert action in the Angola civil
war, will present a lecture en-
titled ‘‘The Secret Wars of the
CIA” today at 8 p.m. in Lee
Chapel. The public is invited.
Admission is free.

The program is part of Con-
tact ’83, a speaker symposium
sponsored by the interfraternity
council and the student body.

A former case officer in
Africa and Vietnam, Stockwell
served in the CIA from 1964 to
1977 when he quit the agency in

anger over what he considered
the ‘‘dirty tricks’ engaged in by
the Agency.

“In Search of Enemies’’ is
Stockwell’s 1978 book in which
he argues that the CIA ought to

 

be dismantled ‘‘for the good of
the United States and the
world.” He was sued by the CIA
as a result of his book.

He has —_* on CEe-TY s

‘60 Minutes,’’ ‘‘NBC
Magazine’ and _ several
documentary films.

Stockwell has charged that
the “‘CIA poses the ultimate
threat to democracy and is a

major cause of the world’s
move toward nuclear extinc-
tion.”’

A native of Texas, Stockwell
was raised in the Belgian Congo
where his father was an
engineer. He graduated from
the University of Texas and
served three years on active du-
ty in the Marine Corps and 19
years in the Marine Corps
Reserve.

During his 13 years as a CIA
field case officer, he was chief
of station in Africa, spent two
years in Vietnam, and was a
eommander of the Angola ‘l'ask
Force in 1975-78.

Lexington man

NOV1 11963

indicted for rape

G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

A Lexington man has been in-
dicted on one count of rape and
one count of statutory burglary
in connection with the Sept. 15
incident involving a Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College stu-
dent at the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity house, 106 N. Main St.

The indictment against
Daniel Robert Tinsley, 20, of 224
Maury St., was handed down
Monday by a Rockbridge Coun-
ty grand jury.

If convicted, Tinsley could
face from five years to life in
prison on the rape count and up

.to 20 years on the statutory

burglary count, according to
Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sut-
ton.

Tinsley was indicted on the
statutory burglary count, Sut-
ton said, because allegedly he
entered the house with the in-
tent to commit a larceny or
rape and that this intent ‘‘was
verified by the act itself.’’

Although Sutton said he could
not give the specifics on how the
evidence was gathered because
“that gets into evidence that
should be presented before the
court,” he did say, “‘it was
gathered, for the greater part,
through forensic science.”

Sutton called forensic science
“a tremendous investigating
tool.”’

“Tll use any investigative
tool at my disposal,”’ he added.

Sutton said evidence gathered
from the scene of the crime was
taken to the forensics labor-
atory in Roanoke for analysis.

The student was sleeping in a
bedroom on the second floor of
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity fraternity house when she
was assaulted about 3:45 in the
morning, police said at the
time.

A fraternity member in
another room was awakened by
her struggling and removed the
assailant from the house.

Tinsley is being held in
Rockbridge County jail. No trial
date has been set.

 

 

WGL Parents’ Weekend
focuses on student life

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will observe its 29th annual
Parents’ Weekend Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

Designed to encourage
among the parents of W&L
students a greater understand-
ing of the university, the
weekend will feature numerous
activities to acquaint the
parents with various aspects of
student life at W&L.

The weekend will begin with a
series of open houses in univer-
sity departments and will also
include a Friday evening con-
cert by three of the university’s
musical organizations and the
annual President’s Reception.

In addition to more open
houses on Saturday, parents
will be invited to participate in

 

Calendar on page 11

 

seminars with members of the
university’s faculty and admin-
istration and student leaders.

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson will deliver
his annual Report to Parents in
Lee Chapel on Saturday morn-
ing at 11:30 a.m.

The Washington and Lee foot-
ball team will conclude its
season by playing Lebanon
Valley on Wilson Field on Satur-
day afternoon, and the Univer-
sity Theatre will present
‘“‘Rashomon’”’ on Saturday eve-
ning.

Throughout the weekend, the
parents are also encouraged to
meet individually with faculty
members.

Review and Outlook [Js a/J-male only attraction ?

A clouded window

In our editorial last week, we advocated open
discussion between students and the administration
concerning major university decisions.

At the heart of this idea is the need for the ad-
ministration to inform the students when such deci-
sions are being contemplated. The most recent pro-
blem in this respect is the proposed shortening of the
February Washington break.

The Faculty Executive Committee drew up the plan
about a month ago but put off its vote. Last Thursday,
the student members of the University Council voted
the proposal down 7-1. Monday the faculty as a whole
also voted the proposal down.

Although we are happy that the plan did not pass,
we feel that the outcome was not as important as the
manner in which it was decided.

The only opportunity for student opinion in this
decision was at the University Council meeting. Un-
fortunately, there was no notice that this question
would be taken up. Of course there were notices that
the Council would meet but it is unrealistic and im-
practical to think that students will go to every
meeting to see whether or not an important issue is
being discussed.

This lack of communication is dangerous and unfor-
tunately not without precedent.

The new curriculum requirements were passed
with a minimum of student input as were the changes
to the grade-point system. Student opinion is essential
to a fair discussion of these matters but for there to be
student opinion, students must first be informed

This is especially important in light of two decisions
facing the University as a whole: the need for a
Spring term and the more basic decision about
whether to remain all-male at the undergraduate
level.

Decisions made behind the student body’s back only
serve to create distrust toward the administration
despite its intentions. The window between the
students and the administration need not be clouded.

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at

comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The

the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Monday of the week they are to be run. This newspaper
observes current court definitions of libel and obscenity.

To the Editors:

Among any number of in-
cisive points in his column last
week, Stephen Matrazzo noted
an argument which deserves
some further consideration: ‘‘If
single-sex education is all that
makes this university unique,
what good is the university?”’

This is an essential question. Is
being all-male so important
that W&L’s quality . depends
upon it?

We have to begin by demon-
strating that W&L is a good
university. I will define a “good
university’’ as a place where an
education of excellent quality

Student cites Fiji merits

To the Editor:

Recently, the Student Ac-
tivities Committee (SAC) voted
to kick the fraternity of Phi
Gamma Delta here at Washing-
ton and Lee off campus. Their
decision came after two in-
cidents this year involving the
house, first a smoke bomb

Commentary
policy questioned

To the Editors:

In reference to ‘Faculty
Comment,”’ Nov. 3, p. 3, it
would seem that as a matter of
policy, all letters and comments
(other than editorial) published
in The Ring-tum Phi should be
signed if the paper is to be a
responsible forum of discus-
sion.

thrown into a Sigma Phi Ep-
silon party, and secondly the
removal of the Hampton and
Sydney mascot’s tail by pledges
during the recent game held
there. However, upon closer in-
spection of the circumstances
surrounding these incidents and
the rulings concerning similar
actions by other fraternity
houses on campus, it does not
appear that such a_ stern

measure was required.
I am a junior here at W&L,

and have just had the opportuni-
ty to witness the drastic im-
provements which Fiji has
undergone during these past
three years, changing from a
house with a flooded basement
and an exterior to match, to one
of the best maintained houses
on campus. They have gone
from a state of near bankruptcy
to one which is today financially

may be obtained. It is still dif-
ficult to determine whether
W&L is a good school since I
have no comparative ex-
perience at another school. But
over three years’ experience
here has led me to believe that
an excellent education may be
found here. The principal
reason for this, I feel, is not our
single-sex status, but, instead,
our size. Instruction here is
generally on a very personal
level. Many of the things we
take for granted are not avail-
able in larger universities. At
the University of Illinois, one of
the nation’s finest schools,
Chemistry 101 meets with 300 or
so students at 9 a.m. The lecture
is recorded and played back for
each hourly section during the
day. Here, we get back papers
graded by the professor, who
knows our names, who probably
notices if we blow off class, who
has office hours primarily to
speak with students. We don’t
even need an appointment’ to
speak to a dean. These instruc-
tors are, with few exceptions,
wise and learned men who have
chosen to teach first and to
research and write as a secon-
dary pursuit. They offer us an
excellent education if we want
it.

But do we? Are we interested

Matrazzo overlooked free choice

To the Editors:

Stephen J. Matrazzo’s column
in the Nov. 3 edition of The
Ring-tum Phi, presented one of
the most twisted and distorted
arguments concerning coeduca-
tion put forth to date. One need
not favor or oppose coeducation
to see the holes in his swiss
cheese argument. Matrazzo
comes to the conclusion that
Washington and Lee should
become coed in an effort to
broaden its horizons. He says
that the university is, ‘“‘geared
to a certain constituency...
uniform in background, politi-
cal beliefs, ethnic origin, taste
etc.” In a word, he calls the
university, ‘‘one dimensional.”

Mr. Matrazzo dismisses free
choice as a reason for W&L re-
maining single-sex by saying,
“if you want freedom of choice,
you’re free to go to Hampden-
Sydney, etc.”’ Well Mr. Matraz-
zo, if you want diversity, and
think you can find it, you are
free to go to UVa, Virginia
Tech, UNC, The University of
Florida, etc., etc. No one is forc-
ed to go to Washington and
Lee, Furthermore, if Hampden-
Sydney and other all-male col-
leges and universities accepted
your attitude of passing the
buck the choice of attending an
all-male school would no longer
be available. Mr. Matrazzo says
that we heard all the standard
arguments for and against
coeducation and, ‘‘everyone has
missed the point.’’ Unfortunate-

 

 

ly, he did not have a chance to

read the Phi’s in-depth 10-page
supplementary analysis of
coeducation that covers nearly
every aspect of the issue. Clear-
ly, Mr. Matrazzo has missed the
point.

Stephen Matrazzo refutes the
more common arguments for
and against coeducation by say-
ing that they are based on “‘in-
justice” and “‘tradition,” and
that these are “meaningless
subjective terms.” People feel
very strongly about traditions
and are often willing to fight for
them. As far as injustice is con-
cerned, perhaps Mr. Matrazzo
should consult a dictionary or a
thesaurus where he would find
that an injustice is a wrong.
Matrazzo claims that one
dimensionality pervades at all
levels and leads to conformity
both in and out of the class-
room. Furthermore, he argues
that one should “try really
disagreeing with a professor.”
Obviously, he thinks this cannot
or is not done. Perhaps Mr.
Matrazzo is afraid to oppose his
teachers, or perhaps he has
argued with them and used the
same type of faulty reasoning
he used in his commentary. In
either case, one can see why he
may find it impossible to “‘real-
ly” disagree with a professor.

Stephen Matrazzo argues in
favor of making W&L coed as a
step in the right direction
toward diversification. How-
ever, there is no guarantee, ex-
cept for the inclusion of women,
that coeducation would make

our university more diverse.
There is nothing to ensure that
the women would be from dif-
ferent political or ethnic
backgrounds than the men who
already attend. What we might
very well see, is men and
women of the same “dimen-
sion.” '

Mr. Matrazzo concluded his
article by saying “if coeduca-
tion passes in May, will those
declaring ‘better dead than
coed’ bless us with voluntary
euthanasia?” They may, but it
seems Stephen J. Matrazzo has
beaten them to the punch with
his commentary and committed
voluntary intellectual
euthanasia.

Grenadian policy dangerous, Handelman charges

‘We are fair game for everyone’

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

The American “invasion” of
Grenada was “‘a convenient op-
portunity for the military to flex
its muscles in a sure-win situa-
tion’’ and sets a dangerous
precedent for foreign policy
based on ‘‘potential’’ threats,
according to politics Professor
John Handelman.

“Is it a legitimate foreign
policy goal, to make the world
safe for democracy versus be-
ing safe for tourists? It seemed
our justification for the entire
operation was that 10,000 foot
runway and the potential for a
Cuban base there. Such a policy
of potential harm is danger-
ous,’’ Handelman noted. ‘Do
we not place ourselves as a
target since we have the poten-
tial to do harm to everyone? We
are fair game for everyone.”

In objecting to the policy of
potential for harm as a basis for
a policy judgment, Handelman
also sees other problems with
the Grenadian invasion. The
damage done to the United
States’ reputation as
democratic and freedom loving
is irreparable.

“I think we have to look at the
cost-benefit of the move. Ana-
lyze the cost to our international
reputation. For whatever gains
we made. The Security Council.
Everyone’ voted against the
United States except Great Bri-
tain, who abstained. We, of
course vetoed the resolution.
One has to worry about cost in-
curred. It is not equitable to the
benefit,’’ he said.

Supporters of the show of
military prowess note that
Grenada now has (or will have)
a stable, democratic govern-
ment. Such words are fodder to
Handelman’s argument.

“Promoting stability? That’s
a can of worms! Should stabili-
ty be a goal? I don’t know
whether stability is enough to
offset the costs. By promoting
stability in such a move, we are
denying the reality of change in
the world. If stability is our
goal, what about self-determin-
ation?’’ questioned Handelman.

The seemingly overwhelming
approval by the American
public and the Grenadian
population to the move also fell
prey to Handelman’s_skep-
ticism. Many backers of the
move note the willingness of the
native army to lay down its
guns and not fight the Marines
as evidence of an unpopular
government being forced upon
a people.

“Tl would lay down my arms
also in the face of the (US.)
Marines,”’ he said.

“What really bugs me,’’ he
continued, ‘‘is the censoring go-
ing on in reporting the invasion.
If it warranted being reportcd
that there were a number of
Grenadians who wanted — even
were thankful — for the inva-
sion then surely it warranted
being reported that there were

a number of Grenadians who
preferred us not to be there.”’
Similarly, Handelman is
angered by the Pentagon at-
titude that a ‘“‘minimum’’ of
lives were lost in the operation.

“IT have a student who said in
class, ‘Well, Marines are expen-
dable.’ Frankly, I don’t accept
that. Even if you lose one
soldier, it is unacceptable. I
realize you won’t hear that idea
from the President, with all his
emotional trauma,’’ Handel-
man noted.

“I don’t like the undercurrent
of indifference in the Grenada
policy, that makes it easy to be
heroic at a distance — to be an
armchair quarterback, but if
your son or daughter is there,
well that’s a different story. It
should have been addressed
earlier,”’ said Handelman.

Another fault Handelman
finds with the Grenadian inva-
sion is the implications it brings
about proceduralism and inter-
national law. The United States,
Handelman notes, was the
enraged party at the Interna-
tional Court of Justice when
Iran ‘‘thumbed its nose’’ at the
law in holding United States’
diplomats hostage. Now, the
United States is thumbing its
nose at International law, the
Rio Treaty (of the Organization
of American States) and the
United Nations’ Charter.

‘“‘We need to ask ourselves yet
another question. What are our
legitimate concerns? , this being
a threat at our ‘backdoor.’ As
though geographically it war-
rants our immediate attention.
We have 40,000 troops in South
Korea. We have troops all over.
What are the limits of our
American interests? Just

because they’re close geo-
graphically? What were they
doing to really threaten us?’’ he
asked.

“We find equipment for 4,000
troops, a rifle and a sidearm for
each. Does that really threaten
us? Are we afraid they’!] splash
up on Boca Raton and make
their way to Atlanta? Is that
really a threat? I’m worried,
real worried, if we perceive that
as a threat,’ said Handelman.

While he is eager to chew
apart the policy, he is slow to
provide substantive alternative
policies.

‘(Grenada’s neighbors) have
reason to be concerned, but at
the same time, I’m not entirely
sure that they should not have
done more themselves. They
could have asked us for arms.
We'll gleefully supply arms.
We'll gleefully supply advisers
to show them how to use the

arms. We could even have tried
a blockade,’ he noted.

“But that brings us all back to
potential. Was there really a
danger to the medical students?
or just a potential danger? I’m
not convinced the danger was
enough. You’ve got to go on
evidence. You can’t go on poten-
tial. We’re still issuing visas for
people to go to the Philippines.
Even the President won’t go
there,”’ he said.

“There is just greater poten-
tial in this for us to come out
smelling like a turd. There is no
potential for benefits. The costs
are real. The big risk is the in-
terim p.r. Who are we trying to
convince, ourselves’ or
others?,”’ he asked, going on to
answer his own question. ‘“‘We
do a good job of convincing our-
selves with the help of the
media, but we sure do a poor job
convincing others.”’

Questions arise about commentary

~ by SCOTT MASON
Coeducation has aroused
more debate on the Washington
and Lee campus than perhaps
any other issue in the last
decade. A lot of students feel

Reader’s
Advocate

 

 

strongly about the matter.
That’s evident from the number
of letters that have poured in to
The Ring-tum Phi. Students
have found an outlet where they
can vent their opinions. They
have something to say about
coeducation and aren’t afraid to
Say it.

Faculty opinion, on the other

hand, has been almost non-
existent. Students don’t really
know what professors think
about coeducation.

Last week an article under
the heading, “Dismissing the
Obvious Piffle’’ appeared on the
oninion page of the Phi. It was
written by a faculty member at
the request of Phi Chief Editors
Rick Swagier and John
Cleghorn. The professor didn’t
sign his name to the article,
because he was ‘concerned
about repercussions from the
administration,’ according to
Swagler.

Its been a long-standing pol-
icy of the Phi not to print let-
ters that aren’t signed, An
anonymous letter is_ risky
because there is no way of
checking whether it is true,
Swagler said. It could be
libelous. If it is, the Phi is
responsible.

The faculty member’s com-
mentary last week wasn’t sign-
ed. Why did the Phi decide to
print the unsigned article when
it refuses to print anonymous
letters?

In this instance Swagler and
Cleghorn asked the faculty
member to write the commen-
tary. They knew who the author

was. There was little risk in
Sts the commentary with-
ut the author’s signature since

they knew who to check with if
questions arose about the arti-
cle.

The Phi has received at least
one written complaint and
numerous vocal complaints
arguing that the unsigned com-
mentary shouldn’t have been
printed. But in this instance, the
Phi’s decision to run the article
makes sense. After all, the
Phi’s policy not to print
anonymous letters is based only

on avoiding legal trouble. There
was no such risk of libel when
the Phi printed the unsigned
commentary.

Scott Mason, the Reader's Ad-
vocate, operates on a separated
basis from the editorial board of
the Ring-tum Phi. His job is to
analyze the Phi's news coverage
and address any consequent ques-
tions.

“Wreck families, ruin homes
and scar bewildered children’

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE

I remember the day I decided
to give it up. It was a rainy day.
Cold. Dreary. A good day for
goodbyes.

I'd told myself it was not
abuse. I could stop if I wanted
to. I didn’t do half as much as
some. Not like ... well, I knew
the names. I.couldn’t hold a
candle to the real addicts. I
could handle it.

But then it got out of hand, for
me and for others. I saw its
results. It branded one student,
and then another, and yet
another. And it wasn’t just

students. I saw it wreck
families, ruin homes, scar
bewildered children. Daddy,

what happened to Mama?

I saw that it inevitably got the
upper hand, took command.
And it devoured all good things,
light and love and laughter.

So I quit. I’m through with it.
The Church knew: it must be
given no quarter. It’s always
wrong, no matter what it pleads
in its defense. So I quit.

No more gossip. Not a drop.

I've been gossipped about in

my time; and to. And God
knows I had passed it on. I
verified my sources. I was
discriminate. I checked for ac-
curacy, for witnesses. I careful-
ly distinguished mere rumor
from real scandal. I was
reliable. I was the AP wire for
the campus. Others might
break a story faster or tell a
livelier tale; but if you wanted
the inside track on fact over fic-
tion, you probably ended up

My View

asking me. So I have had some
part in the wrecking. I hope the
greater part came from others.
But that excuses nothing.
Gossip is a genteel form of
murder, so common in the com-
fortable classes that its basic
viciousness is overlooked. But

 

 

- murder it remains. True or

false, impartial or malicious,
hateful or merely indiscreet,
rumor is a ravening beast. It

must not be tolerated for an ins-
tant.

They say Gossip is a. woman-
ish vice. I doubt it. This place is
a ‘dark satanic mill’ of scandal.
If this. is a feminine trait, here
at least no coeducation is need-
ed to give us insight into the
psyche of women.

I was not, I know, the only or
even the worst practitioner of
this ancient dark art. I can
think of perhaps three saintly
folk above the practice. All
sorts and conditions of men do
it. We have the ladies beat on
this. The wildest tales of the
gossip that goes on in Anglican
women’s groups, southern la-
dies’ sodalities and the Junior
League, even if true, would pale
in comparison with the amount
of scandal mongered on this
campus in a slow week. It
shouldn’t be that way. I for one
am through with it, by God’s
good grace.

Quaecunque honesta .. What-
soever things are pure, what-
soever ... honest, think on these
things. There is really no ex-
cuse not to. Ever.

Read is re-elected as Commonwealth’s Attorne
ie

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Republican Beverly § C.
‘John’? Read defeated three
challengers Tuesday to win a
third term as Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Lexington and
Rockbridge County.

Read received 46 percent of
the votes cast in the election,
which drew a 73 percent turnout
in the city and 69 percent in the
county.

His nearest competitor,
Democrat Larry Mann, was 479
votes behind with 38 percent. In-
dependents Robert Joyce and
James Adams garnered 14 per-
cent and 2 percent of the total,
respectively.

In the wake of his victory,
Read promised citizens that he
would work ‘‘to preserve their
security, to keep their trust, and
to be fair and even-handed in all
matters involving our system of

“‘T have tried to do a good job
as Commonwealth’s Attorney
over the last eight years,’’ Read
said. ‘‘I hope people have ap-
preciated the work that I have
done during that time and I will
try to do a good job for the next
four years.”

“I said during the entire cam-
paign that I would continue to
operate my office in the same
way in the next four years that I
have during this term,”’ he con-
tinued.

“My actions involving pro-
secution, plea bargaining and
requests for jail time — all of

these features icve been the
same during the last tour vears
that they were during my tirst
term, and the people will see
that they won't change in the
next four years, either.’’

Read says that during a cam-
paign, he works to avoid ‘‘any
type of mudslinging or negative
advertising about’’ his op-
ponents. ‘‘I have chosen a dif-
ferent style of campaigning,”’
he said. “I campaign only on
positive points.

“Tm not a politician. I don’t
know all the nuances of political
campaigning. I believe in pos-
itive campaigns — not to distort
anything or take it out of con-
text.”’

Read said he was ‘very
pleased’’ that he took the City of
Lexington and thanked the
Washington and Lee College
Republicans and some of the
faculty members for their
assistance.

The prosecutor said he ‘‘can’t
think of any’’ other office he’d
like to hold. ‘I enjoy being the
Commonwealth’s Attorney, and
I enjoy serving the community
in that capacity.”

Republican Vance Wilkins
was elected to a fifth term as
the 24th District representative
to the House of Delegates by a
surprisingly large margin.

He handily defeated Demo-
crat Nanalou Sauder, a
Rockbridge resident, 59 percent
to 41 percent. His margin last
year over Mrs. Sauder was 37
votes out of over 12,000 cast.

Wilkins attributed the victory
to hard campaigning and fre-

Independent Union launches plans

by STEVE POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Weekend road trips, non-
party functions and weekend
bands in the Cockpit were
among several ideas suggested
for independent entertainment
at the first Independent Student
Union meeting last Thursday.

About 64 students as well as
Dean of Students Lewis G. John
and Associate Dean of Students
Michael A. Cappetto attended
the meeting where students
aired their opinions about the
need for and function of an in-
dependent union.

The meeting was the result of
initiatives taken by junior
Joseph Cadle and sophomore
Jim Sarle. Cadle and Sarle
spoke to the EC at its Monday
night meeting about the sugges-
tions made at the independent
union meeting.

“Bob Jenevein (EC presi-
dent) said they were valid ques-
tions,” Sarle said. ‘“‘He didn’t
feel that the EC could answer
them right on the spot.”’

Jenevein said that he and
Cadle will meet with the EC
subcommittee on independent
student affairs soon.

Sarle said he was impressed
by the turnout at the orginiza-
tional meeting.

“There were more than just
Joe and I running the meeting,”’
he said. Sarle noted that since
the meeting, an additional 15
students have come to him ex-
pressing interest in the union.

The co-chairmen’s next move
will be to send out a question-
naire next week. They said they
already have a list of students
who are interested in playing
winter intramural sports. A
bulletin board located near the
Cockpit in the University
Center will be used for an-
noucements concerning the
union, Sarle said.

The next meeting of the in-
dependent union will be in the
week following Thanksgiving
vacation and Sarle said that he
is hoping to have a faculty ad-
visory committee by that time.

‘They were overjoyed’

WGL grad injured in Grenada invasion says students

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Tuesday, Oct. 25, was a busy
day for Syd Farrar.

The 1980 Washington and Lee
graduate, a first lieutenant in
the 75th Ranger Battalion, took
off from Barbados on a C-130
transport plane and parachuted
into the Point Salines, Grenada,
airstrip before dawn that morn-
ing.

Farrar was leading a 35-man
platoon that was in the first
wave of American troops to in-
vade the tiny Caribbean island.
Less than a week before, the
assassination of Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop had led the
United States to believe Cubans

and Russians were intervening
in (Grenada’s) affairs.

President Ronald Reagan
decided that weekend to send
American troops into Grenada.

The airfield onto which Far-
rar jumped also concerned the
Reagan administration. Cuban
construction workers were ex-
tending the runway beyond a
length normally required for
the island. Many of those con-
struction workers were actually
Cuban soldiers.

Farrar discussed his role in
ihe invasion of Grenada during
a telephone interview _ this
weekend from Walter Reed Ar-
my Medical Center in Wash-

After clearing the airfield by
7:30 that morning, Farrar’s pla-
toon was assigned to secure the
True Blue campus of the St.
George’s University School of
Medicine, where several hun-
dred American students were
studying.

Farrar contacted two student
leaders at the school and told
them ‘‘who we were and that
there was nothing to be scared
of.”’

“They were overjoyed. They
were ready to get out of there,”’
Farrar added. ‘They had
figured they were under some
sort of threat. They were very
happy to see us.”

Later that afternoon, Farrar
was leading a small patrol try-
ing to locate other friendly
troops. ‘‘I stepped out into a
road and caught some rounds,”’
Farrar said.

“The guys just happened to
be there and I happened to be
there and they saw me before I
saw them,” added Farrar.

One bullet went through his
arm, breaking his humerus
bone into several pieces, and
then entered his lungs. Another
bullet ‘‘nicked” his hip.

Farrar said his arm was in a
brace and the tubes had been
taken out of his chest. ‘‘I’m feel-
ing pretty good right now,”’ he
added. He was listed in satisfac-
tory condition Tuesday.

Barring pneumonia or other
infection, Farrar said he should

to many Americans that Tues-

EC tries

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
spent a good portion of its
longest non-budgetary meeting
of the year Monday night clari-
fying its policy regarding the
signing of honor cards with
representatives of the law
school.

Last week, the EC had decid-
ed that upperclass law students
who did not sign honor cards
would not be allowed to vote in
the spring’s EC elections. First-

were happy to see Rangers

little bit stronger than what we
had expected.

“There were certainly other
elements that we didn’t think
were going to be there. We had
expected little or no_resis-
tance.”’

Farrar indicated that all the
Americans’ goals were ac-
complished and that the troops
had planned to stay only a few
days.

Asked whether he supported
the decision to invade Grenada,
Farrar said, ‘“‘Without a doubt. I
was ready to go. Everybody in
the battalion was ready to go.
We were fully supportive of
Reagan and the Chiefs of Staff
in their decision to do such a
thing.

“After the failure of the Ira-
nian hostage rescue mission,
American armed forces needed
to show that they were powerful
and that they could put forces
where they wanted to when they
wanted to.

“We did just that.’’

Farrar said he also supported
the decision not to allow media
representatives onto the island
until the fighting had moved
toward conclusion. ‘‘The media

tends to distort the actualities
and the facts,” he said.

“If it had got to the media, I
can assure you, we would have
had 10 times as many people
killed. I would have been scared
to death of the plans being leak-
ed somehow, and they (the
enemy) would be waiting for us
when we dropped out of the
clouds.’’

While at Washington and Lee,
Farrar, an English major, was
president of the Interfraternity
Council and Phi Delta Theta
and co-captain of the 1979 foot-
ball team.

“IT got a hell of a leadership
experience (at W&L),” he said.

“The leadership experience I
got there helped me many times
over in the military.”’

He joined the ROTC at W&L
for what he descirbed as ‘‘corny
reasons’’: his father fought in
World War II and Vietnam, and
Farrar viewed serving in the
armed forces as ‘‘a duty...I ow-
ed it to my country.”

Farrar said he has only one
regret about deciding to join the
ROTC: “I don’t get to see my
wife enough.”

to bridge gap

year law students normally sign
these cards upon matriculation,
as do freshmen, but ‘‘an over-
sight of EC’s in the past,’’ said
President Bob Jenevein, led to
the second- and third-year law
students’ never having signed
‘these cards.

Second-year law student
Bruce Poole, one of several law
students at the meeting, said
“It looks as though the com-
munication problem between
the undergraduates and the law
school has flared up again.”’

The law students expressed a

concern that the EC was ques-
tioning their honor, but Jene-
vein explained, ‘‘All we’re do-
ing is restoring our old prac-
tice.”

Senior law _ representative
Jim. Green had distributed
honor cards and an explanatory
letter to law students last Fri-
day. As of Monday, Green said,
60 to 70 signed cards had been
returned.

Robin Allen, a third-year law
student, said the problem may
have resulted from ‘a lack of

Washington break spared

Faculty nixes plan to trim holiday by three days

By COLE DAWSON
Staff Reporter

The faculty decided Monday
not to shorten the 1985 Washing-
ton’s Birthday break from five
to two days, in accordance with
a vote by the University Coun-
cil.

That proposal, for the 1984-85
calendar, was developed by the
Faculty Executive Committee,
which consists of ten faculty
and two student members.

The ’85 winter term would
have begun on Thursday Jan. 3,
instead of Jan. 7; and the
Washington break would have
begun after classes Wednesday
Feb. 13 and resumed the follow-
ing Monday.

The central idea behind the
changes was to make gradua-
tion a week earlier. Next year’s
graduation date, June 7, will
throw W&L students into the
summer job market much later
than most other schools.

The Faculty E.C. drew up the
proposal as an alternative to
what they believe might be a
detriment to some students’ job
opportunities. The shortened
break, they believe, could have
also been a viable time for Fan-
cy Dress.

The student members on the
University Council voted 7-1
against the proposed calendar.
According to junior UC repre-
sentative Marc Monyek, the
biggest complaint concerned
the shortened winter break.

The student representatives
felt the Washington vacation is
one that students need in order

to break up the harsh winter
term. Professors also use this
time to catch up on their
grading. It might also be dif-
ficult to arrange Fancy Dress at
this time because of conflicts
with the athletic department.
The Council believed that
many students would cut the
first two days of winter term

i a yg,

(Thursday and Friday) in order

to extend their Christmas vaca-
tion.

Monyek felt the U.C. mem-
bers should have been given
prior notice of the proposed
calendar so that more campus-
wide input could have been
brought into Thursday’s
meeting.

The proposed Honors and
Capstone courses were also
discussed by the University

Council. These would be team-

taught inderdepartmental
seminars, such as _ econo-
mics/sociology. They would be
taught by a professor from each
department.

The courses would be cross-
listed and would be offered for
credit in the appropriate ma-
jors.

Monyek commented that the
outline for these courses was a
bit vague but he felt they were a
good idea and should be geared
toward the spring term.

 

EC

your understanding about us
and our understanding about
you.”

“It’s definitely a problem of
communication,’’ she added.

Other students complained
that there was no legal distinc-
tion between signing honor
cards and obeying the honor
code while such a distinction did
exist between whether or not
one could vote.

The EC voted unanimously
for Green to word his ex-
planatory letter to indicate that
the EC has no doubts about law
students’ integrity. On an 11-1,
vote, with freshman represen-
tative Andrew Caruthers oppos-
ed, the EC also established the
policy of requiring the cards to
be signed before law students
could vote in elections. .

The EC also heard a report
from Joe Cadle and Jim Sarle of
the independent union regar-
ding that group’s first meeting
last Thursday.

Cadle said there was ‘‘a near-
ly unanimous strong interest
shown for weekend bands inthe

il, an ln,

Cockpit and/or non-party social
functions.”

Representatives of the Stu-
dent Activities Board pointed
out that previous weekend
Cockpit bands have not been
very successful.

‘“‘We feel our job is to provide
schoolwide functions for in-
dependents and _ everyone,”’
treasurer John Haywood said.
“We're not afraid to lose money
in some areas and make up for
it in others. We did some Satur-
day night bands last year and
the attendance has never been
good. We have to look at it on a
school-wide basis, not just one
group.”’

The EC decided to let its in-
dependent subcommittee, form-
ed last week and chaired by
secretary Len Howard, debate
ways of solving the issue. Cadle,
Clay Amott and Tim Schurr
were appointed as independent
representatives to that subcom-
mittee.

In other action, the EC:

Rohrig criticizes SAC decision

By TIM McCUNE
Staff Reporter

“It’s quite obvious that the
Student Affairs Committee
doesn’t want me to come back.”

Tom Rohrig made these com-
ments in the wake of the three-
year suspension given to him by
the Student Affairs Committee.

“I’m just trying to take it in
stride. They could have expell-
ed me, which would have looked
a lot worse on my record.”

The Student Control Commit-
tee, an all-student group,
recommended that Rohrig be
given a one-year suspension
beginning at the end of the
term. The Student Affairs Com-
mittee, a group comprised of
students and representatives
from the faculty, increased the
suspension to three years. The
Student Affairs Committee
automatically reviews all deci-
sions of the Student Control
Committee when an expulsion
or suspension is involved. _

Rohrig said that he believes
he knows why the Student Af-
fairs Committee was more
severe than the Student Control
Committee.

“There is a lot more support
and sympathy from the stu-
dents than from the administra-
tion. I could almost feel the
deans putting a nail in my cof-
fin.”’

Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘John’ Read has
repeatedly referred to Rohrig’s
case, telling how Rohrig ‘‘risk-
ed his life’’ to set up a major
drug dealer.

According to Rohrig, this
didn’t matter to the Student Af-
fairs Committee.

“‘They didn’t care about what
I did, turning state’s evidence.
They didn’t care about Sen-
sabaugh (the dealer). They
think that I’m a blemish or a
taint on the campus. They’re
wrong. They don’t know any-
thing about me, what I feel or
who I am. I try not to let what

people say about me bother
me.”

The three-year suspension
will, for all practical purposes,
prevent Rohrig from finishing
his education at Washington
and Lee.

‘I’m kind of upset that I can’t
graduate from here — it’s a
pretty fine institution. I think
being a Washington and Lee
grad would help me in more
ways than being a grad from
Central Michigan. I’m going to
apply to some state schools. A
lot of people will ask questions
and I’ll have to spill my guts.
Some places will say thanks,
but no thanks. I need a diploma

to do what I want to do, to be a
trader in the stock market. I’ll
just have to see what happens.”’

Rohrig is still awaiting
sentencing. While he was
attending classes he was releas-
ed from the Rockbridge County
Jail as part of a work release
program. As a result of the
suspension his work release

program has been discontinued. -

About the jail, Rohrig said
that “It’s pretty nice here.’’
Even as he said it, he did not
seem to believe his own words.
He puffed nervously on a
cigarette and glanced around
the room. Earlier he had men-
tioned that the dealer he had set

up was being held upstairs. The
jailer, overhearing part of the
conversation, remarked joking-
ly that he had better not say
anything bad about the jail or
they would stop being so nice to
him. Rohrig assured him that
he wouldn’t think of saying
anything like that.

Rohrig said he isn’t bitter
about what happened. “‘I’m still
extremely optimistic. In fact
I’m more optimistic and more
enthusiastic about the future
than I’ve ever been in my life. I
know I can still do a very com-
petent job — even though I’m a -
convicted felon. It doesn’t mean
I’m going to live in a gutter
from now on.”’

Dederick, Ham warn against
‘snowball effect’ of drugs

By KEVIN McCLATCHY
Special to the Phi

In a recent drug-awareness
program at Lexington High
School, two former Washington
and Lee students shared their
experiences with drugs with
local high school students.

Bill Dederick and Marc Ham
were among a panel of five
speakers to talk with the
students. Other participating
were Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence QO. Sutton and Com-
monwealth’s Attorney John
Read, who organized the pro-
gram and Rockbridge County
Sheriff's Department Capt.
Fred Spence.

Both Sutton and Spence each
gave brief talks on drugs and
their potential effects, but Ham
and Dederick were the ones who
carried the program. The stu-
dents were able to identify with
them more than with three
authority figures.

Dederick and Ham both re-
lated their own personal ex-

periences to the students and
pointed out the reality of the
consequences waiting for those
people who get involved with
drugs.

“I don’t want any of you to go
through what I went through,”
said Ham. “If I can keep just
one of you out of trouble by
relating my personal experi-
ences to you, then it’s (the pro-
gram) with it.”’

Ham also called drug involve-
ment ‘‘a road to self-destruc-
tion.’’ He explained that drugs
have a “‘snowball effect’”’ on a
person. He started with recrea-
tional use of drugs and wound
up dealing in large quantities of
drugs. ‘‘The danger of cocaine
is that psychologically once you
start, you want more all the
time,’’ said Ham. Ham added
that drugs are “not worth it,
they are illegal, bad for your
health, and they lead you to hurt
the people around you.”

Dederick’s talk was similar to
Ham’s. He also referred to the
‘snowball effect’? of drugs.

Both began selling drugs to sup-
port their own habits. “People I
cared about took a backseat to
drugs. My priorities were all
mixed up,’”’ said Dederick. “I
threw away a lot of things just
to get high. It was ridiculous,”
added Dederick.

Spence had nothing but praise
for Dederick and Ham as volun-
teers in the program. ‘‘Billy and
Marc were very anxious to help.
They showed a genuine interest
in doing something that must be
very difficult for them,’’ Spence
said.

Dederick explained why he is
involved in the program, ‘I
wouldn’t wish what I have gone
through on anyone. I have
learned a lot of valuable
lessons. I hope sharing my ex-
periences will prevent someone
from learning the hard way.”

Tom Rohrig, a Washington
and Lee student also serving a
jail sentence for drug-related
crimes, will also be involved in
the program.

sound, and the attitudes them-
selves have evolved from one of
constant disobedience and total
disregard for the house, into one
of deep concern and
brotherhood toward the frater-
nity. Perhaps the Fiji of my
freshman year could have
merited an action such as the
SAC has recently deemed
necessary, but certainly not the
fraternity which it has grown
into this year.

During my first year at this
school, there was a fraternity
kicked off campus, that being
the old Sigma Nu. The reasons
for that decision included a debt
of over $5000 to the university, a

in gaining a good education
(which has nothing to do with
grades) or a college degree?
Does W&L turn out gentlemen
or men with bachelor’s de-
grees?

These are important ques-
tions to consider. The essential
question of coeducation is
whether the introduction of
women would significantly
alter the answers to these ques-
tions and how they would be
altered. The argument, offered
by some of us, that the quality
of education would go down
with the introduction of the op-
posite sex, is hardly an argu-
ment of a gentleman. A gentle-
man finds unsubstantiated in-
sult distasteful
engaging in it. So far I have
seen no evidence that the in-
troduction of women would
cause W&L’s quality of educa-
tion to go down. Indeed, the
comparison in last week’s Phi
with Davidson seemed to in-
dicate that they have a better
quality of students entering

house which was incapable of
habitation, a destructive
nature, and a basic feeling that
their fraternity could no longer
contribute anything worthwhile
to this university and its frater-
nity system. And even with this
strong rationale, there was
much controversy over that
decision, and yet this year’s
SAC would casually kick a
fraternity off campus which in
no way resembles the old Sigma
Nu.

The Fraternity of Phi Gam-
ma Delta is financially sound
and in good standing with the
university; the house itself had
a new $10,000 roof put on this
summer and the interior looks

than we do. Nor have I seen
comparative evidence concern-
ing alumni support. Will W&L
grads not consider a coed W&L
their alma mater? Will they en-
courage their children to go
elsewhere (like Hampden-
Sydney)?

I say a good education can be
obtained here, but I still wonder
whether most of us who gradu-
ate have bothered to get one.
Have we taken advantage of the
education offered us? I think
not. For evidence, I offer a few
random examples of faculty
comment. But first an example
of the respect we give our pro-
fessors:

I have a course this term held
in an auditorium. Every class
has been attended by a majority
of the students as well as one
puppy dog. Don’t get me wrong,
he’s a great puppy. He wanders
all over the room, romps with
other dogs, has a jingling collar,
likes to chew up erasers, will go
outside and bring in the occa-
sional dead bird, and, in short,
provides an excellent diversion

They have been convicted of on-
ly two violations this year for
which a more than adequate
probation of eight weeks was
imposed. In addition, Fijis are
seen in every facet of university
life. They are active in ac-
tivities that vary from this
year’s Rush Chairman to the
head of the Cockpit, from
several dorm counselors to
numerous ROTC cadets. They
are active in most sports here at
W&L, including football,
lacrosse, wrestling, basketball,
baseball, golf, cross country,
fencing and soccer. In addition,
Fiji has maintained a cumula-
tive GPA above the combined
student body average for the
past three years as well as plac-

ing in the top six in IMs. And
one of last year’s valedictorians
and three all-ODAC players
were among those numerous F'i-
ji graduates that are constantly
bringing prestige to this univer-
sity. It is apparent from these
acheivements that Phi Gamma
Delta is indeed involved with, if
not an integral part, of this
university, and it is unfortunate
that the SAC would deprive this
fraternity of the good which it is
capable of offering.

However, I am concerned not
merely with the outcome of Fiji
in this battle, but with all of the
fraternities here at this univer-
sity. The new administration
has already expressed its inten-
tions of limiting the number of

fraternities which remain here
at Washington and Lee in order
to make the way for the propos-
ed plan of co-education some
time in the future, and if a
fraternity such as Phi Gamma
Delta can be kicked off campus
for these petty incidents, then
who will be next? I do not
believe that a handful of com-
mittee members and Deans
should be able to casually kick a
fraternity off campus because
of reasons which do not in-
herently demand expulsion, for
if they are allowed such folly,
then no chapter here at W&L is
truly safe from such a disaster.

from the topic at hand.

Three days a ‘veek, I sit in a
class which is renowned for its
rigors and taken mostly by
those required to do so for their
major. By force of habit, the
professor always opens the
class with a simple question
dealing with the day’s short
reading assignment. Once or
twice someone’s guessed the

assigned reading.’’

Another professor asked a
large 200 level English course I
was in last year what season
Frost’s ‘“‘Oven-bird”’ was set in.
(The answer is the third word of
the second line: ‘‘mid-
summer’’). However, no one in
the class would admit to know-
ing that. The professor replied
that the poem was set in

“I say a good education

can be obtained here, but...”’

 

answer with some clues and a
bit of prodding. Otherwise, the
professor grins and chuckles at
us. We grin back, relieved that
he, like most of the others, has
gone beyond indignation and
passed into an accepted amuse-
ment at the consistency of our
lack of concern and interest.
They say humor is at bottom
repetition.

Myth has it that another pro-
fessor, in search of advice from
a wiser elder in his department,
received as an answer to a
query on how to ensure student
preparation: ‘‘Not even
Yahweh Himself could make

the students at W&L do their

turkey in the oven for Thanks-

moments before noticing that
students were taking notes.

In a History seminar last year
(seminar, by common practice,
means a discussion-class), I
was ina class where a professor
asked for questions on the
assigned reading. When no one
offered any, he pushed further,
asking several students. He
gave the whole class a second,
final chance. No one had any.
He dismissed the class. We all
agreed he was in a bad mood
and would, we hoped be better
next time. He was. He didn’t
ask us for questions. -

Legend has it that a professor
was on the faculty committee
which recently came up with
the changed graduation re-
quirements. He described the
committee’s task as like “rear-
ranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic.”

A general disgust or genteel
amusement is how I feel the
faculty views our intellectual
abilities. Oh, we’re nice enough
chaps, all right. But the above
incidents are just examples and
not isolated ones. Why should
the faculty care? They are of-
fering us an education and few
of us bother to accept. Here is
the problem beneath the pro-
blem. What in our lifestyle
hampers us from accepting this
opportunity to be educated?
These are the things which the
administration ought to change.
If coeducation will bring us
brighter and more eager
students, then it will create a
better W&L. That is how the
Trustees ought to view the ques-
tion. Social life must be a secon-
dary concern to this decision.
No matter what sort of student
body W&L has — coed or not,
with frats or without them — it
will have a social life; all col-
leges do.

I find most of Mr. Matrazzo’s
points valid. I do not feel,
however, that we can place the
blame on the staff for unen-
thusiastic teaching. ‘‘The free
interplay of ideas and the ideas
of moral and _ intellectual
growth” aren’t stifled; there’s
nothing to stifle. On the con-
trary, when a student is in-
terested in the pursuit of
knowledge and wisdom, I think
the faculty is generally at first
astonished and full of sound ad-
vice and interest.

Finally, I close with an
acknowledgment that I speak
as someone who is guilty of
what I herein condemn. Well,
Mr. Matrazzo, I trust I am put-
ting myself in shoes not unlike
yours. We shall see what reac-

tions I get. Tom Connors

‘‘Autumn Leaves.”’

The quintet will be composed
of a percussion, trumpet/flugel

horn, saxophone, bass, and
piano.
Members of the quintet are:

—Barthe vanDoorn, a senior

from Herndon, Va., and a per-
cussionist with the Brass and
Percussion Ensemble;

—Jim Davis, a senior from

Shreveport, La., who is a soloist
on trumpet and flugel horn with
the W&L Jazz Lab Band;

—Whitney Gadsby, a junior
from Wilmington, Del., a sax-
ophonist with the W&L Jazz Lab
Band;

—Chris Fure, a freshman
from Berkeley, Cal., who plays
the bass and was second in the
state of California at the
Monterey Jazz Festival;

—Bruin Richardson, a
sophomore from Port Huron,
Mich., who accompanies the
W&L Glee Club on the piano and
has played in jazz ensembles in
the Port Huron area.

Trio will open concert series

The Burdette Trio will pre-
sent the first program in the
1983-84 Washington and Lee
Concert Guild series at 8 p.m.,
Monday, Nov. 14, in Lee Chapel.

Tickets are $4 for adults and
$2 for non-W&L_ students.
Season tickets for all four Con-
cert Guild performances are
still available at a cost of $12 for
adults and $6 for non-W&L
students. (Members of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty are admitted without
charge.)

The Burdette Trio is a
chamber ensemble whose
delicate blend of piano, cello
and violin has been hailed by
many critics not only for the
trio’s technical proficiency but
also for their understanding of
the genre.

The program for the Burdette
Trio’s W&L concert will be
Beethoven’s ‘‘Trio in E-flat Ma-
jor, Opus 1, No. 1,” ‘Three Noc-
turnes’’ by Ernest Bloch and

“Trio in B Major, Opus 8” by

Brahms. 2
The Burdette Trio came

together an as ensemble in the

summer of 1977 at the Meadow-

mount Schoo! of Music while
completing master’s programs
at the Juilliard School.

Since then, the trio has ap-
peared at Alice Tully Hall, the
Juilliard Theater in Lincoln
Center and the summer
chamber music series at Stony
Brook University, among many
other places.

Exhibit called ‘striking ’

By SCOTT PRYSE
Staff Reporter

The current installation in du-
Pont Gallery, ‘‘Extensions of
Time and Space,” by Edith
Frohock, has generated a great
deal of excitement and con-
troversy among W&L students
and faculty. Comments in the
Gallery visitor’s book have call-
ed Ms. Frohock’s work every-
thing from ‘‘a waste of time’”’ to
a “daring and provocative”
creation. Specifically, viewers
have called it ‘‘childish,”’ ‘‘ab-
normal’’ and even ‘“‘the work of
a monkey.’ At the same time
several admirers have seen it
as ‘“‘striking,” “intriguing” and
‘full of imagination.”

Whether or not people like
this exhibit is really not impor-
tant to the artist or the gallery.
The present installation is sup-
posed to give us something to
think about. Unlike a traditional
exhibit, this show invites, even
insists, that the viewer become
a participant. The idea behind
an installation is that the actual
space in the gallery should
become integral to the entire

work. Frohock chose to make
this exhibit an_ installation
because she enjoys the element
of chance that is introduced
with viewer participation. She
is also interested in time as a
dimension in the installation.

In an interview last week, the
artist stated that in the work
she tries to show ‘“‘the dif-
ference between time as an
abstract idea and time as the
experience of duration; one
having to do with symbolic ex-
pression, the other rooted in
physical fact.” On a table in the
gallery is a book called “Time
Screen” which has_inter-
changeable multicolored panels
to be manipulated by the viewer
to create unique and personal
visual images. This is linked to
the rest of the installation by an
electronic music piece.

The music, like the ‘Time
Screen,’’ is meant to enhance
the viewer’s experience of time
and space set up by the artist.
According to the composer,
Doug Carroll of Alabama,
“Pantheism I,” recorded last
summer, is ‘‘a tape piece that is
comprised of musique concrete,

ated sounds from traditional in-
struments. The diverse range of
sounds include students talking

in approximately 20 different
languages, various machines,
several types of animals and an
array of weather-produced
sounds. The electronically
generated sounds came from
synthesizers and tape effects.

The acoustically generated
sounds include cello, piano and
percussion.” The composition,
which was inspired by the pain-
tings, plays continuously in the
Gallery.

Frohock incorporated many
ideas from the Orient into her
work. The rhoplex. panels of
blue, red, white and black stand
for the ancient Chinese
discrimination of east, south,
west, and north, respectively.
‘‘Astronomer’s Bowl,”’ the plex-
iglass sculpture on the floor in
the center of the gallery, was
inspired by an observatory in
India. Its yellow base signifies
the harmony of earth and man.

For many people at Washing-
ton and Lee ‘Extensions in
Time and Space’’ is a new form
of artistic expression and due to
viewer response, duPont plans
to exhibit several installations
of this kind in the near future.
This show will remain in the
Gallery thru Nov. 18.

General comeback stuns CU ,22-21

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals clinched their fourth
consecutive winning season last
Saturday with a_ last-second
22-21 victory over the Catholic
University Cardinals.

The Generals drove 65 yards
during the last six minutes of
the game, scoring with eleven
seconds remaining on a seven-
yard pass from quarterback
Bobby Wilson to tight end Rob
Brown. Wilson then hit tailback
Gene Girard in the corner of the
end zone for the two-point con-
version and the victory.

Head coach Gary Fallon said
there was no hesitation in mak-
ing the decision to go for the win
rather than the tie. ““‘We’d come
too far on that drive to settle for
anything less than the win,”
Fallon stated.

The game was close the entire
way as the two teams traded
touchdowns throughout the
afternoon. Catholic got on the
scoreboard first when quarter-
back Tony Gallis hit Walt
Kalinowski for a_ six-yard
touchdown, giving the Car-
dinals an early 7-0 lead.

The Generals tied the game
midway through the second
quarter when strong safety Tim
Janyska picked off a Gallis pass
and returned it 22 yards to
paydirt. James White added the
point after, knotting the score at
7-7. Neither team could manage
another score before the half.

W&L took the lead at 14-7
when Gene Girard scored on a
nine-yard run with 4:20 remain-
ing in the third quarter. This
lead was short-lived, however,
as Catholic quickly answered
with a 25-yard Gallis to John
Hildreth touchdown pass that
tied the score at 14-14 with 1:54
left in the third quarter.
Catholic took the lead in the
fourth quarter when quarter-
back Gallis again connected
with Kalinowski, this time for a
10-yard score. After Mike Can-
non added his third PAT of the
day, Catholic led 21-14 with only
6:20 remaining to be played.

Starting at their own 35 yard
line, the Generals put together
the game-winning drive of 17
plays. Of these 17 plays, all but
one, the touchdown pass with 11
seconds remaining, were run-
ning plays.

“‘On that last drive, we simply
took it right at them. We didn’t
do anything fancy,” Fallon
said. ‘‘The offensive line took
control of the line of scrim-
mage, and our backs just ran
hard. That was a very good

underestimated them at all.’’

The Generals relied primari-
ly on their rushing attack
against Catholic, gaining 227 of
their 267 total yards on the
ground. Fallon praised his run-
ning backs after the game.

Surface’s blocking was sensa-

ceptionally well,” he added.

big defensive plays like Kelvin

end zone and Tim Janyska’s in-

Lebanon Valley is 2-6-1 on the
year and a relative unknown to
coach Fallon.

“IT don’t know beans about
this team, except that they have
played some tough teams,”
Fallon stated. ‘‘What I’m anx-
ious to see now is whether this
group will be content to have a
winning season or whether
they'll be hungry to get that
sixth victory against Lebanon
Valley. Based on what I’ve seen
thus far, I think I know the
answer. We'll be ready to

Girard, White
slash former
season marks

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

Three Washington and Lee
single season records were sur-
passed last Saturday in the
Generals’ 22-21 victory over
Catholic University.

Tailback Gene Girard
established new records for
both touchdowns and scoring
for one season. Girard scored
eight points (one touchdown,
one two-point conversion)
against Catholic to raise his
point total for the season to 68,
four more than the mark set by
Bob Funkhouser 24 years ago.
Girard also broke the single
season touchdown record, eclip-
sing Chris Cavalline’s 1981
record of ten by one score.

Girard has the chance to set
yet another record this Satur-
day against Lebanon Valley. He
has 854 yards rushing for the
year and needs only 75 yards
against Lebanon Valley to pass
the school record of 928 yards
set by Stewart Atkinson in 1979.
In addition, Girard could
become the first 1,000-yard
rusher in W&L history if he
gains 146 yards this Saturday. It
is worth noting that Girard has
accomplished these things play-
ing a nine-game schedule while
Atkinson and Cavalline set their
records during a _ ten-game
schedule.

The third record set last
Saturday belongs to place-
kicker James White. White had
two extra points against
Catholic, bringing his season
total to 24, without a miss, one
more than the record set by Bill
Devine, who was good for 23 of
24 attempts in 1981.

Four times a charm as
Polo stops Richmond, 7-4

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team won its third
consecutive Southern League ti-
tle last weekend by defeating
the University of Richmond 7-4
in the final game of the
Southern League Champion-
ships. The tournament was
played in W&L’s Cy Twombly
Pool.

The Generals, 23-9 on the
season, won all five of their
games in the tournament. In ad-
dition to defeating Richmond,
W&L defeated Lynchburg 24-2,
George Washington 12-6, Duke
10-8 and Virginia Com-
monwealth 11-7,

The Generals controlled the
Richmond game from the start.
W&L scored the first four goals
of the game. Richmond did not
score a goal until the second
quarter.

quarter, when a series of Spider
tallies reduced the Generals’
margin to 5-4.

W&L ended Richmond’s
hopes for victory by scoring two
goals early in the fourth
quarter.

Commenting on the Generals’
victory over Richmond, head
water polo coach Page
Remillard said, “They (Rich-
mond) came out flat.’’

Richmond had defeated W&L
three times this season before
losing to the Generals last
weekend. Explaining the
Generals’ victory, Remillard
said, ‘‘W&L championship
teams have always played well
at the end of the season.”

Coach Remillard cited
freshmen Dan Trice and
Charlie Groh for outstanding
play against Richmond. Trice
won a sprint and scored a goal
early in the second quarter.
Groh blocked a Richmond pen-
alty shot also in the second
quarter. “‘They were two guys

 

 

who stood out because we did
not expect them to,” said
Remillard.

Because they qualified for the
finals of the Southern League,
W&L and Richmond will par-
ticipate in the Eastern Region
of the NCAA Division I water
polo tournament. In addition to
W&L and Richmond, teams
from Brown, Navy, Slippery
Rock, Bucknell, Harvard and
the University of Massachu-
setts will participatc. The tour-
nament will be played this
weekend at the Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. The
Generals’ first game will be
against Slippery Rock on Satur-
day.

Concerning the Eastern
Region, Remillard said, ‘This
is the most balanced Eastern
Region that I can remember.”’
The top two finishers in the
Eastern Region qualify for the
National tournament which will
be played in Long Beach, Calif.

Five out of
eight ain’t bad

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

...It is one thing to win a close
football game. It is another
thing entirely to win the way the
Generals did last Saturday.
Just some facts for those of you
who were watching the Florida-
Georgia or Auburn-Maryland
games or were engaged in some
other equally trivial task rather
than having all attention focus-
ed on Wilson Field: First, the
teams were never more than a
touchdown apart. Second, the
final touchdown was the result
of an 18-play drive against the
best defense in the conference.
Third, three records were
broken by Generals during the
course of the afternoon. And
fourth, Gene Girard had anoth-
er typical day for him, as his
142-yard effort put him just 75
yards shy of another W&L sing-
le-season mark. It was not by
any means an expertly played
contest, but perhaps this lack of
perfection is simply a reflection
of how evenly the two teams

played each other. Above
everything else, one thing
stands clear about this football

Time out...

team. When concentrated pres-
sure mounts, they have been
able to rise to meet it. The
Generals faced and conquered
do-or-die situations both last
Saturday and in the early
season 28-21 victory over R-MC.
Frankly, I don’t wee any other
ODAC team capable of replica-
ting such feats. The bottom line
is that W&L has the best team in
the conference. It’s just that it’s
been shown only five times this
season, instead of eight...
....More sports notes from the
colonnade. If Mr. Girard goes,
over 1,000 yards for the season,
an achievement surprisingly
not out of the question, he
deserves unanimous All-Ameri-

Coach Miller also noted that
Roanoke appeared the stronger

that.”” Coach Miller was not

Lex High grid coach center of controversy

By PAULCLARK
Staff Reporter

The question of the over em-
phasis on athletics in high
school education has hit close to
home.

Chaos that threatens to split
Lexington High School, and
possibly even the city, has
erupted around Lexington
High’s football team. The con-
troversy stems from. the
suspension and reinstatement
of head football coach Ron
Pyles, and from reports that he
has assaulted several of his
players.

The issue has been evolving
for some time but began to take
on steam back in August, when
Lexington High School hired a
football coach who was to be the
savior of the team. Two weeks
later, the coach quit his posi-

tion, citing ‘‘personal pro-
blems”’ as the reason for his
departure.

Later that month Ron Pyles,

the sixth coach in seven years,
was hired so Lexington could
‘eld a team this year. Little
background checking was done
because of the urgency of the
situation. Said Jerry Darrell,
the W&L food service director
and a man with a genuine in-

terest in Lexington High School,
‘“T heard nice things about
him...but shortly thereafter
problems arose.”’

After the second or third
game of the season, Lexington
assistant coaches Doug Chase,
a W&L alumnus, and Dave
Melton asked to see the prin-
cipal of the high school, Glen
Stark, so they could voice some
of their concerns about the way
the football team was being run.
Stark then decided that their
allegations against Coach Pyles

 

 

SAFEWAY

were serious enough to require
a meeting between Coach
Pyles, assistant coaches Chase
and Melton, principal Stark and
school superintendent Jim Jay.

At that meeting Chase and
Melton voiced their grievances
before Jay, after which Jay
suspended Pyles on the spot,
stripping him of all duties as
teacher, coach and athletic
director. Jay also directed
Chase and Melton to take over
the football team and called for
a meeting of parents and foot-
ball players that evening.

The meeting that night
resembled a kind of ‘‘witch
hunt,’ said Darrell. ‘There
were two camps...a pro-Pyles
camp and an anti-Pyles camp.”
According to Darrell most of
the parents were ‘‘stunned”’ to
find out the nature of the allega-
tions and the action Jay had
taken against Pyles. ‘Many of
us were confused as to what was
happening,’’ added Darrell.

Principal Stark stated that he
fully supported the action Jay
had taken and furthermore, had
recommended it. ‘‘The meeting
turned into a shouting match
—it really got wild... people
screaming at each otner. wvar-
rell recalled. ‘‘This has turned
into a very serious matter.”

When the problem gained

parents of the high schoolers
called for an executive session
on the matter. In the hearing,
Coach Pyles was questioned by
the board and the parents were
allowed a five-minute appoint-
ment to voice their concerns.
The meeting lasted from 8 p.m.
until 3:30 a.m., when the board,
chaired by Mac Wilkerson, a
businessman who runs Leg-
gett’s, overruled the decisions
of Stark and Jay and reinstated
Pyles.to his duties.

 

**T heard

nice things
about him...

but

shortly thereafter

problems arose.”

 

However, during that hear-
ing, Stark was never called to
testify before the board. “And
that,”’ says Darrell, ‘‘is a ques-
tion I and a lot of people would
like answered.”’

The Committee for Joint Con-
trol of Lexington High School is

Shortly after being re-
instated, Pyles said he planned
to resign immediately after the
last football game Nov. 4. Since
that time, however, Pyles
seems to have changed his
mind. He has distributed a list
of demands that will have to be
complied with if he is to stay.
Some of the demands include
the termination of some peo-
ple’s jobs. In addition, he wants
to answer only to the County
Superintendent.

Pyles’ supporters have sug-
gested that Stark be removed as
principal of Lexington High.
This proposition has upset the
teachers at the high school,
because in the words of Darrell,
many feel “‘Stark’s a hell of a
good man.”’

The current situation offers
many questions. What exactly
did Pyles do to his players?
Why was his suspension over-
ruled without regard to the
testimony of the school prin-
cipal? Why is he presenting a
list of demands so that he is
answerable only to the county
superintendent? Is _ football
more important than the
smooth running of a school and
its academics?

Werner’s fifth shutout gives soccer 8-5 mark

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team finished the season on
a winning note Saturday on
Wilson Field with a 2-0 victory
over Emory University of
Atlanta, giving the Generals an
8-5 final record.

The shutout victory was the
fifth of the season for junior
goalie Jay Werner, a transfer
student from St. Louis Universi-
ty.

Werner will return next
season with his entire defense
intact, as the Generals lose only
two seniors to graduation, for-
ward Roland Simon and mid-
fielder Ted Petrides, both four-
year lettermen.

“I don’t know if you ever get a

 

guy like Roland,’”’ commented
head coach Rolf Piranian.
“Both losing Roland and Teddy
will be a great loss. We’ve
got some holes to fill.’

Simon finished his soccer
career at W&L with 23 goals and
12 assists, putting him second
on the all-time assist list here,
despite being hampered by in-
jury much of last year.

“Among others, I’d be most
disappointed if Roland doesn’t
at least make All-South this
year,’’ said Piranian. ‘‘I say ‘at
least’ because I think he’s an
All-American.”

Against Emory, Simon’s shot
with five minutes left led to Eric
Obeck’s first goal of the season
when the Eagle goalie
mishandled the ball, sealing the
2-0 victory. Earlier Gary

Clements notched his third goal
of the season off an assist by
Mark Sullivan.

“T think it was a great year
for us,’”’ noted Piranian, whose
eight-year record at W&L now
stands at 46-58-6. ‘‘We lost six
players to graduation from last

year and we almost had as good
a season.”” W&L was 8-3-2 last
year.

The team voted the co-
captains for next year to be
junior Rob Coleman, co-captain
along with Simon this season,
and sophomore Billy Holmes,
who finished the season with
seven assists, tying a school
record, and five goals.

Piranian cited the 2-1 upset
victory over Messiah, ranked
fourth in the nation in Division
III at the time, as one of the

high points of the season. ‘They
haven’t lost a game since we
beat them,”’ said Piranian.

The Generals’ 8-5 record
almost earned them a bid to the
NCAA Division III playoffs. ‘“‘If
we had not lost that Radford
game we would have been se-
lected,” said Piranian. W&L
lost to Division II Radford, 3-2,
in overtime on Nov. 1, after
holding a 2-1 lead going into the
final two minutes of the game.

Although he considers the
season a success, Piranian has
one lament as coach. “‘Of all the
fine things we’ve done, we’ve
never won the conference since
I’ve been here.”’

The 1974 W&L graduate noted
one of the reasons for the lack of
success in the conference is the
need to schedule conference

games during midweek, to re-
duce travel on school days. Of
the six midweek games this
season, three were conference
matches and four were defeats.
Four of the Generals’ five
defeats and 13 of the 16 goals
scored against them came from
Tuesday or Wednesday games,
when players take the field as
little as an hour after sitting ina
classroom.

“That’s been a problem ever
since I’ve been coaching here,”
said Piranian. “I’ve _ tried
everything,” including having
the school psychologist try to
help the team make the transi-
tion from school work to soccer.

“When a lot of other schools
have a game on a school day,
they just blow off classes that
day” added Piranian.

weekend. Let’s just say he’s
making a habit of being in the
sports headlines of The Ring-
tum Phi...Over at the pool, it
seems to me that I remember
Coach Page Remillard saying
something about peaking for
the Southern League Champion-
ships, if only politicians’ pro-
mises were as true...
...Checking the happy na-
tional sports scene, there is this
glorious tidbit: There was a
conference on women’s ath-
letics in the nation’s capital
over the weekend. One major
topic of discussion was the idea
proposed by one Billie Jean
King that until women and men
compete on an equal basis,
women will not be able to reach
their athletic potential. Huh?
Look Billie Jean, men and
women are different, not une-
qual. You cannot equate the
athletic field and_ the
workplace; and thereby justify
equal competition. No, Billie
Jean, to equate men and women
on the athletic field is to deny
their respective novelties on
that field, something that I

don’t think we need or can af-
ford to deny. (C’mon BJK, Olga
Korbut and Kurt Thomas squar-
ing off in the floor exercise just
doesn’t make it with me.)...

..Our man from Jersey has
returned from a week’s absence
because of lack of interest
(mine, not his). About tonight’s
tete a tete in Vegas, the Prince
of Prophetdom has these words
of wisdom: ‘Hagler will win.
Hopefully, Duran will live.”
Should Mr. Duran disprove this
wisdom, the Prince’s remains
will be on display in the Phi of-
fice...Not meaning to step on
the Prince’s turf (heaven for-
bid), but don’t be surprised if
you see the Steelers and the
Redskins in Tampa Bay come
mid-January...

deserved PR for the radio

this season. You can have your
