Undergraduates oppose mak-
ing Washington and Lee a
coeducational institution by a
nearly two-to-one margin, anda
majority is strongly opposed to
such a change, according to a
poll conducted by the Executive
Committee.

The results of Friday’s poll
show that 61.3 percent of the
students responding were
against coeducation, while 36.3
percent said they would favor
it.

Of those, slightly more than
half (50.3 percent) were strong-
ly opposed to admitting women,
while 26.7 percent were strongly
in favor of coeducation.

‘These numbers tell me that
students do not want coeduca-
tion — period,’’ EC President
Robert C. Jenevein said.

“If you look at the two ex-
tremes in the response choices,
you see that some people really
want coeducation, and some
really don’t. Twice as many
people really don’t as really
do,”’ he said.

“Long ago, the EC came out
unanimously against coeduca-
tion,’ Jenevein continued.
‘“‘Now we know the students are
against coeducation, and that
enables us to take much more
definitive steps toward express-
ing student views.

“This gives us more credibili-
ty. We can now be responsive,
as well as responsible.”’

The number voting was 798,

or 59 percent of the undergradu-

ate student body.

That’s a better turnout than
we've gotten in any election,”’
said Jenevein. ‘‘It’s five or ten
points higher than anything
we've gotten before.”

The poll, which was ad-
ministered by sophomore EC
representative James A. White
Jr., consisted of four questions,
three of which were multiple
choice.

Jenevein said computer cor-
relations will be run on the
responses to help the EC inter-
pret the data.

“This will show us the validi-
ty of the trends we think we’ve
identified, and help us to locate
new ones,” he said.

The first question simply ask-
ed if students ‘‘feel W&L should

become a coeducational institu-
tion.”’

The second asked if re-
spondents ‘‘feel coeducation
would improve W&L as an
academic institution.”’

Responses showed that 50.3
percent said coeducation would
not or probably would not
benefit the University, while

Lexington, Virginia

42.4 percent thought it would or
probably would help.

The third question asked
students how committed they
were ‘‘to the traditions and
ideals of W&L.”’

Nearly 60 percent said they
were ‘‘very committed’’;
another third said they were
‘‘somewhat committed”’; 4 per-

President John D. Wilson said
that he has decided to create a
‘‘free-standing’’ computer
science department at W&L.

Wilson made the decision in
response to a report issued by a
faculty committee, which
recommended W&L add a com-
puter science major to the cur-
riculum. The decision as to
whether the computer science
major would be part of the
mathematics department or
controlled by an independent

 

department was made solely by
Wilson, he said.

The faculty as a whole must
approve the curriculum and
degrees, however, Wilson said.

The committee’s report
recommends that both a B.S.
and a B.A. degree in computer
science be offered at W&L. The
B.A. degree would require
fewer credits and would make it
easier for students to double
major in computer science and
a non-science major.

puter science and a non-science

cumulating the number of

degree,’’ the committee
reported.

Fifty credits of work would be
required to receive the B.S.
degree in computer science.
The B.A. degree could be earn-
ed with a minimum of 27 credits
in computer science plus two
additional math courses and
three additional credits from
300-level courses in either
physics, computer science or
mathematics, according to the
committee’s proposal.

ows 60% opposed to coed

cent said they were ‘‘not very
committed”’; and only 18 voters
out of 798 (2.3 percent) said they
were “not at all’? committed.

White said there was ‘‘a
definite trend”’ in the relation-
ship between an_ individual’s
response to the first two ques-
tions and how he answered the

third.
The fourth, an open-ended

question, asked students to “‘list
in order of their importance to
you, those traditions and ideals
of W&L.”

Although responses to that
question have not yet been
tabulated, White said the most
frequent response was ‘‘the
honor system.”

The poll was designed in con-
sultation with sociology Pro-
fessor David R. Novack, who
has supervised previous
coeducation polls at W&L.

“If the majority of students
are opposed to coeducation at
Washington and Lee, I think the
trustees should know about it,’’
Novack said.

Novack identifies himself as

‘‘an advocate of coeducation.’

White says the questions were
meant to be ‘‘flexible,’’ with ‘‘a
wide range of answers’’ offered
to the three multiple choice
questions.

Review and Outlook

Has EC thought ?

The Executive Committee has sometimes been ac-
cused of forming too many subcommittees, of taking
too much time to make decisions and thus of being
largely ineffective at representing student opinions.

A decision the group made this week, though,
perhaps would have benefited from further study. We
refer to the EC’s unanimous vote to recommend
that faculty members require their students to wear
ties.

Whether this policy will decrease student apathy —
which seems to be its purpose — and whether the
faculty will heed the EC’s vote are questions that can-
not yet be answered. Indeed, the wearing of ties by
students might prove to be a good idea.

This decision appears to have been made, though,
with little opportunity for comprehensive study. No
subcommittee was formed, and the only student opin-
ion apparently taken into account was that of the
students in the EC room Monday night.

A subcommittee should have been formed to in-
vestigate student apathy and the possibility of re-
establishing some W&L traditions. Previous subcom-
mittees on such problems as open exams have proven
effective; by talking with faculty, administration and
students, this subcommittee could have developed
some concrete proposals for thwarting student
apathy.

In this way, students would have had an opportunity
to express their opinions regarding student apathy in
general and the wearing of ties in particular.

When EC President Bob Jenevein appears before
the faculty Feb. 6 with the EC’s recommendation, he
purportedly will be representing student feelings on
the issue. In this case, he actually appears to be
representing the feelings of only 10 other students
—the rest of the EC.

Only by taking the time and effort to consider all
possible student reactions to any decision can the Ex-
ecutive Committee be truly representative of the stu-
dent body.

Letters to the Editors

IU complaints disputed

To the Editors:

I’ve always hesitated and
usually refrained from respond-
ing to criticisms of the Ex-
ecutive Committee that appear
in the Phi, feeling that I should
wait for the most destructive
and ill-founded criticisms. Well,
I think they appeared last week
concerning our treatment of the
“Independent Union.’’ In one
article, one commentary, and
one letter, the IU was portrayed
as an oppressed victim of a
fraternity-dominated student
body and student government. I
particularly want to answer the
letter:

1. Mssrs. Cadle and Sarle, the
self-appointed co-chairmen of
the IU, feel they are entitled toa
portion of the $2000 in the EC
funding account because they
are a new group. But as they
themselves pointed out in the
EC meeting, they may not be
around next year or the next.
This new group may soon be a
group of the past. If a new
Camel Watchers Club asked for
several hundred dollars, I
suspect our reaction would be
the same.

2. Mssrs. Cadle and Sarle
think the students who belong to
the IU are entitled to ‘‘see their
money (student tax) used by an
organization in which they par-
ticipdte.’’ I challenge them to
name one organization where
they are not allowed to par-
ticipate.

3. When comparing them-
selves to the Student Associa-
tion for Black Unity, perhaps
the IU should be more realistic.

4. The co-chairmen claim
representation of 40 percent of
the student body. That rests on
one very inappropriate assump-
tion — that all independents
want to have something to do
with the IU. I have personally

encountered many _indepen-
dents who chuckle at the IU,
and only two who take it
seriously. There is no question
that most independents think
they have better things to do
with their time and money.

4. Finally, the leaders of the
IU claim no objection to charg-

ever made to approach the
SAB. Instead, the IU leaders
showed up at an EC meeting
and presented a request for
over $600 including $100 of an-
ticipated long distance
telephone service; $220 for an
IU newsletter; $80 for mailings
to freshmen; etc.

 

‘IT have personally

encountered many independents

who chuckle at the IU...’

 

ing $4 or $5 per member, but
complain that they will need
much more. The Rugby Club
charges about $40 a member,
the Fencing Club about $75 per
man. And fraternity members
pay dues of around $50 every
month. The EC will again act on
its belief that real interest will
generate real income. I do not
expect the IU to collect any
dues.

I’m not going to go on and on
about this, but I should remind
our critics that the EC formed a
subcommittee on the problems
of independents before the IU
was formed. The ‘‘Reader’s Ad-
vocate’’ commentary warned
against our prejudice toward in-
dependents, but I’m afraid that
was an unnecessary precaution
and out of place in a column
designed to criticize the

newspaper.

Furthermore, the EC sub-
committee including several in-
dependents, directed Mssrs.
Cadle and Sarle to consult the
SAB about any changes the IU
thought were needed. What hap-

pened? Nothing! No effort was

The question students should
be asking is not ‘‘Why was the
EC so harsh with the Indepen-
dent Union?”’ but ‘‘How can the
IU expect any portion of the stu-
dent tax?”’

The Executive Committee
still solicits any suggestions for
improving the W&L experience
for independents.

Tradition includes participation

To the Editors:

The attendance at last week’s
Founder’s Day Convocation
was an embarrassment to the
University; I counted fewer
students in attendance than
faculty and guests. Yet every
member of the W&L student
body should have been present,
not only to celebrate our found-
ing, but also to honor the in-
itiates into ODK and to hear
President Wilson’s speech. The
Founder’s Day-ODK Convoca-
tion is one of our greatest tradi-
tions. (Indeed, the ODK order
was founded at Washington and
Lee.) It seems to me that all
arguments against coeducation
from the standpoint of preserv-
ing tradition lose their power if
no one is going to participate in
the tradition.

A similar phenomena oc-
curred Monday night at the
delegate sign-up for the 1984
Mock Convention, It too was

poorly attended. The Mock Con-
vention, like Founder’s Day and
ODK, is one of our greatest
traditions, something we talk
about when discussing our
great heritage. There are a lot
of people at various levels in the
Mock Convention who are work-
ing hard in order to ensure its
success and carry on its tradi-
tion. However, their hard work
will be for naught if no one par-
ticipates, or if participation is
last minute and shallow.

Those who talk about Wash-
ington and Lee’s tradition (as if
they are a part of it) and yet do
not participate in it are, in my
opinion, hypocritical. It is easy
to talk and point, it is another
thing to act. Many people have
noted a general sense of apathy
among the student body at
W&L; the poor attendance on
Founder’s Day and at the
delegate sign-up only serve to
further this perception. If we
really wish to preserve tradi-

tion at W&L, verbal reverence

alone will not suffice; rather,
we must all take part actively.

Low ODK turnout sparks apathy complaints

By MIKE ALLEN

Low attendance at last Thurs-
day’s combined Omicron Delta
Kappa and Founders’ Day
ceremonies has_ sparked
criticism of students’ apathy
and lack of regard for tradition
from faculty, administrators,
and student leaders.

On Jan. 12, Dean of the Col-
lege William J. Watt sent a
letter to the professors telling
them that ‘‘all students and
faculty are asked to attend.”

Coed poll results

(continued from page 1)
“‘We wanted the bare bones of
the issue,” he said. ‘‘We wanted
to keep it as short as possible
while still touching on all the
basic issues.”’

“This poll is a definite indica-
tion of student opinion,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘The turnout shows
that. Everybody really cares
about it.”

EC Vice President David C.
Judge said he thought that
“while a number of polls have
been taken in the past, this is
the best indication of student
sympathies because it was
taken while the students were
informed, aware and concern-

On Jan. 16, Executive Com-
mittee President Robert C.
Jenevein reminded people of
the event, and ‘‘encouraged all
students to attend the ODK-
Founders’ Day convocation.”’

In keeping with tradition, the
administration shortened after-
noon classes, providing a free
period of time for the
ceremonies.

The result, on what would
have been Robert E. Lee’s 177th
birthday, was only a handful of

students aside from those being
“tapped” and an Evans Dining
Hall full of empty seats.

“Don’t lose your capacity for
outrage,” . Said politics Pro-
fessor Delos D. Hughes. “‘I only
believe it because I’ve seen it so
many times before.”’

‘I was embarrassed for the
University to be attempting to
honor people and have the at-
tendance as sparse as it was,”
said Frank Parsons, executive

 

‘“‘We’ve seen more tension in
the student body on the issue at
this time than ever before.”’

Jenevein said he also was
pleased with the results of the
EC undertaking.

“We got a lot of criticism for
the last poll. Thanks primarily
to the publicity which preceded
this poll and James’ efforts,
I don’t expect any valid
criticism of this one.”’

White was ‘‘surprised that the
turnout was as high as it was’’
because of the cold weather and
the time required to fill it out.”

According to Jenevein, all
three polling places were

manned at all times, and White
said the people at the polls were
instructed to encourage pas-
sersby to vote.

“That really helped in the
turnout,” White said. ““We got
them torecruit people to vote.”

Politics department chair-
man William Buchanan, who
wrote the text ‘Understanding
Political Variables,’’ said this
turnout probably gave an ac-
curate reflection of student sen-
timent.

“The problem you have is
whether those who turn out are
representative of those who
don’t,” he said. ‘Obviously
those who are most interested

President Wilson said he
‘“‘would have been pleased to
see more students there.”’

“I think we could do more to
support one another, whether
it’s the basketball team, or
students in recital, or Contact,”
he said.

“We miss something real
when we miss the opportunity to
come together, especially when
that is to celebrate what I have
come to call the great heroes of
this place...

“Whether we know it or not,
we owe a great debt to the
founders of Washington and
Lee.”’

Chapter V, Section 3 of the

Bylaws of the University says ,

Founders’ Day ‘‘shall be
observed annually, forever,
with appropriate com-
memorative exercises...

“There shall be a suspension

of all lectures and ordinary ~

University exercises on
Founders’ Day...”

Despite that requirement,
classes are no longer cancelled
on Jan. 19, and Parsons
suspects that attendance would
be even less if they were. ‘At

least now people are on the
Hill,” he said.

At one time, attendance was
not optional.

Through 1969-70, the Catalog
said that a student ‘‘is required
to attend” certain ‘‘compulsory
assemblies.”

From. 1970-71 to the present,
the Catalog says that a student
“is expected to attend.”’

Parsons said the change was
made during the time ‘‘we
thought we'd have a hard time
requiring students to do
anything around here.

“Student attitudes were such
that they were perceived by the
administration as being anti-
establishment. The inclination
on the part of a lot of colleges,
and I think Washington and Lee
participated in that, was back-
ing off from certain re-
quirements.”’

EC calls for ties; exam proposal delayed

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night to ask the
faculty on an individual basis to
require students to wear re-
spectable clothes, including
ties, toclass.

But final approval of the open
exam policy was delayed a
week because the entire pro-
posal had not been typed.

The questions of students’
wearing ties to class came dur-
ing a discussion of student
apathy in general. Also discuss-
ed, but without any action
taken, were proposals to com-
bine athletic events and social
functions, publish a ‘‘Blue
Book” of Washington and Lee
traditions, re-establish .a
Boosters’ Club and reaffirm the
- speaking tradition.

' Junior representative Cole
Dawson noted that even if only
60 percent of the faculty re-
quested their students to wear
ties, nearly everyone on the

 

campus would have one on.
“There will be enough people
with ties so that it will become
accepted,’’ Dawson predicted.
Vice president Dave Judge,
who has taken several classes
with Dr. J.D. Futch, who re-
quires ties, said, ‘I’ve found

‘that kids who don’t take it

seriously are few and far be-
tween.”

Jenevein will make his pro-
posal, which was approved
unanimously by the EC, to the
faculty during its Feb. 6
meeting.

Earlier in the meeting, some
infighting between Jenevein
and Secretary Len Howard sur-
faced.

Jenevein first asked Howard
to get the EC minutes posted on
campus sooner. Jenevein said
the minutes of last week’s
meeting hadn’t been posted in
several places until a week
later, and that two items — an-
nouncements of the ODK Con-
vocation and the coeducation
poll — were dependent upon the

minutes being posted.

Then, Howard had typed a
cover letter to Dean Atwood
and Dawson’s nine-point open
exam proposal for the EC to ap-
prove. Jenevein first questioned
several editing changes
Howard made and then chastis-
ed Howard for not typing
another page dealing with the
specific logistics of how exams
would be distributed.

“T want to know why the ex-
tent of the proposal was not
typed up,” Jenevein said. .

Howard said he thought the
EC still had to approve the idea,

* but Jenevein said the idea was

approved last week, and the
logistics needed to be approved
this week.

The issue was tabled for a
week, and Dawson volunteered
to type the rest of the proposal.
After the EC approves the pro-
posal, the Faculty Executive
Committee must make a
recommendation to the whole
faculty.

The Faculty EC, though,
meets on Monday afternoons
and thus will not have an oppor-
tunity to consider the open ex-
am proposal before the next

Also Monday night, the EC
cleared up its budget misunder-
standing with the Student Asso-
ciation for Black Unity as SABU
President Ron Magee agreed to
spend all of the EC’s $1,500
allocation on the SABU ball. A’
budget report presented by
SABU last week showed pro-
jected expenditures of $750 for
the ball and $750 for.a speaker.

sure that organizations spend

EC clashes with police over evidence

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Lexington police have issued
warrants for the arrest of a
former Washington and Lee law
student on 18 felony counts.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said that a black male
from New York City is charged
with the forgery and uttering,
or passing, of nine fraudulent
checks.

“I suspect he is a former
Washington and Lee student,”’
Sutton said. The police chief
characterizes the man as “a
fugitive.”

‘‘We understand he was in
Lexington up until a few days
ago,”’ he said. ‘‘He was living on
University grounds.”

His name has been entered in

Grand jury subpoenas

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

The special grand jury in-
vestigating local drug distribu-
tion has asked the university to
release certain files for use in
the investigation.

‘There have been some docu-
ments subpoenaed, and we're
not sure yet of our response,”
said Dean of Students Lewis G.
John.

He said the records involved
‘‘several’”’ former students.

‘“‘We have a real problem with
balancing the university’s in-
terest and students’ privacy
with a desire to cooperate with
the law and the grand jury,”
Dean John said.

“We want to establish as
university policy on that, and
we have to do that with legal
counsel.

‘“‘We have to comply with cer-
tain requirements of the
‘Buckley Amendment,’ which
prevent unauthorized access to
student files,” he said.

Dean John is scheduled to
testify before the grand jury on
Friday.

The documents were ap-
parently requested through the
office of Commonwealth’s At-

torney John Read.
No subpoenas duces tecum

the National Crime Information
Center computer, and Sutton
says that ‘“‘any jurisdiction that
comes into contact with him has
the right to arrest him and hold
him for extradition.”

He said the suspect is also be-
ing investigated for possible in-
volvement in at least two
burglaries, which would also
carry felony charges.

The police chief confirmed
that the checks were drawn on
the Lexington branch of the
First National Exchange Bank.

Robert P. Diethrich, a
Washington and Lee freshman
who is a customer of FNEB,
said that he had a box of checks
stolen from his dormitory room
during Thanksgiving vacation.

He was aware last week that

(requesting documents) involv-
ing Washington and Lee are on
file with the Clerk of the Court.

On Tuesday, Read gave his
refusal to discuss any aspect of
the investigation.

Clerk of Circuit Court Bruce
Patterson said that 103 different
individuals have received sum-

work on the major in their
sophomore years without any
serious consequences, the
report said.

The committee estimated
that eight to ten students would
graduate with degrees in com-
puter science each year. That
total would be greater than the
average number of graduates
from 18 of 30 majors at W&L,
the committee said.

The committee reported that
enrollment in 100-level courses
would run between less than 30
students to 70 students in some
courses. Nevertheless, it warn-
ed that these were rough
estimates.

-“Enroliment estimates for
the new courses require a

someone had written five of the

checks for a total of $110.
Sutton said last week that the

case had involved ‘‘a coopera-
tive investigative effort’ with
University officials.

A conflict has arisen between
Sutton and Executive Commit-
tee President Robert C. Jene-
vein over what they both say is
“a piece of evidence’ which
Sutton said is related to the
case.

“It is my understanding that
(the EC) may very well possess
instruments or documents of an
evidentiary nature,’’ Sutton
said. “Depending on how the

case develops, I may be in-

terested in obtaining it.”’

“If they have something of an -

evidentiary nature, I will take

records

monses from the grand jury.

Patterson confirmed that on
Nov. 17, the grand jury sub-
poenaed the long distance
telephone records for the last
two years of three former
Washington and Lee students
who have been convicted on
drug charges.

that possessed by the commit-
tee. With few exceptions, in-
stitutions upon creation of a
computer science program
have experienced enrollment
considerably larger than an-
ticipated — sometimes by fac-
tors of five-eight. Appreciating
the character and disposition of
students electing to attend
Washington and Lee, there will
not be a flood of students into
the program...”’ —

The committee said that it did
believe the addition of the com-
puter science major would have
some positive effect on recruit-
ment of students.

“In the opinion of the (Admis-
sions) office, this new program
would benefit their recruiting
efforts, allowing them to
answer in the affirmative a
question, vis a vis computer
science, that now must be gloss-
ed over with vague statements
about an independent major,”’
the committee said.

“As always, I prefer coopera-
tion rather than confrontation,”
he added.

Sutton also said that “‘it is not
absolutely necessary to the case
that I have that piece of
evidence,’’ which he later con-
firmed was ‘‘a document.”’

“TI can get it from somewhere
else,’’ he said.

“By attempting to handle

Darrell offers meal
plan in Cockpit

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Students (including all
freshmen) on the 20-meal con-
tract plan in Evans Dining Hall
can now eat lunch in the
Cockpit, according to Washing-
ton & Lee University Food Ser-
vice Director Jerry Darrell,
who has been working on this
project for over a year.

The newest innovation in his
attempt to improve variety is
lunch in the Cockpit, which has
two options. The first is the dai-
ly “Contract Special,” which
consists of the sandwich of the
day with chips and a pickle
spear, soup, a
beverage, and a dessert. When
soup is not available, french
fries may be substituted. Sand-
wiches are made to order and a
salad bar may be substituted
for the sandwich.

The second option permits
students to order from the
regular menu and take $1.50 off

the bill, although beer and can-
dy may not be included in the
cash credit.

Darrell feels there are a
number advantages to the
system. ‘‘The (main) idea is to
offer the student some diversi-
ty. We hope it will make our 20-
meal plan more popular,”’ says
Darrell, who also says that the
Cockpit offers a restaurant at-
mosphere for student luncheon
meetings.

On Monday, Jan. 23, the first
day of the new system, 15
students ate in the Cockpit. On
Tuesday, 26 people ate there,
although Darrell expects an
average 40-60 people per day
since hamburgers and pizza,
two of the favorite meals, were
served on Monday and Tues-
day. Darrell will be at the
Cockpit during the first two
weeks of the new system to
decide whether it continues or
stops. ‘‘Chances are it’s going to
(continue],” Darrell said.

Matmen run streak to 5

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team ran its winning
streak to five with last night’s
44-6 victory over Virginia State.
The grapplers also took top
honors in the W&L College In-
vitational on Saturday.

After dropping the initial bout
at 118 lbs., the Generals storm-
ed back to win every other mat-
ch. Pacing W&L were Jeff Maz-
za (134 lbs.), Tim Walker (150
Ibs.) and Carlton Peebles
(HWT), who registered pins,
and Larry Anker (142 lbs.), who
won a _ superior decison,
defeating his VSU opponent
31-8.

W&L placed eight wrestlers
in the final round and out-
pointed second-place finisher
Catawba by 29 3/4 points in
Saturday’s Invitational. David-
son finished third, followed by

Lynchburg, Hampden-Sydney,

Elon, the University of the
South, and Pfeiffer.

Larry Anker (134 lbs.) and
Jeff Dixon (190 Ibs.) were the
Generals’ individual cham-
pions. Dixon’s overall record
now stands at 13-0. The other
finalists, all of whom took
second-place finishes, were:
Brian Lifsted (118 lbs.), Jeff
Mazza (126 lbs,), Tim Walker
(142 lbs.), Tim Valliere (167
lbs.), Joe O’Neill (177 lbs.), and
Carlton Peebles (heavyweight).

‘“‘We had a very good team
performance as was indicated
by the eight individuals who
made the finals,’ said head
coach Gary Franke. “Larry
and Jeff, in particular, wrestled
well, but we got good perfor-
mances out of a number of peo-
ple.”’

The Generals see action this
Saturday in a tri-meet at
Washington and Jefferson,
which will also include Hiram
College.

“‘We will be tested this week.
The competition should be good,
and our performance should
give us an indication of just how
good we are,’’ said Franke.
‘They jury is still out, because
we have a long way to go, but I
feel that this team is among the

 

best I’ve ever had here.”’

Cagers bounce back

After a heartbreaking loss to
Roanoke a week ago, the
Generals’ basketball team
bounced back to beat Lynch-
burg and Eastern Mennonite

Fencers stab VMI,
look to Virginia Cup

The Washington and Lee fenc-
ing team won Lexington brag-
ging rights with a 15-12 victory
over VMI last Saturday. The
Generals dropped the second
meet of the day to Navy by a
score of 12-15.

The win over VMI leaves the
Generals 2-1 in state competi-
tion with high hopes for the
Virginia Cup Championship on
Feb. 19. The Cup is a five-way

competition between W&L and
the state’s four other fencing
teams: UVa., VPI, VMI and
William and Mary.

The Generals will be taking a
break this weekend for some in-
dividual amateur competition.
The team will be back in action
on the first weekend of Wash-
ington’s birthday break, when
they will travel to Baltimore to
face Johns Hopkins.

this week, raising its record to
10-6, 5-2 in the conference.

And in the continuing story of
“General Hospital,’ the team
learned that second-leading
scorer Lex Fitzenhagen will be
out for the rest of the season
with ligament damage. In addi-
tion, junior guard Mike Hudson
missed Tuesday night’s game
against Eastern Mennonite with
the flu.

With Fitzenhagen out and for-
wards Scott Shannon and Rob
Spencer slowed by injuries, the
Generals seemed to have little
chance against the undefeated,
third-ranked Maroons.

But the 1,100 fans who packed
Warner Center Thursday night
saw an inspired, disciplined
W&L team control the tempo of
the game and fight to a 54-54 tie
with a minute anda half left.

bounds) took a shot from 10 feet

Sports Editor

...A couple of weeks back, I
petitioned, in my usual, mild-
mannered way, for a little more
fan support for Generals’
teams. A week ago, I saw the
typical turnout for a Roanoke-
W&L confrontation. By the time
the last of the spectors had
trickled out, I felt quite disap-
pointed...but not because of the
outcome. Some of us, I believe,
forgot there was a basketball
game being played. What hap-
pened in the Warner Center last
Thursday night simply left a
bad taste in my mouth. The inci-
dent at the end of the game in-
volving Roanoke players and
coaches and W&L fans where
punches were thrown was a sad
occurrence that may only por-
tend greater and more sense-
less acts of violence. I mean, it
is one thing to come out to cheer
for your team, but it is another
species entirely to go out to
belittle another team and its
fans. There are degrees to spec-
tator participation, and there is
no question that the game last
week overstepped those bounds.
A little disrespect is allowable
but activities such as_ the
Unknown Fans (perhaps a good
idea that has turned sour)
sneaking up on the Roanoke
bench during timeouts or their
failing to yield the way to tne
Roanoke cheerleaders lead one
to wonder where W&L fans are
headed. It’s not any coincidence
that Dick Duden, associate
editor of In The Crease
magazine found W&L’s Wilson
Field to be among his most
unpleasant playing places. A
primary reason: the W&L fans
whom he calls ‘‘geeks” and
“unruly drunkards.’”’ What is
probably most distressing
about this situation is that such
criticism may reflect upon a
minority of those attending
W&L athletic contests. But then
again it’s also distressing to
witness the damage a minority

 

 

can do. W&L is supposedly a

      
     
  
  

Fans’

foul

school steeped in a tradition of
honorable behavior and
gentlemanly conduct. It would
be commendable, rather ex-
pected, that some of us might
like to try to live up to that
ideal...

Time Out...

...On to happier colonnade
happenings: The W&L grap-
plers, having the best record of
any W&L winter sports team at
6-1, is to be congratulated on its
impressive domination of
Saturday’s W&L College Invita-
tional, sending eight men to the
finals and outpointing second
place Catawba by 29 3/4 points.
They are giving one of the finest
seasons ever, led by junior 190
man Jeff Dixon who’s
undefeated on the season. Their
only dual meet loss was to Divi-
sion I Duke. The latest Virginia
College Wrestling Coaches Poll
has them 10th, the only Division
III squad to make the rankings.

Should the rest of their slate
follow suit, give this bunch

along with the fifth-ranked
swimmers (Wow!) a nomina-
tion as W&L team of the year...
Of other concern, the General
cagers showed not only a
valiant effort in last Thurs-
day’s to-do with Roanoke but
also a graciousness in defeat;
for while Coach Ed Green and
the Maroons were mixing it up
with the W&L fans, Coach
Verne Canfield’s gentlemen
quietly headed to the locker
room. The Generals showed
some character as they were
able to bounce back to defeat
Lynchburg on Saturday and
Eastern Mennonite on Tuesday.
Perhaps Thursday’s loss, in
which nearly every player filled
his role perfectly, will serve as
a rejuvenating factor for the
rest of the campaign. With
Fitzenhagen gone for probably
the rest of the year, this group is
going to have to know they can
perform without the Super
Swing Man. Performances like
those of late will give them that

 

confidence. Stay tuned.....

that hung on the rim, then fell
into the hands of a Roanoke re-
bounder.

Roanoke’s Shane Abernathy
then hit two clutch free. throws
to give his team the lead, 56-54,
forcing the Generals to score
again.

With 23 seconds left to
Generals called their last
timeout to set up a play to
senior forward John Lee
Graves (game high of 24 points
and eight rebounds).

Covered by three men,
Graves got the ball on the right
side, turned around and threw
in a 15-footer to tie the game at
56 with 10 seconds remaining.

With no way to stop the clock
to set the defense, W&L could do
little more than watch as the
fast-breaking Maroons sped the
ball downcourt, and guard Reg-
gie Thomas (team high 17
points) tossed in an 18-footer
with three seconds left to win
the game.

“I thought every man on the
team played exceptionally
well,” head coach Verne Can-
field said often the game. ‘You
take a guy like Mike Hudson,
who came in in the second half
and just shut down (Roanoke’s
Tim) Woodson...’ Canfield add-
ed as an example.

You’ve got to give our kids a
lot of credit,’’ said the coach.
“I’m extremely proud of them
and I think the whole school
should be.”

Canfield had one worry after
the game — that the team would
experience a letdown against
Lynchburg, Saturday night.

The Generals did experience
somewhat of a letdown, but the
hapless Gnomes, shooting 35
percent from the field and 58
percent from the free throw
line, were unable to take advan-
tage, as W&L won, 46-45.

But in Warner Center Tues-
day night, the Generals strolled
to a 76-56 victory over Eastern
Mennonite.

The Generals again were not

in top form. Graves, with the
second-highest field goal
percentage in the ODAC, was
four of 14 from the floor, but still
led the team with 18 points.

The bright spot for the
Generals was three freshmen:
guard Fred Bissinger and for-
wards Keith Brideweser and
Rob Spencer. As a group, the
three were 12 of 17 from the
field.

Brideweser, in particular,
has been playing well of late. He
shot 10 of 13 from the floor in
this week’s three games.

‘“‘He’s gaining confidence
with every game, and that’s im-
portant’’’ noted Canfield.

Tonight the Generals travel to
Washington, D.C., to take on
ODAC foe Catholic. Canfield
sees a tougher game than the
two teams’ last meeting, when
W&L dropped the Cardinals,
86-70.

W&L closes the month of
January’ with a home game
against Maryville, Monday
night.

Swimmers fifth in poll

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The College Swimming
Coaches Association has ranked
the Washington and Lee swim-
ming team as the 5th best team
in NCAA Division III.

The rankings, released Mon-
day, concluded a_ successful
weekend for the Generals, who
defeated Georgetown (67-41)
and Frostburg State (66-45) in a
double dual meet at George-
town.

“T think it (the ranking) is in-
flated a little,” head coach
Page Remillard said. “It’s

nothing we’re going to try to
live up to. We’re going to try to
live up to our potential.”’
Remillard stands on his state-
ment of last week that the
Generals’ goal is to finish in the

top 20.

The ranking does please
Remillard, however, because it
brings national recognition to
the W&L swim program and ap-
pears attractive to W&L swim-
ming recruits.

Commenting on the Generals
double victory last weekend,
Remillard said, ‘‘We did what
we had to do. (It was) nothing
spectacular.”’

Joe Donovan and Tim Rock
contributed outstanding perfor-
mances in the W&L victories.
According to Remillard,
Donovan dove very well from
the one meter board, while
Rock’s time in the 800-meter
freestyle converted into a per-
sonal best for the same distance
in yards.

The Generals (5-3) will host
William and Mary on Saturday
at 1 p.m. in the Cy Twombly
Pool.

The meet has historical im-
portance because it is the last

time W&L will meet William
and Mary in swimming. The
William and Mary athletic
department has announced that
this is the last year it will offer
swimming as a varsity sport.

“That (meet) is going to be
real tough,” said Remillard.
“‘The teams are well matched.”

The meet may become a
coaching battle as strategy will
be important in deciding the
winner.

Remillard suggested that a
coach may match his better
swimmers against the opposi-
tion’s weaknesses. Remillard
concluded, however, ‘‘I’d like to
go head to head with them.”

University President John D.
Wilson said that he was not sur-
prised by the outcome.

“IT wouldn’t have said that
last spring,” he said. ‘‘This fall,
I have been a little bit taken
aback by the strong tone of the
Opposition to the idea of even
considering coeducation.”’

“I think these are probably
good numbers,’ he said. “I
don’t argue with the result.”’

Wilson said that in com-
parison with a 1980 survey
directed by Dr. Novack, this

poll ‘‘shows a sharpening of the
negative on the issue, and a
lessening of the middle
responses.”’

The EC selected the questions
from 32 Novack used in his
winter, 1980 survey.

Those who are strongly op-
posed to coeducation increased
21 percent over that study,
while total opposition was up 18
percent.

Wilson attributes this to the
fact that ‘‘there are a lot of an-
cillary issues that have clus-
tered around’’ coeducation.
