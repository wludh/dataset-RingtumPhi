Rush 1983

Wilson concerned about fraternities

Cites problems with Rush

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson expressed
his concern about fraternity life
at the university to the Inter-
fraternity Council and over 50
other W&L students last Thurs-
day night.

President Wilson emphasized
five problems with fraternities
at W&L.

These problems included the
bad physical welfare of houses,
security for ‘open parties,”’
lack of leaders living in the
house, a social calendar that in-
trudes on academics, and a
Rush system that is in Wilson’s
words “unsatisfactory.”’

“‘You’ve inherited a social
structure and a physical struc-
ture that were made for a dif-
ferent time,” Wilson explained
to the students. Wilson added
that the ‘‘(fraternity) house is
in fact, a small party pavilion.”’

With numerous complaints
from the Lexington community
concerning noise and _ trash,
Wilson said, ‘‘all of us should be
more cordial to our neighbors.”’

Although Wilson described
the “‘open party’’ atmosphere at
W&L as “‘the most refreshing

part of fraternity life,” pro-
blems with security are evi-
dent. Considering the recent
problems with rape and as-
saults near fraternities, Wilson
said that he simply did not know
what to do. His only suggestion
was to “close down the open
parties just a little bit.’’

Wilson also said that feelings

in the fraternity houses. “It
doesn’t make sense for a frater-

nity to be abandoned’’ of its
“leadership element.”
Wilson added that the current

condition of the fraternity
houses at W&L serve to deter
students from living in the
houses for more than a year.

You’ve inherited a social structure

and a physical structure that were

made for a different time.

among the faculty at W&L are
“not positive” in regard to
Wednesday night parties. ‘“You
can and should take a look at
how you run your social calen-
dars so that there won’t be such
a transparent intrusion,’’
Wilson told the audience. ‘‘Let
the academics...have a fighting

chance.”
Wilson also objectec to the

fraternity system’s pattern of
having mostly sophomores live

Wilson said if the houses could
become ‘‘physically strong’’
once again, students could, in
turn, restore the fraternities to
the extent that one wouldn’t
mind living in one for two or
three years.

In regard to Rush, ‘“‘a serious
problem’’ according to Wilson,
many items were discussed at
the meeting.

“It’s a lousy orientation for
the freshmen,” Wilson stated.
Although Wilson did admit that
he was not very familiar with
the Rush system at W&L, he
suggested that fraternities
should give freshmen the oppor-
tunity to become more familiar
with each of the houses on cam-
pus and also with the academics
at the school.

Wilson said fraternities are
“running at odds in having
Rush in a concentrated format

that runs right into the first four
weeks of academics.”

The president also described
Rush as being deceptive to
freshmen. With many fraterni-
ty Rush parties providing the -
freshmen with such enticing
items as oysters, live bands and
girls’ Wilson said fraternities
are competing for these “‘in-
nocents’”’ on false grounds.
“Find out what they’re like.
Find out their values,’ Wilson
suggested.

School might intervene

Frats said to need social guidance

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

The chairman of the Alumni
Board of Directors’ Committee
on Fraternity Affairs, the board
which has called for a review of
fraternities at Washington and
Lee, said in an interview Tues-
day that the committee mem-
bers got the impression that the
fraternities at Washington and
Lee University want more
university guidance of social
activities.

‘“‘We agreed that the universi-
ty has got to step in and
establish social guidelines,”’
said William C. Norman Jr.

The 10-member committee
met with fraternity officers on
Sept. 22.

“I want to emphasize that we
believe that a reasonable solu-
tion can be worked out that
would involve alumni participa-
tion,’’ Norman said.

Norman said that the com-
mittee was not anti-fraternity.
All the members of the commit-
tee had been fraternity mem-
bers when they attended
Washington and Lee, Norman
added.

Buddy Atkins, associate
alumni secretary, echoed Nor-
man’s statement. The impres-
sion the committee that met
with the students got was that

the students want more help
and guidance from the universi-
ty, Atkins said.

Atkins said that the alumni
had decided that the frater-
nities “had hit rock bottom’’
about five years ago. The alum-
ni believe that the situation had
improved recently, but they
want the improvement to con-
tinue, Atkins said.

Norman said the fraternities
have done a better job of clean-
ing up the paper cups that
usually litter the fraternity
grounds after a party. Lex-
ington citizens had complained
to alumni officials in 1982 about
the paper cup situation Norman
said.

The physical condition of
many of the fraternity houses
has not gotten any better
though, Norman said. Norman
said that the committee has
been looking into ways to im-
prove conditions.

“Of course, we would not ex-
pect a student who will be here
for only four years to take on a
major renovation project with-
out some alumni support,” said
Norman.

The committee and the fra-
ternity officers also concurred
that fraternities that are
located in residential areas
should be more aware of the
fact that they have neighbors,
Norman said. Norman added
that the fraternity officers said
they would pay more attention
to their neighbors’ rights.

Norman said that the com-
mittee members also believe

that. the fraternity officers
should live in the houses in
order to provide more supervi-
sion to the social life.

Both the fraternity officers
and the committee members
agreed that faculty advisors to
the fraternities should play a
more active role in the frater-
nities’ affairs, Norman said. In
the past, not all faculty advisors
had been active, he said.

Norman said that Rush was
also discuss at the meeting, but
no consensus on the matter was
reached.

There was a consensus that a
pavilion on the back campus for
social activities would be
desirable if the legal and finan-
cial problems associated with
such a project could be worked
out, Norman said. A pavilion
might ease the strain on the
fraternities to host midweek
parties, he said.

“We were extremely im-
pressed with the maturity of the
gentlemen who met with us,”
said Norman. ‘‘They showed a
high degree of responsibility
and great concern for the pro-
blem.”’

Staff Reporter

Last month’s fraternity Rush
was successful from the per-
spective of the Lexington Police
Department, and Chief
Lawrence QO. Sutton said he’d
“like to thank the students for
their cooperation.”

Law enforcement officials
were primarily interested in
matters related to alcohol,
house security, and amplified
sound.

Sutton said he was pleased
with the students’ performance
based on ‘‘comments from
townspeople, on comments that
I received from officers who’ve
been through this before, and on
the complaints I remember
from when I first came here in
May.”’

The chief said that no arrests
were made during Rush for
violations of the new Virginia
law which makes drinking il-
legal for those under the age of
19.

“T’m not aware of any pro-
blems along that line,” Sutton
said. “I feel certain that 18-
year-olds are drinking, but it is
being controlled and protected
by the fraternities.

“I would certainly be naive if
I thought I could prevent every
18-year-old from drinking if
they want to,”’ he said.

‘“‘A success though, is when
you prevent it from becoming a
problem to them or to us. The
credit for that success goes to
the fraternities.”

Wilson raises valid questions

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

“We shouldn’t fight on this.”’

So said Washington and Lee
President John Wilson at a
meeting with the Interfraterni-
ty Council and assorted frater-
nity members last week. While
President Wilson expressed his
wish to avoid a fight with frater-
nity members, it became ap-
parent at the meeting Thursday
that he already had one on his
hands.

At the IFC meeting, Presi-
dent Wilson expressed the need
for examination of several
areas of fraternity life.
Dilapidated houses, a hectic fall
Rush schedule, lengthy and
academically taxing Wednes-
day night parties, fraternity
security and _ total-sophomore
occupancy were the main areas
requiring examination, Presi-
dent Wilson said.

Wilson spoke in his character-
istically calm and articulate
manner at the meeting, explain-
ing that, as a new president to
the university, it is his duty to
raise these issues for scrutiny
and not to impose rash,
undeliberated changes on the 17
fraternities on campus.

 

and cooperation” as the factors
that resulted in positive rela-
tions between the houses and
the police.

"Chief L.O. Sutton

“I think we have accomplish-
ed a lot more through the means
of cooperation than would have
been accomplished through
confrontation,” he said.

The chief said, however, that
he would not have hesitated to
take action if circumstances
had warranted it.

“If I had perceived a serious
problem,”’ he said, ‘“‘I would not
have waited for the ABC. I
would have used my own under-
cover methods.”’

A rape and assault at a frater-
nity house midway through
Rush focused campus-wide at-
tention on the need for increas-
ed security at parties.

But before he had finished
speaking and answering ques-
tions, Wilson had been pushed
to the wall on several issues by
students who felt strongly about
their fraternity and the system
as a whole.

News
Analysis

TREE IE RENE OE TOTAL ETLIN NT TIEN TO
While it is a touchy question

and one that is defended
fervently by many who enjoy
the benefits of fraternity life,
President Wilson must be allow-
ed the opportunity to simply
raise the questions. And, in
turn, the fraternities must give
ample time and study to the
questions which affect 800 men
at Washington and Lee.

Throughout the spring of 1983
and through the early weeks of
this school year, rumors have
been floating about our new
president concerning coeduca-
tion and now, fraternities.

What does he know about
W&L? students asked. This is
not Virginia Tech, who does he
think he is?

ticular problem (security) had

not arisen,’’ Sutton said, ‘‘and I

was not aware it was a problem.

“T will be the first to admit
that I probably should have dis-

cussed it. But not having surfac-
ed as a problem, it did have a

lower priority.”

The chief said that ‘like
many things, social problems
are not recognized as problems
until they surface and the pro-
blem is created.”’

House presidents had “‘a very
good response”’ to his sugges-
tions for tightening security
following the crime, Sutton
said.

“There was an awareness
and concern that had not been
evident before...The frater-
nities deserve the credit for
making my views known and
then implementing them.”’

Sutton said that the recom-
mendations he made ‘‘were
geared strictly for this com-
munity on a_ cost-effective
basis.”

For example, he did not sug-
gest the hiring of security
guards, because ‘‘students
know how to recognize each
other better than a security
guard could.”

Officer Steven E. Crowder
walked around out of uniform to
nearly all the fraternities the
Wednesday night following the
rape to assure himself that
“security was in fact going to be
enforced, and was going to

™, (continued on page 4)

No, this is not Virginia Tech.
And it had not become apparent
yet that President Wilson is
seeking to conform W&L to his
ideas of what a university
should be.

Instead, he recognizes W&L
for the unique and traditional
school it is. What President
Wilson does offer the university
is a new, fresh viewpoint which
can serve as an impetus for im-
provement.

Each of the issues President
Wilson has raised is an ar-
guably valid point. The fra-
ternity system can hardly say it
is not worthy of some im-
provement. And obviously the
fraternities will not be willing to
accede to President Wilson
each of his terms of change ver-
batim. The key for this to be a
beneficial review for both the
fraternities and the administra-
tion lies in the ability of the two
to find a middle ground.

No, as President Wilson said,
‘“‘We shouldn’t fight on this.”’

‘I’m here to invite you to help
us solve (these problems),”’
President Wilson said last
week, ‘‘because it’s of interest
tous all.’”’

  

The question of whether or
not a smaller percentage of
Washington and Lee freshmen
participating in Fraternity
Rush has resulted in a fewer
number of freshmen pledges
has not yet been determined,
according to Dan Murphy,
Associate Dean of Students in
charge of Fraternity Affairs.

“I don’t know if the actual
number of people who pledged
fraternities is up or down,”’ said
Murphy, whose office is cur-
rently processing the Inter-
fraternity Council preference
cards and should have statistics
sometime this week.

M''rphy said that 325
students, including about 20
transfer students and
sophomores, went through
Rush. The 305 freshmen who did
go through account for just
under 85 percent of the entering
class, compared with the nor-
mal 95 percent of the past few
years, although Dean Murphy is
quick to point out that these are
“not hard and fast statistics.”’

Last year, 352 people went
through Rush, and the incoming
class size was 363. IFC Presi-
dent Emery Ellinger said he
feels the questions of numbers
and percentages has been over-
worked. ‘‘Rush orientation was
a lot better than it has been in
the past,’’ Ellinger said who
also noted that while there is
always some confusion during
Rush, this year’s freshmen

and more aware of what was go-
ing on.

As usual, there were some
mixed reactions to Rush. If
houses do want to _ boost
membership with a Spring
Rush, “...it’s up to the in-
dividual fraternities,’ said
Dean John, and for the future,
“President Wilson is stressing
the investigation of deferred
(second semester) rush.”’

Reaction to this idea is mixed.
Some freshmen, such as in-
dependent Andrew Tartaglione
thought that Fall Rush was con-
fusing, yet at the same time
said, “It’s a good way to meet
people. I think they should keep

“Financially, frats can’t hold
out on a second semester rush,”’
Ellinger said. ‘Obviously you
may want a little more time,
but by the time you get to col-
lege, you should be able to make
a decision concerning the peo-
ple you want to hang around
with.”’

Some freshmen said they con-
sider the financial aspect of
fraternities a burden. Ron
Curry, for example, has receiv-
ed a bid at Zeta Beta Tau, and
would like to pledge. “It
depends on money,” Curry
said.

Mike Weisbrock said he did
not go through Rush to save
money and because he has a
general disinterest in frater-
nities.

majority of the freshmen interviewed thought the university program preparing the students for Rush,
in conjunction with the Rush book prepared by the Interfraternity Council, gave them a basic idea of

Crowder, who was off duty at
the time but had the chief’s per-
mission for his mission, said he
was ‘“‘very impressed’ and
‘‘well-satisfied’’ by what he saw
at the houses.

“Tl had really good coopera-
tion and very positive results
from the students,’ he said.

At all of the houses but one,
Crowder was approached and
asked for his identity upon ar-
rival.

“At one house, though, I could
have gone in and picked up
anything and walked off with
it,”’ the officer said.

Security problems at that
fraternity have since been
“resolved” according to Sutton.

Another concern of the police
department was fraternities’
use of their ‘“‘amplified sound’’
permits.

“There is no such thing as a
‘noise permit,’”’ the chief
pointed out.

Sutton said that ‘‘overall,”’
the use of fraternity stereo
privileges has been “‘very good.

“There have been a few cases
of abuse that have resulted in
warnings, but no summonses
have been written.”

“Some of the fraternities are
getting careless, though.’’ the
chief said, ‘“‘because they are
applying for the amplified
sound permit and then not
bothering to pick it up.

“If they don’t pick them up,
they don’t have them.’’ This has
involved more than eight cer-
tificates in the last few weeks.

The permits were available
for the three Wednesdays of
Rush, but Chief Sutton says that
at university direction, they are
now issued for Friday and
Saturday nights only. At this
point, the chief is the only one
who can sign the permits.

“They end at midnight,” Sut-
ton stressed. ‘‘The law
specifically says 11 o’clock. The
eleven to midnight grace period
is extended to allow the party to
wind down without suddenly
cutting everything off. That ex-
tra hour is extended in the spirit
of cooperation.”’

Fraternities seldom adhere
strictly to that schedule.
‘“‘They’ve been pushing it,”’ the
chief said, ‘‘but not too hard.”’

One night during Rush, Sutton
went around after midnight and
ended ten parties for noise con-
siderations.

“I found the greatest amount
of cooperation in all but one
fraternity,” the chief recalled.
“T think the time just slipped up
on them. They were very coop-
erative about shutting it down.”

At one fraternity which Sut-
ton declined to specify, he ‘‘con-
tacted the president of the
house and told him that his per-
mit had expired and he would
have to cut it off.”’

Sutton says the president
“tried, I felt, to lay his respon-
sibility for not controlling his
house on the police.
