EC reps
tell dean
of dispute

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Letters submitted to Dean of
Students Lewis G. John charge
that a counsel for the accused at
Thursday’s open honor hearing
threatened and physically at-
tacked one of the Executive
Committee advocates during a
pre-trial conference.

EC President Bob Jenevein
and senior law representative
Jim Green said in the letters that
‘the incident involving John L.
White, the University’s director
of minority affairs and a law stu-
dent, occurred last Wednesday
in a law school meeting room.

White was one of two ad-
vocates for a student who was
found guilty by a student body
jury of ‘‘gaining unfair
academic advantage on a
Biology 100 examination by tak-
ing it in an unauthorized location
and/or using unacknowledged
and unauthorized aid.”’

All three parties say the con-
frontation occurred after a
disagreement over the ad-
missibility of a piece of
evidence.

“They’re dealing with in-
dividuals,’’ Dean John said. “‘I
should make no comment on
that.”

Kelly M. Wrenn, president of
the Student Bar Association and
chairman of the hearing, said he
witnessed the incident in ques-
tion but would have no further
comment at this time.

Green said that about half an
hour into the meeting, White,
who was about 15 feet from him
at the time, ‘‘screamed in a
moderately loud voice, ‘Don’t
f--k with me, Green.’ ”’

Green also quoted White as
saying, ‘I’m going to kill you,
Green. I’m going to get you.
You’d better watch out.”’

EC votes
tolerance

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

A proposal to make failing to
report an honor violation an
honor violation itself was re-
jected 9-1 by the Executive Com-
mittee Tuesday night.

However, the EC voted to
change the language in the en-
forcement section of the White
Book to say that a student must
either confront a person he
suspects of committing an honor
violation or report the possible
honor violation to an EC mem-
ber. Previously, the White Book
said that a student should
confront the student or report
the possible violation.

In order for the proposed revi-
sions to be included in the White
Book, the EC must approve
them by a simple majority a se-
cond time.

The original proposal to make
failing to report an honor viola-
tion an honor violation itself was
defeated after little debate.
Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers said that he
agreed with the philosophy

 

Grand jury opposition builds

Former waitress, 23, organizes anti-probe meetings

By ALLEN REESE
and
TORI RICHARDSON
Special To the Phi

Angela Fawcett, a 23-year-old former waitress,
has emerged as a central figure in the opposition to
Commonwealth’s Attorney Beverly ‘‘John’’ Read’s
special grand jury investigation of drug trafficking
in Rockbridge County.

Fawcett has appeared three times before the
special grand jury and has organized a public
meeting that gave people a forum to express their
concerns and ask questions about the way the grand
jury is conducting business.

Fawcett’s frankness about her past police record
and use of drugs is at first disarming. The slim
brunette said she has used LSD, marijuana and co-
caine. She said she gave up using cocaine because
she didn’t like it. But Fawcett obviously sees

nothing wrong with the use of pot.

‘Pot has been here as long as I have known, and
as long as my grandparents have known, and the
special grand jury will make no differenoe. In 25
years people of this area will look back — when
marijuana is legal, and taxes are being collected on
it — and laugh at all the money and time that has
been put into this.”’

‘‘How is John Read going to justify the expen-
ditures of the special grand jury, a police dog and
the use of a helicopter in a small town where the use
of drugs is no more common than in any other
place?”’ she asks.

Originally from Charleston, West Virginia,
Fawcett now lives just outside of Lexington in the
Willow Springs housing complex. Her apartment is
small, but big enough for herself and her three-
year-old daughter, Shandah.

down
clause

behind the “‘tolerance clause,”’
but did not think that failing to
report an honor violation should
also be an honor violation.

The ‘‘tolerance clause’ was
debated much more extensively
Monday night, when the EC read
through the White Book Revi-
sions Committee’s proposals for
the first time.

Former EC President Bennett
Ross told the committee that the
tolerance clause would be
almost impossible to enforce.
Ross also argued that by ex-
panding the parameters of the
honor system, the EC would en-
danger the entire system.

“No longer does it become a
system in which I’m responsible
for my own actions. A guy who
reports an honor violation should
want to do it because of the
honor system, not because I feel
responsible to do it,’’ said Ross.

Vice President Dave Judge
and sophomore representative
James White both reported that
they believed many students op-
posed the “‘tolerance clause.”

“T’ve heard it called a
‘squealer rule,’ ’’ White said.

Lee Feldman and Jill Fau-
stini, members of the Revisions
Committee, both spoke in favor
of the ‘‘tolerance clause’ at the
Monday night meeting.

“You cannot want an honor
system and not want to be
responsible, too,’’ Miss Faustini
said.

Feldman called the EC’s deci-
sion not to make failing to report
an honor violation also an honor
violation ‘‘spineless.”’

“It’s gotta be strong, but it
can’t be an honor violation,”’
said EC Secretary Jim Messer.

The EC approved the revised
language by a 9-0 vote, with two
members abstaining.

In other action, the EC re-
jected a proposed revision to
change the composition of the
committees that investigate
honor violations from two EC
members and one member of the

Review and Outlook

 

Splitting Roles

When the news of the altercation between Minority
Affairs Director John White and EC law rep Jim
Green first circulated we were initially surprised and
appalled. We understand that the atmosphere sur-
rounding an open honor trial can become very tense.
But a reaction as violent as White’s is clearly innap-
propriate.

‘The most important question now is exactly how the
University will handle the problem. White, who has
been director of the minority affairs office since 1979
and is currently a second-year law student, maintains
that if he is treated as an administrator rather than as
a student such a disciplinary approach would be ‘‘a
little cheap.”’ This rationale seems to us to be a bit
blurred.

As Executive Committee President Bob Jenevein
noted, White is primarily a University administrator.
He is trusted with the management of an immensely
important office within the operation of W&L.
Therefore his character as a Washington and Lee ad-
ministrator should be examined and not simply as a
student appearing before the Student Control Com-
mittee.

The circumstances which allowed White to serve as
an accused’s advocate in an open honor trial are in-
deed unusual. Such a case involving an admin-
istrator/student presents a complicated conflict in
the handling of this case. It is our simple concern that
White be considered by the University as an ad-
ministrator and that this case is not treated simply as
another student-to-student incident.

Letters

Coed may not be solution

A copy of this letter was sent to
The Ring-tum Phi for publica-
tion,

To the Board of Trustees:

I am writing in response to Mr.
Jack Warner's letter of April 20,
1984, urging an expression of
opinion on the upcoming co-
education decision at Wash-
ington and Lee University.

I believe that my constant
association with the University
since graduation in 1974
qualified me to give an informed
response to his thought-
provoking letter. I am the son of
an alumnus, I have served as
Washington, D.C., Alumni
Chapter President, I have
organized a yearly scholarship
grant, I have served as an alum-
ni admissions representative, I
have guest lectured in the Jour-
nalism School, and I have con-
tributed regularly to the annual
fund.

Although I have a definite
opinion on co-education, I have
not written specifically to give
that opinion. The primary pur-
pose of this letter is to express
my concern over the way the co-
education choice is being ap-
proached. Using the decline in
the college age population as
justification to push the adoption
of a coeducation plan ignores the
real problem faced by the ad-
missions office.

I find it most curious that
coeducation is being approached
from a demographic standpoint
rather than a philosophical one.
The philosophy of all-male
education at W&L is not an issue,
but rather the need to institute
coeducation is based on
demographic proof. I submit
that the Board of Trustees is be-
ing made a victim of scare tac-
tics used by those who would
manipulate numbers to their
own advantage. As a marketing
executive, I am all too familiar
with the way demographics can
be used as justification for any
purpose the user wishes.

The real problem is one of
modern marketing. Washington
& Lee is behind the times in this
area, relying on reputation and
visits of admissions officers to
do the job. Today’s competitive
marketplace demands that
Washington & Lee enter the race
with modern thinking. To this
point the Board of Trustees have
been less than responsive.

The admissions department is
not given the modern marketing
support that today’s market
demands to properly represent
the University, hindering the ad-
missions officers from ac-
complishing their goals. The
demographic trends are being
used by the Board as an excuse
to institute coeducation, not as a
reason. The quality of education
offered by W&L, the reputation
and visibility of the University’s
numerous famous graduates,
and the vast number of eligible
potential applicants from across
the country should insure that
the University has the best ap-
plicants from across the country
to choose from. However, this is

not the case. The reality is that
Washington & Lee is already
beginning to settle for accepting
some applicants who are not up
to the University’s standards.
Why? Because the Board of
Trustees has not seen where the
real need is. They want to use
coeducation as a bandage that
will repair the damage done by a
Board who is satisfied with

' marketing techniques that are

amatuerish, dated, and provin-
cial. Admissions officers need
the advantages of professional
marketing support; the same
tools used by universities who
have much more of an eye on the
future. Co-education without a
change in attitude toward the
total marketing of the Universi-
ty is only a temporary solution.
What, may I ask, happens should
the quality of applicants still
decline after a coeducational
program is in place? Is it only
then that the Board of Trustees
will wake up to the real prob-
lem?

If the Board of Trustees is
really interested in guarantee-
ing the high standards of the stu-
dent population and the con-
tinued success of its educational
goals, they should table the issue
of coeducation until they can
focus their attention on a perma-
nent solution to the real problem
W&L faces.

Retain the services of a top
public relations and publicity
firm that will work with W&L to
develop and carry out a strategy
designed to make the ideals, ad-

vantages and realities of life at
Washington & Lee known to the
American public. A concerted
effort in this area would surely
satisfy the long term needs of the
University by enhancing the
school’s image and desirability
at a lower financial cost than the
alternative imposition of
coeducation. At the same time, it
would not alienate a majority of
the alumni and student com-
munities.

I suggest that this tactic be us-
ed for a two-year period within
which you can easily judge the
results. Should this effort alone
not be fruitful, then, and only
then take up coeducation as an
additional solution.

I submit the above observa-
tions in the hope that you will see
that you are focusing on a sup-
posed solution that does not cure
the problem. Coeducation should
only be addressed as an option
on its own merits.

Washington & Lee is unique in
its education experience. That
experience translates to a life
and character-molding effect
that reaches far beyond the
classroom. Coeducation for the
wrong reasons will destroy that.
I for one will not support a
university, coed or not, that does
not reflect the individuality of
the character of the _per-
sonalities it has spawned. Prob-
lems should be addressed with
solutions, not makeup!

Would you like whine
with your meal, sir?

To the Editors:

It would appear that at long
last the accumulated effects of
countless dosages of mass pro-
duced fried chicken have
rendered the tastebuds of your
galloping gormand null and
void. I, too, am a “‘perceptive
chowhound”’ in my own right, as
well as an all too frequent patron
of that ‘Fine Fast Food’
establishment Mr. Curran so
generously accommodated in his
most recent article. Imagine,
then, my sense of shock and em-
barrassment to find my personal
hero, and an inspiration to
garbage-pallattes everywhere
(he was, after all, the man who
wasn’t afraid to tell the truth
about Long John Silver’s), at-
tempting to relieve our friend on

Washington Street of his well
deserved status as official brunt
of worst-food-in-town criticisms.

Like Mr. Curran, I have also
noticed that the Chicken Nug-
gets have a taste ‘‘not unlike that
of a good fried oyster.’’ However
I think it should be pointed out
that these prefabricated morsels
aspire to be judged within the
category of poultry, not seafood.
Would it not be equally astute to
assert that the french fries have
a taste ‘‘Not unlike that of a good
chilled possum entrail?”’

I chastize Mr. Curran for
lashing out at those of us who
reserve the right to whine and
puke after eating a meal so poor
it would make you want to slap
your grandma’.

IFC asks SAC to recommend two-week Rush

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Interfraternity Council
planned to propose a two-week
Rush calendar, with a maximum
of two beer parties for each
fraternity, at today’s Student Af-
fairs Committee meeting, IFC
President David Perdue said
Tuesday.

The proposal, made in re-
sponse to a report by the Ad Hoc

Committee on Fraternity Af-
fairs, is a compromise of the
committee’s recommendation of
a dry, one-week Rush and
previous Rushes ranging from
two to four weeks with the oppor-
tunity for up to nine beer parties.

The University Council, which
has the final vote on the Rush
calendar, held its last meeting of
the year this afternoon at 4:15, at
which the SAC was scheduled to

make its final recommendation.

Perdue said he thought the UC
would agree to whatever calen-
dar the SAC proposed.

“I think they (the UC) will just
go on SAC’s recommendation,
because they have respect for
the Student Affairs Committee,’’
Perdue said.

But he was less sure about
whether the SAC, consisting of
five faculty members and five

H-SC student’s death still

a mystery after a month

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

As Hampden-Sydney College
seniors prepare this week for
their Sunday graduation, police
and College officials are still baf-
fled by the mysterious death
of one of their classmates almost
a month ago.

Jeffrey Neville Friend, a 22-
year-old economics major, was
killed April 4 when he leaped
nude onto the hood of a passing
car on U.S. 360 near a small town
about 20 miles south of Hamp-
den-Sydney.

Police found Friend’s car
about 100 yards down the road
alongside a ditch where his
clothes and wallet were also
found.

Officers conducting. a state
police investigation have ruled

out the possibility of a robbery in
the strange incident, according
to. Sgt. B.R. Ritenour of the
Virginia State Police who is
working on the investigation.

Ritenour said Friend had stop-
ped at a gas station about one
hour and 45 minutes before he
was killed and had paid for
gasoline with a check because he
had no cash. He said Friend ask-
ed the attendant to sketch a map
of the route back to Hampden-
Sydney and the attendant said
Friend seemed dazed and con-
fused.

“It’s not a difficult route back
to Hampden-Sydney from
there,”’ Ritenour said.

He said that state police were
proceeding with the case as a
criminal investigation and were
trying to to retrace Friend’s
steps on the rainy night of the ac-

ities ~wai{ {its usta Fil} ites

cident. Police in Keysville, a
town near the site of the acei-
dent, are not pursuing the case
but leaving it entirely to the

- state police.

Dr. Gregory Wanger, who per-
formed the autopsy after the ac-
cident, said that a toxicology
test, an analysis of body fluids
and tissue that determines
whether drugs or alcohol were
present at the time of death, had
been performed and that the
results would not be available
for over a month.

According to Ritenour, tox-
icology’ tests are not always
routine, but because of the
curious circumstances
surrounding the death, he
thought the test might provide
some helpful information.

students, would approve the
IFC’s proposal, prepared by the
IFC’s Rush Committee.

The SAC turned down an
earlier IFC proposal of a three-
to four-week Rush.

“They’re probably going to
want (Rush) cut down even
more,”’ Perdue said, ‘‘but I think
there’s really no way we can cut
it down more than we’re doing
now.”

The specifics of the IFC’s pro-
posal of the calendar, Perdue
said, include ‘‘intense’”’ rushing
during Orientation Week, with
less activity during the first
week of classes.

This way, Perdue said, ‘“The

freshmen get an opportunity to

pledge and be finished with Rush
after the first week of school.”’

The proposal will bring back
more one-on-one communication
between freshmen and fraterni-
ty members, without inter-
ference from the Rush-party at-
mosphere, Perdue said. But at
the same time he said he wanted
to include one big beer party so
freshmen could see that side of
the fraternities also.

Associate’ Dean of Students
Dan N. Murphy, an SAC
member, said that the SAC and

the IFC are working together to
construct a calendar suitable to
both committees.

“IT would imagine there will be
a compromise somewhere be-
tween the wishes of the two
groups,’’ Murphy said.

“‘T agree with some of (the Ad
Hoc Committee’s) ideas and see
the need for improvement,”’ Per-
due said, ‘‘but I think we need to
have a say in this also and not
have anything forced upon us.”’

“They can’t ask for much
more of a change from this year
to next year. We’ve made very
wide changes in it, cut down on
everything they wanted us to,
and kept very much in the spirit
of what they wanted,’’ he added.

The other suggestions made
by the Ad Hoc Committee,
chaired by Professor John
Evans, who is also an SAC
member, won’t be taken up by
the IFC and SAC until next year,
Perdue said.

“We're working primarily on
the Rush question,’ Murphy
confirmed, ‘‘because it’s the
more pressing matter,” since
the UC today finished its
schedule of meetings for this
year, ‘‘and we need their ap-
proval.”’

‘Even my friends were alienating me’

(continued from page 1)

There are oriental tapestries
draped across the walls and
paintings that compliment a
serene atmosphere. Pictures of
Fawcett’s friends and family
line one wall near the stereo,
which fills the room with sounds
of Creedence Clearwater
Revival.

After Shandah is given over to
a trusted neighbor to go shop-
ping, Fawcett sits down Indian
style in her armchair and lights
a cigarette. She begins to ex-
press her dire concern over the
way officials have been dealing
with her and many others before
the grand jury.

‘Read is calling all of these
high school students in and mak-
ing them divulge information
without informing them that
what they say before him can be
used to incriminate them later.
These poor kids and _ their
families are not familiar with
how the judiciary system works,

present.”’

Fawcett said that the injustioe
done to these teenagers, along
with the number of people she
had met who wished to express
their opinions in public, promp-
ted her to organize the April 10
meeting at the Lexington Fire
Department. The meeting was
Fawcett’s idea, and she primari-
ly financed it. ‘‘Most of the ads
were paid for from my own
pocket,” she said.

Over 50 people were reported
to have shown up for the
meeting. Approximately $65 was
contributed to help pay for the
ads and to organize the second
meeting, according to Fawcett.
There was a $50 bill contributed
anonymously the night of the
meeting.

Fawcett used to work at the
Howard Johnson’s north of Lex-
ington as a waitress. Now she
lives on the $181 a month she gets
from Aid to Dependent Children
payments and another $114 a
month in food stamps.

turning away from her, she said,
because of the controversy that
she has been generating. When
she talks about it she seems both
angry and sad. ‘‘I went to a par-
ty and was asked to leave,’
Fawcett said. ‘‘I was angry that
even my friends were alienating
me in fear that they too would be
arrested or brought before the
special grand jury.”’

In her first appearance before
the special grand jury March 22,
Fawcett was asked questions by
Read for over three hours, she
said. Larry Mann, a local at-
torney, was with her to advise
her on her rights. At this time,
she said she admitted that she
had bought LSD from a man in
Roanoke on more than one occa-
sion. She said she never bought
more than 50 “hits” of LSD. A
‘‘hit’”’ is a drug-saturated square
of construction paper that sells
for between three and six
dollars.

Though she met with the man
three times, Fawcett testified
that she could not describe him
because each time they met his
face was hidden from her in
some way. Either he wore a
motorcycle helmet or his face
was not in the light, she said.

But she did know his name.
When Fawcett was asked to tell
the grand jury his name she
refused, saying that she was the
only person in this area that he
did business with, and that if she
gave them his name it would
place her life and her daughter’s
life in danger. When she refused
to answer, Read told her that she
would be held in contempt.

On April 11 Fawcett appeared
before a judge on the contempt
charge. Prior to the hearing she
had heard that the man who sup-

 

plied her with the LSD had been
killed in a motorcycle accident.
She confirmed this by checking a
report in a newspaper. At that
point, she said she felt safe to
give the judge the name.

Also during her first ap-
pearance before the grand jury
Read asked her for a list of the
people she had hired at various
times to babysit her daughter.
She refused to do this, making an
insulting comment and telling
him that it was ‘none of his
business. Fawcett said she
thought that she would be held in
contempt for this too, but Read
dropped the matter.

Because of these events and
her views, she said she believes
that she is being harassed.
Recently her apartment has
been searched. In addition she
has been repeatedly pulled over
while driving, had her car im-
pounded and been afraid that
Shandah would be taken from
her.

During her testimony before
the grand jury, Read is said to
have made some vague state-
ments that he thought her
daughter would be better off if
she were taken from Fawcett.

Larry Mann has confirmed
that Read did give her cause to
worry. The day after her
testimony, Jeff Peck of Protec-
tive Services appeared at her
door to see if the child was well

- cared for. Fawcett said that she

had already sent Shandah to live
with her grandparents. She
suspected that Peck had gotten
instructions from Read to come
over. Though Read denied it,
Mann called Peck’s visit, ‘‘too
coincidental.’’

This was not the first time that
Peck had come to her apartment

months from the Oct. 24 im-
panelling of the jury. The special
grand jury will make its recom-
mendation to a regular grand
jury, which can be reconvened to
issue indictments at any time.

Last month, a special counsel
was named to assist the panel at
the same time that opponents of
the investigation became _in-
creasingly vocal.

Former U.S. Attorney Leigh
B. Hanes Jr. said when he was
appointed last month that his in-
volvement would be ‘‘a limited
thing. It was concurred in by
(Commonwealth’s Attorney)
John Read to tackle a particular
problem that has come up. This
is absolutely not a reflection on
the performance of the com-
monwealth’s attorney.”’

Hanes, 66, graduated from
Hampden-Sydney College and
has a private law practice in

Fincastle.

Circuit Court Judge George E.
Honts III, who appointed Hanes,
said the action came at the re-
quest of the grand jury foreman.
‘It appears the grand jury had
gotten into a sensitive area and
felt the need for outside
counsel,”’ he said.

“T am not at liberty to tell the
basis of the request. The ap-
pointment is not intended in
anyway to reflect on Read’s ac-

tivity. He will not review any- »

thing John has done. I advised
[Read] of what was going to be?
done, and he agreed.”

“There was one matter that
came up and the grand jury re-
quested a special counsel,”’
Read said at the time of the ap-
pointment. ‘‘I certainly agreed,
as it relates to that one very sen-
sitive matter.”’

“IT think Mr. Hanes is
outstanding,’ he continued. ‘‘I
respect him immensely.”’

Meanwhile, more than 50 peo-
ple met at the Lexington fire sta-
tion last month to discuss con-
cerns about local law enforce-
ment and the drug investigation.
The session was moderated hy

or her first brush with the law.
She had been arrested previous-
ly for driving while intoxicated
and assaulting a police officer.
The assault happened while she
was intoxicated, and she was
released with a suspended
sentence. Some time ago she
was a witness in a murder in-
vestigation in White Sulphur
Springs, .W.Va.

Still seated in her armchair,
while friends wander in and out
to drink from a keg of beer in the
bathtub, Fawcett spoke of leav-
ing the area after the grand jury
investigation is over.

“I have made a deposit on a
place to live and have a job offer
in another town, if I can move by
the fourth of June.”’ -

Before then she hopes to hold
another meeting to discuss the
tactics of the special grand jury.
This time Fawcett hopes to get
permission to hold the meeting
in the Lexington High School
gym. She is trying to get a list of
the people brought before the
grand jury so they can be in-
vited. She also wants to invite
Lexington Police Chief L.O. Sut-
ton, Read, Rockbridge County
Sheriff S.M. Reynolds, Lex-
ington Mayor Charles Phillips —
and City Manager John V.
Doane so they can answer ques-
tions.

She concluded, ‘‘I feel like
what is done in the privacy of
your own home, as long as it
does not tremendously affect
anyone else, is your own
business. I feel the money that is
being spent could be better used
on drug rehabilitation programs
or family counseling.’’ At least
one W&L fraternity is collecting
money to assist in the organiza-
tion of the new meeting, she
said.

Also attending was law pro-
fessor J. Timothy Phillips, a
member of a committee recently
appointed by the local bar
association to study the ad-
ministration of justice in Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County.

The two-hour meeting was
organized by Angela Fawcett,
23, of Lexington. “I think this
shows there are still a lot of
questions that need to be
answered,” she said the night of
the meeting. ‘‘The next step is to
have another meeting and hope-
fully get some answers.”’

Later that week, after Ms.
Fawcett testified for the drug
panel for the third time, her
house was searched by Rock-

She said they confiscated a piece

used for smoking marijuana.

Friday parade opens Mock Con weekend

By J. THOMAS WILTSE
Mock Convention Correspondent

A two-hour parade through
downtown Lexington will kick-
off the Washington and Lee
Mock Democratic Convention
next Friday beginning at 10 a.m.

Two Mock Convention sessions
will be held later that day, at 1
p.m. and 8 p.m., and the final
session Saturday at 9:30a.m.

Co-chairmen of the Parade
Committee Matt Thompson and
Drew Perkins began contacting
participants last May for the
parade, which will consist of
over 55 delegation floats and a

Hudson death inquiry

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The traffic accident that
resulted in the April death of a
Washington and Lee student is
still under investigation by the
Pensacola, Fla., police depart-
ment.

John Buddin, a_ traffic
homicide investigator for the
department, said his investiga-
tion was taking longer than
originally planned but that he
expected to be finished in about
10 days.

Ruben Ray Hudson Jr., who
was a junior at Washington and
Lee, died April 14 following an

number of area civic organiza-
tions, including the Roanoke
Shriners

The 95-piece Virginia Tech
Regimental Band heads the line-
up of marching bands — which
includes eight additional local
high school units.

“Unlike past years, we really
stressed the importance of hav-
ing a number of marching bands
participate. We have tried to
break up the monotony which
can come with viewing over 50
floats in a row,’ explained
Thompson.

Thompson and Perkins were
still attempting to book a Coors

April 12 accident in which the
car he was riding in hit a stalled
car on the side of the road.

Senior Duncan Stone of Pen-
sacola was driving the car at the
time of the accident, and another
Washington and Lee student,
Sophomore J. Jackson Willett,
also was riding in it.

“Our investigation...is becom-
ing quite lengthy,”’ Buddin said.
“Anytime we have a death,
we’re more thorough.”

Buddin, who termed the inci-
dent ‘‘a freak accident,”’ said he
had to talk to several more
witnesses who had cdéme into
contact with the three students

Stone was charged with

the accident and pleaded not

faces a July trial date.

Hudson was partially leaning
out the door at the time of the ac-
cident, according to T.C. Miller,
a police department spokesman.
“The car struck a stalled
automobile which was to the
right of the road, trapping Hud-
son’s head,” Miller said last
month.

White aids police in arrest

Student body vice president-
elect James A. White assisted
Lexington police Saturday in de-
taining a man suspected of at-
tempting to sell drugs near the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity
house.

White said he was outside the
house when the man approached
him and after a brief conversa-
tion offered to sell him eight
pounds of sensimillion..

After White had told the man
he had a friend who might be in-
terested, he went inside and call-
ed police. Sgt. Wayne Straub ar-
rived in plain clothes and at-
tempted to make the purchcase,
but the man had apparently be-
come suspicious and withdrew
the offer.

At the scene of the attempted

sale, officer S. H. Cash found a
medicine vial filled with a
substance that field tested as
marijuana.

After being held briefly at the
Lexington police station, the
man, a Lynchburg resident, was
transported to Blacksburg,
where four warrants were
outstanding against him.

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said that a search of the
man’s car revealed that he had
actually been attempting to sell
an eight-pound, brown bag filled
with leaves and trash.

“Fraternities are taking such
a bad rap for drugs and other
things, this was a golden oppor-
tunity to let everyone know
we’re not a bunch of druggies,”
White said.

and Sweet Things.

Now that the hard part’s over,
here’s a review of two spring
treats: Westmoreland and Sweet
Things. Westmoreland, because
it’s open after being closed all
winter, and Sweet Things,
because ice-cream-eating
weather is finally upon us.

Westmoreland is arrived at by
getting on Route 11, and going
approximately 15 miles south,
all the while looking to your left.

Most people that have been to
Westmoreland, or go there

regularly, do so only on Sunday
nights, though keep in mind that
it’s open every day.
Westmoreland is synonomous
with fried chicken, and for good
reason. For $4.50 you get a buffet

Entertainment

with all the fried chicken, ham,
green beans, assorted salads,
vegetables and pies you can eat.
Their fried chicken, though not
the perfect fried chicken that I
described earlier in the year, is
better than any that can be got in
Lexington. Because it’s all you
can eat, they don’t worry about
making the pieces too big.
Rather, they cut their chicken in
a seemingly random manner,
which makes for often huge, odd-
ly shaped pieces, thus adding to
the attraction. More important-
ly, the chicken is very crunchy
and not overly greasy. Though it
could be a tad spicier, and the
meat a little sweeter, these are
just minor, almost inconsequen-
tial complaints.

Also, the vegetables and
salads are fresh and delicious.
The green beans were especially
good. If there’s any room left in
your stomach, or if you're
bulimic, the pies are homemade
and taste it. I loved their pecan
pie and heard similar sen-
timents from the apple pie and
blueberry pie eaters at the table.
And Westmoreland is clean,
quiet and relaxing, yet with a
gluttonous, all-you-can-eat at-
mosphere that is reassuring. But
take your time, chew your food
and go home and crash in front

of the tube. :
Next on the line-up of spring

treats is Sweet Things, the loca-
tion of which you surely already
know. Though Sweet Things
stays open year-round, and
though ice cream theoretically
tastes the same in the winter as
it does in the summer, it takes on
special significance in the
sweating season. I'll bet that
people wearing T-shirts and lick-
ing on an ice-cream cone are

Campus Corner Records

more vulnerable to all that is
sentimental and mushy than
they are at other more regular
moments. I just finished mine,
so I’ll stop, but you know what I
mean when saying that ice
cream is special.

Let it be said that Sweet
Things offers more than just the
aura of ice cream. They make
their own ice cream, which
allows them to experiment with
any ingredient that sounds like it
would make for good ice cream.
Owners and founders Roger and
Barbara Koehler say they’ve
made about 70 different flavors
so far.

Their most popular experi-
ment to date is the Oreo-flavored
cookie ice cream, which is by far
the best seller. It’s especially
good in milk shakes, as the bits
of Oreo add that delicious sog-
giness of dipped-in-milk cookies
to the already fantastic milk
shake concept. Some of the
flavors are downright _ intri-

guing. For instance, strawberry
cheesecake, which is brand new.
It took a second Phi-bought cone
for me to be sure that I could go
ahead and recommend it.

In another perilous investiga-
tion, a butterscotch Sundae with
Heath pieces was consumed and
also enjoyed.

Evidently, people are flocking
to Sweet Things, and don’t need
much prodding. Barbara said
that between last Tuesday,
which was ugly, and the next
day, when it started getting pret-
ty, they sold 3 times more ice
cream, and have not slacked up.

In the obituaries this week is
The Ranch, which closed the
doors for good recently. Let it be
said that a good salad, a decent
steak and a hot potato could be
had there. One less option.

In the In-with-the-new depart-
ment, Spanky’s now delivers,
thus saving capitalism from an
embarrassing week.

‘Nine’ gains semis in ODACs

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team advanced to the
finals of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament
with a 1-0 extra-inning victory
over Eastern Mennonite College
in Harrisonburg yesterday.

The win was the Generals’
first ever in ODAC tournament
play.

The game featured two of the
ODAC’s premier pitchers in
W&L’s Billy White and EMC’s
Doug Byler. Both pitchers turn-
ed in excellent performances as
White gave up only four hits, no
runs and had five strikeouts and
Byler allowed only five hits and
struck out 15 General batters.

The two teams battled through
nine scoreless innings with
neither team mounting a serious
scoring threat. In the tenth inn-
ing, W&L co-captain Mike Walsh
singled to left field and advanced
to third on Kevin Golden’s
sacrifice bunt and a throwing er-

ror. Walsh was tagged out at
home plate after an unsuccessful
suicide squeeze bunt attempt.

In the eleventh inning,
freshman rightfielder Adam
Yanez tripled off the right field
wall and scored when Milam
Turner reached on an error, giv-
ing the Generals a 1-0 lead.

The Royals gave the Generals
a scare in their half of the
eleventh. White gave a single
and was relieved by righthander
Peter Detlefs. Detlefs walked
the first batter he faced but then
got the Royal batter to hit into a
game-ending double play.
Detlefs earned his second save
of the season in the game.

Golden led the Generals with
two hits.

‘This was our best game of the
year defensively,’ W&L head
coach Jim Murdock said. ‘‘Of-
fensively, we had trouble but we
were facing a very good pitcher.
We were patient at the plate. We

ends lax skid

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team blanked Roanoke
College for 37 minutes, starting
late in the first quarter, and
relied on the offense of Lee
Heimert and Rod Santomassimo
to score an 8-5 victory over the
Maroons in Salem yesterday.
The victory halted a three-game
losing skid and raised the
General’s record to 5-8. The
Maroons, ranked fifth in Divi-
sion III, dropped to 6-6.

The game marked the rever-
sal of a trend during losses to
Denison, UMBC and Saturday
against Washington, in which
W&L controlled or was even in
every statistic except the one on
the scoreboard. Yesterday, the
Generals were outshot 32-20 but
connected on a remarkably high
40 percent. Roanoke goalie Billy
Pilat had ‘only four Saves.

Coach Dennis Daly spoke
about the irony in the statistics
before yesterday's game. ‘‘Sta-
tistics are supposed to be for
losers, and we’ve been winning
face-offs, ground balls and shots
in the last three games (not in-
cluding Roanoke). We’ve been
taking plenty of shots but we
haven’t been finishing them off.
The scores certainly haven’t in-
dicated how far we’ve outshot
our opponents.”’

Maroon attackman Chris
Richardson scored from Rocco
Guglielmo near the end of the
first quarter. It was Roanoke’s
last lead, 3-2, and marked the
beginning of the long dry spell.
Heimert accounted for both
W&L goals in the opening
quarter.

In the second quarter, Mike
McAlaine flipped in a pass from
Jeff Mason with 6:20 left to even
it at 3-3. Two minutes later,

just did it.”’

White (6-1) has put together a
string of 32 innnings without giv-
ing up an earned run. White’s
earned run average now stands
at a conference leading 1.14.

“Billy has done a tremendous
job,” said Murdock. ‘I think
that the other teams are begin-
ning to realize that he is the best

pitcher in the conference.’’

In other action last week, the
Generals defeated Catholic 3-1
as White pitched a three-hitter at
Smith Field.

W&L spotted Catholic a one-
run lead in the third inning but
bounced back to tie the game in
the bottom of the inning.

overwhelming 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Max Henderson of Lynch-
burg.

At the No. 1 position, team
captain Craig Cannon lost a very
close first set against Lynch-
burg’s Buzz Frey. Cannon was
unable to establish himseli in the
second set and lost the match by
a score of 7-6 (8-6), 6-1.

Cannon and Mize formed the
championship team No. 1
doubles as they defeated Lynch-
burg’s Frey and Jim Sargent
with an impressive 6-1, 6-3 score.

Cannon and Mize will repre-
sent W&L in singles and doubles
competition at the NCAA Divi-

Emory University in Atlanta,
beginning May 9.

Senior Jim Irwin and fresh-
man Randy Johns reached the
finals of No. 2 doubles, but lost to
Lynchburg’s Henderson and
Pete Moran, 7-6, 6-2.

Irwin also reached the finals of
No. 4 singles, but he lost 6-1, 6-1
in the final, experiencing the
same fate as many W&L final-
ists: losing to a player from
Lynchburg.

W&L’s Scott Adams reached
the finals at No. 3 singles before
losing. there to Lynchburg’s
Sargent, 6-3, 6-2.

Adams played a very tough,
long and exciting first round
match against the No. 3 player
from Randolph-Macon. After
winning the first set 7-6, Adams
faced eight second set points
against him, four conseoutive
points at two different times.

First, trailing his opponent 5-4
in the second set, Adams also
trailed in the game, 3-0. Adams
won four consecutive points to
break his opponents serve and
tie the set at 5-5.

Two games later, Adams tied
the set once again at 6-6 and forc-
ed his opponent into a tie-
breaker. Adams’ opponent led
the breaker 6-2 and needed only
one point to win the set. Playing
with consistent groundstrokes,
Adams won six points in a row to
take the tiebreaker and the
match, 7-6, 7-6.

the varsity lacrosse team at
Washington and Lee, but there is
a group of lacrosse players —
the junior varsity team — that
deserves mention. Displaying
what JV. head coach Bill
McHenry calls ‘‘a good attitude
and determination,’ the JV
Generals compiled a respectable
6-3 record this year.

“T would say that though we
were undefeated last year...we
probably had a much better
team this year.”

McHenry lists a sound, consis-
tent offense with striking power
as the team’s strong point.

 

   

‘Several players come to
mind as being outstanding. Joe
Democko, a freshman, had 14
goals and 23 assists for a total of
37 points, and he only played in
eight games,’ according to
McHenry. Instead of playing in
the ninth game, Joe was moved
up to varsity.

Other high point men included
Bill Garavente, with 24 total
points on 19 goals and 5 assists,
and Bob Calabretta, who scored
9 goals and 10 assists for 19
points. Calabretta, Democko
and Garavente are freshmen,
giving McHenry even higher ex-
pectations for next year.

‘I know we have some players
that can help and will be able to
contribute to the varsity in the

for example, is a fine attack pro-
spect, but he was sidelined for
almost the entire season with a
shoulder injury. However, he
played in our last game and
scored five goals.”’

McHenry also was _ pleased

with several other members of —

the team. He cited Corky
Parkinson (7 goals, 1 assist),
Dave Seifert (4 goals, 4 assists),
Steve Giacobbe (5 goals, 1
assist), Dave Grogan (4 goals),
John Oliver (3 goals), and Chris
Sherlock (4 goals, 1 assist) as
having very good seasons.
McHenry also adds that several
defensemen had very good
seasons.

“TI would say that Vinny
Lamanna and John Poulton had
solid seasons, and our goalies
played well, too. Pete Vander-
meid played solidly until he was
sidelined with a shoulder injury.
John Church came down from
the varsity and played extreme-
ly well — he has a lot of poten-
tial.”

Looking back on the season,
McHenry seems very pleased.
The Generals played well and
though they lost three games,
they were by a total of only five
goals. In addition, the three
teams they lost to — Radford
(13-14), Boys Latin (10-11) and
Gilman (4-7) — are all teams

with exceptional talent.
One of the reasons for the

General’s success, said
McHenry, is the assistance he
has received both from the cap-
tains and from a couple of law
students.

“The tri-captains, Dave Ib-
beken, Chris Alevizatos, and
Jerry Biedronski have been very
solid and helpful to me. I feel
that with them, we have team
unity.”’

“Pete Leberman has been a
definite asset to the team and he
is very worthy of mention: He is
in his third year of law school

whole three years,’’ McHenry
said. Also helping McHenry is a

The Washington.and Lee track

this season after the ODAC Out-

Olympics’

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

..A few belated thoughts on
the baseball Commissioner-
elect, Peter Ueberroth. Not to
discount Bowie, (Lord knows, he
tried to be a dominant force in
the game, but there’s just
something about the man that
makes him akin to a pain that
pills can’t reach) but Mr. Ueber-
roth is the man for the job. His
wonders with the L.A. Olympics
have yet to fully manifest
themselves, but, believe me,
they will. The man has run an
extremely tight ship as this
year’s Summer Olympics coor-
dinator, and there’s never been
any doubt who was in charge.
Because of this ability, Ueber-
roth’s Olympics should not be
one of those overbudgeted finan-
cial disasters that we’ve seen
past Olympic shows become.
Ueberroth is also an efficient
worker, an “‘I’ll get things done
no matter what it takes’’ type.
Witness the recent fiasco with
the Russians and their ques-
tionable attache. Ueberroth took
charge of the situation and
things now appear stable. Again,
there was no doubt who the main
man was. Ueberroth is one not
afraid of stepping — or stomping
— on a few toes. And what’s
more, Ueberroth is a man who’s
earned the respect as an ad-
ministrator and director that
will allow him to take control of
the league. Major league
baseball needs someone to take
charge, not merely a bloke who
makes an attempt to assert
some authority. Peter Ueberroth
is that man. Oh George, the new
commissioner’s not afraid of you
anymore....

....Congratulations are in
order for Coach Norris Aldridge
and his track and field group for
their ODAC title and Aldridge’s
Coach-of-the-Year honors (sec-
ond time this year). As I said
last week, this championship is
just reward for this team of top-
notchers...A tip of the cap to

Lynchburg had 99 to finish third.

that NBA playoff situation. In

Jersey bunch. After displaying
the stuff of playoff veterans by

with the Buck boys will be no
waltz for the Milwaukee crew.
One thing has stayed the same,
though: L.A. is the Martina

“Once again, it was a great
team effort. We were down after
the first day, but our athletes
hung in there and gave their best
efforts,” said Aldridge.

W&L got winning perfor-
mances from Angus McBryde,
who broke the ODAC record in
the 1,500 meters (3:58.7) and
also won the 5,000 meters

may be: With Ewing et al. not in

upped his price tag. I cannot
deny the mixture of sports,
money and business but I can
say that when the athletes begin
seeing themselves as mere pro-
ducts and their guiding concern
becomes their market value,
like so many head of cattle, I
wonder if we’ve gone a bit over
the limit of common sense...

In addition, W&L had three
second-places, five thirds, three

en route to the victory.

“This may not have been my
most talented team, but I would
have to say it is my best,’’ said
Aldridge, who has coached the
W&L team for 14 years.

“We finished our regular
season undefeated (7-0) and won

our second ODAC Champion-

Tim Rock

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee’s All-
American swimmer Tim Rock
outlasted a grueling course to
win W&L’s first triathlon in less
than an hour and a half Sunday.

Anne Edmunds, a 1982 Sweet
Briar graduate, was the first
woman to finish and was third
overall. Assistant proctor Burr
Datz was first among five facul-
ty members and seventh overall.

Athletic Director William
McHenry, 51, came in fourth
among faculty and 20th overall.

The triathlon began at 9 a.m.
for the first heat and 10 a.m. for
the second. The athletes had to
swim 60 lengths in Warner
Center’s Cy Twombly Pool, bicy-
cle 13.1 miles on nearby roads
and run 3.1 miles cross country.

Rock said the course was
“unusually tough,” with hills in
strategic places and plenty of
mud to run through.

“You could tell that (Coach
Norm) Lord made up _ the
course,”’ he said.

After becoming a Division III
All-American in the 1,650
freestyle, Rock said, he trained
by concentrating on the running
and biking portions of the race.
He said he ran four miles a day
and biked 10 miles every other

day to train.
Rock’s winning time of
1:29:19.9 “will be tough to

McDonald said.

He called the event a great
success, since it went off without
a hitch and no injuries were
reported.

He said he expected the
triathlon to become an annual
event, although he hopes some-
one else will direct it.

one rush by the Maroons by
checking the ball away from
Willie Banassi. Shortly after-
ward, Roanoke was called for
pushing. Santomassimo  con-
verted on the extra-man attack
for a 5-3 advantage going into the
fourth quarter.

Heimert’s fourth unassisted
goal made it 6-3 with 11 minutes
left in the game. But Robbie
Black and Guglielmo, who used
a double screen, tallied to close
the lead to 6-5. DiDuro protected
the lead with two big saves.

John then put Santomassimo
in the clear with a long pass and
Santomassimo made the most of
a one-on-one situation to make it
7-5. Santomassimo’s second
extra-man goal, and third over
all, completed the scoring with
38 seconds left. W&L has now
beaten the Maroons five straight
times since 1979.

Saturday, the Generals lost for
the second time in as many
weeks to a Division III school
when second-ranked Washington
College rolled in the second half
to beat the Generals, 10-5.

The Sho’men’s outburst
started with Tom Gaines trickl-
ing in a rebound for a 5-3
Washington edge. It became 6-3
with 4:27 left in the third quarter
when Dan Ducar spun off Tim
Schurr and bounced it in under
DiDuro’s stick. Taylor Walker
via Gaines made it 7-3 after
three.

W&L got as close as 95 ona
backhander by Santomassimo
and Steve McGrath’s pass from
behind the goal that bounced in
off the stick of goalie Greg
Baker. Nostrant accounted for
the final score—his third goal
and fourth point of the game—
with 8:22 to go.

Jeff Mason led W&L with two
goals.

The Generals will take on

regular season game Saturday

Dear—

(continued from page 1)

Green said White ‘‘hit me in
the stomach, grabbed me by the
lapels as if he were trying to pull
me out of the chair, and then
grabbed me by the ankles and
pulled me to the floor.”’

Jenevein, who would say for
the record only that there was ‘‘a
physical attack’’ and ‘“‘at least
one form oi a violent strike,”
recalled that White said to
Green, ‘‘Don’t f--k. with me,
Green. I'll kill you; I'll kill you.”

“If you call grabbing Green by
the ankles and pulling him out of
the chair a ‘physical attack,’
then I guess I’m guilty,’’ White
said. ‘“‘The most he can Say is
that he had a few minutes of
discomfort. People fall out of
chairs all the time.”’

“Immediately, I knew two
things,” he said. ‘I knew I could
hurt him severely, and that I
shouldn’t have done it.”’

In response to a question,
White said, ‘‘No, it wash’t done
playfully.”

Jenevein called the alleged at-
tack ‘‘unprovoked’’ and Green
said it was ‘‘without question
totally unprovoked.”’

“From my vantage point, I
thought it was provoked,’’ White
said. ‘‘It was a heated discussion
and I had a real problem with
Jenevein’s and Green’s actions
at that point.”

“It’s an indication of the fact
that they’re both crybabies and
needed something to complain
about,”’ he continued. ‘‘I think to
characterize it as an unprovoked
attack is mere rhetoric.”’

Green said that after the alter-
cation, White went outside, and
later came in and said, “I
apologize if I touched you. If I
hurt your clothes, I will pay to
have them cleaned. That is all
I’m going to apologize to.”’

The two EC members said
they wrote the letters to Dean
John based on notes and dia-
grams which they made in-
dependently immediately after
the incident.

Jenevein related the incident
to President John D. Wilson in a
meeting the day after the honor
trial. “I am completely unsure
of what he has done or what he
plans to do,” Jenevein said.

‘I’m under the impression the
administration is dealing with
it,”’ he said. ‘‘I can’t claim to be
completely objective in my re-.

“They may be going a little

reason,’”’ he said.

Wanger cited a broken neck as
the cause of death.

J.O. Robinson, the state
trooper who was the first at the
accident scene, said immediate-
ly after the jncident that the
medical examiner’s office ‘‘was
not happy” with the circum-
stances of the death. Ritenour
said that foul play was being
considered in the investigation.

Although Friend was taking
medication for a colon disorder,
Wanger said that the drugs
would not have had a significant
effect on Friend.

counting of the events, so I’ll
leave the determination of fault
with the proper authorities.”’

White has served as_ the
school’s director of minority af-
fairs since 1979, and so is listed
as one of the ‘‘administrative of-
ficers’’ of Washington and Lee.
In addition, he is a second year
law student.

The ‘White Book” on the
Honor System specifies that
“the advisers must be members
of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body.”’

“If they want to take me in to
Student Control, then so be it,”’
White said. ‘‘If they’re trying to
link it up to my administrative
capacity, I think personally
that’s a little cheap.”’

“*My problem is that under the
White Book, I could only defend

determine why Friend was in
Keysville that night. Tony War-
ren, a longtime friend and
classmate of Friend’s since high
school, said that Hampden-
Sydney students occasionally
ate at a restaurant there.
Ritenour said that students had
told him that Friend was ‘‘an
avid turkey hunter” and that he
may have been in the area sear-
ching for hunting locations.
Hampden-Sydney Dean of
Students Lewis Drew said that
he had met with 15 students in-
dividually to try to reconstruct
Friend’s activities that day. He
said that despite these meetings,

larger group meetings and
several conferences’ with
Friend’s parents, the cir-

cumstances of the day are still
unclear.

 

[the accused] as a student....
Anything I did in that connection
— good, bad or indifferent —
would be as a student,’’ White
continued. “Otherwise, [the ac-
cused]’s trial is null and void
and he should be called back and
retried with an appropriate
counsel.”’

“T think it was a violation of
the spirit of the Honor System
for White to serve as an ad-
vocate,’’ Jenevein said.

“I’m sure that when the re-
quirement that students serve as
advocates was drafted, they
didn’t anticipate an ad-
ministrator serving in a dual
role,’’ he added. ‘‘John White is
a member of the administration
—period. I don’t think we can
overlook that in evaluating his
actions.”’

 

“We are trying to get all the in-
formation we can to get a com-
plete picture,” Drew said. ‘So
far the investigation is still in-
complete.”’

Friend left home the morning
of the accident about 9 a.m. but
did not attend classes, according
to Drew. One student at first
thought he saw Friend in the
library around 11 a.m. but later
said he was unsure, Drew said.

Friend stopped at a Chase City
gas station at 6 p.m. and was not
seen again until he was killed at
7:45 p.m.

Friend was a member of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity, but
Drew is adamant that his death
was not related to the fraternity.

‘There is absolutely no frater-
nity connection whatsoever,’’ he
said.

 

 

 

 

 

“It is very hard for him not to
be viewed as an administrator,”’
Green said. ‘‘You can’t hide one
capacity.”’

“Tl am caught,”’ White said in
an earlier interview. ‘‘I thought I
was defending [the accused] as
a student. I can see now that
what I did or might have done
could have implications on my
position here at the school.”’

“I can say in my own defense
that I would not do anything to
undermine the Honor System,”
he said. ‘‘To me it was a matter
of ethics and consciousness pure
and simple — the principle that
everyone is entitled to a
defense.”’

A proposal to allow the accus-
ed to make an opening statement
in the closed hearing was re-
jected also by an 8-1 vote with
two abstentions.

Judge said that the accused

he now can ‘say in the closing

The EC also approved a revi-
