EC holds candidate forum

President

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Communication between the
Executive Committee and the
student body, student apathy
and the honor system were the
major points of discussion dur-
ing yesterday’s debate between
the two candidates for EC
President.

Juniors Cole Dawson and
Darby Brower, both represen-
tatives on this year’s EC, field-
ed questions from the audience
at the forum. Possibly the most
difficulty the candidates en-
countered during the forum
arose when the two were asked
to differentiate between
themselves.

Brower, serving his second
consecutive year on the EC,
said, ‘‘I do not like to be pointed
out as a politician. I’m a little
too insecure for that.”

He added that he isn’t seeking
the job merely to improve his
personal qualifications. “I’m
more concerned with what’s go-
ing on right now than with the
future,”’ he said.

Brower described himself as

Vice President

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Vice presidential candidate
Peter A. Baumgaertner said
Wednesday that the scope of
potential honor violations
should be limited to lying,
cheating and stealing. -

That position was an unusual
moment at the “Big Three’
forum, which otherwise was
dominated by the expression of
closely parallel views on a wide
range of issues.

The three candidates for vice
president are Baumgaertner, a
first-year law student; David N.
Jonson, a junior U.S. history
major; and James A. White, a
sophomore business adminis-
tration major who currently is a
member of the Executive Com-
mittee.

The chief function of the Vice
president is to manage the
disbursement of student body
funds, and the vice president
traditionally handles the ad-
ministrative aspects of honor
matters.

Witnesses have
some protection

Immunity possible in grand jury

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

A number of immunity op-
tions and other protections are
available to witnesses who
testify for the special grand
jury investigating drug traffick-
ing in-the Rockbridge area, ac-
cording to information gathered
from lawyers, law professors
and legal research.

The panel has summoned
over a dozen Washington and
Lee students, and many mem-
bers of the local legal communi-
ty believe that a number more
will be called before the in-
vestigative body provides its
recommendations to a regular
grand jury, which can then
issue indictments.

The earliest that could hap-
pen is May 7, which is just over
six months after the special
grand jury was convened.

A key legal principle that
someone who has been sub-
poenaed should remember is
that he must testify if called,
although he is not required to
provide self-incriminatory in-
formation.

However, if the prosecutor
grants the witness immunity

from prosecution, he can then
be compelled to provide full
testimony.

The Code of Virginia
specifically provides that any
witness appearing before a
special grand jury has the right
to have his lawyer present.

News
Analysis

The attorney may ‘‘consult
with and advise” his client dur-
ing the examination, but the
lawyer does not have the right
to conduct his own questioning
of the witness.

“I really recommend that
people appearing before the
drug grand jury take counsel
with them,’’ said one Lexington
defense attorney. ‘‘And that’s
not just to line our pockets.

“People are going into un-
familiar surroundings, they’re
nervous, and they’re not being
told what their rights are.”

Professor William S. Geimer,
who teaches criminal law at
Washington and Lee’s Law
School, voiced similar con-
cerns.

IFC to consider closed parties

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Independents at Washington
and Lee University may not be
able to attend fraternity par-
ties if a proposal before the In-
terfraternity Council is
adopted.

The IFC considered a policy
at Monday’s meeting forbid-
ding independents from atten-
ding sanctioned fraternity par-
ties without an invitation.

The proposition represents a
change in IFC policy which cur-
rently states that traternities
are permitted to close only two

parties per year.

The IFC will vote on the pro-
posal at its next meeting in the
University Center March 6, at
7p.m.,

IFC President Emery Ell-
inger said the restriction is in-
tended to form a generally
understood policy concerning
independents’ attendance at
fraternity parties. Ellinger
cited several reasons for the
proposal.

First, he pointed out the
financial burden placed on
fraternity members.

In regard to a ruling by the

Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board that prohibits frater-
nities from charging any non-
fraternity members who at-
tend their parties, Ellinger
said. ‘‘We think we are hurting
ourselves.”

Referring to a _ statement
made by an alumnus here at
W&L, Ellinger said, ‘‘Inde-
pendents are getting the best
deal in town.”’

Ellinger added that not only
is the non-fraternity atten-
dance financially burdensome,
but it might be affecting the

Review and Outlook

 
 

Closing Up?

In last week’s Interfraternity Council meeting, a
proposal was discussed that, if passed, would prohibit
independents from attending fraternity parties
without an invitation.

Although fraternities certainly have the right to
restrict attendance at their parties, something should
be said about the casual — if not always friendly —
relationship that has existed between fraternity
members and independents. In the past, there seems
to have been a nice social balance in which in-
dependents visited the fraternities with the exception
of the two closed parties each year. This social cir-
culation is an excellent means of stimulating campus-
wide discussion. It would be a shame to stifle such
discussion in a time of University transition and
uneasiness.

It is also very important to consider the actual
degree of change that would occur. Whereas now only
two parties may be closed, a significant jump would
be made to having all parties closed. It is important to
remember that independents could attend parties
with an invitation. By the same token, though, an im-
portant question to ask is whether such a blanket
policy is necessary or whether an intermediate
measure might be more equitable.

The IFC will vote on this proposal Tuesday. Bet-
ween now and then, it is necessary that fraternity
members discuss this matter among themselves as
well as with independents.

Earlier this year, the Executive Committee
discovered the pitfalls of operating with less than
complete student representation. We think it is impor-
tant for the Interfraternity Council to determine stu-
dent opinion to the greatest practical extent before

making a decision.

One of the IFC’s reasons behind the proposal is to
lower the financial burden on fraternity members.
_ The members would do well to consider the intrinsic
benefits they may forfeit.

Politics films draw appreciation

To the Editors:

The Washington and Lee
University Department of
Politics is to be commended for
the excellent fare that it is offer-
ing in the form of free cinematic
entertainment this winter —
The Politics Film Festival. Pro-
fessor Craig McCaughrin’s con-
cise introductions to the various
films are informative and

thought-provoking; the films
themselves are riveting works
of political insight.

Yet on Wednesday evening,
Feb. 22, the Leni Riefenstahl
classic, ‘‘Triumph of the Will,”
became suddenly less riveting
when the gentleman to my im-
mediate left slipped off his
shoes and propped up his
stocking-clad feet on the desk in

Patterson draws support

To the Editors:

The elections for the “Big
Three” positions of the Ex-
ecutive Committee are Mon-
day, March 5. I recommend to
all students Nelson Patterson
for Secretary of the Executive
Committee.

Mr. Patterson has proven his
leadership ability and dedica-
tion to the University in several
capacities. The Executive Com-
mittee has, for the past two
years, appointed Mr. Patterson
to the Student Health Commit-

tee. In addition, Mr. Patterson
is presently the Vice-president
of the International Club, the
Executive Director of the Col-
lege Republicans, and the head
of sophomore accounts for the
Student Telephone Union.

I am confident that Nelson
Patterson will work for a fair
distribution of student funds

and uphold the system of honor
we all enjoy.

Election awareness

To the Editors:

The upcoming election
presents a chance for the W&L
student body to change student
government policy, a policy
which has been leading W&L in-
to the realm of mediocrity and
eliminating the chance to ex-
perience a liberal, enlightening
education. We have the chance
to bring W&L into the twentieth
century, however painful it may
be. But we have this chance on-
ly if we, the students, become
actively aware and educated as
to the positions of each of the
candidates, voting on this
premise and not that of mere
popularity. Otherwise, we will
continue to be governed by
“Good Ol’ Boys,”’ unwilling to
support and strive for progress,
and apt to utilize tradition as an
excuse for progress.

The power of the Executive
Committee is vast and far-
reaching; thus, it would be to
the advantage, of all pro-
gressive-minded students at
W&L to become familiar with

the positions held by can-
didates, particularly on issues
which could determine wether
W&L is to progress as an
academically strong and com-
petitive institution, or to wallow
in stagnant traditionalism. The
impending issue of coeducation
is one example which em-
phasizes this need for ‘‘can-
didate awareness.” Students
have the opportunity to elect a
student government which can
be open and supportive to a pro-
gressive measure such as this
one, and finally boost W&L into
the position that it deserves in
the ranks of higher education.
But all good things must
start.

front of him, The room was not
well ventilated.

Shortly thereafter I took my
leave, wondering to myself: if
this is the way this fellow reacts
to film footage of lots of
Aryan/master-race types
scrubbing and shaving them-
selves into a cleanly frenzy in
preparation for a Nazi rally,
who will he react to the unwash-
ed Bedouins of “Lawrence of
Arabia” (the next-scheduled
film), who must go for weeks
without bathing for fear of be-
ing blasted to smithereens by
an irate Omar Sharif keeping
watch over his sacred vasis?
Two possibilities, I figure.
Either 1) he will come in smell-
ing like a rose, or 2) he will
prepare himself by a) not
changing his socks from now
until the showing of
‘“‘Lawrence..” and b) eating fif-
ty bowls of baked beans shortly
before showtime, and declaring
“No prisoners!’ upon entering
room 327 of the Commerce
School on that fateful eve.

Although I was not particular-
ly smitten by the the Executive
Committee’s recent ‘‘necktie in-
itiative,” in light of recent
events I might be very recep-
tive to a ‘‘shoe initiative’ as a
means of clearing the air, so to
speak, of the vaporous degen-

eracy that is sweeping the cam-
pus.

W&L’s real traditions: past, present and future

By TOM CONNORS
Phi Columnist

The word “‘tradition” has

been thrown about quite a bit -

lately. It is one of those
strange political words that
changes implications from per-
son to person. At W&L we
often associate it with the aura
of honor surrounding the name
of Robert E. Lee. Lee’s name
ought not to be used to defend
unjust traditions, though, for
he was no opponent of change.
For example, at the outset of
the Civil War, he advised
President Davis to begin free-
ing the Confederate slaves

My View

gradually. While he presided
here, he reviewed our tradi-
tions, strengthening and
establishing worthy ones and
abolishing harmful ones. That
we ought to attempt achieving
the same balance is hardly an
assertion of any depth.

On vast theoretical plains,

 

tradition may seem fairly cut —

and dried. However, specifics
tend to mess things up in real
life. Anything old, young, or as
yet unborn may be classified
as tradition (or tradition to
be), given a narrator of near-
average skill. As proof of this,
I put forth the following obser-
vations, tenuously united under
the abusively broad heading of
tradition.

Speaking. The speaking
tradition fell ill during the
1960s around the same time the
dress code was laid to rest.
Both traditions had a common
cause for their downfall: the
expression of freedom from
the conventions of the
establishment pigs. Today
such a reason fails to stir any
feelings besides nostalgia or
regret.

A decade and a half later,
the tradition seems to be a lost
cause. Here is a far more no-
ble tradition than most. We are
a small school; the speaking
tradition emphasizes that we
are not in New York City. Our
community is a place where
walking need not be associated
with combat.

However, the fashionable big
city attitude is gaining fast. A
cold, cruel world surrounds us.
We hope not to be taken for
weak or sentimental gentle-
men. Unfortunately, no ex
cathedra proclamation, en-
couraging or threatening, by
the Executive Committee is
likely to restore this tradition.
Now, its future lies in ex-
amples set by individuals.

We might remember that
many of the unfamiliar
wanderers on campus are here
to honor Robert E. Lee. With
this in mind, and mindful that
we are (by apostolic succes-
sion of sorts) the General’s
“boys,”’ we would do well to

treat his guests well (and those
students, faculty and employ-
ees associated with his school
as well.) Then visitors could
take away a sense of the quiet
dignity of Lee’s South in addi-
tion to postcards of Lee
Chapel.

Drinking. One of W&L’s
oldest and most secure tradi-
tions is drinking. It is a subject
I am loath to raise and one
I’m not sure I can discuss
without evading issues.

When the cornerstone of
Washington Hall was laid —
sometime around 1824 or so —
“‘Jockey’’ Robinson threw us a
good party, even by present
standards. This was the
earliest recorded W&L bash as
far as I know. Anyway, Jockey
had sent us a keg of home-
made whiskey (and good
whiskey at that). Our
forebears here drank with
vigor enough to match our
own. When the line for the
spiked keg grew too long, too
slow or too something, the
party-goers determined to
speed things up — namely by
breaking open the keg’s top.
This allowed them to dip into it
with cups, ladles or whatever
was handy. In the onslaught
that followed, the keg over-
turned and the rest of the
whiskey lost.

Is there a moral here? I
doubt it. Jockey got all hacked
off. Later, he donated Robin-
son Hall, so his faith in us
couldn’t have been too deeply
damaged. Well, the point is
that the tradition is long-
standing. And when you next
walk across the front lawn,
you might try to think of an
empty hill and a keg of
whiskey still in service amidst
a rowdy gathering. And when
you pass the monument out
front of Tucker Hall, wonder
whether Jockey, now in his
grave, still finds our drinking
disquieting.

I don’t want to end drinking
at W&L; anyone who knows
me will laugh at the sugges-
tion. But maybe we could play
the hard guy a bit less often.

Independent Union. Since the
“EC still solicits any sugges-
tions for improving the W&L
experience for independents,”
I would like to help promote a
sound proposal (which aims to
begin a new tradition). The IU
(with which I have no connec-
tion) is organized by in
dependents and has given solid
ideas for arousing interest and
support: newsletters, meet-
ings, road trips, mailings,
bands, ets. etc. Furthermore,
the two co-chairmen are ob-
viously willing and young
enough (that is, not about to
graduate) to provide needed
energy, despite lack of en-
couragement from the EC. To
ask for funds to get such a
union started ought not to be
considered extraordinary.

It has been pointed out that
senior EC members have in-

dependent friends who are
cynical of the proposal. Why
shouldn’t they be? (The idea of
‘independent friends’’ seems

akin to such phrases as ‘‘some

of my best friends are...’’) In-
dependents have been ignored,

nicknamed ‘“‘GDIs’” (granted,
mostly in good humor), and
have noticed a certain amount
of disdain from the pillars of
the frat and student govern-
ment system. Certainly, the
EC’s insulting and sarcastic
response to, the IU’s request
and the later defenses of that
action are prime examples of
such behavior. Need I point out
that the student cynicism
referred to in the EC defense
is also the main cause of the
student apathy that the same
EC wishes to. see disappear?
Throwing water on sparks of
student enthusiasm and ambi-
tion will not generally aid the
cause of anyone fighting stu-
dent apathy. May the EC
reconsider. I hope the con-
troversy will not die until that
occurs.

Tea Lady. I can say from ex-
perience that the ‘round the
clock library goes back to 1980
at least. Most of us know that
the library is the best place in

town to get away from the
distractions of home and to the
distractions of the library. I
remember hearing the library
aptly described as ‘study car-
rels for 600 and sleeping for
1000.”

The library is also home to a
large number of W&L tea
societies who avoid Milton,
Keynes, Heidegger, Kepler and
Einstein by discussing any-
thing else. Until about 1970, a
woman was provided to serve
tea to these gentlemen (and
those gentlemen studying there
as well). She sharpened pen-
cils on the side.

Here is a tradition we would
do well to restore. Perhaps the
proposed new secretary for
student activities could func-
tion primarily as a “‘tea-lady”’
during peak library hours. She
could act as secretary in the
ume formerly alotted for pen-
cil sharpening. This certainly
is a way to serve a lot of
students in a positive manner.

Having looked at four
specific W&L traditions, four
different types of tradition
may be recognized: those that
ought to be strengthened,
reviewed, established or

reestablished. Like anything
worthwhile, tradition requires
balance if it is to promote
positive values.

This year we have had a
good many debates over tradi-
tions. If this is a sound time
for us to reexamine our tradi-
tions, why shouldn’t we? I
think this is a good time to do
so. In terms of academics,
reputation and finance, Presi-
dent Huntley left to his suc-
cessor a university in excellent
shape. The last ‘‘major’’
changes came about during the
late 60s; we are a different
generation with a new outlook.
In these debates we should
remember the rules. of
gentlemen undertaking such
tasks.

Respect is the key quality in
a gentleman. At a recent EC
debate during the Tie Crisis, I
found the childish disrespect
on both sides distasteful and
embarrassing. Even a little
disrespect for one’s opponent
is excessive; it only hurts the
defended cause. I have found a
lack of mutual respect on near-
ly every side of a ques-
tion. May we rise above it and
debate such questions rational-
ly and without haste.

Midterm review raises questions

By SCOTT MASON

Things had been calm for the
Executive Committee this
year...that is, until about six
weeks ago. With the controver-
sy over Independent Union
funding and the great necktie
saga, the EC has come under a
barrage of criticism. The calm
proved to be merely the calm
before the storm.

And storm it did. Letters
criticizing the EC and its con-
troversial decisions poured in-
to The Ring-tum Phi, while
verbal assaults “‘rained’’ upon
some committee members’
heads.

But the greatest blow to the
EC may have come from The
Ring-tum Phi. In the Phi’s
yearly review of individual Ex-
ecutive Committee members
(Feb. 9 issue), several
representatives were dragged
through the mud, criticized for
their lack of effectiveness as
EC representatives.

What is troublesome to many
is the power given the reporter
who writes the reviews. The
reporter has the ability not on-
ly to embarrass a represen-
tative with a negative review,
but can also ruin that repre-
sentative’s chances of winning
a student election if he ever
decides to run for office again.
Negative reviews are not easi-
ly forgotten by students who
depend upon The Ring-tum Phi
for EC coverage.

Sophomore representative
Ken Lindeman was a victim
this year of one of those

negative reviews. Among other
things, Lindeman was said to
have missed ‘crucial’
meetings.

Lindeman has since said the
“‘charges”’ were unfair, that he
missed the meetings because
he was sick and because of a
physical education class in ski-
ing that he would have
flunked had he skipped it.

Phi News Editor Bruce Pot-
ter, who wrote the reviews,
hadn’t known of Lindeman’s
illness but he had known of
Lindeman’s skiing class.

Reader’s
Advocate

Potter said his review was
accurate, that he interposed no
judgment of Lindeman as an
EC representative, good or
bad, when he wrote of
Lindeman’s absences. ‘I
haven’t said that, because he
missed three meetings, he’s a
totally useless EC member,”’
Potter said. ‘‘What I tried to
do was to present the facts and
let the students make the deci-
sion.”

But that’s not the way Ring-
tum Phi Chief Editor John
Cleghorn sees it. He thought
Potter’s review of Lindeman
was unjustifiably severe since
Potter hadn’t known the
reasons for Lindeman’s ab-
sences. ‘“‘We made a mistake,”’

 

 

Cleghorn said. ‘‘He (Potter)
was not doing a complete job
of reporting. He needed to ask
Ken why he missed those
meetings.”

Potter agrees with Cleghorn
in retrospect but said the time
constraints simply made it im-
possible to interview each
representative.

There’s more than one issue
invovled in all this, it seems.
How should a reporter go
about writing annual EC re-
views. Should he make the time
to interview each repre-
sentative, find out why a
representative is quiet, why
he’s ineffective, why he misses
meetings? Or should the
reporter rely on his personal
observations and on the facts,
on what a representative has
said and done, what sub-
committees he’s been on, what
issues he’s raised? Further,
should there even be EC
reviews: should the reporter
be given the potential to ruin a
representative’s future poli-
tical career?

A lot of questions can be
asked. But what Ken Linde-
man wants to know is why he
was given, in his opinion, a
bad review. He may never
know why.

Meanwhile, the storm that
had been hovering over the EC
has seemingly passed, and
criticism has subsided. It is
the Phi that this time should
have been the ones to bear the
brunt of those criticisms, for
carelessness and lack of
thorough reporting.

Lack of poll watchers causes EC controversy

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee’s
failure to obtain a Voting
Regulations Board chairman
has resulted in confusion and
controversy over who should be
in charge of obtaining students
to man the polls during Mon-
day’s Big Three elections.

Pete Baumgaertner and Dave
Jonson, two vice-presidential
candidates, complained at Mon-
day’s EC meeting about up-
perclass law _ representative
Jim Green’s manning the polls.
Baumgaertner charged that
Green had actively campaigned
in the law school for two can-
didates, and that his presence
at the polls would remind voters
of those candidates.

Despite motions not to allow
any EC members to man the
polls and not to allow Green to
man the law school polls, the
issue was resolved with a
recommendation by President

 

Bob Jenevein that ‘‘the two co-
chairmen (Green and senior
representative Jim Messer) do
everything they can not to man
the polls themselves.”’

The debate over who should
man the polls began when the 10
candidates presented their peti-
tions at the beginning of the
meeting, and Jenevein re-
viewed the election rules.

Baumgaertner then com-
plained about Green’s manning
the polls and Green responded
by saying that he did not know
until Monday that he would be
in charge of obtaining poll-
watchers for the law school.
“From this point on, I can
assure you I will be totally
oblivious, or neutral, to the pro-
ceedings,’’ he said.

When Jenevein later asked
him if he would “have any prob-
lem being objective,’ Green
answered, ‘‘No.”

Nevertheless, Howard made
a motion that no EC member be
allowed to man the polls, but it

died because it was not second-
ed. ‘‘My concern is that we’re
going to have unmanned polls,”’
Jenevein said.

Green and Messer were given
the polling responsibility
because the EC has yet to find a
VRB chairman to_ replace
Burns Newsome, who is not at
W&L this semester. The only
application received for the
position was rejected.

This produces a situation,
Baumgaertner said, in which
“you have EC members run-
ning their own elections.”

Although Green gave his
“personal honor’’ not to cam-
paign while at the polls,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers made a motion
that Green not be allowed to
man the law school polls and
that Messer not be allowed to
man the undergraduate campus
polls. He later changed it to just
preventing Green from mann-
ing the law school polls.

Green pointed out that,
because of classes, he didn’t
have time to man the polls
himself and would try to find
other people to man them.

“T think we’re really getting a

tempest in a teapot here,” he _

said, before Jenevein’s recom-
mendation.
Debate over who should man

the polls highlighted both the
beginning and the end of the
meeting and overshadowed the
first and second freezing of
funds by the EC this year.

The Film Society, originally
scheduled to report at the Feb. 6
meeting, which was postponed
because of the public honor
trial, presented a written report
but had no one at the meeting to
answer questions.

Senior representative Jim
Messer’s motion to freeze the
society’s funds was approved
9-1-1, with secretary Len
Howard against and Green ab-
staining. The Film Society thus
became the first organization

’ this year to lose its student body

funds until it reports in person
to the EC.

  
  
     

Only moments later, though,
the Hockey Club also had its
funds frozen. Peter Muller was
at the meeting to answer ques-
tions, but no written report had
been prepared.

A first vote on the motion to
freeze the Hockey Club’s funds
resulted in a 5-5-1 tie, with
Messer, junior representatives
Darby Brower and Cole
Dawson, Jenevein and Vice-
president Dave Judge voting to
freeze the funds, and Green abs-
taining.

Judge said the EC couldn’t
freeze the Film Society’s funds
and not the Hockey Club’s. “I
think we’re showing a lack of
uniformity,”’ he said. ‘‘We’re
just being arbitrary.”

Howard disagreed: ‘‘The pur-
pose of freezing funds is to deter
the chronic failure to show up
that some clubs have. If the
Hockey Club knows - (they’re
supposed to be here), there’s no
point in our freezing their funds
to draw attention to it.’’

After a few minutes of listen-
ing to what he described as
“eloquence,’’ Green changed
his vote to support freezing the
funds, a motion that then pass-
ed 6-5.

The EC also heard several
budget reports, including that
of the 1984 Mock Democratic
Convention, Monday night. Co-
chairman Peter Muller _re-
ported that Saturday’s pavilion
party “‘lived up to our highest
expectations,’’ and that the
Mock Convention expected to
raise about $1,000 from it.

Not counting funds earned
from the party, the Mock Con-
vention has raised 76 percent,
or $77,974, of its goal. Co
chairman Steve Lewis said that
money earned from suppliers,
journal advertisements and
memorabilia sales would in-
crease the total raised to about
94 percent of the goal.

“We are in really strong
financial shape,”’ Lewis said,
although he added that the Con-
vention has. been unable to
secure a keynote speaker yet.

The EC also heard budget
reportes from the Calyx, which
announced that three frater-
nities still had not paid for last
year’s yearbook picture; the In-
ternational Club, which tied for
the second best delegation at
the Model UN at Princeton in
February; and the Fencing
Club.

A Sunday night blaze at 456
Lime Kiln Road forced five
Washington and Lee students
to seek new housing and
caused smoke and water
damage to four of the students’
belongings.

Juniors Michael Cregan and
Dick Minnich were a

Brooks, returning to the house,
saw smoke on the second floor,

next door to telephone the fire

scene. Irvine said about 20-30
minutes were required to bring
the fire under control and that
no injuries were reported.

James A. Jones, owner of
the house, said he had asked
two contractors for estimates
on the damage but would not
receive any response until the
end of the week.

Asked to estimate the
damage, Jones said a
“‘guesstimate’’ would be be-
tween $15,000 and $25,000, not
including damages to the
students’ property.

Junior Kevin McClatchey,
who returned from the W&L
library to the house about 11
p.m. with the fifth resident,
John Lee Graves, said his and
Graves’ belongings suffered
some smoke damage.

Minnich, in whose room the
fire started, ‘‘lost every-
thing...except his class ring,”
McClatchey said.

McClatchey added that the

students expected their
parents’ personal property in-
surance to cover most of the
damages.

The fire apparently started
when a desk lamp on the arm
of a sofa in Minnich’s room fell
onto the sofa. The lamp,
turned on at the time, caused
the sofa to catch fire, Irvine
said.

Because Minnich’s room is
at the front of the second floor
and the television room at the
back of the first floor,
McClatchey said, Cregan and
Minnich did not realize the
house was on fire until] Brooks
came home.

Brooks tried to go up the
stairs but was turned away by
the smoke. He did manage to
rescue Cregan’s_ stereo,
though, McClatchey said.

Brooks, Cregan and Minnich
then went outside and saw the
windows in Minnich’s room
blow out.

Brooks’ room suffered no
damage, McClatchey said.
However, Cregan’s first-floor
room suffered water damage
when a fireman, moving the
burned sofa from Minnich’s
room directly above Cregan’s,

stepped through the floor,
causing water to drain into
Cregan’s room.

Although Jones had _in-
surance on the house, “‘it is go-
ing to cost me money,” he
said, “‘because I still have to
pay the mortgage and I won’t
have any rental income.”’

The five students are living
with friends this week, and
McClatchey, Graves and Min-
nich expect to move into
another house soon.

Jones said the fire wasn’t the
students’ fault. ‘‘There was no
negligence,’’ he added. “‘If this
is bad luck, good luck might
have prevented it. With some
good luck, it might never have
happened.”

Committee to issue study on
proposed fraternity changes

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

An ad hoc committee ap-
pointed to study several aspects
of fraternity life at Washington
and Lee will issue its report
within the next few weeks, Dr.
John M. Evans, chairman of the
committee, said Tuesday.

“We're not recommending
anything revolutionary. They
are just housekeeping proposals
on things they can do better,”’
Evans said.

Evans did not want to com-
ment on any specific recom-
mendations the committee was
making because the group was
still in the process of determin-
ing what the final recommenda-
tions would be.

Evans cited five issues the
committee was to consider:
physical condition and ap
pearance of fraternity houses,
the sophomore monopoly of
fraternity residences, the dura-

   

tion and character of midweek
parties, security problems aris-
ing from open parties and the
timing and character of Rush.
“The committee was not
designed to attack fraternities,
but to make them work more ef-
ficiently. The goal is to
strengthen the system and to
avoid drastic conflicts between
the fraternities, the university

and the community,” Evans
said.

The committee began meet-
ing in the fall, and for the last
two months the committee has
been meeting about twice a
week, Evans reported

“‘We’re coming to a conclu-
sion now, and we're fine-tuning
our recommendations,’’ Evans
said.

thought this year’s EC listened
to the students, but when
students’ views overrode their
own, they voted their cons-
ciences. Dalton said he would
vote the students’ views
whether or not they coincided
with his own.

Monyek asserted that he
didn’t like labels. Monyek add-
ed that he thought the “key to
communication was visibility.”’

Rikhoff stresses that he would
bring an “objective and logical
voice which represents the en-
tire student body and the
University’s ideals.”’ Rikhoff
said he wants to put the EC in
its proper jurisdiction, in
reference to EC decisions con-
cerning drug-dealing and the
necktie issue.

Sophomore Nelson Patterson
pledged to bring ‘‘a new voice”’
to the committee and called for
a second-year law represen-
tative as well as a guaranteed
Big Three position for a law stu-
dent. Currently there is only a
freshman law representative
and an upperclass law
representative. No Big Three
offices are allotted to a par-
ticular class.

Dawson called for increased
communication between the EC
and the student body. ‘‘One of
the biggest problems I’ve found
this year was communication
with the student body,” he said.

Dawson later called for a poll

of student opinion on all major
issues, but not too frequently.
“Trying to tap the student body
through polls too often cuts
down on their effectiveness,’’ he
said.

Brower said improving the
communication process should
begin with better orientation
programs for freshmen and for
first-year law students and also
a better relationship with the
faculty.

Brower called for more com-
bined efforts between subcom-
mittees to reduce student
apathy. He cited as examples
the Independent Union working
with the Student Activities
Board and the Mock Convention
working with Contact.

IU seeks

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Despite being denied funds
by the Executive Committee
earlier in the semester, the In-
dependent Union met Tuesday
evening to discuss possible
social events and sign up for
intramural athletics.

Although lack of funding has
‘changed the game plan
slightly,” according to IU co-
chairman Jim Sarle, his goals
for independents remain basic-
ally the same.

‘‘Previously, it was my hope
that we could generate some
ideas and put them into prac-
tice with the money we had
hoped to get from the EC.

Brower said, ‘‘to get them away
from their more familiar
ground.”

Brower defined the present
Rush system as a major con-
tributor to apathy because it
breaks up the freshman class
before students have a chance
to get to know one another.
Although he said he doesn’t sup-
port moving Rush to winter
term, he said he would like to
see it extended over a six-week
period.

The present system, under
which a student has to make a
decision in four weeks, is not
healthy, Brower said.

Dawson disagreed, though,
saying, ‘‘Rush is one of the
more positive aspects as far as
combating student apathy. I
mean, not to knock what you’re
saying, Darby. :

“For me, the apathy is that
the students aren’t completely
aware of the honor system and
what they’re taking part in,’’
Dawson added.

He would emphasize ‘‘the
more positive aspects of the

honor system” and ‘‘the tradi-
tions of W&L” during orienta-
tion and in the EC President’s
letter to incoming freshmen.

Dawson defended the EC’s
decision last fall to declare that
drug dealing may be considered
dishonorable. ‘“‘Drug dealing is
a dishonorable act, as far as I
am concerned,” he said.

“T just don’t think that fosters
a good, secure feeling within the
community. It might be a stu-
dent control matter; it might be
anEC matter. Each case should
be assessed on its particular
merits.”

Brower also called for more
student respect toward the
honor system. ‘The students
feel that we’re the masters of
the honor system and that we
run them, whereas it’s really
the other way around,” he said.
“We serve them, and they’re
the body of the honor system.”

“I want this school to be a
good, working community and
for every person to feel he can
trust everyone else who’s walk-
ing around,” Brower added.

ideas and funds

Ideally, I’d still like to do the
same things,”’ said Sarle.

Seventeen students came to
the IU’s meeting, including An-
drew Caruthers, the freshman
EC representative recently ap-
pointed to the IU as an ad h
member. :

At the meeting Sarle express-
ed his fear that the financial
situation may have caused a
waning of interest, as -in-
dicated by Tuesday’s small
turnout compared to two
earlier meetings. Most of the
hour-long gathering was spent
discussing dues and _ social
functions, along with a sign-up
for intramural basketball,
volleyball and soccer.

“To collect dues...would be a
tremendous asset to the IU,”
said Caruthers, who noted that
this would show the EC and
the Student’ Activities Board
that there is a firm commit-
ment.

The SAB would be open to IU
suggestions, Caruthers said,
adding ‘‘I’d appreciate sugges-
tions. I’m free to talk to
anyone about anything at any
time.”

In a Jan. 26 letter to the Phi
members EC president Robert
C. Jenevein said he did not ex-
pect the IU to collect any dues.

“The EC will again act on its
belief that real interest will
generate real income. I do not
expect the IU to collect any
dues,’’ wrote Jenevein.

Sarle, who hopes to attract
_25 to 50 dues-paying members,
expressed his desire to collect
$5 from each union member
next year. ‘I would like to at-
tempt to collect...$2 from
members for the rest of the
year,”’ he said, and a consen-
sus seemed to favor the idea,
although no actual vote was
taken.

Sarle feels the dues is
necessary more as an indica-
tion of student interest than as
a money-maker.

The rest of the meeting was
spent discussing possible up-
coming activities including
parties with women’s schools
and trips to lacrosse games
and concerts.

There is about $60 in the IU
coffers, according to Sarle,
who received a $75 check from
Dean of Students Lewis G.
John in late January. Since
then, the IU has spent money
contacting students about in-
tramurals and printing flyers.

Movie Review

 

‘Terms’ is
endearing

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

Let it be known that for the
first time since I have been
writing reviews about flicks in
Lexington, I have nothing horri-
ble to say about a movie. “Im-
possible,” you say? Go see
Terms of Endearment for
yourself and try to find a part
bad enough to quarrel with.
That’s right, you can’t find a
New Yorker with good man-
ners, either. (Sorry, guys, it’s a
quote from the movie.)

This movie deserves all the
accolades and awards it has
already garnered and is poised
to receive. I won’t pretend to be
able to elaborate on exactly
why Terms of Endearment is so
good, other than that one gets
the feeling that it was exquisite-
ly handled in every detail.

The performances of the prin-
ciple characters, Aurora
(Shirley McClaine), the eccen-
tric Texan momma; Emma
(Debra Winger), Aurora’s

 

daughter and the movie’s chief

heart-wringer; Flap Horton
(Danny DeVito), the English
professor-husband who sees to
be trying to emulate one of
Shakespeare’s tragic figures;
and Craig Breedlove (Jack
Nicholson), a boozing,
teenager-chasing, widow-
wooing, swimmer-ex-astronaut
extraordinaire — are all of the
caliber that probably should be
seen several times to be fully
appreciated.

I have just viewed Terms for
the third time, and each time
has been one of. wonderful in-
dulgence, sitting for two and a
half hours as these characters
and their stories subtlely
manipulate the audience. Terms
of Endearment runs the gamut of
emotional experience, and _ it
may make some viewers pout a
bit at being handled so roughly
at the end, but it is worth it.

My advice to the W&L movie-
goer is to go see it with a friend,
or maybe alone, probably not
with your Fancy Dress date
(waterproof mascara is a
must), possibly with your
favorite liberal arts professor,
who could enlighten you on the
existential highlights of the film

much better than I, or maybe |

with your cook at the fraternity.
It doesn’t matter; just don’t
miss it because Lexington (or
Cannes for that matter) rarely
has it so good.

 

 

Litho display

The works of six modern
American artists are being ex-
hibited in duPont Gallery
through March 14. The show
consists of 21 lithographs and
screen prints from the print-

is an innovative graphic design
company striving to combine

in duPont

the creativity of fine American
artists with the technology of
State-of-the-art printing tech-

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

Last week I opened up a
review of Lexington fast food
fried chicken with our branch of
the world famous Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise, and
now it’s time to check out the
competition, something few of
you probably do. I logically will
move on to Kenneys, as it is the
most similar to KFC (with
respect to format — both offer
the traditional snack pack, with
coleslaw, roll, plastic utensils
and folded piece of pre-wetted
face wipe).

Eat Beat

Because Kenneys is not often
discussed or even attended by
very many Washington and Lee
students, and because it’s not
easily seen from any well-
traveled road, directions are
necessary. Assuming you know
where the Greyhound bus sta-
tion is, keep going up the hill
next to it, and you can’t miss
Kenneys, which sits alone,
triumphantly on the very top of
the hill. Whereas KFC serves
only chicken, as they brag, Ken-
neys is basically a burger joint
which also serves chicken. Of
all the fried chicken in Lex-
ington, Kenneys’ is the least
visually attractive; it doesn’t
look repelling, but it doesn’t
look mouth-watering either.
The pieces are small, not much
bigger than KFC pieces, and
greasy. When I checked back on
the notes I made a week ago
when I ate it, I noticed more
grease spots on my Kenneys
notes than on any other, and I
remembered why. But, it tastes

all right and stays open later
than any of the other places.
One major drawback with Ken-
neys is that you can only buy it
in their pre-packaged combina-
tions — you can’t get, say, an
all-white snack or a breast by
itself. Only wings are sold in-
dividually.

Yet with one respect, Ken-
neys whips KFC: instead of giv-
ing you one of those weightless,
tasteless, nondescript rolls that
ends up in the trash can, they
give you a deepfried biscuit and
a packet of honey. It’s the best
thing in the box.

The final two fried chicken
outlets in Lexington are the two
supermarket delis, at Kroger
and Safeway. Choosing between
Kroger’s chicken and KFC can
be difficult, and depending on
what you look for in fried
chicken, Kroger might suit you

better. Texturally, it’s crunch-
ier than KFC regular, and it has
a lot of taste as well. But after a
couple of pieces, it begins to
taste a bit rich, because an
unusually large portion of what
there is to eat from a piece of
Kroger chicken is the fried out-
side. Kroger’s pieces look big-
ger than they are, because the
fried outside layer (the skin? ) is
very thick. Often a big piece
will jut out and all it will be is
more fried outside layer, and
not meat. This suits me just fine

until about the third piece, when
it starts to taste very rich, and
what I really want is more
white meat. But if you just want
a piece or two, Kroger is good.
And here’s a tip: Kroger’s deli
closes at about 6:30 each night,
and they put together packets of

you need to get there on time,
because too many people
already know this.

But the Safeway crunchy is a
different story, and as of Tues-
day, they were still serving it.
The pieces are the biggest in
town, and, though not real
crunchy, it tastes good. I
recommend that you buy it hot,
as they offer it cold as well.
Though I’m usually a fan of cold
fried chicken, Safeway puts it in
a plastic container with not-so-
tasty potato salad and a piece of
dessert on a bed of lettuce; this
seems to take away from the
flavor and the moisture. But the
hot, non-breaded chicken at
Safeway provides an adequate,
if not memorable, fried chicken
eating experience.

Safeway, like KFC, offers two
types of chicken, one breaded,
the other somewhat crunchy.
The lady there told me they
were experimenting, and were
moving towards having only the
breaded. That would be a
mistake, as their breaded fried
chicken was the worst piece in
my sample, primarily because
it was dry and I don’t go for
breaded fried chicken. With
breaded chicken the fried outer
layer doesn’t so much stick to
the chicken as it contains it. It’s
like having chicken-in-a-pita
—the chicken is unwrapped
rather than picked at, and you'll
never have to lick your fingers.
If you prefer breaded chicken,
then I recommend you get a TV
dinner, and you'll get some
complimentary. mashed _pota-
toes and glow-in-the-dark peas
and carrots mix to go with it.

In this review of Lexington’s
take-out fried chicken, I have
been short on high praise, due
probably to the fact that I’ve
been spoiled on some great
fried chicken. So here’s what an
ideal piece of chicken is: As the
breast is my favorite piece, it’s
a breast. It is very big, about
the size of 3 KFC breasts, and it
holds within many strips of
moist, sweet white meat (a cer-
tain sweetness is a must in truly
delicious chicken, and I never
once experienced this sweet-
ness in Lexington chicken).
This piece does not need salt, as
the batter is plenty spicy on its
own, in a very subtle way. The
fried outer layer is crunchy and
flaky, and finds its way into
each crack and crevice in this
huge piece of chicken, and once
you’ve finished it, your cat
won’t even be interested.

Next week, The Ring-tum Phi
gets a large bill for a Fancy
Dress dinner for two at the

IU head questions EC rep

To the Editors:

I confess that I don’t always
read the Phi carefully, and
quite often I take it for granted.
However, after reading the Phi
of Feb. 23, I trust that I will no
longer take it for granted, nor
will I skim read it.

In Bruce Potter’s regular sec-
tion covering the Executive
Committee meetings, I found
out that the EC did not learn
from its tie blunder. At the close
of its meeting on Feb. 20, it once
again abused its power. Quite
frequently, the EC will appoint
ad-hoc members to various stu-
dent groups to ensure that they
are properly using the money
the EC has allocated to them.

Therefore, you can imagine
my surprise when I read in Mr.
Potter’s article that the EC had
appointed Andrew Caruthers
ad-hoc member to the Indepen-
dent Union, This from a group
who said “you’re not going to

KV

get a dime’”’ and “‘you would be
better off calling yourselves the
‘Camel Watcher’s Club’.”’
Several members of the EC
were sarcastic and rude when
we requested money, and its
leader and president was

_ quoted in the Phi as saying that

the IU would not be around
long. So why then did he appoint
Mr. Caruthers, who was one of
the loudest critics of the IU at
the meeting? After all, since we
got no money and the EC does
not believe we will be around
long, they have no right to ap-
point an ad-hoc member to the
IU.

While we welcome the chance
to work with Mr. Caruthers and
the EC, I must question their
motives. From Mr. Potter’s ar-
ticle, I gathered that Mr.
Caruthers was concerned that
the IU was not working with the
SAB. Well sir, we have spoken
with the SAB, and they have

helped us to put a band in the
Cockpit on Saturday night of
Fancy Dress weekend. Further,
the reason we have not done
more is because Andy Cooney
(SAB Chairman) and other SAB
leaders have expressed a desire
to wait until after Fancy Dress.
If Mr. Caruthers is genuinely

concerned that not enough is be-
ing done, why doesn’t he urge
the EC Committee on Inde-
pendents to do something?
After all, they have done less
than both the IU and the SAB.
Hmm, perhaps I will appoint an
ad-hoc member to the EC to en-
sure that they do their job. Any
volunteers?

Mr. Caruthers, I look forward
to working with you and the EC
as a whole, however, it is
because I am trying to open and
strengthen lines of communica-
tion, and not because I readily
accept the Executive Commit-
tee’s continued abuse of its
power.

 

 

Ties retlect respect

To the Editors:

In a time fraught with war
and pestilence, it should matter
little to the world whether
students at Washington and Lee
wear neckties, or shoes, or
whatever their dress might be.
This, we are told, is the age to
be casual, to do one’s own thing,
the era of the free spirit.

But I was saddened when I
read that student leaders at
W&L had succumbed to populist
pressure and rescinded their
recommendation to require ties
in the classroom.

A necktie, of course, carries
no special significance, but
wearing one is a part of being
well dressed, It seems an ap-
propriate gesture of respect to

Washington and Lee, great men
who gave character and name
to the university at Lexington.
Last fall, as a tourist I walked
the campus where their spirits
seem still to live. There was
nothing casual or common
about these men, no flexible
standards on right and wrong.
They towered above their peers
as leaders, strong and un-
yielding.

On the campus I felt an
awareness of their presence. As
indicated, the matter seems
trivial, but were I a student, I
would want my attire to be ap-
propriate for such company.

The purpose of this letter is to
inform all W&L lacrosse fans
that the athletic department’s
contract with the City of Buena
Vista prohibits the drinking of
alcoholic beverages in public
and should any such drinking
take place, the contract will be
terminated,

In reference to last Satur-
day’s scrimmage against North
Carolina, the Glen Maury Park
Supervisors were more than
pleased with the fans coopera-
tion in putting beverages in
cups, but the City Police were
not and wanted to enforce the
city ordinance of ‘‘No public
consumption of alcoholic
beverages” whether brown-
bagged or not. It is unclear at
this time whether or not tickets
will be issued in the future
should the police become aware
of the presence of alcoholic
beverages.

The W&L lacrosse program is
fortunate to Mave the use of the
“all weather”’ field and I ask for
your cooperation in adhering to
the Buena Vista City Codes so
that Glen Maury Park can con-
tinue to be an an asset for the
Generals.

Thank you and I look forward
to your support this spring.

but not be intimidated by the
process,” he said. ‘‘It’s easy to
be cowed by the unknown.”

“You don’t have to answer
self-incriminatory questions,
and there’s no reason you
should. Let them get that as the
fruits of law enforcement ef-
forts, not out of your mouth,” he
continued. .

Geimer also said that wit-
nesses should not feel compel-
led to answer ‘‘off-the-wall
questions.’’

“If a question seems im-
proper, refuse to answer.
Usually the prosecutor will go
on to something else, and just
let it go,” he said.

If the prosecutor doesn’t ‘‘let
it go,” the law professor ex-
plained, he can cite you with
contempt. Then a judge will
rule as to whether you were

 

justified in refusing to answer.

Should he find you were not
justified in withholding the in-
formation, you’re usually given
the opportunity to comply,
Geimer said.

Because of that procedure,
the dispute must concern a
question the prosecutor is will-
ing to defend in open court.

‘People ought to understand
that if they act in good faith, the
world isn’t going to come to an
end because they refuse to
answer a question they think is
improper,’ Geimer said.

According to Geimer, such
questions might include ones
which are irrelevant to the
stated purpose of the investiga-
tion, and questions which are
exceptionally broad and
therefore are not within the

could be useful to the pro-
secutor.

He said that some questions
which are being asked ‘‘have no
conceivable, legitimate ex-

_ planation that could make them

relevant.”

The Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution protects citizens
from being forced to testify
against themselves. (The 14th
Amendment makes that ap-
plicable to the states, as well as
to thefederal government. )

That right is not uncondi-
tional, however. On May. 22,
1972, in Kastigar v. United
States, the Supreme Court said
that the court ‘‘can compel
testimony from an unwilling
witness who invokes the Fifth
Amendment privilege against
compulsory  self-incrimination
by conferring immunity....”’

There are two principal types
of immunity, and someone testi-
fying for a body such as the
special grand jury should
understand the difference.

The narrower type is ‘‘use
and derivative use,’’ ‘“‘use and
fruits,” or simply ‘“‘use’’ im-
munity. The Supreme Court has

ruled that this is the only type of
immunity which must be
granted to force testimony.

It allows the person who was
granted immunity to later be
prosecuted, as long as the
evidence was obtained prior to
the time that he testified. What
he said or what could be derived
from it could not be used
against him.

The broader, more desirable
type of immunity, is ‘‘transac-
tional immunity.” This protects
a witness from action against
him for all crimes to which his
testimony relates.

This unequivocal immunity is
usually offered by a prosecutor
who wants to gain maximum
cooperation from a particular
witness.

A section of the Code of

Virginia dealing with drug mat-
ters grants automatic testi-
monial immunity to a witness
testifying about “‘any offense
alleged to have been committed
by another.”’

If in providing such informa-
tion, someone offers testimony
or evidence ‘‘tending to in-
criminate himself,’’ such
evidence ‘‘shall in no case be us-
ed against him nor shall he be
prosecuted for the offense as to
which he testifies.’

This Code section is the sub-
ject of heated debate among
local lawyers, because ap-
parently no judge has ever rul-
ed as to whether it applies to
special grand juries.

It appears to be applicable,
because it is pertinent to
regular grand juries, and
special grand juries are dealt
with in the same chapter of the
Code that regular grand juries
are.

“I can’t imagine any reason
for the legislators intending to
differentiate between types of
grand juries,’’ Geimer said.

Professor Roger D. Groot, a
W&L law professor who is de-
scribed by one of his colleagues
as ‘‘an expert in Virginia
criminal law,” said, “It says it
covers people testifying before
‘the’ grand jury. I’d be more
comfortable with it if it said ‘a’
grand jury.”

Also, the statute refers to an
“offense alleged to have been
committed by another,” and in
an investigative situation such
as this, a specific charge may
not be in mind when someone is
brought in for questioning.

The Code requires that the
foreman tell each special grand
jury witness that “‘he need not

answer any question or produce

any evidence that would tend to

incriminate him.” That is, of

course, until such time as im-

munity is granted. .

If the drug section applies,
refusing to testify or provide
materials is a Class 2 misde-
meanor, which is punishable by
up to six months in jail, a fine
not greater than $500, or both.

Even the lawyers are confus-
ed and uncertain about all of
this. The advice nearly all of
them giye is to get a specific
grant of immunity, and not rely
on whatever statutory protec-
tion you may or may not have.

“To be on the safe side, get
specific immunity,’’ Groot said.
“You may have it in the ab-
stract, but get it for this par-
ticular case. Then everything
will be clear if any claim is ever
raised.”’

“Get the Commonwealth on
the record,’’ Geimer said. ‘‘If
you have any doubts, say, ‘I
refuse to answer on the grounds
that I might incriminate
myself.’”’

One local lawyer who has ac-’
companied clients into the
special grand jury proceedings
said, ‘Don’t take any chances, I
tell my clients to get all the im-
munity they can get.”

He said that people who
testify are not being advised of
their specific rights and
vulnerabilities.

He also said that when the
special grand jury was just
starting, “the Commonwealth’s
Attorney was routinely grant-
ing immunity on specific ques-
tions.

“If you ask for it, now he is
more likely to grant blanket im-
munity.”

Track wins first ODAC title

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
track and field team won its
first Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference indoor track and field
championship Friday at VMI.

The Generals won the meet
despite the fact that they won
only one event, the 3,200-meter
relay. Sophomores Ron Moody
and Conrad Boyle teamed with
junior Mark Pembroke and
senior Paul Chapman to run the
distance in 8:15.

W&L outscored second-place
Lynchburg by five points, 98-93,
on the strength of five second-
place finishes and four third-
place results. Second-place fin-
ishers were Pembroke in the 800
meters, freshman John Carder
in the pole vault, sophomore
Billy Rhinehart in the triple
jump, the 400-meter relay team
and the 1600-meter team.

W&L track coach Norris
Aldridge, who was selected as
the ODAC Coach of the Year,
stressed that it was a team ef-
fort that led to the Generals’
success.

“It was a real team victory,”
said Aldridge.’ ‘‘Our depth and
our attitude were the reasons
that we won. We had people in
every event and most of them
were charged up for the meet. A
lot of our people had personal
best results.”’

Tri-captains for the 1984 team
are seniors Angus McBryde and

Charlie Alcorn and junior Chris
Ives. McBryde, who holds three
school records, became W&L’s
first cross country All-
American in the fall when he
finished 10th in the NCAA
Championships. Alcorn took se-
cond place in the shot put at
both the indoor and outdoor
ODAC championships last year.
Ives doubles as a sprinter and a
hurdler and should be a factor
in both events this year.

The Generals’ next meet, the
teams’s first encounter of the
outdoor season, will be against
Davidson at Davidson, N.C., on
March 17. Aldridge feels that
his team’s recent victory could
lead to a successful outdoor
season.

“This was a good starting
point for us,’’ Aldridge said,
“but if we’re to do well out-
doors, we must continue to work
hard andimprove.”

Dead team takes title

By MICHAEL MCALLISTER
Special to the Phi

The indoor soccer league
season and playoffs are finished
and a team named The Dead
captured the championship.

‘“‘What?”’ asks the avid indoor
soccer fan. ‘‘The league is in the
middle of the season and
anyway The Dead is a rock
group, nota soccer team.”’

While the fan is of course talk-
ing about the professional Ma-
jor Indoor Soccer League, the
league in question is Washing-
ton and Lee’s.

Although W&L’s indoor soc-
cer league does not receive a lot
of publicity, it has been in ex-
istence for seven seasons at
W&L with a high level of par-
ticipation. This season saw
around 80 players take part in
the action.

Piranian runs the league and
feels that it is worthwhile for
those who participate. The
league is open to anyone in-
terested who has some soccer
experience.

“Before we started to require
some soccer experience, the
play used to get out of hand, but
you do not need to be on the var-
sity team in order to play,” said
Piranian. He added that the
championship team had only
three varsity players out of ten
members.

This year’s season began in
November and ended Monday
night in Doremus Gymnasium,
when The Dead, led by captain
Randall Ray, won the cham-
pionship of the six-team league.

“My team was tired after
playing two preliminary games
that night, but in the finals we
revived to beat a team which
played only one game before
the finals,” said Ray.

Both Ray and Piranian agree
that everyone had a lot of fun in
the league this year and en-
courage all those who enjoy
competitive soccer to give it a
try next year.

Swimmers take 3rd

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
swimming team won _ third
place at the Virginia Senior
Championships last weekend at
Virginia Tech. The Briarwood
Aquatic Club of Richmond, Va.,
was the meet champion.

The Generals swam very well
last weekend, according to
assistant coach Bob Newcomb.
The team turned in ‘‘a lot of
lifetime bests and some really
super swims,” Newcomb said.

Generals Martin Radvany
and Taber Smith contributed
outstanding performances last
weekend. Radvany’s 100-yard
breaststroke time helped
qualify W&L’s 400 medley relay
team, which can be composed
aggregately, for the NCAA Na-
tional Championships.

 

Smith qualified for the cham-

pionship heat in last weekend’s
meet in both the 50 and 100
freestyle. He swam a personal
best time in each event.

Baseball talent returns

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

With six of eight starters and
the top three pitchers from last
year returning, head baseball
coach Jim Murdock believes
that this year could be a turning
point for Generals baseball.

“‘We have the talent and the
attitude to be competitive this
year,” he said. ‘We are deep in
a number of positions, including
pitching, and we should be very
strong defensively. We also
have some talented hitters
throughout the lineup.” _

The top three returning pitch-
ers are junior Bill White,
sophomore Kirk Breen and
sophomore Peter Detlefs. Mur-
dock also sees three freshman
pitchers as contributing: Randy

Brown, Jon Thornton and Bill
Schoettelkotte.

Murdock said there is an in-
tangible aspect to the Gener-
als. “‘We have developed
a great attitude this year.
Everyone has been working
hard and everyone is primed
and ready to contribute.”’

Murdock sees_ perennial
ODAC power Lynchburg as
tough again this year.

“I think we’re as good as they
are,”’ he added. ‘‘We have to
make our own breaks this
year.”

The first baseball game of the
season is a doubleheader at
Christopher Newport Sunday
March 4. The home opener is
against VMI on Thursday,

Daly will rely on defense

By JOHN HARRISON
Staff Reporter

Coming off five preseason
scrimmages, where the Gener-
als ‘‘ran the gamut,’’ according
to head lacrosse coach Dennis
Daly, the 1984 edition of W&L
lacrosse gets under way Sunday
afternoon with a Fancy Dress
weekend tilt at Wilson Field
against interstate foe Virginia
Tech. Game time is 2 p.m.

Daly, who came to W&L after
Jack Emmer resigned in June
to take a similar position at Ar-
my, will rely on an aggressive
defense to start a fast-paced
transition for the offense. This
contrasts to Emmer’s teams,
which preferred to attack the
goal from settled situations.

“‘We’ve got to be aggressive,”
Daly said of the defense, which
will be led by senior team cap-
tain Tim Schurr and sophomore
Chris John. ‘‘We’re best when
the ball is on the ground, so we
have to be more conscious of
taking the ball away. It will set
the mood for the rest of the
team,” he added.

Along with Schurr and John,
the other starters on defense

will be senior Roland Simon and

junior Marshall Bowden. Sopho-
more Pete Braden, who played
junior varsity last year, and
freshman Bob Berlin are ex-
pected to round out the defense.

In goal, which was expected
to be a position with three
strong stoppers, the situation
has changed. John DiDuro, who
was to be the starter, was in-
jured in practice. The exact
length of his absence was not
determined. Senior Phil Aiken,
who played the first half of
Saturday’s scrimage in
Buena Vista against North
Carolina, will start while
DiDuro is out. Freshman John
Church, who finished against
UNC, will be the backup.

“I feel the most crucial posi-
tion is the goalie, and our
goaltenders are more than
capable of playing that role,”’
Daly said.

“We're looking for everyone
to carry the load,” Daly said,
“not just a couple of people.”

Junior Jeff Mason (11 goals
last season), senior Lee
Heimert (9 goals), and junior
Mark Knobloch (7 goals) are
the top returners. Daly expects
Mason and sophomore Caulley

Deringer, who along with
Junior Rod Santomassimo had
two goals against North
Carolina, to work around the
crease. Heimert and sophomore
Bill Holmes are expected to pro-
vide the hard attacks to the
goal, while Santomassimo and
sophomore Todd Breithaupt
will use the dodge to attack.

Among midfielders, junior
Rich Schoenberg will take the
majority of face-offs. Juniors
Dave Johnston, Sandy Brown
and Barry Waterman will han-
die the rest. Seniors Kevin
Walakovits and three freshmen,
Jeff Sindler, Joe Krastel and
Tim Finnerty, and _ three
sophomores up from junior var-
sity Mike McAlaine, Steve
McGrath and Scott Keith com-
plete the group that will run the
transition game.

“T get the feeling that there
was a negative feeling about
lacrosse here the last couple of
years,” Daly said. “But every-
one has worked hard in getting
to learn each other's style, and
at this point there is a lot of en-
thusiasm. We will have fun
playing and our fans will enjoy
watching us play,”’ he said.

It IS unfair to
be an athlete

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....Y know in all this flippant
commentary stuff about these
sturdy young beings who run,
jump and play for the pleasure
of the masses — I’m talking
about the athlete, for those who
are still reading — it is so easy
to forget how derogatory the
label can be after you take
away the flashy uniforms, the
groupies, the endorsements and
the cute ‘‘Up Close and Per-
sonal’ segments. We’re at the
time of year where many
“‘athletes”’ are suiting up for the
last time, whether it be in high
school, college or some other
unknown outpost of athletic
competition. It all seems so un-
fair. The sacrifices, long hours,
setbacks and triumphs, headlin-
ed or hidden, all reduced to a
fina] lacing up of the sneakers
(skates) and riding the bench or
bowing out a champion. It
makes no difference. Tomorrow
or next week or next year,
they'll be the things that
everyone knows are missing but
no one can put their finger on.
The next time out no one will

Canfield reviews 83-84, looks to future

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field is looking to the future,
perhaps a bit sooner than he
would like.

While Roanoke College is
looking forward to the NCAA
tournament after taking its
fourth consecutive Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship this week with a 93-78
victory over Catholic Universi-
ty, Canfield spent the week
recruiting players for next
year.

“Recruiting is going excep-
tionally well,” said Canfield,
whose 20-year record at W&L
stands at 324-190. ‘‘We want to
get as good a (freshman) class
as we had this year, back to
back.’

“I think we’re going to see
and hear a lot from (this year’s
freshmen) in the future, and if
we get another class like that I

think we’ve got the nucleus we

want and we'll continue winn-
ing.”

The Generals finished their
14-12 season with a 65-60 over-
time loss to Lynchburg College
Tuesday, Feb. 21, in the first
round of the ODAC tournament.

It was the last college basket-

' ball game for co-captains Chris

Baldwin and John Lee Graves.
Graves, who ended his career at
W&L seventh on the all-time
scoring list with 1441 points, has
been nominated for All-
American status.

“We just got into the situation
where we either were playing
‘not to lose’ or we were over-
reacting to officials,’ he said.
“Our concentration was totally

broken and we did not play
within our own system as we
had been doing previously.”’

Canfield noted from the
beginning of the season that this
year’s schedule was the
toughest any of his W&L teams
had faced. For this reason he
believes the success of the
season can not be judged on the
record alone.

“There are so many factors
here that people are overlook-
ing,” he said. “I think this is the
kind of a season where you have
to look at the positive things.”

He pointed out that this was
the team’s 17th winning season
since he’s been here. He also
noted that in free throw percen-
tage, field goal percentage and
team defense the Generals were
ranked number one in the con-
ference, in the top three of all
small colleges in the state, and
in the top 20 in the nation at one
time or another during the
season.

“I think the guys also deserve
a lot of credit for the way they
regrouped after Lex left,’ said
Canfield, referring to junior for-
ward Lex Fitzenhagen, who

was lost for the season with a
knee injury after 13 games.

Canfield noted that when the
season ended Fitzenhagen still
had the second-best scoring
average on the team.

“In other words, we didn’t
have another double-figure
scorer besides John Lee. I think
it says something about the
guys that they could do that,”
he said.

care because there will be
another puzzle piece that will fit
the vacated spot. There may
even be a new puzzle. All this
philosophical wandering serves
a purpose, that being that we all
have been an athlete in some
far-fetched form or another,
and when the game is over for

Tie out...

the last time, there is no greater
injustice known to this common
man. It is an emptiness, a
“something missing’’ that can’t
be explained, only felt. It’s been
postulated that high drug usage
among athletes is a response to
the void left after the game ex-
perience. I think we can see how
this void can exist. In the end, it
IS unfair to be an athlete,
because the only reward for be-
ing one is an incessant sense of
unfulfillment....

about throwing something out

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team will attempt to capture
its sixth ODAC title in eight
tries in the 1984 season, which
begins Friday at 3:00 with a
home match against Penn-
sylvania State University.

The varsity tennis team
features four returnees among
the top six singles players.
Craig Cannon (captain), Andy
Haring (who will be traveling
abroad during the spring term
and thus will miss the latter half
of the season), Scott Adams and
Jim Irwin return from the top
six of last year’s ODAC cham-
pionship team.

Charlie Kalocsay and Jim
Culnane also are returning
from last year’s squad, while
sophomore John Meloy and
freshmen Roby Mize and Randy
Johns are new additions to the

 

Netters open with
Div, I Penn State

varsity program.

Cannon and Mize, playing at
number one and two singles and
number one doubles, portend
good things for 1984 for the
Generals. The Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
preseason Division III rankings
have Mize ranked 35th, Cannon
2ist and the Cannon/Mize
doubles pair 12th in the country.

“‘Depthwise we are stronger
than we were last year,” head
coach Gary Franke said.

Franke believes that this
year’s team has the potential to
improve last year’s dual match
record of 7-14 and also acquire a
bid to the NCAA Division III
tournament.

Following the Penn State
match on Friday, the Generals
will play Slippery Rock on
Saturday at noon and face
Rochester, ranked eighth at the
end of last season, Monday at
3:00. Both of these are home
matches.

Vice President

(continued from page 1)
sophomore and senior, said he
would favor a ‘‘White Book’’
revision that would eliminate
the statement, ‘“‘The (honor)
system applies to any conduct
considered dishonorable by the
student generation involved.”

‘Drugs should be handled in
the courts,’”’ he continued. ‘‘To
Start regulating students’ lives
beyond the boundaries of those
three areas could prove danger-
Ous,”’

“I’m worried about the honor
system,” Baumgaertner said.
Although “‘we can’t codify the
honor system,”’ he said, ‘‘we
need to redefine what con-
stitutes an honor offense.”

Jonson, who served as a
sophomore EC representative,
also said that drug matters
should be prosecuted by outside
courts, instead of ‘‘the school
doing a police number.”

“If the present generation
thinks it’s an honor violation,
then it’ll show up in the honor
trials,’’ he said.

White said that one can’t
make general statements about
honor matters, but instead has
to look at specific cases.

“T have a lot of unfinished
business with the honor sys-

 
 
   
 
  
  
    

THE

tem,” he said. ‘‘I think it needs
strengthening. I think it’s
weakening.”’

A frequent theme during the
two-hour forum was that this
year’s EC had not been suffi-
ciently responsive to student
opinion.

‘What bothered me this year
was that I don’t think this year’s
Committee has represented stu-
dents as best they could,’’ White
said. ‘‘We are a representative
body. I think the students need
to have their views expressed a
little better.”’

According to White, the next
EC ‘‘needs to represent
students a lot more effectively.
That should be our main con-
cern.

“I feel I can do that because I
know a lot of students and have
a far-reaching knowledge of a
wide variety of students,’ he
said.

The responsiveness issue
focused on the EC’s proposal
that faculty members require
that ties be worn in their
classes.

“I like wearing ties,’’ said
Baumgaertner, the only one of
the three with an open collar.
‘‘But I don’t think it’s some-
thing the EC should stick its
nose into.”’

Jonson said the tie matter had
‘been blown out of proportion
by the media,” but that he

didn’t think the EC had a good
feeling for how the students
felt.”’

White said the tie proposal
started out as ‘‘a_ friendly
recommendation’ and “‘some-
thing that used positive motiva-
tion’ before it became ‘‘a big
issue.”

All of them said they favorea
retaining the finance subcom-
mittee initiated this year to
review organizations’ budget
requests before making a
recommendation to the entire
EC.

Baumgaertner said funding
requests should be considered
in light of an organization’s
size. ‘If there is great student
interest, I think it should have
funds,” he said.

Jonson said he would ex-
amine the size and impact of an
organization when determining
its student tax allocation. He
said he thinks funding should be
reduced for organizations
“which represent a single in-
terest’’ instead. of being
available to all students.

White said he had worked
closely with Vice president
Dave Judge during this year’s
budget hearings. ‘“‘This was an
especially tough and tight year,
and the subcommittee saved a
lot of time,” he said. ‘‘It was in-
valuable during the rocky road
of the budget process.”’
