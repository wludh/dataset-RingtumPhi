Felon to get degree

Application to be reviewed in May

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

A Washington and Lee stu-
dent who has been convicted of
a felony will be eligible for a
W&L undergraduate degree in
May, the Student Affairs Com-
mittee ruled Monday.

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee (SAC) voted unanimously to
accept a recommendation from
the Student Control Committee
to suspend for one year the
diploma of William Dederick
who was convicted of selling co-
caine, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute and
possession of marijuana seeds.

According to Dean of
Students Lewis John, the stu-
dent’s application for a degree
will be reviewed by the faculty
in May at the same time that all
other degree applications for
1984 .commencement are
reviewed.

The decision made Monday
by the SAC closed the question
of Dederick’s diploma which
was opened after his arrest last
spring.

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment arrested and charged
Dederick in May, only a few
days before he was to be
graduated. The faculty met that
week and voted to have the ap-
propriate student disciplinary
committee study the case
before making a decision on the
degree, Dean John said.

Because the case did not in-
volve honor by _ university
definition, it first came to the
Student Control Committee
(SCC), which is made up of
undergraduate class presidents
and vice-presidents and law
school class presidents.

After SCC Chairman Charlie
Alcorn had _ independently
studied the facts of the case, the
SCC voted unanimously Oct. 4
to recommend the one-year
suspension, Dean John said.

The SAC then voted
unanimously to accept the SCC
recommendation.

Dean John explained that an

earlier study of the case was
postponed until the student’s
trial. He said that parts of the

court record were used by the
SCC to clarify the facts.

Alcorn said he told the other
members of the SCC to ‘‘feel
out’’ the opinions of their consti-
tuents on the issue to help them
make their judgment. He said
that because the vote for
suspension was unanimous, he
felt the board was confident of
its decision. (A vote must pass
the SCC with no more than two
dissensions. )

‘“‘We were between a rock and
a hard place in Bill Dederick’s
case because he had finished his
academic _requirements,”’
Alcorn said.

Chief discusses ABC laws with frats

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence O. Sutton will be
meeting with the Interfraterni-
ty Council tonight to ‘‘discuss
various problems that are real
or perceived on both sides.”’

The main agenda item will be
the Virginia law, effective last
July 1, which forbids those
under the age of 19 from con-
suming alcohol, including beer.

Representatives of the state
Alcoholic Beverage Control
Board will attend and explain
their policies to representatives
of the fraternities.

Sutton is uncertain what tack
the ABC Board will take in en-
forcing the regulations.

‘“‘We agree that we can’t ar-
rest every 18-year-old who

Alcorn explained that since
Dederick had completed his

degree requirements, his case
was a different situation from a

student who was still working
on his degree.

‘‘We want to make it clear to
the student body that any stu-
dent that comes before a stu-
dent disciplinary board on a
drug charge is going to face
significant repercussions,”’
Alcorn said.

Next week the SCC will
review the case of Thomas J.
Rorhig, a Washington and Lee
senior who was convicted of
selling marijuana and posses-
sion of marijuana seeds with in-
tent to distribute.

The SCC will make a recom-
mendation to the SAC on
whether or not Rorhig will be
allowed to continue as a student
at W&L, Dean John said.

drinks beer,” he said. ‘‘Beyond
that, I don’t know what the
guidelines will be.”’

He emphasized, however:

“The question is not whether or
not the law is going to be enforc-
ed — merely how.”’
‘ Sutton said that to his
knowledge, there was never an
ABC agent in Lexington <-~ing
Rush. ‘‘If there’d been one, I
think you’d know about it,’”’ he
said.

This may have led to less cau-
tion by the fraternities as Rush
progressed. “I think it is
natural that people have to be
reminded to be careful of ac-
tivities that may get them in
trouble,’’ Sutton said.

“The longer you do something
without creating a problem for
yourself, the more careless you
become.”’

He declined to speculate how

much manpower the Salem of-
fice of the ABC Board will con-
centrate around campus after
the Oct. 13 meeting.

The chief said that his depart-
ment will be providing alcohol
enforcement authorities
‘‘whatever assistance is need-
ed. We will be working closely
together. It will be a mutual ef-
fort.”

In his talks with fraternity
presidents and IFC officials,
Sutton said, ‘‘We made it quite
clear that we do intend to en-
force the law, but we plan to do
it in a manner that will foster
voluntary cooperation, not with
a hard-nosed approach that
would lead to confrontation.

“‘T also promised them that I
would contact the members of
the state ABC Board and I
would seek the same spirit from
them.”’

  

“I’m not going around sniff-
ing every paper cup that I
might see an apparent 18-year-
old holding in his hand,’’ the
chief said. ‘I prefer to look at it
from the standpoint of control.
Control is the key to the pro-
blem.”’

“If a subject appears to be af-
fected by alcohol and/or
drugs,”’ he explained, ‘‘the per-
son is approached and if the

odor of alcohol is detected, they
would be required to produce
I.D. establishing their age.”’

“T will arrest any 18-year-old
I see obviously consuming an
alcoholic beverage in public,”’
Sutton said.

“If that 18-year-old is ob-
viously drunk or is creating a
problem, then I will investigate
to see if that was the result of

On Honor’s edge

The shower of drug-related arrests and investiga-
tions that began last srping and has carried over to
this fall has posed W&L with many new decisions.
While such eases are terribly usual and unpreceden-
tal in the world of prosecution, the W&L community
must now decide where it puts such cases in relation
to honor.

We W&L students have grown to feel confident of
leaving books, watches, clothes, etc. anywhere on the
Hill. We derive that confidence from the knowledge
that individuals who are not trustworthy and
honorable can be effectively purged from the W&L
community.

While we do not bicker with the recent decision
made by the Student Affairs Committee and the Stu-
dent Control Committee, we see the need to shine a
bright light on it and other similar situations. Because
Mr. Dederick was arrested and charged at the last
minute, the University and its disciplinary boards
were put in a very tricky and touchy position. Had the
arrest been made as little as two weeks earlier, their
decision might well have been different.

But the decision does raise the question of a prece-
dent. Although the circumstances of the felony did not
qualify for an honor hearing, the question of honor un-
mistakeably must enter the decision.

Here in a university community where a student
may be expelled for looking over a shoulder or for
stealing a $20 Cross pen, we question whether there is
a place for a student who has been convicted of deal-
ing hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars in nar-
cotics. More importantly, does that student deserve
the same W&L diploma earned by all the others who
have lived within the bounds of honor for four years?

We believe not.

“Should Washington and Lee

In his article of Oct. 6, Nelson
Patterson states, ‘It is not the
responsibility of the EC to pay
for students’ mistakes, care-
lessness, or follies...Rather,
funds are given organizations
with the expectation that they
be handled and spent judicious-
ly.”’ Apparently, in Mr. Patter-
son’s mind, the Mock Conven-
tion is a careless student
organization, recklessly throw-
ing money away on any and
everything. I assure you,
nothing could be further from
the truth.

Observations on coed

To the Editors:

After reading Mr. Hale’s ex-
hortation for student involve-
ment in the determination of the
coeducation issue, I felt com-
pelled to scribble down some
observations which have been
crossing my mind of late. Un-
doubtedly, the decision to either
remain a single-sex institution
or change to coeducation will
not be satisfactory to all
members of the W&L communi-
ty — past and present. Presi-
dent Wilson has many impor-
tant considerations to ponder
before he makes his recommen-
dation to the Board of Trustees
in February. He has stated that
he does not wish to ‘‘alienate’’
people — good luck. It is a
credit to his integrity as an
educator and a reflection of his
concern for the school’s welfare
that he even raises the coeduca-
tion issue. However, by doing
so, he risks creating an ex-

when this article is obviously
his editorial opinion). Ap-
parently Mr. Patterson is gifted
with ESP and can read minds,
although his ‘‘discoveries’’ are
far from being correct.

I can assure Mr. Patterson
that not only has the Finance
Committee raised one sixth of
its goal, but it is currently in the
process of sending out another
request for funds from most
prominent corporations.

In asserting $6,000 in bonds
will not be available until after
the Convention, Mr. Patterson
is again mistaken, as is general-
ly the case throughout his arti-
cle. The ‘misunderstanding’
about the bonds’ due date has
been resolved, to the effect that
the Mock Convention will take
in more than was originally an-
ticipated.

I certainly hope Mr. Patter-
son’s fears are allayed, and
before any more “crying, weep-
ing, and gnashing of teeth” on
his part, I suggest he
thoroughly look into whatever
he chooses to discuss.

tremely detrimental rift be-
tween the institution and its
alumni, faculty and students.
The school has existed for 234
years as a single-sex institution.
The idea of women attending
W&L is abhorrent to many.
President Wilson must decide
whether coeducation could
cause a change in support of the
school. He must consider not on-
ly possible alterations in finan-
cial contributions made by
alumni, and student fees but
also changes in the intangible
aspects of single-sex education
which are so inherently impor-
tant at W&L.

President Wilson and the
other committees which will
study the issue must be ex-
tremely diligent and thorough
in their undertaking. They must
determine beyond any
reasonable doubt, that the
school will benefit substantially
from coeducation if they are to
recommend change. Coeduca-
tion for the sake of having
women present is rot. If finan-
cial and academic admissions
consideration indicate absolute
necessity for a switch then the
change should be recommend-
ed. However, if the various
groups which study the issue

Review and Outlook Jenevein on coed issue

Trustees this year for a final
decision. It could be dismissed
as in the past. It could be im-
plemented by Fall, 1985. In any
case, the student voice will be
heard and considered before
that final decision is made.

As President of the Student
Body, I consider it my respon-
sibility to air that student voice,
whatever it may be. As at least
600 of you are aware, the Ex-
ecutive Committee conducted a
poll on Wednesday, Oct. 5, to
tap student sentiment on
coeducation. It was an informal
poll with a wide margin of er-
ror. Many people never even
knew it was being conducted.
And that was precisely our in-
tent. We wanted to know what
students thought before they
were bombarded with statis-
tics, peer pressure, lobbying,
professors’ opinions or anything
that could change their minds.
In my unprofessional opinion,
we got what we wanted.

The poll showed 75 percent of
the students voting against
coeducation. That’s a 3:1 ratio.
Of further interest, there were
as many votes against coeduca-
tion that included creative ex-
clamations unfit for print as
there were votes for coeduca-
tion. That seemed to indicate
that students against accepting
women were more adamant in
their feelings than students in
favor of the change.

But, again, I realize the
limitations of our poll, and I
don’t place undue validity in it.
We will conduct a subsequent
poll after students have had a
chance to better acquaint

least maintain the present
academic and financial posture
of the school, single-sex educa-
tion must continue.

Finally, throughout the infor-
mation gathering and decision
making procedure, President

Wilson should continually up-
date the W&L community on the
proceedings. As Mr. Hale urged
last week, the W&L student
body must get involved. Con-
tinual status reports would pro-
vide incentive for participation,
instigating further response to
various aspects of the issue
which will doubtlessly be rais-
ed.

Washington and Lee will cer-
tainly survive this year and the
issue of coeducation. Two hun-
dred, thirty-four years, and
several wars have not
destroyed it yet. It took dedica-
tion and involvement on the
part of many individuals to
facilitate W&L’s past success.
We must continue the tradition
of intense involvement in the in-
stitution, especially this year, if
it is to thrive in the future.

January 19, 1983, was not just
another day at Washington and
Lee University. That afternoon,
a huge crowd packed Evans
Dining Hall to witness the in-
troduction of W&L’s 2ist presi-
dent.

When Dr. John Wilson step-
ped up to the podium, Evans
Dining Hall exploded with a
roar of applause. A Rhodes
Scholar, successful teacher,
former Wells College president,
and a_ respected individual,
John Wilson was surely ‘‘our
man for the job.”

Nine months have passed,
and all but a few people are still
applauding. The new president
is making waves.

Rarely has an issue aroused
so much controversy and emo-
tion, bitterness and debate as
that of coeducation. The issue
has come up twice before, but
now Wilson wants to put it to
rest. What he’s gotten in unrest.

Controversy over coed could damage W&L

applicants and, at the same
time, maintain high academic
standards. Public and private
secondary schools nationwide
are, it seems, turning out fewer
graduates. A birth rate that has
dipped in the last 15-20 years
has a lot to do with the problem.

Figures indicate that in the
next decade alone the number
of graduating high school
seniors will drop 26 percent.

sports such as football and
lacrosse will be crushed and
fraternities ruined, because
there won’t be as many males to
choose from. Housing is another
concern, as is alumni reaction
to the move.

As the coed controversy takes
shape, it’s becoming readily ap-

an issue in Baltimore

By STEPHEN MATRAZZO

As a Baltimorean, I often find
it easy to exaggerate the na-
tional importance of events in
my home town. This time
around, however, the nation
does have something to gain by
learning from Baltimore.

As the black populations in
our major cities have increas-
ed, so has the political polariza-
tion of the races. Only months
ago, Chicagoans provided us
with a very ugly example of the
possible results of such
polarization. Many blacks
responded to the battle cry,
“It’s our turn!’ while vast
numbers of whites crossed
once-impenetrable party lines
simply to avoid having a black
mayor. The result of such
racially motivated behavior by
voters and candidates has been
an increase in overall racial
tension and impotent city
government. It doesn’t always
have to be that way.

The stage was set for this
year’s Baltimore municipal
elections by the election last fall
of Baltimore State’s Attorney
Kurt Schmoke. Schmoke, a 32-
year old black lawyer, combin-
ed black support with an unex-
pected number of white votes to
oust white incumbent William
Swisher. With Schmoke’s vic-
tory came the widespread

realization that candidates
could actually win cross-racial
support.

That simple yet revolutionary
concept came to fruition in the
Democratic primaries held last
month. (The Republicans are a
non-entity in Baltimore. Sorry,
guys.) Serious black contenders
emerged for each of the three
citywide offices, yet appeals to
race were muted if they existed
at all. Some of the white Demo-
cratic clubs, the traditional
power brokers in Baltimore
politics, went so far as to en-

My View

 

 

dorse blacks for ‘Comptroller
and City Council President, in-

cluding the lily-white Stonewall
organization, much maligned
by blacks and others as the last
bastion of all-white machine
politics in Baltimore, which en-
dorsed Clarence Burns, a black,
for Council president, rejecting
an old ally, the previously men-
tioned William Swisher, who
also sought the office.

At the same time black
Democratic clubs such as the
Eastside organization endorsed
the incumbent mayor, William
Donald Schaefer, over
challenger William Murphy,
scion of a locally prominent

black family, who had made a
great reputation as an attorney
and judge and would in any
other city command universal
balck support.

After a campaign
remarkably free of racial over-
tones, the majority-black
Baltimore electorate voted con-
vincingly for a City Council in
which whites outnumbered
blacks and which included two
white council members from a
district that is two-thirds black.
(Each district elects three
council members.) Burns was
elected council president with
the help of pluralities in the
white ethnic areas of south and
southeast Baltimore, while the
majority-black voters returned
incumbent Comptroller Hyman
Pressman to office over a
viable challenger, state
legislator John Douglass.

‘Lhe best sign of all, however,
had to be that Schaefer, faced
with a strong black challenge,
won not only an overall majori-
ty but a majority of the black
vote. That’s right; if absolutely
no whites had voted, Schaefer
would’ve won on the basis of
black votes alone.

All in all, both black and
white Baltimoreans performed
well in this rejection of overt
racial appeals. Harold
Washington and Eddie
Vrdolyak should take note and
learn.

So should a lot of other people.

believe this tradition will be
jeopardized by allowing women
to attend W&L. Those favoring
coeducation, on the other hand,
argue that the sheer necessity
of accepting women merely in
order to survive outweighs any
consideration of tradition.

Proponents of coeducation
have a valid concern. Never-
theless, weighed with argu-
ments opposing coeducation,
the scales become topped
against them.

Coeducation advocates have
concerned themselves with the
question of what happens if
W&L doesn’t go coed. Can it
continue to draw ‘‘quality”’
students? Can it continue to
compete with other top colleges
and universities? Can it keep
from shrinking in size?

For them, coeducation is a
solution, a way out of a problem
which every year gets bigger.

In their fear of what lies
ahead for W&L if it remains
single sex, supporters of
coeducation have seemingly
overlooked a very important

question. They may have
forgotten to ask whether
coeducation will improve the
university. Is their ‘‘yes” vote
in favor of accepting women a
vote prompted more out of
deseration and less out of a
belief that the university will
benefit from the move (i.e., that
it will help students better in-
teract and thus better prepare
them for the outside world)?
Have they concerned them-
selves too much with ‘What
happens if W&L doesn’t accept
women?” and failed to ask
‘What happens if W&L does?”’

The coeducation issue is too
important to be decided upon
without careful examination of
every facet surrounding it. At
risk is the identity of an institu-
tion which has stood for 235
years. Those for coeducation as
well as those against must look
at the issue in every light and
with a clear mind.

The new president is making
waves. Open discussion and opi-
nion must not be drowned amid
the turbulence.

 

Groups aid candidates

Buchanan on special interests

by NELSON PATTERSON
StaffReporter .

The charge that Walter Mon-
dale and other Democratic
presidential hopefuls are selling
out to special-interest groups is
a moot point, according to W&L
Politics Professor William
Buchanan. As he sees it, many
of the groups are being forced to
back candidates earlier and
earlier to maximize their
political clout because of the in-
creased role of the media in na-
tional elections.

‘What has changed in
politics is television. Television
has made it very expensive to
conduct primary campaigns,
and with the importance they
place on early primaries - the
Iowa caucus and the New
Hampshire primary- it forces
them to raise money quicker to
get greater exposure earlier.
Here is where unions are impor-
tant,” Buchanan said.

“Unions are organized,”
he said, ‘‘and can help to get
the grass-roots campaigning
‘done, the door-to-door stuff.
Really, the nomination may be
sewn up by what they’re doing
now more so than ever before,
due to television, the money
needed for television access,
and the impact of the union en-
dorsements.”

Buchanan counters those
critics of special — interest
politics by pointing out several
observations about the political
process. To those who say
teachers, because of their in-
volvement with the young,
should stay neutral in politics,
Buchanan asks where the line
should be drawn.

 

“Suppose it was the Na-
tional Council of Churches
backing some candidate? Could
that be supported? If you pick
out one particular group, not
legally prohibited from the
right to petition government,
you are really questioning the
appropriateness said.

In the case of the National
Education Association backing
Walter Mondale, Buchanan
noted that the teachers — and
the educational system as a
whole — have a great stake in
the policies of the federal
government.

“Teachers have a political in-
terest in this process. Look at
the federal subsidy to educa-

‘tion. The president has made

noises about the quality of
education and has called into
question their capabilities to
teach. To prohibit only those
groups with contact with young
people to become active in
politics is to deprive the group
of their consitutional right of
petition. The NEA endorsement
is one way of (practicing that
right)’’ said Buchanan.

“Take the unions. Do they
up and do this unless (the can-
didate) has some promise of do-
ing what they want? In endors-
ing this early, the question is
not ‘Should they back the can-
didate?’ but ‘Is it advantageous
todo this soearly?’

‘Does the fact that the union
(AFL-CIO) came out for Mon-
dale help him get the nomina-
tion? Of course it does. Thus it
is highly effective isn’t it?,” he
remarked.

Joyce: Prosecutor doesn’t have to be a hardnose

Candidate says he would avoid a ‘let’s get’em

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Robert N. Joyce, Jr. says that
if he wins his race for Com-
monwealth’s Attorney, he’ll
avoid a “‘let’s get ’em, let’s
hang ’em at all costs’ attitude
as the prosecutor for Lexington
and Rockbridge County.

On Nov. 8, Joyce, who’s runn-
ing as an independent, faces in-
cumbent Republican John
Read, Democrat Larry Mann
and independent James T.
Adams.

Joyce, who currently handles
a number of defense cases, says
that being a prosecutor ‘‘won’t
change my priorities...A pro-
secutor doesn’t have to be a
total hardnose. I think there’s
room for compassion.

“You don’t set out to put not-
ches in your gun. You try to get
a fair and honest result. Your
obligation is to present what
you perceive to be the truth, and
what you believe to be the
truth.”

 

“{ think I have a sense of
justice tempered with compas-
sion,’ Joyce said. ‘“‘I see people
in unfortunate circumstances,
and sometimes they get in
situations where I might do the
same thing under those cir-
cumstances.

“When you do something
wrong, that doesn’t cast you as
a criminal for the rest of your
life.”

However, Joyce said that
although he has ‘‘a sympathetic
note in (his) soul,” there are
“people who repeatedly exhibit

Joyce, 33, is a single resident
of Lexington. He is known to
friends by the nickname he’s
carried since childhood,
“‘Bucky.”’

He was born here, and

graduated from Lexington High

 

«
ROBERT N. JOYCE, JR
School before attending the

University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
Joyce graduated from

Washington and Lee’s Law
School before becoming an
associate of attorney Eric Lee
Sisler, the position he’s held for
the last two years.

Sisler, the treasurer for
Joyce’s campaign, was the
Commonwealth’s Attorney for
this area before being defeated
by Read in November 1975.

Some observers have sug-
gested that memories of 1975
caused Sisler to encourage a
run by Joyce.

“I certainly don’t think so,”
Joyce said. “Eric is basically
apolitical now. I don’t think he’s
vengeful or would hold that kind
of a grudge.”’

Some believe that the two in-
dependents in the race will
serve as “‘spoilers,”’ dividing
the opposition to the incumbent.

“‘We probably will to some ex-
tent,” Joyce acknowledged.
“But I don’t think any vote-
splitting we do will insure
John’s re-election.

“Tt won’t automatically
benefit John. I feel like I have a
good chance of being elected
despite the fact that there are
four people in the race.”

Joyce, who announced in
May, says he chose to run as an
independent because ‘‘it was
my best chance to be in the final
race.”

“I don’t feel I had a good
chance for getting the nomina-
tion of either party because of
the other people’s political con-
nections,” Joyce said.

“I had no allegiance to one
party or the other, and I have
never been politically con-
nected with either one.”

Also, Joyce said he didn’t
want to be obligated to support
a party’s whole slate of can-
didates because of its endorse-
ment.

He said that with his indepen-
dent label, he hopes to ‘‘appeal
to people all across the

socioeconomic spectrum.”
Because he wants to increase

his recognition factor, Joyce
has been running a ‘‘do-it-
yourself”’ campaign.

“Every single poster of mine
you see in a window, I put there
myself, and introduced myself
to the proprietor,”’ Joyce said.

He says he’s visited all major
employers and nearly every
business in the county in the last
few months. Joyce says he
hasn’t yet gone door-to-door at
residences, but he’ll start that
process soon.

The candidate says he has “‘a
good rapport’’ with the citizens
of the Rockbridge area.

“‘T grew up here, and my roots
are here. I think I know the peo-
ple in the community,’ he said.

Joyce says it’s essential that
the Commonwealth’s Attorney
be respected and trusted by
those he works with.

“‘T do have and would have the
backing and support of law en-
forcement and people in the
legal system — judges, clerks,
and other lawyers,” he said.

“In my brief two years in
practice, I’ve tried to be honest.
When you tell them that you'll
do something, they have to be
able to believe you.”

EC studies open exam policy
More freedom anticipated

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee ap-
pointed a subcommittee Mon-
day night to continue a study of
an open exam policy at
Washington and Lee.

Scott Mason, a junior EC rep
last year who had studied the
possibilities of an open exam
policy, reported his findings .to
the committee.

The open exam policy would
permit a student to sign up for
an exam for either 9 a.m. or 2

p.m., but he would be allowed to
take the exam any day during
the exam week at that time,
Mason explained.

In talking with department
chairmen last year, Mason said
‘“‘the majority were in favor of
an open exam policy.”

The Commerce School — ‘‘the
brunt of the problem’’— and the
math department both in-
dicated an opposition to -the
idea, though, Mason said.

“There were a lot of logistical
problems,’’ Mason said. ‘‘But I
think a lot of these problems

can be worked out. I think this is
definitely something worth
looking into.”’

Reporting on the progress of
the subcommittee studying the
possibility of more lights in the
lower parking lot, junior rep
Darby Brower said, ‘‘President
Wilson at this time doesn’t feel
the school has funds to put
lights in the lower parking lot.”

Temporary lights have been
placed in the trees, but their ef-
fectiveness has been reduced by
the leaves.

Alumni leaders to learn about
‘WGL today’ this weekend

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Washington and Lee alumni
can get ‘‘a feeling of what is go-
ing on at W&L today’’ during
the first Alumni Leadership
Conference this weekend at
W&L, said L.C. “Buddy”
Atkins, assistant alumni
secretary.

alumni following an 8 p.m. din-

Hall that will open the con-

The alumni will have lunch

with no administrators or facul-

Former political prisoner to speak

Author Jacobo Timerman
will present the first lecture in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s speaker symposium, Con-
tact ’84, on Thursday, Oct. 20.

The program will begin at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel. The public
is invited to attend, and admis-
sion is free.

A journalist, author, and pas-
sionate advocate for human
rights and social justice, Timer-
man’s outspoken condemnation
of the military regime in Argen-
tina led to his arrest and im-
prisonment.

After 18 months in prison and
under house arrest, he was
finally released in 1979 as the
result of a world-wide cam-
paign for his freedom.

In his first book, ‘‘Prisoner
Without a Name, Cell Without a
Number,’’ Timerman
vehemently criticized the

 

Argentinian government’s
repressive policies and re-
counted the story of his arrest,
imprisonment, _ interrogation,
and subsequent torture without
being formally charged.

Timerman’s life in Argentina
was the subject of a movie on’
NBC-TV last spring.

In his most recent book, “‘The
Longest War, Israel Into
Lebanon,”’ Timerman contends
that the Begin/Sharon military
incursion into Lebanon wes
detrimental to peace-keeping
efforts in the Middle East.

Timerman has contributed
articles to the New York Times,
Newsweek, and Time maga-
zine. In addition he has recently
finished filming a segment with
Walter Cronkite for ‘Walter
Cronkite’s Universe.”’ That seg-
ment is devoted to George
Orwell’s ‘‘1984.”’

Washington and Lee and what
they think of it,’’ Atkins said.

Representatives of a variety
of student groups and types of
students were invited to the
lunch, Atkins explained.

Alumni chapter presidents,
admissions representatives and
class agents were invited for
the conference, Atkins said. A
class agent ‘‘solicits his
classmates on behalf of the an-
nual fund each year,”’ he said.

The leadership conference
combines the Class Agents
Weekend and the Alumni
Special Conference.

“The purpose behind this,’’
Atkins said, ‘“‘is to educate and
inspire our chapter presidents
and our alumni admissions peo-
ple. We hope to give the chapter
presidents some new ideas and
some new life and activity.”

A session Friday morning will
feature an admissions office
presentation of the demo-
graphic statistics ‘‘that we’ve
all been hearing about’’ in rela-
tion to coeducation, Atkins said,
adding that the issue of
coeducation probably would be
discussed.

Friday afternoon sessions
will center around student life
and the curriculum changes, in-
cluding the new distribution re-
quirements and the plus-minus
grading system.

The conference will conclude
with workshops Saturday morn-
ing for each of the three types of
alumni leaders.

WGL students work with WTBS

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Virginia Military Institute’s
football team made its national
television debut last Thursday
night with the help of the WTBS
(Turner Broadcasting System)
network and 14 Washington and
Lee students.

The work done by the
students ranged from collecting
statistics to reporting on
players’ injuries. The students
received a WTBS T-shirt and
were paid $25 for their work.

Approximately 50 people
were involved in the production,
and according to Prof. Robert
DeMaria, televising the game
cost WTBS over $600,000. The
lights used for the game cost
over $50,000, DeMaria said.

DeMaria also said that work-
ing for a network, such as
WTBS, provided the students
with a good learning ex-
perience. ‘Students had a
chance to work on an actual
remote and the chance to work
with paid professionals,” he
said.

According to one WTBS
reporesentative, the network
crew working the game was
pleased with the students and
the work they did. ‘‘If I had the
chance to do it again, I would
jump at it,” DeMaria said.

Tim McCune said that what
he liked about the experience
was the fact that the WTBS
crew was concerned about the
students’ learning something as
well as getting the job done. “‘I
think it was a great learning ex-
perience,” McCune said.

Youngest frats place well in ‘‘Snag’’ average

By GERALD SHEPHERD
Staff Reporter

According to the 1983 Rush
statistics, the three youngest
fraternities at Washington and
Lee have conquered their com-
mon stumbling blocks and
taken places numerically along
side the 14 well-founded frater-
nities.

The recent ‘Snag’ figures
show that Kappa Sigma receiv-
ed 17 pledges, Chi Psi took in
nine pledges and Sigma Nu got
13 pledges, bringing the young
fraternities near the average
pledge totals of fraternities at
W&L.

All the new fraternities faced
obstacles during their for-
mative stages, including a lack
of places to meet and live, at-
tempting to receive recognition
from the university community
and raising funds.

Dan Murphy, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of Frater-
nity Affairs, said, “All three
seem to be successful in their
efforts so far.” He says that
although he would not en-
courage a new fraternity at this
time, these three seem to have
overcome most of the obstacles

and have become solid parts of
the university’s fraternity
system.

Characteristics common to
all three houses include en-
thusiasm out creating a new
fraternity 1 concern about
their status the university
system: the ac. nic leaders
for the previous tw. terms have
been Chi Psi and Sigma Nu,
respectively. Washington and
Lee now has 17 national frater-
nities.

Chi Psi, the oldest of the re-
cent additions, began at W&L in
1977. No Chi Psi chapter existed
here, and Chi Psi alumni from
other universities were in-
terested in organizing a house
at W&L. Through the fall of
1980, Chi Psi had no permanent
house; according to Paul Far-
quharson, current Chi Psi presi-
dent, ‘‘That made it difficult to
rush people.”

The national chapter wanted
to buy the old Ann~ Smith
Academy, but the City of Lex-
ington refused to sell it to them.
The alumni donated money to
W&L for the purpose of buying
the old schoolhouse. The univer-
sity then bought the Academy
with the funds from the Chi Psi

alumni. Chi Psi now leases the
house from the university. Far-
quharson said that the universi-
ty has been very cooperative in
helping them overcome the

' primary obstacle of housing.

Kappa Sigma, which lost its
charter in 1970, was reinstituted
in 1979 with 15 initiates. Steve
Lemon, former Kappa Sigma
vice-president and a senior at
W&L, said a group of students
wanted to form a fraternity that
would become an alternative to
the existing chapters. Kappa
Sigma which had been at W&L
since 1873 had a strong national
chapter in Charlottesville and a
strong alumni system and ap-
peared to be a strong possibility
for a new chapter. The Kappa
Sigma fraternity regained its
charter and university recogni-
tion in 1980, but they had no per-
manent house.

The members rushed from a
rented house on Randolph
Street, but they did not have a
“special use’”’ permit, and were
thrown out. The fraternity later
put up a bid to buy their old
house on South Main Street, but
the Lexington Zoning Board and
City Council denied the request.
During 1981 they negotiated
with the university and began to

lease the current Kappa Sigma
house (located between SAE
and Pi Phi), which had been
university property for many
years. Kappa Sigma now leases

They have raised funds from

stalled within the past year.
Lemon said Kappa Sigma was
‘‘hurting for respect”’ for a cou-

ple of years, but now the house
has become an integral part of
the system. ‘‘The house was the
key to respect,” said Lemon,
“and most freshmen probably
don’t know we are a new
house.’’ He expressed apprecia-
tion to the university and said

Sigma Nu, the most recent
addition, lost its charter in 1981

and was reinstated in 1982. The
national headquarters are
located in Lexington, and the
national made a concerted ef-
fort to restore Sigma Nu. Hous-
ing was a problem for Sigma Nu
last year. The old house was
closed, and the new members
were forced to meet in the stu-
dent center and held a couple of
parties at the Holiday Inn.

This summer, renovation
began on the house which re-
opened this fall. Washington

chapter sub-leases it from the

Chapter in organizing and fund-
raising.

Housing seems to have been
the most difficult problem for
the three new fraternities.
Alumni assistance in raising
funds and the cooperation of
W&L have helped to establish
these houses. These new houses
have made progress in recent
years. Chi Psi received nine
pledges; Kappa Sigma, 17; and
Sigma Nu, 13. The next few
years should determine the fate
of these fraternities at

Ziegler’s ‘Love Poems’ opens tomorrow night

“A bittersweet comedy” is
the way Thomas J. Ziegler,
Washington and Lee University
drama professor, describes his
newest play ‘‘Love Poems.”’

The premiere of ‘Love
Poems’’ on Oct. 14 in the Boiler
Room theater will open the
1983-84 season of W&L’s Univer-
sity Theatre.

The three-act comedy will
star Shirley Ziegler of Lex-
ington as Mert Plucker and
W&L law student Philip Brown
as Frank Stimson. David Con-
ners, a W&L sophomore, will
round out the cast as Mert’s
comatose father. Senior drama
major Bob Ferguson will direct
the production.

“Love Poems’’ introduces
Mert, a woman of about 30 who
lives in New York’s East
Village and is attempting to
break out of her humdrum life
as a truck dispatcher and nurse
to her comatose father. She
enrolls in an American

literature class at NYU and
eventually becomes involved in
a bizarre relationship with her
professor (Frank).

“It is a case of opposites —she
is poor, stolid uneducated; he is
wealthy, knowledgable, prep-
pie,’’ says Ziegler. ‘‘They work
together to solve each other’s
problems.”’

This is not the first work in
which Ziegler utilizes opposites.
Both of his previous plays,
‘Weeds’ and ‘The Ninth
Step,”’ were written in a similar
style.

“T like to contrast humor and
tragedy,” says Zeigler. ‘‘My
works are comedies with
serious overtones. They delve
into fairly heavy emotions.”

What inspires a playwright to
create characters like Mert and
Frank and put them on stage for
all to meet?

Ziegler, ‘‘That happens to be
the setting for ‘Love Poems.’
The apartment had only three
rooms and we had to share the
bath down the hall with our
neighbors. Most of these
neighbors were Polish im-
migrants. Puerto Ricans lived
downstairs. We were the only
ones who spoke English. Mert
and Frank are based on the type
of people I met there.

“IT am very New York-
oriented,’ Ziegler continued.
“To make it in New York is
THE sign of success to a
dramatist. Broadway is the
ultimate. If you are going to
dream, you might as well

Broadway.

Those dreams of Broadway
may soon come true for the
graduate of Northern [Illinois
University. Ziegler’s play ‘“‘The
Ninth Step” is scheduled to
open off broadway in New York
in February.

At the present time, Zeigler
has three new scripts in the
works.

“I try to write each day,’’
says Ziegler. ‘‘There are
moments when I am in the
mood to write but more often I
am not. Sometimes I have to
make myself work. But once I
get started, it is very enjoyable.
The characters I create seem
like old friends. To leave them
for a while and come back to
them is like renewing old
friendships.”’

DuPont displays Japanese prints

By SCOTT S. PRYSI
Special to the Phi

From October 7 to the 30th a
well-known collection of
Japanese woodblock prints on
loan from the Virginia Museum
will be on exhibit in the DuPont
Gallery. The show titled
“Hiroshige: The Tokaido
Road” is a collection of 48 prints
made between 1833 and 1834 by
the renowned Japanese artist
Ando Hiroshige (1797-1858). The

prints depict images of 19th cen-
tury Japanese life along the 300-
mile-long Tokaido Road which
in the 1930’s linked the
Tokugawa Shugunates’ ad-
ministrative capital at Tokyo
with the Imperial Residence of
the Emperor to the southwest in
Kyoto.

Hiroshige is known for his
ability to catch the precise
mood and feeling of a scene.
Characteristically (in his

prints) he tries to express the
grandeur of nature surrounding
and enriching human life, using
figures only as small elements
of the whole composition. Ac-
cording to the Virginia
Museum’s Asiatic curator Dr.
Joseph Dye, ‘‘Hiroshige focused
mainly on the changing effects
of time, the seasons, and light.”’
His work is often described as
“‘melancholic”’ due to the sub-
tle, soft, and gentle beauty he
portrays.

record and setting the stage for ¢

the Generals’ 44-7 romp over
the Maryville Scots last Satur-
day at Wilson Field.

Weaver, a reserve tailback,

took a hand-off from junior Tom @

Wiser, who received the kick,
and raced untouched down the
sidelines into the end zone.
Sophomore James White con-

verted the PAT, making the #

score 7-0) only 16 seconds into
the game.

W&L held a commanding 24-0 §

lead at the half as Gene Girard
and Frank Surface both scored
on short runs and James White
added a 26-yard field goal. The
Maryville offense was stymied
by the General defense in the
first half, mustering only 63
yards.

Head coach Gary Fallon
stated that the Generals ‘‘had
worked on that play a bit in
practice this (last) week and
asked Kevin before the game if
he was ready. He said he was,
so we went for it. That had to
sting them a little bit.”’

“‘Our defense played one heck
of a game,” Fallon said. ‘‘I was
particularly pleased with the
way the people up front played.
Marty Manasco was back in ac-
tion for the first time since the
opener and he played very
well.”’

Maryville got its lone
touchdown early in the third
quarter when quarterback Pat

Moyer connected with Pat |

Foster for a 56-yard strike. This
one play accounted for nearly
half the Scots’ total yardage for
the entire game. Fallon said,

Sneakers, athletes for sale

..Ralph Sampson wants a
new pair of sneakers. The pro-
blem is everyone who makes
sneakers wants to buy him a
pair. And that’s not all, they’ll
pay him to wear theirs. And he
can even design his own and
wear new shoes every day. All
this is his just for wearing
somebody’s little doo dad on the
side of his foot. Yes, that’s
where we are now. And Samp-
son’s not getting paid small
change, only more money a
year than my parents have
made in their lives. And Samp-
son’s not alone. There’s John
McEnroe turning a cool $600,000
a year for using a particular
tennis racket. And of course
there are the contracts college
coaches sign to outfit their
teams with a particular shoe,

 

   

helmet and Lord knows what
other kinds of equipment. The
problem here lies with the idea
of endorsement money itself. I
agree you should get as much as
you can, but let’s look at it from
the other side. Why do these
companies insist on always giv-

ing (throwing away) as much

an awful lot of undue faith in
the ability of one man to sell
millions of shoes by his tace
alone. I don’t know about you,
but the only guy who ever sold
me a pair of sneakers worked at
the local sporting goods store,
and even then I tried them on
first...

..It is perhaps a tribute to
this Generals’ football team
that they can play such an in-

The Washington and Lee har-
riers improved their season
record this past weekend to 7-1.
The Generals took first in a
quadrangular meet in Harrison-
burg. W&L finished first with a
score of 27 followed by Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
foe Catholic Univ., American
University and Eastern Men-
nonite.

Coach Dick Miller said, ‘‘We
ran well and we had a good
close group of runners.’’ This is
evident by only a 41-second
span separating W&L’s second
through fifth finishers. Frank
Pittman was the leader of this
group finishing fifth. He was
followed by Ed Gourdry, Bob
Glenn and Paul Chapman,
Coach Miller also noted that for

 

Harriers go to 7-1

the first time this season top
finisher Angus McBryde finish-
ed under 27 minutes at 26:52.

This week the Generals will
be host to nine women’s teams
and 13 men’s teams for the
Virginia Division II and Divi-
sion III meet. Coach Miller
commented that being at home
is not a great advantage in this
meet. He also mentioned that it
would be a tougher test for his
team than usual because only
seven participants are allowed
per school.

“If someone has a bad day
there will be no one to pick up
the slack.”’

Featured in the meet are such
powers as Liberty Baptist, Divi-
sion II, Roanoke College, who
defeated Washington and Lee
two weeks ago, and Radford,
another Division II power.

Jenevein waits and watches

By GREG AYDT
Staff Reporter

Two weeks ago, W&L football
team captain Bob Jenevein was
injured in the game against
Centre College.

The athletic department
reported that Jenevein was out
for the season. Rumors have
begun circulating though, that
these reports were too
pessimistic, and that perhaps
he might be available before
seasons end.

The injury occurred on the
last play of the first half. Jene-
vein was the only player in a
position to prevent a possible

ODAC depends on

touchdown by Centre’s tight
end. The players’ collision
prompted groans from the
crowd but Jenevein said he
didn’t realize that he was in-
jured until he tried to sit up.
When he tried, he felt a lot of
pain and he knew he ‘‘wasn’t go-
ing anywhere.”’

Initially there was confusion
as to the extent of his injuries.
There were two possibilities:

either stretched or crushed
nerves in the neck. In the
former case, the injury would
only be temporary, but in the
latter, there was the possiblity
that the damage would be per-
manent. The effect of the injury
was a numbing and a loss of
control. Dr. James Busch of the
W&L infirmary, as well as a
local orthopedic surgeon, and a
local neurologist, said that
Jevenein was definitely out for
the rest of the season.

Ten days after the injury, a
test was done in Staunton. The
results were encouraging, in-
dicating no permanent damage.
The prognosis was for a
recovery in about five months.
In the time since, feeling and
control have returned. Jenevein
jokingly credits some of this to
‘“‘shoulder medicine’ he has
gotten from home — cookies.

Jenevein didn’t suit up two
weeks ago against Randolph-
Macon, but did in last week’s
game with Maryville.

Even though he knew he
couldn’t play, suiting up enabl-
ed him to participate in cap-
tains’ conferences and ‘“‘fell like
part of the team.”

‘He has the same plans for this
week’s game against Hampden-
Sydney. “But maybe next
week,”’ he says. Nerves heal at
their own pace and he realizes
he may not be able to play
again.

Jenevein believes the team
can win the ODAC champion-
ship without him, because “‘suc-
cess in the ODAC depends on

the ability to take it one game at
a time, and this team is
especially capable of doing
that,” he said.

“IT want to play as much as
possible,”’ he said. So for now he
takes it one game at a time, too.
He sees improvement in the lit-
tle daily things...lifting a
Stapler, for example. Whether
he will play and for how long is
just a question of time.

Polo goes 4-0 at tournament

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team dominated
their opposition in its first
weekend of Southern League
play. Sweeping the field in the
Southern League (Zone I) Tour-
nament, the Generals captured
four victories against no
defeats. The tournament was
played at the Cy Twombly pool.

‘We played pretty well. The
competition was not as strong
as I had hoped it would be,”’
head coach Page Remillard
said. Remillard also stated,
“‘We were able to execute a lot
of good offense and defense last
weekend.”’

Although the Generals’ vic-
tories were expected last
weekend, Southern League play
is crucial to the future of the
Generals. The regular season

Concerning individual perfor-

The W&L B team also par-

weekend. Filling the vacancy
left by VMI, who did not par-
ticipate Saturday because of
their Homecoming activities,
the B team received a major
setback. Opponents stung the

This weekend the Generals
will participate in the Southeast
Varsity Invitational at An-

will be played on Saturday and

The tournament is the conclu-
sion to the Northeast Varsity In-
vitational which was played at
Brown University on Sept. 23, 24
and 25. This weekend the
Generals are scheduled to play
Brown, George Washington
University, Harvard and
Bucknell.

Remillard believes that the
key to the Generals success this
weekend relies upon the
Generals’ ability to score goals,
and while the Generals rest key
players, to limit goals scored by
opponents. Regarding the tour-
nament, Remillard said, “‘If we
can win two games, I will be
very happy.”

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team scored two home vic-
tories over non-league op-
ponents this week, defeating the
Messiah Falcons, 2-1, on Satur-
day, and VMI, 4-0, in Tuesday’s
3rd Annual United Fund Cup.

The victory over Messiah was
the Generals’ first in three
years of playing the Falcons,
who were ranked fourth in the
national Division III poll before
the game.

The victory over Division I
VMI marked goalie Jay
Werner’s third shutout of the
season and gave the Generals a
5-2 record. W&L leads the
United Cup Fund series, 2-1.

Sophomore forward Bill
Hoomes got both the goals
against Messiah, taking advan-
tage of defensive errors by the
Falcons both times. When
Falcon goalie David Young
couldn’t cleanly handle Mark
Sullivan’s shot, Holmes was
there to send in the rebound for
a 1-0 lead just before healftime.

» And at the 67 minute mark
% Holmes’ throw-in deflected off

Messiah’s Dale Mylin into his
own goal for a 2-0 W&L lead.
Head coach Rolf Piranian
praised his team for its oppor-
tunistic play on the two goals,
commenting that it was ‘‘good
soccer’’ being there for the re-
bound on the first goal. Of the
second goal he said, ‘‘We’ve
worked hard on re-starts (like
the throw-in) in practice. We

forced them into making that
error.”

The Falcons threatened late
in the game, scoring with 6:48
left for the 2-1 final score.

The Generals dominated in
the 4-0 victory over the Keydets,
producing their highest score of
the season. Piranian com-
mented that his players looked
like they were “finally fired up
about playing.”’

Holmes nearly got his third
goal in a row for the Generals
on a fast break with nine
minutes left in the first half, but
Keydet goalie Sean Miller trip-
ped him in the penalty box,
leading to Roland Simon’s
fourth goal of the season on the
ensuing penalty kick.

Holmes did get his third goal
of the season in the second half,
however, as he took Steve
McGrath’s centering pass from
the right side and gave the
Generals a 2-0 lead.

Freshman Peter Van Son got
his first college career goal 15
minutes later, and McGrath
brought the total to four, thanks
to an assist by Gary Clements.

W&L goes on the road next
week, traveling to Gettysburg
College on Saturday and
visiting ODAC adversary
Lynchburg College on Wednes-
day.

Gettysburg, winner of four
games in a row, ‘‘will be the
toughest test so far,” according
to Piranian. ‘“‘They’re looking
forward to playing us because
we stuck it to them last time,’’
he said.

Pennsylvania, the Jersey
royal hari-kari over last
weekend’s picks. This week I’ll
let up on the Prophet of
Presumption with some
hopefully less troublesome
tries. The proclamations are 1)
“If the Generals get behind ear-
ly, they’ll be in trouble against
H-SC. Cannot have a letdown
from last week. Generals by
five.’’ 2) On the pro scene, the
Prophet takes Detroit, Pitts-
burgh, New York (needless to
say he hasn’t picked anyone
over his Giants or Jets yet).
And on Monday night he’ll take
the Packers over the ’Skins just
to make you upset — as if he
needs any additional help. 3)
Finally, on the World Series, the
Prince warns that the O’s will
be hurt by the lack of a DH.
Steve Carlton could also prove
to be a nuisance. However, as
long as Palmer stays closer to
the booth than the field
Baltimore’s pitching should
give them the edge. ‘‘Baltimore

serious side, or is it really? The

Fraternity influence too much on the Hill?

To the Editors:

Last week in the ‘Front
Lawn” section of the Phi, John
Cleghorn wrote the following in
considering the fraternity situa-
tion: ‘‘President Wilson must
be allowed the opportunity to
simply raise the questions. And,
in turn, the fraternities must
give ample time and study to
the questions which affect 800
men at Washington and Lee.”
The sentence, even the article,
is well written. The number,
however, haunts me. 800. Just
800. What, may I ask, ever hap-
pened to the rest of us? Am I to
understand that the fraternity
situation here at W&L doesn’t
affect those 550 of us who have
chosen to remain indepen-
dents? Gentlemen, I am one
such independent. I don’t feel
the effects of the fraternity
system like I don’t feel the ef-
fects of an enema. Actually, as
a junior, it doesn’t bother me
much anymore. But for you
freshmen who didn’t go the
mainstream route, your
headaches have just begun.

Enough of the metaphors, let
me get specific. I hate to use the
Mock Convention people as an
example (because I think they
are doing an outstanding job
getting that thing together), but
when I went in for an interview
for a convention position last
week, the first question I was
asked was ‘“‘What fraternity are
you in?” Although I recall giv-
ing a polite answer, what I real-
ly wanted to say was, ‘‘What in
the hell does my being in a
fraternity have to do with my
wanting a responsible position
in the Mock Convention?’’
Never mind the fact that I
wasn’t even asked “‘if”’ I was in
a frat as opposed to ‘“which.”’
Never mind the fact my inter-
viewer didn’t even consider the
possibility that I might be a
member of the 40 percent of this
student body which many peo-
ple choose to pretend doesn’t
exist. Gentlemen, what I want
to know is what the hell dif-
ference does it make? If I’m not
in a fraternity does that mean
I’m some sort of goob introvert
who can’t handle a responsible
position because I can’t com-
municate with other people? Is
there something about hazing
freshmen and abusing women
that teaches one something ex-
tra about the American political
process? What is the point of
this question other than to make
me feel excluded from the
university of which I am a stu-
dent? Gentlemen, for three
years I have tolerated that
fraternity-membership ques-
tion. For you freshmen who
didn’t join frats, get used to it.
It’s like a horsefly in your ear,
except you can’t kill it. And,
just for you poor souls, here are
some helpful hints on when it
will pop up: 1) Applications.
Every application you will ever
fill out here at W&L will have
‘include social fraternities” in
the activities section. Don’t
worry that it might be totally ir-

revelant, the people giving you
the applications just want to
know. However, don’t let them
think you are anti-social. Tell
them you throw-up every Satur-
day night.

2) At the womens’ colleges.
You are probably already very
familiar with this one. It is
always the first thing you are
asked. It takes precedence over
your name. Don’t get upset.
Fraternities are the only things
ladies have ever been exposed
to at W&L. Probably they are
just trying to make conversa-
tion. Smile and chuckle gently.
Say, “No, I’m not. But just
because you had a bad ex-
perience with one is no reason
you shouldn’t go back to W&L
for four years.”

3) Professors. They will ask
you about your fraternity
membership when you go into
their offices to visit. This is
where it’s to your benefit, guys.
When asked, look disgusted.
Say ‘‘Heavens no I’m not ina
fraternity. I find them a serious

detriment to our academic com-
munity, don’t you?”’

Unfortunately, gentlemen, it
doesn’t end with just questions.
The university obviously caters
toward a fraternity environ-
ment. Did you play basketball
in high school? Did you enjoy
it? Do you want to play in-
tramurals here? Better join a
frat, Bud. Athletics are for the
sociable, not goob introverts.
Go play Dungeons and Dragons,
or whatever it is you non-
partiers do.

But it extends further.
Gentlemen, it’s like a cancer.
Homecoming, Fancy Dress,
these weekends also serve to re-
mind you that you are outside
the mainstream. Sure the SAB
does an excellent job of pro-
viding bands and activities for
the entire university, but the
subtle reminders will smack
you in the face. How about the

themselves with the facts sur-
rounding the issue. Let me
briefly present some of them.

Proponents of coeducation
point to a 26 percent drop in the
total number of applicants to
American colleges in the next 10
years. Those future applicants
have already been born and
counted. In the 15 states from
which W&L attracts most of its
students, there will be an even
more dramatic 35 percent drop.
In addition, coeducation’s ad-
vocates cite the increasing
tendency of high school
graduates to choose public over
private institutions. They point
out also that the percentage of
all college students who are
male has declined from 65 per-
cent in 1963 to 48 percent today,
suggesting the increasing role
women play in American higher
education.

In light of these statistics,
many propose coeducation as a
means of maintaining current
academic standards without
cutting the size of the freshman
class. According to the Admis-
sions Committee, to maintain
our high standards as well as
our single-sex status would
mean about a 33 percent
decrease in the freshman class
of 1993, and a revenue deficit of
about $600,000 per year. On the
other hand, to accept women
would not only double the eli-
gible applicants, but many
more male students would con-
sider W&L, perhaps 60 percent
more.

The question that Washington
and Lee must answer is not
simply, “‘Would we go coed?”
but rather ‘Should we go coed
as a response to the multiple
signs of bad times to come?”’
Opponents of coeducation still
say ‘‘No.”’

To many, coeducation is
simply not an alternative at
Washington and Lee. To them,
the acceptance of women in
order to survive, isn’t survival
at all. The arguments on this
side of the issue are more in-
tangible. It seems that many at
the school believe the all-male
status has quite a lot to do with
the uniqueness of the institu-
tion; and that to remove that
would be to transform the in-
stitution into something it has
never been and to destroy what
was. Opponents of coeducation
question the ability of a woman
to react as enthusiastically as a
man to the inspiration of Robert
E. Lee, who spent his life as a
leader of men, and in whom so
much of our great tradition is
founded. In short, they hold that
the great thing about
Washington nad Lee is its uni-
queness, and when the uni-
queness dies, so does the col-
lege.

To answer the question of
coeducation of W&L, we must
first answer many other ques-
tions, as individuals and as an
institution. In order for a stu-
dent voice to be heard and
respected, it must be in-
telligently expressed. Let me

encourage you to attack the
issue, learn about it, and make
a well founded decision on your
own position before the next
poll. Talk about it with your
friends. Write to the Executive
Committee or to the Ring-tum
Phi. Make posters or banners
expressing your view, but be
heard. Then no matter what the
result, or how permanent, we
will have made our feelings
known, and no one will say the
Student Body of 1983-84 sat idly
by.

‘parties? Once again, it really
doesn’t bother me much any
more. AS an upperclassman,
my apartment has facilities to
accommodate this relaxing sort
of social function. For you
freshmen in dorms, however, I
can offer no suggestion.

Sometimes gentlemen, the
Situation is just plain sad.
Omicron Delta Kappa is an
honor society, on campus that
recognizes leadership. It is a
very respectable organization.
However, one of the categories

amidst its criterion is labelled
“‘social.’”” Now how does one
cultivate social leadership
skills at W&L if one is not in a
fraternity? Good question. It’s
kind of like getting a football

scholarship without ever having
played football. And how about
all the news about President
Wilson’s meeting with the
fraternity leaders about the
grave social situation? For you
independents who make up
close to half of our student body,
you have no voice. It’s not as if

your opinion would make any
difference, it’s just that you
have no opinion.

Gentlemen, I realize I’m be-
ing sarcastic. For that matter, I
also realize I’m being some-
what nasty. But gentlemen, I
am ashamed. During classes
and on the colonnade, I meet in-
telligent and friendly guys. And
on weekends, when I go to frat
parties, the brothers I know go
out of their way to make me feel
welcome and comfortable. But
during the week, I want frater-
nities out of areas where they
don’t belong. And if that cannot
be the situation, then I want to
feel like a contributing member
and a counted voice at this in-
stitution. This university
thrives in honor, yet there is no
honor in — when it is convenient
— pretending that 550 students
simply do not exist. I am proud
of this school, and I firmly
believe it is of too high a quality
for this kind of situation.

But, sadly, my beliefs only
seem to matter if I’m in a
fraternity.

Coed vote unknown

To the Editors:

Coeducation is an issue of
great importance to this fine in-
stitution. I’ve decided how I
stand on this question. Bob
Jenevein and Todd Smith have
decided how they stand. Unfor-
tunately this is not the case with
quite a few of our fellow
students. Hard facts — i.e. ad-
missions projections — have
been sadly hard to come by.
Last year’s Phi staff, and
perhaps this year’s as well, has
reported the issue from a biased
point of view. A referendum
vote scheduled for, and I quote
the Phi, ‘‘...after the first year

law and freshman class elec- ©

tions are over’’ was held all but
secretly — and at least a week
early On Wednesday, Oct. 3, at
an unattended polling place
beside the C-school. I voted. The
vast majority of students I
queried did not.

I hereby submit that if the
E.C. wants a true indication of
student opinion, they should
schedule another referendum,
and properly publicize it. The
option of voting ‘‘UNDECID-
ED” should be included on the
ballot, and law students should
also be polled, if only in a

separate survey. Law students
share our facilities, live
amongst us, and even sit on the
E.C., and they have also ex-
perienced a coeducational col-
lege environment, some of them
even ARE women. Certainly
the opinions of the law students
would be of interest to any can-
did unbiased survey.

The Ring-tum Phi should con-
sider its moral duty to provide
accurate, unbiased reporting of
the facts behind this issue.
Editorials should be labeled as
such. Even the undecided will
agree, the issue of coeducation
is of primary importance to this
university’s future, and if we as
students are to voice yea or
nay; we need facts to decide
wisely.

Finally I quote the founder of
that other university across Af-
ton Mountain: ‘‘For here we are
not afraid to follow the truth,
wherever it may lead, nor to
tolerate any error as long as
reason is left to combat it.”
May we here at THE university
of Virginia be so wise as to
follow Thomas Jefferson’s ad-
vice.

“In public,” according to the
