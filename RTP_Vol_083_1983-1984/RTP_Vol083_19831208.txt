VOLUME 83

New trustees

include
Tom Wolfe

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Four new members of the Washington
ind Lee Board of Trustees were announc-
ed Friday, including Tom Wolfe, author of
the best-selling book, The Right Stuff which
Sa major current movie.

\lso named were James F. Gallivan,
National Sales Manager for J.C. Bradford
& Co. in Nashville; Frances A. Lewis, ex-
ecutive vice president of Best Products Co
n Richmond; and Charles S. Rowe, the
editor and co-publisher of the
redericksburg Free Lance-Star.

The four were elected to six-year terms
which begin on Jan. 1

jack Warner, the Alabama paper com-
pany executive for whom the Warner
\thletic Center is named, is retiring from
the Board and will become a Trustee
Emeritus.

Frank Brooks, E. Waller Dudley, and
Sydney Lewis have all served the max-
imum allowed twelve consecutive years on
the Board, and will be eligible for re-
election in a vear.

James Whitehead, secretary of the
University and by virtue of that office
secretary of the Board of Trustees, said
that Gallivan was elected to the Board by a
vote of the University’s alumni.

He said that the alumni recommend a
candidate for Trustee in that way every
two years. The other three were chosen
first by the Board’s nominating commit-
tee, and were then elected at the October
meeting of the trustees.

James M. Ballengee, Rector of the
Board, said that the four accepted their ap-
pointments within 10 days of that meeting.

University President John D. Wilson
said, ‘‘In any active renewal you have feel-
ings of loss, to be sure, but also feelings of
anticipation for the new talent and new
ideas you'll have access to.””

Wilson pointed out that until the institu-

tion of six year terms, members served un-

til they chose to retire.

“Great trustees came out of that tradi-
tion,” he said. ‘‘This way, though, you br-

ing new ideas and new energy to bear and
share the governance responsibility.”’

Wilson said he met Wolfe, a 1951 W&L
graduate, at a conference in Richmond at
which they both spoke two years ago.

He said that he met with Gallivan, a
classmate of Wolfe’s who was national
president of the Alumni Association in
1981-82, shortly after his election to the
presidency of the university last year.

Wilson said that he and his wife had
spent a week at the summer home of
Frances Lewis, wife of retiring trustee
Sydney Lewis, the chairman of Best Pro-

ducts.

‘“They’re a partnership in a very ex-
traordinary way,’ Wilson said. ‘‘Their
love for W&L is mutual and shared. She’s a
strong personality in her own right, and an
outstanding addition to the board.’’ Lewis
Hall is named for her.

The president said that this year he had
been the guest of Rowe at Strattord Hall,
the Lee ancestral home on the Potomac
and birthplace of Robert E. Lee. Rowe, a
1947 graduate, also attended Wilson’s in-
auguration last spring.

Plus-minus
stands
despite
protest

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

 

The faculty has rejected the Executive
Committee’s request that the plus-minus
grading system not affect upperclassmen.

During the faculty meeting Monday
afternoon, no faculty member moved that
a vote be taken on the issue, according to
Edward Atwood, dean of the Commerce
School.

A new motion would have had to been
made on the issue for a vote to have been
taken, Atwood said, because the Faculty
Committee on Courses and Degrees voted
against recommending the proposal to the
entire faculty.

“If anyone on the faculty had wanted to
change that, he would have had to make
another motion,’’ Atwood said. ‘‘There
was no motion to change our present
system.”

EC President Bob Jenevein presented
the students’ case to the faculty and cited
last week’s poll that showed 83 percent of
the students voted against having the plus-
minus system affect upperclassmen. Dean
of Students Lewis John told the faculty

Faculty takes latest round over
students with plus/minus victory

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Another chapter in the saga of
administration/faculty-student
relations has come to an end,
and the faculty has won the
latest round.

A little more than a month
ago, the Executive Committee
began lobbying against the
plus-minus grading system’s af-
fecting upperclassmen. Those
of you who were around in April
1982 will recall the faculty’s ap-
proval of that system to go into
effect this fall.

It was there, though, that the
problems perhaps began. Many
students assumed the changes
would be phased in, just as the
distribution requirements and

Comment

 

the increased graduation re-
quirements were.

Such was not to be the case,
though, as The Ring-tum Phi
reported in its first issue this
year. The plus-minus system
would affect everybody at the
same time.

Here is where the second pro-
blem occurred. Rather than im-
mediately jumping on the band-
wagon of change, the EC waited
until the end of October before
deciding to poll students on the
issue and then didn’t hold the
poll until last week.

It must be noted here that the
EC was not complaining about
the new grading system per se,
EC President Bob Jenevein and
the students were arguing that
the system shouldn’t affect up-
perclassmen who came to W&L
under a_ different grading
system.

Indeed, Jenevein has
acknowledged that the plus-
minus system is a good idea,
and I tend to agree.

However, by waiting until the

last minute, the EC had to con-
duct a poll (83 percent of
students against plus-minus af-
fecting upperclassmen) and
petition the faculty committee
on courses and degrees, the
University Council and the
faculty as a whole all within a
week and all just before exams.

Although this delay brought
what may have been justified
criticism of the EC, it was not
reason enough for the faculty’s
out-of-hand rejection of the peti-
tion.

But the faculty did just that.

Last Thursday’s University
Council meeting was almost
more of a farce than the EC’s
coeducation poll. Jenevein was
prepared to logically discuss
the issue with the faculty and
administration, but the faculty
and administration did not
seem to be prepared to listen.

Faculty, particularly Deans
Atwood and Watt, continually
interupted Jenevein’s state-
ments and showed little respect
for his position.

Atwood complained that he
might have to give a freshman
and a sophomore in the same
course different grades.(He
didn’t mention that because the
two students were in different
classes, they would never be
compared to each other for
ODK, Who’s Who, or Phi Beta

Kappa.)
Watt told the EC president,
“That (argument) really

doesn’t hold water, Mr. Jene-
vein.”

Oh, and then there was that
compromise that said students
who failed to graduate because
of plus-minus might receive
special consideration from the
automatic rule committee.

Of course, it didn’t quite say
that. It suggested that the
courses and degrees committee
consider doing that.

It was not a recommendation.
(‘I wouldn’t vote for that,” said

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year at
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for the Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the Chief Editors and Business Manager, but the Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

 

 

 

Dr. Harlan Beckley.)

The compromise also means
little because a student who
falls under the automatic rule
can petition the committee to
reconsider his status if there
have been extenuating cir-
cumstances. Suddenly being
graded under a new system in
one’s senior year could be con-
sidered an extenuating cir-
cumstance, one would hope.

Nevertheless, the point is that
the student members of the UC
were willing to listen to the
faculty, willing to accept a com-
promise. The faculty members
rather obviously just wanted to
go home, and thus no action was
taken on the real _ issue
—whether plus-minus should af-
fect upperclassmen.

One would have hoped that
Jenevein would have been
treated with a little more
respect when he made his
presentation to the entire facul-
ty Monday.

Unfortunately, he was not.
Not one faculty member in Nor-
then Auditorium was willing to
stand up and make the neces-
sary motion to support the EC’s
peittion. In fact, there was little
discussion on an issue 83 per-
cent of the students supported.

Because faculty meetings are
closed (even Jenevein was ex-
cused after his statement), no
one will know exactly what was
said. What resulted, though,
was an insensitive repudiation
of the student body’s wishes.

Dean Attwood’s comment to
me this week is typical: ‘‘What
is there to discuss?” he asked
rhetorically.

But listen to Jenevein at Mon-
day’s EC meeting: ‘‘We very
logically expressed what seem-
ed to me a very soundly-based
student sentiment and they
completely, insensitively turn-
ed their backs on us. There was
clearly no desire on the part of
the faculty to accommodate our
request.”’

Jenevein also described the
faculty as ‘‘closed-minded,
cold.”

“T got the distinct impression
that they didn’t want to bother
with having different grading
systems,’’ he added.

Whatever the faculty’s opi-
nions and wishes, there was ab-
solutely no need for the lack of
respect apparently accorded
Jenevein, the EC and the stu-
dent body.

Only one good thing resulted
from this confrontation: an-
nouncements of the UC meeting
included the items on the agen-
da.

That is the first step toward
improving relations.

But after the faculty’s actions
this week, we apparently still
have a long way to go.

To the Editors:

This has been an interesting
year to read the Ring-tum Phi.
The numerous letters reveal an
unusual level of interest in the
issues under consideration. It is
clear that Washington and Lee
has entered a period of self-
examination that may lead to
significant changes in this in-
stitution. Although all of the
issues now being discussed
(coeducation, fraternities,
grading, distribution re-
quirements, and calendar)
have been considered before,
never have so many issues been
debated at the same time; nor
has the probability of change
seemed so likely.

I think most of us in this com-
munity welcome the open de-
bate, and we are glad to see the

free exchange of ideas and sen-
timents, but some of the
statements now being made
reveal misconceptions and a
lack of understanding. Among
the misconceptions sometimes
stated are the idea that ‘‘the
faculty” is of a-single mind on
the issues and that President
Wilson is in some way responsi-
ble for the problems now being
debated.

I have been a member of this
faculty for nearly twenty-five
years. Rarely has the faculty
voted unanimously on anything.
Only slightly more than half

when it was adopted in 1970, at
least a third disagreed with the

We are immensely disturbed
by the erroneous information

that his written word is com-
pletely inaccurate regarding
the “Generals” during the W&L

To the Editors:

As a member of the Washing-

ball team, I found Dr. Williams’
letter in the Dec. 1 issue of The
Ring-tum Phi very distress-
ing. As a four-year member of
the team, I have never known it
(the team) to behave in a man-
ner that was anything less than
that of class. The W&L Tip-Off
Tournament was no exception.
Since Dr. Williams was one of
the few people from the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty present, I find it very disturb-
ing that his account to that com-
munity was very much in error.

Every member of the team
and its coach was there for a
half or better, and over half of
the ‘‘tournament hosts’’ not on-
ly were present for the awards
ceremony, but also were en-
thusiastic in their support of the
efforts of those two teams. I find
it almost unforgivable that the
eventual author of such a
pointed letter could overlook
such a fact.

has necessitated this response
to assure that the W&L stand-
ards have been upheld by the
basketball team family. The
team did perform in a courteous
and responsible manner. They
were visibly present and sup-
portive of their school’s tourna-
ment.

The sparse crowd attending
the game is another reason why
it seems unlikely that such an
oversight by a college professor
could take place and we hope
the W&L community will con-
tinue to support such a fine
representative of the university
as the basketball team.

Pub Board could have purse strings tightened

Is reserve fund an unfair financial advantage ?

by SCOTT MASON

The final Ring-tum Phi issue
for 1983 has at long last arrived.
It’s called the Christmas issue,
but the Phi isn’t celebrating. Its
Christmas came last
September at the Executive
Committee budget hearing. At
that hearing, the EC donned
white beards and red suits and
handed the Phi a Christmas gift
of $13,000. Santa Claus had
come to town.

It’s not as if the Phi is hurting
for money. Until recently, it had
access to about 8,000 extra
dollars tucked away for safe
keeping. It’s lost some of that
money now, but still has several
thousand surplus dollars. The
money has come from left-over
budget funds which the Phi
always seems to save at the end

of each school year. But the Phi
alone doesn’t share that money.
It, along with the Calyx and the
Ariel, are all governed by
what’s known as the Publica-
tions Board, and the money is
part of the Pub Board Reserve

Fund. If the Phi, Calyx or Ariel
gets into financial trouble, they
always have the reserve fund to
bail them out. The money is also
available for legal fees and
possible libel suits. Whatever
its use, the extra money makes
for a nice security blanket

which other committees don’t
have.

But that’s exactly the pro-
blem. While the Phi, Calyx and
Ariel are sitting financially fat,
other committees are desper-
ately searching their pockets to
come up with enough money
just to survive. The question
some people are asking is why
The Ring-tum Phi, The Calyx
and the Ariel continue to get
money from the Executive
Committee when there’s all this
surplus cash sitting in the Pub
Board Reserve Fund? Why not
force these organizations to dip
into the reserve fund? That
way, money that would have or-
dinarily been budgeted to them
could then be allocated to less
wealthy orginizations? In other
words, why not take from the
rich and give to the poor?

That was the issue that came
in front of the Executive Com-
mittee last year. At budget
hearings this year, no mention
of it was made.

Some say there’s a definite
need for a Pub Board Reserve
Fund. ‘It’s a necessary re-
source,” insists Peter Cronin,
Pub Board secretary and Calyx
editor. Unless the EC will pro-
mise to come to the rescue of
the Calyx when financial
emergencies arise, the reserve
fund must be left intact, he said.

Pub Board President and
Ring-tum Phi Editor Rick
Swagler agrees that the reserve
fund is necessary. From the
Phi’s point of view, it’s essential
that the paper have a degree of
financial independence from
the EC. Without the reserve
fund, it would have to go begg-

ing to the EC for money. That
would then give the EC
‘leverage’ over the Phi,
Swagler said. Total control of
the purse strings by the EC
could damage the objectivity of
the Phi’s coverage. As Swagler
put it, ‘It’s awfully hard to be
critical of someone when you
have to go to them for your din-

‘Gimme gimme’ and the Christmas ghost

By MARKHAM S. PYLE

“Gloria in Excelsis Deo Et in
terra pax hominibus bonae
voluntatis.”’

December 6th is the feast day
of one Nicholas, Bishop of Myra
in the 4th century. St. Nicholas
was a good and godly man. He
lived in a subtropical climate.
He was an humble and self-
effacing servant of God.

Nowadays, of course, he is
known in a debased form as
Santa Claus, has been sent
north to live (surrounded by
aeronautically-minded _rein-
deer), and is the patron saint of
merchants and advertisers,
regardless of creed.

I will tell you how St. Nicholas
was picked for this role. In his
day in Asia Minor, there surviv-
ed a variety of barbaric cus-
toms. Many of the poorer folk
had had to sell themselves or
their children into slavery or

Criticism of Wilson refuted

(continued from page 2)
inany opposed the change in
grading approved in 1982; and
we have argued over how to and
whether or not to regulate
fraternities ever since I got
here. Because there are so
many of us and because we are
such a diverse group fully
capable of shifting responsibili-
ty to others, ‘‘the faculty’’ can
withstand criticism easily. It is
a much more serious matter
when unfair criticisms are
leveled at individuals as has
happened with President
Wilson in some recent letters to
the Ring-tum Phi.

In the most recent instance, it
is alleged that President Wilson
is trying to change the calen-
dar. The calendar is under con-
sideration because.a number of
faculty members think other
calendars would be better
suited to meet the academic ob-

prostitution. One unfortunate

household was in worse straits
than most. The three daughters
of its unhappy head had no
chance of marriage, for they
had neither a dowry nor any
hope of one. No hope, that is, un-
til their bishop heard of their
plight. One cold night, he took
horse and rode out into the
bleak hills. He crept to a win-

My View

 

 

dow of sorts (the chimney

would have been a last resort)
and lobbed in three bags of gold.
No one could say where the
mysterious dowries came
from; but the girls were not
slow to use them. It was observ-
ed that the Bishop looked rather
thinner when he rose to read the

jectives of the college. They
raised this qtlestion in the
courses and degrees committee
which in turn voted by a large
majority in favor of
recommending that a study be
made. The President agreed to
honor this recommdation. He
appointed a committee chaired
by Dr. Wise who was selected
by President Wilson because of
his reputation for fair and un-
biased judgment. The commit-
tee is composed of students as
well as faculty members; it is
not a biased committee; and it
is currently making an honest
effort to evaluate the present
calendar and other options to it.

President Wilson has also
been criticized for expressing
some unfavorable opinions
about the operation of frater-
nities on the campus. He came
here without bias toward frater-
nities. He has simply stated in

Gospel at their wedding. And no
wonder; for the gold was his
allowance, and by giving it
away he had shot his household
budget for the year.

This sort of behavior is com-
monplace among saints. Just
one hundred years before, the
archdeacon of Rome, Law-
rence, had been martyred by
the tax collectors. They were
confiscating the property of the
Church, and demanded
Lawrence surrender’ the
treasury of the Roman see. But
that had already been li-
quidated. Not for fear of
Caesar. Rather, it had been con-
verted into cash and given to
the poor of the city. It was these
humble folk whom Lawrence
rounded up and brought before
the authorities. ‘These,’ he
smiled, ‘are the treasures of the
Church.” They beheaded him
for it, of course.

These saints are but two in

the millions of the noble army of
martyrs, some famed through-
out all lands, some known but to
God. They lived as they died
and died as they did according
to the example of their Master,
Christ Jesus, who, though in-
finite God, took on finited and
mortality, became mere man
for the express purpose of being
executed by torture; dying only
to rise again and blaze for all
other mere men a trail into
Heaven. These saints, in im-
itating Him, lived and died for
others.

That is what is wrong with the
falsifying of St. Nicholas’
character, with the profaning of
the glad Feast of the Incarna-
tion. The loud cry of “I want, I
want, gimme, gimme” drowns
out the choirs angelic. The
season has become a high
Saturnalia of greed.

This sort of self-centeredness
has gotten us in an awful mess.

The sounds of Christmas this
year — and not for the first time
— will be the crying of starving
children; the screams of in-
ternees in the Gulag; the sick-
ening shock of mortar fire. All
this because the Gospel has not
been preached in half the world
and has been twisted or discard-
ed in the other half. Things were
less barbarous in St. Nicholas’
day.

But hope dies not, though it
may sleep for a season. All
things which the world now
needs could be accomplished by
the abandonment of our slavery
to self. This is a season for giv-
ing to others. Let us begin doing
so, now. I am assured that
miracles would follow in the
wake of that commitment;
miracles like Peace and Justice
and the Joy of God. I hope you,
each of you, enjoy such mercies
this Christmas. God rest ye
merry. Amen.

 

he thinks that fraternities can
be improved, and he has inden-
tified some changes that he
thinks could lead to that im-
provement. He has no concern
about fraternities that is not
shared by many members of
the faculty, by many alumni
who were active members of
fraternities, and by - many
parents. The hope is that these
concerns will prompt a self ex-
amination and improvements
that will come from within the
fraternities themselves. There
are already some indications
that this is happening.

By far the most important
question facing us is coeduca-
tion. No change could have such
far-reaching consequences for
the college as this one. Presi-
dent Wilson did not bring this
question to Washington & Lee,
nor has he advocated a course

of action. The question has been
with us for more than a decade,
but the delimma it poses for us
has not been as clear in the past
as it is now becoming. Based on
the data now available to us, the
dilemma appears to be that we
must chose between maintain-
ing the high academic quality of
the college or preserving the
single-sex character of the stu-

dent body. If this is correct,
W&L will certainly change in
the future regardless of which
course of action is ultimately
selected.

Our Board of Trustees will
make that decision. They will
listen to what we, the faculty,
the students, the alumni, have

. to say. They will be impressed

by sound, well-reasoned argu-
ments. I suspect they will reject
frivolous and _ histrionic
arguments.

The debate is important; the
potential changes deserve our
most careful consideration. But
we must be careful in the pro-
cess to maintain another of our
most cherished traditions —
that of mutual respect among
the students, the faculty, and
the administration. We are for-
tunate indeed to have a Presi-
dent who is open, candid, and
honest in his discussions with
us. Few schools are so lucky. By
asking tough questions and by
giving us his unprejudiced
views he is a catalyst for our
self-examination. He is in a
sense holding a mirror up for us
to look into, but he is not respon-
sible for the problems we face
or the flaws we see.

Funding studied for
possible pavilion

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The Executive Committee
may recommend to Stewart
Epley, university treasurer,
that the student activities fee be
increased to $100 next year.

The increase from this year’s
$70 fee would include a $5 fee so
the EC would have more funds
to distribute among the clubs
and $25 for a proposed pavilion
or pavilion-like structure.

A final recommendation by
the EC will be made next
month, President Bob Jenevein
told members during the EC’s
regular meeting Monday night.

In other action, the EC voted
not to pay for members of the
International Club to attend a
Mock United Nations in New
York and tabled action on the
continued existence of the
Political Review.

 

Reminder

A reminder about the class
schedule for the first week of
classes of the winter semester :

Classes begin on Tuesday,
Jan. 3.

Monday classes will meet on
Tuesday (Jan. 3). Tuesday
classes will meet on Wednes-
day; Wednesday classes on
Thursday; Thursday classes on
Friday; and, Friday classes on
Saturday.

 

 

President John Wilson, who’s
‘‘behind it and thinks it’s a good
idea,’’ according to Jenevein,
said the funds could be found.
Jenevein, however, said he told
Wilson ‘‘that I didn’t think that
would be a good precedent to
establish.’’

Other members of the com-
mittee said expenses for four
people to travel to New York
should not come out of student
taxes.

“T myself would be upset, let
alone the people who are paying
the taxes,” junior represen-
tative Darby Brower said.

Other students pay their own
way to conferences and conven-
tions, several members of the
committee noted.

“T’d rather have the commit-
tees banging on President
Wilson’s door than coming to
us,’’ Vice President Dave Judge
said.

Brower’s motion to leave
such funding up to Wilson’s
jurisdiction but to write him a
letter explaining the possible
precedent-setting problems of
his funding the trip passed
unanimously.

After only receiving $850 of its
requested $1,900 during budget
hearings, the Political Review
was told it might receive money
for a second issue if the first
were good.

Editor Mike Singer reported
Monday that the first issue only
cost $600 and requested $500 to
produce a second.

“Well...that’s nice...But I
think we ran out of money the
first time through,” upperclass
law representative Jim Green
responded.

“I think the Political Review
is really outstanding, especially
compared to last year’s
Political Review,” Jenevein
said.

Action on whether to grant .

the Political Review additional
funds was tabled until the EC’s
next meeting, Jan. 9, at which
time Judge will report on the
EC’s funding status.

The EC also tabled action on
whether to release a statement
supporting President Wilson,
who has come under much
criticism because such issues
as coeducation, spring term and
fraternities have again surfac-
ed.

“Personally, I’m sure that
John D. Wilson is thinking about
what is best for the school,”
Jenevein said. “I think it’s in
the best interests of W&L to
boost him and make people
realize he’s a good man.”’

Debate centered around
whether to release a statement
prepared by Green which de-
scribed Wilson as ‘...warm-
hearted...a gifted and conscien-
tious administrator.

“We applaud John D. Wilson
as President of this Universi-
e

Another, prepared by Jene-
vein, asked students to consider
Wilson’s academic and ad-
ministrative record and not to
let rumor affect their percep-
tion of him.

Action on the statements was
postponed until after Christmas
vacation.

 

 

With Your

The EC also heard budget
reports from:

—Contact, which spent $2,000
on John Stockwell and is in-
vestigating the possibility of
splitting expenses for a political
speaker with the Mock Conven-
tion.

—The Rugby Club, which
spent $390 during its fall season,

which it finished with a 3-5-1
record.

—The Ariel, which will
publish its first issue in
February.

The Student Bar Association
failed to appear to answer ques-
tions about its report, so the
SBA was rescheduled for Jan.
16.

 

College rating no
surprise to Wilson

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee Presi-
dent John D. Wilson said this
week that. he ‘‘wasn’t entirely
surprised” at W&L’s recent
first-place showing in a ranking
of smaller comprehensive
universities east of the
Mississippi River.

The list resulted from a
survey by U.S. News & World
Report of college presidents
whose institutions are in that
category.

“I would have been disap-
pointed if we weren’t ranked,”’
Wilson said.

He continued that ‘‘because of
the Law School, we were put in
this peculiar category, whereas
normally we would be thought
of as a ‘national liberal arts col-

 

lege.’ This threw us into a
curious bunch.”’

Wilson ranked the schools
much as they appeared in the
magazine. He put Washington
and Lee first, followed by Union
College, Lafayette College, Get-
tysburg College, and St.
Lawrence University.

He said he ranked W&L first
“without self-serving motives. I
really felt that way.”

Virginia Military Institute
was in the same category as
W&L. ‘I don’t think of VMI as a
comprehensive university,”’
Wilson said. ‘‘I think of VMI as
a military institution with a
unique character and style. I
found it impossible to rank.”’

Of W&L’s finish in the poll,
Wilson said, ‘‘It can’t but help
us. It’s good to be number one.”’

 

Traditional service
tonight atR.E. Lee

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s traditional Christmas
Candlelight Service will be held
Thursday, Dec. 8, at 7:30 p.m.
in the Robert E. Lee Memorial

mas time. The series of lessons
tells the story of sacred history
from the Creation to the Incar-
nation.

The carols and the lessons

will be performed by various
students of Washington and Lee
University, Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College and several
members of the W&L commun-
ity. The X-Cerpts of Hollins Col-
lege will give a special perfor-
mance of ‘‘Zion hort die
Wachtersingen” by J.S. Bach.
Dr. David W. Sprunt, university
chaplain, will give the invoca-
tion and benediction.

Service music will be provid-
ed by organist Warren Taylor.

faculty what had happened dur-
ing Thursday’s University
Council meeting, when no ac-
tion was taken on the matter.

After that, though, Atwood
said, ‘‘There wasn’t much
discussion.

“What is there to discuss?”’

The plus-minus system,
which will add .33 points to a
grade for a plus and subtract .33
points for a minus, was approv-
ed by the University Council
and the faculty in April, 1982.

A compromise approved dur-
ing the UC meeting Thursday
stipulates that the UC would
suggest that the committee on
courses and degrees consider
allowing a student to graduate
if he would fail to achieve the
minimum grade point average
because of the plus-minus sys-
tem.

That proposal received
unanimous approval from the
20 UC members present. A
straw vote on whether this
should apply to just seniors or to
all three classes showed 17
members favoring seniors and
three, including Jenevein,
favoring all three classes.

During the UC meeting, Jene-
vein argued the students’ case
on the plus-minus by pointing
out the problems that might
arise with graduation re-
quirements and the inequities of
having the system affect all
classes simultaneously.

“The faculty is changing the
rules in the middle of the
game,” Jenevein said. ‘“‘two
students could get the same
grade numerically in the same
course (in different years), and
one would get a better or worse
grade.”

Atwood noted though that
having the system only affect
freshmen would require pro-
fessors to give two students in
the same class different grades.
“You’re asking me to give a
sophomore a higher grade than
a freshman?” he said.

Dean John questioned
whether the system should be

 

changed so late in the semester.
“Is it also fair to change the
rules in the middle of the game
because we started off this term
with the plus-minus system?”’
he asked.

Two student members to the
UC spoke out in favor of the
plus-minus system.

“‘T think a lot of students are
missing the boat,’’ senior UC
representative Paul Ziebert
said. ‘It’s up to us to get the
grades. The students can get
the plus if they put the time into
the class. It’s imperative to
keep in mind that we knew
about this at the beginning of
the year.”

Sophomore representative
Steve Losquadro said he agreed
with Ziebert. ‘‘I feel this helps
the hard-working student,” he
added. “It gives graduate
schools a more accurate
representation of the work a
student can do.”

Jenevein noted, though, that
the issue was not the value of

the plus-minus system but

rather whether the system

-should affect upperclassmen or

should be phased into effect.

Dr. Harlan Beckley originally
made the motion about the
graduation requirements, and
Jenevein seconded it, saying ‘‘I
think the students would be
more anpeased if the faculty
were to agree to look into the
nature of a graduate can-
didate’s performance to see if
his eligibility is affected by the
new grading system.

“T think that would answer a
lot of the problems the students
have with this.”’

After passage of that com-
promise and the straw vote on
whether just seniors should be
given special consideration, the
meeting was adjourned without
any action being taken on
whether plus-minus should af-
fect upperclassmen.

Jenevein said afterward that
he’d considered making a mo-
tion to that effect for the record
but decided there was no point
init.

City seeks to annex
more county land

The city of Lexington and
Rockbridge County clashed
Monday afternoon over the ci-
ty’s proposal to annex part of
the county.

The city, which presently
spans 2.48 miles, wants to more
than triple its size by annexing
another 6.86 square miles. City
officials say that there is a need
for the expansion because the
city tax base is shrinking while
the county tax base is growing.
The proposed annexation would
boost the city’s population,
which is presently 7,292, by
about 880 people.

Because the annexation
would undoubtably raise their
taxes, Rockbridge County mer-
chants, citizens and officials
are fighting the proposal.

The city is anticipating a
significant boost in their sales
tax income, which has dropped
about 16 percent in 11 years, by
absorbing some _ profitable
businesses in the county which
include Kroger, Rose’s, SuperX
Drugs, Sears, the Holiday Inn,
Woody Chevrolet, Long John
Silver’s Seafood Shoppe and the
Keydet-General Motel.

Read says drug grand
jury working hard

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A special grand jury in-
vestigating drug trafficking and
dealing in Lexington and Rock-
bridge County has already
generated over 1,000 pages of
testimony, according to Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. ‘‘John’”’ Read.

The grand jury, which was
formed shortly before the elec-
tions last month, was prompted
by a recent rash of drug-related
arrests and convictions, some
involving Washington and Lee
students.

The grand jury, which is
‘meeting every week, is taking
‘“‘an enormous amount of time,”
both in actual hearings and
“preparation of witnesses,”
Read said. Read said he could
not speculate whether or not the

ments or further action.

Robin Sensabaugh, a Lex-
ington man convicted as part of
the drug crackdown, has ap-
pealed his conviction because,
his lawyers say, the jury for the
trial, and the jury pool for
Rockbridge in general, did not
properly reflect the population
of the county. Current laws pro-
hibit most students at W&L and
VMI from serving on juries, and
Sensabaugh’s attorneys argue
this is unfair because students
make up a significant part of
the population.

Read said the appeal was
‘without merit’ because there
is ‘‘no basis for it.’’ He said he
did not expect the appeal to be

would not result in any changes

Death of sixties mourned in “The Big Chill’

Characters cling to their motivations through 20 years of change

By EDDIE CURRAN
Special to the Phi

In an article from “Rolling
Stone” magazine (Sept., 1982)
concerning the ‘60s genera-
tion,’’ Marcelle Clements
wrote, “Trying to recall the
spirit of a certain epoch is often
like describing a dream: it’s
easy to chronicle the events, but
almost impossible to charac-
terize the motivations.’’
Lawrence Kasdan’s new movie
The Big Chill examines the
motivations of the 60s genera-
tion — the impassioned
idealism, the anti-war move-
ment, the long hair — by
mourning their passing. The
characters in The Big Chill are
in their thirties, and have, at
least superficially, conformed
to society’s ways; and yet in
their college days at Michigan,
they were the radical students
who are, to us, the ‘‘60s genera-

 

tion.” College students of today,
who at the time were out play-
ing in the backyard, are as far
removed from our 60s prede-
cessors as from any other
previous generation — to us,
they’re just another slice of
Americana, pictured in Life
magazine compilations next to
50s motorcycle gangs and
marathon dancers from the 40s.
They were the ones who march-
ed on Washington and put
flowers in the rifles of the Na-
tional Guard, who grew their
hair long and first smoked pot,
who swore they’d never vote,
and who burned their draft
cards.

Yet the movie takes place in.

1983, and the 60s generation is
no longer isolated by their
politics or their appearance.
For a symbol, take Jerry
Ruben, who’s now on Wall
Street. Did they sell out? Did
they bite off more than they

could chew? Do their parents
say, ‘‘See how stupid you looked
back then” or ask ‘Did you get
that out of your system?”

Such is the emotional back-
drop of ‘‘The Big Chill.’’ Seven
college friends from the late
sixties reunite at the funeral of

away a promising career for
“the movement.’ As he was the
catalyst of their rebellious ac-
tivities, his death forces them to
come to grips with the motiva-
tions of their college days —
have they sold out, or are they
simply doing the best they can?

The entire movie takes place
in one weekend in South
Carolina and, lest I forget, is a
comedy. It is also one of the
most enjoyable movies of the
year for several reasons. First,

it was simply a good idea to cast
an all-star team of the hottest, .

most talented actors and ac-
tresses in the around-30 age set.
Among those present are
William Hurt (Altered States,
Body Heat), Kevin Kline
(Sophie’s Choice), Mary Kay
Place (Poltergeist), Marilu
Henner (Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman), and Glen Close
(Garp’s mother). Secondly, the
soundtrack is vintage late 60s-
early 70s, with the Stones,

Smokey Robinson, Creedence.

Clearwater, Procul Harem, and
many other great groups from
the represented period. With all
this going for it, I was a little
suspicious that maybe they
might’ve written the script to
The Big Chill after they got the
cast and the soundtrack
together. But there is no
evidence of this in the movie
—the dialogue is crisp, where it
could have been pretentious. In
one scene they have all
gathered and get on the subject
of what they could have done to
prevent Alex’s suicide. As each
is articulate, they sort of take
turns theorizing on Alex, who
had lost touch with most of
them since college. Instead of
seeming like preconceived pro-
fundity, the moviegoer gets a
feeling of sitting in the same liv-
ing room with them, moving his
head in each direction as if at a
tennis match. Each character’s
speech seems to hold some form
of self-revelation and explana-
tion, the kind of excited, even
rambling rhetoric of sensitivity
that one would imagine coming
from these types of characters.
From the dialogue, we learn
something about each charac-
ter: William Hurt’s hardened
cynicism, or Glenn Close’s
guilt-tinged grief, (I use the
names of the actors, for it would
be too confusing to use their
character’s names. )

The two most memorable
characters were those of Hurt’s
and Jeff Goldblum’s. Hurt’s

character was the big stud in
college, then rendered impotent
by a war injury in Vietnam. He
reacts by anesthetizing himself
with drugs and cynicism, re-
taining the anti-societal pose of
the 60s but for all the wrong
reasons. He is kept alive by his
sense of humor and toughness,
and by movie’s end, he is the
one character who has precep-
tably grown from the weekend.
He gets together with Alex’s
young girlfriend, played by Meg
Tilly. She needs a father figure,
he needs to re-establish his
manhood, but even more than
that, he needs love. Their
uniting satisfies the moviegoer,
as Hurt is the most sympathetic
of the characters, and his sense
of a new beginning gives the
film a touchstone on which to
end.

Jeff Goldblum’s character
provides the comic highlights of
the movie, Goldblum appeared
several years ago in a short-
lived but critically acclaimed
TV detective show with Ben
Vereen. I imagine he’ll be seen
more in the future. His
character here is a reporter for
People magazine whose philos-
ophy is that all human behavior
is ultimately motivated by the
desire to get laid. He is a
pleasure seeker pure and sim-
ple, and is the first to expound
on his own lack of principles. In
one scene William Hurt offers
him a Quaalude, and he takes it,
what the hell. A little while later
we get a shot of him knocked out
on the couch, his mouth wide
open and his arm on the floor.
He has that rare face which is
funny on its own, and this is one
of the funniest scenes in any
movie this year.

While The Big Chill is a com-
dey, the sense of loss brought on
by Alex’s death is everpresent.
The movie succeeds because it
develops the feelings of its
characters and the changes in
their motivations since the 60s
in the context of this sense of
loss and self doubt. Their senses
of purpose now have a small
scope — instead of saving the
world, they have come to terms
with raising kids, developing
relationships — whatever it is
that they can do to make their
own lives fulfilling and pur-
poseful. And most importantly,
they have kept their sense of
humor. In the same article in
“Rolling Stone,’’ Clements
wrote this about her peers from
the 60s, and it applies to the
characters in The Big Chill
‘But they still had in common a
strange, enticing quality that I
can only describe as the quality
to disturb. This can be
manifested in subtle ways: in
the midst of a conversation, in
the course of the casual en-
counter, there is the sudden
bold remark, the audacious
twist. You look into these peo-
ple’s eyes and you think, ‘This

- person’s capable of anything.’.”’

X-mas album picks

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Rolling Stones - “‘Under-

cover”’

The Stones at their best since
“Some Girls.” The Glimmer
Twins rail about their favorite
subjects — sex, violence and the
male ego.

Bob Dylan - ‘‘Infidels”’
The album is supposedly
Dylan’s comeback and does not
contain religious material like
“Shot of Love.” Reviews have
been very favorable. Produc-
tion and guitar is credited to
Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.

Yes - “90125”

“Lonely Heart” is a great
single and the album is also
good. The original members of
the band are together except
Rick Wakeman and _ Steve
Howe. Although the single is dif-
ferent from any previous Yes
songs, the album is not. I don’t
know whether that’s a plus or a
minus.

Culture Club - ‘Colour by
Numbers’”’

Although many people hate
Boy George’s appearance, they
should listen to his music. Boy
George has a fine rhythm and
blues voice and the songs center
around this feature. The album
is a mix of reggae, soul, pop and
rhythm & blues. A very
listenable record.

Graham Parker - “The

Real McCaw”’

Reviewers praise this album
as the best record he’s made in
a long time, possibly since his
days with Rumour. The album
reflects his recent happiness
over his new marriage.

_ Invasion,

Big Country - “The
Crossing”
This band is probably the best

to come out of the recent British
excepting Culture
Club. The sound is a resurrec-
tion of the sixties’ emphasis on
guitars (thank god no syn-
thesizers). The musicians write
well and have performed as
studio musicians on Pete
Townshend’s solo albums.

Paul Simon - ‘‘Hearts and

Bones”’

The album started off as a
Simon & Garfunkel collabora-
tion inspired by their popular
reunion over the summer. But
it’s just as well that it remained
a Simon album because it is wit-
ty and mellow.

Billy Joel - ‘An Innocent

Man’”’

One of Joel’s Many genre
albums. (Sometimes I believe
he will outdo Linda Ronstadt.)
This one is a throwback to the
fifties. If you don’t buy this
album at least watch the video
for “Uptown Girl” with Christie
Brinkley. Joel’s next album is
due over Christmas as well.

U2 - ‘‘Live Under a Blood.

Red Sky”’

The best band ever to come
from Scotland, U2 is probably
the hottest band around. The
album. features live versions of
“I Will Follow,” ‘New Year’s
Day” and “Gloria.” I also
recommend that if you like U2,
make sure you purchase
“Boy,” anearlier album.

Michael

‘“‘Thriller’’
What can be said about this
album? It has sold 10 million

Jackson. -

copies (second to Fleetwood
Mac’s ‘‘Rumours”’) and has had
five top ten singles (the Beatles
only had seven from more than
one album). The man is a
genius and this ablum is
definitely a must for anyone
who likes music. If he would on-
ly stop singing duets with Paul
McCartney.

The Police -

chronicity”

Probably the Police’s most
commercial work and its No. 1
Status has proved this. It is also
interesting for Sting’s latest
view of the world and contains a
more assured sound than in the
past. The best cut is
Synchronicity II.

Linda Ronstadt - ‘“‘What’s

New”’

The album is a collection of
old tunes such as “I’ve Got a’
Crush On You” and “Watch
over Me.” The orchestra is led
by Nelson Riddle, famous for
his work on Frank Sinatra’s
records. The album is a great
gift for your mom or dad. It is
perfect to relax by.

Talking Heads - ‘‘Speak-
ing In Tongues”’

An album that has done well
because of its African rhythms
and funky backbeats. Also it is
the first ‘Talking Heads”
album anyone could unders-
tand.

*‘Syn-

James Ingram - “It’s

Your Night”’

Probably an unknown name
to most people, except Quincy
Jones’ fans. Ingram is an im-
mense talent, His vocals grace
such songs as “Just Once,”’ “100
Ways,”’ “Baby Come to Me,”

‘All the Right Moves’
has perfect formula

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Staff Reporter

If there was ever a movie
destined to make money hand
over fist, “All the Right Moves”
Should be considered. Script
writer Micheal Kane comes up
with the perfect formula. The
ingredients: a little sex, a little
high school football, a lot of
Stefan Djordjevic (Tom
Cruise), a teenage pregnancy,

liberal amounts of poverty, a
little more Tom Cruise and a
plot that leaves no high school
melodrama uncovered. In the
war for box office receipts, “All
the Right Moves” has the
(Cruise) missiles in its corner.

The movie itself is stylishly
done. The cinematography is
excellent, especially in showing
the decaying mill town of Am-
pipe, Pa., in all its Steel-gray
glory. The football footage is
true to life, although I tired of
viewing it through the monsoon
that seemed to hover over the
rural Pennsylvania football
fields.

Cruise, as well as the rest of
the football characters, did
creditable acting jobs. The best
acting involved the coach
(Craig T. Nelson), who is half

' drill sergeant, half psycho with

the kind of personality that
anybody vaguely associated
with aspiring coaches could
relate to.

Stefan’s girl, Lisa (Lea
Thompson) is fairly convincing
in her role as the future grocery
checker with the heart of gold.
Their syrupy romance left the
girls in the audience swooning
and the boys squeamish. Her
ability to stop Stefan’s back
seat spelunking at mid-thigh is
particularly praiseworthy. The
final sex scene between Stef and
she, however, is tepid at best.

The final analysis shows that
a perfectly predictable plot
leaves one perfectly bored, but I
feel obligated to tread lightly on
such All-American fare. So go
see the movie after you flag that

you were back in Ampipe with
Stefan and the boys.

Letters to the Editors

Student questions application of drug rule

To the Editors:

Since I last wrote on the
Honor System, my interest has
been aroused twice. The first
time occurred last Spring dur-
ing an Honor case. I will not, in-
deed, cannot, go into details.
The important aspect is this: A
student had been accused of
cheating, based on fairly con-
clusive evidence. The evidence
had been obtained from the ac-
cused by his accuser without
the owner’s knowledge — in
other words, stolen. Can
evidence that has been stolen be
admitted as evidence in an
Honor trial? This particular
question of the case was never
raised by either side.

The question obviously cuts
deeper into the Honor System
than it would in cases of illegal-
ly obtained evidence in court.
Since the question never came
up during the trial, an assump-
tion must be made that the E.C.
either failed to see it or con-
sidered it irrelevant.

The second case is more re-
cent. The E.C. has determined
that honor violations now in-
clude ‘lying, cheating, stealing,
& dealing.’ I do not want to ex-
plore or defend the morality of
drug dealing. Instead, I would
like to look closely at this par-
ticular decision in regard to the
entire system, and then draw
conclusions that I hope will con-
tain some amount of logic. Here
are the arguments:

Alcohol is a drug which can be
distributed illegally, as most of
us are aware. Many freshmen
are 18, therefore underage.
Distribution of alcohol to these
freshmen is illegal, as Don Jef-
frey noted last week. Thus do-
ing so implies dealing in illegal
drugs. (Need I point out possi-
ble ends derived from grain and
mixed drinks? ) Watch out, well-
meaning dorm counselors, frat
brothers, and overage friends!
When you are discovered mak-
ing a beer run, you are dishon-
orable. Likewise I suspect, by
precedent, that fraternity

presidents are held responsible
for underage drinking at par-
ties. Perhaps the E.C. might
clarify this.

One effect of this system of
honor will be an increase of
care taken by any active dealer
in drugs — or alcohol. Unfor-
tunately or fortunately, depend-
ing on your point of view, those
most likely to know who to turn
in — users — are unlikely to do
so. This will mean ignoring the
Honor System by whatever
percentage of our student body
uses illegal drugs or drinks
while under 18 for beer (21 for
everything else). This can hard-
ly benefit the system. Instead, it
must weaken the system by
burdening it with an amend-
ment as unenforceable as Pro-
hibition.

I am not sure the E.C. ex-
amined these chains of thought
before they made their deci-
sion. The ruling seems rash in
many ways. I am reminded of
the ‘‘Budget Amendment” that
appeared in Congress a year or
so ago. It was defeated because
Congress knew the difference
between everyday nitty-gritty
politics and legislation worthy
of adding to the great docu-
ment. The issue here likewise
seems blown out of proportion
when one realizes that murder,
unaggravated assault and rape
are now okay with the honor
system. With the definition of
one specific crime outside ‘ly-
ing, cheating and stealing’
comes the necessity of defining
all others as well. Why have
murder and rape, among
others, been omitted? All in all,
the hurried, rough feeling of
this addition points to unfor-
tunate motives.

There is still another chain of
ideas. When we all entered
W&L, the Honor System did not
include dealing. In fact, we all
signed cards to the effect that
we understood this and had
waded through a brief book on
the subject. Last week, the E.C.
polled us on the plus-minus
system. They found out that an

overwhelming majority of us
believe that we ought to play by
the rules of the catalogue we
entered under. If we apply this
same belief to the Honor
System, we find none of us
should be affected by this
change either. But this time in-
stead of affecting the faculty,
who ignored the survey, it af-

fects the E.C., who commission-

To the Editors:
I suppose that we shouldn’t be

theory is making the rounds
these days, in the Phi and
elsewhere. If people feel
threatened from two or more
directions, clearly there’s a plot
and a man behind it all — some
Dark Lord or “Star Wars’
Emperor, waiting malevolently
in the shadows. To lay any
scrutiny of our little com-
monwealth — whether it be a
single-sex admissions policy,
certain aspects of fraternity
life, or the Spring Term — at the
doorstep of Washington Hall is
the easy way to dismiss it, to ob-
viate the need for careful
gathering of facts or responsi-
ble analysis.

Take Mr. Scott Mason’s col-
umn last week. The Spring
term, we are told, is the ‘“‘most
recent target” of John Wilson
the Boxer, who’s given to “hurl-
ing blows’’ at issues and at
students. This allegation that
President Wilson has master-
minded the study of the present
calendar is all the more surpris-
ing because Mr. Mason, unlike
some recent inventors of con-
spiracies, was in possession of
some of the relevant facts. He
knew that the Committee on
Courses and Degrees (which, he
neglected to mention, has two
student members) had voted by
a large margin to ask the presi-

might assume that it’s NEXT
year’s freshmen who cannot be

An obvious counterargument
to this is that the change was
publicized in the Phi, as it was.
However, a change in the Honor
System could affect any stu-
dent, so it is essential that every
student must be notified. Since
all of us are not required to read

cient form of communication.

neglected to mention, has two
student members). Does he
really think that a college presi-
dent in his first term would
countermand the request of the
faculty committee entrusted
with curricular matters?

Had he looked further, Mr.
Mason might have discovered
that the resurgence of faculty
interest in re-examining the
calendar followed right on the
heels of the study which has
given us new requirements in
general education. This is to be
expected. In the late 60s, calen-

the self-conscious virtue of a
former editor of a _ college

me that letter writers or colum-

EC rep explains
drug dealing rule

To the Editors:

I could easily understand
Donald Jeffrey’s reasoning
after I read his letter to the
Ring-tum Phi about the E.C.’s
decision on drug dealing, I felt
the necessity to write a letter
and explain my reasoning as I
feel he is very entitled to it.

Lying, cheating, and stealing
are stated in the White Book as
“clear examples of breaches of
the Honor System,” but im-
mediately following is includ-
ed: ‘‘The system applies to any
conduct considered dishonora-
ble by the student generation in-
volved.” The Executive Com-
mittee is comprised of
representatives of that student
generation. We unanimously
felt and truly believed to be
justified in the decision that
drug dealing may be considered
dishonorable. The Honor
System is to create an at-
mosphere of trust on campus

and in the community. As for
that reason, I believed along
with the other members, al-
though I cannot speak for them,
that it was in our jurisdiction.
As Mr. Jeffrey stated in his
letter, ‘...a drug entrepre-
neur... has only proven that he
is ungentlemanly and capable
of committing a very serious
violation of the law.’’
Ungentlemanly. I looked up
“gentleman” in the dictionary,
it said: a person of gentle birth
or status. I looked up ‘‘gentle’’
and found one of the definitions
to read: HONORABLE, DIS-
TINGUISHED; specif: of or
relating to the gentleman. I, as
did the other members, made
the assumption that students
like himself would feel drug

dealers to be ungentlemanly, or.

in a more relative term to the
Honor System — dishonorable.

Cagers cool
Catholic U.

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Writer

Senior forward John Lee
Graves scored his 1000th career
point this week as the Generals
basketball team rolled over
Catholic last night and split two
games in the Ithaca College
Tournament over the weekend,
raising its record to 4-3.

In Warner Center last night
the Generals raised their ODAC
record to 2-0 with an 86-70 vic-
tory over the Cardinals (2-5, 1-2
in ODAC play). At Ithaca the
Generals lost the opener to the
hosts, 70-57, then came back
Sunday night to win the consola-
tion match against Lehman Col-
lege, 68-52.

Graves, in the meantime,

 

went over the 1000 mark with 41
points over the weekend, and
added 29 last night to move into
10th position on the all-time
scoring list with 1058 points. He
was honored with a game ball at
halftime last night to mark his
achievement.

Going into last night’s game,
head coach Verne Canfield’s
major worry concerned Catho-
lic’s style of play. The Cardinals
were averaging 87.1 points per
game, while giving up 89.5 per
game. Catholic’s 70 points last
night equaled the highest total
for a W&L opponent this season.

“We didn’t play the style of
game we wanted to play, and
that hurts,” said Canfield. ‘“‘But

said the coach.

Learning was the key ac-
coplishment in the Ithaca Tour-
nament also, according to Can-

from the floor in the 13-point
loss to Ithaca, a team Canfield
believes could become one
the best in the East. ‘We jus
could not find any consistency
against them,” said Canfield.
“Our offense did not play well,
so we had to change our defen-
sive style, and we couldn’t stay
with them.”

Against Lehman, however,
the Generals shot 63 percent
from the floor and came away
with the win. ‘‘I am obviously
pleased with the way we came
back to win the second game,”’
Canfield said. ‘John Lee, in
particular, played a fantastic
game on both ends of the court.
I’m also very pleased with the
play of Lex Fitzenhagen, who
has been consistently playing

well.”’

Grapplers win big,

fourth at Invitational | |

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
wrestling squad posted two im-
pressive victories and a fourth-
place finish in last weekend’s
W&L Invitational on their way
to a solid start to their 1983-84
season.

Last night the Generals
played host to Hampden-
Sydney. The grapplers drubbed
the Tigers 45-11. Pacing the
Generals on the night were
freshman John Lowe at 142 lbs.,
who worked for a third period
fall, and senior tri-captain Tim
Valliere, who dominated his op-
ponent at 167 and also gained a
pin. Sophomore Larry Anker
earned a victory in a well-
fought 8-7 decision at 150 lbs. In
all, the Generals lost just two
bouts in the ten weight divi-
sions.

The Generals easily out-
pointed Lynchburg, 36-14, last
week in Lynchburg. The team
then returned to Lexington to
host the 10th annual W&L In-
vitational Tournament. The
tournament was won by Divi-
sion I school VMI. (113 3/4
points). Second place belonged
to George Washington (66
points), also a Division I team,
with York (42 1/4 points)
finishing third and Washington
and Lee (36 points) fourth. Get-
tysburg finished
fifth, trailed by Hiram, Scran-
ton and Longwood. The fourth
place showing by the Generals
was their best in the history of

 

The subjects of this bird’s-eye view are Larry Anker and his op-

the tournament.

“That was a_ particularly
tough tournament by design,”
said head coach Gary Franke.
“We wrestled some very good
teams, including Division I VMI
and George Washington, as well
as some excellent Division III
teams. Still, I was very pleased
with the outcome.”

Franke was particularly
pleased with the performance
of two of his wrestlers in the
tournament. ‘‘Veterans Tim
Valliere and Jeff Dixon have
been outstanding. And some of
our younger wrestlers did very
well,” he stated.

Dixon, a junior, won the 190
lb. championship by defeating
Bobby Knarr of VMI in the
final, 5-3. Valliere, a senior cap-
tured second place honors, los-
ing only to VMI’s Steve Green in
the championship round of the
167 lb. class.

Other General grapplers who
performed well in the tourna-
ment were Brian Lifsted (118
lbs.), Jeff Mazza (126 lbs.), Tim
Walker (150 lIbs.); and Joe
O’Neill (177 lbs.).”” All captured
fourth place finishes at the In-
vitational.

fhe W&L wrestlers will
resume action after the holiday
break, when they travel to
Durham, N.C. to square-off
against the Duke University
Blue Devils on Saturday,
January 6. The squad will be
looking to avenge last year’s
loss to the Blue Devils, the
worst defeat ever for the
Generals.

Maurerm, head football coach
at Wittenberg College, chaired
the selection committee for the
division. )

Said the Generals’ tri-
captain, “I made it (All-
America) a goal but I forgot
about it over the years. It was a
real shock last week when
Coach Fallon told me.”’

The six-foot-two, 220-pound
center from Point Pleasant,
N.J., experienced his best year
at Washington and Lee this
year. As a captain, he offered
leadership both on and off the
field. His play was consistently
dominating.

According to head coach
Gary Fallon, ‘Glenn was a real
pleasure to have on our team.
He is an outstanding player who
has consistently improved
himself over the years, and he
is a tremendous leader.

“He is a real man in every
respect. He has earned this
reward — he worked for it —
and I’m extremely pleased to
see him get the recognition that
he deserves.”

Rarely a glamour position,
the center is pivotal in seeing
that the snaps to the quarter-
back, punter, and holder are
conducted smoothly. In addi-
tion, the center is the catalyst
for the offensive line, a key to a
strong running game.

“The success of our running
game and Gene Girard is due to
our offensive line, and Glenn is
certainly an instrumental part
of line,” commented Fallon.

Kirschner returned the
praise: ‘‘I’d like to give alot of
credit to Coach Fallon. He’s the

Senior tri-captain Glenn Kirschner at work in the trenches where
he earned his All-American standing. The center was the only

person who kept me at W&L
when I thought about transfer-
ring because I was sitting on the
bench. Also, the academics
here were tough for me and I
was eight hours away from
home.”

Things have changed now,
though. Kirschner, a _ jour-
nalism major, is applying to

several law schools in the
Boston area, discarding any
idea of going pro.

*‘No, I’m too small. To be pro-
size, I’d have to be 250-260
pounds and my frame will only
allow me to carry 220 pounds. I
think it’s better for me to bow
out with this honor.”

Professor defends Wilson

To the Editors:

I feel compelled to respond to
Scott Mason’s charges that
President Wilson has initiated a
move to abandon our current
12-126 calendar in favor of a 15-
week semester system.

The facts are as follows: Last
year I served as a member of
the Committee on Courses and
Degrees. During the year I
heard various faculty members
criticize the 12-12-46 calendar.
During a Spring meeting of the
Committee a quite different
issue led us into a discussion of
the Spring term. Two members
of the Committee expressed
strong reservations about our
current calendar. Since I had
heard such concerns from
faculty both inside and outside
the Committee and, since the
Committee was obviously going
to be preoccupied for the im-
mediate future with implement-
ing the General Education pro-
posals, I made a motion to
recommend to the President
that he appoint a special com-
mittee to consider the calendar.

That motion passed the Com-
mitee on Courses and Degrees
and President Wilson, quite pro-
perly, responded to the recom-
mendations by appointing the
Calendar Committee.

At no time did I consult with
President Wilson or have any
prior knowledge of his views on
the calendar. | do not know to
this day what he thinks of the
12-124. Moreover, he com-
mented to me during the sum-
mer that he was surprised by
the recommendation since he
had not heard the criticism I
had heard.

I might also volunteer that
my motion did not stem from
any opposition, on my part, to
the 12-12-6 calendar. On the con-
trary, I favor the Spring term
because I believe it has
facilitated the development of
our present very rich and
varied curriculum and I believe
a return to the semester system
would force a reduction in
course offerings which would be
to our detriment in an increas-
ingly competitive market place.

Nevertheless I do also believe it
is appropriate for the faculty to
evaluate the effectiveness of the
calendar periodically, and that
faculty in disciplines which can-
not make effective use of the
Spring term deserve an oppor-
tunity to air their objections and
to search for solutions to their

problems. I hope that the out-
come of this process will be a

Pub board

For a long time there was no
need to dip into the reserve
fund. It just kept growing, col-
lecting dust waiting to be used.
Then came last spring and the
Calyx found itself $5,000 in in
the hole. It took from the
reserve fund which now stands
at about $4,000.

So the surplus cash that had
been rotting away in the till
finally got used after all, and

reaffirmation and, therefore, a
renewed commitment to a
calendar which will offer us the
advantages of the 12-12-46 and
also afford some solution to the
problems which it presents to
some.

I might add that I am not cur-
rently a member of either the

Committee on Courses and

Degrees or the Calendar Com-
mittee, Students who want
some input into the Calendar
Committee may consult.the two
students whom President
Wilson appointed to that Com-
mittee: Messrs. Robert Woods
or Lee Feldman.

what were considered financial-
ly fat organizations don’t seem
fat any more. Still it’ll be in-
teresting to see what happens at
next year’s budget hearing. If
The Ring-tum Phi doesn’t use
all the money the Executive
Committee gave it this year, as
the Phi has had a knack of doing
in the past, it could run into a
jam. Since the Phi isn’t using all
the money it’s been given, the
EC simply might decide to

reduce the amount it usually
gives them. A conflict arises
between ‘‘punishing’’ an
orginization for saving money
by being well-run and being
financially fair to struggling
orginizations and seeing that
they remain alive. If the EC
decides in the future to play
Scrooge and cut back the
paper’s budget, they’re likely to
be some bleak Christmases
ahead for The Ring-tum Phi.

 

 

Trustees ——

(continued from page 1)

Wilson said retiring trustee Jack Warner
has been ‘‘very generous to Washington
and Lee. He’s a man. of extraordinary
education and talent. He’s a man with
strong opinions who has the courage to

state them.”

Warner recently traveled the country on

behalf of W&L’s capital fund.

Frank Brooks, who began his term in.
1972, was, Wilson says, ‘‘a wonderful and
caring member of the Board...He’s as sen-
sitive and as thoughtful a man as one could

expect.

“He speaks with great affection of his
years at W&L, and continues to be of great
service to us by giving his counsel.”
called Sydney Lewis ‘‘a
monumental figure in the history of this
university and of philanthropy. His great
contributions to W&L are matched by his
equally generous gifts to many other social

Wilson

institutions.

‘He is a great, great man and a wonder-
ful friend.’’ Wilson and Lewis once served
together on the board of the Virginia Foun-

dation for the Humanities.

In a recent letter to retiring trustee
Waller Dudley, Wilson said he combines
“great intelligence and experience with

candor.”’

Wilson said he was “‘able to tell you
where you’re going to go wrong, and warn
you of potential difficulties. He is absolute-
ly focused on the well-being of this Univer-

sity.”

When asked if there was a recent exam-
ple of this warning of “potential dif-
ficulties,’ Wilson said, ‘‘He’s certainly
counseled with me on the coeducation
question and how that should be approach-
ed. He has great concern for W&L, and I

trust him implicitly.

“‘He’s mostly concerned with the pro-
cess, and concerned about the impression
of an accelerated timetable and judgment.

I dare not go any further...’’
