VOLUME 83

Former
student
convicted

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Former Washington and Lee
student Marc Ham _ pleaded
guilty on Monday in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court to posses-
sion of cocaine and sale of co-
caine and was placed in jail
pending the completion of a
presentence report.

Special Agent Wayne Oyler of
the Virginia State Police
testified Monday that last April
16, an informant bought one
ounce of cocaine from Ham.
The informant was identified in
court as Charles Phillips, a
W&L student at the time who
had been arrested previously on
drug charges.

Later that same day, Oyler
obtained a search warrant for
Ham’s room and confiscated
three more ounces of cocaine as
well as a hacksaw blade, a
razor blade, a spoon and other
items associated with the use or
preparation of cocaine.

Oyler testified that in 14 years
he had never seen cocaine as
pure as that confiscated from
Ham. The purity varied from 83
percent to 99 percent.

Oyler was hesitant about
placing a street value on the
drug but estimated that it could
sell for as much as $4,000 to
$5,000 per ounce.

Oyler testified that Ham had
been selling cocaine since his
freshman year at W&L and had
furnished the names of eight to
16 other students to the police.

Ham’s attorney requested
that Ham be placed in Rock-
bridge County jail pending the
presentence report so that he
might ‘‘get some time under his
belt.” Ham began serving time
in jail on Monday afternoon.

A presentence report is
designed to give the judge at the
sentencing a more thorough
knowledge of the defendant’s
background in the hope that the
sentence will be more fitting
and fair.

Prosecutor wants jail sentences for W&L students

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

There will be little trouble with
drug dealing on the Washington
and Lee campus in the future,
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C. ‘John’ Read said in
an interview last week.

“I’m not so naive to believe
that this will be the end of the
use of marijuana and cocaine at
W&L. And I certainly don’t con-
done it. But I really hope
that the message has gotten
through that you cannot sell
marijuana and cocaine and get
away with it,”’ Read said.

Read said that he will ask for
jail sentences in the cases of
two W&L students, Thomas J.

Rohrig and William L. Deder-
ick, who recently were con-
victed on drug charges. Read
emphasized that this would
mean that the two men would
serve up to 12 months in-the
Rockbridge County Jail.

“I would hate to send them to
prison. Prison can be a very
brutal place for a young male,”’
Read said.

Read, 39, said that so far
Rohrig and Dederick have been
cooperative in assisting in the
ongoing investigations of drug
dealing at W&L, Virginia
Military Institute and in the
community. The purpose of
these investigations is to catch
dealers who were above
Dederick and Rohrig on the
drug selling pyramid, Read
said.

Read said that in the case of
large scale dealers he would
ask for prison sentences.

‘“‘The more a person sells and
where he is on the pyramid of
selling determines what kind of
sentence he will get,’ said
Read.

Read added that he felt a
tremendous amount of compas-
sion for the families and friends
of Rohrig and Dederick. Read
said that he thought it was un-
fortunate that they got involved
in selling drugs.

To fight marijuana and co-
caine use in the community in
the future, Read said that he
supports the purchase of a drug
detecting dog for the communi-
ty at a cost of $8000.

“These dogs are immensely
effective,’ said Read. ‘‘Utiliza-

Experiment
backfires
on students

By TED LECLERQ
Staff Reporter

As Eddie Murphy and Dan
Ackroyd were the victims of a
sociology experiment in their
summer hit movie, ‘Trading
Places,” so was the Washington
and Lee community fooled last
spring.

Although Murphy and Ack-
royd’s movie has been well
publicized, little has been said
about the experiments of stu-
dents in Assistant Professor
David Novack’s sociological de-
viance class last spring.
According to Professor Novack,
all but two of the experiments
achieved acceptable results.

The two experiments from
Sociology 270 that did not go
over quietly were the projects
of then juniors Ben St. Clair and
Todd Howe.

St. Clair’s experiment was

chances of success of a drug in-
vestigation and is an invaluable
tool to local law enforcement
agencies,”’ Read said.

In another matter, Read said
that during his eight years in of-
fice he has stuck to his 1975
campaign promise not to en-
gage in excessive plea bargain-
ing.

“Every single time there has
been a plea agreement the law
enforcement officer involved in
the case and the victim of the
crime have signed the plea
agreement,’’ Read said.

Read said he will only enter
into a plea bargain agreement
when the defendant is alreadv
receiving a prison or jail
sentence, when the defendant

Eller, Welsh comment on abuse em

By GREG AYDT
Special to the Phi

Carl Eller. The name carries
with it a host of memories. A
member of the feared ‘Purple
People Eaters’’ defense of the
Minnesota Vikings, Carl Eller
played in five Pro-Bowls and on
four Super Bowl teams. Yet the
public never saw another side of
Car] Eller, the secret part of his
life that cost him his marriage,
his money and a number of
jobs. Carl Eller was addicted to
alcohol, marijuana and co-
caine.

Today, Carl] Eller is ‘‘clean,’’
and has made for himself a new
life, working for the National
Football League as a consultant
on drug abuse. Last Thursday
night, Carl Eller and Warren
Welsh, Director of NFL Securi-
ty, spoke to a near capacity
crowd in Lee Chapel, on the pro-
blems associated with drug
abuse, especially as they relate
to athletes.

The subject was one of major
interest to the audience, many
of whom were athletes them-
selves, given the recent revela-
tions, by both former and pre-
sent NFL players, of drug abuse
within the league, as well as the
recent suspension of four NFL

players for drug related ac-
tivites. The speakers avoided
the sensationalism of recent
press accounts, choosing in-
stead to present a factual case
which attempted to put the re-
cent incidents in a new light.
Both stressed the fact that drug
use exists in all segments of
society and that the recent
media accounts of recent drug-
related problems in the NFL ex-
aggerate the extent of the drug
use within the league. But
Welsh was quick to add that
“one (drug user) is one too
many.’’ Commenting on the re-
cent press coverage, Welsh
found fault with some of the
more sensational aspects of the
coverage as well as its extent,
but recognized that members of
the NFL “‘live in a fishbowl,”
and that such attention is a part
of the territory.

Both men also stressed that
the biggest drug problem in the
NFL is alcohol, not cocaine.
Eller, in recounting his own
dependence, explained that he,
like many of the players in the
NFL who are “‘chemically de-
pendent,’’ began his odyssey as
a teenager using alcohol, only
gradually moving on to other
drugs while searching for a
steady high. In addition, he

pointed out that many coaches
and league officials didn’t
recognize the problem as what
it was, because they didn’t
know what they were looking at.

Both Eller and Welsh also
took issue with those who would
see players involved with drugs
barred from the league as miss-
ing the point. The NFL views
drug abuse as an illness, ‘“‘and
whatever the (player’s) pro-
blems are, they are viewed as
stemming from that illness.” In
addition, Eller pointed out that
while many players are put ona
pedestal and looked up to as
heroes, this is done by the
public, and “sometimes an
athlete neither wants nor ac-
cepts that responsibility ,’’ mak-
ing it grossly unfair to hold the
athlete to a higher standard of
conduct merely because they
are in the limelight.

On a more positive note, it
was pointed out that because of
the recent publicity about drug
abuse and league involvement
in helping the athletes with drug
problems, drug abuse is de-
creasing within the league.
That’s something you don’t
read too often in the press, but
it’s something everyone who
cares about sports should know,
because ultimately, that’s the
thing that really matters.

He who hesitates is lost...

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

... There’s a saying in sports
that is as applicable to what
happened on Rhode Island
Sound as it is succinct. That
saying, ‘No guts, no glory,” ap-
plies to Australia II skipper
John Bertrand. Liberty’s skip-
per Dennis Conner is probably
still wandering around, wonder-
ing what happened to the race
and Cup that he thought were
his. The simple fact regarding
the seventh race in the
ROC ge «8 cae
Australia’s...Cup was that the
Australians played to win and
Americans a.k.a. Dennis Con-

Liberty led the series 3-1 and
the final race by 57 seconds on
the next to last leg. The question
is how do you lose from that ad-
vantage? What happened to Mr.
Conner was perhaps that he
forgot he could lose, that he
breathed a sigh of relief too
soon. The gutsy fifth leg
maneuver of the Australians
earned them the cup. The com-

Americans earned them the

...Wilson Field was the site of
a football team coming into
their own. The Generals dis-
played near perfection on de-
fense and offense last weekend.

With Gene Girard averaging
seven yards a carry and Bobby
Wilson getting more than 120
yards in total offense a game,
W&L is as offensively strong as
it could hope for. Defensively,
the Generals were able to get
the big play when they needed
it. If the Generals can play this
well at Game Two in the
schedule, imagine where they’ll
be at season’s end...One other

for polo. They’re getting
stronger every weekend, and by
November they should be in top
form for the Southern Cham-

Harriers look strong

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

The 1983 harriers of
Washington and Lee got their
season off to a fast start. The
Generals won a four team meet
here in Lexington last Satur-
day. The Generals took first,
under the fast-paced direction
of Angus McBryde, Frank Pitt-
man and Paul Chapman, fin-
ishing second, third, and fourth,
respectively, with a score of 28.
Mary Washington College plac-
ed second with a count of 40
points. Newport News Appren-
tice School, who incidentally
had the top finisher in the meet,
Martin Nixon, placed third in
overall scoring. Washington
College finished last in team
scoring.

Generals’ coach Dick Miller
commented, ‘‘We ran excep-
tionally well for this early in the
season. I am pleased with

everyone’s performance.”’ Also
scoring for W&L were Eddie
Goundry, who placed ninth and
right behind him was freshman
Ted Myers, finishing the top
five scoring Generals.

Although Coach Miller
believes in the philosophy of
taking one meet at a time, he
and his squad must now concen-
trate on this week’s foes. The
Generals will be joined with
Roanoke College in a tri-squad
meet at Norfolk State Universi-
ty this Saturday, ‘‘We are going
from a tough, hilly course of our
own to a basically flat course at
Norfolk, which could hurt,” ex-
pressed a concerned Miller.

Coach Miller still remains
very optimistic, ‘‘We’re
stronger at this point in the
season than we were last year
(ODAC Champions) and Bob
Glenn will also add to our score
this week.” Glenn was sidelined
last week due to an illness.

Opinion

Anonymity versus the photograph

they saw him during the day (the student is allowed to at-
tend classes but must return to jail at night) they’d be apt
to single him out. What’s more, the critics asked why put
his picture and not the pictures of the other two mentioned
in the article?

Ring-tum Phi chief Editors Rick Swagler and John
Cleghorn hadn’t anticipated the criticism. They acted
automatically in printing the photograph. ‘‘We didn’t even
think about it,”’ Cleghorn said.

Their reason for running the picture, Cleghorn said, was
that ‘“‘It helps the reader to identify the person. On a small
campus like W&L, I guess some people thought that such
identification wasn’t necessary,’ he said.

Even with the criticism, the Phi editors agree that they
were right in printing the photograph. ‘‘I don’t think the
size of the campus should affect the students’ right to
know,” Swagler said. ‘‘We didn’t really see any reason not
uched by the problem of drugs. It, too, has been shocked to run the picture. He was president of his fraternity, a
' the reality that not all W&L men are free from corrup- leader on campus and was the only current student involv-
mn. ed.”

In its first issue, the Ring-tum Phi reported the convic- 5
Readers’ Advocate

accused drug dealer John DeLorean over its pages, and
not a single person probably thought anything about it.

Obviously the Phi is not the Washington Post. Never-
theless, the Phi is a real newspaper, and should therefore
be governed by the same journalistic rules as the Post, the
New York Times or any other major big-city newspaper.

The critics’ main thrust however is that the size of the
campus didn’t justify printing the picture. Because W&L
is a small college, most people probably already knew
who the student was just by seeing the name. By printing
his picture critics said the Phi wasn’t just reporting the
student, it was dragging his name through the mud.

The size of a newspaper or of the city it serves shouldn’t
dictate the journalistic rules that newspaper will follow.
Whether W&L is made up of a hundred people or a hun-
dred-thousand, the Phi should adhere to the same set of
principles.

The student whose picture appeared was convicted of a
felony. He was tried and found guilty. That’s news, and if
a picture of the student adds to the article or helps the
reader visualize the person whom he’s reading about then
it should be run.

Those sympathetic to the convicted student may cry
that the Phi ‘“‘ganged up”’ on him. It may appear to them
that the Phi ganged up. In reality, however, the Phi just

Washington and Lee, with its long history of tradition,

uthern town. Here boys are molded into men as they
\in in knowledge and in etiquette.

But the rosy picture of this majestic university has been
riously flawed, flushing the image of the W&L

Drug use is a highly sensitive topic, a mine that when
uched immediately explodes in controversy, criticism,

The nation has awakened to the extent of the problem

ared on the front page. Along with it ran a picture of one

Criticism of the Phi immediately surfaced. Many stu-
nts were angered, not by the story being printed but at

id, was unnecessary. It served no purpose except to
ace an additional stigma on the convicted student. On a

The line between reporting the news and sensationaliz-

campus it’s barely discernible.

In this case, critics believe the Phi was guilty of cross-

face they’d recognize as ‘‘the W&L gentleman who went

Sit back and cool out

By MARKHAM SHAW PYLE

To most of us, this seems a

trange time of year for the
naking of New Year’s resolu-
ions. But it is a new year, of
‘ourse; and for the Class of
987, a new life. And it is to them
particularly wish to speak.

On a recent Saturday, I took
ome time and went to Goshen,
ust me and my Coors. By great
‘ood fortune, I found what must
ave been the only secluded
tretch of the Maury within 20
niles. I then and there caught
ip with five faithful friends
yhom I had sadly neglected of
ate. Their names are Touch,
‘aste, Sight, Smell and Sound.

It is fatally easy for us in this
nvironment to come down with
cute tunnel vision. The next
risis, the short term outlook,
hat blasted deadline...tonight,
x the next day, or the next
Jass meeting. An _ endless
eries of hurdles, and all close
ogether. We have little time to
90k ahead for miles, to dawdle,
nd to plan. Something always
equires our more immediate
ttention. Even our
musements are locked in to
ome schedule. We party under
he gun.

I say we don’t have time to
ake time, to collect ourselves
nd do some horizon-scanning.
Ve could make time, though, if
ve tried. But we let it be stolen
y triviality, we are busy being
hivvied about by a whole hunt-
ag pack of Heres and Nows,
nd we’re too tired to force a
eather on ourselves.

Now, if there is one place
here this way of life is stark
asensibility, it is this Universi-
y. You are shocked: this is the

land of deadlines. But think; we
concentrate on the test-
measured, the numbers, the
useless, when we think that
way; because we have confused
training with education. W&L
has always finally remembered
that distinction — at least, so
far; may it continue to do so
now. We really know, though we
don’t always act like it, that
classroom learning is barely
the half of education. We know
that the already dated and
remarkably mediocre texts and
technical books of our day are
at best harmlessly irrelevant
and at worst outright lies; and
so we do put the emphasis of
education where it belongs.
Where’s that? It’s in the books
and the beers and the basset
hounds that have stood the test
of time and even survived being
Approved by the Establish-
ment. It’s in Dickens and
Trollope and A.A. Milne; in
Maker’s Mark and spring
water; and at county fairs and
sausage-makings and in the
leaves of autumn. Those are the
things that matter. When we
meet our maker, I seriously
doubt he’ll give a tinker’s dam
about our understanding of the
politics of municipal elections
in East Blowhard.

Now let me say two things. If
you’re taking a course in
municipal elections in the small
town, give it all you’ve got. You
aren’t worth that same tinker’s
dam if you don’t; whether or not
anybody else knows that fact,
you will. And that reeks,
friends. And yes, there are
moral obligations anyone wor-
thy of his salt’ll take seriously ;

but if he’s any good at all, he
won’t take himself seriously in
the process. That’s what I’m
talking about here; com-
prende?

But my advice as a whole is
simple. Read more, but read
cause you want to. If you don’t
like an author but think you
‘ought’ to, bag the project. Lik-
ing an author is as unpredic-
table as falling in love; and
don’t concern yourself with it if
the match seems unsuitable
somehow.

We learn minor matters from
charts and graphs. We get to
know God and the Cosmos and
women and truth and our own
selves through reason, served
by those faithful retainers I took
to Goshen: our senses. Use ’em,
man, use ’em. Have an honest
beer and a roast beef sandwich
for lunch. Play with a
dachshund, and ignore the
chuckles of the elegant, the
sophists, and the refined. (God
knows the dachshund will.) If
you’re down, reread ‘‘Winnie
the Pooh,”’ and avoid like the
plague any work recommended
as ‘important.’ Go to that purest
of sports, the small town high
school football game. Listen to
birds. Smell woodsmoke on a
cold wind. Climb trees. And at
all costs, stop standing in front
of that damned mental mirror
we all have, the one we preen in
front of. Stop worrying about
how you're looking. It took me a
long wicked time to learn that.
Don’t you start.

So, in a phrase: welcome to
the big time. But don’t pay it
any mind. The first and the
great commandment is: Cool

Ethics, rationality

and the arms race

By TOM CONNORS
Special to the Phi

Unfortunately, the word
‘‘prophet”’ is commonly used to-
day to mean ‘‘one who predicts
the future.”’ This, however, is
misleading, for prophets con-
centrate more directly on the
present. The future they see is
one they derive from their view
of what will occur if the evils of
the day are left uncorrected.
Thus, in Dickens’ ‘A Christmas
Carol,” the Ghost of Christmas
Yet to Come, acting as a pro-
phet, forsees a bad end for Tiny
Tim should his situation remain
unchanged. The ghost predicts
the future of the present in a
sense, but it is valid only if the
time’s evils continue unchang-
ed. His prophecy is forceful
enough to change even
Ebenezer Scrooge.

This is the light in which we
must view the upcoming visit of
Bishop Walter Sullivan to Wash-
ington and Lee on Oct. 4, and
the recent Bishops’ Letter on
Nuclear Armaments. The
bishop’s address, ‘‘Peacemak-
ing in a Nuclear Age,” will
discuss the rationality and
ethics of the arms race.

Since 1945, we have delegated
the care of nuclear arms to tem-
poral powers. The result has
been unencouraging: a seem-
ingly unending arms race, the
use of the nuclear balance for
political means (i.e., getting
elected), an extension of the
rhetoric and propaganda of Mc-
Carthyism, and a long series of

meaningless, ineffective pro-
posals to end the race. It is clear
that politicians have little con-
cept of our weapons’ capabili-
ties. The present administra-
tion talks of “limited nuclear
exchanges” and “winning a
nuclear war,”’ as if they knew of
what they spoke. Yet no world
leader of today has ever seen a
nuclear explosion. Those who
have, survivors of Los Alamos
and other test grounds, are
thoroughly frightened and have
come to some kind of terms
with the likelihood of an upcom-
ing doomsday. Our leaders do
not share these feelings. John
Kennedy and Ronald Reagan
were both elected waving the
red flag of the so-called “‘win-
dow of vulnerability’””» —which
in both cases was _ untrue
statesman. Likewise, the arms
reduction proposals have pro-
ven to be equally immature.
The USSR offers only proposals
which would leave itself with
the upper hand. We do precisely
the same.

The bishops, in their letter,
call upon us to begin the long
journey to rid our planet of the
means for its destruction:

“As Americans, citizens of
the nation which was the first to
produce atomic weapons, which
has been the only one to use
them, and which today is
capable of decisively influenc-
ing the course of the nuclear
age, we have grave human,
moral and political respon-
sibilities to see that a ‘conscious
choice’ is made to save humani-
ty.” (continued on page 12)

EC announces studies of

By G. BRUCE POTTER

A decision on coeducation at
Washington and Lee may be

in February, Dave Judge, Ex-

president, said Monday night.

Judge, who represented the
student body at meetings of the
board of directors of the Alumni

coeducation ‘‘is an issue that’s
going to come toa head.”

“They’re really looking at it
seriously,’ Judge said. ‘‘If the

it’ll be made sometime in the
near future.”’

Among aspects of coeduca-
tion considered by the alumni,
Judge said, was the question of
“if we stay single-sex, 10 years
down the road will we have to
drop our academic standards?”

Judge also said that some
long-range plans are being
made regarding student hous-
ing and other university
facilities, and these would be
altered if the university decided
to go coeducational.

class elections are over.

Fraternities at Washington
and Lee also dominated the
alumni meetings, Judge said.

Alumni feel ‘‘the fraternities
are an embarrassment to the
university,” he said. “It’s just
hit rock bottom.’ Suggestions
for improving the system in-
cluded having all officers live in
the fraternity houses and hav-
ing the advisers play more ac-
tive roles.

Judge said that university
President John Wilson will
meet with all fraternity
presidents tonight in Lee
Chapel. The meeting will be
open to other fraternity mem-
bers and the student body.

In other action Monday, the
EC announced that elections for
the first-year law rep will be
held Monday, with run-offs
Thursday.

Elections for freshman class
officers will be Monday, Oct. 10,
with run-offs Thursday, Oct. 13.
Petitions for those elections
must have 50 signatures and
must be submitted to the EC by
7 p.m. Monday, Oct. 3.

Two subcommittees were
formed also Monday. Darby
Brower, junior class rep, and
James White, sophomore rep,
will study the possibility of ad-
ditional lights in the front park-
ing lot. And senior rep George
Youmans and sophomore rep
Ken Lindeman were appointed
to a committee to select win-
ners of the Who’s Who awards.

By MIKE ALLEN

Staff Reporter
A pair of Washington and Lee
students has been given the
identities of two people who
have confessed to assaulting

them on Sept. 18, but as of late
Wednesday the two had not
pressed charges.

Lexington Police Chief
Lawrence O. Sutton released
the names and addresses of two
black male Lexington residents
to junior Ed Buttarazzi and
senior Roger McDonough at a
meeting in his office last Friday
afternoon.

He instructed the students
that in order to institute legal
proceedings, they must visit a
local magistrate and request a
warrant for the arrest of the
confessed attackers, which the
police department would then
serve.

‘“‘This is a criminal charge of
assault which you originate as
victims,’ Sutton told them.
‘“‘The decision whether or not to

prosecute is yours....

“The police department has
gone as far as any department
can to assist you at this noint ”’
he said. ‘‘Now the ball is in your
court.”’

Buttarazzi, who received
bruises and a black eye from
the assailants, said Tuesday
afternoon that no action had
been taken because ‘‘we just
want to see if we want to get in-
volved.”

McDonough, who suffered a
broken nose in the encounter,
cited “schedule conflicts’ be-
tween the two as the reason for
the lack of movement in the
case.

Sutton confirmed that “a
magistrate has not delivered
the warrant.”’

At the Friday meeting, Sutton
told Buttarazzi and McDon-
ough, ‘‘As a result of this in-
vestigation, we have talked
with these individuals, and they

have admitted they were in a
fight with you.”

He added, “I will tell you,
though, that their story of what
happened is different from
yours.”

‘‘What you do is entirely up to
you,” he told them. ‘If you
decide to prosecute, we will go
into court and testify that these

individuals admitted assaulting
you....

‘‘We’re here to help you, and
we will help you. The possible
we do immediately; the im-
possible takes a little longer.”’

Sutton permitted a reporter to
be present during the session.
Investigating officer Steven E.
Crowder was also in atten-
dance. :

“we will assist you in getting
a conviction,’’ Crowder told the
students.

Sutton questioned the stu-
dents briefly to confirm the
police report taken when the in-
cident occurred.

“Correct me if I’m wrong,”
he said. ‘‘You stated that you’d
been drinking too much at the
time.”

“‘We were drinking,’”’” McDon-
ough acknowledged.

“Correct me if I’m wrong,”
Sutton continued. ‘‘At the time,
you said you didn’t have much
interest in prosecuting.”’

“We said we weren't pre-
pared to prosecute,’’
McDonough said.

Buttarazzi added, however,
‘“‘Now we’d both be interested in
prosecuting and seeing a magis-
trate.”

The police report shows that
on Sept. 18, Buttarazzi and
McDonough claimed that their
assailants had been six to eight
in number.

Sutton said in an interview on
Tuesday, however, ‘‘The best
we can determine from the two
(that have been identified),
they were the only ones involv-
ed.

“We have no evidence to sup-
port that there were more than

two involved.”

Sutton would say only that the
two had confessed ‘‘to set the
record straight.”

The police chief said that “‘if
we had arrested at least two of

the people” that the students
had mentioned that night, But-
tarazzi and McDonough ‘‘would
have been charged with false
arrest.

“One of the people they were

Experiment

designed to see how people
would react when he wore band-
ages over his eyes and told
them he could possibly be blind
for life.

Howe’s goal was to see the
response of people when he
married a Hollins girl without
any previous hint of a romance.

Both St. Clair’s and Howe’s
projects involved difficult
ethical questions, all of those in-
volved admitted. Yet, the stu-
dents continued to question,
how does one balance the im-
portant need for data from
human research with the weigh-
ty ethical considerations?

“There are several camps
that people fall into on this
issue,” said Washington and
Lee ethics professor Louis

Hodges. ‘“‘The polar arguments
are that the gain of data out-
weighs the loss of ethics or that
people have an absolute right
not to be deceived.”

Ben St. Clair said he told his

friends last spring what had
happened to him. St. Clair said
he told people that he had gone
home for the weekend to Glas-
gow. He had been helping his
mother work on her rose
garden. While spraying those
roses, St. Clair told his friends,
,a cannister of insecticide had
burst in his face. He then wrap-
ped his face with wide strips of
gauze and told his friends that
he could be permanently blind.
“The goal of the course was to

discover what makes an act de-
viant,”’ St. Clair said. “We tried

to limit it to campus, but it
didn’t work. My sister had peo-
ple coming up to her in Glasgow
and asking about me. My
mother even had a lawyer ap-
proach her. He was already
wondering about filing a suit.”’

“IT wanted to better under-

talking about as an assailant
apparently actually tried to aid
them.”

Buttarazzi was quoted earlier
as saying that he didn’t ‘“‘think
the police responded very well
to’’ the incident.

“When you’re hurt, every
hour seems like days,”’ Sutton
told the two on Friday.

Buttarazzi says now, “That
was my immediate opinion.

Seeing what they’ve done,
they’ve performed better than I
thought they would.”’

“The investigation has been
continuing since the assault was
first reported,’ Sutton said
Tuesday.

“‘We never stop trying to find
out who’s responsible, whether
or not the victims decide to pro-
secute. We want to know who’s
causing problems in the city.’’

 

stand people with physical
stigmas,” St. Clair continued,
“‘What would people’s reaction
be to my blindness. We wanted

to learn about it.

“It was an opportunity to ex-
perience deviance first hand,”’
he continued. ‘And it fit in well
with my Muscular Dystrophy
work.”’

Before the project got under-
way, however, there was dis-
cussion among the class and be-
tween St. Clair and Novack. Yet
few people in the student body
knew about the experiment.

gest problems later, St. Clair
said.

“IT was deceiving close
friends,’’ St. Clair said.

‘Afterwards, what would
their reaction be? It was about
a week later when two of my
friends’ anger really built up.
We almost came to blows.

“T was very sorry about that.
Looking back, I would not do it
again for the world because it
hurt too many people.”

There were over 25 people in
Todd Howe’s Woods Creek
apartment looking on when he
got married, Howe said.

Clair’s adviser, his immediate
family, and his employer, St.
Clair said. The limited class
discussion seemed positive
about St. Clair’s project, he
said.

“The experiment,’’ said St.
Clair, ‘‘was an excellent oppor-
tunity to experience those im-
pairments and grow.”’

“It was a learning experience
for me, but looking back, it was
a poor experiment,” St. Clair
said.

Most of the campus believed
St. Clair was blind. His closest
friends had come to his aid to
make sure that he got dressed
properly and did not injure
himself on the way to class. Yet,
his friends’ helpful reaction

periment,” said Howe. “It was
my initiative to go and talk to
him (Novack) about it — I
didn’t have to.”’

“I had told my friends it
would be an informal ceremony
sO no one went out and rented a

tux. One guy got mad because
he had his jacket cleaned, but I
paid him back for that,’’ Howe
said.

“The ceremony was short
—maybe five minutes. We had
one student pose as a preacher.
At the end (of the vows) we
even kissed like any bride and
groom,” Howe said.

‘Afterward, we had a recep-
tion,’ he said, ‘‘That was all
there was to that phase.”’

Howe said he had alerted his
parents although the girl’s
parents did not know it was an
experiment at the time of the
wedding.

Howe said the bride’s parents
learned of the marriage and did
not find out it was a charade un-
til some days later. Howe said
the explanatory letter the bride
had sent her parents did not ar-
rive on time.

“IT never expected any of the
reaction I got,’’ Howe said. ‘‘I

Because he knew his ac-
complice would be testifying
against him, Hall pleaded guilty
and waived the right to a jury
trial, Read said. In a jury trial
the jury would not have been in-
formed of Hall’s_ previous
criminal record, and he would
have received a_ lighter
sentence than the one he got
from the judge, Read said.

Read said that in all cases,
regardless of whether or not it
involves a plea bargain, the vic-
tim of the crime is informed of
all developments in the case.

“I’m one of a very few
Virginia commonwealth’s at-
torneys who takes the time to
speak to the victim of the crime
and the law enforcement officer
involved,”’ Read said.

Read said that the Rock-
bridge County and Lexington
Victim-Witness Assistance Pro-
gram is considered to be one of
the finest in the state. The pro-
gram operates out of Read’s of-
fice and is coordinated by Deb-
bie Nicely.

“‘To many victims the trial is
a very important moment in
their lives. They appreciate
knowing when the case comes
to court,’’ said Read.

Read, a Republican, is seek-
ing a third four-year term as
Commonwealth’s Attorney for
Rockbridge County and Lex-
ington in the Nov. 8 election.

“T have enjoyed serving this
community as commonwealth’s
attorney for eight years. I hope
I have the good fortune to serve
for another four years,’’ Read
said.

Read said that he had no am-
bitions to hold any political of-
fice higher than common-
wealth’s attorney.

“T enjoy being a criminal pro-
secuter. While people have ask-
ed me to run for other offices, I
have said no each time,’’ Read
said.

Read said that the 12 years of
experience he has gained as a
trial lawyer have been in-
valuable to him in seeing that
justice is done in the court.

Read also said that his three
years at Washington and Lee
Law School were important in
preparing him to be a trial
lawyer. Read was captain of the
Moot Court Team while in law
school.

Read worked for a Richmond
law firm for three years before
being elected Commonwealth’s
Attorney for Rockbridge Coun-
ty and Lexington in November,
1975.

Regarding the purpose of the
criminal justice system, Read
said that the system should
punish criminals, serve as a
deterrent against potential
criminals and_ rehabilitate
criminals.

Read graduated from VMI in
1965. He was a captain in the
U.S. Army in Vietnam from
1965 to 1968 during which time
he was awarded a Bronze Star
and a Purple Heart.

Mock Convention
Correspondent

Mock: (adj.)-merely im-
itating or resembling reality;
sham.

Although Webster meant well
with his definition, it still lacks
the essence of what Washington
and Lee’s Mock Convention,
scheduled for May 11 and 12,
1984, is all about. Admittedly
not reality, the past Mock Con-
ventions held at W&L were far
from shams and were closer to
the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch’s characterization of the
convention as ‘‘the most ac-
curate event of its kind in the
nation.”

Accuracy, authenticity, years
of planning and attention to
detail are the staples of the
mock convention experience
and have been for the past 75
years.

This is not to say however,
that the Mock Convention has
not undergone some changes
over the years. When the idea of
a mock convention was first
suggested by an assistant pro-
fessor of economics and
politics, W. Jett Lauck, and in-
troduced to the public by The
Ring-tum Phi in April, 1908, im-
partiality was not exactly the
prevailing spirit: ‘‘All students
are urged to arouse interest in
the convention and to work in
behalf of their favorite presi-
dential candidate,’ the news-
paper announced.

With a campus that was as
solidly Democratic as the rest
of the South, nothing but a
Democratic convention was
even considered back in the ear-
ly days of the convention.

Those early days of 1908 not
only brought the first Mock Con-
vention to W&L but also the first
correct prediction. William Jen-
nings Bryan, already a two-
time presidential loser for the
real Democrats, was the lead-
ing contender at W&L after fir-
ing up the students with a
speech upon his arrival in Lex-
ington.

As the first convention opened
on May 4, Minnesota Governor
John A. Johnson had almost
enough support to halt a Bryan
sweep. Both sides were poised
for the competition and com-
pete they did. Floor fights
prevailed and became disrup-
tive as these brawls occurred on
the floor! When the final bell
rang at the end of only one
round, Bryan was declared the
victor of W&L’s delegates. That
choice was echoed when the
real Democratic delegates met
in Denver that summer.

Bryan went down in defeat for
the third and last time in the
general election against
William Howard Taft. So 1912
brought W&L students back to
the drawing board as, of course,
another Democratic convention
was held with the hope of not on-
ly choosing the accurate presi-
dential nominee again, but also
of tapping a candidate who
could defeat the Republicans.

They were granted half their
wish.

After five roll calls at W&L,
the students nominated Gover-
nor Judson Harmon of Ohio
over Woodrow Wilson, governor
of New Jersey. Later in
Baltimore the real Democrats
gave the convention nod to
Wilson instead, who went on to
capture the White House.

Mock Convention: a history of accuracy

12 of 17 correct predictions

 

A scene from the floor at the 1980 Mock Convention. (File photo.)

‘rhe year 1916 was a pivotal
one in the history of the conven-
tion. Faced with a_ strong
Democratic incumbent presi-
dent in Wilson, (whose nomina-
tion was not in danger) the
students at W&L wondered
what they were to do. After
weeks of discussion, the ‘‘earth-
shattering’’ decision was made
to hold a Republican conven-
tion.

With a still overwhelmingly
Democratic campus and none
of the Republicans being exact-
ly ‘‘personal favorites’ the
students found the need for ac-
tual research. Thus, the modern
day W&L convention tradition
of predicting the presidential
nominee of the party out of the
White House was born.

Impartial research may have
been initiated out of necessity
but it proved accurate as

Mays moved to grant the per-

imposed. Phillips then sug-
gested to Mays that the motion
be re-stated so that Smith would
be granted the conditional use
permit subject to ‘‘certain
regulations to be negotiated
before the next meeting.”’ The
new motion was then passed
unanimously.

“‘The whole thing was totally
unecessary,’’ Smith said after
the hearing. “I think it was
stupid.”

Smith complained that the ci-
ty needed to define the or-
dinance more clearly before en-
forcing it.

He added that his business
had been damaged by the
lengthy process.

Smith said the ordinance is

Not all cadets
choose military

By SCOTT KENNEDY
Special to the Phi

Although all of the cadets at
the Virginia Military Institute
are enrolled in ROTC and are
obligated to serve in their
selected branch of the military
after graduation, only about 11
percent of the cadets choose the
military as a career.

Because such a small number
of the graduates stay in the
military, VMI has a large place-
ment service which the men can
use when they leave the service,
according to Lt. Col. Royce E.
Jones, head of cadet affairs at
VMI.

“If a guy goes on active duty
for three, five, six or seven
years and then comes off active
duty, he again registers for
placement services and we go
through the job-search pro-
cess,‘‘ Jones said.

The placement service is also
open to cadets looking for sum-
mer jobs. In fact, according to
Jones, “If a cadet goes on ac-

the norm over the past few

years.

Previously, the EC had made
a tentative decision on funds for
each committee immediately
after that committee had de-
fended its budget requests.

Although budget hearings
began Tuesday evening, no
decisions will be made until all
committees have presented
their budgets this year.

Hearings were held Tuesday
evening for 11 organizations,
ranging from the Mock Conven-
tion, asking for $13,632, to the
Hockey Club, asking for $390.

Tonight’s hearings begin at 7
p.m. with the Student Bar
Association and continue with
the Student Association for
Black Unity, the Student Ac-
tivities Board, the Ariel and the

alumni and cadets is dependent

teers. An alumnus can register
to be a placement volunteer
which means he uses _ his
business contacts to help secure
jobs for cadets and alumni,
Jones said.

Not only is the placement of-
fice used to find jobs, it is also
used by employers. Jones said
that he is constantly being con-
tacted by alumni looking to fill
an opening. In short Jones said,
the placement office at VMI
acts as an employment agency
for it’s cadets and alumni; it
finds jobs and fills openings.

The office depends on the
alumni for placement volun-

port, Jones said.

“Our operating budget for our

vate funds,’’ he explained.

Developer Clyde H. Mull an-
nounced Monday the comple-
tion of the first townhouses to be
constructed in the Rockbridge
area: Lexington Townhomes.

One unit was completely fur-
nished on Tuesday, right down
to the towels and place settings
by Schewel and Leggett, in
preparation for the open house
Mull will be holding Sept. 30
through Oct. 2.

The controversial project,
which drew resistance from
both the city and neighbors, is
right next to the city/county
line. The townhouses are
located off Thorn Hill Road on
Lexington Avenue, which was
created for the development.

“‘Lexington’s been here for
over two hundred years, and
there was no Lexington Avenue,
and we thought there ought to
be,’’ Mull said.

The developer said the five
units, the first of the five phases
he plans for the site, will pro-
bably spur the building of other
similar projects in this area.

“‘T think there are going to be
more,’’ he said.

Lexington Townhomes, which
took five months to actually
build, has been in the planning
stages for at least five years,
according to Mull, who has been
self-employed since leaving the
state police force twelve years
ago.

Much of that pre-construction
time was spent in hearings with
the Lexington Planning Com-
mission and City Council.

Mull originally proposed a
cluster arrangement for the
five units, but since he was
unable to secure the necessary
changes in the zoning or-
dinances, they have been built
in the more traditional linear
scheme.

Nearby residents were wor-
ried about problems with traffic
and surface water runoff which
might result from the develop-
ment.

“Naturally, they’re going to
be concerned about what’s
upstream,’’ said Mull, who had
his plans checked by a con-
sulting engineer and by Central
Shenandoah Planning District
officials from Staunton.

‘People are reluctant to see
any change,” he continued. “It
was fear of the unknown — not
knowing many months ago
what this was going to look like.

“T live right across the hill, so
I'll see that it’s well manicured
and well cared for, so anyone
living here would be proud to
call this their home.”’

Mull is enthusiastic as he
takes a visitor through the
homes, continuously using
words like ‘‘huge,”’ ‘‘the latest’’
and ‘‘the best.”’

“T think the purchaser, for
what he’s paying, is getting an
excellent deal,’ hesaid. «

He also hopes it will be a
“money-making proposition.”’
“T am in the free enterprise
system, and that’s the name of
the game,’’ Mull said. ‘‘I should
be able to turn a profit.”

During construction, Mull
emphasized energy efficiency
in the designs, which is seen in
features like double windows, a
triple-insulated smoke pipe on
the chimney, and energy-saving
metal doors.

The developer said such
features are important be-
cause, although people have

By G. BRUCE POTTER

Although most positions for
the 1984 Washington and Lee
Mock Democratic Convention

several openings available.

With a record of 12 correct
predictions in 17 attempts,
W&L’s Mock Convention stands
unequaled. In fact, since 1948,
W&L_ delegates have been
wrong only once — in 1972, when
they nominated Edward Ken-
nedy over George McGovern.
Years that have had correct
conclusions include Kennedy in
1960, Goldwater in 1964, Nixon
in 1968, Carter in 1976 and
Reagan in 1980.

Presently, the Steering Com-

vention is in full swing, working
to uphold the history of ac-
curacy. In later articles we will
be taking a look behind the

Girard, Wilson shine
as Generals romp 28-/

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals won their first game
of the young season last Satur-
day with a 28-7 Homecoming
victory over the Centre College
Colonels.

Tailback Gene Girard had his
best day as a collegian as he
rushed for 170 yards and two
TD’s on 17 carries. ‘“‘Gene had a
big day running the ball and
much of his success can be trac-
ed to the way our offensive line
get out and blocked their people
at the corners. I think our ex-
perience on the offensive line
began to show because the
veterans we have in that area
have begun to make adjust-
ments on the run,” stated
Fallon.

Washington and Lee got on
the scoreboard in the first
quarter when QB Bobby Wilson
hit tight end Rob Brown with a
13-yard scoring pass. On the
play, Brown made a_ spec-
tacular catch as he went up high
to wrestle the ball away from
two Colonel defenders. James
White added the PAT and W&L
led, 7-0.

“Rob Brown and Ian Banwell,

our tight ends, both had excep-
tional afternoons catching the
ball and also blocking,” said
Fallon.

Early in the second quarter,
Girard scored the first of his
two touchdowns as he ran it in
from 39 yards. White’s kick was
again good, increasing the W&L
lead to 14-0 with 11:52 remain-
ing in the first half.

The key moment in the game
came later in the quarter when
the W&L defense stopped Cen-
tre on a fourth down and one at
the two-yard line. The outcome
was never in doubt after this
goal-line stand. On the day, the
General defense forced four
Centre turnovers and was led
by end Charlie Alcorn (7 tac-
kles, 1 fumble recovery) and
tackle Mark Weaver (7 tac-
kles).

Fallon also had praise for his
secondary as they held danger-
ous Centre quarterback Mike
Hall to only 115 yards passing
and no touchdowns.

“The secondary played well
and Kelvin Newsome came up
with a key interception. Chris
Wilson stepped in back there
when Bob Jenevein went down
with a bruised shoulder and did
a fine job,” Fallon stated.

Near the outset of the second
half, Girard broke loose again
and went 62 yards for the score,
putting W&L ahead 21-0. Bobby
Wilson closed out the W&L scor-
ing for the day as he tossed his
fourth touchdown pass of the
year — a 14 yarder to Tom
Wiser. White kicked his fourth
PAT of the day and W&L led
28-0 with 10:12 remaining in the
game.

Centre posted its lone score
with 2:47 left as Meredith
Evans carried it in from one
yard out. Kelsey was good on
the PAT, making the final
score, 28-7.

W&L faces ODAC rival Ran-
dolph-Macon this Saturday at
Ashland, Va. The Generals
must win this game in order to
keep their ODAC championship
hopes alive.

Randolph-Macon is 0-3 on the
season, but Fallon is not about
to let overconfidence afflict his
troops.

‘Don’t let their record fool
you. Randolph-Macon has
played three very strong foot-
ball teams. By now they’re used
to playing difficult opposition
and they’re bound to be mighty
hungry for a win.”’

Kick-off is set for 1:30 p.m.

Soccer storms to two straight

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Generals upped their

record to 2-1 with a come-from-
behind victory over visiting
Mary Washington yesterday.
The General kickers defeated
the ‘Blue Tide 2-1 to claim their
second straight victory.

Senior co-captain Roland
Simon scored his third goal of
the season with 20 minutes left

 

in the game after the Blue Tide _

  

had gotten their only goal eight
minutes into the second half.
Junior midfielder Mark Sulli-
van scored the game-winner
with ten minutes left on an in-
direct free kick just inside the
Mary Washington penalty box.

ves downfield in the Generals 2-1 victory over

 

away with a 2-0 upset shutout at
Averett.

Offensively the Generals’
first two games could not have
been more similar. Senior co-
captain Roland Simon scored
first for the Generals at the 24-
minute mark from an assist by
sophomore Billy Homes. The
same combination tallied
W&L’s first goal last week, also.

And for the second week in a
row junior Jeff Reichert scored
the second General goal off of a
Randall Ray corner kick. Simon
also got an assist when he
deflected Ray’s corner kick to
Reichert who sent it home for a
2-0 General lead with 24 minutes
left.

But Averett, the top-ranked
team in the region, kept the
game “tight all the way to the
end,”’ according to Piranian. A
missed penalty kick with eight
minutes left and the play of
goalies Jay Werner (8 saves)
and Mark McDonough (2 saves)
kept Averett off the seoreboard.
McDonough replaced Werner
with 12 minutes left in the
game.

While Averett could not get on
the scoreboard, they held their
own in the statistics, leading
W&L in corner kicks, 7-6, while
the Generals held the edge in
shots taken, 17-15.

Generals is at Maryville Col-
lege on Saturday, followed by a

Coaches still see
improvement as
polo goes to /-5

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team compiled a
record of 1-3 last weekend in the
Northeast Varsity invitational
which was played at Brown
University in Providence,
Rhode Island. The Generals, 7-5
overall, defeated M.I.T., but
lost to Slippery Rock and Navy.
Navy and Brown have unde-
feated records in the tourna-
ment which will be completed
Oct. 14, 15 and 16 at the
Southeast Varsity Invitational
in Annapolis, Maryland.

Although W&L was 1-3 last
weekend, the coaches were
pleased with the team’s perfor-
mance. Assistant Coach Bob
Newcomb said, ‘‘We feel that
we got what we wanted out of
the tournament,’’ According to
Coach Newcomb, the substitu-
tion plan that W&L initiated last
weekend worked very well.

The W&L freshmen are con-
tinuing to make progress stated
Coach Newcomb. He said, ‘‘The
B team is making leaps and
bounds to some very fine water
polo.”’

The continued progress of the
freshmen combined with W&L’s

new method of substitution is
moving the Generals toward the
accomplishment of their goals.
W&L is not concerned with the
outcome of the games right
now. The Generals’ long range
goals are focused on the
Southern, Conference Cham-
pionships Coach Newcomb said,
“Everything we do is aimed at
that (the Southern Conference
Championships). We feel that
that is where we are really go-
ing to excel.”’

This weekend W&L will host
The Generals Invitational. The
tournament will be played Oct.
1 and 2 at the Cy Twombly Pool.
W&L will enter an A and a B
team. Teams from the Univer-
sity of Dayton, George Wash-
ington University, Lynchburg
College and the Northern
Virginia Aquatic Club will also
participate. The playing times
of W&L teams were not
available at press time.

Regarding the tournament,
Coach Newcomb said, ‘‘The A
team should win all of their
games this weekend.”’ He add-
ed, ‘‘This is a big weekend for
the B team. The freshmen will
pick up a lot of good ex-
perience,”’

Review ‘and Outlook

Eller’s speech

The recipe is quite simple:

Invite a well-known speaker to campus and stand
him behind the Lee Chapel podium with a Washington
and Lee grad who says he’s happy to be on that side of
the lectern.

Publicize the event widely on the undergraduate
and law school campuses as well as in the town.

Give the speaker a topical subject to discuss.

The result will be an informative, but entertaining,
evening that should appeal to a variety of students
and townspeople. And those who attended last Thurs-
day’s drug education program were not disappointed.

Warren Welsh, a W&L alumnus who is now Director
of Security for the National Football League, and Carl
Eller, a five-time all-pro defensive lineman with the
Minnesota Vikings, spoke to a receptive Lee Chapel
audience on drug abuse.

The audience was noticeably diverse. A number of
Washington and Lee athletes were on hand, as were
other students from both W&L and VMI.

The younger set were also in attendance. Apparent-
ly at the request of a local elementary school teacher,
the youngsters, particularly the boys, were enthralled
at listening to and getting the autograph of one of
their football heroes.

Eller’s talk was, as those who were there will attest,
dynamic and thought-provoking. His personal tale of
how alcohol abuse led to drug abuse and his ex-
periences along the way kept the audience attentive
— few checked their watches.

Not only has the issue of drug abuse pervaded life
here at Washington and Lee, but it also has been a
pressing issue in society as a whole, notably in the Na-
tional Football League. In those respects, the pro-
gram last Thursday was bound to attract a large au-
dience, and, indeed, it did.

The Athletic Department deserves kudos for ar-
ranging the program.

And Contact should take note.

Destroying the myths of rape
Dear Editor: sleep around at all the houses.
vie : She’s not one of those. She’s a
“He'll understand if I knock —_very decent kid who got caught
him on the head.”’

When she said that, I thought
my Lexington friend was over-
reacting to my speculation that
Police Chief L.O. Sutton
misunderstood the nature of
rape, specifically the rape of a
Randolph-Macon freshman at
the PiKA house Sept. 15.

Sutton said to The Phi, ‘“‘She’s
a hell of a decent kid. . . .She
came to a party to have a good
time and this happened to her.

“She’s not like some girls
who’ve been around for years
and make all the parties and

in a very tragic situation.”’

The more I thought about the
quote, the more I wondered if
the Chief would find it less
“tragic” if someone had raped
a woman who the Chief thought
slept around at the houses.
That’s wrong, but it still didn’t
seem grounds for knocking him
on the head.

It is only natural to think that
some girls live so licentiously
that they are ‘‘asking for it.”
It’s natural curiosity to wonder
if the rape victim ‘‘enjoyed it,”
as I heard a friend wonder. We
usually let these statements

Plus/minus system questioned

To the Editors:

I do not understand why the
new plus/minus system of
grading affects the entire stu-
dent body and not just the
freshmen. Has it not been in the
past to implement new rules to
an incoming class? For exam-
ple, the 121 credit requirement
as opposed to the old 115 hour
requirement affects only the
Classes of 86 and ’87. Why
should students who have been

able to work under one system
for two or three years have to
change in the middle of their
college careers? I think a large
number of students are con-
cerned or at least interested in
this new rule, but they feel that
the rule change is final. I hope
that more people will be able to
voice opinions about this unfair
act.

Committee set to
study calendar

To the Editors:

President Wilson has ap-
pointed an ad hoc committee to
examine the effectiveness of the
university’s undergraduate
academic calendar. This com-
mittee is beginning its delibera-
tions and is actively seeking in-
put from all members of the
university community, especi-
ally the student body. We
welcome your participation
through petitions or written
comments or by speaking with
one or more members of the
committee.

As we continue our work, we

intend to make our conclusions
public and to solicit further
comment. We hope that our
final recommendations will
represent a consensus opinion
with some solid responses to ob-
jections that may arise.
Members of the committee
are Rob Woods and Lee
Feldman from the student
body, Professors Beckley,
Cook, Jennings, Ray, Sanders,
Spencer, Stephenson, and Wise,
and Mr. Head (ex officio).
John H. Wise
Chairman

States, a central concern is the
destruction of myths about
rape. They have fought, suc-
cessfully, the idea that rape is
as much a sexual attack as ‘‘an
act of physical violence,” as
said the woman who would
thump the Chief. Which means
that a woman with a bad
reputation is NO MORE LIKE-
LY to be raped than anyone
else. Vulnerability, not ir-
resistability, attracts the
rapist.

But a worse myth is that rape
is more often the work of the
criminal psychopath than it is
“the callous violation of a
woman’s sexual rights by a
man she knows,”’ as Jean
MackKellar has written.

Dean clarifies
statement

To the Editors:

A brief word about the Sept.
15 Phi article ‘‘Orientation call-
ed ragged.’’ The statement at-
tributed to me about ‘‘too many
athletic tests’? hampering
freshmen’s meeting with their
advisers has been perceived as
a criticism of the Physical
Education Department. This
was not my intention, if indeed
they were even my words. Both
the P.E. Proficiency Tests and
the Freshmen Athlete’s Physi-
cal Examinations are univer-
sity requirements, which are
simply administered by the
Athletic Department and Infir-
mary staff respectively.

I had hoped that the tenor of
my complete statement to the
Phi would have made clear that
characterizing Orientation
Week as “‘ragged’’ was a mea
culpa judgment.

Experiment

(continued from page 5)

‘Neither one of us thought it
would be a big thing,’ Howe
noted.

‘‘Most of the people said they
thought it was not for real,”
Howe said. ‘‘Why? Maybe they
didn’t want to seem fooled by
my charade — whatever you
want to call it. Some were mad.
Some were scoffing at it.”

Howe was very insistent that
the result was not Novack’s
fault.

‘*He had no idea of how it was
going to come out,” Howe said.

‘‘We had met once or twice for
about 20 minutes.”

When Howe was asked about
his talks with Novack, he said
they had discussed what could
go wrong, and had tried to an-
ticipate possible problems.

‘“‘He was really interested in
how I would deal with telling
people about the experiment.
We hadn’t talked specifically
about ethics. We really didn’t
say how ethical it was. We ask-
ed how feasible it was,’’ Howe
explained.

wae With nukes comes

responsibility

(continued from page 3)

The role of ‘Saviour of
Humanity”’ is one that we are
accustomed to assume. If we
truly are in the right, the first
ethical question we must face
as a nuclear power is whether
nuclear weaponry can ever be
safely stored. Is there any con-
ceiveable flawless situation in
which they may be kept? In the
bishops’ words:

“Do the exorbitant costs, the
general climate of insecurity
generated, the possibility of ac-
cidental detonation of highly
destructive weapons, the
danger of error and miscalcula-
tion that could provoke retalia-
tion and war — do such evils or
others attendant upon and in-
directly deriving from the arms
race make the arms race itself
a disproportionate response to
aggression?’’ Perhaps it best be
left a rhetorical question.

strikes deep into politics, into
the very definition of a nation-
state. Is the idea of a state and
nuclear arms incompatible?

“The presumption of the
nation-state system, that
sovereignty implies an ability
to protect a nation’s territory
and population, is precisely the
presumption denied by the
nuclear capacities of both
superpowers. In a sense each is
at the mercy of the other’s
perception of what strategy is
‘rational,’ what kind of damage
is ‘unacceptable,’ how ‘convinc-
ing’ one’s threat is to the
other.”

It’s a whole new ball game.
Protection is impossible: our
country is no longer capable of
defending us except through
threats. Our defense depends

upon the rationality of the
Soviets (in which we usually
place so little confidence). The
Soviets are equally dependent
on our rationality.

That no rational man could
start a nuclear war seems
clear; no conceivable reason
for doing so is thinkable. We are
not only dependent on the in-
creasingly growing nuclear
powers’ rationality, but also on
something else — a new found
flawlessness in human abili-
ties.

When this perfection was
starting to bloom in 1945, some
leaders suggested nuclear arms
would lead to an end to war.
But, ‘‘rather than eliminate the
causes of war, the arms race
serves only to aggravate the
position. As long as extravagant
sums of money are poured into
the development of new
weapons, it is impossible to
devote adequate aid in tackling
the misery which prevails at the
present day in the world.

The problem is_ indeed
spreading into more unmanage-
able sizes. Where will it be in
another ten years when ter-
rorists have the bomb? What
sort of news stories are we go-
ing to get used to? (‘‘Heard
about Detroit? Heard about
Pittsburgh, PA?” David Byrne,
“Life During Wartime’’)

We need to get serious. We
need to come to terms with
what is around us, what it can
do, and what it means. We need
to see we can no longer post-
pone the issue. At the very
least, we need to discuss it.

NOTE: Bishop Walter Sulli-
van will speak Tuesday, Oct. 4
at 8 p.m. in Northen Auditorium
of the University Library.

 

 

Rape

(continued from page 2)
These are the rapes that are
so rarely reported, and are
propagated by the ignorance
you find at a place like, sur-

prise, Washington and Lee.
Take your average woman’s
college freshman and a typical
fraternity man. The stereotype
is accepted that he will try to
take what he can get, and that
her ‘“‘no’s” will mean ‘“‘maybe’”’
and her ‘‘maybe’s”’ will mean
‘“‘ves.’’ If she rejects him, ac-
cording to this script, he will
think she’s a bitch, and if she
gives any ground at all before
drawing the line, she’s a tease.

Add alcohol, and the stage is set
for rape by the non-stranger.
Although the enlightened
world now condemns as rape
any sex the victim does not
want, the victim of rape by an
old boyfriend or blind date at
W&L might naturally blame
herself. If she hadn’t said this or
that, if she had been firmer in
refusing him, if she hadn’t been
so gripped by fear, embarrass-
ment and disbelief that she
couldn’t fight him off or just run
out, then, maybe, it wouldn’t
have happened. MacKellar
noted that for these reasons and
others, only one in ten or one in

twenty of these rapes will be
reported.

That being so, you can see
why a woman like my friend
would strike out against any
hint of the Monster Ignorance
that heightens the chances that
she or one of her friends will be
raped.

But the battle against rape
will go unnoted at W&L until
there are more feminine voices
among the students and the
faculty to sound the alarm. And
it is not just the problem of rape
and violence against women
that we ignore. We are missing

lessons that Western Civiliza-
tion began to learn when the
coeducation process in schools
and the public forum began in
earnest fifteen years ago, leav-
ing W&L behind.

Rape is so horrible, painful
and degrading. But it feeds on
the ignorance that grows down
in us, despite our good natures,
because we must wait until age
22 and graduation to be exposed
to sunlight.

Perhaps the lessons women
can teach us cannot be put off
until then.
