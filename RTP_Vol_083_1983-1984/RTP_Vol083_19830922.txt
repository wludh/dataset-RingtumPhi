EC fires Matrazzo

Mock Con tri-chairman out

By RICK SWAGLER
Chief Editor

Monday night the Executive
Committee rescinded the ap-
pointment of Steve Matrazzo,
the Mock Convention tri-
chairman in charge of political
research.

Student body President Bob
Jenevein said, ‘‘The EC felt that
in his position he would not
allow the convention to be as
good as it could be.”’

Jenevein said that Matrazzo
didn’t offer a resignation, forc-
ing the EC to rescind the ap-
pointment.

Matrazzo said that he thought
the EC handled the situation ‘“‘in
a relatively responsible man-
ner.”

EC secretary Len Howard
said, ‘“‘We wanted it to be as
relaxed an atmosphere as possi-
ble.”’

According to Matrazzo, each
tri-chairman made a statement
in Monday night’s closed EC
meeting and the committee
then questioned the three. The
committee deliberated and then
passed rescission on a voice
vote.

Matrazzo’s appointment, as
well as the appointments of the
two other tri-chairmen, Steve
Lewis and Peter Muller, were
made at the beginning of last
year.

On the following morning,
~ Jenevein received the resigna-
tions of Howard, the Lower
South Regional Coordinator and
John Haywood, Facilities
Chairman,

“I do not want my resignation

from the Mock Convention —

steering committee to appear
as if I had decided beforehand
that if I disagreed with the EC
as a whole I would resign,”’
Howard said. “I had some
doubts whether I could work
with the (Mock Convention)
committee,’’ he said.

Jenevein said he would be

surprised if he received any
more resignations. Lee
Feldman, the Mock Conven-
tion’s administrator, agreed.

According to Lewis, the
resignations have caused the
committee to alter its structure.
The Southern region, which had
been split into Upper and Lower
divisions, may be joined as a
result.

Regarding Matrazzo’s_ re-

sponsibilities, Lewis said, ‘‘We
have already spoken to Jack
Dent (Upper South Regional
Coordinator) about assuming
some of the responsibilities of
the political tri-chairman. We
assume that he will take on
these responsibilities.’’
Matrazzo said that the com-
mittee’s problems began with
the ‘“‘dynamics of having three

Rush dry, smooth

By PETER WRIGHT
Staff Reporter

Fraternity Rush at
Washington and Lee is in its
third week, and coordinator of
Fraternity Affairs, Dean Dan
Murphy said, ‘‘So far, rush has
gone pretty smoothly from the
perspective of the IFC (Inter-
fraternity Council).”

A major change in the struc-
ture of the 1983 fraternity Rush

compared to last year is that
the Rush Date parties are dry,
meaning that beer and other
alcoholic beverages are not per-
mitted. Previously, only the
Open House parties were dry.

The decision to hold dry Rush
dates was that of the IFC
Judicial Board, but the new rule
was a result of the Virginia
legislature raising the legal
drinking age to 19.

IFC Rush chairman Drew
Clark said if the IFC Judicial
Board had not passed the new
Rush provision, University of-
ficials would have eventually
passed it themselves.

“We just beat them to the
gun,”’ Clark said.

The monitoring of the dry
Rush parties is a system of
“self-regulation,” according to
Clark. He explained that two
representatives selected from
each fraternity were responsi-
ble for inspecting the activities
of other fraternities and making
sure they were abiding by all
IFC Rush principles.

Over 320 students par-
ticipated in Rush this year at
W&L, and they seemed more
aware and better prepared than
in previous years, Dean Mur-
phy said.

“They (the freshmen) seem
to be asking more questions and
are more leery of fraternities,”
Murphy commented.

Homecoming bows to Fall Weekend

While the 1983 Homecoming
weekend at Washington and Lee
will feature the W&L vs. Centre
game Saturday afternoon as
well as several traditional
alumni events, the weekend will
be void of the various social ac-
tivities by which it has been
marked in previous years.

Due to the early date of the
homecoming game and the lin-
gering Rush process, the Stu-
dent Activities Board has plan-

ned a Fall Weekend Oct. 28-31 to
feature a concert and other
events instead of attempting to
schedule traditional homecom-
ing activities this weekend, ac-
cording to SAB Treasurer John
Haywood.

Haywood said that the SAB is
sponsoring one band, The
Phonecops, in the Cockpit
Saturday night.

Homecoming activities for
returning alumni will include a
series of recreational events, in-

cluding a run on Lexington’s
Chessie Trail. The alumni will
be guests at a buffet luncheon
prior to the football game and at
a post-game reception.

Washington and Lee’s game
with Centre will be at 1:30 p.m.
on Wilson Field. The Homecom-
ing queen will be crowned at
halftime of the football game.

In addition, the Generals’
cross-country team will run
against Washington College and
Mary Washington College at 11

a.m. Saturday.

Other events scheduled for
Homecoming weekend include
the annual John Randolph
Tucker Lecture featuring
Eugene D. Genovese, author of

“Roll, Jordan, Roll,’ at 4:15
p.m. on Friday in the Moot
Courtroom of Lewis Hall, meet-
ings of both the law and under-
graduate alumni boards, and an
Alumni-Varsity lacrosse match
at 1p.m. on Sunday.

Review and Outlook

A lack of courtesy

We do not question the reasons behind the removal
of Steve Matrazzo as the Mock Convention tri-
chairman in charge of political research. By all ac-
counts the Executive Committee acted responsibly.

While the Student Body Constitution neither bars
the Phi nor allows it to attend hearings such as this or
others concerning subcommittee personnel, the Phi
stayed out of the meeting. We felt that our presence
might prevent the Committee and the tri-chairmen
from speaking freely.

We do, however, question the circumstances sur-
rounding the rescission of Matrazzo’s appointment.

Matrazzo says he was never overtly confronted by
the other tri-chairmen concerning his performance
until six days before his appointment was rescinded.
At that meeting with his colleagues, he was asked to
resign.

Matrazzo was never reprimanded, given a ‘“‘trial
period” or put on ‘‘probation.”’

Matrazzo was never even officially notified by the
Committee that his appointment was being reviewed.
He was never officially asked to appear before the
Committee to defend himself.

The first official word Matrazzo heard of the Com-
mittee’s decision was in the minutes of the meeting
rather than through the courtesy of a telephone call or
a visit.

Student Body President Bob Jenevein explained
that ‘‘pressures of time’’ caused these problems, say-
ing the circumstances were ‘“‘unfortunate.”’

When the pressures of time become so great as to
preclude common courtesy and protocol, the reasons
behind these sudden “‘pressures” should be examin-
ed.

Just as Matrazzo says we can learn from the pro-
blems associated with having three chairmen, so can
we learn from the unprofessional way in which the
Committee handled the details of their decision.

Are W&L
students
victims of
police?

To the Editors:

By now nearly everyone in
the W&L community is aware of
the violence that has taken
place within the past week. A
freshman girl was raped on the
second floor of a fraternity
house by a local black male,
and two W&L students were
assaulted and badly beaten by a
gang of black males. It isn’t the
first time that innocent students
have been assaulted for no ap-
parent reason. It seems that
every year there are half a
dozen or more separate in-
cidents where students are bad-
ly assaulted and hospitalized
while on their way home from a
late-night party.

The problem seems simple
enough and has existed for
generations: resentful townies
love to gang up on “rich white
boys” and beat the hell out of
them just for the fun of it
(Saturday night entertain-
ment). They obviously know
they can get away with it and
will continue to do so as long as
they remain unchecked. The
question of how to solve this
problem would seem simple
enough: simply let the police
department and the State
Troopers handle it, but this is
not the case. The police depart-
ment and the State Troopers
are, quite simply, incompetent.
There are a few exceptions
within the departments but they
are overshadowed by the ma-
jority of ‘law enforcement”’ of-
ficials.

 

 

 

 

 

 

I will admit that the police do
a wonderful job of telling frater-
nities they are being too noisy
and trying to bust a few stu-
dents who might (God forbid)
try to drink a beer at age 18, as
well as towing visiting girls’
cars away. But while the ‘‘good
ol’ boys’ are giving the
students as much of a hassle as
possible, (the ‘‘rich white boy”’
syndrome) the local youths are

raping young girls and beating
up students as well as stealing

Put Phi-EC battle

To the Editors:

Under the banner headline
“Paper starting on shaky
ground’”’ Scott Mason’s column
last week criticized The Phi for
not covering EC meetings last
spring and chided those who
defended the Phi’s right to this
action.

“The Ring-tum Phi had a du-
ty to cover every Executive
Committee (meeting) whether
the EC ‘looks over its shoulder’
(quoting Rick Swagler) or not.’’
wrote Mason, who should have
added that he was serving on
the EC last year.

And I should reveal that I
watched the EC criticize editor
Bill Roberts with the eyes of a
former editor; indeed, I

covered the EC 18 weeks my- —

self. I saw good government,
but I also witnessed hours of
pointless jabber, watched mem-
bers swap insults, learned of a
student body officer distribu-
ting anonymous posters to at-
tack a member during his re-
‘election campaign, and have
earned an EC president’s wrath

quite unintentionally because I
didn’t cover what he wanted
covered.

The service of the EC to the
school far outweighs any of this,
but my point is that the spine of
this issue of coverage is not The
Phi’s duty, but the EC’s egos.

Not that last year’s editor had
a small ego. Called in the Com-
mittee for a stern lecture on his
responsibilities, he sank to the
occasion, saying, “You guys
are a bunch of self-serving
douche-bags.”’ But then, Bill
Roberts had not come to tell the
EC how to do its job, but to be
told how to do his.

Describing the meeting,
Mason wrote, ‘‘Insults flew and
at least one member of the EC
voted to reprimand Roberts.”
This suggests that the EC has
some authority to reprimand an
editor, the way Congress might
censure a member, and such
power the EC does not have.
The above phrase also obscures
the fact that eight or nine
members of the EC did not vote
to reprimand Roberts.

everything they can get their
hands on.

The police are unsympathetic
to students and are probably
scared stiff of the young locals
who roam the streets at night.
After the two W&L students
were taken to the hospital and
one of their roommates, Jim
Noble ’85, was trying to get help
from the State Troopers, he was
shocked at the laughter and
gaiety that the ‘‘good ol’ boys”

(continued on page 16)

aside

My purpose is not to impugn
Scott Mason’s undoubtable ex-
cellence and humility as a
writer and student leader, but
to remind the EC and The Phi
how pathetic their record of
mutual animosity would seem
to the students if revealed.

Doubtless The Phi will cover
the EC this year, and doubtless
the EC will feel itself misrepre-
sented at some point. That’s
when the EC can get its views
across to the students in the
most productive way — by tak-
ing advantage of the fact that
The Phi hardly ever has enough
copy and almost always runs
columns and letters to the
editors.

Right or wrong, Bill Roberts’
paper is gone now and The Phi
is not on “‘shaky ground.” But
let its new editors pledge them-
selves to cooperation instead of
confrontation, and let the EC
do likewise, both remembering
that in the eyes of the students
their titanic struggles seem
sometimes just so much midget

wrestling. ;

WW&L and VMI fumble their calendars

By SCOTT MASON

If you haven’t already seen the school calendar, you
may want to soon. In case you didn’t know, Homecom-
ing is two days away and if you were planning to invite
a young woman for the weekend, you’d better move
fast.

Unfortunately for some W&L administration mem-
bers, finding a date for the weekend is the least of their
worries. For months they’ve been knocking their heads
together to come up with a school calendar that will
please everybody, a calendar that doesn’t spring
Homecoming Weekend on you a week and a half after
classes start.

For those who have studied this year’s calendar, an

early Homecoming Weekend that barely gives you -

time to blink isn’t the only event to bitch about. Parents
Weekend falls on Nov. 12, less than a week before
Thanksgiving Vacation. That could discourage some
parents from attending since most will see their sons a
few days later anyway.

It would seem that the ideal time for Homecoming
would be the beginning of October and for Parents
Weekend the end of October. So what’s the problem?

The problem, if you can believe it, has largely to do
with football. Traditionally, one of the big attractions
of Homecoming and Parents weekend is the Saturday
afternoon football game. The problem isn’t that W&L
doesn’t have any home football games; rather, VMI’s
home games fall on the same date as W&L’s.

Home football games at VMI attract huge crowds
and, in turn, bring big business to Lexington mer-
chants. Hotel rooms, just to house the opposing team,
are quickly filled, and restaurants boom.

If W&L were to schedule Homecoming or Parents
Weekend on the same date as a VMI home football
game, Lexington merchants would be swamped. The

Professor comments on Soviets

nearest place to grab dinner or stay for the night would
be Buena Vista or Natural Bridge, several miles down
the road.

If, however, W&L’s Homecoming and Parents Week-
end and VMI’s home football games were held on
separate occasions, merchants would then be able to
accomodate the crowds. They’d also bring in more
money, because they wouldn’t be forced to turn away
customers.

It would seem the solution to the problem would be
for W&L and VMI to sit down and arrange their
schedules so that they don’t conflict.

There is some contact between the two schools, ac-
cording to Carter McNeese, one of the ‘“‘poor souls’’ in
charge of scheduling university events. However, be

 

Readers’ Advocate

 

that as it may, football schedules are apt to change and
have a knack for doing so after a Homecoming or Par-
ents Weekend has been set.

That’s what happened this year, according to
McNeese. W&L wanted to have its Parents weekend on
Nov. 5, but didn’t have a home football game. VMI was
scheduled to play at home on the fifth anyway so that
would have made it doubly impossible to have Parents
Weekend then. Every weekend in October was filled so
that the only day open was Nov. 12. W&L had a home
game on the 12th, and VMI was away. McNeese and
others reluctantly set the date of Parents Weekend for
the 12th knowing that Thanksgiving Vacation was just
a week later.

“‘There was nothing we could do about it,’” McNeese

said. ‘‘We realize that Nov. 12 is a rotten date for it.
We’ve gotten complaints from parents, faculty, and
students, and we knew they were going to come.”’

But when it rains, it pours, and what was a bad situa-
tion quickly got worse. Sometime during the summer,
after Parents Weekend was already set, VMI changed
its football schedule. Instead of playing at home on the
fifth and away on the 12th as had originally been sche-
duled, the Keydets now play away on the fifth and
home on the 12th. Consequently, W&L has run headlong
into a situation it had been desperately trying all along
to avoid. Parents Weekend this year falls on the same
day as a VMI home game, Nov. 12. So much for the
Lexington merchants.

What’s more, W&L had also altered its schedule. The
Generals were playing away on the fifth, but now play
at home. That leaves the fifth entirely open, which was
the date the administration had wanted to have Par-
ents Weekend in the first place.

Scheduling conflicts have occurred in the past. In
1979 Parents Weekend was as it is this year, a week
away from Thanksgiving Vacation. Nevertheless, a
large number of parents still attended the event, ac-
cording to Frank Parsons, assistant to the president.
Parsons doesn’t expect drastic decline in parent at-
tendance this year either.

Already, W&L is expecting similar scheduling con-
flicts next year as the ’84-85 calendar begins to take
shape. Meanwhile, university faculty are as far away
from a solution to the ‘‘Great Calendar Quandary” as
they ever nave been.

One administration member suggested dropping
football. That, he explained, was the only way out of
the mess, and indeed it looks like he may be right. But
for now, the football Generals continue to play ball,
while the W&L administration continues to fumble the
schedule.

By NELSON PATTERSON
Staff Reporter

President Reagan’s failure to
follow up his tough talk with
tough action has prompted
many of his political allies to
criticize his leadership. W&L
Professor Craig McCaughrin
believes Reagan can salvage
his ‘‘get-tough” image by tak-
ing a risky step — walking away
from the Geneva arms talks.

“Let’s leave Geneva,” Mc-
Caughrin says. “It’s the only
ace up our sleeve. The Soviets
consider the talks to be salient.
Their behavior at the talks has
not been all that laudible.”’

While McCaughrin admits
such a bold move embodies a
risk of nuclear war and a con-
tinuation of the frigid U.S.-
Soviet relations, he believes it is
the only move the United States
has to show its degree of
outrage.

Reagan’s not placing sanc-
tions on the Russians was a
smart move. ‘Sanctions have
the effect of slapping (the Rus-
sians) with a wet noodle. A
grain embargo won’t hurt the
Russian leadership. The Rus-
sians (people) see sacrifice as
an honor, versus something to
avoid. You fall into the trap of
hurtihg the people and not those
responsible for the affair,’’ Mc-

Caughrin said.

Lifting Aeroflot landing
rights will create an annual loss
of $2 million for the Russians,
peanuts in view of their
estimated $300 billion annual
outlay for defense. ‘‘The
response of our allies was disap-
pointing. Why only (lift landing
rights) for two weeks? Why not
two months?,”’ questioned Mc-
Caughrin ‘‘Now we see the Sovi-
ets have effectively created a
monopoly on travel in and out of
Moscow, and they’re over-
charging on those flights
anyway. That’s giving them the
hard currency they need.”’

McCaughrin sees withdraw-
ing from the arms talks as the
best alternative. ‘Do we really
have that much to lose by walk-
ing away from Geneva? The
arms talks don’t modify Soviet
behavior. SALT I and SALT II
seemed to have incurred a
number of Soviet infractions. If
the Geneva conference were to
result in a reduction in nuclear
arms, the agreement would not
be followed by the Soviets,’’ he
noted.

(McCaughrin noted that one
Soviet defector has hypothesiz-
ed that one reason KAL 007 was
shot down was that it was flying
over an area where missiles for-
bidden by SALT I and SALT II
are being illegally manufac-
tured.)

Though he does not agree

should leave the arms talks, McCaughrin says

with William F. Buckley, Jr.’s
assessment that Reagan will be
the 270th victim of the plane’s
mishap, McCaughrin believes
the public saw a mellowed
Ronald Reagan reacting to the
affair and offers several prob-
ing questions explaining the
change in character.

— ‘We are coming into an
election year. Is he moderating
his speech to attract voters?”’

— “Ronald Reagan was the
oldest President to enter office.
Does (the power of the Oval Of-
fice to moderate its occupant)
weaken with the age of the
President?”

— “Or was the moderate
rhetoric intended as an attempt
to curb reprisals by an outraged
public?”

While McCaughrin agrees
that Reagan’s Speech contained
the fiery rhetoric and outrage
customary to the conservative,
he notes that the constraint
placed upon Reagan by the
limitations of the Oval Office
weighed heavily in the
moderate response.

“I don’t know whom Reagan
is listening to,”’ he notes, ‘‘but
the adviser doesn’t realize the
power of the arms talks. That’s
where it hurts. If we just let (the
downing of the plane) go with-
out any more action, (the
world) will forget about it. That
is why it comes back to arms

 

 

 

Professor Craig McCavghriv

“We're excusing their be-
havior, chalking it up to a sick-
ness, a military paranoia. No!
they’re dead serious about this.
It is not so much a paranoia but

control.”’

Interestingly, McCaughrin
points out that the end of
Reagan’s speech has given the
Democratic presidential hope-
fuls fodder for their speeches.
After noting the amazing lack of
silence from the Democratic
side after the mishap, Mc-
Caughrin said Reagan’s final
plea for greater defense spen-
ding and production of the MX
missile was misguided. “If
Reagan does fall victim to the
Democrats, it will be due to

domestic issues,’ predicted
McCaughrin.
“If nothing else, Ronald

Reagan has learned — and he
made it very clear in his
message — that the point in a
situation like KAL 007 is not
revenge. The point is to modify
Soviet behavior. They will shoot
down 10 more planes should
they fly in,”’ he said.

a well-grounded fear. They
have a flat terrain. Poland has
invaded Russia from the West.
The Mongols in the East. Now
there’s China to worry about.
We are fortunate in having
friendly neighbors to the north
and south and oceans as bar-
riers,” he continued. ‘Their
behavior is evil. The question is
whether their motivation is
evil.”

Prof. Craig McCaughrin
came to W&L in 1981 as an asso-
ciate professor of politics after
teaching at the University of
Pennsylvania. He holds a BA
and an MA from Wayne State
University in Detroit as well as
a Ph.D. in politics from the
University of Minnesota.

| Burglary,

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

In the wake of a rape and a
burglary at Washington and
Lee fraternity houses following
Rush parties last week, Lex-
ington Police Chief Lawrence
Q. Sutton said that the universi-
ty social atmosphere is ‘‘con-
ducive”’ to problems, and steps
must be taken to reduce the
likelihood of future alterca-
tions.

The rape victim was a
freshman from Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College, and
Chief Sutton said there is no in-
dication that her assailant was
a W&L student.

Law enforcement records
show that the crime occurred
about 3:45 a.m. last Thursday
at the Pi Kappa Alpha (Pika)
house at 106 North Main Street.

The nearby Phi Delta Theta
house was burglarized early the

same morning, and Sutton said

investigators ‘do feel there
may be some connection be-
tween the two. The inquiries are
being pursued jointly.”

Police are seeking a suspect
described as ‘‘a black male with
medium-brown skin, in his

At the time of the crime, he is

would describe for the record
only as “‘scientific investigative
methods.”’

Sutton said that “‘several
students who are believed to
have seen the subject have been .
reviewing photographs of
known criminals in Lexington”’
in an attempt to make a positive
identification.

He said that this technique
would continue to be used
throughout the course of the in-
vestigation.

Using the police report taken
about 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Chief
Sutton related the sequence of
events:

“The subject was sleeping by
herself in a bedroom on the se-
cond floor of the Pi Kappa
Alpha house. She was awakened
by an unknown black male
choking her.

‘“‘A member of the fraternity
in an adjoining room was
awakened by her struggling and
making noises. He then ejected
the subject from the house.

“The girl was treated at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital for
bruises and soreness of the
throat. She had been choked,
and she had lacerations on the
back of her head.

“The usual medical tests in
cases of this nature were per-
formed.”’

ROTC cadets finish
high at Ft. Bragg

By DAVID W. JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

A team of 26 Reserve Of-
ficers’ Training Corps cadets
from Washington and Lee took
top state honors at the 1983
ROTC First Region Advanced
Camp, held at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
during June and July.

During the six-week pro-
gram, the cadets competed with
teams from 111 other schools
and finished 13th overall, the
highest of the 11 Virginia col-
leges participating.

During the program the
cadets who had just finished
their junior year, received
training in a variety of fields,
including first aid, communica-
tions, orienteering, weaponry
and small-unit tactics. The em-
phasis, however, was on leader-
ship skills and the cadets’ abili-
ty to respond to field situations.

The exerciscs were the cul-
mination of years of practice
and training, said Capt. Bayard
T. Keller, one of the instructors
who helped the cadets prepare
for the camp. During their
training with the W&L ROTC
detatchment, Keller said, the
cadets were exposed to almost
everything the camp would test.

17 S. Main St.

Leadership skills, or job per-
formance, was the single most
important element tested. For
as part of this, the cadets were
required to command a unit
ranging from about a dozen to
over a hundred troops. The
leader had to take the cadets
through their daily routine and
any drills that might be re-
quired. This is vital Keller said,
because, should a cadet decide
to enter active service after
graduation, he will enter as a
second lieutenant.

Another major part of the ex-
ercise was a field experience
designed to test the cadets’
reaction to situations that might
be encountered on the bat-
tlefield. These could range from
wounded civilians to the death
of a commanding officer.

Land navigation and military
skills tests both counted as 20
percent of the cadets’ final
grade. During the land naviga-
tion test, cadets were required
to use a map and compass to
manuever in the dark, and the
military skills section tested
basic field tasks like gun
maintenance and radio opera-
tion. A physical fitness test also
accounted for 20 percent. A
riflery test accounted for 2 per-

cent of the final score.

Keller attributes the cadets’
success to their overall superi-
ority, citing standardized tests
and extracurricular activities
as indicators. Many of the tests
required advanced training and
study, in addition to a general
academic, knowledge of field
skills. Keller said the W&L
students are well prepared for

The Ring-tum Phi, September 22, 1983, Page 5

these trials.

The cadets trained for the
Fort Bragg exercise by taking
military science courses and
participating in regular ROTC
programs here, often held on
weekends. One of the most im-
portant parts of the prepara-
tion, Keller said, was a week-
end-long camp, held at Fort
Pickett in May, that simulated

many of the Fort Bragg exer-
cises.

In addition to W&L, top
schools included Johns Hop-
kins, MIT and Cornell, all of
which scored in the top dozen,
just above W&L.

The Virginia Military In-
stitute’s Keydets finished 80th.

~ Mock Con closes in on budget goal

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Although the 1984 Wash-
ington and Lee Mock Con-
vention is still nine months
away, the steering committee
and staff is closing in on raising
the approximately $100,000
budget for the quadrennial
spectacular.

At first glance, that figure
seems large, but convention of-
ficals estimate the Mock Con-
vention only will cost a max-
imum of $8 per Washington and
Lee student.

Mock Convention officals
presented a budget request of
$13,632 to the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night, according
to Michael Shelton, Convention

treasurer.

Shelton said the remainder of
the Mock Convention’s funds
will be raised through a variety
of methods, the biggest of which
is a Hatton Sumners’ Founda-
tion grant that will total $30,000
by February.

One arm ot the steering com-
mittee, the finance committee,
is responsible for raising about
$3,000 from major contributors,
such as corporations.

The individual state delega-
tions, however, serve as the big-
gest fund-raisers.

A total of $25,000 will be rais-
ed by the states, with approx-
imately $5,000 going to the
steering committee under a
complicated taxing formula,
Shelton explained.

 

>, .%, .%, .% .%, 4%

As of Sept. 15, Guam, under
chairman Charlie Alcorn had
raised the most money, $625,
followed by Texas with $450.

The states use their portion of
the money to build a float for
the Mock Convention parade
through downtown Lexington
and to conduct research in
order to predict accurately
which Democratic candidate
their state will support in the
actual convention.

Mock Convention officials ad-
mit they’re slightly worried,
though, because only eight
states have responded with any
contributions, and the total con-
tributions are just over $1,500.

‘‘We’re concerned, needless
to say,”’ Shelton said. ‘“‘But we
also don’t want anybody to

panic because we will be receiv-
ing a sizeable chunk of student
activities funds.

“T’m not sure that we have a
problem in that most of the
state chairmen are beginning to
set up their organizations and
familiarize themselves with
their states. We expect to see
some improvement in the over-
all picture.”’

Shelton indicated, that the
convention is probably about
where it was four years ago at
this time in terms of fund rais-
ing. About 70 percent of the con-
vention funds either have been
raised already or will come
from the student body tax and
the Sumners’ Foundation.

‘‘We’ve raised almost a fifth
of what we intend to spend,”’
Shelton said.

Fund raising activities thus
far have included sending let-
ters to previous donors and
former steering committee
members and state chairmen.

As money is contributed to
the Mock Convention, it is divid-
ed among the various commit-
tees according to the percen-
tage each receives of the
overall budget, Shelton expiain-
ed.

Those percentages range

from 18.1 percent for the
speakers and protocol commit-
tee and 12.1 percent for the
facilities committee to one per-
cent for each of the four
regional committees.

Senior Rob Massie serves as
comptroller and assistant
treasurer for the convention. In
that position, Massie ensures
that all accounting procedures
are correct.

Although the Mock Conven-
tion’s request for funds from the
EC is one of the larger organiza-
tional requests this year, the
convention receives less money
per student per year than many
other student organizations.

“It’s a well-endowed instu-
tion,’’ Shelton said. ‘‘And we
will make good use of our
money and none will go to
waste. Everything is budgeted
on a computer from now until
we pay our last bill.”’

The Mock Convention boasts
a success record of 12 correct
predictions in 17 attempts, and
the convention’s funding only
helps maintain those achieve-
ments.

‘‘After all,”’ said Shelton, ‘“‘if
it takes money to make it a suc-
cess, then it is a hollow func-
tion.”’

 

Crime

(continued from page 4)

Hospital officials called
police to report a _ simple
assault, and Chief Sutton learn-
ed the details of the case only
after he had arrived to take the
report.

The girl returned to Lynch-

burg later that morning.

The intruder was “thrown
down the stairs and left’’ out-
side by a Pika resident, Sutton
said. ‘‘It’s unfortunate that this
happened with students and not
an officer.

partying, so his thinking was
not up to par. He observed the
intruder in a compromising
position. He didn’t like what he
saw, but he didn’t know a rape
was taking place. I feel satisfied
with that.”’

The chief said that in a situa-
tion like this, the suspect should
‘“absolutely’’ be detained ‘“‘if
there are enough people to do it.
It may be the only chance we
have’’ to positively identify the
perpetrator of the crime.

“For the sake of decency and
respect for the girl,’’ the chief
asked that the name not be us-
ed. ‘‘I’m very protective of my
victims,”’ he said.

“‘She’s a hell of a decent kid,”’
Sutton said. ‘‘She came to a par-
ty to have a good time and this
happened to her.

“She’s not like some girls
who’ve been around for years
and make all the parties and
sleep around at all the houses.
She’s not one of those.

“She’s a very decent kid who
got caught in a very tragic
situation.”’

(continued from page 6)

In response to a query about
the victim’s condition, Ingrid
Montecino, Dean of Students at
Randolph-Macon and acting
Dean of the College, said terse-
ly, ‘‘Physically, she’s all right
under the circumstances.”

Montecino put a notice on the
front page of last Friday’s
“Sundial,’’ the student news-
paper which said that ‘“‘a R-M
student was assaulted at a W&L
fraternity.”

“Because the assailant has
not been apprehended,”’ Monte-
cino recommended in the paper
“that students do not visit the
W&L campus for several days
as a safety precaution.”

Lewis G. John, the W&L Dean
of Students, later telephoned
Dean Montecino ‘‘primarily to
ask about the girl’s condition. I
also let her know the case was
being investigated, and told her
that steps were being taken to
increase security at the frater-
nities.”

Dean John, who said he could

‘not recall another crime ‘“‘of

this nature” in his years with
the university, said that the
school was doing what it could
to cooperate with the  in-
vestigaiton.

At least one other university
official, who asked not to be
identified, said that he had pro-
vided substantive assistance to
police working on the case.

The robbery at Phi Delta
Theta is believed to have oc-
curred between 1 a.m. and 4
a.m. Thursday morning.

‘“‘We do feel it may be related
to the rape...because of the
vague description we have at
this time of the perpetrator of
both crimes supplied by
students who were eyewit-
nesses,’’ Chief Sutton said.

According to police records,
$40 in cash; $22 in undeposited
checks; eight identification,
bank, and credit cards; and a
wallet valued at $50 were stolen
from the bedrooms of five in-
dividuals on the second and
third floors of the Phi Delt
house.

Early the same morning, a
resident of the Sigma Nu house,
across Henry Street from Phi
Delt, was robbed of a cardigan
wallet, $24 in cash and five
cards.

John-Paul Bouffard, another
member of Sigma Nu, was
awakened at 2:30 that morning
“by my wallet being thrown
with a thud at the foot of my
bed.

“Someone was going through |
my drawers and wallet. I told’
him to put the stuff back, and he |
emptied his pockets. I then
chased him down the fire|
escape.”

Bouffard said he did not at-
tempt to apprehend the intruder |
“because I didn’t know if he had
a knife or anything. I had just}
woken up, so I was basically in!
a fog. My first instinct was,
‘You better put that back,’ and
he did.”

Because of the similarity of
the occurrences at Sigma Nu

 
 
   
    
  
   
   
  
     
   
  

 

and Phi Delt, Bouffard believes
the same people were involved.

‘I’ve seen photos of the rape
suspect, and I don’t think it’s
the same person. But it sounds
like they were working togeth-
er. They were obviously just go-
ing from room to room at the
two houses,”’ Bouffard said.

In a series of interviews,
Chief Sutton kept returning to
the atmosphere in which frater-
nity parties are conducted as he
sought to prevent another oc-
currence like that of last Thurs-
day morning from taking place
again.

“The ‘open house’ type of at-
mosphere in which these par-
ties are conducted is conducive
to this sort of thing,’’ he said.
“This relaxed approach is beau-
tiful in a way, but it is an invita-
tion to those who would take ad-
vantage.”

“If you make it a private par-
ty, you ask anybody who’s not

invited to leave, and if they
don’t, then they’re trespassing,
and you can call us,” he con-
tinued.

“Fraternity houses are sup-
posed to be closed, open to
members and guests only.
You’re not supposed to invite
townspeople and I don’t think
they expect to be invited.

‘“‘When you leave it open, and
then party to the extent that
your alcoholic consumption
causes you to fail to take
reasonable care of your valua-
bles and safety, you’re inviting
problems. It doesn’t mean
anybody has the right to do it,
but it will happen.”

Chief Sutton said that ‘“‘more
student interest was generated
in the burglaries because of the
rape across the street. We have
one or two reports of larcenies
every time there are parties.”

Sutton said he would value in-
formation from anyone who had

been involved in or had witness-
ed the crimes, but added that he
didn’t want the investigation
impeded.

The chief bristled. ‘I ap-
preciate any assistance from
anybody, but I will not tolerate
interference.

“‘T request that they help us to
help them.”’ He said this can be
done through ‘‘a few simple
methods,”’ including those that
Pika has instituted on his ad-
vice.

He also said that, surprisingly
often, students leave stereos
running even after the parties
are over, which he said is a
dangerous practice because it
makes the detection of in-
truders more difficult.

Sutton was unwilling to
discuss many details of the in-
vestigation, because ‘‘it is all of
evidentiary value and might
jeopardize the case before
trial.”

Sutton, who took command of
the Lexington police force on
May 9, said that it is fortunate
events of this significance have
not happened before.

“Statistically speaking, on a
national basis, it’s accepted
that for every rape that is re-
ported, ten go unreported,” he
said.

“I have no reason to believe
Lexington is any exception,
because of the atmosphere
here.”’ He emphasized, how-
ever, ‘“‘that doesn’t make Lex-
ington any worse than any other
city. I think Lexington is
dynamite.”’

Sutton offered a number of
solutions to the security issues
which have been raised in the
last week. ‘‘The students have
to protect themselves a little by
using a little discretion in the
protection of their property,”
he said.

Huntley says ‘no’

to congressional

By B. SCOTT TILLEY
Staff Reporter

Invoking the ‘Sherman
Oath’’ on his own behalf, former
Washington and Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley has ruled
out the possibility that he may
be a candidate in next year’s
Sixth District House of Repre-
sentatives race, despite being
approached by at least one in-
fluential Republican.

‘Politics and running for of-
fice have not and do not interest
me,” said Huntley, who has
returned to teaching law at
W&L.

Rumors have been cir-
culating within and outside of
the Republican Party that
Huntley would be a good can-
didate to try to win back the

Congressional seat the
Republicans lost in 1982 for the
first time in 30 years.

“If the rumor has_ been
started about me running, I
wish you would stop it. It’s not
true,” Huntley said, adding that
he has no interest in running for
elected office in the future.

Robert W. Goodlat, chairman
of the Sixth District Republican
Party, confirmed that Huntley
“had definitely been approach-
ed by a prominent member of
the business community here in
Roanoke,”’ but that Huntley had
responded with a firm ‘‘no.”’

TaCe

 

Robert E.R. Huntley

“It was a_ well-conceived
idea,’’ Goodlat said. ‘‘Many felt
he would be an excellent can-
didate...1 personally don’t
believe it will be pursued,
though, at least by the party.”’

The Sherman Oath is based
on Gen. William Tecumseh
Sherman’s 1884 pledge, ‘‘I will
not accept if nominated, and
will not serve if elected.”

Other names that have been
mentioned as_ possible op-
ponents to incumbent Rep.
James Olin include State Sen.
Ray Garland, former Attorney
General J. Marshall Coleman,
Del. Steve Agee and former
Del. Ray Robrecht.

Genovese

to lecture
tomorrow

Eugene D. Genovese, pro-
fessor of history at the Universi-
ty of Rochester, will deliver The
John Randolph Tucker Lecture
for 1983 at Washington and Lee
University’s School of Law
tomorrow.

The title of Genovese’s lec-
ture is ‘‘The Law and Slave
Society in the Thought of
Antebellum Southern Political
Economists.’’ It will be
presented at 4:15 p.m. in the
Moot Courtroom of Lewis Hall.
The lecture is open to the
public.

The Tucker Lectures were
established at Washington and
Lee in 1949 in honor and
memory of the distinguished
service of Mr. Tucker as dean
and professor of law from 1823
to 1897.

The first Tucker Lecture was
delivered by John W. Davis,
who served as Solicitor General
of the U.S. and Ambassador to
Great Britain. Subsequent lec-
tures in the series have been
given by distinguished lawyers,
judges and scholars, including
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F . Powell.

Two Washington and Lee
University students were

Sunday at about 2:15 a.m. as
they were walking west on
Massie Street, according to
Police Chief L.O. Sutton.

Senior Roger McDonough suf-
fered a broken nose and junior
Ed Buttarazzi received several
cuts and bruises during the
altercation, Buttarazzi said.

Buttarazzi said that he and
McDonough were walking home
from a party at Pi Kappa Phi
when they were approached by
six to eight black males who ap-
peared to be 25 to 30 years old.
Buttarazzi said they told the
men that they were not looking
for any trouble, but the men
started throwing punches
anyway.

“It was a totally unprovoked
attack,”” McDonough said.

After the assailants left the
scene, Buttarazzi and McDon-

ough walked the rest of the way
home. Senior Patrick Buttaraz-
zi, Ed’s brother, called the
police and a patrol car took the
two injured men to the hospital.

Soon afterwards, Patrick But-
tarazzi and junior Jim Noble
were driving to the hospital
when a group of men who fit the
description of the men who
assaulted McDonough and Ed
Buttarazzi blocked the path of
their car, Ed Buttarazzi said.
Pat Buttarazzi had to slow down
the car and manuever his way
through the men while some of
them were banging on the wind-
shield, Ed Buttarazzi said.

Noble and Pat Buttarazzi
reported the incident to the
police.

Ed Buttarazzi said that he
was disappointed that the police
did not immediately send out a
patrol car to try to find and
identify the members of the
group after his brother reported
the second incident.

“I don’t think the police
responded very well to it,” Ed
Buttarazzi said.

Thousands of Army ROTC graduates, from hundreds of

volunteer Army.

Some enrolled in ROTC for financial aid to complete col-

ROTC scholarships). Others for the management training
and experience offered by Army ROTC courses. Still others
for the positions of immediate leadership responsibility
following graduation, as officers in the active Army,

Reserves, and Army National Guard.

But most enrolled also to serve their country. Men from
the north, the east, the south, the west ... from small urban
areas. They've shown that you don’t have to be from Ten-

Law students have a variety of backgrounds

Who is becoming a lawyer
these days?

Bankers ministers and
newspaper reporters. House-
wives and engineers and in-
surance adjusters.

Those, at least, are a few of
the careers in which first-year
law students were working
before they entered the Wash-
ington and Lee University
School of Law this fall.

Statistics compiled by the ad-
missions office indicate that a

majority of law students, at
Washington and Lee at least,
still enter directly from college.
Of the 123 students in the first-
year law class this fall, 54 per-
cent (67 students) received
their bachelor’s degree in 1983.
The statistics indicate a
continuing trend among
students to take at least one
year away from the classroom
before beginning graduate
studies. For instance, 14.7 per-
cent of the first-year W&L law

students graduated in 1982 and
took a year off before beginning
law school while another 10.5
percent took two years off.

The remaining 20.8 percent of
the first-year class graduated in
1980 or earlier.

‘“‘My impression is that the
trend nationwide is for law
students to be older and that
many continue to enter from
other careers,’ says Edward 0.
Henneman, assistant dean of
the W&L Law School. “If
anything our statistics in this
regard are less dramatic than
those from law schools in large
urban areas.”

Yet, the W&L law school has
its share of students who are
embarking on new careers or
perhaps getting a law degree to
supplement a current career.

Among those students who
received their bachelor’s
degrees in 1980 or earlier, the

following
represented:

careers were

— a bank officer;

—a former press secretary
and speechwriter for a state
political official ;

— a minister who already
holds a doctorate in religious
education;

— an industrial engineering
systems analyst for a major gas
company;

— two paralegals from New
York law firms;

— a government reporter for
an Iowa newspaper;

— an agricultural research-
er;

— a radio station news direc-
tor.

“We do have a good deal of
diversity in terms of the careers
from which these men and
women have come but also in
terms of the academic interests
pursued by those students who

graduated most recently,”
noted Henneman.

While political science was
the most popular undergradu-
ate major among the first-year
law students, virtually every
course of study is represented
from music to art to geography.

History was the second most
popular major followed by
English, economics, business
administration, philosophy, and
journalism.

And that does not even in-
clude some of the varied ex-
tracurricular interests of the
entering students, who included
among their numbers a former
Atlantic Coast Conference
basketball player, the ad-
ministrator of a day-care
center, the coach of a national
championship equestrian team,
and a _ national champion
weightlifter.

And that’s who’s going to law
school these days.

Lloyd vs. city hall

 

Public hearing slated tonight

By BOB BRYANT
Special to the Phi

Lloyd Smith, owner and
manager of Lloyd’s of Lex-
ington, may be forced to close
the game room section of his
restaurant unless he is granted
a conditional use permit by the
Lexington City Council tonight.
There will be a public hearing
on the matter tonight at 8
o’clock in City Hall, 300 East

notified Smith that he was in
violation of a 1976 zoning or-
dinance which prohibits the
operation of ‘Public billiard
parlors and pool rooms, bowling
alleys, dance halls and similar
forms of public amusement,”’
without a conditional use per-
mit from the city.

‘‘When I opened, I went to the
zoning administrator, Paul
Buskey, and he said that I could

The legality of the game-
room section of Lloyd’s was
questioned last spring while the
Lexington Planning Commis-
sion was discussing a possible
game room ordinance. Accor-
ding to Building and Zoning Ad-
ministrator Donald Mette, ‘‘In
looking through the old records,
I found out that approximately
two years ago someone had
been denied a conditional use

put games in my restaurant
because I sold food and didn’t

After Buskey resigned Smith
went to his replacement,
Leonard Reis, who also gave his
assurances that he could con-

tional use permit. When Mette,

ed in 1980, notified Smith ot the
situation, Smith applied to the
city for a conditional use per-
mit.

Smith’s case was referred by
City Council to the planning
commission, which held a
public hearing Aug. 18 at which
Washington and Lee professor
Albert Gordon among other
spokesmen testified on behalf of
Lloyd’s. The planning commis-
sion voted at the conclusion of
the hearing to recommend to
the City Council that Lloyd’s
should be allowed to continue to
operate, ‘‘as is until we are able
to draft an ordinance.”’ Accord-
ing to Mette, the planning com-
mission ‘‘didn’t feel that the or-
dinance was definite enough,”’
so the recommendation went to
City Council, which then
scheduled tonight’s public hear-
ing.

Tonight is the second public
hearing that Smith has had to
prepare for, including gather-
ing signatures for a petition, in
four weeks. Says Smith, “If

Lewis) thought it was a do or
die situation,’’ he said. ‘‘The at-
tempts (to resolve it) were not

commensurate with the pro-
blem.’’: ~

Lewis and Matrazzo both said
that the decision was not a per-
sonal one.

“I bear them no personal
malice,’’ Matrazzo said.

Matrazzo also says he was
never informed officially of the
EC’s review of his appointment
and received no official notice

 

 

of the Executive Committee’s
decision until he saw a notice in
the EC minutes.

Howard, also the Executive
Committee secretary, said that
all three tri-chairmen will
receive letters from Jenevein
officially notifying them of the
rescission.

Lewis, Feldman and Matraz-
zo all agree that the tri-
chairmen arrangement was un-
workable.

“T don’t think any organiza-
tion can function with three
chairmen,” Feldman said.

The cause of the problems
seem to be a combination of the
tri-chairman format and a con-
flict of management styles.

“Ultimately there must be
one person at the top with the
final say,’ Matrazzo said.

Matrazzo said that the con-
flicting styles created a stress
at the upper level of the com-
mittee that filtered down into
the lower ranks. “Even now
that I’m gone, that stress re-
mains,’’ Matrazzo said.

Jenevein said, ‘‘The commit-
tee agrees the (tri-chairman)
format was tough to manage.
You have to have someone who
is ultimately in charge.”’

“If the Student Body (present
and future) is to gain anything
from this, it has to be discuss-
ed,’’ Matrazzo said referring to
the lessons he said could be
learned from the tri-chairman
format.

“‘Now that it’s happened, we
might as well learn some-
thing,” Matrazzo said.

The peripheral effects of the
shake-up on the Convention are
yet to be seen.

Haywood estimated that the
committee will be about two
months behind schedule, but
Lewis differs, saying that it
won’t alter the schedule at all.

Feldman said that the
changes will ‘‘probably hurt
morale at the beginning but in-
crease efficiency. I don’t think
it will have a devastating effect
on morale,”’ he said.

Matrazzo agrees, saying it
will only ‘“‘color things for a
short period of time.”’

Jenevein commented that
“for the Mock Convention to be
a success will require some
degree of resilience and renew-
ed motivation.”

“To lose one of the top
three...is potentially very
destructive,’’ he said.

Matrazzo did not seem bitter
although he admitted he is
disappointed.

‘My biggest concern is that
the convention go on,’’ he said.
“I do believe there are highly
qualified people out there who
can assume those positions
(vacated by resignations)’’ he
said.

“TI don’t want to burden the
convention by making an issue
of this,’’ Matrazzo said.

“There’s still a piece of my
heart in the convention,” he
said.

Lewis said that the commit-
tee has already taken steps
toward restructuring the con-
vention. But Howard observed,
“We're approaching the time
when we can’t keep making
these changes.”’
Sports ef
Polo lacks depth, looks to correct mistakes

The Ring-tum Phi, September 22, 1983, Page 13

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team finished fourth
in the W&L Fall Classic at the
Cy Twombly Pool last weekend.
The Generals (6-3) finished the
tournament witha record of 2-3.

W&L collected wins over the
University of Arkansas at Little
Rock and Johns Hopkins
University. The Generals lost
games to Navy, Bucknell and
Richmond. Navy won the tour-
nament with a 5-0 record.

Coach Page Remillard cited
Bobby Pearson and Tim Stan-
ford for outstanding play. Matt
Ravencraft led the scoring at-
tack for the Generals. Raven-
craft scored 15 goals during the
tournament.

Although the W&L B team
finished the tournament in last
place, Coach Remillard is very

. pleased with the play displayed

by the freshmen. ‘‘They played
beyond expectations. Our fu-
ture is bright if they continue to
improve at this rate,’’ he said.
Coach Remillard added, ‘‘The

freshmen possess the en-
thusiasm which is a _ prere-
quisite for continuing the
aquatic tradition at W&L.”’

Reflecting on the tournament,
Coach Remillard said, ‘‘We
knew that we had a weakness
going into the tournament but
we were not really sure how
well we could hide it.’’ Accord-
ing to Remillard, the W&L team
lacks depth. Coach Remillard
had to keep his starters in the
water for almost the entire
weekend. Players from other
teams could play hard knowing
that other players would be
substiuted for them regularly.
W&L’s players had to play
knowing that they would
receive very little rest.

Coach Remillard believes
that the physical and mental
fatigue of W&L players created
careless mistakes. ‘‘To show
our improvement, we must cut
down on our number of turn-
overs each week,” he said.
Remillard believes it is very
important that W&L steal more
balls than they give up in a
game. Remillard, however,

said, “All of our mistakes can
be corrected.”’

Coach Remillard hopes to
reduce the number of the
team’s turnovers by using a
new method of substitution. The
starting six players play the
first three minutes of the game
before being replaced by a se-
cond string of rested players
who will play the remainder of
the quarter. Remillard said,

“Everybody is going to get a lot
of playing time.”

Coach Remillard will test his
new method of substitution this
weekend when W&L particis
pates in the Northeast Varsity
Invitational. The tournament is
being played at Brown and will
include the top ten collegiate
water polo teams on the East
coast. In addition to W&L and
Brown, teams from M.1I.T.,

Harvard, Navy, Bucknell, Ar-
my, George Washington, Slip-
pery Rock and Richmond will
participate.

Concerning this weekend’s
competition, Coach Remillard
said, “If we win any game, I
will be ecstatic.’’ He concluded,
“If we do win a game, it will
probably be against M.I.T. I
think that they are in the same
situation as we are.”

A new lax era begins

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

After eleven seasons of filet
mignon lacrosse coaching, the
W&L community will be a dif-
ficult group to please now that
Jack Emmer is gone. Dennis
Daly, the new head lacrosse
man, fortunately has the at-
titude that will allow him to suc-
cessfully meet that challenge.

This past July 19, Emmer an-
nounced his resignation as the
Generals’ head coach to accept
a similar position at West Point.
The university named Daly as
his replacement in an an-
nouncement by athletic director
Bill McHenry on Aug. 5. Daly
began his W&L responsibilities,
which include an assistant pro-
fessorship as well, on Sept. 1.

Daly enters his new role with
great. expectations. ‘I’m confi-
dent of who 1 amas a coach, and
I know we’re going to put out a
very good effort,” said Daly.

Although he is still in the tran-
sition process, Daly is quite

pleased with his reception. ‘TI’

feel a lot of support, starting
with the players and continuing
throughout the faculty and the
college community,” reflected
Daly, who has been meeting
with players as well as begin-
ning fall lacrosse practice last
Tuesday.

In particular, the response of
the players has been very
favorable. ‘‘So far, the players
have given me all that I could
have hoped for,”’ said Daly.

Daly is a veteran college
coach of eight years and 24
seasons of experience in hockey
and football in addition to
lacrosse. Before coming to Lex-
ington, his lacrosse team at his
alma mater Amherst produced
that team’s best record in 12
seasons. Previous to Amherst,

Daly coached at Middlebury
where his teams earned three
NCAA Division III Tournament
bids ina row.

He plans no drastic changes,
but admits, ‘There will be a
transition period as they learn
my different terms,’’ Daly looks
to make minor defensive
changes and provide for a more
total team offensive plan.

The new boss has tremendous

friend from lacrosse camps in
the past, but there is no degree
of awe in Daly’s mind. Says Da-
ly, “I don’t have to build tradi-
tion here. I need to maintain it. I
feel confident we can do that,
and, perhaps improve over the
most recent seasons.”’

Daly advocates the Division

 

which competes in Division I, as
‘‘the best of both worlds.’’ As he
sees it, “As long as W&L can re-
main competitive and not
sacrifice our Division III
philosophy, I say, ‘Why not
(compete in Division I)?’.”’
Admitting that ‘competitive’
is a term that would have to
continually be evaluated, Daly
stated, ‘‘Our realistic goal is to
make the tournament, and as
long as that goal stays realistic,
I feel we can stay Division I.”’
With that in mind, W&L head
lacrosse coach Dennis Daly
looks expectantly at his first
W&L season, not short on con-
fidence. Although a tradition
may have ended on July 19,
1983, perhaps one began on
September 1, 1983.

start, directed the W&L offense
with the poise of a veteran, as
he completed 17 of 25 passes for
129 yards and two touchdowns.
Of Wilson’s performance,
Fallon said, ‘‘We had to be
pleased with the job he did. He
made some mistakes that go
with inexperience. But overall,
he was in control of the situa-
tion.”’

Fallon also had praise for the
remainder of his backfield.

“Gene Girard ran the ball
really well and Frank Surface
did a good job both on short
yardage running and with his
blocking,” Fallon said.

Girard, who took over this
season for departed All-ODAC
performer Chris Cavalline,
rushed for 79 yards on 18 carries
while Surface added 35 yards on
9 attempts.

In the first quarter, Emory &
Henry took an early 7-0 lead on
an eight-yard run by Henry
Ferguson, who had 106 yards
rushing for the day. The Wasps
increased their lead to 14-0 in
the second quarter when Greg
Woolwine carried it in from the
two-yard line. The score re-
mained the same until half-
time.

After their lackadaisical play
in the first half, the Generals
quickly cut the Wasp lead in
half as Wilson passed to tight
end Ian Banwell for a four-yard
touchdown early in the third
quarter. James White added the
PAT and the score stood at 14-7.

The W&L defense, led by
senior linebacker and co-
captain John Cole, shut down
the Emory & Henry offense in
the third quarter. Cole had an
outstanding day (10 tackles, 7
assists), as did free safety Tim
Janyska (9 tackles, 3 assists, 1
fumble recovery) and corner-
back Barry Thompson (5
tackles, 2 assists, 1 intercep-
tion).

Wilson struck again at the
beginning of the fourth quarter
as he hit Gene Girard for two
yards and a touchdown. White’s
kick was once again good, tying
the score, 14-14.

With less than four minutes
remaining in the game, W&L
committed a fatal turnover as a
bobble in the backfield on a
hand-off resulted in a Wasp
recovery at the W&L six-yard-
line. On the next play, Ferguson
scored his second touchdown of

Soccer shaky early, downed by EMC, 4-2

By PAUL FOUTCH
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team, suffering from first-
game-itis, according to Coach
Rolf Piranian, opened its
season Tuesday with a loss to
Eastern Mennonite, as_ the
visiting Royals took advantage
of early defensive mistakes by
the Generals and held on to win,
4-2.

Outshooting the Royals 27-12
for the game, Washington and
Lee dominated the scoreless se-
cond half, but the closest they
came to narrowing the gap was
a shot by freshman forward
Peter Van Son that grazed the
top of the crossbar with three
minutes left. Sophomore for-
ward Steve McGrath also had
two shots stopped. by royal
goalie Kevin Yoder in the se-
cond half.

“‘T thought we had a real fine
second half,” noted Piranian,
“although our shooting needed
work.”’

Piranian’s pre-game fears
that Eastern Mennonite, play-
ing in its fifth game of the
season, would have an adge in
experience came true, as the
Royals scored three unan-
swered goals in the first 18
minutes. ‘‘We certainly made
some bad mistakes, but that’s
going to happen in your first
game of the season,”’ said Pira-
nian.

The eighth-year coach also
warned that some changes in
the lineup could be made for
Saturday’s game at Averett. “It
looked like some players didn’t
want to work too hard for their
spots,”’ noted Piranian.

The Royals’ first goal came
when a mix-up between goalie
Jay Werner and his fullback

resulted in a 20-yard blast into

the net by Royal midfielder
Munir Abuznaid.

Four minutes later a center-
ing pass by the Royals’ Mike
Martin found midfielder David
Yoder, whose shot from ten
yards left Werner with no
chance.

Failure to clear the ball from
the Generals’ penalty box led to
a header by Mike Hurst that
gave the Royals a 3-0 lead at the
27:32 mark of the first half.

Numerous General forays in-
to Royal territory finally paid
off at the 22:06 mark when
senior co-captain Roland Simon
sent a 25-yard shot into the net.

W&L kept up the attack and
was rewarded with a corner
kick ten minutes later that
junior midfielder Jeff Reichert
headed home to cut the Royals’
lead to 3-2.

Eastern Mennonite finished
the scoring with 12 minutes left
in the half when John Wenger

Harriers
to defend

Crown

By RICK PIERCE
Staff Reporter

The defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champion
Generals prepare to defend
their title as their season opens
this Saturday at 11 p.m. The
W&L harriers will entertain
three teams, one of which
defeated the Generals last fall
(Mary Washington College).
The remaining two participants
are Washington College and
Newport News Apprentice
School.

Coach Dick Miller will once
again pull the strings in defend-
ing the ODAC crown. Miller in
his 32nd season at Washington
and Lee has built up an il-
lustrious record of 180 wins, 121
losses and 3 ties. Miller, who
was coach of the year in the
ODAC, attributes much of his
recent success to team depth.
‘“‘We feel we have quite a bit of
depth. We feel that we win most
of our meets because of our
depth. A team needs strong
depth because we don’t know
how each individual runner will
do from meet to meet. When one
individual has a bad day there
is always someone there to pick
up the slack.”

Depth, indeed. The Generals
are loaded with a full arsenal
again this fall. Senior Captain
Angus McBryde is back. Mc-
Bryde placed second a year ago
in the conference meet and is
W&L’s top runner. Another All-
Conference returnee is junior
Frank Pittman. Pittman placed
fifth in last year’s conference
meet. Other returning _let-
termen are senior Paul Chap-
man, junior Mark Penbrook
and sophomores Bob Glenn and
Ron Moody, who is currently in-
jured and will miss some ac-
tion.

Rounding out the rest of the
field are junior Ken Moles,
sophomores Tim Higgins, Jon
Elder, Eddie Goundry, and
freshmen Ted Myers and Ash
Andrews. The Generals are
deep again and look to possibly
repeat as conference cham-
pions with stiff competition
from Roanoke and Lynchburg.

Eller to speak tonight in chapel

Carl Eller, a former All-Pro
defensive lineman for the Min-
nesota Vikings, and Warren
Welsh, director of security for
the National Football League,
will present a drug education
program tonight.

Sponsored by Washington and
Lee’s department of athletics,
the program will begin at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel and will be open
to the public.

“Although the program will
be of interest to everyone, we
would particularly like to invite
the young athletes from the
area to join us for this presenta-
tion,’’ said William D.
McHenry, W&L’s director of
Athletics.

Eller, who is a chemical

dependency consultant to the
National Football League, will
relate his personal experience
with alcohol and drug abuse.

A star player at the Universi-
ty of Minnesota, Eller was nam-
ed to the NFL’s All-Pro team
five times and was voted the
Most Outstanding NFL Defen-
sive Lineman on two occasions.
He played in four Super Bowls
with the Vikings and was
selected for six appearances in
the Pro Bowl all-star game.

...Well, it looks as if the Soviet
downing of Korean Air Lines
Flight 007 is now going to affect
the world of sports. Before I
begin my tirade let me first re-
mind the conservative minds in
our number that politics and
sport do not mix well. (see
Olympics, Moscow, 1980, boy-
cott, failure). Nevertheless,

_ witness the brilliant (?) minds

of the California legislature who
unanimously (?) have passed a
resolution urging President
Reagan and Congress to bar the
Soviet Union from participating
in the 1984 Olympic Games in
Los Angeles. The theory is that
the Olympics are a political tool
for the Soviets, and to remove
that tool would serve as a just
punishment for their atrocious
act. Now, I’m not denying that
what the Soviets did was wrong.
That, I believe, is not the point.
If the Olympic Games have any
sort of political purpose (which
I extremely doubt), it is to bring
the nations of the world togeth-
er, not to tear them apart. Us-
ing athletic contests for
political purposes is to abuse
the rights of the participants.
Athletes are only political when
they are forced to be. This is
true of all athletes, Russians
most certainly included. The
downing of flight 007 should be
punished, but the punishment
should be doled out to those who
deserve it, not to innocent
athletes who would be the only
group truly hurt by such an act.
In the final analysis, I’m sure
all of us would rather the U.S.-
Soviet situation improve than
worsen. Banning the USSR
from our Olympics could only
make matters worse. Think
about it, Ronnie....

...Checking the colonnade, the
weekend proved somewhat dis-
mal on the results side, but
beyond that, there is cause for
optimism. In the pool, Page’s
polo players, although going
two up and three down at their
Invite, have to be pleased with

...Our jewel from Jersey has,
as promised returned to make
these proclamations on the

reps will be Dallas (East),
Green Bay (Central) and San
Francisco (West), with Wash-
ington and the New York Giants
as wild cards. The AFC reps
will be the New York Jets
(East), Cincinnati (Central)
and San Diego (West), with
Pittsburgh and Oakland as wild
cards. The Royal Soothsayer
explains, ‘‘Hey folks, it’s just a
shot in the dark the way this
league changes. Elway will
throw many INT’s if given the
chance...As the Mouth says,
Nebraska looks pretty invinci-
ble on the college grid, but for

guess I was wrong about Mil-
waukee, but even prophets

Pirate pitching persists.’’ The
Prophet appeared a bit drowsy
as we spoke. Perhaps, we ought
not to put our money down on
these guesses just yet. Then
again, he still has Sonny’s Halo

..A final word to the wise:
Make a point to see Car] Eller in

education not only in the
destructive powers of drug
misuse but also in the strength
of the human spirit...

Rush ——

(continued from page 1)

Dean Murphy also urged that
if any students were confused or
had some unanswered ques-
tions to come by and see him or
anyone else associated with the
IFC.

Overall, IFC officials are
pleased with Rush at this time.
Clark said that he felt the Rush
system at W&L was “‘pretty
successful.”’

‘Most of the fraternities will
find the freshmen they’re in-
terested in, and the freshmen
will find the fraternities they’re
interested in.”

Although there have been no
major problems with this year’s
Rush, some Rush rules regula-
tions were broken, according to
IFC President Emery Ellinger.

Ellinge, reported that mem-
bers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity entered the freshman
dorms during a ‘“‘no contact”
period, when there should be no
contact . between fraternity
members and anyone par-
ticipating in Rush, and illegally
took some freshmen to a party
in the country,

In response to the actions by
the fraternity members, the

IFC Judicial Board voted to put
the SAE fraternity on a one-
week probation, meaning par-
ties and other social activities
will not be permitted during
that week, The SAE’s punish-
ment goes into effect Sept. 29.

Another instance concerning
Rush rules being broken was
committed by the Kappa Alpha
Fraternity. According to Ell-
inger, some members of the KA
fraternity were caught
distributing ‘“‘Rush materials’’
to freshmen while in the dorms.
Although contact between
rushees and fraternity mem-
bers was allowed at the time of
the incident, offering any sort of
Rush material to freshmen is
forbidden Ellinger said. The
IFC Judicial Board decided to
fine the KA fraternity $100 for
their actions. Ellinger added
that he hoped the fine would set
a precedent for fraternities to
stay out of dorms, ‘“‘and that
any other action of similar
nature occuring would be
“dealt with harshly.”

Ellinger also wanted to point
out that there would be a 30

minute break (between the end
of the sixth Rush date (9:30

p.m.) and the time the rushees
could accept their bids (10
p.m.) this Friday night.

“The freshmen must be
brought back to the quad and
left there,’ Ellinger said. He
explained the reason for the 30-
minute delay was to help
“alleviate the probelm of
fraternities exerting pressure
on freshmen.”’

The responses among fresh-
men concerning the structure of
the Rush system varied. Those
students interviewed said they
all felt Rush was a valuable ex-
perience.

Another freshmen, Mark
Smith, described his Rush ex-
perience as ‘‘very hectic,’’ but
added, ‘‘I think it’s good.”’

Smith also explained that he
understood how some freshmen
could get ‘‘caught up in Rush.”
He said that a lot of rushees who
are ‘‘putting all their eggs in
one basket’ might not get a bid.
He added that fraternity Rush
was held too soon in the year
and that waiting until the se-
cond semester for Rush would
be more appropriate.

Yet Greg Lunsford felt dif-
ferently.

“T think it’s great,”’ he said.

Lunsford added that he was
glad to have the opportunity to
meet a lot of the upperclass-
men. ‘I know why they call it
Rush now,” he said.

Now, that’s just great, not on-
ly do we have locals kicking
students faces in, but the police
force threatens to do so as well.
Tensions are running high with-
in the W&L community and if
the police do not start keeping
rampant young locals in line, it
will only be a matter of time
before W&L students show

packs, that they will not be

waiting for ‘‘half an hour to 45
minutes,’’ for the police to go
and investigate where the
beating had occurred and the
gang was still gathered, Noble
asked the State Troopers what
was so funny about his room-
mates’ getting beaten up and
why didn’t they go to in-
vestigate?” One of the State
Troopers replied to Noble,

Although this letter is ad-
dressed specifically to this
year’s freshman class, what is
contained herein pertains to
anyone under the age of 19. It
has been brought to my atten-
tion, as student manager of the

about the Cockpit’s policy

In order to clear up the confu-
sion, allow me to reiterate the
Cockpit’s policy: Only persons
with proof of age (i.e. 19 years
old) may purchase and con-
sume beer in the Pit; this is
Virginia state law. Any student
drinking beer illegally (or hav-

Student Control Committee for
further discipline.
