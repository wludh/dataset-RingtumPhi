A walk through the Cities of Gold

By JOHN HAYWOOD
Summer Intern

The towering search light
beams will once again be cir-
cling high above Warner Center
announcing the 77th annual
Fancy Dress Ball on Friday,
March 2. The theme of this
year’s Ball, Lost Cities of Gold,
will take students and alumni
back to the wild and mystical
South American civilizations of
the fifteenth century.

The Student Activities Board,
with a budget of $70,000 and a
staff of 50, has spared no effort
in transforming Warner Center
into a panorama of Aztec,
Mayan and Incan cities and
festivals. This year’s decora-
tions are the most expensive
and spectacular in the Ball’s 77-
year history.

Mr. F.D. Arrives

ing to the entrance,

Mr. F.D. and his date will climb
along the falls of the Urubamba
river towards Lake Titicaca in
the Andes mountains of Peru.
Ancient myth claims that this is
where the Sun God created the
first Incan, Monco Capac.
Vegetation covers the rocky ter-
rain to the top of the waterfalls,
but a path has been carefully il-
luminated to lead Mr. F.D.
toward the ancient cities
beyond.

Gulf of Campeche

Passing through the en-
trance, Mr. F.D. will travel
north to the tropical forests

 

along the Gulf of Campeche.
Traveling past the ancient walls
of Vera Cruz, he can view Aztec
Lord Montezuma greeting and
giving gifts of gold to the newly
arrived Spaniards who are led
by the. famous conquistador
Hernandez Cortez. Moving into
Doremus, Mr. F..D. will pass the
columns of Quetzalcoatl, God of
Morning, who, while journeying
to the Yucatan, was mysteri-
ously murdered. As_ legend
tells, Quetzalcoatl rose into the
sky and became the morning
star of Venus.
Quetzalcoatl’s Journey

Continuing along Quet-
zalcoatl’s intended journey, Mr.
F .D. will find Doremus changed
into the rain forests of the
Yucatan Peninsula. He can
view the abandoned ruins of the
two great cities of the Mayan
era, Palengue and Chicihen It-
za. Doremus will be jumping
with the rock and roll sounds of
the Producers as well as the
memorable beach and soul
sound of the Chairmen of the
Board.

Child Sacrifice

A spectacular display of
Aztec architecture will be found
in the new gym which will be
transformed into the center of
Teotihuacan — the ritual city of
the gods. Towering pyramids
line the Pathway of the Dead,
which leads to the Grand
Pyramid of the Moon. The ex-
citing sounds of the 1930s and
40s, provided by Lester Lanin

ANNIE JO WHITE

and his Orchestra, will recreate
the festivesinging and dancing
which once began the ceremony
of Tlaloc, the God of Rain. The
customary child sacrifice,
however, may be excluded.

City of Teotihuacan

Ascending the balcony op-
posite the Pyramid of the Moon,
Mr. F.D. will climb the
Pyramid of the Sun, where he
can view the ancient city of
Teotihuacan. The great Wall of
the Gods lies before him con-
taining colorful murals of Aztec
gods including Tezcatlipoch,
God of Providence, Xiuhtecuht-
li, God of Fire, Tlaloc, God of
Rain, and Centeol, God of Corn.
Exotic and interesting enter-
tainers will display talents new
and old on the balcony.

Temple of Inscriptions

Passing through the rain
forests of Chiapas, Mr. F.D. will
find the classroom changed into
the secret chamber of the Tem-
ple of Inscriptions. Here lie the
ancient hidden treasures of the
Mayan civilization. Roomful of
Blues, playing the hottest
rhythm and blues, and the com-
edy of the Rev. Billy C. Wirtz
are sure toentertain.

Many surprises await the
festive crowd throughout the
evening. This trip through
South American cultures of cen-
turies past promises to be the
most spectacular Fancy Dress
in history.

Take an energetic librarian,
$47, a handful of students in
costume, and you have the
essential ingredients of Wash-
ington and Lee’s first Fancy
Dress Ball in 1907. Seventy-
seven years later this annual
event requires the talents and
efforts of 50 Student Activities
Board members, six months of
planning, a budget of $70,000
and an expected turnout of 4,000
people.

Miss Annie Jo White, a W&L
librarian, initiated the Fancy
Dress tradition when she threw
a costume party for a few of her
student friends, using proceeds
from a theatrical production.
Aware of her possibilities for
social stimulus during the
doldrums of mid-winter, Miss
Annie set out to make her
February event an annual af-
fair. Her efforts were at first
greeted with student indif-
ference, but her persistence
paid off and her “balmasque”’
soon gained enormous support
and enthusiasm from the entire
W&L community.

Each year Fancy Dress grew
in popularity and prestige. By
1919 its extravagance and
elaborate decorations were

1928 the affair received national
acclaim via The New York

highlights of that era are still

Fancy Dress has been inter-
rupted twice in its 76-year
history. It was discontinued
briefly during the war of the
early 40s and completely aban-

- doned for a three-year period

beginning in 1971. As The New
York Times reported that year:

“Perhaps, as one student
sighed, ‘it can be resur-
rected.’ ”’

dent Activities Board’s version
of Mardi Gras, and the re-
vitalized tradition has been
growing in strength ever since.

Thursday night

 

SpongeTones, Push to play Thursday in Evans

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

Thursday night of the 77th An-
nual Fancy Dress Ball will start
off with a bang. Evans Dining
Hall will feature two of the
South’s hottest bands — Push
and the SpongeTones.

Both bands have received na-
tional recognition by the enter-
tainment world. Push is a 10-
man band from Petersburg, Va.
Its high-stepping, foot-tapping
funk will warm the audience up.

Afterward, the SpongeTones
will take the stage in a revival
of the 60s British invasion. This
“Fab Four” will bring out even
the most timid of the crowd. By
the end of the evening, everyone
should be danced out, while
remembering that the weekend
has only just begun.

Push will begin about 9 p.m.
Thursday. The 10-man group
was discovered by Bill McGee
and brought to Fun Town
Records. McGee most recently
has worked with Evelyn King,
SugerHill, Ray Goodman and
Brown and the O’Jays. Push’s
first single ‘Running For Your
Love’’ was added to many radio
playlists throughout the
Southeast. Their recent groove
effort is a 12-inch single called
“The Wave.”’ It has been

featured by Billboard magazine
as a ‘‘Top Single Pick’’ in the
“First Time Around Category.”’
Billboard describes the ““Wave’’
as a “sassy dance number in
the Parliment/Funkadelic vein,
full of spunk and humor.”

Each of the 10 members of the
band is very dedicated to
music. In addition to the three
years the band has performed
together, each member has
seven years of musical ex-
perience. Also, each member

SugarHill gang. Rounding out
the sound and providing the
rhythm is a set of keyboards,
bass, drums, synthesizer and
percussion.

After Push has worked the
crowd through a seat set,
Ripete Records Recording Ar-
tist — the SpongeTones will
recreate the British invasion of
the 60s. Music from the Beatles,
Kinks, Doors, Monkees, Cream,

Puterbaugh said, ‘‘the grooves
on ‘Beat Music’ are aglow with
a forward-thrushing musical
abandon that recalls the glory
days of many of the most
familiar British Invasion front
lines, including the Beatles, the
Dave Clark Five, the Zombies
and the Who of ‘Anyway,
Anyhow, Anywhere.’

‘But the SpongeTones’ music

obeisance of mere revivalism,

State University. The group is
fronted by Calvin Dugger, who
is the lead singer and showman
who compels the audience into a
frantic frenzy. Dugger is back-

horn arrangement called the
‘“‘K-9 horn.” (Saxophone, tenor
sax, trombone and trumpet).

album three-and-a-half stars

track to a party so good it could
never happen in real life.”’

Fancy Dress is certainly the
party that is so good it could
never happen in real life.

The group started out as a
local Charlotte band that played
Beatles’ covers. Member Pat
Walter describes the group’s
basic feeling. ‘The Spongetones

started out as something we lik-
ed and has become more fulfill-

ing than I ever imagined,” he
said. ‘I enjoy playing the type
of music people really respond
to.”

A favorable crowd response
from the beginning led the
group to dig even deeper into
the 60s and emerge with a com-
plete mastery of the period’s
sound.

The group is arranged similar
to the Beatles. Pat Walters
plays keyboards as well as
guitar. Steve Stoeckel, the Paul
McCartney look-alike with
beard, plays the bass. Jamie
Hoover shares vocals with
Stoeckel and Walters and plays
the recorder and guitar.
Journeyman Rob Thorne is the
fourth fab and sets the tempo on
the drums. And if you're
wondering what the name
SpongeTones means, band
members say that ‘It means
whatever you want it tomean.”’

So Thursday should satisfy
the tastes of everyone concern-
ed. Rhythm and blues appetites
will be whetted by the dynamic
singing and stepping of Push
and rock fans will be pleasantly
reminded of the British Inva-
sion,

Lanin returns
to take the stage

This year the Student Ac-
tivities Board has selected the
Lester Lanin Orchestra for the
Fancy Dress Ball as the head-
line act. Lanin’s music has been
described as “the beat heard
round the world.”

Booked for engagements up
to five years in advance, Lester
Lanin’s bands have played for
the Astors, the Chryslers, the
DuPonts, the Fords, the
Mellons, the Rockefellers, the
Vanderbilts and the Whitneys.
A favorite of British Royalty
and American, Canadian and
European society, Mr. Lanin
played at the Monte Carlo Ball
celebrating the engagement of
Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier
of Monaco. One of his most
memorable engagements was
when he played at the wedding
reception in honor of Prince
Charles and Princess Diana.
Said a guest at the Royal Wed-
ding, ‘‘Lester Lanin could make
an earthworm want todance!”’

“I don’t play politics, I play

Lester Lanin knows what the
verb ‘“‘to party’’ means, and
partying with the maestro is a
treasured memory of millions
of people who have enjoyed
dancing to the Lester Lanin
beat from coast to coast and
overseas. His brightly colored
Lester Lanin hats, which he
distributes at each party, are a
famous trademark throughout
the world.

Lester Lanin loves life
—especially the life of a
bandleader whose name has
become virtually synonymous
with glamourous social events.

Producers stop by on their way to the top

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

W&L has watched the Pro-
ducers rise from their origins as
an Atlanta-based band to a
regional favorite and most
recently to national pro-
minence.

The Producers’ Van Temple
offers his view of their rise,
‘“‘Through all these years,’’ Van
said, ‘I’ve just sort of gone
along having a good time, and I
consider this band as lucky
—the right time and right place.
Somewhere in the back of my
mind I’ve always felt, ‘I think
that I’m capable of doing this,’
but it’s never, for me, been a
goal — it’s just turned out this
way.”

With the recent loss of their
CBS/Portrait recording con-
tract, Wayne Famous’ words
from June of 1982 seem to ring
true for the present. ‘‘Our goal
is: No matter what, if we stay
together, something good is go-
ing to happen to our band.
We’ve had our trials and
tribulations with the record
company, and ridiculous people
handling us we had to get rid of,
but no matter what happens or
how many mistakes we make, if
we stay together, that’s the
ultimate power because that’s
what drew all these people here
in the first place.”’

Two years ago the Producers
drew a small crowd of W&L
Students together on the base-
ball field after a lacrosse game.
Despite dreary weather, the
band coaxed the sun to come out
and won many new fans. A year
ago the Producers returned to
headline “Spring Weekend’ at

Wilson Field. Their set was.

even tighter than their last and
a new album ‘You Make the
Heat’’ provided a larger selec-
tion of songs. Band members
claim that W&L is one of their
favorite places to perform and
Fancy Dress should certainly
prove this.

The Producers are a group
that combines four unique per-
sonalities and experienced
musical talent into one of the
brightest pop bands around.
Wayne Famous believes this
certainly is true.

The combination results in a
tongue-in-cheek, humorous,
fresh, always accessible smart
pop. The band has the standard

ingredients ~— guitar, bass,
drummer and an unusual stand-
ing keyboard.

The unique keyboards are
traced to Wayne Famous (no,
it’s not his real name). Wayne is
probably the most unlikely look-
ing rocker this side of Robert
Fripp. He is best remembered
by his happy feet dancing and
his constant facial contortions.
His keyboards are unusual
because they are worn around

his neck. The instrument is an
Oberhein OBX 8 voice
polyphonic synthesizer with 32
programs. He designed this
complicated-sounding contrap-
tion and paid $5000 to have it
constructed. Wayne’s musical
experience began at the age of
16, when he was influenced by
classicist Powell Everhart.
Members of the band cite

 

 

Wayne’s workaholic tendencies
as their backbone during tours.

‘“‘We’re a band that’s always
been willing to work, and we go
wherever there’s a job,’’ says
Wayne Famous. ‘‘When we’ve
been on the road for. four
months and play someplace we
haven’t been in awhile, we’re so
tight it’s overwhelming! It
keeps us growing and it makes
us a real band in the minds of
the fans.”’

Before the Producers, Wayne
toured in 1978 with Ellen Mcll-
waine and then met Bryan
Holmes and Van Temple, who
were playing in a band called
Cartoon.

Van had just left a band call-
ed Terminus and Bryan had
opted for a change of scenery
after playing in a jazz-rock
combo for several years. Van

Temple plays lead guitar and
shares vocals with Kyle. At an
early age Van’s father recogniz-
ed his son’s “‘rock affinity”’ with
guitars and bought him a Les
Paul Special. During this time
Van’s musical influences rang-
ed from Clapton to the ever
popular Beatles, which is
reflected in the Producer’s en-
core of ‘‘A Hard Day’s Night.”
Bryan Holmes also was a
member of Cartoon. Bryan join-

ed Cartoon in an effort to reach
a wider audience and more
readily accepted music. Bryan,
like Van, also had a childhood
fixation, except his was for a set
of drums. Bryan uses space-age
electronic drums that resemble
pieces of slate. Bryan believes
that the band has grown a lot
over the years, which he
believes is reflected in the dif-

ference between their two
albums.

‘We'd only been together six
months or so when we wrote the
songs on the first one. They
came out very naturally, but
they have an innocent sound
about them. To me, the second
album reflects a mature band.
We’ve achieved a style we
simply didn’t have before.”’

The fourth member of the
Producers is the paragon of a

 

 

rock star. Kyle Henderson is the
youngest and probably best
known member. Kyle was once
a member of Whiteface, a fairly
well-known Atlanta band of
yesteryear. The group broke up
after a poor outing as an opener
for the Dixie Dregs and Sea
Level at a New Year’s Party in
the Fox Theatre. Kyle began his
musical experience as a cellist,
but has now grown to love the
bass. He cites his early in-
fluences as British Rock (Yes,
Genesis, ELP). Kyle shares
vocal chores with Van. He met
the other members one day at
an Atlanta bar. That day Car-
toon’s regular bassist was too
drunk to play, so Kyle jammed
with the band and was later ask-
ed to join the group. Kyle, Van
Bryan and Wayne became the
Producers in January 1980.
After an amazingly short
amount of time together the
Producers arrived in New York
in the spring of 1980. There, a
live audition for Tom Werman
(CBS Records) impressed him
so much he immediately signed
them to the CBS/Portrait label.
They entered the studio in
November and came out with
their first album. The Pro-
ducers’ first effort, sporting an
outrageously camp cover, sold
moderately well, with 30 per-
cent of the sales in Atlanta.

In order to make sure they
showed improvement before
entering the studio a second
time, the. Producers plotted
their fate more carefully.
Guitarist and vocalist Van Em-
ple summed up the group’s am-
bition before work on the second
album began:

‘‘We want it less slick, a more
raw studio sound — you know,
more like we really sound!”

“You Make the Heat’’ was
among the top five most added
radio albums in its first week of
release. The band’s vibrant
video of ‘‘She Sheila,” the first
single from “You Make the
Heat,” is aired on MTV. Later
that same year, the Producers
appeared on MTV’s New Year’s
Bash, which gave them the na-
tional exposure they needed.
The band has been together on-
ly four years but has achieved
what most bands do in their
lifetime.

Today’s new bands, especial-
ly techno-pop, are criticized for
never paying their dues. Groups
usually gain their respect in the
music industry by critical ac-
claim and constant touring. But
one segment of music that
doesn’t receive its proper share
of the lime-light and the
rewards (i.e. money) is also one
of the oldest. Blues is part of the
development of American
music that originated on the
southside of Chicago. Rhythm
and Blues has grown to in-
fluence many of the bands of the
British invasion, most notably
the Who and the Rolling Stones.

Several bands such as the
Nighthawks, the Fabulous
Thunderbirds and George
Thorogood have toured con-
stantly and received their share
of critical laurels in an effort to
+reak the blues curse. Yet the
recent success of Stevie Ray
Vaughn has brought hope to the
blues. His recent work on Band
Bowie’s “Let’s Dance,” and his
own album ‘Texas Flood’’ has
brought blues to the forefront.

Roomful of Blues is glad to
hear this news. They certainly
have received the hard-earned
respect of the critics. Their se-
cond album on Muse Records,
‘Eddie ‘Cleanhead’ Vinson and
Roomful of Blues” was lauded
by critics. The single ‘Friend of
Mine”’ was nominated for a
Grammy in 1983. Their third

Roomfnl:

A roomful of jump blues

album, “Blues Train,” with
Chicago shouter Bog Joe
Turner, was hailed as_ the
“comeback album of the year,”
by ‘Record Magazine.’ This
recent work has been niminated
for a Grammy in the category
of Best Traditional Blues
Record, along with fellow
bluesmen B.B. King and Stevie
Ray Vaughn.

Roomful’s recent single
“Please Don’t Leave’’ was
recommended by Billboard as a

 

    
     
   
   
 
     
    

  

the classiest acts in town. The
nine-piece ensemble traces its
roots to Rhode Island and was
founded in 1970. Every member
is a top-notch musician, both in
terms of soloing ability and in
ensemble contributions. Their
music is aptly named ‘jump
blues,”’ which is loosely defined
as black pop music of the late
’40s-’50s. It is music for happy
minds and thirsty feet.

The 90-minute set features a
steaming 60s soul segment, an

 

 

“Top Pick.’ The band is now
finishing their latest album at
the Cars’ Synchro studio, which
they hope will break the blues
curse for them.

So it is evident that Roomful
has the critical backing and
they certainly have paid their
dues. They have been touring
for 13 years averaging a
wearisome 225 nights a year.
Touring has fine-tuned their
solos and playing skills. The
concerts are where the band
has built its reputation as one of

equally hot sequence of New
Orleans-style R&B and several
songs that showcase the con-
siderable instrumental talents
of each individual musician.
The hottest spot of the night is
usually the jazzy instumental
duel between tenor saxophonist
Greg Piccolo and the band’s
secret weapon, 60-year-old
trombonist Porky Cohen. Every
show is a new challenge to the
band, but Roomful always
leaves ‘em dancing in the
streets.

‘‘Heart-stopping Boogie
Woogie, Honey-drippin’ Blues
and Wine Drenched Testimon-
ials concerning Women with
Large Legs and Good Ole’ Boys
that like to Wear Dresses,”’ all
add up to the music that Rev.
Billy C. Wirtz simply calls,
“WARP-A-BILLY.”

Born in 1954, the Rev. Billy C.
Wirtz has lived the blues and
music he sings. Billy never
knew his real mother and
father, although it is rumored
that he was the product of a late
night indiscretion between a
sorority president from
Tuscaloosa, and a member of
James Brown’s Horn Section in
the back of a '52 baby blue El
Dorado, somewhere near Myr-
tle Beach, S.C.

Billy was abandoned and left
to die in the men’s room near

C.W.’s Snake and Monday
Farm just across the Florida
line. Saved from a_ certain
death, Billy was found and
adopted by the Reverend
Nathaniel Hosiah (A.K.A.
Divinin’ Rod) Wirtz, an
itinerant Geechie Piano Player
and the Human Pin Cushion in a
traveling carnival. So traveling
with his step-father, the little
Reverend spent his formative
years selling plastic busts of
Kitty Wells and retrieving the
ping-pong balls in the Hoochie-
Koochie shows.

For the next few years, the
teenage Reverend traveled the

country by mo-ped living on
Kool-aid and vienna sausage
and playing his piano in every
little juke joint in rest areas
along the way.

Billy decided he needed a back-
up group to make the big time.
So after months of searching he
found them in Seattle, Wash., a
trio of midget Alaskan hookers
became the ‘“‘Dreamsicles” and
the new-legendary act was
born.

Although the group lasted on-

ly a short time, its success was
phenomenal, reaching such ar-
tistic heights as touring South
Dakota with Slim Whitman, and
once playing for an audience
that included a girl whose
cousin used to babysit for Bruce
Springsteen’s sister-in-law.
Unfortunately, however, the

group disbanded when all three
members of the Dreamsicles
became mysteriously pregnant
and then had the nerve to in-
‘quate that the Reverend was
somehow involved.

Billy’s career slid quickly
after that, and finding himself
down to his last $500, he was
forced to seek work as a male
go-go dancer in one of those
clubs. But as he was walking in-
to a club one night, he noticed
an okra colored leisure suit in
the window of a men’s shop next
door, and as he stared at the
leisure suit, he heard a voice
that said, ‘‘Billy, I want you to
buy that leisure suit and a
fashion coordinated shirt to go
with it.” Billy bought the leisure
suit, and then the voice said,
“‘Now I want you to go out into
the wilderness,’’ so the
Reverend hopped on his mo-ped
and drove out into the forest.
The voice said, ‘‘I want you to
climb to the top of the mountain
and look to the west, and verily
you will see a girl scout camp
below you, and now I want you
to expose yourself to those Girl
Scouts.”’

Six months later, upon his
release from the correctional
institution, Billy formed the
First House of Polyester Wor-
ship and Teenage Desire.

Today, Billy plays what he
calls “The Deviled Ham Cir-
cuit” (as opposed to the chit-
tlen’ circuit) rockin’ his life
away. So, for an evening of
Satisfied Sickness and Smokin’
Boogie Woogie be sure and
catch the Rockin’ Reverend Bil-
ly C. Wirtz.
