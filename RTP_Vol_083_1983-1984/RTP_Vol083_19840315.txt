Dalton and White
elected in runoffs

Posters cause election controversy

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Sophomore James White was
elected Executive Committee
vice president and junior Sam
Dalton secretary during last
Thursday's ‘‘Big Three’ run-
offs.

The election was not without
controversy, though. Despite
complaints from the law school
during Monday night’s two-and-
a-half hour EC meeting regard-
ing the activities of temporary
Voting Regulations Board co-
chairman Jim Green, upper-
class law representative to the
EC, the EC voted to stand
behind the election results.

Committee votes to keep 12-12-6

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

The faculty calendar commit-
tee voted Friday to retain the
12-12-6 undergraduate academ-
ic calendar but to recommend
several changes to President
Wilson and the faculty as a
whole.

After voting 7-1 to keep the
12-12-6, the committee voted to
extend class periods five
minutes to 55 minutes each, to
establish a one-week vacation
after six weeks of the fall term
and to require returning
students to register for the en-
tire following academic year in
the preceding spring.

The committee delayed until
tomorrow action on whether to
eliminate or shorten the one-
week Thanksgiving vacation. A
motion was made to eliminate
the break, and “‘it’s my opi-

nion... that it would have pass-
ed,’’ said senior Lee Feldman, a
student representative to the
committee. Feldman managed
to have action delayed for a
week so he could appear before
the Executive Committee Mon-
day night and attempt to
discern student body opinion.

The EC voted 10-01, with
junior representative Cole
Dawson abstaining, to support a
week-long Thanksgiving vaca-
tion.

Feldman and the other stu-
dent representative, Rob
Woods, conducted a poll of
students Feb. 20-24. Of the 165
responses, Feldman said, 140
students favored the 12-12-6, 19
opposed it and six had no opi-
nion.

The EC voted to conduct
another poll on all proposed
calendar changes in conjunc-

tion with class elections Mon-
day.

About 70 percent of the facul-
ty surveyed last term also
favored the 12-12-6, Feldman
said.

One of the major faculty com-
plaints about the current calen-
dar is that classes don’t meet
often enough, Feldman said.
The lengthening of classes to 55
minutes would effectively add
another three class periods onto
the term.

Classes would begin every
hour on the hour and end at five
minutes until the hour. The last
class, which is now ‘‘J’’ hour,
would end at 5:55 p.m.

The committee voted to add
the October week vacation
because, Feldman - said,
“students, they felt, needed a
break after six weeks, especial-
ly freshmen.”

‘“! didn’t think a week was

necessary,’’ Feldman added. ‘‘I
thought a three-day weekend or
a four-day weekend would be
sufficient. The faculty felt a
week would be better because it
would give them more time to
work on mid-term grades.”’

When Feldman told the EC of
the October break and the
possibility of eliminating
Thanksgiving vacation,
Dawson said, ‘‘That’s ridicu-
lous. It’s not a state school, and
people come from so far away. I
think under the present system,
we have too many breaks.”’

Having voted to recommend
the October break, the commit-
tee had to either shorten
Thanksgiving break or decide
to start classes earlier or finish
them later, Feldman said. ‘‘The
Thanksgiving break is needed
but not necessarily a week-long
break,’ he added.

law representative last year,
said many law students were
upset about a letter White used
in campaigning on the under-
graduate campus and about
Green's involvement in taking
down copies of that letter posted
in the law school by someone in
opposition to White.

‘‘T don’t think he (Green) has
shown himself to be indepen-
dent,”’ Sicilian said. ‘You peo-
ple failed to discharge your du-
ty to get someone who was in-
dependent,’ he added, refer-
ring to the EC’s inability to ob-
tain a VRB chairman to replace
Burns Newsome, who is not at
Washington and Lee this
semester.

Law student Jeff Reese and
freshman Chris Carter were
named VRB co-chairmen by the
EC Monday night.

In the meantime, though,
Green and secretary Jim
Messer had been designated co-
chairmen of the VRB. When this
was announced two weeks ago,
Pete Baumgaertner, White’s
opponent in the runoff, pro-
tested, saying Green had been
campaigning in the law school
for a particular candidate and
that his presence at the polls
would remind voters -of that
candidate.

At that meeting, Green pro-
mised, ‘‘From this point on, |
can assure you I will be totally
oblivious, or neutral, to the pro-
ceedings.”

“IT believe I remained objec-
tive,’ Green asserted Monday
night.

“T don’t believe you did,”
responded Sicilian in what was
at times a heated exchange

Sicilian based his complaints
on the fact that Green took
down Xeroxed copies of White’s
letter that were posted in the
law school. White said he did

Review and Outlook

The Lure of Change

The primary purpose of the faculty calendar com-
mittee, formed last fall, was to study the effec-
tiveness of the undergraduate calendar and to recom-
mend potential changes to the rest of the faculty.

After concluding, and rightly so, that Washington
and Lee should retain its unique 12-12-6 calendar with
the short spring term, the faculty committee ap-
parently couldn’t resist the lure of change.

As reported to the student Executive Committee
Monday night, these changes range from the sensible
to the ludicrous. At the former end of that spectrum is
the proposal to extend classes to 55 minutes each. At
the latter is the proposal to require students to attend
classes Thanksgiving week, and, even worse, on
Thanksgiving Day. It is indeed alarming that one pro-
fessor even suggested a University-wide Thanksgiv-
ing dinner.

While we are disturbed that the faculty sees any
need to change the calendar, we do understand the
need for longer class periods, a brief break in the mid-
dle of October and perhaps a shortened Thanksgiving
vacation.

With this in mind, we support the plan suggested at
Monday’s EC meeting that student representative

_ Lee Feldman has said he intends to present to the
‘faculty committee tomorrow. This would call for no
' classes on the Monday and Tuesday following the
sixth week of school in the fall and no classes on the
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of Thanksgiving
week.

The two days in the middle of October would pro-
vide professors a chance to work on mid-term grades
and give students a breather from the rigors of
academic work. Ten weeks without break, which
students face under the present calendar, is a long
time, particularly for freshmen.

Shortening the Thanksgiving break to three days
and a weekend, meanwhile, would allow students who
so desired to go home for the holidays and also would
eliminate the seeming waste of a week’s vacation so
close to Christmas.

This faculty committee seems to have taken stu-
dent opinion into account when deciding to recom-
mend keeping the 12-12-6 calendar. We hope it does
not act with too much haste and continues to keep stu-
dent opinion in mind when considering these other
calendar issues.

Juan Valdez needs you

To the Editors:

The situation in Nicaragua is
extremely critical at this time.
The Nicaraguan economy
which depends heavily on only a
few agricultural exports has
been under increasing attack
from CIA-backed counter-
revolutionaries. Several hun-
dred million dollars worth of
damage has already resulted
from attacks such as the one
against the vital oil storage
facilities at the port of Corinto
last October.

Nicaragua needs a successful
coffee harvest to be able to pur-
chase basic food stuffs,
medicines, spare parts for in-
dustry and transportation, and
oil. Because of the urgent
political and military situation,
many Nicaraguans have been
mobilized in the defense of their
country and cannot participate
in the December-February cof-
fee harvest this year.

That is why I have chosen to

respond to Nicaragua’s call for
international work brigades to
ensure a _ successful coffee
harvest this year.

_ In the United States, the Na-
tional Network in Solidarity
with the Nicaraguan People
(NNSNP) is working to coor-
dinate volunteer participation.
U.S. citizens have a particular
role in this harvest, because if it
were not for our government’s
open attempts to overthrow the
government of Nicaragua, the
Nicaraguans would be free to
develop their own political life
and their own economy in
peace.

By participating in the
volunteer coffee harvest, I hope
to show that, as an American
citizen, I stand with the people
of Nicaragua in their moment of
need and that I oppose the
policies of the Reagan ad-
ministration. I urge others to
support and write to NNSNP for
further information on how to

Phi Delt member
responds to rumor

To the Editors:

In a recent letter to the SAC
from Sigma Nu concerning the
Fancy Dress weekend bombing
of their house, the members of
Sigma Nu referred to Phi Delt
as not being able to discipline
its members. They referred to
the incident as_ potentially
dangerous and they found a
lack of maturity, discipline, and
gentlemanly conduct among the
members of Phi Delt. Although
I agree on the lack of maturity
of those involved and the poten-
tial danger of this act, I
adamantly disagree with the
accusation of not being able to
discipline members. The acts of
a few in this case are not
representative of the majority.
The members of Sigma Nu
seem to think that Phi Delt took

a vote on this guerilla act of war.

at a house meeting.

To get to the point of this let-
ter, I would like to clarify one
point. In no way was I involved

in the.occurrence last weekend
at Sigma Nu, although’ my
name was brought up by some
Sigma Nu super-sleuth as hav-
ing stolen the simulator from
ROTC. I would not mind so
much if someone had been
enough of a man (or gentle-
man) to confront me with these
accusations.

Until the members of Sigma
Nu can discipline themselves
and rise to the level of maturity
and gentlemanly conduct that
they expect of everyone else, I
suggest that they take a long
look at themselves before con-
demning others.

In closing, I have some
guidelines for the members of
Sigma Nu: 1) A man is innocent
until proven guilty, 2) Get the
facts first - Perry Mason is just
a TV show, 3) Leave the rumors
to the National Enquirer, 4)
Grow up.

- Lawyers outline grand jury witness rights

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

Local lawyers adopted a
resolution Monday that outlines
the rights of witnesses who ap-
pear before the special grand
jury investigating area drug
trafficking.

The Rockbridge County-
Buena Vista Bar Association
also voted to name a five-
member committee to study
“‘the orderly administration of
justice in Rockbridge County.’’

The actions follow complaints
from a number of Lexington at-
torneys concerning Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly
C. ‘John’ Read’s operation of
the special grand jury, which is
now in its fifth month.

The panel’s 18th session is to
be held tomorrow. A Hollins
College student and two
students from Southern
Seminary Junior College are
among those scheduled to
testify.

The resolutions were approv-
ed during a three-hour private
meeting held at a: Buena Vista
restaurant.

Bar association president J.

Todd Jones said Monday after
the meeting that 20-25 members
attended, including Read, who
was present for the entire ses-
sion

Read has said that he will not
comment on any aspect of the
special grand jury.

Monday afternoon’s session
of Circuit Court was delayed
because of the length of the
lawyers’ meeting. The judge,
clerk, bailiffs, defendants and
their witnesses all sat idly in the
courtroom for over two hours.

‘‘We didn’t have any law-
yers,”’ recalled Clerk Bruce D.
Patterson.

Jones said that the resolu-
tions were ‘‘the collective effort
of the unofficial group that has
been meeting and discussing’’
the special grand jury.

It was that group of 12
lawyers which had formally
asked Jones to place discussion
of the investigative panel on
Monday’s agenda.

Jones said that the informa-
tion regarding the rights of
those subpoenaed by the special
grand jury was being dissemi-
nated ‘‘to straighten up the con-
fusion”’ about the panel.

The resolution said the bar
association was delineating the
legal principles ‘‘in order to
fulfill its obligation to inform
the public on this issue.”

‘*...Members of the Bar have
received inquiries from citizens
about the proper legal inter-
pretations of certain pro-
cedures employed by the
Special Grand Jury now in ses-
sion,’’ the statement said.

grand jury must warn each
witness that he need not answer
questions or produce evidence
that might incriminate himself,
that he may have his own
lawyer present during his ap-
pearance and that he may be
called to testify in later cases

tion.

The resolution listed seven
points on which the lawyers
wanted to ‘‘inform the public’:

Committees help solve financial problems

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

The Student Financial Rela-
tions Committee, better known
as the ‘‘cold check committee,”
and the Student Loan Commit-
tee assist students at Washing-
ton and Lee in meeting financial
problems. While very little
media coverage has been given
to them so far, both committees
are important in maintaining a
strong financial understanding
between W&L students and Lex-
ington merchants.

“The Committee pretty much
makes loans to those students
who find themselves in emer-
gency situations,’’ said Charlie
Sherrill, Chairman of the Stu-
dent Loan Committee. This
year, 28 students have received
a total of $2,505 in loans from
Sherrill.

The cold check committee,
which is only related to the Stu-
dent Loan Committee in that
they both report to the Ex-
ecutive Committee, is responsi-
ble for paying checks bounced
by students. In describing the
purpose of the cold check com-
mittee, Chairman Gil Dukes ex-
plained, ‘‘If it wasn’t for us, the
merchants would be a little
more hesitant about taking
checks from W&L students.”’

When a bank returns a stu-
dent’s check to a local mer-
chant, the merchant will submit
the check to the bank a second
time. If the check is again
returned, it is mailed to the
University, Dukes explained.

Every Wednesday, Dukes and
the other nine members of his
committee go through the re-
turned checks, which have been
written to local merchants.
From the Committee’s own
checking account, which is
totally independent from the
University, the merchants are
repayed, and the students are
called in to appear before the
committee, according to Dukes.

“We probably go through
about ... 10 people every Wed-
nesday night,’’ said Dukes.
‘Sometimes they skip the meet-
ings. If it is an unexcused
absence, we’ll fine them more,”
he continued.

During a student’s tenure at
W&L, a file of his appearances
before the committee is main-
tained. For an offense that is
not the student’s fault, such asa
bank error, there is no fine.
Otherwise, a student may be
fined up to ten dollars for the
first offense, twenty for the se-
cond appearance, and thirty for
the third, Dukes said. ‘‘We use
our judgment,’ said Dukes. The
committee discusses and votes
on each fine.

One of the committee’s big-
gest problems is dealing with
students who have overdrawn
their accounts and and left
school, Dukes said. The com-
mittee now has about 50 checks
from such students. ‘‘We’ve got
a hold on their transcripts,”
says Dukes in reference to these
students. ‘“‘If they need their
grades, they must pay us.”’

Students who continually

refuse to appear before the
committee are sent to the Stu-
dent Control Committee. ‘Only
one time this year have we had
to send them to Student Con-
trol,” says Dukes. Student Con-
trol may threaten students with
suspension and normally will
impose an additional fine.

While the Student Financial
Relations’ checking account
becomes larger and smaller ac-
cording to the time of the year,
it has not received any EC
money this year, according to
Dukes.

While the Committee does
cover for checks overdrawn by
students, it does not pay fines
charged by the bank.

“Some merchants don’t deal
with us because we don’t pay
fines,’’ said Dukes, who cited
one merchant who expected two
dollars for an overdrawn check,
plus $10 for the bank’s service
charge, which the committee
would not pay. According to
Dukes, most merchants try to
straighten out the situation with
the student before contacting
the committee.

The Student Loan Committee,
in contrast to the cold check
committee, does receive EC
funds and works through the
business office. According to
Sherrill, loans are usually for 30
days with a $300 maximum
limit. All loans are interest free.

“I’d say we have a pretty
good turnover rate,’’ says Sher-

rill, whose committee currently
has 18 outstanding loans. Of
these, seven are overdue from
last academic year, four are
overdue from this school year,
and the remaining seven are not
yet due, for a total of $2,291
outstanding.

“Of the 11 overdue, eight of

them are on campus,”’ says.

Sherrill, who has run into the
same problems as Dukes con-
cerning students who have left
the school.

“For those loans that have
been past due for a while ... I
have the authority to put a hold
on their transcripts,” says
Sherrill. This is normal policy
any time a student leaves the
school before paying any money
due.

According to Sherrill, loans
are based on emergency situa-
tions such as a_ student’s
needing money to pay a heating
bill. Sherrill noted one instance
where a student’s ROTC check
didn’t come in, and the student
needed money for the month.

While Sherrill has had to turn
down some loan requests, there
have not been any complaints
about the committee this year.
There is nothing in writing that
could hold down the credit
rating of students who have
received loans, according to
Sherrill. Thus, there are no
limitations on how a student
who has received a loan spends
the money he has.

because revelations regarding
the use of cocaine could involve
federal statutes.

eThe transcripts of the ses-
sions ‘‘are for the sole use of the
Special Grand Jury” and must
be kept sealed. They cannot be
opened except in the event of a
perjury prosecution.

eThe report filed by the
spécial grand jury at the con-
clusion of the investigation ‘‘is
sealed and not open to public in-
spection other than by order of
the Court.”

*The protection received
from a grant of immunity ‘‘may
be totally dependent on the con-
tent of the record’’ kept of the
session. Witnesses ‘‘should be
certain that all of their com-
ments are being properly noted
and recorded.”’

e‘‘Before a person can be held
in contempt for failure to
answer a question, he is entitled
to a hearing before a Judge.”’ If
the question is upheld but the
judge ‘‘finds the refusal to
answer was reasonable, the
witness is usually given an op-
portunity to give the answer”’
without penalty.

The resolution, which Jones
describes as being ‘‘educational
in nature,’’ does not address the
issue of whether the Virginia
immunity statutes applying
specifically to drug investiga-
tions are applicable to the
special grand jury.

“That is such a complicated
issue that no one was willing to
bring up that question,” said at-
torney Larry Mann. ‘‘The law
hasn’t been tested, or tested
enough, for us to be comfortable
saying exactly what the law is.”’

The second resolution passed
by the bar Monday directs
Jones to appoint a committee of
five members of the bar to
prepare a report and recom-
mendations.

The purpose of the committee
is ‘‘to settle the apprehension
and controversy and to promote
respect for the law and the
equal enforcement of the law.”’

The special grand jury is not
mentioned by name in the
resolution.

The committee is directed to
consult with members of the
bar, law enforcement person-
nel, the courts and citizens in
preparing the report.

Jones said he has not yet
selected the committee and
declined to specify a time frame
for the likely submission of the
report.

In last Thursday’s session the
special grand jury heard
testimony from officials of state
agencies and drug rehabilita-
tion programs.

The witnesses came from
Richmond, Roanoke, Win-
chester and Annandale. Includ-
ed were state Deputy Attorney
General Donald C. J. Gehring
and a member of the staff of
Gov. Charles S. Robb.

Phi Delts penalized for Sigma Nu incident

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

An incident involving two Phi
Delta Theta sophomores and
the throwing of an artillery
simulator at the Sigma Nu
house on March 3 has resulted
in two weeks’ social probation
for Phi Delta Theta and several
additional penalties for the
students involved.

Dean of Students Lewis G.
John confirmed that the two
students have received four
weeks of social probation and
will not be allowed to live in the
fraternity house during spring
term.

They also must pay to repair
damages caused to the Sigma
Nu house, make a personal at-
tempt to repair the damages
and make a personal apology to
the members of the Sigma Nu
house.

A member of the Student Con-
trol Committee, which deter-
mined the punishments against
the individuals Tuesday night,

confirmed that the two students
were Frank Surface and James
White.

White is a sophomore repre-
sentative to the Executive Com-
mittee and the vice president-
elect of next year’s EC.

The SCC member said the in-
dividual penalties were ‘‘proba-
bly the harshest thing we could
do short of suspension. I con-
sider it a pretty stiff penalty.”

Although Surface said he
thought the SCC decision ‘‘was
a little too harsh,” he added,
“I’m accepting my _ punish-
ment.”

White was unavailable for
comment.

Phi Delta Theta, meanwhile,
was fined $150 by the Inter-
fraternity Council March 6 and
given two weeks of social proba-
tion by the Student Affairs Com-
mittee on March 9.

The SAC, which automatical-
ly reviews all IFC Judicial
Board decisions, ‘‘felt the ac-
tion involved a greater penalty

for the fraternity than the IFC
recommended,”’ said John, who
is chairman of the SAC.

“Sigma Nu wrote a memo
outlining their position and
their feeling that some stronger
penalty should be ascribed,”
John added.

Phi Delta Theta could have
appealed the penalties to the
SAC at its meeting yesterday
afternoon but chose not to do so,
according to President Rey-
nolds Thompson, because ‘‘we
just wanted to lay the issue to
rest.”

According to information
gathered from various wit-
nesses and from a report filed
with the Lexington Police
Department, the incident oc-
curred about 5:30 p.m. Satur-
day, March3.

James Farquhar, a fresh-
man, said he was picking up
beer cans from Sigma Nu’s
front yard when he saw the ar-
tillery simulator thrown from
the front yard of the Phi Delta
Theta house.

The simulator, a cylindrical
object that creates smoke and
noise and is used by the military
to simulate battlefied condi-
tions, landed about five to 10
feet away from him, Farquhar
said, and rolled about 10 to 12
yards away before exploding.

Kearup said the shock from
the explosion broke two window

from the Sigma Nu house.

Some members of Sigma Nu
went over to the Phi Delta
Theta house immediately after-
ward, Bearup said, and the
members of Phi Delta Theta of-
fered to pay for the damage.

Bearup also called the Lex-
ington Police Department. Sgt.
Richard S. Rice, who answered
the call, said he wanted the
fraternities to settle the issue
between themselves, according
to Bearup.

Chris John, president of
Sigma Nu, said that Surface
came to the Sigma Nu house the
following night to apologize for
the incident and that Phi Delta
Theta paid $50 toward the
damages then. John said the
damages will amount to more
than that.

Farquhar said he suffered
some ringing in his ears follow-
ing the incident, but that it went
away. He went to the W&L in-
firmary to ensure that there
was no permanent damage.

“Looking back at it,’’ Far-
quhar said, ‘“‘they apparently
didn’t know I was standing
there (when the simulator was
thrown).”’

Surface said he _ thought
everybody had gone inside the
Sigma Nu house before the
simulator was thrown.

Lt. Col. David Fowler, chair-
man of the W&L military
science department, said an ar-
tillery simulator, about four
inches long and one inch wide,
could cause injury if it came in-
to contact with someone be-
cause there would be danger of
a “flash burn’’ caused by the
heat generated.

Although the W&L ROTC unit
uses them on training opera-

tions to simulate mortar or ar-
tillery fire, Fowler said, they
are only issued to the cadre (ac-
tive officers) and a selected
group of seniors trained in their
use. Up to 60 artillery simula-
tors could be issued for a two-
day exercise, Fowler said, and
the unused ones are returned.

Based on the federal stock
number of the simulator used in
the incident, ‘‘we have unof-
ficially determined that this one
did not come from us,’’ Fowler
said.

John, who said he talked with
both students last week, said,
‘‘My understanding is that it
was purchased out of state
some place.”

Lexington Police Chief L.O.
Sutton said Rice filed a report
on the incident late last week.

Sutton said that unless Sigma
Nu wanted to press charges,
that would be the extent of the
police department’s involve-
ment.

“My investigation is com-
plete. There’s nothing further
for me todo,”’ he added.

Chris John said Sigma Nu
would decide at a _ house
meeting Sunday whether to
take further action against
either Phi Delta Theta or the in-
dividuals.

John said he personally was
satisfied with the SAC decision
but that ‘‘there are mixed reac-
tions to it’’ and the SCC decision

among the other house
members.
The SCC deliberated for about

an hour before making a deci-
sion Tuesday night, said the
member, who added, “The
police consideration was men-
tioned a couple of times.... It
weighed on everybody’s mind.”’

From lowa State to W&L

‘I can't imagine anything better happening to me.

By MIKE ALLEN
Staff Reporter

John W. Elrod, recently
chosen as Washington and Lee’s
next Dean of the College, says
he is ‘‘not going to come as a
dean with an agenda.”

Elrod, 44, who heads the
philosophy department at Iowa
State University in Ames, Iowa,
will succeed William J. Watt on
Aug. 1.

In a_ telephone interview,
Elrod said he plans to spend his
first year at W&L “really
familiarizing myself with the
University’s program and with
faculty needs and problems.”

“Only then will I begin work-

ing with faculty and students on
any changes that might come
up,” he said.

‘“‘The best administrators are
those who work with a situation
in concrete terms,” he con-
tinued. ‘‘Right now my
knowledge of the school is very
abstract.”

‘“‘The main responsibility of
an administrator is maintaining
and enhancing the quality of the
institution he serves,’’ Elrod
said.

‘‘The way I see my role as an
administrator is to help the
faculty do its job, and to main-
tain the teaching and research
quality of the institution.”

‘An effective administrator
creates an environment in
which it is possible to work
closely with the faculty and to
cooperate with them,” he add-
ed.

‘“‘As far as I know, Washing-
ton and Lee is in very good
financial shape,’’ Elrod said in
discussing key issues that face
the school.

‘Washington and Lee has to
decide what it wants to do about
coeducation. As soon as it gets
that out of the way, I don’t see
any major problems in the near
future.”’

Elrod, who has visited Lex-

y)

Our warm hand
of service
is aphone call away

ington twice in the last year,
called W&L ‘‘an institution of
enormous quality.”

“What attracted me most
about Washington and Lee was
working for an institution of
such distinction and with such
outstanding faculty and stu-
dents,”’ he said.

He added that he is “‘very im-
pressed”’ by President John D.
Wilson, and that he is looking
forward to working with him.

“IT wish I could express the
thrill and excitement I have
about coming to Washington
and Lee,” he said. ‘‘It is, profes-
sionally, the most exciting mo-
ment of my life. I can’t imagine
anything better happening to
me.’

Elrod said President Wilson
offered him the position in early
January, and that he formally
accepted it two weeks later.

“‘T had pretty much made up
my mind after we left after our
second trip there,” he said.
“But I wanted to think about it
in the context of it actually be-
ing a real offer.

‘“‘The same positive feelings
we had initially came back at
that time. I accepted with
tremendous happiness.”’

Elrod said that coming to
W&L brings him back to his
roots ‘‘in two very definite
senses’? — one geographical,
the other professional.

Raised in Griffin, Ga., Elrod
said he’s always considered
himself a Southerner. Since
then he’s lived in a number of
areas.

‘‘We’ ve had a strong desire to
return to the South,’’ he said.

The other reason that Elrod
said he considers his new post a
homecoming is that he’ll be
returning to a small college.

He received his undergradu-
ate training at Presbyterian
College in Clinton, S.C., which
currently has a student body of
950.

“‘T’ve never forgotten that ex-

¢ SERVICE

a eae eo

perience,” he said. ‘Having
seen what the other side of the
fence looks like, I’ll be glad to
return to my _ educational
roots.”” (Iowa State has just
under 25,000 students. )

He completed his master’s
and doctoral work at Columbia
University in New York, which
has an enrollment of 18,500.

“At a state university, you
have good students, but you
don’t have the uniform high
quality in the student body that
you do at a_ school like
Washington and Lee,’ he
stated.

“On a campus like Washing-
ton and Lee’s, you work in an
environment that is more
manageable. At a large institu-
tion, it is very difficult to set at-
tainable goals.’”’

Elrod said his main regret in
leaving Iowa State is that he’s
going to miss his former col-
leagues.

“Towa has been very in-
strumental in my development
as a philosopher and as an ad-
ministrator,’’ he added.

The dean-elect is an expert on
the 19th century Danish
religious philosopher Soren
Aabye Kierkegaard. Two of
Elrod’s books on that writer
have been published by Prince-
ton University Press.

Kierkegaard is regarded as
one of the founders of existen-
tialism, the philosophy profess-
ed by writers from Jean-Paul
Sartre to Norman Mailer.

In his writings, Kierkegaard
emphasized the concepts of the
individual, of choice, of dread
and of paradox, all of which are
said to be fundamental themes
of existentialism.

Elrod said he was ‘‘extremely
impressed” with Kierkegaard
the first time he read the
author, and found the writing
‘‘compelling.”’

“I saw he was concerned with
the same problems I was,”’
Elrod recalls. ‘‘He was some-

Dean-elect John W. Elrod

thing of a philosophical soul-
mate.”

In 1975, Elrod published ‘‘Be-
ing and Existence in Kierke-
gaard’s Pseudonymous
Works.” In a review, Choice
magazine said that it was ‘‘an
important but specialized book
on the thought of Kierkegaard,
the ‘father of existentialism.’ ”’

Elrod’s more recent book,
published in 1981, is titled
“Kierkegaard and Christen-
dom.”’

A Library Journal appraisal
said, ‘“‘Elrod’s fluent approach
and his inclusion of appropriate
background make this study
valuable to both new and knowl-
edgeable Kierkegaard stu-
dents.”

It said the work ‘‘belongs in
most philosophy and religion
collections.”

The dean-elect said he’s going
to shift his focus away from
Kierkegaard and bring himself
“up-to-date on contemporary

‘French and German _philoso-

phers.”’

“My scholarly life will now be
given over to reading in that
area,’’ he said.

Elrod called himself an
“avid’’ tennis player, and said
he jogs 20-30 miles a week.

He also said he’s a ‘‘budding
ornithologist” and a “‘lover of
music.”

‘Although I don’t play an in-
strument, I’m an avid concert
and theater-goer,’’ he said.

On his visits, he has admired
the ‘19th century colonial
America look which Lexington
rather self-consciously main-
tains.’”’

‘I like that very much,’’ he
said. ‘‘It pleases me no end.”’

Elrod and his wife, Mimi, who
has a Ph.D. in child develop-
ment, plan to move to Lex-
ington on July 15. They have
two children, Adam, 15, and
Joshua, 12.

Will Gary leave his Hart in San Francisco?

By MIKE ALLEN

A funny thing happened on
the way to the coronation.

Guess who’s not laughing?

Yes, Walter, there is a nomi-
nating process, and no, you
don’t get a non-stop ticket to
San Francisco.

Mondale’s campaign has
been on the fritz ever since
Gary Hart’s “upset’’ in New
Hampshire. Supporters of the
former vice president had
nightmares about ‘“‘Super Tues-
day,” with visions of HART-
MAN gobbling up all of Mon-
dale’s delegates.

That didn’t happen, though
—Tuesday was neither super
nor disastrous for either can-
didate. As far as what’s next,
the future is certain to be as un-
predictable as the past.

“It’s going to be a marathon
all the way to California,’’ Mon-
dale said Tuesday night.

“One of us will have this race
wrapped up by the middle part
of this process — in the next 30
days,” Hart said Wednesday.

 

Mike Allen is a political
analyst for the Mock Con-
vention.

No one is sure. That’s why the
Mock Convention ran into a lit-
tle trouble last week when it
presented its very highly
educated guesses in starkly
tabular form.

The Mock Convention predic-
tors (including, admittedly, this
reporter) didn’t issue a state-
ment which said, “Dewey Beats
Truman,”’ but at first glance, it
seemed to be almost that bad.

The truth is that, taken as a
whole, the predictions were no
wider of the mark than anyone
else’s, and were based on much
better information. Hart didn’t
take Alabama, and he was
stronger than expected in a few
of the caucuses, but there were
sound reasons for each of the er-
rors (a moral victory? ).

A columnist in the Roanoke
paper, commenting on the
predictions, wrote Wednesday
morning that ‘‘if the students
were right, nobody on the day
after Super Tuesday has a sure
grip on the nomination.” By
that standard, the trend iden-
tified by the Mock Convention
researchers was right on
target.

Perhaps the most reliable
method of accurately prediet-

ing the outcome of these races
is one offered facetiously by
William Buchanan, head of the
W&L politics department.

“Hart tends to win in places
where it snows, and Mondale is
strong in places that it rains,”’
he said Wednesday. ‘‘Maybe we
should have the candidates
come out of their holes every
Tuesday, see if they see their
shadow, and then we’d know
what was going to happen.”’

The next battleground for the
four underdogs is ‘“‘Super Satur-
day,” a day on which 356
delegates are at stake, in-
cluding 155 from the important
state of Michigan.

The following Tuesday is the
Illinois primary (194 dele-
gates), and it’s possible that
that contest will be the decisive
lap in the Hart-Mondale vote-a-
thon.

Network exit polling Tuesday
indicated that if Glenn were to
withdraw (and that is possible
— likely, even — as soon as to-
day), Hart would pick up con-
siderable strength from Glenn’s
former supporters. That could
turn the tide in Illinois, where
Mondale is the current favorite.

In the days between “Super
Tuesday” and Saturday, Mon-
dale was scheduled to cam-
paign exclusively in Illinois and
Michigan. Hart will add Arkan-
sas to those two, and Jesse
Jackson will make appearances
in South Carolina, as well as the
other three states.

It’ll be interesting to watch
Hart in Michigan explaining his
vote against the Chrysler bail-
out and Mondale in Illinois
passifying the farmers who
were severely hurt by the

Carter Administration’s grain

embargo of the U.S.S.R.

(If Mondale was as close to
the center of the action as
George Bush is, he probably
didn’t know about it until he
read about it in the morning
paper, anyway.)

On the Sunday before ‘Super
Tuesday,” there were some in-
teresting moments in the Atlan-
ta debate besides Walter ‘Hot
’n Juicy” Mondale’s ‘‘Where’s
the beef?’’ quip.

Mondale may have been guil-
ty of a fraud-ian slip when he
was defending himself in an ex-
change with Hart. ‘I’m going to
stand up for special — uh,
against special interests,’ he.
proclaimed.

During the debate, we found
out that Hart pronounces
“‘divisive’’ even worse than
Jimmy Carter pronounced
“‘nuclear.’’

Also, in an exchange with
Mondale concerning Hart’s vote
on a windfall profit tax for oil
companies, Hart cried, ‘‘There
you go again.” Apparently not
content to steal lines from John
Kennedy, he also borrows them
from Reagan.

One of McGovern’s last com-
ments of the campaign was:
“I’m sure that some of the
viewers think that the five of us
Democrats sitting here are
making partisan judgments
about the president.’ What were
that guy’s SAT scores, anyway?

The networks’ post-primary
programs on Tuesday also of-
fered some memorable ex-
changes.

Roger Mudd of NBC, in a live
interview with Hart, opined that
“Florida is not a true Southern
state.’’ It seceded — what more

do you want?
The best line of the evening
was from ABC’s David

Brinkley, who said to Hart, ‘‘If
you were running for president
of New England, you’d be in
good shape.”

In spite of his otherwise clear-
ly superior performance, the
silliest. phraseology of the night
was from Dan Rather of CBS.
He started a question for the
senator from Colorado by say-
ing, ‘In your heart of hearts...’

In their speeches to their sup-
porters Friday night, none of
the candidates claimed that
their victory was a personal one
(and yes, they all claimed vic-
tory).

“‘Rather,”’ they said, “‘it is a
victory for. . .’’ fill in the blank.
Mondale: ‘all of us.’ Hart:
“the people of this country.”

Glenn: ‘“‘this idea .. . this
dream.”’ Politicians are so
modest.

Here’s the latest line from the
Mock Convention on ‘Super
Saturday”’:

ARKANSAS (C) — Mondale
barely edging Hart; a good
state for Glenn if he’s still in.

KENTUCKY (C) — Mondale
with Hart a strong second.

MICHIGAN (C) — Mondale
moderately over Hart.

MISSISSIPPI (C) — Mondale

victor; Jackson second.

SOUTH CAROLINA —Hart
followed by Jackson and Mon-
dale.

ILLINOIS (P) (March 20) —
Mondale a whisker ahead of
Hart, who continues to gain
ground.

MINNESOTA (C) (March 20)
— Mondale a big winner in his ©
home state.

Refining the decision-making process

WGL’s Society and the Professions Program: Teaching students to think

By ANDY HOPPES
Staff Reporter

Should a lawyer who knows
his client has committed a
murder for which another man
was convicted break the con-
fidential bond between lawyer
and client to save the innocent
man, or should he remain
silent?

Such barbed questions are
discussed and analyzed as part
of Washington and Lee’s
“Society and the Professions:
Studies in Applied Ethics’’ pro-
gram, according to Dr. Louis
W. Hodges, director of the pro-
gram.

Ethics programs in jour-
nalism, law and medicine were
begun at W&L in 1974, Hodges
said, and a program in business
was added last year.

The programs consist of three
main parts: a_ three-credit
course in the profession’s ethics
taught by Hodges and by a pro-
fessor from the appropriate
department, lectures featuring
prominent professionals, and a
three-day seminar that brings
together 15 ‘professionals and
the ethics students.

This year’s journalism ethics
institute will be held Friday,
Saturday and Sunday. In con-
nection with the institute there
will be a lecture by Gene
Foreman, managing editor of
the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fri-
day at 8 p.m. in Northen
Auditorium.

‘In applied ethics you focus
on the difference between
ethical concepts and profes-
sional decisions. We apply
ethical norms to professional
situations,” Hodges explained. .

Hodges cited the question of
confidential relationships be-
tween professionals and the
public as an issue that crops up
in every profession. Questions
dealing with a client’s right to
privacy and the problem of
dealing with incompetent pro-

<p oy go ota ye 4

Louis Hodges advises senior ethics student Eric Ca

fessionals also are common to
several occupations, he said.

“‘!’m convinced that there’s a
moral element in every decision
a human being makes,”’ argued
Hodges.

Moral questions deal with
what we owe to other people,
Hodges said. He explained that
the word ‘‘ought” is an archaic
form of the verb ‘‘to owe.”’
Thus, when someone says one
ought to do something, he is
really saying that you owe it to
others, Hodges said.

Nevertheless, the purpose of
the ethics program is not to con-
vince students that a certain
position is ethical or unethical,
Hodges pointed out. The pur-
pose of the program is to refine
the decision-making process
that the students use to decide
what is ethical, said Hodges.

“Students at the end of the
course are better able to
employ reason. They are better
able to understand the great
degree of complexity,’’ Hodges
asserted.

Americans are not very skill-
ed at using reason to cope with
moral issues, so people rely on
whims and vague opinions, he
said. By learning to use reason,
the student reduces the confu-
sion surrounding a moral issue,
Hodges explained.

‘I doubt that students change
their value system much. Some-
one who enters the course op-
posed to abortion leaves class
opposed to abortion but with
better reasons for it,’ said
Hodges.

Hodges emphasized that the
ethics program at W&L is a
liberal arts approach to the
issue. Thus, Hodges said, the
program is both beneficial in a
practical and an educational
manner. The pre-professional
becomes aware of his respon-
sibilities to other people and
also improves his way of think-
ing, said Hodges.

“At W&L you have the

development of the mind as an
end to itself, and also the
development of the mind for
professional purposes.”

Hodges said that W&L was
the first college to offer a pro-
gram in applied ethics at the
undergraduate level. Even to-
day not many universities have
undergraduate programs in ap-
plied ethics, he noted.

Nonetheless, Hodges believes
that there are advantages to of-
fering an applied ethics pro-
gram at the undergraduate
level rather than in graduate
school.

‘The student is more distanc-
ed from the occupation. At the
undergraduate level we do get
people at a time when they are
less professionally oriented,”
said Hodges.

The ethics classes have been
popular with the students at
W&L. Hodges said the business,
medical, legal and journalism
ethics classes are usually filled
close to their 15-student capaci-

e%

ty. Bright students in particular
have been attracted to the
classes, he said.

Hodges emphasized that the
ethics classes have always been
enjoyable to teach.

“We have a terrific set of
issues and problems. There’s a
lot of excitement in the class-
room that you don’t often get.
You get the pleasure of seeing
lights going on in people’s
heads,”’ he said.

Although he enjoys teaching
ethics, Hodges said that the con-
stant changes in the field re-
quire him to do a lot of reading
in order to keep up with the sub-
ject. Hodges also keeps in touch
with ethical issues through con-
tact with professionals off cam-
pus. Hodges said he visits news-
rooms, holds seminars at some
newspapers and television sta-
tions and works with the
Hastings Center, an _ ethics
‘think tank’ in New York City.

Hodges said that he has noted
a tremendous surge in interest
in ethics in recent years. He
recently has helped West Vir-
ginia develop ethics programs
for its colleges. Almost 90 per-
cent of medical schools now of-
fer courses in medical ethics,
while ethics courses were of-
fered in about half of the
medical schools in the country
ten years ago, Hodges reported.

“As a civilization we are
more aware now of the power
that professionals have. Con-
sumers are more knowledge-
able and are putting more
pressure on professionals,’’ he
said.

Professionals are responding
to this pressure by taking
greater interest in the ethical
questions related to their field,
he explained. The fear of mal-
practice and libel suits has
spurred professionals to take a
closer look at their practices,
said Hodges.

The increasing maturity of

  
   

professional groups also has
contributed to the increase in
concern for ethics, Hodges
asserted.

‘“‘The professions are coming
of age. The mature group is
always concerned more with
matters of ethics than the im-
mature group,” he said.

Rapid technological advances
also have presented profes-
sionals with new moral ques-
tions. The ability to successfully
perform a kidney transplant,
for instance, raises the question
of who should get the available
kidneys, Hodges noted.

‘‘The more things we can do,
the more you have to ask
yourself what ought we to do.
There are never any new
ethical problems, but old
ethical problems that take new
forms,”’ he said.

Because of the rapid social
and technological changes tak-
ing place in the country, ethics
will be an important topic for
the next 20-25 years. However,
if the pace of change slows
down in the coming years, in-
terest in ethics will diminish
also, said Hodges.

“I predict that interest will
once again wane. The history of
interest in ethics is sort of like a
roller coaster,’’ said Hodges.

Nevertheless, before interest
in ethics diminishes again,
Hodges said that progress will
be made in many ethical issues.

In addition to the journalism
ethics institute at W&L this
weekend, a business ethics in-
stitute will be held March 23-25

at W&L and a medical ethics in-
stitute will be held during

spring term. The legal ethics in-
stitute was held in the fall.

Transcripts of lectures given
in connection with the institutes
are mailed out to all alumni in
that particular professional
field. Many alumni also par-
ticipate in the institutes, said
Hodges.

White Animals unleashed

By EDWIN BELL
Staff Reporter

The White Animals are pro-
bably one of the most popular
groups to play the East Coast
college circuit. Several reasons
account for their mass follow-
ing.

First, a White Animals con-
cert is like no other — it is an ex-
perience. Unlike most bands
who play three professional sets
and say goodbye, the White
Animals are willing to play as
long as the people in the crowd
can still raise their beer
glasses. They enjoy performing
their music and encourage the
audience to feel the ‘‘dread sen-
sation.”

Second, the individual
members’ charisma and stage
presence create an unusual at-
mosphere of give-and-take with
audience.

Third, the White Animals are
all talented musicians who per-
form their own versions of
psychedelic 60s, punk, dub, reg-
gae and soul.

All factors combine to create
the ‘‘dreadbeat sensation” — a
feeling of fear mixed with awe
and reverence, the natural
result of vibrations and exter-
nal stimuli.

The White Animals originate
from Nashville, the hometown
of all of the band’s members ex-
cept Kevin Gray. Gray, a native
of Dallas, is rhythm guitarist
and lead vocalist. He is the one
who can best explain the name
of the group.

“The name describes us
—white kids playing the blues.”’

The rest of the quintet is
bassist and part-time vocalist
Steve Boyd; lead guitarist Rich
Parks; drummer Ray Crab-
tree; and soundman (‘‘dread-
master’’) Tim Coats.

The group has relased an EP
(extended play), ‘‘Nashville
Babylon,’’ an LP, ‘‘Lost

Weekend,” and a video for their

new single, ‘Don’t Care.” The
video has been placed on MTV’s
Light Rotation (2 plays a day.).
Their new album, “Ecstasy,”
was spotlighted as ‘“‘New and
Noteworthy” in Billboard
Magazine (Feb. 18).

The ‘‘dreadbeat sensation’’ is
reflected in ‘‘Ecstasy,” which
also shows off the musical
maturity the group has gained
in the past few years.

Coats’ soundboard creates
the dread, and Ray Crabtree’s
drums turn up the beat. Coats
and Gray also give the music a
better producation and a
clearer sound than previous ef-
~~.

 

The White Animals (left to right): Steve Boyd, base; Ray Crabtree, drums; Kevin Gray, guitar, lead

critics. It might just be the hit
they need.

Parks and Boyd combine
writing efforts on the next act,
“Goodnight and Goodbye.”
Boyd laments on the problem of
an old girlfriend who hangs on
for too long. Backed by Beatles’
harmonies and echo vocals
(trademarks of the White
Animals), Boyd’s timid voice
gives the tune a raspy edge.

Boyd again shows a great feel
for his music in ‘‘This Girl of
Mine.” The track is unique
because it is not cluttered with
overdubs. The song and its sim-
ple arrangement is surely a
tribute to the Beatles.

 

‘“Eestasy” is a total concept product —

it relates the sound, image and _ at-

mosphere of a live performance.’

 

“Ecstasy” is a total concept
product — it relates the sound,
image, and atmosphere of a live
performance.

“Gloria,” the only cover song
is a revealing glimpse of ‘the
total White Animals concept.
Gray transforms the simple
lyrics of Van Morrison into a
story full of clever innuendos.
Clocking in at a length of 9:14,
the song is a series of erotic
choruses and psychedelic in-
strumentals that build on one
another until the final climax of
the traditional ‘‘G-L-O-R-I-A.”’

An original single, “Don’t
Care,” is a marriage of the
“dance my life away” attitude
of Prince mixed with the punk-
anthem call of the Clash. The
song has already received con-
siderable regional airplay and
caught the attention of several

“For Lovers Only” is Gray’s
nod to the group’s rhythm and
blues roots. The slow, hypnotic
beat conjures up the smokey
blue haze of a slow dance at the
end of -a long night. Gray’s
hoarse vocals and Park’s
ringing solos evoke the
primitive emotions that arise
from these close situations. The
song leaves one with the ex-
hilarating fatigue that comes at
the end of a White Animals con-
cert.

“Ecstasy” is a step in the
right direction. The record ac-
curately captures the unique
White. Animals’ sound and re-
flects the maturity the group
has gained over the years. The
only better way to capture this
image, sound and atmosphere
would be for the White Animals
to release a live album, which I
hope is not too far in the future.

Senior directs
‘Hot Tin Roof’

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

“Tennesse Williams said that
every human being is a selfish
animal and the world is a cage.
I’m basing my production on
this quote,”’ said Drew Perkins,
director of “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof,’’ which opens March 23 at
the Troubador Theatre. The
play is the winter production of
the University Theatre and will
run through March 28. Curtain
time is 8 p.m. for all perfor-
mances.

Perkins, who is directing the
play for his senior thesis, said
he chose “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof’”’ because “I have a
natural flavor for Tennesse
Williams. I didn’t want to go
through four years of college
without doing any Williams. He
is as much a classic as
Shakespeare. Too many people
take Williams too seriously. I
think people should enjoy his
comedy and learn from his
serious drama.”

“The simple plot is about the
passing of an estate from one
generation to the next. What
makes it complicated is that
this family is divided between

two sons.’’ Brick, played by
W&L senior Bob Ferguson, is
the more empathetic of the two
sons in spite of his alcoholism.
His brother, Gooper, played by
first year law student Chuck
Richards, is a successful cor-
porate lawyer who “‘is a lot like
Macbeth because he is driven
by his ambitious wife.”’

Bill Rough, director of
theatre at Southern Seminary
Junior College, plays Big Dad-
dy, the patriarch of the family.
It is the news that Big Daddy is
dying of cancer that sends the
family into confusion over an
heir. “Big Daddy doesn’t know
he’s dying until the family tells
him,” Perkins said.

“My whole concept for the
play is a cage.” he said. ‘‘This
family can’t resolve this pro-
blem. They are trapped in this
cage.”

Also featured in the cast are
first year law student Nan
Korns as Maggie, Ginger
NeNeese as Big Mama,
Southern Seminary student Liz
Spence as Mae, senior Ted
Petrides as Dr. Baugh,
sophomore David Marsh as the
Rev. Tooker, and junior Terry
McWhorter as Lacey.

Film Society to show
Russian ‘Siberiade ’

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity Film Society will pre-
sent a 1979 Russian film titled
“Siberiade” at 8 p.m. Friday
and Saturday, March 16 and 17.

The film will be screened in
Classroom A of Lewis Hall. The
film will be shown in Russian
with English subtitles. There is
no charge for admission and the
public is invited to attend.

Directed by Andrei Kon-
chalovsky, ‘‘Siberiade”’ is a
lavishly photographed epic set
in a remote hamlet in Siberia.

Spanning three generations and
six decades, the film traces the
fortunes of two families — one
rich, the other poor — as their
village is touched by the enor-
mous changes of the 20th cen-
tury, in particular the Russian
Revolution.

In its original four-and-a-half
hour form (the W&L version
will be 183 minutes long),
“Siberiade” was an enormously
popular success in its native
country, with more than 70
million viewers.

Glee Club to perform
special Lenten Concert

The Washington and Lee
University Glee Club and the
Hollins College Chapel Choir
will present a special Lenten
Concert on Tuesday, March 20,
at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The public is invived to at-
tend. Admission is free.

The concert program will
feature a performance of
Mozart’s ‘“‘Solemn Vespers’ by
the combined choirs with
soprano soloist Rita Cummins.
Written in 1780, the text for
Mozart’s ‘‘Solemn Vespers”’ is
taken from the Psalms and the

Gospel of Luke.
In addition to ‘Solemn
Vespers,’’ the two musical

groups will perform sacred
motets.

Washington and Lee’s 57-
member Glee Club is directed
by Gordon Spice, associate pro-
fessor of music at W&L.

The Hollins College Chapel
Choir is conducted by James
Leland, who will be the organist
for the concert.

The Lenten Concert will also
be performed in the Hollins Col-
lege Chapel on Sunday, March
17, at7 p.m.

High praise and vegetables too
Aloha Wok offers wide range of good meals

By EDDIE CURRAN
Staff Reporter

A famed rock journalist once
said that the only honest way to
review a record is to review it
strictly according to time spent
on the turntable. Granted this
method cannot be applied to
every category subject to
review. One couldn’t get away
with, “I only read it once, so...,”’
or ‘‘I only had one date with her,
so...’’ but it is nonetheless fairly
applicable with respect to food,
as long as you make sure to
keep in mind certain variables,
such as ease of acquisition (ie.
“Let the Domino’s man get cold
and miss the second half.’’)

Dd
The
Eat Beat

Applying this criteria, I have
no choice but to give the Aloha
Wok high praise. My father,
who serves as a middleman be-
tween the bank and myself as
he sends me my used checks,
once asked almost heatedly,
‘“‘What’s this Aloha Wok?’”’ Well,
the Aloha Wok, or ‘‘the Wok,”’ is
the only Chinese restaurant in
Lexington, and we should be
thankful for it. There are pro-
bably few Lexington-size towns
out there with a Chinese
restaurant, much less one as
good as the Wok.

For freshmen and unadven-
turous upperclassmen, the
Aloha Wok is located at 409
South Main St., about 3 blocks
past where Main St. becomes
two-way, and attached to the
left side of the Royal Host Hotel.
It’s open for lunch and dinner
six days a week, closed on Mon-
days and closed for lunch on
Saturdays.

The Wok is_ not one-
dimensional. It can be a nice
place to take a date for
candlelight dinner with drinks
and low, mysterious Chinese
music, or a place to get a
reasonably priced lunch on a
weekday, to get take-out, and
eat at home, or, and this is my
favorite way to enjoy the Wok,
to eat all the Chinese food you
can eat at their Sunday buffet.

Forking out the $4.95 for the
Sunday buffet at the Aloha Wok
can be justified on several
levels — it’s delicious, you pro-
bably won’t need to eat again
until the next day and you are a
growing boy who needs his
vegetables. It is with respect to
vegetables that the Chinese
Style of cooking stands above all
others. It seems like only
yesterday that cooked cabbage
and carrots were dirty words,
something you had to hold your
nose and eat so you could have a
piece of cake. Maybe if mothers
owned woks they wouldn’t have
to bake so many cakes, because:
Chinese style vegetables are an
end unto themselves. Broccoli,
snow peas, celery, water

chestnuts and much more can
be mixed in a seemingly endless
number of combinations. And
the best part about Chinese
vegetables is their unforgetta-
ble crispness; freshness is nev-
er doubted for one bite. If your
fraternity house doesn’t serve
what you consider to be
vegetables worth eating, or if
you eat too many hamburgers
and pizzas, it’s likely that you
might eat more vegetables at
the Wok’s Sunday buffet than
you would eat for the entire rest
of the week. When you consider
that vegetables are good for
you, even necessary, this is
something to think about.

But, you ask, quoting the wit-
ty candidate Walter Mondale,
‘“‘Where’s the beef?”’ If you look
under the vegetables, I think
you'll find it. At the buffet,
you'll always have at least one
chicken, pork and beef dish (no
seafood dishes at the buffet), at
least one of which will be a
spicy dish. There is plenty of
meat, especially in the chicken
dishes. Every Sunday there is a
different combination of six
Chinese dishes — for instance,
you might have Chicken Al-
mond, Beef with Green Pepper,
Roast Pork with Snow Peas,
Beef Chow Mein, Chicken Fried

 

Rice, and the Vegetables
Sauteed.

‘you ask, ...
““Where’s’ the

beef?” If you look

under the  vege-
tables, I think
you'll find it.’

 

There will also be a sweet and
sour dish, a personal favorite,
with chicken, pork or wonton.
This has a sweet and sour
pineapple sauce poured over
(or if you like, not poured over)
fried chunks of chicken, pork,
or fried wonton.

There is also, and this is im-
portant, all the egg rolls you can
eat. The egg rolls are delicious,
with a flaky, crunchy, golden
outside covering whatever it is
that’s so good inside an egg roll.
An anomymous friend and
fellow chow-hound begs me to
stick a couple of these in my
coat pocket to bring him, and is

very disappointed if I forget.
Don’t forget to dip the egg rolls
in the available sweet sauce or
Chinese mustard though watch
out for the mustard. Too much
will clear the pipes like am-
monia never could.

Also, there is tossed salad and
a dessert, usually not that good,
but this matters little, for you
can eat lettuce anywhere, and
there are plenty of better ways
here to fill limited stomach
Space than with dessert
anyway. Get some more sweet
and sour chicken if you need to
satisfy a sweet tooth.

If you go to the Wok at night,
check the menu carefully, as it
has a description of each meal.
For instance, I’ve never had
Hai Shien Sizzhing, but
“Choicest gulf shrimp, delicate
crab meat, succulent scallop
sauteed with exotic mushrooms
and folded in vegetable sauce”’
sounds pretty good to me.

I can speak first hand of the
Four Seasons, a dish of chicken,
shrimp, beef, roast pork, and
Chinese vegetables. The
vegetables in the Four Seasons
are especially good; among
them are what appear to be
bite-size stalks of corn, called
baby corn ears. They alone
make the dish memorable.

The Wok has several exotic
drinks and appetizers to choose
from while you’re waiting for
your meal. I went on a school
night, so I couldn’t drink, but
drinks with names like Blue
Hawaii and Fog Cutter were
tempting. If you want an ap-
petizer, they have what’s called
a Flaming Puu Puu Tray, with
barbecue rib, shrimp tempura,
fried wonton, cho-cho (which is
strips of beef that you dip in a
sauce and stick over a flame).
This tray is more fun than it is
tasty, as the ribs and chicken
wings are not house specialties,
the shrimp tempura is heavily
breaded, and the cho-cho,
though exciting to heat and eat,
doesn’t have much taste. For
the non-pyromaniac though, I
recommend an order of fried
wontons, which are crunchy on
the outside, with a chewy piece
of meat on the inside, and are
good with sweet sauce and
mustard, and/or some egg
rolls. The wonton soup is also
very good. And of note, every-
thing you can get on the Wok
menu you can also get for Wok
take-out. Plenty of the dishes
are cheaper than a delivered
pizza, and will make you hap-
pier afterwards.

And the Wok offers luncheon
specials at around $3; the serv-
ings are slightly smaller, but
you get an egg roll with the
meal. Keep these in mind if
your fraternity serves hot dogs
for the second day in a row, or if
they’re serving those open-
faced Reubens in the dining
hall.

Next week, the Eat Beat
locates the well hidden Old
Main Sandwich Shop.

Lax falls into first-quarter hole

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

Despite outscoring Navy 8-5
in the game’s last three
quarters, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse Generals could not
dig themselves out of an 8-1 first
quarter hole, falling to the Mid-
shipmen 13-9, Saturday after-
noon at Wilson Field.

The loss evens the Generals’
season mark at 1-1, while Satur-
day’s win was Navy’s first
match of its 1984 campaign.

“It was a disappointment for
us to lose a game that I think we
proved we were capable of win-
ning,’ W&L head coach Dennis
Daly said.

Navy helmsman Bryan Mat-
thews was content with his
team’s consistency. “I was
pleased at what we showed we
were capable of doing when we
played real well, and I was
pleased that when things got go-
ing tough we didn’t fold up and
go home,” he said.

Navy’s explosive start put
W&L on the short end from the
outset. Midshipman Robert
Garland bounced a shot past
goalie Phil Aiken with 2:51 gone
in the first period to set off a
seven-goal barrage that put
Navy in front to stay.

“When a team gets things
clicking, it’s tough to stop,”
Matthews pointed out.

But the Generals’ mentor saw
the quarter differently.

“There were too many little
breakdowns early on, both on
the offensive end and the defen-
sive end,” Daly said, ‘‘that
caused Navy to get a spurt on
us.”

The Generals’ Barry Water-
man scored with 3:30 to go in
the quarter, ending the Navy at-
tack. The two teams played
evenly throughout the rest of
the match.

The Generals rallied to
outscore Navy 4-3 in the second
quarter, and the teams went to
the locker room at halftime
with the Middies out in front,
11-5. Junior attack Jeff Mason
triggered the W&L comeback,

scoring three goals in the last
five minutes of the half.

The second half proved a
defensive struggle with much of
the play at midfield. Daly said
he was pleased with his team’s
effort in this area. He cited the
fine play of middies Kevin
Walakovits, Barry Waterman
and T.J. Finnerty.

The Generals gave up the
first two goals of the third

Navy victory. Nims turned
away 14 General shots and was
successful on 26 of 37 attempts
toclear.

that we never think he’s about
to fold. It was not an unusual
performance for him at all,”’

JEFF MASON

 

“Their reputation is as a run-
ning team, but there are some
reports that they might be a lit-
tle less of a running team,’’ Da-
ly said. He emphasized the tran-
sition game and control of the
other team’s fast break as key
points of concentration for
W&L.

The Generals end their road
trip Wednesday with a match
against Delaware.

 

 

‘It was a disappointment for us to lose a

game that I think we proved we were

capable of winning.’

 

While both teams got scoring
opportunities, Daly said,
Navy’s more often resulted in
scores. ‘‘We were hitting
singles, and they were hitting
home runs,’’ he said.

With six minutes to play in the
quarter and the score 4-0, junior
John DiDuro came in to replace
Aiken, who had saved only one
of the five shots he faced.
DiDuro went on to finish the
game, turning away 13 shots
and allowing nine goals.

tomassimo each registered
goals to close out the scoring.

Taking the title
is no easy task

By MIKE STACHURA
Sports Editor

....Well, everybody is calmed
down now and ready to dig
themselves in for the over-
before-you-know-it NCAA
championship tournament.
With the conference shenani-
gans and the troublesome selec-
tion process all through, we
come to the determination of a
definitive national champion.
And let’s get that matter
cleared up right away. First,
you can’t arrive at a No. 1 team
in the country by any method.
Everyone will have his gripe
about a tournament, the main
one being that the tournament
winner is merely a team lucky
enough to survive the pressure-
packed grind. Too much, they
say, can depend on the luck of
the draw. Or, the winner of the
tournament is the hottest team
at the right time, not the group
with the best overall perfor-
mance for the year. Well, begg-
ing these complainers’ pardons,

son are as good as anyone ever
was and are getting better. But
it’s tournament time, so let’s
not engrave the trophy yet. In
the East Regional, Carolina is
fading and Eddie Sutton’s Hogs
are peaking. Other squads to
watch: Syracuse — they really
beat G-town in the Big East
final — and Auburn. In the

i ee eee ee)
Time Out...

Mideast, watch Maryland (very
hot) and Kentucky (very
good). Sleepers: UAB (Bar-
tow’s bunch is at home and was
born to upset people) and
Oregon St. The question in the
Midwest Regional is who has
enough guts to knock off
DePaul. Any team in this group-
ing does, but Memphis St. and
Wake Forest are my favorites
here. Finally, in the West,
UTEP or UNLV will get the
first shot at the Hoyas. Both
groups are capable. The winner
of Saturday’s second-round

IM Corner

 

 

‘Well, begging these complainers’ par-

dons, but they’re wrong.’

 

but they’re wrong. First, no one
wins on luck alone, especially
not for four, five or six games in
a row. Second, teams that don’t
belong there don’t go. This is
not to say that teams that don’t
go, don’t belong there. UT-
Chattanooga (23-6) and Lamar
(25-4) are two fine squads that
weren’t invited, but never-
theless there are very few easy
rides tec Seattle this year as in
any yer. Anybody can beat
anybody on any given day and
it’s no truer than at tournament
time. Just ask Dean Smith
about the upset. There is
nothing comparable to the com-
petitive pressure an NCAA
favorite faces at tournament
time. In addition, the pressure
is equally great for those teams
labeled Cinderellas after this
weekend. The point being that
to win the national tournament
takes a good enough team to be
invited in the first place (no
small order), an ability to main-
tain the mental and physical
capabilities of a winner, and
enough luck to guide you to the
title. And for my money any
team that can muster those
characteristics deserves to be
known as national champion...
...Given that summation,
here are the teams that should
make headlines during the
month. Right at the top, the
Hoyas are the team to beat.
Georgetown and John Thomp-

clash between. the two will win
the region, unless Tisdale at
Oklahoma gets juiced. There-
fore, my _ conservative
estimates for visitors in Seat-
tle: Syracuse, Kentucky, Mem-
phis St. and UNLV....

...90me quick colonnade
thoughts. Saturday’s lax game.
The first quarter was a dis-
grace. That can only be said
because of how well the last

Netters fall to Div. I Lehigh,
trounce Emory & Henry, 8-1

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team opened its 1984 ODAC
schedule with an 8-1 victory
against Emory and Henry yes-
terday at the W&L tennis
courts. The Generals, who up-
ped their season mark to 2-2,
however dropped a match to
NCAA Division I Lehigh by a
score of 6-3 at home on Monday.

W&L won five of the six
singles matches and swept the
three doubles matches in
yesterday’s impressive victory
over the Wasps. The match was
the Generals’ conference
opener.

Head tennis coach Gary
Franke was very pleased with
the Generals’ overwhelming
performance yesterday. Ac-
cording to Franke, Emory &
Henry had just finished their
southern tour before playing
W&L and their team was play-
ing well.

Concerning the Lehigh
match, Coach Franke said, ‘“‘I

 

thought it was a really even
match, a match we could have
very much won.”’ Franke be-
lieves that the key to the match
for Lehigh was their winning
two very close singles matches
at the No. 2and No. 4 positions.

Senior captain Craig Cannon
(No. 1) and sophomore Scott
Adams (No. 3) earned singles
victories for the Generals in the
losing cause. Cannon defeated
his opponent in straight sets,
6-3, 6-4. Adams fought back to
win his match, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, after
losing the first set.

Adams also teamed with sen
ior Jim Irwin at No. 3 doubles to
collect the Generals’ third and
final win of the match.

Friday, the Generals travel to
Williamsburg to play William
and Mary. The Generals return
home to play George Washing-
ton on Sunday at 10 a.m.

Other upcoming matches in-
clude an away contest against
Randolph-Macon on Monday
and a home match versus
Averett on Tuesday.

General cager Graves receives
All-District First Team honors

Senior captain John Lee
Graves has been selected to the
National Association of Basket-
ball Coaches All-South Atlantic
(All-District) First Team.

Graves, a pre-med major
with a 3.7 grade point average,
became W&L’s seventh all-time
scorer this year with 1,441
points and was named to the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
First Team.

 

 

 

 

“I’m very pleased for John
Lee. This award is an indication
that he has developed into an
outstanding basketball player,”
said W&L coach Verne Can-
field. ‘‘I am extremely proud of
his achievements.”’

Graves led the ODAC and the

state in field goal percentage
(55 percent) and free throw
percentage (87) and was fifth in
scoring (20.2 average). His free
throw percentage placed him
among the most accurate
shooters in the nation.

During his four-year career
at W&L, the Generals finished
with a 68-39 record. This season
W&L went 14-12.

‘Nine’ sweeps W. Va. Tech,

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
baseball team won two of four
home games last week to even
its record at 3-3.

Last Thursday, the Generals
fell to VMI 8-4 while playing in
bad weather. Freshman out-
fielder Adam Yanez provided
all of W&L’s offense, hitting a
grand slam home run in his first
collegiate at bat.

Sunday, W&L swept a double-
header from West Virginia
Tech by scores of 8-7 and 7-2.

In the first game the Generals
jumped out to a 5-0 lead in the
first inning. Singles by catcher
Mike Jacoby and _ shortstop-
captain Dave Warrenfeltz and a
double by rightfielder Chip Hut-
chins sparked the Generals ex-
plosive start.

West Virginia Tech battled
back from its deficit to take a
7-5 lead into the bottom of the
seventh inning. Led by Jacoby’s
game-winning single and five
walks issued by Golden Bears
pitchers, W&L tallied three

runs in the seventh to win the
game 8-7,

In the second game, W&L
jumped to an early lead and
was never threatened, winning
7-2. W&L pitcher Kirk Breen
turned in an excellent perfor-
mance and was supported by
third baseman Billy White’s
three hits. Second baseman
Kevin Golden also had three
hits, Warrenfeltz had two and
first baseman-captain Mike
Walsh hit a home run.

W&L head coach Jim Mur-
dock said that his team ‘‘did
what it took to win’’ against
West Virginia Tech.

' “In the first game, we did not
quit — a trademark of this’
team,” said Murdock. ‘‘In the
seventh, we simply became
more selective and put pressure
on them to put the ball over.
Jacoby then came up with the
clutch winning RBI single.”’

“In the second game, we
finally got our bats going. We
were not too anxious and seem-
ed to be relaxed at the plate,”’

ups mark to 3-3

 

Murdock said. ‘Breen also
pitched one heck of a game.”’

W&L lost to visiting Virginia
Wesleyan 8-3 Monday. The Gen-
erals fell behind 6-0 in the first
three innings and were unable
to score until the sixth inning,

‘Surprise ’

For six W&L_student-
swimmers, the promise of All-
America status and a finish
among the top teams in the na-
tion is within reach. On March
15-17 they will represent W&L in
the NCAA Division III National
Championships at Emory Uni-
versity in Atlanta.

The Generals have been
labeled a possible ‘surprise’
team by NCAA meet director
Scott Murphy. ‘Washington
and Lee University...offers
variety to the swimming
dominance of Midwestern and
California schools,’ he said.
“T’'d say that if anyone could
surprise it might be Washington
and Lee.”

The six Generals who will be
competing are seniors Tim
Rock and Gary Meyer, juniors
Bobby Pearson and Taber
Smith, sophomore Tim Stanford
and freshman Jay ReVille.

Rock, a biology major, will
compete in the 1,650-freestyle,
an event that he became an All-
American in three years ago.
He did not qualify for the
NCAAs last year, but set his

when two runs crossed the
plate.

Freshman Bill Schoettelkotte
started the game for the
Generals and was relieved by
another freshman, Randy
Brown, after the sixth inning.
Schoettelkotte gave up two

sights on making it again as a
senior.

‘In swimming, it is generally
easier for an underclassman to
excel at W&L because there are
less academic demands on
him,” explained W&L aquatics
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘Tim
proved he was an All-American
as a freshman, and his qualify-
ing again as a senior is an in-
dication of his character. He set
a personal goal to make swim-
ming part of his curriculum and
has passed with flying colors.”

Meyer, an economics major,
was the Generals’ lone All-
American last year, when he
finished the 100-yard free in 11th
place in the NCAAs. He will
compete in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle and the 400-yard free
relay this year. He has already
posted top-ten times in the na-
tion in both individual races this
year.

‘Gary has the ability and the
confidence to become an All-
American for the third year (he
was a member of W&L’s All-
America 400-free relay team in
1982),”’ said Remillard. ‘His
confidence is based on the fact

that he his made the right
sacrifices to get to this point. He
is in a solid position to break
three of Mike Bernot’s (Class of
1982) records.”

Pearson, an economics ma-
jor, and Smith, a business ma-
jor, will compete as members of
the 400-free relay teaiz ‘‘They
both have worked hard ali their
careers and have earned the
right to swim in the nationals,”
said Remillard.

Stanford, a business major,
will swim in the 100- and 200-
yard butterfly races and will
also be a member of the free
relay team. “Tim is mentally
and physically prepared and if
he can control his race pace he
could be in the top 12,” said
Remillard.

ReVille, a chemistry major,
has been phenomenal as a
freshman and will represent
W&L in the 200-and 400-yard in-
dividual medleys and the 200-
backstroke. ‘‘He is as talented
as any swimmer in Division
III,” stated Remillard. ‘He
should be in the top 12 in his
events and could finish as high
as the top six. His ability to
motivate himself and experi-
ence will be the keys, but I don’t
see either as a problem.”’

Last year W&L finished 40th
in the NCAAs, and a top-15
finish this year will be the
largest one-year jump ever for
a W&L team. If any of W&L’s
swimmers earn All-America
status, it will be the ninth con-
secutive year that the Generals
have had a swimmer earn that
distinction.

Thanksgiving threatened

(continued from page 1)

Feldman said ‘‘faculty
politics’’ would prevent ap-
proval of a two- or three-day
Thanksgiving vacation because
of the confusion that would
create with science laboratory
classes that meet only once a
week.

“So it’s either a week (for
Thanksgiving) or nothing,”
Feldman said.

A law student at Monday’s EC
meeting, though, recommended
a calendar followed by his
undergraduate school, Hamil-
ton College. There were no
classes on a Monday and a
Tuesday in the middle of Oc-
tober, normally around Colum-
bus Day. Thanksgiving vaca-
tion consisted of no classes on
Wednesday, Thursday or Fri-
day of Thanksgiving week.

not post the letter in the law
school, where Baumgaertner
won 242 of the 257 votes cast.

Green said he was setting up
the polls about 9 a.m. Thursday
when he noticed the posters and
took them down because he felt
they would exceed White’s limit
of 15 posters and because, he
said, they were ‘‘misleading.”’
The posters were misleading,
Green said, because although
they were signed by White, they
had not been put up by him.

Most EC members, though,
agreed that Green should have
conferred with White before
removing the posters. Presi-
dent Bob Jenevein said it was
Green’s position to determine
regulations, not etiquette.

“It was Green’s obligation to
approach White, not to take
down posters for him,’’ said
sophomore representative Ken
Lindeman. ‘‘It was not his place
as VRB chairman to take them

5 ARK NE EE IO FE PRE AES, PC EK.

Feldman said he personally
was in favor of that idea and
would recommend it to the
faculty tomorrow.

Feldman said he couldn’t see
any problems with the proposal
because each day’s classes
would be missed once. Thus,
although one section of a lab
might be ahead of the other be-
tween the October break and
Thanksgiving, it would all
balance out at the end of the
semester.

The committee voted to
recommend that students be re-
quired to register for their en-
tire year’s course-load the prior
spring because ‘‘the faculty is
very upset that they have to
spend 12 days in their offices
each year to register students,”’
Feldman said.

down.”

Junior representative Darby
Brower said, ‘“‘It is an illegal act
for anyone to take down some-
one else’s posters.”

Freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers said the VRB
chairman ‘‘does not have the
right to take down any poster.”

Vice president Dave Judge
said, ‘‘I think he kind of broke
that barrier of impartiality the
moment he took them down.”

Although junior represen-
tative and president-elect Cole
Dawson said he agreed it was
not right for Green to have
taken down the posters, he add-
ed, “I think it was an honest
mistake.”

After Green said he felt it was
his obligation as VRB co-
chairman to take them down,
Sicilian called for a new elec-
tion to be held.

“Tf this isn’t the case for a re-
vote, I don’t know when you’re
going to get one,”’ he said.

‘They felt the students were
careless under the drop-add
policy, and this would just make
them more respectful of the
system,’’ he added.

 

‘So it’s either a

week (for Thanks-

giving) or nothing.’

 

Junior representative Darby
Brower pointed out, though,
that the number of drop-adds
would increase because stu-
dents would have difficulty

selecting all their courses a
year ahead of time. Also, a stu-
dent who signed up for an
upper-level course in the winter
or spring but failed a pre-
requisite in the fall would have
to change his schedule in order
to take the pre-requiste again.

Senior representative Jim
Messer noted that, because
students would be registering
for so many courses at once,
there would be longer lines at
the professors’ offices during
the registration period.

Before the EC voted unani-
mously against the idea,
freshman representative An-
drew Caruthers said, ‘I don’t
have any sympathy (with the
professors) because we’re pay-
ing to be here and neck re paid
to be here.”’

The EC also voted unani-
mously against a one-week Oc-
tober vacation and 10-0-1, with
senior law representative Jim
Green abstaining, in favor of
the 12-12-6 calendar.

Feldman said he was ‘‘very
disappointed” with the par-
ticipation in the first calendar —
poll and hoped more students
would vote in Monday’s poll.
The polls will be open from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m., and seniors will
be allowed to vote on the calen-
dar issues.

The calendar committee
should finish its work and make
a report to President John D.
Wilson by mid-April, Feldman
said. Any calendar changes
would have to be approved by
the faculty and would not go in-
to effect until the 1985-86
academic year, he said.

 

Sicilian said after the meeting
that he made that statement
merely to show the EC that he
was serious; he _ reversed
himself later in the meeting,
saying he personally didn’t
think a new election was
necessary.

The EC voted 8-0, with White,
Messer and Green abstaining,
to approve Dawson’s motion to
stand behind the election unless
Baumgaertner, who was not at
Monday’s meeting, appealed
within 24 hours.

The EC also voted 10-0, with
White abstaining, to approve
Caruthers’ motion that any
campaign literature was an in-
dividual action and did not
represent the views of the EC.

Caruthers was appointed to
head a committee to study
possible revisions in the voting

Tules, particularly those con-

cerning the contributions a
third party may make in an
election.

White beat Baumgaertner by
26 votes. White captured 51.4
percent, or 482, of the 938 votes
cast, and Baumgaertner 48.6
percent, or 456.

In the secretary’s race,
Dalton won 64.4 percent, 591
votes, to defeat second-year law
student John Miller, who finish-
ed with 35.6 percent, or 327
votes.

In other action Monday night,
the EC heard budget reports
from:

The Mock Convention, which
has raised 81.17 percent of its
budget.

eThe Student Association for
Black Unity, which requested a
$1,500 to $2,000 contribution for
the May 5 SABU Ball, the pro-
ceeds from which will go
toward establishing a scholar-
ship in the name of former
secretary Marjorie Poindexter.
The EC delayed action until
next week.

The Ariel, which reported
that it still planned two issues
with a circulation of between

800 and 1,000. Rick Swagler,
editor, said the format would be
changed to more of a magazine
style with features as well as
the usual prose and poetry.
Under sharp questioning from
Jenevein and Messer, who
revealed that 280 copies were
unused last year, Swagler said
he felt the revised format would
increase student interest. “I
think we can get enough out to
justify the expense,”’ he said.

eThe Student Bar Associa-
tion, which reported that ex-
penses for a second-year law
students’ party had run $400
over budget due to some
damage done to the dining hall.

eThe Hockey Club, which had
its funds unfrozen by reporting
a $10 balance.

Petitions were received from
71 candidates for class offices.
Undergraduate elections will be
held Monday, with the polls
open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and
any runoffs will be Thursday.

April 2.
