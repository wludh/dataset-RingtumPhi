EC rules

on drugs
Says dealing

is dishonorable

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Drug dealing may be con-
sidered dishonorable and thus
an honor violation, the Ex-
ecutive Committee decided
Monday night after a_ brief
debate.

The EC also decided no longer
to require law students to sign
honor cards in order to vote in
EC elections and expressed an
interest in the possibility of
again having house mothers for
fraternities.

The EC’s action regarding
drug dealing reversed its state-
ment last year that declared
that drug dealing did not fall
under the honor system.

“T think drug use shouldn’t
fall under us,’’ freshman rep
Andrew Caruthers said. ‘‘But
drug trafficking, where some-
one is out to make a buck, is
dishonorable and
disreputable.” .

Caruthers motion was ap-
proved unanimously by the EC.

Sophomore rep James White
established a distinction bet-
ween dealing in drugs and
merely using drugs. ‘“‘People
who get caught up in it, rather
than pushers, need to be
helped,’’ he said.

The only other point of debate
centered around at which point
in the judicial process the EC
should begin to consider drug
dealing an honor violation.

EC President Bob Jenevein
said, ‘‘I hesitate to agree to wait
until the law has caught up with
somebody before we do.”’ The
EC decided to treat drug deal-
ing as any other honor violation
that would be reported by fellow
students or faculty members.

Parents hear Wilson

Wastes no time on issue of coeducation

By G. BRUCE POTTER
News Editor

Acknowledging that he was
the catalyst of the coeducation
issue, Washington and Lee
University President John D.
Wilson outlined the debate over
whether the school should ac-
cept women at the undergradu-
ate level during his report to the
parents Saturday morning.

Wilson’s Lee Chapel address
was the highlight of last week-

end’s 29th annual Parents’
Weekend.
“Bob Huntley (president

before Wilson) warned me that
the issue of coeducation would
arise,”’ Wilson said. ‘‘But I was
a little taken aback that it arose
so quickly.

“‘T probably was the catalyst.

me and I asked questions back

SAC votes to

reinstate Fiji

Selfimprovement plan initiated

By JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

After losing its University

~ recognition: three weeks ago

because of accumulated in-
cidents of misconduct, the
Washington and Lee chapter of
Phi Gamma Delta regained its
recognition Monday when the
Student Affairs Committee
voted unanimously to reinstate
the fraternity based on a pro-
mise of an extensive Fiji-
designed self-improvement
plan.

The Monday meeting was the
result of an appeal request by
Phi Gamma Delta after SAC
voted to rescind University
recognition of the fraternity in
the wake of an incident involv-
ing the Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege mascot.

At the Monday meeting, Fiji
presented a proposal which was
designed largely by represen-
tatives of the International of-
fice of Phi Gamma Delta, ac-
cording to Dean of Students and
SAC Chairman Lewis G. John.

The proposal specifies that all
of the current members of the
fraternity are suspended and
each must be interviewed by
members of the International
office before they are readmit-
ted to the fraternity, Dean John
said.

Phi Gamma Delta Interna-
tional will name a Board of Con-
trol which will be made up of
W&L Fiji alumni and Interna-
tional representatives who will
establish a set of minimum
standards which the fraternity
must meet, Dean John said.

“They (the Board of Control)
are really taking over,’’ said
Dean John. ‘‘They are not just
supervising.”’

Dean John said that the cur-
rent members of the fraternity
will be interviewed immediate-
ly following the Thanksgiving
holiday and an alumni advisor
to the fraternity will move into
the house as soon as possible.

“The plan is to have a newly
reorganized chapter by the end
of the term,’’ he said, ‘‘so that
those who are reaccepted will
have to agree to a very specific
standard of conduct.”

“‘T think the SAC did the right
thing,’’ said Dick Sessoms,
director of alumni programs
and Phi Gamma Delta faculty
advisor, after the SAC decision.

“T think that the University
and all those involved acted
responsibly,” he said. ‘‘I would
have been disappointed if they
had not given the fraternity a
chance.”

Although Sessoms responded
optimistically to the SAC deci-
sion, he noted that the future of
the fraternity is still uncertain.
He said that in the upcoming in-
terviews, the suspended mem-
bers of the fraternity will face
‘ta tough board of control.”

“‘T think it is clear that not all
will make it,’”’ he said. ‘‘They
are going to have to commit to
responsibility.”

‘In the future we will impress
upon the members one rule,”’ he

continued, ‘“‘the rule of the
gentleman. That’s the one
thing.”’

“This shows that Fiji is not as
bad as everyone says it is,”’ said
Mark McDonough, a Fiji sopho-
more. ‘‘In this matter we show-
ed that we are willing to
cooperate with the administra-
tion.”’

“We are still on campus. Phi
Gamma Delta is still around,”
McDonough said. ‘‘The alter-
native was nothing.”

Opinion

 

Wilson’s speech
raises questions

by JOHN CLEGHORN
Chief Editor

Coeducation. Coeducation.
Coeducation. Coeducation.
Many of us are on the verge of
becoming sick of the issue. It
pervades our classrooms, our
dinner table discussions and
even our parties. While we
sometimes want to shy away
from the matter, it is crucial
that we do not. Because of its
monumental effect on our uni-
versity, it is necessary that we
remain constantly in touch with
any stimuli in connection with
the subject.

Another opportunity to widen
our knowledge on the matter
arose this past weekend when
President John D. Wilson gave
the traditional report to the
parents in Lee Chapel Saturday
morning. In this most impor-
tant appearance before the
parents, it would have been
easy for President Wilson to
skirt the issue which no doubt
must be taking the same toll on
him as each of us. But in his
respectable never-waning
thought process, President
Wilson dove headfirst into the
issue. And in his aggressive ad-
dress of coeducation President
Wilson, in a very subtle but un-
mistakeable manner, displayed
some very pro-coeducation sen-
timents.

Comment

 

One of the most interesting
points in the speech came in his
discussion of the role of General
Robert E. Lee in the develop-
ment of Washington and Lee. In
only a few weeks after coming
to Washington College, Presi-
dent Wilson told the parents,
Lee made some of the most
revolutionary changes in the
history of the college including
the replacement of the code of
the gentleman for the previous-
ly used conduct catalogue, the
institution of the strict liberal
arts curriculum and the beginn-
ing of the construction of Lee
Chapel. Upon hearing President
Wilson tell of Generals Lee’s
liberal but vastly effective
measures, one could not help
thinking that he might have

been strategically driving at a
point of similarity.

In the second portion of his
speech, President Wilson took
time to spell out for the parents
the pro and con arguments of
coeducation. In weighing the
pro argument, President Wilson
took great care to cite the
details of demographics and the
possibility that W&L might be
falling behind the social mores
of the outside world. In this seg-
ment of his explanation, Presi-
dent Wilson posed the question,
“Are we (W&L) only _tech-
nically single sex?’’ And in sup-
port of this rhetorical point he
cited the women at the law
school, the exchange students
and several foreign exchange
students who attended W&L last
year. The fact that these women
had already attended W&L,
President Wilson seemed to
suggest, proved that indeed
W&L is only technically single
sex.

A large part of his pro-
coeducation explanation con-
sisted of a letter he had receiv-
ed that morning from a faculty
member on the subject. In that
letter, from which President
Wilson read several para-
graphs, the faculty member ad-
vocated coeducation, stating
that if W&L does not go coed, it
would soon be ‘“‘isolated...into
ethnocentricity.”

In all fairness, President
Wilson did give time to the
argument against coeducation.
But the reasons he cited were
clearly not explained in an
equally articulate and exten-
sive manner and the time given
to them did not approach that
given to the pro-coeducation ex-
planation.

Three weeks ago President
Wilson told the Ring-tum Phi
that his mind on the matter is
not yet made up. While it is not
ours to attempt to question the
thoughts of such a clearly
brilliant man as President
Wilson, it is vital to remain
evercognizant and watchful of
his moves. His speech to the
parents, which was unques-
tionable key in the formulation
of their ideas about the matter,
certainly should have raised
many warning flags among
those in the audience.

Introspection is healthy Lex High
as questions swarm

by BEN HALE

Will we go coed? Will we
abolish spring term? Will we
abolish Washington’s break?
Will the fraternity system be
reorganized? Will sophomores
soon have to live on campus?
Will the size of the student body
increase?

Questions buzz around us like
bees these days and replies are
swarming too. These questions
are raising tempers, shocking
people, sending people out to
research, and causing intro-
spective debate and discussion
that has been missing for so
long it seems odd. This in-
trospection is good, though it
may be painful for those of us
who are happy as we are. This
is a pain, however, that ought to
be suffered. We ought to ex-
amine ourselves and our life-
style(s) because examination
leads to better understanding,
appreciation, and improvement
(if and where it is possible. )

We take for granted our all-
male tradition with its special
camaraderie, its honor system
grounded in its noblesse oblige
of gentlemen, its academic
freedom unhampered by sex
and role playing, etc. When the
question of coeducation is rais-
ed, especially by an outsider,
we are shaken out of our com-
placency. We are forced to
scrutinize this tradition that is
assumed and accepted. We are
forced to question ourselves and

our reasons for cherishing this
tradition. This look inward may
not change our sentiments. In-
deed, in a thoughtful communi-
ty such as ours we probably had
sound reasons for clinging to
this tradition anyway. But be-
ing forced to formulate and ar-
ticulate (as well as doubt) these
reasons is a healthy exercise.

My View

 

 

(And there may be some views
that do change.)

This need for introspection
goes farther than the single-sex
We also take for granted our
celebrated Spring term, our
open living arrangements, our
strong fraternity system, and
endless other aspects of W&L
life that fit smoothly and
pleasantly into our groove.
Perhaps a little shaking of the
tree is in order. We ought to be
explicitly aware of our way of
life and to be able to explain it
and defend it to ourselves (as
well as the outside world). If
our unique lifestyle is as social-
ly and intellectually fertile as
most of us believe it to be, then
these annoying questions are
helpful because they may jolt us
to understand why it is so good
(or why not, if that be the case).
It is not in the W&L tradition of
sound thought and action to lead
an unexamined life.

read the Phi article if they have
any desire for a better grasp of

struck by the clear reporting of

Lexington businesses prosper

Parents’ Weekend income bolsters profits

By STEVEN POCKRASS
Staff Reporter

Although many area
businesses, restaurants and
hotels have reported higher
than normal sales on Washing-
ton and Lee’s 29th Annual
Parents’ Weekend, the late date
of this year’s parents’ weekend
may have cut into some local
merchants’ profits.

Hotels and motels do espe-
cially well on this weekend.
‘‘We were completely booked.
Most of our weekends are fully
booked. We are completely
booked for next years’
(Parents’) weekend,” said Don
Fredenburg of the 23-room
Alexander-Withrow House.

“It (Parents’ Weekend) does
have an impact on us here at
Natural Bridge,’’ said Winston
B. Tolley, general manager of
the Natural Bridge Hotel. But
Tolley also added that other
events such as the Virginia
Military Institute football game
and _ activities at Southern
Seminary Junior College also

increased business.
“Forty to 45 percent were
(W&L) parents.”

Other managers agreed with
Tolley that it was hard to judge
the percentage of W&L parents

‘due to other area activities.

Keydet-General Motel Manager
Maxine Holland said, “‘All the
weekends up to Parents Week-
end are good.’’ Miss Holland
already has 14 people on a
waiting list for next year at the
56-room hotel.

Connie Terry of Barnes Motel
felt that graduation weekend
probably resulted in a larger
turnout, but she said all of her
40 rooms were full this
weekend. Only when Barnes
Motel fills up do the managers
open the nearby Buena Vista
Motel, which was also full. Miss
Terry said that the 18-room
Buena Vista Motel is only open-
ed 10-15 times a year. The local
Econo Lodge was also filled up,
and expects to book all 48 rooms
for next year’s Parents’ Week-
end by February, according to
new managers Joan and Jack

 

EC

(continued from page 1)

After two weeks of what Jene-
vein described as ‘‘ruffling
feathers”’ of the law school, the
EC voted unanimously Monday
night not to require law stu-
dents to sign honor cards in
order to vote in EC elections.

“T’ve been assured that more
honor cards will be returned if
we don’t make this a require-
ment for the voting registration
list,” Jenevein said.

Vice-president Dave Judge
expressed the same opinion. “I
think we’ll get more cards, and
that’s the main purpose,’ he
said.

In supporting upperclass law
rep Jim Green’s motion not to
require signing of the cards for
voting in elections, Jenevein
also cited constitutional pro-
blems.

The question of house
mothers arose during the ODK
Symposium on community-uni-
versity relations last Wednes-
day, according to Jenevein.

Other questions raised were
the effectiveness of the honor
system and the disregard for
the speaking tradition and the
dress code.

“It was believed that we’ve
slipped a lot in a lot of different
ways,” Jenevein said. Although
sudden changes may not be wel-
come, he added, “‘It was sug-
gested that maybe they should
be forced until they’re
welcome.”’

An Assimilation Committee
at Washington and Lee used to
fine students for not speaking to
others on'‘campus or for walking
on the grass, Jenevein said.

“The students took pride in
that,’”’ he added. ‘‘They found

themselves on a higher plane
—above the Wahoos of UVa.

Jenevein also described
house mothers as ‘‘nothing but
a positive thing.”’

The EC unanimously approv-
ed junior rep Darby Brower’s
motion to recommend that the
Interfraternity Council  in-
vestigate the possibility of
reinstating house mothers.

In other action, the EC heard
budget reports from the Student
Activities Board and the Film
Society.

Andy Cooney reported that
the SAB is doing ‘‘better than
last year,” although ‘“‘Saturday
night bands (in the Cockpit)
have pretty much killed us.”’

No revenues were reported
for the SAB’s two Saturday
night bands — the Phonecops
and Public Service.

The SAB lost $21 on the White
Animals Oct. 11 because of what
Cooney described as ‘‘a lack of
communication.”

The band was to receive 85
percent of the receipts, minus
the $90 deposit already paid to
it. However, the person calcu-
lating the receipts that evening
did not figure in that deposit
and the band was thus overpaid
by about $100.

“It’s kind of hard to go up (to
the group) and say, ‘We did
this. Can you give us our money
back?’ ” Cooney said.

Both the films and the Fall
Weekend have done well finan-
cially, Cooney said, adding that
the continuation of Fall Week-
end would depend upon the
scheduling of Homecoming.

Cooney also said a weekend
was being worked out for Janu-
ary between the SAB and the
lacrosse team that would

Howard.

Restaurants and businesses
also noted increases. Spanky’s
Assistant Manager Jayne Plog-
ger noted approximately a 50
percent increase.

Connie Hostetter of the Palms
said, “Business goes up 70 to 75
percent. Parents’ weekend is
really the biggest (weekend of
the year).”’

Howard Johnson’s Emory
Smith feels that business went
up five to ten percent, but ‘‘it’s
been hard to figure the last two
years.” ,

Even movie attendance was
up for the weekend. According
to Lyric Theatre Manager Dale
Tomlin, attendance increases,
“whenever we have a big
event.”’ He estimated a 50 per-
cent increase in business for
last weekend. ‘It was the best
one of the year” for Alvin-
Dennis (apparrel shop) said
owner Alvin Carter of last
weekend. His reductions entic-
ed people to shop, and
“business goes up  con-
siderably.”

 

 

EC proposes referendum

on new grade scale

Following the initiative of
sophomore EC rep Darby
Brower and a W&L senior, the
Executive Committee decided
Monday to schedule a school-
wide referendum vote on the
new plus-or-minus. grading
scale for the week following
Thanksgiving vacation.

In the Oct. 31 EC meeting,
Brower brought to the floor a
suggestion from senior Parker
Schenecker that the new grade
scale should only affect the
freshman class as that was the
only class which entered the
university under the new scale.

Brower said he suggested to
the EC that a referendum vote
be held and that the results then
be taken to the faculty.

Although the faculty voted in
the spring of 1982 to adopt the
new grade scale to become ef-

fective this fall, some members:

of the EC maintain that the
faculty should reconsider press-
ing the new scale on the upper
three classes.

“It’s certainly a school-wide
issue,’’ said EC President Bob

Jenevein. ‘The Executive Com-
mittee foresees a request that
the faculty postpone application
of that policy on the three upper
classes for as long as those
three upper classes are here.”’

“If I didn’t think that the stu-
dent sentiment would be
against this, I wouldn’t think
that there would be any reason
to take a poll,’’ Jenevein said.
“IT hope that there is faculty
sympathy for what the students
think.”

 

“It’s certainly
a school-wide
issue.

--Bob Jenevein

 

The faculty has one last
scheduled meeting on Dec. 5 in
which it might examine the
referendum before the end of
Fall term when the scale will be
first applied.

ed that a poll on the advantages
and disadvantages of spring

naires should be returned by
Dec. 7.

Junior rep Cole Dawson,
reporting for the open exam
subcommittee, said, “It's going

real well. I’ve gotten all the
logistics of the C-School worked
out.”’

He will formally present the
plan to the Faculty Executive
Committee Nov. 28. If approved
by that committee, the policy
would go to the University
Council and finally to the whole
faculty for approval the follow-
ing Monday, he said.

“It’s pretty much split both
ways,” Dawson said of the
Faculty EC’s opinion of the
idea. “Some of the faculty
members are for it, some are
against it.”’

Report to parents

(continued from page 1)

Wilson briefly outlined the
pros and cons of coeducation for
the parents and explained that
he hopes that a final decision on
the issue can be made by May.

“It was a question of whether
or not we are truly talking about
an all-male experience or a
male-female experience of a
very special sort,’’ Wilson said.

Wilson emphasized the point
that society has shifted since
W&L’s founding in the 18th cen-
tury so that women now ‘“‘par-
ticipate in the shaping of socie-
ty.”

Claiming that Washington
and Lee has become isolated

from an important part of the
educational culture, Wilson said
coeducation may be “‘the only
sensible way to protect our
selectivity.”

Wilson called the decision he
must make regarding his rec-
ommendation to the Board of
Trustees ‘‘a wonderfully
frightening obligation, but it’s
one that I truly relish.”

He added, though, that
“‘there’s something going on in
the W&L experience — it may
not be gender-fixed, but it
may,’ and for that reason
“we're going to study it
(coeducation) as carefully and

future without setting this ques-
tion aside for yay or nay,”’ he
added.

‘“‘We must ask, ‘How can we

Wilson also reported to the
parents on the problems with
the fraternities and the process
by which they were being solv-
ed and repeated his goal of hav-
ing more on-campus housing.

In his opening remarks,
Wilson talked about the many
changes Robert E. Lee made as
president of the school only five
months after the end of the Civil
War. These included making
chapel attendance voluntary,
no longer requiring the classi-
cal curriculum and establishing
the new code of student regula-
tions by which W&L students
abide today.

“These changes were not
evolutionary, but revolu-
tionary,” Wilsonsaid. _

Other Parent’s Weekend ac-
tivities included meetings with
faculty members, open houses
in many departments on cam-
pus, a Glee Club concert, a
President’s Reception Friday
night and Saturday afternoon’s
football game.

CIA worse than KGB

Stockwell criticizes US world image

John Stockwell, the highest-
ranking Central Intelligence
Agency case officer to criticize
the agency’s policies publicly,
told a Washington and Lee Uni-
versity audience last Thursday
that the United States is seen
throughout the world ‘‘as just as
dangerous and dirty as the KGB
and the Russians ever were”
because of the CIA’s covert
operations throughout the
world.

First Lt. Syd Farrar, the 1980
W&L graduate injured in the
Grenada invasion, said Wednes-
day that he is ‘feeling real
well” and expects to be releas-
ed from Walter Reed Hospital

and transfered to Fort Stewart,
Ga., where he will stay for a few
days before being released in
time for Thanksgiving holiday.
“l’m walking around and

feeling real good,’ Farrar said
from his hospital room. “I’ve
got about six pins in my arm
and my chest has healed up
nicely.”

Farrar added that he was
pleased to receive the game ball
from the Washington and Lee-
Catholic University football

game.
“I’m mighty proud of that,”’
he said.

in his speech, has been directly
responsible for the deaths of 1
million people and ‘‘two million
more in the Vietnam War and
then the starvation in Cambodia
and killing there.”’

“The survivors know that
these people were killed by the
CIA and they do not love Ameri-
ca and Americans for it,’’ said
Stockwell, referring to various
operations in Africa, Asia, and
Central America.

‘“‘Now after 35 years of this, if
we had great credibility in 1945
in comparison with the Rus-
sions, we don’t now. The world
sees us as being just as
dangerous and dirty as the KGB
and the Russians ever were,”
Stockwell said.

Stockwell charged in his lec-
ture that the CIA and the Na-
tional Security Council routine-
ly lie to the American people
about their operations abroad.

“T saw lies at every level of
the program,” Stockwell said.
“Truth has no applicability to
the covert activities of the CIA
or the operations of the United
States in places like Grenada.”

Stockwell said that secrecy in
such covert activities is not a
matter of protecting the opera-
tion but is ‘‘designed to keep the
American people from knowing
what is happening..,’

Further, Stockwell contended
that the Reagan administration
“wants to lead us into another
war.

“It’s madness. The world is
like the hull of an ancient
wooden ship that is filled with
explosives, and the United
States is in the business of play-
ing with matches,” Stockwell
said.

‘Rashomon’ closes its run with success

But much of the behind-the-scenes work is never seen

sively by Martinez from the
beginning of October to the
opening night of the play for
their fight.

Martinez forged the swords
used in the play out of steel by
the middle of October. Before
that, Cartmill and Richardson
used sticks.

While all this was going on,
Tom Ziegler’s Drama 131 class
was working on the costumes,
publicity, set building, and the
building of props for the play.
Each student put in roughly:
four hours of work a week to
keep up with the progression of
the play.

cast was ready for the “‘block-

The set has been struck at
Washington and Lee’s Trouba-
dour Theatre. The sawdust has
been swept up and the costumes
have been stored.

For six nights the stage of the
W&L theatre took the form of a
Japanese field around 900 A.D.
in the eyes of those in the au-
dience.

What people who attended the
play didn’t see was the many
hours spent to ‘make sure the
finished product would meet the
public’s expectations.

Originally, the department’s
fall production was supposed to
be “A Funny Thing Happen-
ed on the Way to the Forum.”’

Martinez had the problem of
replacing three cast members
throughout the course of the
play. Fortunately, there was on-
ly one major character replac-
ed, and that was done by the end
of September.

‘‘Rashomon’’ features a
scene in which two characters
engage in a sword battle. This is
where Martinez’ expertise was
needed. Chris Cartmill and Ned

the show. Set builders and prop
gatherers were adding the
finishing touches, as were the
people in charge of costumes.
Most of the class were required
to attend the ‘‘dry-tech”’ rehear-
sal on Oct. 30 and to be at the
playhouse nightly until the run
of the show was completed.

The ‘‘dry-tech’’ rehearsal
took eight hours, and the play
was not even completely run
through. In a “‘dry-tech,” every
scene is done to get the cues in

more for the lighting and sound
technicians’ benefit than for the
actors’.

The run of the play went fair-
ly well. Martinez, whom Cart-
mill and Richardson say is an
“intense perfectionist,’ said
the first show was “‘okay,” but
added that the cast was “‘dis-
oriented somewhat by the au-
dience.”

The show was not without its
faults, however. During the
opening night performance
water shot into the first two
rows from a valve opened too
far. The water was supposed to
run onto a gate. The cardinal
sin of the W&L Drama Depart-
ment was committed; someone
upstairs let the phone ring,

audience. Watch alarms went
off both backstage and in the
audience.

New movie offers little more

By CHARLIE ALCORN
Special to the Phi

The new James Bond movie is
on the streets and ready for lus-
ty viewing by all you minks out
there suffering from early
winter blues. Never Say Never
Again is a fun movie, but it could
be dangerous to anybody with
an I.Q. over 90. Who cares if it
has the most asinine plodding
screenplay in the history of
film? What it does have is the
real Bond, Sean Connery, for
the first time since he abdicated
the title after Diamonds Are
Forever (1971) and enough skin
(we're talking all-world) and
stunts to keep any red blooded
W&L boy happy.

Burdette Trio is well

By CHRISTOPHER DEIGHAN
Special to the Phi

A receptive crowd welcomed
a musical trio in Lee Chapel this
past Monday evening as the
Washington and Lee Concert
Guild began its series of four
performances.

The Burdette Trio, a group of
superior artists: violinist David
Kim, pianist Jungeun Kim and
cellist Robert Cafaro, perform-
ed three sensational works by
Ludwing van Beethoven,
Ernest Bloch and Johannes
Brahms.

Beethoven’s “Trio in E-flat
Major, Opus 1, No. 1’’ carried
the audience through a transi-
tion of bright movement to gen-
tle sorrow and then to a finale of

climactic excitement.
The musicians’ expression

about the direction this movie is
going to take. The women are
above average even for a Bond
flick. Fatima Blush (Barbara
Carrera) gives new meaning to
the word wedgie in one scene.
And the All-American blonde
Domino (Kim Bassinger) is
spectacular. My favorite scene
involves Domino being sold into
slavery by a fat bedouin from
the Sudan and Bond sweeping
her away on horseback and
leaping off a 100-foot wall —
horse and all. Heck yea! If
you’re going to be mindless at
least have a great imagination.
This kind of scene is typical of
the whole movie, which I
suspect won’t be in line for an
Academy Award (perhaps a

tion and fascinating syncopa-
tion exhibited their remarkable
talent and sense of unity of
sound.

The contemporary style of
Bloch’s “Three Nocturnes’’
refreshed the classical style of
Beethoven and earned the trio
an explosion of applause as the
first half of the program con-
cluded. Three times the group
was called back to receive the
audience’s praise.

Following the intermission,
the three musicians performed
Brahms’ “Trio in B Major,
Opus 8,’’ impressing upon the
listeners feelings of calm har-
mony which suddenly devel-
oped into raging excitement.
The violin, piano and cello ef-
fectively played off one
another, one instrument pro-

Weekend.

After the show, the actors
removed their costumes and
their make up, which they had
applied themselves nightly.
They were finished with the
show. But for Ziegler’s 131
class, one painstaking day was
left: the day the set was torn
down, known as ‘“‘striking the
set.”” Packaging the costumes
that were rented, tearing down
the set that was scarcely three
weeks old, and carrying the
many props across the street to

the Boiler Room Theatre and

the storage area next to it are

_ all involved in the day-long pro-

cess.

For Martinez and the actors,
they have a feeling of ac-
complishment for the play,
which gained approval from
most of the people who attend-
ed. For Drama 131 students,
they hope to gain the ‘‘A” that
comes with all the monotonous
work and recent nights spent in
the Troubador Theatre.

ty). The villians are nearly as
ominous as in other Bond ven-
tures and the special effects are
not quite as futuristic as was ex-
pected (ie. you might find
some of the gadgets in a
Sharper Image catalogue). Also
the title song is not the usual top
40 smash of recent Bond flicks.

What makes this film is Con-
nery, who is the undisputable
Bond in my book. He is graying

stout, but there is no question
when he beds Fatima Blush or

Generals thrash Dutchmen, 41-15

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals finished the 1983
season Saturday with a 41-15
thrashing of the Lebanon Valley
“Flying Dutchmen.” The vic-
tory, which gave the Generals a
final record of 6-3, secured W&L
a second-place tie in the ODAC
with Randolph-Macon and
Emory and Henry behind con-
ference champion Hampden-
Sydney.

Saturday’s win also included
two’ milestones for record-
setting tailback Gene Girard.
Girard, who gained 157 yards on
28 rushes, established a new
W&L single-season rushing
mark during the first half
against Lebanon Valley. He
also became the first General
player to pass 1,000 yards
rushing in a season since the
end of subsidized athletics at
W&L in 1953. Girard totaled
1,011 yards on 209 carries in
1983.

The Generals got off to a
shaky start against Lebanon
Valley, spotting the Flying
Dutchmen an early 7-0 lead.
After receiving the opening
kick-off, Lebanon Valley drove
for a touchdown, scoring on a
six-yard pass from James
Algeo to Bob Kransley less than
six minutes into the game.

The Generals suffered
another setback only minutes
later when quarterback Bobby
Wilson went down with an in-
jured knee on their fifth offen-
sive play. However, on the next
play, Girard took a hand-off
from Wilson’s replacement,
freshman Jon Thornton, and
raced 72 yards for a touchdown
with 6:51 remaining in the first
quarter. James White added the
first of his five extra points on
the day, tying the score at 7-7.

Girard scored three more
times all on short runs, before
intermission, and the Generals
coasted to a comfortable 28-7
half-time lead.

Late in the third quarter,

senior defensive end Charlie
Alcorn recovered a_ blocked
punt in the end zone, increasing

the Generals’ lead to 34-7.
Freshman Kevin Weaver
scored the last General touch-

down on a one-yard run with
10:19 remaining in the game,
making the score 41-7.

Lebanon Valley scored a late
touchdown on quarterback
James Algeo’s three-yard pass
to Jim Reilly. Algeo also passed
for the two-point conversion,
making the final score 41-15.

Head coach Gary Fallon had
nothing but praise for his
team’s performance during the
1983 season, particularly that of
his seniors and Girard.

“‘T couldn’t be happier for the
seniors on this football team
that they could go through four
years here and be winners all
the way through,” Fallon said.
“In fact, the way this progress-
ed, [’m really sorry to see it
end.”’

Fallon also lauded the perfor-
mance of Girard.

“Gene worked hard for
everything he got this year. He
came back to school on August
9, ahead of everyone else, just
to get himself in shape. You
couldn’t ask for a better team
player,” stated Fallon. “Of
course, Gene’s record is also a
tribute to the steady play of our
offensive line, to the blocking of
fullback Frank Surface, and to
the blocking of our wide re-
ceivers. Everyone shares in
that achievement.”’

Fallon would take none of the
credit for the successful season
himself as he gave it all to his
staff.

‘‘My hat is off to our coaching
staff,’ said Fallon. ‘‘When we
started this season, there were
plenty of question marks. But
the coaches got our players to
perform at their highest level.
The record is a credit to the
staff.”’

Fallon is not about to relax
after his team’s performance in
1983. He is already planning for
the next season.

‘‘We had some young players
who really grew up in a hurry
this season,’ Fallon _ said.
‘“‘There are some obvious holes
that we’ll have to plug up be-
tween now and next fall, but I
think everyone connected with
the program is already looking
forward to next season.”

 

Generals set

By WILLIAM KING
Staff Reporter

The 1983 Washington and Lee
football team was a record-
setting one as six school marks
were broken during the season.

Gene Girard was responsible
for four of these by establishing
single-season highs in rushing
and scoring. Girard, a junior
from Coral Gables, Fla., rushed
for 1,011 yards during the
season, surpassing the record of
928 yards set by Stewart Atkin-

son in 1979.

He also broke three scoring
records for rushing touch-
downs, total touchdowns and
total points, by scoring 15 touch-
downs, 14 of which came on the
ground, and one two-point con-
version for 92 total points. In ad-

 

six records

dition, Girard was the first
1,000-yard rusher since W&L
eliminated subsidized athletics
in 1953.

James White also placed his
name in the W&L record books
by setting a new single-season
mark for successful point-after-
touchdown conversions. White
was good on 29 PATs, six more
than the 1981 record of 23 held
by Bill Devine.

The last record set in 1983
belongs to freshman Kevin
Weaver. Against , Maryville,
Weaver returned the opening
kick-off 100 yards for a touch-
down, breaking the record of 93
yards established in 1979 by
Chris Leiser. Weaver was the
second. leading rusher for the
Generals in 1983, totalling 376
yards on 68 carries.

With high hopes for a suc-

p.m. Wednesday. Then on Fri-
day W&L will compete against
Johns Hopkins while the Sweet
Briar College team will swim

against Johns Hopkins’
women’s team. That meet also
begins at 7 p.m.

‘“‘We’re jumping right into the
thick of things at the outset,”’
said W&L head aquatics coach
Page Remillard. ‘‘One of the

biggest questions facing us in-

volves ‘a number of very tal- .

ented freshmen. Until we get in-
to our season, we really won’t
know how they will make the
transition from high school to
college although we’re very en-
couraged by the practices.”’

The Generals will return All-
America performer Gary
Meyer, a senior who specializes
in the freestyle sprint events
and finished 11th in the national
competition in the 100-yard
freestyle last year.

Also returning is sophomore
John Moody who qualified for

the national meet last year in

the butterfly.
Some of the promising
newcomers include Bryan

Chaffe and divers Joe Donovan
and Matt DiVito as well as three
freshmen who also competed in
water polo — Jim Savage of
North Tonawanda, N.Y., Dan
Trice of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and
Jay ReVille of Raleigh, N.C.

Following Friday’s dual meet
with Johns Hopkins, the Gener-
als will be competing in the
W&L Senior Invitational on
Saturday and Sunday, also at
Twombly Pool.

Polo drops two at Easterns;
finishes season at 25-12

By DAVID NAVE
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team captured one
victory against two losses to
finished seventh in the NCAA
Division I Eastern Water Polo
Championships, held last
weekend at the U.S. Naval
Academy. The Generals de-
feated the University of
Massachusetts, and lost to Slip-
pery Rock and _ Richmond.
W&L’s 1-2 performance last
weekend gives them a final
season record of 25-12.

According to Assistant Water
Polo Coach Bob Newcomb, Tim
Rock and Bobby Pearson
played exceptionally well for
the Generals last weekend.
Rock scored five goals and
Pearson scored six during the
weekend.

The Generals dropped their
first game of the tournament to
third seeded Slippery Rock, 10-
6. Although the game was even
after the first quarter, Slippery
Rock possessed a 6-4 lead at

‘halftime. According to Coach

Newcomb, “Slippery Rock con-
trolled the entire game.”
Newcomb said, ‘‘They (Slip-
pery Rock) were on this week-
end. To lose to a team like that
when they are playing that well
is not bad.”’

Slippery Rock upset second-
seeded Navy 16-10, in the semi-
finals. The victory placed Slip-
pery Rock in the finals against
Brown and gave them a berth in
the national water polo tourna-
ment.

The Generals lost a close
game against Richmond by a
score of 7-4 in W&L’s second
game. Richmond avenged their
loss to the Generals in the finals
of the Southern League Cham-
pionships, when they scored the
winning goal with 26 seconds re-
maining inthe game.

The Generals rebounded from
their two losses to earn a vic-
tory against the University of
Massachusetts. The Generals
won, 6-5.

“We were in control most of
the game, but we could never

break it open,’’ Newcomb said.
He added, ‘‘The Richmond
game took a lot out of us men-
tally. It was hard losing to them
for the fourth time (this
season).”’

Coach Newcomb believes that
the 1983 W&L water polo season
was a great success. ‘“‘We are
upset that we lost to Richmond
(at the Easterns) but we are
still very, very pleased with the
season and how it came out,’’ he
said.

According to Newcomb,
coaches and officials at the
Easterns last weekend noticed
and remarked on W&L’s im-
provement from the beginning
to the end of the season.

“It would have been really
nice to earn a berth to the Na-
tional tournament,’’ said
Newcomb. He concluded, how-
ever, ‘‘The main thing we were
looking for this season was what

_ we accomplished.”

The Generals’ accomplish-
ment: their third consecutive
Southern League Title.

Hoops begins with

Lip-Off Tourney

By BOB BRYANT
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
Generals will begin the 1983-84
basketball season when they
host three teams in the W&L
Tip-Off Tournament Friday and
Saturday in Warner Center.

The tournament will begin at
7 p.m. Friday when John Jay
College of New York City meets
Eastern College of St. David’s,
Pa. The 1983-84 basketball
Generals will make their debut
at 9 p.m. against the State
University of Old Westbury,
N.Y.

The winners of these two
games will meet in the cham-
pionship game Saturday at 9
p.m., which follows the consola-
tion game at 7 p.m. between the
two losing teams.

“Old Westbury finished with
a 19-2 mark a year ago and has
nine lettermen from that team
returning,’’ noted W&L Head
Coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘We ex-
pect them to be formidable to
say the least.”’

But, Canfield adds, his team
has “worked hard, and I think
we’re ready for an excellent ef-

fort in the tournament.”’

The Generals have lost three
of last year’s starters, who
helped the team finish with a
17-10 record. “‘We’ve still got
some adjustments to make,”
said Canfield, who expects to be
experimenting with his team’s
lineup in the tournament. ‘I
want to find the right chemistry
out there on the court.”

The two returning starters
this year are senior co-captains
John Lee Graves, a 6-foot-5 for-
ward, and Chris Baldwin, a 5-
foot-9 point guard. New to the
Starting lineup are juniors
Kevin McClatchy, a_ 6-foot
guard, and Scott Shannon, a 6-
foot-5 forward.

The fifth starter will be a
freshman forward, either Rob
Spencer (6-foot-4) or Keith
Brideweser (6-foot-6). Spencer
made Canfield’s decision easier
by turning his ankle in practice
last week. ‘‘His availability for
the tournament is uncertain,”
said the coach.

Sixth man Lex Fitzenhagen, a
6-foot-2 junior, will see plenty of
action at guard and/or forward,
Canfield added.

 

Time Out-

(continued from page 7)

weekend. Jimmy’s joy and fun
cost him $1750 in fines for
various visible and audible
obscenities...For those of you
who are college hoops-minded,
here’s a name to look for as the
seasons change. Ken Smith, a
freshman playing for Dean
Smith, is already turning heads
with his authoritarian slam
dunks and should continue to do
so as the Tar Heels whip up on
the rest of the ACC...
..The Prince from No-Man’s-
Land (er, New Jersey) barely
escaped with his life after his
Hagler-Duran prophecy. As you
head home to feast, he leaves
Duran fight as well as he did
last Thursday. The fight also
showed how marvelous Mr.
Hagler really is. He knew he
had to win the last two rounds,
and despite a cut over the left
eye, the champ proved worthy
of his title. Hagler’s certainly
among the best middleweights
in history and should never lose
the title...Our old friend Jimmy
Connors is behaving like an
adolescent again. “They are

taking all the fun and joy out of

- the game,”’ said Connors who

lost to a well-behaved (yes, it’s
true) John McEnroe over the
you with these royal words:
‘The Prince respectfully kneels
at the feet of Roberto Duran.
Duran lost but he certainly beat
me.’ About the big heavy-
weight bout (as opposed to a lit-
tle heavyweight bout) featuring
Larry Holmes and Marvis
Frazier, the Prince has this: “It
smells alot like Spinks-Ali I to
me, but that was almost a
miracle. Holmes by split deci-
sion. Maybe next time for Mar-
Va;3."

...1 leave you with something
from the Believe it or Not
Dept.: Kevin Morgan, the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch’s Schol-
astic Player of the Year, had
what some would consider a
good season in his final high,
school game, as he rushed for a
mere 319 yards and just seven
touchdowns. Kevin also works
full-time on defense. Yes but
does he do windows? Enjoy
your break. At least one of us
should.... :
